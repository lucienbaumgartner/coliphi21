There is a boundary (a line) separating Maryland and\nPennsylvania. There is a boundary (a circle) isolating the interior of\na disc from its exterior. There is a boundary (a surface) enclosing\nthe bulk of this apple. Sometimes the exact location of a boundary is\nunclear or otherwise controversial (as when you try to trace out the\nmargins of Mount Everest, or even the boundary of your own\nbody). Sometimes the boundary lies skew to any physical discontinuity\nor qualitative differentiation (as with the border of Wyoming, or the\nboundary between the upper and lower halves of a homogeneous\nsphere). But whether sharp or blurry, natural or artificial, for every\nobject there appears to be a boundary that marks it off from the rest\nof the world. Events, too, have boundaries — at least temporal\nboundaries. Our lives are bounded by our births and by our deaths; the\nsoccer game began at 3pm sharp and ended with the referee's final\nwhistle at 4:45pm. It is sometimes suggested that even abstract\nentities, such as concepts or sets, have boundaries of their own, and\nWittgenstein could emphatically proclaim that the boundaries of our\nlanguage are the boundaries of our world (1921: 5.6). Whether all this\nboundary talk is coherent, however, and whether it reflects the\nstructure of the world or simply the organizing activity of our mind,\nare matters of deep philosophical controversy.\n\n\n\nEuclid defined a boundary as “that which is an extremity of\nanything” (Elements Bk I, Df 13), and Aristotle made\nthis more precise by defining the extremity of a thing x as\n“the first point beyond which it is not possible to find any\npart [of x], and the first point within which every part\n[of x] is.” (Metaphysics V, 17, 1022a4–5) This\ndefinition is intuitive enough and may be regarded as the natural\nstarting point for any investigation into the concept of a\nboundary. Indeed, although Aristotle's definition was only meant to\napply to material substances, it intuitively applies to events as well\n(insofar as they have mereological structure) and by extension also to\nabstract entities such as concepts and sets (compare the topologically\nstandard notion of the boundary of a set x as the set of\nthose points all of whose neighborhoods intersect both x and\nthe complement of x). Nonetheless, precisely this intuitive\ncharacterization gives rise to several puzzles that justify\nphilosophical concern, especially with respect to the boundaries of\nspatio-temporal particulars such as objects and events. \n\nThe first sort of puzzle relates to the intuition that a boundary\nseparates two entities (or two parts of the same entity),\nwhich are then said to be continuous with each other. Imagine\nourselves traveling from Maryland to Pennsylvania. What happens as we\ncross the Mason-Dixon line? Do we pass through a last point p\nin Maryland and a first point q in Pennsylvania? Clearly not,\ngiven the density of the continuum; for then we should have to admit\nan infinite number of further points between p and q\nthat would be in neither State. But, equally clearly, we can hardly\nacknowledge the existence of just one of p and q, as\nis dictated by the standard mathematical treatment of the continuum,\nfor either choice would amount to a peculiar privileging of one State\nover the other. And we cannot identify\np with q, either, for we are speaking of two adjacent\nStates, so their territories cannot have any parts in common. So,\nwhere is the Mason-Dixon line, and how does it relate to the\ntwo adjacent entities it separates? \n\nThe puzzle can be generalized. Consider the dilemma raised by Leonardo\nin his Notebooks: What is it that divides the atmosphere from\nthe water? Is it air or is it water? (1938: 75–76). Or consider\nSuárez's worry in Disputation 40 (Sect. V, §58),\nrepeatedly echoed by Peirce (1892: 546; 1893: 7.127): What color is\nthe line of demarcation between a black spot and its white background?\nPerhaps figure/ground considerations could be invoked to provide an\nanswer in this second case, based on the principle that the boundary\nis always owned by the figure — the background is topologically\nopen (Jackendoff 1987, App. B). But what is figure and what is ground\nwhen it comes to two adjacent halves of the same black spot? What is\nfigure and what is ground when it comes to Maryland and Pennsylvania?\nWhat happens when we dive into the water? Besides, it would be natural\nto suppose that all entities of the same sort be treated alike, for\ninstance, that all material bodies be construed as figure-like\nentities, each possessing its own boundary. But then, how could any\ntwo of them ever come into contact, short of penetrability? (In this\nlast form, the question is widely discussed in recent literature; see\ne.g. Kline and Matheson 1987, Hazen 1990, Zimmerman 1996b, Kilborn\n2007.) \n\nConsider also Aristotle's classical version of the puzzle in regard to\ntemporal boundaries: When a moving object comes to rest, is it in\nmotion or is it at rest? (Physics VI, 3, 234a ff.) Of course,\none could maintain that there is no motion or rest at an\ninstant, but only during an interval, as Aristotle himself\nheld (232a32–34). Yet the question remains: Does the transitional\nmoment belong to the motion interval or to the rest interval? (On this\nversion of the puzzle, see Medlin 1963, Hamblin 1969, Kretzmann 1976,\nand Sorabji 1983, ch. 26.) \n\nA second sort of puzzle relates to the fact that Aristotle's\nmereological definition, and the common-sense intuition that it\ncaptures, only seem to apply to the realm of continuous\nentities. Modulo the above-mentioned difficulty, the thought that\nMaryland and Pennsylvania are bounded by the Mason-Dixon line is fair\nenough. But ordinary material objects — it might be observed\n— are not truly continuous (or dense) and speaking of an\nobject's boundary is like speaking of the “flat top” of a\nfakir's bed of nails (Simons 1991: 91). On closer inspection, the\nspatial boundaries of physical objects are imaginary entities\nsurrounding swarms of subatomic particles, and their exact shape and\nlocation involve the same degree of idealization of a drawing obtained\nby “connecting the dots”, the same degree of arbitrariness\nas any mathematical graph smoothed out of scattered and inexact data,\nthe same degree of abstraction as the figures' contours in a Seurat\npainting. Similarly, on closer inspection a body's being in motion\namounts to the fact that the vector sum of the motions of zillions of\nrestless particles, averaged over time, is non-zero, hence it makes no\nsense to speak of the instant at which a body stops moving\n(Galton 1994: 4). All this may be seen as good\nnews vis-à-vis the puzzles of Section 1.1, which would\nnot even get off the ground (at least in the form given above; see\nS. R. Smith 2007 and Wilson 2008 for qualifications). But then the\nquestion arises: Is our boundary talk a mere façon de\nparler? \n\nEven with reference to the Mason-Dixon line — and, more\ngenerally, those boundaries that demarcate adjacent parts of a\ncontinuous manifold, as when an individual cognitive agent\nconceptualizes a black spot as being made of two halves — one\ncan raise the question of their ontological status. Such boundaries\nreflect to various degrees the organizing activity of our intellect,\nor of our social practices. And it might be argued that belief in\ntheir objectivity epitomizes a form of metaphysical realism that cries\nfor justification. We may, in this connection, introduce a conceptual\ndistinction between natural or bona fide boundaries, which\nare in some sense objective, i.e., grounded in some physical\ndiscontinuity or qualitative heterogeneity betwixt an entity and its\nsurroundings, and artificial or fiat boundaries, which are\nnot so grounded in the autonomous, mind-independent world (B. Smith\n1995, building on Curzon 1907). Geo-political boundaries such as the\nMason-Dixon line are obviously of the fiat sort, and on\ncloser inspection it appears that even the surfaces of ordinary\nmaterial objects such as apples and tables involve fiat\narticulations of some kind. So the question is, are\nthere any bona fide boundaries? And, if not, is\nthe fiat nature of our boundary talk a reason to justify an\nanti-realist attitude towards boundaries altogether? (Compare also how\nthe issue arises in the realm of abstract entities: Are there concepts\nthat carve the world “at the joints”, as per Plato's\nrecipe in the Phaedrus 265e?) \n\nThe question has deep ramifications. For once the fiat/bona\nfide opposition has been recognized, it is clear that it can be\ndrawn in relation to whole objects and events also (Smith and Varzi\n2000, Smith 2001). Insofar as (part of) the boundary of a whole is of\nthe fiat sort, the whole itself may be viewed as a conceptual\nconstruction, hence the question of the ontological status of\nboundaries becomes of a piece with the more general issue of the\nconventional status of ordinary objects and events. Cfr. Goodman:\n“We make a star as we make a constellation, by putting its parts\ntogether and marking off its boundaries” (1980: 213) This is not\nto imply that we end up with imaginary or otherwise unreal wholes: as\nFrege wrote, the objectivity of the North Sea “is not affected\nby the fact that it is a matter of our arbitrary choice which part of\nall the water on the earth's surface we mark off and elect to call the\n‘North Sea’” (1884, §26). It does, however,\nfollow that the entities in question would only enjoy an individuality\nas a result of our fiat, like the cookies carved out of the\nbig dough: their objectivity is independent, but their individuality\n— their being what they are, perhaps even their having the\nidentity and persistence conditions they have — would depend on\nthe baker's action (Sidelle 1989; Heller 1990; Jubien 1993; Varzi\n2011). \n\nA third puzzle relates to vagueness. Aristotle's definition (as well\nas standard topology) suggests that there is always a sharp\ndemarcation between the inside and the outside of a thing. Yet it may\nbe observed that ordinary objects and events, as well as the\nextensions of many ordinary concepts, may have boundaries that are in\nsome sense fuzzy or indeterminate. Clouds, deserts, mountains, let\nalone the figures of an impressionist painting, all seem to elude the\nidealized notion of a sharply bounded entity. Likewise, the temporal\nboundaries of many events, let alone their spatial boundaries, seem to\nbe indeterminate.  When exactly did the industrial revolution begin?\nWhen did it end?  Where did it take place? And certainly the concepts\ncorresponding to such predicates as ‘bald’ or\n‘heap’ do not posses definite boundaries, either. As again\nFrege famously put it, to such concepts there seems to correspond\n“an area that ha[s] not a sharp boundary-line all around, but in\nplaces just vaguely fade[s] away into the background” (1903:\n§56). \n\nHow is such fuzziness to be construed? One option is insist on a\npurely epistemic account: the fuzziness would lie exclusively in our\nignorance about the exact location of the relevant boundaries\n(Sorensen 1988, Williamson 1994). Alternatively, one may distinguish\nhere between a de re account and a de dicto\naccount. On the de re account, the fuzziness is truly\nontological; the boundary of Mount Everest (say) would be vague\ninsofar as there is no objective, determinate fact of the matter about\nwhich parcels of land lie on which side (Tye 1990; Copeland 1995;\nAkiba 2004; Hyde 2008).  Likewise, on this account a predicate such as\n‘bald’ would be vague because it stands for a vague set, a\nset with truly fuzzy boundaries. By contrast, the de dicto\naccount corresponds to a purely linguistic (or conceptual) notion of\nvagueness. There is no vague boundary demarcating Mount Everest on\nthis view; rather, there are many distinct parcels of land, each with\na precise border, but our linguistic practices have not enforced a\nchoice of any one of them as the official referent of the name\n‘Everest’ (Mehlberg 1958; Lewis 1986; McGee\n1997). Similarly, on this view the set of bald people does not have a\nfuzzy boundary; rather, our linguistic stipulations do not fully\nspecify which set of people corresponds to the extension of\n‘bald’ (Fine 1975; Keefe 2000). For boundaries of\nthe fiat sort, a de dicto account suggests itself\nnaturally: insofar as the process leading to the definition of a\nboundary may not be precise, the question of whether something lies\ninside or outside the boundary may be semantically indeterminate. But\nthis account does not sit well with boundaries of the bona\nfide sort (if any); if any such boundary were vague, it would be\nso independently of our cognitive or social articulations, hence a\nde re account would seem to be necessary, which means that\nthere would be genuine worldly indeterminacy. \n\nA fourth source of concern relates to the intuition, implicit in\nAristotle's definition, that boundaries are lower-dimensional\nentities, i.e., have at least one dimension fewer than the entities\nthey bound.  The surface of a (continuous) sphere, for example, is\ntwo-dimensional (it has no “substance” or “divisible\nbulk”), the Mason-Dixon Line is one-dimensional (it has\n“length” but no “breadth”), and a boundary\npoint such as the vertex of a cone is zero-dimensional (it extends\nin no direction). This intuition is germane to much of what we\nordinarily say about boundaries. But it is problematic insofar as it\ncontrasts with several independent intuitions that are of a piece with\nboth common sense and philosophical theorizing. For instance, there is\na standing tradition in epistemology (from Moore 1925 to Gibson 1979)\naccording to which boundaries play a crucial role in perception: we\nsee (opaque) physical objects indirectly by seeing their surfaces. Yet\nit is not clear how one could see entities that lack physical\nbulk.  Likewise, we often speak of surfaces as of things that may be\npitted, or damp, or that can be scratched, polished, sanded, and so\non, and it is unclear whether such predicates can be applied at all to\nimmaterial entities. In such cases, it would rather seem that surfaces\n(and boundaries more generally; see Jackendoff 1991) are to be\nconstrued as “thin layers” that are schematized\nas having fewer dimensions than the wholes to which they apply. \n\nArguably, this conceptual tension between boundaries understood as\nlower-dimensional entities and boundaries understood as thin layers\nreflects an irreducible ambiguity in ordinary speech (Stroll 1979,\n1988).  And, arguably, it is only the first conception that gives rise\nto the puzzles outlined in the foregoing sections; bulky boundaries\ncan be treated as ordinary, extended parts of the bodies they bound. Yet\na general theory of boundaries should have something to say about the\nsecond conception as well — and more generally about the\ninteraction between the mathematical idealization associated with the\nformer conception and the physical, cognitive, and philosophical\nsignificance of the latter (Galton 2007). \n\nThe issue also relates to the question of whether there can be\nextended mereological simples (raised by van Inwagen 1981 and Lewis\n1991: 32, 76 and extensively discussed e.g. in Markosian 1998, Parsons\n2000, Simons 2004, Braddon-Mitchell and Miller 2006, and McDaniel\n2007, inter alia). For the characterization of boundaries as\nlower-dimensional extremities is compatible with the possibility that\na boundary's spatiotemporal extension transcend its mereological\nstructure. A pointy boundary, for instance, could be pointy in that it\nhas no proper parts, but that does not rule out that it be located at\nan extended region short of assuming that the mereological structure\nof a thing always matches perfectly that of its location (what Varzi\n2007:1018 calls “mirroring” and Shaffer 2009:138, Uzquiano\n2011 “harmony”). \n\nSo boundaries are, on the one hand, central to the common-sense\npicture of the world and yet, on the other, deeply problematic. We may\naccordingly distinguish two main sorts of theories, depending on\nwhether one is willing to take the problems at face value (realist\ntheories) or to bypass them altogether, treating boundaries as\nfictional abstractions of some sort (eliminativist theories). \n\nMost realist theories about boundaries, construed as lower-dimensional\nentities, share the view that such entities are ontological parasites:\npoints, lines, and surfaces cannot be separated and cannot exist in\nisolation from the entities they bound (pace Suárez,\nwho thought that God would be capable of such marvels;\nsee Disputation 40, V, 41). This view does justice to the\nintuition that boundaries, if real, are somewhat “less\nreal” than bulky entities, and as such it goes back to Aristotle\n(Metaphysics XI, 2, 1060b12–16) and has been defended e.g. by\nBoethius (Second Commentary I, xi, 14–21), revived by Abelard\n(Glosses on Porphyry, 8.1–4), and eventually endorsed by\nBrentano (1976) and his pupils (Chisholm 1984).  Realist theories may\ndiffer significantly, however, with regard to how such dependent,\nlower-dimensional entities relate to the extended entities they\nbound. Thus, with reference to the first puzzle of Section 1,\nlet A and B be any two extended entities separated\nby a common boundary (such as Maryland and Pennsylvania). Then we may\ndistinguish four main views (Varzi 1997): \n\nThese four views are mutually exclusive, but they need not be\nexhaustive and can be further articulated or integrated to address the\nissues raised by the other puzzles of Section 1. For example, with\nreference to the second puzzle (Section 1.2), Smith and Varzi (2000)\nconsider a double-barred theory that is of type (2) with respect to\nbona fide boundaries and of type (4) with respect to\nfiat boundaries (so there is no coincidence of real\nboundaries but merely of fiat articulations). Similarly, the\nindeterminacy hypothesis advocated by type-(2) theories can be\nregarded as being of a piece with the sort of indeterminacy that is\ninvolved in the phenomenon of vagueness (Section\n1.3). For fiat boundaries, for instance, a de dicto\naccount may be applied in both cases: statements about such boundaries\nare true iff they are super-true, i.e., true under every admissible\nway of precisifying the relevant fiat articulations (Varzi\n2001 and references therein). There are other options, too. For\ninstance, Hudson (2005, ch. 3) offers an account of boundaries that\npermits instances of each of (1), (2) and (3) (and without any\ndialethic implications). It is also possible to reject the\nmereotopological setting that leads to the taxonomy above and, with\nit, the need to choose among (1)–(4). See, e.g., Breysse and De Glas\n(2007) for a proposal in this spirit. \n\nEliminativist theories move from the idea that talk of boundaries\ninvolves some sort of abstraction — an idea that can be found\nalready in the medieval and modern debate on anti-indivisibilism\n(Zimmerman 1996a; Holden 2004) and that has recently become the focus\nof renewed attention in connection with the hypothesis that the\nuniverse might consist of “atomless gunk” (Lewis 1991:\n20), i.e., that either space and time or matter, or both, divide\nforever into smaller and smaller parts (Sider 1993, Zimmerman 1996b;\nHawthorne and Weatherson 2004; McDaniel 2006; Hudson 2007;\nJ. T. Russell 2008; Arntzenius 2008). What sort of abstraction would\nbe involved here? And how can one account for our ordinary and\nmathematical talk about boundaries if these are to be explained away\nas fictional abstractions? With special reference to the boundaries of\nspatio-temporal particulars, we may distinguish two main\napproaches. \n\nOne standard objection to type-(2) theories is that the abstractness\nof boundaries seems to run afoul of the abstractness of set-theoretic\nconstructions. One can see and paint the surface of a table, and one\ncan even see and paint an infinite series of ever thinner layers of\ntable-parts. But one cannot paint the set of these parts\n(unless of course this is simply another way of saying that the\nparts are painted). Indeed, Theodore de Laguna, one of the very\nfirst sponsors of Whitehead's method, remarked that the identification\nof points and other boundaries with classes of solids is open to\nserious misinterpretation: “Although we perceive solids, we perceive no\nabstractive sets of solids […] In accepting the abstractive set,\nwe are as veritably going beyond experience as in accepting the solid\nof zero-length” (de Laguna 1922: 460). \n\nA third option, alternative to both type-(1) and type-(2) theories,\nwould be an “operationalist” account of the sort advocated\nby Adams (1984, 1996), where the abstractive process by which boundary\nelements are derived from concrete observables is explained in terms\nof “operational tests”. Arguably, however, such an account\nis best regarded as a parallel story, one that offers an explanation\nof empirical knowledge concerning boundaries while remaining\nultimately neutral with regard to their ontological status. [What follows is a list of significant passages from the\nphilosophical literature. These should provide the reader with a\nuseful set of examples.] \n\n“A point is that which has no part. A line is breadthless\nlength.  The extremities of a line are points. […] A surface is\nthat which has length and breadth only. The extremities of a surface\nare lines. […] A boundary is that which is an extremity of\nanything.” [Euclid, Elements, Bk I, Dfs 1–3,\n5–6, 13 (1908: p. 153)] \n\n“We call a limit the last point [το\nεσχατον] of each thing, i.e.,\nthe first point beyond which it is not possible to find any part [of\nthe thing], and the first point within which every part [of the thing]\nis.” [Aristotle, Metaphysics V, 17, 1022a4–5 (1984:\n1613)] \n\n“[I]nasmuch as it is the same now that belongs to both the times\n[past and future], and it is possible for a thing to be in motion\nthroughout one time and to be at rest throughout the other, and that\nwhich is in motion or at rest for the whole of a time will be in\nmotion or at rest in any part of it in which it is of such a nature as\nto be in motion or at rest: it will follow that the same thing can at\nthe same time be at rest and in motion; for both the times have the\nsame extremity, viz. the now.” [Aristotle, Physics V,\n3, 234a35–234b4 (1984: 395)] \n\n“If we are to suppose lines or what comes after these (I mean\nthe primary surfaces) to be principles, these at least are not\nseparable substances, but sections and divisions — the former of\nsurfaces, the latter of bodies (while points are sections and\ndivisions of lines); and further they are limits of these same things;\nand all these are in other things and none is separable.”\n[Aristotle, Metaphysics XI, 2, 1060b12–16 (1984: 1675f)] \n\n“A line is something in a body. And what it is it owes to the\nbody. That is, it keeps its being through the body. This is explained\nas follows. If it is separated from the body, it does not subsist. Who\nby any sense faculty ever grasped a line separated from a body?”\n[Boethius, Second Commentary on Porphyry's Isagoge I, xi,\n14–21 (English translation  from Spade 1994: 23–24)] \n\n“There are two species of incorporeals. Some of them, such as\nGod and the soul, can endure in their incorporeality outside\nsensibles. But others, such as a line without subject body, are\nentirely unable to be outside the sensibles they are in.” [Peter\nAbelard, Glosses on Porphyry, 8.1–4 (English\ntranslation from Spade 1994: 26)] \n\n“[T]he spherical body does not touch the flat body primarily\nwith a part that is such that each of its parts touches the\nflat body. Therefore, it does not touch it primarily with some part\nthat is prior to all the other touching parts. Rather, any given\ntouching part is still such that a half of it does not touch\nimmediately, and a half of that half does not touch immediately, and\nso on ad infinitum.” [William of Ockham, Quodlibetal\nQuestions, I, q. 9, ad 2 (1991: 53)] \n\nPoints are “things completely indivisible”, lines are\n“things divisible only in one dimension”, and surfaces are\n“things divisible in two dimensions.” [Gregory of Rimini,\nCommentary of the Sentences II, d. 2, q. 2, ad 1\n(English translation  from Duhem 1985: 25–26)] \n\n“What is it […] that divides the atmosphere from the\nwater?  It is necessary that there should be a common boundary which\nis neither air nor water but is without substance, because a body\ninterposed between two bodies prevents their contact, and this does\nnot happen in water with air. […] Therefore a surface is the\ncommon boundary of two bodies which are not continuous, and does not\nform part of either one or the other, for if the surface formed part\nof it, it would have divisible bulk, whereas, however, it is not\ndivisible and nothingness divides these bodies the one from the\nother.” [Leonardo da Vinci, Notebooks (1938:\n75–76)] \n\n“Real contact occurs in some entity which truly and formally\nexists in things; for the contact itself is real, and properly and\nformally exists in reality; therefore it occurs in some real entity\nwhich formally exists in the thing; and yet it occurs in an\nindivisible thing; therefore such an indivisible entity exists\nformally in the thing itself.” [Francisco\nSuárez, Metaphysical Disputations 40, V, §19\n(English translation  from Zimmerman 1996a: 160)] \n\n“[I]t could plausibly be said that a line can be conserved by\nGod without a limiting point, and a surface without a line, and a body\nwithout a surface.” [Francisco Suárez, Metaphysical\nDisputations 40, V, §41 (English translation  by Robert Pasnau)] \n\n“The other difficulty is that these indivisibles cannot be\nadmitted in the case of forms or qualities that are extended in matter\nor quantity, because otherwise it would follow that two qualities that\nare maximal contraries with respect to something real and positive\nbelonging to them would be conjoined at the same time in the same\nindivisible subject, which involves an absurdity. The inference is\nclear, for suppose that, in the continuous surface of a wall, one half\nis maximally white and the other half is maximally black, and those\nqualities each have their own indivisible boundaries\n[termini] by which they are contained and limited. It will\nthen be necessary that, from that part in virtue of which they are\ncontiguous, they each have their own boundaries inhering at the same\ntime in the same line connecting [continuanti] the\nquantitative surface. […] From this it further happens that in\nthe same indivisible boundary of matter there would be, at the same,\ntime two specific substantial forms with respect to something that is\nindivisible in extension.” [Francisco\nSuárez, Metaphysical Disputations 40, V, §58\n(English translation  by Robert Pasnau)] \n\n“[B]y superficies we do not here mean any portion of the\nsurrounding body, but merely the extremity which is between the\nsurrounded body and that surrounded, which is but a mode; or\n[…] we mean the common surface which is a surface that is not a\npart of one body rather than the other, and that is always considered\nthe same, so long as it retains the same magnitude and figure.”\n[René Descartes, Principles of Philosophy, Part II,\nPrinciple 15 (1911: 261)] \n\n“The schoolmen were so sensible of the force of this\nargument, that some of them maintained, that nature has mixed among\nthose particles of matter, which are divisible in infinitum,\na number of mathematical points, in order to give a termination to\nbodies; and others eluded the force of this reasoning by a heap of\nunintelligible cavils and distinctions. Both these adversaries equally\nyield the victory. […] Thus it appears, that the definitions of\nmathematics destroy the pretended demonstrations; and that if we have\nthe idea of indivisible points, lines and surfaces conformable to the\ndefinition, their existence is certainly possible: but if we have no\nsuch idea, 'tis impossible we can ever conceive the termination of any\nfigure; without which conception there can be no geometrical\ndemonstration.” [David Hume, A Treatise of Human\nNature, I-ii-4 (1941: 44)] \n\n“In all bounds there is something positive (e.g., a surface is\nthe boundary of corporeal space, and is therefore itself a space, a\nline is a space, which is the boundary of the surface, a point the\nboundary of the line, but yet always a place in space), whereas limits\ncontain mere negations.” [Immanuel Kant, Prolegomena to Any\nFuture Metaphysics, §57 (1977: 94)] \n\n“I define the limit of a body as the aggregate of all the\nextreme [äusserst] ether-atoms which still\nbelong to it. […] A closer consideration further shows\nthat many bodies are at certain places altogether devoid of limiting\natoms; none of their atoms can be described as the extreme\nones among those which still belong to it and would accompany it if it\nstarted to move. [Two bodies are in contact] when the extreme atoms of\nthe one, […] together with certain atoms of the other, form a\ncontinuous extension.” [Bernard Bolzano Paradoxes of the\nInfinite, § 66 (1851: 167–168)] \n\n“One of the two lines into which the line would be split upon\ndivision would […] have an end point, but the other no\nbeginning point. This inference has been quite correctly drawn by\nBolzano, who was led thereby to his monstruous doctrine that there\nwould exist bodies with and without surfaces, the one class containing\njust so many as the other, because contact would be possible only\nbetween a body with a surface and another without. He ought, rather,\nto have had his attention drawn by such consequences to the fact that\nthe whole conception of the line and of other continua as sets of\npoints runs counter to the concept of contact and thereby abolishes\nprecisely what makes up the essence of the continuum.” [Franz\nBrentano, ‘Nativistic, Empiricist, and Anoetistic Theories of\nour Presentation of Space’ (1976: 146)] \n\n“If a red surface and a blue surface are in contact with each\nother, then a red and a blue line coincide.” [Franz Brentano,\n‘On What Is Continuous’ (1976: 41)] \n\n“One calls the equator an imaginary line, but it would be wrong\nto call it a line that has merely been thought up. It was not created\nby thought as the result of a psychological process, but is only\napprehended or grasped by thought. If its being apprehended were a\nmatter of its coming into being, then we could not say anything\npositive about the equator for any time prior to this supposed coming\ninto being.” [Gottlob Frege, The Foundations of\nArithmetic § 26 (1884: 35)] \n\n“A definition of a concept (of a possible predicate) must\n[…] unambiguously determine, as regards any object, whether or\nnot it falls under the concept (whether or not the predicate is truly\nassertible of it). […] We may express this metaphorically as\nfollows: the concept must have a sharp boundary. To a concept without\nsharp boundary there would correspond an area that had not a sharp\nboundary-line all around, but in places just vaguely faded away into\nthe background. […] The law of the excluded middle is really\njust another form of the requirement that the concept should have a\nsharp boundary.” [Gottlob Frege, The Fundamental Laws of\nArithmetic, Vol. II, §56 (1903: 159)] \n\n“A drop of ink has fallen upon the paper and I have walled it\nround. Now every point of the area within the walls is either black or\nwhite; and no point is both black and white. That is plain. The black\nis, however, all in one spot or blot; it is within bounds. There is a\nline of demarcation between the black and the white. Now I ask about\nthe points of this line, are they black or white? Why one more than\nthe other? Are they (A) both black and white or (B) neither black nor\nwhite? Why A more than B, or B more than A? […] The logical\nconclusion […] is that the points of the boundary do not\nexist.” [Charles S. Peirce, ‘The Logic of Quantity’\n(1893: 7.127)] \n\n“[We must distinguish between the category of Natural Frontiers\nand] the category of Artificial Frontiers, by which are meant those\nboundary lines which, not being dependent upon natural features of the\nearth's surface for their selection, have been artificially or\narbitrarily created by man.” [George Nathaniel\nCurzon, Frontiers (1907: 12)]. \n\n“The limits [Grenzen] of my language mean the limits of\nmy world.” [Ludwig Wittgenstein, Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus, 5.6] \n\n“An indefinite boundary is not really a boundary at all.”\n[Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations, I,\n§99 (1953: 45e)] \n\n“It is unnatural to draw a conceptual boundary line where there\nis not some special justification for it, where similarities would\nconstantly draw us across the arbitrarily drawn line.” [Ludwig\nWittgenstein, Remarks on the Philosophy of Psychology, II,\n§626 (1980: 108e)] \n\n“I hold it to be quite certain that I do not directly\nperceive my hand; and that when I am said (as I may be\ncorrectly said) to ‘perceive’ it, that I\n‘perceive’ it means that I perceive (in a different and\nmore fundamental sense) something which is (in a suitable sense)\nrepresentative of it, namely, a certain part of its surface.”\n[G. E. Moore, ‘A Defence of Common Sense’ (1925: 217)] \n\n“‘Surface,’ it is true, is a substantive in grammar;\nbut it is not the name of a particular existent, but of an\nattribute.” [H. H. Price, Perception (1932: 106)] \n\n“If we can give a definition of points which will make them\nfulfil a certain pair of conditions, it will not matter though points\nin themselves should turn out to be entities of a very different kind\nfrom what we had supposed them to be. The two conditions are (i) that\npoints must have to each other the kind of relations which geometry\ndemands; and (ii) that points must have to finite areas and volumes\nsuch a relation that a reasonable sense can be given to the statement\nthat such areas and volumes can be exhaustively analysed into sets of\npoints.” [C. D. Broad, Scientific Thought (1959:\n39)] \n\n“It is […] wrong to imply that everything has a surface.\nWhere and what exactly is the surface of a cat?” [John\nL. Austin,\nSense and Sensibilia (1962: 100)] \n\n“The surface is where most of the action is. The surface is where\nlight is reflected or absorbed, not the interior of the substance. The\nsurface is what touches the animal, not the interior. The surface is\nwhere chemical reactions mostly take place. The surface is where\nvaporization or diffusion of substances into the medium occurs. And the\nsurface is where vibrations of the substance are transmitted into the\nmedium.” [J. J. Gibson, The Ecological Approach to Visual\nPerception (1979: 23)] \n\n“The picture of reality as an amorphous lump, not yet\narticulated into discrete objects, thus proves to be a correct one, so\nlong as we make the right use of it […] Such a picture corrects\nthe naïve conception […] [that] presupposes that the world\npresents itself to us already dissected into discrete objects, which\nwe know how to recognize when we encounter them again, in advance of\nour acquiring any grasp of language at all.” (Michael\nDummett, Frege. Philosophy of Language (1973: 577)] \n\n“Now as we thus make constellations by picking out and putting\ntogether certain stars rather than others, so we make stars by drawing\ncertain boundaries rather than others. Nothing dictates whether the\nskies shall be marked off into constellations or other objects. We\nhave to make what we find, be it the Great Dipper, Sirius, food, fuel,\nor a stereo system.” [Nelson Goodman, ‘Notes on the\nWell-Made World’ (1983: 104)] \n\n“If the continuous object is cut in half, then does the one\nboundary [that demarcates two adjacent parts] become two boundaries,\none thing thus becoming two things? […] But how can one thing\n— even if it is only a boundary — become two things? And\ndoes this mean that when two things become continuous, then two things\nthat had been diverse become identical with each other, two\nthings thus becoming one thing?” [Roderick Chisholm,\n‘Boundaries as Dependent Particulars’ (1984: 88)] \n\n“The reason why it's vague where the outback begins is not that\nthere's this thing, the outback, with imprecise borders; rather there\nare many things, with different borders, and nobody has been fool\nenough to try to enforce a choice of one of them as the official\nreferent of the word ‘outback’.” [David K. Lewis, The\nPlurality of Worlds (1986: 212)] \n\n“There is no line which sharply divides the matter composing [Mount]\nEverest from the matter outside it. Everest's boundaries are fuzzy.\nSome molecules are inside Everest and some molecules outside. But some\nhave an indefinite status: there is no objective, determinate fact of\nthe matter about whether they are inside or outside.” [Michael Tye,\n‘Vague Objects’ (1990: 535)] \n\n“A vague concept is boundaryless in that no boundary marks the\nthings which fall under it from the things which do not, and no\nboundary marks the things which definitely fall under it from the\nthings which do not definitely do so; and so on. Manifestations are\nthe unwillingness of knowing subjects to draw any such boundaries, the\ncognitive impossibility of identifying such boundaries, and the\nneedlessness and even disutility of such boundaries.” [Mark\nSainsbury, ‘Concepts without Boundaries’ (1990: 257)] \n\n“The world is capable of being cut up in so many ways, and\nwhenever we consider such a cut (some principle of individuation), we\nare considering the world cut that way, i.e., so articulated. An\narticulation will specify both actual conditions which must be met for\nsomething to be (an) F, and identity conditions for tracing Fs through\nspace, time, and possible worlds. If there are portions of the world\nwhich meet the actual conditions, then there are Fs.” [Alan\nSidelle, ‘Rigidity, Ontology, and Semantic Structure’\n(1992: 172)]","contact.mail":"achille.varzi@columbia.edu","contact.domain":"columbia.edu"}]
