The notion that a word, once it has\nbeen imposed to signify, carries with it all of its syntactical modes,\nor possible combinations with other words, had been around since the\ntwelfth century. What the Modistae did was to posit the\norigins of the modi significandi in terms of parallel\ntheories of modi intelligendi (modes of understanding) and\nmodi essendi (modes of being). The result was a curious\namalgam of philosophy, grammar, and linguistics. Thomas of Erfurt's\nDe modis significandi became the standard Modist textbook in\nthe fourteenth century, though it has since enjoyed even greater fame\nlater thanks to its misidentification as a work of Duns Scotus. The\ntext appeared in early printed editions of Scotus's Opera\nOmnia, where it was read and commented upon by later figures such\nas Charles S. Peirce and Martin Heidegger, whose 1916 doctoral thesis,\nDie Kategorien- und Bedeutungslehre des Duns Scotus, should\nhave been titled, Die Kategorienlehre des Duns Scotus und die\nBedeutungslehre des Thomas von Erfurt.\n\n\n\nAlmost nothing is known about the life of Thomas of Erfurt except\nthat he was active as a teacher and philosopher in the first quarter of\nthe fourteenth\n century.[1]\n Presumably, he came from the city of Erfurt\nin present-day Germany. His work shows the influence of the Paris\nArts Masters Radulphus Brito (ca. 1270–1320) and Siger of Courtrai (ca.\n1280–1341), which suggests that he was educated and perhaps also taught\nat the University of\n Paris.[2]\n Later documents associate him with the\nschool of St. Severus and the Schottenkloster of St. Jacob at\n Erfurt.[3]\n His most famous grammatical text, De\nmodis significandi (On the Modes of Signifying) was known by 1310\nand was already being commented upon by 1324. It is possible that he\nreturned to Paris a number of times over the course of his academic\ncareer, although there are no records attesting to this. \n\nSome copies of De modis significandi attribute the work to\nan early fourteenth-century English cleric named Thomas of Occam,\nbut scholars have been skeptical about this because it occurs in just a\nhandful fifteenth-century\n manuscripts.[4]\n The vast majority of the manuscript evidence, and all of the earliest\nwitnesses, refer to its author as Thomas of Erfurt. \n\nSix works have been attributed to Thomas of Erfurt. In addition to\nthe aforementioned grammatical treatise, whose full title is\nTractatus de modis significandi seu Grammatica speculativa\n(ed. Bursill-Hall\n 1972),[5]\n there are four short expositiones,\nor literal commentaries: on Porphyry's Isagoge, Aristotle's\nCategories, Aristotle's De interpretatione, and the\nanonymous Liber sex principiorum (Book of Six Principles).\nFinally, there is a very brief work of mnemonic verses for teaching\ngrammar to schoolboys, Commentarius in carmen ‘Fundamentum\npuerorum’ (ed. Gansiniec 1960), although its editor believes\nthat it is actually an anonymous abridgement of De modis\nsignificandi. In any case, Thomas's entire reputation derives from\nDe modis significandi, which remains his only work to\nhave been studied in any detail. \n\nDe modis significandi proved to be so popular that it\nbecame the standard (and later, the representative) text for the Modist\ntradition (see next section), surviving in over 40 fourteenth-\nand fifteenth-century manuscripts. A printed edition appeared in\nthe late fifteenth century that was reprinted a remarkable 11\ntimes before its ‘definitive’ reprinting in Luke Wadding's\n1639 edition of the complete works of Duns\n Scotus.[6] \n\nThomas of Erfurt belonged to an interesting though somewhat obscure\ngroup of late thirteenth- and early fourteenth-century philosophers\nknown as the speculative grammarians or Modistae.  The term\n‘speculative grammarian’ is ambiguous because it is also\nused by historians of medieval philosophy to refer to twelfth-century\nParisian grammar masters such as William of Conches, Peter Helias, and\nRalph of Beauvais, who systematically revised the ancient grammars of\nDonatus and Priscian — textbooks used to teach Latin to schoolboys \n— to produce a universal\n semantics.[7]\n The two groups are related, as it turns out, since these latter-day\ngrammarians adopted many of the theories as well as the universalizing\ntendencies of their twelfth-century predecessors.  Foremost among them\nwas the theory of the modi significandi, or modes of\nsignifying. The term ‘Modistae’ or\n‘Modist’ properly refers to the later group. \n\nThere was already a grammatical concept of the modi\nsignificandi by the time the first Modistae, Martin of\nDacia and Boethius of Dacia, appeared in Paris sometime before\n 1270.[8]\n Originally, the idea referred to the different ways in which a word\nor expression (dictio) is able to signify something. Words\nthemselves are the product of a primary act of imposition by which a\nparticular utterance is connected to some thing or property of a\nthing, the utterance providing the matter, which is said to be\n‘informed’ by the act of imposition.  The word acquires\nits modi significandi through a second act of imposition\nencoding all of the general syntactic roles it can play in connection\nwith other words and expressions, such as the various parts of speech it\ncan fulfill (e.g., noun, verb, adverb) and the grammatical forms of\nthese parts (e.g., the gender, number, and case of nouns; the tense\nand mood of verbs). These modes are said to cause the various lexical\nforms exhibited by the word in spoken and written languages.  Thus,\nLatin uses the word ‘canis’ to signify what English\nspeakers mean by ‘dog’, but the same modes of signifying\ndetermine their function as singular and as\n nouns.[9]\n We might think of modi significandi metaphorically as hooks\nor fasteners on a word because they reflect its potential for\ncombination with other words in propositions and other grammatically\nwell-formed constructions. \n\nIt is easy to see how such an account of meaning could lead to a\nbona fide theory of grammar, what Jan Pinborg called\n“the first systematic syntax developed in western\n linguistics”.[10]\n Indeed, speculative grammarians of both\nperiods have attracted the attention of linguists and philosophers\nalike.[11]\n But the stakes were higher for the\nModistae because the influx of Aristotle's writings on\nmetaphysics and natural philosophy in the late twelfth and\nearly thirteenth centuries forced everyone to think in terms of a\nnew paradigm of knowledge. Could grammar be reconceived as the science of\nlanguage (scientia sermocinalis)? The question here was\nwhether grammar could count as an Aristotelian speculative science,\ni.e., whether it is demonstrative in the sense of being a\nknowledge-producing activity ordained by a single subject whose\nprinciples are universal and\n necessary.[12]\n Concerns of this sort clearly underlie Boethius of Dacia's appraisal\nof traditional grammar: \n\nThomas of Erfurt indicates in the opening lines of De modis\nsignificativis that he aims to be one of these teachers: \n\nFor Modistae such as Boethius of Dacia and Thomas of\nErfurt, the proper subject of grammar is well-formed, significant\nspeech (sermo congrue significativus), the principles of which\nare expressed in the modi significandi. \n\nBut this is where things get interesting, for the Modistae\nalso understood the theory of the modi significandi to involve\nclaims about the nature of thought and reality. The problem with\nPriscian, as twelfth-century grammarians had pointed out, is\nthat he said nothing about what causes the different parts of speech.\nHence the need for a theory of the modi significandi. But the\nModistae saw that this could only be part of the answer, for\ngrammar is a linguistic phenomenon, and linguistic phenomena must have\na cause within the natural order of things. Therefore, to complete the\nexplanation, they argued that the formal structure of the modi\nsignificandi owes its existence to modi intelligendi, or\nmodes of understanding, which in turn are caused by modi\nessendi, or the modes of being a thing can exhibit outside the\nmind. \n\nThe heart of the Modist project is the assumption that there is a\ntriadic or parallel relationship between word, concept, and thing.\nMeaning is based proximately on understanding but ultimately on being.\nAccording to Thomas of Erfurt: \n\nNote the phrase, “since such notions or modes of signifying\nare not fictions.” The modi significandi could not play\nany causal role in determining the parts of speech, nor the\ncorresponding modi intelligendi in determining the modi\nsignificandi, nor the modi essendi in determining the\nmodi intelligendi, unless they all actually exist. Here the\nModistae drew on the Aristotelian idea that although spoken\nsounds and written marks differ from language to language, “what\nthese are in the first place signs of — affections of the soul — are\nthe same for all; and what these affections are likenesses of — actual\nthings — are also the same” (De interpretatione\n 1.16a3–9).[14]\n Likewise, the ordering of modes was\nintended to replicate the ordering of disciplines in an Aristotelian\nspeculative science: just as psychology, the study of moving things\nqua animate, is subordinate to physics, the study of things\nqua moving, and physics is subordinate to metaphysics, the\nstudy of things qua existing, so the principles of grammar\n(modi significandi) are derived from mental acts of signifying\n(modi intelligendi), which reflect the way things really are\n(modi essendi). \n\nTidy conceptual schemes tend to become less so when confronted with\nthe facts, and the Modistae spent a great deal of time trying\nto explain recalcitrant linguistic data. After sketching the origins\nof the modi significandi in the first chapters of his\ntreatise, Thomas immediately considers a few objections: how can\n‘goddess [dea]’ be signified with a feminine\nnoun, which connotes passivity? Answer: a mode of signifying need not\nalways be drawn from the thing signified, for sometimes it “can\nbe taken from the property of the thing of another utterance;”\nthus, when we say ‘in God’, we do not mean to attribute\npassivity to God, who suffers not, but only to “imagine him as\nif being affected by our prayers.” When we use a passive or\nfeminine mode of signifying in relation to God, what we are really\ndoing is signifying our own passive or feminine conception of some\nother thing that is a genuine recipient, i.e.,\nsomething that does correspond to a determinate mode of being\nqua recipient, and then imposing the same word to signify\nGod.  In the same way, we impose names on things we cannot sense via\nthe properties of sensible things, thereby attributing “active\nmodes of signifying to their names” (DMS 2.5;\nBursill-Hall: 4). \n\nBut what about words signifying fictions, such as\n‘chimera’, or privations, such as ‘blindness’?\nThese do not correspond to any mode of being, active or passive, since\nthey signify nothing (i.e., no thing). According to Thomas, the active\nmodes of signifying chimeras “are taken from the parts from which\nwe imagine a chimera to be composed, which [fiction] we imagine from\nthe head of a lion, the tail of a dragon, etc” (DMS\n2.5; Bursill-Hall: 4). Names of privations, on the other hand,\n“designate the modes of understanding of privations, which are\ntheir modes of being, through their own active modes of signifying\nabout privations”. The idea here is that ‘blindness’\ncorresponds to our positive concept of sight qua absent, which\nenjoys a positive modus essendi in our intellects. Thus,\n“although privations are not positive beings outside the soul,\nthey are nevertheless positive beings in the soul … and since the\nunderstanding of them is their being, therefore, their mode of\nunderstanding would be their mode of being” (DMS 2.6;\nBursill-Hall: 4). Blindness outside the soul cannot cause any\nconception of itself per se, since blindness per se\ndoes not exist, and what does not exist cannot be the cause of\nanything. Accordingly, when we say, ‘Homer was a blind\nman,’ the word ‘blind’ actively signifies the passive\nmode of understanding something as being without sight, and owes its\nsemantic function to the way its corresponding concept is understood.\nIn the case of concepts that are neither fictions nor privations, these\nmodes of understanding are further determined by their corresponding\nmodes of being, i.e., by actual substances and properties outside the\nsoul. \n\nFor the Modistae, then, the words ‘chimera’ and\n‘horse’ differ, but only in terms of the complexity of\ntheir underlying modes. Thomas follows Siger of Courtrai in\ndistinguishing between active and passive modi\nsignificandi/modi intelligendi to explain the difference\nbetween the act of signifying/understanding (materially construed as a\nproperty of the utterance/concept) and the object signified/understood\n(materially construed as a property of the thing signified/understood).\nThe fact that nothing answers to the name ‘chimera’ simply\ndoes not matter. Modism was a theory about meaning\n(significatio) of a word as opposed to its reference\n(suppositio), and reference was regarded as something\ndetermined by logicians. Besides, if grammatical truths are\nuniversal and necessary — i.e., if there really is a science of\ngrammar — then they cannot be altered by the fact that there are no\nchimeras. It is the assumption that some palpable phenomenon must\nunderlie every grammatical truth, causing it to be the way it is, which\nguides Thomas's discussion in the remainder of the treatise, which soon\nmoves on to more practical matters such as the different parts of\nspeech (‘Etymologia’) and their syntax\n(‘Diasynthetica’). Included in the latter are the\nconcepts of constructio (the syntactic joining of one word to\nanother), congruitas (the proper formation of such\nconstructions), and perfectio (the proper formation of\ncomplete expressions). \n\nModist explanations of semantic phenomena tended to be extremely\ncomplicated. Indeed, if we consider the manifold ways in which a word\ncan be a signifier together with its potential for combination with\nother words in expressions, there could be infinitely many modi\nsignificandi — a proliferation of modes repeated all over again\nat the level of modi intelligendi. Philosophers today think of\nMeinong's theory of objects as a paradigm of ontological\nincontinence. These philosophers have never met the Modistae,\nwho would make even Meinong seem parsimonious. But in a way this is\nunfair, of course, since the Modistae were not ontologists and\nhad no interest in the metaphysical consequences of their theories.\nThey were first and foremost concerned with the phenomenon of\nlinguistic meaning, and invoked whatever entities they felt could best\nexplain what they observed. \n\nThomas's De modis significandi was the last work to develop\nModist doctrine to any significant\n degree.[15]\n Its clarity and relative brevity led to its adoption as the standard\nModist text in medieval universities, replacing the earlier Modi\nsignificandi of Martin of Dacia. But by 1330 and for reasons that\nremain unclear, Modism had completely disappeared from Paris, pushed\naside by the more powerful and comprehensive approach of the\nSummulae de dialectica of John Buridan\n(ca.\n 1300–1361).[16]\n Modism was never able to overcome certain difficulties, such as its\nrefusal to recognize extra-linguistic context, as a result of which it\ncould not explain how meaning can be communicated via incongruous or\nimperfect\n expressions.[17]\n But the most likely reason for its demise\nwas that it no longer provided satisfying explanations of the phenomena\nit was supposed to explain. The one thing it could do, provide an\naccount of the syntax of Latin grammar, could be achieved more\neconomically by other means. In addition, the theory became absurdly\ncomplicated in order to save the phenomena of the modi\nsignificandi, suggesting that the modi finally collapsed\nunder their own weight, like so many Ptolemaic epicycles. \n\nThomas of Erfurt's De modis significandi has enjoyed more\nattention than it might otherwise have received thanks to its early\nmisidentification as a work of Duns\n Scotus.[18]\n As a result, it was printed along with authentic works on logic in\nvolume 1 of Luke Wadding's seventeenth-century edition of the\nOpera Omnia of Duns Scotus (Lyons 1639), and again in the\nnineteenth-century reprint of Wadding by Juan-Luis Vivès (Paris\n 1891).[19]\n Until recently, the Wadding-Vivès edition was the\ndefinitive source for the works of Scotus, so anyone consulting\nit would have associated De modis significandi with\n him.[20]\nComplicating the story somewhat is the fact that Scotus was\ninfluenced by Modism early in his career, though this was probably due\nto his exposure to Modist authors such as Simon of Faversham and Andrew\nof Cornwall.[21]\n It is unlikely that he was influenced by Thomas of Erfurt, because De modis significandi did not circulate widely until after Scotus's death. \n\nOne of the many later figures to have unwittingly admired Thomas was\nthe American philosopher, Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914), who\nregarded Duns Scotus as a fellow traveler in metaphysics and whose own\nsemiotic theory resembles the Modist program in certain\n respects.[22]\n Peirce quotes verbatim the first\nsix chapters of De modis significandis in an 1869 lecture\ncomparing the views of (what he took to be) Duns Scotus and William of\nOckham on names and signification. But the lecture is introductory in\ncharacter, leaving it uncertain whether Peirce fully appreciated what\nwas at stake in Modistic grammar, rather than viewing it, say, as some\nsort of linguistic addendum to Scotus's\n metaphysics.[23] \n\nAnother figure so influenced was Martin Heidegger, whose\nHabilitationsschrift was published in 1916 under the title,\nDie Kategorien- und Bedeutungslehre des Duns Scotus. This\nbook has not been much studied by Heidegger scholars, which is a pity\nbecause it is really about Heidegger's own project of advancing the\nHusserlian notion of a priori grammar.  A work of historical\nscholarship it is not. In what now seems a classic understatement, the\nhistorian of medieval philosophy Martin Grabmann wrote of this book in\n1926, “Martin Heidegger has demonstrated the continuity of the\nGrammatica speculativa hitherto attributed to Duns Scotus\nwith the terminology and overall intellectual outlook of Husserl, so\nthat the structure and distinctiveness of the medieval original is\nsomewhat\n obscured”.[24]\n In his defense, Heidegger never pretends\nto be doing history of philosophy in Die Kategorien- und\nBedeutungslehre des Duns Scotus. On the contrary, he states at the\nbeginning of Part II that he is mostly interested in exploring the\nimplications of De modis significandi for the broader theory\nof meaning, and that he is following scholarly consensus in attributing\nit to Duns\n Scotus.[25] \n\nIn 1922, however, Grabmann conclusively demonstrated that it was\nThomas of Erfurt who wrote De modis significandi, not Duns\n Scotus.[26]\n So the claim that Heidegger wrote his Habilitationsschrift\non Duns Scotus is only partly true. The first half, die\nKategorienlehre, is correctly addressed to Scotus's theory\nof the categories as developed in his authentic commentaries on\nPorphyry's Isagoge, and Aristotle's Categories and\nDe sophisticis elenchis. But the second half, die\nBedeutungslehre, is based almost entirely on Thomas of\n Erfurt.[27] \n\nFor more recent influence, we need look no further than Jacques\nDerrida, who mentions Thomas of Erfurt (this time dressed as himself) in\nconnection with the old Peircean idea that logic is a branch of\nsemiotics: “As in Husserl (but the analogy, although it is most\nthought-provoking, would stop there and one must apply it carefully),\nthe lowest level, the foundation of the possibility of logic (or\nsemiotics) corresponds to the project of the Grammatica\nspeculativa of Thomas d'Erfurt, falsely attributed to Duns\n Scotus”.[28]\n What impresses Derrida is not so much the reduction of logic to\ngrammar as the deconstructive potential of Husserl's phenomenology of\nsigns. The idea of deconstructing the science of language would have\nstruck Thomas as absurd, of course, though he probably would have felt\nsome affinity with the highly variegated notion of the sign in modern\nsemiotics.
