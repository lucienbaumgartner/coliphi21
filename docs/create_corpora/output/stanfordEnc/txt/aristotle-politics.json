Along with his teacher Plato, Aristotle is\ngenerally regarded as one of the most influential ancient thinkers in\na number of philosophical fields, including political theory.\nAristotle was born in Stagira in northern Greece, and his father was a\ncourt physician to the king of Macedon. As a young man he studied in\nPlato's Academy in Athens. After Plato's death he left Athens to\nconduct philosophical and biological research in Asia Minor and\nLesbos, and he was then invited by King Philip II of Macedon to tutor\nhis young son, Alexander the Great. Soon after Alexander succeeded his\nfather, consolidated the conquest of the Greek city-states, and\nlaunched the invasion of the Persian Empire. Aristotle returned as a\nresident alien to Athens, and was a close friend of Antipater, the\nMacedonian viceroy. At this time (335–323 BCE) he wrote, or at\nleast worked on, some of his major treatises, including the\nPolitics. When Alexander died suddenly, Aristotle had to flee\nfrom Athens because of his Macedonian connections, and he died soon\nafter. Aristotle's life seems to have influenced his political thought\nin various ways: his interest in biology seems to be expressed in the\nnaturalism of his politics; his interest in comparative politics and\nhis sympathies for democracy as well as monarchy may have been\nencouraged by his travels and experience of diverse political systems;\nhe criticizes harshly, while borrowing extensively, from Plato's\nRepublic, Statesman, and Laws; and his own\nPolitics is intended to guide rulers and statesmen,\nreflecting the high political circles in which he moved. \n\nThe modern word ‘political’ derives from the Greek\npolitikos, ‘of, or pertaining to, the polis’.\n(The Greek term polis will be translated here as\n‘city-state’. It is also translated as ‘city’\nor ‘polis’, or simply anglicized as ‘polis’.\nCity-states like Athens and Sparta were relatively small and cohesive\nunits, in which political, religious, and cultural concerns were\nintertwined. The extent of their similarity to modern nation-states is\ncontroversial.) Aristotle's word for ‘politics’ is\npolitikê, which is short for politikê\nepistêmê or ‘political science’. It\nbelongs to one of the three main branches of science, which Aristotle\ndistinguishes by their ends or objects. Contemplative science\n(including physics and metaphysics) is concerned with truth or\nknowledge for its own sake; practical science with good action; and\nproductive science with making useful or beautiful objects\n(Top. VI.6.145a14–16, Met. VI.1.1025b24,\nXI.7.1064a16–19, EN VI.2.1139a26–8). Politics is\na practical science, since it is concerned with the noble action or\nhappiness of the citizens (although it resembles a productive science\nin that it seeks to create, preserve, and reform political systems).\nAristotle thus understands politics as a normative or prescriptive\ndiscipline rather than as a purely empirical or descriptive inquiry.\n \nIn the Nicomachean Ethics Aristotle describes his subject\nmatter as ‘political science’, which he characterizes as\nthe most authoritative science. It prescribes which sciences are to be\nstudied in the city-state, and the others — such as military\nscience, household management, and rhetoric — fall under its\nauthority. Since it governs the other practical sciences, their ends\nserve as means to its end, which is nothing less than the human good.\n“Even if the end is the same for an individual and for a\ncity-state, that of the city-state seems at any rate greater and more\ncomplete to attain and preserve. For although it is worthy to attain\nit for only an individual, it is nobler and more divine to do so for a\nnation or city-state” (EN I.2.1094b7-10). Aristotle's\npolitical science thus encompasses the two fields which modern\nphilosophers distinguish as ethics and political philosophy. (See the\nentry on\n Aristotle's ethics.)\n Political philosophy in the narrow sense is roughly speaking the\nsubject of his treatise called the Politics. For a further\ndiscussion of this topic, see the following supplementary\ndocument: \nPolitical science studies the tasks of the politician or statesman\n(politikos), in much the way that medical science concerns\nthe work of the physician (see Politics IV.1). It is, in\nfact, the body of knowledge that such practitioners, if truly expert,\nwill also wield in pursuing their tasks. The most important task for\nthe politician is, in the role of lawgiver\n(nomothetês), to frame the appropriate constitution for\nthe city-state. This involves enduring laws, customs, and institutions\n(including a system of moral education) for the citizens. Once the\nconstitution is in place, the politician needs to take the appropriate\nmeasures to maintain it, to introduce reforms when he finds them\nnecessary, and to prevent developments which might subvert the\npolitical system. This is the province of legislative science, which\nAristotle regards as more important than politics as exercised in\neveryday political activity such as the passing of decrees (see\nEN VI.8).  \nAristotle frequently compares the politician to a craftsman. The\nanalogy is imprecise because politics, in the strict sense of\nlegislative science, is a form of practical knowledge, while a craft\nlike architecture or medicine is a form of productive knowledge.\nHowever, the comparison is valid to the extent that the politician\nproduces, operates, maintains a legal system according to universal\nprinciples (EN VI.8 and X.9). In order to appreciate this\nanalogy it is helpful to observe that Aristotle explains the\nproduction of an artifact in terms of four causes: the material,\nformal, efficient, and final causes (Phys. II.3 and\nMet. A.2). For example, clay (material cause) is molded into\na vase shape (formal cause) by a potter (efficient or moving cause) so\nthat it can contain liquid (final cause). (For discussion of the four\ncauses see the entry on\n Aristotle's physics.) \nOne can also explain the existence of the city-state in terms of the\nfour causes. It is a kind of community (koinônia), that\nis, a collection of parts having some functions and interests in\ncommon (Pol. II.1.1261a18, III.1.1275b20). Hence, it is made\nup of parts, which Aristotle describes in various ways in different\ncontexts: as households, or economic classes (e.g., the rich and the\npoor), or demes (i.e., local political units). But, ultimately, the\ncity-state is composed of individual citizens (see\nIII.1.1274a38–41), who, along with natural resources, are the\n“material” or “equipment” out of which the\ncity-state is fashioned (see VII.14.1325b38-41). \nThe formal cause of the city-state is its constitution\n(politeia). Aristotle defines the constitution as “a\ncertain ordering of the inhabitants of the city-state”\n(III.1.1274b32-41). He also speaks of the constitution of a community\nas “the form of the compound” and argues that whether the\ncommunity is the same over time depends on whether it has the same\nconstitution (III.3.1276b1–11). The constitution is not a\nwritten document, but an immanent organizing principle, analogous to\nthe soul of an organism. Hence, the constitution is also “the\nway of life” of the citizens (IV.11.1295a40-b1, VII.8.1328b1-2).\nHere the citizens are that minority of the resident population who\npossess full political rights (III.1.1275b17–20). \nThe existence of the city-state also requires an efficient cause,\nnamely, its ruler. On Aristotle's view, a community of any sort can\npossess order only if it has a ruling element or authority. This\nruling principle is defined by the constitution, which sets criteria\nfor political offices, particularly the sovereign office\n(III.6.1278b8–10; cf. IV.1.1289a15–18). However, on a\ndeeper level, there must be an efficient cause to explain why a\ncity-state acquires its constitution in the first place. Aristotle\nstates that “the person who first established [the city-state]\nis the cause of very great benefits” (I.2.1253a30–1). This\nperson was evidently the lawgiver (nomothetês), someone\nlike Solon of Athens or Lycurgus of Sparta, who founded the\nconstitution. Aristotle compares the lawgiver, or the politician more\ngenerally, to a craftsman (dêmiourgos) like a weaver or\nshipbuilder, who fashions material into a finished product\n(II.12.1273b32–3, VII.4.1325b40–1365a5). \nThe notion of final cause dominates Aristotle's Politics from\nthe opening lines: \nSoon after, he states that the city-state comes into being for the\nsake of life but exists for the sake of the good life\n(2.1252b29–30). The theme that the good life or happiness is the\nproper end of the city-state recurs throughout the Politics\n(III.6.1278b17-24, 9.1280b39; VII.2.1325a7–10).  \nTo sum up, the city-state is a hylomorphic (i.e., matter-form)\ncompound of a particular population (i.e., citizen-body) in a given\nterritory (material cause) and a constitution (formal cause). The\nconstitution itself is fashioned by the lawgiver and is governed by\npoliticians, who are like craftsmen (efficient cause), and the\nconstitution defines the aim of the city-state (final cause,\nIV.1.1289a17–18). Aristotle's hylomorphic analysis has important\npractical implications for him: just as a craftsman should not try to\nimpose a form on materials for which it is unsuited (e.g. to build a\nhouse out of sand), the legislator should not lay down or change laws\nwhich are contrary to the nature of the citizens. Aristotle\naccordingly rejects utopian schemes such as the proposal in Plato's\nRepublic that children and property should belong to all the\ncitizens in common. For this runs afoul of the fact that \"people give\nmost attention to their own property, less to what is communal, or\nonly as much as falls to them to give attention\" (Pol.\nII.3.1261b33–5). Aristotle is also wary of casual political\ninnovation, because it can have the deleterious side-effect of\nundermining the citizens' habit of obeying the law\n(II.8.1269a13–24). For a further discussion of the theoretical\nfoundations of Aristotle's politics, see the following supplementary\ndocument: \nIt is in these terms, then, that Aristotle understands the fundamental\nnormative problem of politics: What constitutional form should the\nlawgiver establish and preserve in what material for the sake of what\nend?  \nAristotle states that “the politician and lawgiver is wholly\noccupied with the city-state, and the constitution is a certain way of\norganizing those who inhabit the city-state” (III.1.1274b36-8).\nHis general theory of constitutions is set forth in Politics\nIII. He begins with a definition of the citizen\n(politês), since the city-state is by nature a\ncollective entity, a multitude of citizens. Citizens are distinguished\nfrom other inhabitants, such as resident aliens and slaves; and even\nchildren and seniors are not unqualified citizens (nor are most\nordinary workers). After further analysis he defines the citizen as a\nperson who has the right (exousia) to participate in\ndeliberative or judicial office (1275b18–21). In Athens, for\nexample, citizens had the right to attend the assembly, the council,\nand other bodies, or to sit on juries. The Athenian system differed\nfrom a modern representative democracy in that the citizens were more\ndirectly involved in governing. Although full citizenship tended to be\nrestricted in the Greek city-states (with women, slaves, foreigners,\nand some others excluded), the citizens were more deeply enfranchised\nthan in modern representative democracies because they were more\ndirectly involved in governing. This is reflected in Aristotle's\ndefinition of the citizen (without qualification). Further, he defines\nthe city-state (in the unqualified sense) as a multitude of such\ncitizens which is adequate for a self-sufficient life (1275b20-21).\n \nAristotle defines the constitution (politeia) as a way of\norganizing the offices of the city-state, particularly the sovereign\noffice (III.6.1278b8–10; cf. IV.1.1289a15–18). The\nconstitution thus defines the governing body, which takes different\nforms: for example, in a democracy it is the people, and in an\noligarchy it is a select few (the wealthy or well born). Before\nattempting to distinguish and evaluate various constitutions Aristotle\nconsiders two questions. First, why does a city-state come into being?\nHe recalls the thesis, defended in Politics I.2, that human\nbeings are by nature political animals, who naturally want to live\ntogether. For a further discussion of this topic, see the following\nsupplementary document: \nHe then adds that “the common advantage also brings them\ntogether insofar as they each attain the noble life. This is above all\nthe end for all both in common and separately”\n(III.6.1278b19–24). Second, what are the different forms of rule\nby which one individual or group can rule over another? Aristotle\ndistinguishes several types of rule, based on the nature of the soul\nof the ruler and of the subject. He first considers despotic rule,\nwhich is exemplified in the master-slave relationship. Aristotle\nthinks that this form of rule is justified in the case of natural\nslaves who (he asserts without evidence) lack a deliberative faculty\nand thus need a natural master to direct them (I.13.1260a12; slavery\nis defended at length in Politics I.4–8). Although a\nnatural slave allegedly benefits from having a master, despotic rule\nis still primarily for the sake of the master and only incidentally\nfor the slave (III.6.1278b32–7). (Aristotle provides no argument\nfor this: if some persons are congenitally incapable of\nself-governance, why should they not be ruled primarily for their own\nsakes?) He next considers paternal and marital rule, which he also\nviews as defensible: “the male is by nature more capable of\nleadership than the female, unless he is constituted in some way\ncontrary to nature, and the elder and perfect [is by nature more\ncapable of leadership] than the younger and imperfect”\n(I.12.1259a39-b4). Aristotle is persuasive when he argues that\nchildren need adult supervision because their rationality is\n“imperfect” (ateles) or immature. But he is\nunconvincing to modern readers when he alleges (without\nsubstantiation) that, although women have a deliberative faculty, it\nis “without authority” (akuron), so that females\nrequire male supervision (I.13.1260a13–14). (Aristotle's\narguments about slaves and women appear so weak that some commentators\ntake them to be ironic. However, what is obvious to a modern reader\nneed not have been so to an ancient Greek, so that it is not necessary\nto suppose that Aristotle's discussion is ironic.) It is noteworthy,\nhowever, that paternal and marital rule are properly practiced for the\nsake of the ruled (for the sake of the child and of the wife\nrespectively), just as arts like medicine or gymnastics are practiced\nfor the sake of the patient (III.6.1278b37–1279a1). In this\nrespect they resemble political rule, which is the form of rule\nappropriate when the ruler and the subject have equal and similar\nrational cacapacities. This is exemplified by naturally equal citizens\nwho take turns at ruling for one another's advantage\n(1279a8–13). This sets the stage for the fundamental claim of\nAristotle's constitutional theory: “constitutions which aim at\nthe common advantage are correct and just without qualification,\nwhereas those which aim only at the advantage of the rulers are\ndeviant and unjust, because they involve despotic rule which is\ninappropriate for a community of free persons”\n(1279a17–21).  \nThe distinction between correct and deviant constitutions is combined\nwith the observation that the government may consist of one person, a\nfew, or a multitude. Hence, there are six possible constitutional\nforms (Politics III.7): \nThis six-fold classification (which is adapted from Plato's\nStatesman 302c-d) sets the stage for Aristotle's inquiry into\nthe best constitution, although it is modified in various ways\nthroughout the Politics. For example, he observes that the\ndominant class in oligarchy (literally rule of the oligoi,\ni.e., few) is typically the wealthy, whereas in democracy (literally\nrule of the dêmos, i.e., people) it is the poor, so\nthat these economic classes should be included in the definition of\nthese forms (see Politics III.8, IV.4, and VI.2 for\nalternative accounts). Also, polity is later characterized as a kind\nof “mixed” constitution typified by rule of the\n“middle” group of citizens, a moderately wealthy class\nbetween the rich and poor (Politics IV.11). \nAristotle's constitutional theory is based on his theory of justice,\nwhich is expounded in Nicomachean Ethics book V. Aristotle\ndistinguishes two different but related senses of\n“justice” — universal and particular — both of\nwhich play an important role in his constitutional theory. Firstly, in\nthe universal sense “justice” means\n“lawfuless” and is concerned with the common advantage and\nhappiness of the political community (NE\nV.1.1129b11–19, cf. Pol. III.12.1282b16–17). The\nconception of universal justice undergirds the distinction between\ncorrect (just) and deviant (unjust) constitutions. But what exactly\nthe “common advantage” (koinion sumpheron)\nentails is a matter of scholarly controversy. Some passages imply that\njustice involves the advantage of all the citizens; for example, every\ncitizen of the best constitution has a just claim to private property\nand to an education (Pol. VII.9.1329a23–4,\n13.1332a32–8). But Aristotle also allows that it might be\n“in a way” just to ostracize powerful citizens even when\nthey have not been convicted of any crimes (III.13.1284b15–20).\nWhether Aristotle understands the common advantage as safeguarding the\ninterests of each and every citizen has a bearing on whether he\nanticipates what moderns would understand as a theory of individual\nrights. (See Fred Miller and Richard Kraut for differing\ninterpretations.) \nSecondly, in the particular sense “justice” means\n“equality” or “fairness”, and this includes\ndistributive justice, according to which different individuals have\njust claims to shares of some common asset such as property. Aristotle\nanalyzes arguments for and against the different constitutions as\ndifferent applications of the principle of distributive justice\n(III.9.1280a7–22). Everyone agrees, he says, that justice\ninvolves treating equal persons equally, and treating unequal persons\nunequally, but they do not agree on the standard by which individuals\nare deemed to be equally (or unequally) meritorious or deserving. He\nassumes his own analysis of distributive justice set forth in\nNicomachean Ethics V.3: Justice requires that benefits be\ndistributed to individuals in proportion to their merit or desert. The\noligarchs mistakenly think that those who are superior in wealth\nshould also have superior political rights, whereas the democrats hold\nthat those who are equal in free birth should also have equal\npolitical rights. Both of these conceptions of political justice are\nmistaken in Aristotle's view, because they assume a false conception\nof the ultimate end of the city-state. The city-state is neither a\nbusiness enterprise to maximize wealth (as the oligarchs suppose) nor\nan association to promote liberty and equality (as the democrats\nmaintain). Instead, Aristotle argues, “the good life is the end\nof the city-state,” that is, a life consisting of noble actions\n(1280b39–1281a4). Hence, the correct conception of justice is\naristocratic, assigning political rights to those who make a full\ncontribution to the political community, that is, to those with virtue\nas well as property and freedom (1281a4–8). This is what\nAristotle understands by an “aristocratic” constitution:\nliterally, the rule of the aristoi, i.e., best persons.\nAristotle explores the implications of this argument in the remainder\nof Politics III, considering the rival claims of the rule of\nlaw and the rule of a supremely virtuous individual. Here absolute\nkingship is a limiting case of aristocracy. Again, in books VII-VIII,\nAristotle describes the ideal constitution in which the citizens are\nfully virtuous. \nThe purpose of political science is to guide “the good lawgiver\nand the true politician” (IV.1.1288b27). Like any complete\nscience or craft, it must study a range of issues concerning its\nsubject matter. For example, gymnastics (physical education) studies\nwhat sort of training is best or adapted to the body that is naturally\nthe best, what sort of training is best for most bodies, and what\ncapacity is appropriate for someone who does not want the condition or\nknowledge appropriate for athletic contests. Political science studies\na comparable range of constitutions (1288b21–35): first, the\nconstitution which is best without qualification, i.e., “most\naccording to our prayers with no external impediment”; second,\nthe constitution that is best under the circumstances “for it is\nprobably impossible for many persons to attain the best\nconstitution”; third, the constitution which serves the aim a\ngiven population happens to have, i.e., the one that is best\n“based on a hypothesis”: “for [the political\nscientist] ought to be able to study a given constitution, both how it\nmight originally come to be, and, when it has come to be, in what\nmanner it might be preserved for the longest time; I mean, for\nexample, if a particular city happens neither to be governed by the\nbest constitution, nor to be equipped even with necessary things, nor\nto be the [best] possible under existing circumstances, but to be a\nbaser sort.” Hence, Aristotelian political science is not\nconfined to the ideal system, but also investigates the second-best\nconstitution or even inferior political systems, because this may be\nthe closest approximation to full political justice which the lawgiver\ncan attain under the circumstances.  \nRegarding the constitution that is ideal or “according to\nprayer,” Aristotle criticizes the views of his predecessors in\nPolitics and then offers a rather sketchy blueprint of his\nown in Politics VII and VIII. Although his own political\nviews were influenced by his teacher Plato, Aristotle is highly\ncritical of the ideal constitution set forth in Plato's\nRepublic on the grounds that it overvalues political unity,\nit embraces a system of communism that is impractical and inimical to\nhuman nature, and it neglects the happiness of the individual citizens\n(Politics II.1–5). In contrast, in Aristotle's\n“best constitution,” each and every citizen will possess\nmoral virtue and the equipment to carry it out in practice, and\nthereby attain a life of excellence and complete happiness (see\nVII.13.1332a32–8). All of the citizens will hold political\noffice and possess private property because “one should call the\ncity-state happy not by looking at a part of it but at all the\ncitizens.” (VII.9.1329a22–3). Moreover, there will be a\ncommon system of education for all the citizens, because they share\nthe same end (Pol. VIII.1). \nIf (as is the case with most existing city-states) the population\nlacks the capacities and resources for complete happiness, however,\nthe lawgiver must be content with fashioning a suitable constitution\n(Politics IV.11). The second-best system typically takes the\nform of a polity (in which citizens possess an inferior, more common\ngrade of virtue) or mixed constitution (combining features of\ndemocracy, oligarchy, and, where possible, aristocracy, so that no\ngroup of citizens is in a position to abuse its rights). Aristotle\nargues that for city-states that fall short of the ideal, the best\nconstitution is one controlled by a numerous middle class which stands\nbetween the rich and the poor. For those who possess the goods of\nfortune in moderation find it “easiest to obey the rule of\nreason” (Politics IV.11.1295b4–6). They are\naccordingly less apt than the rich or poor to act unjustly toward\ntheir fellow citizens. A constitution based on the middle class is the\nmean between the extremes of oligarchy (rule by the rich) and\ndemocracy (rule by the poor). “That the middle [constitution] is\nbest is evident, for it is the freest from faction: where the middle\nclass is numerous, there least occur factions and divisions among\ncitizens” (IV.11.1296a7–9). The middle constitution is\ntherefore both more stable and more just than oligarchy and\ndemocracy. \nAlthough Aristotle classifies democracy as a deviant constitution\n(albeit the best of a bad lot), he argues that a case might be made\nfor popular rule in Politics III.11, a discussion which has\nattracted the attention of modern democratic theorists. The central\nclaim is that the many may turn out to be better than the virtuous few\nwhen they come together, even though the many may be inferior when\nconsidered individually. For if each individual has a portion of\nvirtue and practical wisdom, they may pool these assets and turn out\nto be better rulers than even a very wise individual. This argument\nseems to anticipate treatments of “the wisdom of the\nmultitude” such as Condorcet's “jury theorem.” This\nparticular chapter has been widely discussed by in recent years in\nconnection with topics such as democratic deliberation and public\nreason. \nIn addition, the political scientist must attend to existing\nconstitutions even when they are bad. Aristotle notes that “to\nreform a constitution is no less a task [of politics] than it is to\nestablish one from the beginning,” and in this way “the\npolitician should also help existing constitutions”\n(IV.1.1289a1–7). The political scientist should also be\ncognizant of forces of political change which can undermine an\nexisting regime. Aristotle criticizes his predecessors for excessive\nutopianism and neglect of the practical duties of a political\ntheorist. However, he is no Machiavellian. The best constitution still\nserves as a regulative ideal by which to evaluate existing\nsystems. \nThese topics occupy the remainder of the Politics. Books\nIV–VI are concerned with the existing constitutions: that is,\nthe three deviant constitutions, as well as polity or the\n“mixed” constitution, which are the best attainable under\nmost circumstances (IV.2.1289a26–38). The mixed constitution has\nbeen of special interest to scholars because it looks like a\nforerunner of modern republican regimes. The whole of book V\ninvestigates the causes and prevention of revolution or political\nchange (metabolê). Books VII–VIII are devoted to\nthe ideal constitution. As might be expected, Aristotle's attempt to\ncarry out this program involves many difficulties, and scholars\ndisagree about how the two series of books (IV–VI and\nVII–VIII) are related to each other: for example, which were\nwritten first, which were intended to be read first, and whether they\nare ultimately consistent with each other. For a further discussion of\nthis topic, see the following supplementary document: \nAristotle has continued to influence thinkers up to the present\nthroughout the political spectrum, including conservatives (such as\nHannah Arendt, Leo Strauss, and Eric Voegelin), communitarians (such\nas Alasdair MacIntyre and Michael Sandel), liberals (such as William\nGalston and Martha C. Nussbaum), libertarians (such as Tibor R.\nMachan, Douglas B. Rasmussen, and Douglas J. Den Uyl), and democratic\ntheorists (such as Jill Frank and Gerald M. Mara). \nIt is not surprising that such diverse political persuasions can lay\nclaim to Aristotle as a source. For his method often leads to\ndivergent interpretations. When he deals with a difficult problem, he\nis inclined to consider opposing arguments in a careful and nuanced\nmanner, and he is often willing to concede that there is truth on each\nside. For example, though he is critical of democracy, in one passage\nhe allows that the case for rule by the many based on the superior\nwisdom of the multitude “perhaps also involves some truth”\n(Pol. III.11.1281a39-42). Again, he sometimes applies his own\nprinciples in a questionable manner, for example, when he reasons that\nbecause associations should be governed in a rational manner, the\nhousehold should be run by the husband rather than by the wife, whose\nrational capacity “lacks authority” (I.13.1260a13). Modern\ncommentators sympathetic with Aristotle's general approach often\ncontend that in this case he applies his own principles\nincorrectly–leaving open the question of how they\nshould be applied. Further, the way he applies his principles\nmay have seemed reasonable in his socio-political context–for\nexample, that the citizen of a polity (normally the best attainable\nconstitution) must be a hoplite soldier (cf. III.7,1297b4)–but\nit may be debatable how these might apply within a modern democratic\nnation-state. \nThe problem of extrapolating to modern political affairs can be\nillustrated more fully in connection with Aristotle's discussion of\nlegal change in Politics II.8. He first lays out the argument\nfor making the laws changeable. It has been beneficial in the case of\nmedicine, for example, for it to progress from traditional ways to\nimproved forms of treatment. An existing law may be a vestige of a\nprimitive barbaric practice. For instance, Aristotle mentions a law in\nCyme that allows an accuser to produce a number of his own relatives\nas witnesses to prove that a defendant is guilty of murder.\n“So,” Aristotle concludes, “it is evident from the\nforegoing that some laws should sometimes be changed. But to those who\nlook at the matter from a different angle, caution would seem to be\nrequired” (1269a12-14). Since the law gets its force from the\ncitizens' habit of obedience, great care should be exercised in making\nany change in it. It may sometimes be better to leave defective laws\nin place rather than encouraging lawlessness by changing the laws too\nfrequently. Moreover, there are the problems of how the laws are to be\nchanged and who is to change them. Although Aristotle offers valuable\ninsights, he breaks off the discussion of this topic and never takes\nit up elsewhere. We might sum up his view as follows: When it comes to\nchanging the laws, observe the mean: don't be too bound by traditional\nlaws, but on the other hand don't be overeager in altering them. It is\nobvious that this precept, reasonable as it is, leaves considerable\nroom for disagreement among contemporary\n“neo-Aristotelian” theorists. For example, should the laws\nbe changed to allow self-described transsexual persons to use sexually\nsegregated restrooms? Conservatives and liberals might agree with\nAristotle's general stricture regarding legal change but differ widely\non how to apply it in a particular case. \nMost scholars of Aristotle make no attempt to show that he is aligned\nwith any contemporary ideology. Rather, insofar as they find him\nrelevant to our times, it is because he offers a remarkable synthesis\nof idealism and realpolitik unfolding in deep and thought-provoking\ndiscussions of perennial concerns of political philosophy: the role of\nhuman nature in politics, the relation of the individual to the state,\nthe place of morality in politics, the theory of political justice,\nthe rule of law, the analysis and evaluation of constitutions, the\nrelevance of ideals to practical politics, the causes and cures of\npolitical change and revolution, and the importance of a morally\neducated citizenry.
