Best\nknown for his original and influential work on embodiment, perception,\nand ontology, he also made important contributions to the philosophy\nof art, history, language, nature, and politics.  Associated in his\nearly years with the existentialist movement through his friendship\nwith Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, Merleau-Ponty played a\ncentral role in the dissemination of phenomenology, which he sought to\nintegrate with Gestalt psychology, psychoanalysis, Marxism, and\nSaussurian linguistics. Major influences on his thinking include Henri\nBergson, Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Max Scheler, and Jean-Paul\nSartre, as well as neurologist Kurt Goldstein, Gestalt theorists such\nas Wolfgang Köhler and Kurt Koffka, and literary figures\nincluding Marcel Proust, Paul Claudel, and Paul Valéry. In\nturn, he influenced the post-structuralist generation of French\nthinkers who succeeded him, including Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze,\nand Jacques Derrida, whose similarities with and debt to the later\nMerleau-Ponty have often been underestimated. Merleau-Ponty published\ntwo major theoretical texts during his lifetime: The Structure of\nBehavior (1942 SC) and\nPhenomenology of Perception (1945 PP). Other important\npublications include two volumes of political philosophy, Humanism\nand Terror (1947 HT) and Adventures of the Dialectic\n(1955 AdD), as well as two books of collected essays on art,\nphilosophy, and politics: Sense and Non-Sense\n([1948]1996b/1964) and Signs (1960/1964). Two unfinished\nmanuscripts appeared posthumously: The Prose of the World\n(1969/1973), drafted in 1950–51; and The Visible and the\nInvisible (1964 V&I), on which he was working at the time of\nhis death. Lecture notes and student transcriptions of many of his\ncourses at the Sorbonne and the Collège de France have also\nbeen published.\n\n\nFor most of his career, Merleau-Ponty focused on the problems of\nperception and embodiment as a starting point for clarifying the\nrelation between the mind and the body, the objective world and the\nexperienced world, expression in language and art, history, politics,\nand nature. Although phenomenology provided the overarching framework\nfor these investigations, Merleau-Ponty also drew freely on empirical\nresearch in psychology and ethology, anthropology, psychoanalysis,\nlinguistics, and the arts. His constant points of historical reference\nare Descartes, Kant, Hegel, and Marx. The characteristic approach of\nMerleau-Ponty’s theoretical work is his effort to identify an\nalternative to intellectualism or idealism, on the one hand, and\nempiricism or realism, on the other, by critiquing their common\npresupposition of a ready-made world and failure to account for the\nhistorical and embodied character of experience. In his later\nwritings, Merleau-Ponty becomes increasingly critical of the\nintellectualist tendencies of the phenomenological method as well,\nalthough with the intention of reforming rather than abandoning it.\nThe posthumous writings collected in The Visible and the\nInvisible aim to clarify the ontological implications of a\nphenomenology that would self-critically account for its own\nlimitations. This leads him to propose concepts such as\n“flesh” and “chiasm” that many consider to be\nhis most fruitful philosophical contributions.\n\n\nMerleau-Ponty’s thought has continued to inspire contemporary\nresearch beyond the usual intellectual history and interpretive\nscholarship, especially in the areas of feminist philosophy,\nphilosophy of mind and cognitive science, environmental philosophy and\nphilosophy of nature, political philosophy, philosophy of art,\nphilosophy of language, and phenomenological ontology. His work has\nalso been widely influential on researchers outside the discipline of\nphilosophy proper, especially in anthropology, architecture, the arts,\ncognitive science, environmental theory, film studies, linguistics,\nliterature, and political theory.\n\nMerleau-Ponty was born in Rochefort-sur-Mer, in the province of\nCharente-Maritime, on March 14,\n 1908.[1]\n After the death in 1913 of his father, a colonial artillery captain\nand a knight of the Legion of Honor, he moved with his family to\nParis. He would later describe his childhood as incomparably happy,\nand he remained very close to his mother until her death in 1953.\nMerleau-Ponty pursued secondary studies at the Parisian lycees\nJanson-de-Sailly and Louis-le-Grand, completing his first course in\nphilosophy at Janson-de-Sailly with Gustave Rodrigues in\n1923–24. He won the school’s “Award for Outstanding\nAchievement” in philosophy that year and would later trace his\ncommitment to the vocation of philosophy to this first course. He was\nalso awarded “First Prize in Philosophy” at Louis-le-Grand\nin 1924–25. He attended the École Normale\nSupérieure from 1926 to 1930, where he befriended Simone de\nBeauvoir and Claude Lévi-Straus. Some evidence suggests that,\nduring these years, Merleau-Ponty authored a novel, Nord.\nRécit de l’arctique, under the pseudonym Jacques\nHeller (Alloa 2013b). His professors at ENS included Léon\nBrunschvicg and Émile Bréhier, the latter supervising\nhis research on Plotinus for the Diplôme d’études\nsupérieures in 1929. Bréhier would continue to supervise\nMerleau-Ponty’s research through the completion of his two\ndoctoral dissertations in 1945. During his student years,\nMerleau-Ponty attended Husserl’s 1929 Sorbonne lectures and\nGeorges Gurvitch’s 1928–1930 courses on German philosophy.\nHe received the agrégation in philosophy in 1930,\nranking in second place.  \nAfter a year of mandatory military service, Merleau-Ponty taught at\nthe lycee in Beauvais from 1931 to 1933, pursued a year of research on\nperception funded by a subvention from the Caisse nationale des\nsciences (the precursor of today’s Centre national de la\nrecherche scientifique) in 1933–34, and taught at the lycee in\nChartres in 1934–35. From 1935 to 1940, he was a tutor\n(agégé-répétiteur) at the\nÉcole Normale Supérieure, where his primary duty was to\nprepare students for the agrégation. During this\nperiod, he attended Alexandre Kojève’s lectures on Hegel\nand Aron Gurwitsch’s lectures on Gestalt psychology. His first\npublications also appeared during these years, as a series of review\nessays on Max Scheler’s Ressentiment (1935), Gabriel\nMarcel’s Being and Having (1936), and Sartre’s\nImagination\n (1936).[2]\n In 1938, he completed his thèse\ncomplémentaire, originally titled Conscience et\ncomportement [Consciousness and Behavior] and published\nin 1942 as La structure du comportement [The Structure of\nBehavior, SC]. He was the first outside visitor to the newly\nestablished Husserl Archives in Louvain, Belgium, in April 1939, where\nhe met Eugen Fink and consulted Husserl’s unpublished\nmanuscripts, including Ideen II and later sections of Die\nKrisis. \nWith the outbreak of World War Two, Merleau-Ponty served for a year as\nlieutenant in the 5th Infantry Regiment and 59th\nLight Infantry Division, until he was wounded in battle in June 1940,\ndays before the signing of the armistice between France and Germany.\nHe was awarded the Croix de guerre, recognizing bravery in\ncombat. After several months of convalescence, he returned to teaching\nat the Lycée Carnot in Paris, where he remained from 1940 until\n1944. In November 1940, he married Suzanne Jolibois, and their\ndaughter Marianne was born in June 1941. In the winter of\n1940–41, Merleau-Ponty renewed his acquaintance with Jean-Paul\nSartre, whom he had met as a student at the École Normale,\nthrough their involvement in the resistance group Socialisme et\nLiberté. The group published around ten issues of an\nunderground review until the arrest of two members in early 1942 led\nto its dissolution. After the conclusion of the war, in 1945,\nMerleau-Ponty would collaborate with Sartre and Beauvoir to found\nLes Temps Modernes, a journal devoted to\n“littérature engagée”, for which he served\nas political editor until 1952. \nAt the end of the 1943–44 school year, Merleau-Ponty completed\nhis main thesis, Phénoménologie de la\nperception [Phenomenology of Perception, PP], and in\n1944–45 he taught at the Lycée Condorcet in Paris,\nreplacing Sartre during the latter’s leave from this position.\nMerleau-Ponty defended his two dissertations in July 1945, fulfilling\nthe requirements for the Docteur ès lettres, which was\nawarded “with distinction”. In October 1945, Les Temps\nModernes published its inaugural issue; Merleau-Ponty was a\nfounding member of the journal’s governing board, managed its\ndaily affairs, and penned many of its editorials that were signed\nsimply “T.M.”, even though he refused to allow his name to\nbe printed on the cover alongside Sartre’s as the review’s\nDirector. That fall, Merleau-Ponty was appointed to the post of\nMaître de conférences in Psychology at the\nUniversity of Lyon, where he was promoted to the rank of Professor in\nthe Chair of Psychology in 1948. From 1947 to 1949, he also taught\nsupplementary courses at the École Normale Supérieure,\nwhere his students included the young Michel Foucault. Student notes\n(taken by Jean Deprun) from Merleau-Ponty’s 1947–48 course\non “The Union of the Soul and the Body in Malebranche, Biran,\nand Bergson”—a course that he taught at both Lyon and\nE.N.S. to prepare students for the agrégation and\nwhich was attended by Foucault—were published in 1968\n(1997b/2001). \nIn 1947, Merleau-Ponty participated regularly in the Collège\nphilosophique, an association formed by Jean Wahl to provide an open\nvenue for intellectual exchange without the academic formality of the\nSorbonne, and frequented by many leading Parisian thinkers.\nMerleau-Ponty published his first book of political philosophy in\n1947, Humanisme et terreur, essai sur le problème\ncommuniste [Humanism and Terror: An Essay on the Communist\nProblem, 1969, HT], in which he responded to the developing\nopposition between liberal democracies and communism by cautioning a\n“wait-and-see” attitude toward Marxism. A collection of\nessays concerning the arts, philosophy, and politics, Sens et\nnon-sense [Sense and Non-Sense, 1996b/1964], appeared in\n1948. In the fall of 1948, Merleau-Ponty delivered a series of seven\nweekly lectures on French national radio that were subsequently\npublished as Causeries 1948 (2002/2004). \nMerleau-Ponty declined an invitation to join the Department of\nPhilosophy at the University of Chicago as a Visiting Professor in\n1948–49, but instead received a leave from Lyon for the year to\npresent a series of lectures at the University of Mexico in early\n1949. Later in 1949, Merleau-Ponty was appointed Professor of Child\nPsychology and Pedagogy at the University of Paris, and in this\nposition lectured widely on child development, psychoanalysis,\nphenomenology, Gestalt psychology, and anthropology. His eight courses\nfrom the Sorbonne are known from compiled student notes reviewed by\nhim and published in the Sorbonne’s Bulletin de\npsychologie (1988/2010). Merleau-Ponty held this position for\nthree years until his election, in 1952, to the Chair of Philosophy at\nthe Collège de France, the most prestigious post for a\nphilosopher in France, which he would hold until his death in 1961. At\nforty-four, Merleau-Ponty was the youngest person ever elected to this\nposition, but his appointment was not without controversy. Rather than\nfollowing the typical procedure of ratifying the vote of the General\nAssembly of Professors, who had selected Merleau-Ponty as their lead\ncandidate, the Académie des sciences morales et\npolitiques made the unprecedented decision to remove his name\nfrom the list of candidates; the Académie’s\ndecision was subsequently overturned by the Minister of Education\nhimself, who allowed the faculty vote in favor of Merleau-Ponty to\nstand. Merleau-Ponty’s January 1953 inaugural lecture at the\nCollège de France was published under the title\nÉloge de la Philosophie [In Praise of\nPhilosophy, 1953/1963]. Many of his courses from the\nCollège de France have subsequently been published, based\neither on student notes or Merleau-Ponty’s own lecture notes\n(1964b, 1968/1970, 1995/2003, 1996a, 1998/2002, 2003/2010, 2011,\n2013). \nIn the face of growing political disagreements with Sartre set in\nmotion by the Korean War, Merleau-Ponty resigned his role as political\neditor of Les Temps Modernes in December of 1952 and withdrew\nfrom the editorial board altogether in 1953. His critique of\nSartre’s politics became public in 1955 with Les Aventures\nde la dialectique [Adventures of the Dialectic, 1973\nAdD], in which Merleau-Ponty distanced himself from revolutionary\nMarxism and sharply criticized Sartre for\n“ultrabolshevism”. Beauvoir’s equally biting\nrebuttal, “Merleau-Ponty and Pseudo-Sartreanism”,\npublished the same year in Les Temps Modernes, accuses\nMerleau-Ponty of willfully misrepresenting Sartre’s position,\nopening a rift between the three former friends that would never\nentirely heal. Merleau-Ponty’s intellectual circle during his\nyears at the Collège de France included Lévi-Straus and\nJacques Lacan, and for several years he was a regular contributor to\nthe popular weekly magazine L’Express. In October and\nNovember 1955, on a commission from Alliance\nfrançaise, Merleau-Ponty visited several African\ncountries, including Tunisia, French Equatorial Africa, the Belgian\nCongo, and Kenya, where he delivered a series of lectures on the\nconcept of race, colonialism, and development. In 1956, he published\nLes Philosophes célèbres [Famous\nPhilosophers], a large edited volume of original introductions to\nkey historical and contemporary thinkers (beginning, interestingly,\nwith philosophers from India and China) whose contributors included\nGilles Deleuze, Gilbert Ryle, Alfred Schutz, and Jean Starobinski. In\nApril 1957, Merleau-Ponty declined to accept induction into\nFrance’s Order of the Legion of Honor, presumably in protest\nover the inhumane actions of the Fourth Republic, including the use of\ntorture, during the Battle of Algiers. In October and November of\n1957, as his second commission from Alliance\nfrançaise, he lectured in Madagascar, Reunion Island, and\nMauritius, citing as a primary motivation for accepting the commission\nhis desire to see first-hand the effects of reforms in French policies\ngoverning overseas territories. The last book Merleau-Ponty published\nduring his lifetime, Signes [Signs, 1960/1964],\nappearing in 1960, collecting essays on art, language, the history of\nphilosophy, and politics that spanned more than a decade. His last\npublished essay, “L’Œil et l’esprit”\n[“Eye and Mind”, 1964a OEE] addressing the ontological\nimplications of painting, appeared in the 1961 inaugural issue of\nArt de France. Merleau-Ponty died of a heart attack in Paris\non May 3rd, 1961, at the age of 53, with Descartes’\nOptics open on his desk. \nMerleau-Ponty’s friend and former student Claude Lefort\npublished two of his teacher’s unfinished manuscripts\nposthumously: La prose du monde [The Prose of the\nWorld, 1969/1973], an exploration of literature and expression\ndrafted in 1950–51 and apparently abandoned; and Le visible\net l’invisible [The Visible and the Invisible,\n1968 V&I], a manuscript and numerous working notes from\n1959–1961 that present elements of Merleau-Ponty’s mature\nontology. The latter manuscript was apparently part of a larger\nproject, Être et Monde [Being and World], for\nwhich two additional unpublished sections were substantially drafted\nin 1957–1958: La Nature ou le monde du silence\n[Nature or the World of Silence] and Introduction\nà l’ontologie [Introduction to Ontology]\n(Saint Aubert 2013:\n 28).[3]\n These manuscripts, along with many of Merleau-Ponty’s other\nunpublished notes and papers, were donated to the Bibliothèque\nNationale de France by Suzanne Merleau-Ponty in 1992 and are available\nfor consultation by\n scholars.[4] \nMerleau-Ponty’s lifelong interest in the philosophical status of\nperception is already reflected in his successful 1933 application for\na subvention to study the nature of perception, where he proposes to\nsynthesize recent findings in experimental psychology (especially\nGestalt psychology) and neurology to develop an alternative to\ndominant intellectualist accounts of perception inspired by critical\n(Kantian) philosophy. Interestingly, this early proposal emphasizes\nthe significance of the perception of one’s own body for\ndistinguishing between the “universe of perception” and\nits intellectual reconstructions, and it gestures toward the\n“realist philosophers of England and America” (presumably\nWilliam James and A. N. Whitehead, as presented in Jean Wahl’s\n1932 Vers le concret) for their insights into the\nirreducibility of the sensory and the concrete to intellectual\nrelations. While this initial proposal makes no mention of\nphenomenology, Merleau-Ponty’s subsequent 1934 report on the\nyear’s research, noting the limitations of approaching the\nphilosophical study of perception through empirical research alone,\nemphasizes the promise of Husserlian phenomenology for providing a\ndistinctively philosophical framework for the investigation of\npsychology. In particular, Merleau-Ponty mentions the distinction\nbetween the natural and transcendental attitudes and the\nintentionality of consciousness as valuable for “revising the\nvery notions of consciousness and sensation” (NP: 192/78). He also\ncites approvingly Aron Gurwitsch’s claim that Husserl’s\nanalyses “lead to the threshold of\nGestaltpsychologie”, the second area of focus in this\nearly study. The Gestalt is “a spontaneous organization of the\nsensory field” in which there are “only organizations,\nmore or less stable, more or less articulated” (NP: 193/79).\nMerleau-Ponty’s brief summary of Gestalt psychology,\nanticipating research presented in his first two books, emphasizes the\nfigure-ground structure of perception, the phenomena of depth and\nmovement, and the syncretic perception of children. Nevertheless,\nMerleau-Ponty concludes—again citing Gurwitsch—that the\nepistemological framework of Gestalt psychology remains Kantian,\nrequiring that one look “in a very different direction, for a\nvery different solution” to the problem of the relation between\nthe world described naturalistically and the world as perceived (NP: 198/82). \nMerleau-Ponty’s first book, The Structure of Behavior\n(SC), resumes the project of synthesizing and reworking the insights\nof Gestalt theory and phenomenology to propose an original\nunderstanding of the relationship between “consciousness”\nand “nature”. Whereas the neo-Kantian idealism then\ndominant in France (e.g., Léon Brunschvicg, Jules Lachelier)\ntreated nature as an objective unity dependent on the synthetic\nactivity of consciousness, the realism of the natural sciences and\nempirical psychology assumed nature to be composed of external things\nand events interacting causally. Merleau-Ponty argues that neither\napproach is tenable: organic life and human consciousness are emergent\nfrom a natural world that is not reducible to its meaning for a mind;\nyet this natural world is not the causal nexus of pre-existing\nobjective realities, since it is fundamentally composed of nested\nGestalts, spontaneously emerging structures of organization at\nmultiple levels and degrees of integration. On the one hand, the\nidealist critique of naturalism should be extended to the naturalistic\nassumptions framing Gestalt theory. On the other hand, there is a\njustified truth in naturalism that limits the idealist\nuniversalization of consciousness, and this is discovered when Gestalt\nstructures are recognized to be ontologically basic and the\nlimitations of consciousness are thereby exposed. The notion of\n“behavior”, taken by Merleau-Ponty as parallel to the\nphenomenological concept of “experience” (in explicit\ncontrast with the American school of behaviorism), is a privileged\nstarting point for the analysis thanks to its neutrality with respect\nto classical distinctions between the “mental” and the\n“physiological” (SC: 2/4). \nThe Structure of Behavior first critiques traditional reflex\naccounts of the relation between stimulus and reaction in light of the\nfindings of Kurt Goldstein and other contemporary physiologists,\narguing that the organism is not passive but imposes its own\nconditions between the given stimulus and the expected response, so\nthat behavior remains inexplicable in purely anatomical or atomistic\nterms. Merleau-Ponty instead describes the nervous system as a\n“field of forces” apportioned according to “modes of\npreferred distribution”, a model inspired by Wolfgang\nKöhler’s Gestalt physics (SC: 48/46). Both physiology and\nbehavior are “forms”, that is,  \ntotal processes whose properties are not the sum of those which the\nisolated parts would possess…. [T]here is form wherever the\nproperties of a system are modified by every change brought about in a\nsingle one of its parts and, on the contrary, are conserved when they\nall change while maintaining the same relationship among themselves.\n(SC: 49–50/47)  \nForm or structure therefore describes dialectical, non-linear, and\ndynamic relationships that can function relatively autonomously and\nare irreducible to linear mechanical causality (see Thompson\n2007). \nThe critique of physiological atomism is also extended to theories of\nhigher behavior, such as Pavlov’s theory of conditioned\nreflexes. Merleau-Ponty argues that such accounts rely on gratuitous\nhypotheses lacking experimental justification and cannot effectively\nexplain brain function or learning. In the case of brain function,\nexperimental work on brain damage demonstrates that localization\nhypotheses must be rejected in favor of a global process of neural\norganization comparable to the figure-ground structures of perceptual\norganization. Similarly, learning cannot be explained in terms of\ntrial-and-error fixing of habitual reactions, but instead involves a\ngeneral aptitude with respect to typical structures of situations.\nMerleau-Ponty proposes an alternative tripartite classification of\nbehavior according to the degree to which the structures toward which\nit is oriented emerge thematically from their content.\nSyncretic behaviors, typical of simpler organisms such as\nants or toads, respond to all stimuli as analogues of vital situations\nfor which the organism’s responses are instinctually prescribed\nby its “species a priori”, with no possibility for\nadaptive learning or improvisation. Amovable behaviors are\noriented toward signals of varying complexity that are not a function\nof the organism’s instinctual equipment and can lead to genuine\nlearning. Here the organism, guided by its vital norms, responds to\nsignals as relational structures rather than as objective properties\nof things. Drawing on Köhler’s experimental work with\nchimpanzees, Merleau-Ponty argues that even intelligent non-human\nanimals lack an orientation toward objective things, which emerges\nonly at the level of symbolic behavior. While amovable\nbehavior remains attached to immediate functional structures, symbolic\nbehavior (here limited to humans) is open to virtual, expressive, and\nrecursive relationships across structures, making possible the human\norientation toward objectivity, truth, creativity, and freedom from\nbiologically determined norms. \nMore generally, Merleau-Ponty proposes that matter, life, and mind are\nincreasingly integrative levels of Gestalt structure, ontologically\ncontinuous but structurally discontinuous, and distinguished by the\ncharacteristic properties emergent at each integrative level of\ncomplexity. A form is defined here as  \na field of forces characterized by a law which has no meaning outside\nthe limits of the dynamic structure considered, and which on the other\nhand assigns its properties to each internal point so much so that\nthey will never be absolute properties, properties of this\npoint. (SC: 148/137–38)  \nMerleau-Ponty argues that this understanding extends to all physical\nlaws, which “express a structure and have meaning only within\nthis structure”; the laws of physics always refer back to\n“a sensible or historical given” and ultimately to the\nhistory of the universe (SC: 149/138, 157/145). At the level of life, form is\ncharacterized by a dialectical relation between the organism and its\nenvironment that is a function of the organism’s vital norms,\nits “optimal conditions of activity and its proper manner of\nrealizing equilibrium”, which express its style or\n“general attitude toward the world” (SC: 161/148). Living\nthings are not oriented toward an objective world but toward an\nenvironment that is organized meaningfully in terms of their\nindividual and specific style and vital goals. \nMind, the symbolic level of form that Merleau-Ponty identifies with\nthe human, is organized not toward vital goals but by the\ncharacteristic structures of the human world: tools, language,\nculture, and so on. These are not originally encountered as things or\nideas, but rather as “significative intentions” embodied\nwithin the world. Mind or consciousness cannot be defined formally in\nterms of self-knowledge or representation, then, but is essentially\nengaged in the structures and actions of the human world and\nencompasses all of the diverse intentional orientations of human life.\nWhile mind integrates within itself the subordinate structures of\nmatter and life, it goes beyond these in its thematic orientation\ntoward structures as such, which is the condition for such\ncharacteristically human symbolic activities as language and\nexpression, the creation of new structures beyond those set by vital\nneeds, and the power of choosing and varying points of view (which\nmake truth and objectivity possible). In short, mind as a second-order\nor recursive structure is oriented toward the virtual rather than\nsimply toward the real. Ideally, the subordinate structure of life\nwould be fully absorbed into the higher order of mind in a fully\nintegrated human being; the biological would be transcended by the\n“spiritual”. But integration is never perfect or complete,\nand mind can never be detached from its moorings in a concrete and\nembodied situation. \nMerleau-Ponty emphasizes throughout The Structure of Behavior\nthat form, even though ontologically fundamental, cannot be accounted\nfor in the terms of traditional realism; since form is fundamentally\nperceptual, an “immanent signification”, it retains an\nessential relationship with consciousness. But the “perceptual\nconsciousness” at stake here is not the transcendental\nconsciousness of critical philosophy. The last chapter of The\nStructure of Behavior clarifies this revised understanding of\nconsciousness in dialogue with the classical problem of the relation\nbetween the soul and the body in order to account for the relative\ntruths of both transcendental philosophy and naturalism. The issue\nconcerns how to reconcile the perspective of consciousness as\n“universal milieu” (i.e., transcendental consciousness)\nwith consciousness as “enrooted in the subordinated\ndialectics”, that is, as a Gestalt emerging from lower-order\nGestalts (i.e., perceptual consciousness) (SC: 199/184). In the natural\nattitude of our pre-reflective lives, we are committed to the view\nthat our perceptual experience of things is always situated and\nperspectival (i.e., that physical objects are presented through\n“profiles”, Husserl’s Abschattungen), but\nalso that we thereby experience things “in themselves”, as\nthey really are in the mind-independent world; the perspectival\ncharacter of our opening onto the world is not a limitation of our\naccess but rather the very condition of the world’s disclosure\nin its inexhaustibility. At the level of this prereflective faith in\nthe world, there is no dilemma of the soul’s separation from the\nbody; “the soul remains coextensive with nature” (SC:\n203/189). \nThis prereflective unity eventually splinters under our awareness of\nillness, illusion, and anatomy, which teach us to separate nature,\nbody, and thought into distinct orders of events partes extra\npartes. This culminates in a naturalism that cannot account for\nthe originary situation of perception that it displaces, yet on which\nit tacitly relies; perception requires an “internal”\nanalysis, paving the way for transcendental idealism’s treatment\nof subject and object as “inseparable correlatives” (SC:\n215/199). But transcendental idealism in the critical tradition\nsubsequently goes too far: by taking consciousness as “milieu of\nthe universe, presupposed by every affirmation of the world”, it\nobscures the original character of the perceptual relation and\nculminates in “the dialectic of the epistemological subject and\nthe scientific object” (SC: 216/200, 217/201). Merleau-Ponty aims to\nintegrate the truth of naturalism and transcendental thought by\nreinterpreting both through the concept of structure, which accounts\nfor the unity of soul and body as well as their relative distinction.\nAgainst the conception of transcendental consciousness as a pure\nspectator correlated with the world, Merleau-Ponty insists that mind\nis an accomplishment of structural integration that remains\nessentially conditioned by the matter and life in which it is\nembodied; the truth of naturalism lies in the fact that such\nintegration is essentially fragile and incomplete. Since\n“integration is never absolute and always fails”, the\ndualism of mind and body  \nis not a simple fact; it is founded in principle—all integration\npresupposing the normal functioning of subordinated formations, which\nalways demand their own due. (SC: 226–27/210) \nThe Structure of Behavior concludes with a call for further\ninvestigation of “perceptual consciousness”, a task taken\nup by its sequel, Phenomenology of Perception. In the\nconcluding pages of Structure, Merleau-Ponty offers a\npreliminary sketch of phenomenologically inspired approaches to the\n“problem of perception” that set the stage for his\nsubsequent work, emphasizing (a) the difference between what is\ndirectly given as an aspect of individual lived experience and\nintersubjective significations that are only encountered virtually;\nand (b) the distinctiveness of one’s own body, which is never\nexperienced directly as one objective thing among many. The book\nconcludes by identifying the “problem of perception” as\nits encompassing concern:  \nCan one conceptualize perceptual consciousness without eliminating it\nas an original mode; can one maintain its specificity without\nrendering inconceivable its relation to intellectual consciousness?\n(SC: 241/224)  \nThe solution requires a “return to perception as to a type of\noriginary experience” by means of an “inversion of the\nnatural movement of consciousness”, an inversion that\nMerleau-Ponty here equates with Husserl’s phenomenological\nreduction (SC: 236/220). If successful, this rehabilitation of the status\nof perception would lead to a redefinition of transcendental\nphilosophy “in such a way as to integrate with it the very\nphenomenon of the real” (SC: 241/224). \nCompleted in 1944 and published the following year, Phenomenology\nof Perception (PP) is the work for which Merleau-Ponty was best\nknown during his lifetime and that established him as the leading\nFrench phenomenologist of his generation. Here Merleau-Ponty develops\nhis own distinctive interpretation of phenomenology’s method,\ninformed by his new familiarity with Husserl’s unpublished\nmanuscripts and his deepened engagement with other thinkers in this\ntradition, such as Eugen Fink and Martin Heidegger. Phenomenology\nof Perception again draws extensively on Gestalt theory and\ncontemporary research in psychology and neurology; the case of\nSchneider, a brain-damaged patient studied by Adhémar Gelb and\nKurt Goldstein, serves as an extended case-study. Psychological\nresearch complements and, at times, serves as a counterpoint to\nphenomenological descriptions of perceptual experience across a wide\nrange of existential dimensions, including sexuality, language, space,\nnature, intersubjectivity, time, and freedom. In\nPhenomenology, Merleau-Ponty develops a characteristic rhythm\nof presenting, first, the realist or empiricist approach to a\nparticular dimension of experience, followed then by its idealist or\nintellectualist alternative, before developing a third way that avoids\nthe problematic assumption common to both, namely, their\n“unquestioned belief in the world”: the prejudice that the\nobjective world exists as a ready-made and fully present reality. \nPhenomenology of Perception introduces its inquiry with a\ncritique of the “classical prejudices” of empiricism and\nintellectualism. Merleau-Ponty rejects the empiricist understanding of\nsensation, with its correlative “constancy hypothesis”,\nand the role empiricism grants to association and the projection of\nmemory for treating the basic units of sensation as determinate atoms\nrather than as meaningful wholes. These wholes include ambiguities,\nindeterminacies, and contextual relations that defy explanation in\nterms of the causal action of determinate things. Intellectualism aims\nto provide an alternative to empiricism by introducing judgment or\nattention as mental activities that synthesize experience from the\nsensory givens, yet it adopts empiricism’s starting point in\ndispersed, atomic sensations. Both approaches are guilty of reading\nthe results of perception (the objective world) back into perceptual\nexperience, thereby falsifying perception’s characteristic\nstructure: the spontaneous organization or configuration of perceived\nphenomena themselves, with their indeterminacies and ambiguities, and\nthe dynamic character of perception as an historical process involving\ndevelopment and transformation. By treating perception as a causal\nprocess of transmission or a cognitive judgment, empiricism and\nintellectualism deny any meaningful configuration to the perceived as\nsuch and treat all values and meanings as projections, leaving no\nbasis in perception itself for distinguishing the true from the\nillusory. \nIn contrast, Merleau-Ponty argues that the basic level of perceptual\nexperience is the gestalt, the meaningful whole of figure against\nground, and that the indeterminate and contextual aspects of the\nperceived world are positive phenomenon that cannot be eliminated from\na complete account. Sensing, in contrast with knowing, is a\n“living communication with the world that makes it present to us\nas the familiar place of our life” (PP: 79/53), investing the\nperceived world with meanings and values that refer essentially to our\nbodies and lives. We forget this “phenomenal field”, the\nworld as it appears directly to perception, as a consequence of\nperception’s own tendency to forget itself in favor of the\nperceived that it discloses. Perception orients itself toward the\ntruth, placing its faith in the eventual convergence of perspectives\nand progressive determination of what was previously indeterminate.\nBut it thereby naturally projects a completed and invariant\n“truth in itself” as its goal. Science extends and\namplifies this natural tendency through increasingly precise\nmeasurements of the invariants in perception, leading eventually to\nthe theoretical construction of an objective world of determinate\nthings. Once this determinism of the “in itself” is\nextended universally and applied even to the body and the perceptual\nrelation itself, then its ongoing dependence on the “originary\nfaith” of perception is obscured; perception is reduced to\n“confused appearances” that require methodical\nreinterpretation, and the eventual result is dualism, solipsism, and\nskepticism. The “fundamental philosophical act” would\ntherefore be to “return to the lived world beneath the objective\nworld” (PP: 83/57). This requires a transcendental reduction: a\nreversal of perception’s natural tendency to cover its own\ntracks and a bracketing of our unquestioned belief in the objective\nworld. Yet this cannot be a recourse to any transcendental\nconsciousness that looks on the world from outside and is not itself\nemergent from and conditioned by the phenomenal field. Rather than a\ntranscendental ego, Merleau-Ponty speaks of a “transcendental\nfield”, emphasizing that reflection always has a situated and\npartial perspective as a consequence of being located within the field\non which it reflects. \nThe first of the three major parts of Phenomenology concerns\nthe body. As we have seen, perception transcends itself toward a\ndeterminate object “in itself”, culminating in an\nobjective interpretation of the body. Part One shows the limits of\nthis objective account and sketches an alternative understanding of\nthe body across a series of domains, including the experience of\none’s own body, lived space, sexuality, and language. Through a\ncontrast with pathological cases such as phantom limbs, Merleau-Ponty\ndescribes the body’s typical mode of existence as\n“being-toward-the-world”—a pre-objective orientation\ntoward a vital situation that is explicable neither in terms of\nthird-person causal interactions nor by explicit judgments or\nrepresentations. The body’s orientation toward the world is\nessentially temporal, involving a dialectic between the present body\n(characterized, after Husserl, as an “I can”) and the\nhabit body, the sedimentations of past activities that take on a\ngeneral, anonymous, and autonomous character. While the body’s\nrelation to the world serves as the essential background for the\nexperience of any particular thing, the body itself is experienced in\nways that distinguish it in kind from all other things: it is a\npermanent part of one’s perceptual field, even though one cannot\nin principle experience all of it directly; it has “double\nsensations”, such as when one hand touches another, that enact a\nform of reflexivity; it has affective experiences that are not merely\nrepresentations; and its kinesthetic sense of its own movements is\ngiven directly. \nThis kinesthetic awareness is made possible by a pre-conscious system\nof bodily movements and spatial equivalences that Merleau-Ponty terms\nthe “body schema”. In contrast with the “positional\nspatiality” of things, the body has a “situational\nspatiality” that is oriented toward actual or possible tasks\n(PP: 129/102). The body’s existence as\n“being-toward-the-world”, as a projection toward lived\ngoals, is therefore expressed through its spatiality, which forms the\nbackground against which objective space is constituted. Merleau-Ponty\nintroduces here the famous case of Schneider, whose reliance on\npathological substitutions for normal spatial abilities helps to\nbring the body’s typical relationship with lived space to\nlight. Schneider lacks the ability to “project” into\nvirtual space; more generally, his injury has disrupted the\n“intentional arc” that  \nprojects around us our past, our future, our human milieu, our\nphysical situation, our ideological situation, and our moral\nsituation, or rather, that ensures that we are situated within all of\nthese relationships. (PP: 170/137)  \nThe body’s relationship with space is therefore intentional,\nalthough as an “I can” rather than an “I\nthink”; bodily space is a multi-layered manner of relating to\nthings, so that the body is not “in” space but lives or\ninhabits it. \nJust as bodily space reflects an originary form of\nintentionality—a pre-cognitive encounter with the world as\nmeaningfully structured—the same is shown to be the case for\nsexuality and for language. Sexuality takes on a special significance\nbecause it essentially expresses the metaphysical drama of the human\ncondition while infusing the atmosphere of our lives with sexual\nsignificance. Like space and sexuality, speech is also a form of\nbodily expression. Language does not initially encode ready-made\nthoughts but rather expresses through its style or physiognomy as a\nbodily gesture. We mistake language for a determined code by taking\nhabitual or sedimented language as our model, thereby missing\n“authentic” or creative speech. Since language, like\nperception, hides its own operations in carrying us toward its\nmeaning, it offers an ideal of truth as its presumptive limit,\ninspiring our traditional privileging of thought or reason as\ndetachable from all materiality. But, at a fundamental level, language\nis comparable to music in the way that it remains tied to its material\nembodiment; each language is a distinct and ultimately untranslatable\nmanner of “singing the world”, of extracting and\nexpressing the “emotional essence” of our surroundings and\nrelationships (PP: 228/193). \nHaving rediscovered the body as expressive and intentional,\nMerleau-Ponty turns in Part Two of Phenomenology to the\nperceived world, with the aim of showing how the pre-reflective unity\nof co-existence that characterizes the body has as its correlate the\nsynthesis of things and the world; “One’s own body is in\nthe world just as the heart is in the organism” (PP: 245/209), and\nits expressive unity therefore also extends to the sensible world.\nMerleau-Ponty develops this interpretation of the sensible through\ndetailed studies of sensing, space, and the natural and social worlds.\nSensing takes place as the “co-existence” or\n“communion” of the body with the world that Merleau-Ponty\ndescribes as a reciprocal exchange of question and answer:  \na sensible that is about to be sensed poses to my body a sort of\nconfused problem. I must find the attitude that will provide it with\nthe means to become determinate … I must find the response to a\npoorly formulated question. And yet I only do this in response to its\nsolicitation… . The sensible gives back to me what I had lent\nto it, but I received it from the sensible in the first place. (PP:\n259/222)  \nAs co-existence, sensing is characterized by an intentionality that\nsympathetically attunes itself to the sensed according to a dialectic\nin which both terms—the perceiving body and the perceived\nthing—are equally active and receptive: the thing invites the\nbody to adopt the attitude that will lead to its disclosure. Since the\nsubject of this perception is not the idealist’s “for\nitself”, neither is the object of perception the realist’s\n“in itself”; rather, the agent of perception is the\npre-reflective and anonymous subjectivity of the body, which remains\nenmeshed in and “connatural” with the world that it\nperceives. The senses are unified without losing their distinctness in\na fashion comparable to the binocular synthesis of vision, and their\nanonymity is a consequence of the “historical thickness”\nof perception as a tradition that operates beneath the level of\nreflective consciousness (PP: 285/248). For first-person awareness,\none’s anonymous perceptual engagement with the world operates as\na kind of “original past, a past that has never been\npresent” (PP: 252/252). \nThe pre-historical pact between the body and the world informs our\nencounters with space, revealing a synthesis of space that is neither\n“spatialized” (as a pre-given container in which things\nare arranged) nor “spatializing” (like the homogenous and\ninterchangeable relations of geometrical space). Drawing on\npsychological experiments concerning bodily orientation, depth, and\nmovement, Merleau-Ponty argues that empiricist and intellectualist\naccounts of space must give way to a conception of space as\nco-existence or mutual implication characterized by existential\n“levels”: our orientation toward up and down, or toward\nwhat is in motion or stationary, is a function of the body’s\nadoption of a certain level within a revisable field of possibilities.\nLived inherence in space contrasts with the abstract space of the\nanalytical attitude, revindicating the existential space of night,\ndreams, or myths in relation to the abstract space of the\n“objective” world. \nThe properties of things that we take to be “real” and\n“objective” also tacitly assume a reference to the\nbody’s norms and its adoption of levels. An object’s\n“true” qualities depend on the body’s privileging of\norientations that yield maximum clarity and richness. This is possible\nbecause the body serves as a template for the style or logic of the\nworld, the concordant system of relations that links the qualities of\nan object, the configuration of the perceptual field, and background\nlevels such as lighting or movement. In this symbiosis or\ncall-and-response between the body and the world, things have sense as\nthe correlates of my body, and reality therefore always involves a\nreference to perception. Yet, to be real, things cannot be reducible\nto correlates of the body or perception; they retain a depth and\nresistance that provides their existential index. While each thing has\nits individual style, the world is the ultimate horizon or background\nstyle against which any particular thing can appear. The perspectival\nlimitations of perception, both spatially and temporally, are the\nobverse of this world’s depth and inexhaustibility. Through an\nexamination of hallucination and illusions, Merleau-Ponty argues that\nskepticism about the existence of the world makes a category mistake.\nWhile we can doubt any particular perception, illusions can appear\nonly against the background of the world and our primordial faith in\nit. While we never coincide with the world or grasp it with absolute\ncertainty, we are also never entirely cut off from it; perception\nessentially aims toward truth, but any truth that it reveals is\ncontingent and revisable. \nRejecting analogical explanations for the experience of other people,\nMerleau-Ponty proposes that the rediscovery of the body as a\n“third genre of being between the pure subject and the\nobject” makes possible encounters with embodied others (PP:\n407/366). We perceive others directly as pre-personal and embodied living\nbeings engaged with a world that we share in common. This encounter at\nthe level of anonymous and pre-personal lives does not, however,\npresent us with another person in the full sense, since our situations\nare never entirely congruent. The perception of others involves an\nalterity, a resistance, and a plenitude that are never reducible to\nwhat is presented, which is the truth of solipsism. Our common\ncorporeality nevertheless opens us onto a shared social world, a\npermanent dimension of our being in the mode of the anonymous and\ngeneral “someone”. The perception of others is therefore a\nprivileged example of the paradox of transcendence running through our\nencounter with the world as perceived:  \nWhether it is a question of my body, the natural world, the past,\nbirth or death, the question is always to know how I can be open to\nphenomena that transcend me and that, nevertheless, only exist to the\nextent that I take them up and live them. (PP: 422/381)  \nThis “fundamental contradiction” defines our encounters\nwith every form of transcendence and requires new conceptions of\nconsciousness, time, and freedom. \nThe fourth and final section of Phenomenology explores these\nthree themes, starting with a revision of the concept of the cogito\nthat avoids reducing it to merely episodic psychological fact or\nelevating it to a universal certainty of myself and my\ncogitationes. Merleau-Ponty argues that we cannot separate\nthe certainty of our thoughts from that of our perceptions, since to\ntruly perceive is to have confidence in the veracity of one’s\nperceptions. Furthermore, we are not transparent to ourselves, since\nour “inner states” are available to us only in a situated\nand ambiguous way. The genuine cogito, Merleau-Ponty argues, is a\ncogito “in action”: we do not deduce “I am”\nfrom “I think”, but rather the certainty of “I\nthink” rests on the “I am” of existential\nengagement. More basic than explicit self-consciousness and\npresupposed by it is an ambiguous mode of self-experience that\nMerleau-Ponty terms the silent or “tacit” cogito—our\npre-reflective and inarticulate grasp on the world and ourselves that\nbecomes explicit and determinate only when it finds expression for\nitself. The illusions of pure self-possession and\ntransparency—like all apparently “eternal”\ntruths—are the results of acquired or sedimented language and\nconcepts. \nRejecting classic approaches to time that treat it either as an\nobjective property of things, as a psychological content, or as the\nproduct of transcendental consciousness, Merleau-Ponty returns to the\n“field of presence” as our foundational experience of\ntime. This field is a network of intentional relations, of\n“protentions” and “retentions”, in a single\nmovement of dehiscence or self-differentiation, such that “each\npresent reaffirms the presence of the entire past that it drives away,\nand anticipates the presence of the entire future or the\n‘to-come’” (PP: 483/444). Time in this sense is\n“ultimate subjectivity”, understood not as an eternal\nconsciousness, but rather as the very act of temporalization. As with\nthe tacit cogito, the auto-affection of time as ultimate subjectivity\nis not a static self-identity but involves a dynamic opening toward\nalterity. In this conception of time as field of presence, which\n“reveals the subject and the object as two abstract moments of a\nunique structure, namely, presence” (PP: 494/454–55),\nMerleau-Ponty sees the resolution to all problems of transcendence as\nwell as the foundation for human freedom. Against the Sartrean\nposition that freedom is either total or null, Merleau-Ponty holds\nthat freedom emerges only against the background of our\n“universal engagement in a world”, which involves us in\nmeanings and values that are not of our choosing. We must recognize,\nfirst, an “authochthonous sense of the world that is constituted\nin the exchange between the world and our embodied existence”\n(PP: 504/466), and, second, that the acquired habits and the sedimented\nchoices of our lives have their own inertia. This situation does not\neliminate freedom but is precisely the field in which it can be\nachieved. Taking class consciousness as his example, Merleau-Ponty\nproposes that this dialectic of freedom and acquisition provides the\nterms for an account of history, according to which history can\ndevelop a meaning and a direction that are neither determined by\nevents nor necessarily transparent to those who live through it. \nThe Preface to Phenomenology of Perception, completed after\nthe main text, offers Merleau-Ponty’s most detailed and\nsystematic exposition of the phenomenological method. His account is\norganized around four themes: the privileging of description over\nscientific explanation or idealist reconstruction, the\nphenomenological reduction, the eidetic reduction, and intentionality.\nPhenomenology sets aside all scientific or naturalistic explanations\nof phenomena in order to describe faithfully the pre-scientific\nexperience that such explanations take for granted. Similarly, since\nthe world exists prior to reflective analysis or judgment,\nphenomenology avoids reconstructing actual experience in terms of its\nconditions of possibility or the activity of consciousness. The\nphenomenological reduction, on his interpretation, is not an\nidealistic method but an existential one, namely, the reflective\neffort to disclose our pre-reflective engagement with the world.\nThrough the process of the reduction, we discover the inherence of the\none who reflects in the world that is reflected on, and consequently,\nthe essentially incomplete character of every act of reflection, which\nis why Merleau-Ponty claims that the “most important lesson of\nthe reduction is the impossibility of a complete reduction” (PP:\n14/lxxvii). Similarly, the “eidetic reduction”, described by\nHusserl as the intuition of essential relations within the flux of\nconscious experience, is necessary if phenomenology is to make any\ndescriptive claims that go beyond the brute facts of a particular\nexperience. But this does not found the actual world on consciousness\nas the condition of the world’s possibility; instead, “the\neidetic method is that of a phenomenological positivism grounding the\npossible upon the real” (PP: 17/lxxxi). Lastly, Merleau-Ponty\nreinterprets the phenomenological concept of intentionality,\ntraditionally understood as the recognition that all consciousness is\nconsciousness of something. Following Husserl, he\ndistinguishes the “act intentionality” of judgments and\nvoluntary decisions from the “operative intentionality”\nthat “establishes the natural and pre-predicative unity of the\nworld and of our life” (PP: 18/lxxxii). Guided by this broader\nconcept of intentionality, philosophy’s task is to take in the\n“total intention” of a sensible thing, a philosophical\ntheory, or an historical event, which is its “unique manner of\nexisting” or its “existential structure” (PP:\n19–20/lxxxii–lxxxiii). Phenomenology thereby expresses the emergence of\nreason and meaning in a contingent world, a creative task comparable\nto that of the artist or the political activist, which requires an\nongoing “radical” or self-referential reflection on its\nown possibilities. On Merleau-Ponty’s presentation, the tensions\nof phenomenology’s method therefore reflect the nature of its\ntask:  \nThe unfinished nature of phenomenology and the inchoative style in\nwhich it proceeds are not the sign of failure, they were inevitable\nbecause phenomenology’s task was to reveal the mystery of the\nworld and the mystery of reason. (PP: 21–22/lxxxv) \nThe concepts of expression and style are central to\nMerleau-Ponty’s thought and already play a key role in his first\ntwo books, where they characterize the perceptual exchange between an\norganism and its milieu, the body’s sensible dialogue with the\nworld, and even the act of philosophical reflection (see Landes 2013).\nIn both works, Merleau-Ponty draws on a range of literary and artistic\nexamples to describe the creative and expressive dimensions of\nperception and reflection, emphasizing in particular the parallels\nbetween the task of the artist and that of the thinker: as the\nconcluding lines of the Preface to Phenomenology of\nPerception note,  \nPhenomenology is as painstaking as the works of Balzac, Proust,\nValéry, or Cézanne—through the same kind of\nattention and wonder, the same demand for awareness, the same will to\ngrasp the sense of the world or of history in its nascent state. (PP:\n22/lxxxv) \nExpression, particularly in language and the arts, plays an\nincreasingly central role in Merleau-Ponty’s thought in the\nyears following Phenomenology, when he aimed to formulate a\ngeneral theory of expression as the grounding for a philosophy of\nhistory and\n culture.[5]\n This interest is first reflected in a series of essays addressing\npainting, literature, and film published in the years immediately\nfollowing Phenomenology (in Merleau-Ponty 1996b/1964). These\ninclude Merleau-Ponty’s first essay on painting,\n“Cézanne’s Doubt”, which finds in\nCézanne a proto-phenomenological effort to capture the birth of\nperception through painting. Cézanne epitomizes the paradoxical\nstruggle of creative expression, which necessarily relies on the\nidiosyncracies of the artist’s individual history and\npsychology, as well as the resources of the tradition of painting, but\ncan succeed only by risking a creative appropriation of these\nacquisitions in the service of teaching its audience to see the world\nanew. Similarly, Leonardo da Vinci’s artistic productivity is\nexplicable neither in terms of his intellectual freedom\n(Valéry) nor his childhood (Freud) but as the dialectic of\nspontaneity and sedimentation by which Merleau-Ponty had formerly\ndefined history. \nIn 1951, Merleau-Ponty summarizes his research after\nPhenomenology as focused on a “theory of truth”\nexploring how knowledge and communication with others are\n“original formations with respect to perceptual life, but\n… also preserve and continue our perceptual life even while\ntransforming it” (UMP: 41–42/287). Expression, language, and symbolism are the key to\nthis theory of truth and provide the foundation for a philosophy of\nhistory and of “transcendental” humanity. Whereas the\nstudy of perception could only provide a “bad ambiguity”\nthat mixes “finitude and universality”, Merleau-Ponty sees\nin the phenomenon of expression a “good ambiguity” that\n“gathers together the plurality of monads, the past and the\npresent, nature and culture, into a single whole” (UMP: 48/290). Many of\nMerleau-Ponty’s courses from 1947 through 1953 at the University\nof Lyon, the Sorbonne, and the Collège de France focus on\nlanguage, expression, and\n literature.[6] \nThe manuscript partially completed during these years and published\nposthumously as The Prose of the World (1969/1973) pursues\nthese themes through a phenomenological investigation of literary\nlanguage and its relationship with scientific language and painting.\nCritiquing our commonsense ideal of a pure language that would\ntransparently encode pre-existing thoughts, Merleau-Ponty argues that\ninstituted language—the conventional system of language as an\nestablished set of meanings and rules—is derivative from a more\nprimordial function of language as genuinely creative, expressive, and\ncommunicative. Here he draws two insights from Saussurian linguistics:\nFirst, signs function diacritically, through their lateral relations\nand differentiations, rather than through a one-to-one correspondence\nwith a conventionally established meaning. Ultimately, signification\nhappens through the differences between terms in a referential system\nthat lacks any fixed or positive terms. This insight into diacritical\ndifference will later prove important to Merleau-Ponty’s\nunderstanding of perception and ontology as well (see Alloa 2013a).\nSecond, the ultimate context for the operation of language is\neffective communication with others, by which new thoughts can be\nexpressed and meanings shared. Expression accomplishes itself through\na coherent reorganization of the relationships between acquired signs\nthat must teach itself to the reader or listener, and which may\nafterwards again sediment into a taken-for-granted institutional\nstructure. \nIn a long extract from the manuscript that was revised and published\nin 1952 as “Indirect Language and the Voices of Silence”\n(in Merleau-Ponty 1960/1964), Merleau-Ponty brings this understanding\nof language into conversation with Sartre’s What is\nLiterature? and André Malraux’s The Voices of\nSilence. Sharing Malraux’s criticisms of the museum’s\nrole in framing the reception of painting, but rejecting his\ninterpretation of modern painting as subjectivist, Merleau-Ponty\noffers an alternative understanding of “institution” (from\nHusserl’s Stiftung) as the creative establishment of a\nnew field of meaning that opens an historical development. The style\nof an artist is not merely subjective but lived as a historical\ntrajectory of expression that begins with perception itself and\neffects a “coherent deformation” in inherited traditions.\nRather than opposed as silent and speaking, painting and language are\nboth continuations of the expressivity of a perceptual style into more\nmalleable mediums. The unfinished character of modern painting is\ntherefore not a turn from the objectivity of representation toward\nsubjective creation but rather a more authentic testament to the\nparadoxical logic of all expression. \nMerleau-Ponty returns to the analysis of painting in his final essay,\n“Eye and Mind” (1964a OEE), where he accords it an\nontological priority—between the linguistic arts and\nmusic—for revealing the “there is” of the world that\nthe operationalism of contemporary science has occluded. It is by\n“lending his body to the world that the artist changes the world\ninto paintings” (OEE: 16/353), and this presupposes that the\nartist’s body is immersed in and made of the same stuff as the\nworld: to touch, one must be tangible, and to see, visible.\nMerleau-Ponty describes this as an “intertwining” or\n“overlapping”, in which the artist’s situated\nembodiment is the other side of its opening to the world. There is as\nyet no sharp division between the sensing and the sensed, between body\nand things as one common “flesh”, and painting arises as\nthe expression of this relation: it is a “visible to the second\npower, a carnal essence or icon” of embodied vision (OEE: 22/355).\nDescartes’s efforts, in the Optics, to reconstruct\nvision from thought leads him to focus on the “envelope”\nor form of the object, as presented in engraved lines, and to treat\ndepth as a third dimension modeled after height and width. This\nidealization of space has its necessity, yet, once elevated to a\nmetaphysical status by contemporary science, it culminates in an\nunderstanding of being as purely positive and absolutely determinate.\nThe ontological significance of modern painting and the plastic\narts—e.g., Klee, de Staël, Cézanne, Matisse,\nRodin—lies in the alternative philosophy that they embody, as\nrevealed through their treatment of depth, color, line, and movement.\nUltimately, such works teach us anew what it means to see:  \nVision is not a certain mode of thought or presence to self; it is the\nmeans given me for being absent from myself, for being present from\nthe inside at the fission of Being only at the end of which do I close\nup into myself. (OEE: 81/374) \nFrom the first issue of Les Temps Modernes in October 1945\nuntil his death, Merleau-Ponty wrote regularly on politics, including\nreflections on contemporary events as well as explorations of their\nphilosophical underpinnings and the broader political significance of\nhis times. During his eight-year tenure as unofficial managing editor\nof Les Temps Modernes, he charted the review’s\npolitical direction and penned many of its political editorials. After\nleaving Les Temps Modernes in 1953, Merleau-Ponty found new\noutlets for his political writings, including\nL’Express, a weekly newspaper devoted to the\nnon-communist left. Both of the essay collections that he published\nduring his lifetime, Sense and Non-Sense and Signs,\ndevote significant space to his political writings. He also published\ntwo volumes devoted entirely to political philosophy, Humanism and\nTerror (HT) and Adventures of the Dialectic (1955 AdD).\nAlways writing from the left, Merleau-Ponty’s position gradually\nshifted from a qualified Marxism, maintaining a critical distance from\nliberal democracy as well as from Soviet communism, to the rejection\nof revolutionary politics in favor of a “new liberalism”.\nHis political writings have received relatively scant attention\ncompared with other aspects of his philosophy, perhaps because of\ntheir close engagement with the political situations and events of his\nday. Nevertheless, scholars of his political thought emphasize its\ncontinuity with his theoretical writings and ongoing relevance for\npolitical philosophy (see Coole 2007; Whiteside 1998). \nThe 1947 publication of Humanism and Terror responded to\ngrowing anti-communist sentiment in France fueled in part by the\nfictional account of the Moscow trials in Arthur Koestler’s\npopular novel Darkness at Noon. Merleau-Ponty sought to\narticulate an alternative to the choice Europe apparently faced in the\nsolidifying opposition between the United States and the Soviet Union.\nHumanism and Terror criticizes Koestler’s portrayal of\nthe fictional Rubochov, modeled on Nikolai Bukharin, for replacing the\n“mutual praxis” of genuine Marxism (HT: 102/18) with\nan opposition between pure freedom and determined history, the\n“yogi” who withdraws into spiritual ideals or the\n“commissar” who acts by any means necessary. Turning to an\nexamination of Bukharin’s 1938 trial, Merleau-Ponty finds there\nan example of “revolutionary justice” that “judges\nin the name of the Truth that the Revolution is about to make\ntrue” (HT: 114/28), even though the historical contingency that this\nentails is denied by the procedures of the trials themselves. On the\nother hand, Trotsky’s condemnation of Stalinism as\ncounter-revolutionary similarly misses the ambiguity of genuine\nhistory. Ultimately, the dimension of terror that history harbors is a\nconsequence of our unavoidable responsibility in the face of its\nessential contingency and ambiguity. \nAlthough violence is a consequence of the human condition and\ntherefore the starting point for politics, Merleau-Ponty finds hope in\nthe theory of the proletariat for a fundamental transformation in the\nterms of human recognition:  \nThe proletariat is universal de facto, or manifestly in its\nvery condition of life…. [I]t is the sole authentic\nintersubjectivity because it alone lives simultaneously the separation\nand union of individuals. (HT: 221/116–17)  \nA genuinely historical Marxism must recognize that nothing guarantees\nprogress toward a classless society, but also that this end cannot be\nbrought about by non-proletarian means, which is what Soviet communism\nhad apparently forgotten. Despite the failures of the Soviet\nexperiment, Merleau-Ponty remains committed to a humanist Marxism:\n \nMarxism is not just any hypothesis that might be replaced tomorrow by\nsome other. It is the simple statement of those conditions without\nwhich there would be neither any humanism, in the sense of a mutual\nrelation between men, nor any rationality in history. In this sense\nMarxism is not a philosophy of history; it is the philosophy\nof history and to renounce it is to dig the grave of Reason in\nhistory. (HT: 266/153)  \nEven if the proletariat is not presently leading world history, its\ntime may yet come. Merleau-Ponty therefore concludes with a\n“wait-and-see” Marxism that cautions against\ndecontextualized criticisms of Soviet communism as well as apologetics\nfor liberal democracies that whitewash their racist and colonial\nviolence. \nRevelations about the Gulag camps and the outbreak of the Korean War\nforced Merleau-Ponty to revise his position on Marxism and\nrevolutionary politics, culminating in the 1955 Adventures of the\nDialectic (AdD). The book begins with the formulation of a\ngeneral theory of history in conversation with Max Weber. Historians\nnecessarily approach the past through their own perspectives, but,\nsince they are themselves a part of history’s movement, this\nneed not compromise their objectivity. The historical events and\nperiods within which the historian traces a particular style or\nmeaning emerge in conjunction with historical agents, political actors\nor classes, who exercise a creative action parallel to the expressive\ngesture of the artist or the writer. History may eliminate false\npaths, but it guarantees no particular direction, leaving to\nhistorical agents the responsibility for the continuation or\ntransformation of what is inherited from the past through a genius for\ninventing what the times demand: “In politics, truth is perhaps\nonly this art of inventing what will later appear to have been\nrequired by the time” (AdD: 42/29). Merleau-Ponty finds a similar\nposition articulated by the young Georg Lukacs, for whom “There\nis only one knowledge, which is the knowledge of our world in a state\nof becoming, and this becoming embraces knowledge itself” (AdD:\n46/32). History forms a third order, beyond subjects and objects, of\ninterhuman relations inscribed in cultural objects and institutions,\nand with its own logic of sedimentation and spontaneity. The\nself-consciousness that emerges within this third order is precisely\nthe proletariat, whose consciousness is not that of an “I\nthink” but rather the praxis of their common situation and\nsystem of action. Historical truth emerges from the movement of\ncreative expression whereby the Party brings the life of the\nproletariat to explicit awareness, which requires, in return, that the\nworking class recognize and understand itself in the Party’s\nformulations. \nWith this understanding, Lukacs aims to preserve the dialectic of\nhistory, to prevent it from slipping into a simple materialism, and\nthereby to discover the absolute in the relative. But Lukacs\nbacktracks on this position after its official rejection by the\ncommunist establishment in favor of a metaphysical materialism, and\nMerleau-Ponty finds a parallel in Marx’s own turn away from\ngenuine dialectic toward a simple naturalism that justifies any action\nin the name of a historical necessity inscribed in things. For the\nlack of a genuine concept of institution that can recognize dialectic\nin embodied form, Marxist materialism repeatedly abandons its\ndialectical aspirations, as Merleau-Ponty further illustrates through\nthe example of Trostky’s career. \nIn the final chapter of Adventures, Merleau-Ponty turns his\nsights toward Sartre’s endorsement of communism in The\nCommunists and Peace. On Merleau-Ponty’s interpretation,\nSartre’s ontological commitment to a dualism of being and\nnothingness, where the full positivity of determinate things\njuxtaposes with the negating freedom of consciousness, eliminates any\nmiddle ground for history or praxis. Since consciousness is\nunconstrained by any sedimentation or by the autonomous life of\ncultural acquisitions, it can recognize no inertia or spontaneity at\nthe level of institutions, and therefore no genuine historical\nbecoming. More centrally, by interpreting the relation between the\nParty and the proletariat through his own conception of consciousness\nas pure freedom, Sartre rules out in principle any possibility for\ntheir divergence. This leads Sartre to an\n“ultrabolshevism” according to which the Party’s\nposition is identified with the revolutionary agenda, any opposition\nto which must be suppressed. \nIn the Epilogue that summarizes Merleau-Ponty’s own position, he\nexplains his rejection of revolutionary action, understood as\nproletarian praxis, for remaining equivocal rather than truly\ndialectical. The illusion that has brought dialectic to a halt is\nprecisely the investment of history’s total meaning in the\nproletariat, ultimately equating the proletariat with dialectic as\nsuch, which leads to the conviction that revolution would liquidate\nhistory itself. But it is essential to the very structure of\nrevolutions that, when successful, they betray their own revolutionary\ncharacter by sedimenting into institutions. Drawing on the extended\nexample of the French revolution, Merleau-Ponty argues that every\nrevolution mistakes the structure of history for its contents,\nbelieving that eliminating the latter will absolutely transform the\nformer. Thus, “The very nature of revolution is to believe\nitself absolute and to not be absolute precisely because it believes\nitself to be so” (AdD: 298/222). While Soviet communism may continue\nto justify itself in absolute terms, it is concretely a progressivism\nthat tacitly recognizes the relativity of revolution and the gradual\nnature of progress. The alternative that Merleau-Ponty endorses is the\ndevelopment of a “noncommunist left”, an\n“a-communism”, or a “new liberalism”, the\nfirst commitment of which would be to reject the description of the\nrivalry between the two powers as one between “free\nenterprise” and Marxism (AdD: 302–3/225). This noncommunist left would\noccupy a “double position”, “posing social problems\nin terms of [class] struggle” while also “refusing the\ndictatorship of the proletariat” (AdD: 304/226). This pursuit must\nwelcome the resources of parliamentary debate, in clear recognition of\ntheir limitations, since Parliament is “the only known\ninstitution that guarantees a minimum of opposition and of\ntruth” (AdD: 304/226). By exercising “methodical doubt”\ntoward the established powers and denying that they exhaust political\nand economic options, the possibility opens for a genuine dialectic\nthat advances social justice while respecting political freedom. \nThe manuscript and working notes published posthumously as The\nVisible and the Invisible (1964 V&I), extracted from a larger\nwork underway at the time of Merleau-Ponty’s death, is\nconsidered by many to be the best presentation of his later ontology.\nThe main text, drafted in 1959 and 1960, is contemporaneous with\n“Eye and Mind” and the Preface to Signs,\nMerleau-Ponty’s final collection of essays. The first three\nchapters progressively develop an account of “philosophical\ninterrogation” in critical dialogue with scientism, the\nphilosophies of reflection (Descartes and Kant), Sartrean negation,\nand the intuitionisms of Bergson and Husserl. These are followed by a\nstand-alone chapter, “The Intertwining—The Chiasm”,\npresenting Merleau-Ponty’s ontology of flesh. The published\nvolume also includes a brief abandoned section of the text as an\nappendix and more than a hundred pages of selected working notes\ncomposed between 1959 and\n 1961.[7] \nMerleau-Ponty frames the investigation with a description of\n“perceptual faith”, our shared pre-reflective conviction\nthat perception presents us with the world as it actually is, even\nthough this perception is mediated, for each of us, by our bodily\nsenses. This apparent paradox creates no difficulties in our everyday\nlives, but it becomes incomprehensible when thematized by reflection:\n \nThe “natural” man holds on to both ends of the chain,\nthinks at the same time that his perception enters into the\nthings and that it is formed this side of his body. Yet coexist as the\ntwo convictions do without difficulty in the exercise of life, once\nreduced to theses and to propositions they destroy one another and\nleave us in confusion. (V&I: 23–24/8)  \nFor Merleau-Ponty, this “unjustifiable certitude of a sensible\nworld” is the starting point for developing an alternative\naccount of perception, the world, intersubjective relations, and\nultimately being as such. Neither the natural sciences nor psychology\nprovide an adequate clarification of this perceptual faith, since they\nrely on it without acknowledgment even as their theoretical\nconstructions rule out its possibility. Philosophies of reflection,\nexemplified by Descartes and Kant, also fail in their account of\nperception, since they reduce the perceived world to an idea, equate\nthe subject with thought, and undermine any understanding of\nintersubjectivity or a world shared in common (V&I: 62/39, 67/43). \nSartre’s dialectic of being (in-itself) and nothingness\n(for-itself) makes progress over philosophies of reflection insofar as\nit recognizes the ecceity of the world, with which the subject engages\nnot as one being alongside others but rather as a nothingness, that\nis, as a determinate negation of a concrete situation that can\nco-exist alongside other determinate negations. Even so, for Sartre,\npure nothingness and pure being remain mutually exclusive,\nambivalently identical in their perfect opposition, which brings any\nmovement of their dialectic to a halt. The “philosophy of\nnegation” is therefore shown to be a totalizing or\n“high-altitude” thought that remains abstract, missing the\ntrue opening onto the world made possible by the fact that nothingness\nis “sunken into being” (V&I: 121–122/88–89). This\n“bad” dialectic must therefore give way to a\n“hyperdialectic” that remains self-critical about its own\ntendency to reify into fixed and opposed theses (V&I: 129/94). \nThe philosophy of intuition takes two forms: the Wesenschau\nof Husserl, which converts lived experience into ideal essences before\na pure spectator, and Bergsonian intuition, which seeks to coincide\nwith its object by experiencing it from within. Against the first,\nMerleau-Ponty argues that the world’s givenness is more\nprimordial than the ideal essence; the essence is a variant of the\nreal, not its condition of possibility. Essences are not ultimately\ndetachable from the sensible but are its “invisible” or\nits latent structure of differentiation. Against a return to the\nimmediacy of coincidence or a nostalgia for the pre-reflective,\nMerleau-Ponty holds that there is no self-identical presence to\nrejoin; the “immediate” essentially involves distance and\nnon-coincidence. Consequently, truth must be redefined as “a\nprivative non-coinciding, a coinciding from afar, a divergence, and\nsomething like a ‘good error’” (V&I:\n166/124–25). \nIn the final chapter, “The Intertwining—The Chiasm”,\nMerleau-Ponty turns directly to the positive project of describing his\nontology of “flesh”. Intertwining [entrelacs]\nhere translates Husserl’s Verflechtung, entanglement or\ninterweaving, like the woof and warp of a fabric. Chiasm has two\nsenses in French and English that are both relevant to\nMerleau-Ponty’s project: a physiological sense that refers to\nanatomical or genetic structures with a crossed arrangement (such as\nthe optic nerves), and a literary sense referring to figures of speech\nthat repeat structures in reverse order (AB:BA). For Merleau-Ponty,\nthe chiasm is a structure of mediation that combines the\nunity-in-difference of its physiological sense with the reversal and\ncircularity of its literary usage (see Toadvine 2012; Saint Aubert\n2005). A paradigmatic example of chiasmic structure is the\nbody’s doubling into sensible and sentient aspects during\nself-touch. Elaborating on Husserl’s descriptions of this\nphenomenon, Merleau-Ponty emphasizes three consequences: First, the\nbody as sensible-sentient is an “exemplar sensible” that\ndemonstrates the kinship or ontological continuity between subject and\nobject among sensible things in general. Second, this relationship is\nreversible, like “obverse and reverse” or “two\nsegments of one sole circular course” (V&I: 182/138). Third, the\nsentient and sensible never strictly coincide but are always separated\nby a gap or divergence [écart] that defers their\nunity. \nChiasm is therefore a crisscrossing or a bi-directional becoming or\nexchange between the body and things that justifies speaking of a\n“flesh” of things, a kinship between the sensing body and\nsensed things that makes their communication possible. Flesh in this\nsense is a “general thing” between the individual and the\nidea that does not correspond to any traditional philosophical\nconcept, but is closest to the notion of an “element” in\nthe classical sense (V&I: 184/139). Merleau-Ponty denies that this is\na subjective or anthropocentric projection:  \ncarnal being, as a being of depths, of several leaves or several\nfaces, a being in latency, and a presentation of a certain absence, is\na prototype of Being, of which our body, the sensible sentient, is a\nvery remarkable variant, but whose constitutive paradox already lies\nin every visible. (V&I: 179/136)  \nThe generality of flesh embraces an intercorporeity, an anonymous\nsensibility shared out among distinct bodies: just as my two hands\ncommunicate across the lateral synergy of my body, I can touch the\nsensibility of another: “The handshake too is reversible”\n(V&I: 187/142). \nSensible flesh—what Merleau-Ponty calls the\n“visible”—is not all there is to flesh, since flesh\nalso “sublimates” itself into an “invisible”\ndimension: the “rarified” or “glorified” flesh\nof ideas. Taking as his example the “little phrase” from\nVinteuil’s sonata (in Swann’s Way), Merleau-Ponty\ndescribes literature, music, and the passions as “the\nexploration of an invisible and the disclosure of a universe of\nideas”, although in such cases these ideas “cannot be\ndetached from the sensible appearance and be erected into a second\npositivity” (V&I: 196/149). Creative language necessarily\ncarries its meaning in a similarly embodied fashion, while the\nsediments of such expression result in language as a system of\nformalized relations. What we treat as “pure ideas” are\nnothing more than a certain divergence and ongoing process of\ndifferentiation, now occurring within language rather than sensible\nthings. Ultimately we find a relation of reversibility within language\nlike that holding within sensibility: just as, in order to see, my\nbody must be part of the visible and capable of being seen, so, by\nspeaking, I make myself one who can be spoken to (allocutary) and one\nwho can be spoken about (delocutary). While all of the possibilities\nof language are already outlined or promised within the sensible\nworld, reciprocally the sensible world itself is unavoidably inscribed\nwith language. \nThis final chapter of The Visible and the Invisible\nillustrates chiasmic mediation across a range of relations, including\nsentient and sensed, touch and vision, body and world, self and other,\nfact and essence, perception and language. There is not one chiasm but\nrather various chiasmic structures at different levels. As Renaud\nBarbaras notes,  \nIt is necessary … to picture the universe as intuited by\nMerleau-Ponty as a proliferation of chiasms that integrate themselves\naccording to different levels of generality. (1991, 352/2004, 307)  \nThe ultimate ontological chiasm, that between the sensible and the\nintelligible, is matched by an ultimate epistemological chiasm, that\nof philosophy itself. As Merleau-Ponty writes in a working note from\nNovember 1960,  \nthe idea of chiasm, that is: every relation with being is\nsimultaneously a taking and a being held, the hold is held, it is\ninscribed and inscribed in the same being that it takes hold of.\nStarting from there, elaborate an idea of philosophy… . It is\nthe simultaneous experience of the holding and the held in all orders.\n(V&I: 319/266; see also Saint Aubert 2005: 162–64)  \nWhile the generation of French post-structuralist thinkers who\nsucceeded Merleau-Ponty, including Deleuze, Derrida, Irigaray, and\nFoucault, typically distanced themselves from his work, lines of\ninfluence are often recognizable (see Lawlor 2006, 2003; Reynolds\n2004). Irigaray (1993) suggests that Merleau-Ponty’s ontology of\nflesh tacitly relies on feminine and maternal metaphors while\nrendering sexual difference invisible. Derrida’s most detailed\nengagement with Merleau-Ponty, in Le Toucher, Jean-Luc Nancy\n(On Touching—Jean-Luc Nancy, 2000/2005), criticizes the\nlatter’s account of touch and ontology of flesh for its tendency\nto privilege immediacy, continuity, and coincidence over rupture,\ndistance, and untouchability. Nevertheless, Derrida ultimately\nsuspends judgment over the relation between these two tendencies in\nMerleau-Ponty’s final writings. The legacy of\nMerleau-Ponty’s philosophy of embodiment and ontology of flesh\nis also apparent in the work of subsequent French phenomenologists,\nincluding Françoise Dastur, Michel Henry, Henri Maldiney,\nJean-Louis Chrétien, and Jacob Rogozinski. \nRecent English-language scholarship on Merleau-Ponty, inspired by the\navailability of new materials from his course notes and unpublished\nwritings, has focused on his concept of subjectivity (Morris and\nMaclaren 2015; Welsh 2013; Marratto 2012),\nhis relationship to literature,\narchitecture, and the arts (Carbone 2015; Locke & McCann 2015;\nWiskus 2014; Kaushik 2013; Johnson 2010), and his later ontology and\nphilosophy of nature (Foti 2013; Toadvine 2009). His work has also\nmade important contributions to debates in cognitive science (Thompson\n2007; Gallagher 2005), feminism (Olkowski and Weiss 2006;\nHeinämaa 2003), animal studies (Westling 2014; Buchanan 2009;\nOliver 2009), and environmental philosophy (Cataldi & Hamrick\n2007; Abram 1996).","contact.mail":"tat30@psu.edu","contact.domain":"psu.edu"}]
