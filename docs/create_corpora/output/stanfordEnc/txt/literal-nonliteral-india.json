They do so within different intellectual\ndisciplines (śāstra-s), each broadly philosophical,\nbut with varying emphases. Within the grammatical discipline,\nYāska’s Semantic Explanation (Nirukta),\nan early (perhaps 6th century to 3rd century\nBCE) etymological treatise recognizes the difference between ordinary\n(laukika) and metaphorical language (upamā).\nThis text, possibly pre-dating the renowned Sanskrit grammarian\nPāṇini (ca 4th century BCE), employs\netymological analysis in order to ascertain the meanings of unfamiliar\nterms used in the Vedas, a collection of texts including religious\nhymns, poetry, and rituals. In portions of the Vedas called\nUpaniṣads, widely recognized as proto-philosophical, the limits\nof language are made explicit: ordinary speech cannot characterize\nultimate reality, though figurative language can hint at it. These\nearly texts focus on topics which would give rise to three\nintellectual disciplines: Grammar, Philosophy, and Aesthetics.\n(Capital letters distinguish the schools of thought from their subject\nmatter.)\n\n\nTwo of the three disciplines, Grammar and Philosophy, are identifiable\nby their relationship to early “root” texts which form the\nbasis of later commentarial reflection. Within Grammar, the\naforementioned Yāska, as well as Pāṇini,\nPatañjali (ca 2nd century CE), and Bhartṛhari\n(ca 5th century CE), are a few of the most crucial thinkers\nwhose reflections—on the structure of Sanskrit in particular,\nand by way of Sanskrit, language in general—informed\nphilosophical reflection on meaning. For instance,\nPāṇini’s analysis of the morphology, syntax, and\nsemantics of Sanskrit, in his Eight Chapters\n(Aṣṭādhyāyī) continues to be cited\nby philosophers a thousand years later. The literal/non-literal\ndistinction is a topic as well for the various philosophical schools,\neach one known as a darśana, roughly a\n“viewpoint.” Both those who accept the Vedas as\nauthoritative and those who do not address the distinction in the\ncontext of testimony and theories of reference. Among the former Vedic\nthinkers, this article primarily treats the Nyāya and\nMīmāṃsā philosophical traditions, and of the\nVeda-denying, the Buddhists and the Jainas. Finally, the tradition\nhere called Aesthetics (alaṃkāra) is primarily\nfocused on the aesthetics of poetry and drama—especially the\ncourtly poetry known as kāvya. It encompasses topics\nstudied in rhetoric, poetics, and aesthetics.\nAlaṃkāra, despite meaning\n“embellishment” or “ornamentation,” (in\nreference to figures of speech), studies the psychology of utterances,\ntheir ensuing emotional states in audiences, and their logical or\nsemantic structures. Until the highly influential Light on\nSuggestion (Dhvanyāloka) of Ānandavardhana (ca\n9th century CE), aesthetic theory was primarily, though not\nexclusively, focused on taxonomies of figuration, but after\nĀnandavardhana, it drew on philosophical work, in particular\nMīmāṃsā, to theorize about meaning itself.\n\n\nWhat follows focuses on the conceptual space for Indian theorizing\nabout literal and non-literal meaning in each of these three textual\ntraditions. Since the article’s structure is topical rather than\nhistorical, a chronology of major figures is appended to help orient\nreaders. The focus of the article is the period demarcated roughly\nfrom 200 CE to 1300 CE, often characterized as the Classical Period of\nIndian philosophy.\n\nBefore delving into the various disputes in Indian philosophy over\nwhat is commonly termed “literal meaning,” let us first\nidentify the cluster of concepts and corresponding terms Indian\nphilosophers use in their analysis of meaning. The Sanskrit term for\n“meaning,” artha, has a semantic range that\nincludes also “object,” “wealth,” and\n“goal.” It can be used both for external referents of\nwords as well as meanings “in the head,” although the term\nfor occurrent mental states is frequently jñāna,\nusually translated as “cognition” or\n“awareness.” Both words and sentences are said to have\nmeanings, although in what manner they have them, and how word- and\nsentence-meanings interrelate are subjects of debate. \nWhether in the form of words or sentences, language has\ncapacities—it can refer to things, cause mental cognitions,\nimpel action, prompt emotional states, and so on. That such an ability\nexists is accepted by everyone, although thinkers enumerate the\nlinguistic capacities differently, and also identify different results\nfor them. In terms of outcomes, the meaning which results from the\nmost fundamental linguistic capacity of the word is said to be\n“principal” (mukhya) or “denoted”\n(abhidhā). This meaning is sometimes defined in terms of\nits being understood immediately after speech, by hearers. (The extent\nto which the phenomenology of language comprehension guides\ndistinctions about meaning is addressed further below.) For some\nphilosophers, from the cognition that this meaning causes, another\nlinguistic capacity can subsequently operate, given certain\nconditions, to generate a new, “secondary” meaning. This\nfurther meaning is sometimes carved into two varieties: indication\n(lakṣaṇā) and qualitative expression\n(gauṇavṛtti), something like metonymy and\nmetaphor respectively, although this is to generalize over\ndistinctions important especially in Aesthetics. Two other capacities\nare sometimes adduced: purport (tātparya) and suggestion\n(dhvani), which we will examine more closely below.\nInitially, let us characterize the first as something like\nspeaker’s intention and the second as encompassing phenomena\nsuch as connotations and implicatures which the other capacities\nputatively cannot explain. In English scholarship, the first two of\nthese four capacities are referred to as “primary” and\n“secondary,” and this article will follow this\nconvention. \nWhatever the number of capacities, they can be characterized\nfunctionally; in fact, the term function (vyāpāra)\nor operation (vṛtti) is often used in place of the word\nfor capacity more generally. In attempts to enumerate the capacities,\nphilosophers consider questions such as what the basis of a linguistic\nfunction might be, and whether they are one-to-one or one-to-many\nfunctions (Ganeri 2006). Discussion of\nlinguistic functions is important for understanding epistemology, a\ntopic of interest primarily to Philosophy in contrast to Grammar and\nAesthetics (see the entry on\n epistemology in classical Indian philosophy).\n These thinkers focus on how testimonial uses of language are\nauthoritative ways of knowing (pramāṇa), whether\nin ordinary discourse or religious discourse such as the Vedas or the\nBuddha’s speech. For one example, consider Nyāya\n(“Reasoning”). In the Nyāya root text,\nNyāyasūtra (NS), attributed to\nAkṣapāda Gautama (ca 200 CE), speech is defined as the\nassertion of an authoritative person (NS 1.1.7). Since the cognitions\nresulting from testimony are an important basis for acting, Nyāya\nphilosophers are concerned with what hearers understand from speech,\nin particular, from nouns (NS 2.2.56). It is in this context that they\ntake up the relationship between primary and secondary meaning, and\nthe basis for figurative language use. Specifically, they are\nconcerned with whether the principal referent of a noun is—a\ngeneric property, a particular thing, or some combination (their\npreferred view). \nAesthetic thinkers, especially beginning with Ānandavardhana (ca\n9th century CE), focus on distinctions between the\ncapacities of language. Ānandavardhana himself is primarily\nconcerned to defend the existence of a new linguistic capacity,\nsuggestion (on which see\n section 3\n below). With illustrations drawn from poetry, drama, and the epic\nMahābhārata, he argues that phonemes, words, sentences, and\nentire discourse units can suggest subtle meanings, associated with an\naestheticized emotion or “flavor” (rasa). It is\nup to later philosophers of aesthetics to explain the status of\nsuggestion with regard to the ordinary categories of linguistic\ncapacities. Some, like Mukula Bhaṭṭa (ca 9th to\n10th century CE) give a reductionist account on which it is\nequivalent to indication, whereas others, like Bhaṭṭa\nNāyaka (ca 900 CE) deny that it is a linguistic capacity at all,\nbut argue, rather, that it is psychological. Aesthetic arguments for\nand against the various linguistic capacities draw on Nyāya as\nwell as Mīmāṃsā philosophical texts. \nDefinitions of meaning often appeal to phenomenology, the way in which\na cognition seems to arise from hearing a word or sentence. This focus\non the psychology of language use is found in all three disciplines.\nFor example, the Mīmāṃsā\n(“Hermeneutics”) philosopher Kumārila\nBhaṭṭa (ca 7th century CE, see entry on\n Kumārila)\n writes in his Exposition on Ritual Practice\n(Tantravārttika, hereafter TV) that, like a face, the\nprimary meaning is perceived first, before anything else, such as\nsecondary meaning (TV 3.2.1). (The Sanskrit word for a face\nis mukha, etymologically related to mukhya, the term\nfor primary meaning.) The Grammarian Bhartṛhari argues in his\nTreatise on Sentences and Words\n(Vākyapadīya) that division of sentences into words\nand phonemes is artificial. This is in part based his observation that\nhearers experience meaning as a unified whole. He claims that what\nconveys meaning is a sphoṭa, or “burst,”\nwhich is partless and different from the sequence of sounds composing\na sentence (see\n section 4.3\n and Matilal (1990: 84ff) for discussion\nabout how precisely to characterize sphoṭa in\nrelationship to meaning.)  \nAesthetic theorists focus on the psychology of the poet and the\nhearer, in part to understand the relationship between ordinary\nlanguage and poetic language, but also to distinguish among the\nvarieties of poetic utterances. Among the psychological principles\nwidely accepted by Indian thinkers is that ordinary conventional\nmeanings are stronger than analytically-determined ones (Raja\n1969). So the term\npaṅka-ja has constituent parts which together mean\n“mud-born” but conventionally it refers to the lotus, and\nthe latter meaning would come to a hearer’s mind first.\nAesthetic philosopher Mukula Bhaṭṭa argues in his\nFundamentals of the Communicative Function\n(Abhidhāvṛttamātṛkā) that some\nwords become so conventionalized that their status as secondary\nmeaning is unavailable to the speaker, who takes herself to be\nspeaking literally (McCrea 2008, Keating\n2019). \nHowever, there is a limit to the role that reflection on psychology\nplays in the analysis of meaning. For early\nMīmāṃsā philosophers, only Sanskrit terms have\ngenuine expressive capacities.This conclusion is not due to an\ninvestigation of the psychology of non-Sanskrit speakers, but the\nprinciple of parsimony. It is explanatorily better to posit a\nfundamental language, where word and meaning are fixed in one-to-one\ncorrespondence, which has been corrupted by mispronunciation over time\n(see TV 1.3.24ff). So, hearing a foreign word like\ngavi, people understand its meaning, “cow,”\nthrough its similarity with the correct Sanskrit word\n(gauḥ), whether or not they are aware of the process.\nThis view is challenged by other philosophers, such as\nDharmakīrti in his Vādanyāya (Norms of\nDebate). \nReflection on language in Indian philosophy, for the Brahminical,\nVeda-accepting traditions at least, begins and ends with the Sanskrit\nlanguage, in what has been termed “the Sanskrit\ncosmopolis” (Pollock 2006). It is\nnot merely that Sanskrit is the vehicle for reflection on language,\nbut the Sanskrit language itself is a target of inquiry.\nPatañjali explains the reasons for this in his Great\nCommentary (Mahābhāṣya), a commentary on\nKātyāyana’s 3rd century CE commentary on\nPāṇini’s Eight Chapters. These reasons are\nlargely centered on the preservation and correct performance of Vedic\nrituals. Along with these pragmatic aims, there comes the belief in a\nspecial metaphysical and epistemic status for Sanskrit—it has\nnatural (autpattika, without beginning) connections to its\nreferents, which other languages lack; thus, at least in the context\nof the Vedas, it can give us infallible knowledge about the world,\nwithout the corruption of fallible human intermediaries. This\nconception is not shared by all orthoprax thinkers, however, as\nNyāya philosophers argue for the conventionality of language\n(NS 2.1.55). \nTraditions which reject Vedic authority also reject the primacy of\nSanskrit, largely preferring to write in Pāli. At a certain\npoint, however, and for unknown reasons, Buddhist thinkers such as\nNāgārjuna begin to write in Sanskrit (Kelly\n1996). Regardless of which language they\nemploy, Buddhists reject the notion of an inherent connection between\nthe Sanskrit language and reality—indeed, they argue that no\nlanguage has such a connection—arguing as early on as the famous\nThe Questions of King Milinda\n(Milindapañhā) that language is conventional.\nStill, the fact that Naiyāyikas and Buddhists agree on the\nconventional nature of language shows that the religious prominence of\nSanskrit does not necessarily entail specific philosophical\ncommitments about its referential capacities. However, those who take\non the assumption of an innate connection between Sanskrit word and\nreferent then had explanatory burdens, such as how to explain\nlinguistic innovation within Sanskrit and the referential capacities\nof non-Sanskrit languages. \nTraditions which reject Vedic authority also reject the primacy of\nSanskrit, largely preferring to write in Pāli.

While this could be\ncharacterized as the distinction between “literal” and\n“non-literal” meaning, for some philosophers, word\nmeanings that seem intuitively literal are classified as being\nsecondary. For instance, the word “cow” in the sentence\n“A cow is to be led out to pasture” would, according to\nMīmāṃsā philosophers following Kumārila, be\ntaken as an instance of secondary meaning, for reasons discussed\nbelow. Further, since the literal/non-literal distinction in Western\nphilosophy of language is vexed (see the distinction\n“literal/non-literal” in the entry on\n pragmatics),\n this entry henceforth avoids such terminology. \nMost classical Indian thinkers (some Buddhists being an important\nexception, see\n section 4.1)\n understand word meaning, or padārtha, to refer to\nobjects in the world, and to do so directly. For these\nthinkers—Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika,\nMīmāṃsā—the referential function is\nprimary. However, despite broad agreement about the basic referential\nfunction of words, they disagree about what its objects are. One such\ndispute, which has implications for the primary/secondary distinction,\nis over the relationship between words and universals. Kumārila\nargues that the primary referent of words is a universal.\nKumārila’s reasoning is that, without words denoting the\nuniversal property belonging to, for example, all cows, there would\nnot be a permanent (nitya) relationship between word and\nreferent. For if “cow” means a specific cow, Bessie, when\nBessie goes out of existence, the word lacks denotation (ŚV).\nFurther, the Vedic\ninjunction, “A cow is to be tied up,” can be followed in\nnumerous rituals—but if a specific cow were intended, it could\nbe followed only once. (This argument is found in early Grammatical\nthought as well, see below.) Still, despite the fact that all\nMīmāṃsakas accept the requirement of fixity of word\nand referent, they do not all accept the universal-denotation view.\nSome agree with another philosopher, roughly contemporaneous with\nKumārila, Prabhākara (his followers are known as\n“Prābhākaras,” with the first long\n“ā” equivalent to the English “-an” as in\n“Fregean”). They reject the universal-denotation view in\nconnection with their view of sentence meaning (see\n sections 4.3 and 5.1). \nIn contrast, in the NS and its commentaries, Nyāya philosophers\nargue that words refer to universals, forms, and individual things.\nThey point out that universals are never instantiated without\nparticular things, and so the universal alone cannot be the referent.\nBut likewise, since universals are identified by form (a cow is\nrecognized as having cowhood by its particular structure), we must\nalso take it into account. Replying to Mīmāṃsā\nphilosophers who defend and refine the universals-denotation view,\nalong with other opponents who defend individual- and form-only views,\nNyāya philosophers defend and refine the context-dependent view.\nVātsyāyana, for example, in the Commentary on\nNyāya (Nyāyabhāṣya, hereafter NBh),\nargues for an epistemic point, that “It is not known which among\nthese is the object or meaning of the word, or whether all of them\nmight be meant” (NBh 2.2.59; Dasti and\nPhillips 2017). He takes on arguments from interlocutors who\nargue that only the individual or the universal is meant by words.\nVātsyāyana observes that, to take the example of\n“cow” again, one never encounters a bare particular\n(individual). Rather, the individual cow is always found to be\nqualified by the universal. Ceteris paribis for universals,\nwhich do not exist apart from individuals. So it is possible that both\nuniversal and particular are meant together, along with form or shape\n(ākṛti), though in a structured relationship where\none is predominant and the others are subsidiary, the particular\nstructure depending on context. See Dasti\n2020 for a summary of early Nyāya arguments. \nGrammarians also consider the question of word reference.\nPāṇini takes at least a partial position on the question,\nclaiming that if words only refer to particulars, then someone who\nties up one cow for a sacrifice, in response to a Vedic command, would\nbe in error if they, in a later ritual, tie up another cow, as the\ncommand could only refer to a single specific animal (Eight\nChapters 1.2.64). After him, Patañjali, in the Great\nCommentary, refers to two earlier grammarians (whose work is not\nindependently available), Vyāḍi and Vājapyāyana,\nwho differ on this topic. Vyāḍi argues that words primarily\nrefer to particulars and Vājapyāyana claims they refer to\nuniversals. Patañjali splits the difference, claiming that both\naspects are part of word-meaning, but which one is primary may vary\n(see Deshpande 2003; VM;\nand Matilal 1971.) Matilal illustrates\nthe moves in the debate with the example of a compound, “a\nbrave-man” (Sanskrit:\nvīra-puruṣaḥ). Vājapyāyana would\nargue that if “brave” refers to the attribute of\nbraveness, and “man” to the attribute of manhood, then\nthese two referents can be related together in an underlying, unifying\nsubstratum (sāmānādhikaraṇa). But if his\nopponent, Vyāḍi, were correct, there would be no way to\nmake sense of the compound, since both terms would refer to the same\nindividual, and thus there would be repetition. However, by making use\nof the distinction between expressed meaning and the implied ground\nfor the meaning, Vyāḍi could reply: yes,\n“brave” strictly refers to a brave man, but this word is\nused because of the man’s braveness, whereas the other word is\nused because of the man’s being a man. \nWhether the primary word-function results in a particular or\nuniversal, philosophers understand its resultant cognition as a basis\nfor unhesitating action. Word meaning is treated in the context of\nepistemology and the topic of verbal testimony. The two sets of\nphilosophers above, Mīmāṃsakas and Naiyāyikas,\nboth agree that verbal testimony is a way of knowing. However, for\nNyāya philosophers, testimony is authoritative because of the\nspeaker’s characteristics while Mīmāṃsakas\nemphasize the innately authoritative nature of statements, regardless\nof speaker, at at least when it comes to Vedic sentences. While they\nbelieve that sentences (vākya) are truth-bearers, and\nnot individual words, since sentences are composed of words,\nNyāya and Mīmāṃsā philosophers focus on the\ninvariable contributions of words to sentences—their primary\nmeanings. This emphasis, we will see, is not shared by everyone, as\nthe grammarian Bhartṛhari rejects any ultimate metaphysical\ndistinction between words and sentences, arguing that such divisions\nare provisional and arbitrary, even if useful in some contexts. \nIn what follows, we will classify any kind of derivative meaning,\nwhether it be metaphor, metonymy, irony, hyperbole, punning, etc., as\n“secondary.” Again, we are in the realm of word-meanings,\nalthough there is discussion of sentence-level secondary meaning,\nprimarily in Mīmāṃsā, Vedānta, and\nAlaṁkāra. While the task of precisely carving up varieties\nof secondary meaning was frequently left to philosophers working on\naesthetics, other philosophers also took an interest in this question.\nMany stock examples of secondary meaning are shared among the textual\ntraditions, although it is not until much later, in the seventeenth\ncentury, that Indian linguistic analysis becomes robustly\ninterdisciplinary, in the work of Navya-Nyāya (see Bronner\n2002). There are various ways to\nclassify secondary meaning: it may be based on the logical\nrelationship between primary and secondary meaning, on the semantic\ndistance between them, or on the role of speaker intention. \nFor instance, Mukula Bhaṭṭa, the aforementioned\nphilosopher of aesthetics, distinguishes between secondary meaning\nthat is qualitative and secondary meaning that is free from qualities.\nThe qualitative includes metaphorical cases such as “The person\nis an ox,” where the stubbornness of the person and the ox are\nunderstood to be shared qualities. In contrast, cases like “The\nvillage is on the Ganges” are typical of those that are free\nfrom qualities. Here, the word “bank” is understood so as\nto avoid the interpretation that the village is floating on the river\nitself—but there are no properties shared between the village\nand the Ganges (or the bank). In point of fact, Mukula argues that a\nspeaker may intend different secondary meanings with the same\nutterance type, since another reason someone might utter the sentence\nis to communicate that the village and the Ganges do share\nqualities—the holiness of the Ganges river could be attributed\nto the village due to proximity. In this way, the Ganges sentence\ncould exemplify a different utterance, one where there is\n“semantic imbuing” of the qualities of the river to the\nbank (Keating 2019:55, 117–126). Thus whether a speaker intends\nor does not intend a secondary meaning becomes relevant to its\ncharacterization. Finally, both the qualitative and quality-free\nvarieties may differ in terms of how closely related the primary and\nsecondary meanings are. Mukula describes highly conventional language\nuse as cases of “absorption”—for instance, using the\nterm “ruler” for to someone who is not from the ruling\nclass (so not strictly a ruler), but who performs the functions a\nruler does (such as protecting of people). In contrast, metaphors such\nas “The person is an ox” are not absorption, but\nsuperimposition, since some difference is understood. (See Keating\n2019, Cuneo 2020, and McCrea 2008 for further discussion of Mukula and\nĀnandavardhana on these topics.) \nAll of these varieties of secondary meaning require three conditions.\nFirst, there must be an obstacle in the primary meaning of the words.\nSecond, there must some relationship—of which kind, more\nbelow—between the primary and secondary meaning. Third, there\nmust be a warrant for the secondary meaning, such as a motivation on\nthe speaker’s part or some accepted conventional sense. To take\na stock example, “Feed the sticks,” which means\n“Feed the brahmins holding the sticks,” word\n“sticks” refers to something which is inanimate and which\ncannot be fed. Thus, the first condition is met—an obstacle to\nwhat is called “semantic fit” (yogyatā)\nwhich is necessary for a unified sentence. Second, there is a\nrelationship of association between brāhmin priests and\nsticks—they carry walking sticks. Association is not the only\npossible relationship between primary and secondary meaning, but it is\none, and it fulfills the second condition. Finally, a speaker using\nthis phrase would be trading on a conventionalized use, and thus meets\nthe third condition, of warrant. \nWhile this three-fold set of conditions is commonly accepted, given\ndifferent analyses of primary word-meaning, the boundary between\nprimary and secondary meaning will be drawn differently. For instance,\nBhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsakas, who take the\nprimary word-meaning to be a universal, find cases of secondary\nmeaning more pervasive than Nyāya philosophers, for whom\nword-meaning in the primary sense is more flexible. Given the command,\n“A cow is to be tied up,” the correct thing to do is to\nfind some single cow to fasten to a post. However,\nMīmāṃsakas such as Kumārila argue that the\nprimary meaning of “cow” in the command is cowhood,\nwhich cannot be fastened to a post. Thus\nthere is an obstacle to the semantic fit of the sentence. To resolve\nthis difficulty, Kumārila invokes the secondary meaning function\nknown as indication (lakṣaṇā), on which see\nMcCrea 2020. In TV 1.3.10, he argues\nthat indication causes hearers to understand that an individual cow is\nmeant. Hearers understand this from the knowledge that\n“cow” means cowhood, that\nindividual cows are qualified by cowhood, and\nyet that the sentence is uttered for the purpose of fulfilling\nsacrificial aims. Thus the relationship between the primary and\nsecondary meanings here is inherence (a universal inheres in an\nindividual), and the speaker aims to pick out a particular cow. \nOne of the central categories of secondary meaning is those meanings\nwhich have similarities with the primary meaning. For instance,\nKumārila takes qualitative expression\n(gauṇavṛtti), figures based on similarities, to\nbe one of the two major types of secondary meaning, where indication\n(lakṣaṇā) is a catch-all category for\nfigures based on any other kind of relationship. The figure of speech\nwhich rhetorical traditions tracing back to ancient Greece call\n“metaphor” would fall under qualitative expression,\nalthough Indian thinkers generally focus on the logical structure\nunderlying figures rather than a syntactic structure by which metaphor\nis often characterized (Gerow 1971).\nKumārila discusses the common example “Devadatta is a\nlion,” saying that when people hear the utterance, they find the\nword “lion” to be inexplicable as referring to Devadatta,\nand therefore conclude that the term must be used figuratively.\nHowever, while some thinkers would describe metaphors as involving a\nsuperimposition of lion on Devadatta, Kumārila explicitly rejects\nthis analysis, saying that all that is meant is that there are similar\nproperties that the two have, such as bravery. Otherwise,\nsuperimposition would mean there is confusion about the genuine\ndifference between people and lions. \nOne might object that the three examples just given: “Feed the\nsticks,” “A cow is to be tied up,” and\n“Devadatta is a lion” do not all have the same kind of\nobstacle. Philosophers, in the Aesthetic discipline and elsewhere,\nwork to make the nature of this obstacle precise. While initially the\nemphasis is on the semantic connection within the sentence itself, for\nNyāya and Mīmāṃsā both, by the time of\nMaṇḍana Miśra (ca seventh century CE) and\nVācaspati Miśra (ca tenth century CE), the failure is taken\nto be wider, including problems with the larger context. In the ninth\ncentury work of Mukula Bhaṭṭa, such a widening is apparent\nas he distinguishes between multiple features of context which may\nrequire a word to be taken in a secondary sense: a speaker, sentence,\ntime, place, and circumstance. Sometimes there is a clash between a\nspeaker and a sentence meaning, as in the case taken from courtly love\npoetry—a common source of linguistic examples—where a\nyoung woman utters words, “I go alone to the forest along the\nriverbank” to a neighbor. She is to be understood as conveying\nthe opposite (she is not going alone) to her neighbor, but intending\nher husband to overhear and to believe she is telling the truth. Since\nwe know facts (through the poetic context or genre) about the\nwoman’s personal life, Mukula argues that the sentence cannot be\ntaken to mean the literal truth. \nAn important phenomenon in Indian poetry, double meaning\n(śleṣa), garnered the attention of philosophers of\naesthetics and, to a lesser extent, philosophers and grammarians. At\nits most basic level, the figure involves using a single word in two\nor more different senses. It is akin to “punning” but\nwithout the connotation of triviality that often accompanies puns,\nhence the term “bitextuality” (Bronner\n2010). In fact, according to\nRudraṭa, in his Ornaments of Poetry\n(Kāvyālaṅkāra, ca 855 CE), bitextuality\nis the perfect figure of speech (Gerow\n1977). The phenomenon in Sanskrit was not limited to a word or\ntwo, here and there, but entire compositions were written which admit\nof two different meanings. One of the most prominent examples is of\npoems which, read one way tell the story of the\nRāmāyaṇa, and read another way, narrate the\nMahābhārata. Examples are difficult to translate\ninto English, since they rely on particularities of Sanskrit: word\nbreaks which are frequently joined together, the ubiquity of\ncompounds, and the fact of phonemic transformation at phonetic\nboundaries (saṃdhi) which can be reconstructed in\nmultiple ways. For instance, dāsyasītyuktvā\ncan be disambiguated as dāsy asīty uktvā\n(saying, “you are my slave”) or dāsyasīty\nuktvā (saying [to myself] “you will give!”)\n(Bronner 2010: xvii). \nThis particular linguistic device is not merely a figurative ornament,\nbut is at the center of a major intellectual and literary movement.\nPoetic lexicons exist which contain stipulated meanings for syllables.\nThese assist poets in creating bitextual compositions. Poetic\ncommentaries tease out the multiplicities inherent in poems, whether\nor not they are intended by the author. Bronner\n(2010) identifies several ways in which the existence of\nbitextuality was a sticking point for theorists trying to give an\naccount of word-meaning and the relationship between meaning and\naesthetics. First, there is the difficulty of identifying a particular\nlogical structure underpinning bitextuality. Second, there is the\nquestion of whether bitextuality’s effects are due to\nword-meaning or to the sounds of words. Finally, there is the problem\nof the psychology of bitextuality. \nOne reason that bitextuality resists explanation is that the multiple\n“registers” (ways of reading the text), such as the story\nof the Rāmāyaṇa and the\nMahābhārata mentioned above, are not merely two\ndistinct sets of unrelated meanings. Rather, similes or metaphors\nfrequently connect the readings. For instance,\nDhanañjaya’s “Poem of Two Targets,” through\nsetting the Rāmāyaṇa and the\nMahābhārata “side-by-side” allows the\nreader to contrast the protagonists of the two epics (Bronner\n2010: 110). Further, even where such\nrelationships are not obvious, given the important principle that\nnon-literal utterances must be supported by some warrant, whether\nconventional or due to speaker aims, most Sanskrit thinkers argued\nthat no one would utter a sentence with two meanings that are\nunrelated. Mahima Bhaṭṭa (11th century CE), in\nhis Analysis of “Manifestation”\n(Vyaktiviveka), argues that paranomasia, as a kind of\nmeaning, must be coherent in the sense of having semantic fit, even\nif, as a kind of secondary meaning, there are cues which lead the\nreader to go beyond the strictly literal sense. However, unlike cases\nof metaphor, where there is an obstacle to semantic fit, as in\n“Devadatta is a lion,” bitextuality requires that there be\n(at least) two sets of coherent meanings which have semantic fit and\nalso that there be a way to bring both meanings together. Further,\nsince the trigger for bitextuality cannot be a failure of semantic\nfit, there must be some cue other than just the mere possibility of\nreading a sentence in two ways (McCrea\n2008). Ānandavardhana, however, who comes two centuries\nbefore Mahima Bhaṭṭa, argues that there may be bitextual\npoems in which two sets of meanings do not cause a further metaphor or\nsimile (Bronner 2010: 204; McCrea\n2008: 434). \nĀnandavardhana argues for a new linguistic capacity, suggestion\n(dhvani or vyañjanā), which he believes\naccounts for important phenomena not included within existing theories\nof secondary meaning. His commentator, Abhinavagupta, elaborates on\nthis theory, though in a way which goes beyond\nĀnandavardhana’s original text, and he also writes his own\nindependent treatise on the topic. As a result of these two thinkers\n(authoring the Light on Suggestion and The Eye,\nrespectively), a new debate opens. It centers on whether existing\ntheories of language can account for the subtleties of meaning found\nin literature, such as courtly poetry, drama, and great epics. Those\nwho agree that suggestion must be accepted discuss what kinds of\nsuggested meaning ought to be adduced; those who reject suggestion\ngenerally try to show that for each putative category of suggested\nmeaning, an equivalent explanation can be given, through\nalready-accepted processes such as indication or inferential\nreasoning. This discussion is not much taken up in philosophical\ncircles in the Classical period. For instance, the Nyāya\nphilosopher Jayanta Bhaṭṭa (ca ninth century CE) has a\nstray remark disparaging suggestion in his Flower Garland of\nLogic (Nyāyamañjarī) but does not\nengage substantively with arguments for it. \nĀnandavardhana proceeds by citing passages which are generally\naccepted to have various kinds of poetic effects, and then analyzing\nhow these effects are attained by suggestion. He divides the content\nof what is suggested into implied meanings, implied figures, and\naesthetic moods (rasa). He also distinguishes among varieties\nof suggested meaning according to other criteria such as the\nspeaker’s intention, how rapidly the hearer recovers the\nsuggested content, and whether expressions or phonemes are the basis\nfor what is suggested. When suggestion is a way of conveying the\nrasa, the dominant aesthetic mood described or intimated\nwithin a poem, it is called rasa-dhvani. Ānandavardhana\ntries to give an account of when it is that suggestion causes poetic\nbeauty, and argues that rasa is the proper aim of all poetry.\nIt is important to mark that, for Ānandavardhana, rasa\nis found within the text, and not the reader. The reader simply comes\nto have a cognition of the text’s rasa. Thus it is\neasily understood as meaning, and not a reader’s emotional\nstate. After Abhinavagupta’s commentary on Ānandavardhana,\nthe emphasis shifts onto the reader’s emotive experience, and\nhow to understand rasa in relation to other kinds of meaning\nbecomes more difficult. Even though many things may be suggested\n(figures of speech, facts), the ultimate aim of dhvani or\nsuggestion in the poetic context is to suggest rasa. \nTake the case of “The village is on the Ganges.” Here,\nĀnandavardhana argues that suggestion operates after both primary\nand secondary meaning. What is suggested is the purity of the village\nwhich is on the bank of the holy Ganges river. Note, though, that he\ndoes not think that both primary and secondary meaning are always\nnecessary for suggestion. For instance, the word “Ganges”\nitself could suggest purity without being in a metaphorical or\notherwise figurative context (here, it is metonymical for the bank).\nĀnandavardhana also contrasts the function of suggestion with the\nprimary meaning function. As for the latter, he says the relationship\nbetween the composition of words in a sentence and its primary meaning\nis a “natural relation.” The sense in which the\nword–referent relation is “natural” is that it is\nfixed. A word’s primary meaning is that meaning which is\ncognized in every single instance the word is employed. Suggestion, in\ncontrast, is an “artificial relation” since it is a\nmeaning that is not given by its natural word, and the relationship\nbetween suggested meaning and a suggestive word is not\none–to–one. \nOn Ānandavardhana’s view, the suggested meaning is a\nfurther step beyond the secondary meaning, but is not always\nunderstood through what is secondarily meant. For example, what is\nsuggested in this case is understood through the primary meaning of\n“Ganges,” since it is the river and not the bank which is\nassociated with suggested properties (specified as its purity and\ncoolness, according to later thinkers). The crucial aspect of\nĀnandavardhana’s view is that while secondary meaning\nrequires a failure of semantic fit, suggestion does not. A\nhearer’s understanding of “on the Ganges” as meaning\n“on the bank of the Ganges” is necessary in order for the\nsentence not to cause a cognition of a village as floating upon the\nGanges. In contrast, the suggested sense does not rectify any apparent\nsemantic incompatibility in the literal meaning of the sentence. \nWhile one can present a definitive number of types of suggestion\n(Abhinavagupta says there are thirty-five), Ānandavardhana\nhimself says there are an endless number of combinations if we take\ninto account all of the facts involved in creating suggested meaning.\nWhether this should be taken literally or as a rhetorical flourish,\nthe point is that Ānandavardhana does not view his analysis as a\ncomplete taxonomy of suggested meaning. In keeping with this spirit,\nonly a few of the important divisions are discussed below. \nĀnandavardhana subdivides suggestion in two ways based on two\nkinds of intentions a speaker has with regard to the expression she\nutters. This is consistent with his view that underlying all cases of\nsuggestion there is a purpose (prayojana) the speaker has in\nchoosing a particular expression. In particular, these intentions are\ndefined in terms of the speaker’s attitude towards the primary\nmeaning of an expression. First, a speaker may intend to convey the\nprimary meaning plus some suggested meaning. Second, she may not\nintend to convey the primary meaning, but only have an intention to\nconvey a suggested meaning. \nAs an example of the first type, Ānandavardhana cites love poetry\nwritten by the Buddhist philosopher Dharmakīrti (ca\n6th to 7th century CE, see the entry on\n Dharmakīrti).\n The poem describes images of birds and fruit which are meant to be\ntaken literally. However, these images are juxtaposed in a way which\nsuggests an additional sense consistent with the romantic tone of the\npoem. There is no explicit comparison between the images, but the\ncomparison is suggested. This kind of suggestion is something like the\nphenomenon in Ezra Pound’s famous imagist poem, “In a\nStation of a Metro” \nThe apparition of these faces in the crowd;\n\nPetals on a wet, black bough. (Pound\n1913) \nThere is no linguistic metaphor in the sense of an explicit\npredication between two things, such as faces and petals. However, the\nreader understands an implicit comparisons between the two images.\nThus there is both primary and suggested meaning. Other times,\nĀnandavardhana says, the speaker intends only to convey a\nsuggested meaning, so the primary meaning may be entirely replaced or\nset aside in some manner. For example, in this passage from the\nRāmāyaṇa, the phrase “blinded” is\nnot being used in a primary sense, but in a suggestive manner: \nThe sun has stolen our affection for the moon,\n\nwhose circle is now dull with frost\n\nand like a mirror blinded by breath,\n\nshines no more. (DL: 209) \nSince a mirror cannot, strictly speaking, be made blind—breath\nmerely fogs it—this is a case where the speaker intends what is\nsuggested to replace the primary meaning. \nWhile the previous categories are distinguished by the speaker’s\naims, the two other categories are distinguished by the hearer’s\nexperience. Ānandavardhana says that when hearers come to\nunderstand the suggested meaning of a poem, they can do so either\ninstantaneously or else after a “reverberation”—some\nexperienced temporal gap between recovering the literal meaning and\nrecovering the suggested meaning. The suggested content characterized\nby reverberation may be similar to what contemporary philosophers talk\nabout in terms of the metaphorical “felt gap” between\nliteral and metaphorical meanings in particular (e.g., Camp\n& Reimer 2008). However, it also\nincludes the idea of a temporal gap between understanding the literal\nand suggested meaning. The phenomenological observation can, and\nshould, be distinguished from a claim about content recovery.\nĀnandavardhana does not appeal to the phenomenology of suggested\nmeanings as evidence that they are recovered in a certain way, though\nsuch a move was certainly available to him, as we have seen in\n section 1.2. \nĀnandavardhana categorizes a case of bitextuality\n(śleṣa) as involving reverberation, as both\nmeanings do not occur to the reader simultaneously. Further he\ndescribes this as a case where the sentence (rather than individual\nwords) suggests a second meaning, which comes like a\n“reverberation” or some time after the first. This\nsupports the idea that reverberation is about processing time, rather\nthan (or in addition to) a felt tension. Elsewhere,\nĀnandavardhana points out that for many kinds of suggestion,\nhearers do not have a “reverberation” or awareness of a\ngap between the primary meaning and what is suggested. Abhinavagupta\ngives an analogy to explain cases where there is no such\nreverberation. He says that when someone has taken to heart the\nrelationship between smoke and fire, she will be able to reason\ninferentially to the existence of fire simply on the perceptual basis\nof smoke. There need not be any awareness of inferential processes on\nthe part of the thinker. \nĀnandavardhana distinguishes in a number of other ways between\nvarieties of suggestion. He identifies the basis of suggestion: word\nmeanings, sentence meanings, discourse unit meanings, and even the\nsounds of individual phonemes can all give rise to suggested meaning.\nA poem’s entire “meaning,” that is, a comparison\nwhich may not be explicit in the poem, but is suggested throughout,\ncan itself be the basis for a suggested rasa, such as love or\nheroism. At a more local level, individual phonemes within a poem may\nalso suggest an aesthetic mood, through being sonorous or harsh, etc.\nThese distinctions within suggested meaning underscore the need for\ncaution in drawing equivalence between suggestion and analytic\nphilosophical concepts, such as implicature (see the entry on\n implicature)\n which is roughly analogous to, but not co-extensive with,\nĀnandavardhana’s dhvani, since Ānandavardhana\ndenies that suggestion arises through inferential reasoning. \nAlthough Ānandavardhana’s theory of suggested meaning was\ninfluential for many philosophers of aesthetics in the years following\nhis Light on Suggestion, not everyone accepted the new model.\nThere were two ways of rejecting suggestion: reducing it to a\nnon-linguistic capacity or reducing it to an already-existing\nlinguistic capacity—primary or secondary meaning. The first\nstrategy is followed, in different ways, by Bhaṭṭa\nNāyaka and Mahima Bhaṭṭa, whereas the second is\nfollowed by Mukula Bhaṭṭa and members of the\nPrābhākara school of Mīmāṃsā. \nIn his Mirror of the Heart, Bhaṭṭa Nāyaka\n(ca. 900 CE) argues that Ānandavardhana is mistaken to think of\nrasa as something like linguistic meaning, and instead\nfocuses on the emotional response of the reader (Pollock\n2016, Ollett\n2020). His argument is that rasa cannot be the kind of\nthing which is the meaning of a sentence—it is an experiential\nevent which is caused by sentences. Drawing on\nMīmāṃsā hermeneutics, which emphasizes how Vedic\nlanguage causes hearers to follow injunctions, Bhaṭṭa\nNāyaka proposes a multi-part process in which the primary meaning\nfunction operates in a normal manner, but subsequently there is what\nPollock calls an “aesthetic text-event” that unifies the\ndisparate parts of a poem through a generalizing power\n(bhāvakatva, De 1960 and\nPollock 2016). The audience has the\nability to enjoy (Pollock: “experientialize”) the result\nthrough a particular aesthetic capability (bhojakatva), and\nthe result is a transcendent, rapturous experience of rasa.\nThough understanding Nāyaka’s account is difficult, given\nsome textual problems, Ollett 2020\nargues that his idea of “actualizing” multiple parts of a\ntext has a parallel with the process by which we understand a unified\nsentence meaning from the parts of a sentence. While rasa is\nnot a linguistic meaning the way that a sentence meaning is, on this\nunderstanding, it, like sentence meaning, is something unified\nunderstood in dependence on multiple constituent parts. \nMahima Bhaṭṭa (ca. 1025 CE) does not consider\nrasa anything more than an emotion which has been stabilized\ninto the object of a particular kind of aesthetic enjoyment. His\nAnalysis of “Manifestation” argues that, since\nthe characters in a poem are unreal, the emotions they are\nexperiencing are also unreal, and must be inferred or imputed to them.\nAll of the talk of “manifesting” rasa is itself a\nfigure of speech, on Mahima Bhaṭṭa’s view. In\naddition, he argues that any putative “secondary meaning”\nsuch as indication (lakṣaṇā) is also\ninferred. Primary meaning plays an evidentiary role in inference based\non rules of pervasion (vyāpti) between the primary\nmeaning and secondary or suggested meaning. This position is\ncriticized by later thinkers, since the relationship between primary\nmeaning and these other meanings does not easily admit of\nuniversalizable regularities, and suggested meanings are often\ndefeasible (see the entry on\n logic in classical Indian philosophy\n for discussion of inference). \nLike Bhaṭṭa Nāyaka and Mahima Bhaṭṭa,\nMukula Bhaṭṭa agrees with Ānandavardhana that there\nare poetic phenomena that require explanation. He argues that these\nmeanings arise from the existing category of secondary meaning,\nindication (lakṣaṇā), rather than the third\nlinguistic capacity of suggested meaning. His Fundamentals of the\nCommunicative Function, through analysis of many of the stock\nexamples of suggestion in the Light on Suggestion, identifies\nthe necessary features which trigger indication: an obstacle in the\nprimary meaning, a relationship between the primary and indicated\nmeaning, and a motive or conventional basis for the indicated meaning.\nMukula argues that it is possible to have cases of indicated meaning\nwhich do not completely replace the primary meaning. Mukula’s\nwork comes to be widely influential through its incorporation into the\nIllumination of Poetry (Kāvyaprakāśa)\nwritten by later philosopher of aesthetics Mammaṭa, who excerpts\nparts of it verbatim (McCrea 2008). \nRather than explain suggested meaning as part of secondary meaning,\nthe Prābhākara school of Mīmāṃsā\nprefers to incorporate it into primary meaning. Their position, which\nis discussed in more detail below, criticizes the\nBhāṭṭa distinction between primary and secondary\nmeaning. On their view, word meanings do not—as per the\nBhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsā view—have a\nfixed primary meaning regardless of sentence context. Instead, the\nmeaning of a word will vary depending on its relationship with other\nwords in a given sentence. Thus a word can carry a putatively\n“suggested” meaning simply through force of context.\nĀnandavardhana himself implicitly criticizes this position,\narguing that suggested meaning function has a different object, since\nit does not result directly from the word, but from the primary\nmeaning of the word. For instance, the well-known case of “A\nvillage is on the Ganges” suggests the purity of the\nvillage—but this cannot be the primary meaning of the word\n“Ganges” even contextually. It is an additional meaning,\nconveyed subsequent to the ordinary meaning of “Ganges”\n(DL). \nNot all thinkers accept that there is a genuine difference between\nprimary and secondary meaning. The rejection of this distinction\nhappens in several different ways. First, and most radically, one\nmight flatten the distinction to the point at which all language is\nequally “non-literal,” and reject the idea that there is a\nfoundational stratus of meaning. This is the view of some Buddhists,\nalthough just how to cash out this idea is a significant question.\nSecond, one might argue that while there is a pragmatic reason to\ndistinguish between primary and secondary meaning, this distinction\ndoes not map onto any genuine facts about language or its relationship\nwith the world. Loosely, this is the view of Grammarian\nBhartṛhari, whose sphoṭa or “burst”\ntheory is that words are simply useful heuristics, but not real in any\nrobust sense. Finally, one might argue that word-meanings are highly\ncontext-dependent to the extent that it is not useful to think of a\nsingle “primary” meaning for a word. This is the position\nof Prābhākara Mīmāṃsakas who do, however,\nmake room for secondary meaning in a sense. \nBuddhism and Jainism, two so-called “heteroprax”\n(Veda-rejecting) traditions in India, put forward analyses of language\nwhich challenge the notion of a distinction between primary and\nsecondary meaning, at least as drawn in the orthoprax schools.\nSignificant textual work—as well as secondary\nscholarship—remains to be done in the area of how both of these\ntraditions (especially Jainism) understand language, but there are\nsome clear themes. \nBuddhist thinkers are broadly committed to error theories about\nordinary language use. As noted already, early Buddhists, in texts\nsuch as The Questions of King Milinda\n(Milindapañhā), argue for a kind of\nconventionalism: language which seems to refer to persistent whole\nobjects, such as chariots and persons, does not, as such objects are\ntaken to lack true existence. Later philosophical reflection, such as\nin the Commentary on the Treasury of Dharma\n(Abhidharmakośabhāṣya) of Vasubandhu (ca\nfourth to fifth century CE, see the entry on\n Vasubandhu),\n presents a kind of local\n fictionalism\n or reductionism, as the only truly existing things are atomic simples\nwhich exist momentarily. Thus, all language is, save for claims about\nultimately real constituent parts, loose speech. Buddhist philosophy\nof language is famous for its “two truths” doctrine (see\nthe entry on\n the theory of two truths in India),\n the notion that there is conventional truth and ultimate\ntruth—but this gets cashed out variously among the later schools\nsuch as Yogacāra and Madhyamaka (see Siderits 2003 and Garfield\n2006). \nA commitment to the ubiquitous nature of non-literal speech is seen\nexplicitly in Buddhist texts which pick up on the existing categories\nin Grammarian and Aesthetic thought, such as cognitive superimposition\nor metaphor (upacāra), and employ them to undermine the\northoprax theories of language which were realist and referential in\nnature (Gold 2007 and Tzohar 2018). For instance, the Yogacāra\nBuddhist Sthiramati, in his Commentary on the Thirty Verses\n(Triṃśikābhāṣya) (ca sixth century\nCE), cites a common Grammarian definition of upacāra,\nnoting that use of the term “self” and\n“things” is an instance of such figurative talk (Tzohar\n2018). Not only is the self, when talked about in apparently ordinary\nways, really being talked about indirectly, but this is so for all\nwords which, on Sthiramati’s Yogācāra view, refer to\nan individual’s conscious experience of qualities, and not\nthings in themselves. For Sthiramati, at least, there is a sense in\nwhich all language is “metaphorical,” though grounded in\nthe conscious arising and perishing of experiential events, rather\nthan a (putatively) objective external reality. \nAnother way in which this conventionalism plays out is in the\ndevelopment of the apoha theory of concepts, which has\nimportant implications for how language functions. The term\napoha means “exclusion.” This theory first\npresented in the work of fifth to sixth century CE philosopher\nDiṅnāga (see the entry on\n Dharmakīrti,\n and the discussion of the theory of apoha). The theory of\nexclusion is meant to explain how we can have conceptual connections\n(linguistic or otherwise) with the world even though, on this Buddhist\nview, reality is ultimately a series of unique, momentarily-existing,\nineffable particulars. Without universals or qualities, the Buddhists\nhave a difficulty explaining how talk of a “blue lotus,”\nfor instance, is possible. Their ingenious solution, much debated\nafter Diṅnāga, is to propose that we carve up the world\nconceptually by negation. Blueness is not a universal, but the\nexclusion of all non-blue particular things—it is to be\n“not non-blue.” How this theory works in detail is the\nsubject of Dharmakīrti’s work (ca sixth to seventh century\nCE) and a whole host of later thinkers, such as Ratnakīrti (ca\neleventh century CE). The philosopher of aesthetics Bhāmaha (ca\nsixth to seventh century CE) criticizes apoha in his\nOrnaments of Poetry\n(Kāvyālaṅkāra), but not with regard to\nany distinction between primary and secondary meaning. Rather, he\nargues that the sense of a word is positive, and that on\napoha, Buddhists are assigning two capacities to\nwords—exclusion and positive designation—when there is\nonly one (KB).\nMīmāṃsā and Nyāya philosophers likewise\ncriticize apoha extensively on these and similar grounds. \nBuddhist thought also takes up the distinction between kinds of\nmeaning in its approach to hermeneutics, with regard to the\ninterpretation of sūtra passages, not unlike the way in\nwhich Vedic hermeneutics both informs and is informed by\nMīmāṃsā philosophical reflection on language.\nBuddhist hermeneutics, despite its being positioned\n“outside” of the orthopraxy, employs lists of figures\nwhich pre-date the rise of the textual tradition of Sanskrit poetics,\nin a way which demonstrates that there were links between the\nGrammarian, Nyāya, Mīmāṃsā, and Buddhist\ntheories of meaning (Tzohar 2018). A\ncrucial concept in Buddhist hermeneutics, which approaches a\ndistinction between literal and non-literal, is that of\nupāya or “skillful means.” With the\nassumption that the Buddha speaks both truthfully and with an eye\ntowards the abilities of his particular audience, the notion of\n“skillful means” allows Buddhist hermeneuticists to\nexplain apparently contradictory elements within Buddhist texts. As\nwith Bhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsā use of\nsecondary meaning for Vedic interpretation, recourse to secondary\nmeaning in the face of apparent contradiction, skillful means allowed\nfor truth-preservation while constraining the interpretive\nprocess. \nOriginating with Mahāvīra, who lives around the same time as\nSiddhārtha Gautama, the founder of Buddhism (sixth century BCE),\nJainism is known for its emphasis on language’s representational\nlimitations. This is because of its view that reality is multi-faceted\n(anekāntavāda) and any single description will\nnecessarily involve some apparent contradiction, due to the fact that\nit is incomplete (Balcerowicz 2001).\nWithout relativization to a standpoint (naya), the sentences\n“o is P” and “o is\nnot-P” are contradictory. To address this, Jainas\npropose that there are seven ways to characterize any purported fact,\neach one preceded by a marker of uncertainty, syāt. Any\nobject o and its property P can be described as: \nThis seven-fold schema is found in many Jaina texts, from the early\nworks of Kundakunda (3rd to 6th centuries) up to\nthe to the important Flower Garland of Conditional\nPredication (Syādvādamañjarī) of\nMalliṣeṇa (13th century CE). While some, like\nPriest (2008), have argued that this\nseven-fold classification scheme lends itself to a\n paraconsistent\n (and perhaps also\n dialethic)\n formalization, it need not be, as within the scheme, each of the\nseven standpoints follows the law of non-contradiction, though within\na many-valued truth-system (Ganeri 2002;\nSchang 2013). On this interpretation,\nthe truth of an utterance is relativized to a particular context, in\nthe sense that each standpoint restricts the context, as Balcerowicz\nargues, through indices such as space, time, convention, and so on\n(Balcerowicz 2001). (Balcerowicz also\nquestions whether modern formalization is an eisegetical enterprise,\nreading into the text conceptions of axiomatization which were not\npresent; see Balcerowicz 2015.)\nMinimally, according to Siddharṣigaṇi (ca tenth century\nCE), one must include in one’s analysis of any given utterance\nthe speaker’s intention and the relevant linguistic connections\n(Clerbout, Gorisse, & Rahman 2018).\nThe schema, further, is hierarchically ordered, so that each\nstandpoint includes more indices than the prior, according to\nMalliṣeṇa (Balcerowicz\n2001). \nEmphasis on speaker’s intention is crucial for Jainas,\nespecially insofar as they hold to a division between two standpoints:\nthe ordinary standpoint (vyavahāranaya) and the\ntranscendent or ultimate standpoint (niścayanaya,\npāramārthikanaya). Ultimately speaking, language\ncannot be said to have any inherent communicative power, but rather it\nfunctions due to the speaker’s authority and position as having\nunmediated access to the truth. In fact, the Jainas hold that\nscriptures containing the words of Mahāvīra are not\nefficacious due to the words themselves—a stark contrast to the\nMīmāṃsā view of an unauthored Veda—but due\nto a unique suggestive power as well as the religious purity of the\nlistener. As a result of these principles, any single utterance is\nsusceptible to a number of different analyses. Flügel\n(2010) distinguishes between four\nkinds of analysis in Jaina thinking about language: \nThe existence of normative criteria governing language use, aiming at\nthe avoidance of harm (ahiṁsā) and the\npreservation of truth (satya) can be compared to Gricean\nconversational maxims, although the intentional flouting of these\nprinciples does not lead to conversational implicatures. In fact,\nJaina doctrines discourage ambiguity and emphasize precise speech\n(Flügel 2010). \nIn their explanation of word-meaning, Prābhākara\nMīmāṃsakas emphasize the relationship of words with\none another in a token utterance. Śālikanātha (ca.\n7th century CE), in his Monograph in Five Chapters\n(Prakaraṇapañcikā), argues that, to avoid\nmultiplying denotative capacities for words in different contexts, one\nshould posit the ability for words to denote meanings-in-relation.\nThis position is called “denotation of what is related”\n(anvitābhidhāna) and it is opposed to the\nBhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsā analysis\ndiscussed earlier (abhihitānvaya). The principle of\nparsimony is central to Prābhākara arguments. On the\nBhāṭṭa view, there are multiple levels of meaning and\na complex process of moving from a word to a word meaning to a unified\nsentence which connects those meanings. Śālikanātha\nargues that it would be better to explain the resultant connections\n(anvaya) among word meanings as being understood directly\nfrom the word. The idea that the same operation is responsible for\nunifying the word meanings into a sentence anticipates, to a degree,\nFrege’s idea of word meanings as unsaturated entities, although\nŚālikanātha is not thinking in the same ontological\nterms (see the discussion of semantic power and the reduction of\nsemantic properties in the entry on\n analytic philosophy in the entry on early modern India,\n and Siderits 1991). \nPrābhākara thinkers deny that the meaning of a\n“cow” is a universal and that indication is necessary to\nshift the generic referent of the noun to a particular.\nŚālikanātha argues that while it may be true that\nsomething the same is remembered in each case when someone says\n“cow,” this remnant of memory is not the same thing as a\nword meaning (PS: 381ff, Ollett\n2020b). Meaning has to do with the role\nthat a word’s cognition plays within a sentence. Further, he\nargues that a word conveys the universal and the particular together,\nsince the first cannot be understood without the second. So, while he\nagrees with the Bhāṭṭas that a series of universals\ncannot be connected together in a qualificative relationship, he\nconcludes that this is a reason to reject the view that words\nprimarily communicate generalities (sāmānya),\narguing that they must communicate a qualified thing\n(viśeṣana). \nHowever, Śālikanātha does leave room for the\ndistinction between primary and secondary meaning in cases like\n“The village is on the Ganges” and “The boy is a\nlion.” He argues that where the ordinary meaning of words cannot\nform a connective relationship then there is recourse to secondary\nmeaning. So in the case of words like “Ganges” and\n“lion,” the meaning–in–relation which is in\nconnection with other word meanings is the secondary meaning, not the\nprimary meaning. Despite this allowance for a distinction, the\nPrābhākara view is often touted as a radically contextualist\napproach. For instance, Abhinavagupta, who lived after the highly\ninfluential Śālikanātha, characterizes the\nPrābhākara position as one on which there is no distinction\nbetween primary meaning, secondary meaning, or suggestion. He says\nthat their view is that the meaning of the word is simply its final\nresult (1.4b The Eye, DL). He\npoints, however, out that the Prābhākara\nMīmāṃsā must accept different kinds of statements\nin the Vedas for exegetical purposes—some more direct than\nothers—and thus they should have no problem in principle\nallowing for suggested meaning. \nPrābhākaras emphasize three concepts in their account of\nword and sentence meaning: expectancy\n(ākāṅkṣā), cognitive proximity\n(sannidhi), and semantic fittingness (yogyatā).\nDepending on the word’s role in a sentence, it will have\ndifferent expectancies. This expectancy also varies depending on which\nword meanings are presented to the subject’s mind as candidates\nfor connection—or which meanings have cognitive proximity (these\nmay not be words which uttered in sequence, as a connected subject and\nverb may be separated by a dependent clause). Finally, the goal of a\nsentence is to convey something meaningful, so the word meanings in\nrelation must work together semantically: a sentence such as\n“Sprinkle the garden with fire” would fail to have\nsemantic fittingness. These three criteria determine what the\nmeaning-in-relations are which result in a sentence. Secondary meaning\nis resorted to when there is no relation possible\n(anvayānupapatti), such as when the word\n“village” cannot be related to “on the\nGanges,” since this expression would lack semantic fittingness.\nThese three concepts are not restricted to Prābhākaras,\nhowever, but are discussed and refined in various ways by nearly all\nof the intellectual traditions treating language (see\n section 5.1). \nIn his Treatise on Sentences and Words, the grammarian\nBhartṛhari (ca. 450 CE) takes up the distinction between primary\nand secondary meaning in more detail than previous grammarians such as\nPāṇini and Patañjali. His work is difficult—he\nis aware of, and engages with, Buddhist, Jaina, and\nMīmāṃsā views of language, but not in a\nstraightforward dialectical manner, as is the style of many other\nIndian thinkers. This causes controversy over his established views\n(for discussion of which see Cardona 1999). In terms of his position\non the division between primary and secondary meaning, the\ninterpretive debate centers on the implications of the\nsphoṭa-theory for the possibility of such a\ndistinction. \nIn Bhartṛhari’s work, the term sphoṭa,\nmeaning “burst,” refers to the indivisible nature of the\nutterance—it is a sound which carries meaning, and which cannot\nbe subdivided into words or particular phonemes. (One might think here\nof Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations, e.g.,\n1953 [2001]: 191, and the idea of grasping meaning in a\n“flash”—and indeed, this connection has been\nexplored in Bhattacharyya 2002 and\nelsewhere.) On one prevailing understanding of sphoṭa,\nBhartṛhari is committed to a kind of linguistic monism, which\nnot only denies the divisibility of utterances into grammatical\ncategories, but asserts the identity of speech and reality. Thus any\napparent distinctions between categories—letters, words,\nsemantic powers—are illusory. He uses common examples of\nillusion in Indian philosophy to underscore this point: from far away,\na large tree may look like an elephant; at a glance, a rope may appear\nto be a snake. However, these are misperceptions, as are the putative\nsemantic distinctions we make (Raja\n1969). \nJan E.F. Houben, in his translation of the “Exposition on\n(Semantic) Relationship” (Sambandhasamuddeśa)\nchapter of the Treatise, which treats figurative language\nextensively, argues that Bhartṛhari does distinguish between\nprimary and secondary meaning, but on pragmatic grounds (Houben\n1995). Houben thinks that\nBhartṛhari is a linguistic perspectivist, in the sense that his\nconcern is not to argue against any particular philosophical position,\nbut to show the limits of formal analysis itself. On this view, when\nBhartṛhari appeals to the analogy with perceptual illusion, it\nis merely to dismantle the commitment to a certain theory of\nreference: that which presupposes words refer to external reality.\nRecently, Tzohar has argued that Bhartṛhari holds a\n“pan-figurative” account, on which all words\n“figuratively signify” (Tzohar\n2018: 70). On this view, word reference does not require a\nrelationship with external referents. In contrast, all language use is\n“figurative” in the sense that it does not require\ncorrespondence. This interpretation incorporates but goes beyond\nHouben’s perspectivism, drawing out implications for the limits\nof language in connecting with reality. \nOn the linguistic monism view, Bhartṛhari is anticipating later\nAdvaita Vedānta monism, on which empirical reality is illusory\nand Brahman, without having any genuine properties, is the basis for\nthis illusion. His linguistic analysis, however, need not rely on\nthese metaphysical assumptions in order to underscore the centrality\nof the sentence for meaning. Saying that grammatical categories and\nstable word-meanings are constructed (kalpita) based on\ntheoretical needs, is to observe the priority of ordinary use and the\nrole of context for actual communication. The perspectivist\ninterpretation emphasizes the epistemic elements in\ntheory-construction, understanding the analogical argument from\nillusion as less concerned with error than the pragmatic grounds to\nour judgments. \nDifferent positions on the distinction between primary and secondary\nmeaning have implications for related philosophical topics. In the\nrealm of philosophy of language, theories of sentence meaning depend\non how word meaning is understood. Within philosophy of religion,\nscriptural hermeneutics is also contingent upon approaches to meaning.\nFinally, there are normative implications for speaking and producing\nworks of poetry, given the distinction. \nWhile much of the discussion about primary and secondary meaning is\ncentered on words, there are significant implications for sentence\nmeaning. Among those who accept the genuine compositionality of\nsentences, contra the sphoṭa theorists above,\nthere are two theories of how words combine in context to convey a\nunified meaning which differ over the role of secondary meaning. \nOn the “connection of denoted meanings” view\n(abhihitānvāya) accepted by Bhāṭṭa\nMīmāṃsakas, words convey their meanings, and then, in\nconjunction with three conditions, these meanings are related together\nthrough secondary meaning (lakṣaṇā). The\nthree conditions mentioned in\n section 4.3\n are expectancy of connections\n(ākāṅkṣā), semantic fit\n(yogyatā), and cognitive contiguity\n(āsatti or sannidhi). Expectancy of connections\nis defined either syntactically or in terms of a hearer’s\npsychological state of desiring words to fit together. Semantic fit is\nthe requirement that the sentence makes sense, prima facie,\nand contiguity is the requirement that words are uttered in a\ntemporally adjacent sequence or that they are closely related in the\nhearer’s mind. The view that the meaning of a sentence is due to\nthe secondary signification of words is not necessarily connected to\nBhāṭṭa view that words denote universals, as\nVācaspati, in his Drop of Truth (Tattvabindu),\ndefends this position despite elsewhere subscribing to Nyāya\ntheories of meaning. Vācaspati argues explicitly that indication\nis responsible for the relationship (anvaya) between\nword-meanings and argues that it is commensurate with a Naiyāyika\nposition (Sastri 2014; Phillips\n2015). \nIn favor of this view, its defenders observe that there must be some\ncommon word-meaning among sentences such as “Bring the\ncow,” “See the cow,” “Bring the sheep,”\nand “See the sheep” in order for hearers to understand\nwhat is being communicated. What we learn as language-users, through\ntrial and error and association of these various sentences with the\nworld, is the invariable meaning of the words. Against this\n“connection of denoted meanings” view,\nŚālikanātha and other Prābhākara\nphilosophers, as discussed earlier, argue that what is remembered on\nhearing an individual word does not constitute a genuine meaning\nwithout its being connected to the other words—emphasizing the\ninferential element of meaning. Their view, the “designation of\nmeanings-as-connected” (anvitābhidhāna),\nrejects the role of secondary meaning as a sentence-unifier. \nJayanta Bhaṭṭa, a Nyāya philosopher, takes up a third\nposition, on which word-purport (tātparya) plays the\nunifying functional role. This sense of tātparya is\ndifferent from later uses of the term to mean speaker intention. His\ntheory of word-purport is accepted by Abhinavagupta who includes it in\nThe Eye 1.4 among his list of functions\n(vṛtti-s) of language: the primary, secondary,\nword-purport, and suggestion (Graheli\n2016). For both Jayanta and Abhinavagupta, the idea that the\nsecondary meaning function is also responsible for sentential unity\nwas unacceptable. Abhinavagupta summarizes the four capacities and\ntheir characteristics as \nThe crucial distinction between the “connection of denoted\nmeanings” view and the two others is whether the secondary\nmeaning function has a role to play before the sentence meaning is\nunderstood. Abhinavagupta explicitly says that it is not possible to\nhave an obstacle for primary meaning without first understanding the\nsyntactical connections among words. Thus secondary meaning can only\noccur after the capacity of purport. He distinguishes between\nnonsensical but syntactically acceptable sentences such as\n“There are a hundred elephants on the tip of my finger”\nand phrases which are syntactically faulty, “Ten pomegranates,\nsix pancakes” (DL: 1.4b L, page\n86). \nFinally, Mukula Bhaṭṭa identifies a theory, most likely\nhis own, which he calls “the combined view” (Keating\n2019). It takes secondary meaning to\napply both before and after sentence meaning. His understanding of\nsecondary meaning is broader than both Śālikanātha and\nAbhinavagupta, as it does not always replace the primary meaning. So\nit can play the role of purport and can also encompass the function of\nsuggestion. Thus, where the division between primary and secondary\nmeaning is made, and how secondary meaning is characterized has\nimportant consequences for all these views of sentence meaning. \nPrimary and secondary meaning, and the boundaries between them,\nfigured significantly in discussion over scriptural interpretation.\nThe topic is implicated in general discussions about how to approach\nhermeneutics, in particular by Mīmāṃsā and\nVedānta philosophers. Particular doctrinal or philosophical\npositions presented in, for example, the Upaniṣads or the Vedas,\nare subject to scrutiny based on whether they should be taken\nliterally or not. The Mīmāṃsā system of\nhermeneutics, as Rajendran (2001) and\nMcCrea (2008) have shown, subsequently\ncomes to influence the analysis of poetic meaning. \nWhile he is not a Mīmāṃsaka (he is called a\nsarva-tantra-sva-tantra, someone for whom all systems are his\nown), even Vācaspati, in his Drop of Truth mentioned\nabove, takes up the question of the impact of theories of secondary\nmeaning on the interpretation of the Vedas. He is a proponent of the\nview that indication acts as “glue,” metaphorically\nspeaking, and secures the relationship between word-meanings—but\nthis might threaten the possibility that the Vedas convey meaning\nsecondarily, since indication requires appeal to speaker intention to\nmake sense. This, says his opponent, threatens Vedic authority. While\nVācaspati’s initial dry remark is to say, well, so much for\nVedic authority, he steps back by postulating that the ordinary use of\nelders (vrddhavyavahāra) lets us understand, lacking a\ngenuine person who authors the words. He thus preserves the principle\nthat Vedic and ordinary language are cut from the same cloth, as both\nrequire indication for sentence meaning (Sastri\n2014; Phillips 2015). \nIn the Thorough Investigation of Truth\n(Tattvasamīkṣā), a commentary on\nMaṇḍana Miśra’s The Demonstration of\nBrahman (Brahmasiddhi), Vācaspati argues for the\ntruth of the Upaniṣadic claim of non-duality between self and\nreality, against an interlocutor who would interpret the\nUpaniṣads in a figurative manner. At stake is the role of\nlanguage in relationship to other sources of knowledge. The opponent\nobjects to the conflict between sense perception and the putatively\nordinary meaning of the Upaniṣads, since this would entail that\nsense perception—which delivers knowledge of a world apart from\nthe self—is flawed. They argue that, when such conflicts arise,\nperception should prevail, and a figurative meaning should be\npreferred. Vācaspati objects on a number of grounds, first noting\nthat there must be a relationship between a primary and secondary\nmeaning (one cannot simply leap to a secondary meaning when it is\nconvenient). Then he appeals to the principle already described in\ndetail—when it is not possible to interpret the ordinary meaning\nin a sensible manner, this is the impetus for secondary meaning.\nConflict with other knowledge sources is not the catalyst for\nfigurative interpretation\n(Vācaspatimiśra, VT:\n29–32). \nIn addition to contentful philosophical implications, the distinction\nbetween primary and secondary meaning has an impact on how philosophy\nis done. For instance, NS 1.2.10ff, in outlining the appropriate terms\nof philosophical debate, defines the flaw of casuistry\n(vimāṃsa) as misusing words to mislead one’s\nopponent. There are a number of types of casuistry, one of which is\nfigurative. Vātsyāyana, in his commentary (NBh 1.2.14),\ncites one of the stock examples of secondary meaning of the indicative\ntype: “The stands are shouting.” Here, where the meaning\nis that people seated on wooden structures are shouting, it would be\ncasuistry to reply, “No, the stands are not shouting, but the\npeople are shouting.” This overly literal interlocutor pretends\nto misunderstand the speaker’s intention, and makes there to be\nconflict when there is none. Whether or not this kind of debate flaw\nis an importantly unique kind of casuistry (there is some discussion\nabout this in the commentaries), Nyāya philosophers emphasize\nthat verbal hair-splitting without charity towards one’s debate\nopponent constitutes a condemnable manner of intellectual speech (NS\n1.2.2, Todeschini 2010). \nWe have already seen in\n section 4.2\n that Jainas emphasize careful speech using the ordinary, not\nfigurative, meanings of words. Mīmāṃsā has a\nsimilar emphasis on correct speech, especially in the context of Vedic\nrituals. The utterances of mantras—parts of the Veda which\naccompany ritual practice—had to be performed precisely in order\nto guarantee the efficacy of the procedure (and mispronunciation in a\nritual context was equal to sinful lying). Thus the study of\ngrammatical rules was important, as these included pronunciation and\nmodification of words to fit a new context (declining nouns into the\nplural, adjusting utterances to incorporate different deity names, and\nso forth). Further, grammar was a corrective to ordinary use, which is\nonly an imperfect a guide to correct interpretation of Vedic words.\nDistinguishing between commands in the primary sense of words and\nfigurative language exhortations was also crucial for\nMīmāṃsā, since the proper interpretation of the\nlatter was relevant for the performance of the ritual. For example,\nthe exhortation, “The grass-bedding is the ritual patron”\n(TV 1.4.13) is a case of secondary meaning of the qualitative type\n(gauṇavṛtti), which praises the central role of\nthe ritual patron. Kumārila observes that misunderstanding this\nmeaning would lead to absurdity, since the grass-bedding (a woven mat\nof grass on which ritual implements are placed) is burned up—and\ntaking the phrase literally would mean putting an early stop to the\nritual process if the patron himself were burned (Harikai\n2017). \nFinally, Aesthetics interweaves normative implications throughout.\nPoetry is not merely for pleasure, but incorporates moral figures (one\nis instructed to be like Rāma, the hero of the\nRāmāyaṇa, and not like Rāvaṇa, the\nevil demon) and presupposes an entire moral structure. Abhinavagupta,\nin his independent works, takes up the theory of suggestion into the\nphilosophy of Kashmir Śaivism, a tantric tradition which devotes\nitself to the deity Śiva. For Abhinavagupta, rasa is not\nmerely an aesthetic phenomenon, but it is a profound sense of unity\nwith transcendent reality, found in the rasa of peacefulness\n(śānti) which encompasses all others. Still, one\nneed not go so far as Abhinavagupta’s work to see the normative\ndimension in Aesthetics, since even in Ānandavardhana’s\nmore ordinary understanding of rasa, there are certain\nemotions which are appropriate to bring into existence, and others\nwhich ought to be avoided. What is appropriate is dependent on the\ncharacter’s social position, gender, and so on. These norms also\nconstrain the interpretive possibilities of suggested meaning,\nproviding a conventional basis for the creative use of language.","contact.mail":"malcolm.keating@yale-nus.edu.sg","contact.domain":"yale-nus.edu.sg"}]
