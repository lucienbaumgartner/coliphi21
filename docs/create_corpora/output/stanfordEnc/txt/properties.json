Thus,\nproperties are often called predicables. Other terms for them\nare “attributes”, “qualities”,\n“features”, “characteristics”,\n“types”. Properties are also ways things are, entities\nthat things exemplify or instantiate. For example,\nif we say that this is a leaf and is green, we are attributing the\nproperties leaf and green to it, and, if the\npredication is veridical, the thing in question exemplifies these\nproperties. Hence, properties can also be characterized as\nexemplifiables, with the controversial exception of those\nthat cannot be instantiated, e.g., some would say, round and\nsquare. It is typically assumed that no other entities can be\npredicated and exemplified (Aristotle, Categories, 2a). For\nexample, ordinary objects like apples and chairs cannot be predicated\nof, and are not exemplified by, anything.\n\n\nThe nature and existence of properties have always been central and\ncontroversial issues in philosophy since its origin, and interest in\nthem keeps flourishing, as Allen’s (2016) recent introductory\ntext well testifies (see also surveys or anthologies such as Loux\n1972; Oliver 1996; Mellor and Oliver 1997; Koons and Pickavance 2017;\nMarmodoro and Mayr 2019). At least since Plato, who called them\n“ideas” or “forms”, properties are viewed as\nuniversals, i.e., as capable, (in typical cases) of being\ninstantiated by different objects, “shared” by them, as it\nwere; consequently, in contrast with particulars, or\nindividuals, of being somehow at once in different\n places.[1]\n For example, if there are two potatoes each of which weighs 300\ngrams, the property weighing 300 grams is instantiated by two\nparticulars and is therefore multi-located. According to a different\nconception, however, properties are themselves particulars, though\nabstract ones. As so conceived, properties are nowadays\ncommonly called\n tropes,\n and are the subject of another entry. Here we shall focus on\nproperties as universals. Relations, e.g., loving and\nbetween, can also be considered properties: they are\npredicable, exemplifiable, and viewable as universals. Accordingly, we\nuse “property” as a generic term that also covers them,\nunless the context suggests otherwise. However, we shall consider\ntheir peculiarity only to a minimum extent, since they are discussed\nin detail in the entry on\n relations.\n \n\nIn §1 we consider some most fundamental themes, including the\nmain motivations and arguments for including properties in one’s\nontology. In §2 we deal with the central topic of what it is for\nproperties to be exemplified. In §3 we tackle the intertwined\nissues of the existence and identity conditions for properties. In\n§4 we consider different senses in which properties may be\nstructurally complex. In §5 we survey the frequent appeal to\nproperties in current metaphysics of science. In §6 we conclude\nwith a review of formal accounts of properties and their applications\nin natural language semantics and the foundations of mathematics,\nwhich provide additional motivations for an ontological commitment to\nproperties.\n\nThere are some crucial terminological and conceptual distinctions that\nare typically made in talking of properties. There are also various\nsorts of reasons that have been adduced for the existence of\nproperties and different traditional views about whether and in what\nsense properties should be acknowledged. We shall focus on such\nmatters in the following subsections. \nProperties are expressed, as meanings, by\npredicates. In the past “predicate” was often\nused as synonym of “property”, but nowadays predicates are\nlinguistic entities, typically contrasted with singular\nterms, i.e., simple or complex noun phrases such as\n“Daniel”, “this horse” or “the President\nof France”, which can occupy subject positions in sentences and\npurport to denote, or refer to, a single thing.\nFollowing Frege, predicates are verbal phrases such as\n“is French” or “drinks”. Alternatively,\npredicates are general terms such as “French”,\nwith the copula “is” (or verbal inflection) taken to\nconvey an exemplification link (P. Strawson 1959; Bergmann 1960). We\nshall conveniently use “predicate” in both ways.\nPredicates are predicated of singular terms, thereby\ngenerating sentences such as “Daniel is French”. In the\nfamiliar formal language of first-order logic, this would be rendered,\nsay, as “\\(F(d)\\)”, thus representing the predicate with a\ncapital letter. The set or class of objects to which a predicate\nveridically applies is often called the extension of the\npredicate, or of the corresponding property. This property, in\ncontrast, is called the intension of the predicate, i.e., its\nmeaning. This terminology traces back to the Middle Age and in the\nlast century has led to the habit of calling sets and properties\nextensional and intensional entities, respectively.\nExtensions and intensions can hardly be identified; this is\nimmediately suggested by paradigmatic examples of co-extensional\npredicates that appear to differ in meaning, such as “has a\nheart”, and “has kidneys” (see\n §3.1). \nProperties can also be referred to by singular terms, or so it seems.\nFirst of all, there are singular terms, e.g., “being\nhonest” or “honesty”, that result from the\nnominalization of predicates, such as “is honest”\nor “honest” (some think that “being \\(F\\)” and\n“\\(F\\)-ness” stand for different kinds of property\n(Levinson 1991). Further, there are definite descriptions, such as\n“Mary’s favorite property”. Finally, though more\ncontroversially, there are demonstratives, such as “that shade\nof red”, deployed while pointing to a red object (Heal\n1997). \nFrege (1892) and Russell (1903) had different opinions regarding the\nontological import of nominalization. According to the former,\nnominalized predicates stand for a “correlate” of the\n“unsaturated” entity that the predicate stands for (in\nFrege’s terminology they are a “concept correlate”\nand a “concept”, respectively). According to the latter,\nwho speaks of “inextricable difficulties” in Frege’s\nview (Russell 1903: §49), they stand for exactly the same entity.\nMutatis mutandis, they similarly disagreed about other\nsingular terms that seemingly refer to properties. The ontological\ndistinction put forward by Frege is mainly motivated by the fact that\ngrammar indeed forbids the use of predicates in subject position. But\nthis hardly suffices for the distinction and it is dubious that other\nmotivations can be marshalled (Parsons 1986). We shall thus take for\ngranted Russell’s line here, although many philosophers support\nFrege’s view or at least take it very seriously\n(Castañeda 1976; Cocchiarella 1986a; Landini 2008). \nProperties are typically invoked to explain phenomena of philosophical\ninterest. The most traditional task for which properties have been\nappealed to is to provide a solution to the so-called “one over\nmany problem” via a corresponding “one over many\nargument”. This traces back at least to Socrates and Plato\n(e.g., Phaedo, 100 c-d) and keeps being rehearsed (Russell\n1912: ch. 9; Butchvarov 1966; Armstrong 1978a: ch. 7; Loux 1998:\nch.1). The problem is that certain things are many, they are\nnumerically different, and yet they are somehow one: they appear to be\nsimilar, in a way that suggests a uniform classification, their being\ngrouped together into a single class. For example, some objects have\nthe same shape, certain others have the same color, and still others\nthe same weight. Hence, the argument goes, something is needed to\nexplain this phenomenon and properties fill the bill: the objects in\nthe first group, say, all have the property spherical, those\nin the second red, and those in the third weighing 200\ngrams. \nRelatedly, properties have been called for to explain our use of\ngeneral terms. How is it, e.g., that we apply “spherical”\nto those balls over there and refuse to do it for the nearby bench? It\ndoes not seem to be due to an arbitrary decision concerning where, or\nwhere not, to stick a certain label. It seems rather the case that the\nrecognition of a certain property in some objects but not in others\nelicits the need for a label, “spherical”, which is then\nused for objects having that property and not for others. Properties\nare thus invoked as meanings of general terms and\npredicates (Plato, Phaedo, 78e; Russell 1912: ch.\n9). In contrast with this, Quine (1948; 1953 [1980: 11, 21, 131] )\ninfluentially argued that the use of general terms and predicates in\nitself does not involve an ontological commitment to entities\ncorresponding to them, since it is by deploying singular terms that we\npurport to refer to something (see also Sellars 1960). However, as\nnoted, predicates can be nominalized and thus occur as singular terms.\nHence, even if one agrees with Quine, nominalized predicates still\nsuggest the existence of properties as their referents, at least to\nthe extent that the use of nominalized predicates cannot be\nparaphrased away (Loux 2006: 25–34; entry on\n platonism in metaphysics, §4). \nAfter Quine (1948), quantificational idiom is the landmark of\nontological commitment. We can thus press the point even more by\nnoting that we make claims and construct arguments that appear to\ninvolve quantification over properties, with quantifiers reaching (i)\nover predicate positions, or even (ii) over both subject and predicate\npositions (Castañeda\n 1976).[2]\n As regards (i), consider: this apple is red; this tomato is red;\nhence, there is something that this apple is and this tomato also is.\nAs for (ii), consider: wisdom is more important than beauty; Mary is\nwise and Elisabeth is beautiful; hence, there is something that Mary\nis which is more important than something that Elisabeth is. \nQuantification over properties seems ubiquitous not just in ordinary\ndiscourse but in science as well. For example, the inverse square law\nfor dynamics and the reduction of temperature to mean molecular energy\ncan be taken to involve quantification over properties such as masses,\ndistances and temperatures: the former tells us that the attraction\nforce between any two bodies depends on such bodies’ having\ncertain masses and being at a certain distance, and the latter informs\nus that the fact that a sample of gas has a given temperature depends\non its having such and such mean kinetic energy. \nSwoyer (1999: §3.2) considers these points within a long list of\narguments that have been, or can be, put forward to motivate an\nontological commitment to properties. He touches on topics such as\na priori knowledge, change, causation, measurement, laws of\nnature, intensional logic, natural language semantics, numbers (we\nshall cover some of this territory in\n §5\n and\n §6). \nDespite all this, whether, and in what sense, properties should be\nadmitted in one’s ontology appears to be a perennial issue,\ntraditionally shaped as a controversy about the existence of\nuniversals. \nDo universals really exist? There are three long-standing answers to\nthis question: realism, nominalism, and\nconceptualism. \nAccording to realists, universals exist as mind-independent entities.\nIn transcendent realism, put forward by Plato, they exist\neven if uninstantiated and are thus “transcendent” or\n“ante res” (“before the things”). In\nimmanent realism, defended by Aristotle in opposition to his\nmaster, they are “immanent” or “in\nrebus” (“in things”), as they exist only if\ninstantiated by objects. Contemporary notable supporters are Russell\n(1912) for the former and Armstrong (1978a) for the latter (for recent\ntakes on this old dispute see the essays by Loux, Van Inwagen, Lowe\nand Galluzzo in Galluzzo & Loux 2015). Transcendentism is of\ncourse a less economical position and elicits epistemological worries\nregarding our capacity to grasp ante res universals.\nNevertheless, such worries may be countered in various ways (cf. entry\non\n platonism in metaphysics, §5;\n Bealer 1982: 19–20; 1998: §2; Linsky & Zalta 1995),\nand uninstantiated properties may well have work to do, particularly\nin capturing the intuitive idea that there are unrealized\npossibilities and in dealing with cognitive content (see\n §3).\n A good summary of pro-transcendentist arguments and immanentist\nrejoinders is offered by Allen (2016: §2.3). See also Costa\nforthcoming for a new criticism of immanentism, based on the\nnotion of grounding. \nNominalists eschew mind-independent universals. They may either resort\nto tropes in their stead, or accept predicate nominalism,\nwhich tries to make it without mind-independent properties at all, by\ntaking the predicates themselves to do the classifying job that\nproperties are supposed to do. This is especially indigestible to a\nrealist, since it seems to put the cart before the horse by making\nlanguage and mind responsible for the similarities we find in the rich\nvarieties of things surrounding us. Some even say that this involves\nan idealist rejection of a mind-independent world (Hochberg 2013).\nConceptualists also deny that there are mind-independent universals,\nand because of this they are often assimilated to nominalists. Still,\nthey can be distinguished insofar as they replace such universals with\nconcepts, understood as non-linguistic mind-dependent entities,\ntypically functioning as meanings of predicates. The mind-dependence\nof concepts however makes conceptualism liable to the same kind of\ncart/horse worry just voiced above in relation to predicate\n nominalism.[3] \nThe arguments considered in\n §1.2\n constitute the typical motivation for realism, which is the stance\nthat we take for granted here. They may be configured as an abductive\ninference to the best explanation (Swoyer 1999). Thus, of course, they\nare not foolproof, and in fact nominalism is still a popular view,\nwhich is discussed in detail in the entry on\n nominalism in metaphysics,\n as well as in the entry on\n tropes.\n Conceptualism appears to be less common nowadays, although it still\nhas supporters (cf. Cocchiarella 1986a: ch. 3; 2007), and it is worth\nnoting that empirical research on concepts is flourishing. \nWe have talked above in a way that might give the impression that\npredication is an activity that we perform, e.g., when we say\nor think that a certain apple is red. Although some philosophers might\nthink of it in this way, predication, or attribution, may\nalso be viewed as a special link that connects a property to a thing\nin a way that gives rise to\na propositions, understood as a complex\nfeaturing the property and the thing (or concepts of them) as\nconstituents with different roles: the latter occurs in the\nproposition as logical subject or argument, as is\noften said, and the former as attributed to such an argument.\nIf the proposition is true (the predication is veridical), the\nargument exemplifies the property, viz. the former is an instance of\nthe latter. The idea that properties yield propositions when\nappropriately connected to an argument motivates Russell’s\n(1903) introduction of the term\n“propositional\nfunction” to speak of properties. We\ntake for granted here that predication is univocal. However, according\nto some neo-Meinongian philosophers, there are two modes of\npredication, sometimes characterized as “external” and\n“internal” (Castañeda 1972; Rapaport 1978; Zalta\n1983; see entry on\n nonexistent objects).\n Zalta (1983) traces back the distinction to Mally and uses\n“exemplification” to characterize the former and\n“encoding” to characterize the latter. Roughly, the idea\nis that non-existent objects may encode properties that existent\nobjects exemplify. For instance, winged is exemplified by\nthat bird over and is encoded by the winged horse. \nIt is often assumed nowadays that, when an object exemplifies a\nproperty, there is a further, complex, entity, a fact or state of\naffairs (Bergmann 1960; Armstrong 1997, entries on\n facts\n and\n states of affairs),\n having the property (qua attributed) and the object\n(qua argument) as constituents (this compositional conception\nis not always accepted; see, e.g., Bynoe 2011 for a dissenting voice).\nFacts are typically taken to fulfill the theoretical roles of\ntruthmakers (the entities that make true propositions true, see entry\non\n truthmakers)\n and causal relata (the entities connected by causal\nrelations; see entry on\n the metaphysics of causation, §1).\n Not all philosophers, however, distinguish between propositions and\nstates of affairs; Russell (1903) acknowledges only propositions and,\nfor a more recent example, so does Gaskin (2008). \nIt appears that properties can have a double role that no other\nentities can have: they can occur in propositions and facts both as\narguments and as attributed (Russell 1903: §48). For example, in\ntruly saying that this apple is red and that red is a color, we\nexpress a proposition wherein red occurs as attributed, and\nanother proposition wherein red occurs as argument.\nCorrespondingly, there are two facts with red in both roles,\nrespectively. This duplicity grounds the common distinction between\ndifferent orders or types of properties:\nfirst-order ones are properties of things that are not\nthemselves predicables; second-order ones are properties of\nfirst-order properties; and so on. Even though the formal and\nontological issues behind this terminology are controversial, it is\nwidely used and is often connected to the subdivision between\nfirst-order and higher-order logics (see, e.g., Thomason 1974; Oliver\n1996; Williamson 2013; entry on\n type theory).\n It originates from Frege’s and Russell’s logical\ntheories, especially Russell’s type theory, wherein distinctions\nof types and orders are rigidly regimented in order to circumvent the\nlogical paradoxes (see\n §6). \nA relation is typically attributed to a plurality of objects. These\njointly instantiate the relation in question, if the\nattribution is veridical. In this case, the relata (as\narguments) and the relation (as attributed) are constituents of a\nstate of affairs. Depending on the number of objects that it can\nrelate, a relation is usually taken to have a number of\n“places” or a “degree” (“adicity”,\n“arity”), and is thus called “dyadic”\n(“two-place”), “triadic”\n(“three-place”), etc. For example, before and\nbetween are dyadic (of degree 2) and triadic (of degree 3),\nrespectively. In line with this, properties and propositions are\n“monadic” and “zero-adic” predicables, as they\nare predicated of one, and of no, object, respectively, and may then\nbe seen as limiting cases of relations (Bealer 1982, where properties,\nrelations and propositions are suggestively grouped under the acronym\n“PRP;” Dixon 2018; Menzel 1986; 1993; Swoyer 1998; Orilia\n1999; Van Inwagen 2004; 2015; Zalta 1983). This terminology is also\napplied to predicates and sentences; for example, the predicate\n“between” is triadic, and the sentence “Peter is\nbetween Tom and May” is zero-adic. Accordingly, standard\nfirst-order logic employs predicates with a fixed degree, typically\nindicated by a superscript, e.g., \\(P^1\\), \\(Q^2\\), \\(R^3\\), etc. \nIn natural language, however, many predicates appear to be\nmultigrade or variably polyadic; i.e., they can be\nused with different numbers of arguments, as they can be true of\nvarious numbers of things. For example, we say “John is lifting\na table”, with “lifting” used as dyadic, as well as\n“John and Mary are lifting a table”, with\n“lifting” used as triadic. Moreover, there is a kind of\ninference, called “argument deletion”, which also suggests\nthat many predicates that prima facie could be assigned a\ncertain fixed degree are in fact multigrade. For example, “John\nis eating a cake” suggests that “is eating” is\ndyadic, but since, by argument deletion, it entails “John is\neating”, one could conclude that it is also monadic and thus\nmultigrade. Often one can resist the conclusion that there are\nmultigrade predicates. For example, it could be said that “John\nis eating” is simply short for “John is eating\nsomething”. But it seems hard to find a systematic and\nconvincing strategy that allows us to maintain that natural language\npredicates have a fixed degree. This has motivated the construction of\nlogical languages that feature multigrade predicates in order to\nprovide a more appropriate formal account of natural language (Grandy\n1976; Graves 1993; Orilia 2000a). Since natural language predicates\nappear to be multigrade, one may be tempted to take the properties and\nrelations that they express to also be multigrade, and the metaphysics\nof science may lend support to this conclusion (Mundy 1989). \nSeemingly, relations are not jointly instantiated\nsimpliciter; how the instantiation occurs also plays\na role. This comes to the fore in particular with non-symmetric\nrelations such as loving. For example, if John loves Mary,\nthen loving is jointly instantiated by John and Mary in a\ncertain way, whereas if it is Mary who loves John, then\nloving is instantiated by John and Mary in another way.\nAccordingly, relations pose a special problem: explicating the\ndifference between facts, such as Abelard loves Eloise and\nEloise loves Abelard, that at least prima facie\ninvolve exactly the same constituents, namely a non-symmetric relation\nand two other items (loving, Abelard, Eloise). Such facts are\noften said to differ in “relational order” or in the\n“differential application” of the non-symmetric relation\nin question, and the problem then is that of characterizing what this\nrelational order or differential application amounts to. \nRussell (1903: §218) attributed an enormous importance to this\nissue and attacked it repeatedly. Despite this, it has been pretty\nmuch neglected until the end of last century, with only few others\nconfronting it systematically (e.g., Bergmann 1992; Hochberg 1987).\nHowever, Fine (2000) has forcefully brought it again on the\nontological agenda and proposed a novel approach that has received\nsome attention. Fine identifies standard and\npositionalist views (analogous to two approaches defended by\nRussell at different times (1903; 1984); cf. Orilia 2008). According\nto the former, relations are intrinsically endowed with a\n“direction”, which allows us to distinguish, e.g.,\nloving and being loved: Abelard loves\nEloise and Eloise loves Abelard differ, because they\ninvolve two relations that differ in direction (e.g., the former\ninvolves loving and the latter being loved).\nAccording to the latter, relations have different\n“positions” that can somehow host relata:\nAbelard loves Eloise and Eloise loves Abelard\ndiffer, because the two positions of the very same loving\nrelation are differently occupied (by Abelard and Eloise in one case\nand by Eloise and Abelard in the other case). Fine goes on to propose\nand endorse an alternative, “anti-positionalist”\nstandpoint, according to which relations have neither direction nor\npositions. The literature on this topic keeps growing and there are\nnow various proposals on the market, including new versions of\npositionalism (Orilia 2014; Donnelly 2016; Dixon 2018), and\nprimitivism, according to which differential application\ncannot be analyzed (MacBride 2014). \nRussell (1903: ch. 26) also had a key role in leading philosophers to\nacknowledge that at least some relations, in particular\nspatio-temporal ones, are external, i.e., cannot be reduced\nto monadic properties, or the mere existence, of the relata,\nin contrast to internal relations that can be so reduced. This was a\nbreakthrough after a long tradition tracing back at least to Aristotle\nand the Scholastics wherein there seems to be hardly any place for\nexternal relations (see entry on\n medieval theories of relations).[4] \nAccording to some philosophers, universals and tropes may coexist in\none ontological framework (see, e.g., Lowe 2006 for a well-known\ngeneral system of this kind, and Orilia 2006a, for a proposal based on\nempirical data from quantum mechanics). However, nowadays they are\ntypically seen as alternatives, with the typical supporter of\nuniversals (“universalist”) trying to do without tropes\n(e.g., Armstrong 1997) and the typical supporter of tropes\n(“tropist”) trying to dispense with universals (e.g.,\nMaurin\n 2002).[5]\n In order to clarify how differently they see matters, we may take\nadvantage of states of affairs. Both parties may agree, say, that\nthere are two red apples, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). They will immediately\ndisagree, however, for the universalist will add that \nThe tropist will reject these states of affairs with universals as\nconstituents and rather urge that there are two distinct tropes, the\nredness of \\(a\\) and the redness of \\(b\\), which play a theoretical\nrole analogous to the one that the universalist would invoke for such\nstates of affairs. Hence, tropists claim that tropes can be causal\nrelata (D. Williams 1953) and truthmakers (Mulligan, Simons, &\nSmith 1984). \nTropes are typically taken to be simple, i.e., without any\nsubconstituent (see Section 2.2 of the entry on\n tropes).\n Their playing the role of states of affairs with universals as\nconstituents depends on this: universals combine two functions, only\none of which is fulfilled by tropes. On the one hand, universals are\ncharacterizers, inasmuch as they characterize concrete\nobjects. On the other hand, they are also unifiers, to the\nextent that different concrete objects may be characterized by the\nvery same universal, which is thus somehow shared by all of them; when\nthis is the case, there is, according to the universalist, an\nobjective similarity among the different objects (see\n §1.2).\n In contrast, tropes are only characterizers, for, at least as\ntypically understood, they cannot be shared by distinct concrete\nobjects. Given its dependency on one specific object, say, the apple\n\\(a\\), a trope can do the work of a state of affairs with \\(a\\) as\nconstituent. But for tropes to play this role, the tropist will have\nto pay a price and introduce additional theoretical machinery to\naccount for objective similarities among concrete objects. To this\nend, she will typically resort to the idea that there are objective\nresemblances among tropes, which can then be grouped together in\nresemblance classes. These resemblance classes play the role of\nunifiers for the tropist. Hence, from the tropist’s point of\nview “property” is ambiguous, since it may stand for the\ncharacterizers (tropes) or for the unifiers (resemblance classes) (cf.\nentry on\n mental causation, §6.5).\n Similarly, “exemplification” and related words may be\nregarded as ambiguous insofar as they can be used either to indicate\nthat an object exemplifies a certain trope or to indicate that the\nobject relates to a certain resemblance class by virtue of\nexemplifying a trope in that\n class.[6] \nMany important and often controversial distinctions among different\nkinds of properties have been made throughout the whole history of\nphilosophy until now, often playing key roles in all sorts of disputes\nand arguments, especially in metaphysics. Here we shall briefly review\nsome of these distinctions and others will surface in the following\nsections. More details can be found in other more specialized entries,\nto which we shall refer. \nLocke influentially distinguished between primary and\nsecondary qualities; the former are objective features of\nthings, such as shapes, sizes and weights, whereas the latter are\nmind-dependent, e.g., colors, tastes,\nsounds, and smells. This contrast was already\nemphasized by the Greek atomists and was revived in modern times by\nGalileo, Descartes, and Boyle. \nAt least since Aristotle, the essential properties of an\nobject have been contrasted with its accidental properties;\nthe object could not exist without the former, whereas it could fail\nto have the latter (see entry on\n essential vs. accidental properties).\n Among essential properties, some acknowledge individual\nessences (also called “haecceities” or\n“thisnesses”), which univocally characterize a certain\nindividual. Adams (1979) conceives of such properties as involving,\nvia the identity relation, the very individual in question, e.g.,\nSocrates: being identical to Socrates, which cannot exist if\nSocrates does not exist. In contrast, Plantinga (1974) views them as\ncapable of existing without the individuals of which they are\nessences, e.g., Socratizing, which could have existed even if\nSocrates had not existed. See\n §5.2\n on the issue of the essences of properties themselves. \n Sortal properties are typically\nexpressed by count nouns like “desk” and “cat”\nand are taken to encode principles of individuation and persistence\nthat allow us to objectively count objects. For example, there is a\nfact of the matter regarding how many things in this room instantiate\nbeing a desk and being a cat. On the other hand,\nnon-sortal properties such as red or water do not\nallow us to count in a similarly obvious way. This distinction is\noften appealed to in contemporary metaphysics (P. Strawson 1959: ch.\n5, §2; Armstrong 1978a: ch. 11, §4), where, in contrast, the\ntraditional one between genus and\n species\n plays a relatively small role. The latter figured conspicuously in\nAristotle and in much subsequent philosophy inspired by him. We can\nview a genus as a property more general than a corresponding species\nproperty, in a hierarchically relative manner. For example, being\na mammal is a genus relative to the species being a\nhuman, but it is a species relative to the genus being an\nanimal. The possession of a property called differentia\nis appealed to in order to distinguish between different species\nfalling under a common genus; e.g., as the tradition has it, the\ndifferentia for being human is being rational (Aristotle,\nCategories, 3a). Similar hierarchies of properties, however\nwithout anything like differentiae, come with the distinction of\n determinables and determinates,\n which appears to be\nmore prominent in current metaphysics. Color properties provide\ntypical examples of such hierarchies, e.g., with red and\nscarlet as determinable and determinate, respectively. \nWe saw right at the outset that objects exemplify, or instantiate,\nproperties. More generally, items of all sorts, including properties\nthemselves, exemplify properties, or, in different terminology,\nbear, have or possess properties. Reversing\norder, we can also say that properties characterize, or\ninhere in, the items that exemplify them. There is then a\nvery general phenomenon of exemplification to investigate, which has\nbeen labeled in various ways, as the variety of terms of art just\ndisplayed testifies. All such terms have often been given special\ntechnical senses in the rich array of different explorations of this\nterritory since Ancient and Medieval times up to the present age (see,\ne.g., Lowe 2006: 77). These explorations can hardly be disentangled\nfrom the task of providing a general ontological picture with its own\ncategorial distinctions. In line with what most philosophers do\nnowadays, we choose “exemplification”, or, equivalently,\n“instantiation” (and their cognates), to discuss this\nphenomenon in general and to approach some different accounts that\nhave been given of it in recent times. This sweeping use of these\nterms is to be kept distinct from the more specialized uses of them\nthat will surface below (and to some extent have already surfaced\nabove) in describing specific approaches by different philosophers\nwith their own terminologies. \nWe have taken for granted that there is just one kind of\nexemplification, applying indifferently to different categories of\nentities. This monist option may indeed be considered the\ndefault one. A typical recent case of a philosopher who endorses it is\nArmstrong (1997). He distinguishes three basic\ncategories, particulars, properties or relations, and states of\naffairs, and takes exemplification as cutting across them: properties\nand relations are exemplified not only by particulars, but by\nproperties or relations and states of affairs as well. But some\nphilosophers are pluralist: they distinguish different kinds\nof exemplification, in relation to categorial distinctions in their\nontology. \nOne may perhaps attribute different kinds of exemplification to the\nabove-considered Meinongians in view of the different sorts of\npredication that they admit (see, e.g., Monaghan’s (2011)\ndiscussion of Zalta’s theory). A more typical example of the\npluralist alternative is however provided by Lowe (2006), who\ndistinguishes “instantiation”,\n“characterization” and “exemplification” in\nhis account of four fundamental categories: objects, and three\ndifferent sorts of properties, namely kinds (substantial universals),\nattributes and modes\n (tropes).[7]\n To illustrate, Fido is a dog insofar as it instantiates the\nkind dog, \\(D\\), which in turn is characterized by\nthe attribute of barking, \\(B\\). Hence, when Fido is barking, it\nexemplifies \\(B\\) occurrently by virtue of being\ncharacterized by a barking mode, \\(b\\), that instantiates \\(B\\); and,\nwhen Fido is silent, it exemplifies \\(B\\) dispositionally,\nsince \\(D\\), which Fido instantiates, is characterized by\n\\(B\\) (see Gorman 2014 for a critical discussion of this sort of\nview). \nMost philosophers, whether tacitly or overtly, appear to take\nexemplification as primitive and unanalyzable. However, on certain\nviews of particulars, it might seem that exemplification is reduced to\nsomething more fundamental. \nA well-known such approach is the bundle theory, which takes\nparticulars to be nothing more than “bundles” of\nuniversals connected by a special relation, commonly called\ncompresence, after Russell (1948: Pt. IV, ch.\n 8)[8].\n Despite well-known problems (Van Cleve 1985), this view, or\napproaches in its vicinity, keep having supporters (Casullo 1988;\nCurtis 2014; Dasgupta 2009; Paul 2002; Shiver 2014; J. Russell 2018;\nsee Sider 2020, ch. 3, for a recent critical analysis). From this\nperspective, that a particular exemplifies a property amounts to the\nproperty’s being compresent with the properties that constitute\nthe bundle with which the particular in question is identified. It\nthus looks as if exemplification is reduced to compresence.\nNevertheless, compresence itself is presumably jointly exemplified by\nthe properties that constitute a given bundle, and thus at most there\nis a reduction, to compresence, of exemplification by a\nparticular (understood as a bundle), and not an elimination of\nexemplification in general. \nAnother, more recent, approach is based on partial identity.\nBaxter (2001) and, inspired by him, Armstrong (2004), have proposed\nrelated assays of exemplification, which seem to analyze it in terms\nof such partial identity. These views have captured some interest and\ntriggered discussions (see, e.g., Mumford 2007; Baxter’s (2013)\nreply to critics and Baxter’s (2018) rejoinder to Brown\n2017). \nBaxter (2001) relies on the notion of aspect and on the\nrelativization of numerical identity to counts. In his view,\nboth particulars and properties have aspects, which can be\nsimilar to distinct aspects of other particulars or properties. The\nnumerical identity of aspects is relative to standards for counting,\ncounts, which group items in count collections: aspects of\nparticulars in the particular collection, and aspects of\nuniversals, in the universal collection. There can then be a\ncross-count identity, which holds between an aspect in the\nparticular collection, and an aspect in the universal collection,\ne.g., the aspects Hume as human and humanity as had by\nHume. In this case, the universal and the particular in question\n(humanity and Hume, in our example) are partially identical.\nInstantiation, e.g., that Hume instantiates humanity, then amounts to\nthis partial identity of a universal and a particular. One may have\nthe feeling, as Baxter himself worries (2001: 449), that in this\napproach instantiation has been traded for something definitely more\nobscure, such as aspects and an idiosyncratic view of identity. It can\nalso be suspected that particulars’ and properties’\nhaving aspects is presupposed in this analysis, where this\nhaving is a relation rather close to exemplification\nitself. \nArmstrong (2004) tries to do without aspects. At first glance it seems\nas if he analyzes exemplification, for he takes the exemplification of\na property (a universal) by a particular to be a partial identity of\nthe property and the particular; as he puts it (2004: 47), “[i]t\nis not a mere mereological overlap, as when two streets intersect, but\nit is a partial identity”. However, when we see more closely\nwhat this partial identity amounts to, the suspicion arises that it\npresupposes exemplification. For Armstrong appears to identify a\nparticular via the properties that it instantiates and\nsimilarly a property via the particulars that instantiate it.\nSo that we may identify a particular, \\(x\\), via a collection of\nproperties qua instantiated by \\(x\\), say \\(\\{F_x,\\) \\(G_x,\\)\n\\(H_x,\\) …, \\(P_x,\\) \\(Q_x,\\) \\(\\ldots\\};\\) and a property,\n\\(P\\), via a collection of particulars qua instantiating\n\\(P\\), say \\(\\{P_a, P_b , \\ldots ,P_x, P_y , \\ldots \\}\\). By putting\nthings in this way, we can then say that a particular is partially\nidentical to a property when the collection that identifies the\nparticular has an element in common with the collection that\nidentifies the property. To illustrate, the \\(x\\) and the \\(P\\) of our\nexample are partially identical because they have the element \\(P_x\\)\nin common. Now, the elements of these collections are neither\nproperties tout court nor particulars tout court,\nwhich led us to talk of properties qua instantiated and\nparticulars qua\n instantiating.[9]\n But this of course presupposes instantiation. Moreover, there is the\nunwelcome consequence that the world becomes dramatically less\ncontingent than we would have thought at first sight, for neither a\nconcrete particular nor a property can exist without it being the case\nthat the former has the properties it happens to have, and that the\nlatter is instantiated by the same particulars that actually\ninstantiate it; we get, as Mumford puts it (2007: 185), “a major\nnew kind of necessity in the world”. \nOne important motivation, possibly the main one, behind attempts at\nanalysis such as the ones we have just seen is the worry to avoid the\nso-called Bradley’s regress\nregarding\nexemplification (Baxter 2001: 449; Mumford 2007: 185), which goes as\nfollows. Suppose that the individual \\(a\\) has the property \\(F\\). For\n\\(a\\) to instantiate \\(F\\) it must be linked to \\(F\\) by a\n(dyadic) relation of instantiation, \\(I_1\\). But this requires a\nfurther (triadic) relation of instantiation, \\(I_2\\), that connects\n\\(I_1, F\\) and \\(a\\), and so on without end. At each stage a further\nconnecting relation is required, and thus it seems that nothing\never gets connected to anything else (it is not clear to what\nextent Bradley had this version in mind; for references to analogous\nregresses prior to Bradley’s, see Gaskin 2008: ch. 5,\n§70). \nThis regress has traditionally been regarded as vicious (see, e.g.,\nBergmann 1960), although philosophers such as Russell (1903: §55)\nand Armstrong (1997: 18–19) have argued that it is not. In doing\nso, however, they seem to take for granted the fact that \\(a\\) has the\nproperty \\(F\\) (pretty much as in the brute fact approach;\nsee below) and go on to see \\(a\\)’s and \\(F\\)’s\ninstantiating \\(I_1\\) as a further fact that is merely\nentailed by the former, which in turn entails \\(a\\)’s,\n\\(F\\)’s and \\(I_1\\)’s instantiating \\(I_2\\), and so on.\nThis way of looking at the matter tends to be regarded as a standard\nresponse to the regress. But those who see the regress as vicious\nassume that the various exemplification relations are introduced in an\neffort to explain the very existence of the fact that \\(a\\)\nhas the property \\(F\\). Hence, from their explanatory standpoint,\ntaking the fact in question as an unquestioned ground for a chain of\nentailments is beside the point (cf. Loux 1998: 31–36;\nVallicella 2002). \nIt should be noted, however, that this perspective suggests a\ndistinction between an “internalist” and an\n“externalist” version of the regress (in the terminology\nof Orilia 2006a). In the former, at each stage we postulate a new\nconstituent of the fact, or state of affairs, \\(s\\), that exists\ninsofar as \\(a\\) has the property \\(F\\), and there is viciousness\nbecause \\(s\\) can never be appropriately\n characterized.[10]\n In the latter, at each stage we postulate a new, distinct, state of\naffairs, whose existence is required by the existence of the state of\naffairs of the previous stage. This amounts to admitting infinite\nexplanatory and metaphysical dependence chains. However, according to\nOrilia (2006b: §7), since no decisive arguments against such\nchains exist, the externalist regress should not be viewed as vicious\n(for criticisms, see Maurin 2015 and Allen 2016: §2.4.1; for a\nsimilar view about predication, see Gaskin 2008). \nA typical line for those convinced that the regress is vicious has\nconsisted in proposing that instantiation is not a relation, or at\nleast not a normal one. Some philosophers hold that it is a sui\ngeneris linkage that hooks things up without intermediaries.\nPeter Strawson (1959) calls it a non-relational tie and\nBergmann (1960) calls it a nexus. Broad (1933: 85) likened\ninstantiation to glue, which just sticks two sheets of paper\ntogether, without needing anything additional; similarly,\ninstantiation just relates. An alternative line has been to\nreject instantiation altogether. According to Frege, it is not needed,\nbecause properties have “gaps” that can be filled, and\naccording to a reading of Wittgenstein’s Tractatus,\nbecause objects and properties can be connected like links in a chain.\nHowever, both strategies are problematic, as argued by Vallicella\n(2002). His basic point is that, if \\(a\\) has property \\(F\\), we need\nan ontological explanation of why \\(F\\) and \\(a\\) happen to be\nconnected in such a way that \\(a\\) has \\(F\\) as one of its properties\n(unless \\(F\\) is a property that \\(a\\) has necessarily). But none of\nthese strategies can provide this explanation. For example, the appeal\nto gaps is pointless: \\(F\\) has a gap whether or not it is filled by\n\\(a\\) (for example, it could be filled in by another object), and thus\nthe gap cannot explain the fact that \\(a\\) has \\(F\\) as one of its\nproperties. \nBefore turning to exemplification as partial identity, Armstrong\n(1997: 118) has claimed that Bradley’s regress can be avoided by\ntaking a state of affairs, say \\(x\\)’s being \\(P\\), as capable\nby itself of holding together its constituents, i.e., the object \\(x\\)\nand the property \\(P\\) (see also Perovic 2016). Thus, there is no need\nto invoke a relation of exemplification linking \\(x\\) and \\(P\\) in\norder to explain how \\(x\\) and \\(P\\) succeed in giving rise to a\nunitary item, namely the state of affairs in question. There seems to\nbe a circularity here for it appears that we want to explain how an\nobject and a property come to be united in a state of affairs by\nappealing to the result of this unification, namely the state of\naffairs itself. But perhaps this view can be interpreted as simply the\nidea that states of affairs should be taken for granted in a\nprimitivist fashion without seeking an explanation of their unity by\nappealing to exemplification or otherwise; this is the brute fact\napproach, as we may call it (for supporters, see Van Inwagen\n(1993: 37) and Oliver (1996: 33); for criticisms and a possible\ndefense, see Vallicella 2002, and Orilia 2016, respectively). \nLowe (2006) has tried to tackle Bradley’s regress within his\npluralist approach to exemplification. In his view, characterization,\ninstantiation and exemplification are “formal” and thus\nquite different from garden-variety relations such giving or\nloving. This guarantees that these three relations escape\nBradley’s regress (Lowe 2006: 30, 80,\n 90).[11]\n Let us illustrate how, by turning back to the Fido example of\n §2.1.\n What a mode instantiates and what it characterizes belong to its\nessence. In other words, a mode cannot exist without instantiating the\nattribute it instantiates and characterizing the object it\ncharacterizes. Hence, mode \\(b\\), by simply existing, instantiates\nattribute \\(B\\) and characterizes Fido. Moreover, since\nexemplification (the occurrent one, in this case) results from\n“composing” characterization and instantiation,\n\\(b\\)’s existence also guarantees that Fido exemplifies \\(B\\).\nAccording to Lowe, we thus have some truths, that \\(b\\) characterizes\nFido, that \\(b\\) instantiates \\(B\\), and that Fido exemplifies \\(B\\)\n(i.e., is barking), all of which are made true by \\(b\\). Hence, there\nis no need to postulate as truthmakers states of affairs with\nconstituents, Fido and \\(b\\), related by characterization, or \\(b\\)\nand \\(B\\), related by exemplification, or Fido and \\(B\\), related by\nexemplification. This, in Lowe’s opinion, eschews\nBradley’s regress, since this arises precisely because we appeal\nto states of affairs with constituents in need of a glue that\ncontingently keep them together. Nevertheless, there is no loss of\ncontingency in Lowe’s world picture, for an object need not be\ncharacterized by the modes that happen to characterize it. Thus, for\nexample, mode \\(b\\) might have failed to exist and there could have\nbeen a Fido silence mode in its stead, in which case the proposition\nthat Fido is barking would have been false and the proposition that\nFido is silent would have been true. One may wonder however what makes\nit the case that a certain mode is a mode of just a certain object and\nnot of another one, say another barking dog. Even granting that it is\nessential for \\(b\\) to be a mode of Fido, rather than of another dog,\nit remains true that it is of Fido, rather than of the other\ndog, and one may still think that this being of is also glue\nof some sort, perhaps with a contingency inherited from the\ncontingency of \\(b\\) (which might have failed to exist). The suspicion\nthen is that the problem of accounting for the relation between a mode\nand an object has replaced the Armstrongian one of what makes it the\ncase that a universal \\(P\\) and an object \\(x\\) make up the state of\naffairs \\(x\\)’s being \\(P\\). But the former problem,\none may urge, is no less thorny than the latter, and some\nuniversalists like Armstrong may consider uneconomical Lowe’s\nacceptance of tropes in addition to universals (for accounts of\nBradley’s regress analogous to Lowe’s, but within a\nthoroughly tropist ontology, see Section 3.2 of the entry on\n tropes.) \nAs it should be clear from this far from exhaustive survey,\nBradley’s regress deeply worries ontologists and the attempts to\ntame it keep\n flowing.[12] \nPresumably, properties exemplify properties. For example, if\nproperties are abstract objects, as is usually thought, then seemingly\nevery property exemplifies abstractness. But then we should also grant\nthat there is self-exemplification, i.e., a property exemplifying\nitself. For example, abstractness is itself abstract and thus\nexemplifies itself. Self-exemplification however has raised severe\nperplexities at least since Plato. \nPlato appears to hold that all properties exemplify\nthemselves, when he claims that forms participate in themselves. This\nclaim is crucially involved in his so-called third man\nargument, which led him to worry that his theory of forms is\nincoherent (Parmenides, 132 ff.). As we see matters now, it\nis not clear why we should hold that all properties exemplify\nthemselves (Armstrong 1978a: 71); for instance, people are honest, but\nhonesty itself is not honest (see, however, the entry on\n Plato’s Parmenides,\n and Marmodoro forthcoming). \nNowadays, a more serious worry related to self-exemplification is\nRussell’s famous paradox, constructed as regarding the property\nof non-self-exemplification, which appears to exemplify itself iff it\ndoes not, thus defying the laws of logic, at least classical logic.\nThe discovery of his paradox (and then the awareness of related\npuzzles) led Russell to introduce a theory of types, which institutes\na total ban on self-predication by a rigid segregation of properties\ninto a hierarchy of types (more on this in\n §6.1).\n The account became more complex and rigid, as Russell moved from\nsimple to ramified type theory, which involves a\ndistinction of orders within types (see entries on\n type theory\n and\n Russell’s paradox,\n and, for a detailed reconstruction of how Russell reacted to the\nparadox, Landini 1998). \nIn type theory all properties are, we may say, typed. This\napproach has never gained unanimous consensus and its many problematic\naspects are well-known (see, e.g., Fitch 1952: Appendix C; Bealer\n1989). Just to mention a few, the type-theoretical hierarchy imposed\non properties appears to be highly artificial and multiplies\nproperties ad infinitum (e.g., since presumably properties\nare abstract, for any property \\(P\\) of type \\(n\\), there is an\nabstractness of type \\(n+1\\) that \\(P\\) exemplifies). Moreover, many\ncases of self-exemplification are innocuous and common. For example,\nthe property of being a property is itself a property, so it\nexemplifies itself. Accordingly, many recent proposals are type-free\n(see\n §6.1)\n and thus view properties as untyped, capable of being\nself-predicated, sometimes veridically. An additional motivation to\nmove in this direction is a new paradox proposed by Orilia and Landini\n(2019), which affects simple type theory. It is\n“contingent” in that it is derived from a contingent\nassumption, namely that someone, say John, is thinking just about the\nproperty of being a property \\(P\\) such that John is thinking of\nsomething that is not exemplified by \\(P\\). \nQuine (1957 [1969: 23]) famously claimed that there should be no\nentity without identity. His paradigmatic case concerns sets: two of\nthem are identical iff they have exactly the same members. Since then\nit has been customary in ontology to search for identity conditions\nfor given categories of entities and to rule out categories for want\nof identity conditions (against this, see Lowe 1989). Quine started\nthis trend precisely by arguing against properties and this has\nstrictly intertwined the issues of which properties there are and of\ntheir identity\n conditions.[13] \nIn an effort to provide identity conditions for properties, one could\nmimic those for sets, or equate the former with the latter (as in\nclass nominalism; see note 3), and provide the following\nextensionalist identity conditions: two properties are\nidentical iff they are co-extensional. This criterion can hardly work,\nhowever, since there are seemingly distinct properties with the same\nextension, such as having a heart and having\nkidneys, and even wildly different properties such as\nspherical and weighing 2 kilos could by accident be\nco-extensive. \nOne could then try the following intensional identity\nconditions: two properties are identical iff they are\nco-intensional, i.e., necessarily co-extensional, where the\nnecessity in question is logical necessity. This guarantees that\nspherical and weighing 2 kilos are different even if\nthey happen to be co-extensional. Following this line, one may take\nproperties to be intensions, understood as, roughly,\nfunctions that assign extensions (sets of objects) to predicates at\nlogically possible worlds. Thus, for instance, the predicates\n“has a heart” and “has kidneys” stand for\ndifferent intensions, for even if they have the same extension in the\nactual world they have different extensions at worlds where there are\ncreatures with heart and no kidneys or vice versa. This approach is\nfollowed by Montague (1974) in his pioneering work in natural language\nsemantics, and in a similar way by Lewis (1986b), who reduces\nproperties to sets of possible objects in his modal realism,\nexplicitly committed to possible worlds and mere possibilia\ninhabiting them. Most philosophers find this commitment unappealing.\nMoreover, one may wonder how properties can do their causal work if\nthey are conceived of in this way (for further criticisms see Bealer\n1982: 13–19, and 1998: §4; Egan 2004). However, the\ncriterion of co-intensionality may be accepted without also buying the\nreduction of properties to sets of possibilia (Bealer views\nthis as the identity condition for his conception 1 properties; see\nbelow). Still, co-intensionality must face two challenges coming from\nopposite fronts. \nOn the one hand, from the perspective of empirical science,\nco-intensionality may appear too strong as a criterion of identity.\nFor the identity statements of scientific reductions, such as that of\ntemperature to mean kinetic energy, could suggest that some properties\nare identical even if not co-intensional. For example, one may accept\nthat having absolute temperature of 300K is having mean\nmolecular kinetic energy of \\(6.21 \\times 10^{-21}\\) (Achinstein\n1974: 259; Putnam (1970: §1) and Causey (1972) speak of\n“synthetic identity” and “contingent\nidentity”, respectively). Rather than logical necessity, it is\nnomological necessity, necessity on the basis of the causal\nlaws of nature, that becomes central in this line of thought.\nFollowing it, some have focused on the causal and\nnomological roles of properties, i.e., roughly, the causes\nand effects of their being instantiated, and their involvement in laws\nof nature, respectively. They have thus advanced causal or\nnomic criteria. According to them, two properties are identical\niff they have the same causal (Achinstein 1974: §XI; Shoemaker\n1980) or nomological role (Swoyer 1982; Kistler 2002). This line has\nbeen influential, as it connects to the “pure\ndispositionalism” discussed in\n §5.2.\n There is however a suspicion of circularity here, since causal and\nnomological roles may be viewed as higher-order properties (see entry\non\n dispositions, §3). \nOn the other hand, once matters of meaning and mental content are\ntaken into account, co-intensionality might seem too weak, for it\nmakes a property \\(P\\) identical to any logically equivalent property,\ne.g., assuming classical logic, \\(P\\) and (\\(Q\\) or not\n\\(Q\\)). And with a sufficiently broad notion of logical\nnecessity, even, for example, being triangular and being\ntrilateral are identical. However, one could insist that\n“trilateral” and “triangular” appear to have\ndifferent meanings, which somehow involve the different geometrical\nproperties having a side, and having an angle,\nrespectively. And if being triangular were really identical\nto being trilateral, from the fact that John believes that a\ncertain object has the former property, one should be able to infer\nthat John also believes that such an object has the latter property.\nYet, John’s ignorance may make this conclusion unwarranted. In\nthe light of this, borrowing a term from Cresswell (1975), one may\nmove from intensional to hyperintensional identity\nconditions, according to which two properties, such as trilaterality\nand triangularity, may be different even if they are co-intensional.\nIn order to implement this idea, Bealer (1982) take two properties to\nbe identical iff they have the same analysis, i.e., roughly, they\nresult from the same ultimate primitive properties and the same\nlogical operations applied to them (see also Menzel 1986; 1993). Zalta\n(1983; 1988) has developed an alternative available to those who admit\ntwo modes of predication (see\n §1.4):\n two properties are identical iff they are (necessarily) encoded by\nthe same objects. \nHyperintensional conditions make of course for finer distinctions\namong entities than the other criteria we considered. Accordingly, the\nformer are often called “fine-grained” and the latter\n“coarse-grained”, and the same denominations are\ncorrespondingly reserved for the entities that obey the conditions in\nquestion. Coarse- or fine-grainedness is a relative matter. The\nextensional criterion is more coarse-grained than the intensional or\ncausal/nomological ones. And hyperintensional conditions themselves\nmay be more or less fine-grained: properties could be individuated\nalmost as finely as the predicates expressing them, to the point that,\ne.g., even being \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) and being \\(Q\\) and\n\\(P\\) are kept distinct, but one may also envisage less stringent\nconditions that make for the identification of properties of that sort\n(Bealer 1982: 54). It is conceivable, however, that one could be\nlogically obtuse to the point of believing that something has a\ncertain property without believing that it has a trivially equivalent\nproperty. Thus, to properly account for mental content,\nmaximal hyperintensionality appears to be required, and it is\nin fact preferred by Bealer. Even so, the paradox of analysis\nraises a serious issue.\nOne could say, for example, that being a circle is being\na locus of points equidistant from a point, since the latter\nprovides the analysis of the former. In reply, Bealer distinguishes\nbetween “being a circle” as designating a simple\n“undefined” property, which is an analysandum\ndistinct from the analysans, being a locus of points\nequidistant from a point, and “being a circle” as\ndesignating a complex “defined” property, which is indeed\nidentical to that analysans. Orilia (1999: §5.5)\nsimilarly distinguishes between the simple analysans and the\ncomplex analysandum, without admitting that expressions for\nproperties such as “being a circle” could be ambiguous in\nthe way Bealer suggests. Orilia rather argues that the\n“is” of analysis does not express identity but a weaker\nrelation, which is asymmetrical in that analysans and\nanalysandum play different roles in it. The matter keeps\nbeing discussed. Rosen (2015) appeals to grounding to characterize the\ndifferent role played by the analysans. Dorr (2016) provides\na formal account of the “is” used in identity statements\ninvolving properties, according to which it stands for a symmetric\n“identification” relation. \nBealer (1982) distinguishes between conception 1 properties,\nor qualities, and conception 2 properties, or\nconcepts (understood as mind-independent). With a different\nand now widespread terminology, Lewis (1983, 1986b) followed suit,\nspeaking of a sparse and an abundant conception of\nproperties. According to the former, there are relatively few\nproperties, namely just those responsible for the objective\nresemblances and causal powers of things; they cut nature at its\njoints, and science is supposed to individuate them a\nposteriori. According to the latter, there are immensely many\nproperties, corresponding to all meaningful predicates we could\npossibly imagine and to all sets of objects, and they can be assumed\na priori. (It should be clear that “few” and\n“many” are used in a comparative sense, for the number of\nsparse properties may be very high, possibly infinite). To illustrate,\nthe sparse conception admits properties currently accepted by\nempirical science such as having negative charge or\nhaving spin up and rejects those that are no longer supported\nsuch as having a certain amount of caloric, which featured in\neighteenth century chemistry; in contrast, the abundant conception may\nacknowledge the latter property and all sorts of other properties,\nstrange as they may be, e.g., negatively charged or disliked by\nSocrates, round and square or Goodman’s (1983)\nnotorious grue and bleen. Lewis (1986b: 60) tries to\nfurther characterize the distinction by taking the sparse properties\nto be intrinsic, rather than extrinsic (e.g.,\nbeing 6 feet tall, rather than being taller than\nTom), and natural, where naturalness is something that\nadmits of degrees (for example, he says, masses and charges are\nperfectly natural, colors are less natural and grue and\nbleen are paradigms of unnaturalness). Much work on such\nissues has been done since then (see entries on\n intrinsic vs. extrinsic properties\n and\n natural properties). \nDepending on how sparse or abundant properties are, we can have two\nextreme positions and other more moderate views in between. \nAt one end of the spectrum, there is the most extreme version of the\nsparse conception, minimalism, which accepts all of these\nprinciples: \nThis approach is typically motivated by physicalism and\nepistemological qualms regarding transcendent universals. The\nbest-known contemporary supporter of minimalism is Armstrong (1978a,b,\n1984). Another minimalist is Swoyer (1996). \nBy dropping or mitigating some of the above principles, we get less\nminimalist versions of the sparse conception. For example, some have\nurged uninstantiated properties to account for features of measurement\n(Mundy 1987), vectors (Bigelow & Pargetter 1991: 77), or natural\nlaws (Tooley 1987), and some even that there are all the properties\nthat can be possibly exemplified, where the possibility in question is\ncausal or nomic (Cocchiarella 2007: ch. 12). In line with\npositions traditionally found in emergentism (see\n §5.1),\n Schaffer (2004) proposes that there are sparse properties as\nfundamental, and in addition, as grounded on them, the properties that\nneed be postulated at all levels of scientific explanations, e.g.,\nchemical, biological and psychological ones. Even Armstrong goes\nbeyond minimalist strictures, when in his later work (1997)\ndistinguishes between “first-class properties”\n(universals), identified from a minimalist perspective, and\n“second-class properties” (supervening on universals). All\nthese positions appear to be primarily concerned with issues in the\nmetaphysics of science (see\n §5)\n and typically display too short a supply of properties to deal with\nmeaning and mental content, and thus with natural language semantics\nand the foundations of mathematics (see\n §6).\n However, minimalists might want to resort to concepts, understood as\nmind-dependent entities, in dealing with such issues (e.g., along the\nlines proposed in Cocchiarella 2007). \nMatters of meaning and mental content are instead what typically\nmotivate the views at the opposite end of the spectrum. To begin with,\nmaximalism, i.e., the abundant conception in all its glory\n(Bealer 1982; 1993; Carmichael 2010; Castañeda 1976; Jubien\n1989; Lewis 1986b; Orilia 1999; Zalta 1988; Van Inwagen 2004):\nproperties are fine-grained necessary entities that exist even if\nuninstantiated, or even impossible to be instantiated. In its most\nextreme version, maximalism adopts identity conditions that\ndifferentiate properties as much as possible, but more moderate\nversions can be obtained by slightly relaxing such conditions. Views\nof this sort are hardly concerned with physicalist constraints or the\nlike and rather focus on the explanatory advantages of\nhyperintensionality. These may well go beyond the typical motivations\nconsidered above: Nolan (2014) argues that hyperintensionality is\nincreasingly important in metaphysics in dealing with issues such as\ncounter-possible conditionals, explanation, essences, grounding,\ncausation, confirmation and chance. \nRather than choosing between the sparse and abundant conceptions, the\nvery promoters of this distinction have opted in different ways for a\ndualism of properties, according to which there are\nproperties of both kinds. Lewis endorses abundant properties as\nreduced to sets of possibilia, and sparse properties either\nviewed as universals, and corresponding to some of the abundant\nproperties (1983), or as themselves sets of possibilia (1986b: 60).\nBealer (1982) proposes a systematic account wherein qualities are the\ncoarse-grained properties that “provide the world with its\ncausal and phenomenal order” (1982: 183) and concepts are the\nfine-grained properties that can function as meanings and as\nconstituents of mental contents. He admits a stock of simple\nproperties, which are both qualities and concepts (1982: 186),\nwherefrom complex qualities and complex concepts are differently\nconstructed: on the one hand, by thought-building operations,\nwhich give rise to fine-grained qualities; on the other hand, by\ncondition-building operations, which give rise to\ncoarse-grained qualities. Orilia (1999) has followed Bealer’s\nlead in also endorsing both coarse-grained qualities and fine-grained\nconcepts, without however identifying simple concepts and simple\nqualities. In Orilia’s account concepts are never identical to\nqualities, but may correspond to them; in particular, the identity\nstatements of intertheoretic reductions should be taken to express the\nfact that two different concepts correspond to the same quality.\nDespite its advantages in dealing with a disparate range of phenomena,\ndualism has not gained any explicit consensus. Its implicit presence\nmay however be widespread. For example, Putnam’s (1970: §1)\ndistinction between predicates and physical\nproperties, and Armstrong’s above-mentioned recognition of\nsecond-class properties may be seen as forms of dualism. \nIt is customary to distinguish between simple and\ncomplex properties, even though some philosophers take all\nproperties to be simple (Grossmann 1983: §§58–61). The\nformer are not characterizable in terms of other properties, are\nprimitive and unanalyzable and thus have no internal structure,\nwhereas the latter somehow have a structure, wherein other properties,\nor more generally entities, are parts or constituents. It is not\nobvious that there are simple properties, since one may imagine that\nall properties are analyzable into constituents ad infinitum\n(Armstrong 1978b: 67). Even setting this aside, to provide examples is\nnot easy. Traditionally, determinate colors are cited, but nowadays\nmany would rather appeal to fundamental physical properties such as\nhaving a certain electric charge. It is easier to provide\nputative examples of complex properties, once some other properties\nare taken for granted, e.g., blue and spherical or blue\nor non-spherical. These logically compound properties,\nwhich involve logical operations, will be considered in\n §4.1.\n Next, in\n §4.2\n we shall discuss other kinds of complex properties, called\nstructural (after Armstrong 1978b), which are eliciting a\ngrowing interest, as a recent survey testifies (Fisher 2018). Their\ncomplexity has to do with the subdivisions of their instances into\nsubcomponents. Typical examples come from chemistry, e.g.,\nH2O and methane understood as properties\nof molecules. \nIt should be noted that it is not generally taken for granted that\ncomplex properties literally have parts or constituents. Some\nphilosophers take this line (Armstrong 1978a: 36–39, 67ff.;\nBigelow & Pargetter 1989; Orilia 1999), whereas others demur, and\nrather think that talk in terms of structures with constituents is\nmetaphorical and dependent on our reliance on structured terms such as\n“blue and spherical” (Bealer 1982; Cocchiarella 1986a;\nSwoyer 1998: §1.2). \nAt least prima facie, our use of complex predicates suggests\nthat there are corresponding complex properties involving all sorts of\nlogical operations. Thus, one can envisage conjunctive\nproperties such as blue and spherical, negative properties\nsuch as non-spherical, disjunctive properties such\nas blue or non-spherical, existentially or\nuniversally quantified properties such as loving\nsomeone or loved by everyone, reflexive\nproperties such as loving oneself, etc. Moreover, one could\nadd to the list properties with individuals as constituents, which are\nthen denied the status of a purely qualitative property,\ne.g., taller than Obama. \nIt is easy to construct complex predicates. But whether there really\nare corresponding properties of this kind is a much more difficult and\ncontroversial issue, tightly bound to the sparse/abundant distinction.\nIn the sparse conception the tendency is to dispense with them. This\nis understandable since in this camp one typically postulates\nproperties in rebus for empirical explanatory reasons. But\nthen, if we explain some phenomena by attributing properties \\(F\\) and\n\\(G\\) to an object, while denying that it does not exemplify \\(H\\), it\nseems of no value to add that it also has, say, F and G,\nF or H, and non-H. Nevertheless, Armstrong, the\nleading supporter of sparseness, has defended over the years a mixed\nstance without disjunctive and negative properties, but with\nconjunctive ones. Armstrong’s line has of course its opponents\n(see, e.g., Paolini Paoletti 2014; 2017a; 2020a; Zangwill 2011 argues\nthat there are negative properties, but they are less real than\npositive ones). On the other hand, in the abundant conception, all\nsorts of logically compound properties are acknowledged. Since the\nfocus now is on meaning and mental content, it appears natural to\npostulate such properties to account for our understanding of complex\npredicates and of how they differ from simple ones. Even here,\nhowever, there are disagreements, when it comes to problematic\npredicates such the “does not exemplify itself” of\nRussell’s paradox. Some suggest that in this case one should\ndeny there is a corresponding property, in order to avoid the paradox\n(Van Inwagen 2006). However, we understand this predicate and thus it\nseems ad hoc that the general strategy of postulating a\nproperty fails. It seems better to confront the paradox with other\nmeans (see\n §6). \nFollowing Armstrong (1978b: 68–71; see also Fisher 2018:\n§2), a structural property \\(F\\) is typically viewed as a\nuniversal, and can be characterized thus: \nFor instance, a molecule \\(w\\) exemplifying H2O\nhas as parts two atoms \\(h_1\\) and \\(h_2\\) and an atom \\(o\\) that do\nnot exemplify H2O; this property involves\nhydrogen and oxygen, which are not exemplified by\n\\(w\\); \\(h_1\\) and \\(h_2\\) exemplify hydrogen, and \\(o\\)\nexemplifies oxygen. For relational structural\nproperties, there is the further condition that \nH2O is a case in point: the relevant (chemical)\nrelation is bonding, which links the three atoms in question.\nAnother, often considered, example is methane as a structural\nproperty of methane-molecules (CH4), which\ninvolves a bonding relation between atoms and the joint\ninstantiation of hydrogen (by four atoms) and carbon\n(by one atom). Non-relational structural properties do not\nrequire condition (iv). For instance, mass 1 kg involves many\nrelevant properties of the kind mass n kg, for \\(n \\lt 1\\),\nwhich are instantiated by relevant proper parts of any object that is\n1 kg in mass, and these proper parts are not linked by any relevant\nrelation (Armstrong 1978b: 70). \nIn most approaches, including Armstrong’s, the relevant\nproperties and the relevant relation, if any, are conceived of as\nparts, or constituents, of the structural property in question, and\nthus their being involved in the latter is a parthood relation. For\ninstance, hydrogen, oxygen and bonding are\nconstituents of H2O. Moreover, the composition of\nstructural properties is isomorphic to that of the complexes\nexemplifying them. These two theses characterize what Lewis (1986a)\ncalls the “pictorial conception”. It is worth noting that\nstructural properties differ from conjunctive properties such as\nhuman and musician, in that the constituents of the latter\n(i.e., human and musician) are instantiated by\nwhatever entity exemplifies the conjunctive property (i.e., a human\nbeing who is also a musician), whereas the constituents of a\nstructural property (e.g., hydrogen, oxygen and\nbonding) are not instantiated by the entities that\ninstantiate it (e.g., H2O molecules). \nStructural properties have been invoked for many reasons. Armstrong\n(1978b: ch. 22) appeals to them to explain the resemblance of\nuniversals belonging to a common class, e.g., lengths and colors.\nArmstrong (1988; 1989) also treats physical quantities and numbers\nthrough structural properties. The former involve, as in the above\nmass 1 kg example, smaller quantities such as mass 0.1\nkg and mass 0.2 kg (this view is criticized by Eddon\n2007). The latter are internal proportion relations between structural\nproperties (e.g., being a nineteen-electrons aggregate) and\nunit-properties (e.g., being an electron). Moreover,\nstructural properties have been appealed to in treatments of laws of\nnature (Armstrong 1989; Lewis 1986a), some natural kinds (Armstrong\n1978b, 1997; Hawley & Bird 2011), possible worlds (Forrest 1986),\nersatz times (Parsons 2005), emergent properties\n(O’Connor & Wong 2005), linguistic types (Davis 2014), ontic\nstructural realism (Psillos 2012). However, structural universals have\nalso been questioned on various grounds, as we shall now see. \nLewis (1986a) raises two problems for the pictorial conception. First,\nit is not clear how one and the same universal (e.g.,\nhydrogen) can recur more than once in a structural universal.\nLet us dub this “multiple recurrence problem”. Secondly,\nstructural universals violate the Principle of Uniqueness of\nComposition of classical\n mereology.\n According to this principle, given a certain collection of parts,\nthere is only one whole that they compose. Consider isomers, namely,\nmolecules that have the same number and types of atoms but different\nstructures, e.g., butane and isobutane\n(C4H10). Here, butane and\nisobutane are different structural universals. Yet, they\narise from the same universals recurring the same number of times. Let\nus dub this “isomer problem.” \nTwo further problems may be pointed out. First, even molecules with\nthe same number and types of atoms and the same structures may vary in\nvirtue of their spatial orientation (Kalhat 2008). This phenomenon is\nknown as chirality. How can structural properties account for\nit? Secondly, the composition of structural properties is restricted:\nnot every collection of properties gives rise to a structural\nproperty. This violates another principle of classical mereology: the\nPrinciple of Unrestricted Composition. \nLewis dismisses alternatives to the pictorial conception, such as the\n“linguistic conception” (in which structural universals\nare set-theoretic constructions out of simple universals) and the\n“magic conception” (in which structural universals\nare not complex and are primitively connected to the relevant\nproperties). Moreover, he also rejects the possibility of there being\namphibians, i.e., particularized universals lying between\nparticulars and full-fledged universals. Amphibians would solve the\nmultiple recurrence problem, as they would be identical with multiple\nrecurrences of single universals. For example, in methane,\nthere would be four amphibians of hydrogen. \nTo reply to Lewis’ challenges, two main strategies have been\nadopted on behalf of the pictorial conception: a non-mereological\ncomposition strategy, according to which structural properties do not\nobey the principles of classical mereology, and a mereology-friendly\nstrategy. Let us start with the former. \nArmstrong (1986) admits that the composition of structural universals\nis non-mereological. In his 1997, he emphasizes that states of affairs\ndo not have a mereological kind of composition, and views universals,\nincluding structural ones, as states of affairs-types which,\nas such, are not mereological in their composition. Structural\nuniversals themselves turn out to be state of affairs-types of a\nconjunctive sort (1997: 34 ff.). To illustrate, let us go back to the\nabove example with H2O exemplified by the water\nmolecule \\(w\\). It involves the conjunction of these states of\naffairs: \nThis conjunction of states of affairs provides an example of a\nstate of affairs-type identifiable with the structural universal\nH2O. \nIn pursuit of the non-mereological composition strategy, Forrest\n(1986; 2006; 2016) relies on logically compound properties, in\nparticular (in his 2016) conjunctive, existentially quantified and\nreflexive ones. Bennett (2013) argues that entities are part of\nfurther entities by occupying specific slots within the latter.\nParthood slots are distinct from each other. Therefore, which entity\noccupies which slot matters to the composition of the resultant\ncomplex entity. Hawley (2010) defends the possibility of there being\nmultiple composition relations. In a more general way, McDaniel (2009)\npoints out that the relation of structure-making does not obey some of\nthe principles of classical mereology. Mormann (2010) argues that\ndistinct categories (to be understood as in\n category theory)\n come together with distinct parthood and composition relations. \nAs regards the mereology-friendly strategy, it has been suggested that\nstructural properties actually include extra components accounting for\nstructures, so that the Principle of Uniqueness of Composition is\nsafe. Considering methane, Pagès (2002) claims that\nsuch a structural property is composed of the properties\ncarbon and hydrogen, a bonding relation and\na peculiar first-order, formal relation between the atoms. According\nto Kalhat (2008), the extra component is a second-order arrangement\nrelation between the first-order properties. Ordering formal\nrelations—together with causally individuated\nproperties—are also invoked by McFarland (2018). \nAt the intersection of these strategies, Bigelow and Pargetter (1989,\n1991) claim that structural universals are internally relational\nproperties that supervene on first-order properties and relations and\non second-order proportion relations. Second-order proportion\nrelations are relations such as having four times as. They\nrelate first-order properties and relations. For example, in\nmethane, the relation having four times as relates\ntwo conjunctive properties: (i) hydrogen and being part of this\nmolecule; (ii) carbon and being part of this\nmolecule. \nCampbell (1990) solves the multiple recurrence problem and the isomer\nproblem by appealing to tropes. In methane, there are\nmultiple hydrogen tropes. In butane and isobutane,\ndistinct tropes entertain distinct structural relations. \nDespite Lewis’ dismissal, a number of theories appeal to\namphibians (i.e., particularized universals lying between particulars\nand full-fledged universals) or, more precisely, to entities similar\nto amphibians. Fine (2017) suggests that structural properties should\nbe treated by invoking arbitrary objects (Fine 1985). Davis’\n(2014) account of linguistic types as structural properties confronts\nthe problem of the multiple occurrence of one type, e.g.,\n“dog”, in another (e.g., “every dog likes another\ndog”) (Wetzel 2009). In general, the idea that types are\nproperties of tokens is a natural one, although there are also\nalternative views on the matter (see entry on\n types and tokens).\n Be this as it may, Davis proposes that types cannot occur within\nfurther types as tokens: they can only occur as subtypes.\nTherefore, subtypes lie, like amphibians, between types and tokens.\nSubtypes are individuated by their positions in asymmetric wholes,\nwhereas they are primitively and non-qualitatively distinct in\nsymmetric ones. The approach could be extended to properties such as\nmethane, which would be taken to have four distinct\nhydrogen subtypes. \nWhen it comes to the metaphysical underpinnings of scientific\ntheories, properties play a prominent role: it appears that science\ncan hardly be done without appealing to them. This adds up to the case\nfor realism about properties and to our understanding of them. We\nshall illustrate this here first by dwelling on some miscellaneous\ntopics and then by focusing on a debate regarding the very nature of\nthe properties invoked in science, namely whether or not they are\nessentially dispositional. Roughly, an object exemplifies a\ndispositional property, such as soluble or\nfragile, by having a power or disposition to act or being\nacted upon in a certain way in certain conditions. For example, a\nglass’ disposition of being fragile consists in its\npossibly shattering in certain conditions (e.g., if struck with a\ncertain force). In contrast, something exemplifies a\ncategorical property, e.g., made of salt or\nspherical, by merely being in a certain way (see entry on\n dispositions). \nMany predicates in scientific theories (e.g., “being a\ngene” and “being a belief”) are functionally\ndefined. Namely, their meaning is fixed by appealing to some function\nor set of functions (e.g., encoding and transmitting genetic\ninformation). To make sense of functions, properties are needed.\nFirst, functions can be thought of as webs of causal relationships\nbetween properties or property-instances. Secondly, predicates such as\n“being a gene” may be taken to refer to\nhigher-level properties, or at least to something that has\nsuch properties. In this case, the property of being a gene\nwould be the higher-level property of possessing some further\nproperties (e.g., biochemical ones) that play the relevant\nfunctions (i.e., encoding and transmitting genetic information).\nAlternatively, being a gene would be a property that\nsatisfies the former higher-level property. Thirdly, the ensuing\nrealization relationships between higher-level and function-playing\nproperties can only be defined by appealing to properties (see entry\non\n functionalism). \nMore generally, many ontological\ndependence  and reduction\nrelationships primarily concern properties: type-identity (Place 1956;\nSmart 1959; Lewis 1966) and token-identity (Davidson 1980) (see entry\non\n the mind/brain identity theory),\n supervenience (Horgan 1982; Kim 1993; entry on\n supervenience);\n realization (Putnam 1975; Wilson 1999; Shoemaker 2007), \nscientific reduction\n(Nagel 1961). Moreover,\na non-reductive relation such as ontological emergence (Bedau 1997;\nPaolini Paoletti 2017b) is typically characterized as a relation\nbetween emergent properties\nand more fundamental\nproperties. Even mechanistic explanations often appeal to properties\nand relations in characterizing the organization, the components, the\npowers and the phenomena displayed by mechanisms (Glennan & Illari\n2018; entry on\n mechanisms in science). \nEntities in nature are typified by\n natural kinds.\n These are mostly thought of as properties or property-like entities\nthat carve nature at its joints (Campbell, O'Rourke, & Slater\n2011) at distinct layers of the universe: microphysical (e.g.,\nbeing a neutron), chemical (e.g., being gold),\nbiological (e.g., being a horse). \nPhysical quantities such as mass or length are typically treated as\nproperties, specifiable in terms of a magnitude, a certain number, and\na unit measure, e.g., kg or meter, which can itself be specified in\nterms of properties (Mundy 1987; Swoyer 1987). Following Eddon’s\n(2013) overview, it is possible to distinguish two main strands here:\nrelational and monadic properties theories (see also\nDasgupta 2013). In relational theories (Bigelow & Pargetter 1988;\n1991), quantities arise from proportion relations, which may in turn\nbe related by higher-order proportion relations. Consider a certain\nquantity, e.g., mass 3 kg. Here the thrice as massive\nas proportion relation is relevant, which holds of certain pairs\nof objects \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(a\\) is thrice as massive as\n\\(b\\). By virtue of such relational facts, the first members of such\npairs have a mass of 3 kg. Another relational approach is by Mundy\n(1988), who claims that mass 3 kg is a relation between\n(ordered pairs of) objects and numbers. For example, mass 3\nkg is a relation holding between the ordered pair \\(\\langle a,\nb\\rangle\\) (assuming that \\(a\\) is thrice as massive as \\(b\\), and not\nthe other way round) and the number 3; or—if relations have\nbuilt-in relational order—between \\(a, b\\) and 3. Knowles (2015)\nholds a similar view, wherein physical quantities are relations that\nobjects bear to numbers. According to the monadic properties approach,\nquantities are intrinsic properties of objects (Swoyer 1987; Armstrong\n1988; 1989). As we saw, Armstrong develops such a view by taking\nquantities to be structural properties. Related metaphysical inquiries\nconcern the dimensions of quantities (Skow 2017) and the status of\nforces (Massin 2009). \nLastly, properties play a prominent role in two well-known accounts of\nthe\n laws of nature:\n the nomological necessitation account and law\ndispositionalism. The former has been expounded by Tooley (1977;\n1987), Dretske (1977) and Armstrong (1983). Roughly, following\nArmstrong, a law of nature consists in a second-order and external\nnomological necessitation relation \\(\\rN\\), contingently holding\nbetween first-order universals \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\): \\(\\rN(P, Q)\\). Such a\nhigher-order fact necessitates certain lower-order regularities, i.e.,\nall the objects that have \\(P\\) also have \\(Q\\) (by nomological\nnecessity, in virtue of \\(\\rN(P, Q))\\). Law dispositionalism\ninterprets laws of nature by appealing to dispositional properties.\nAccording to it, laws of nature “flow” from the essence of\nsuch properties. This implies that laws of nature hold with\nmetaphysical necessity: whenever the dispositions are in place, the\nrelevant laws must be in place too (Cartwright 1983; Ellis 2001; Bird\n2007; Chakravartty 2007; Fischer 2018; see also Schrenk 2017 and\nDumsday 2019). (For criticisms, see, e.g., van Fraassen 1989 as\nregards the former approach, and McKitrick 2018 and Paolini Paoletti\n2020b, as regards the latter). \nThere is a domestic dispute among supporters of properties in the\nmetaphysics of science, regarding the very nature of such properties\n(or at least the fundamental ones). We may distinguish two extreme\nviews, pure dispositionalism and pure\ncategoricalism. According to the former, all properties are\nessentially dispositional (“dispositional”, for\nbrevity’s sake, from now on), since they are nothing more than\ncausal powers; their causative roles, i.e., which effects\ntheir instantiations can cause, exhaust their essences. According to\npure categoricalism, all properties are essentially categorical (in\nbrief, “categorical”, in the following), because their\ncausative roles are not essential to them. If anything is essential to\na property, it is rather a non-dispositional and intrinsic aspect\ncalled “quiddity” (after Armstrong 1989), which need not\nbe seen as an additional entity over and above the property itself\n(Locke 2012, in response to Hawthorne 2001). Between such views there\nlie a number of intermediate positions. \nPure dispositionalism has been widely supported in the last few\ndecades (Mellor 1974; 2000; Shoemaker 1984: ch. 10 and 11 [in terms of\ncausal roles]; Mumford 1998; 2004; Bird 2005; 2007; Chakravartty 2007;\nWhittle 2008; see Tugby 2013 for an attempt to argue from this sort of\nview to a Platonist conception of properties). There are three main\narguments in favor of it. First, pure dispositionalism easily accounts\nfor the natural necessity of the laws of nature, insofar as such a\nnecessity just “flows” from the essence of the\ndispositional properties involved. Secondly, dispositional properties\ncan be easily known as they really are, because it is part of their\nessence that they affect us in certain ways. Thirdly, at the\n(presumably fundamental) micro-physical level, properties are only\ndescribed dispositionally, which is best explained by their being\ndispositional (Ellis & Lierse 1994; N. Williams 2011). \nNevertheless, pure dispositionalism is affected by several problems.\nFirst, some authors believe that it is not easy to provide a clear-cut\ndistinction between dispositional and would-be non-dispositional\nproperties (Cross 2005). Secondly, it seems that the essence of\ncertain properties does not include, or is not exhausted by, their\ncausative roles: qualia, inert and epiphenomenal\n properties,[14]\n structural and geometrical properties, spatio-temporal properties\n(Prior 1982; Armstrong 1999; for some responses, see Mellor 1974 and\nBird 2007; 2009). Thirdly, there can be symmetrical causative\nroles. Consider three distinct properties \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) such\nthat \\(A\\) can cause \\(B\\), \\(B\\) can cause \\(A\\), \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) can\ntogether cause \\(C\\) and nothing else characterizes \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have the same causative role. Therefore, in pure\ndispositionalism, they turn out to be identical, against the\nhypothesis (Hawthorne 2001; see also Contessa 2019). Fourthly,\naccording to some, pure dispositionalism falls prey to (at least)\nthree distinct regresses (for a fourth regress, see Psillos 2006).\nSuch regresses arise from the fact that the essential causative role\nof a dispositional property \\(P\\) “points towards” further\nproperties \\(S\\), \\(T\\), etc. qua possible effects. The\nessential causative roles of the latter “point towards”\nstill other properties, and so on. The first regress concerns the\nidentity of \\(P\\), which is never fixed, as it depends on the identity\nof further properties, which depend for their identity on still other\nproperties, and so on (Lowe 2006; Barker 2009; 2013). The second\nregress concerns the knowability of \\(P\\) (Swinburne 1980). \\(P\\) is\nonly knowable through its possible effects (i.e., the instantiation of\n\\(S\\), \\(T\\), etc.), included in its causative role. Yet, such\npossible effects are only knowable through their possible effects, and\nso on. The third regress concerns the actuality of \\(P\\) (Armstrong\n1997). \\(P\\)’s actuality is never reached, since \\(P\\) is\nnothing but the power to give rise to \\(S\\), \\(T\\), etc., which are\nnothing but the powers to give rise to further properties, and so on.\nFor responses to these regresses, see Molnar 2003; Marmodoro 2009;\nBauer 2012; McKitrick 2013; see also Ingthorsson 2013. \nPure categoricalism seems to imply that causative roles are only\ncontingently associated to a property. Therefore, on pure\ncategoricalism, a property can possibly have distinct causative roles,\nwhich allows it to explain—among other things—the apparent\ncontingency of causative roles and the possibility of recombining a\nproperty with distinct causative roles. Its supporters include Lewis\n(1986b, 2009), Armstrong (1999), Schaffer (2005), and more recently\nLivanios (2017), who provides further arguments based on the\nmetaphysics of science. Kelly (2009) and Smith (2016) may be added to\nthe list, although they take roles to be non-essential and necessary\n(for further options, see also Kimpton-Nye 2018, Yates 2018a, Coates\nforthcoming and Tugby forthcoming). \nHowever, pure categoricalism falls prey to two sorts of difficulties.\nFirst, the contingency of causative roles has some unpalatable\nconsequences: unbeknownst to us, two distinct properties can swap\ntheir roles; they can play the same role at the same time; the same\nrole can be played by one property at one time and by another property\nat a later time; an “alien” property can replace a\nfamiliar one by playing its role (Black 2000). Secondly, and more\ngenerally, we are never able to know which properties play which\nroles, nor are we able to know the intrinsic nature of such\nproperties. This consequence should be accepted with “Ramseyan\nhumility” (Lewis 2009; see also Langton 1998 for a related,\nKantian, sort of humility) or it should be countered in the same way\nas we decide to counter any broader version of skepticism (Schaffer\n2005). On this issue, see also Whittle (2006); Locke (2009); Kelly\n(2013); Yates (2018b). \nLet us now turn to some intermediate positions. \nAccording to dualism (Ellis 2001; Molnar 2003), there are\nboth dispositional and categorical properties. Dualism is meant to\ncombine the virtues of pure dispositionalism and pure categoricalism.\nIt then faces the charge of adopting a less parsimonious ontology,\nsince it accepts two classes of properties rather than one, i.e.,\ndispositional and categorical ones. \nAccording to the identity theory (Heil 2003; 2012; Jaworski\n2016; Martin 2008; G. Strawson 2008; see also N. Williams 2019), every\nproperty is both dispositional and categorical (or qualitative). The\nmain problem here is how to characterize the distinction and relation\nof these two “sides”. Martin and Heil suggest that they\nare two distinct ways of partially considering one and the same\nproperty, whereas Mumford (1998) explores the possibility of seeing\nthem as two distinct ways of conceptualizing the property in question.\nHeil claims that the qualitative and the dispositional sides need to\nbe identified with one another and with the whole property. Jacobs\n(2011) holds that the qualitative side consists in the possession of\nsome qualitative nature by the property, whereas the dispositional\nside consists in that property being (part of) a sufficient truthmaker\nfor certain counterfactuals. Dispositional and qualitative sides may\nalso be seen as essential, higher-order properties of properties, as\nsupervenient and ontologically innocent aspects of properties\n(Giannotti 2019), or as constituents of the essence of properties\n(Taylor 2018). In general, the identity theory is between Scylla and\nCharybdis. If it reifies the dispositional and qualitative sides, it\nruns the risk of implying some sort of dualism. If it insists on the\nidentity between them, it runs the opposite risk of turning into a\npure dispositionalist theory (Taylor 2018). \nFormal property theories are logical systems that aim at formulating\n“general noncontingent laws that deal with properties”\n(Bealer & Mönnich 1989: 133). In the next subsection we shall\noutline how they work. In the two subsequent subsections we shall\nbriefly consider their deployment in natural language semantics and\nthe foundations of mathematics, which can be taken to provide further\nreasons for the acknowledgment of properties in one’s ontology,\nor at least of certain kinds of properties. \nThese systems allow for terms corresponding to properties, in\nparticular variables that are meant to range over properties and that\ncan be quantified over. This can be achieved in two ways. Either\n(option 1; Cocchiarella 1986a) the terms standing for properties are\npredicates or (option 2; Bealer 1982) such terms are subject terms\nthat can be linked to other subject terms by a special predicate that\nis meant to express a predication relation (let us use\n“pred”) pretty much as in standard set theory a special\npredicate, “\\(\\in\\)”, is used to express the membership\nrelation. To illustrate, given the former option, an assertion such as\n“there is a property that both John and Mary have” can be\nrendered as \\[\\notag \\exists P(P(j) \\amp P(m)).\\] \nGiven the second option, it can be rendered as \\[\\notag \\exists x(\\textrm{pred}(x, j) \\amp \\textrm{pred}(x, m)).\\] \n(The two options can be combined as in Menzel 1986; see Menzel 1993\nfor further discussion). \nWhatever option one follows, in spelling out such theories one\ntypically postulates a rich realm of properties. Traditionally, this\nis done by a so-called comprehension principle which, intuitively,\nasserts that, for any well-formed formula (“wff”) \\(A\\),\nwith \\(n\\) free variables, \\(x_1 , \\ldots ,x_n\\), there is a\ncorresponding \\(n\\)-adic property. Following option 1, it goes as\nfollows: \\[\\tag{CP} \\exists R^n \\forall x_1 \\ldots \\forall x_n(R^n(x_1 ,\n\\ldots ,x_n) \\leftrightarrow A). \\] \nAlternatively, one can use a variable-binding operator, \\(\\lambda\\),\nthat, given an open wff, generates a term (called a “lambda\nabstract”) that is meant to stand for a property. This way to\nproceed is more flexible and is followed in the most recent versions\nof property theory. We shall thus stick to it in the following. To\nillustrate, we can apply “\\(\\lambda\\)” to the open\nformula, “\\((R(x) \\amp S(x))\\)” to form the one-place\ncomplex predicate “[\\(\\lambda x (R(x) \\amp S(x))\\)]”; if\n“\\(R\\)” denotes being red and “\\(S\\)”\ndenotes being square, then this complex predicate denotes the\ncompound, conjunctive property being red and square.\nSimilarly, we can apply the operator to the open formula\n“\\(\\exists y(L(x, y))\\)” to form the one-place predicate\n“[\\(\\lambda x \\exists y(L(x, y))\\)]”; if\n“\\(L\\)” stands for loves, this complex predicate\ndenotes the compound property loving someone (whereas\n“[\\(\\lambda y \\exists x(L(x, y))\\)]” would denote\nbeing loved by someone). To ensure that lambda abstracts\ndesignate the intended property, one should assume a “principle\nof lambda conversion”. Given option 1, it can be stated\nthus: \\[\\tag{\\(\\lambda\\)-conv} [\\lambda x_1\\ldots x_n A](t_1 , \\ldots\n,t_n) \\leftrightarrow A(x_1 /t_1 , \\ldots ,x_n /t_n).\\] \n\\(A(x_1 /t_1 , \\ldots ,x_n /t_n)\\) is the wff resulting from\nsimultaneously replacing each \\(x_i\\) in \\(A\\) with \\(t_i\\) (for \\(1\n\\le i \\le n)\\), provided \\(t_i\\) is free for \\(x_i\\) in \\(A\\)). For\nexample, given this principle, [\\(\\lambda x (R(x) \\amp S(x))](j)\\) is\nthe case iff \\((R(j) \\amp S(j))\\) is also the case. \nStandard second-order logic allows for predicate variables bound by\nquantifiers. Hence, to the extent that these variables are taken to\nrange over properties, this system could be seen as a formal theory of\nproperties. Its expressive power is however limited, since it does not\nallow for subject terms that stand for properties. Thus, for example,\none cannot even say of a property \\(F\\) that \\(F = F\\). This is a\nserious limitation if one wants a formal tool for a realm of\nproperties whose laws one is trying to explore. Standard higher order\nlogics beyond the second order obviate this limitation by allowing for\npredicates in subject position, provided that the predicates that are\npredicated of them belong to a higher type. This presupposes a grammar\nin which predicates are assigned types of increasing levels, which can\nbe taken to mean that the properties themselves, for which the\npredicates stand for, are arranged into a hierarchy of types. Thus,\nsuch logics appropriate one version or another of the type theory\nconcocted by Russell to tame his own paradox and related conundrums.\nIf a predicate can be predicated of another predicate only if the\nformer is of a type higher than the latter, then self-predication is\nbanished and Russell’s paradox cannot even be formulated.\nFollowing this line, we can construct a type-theoretical formal\nproperty theory. The simple theory of types, as presented, e.g., in\nCopi (1971), can be seen as a prototypical version of such a property\ntheory (if we neglect the principle of extensionality assumed by\nCopi). The type-theoretical approach keeps having supporters. For\nexample, it is followed in the property theories embedded in\nZalta’s (1983) theory of abstract objects and more recently in\nthe metaphysical systems proposed by Williamson (2013) and Hale\n(2013). \nHowever, for reasons sketched in\n §2.4,\n type theory is hardly satisfactory. Accordingly, many type-free\nversions of property theory have been developed over the years and no\nconsensus on what the right strategy is appears to be in sight. Of\ncourse, without type-theoretical constraints, given \\((\\lambda\\)-conv)\nand classical logic (CL), paradoxes such as Russell’s\nimmediately follow (to see this, consider this instance of\n\\((\\lambda\\textrm{-conv}): [\\lambda x {\\sim}x(x)]([\\lambda x\n{\\sim}x(x)]) \\leftrightarrow{\\sim}[\\lambda x {\\sim}x(x)]([\\lambda x\n{\\sim}x(x)])\\)). In formal systems where abstract singular terms or\npredicates may (but need not) denote properties (Swoyer 1998), formal\ncounterparts of (complex) predicates like “being a property that\ndoes not exemplify itself” (formally, “[\\(\\lambda x\n{\\sim}x(x)\\)]”) could exist in the object language without\ndenoting properties; from this perspective, Russell’s paradox\nmerely shows that such predicates do not stand for properties\n(similarly, according to Schnieder 2017, it shows that it is not\npossible that a certain property exists). But we would like to have\ngeneral criteria to decide when a predicate stands for a property and\nwhen it does not. Moreover, one may wonder what gives these predicates\nany significance at all if they do not stand for properties. There are\nthen motivations for building type-free property theories in which all\npredicates stand for properties. We can distinguish two main strands\nof them: those that weaken CL and those that circumscribe\n\\((\\lambda\\)-conv) (some of the proposals to be mentioned below are\nformulated in relation to set theory, but can be easily translated\ninto proposals for property theory). \nAn early example of the former approach was offered in a 1938 paper by\nthe Russian logician D. A. Bochvar (Bochvar 1938 [1981]), where the\nprinciple of excluded middle is sacrificed as a consequence of the\nadoption of what is now known as Kleene’s weak three-valued\nscheme. An interesting recent attempt based on giving up excluded\nmiddle is Field 2004. A rather radical alternative proposal is to\nembrace a paraconsistent logic and give up the principle of\nnon-contradiction (Priest 1987). A different way of giving up CL is by\nquestioning its structural rules and turn to a substructural logic, as\nin Mares and Paoli (2014). The problem with all these approaches is\nwhether their underlying logic is strong enough for all the intended\napplications of property theory, in particular to natural language\nsemantics and the foundations of mathematics. \nAs for the second strand (based on circumscribing \\((\\lambda\\)-conv)),\nit has been proposed to read the axioms of a standard set theory such\nas ZFC, minus extensionality, as if they were about properties rather\nthan sets (Schock 1969; Bealer 1982; Jubien 1989). The problem with\nthis is that these axioms, understood as talking about sets, can be\nmotivated by the iterative conception of sets, but they seem rather\nad hoc when understood as talking about properties\n(Cocchiarella 1985). An alternative can be found in Cocchiarella\n1986a, where \\((\\lambda\\)-conv) is circumscribed by adapting to\nproperties the notion of stratification used by Quine for sets. This\napproach is however subject to a version of Russell’s paradox\nderivable from contingent but intuitively possible facts (Orilia 1996)\nand to a paradox of hyperintensionality (Bozon 2004) (see Landini 2009\nand Cocchiarella 2009 for a discussion of both). Orilia (2000; Orilia\n& Landini 2019) has proposed another strategy for circumscribing\n\\((\\lambda\\)-conv), based on applying to exemplification Gupta’s\nand Belnap’s theory of circular definitions. \nIndependently of the paradoxes (Bealer & Mönnich 1989: 198\nff.), there is the issue of providing identity conditions for\nproperties, specifying when it is the case that two properties are\nidentical. If one thinks of properties as meanings of natural language\npredicates and tries to account for intensional contexts, one will be\ninclined to assume rather fine-grained identity conditions, possibly\neven allowing that [\\(\\lambda x(R(x) \\amp S(x))\\)] and [\\(\\lambda\nx(S(x) \\amp R(x))\\)] are distinct (see Fox & Lappin 2015 for an\napproach based on operational distinctions among computable\nfunctions). On the other hand, if one thinks of properties as causally\noperative entities in the physical world, one will want to provide\nrather coarse-grained identity conditions. For instance, one might\nrequire that [\\(\\lambda x A\\)] and [\\(\\lambda x B\\)] are the same\nproperty iff it is physically necessary that \\(\\forall x(A\n\\leftrightarrow B)\\). Bealer (1982) tries to combine the two\napproaches (see also Bealer & Mönnich\n 1989)[15]. \nThe formal study of natural language semantics started with Montague\nand gave rise to a flourishing field of inquiry (see entry on\n Montague semantics).\n The basic idea in this field is to associate to natural language\nsentences wffs of a formal language, in order to represent sentence\nmeanings in a logically perspicuous manner. The association reflects\nthe compositionality of meanings: different syntactic subcomponents of\nsentences correspond systematically to syntactic subcomponents of the\nwffs; subcomponents of wffs thus represent the meanings of the\nsubcomponents of the sentences. The formal language eschews\nambiguities and has its own formal semantics, which grants that\nformulas have logical properties and relations, such as logical truth\nand entailments, so that in particular certain sequences of formulas\ncount as logically valid arguments. The ambiguities we normally find\nin natural language sentences and the entailment relations that link\nthem are captured by associating ambiguous sentences to different\nunambiguous wffs, in such a way that when a natural language argument\nis felt to be valid there is a corresponding sequence of wffs that\ncount as a logically valid argument. In order to achieve all this,\nMontague appealed to a higher-order logic. To see why this was\nnecessary, one may focus on this valid argument: \ntherefore, \nTo grant compositionality in a way that respects the syntactic\nsimilarity of the three sentences (they all have the same\nsubject-predicate form), and the validity of the argument, Montague\nassociates (1)–(3) to formulas such as these: \\[ \\tag{1a} [\\lambda F \\forall x(\\mathrm{G}(x) \\rightarrow\nF(x)](\\mathrm{M}); \\] \\[ \\tag{2a} [\\lambda F \\exists x(\\forall y(P(x)\n\\rightarrow x = y) \\amp F(x))](G); \\] \\[ \\tag{3a} [\\lambda F \\exists\nx(\\forall y(P(x) \\rightarrow x = y) \\amp F(x))](\\mathrm{M}). \\] \nThe three lambda abstracts in (1a)–(3a) represent, respectively,\nthe meanings of the three noun phrases in (1)–(3). These\nlambda-abstracts occur in predicate position, as predicates of\npredicates, so that (1a)–(3a) can be read, respectively, as:\nevery Greek is instantiated by being mortal; the\npresident of Greece is instantiated by being Greek;\nthe president of Greece is instantiated by being\nmortal. Given lambda-conversion plus quantifier and propositional\nlogic, the argument is valid, as desired. It should be noted that\nlambda abstracts such as these can be taken to stand for peculiar\nproperties of properties, classifiable as denoting concepts\n(after Russell 1903; see Cocchiarella 1989). One may then say then\nthis approach to semantics makes a case for the postulation of\ndenoting concepts, in addition to the more obvious and general fact\nthat it grants properties as meanings of natural language predicates\n(represented by symbols of the formal language). \nThis in itself says nothing about the nature of such properties. As we\nsaw in\n §3.1,\n Montague took them to be intensions as set-theoretically\ncharacterized in terms of possible worlds. Moreover, he took them to\nbe typed, since, to avoid logical paradoxes, he relied on type theory.\nAfter Montague, these two assumptions have been typically taken for\ngranted in natural language semantics, though with attempts to recover\nhyperintensionality somehow (Cresswell 1985) in order to capture the\nsemantics of propositional attitudes verbs such as\n“believe”, affected by the phenomena regarding mental\ncontent hinted at in\n §3.1.\n However, the development of type-free property theories has suggested\nthe radically different road of relying on them to provide logical\nforms for natural language semantics (Chierchia 1985; Chierchia &\nTurner 1988; Orilia 2000b; Orilia & Landini 2019). This allows one\nto capture straightforwardly natural language inferences that appear\nto presuppose type-freedom, as they feature quantifiers that bind\nsimultaneously subject and predicate positions (recall the example of\n §1.2).\n Moreover, by endowing the selected type-free property theory with\nfine-grained identity conditions, one also accounts for propositional\nattitude verbs (Bealer 1989). Thus, we may say that this line makes a\ncase for properties understood as untyped and highly fine-grained. \nSince the systematization in the first half of last century, which\ngave rise to paradox-free axiomatizations of set\ntheory such as ZFC, sets are\ntypically taken for granted in the foundations of mathematics and it\nis well known that they can do all the works that numbers can do. This\nhas led to the proposal of identifying numbers with sets.\nRussell’s type theory was an alternative that rather relied on\nproperties (viewed as propositional functions), in backing up a\nlogicist reduction of mathematics to logic. In essence, the idea was\nthat properties can do all the work that sets are supposed to do, thus\nmaking the latter dispensable. Hence, Russell spoke of his approach as\na “no-classes” theory of classes (see Landini 2011: 115,\nand §2.4 of the entry on\n Russell’s logical atomism;\n cf. Bealer 1982: 111–119, and Jubien 1989 for followers of this\nline). Following this line, numbers are then seen as properties rather\nthan sets. \nThe Russellian approach did not encounter among mathematicians a\nsuccess comparable to that of set theory. Nevertheless, from an\nontological point of view, it appears to be more economical in its\nrelying on properties, to the extent that the latter are needed any\nway for all sorts of explanatory jobs, reviewed above, which sets,\nqua extensional entities, can hardly perform. As we have\nseen, type theory is problematic. However, type-free property theories\ncan come to the rescue by replacing typed properties with untyped ones\nin the foundations of mathematics. And in fact the advocates of such\ntheories have often proposed to recover the logicist program, in\nparticular by identifying natural numbers with untyped properties of\nproperties (Bealer 1982; Cocchiarella 1986b; Orilia 2000b). (See also\nentry on\n logicism and neologicism).","contact.mail":"orilia@unimc.it","contact.domain":"unimc.it"},{"date.published":"1999-09-23","date.changed":"2020-11-25","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/","author1":"Francesco Orilia","author1.info":"http://michelepaolinipaoletti.academia.edu","entry":"properties","body.text":"\n\n\nProperties are those entities that can be predicated of\nthings or, in other words, attributed to them. Thus,\nproperties are often called predicables. Other terms for them\nare “attributes”, “qualities”,\n“features”, “characteristics”,\n“types”. Properties are also ways things are, entities\nthat things exemplify or instantiate. For example,\nif we say that this is a leaf and is green, we are attributing the\nproperties leaf and green to it, and, if the\npredication is veridical, the thing in question exemplifies these\nproperties. Hence, properties can also be characterized as\nexemplifiables, with the controversial exception of those\nthat cannot be instantiated, e.g., some would say, round and\nsquare. It is typically assumed that no other entities can be\npredicated and exemplified (Aristotle, Categories, 2a). For\nexample, ordinary objects like apples and chairs cannot be predicated\nof, and are not exemplified by, anything.\n\n\nThe nature and existence of properties have always been central and\ncontroversial issues in philosophy since its origin, and interest in\nthem keeps flourishing, as Allen’s (2016) recent introductory\ntext well testifies (see also surveys or anthologies such as Loux\n1972; Oliver 1996; Mellor and Oliver 1997; Koons and Pickavance 2017;\nMarmodoro and Mayr 2019). At least since Plato, who called them\n“ideas” or “forms”, properties are viewed as\nuniversals, i.e., as capable, (in typical cases) of being\ninstantiated by different objects, “shared” by them, as it\nwere; consequently, in contrast with particulars, or\nindividuals, of being somehow at once in different\n places.[1]\n For example, if there are two potatoes each of which weighs 300\ngrams, the property weighing 300 grams is instantiated by two\nparticulars and is therefore multi-located. According to a different\nconception, however, properties are themselves particulars, though\nabstract ones. As so conceived, properties are nowadays\ncommonly called\n tropes,\n and are the subject of another entry. Here we shall focus on\nproperties as universals. Relations, e.g., loving and\nbetween, can also be considered properties: they are\npredicable, exemplifiable, and viewable as universals. Accordingly, we\nuse “property” as a generic term that also covers them,\nunless the context suggests otherwise. However, we shall consider\ntheir peculiarity only to a minimum extent, since they are discussed\nin detail in the entry on\n relations.\n \n\nIn §1 we consider some most fundamental themes, including the\nmain motivations and arguments for including properties in one’s\nontology. In §2 we deal with the central topic of what it is for\nproperties to be exemplified. In §3 we tackle the intertwined\nissues of the existence and identity conditions for properties. In\n§4 we consider different senses in which properties may be\nstructurally complex. In §5 we survey the frequent appeal to\nproperties in current metaphysics of science. In §6 we conclude\nwith a review of formal accounts of properties and their applications\nin natural language semantics and the foundations of mathematics,\nwhich provide additional motivations for an ontological commitment to\nproperties.\n\nThere are some crucial terminological and conceptual distinctions that\nare typically made in talking of properties. There are also various\nsorts of reasons that have been adduced for the existence of\nproperties and different traditional views about whether and in what\nsense properties should be acknowledged. We shall focus on such\nmatters in the following subsections. \nProperties are expressed, as meanings, by\npredicates. In the past “predicate” was often\nused as synonym of “property”, but nowadays predicates are\nlinguistic entities, typically contrasted with singular\nterms, i.e., simple or complex noun phrases such as\n“Daniel”, “this horse” or “the President\nof France”, which can occupy subject positions in sentences and\npurport to denote, or refer to, a single thing.\nFollowing Frege, predicates are verbal phrases such as\n“is French” or “drinks”. Alternatively,\npredicates are general terms such as “French”,\nwith the copula “is” (or verbal inflection) taken to\nconvey an exemplification link (P. Strawson 1959; Bergmann 1960). We\nshall conveniently use “predicate” in both ways.\nPredicates are predicated of singular terms, thereby\ngenerating sentences such as “Daniel is French”. In the\nfamiliar formal language of first-order logic, this would be rendered,\nsay, as “\\(F(d)\\)”, thus representing the predicate with a\ncapital letter. The set or class of objects to which a predicate\nveridically applies is often called the extension of the\npredicate, or of the corresponding property. This property, in\ncontrast, is called the intension of the predicate, i.e., its\nmeaning. This terminology traces back to the Middle Age and in the\nlast century has led to the habit of calling sets and properties\nextensional and intensional entities, respectively.\nExtensions and intensions can hardly be identified; this is\nimmediately suggested by paradigmatic examples of co-extensional\npredicates that appear to differ in meaning, such as “has a\nheart”, and “has kidneys” (see\n §3.1). \nProperties can also be referred to by singular terms, or so it seems.\nFirst of all, there are singular terms, e.g., “being\nhonest” or “honesty”, that result from the\nnominalization of predicates, such as “is honest”\nor “honest” (some think that “being \\(F\\)” and\n“\\(F\\)-ness” stand for different kinds of property\n(Levinson 1991). Further, there are definite descriptions, such as\n“Mary’s favorite property”. Finally, though more\ncontroversially, there are demonstratives, such as “that shade\nof red”, deployed while pointing to a red object (Heal\n1997). \nFrege (1892) and Russell (1903) had different opinions regarding the\nontological import of nominalization. According to the former,\nnominalized predicates stand for a “correlate” of the\n“unsaturated” entity that the predicate stands for (in\nFrege’s terminology they are a “concept correlate”\nand a “concept”, respectively). According to the latter,\nwho speaks of “inextricable difficulties” in Frege’s\nview (Russell 1903: §49), they stand for exactly the same entity.\nMutatis mutandis, they similarly disagreed about other\nsingular terms that seemingly refer to properties. The ontological\ndistinction put forward by Frege is mainly motivated by the fact that\ngrammar indeed forbids the use of predicates in subject position. But\nthis hardly suffices for the distinction and it is dubious that other\nmotivations can be marshalled (Parsons 1986). We shall thus take for\ngranted Russell’s line here, although many philosophers support\nFrege’s view or at least take it very seriously\n(Castañeda 1976; Cocchiarella 1986a; Landini 2008). \nProperties are typically invoked to explain phenomena of philosophical\ninterest. The most traditional task for which properties have been\nappealed to is to provide a solution to the so-called “one over\nmany problem” via a corresponding “one over many\nargument”. This traces back at least to Socrates and Plato\n(e.g., Phaedo, 100 c-d) and keeps being rehearsed (Russell\n1912: ch. 9; Butchvarov 1966; Armstrong 1978a: ch. 7; Loux 1998:\nch.1). The problem is that certain things are many, they are\nnumerically different, and yet they are somehow one: they appear to be\nsimilar, in a way that suggests a uniform classification, their being\ngrouped together into a single class. For example, some objects have\nthe same shape, certain others have the same color, and still others\nthe same weight. Hence, the argument goes, something is needed to\nexplain this phenomenon and properties fill the bill: the objects in\nthe first group, say, all have the property spherical, those\nin the second red, and those in the third weighing 200\ngrams. \nRelatedly, properties have been called for to explain our use of\ngeneral terms. How is it, e.g., that we apply “spherical”\nto those balls over there and refuse to do it for the nearby bench? It\ndoes not seem to be due to an arbitrary decision concerning where, or\nwhere not, to stick a certain label. It seems rather the case that the\nrecognition of a certain property in some objects but not in others\nelicits the need for a label, “spherical”, which is then\nused for objects having that property and not for others. Properties\nare thus invoked as meanings of general terms and\npredicates (Plato, Phaedo, 78e; Russell 1912: ch.\n9). In contrast with this, Quine (1948; 1953 [1980: 11, 21, 131] )\ninfluentially argued that the use of general terms and predicates in\nitself does not involve an ontological commitment to entities\ncorresponding to them, since it is by deploying singular terms that we\npurport to refer to something (see also Sellars 1960). However, as\nnoted, predicates can be nominalized and thus occur as singular terms.\nHence, even if one agrees with Quine, nominalized predicates still\nsuggest the existence of properties as their referents, at least to\nthe extent that the use of nominalized predicates cannot be\nparaphrased away (Loux 2006: 25–34; entry on\n platonism in metaphysics, §4). \nAfter Quine (1948), quantificational idiom is the landmark of\nontological commitment. We can thus press the point even more by\nnoting that we make claims and construct arguments that appear to\ninvolve quantification over properties, with quantifiers reaching (i)\nover predicate positions, or even (ii) over both subject and predicate\npositions (Castañeda\n 1976).[2]\n As regards (i), consider: this apple is red; this tomato is red;\nhence, there is something that this apple is and this tomato also is.\nAs for (ii), consider: wisdom is more important than beauty; Mary is\nwise and Elisabeth is beautiful; hence, there is something that Mary\nis which is more important than something that Elisabeth is. \nQuantification over properties seems ubiquitous not just in ordinary\ndiscourse but in science as well. For example, the inverse square law\nfor dynamics and the reduction of temperature to mean molecular energy\ncan be taken to involve quantification over properties such as masses,\ndistances and temperatures: the former tells us that the attraction\nforce between any two bodies depends on such bodies’ having\ncertain masses and being at a certain distance, and the latter informs\nus that the fact that a sample of gas has a given temperature depends\non its having such and such mean kinetic energy. \nSwoyer (1999: §3.2) considers these points within a long list of\narguments that have been, or can be, put forward to motivate an\nontological commitment to properties. He touches on topics such as\na priori knowledge, change, causation, measurement, laws of\nnature, intensional logic, natural language semantics, numbers (we\nshall cover some of this territory in\n §5\n and\n §6). \nDespite all this, whether, and in what sense, properties should be\nadmitted in one’s ontology appears to be a perennial issue,\ntraditionally shaped as a controversy about the existence of\nuniversals. \nDo universals really exist? There are three long-standing answers to\nthis question: realism, nominalism, and\nconceptualism. \nAccording to realists, universals exist as mind-independent entities.\nIn transcendent realism, put forward by Plato, they exist\neven if uninstantiated and are thus “transcendent” or\n“ante res” (“before the things”). In\nimmanent realism, defended by Aristotle in opposition to his\nmaster, they are “immanent” or “in\nrebus” (“in things”), as they exist only if\ninstantiated by objects. Contemporary notable supporters are Russell\n(1912) for the former and Armstrong (1978a) for the latter (for recent\ntakes on this old dispute see the essays by Loux, Van Inwagen, Lowe\nand Galluzzo in Galluzzo & Loux 2015). Transcendentism is of\ncourse a less economical position and elicits epistemological worries\nregarding our capacity to grasp ante res universals.\nNevertheless, such worries may be countered in various ways (cf. entry\non\n platonism in metaphysics, §5;\n Bealer 1982: 19–20; 1998: §2; Linsky & Zalta 1995),\nand uninstantiated properties may well have work to do, particularly\nin capturing the intuitive idea that there are unrealized\npossibilities and in dealing with cognitive content (see\n §3).\n A good summary of pro-transcendentist arguments and immanentist\nrejoinders is offered by Allen (2016: §2.3). See also Costa\nforthcoming for a new criticism of immanentism, based on the\nnotion of grounding. \nNominalists eschew mind-independent universals. They may either resort\nto tropes in their stead, or accept predicate nominalism,\nwhich tries to make it without mind-independent properties at all, by\ntaking the predicates themselves to do the classifying job that\nproperties are supposed to do. This is especially indigestible to a\nrealist, since it seems to put the cart before the horse by making\nlanguage and mind responsible for the similarities we find in the rich\nvarieties of things surrounding us. Some even say that this involves\nan idealist rejection of a mind-independent world (Hochberg 2013).\nConceptualists also deny that there are mind-independent universals,\nand because of this they are often assimilated to nominalists. Still,\nthey can be distinguished insofar as they replace such universals with\nconcepts, understood as non-linguistic mind-dependent entities,\ntypically functioning as meanings of predicates. The mind-dependence\nof concepts however makes conceptualism liable to the same kind of\ncart/horse worry just voiced above in relation to predicate\n nominalism.[3] \nThe arguments considered in\n §1.2\n constitute the typical motivation for realism, which is the stance\nthat we take for granted here. They may be configured as an abductive\ninference to the best explanation (Swoyer 1999). Thus, of course, they\nare not foolproof, and in fact nominalism is still a popular view,\nwhich is discussed in detail in the entry on\n nominalism in metaphysics,\n as well as in the entry on\n tropes.\n Conceptualism appears to be less common nowadays, although it still\nhas supporters (cf. Cocchiarella 1986a: ch. 3; 2007), and it is worth\nnoting that empirical research on concepts is flourishing. \nWe have talked above in a way that might give the impression that\npredication is an activity that we perform, e.g., when we say\nor think that a certain apple is red. Although some philosophers might\nthink of it in this way, predication, or attribution, may\nalso be viewed as a special link that connects a property to a thing\nin a way that gives rise to\na propositions, understood as a complex\nfeaturing the property and the thing (or concepts of them) as\nconstituents with different roles: the latter occurs in the\nproposition as logical subject or argument, as is\noften said, and the former as attributed to such an argument.\nIf the proposition is true (the predication is veridical), the\nargument exemplifies the property, viz. the former is an instance of\nthe latter. The idea that properties yield propositions when\nappropriately connected to an argument motivates Russell’s\n(1903) introduction of the term\n“propositional\nfunction” to speak of properties. We\ntake for granted here that predication is univocal. However, according\nto some neo-Meinongian philosophers, there are two modes of\npredication, sometimes characterized as “external” and\n“internal” (Castañeda 1972; Rapaport 1978; Zalta\n1983; see entry on\n nonexistent objects).\n Zalta (1983) traces back the distinction to Mally and uses\n“exemplification” to characterize the former and\n“encoding” to characterize the latter. Roughly, the idea\nis that non-existent objects may encode properties that existent\nobjects exemplify. For instance, winged is exemplified by\nthat bird over and is encoded by the winged horse. \nIt is often assumed nowadays that, when an object exemplifies a\nproperty, there is a further, complex, entity, a fact or state of\naffairs (Bergmann 1960; Armstrong 1997, entries on\n facts\n and\n states of affairs),\n having the property (qua attributed) and the object\n(qua argument) as constituents (this compositional conception\nis not always accepted; see, e.g., Bynoe 2011 for a dissenting voice).\nFacts are typically taken to fulfill the theoretical roles of\ntruthmakers (the entities that make true propositions true, see entry\non\n truthmakers)\n and causal relata (the entities connected by causal\nrelations; see entry on\n the metaphysics of causation, §1).\n Not all philosophers, however, distinguish between propositions and\nstates of affairs; Russell (1903) acknowledges only propositions and,\nfor a more recent example, so does Gaskin (2008). \nIt appears that properties can have a double role that no other\nentities can have: they can occur in propositions and facts both as\narguments and as attributed (Russell 1903: §48). For example, in\ntruly saying that this apple is red and that red is a color, we\nexpress a proposition wherein red occurs as attributed, and\nanother proposition wherein red occurs as argument.\nCorrespondingly, there are two facts with red in both roles,\nrespectively. This duplicity grounds the common distinction between\ndifferent orders or types of properties:\nfirst-order ones are properties of things that are not\nthemselves predicables; second-order ones are properties of\nfirst-order properties; and so on. Even though the formal and\nontological issues behind this terminology are controversial, it is\nwidely used and is often connected to the subdivision between\nfirst-order and higher-order logics (see, e.g., Thomason 1974; Oliver\n1996; Williamson 2013; entry on\n type theory).\n It originates from Frege’s and Russell’s logical\ntheories, especially Russell’s type theory, wherein distinctions\nof types and orders are rigidly regimented in order to circumvent the\nlogical paradoxes (see\n §6). \nA relation is typically attributed to a plurality of objects. These\njointly instantiate the relation in question, if the\nattribution is veridical. In this case, the relata (as\narguments) and the relation (as attributed) are constituents of a\nstate of affairs. Depending on the number of objects that it can\nrelate, a relation is usually taken to have a number of\n“places” or a “degree” (“adicity”,\n“arity”), and is thus called “dyadic”\n(“two-place”), “triadic”\n(“three-place”), etc. For example, before and\nbetween are dyadic (of degree 2) and triadic (of degree 3),\nrespectively. In line with this, properties and propositions are\n“monadic” and “zero-adic” predicables, as they\nare predicated of one, and of no, object, respectively, and may then\nbe seen as limiting cases of relations (Bealer 1982, where properties,\nrelations and propositions are suggestively grouped under the acronym\n“PRP;” Dixon 2018; Menzel 1986; 1993; Swoyer 1998; Orilia\n1999; Van Inwagen 2004; 2015; Zalta 1983). This terminology is also\napplied to predicates and sentences; for example, the predicate\n“between” is triadic, and the sentence “Peter is\nbetween Tom and May” is zero-adic. Accordingly, standard\nfirst-order logic employs predicates with a fixed degree, typically\nindicated by a superscript, e.g., \\(P^1\\), \\(Q^2\\), \\(R^3\\), etc. \nIn natural language, however, many predicates appear to be\nmultigrade or variably polyadic; i.e., they can be\nused with different numbers of arguments, as they can be true of\nvarious numbers of things. For example, we say “John is lifting\na table”, with “lifting” used as dyadic, as well as\n“John and Mary are lifting a table”, with\n“lifting” used as triadic. Moreover, there is a kind of\ninference, called “argument deletion”, which also suggests\nthat many predicates that prima facie could be assigned a\ncertain fixed degree are in fact multigrade. For example, “John\nis eating a cake” suggests that “is eating” is\ndyadic, but since, by argument deletion, it entails “John is\neating”, one could conclude that it is also monadic and thus\nmultigrade. Often one can resist the conclusion that there are\nmultigrade predicates. For example, it could be said that “John\nis eating” is simply short for “John is eating\nsomething”. But it seems hard to find a systematic and\nconvincing strategy that allows us to maintain that natural language\npredicates have a fixed degree. This has motivated the construction of\nlogical languages that feature multigrade predicates in order to\nprovide a more appropriate formal account of natural language (Grandy\n1976; Graves 1993; Orilia 2000a). Since natural language predicates\nappear to be multigrade, one may be tempted to take the properties and\nrelations that they express to also be multigrade, and the metaphysics\nof science may lend support to this conclusion (Mundy 1989). \nSeemingly, relations are not jointly instantiated\nsimpliciter; how the instantiation occurs also plays\na role. This comes to the fore in particular with non-symmetric\nrelations such as loving. For example, if John loves Mary,\nthen loving is jointly instantiated by John and Mary in a\ncertain way, whereas if it is Mary who loves John, then\nloving is instantiated by John and Mary in another way.\nAccordingly, relations pose a special problem: explicating the\ndifference between facts, such as Abelard loves Eloise and\nEloise loves Abelard, that at least prima facie\ninvolve exactly the same constituents, namely a non-symmetric relation\nand two other items (loving, Abelard, Eloise). Such facts are\noften said to differ in “relational order” or in the\n“differential application” of the non-symmetric relation\nin question, and the problem then is that of characterizing what this\nrelational order or differential application amounts to. \nRussell (1903: §218) attributed an enormous importance to this\nissue and attacked it repeatedly. Despite this, it has been pretty\nmuch neglected until the end of last century, with only few others\nconfronting it systematically (e.g., Bergmann 1992; Hochberg 1987).\nHowever, Fine (2000) has forcefully brought it again on the\nontological agenda and proposed a novel approach that has received\nsome attention. Fine identifies standard and\npositionalist views (analogous to two approaches defended by\nRussell at different times (1903; 1984); cf. Orilia 2008). According\nto the former, relations are intrinsically endowed with a\n“direction”, which allows us to distinguish, e.g.,\nloving and being loved: Abelard loves\nEloise and Eloise loves Abelard differ, because they\ninvolve two relations that differ in direction (e.g., the former\ninvolves loving and the latter being loved).\nAccording to the latter, relations have different\n“positions” that can somehow host relata:\nAbelard loves Eloise and Eloise loves Abelard\ndiffer, because the two positions of the very same loving\nrelation are differently occupied (by Abelard and Eloise in one case\nand by Eloise and Abelard in the other case). Fine goes on to propose\nand endorse an alternative, “anti-positionalist”\nstandpoint, according to which relations have neither direction nor\npositions. The literature on this topic keeps growing and there are\nnow various proposals on the market, including new versions of\npositionalism (Orilia 2014; Donnelly 2016; Dixon 2018), and\nprimitivism, according to which differential application\ncannot be analyzed (MacBride 2014). \nRussell (1903: ch. 26) also had a key role in leading philosophers to\nacknowledge that at least some relations, in particular\nspatio-temporal ones, are external, i.e., cannot be reduced\nto monadic properties, or the mere existence, of the relata,\nin contrast to internal relations that can be so reduced. This was a\nbreakthrough after a long tradition tracing back at least to Aristotle\nand the Scholastics wherein there seems to be hardly any place for\nexternal relations (see entry on\n medieval theories of relations).[4] \nAccording to some philosophers, universals and tropes may coexist in\none ontological framework (see, e.g., Lowe 2006 for a well-known\ngeneral system of this kind, and Orilia 2006a, for a proposal based on\nempirical data from quantum mechanics). However, nowadays they are\ntypically seen as alternatives, with the typical supporter of\nuniversals (“universalist”) trying to do without tropes\n(e.g., Armstrong 1997) and the typical supporter of tropes\n(“tropist”) trying to dispense with universals (e.g.,\nMaurin\n 2002).[5]\n In order to clarify how differently they see matters, we may take\nadvantage of states of affairs. Both parties may agree, say, that\nthere are two red apples, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). They will immediately\ndisagree, however, for the universalist will add that \nThe tropist will reject these states of affairs with universals as\nconstituents and rather urge that there are two distinct tropes, the\nredness of \\(a\\) and the redness of \\(b\\), which play a theoretical\nrole analogous to the one that the universalist would invoke for such\nstates of affairs. Hence, tropists claim that tropes can be causal\nrelata (D. Williams 1953) and truthmakers (Mulligan, Simons, &\nSmith 1984). \nTropes are typically taken to be simple, i.e., without any\nsubconstituent (see Section 2.2 of the entry on\n tropes).\n Their playing the role of states of affairs with universals as\nconstituents depends on this: universals combine two functions, only\none of which is fulfilled by tropes. On the one hand, universals are\ncharacterizers, inasmuch as they characterize concrete\nobjects. On the other hand, they are also unifiers, to the\nextent that different concrete objects may be characterized by the\nvery same universal, which is thus somehow shared by all of them; when\nthis is the case, there is, according to the universalist, an\nobjective similarity among the different objects (see\n §1.2).\n In contrast, tropes are only characterizers, for, at least as\ntypically understood, they cannot be shared by distinct concrete\nobjects. Given its dependency on one specific object, say, the apple\n\\(a\\), a trope can do the work of a state of affairs with \\(a\\) as\nconstituent. But for tropes to play this role, the tropist will have\nto pay a price and introduce additional theoretical machinery to\naccount for objective similarities among concrete objects. To this\nend, she will typically resort to the idea that there are objective\nresemblances among tropes, which can then be grouped together in\nresemblance classes. These resemblance classes play the role of\nunifiers for the tropist. Hence, from the tropist’s point of\nview “property” is ambiguous, since it may stand for the\ncharacterizers (tropes) or for the unifiers (resemblance classes) (cf.\nentry on\n mental causation, §6.5).\n Similarly, “exemplification” and related words may be\nregarded as ambiguous insofar as they can be used either to indicate\nthat an object exemplifies a certain trope or to indicate that the\nobject relates to a certain resemblance class by virtue of\nexemplifying a trope in that\n class.[6] \nMany important and often controversial distinctions among different\nkinds of properties have been made throughout the whole history of\nphilosophy until now, often playing key roles in all sorts of disputes\nand arguments, especially in metaphysics. Here we shall briefly review\nsome of these distinctions and others will surface in the following\nsections. More details can be found in other more specialized entries,\nto which we shall refer. \nLocke influentially distinguished between primary and\nsecondary qualities; the former are objective features of\nthings, such as shapes, sizes and weights, whereas the latter are\nmind-dependent, e.g., colors, tastes,\nsounds, and smells. This contrast was already\nemphasized by the Greek atomists and was revived in modern times by\nGalileo, Descartes, and Boyle. \nAt least since Aristotle, the essential properties of an\nobject have been contrasted with its accidental properties;\nthe object could not exist without the former, whereas it could fail\nto have the latter (see entry on\n essential vs. accidental properties).\n Among essential properties, some acknowledge individual\nessences (also called “haecceities” or\n“thisnesses”), which univocally characterize a certain\nindividual. Adams (1979) conceives of such properties as involving,\nvia the identity relation, the very individual in question, e.g.,\nSocrates: being identical to Socrates, which cannot exist if\nSocrates does not exist. In contrast, Plantinga (1974) views them as\ncapable of existing without the individuals of which they are\nessences, e.g., Socratizing, which could have existed even if\nSocrates had not existed. See\n §5.2\n on the issue of the essences of properties themselves. \n Sortal properties are typically\nexpressed by count nouns like “desk” and “cat”\nand are taken to encode principles of individuation and persistence\nthat allow us to objectively count objects. For example, there is a\nfact of the matter regarding how many things in this room instantiate\nbeing a desk and being a cat. On the other hand,\nnon-sortal properties such as red or water do not\nallow us to count in a similarly obvious way. This distinction is\noften appealed to in contemporary metaphysics (P. Strawson 1959: ch.\n5, §2; Armstrong 1978a: ch. 11, §4), where, in contrast, the\ntraditional one between genus and\n species\n plays a relatively small role. The latter figured conspicuously in\nAristotle and in much subsequent philosophy inspired by him. We can\nview a genus as a property more general than a corresponding species\nproperty, in a hierarchically relative manner. For example, being\na mammal is a genus relative to the species being a\nhuman, but it is a species relative to the genus being an\nanimal. The possession of a property called differentia\nis appealed to in order to distinguish between different species\nfalling under a common genus; e.g., as the tradition has it, the\ndifferentia for being human is being rational (Aristotle,\nCategories, 3a). Similar hierarchies of properties, however\nwithout anything like differentiae, come with the distinction of\n determinables and determinates,\n which appears to be\nmore prominent in current metaphysics. Color properties provide\ntypical examples of such hierarchies, e.g., with red and\nscarlet as determinable and determinate, respectively. \nWe saw right at the outset that objects exemplify, or instantiate,\nproperties. More generally, items of all sorts, including properties\nthemselves, exemplify properties, or, in different terminology,\nbear, have or possess properties. Reversing\norder, we can also say that properties characterize, or\ninhere in, the items that exemplify them. There is then a\nvery general phenomenon of exemplification to investigate, which has\nbeen labeled in various ways, as the variety of terms of art just\ndisplayed testifies. All such terms have often been given special\ntechnical senses in the rich array of different explorations of this\nterritory since Ancient and Medieval times up to the present age (see,\ne.g., Lowe 2006: 77). These explorations can hardly be disentangled\nfrom the task of providing a general ontological picture with its own\ncategorial distinctions. In line with what most philosophers do\nnowadays, we choose “exemplification”, or, equivalently,\n“instantiation” (and their cognates), to discuss this\nphenomenon in general and to approach some different accounts that\nhave been given of it in recent times. This sweeping use of these\nterms is to be kept distinct from the more specialized uses of them\nthat will surface below (and to some extent have already surfaced\nabove) in describing specific approaches by different philosophers\nwith their own terminologies. \nWe have taken for granted that there is just one kind of\nexemplification, applying indifferently to different categories of\nentities. This monist option may indeed be considered the\ndefault one. A typical recent case of a philosopher who endorses it is\nArmstrong (1997). He distinguishes three basic\ncategories, particulars, properties or relations, and states of\naffairs, and takes exemplification as cutting across them: properties\nand relations are exemplified not only by particulars, but by\nproperties or relations and states of affairs as well. But some\nphilosophers are pluralist: they distinguish different kinds\nof exemplification, in relation to categorial distinctions in their\nontology. \nOne may perhaps attribute different kinds of exemplification to the\nabove-considered Meinongians in view of the different sorts of\npredication that they admit (see, e.g., Monaghan’s (2011)\ndiscussion of Zalta’s theory). A more typical example of the\npluralist alternative is however provided by Lowe (2006), who\ndistinguishes “instantiation”,\n“characterization” and “exemplification” in\nhis account of four fundamental categories: objects, and three\ndifferent sorts of properties, namely kinds (substantial universals),\nattributes and modes\n (tropes).[7]\n To illustrate, Fido is a dog insofar as it instantiates the\nkind dog, \\(D\\), which in turn is characterized by\nthe attribute of barking, \\(B\\). Hence, when Fido is barking, it\nexemplifies \\(B\\) occurrently by virtue of being\ncharacterized by a barking mode, \\(b\\), that instantiates \\(B\\); and,\nwhen Fido is silent, it exemplifies \\(B\\) dispositionally,\nsince \\(D\\), which Fido instantiates, is characterized by\n\\(B\\) (see Gorman 2014 for a critical discussion of this sort of\nview). \nMost philosophers, whether tacitly or overtly, appear to take\nexemplification as primitive and unanalyzable. However, on certain\nviews of particulars, it might seem that exemplification is reduced to\nsomething more fundamental. \nA well-known such approach is the bundle theory, which takes\nparticulars to be nothing more than “bundles” of\nuniversals connected by a special relation, commonly called\ncompresence, after Russell (1948: Pt. IV, ch.\n 8)[8].\n Despite well-known problems (Van Cleve 1985), this view, or\napproaches in its vicinity, keep having supporters (Casullo 1988;\nCurtis 2014; Dasgupta 2009; Paul 2002; Shiver 2014; J. Russell 2018;\nsee Sider 2020, ch. 3, for a recent critical analysis). From this\nperspective, that a particular exemplifies a property amounts to the\nproperty’s being compresent with the properties that constitute\nthe bundle with which the particular in question is identified. It\nthus looks as if exemplification is reduced to compresence.\nNevertheless, compresence itself is presumably jointly exemplified by\nthe properties that constitute a given bundle, and thus at most there\nis a reduction, to compresence, of exemplification by a\nparticular (understood as a bundle), and not an elimination of\nexemplification in general. \nAnother, more recent, approach is based on partial identity.\nBaxter (2001) and, inspired by him, Armstrong (2004), have proposed\nrelated assays of exemplification, which seem to analyze it in terms\nof such partial identity. These views have captured some interest and\ntriggered discussions (see, e.g., Mumford 2007; Baxter’s (2013)\nreply to critics and Baxter’s (2018) rejoinder to Brown\n2017). \nBaxter (2001) relies on the notion of aspect and on the\nrelativization of numerical identity to counts. In his view,\nboth particulars and properties have aspects, which can be\nsimilar to distinct aspects of other particulars or properties. The\nnumerical identity of aspects is relative to standards for counting,\ncounts, which group items in count collections: aspects of\nparticulars in the particular collection, and aspects of\nuniversals, in the universal collection. There can then be a\ncross-count identity, which holds between an aspect in the\nparticular collection, and an aspect in the universal collection,\ne.g., the aspects Hume as human and humanity as had by\nHume. In this case, the universal and the particular in question\n(humanity and Hume, in our example) are partially identical.\nInstantiation, e.g., that Hume instantiates humanity, then amounts to\nthis partial identity of a universal and a particular. One may have\nthe feeling, as Baxter himself worries (2001: 449), that in this\napproach instantiation has been traded for something definitely more\nobscure, such as aspects and an idiosyncratic view of identity. It can\nalso be suspected that particulars’ and properties’\nhaving aspects is presupposed in this analysis, where this\nhaving is a relation rather close to exemplification\nitself. \nArmstrong (2004) tries to do without aspects. At first glance it seems\nas if he analyzes exemplification, for he takes the exemplification of\na property (a universal) by a particular to be a partial identity of\nthe property and the particular; as he puts it (2004: 47), “[i]t\nis not a mere mereological overlap, as when two streets intersect, but\nit is a partial identity”. However, when we see more closely\nwhat this partial identity amounts to, the suspicion arises that it\npresupposes exemplification. For Armstrong appears to identify a\nparticular via the properties that it instantiates and\nsimilarly a property via the particulars that instantiate it.\nSo that we may identify a particular, \\(x\\), via a collection of\nproperties qua instantiated by \\(x\\), say \\(\\{F_x,\\) \\(G_x,\\)\n\\(H_x,\\) …, \\(P_x,\\) \\(Q_x,\\) \\(\\ldots\\};\\) and a property,\n\\(P\\), via a collection of particulars qua instantiating\n\\(P\\), say \\(\\{P_a, P_b , \\ldots ,P_x, P_y , \\ldots \\}\\). By putting\nthings in this way, we can then say that a particular is partially\nidentical to a property when the collection that identifies the\nparticular has an element in common with the collection that\nidentifies the property. To illustrate, the \\(x\\) and the \\(P\\) of our\nexample are partially identical because they have the element \\(P_x\\)\nin common. Now, the elements of these collections are neither\nproperties tout court nor particulars tout court,\nwhich led us to talk of properties qua instantiated and\nparticulars qua\n instantiating.[9]\n But this of course presupposes instantiation. Moreover, there is the\nunwelcome consequence that the world becomes dramatically less\ncontingent than we would have thought at first sight, for neither a\nconcrete particular nor a property can exist without it being the case\nthat the former has the properties it happens to have, and that the\nlatter is instantiated by the same particulars that actually\ninstantiate it; we get, as Mumford puts it (2007: 185), “a major\nnew kind of necessity in the world”. \nOne important motivation, possibly the main one, behind attempts at\nanalysis such as the ones we have just seen is the worry to avoid the\nso-called Bradley’s regress\nregarding\nexemplification (Baxter 2001: 449; Mumford 2007: 185), which goes as\nfollows. Suppose that the individual \\(a\\) has the property \\(F\\). For\n\\(a\\) to instantiate \\(F\\) it must be linked to \\(F\\) by a\n(dyadic) relation of instantiation, \\(I_1\\). But this requires a\nfurther (triadic) relation of instantiation, \\(I_2\\), that connects\n\\(I_1, F\\) and \\(a\\), and so on without end. At each stage a further\nconnecting relation is required, and thus it seems that nothing\never gets connected to anything else (it is not clear to what\nextent Bradley had this version in mind; for references to analogous\nregresses prior to Bradley’s, see Gaskin 2008: ch. 5,\n§70). \nThis regress has traditionally been regarded as vicious (see, e.g.,\nBergmann 1960), although philosophers such as Russell (1903: §55)\nand Armstrong (1997: 18–19) have argued that it is not. In doing\nso, however, they seem to take for granted the fact that \\(a\\) has the\nproperty \\(F\\) (pretty much as in the brute fact approach;\nsee below) and go on to see \\(a\\)’s and \\(F\\)’s\ninstantiating \\(I_1\\) as a further fact that is merely\nentailed by the former, which in turn entails \\(a\\)’s,\n\\(F\\)’s and \\(I_1\\)’s instantiating \\(I_2\\), and so on.\nThis way of looking at the matter tends to be regarded as a standard\nresponse to the regress. But those who see the regress as vicious\nassume that the various exemplification relations are introduced in an\neffort to explain the very existence of the fact that \\(a\\)\nhas the property \\(F\\). Hence, from their explanatory standpoint,\ntaking the fact in question as an unquestioned ground for a chain of\nentailments is beside the point (cf. Loux 1998: 31–36;\nVallicella 2002). \nIt should be noted, however, that this perspective suggests a\ndistinction between an “internalist” and an\n“externalist” version of the regress (in the terminology\nof Orilia 2006a). In the former, at each stage we postulate a new\nconstituent of the fact, or state of affairs, \\(s\\), that exists\ninsofar as \\(a\\) has the property \\(F\\), and there is viciousness\nbecause \\(s\\) can never be appropriately\n characterized.[10]\n In the latter, at each stage we postulate a new, distinct, state of\naffairs, whose existence is required by the existence of the state of\naffairs of the previous stage. This amounts to admitting infinite\nexplanatory and metaphysical dependence chains. However, according to\nOrilia (2006b: §7), since no decisive arguments against such\nchains exist, the externalist regress should not be viewed as vicious\n(for criticisms, see Maurin 2015 and Allen 2016: §2.4.1; for a\nsimilar view about predication, see Gaskin 2008). \nA typical line for those convinced that the regress is vicious has\nconsisted in proposing that instantiation is not a relation, or at\nleast not a normal one. Some philosophers hold that it is a sui\ngeneris linkage that hooks things up without intermediaries.\nPeter Strawson (1959) calls it a non-relational tie and\nBergmann (1960) calls it a nexus. Broad (1933: 85) likened\ninstantiation to glue, which just sticks two sheets of paper\ntogether, without needing anything additional; similarly,\ninstantiation just relates. An alternative line has been to\nreject instantiation altogether. According to Frege, it is not needed,\nbecause properties have “gaps” that can be filled, and\naccording to a reading of Wittgenstein’s Tractatus,\nbecause objects and properties can be connected like links in a chain.\nHowever, both strategies are problematic, as argued by Vallicella\n(2002). His basic point is that, if \\(a\\) has property \\(F\\), we need\nan ontological explanation of why \\(F\\) and \\(a\\) happen to be\nconnected in such a way that \\(a\\) has \\(F\\) as one of its properties\n(unless \\(F\\) is a property that \\(a\\) has necessarily). But none of\nthese strategies can provide this explanation. For example, the appeal\nto gaps is pointless: \\(F\\) has a gap whether or not it is filled by\n\\(a\\) (for example, it could be filled in by another object), and thus\nthe gap cannot explain the fact that \\(a\\) has \\(F\\) as one of its\nproperties. \nBefore turning to exemplification as partial identity, Armstrong\n(1997: 118) has claimed that Bradley’s regress can be avoided by\ntaking a state of affairs, say \\(x\\)’s being \\(P\\), as capable\nby itself of holding together its constituents, i.e., the object \\(x\\)\nand the property \\(P\\) (see also Perovic 2016). Thus, there is no need\nto invoke a relation of exemplification linking \\(x\\) and \\(P\\) in\norder to explain how \\(x\\) and \\(P\\) succeed in giving rise to a\nunitary item, namely the state of affairs in question. There seems to\nbe a circularity here for it appears that we want to explain how an\nobject and a property come to be united in a state of affairs by\nappealing to the result of this unification, namely the state of\naffairs itself. But perhaps this view can be interpreted as simply the\nidea that states of affairs should be taken for granted in a\nprimitivist fashion without seeking an explanation of their unity by\nappealing to exemplification or otherwise; this is the brute fact\napproach, as we may call it (for supporters, see Van Inwagen\n(1993: 37) and Oliver (1996: 33); for criticisms and a possible\ndefense, see Vallicella 2002, and Orilia 2016, respectively). \nLowe (2006) has tried to tackle Bradley’s regress within his\npluralist approach to exemplification. In his view, characterization,\ninstantiation and exemplification are “formal” and thus\nquite different from garden-variety relations such giving or\nloving. This guarantees that these three relations escape\nBradley’s regress (Lowe 2006: 30, 80,\n 90).[11]\n Let us illustrate how, by turning back to the Fido example of\n §2.1.\n What a mode instantiates and what it characterizes belong to its\nessence. In other words, a mode cannot exist without instantiating the\nattribute it instantiates and characterizing the object it\ncharacterizes. Hence, mode \\(b\\), by simply existing, instantiates\nattribute \\(B\\) and characterizes Fido. Moreover, since\nexemplification (the occurrent one, in this case) results from\n“composing” characterization and instantiation,\n\\(b\\)’s existence also guarantees that Fido exemplifies \\(B\\).\nAccording to Lowe, we thus have some truths, that \\(b\\) characterizes\nFido, that \\(b\\) instantiates \\(B\\), and that Fido exemplifies \\(B\\)\n(i.e., is barking), all of which are made true by \\(b\\). Hence, there\nis no need to postulate as truthmakers states of affairs with\nconstituents, Fido and \\(b\\), related by characterization, or \\(b\\)\nand \\(B\\), related by exemplification, or Fido and \\(B\\), related by\nexemplification. This, in Lowe’s opinion, eschews\nBradley’s regress, since this arises precisely because we appeal\nto states of affairs with constituents in need of a glue that\ncontingently keep them together. Nevertheless, there is no loss of\ncontingency in Lowe’s world picture, for an object need not be\ncharacterized by the modes that happen to characterize it. Thus, for\nexample, mode \\(b\\) might have failed to exist and there could have\nbeen a Fido silence mode in its stead, in which case the proposition\nthat Fido is barking would have been false and the proposition that\nFido is silent would have been true. One may wonder however what makes\nit the case that a certain mode is a mode of just a certain object and\nnot of another one, say another barking dog. Even granting that it is\nessential for \\(b\\) to be a mode of Fido, rather than of another dog,\nit remains true that it is of Fido, rather than of the other\ndog, and one may still think that this being of is also glue\nof some sort, perhaps with a contingency inherited from the\ncontingency of \\(b\\) (which might have failed to exist). The suspicion\nthen is that the problem of accounting for the relation between a mode\nand an object has replaced the Armstrongian one of what makes it the\ncase that a universal \\(P\\) and an object \\(x\\) make up the state of\naffairs \\(x\\)’s being \\(P\\). But the former problem,\none may urge, is no less thorny than the latter, and some\nuniversalists like Armstrong may consider uneconomical Lowe’s\nacceptance of tropes in addition to universals (for accounts of\nBradley’s regress analogous to Lowe’s, but within a\nthoroughly tropist ontology, see Section 3.2 of the entry on\n tropes.) \nAs it should be clear from this far from exhaustive survey,\nBradley’s regress deeply worries ontologists and the attempts to\ntame it keep\n flowing.[12] \nPresumably, properties exemplify properties. For example, if\nproperties are abstract objects, as is usually thought, then seemingly\nevery property exemplifies abstractness. But then we should also grant\nthat there is self-exemplification, i.e., a property exemplifying\nitself. For example, abstractness is itself abstract and thus\nexemplifies itself. Self-exemplification however has raised severe\nperplexities at least since Plato. \nPlato appears to hold that all properties exemplify\nthemselves, when he claims that forms participate in themselves. This\nclaim is crucially involved in his so-called third man\nargument, which led him to worry that his theory of forms is\nincoherent (Parmenides, 132 ff.). As we see matters now, it\nis not clear why we should hold that all properties exemplify\nthemselves (Armstrong 1978a: 71); for instance, people are honest, but\nhonesty itself is not honest (see, however, the entry on\n Plato’s Parmenides,\n and Marmodoro forthcoming). \nNowadays, a more serious worry related to self-exemplification is\nRussell’s famous paradox, constructed as regarding the property\nof non-self-exemplification, which appears to exemplify itself iff it\ndoes not, thus defying the laws of logic, at least classical logic.\nThe discovery of his paradox (and then the awareness of related\npuzzles) led Russell to introduce a theory of types, which institutes\na total ban on self-predication by a rigid segregation of properties\ninto a hierarchy of types (more on this in\n §6.1).\n The account became more complex and rigid, as Russell moved from\nsimple to ramified type theory, which involves a\ndistinction of orders within types (see entries on\n type theory\n and\n Russell’s paradox,\n and, for a detailed reconstruction of how Russell reacted to the\nparadox, Landini 1998). \nIn type theory all properties are, we may say, typed. This\napproach has never gained unanimous consensus and its many problematic\naspects are well-known (see, e.g., Fitch 1952: Appendix C; Bealer\n1989). Just to mention a few, the type-theoretical hierarchy imposed\non properties appears to be highly artificial and multiplies\nproperties ad infinitum (e.g., since presumably properties\nare abstract, for any property \\(P\\) of type \\(n\\), there is an\nabstractness of type \\(n+1\\) that \\(P\\) exemplifies). Moreover, many\ncases of self-exemplification are innocuous and common. For example,\nthe property of being a property is itself a property, so it\nexemplifies itself. Accordingly, many recent proposals are type-free\n(see\n §6.1)\n and thus view properties as untyped, capable of being\nself-predicated, sometimes veridically. An additional motivation to\nmove in this direction is a new paradox proposed by Orilia and Landini\n(2019), which affects simple type theory. It is\n“contingent” in that it is derived from a contingent\nassumption, namely that someone, say John, is thinking just about the\nproperty of being a property \\(P\\) such that John is thinking of\nsomething that is not exemplified by \\(P\\). \nQuine (1957 [1969: 23]) famously claimed that there should be no\nentity without identity. His paradigmatic case concerns sets: two of\nthem are identical iff they have exactly the same members. Since then\nit has been customary in ontology to search for identity conditions\nfor given categories of entities and to rule out categories for want\nof identity conditions (against this, see Lowe 1989). Quine started\nthis trend precisely by arguing against properties and this has\nstrictly intertwined the issues of which properties there are and of\ntheir identity\n conditions.[13] \nIn an effort to provide identity conditions for properties, one could\nmimic those for sets, or equate the former with the latter (as in\nclass nominalism; see note 3), and provide the following\nextensionalist identity conditions: two properties are\nidentical iff they are co-extensional. This criterion can hardly work,\nhowever, since there are seemingly distinct properties with the same\nextension, such as having a heart and having\nkidneys, and even wildly different properties such as\nspherical and weighing 2 kilos could by accident be\nco-extensive. \nOne could then try the following intensional identity\nconditions: two properties are identical iff they are\nco-intensional, i.e., necessarily co-extensional, where the\nnecessity in question is logical necessity. This guarantees that\nspherical and weighing 2 kilos are different even if\nthey happen to be co-extensional. Following this line, one may take\nproperties to be intensions, understood as, roughly,\nfunctions that assign extensions (sets of objects) to predicates at\nlogically possible worlds. Thus, for instance, the predicates\n“has a heart” and “has kidneys” stand for\ndifferent intensions, for even if they have the same extension in the\nactual world they have different extensions at worlds where there are\ncreatures with heart and no kidneys or vice versa. This approach is\nfollowed by Montague (1974) in his pioneering work in natural language\nsemantics, and in a similar way by Lewis (1986b), who reduces\nproperties to sets of possible objects in his modal realism,\nexplicitly committed to possible worlds and mere possibilia\ninhabiting them. Most philosophers find this commitment unappealing.\nMoreover, one may wonder how properties can do their causal work if\nthey are conceived of in this way (for further criticisms see Bealer\n1982: 13–19, and 1998: §4; Egan 2004). However, the\ncriterion of co-intensionality may be accepted without also buying the\nreduction of properties to sets of possibilia (Bealer views\nthis as the identity condition for his conception 1 properties; see\nbelow). Still, co-intensionality must face two challenges coming from\nopposite fronts. \nOn the one hand, from the perspective of empirical science,\nco-intensionality may appear too strong as a criterion of identity.\nFor the identity statements of scientific reductions, such as that of\ntemperature to mean kinetic energy, could suggest that some properties\nare identical even if not co-intensional. For example, one may accept\nthat having absolute temperature of 300K is having mean\nmolecular kinetic energy of \\(6.21 \\times 10^{-21}\\) (Achinstein\n1974: 259; Putnam (1970: §1) and Causey (1972) speak of\n“synthetic identity” and “contingent\nidentity”, respectively). Rather than logical necessity, it is\nnomological necessity, necessity on the basis of the causal\nlaws of nature, that becomes central in this line of thought.\nFollowing it, some have focused on the causal and\nnomological roles of properties, i.e., roughly, the causes\nand effects of their being instantiated, and their involvement in laws\nof nature, respectively. They have thus advanced causal or\nnomic criteria. According to them, two properties are identical\niff they have the same causal (Achinstein 1974: §XI; Shoemaker\n1980) or nomological role (Swoyer 1982; Kistler 2002). This line has\nbeen influential, as it connects to the “pure\ndispositionalism” discussed in\n §5.2.\n There is however a suspicion of circularity here, since causal and\nnomological roles may be viewed as higher-order properties (see entry\non\n dispositions, §3). \nOn the other hand, once matters of meaning and mental content are\ntaken into account, co-intensionality might seem too weak, for it\nmakes a property \\(P\\) identical to any logically equivalent property,\ne.g., assuming classical logic, \\(P\\) and (\\(Q\\) or not\n\\(Q\\)). And with a sufficiently broad notion of logical\nnecessity, even, for example, being triangular and being\ntrilateral are identical. However, one could insist that\n“trilateral” and “triangular” appear to have\ndifferent meanings, which somehow involve the different geometrical\nproperties having a side, and having an angle,\nrespectively. And if being triangular were really identical\nto being trilateral, from the fact that John believes that a\ncertain object has the former property, one should be able to infer\nthat John also believes that such an object has the latter property.\nYet, John’s ignorance may make this conclusion unwarranted. In\nthe light of this, borrowing a term from Cresswell (1975), one may\nmove from intensional to hyperintensional identity\nconditions, according to which two properties, such as trilaterality\nand triangularity, may be different even if they are co-intensional.\nIn order to implement this idea, Bealer (1982) take two properties to\nbe identical iff they have the same analysis, i.e., roughly, they\nresult from the same ultimate primitive properties and the same\nlogical operations applied to them (see also Menzel 1986; 1993). Zalta\n(1983; 1988) has developed an alternative available to those who admit\ntwo modes of predication (see\n §1.4):\n two properties are identical iff they are (necessarily) encoded by\nthe same objects. \nHyperintensional conditions make of course for finer distinctions\namong entities than the other criteria we considered. Accordingly, the\nformer are often called “fine-grained” and the latter\n“coarse-grained”, and the same denominations are\ncorrespondingly reserved for the entities that obey the conditions in\nquestion. Coarse- or fine-grainedness is a relative matter. The\nextensional criterion is more coarse-grained than the intensional or\ncausal/nomological ones. And hyperintensional conditions themselves\nmay be more or less fine-grained: properties could be individuated\nalmost as finely as the predicates expressing them, to the point that,\ne.g., even being \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) and being \\(Q\\) and\n\\(P\\) are kept distinct, but one may also envisage less stringent\nconditions that make for the identification of properties of that sort\n(Bealer 1982: 54). It is conceivable, however, that one could be\nlogically obtuse to the point of believing that something has a\ncertain property without believing that it has a trivially equivalent\nproperty. Thus, to properly account for mental content,\nmaximal hyperintensionality appears to be required, and it is\nin fact preferred by Bealer. Even so, the paradox of analysis\nraises a serious issue.\nOne could say, for example, that being a circle is being\na locus of points equidistant from a point, since the latter\nprovides the analysis of the former. In reply, Bealer distinguishes\nbetween “being a circle” as designating a simple\n“undefined” property, which is an analysandum\ndistinct from the analysans, being a locus of points\nequidistant from a point, and “being a circle” as\ndesignating a complex “defined” property, which is indeed\nidentical to that analysans. Orilia (1999: §5.5)\nsimilarly distinguishes between the simple analysans and the\ncomplex analysandum, without admitting that expressions for\nproperties such as “being a circle” could be ambiguous in\nthe way Bealer suggests. Orilia rather argues that the\n“is” of analysis does not express identity but a weaker\nrelation, which is asymmetrical in that analysans and\nanalysandum play different roles in it. The matter keeps\nbeing discussed. Rosen (2015) appeals to grounding to characterize the\ndifferent role played by the analysans. Dorr (2016) provides\na formal account of the “is” used in identity statements\ninvolving properties, according to which it stands for a symmetric\n“identification” relation. \nBealer (1982) distinguishes between conception 1 properties,\nor qualities, and conception 2 properties, or\nconcepts (understood as mind-independent). With a different\nand now widespread terminology, Lewis (1983, 1986b) followed suit,\nspeaking of a sparse and an abundant conception of\nproperties. According to the former, there are relatively few\nproperties, namely just those responsible for the objective\nresemblances and causal powers of things; they cut nature at its\njoints, and science is supposed to individuate them a\nposteriori. According to the latter, there are immensely many\nproperties, corresponding to all meaningful predicates we could\npossibly imagine and to all sets of objects, and they can be assumed\na priori. (It should be clear that “few” and\n“many” are used in a comparative sense, for the number of\nsparse properties may be very high, possibly infinite). To illustrate,\nthe sparse conception admits properties currently accepted by\nempirical science such as having negative charge or\nhaving spin up and rejects those that are no longer supported\nsuch as having a certain amount of caloric, which featured in\neighteenth century chemistry; in contrast, the abundant conception may\nacknowledge the latter property and all sorts of other properties,\nstrange as they may be, e.g., negatively charged or disliked by\nSocrates, round and square or Goodman’s (1983)\nnotorious grue and bleen. Lewis (1986b: 60) tries to\nfurther characterize the distinction by taking the sparse properties\nto be intrinsic, rather than extrinsic (e.g.,\nbeing 6 feet tall, rather than being taller than\nTom), and natural, where naturalness is something that\nadmits of degrees (for example, he says, masses and charges are\nperfectly natural, colors are less natural and grue and\nbleen are paradigms of unnaturalness). Much work on such\nissues has been done since then (see entries on\n intrinsic vs. extrinsic properties\n and\n natural properties). \nDepending on how sparse or abundant properties are, we can have two\nextreme positions and other more moderate views in between. \nAt one end of the spectrum, there is the most extreme version of the\nsparse conception, minimalism, which accepts all of these\nprinciples: \nThis approach is typically motivated by physicalism and\nepistemological qualms regarding transcendent universals. The\nbest-known contemporary supporter of minimalism is Armstrong (1978a,b,\n1984). Another minimalist is Swoyer (1996). \nBy dropping or mitigating some of the above principles, we get less\nminimalist versions of the sparse conception. For example, some have\nurged uninstantiated properties to account for features of measurement\n(Mundy 1987), vectors (Bigelow & Pargetter 1991: 77), or natural\nlaws (Tooley 1987), and some even that there are all the properties\nthat can be possibly exemplified, where the possibility in question is\ncausal or nomic (Cocchiarella 2007: ch. 12). In line with\npositions traditionally found in emergentism (see\n §5.1),\n Schaffer (2004) proposes that there are sparse properties as\nfundamental, and in addition, as grounded on them, the properties that\nneed be postulated at all levels of scientific explanations, e.g.,\nchemical, biological and psychological ones. Even Armstrong goes\nbeyond minimalist strictures, when in his later work (1997)\ndistinguishes between “first-class properties”\n(universals), identified from a minimalist perspective, and\n“second-class properties” (supervening on universals). All\nthese positions appear to be primarily concerned with issues in the\nmetaphysics of science (see\n §5)\n and typically display too short a supply of properties to deal with\nmeaning and mental content, and thus with natural language semantics\nand the foundations of mathematics (see\n §6).\n However, minimalists might want to resort to concepts, understood as\nmind-dependent entities, in dealing with such issues (e.g., along the\nlines proposed in Cocchiarella 2007). \nMatters of meaning and mental content are instead what typically\nmotivate the views at the opposite end of the spectrum. To begin with,\nmaximalism, i.e., the abundant conception in all its glory\n(Bealer 1982; 1993; Carmichael 2010; Castañeda 1976; Jubien\n1989; Lewis 1986b; Orilia 1999; Zalta 1988; Van Inwagen 2004):\nproperties are fine-grained necessary entities that exist even if\nuninstantiated, or even impossible to be instantiated. In its most\nextreme version, maximalism adopts identity conditions that\ndifferentiate properties as much as possible, but more moderate\nversions can be obtained by slightly relaxing such conditions. Views\nof this sort are hardly concerned with physicalist constraints or the\nlike and rather focus on the explanatory advantages of\nhyperintensionality. These may well go beyond the typical motivations\nconsidered above: Nolan (2014) argues that hyperintensionality is\nincreasingly important in metaphysics in dealing with issues such as\ncounter-possible conditionals, explanation, essences, grounding,\ncausation, confirmation and chance. \nRather than choosing between the sparse and abundant conceptions, the\nvery promoters of this distinction have opted in different ways for a\ndualism of properties, according to which there are\nproperties of both kinds. Lewis endorses abundant properties as\nreduced to sets of possibilia, and sparse properties either\nviewed as universals, and corresponding to some of the abundant\nproperties (1983), or as themselves sets of possibilia (1986b: 60).\nBealer (1982) proposes a systematic account wherein qualities are the\ncoarse-grained properties that “provide the world with its\ncausal and phenomenal order” (1982: 183) and concepts are the\nfine-grained properties that can function as meanings and as\nconstituents of mental contents. He admits a stock of simple\nproperties, which are both qualities and concepts (1982: 186),\nwherefrom complex qualities and complex concepts are differently\nconstructed: on the one hand, by thought-building operations,\nwhich give rise to fine-grained qualities; on the other hand, by\ncondition-building operations, which give rise to\ncoarse-grained qualities. Orilia (1999) has followed Bealer’s\nlead in also endorsing both coarse-grained qualities and fine-grained\nconcepts, without however identifying simple concepts and simple\nqualities. In Orilia’s account concepts are never identical to\nqualities, but may correspond to them; in particular, the identity\nstatements of intertheoretic reductions should be taken to express the\nfact that two different concepts correspond to the same quality.\nDespite its advantages in dealing with a disparate range of phenomena,\ndualism has not gained any explicit consensus. Its implicit presence\nmay however be widespread. For example, Putnam’s (1970: §1)\ndistinction between predicates and physical\nproperties, and Armstrong’s above-mentioned recognition of\nsecond-class properties may be seen as forms of dualism. \nIt is customary to distinguish between simple and\ncomplex properties, even though some philosophers take all\nproperties to be simple (Grossmann 1983: §§58–61). The\nformer are not characterizable in terms of other properties, are\nprimitive and unanalyzable and thus have no internal structure,\nwhereas the latter somehow have a structure, wherein other properties,\nor more generally entities, are parts or constituents. It is not\nobvious that there are simple properties, since one may imagine that\nall properties are analyzable into constituents ad infinitum\n(Armstrong 1978b: 67). Even setting this aside, to provide examples is\nnot easy. Traditionally, determinate colors are cited, but nowadays\nmany would rather appeal to fundamental physical properties such as\nhaving a certain electric charge. It is easier to provide\nputative examples of complex properties, once some other properties\nare taken for granted, e.g., blue and spherical or blue\nor non-spherical. These logically compound properties,\nwhich involve logical operations, will be considered in\n §4.1.\n Next, in\n §4.2\n we shall discuss other kinds of complex properties, called\nstructural (after Armstrong 1978b), which are eliciting a\ngrowing interest, as a recent survey testifies (Fisher 2018). Their\ncomplexity has to do with the subdivisions of their instances into\nsubcomponents. Typical examples come from chemistry, e.g.,\nH2O and methane understood as properties\nof molecules. \nIt should be noted that it is not generally taken for granted that\ncomplex properties literally have parts or constituents. Some\nphilosophers take this line (Armstrong 1978a: 36–39, 67ff.;\nBigelow & Pargetter 1989; Orilia 1999), whereas others demur, and\nrather think that talk in terms of structures with constituents is\nmetaphorical and dependent on our reliance on structured terms such as\n“blue and spherical” (Bealer 1982; Cocchiarella 1986a;\nSwoyer 1998: §1.2). \nAt least prima facie, our use of complex predicates suggests\nthat there are corresponding complex properties involving all sorts of\nlogical operations. Thus, one can envisage conjunctive\nproperties such as blue and spherical, negative properties\nsuch as non-spherical, disjunctive properties such\nas blue or non-spherical, existentially or\nuniversally quantified properties such as loving\nsomeone or loved by everyone, reflexive\nproperties such as loving oneself, etc. Moreover, one could\nadd to the list properties with individuals as constituents, which are\nthen denied the status of a purely qualitative property,\ne.g., taller than Obama. \nIt is easy to construct complex predicates. But whether there really\nare corresponding properties of this kind is a much more difficult and\ncontroversial issue, tightly bound to the sparse/abundant distinction.\nIn the sparse conception the tendency is to dispense with them. This\nis understandable since in this camp one typically postulates\nproperties in rebus for empirical explanatory reasons. But\nthen, if we explain some phenomena by attributing properties \\(F\\) and\n\\(G\\) to an object, while denying that it does not exemplify \\(H\\), it\nseems of no value to add that it also has, say, F and G,\nF or H, and non-H. Nevertheless, Armstrong, the\nleading supporter of sparseness, has defended over the years a mixed\nstance without disjunctive and negative properties, but with\nconjunctive ones. Armstrong’s line has of course its opponents\n(see, e.g., Paolini Paoletti 2014; 2017a; 2020a; Zangwill 2011 argues\nthat there are negative properties, but they are less real than\npositive ones). On the other hand, in the abundant conception, all\nsorts of logically compound properties are acknowledged. Since the\nfocus now is on meaning and mental content, it appears natural to\npostulate such properties to account for our understanding of complex\npredicates and of how they differ from simple ones. Even here,\nhowever, there are disagreements, when it comes to problematic\npredicates such the “does not exemplify itself” of\nRussell’s paradox. Some suggest that in this case one should\ndeny there is a corresponding property, in order to avoid the paradox\n(Van Inwagen 2006). However, we understand this predicate and thus it\nseems ad hoc that the general strategy of postulating a\nproperty fails. It seems better to confront the paradox with other\nmeans (see\n §6). \nFollowing Armstrong (1978b: 68–71; see also Fisher 2018:\n§2), a structural property \\(F\\) is typically viewed as a\nuniversal, and can be characterized thus: \nFor instance, a molecule \\(w\\) exemplifying H2O\nhas as parts two atoms \\(h_1\\) and \\(h_2\\) and an atom \\(o\\) that do\nnot exemplify H2O; this property involves\nhydrogen and oxygen, which are not exemplified by\n\\(w\\); \\(h_1\\) and \\(h_2\\) exemplify hydrogen, and \\(o\\)\nexemplifies oxygen. For relational structural\nproperties, there is the further condition that \nH2O is a case in point: the relevant (chemical)\nrelation is bonding, which links the three atoms in question.\nAnother, often considered, example is methane as a structural\nproperty of methane-molecules (CH4), which\ninvolves a bonding relation between atoms and the joint\ninstantiation of hydrogen (by four atoms) and carbon\n(by one atom). Non-relational structural properties do not\nrequire condition (iv). For instance, mass 1 kg involves many\nrelevant properties of the kind mass n kg, for \\(n \\lt 1\\),\nwhich are instantiated by relevant proper parts of any object that is\n1 kg in mass, and these proper parts are not linked by any relevant\nrelation (Armstrong 1978b: 70). \nIn most approaches, including Armstrong’s, the relevant\nproperties and the relevant relation, if any, are conceived of as\nparts, or constituents, of the structural property in question, and\nthus their being involved in the latter is a parthood relation. For\ninstance, hydrogen, oxygen and bonding are\nconstituents of H2O. Moreover, the composition of\nstructural properties is isomorphic to that of the complexes\nexemplifying them. These two theses characterize what Lewis (1986a)\ncalls the “pictorial conception”. It is worth noting that\nstructural properties differ from conjunctive properties such as\nhuman and musician, in that the constituents of the latter\n(i.e., human and musician) are instantiated by\nwhatever entity exemplifies the conjunctive property (i.e., a human\nbeing who is also a musician), whereas the constituents of a\nstructural property (e.g., hydrogen, oxygen and\nbonding) are not instantiated by the entities that\ninstantiate it (e.g., H2O molecules). \nStructural properties have been invoked for many reasons. Armstrong\n(1978b: ch. 22) appeals to them to explain the resemblance of\nuniversals belonging to a common class, e.g., lengths and colors.\nArmstrong (1988; 1989) also treats physical quantities and numbers\nthrough structural properties. The former involve, as in the above\nmass 1 kg example, smaller quantities such as mass 0.1\nkg and mass 0.2 kg (this view is criticized by Eddon\n2007). The latter are internal proportion relations between structural\nproperties (e.g., being a nineteen-electrons aggregate) and\nunit-properties (e.g., being an electron). Moreover,\nstructural properties have been appealed to in treatments of laws of\nnature (Armstrong 1989; Lewis 1986a), some natural kinds (Armstrong\n1978b, 1997; Hawley & Bird 2011), possible worlds (Forrest 1986),\nersatz times (Parsons 2005), emergent properties\n(O’Connor & Wong 2005), linguistic types (Davis 2014), ontic\nstructural realism (Psillos 2012). However, structural universals have\nalso been questioned on various grounds, as we shall now see. \nLewis (1986a) raises two problems for the pictorial conception. First,\nit is not clear how one and the same universal (e.g.,\nhydrogen) can recur more than once in a structural universal.\nLet us dub this “multiple recurrence problem”. Secondly,\nstructural universals violate the Principle of Uniqueness of\nComposition of classical\n mereology.\n According to this principle, given a certain collection of parts,\nthere is only one whole that they compose. Consider isomers, namely,\nmolecules that have the same number and types of atoms but different\nstructures, e.g., butane and isobutane\n(C4H10). Here, butane and\nisobutane are different structural universals. Yet, they\narise from the same universals recurring the same number of times. Let\nus dub this “isomer problem.” \nTwo further problems may be pointed out. First, even molecules with\nthe same number and types of atoms and the same structures may vary in\nvirtue of their spatial orientation (Kalhat 2008). This phenomenon is\nknown as chirality. How can structural properties account for\nit? Secondly, the composition of structural properties is restricted:\nnot every collection of properties gives rise to a structural\nproperty. This violates another principle of classical mereology: the\nPrinciple of Unrestricted Composition. \nLewis dismisses alternatives to the pictorial conception, such as the\n“linguistic conception” (in which structural universals\nare set-theoretic constructions out of simple universals) and the\n“magic conception” (in which structural universals\nare not complex and are primitively connected to the relevant\nproperties). Moreover, he also rejects the possibility of there being\namphibians, i.e., particularized universals lying between\nparticulars and full-fledged universals. Amphibians would solve the\nmultiple recurrence problem, as they would be identical with multiple\nrecurrences of single universals. For example, in methane,\nthere would be four amphibians of hydrogen. \nTo reply to Lewis’ challenges, two main strategies have been\nadopted on behalf of the pictorial conception: a non-mereological\ncomposition strategy, according to which structural properties do not\nobey the principles of classical mereology, and a mereology-friendly\nstrategy. Let us start with the former. \nArmstrong (1986) admits that the composition of structural universals\nis non-mereological. In his 1997, he emphasizes that states of affairs\ndo not have a mereological kind of composition, and views universals,\nincluding structural ones, as states of affairs-types which,\nas such, are not mereological in their composition. Structural\nuniversals themselves turn out to be state of affairs-types of a\nconjunctive sort (1997: 34 ff.). To illustrate, let us go back to the\nabove example with H2O exemplified by the water\nmolecule \\(w\\). It involves the conjunction of these states of\naffairs: \nThis conjunction of states of affairs provides an example of a\nstate of affairs-type identifiable with the structural universal\nH2O. \nIn pursuit of the non-mereological composition strategy, Forrest\n(1986; 2006; 2016) relies on logically compound properties, in\nparticular (in his 2016) conjunctive, existentially quantified and\nreflexive ones. Bennett (2013) argues that entities are part of\nfurther entities by occupying specific slots within the latter.\nParthood slots are distinct from each other. Therefore, which entity\noccupies which slot matters to the composition of the resultant\ncomplex entity. Hawley (2010) defends the possibility of there being\nmultiple composition relations. In a more general way, McDaniel (2009)\npoints out that the relation of structure-making does not obey some of\nthe principles of classical mereology. Mormann (2010) argues that\ndistinct categories (to be understood as in\n category theory)\n come together with distinct parthood and composition relations. \nAs regards the mereology-friendly strategy, it has been suggested that\nstructural properties actually include extra components accounting for\nstructures, so that the Principle of Uniqueness of Composition is\nsafe. Considering methane, Pagès (2002) claims that\nsuch a structural property is composed of the properties\ncarbon and hydrogen, a bonding relation and\na peculiar first-order, formal relation between the atoms. According\nto Kalhat (2008), the extra component is a second-order arrangement\nrelation between the first-order properties. Ordering formal\nrelations—together with causally individuated\nproperties—are also invoked by McFarland (2018). \nAt the intersection of these strategies, Bigelow and Pargetter (1989,\n1991) claim that structural universals are internally relational\nproperties that supervene on first-order properties and relations and\non second-order proportion relations. Second-order proportion\nrelations are relations such as having four times as. They\nrelate first-order properties and relations. For example, in\nmethane, the relation having four times as relates\ntwo conjunctive properties: (i) hydrogen and being part of this\nmolecule; (ii) carbon and being part of this\nmolecule. \nCampbell (1990) solves the multiple recurrence problem and the isomer\nproblem by appealing to tropes. In methane, there are\nmultiple hydrogen tropes. In butane and isobutane,\ndistinct tropes entertain distinct structural relations. \nDespite Lewis’ dismissal, a number of theories appeal to\namphibians (i.e., particularized universals lying between particulars\nand full-fledged universals) or, more precisely, to entities similar\nto amphibians. Fine (2017) suggests that structural properties should\nbe treated by invoking arbitrary objects (Fine 1985). Davis’\n(2014) account of linguistic types as structural properties confronts\nthe problem of the multiple occurrence of one type, e.g.,\n“dog”, in another (e.g., “every dog likes another\ndog”) (Wetzel 2009). In general, the idea that types are\nproperties of tokens is a natural one, although there are also\nalternative views on the matter (see entry on\n types and tokens).\n Be this as it may, Davis proposes that types cannot occur within\nfurther types as tokens: they can only occur as subtypes.\nTherefore, subtypes lie, like amphibians, between types and tokens.\nSubtypes are individuated by their positions in asymmetric wholes,\nwhereas they are primitively and non-qualitatively distinct in\nsymmetric ones. The approach could be extended to properties such as\nmethane, which would be taken to have four distinct\nhydrogen subtypes. \nWhen it comes to the metaphysical underpinnings of scientific\ntheories, properties play a prominent role: it appears that science\ncan hardly be done without appealing to them. This adds up to the case\nfor realism about properties and to our understanding of them. We\nshall illustrate this here first by dwelling on some miscellaneous\ntopics and then by focusing on a debate regarding the very nature of\nthe properties invoked in science, namely whether or not they are\nessentially dispositional. Roughly, an object exemplifies a\ndispositional property, such as soluble or\nfragile, by having a power or disposition to act or being\nacted upon in a certain way in certain conditions. For example, a\nglass’ disposition of being fragile consists in its\npossibly shattering in certain conditions (e.g., if struck with a\ncertain force). In contrast, something exemplifies a\ncategorical property, e.g., made of salt or\nspherical, by merely being in a certain way (see entry on\n dispositions). \nMany predicates in scientific theories (e.g., “being a\ngene” and “being a belief”) are functionally\ndefined. Namely, their meaning is fixed by appealing to some function\nor set of functions (e.g., encoding and transmitting genetic\ninformation). To make sense of functions, properties are needed.\nFirst, functions can be thought of as webs of causal relationships\nbetween properties or property-instances. Secondly, predicates such as\n“being a gene” may be taken to refer to\nhigher-level properties, or at least to something that has\nsuch properties. In this case, the property of being a gene\nwould be the higher-level property of possessing some further\nproperties (e.g., biochemical ones) that play the relevant\nfunctions (i.e., encoding and transmitting genetic information).\nAlternatively, being a gene would be a property that\nsatisfies the former higher-level property. Thirdly, the ensuing\nrealization relationships between higher-level and function-playing\nproperties can only be defined by appealing to properties (see entry\non\n functionalism). \nMore generally, many ontological\ndependence  and reduction\nrelationships primarily concern properties: type-identity (Place 1956;\nSmart 1959; Lewis 1966) and token-identity (Davidson 1980) (see entry\non\n the mind/brain identity theory),\n supervenience (Horgan 1982; Kim 1993; entry on\n supervenience);\n realization (Putnam 1975; Wilson 1999; Shoemaker 2007), \nscientific reduction\n(Nagel 1961). Moreover,\na non-reductive relation such as ontological emergence (Bedau 1997;\nPaolini Paoletti 2017b) is typically characterized as a relation\nbetween emergent properties\nand more fundamental\nproperties. Even mechanistic explanations often appeal to properties\nand relations in characterizing the organization, the components, the\npowers and the phenomena displayed by mechanisms (Glennan & Illari\n2018; entry on\n mechanisms in science). \nEntities in nature are typified by\n natural kinds.\n These are mostly thought of as properties or property-like entities\nthat carve nature at its joints (Campbell, O'Rourke, & Slater\n2011) at distinct layers of the universe: microphysical (e.g.,\nbeing a neutron), chemical (e.g., being gold),\nbiological (e.g., being a horse). \nPhysical quantities such as mass or length are typically treated as\nproperties, specifiable in terms of a magnitude, a certain number, and\na unit measure, e.g., kg or meter, which can itself be specified in\nterms of properties (Mundy 1987; Swoyer 1987). Following Eddon’s\n(2013) overview, it is possible to distinguish two main strands here:\nrelational and monadic properties theories (see also\nDasgupta 2013). In relational theories (Bigelow & Pargetter 1988;\n1991), quantities arise from proportion relations, which may in turn\nbe related by higher-order proportion relations. Consider a certain\nquantity, e.g., mass 3 kg. Here the thrice as massive\nas proportion relation is relevant, which holds of certain pairs\nof objects \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(a\\) is thrice as massive as\n\\(b\\). By virtue of such relational facts, the first members of such\npairs have a mass of 3 kg. Another relational approach is by Mundy\n(1988), who claims that mass 3 kg is a relation between\n(ordered pairs of) objects and numbers. For example, mass 3\nkg is a relation holding between the ordered pair \\(\\langle a,\nb\\rangle\\) (assuming that \\(a\\) is thrice as massive as \\(b\\), and not\nthe other way round) and the number 3; or—if relations have\nbuilt-in relational order—between \\(a, b\\) and 3. Knowles (2015)\nholds a similar view, wherein physical quantities are relations that\nobjects bear to numbers. According to the monadic properties approach,\nquantities are intrinsic properties of objects (Swoyer 1987; Armstrong\n1988; 1989). As we saw, Armstrong develops such a view by taking\nquantities to be structural properties. Related metaphysical inquiries\nconcern the dimensions of quantities (Skow 2017) and the status of\nforces (Massin 2009). \nLastly, properties play a prominent role in two well-known accounts of\nthe\n laws of nature:\n the nomological necessitation account and law\ndispositionalism. The former has been expounded by Tooley (1977;\n1987), Dretske (1977) and Armstrong (1983). Roughly, following\nArmstrong, a law of nature consists in a second-order and external\nnomological necessitation relation \\(\\rN\\), contingently holding\nbetween first-order universals \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\): \\(\\rN(P, Q)\\). Such a\nhigher-order fact necessitates certain lower-order regularities, i.e.,\nall the objects that have \\(P\\) also have \\(Q\\) (by nomological\nnecessity, in virtue of \\(\\rN(P, Q))\\). Law dispositionalism\ninterprets laws of nature by appealing to dispositional properties.\nAccording to it, laws of nature “flow” from the essence of\nsuch properties. This implies that laws of nature hold with\nmetaphysical necessity: whenever the dispositions are in place, the\nrelevant laws must be in place too (Cartwright 1983; Ellis 2001; Bird\n2007; Chakravartty 2007; Fischer 2018; see also Schrenk 2017 and\nDumsday 2019). (For criticisms, see, e.g., van Fraassen 1989 as\nregards the former approach, and McKitrick 2018 and Paolini Paoletti\n2020b, as regards the latter). \nThere is a domestic dispute among supporters of properties in the\nmetaphysics of science, regarding the very nature of such properties\n(or at least the fundamental ones). We may distinguish two extreme\nviews, pure dispositionalism and pure\ncategoricalism. According to the former, all properties are\nessentially dispositional (“dispositional”, for\nbrevity’s sake, from now on), since they are nothing more than\ncausal powers; their causative roles, i.e., which effects\ntheir instantiations can cause, exhaust their essences. According to\npure categoricalism, all properties are essentially categorical (in\nbrief, “categorical”, in the following), because their\ncausative roles are not essential to them. If anything is essential to\na property, it is rather a non-dispositional and intrinsic aspect\ncalled “quiddity” (after Armstrong 1989), which need not\nbe seen as an additional entity over and above the property itself\n(Locke 2012, in response to Hawthorne 2001). Between such views there\nlie a number of intermediate positions. \nPure dispositionalism has been widely supported in the last few\ndecades (Mellor 1974; 2000; Shoemaker 1984: ch. 10 and 11 [in terms of\ncausal roles]; Mumford 1998; 2004; Bird 2005; 2007; Chakravartty 2007;\nWhittle 2008; see Tugby 2013 for an attempt to argue from this sort of\nview to a Platonist conception of properties). There are three main\narguments in favor of it. First, pure dispositionalism easily accounts\nfor the natural necessity of the laws of nature, insofar as such a\nnecessity just “flows” from the essence of the\ndispositional properties involved. Secondly, dispositional properties\ncan be easily known as they really are, because it is part of their\nessence that they affect us in certain ways. Thirdly, at the\n(presumably fundamental) micro-physical level, properties are only\ndescribed dispositionally, which is best explained by their being\ndispositional (Ellis & Lierse 1994; N. Williams 2011). \nNevertheless, pure dispositionalism is affected by several problems.\nFirst, some authors believe that it is not easy to provide a clear-cut\ndistinction between dispositional and would-be non-dispositional\nproperties (Cross 2005). Secondly, it seems that the essence of\ncertain properties does not include, or is not exhausted by, their\ncausative roles: qualia, inert and epiphenomenal\n properties,[14]\n structural and geometrical properties, spatio-temporal properties\n(Prior 1982; Armstrong 1999; for some responses, see Mellor 1974 and\nBird 2007; 2009). Thirdly, there can be symmetrical causative\nroles. Consider three distinct properties \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) such\nthat \\(A\\) can cause \\(B\\), \\(B\\) can cause \\(A\\), \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) can\ntogether cause \\(C\\) and nothing else characterizes \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have the same causative role. Therefore, in pure\ndispositionalism, they turn out to be identical, against the\nhypothesis (Hawthorne 2001; see also Contessa 2019). Fourthly,\naccording to some, pure dispositionalism falls prey to (at least)\nthree distinct regresses (for a fourth regress, see Psillos 2006).\nSuch regresses arise from the fact that the essential causative role\nof a dispositional property \\(P\\) “points towards” further\nproperties \\(S\\), \\(T\\), etc. qua possible effects. The\nessential causative roles of the latter “point towards”\nstill other properties, and so on. The first regress concerns the\nidentity of \\(P\\), which is never fixed, as it depends on the identity\nof further properties, which depend for their identity on still other\nproperties, and so on (Lowe 2006; Barker 2009; 2013). The second\nregress concerns the knowability of \\(P\\) (Swinburne 1980). \\(P\\) is\nonly knowable through its possible effects (i.e., the instantiation of\n\\(S\\), \\(T\\), etc.), included in its causative role. Yet, such\npossible effects are only knowable through their possible effects, and\nso on. The third regress concerns the actuality of \\(P\\) (Armstrong\n1997). \\(P\\)’s actuality is never reached, since \\(P\\) is\nnothing but the power to give rise to \\(S\\), \\(T\\), etc., which are\nnothing but the powers to give rise to further properties, and so on.\nFor responses to these regresses, see Molnar 2003; Marmodoro 2009;\nBauer 2012; McKitrick 2013; see also Ingthorsson 2013. \nPure categoricalism seems to imply that causative roles are only\ncontingently associated to a property. Therefore, on pure\ncategoricalism, a property can possibly have distinct causative roles,\nwhich allows it to explain—among other things—the apparent\ncontingency of causative roles and the possibility of recombining a\nproperty with distinct causative roles. Its supporters include Lewis\n(1986b, 2009), Armstrong (1999), Schaffer (2005), and more recently\nLivanios (2017), who provides further arguments based on the\nmetaphysics of science. Kelly (2009) and Smith (2016) may be added to\nthe list, although they take roles to be non-essential and necessary\n(for further options, see also Kimpton-Nye 2018, Yates 2018a, Coates\nforthcoming and Tugby forthcoming). \nHowever, pure categoricalism falls prey to two sorts of difficulties.\nFirst, the contingency of causative roles has some unpalatable\nconsequences: unbeknownst to us, two distinct properties can swap\ntheir roles; they can play the same role at the same time; the same\nrole can be played by one property at one time and by another property\nat a later time; an “alien” property can replace a\nfamiliar one by playing its role (Black 2000). Secondly, and more\ngenerally, we are never able to know which properties play which\nroles, nor are we able to know the intrinsic nature of such\nproperties. This consequence should be accepted with “Ramseyan\nhumility” (Lewis 2009; see also Langton 1998 for a related,\nKantian, sort of humility) or it should be countered in the same way\nas we decide to counter any broader version of skepticism (Schaffer\n2005). On this issue, see also Whittle (2006); Locke (2009); Kelly\n(2013); Yates (2018b). \nLet us now turn to some intermediate positions. \nAccording to dualism (Ellis 2001; Molnar 2003), there are\nboth dispositional and categorical properties. Dualism is meant to\ncombine the virtues of pure dispositionalism and pure categoricalism.\nIt then faces the charge of adopting a less parsimonious ontology,\nsince it accepts two classes of properties rather than one, i.e.,\ndispositional and categorical ones. \nAccording to the identity theory (Heil 2003; 2012; Jaworski\n2016; Martin 2008; G. Strawson 2008; see also N. Williams 2019), every\nproperty is both dispositional and categorical (or qualitative). The\nmain problem here is how to characterize the distinction and relation\nof these two “sides”. Martin and Heil suggest that they\nare two distinct ways of partially considering one and the same\nproperty, whereas Mumford (1998) explores the possibility of seeing\nthem as two distinct ways of conceptualizing the property in question.\nHeil claims that the qualitative and the dispositional sides need to\nbe identified with one another and with the whole property. Jacobs\n(2011) holds that the qualitative side consists in the possession of\nsome qualitative nature by the property, whereas the dispositional\nside consists in that property being (part of) a sufficient truthmaker\nfor certain counterfactuals. Dispositional and qualitative sides may\nalso be seen as essential, higher-order properties of properties, as\nsupervenient and ontologically innocent aspects of properties\n(Giannotti 2019), or as constituents of the essence of properties\n(Taylor 2018). In general, the identity theory is between Scylla and\nCharybdis. If it reifies the dispositional and qualitative sides, it\nruns the risk of implying some sort of dualism. If it insists on the\nidentity between them, it runs the opposite risk of turning into a\npure dispositionalist theory (Taylor 2018). \nFormal property theories are logical systems that aim at formulating\n“general noncontingent laws that deal with properties”\n(Bealer & Mönnich 1989: 133). In the next subsection we shall\noutline how they work. In the two subsequent subsections we shall\nbriefly consider their deployment in natural language semantics and\nthe foundations of mathematics, which can be taken to provide further\nreasons for the acknowledgment of properties in one’s ontology,\nor at least of certain kinds of properties. \nThese systems allow for terms corresponding to properties, in\nparticular variables that are meant to range over properties and that\ncan be quantified over. This can be achieved in two ways. Either\n(option 1; Cocchiarella 1986a) the terms standing for properties are\npredicates or (option 2; Bealer 1982) such terms are subject terms\nthat can be linked to other subject terms by a special predicate that\nis meant to express a predication relation (let us use\n“pred”) pretty much as in standard set theory a special\npredicate, “\\(\\in\\)”, is used to express the membership\nrelation. To illustrate, given the former option, an assertion such as\n“there is a property that both John and Mary have” can be\nrendered as \\[\\notag \\exists P(P(j) \\amp P(m)).\\] \nGiven the second option, it can be rendered as \\[\\notag \\exists x(\\textrm{pred}(x, j) \\amp \\textrm{pred}(x, m)).\\] \n(The two options can be combined as in Menzel 1986; see Menzel 1993\nfor further discussion). \nWhatever option one follows, in spelling out such theories one\ntypically postulates a rich realm of properties. Traditionally, this\nis done by a so-called comprehension principle which, intuitively,\nasserts that, for any well-formed formula (“wff”) \\(A\\),\nwith \\(n\\) free variables, \\(x_1 , \\ldots ,x_n\\), there is a\ncorresponding \\(n\\)-adic property. Following option 1, it goes as\nfollows: \\[\\tag{CP} \\exists R^n \\forall x_1 \\ldots \\forall x_n(R^n(x_1 ,\n\\ldots ,x_n) \\leftrightarrow A). \\] \nAlternatively, one can use a variable-binding operator, \\(\\lambda\\),\nthat, given an open wff, generates a term (called a “lambda\nabstract”) that is meant to stand for a property. This way to\nproceed is more flexible and is followed in the most recent versions\nof property theory. We shall thus stick to it in the following. To\nillustrate, we can apply “\\(\\lambda\\)” to the open\nformula, “\\((R(x) \\amp S(x))\\)” to form the one-place\ncomplex predicate “[\\(\\lambda x (R(x) \\amp S(x))\\)]”; if\n“\\(R\\)” denotes being red and “\\(S\\)”\ndenotes being square, then this complex predicate denotes the\ncompound, conjunctive property being red and square.\nSimilarly, we can apply the operator to the open formula\n“\\(\\exists y(L(x, y))\\)” to form the one-place predicate\n“[\\(\\lambda x \\exists y(L(x, y))\\)]”; if\n“\\(L\\)” stands for loves, this complex predicate\ndenotes the compound property loving someone (whereas\n“[\\(\\lambda y \\exists x(L(x, y))\\)]” would denote\nbeing loved by someone). To ensure that lambda abstracts\ndesignate the intended property, one should assume a “principle\nof lambda conversion”. Given option 1, it can be stated\nthus: \\[\\tag{\\(\\lambda\\)-conv} [\\lambda x_1\\ldots x_n A](t_1 , \\ldots\n,t_n) \\leftrightarrow A(x_1 /t_1 , \\ldots ,x_n /t_n).\\] \n\\(A(x_1 /t_1 , \\ldots ,x_n /t_n)\\) is the wff resulting from\nsimultaneously replacing each \\(x_i\\) in \\(A\\) with \\(t_i\\) (for \\(1\n\\le i \\le n)\\), provided \\(t_i\\) is free for \\(x_i\\) in \\(A\\)). For\nexample, given this principle, [\\(\\lambda x (R(x) \\amp S(x))](j)\\) is\nthe case iff \\((R(j) \\amp S(j))\\) is also the case. \nStandard second-order logic allows for predicate variables bound by\nquantifiers. Hence, to the extent that these variables are taken to\nrange over properties, this system could be seen as a formal theory of\nproperties. Its expressive power is however limited, since it does not\nallow for subject terms that stand for properties. Thus, for example,\none cannot even say of a property \\(F\\) that \\(F = F\\). This is a\nserious limitation if one wants a formal tool for a realm of\nproperties whose laws one is trying to explore. Standard higher order\nlogics beyond the second order obviate this limitation by allowing for\npredicates in subject position, provided that the predicates that are\npredicated of them belong to a higher type. This presupposes a grammar\nin which predicates are assigned types of increasing levels, which can\nbe taken to mean that the properties themselves, for which the\npredicates stand for, are arranged into a hierarchy of types. Thus,\nsuch logics appropriate one version or another of the type theory\nconcocted by Russell to tame his own paradox and related conundrums.\nIf a predicate can be predicated of another predicate only if the\nformer is of a type higher than the latter, then self-predication is\nbanished and Russell’s paradox cannot even be formulated.\nFollowing this line, we can construct a type-theoretical formal\nproperty theory. The simple theory of types, as presented, e.g., in\nCopi (1971), can be seen as a prototypical version of such a property\ntheory (if we neglect the principle of extensionality assumed by\nCopi). The type-theoretical approach keeps having supporters. For\nexample, it is followed in the property theories embedded in\nZalta’s (1983) theory of abstract objects and more recently in\nthe metaphysical systems proposed by Williamson (2013) and Hale\n(2013). \nHowever, for reasons sketched in\n §2.4,\n type theory is hardly satisfactory. Accordingly, many type-free\nversions of property theory have been developed over the years and no\nconsensus on what the right strategy is appears to be in sight. Of\ncourse, without type-theoretical constraints, given \\((\\lambda\\)-conv)\nand classical logic (CL), paradoxes such as Russell’s\nimmediately follow (to see this, consider this instance of\n\\((\\lambda\\textrm{-conv}): [\\lambda x {\\sim}x(x)]([\\lambda x\n{\\sim}x(x)]) \\leftrightarrow{\\sim}[\\lambda x {\\sim}x(x)]([\\lambda x\n{\\sim}x(x)])\\)). In formal systems where abstract singular terms or\npredicates may (but need not) denote properties (Swoyer 1998), formal\ncounterparts of (complex) predicates like “being a property that\ndoes not exemplify itself” (formally, “[\\(\\lambda x\n{\\sim}x(x)\\)]”) could exist in the object language without\ndenoting properties; from this perspective, Russell’s paradox\nmerely shows that such predicates do not stand for properties\n(similarly, according to Schnieder 2017, it shows that it is not\npossible that a certain property exists). But we would like to have\ngeneral criteria to decide when a predicate stands for a property and\nwhen it does not. Moreover, one may wonder what gives these predicates\nany significance at all if they do not stand for properties. There are\nthen motivations for building type-free property theories in which all\npredicates stand for properties. We can distinguish two main strands\nof them: those that weaken CL and those that circumscribe\n\\((\\lambda\\)-conv) (some of the proposals to be mentioned below are\nformulated in relation to set theory, but can be easily translated\ninto proposals for property theory). \nAn early example of the former approach was offered in a 1938 paper by\nthe Russian logician D. A. Bochvar (Bochvar 1938 [1981]), where the\nprinciple of excluded middle is sacrificed as a consequence of the\nadoption of what is now known as Kleene’s weak three-valued\nscheme. An interesting recent attempt based on giving up excluded\nmiddle is Field 2004. A rather radical alternative proposal is to\nembrace a paraconsistent logic and give up the principle of\nnon-contradiction (Priest 1987). A different way of giving up CL is by\nquestioning its structural rules and turn to a substructural logic, as\nin Mares and Paoli (2014). The problem with all these approaches is\nwhether their underlying logic is strong enough for all the intended\napplications of property theory, in particular to natural language\nsemantics and the foundations of mathematics. \nAs for the second strand (based on circumscribing \\((\\lambda\\)-conv)),\nit has been proposed to read the axioms of a standard set theory such\nas ZFC, minus extensionality, as if they were about properties rather\nthan sets (Schock 1969; Bealer 1982; Jubien 1989). The problem with\nthis is that these axioms, understood as talking about sets, can be\nmotivated by the iterative conception of sets, but they seem rather\nad hoc when understood as talking about properties\n(Cocchiarella 1985). An alternative can be found in Cocchiarella\n1986a, where \\((\\lambda\\)-conv) is circumscribed by adapting to\nproperties the notion of stratification used by Quine for sets. This\napproach is however subject to a version of Russell’s paradox\nderivable from contingent but intuitively possible facts (Orilia 1996)\nand to a paradox of hyperintensionality (Bozon 2004) (see Landini 2009\nand Cocchiarella 2009 for a discussion of both). Orilia (2000; Orilia\n& Landini 2019) has proposed another strategy for circumscribing\n\\((\\lambda\\)-conv), based on applying to exemplification Gupta’s\nand Belnap’s theory of circular definitions. \nIndependently of the paradoxes (Bealer & Mönnich 1989: 198\nff.), there is the issue of providing identity conditions for\nproperties, specifying when it is the case that two properties are\nidentical. If one thinks of properties as meanings of natural language\npredicates and tries to account for intensional contexts, one will be\ninclined to assume rather fine-grained identity conditions, possibly\neven allowing that [\\(\\lambda x(R(x) \\amp S(x))\\)] and [\\(\\lambda\nx(S(x) \\amp R(x))\\)] are distinct (see Fox & Lappin 2015 for an\napproach based on operational distinctions among computable\nfunctions). On the other hand, if one thinks of properties as causally\noperative entities in the physical world, one will want to provide\nrather coarse-grained identity conditions. For instance, one might\nrequire that [\\(\\lambda x A\\)] and [\\(\\lambda x B\\)] are the same\nproperty iff it is physically necessary that \\(\\forall x(A\n\\leftrightarrow B)\\). Bealer (1982) tries to combine the two\napproaches (see also Bealer & Mönnich\n 1989)[15]. \nThe formal study of natural language semantics started with Montague\nand gave rise to a flourishing field of inquiry (see entry on\n Montague semantics).\n The basic idea in this field is to associate to natural language\nsentences wffs of a formal language, in order to represent sentence\nmeanings in a logically perspicuous manner. The association reflects\nthe compositionality of meanings: different syntactic subcomponents of\nsentences correspond systematically to syntactic subcomponents of the\nwffs; subcomponents of wffs thus represent the meanings of the\nsubcomponents of the sentences. The formal language eschews\nambiguities and has its own formal semantics, which grants that\nformulas have logical properties and relations, such as logical truth\nand entailments, so that in particular certain sequences of formulas\ncount as logically valid arguments. The ambiguities we normally find\nin natural language sentences and the entailment relations that link\nthem are captured by associating ambiguous sentences to different\nunambiguous wffs, in such a way that when a natural language argument\nis felt to be valid there is a corresponding sequence of wffs that\ncount as a logically valid argument. In order to achieve all this,\nMontague appealed to a higher-order logic. To see why this was\nnecessary, one may focus on this valid argument: \ntherefore, \nTo grant compositionality in a way that respects the syntactic\nsimilarity of the three sentences (they all have the same\nsubject-predicate form), and the validity of the argument, Montague\nassociates (1)–(3) to formulas such as these: \\[ \\tag{1a} [\\lambda F \\forall x(\\mathrm{G}(x) \\rightarrow\nF(x)](\\mathrm{M}); \\] \\[ \\tag{2a} [\\lambda F \\exists x(\\forall y(P(x)\n\\rightarrow x = y) \\amp F(x))](G); \\] \\[ \\tag{3a} [\\lambda F \\exists\nx(\\forall y(P(x) \\rightarrow x = y) \\amp F(x))](\\mathrm{M}). \\] \nThe three lambda abstracts in (1a)–(3a) represent, respectively,\nthe meanings of the three noun phrases in (1)–(3). These\nlambda-abstracts occur in predicate position, as predicates of\npredicates, so that (1a)–(3a) can be read, respectively, as:\nevery Greek is instantiated by being mortal; the\npresident of Greece is instantiated by being Greek;\nthe president of Greece is instantiated by being\nmortal. Given lambda-conversion plus quantifier and propositional\nlogic, the argument is valid, as desired. It should be noted that\nlambda abstracts such as these can be taken to stand for peculiar\nproperties of properties, classifiable as denoting concepts\n(after Russell 1903; see Cocchiarella 1989). One may then say then\nthis approach to semantics makes a case for the postulation of\ndenoting concepts, in addition to the more obvious and general fact\nthat it grants properties as meanings of natural language predicates\n(represented by symbols of the formal language). \nThis in itself says nothing about the nature of such properties. As we\nsaw in\n §3.1,\n Montague took them to be intensions as set-theoretically\ncharacterized in terms of possible worlds. Moreover, he took them to\nbe typed, since, to avoid logical paradoxes, he relied on type theory.\nAfter Montague, these two assumptions have been typically taken for\ngranted in natural language semantics, though with attempts to recover\nhyperintensionality somehow (Cresswell 1985) in order to capture the\nsemantics of propositional attitudes verbs such as\n“believe”, affected by the phenomena regarding mental\ncontent hinted at in\n §3.1.\n However, the development of type-free property theories has suggested\nthe radically different road of relying on them to provide logical\nforms for natural language semantics (Chierchia 1985; Chierchia &\nTurner 1988; Orilia 2000b; Orilia & Landini 2019). This allows one\nto capture straightforwardly natural language inferences that appear\nto presuppose type-freedom, as they feature quantifiers that bind\nsimultaneously subject and predicate positions (recall the example of\n §1.2).\n Moreover, by endowing the selected type-free property theory with\nfine-grained identity conditions, one also accounts for propositional\nattitude verbs (Bealer 1989). Thus, we may say that this line makes a\ncase for properties understood as untyped and highly fine-grained. \nSince the systematization in the first half of last century, which\ngave rise to paradox-free axiomatizations of set\ntheory such as ZFC, sets are\ntypically taken for granted in the foundations of mathematics and it\nis well known that they can do all the works that numbers can do. This\nhas led to the proposal of identifying numbers with sets.\nRussell’s type theory was an alternative that rather relied on\nproperties (viewed as propositional functions), in backing up a\nlogicist reduction of mathematics to logic. In essence, the idea was\nthat properties can do all the work that sets are supposed to do, thus\nmaking the latter dispensable. Hence, Russell spoke of his approach as\na “no-classes” theory of classes (see Landini 2011: 115,\nand §2.4 of the entry on\n Russell’s logical atomism;\n cf. Bealer 1982: 111–119, and Jubien 1989 for followers of this\nline). Following this line, numbers are then seen as properties rather\nthan sets. \nThe Russellian approach did not encounter among mathematicians a\nsuccess comparable to that of set theory. Nevertheless, from an\nontological point of view, it appears to be more economical in its\nrelying on properties, to the extent that the latter are needed any\nway for all sorts of explanatory jobs, reviewed above, which sets,\nqua extensional entities, can hardly perform. As we have\nseen, type theory is problematic. However, type-free property theories\ncan come to the rescue by replacing typed properties with untyped ones\nin the foundations of mathematics. And in fact the advocates of such\ntheories have often proposed to recover the logicist program, in\nparticular by identifying natural numbers with untyped properties of\nproperties (Bealer 1982; Cocchiarella 1986b; Orilia 2000b).
