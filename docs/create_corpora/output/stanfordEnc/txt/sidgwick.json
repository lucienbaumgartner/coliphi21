His masterpiece, The Methods of\nEthics was first published in 1874 (seventh edition: 1907) and in\nmany ways marked the culmination of the classical utilitarian\ntradition—the tradition of Jeremy Bentham and James and John\nStuart Mill—with its emphasis on “the greatest happiness\nof the greatest number” as the fundamental normative demand.\nSidgwick’s treatment of that position was more comprehensive and\nscholarly than any previous one, and he set the agenda for most of the\ntwentieth-century debates between utilitarians and their critics.\nUtilitarians and consequentialists from G. E. Moore and Bertrand\nRussell to J. J. C. Smart and R. M. Hare down to Derek Parfit, Peter\nSinger and Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek have acknowledged\nSidgwick’s Methods as a vital source for their\narguments. But in addition to authoritatively formulating\nutilitarianism and inspiring utilitarians and their sympathizers, the\nMethods has also served as a general model for how to do\nethical theory, since it provides a series of systematic, historically\ninformed comparisons between utilitarianism and its leading\nalternatives.\n\n\nEven such influential critics of utilitarianism as William Frankena,\nMarcus Singer, and John Rawls have looked to Sidgwick’s work for\nguidance. C. D. Broad, a later successor to Sidgwick’s Cambridge\nchair, famously went so far as to say\n“Sidgwick’s Methods of Ethics seems to me to be\non the whole the best treatise on moral theory that has ever been\nwritten, and to be one of the English philosophical classics”\n(Broad 1930: 143). In recent years, Broad’s assessment has been\nendorsed by an increasing number of prominent philosophers (Parfit\n2011; de Lazari-Radek & Singer 2014; and Crisp 2015). Engaging\nwith Sidgwick’s work remains an excellent way to cultivate a\nserious philosophical interest in ethics, metaethics, and practical\nethics, not to mention the history of these subjects. Moreover, he\nmade important contributions to many other fields, including\neconomics, political theory, classics, educational theory, and\nparapsychology. His significance as an intellectual and cultural\nfigure has yet to be fully appreciated, but recent years have\nwitnessed an impressive expansion of Sidgwick studies, and he has even\nbeen featured in popular novels (Cohen 2010; Entwistle 2014). \n\n\nSidgwick was born on May 31, 1838, in the small Yorkshire town of\nSkipton. The extended Sidgwick family was well-known in the area and\nquite prosperous, with their cotton-spinning mills representing the\noldest manufacturing firms in the town (Dawson 1882, Schultz 2017).\nBut Henry was the second surviving son of Mary Crofts and the Reverend\nWilliam Sidgwick, the headmaster of the grammar school in Skipton, who\ndied when Henry was only three. Henry’s older brother William\nwent on to become an Oxford don, as did his younger brother Arthur.\nHis sister Mary, known as Minnie, ended up marrying a second cousin,\nEdward White Benson, who in addition to being an early mentor of\nHenry’s (and Rugby master) went on to become the archbishop of\nCanterbury. The Sidgwick and Benson families would contribute much to\nEnglish letters and science over the course of the 19th and 20th\ncenturies, though their legacies have also been controversial on some\ncounts (Askwith 1971; Schultz 2004, 2017; Bolt 2011; and Goldhill\n2016). \nHenry was educated at Rugby and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where\nhe took his degree in 1859. As an undergraduate, he excelled at both\nmathematics and, especially, classics, in due course becoming Craven\nScholar, 33rd Wrangler, and Senior Classic, also winning the\nChancellor’s Medal. He wound up staying at Cambridge his entire\nlife, first, beginning in October of 1859, as a Fellow of Trinity and\na lecturer in classics—a position that in the later sixties\nevolved into a lectureship in the moral sciences—then, from\n1875, as praelector in moral and political philosophy, and finally,\nfrom 1883, as Knightbridge Professor of Moral Philosophy. He resigned\nhis Fellowship in 1869 because he could no longer subscribe in good\nconscience to the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England, as\nthe position required. This act helped inspire the successful\nopposition to such requirements. In 1881 he was elected an honorary\nFellow, and in 1885, he regained a full Fellowship, remarking on the\nchanging times: “Last time I swore that I would drive away\nstrange doctrine; this time I only pledged myself to restore any\nCollege property that might be in my possession when I ceased to be a\nFellow” (Sidgwick and Sidgwick, 1906: 400). \nSidgwick’s Cambridge career was rich in reformist activity\n(Rothblatt 1968; Harvie 1976; and Todd 1999). As an undergraduate,\nhe had been elected to the “Apostles,” the secret\nCambridge discussion society that did much to shape the intellectual\ndirection of modern Cambridge; Sidgwick’s allegiance to this\ngroup was a very significant feature of his life and work (Lubenow\n1998). The 1860s, which he described as his years of “Storm and\nStress” over his religious views and commitments, were also the\nyears in which his identity as an academic liberal took shape, and he\ngot caught up in a range of causes emphasizing better and broader\neducational opportunities, increased professionalism, and greater\nreligious freedom. He evolved into an educational reformer committed\nto downplaying the influence of classics, introducing modern subjects,\nand opening up higher education to women. Much influenced by the\nwritings of F. D. Maurice and J. S. Mill, he would become one of the\nleading proponents of higher education for women and play a guiding\nrole in the foundation of Newnham College, Cambridge, one of the first\ncolleges for women in England (Tullberg [1975], 1998, and Sutherland\n2006). He was also active in the cause of university reorganization\ngenerally, in due course serving on the General Board of Studies, the\nSpecial Board for Moral Sciences, and the Indian Civil Service Board,\nand he worked tirelessly to expand educational opportunities and\nprofessionalize educational efforts through such vehicles as\ncorrespondence courses, extension lectures, the Cambridge Working\nMen’s College, and the University Day Training College for\nteachers (initiated by Oscar Browning). Such educational reforms were,\nhe held, also of political value in overcoming class conflict and\nsocial strife. But Sidgwick’s broader political commitments,\nwhich ranged from academic liberal to Liberal Unionist—he joined\nthe breakaway faction of the Liberal Party opposing Gladstone’s\npolicy of Home Rule for Ireland—to independent, were complex and\nshifting; he was not, alas, always able to rise above the marked\nimperialistic and orientalist tendencies of the late Victorian era\n(Schultz 2004, 2007; and Bell 2007, 2016). \nIn 1876 Sidgwick married Eleanor Mildred Balfour, the sister of his\nformer student, Arthur Balfour, the future prime minister. An\naccomplished and independent woman with serious scientific\ninterests—she collaborated with her brother-in-law Lord Rayleigh\non many scientific papers—Eleanor Sidgwick worked as an equal\npartner with her husband on many fronts, particularly higher education\nfor women and parapsychology. She eventually took over as Principal of\nNewnham in 1892, and was for many decades a mainstay of the Society\nfor Psychical Research, an organization that Henry had helped to found\n(in 1882) and several times headed, though his interest in the\nparanormal had been evident long before. The Sidgwicks hoped that\ntheir psychical research might ultimately support some core religious\nclaims, particularly concerning the personal survival of physical\ndeath, which they deemed a vital support for morality. Their extensive\nand often quite methodologically sophisticated investigations were not\nas conclusive as they had hoped, but following Henry’s death\nfrom cancer on August 28, 1900, Eleanor did become persuaded that he\nhad succeeded in communicating from “the other world.” The\nSidgwicks’ work in this field continues to this day to be\ndebated by academic parapsychologists (Gauld 1968, and Braude\n2003). \nAlthough Sidgwick published extensively in his lifetime, he is best\nknown for his first major book, The Methods of Ethics, which\nfirst appeared in 1874 and went through five editions during his\nlifetime. His second most widely read book would be his Outlines\nof the History of Ethics for English Readers, which appeared in\n1886 as an expanded version of the article on the subject that he had\ncontributed to the famous ninth edition of the Encyclopedia\nBritannica. But he also published The Principles of Political\nEconomy (1883), The Elements of Politics (1891), and\nPractical Ethics, A Collection of Addresses and Essays\n(1898), and after his death, Eleanor Sidgwick worked with various of\nhis former colleagues to bring out Lectures on the Ethics of T. H.\nGreen, H. Spencer, and J. Martineau (1902), Philosophy, Its\nScope and Relations (1902), The Development of European\nPolity (1903), Miscellaneous Essays and Addresses\n(1904), Lectures on the Philosophy of Kant and Other Philosophical\nLectures and Essays (1905), and Henry Sidgwick, A Memoir\n(1906), which Eleanor and Arthur Sidgwick assembled largely from his\ncorrespondence and journal. These posthumous works are typically quite\npolished and shed a great deal of light on the works that Sidgwick\nhimself saw through publication (Schneewind 1977). \nAs Sidgwick’s publications attest, he was not only a pre-eminent\nmoral philosopher, with sophisticated views on both going\ncontroversies in ethics and metaethics and the history of these\nsubjects, but also an accomplished epistemologist, classicist,\neconomist, political theorist, political historian, literary critic,\nparapsychologist, and educational theorist. If he was a founder of the\nCambridge school of philosophy, he was also a founder of the Cambridge\nschool of economics (along with his colleague and sometimes nemesis\nAlfred Marshall) and of the Cambridge school of political theory\n(along with such colleagues as Browning and Sir John Seeley). If such\nstudents as Moore and Russell owed him much, so too did such students\nand admirers as Balfour, J. N. Keynes, F. W. Maitland, F. Y.\nEdgeworth, James Ward, Frank Podmore, and E. E. Constance Jones. He\nhad serious interests in many areas of philosophy and theology, and\nalso wrote insightfully about poetry and literature, two of his great\nloves (at Newnham, he lectured on Shakespeare, along with such\nsubjects as philosophy and economics). Indeed, Sidgwick was a force in\nthe larger cultural developments of his age, active in such\ninfluential discussion societies as the Metaphysical Society and the\nSynthetic Society. His friends included George Eliot, T. H. Green,\nJames Bryce, H. G. Dakyns, Roden Noel, and, of special importance,\nJohn Addington Symonds, the erudite cultural historian, poet, and man\nof letters who was a pioneer in the serious historical study of same\nsex love (Schultz 2004). Sidgwick’s versatile and many-sided\nintellect—not to mention his keen wit—are typically better\ndisplayed in his essays and letters than in his best-known academic\nbooks. He was in fact much loved for his gentle humor (or\n“Sidgwickedness”) and sympathetic conversation, and his\nphilosophical students prized him for his candor. As Balfour put it:\n“Of all the men I have known he was the readiest to consider\nevery controversy and every controversialist on their merits. He never\nclaimed authority; he never sought to impose his views; he never\nargued for victory; he never evaded an issue.” (Sidgwick and\nSidgwick, 1906: 311). \nSidgwick’s Methods was long in the making. His\ncorrespondence with his close friend H. G. Dakyns, a Clifton master\nwho had been a private tutor for the Tennyson family, reveals how long\nand volatile the development of his ethical views was, particularly\nduring the 1860s when he was working himself free of Anglican\northodoxy. As early as 1862, he wrote to Dakyns that he was\n“revolving a Theory of Ethics” and working on “a\nreconciliation between the moral sense and utilitarian theories”\n(Sidgwick and Sidgwick, 1906: 75). He started telling people that he\nwas “engaged on a Great Work,” which would indeed turn out\nto be the case. By 1867, much of the basic intellectual structure of\nthe Methods was clearly in place; according to Marshall, at\nthe faculty discussion group known as the “Grote Club,”\nSidgwick “read a long & general sketch of the various\nsystems of morality: I. Absolute right II. Make yourself noble III.\nMake yourself happy IV Increase the general happiness. In the course\nof it he committed himself to the statement that without appreciating\nthe effect of our action on the happiness of ourselves or of others we\ncould have no idea of right & wrong” (quoted in Schultz\n2004: 142). \nIt was also in 1867 that Sidgwick sent a draft of his pamphlet on\n“The Ethics of Conformity and Subscription” to J. S. Mill,\ninviting comments. This work, part of his efforts with the Free\nChristian Union (an organization for promoting free and open religious\ninquiry), reflected his casuistical struggles over whether he had a\nright to keep his Fellowship, given his increasingly Theistic views.\nHe had been increasingly drawn to Theism, which then, as now, stressed\nthat “God’s will and purpose, and God’s assurance of\nan ultimate fulfilment, are behind all that is happening”\n(Polkinghorne 1998: 114), but without the orthodox commitments to\nbelief in the Trinity, miracles, eternal punishment, etc.. As Sidgwick\nexplained to his sister: “I have written a pamphlet … on\nthe text ‘Let every man be fully persuaded in his own\nmind.’ That is really the gist of the pamphlet—that if the\npreachers of religion wish to retain their hold over educated men they\nmust show in their utterances on sacred occasions the same sincerity,\nexactness, unreserve, that men of science show in expounding the laws\nof nature. I do not think that much good is to be done by saying this,\nbut I want to liberate my soul, and then ever after hold my\npeace” (Sidgwick and Sidgwick, 1906: 226). As he put it in the\npamphlet, which appeared in 1870: \nThis was a vision of inquiry and even culture that Sidgwick would\npromote throughout his life (Schultz 2004, 2011, 2017), though after\nthis point he no longer openly directed his criticisms at the church.\nMill had replied to his effort to address the question of subscription\non “objective” and “utilitarian” grounds:\n“What ought to be the exceptions … to the general duty of\ntruth? This large question has never yet been treated in a way at once\nrational and comprehensive, partly because people have been afraid to\nmeddle with it, and partly because mankind have never yet generally\nadmitted that the effect which actions tend to produce on human\nhappiness is what constitutes them right or wrong” (quoted in\nSchultz 2004: 134). Mill urged Sidgwick to turn his “thoughts\nto this more comprehensive subject,” and apparently when the\nlatter did, he concluded that it would not be conducive to the general\nhappiness to continue his open attacks on organized religion. The\nreasons for this larger conclusion are only partly evident from the\nMethods itself. \nSidgwick did always explicitly claim, however, that his struggles with\nthe ethics of subscription shaped the views set forth in the\nMethods. These struggles had led him “back to\nphilosophy” from his more theological and philological\ninvestigations—for which he had learned German and Hebrew and\nstruggled with biblical hermeneutics. He found the problem of whether\nhe ought to resign his Fellowship very “difficult, and I may say\nthat it was while struggling with the difficulty thence arising that I\nwent through a good deal of the thought that was ultimately\nsystematised in the The Methods of Ethics” (Sidgwick\nand Sidgwick, 1906: 38). One of the ways in which this is evident has\nbeen highlighted in the work of J. B. Schneewind, whose\nSidgwick’s Ethics and Victorian Moral Philosophy (1977)\nwas the most comprehensive and sophisticated commentary on\nSidgwick’s ethics produced in the twentieth century. As part of\nan extensive account of the historical context of the\nMethods, underscoring how Sidgwick’s work was shaped by\nboth the utilitarian tradition and its intuitionist and religious\nopposition (represented in part by the “Cambridge\nMoralists” William Whewell, Julius Hare, F. D. Maurice, and John\nGrote), Schneewind argued that \nThat account, as both Schneewind and Rawls have stressed, repeatedly\naffirms that the aim of the book is less practice than knowledge,\n“to expound as clearly and as fully as my limits will allow the\ndifferent methods of Ethics that I find implicit in our common moral\nreasoning; to point out their mutual relations; and where they seem to\nconflict, to define the issue as much as possible.” That is,\nechoing his views on theological inquiry, he confesses that: \nThe model for such an approach is not Bentham or even J. S. Mill, but\nAristotle, whose Ethics gave us “the Common Sense\nMorality of Greece, reduced to consistency by careful comparison:\ngiven not as something external to him but as what\n‘we’—he and others—think, ascertained by\nreflection.” This was really, in effect, “the Socratic\ninduction, elicited by interrogation” (Sidgwick 1874 [1907:\nxix]). \nAs Marcus Singer and others have observed (Singer 1974),\nSidgwick’s notion of a “method” of ethics is not the\nsame as that of an ethical principle, ethical theory, or ethical\ndecision-procedure. A “method” is a way of\n“obtaining reasoned convictions as to what ought to be\ndone” and thus it might reflect a commitment to one or more\nethical principles as the ultimate ground of one’s determination\nof what one has most reason to do, here and now, while allowing that\none might ordinarily be reasoning from such principles either directly\nor indirectly. Thus, one might, on theological grounds, hold that the\nmoral order of the universe is utilitarian, with God willing the\ngreatest happiness of the greatest number, while also holding that the\nappropriate guide for practical reason is enlightened self-interest,\nsince utilitarian calculations are God’s business and God has\nordered the cosmos to insure that enlightened self-interest conduces\nto the greatest happiness. In this case, one’s “method of\nethics” would be rational egoism, but the ultimate philosophical\njustification for this method would appeal to utilitarian principles.\nStill, despite this emphasis on the reasoning process between\nprinciples and practical conclusions—another reflection of his\nstruggles with subscription—Sidgwick obviously had quite a bit\nto say in the Methods about the defense of the ultimate\nprinciples of practical reason (Crisp 2014, 2015). \nMany have felt that, in setting up the systematic comparison between\nthe main methods of ethics, Sidgwick was not nearly as neutral and\nimpartial as he thought, and in various ways slanted the discussion\nagainst a wide range of alternatives, including Aristotelian and other\nforms of perfectionism, Whewellian rationalism, Idealism, and more\n(Donagan 1977, 1992; Irwin 1992, 2007, and 2011; Hurka 2014a,\n2014b). He simply dismisses the traditional philosophical concern with\nthe “moral faculty,” explaining that he is going to leave\nthat matter to psychologists. For Sidgwick, in any given situation,\nthere is something that it is right or that one ought to do, and this\nis the proper sphere of ethics. The basic concept of morality is this\nunique, highly general notion of “ought” or\n“right” that is irreducible to naturalistic terms, sui\ngeneris, though moral approbation is “inseparably bound up\nwith the conviction, implicit or explicit, that the conduct approved\nis ‘really’ right—that is, that it cannot without\nerror, be disapproved by any other mind” (Sidgwick 1874 [1907:\n27]).  On this count, at least, his student G. E. Moore was willing to\ndeclare the Methods untainted by the “naturalistic\nfallacy”—that is, the confusion of the “is” of\nattribution and the “is” of identity that supposedly\ninfected much previous ethical theory, including that of Bentham and\nthe Mills. And indeed, it is plain that Sidgwick parted company from\nclassical utilitarianism in many ways, rejecting the empiricism,\npsychological egoism, and associationism (supposedly) characteristic\nof the earlier tradition. F.H. Hayward, who wrote one of the first\nbooks on Sidgwick’s ethics, famously complained that E. E.\nConstance Jones had missed just how original Sidgwick was:\n“Sidgwick’s identification of ‘Right’ with\n‘Reasonable’ and ‘Objective’; his view of\nRightness as an ‘ultimate and unanalysable notion’\n(however connected subsequently with Hedonism); and his admission that\nReason is, in a sense, a motive to the will, are due to the more or\nless ‘unconscious’ influence of Kant. Miss Jones appears\nto think that these are the common-places of every ethical system, and\nthat real divergences only arise when we make the next step in\nadvance. I should rather regard this Rationalistic terminology as\nsomewhat foreign to Hedonism. I do not think that Miss Jones will\nfind, in Sidgwick’s Hedonistic predecessors, any such emphasis\non Reason (however interpreted)” (Hayward 1900–1: 361).\nSidgwick himself allowed that Kant was one of his\n“masters,” and he was also quite familiar with the works\nof Hegel. Schneewind’s reading (Schneewind 1977) has stressed\nthis influence, along with the influence of Joseph Butler, whose works\npersuaded Sidgwick of the falsity of psychological egoism and of the\nreality of other than self-interested actions (Frankena 1992).\nIndeed, the comparison between Sidgwick and Kant has proved to be a\nfertile and ongoing source of academic work on Sidgwick, and one of\nincreasing significance (Parfit 2011; Paytas 2018) \nHowever, despite the considerable influence Kant and\nKantianism—and the Cambridge Moralists—exercised on\nSidgwick, the Methods also deviated from some stock features\nof such views, among other things rejecting the issue of free will as\nlargely irrelevant to ethical theory and failing to appreciate the\nKantian arguments about expressing one’s autonomy and the\nincompatibility of the categorical imperative and rational egoism. As\nSchneewind allows, Sidgwick’s \nNaturally, a Sidgwickian position on the venerable free will issue is\nbound to be controversial, and recent work on the Sidgwick/Kant\ncomparison has brought out how divided commentators continue to be on\nthis matter (Crisp 2015; Skelton 2016; Paytas 2018). Moreover,\nthere has also been significant controversy over just how internalist\nSidgwick’s account of moral motivation actually was. On balance,\nhe held that the dictates or imperatives of reason were\n“accompanied by a certain impulse to do the acts recognized as\nright,” while admitting that other impulses may conflict\n(Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 34]). Brink (1988, 1992) has urged that some of\nSidgwick’s chief arguments make better sense if he is construed,\nin externalist fashion, as allowing the possibility that one may have\ngood reasons not to be moral. But Sidgwick’s moderate, qualified\ninternalism seems plain and plausible enough to most commentators\n(Schultz 2004; de Lazari-Radek & Singer 2014; and Crisp\n2015). \nThere has been perhaps even more controversy surrounding\nSidgwick’s account of the “good.” The\nMethods is at least fairly clear in arguing that the\ndifference between “right” and “good” in part\nconcerns the way in which judgments of ultimate good do not\nnecessarily involve definite precepts to act or even the assumption\nthat the good in question is attainable or the best attainable good\nunder the circumstances. Rightness and goodness thus “represent\ndifferentiations of the demands of our own rationality as it applies\nto our sentient and our active powers” (Schneewind 1977: 493).\nBut Sidgwick offers an intricate account of ultimate good that has\nstruck some as highly naturalistic. In A Theory of Justice,\nRawls famously explained that Sidgwick “characterizes a\nperson’s future good on the whole as what he would now desire\nand seek if the consequences of all the various courses of conduct\nopen to him were, at the present point of time, accurately foreseen by\nhim and adequately realized in imagination. An individual’s good\nis the hypothetical composition of impulsive forces that results from\ndeliberative reflection meeting certain conditions” (Rawls,\n[1971], 1999: 366). Many have followed the Rawlsian line in casting\nSidgwick as a defender of a naturalistic\n“full-information” account of the “good” (for\nexample, Sobel 1994, and Rosati 1995), but the balance of scholarly\nopinion has it that Sidgwick’s account adumbrates an\n“objective list” view that allows that some desires,\nhowever informed, may be rejected as irrational or unreasonable (see\nespecially Schneewind 1977; de Lazari-Radek & Singer 2014; and\nParfit 1984, 2011). Crisp (1990, 2015) and Shaver (1997) provide\nhelpful reviews of the debates; although the former offers perhaps the\nbest possible defense of the interpretation of Sidgwick’s view\nas a naturalistic full-information account (with an experience\nrequirement), it also admits that the objective list reading is a more\ncharitable one. \nSome commentators have made much of the difference between Sidgwick\nand Moore on the notion of ultimate good, urging that whereas Sidgwick\nprioritizes an unanalysable notion of “right,” Moore\nprioritizes an unanalysable notion of “good,” while adding\na suspect ontological claim about “goodness” involving a\nnon-natural property (Moore 1903; and Shaver 2000). However, Hurka\n(2003) has offered some forceful arguments against most such\naccounts: \nMoreover, as Hurka has developed the point, the “initial\nreviewers of Principia did not see it as altering\nSidgwick’s ontology but emphasized its continuity with Sidgwick,\nwhile Moore himself said little about his non-natural property and\neven tried to limit his metaphysical claims, saying that though\ngoodness is an object and therefore ‘is somehow’,\nit does not ‘exist’, and in particular does not exist in a\n‘supersensible reality’ ” (Hurka 2014: 90).\nFor his part, Sidgwick goes on to argue that the best going account of\nultimate goodness is a hedonistic one, and that this is an\ninformative, non-tautological claim, though also a more controversial\none than many of the others that he defends. As Irwin and Richardson\nhave insightfully argued, Sidgwick’s hedonistic commitments, and\nhis criticisms of such views as T. H. Green’s, often reflected\nthe (problematic) conviction that practical reason simply must be\nfully clear and determinate in its conclusions (Irwin 1992:\n288–90; Richardson 1997). Without some such metric as the\nhedonistic one, Sidgwick argued, how can one virtue be compared to\nanother? And can one really recommend making people more virtuous at\nthe expense of their happiness? What if the virtuous life were\nconjoined to extreme pain, with no compensating good to anyone? But\nhere again, Sidgwick’s arguments are not as perspicuous as they\nat first seem. Admittedly, as Shaver points out, “Sidgwick works\nout what it is reasonable to desire, and so attaches moral to natural\nproperties, by the ordinary gamut of philosopher’s\nstrategies—appeals to logical coherence, plausibility, and\njudgment after reflection.” (Shaver 1997: 270). Even so, as\nRawls noted, “Sidgwick denies that pleasure is a measurable\nquality of feeling independent of its relation from volition. This is\nthe view of some writers, he says, but one he cannot accept. He\ndefines pleasure ‘as a feeling which, when experienced by\nintelligent beings, is at least apprehended as desirable or—in\ncases of comparison—preferable.’ It would seem that the\nview he here rejects is the one he relies upon later as the final\ncriterion to introduce coherence among ends.” (Rawls [1971],\n1999: 488). Sumner, in an important treatment, has also urged that\nSidgwick and Mill, by contrast with Bentham, \nAlthough the last few years have seen a remarkable rehabilitation of\nethical hedonism, particularly in the works of Crisp (2006, 2007, and\n2015), Feldman (2004, 2010), and de Lazari-Radek and Singer (2017),\nthe forms of hedonism being defended usually reconfigure or qualify\nthe Sidgwickian approach in important ways. Crisp, who defends an\ninternalist account of pleasure, even urges that Sidgwick’s\nwritings did not express his better inclinations on the subject\n“Sidgwick is at heart an internalist about pleasure who was\nmislead by the heterogeneity argument into offering an externalist\nview which is open to serious objections” (Crisp 2007: 134).\nIndeed, on this count, Sidgwick might appear to be defending a\nposition that is “intermediate between internalism and\nexternalism,” as de Lazari-Radek and Singer note in their recent\nand very informed defenses of Sidgwickian hedonism against all the\nother alternatives, including the desire satisfaction view that Singer\nhad previously adopted (de Lazari-Radek & Singer 2014: 254, 2016).\nHowever, Shaver (2016) has offered a subtle account and defense of\nSidgwick’s notion of pleasure as feeling apprehended, perhaps\nwrongly, as desirable qua feeling, rather than as feeling manifesting\na special tone of pleasantness.  \nThis rehabilitation of Sidgwickian hedonism has also involved a\nrecognition of the importance of the hedonimetrics of F. Y. Edgeworth,\nthe brilliant economist who was a slightly junior contemporary of\nSidgwick’s and one of his most enthusiastic philosophical\ndisciples, though one whose work has until recently been largely\nignored in philosophical commentary on Sidgwick (Edgeworth 1877 and\n1881 [2003]). Edgeworth’s approach has been revived in economics by\nsuch figures as Kahneman (2011), and the convergence of economic and\nphilosophical (and neurobiological) interests on this point suggests\nthat Sidgwickian hedonism represents a new growth area in ethics. But\nit does seem that in key respects Sidgwick’s account remains\nsuperior to these more recent developments, which rely on a rather\ncrude claim about pleasurable consciousness as a state that a subject\nwishes to prolong. \nFor better or worse, Sidgwick uses the language of hedonism to label\ntwo out of the three methods with which he will be chiefly\nconcerned—namely, egoistic hedonism (or rational egoism) and\nuniversal hedonism (or utilitarianism). The third method is variously\ncalled dogmatic or intuitional morality, which is somewhat ambiguously\nconstrued as either the (mostly negative) precepts of common-sense\nmorality or the somewhat more refined version of these set out in the\ntheories of such moral theorists as Whewell or Henry Calderwood\n(Whewell 1864; Calderwood 1876; and Donagan 1977, 1992). The main\npoint of such views is that conformity to such moral duties as\ntruth-telling, promise-keeping, temperance etc. is held to be\n“the practically ultimate end of moral actions” and these\nduties are “unconditionally prescribed” and discernible\nwith “really clear and finally valid intuition,” though it\nis the job of the moral theorist to set them out with proper precision\nand “to arrange the results as systematically as possible, and\nby proper definitions and explanations to remove vagueness and prevent\nconflict.” (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 101]). Indeed, the plain person\nis apt to be rather confused about the differences between the methods\nof ethics, arbitrarily deploying one or another without recognizing\nany inconsistency. \nThe three methods of ethics—egoism, intuitional morality, and\nutilitarianism—respectively form the subject matter of books two\nthrough four of the Methods, which brackets them with an\nopening book reviewing the whole work and a concluding chapter on\n“The Mutual Relations of the Three Methods.” Each of these\nbooks represents in itself a classic treatment of the view at issue,\nthough it is the chapter on utilitarianism that has perhaps most often\nbeen treated as such. This architectonic can, however, make it\nsomewhat difficult to follow the thread of Sidgwick’s thought,\nparticularly on the more philosophical points having to do with\nintuitionism. Indeed, intuitionism figures in both the second method\nof ethics, and, in a more philosophical form, in the treatment of all\nthe methods of ethics, particularly when it comes to the discussion of\nfundamental principles. As Sidgwick explains, although some might\nthink that conscience delivers immediate judgments on particular\nacts—a view he variously calls aesthetic, perceptional or ultra\nintuitionism—“reflective persons, in proportion to their\nreflectiveness, come to rely rather on abstract universal intuitions\nrelating to classes of cases conceived under general notions.”\nHence, dogmatic intuitional morality, which in the Methods is\nrather awkwardly taken to cover both more deontological views and\nnon-hedonistic teleological ones, on the ground that the latter tend\nto construe virtue in the same fashion as the simply the done thing,\nwhatever the consequences. But the process of reflection should not\nstop there: there is another, more sophisticated phase of\nintuitionism. Without “being disposed to deny that conduct\ncommonly judged to be right is so, we may yet require some deeper\nexplanation why it is so.” Thus, philosophical\nintuitionism, “while accepting the morality of common sense as\nin the main sound, still attempts to find for it a philosophic basis\nwhich it does not itself offer: to get one or more principles more\nabsolutely and undeniably true and evident, from which the current\nrules might be deduced, either just as they are commonly received or\nwith slight modifications and rectifications.” (Sidgwick 1874\n[1907: 102]), \nThe ascent to this philosophical intuitionism is especially evident in\nthe treatment of common-sense or intuitional morality. As Sidgwick\nexplained in reply to Calderwood’s critical review of the\nMethods, which asked why he had not simply confined himself\n“to the consideration of Intuitionism in its most philosophical\nform,” that tactic “would have led me at once to\nUtilitarianism: because I hold that the only moral intuitions which\nsound philosophy can accept as ultimately valid are those which at the\nsame time provide the only possible philosophical basis of the\nUtilitarian creed. I thus necessarily regard Prof. Calderwood’s\nIntuitionism as a phase in the development of the Intuitional method,\nwhich comes naturally between the crude thought of Butler’s\n‘plain man’ and the Rational Utilitarianism to which I\nultimately endeavor to lead my reader.” That is, allowing that\nthe morality of common sense is his as well, he must as a philosopher\nnonetheless \nAnd as he explained in another important commentary on the\nMethods, “The Establishment of Ethical First\nPrinciples,” he accepts Aristotle’s distinction between\nlogical priority and priority in the knowledge of a particular person,\nsuch that we “are thus enabled to see that a proposition may be\nself-evident, i.e., may be properly cognisable without being viewed in\nconnexion with any other propositions; though in order that its truth\nmay be apparent to some particular mind, there is still required some\nrational process connecting it with propositions previously accepted\nby that mind.” This latter can be done in two ways: by showing\nhow “some limited and qualified statement” supposed to be\nself-evident is only part of a “simpler and wider\nproposition,” on which the limitations turn out to be arbitrary,\nand by establishing some general criteria “for distinguishing\ntrue first principles” that are then used to “construct a\nstrictly logical deduction by which, applying their general criteria\nto the special case of ethics, we establish the true first principles\nof this latter subject” (Sidgwick 1879: 106–7). Truth\nbeing one, both tactics should ultimately converge on the same\nconclusions. \nWhether Sidgwick succeeded in avoiding mere “hostile criticism\nfrom the outside” in his analysis of common-sense morality is\nopen to debate; certainly, the critical reflection can seem quite\nremorseless, with the utilitarian repeatedly demonstrating to the\ndogmatic intuitionist \nTime and again, common sense collapses into utilitarian thinking, or\nis shown to presuppose it, or is at least revealed as requiring\nsomething very like it. This effort to criticize and assimilate\ncommon-sense moral rules went far beyond the efforts of J. S. Mill and\nhas served as a template for the utilitarian or consequentialist work\nof Smart (1973), Brandt (1979), Hare (1981), Parfit (1984, 2011,\n2017), Hardin (1988), Singer (2001), Gibbard (1982, 1990), and de\nLazari-Radek and Singer (2014). Like so many in the utilitarian\ntradition, Sidgwick ended up recognizing the moral standing of\nnon-human animals, puzzling over questions of suicide, defending a\nnotion of intention covering all foreseen consequences, rejecting\npurely retributive accounts of punishment, embracing a cosmopolitan\n(rather than nationalistic) outlook, and thinking—though not\npublic insisting—that orthodox religion and its morality were\noften dogmatic and superstitious. He initiated the (modern)\nphilosophical discussion of the problem of future generations and\noptimal population growth, arguing that “strictly conceived, the\npoint up to which, on Utilitarian principles, population ought to be\nencouraged to increase, is not that at which average happiness is the\ngreatest possible … but that at which the produce formed by\nmultiplying the number of persons living into the amount of average\nhappiness reaches its maximum” (Sidgwick 1874 [1907:\n415–16]).  But he was not always consistent in his treatment of\nthis issue (Schultz 2004, 2017). \nAlthough it can seem strained and anachronistic to apply the\nclassification of “act” or “rule”\nutilitarianism to Sidgwick, the scholarly consensus does for the most\npart classify him as an act utilitarian (Gray 1989; Williams 1995;\nHooker 2000; de Lazari-Radek & Singer 2014; and Crisp 2015). In\nany event, it is quite clear that he defended an\n“indirect” form of utilitarianism; indeed, he goes rather\nfar in defending the possibility of utilitarianism entailing a\nself-effacing, even esoteric morality: \nSuch provocative remarks, which flatly contradict any Kantian\ninsistence on the necessary publicity of fundamental moral principles,\nmay reflect a consistent interpretation of the different\n“levels” of moral thinking, critical versus everyday, but\nthey have generated much criticism, with Williams charging that\nSidgwick was a “Government House” utilitarian whose views\ncomported well with colonialism (Williams 1995, and Schultz 2004,\n2017). Yet even on the count of esoteric morality, Sidgwick’s\nviews have attracted some forceful recent defenders (Singer & de\nLazari-Radek 2010, and de Lazari-Radek & Singer 2014, 2016) who\nstrike at the very heart of the Kantian and neo-Kantian publicity\nrequirement. Their argument owes much to Parfit’s demonstration\nthat an ethical theory could be self-effacing without being incoherent\nor untrue (Parfit 1984). \nAgain, Sidgwick has often been charged with slanting his discussion\nagainst a wide range of alternatives (Donagan 1977, 1992; Irwin\n1992, 2007, and 2011; Hurka 2014). And at times it is very far from\nclear whose views he is criticizing. Thus, his account of\n“aesthetic intuitionism” would seem to be trained on a\ncertain form of Aristotelianism stressing the contextual and\nparticularist nature of practical wisdom (McDowell 1979; Dancy 2004;\nand Hurka 2014), but, in a curiously neglected work on the history of\nethics that was in some ways a successor to Sidgwick’s own\nOutlines (and contained an extended treatment of\nSidgwick’s views), Reginald A. P. Rogers identified aesthetic\nintuitionism with the moral sense theory of Shaftesbury (Rogers\n1911). Furthermore, of special concern to recent intuitionists has\nbeen the effort to combine Sidgwick’s views with those of Ross\non prima facie intuitions, acknowledging that Sidgwick’s account\nof intuitional morality did not address such an option (Hurka 2014a,\n2014b; and Crisp 2015). Hurka has developed this critique forcefully,\nexpanding on his claim that Sidgwick’s framing of ethical theory\nwas slanted from the start: Sidgwick \nFor others, however, it is clear enough that Sidgwick’s\nhedonistic utilitarianism does not require any Rossian apparatus for\nrecognizing apparent conflicts of duties. De Lazari-Radek and Singer,\nin response to Crisp’s defense of Rossian prima facie\nintuitions, argue that “Ross starts by assuming that, as he puts\nit, ‘the main moral convictions of the plain man’ are\n‘not opinions which it is for philosophy to prove or disprove,\nbut knowledge from the start.’ As we have already indicated both\nin our book and in this response, we are skeptical about the validity\nof most of our moral intuitions” (de Lazari-Radek & Singer\n2016). Sidgwick would probably not have deemed the Rossian gambit to\nthe point for purposes of dealing with the dualism of practical\nreason. \nMore generally, it must be said that Sidgwick, under the influence of\nHegel and other historically-minded philosophers, did not claim that\nhe was impartially addressing all historically important methods of\nethics, but only those that in his estimate had become the live\noptions as humanity had progressed (Schultz 2013, 2014). He may\nhave been somewhat misguided in identifying those, but that is not the\nsame as being blind to the content of the alternatives. \nAt any rate, fair or not, Sidgwick’s reconciliation of\nintuitional morality and utilitarianism obviously deploys a\nsophisticated form of intuitionist epistemology, one allowing for the\nfallibilism of its conclusions. He formulates four criteria or\nconditions “the complete fulfillment of which would establish a\nsignificant proposition, apparently self-evident, in the highest\ndegree of certainty attainable: and which must be approximately\nrealised by the premises of our reasoning in any inquiry, if that\nreasoning is to lead us cogently to trustworthy conclusions”\n(Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 338]). The first, often called simply the\n“Cartesian Criterion,” demands that the “terms of\nthe proposition must be clear and precise,” and the second\nrequires that the “self-evidence of the proposition must be\nascertained by careful reflection,” which is especially\nimportant in ethics because “any strong sentiment, however\npurely subjective, is apt to transform itself into the semblance of an\nintuition; and it requires careful contemplation to detect the\nillusion” (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 339]). Third, the “propositions\naccepted as self-evident must be mutually consistent,” since it\n“is obvious that any collision between two intuitions is a proof\nthat there is error in one or the other, or in both.” (Sidgwick\n1874 [1907: 341]). And fourth, since “it is implied in the very notion\nof Truth that it is essentially the same for all minds, the denial by\nanother of a proposition that I have affirmed has a tendency to impair\nmy confidence in its validity.” This last adds an important\nsocial dimension to Sidgwick’s epistemology: “the absence\nof such disagreement must remain an indispensable negative condition\nof the certainty of our beliefs,” for “if I find any of my\njudgements, intuitive or inferential, in direct conflict with a\njudgment of some other minds, there must be error somewhere: and if I\nhave no more reason to suspect error in the other mind than in my own,\nreflective comparison between the two judgments necessarily reduces me\ntemporarily to a state of neutrality” (Sidgwick 1874 [1907:\n341–42]). In other, more purely epistemological works, Sidgwick\ncollapsed the first two conditions into one, such that his\nphilosophical intuitionism involved the three-pronged demand for\nclarity and ability to withstand critical reflection, consistency or\ncoherence, and consensus of experts. He was also apt to explain that\nthese conditions only afforded the best means for reducing the risk of\nerror, rather than establishing indubitable truth. On this count, such\nposthumous works as Lectures on the Philosophy of Kant (1905)\nand Philosophy, Its Scope and Relations (1902) provide\nimportant supplements to the Methods. Singer (2000) provides\nan excellent collection of those of Sidgwick’s essays and\nreviews most relevant to the Methods. \nPerhaps no region of Sidgwick’s work has been the subject of\ngreater interpretive controversy than his epistemology. The early work\nof Schneewind (1963), Rawls (1971, 1975), and Schultz (1992) played up\nthe dialectical side of Sidgwick’s approach and the ways in\nwhich he anticipated the Rawlsian account of the method of reflective\nequilibrium. Reactions to any such interpretation, which supposedly\naccorded a too generous role to “received opinion” in\nSidgwick’s methodology, came from Singer (1974) and many others\ninfluenced by Hare’s critique of Rawls (see also Sverdlik 1984,\nand especially, Skelton 2007, 2008, 2010). Rawls himself shifted his\nground somewhat in later work, playing up Sidgwick’s\n“rational intuitionism” (Rawls 1996, 2007). But other\nrecent accounts, notably Brink (1994) and Shaver (1999, 2011, and\n2014), have recognized that Sidgwick’s approach contains both\ndialectical and more purely intuitionist elements, debating whether\nthese can be combined in a consistent or coherent way. Recent work on\nSidgwick has also benefited from the renaissance in and rehabilitation\nof intuitionism, evident in such works as Audi (1997), Parfit (2011),\nand Stratton-Lake (2002); the latter contains an important\ncontribution by Crisp that effectively distances Sidgwick’s\nviews from cruder versions of intuitionism, though Deigh (2010) has\nargued forcefully that Sidgwick was too committed to an axiomatic\napproach that was undermined by developments in analytical philosophy,\na point in some ways reminiscent of Donagan’s (1977) critique of\nSidgwick’s intuitionism. Schultz (1992, 2004) surveys the\ndevelopment of some of these debates, but this is a very lively area\nof research in which the history of English moral philosophy from\nWhewell to Ross is being actively rewritten in dramatic fashion\n(Hurka 2011, 2014a). Yet it does appear that in the last decade, the\nscholarly emphasis has been disproportionately on Sidgwick and his\nsuccessors, notably Ross, rather than Sidgwick and his predecessors,\nnotably Whewell, who remains a comparatively neglected figure (Snyder\n2001 [2019], 2006). \nSidgwick’s epistemology is linked to other significant\ncontroversies as well, such as those concerning the degree to which he\ncan really be classified as a utilitarian, in any unqualified fashion.\nFor Sidgwick argues, over the course of the Methods, that\ncommon-sense or intuitional morality keeps giving way to more abstract\nformal principles as the better candidates for genuinely self-evident\ntruths. Although there is some controversy over just how many such\nprinciples he advances, at the least he defends a universalizability\nprinciple (one must be able to will one’s maxim to be a\nuniversal law) and a principle of rational prudence (or temporal\nneutrality, such that one should be ceteris paribus equally\nconcerned with all parts of one’s life), in addition to the\nutilitarian principle of rational benevolence. Controversially, he\nholds that the universalizability principle is merely formal and lacks\ncontent, being consistent with both egoism and utilitarianism, and\nthat temporal neutrality translates into a form of prudence. And in\nfact, even utilitarianism is actually derived from two more\nfundamental principles, and involves the “relation of the\nintegrant parts to the whole and to each other” in order to\nobtain “the self-evident principle that the good of any one\nindividual is of no more importance, from the point of view (if I may\nsay so) of the Universe, than the good of any other; unless, that is,\nthere are special grounds for believing the more good is likely to be\nrealised in the one case than in the other. And it is evident to me\nthat as a rational being I am bound to aim at good generally,—so\nfar as it is attainable by my efforts,—not at a particular part\nof it.” And from “these two rational intuitions we may\ndeduce, as a necessary inference, the maxim of Benevolence in an\nabstract form: viz. that each one is morally bound to regard the good\nof any other individual as much as his own, except in so far as he\njudges it to be less, when impartially viewed, or less certainly\nknowable or attainable by him” (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 382]). Thus, in\nhis more careful statements of the candidates for self-evident truths,\nSidgwick refrains from formulations directly invoking “the\ngreatest happiness of the greatest number” or hedonistic\nconsiderations. Some of the most sophisticated commentary on the\nMethods, such as Schneewind (1977), Shaver (1999, 2014),\nNakano-Okuno (2011), Parfit (2011), Phillips (2011), de Lazari-Radek\nand Singer (2014), Hurka (2014a), and Crisp (2015), has highlighted\nthe gap between these “axioms” and the substantive ethical\ntheories derived or developed from them. Sidgwick himself appreciated\nthe irony of his position, the way in which the hard-headed, reformist\nutilitarian emphasis on clarity and conclusiveness had dissipated in\nhis work: there are indeed “certain absolute practical\nprinciples, the truth of which, when they are explicitly stated, is\nmanifest; but they are of too abstract a nature, and too universal in\ntheir scope, to enable us to ascertain by immediate application of\nthem what we ought to do in any particular case; particular duties\nhave still to be determined by some other method” (Sidgwick\n1874 [1907: 379]). Common-sense rules have their place, but are not even\nclear enough to serve as the “middle axioms” of the\nutilitarian theory. As he put it to Dakyns: “Ethics is losing\nits interest for me rather, as the insolubility of its fundamental\nproblem is impressed on me. I think the contribution to the\nformal clearness & coherence of our ethical thought which\nI have to offer is just worth giving: for a few speculatively-minded\npersons—very few. And as for all practical questions of\ninterest, I feel as if I had now to begin at the beginning and learn\nthe ABC” (Sidgwick and Sidgwick, 1906: 277). \nWorse still, all was not happy even in the ethereal region of the\naxioms. The “insolubility” of the “fundamental\nproblem” of ethics—the key problem that had troubled\nSidgwick in the 1860s—was indeed on display in Sidgwick’s\ntreatise, in that he did not find the unified account of practical\nreason that he sought even at the more abstract level. As he had put\nit in an earlier letter to his friend Dakyns: “You know I want\nintuitions for Morality; at least one (of Love) is required to\nsupplement the utilitarian morality, and I do not see why, if we are\nto have one, we may not have others. I have worked away vigorously at\nthe selfish morality, but I cannot persuade myself, except by trusting\nintuition, that Christian self-sacrifice is really a happier life than\nclassical insouciance” (Sidgwick and Sidgwick, 1906: 90). The\nproblem of self-sacrifice and the claims of rational egoism were not,\non Sidgwick’s view, amenable to the same form of reconciliation\nwith utilitarianism that intuitional morality was. In fact, the first\nedition of the Methods concludes that rational egoism and\nutilitarianism end up in a stand-off, that there is a “dualism\nof the practical reason,” and that as a result, there is a\n“fundamental contradiction in our apparent intuitions of what is\nReasonable in conduct” such that “the ‘Cosmos’\nof Duty is thus really reduced to a Chaos, and the prolonged effort of\nthe human intellect to frame a perfect ideal of rational conduct is\nseen to have been foredoomed to inevitable failure” (Sidgwick \n1874 [1907: 473]). Later editions of the work sounded a somewhat less bleak\nconcluding note, but did not differ in substance. The main possible\nsolutions to the problem that Sidgwick considered are two, a weakening\nof epistemological standards, or a Theistic postulate about the\ncoherent moral government of the universe. On the first, he suggests\nthat if “we find that in our supposed knowledge of the world of\nnature propositions are commonly taken to be universally true, which\nseem to rest on no other ground than that we have a strong disposition\nto accept them, and that they are indispensable to the systematic\ncoherence of our beliefs,—it will be more difficult to reject a\nsimilarly supported assumption in ethics, without opening the door to\nuniversal scepticism” (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 509]). On the second, he\nexplains that if “we may assume the existence of such a Being,\nas God, by the consensus of theologians, is conceived to be,\nit seems that Utilitarians may legitimately infer the existence of\nDivine sanctions to the code of social duty as constructed on a\nUtilitarian basis; and such sanctions would, of course, suffice to\nmake it always every one’s interest to promote universal\nhappiness to the best of his knowledge” (Sidgwick 1874 [1907:\n506]). \nSidgwick often departed from the pristine language of the axioms when\ndescribing this conflict. In another important essay on his own work,\nhe explained that along with “(a) a fundamental moral conviction\nthat I ought to sacrifice my own happiness, if by so doing I can\nincrease the happiness of others to a greater extent than I diminish\nmy own, I find also (b) a conviction—which it would be\nparadoxical to call ‘moral’, but which is none the less\nfundamental—that it would be irrational to sacrifice any portion\nof my own happiness unless the sacrifice is to be somehow at some time\ncompensated by an equivalent addition to my own happiness”\n(Sidgwick 1889: 483). He urges that each of these convictions has as\nmuch clarity and certainty “as the process of introspective can\ngive” and each also finds wide assent “in the common sense\nof mankind.” Moreover, his account of rational egoism does not\nrely on a narrow or low-minded account of self-interest. Besides \nStill, he found it impossible to deny that even very high-minded\nversions of egoism posed a problem, prescribing actions conflicting\nwith the general good in such cases as heroic sacrifice of self in\nbattle, etc. This view, he suggested, could be found in Butler’s\nclaim that “Reasonable Self-love and Conscience are the two\nchief or superior principles in the nature of man,” each\ngenerating an obligation, though Frankena (1992) and Darwall (2000)\nhave raised questions about the historical accuracy of this\nattribution. But in any event, the basic point is that if “the\nEgoist strictly confines himself to stating his conviction that he\nought to take his own happiness or pleasure as his ultimate end, there\nseems no opening for an argument to lead him to Utilitarianism (as a\nfirst principle). But if he offers either as a reason for this\nconviction, or as another form of stating it, the proposition that his\nhappiness or pleasure is objectively ‘desirable’ or\n‘a good’, he gives the requisite opening. For the\nUtilitarian can then point out that his happiness cannot be\nmore objectively desirable or more a good than the happiness of any\none else; the mere fact … that he is he can have\nnothing to do with its objective desirability or goodness.”\n(Sidgwick 1873: 259–60). But the egoist need not make that\nmove—it is just as rational simply to take one’s own point\nof view as it is to take the point of view of the universe—of\nthe utilitarian superperson. \nSidgwick’s dualism has stimulated much controversy, even leading\nsome commentators to urge that he is better termed a\n“dualist” or “dual-source theorist” than a\nutilitarian (Crisp 2002). Moore (1903) famously dismissed the problem\non the grounds that the notion of one’s “own good”\nwas nonsense, but Mackie (1976) sharply countered that Moore was\nbegging the question. Broad (1930) claimed that Sidgwick’s\naccount was confused, since his proposed solutions did not touch the\nproblem of the inconsistent fundamental principles, though this has\nbeen effectively addressed by Coady (1994), Schneewind (1977) and many\nothers. Brink (1988) has argued that it is absurd to claim that two\nself-evident principles are inconsistent, but Shaver (1999) has\nreplied that Sidgwick is for the most part consistent in calling the\nprinciples at issue only “apparently” self-evident, though\nShaver also suggests that Sidgwick did not present a compelling case\nfor the egoistic side of the conflict. Skorupski (2000) has forcefully\nargued that there is no dualism of the “pure” practical\nreason, which is agent neutral, but there are many such conflicts in\nthe larger field of less than pure practical reason, not merely a\nconflict with egoistic reasons. Parfit, too, has recently argued that\nSidgwick’s two standpoints approach failed to capture how\negoistic reasons can be weaker than omnipersonal ones (Parfit 2011),\nthough Smith (2009) has defended Sidgwick’s construction of the\nproblem. And Baier (1995) has argued that Sidgwick’s account\nsuffers from various ambiguities because he does not clearly\ndistinguish “requiring” reasons from\n“permissive” ones, which would avoid the contradiction.\nIndeed, more generally, it is telling that many of Sidgwick’s\nmost notable admirers, such as Larmore (2008) and Parfit (2011), do\nnot carry all the baggage of his epistemological intuitionism but\nprefer instead to translate his arguments into the idiom of normative\n“reasons.” Indeed, Parfit called his deeply Sidgwickian\nview a form of non-naturalistic, non-metaphysical moral rationalism.\nAnd in another major recent work on the Methods, Phillips\n(2011) reconstructs Sidgwick’s arguments in a similar, Parfitian\nway, while retaining more of Sidgwick’s terminology. Thus, in\none vocabulary or another, these controversies are likely to continue\nas long as there is such a thing as ethical philosophy. \nThe point is worth illustrating in more detail, given the importance\nof recent work in this area. Thus, unlike Sidgwick, but like Phillips\n(2011), Parfit does not regard practical reason as teetering on chaos\nor think it a cosmic calamity if we cannot demonstrate that we always\nhave most reason to do what would be impartially best. He is content\nwith the effort to sort out the complex of reasons that we might have,\nwithout going so far as to worry about the absurdity of a universe in\nwhich Own Good and Other Good might be left in conflict, and he even\npronounces Sidgwick’s “somber claims” on this score\n“overstatements,” and the result of an unhelpful\n“two standpoints” framework of self and other that\nimplausibly casts self-interested and impartial reasons as wholly\nincompatible. Moreover, according to Parfit, Sidgwick drew the\nconflict too narrowly, between impartial and egoistic reasons, when in\nfact we might have personal and partial, but not self-interested\nreasons to act wrongly – or to care about the well-being of\nothers – and impartial reasons to act wrongly. Parfit, while\nallowing that we have “sufficient reasons” for acting\nmorally, also urges that Sidgwick’s more plausible claim is\nsimply: “When one of our two possible acts would make things go\nin some way that would be impartially better, but the other act would\nmake things go better either for ourselves or for those to whom we\nhave close ties, we often have sufficient reasons to act in either of\nthese two ways” (Parfit 2011, vol. 1: 137). And the substantive\nethical theory that Parfit sketches, the Triple Theory, represents a\nconvergence of rule consequentialism, Kantian universalizability, and\nScanlonian contractualism, and is thus at some distance from\nSidgwick’s form of utilitarianism (though Parfit himself is far\nfrom clear on the assessment of act utilitarianism). \nHowever, the recent work by de Lazari-Radek and Singer (2012, 2014,\n2016) has opened up some ingenious new lines of argument in this area,\narguments that, it is claimed, are more thoroughly Sidgwickian. As\nnoted, Sidgwick had argued that apparently self-evident claims had to\nbe clear and precise, able to withstand critical reflection,\nconsistent with one another, and able to win a consensus of experts,\nthough in other writings he collapsed the first two into just one\ncondition. De Lazari-Radek and Singer seem less concerned to reject\nany element of Sidgwick’s account than to add to it, such that\nthe significance of evolutionary “debunking” arguments is\nrecognized, and this leads them to reject Sidgwick’s\nDualism: \nThus, if, with Sharon Street (2006), one holds that in many cases\n“it is more scientifically plausible to explain human evaluative\nattitudes as having evolved because they help us to survive and to\nhave surviving offspring, than because they are true” (de\nLazari-Radek & Singer 2014: 180), one can debunk many of the\nbeliefs competing with the Axiom of Universal Benevolence, such as\nthose purportedly justifying partial or personal reasons for action.\nIf Benevolence is not debunked, and if it can in fact be accounted for\nstraightforwardly as a result of reason coming as a unity or package,\nsuch that either “we have a capacity to reason that includes the\ncapacity to do advanced physics and mathematics and to grasp objective\nmoral truths, or we have a much more limited capacity to reason that\nlacks not only these abilities, but others that confer an overriding\nevolutionary advantage. If reason is a unity of this kind, having the\npackage would have been more conducive to survival and reproductions\nthan not having it.” (de Lazari-Radek and Singer: 183). \nThat Singer, in particular, should in this way have developed\ndefenses, not only of Sidgwickian hedonism, but also of Sidgwickian\nmetaethical cognitivism (against his former commitment to Hare’s\nprescriptivism), and used these to advance a form of utilitarianism\nthat, he holds, is more consistently utilitarian than Sidgwick’s\nown position and in that way in line with Sidgwick’s deeper\ntendencies, is illustrative of the increasingly important role that\nSidgwick’s work is playing in cutting edge ethical theory.\nWhether the principle of Universal Benevolence really has the ability\nto withstand evolutionary debunking arguments, and whether such\narguments can really be made compelling in the first place, are open\nquestions, as is the question of whether Sidgwick himself would not\nhave found such gambits too narrow and unable to address his deeper\nworries about the religious significance of the dualism of practical\nreason (Schultz 2004, 2014, 2017; and Gray 2015). But even so, these\nrecent developments amount to something of a Sidgwickian\ncounter-revolution to the Rawlsian Kantian revolution, an effort at\nboth the meta and substantive ethical levels to provide an effective\nintuitionist and consequentialist alternative to Kantian\nconstructivist and proceeduralist accounts of moral reasons. \nAlthough Sidgwick denied that it was his special purpose, in the\nMethods, to call attention to the dualism of practical\nreason, this problem clearly loomed very large for him and affected\nmany other aspects of his life and work, including his views on the\nhistory of ethics: he thought egoism the dominant view of the\nclassical Greek philosophers, the difference between ancients and\nmoderns having largely to do with the modern preoccupation with\n“ought” rather than “good” and the emergence\nof the dualism in Butler (Frankena 1992; Irwin 1992, 1994, 2011).\nAgain, arguably, he never did full justice to non-hedonistic,\nteleological forms of perfectionism (Hurka 2001, 2011, and 2014a;\nCrisp 2015) or to fully deontological, Kantian views (Schneewind 1977,\nand Korsgaard 2009). However, as the remarks above underscore, the\nrange of his arguments is richer and more fertile than many of his\ncritics have recognized. Indeed, in his own day, he advanced effective\ncriticisms of the evolutionism of Herbert Spencer, the idealism of\nGreen and Bradley, and most of the other currents of philosophical\nopinion that he encountered. Weinstein (2000) argues effectively that\non key points Spencer and Sidgwick had much in common; Brink (2003)\nindicates just how intelligent and penetrating the exchanges between\nSidgwick and Green were, though he concludes that Green scored an\neffective point in charging that Sidgwick’s hedonism was\nimplausible, even if coherent, a point that the recent hedonists are\nof course not willing to concede (de Lazari-Radek & Singer 2014,\n2016). \nIn the end, however, at least on the topic of classifying\nSidgwick’s Methods as a work of classical\nutilitarianism, it remains difficult to dissent from\nSchneewind’s summary of its heterodoxy: the Methods \nThis helps explain why the work continues to inspire both utilitarians\nand their critics. \nIn an intriguing piece of retrospection written in 1887, Sidgwick\nexplained:  \nWhether Sidgwick’s memory was entirely accurate is uncertain. In\na letter actually composed in 1870, he confessed to his friend Roden\nNoel: \nWhat I really base it on (apart from the evidence supplied by\nSpiritualism, and apart from religious grounds) is on Ethics,\nas Kant, supported by Common Sense. But I do not state the argument\nquite as you answer it, but thus \nIn the face of the conflict between Virtue & Happiness, my own\nvoluntary life, and that of every other man constituted like me, i.e.\nI believe, of every normal man, is reduced to hopeless anarchy. \nTwo authorities roughly speaking Butler’s\n‘self-love’ and ‘Conscience’ claim to rule,\nand neither will yield to the other. \nThe only way of avoiding this intolerable anarchy is by the Postulate\nof Immortality. But you may say—‘you cannot believe it\nbecause you want to’ \nI reply; I find \nAt any rate, he often expressed dissatisfaction with the Kantian\nsolution, devoting endless hours to “the serious search for\nempirical evidence” of personal survival. He had long been\nsympathetic to this type of natural theology, devoting more effort to\nit than to exploring alternative epistemological arguments of\nrelevance to the dualism. Indeed, Sidgwick joined the Cambridge\n“Ghost Society” as an undergraduate, and he had already\ndevoted many years to informal psychical research before the formation\nof the Society for Psychical Research, in 1882, although his efforts\nexpanded thanks to the larger formal organization (Gauld 1968, and\nOppenheim, 1985). He was president of the SPR from 1882–85 and\nagain from 1888–93. The comparative sobriety of his leadership\nof this organization, which represented an unusual combination of\neminent intellectuals, first-rate scientists, and spiritualistic\nlunatics, undoubtedly did a great deal to enhance its respectability\nand insure its longevity. Even many of the spiritualists, who were\nprecommitted to belief in disembodied human spirits, seances, and so\nforth, allowed that Sidgwick was as fair-minded as any non-mystic\ncould be. \nSidgwick’s parapsychology was clearly and admittedly an\nextension of his religious studies and as such relevant to the\nsolution of the dualism of practical reason. He did not successfully\nspell out the precise chain of argument leading from evidence for\nsurvival to a unified conception of practical reason, but the general\nTheistic idea of a “friendly Universe” enjoying a\nutilitarian moral government was obviously behind his efforts. Again,\nalthough he was not sure that he could rationally defend it, he was\nstrongly drawn to the Theistic view that there is a “Heart and\nMind” behind phenomena—a “Sovereign Will that orders\nall things rightly” (Sidgwick and Sidgwick, 1906:\n604)—and that the universe is ethically meaningful, even if the\nstorm and stress that he had suffered in the 1860s had permanently\ndistanced him from Christian orthodoxy. Interestingly, his conversion\nto a more utilitarian mode of ethical theory had even predated his\nbreak with Anglican orthodoxy, which involved a long and painful\nstruggle that had him studying Hebrew and German, engaging with the\nnew biblical criticism of Strauss and Renan, and arguing with some of\nthe most prominent theologians of his day, including Benson (Schultz\n2017). He found, however, that historical and philological study of\nthe Bible could not answer the deepest philosophical and ethical\nquestions, which called for, among other things, free and open inquiry\ninto the possibility of miracles and paranormal phenomena.\nUnfortunately, he found that orthodox religion was all too often\nunreceptive to such forms of inquiry, and that his doubts about such\nmatters as the Virgin Birth were not adequately addressed by the\ntheologians. In a revealing public letter to the Times,\nSidgwick distinguished three different approaches to the Bible:\n“Simple Scripturalism,” which took it all as literally\ntrue, “Historical Scripturalism,” which took only its\ntheological and moral statements has having that standing, and\n“Rationalism,” which held that, although the “most\nimportant part of religious truth … was discovered or revealed\nbefore the first century of Christianity was closed,”\nnonetheless “the process of development which the historical\nscripturalist traces between the earlier and later of them has\ncontinued since, and will continue, and that we cannot forecast its\nlimits, and that even where the doctrine of the Bible, taken as a\nwhole, is clear, an appeal lies always open to the common sense,\ncommon reason, and combined experience of the religious portion of\nmankind” (quoted in Schultz 2004: 83). Sidgwick identified\nhimself with the Rationalist camp, which was congenial to developing a\nthin Theistic account of religion emphasizing the moral government of\nthe universe, personal survival of physical death, and the existence\nof a benevolent God. Indeed, he is confident “that the thought\nof civilised Europe is moving rapidly in its direction, and that it\nmust inevitably spread and prevail,” though he also hopes\n“that it may spread with the least possible disruption and\ndisorganization of existing institutions, the least possible\ndisruption of old sympathies and associations.” He is also\nconfident, as he makes plain in various works, that the day of\ntheological censure and authoritarianism is passing. \nSidgwick’s psychical research never yielded the hard proof of\nsurvival that he sought, and although at the end of his life he\nconcluded that it had been largely a waste of time, he allowed that\nthere were some positive results from it and that, at least in the\n1890s, some promising new lines of research had emerged. The\ninvestigation of personal survival turned out to be bound up with the\ninvestigation of many other purportedly paranormal phenomena:\ntelepathy, telekinesis, hypnotism, automatic writing, trance\nmediumship, apparitions of the living as well as the dead, the claims\nof Theosophy, etc. After all, it was argued, a medium supposedly\nrelaying information from the dead might instead be in telepathic\ncommunication with living sources of that information. Thus, in order\nto establish that communication from the “other world” had\nactually occurred, it was essential to be able to rule out the\npossibility of telepathy (Gauld 1968, 2007). \nThe “Sidgwick Group,” as it was called—that is,\nHenry and Eleanor Sidgwick, Arthur and Gerald Balfour, F. W. H. Myers,\nLord Rayleigh, Edmund Gurney, Frank Podmore, and a few\nothers—worked in close collaboration, and ended up establishing\nto their satisfaction the reality of telepathic communication among\nthe living, the findings being presented in the series of massive (and\nquite sophisticated) studies Phantasms of the Dead, Phantasms of\nthe Living, and the Census of Hallucinations. As Myers\nexplained the work: \nTo such transmissions of thoughts or feelings we have elsewhere given\nthe name of telepathy; and the records of an experimental\nproof of the reality of telepathy will form a part of the present\nwork. But … we have included among telepathic phenomena a vast\nclass of cases which seem at first sight to involve something widely\ndifferent from a mere transference of thought. \nI refer to apparitions; excluding, indeed, the alleged\napparitions of the dead, but including the apparitions of all\npersons who are still living, as we know life, though they may be on\nthe very brink and border of physical dissolution. And these\napparitions … are themselves extremely various in character;\nincluding not visual phenomena alone, but auditory, tactile, or even\npurely ideational and emotional impressions. All these we have\nincluded under the term phantasm; a word which, though\netymologically a mere variant of phantom, has been less often\nused, and has not become so closely identified with visual\nimpressions alone. (Myers [1886], 1975: ix). \nPsychical research, Myers goes on to suggest, can now claim “a\ncertain amount of actual achievement.” Thus, \nThus far the authors of this book, and also the main group of their\nfellow-workers, are substantially agreed. (Myers [1886], 1975:\nxx). \nThis last line indicates, in particular, that Henry Sidgwick, whose\nname did not appear among the list of authors of these works, was in\nsubstantial agreement with their claims, which certainly appears to be\nthe case. As Broad, a later sympathizer, summarized one of the main\nconclusions of the most comprehensive of the studies, the Census\nof Hallucinations: “About one visual hallucination in\nsixty-three occurs within a period of twenty-four hours round\nabout the death of the person whose apparition has been\n‘seen.’ If such deal-coincidences were purely fortuitous\nconcurrences of causally independent events the proportion would be\nabout one in nineteen thousand.” Broad concluded that\nthe Census was “a uniquely and meticulously careful\ncontribution to an important branch of their subject.” (Broad\n1938: 144) \nBut these studies suggested that much of the supposed evidence for\npersonal survival was merely evidence for telepathic communications\nfrom the living (albeit, perhaps dying), and Sidgwick consequently\nfound much of this work distressing rather than encouraging. It was\nonly in the 1890s, with the famous case of Leonora Piper, that he came\nto think that there was something resembling a “prima\nfacie” case for survival. Piper was an American whose trance\nmediumship produced purported communications from particular deceased\npersons, and her claims withstood the combined scrutiny of the best\nresearchers in both the American and British S.P.R.s, including\nWilliam James, the Sidgwicks, Richard Hodgson, and Frank Podmore. As\nBraude (2003) indicates, the Piper case is still being debated to this\nday (see also Berger 1987). Evidence of this nature helped persuade\nEleanor Sidgwick, in the years following Henry’s death, that his\npersonality had survived physical death and succeeded in communicating\nwith her (Schultz 2004, 2017). In an extremely curious, even bizarre,\nchapter of this history, Eleanor and her brothers, Arthur and Gerald,\nalong with various close friends and colleagues, apparently developed\na plot, supposedly with help from the “other side,” to\nbring about the birth of a “spirit child” who could become\na new Messiah, ushering in a reign of global peace (Roy 2008; Gray\n2011; Schultz 2017). What the actual, historical Henry might have\nmade of such an effort at applied esoteric morality is a very\nintriguing question.  \nIf much of Sidgwick’s psychical research today looks rather\ngullible, it must be allowed that his positive conclusions were always\nvery cautious and guarded, and that his work in fact had an\noverwhelmingly negative, destructive effect, akin to that of recent\ndebunkers of parapsychology. The Sidgwick Group exposed one fraud\nafter another, including the fraudulent claims of Madame Blavatsky and\nthe Theosophical movement, though Theosophists continue to dispute\nthis. Indeed, Theosophy remains an influential “New Age”\nform of the esoteric spiritualism that Sidgwick found attractive\n(given its concern with the common mystical core of all religions) but\nimpossible to defend (Oppenheim 1985). Insofar as parapsychology has\never enjoyed any standing as a rigorous field of scientific inquiry,\nthis is thanks to the efforts of Sidgwick. Furthermore, the work of\nthe Sidgwick Group helped pave the way for much of the developing\nresearch in depth psychology generally, calling attention to the\nefforts of Freud, Charcot, Richet and many others whose names are not\nprimarily associated with parapsychology (Gauld 1968, 2007). \nThus, Sidgwick’s parapsychological investigations were of\na-piece with his work on ethics and religion, and, especially in the\nlate 1880s, similarly frustrating. As he explained to his close friend\nSymonds, he had “tried all methods in turn—all\nthat I found pointed out by any of those who have gone before me; and\nall in turn have failed—revelational, rational, empirical\nmethods—there is no proof in any of them” (Sidgwick and\nSidgwick, 1906: 472). But Sidgwick was not eager to publicly proclaim\nthe negative results of his investigations, any more than he was eager\nto publicly proclaim the skepticism about orthodox religion with with\nwhich they were entangled. In the 1860s, in his work with the Free\nChristian Union and religious investigations generally, he had been\nmore open, freely identifying himself as a Rationalist and a skeptic.\nBut in the aftermath of his resignation, he ceased to attack openly\nthe religious beliefs and organizations that he deemed indefensible.\nAs he later explained to an old friend: \nCaught between the “Great Either-Or” of “Pessimism\nor Faith,” Sidgwick may have regarded his position as “an\ninevitable point in the process of thought,” but it was one he\ntook “as a soldier takes a post of difficulty,” and he\ncould not assume the responsibility of drawing others to it (Sidgwick\nand Sidgwick, 1906: 354). He was not sure that the subject of ethics\nwas sufficiently like science and unlike theology to render his\nacademic position legitimate, even if he did not have to swear belief\nin the Thirty-Nine Articles. But he did allow himself the hope that\n“a considerable improvement in average human beings in this\nrespect of sympathy is like to increase the mundane happiness for men\ngenerally, and to render the hope of future happiness less needed to\nsustain them in the trials of life” (Sidgwick and Sidgwick,\n1906: 358). Hence, the importance of political and educational reform.\nIt was “premature to despair.” Indeed, if Placido Bucolo,\nthe force behind an impressive series of conferences on Sidgwick\nhosted by the University of Catania, is correct, Sidgwick’s\nnon-despairing Theistic heart shone through his work and activities\nthroughout his life (Bucolo, Crisp, & Schultz 2007, 2011). But\nthere is still a great deal of research to do on this subject, on the\npolitics and sociology of parapsychology (see Warner 2006; Schultz\n2017), as well as the way in which Sidgwick distanced himself from\nKantian arguments for religious belief. Such research will likely\nprove more fruitful if it resists the temptation to treat\nthe Methods as a stand-alone work, with a narrow, textualist\ninterpretive approach that Sidgwick himself would have rejected\n(Schultz 2017, 2018) \nStill, perhaps the larger point of Sidgwick’s worries about the\ndualism and related issues is best captured by the gloss that, in the\nsecond edition of the Methods, he put on the dualism and its\npossible resolution by the appropriate Theistic premise: \nIt was, plausibly, this spectre of an unfriendly universe, of a\nperverse Cosmos and a fragmented self in which reason is schizophrenic\nor indeterminate, and the Wages of Virtue all too often dust, that\nmost deeply disturbed Sidgwick, even if he sometimes articulated the\nissue in drier philosophical terms. And any successful but more\nlimited defense of one side or another of the dualism may well have\nbeen, for him, only a very partial victory, a battle rather than the\nwar (Schultz 2004, 2012, 2017; Gray 2015). His deepest convictions\nwere more Tennysonian--the allusions to “wages” being to\nTennyson’s poem of that title, the last stanza of which\nreads: \nSidgwick may have thought that the “deepest problems” of\nhuman life had to do with the religious and ethical problems that\ninspired his parapsychological research, but he nonetheless also\ndevoted an enormous amount of time and energy to both the theoretical\nand practical sides of economics, politics, law, and ethics, which\nwere after all relevant to the problem of the dualism. In this he was\ncertainly in line with the tradition of Bentham and James and J. S.\nMill, all of whom presented utilitarianism as a comprehensive doctrine\nthat prioritized political, legal, and economic reform (Albee 1901;\nSkorupski 1993; and Rawls [1993], 1996, 2007). If Sidgwick had his\nown take on these subjects, his perspective was still that of a\ntheorist and reformer with broad “interdisciplinary”\nconcerns, rather than that of an ethicist obsessed with personal\nethics narrowly construed. His professional credentials as both an\neconomist and political scientist were impeccable, although the\nprofessional organizations now associated with these disciplines were\nonly beginning to take shape in his era. He was an active member of\nthe section of the British Association concerned with political\neconomy and economics, and his book on The Elements of\nPolitics, first published in 1891, became a staple of political\nscience at Cambridge and elsewhere. He is best thought of as one of\nthe founding fathers of the “Cambridge School” of\neconomics, one whose contributions should be classed with those of\nAlfred Marshall and A. C. Pigou (Backhouse 2006; Medema 2009; Cook\n2009; Winch 2009; and Cord 2017).  \nBut Sidgwick’s reputation as an economist has often suffered\nfrom an invidious comparison with Marshall, his Cambridge colleague\nand rival, who is classed among the greatest figures in the history of\nthe discipline. Marshall was both a brilliant economic thinker and a\nrelentless discipline builder, the man who basically established\nmodern economics as an independent academic discipline at Cambridge.\nAs “University politicians” he and Sidgwick were often at\nodds with each other, since Sidgwick on some points resisted his\nefforts, believing that economics should remain integrated with the\nstudy of politics. Almost immediately upon his appointment as\nprofessor in late 1884, Marshall, in a famous incident, confronted\nSidgwick and ridiculed him for his “mania” for\n“over-regulation” and his “failure to attract men on\na large scale,” the way Green had at Oxford. Marshall claimed\nthat Sidgwick was hampering his efforts, despite his greater knowledge\nof economics. Sidgwick reflected on the charges, but concluded that\nmissionary zeal was not for him: \nSidgwick had known Marshall for a long time—since the\n1860s—and had in fact helped his career. He had in effect\ntutored Marshall in philosophy, stimulated his interest in educational\nreform, fostered their mutual interest in political economy, and\nhelped call attention to the importance of Marshall’s early\nwork, privately circulating some of it. Initially, Marshall had joined\nin the cause of women’s higher education, but he later opposed\nit, despite his marriage to Newnham graduate Mary Paley. Thus, by the\n1880s and 90s, relations between the two men were often quite strained\n(Groenewegen 1995, and Schultz 2004). \nSidgwick had in fact long been a student of political economy.\n“Mill’s influence,” he explained, led him “as\na matter of duty” to “study political economy thoroughly,\nand give no little thought to practical questions, social and\npolitical” (Sidgwick and Sidgwick, 1906: 36). In the early\n1860s, he was absorbed in the study of Mill’s classic work, the\nPrinciples of Political Economy, and much influenced by\nMill’s Cambridge disciple, the blind political economist Henry\nFawcett. From the late 1870s on, he regularly published works in this\nfield, producing his own Principles of Political Economy in\n1883, heading the political economy section of the British\nAssociation, contributing to Palgrave, and serving on various\ngovernment Commissions concerned with economic questions (he developed\nconsiderable expertise devising intricate taxation schemes) His work\nas an academic and policy advisor put him in touch with (directly or\nindirectly) many of the leading economists of the day—not only\nsuch Cambridge colleagues as Fawcett, Marshall, J. N. Keynes, and\nHerbert Foxwell, but also such figures as Edgeworth, Leon Walras, N.\nSenior, J. E. Cairnes, and W. S. Jevons. He was even familiar with the\nwork of Karl Marx, at a time when few trained economists even knew who\nMarx was. Moreover, he was long involved with both the practical and\ntheoretical work of the Cambridge Charity Organization Society,\ndeveloping a sophisticated, eclectic approach to the issue of poor\nrelief. \nBut like Marshall and many economists down to the present, Sidgwick\ndrew a careful distinction between the descriptive side (the science)\nof economic analysis and the normative or policy side (the art), which\nespecially concerns the proper role of government intervention in the\nmarket system to improve “either the social production of wealth\nor its distribution” (Sidgwick 1901: 33). He was also steeped\nin the great methodological debates over the historical or inductive\nversus the analytic or deductive approaches to the subject, and his\nbalanced efforts to combine the two—and strengthen comparative\nstudies as well—considerably distance his work from older\nBenthamite defenses of Laissez Faire. For Sidgwick, “economic\nman” is simply an abstraction that may be useful for explaining\nor predicting some aspects of the behavior of people under certain\nhistorical circumstances and in certain situations. Both the science\nand art of economic analysis need to recognize the limitations of the\nassumption that people always act out of self-interest and happily so.\nIndeed, as he rather heatedly put it in his “The Scope and\nMethod of Economic Science”: \nSidgwick’s position certainly reflected the more sophisticated,\nmore historical, and even more socialistic views of the later J. S.\nMill, who had been influenced by both the Romantic movement and\nMacaulay’s withering criticisms of the apriorism of\nBenthamism—that is, of the Benthamite attempt to deduce the best\nform of law and government from the assumption of universal\nself-interest (Capaldi 2004). Sidgwick followed Mill in thinking that\npolitical economy needed to pay attention to the complexity and\nhistorical variety of human motivation and character, as well as the\ncondition of the working class. Perhaps characteristically, however,\nSidgwick appreciated the paradox involved in the successful\napplication of the historical method: \nThis is not to applaud the increasing individualism and\nself-interested behavior of the modern world, which in fact rather\nworried Sidgwick. Again like Mill, he hoped that the future would\nbring a growth in human sympathy and moral motivation. He even hoped\nthat individuals would come to be motivated to work by their concern\nto do their bit for the common good, to make their contribution to\nsociety; “ethical” socialism, though not necessarily\ngovernmental socialism, was for him a very attractive development. \nBut with respect to his contributions to the “science” of\neconomics, there has long been considerable controversy over how\nsuccessful Sidgwick was in going beyond Mill and appreciating the\n“marginalist revolution” going on around him. Deane argues\nthat “the Principles owed more to the classical\ntradition of J. S. Mill than to what contemporaries were then calling\nthe ‘new political economy’ of Jevons and Marshall”\n(Deane 1987: 329). And Howey, in an influential work, insists that\neconomists “must add something to and take something away from\nhedonism, as ordinarily construed, before it becomes marginal utility\neconomics. Jevons and Gossen could make the transformation; Sidgwick\nnever could” (Howey 1965: 95). On the other side, however,\nSidgwick’s economic work has been praised by more than one Nobel\nPrize winner, including George Stigler. Stigler, after remarking on\nhow the work of Cournot and Dupuit on monopoly and oligopoly\n“began to enter English economics, in particular though\nEdgeworth, Sidgwick, and Marshall,” confessed that he was\n“coming to admire Henry Sidgwick almost as much as the other\ntwo. His Principles … has two chapters (bk II, ch. IX\nand X) which are among the best in the history of microeconomics,\ndealing with the theories of human capital and noncompetitive\nbehavior” (Stigler 1982: 41). Elements of the Chicago School of\nEconomics, particularly of law and economics, have been intriguingly\ntraced back to Sidgwick by Steven Medema (2004), who has also\nhelpfully brought out the impact of Sidgwick’s religious\nconcerns on his economic approach (2008, 2009). Many of the\ncontributions to Cord (2017) clarify and highlight the role Sidgwick\nplayed in the development of economics, at Cambridge and in\ngeneral. \nFor his part, Sidgwick at least claimed that he was part of the new\nmovement, describing himself as a disciple of Jevons: “as Jevons\nhad admirably explained, the variations in the relative market values\nof different articles express and correspond to variations in the\ncomparative estimates formed by people in general, not of the\ntotal utilities of the amounts purchased of such articles,\nbut of their final utilities; the utilities, that is, of the\nlast portions purchased” (Sidgwick 1901: 82). But he did allow\nthat the differences with the older, Millian school had been\nexaggerated, and he continued, despite his considerable mathematical\nexpertise, to do economics in a qualitative mode. Even so, he showed\nconsiderable acumen in setting out and conceptually clarifying the\nfundamental concepts of economics (wealth, value, labor, money,\nefficiency, etc.), in bringing out the difficulties involved in\ncross-cultural and trans-historical comparisons of wealth, and in\nanalyzing the various cases of market failure, from monopoly to\ncollective action problems to negative externalities. Indeed, his\naccounts of market failure and the possible remedies—the\n“art” of political economy—have received somewhat\nmore recognition. Even Marshall praised this side of Sidgwick’s\nwork, calling the relevant section of the Principles the best\nthing of its kind “in any language” (Pigou 1925). It is\nwidely admitted that Marshall’s hand-picked successor at\nCambridge, A. C. Pigou, produced a form of welfare economics that\nlargely recapitulated Sidgwick’s contributions (Backhouse 2006;\nMedema 2009; Cook 2009; Winch 2009; and Schultz 2017). \nThe form of Sidgwick’s Principles of Political Economy,\nwith its careful conceptual clarifications and distinction between\nnormative and descriptive arguments, and its successive qualifications\nto individualistic, free market accounts of both, would prove to be\ncharacteristic, figuring in many of his essays and in such works as\nThe Elements of Politics. As in the case of the\nMethods, the structure of these works has often made it\ndifficult to see precisely where Sidgwick comes down on many issues.\nTypically, he begins with a robust statement of the\n“individualistic principle,” as, for example, in the\nElements: \nThen, typically, he goes on to explain how any such principle reflects\nvarious psychological and sociological presuppositions—for\nexample, that sane adults are the best judges of their own\ninterests—and that these are only approximate generalizations\nand subject to crucial limitations. The psychological assumption that\n“every one can best take care of his own interest” and the\nsociological one that “the common welfare is best attained by\neach pursuing exclusively his own welfare and that of his family in a\nthoroughly alert and intelligent manner”—both essential to\nthe case for Laissez Faire—end up being very heavily qualified\nand subject to so many exceptions that it is scarcely evident what\nSidgwick means when he calls individualism “in the main\nsound.” The list of qualifications covers everything from\neducation, defense, child care, poor relief, public works, collective\nbargaining, environmental protections, and more. He stresses two cases\nthat, he urges, perspicuously point up the problems with the\nindividualistic principle: “the humane treatment of lunatics,\nand the prevention of cruelty to the inferior animals.” Such\nrestrictions do not aim at securing the freedom of the lunatics or the\nanimals, but are a “one-sided restraint of the freedom of action\nof men with a view to the greatest happiness of the aggregate of\nsentient beings.” An unfortunate—but alas,\nrevealing—note adds that the “protection of inferior races\nof men will be considered in a subsequent chapter” (Sidgwick\n1919: 141–42). \nThese qualifications and limitations then invariably involve a\ndiscussion of the case for socialism and/or communism, a subject that\nSidgwick addressed at length in many works. His main objection to\nsocialistic interference was the familiar one that too much of it\nwould lead to splendidly equal destitution, as the old line has it,\nand that for people as presently constituted economic incentives were\nneeded to spur them to produce. But again, he hoped that “human\nnature” would change, growing more sympathetic and more amenable\nto ethical socialism, leaving the door open to the possibility of\nlegitimating greater governmental interference with the market. \nThat is, as noted above, whatever his anxieties about economic\nsocialism, Sidgwick was openly enthusiastic about ethical socialism,\nthe possibility of humanity growing more altruistic and compassionate,\nregarding their labor as their contribution to the common good. He was\nunder no illusions whatsoever, not only about the market failing to\nreflect claims of desert or merit, but also about the limitations of\nthat abstraction, “economic man,” since historical and\ncultural or national context could dramatically alter the\npossibilities for moving beyond economic individualism, though again,\nin some areas this emphasis on “national character” lent\nitself to the racist and imperialistic tendencies of the British\nempire (Schultz 2004; Schultz 2005). It is remarkable that\nSidgwick’s drift toward racism may have been in significant part\nof result of his absorption in the work of Jevons, who held that a\n“man of lower race, a negro for instance, enjoys possession\nless, and loathes labour more; his exertions, therefore, soon\nstop” (Jevons 1871: 177). Such views on matters of race, which\nwere more extreme than Mill’s, would increasingly reverberate\nthrough late 19th-century political economy (Macmillan 1890), finding\nexpression in Sidgwick’s admirer Edgeworth, who would insist on\nhow “Capacity for pleasure is a property of evolution, an\nessential attribute of civilization,” with\n“civilization” being determined in part by race.\n(Edgeworth 1881 [2003: 78]). \nClearly, in his political theoretical work, Sidgwick admittedly simply\nassumed the utilitarian criterion as the normative bottom line, rather\nthan arguing for it against rational egoism. Unfortunately, as he also\nstressed in many different works, no one could confidently predict the\ndirection of civilization. Although in his more historical works,\nnotably The Development of European Polity, Sidgwick\nassembled evidence to suggest that a continued growth in federalism\nand large-scale state organizations was likely, it was a very\ncarefully hedged conclusion and cast against a broad critique of the\nsocial sciences. Much as he admired the sweep and ambition of such\npioneers of sociology as Spencer and Comte (whose emphasis on the\n“consensus of experts” was appropriated for his\nepistemological work), he regarded their “sciences” of the\nlaws of human development as absurdly over-blown, yielding wildly\ndifferent predictions about the future course of humanity. He\nsincerely hoped that a more cosmopolitan attitude would be the wave of\nthe future, and that the growth of international law and cooperation\nwould decrease the likelihood of war, but he could not convince\nhimself that social science—with the partial exception of\neconomics—was beyond its infancy when it came to predicting\nthings to come (Bryce & Sidgwick 1919, and Schultz 2004,\n2017). \nThus, although D. G. Ritchie famously charged that with Sidgwick\nutilitarianism had grown “tame and sleek” and lost its\nreforming zeal, others, notably F. A. Hayek, held that he had in\neffect paved the way for the “New Liberalism” and even\nFabian socialism that soon overtook British politics, legitimating a\nfar greater degree of state intervention (Schultz 2004). Woodrow\nWilson, the future president of the U. S., admired Sidgwick’s\nElements, but found the more abstract, analytic side of his\nwork oddly “colorless” and in need of historical content.\nThese debates continue (Collini 1992, 2001; Kloppenberg 1992; Jones\n2000; Bell 2007; and Winch 2009). At any rate, Sidgwick’s work\nin politics and political theory, like his work in economics, does\nreveal how far he was from Benthamism; he even criticized at length\nthe Austinian theory of sovereignty—which analyzed law in terms\nof authoritative command and habitual obedience—so dear to the\nBenthamites, in a critique that received high praise from the legal\nhistorian (and Sidgwick student) F. W. Maitland. \nStill, it must be allowed that Sidgwick’s political writings did\nnot achieve the inspiring tone of J. S. Mill, and that, for all of his\nindebtedness to On Liberty, Considerations on Representative\nGovernment etc., he tended to highlight rather different\nconcerns—concerns that often reflected his views on the dualism\nof practical reason. Like the later Mill, he harbored many suspicions\nabout the wisdom of democracy and championed the need for a cultural\n“clerisy” or vanguard of educated opinion, often sounding\na note not unlike that of Walter Lippmann in the twentieth century,\nstressing how an educated elite should benevolently shape public\nopinion. He much admired the work of his friend James Bryce, author of\nThe American Commonwealth, which pointed up both the vitality\nand the dangers of the U.S. political system. But he devoted\ncomparatively little effort to proclaiming the benefits of freedom of\nconscience and speech, was quite critical of Mill’s schemes for\nproportional representation, and worried at length about how “to\ncorrect the erroneous and short-sighted views of self-interest,\nrepresenting it as divergent from duty, which certainly appear to be\nwidely prevalent in the most advanced societies, at least among\nirreligious persons.” In fact, for the government to supply\nteachers of this view might even be “indirectly individualistic\nin its aim, since to diffuse the conviction that it is every\none’s interest to do what is right would obviously be a valuable\nprotection against mutual wrong,” though it would probably\ndetract from the credibility of such teachers if they were salaried\nemployees of the state (Sidgwick 1919: 213–14). The more\nsinister aspects of Sidgwick’s worries about what he termed the\n“lower classes” and the “lower races,” and the\nways in which his work (including his parapsychology) intertwined with\na variety of late Victorian imperialistic projects, including those of\nhis colleague Sir John Seeley and of his brother-in-law Arthur\nBalfour, have been brought out primarily by Schultz (2004, 2007, 2017)\nand Bell (2007, 2016). \nWhat Sidgwick’s political writings so effectively highlight,\nhowever, is the crucial role of education in his practical and\ntheoretical work. Insofar as his more academic research carried a\npractical political point, this concerned the need for expanding and\nimproving educational opportunities for all. Thus, his (highly\nMillian) feminism was focused on higher education for women and the\nfoundation of Newham College, and his many attempts to improve the\ncurriculum of Cambridge University (by including Bentham, modern\nliterature, physiology and other new subjects) were correlated with\nefforts to expand its audience and impact (Tullberg [1975], 1998, and\nSutherland 2007). And beyond formal educational institutions,\nSidgwick was simply indefatigable in promoting and participating in\ndiscussion societies, ever aiming at the elusive “consensus of\nexperts” that his epistemology called for. If, towards the end\nof his life, his participation in such vehicles as the “Ethical\nSocieties” reflected his despair over the possibility of\nachieving such a consensus on the “deepest problems,” and\ninstead involved an effort to set such problems aside in the hope of\nagreeing on the practical upshot of ethical questions (Sidgwick\n1898), this was scarcely his characteristic attitude (Skelton 2011).\nHis support for John Addington Symonds, one of the English followers\nof Walt Whitman and a pioneer of gay studies, is also suggestive of\nhow creative and wide-ranging his educational efforts could be\n(Schultz 2004). \nSidgwick’s views on education and culture have not received\nnearly as much attention as his ethical work. But they merit careful\nconsideration, given the way in which he resembled Mill and Dewey in\nbeing a true philosopher-educator (Schultz 2004, 2011, 2017).\nJudicious and balanced in his call for the inclusion of both older\nhumanistic and modern scientific elements in any form of education\nworthy of the name, his vision could inspire the later educational\nreformism of both Russell and Dewey, along with that of many others.\nAs he put it, in one of his most thoughtful essays, “The Pursuit\nof Culture”:","contact.mail":"rschultz@uchicago.edu","contact.domain":"uchicago.edu"}]
