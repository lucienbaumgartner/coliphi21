Paradoxes form a\nnatural object of philosophical investigation ever since the origins\nof rational thought; they have been invented as part of complex\narguments and as tools for refuting philosophical theses (think of the\ncelebrated paradoxes credited to Zeno of Elea, concerning motion, the\ncontinuum, the opposition between unity and plurality, or of the\narguments entangling the notions of truth and vagueness, credited to\nthe Megarian School, and Eubulides of Miletus). Paradoxes—termed\nas Insolubilia—form also a substantial part of logical\nand philosophical investigations during the Middle Ages.\n\n\nThis entry concentrates on the emergence of non-trivial logical themes\nand notions from the discussion on paradoxes from the beginning of the\n20th century until 1945, and attempts to assess their importance for\nthe development of contemporary logic. Paradoxes involving\n vagueness,\n knowledge,\n belief,\n and\n space and time\n are treated in separate entries.\n\n\nA terminological warning is in order. The word “antinomy”\nis used below as alternative to, and synonymous with,\n“paradox”. Most paradoxes—but not all—involve\ncontradictions; for such cases, we often use the word\n“contradiction” as well.\n\nBetween the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th\ncentury, the foundations of logic and mathematics were affected by the\ndiscovery of a number of difficulties—the so-called\nparadoxes—involving fundamental notions and basic methods of\ndefinition and inference, which were usually accepted as\nunproblematic. Since then paradoxes have acquired a new role in\ncontemporary logic: indeed, they have led to theorems (usually\nnegative results, such as unprovability and undecidability) and they\nare not simply confined to the realm of a sterile dialectic. Several\nbasic notions of logic, as it is presently taught, have reached their\npresent shape at the end of a process which has been often triggered\nby various attempts to solve paradoxes. This is especially true for\nthe notions of set and collection in general, for\nthe basic syntactical and semantical concepts of standard\nclassical logic (logical languages of a given order, the notion\nof satisfiability, definability). After the first forty years, the\nby-products of the paradoxes included axiomatizations of set theory, a\nsystematic development of type theory, the foundations of semantics, a\ntheory of formal systems (at least in nuce), besides the\nintroduction of the dichotomy predicative/impredicative which\nwas important for conceptual reasons, but also for the future of proof\ntheoretical methods. \nEarly work on paradoxes of particular importance pertained to the\nfollowing notions: \nSome of these contradictions are already treated as separate entries\nin this encyclopedia\n (liar paradox,\n Russell’s paradox); the emphasis here will be on the background problems,\ntheir mutual links and the interaction with foundational and\nphilosophical issues. \nThe earliest modern paradoxes concerned the notions of ordinal and\ncardinal number. Burali-Forti, a mathematician of Peano’s\nschool, attempted to prove that the ordinal numbers are not linearly\nordered. Assuming by contradiction that the class \\(\\mathbf{ON}\\) of\nall ordinals could be linearly ordered, he observed that then\n\\(\\mathbf{ON}\\) itself would be well-ordered and it would possess an\nordinal \\(\\Omega \\in \\mathbf{ON}\\). Thus \\(\\mathbf{ON}\\) would be\nsimilar (order-isomorphic) to a proper initial segment of itself, the\none determined by \\(\\Omega\\), contradicting a well-known theorem about\nwell-ordered sets. The result was published in 1897 and, though\nBurali-Forti’s original aim is impossible to achieve, his\nargument showed that the collection \\(\\mathbf{ON}\\) is problematic at\nbest (Moore-Garciadiego 1981). \nThe father of set theory, Cantor, had noticed similar difficulties\nalready in 1895 (as witnessed by Bernstein and by letters to Hilbert\nand Dedekind). Indeed, in a second letter to Dedekind of August 31,\n1899 Cantor pointed out another problem, involving the notion of the\ncardinal number and implying that one cannot consistently think of the\n“the set of all conceivable sets”, say \\(M\\). Were \\(M\\) a\ngenuine set, then it would possess a cardinal number \\(m\\), which\nwould be the maximum cardinal number. But one could also consider the\nset \\(\\wp(M)\\) of all subsets of \\(M\\), and by Cantor’s theorem\nthe cardinality of \\(\\wp(M)\\) ought to be strictly bigger than the\npurported maximum \\(m\\): contradiction. \nAs a consequence, Cantor suggested a crucial distinction—still\nregarded as “subjective”, i.e., mathematically not\nprecise, by Hilbert (as late as 1904, see van Heijenoort 1967, p.\n131)—between totalities that cannot be conceived as a whole (the\ninconsistent ones) and those which can be regarded as\ncompleted (fertige Menge). Roughly, the former is a\ncollection that cannot be an element of other collections, whereas the\nlatter is a small collection, which can be an element of other\ncollections (see also the entry on\n the early development of set theory).\n This corresponds to the distinction between classes and\nsets, later made precise and axiomatized in the\nclass-theoretic approach (von Neumann, Bernays, Gödel); it is\nreminiscent of the Russellian limitation-of-size doctrine (see\n 3.1\n below; Garciadiego 1992). \nIn the case of the difficulty discovered by Burali-Forti, the\nconsequence for Cantor was that the multiplicity\n(Mannigfaltigkeit) of ordinal numbers is itself well-ordered,\nbut is not a set: hence, no ordinal can be assigned to it, and the\nantinomy is resolved. \nThe second famous published antinomy (Russell 1903, paragraphs 78,\n101–106; Frege 1903, Appendix, dated October 1902; see the entry\n Russell’s paradox\n and Klement 2010) takes us from Cantor’s paradise into the\nrealm of the foundations of logic and the philosophy of mathematics.\nIt is strikingly simple, involves only predicate application, and it\nhas an explicit self-referential (reflexive) character. In\nRussell’s own words (June 16, 1902, letter to Frege, translation\nin van Heijenoort 1963, pp. 124–125), \nRussell was at first entangled in the study of “the\ncontradictions in the relation of continuous quantity to number and\nthe continuum” (cited in Moore 1995, p. 219), and he obtained\nhis contradiction (May 1901) as a result of considering the antinomy\narising with Cantor’s theorem (see Russell 1903, footnote 7,\npar. 344; par. 100, p. 101). Russell probably realized the importance\nof the discovery only after Frege’s reply. The effect of the\nantinomy is that it is impossible to have an abstraction operation\n\\(\\phi \\mapsto \\{x \\mid \\phi \\}\\) mapping injectively any concept\n(property) \\(\\phi\\) into its extension (the class of all \\(x\\) such\nthat \\(\\phi(x))\\) (i.e., so that if the classes defined by \\(\\phi\\)\nand \\(\\psi\\) are equal, then \\(\\phi(a)\\leftrightarrow \\psi(a)\\), for\nevery object \\(a)\\). As a consequence, it is also impossible to lay\nout the foundations of set theory on a pure logical notion of\nset where membership faithfully mirrors predicate application, in\nthe sense that, in the light of Frege, \\(x \\in y\\) means that (1) \\(y\n= \\{x \\mid \\phi(x)\\}\\) for some concept \\(\\phi\\), and (2) \\(\\phi\\)\ntruly applies to \\(x\\). (For historical details on Russell’s\ndiscovery of the paradox, see Moore 1995). \nRussell’s Principles of Mathematics (1903) contains\nextended discussions of Russell’s and Burali-Forti’s\nparadoxes in various forms in the sections 78, 84–85, 101, 301.\nRussell’s paradox is adapted to show that a propositional\nfunction \\(\\phi\\) cannot be a logical subject (i.e., as separated from\nits argument; it is not saturated in Frege’s terms);\notherwise, \\(\\phi\\) would apply to itself, \\(\\neg \\phi(\\phi)\\) would\nbe a propositional function and it would be possible to reproduce the\ninconsistency. \nIn ch. 10, section 102, Russell also gives a form of Cantor’s\ntheorem, which captures the logical essence of diagonalization (this\nversion is by now folklore): no binary relation can parameterize all\nunary predicates over a given domain \\(U\\) (i.e., no binary relation\n\\(R\\) exists such that for all unary predicates \\(P\\) over \\(U\\),\nthere is an object \\(a\\) in \\(U\\) for which one has: for all \\(x\\) in\n\\(U, R(a, x) \\leftrightarrow P(x))\\). \nIn sum, Russell’s contradiction shows the critical status of\napparently safe logical principles: either one has to give up the\nassumption that “any propositional function containing only one\nvariable is equivalent to asserting membership for a class defined by\nthe propositional function” (i.e., the comprehension principle);\nor one has to reject the idea that “every class can be taken as\none term” (pp. 102–103). \nIn Russell’s hands the paradox applies to predicates, classes,\nand propositional functions and leads to a new picture of the\nlogico-mathematical universe, which is outlined in a first exposition\nof the doctrine of types: to each propositional function \\(\\phi\\) is\nassociated a range of significance, i.e., a class of objects\nto which the given \\(\\phi\\) applies in order to produce a proposition;\nmoreover, precisely the ranges of significance form types. However,\nthere are objects that are not ranges of significance; these are just\natoms (i.e., urelemente or individuals) and they form the\nlowest type. The next type consists of classes or ranges of\nindividuals; then one has classes of classes of objects of the lowest\ntype, and so on (see also the entry on\n type theory).. \nNew difficulties still arise if one accepts that propositions form a\ntype (as they are the only objects of which it can be meaningfully\nasserted that they are true or false). First of all, there are\nobviously at least as many propositions as objects (just consider the\nmap associating with \\(x\\) the proposition expressed by \\((x = x)\\);\np. 527). On the other hand, if it is possible to form types of\npropositions, there are more types of propositions than propositions,\nby Cantor’s argument. Then we can inject types of propositions\ninto propositions by means of the notion of logical product.\nLet \\(m\\) be a class of propositions and let \\(\\Pi m\\) be the\nproposition “every proposition of \\(m\\) is true” (regarded\nas a possibly infinitary conjunction); then, if \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are\ndifferent classes, the propositions \\(\\Pi m\\) and \\(\\Pi n\\) are\ndifferent, i.e., the map associating to \\(m\\) its product \\(\\Pi m\\) is\ninjective. Therefore, if we consider the class \nwe have, by injectivity, a contradiction. \nOf course, if one were to adopt the extensional point of view, and\nhence identify equivalent propositions, the contradiction above could\nnot be derived. Russell, however, sticks to an intensional point of\nview, stressing that equivalent propositions often can be quite\ndifferent. So one is apparently forced to reject the assumption that\npropositions form one type, and hence to require that they\nought to have various types, while logical products ought to\nhave propositions of only one type as factors. \nThis was eventually the basis of the ramified theory of types, but in\n1903 Russell still regarded the suggestion as harsh and artificial. As\nthe footnote on p. 527 shows, he believed that the set of all\npropositions is a counterexample to Cantor’s theorem. \nZermelo independently discovered Russell’s paradox in\nGöttingen (as witnessed by Hilbert and Husserl) in the following\nform: a set \\(M\\) that comprises as elements all of its subsets is\ninconsistent. Indeed, consider the set \\(M_0\\) of all elements of\n\\(M\\) which are not elements of themselves (e.g., the empty set is in\n\\(M_0)\\). This set is a subset of \\(M\\) and hence by assumption on\n\\(M, M_0 \\in M\\). If \\(M_0 \\in M_0\\), then \\(M_0\\) is not a member of\nitself. Hence \\(M_0 \\not\\in M_0\\) and since \\(M_0 \\in M, M_0 \\in\nM_0\\): contradiction. \nIn addition, Hilbert had noticed in unpublished work (see Kahle and\nPeckhaus 2002) that additional contradictions of a mathematical nature\ncan arise. The first one derives from assuming that there is a\nwell-defined set \\(C\\) which satisfies the following closure\nconditions: (i) the set \\(N\\) of natural numbers is an element of\n\\(C\\); (ii) \\(X^X \\in C\\), whenever \\(X \\in C\\) (where \\(X^X\\) is the\nset of all functions from \\(X\\) to \\(X)\\); (iii) \\(\\cup X \\in C\\),\nwhenever \\(X \\subseteq C\\). Then by (iii), \\(\\cup C = U \\in C\\) and\nfinally \\(F = U^U \\in C\\). But by definition of union, \\(F \\subseteq\nU\\); hence there would exist a map of \\(U\\) onto \\(F\\) and a\ncontradiction could be derived by diagonalization. \nFurthermore, as is witnessed by Hilbert’s unpublished Sommer\nVorlesung 1905 (see Kahle 2004), Hilbert discovered a remarkable\nfunctional version of Russell’s paradox, later to become popular\nin the context of combinatory logic, lambda calculus and recursion\ntheory. The argument is based on functional self-application\nand hence direct self-reference. \nThe contradiction is obtained by assuming that the universe includes\neverything, i.e., variables range over both objects and functions, and\nthat there are at least two distinct objects. Then one introduces a\nnew operation (universal application in our sense): \\(xy\\) is the\nresult of applying \\(x\\) to \\(y\\). Given two distinct objects 0 and 1,\nand on the assumption that the universe is closed under arbitrary\ndefinition by cases, there exists an object \\(f\\) such that \\(fx =\n0\\), if \\(xx \\ne 0\\), and \\(fx = 1\\), if \\(xx = 0\\). Then one chooses\n\\(x = f\\) (as \\(x\\) ranges over everything) and easily derives a\ncontradiction. \nThe results of the Hilbert school were not published because\ncontradictions and paradoxes were regarded as symptoms of growth and\nas temporary difficulties. The diagnosis was that traditional logic is\ninsufficient and the theory of concept-formation needs to be\nsharpened. Any concept \\(C\\) is given in a network of concepts (letter\nof Hilbert to Frege, Dec. 27, 1899; see Frege 1976, pp. 79–80),\nand this network is determined by the axioms. Only the consistency of\nthe axioms that define the concept guarantees the legitimacy of \\(C\\).\nIn a nutshell: paradoxes tell us that we must develop a\nmetamathematical analysis of the notions of proof and of the axiomatic\nmethod; their importance is methodological as well as\nepistemological. \nAs the reactions of the mathematical world made clear, the paradoxes\nwere crucially involved around 1905 when basic problems of set theory\nwere worked on. Indeed, the new contradictions not only affected the\nconception of set and logical concepts, they also came to include the\nnotion of definability and its relation with a fundamental\nissue: the structure of the mathematical continuum and in particular\nwhether the continuum can be well-ordered and whether Cantor’s\nContinuum Hypothesis (CH) holds. \nAt the Heidelberg Congress in 1904, Julius König tried to refute\nCantor’s continuum hypothesis. Due to a mistake discovered by\nZermelo, his paper was immediately withdrawn, but the subsequent year,\nKönig produced a new argument. \nConsider the reals which are definable in finitely many\nwords. They form a countable sequence: \\(E_0, \\ldots,\nE_n,\\ldots\\). Since the continuum is uncountable, there exist reals\nnot occurring in the given enumeration. Assuming that the continuum is\nwell-ordered, there exists “the least real \\(E\\) which is not in\nthe sequence \\(\\{E_n \\mid n \\in \\Omega \\}\\)”; this real is not\nin the sequence, but the very expression “the least real \\(E\\)\nwhich is not in the sequence” defines \\(E\\) with finitely\nmany words; so \\(E\\) occurs somewhere in the sequence:\ncontradiction! \nKönig also observed that the argument extends to the second\nnumber class and a similar paradox could be obtained by considering\nthe collection \\(\\mathbf{FOD}\\) of finitely definable countable\nordinals. In this case, taking inspiration from Cantor,\nKönig’s solution is that Cantor’s second number class\nis not a set in a proper sense (a completed totality). To define a\nset, according to König, one should provide not only a rule for\ndefining its elements, but also a means for distinguishing them. \nA contradiction related to König’s had been published\nslightly earlier by Jules Richard, a mathematician of a Lyceé\nin Dijon. Using an enumeration of all permutations with repetitions of\nthe twenty-six letters of the French alphabet, Richard noticed that\nthe set \\(E\\) of reals that can be defined by finitely many French\nwords is denumerable and hence one can assume to have an enumeration\n\\(u_1, u_2,\\ldots\\) of all those numbers. But then one can define the\nfollowing real \\(N\\): the integer part of \\(N\\) is 0, while its\n\\(n\\)th decimal digit of \\(N\\) is \\(p+1\\) if \\(u_n\\) has the \\(n\\)th\ndecimal digit \\(p\\) different from both 8 and 9; otherwise, the\n\\(n\\)th decimal digit of \\(N\\) is 1. By construction, \\(N\\) will not\noccur in \\(u_1, u_2,\\ldots\\). On the other hand, if we consider that\n\\(N\\) is defined by means of a finite collection of letters, this must\noccur in \\(u_1, u_2,\\ldots\\). \nContrary to König, Richard did not rely upon the well-ordering of\nthe continuum, and the proposed solution is interesting for the\nfoundational debate to come. He pointed out that the definition of the\nnumber \\(N\\) refers to the totality of definable reals, to which \\(N\\)\nitself belong; but no object should be definable in terms of a\ncollection containing it. So it appears that the definition is\nviciously circular, and that makes the definition illusory. This idea\nsoon became the basis of Poincaré’s solution, and\neventually also Russell’s (see below\n 3.1,\n the issue of impredicatively defined collections). \nSo, why definability? The motivation was made clear for instance by\nBernstein’s “Die Theorie der reellen Zahlen”\n(1905a), where Cantor’s continuum hypothesis was claimed to be\nsettled in the positive. He criticized the so called “Dirichlet\nnotion” of arbitrary function and stated that it is possible to\ngive a foundation to the continuum using only computable reals, i.e.,\nreals possessing an explicit “formation law”\n(“Bildungsgesetz”). \nAccording to him, this is not a restriction since—he\nclaims—there are nondenumerably many computable reals in his\nsense. He also states that it is possible to display the new\ncomputable continuum in a hierarchy (i.e., a \\(\\subset\\)-increasing\nsequence) \\(\\{B_{\\alpha} \\mid \\alpha \\lt \\aleph_1\\}\\) of subsets of\n\\(N^N\\), which is defined in such a way that each \\(B_{\\alpha}\\) is at\nmost of cardinality \\(\\aleph_1\\) and hence that the cardinality of the\nunion of the sequence is at most \\(\\aleph_1\\). The idea is to start\nwith a basic domain \\(B_0 \\subset N^N\\) of simple functions (e.g.,\nthose having finitely many values), then to define a new domain\n\\(B_1\\) which extends \\(B_0\\) with operations that are defined from\nelements of \\(B_0\\), and so on. \nThough his claims are not justified, in the light of\nGödel’s later work on constructibility, one might say that\nBernstein’s basic intuition was sound: the continuum problem can\nbe settled, if one has an appropriately general notion of definability\n(or computability, constructibility) and by iterating it along the\nordinals. \nThis question was ultimately connected with the problem of\nunderstanding the atomistic continuum. The arithmetized\nconception—in the sense of Dedekind or Cantor, where real\nnumbers are identified with suitable sets of rationals—shifted\nthe attention towards arbitrary infinite sequences of natural\nnumbers. But this notion was not so easy to accept. According to\nBernstein (Bernstein 1905a, p. 449), an infinite sequence (or an\ninfinite set) must be given by a genuine rule. But what is a\nrule? Since one must be liberal (in order not to have just\nspecial classes of reals, if one is too restrictive), one is naturally\ndriven to think of arbitrary finitely described laws, shifting the\nattention towards the syntax of the rules. However, unless\none considers ordinary language, no such syntax is available and this\nengenders indeterminacy (this is Peano’s diagnosis, see below\nPeano 1902–1906). \nThe need for a specification of infinite sets is crucial in the\ndiscussion of the related well-ordering problem. It also affects the\nrelated issue of the classification of discontinuous functions and\nanalytically representable functions of real variables, tackled by the\nFrench semi-intuitionists Borel, Baire and Lebesgue. At the same time,\nthey held the view that a mathematical entity (like an infinite set or\na function) exists only insofar as it is “nameable by a finite\nnumber of words”, against the platonistic views of Hadamard and\nZermelo (see Borel et al. 1905). \nIn the light of the foundational debate, the following years were rich\nin seminal work: new paradoxes were discovered (Berry,\nGrelling-Nelson), an old paradox—the Liar—showed up again,\na comprehensive view of the contradictions of logic and mathematics\nwas masterfully outlined in the opening section of Russell’s\n1908 paper and the preceding Russell 1906a, while a conceptual\ndistinction between two kinds of paradoxes was set forth in\nPeano’s paper of 1906. Also, the basic ideas of predicativity\nemerged in the discussion between Poincaré, the leading\nmathematician of the time, and Russell. Even more important for the\nhistory of mathematical logic, fundamental technical advances for\nsolving the paradoxes and shaping the foundations of logic and\nmathematics were made: Russell’s theory of (ramified) types and\nZermelo’s axiomatization of set theory. \nRussell’s and Poincaré’s ideas for solving\nparadoxes are to be found in a number of papers published in the\nperiod 1905–1912: \nPoincaré (1906b) took the contradictions as grounds to defend\nan intuitionistic, Kantian point of view. According to him,\nnumber-theoretic induction and the axiom of choice constitute\nindependent intuitions, truly synthetic a priori judgements. He then\nargues against Russell’s logical definition of natural numbers\nas those numbers which belong to all recurrent classes (those\nclasses which contain 0 and are closed under successor). His objection\nis that the definition is not admissible since it refers essentially\nto a totality to which the class to be defined belongs—the\ndefinition is impredicative—and hence it is to be\nregarded as circular. But, according to Poincaré,\nmathematical objects do not exist without a proper\ndefinition, and a proper definition must be predicative,\ni.e., it must avoid vicious circles; Poincaré thus\nsomewhat extended Richard’s diagnosis. \nPoincaré’s views evolved over the years and in the debate\nwith Russell. In the later period, he advanced a novel approach to\npredicativity, which, though informally sketched, is suggestive of\nlater developments in definability and proof theory (see Feferman\n1964, Heinzmann 1985). He no longer insisted on the vicious\ncircularity of the definition involved in the contradictions; instead,\nhe held the view that a predicative classification is\ncharacterized by invariance, i.e., that it cannot be affected by\nthe introduction of new elements; by contrast, impredicative notions\nare subject to constant modification whenever new elements are\nintroduced. \nIn the light of contemporary logic, Poincaré is hinting at some\nform of absoluteness or invariance under extension (that will\nbe made precise by Kreisel 1960 via model theory and recursion\ntheory): his ideas will inspire the non-ramified approach to the\nfoundations of predicative analysis. \nIn his last contribution to Acta Mathematica (1909) and in\nhis fifth Göttingen lecture (1910), he also gave a restatement of\nRichard’s paradox, as a refinement of Cantor’s theorem, in\nthe form: “there is no definable enumeration of definable\nreals”. \nWhile mathematicians and Poincaré himself focused on the\nproblems raised by the contradictions insofar as they involved the\nfoundations of specific mathematical notions (the continuum, the\nnatural numbers, the theory of cardinal and ordinal numbers), Russell\ndirectly attacked the comprehension principle, that is, the\nassumption that certain propositional functions determine a class (see\nalso\n 2.3\n above). The paradoxes prove that a propositional function may be\nwell-defined for every argument, and yet the collection of the values\nfor which it is defined need not be a class. So the crucial\nproblem becomes logical: to give a criterion for selecting those\npropositional functions which give rise to classes (understood as\nwell-defined objects). \nUnder the influence of Poincaré, Russell (1906, p. 634)\naccepted the vicious circle principle, for which he used a\nformulation in the terminology and adopting the notions of formal\nlogic as formulated by Peano: \nIn logical terms, we are not allowed to quantify over a given class\n\\(X\\) when defining an element of \\(X\\) itself (see also the entry on\n definitions). \nOf course, the vicious circle principle is not itself a theory, but a\ncondition any adequate theory has to satisfy. Russell (1906, 1907)\ntentatively proposed three alternative approaches: the zigzag theory,\nthe theory of limitation of size, and the no-classes theory. The\nzigzag theory attempts to capture the idea that the right functions\nought to be ‘simple’, while according to the second view,\n‘predicative’ would be characterized by a certain\nlimitation of the size of classes which can be predicatively defined\n(e.g., the collection of all ordinals \\(\\mathbf{ON}\\) is too large).\nIn the no-classes theory, classes are not independent entities and\nanything said about them is to be regarded as an abbreviation of a\nstatement about their members and the propositional functions defining\nthem. This is not far from Poincaré’s idea that\nmathematical objects should be specified in finitely many words.\nHowever, Russell developed his own technical devices—such as the\n‘substitution method’ (Landini 1998), and the contextual\nelimination of definite descriptions (see the entry\n Russell)\n – in order to implement his ideas. \nIn contrast to Poincaré, Russell 1906 did not consider the\nactual infinite as an essential component of the foundational malaise,\nand he stressed that contradictions arise even if the infinite is not\ninvolved. This is clearly shown by the Liar paradox in the form\n‘I am lying’. As far as we know, it is exactly at this\npoint in time that the (probably) most cited semantical puzzle in the\nhistory of logic regains a conspicuous position in logical\nanalysis. \nIn his analysis of the Liar paradox, Russell assumed that there exists\na true entity—the proposition—that is presupposed by a\ngenuine statement (e.g., when I say that Socrates is mortal, there is\na fact corresponding to my assertion and it is this fact that is\ncalled ‘proposition’). The same holds if the statement is\nfalse, but not in the case where the statement itself contains\nquantified variables. \nThe paradox is then solved by construing the Liar as ‘there is a\nproposition that I state and that is false’; hence the statement\ncontains a quantification (hence an apparent variable) over the\ncollection of all propositions, and it is not a proposition in a\nproper sense (Russell 1906, 642–644). So the conclusion is that\nthe Liar is false because it does not state a proposition. \nSimilar considerations apply to the paradox suggested by\nBerry, which is briefly stated in Russell 1906 for the first time\nin published form, and has the merit of not going beyond the domain of\nfinite numbers. \nConsider the natural numbers that are definable by means of less than\n18 syllables: this set is non-empty and finite. So there exist numbers\nwhich are not definable using less than 18 syllables. Consider the\nleast such number: clearly, by definition, it is not definable with\nless than 18 syllables. \nOn the other hand such a number is definable with less than 18\nsyllables, since it is uniquely determined by the expression\n“the least number not definable with less than 18\nsyllables”, which itself has less than 18 syllables. \nFor the sake of historical accuracy, we should remark that Beppo Levi,\nwho made an articulated contribution to the debate on the axiom of\nchoice in the first two decades of the 1900s, outlined an antinomy\nwhich is essentially a variant of Berry’s paradox in the context\nof discussing Richard’s paradox (see Levi 1908, and also Lolli\n2007 and Bruni 2013 for further comments about Levi’s approach\nto paradoxes). \nThe Russellian theory of types is widely known and investigated in the\nliterature (see the entries on\n type theory\n and\n Bertrand Russell):\n it is of current interest and has descendants in logic and its\napplications. It was first developed by Russell in the fundamental\nmemoir Mathematical Logic as based on the theory of types of\n1908. \nThe doctrine of types is based upon the observation that universal\nquantification—understood as full generality, i.e., when \\(x\\)\nranges ‘over the whole universe’—does not make\nsense: when we state that \\(\\forall x\\phi(x)\\) is true, we only claim\nthe function \\(\\phi(x)\\) has the value ‘true’ for all\narguments \\(x\\) for which it is meaningful. The essential\npoint is that each propositional function has a range of significance,\ni.e., a type, and quantification is legitimate only over\ntypes. Formally speaking, each variable must have a preassigned\ntype. The paradoxes (or reflexive fallacies) prove that certain\ncollections, such as the totality of all propositions, of all classes\nand so on, cannot be types. So we can quantify over the collection of\nmen, but we cannot properly state ‘all propositions of the form\n\\(p\\vee \\neg p\\) are true’. Therefore, the logical entities\ndivide into types, and, in particular, every propositional\nfunction must have a higher type than its arguments. Moreover, in\nthe light of the vicious circle principle, the notion of\norder must also be introduced. No object can be defined by\nquantifying over a totality which contains the object itself as\nelement; hence the order of every propositional function must be\ngreater than the order of propositional functions over which it\nquantifies. \nThe main idea is clarified in Russell 1908 (pp. 163–164) by\nconsidering how propositions can be arranged into a suitable\n“ramified” hierarchy, according to their order and so as\nto satisfy the vicious circle principle. First of all, there are\nelementary propositions, i.e., those containing no bound variables at\nall, while the lowest type consists of individuals.\nIndividuals are entities without logical structure and can be regarded\nas the subjects of elementary propositions. The second logical type\nembraces the first order propositions, i.e., those whose\nquantifiers (if any) range only over individuals. Quantification over\nfirst order propositions gives rise to a new type, consisting exactly\nof second order propositions. In general, the \\((n + 1)\\)th\nlogical type comprises propositions of order \\(n\\), which contain\nquantification only up to the \\((n – 1)\\)th order. \nSince a propositional function can be obtained from a proposition\n‘by treating one or more of its constituents as\nvariables’, the hierarchy of types and orders is naturally\nlifted to propositional functions, and it makes sense to speak of\norder of a function, its order being roughly the order of the\nvalue (i.e., a proposition) which the function assumes when it is\napplied to an argument for which it makes sense. So, for instance, a\nfunction which applies to individuals and takes first-order\npropositions as values is first-order. \nFollowing the doctrine of types, we must replace ‘all\npropositions’ by ‘all propositions of order \\(n\\)’\nfor a given \\(n\\). Hence the Liar sentence becomes “it is not\ntrue of all propositions \\(p\\) of order \\(n\\), that if I affirm \\(p,\np\\) is true”, which is a proposition of order \\(n + 1\\). Then\nthe Liar is simply false rather than contradictory; and this solves\nthe paradox. Similar arguments solve the other paradoxes. \nIn this theory, predicative functions of one argument, i.e.,\nthose having as order the successor of the order of their argument,\nplay a crucial role. For instance, a predicative function of an\nindividual variable must have order 1 (in current terminology, it is\nelementarily definable and quantifies only over individuals).\nThe axiom of reducibility (AR) states that every\npropositional function is equivalent, for all its values, to a\npredicative function of the same variables. So, for instance, we\nmight have a definition of a property \\(P(n)\\) of natural numbers\n(regarded as individuals) which quantifies over, say, second-order\npropositions. But AR implies that there exists a function \\(P^* (n)\\)\nwhich is satisfied by exactly the same numbers as \\(P(n)\\) and is\npredicative, i.e., it involves quantification only on\nnumbers. \nThus, according to the axiom of reducibility, statements about\narbitrary functions can be replaced by statements about predicative\nfunctions; and predicative functions play the role of classes, i.e.,\ncanonical representatives of arbitrary complex concepts (e.g., among\nthe possible properties of different order which have the same\nextension as \\(P(n)\\), \\(P^*(n)\\) canonically represents the class of\nnumbers satisfying \\(P(n))\\). \nBesides the axiom of infinity, AR is an essential tool for\nreconstructing classical mathematics, but it is a strong existential\nprinciple, apparently in conflict with the philosophical idea that\nlogical and mathematical entities are to be constructively generated\naccording to the vicious circle principle. Nonetheless, it was adopted\nin the (first edition of the) monumental Principia\nMathematica, written in collaboration with A.N. Whitehead and\npublished in 1910 (vol. 1), 1912 (vol. 2) and 1913 (vol. 3). \nInterestingly, the basic idea underlying Russell’s ramified\nhierarchy of types is a crucial ingredient in Gödel’s later\nconsistency proof of the continuum hypothesis via its inner model\n\\(L\\) of constructible sets. Also, as already observed in Gödel\n(1944), a form of AR becomes true in \\(L\\) in the sense that, roughly,\nan arbitrary propositional function of natural numbers is\nextensionally equivalent to some function of order \\(\\alpha\\), for\nsome countable ordinal \\(\\alpha\\) (see the entry\n Kurt Gödel).\n Other important applications of ramified hierarchies have been given\nsince the late fifties in different fields (from recursion theory to\nproof theory; see the entry on\n type theory). \nThere is a sizeable literature on paradoxes already in the early years\nof the 20th century, which is not at all exhausted by the\nprevious discussion. Refinements and variations of foundational and\nlogical interest are to be found in the works of several authors,\nincluding prominent mathematicians, among them Peano, Borel,\nSchönflies, Brouwer, and Weyl. Some of the more stimulating and\noriginal proposals are surveyed in the rest of this section. \nPeano’s criticism (in Additione a Super Theorema de\nCantor-Bernstein) of Richard’s paradox is mainly known\nbecause it points out that “Richard’s example pertains\nto linguistics, not to mathematics” and this statement\nopens up the distinction between set-theoretic or mathematical\nantinomies and semantical antinomies: the weak point in\nRichard’s definition is that to some extent it is symbolic and\nformal, but it also makes use of the natural language\n(“lingua commune”); this contains ideas that are\nquite familiar but nevertheless are not sharply defined and are\nambiguous (Peano 1906, p. 357–358). For instance, there is no\nprecise criterion for deciding whether a given expression of the\nnatural language represents a rule uniquely defining a number. \nIn spite of that, Peano elaborated a formal solution. He tried to get\nrid of vagueness and reference to \\(E\\), the set of finitely definable\nreals in the unit interval, by fixing an explicit\n“Gödel-numbering”: given a natural number \\(n\\),\nwrite \\(n\\) in base \\(B\\), for sufficiently large \\(B\\) (so as to\ninclude the number of alphabet letters plus punctuation marks). Then\neach number is assigned a finite string of symbols in the natural\nlanguage, and in certain cases the string will define a number,\n\\(\\Val(n) =\\) “the decimal number which is determined by the\nexpression encoded by \\(n\\) and interpreted according to the rules of\nthe natural language”. Now, in order to get the paradox, one has\nto prove that there exists a unique number \\(N\\) in (0, 1), satisfying\nthe condition given by Richard (see\n 2.5\n above), but this condition, and hence \\(N\\) itself, depends on\n\\(\\Val\\), which is possibly obscure and cannot be defined exactly\naccording to the rules of mathematics (p. 352, p. 358). The conclusion\nis that no such a real can exist and Richard’s definition is\ndefective in the same way that “the greatest prime number”\nis. \nSchönflies and Brouwer, by contrast, reacted to the paradoxes\nwhile strongly opposing axiomatic and formal methods. \nSchönflies (1906) stuck to a contentual, genetic conception of\nsets. According to him, sets are generated and, once formed, are\nconceptually invariant. When a new set is built up, it is added to\nthose that have been used in forming it, without altering their\npre-existent structure. So self-membership does not make sense, the\nuniversal set does not exist and Russell’s paradox disappears.\nHis view can be seen as hinting at a sort of iterative conception of\nsets. For Schönflies, the contradictions arise in logic, as\nopposed to mathematics, and are due to the scholastic nature of logic.\nHe regarded logic as having an unhealthy influence\n(“unheilvollen Einflüss”) on mathematics\n(“Für den Cantorismus, aber gegen den\nRussellismus” is the final motto of Schönflies\n1911). \nBrouwer’s approach to paradoxes was also based on a contentual\nconception of mathematics. It can be found in the dissertation of\n1907, chapter III (cf. also van Dalen 1999, pp. 105). As to\nRussell’s contradiction, Brouwer noticed that the usual logical\nprinciples only hold for words with mathematical content, not for\nlinguistic systems, like those of Peano or Russell. For instance, in\norder to decide whether a class falls under a propositional function,\nthe class has to be a completed totality. The contradictions show that\nthere are propositional functions which define complementary\n(disjoint) classes and yet do not satisfy the tertium non datur.\nSimilar ideas can be found in the philosophical paper of 1908,\n“On the unreliability of tertium non datur” (see van Dalen\n1999). \nA positive by-product of Richard’s paradox in Brouwer’s\nwork (1907, p. 149) is the notion of denumerably unfinished\nset, i.e., a set in which we can determine only denumerable\nsubsets of elements, but where these denumerable subsets do not\nexhaust the given set, so that one can immediately produce new\nelements of the set from any given denumerable such subset. Typical\nexamples of denumerably unfinished sets are the totality of countable\nordinals, the points of the continuum, and in particular, as could be\nshown using Richard’s paradox, the set of all definable points\nof the continuum (1907, p. 150). Brouwer considers\nBurali-Forti’s contradiction not as a mathematical paradox,\nsince it concerns a logical structure (the collection of all\nordinals), which is not a well-defined mathematical object and has no\nproper mathematical content. Mathematically speaking, the\ncontradiction can be avoided by denying that the largest well-ordered\ntype has a successor order type (p. 153; this is analogous to\nBernstein 1905b). \nAmong the French mathematicians, the semi-intuitionist Borel (1908)\nintroduced the distinction between effectively enumerable\nsets and denumerable ones. The Richard paradox is then solved\nby observing that Richard’s set \\(E\\) is certainly denumerable,\nbecause one can only determine at most a denumerable set of reals by\nfinite means. Yet \\(E\\) is not effectively enumerable, i.e., one\ncannot produce with finitely many words a procedure for assigning\nunambiguously a rank (i.e., a position) to each element of the set. In\norder to make the enumeration of \\(E\\) effective, one ought to have\nsolved all the mathematical problems which one could possibly state,\nbecause there are expressions which become definitions of a real only\nmodulo a proof or solution of a certain problem. Borel has in mind a\nparticular example: consider the expression “the unique\ntranscendental number whose decimal expansion is obtained from that of\n\\(\\pi\\) by replacing everywhere 7 with 8, and 8 with 7”. Of\ncourse, this is a good definition only if we have shown that the\nnumber is not algebraic (see Borel 1908. p. 446). \nBorel, like Poincaré, adheres to a point of\nview—definability in finitely many words—which is an\nextension of the algebraic, Kroneckerian point of view: only objects\nconstructible in finitely many steps are proper mathematical objects.\nHowever, unlike Poincaré, he disregards the problem of\npredicative definitions: for him all paradoxes of set theory derive\nfrom viewing the proposition that every denumerable set is effectively\nenumerable (“Tout ensemble dénombrable est\neffectivement énumérable”) as evident, which\nis false. \nOn the side of mathematical foundations, three chapters of Gerhard\nHessenberg’s Bericht (1906) on the fundamentals of set\ntheory are devoted to foundational questions. They contain interesting\nideas about the philosophy of mathematics, which unfortunately cannot\nbe discussed in detail here. For instance, Hessenberg underlines the\ndistinction between set theoretic definitions which give criteria for\neffectively deciding membership in a given set, and\ndefinitions which don’t. Concerning Kronecker’s\nconstructive criticism of the arithmetized continuum, he holds that,\nalthough each irrational number determines an infinite fraction and\neach infinite fraction possesses a formation rule\n(“Bildungsgesetz”), it is not true that such a rule is\ngiven by explicit finite means. For otherwise, we could\nderive (a form of) the paradox of finite denotation, i.e.,\nwere formation laws to coincide with definable ones, they would be at\nmost denumerable and hence the reals would be denumerable, against\nCantor’s theorem. \nIn dealing with set theoretic contradictions, Hessenberg distinguishes\nthe ‘ultrafinite’ (paragraphs 96–99) from the\n‘transfinite’: this latter notion is an exclusive\nattribute of sets. By contrast, the collections involved in the\nparadoxes (such as the Russell set, the set of all sets, of all\nthings, and of all ordinal numbers) are ultrafinite. \nAs to the proposed solutions of the paradoxes, Hessenberg was inspired\nby a Kantian idea. Just as in the natural sciences antinomies arise if\nNature is conceived as a closed whole, similarly the collection\n\\(\\mathbf{ON}\\) and the set of all sets cannot be conceived as\ncompleted totalities. Hence the distinction\n‘ultrafinite’/‘transfinite’ is apparently in\naccord with a theoretical approach which is close to Russell’s\nlimitation of size doctrine. \nClose to the same philosophical inspiration, the influential paper of\nGrelling and Nelson (1908) provides an attempt to unify paradoxes and\nto isolate their underlying structure. The philosopher Leonard Nelson\nwas a prominent figure in the Göttingen of the early twentieth\ncentury, who had Hilbert’s strong support (see Peckhaus 1990).\nThe paper is part of a project to develop a philosophically minded\n“kritische Mathematik”. It contains a new paradox\n(credited to Grelling) with a semantical flavor (see also the entry\n self-reference): \nZermelo’s axiomatization of set theory (1908; for more details\nsee entries on\n set theory,\n the early development of set theory,\n alternative axiomatic set theories)\n supplied a sensible tool for blocking contradictions. The main ideas\nof the axiomatization can be summarized as follows: (i) naïve\ncomprehension is restricted to a separation axiom, i.e., to a\nprinciple granting the existence of enough subsets of an already given\nset of objects (numbers, points, functions on a given space);\n‘enough subsets’ here refers to all the subsets\nspecifiable by means of definite conditions involving the\nprimitive notions (set equality and membership) and satisfying the\nlaws of classical logic; (ii) there are axioms ensuring that the basic\noperations of forming singleton, union, pairing, and power set are\nwell defined and that there exist at least an infinite set and the\nempty set; (iii) extensionality is assumed: two sets are equal if and\nonly if they have the same elements; (iv) an axiom of choice is\npostulated, which allows selecting a choice set out of any family of\ndisjoint non-empty sets. \nIt is immediate to see that Burali-Forti’s antinomy cannot be\nderived in Zermelo’s system, since the collection of all order\ntypes does not exist as a set, and Russell’s paradox simply\nbecomes the theorem that there does not exist a universal set. \nHowever, one could raise at least two objections against the theory on\ndifferent grounds. First of all, Zermelo’s approach is actually\nhighly impredicative and impredicativity was regarded as\nindispensable by him (else one would be forced to reject standard\nmathematics, e.g., Zermelo believed this was the case even with the\nCauchy-Weierstrass proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra). But\nimpredicativity makes the construction of a model or of an\ninterpretation more difficult and less evident. The second point is\nthat Zermelo believed that the paradox of finite denotation (mentioned\nby Hessenberg) and Richard’s are blocked in set theory, as the\nseparation axiom ought to yield clear criteria for defining sets. But\nthis is not the case, because Zermelo’s notion of definite\nproperty (definite Eigenschaft) is given informally and is\nultimately vague. \nThe latter issue was taken up in Weyl’s\n“Habilitation” lecture (1910), where he addressed the\ngeneral question: when is a relation explicitly definable from a set\nof given primitive concepts in mathematics? First of all, he\nconsiders, as a concrete case study, the problem of characterizing the\nexplicitly definable concepts of elementary plane geometry: these can\nbe inductively generated by means of five basic definition principles\nfrom two suitably chosen primitive concepts (e.g., the identity\nbetween points =, and the ternary relation \\(E(a, b, c)\\), ‘the\ndistance of point \\(a\\) from point \\(b\\) is the same as the distance\nof point \\(a\\) from point \\(c\\)’). \nThe five definition principles correspond to a finite\naxiomatization of the elementary comprehension principle, and\nthey imply the existence of exactly those sets (relations), which are\ndefinable by formulas in the elementary language comprising two\npredicate symbols for \\(=, E\\). More explicitly, one requires closure\nunder the logical operations of negation, conjunction, existential\nquantification and suitable combinatorial operations of permutation\nand expansion. \nIn the light of the geometric example, Weyl attacks the concept\n“defined by means of finitely many words” as not precise,\nand long before Fraenkel and Skolem, he succeeds in making the\nseparation principle precise: he simply replaces Zermelo’s\ninformal concept of definite property with the notion of\n‘relation explicitly definable from extensional equality and\nmembership by means of the basic elementary logical principles’\n(we should simply say: first-order definable). \nAccording to Weyl, Richard’s paradox teaches us the following\ndistinction: on the one hand, we are able to characterize only\ndenumerably many subsets of a given set by means of explicit\ndefinitions; but, on the other hand, new objects and (possibly\nuncountable) sets can be introduced by applying the remaining set\ntheoretic operations, like power set or union. \nWeyl addressed the problem of generating the admissible properties\nover a given domain a few years later in Das Kontinuum\n(1918). As in 1910, the set of sets of natural numbers that are\ndefinable via admissible operations (to which now also a form of\niteration is added) is denumerable. By Cantor’s\nargument there is no relation which parametrizes all subsets of\nnatural numbers (Weyl 1918, section 5). Weyl apparently followed a\nrelativistic attitude, according to which the extension of the\nuniverse of sets and their properties depend on the operations which\nare accepted to construct sets (see also the entry\n Hermann Weyl). \nIt should be stressed that Weyl’s attitude towards\nGrelling’s antinomy is utterly negative: he considers it pure\nScholasticism (Weyl 1918, section 1): there is no way, according to\nhim, of assigning a meaning to ‘heterological’ and one\nshould ultimately resolve these problems by appealing to\nphilosophy. \nIt is interesting to observe that, in the light of recent\ndevelopments, Weyl’s negative verdict ought to be weakened (see\nsection 6). \nIn the period until 1930, the problem of paradoxes led naturally to\nand was subsumed under the investigation of logical calculi (its final\nby-product being the Hilbert-Ackermann textbook of\n1928). This in turn opened the way to the\nsimplification of type theory, to important generalizations of the\nnotion of set, and to an almost final axiomatic elaboration of set\ntheory (along the Zermelian route, but also following the new path\nopened up by Johann von Neumann). The basic logical tool is\nessentially axiomatic formal analysis. \nDo circular objects exist in set theory? Zermelo’s view of sets\nas axiomatized in 1908 did not in itself exclude the possibility of\nself-membership. The problem was raised anew by Mirimanoff (1917a,\n1917b, 1920; see also the entry\n Zermelo’s axiomatization of set theory).\n Once circular sets are allowed, a strengthening of extensional\nequality by means of a suitable isomorphism relation\n(bisimulation, in current terminology) is needed which essentially\ncorresponds to the isomorphism of the trees picturing the given sets.\nRussell’s argument then suggests a distinction between sets\nof first kind, which are not isomorphic with any of their own\nelements, and sets of second kind which are indeed isomorphic\nwith at least one of their elements. In the light of this distinction,\nRussell’s contradiction shows that the collection R of sets\nof first kind does not exist as a set. Indeed, a set of second\nkind always contains a set of second kind; hence a set of sets of\nfirst kind must be of first kind. If \\(R\\) were a set, it should be of\nfirst kind; but then it could not contain all sets of first kind.\nMirimanoff 1917a then introduced the fundamental distinction between\nordinary (well-founded) and extraordinary\n(non-well-founded) sets: a set \\(X\\) is ordinary if every\n\\(\\in\\)-descending chain in \\(X\\) is finite; it is extraordinary,\notherwise (there exist infinite \\(\\in\\)-descending chains). It follows\nthat all sets of the second kind are extraordinary, but the converse\nis not true (for instance, consider the set \\(E=\\{e_1, E_1\\}\\), where\n\\(E_1 = \\{e_1,e_2, E_2 \\}\\), \\(E_2 =\\{e_1, e_2, e_3, E_3\\}\\),\netc.). \nFor the history of paradoxes, it is important to emphasize that\nMirimanoff 1917a gave a generalization of the Burali-Forti antinomy,\nthe paradox of grounded sets. This paradox actually proves\nthat the collection \\(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{F}\\) of ordinary sets (on a\ngiven set of atoms) is not itself a set. Indeed, let\n\\(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{F}\\) be the set of grounded (= ordinary =\nwellfounded) sets; then \\(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{F}\\) itself is grounded,\nfor were \\(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{F} \\ni x_0 \\ni x_1 \\ni x_2\\ldots\\), then\n\\(x_0\\) would be an ungrounded member of \\(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{F}\\),\nwhich is absurd. Hence \\(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{F} \\in\n\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{F}\\), so \\(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{F}\\) is ungrounded,\ncontradiction (the same paradox will also appear in Shen-Yuting\n1953). \nMirimanoff’s work is also important for the foundations of set\ntheory. He introduced the notion of ordinal rank for ordinary sets and\nhe noticed that ordinary sets can be arranged in a cumulative\nhierarchy, indexed by their ranks. However, the existence of a\ncumulative structure of ordinary sets is not considered as a ground\nfor excluding extraordinary sets. Mirimanoff (pp. 212–213)\nexplicitly points to the use of extraordinary sets for modelling\nmirror-like situations. He mentions the case of a book \\(B\\)\nwhose covering is decorated with a picture \\(J\\) representing two\nchildren glancing at the same book, i.e. to the picture \\(J1\\) of\n\\(B\\). In \\(J_1\\) one could perceive again the two children and the\npicture \\(J_{11}\\) of the book in perspective. Now \\(J\\) can be\nregarded as a set including as elements the two children \\(e_1\\) and\n\\(e_2\\), and the picture \\(J_1\\) of \\(J\\), which in turn decomposes\ninto the pictures \\(e_{11}, e_{22}\\) of \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\), and the\npicture \\(J_{11}\\) of \\(J_1\\), and so on ad infinitum, Now \\(J\\) is\nisomorphic to one of its elements, i.e. \\(J_1: J\\) can be considered\nas a set of second kind and hence extraordinary. This non-mathematical\nexample is suggestive of later developments, i.e., the theory of\nnon-well founded sets and its recent applications to semantics. A set\n\\(E\\) of second kind is also assimilated to an impredicative\ncollection in the sense of Poincaré (Mirimanoff 1920, p. 34)\nbecause of its circularity: indeed, \\(E\\) is given by a condition\n\\(E=(y, z,\\ldots ,a, b, c,\\ldots)\\), where \\(y, z,\\ldots\\) depend on\n\\(E\\). \nOn the other hand, in Mirimanoff’s 1917a there is a remarkable\nuse of Burali-Forti’s paradox which suggests a necessary\ncondition for set-hood in terms of size, viz., if a collection is in\nbijection with the set of all ordinals, then it does not exist as a\nset. In Mirimanoff 1917a,b, one can also find the idea of von Neumann\nordinal (von Neumann 1923, 1925) and a form of the replacement axiom\nis present. \nVon Neumann’s system of 1925 deals with an alternative axiomatic\nfoundation of set theory. There are two sorts of objects: objects of\ntype II (functions, corresponding to classes) and objects of type I\n(arguments), linked by the application operation of a function to its\narguments. The two domains partly overlap and there are objects of\ntype I–II, corresponding to sets (as functions which can also be\narguments). The fundamental axiom IV-2 then states that an object\n\\(a\\) is a proper class (i.e., it is not type I–II) if and only\nif the totality of its members can be mapped onto the totality of all\narguments. The Burali-Forti antinomy shows that the class\n\\(\\mathbf{ON}\\) of all ordinals is not a set, which implies with axiom\nIV-2 that there is an application of \\(\\mathbf{ON}\\) onto the universe\nof all sets, and hence that the universe of sets is\nwell-ordered. Conceptually, the system settles the problem of\nmaking Cantor’s distinction between inconsistent and consistent\nprecise and applicable (against Hilbert’s early criticism); it\nalso shows that global choice becomes a theorem on a suitable view of\nsets. Though circular objects cannot live in von Neumann’s\nhierarchical model of set theory, they can be found in the\ninvestigations of other mathematicians and logicians, e.g., Finsler.\nAccording to Finsler, paradoxes hinge upon circular notions, but\ncircularity does not necessarily lead to contradictions. In\nparticular, Finsler regards Cantor’s notion of set as\nintrinsically circular: sets depend on sets or on general things\ndepending also on sets and the associated dependence graph\ncan drive us back in a circle. For the contemporary reader, it is\nworth mentioning that an original intuition of Finsler 1926b is the\nuse of graph theory for representing circular structures. So\narrows are used for interpreting membership, and it is not difficult\nto imagine a set that has itself as unique element and more\ncomplicated circular situations (for more on Finsler’s set\ntheory see Holmes 1996 in Other Internet Resources). Finsler 1926\napplies Richard’s paradox in order to produce metamathematical\nresults, in particular ‘formally undecidable\npropositions’. However, Finsler’s arguments are not\nconclusive and cannot be considered a proper anticipation of the\nGödel incompleteness theorems (on the limit of his ideas, see the\ndiscussion in van Heijenoort, 438–440); but they show that an\nattentive reading of the paradox might have unexpected\napplications. \nConcerning the subsequent developments in connection with logic, the\nprocess of streamlining the tools of logic steadily continued in\nGöttingen through the work of Hilbert and his school. This is\nespecially clear from his unpublished lecture notes (e.g., those of\nWinter-Semester course 1917–1918 Prinzipien der\nMathematik), which are in many respects close to the textbook of\nHilbert-Ackermann of 1928 and which contain formulations of first and\nsecond order logic, together with ramified type theory and the axiom\nof reducibility. Paradoxes are derived by allowing a suitable form of\nunrestricted comprehension; the problematic assumption is located in\nthe admissibility of predicates and propositions as objects,\ni.e., formally in the expressions \\(X(Y), P(P)\\). Variants of the\ntraditional Liar and of the Berry antinomy are introduced.\nInterestingly, Hilbert sticks essentially to type theory (he does not\nlecture upon Zermelo’s system); he defines the ramified theory\nof types with the axiom of reducibility, proving that certain parts of\nmathematics can be carried out in the system (on Russell’s\ninfluence, see Mancosu 2003). \nThat type theory and Russell’s work had a central place not only\nin Hilbert’s Göttingen is further attested to by the work\nof Chwistek and Ramsey, who attempted a revision of Principia\nMathematica (PM) from opposite stand-points. Both authors\nrejected ramified type theory (RTT, in short) and the axiom of\nreducibility. Their work can be considered a typical outcome of the\nprocess that was to yield streamlined versions of logical formalisms.\nInsofar as paradoxes are concerned, the main problem is to show that\nRTT is not required for solving the paradoxes. \nThe solution proposed by Chwistek was prompted by a\nconstructivistic/predicativistic conception. His position in 1921 was\nthat Principia Mathematica were not enough to avoid\nRichard’s classical antinomy. On the other hand, Chwistek\nproposed a version of the Liar that can be reconstructed in the simple\ntheory of types without the axiom of reducibility, once we are allowed\nto quantify over all propositions. On his side, Chwistek adhered to a\nkind of nominalistic position, and tried to develop a theory of\nconstructive types for the foundations of analysis (his attempt of\nfounding mathematics without the axiom of reducibility was called\n“heroic” in the introduction to the second edition of the\nPrincipia Mathematica, 1925, see Linsky 2004). \nRamsey 1926 introduced the by-now standard distinction between\nlogical and epistemological contradictions (but see already\nPeano 1906, and section 3.3.1 of this entry). While logical\ncontradictions involve mathematical or logical terms, like class,\nnumber, and hence show that our logic or mathematics is problematic,\nsemantical contradictions involve, besides purely logical terms,\nnotions like “thought”, “language”,\n“symbolism”, which, according to Ramsey, are empirical\n(not formal) terms. Hence these contradictions are due to faulty ideas\nabout thought or language and they properly belong to\n“epistemology”. \nAccording to Ramsey, the antinomies of the first group (such as\nRussell’s, or Burali-Forti’s) can be avoided by referring\nto a universe of mathematical objects which is structured into types\nof individuals, functions of individuals, functions of functions of\nindividuals, etc. Quantification over arbitrary types is legitimate\nand hence types are closed under impredicative comprehension, which is\nconsidered necessary for mathematics. Types are intrinsic to logical\nand mathematical objects and the logical paradoxes are exactly those\nwhich require type distinctions to be solved (e.g., self-membership is\nblocked for objects in the type-theoretic hierarchy). In order to\nsolve the semantical antinomies (e.g., the Liar, Berry’s),\nRamsey proposes to distinguish several notions of meaning. In light of\nlater developments, it is interesting to note that for him\nsemantics is not a viable universal notion: in particular, it\nis impossible to obtain “an all-inclusive relation of meaning\nfor propositional functions. Whatever one we take there is still a way\nof constructing a symbol to mean in a way not included in our\nrelation. The meanings of meaning form an illegitimate totality”\n(Ramsey 1926, p. 372). This yields the clue to the solution of\nGrelling’s paradox (see 3.3.2). Let \\(R\\) be the meaning\nrelation linking an adjective \\(f\\) to the corresponding propositional\nfunction denoted by \\(F\\) (so that \\(f R F\\) holds). In the definition\nof “heterological” we do use the relation \\(R: x\\) is\nheterological iff there exists \\(F\\) such that \\(F\\) does not apply to\n\\(x\\) and \\(x R F\\). Now, there exists a propositional function, say\n\\(H\\), which is the meaning of the adjective\n“heterological”. Ramsey’s point is that this sense\nof meaning cannot be the same as that given by \\(R\\) and this blocks\nthe contradiction, when we apply \\(H\\) to “heterological”\n(ibid.,p. 370). So one needs a new meaning relation depending on the\ngiven fixed \\(R\\). These ideas foreshadow those of Tarski. (For an\nanalysis of semantical antinomies in a ramified context, compare also\nthe later contribution of Church 1976, also reconsidered and\ncriticized in Martino 2001.). \nWith the work of Gödel and Tarski, paradoxical arguments were\nreshaped into fixed point results, while the semantic conception of\ntruth, the formalization of semantics and the arithmetization of\nsyntax yielded firm grounds for systematic metamathematical\ninvestigations. In addition, an effort was made to elaborate new grand\nlogics as a reaction to the logic of Principia Mathematica.\nConceptually, the notions of (self-applicable)\nfunction-in-intension/operation and property/ predicate were accepted\nas primitive, and the very mechanism of definition/combination of\nconcepts was studied. This line of thought gave impulse to the\nelaboration of syntactical methods within combinatory logic and to the\nrise of recursion theory. The diagnosis of the paradoxes was further\nenriched by a subtler analysis of purely logical features of\nparadoxical reasoning: this is especially true for negation and the\ncrucial role of contraction and duplication properties built into the\nlaws of standard implication. Three valued logic was applied to\nnaïve comprehension. \nThe heuristic role of paradoxes is witnessed by Gödel himself,\nwhen he intuitively and explicitly relates his construction of\nformally undecidable sentences to epistemological paradoxes\n(“the analogy with the Richard antinomy leaps to the eye”,\nGödel 1931, van Heijenoort 1967, p. 599). However,\nself-referential constructions attained an adequate degree of\nmathematical rigor and became genuine mathematical tools only when non\ntrivial number-theoretic techniques were put to work (see the entry\n recursive functions),\n for instance in the analysis of syntactical substitution and in\nproviding arithmetical models of formal provability (the crucial role\nof substitution for producing contradictions was already noticed by\nRussell, although he did not publish this; see Pelham and Urquhart\n1994). Conceptually, it is clear from Gödelian constructions that\nself-reference by itself is innocuous if it is understood in the\nindirect sense: one can have formulas \\(\\phi(x)\\), expressing\nproperties of their own “name” \\(\\ulcorner \\phi\n\\urcorner\\), but no dangerous circularity arises. \nGödel’s construction was soon given a general form, as a\ngeneral diagonalization lemma, which refers to arbitrary definable\nproperties. This is to be found in Carnap 1934b, p. 91, Carnap 1934a,\np. 270, and in Rosser 1939, p. 57, Lemma 1: \nFor every formula \\(\\psi(v)\\) with only \\(v\\) free, there exists a\nsentence \\(\\phi\\) such that \nis provable (see also the entry on\n Gödel’s incompleteness theorems). \nAs a matter of fact the lemma has become the standard tool for\nproducing self-referential statements and for transforming the\nsemantical paradoxes into indefinability and (formal) undecidability\nresults (see the entry on\n self-reference).\n The algebra underlying the Gödelian constructions will be\ngrasped only much later during the 1970’s. It is also important\nto stress that a few years later (1938) an analog of the\ndiagonalization lemma (the so-called second recursion theorem) was\ndiscovered by Kleene and was soon to become a basic tool in the\nfoundations of recursion theory and computability theory. \nIt is evident from the work done in the twenties surveyed above that\nthe problem of finding a formal solution to the semantical paradoxes,\nsuch as the Liar and the Richard paradox, remained essentially open.\nType-theoretic solutions had not been pursued to the extent of\nproviding a systematic formal analysis of semantical notions (like\ntruth or definability). But why would this problem be worth studying\nfrom a logical and mathematical point of view? As a matter of fact,\nsemantical notions—in particular the notion of\ndefinability—were more or less explicitly used in certain parts\nof set theory (descriptive set theory) and in more “set\ntheoretically inclined” parts of function theory, which were\ncultivated by Polish mathematics in the twenties. At the same time,\nthe project of a formal methodology and of a scientific semantics was\ndeveloped by prominent Polish philosophers and logicians working in\nLvov (now Lviv) and Warsaw (Lesniewski, Łukasiewicz, Chwistek;\nsee Wolenski 1995 and the entries on\n Lesniewski,\n on\n Łukasiewicz\n and on the\n Lvov-Warsaw school).\n For instance, Chwistek attempted an elementary semantics on the\nground of a nominalistic foundational program, where sets are\nidentified with propositional functions, extensionality is rejected\nand the fundamental notion of semantics is the substitution relation\n“\\(H\\) is the result of the substitution of \\(G\\) for \\(F\\) in\n\\(E\\)” (Chwistek 1933, p. 374). In this stimulating environment,\nTarski developed his fundamental analysis of semantical paradoxes,\nfirst dating back to 1929 and 1930, reported by Łukasiewicz to\nthe Polish Society of Sciences in Warsaw in 1931 and then detailed in\nthe long memoir of 1935 (see the entries on\n Tarski\n and on\n Tarski’s truth definition). \nFirst of all, the analysis of the Liar paradox starts out by\nspecifying a formal requirement to be met in the semantical\ninvestigation of truth, i.e. “a materially adequate\n(sachlich zutreffende) definition” of the term\n“true sentence ” (wahre Aussage). This amounts to\nthe celebrated schema (T), which can be roughly stated in simplified\nform as: \nwhere \\(p\\) stands for a sentence and \\(x\\) is a name of \\(p\\) (the\nidea being in accord to the classical correspondence intuition). The\nresult that Tarski draws from the Liar is that there cannot be any\ninterpreted language which is free from contradictions, obeys the\nclassical laws of logic, and meets the requirements (I)–(III),\nwhere \nGiven these essential obstacles, Tarski provides a structural\ndefinition of the basic semantical notions, i.e., one that relies\nonly on the logical form of an expression and the fact that\nexpressions are recursively defined. But this route is only viable for\na language which is structurally described, e.g., a formalized\nlanguage. For such languages, which are usually closed under\nquantification and contain formulas with free variables, Tarski\nelaborates an appropriate notion of satisfaction, which\nallows him to introduce the notions of definability, denotation,\ntruth, logical consequence. It is then possible to give a precise\nversion and a proof of the adequacy condition (T) in a meta-science,\nwhose principles comprise: (i) general logical axioms, (ii) special\naxioms that depend upon the object theory we consider, and (iii)\naxioms for dealing with the fundamental properties of the structural\nnotions, i.e., principles of proof and definition by\ninduction. Given this semantical machinery, Tarski can solve in\nthe negative the problem of the existence of (a formal counterpart of)\na universal language, i.e., one where it is possible to\ndefine an adequate notion of truth for the same language. Although the\ntheory of simple types, (where the type 0 is the type of individuals;\nthe type \\(n+1\\) is the collection of all classes of type \\(n\\)\nobjects) with the axiom of infinity and extensionality is apparently a\ngood candidate as a general metatheory, it is shown that whichever\ndefinition we choose in the theory of types for the term\n“true”, then it is possible to deduce in the same theory\nthe negation of some instance of the adequacy schema (T). In the proof\nof this theorem, Tarski applies arithmetization and diagonalization,\nhence following the Gödelian pattern. On the positive side, the\nconcept of truth can be adequately defined for any formalized language\nL in a language (the so-called metalanguage), provided it is of higher\norder than L. Also, Tarski’s semantics makes precise\nGödel’s remark (1931, footnote 48) that “the true\nreason of the incompleteness is that the formation of ever higher\ntypes can be continued into the transfinite[…], while in any\nformal system at most denumerably many of them are available”.\nTarskian semantical notions play the role of the higher types hinted\nat by Gödel. To sum up, the outcome of Tarski’s work is\nthat the semantical notions are eliminated in favor of the\n(extensional) notions of type or set, and a theoretical explanation of\nsemantical paradoxes is finally achieved. \nIn the twenties and in the early thirties, the orthodox view of logic\namong mathematical logicians was more or less type- or set theoretic.\nHowever, there was an effort to develop new grand logics as\nsubstitutes for the logic of Principia Mathematica. These\nframeworks arose both as attempts to recover the simplicity of the\ntype-free approach, as derived from the so-called naive comprehension\nprinciple, as well as in order to satisfy metamathematical needs, such\nas the clarification of fundamental concepts underlying the notions of\n“formal system,” “formalism,”\n“rule,” etc. In particular, Church and Curry proposed\ntheories which (i) assume as primitive the notions of self-applicable\nfunction-in-intension (operation), and (ii) stress the very mechanism\nof definition/combination of concepts. If one looks closely at the\ndevelopment of these systems, one can see that paradoxical\nconstructions have become essential tools for defining objects and\nproving non-trivial logical mathematical facts. Following ideas\nof Schönfinkel and aiming at a mathematical analysis of the\nsubstitution process, Curry’s 1930 thesis introduced a formal\nlanguage based on basic general operators, the so-called\ncombinators \\(B\\) (composition), \\(C\\) (permutation), \\(W\\)\n(duplication), \\(K\\) (cancellation), \\(Q\\) (equality), and logical\nconstants like the universal quantifier and implication. Expressions\nare then inductively generated by application from constants;\nintuitively, a term \\(M\\) stands for a function, and the applicative\nterm \\(MN\\) (juxtaposition plays the role of application and\nparentheses are associated to the left) denotes the value of the term\nobtained by replacing the first variable of \\(M\\) with \\(N\\).\nSelf-application \\(MM\\) is admissible and this feature tells us that\nthe objects of combinatory logic cannot be simply interpreted as\nset-theoretic functions. The formal system consists of standard\nequations on combinators (e.g, \\(Bxyz=x(yz), Wxy=xyy\\), or\n\\(Cxyz=xzy)\\), rules for equality and the logical constants; its main\ngoal is to derive equalities \\(X=Y\\) and to make assertions of the\nform \\(\\vdash X (= X\\) is provable). Combinatory logic is a theory\nwhich analyzes the modes of combinations of formal objects,\nsubstitution, and the notions of proposition and propositional\nfunction (see the entry on\n combinatory logic\n for a proper introduction to variants of the formalism and an\noverview of the properties of related calculi). For Curry, the root of\nthe paradoxes is found in assuming that combinations of concepts\nare always propositions. The notion of proposition becomes a\ntheoretical concept, which is decided by the theory. Types\nare not assigned to the expressions of the formal system at the\noutset, but are instead inferred by means of the system itself, which\nhas a dual nature: it can derive identities, but also truths. In\nparticular, if \\(\\vdash MN\\) is derived, this can be read as\n“\\(N\\) is of type \\(M\\)” or “\\(N\\) is an element of\n\\(M\\)”. These ideas foreshadow fundamental developments such as\nthe so-called formulas-as types interpretation (see Howard\n1968). \nChurch’s formalism—originally introduced in Church 1932,\n1933 as a set of postulates for the foundation of formal\nlogic—includes conversion (i.e., computational) rules, which\nallow the replacement of terms with intensionally equivalent ones, and\nrules for asserting certain terms as “true”. The syntax\nyields a general notation system for functions, based on an\napplicative language, where there is one basic category of terms\n(well-formed formulas in his terminology). Some terms are formally\nprovable (or assertable) and are classified as true. Terms are\ninductively defined from a set of basic constants and variables by\nmeans of application and the characteristic lambda abstraction\noperator: if \\(M\\) is a term containing the variable \\(x, \\lambda\nx.M\\) is a term, naming the function defined by \\(M\\). The basic\nconstants designate logical operations: (a kind of restricted) formal\nimplication; existential quantifier, conjunction, negation,\ndescription operation, and generalized abstraction (i.e., if \\(F\\) is\nformal logical equivalence, \\(A(F, M)\\) is “what \\(M\\) has in\ncommon with any \\(N\\) formally equivalent to \\(M\\)”). It turns\nout that Church’s logic can interpret naive class theory and\nhence the system is suspiciously strong and expressive (strength and\nexpressivity are inherited by the formalism which was devised out of\nChurch’s: see the entry on\n the lambda calculus).\n Church’s hope was that contradictions could be avoided by\nensuring the possibility that a propositional function be\nundefined for some argument. \nHowever, the theories of Curry and Church were almost immediately\nshown inconsistent in 1934, by Kleene and Rosser, who (essentially)\nproved a version of the Richard paradox (both systems can provably\nenumerate their own provably total definable number theoretic\nfunctions). The result was triggered by Church himself in 1934, when\nhe used the Richard paradox to prove a kind of incompleteness theorem\n(with respect to statements asserting the totality of number theoretic\nfunctions). \nThe reason for the inconsistencies was eventually clarified by\nCurry’s 1941 essay. There he distinguishes two basic\ncompleteness notions: a system \\(S\\) is deductively complete,\nif, whenever it derives a proposition \\(B\\) from the hypothesis \\(A\\),\nthen it also derives the implication \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) (deduction\ntheorem or introduction rule for implication); \\(S\\) is\ncombinatorially complete (Curry 1941, p. 455.) if, whenever\n\\(M\\) is a term of the system possibly containing an indeterminate\n\\(x\\), there exists a term (Church’s \\(\\lambda x.M)\\) naming the\nfunction of \\(x\\) defined by \\(M\\). Curry then remarks that the\nparadox of Kleene-Rosser arises because Church’s and\nCurry’s systems satisfy both kinds of completeness, thus showing\nthat the two properties are incompatible. In the more\ntechnical part of the paper, Curry carefully axiomatizes the main\ningredients exploited by Kleene and Rosser and carries out a lot of\nnon-trivial work both on the logical side and the mathematical side\n(e.g, to develop a portion of recursive arithmetic, to define the\nexistence of an enumerator, i.e., a term \\(T\\) such that, if \\(a\\) is\nthe Gödel number of a closed term \\(M\\) and \\(Z_a\\) is the term\nformally representing \\(a\\), then \\(TZ_a =M\\) is provable in \\(S\\),\netc.). Curry’s proof of the inconsistencies of combinatory\nsystems is unsatisfactory because it heavily uses a detour through\nnumber theory and Gödelization, which, as a matter of fact, is\nunnecessary as Curry himself soon discovered and presented in a paper\nwith the same title as the one by Kleene and Rosser, “in\ndeference to the original discoverers of the contradiction”\n(Curry 1942). The main result in it is the following theorem\n(Curry’s paradox, see the entry\n Curry’s Paradox): \nFor the proof, it is enough to find, for any given term B, a term A\nsuch that \\(A=A\\supset B\\). Curry notes that a twofold construction is\npossible. By direct self-reference, we can choose: \\(A = HH\\), where\n\\(H=\\lambda Y (N(YY))\\) and \\(N = \\lambda X (X\\supset B)\\). On the\nother hand, one can apply indirect self-reference and exploit the\nmachinery of Curry 1941 and Kleene-Rosser: using an enumerator \\(T\\),\none sets \\(U = \\lambda X (TXX \\supset B)\\) and \\(A=UZ_u\\), being \\(u\\)\nthe Gödel number of \\(U\\). Curry suggests that these two routes\nare akin, respectively, to Russell’s paradox and to the Liar. It\nis interesting to note that the two ways correspond to by-now standard\ntools, the so-called first fixed point theorem and second\nfixed point theorem of combinatory logic and lambda calculus\n(Barendregt 1984, p. 131 and p. 143; see also the distinction between\nthe first recursion theorem and the second recursion theorem of\nclassical recursion theory, in this SEP, entry\n recursive functions). \nCurry’s analysis of the solutions to the paradox would lead us\ninto the realm of the theory of functionality, the history of\ncombinatory logic and proof theory. Here it is enough to recall that\naccording to him, a remedy would be to formulate within the system the\nvery notion of proposition, and a way to avoid the contradictions\nwould lead to a hierarchy of canonical propositions (or to a theory of\nlevels of implication, already adumbrated by Church). Related ideas\nhave been developed since the seventies by Scott 1975, Aczel 1980,\nFlagg and Myhill 1987, and others. \nIn the 1930s, an alternative route to solve the antinomies emerged.\nThis approach exploits the duplication (contraction) combinator \\(W\\)\nwhich satisfies \\(Wfx=fxx\\); if \\(N\\) represents negation and\n\\(Babc=a(bc)\\), then \\(W(BN)(W(BN))\\) is a fixed point of negation,\nand it is a functional analogue of the Russell class. On the logical\nlevel, assigning a type to \\(W\\) leads to the essential inference\napplied in the derivation of Curry’s paradox, i.e., the\ncontraction rule \\(A\\rightarrow(A\\rightarrow B)\n\\Rightarrow(A\\rightarrow B)\\). The role of contraction was noticed by\nFitch 1936, who observed that, in order to derive the Russell paradox\none considers a function of two variables, then one diagonalizes and\nregards such an object as a new unary propositional function. But this\nstep only works if \\(W\\) is accepted. Fitch then proposed a\n“non-contractive” logic, but his paper did not go beyond a\nbrief sketch of a fragment of classical logic with predicates. One has\nto wait until the mid eighties to see contraction-free logics used\nsystematically in proof theory and in theoretical computer science\n(see the entry\n linear logic). \nFitch 1942 proposed a new approach to the problem of finding\nconsistent combinatory logic systems, which were progressively\nexpanded and refined over many years (until 1980). Fitch’s\nmethod to avoid paradoxes consists of the construction of suitable\nsyntactical models, endowed with self-referential notions of class,\nmembership and truth. Truth and membership are inductively\ngenerated by iterating rules that correspond to natural logical\nclosure conditions and can be formalized by means of positive\n(i.e. negation- and implication-free) clauses. This fact implies that\nthe generation process is cumulative and becomes saturated at a\ncertain point, thus yielding consistent non-trivial interpretations\nfor truth and membership. Mathematically, a collection of positive\nclauses always gives rise to an operator, say \\(G\\), mapping sets of\nexpressions into sets of expressions and preserving the inclusion\nrelation (i.e., monotone); the saturated sets then correspond to fixed\npoints of the monotone operator \\(G\\) (i.e., to sets \\(X\\) satisfying\n\\(G(X)=X)\\), which exist according to a classical theorem about\ncomplete lattices (see Birkhoff 1967). \nIn the early 1940s, Fitch explored a purely positive (negationless)\ncombinatory system \\(K\\) with the explicit aim of defining a sort of\nuniversal formal system, where every system of logic\ncould be represented. Later he was able to strengthen his approach to\ninclude forms of negation and implication, insofar as he provided\na simultaneous generation of truth and falsehood, and this\nactually amounts to conceive truth as a partial predicate.\nFitch’s approach is radically intensional: classes are always\nclasses of expressions \\(M\\) in some language (say, of the basic\nlogic) and they are identified with attributes, while membership is\nessentially reduced to truth in the sense of \\(K\\). Thus, that \\(M\\in\nT\\) holds, essentially means that \\(M\\) truly falls under the property\nspecified (or expressed) by \\(T\\) (see also the entry on\n combinatory logic).\n Logical systems, along similar lines, were also proposed and proved\nconsistent via proof theoretic methods by Schütte in the early\nfifties (see Schütte 1960 for a comprehensive treatment). \nTo a certain extent, the ideas of Fitch can be regarded as introducing\nthe view that the basic predicates of truth and membership have to be\npartial or, if you like, three-valued. Bochvar\n(1937) outlines a proposal based on the introduction of a three-valued\nlogic, where, besides the standard truth values T (truth) and F\n(false), there exists a third value N, to be interpreted as\n“meaningless”. His logical analysis leads to the\nconclusion that the paradoxes involve meaningless statements. A\ncharacteristic feature of Bochvar’s formalism is that it\ndistinguishes two types of connectives, roughly corresponding to two\ndifferent modes of assertion. A statement \\(A\\) in itself assumes\nexactly one among the prescribed values (true, false or meaningless);\nbut the internal three-valued logical operations are also\nequipped with external logical operations, which correspond\nto statements on the metalevel and allow the use of classical logic in\ndealing with non-classical statements. Formally, he described three\nvalued truth tables for the main propositional internal connectives\n& (and), \\(\\sim\\) (negation), \\(\\vee\\) (or), \\(\\rightarrow\\)\n(implication), \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) (logical equivalence). The truth\nvalues of \\(\\sim A, A \\amp B\\), etc., coincide with their classical\nvalues if \\(A, B\\) assume classical values; they are meaningless\n(assume value N) if one among \\(A, B\\) has value N (strictness). No\nformula built up with the standard connectives can be valid (or a\ntautology, i.e., is true under all possible assignments), as \\(A\n\\rightarrow A\\) has value N, if \\(A\\) is meaningless. But there are\nconnectives allowing the formation of metatheorical\nstatements such as \\(\\vdash A, \\neg A, \\downarrow A\\), to be read\nas “\\(A\\) is true”, “\\(A\\) is false”, “A\nis meaningless” (in the given order). The value of \\(\\vdash A\n(\\neg A)\\) is true if \\(A\\) is true (false), false (true) otherwise.\nBochvar describes a version of the extended type-free logical calculus\nof Hilbert-Ackermann (1928), and, in order to dispose of the\nparadoxes, he restricts substitution and hence the comprehension\nschema of the form \n\\(\\exists F\\forall x(F(x) \\leftrightarrow \\phi)\\), where \\(\\phi\\) is\nany formula in which \\(F\\) is not free and which may or may not have\n\\(x\\) free. \nto conditions \\(\\phi\\) with only internal logical operations.\nApparently, Bochvar’s solution is not simply a gap\nsolution, where the logic is weakened; instead, he formalizes the\ndistinction between object level and metalevel in\nthe logic itself. This makes his theory quite expressive (e.g., it can\nhandle the very notion of “non-sensical”,\n“meaningless”). \nBehmann’s paper 1931 (presented in 1929) locates the source of\nthe paradoxes in the definitional machinery. The paper begins with an\nanalysis of Russell’s contradiction in the form of predicate\napplication. There he observes that, once the Russell predicate \\(F\\)\nis defined by the stipulation \nit must be possible to eliminate \\(F\\) from any argument involving it.\nBut, if we try to replace \\(F\\) by its definiens, we obtain \\(F(F)\n\\equiv \\neg F(F)\\), and we are trapped in an infinite regress, as\nthere is no \\(F\\)-free expression that could replace \\(F(F)\\). So the\ncontradiction is ascribed to an error in the theory of definitions,\nnamely to the use of definitions that give rise to an infinite chain\nof substitutions, without converging to a result. Behmann’s\ntechnical proposal consists in a reformed logic without types but with\nan added operator ! which, when given a predicate \\(\\chi\\), singles\nout exactly those arguments \\(x\\) to which \\(\\chi\\) meaningfully\napplies. For instance, the syllogism Barbara, usually stated in the\nform \nis corrected to \nwhere the range of the final quantifier is restricted to those \\(x\\)\nfor which it does make sense. Behmann did not develop a systematic\ntheory until much later and it is unclear how to interpret his special\noperator \\(!\\). Nevertheless, his work has inspired work by Aczel and\nFeferman (1980). \nLewis and Langford (1932) are led to conclusions which are not\ndissimilar to those of Behmann. According to them, the paradoxes show\nthat certain expressions do not express propositions. They\nadopt the notation \\(p : \\alpha\\) to mean that \\(p\\) is a name whose\nmeaning is the proposition \\(\\alpha\\) (so \\(p\\) and\n“\\(\\alpha\\)” denote the same entity and can replace each\nother); typically the Liar amounts to “\\(p: p\\) is false”,\nbut we can also imagine more complex self-referential situations, for\ninstance: \nIn this case, there is no contradiction, but we become entangled in a\nvicious regress (p. 440), and hence no proposition arises. In\ngeneral, one can create arbitrary complicated cycles and check that\nthey can lead either to contradictions or to infinite regress; but in\neither case, the expression fails to converge to a definite\nproposition. \nEven after the logics developed by Russell, Zermelo and Tarski had\ncreated the theoretical means to get rid of difficulties involved in\nthe notions of class, set, truth, definability, the paradoxes have\nremained alive. This probably is due to a persistent interest in\nalternative formal paradigms, to the controversial features and axioms\nof Principia Mathematica, and to the problematic place that\nself-reference occupies in mathematical logic. In this context, it is\nworth mentioning Quine’s paper of 1937 on the system NF (see the\nentry\n Quine’s New Foundations),\n which takes inspiration from the Russellian notion of typical\nambiguity, that is, from the systematic device of suppressing the\norder indices of propositional functions and their arguments, leaving\nthem to be restored at will, when needed, according to the discipline\nof type theory (see 3.2 above). The idea is to restrict naive\ncomprehension to those instances that are stratified, where\nin general a formula \\(\\phi\\) is stratified iff it is\npossible to assign a natural number (type in short) to each term\noccurrence in such a way that the resulting formula is well-formed in\nthe sense of type theory, e.g., if \\(t \\in\\) s is a subformula of\n\\(\\phi\\), the type of \\(s\\) is one greater than the type of \\(t\\),\netc.. Clearly, stratification blocks set formation when formulas of\nthe form \\(x\\in x, \\neg x\\in x\\) are present. Moreover, in NF the\nuniversal set exists. The consistency problem for NF is still open\n(though partial results are known concerning fragments with bounds on\nstratification or restriction to extensionality). Remarkably, NF\nrefutes the axiom of choice by a classical theorem of Specker. Again,\na classical result of Specker establishes the existence of a model of\nNF in a suitable version of simple type theory with a formal\ncounterpart of typical ambiguity. Paradoxes are not that far from NF.\nIn 1942 Rosser (and independently Lyndon) published a form of\nBurali-Forti’s antinomy in a seemingly natural extension (named\nML) of the system NF, obtained by adding “ultimate\nclasses”. ML was defined to avoid certain weaknesses of NF\n(e.g., with respect to number theoretic induction). Once more, the\nLyndon-Rosser result brought about the unexpected presence of a\nparadox in set theory and the foundations of mathematical logic. \nAs noticed many years ago by Kreisel and quite aptly recalled by Dean\n2020, p. 541, the right question to deal with is not how to get\nrid of paradoxes or to solve them: instead, the fruitful\nproblem is to get something out of them. Indeed, paradoxes\ncan be converted into plain undecidability/undefinability theorems,\nand this is the consequence of a systematic methodology: with the work\nof Gödel and Tarski, paradoxical arguments are reshaped into\nfixed point results, while the semantic conception of truth gives rise\nto a formalization of semantics itself, yielding firm grounds\nfor systematic metamathematical investigations, as can be seen from\nseveral early contributions by a number of logicians, e.g. Kreisel\n1950, Wang 1955. For instance, arithmetizing semantics yields a\nrefinement of the completeness theorem, the so-called arithmetized\ncompleteness theorem ART: every recursive consistent theory has a\nmodel in which the function symbols are replaced by primitive\nrecursive functions and the predicate symbols are replaced by\npredicates which are definable with just 2 quantifiers in a\nversion of formal number theory (cf. Hilbert and Bernays 1939, p. 293\nand Feferman 1960). By adding an arithmetic sentence Con(S) expressing\nthe consistency of a set theory S as a new axiom to\nelementary number theory, one can prove in the resulting system\narithmetic translations of all theorems of S. A by-product of\nthis metamathematical formalization is a de facto unification\nof set theoretic and semantic theoretic paradoxes, in the sense that\nparadoxes of either sort become tools for proving incompleteness and\nundecidability. Typically, a given paradoxical notion is formalized as\na predicate in a language of a theory interpreting (at least a\nfragment of) number theory Z; one then applies diagonalization,\nself-reference, etc., in order to get statements which correspond to\nnumber theoretic sentences that becomes undecidable or unprovable\ngiven a consistency assumption. \nPhilosophical motivations are strongly influential in contemporary\nlogical investigation of paradoxes and hence it is natural to wonder\nwhat is surviving of the initial Fregean theory of concepts, as based\nupon an inconsistent principle of abstraction and the logicistic\noutlook. Well, the answer is that a non-trivial legacy is still alive:\nthis is especially clear from the Neo-Fregean approach based on\nHume’s principle and variations thereof. Consistent subsystems\nof Frege’s Grundgesetze have been isolated and are currently\nstudied: see Burgess 2005, also for a comprehensive reference list to\npreceding work by Boolos, Wright and Hale, Heck, Wehmeier, Ferreira,\nAntonelli and May (see the essays contained in Reck and Cook 2016, and\nalso the entry\n logicism and neologicism). In\n addition, work in the Neo-Fregean tradition has shown that the\ninconsistency of the principle of extensional abstraction (Basic\nLaw V) in Grundgesetze is only an instance of a more general\nresult on the inconsistency in second order logic (extended with a\nsymbol for a function f from concepts to objects) of any abstraction\nprinciples that satisfy a condition called “part-whole”:\nif A is strictly included in B then f(A)≠f(B) (see Mancosu and\nSiskind 2019). \nOn the other hand, once we set apart the ideological inspiration of\nlogicism, we might believe that the development of logic and set\ntheory in the 20th century has fully sterilized paradoxes, and that\ncontradictions in logical systems are phenomena of the years of\nfoundational crisis only. But this is not true: paradoxes have been\ndiscovered in logical systems related to computer science. For\ninstance, half a century ago, Girard showed that a constructive theory\nof types, due to Per Martin-Löf 1971, and based on the\nCurry-Howard correspondence, is inconsistent with the existence of a\ntype of all types; the contradiction follows by means of a\ntype-theoretic reconstruction of an argument related to the\nBurali-Forti antinomy and the Mirimanoff paradox of grounded sets.\nLater, Coquand 1986 proved that certain extensions of the calculus C\nof constructions are inconsistent. Very roughly, C is a higher order\nimpredicative type theory, extending Girard’s system F, a\npowerful second-order typed lambda calculus with abstraction on types\nwhich is suitable for representing proofs of impredicative\nintuitionistic second-order logic. Coquand 1994 offered a new paradox\naffecting type theory, which refines Reynold’s result that there\nis no classical set-theoretic model of polymorphism (read:\nGirard’s system F, see the entries\n Type Theory,\n set theory: constructive and intuitionistic ZF). On the other side, a general type-free development of\nthe theory of constructions as a foundation for constructive\nprovability in logic and mathematics was originally proposed by\nKreisel and Goodman, but it turned out to be affected by an antinomy,\nwhich has been recently reconsidered by Dean and Kurokawa 2016. \nOn the borderline between foundational issues and applications in\ncomputer science, arguments with typical paradoxical flavor occur in\nthe investigation of Feferman’s explicit mathematics\n(EM), a theory of (self-applicable) operations and non-extensional\nclassifications. For instance, the existence of a strong power type\nconstruction leads to inconsistency in the so-called “theories\nof types and names”, a development of EM introduced by\nJäger 1997. Paradoxical arguments are also useful for assessing\nthe role of universes and refuting non-extensionality in EM,\nin presence of forms of uniform naïve comprehension (see\nCantini and Minari 1999). Indeed, the role of uniformity is essential\nin previous investigations. Concerning naïve comprehension, it is\nknown since the seventies (Malitz 1976) and the eighties (Weydert\n1988, Forti and Hinnion 1989) that there exist nice topological models\nof extensionality and non-uniform naïve\ncomprehension restricted to generalized positivity\nconditions. This has led to the study of so-called\nhyperuniverses. Additional consistency/inconsistency results\nabout the relationship between extensionality and uniform vs.\nnon-uniform comprehension principles can be found, e.g., in Hinnion\nand Libert 2003, Libert and Esser 2005. In a similar direction, recent\ntheoretical proposals combine anew ideas from combinatory logic and\nlambda calculus with “inductive” reinterpretations of\nnaïve comprehension and unrestricted truth schema, along a path\nalready opened by Fitch in the late forties (see Scott 1975, Flagg and\nMyhill 1987, Aczel 1980, and Feferman 1984). Beginning with 1992,\nthere was an attempt, due to K. Grue, to resurrect Church’s\nlambda calculus as a foundation of mathematics. Grue 2002 presents a\nvery strong extension of lambda calculus, the so-called map\ntheory, in which standard axiomatic set theory becomes\ninterpretable, and which can be used to shed light on the difference\nbetween Russell’s and Burali-Forti’s paradoxes. \nSince Mirimanoff, Finsler and others, logicians have studied universes\nof set theory where circular sets exist. However, it is only since the\nearly Eighties that a genuine mathematics of non-well-founded sets\n(see |\n\n set theory: non-wellfounded)\n is being developed. Using the axiom AFA of anti-foundation, direct\nself-reference is allowed in set theory, and there exist plenty of\nsets solving general self-referential equations (AFA was introduced by\nForti and Honsell in 1983; for systematic development and history, see\nAczel 1988). In particular, non-wellfounded sets are applied to the\nanalysis of the paradoxes, to the semantics of natural languages and\nto theoretical computer science (see Barwise and Etchemendy 1984,\nBarwise and Moss 1996). \nConcerning the issue whether self-reference can be avoided in deriving\nparadoxes, and hence whether there are genuine contradictions arising\nfrom ungroundedness, a positive answer has been given by the\nsemantical paradox of Yablo 1993: there are infinitely many agents ,\netc., each one claiming the same sentence: “at least one agent\nfollowing me is lying”; but this yields a contradiction –\nsee also the entries on\n self-reference\n and\n liar paradox.\n The issue this construction raises, namely whether circularity and\nself-reference are necessary and sufficient conditions to the\nappearance of paradoxes, has been further considered in Yablo 2006\n(see Cook 2014 for a comprehensive study on this matter, and Halbach\nand Zhang 2017 for a proof without diagonal lemma). Moreover, the\nconnection between the incompleteness phenomena and paradoxes has been\nextended up to include Yablo’s paradox, as a special case of\nLiar-type paradoxes (Kurahashi 2014, Kikuchi and Kurahashi 2016). \nThe analysis of self-reference and diagonalization has motivated the\napplication of algebraic and topological techniques: consider\nScott’s models for extensional lambda calculus (Scott 1972) and\ntheir subsequent categorical understanding. On the other hand,\ncategory theory has been used for new approaches to paradoxes since\nLawvere 1969. A mathematical approach to the general issue of\n“self-reference vs. unfoundedness” can be found in\nBernardi 2001, 2009. Besides Yablo’s paradox and a game\ntheoretic version of Mirimanoff’s paradox, several classical\nresults (existence of a non-r.e. set, Cantor’s theorems on the\nnondenumerability of the reals) can be transformed into existence\ntheorems for suitable unfounded chains (and formally, unfounded chains\nare regarded as generalized fixed points). \nIn standard metamathematics, an important role for a thorough\nunderstanding of the second incompleteness theorem is played by\nLöb’s theorem (Löb 1955). The proof of the\ntheorem is related to Curry’s paradox (see this entry,\nand\n Curry’s Paradox)\n and to an informal argument due to Geach 1955. Furthermore,\nLöb’s theorem is essential for defining mathematical\nstructures, which are adequate for providing versions of\nself-reference and incompleteness (see the so-called Magari\nalgebras and the modal analysis of formal provability, Boolos\n1993). In the same direction, there are applications of\nBerry’s paradox. For instance, in 1966 Vopenka proved\nthe second incompleteness theorem for the Bernays-Gödel theory of\nsets and classes using a form of the same paradox. Boolos 1989\nexploits a Berry-type argument to prove incompleteness in the form\n“there is no algorithm whose output contains all true\nstatements of arithmetic and no false ones” without\nappealing to diagonalization. The Berry paradox has been related to\nthe incompleteness phenomena also because of work (going back to the\nsixties and the seventies) in the so-called Kolmogorov complexity and\nalgorithmic information theory. In particular, Chaitin has\nshown in a number of papers how to exploit randomness to prove certain\nlimitations of formal systems (see Chaitin 1995). In connection with\nChaitin’s results, Kritchman and Raz 2011 gives a proof of the\nsecond incompleteness theorem, which is based on an argument\nresembling the surprise-test paradox (see\n epistemic paradoxes).\n In turn, this paradox can be explicitly related to Solovay’s\ncompleteness theorem of provability logic (see Montagna\n1994), and more recently Egré 2005, De Voos, Kooj and Verbrugge\n2018 applied provability logic to solving the Knower’s\nparadox. It is worth recalling that – again on the side of\nepistemic logic – self-reference is applicable in order to prove\nincompleteness in belief models. Brandenburger and Keisler\n(2006) identified a paradox of self-reference in beliefs in games,\nwhich yields a game-theoretic impossibility theorem akin to\nRussell’s Paradox. An informal version of the paradox is that\nthe following configuration of beliefs is impossible: Ann believes\nthat Bob assumes that Ann believes that Bob’s assumption is\nwrong. This is formalized to show that any belief model of a certain\nkind must have a ’hole’. An interpretation of the result\nis that “if the analyst’s tools are available to the\nplayers in a game, then there are statements that the players can\nthink about but cannot assume.” Also, the mere fact of\nparadoxes like this one, with a distinct logical\n“flavour”, but arising out of treatments involving\nepistemic notions, is notable, as it can be regarded as an indication\nfor a direction of work that, hinging upon the many examples already\navailable in the literature, is likely to expand and become systematic\nin the future thanks to the application of formal methods (see also\nthis entry, §6.5 on this). Although not directly connected with\nthe incompleteness phenomenon, there are indeed several accounts of\nantinomies affecting what appear to be sets of apparently legitimate,\nnatural postulates involving certain epistemic notions. Let Leitgeb\n2021 work as an ultimate example of sources of this sort, presenting a\nsolution to the lottery paradox (see Kyburg 1961 and\n epistemic paradoxes)\n that affects principles relating categorical belief to graded belief\n(see also Douven 2021 that contains the former source). \nIn the final quarter of the last century a host of logical papers\narise from the discussion of the foundations of semantics, with a\nnumber of proposals which generalize or modify Tarski’s\nsemantical conception of truth. Tarski notwithstanding, since 1975 the\nhierarchical approach has been somewhat superseded by new ideas that\nhave rendered the ideal of logical and semantical closure in many\nrespect accessible (especially by means of the fixed point methods\nused by Kripke 1975 and Martin-Woodruff; see Martin 1984). We also\nmention the approach stemming from Herzberger, Gupta and Belnap 1993\n(see the entry\n revision theory of truth),\n that has connections with non-elementary parts of definability\ntheory, set theory and higher recursion theory (Welch 2001, 2009,\n2011, 2019). This has led to the general axiomatic study of\nrevision-theoretic definitions and theories of circular\ndefinitions (see Bruni 2009, 2013b, 2015, 2019). In Standefer\n2015 a connection is established between Solovay type theorem and\ncircular definitions of revision theory and a particular modal logic\nRT (revision theory): a completeness theorem for this logic, analogous\nto Solovay’s completeness theorem for GL, is proven. The modal\nlogic in question is built upon an operator that is naturally\nconnected with revision-theoretic construction (hence, the name), as\nexplained in Gupta and Standefer 2017. The proof theory of this system\nis studied in Standefer 2018. \nRecent advances on revision theory, have contributed to prove the\nfertility of the approach (in a direction related to the last part of\n§6.4 of this entry): Gupta 2011 presents an application to the\nconcept of strategic rationality in a certain type of finite games\nthat is connected to a common way of understanding rational choice in\nstrategic contexts. Although developed independently, Gupta’s\nstance is reminiscent of previous work by H. Gaifman about rationality\nbeing affected by paradoxes resembling the truth theoretic paradoxes\nlike the liar paradox (see Gaifman 1999). An extension of this\napproach to the class of all finite games is presented in Bruni and\nSillari 2018. The notable aspect of Gupta’s application is that\nit makes use of only the finite part of revision theory (i.e., it does\nnot need the transfinite iteration of this construction), and it gets\nrid of the rule for dealing with stages corresponding to limit\nordinals. This limit rule, which is essential to address the concept\nof truth, turned out to be the most critical aspect of the\nrevision-theoretic approach to circular concepts from both the\ncomplexity, and the conceptual point of view (see Campbell-Moore 2019\nfor a recent, new approach to the topic). \nThe wealth and variety of semantical tools has triggered a sort of\nexperimenting with a number of mixed proposals. Refinements\nof revision theory and generalizations thereof can be found in Rivello\n2019a e 2019b where a new approach to a formal theory of truth is\ndeveloped, which implements features of Kripke’s fixed point\ntheory with the Herzberger-Gupta revision theory. An analogous\ncombination, studied from a more proof-theoretic angle, was considered\nin Standefer 2017. Similarly, combinations of the possible worlds\nsemantics for the necessity predicate with Kripke’s\nsupervaluational partial models for the truth predicate are also\nstudied by Nicolai 2018. \nField (2003, 2008) has proposed influential solutions of the\nsemantical paradoxes which combine Kripkean and revision theoretic\ntechniques. According to him, the present solutions to the paradoxes\nare not satisfactory because of the following points: (i) the lack of\na decent conditional (and biconditional); (ii) the failure of (some\ninstances of) the T-schema (A ↔ T(⌈A⌉); (iii) the\nfailure of intersubstitutivity between A and T(⌈A⌉); (iv)\nthe impossibility of providing an internal analysis of the\ndefectiveness of the paradoxical sentences. Field (2008) has\nconsequently developed a theory of truth with a non-classical\nconditional operator, which allows to express a notion of\ndeterminate truth and to state that the Liar is not\ndeterminately true. Analysis of Field’s construction requires\nsophisticated set-theoretic and recursion theoretic\ndevelopments (see Welch 2008, 2009, 2011). Moreover, the\npossibility of logically enriching Kripke’s theory of truth with\nnovel conditionals has opened up new routes: e.g. Rossi\n(2016) provides an interesting method of incorporating a conditional\nconforming to Łukasiewicz three-valued logic in a fixed-point\nconstruction for truth. In the same direction, a considerable\nattention has been directed in recent literature to the so called\nrevenge problem: typical solutions, say, of the Liar paradox,\nrely on notions that, if expressible in the object language, give rise\nto new versions of the paradox. So, the solution is only an illusion.\nThe revenge problem can be instantiated by the so-called Strengthened\nLiar: informally, once we have a model which makes the Liar\nsentence L itself neither true nor false, and we can express this\nvery fact, L is after all not true. But this is the claim made by L,\nand hence L is true. So the paradox seems to show up again (for more\ndetails, see the entry\n liar paradox and\n the collection of essays contained in Beall 2007). \n“Indexical” solutions of the Liar have been developed in\nseveral contributions, e.g., by Burge, Gaifman, Simmons. The idea is\nthat the Liar paradox does not involve sentences, but specific\noccurrences of sentences, i.e., sentence tokens (this idea is to\nbe found already in scholastic solutions). For the sake of historical\naccuracy, let us mention that in 1913 Lesniewski, later Tarski’s\ndissertation advisor, had already advanced an indexical\nnominalistically inspired solution of the Liar in his paper A\nCritique of the Logical Principle of the Excluded Middle (see\nBetti 2004). \nBesides the model-theoretic side, axiomatic investigations of\ntruth and related paradoxes have become increasingly important\nsince the seminal papers of Friedman and Sheard 1987, Feferman 1991.\nSince the year 2000, this research thread has been intensively studied\nwith various aims, from proof-theoretic analysis to\nphilosophical discussion of minimalism (for a survey of the\nvarieties of truth theoretic systems and appropriate references, see\nthe entry on\n axiomatic theories of truth and\n the recent monographs of Halbach 2011, Horsten 2011; see also the\npapers Feferman 2008, Fujimoto 2010, Leigh and Rathjen 2010). \nLast but not least, the axiomatic study of epistemic notions has\ngreatly benefited from application of techniques used for proving\nincompleteness and indefinability results since the early sixties:\nthey have yielded negative results (Kaplan and Montague 1960, Montague\n1963, Thomason 1980) and established an interesting link with the\nsurprise test paradox. The situation may have also been changed by the\nstudy of possible world semantics for modal notions, conceived as\npredicates in Halbach, Leitgeb and Welch 2003. However this\nis open to debate and experimentation: for instance it is argued in\nHalbach and Welch 2009 that the predicate approach to necessity is a\nviable route — insofar as the expressive power is considered\n— provided one resorts to languages that involve both a\ntruth predicate and the necessity operator. \nA number of solutions have been proposed, which rely on the use of\nparaconsistent logics (Priest) or substructural logics (see the entry\n logic: paraconsistent,\n as well as the entry\n substructural logics and\n Mares and Paoli 2014). \nThe investigation of semantical and set-theoretic paradoxes in\ninfinite-valued logic—which was pioneered by Mow Shaw-Kwei 1954\nand Skolem in 1957 — has received a new impulse by contributions\nby Hajek, Shepherdson and Paris 2000, and Hajek 2005, 2010. Typically,\nin these papers basic results from mathematical analysis are\napplied (e.g. Brouwer’s fixed point theorem). It is worth\nmentioning that Leitgeb 2008 has given a consistency proof for a\nprobabilistic theory of truth with unrestricted T-schema by\nmaking use of the Hahn-Banach Theorem. A follow-up of the latter\nsource that connects with researches related to the revision theory\n(see §6.5), is Campbell-Moore, Horsten and Leitgeb 2019. \nTheories of naive truth—as based on the unrestricted\nbiconditional and on a logic without contraction—are to be found\nin the literature, e.g see Cantini 2002, Zardini 2011, Bacon 2013,\nStandefer 2016. Ripley 2012, instead, presents an alternative approach\nbased on a non-transitive logical system (see also Cobreros et al.\n2012, as well as Cobreros et al. 2015, which attempts at extending the\napproach to the paradoxes of vagueness). \nGrišin 1981 proved that the system based upon the paradoxical\nprinciple par excellence—the uniform naïve\ncomprehension schema—and (some form of) non-contractive logic\nenjoys cut elimination, and hence is consistent. On the other hand,\nthe consistency of the system is ruined by extensionality and this\ncould be counted as an additional paradox! Of course\n‘uniform’ here means that a variable-binding abstraction\noperator {x | φ(x,a)} for naming the\nset defined by φ, depending on a list of given parameters\na, is available. Interestingly, it has been shown that\nclosely related systems have unexpected applications to the\ncharacterization of complexity classes (Girard 1998, Terui 2004); on\nthe other hand, the system is computationally complete (it\ncan interpret combinatory logic, Cantini 2003). \nBesides tools from algebra and analysis, logical investigations about\nparadoxes have recently applied graph theory (see Cook 2004, Rabern,\nRabern and Macauley 2013, Beringer and Schindler 2017, Hsiung 2017): a\nbasic idea is the attempt to grasp in geometric terms the patterns\nof paradox, their structural features. For instance, one\ncan assign a reference graph (rfg) to sentences of the\nlanguage of arithmetic with truth via Leitgeb’s notion of\ndependence (Leitgeb 2005). It is further conjectured that a solution\nto the characterization problem for dangerous rfgs amounts to the\nclaim that basically the Liar- and the Yablo graph are the only\nparadoxical rfgs. This route is independently developed in Rossi\n2019 by exploring the wide range of semantic behaviours displayed by\nparadoxical sentences, and providing a unified theory of truth and\nparadox. The result is a theory of truth that yields a threefold\nclassification of paradoxical sentences (liar-like sentences,\ntruth-teller-like sentences, and revenge sentences), and proposes a\nway of interpreting all three kinds, as well as paradox-free\nsentences, within a single model, where the basic tool is a notion of\n“semantic graph”. In Hsiung 2020, instead, Leitgeb’s\napproach is combined with the one of Beringer and Schindler 2017 to\nstudy a type of paradoxes of finitary characteristic, which is defined\nin terms of Leitgeb’s dependence relation itself.","contact.mail":"andrea.cantini@unifi.it","contact.domain":"unifi.it"},{"date.published":"2007-10-16","date.changed":"2021-04-20","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradoxes-contemporary-logic/","author1":"Andrea Cantini","author1.info":"https://unifi.academia.edu/RiccardoBruni","entry":"paradoxes-contemporary-logic","body.text":"\n\n\nBy “paradox” one usually means a statement claiming\nsomething which goes beyond (or even against) ‘common\nopinion’ (what is usually believed or held). Paradoxes form a\nnatural object of philosophical investigation ever since the origins\nof rational thought; they have been invented as part of complex\narguments and as tools for refuting philosophical theses (think of the\ncelebrated paradoxes credited to Zeno of Elea, concerning motion, the\ncontinuum, the opposition between unity and plurality, or of the\narguments entangling the notions of truth and vagueness, credited to\nthe Megarian School, and Eubulides of Miletus). Paradoxes—termed\nas Insolubilia—form also a substantial part of logical\nand philosophical investigations during the Middle Ages.\n\n\nThis entry concentrates on the emergence of non-trivial logical themes\nand notions from the discussion on paradoxes from the beginning of the\n20th century until 1945, and attempts to assess their importance for\nthe development of contemporary logic. Paradoxes involving\n vagueness,\n knowledge,\n belief,\n and\n space and time\n are treated in separate entries.\n\n\nA terminological warning is in order. The word “antinomy”\nis used below as alternative to, and synonymous with,\n“paradox”. Most paradoxes—but not all—involve\ncontradictions; for such cases, we often use the word\n“contradiction” as well.\n\nBetween the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th\ncentury, the foundations of logic and mathematics were affected by the\ndiscovery of a number of difficulties—the so-called\nparadoxes—involving fundamental notions and basic methods of\ndefinition and inference, which were usually accepted as\nunproblematic. Since then paradoxes have acquired a new role in\ncontemporary logic: indeed, they have led to theorems (usually\nnegative results, such as unprovability and undecidability) and they\nare not simply confined to the realm of a sterile dialectic. Several\nbasic notions of logic, as it is presently taught, have reached their\npresent shape at the end of a process which has been often triggered\nby various attempts to solve paradoxes. This is especially true for\nthe notions of set and collection in general, for\nthe basic syntactical and semantical concepts of standard\nclassical logic (logical languages of a given order, the notion\nof satisfiability, definability). After the first forty years, the\nby-products of the paradoxes included axiomatizations of set theory, a\nsystematic development of type theory, the foundations of semantics, a\ntheory of formal systems (at least in nuce), besides the\nintroduction of the dichotomy predicative/impredicative which\nwas important for conceptual reasons, but also for the future of proof\ntheoretical methods. \nEarly work on paradoxes of particular importance pertained to the\nfollowing notions: \nSome of these contradictions are already treated as separate entries\nin this encyclopedia\n (liar paradox,\n Russell’s paradox); the emphasis here will be on the background problems,\ntheir mutual links and the interaction with foundational and\nphilosophical issues. \nThe earliest modern paradoxes concerned the notions of ordinal and\ncardinal number. Burali-Forti, a mathematician of Peano’s\nschool, attempted to prove that the ordinal numbers are not linearly\nordered. Assuming by contradiction that the class \\(\\mathbf{ON}\\) of\nall ordinals could be linearly ordered, he observed that then\n\\(\\mathbf{ON}\\) itself would be well-ordered and it would possess an\nordinal \\(\\Omega \\in \\mathbf{ON}\\). Thus \\(\\mathbf{ON}\\) would be\nsimilar (order-isomorphic) to a proper initial segment of itself, the\none determined by \\(\\Omega\\), contradicting a well-known theorem about\nwell-ordered sets. The result was published in 1897 and, though\nBurali-Forti’s original aim is impossible to achieve, his\nargument showed that the collection \\(\\mathbf{ON}\\) is problematic at\nbest (Moore-Garciadiego 1981). \nThe father of set theory, Cantor, had noticed similar difficulties\nalready in 1895 (as witnessed by Bernstein and by letters to Hilbert\nand Dedekind). Indeed, in a second letter to Dedekind of August 31,\n1899 Cantor pointed out another problem, involving the notion of the\ncardinal number and implying that one cannot consistently think of the\n“the set of all conceivable sets”, say \\(M\\). Were \\(M\\) a\ngenuine set, then it would possess a cardinal number \\(m\\), which\nwould be the maximum cardinal number. But one could also consider the\nset \\(\\wp(M)\\) of all subsets of \\(M\\), and by Cantor’s theorem\nthe cardinality of \\(\\wp(M)\\) ought to be strictly bigger than the\npurported maximum \\(m\\): contradiction. \nAs a consequence, Cantor suggested a crucial distinction—still\nregarded as “subjective”, i.e., mathematically not\nprecise, by Hilbert (as late as 1904, see van Heijenoort 1967, p.\n131)—between totalities that cannot be conceived as a whole (the\ninconsistent ones) and those which can be regarded as\ncompleted (fertige Menge). Roughly, the former is a\ncollection that cannot be an element of other collections, whereas the\nlatter is a small collection, which can be an element of other\ncollections (see also the entry on\n the early development of set theory).\n This corresponds to the distinction between classes and\nsets, later made precise and axiomatized in the\nclass-theoretic approach (von Neumann, Bernays, Gödel); it is\nreminiscent of the Russellian limitation-of-size doctrine (see\n 3.1\n below; Garciadiego 1992). \nIn the case of the difficulty discovered by Burali-Forti, the\nconsequence for Cantor was that the multiplicity\n(Mannigfaltigkeit) of ordinal numbers is itself well-ordered,\nbut is not a set: hence, no ordinal can be assigned to it, and the\nantinomy is resolved. \nThe second famous published antinomy (Russell 1903, paragraphs 78,\n101–106; Frege 1903, Appendix, dated October 1902; see the entry\n Russell’s paradox\n and Klement 2010) takes us from Cantor’s paradise into the\nrealm of the foundations of logic and the philosophy of mathematics.\nIt is strikingly simple, involves only predicate application, and it\nhas an explicit self-referential (reflexive) character. In\nRussell’s own words (June 16, 1902, letter to Frege, translation\nin van Heijenoort 1963, pp. 124–125), \nRussell was at first entangled in the study of “the\ncontradictions in the relation of continuous quantity to number and\nthe continuum” (cited in Moore 1995, p. 219), and he obtained\nhis contradiction (May 1901) as a result of considering the antinomy\narising with Cantor’s theorem (see Russell 1903, footnote 7,\npar. 344; par. 100, p. 101). Russell probably realized the importance\nof the discovery only after Frege’s reply. The effect of the\nantinomy is that it is impossible to have an abstraction operation\n\\(\\phi \\mapsto \\{x \\mid \\phi \\}\\) mapping injectively any concept\n(property) \\(\\phi\\) into its extension (the class of all \\(x\\) such\nthat \\(\\phi(x))\\) (i.e., so that if the classes defined by \\(\\phi\\)\nand \\(\\psi\\) are equal, then \\(\\phi(a)\\leftrightarrow \\psi(a)\\), for\nevery object \\(a)\\). As a consequence, it is also impossible to lay\nout the foundations of set theory on a pure logical notion of\nset where membership faithfully mirrors predicate application, in\nthe sense that, in the light of Frege, \\(x \\in y\\) means that (1) \\(y\n= \\{x \\mid \\phi(x)\\}\\) for some concept \\(\\phi\\), and (2) \\(\\phi\\)\ntruly applies to \\(x\\). (For historical details on Russell’s\ndiscovery of the paradox, see Moore 1995). \nRussell’s Principles of Mathematics (1903) contains\nextended discussions of Russell’s and Burali-Forti’s\nparadoxes in various forms in the sections 78, 84–85, 101, 301.\nRussell’s paradox is adapted to show that a propositional\nfunction \\(\\phi\\) cannot be a logical subject (i.e., as separated from\nits argument; it is not saturated in Frege’s terms);\notherwise, \\(\\phi\\) would apply to itself, \\(\\neg \\phi(\\phi)\\) would\nbe a propositional function and it would be possible to reproduce the\ninconsistency. \nIn ch. 10, section 102, Russell also gives a form of Cantor’s\ntheorem, which captures the logical essence of diagonalization (this\nversion is by now folklore): no binary relation can parameterize all\nunary predicates over a given domain \\(U\\) (i.e., no binary relation\n\\(R\\) exists such that for all unary predicates \\(P\\) over \\(U\\),\nthere is an object \\(a\\) in \\(U\\) for which one has: for all \\(x\\) in\n\\(U, R(a, x) \\leftrightarrow P(x))\\). \nIn sum, Russell’s contradiction shows the critical status of\napparently safe logical principles: either one has to give up the\nassumption that “any propositional function containing only one\nvariable is equivalent to asserting membership for a class defined by\nthe propositional function” (i.e., the comprehension principle);\nor one has to reject the idea that “every class can be taken as\none term” (pp. 102–103). \nIn Russell’s hands the paradox applies to predicates, classes,\nand propositional functions and leads to a new picture of the\nlogico-mathematical universe, which is outlined in a first exposition\nof the doctrine of types: to each propositional function \\(\\phi\\) is\nassociated a range of significance, i.e., a class of objects\nto which the given \\(\\phi\\) applies in order to produce a proposition;\nmoreover, precisely the ranges of significance form types. However,\nthere are objects that are not ranges of significance; these are just\natoms (i.e., urelemente or individuals) and they form the\nlowest type. The next type consists of classes or ranges of\nindividuals; then one has classes of classes of objects of the lowest\ntype, and so on (see also the entry on\n type theory).. \nNew difficulties still arise if one accepts that propositions form a\ntype (as they are the only objects of which it can be meaningfully\nasserted that they are true or false). First of all, there are\nobviously at least as many propositions as objects (just consider the\nmap associating with \\(x\\) the proposition expressed by \\((x = x)\\);\np. 527). On the other hand, if it is possible to form types of\npropositions, there are more types of propositions than propositions,\nby Cantor’s argument. Then we can inject types of propositions\ninto propositions by means of the notion of logical product.\nLet \\(m\\) be a class of propositions and let \\(\\Pi m\\) be the\nproposition “every proposition of \\(m\\) is true” (regarded\nas a possibly infinitary conjunction); then, if \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are\ndifferent classes, the propositions \\(\\Pi m\\) and \\(\\Pi n\\) are\ndifferent, i.e., the map associating to \\(m\\) its product \\(\\Pi m\\) is\ninjective. Therefore, if we consider the class \nwe have, by injectivity, a contradiction. \nOf course, if one were to adopt the extensional point of view, and\nhence identify equivalent propositions, the contradiction above could\nnot be derived. Russell, however, sticks to an intensional point of\nview, stressing that equivalent propositions often can be quite\ndifferent. So one is apparently forced to reject the assumption that\npropositions form one type, and hence to require that they\nought to have various types, while logical products ought to\nhave propositions of only one type as factors. \nThis was eventually the basis of the ramified theory of types, but in\n1903 Russell still regarded the suggestion as harsh and artificial. As\nthe footnote on p. 527 shows, he believed that the set of all\npropositions is a counterexample to Cantor’s theorem. \nZermelo independently discovered Russell’s paradox in\nGöttingen (as witnessed by Hilbert and Husserl) in the following\nform: a set \\(M\\) that comprises as elements all of its subsets is\ninconsistent. Indeed, consider the set \\(M_0\\) of all elements of\n\\(M\\) which are not elements of themselves (e.g., the empty set is in\n\\(M_0)\\). This set is a subset of \\(M\\) and hence by assumption on\n\\(M, M_0 \\in M\\). If \\(M_0 \\in M_0\\), then \\(M_0\\) is not a member of\nitself. Hence \\(M_0 \\not\\in M_0\\) and since \\(M_0 \\in M, M_0 \\in\nM_0\\): contradiction. \nIn addition, Hilbert had noticed in unpublished work (see Kahle and\nPeckhaus 2002) that additional contradictions of a mathematical nature\ncan arise. The first one derives from assuming that there is a\nwell-defined set \\(C\\) which satisfies the following closure\nconditions: (i) the set \\(N\\) of natural numbers is an element of\n\\(C\\); (ii) \\(X^X \\in C\\), whenever \\(X \\in C\\) (where \\(X^X\\) is the\nset of all functions from \\(X\\) to \\(X)\\); (iii) \\(\\cup X \\in C\\),\nwhenever \\(X \\subseteq C\\). Then by (iii), \\(\\cup C = U \\in C\\) and\nfinally \\(F = U^U \\in C\\). But by definition of union, \\(F \\subseteq\nU\\); hence there would exist a map of \\(U\\) onto \\(F\\) and a\ncontradiction could be derived by diagonalization. \nFurthermore, as is witnessed by Hilbert’s unpublished Sommer\nVorlesung 1905 (see Kahle 2004), Hilbert discovered a remarkable\nfunctional version of Russell’s paradox, later to become popular\nin the context of combinatory logic, lambda calculus and recursion\ntheory. The argument is based on functional self-application\nand hence direct self-reference. \nThe contradiction is obtained by assuming that the universe includes\neverything, i.e., variables range over both objects and functions, and\nthat there are at least two distinct objects. Then one introduces a\nnew operation (universal application in our sense): \\(xy\\) is the\nresult of applying \\(x\\) to \\(y\\). Given two distinct objects 0 and 1,\nand on the assumption that the universe is closed under arbitrary\ndefinition by cases, there exists an object \\(f\\) such that \\(fx =\n0\\), if \\(xx \\ne 0\\), and \\(fx = 1\\), if \\(xx = 0\\). Then one chooses\n\\(x = f\\) (as \\(x\\) ranges over everything) and easily derives a\ncontradiction. \nThe results of the Hilbert school were not published because\ncontradictions and paradoxes were regarded as symptoms of growth and\nas temporary difficulties. The diagnosis was that traditional logic is\ninsufficient and the theory of concept-formation needs to be\nsharpened. Any concept \\(C\\) is given in a network of concepts (letter\nof Hilbert to Frege, Dec. 27, 1899; see Frege 1976, pp. 79–80),\nand this network is determined by the axioms. Only the consistency of\nthe axioms that define the concept guarantees the legitimacy of \\(C\\).\nIn a nutshell: paradoxes tell us that we must develop a\nmetamathematical analysis of the notions of proof and of the axiomatic\nmethod; their importance is methodological as well as\nepistemological. \nAs the reactions of the mathematical world made clear, the paradoxes\nwere crucially involved around 1905 when basic problems of set theory\nwere worked on. Indeed, the new contradictions not only affected the\nconception of set and logical concepts, they also came to include the\nnotion of definability and its relation with a fundamental\nissue: the structure of the mathematical continuum and in particular\nwhether the continuum can be well-ordered and whether Cantor’s\nContinuum Hypothesis (CH) holds. \nAt the Heidelberg Congress in 1904, Julius König tried to refute\nCantor’s continuum hypothesis. Due to a mistake discovered by\nZermelo, his paper was immediately withdrawn, but the subsequent year,\nKönig produced a new argument. \nConsider the reals which are definable in finitely many\nwords. They form a countable sequence: \\(E_0, \\ldots,\nE_n,\\ldots\\). Since the continuum is uncountable, there exist reals\nnot occurring in the given enumeration. Assuming that the continuum is\nwell-ordered, there exists “the least real \\(E\\) which is not in\nthe sequence \\(\\{E_n \\mid n \\in \\Omega \\}\\)”; this real is not\nin the sequence, but the very expression “the least real \\(E\\)\nwhich is not in the sequence” defines \\(E\\) with finitely\nmany words; so \\(E\\) occurs somewhere in the sequence:\ncontradiction! \nKönig also observed that the argument extends to the second\nnumber class and a similar paradox could be obtained by considering\nthe collection \\(\\mathbf{FOD}\\) of finitely definable countable\nordinals. In this case, taking inspiration from Cantor,\nKönig’s solution is that Cantor’s second number class\nis not a set in a proper sense (a completed totality). To define a\nset, according to König, one should provide not only a rule for\ndefining its elements, but also a means for distinguishing them. \nA contradiction related to König’s had been published\nslightly earlier by Jules Richard, a mathematician of a Lyceé\nin Dijon. Using an enumeration of all permutations with repetitions of\nthe twenty-six letters of the French alphabet, Richard noticed that\nthe set \\(E\\) of reals that can be defined by finitely many French\nwords is denumerable and hence one can assume to have an enumeration\n\\(u_1, u_2,\\ldots\\) of all those numbers. But then one can define the\nfollowing real \\(N\\): the integer part of \\(N\\) is 0, while its\n\\(n\\)th decimal digit of \\(N\\) is \\(p+1\\) if \\(u_n\\) has the \\(n\\)th\ndecimal digit \\(p\\) different from both 8 and 9; otherwise, the\n\\(n\\)th decimal digit of \\(N\\) is 1. By construction, \\(N\\) will not\noccur in \\(u_1, u_2,\\ldots\\). On the other hand, if we consider that\n\\(N\\) is defined by means of a finite collection of letters, this must\noccur in \\(u_1, u_2,\\ldots\\). \nContrary to König, Richard did not rely upon the well-ordering of\nthe continuum, and the proposed solution is interesting for the\nfoundational debate to come. He pointed out that the definition of the\nnumber \\(N\\) refers to the totality of definable reals, to which \\(N\\)\nitself belong; but no object should be definable in terms of a\ncollection containing it. So it appears that the definition is\nviciously circular, and that makes the definition illusory. This idea\nsoon became the basis of Poincaré’s solution, and\neventually also Russell’s (see below\n 3.1,\n the issue of impredicatively defined collections). \nSo, why definability? The motivation was made clear for instance by\nBernstein’s “Die Theorie der reellen Zahlen”\n(1905a), where Cantor’s continuum hypothesis was claimed to be\nsettled in the positive. He criticized the so called “Dirichlet\nnotion” of arbitrary function and stated that it is possible to\ngive a foundation to the continuum using only computable reals, i.e.,\nreals possessing an explicit “formation law”\n(“Bildungsgesetz”). \nAccording to him, this is not a restriction since—he\nclaims—there are nondenumerably many computable reals in his\nsense. He also states that it is possible to display the new\ncomputable continuum in a hierarchy (i.e., a \\(\\subset\\)-increasing\nsequence) \\(\\{B_{\\alpha} \\mid \\alpha \\lt \\aleph_1\\}\\) of subsets of\n\\(N^N\\), which is defined in such a way that each \\(B_{\\alpha}\\) is at\nmost of cardinality \\(\\aleph_1\\) and hence that the cardinality of the\nunion of the sequence is at most \\(\\aleph_1\\). The idea is to start\nwith a basic domain \\(B_0 \\subset N^N\\) of simple functions (e.g.,\nthose having finitely many values), then to define a new domain\n\\(B_1\\) which extends \\(B_0\\) with operations that are defined from\nelements of \\(B_0\\), and so on. \nThough his claims are not justified, in the light of\nGödel’s later work on constructibility, one might say that\nBernstein’s basic intuition was sound: the continuum problem can\nbe settled, if one has an appropriately general notion of definability\n(or computability, constructibility) and by iterating it along the\nordinals. \nThis question was ultimately connected with the problem of\nunderstanding the atomistic continuum. The arithmetized\nconception—in the sense of Dedekind or Cantor, where real\nnumbers are identified with suitable sets of rationals—shifted\nthe attention towards arbitrary infinite sequences of natural\nnumbers. But this notion was not so easy to accept. According to\nBernstein (Bernstein 1905a, p. 449), an infinite sequence (or an\ninfinite set) must be given by a genuine rule. But what is a\nrule? Since one must be liberal (in order not to have just\nspecial classes of reals, if one is too restrictive), one is naturally\ndriven to think of arbitrary finitely described laws, shifting the\nattention towards the syntax of the rules. However, unless\none considers ordinary language, no such syntax is available and this\nengenders indeterminacy (this is Peano’s diagnosis, see below\nPeano 1902–1906). \nThe need for a specification of infinite sets is crucial in the\ndiscussion of the related well-ordering problem. It also affects the\nrelated issue of the classification of discontinuous functions and\nanalytically representable functions of real variables, tackled by the\nFrench semi-intuitionists Borel, Baire and Lebesgue. At the same time,\nthey held the view that a mathematical entity (like an infinite set or\na function) exists only insofar as it is “nameable by a finite\nnumber of words”, against the platonistic views of Hadamard and\nZermelo (see Borel et al. 1905). \nIn the light of the foundational debate, the following years were rich\nin seminal work: new paradoxes were discovered (Berry,\nGrelling-Nelson), an old paradox—the Liar—showed up again,\na comprehensive view of the contradictions of logic and mathematics\nwas masterfully outlined in the opening section of Russell’s\n1908 paper and the preceding Russell 1906a, while a conceptual\ndistinction between two kinds of paradoxes was set forth in\nPeano’s paper of 1906. Also, the basic ideas of predicativity\nemerged in the discussion between Poincaré, the leading\nmathematician of the time, and Russell. Even more important for the\nhistory of mathematical logic, fundamental technical advances for\nsolving the paradoxes and shaping the foundations of logic and\nmathematics were made: Russell’s theory of (ramified) types and\nZermelo’s axiomatization of set theory. \nRussell’s and Poincaré’s ideas for solving\nparadoxes are to be found in a number of papers published in the\nperiod 1905–1912: \nPoincaré (1906b) took the contradictions as grounds to defend\nan intuitionistic, Kantian point of view. According to him,\nnumber-theoretic induction and the axiom of choice constitute\nindependent intuitions, truly synthetic a priori judgements. He then\nargues against Russell’s logical definition of natural numbers\nas those numbers which belong to all recurrent classes (those\nclasses which contain 0 and are closed under successor). His objection\nis that the definition is not admissible since it refers essentially\nto a totality to which the class to be defined belongs—the\ndefinition is impredicative—and hence it is to be\nregarded as circular. But, according to Poincaré,\nmathematical objects do not exist without a proper\ndefinition, and a proper definition must be predicative,\ni.e., it must avoid vicious circles; Poincaré thus\nsomewhat extended Richard’s diagnosis. \nPoincaré’s views evolved over the years and in the debate\nwith Russell. In the later period, he advanced a novel approach to\npredicativity, which, though informally sketched, is suggestive of\nlater developments in definability and proof theory (see Feferman\n1964, Heinzmann 1985). He no longer insisted on the vicious\ncircularity of the definition involved in the contradictions; instead,\nhe held the view that a predicative classification is\ncharacterized by invariance, i.e., that it cannot be affected by\nthe introduction of new elements; by contrast, impredicative notions\nare subject to constant modification whenever new elements are\nintroduced. \nIn the light of contemporary logic, Poincaré is hinting at some\nform of absoluteness or invariance under extension (that will\nbe made precise by Kreisel 1960 via model theory and recursion\ntheory): his ideas will inspire the non-ramified approach to the\nfoundations of predicative analysis. \nIn his last contribution to Acta Mathematica (1909) and in\nhis fifth Göttingen lecture (1910), he also gave a restatement of\nRichard’s paradox, as a refinement of Cantor’s theorem, in\nthe form: “there is no definable enumeration of definable\nreals”. \nWhile mathematicians and Poincaré himself focused on the\nproblems raised by the contradictions insofar as they involved the\nfoundations of specific mathematical notions (the continuum, the\nnatural numbers, the theory of cardinal and ordinal numbers), Russell\ndirectly attacked the comprehension principle, that is, the\nassumption that certain propositional functions determine a class (see\nalso\n 2.3\n above). The paradoxes prove that a propositional function may be\nwell-defined for every argument, and yet the collection of the values\nfor which it is defined need not be a class. So the crucial\nproblem becomes logical: to give a criterion for selecting those\npropositional functions which give rise to classes (understood as\nwell-defined objects). \nUnder the influence of Poincaré, Russell (1906, p. 634)\naccepted the vicious circle principle, for which he used a\nformulation in the terminology and adopting the notions of formal\nlogic as formulated by Peano: \nIn logical terms, we are not allowed to quantify over a given class\n\\(X\\) when defining an element of \\(X\\) itself (see also the entry on\n definitions). \nOf course, the vicious circle principle is not itself a theory, but a\ncondition any adequate theory has to satisfy. Russell (1906, 1907)\ntentatively proposed three alternative approaches: the zigzag theory,\nthe theory of limitation of size, and the no-classes theory. The\nzigzag theory attempts to capture the idea that the right functions\nought to be ‘simple’, while according to the second view,\n‘predicative’ would be characterized by a certain\nlimitation of the size of classes which can be predicatively defined\n(e.g., the collection of all ordinals \\(\\mathbf{ON}\\) is too large).\nIn the no-classes theory, classes are not independent entities and\nanything said about them is to be regarded as an abbreviation of a\nstatement about their members and the propositional functions defining\nthem. This is not far from Poincaré’s idea that\nmathematical objects should be specified in finitely many words.\nHowever, Russell developed his own technical devices—such as the\n‘substitution method’ (Landini 1998), and the contextual\nelimination of definite descriptions (see the entry\n Russell)\n – in order to implement his ideas. \nIn contrast to Poincaré, Russell 1906 did not consider the\nactual infinite as an essential component of the foundational malaise,\nand he stressed that contradictions arise even if the infinite is not\ninvolved. This is clearly shown by the Liar paradox in the form\n‘I am lying’. As far as we know, it is exactly at this\npoint in time that the (probably) most cited semantical puzzle in the\nhistory of logic regains a conspicuous position in logical\nanalysis. \nIn his analysis of the Liar paradox, Russell assumed that there exists\na true entity—the proposition—that is presupposed by a\ngenuine statement (e.g., when I say that Socrates is mortal, there is\na fact corresponding to my assertion and it is this fact that is\ncalled ‘proposition’). The same holds if the statement is\nfalse, but not in the case where the statement itself contains\nquantified variables. \nThe paradox is then solved by construing the Liar as ‘there is a\nproposition that I state and that is false’; hence the statement\ncontains a quantification (hence an apparent variable) over the\ncollection of all propositions, and it is not a proposition in a\nproper sense (Russell 1906, 642–644). So the conclusion is that\nthe Liar is false because it does not state a proposition. \nSimilar considerations apply to the paradox suggested by\nBerry, which is briefly stated in Russell 1906 for the first time\nin published form, and has the merit of not going beyond the domain of\nfinite numbers. \nConsider the natural numbers that are definable by means of less than\n18 syllables: this set is non-empty and finite. So there exist numbers\nwhich are not definable using less than 18 syllables. Consider the\nleast such number: clearly, by definition, it is not definable with\nless than 18 syllables. \nOn the other hand such a number is definable with less than 18\nsyllables, since it is uniquely determined by the expression\n“the least number not definable with less than 18\nsyllables”, which itself has less than 18 syllables. \nFor the sake of historical accuracy, we should remark that Beppo Levi,\nwho made an articulated contribution to the debate on the axiom of\nchoice in the first two decades of the 1900s, outlined an antinomy\nwhich is essentially a variant of Berry’s paradox in the context\nof discussing Richard’s paradox (see Levi 1908, and also Lolli\n2007 and Bruni 2013 for further comments about Levi’s approach\nto paradoxes). \nThe Russellian theory of types is widely known and investigated in the\nliterature (see the entries on\n type theory\n and\n Bertrand Russell):\n it is of current interest and has descendants in logic and its\napplications. It was first developed by Russell in the fundamental\nmemoir Mathematical Logic as based on the theory of types of\n1908. \nThe doctrine of types is based upon the observation that universal\nquantification—understood as full generality, i.e., when \\(x\\)\nranges ‘over the whole universe’—does not make\nsense: when we state that \\(\\forall x\\phi(x)\\) is true, we only claim\nthe function \\(\\phi(x)\\) has the value ‘true’ for all\narguments \\(x\\) for which it is meaningful. The essential\npoint is that each propositional function has a range of significance,\ni.e., a type, and quantification is legitimate only over\ntypes. Formally speaking, each variable must have a preassigned\ntype. The paradoxes (or reflexive fallacies) prove that certain\ncollections, such as the totality of all propositions, of all classes\nand so on, cannot be types. So we can quantify over the collection of\nmen, but we cannot properly state ‘all propositions of the form\n\\(p\\vee \\neg p\\) are true’. Therefore, the logical entities\ndivide into types, and, in particular, every propositional\nfunction must have a higher type than its arguments. Moreover, in\nthe light of the vicious circle principle, the notion of\norder must also be introduced. No object can be defined by\nquantifying over a totality which contains the object itself as\nelement; hence the order of every propositional function must be\ngreater than the order of propositional functions over which it\nquantifies. \nThe main idea is clarified in Russell 1908 (pp. 163–164) by\nconsidering how propositions can be arranged into a suitable\n“ramified” hierarchy, according to their order and so as\nto satisfy the vicious circle principle. First of all, there are\nelementary propositions, i.e., those containing no bound variables at\nall, while the lowest type consists of individuals.\nIndividuals are entities without logical structure and can be regarded\nas the subjects of elementary propositions. The second logical type\nembraces the first order propositions, i.e., those whose\nquantifiers (if any) range only over individuals. Quantification over\nfirst order propositions gives rise to a new type, consisting exactly\nof second order propositions. In general, the \\((n + 1)\\)th\nlogical type comprises propositions of order \\(n\\), which contain\nquantification only up to the \\((n – 1)\\)th order. \nSince a propositional function can be obtained from a proposition\n‘by treating one or more of its constituents as\nvariables’, the hierarchy of types and orders is naturally\nlifted to propositional functions, and it makes sense to speak of\norder of a function, its order being roughly the order of the\nvalue (i.e., a proposition) which the function assumes when it is\napplied to an argument for which it makes sense. So, for instance, a\nfunction which applies to individuals and takes first-order\npropositions as values is first-order. \nFollowing the doctrine of types, we must replace ‘all\npropositions’ by ‘all propositions of order \\(n\\)’\nfor a given \\(n\\). Hence the Liar sentence becomes “it is not\ntrue of all propositions \\(p\\) of order \\(n\\), that if I affirm \\(p,\np\\) is true”, which is a proposition of order \\(n + 1\\). Then\nthe Liar is simply false rather than contradictory; and this solves\nthe paradox. Similar arguments solve the other paradoxes. \nIn this theory, predicative functions of one argument, i.e.,\nthose having as order the successor of the order of their argument,\nplay a crucial role. For instance, a predicative function of an\nindividual variable must have order 1 (in current terminology, it is\nelementarily definable and quantifies only over individuals).\nThe axiom of reducibility (AR) states that every\npropositional function is equivalent, for all its values, to a\npredicative function of the same variables. So, for instance, we\nmight have a definition of a property \\(P(n)\\) of natural numbers\n(regarded as individuals) which quantifies over, say, second-order\npropositions. But AR implies that there exists a function \\(P^* (n)\\)\nwhich is satisfied by exactly the same numbers as \\(P(n)\\) and is\npredicative, i.e., it involves quantification only on\nnumbers. \nThus, according to the axiom of reducibility, statements about\narbitrary functions can be replaced by statements about predicative\nfunctions; and predicative functions play the role of classes, i.e.,\ncanonical representatives of arbitrary complex concepts (e.g., among\nthe possible properties of different order which have the same\nextension as \\(P(n)\\), \\(P^*(n)\\) canonically represents the class of\nnumbers satisfying \\(P(n))\\). \nBesides the axiom of infinity, AR is an essential tool for\nreconstructing classical mathematics, but it is a strong existential\nprinciple, apparently in conflict with the philosophical idea that\nlogical and mathematical entities are to be constructively generated\naccording to the vicious circle principle. Nonetheless, it was adopted\nin the (first edition of the) monumental Principia\nMathematica, written in collaboration with A.N. Whitehead and\npublished in 1910 (vol. 1), 1912 (vol. 2) and 1913 (vol. 3). \nInterestingly, the basic idea underlying Russell’s ramified\nhierarchy of types is a crucial ingredient in Gödel’s later\nconsistency proof of the continuum hypothesis via its inner model\n\\(L\\) of constructible sets. Also, as already observed in Gödel\n(1944), a form of AR becomes true in \\(L\\) in the sense that, roughly,\nan arbitrary propositional function of natural numbers is\nextensionally equivalent to some function of order \\(\\alpha\\), for\nsome countable ordinal \\(\\alpha\\) (see the entry\n Kurt Gödel).\n Other important applications of ramified hierarchies have been given\nsince the late fifties in different fields (from recursion theory to\nproof theory; see the entry on\n type theory). \nThere is a sizeable literature on paradoxes already in the early years\nof the 20th century, which is not at all exhausted by the\nprevious discussion. Refinements and variations of foundational and\nlogical interest are to be found in the works of several authors,\nincluding prominent mathematicians, among them Peano, Borel,\nSchönflies, Brouwer, and Weyl. Some of the more stimulating and\noriginal proposals are surveyed in the rest of this section. \nPeano’s criticism (in Additione a Super Theorema de\nCantor-Bernstein) of Richard’s paradox is mainly known\nbecause it points out that “Richard’s example pertains\nto linguistics, not to mathematics” and this statement\nopens up the distinction between set-theoretic or mathematical\nantinomies and semantical antinomies: the weak point in\nRichard’s definition is that to some extent it is symbolic and\nformal, but it also makes use of the natural language\n(“lingua commune”); this contains ideas that are\nquite familiar but nevertheless are not sharply defined and are\nambiguous (Peano 1906, p. 357–358). For instance, there is no\nprecise criterion for deciding whether a given expression of the\nnatural language represents a rule uniquely defining a number. \nIn spite of that, Peano elaborated a formal solution. He tried to get\nrid of vagueness and reference to \\(E\\), the set of finitely definable\nreals in the unit interval, by fixing an explicit\n“Gödel-numbering”: given a natural number \\(n\\),\nwrite \\(n\\) in base \\(B\\), for sufficiently large \\(B\\) (so as to\ninclude the number of alphabet letters plus punctuation marks). Then\neach number is assigned a finite string of symbols in the natural\nlanguage, and in certain cases the string will define a number,\n\\(\\Val(n) =\\) “the decimal number which is determined by the\nexpression encoded by \\(n\\) and interpreted according to the rules of\nthe natural language”. Now, in order to get the paradox, one has\nto prove that there exists a unique number \\(N\\) in (0, 1), satisfying\nthe condition given by Richard (see\n 2.5\n above), but this condition, and hence \\(N\\) itself, depends on\n\\(\\Val\\), which is possibly obscure and cannot be defined exactly\naccording to the rules of mathematics (p. 352, p. 358). The conclusion\nis that no such a real can exist and Richard’s definition is\ndefective in the same way that “the greatest prime number”\nis. \nSchönflies and Brouwer, by contrast, reacted to the paradoxes\nwhile strongly opposing axiomatic and formal methods. \nSchönflies (1906) stuck to a contentual, genetic conception of\nsets. According to him, sets are generated and, once formed, are\nconceptually invariant. When a new set is built up, it is added to\nthose that have been used in forming it, without altering their\npre-existent structure. So self-membership does not make sense, the\nuniversal set does not exist and Russell’s paradox disappears.\nHis view can be seen as hinting at a sort of iterative conception of\nsets. For Schönflies, the contradictions arise in logic, as\nopposed to mathematics, and are due to the scholastic nature of logic.\nHe regarded logic as having an unhealthy influence\n(“unheilvollen Einflüss”) on mathematics\n(“Für den Cantorismus, aber gegen den\nRussellismus” is the final motto of Schönflies\n1911). \nBrouwer’s approach to paradoxes was also based on a contentual\nconception of mathematics. It can be found in the dissertation of\n1907, chapter III (cf. also van Dalen 1999, pp. 105). As to\nRussell’s contradiction, Brouwer noticed that the usual logical\nprinciples only hold for words with mathematical content, not for\nlinguistic systems, like those of Peano or Russell. For instance, in\norder to decide whether a class falls under a propositional function,\nthe class has to be a completed totality. The contradictions show that\nthere are propositional functions which define complementary\n(disjoint) classes and yet do not satisfy the tertium non datur.\nSimilar ideas can be found in the philosophical paper of 1908,\n“On the unreliability of tertium non datur” (see van Dalen\n1999). \nA positive by-product of Richard’s paradox in Brouwer’s\nwork (1907, p. 149) is the notion of denumerably unfinished\nset, i.e., a set in which we can determine only denumerable\nsubsets of elements, but where these denumerable subsets do not\nexhaust the given set, so that one can immediately produce new\nelements of the set from any given denumerable such subset. Typical\nexamples of denumerably unfinished sets are the totality of countable\nordinals, the points of the continuum, and in particular, as could be\nshown using Richard’s paradox, the set of all definable points\nof the continuum (1907, p. 150). Brouwer considers\nBurali-Forti’s contradiction not as a mathematical paradox,\nsince it concerns a logical structure (the collection of all\nordinals), which is not a well-defined mathematical object and has no\nproper mathematical content. Mathematically speaking, the\ncontradiction can be avoided by denying that the largest well-ordered\ntype has a successor order type (p. 153; this is analogous to\nBernstein 1905b). \nAmong the French mathematicians, the semi-intuitionist Borel (1908)\nintroduced the distinction between effectively enumerable\nsets and denumerable ones. The Richard paradox is then solved\nby observing that Richard’s set \\(E\\) is certainly denumerable,\nbecause one can only determine at most a denumerable set of reals by\nfinite means. Yet \\(E\\) is not effectively enumerable, i.e., one\ncannot produce with finitely many words a procedure for assigning\nunambiguously a rank (i.e., a position) to each element of the set. In\norder to make the enumeration of \\(E\\) effective, one ought to have\nsolved all the mathematical problems which one could possibly state,\nbecause there are expressions which become definitions of a real only\nmodulo a proof or solution of a certain problem. Borel has in mind a\nparticular example: consider the expression “the unique\ntranscendental number whose decimal expansion is obtained from that of\n\\(\\pi\\) by replacing everywhere 7 with 8, and 8 with 7”. Of\ncourse, this is a good definition only if we have shown that the\nnumber is not algebraic (see Borel 1908. p. 446). \nBorel, like Poincaré, adheres to a point of\nview—definability in finitely many words—which is an\nextension of the algebraic, Kroneckerian point of view: only objects\nconstructible in finitely many steps are proper mathematical objects.\nHowever, unlike Poincaré, he disregards the problem of\npredicative definitions: for him all paradoxes of set theory derive\nfrom viewing the proposition that every denumerable set is effectively\nenumerable (“Tout ensemble dénombrable est\neffectivement énumérable”) as evident, which\nis false. \nOn the side of mathematical foundations, three chapters of Gerhard\nHessenberg’s Bericht (1906) on the fundamentals of set\ntheory are devoted to foundational questions. They contain interesting\nideas about the philosophy of mathematics, which unfortunately cannot\nbe discussed in detail here. For instance, Hessenberg underlines the\ndistinction between set theoretic definitions which give criteria for\neffectively deciding membership in a given set, and\ndefinitions which don’t. Concerning Kronecker’s\nconstructive criticism of the arithmetized continuum, he holds that,\nalthough each irrational number determines an infinite fraction and\neach infinite fraction possesses a formation rule\n(“Bildungsgesetz”), it is not true that such a rule is\ngiven by explicit finite means. For otherwise, we could\nderive (a form of) the paradox of finite denotation, i.e.,\nwere formation laws to coincide with definable ones, they would be at\nmost denumerable and hence the reals would be denumerable, against\nCantor’s theorem. \nIn dealing with set theoretic contradictions, Hessenberg distinguishes\nthe ‘ultrafinite’ (paragraphs 96–99) from the\n‘transfinite’: this latter notion is an exclusive\nattribute of sets. By contrast, the collections involved in the\nparadoxes (such as the Russell set, the set of all sets, of all\nthings, and of all ordinal numbers) are ultrafinite. \nAs to the proposed solutions of the paradoxes, Hessenberg was inspired\nby a Kantian idea. Just as in the natural sciences antinomies arise if\nNature is conceived as a closed whole, similarly the collection\n\\(\\mathbf{ON}\\) and the set of all sets cannot be conceived as\ncompleted totalities. Hence the distinction\n‘ultrafinite’/‘transfinite’ is apparently in\naccord with a theoretical approach which is close to Russell’s\nlimitation of size doctrine. \nClose to the same philosophical inspiration, the influential paper of\nGrelling and Nelson (1908) provides an attempt to unify paradoxes and\nto isolate their underlying structure. The philosopher Leonard Nelson\nwas a prominent figure in the Göttingen of the early twentieth\ncentury, who had Hilbert’s strong support (see Peckhaus 1990).\nThe paper is part of a project to develop a philosophically minded\n“kritische Mathematik”. It contains a new paradox\n(credited to Grelling) with a semantical flavor (see also the entry\n self-reference): \nZermelo’s axiomatization of set theory (1908; for more details\nsee entries on\n set theory,\n the early development of set theory,\n alternative axiomatic set theories)\n supplied a sensible tool for blocking contradictions. The main ideas\nof the axiomatization can be summarized as follows: (i) naïve\ncomprehension is restricted to a separation axiom, i.e., to a\nprinciple granting the existence of enough subsets of an already given\nset of objects (numbers, points, functions on a given space);\n‘enough subsets’ here refers to all the subsets\nspecifiable by means of definite conditions involving the\nprimitive notions (set equality and membership) and satisfying the\nlaws of classical logic; (ii) there are axioms ensuring that the basic\noperations of forming singleton, union, pairing, and power set are\nwell defined and that there exist at least an infinite set and the\nempty set; (iii) extensionality is assumed: two sets are equal if and\nonly if they have the same elements; (iv) an axiom of choice is\npostulated, which allows selecting a choice set out of any family of\ndisjoint non-empty sets. \nIt is immediate to see that Burali-Forti’s antinomy cannot be\nderived in Zermelo’s system, since the collection of all order\ntypes does not exist as a set, and Russell’s paradox simply\nbecomes the theorem that there does not exist a universal set. \nHowever, one could raise at least two objections against the theory on\ndifferent grounds. First of all, Zermelo’s approach is actually\nhighly impredicative and impredicativity was regarded as\nindispensable by him (else one would be forced to reject standard\nmathematics, e.g., Zermelo believed this was the case even with the\nCauchy-Weierstrass proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra). But\nimpredicativity makes the construction of a model or of an\ninterpretation more difficult and less evident. The second point is\nthat Zermelo believed that the paradox of finite denotation (mentioned\nby Hessenberg) and Richard’s are blocked in set theory, as the\nseparation axiom ought to yield clear criteria for defining sets. But\nthis is not the case, because Zermelo’s notion of definite\nproperty (definite Eigenschaft) is given informally and is\nultimately vague. \nThe latter issue was taken up in Weyl’s\n“Habilitation” lecture (1910), where he addressed the\ngeneral question: when is a relation explicitly definable from a set\nof given primitive concepts in mathematics? First of all, he\nconsiders, as a concrete case study, the problem of characterizing the\nexplicitly definable concepts of elementary plane geometry: these can\nbe inductively generated by means of five basic definition principles\nfrom two suitably chosen primitive concepts (e.g., the identity\nbetween points =, and the ternary relation \\(E(a, b, c)\\), ‘the\ndistance of point \\(a\\) from point \\(b\\) is the same as the distance\nof point \\(a\\) from point \\(c\\)’). \nThe five definition principles correspond to a finite\naxiomatization of the elementary comprehension principle, and\nthey imply the existence of exactly those sets (relations), which are\ndefinable by formulas in the elementary language comprising two\npredicate symbols for \\(=, E\\). More explicitly, one requires closure\nunder the logical operations of negation, conjunction, existential\nquantification and suitable combinatorial operations of permutation\nand expansion. \nIn the light of the geometric example, Weyl attacks the concept\n“defined by means of finitely many words” as not precise,\nand long before Fraenkel and Skolem, he succeeds in making the\nseparation principle precise: he simply replaces Zermelo’s\ninformal concept of definite property with the notion of\n‘relation explicitly definable from extensional equality and\nmembership by means of the basic elementary logical principles’\n(we should simply say: first-order definable). \nAccording to Weyl, Richard’s paradox teaches us the following\ndistinction: on the one hand, we are able to characterize only\ndenumerably many subsets of a given set by means of explicit\ndefinitions; but, on the other hand, new objects and (possibly\nuncountable) sets can be introduced by applying the remaining set\ntheoretic operations, like power set or union. \nWeyl addressed the problem of generating the admissible properties\nover a given domain a few years later in Das Kontinuum\n(1918). As in 1910, the set of sets of natural numbers that are\ndefinable via admissible operations (to which now also a form of\niteration is added) is denumerable. By Cantor’s\nargument there is no relation which parametrizes all subsets of\nnatural numbers (Weyl 1918, section 5). Weyl apparently followed a\nrelativistic attitude, according to which the extension of the\nuniverse of sets and their properties depend on the operations which\nare accepted to construct sets (see also the entry\n Hermann Weyl). \nIt should be stressed that Weyl’s attitude towards\nGrelling’s antinomy is utterly negative: he considers it pure\nScholasticism (Weyl 1918, section 1): there is no way, according to\nhim, of assigning a meaning to ‘heterological’ and one\nshould ultimately resolve these problems by appealing to\nphilosophy. \nIt is interesting to observe that, in the light of recent\ndevelopments, Weyl’s negative verdict ought to be weakened (see\nsection 6). \nIn the period until 1930, the problem of paradoxes led naturally to\nand was subsumed under the investigation of logical calculi (its final\nby-product being the Hilbert-Ackermann textbook of\n1928). This in turn opened the way to the\nsimplification of type theory, to important generalizations of the\nnotion of set, and to an almost final axiomatic elaboration of set\ntheory (along the Zermelian route, but also following the new path\nopened up by Johann von Neumann). The basic logical tool is\nessentially axiomatic formal analysis. \nDo circular objects exist in set theory? Zermelo’s view of sets\nas axiomatized in 1908 did not in itself exclude the possibility of\nself-membership. The problem was raised anew by Mirimanoff (1917a,\n1917b, 1920; see also the entry\n Zermelo’s axiomatization of set theory).\n Once circular sets are allowed, a strengthening of extensional\nequality by means of a suitable isomorphism relation\n(bisimulation, in current terminology) is needed which essentially\ncorresponds to the isomorphism of the trees picturing the given sets.\nRussell’s argument then suggests a distinction between sets\nof first kind, which are not isomorphic with any of their own\nelements, and sets of second kind which are indeed isomorphic\nwith at least one of their elements. In the light of this distinction,\nRussell’s contradiction shows that the collection R of sets\nof first kind does not exist as a set. Indeed, a set of second\nkind always contains a set of second kind; hence a set of sets of\nfirst kind must be of first kind. If \\(R\\) were a set, it should be of\nfirst kind; but then it could not contain all sets of first kind.\nMirimanoff 1917a then introduced the fundamental distinction between\nordinary (well-founded) and extraordinary\n(non-well-founded) sets: a set \\(X\\) is ordinary if every\n\\(\\in\\)-descending chain in \\(X\\) is finite; it is extraordinary,\notherwise (there exist infinite \\(\\in\\)-descending chains). It follows\nthat all sets of the second kind are extraordinary, but the converse\nis not true (for instance, consider the set \\(E=\\{e_1, E_1\\}\\), where\n\\(E_1 = \\{e_1,e_2, E_2 \\}\\), \\(E_2 =\\{e_1, e_2, e_3, E_3\\}\\),\netc.). \nFor the history of paradoxes, it is important to emphasize that\nMirimanoff 1917a gave a generalization of the Burali-Forti antinomy,\nthe paradox of grounded sets. This paradox actually proves\nthat the collection \\(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{F}\\) of ordinary sets (on a\ngiven set of atoms) is not itself a set. Indeed, let\n\\(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{F}\\) be the set of grounded (= ordinary =\nwellfounded) sets; then \\(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{F}\\) itself is grounded,\nfor were \\(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{F} \\ni x_0 \\ni x_1 \\ni x_2\\ldots\\), then\n\\(x_0\\) would be an ungrounded member of \\(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{F}\\),\nwhich is absurd. Hence \\(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{F} \\in\n\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{F}\\), so \\(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{F}\\) is ungrounded,\ncontradiction (the same paradox will also appear in Shen-Yuting\n1953). \nMirimanoff’s work is also important for the foundations of set\ntheory. He introduced the notion of ordinal rank for ordinary sets and\nhe noticed that ordinary sets can be arranged in a cumulative\nhierarchy, indexed by their ranks. However, the existence of a\ncumulative structure of ordinary sets is not considered as a ground\nfor excluding extraordinary sets. Mirimanoff (pp. 212–213)\nexplicitly points to the use of extraordinary sets for modelling\nmirror-like situations. He mentions the case of a book \\(B\\)\nwhose covering is decorated with a picture \\(J\\) representing two\nchildren glancing at the same book, i.e. to the picture \\(J1\\) of\n\\(B\\). In \\(J_1\\) one could perceive again the two children and the\npicture \\(J_{11}\\) of the book in perspective. Now \\(J\\) can be\nregarded as a set including as elements the two children \\(e_1\\) and\n\\(e_2\\), and the picture \\(J_1\\) of \\(J\\), which in turn decomposes\ninto the pictures \\(e_{11}, e_{22}\\) of \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\), and the\npicture \\(J_{11}\\) of \\(J_1\\), and so on ad infinitum, Now \\(J\\) is\nisomorphic to one of its elements, i.e. \\(J_1: J\\) can be considered\nas a set of second kind and hence extraordinary. This non-mathematical\nexample is suggestive of later developments, i.e., the theory of\nnon-well founded sets and its recent applications to semantics. A set\n\\(E\\) of second kind is also assimilated to an impredicative\ncollection in the sense of Poincaré (Mirimanoff 1920, p. 34)\nbecause of its circularity: indeed, \\(E\\) is given by a condition\n\\(E=(y, z,\\ldots ,a, b, c,\\ldots)\\), where \\(y, z,\\ldots\\) depend on\n\\(E\\). \nOn the other hand, in Mirimanoff’s 1917a there is a remarkable\nuse of Burali-Forti’s paradox which suggests a necessary\ncondition for set-hood in terms of size, viz., if a collection is in\nbijection with the set of all ordinals, then it does not exist as a\nset. In Mirimanoff 1917a,b, one can also find the idea of von Neumann\nordinal (von Neumann 1923, 1925) and a form of the replacement axiom\nis present. \nVon Neumann’s system of 1925 deals with an alternative axiomatic\nfoundation of set theory. There are two sorts of objects: objects of\ntype II (functions, corresponding to classes) and objects of type I\n(arguments), linked by the application operation of a function to its\narguments. The two domains partly overlap and there are objects of\ntype I–II, corresponding to sets (as functions which can also be\narguments). The fundamental axiom IV-2 then states that an object\n\\(a\\) is a proper class (i.e., it is not type I–II) if and only\nif the totality of its members can be mapped onto the totality of all\narguments. The Burali-Forti antinomy shows that the class\n\\(\\mathbf{ON}\\) of all ordinals is not a set, which implies with axiom\nIV-2 that there is an application of \\(\\mathbf{ON}\\) onto the universe\nof all sets, and hence that the universe of sets is\nwell-ordered. Conceptually, the system settles the problem of\nmaking Cantor’s distinction between inconsistent and consistent\nprecise and applicable (against Hilbert’s early criticism); it\nalso shows that global choice becomes a theorem on a suitable view of\nsets. Though circular objects cannot live in von Neumann’s\nhierarchical model of set theory, they can be found in the\ninvestigations of other mathematicians and logicians, e.g., Finsler.\nAccording to Finsler, paradoxes hinge upon circular notions, but\ncircularity does not necessarily lead to contradictions. In\nparticular, Finsler regards Cantor’s notion of set as\nintrinsically circular: sets depend on sets or on general things\ndepending also on sets and the associated dependence graph\ncan drive us back in a circle. For the contemporary reader, it is\nworth mentioning that an original intuition of Finsler 1926b is the\nuse of graph theory for representing circular structures. So\narrows are used for interpreting membership, and it is not difficult\nto imagine a set that has itself as unique element and more\ncomplicated circular situations (for more on Finsler’s set\ntheory see Holmes 1996 in Other Internet Resources). Finsler 1926\napplies Richard’s paradox in order to produce metamathematical\nresults, in particular ‘formally undecidable\npropositions’. However, Finsler’s arguments are not\nconclusive and cannot be considered a proper anticipation of the\nGödel incompleteness theorems (on the limit of his ideas, see the\ndiscussion in van Heijenoort, 438–440); but they show that an\nattentive reading of the paradox might have unexpected\napplications. \nConcerning the subsequent developments in connection with logic, the\nprocess of streamlining the tools of logic steadily continued in\nGöttingen through the work of Hilbert and his school. This is\nespecially clear from his unpublished lecture notes (e.g., those of\nWinter-Semester course 1917–1918 Prinzipien der\nMathematik), which are in many respects close to the textbook of\nHilbert-Ackermann of 1928 and which contain formulations of first and\nsecond order logic, together with ramified type theory and the axiom\nof reducibility. Paradoxes are derived by allowing a suitable form of\nunrestricted comprehension; the problematic assumption is located in\nthe admissibility of predicates and propositions as objects,\ni.e., formally in the expressions \\(X(Y), P(P)\\). Variants of the\ntraditional Liar and of the Berry antinomy are introduced.\nInterestingly, Hilbert sticks essentially to type theory (he does not\nlecture upon Zermelo’s system); he defines the ramified theory\nof types with the axiom of reducibility, proving that certain parts of\nmathematics can be carried out in the system (on Russell’s\ninfluence, see Mancosu 2003). \nThat type theory and Russell’s work had a central place not only\nin Hilbert’s Göttingen is further attested to by the work\nof Chwistek and Ramsey, who attempted a revision of Principia\nMathematica (PM) from opposite stand-points. Both authors\nrejected ramified type theory (RTT, in short) and the axiom of\nreducibility. Their work can be considered a typical outcome of the\nprocess that was to yield streamlined versions of logical formalisms.\nInsofar as paradoxes are concerned, the main problem is to show that\nRTT is not required for solving the paradoxes. \nThe solution proposed by Chwistek was prompted by a\nconstructivistic/predicativistic conception. His position in 1921 was\nthat Principia Mathematica were not enough to avoid\nRichard’s classical antinomy. On the other hand, Chwistek\nproposed a version of the Liar that can be reconstructed in the simple\ntheory of types without the axiom of reducibility, once we are allowed\nto quantify over all propositions. On his side, Chwistek adhered to a\nkind of nominalistic position, and tried to develop a theory of\nconstructive types for the foundations of analysis (his attempt of\nfounding mathematics without the axiom of reducibility was called\n“heroic” in the introduction to the second edition of the\nPrincipia Mathematica, 1925, see Linsky 2004). \nRamsey 1926 introduced the by-now standard distinction between\nlogical and epistemological contradictions (but see already\nPeano 1906, and section 3.3.1 of this entry). While logical\ncontradictions involve mathematical or logical terms, like class,\nnumber, and hence show that our logic or mathematics is problematic,\nsemantical contradictions involve, besides purely logical terms,\nnotions like “thought”, “language”,\n“symbolism”, which, according to Ramsey, are empirical\n(not formal) terms. Hence these contradictions are due to faulty ideas\nabout thought or language and they properly belong to\n“epistemology”. \nAccording to Ramsey, the antinomies of the first group (such as\nRussell’s, or Burali-Forti’s) can be avoided by referring\nto a universe of mathematical objects which is structured into types\nof individuals, functions of individuals, functions of functions of\nindividuals, etc. Quantification over arbitrary types is legitimate\nand hence types are closed under impredicative comprehension, which is\nconsidered necessary for mathematics. Types are intrinsic to logical\nand mathematical objects and the logical paradoxes are exactly those\nwhich require type distinctions to be solved (e.g., self-membership is\nblocked for objects in the type-theoretic hierarchy). In order to\nsolve the semantical antinomies (e.g., the Liar, Berry’s),\nRamsey proposes to distinguish several notions of meaning. In light of\nlater developments, it is interesting to note that for him\nsemantics is not a viable universal notion: in particular, it\nis impossible to obtain “an all-inclusive relation of meaning\nfor propositional functions. Whatever one we take there is still a way\nof constructing a symbol to mean in a way not included in our\nrelation. The meanings of meaning form an illegitimate totality”\n(Ramsey 1926, p. 372). This yields the clue to the solution of\nGrelling’s paradox (see 3.3.2). Let \\(R\\) be the meaning\nrelation linking an adjective \\(f\\) to the corresponding propositional\nfunction denoted by \\(F\\) (so that \\(f R F\\) holds). In the definition\nof “heterological” we do use the relation \\(R: x\\) is\nheterological iff there exists \\(F\\) such that \\(F\\) does not apply to\n\\(x\\) and \\(x R F\\). Now, there exists a propositional function, say\n\\(H\\), which is the meaning of the adjective\n“heterological”. Ramsey’s point is that this sense\nof meaning cannot be the same as that given by \\(R\\) and this blocks\nthe contradiction, when we apply \\(H\\) to “heterological”\n(ibid.,p. 370). So one needs a new meaning relation depending on the\ngiven fixed \\(R\\). These ideas foreshadow those of Tarski. (For an\nanalysis of semantical antinomies in a ramified context, compare also\nthe later contribution of Church 1976, also reconsidered and\ncriticized in Martino 2001.). \nWith the work of Gödel and Tarski, paradoxical arguments were\nreshaped into fixed point results, while the semantic conception of\ntruth, the formalization of semantics and the arithmetization of\nsyntax yielded firm grounds for systematic metamathematical\ninvestigations. In addition, an effort was made to elaborate new grand\nlogics as a reaction to the logic of Principia Mathematica.\nConceptually, the notions of (self-applicable)\nfunction-in-intension/operation and property/ predicate were accepted\nas primitive, and the very mechanism of definition/combination of\nconcepts was studied. This line of thought gave impulse to the\nelaboration of syntactical methods within combinatory logic and to the\nrise of recursion theory. The diagnosis of the paradoxes was further\nenriched by a subtler analysis of purely logical features of\nparadoxical reasoning: this is especially true for negation and the\ncrucial role of contraction and duplication properties built into the\nlaws of standard implication. Three valued logic was applied to\nnaïve comprehension. \nThe heuristic role of paradoxes is witnessed by Gödel himself,\nwhen he intuitively and explicitly relates his construction of\nformally undecidable sentences to epistemological paradoxes\n(“the analogy with the Richard antinomy leaps to the eye”,\nGödel 1931, van Heijenoort 1967, p. 599). However,\nself-referential constructions attained an adequate degree of\nmathematical rigor and became genuine mathematical tools only when non\ntrivial number-theoretic techniques were put to work (see the entry\n recursive functions),\n for instance in the analysis of syntactical substitution and in\nproviding arithmetical models of formal provability (the crucial role\nof substitution for producing contradictions was already noticed by\nRussell, although he did not publish this; see Pelham and Urquhart\n1994). Conceptually, it is clear from Gödelian constructions that\nself-reference by itself is innocuous if it is understood in the\nindirect sense: one can have formulas \\(\\phi(x)\\), expressing\nproperties of their own “name” \\(\\ulcorner \\phi\n\\urcorner\\), but no dangerous circularity arises. \nGödel’s construction was soon given a general form, as a\ngeneral diagonalization lemma, which refers to arbitrary definable\nproperties. This is to be found in Carnap 1934b, p. 91, Carnap 1934a,\np. 270, and in Rosser 1939, p. 57, Lemma 1: \nFor every formula \\(\\psi(v)\\) with only \\(v\\) free, there exists a\nsentence \\(\\phi\\) such that \nis provable (see also the entry on\n Gödel’s incompleteness theorems). \nAs a matter of fact the lemma has become the standard tool for\nproducing self-referential statements and for transforming the\nsemantical paradoxes into indefinability and (formal) undecidability\nresults (see the entry on\n self-reference).\n The algebra underlying the Gödelian constructions will be\ngrasped only much later during the 1970’s. It is also important\nto stress that a few years later (1938) an analog of the\ndiagonalization lemma (the so-called second recursion theorem) was\ndiscovered by Kleene and was soon to become a basic tool in the\nfoundations of recursion theory and computability theory. \nIt is evident from the work done in the twenties surveyed above that\nthe problem of finding a formal solution to the semantical paradoxes,\nsuch as the Liar and the Richard paradox, remained essentially open.\nType-theoretic solutions had not been pursued to the extent of\nproviding a systematic formal analysis of semantical notions (like\ntruth or definability). But why would this problem be worth studying\nfrom a logical and mathematical point of view? As a matter of fact,\nsemantical notions—in particular the notion of\ndefinability—were more or less explicitly used in certain parts\nof set theory (descriptive set theory) and in more “set\ntheoretically inclined” parts of function theory, which were\ncultivated by Polish mathematics in the twenties. At the same time,\nthe project of a formal methodology and of a scientific semantics was\ndeveloped by prominent Polish philosophers and logicians working in\nLvov (now Lviv) and Warsaw (Lesniewski, Łukasiewicz, Chwistek;\nsee Wolenski 1995 and the entries on\n Lesniewski,\n on\n Łukasiewicz\n and on the\n Lvov-Warsaw school).\n For instance, Chwistek attempted an elementary semantics on the\nground of a nominalistic foundational program, where sets are\nidentified with propositional functions, extensionality is rejected\nand the fundamental notion of semantics is the substitution relation\n“\\(H\\) is the result of the substitution of \\(G\\) for \\(F\\) in\n\\(E\\)” (Chwistek 1933, p. 374). In this stimulating environment,\nTarski developed his fundamental analysis of semantical paradoxes,\nfirst dating back to 1929 and 1930, reported by Łukasiewicz to\nthe Polish Society of Sciences in Warsaw in 1931 and then detailed in\nthe long memoir of 1935 (see the entries on\n Tarski\n and on\n Tarski’s truth definition). \nFirst of all, the analysis of the Liar paradox starts out by\nspecifying a formal requirement to be met in the semantical\ninvestigation of truth, i.e. “a materially adequate\n(sachlich zutreffende) definition” of the term\n“true sentence ” (wahre Aussage). This amounts to\nthe celebrated schema (T), which can be roughly stated in simplified\nform as: \nwhere \\(p\\) stands for a sentence and \\(x\\) is a name of \\(p\\) (the\nidea being in accord to the classical correspondence intuition). The\nresult that Tarski draws from the Liar is that there cannot be any\ninterpreted language which is free from contradictions, obeys the\nclassical laws of logic, and meets the requirements (I)–(III),\nwhere \nGiven these essential obstacles, Tarski provides a structural\ndefinition of the basic semantical notions, i.e., one that relies\nonly on the logical form of an expression and the fact that\nexpressions are recursively defined. But this route is only viable for\na language which is structurally described, e.g., a formalized\nlanguage. For such languages, which are usually closed under\nquantification and contain formulas with free variables, Tarski\nelaborates an appropriate notion of satisfaction, which\nallows him to introduce the notions of definability, denotation,\ntruth, logical consequence. It is then possible to give a precise\nversion and a proof of the adequacy condition (T) in a meta-science,\nwhose principles comprise: (i) general logical axioms, (ii) special\naxioms that depend upon the object theory we consider, and (iii)\naxioms for dealing with the fundamental properties of the structural\nnotions, i.e., principles of proof and definition by\ninduction. Given this semantical machinery, Tarski can solve in\nthe negative the problem of the existence of (a formal counterpart of)\na universal language, i.e., one where it is possible to\ndefine an adequate notion of truth for the same language. Although the\ntheory of simple types, (where the type 0 is the type of individuals;\nthe type \\(n+1\\) is the collection of all classes of type \\(n\\)\nobjects) with the axiom of infinity and extensionality is apparently a\ngood candidate as a general metatheory, it is shown that whichever\ndefinition we choose in the theory of types for the term\n“true”, then it is possible to deduce in the same theory\nthe negation of some instance of the adequacy schema (T). In the proof\nof this theorem, Tarski applies arithmetization and diagonalization,\nhence following the Gödelian pattern. On the positive side, the\nconcept of truth can be adequately defined for any formalized language\nL in a language (the so-called metalanguage), provided it is of higher\norder than L. Also, Tarski’s semantics makes precise\nGödel’s remark (1931, footnote 48) that “the true\nreason of the incompleteness is that the formation of ever higher\ntypes can be continued into the transfinite[…], while in any\nformal system at most denumerably many of them are available”.\nTarskian semantical notions play the role of the higher types hinted\nat by Gödel. To sum up, the outcome of Tarski’s work is\nthat the semantical notions are eliminated in favor of the\n(extensional) notions of type or set, and a theoretical explanation of\nsemantical paradoxes is finally achieved. \nIn the twenties and in the early thirties, the orthodox view of logic\namong mathematical logicians was more or less type- or set theoretic.\nHowever, there was an effort to develop new grand logics as\nsubstitutes for the logic of Principia Mathematica. These\nframeworks arose both as attempts to recover the simplicity of the\ntype-free approach, as derived from the so-called naive comprehension\nprinciple, as well as in order to satisfy metamathematical needs, such\nas the clarification of fundamental concepts underlying the notions of\n“formal system,” “formalism,”\n“rule,” etc. In particular, Church and Curry proposed\ntheories which (i) assume as primitive the notions of self-applicable\nfunction-in-intension (operation), and (ii) stress the very mechanism\nof definition/combination of concepts. If one looks closely at the\ndevelopment of these systems, one can see that paradoxical\nconstructions have become essential tools for defining objects and\nproving non-trivial logical mathematical facts. Following ideas\nof Schönfinkel and aiming at a mathematical analysis of the\nsubstitution process, Curry’s 1930 thesis introduced a formal\nlanguage based on basic general operators, the so-called\ncombinators \\(B\\) (composition), \\(C\\) (permutation), \\(W\\)\n(duplication), \\(K\\) (cancellation), \\(Q\\) (equality), and logical\nconstants like the universal quantifier and implication. Expressions\nare then inductively generated by application from constants;\nintuitively, a term \\(M\\) stands for a function, and the applicative\nterm \\(MN\\) (juxtaposition plays the role of application and\nparentheses are associated to the left) denotes the value of the term\nobtained by replacing the first variable of \\(M\\) with \\(N\\).\nSelf-application \\(MM\\) is admissible and this feature tells us that\nthe objects of combinatory logic cannot be simply interpreted as\nset-theoretic functions. The formal system consists of standard\nequations on combinators (e.g, \\(Bxyz=x(yz), Wxy=xyy\\), or\n\\(Cxyz=xzy)\\), rules for equality and the logical constants; its main\ngoal is to derive equalities \\(X=Y\\) and to make assertions of the\nform \\(\\vdash X (= X\\) is provable). Combinatory logic is a theory\nwhich analyzes the modes of combinations of formal objects,\nsubstitution, and the notions of proposition and propositional\nfunction (see the entry on\n combinatory logic\n for a proper introduction to variants of the formalism and an\noverview of the properties of related calculi). For Curry, the root of\nthe paradoxes is found in assuming that combinations of concepts\nare always propositions. The notion of proposition becomes a\ntheoretical concept, which is decided by the theory. Types\nare not assigned to the expressions of the formal system at the\noutset, but are instead inferred by means of the system itself, which\nhas a dual nature: it can derive identities, but also truths. In\nparticular, if \\(\\vdash MN\\) is derived, this can be read as\n“\\(N\\) is of type \\(M\\)” or “\\(N\\) is an element of\n\\(M\\)”. These ideas foreshadow fundamental developments such as\nthe so-called formulas-as types interpretation (see Howard\n1968). \nChurch’s formalism—originally introduced in Church 1932,\n1933 as a set of postulates for the foundation of formal\nlogic—includes conversion (i.e., computational) rules, which\nallow the replacement of terms with intensionally equivalent ones, and\nrules for asserting certain terms as “true”. The syntax\nyields a general notation system for functions, based on an\napplicative language, where there is one basic category of terms\n(well-formed formulas in his terminology). Some terms are formally\nprovable (or assertable) and are classified as true. Terms are\ninductively defined from a set of basic constants and variables by\nmeans of application and the characteristic lambda abstraction\noperator: if \\(M\\) is a term containing the variable \\(x, \\lambda\nx.M\\) is a term, naming the function defined by \\(M\\). The basic\nconstants designate logical operations: (a kind of restricted) formal\nimplication; existential quantifier, conjunction, negation,\ndescription operation, and generalized abstraction (i.e., if \\(F\\) is\nformal logical equivalence, \\(A(F, M)\\) is “what \\(M\\) has in\ncommon with any \\(N\\) formally equivalent to \\(M\\)”). It turns\nout that Church’s logic can interpret naive class theory and\nhence the system is suspiciously strong and expressive (strength and\nexpressivity are inherited by the formalism which was devised out of\nChurch’s: see the entry on\n the lambda calculus).\n Church’s hope was that contradictions could be avoided by\nensuring the possibility that a propositional function be\nundefined for some argument. \nHowever, the theories of Curry and Church were almost immediately\nshown inconsistent in 1934, by Kleene and Rosser, who (essentially)\nproved a version of the Richard paradox (both systems can provably\nenumerate their own provably total definable number theoretic\nfunctions). The result was triggered by Church himself in 1934, when\nhe used the Richard paradox to prove a kind of incompleteness theorem\n(with respect to statements asserting the totality of number theoretic\nfunctions). \nThe reason for the inconsistencies was eventually clarified by\nCurry’s 1941 essay. There he distinguishes two basic\ncompleteness notions: a system \\(S\\) is deductively complete,\nif, whenever it derives a proposition \\(B\\) from the hypothesis \\(A\\),\nthen it also derives the implication \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) (deduction\ntheorem or introduction rule for implication); \\(S\\) is\ncombinatorially complete (Curry 1941, p. 455.) if, whenever\n\\(M\\) is a term of the system possibly containing an indeterminate\n\\(x\\), there exists a term (Church’s \\(\\lambda x.M)\\) naming the\nfunction of \\(x\\) defined by \\(M\\). Curry then remarks that the\nparadox of Kleene-Rosser arises because Church’s and\nCurry’s systems satisfy both kinds of completeness, thus showing\nthat the two properties are incompatible. In the more\ntechnical part of the paper, Curry carefully axiomatizes the main\ningredients exploited by Kleene and Rosser and carries out a lot of\nnon-trivial work both on the logical side and the mathematical side\n(e.g, to develop a portion of recursive arithmetic, to define the\nexistence of an enumerator, i.e., a term \\(T\\) such that, if \\(a\\) is\nthe Gödel number of a closed term \\(M\\) and \\(Z_a\\) is the term\nformally representing \\(a\\), then \\(TZ_a =M\\) is provable in \\(S\\),\netc.). Curry’s proof of the inconsistencies of combinatory\nsystems is unsatisfactory because it heavily uses a detour through\nnumber theory and Gödelization, which, as a matter of fact, is\nunnecessary as Curry himself soon discovered and presented in a paper\nwith the same title as the one by Kleene and Rosser, “in\ndeference to the original discoverers of the contradiction”\n(Curry 1942). The main result in it is the following theorem\n(Curry’s paradox, see the entry\n Curry’s Paradox): \nFor the proof, it is enough to find, for any given term B, a term A\nsuch that \\(A=A\\supset B\\). Curry notes that a twofold construction is\npossible. By direct self-reference, we can choose: \\(A = HH\\), where\n\\(H=\\lambda Y (N(YY))\\) and \\(N = \\lambda X (X\\supset B)\\). On the\nother hand, one can apply indirect self-reference and exploit the\nmachinery of Curry 1941 and Kleene-Rosser: using an enumerator \\(T\\),\none sets \\(U = \\lambda X (TXX \\supset B)\\) and \\(A=UZ_u\\), being \\(u\\)\nthe Gödel number of \\(U\\). Curry suggests that these two routes\nare akin, respectively, to Russell’s paradox and to the Liar. It\nis interesting to note that the two ways correspond to by-now standard\ntools, the so-called first fixed point theorem and second\nfixed point theorem of combinatory logic and lambda calculus\n(Barendregt 1984, p. 131 and p. 143; see also the distinction between\nthe first recursion theorem and the second recursion theorem of\nclassical recursion theory, in this SEP, entry\n recursive functions). \nCurry’s analysis of the solutions to the paradox would lead us\ninto the realm of the theory of functionality, the history of\ncombinatory logic and proof theory. Here it is enough to recall that\naccording to him, a remedy would be to formulate within the system the\nvery notion of proposition, and a way to avoid the contradictions\nwould lead to a hierarchy of canonical propositions (or to a theory of\nlevels of implication, already adumbrated by Church). Related ideas\nhave been developed since the seventies by Scott 1975, Aczel 1980,\nFlagg and Myhill 1987, and others. \nIn the 1930s, an alternative route to solve the antinomies emerged.\nThis approach exploits the duplication (contraction) combinator \\(W\\)\nwhich satisfies \\(Wfx=fxx\\); if \\(N\\) represents negation and\n\\(Babc=a(bc)\\), then \\(W(BN)(W(BN))\\) is a fixed point of negation,\nand it is a functional analogue of the Russell class. On the logical\nlevel, assigning a type to \\(W\\) leads to the essential inference\napplied in the derivation of Curry’s paradox, i.e., the\ncontraction rule \\(A\\rightarrow(A\\rightarrow B)\n\\Rightarrow(A\\rightarrow B)\\). The role of contraction was noticed by\nFitch 1936, who observed that, in order to derive the Russell paradox\none considers a function of two variables, then one diagonalizes and\nregards such an object as a new unary propositional function. But this\nstep only works if \\(W\\) is accepted. Fitch then proposed a\n“non-contractive” logic, but his paper did not go beyond a\nbrief sketch of a fragment of classical logic with predicates. One has\nto wait until the mid eighties to see contraction-free logics used\nsystematically in proof theory and in theoretical computer science\n(see the entry\n linear logic). \nFitch 1942 proposed a new approach to the problem of finding\nconsistent combinatory logic systems, which were progressively\nexpanded and refined over many years (until 1980). Fitch’s\nmethod to avoid paradoxes consists of the construction of suitable\nsyntactical models, endowed with self-referential notions of class,\nmembership and truth. Truth and membership are inductively\ngenerated by iterating rules that correspond to natural logical\nclosure conditions and can be formalized by means of positive\n(i.e. negation- and implication-free) clauses. This fact implies that\nthe generation process is cumulative and becomes saturated at a\ncertain point, thus yielding consistent non-trivial interpretations\nfor truth and membership. Mathematically, a collection of positive\nclauses always gives rise to an operator, say \\(G\\), mapping sets of\nexpressions into sets of expressions and preserving the inclusion\nrelation (i.e., monotone); the saturated sets then correspond to fixed\npoints of the monotone operator \\(G\\) (i.e., to sets \\(X\\) satisfying\n\\(G(X)=X)\\), which exist according to a classical theorem about\ncomplete lattices (see Birkhoff 1967). \nIn the early 1940s, Fitch explored a purely positive (negationless)\ncombinatory system \\(K\\) with the explicit aim of defining a sort of\nuniversal formal system, where every system of logic\ncould be represented. Later he was able to strengthen his approach to\ninclude forms of negation and implication, insofar as he provided\na simultaneous generation of truth and falsehood, and this\nactually amounts to conceive truth as a partial predicate.\nFitch’s approach is radically intensional: classes are always\nclasses of expressions \\(M\\) in some language (say, of the basic\nlogic) and they are identified with attributes, while membership is\nessentially reduced to truth in the sense of \\(K\\). Thus, that \\(M\\in\nT\\) holds, essentially means that \\(M\\) truly falls under the property\nspecified (or expressed) by \\(T\\) (see also the entry on\n combinatory logic).\n Logical systems, along similar lines, were also proposed and proved\nconsistent via proof theoretic methods by Schütte in the early\nfifties (see Schütte 1960 for a comprehensive treatment). \nTo a certain extent, the ideas of Fitch can be regarded as introducing\nthe view that the basic predicates of truth and membership have to be\npartial or, if you like, three-valued. Bochvar\n(1937) outlines a proposal based on the introduction of a three-valued\nlogic, where, besides the standard truth values T (truth) and F\n(false), there exists a third value N, to be interpreted as\n“meaningless”. His logical analysis leads to the\nconclusion that the paradoxes involve meaningless statements. A\ncharacteristic feature of Bochvar’s formalism is that it\ndistinguishes two types of connectives, roughly corresponding to two\ndifferent modes of assertion. A statement \\(A\\) in itself assumes\nexactly one among the prescribed values (true, false or meaningless);\nbut the internal three-valued logical operations are also\nequipped with external logical operations, which correspond\nto statements on the metalevel and allow the use of classical logic in\ndealing with non-classical statements. Formally, he described three\nvalued truth tables for the main propositional internal connectives\n& (and), \\(\\sim\\) (negation), \\(\\vee\\) (or), \\(\\rightarrow\\)\n(implication), \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) (logical equivalence). The truth\nvalues of \\(\\sim A, A \\amp B\\), etc., coincide with their classical\nvalues if \\(A, B\\) assume classical values; they are meaningless\n(assume value N) if one among \\(A, B\\) has value N (strictness). No\nformula built up with the standard connectives can be valid (or a\ntautology, i.e., is true under all possible assignments), as \\(A\n\\rightarrow A\\) has value N, if \\(A\\) is meaningless. But there are\nconnectives allowing the formation of metatheorical\nstatements such as \\(\\vdash A, \\neg A, \\downarrow A\\), to be read\nas “\\(A\\) is true”, “\\(A\\) is false”, “A\nis meaningless” (in the given order). The value of \\(\\vdash A\n(\\neg A)\\) is true if \\(A\\) is true (false), false (true) otherwise.\nBochvar describes a version of the extended type-free logical calculus\nof Hilbert-Ackermann (1928), and, in order to dispose of the\nparadoxes, he restricts substitution and hence the comprehension\nschema of the form \n\\(\\exists F\\forall x(F(x) \\leftrightarrow \\phi)\\), where \\(\\phi\\) is\nany formula in which \\(F\\) is not free and which may or may not have\n\\(x\\) free. \nto conditions \\(\\phi\\) with only internal logical operations.\nApparently, Bochvar’s solution is not simply a gap\nsolution, where the logic is weakened; instead, he formalizes the\ndistinction between object level and metalevel in\nthe logic itself. This makes his theory quite expressive (e.g., it can\nhandle the very notion of “non-sensical”,\n“meaningless”). \nBehmann’s paper 1931 (presented in 1929) locates the source of\nthe paradoxes in the definitional machinery. The paper begins with an\nanalysis of Russell’s contradiction in the form of predicate\napplication. There he observes that, once the Russell predicate \\(F\\)\nis defined by the stipulation \nit must be possible to eliminate \\(F\\) from any argument involving it.\nBut, if we try to replace \\(F\\) by its definiens, we obtain \\(F(F)\n\\equiv \\neg F(F)\\), and we are trapped in an infinite regress, as\nthere is no \\(F\\)-free expression that could replace \\(F(F)\\). So the\ncontradiction is ascribed to an error in the theory of definitions,\nnamely to the use of definitions that give rise to an infinite chain\nof substitutions, without converging to a result. Behmann’s\ntechnical proposal consists in a reformed logic without types but with\nan added operator ! which, when given a predicate \\(\\chi\\), singles\nout exactly those arguments \\(x\\) to which \\(\\chi\\) meaningfully\napplies. For instance, the syllogism Barbara, usually stated in the\nform \nis corrected to \nwhere the range of the final quantifier is restricted to those \\(x\\)\nfor which it does make sense. Behmann did not develop a systematic\ntheory until much later and it is unclear how to interpret his special\noperator \\(!\\). Nevertheless, his work has inspired work by Aczel and\nFeferman (1980). \nLewis and Langford (1932) are led to conclusions which are not\ndissimilar to those of Behmann. According to them, the paradoxes show\nthat certain expressions do not express propositions. They\nadopt the notation \\(p : \\alpha\\) to mean that \\(p\\) is a name whose\nmeaning is the proposition \\(\\alpha\\) (so \\(p\\) and\n“\\(\\alpha\\)” denote the same entity and can replace each\nother); typically the Liar amounts to “\\(p: p\\) is false”,\nbut we can also imagine more complex self-referential situations, for\ninstance: \nIn this case, there is no contradiction, but we become entangled in a\nvicious regress (p. 440), and hence no proposition arises. In\ngeneral, one can create arbitrary complicated cycles and check that\nthey can lead either to contradictions or to infinite regress; but in\neither case, the expression fails to converge to a definite\nproposition. \nEven after the logics developed by Russell, Zermelo and Tarski had\ncreated the theoretical means to get rid of difficulties involved in\nthe notions of class, set, truth, definability, the paradoxes have\nremained alive. This probably is due to a persistent interest in\nalternative formal paradigms, to the controversial features and axioms\nof Principia Mathematica, and to the problematic place that\nself-reference occupies in mathematical logic. In this context, it is\nworth mentioning Quine’s paper of 1937 on the system NF (see the\nentry\n Quine’s New Foundations),\n which takes inspiration from the Russellian notion of typical\nambiguity, that is, from the systematic device of suppressing the\norder indices of propositional functions and their arguments, leaving\nthem to be restored at will, when needed, according to the discipline\nof type theory (see 3.2 above). The idea is to restrict naive\ncomprehension to those instances that are stratified, where\nin general a formula \\(\\phi\\) is stratified iff it is\npossible to assign a natural number (type in short) to each term\noccurrence in such a way that the resulting formula is well-formed in\nthe sense of type theory, e.g., if \\(t \\in\\) s is a subformula of\n\\(\\phi\\), the type of \\(s\\) is one greater than the type of \\(t\\),\netc.. Clearly, stratification blocks set formation when formulas of\nthe form \\(x\\in x, \\neg x\\in x\\) are present. Moreover, in NF the\nuniversal set exists. The consistency problem for NF is still open\n(though partial results are known concerning fragments with bounds on\nstratification or restriction to extensionality). Remarkably, NF\nrefutes the axiom of choice by a classical theorem of Specker. Again,\na classical result of Specker establishes the existence of a model of\nNF in a suitable version of simple type theory with a formal\ncounterpart of typical ambiguity. Paradoxes are not that far from NF.\nIn 1942 Rosser (and independently Lyndon) published a form of\nBurali-Forti’s antinomy in a seemingly natural extension (named\nML) of the system NF, obtained by adding “ultimate\nclasses”. ML was defined to avoid certain weaknesses of NF\n(e.g., with respect to number theoretic induction). Once more, the\nLyndon-Rosser result brought about the unexpected presence of a\nparadox in set theory and the foundations of mathematical logic. \nAs noticed many years ago by Kreisel and quite aptly recalled by Dean\n2020, p. 541, the right question to deal with is not how to get\nrid of paradoxes or to solve them: instead, the fruitful\nproblem is to get something out of them. Indeed, paradoxes\ncan be converted into plain undecidability/undefinability theorems,\nand this is the consequence of a systematic methodology: with the work\nof Gödel and Tarski, paradoxical arguments are reshaped into\nfixed point results, while the semantic conception of truth gives rise\nto a formalization of semantics itself, yielding firm grounds\nfor systematic metamathematical investigations, as can be seen from\nseveral early contributions by a number of logicians, e.g. Kreisel\n1950, Wang 1955. For instance, arithmetizing semantics yields a\nrefinement of the completeness theorem, the so-called arithmetized\ncompleteness theorem ART: every recursive consistent theory has a\nmodel in which the function symbols are replaced by primitive\nrecursive functions and the predicate symbols are replaced by\npredicates which are definable with just 2 quantifiers in a\nversion of formal number theory (cf. Hilbert and Bernays 1939, p. 293\nand Feferman 1960). By adding an arithmetic sentence Con(S) expressing\nthe consistency of a set theory S as a new axiom to\nelementary number theory, one can prove in the resulting system\narithmetic translations of all theorems of S. A by-product of\nthis metamathematical formalization is a de facto unification\nof set theoretic and semantic theoretic paradoxes, in the sense that\nparadoxes of either sort become tools for proving incompleteness and\nundecidability. Typically, a given paradoxical notion is formalized as\na predicate in a language of a theory interpreting (at least a\nfragment of) number theory Z; one then applies diagonalization,\nself-reference, etc., in order to get statements which correspond to\nnumber theoretic sentences that becomes undecidable or unprovable\ngiven a consistency assumption. \nPhilosophical motivations are strongly influential in contemporary\nlogical investigation of paradoxes and hence it is natural to wonder\nwhat is surviving of the initial Fregean theory of concepts, as based\nupon an inconsistent principle of abstraction and the logicistic\noutlook. Well, the answer is that a non-trivial legacy is still alive:\nthis is especially clear from the Neo-Fregean approach based on\nHume’s principle and variations thereof. Consistent subsystems\nof Frege’s Grundgesetze have been isolated and are currently\nstudied: see Burgess 2005, also for a comprehensive reference list to\npreceding work by Boolos, Wright and Hale, Heck, Wehmeier, Ferreira,\nAntonelli and May (see the essays contained in Reck and Cook 2016, and\nalso the entry\n logicism and neologicism). In\n addition, work in the Neo-Fregean tradition has shown that the\ninconsistency of the principle of extensional abstraction (Basic\nLaw V) in Grundgesetze is only an instance of a more general\nresult on the inconsistency in second order logic (extended with a\nsymbol for a function f from concepts to objects) of any abstraction\nprinciples that satisfy a condition called “part-whole”:\nif A is strictly included in B then f(A)≠f(B) (see Mancosu and\nSiskind 2019). \nOn the other hand, once we set apart the ideological inspiration of\nlogicism, we might believe that the development of logic and set\ntheory in the 20th century has fully sterilized paradoxes, and that\ncontradictions in logical systems are phenomena of the years of\nfoundational crisis only. But this is not true: paradoxes have been\ndiscovered in logical systems related to computer science. For\ninstance, half a century ago, Girard showed that a constructive theory\nof types, due to Per Martin-Löf 1971, and based on the\nCurry-Howard correspondence, is inconsistent with the existence of a\ntype of all types; the contradiction follows by means of a\ntype-theoretic reconstruction of an argument related to the\nBurali-Forti antinomy and the Mirimanoff paradox of grounded sets.\nLater, Coquand 1986 proved that certain extensions of the calculus C\nof constructions are inconsistent. Very roughly, C is a higher order\nimpredicative type theory, extending Girard’s system F, a\npowerful second-order typed lambda calculus with abstraction on types\nwhich is suitable for representing proofs of impredicative\nintuitionistic second-order logic. Coquand 1994 offered a new paradox\naffecting type theory, which refines Reynold’s result that there\nis no classical set-theoretic model of polymorphism (read:\nGirard’s system F, see the entries\n Type Theory,\n set theory: constructive and intuitionistic ZF). On the other side, a general type-free development of\nthe theory of constructions as a foundation for constructive\nprovability in logic and mathematics was originally proposed by\nKreisel and Goodman, but it turned out to be affected by an antinomy,\nwhich has been recently reconsidered by Dean and Kurokawa 2016. \nOn the borderline between foundational issues and applications in\ncomputer science, arguments with typical paradoxical flavor occur in\nthe investigation of Feferman’s explicit mathematics\n(EM), a theory of (self-applicable) operations and non-extensional\nclassifications. For instance, the existence of a strong power type\nconstruction leads to inconsistency in the so-called “theories\nof types and names”, a development of EM introduced by\nJäger 1997. Paradoxical arguments are also useful for assessing\nthe role of universes and refuting non-extensionality in EM,\nin presence of forms of uniform naïve comprehension (see\nCantini and Minari 1999). Indeed, the role of uniformity is essential\nin previous investigations. Concerning naïve comprehension, it is\nknown since the seventies (Malitz 1976) and the eighties (Weydert\n1988, Forti and Hinnion 1989) that there exist nice topological models\nof extensionality and non-uniform naïve\ncomprehension restricted to generalized positivity\nconditions. This has led to the study of so-called\nhyperuniverses. Additional consistency/inconsistency results\nabout the relationship between extensionality and uniform vs.\nnon-uniform comprehension principles can be found, e.g., in Hinnion\nand Libert 2003, Libert and Esser 2005. In a similar direction, recent\ntheoretical proposals combine anew ideas from combinatory logic and\nlambda calculus with “inductive” reinterpretations of\nnaïve comprehension and unrestricted truth schema, along a path\nalready opened by Fitch in the late forties (see Scott 1975, Flagg and\nMyhill 1987, Aczel 1980, and Feferman 1984). Beginning with 1992,\nthere was an attempt, due to K. Grue, to resurrect Church’s\nlambda calculus as a foundation of mathematics. Grue 2002 presents a\nvery strong extension of lambda calculus, the so-called map\ntheory, in which standard axiomatic set theory becomes\ninterpretable, and which can be used to shed light on the difference\nbetween Russell’s and Burali-Forti’s paradoxes. \nSince Mirimanoff, Finsler and others, logicians have studied universes\nof set theory where circular sets exist. However, it is only since the\nearly Eighties that a genuine mathematics of non-well-founded sets\n(see |\n\n set theory: non-wellfounded)\n is being developed. Using the axiom AFA of anti-foundation, direct\nself-reference is allowed in set theory, and there exist plenty of\nsets solving general self-referential equations (AFA was introduced by\nForti and Honsell in 1983; for systematic development and history, see\nAczel 1988). In particular, non-wellfounded sets are applied to the\nanalysis of the paradoxes, to the semantics of natural languages and\nto theoretical computer science (see Barwise and Etchemendy 1984,\nBarwise and Moss 1996). \nConcerning the issue whether self-reference can be avoided in deriving\nparadoxes, and hence whether there are genuine contradictions arising\nfrom ungroundedness, a positive answer has been given by the\nsemantical paradox of Yablo 1993: there are infinitely many agents ,\netc., each one claiming the same sentence: “at least one agent\nfollowing me is lying”; but this yields a contradiction –\nsee also the entries on\n self-reference\n and\n liar paradox.\n The issue this construction raises, namely whether circularity and\nself-reference are necessary and sufficient conditions to the\nappearance of paradoxes, has been further considered in Yablo 2006\n(see Cook 2014 for a comprehensive study on this matter, and Halbach\nand Zhang 2017 for a proof without diagonal lemma). Moreover, the\nconnection between the incompleteness phenomena and paradoxes has been\nextended up to include Yablo’s paradox, as a special case of\nLiar-type paradoxes (Kurahashi 2014, Kikuchi and Kurahashi 2016). \nThe analysis of self-reference and diagonalization has motivated the\napplication of algebraic and topological techniques: consider\nScott’s models for extensional lambda calculus (Scott 1972) and\ntheir subsequent categorical understanding. On the other hand,\ncategory theory has been used for new approaches to paradoxes since\nLawvere 1969. A mathematical approach to the general issue of\n“self-reference vs. unfoundedness” can be found in\nBernardi 2001, 2009. Besides Yablo’s paradox and a game\ntheoretic version of Mirimanoff’s paradox, several classical\nresults (existence of a non-r.e. set, Cantor’s theorems on the\nnondenumerability of the reals) can be transformed into existence\ntheorems for suitable unfounded chains (and formally, unfounded chains\nare regarded as generalized fixed points). \nIn standard metamathematics, an important role for a thorough\nunderstanding of the second incompleteness theorem is played by\nLöb’s theorem (Löb 1955). The proof of the\ntheorem is related to Curry’s paradox (see this entry,\nand\n Curry’s Paradox)\n and to an informal argument due to Geach 1955. Furthermore,\nLöb’s theorem is essential for defining mathematical\nstructures, which are adequate for providing versions of\nself-reference and incompleteness (see the so-called Magari\nalgebras and the modal analysis of formal provability, Boolos\n1993). In the same direction, there are applications of\nBerry’s paradox. For instance, in 1966 Vopenka proved\nthe second incompleteness theorem for the Bernays-Gödel theory of\nsets and classes using a form of the same paradox. Boolos 1989\nexploits a Berry-type argument to prove incompleteness in the form\n“there is no algorithm whose output contains all true\nstatements of arithmetic and no false ones” without\nappealing to diagonalization. The Berry paradox has been related to\nthe incompleteness phenomena also because of work (going back to the\nsixties and the seventies) in the so-called Kolmogorov complexity and\nalgorithmic information theory. In particular, Chaitin has\nshown in a number of papers how to exploit randomness to prove certain\nlimitations of formal systems (see Chaitin 1995). In connection with\nChaitin’s results, Kritchman and Raz 2011 gives a proof of the\nsecond incompleteness theorem, which is based on an argument\nresembling the surprise-test paradox (see\n epistemic paradoxes).\n In turn, this paradox can be explicitly related to Solovay’s\ncompleteness theorem of provability logic (see Montagna\n1994), and more recently Egré 2005, De Voos, Kooj and Verbrugge\n2018 applied provability logic to solving the Knower’s\nparadox. It is worth recalling that – again on the side of\nepistemic logic – self-reference is applicable in order to prove\nincompleteness in belief models. Brandenburger and Keisler\n(2006) identified a paradox of self-reference in beliefs in games,\nwhich yields a game-theoretic impossibility theorem akin to\nRussell’s Paradox. An informal version of the paradox is that\nthe following configuration of beliefs is impossible: Ann believes\nthat Bob assumes that Ann believes that Bob’s assumption is\nwrong. This is formalized to show that any belief model of a certain\nkind must have a ’hole’. An interpretation of the result\nis that “if the analyst’s tools are available to the\nplayers in a game, then there are statements that the players can\nthink about but cannot assume.” Also, the mere fact of\nparadoxes like this one, with a distinct logical\n“flavour”, but arising out of treatments involving\nepistemic notions, is notable, as it can be regarded as an indication\nfor a direction of work that, hinging upon the many examples already\navailable in the literature, is likely to expand and become systematic\nin the future thanks to the application of formal methods (see also\nthis entry, §6.5 on this). Although not directly connected with\nthe incompleteness phenomenon, there are indeed several accounts of\nantinomies affecting what appear to be sets of apparently legitimate,\nnatural postulates involving certain epistemic notions. Let Leitgeb\n2021 work as an ultimate example of sources of this sort, presenting a\nsolution to the lottery paradox (see Kyburg 1961 and\n epistemic paradoxes)\n that affects principles relating categorical belief to graded belief\n(see also Douven 2021 that contains the former source). \nIn the final quarter of the last century a host of logical papers\narise from the discussion of the foundations of semantics, with a\nnumber of proposals which generalize or modify Tarski’s\nsemantical conception of truth. Tarski notwithstanding, since 1975 the\nhierarchical approach has been somewhat superseded by new ideas that\nhave rendered the ideal of logical and semantical closure in many\nrespect accessible (especially by means of the fixed point methods\nused by Kripke 1975 and Martin-Woodruff; see Martin 1984). We also\nmention the approach stemming from Herzberger, Gupta and Belnap 1993\n(see the entry\n revision theory of truth),\n that has connections with non-elementary parts of definability\ntheory, set theory and higher recursion theory (Welch 2001, 2009,\n2011, 2019). This has led to the general axiomatic study of\nrevision-theoretic definitions and theories of circular\ndefinitions (see Bruni 2009, 2013b, 2015, 2019). In Standefer\n2015 a connection is established between Solovay type theorem and\ncircular definitions of revision theory and a particular modal logic\nRT (revision theory): a completeness theorem for this logic, analogous\nto Solovay’s completeness theorem for GL, is proven. The modal\nlogic in question is built upon an operator that is naturally\nconnected with revision-theoretic construction (hence, the name), as\nexplained in Gupta and Standefer 2017. The proof theory of this system\nis studied in Standefer 2018. \nRecent advances on revision theory, have contributed to prove the\nfertility of the approach (in a direction related to the last part of\n§6.4 of this entry): Gupta 2011 presents an application to the\nconcept of strategic rationality in a certain type of finite games\nthat is connected to a common way of understanding rational choice in\nstrategic contexts. Although developed independently, Gupta’s\nstance is reminiscent of previous work by H. Gaifman about rationality\nbeing affected by paradoxes resembling the truth theoretic paradoxes\nlike the liar paradox (see Gaifman 1999). An extension of this\napproach to the class of all finite games is presented in Bruni and\nSillari 2018. The notable aspect of Gupta’s application is that\nit makes use of only the finite part of revision theory (i.e., it does\nnot need the transfinite iteration of this construction), and it gets\nrid of the rule for dealing with stages corresponding to limit\nordinals. This limit rule, which is essential to address the concept\nof truth, turned out to be the most critical aspect of the\nrevision-theoretic approach to circular concepts from both the\ncomplexity, and the conceptual point of view (see Campbell-Moore 2019\nfor a recent, new approach to the topic). \nThe wealth and variety of semantical tools has triggered a sort of\nexperimenting with a number of mixed proposals. Refinements\nof revision theory and generalizations thereof can be found in Rivello\n2019a e 2019b where a new approach to a formal theory of truth is\ndeveloped, which implements features of Kripke’s fixed point\ntheory with the Herzberger-Gupta revision theory. An analogous\ncombination, studied from a more proof-theoretic angle, was considered\nin Standefer 2017. Similarly, combinations of the possible worlds\nsemantics for the necessity predicate with Kripke’s\nsupervaluational partial models for the truth predicate are also\nstudied by Nicolai 2018. \nField (2003, 2008) has proposed influential solutions of the\nsemantical paradoxes which combine Kripkean and revision theoretic\ntechniques. According to him, the present solutions to the paradoxes\nare not satisfactory because of the following points: (i) the lack of\na decent conditional (and biconditional); (ii) the failure of (some\ninstances of) the T-schema (A ↔ T(⌈A⌉); (iii) the\nfailure of intersubstitutivity between A and T(⌈A⌉); (iv)\nthe impossibility of providing an internal analysis of the\ndefectiveness of the paradoxical sentences. Field (2008) has\nconsequently developed a theory of truth with a non-classical\nconditional operator, which allows to express a notion of\ndeterminate truth and to state that the Liar is not\ndeterminately true. Analysis of Field’s construction requires\nsophisticated set-theoretic and recursion theoretic\ndevelopments (see Welch 2008, 2009, 2011). Moreover, the\npossibility of logically enriching Kripke’s theory of truth with\nnovel conditionals has opened up new routes: e.g. Rossi\n(2016) provides an interesting method of incorporating a conditional\nconforming to Łukasiewicz three-valued logic in a fixed-point\nconstruction for truth. In the same direction, a considerable\nattention has been directed in recent literature to the so called\nrevenge problem: typical solutions, say, of the Liar paradox,\nrely on notions that, if expressible in the object language, give rise\nto new versions of the paradox. So, the solution is only an illusion.\nThe revenge problem can be instantiated by the so-called Strengthened\nLiar: informally, once we have a model which makes the Liar\nsentence L itself neither true nor false, and we can express this\nvery fact, L is after all not true. But this is the claim made by L,\nand hence L is true. So the paradox seems to show up again (for more\ndetails, see the entry\n liar paradox and\n the collection of essays contained in Beall 2007). \n“Indexical” solutions of the Liar have been developed in\nseveral contributions, e.g., by Burge, Gaifman, Simmons. The idea is\nthat the Liar paradox does not involve sentences, but specific\noccurrences of sentences, i.e., sentence tokens (this idea is to\nbe found already in scholastic solutions). For the sake of historical\naccuracy, let us mention that in 1913 Lesniewski, later Tarski’s\ndissertation advisor, had already advanced an indexical\nnominalistically inspired solution of the Liar in his paper A\nCritique of the Logical Principle of the Excluded Middle (see\nBetti 2004). \nBesides the model-theoretic side, axiomatic investigations of\ntruth and related paradoxes have become increasingly important\nsince the seminal papers of Friedman and Sheard 1987, Feferman 1991.\nSince the year 2000, this research thread has been intensively studied\nwith various aims, from proof-theoretic analysis to\nphilosophical discussion of minimalism (for a survey of the\nvarieties of truth theoretic systems and appropriate references, see\nthe entry on\n axiomatic theories of truth and\n the recent monographs of Halbach 2011, Horsten 2011; see also the\npapers Feferman 2008, Fujimoto 2010, Leigh and Rathjen 2010). \nLast but not least, the axiomatic study of epistemic notions has\ngreatly benefited from application of techniques used for proving\nincompleteness and indefinability results since the early sixties:\nthey have yielded negative results (Kaplan and Montague 1960, Montague\n1963, Thomason 1980) and established an interesting link with the\nsurprise test paradox. The situation may have also been changed by the\nstudy of possible world semantics for modal notions, conceived as\npredicates in Halbach, Leitgeb and Welch 2003. However this\nis open to debate and experimentation: for instance it is argued in\nHalbach and Welch 2009 that the predicate approach to necessity is a\nviable route — insofar as the expressive power is considered\n— provided one resorts to languages that involve both a\ntruth predicate and the necessity operator. \nA number of solutions have been proposed, which rely on the use of\nparaconsistent logics (Priest) or substructural logics (see the entry\n logic: paraconsistent,\n as well as the entry\n substructural logics and\n Mares and Paoli 2014). \nThe investigation of semantical and set-theoretic paradoxes in\ninfinite-valued logic—which was pioneered by Mow Shaw-Kwei 1954\nand Skolem in 1957 — has received a new impulse by contributions\nby Hajek, Shepherdson and Paris 2000, and Hajek 2005, 2010. Typically,\nin these papers basic results from mathematical analysis are\napplied (e.g. Brouwer’s fixed point theorem). It is worth\nmentioning that Leitgeb 2008 has given a consistency proof for a\nprobabilistic theory of truth with unrestricted T-schema by\nmaking use of the Hahn-Banach Theorem. A follow-up of the latter\nsource that connects with researches related to the revision theory\n(see §6.5), is Campbell-Moore, Horsten and Leitgeb 2019. \nTheories of naive truth—as based on the unrestricted\nbiconditional and on a logic without contraction—are to be found\nin the literature, e.g see Cantini 2002, Zardini 2011, Bacon 2013,\nStandefer 2016. Ripley 2012, instead, presents an alternative approach\nbased on a non-transitive logical system (see also Cobreros et al.\n2012, as well as Cobreros et al. 2015, which attempts at extending the\napproach to the paradoxes of vagueness). \nGrišin 1981 proved that the system based upon the paradoxical\nprinciple par excellence—the uniform naïve\ncomprehension schema—and (some form of) non-contractive logic\nenjoys cut elimination, and hence is consistent. On the other hand,\nthe consistency of the system is ruined by extensionality and this\ncould be counted as an additional paradox! Of course\n‘uniform’ here means that a variable-binding abstraction\noperator {x | φ(x,a)} for naming the\nset defined by φ, depending on a list of given parameters\na, is available. Interestingly, it has been shown that\nclosely related systems have unexpected applications to the\ncharacterization of complexity classes (Girard 1998, Terui 2004); on\nthe other hand, the system is computationally complete (it\ncan interpret combinatory logic, Cantini 2003). \nBesides tools from algebra and analysis, logical investigations about\nparadoxes have recently applied graph theory (see Cook 2004, Rabern,\nRabern and Macauley 2013, Beringer and Schindler 2017, Hsiung 2017): a\nbasic idea is the attempt to grasp in geometric terms the patterns\nof paradox, their structural features. For instance, one\ncan assign a reference graph (rfg) to sentences of the\nlanguage of arithmetic with truth via Leitgeb’s notion of\ndependence (Leitgeb 2005). It is further conjectured that a solution\nto the characterization problem for dangerous rfgs amounts to the\nclaim that basically the Liar- and the Yablo graph are the only\nparadoxical rfgs. This route is independently developed in Rossi\n2019 by exploring the wide range of semantic behaviours displayed by\nparadoxical sentences, and providing a unified theory of truth and\nparadox. The result is a theory of truth that yields a threefold\nclassification of paradoxical sentences (liar-like sentences,\ntruth-teller-like sentences, and revenge sentences), and proposes a\nway of interpreting all three kinds, as well as paradox-free\nsentences, within a single model, where the basic tool is a notion of\n“semantic graph”. In Hsiung 2020, instead, Leitgeb’s\napproach is combined with the one of Beringer and Schindler 2017 to\nstudy a type of paradoxes of finitary characteristic, which is defined\nin terms of Leitgeb’s dependence relation itself.","contact.mail":"r.bruni1974@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
