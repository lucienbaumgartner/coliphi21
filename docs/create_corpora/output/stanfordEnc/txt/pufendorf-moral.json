His fate shows well how\nphilosophical interests shape historical background narratives. More\nor less consciously, individual thinkers and the traditions they spawn\nframe themselves in terms of an edited past which – as in other\nforms of genealogy – they either appropriate, reject, revise, or\nignore. Thus intellectual ancestry is always more controversial than\nbiological inheritance, and the mere presence or absence of thinkers\nin particular developmental accounts is not necessarily an accurate\nindication of their actual historical role or importance.\n\n\nPufendorf’s thought is situated in post-Westphalian Europe, as\nthe Holy Roman Empire underwent a reconfiguration of power\nrelationships among its quasi-autonomous constituent states (Austria,\nBavaria, Palatinate, Saxony, Brandenburg, and others), while\nmaintaining a guarded posture toward external, competing powers such\nas France, England, the United Provinces, Sweden, Denmark, Poland, and\nSpain. Its main goals were to avoid relapse into confessional warfare,\nand to ward off the respective French and Ottoman threats on its\nwestern and eastern borders. In this context Pufendorf developed a\ntheory about the moral relationships of agents (individuals and\ngroups), the authority and duties of states, and the lawful\ninteractions among these. His chief objective, too, was to avoid\ndestructive social conflict and the devolution on any level into the\nantagonistic and, he thought, self-defeating condition known as the\nstate of nature.\n\n\nPufendorf’s approach was secular, non-metaphysical, and\nanti-authoritarian; it eschewed religious appeals, scholastic dogma,\nessentialism, teleology, and the frequent mix of these that appealed\nto many German thinkers, Catholic and Protestant alike. Instead, it\nbuilt on Bodin, Lipsius, Grotius, Hobbes, and the Italian\nreason-of-state tradition. Because of it, Pufendorf is known as a\nvoluntarist in ethics, a sovereignty theorist in politics, and a\nrealist in international relations theory. His kind of natural law is\ncalled ‘modern’ or ‘Protestant’ (Tuck 1987,\nHaakonssen 2004), in contrast to the metaphysical, neoscholastic,\nrationalist, or even Platonic version of the genre represented not\nonly by the School of Salamanca (Suarez, Vitoria) but also Leibniz and\nthen Wolff. Known as a philosopher and a jurist, Pufendorf was also a\nrespected historian whose accounts of (mostly, the external relations\nof) various European states exemplified his basic philosophical\nconcepts. He wrote notably on church-state relations, on intellectual\nand religious toleration, and on the Baconian theme of innovation in\nphilosophy. Because of the clarity and comprehensiveness of his works,\ntheir intellectual acuity, and their polemical edge and consequent\nnotoriety, they were translated into many European languages and thus\nprovided – often in the form of pedagogical tools – many\nof the basic concepts and distinctions operative in the 18th-century\ndiscourse about morality, society, politics, history, and\ninternational affairs. Indeed, both directly and through his many\neditors, translators, and imitators, Pufendorf was largely responsible\nfor the so-called ubiquity of natural law as a shared discourse during\nthe following century (Haakonssen 2012).\n\nSamuel Pufendorf was born on January 8, 1632 in Dorfchemnitz, a small\ntown southwest of Chemnitz in Saxony. The region’s Protestant\nelector, Johann Georg, had just been compelled by the Imperial Edict\nof Restitution (1629), and by Tilly’s sack of Magdeburg (1631),\nto abandon his neutral stance in the Thirty Years War and join the\nnewly arrived (1630) Swedes under Gustavus Adolphus in an\nanti-Habsburg alliance. This, and his return to the Imperial fold in\n1635, exposed his territories to previously avoided predations that\nwould influence the young Pufendorf’s outlook on the Empire,\nreligion, and political power – if not also the human condition\nmore generally. Samuel’s father, Esaias Pufendorf, assumed the\nLutheran pastorate at nearby Flöha in 1633, and it was there a\nfew years later that the family experienced first-hand the terrors of\nthe war (Döring 1996a). There were ten children beside Samuel,\nseven of whom survived to adulthood. Of these he was the second\nyoungest of four brothers, some three years behind Esaias\n(1628–1687), who would become one of Europe’s most\naccomplished diplomats and remained, as well, Samuel’s lifelong\nconfidant and benefactor (Bérenger 1993, Fiedler 2003). The\ndedication in Pufendorf’s Select Academic Dissertations\n(DAS 1675b) acknowledges the debt. \nLike his brothers, Pufendorf was home-schooled until age thirteen\n(1645), when his poverty and Latinity qualified him for admission to\nthe subsidized Fürstenschule at Grimma, near Leipzig.\nThere he studied grammar, logic, rhetoric, the Bible, Lutheran\ntheology, and the Greek and Latin classics (Meyer 1894). His\nparticular relish for the latter laid the foundations of the broad\nphilological competence evident in and formative of his natural law\nwritings. Indeed, shortly before leaving for Leipzig in the fall of\n1650 he was chosen to compose a Latin poem celebrating the 100th\nanniversary of the school. \nLeipzig: The university at Leipzig was far more cultivated and diverse\nthan acknowledged by 19th-century authors like Treitschke (Treitschke\n1897; Döring 2004, 1994), though it remained a center of Lutheran\northodoxy, polemically anti-Calvinist and anti-Catholic, and generally\ndevoted to a metaphysical scholasticism and Aristotelianism closely\ntied to theology. Samuel’s studies there included this\ndiscipline, which his father had intended as a preparation for the\nministry. However, like his brother Esaias, and as indicated by his\nown extra-curricular activities in the Collegium Anthologicum\n– a student academic society before which he made some fifty\npresentations on philological, biblical, historical, and political\nthemes (in KVS 1995e, pp. 21–86]; see Döring 1988,1992)\n– he also expanded his studies into other areas including\nphilosophy, jurisprudence, and mathematics. He remained at Leipzig\nuntil early 1658, with an intervening year (1657) at Jena where he\nreceived his Magister (bachelor’s) degree. In Jena,\nPufendorf (like Leibniz after him) lived and studied with Erhard\nWeigel (1625–1699), the eclectic mathematician and polymath (who\nhad moved there from Leipzig several years earlier) by whom he was\nintroduced to Galileo, Grotius, Descartes, and Hobbes – authors\nwithout whom his future views would have been unimaginable. It was\nfrom Weigel, too, that Pufendorf seems to have derived the important\ndistinction between physical and moral entities, as well as the\nmethodological ideal of a mathematically rigorous, or demonstrative\nsystem of moral philosophy (Sprenger 1996) to which he initially\naspired (especially in distinguishing himself from Aristotelian virtue\ntheory). \nDenmark: Sweden’s involvement in the Thirty Years War and its\nstake in the Westphalian treaty that ended it increased the presence\nof its aristocrats at many German courts and universities, including\nLeipzig and Heidelberg. Esaias had already parlayed such contacts into\na Swedish diplomatic career and now urged his brother to do the same,\nin view of the limited professional prospects in Saxony. Thus, in\nApril 1658 Samuel assumed the post of tutor to the family of\nSweden’s special envoy to Copenhagen, Peter Julius Coyet. This\nchoice proved eventful, for when Charles X. Gustav unexpectedly\nrenewed the First Northern War (1655–1660) against Denmark, the\nSwedish delegation was imprisoned for eight months. It was then,\nwithout access to library or books, that Pufendorf wrote his first\nmajor work, Elements of Universal Jurisprudence (EJU 1660),\nwhich is explicitly based on Grotius and Hobbes. Upon being released\nin 1659, and after a serious illness and nearly dying by shipwreck in\nthe Baltic, Pufendorf went to Holland as Coyet’s secretary. In\nspring 1660 he was enrolled at Leiden University, and though we have\nfew details about this period it appears that he turned to philology\nagain. He became acquainted with the classical scholar Johann\nFriedrich Gronovius and prepared editions of several Neo-Latin works,\nincluding Johannes Meursius, Miscellanea Laconica (1660) and\nJohannes Lauremberg, Graecia antiqua (1661). More important,\nhowever, was his acquaintance with Peter de Groot, Hugo’s son\nand the Palatine Elector’s representative in Holland. For it was\nat his suggestion that Pufendorf strategically dedicated his captivity\nmanuscript to Karl Ludwig (1617–1680), who promptly responded\nwith the offer of a university position at Heidelberg (Döring\n2006). \nHeidelberg: The Palatinate was one of the most devastated and\ndepopulated regions during the Thirty Years War, and its university\nreopened only in 1652. Karl Ludwig sought initially to install\nPufendorf in the (upper) law faculty there, as there was a vacancy in\nRoman law (Justinian’s Institutes). However, when both\nPufendorf and the faculty senate demurred, the offer became a\nprofessorship in “philology and the law of nations” within\nthe (lower, or preparatory) philosophy faculty – a position that\naddressed both the university’s needs and Pufendorf’s more\nobvious qualifications. There is no clear basis for Pufendorf’s\nclaim to have held the very first chair in “the law of nature\nand of nations” in Germany, and no support for the academic\nlegend that he later sought a position in the law faculty and, when\npassed over, spitefully wrote The Present State of Germany\n(Monz. 1667) – a severe critique of legal theories about the\nEmpire – to prove his qualifications (Döring 2006). Much of\nPufendorf’s time in Heidelberg was taken up with lecturing (on\nGrotius and Tacitus), and with developing the ideas of the\nElements, particularly through a series of dissertations that\n– according to the practice of the time – were written\nmostly by himself but defended orally by his students. The latter\nincluded a number of Swedish nobles – such as his former charge,\nthe young (Wilhelm Julius) Coyet, and the son of the Swedish\nchancellor Gabriel Gabrielsson Oxenstierna, and the (illegitimate) son\nof the late Charles X. Gustav (Gustav Carlsson) – some of whom\nalso resided with Pufendorf. These and other services on behalf of\nSweden’s interests in Heidelberg, and the continuing support of\nEsaias, led to the offer, in late 1666, of a position at the newly\nestablished University of Lund (in Scania, the Danish province\nrecently acquired by Sweden). Pufendorf’s departure from\nHeidelberg was apparently a career move and he always spoke positively\nof his time there, explicitly valuing the “freedom to\nphilosophize” that he had enjoyed (Jägerskjöld\n1985). \nSweden: Pufendorf arrived in Lund in mid-1668 to assume his position as\nprofessor primarius of the law of nature and of nations (in\nthe Law faculty), and of ethics and politics (in the Philosophy\nfaculty). Immediately popular as a teacher, well-connected at court,\nas well as confident and outspoken, he was soon embroiled in personal\nand academic conflicts with some of his colleagues, particularly the\njurist Nikolaus Beckmann and the theologian Josua Schwartz, who\nrecruited the Lutheran bishop of Lund (Peter Winstrup) to their cause.\nTheir discontent with Pufendorf’s On the Law of Nature and\nof Nations (DJN 1672), whose publication they actively tried to\nhinder, was articulated in An Index of Certain Novelties …\nagainst the Foundations of Orthodoxy (Index quarundam\nnovitatum … contra orthodoxa fundamenta [1673]) – a\nlist of thirty-one supposed errors in that work. The religious\ncoloration of some accusations made it a dangerous matter for\nPufendorf, yet he managed through his court connections to suppress\nboth the Index and the relentless attacks in Lund (Beckmann\nwas eventually banished). Still, the Index led to the\nprohibition of Pufendorf’s work in Saxony and embroiled him in\nbitter conflicts with professors there for many years. His articulate\nresponses during this prolonged debate, including his\nself-justificatory autobiography, were later published under the title\nof Scandinavian Quarrel (ES 1686c). The collection not only\nreveals Pufendorf as a consummate polemicist but is also valuable for\nthe clarification of important points in his natural law treatises,\nand as an entry into the bitter debates (in Germany) between secular\nnatural lawyers and the Lutheran scholastics and theologians whom they\nchallenged (De Angelis 2004). \nIn 1673 Pufendorf published On the Duty of Man and Citizen\nAccording to Natural Law (DO 1673), a short compendium based on\nDJN that guaranteed him a place in university curricula for a century.\nMoreover, a collection of his dissertations from both the Heidelberg\nand Lund periods appeared in 1675 as Select Academic\nDissertations (DAS). That year also saw the appearance of a\nlengthy political tract (Discussion of Certain Writers of\nBrandenburg [Discussio, in KVS 1995e, pp. 235–336])\njustifying Sweden’s entry into the Dutch War (1672–1678)\non the side of France, particularly its unprovoked attack (1674) on\nBrandenburg. This war also occasioned a Danish invasion of Scania,\nincluding Lund, and even though the young Charles XI (1655–1697)\ndefeated the invaders, the university remained closed for years. So\nPufendorf moved to Stockholm (1677), assuming the duties of royal\nSwedish historiographer and, later, privy councillor and private\nsecretary (1682) to the dowager queen, Hedwig Eleonora. He continued\nto cultivate his relations with the Swedish ruling class, wrote\nadditional political opinions (including Dissertation on the\nAlliances between Sweden and France [Occas. 1680, in KVS, pp.\n337–385]; see Saunders 2009), and began the laborious archival\nwork that underlay his large histories of Sweden (Gust. Ad., C.\nGust.). These accounts focused mainly on external, international\naffairs. However, Pufendorf’s detailed knowledge of internal\nSwedish politics is evident in Les anecdotes de Suède\n(Pufendorf 1719), which was written during Sweden’s turn toward\nroyal absolutism in the 1680s (the Reduktion). That piece has\nsometimes been attributed to Esaias, though there is an autograph in\nSamuel’s hand (Döring 2012, p. 199, n. 58). \nPufendorf had also lectured on history at Lund and Heidelberg, and in\n1682 after the appearance of a pirated, Swedish version of this\nmaterial based on student notes, he issued (one of only two works in\nGerman) An Introduction to the History of the Principal Kingdoms\nand States of Europe (Einl.). The twelfth chapter of this work\ncontains a long, critical account of the papacy that had appeared\npseudonymously several years earlier (Basilii Hyperetae\nhistorische und politische Beschreibung der geistlichen Monarchie des\nStuhls zu Rom [1679]). Moreover, through the 1695 English version\nit acquired a thirteenth chapter, which is a actually a condensation\n– by the translator (Jodocus Crull, see Seidler 2013) – of\nthe independent volume on Sweden (Continued Introduction\n[Einl. 1686b]) whereby Pufendorf had supplemented the\nIntroduction in 1686. Both Introductions underwent\nmultiple editions in many languages well into the 18th century. During\nthe early 1680s Pufendorf also prepared a significantly revised\nedition (1684) of DJN which emphasized the similarities to Cumberland\nand Stoicism (Palladini 2002, Saastamoinen 1999/2000) to make its\nproblematic Hobbesian inheritance less obvious and, perhaps, his life\neasier (Palladini 1990, 2008). \nBerlin: During one of his trips to the Continent to gather archival\nmaterials and see to the publication of his Twenty-six Books of\nCommentary on Swedish Affairs from the Expedition of King Gustav\nAdolph into Germany up to the Abdication of [Queen]\nChristina (Gust. Ad. 1686a), Pufendorf entered into\nnegotiations with the Great Elector, Frederick William of Brandenburg,\nwho issued a formal invitation in 1686. This was doubly attractive at\nthe time. For not only had Brandenburg replaced Sweden as the main\ndefender of an increasingly beleaguered Protestantism, now squeezed\nbetween Austria and France, but Sweden’s internal affairs had\ntaken a sharp turn to the right, toward monarchical absolutism and\nreligious conservatism. In Berlin, by contrast, Frederick\nWilliam’s long-standing toleration politics met Louis\nXIV’s recent revocation of the Edict of Nantes with the Edict of\nPotsdam (1685), which invited the fleeing Huguenots to his\nterritories. Also in Stockholm, despite Pufendorf’s still close\nrelations to Charles XI and Hedwig Eleonora, some of his main\nsupporters at court had been dismissed, and his brother Esaias –\nwhose pro-French stance was now out of favor – would soon leave\nSwedish service (1687) and be sentenced to death in absentia\n(1689). Among the last works written by Pufendorf in Sweden was a\ndefense of Cartesianism (in the sense of independent philosophical\ninquiry) against the Swedish clergy, who had sought to ban it from the\nuniversities there (in KVS 1995e, pp. 432–47), and Of the\nNature and Qualification of Religion in Reference to Civil\nSociety (Habitu 1687), a treatise that condemned the French\ndragonades and argued for the separation of church and state as a\nmeans to religious toleration. \nGiven the Swedes’ past hostilities with Brandenburg,\nPufendorf’s thorough knowledge of their archives, and the fact\nthat he had yet to complete his history of Charles X. Gustav, the\nSwedes were loath to send him to Berlin. However, after considerable\ndelay he was given what was technically a leave of absence\n(Döring 1996b, Riches 2004, 2013). He arrived in Berlin in early\n1688, actually to prepare a history of Frederick William (who died\nlater that year) but formally as an aulic and privy councillor,\npositions with greater status at court than royal historian. During\nthe next six years Pufendorf completed his history of the Great\nElector (Fr. Wilh. 1695b) and began an account of his successor,\nFrederick III (1657–1713), which is notable for its long (and\nunregarded) narrative of the 1688 English Revolution (Pufendorf 1784,\nsee Seidler 1996). Moreover, he prepared a revised edition of The\nPresent State of Germany (published by Nikolaus Gundling in 1706)\nand he wrote The Divine Feudal Law (Feciale 1695a), a work on\ninter-confessional reconciliation (among Lutherans and Calvinists)\nand, barring that, religious and political toleration. In 1694\nPufendorf returned briefly to Sweden to arrange for the publication of\nhis On the Deeds of Charles Gustav, King of Sweden (C. Gust.\n1696), to collect a baronetcy (thus, his Freiherr status),\nand to conduct some diplomatic business between the two monarchs. A\nstroke or aneurism while in Stockholm led to other medical\ncomplications that resulted in his death, in Berlin, on Oct. 26, 1694.\nQuite appropriately, given his life-long interest in lay theology and\nhis involvement with informal religious gatherings called collegia\npietatis, as well as his emphasis on the biblical and moral\ndimensions of religion rather than its doctrinal aspects, the funeral\nsermon at the Nikolai-Kirche, where he lies buried, was delivered by\nhis close friend, Philipp Jakob Spener (1635–1705), one of the\nfounders of German Pietism. \nThe intellectual tradition with which Pufendorf is associated, and to\nwhich he was later seen as central, has been variously termed modern,\nsecular, or Protestant. Indeed, the first chapter of his Sample of\nControversies (Specimen controversiarum, 1678; in ES)\noriginated the historiography of the genre. (See section 5.2 below.)\nAs critics of that self-interpretation have pointed out and Pufendorf\nhimself admitted, elements of the approach were already present in\nprevious traditions, including Stoicism, Roman law, Christian and\nscholastic thought (particularly Vitoria, Vasquez, and Suarez), and\nthe Grotius commentary literature (Tierney 1997, Brett 1997,\nHaakonssen 1998, Seelmann 2000, Oakley 2005, Behme 1996, Hartung 2008,\nReibstein 1953–54). Still, Pufendorf and those who shared his\noutlook claimed a kind of Baconian novelty for their enterprise. This\nlay in its eschewal of metaphysics and theology as foundations for\nphilosophy, in its rejection of appeals to authority, and in its\nassertion of an ‘eclectic’ privilege not only to mix and\ncompare different perspectives, but also to place new bodies of\nknowledge on a so-called scientific footing (BW #137, 1996, p.194;\nHochstrasser 2000). The founder (in the sense of first practitioner)\nof this so-called “noble discipline of natural law” was\naccording to Pufendorf “the incomparable Hugo Grotius,”\nwho “set out to construct a work wherein he was not ruled by the\ninfluence of his precedessors” and that resisted the fragmenting\ntendencies of discrepant opinions (ES 2002b, p. 126).\nPufendorf’s assessment was seconded by his French translator,\nJean Barbeyrac (1674–1744), who noted too – in his famous\nPreface (1706), §28 – that with Bacon and Grotius\n“the Science of Morality was … rais’d again from\nthe Dead” (in DJN 2005 [1729], p. 78), and that it was Pufendorf\nwho had corrected, improved, and systematized it. (§31)  \nThe controversial beginning (and eventual locus classicus) of\nthe new approach, which would aspire to rigor and persuasion in morals\nand politics in the way that Descartes had sought them for science and\nmetaphysics, was Grotius’s “Preliminary Discourse”\nor “Prolegomena” (§§ 5–8) to On the\nRight of War and Peace (1625). For there, the Dutch classicist,\nambassador, and corporate counsel for the Dutch East India Company\nchallenged the moral relativism advocated by the ancient skeptic,\nCarneades, by laying out the basic requirements of communal living.\nUnlike Carneades, his professional concerns were not epistemological\nargument, moral proof, or philosophical system as such, but rather the\nconcrete mitigation of conflicts and the maintenance of peace.\nAppealing to a so-called principle of sociality or sociability\n(conceived as both presupposition and requirement), he sought to\nidentify the most general or minimal, and thus most widely acceptable,\nrights and laws of human association. These focused mainly, in his own\ncase, on international matters of war and peace, but in other natural\nlawyers like Pufendorf they addressed the entire range of human\naffairs. The modernity of the project, as well as its secularism, lay\nas noted in the intentional avoidance of biblical, theological, and\nconfessional presuppositions, and in the rejection of the essentialism\nand associated teleology of classical (abstract) realism – which\nwere thought to generate or exacerbate rather than to resolve\nintellectual and practical controversies (Forbes 1975, Tuck 1979 and\n1987, Todescan 2001, Ekardt and Richter 2006, Hunter 2007b). Instead,\nand in the manner of the physical sciences, the new discipline devised\nexplanations that emulated (somehow) mathematical reasoning and\nappealed to concrete observation, attempting thereby to create a\nshared outlook possessing theoretical coherence, empirical\nplausibility, and pragmatic effect (Röd 1970, Dufour 1980). \nThis reading of the modern natural law project is rooted in the texts,\nit was promoted by Barbeyrac, and it has been persuasively articulated\nmainly by Tuck (1979, 1987). However, aside from criticisms focused on\nits casting of Grotius and Hobbes (Mautner 2005, Sommerville 2001,\nZagorin 2000), it also seems wanting now as a comprehensive\ninterpretation of Pufendorf by being too inattentive to his more\nimmediate social and intellectual contexts. These included the\npolitical and confessional status of the Empire and, more\nspecifically, the metaphysical, theological, and Lutheran culture of\nnorthern Germany, Saxony in particular – as represented by\nconservative, Platonizing scholastics like Johann Benedict Carpzov,\nAdam Scherzer, Valentin Veltheim, and Valentin Alberti, with whom\nPufendorf and his younger colleague, Christian Thomasius\n(1655–1728), contended through much of their academic lives\n(Hunter 2007b, 2001; Palladini 1978; Sparn 1976). This conflict was\npractical and immediate as well as theoretical, affecting German\nacademic culture for another century up to and including Kant (Hunter\n2005). For the opponents propounded a theocratic politics guided by\nScriptural interpretation and supernatural metaphysics accessible only\nor especially to (philosophical) theologians, in contrast to the\nsecular conception of the state and its subsidiary institutions (such\nas the judiciary and the universities) proposed by Pufendorf and\nThomasius. In fact, the two readings may intersect and complement one\nanother. For Grotius, Hobbes, and also Descartes (especially his idea\nof philosophical liberation and innovation) certainly influenced\nPufendorf, albeit in a characteristically German, Protestant, and\nLutheran setting that he helped to transform with their assistance\n(Friedeburg 2008, Friedeburg and Seidler 2007, Dufour 2005, Schmoeckel\n2013b). \nClearly, early modern Protestantism was in this as well as other\nrespects a house divided, pitting those inclined to transcendent\nmetaphysics and theological authority against the innovators who\nrejected this approach. Of course, it is the latter stream – to\nwhich Grotius, Hobbes, Pufendorf, C. Thomasius, (and sometimes Wolff)\nare seen to belong – that is intended by the characterization of\nearly modern natural law as distinctively ‘Protestant’.\nBecause of its rejection of scholastic rationalism and universalism,\nand its interest in the particular, the singular, and the irregular\n(Seidler 2011) on various levels of analysis (i.e., its appreciation\nof difference and insistence on dissent, its ‘protestant’\nand broadly anti-‘imperial’ character), the discipline is\nalso aptly described as ‘individualistic’ (Haakonssen\n2004). And this feature links it, in turn, to the characteristic\n‘voluntarism’ of the genre (Schneewind 1998, Haakonssen\n1998), in distinction to the generally intellectualist bent of both\nancient and medieval natural law (Hunter 2003b, Haakonssen and Seidler\n2015). Voluntarism acknowledged not only God’s supreme and\nsingular omnipotence (exercised through the divine will), and thus the\n(to us) arbitrariness, contingency, and cognitive imperviousness of\nthe (created) world, but also humans’ individual and collective\npower over, and thus responsibility for, their own actions and the\ninstitutional contexts regulating them. In sum, the approach was\nsecular rather than atheistic, as it typically combined relatively\nsparse convictions derived from natural theology (understood as a\nminimalist philosophical view about a creative, providential deity and\nhis formal role in generating moral obligation) with an emphasis on\npersonal religiosity and confessional neutrality, especially in the\npolitical sphere. That is, it privatized (and to some extent\nmoralized) religion, it demarcated theology from philosophy (Tully\n1991), and it denied theoretical and political advantage to\ndogmatists, including those inclined to play the God card from the\nside of reason or philosophical metaphysics. \nLike other early modern reformist schemes, Pufendorf’s project\nfaced the central question of method in more specific terms. Initially\nhe followed the example of Weigel, his Cartesian mentor at Jena (whose\nown Arithmetic Description of Moral Wisdom would appear only\nin 1674; see Weigel 2003), by employing a quasi-mathematical approach\nthat aspired to demonstrative certitude in moral matters in place of\nAristotelian probabilism. Thus, the early EJU (1660) was formally\ndivided into Definitions (Bk.1) and Principles (Bk.2), with the latter\nsubdivided into Axioms and Observations. The truth and necessity of\nthe Axioms flowed directly “from reason itself” and a\n“bare intuition of the mind,” without the apprehension of\nparticulars, or interpersonal discussion, while the certainty of the\nObservations was known by the “collation and perception of\nindividual things corresponding to one another,” and by\n“common sense and experience” (EJU 1999, pp. 6, 117;\nDufour 1980, Röd 1970, Bach 2013). \nHowever, Pufendorf adapted this approach in subsequent works. Though\nhe purported still to favor a ‘mathematical’ over an\n(“lubrica, infinita, et vere invia”) empirical approach\nwhen writing to (Johan Christian von) Boineburg (1622–1672) in\nJanuary 1663 (BW #16, 1996, p. 24), criticism by Hermann Conring\n(1601–1681) and Johann Heinrich Boecler (1611–1672; see\nPalladini 1997a), which urged him to include a consideration of other\nwriters, particularly the ancients, soon led to a change in style.\nThus, beginning with his dissertations at Heidelberg, and then in the\nmajor natural law writings at Lund that emerged therefrom, Pufendorf\neliminated the formal scaffolding of the mos geometricus and\ninteracted more explicitly and directly with other, historical\nauthors. The new approach enlisted his considerable erudition (DAS\ncites over two hundred sources) – in a transitional culture\nwhere a reputation for being learned remained important – while\navoiding mere commentary or appeal to intellectual authority,\nprocedures which he explicitly dismissed. Instead, Pufendorf now\nemployed an ‘eclectic’ method that still involved rational\nanalysis and argument, to be sure, but that also acknowledged the\ncontingency of both his worldly subject matter and its intellectual\nconstrual (Hochstrasser 2000). The goal remained comprehensive\nunderstanding and demonstrative certitude, but one informed by wide\nand reflectively appropriated experience (derived from a careful study\nof history and contemporary events), and thus yielding a more\nempirically grounded and realistic (think Thucydides, Tacitus,\nMachiavelli, Lipsius, Hobbes) sort of moral and political\nargument. \nPufendorf’s ethical voluntarism is articulated through the\nnotion of “moral entities” (entia moralia,\nderived from Weigel), to which most of EJU Book I is devoted (Röd\n1969, Kobusch 1996, Lutterbeck 2009, Hunter 2019). Moral entities specify the basic\nterms, concepts, categories, distinctions, and classifications –\nin a sense, the metaethical grammar and vocabulary – out of\nwhich shared moral discourse is constituted. Conversely, they\ndesignate the ontological correlates or referents of this discourse,\nwhich are reliant on and yet distinct from the merely physical beings\nor settings in which they actually inhere. (See Statu #1, 1990, pp.\n83–84, 109–10), for the compositional metaphor.) Much of\nthe machinery of moral entities was carried forward from the EJU to\nDJN where, after being formally elaborated in the early chapters, it\nclearly structures the whole work. \nPufendorf begins DJN by noting the relative inattention to moral\nentities as such in comparison to the much-studied objects of the\nphysical sciences, even though “it greatly behooves man to know\nthe nature of such entities, which he has received the faculty to\nproduce, and whose power deeply suffuses itself throughout his\nlife” (I.1.1; Pufendorf 1994a, p. 99). He calls them\n“modes” – in accord with their dependence on\nself-subsistent entities (cf. Forde 2011, on Lockean “mixed\nmodes”) – and says that they are invented\n(inventis) by reflective beings who, by comparing things,\nform certain notions “superadded” to or\n“imposed” on the world in order to direct or temper free\nand voluntary human acts. (DJN I.1.2–3) Some moral entities are\nsaid to “flow naturally from things themselves, as it were,\nwhile others are superadded to physical things … by an\nintelligent power” (DJN I.1.3; Pufendorf 1994a, p. 100). This is\na relative distinction within Pufendorf’s general voluntarist\nframework, where God is thought to impose a basic normative dimension\non the world (conjointly and compatibly with its creation), but where\nhumans in fact devise the (further) distinctions that regulate their\nlives together – both in philosophizing about these and by\nenacting concrete practices and institutions to regulate them.\nAccordingly, one might describe the former as foundational or\nstructural categories, and the latter as subsidiary, instrumental, or\ndiscretionary tools of analysis. All moral entities, however, of\nwhatever type, depend for their existence on the will of intelligent\nbeings who externally assign normative, action-directing significance\nto things intrinsically lacking this, but nonetheless somehow\ncompatible with or receptive to it. \nThere are four types of moral entities, says Pufendorf, analogous to\ncategories applied to physical things: (1) states or conditions\n(status), (2) substances (specifically, persons), and modes\nin a more specific sense – namely, (3) moral qualities\n(affective/effective modes) and (4) moral quantities (estimative\nmodes). As in the physical realm, moral ‘states’ designate\na kind of (moral-legal) space in which persons (like bodies) operate\nand orient themselves; they are sub-posed by the latter even though\nthey also, in a sense, depend on them for their existence. Pufendorf\ndistinguishes two such states, natural and adventitious, the former\nreferring to the natural state occupied by all humans as such (thus,\nthe “state of humanity”), and the latter to the special\nconditions, institutions, or standing (e.g., commercial, marital,\ncivil) that differentially accompany it, in being created by and\nimposed on particular sorts of persons. Personhood or moral\nsubstantiality refers in turn to the various roles or agencies that\nhumans play or assume in such contexts, either simply as individuals,\nor as composites or collectives, and either on their own behalf or for\nothers (e.g., sovereigns, ambassadors). Since we typically enact\nmultiple, overlapping moral personae, it is possible for these to\nconflict, not only in the case of individuals but also collectives\nlike economic associations, religious groups, and political entities\nlike states, empires, or confederations. It is therefore important to\narticulate the respective obligations and rights of (different kinds\nof) persons, and to assess and rank them in terms of their relative\nmoral importance. \nSuch distinctions require the use of moral qualities and quantities,\nwhich are respectively affective and estimative modes. The latter\ninvolve the valuation of persons, things, or actions in terms of their\nsocial status or esteem, their price (economic value), or their desert\n(as in punishment and reward) – all of which are inexact,\ncomparative, and subject to alteration or adjustment (i.e., moral\nimposition is an ongoing process) (Seidler 2018). Moral qualities, in turn, affect\n(have an effect on) persons and are either formal (e.g., titles) or\noperative, with the latter subdivided into passive and active\nvarieties. Passive operative qualities enable someone “rightly\nto have, suffer, admit, or receive something” (DJN I.1.20),\nwhile active operative qualities are those by which we can morally\naffect or move others, as it were. (See Auer 2008, for an association\nwith Hohfeld.) They are divided into the more familiar notions of\npower/authority (potestas), obligation (obligatio),\nand right (ius) – which constitute the moral dynamics\nof social life. All such notions or entities, it is important to keep\nin mind, are imposed or assigned rather than given or found; the\nscheme is fundamentally ‘positivistic’. \nThe inherited term ‘right’ (ius) is ambiguous,\nsays Pufendorf, and it sometimes stands for law (lex). Though\nit may also be classed as a passive moral quality (as in allowing\nsomeone rightly [recte] to receive things), it is active\ninsofar as it permits us to command persons and possess things. It is\nsimilar, in the latter respect, to power or authority\n(potestas), which is subdivided into four types depending on\nwhether it is wielded over persons or things – either\none’s own or those of others. Authority over one’s own\nperson and actions is freedom (libertas), and over those of\nothers sovereignty (imperium); moral power over one’s\nown things is ownership or dominion (dominium), and over\nthose of others lordship (servitus). Each kind of power may\nbe acquired, lost, or held in certain ways: for example, the efficacy\nor strength of authority may be ‘perfect’ (complete,\nexceptionless, enforceable) or ‘imperfect’ (limited,\nflexible, merely hortatory or desirable), as may the force of rights;\nand the rest of DJN is essentially an account of how this occurs in\nthe different areas (spaces, or states) of life. The influence of\nPufendorf’s distinctions and their exhaustive application to\nparticular life sectors was enormous, creating the basic scaffolding\nof modern moral discourse. (See Hruschka [2015 et alia].) \nObligation refers to the “moral necessity” at work in such\nrelationships, by which one is “bound” to do, admit, or\nsuffer something (DJN I.1.21), and thus it applies to all spheres\nwhere authority, right, or other forms of moral normativity operate.\nPufendorf clarifies obligation at DJN I.6, in his discussion of law,\nsanction, and the claims of lawgivers. Law differs, he says there\n(referring to Hobbes, On the Citizen [De cive\n{1642}] 14.1), from counsel, agreement, and right alike, because by it\nan obligation is “introduced into a man’s mind by a\nsuperior, that is by someone who not only has the strength to threaten\nsome evil against those who resist him, but also legitimate reasons\nallowing him to demand that our freedom be restricted at his\ndiscretion.” (DJN I.6.9; Pufendorf 1994a, p.123) That is,\nobligation has a dual aspect involving both reason and strength,\nneither of which can separately give rise to it: the former generates\nreverence or respect in those who are (or take themselves to be)\nobligated, and the latter fear. Both are needed, since reverence\nwithout fear does not explain the compellingness of obligation, while\nfear without reverence does not explain its legitimacy (DJN III.4.6).\nThis analysis applies to obligation under both divine and human law,\nand in the former case, especially, it raises the question of whether\nvoluntarism or intellectualism, or an amalgam, offers a more adequate\naccount of moral duty. The matter has been much debated, starting with\nLeibniz’s critique (1706; in Leibniz 1972) and Barbeyrac’s\ndefense (1718; in Pufendorf 2003) of Pufendorf (see Schneewind 1996a;\nHunter 2004; Lipscomb 2005; Haakonssen 1998; Grunert 2000), and still\nin recent discussions (see section 5.3 below) of normativity referring\nback to those earlier treatments (Darwall 2012, Irwin 2011a–b,\nPink 2009). \nMore so than Grotius, Pufendorf clearly distinguished natural and\nmoral goods (DJN I.2.6), maintaining that the former are morally\nindifferent even if generally agreed upon by humans (DJN I.4.4,\nII.3.4). Thus, since moral norms are not directly linked to the\nintrinsic natures or purposes of things, or to the outcomes of\nactions, he was neither a teleologist nor a consequentialist in ethics\n(in the sense of maintaining an obligation to achieve or realize\nnatural ‘goods’ or ‘the good’, which are\nassumed already to be morally compelling). However, the so-called\nnatural goodness or evil of things, their ability to benefit or harm\nus, provide the rationale for the imposition of moral entities by\nintelligent beings from which obligation springs. That is, they have\n(especially in the case of natural goods) a sort of evidentiary\nfunction, explaining why the obliger wills such-and-such, and why the\nobligee wills (or might be motivated to) its acceptance. Thus, when\ndiscussing moral persons Pufendorf says that the impositions which\nproduce that rank or status should have a positive effect (solidus\neffectus) on humankind and not be made frivolously, as when\nCaligula declared his horse a senator, when the ancient Romans deified\ntheir emperors, and when papists, still, declare saints by a similar\nsort of post-mortem canonization – all with normative impact\n(DJN I.1.15). Similarly, when explaining the legitimating aspect of\ncommands or obligations (human or divine), or that in them which\nevokes our reverence or respect, Pufendorf stresses the commanding\nparty’s ability and willingness to benefit (or his having done\nso) those on whom the obligation lies (DJN I.6.12, DO I.5). In sum,\nwhile natural good and evil are not the source of obligation per se,\nand moral necessity is not hypothetical in that sense, they do explain\nwhy there is such a thing as obligation at all, or what the point of\nit is. Moreover, since what benefits or harms humans is known through\nexperience, empirical investigation, and knowledge of the past\n(history), these operate as heuristics for determining our obligations\nand explain why, in some cases, there may be disagreement about them.\nOf course, such differences do not concern whether moral commands as\nsuch formally obligate or not, but whether specific actions are in\nfact morally commanded. That at least some of them are (Pufendorf also\nallowed for indifferent actions), and that in particular moral spaces\nor contexts we can usually determine which ones, is a basic assumption\nof Pufendorf’s theory. \nThe concept of a natural state is so important to Pufendorf’s\ntheory that he considered political tracts which ignore it\n“gravely defective” (Statu #1, 1990, p. 110). The idea is\ndiscussed in no less than five of his works (EJU, DJN, DO, DAS, and\nES), which basically agree on its characterization and distinctions\n(Seidler 1990, Fetscher 1960). DJN alone contains two versions: one\n(II.2) to establish the general need for law and moral authority, and\nthe other (VII.1) to justify civil power or political sovereignty\n(imperium). These two treatments share a common conception of\nlegal obligation as justified imposition by a beneficent superior with\naccess to sanctions. This does not make them redundant, however, even\nif the political institutions created to eliminate the second,\npre-civil state of nature are enjoined by same natural law that also\ncommands (or induces) humans to leave their prior, pre-cultural (and\nbestial) states. Civil sovereignty and its mechanisms are needed\nprecisely because the cooperative institutions (e.g., language,\ncontract, property, marriage, family, household) that lift humans out\nof their previous, natural condition eventually create analogous\ncoordination problems on another level. Indeed, since similar\ndifficulties arise among civil states themselves, in an international\nstate of nature, there is need for yet another solution at that level.\nIn sum, Pufendorf’s conceptions of morality, politics, and\ninternational law are set against analogous natural states at each\nlevel; this facilitates the respective analyses, though the remaining\ndifferences also prevent their standardization. \nThe first DJN treatment of the natural state is preceded by a chapter\n(II.1) on the concrete importance of law. This discussion provides a\nbridge between the conceptual analysis of law and obligation, in Book\nI, and the following chapter (II.2) on the natural state, which leads\nin turn to the derivation of the natural law in DJN II.3. In it,\nPufendorf presents a moral anthropology suggesting what kinds of moral\nentities, or what obligations and laws, should be imposed in view of\n“the natural inclinations and pursuits of us mortals” (DJN\nII.1.6; Pufendorf 1994a, p. 138). These reveal – especially in\ncomparison to beasts – that humans’ greater freedom would\nactually be disadvantageous to them without further regulation; that\nis, randomized freedom, or license, is self-defeating. The argument is\nexpectably framed by Pufendorf’s general assumption that such\ncounterproductivity would violate the divine intention of having human\nactions display a certain “order, decorum, or beauty” (DJN\nII.1.5; Pufendorf 1994a, p. 138); however, it is solidly based as well\non a description of observable human tendencies and behaviors. The\nlatter show humans to be weak, diverse, and sometimes perverse: not\nonly are they anxious, ambitious, envious, superstitious, resentful,\nvain, vindictive, and the like; but they often disagree with one\nanother as well, even themselves; and yet (unlike other living things)\nthey are incapable of securing their basic needs without the aid of\ncreatures like themselves. For mutual assistance to be possible,\nhowever, and to avoid the difficulties continually generated by the\ntraits above, human action must be constrained by laws of freedom, as\nit were. Without these, humans would sink below the level of brutes,\nwhose welfare is non-voluntarily secured by physical laws, and they\nwould remain at liberty only to disrupt and destroy one another. This\nsort of inconsistency in human nature was – on religious,\nrational, prudential, and it seems aesthetic grounds –\nunacceptable to Pufendorf. \nThe natural state is a theoretical mechanism for further articulating\nthese considerations. A relative notion, it appears in three distinct\nbut overlapping versions, the third of which is specially elaborated\nby the DJN VII.1 account mentioned above. Each version involves a\npolarity or implied contrast: the natural state toward God (ad\nDeum), that in regard to oneself (in se), and that\ntoward other human beings (ad alios homines). The first of\nthese designates the human condition as such, conceived negatively as\na “state of humanity” in contrast to both the amoral state\nof beasts but also “toward [or against] God.” Humans\nemerge from it – using their de facto traits and\ncapacities (which Pufendorf associates with “soul”)\n– by moralizing themselves through social interaction, gradually\narticulating a normative sphere of rights and duties only formally\nimposed by their creator. The second natural state, with respect to\noneself (in se), designates the basic helplessness of\nsolitary humans and their almost inevitable lapse into an\nuncultivated, bestial life without mutual assistance. Classical\naccounts of this state depict individual humans as frustrated in their\nmost basic needs and desires, and as incapable of the refinement\nneeded to develop their distinctive faculties and exercise their\nfreedom. Human interaction can sometimes and to some extent eliminate\nthe natural state in this sense – a process facilitated by their\nprior, and concurrent, emergence from the mere state of humanity. As\nthe third natural state shows, however, humans may also threaten,\nendanger, or interfere with one another unless their freedom is\neffectively restrained by law. Here law means more than the\nself-interpreted moral law already operative in the first two states\nof nature (which, pace Hobbes, are not entirely lawless or amoral);\nrather it refers to civil law which must be imposed by a political\nsuperior with both the authority and the effective power to command.\nHence this natural state is best described as a pre-civil state, in\ncontrast to the pre-cultural and merely human states. Note: in none of\nthe three states does ‘natural’ function normatively in\nthe sense of a model or ideal to be realized, as in some other forms\nof natural law theory. Instead, norms emerge as one leaves such\nnatural conditions. \nAs already suggested, the three conditions overlap. Thus, imperfect\nhumans always remain (albeit tenuously) in the initial state of (mere)\nhumanity (DJN II.2.9–10), even when the other two natural states\nhave been partially sublated by culture and politics; for they are\nalways subject to, and somehow responsible for, the norms deriving\nfrom divine imposition or, alternatively, required by and for human\nbeings as such. That is, as neither beasts nor gods, they lack the\nautomatism of the former and the spontaneous goodness of the latter,\nand always carry a fallible burden of judgment, as it were. The latter\ntwo states may coincide as well, though usually incompletely, in that\nhumans may exit a pre-cultural state of need while still in a\npre-civil state of insecurity, or they may enjoy the security of a\ncivil state while relatively deprived of cultural goods. As well, even\nthough need satisfaction and cultural development typically occur\nbefore and apart from political order, in cities as opposed to states,\nthe latter sometimes seem a precondition of the former processes\n– as Pufendorf knew well from the circumstances of the Thirty\nYears War.  \nThe pre-cultural and pre-civil states of nature especially (i.e.,\nthose conditions respectively lacking in these respects) are further\ndistinguished into full or perfect, and partial or limited versions.\nThe former is purely mythical or hypothetical in that no humans can\nexist without their fellows. Complete non-cooperation or complete\nhostility are simply impossible, since no one would survive, and the\nonly reason to consider such scenarios is as heuristic devices\nhighlighting the conditions that humans actually inhabit (Behme\n2009a). Indeed, as Rousseau would iterate in his own way, extreme\nversions of the natural state are mere extrapolations from the more\nlimited, or mixed, conditions found in actual human history and\nexperience – as when rival families, clans, states, or\n(occasionally) formerly cultivated and civil-ized individuals (e.g.,\nCrusoe), are temporarily left to their own devices. Much of\nPufendorf’s discussion on the topic takes place through critical\ninteraction with Grotius, Hobbes, and Spinoza, whose comments on the\nnatural state he appropriates, alters, or rejects. The paradoxical\nupshot of his examination is that humans as such never were, are, or\nwill be in a pure, full, or perfect natural state, since it would be a\ncompletely barbarous, bellicose, and thus deadly condition. Thus far,\nHobbes was correct. However, as Pufendorf says in rhetorical\nopposition to him, Hobbes rather overstated the case; for the natural\nstate is actually a state of ‘peace’ (DJN II.2.7) –\nalbeit an imperfect, unstable, and insecure peace (DJN II.2.12).\nAccordingly, humans cannot ever – at least in this life –\nentirely leave the natural state (in all three senses) behind, as they\nare always imperfectly socialized, (only) partially cultivated, and\nincompletely or inadequately civil-ized (politic-ized). This explains\ntheir lifelong subjection to moral law and obligation (however\nunderstood), and their need – Pufendorf thought – for some\nsort of civil subjugation. That is, insofar as they manage to survive\nand thrive at all, they do so through incompletely realized forms of\nsocial cooperation that must (in a variety of ways) be constantly\nmaintained and improved. \nAccordingly, “the most common rule [regula]” of\nactions, called the right (ius) or law (lex) of\nnature, enjoins that humans “must, inasmuch as [they] can,\ncultivate and maintain toward others a peaceable sociality that is\nconsistent with the native character and end of humankind in\ngeneral” (DJN II.3. 1 and 15; Pufendorf 1994a, pp. 148, 152).\nThis law does not rest on an intrinsic morality of actions, an\nabsolute value of persons, on common agreement among humans, or even\non the long-term utility that generally follows compliance with its\ninjunctions (DJN II.3.4, 7–8,10) – though the latter two\nare not denied. Rather, it appeals to a divine superior who is taken\nto enjoin that which right reason itself can discover to be in\nhumans’ interest. (DJN II.3.19) That is, while the law’s\ncontent or practical purposiveness is articulated by right reason\nobserving “man’s nature, condition, and inclinations,\n… other things external to man, especially those capable of\nbenefiting or harming him in some way[,] … and the kinds of\nassistance and restraint he needs” (DJN II.3.14; Pufendorf\n1994a, p. 151), its normative force as law depends formally on the\nwill of a super-human authority with the power of sanction (DJN\nII.3.19–20). Pufendorf grants that the latter relationship\nremains “somewhat obscure” for those who follow the light\nof reason alone, since natural sanctions are imperfect and\nsupernatural sanctions out of play (DJN II.3.21, III.4.6). However,\nthe voluntarist problem of arbitrariness is avoided by positing\n(Pufendorf thinks proving, through natural theology [DO I.4]) divine\nbenevolence (providence) and consistency: human nature and the law\nregulating it are willed together by God for human benefit (DJN\nII.3.4–5). (More agnostically, one might refer to the benignity\nof things, as it were, the starting assumption that, at the least, the\nworld is not decidedly against us.) And that supposition in turn is\nsupported by the evidence of actual experience (both historical and\ncontemporary), which is in any case the only way to discern and\nunderstand the law’s requirements (DJN II.3.12). In short, God\nis not perverse, and the world not entirely inhospitable to morality\nand human welfare. \nPufendorf acknowledges the fundamental reality of self-love and the\npossibility of reading the natural law as a merely instrumental rule.\nHowever, he denies that self-love is the only human motive or\nnecessarily in conflict with other motives, and argues that in fact\nits aims can be fully or really achieved only through the natural law;\nthis does command humans to love themselves, albeit in a mitigated,\nrestrained, and thus more successful way (DJN II.3.14 and 18). That\nis, humans are not totally selfish or totally altruistic, but\npartially both. Hence the natural law does not forbid the pursuit of\nself-interest but merely regulates it, enjoining both the care of self\nand the care of others that humans already seek (in a limited and\ninadequate fashion). If human nature tended toward one or other\nextreme, the law’s injunctions would be either impossible or\nunnecessary (i.e., pointless); it is precisely humans’ medial\nnature, their motivationally mixed constitution, that accounts for the\nlaw’s normative force – in both its rational (legitimate\nreasons) and sanctional (strength) aspects. The argument certainly\nrequires its voluntarist (and theistic) premise, but it relies as much\non the compatible (and, supposedly, confirmatory) deliverances of\ngeneral human experience. In practice, given the stakes involved\naccording to either interpretation, it often may not matter which is\nemphasized. And this was undoubtedly why (beside its non-theological\nfoundation) Pufendorf’s more perceptive religious critics\nresisted it and often accused him of Hobbism, and why in turn his\nsecular adherents were not alienated by the deity lingering in the\nbackground. \nToward the end of his discussion of the natural law’s main\nprinciple, Pufendorf joins Hobbes in subsuming international (ius\ngentium) under natural law (DJN II.3.23) – which is\ncritical for understanding both – and makes some distinctions\nthat shape the rest of the work (Reibstein 1955, Seidler 2015). Like\nGrotius, he contrasts “matters which the natural law disposes by\ndirect precept or prohibition from those that reason has\npersuaded men to institute on account of sociality, or that may be\nundertaken by virtue of a license flowing directly from these\ninstitutions – in which case they are said to have a\nreductive relation to the natural law” (DJN II.3.22;\nPufendorf 1994a, p. 156; emphasis added). More formatively, he divides\nthe law’s injunctions – loosely reflecting the divisions\nof the natural state – into those toward God (adversus\nDeum), toward ourselves (adversus seipsum), and toward\nother humans (adversus alios homines). The first category is\ntreated separately in the pedagogically oriented DO (I.4), written\nwhile Pufendorf was fighting charges of atheism in Lund. However, DJN\n(II.4.3–4, III.4.4) folds it into the second group, particularly\nthe law’s (i.e., God’s) command that we cultivate our\nminds by developing appropriate beliefs about God through careful\nconsideration of the supposedly convincing arguments of natural\ntheology – a strategy that recalls the difficulties noted above.\nThe third category’s precepts regarding other humans are divided\ninto absolute and hypothetical injunctions, the former obligating all\nmen and women as such, whatever their status, and the latter –\nas in the direct/reductive distinction above – presupposing\ncertain states or institutions introduced by them (DJN II.3.24).\nHypothetical injunctions are also distinguished from positive civil\nlaws that may appeal to them for justification, even if based on\nparticular states’ advantage or specific legislators’\nvolitions. The three most important human institutions governed by\nhypothetical laws of nature are speech, dominion over things\n(property) and price (the valuation of things), and human sovereignty\n(including the civil state) – the subjects of DJN IV–V and\nVI–VIII. Book II concludes with three more chapters treating the\nvarious duties toward ourselves (II.4), the right and limits of\nself-defense (II.5), and the right of necessity (II.6). \nBefore turning to various categories of hypothetical duties in Book\nIII, Pufendorf examines several absolute requirements toward other\nhumans. The first is the prime natural law directive – also\nfound in Grotius and Hobbes – without which social life could\nnot exist: that no one should injure another and, if they have, that\nreparation should be made (DJN III.1). Second, since injury can be\ndone to others not only by damaging their bodies or things, but also\ntheir self-esteem, humans must show mutual respect and treat one\nanother as natural equals: for “one cannot lead a social life\nwith someone by whom one is not esteemed at least as a man,\n…” (DJN III.2.1; Pufendorf 1994a, p. 159). The basis of\nthis requirement is not human nature regarded metaphysically (or\ntranscendentally) as an absolute value, but a so-called equality of\nright or law (ius) consisting merely of our joint obligation\n(per natural law) to cultivate a social life (DJN III.2.2; (Fiorillo\n2013a, Saastamoinen 2010, Haakonssen 2011). Human moral equality so\nconceived also leads Pufendorf to reject the notion of natural\nslavery, even though he allows its compatibility with certain kinds of\ncontractual subjection in both pre-civil and civil society (DJN\nIII.2.8–9). Third, beside observing the minimalist requirements\nnot to injure or insult others, Pufendorf notes, one must also seek to\nbenefit them, “so that I am glad that others who share my nature\nalso live upon this earth” (DJN III.3.1; Pufendorf 1994a, p.\n165). This introduces the important distinction between perfect and\nimperfect duties, the latter consisting of so-called duties of\nhumanity which, though owed in the same sense as perfect duties,\ncannot be compelled. There are a number of interesting discussions\nhere, addressing the right of passage “for legitimate\nreasons” (justas causas, DJN III.3.5), the duty of\nhospitality, and the right of immigration – some of which recur\nin the fuller treatment of international law at the end of DJN VIII.\nDuties of humanity often depend on special circumstances. Thus,\nPufendorf could consistently approve of Frederick William’s\nliberal (and self-serving) pro-Huguenot immigration policy in\nBrandenburg while supporting Charles XI’s tighter restrictions\nin Sweden (KVS 1995e, pp. 472, 505; Habitu §54, 2002c, pp.\n118–21). Moreover, in the immediate context, he disagrees with\nVitoria (DJN III.3.9) by limiting the so-called right of commerce,\nincluding territorial access for such purposes, especially as it was\nused by Europeans in their conquest of America (Cavallar 2002, 2008;\nHunter 2007a). \nSince imperfect duties of humanity do not suffice for maintaining\nsocial relations, particularly those involving precise mutual\nexpectations, Pufendorf introduces (DJN III.4) another class of\nabsolute duties arising from pacts among individuals. The natural law\nstipulates no specifics here but merely commands that we enter into\nsome such consensual arrangements, since without them sociality would\nbe hampered and humans remain in the natural state. Pact-generated\nobligations are both adventitious, or based upon some antecedent human\ndeed responding to circumstance, and perfect in the sense of specific\nand compellable. They arise from either unilateral promises or\nbilateral agreements, and they create perfect rights (i.e., justified\nexpectations of exact performance) in others (DJN I.7.7). It appears\nhere that Pufendorf is an obligation theorist in that rights derive\nfrom obligations (DJN III.5.1; cf. VIII.3.5), yet there are also\nrights without corresponding obligations; that is, correlativity\nexists, but incompletely (Mautner 1991, 1989). He also rejects once\nmore Hobbes’s notion of a right to all things and maintains that\nrights claims to natural objects must rest, if they are to have\nnormative force, on the express or tacit consent of others (DJN\nIII.5.2–3); that is, they arise out of social interaction and\nare not presupposed by it. Given its importance for the development of\nhuman social life, five more chapters are devoted to the topic of\npromises and pacts: on their nature, subject-matter, types, and\nconditionality, as well as the sorts of individual and collective\nagents capable of generating consent-based obligations by promising or\nagreeing with one another. The discussion as a whole is fundamental to\nthe hypothetical laws of nature articulated in the rest of the work,\nin the context of various consensually created adventitious human\ninstitutions. \nSince humans’ emergence from the pre-cultural and pre-civil\nstates of nature is neither strictly concomitant or parallel, nor\nsequential, the development of DJN after Book III cannot be strictly\ncontinuous in either a topical or historical sense. Rather, it falls\ninto two partially overlapping sectors. Books IV–V deal with\nhuman efforts to leave the natural state of need\n(indigentia), while Books VI–VIII address the problem\nof security created by weakness (imbecillitas). Both require\nthe creation of new, complex, and formally organized kinds of human\ncooperation that address both the growing diversity and inconsistency\nof human desires, and the increase in human numbers. \nFundamental to both developments, however, is the institution of human\nspeech and the rules that make it effective, or possible (DJN IV.1;\nHochstrasser 2000). For without speech in the sense of symbolic\ncommunication human sociality would remain at a primitive and\nunsustainable level, in that the terms of human cooperation could not\nbe articulated and agreed upon. Conversely – and hinting at the\ngeneral providentialism that Pufendorf substitutes for traditional\nmetaphysical teleology – speech, or the communication of thought\nto others via sound, would be “of hardly any use” without\na social life (DJN IV.1.1). Unlike natural signs or associations\n(e.g., dawn, smoke, groans), speech is an artificial construct of\nhumans over time: learned rather than congenital, and arbitrary or\naccidental instead of naturally uniform, it is a clear instance of the\nwillful imposition of moral entities upon the world so as to give rise\nto new obligations. (DJN IV.1.4–5) Its utility depends upon\nconsent (tacit or express) and on the concomitant requirements of\nconsistency and veracity, which are both instrumentally and –\ninsofar as humans are obligated to be social – morally\nnecessary. However, though humans are bound by the general conventions\nof language and by the requirement of not lying to one another, they\nretain a certain flexibility of action based on others’ varying\nright to know one’s thoughts, and the actual consequences of\nsuch revelations. Thus Pufendorf distinguishes between lies\n(mendacia) and untruths (falsiloquia) and also\nallows for noninjurious deceptions (DJN IV.1.9). This proviso applies\nnot only to everyday life and its “harmless arts of simulation\nand dissimulation,” but also to the realm of politics and\ninternational relations, where total candor or naivete may be\ncounterproductive and defeat the injunctions of sociality (DJN\nIV.1.17; Martin 2009). Pufendorf returns to it repeatedly in\ndiscussing the duties of (esp. contemporary) historians (Seidler 1997,\nPiirimäe 2008).  \nIt is clear in this as well as other discussions how Pufendorf’s\nanthropological and social realism allows or actually requires a\ncertain flexibility in articulating context-specific obligations of\nthe natural law, even or especially within the particular human\ninstitutions created to enact sociality. It is because of this\nflexibility and consequent slipperiness of language that he goes on to\ntreat of oaths (DJN IV.2) which, presuming “human diffidence,\ninfidelity, ignorance, and impotence” (DJN IV.2.2), are a\nspecial means for assuring others (through associated divine or civil\nsanctions) of the reliability of our speech acts and the promises and\npacts that rest thereon. Of course, since oaths themselves involve\npresumptions and tacit conditions arising from the nature of\nparticular cases (DJN IV.2.14), they too may require further\nregulation. Thus, like other human institutions based on pacts, the\nrules of speech both antedate civil sovereignty but come eventually to\ndepend on it in certain ways as well. \nA fundamental use of speech is to regulate humans’ use of\nexternal things by appeal to the right of appropriation or dominion.\nThe latter rests on things’ necessity or utility for humans, and\ntheir presumed (and divinely intended) availability for man’s\nuse because of these features (DJN IV.3.1–3). Property\ndesignates a moral quality imposed on things, and it has a moral\neffect on other humans rather than (or beside) a physical impact on\nthe things or animals owned (DJN IV.4.1). That is, it is a social\nrelationship among humans (thus, solitary Adam’s relation to\nthings was not ownership per se, and could not be transmitted) based\non express or tacit agreements that may vary according to\ncircumstances, so long as the ends of human sociality are served (DJN\nIV.4.4). Before or without such agreements, worldly objects are in a\nstate of negative community, meaning that they belong to no one in\nparticular but lie open for anyone to use as needed (DJN\nIV.4.2–3, 4.13).  \nWhile Pufendorf acknowledges a kind of primitive community within\nfamily units, under the aegis of the father, he distinguishes this\nfrom positive communion in the sense of common ownership (Buckle\n1991). Both this and private dominion, or property properly speaking,\narise gradually with the proliferation and dispersion of family units,\nas humans and their needs multiply (DJN IV.4.12). For under such\nconditions it becomes necessary to distinguish mine from thine through\ncertain exclusionary conventions, if quarrels are to be avoided.\nTypically (but optionally), humans agree to a right of first occupancy\nor direct use, limited by the proviso of actual utility and the\nability to defend what is occupied (DJN IV.6.3) – though this\ndoes not suffice for ownership without consent. Some things like the\nopen ocean may (or can) not be owned, and so peaceful navigation\nthereon “belongs to everyone and is free.” However, other\nkinds of exclusive restrictions, such as unequal trade relationships\namong nations, are permitted, and “that vaunted freedom of trade\ndoes not prevent a state from favoring its own citizens over\noutsiders” (DJN IV.5.9–10). Also, since property is a\nmoral relationship rather than a physical quality, the same things may\nbe subject to different types of overlapping ownership (DJN IV.4.2).\nDominion need not be exclusive, and humans may grant others a perfect\nor imperfect right over their possessions. Indeed, they may be\nobligated to do so (DJN IV.8). \nSince owned objects serve different uses and are not equally valued by\neveryone, their exchange requires a common measure of comparison to\ndetermine their so-called moral quantity, or price (DJN\nV.1.1–2). Price is either ordinary or eminent, the latter\ndetermined by money as an independent, or objective, unit of value.\nMoney is explicitly created to serve the ends of exchange among both\nindividuals and states, and without it commercial pacts, or contracts,\nregarding both goods and services are inconceivable (DJN V.2.4). While\ncivil rulers have the authority to regulate property relationships in\ntheir realms (particularly specific forms of acquisition like hunting\nand fishing), and trade with outsiders, they are less free to\ndetermine the relative price of things since such arbitrariness would\ndisrupt economic exchange, especially interstate commerce (DJN IV.6.5;\nV.1.14). In general, sovereign determinations are less apt or useful\nin pre- or non-civil institutions that relieve human need, than in\nregard to those that insure human security – if these can be\ndistinguished. Nonetheless, economic tools like contracts may need a\ncivil sanction to insure their reliability and thus efficacy, and\nrulers may regulate property insofar as it affects the state’s\nbasic security interests and welfare – not only by taxation and\neminent domain but also through controls on foreign trade and on the\ngrowth of luxury (e.g., sumptuary laws), whereby the state’s\neconomic strength and independence are affected (DJN VII.4.7, VIII.5;\nSaeter 1996, Gaertner 2005, Young 2008, Skinner 1995, Seidler 2018). \nLike physical bodies, the moral body of the state is substantively\ncomposed of lesser members, particularly the simple and thus primary\nassociations (collegia) of marriage, family, and household\n(DJN VI.1.1). In their reproductive, rearing, and economic functions,\nthese basic societies mainly address the problem of human want or\nneed, though they also offer a minimal level of security. Their\nexistence shows that social cooperation is not suddenly imposed on\nisolated human beings with the creation of states, but that the latter\nis an additional form of association introduced to protect and\nmaintain already existing social units. Despite the natural\ninclinations that induce individuals to form or enter them, these\nproto-civil arrangements are, like states, based on agreements, and\nthey exhibit authority relations more or less analogous to civil\nsovereignty (DJN VI.2.11). The latter becomes necessary only when\npre-civil societies increase in size, number, and complexity to the\npoint where their interactions become dysfunctional and security\nproblems unmanageable. As in the case of other moral entities that are\nsuperimposed on one another, states do not replace pre-civil societies\nbut only protect, order, and – under certain conditions –\nutilize them. At the same time, especially in the case of other types\nof sub-state associations such as churches, they may also liberate\nindividuals from them (by divorcing civil from religious authority,\nand allowing religious diversity in the state). (See Seidler\n2002.) \nSince it regulates reproduction, without which human society would\ncease to exist, the institution of marriage is “the foundation\nof social life” (DJN VI.1.7; Dufour 1972, Ehrle 1952). Humans\nare obligated to enter it, though only in a general way that\npresupposes capacity, opportunity, and other facilitating conditions.\nDespite being commanded by God – like other natural law\nobligations – its immediate origins lie in each instance in a\nconsensual pact between basically equal partners (DJN VI.1.12). This\nholds even where a woman’s (express or tacit) consent –\nlike terms of captivity in general – follows upon (a just) war\n(DJN VI.1.9, 1.12; VI.3.5–6). Though its end differs from that\nof the state (reproduction vs. security), the marital unification of\nwills may establish a hierarchical, quasi-sovereignty relationship\nbetween spouses, one of whom agrees to submit to the other’s\nauthority; on the other hand, marriage may have the character of an\n“unequal confederation,” which also requires diverse but\nmutual performance (i.e., command and obedience; DJN VI.1.11). What is\nimpermissible in both cases and institutions, however, because of its\nsupposed dysfunctionality for governance, is a divided command or two\nheads. \nThis forces a choice upon Pufendorf’s contractual\negalitarianism, which is tempered here by his material assumptions\nabout the “preeminence” of the husband’s sex, and\nabout women’s allegedly unreasonable demand for additional\nresponsibilities. These are not absolute pronouncements, however, but\nconclusions of the “ruling prudence” that is the\n“pleasant sister of natural law”; that is, they rest upon\nan empirical, pragmatic assessment of spouses’ respective\nabilities and burdens (DJN VI.1.11,18). It is important to recall in\nthis context the difference between modern and medieval natural law,\nand that Pufendorf does not conceive human nature in essentialist\nterms but rather generalizes (rightly or wrongly) from experience.\nThat is, apart from his personal presuppositions, his is an empirical\nand not a metaphysical argument, and this makes it both circumstantial\nand corrigible. To dismiss it out of hand ironically risks reaffirming\nthe very approach that he rejected (in general), and to overlook the\nflexibility and liberatory potential of his conception of natural law\n(Drakopolou 2013). \nBesides, Pufendorf reassures, in marriages and states alike,\nsovereignty does not exclude the possibility of mutual affection, and\nspouses do not command each other in all respects but only those that\nserve the institution’s fundamental end. Thus, matters like the\ndisposition of a wife’s dowry and other assets depend on the\nstipulations of the original marriage agreement (DJN VI.1.11), much\nlike the preliminary constraints imposed upon limited civil\nsovereignty by a state’s fundamental laws. Pufendorf also\nextends his analysis into the controversial subject of polygamy\n– which he deemed rationally elusive and sometimes permissible\n(DJN VI.1.16–18; Vogel 1991) – and into the topic of\ndivorce, where he qualifies Milton’s views on the subject (DJN\nVI.1.24; Palladini 2001). These and other discussions are historically\nand circumstantially embedded, which accounts for their considerable\nlength and detail, especially when compared with shorter treatments in\nother early modern authors like Hobbes and Locke. Textual comparisons\nwith these can be useful and enlightening (Sreedhar 2014), especially\nif historical and philosophical contexts are also kept in view\n(Doyé 2012, Hull 1996, Buchholz 1988, Rinkens 1971, Dufour\n1972). \nOne human institution generates and qualifies another as the parental\nrole supervenes on that of marital partner. Here Pufendorf follows\nHobbes in holding that mere generation cannot ground parental\nauthority (just as place of birth alone cannot ground patriotism), and\nthat this depends instead on a tacit pact based on utility (DJN\nVI.2.2). Children supposedly assent to their subjection in order to\nsurvive, and because otherwise the beneficial ends of parenthood,\nwhich include the rearing, socializing, and civic education of\noffspring, cannot be attained. Moreover, he concurs, though mothers\nhave primary authority over children in the state of nature where\nparents are roughly equal, fathers typically acquire supremacy through\nmarriage pacts, which may be dictated by civil laws (DJN\nVI.2.4–5). As in the spousal relationship and for similar\nreasons, parents cannot be equally authoritative or sovereign\nvis-a-vis their children, but one or the other must prevail. Though\nthis is usually the male, Pufendorf excepts Amazons and contemporary\nqueens in whom the civil sovereignty reposes for dynastic reasons, and\nwhose husbands are not kings but mere “spouses of queens.”\n(DJN VI.2.5) Also, like marital authority, parental power is limited\nby the institution’s end and normally excludes the right of life\nand death, and the ability to void grown children’s marriages.\n(DJN VI.2.14) It ceases when children come of age and are emancipated,\nthough (as in the case of emigration, DJN VIII.11.3–4) it may be\nextended beyond that point because of special circumstances, including\nother pacts. Children always owe their parents imperfect duties of\nequity and gratitude (DJN VI.2.11). \nHerilic or master-slave relationships are similar to but stricter than\nparental ties, and they have no natural expiration point. They too are\nbased on express or tacit pacts, with no natural basis beside the\nqualifying suitability of some persons to rule and others to be ruled\n(DJN VI.3.1–2) – which, alone, is insufficient to justify\nthem. Pufendorf conceives them as sovereignty- rather than as\nproperty-relationships (DJN VI.3.7), strictly speaking, and regards\nslaves not as things but as “perpetual mercenaries” (DJN\nVI.3.4) who always retain an “intrinsic liberty of the\nwill” (DJN VI.3.10). Slavery (or servitude – the category\nis wider or more diverse than often acknowledged) does not extinguish\nthe laws of humanity or erase all traces of humans’ original\nequality, even though it is possible for them to bargain away\n(permanently) their freedom to command themselves (DJN VI.3.9). Even\nthe offspring of slaves may be retained in that status, especially\nwhen it has been entered through war, although humanity (vs. right)\nfavors their liberation. States may regulate herilic relationships\nlike marital and parental ties, for appropriate reasons, even though\nthey often do not interfere. Slavery may be ended by manumission,\nbanishment, a failure to specify the status of slaves in one’s\nwill, and – notably – by putting a slave into chains\n(except for a crime, or as punishment). In the last case and any other\nunjustified deprivation of bodily freedom, a slave is released from\nhis initial, pact-based obligation, which depends on reciprocity:\n“For there is no pact unless contractors trust each other, and\nfaith cannot be violated where it does not exist.” That is,\nphysical bonds replace or sublate moral ones, and in such a case a\nslave is free to go (i.e., run away) (DJN VI.3.6, 3.11). These reasons\nare similar to those why the civil bond between ruler and ruled may be\nbroken. \nPufendorf’s political philosophy or doctrine of the state,\nincluding the latter’s internal and external functions, is\ncontinuous and consistent with his ethics; in fact, they are not\nreally distinct. Both rest on the same natural law foundation, namely\nthe sociality law which regulates not only pre-civil relations,\ninstitutions, and societies but also the civil condition needed to\nsecure them. As thoroughly social beings who are incapable of living\nalone, humans are subject to sociality’s requirements at all\nstages of their lives, both temporally and organizationally, and the\nestablishment of political authority does not leave morality and its\nobligations behind but rather facilitates and extends their reach. The\ntempered realism of the political sphere is not a forced abandonment\nof moral norms but an articulation of the natural law’s demands\namid the increasing complexities of collective human existence,\nincluding its inevitable constraints, exclusions, and compromises. In\nPufendorf’s natural law theory, politics is a form of social\nethics. \nSpeaking generally (since the formation of individual states varies\ngreatly), the moral entity of ‘the state’ is self-imposed\nby humans at the command of natural law when their pre-civil marital,\nparental, and particularly herilic associations – as well as\nother pact-based institutions such as property – become\ndysfunctional because of multiplying conflicts that lead increasingly\nto the unjustified use of force and, thus, reciprocal injury and\ninsecurity. It is a defensive and precautionary response to such\nemergent conditions, a kind of cooperative scheme\n(conspiratio) or mutual protection association created as\nneeded against the growing threat posed by other human beings (DJN\nVII.2.1–2). Contra Aristotle, the state is not a natural or\nideal stage of human development emerging spontaneously from\nhumans’ desire to live together (DJN VII.1.2–3), but an\nadventitious, willed self-help device broadly enjoined by natural law\nin either or both a prudential (i.e., recommended by sound reason) or\ndeontological (i.e., commanded by God) sense (DJN VII.3.2). It is not\nrequired to eliminate human need (indigentia) in the\npre-cultural natural state, since cities and other forms of\nassociation usually suffice for that (DJN VII.1.3 and 6; Brett 2011).\nRather it secures these social arrangements and their cultural gains\nin the context of increased human numbers, relative scarcity and\ncompetition, growing disagreements, and the ensuing insecurity that\ncomes from the interaction of individually weak and imperfectly social\nbeings. \nState formation is explicitly driven by fear, and there is ample\nreference to human wickedness, self-concern, and a willingness to\ninjure in Pufendorf’s sketch of the pre-civil condition (DJN\nVII.1–2). Still, his comments are qualified even here, in\nopposition to Hobbes, and they do not amount to an anthropological\nclaim about the exclusive selfishness of all human beings –\nwhich is not needed for the argument (DJN VII.1.5, 7–8). In\nfact, the discussion of pre-civil conditions and institutions clearly\ntempers such pessimism. For while those arrangements rely on formal\npromises and pacts, they are also induced by and certainly compatible\nwith mutual affection, a desire for friendship, and the enjoyment of\nconviviality (DJN VII.1.5, 2.4; VIII.4.3, 6.2; II.2.7, 3.16). To be\nsure, such means and motives become increasingly incapable of\nmaintaining them, as the complex feelings regulating smaller, simpler,\nand more intimate human interactions evolve into a cruder and colder\npsychology of scale among composite moral persons or groups. That is,\nwith the reduction of familiarity, predictability, and commonality of\npurpose comes a sort of primitivizing of motives in the direction of\nfear. Still, Pufendorf’s state is not built on a thick,\nessentialist, or teleological (philosophical or theological)\nanthropology – even of a negative sort – but on an\nempirical, historical, or realistic assessment of actual human\naffairs. This means both that the state’s minimalist function as\na mutual protection agency may not be controlled or overridden by\nother, substantive (e.g., religious, ethical) ends, but also that,\nsince fear does not necessarily eliminate other human motives but only\nsuppresses or distorts or overrules them, the state as guarantor of\nmutual security may actually allow these to function (again) in their\nproper (subordinate) contexts. \nBeside its sovereignty, what distinguishes Pufendorf’s state\nfrom other pact-based institutions is its size (DJN VII.2.2) –\nthat is, its numbers must suffice for security in particular social\nand historical circumstances – and, more importantly, its manner\nof formation. Conceptually, it owes its origin to two agreements and\nan intervening decree (DJN VII.2.7–8). An initial contract of\nassociation occurs when members of a multitude, or the would-be\ncitizens (in practice, family-fathers or patriarchs, who are the\nprimary or direct citizens: DJN VII.2.20, 5.12), agree with one\nanother to bond together for mutual security. This requires the\naccession of all (full or formal) members of the resultant group, who\nconsent to it either absolutely or conditionally depending on whether\nthey agree individually to bind themselves to any form of state\nselected by the majority, or only to a certain, preapproved form\nsatisfactory to themselves. In either case, the band (coetus)\nthus constituted still lacks unity and has only “the rudiments\nand beginnings of a state” (DJN VII.2.7; Pufendorf 1994a, p.\n212), although it suffices to prevent an immediate return to the state\nof nature if the second pact is temporarily suspended, as during an\ninterregnum (DJN VII.7.6–7, VIII.11.1). \nThe second pact follows the selection (via the pragmatic expedient of\nmajority vote; see Pasquino 2010, Schwartzberg 2008) of the specific\nform of state to be instituted (monarchy, aristocracy, or democracy),\nand through it each citizen of the future state subjects himself to\nthe specific governing agent thereby established. It is needed to\nprevent the random defection and individual exceptionalism that\nthreaten all pre-civil agreements (DJN VII.2.3, 10), including the\nfirst contract. At this stage or level, the individual contractors\nunite their wills through separate promises of obedience to a new\nmoral persona equipped with distinctive (i.e., not simply transferred)\nrights and obligations, and capable of using their combined strength\nto discipline, compel, and thus govern effectively (DJN VII.2.5, 3.4,\n8.5; cf. VI.1.12; Boucher 1998, Skinner 2002). Civil subjection is\nanalogous to herilic subjection or slavery, though more focused in\nintent, more limited in scope, and – because of reciprocal\npromises between governors and governed – potentially sublatable\nin narrowly defined and (thinks Pufendorf) avoidable circumstances\n(DJN VII.3.1, 2.10; Seidler 1996). Moreover, in combining a title to\ncommand with the strength to sanction or compel, it also recalls the\ngeneral structure and rationale of the moral obligation that enjoins\nhumans to constitute it in the first place (cf. DJN VII.3.1, 2.13;\nI.6.9, 6.12; and Section 3.2 above). \nLike Bodin and Hobbes, Pufendorf identified sovereignty\n(imperium) as the “vivifying and sustaining soul”\nof the state. It is a new moral quality that emerges from the\nrespective commitments of rulers and ruled, consisting of the\nformer’s right to command and the latter’s duty to obey.\n(DJN VII.3.1–2: Pufendorf 1994a, pp. 217–18; VII.4.12;\nHolland 2012) Like other souls, as it were, sovereignty comes from God\n(as author of the natural law), though only indirectly in this case,\nor through the instrumentality of reasoning human beings. Thus,\nthroughout Book VII of DJN Pufendorf rejects the arguments of J. F.\nHorn (Politicorum pars architectonica de civitate [1664]),\nthe German Filmer. Natural law bestows sovereignty on no one form of\ngovernment or on specific individuals or groups; instead, such\ndecisions are made by human contractors in particular circumstances.\nIt is always required, however, that sovereignty be supreme in the\nsense that there be no superior or equivalent powers within the state.\nAlso, sovereignty cannot be divided, since that would fragment the\nunity of will that undergirds the state as an effective authority (DJN\nVII.4.11). Accordingly, all governing functions, including\nlegislative, judicial, penal, economic, and war-related powers must\nultimately reside in the same persona or agency. Otherwise (as in the\nHoly Roman Empire whose political diseases Pufendorf diagnosed in\nThe Present State of Germany (Monz.) the state would have two\nor more heads and, by reproducing the conflicts of the pre-civil\ncondition, would invite its own destruction. \nStates where sovereignty is unified – whatever be their form\n(monarchy, aristocracy, democracy) – are called regular, and\nthose where it is divided irregular (DJN VII.5.2, 5.14–15).\nIrregularity always weakens a state, but each form also has its own\ndifficulties and weaknesses. Pufendorf does not in principle prefer\none regular form over another: God is the author of free states\n(democracies) and monarchies alike (DJN VII.5.5), and sovereignty or\nmajesty belongs equally to all states and not just to monarchies (DJN\nVII.3.3). However, humans incline differently toward particular forms\nof state (DJN VII.5.11), and it is up to them to decide which ones to\nimplement for themselves (DJN VII.3.2). In fact, the choice appears to\nbe prudential in nature, since certain forms of state may require\nspecific human dispositions to function effectively (DJN VII.6.5), and\nsome forms may be more suited for particular settings. Thus, large\nterritories with scattered populations are better ruled as monarchies,\nwhile smaller regions or city-states can be governed well as\ndemocracies (DJN VII.5.22). More generally, monarchy may be more\nefficient because of the simple logistics of human association (DJN\nVII.5.9). Beside such forms and conditions, each type of state is also\nprone to other faults or illnesses peculiar to itself, which Pufendorf\ndistinguishes into “vices of men” and “vices of\nstatus” (DJN VII.5.10). The former obtain, for instance, when\n(in a monarchy) rulership goes to someone unqualified for that role,\nand the latter when (in a democracy) citizens are too self-assertive\nand unwilling to compromise. The fact remains that even though states\nare a remedy for human weakness and imperfection, as human constructs\nthey always remain an imperfect one (DJN VII.5.22). \nThis problem cannot be avoided or lessened by mixing forms of state, a\ntraditional expedient (Riklin 2006, Scattola 2009b, Zurbuchen 2009)\nthat Pufendorf rejects because of the irregularities it produces. For\nmixing yields either an entity that is no state at all, because it is\nheld together by a mere agreement (without subjection), or one that\napproximates a system of independent states, else something\n‘monstrous’ in between (DJN VII.5.12–13). Pufendorf\ndoes allow, though, for a distinction between forms of state and forms\nof administration. Thus, a monarch may utilize executive mechanisms\nthat are aristocratic or democratic in nature, and similarly for other\nforms of state (DJN VII.5.1, 5.13). The crucial defining factor in\neach instance is the unity and locus of ultimate authority, not how\nits commands are executed or policies implemented. Such arrangements\ndiffer from so-called systems of (sovereign) states, which themselves\nexhibit regular and irregular forms depending on the way their\ncollective authority is exercised. By discussing them Pufendorf\nextends his analysis to the international sphere (DJN\nVII.5.17–21; see Seidler 2011). \nContra Hobbes, Pufendorf allows that supreme sovereignty (summum\nimperium) may be either absolute or limited (DJN VII.6.7). The\nformer obtains where a sovereign accepts his (her, or its) authority\nwith no conditions attached, the latter where citizens’\nsubmission depends on the sovereign’s initial acceptance of\ncertain terms, such as an existing state’s fundamental laws.\nThese can be violated by the eventual sovereign, making his actions\ninjurious or illegitimate (DJN VII.8.2–4, 6.10), even though\nsubjects are not typically – except in extremis –\nin a position to deny him obedience for this reason because it would\nundermine the important end of sovereignty altogether (DJN\nVII.8.5–6). Given human imperfections, Pufendorf clearly favors\nlimited sovereignty; however, and for the same reasons, while he\ncriticizes the abuse of absolute sovereignty he also criticizes\nirrational fear thereof (DJN VII.6.8–13). Again, there is no\nuniversal recommendation but all depends on what is needed in\nparticular historical circumstances where such choices present\nthemselves. \nThe state or sovereign necessarily controls all sub-state collectives,\nincluding economic, political, and religious associations, especially\nif they compete with it for citizens’ allegiance (DJN\nVII.2.21–24). Though piety is a personal matter between the\ndeity and individual believers, its official mediation by ecclesial\nentities or churches, which also direct and organize human actions,\nhas a worldly impact that may interfere with the state’s\nfunctions (which are also divinely enjoined) – as Pufendorf\nargued by reference to the history of Catholicism and the\npapacy’s role in European affairs (Einl., ch. 12, 2013; also\n[1839, 1714, 1691b]). Therefore, sovereigns have the right (and\nobligation) to regulate religious organizations, to examine beliefs,\nand even to foster an official religion – though only to insure\ncompatibility with political order (DJN VII.4.11, 9.4). In fact, like\npublic schools (if they do not merely perpetuate scholastic\nsubtleties), religion may also aid the process of civic formation\n– which is required because states are adventitious moral\nentities devised by humans for a particular purpose, and because\n(good) citizens are not born but made (DJN VII.1.3–4). However,\nsince they are disparate institutions regulating different moral\npersonae (citizens, believers), neither state nor church exists\nprimarily to serve the other’s purposes. The state’s\ngeneral authority regarding religion, and its sovereignty over all\nreligious groups alike, also creates room for the toleration of\nreligious minorities and thus restrains destabilizing confessional\nconflict (Seidler 2002, Zurbuchen 2013, Lehmann 2013, Palladini\n1997b). Though Pufendorf had not yet arrived at Christian\nThomasius’ notion of a deconfessionalized state (Hunter 2007),\nhis historical awareness of religion’s impact on government, and\nits frequent contribution to political factionalism, made him wary of\nindependent religious institutions and inclined to favor state\noversight. In any case, since they issue from the same warranting\ndeity, he held that ultimately true politics and true (religious)\ndoctrine cannot conflict (DJN VII.4.8, 4.11). \nDespite its natural law foundation, a state’s positive laws will\nonly partially overlap with natural law. That is, since its purpose is\nnot to make humans perfect but secure, only those natural laws without\nwhich peace among citizens would be impossible should also become\ncivil laws (DJN VIII.1.1, III.4.6). In fact, by focusing on the\nrequirements of human association rather than on personal formation,\nthe sociality principle makes Pufendorf a legal minimalist more\ngenerally, so that even where the natural law is silent or indifferent\n“civil laws should not sanction more things than conduce to the\ngood of the citizens [as such] and the state” (DJN VII.9.5;\nPufendorf 1994a, p. 242). Besides, and within this narrow focal area,\nit also grants legislators considerable discretion or flexibility of\napplication. Thus, even though civil laws should not explicitly\ncontravene natural law, it is sometimes excusable if they redefine or\n“overlook” (dissimulare) certain practices\n– like theft, dueling, and tacitly accepted cuckoldry –\nfor which “the condition of the times and the genius of a\npeople” do not provide a current remedy (DJN VIII.1.3). Such\npractical adjustments are evident throughout Pufendorf’s\ndetailed discussions of state laws in DJN VIII – regarding\npunishment, social status (esteem), property, and war – which\nare strongly prudentialist, consequentialist, and realist in\ncharacter. They evince not a substantive moralism but the same\nflexible ‘reason-of-state’ approach that also guides his\nthinking about inter-state relations. Indeed, through their common\ngrounding in the sociality principle, natural, civil, and\ninternational law are in continuity and in dialogue with one another\n– though in a complex and sometimes untidy way (DJN II.3.23).\nThat is, though as a broad divine injunction natural law is presumed\nto be ultimately consistent, in practice (as specifically interpreted\nby particular humans) it often appears less so; for its demands must\nalways be articulated in full view of not only human psychology but\nalso the concrete settings in which human action occurs. (Thus, as in\nthe case of immigration [section 3.5 above], Pufendorf could condemn\nthe 1640s English revolution, while approving that in 1688. See\nSeidler 2001.) \nThis requirement is also evident in Pufendorf’s long discussion\nof the sovereign’s right to punish (DJN VIII.3, Hüning\n2009b). Punishment presupposes a superior, and so (in contrast to\nLocke) it cannot occur in either the pre-civil or the international\nstate of nature (DJN VIII.3.1–2, 3.7). Of course, both\nindividuals and states have a right to defend themselves or wage\ndefensive (and, in limited circumstances, preemptive) war, but neither\nof these is to be construed as punishment strictly speaking. The\nlatter is, instead, a means of social control available only to\nsovereigns for the specific purpose of restraint, deterrence, and\nreform (DJN VIII.3.9). In their hands, moreover, it is more future-\nthan past-oriented, with the latter being important only for the sake\nof the former: that is, one should not pointlessly impose evil on\nsomeone, even if guilty, if the deed cannot be undone or the damage\nrepaired, for he remains after all our conspecific or fellow human\nbeing (cognato) (DJN VIII.3.8). Those who have injured\nanother certainly owe a duty of reparation, as well as assurances\nabout future behavior, but they are under no obligation to submit to\npunishment (DJN VIII.3.4; see end of 4.1.3 above), which is imposed\nfor purely consequentialist reasons. Joining Hobbes, Pufendorf\ndismisses revenge as a “vain and unreasonable” motive (DJN\nVIII.3.8) for punishment, and he also dismisses Selden’s\n“satisfaction, purgation, or expiation” (DJN VIII.3.12) as\nunnecessary or meaningless notions. Moreover, he holds that penalties\nare not “owed to” or “deserved by” criminals,\nwho are unlikely to assert such a right (DJN VIII.3.5, 3.15).\nInstead,a sovereign’s resort to punishment should be guided by\nstate interest (as, in the case of a parent, by the interests of the\nfamily: DJN VIII.3.10), which also determines the quantity and quality\nof punishment needed (DJN VIII.3.23–24). The latter should never\nbe excessive but guided by the actual advantages to be gained (DJN\nVII.9.6–7). In some cases, punishment may even be foregone\naltogether if the interest of the state demands it (DJN VIII.3.14,\n16). This is because punishment is an instance of neither distributive\nnor commutative (expletive) justice, but a type of administrative\nsanction recommended by “prudence … conjoined with the\nduty to rule others” (DJN VIII.3.5). \nIn sum, Pufendorf’s analysis of punishment as a whole reflects\nthe positive and (re)constructive attitude of the law of nature, in\nboth pre- and post-civil conditions, particularly its injunctions to\nforgive, to accept apologies and reparations, and basically so to act\nas always to further and facilitate sociality (“inasmuch as [we]\ncan”), rather than to frustrate or make it impossible among\nhuman beings as we actually find them (DJN V.13.1; II.3.15, Pufendorf\n1994a, p. 152). As such, it appears far removed from more absolutist\nor categorical views of justice, such as the well-known statement (of\nKant in The Metaphysics of Morals [Die Metaphysik der\nSitten, 1797]) that a civil society must, before dissolving\nitself, execute every convicted murderer remaining in its prisons\n– a contrast that reveals well the gulf separating\nPufendorf’s natural law theory from essentialist or Platonizing\nviews (such as Leibniz’s) that challenged, and the Critical\nphilosophy that eventually replaced it (Hunter 2001, 2003a). \nPufendorf’s natural law thinking developed in close interaction\nwith his views on other subjects such as history, religion, and\ninternational relations; that is, his roles as academic philosopher,\ncourt historian, and political apologist were only formally and not\nintellectually distinct (Seidler 2015). This is as evident in the\nseminal reflections of his early Collegium Anthologicum\nlectures (in KVS 1995e, pp. 2–86) as it is in his later works.\nThus, the 1667 treatise on the Holy Roman Empire (Monz.) not only\nstudied its concrete history and institutions but also examined the\nimportance of sovereignty and state form, the tension between civil\nand ecclesiastical authority, and the challenge of foreign relations\nthat emerged from these. Pufendorf’s so-called works on religion\n(Habitu; Feciale; Einl. [1691b, 1714, 1839]) engaged the same topics,\nas well as associated questions about religious unification and\ntoleration, in the context of the early modern confessional state\n(Parkin and Stanton 2013; Döring 1998; Zurbuchen 1999, 1996,\n1991; Hüning 2002b). Even Pufendorf’s concretely situated\nand apparently partisan defenses of the Swedish interest (Discussio,\nOccas.) – which were sometimes regarded as merely contingent or\nopportunistic productions – exhibit the challenge (for\nparticular sovereigns and their historians) of applying the natural\nlaw’s general injunctions to specific historical circumstances.\nMost obviously, perhaps, his explicitly historical works –\nincluding the long accounts of Sweden (Gust. Ad., C. Gust.) and of\nBrandenburg (Fr. Wilh., Pufendorf 1784) that so distinguished him, but\nalso his famous Introductions (Einl. 1682, 1686b) –\ngive substance to and thus support his philosophical analysis of the\nstate (Seidler 1996 and 1997, Piirimäe 2008, Dufour 1991c,\nKrawczuk 2014). To be sure, the focus here is mainly on the external\nrelations and negotiations of particular states. But sovereigns must\nconduct these as judiciously and effectively as their states’\ninternal affairs, for it is useless to have internal peace if a state\nis externally weak (DJN VII.4.5). The two dimensions of statecraft are\nclearly linked throughout Pufendorf’s opus, which urges\nsovereigns (and those who create them) to consult both long- and\nshort-term interests of states, distinguishing the real from the\nmerely apparent ones (Einl., Preface, 2013), both to avoid the\n(re)emergence of an internal or external state of nature and, more\ngenerally, to satisfy the natural law’s injunction to further\nsociality among humans. \nPufendorf’s (Latin) style is clear and careful, though also\nsophisticated and colorful. For he not only mastered the art of\nexample but was also an aggressive, imaginative, and sometimes crass\npolemicist when attacked – especially when cornered, when the\nstakes were high, or when he deemed his opponents to be bellicose,\nlazy, or intellectually dishonest. This alone assured that he was\neagerly and widely read. Many of his works – including Monz.\n(1667), DJN (1672), DO (1673), Einl. (1682) – were published\nrepeatedly and translated into many European languages, both during\nhis lifetime and throughout most of the following century (Othmer\n1970, Luig 1972, Denzer 1972, Laurent 1982, Seidler 2013), when they\nbecame staples of university education. Of particular note in this\nextensive publication history were the influential French translations\nby Jean Barbeyrac, whose long notes to DJN and DO (including their\nLockean leanings) were partially assumed into the standard English\ntranslations of these works (if not immediately then in later\neditions), specifically those by Basil Kennet (DJN 1729) and Andrew\nTooke (DO 1735). In fact there was considerable interest in Pufendorf\nin England (starting with Tyrrell and Locke – see Tyrrell 1681,\nesp. pp. 236–59, and Thompson 1987), which also saw translations\nof various other works, including The Present State of\nGermany (Monz 1690, 1696), The History of Popedom (Einl.\n[1691]), the Introduction (Einl. 1695), Of the Nature and\nQualification of Religion, in Reference to Civil Society (Habitu\n1698), and The Divine Feudal Law (Feciale 1703). These and\nother translations are currently being reissued by Liberty Fund, Inc.\nas part of its Natural Law and Enlightenment Classics series,\nand are readily available in its Online Library of Liberty.\n(See Other Internet Resources below.) Pufendorf’s three main\nnatural law works (including the early EJU) were also reprinted and\nretranslated in the early twentieth century as part of the Carnegie\nEndowment’s Classics of International Law series, and\nare still occasionally reissued in this form (EJU 1995a, 1995b [2009];\nDJN 1995c, 1995d; DO 1995g, 1995h). However, there was never a\ncollective edition of Pufendorf’s works in any language, before the ongoing Gesammelte Werke (GW) issued by the Akademie Verlag (Walter de Gruyter). This edition includes as Vol. 1 (BW 1996) the extant correspondence which, though limited in comparison to other early moderns like Leibniz, is nonetheless very useful, especially in conjunction with the polemical\nessays in Eris Scandica (ES 2002b), which add biographical\nand literary details. The shorter works collected by Döring (KVS 1995e) are not included in GW, which does or will, however, contain Feciale\n(2004), Habitu (2016), DAS (1675b), and Monz.(1667). Since the long\nnational histories are now easily obtainable in facsimile form or as\nscans (see ZVDD and Gallica, in Other Internet Resources below), all\nof Pufendorf’s known writings will soon be readily available to\nscholars in some contemporary form. \nThe discourse of natural law became the lingua franca of\n18th-century moral, political, and social (including economic –\nHont 1987, 2005; Skinner 1995) thought (Haakonssen 2012; see section\n2.1 above, and “Natural Law 1625–1850: Database” in\nOther Internet Resources below). Pufendorf contributed much thereto by\ninitiating the self-referential genre of the ‘history of natural\nlaw’, wherein he located himself in relation to Grotius, Hobbes\nand other predecessors (Sample of Controversies [Specimen\ncontroversiarum], 1678, Ch. 1: “On the Origin and Progress\nof the Discipline of Natural Law”; later included in Eris\nScandica (ES 1686). His modest beginning was much enlarged by\nBarbeyrac in “An Historical and Critical Account of the Science\nof Morality …,” the Preface to his 1706 translation of\nPufendorf’s DJN (2005 [1729]), and by Pufendorf’s German\nfriend and disciple, Christian Thomasius, in his Nearly Complete\nHistory of Natural Law (Paulo plenior historia juris\nnaturalis, 1719), as well as many others in the 18th century\n(Glafey 1965 [1739]; see Hochstrasser 2000, pp. 65–71). As in\nPufendorf himself, a major theme of the genre was that of sociality\n(sociability, benevolence), which was variously interpreted,\ncriticized, and defended in both secular and religious contexts\n(Chiodi 2009, Piirimäe and Schmidt 2015). The notion’s\nappeal in the British domain – where a way had been prepared by\nRichard Cumberland (1632–1718, Cumberland 2005), whom Pufendorf\ncited repeatedly in the 1684 edition of DJN – is demonstrated by\nGershom Carmichael’s (1672–1729) influential student\nedition (1718) of Pufendorf’s De officio (Carmichael\n2002), and by the inaugural lecture “On the Natural Sociality of\nMen” (1730) of his student and successor at Glasgow, Francis\nHutcheson (1694–1746), whose thought was strongly influenced by\nnatural law (Hutcheson 1993, 2006, 2007). So too were many other\nBritish moralists and social theorists, especially in the so-called\nScottish Enlightenment, including George Turnbull (1698–1748),\nJohn Millar (1735–1801), Thomas Reid (1710–1796), and Adam\nSmith (1723–1790) (Haakonssen 1996, Moore and Silverthorne 1983,\nMoore 2006). Through them and others, including direct exposure to\nPufendorf’s own, often reprinted works, natural law thought also\nbecame part of the intellectual inheritance of the American Revolution\nand constitutionalism (Welzel 1952, White 1978, Augat 1985, Heideking\n1995, Haakonssen 1991, Logan 2013). \nOn the Continent, Pufendorf’s influence was felt during the 18th\ncentury through the so-called civil enlightenment of C. Thomasius and\nhis school, and through the frequent republication and study of his\nown works. Their juridical approach to natural law persisted until the\nend of the century, especially in German law faculties (Lestition\n1989, Klippel 2009, Schröder 2010), where it provided a\ncounterweight to the metaphysical, perfectionist, and in a sense\nneoscholastic tradition of natural law associated with Leibniz and\nChristian Wolff (1679–1754) (Hunter 2007, 2003a, 2001;\nLutterbeck 2002, Haakonssen 2006, Ikadatsu 2002, Ottmann 2006, Schmidt\n2007, Schneider 2001). Pufendorf himself maintained a presence not\nonly through his natural law works but also the historical writings,\nespecially the many versions of his Introduction (Einl.\n1682), which was continually revised and appropriated by others to\nsuit the times, until nearly the end of the century (Seidler 2013).\nIndeed, it was largely through this work and those of its editors,\ncommentators, and imitators, including Nikolaus Hieronymus Gundling\n(1671–1729) and Johann Peter Lud[e]wig (1668–1743), that\nPufendorf entered the 18th-century discourse about the relation of\nlaw, politics, and history, and stayed relevant as an international\ntheorist. His empirically grounded mix of history, philosophy, and law\nled also into cameralism (Brückner 1977), into the so-called\nGöttingen School (Hammerstein 1972 and 1986, Vierhaus 1987), and\nto the associated discipline of Statistik (statistics, from\nthe Italian statista [statesman] and ragion di\nstato), with its focus on the concrete institutions and functions\nof states (Zande 2010, Valera 1986, Pasquino 1986). This included\nGottfried Achenwall (1719–1772), on whom Kant lectured for many\nyears during both his pre-Critical and Critical periods (Achenwall\n1762, Hruschka 1986, Streidl 2000). Moreover, it underlay the\ncentury’s legal codification schemes, which attempted still to\nbase positive on natural law in some sense (Hartung 1998, Ferronato\n2005). In an equally broad sort of way, Pufendorf was also predecessor\nto Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui (1694–1748) and Emmerich de Vattel\n(1714–1767), whose respective works on natural and international\nlaw were notable examples of the genre, albeit ones also influenced by\nits Wolffian version. Moreover, Pufendorf and natural law were present\nin the Encyclopédie (Schröder 2001, Burns 1999),\nas well as in the prehistory of the French Revolution (Caradonna 2006,\nEdelstein 2014). Finally, Pufendorf’s theory of the state had a\nsignificant formative influence on specific thinkers like Rousseau,\nwho criticized him and other “friends of despotism” for\nundermining human freedom while nonetheless borrowing heavily from his\npolitical conceptions (McAdam 1963, Derathé 1992, Wokler 1994,\nSilvestrini 2010, Douglass 2015). \nKant’s Critical philosophy does not distinguish clearly between\nthe rather different streams of natural law that it is usually thought\nto have surpassed (Hochstrasser 2000, Hartung 1998, Haakonssen 2006).\nIndeed, when Kant arrived on the scene the two had already been\nthoroughly commingled, and the discipline as a whole straddled an\nuncomfortable position between the rational and the empirical. Its\nsituation now became increasingly precarious, as it was subjected to\nepistemological and metaphysical challenges that it had not been\ndesigned to meet, and whose purist, a priori assumptions it would\nreject (Hunter 2001, 2002, 2005). Like much else, Kant effectively\nfolded natural law into the dialectical pre-history of his own system.\nIn fact, he hardly mentions it at all, since it does not fit the\nformal schematic of his conception of the history of philosophy as a\nconflict between dogmatic rationalism and sceptical empiricism. In\nethics, natural law is implicitly dismissed in the critique of\ntechnical and prudential imperatives, and in political philosophy it\nappears similarly wanting in the face of pure Right. To be sure,\nKant’s own views in both areas – including the notion of\ncategorical obligation, the historical-political mechanism of\n’unsocial sociability’, and the trademark concept of\n‘autonomy’ mediated by Rousseau’s General Will\n– owed significant debts to Pufendorf and the voluntarist\ntradition (Schneewind 1993, 2009, 2010; Kersting 2006). However, since\nhis system gave that problematic a new (in)significance, it did not\nplay an explicit role in his discussions. Kant’s sole mention of\nPufendorf (in the company of Grotius and Vattel) is a vague and\ndismissive reference to the “wretched comforters”\n(leidige Tröster) who are criticized – in the\nessay on Perpetual Peace (Zum ewigen Frieden, 1795)\n– for their overly flexible, empirical, and situational\ntreatment of the law of nations (ius gentium). Ironically,\nthat approach (including sovereigns’ resort to prudence and the\nright of necessity) had previously been considered a strength, but\nKant saw it as little more than a recipe for endless war. In its\nplace, he substituted a universal, necessary, and absolute metaphysics\nof right – albeit in a transcendental vein – precisely of\nthe sort that the ‘modern’ natural law theory of Hobbes\nand Pufendorf had originally sought to displace because of its\npernicious social consequences.  \nThe actual refutation or, rather, historical erasure of natural law\nwas the work of post-Kantian historians like C. F. Stäudlin\n(1761–1826), J. G. Buhle (1763–1807), and W. G. Tennemann\n(1761–1819), whose versions of the history of moral philosophy\nironically left Grotius, Pufendorf and Thomasius (Barbeyrac’s\nprotagonists) with only minor roles to play. Even so, natural law\nremained a presence in the nineteenth century. Thus, Fichte (The\nFoundations of Natural Law [Grundlage des Naturrechts nach\nPrinzipien der Wissenschaftslehre, 1796–97]), Schelling\n(A New Deduction of Natural Law [Neue Deduction des\nNaturrechts, 1797]), and the young Hegel (The Scientific Ways\nof Treating Natural Law [Über die wissenschaftlichen\nBehandlungsarten des Naturrechts, 1802–3]) all published\nworks on “natural law” (Naturrecht) –\nshowing that the idiom remained serviceable (Klippel 1997, 2012). In\nthe British domain, insofar as it was not also\n‘idealized’, Bentham’s vague and dismissive attitude\ntoward ‘natural rights’, and the comparatively\ncircumscribed ‘ethics’ of Mill’s utilitarianism,\nfound little connection with modern natural law, even through its own\neighteenth-century inheritance which that approach had helped to\nshape. The rebirth of Thomism in the Catholic world toward the end of\nthe century, and the permutation of natural into human rights before\nand after the First World War, made the disjunction and the amnesia\ncomplete. \nThis debate continues, albeit in different registers and with\nequivocal notions of ‘natural law’. For about half of the\ntwentieth century (in philosophy, law, and international relations),\nnatural law referred to a revived Scholasticism or Neo-Thomism. This\nwas joined after mid-century by the ‘secular’ natural law\nof John Finnis (1940– ) and Robert P. George (1955– ),\nlater by the naturalism (or neo-Aristotelianism) of Amartya Sen\n(1933– ) and Martha Nussbaum (1947– ), and most recently\nby a new kind of Protestant natural law with roots in\nsixteenth-century Reformed theology (Grabhill 2006, VanDrunen 2010,\nWitte Jr. 2008). All these approaches involve essentialist claims of\nsorts, even if empirically supported, and together with a Kantian\nmetaphysics of the person that is variously present in versions of\nJohn Rawls (1921–2002) and Jürgen Habermas (1929– )\nthey provide ontological, procedural, or constructivist foundations\nfor discourse about human rights and dignity, and support for\ninternational organizations and mechanisms that police them.\nAccordingly, the supposed ‘right to punish’ is in full\nforce again, as are duties to assist, to rescue, and the like –\nunderstandably so. However, despite attempts to enlist Pufendorf in\nsuch causes by finding the prehistory of pivotal notions like rights,\ndignity, and equality in his texts (Saastamoinen 2010, Fiorillo 2013a,\nMüller 2011), his natural law is actually more akin to contrarian\napproaches like the neo-Hobbesianism of Carl Schmitt\n(1888–1985), the agonism of Chantal Mouffe (1943–) and\nJames Tully (1946–), the realism of Raymond Geuss (1946–\n), and even the pragmatic naturalism of Philip Kitcher (1947– ).\nThese perspectives are not necessarily opposed to the practical aims\nof the views they oppose and criticize, it may be useful to note (also\nabout Pufendorf), but merely insist upon fewer suppositions, less\npresumption, and more modest goals.
