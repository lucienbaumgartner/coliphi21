His six-book Latin hexameter\npoem De rerum natura (DRN for short), variously\ntranslated On the nature of things and On the nature of\nthe universe, survives virtually intact, although it is disputed\nwhether he lived to put the finishing touches to it. As well as being\na pioneering figure in the history of philosophical poetry, Lucretius\nhas come to be our primary source of information on Epicurean physics,\nthe official topic of his poem. Among numerous other Epicurean\ndoctrines, the atomic ‘swerve’ is known to us mainly from\nLucretius’ account of it. His defence of the Epicurean system is\ndeftly and passionately argued, and is particularly admired for its\neloquent critique of the fear of death in book 3.\n\n\n\nWe know virtually nothing, beyond what little can be inferred from\nthe poem itself, of Lucretius’ biography. There is just one\ncontemporary reference to him (or near contemporary, depending on the\ndate of his death): it is found in a letter of Cicero, written in 54\nBCE, where he briefly agrees with his brother about the ‘flashes\nof genius’ and ‘craftsmanship’ that characterize\nLucretius’ poetry. \n\nWhat we can say for sure is that the poem is dedicated and addressed\nto a Roman aristocrat named Memmius, although it is not altogether\ncertain which member of the Memmius family this was. Lucretius\nexpresses a hope for Memmius’ friendship, but that does not rule out\nthe possibility of an asymmetric client-patron relation, as distinct\nfrom one of genuine social equality. \n\nThe other biographical data are late and untrustworthy. They put\nhis birth in 94 BCE, his death in either 54 or 51. (A case has even\nbeen made, by Hutchinson 2001, for dating his death later still, to\nthe early 40s BCE). We can, at all events, say with some confidence\nthat Lucretius wrote his poem in the mid first century BCE. \n\nBecause early Christianity branded Lucretius an enemy of religion,\nhis life and death had to be depicted as appropriately wretched. Thus,\naccording to St Jerome, he was driven mad by a love philtre, wrote\npoetry in his lucid intervals, and died by his own hand, leaving his\npoem to be edited posthumously by Cicero. This—apart from the\nlast detail, which some have found credible—is a palpable\nfabrication. Its portrayal of wretched insanity is implicitly\ncontradicted by Lucretius’ younger contemporary and admirer Virgil, who\nfelt able to write of him in his Georgics, a didactic poem\nheavily in Lucretius’ debt, the celebrated lines (2.490–2) ‘Happy\nhe who was able to know the causes of things (felix qui potuit\nrerum cognoscere causas), and who trampled beneath his feet all\nfears, inexorable fate, and the roar of devouring hell’. With\nthese admiring words, Virgil neatly encapsulates four dominant themes\nof the poem—universal causal explanation, leading to\nelimination of the threats the world seems to pose, a vindication of\nfree will, and disproof of the soul’s survival after death. But he\nalso, in advertising Lucretius’ philosophical understanding as his\nenviable source of happiness, makes it implausible that the author of\nDRN had by this date acquired his later reputation as a\nsuicidal psychotic. \n\nWhether or not the poem is altogether in the finished state that\nLucretius would have wanted, its six-book structure is itself clearly a\ncarefully planned one. It falls into three matching pairs of books: \n\nThe sequence is one of ascending scale: the first pair of books\ndeals with the microscopic world of atoms, the second with human\nbeings, the third with the cosmos as a whole. Within each pair of\nbooks, the first explains the basic nature of the entity or entities in\nquestion, the second goes on to examine a range of individual phenomena\nassociated with them. A further symmetry lies in the theme of\nmortality, treated by the odd-numbered books. Book I stresses from the\noutset the indestructibility of the basic elements, while books III and\nV in pointed contrast give matching prominence to the perishability and\ntransience of, respectively, the soul and the cosmos. \n\nIn addition to this division into three matching pairs of books, the\npoem can also be seen as constituted by two balanced halves,\norchestrated by the themes of life and death. It opens with a hymn to\nVenus as the force inspiring birth and life. The first half closes, at\nthe end of III, with Lucretius’ long and eloquent denunciation of the\nfear of death. And the poem as a whole returns at its close to the\ntheme of death, with the disquieting passage on the frightful Athenian\nplague during the Peloponnesian War: whether or not this, as we have\nit, is in its finished form, there can be little doubt that the placing\nof its theme itself somehow represents the author’s own\norchestration. \n\nThere has been much dispute over this ending. Some judge it a\npoetically effective closure as it stands, others believe that\nLucretius would, had he lived, at least have completed it with a\nsuitable moral. The former party maintains that Lucretius by this point\nin the poem is liable to leave readers to work out the moral for\nthemselves. On this, however, see further\n §5\nbelow. \n\nEpicurus founded his system in the late 4th and early 3rd\ncentury BCE, and it became one of the most influential of the\nHellenistic age. Lucretius lived in Italy in a period when\nEpicureanism flourished there, especially in the area of the Bay of\nNaples, where a major Epicurean circle had formed around\nPhilodemus. Philodemus’ library was rediscovered during the\n18th-century excavations of Herculaneum (recent claims to\nhave found remains of Lucretius’ poem among its badly\ndamaged contents may be unduly optimistic). In addition, the main\nEpicurean school was still flourishing in Athens, despite the\ndeparture of most other schools from their metropolitan headquarters\nthere, and it had other regional branches to which a Roman might\nequally well go for study. In any case, Epicureanism was by now one of\nthe four leading philosophical systems that any aspiring\nphilosophy student was expected to master. Romans who, against this\nbackground, became Epicureans included Cicero’s friend Atticus, and\nCassius, later an assassin of Caesar. It therefore becomes both easy\nand attractive to think of Lucretius’ turn to Epicureanism as part of\na trend among the Roman intelligentsia. Curiously, however, his poem\nshows few if any signs of contemporary philosophical or scientific\nengagement.  We know a good deal about recent trends in the Epicurean\nschool—for example, its sophisticated debates with the Stoics\non scientific method and mathematics—yet we find little or no\nevidence in Lucretius’ poem that he is aware of, let alone engaged in,\nthese developments. And although he includes a number of critiques of\nanonymous opponents, none of these opponents can plausibly be\nidentified with anyone who lived in the two centuries separating\nEpicurus’ own lifetime from Lucretius’, including adherents of the\nera’s most prestigious school, the Stoa. It may, then, be more\naccurate to think of Lucretius as philosophically isolated, drawing\nhis inspiration from Epicurus’ own treasured writings, and for that\nreason adopting Epicurus’ polemical targets as his own. \n\nThis alternative fits well with the apparent facts about Lucretius’\nuse of sources. So far as one can tell, the material on physics that he\nstarted from and reworked was all taken from the first fifteen books of\nEpicurus’ 37-book magnum opus, On nature. Thanks to the\naccidental survival in Lucretius’ book 4 of two alternative\nprogrammatic passages for the book, we can work out that what we call\nbook 4 was initially planned to come directly after book 2, a sequence\nof topics which would have exactly reproduced Epicurus’ own in On\nnature, and that it was only in a later phase that he reorganised\nhis material so that our book 3 came to intervene. This gives good\ngrounds for the guess that the relatively small number of other\ndemonstrable departures from Epicurus’ original sequence likewise\nrepresent the process by which, either while or after completing a\nfirst draft, Lucretius set about reorganising the poem’s contents into\nthe six-book structure we possess today. So far as one can tell, his\nrewriting of books 1–3 was complete, but that of books 4–6 was still\nunder way at the time of his death. (This is all argued at length in\nSedley 1998.) Among other signs of incompleteness, the latter three\nbooks are very long, and would probably have been cut down to something\nlike the length of books 1–3 in the final revision. \n\nBecause of the way he worked, there are grounds for confidence that,\nby and large, the central philosophical content of Lucretius’ poem\nclosely mirrors what he found in Epicurus. His departures from Epicurus\nare more in the matter of sequence than of doctrine or argument. This\nadherence to Epicurus’ own text is further confirmed by the reverent\ntones in which Lucretius speaks of his master’s writings: ‘I\nfollow you, glory of the Greek race, as in your footprints I now plant\nmy own, not so much out of any desire to compete with you as for love,\nfor my wish is to imitate you … You are our father, the\ndiscoverer of reality. You pass to us your paternal precepts, and from\nyour scrolls, glorious one, just as bees sip all they can find in the\nflowery glades, we likewise feed upon all of your golden \nwords—golden, and ever deserving of perpetual life’ (3.3–13). \n\nAt 1.921–50 (lines which later recur in part as the proem to book 4)\nLucretius sets out his poetic manifesto, declaring the revolutionary\nnovelty of his task. By this he means, no doubt, above all his task as\nthe first poet of Epicureanism. Philosophical poetry had been pioneered\nby the early Greek writers Xenophanes, Parmenides and Empedocles, the\nlast of whom Lucretius both reveres and imitates. But none before him\nhad written poetry in defence of Epicureanism, or for that matter (and\nLucretius may have this innovation in mind too) philosophical poetry in\nLatin. \n\nThere has been much discussion regarding the supposed unorthodoxy of\nan Epicurean writing philosophical verse, but it has not been\nestablished that Lucretius was breaking any school edict. Epicurus’ own\nhostility to poetry had, it seems, belonged in a tradition that went\nback at least to Plato, focusing on the morally harmful content of the\npoetry, by Homer and others, that played such a large part in the Greek\neducational curriculum. That versification as such was considered\nobjectionable in the school’s earlier tradition has not been shown.\nLucretius’ own explanation of his choice of a poetic medium is that\nphilosophy is medicine for the soul, and that the charms of verse can\nfunction like the honey that doctors smear on the rim of a cup of\nbitter medicine, to persuade children to drink it for their own good.\nFor, Lucretius loves to remind us, when it comes to fear of the\nunknown, we are all of us mere children, terrified of the dark. \n\nA feature germane to philosophical prose which Lucretius retains and\neven enhances in his verse is the carefully tabulated order of a series\nof arguments for each demonstrandum, even though additional, more\nrhetorical features of his argumentative techniques have been rightly\nnoted by scholars (e.g., Asmis 1983, Markovic 2008). Another is the defence of a\nhypothesis by appeal to analogy with familiar empirical data. This\nlatter procedure, integral to Epicurean methodology, presents Lucretius\nwith frequent occasion to develop rich and complex poetic \nsimiles—one of the most admired and appreciated aspects of his\nwriting. \n\nBook 1 sets out the fundamental principles of Epicurean atomism. \n\n1.149–482. First comes, in effect, Lucretius’ ontology.\nNothing comes into being out of nothing or perishes into nothing. The\nonly two per se entities are body and void; all other existing\nthings are inseparable or accidental properties of these (Lucretius’\nown terms for which are coniuncta and eventa\nrespectively). Two further items that might be suspected of existing\nindependently of any concurrently existing body or void, (1) time and\n(2) historical facts, are argued to be in fact existentially parasitic\non the presently existing world, and thus not after all per se\nexistents. \n\n1.483–634. Lucretius next turns to the basic truths of\nphysics. Body comes in minute and physically indivisible portions,\natoms—although Lucretius does not use this Greek loan-word, and\nprefers a series of circumlocutions such as ‘first beginnings of\nthings’ (primordia rerum), ‘seeds’, and\n‘matter’ (materies, derived from mater,\n‘mother’), which serve his poetic purposes by evoking the\ncreative powers of these primary particles. It is by their combination\ninto complex structures that all phenomenal beings are generated. \n\nEpicurus had attached enormous importance to the internal structure\nof atoms, which he held to consist of altogether partless magnitudes\ncalled ‘minima’. Lucretius condenses and largely edits out\nthis doctrine. What little he does say in support of it is mixed in\nwith his defence of atoms themselves (1.599–634), rather than exhibited\nas a separate part of the physical theory. Whether this policy reflects\nthe theory’s difficulty for himself or his readers, the economies\nentailed by keeping the overall subject matter within the chosen\nsix-book structure, or a theoretical difference from early\nEpicureanism, is destined to be a matter for speculation only. \n\n1.635–920. Lucretius now turns polemical, attacking in\nsequence three Presocratic philosophers representing three rival\nphysical systems as these had come to be classified in the\nAristotelian tradition: monism, finite pluralism and infinite\npluralism. Heraclitus, with his reduction of everything to fire, is\nthe token monist; Empedocles, with his four elements, represents\nfinite pluralism; and Anaxagoras, read through the lens of\nAristotelian doxography as making all the ‘homoeomerous’\nor ‘like-parted’ stuffs the elements, is treated as\nfundamentally sui generis. None of these thinkers had a\nsignificant, if indeed any, following in Lucretius’ day (even if\nHeraclitus had been accorded an honourable place in the prehistory of\nStoicism). His choice of them as targets probably reflects his\nreadiness to take over from Epicurus (most likely drawing on the\nlatter’s On nature books 14 and 15, but see Montarese 2012 for a different view) the critiques which the\nschool founder had felt it appropriate to launch in his own historical\ncontext. \n\n1.951–1117. The final part of book 1 is a leap from the\ninvisibly small to the unimaginably large. The universe is infinite,\nhe argues, consisting of infinitely extended space and an infinite\nnumber of atoms. Some philosophers, he adds, mistakenly picture our\nworld as formed around a spherical earth, itself located at the\nuniverse’s centre. Although Lucretius does not say so, the\njuxtaposition of these two themes was natural because the latter\nthesis—a version of the Platonic one that privileged our own\nworld as unique—was the main rival to that of the universe’s\ninfinity. Modern readers may therefore well sympathize with the\nmotivation of Lucretius’ critique of it, even if at the same time\nregretting his too ready dismissal of the ridiculous image of animals\nwalking upside down in the antipodes, where it is day when it is night\nhere (1.1058–67). \n\nBook 2 explains the nature of atomic compounds. \n\n2.80–332. The opening exposition of book 2 descends into the\ndetails of atoms’ behaviour and qualities. They are in perpetual\nmotion at enormous speed, since in the void they get no resistance\nfrom the medium, and when they collide they can only be deflected, not\nhalted. Their weight gives them an inherent tendency to move\ndownwards, but collisions can divert those motions in other\ndirections. The result is that, when in a cosmic arrangement, atoms\nbuild up complex and relatively stable patterns of motion, which at\nthe macroscopic level appear to us as states of rest or relatively\ngentle motion. Lucretius compares a flock of sheep on a distant\nhillside, which appears as a stationary white patch, even though close\nup the constituent sheep prove to be in motion (2.317–22). The most\ncelebrated part of this account, however, is at 2.216–93 (see extended textual discussion in Fowler 2002), where\nLucretius maintains that not only to explain how atomic collisions can\noccur in the first place, but also to account for the evident fact of\nfree will in the animal kingdom, it is necessary to postulate a\nminimal indeterminacy in the motions of atoms, an unpredictable\n‘swerve’ (clinamen) ‘at no fixed place or\ntime’. Otherwise we would all be automata, our motions\ndetermined by infinitely extended and unbreakable causal chains. A\nstriking resemblance to the indeterminacy postulated by modern quantum\nphysics—which has also often been invoked in debates about\ndeterminism—has helped make this passage the subject of\nparticularly intense debate.  Analogously to various modern\nphilosophical attempts to exploit quantum indeterminacy as a basis for\npsychological indeterminism, interpreters of Lucretius have long\ndebated what relation he postulates between the swerve and free\nwill. Some have read him as positing at least one atomic swerve in the\nsoul to coincide with (and probably help constitute) every new\nvolition. Others have drawn attention to his remark that the swerve is\nneeded ‘so that cause should not follow cause from\ninfinity’ (2.255) and argued that the theory aims merely to\nensure that our present self is not the necessary product of our\nentire past atomic history. A wide variety of further variants have been proposed. \n\n2.333–1022. After his account of atoms’ motion, Lucretius\nturns to their properties, explaining how a vast but finite variety of\natomic shapes underlies and accounts for the vast but finite phenomenal\nvariety that the world has to offer, without the atoms themselves\npossessing either sensible properties such as colours, or mental\npowers. \n\n2.1023–1174. The final part of the book returns,\nsymmetrically with the end of book 1, to the nature of the universe\nbeyond the confines of our own world. This time Lucretius’ theme is the\nexistence of other worlds besides our own, it being inconceivable, he\nargues, that in an infinite universe it should be only here that a\nworld has formed. Moreover, he adds, worlds come and go, our own\nincluded. Both themes—the numberless plurality of worlds and\ntheir transience—Lucretius regards as helpfully damaging to the\nreligious view of our world as a product of divine creation. \n\nBook 3 turns to the soul and its mortality. \n\n3.94–416. the soul’s constitution. The soul consists of two\nparts. The ‘spirit’ (anima) is spread throughout\nthe body, while the ‘mind’ (animus) is the command\ncentre, located in the chest. The soul in both aspects can be shown to\nbe corporeal, Lucretius argues. Its characteristic sensitivity and\nmobility are explicable by the special combination of atoms that\nconstitute it: it is a blend of the types of atoms constitutive of air,\nwind and fire, along with a fourth, ultra-fine type unique to soul.\nAlthough modern readers will find the details of this physiology\nhopelessly outdated, they can usefully replace Lucretian\n‘mind’ and ‘spirit’ with, respectively, the\nbrain and nervous system, in order to appreciate the enduring relevance\nof what follows, Lucretius’ argument that our conscious selves cannot\nsurvive death. \n\n3.417–829. Given that it is atomically constituted, the\nsoul must like every atomic compound be destined for eventual\ndissolution. Once the body dies, there is nothing to hold the soul\ntogether, and its atoms will disperse—as Lucretius argues with\na massive battery of proofs (around thirty, the exact number depending\non alternative ways of dividing up the text). For example, he argues,\nour mental development tracks that of the body through infancy,\nmaturity and senility alike, so it is only to be expected that the\nbody’s final disintegration should be accompanied by that of our mental\nfaculties. There is therefore, contrary to the most favoured religious\ntradition, no survival after death, no reincarnation, and no punishment\nin Hades. For the consequent lesson that death is not to be feared,\n see\n § 5\n below. \n\nBook 4 moves the focus to the soul’s powers. \n\n4.26–215. Lucretius starts by setting out the theory of\nsimulacra—atom-thin and lightning-fast\n‘images’ that stream from the surfaces of solid objects (or\nsometimes form spontaneously in mid air) and enter the eyes or mind to\ncause vision and visualization. \n\n4.216–1059. The basic theory is then applied to\nsense-perception, and above all to vision and visualization, including\ndreams. (The non-visual senses are addressed too, even though,\ntechnically speaking, they rely not on simulacra but either on direct contact with their object or on other\nkinds of effluence.) Lucretius devotes a substantial section to\ndescribing optical illusions, which his atomic theory claims to be able\nto account for without sacrificing its fundamental position that it is\nnever the senses that lie, only our interpretations of their data.\nIndeed, he defends this latter Epicurean paradox by deploying a\nclassic self-refutation argument against the sceptical alternative: to\ndeny that we have access to knowledge through the senses (its only\npossible entry route) is a philosophical stance that disqualifies its\nown adherents by depriving them of any possible grounds for its\nassertion (4.469–521). \n\nAlthough cognitive mechanisms provide the main focus, a variety of\nother animal functions, including nutrition and locomotion, are covered\nby this part of the book. Among the gems is a digression attacking the\nteleologists’ mode of physiological explanation (4.823–57). To explain\nbodily limbs and organs on the model of artefacts, as divinely created\nfor the sake of their use, is a misapplication of the craft-nature\nanalogy. Artefacts were invented for the better fulfilment of functions\nthat already existed in nature—cups to facilitate\ndrinking, beds to improve sleep, weapons for more effective fighting.\nNo analogous story can be told about e.g., the eye being created for\nseeing, because before there were eyes there was no such function as\nseeing. \n\nBooks 5 and 6 set out to explain the cosmos as a whole and its\nphenomenal contents. \n\n5.91–415 expands the earlier argument that our world is no\nmore than a transient amalgam of atoms. This finding is taken by\nLucretius to be damning to creationism, for benevolent creators would\nsurely (as Plato had maintained) have ensured that their product would be\neverlasting. Besides, he argues, the world is an environment too\nhostile to human beings to lend any credence to the creationist thesis\nthat it was made for them. While other creatures seem to have it easy,\nwe struggle all our lives to eke out a living. When the new-born human\nbaby takes its first look at the world and bursts into tears, one can\nadmire its prescience, considering all the troubles that lie ahead for\nit. \n\n5.416–770. Following up on this theme, Lucretius now\nreconstructs the blind process of atomic conglomeration that gave rise\nto our world. He then continues with a matchingly non-theistic series\nof explanations of individual celestial phenomena. In true Epicurean\nspirit (here and in book 6 too; see especially 6.703–11), his favoured\npolicy is to list a plurality of explanations of one and the same\nphenomenon without selecting one as correct. What matters is that,\nhowever many such explanations we acknowledge, they should be\nexclusively material explanations sufficient to render unnecessary the\npostulation of divine intervention. Being intrinsically possible, they\nmust also be true, if not in our world, then at any rate\nsomewhere, for in an infinite universe no possibility can\nremain unactualized (an application of the Principle of Plenitude).\nLucretius is here relying on an Epicurean modal theory based on \nactual—not just possible—worlds, whereby\n‘possible’ is equated with ‘true in one or more\n(actual) worlds’, ‘necessary’ with ‘true in all\n(actual) worlds’. \n\n5.771–1427. Continuing the early history of our world,\nLucretius envisages how life first emerged from the earth, and (an\nespecially admired and influential reconstruction) how humans developed\nfrom nomadic hunters to city-dwellers with language, law and the arts.\nIn this prehistory the exclusion of divine intervention, while rarely\nforegrounded, is plainly the underlying motivation. The fertile young\nearth naturally sprouted with life forms, and the organisms thus\ngenerated were innumerable random formations. Of these, most perished,\nbut a minority proved capable of surviving—thanks to strength,\ncunning, or utility to man—and of reproducing their kind. This\naccount, which has won admiration for its partial anticipation of\na Darwinian principle, the survival of the fittest, is plainly using a\nkind of natural selection to account non-teleologically for the\napparent presence of design in the animal kingdom. \n\nMuch the same anti-teleological program underlies the ensuing\nprehistory of civilization (5.925–1457). Each cultural advance was\nprompted by nature, and only subsequently taken up and developed by\nhuman beings. Hence, it is implied, no divine intervention need be\npostulated as an explanatory tool. No Prometheus was needed to\nintroduce fire, which rather was first brought to human attention by\nnaturally kindled forest fires (5.1091–1101). Language emerged\n(5.1028–90) because people started to notice how their instinctive\nvocal responses to things, comparable to animal noises, could be put at\nthe service of their intuitive desire to communicate (for which infants’\npre-linguistic pointing is cited as evidence). The same part of book 5\nis rich in other cultural reconstructions, including the origin of\nfriendship and justice in a primitive social contract (5.1011–27), and\nof conventional religion in early mankind’s misguided tendency to link\nvisions of the gods, above all in dreams, to their desire to explain\ncosmic phenomena (5.1161–1240). \n\n6.96–1286. To conclude his poem, Lucretius works through a\nrange of the phenomena that physical theorists were standardly called\nupon to account for: storms, waterspouts, earthquakes, plagues and the\nlike. Once more the exclusion of divine causation undoubtedly motivates\nthe account, the phenomena in question being nearly all ones popularly\nregarded as manifestations of divine intervention. Lucretius not only\nexplains them naturalistically, but is ready to mock the rival,\ntheological explanations: for example, if thunderbolts are weapons\nhurled by Zeus at human miscreants, why does he waste so much of his\nammunition on uninhabited regions, or, when he does score a hit,\nsometimes strike his own temple (6.387–422)? \n\nThe De rerum natura is, as its title confirms, a work of\nphysics, written in the venerable tradition of Greek treatises On\nnature. Nevertheless, Lucretius writes as a complete Epicurean,\noffering his reader not just cosmological understanding but the full\nrecipe for happiness. Certainly to eliminate fear of the divine through\nphysical understanding is one component of this task, but not the only\none. According to the Epicurean canon, the fear of death must also be\ncountered, and the rational management of pleasures and pains\nlearnt. \n\nSuch an agenda manifests itself at various strategically significant\npoints of the poem, in the form of Lucretius’ uplifting pleas for\nEpicurean values. The magnificent finale of book 3 (830–1094) is a\ndiatribe against the fear of death, taking as its starting point the\npreceding demonstration that death is simply annihilation. To fear a\nfuture state of death, Lucretius argues, is to make the conceptual\nblunder of supposing yourself present to regret and bewail your own\nnon-existence. The reality is that being dead will be no worse (just as\nit will be no better) than it was, long ago, not yet to have been born.\nThis Lucretian ‘symmetry argument’ (see Warren 2004; also\nDeath 2.3), which has enjoyed widespread discussion in\nthe recent philosophical literature on death, is found in company with\na whole battery of further arguments for acquiescing in the prospect of\none’s own dissolution. Book 4’s treatment of sexual passion (1037–1287) includes a\nmatching diatribe, comically denouncing the folly of enslaving oneself to any individual (1121–1191). \n\nThe proem to book 2 extols the Epicurean life of detached\ntranquility, portrayed as maintaining modest and easily satisfied\nappetites while shunning lofty ambitions and the disquiet these\ninevitably bring in their wake. And the proem to book 6, in praising\nthe city of Athens for the gifts of civilisation, adds that these are,\nnevertheless, dwarfed by that city’s greatest gift to mankind, Epicurus\nand his philosophy. For it is Epicurus alone who has made life\ngenuinely worth living, not only by releasing us from the torment of\nfear but also by teaching us how to manage our desires to the point\nwhere we can enjoy their genuine and lasting satisfaction. Lucretius’\nentire history of civilisation in book 5 (1011–1457) can be read as\nstrengthening this same motif (cf. Furley 1978): civilization has\nadvanced because of man’s desire to better his lot, but to no avail,\nbecause every advance eliminates one source of grief only to replace it\nwith another. The root cause of our troubles lies elsewhere, Lucretius\nis implying, and, even after civilization had reached its peak, it\nremained for Epicurus to bring that cause to light. \n\nThe Epicurean fourfold cure (tetrapharmakos) read:\n‘God holds no fears, death no worries. Good is easily attainable,\nevil easily endurable.’ The first three of these maxims are fully\nrepresented by the poem’s moral commentary, but the fourth is curiously\nabsent. How was evil to be endured? Epicurus’ recipe for\naccepting pain with equanimity lay in such strategies as concentrating\nthe mind on past pleasures, and, where the pain was terminally severe,\non its imminent eclipse by the painless state of death. Although this\nrecipe has not always impressed Epicurus’ modern interpreters, it was\nwidely and admiringly quoted by his ancient followers and sympathizers.\nIt is hard to believe that Lucretius, with his deep understanding of\nEpicurean ethics, did not plan to rectify its glaring omission from his\npoem. If he did so plan, the obvious place to incorporate the final maxim\nof the canon would have been in connection with the frightful\nsufferings in the great Athenian plague, horrifyingly described in the\npoem’s closing verses. Those who believe that the poem is unfinished,\nand that Lucretius had he lived would have developed or restructured\nits final part, may justifiably suspect that the possibility of good\ncheer and optimism in the face of pain was the motif that he was saving\nfor that role, wherever and however he might eventually have chosen to\nwork it in. \n\nLucretius presents Epicurus’ chief achievement as the defeat of\nreligio. Although this Latin word is correctly translated into\nEnglish as ‘religion’, its literal meaning is\n‘binding down’, and it therefore serves Lucretius as a\nterm, not for all attitudes of reverence towards the divine, but for\nthose which cow people’s spirits, rather than, as he thinks such\nattitudes should, elevate them to a joyful state of tranquility. \n\nEpicurus had insisted on the existence of the gods, but the mode of\nexistence he attributed to them has become a matter of controversy.\nThey have only ‘quasi-bodies’, for example, and are\nconstituted by nothing more than the wafer-thin and lightning-fast\n‘images’ (Latin simulacra, see above\n § 4)\n which according to Epicurus enter our eyes and\nminds to become the stuff of vision, imagination and dreams. Some\nscholars take this constitution out of simulacra to describe a\nhighly attenuated mode of biological being which somehow makes the\nimmortal gods an exception to the rule that compounds must eventually\ndisintegrate, so that they are able to live on forever, not in any\nworld like ours (since all worlds must themselves eventually perish)\nbut in the much safer regions between worlds. Others, who\ndoubt such a realist interpretation, take the reduction of gods to\nsimulacra to be Epicurus’ way of saying that these immortal\nbeings are our own intuitive thought-constructs, our personal\nidealizations of the ideally tranquil life to which we naturally\naspire, and that he is not committed to the further view that such\nbeings must actually exist as living organisms somewhere in the\nuniverse. Epicurus’ recorded instruction to think of god as a\nblessed and immortal being does not help us choose between the two\nreadings. It would probably be a mistake to assume that any text or\ntexts of Epicurus were available to resolve the ambiguity definitively,\nsimilar ambiguities being an endemic characteristic of much religious\ndiscourse (the most famous case in antiquity was Plato’s account of the\ncreation in his Timaeus, on whose interpretation his followers\nnever agreed despite possessing his entire works). Lucretius shows\nsigns of assuming the realist view of the gods (2.153–4, 6.76–7), yet\nhis account of the origin of religion (5.1169–82) leans more towards\nthe idealist reading. Disappointingly, the actual exposition of the\ngods’ nature that he promises us (5.155) never materializes. One may\nwonder whether he ever located in his massive Epicurean source the\nexplicit account of the gods’ mode of being that he was expecting to\nfind there. \n\nEither way, what is not in doubt is that the gods’ role as moral\nideals is paramount in the Epicurean system. And this is the function\nLucretius too gives them, especially in the proems to books 1, 3, 5 and\n6. The gods live a supremely tranquil life, never disquieted by either\nfavour or anger towards us. By contemplating them as they truly are we\ncan aspire to achieve that same blissful state within the confines of a\nhuman lifespan. But Lucretius adds another dimension to this theology:\nfor as the poem progresses Epicurus himself is increasingly presented\nas a god. In itself this apotheosis is probably consistent with\nEpicurean theology: Epicurus did after all attain the same morally\nparadigmatic status which characterizes the gods. But in the proem to\nbook 5 Epicurus is permitted to go beyond this paradigmatic role, and\nto become a heroic benefactor of mankind. Here Lucretius\nfollows a trend which had gathered pace after Epicurus’ own day, the\nrationalistic practice—associated with the name of \nEuhemerus—of explaining the gods as pioneering human benefactors whose\nservice had been institutionally acknowledged by formal divinization.\nWhat Lucretius effectively asserts is that, on a Euhemeristic ranking,\nEpicurus is a far greater god than Ceres or Bacchus, held to have\noriginally been the institutors of, respectively, agriculture and wine,\nand also a far greater god than the divinized Hercules. For Hercules\nrid the world merely of literal monsters like the Hydra, but it’s not\nas if there aren’t plenty of wild beasts left in the world to terrorize\nus today. Epicurus on the other hand has offered us real and permanent\nsalvation from monsters, namely those truly frightful monsters that\nhaunt our souls, such as insatiable desires, fears, and arrogance. \n\nAnother possibly Euhemerizing tendency, one that is an unsurprising\nfeature of Latin poetry and, if only for that reason, to be found in\nthe pages of Lucretius, is the use of gods’ names to designate items of\nspecial significance for human life, such as ‘Venus’ for\nlove or sex, and ‘Bacchus’ for wine. At 2.598–660 Lucretius\ndiscusses the religious portrayal of Earth as divine mother, and\nconcludes that if one is going to call sea\n‘Neptune’, corn ‘Ceres’, wine\n‘Bacchus’, etc.—as he himself indeed often enough\ndoes—one might reasonably also personify the earth as their\nmother, hence as ‘mother of the gods’. But, he adds in an\nimportant codicil, this usage is permissible only if one avoids the\npernicious religious beliefs that such locutions imply. \n\nThe proems are the most original poetic compositions in the\nDRN, and one may suspect that the book 5 proem’s brand of\nEuhemerizing theology goes beyond traditional Epicureanism. The same\nsuspicion recurs with even greater force when we focus on the proem to\nbook 1. In it Lucretius prays to Venus, not only as the universal life\nforce but also as ancestress of the Romans, begging her to intervene\nwith her lover Mars and save the troubled Roman republic from civil\nstrife. Although this choice of motif may owe much to Lucretius’\nforerunner and model Empedocles, for whom Love or Aphrodite is the\ngreat creative force in the cosmos, it borders perilously on a betrayal\nof the poem’s central motif, that we should not fear the gods because\nthey do not, and never would, intervene in our world. Readers, as they\nprogress further into the poem, are no doubt expected to accumulate the\nappropriate materials for understanding the proem as in tune with the\ntrue Epicurean message, but there is little agreement as to how this is\nmeant to be achieved. One possibility is as follows. The warlike Mars\nis not, as such, a true Epicurean god, but a popular perversion of the\ntrue divine nature, resulting from people’s projection of their own\nangry and competitive temperament onto this ideal being. If so, the\nprayer for Venus to pacify Mars is no more than the expressed hope that\nRomans will return to appreciating the true peaceful nature of\ndivinity, which for an Epicurean like Lucretius is nothing different\nfrom their themselves striving to emulate this paradigm of\npeacefulness. The poem’s lesson will itself, if successfully taught to\nits Roman audience, be enough to answer its author’s opening\nprayer. \n\nLucretius was both admired and imitated by writers of the early\nRoman empire, while in the eyes of Latin patristic authors like\nLactantius he came to serve as the leading spokesman of the godless Epicurean\nphilosophy. His poem subsequently survived in two outstanding\n9th-century manuscripts (known as O and Q), which following the poem’s\nrediscovery by the papal secretary Poggio Bracciolini in 1417 (for this fascinating story see Greenblatt 2011) became the basis of the\nRenaissance editions. It was through Lucretius, along with the Latin\ntranslation of Diogenes Laertius’ Life of Epicurus, that Epicurean\nideas entered the main philosophical (especially ethical) debates of\nthe age. However, despite his extensive impact in literary and\nphilosophical circles—he is, for example, among the writers\nmost assiduously cited by Montaigne—Lucretius struggled for two\ncenturies to shake off the pejorative label of ‘atheist’.\nHe became a key influence on the emergence of early modern atomism in\nthe 17th century—a development above all due to\nPierre Gassendi’s construction of an atomistic system which, while\nfounded on Epicurus and Lucretius, had been so modified as to be\nacceptable to Christian ideology. Lucretius’ many admirers in the early modern era included Thomas Jefferson, a self-declared Epicurean who owned numerous editions of the poem.","contact.mail":"dns1@cam.ac.uk","contact.domain":"cam.ac.uk"}]
