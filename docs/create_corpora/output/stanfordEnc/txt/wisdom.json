Philosophers, psychologists, spiritual leaders,\npoets, novelists, life coaches, and a variety of other important\nthinkers have tried to understand the concept of wisdom.  This entry\nwill provide a brief and general overview, and analysis of, several\nphilosophical views on the topic of wisdom.  It is not intended to\ncapture the many interesting and important approaches to wisdom found\nin other fields of inquiry. Moreover, this entry will focus on several\nmajor ideas in the Western philosophical tradition.  In particular, it\nwill focus on five general approaches to understanding what it takes\nto be wise: (1) wisdom as epistemic humility, (2) wisdom as epistemic\naccuracy, (3) wisdom as knowledge, (4) a hybrid theory of wisdom, and\n(5) wisdom as rationality.\n\n\n \nSocrates' view of wisdom, as expressed by Plato in The\nApology (20e-23c), is sometimes interpreted as an example of a\nhumility theory of wisdom (see, for example, Ryan 1996 and Whitcomb,\n2010).  In Plato's\nApology, Socrates and his friend Chaerephon visit the oracle\nat Delphi.  As the story goes, Chaerephon asks the oracle whether\nanyone is wiser than Socrates. The oracle's answer is that Socrates is\nthe wisest person. Socrates reports that he is puzzled by this answer\nsince so many other people in the community are well known for their\nextensive knowledge and wisdom, and yet Socrates claims that he lacks\nknowledge and wisdom. Socrates does an investigation to get to the\nbottom of this puzzle. He interrogates a series of politicians, poets,\nand craftsmen. As one would expect, Socrates' investigation reveals\nthat those who claim to have knowledge either do not really know any\nof the things they claim to know, or else know far less than they\nproclaim to know. The most knowledgeable of the bunch, the craftsmen,\nknow about their craft, but they claim to know things far beyond the\nscope of their expertise.  Socrates, so we are told, neither suffers\nthe vice of claiming to know things he does not know, nor the vice of\nclaiming to have wisdom when he does not have wisdom. In this\nrevelation, we have a potential resolution to the wisdom puzzle\nin The Apology.  \n \nAlthough the story may initially appear to deliver a clear theory of\nwisdom, it is actually quite difficult to capture a textually accurate\nand plausible theory here.  One interpretation is that Socrates is\nwise because he, unlike the others, believes he is not wise, whereas\nthe poets, politicians, and craftsmen arrogantly and falsely believe\nthey are wise. This theory, which will be labeled Humility Theory 1\n(H1), is simply (see, for example, Lehrer & Smith 1996, 3): \n \nThis is a tempting and popular interpretation because Socrates\ncertainly thinks he has shown that the epistemically arrogant poets,\npoliticians, and craftsmen lack wisdom. Moreover, Socrates claims that\nhe is not wise, and yet, if we trust the oracle, Socrates is actually\nwise.  \n \nUpon careful inspection, (H1) is not a reasonable interpretation of\nSocrates' view. Although Socrates does not\nboast of his own wisdom, he does believe the oracle. If he\nwas convinced that he was not wise, he would have rejected the oracle\nand gone about his business because he\nwould not find any puzzle to unravel.  Clearly, he believes, on\nsome level, that he is wise. The mystery is: what is wisdom if he has\nit and the others lack it?   Socrates nowhere suggests that\nhe has become unwise after believing the oracle. Thus, (H1) is not an\nacceptable interpretation of Socrates' view. \n \nMoreover, (H1) is false. Many people are clear counterexamples to\n(H1). Many people who believe they are not wise are correct in their\nself-assessment. Thus, the belief that one is not wise is not a\nsufficient condition for wisdom. Furthermore, it seems that the belief\nthat one is not wise is not necessary for wisdom. It seems plausible\nto think that a wise person could be wise enough to realize that she\nis wise. Too much modesty might get in the way of making good\ndecisions and sharing what one knows.  If one thinks Socrates was a\nwise person, and if one accepts that Socrates did, in fact, accept\nthat he was wise, then Socrates himself is a counterexample to\n(H1). The belief that one is wise could be a perfectly well justified\nbelief for a wise person. Having the belief that one is wise does not,\nin itself, eliminate the possibility that the person is wise. Nor does\nit guarantee the vice of arrogance. We should hope that a wise person\nwould have a healthy dose of epistemic self-confidence, appreciate\nthat she is wise, and share her understanding of reality with the rest\nof us who could benefit from her wisdom. Thus, the belief that\none is not wise is not required for wisdom. \n \n(H1) focused on believing one is not wise. Another version of the\nhumility theory is worth considering.  When Socrates demonstrates that\na person is not wise, he does so by showing that the person lacks some\nknowledge that he or she claims to possess.  Thus, one might think\nthat Socrates' view could be better captured by focusing on the idea\nthat wise people believe they lack knowledge (rather than lacking\nwisdom). That is, one might consider the following view: \n\nUnfortunately, this interpretation is not any better than (H1). It\nfalls prey to problems similar to those that refuted (H1) both as an\ninterpretation of Socrates, and as an acceptable account of\nwisdom. Moreover, remember that Socrates admits that the craftsmen do\nhave some knowledge. Socrates might have considered them to be wise if\nthey had restricted their confidence and claims to knowledge to what\nthey actually did know about their craft. Their problem was that they\nprofessed to have knowledge beyond their area of expertise. The\nproblem was not that they claimed to have knowledge.  \n\nBefore turning to alternative approaches to wisdom, it is worth\nmentioning another interpretation of Socrates that fits with the\ngeneral spirit of epistemic humility.  One might think that what\nSocrates is establishing is that his wisdom is found in his\nrealization that human wisdom is not a particularly valuable kind of\nwisdom.  Only the gods possess the kind of wisdom that is truly\nvaluable. This is clearly one of Socrates' insights, but it does not\nprovide us with an understanding of the nature of wisdom. It tells us\nonly of its comparative value.  Merely understanding this evaluative\ninsight would not, for reasons similar to those discussed with (HP1)\nand (HP2), make one wise. \nHumility theories of wisdom are not promising, but they do, perhaps,\nprovide us with some important character traits associated with wise\npeople. Wise people, one might argue, possess epistemic\nself-confidence, yet lack epistemic arrogance. Wise people tend to\nacknowledge their fallibility, and wise people are reflective,\nintrospective, and tolerant of uncertainty.  Any acceptable theory of\nwisdom ought to be compatible with such traits.  However, those traits\nare not, in and of themselves, definitive of wisdom.  \n \nSocrates can be interpreted as providing an epistemic accuracy, rather\nthan an epistemic humility, theory of wisdom. The poets, politicians,\nand craftsmen all believe they have knowledge about topics on which\nthey are considerably ignorant. Socrates, one might argue, believes he\nhas knowledge when, and only when, he really does have knowledge.\nPerhaps wise people restrict their confidence to propositions for\nwhich they have knowledge or, at least, to propositions for which they\nhave excellent justification.  Perhaps Socrates is better interpreted\nas having held an Epistemic Accuracy Theory such as: \n\nAccording to (EA1), a wise person is accurate about what she knows and\nwhat she does not know. If she really knows p, she believes she knows\np. And, if she believes she knows p, then she really does know\np. (EA1) is consistent with the idea that Socrates accepts that he is\nwise and with the idea that Socrates does have some knowledge. (EA1)\nis a plausible interpretation of the view Socrates endorses, but it is\nnot a plausible answer in the search for an understanding of\nwisdom. Wise people can make mistakes about what they know. Socrates,\nMaimonides, King Solomon, Einstein, Goethe, Gandhi, and every other\ncandidate for the honor of wisdom have held false beliefs about what\nthey did and did not know. It is easy to imagine a wise person being\njustified in believing she possesses knowledge about some claim, and\nalso easy to imagine that she could be shown to be mistaken, perhaps\nlong after her death. If (EA1) is true, then just because a person\nbelieves she has knowledge when she does not, she is not wise. That\nseems wrong.  It is hard to imagine that anyone at all is, or ever has\nbeen, wise if (EA1) is correct.  \n \nWe could revise the Epistemic Accuracy Theory to get around this\nproblem. We might only require that a wise person's belief is\nhighly justified when she believes she has knowledge. \nThat excuses people with bad epistemic luck. \n\n(EA2) gets around the problem with (EA1). The Socratic Method\nchallenges one to produce reasons for one's view. When\nSocrates' interlocutor is left dumbfounded, or reduced to\nabsurdity, Socrates rests his case. One might argue that through\nhis questioning, Socrates reveals not that his opponents\nlack knowledge because their beliefs are false, but he\ndemonstrates that his opponents are not justified in holding the\nviews they profess to know. Since the craftsmen, poets, and\npoliticians questioned by Socrates all fail his interrogation,\nthey were shown, one might argue, to have claimed to have knowledge\nwhen their beliefs were not even justified.  \n \nMany philosophers would hesitate to endorse this interpretation of\nwhat is going on in The Apology.  They would argue that a\nfailure to defend one's beliefs from Socrates' relentless questioning\ndoes not show that a person is not justified in believing a\nproposition. Many philosophers would argue that having very good\nevidence, or forming a belief via a reliable process, would be\nsufficient for justification. \nProving, or demonstrating to an interrogator, that one is justified is\nanother matter, and not necessary for simply being\njustified. Socrates, some might argue, shows only that the craftsmen,\npoets, and politicians cannot defend themselves from his questions. He\ndoes not show, one might argue, that the poets, politicians, and\ncraftsmen have unjustified beliefs.  Since we gain very little insight\ninto the details of the conversation in this dialogue, it would be\nunfair to dismiss this interpretation on these grounds. Perhaps\nSocrates did show, through his intense questioning, that the\ncraftsmen, poets, and politicians formed and held their beliefs\nwithout adequate evidence or formed and held them through unreliable\nbelief forming processes.  Socrates only reports that they did not\nknow all that they professed to know.  Since we do not get to witness\nthe actual questioning as we do in Plato's other dialogues, we should\nnot reject (EA2) as an interpretation of Socrates' view of wisdom\nin The Apology.  \n \nRegardless of whether (EA2) is Socrates' view, there are problems for\n(EA2) as an account of what it means to be wise. Even if (EA2) is\nexactly what Socrates meant, some philosophers would argue that one\ncould be justified in believing a proposition, but not realize that\nshe is justified. If that is a possible situation for a wise person to\nbe in, then she might be justified, but fail to believe she has\nknowledge. Could a wise person be in such a situation, or is it\nnecessary that a wise person would always recognize the epistemic\nvalue of what he or she \n  believes?[1]\n  If this situation is impossible,\nthen this criticism could be avoided. There is no need to resolve this\nissue here because (EA1) and (EA2) fall prey to another, much less\nphilosophically thorny and controversial problem. \n \n(EA1) and (EA2) suffer from a similar, and very serious,\nproblem.  Imagine a person who has very little knowledge. Suppose\nfurther, that the few things she does know are of little or no importance. She\ncould be the sort of person that nobody would ever go to for\ninformation or advice. Such a person could be very cautious and believe that\nshe knows only what she actually knows. Although she would have\naccurate beliefs about what she does and does not know, she would not\nbe wise. This shows that (EA1) is flawed. As for (EA2), imagine that\nshe believes she knows only what she is actually justified in\nbelieving. She is still not wise. It should be noted, however, that\nalthough accuracy theories do not provide an adequate account of\nwisdom, they reveal an important insight. Perhaps a necessary\ncondition for being wise is that wise people think they have knowledge\nonly when their beliefs are highly justified. Or, even more simply,\nperhaps wise people have epistemically justified, or rational, beliefs.  \n\nAn alternative approach to wisdom focuses on the more positive idea\nthat wise people are very knowledgeable people. There are many views\nin the historical and contemporary philosophical literature on wisdom\nthat have knowledge, as opposed to humility or accuracy, as at least a\nnecessary condition of wisdom.  Aristotle (Nichomachean\nEthics VI, ch. 7), Descartes (Principles of Philosophy),\nRichard Garrett (1996), John Kekes (1983), Keith Lehrer & Nicholas\nSmith (1996), Robert Nozick (1989), Plato (The Republic),\nSharon Ryan (1996, 1999), Valerie Tiberius (2008), Dennis Whitcomb\n(2010) and Linda Zagzebski (1996) for example, have all defended\ntheories of wisdom that require a wise person to have knowledge of\nsome sort.  All of these views very clearly distinguish knowledge from\nexpertise on a particular subject.  Moreover, all of these views\nmaintain that wise people know “what is important.” The\nviews differ, for the most part, over what it is important for a wise\nperson to know, and on whether there is any behavior, action, or way\nof living, that is required for wisdom.  \n\nAristotle distinguished between two different kinds of wisdom,\ntheoretical wisdom and practical wisdom. Theoretical wisdom is,\naccording to Aristotle, “scientific knowledge, combined with\nintuitive reason, of the things that are highest by nature”\n(Nicomachean Ethics, VI, 1141b).  For Aristotle, theoretical\nwisdom involves knowledge of necessary, scientific, first principles\nand propositions that can be logically deduced from them.  Aristotle's\nidea that scientific knowledge is knowledge of necessary truths and\ntheir logical consequences is no longer a widely accepted view. Thus,\nfor the purposes of this discussion, I will consider a theory that\nreflects the spirit of Aristotle's view on theoretical wisdom, but\nwithout the controversy about the necessary or contingent nature of\nscientific knowledge. Moreover, it will combine scientific knowledge\nwith other kinds of factual knowledge, including knowledge about\nhistory, philosophy, music, literature, mathematics, etc. Consider the\nfollowing, knowledge based, theory of wisdom: \n\nAccording to (WFK), a wise person is a person who knows a lot about\nthe universe and our place in it. She would have extensive knowledge\nabout the standard academic subjects. There are many positive things\nto say about (WFK). (WFK) nicely distinguishes between narrow\nexpertise and knowledge of the mundane, from the important, broad, and\ngeneral kind of knowledge possessed by wise people. As Aristotle puts\nit, “…we think that some people are wise in general, not\nin some particular field or in any other limited\nrespect…” (Nicomachean Ethics, Book 6,\n1141a).  \n\nThe main problem for (WFK) is that some of the most knowledgeable\npeople are not wise. Although they have an abundance of very important\nfactual knowledge, they lack the kind of practical know-how that is a\nmark of a wise person. Wise people know how to get on in the world in\nall kinds of situations and with all kinds of people. Extensive\nfactual knowledge is not enough to give us what a wise person\nknows. As Robert Nozick points out, “Wisdom is not just knowing\nfundamental truths, if these are unconnected with the guidance of life\nor with a perspective on its meaning” (1989, 269).  There is more to\nwisdom than intelligence and knowledge of science and philosophy or\nany other subject matter. Aristotle is well aware of the limitations\nof what he calls theoretical wisdom.    However, rather\nthan making improvements to something like (WFK), Aristotle\ndistinguishes it as one kind of wisdom. Other philosophers would be\nwilling to abandon (WFK), that is, claim that it provides insufficient\nconditions for wisdom, and add on what is missing. \n\nAristotle has a concept of practical wisdom that makes up for what is\nmissing in theoretical wisdom. In Book VI of the Nicomachean\nEthics, he claims, “This is why we say Anaxagoras, Thales,\nand men like them have philosophic but not practical wisdom, when we\nsee them ignorant of what is to their own advantage, and why we say\nthat they know things that are remarkable, admirable, difficult, and\ndivine, but useless; viz. because it is not human goods they\nseek” (1141a).  Knowledge of contingent facts that are useful to\nliving well is required in Aristotle's practical wisdom. According to\nAristotle, “Now it is thought to be the mark of a man of\npractical wisdom to be able to deliberate well about what is good and\nexpedient for himself, not in some particular respect, e.g. about what\nsorts of thing conduce to health or to strength, but about what sorts\nof thing conduce to the good life in general” (Nichomachean\nEthics, VI, 1140a–1140b).  Thus, for Aristotle, practical\nwisdom requires knowing, in general, how to live well. Many\nphilosophers agree with Aristotle on this point. However, many would\nnot be satisfied with the conclusion that theoretical wisdom is one\nkind of wisdom and practical wisdom another. Other philosophers,\nincluding Linda Zagzebski (1996), agree that there are these two types\nof wisdom that ought to be distinguished. \nLet's proceed, without argument, on the assumption that it is possible\nto have a theory of one, general, kind of wisdom.  Wisdom, in general,\nmany philosophers would argue, requires practical knowledge about\nliving. What Aristotle calls theoretical wisdom, many would contend,\nis not wisdom at all.  Aristotle's theoretical wisdom is merely\nextensive knowledge or deep understanding.  Nicholas Maxwell (1984),\nin his argument to revolutionize education, argues that we should be\nteaching for wisdom, which he sharply distinguishes from standard\nacademic knowledge. Similar points are raised by Robert Sternberg\n(2001) and Andrew Norman (1996).  Robert Nozick holds a view very\nsimilar to Aristotle's theory of practical wisdom, but Nozick is\ntrying to capture the essence of wisdom, period. He is not trying to\ndefine one, alternative, kind of wisdom. Nozick claims, “Wisdom\nis what you need to understand in order to live well and cope with the\ncentral problems and avoid the dangers in the predicaments human\nbeings find themselves in” (1989, 267).  And, John Kekes\nmaintains that, “What a wise man knows, therefore, is how to\nconstruct a pattern that, given the human situation, is likely to lead\nto a good life” (1983, 280).  More recently, Valerie Tiberius (2008)\nhas developed a practical view that connects wisdom with well being,\nrequiring, among other things, that a wise person live the sort of\nlife that he or she could sincerely endorse upon reflection.  Such\npractical views of wisdom could be expressed, generally, as\nfollows. \n\nThis view captures Aristotle's basic idea of practical wisdom. It also\ncaptures an important aspect of views defended by Nozick, Plato,\nGarrett, Kekes, Maxwell, Ryan, and Tiberius. Although giving an\naccount of what it means to know how to live well may prove as\ndifficult a topic as providing an account of wisdom, Nozick provides a\nvery illuminating start. \n\nWith Nozick's explanation of what one must know in order to live well,\nwe have an interesting and quite attractive, albeit somewhat rough,\ntheory of wisdom. As noted above, many philosophers, including\nAristotle and Zagzebski would, however, reject (KLW) as the full story\non wisdom.  Aristotle and Zagzebski would obviously reject (KLW) as\nthe full story because they believe theoretical wisdom is another kind\nof wisdom, and are unwilling to accept that there is a conception of\none, general, kind of wisdom. Kekes claims, “The possession of\nwisdom shows itself in reliable, sound, reasonable, in a word, good\njudgment. In good judgment, a person brings his knowledge to bear on\nhis actions. To understand wisdom, we have to understand its\nconnection with knowledge, action, and judgment” (1983, 277).  Kekes\nadds, “Wisdom ought also to show in the man who has it”\n(1983, 281).  Many philosophers, therefore, think that wisdom is not\nrestricted even to knowledge about how to live well. Tiberius thinks\nthe wise person's actions reflect their basic values.  These\nphilosophers believe that being wise also includes action. A person\ncould satisfy the conditions of any of the principles we have\nconsidered thus far and nevertheless behave in a wildly reckless\nmanner. Wildly reckless people are, even if very knowledgeable about\nlife, not wise. \nPhilosophers who are attracted to the idea that knowing how to live\nwell is a necessary condition for wisdom might want to simply tack on\na success condition to (KLW) to get around cases in which a person\nknows all about living well, yet fails to put this knowledge into\npractice. Something along the lines of the following theory would\ncapture this idea. \n\nThe idea of the success condition is that one puts one's knowledge\ninto practice.  Or, rather than using the terminology of success, one\nmight require that a wise person's beliefs and values cohere with\none's actions (Tiberius, 2008).  The main idea is that one's actions\nare reflective of one's understanding of what it means to live well.\nA view along the lines of (KLS) would be embraced by Aristotle and\nZagzebski (for practical wisdom), and by Kekes, Nozick, and\nTiberius. (KLS) would not be universally embraced, however (see Ryan\n1999, for further criticisms).  One criticism of (KLS) is that one\nmight think that all the factual knowledge required by (WFK) is\nmissing from this theory. One might argue that (WFK), the view that a\nwise person has extensive factual knowledge, was rejected only because\nit did not provide sufficient conditions for wisdom. Many philosophers\nwould claim that (WFK) does provide a necessary condition for\nwisdom. A wise person, such a critic would argue, needs to know how to\nlive well (as described by Nozick), but she also needs to have some\ndeep and far-reaching theoretical, or factual, knowledge that may have\nvery little impact on her daily life, practical decisions, or\nwell being. In the preface of his Principles of Philosophy,\nDescartes insisted upon factual knowledge as an important component of\nwisdom. Descartes wrote, “It is really only God alone who has\nPerfect Wisdom, that is to say, who has a complete knowledge of the\ntruth of all things; but it may be said that men have more wisdom or\nless according as they have more or less knowledge of the most\nimportant truths” (Principles, 204).  Of course, among\nthose important truths, one might claim, are truths about living well,\nas well as knowledge in the basic academic subject areas. \n\nMoreover, one might complain that the insight left standing from\nEpistemic Accuracy theories is also missing from (KLS). One might\nthink that a wise person not only knows a lot, and succeeds at living\nwell, she also confines her claims to knowledge (or belief that she\nhas knowledge) to those propositions that she is justified in\nbelieving.  \nOne way to try to accommodate the various insights from the theories\nconsidered thus far is in the form of a hybrid theory. One such idea\nis: \n\nAlthough this Hybrid Theory has a lot going for it, there are a number\nof important criticisms to consider.  Dennis Whitcomb (2010) objects\nto all theories of wisdom that include a living well condition, or an\nappreciation of living well condition. He gives several interesting\nobjections against such views. Whitcomb thinks that a person who is\ndeeply depressed and totally devoid of any ambition for living well\ncould nevertheless be wise.  As long as such a person is deeply\nknowledgeable about academic subjects and knows how to live well, that\nperson would have all they need for wisdom.  With respect to a very\nknowledgeable and deeply depressed person with no ambition but to stay\nin his room, he claims, “If I ran across such a person, I would\ntake his advice to heart, wish him a return to health, and leave the\ncontinuing search for sages to his less grateful advisees.  And I\nwould think he was wise despite his depression-induced failure to\nvalue or desire the good life.  So I think that wisdom does not\nrequire valuing or desiring the good life.”  \nIn response to Whitcomb's penetrating criticism, one could argue that\na deeply depressed person who is wise, would still live as well as she\ncan, and would still value living well, even if she falls far short of\nperfection.  Such a person would attempt to get help to deal with her\ndepression.  If she really does not care at all, she may be very\nknowledgeable, but she is not wise.  There is something irrational\nabout knowing how to live well and refusing to try to do so.  Such\nirrationality is not compatible with wisdom.  A person with this\ninternal conflict may be extremely clever and shrewd, one to listen to\non many issues, one to trust on many issues, and may even win a Nobel\nPrize for her intellectual greatness, but she is not admirable enough,\nand rationally consistent enough, to be wise.  Wisdom is a virtue and\na way of living, and it requires more than smart ideas and\nknowledge. \n\nAristotle held that “it is evident that it is impossible to be\npractically wise without being good” (Nicomachean\nEthics, 1144a, 36–37). Most of the philosophers mentioned\nthus far would include moral virtue in their understanding of what it\nmeans to live well.  However, Whitcomb challenges any theory of wisdom\nthat requires moral virtue. Whitcomb contends that a deeply evil\nperson could nevertheless be wise. \n\nAgain, it is important to contrast being wise from being clever and\nintelligent.  If we think of wisdom as the highest, or among the\nhighest, of human virtues, then it seems incompatible with a deeply\nevil personality.  \n \nThere is, however, a very serious problem with the Hybrid Theory.\nSince so much of what was long ago considered knowledge has been\nabandoned, or has evolved, a theory that requires truth (through a\nknowledge condition) would exclude almost all people who are now long\ndead, including Hypatia, Socrates, Confucius, Aristotle, Homer, Lao\nTzu, etc. from the list of the wise.  Bad epistemic luck, and having\nlived in the past, should not count against being wise.  But, since\ntruth is a necessary condition for knowledge, bad epistemic luck is\nsufficient to undermine a claim to knowledge.  What matters, as far as\nbeing wise goes, is not that a wise person has knowledge, but that she\nhas highly justified and rational beliefs about a wide variety of\nsubjects, including how to live well, science, philosophy,\nmathematics, history, geography, art, literature, psychology, and so\non.  And the wider the variety of interesting topics, the better.\nAnother way of developing this same point is to imagine a person with\nhighly justified beliefs about a wide variety of subjects, but who is\nunaware that she is trapped in the Matrix, or some other skeptical\nscenario.  Such a person could be wise even if she is sorely lacking\nknowledge.  A theory of wisdom that focuses on having rational or\nepistemically justified beliefs, rather than the higher standard of\nactually having knowledge, would be more promising. Moreover, such a\ntheory would incorporate much of what is attractive about epistemic\nhumility, and epistemic accuracy, theories. \n\nThe final theory to be considered here is an attempt to capture all\nthat is good, while avoiding all the serious problems of the other\ntheories discussed thus far.  Perhaps wisdom is a deep and\ncomprehensive kind of rationality (Ryan, 2012). In condition (1), DRT takes account of what is attractive about\nsome knowledge theories by requiring epistemically justified beliefs\nabout a wide variety of standard academic subjects.  Condition (2)\ntakes account of what is attractive about theories that require\nknowledge about how to live well. For example, having justified\nbeliefs about how to live in a practically rational way would include\nhaving a well-reasoned strategy for dealing with the practical aspects\nof life.  Having a rational plan does not require perfect success.  It\nrequires having good reasons behind one's actions, responding\nappropriately to, and learning from, one's mistakes, and having a\nrational plan for all sorts of situations and problems.  Having\njustified beliefs about how to live in a morally rational way would\nnot involve being a moral saint, but would require that one has good\nreasons supporting her beliefs about what is morally right and\nwrong, and about what one morally ought and ought not do in a wide\nvariety of circumstances.  Having justified beliefs about living in an\nemotionally rational way would involve, not dispassion, but having\njustified beliefs about what is, and what is not, an emotionally\nrational response to a situation.  For example, it is appropriate to\nfeel deeply sad when dealing with the loss of a loved one.  But,\nordinarily, feeling deeply sad or extremely angry is not an\nappropriate emotion to spilled milk.  A wise person would have\nrational beliefs about the emotional needs and behaviors of other\npeople. Condition (3) ensures that the wise person live a life that\nreflects what she or he is justified in believing is a rational way to\nlive. In condition (4), DRT respects epistemic humility.  Condition\n(4) requires that a wise person not believe things without epistemic\njustification.  The Deep Rationality Theory rules out all of the\nunwise poets, politicians, and craftsmen that were ruled out by\nSocrates.  Wise people do not think they know when they lack\nsufficient evidence.  Moreover, wise people are not epistemically\narrogant. \nThe Deep Rationality Theory does not require knowledge or perfection.\nBut it does require rationality, and it accommodates degrees of\nwisdom.  It is a promising theory of wisdom.","contact.mail":"sharon.ryan@mail.wvu.edu","contact.domain":"mail.wvu.edu"}]
