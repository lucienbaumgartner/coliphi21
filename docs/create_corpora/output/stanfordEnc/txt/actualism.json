Now, even though there are no Aliens, it seems intuitively the\ncase that there could have been such things. After all, life\nmight have evolved very differently than the way it did in fact. For\nexample, if the fundamental physical constants or the laws of evolution\nhad been slightly different, very different kinds of things might have\nexisted. So in virtue of what is it true that there could have been Aliens\nwhen in fact there are none, and when, moreover, nothing that exists in\nfact could have been an Alien?\n\n\n\nTo answer this question, a philosopher should try to identify the special\nfeatures of the world that are responsible for the truth of claims about\nwhat could have been the case. One group of philosophers,\nthe possibilists, offers the following answer: ‘It is\npossible that there are Aliens’ is true because there are in fact\nindividuals that could have been Aliens. At first blush, this might appear\ndirectly to contradict the premise that no existing thing could possibly\nhave been an Alien. The possibilist's thesis, however, is that existence,\nor actuality, encompasses only a subset of the things that, in\nthe broadest sense, are. Rather, in addition to things like us\nthat actually exist, there are merely possible things —\npossible Aliens, for example — that could have existed,\nbut, as it happens, do not. So there\nare such things, but they just happen to exhibit a rather\nless robust but nonetheless fully-fledged type of being than we\ndo. For the possibilist, then, ‘It is possible that there are\nAliens’ is true simply in virtue of the fact that there are\npossible-but-nonactual Aliens, i.e., things that could have existed\n(but do not) and that would have been Aliens if they had.\n\n\n\nActualists reject this answer; they deny that there are any nonactual\nindividuals. Actualism is the philosophical position that everything there\nis — everything that can in any sense be said to be\n— exists, or is actual. Put another way, actualism\ndenies that there is any kind of being beyond actual existence; to be is\nto exist, and to exist is to be actual. Actualism therefore stands in\nstark contrast to possibilism, which, as we've seen, takes the things\nthere are to include possible but non-actual objects.\n\n\n\nOf course, actualists will agree that there could have been Aliens.  An\nactualist theory, therefore, will be a metaphysical theory that\nattempts to account for the truth of claims like ‘It is possible\nthat there are Aliens’ without appealing to any nonactual objects\nwhatsoever. What makes actualism so philosophically interesting, is that\nthere is no obviously correct way to account for the truth of claims like\n‘It is possible that there are Aliens’ without appealing to\npossible but nonactual objects. In this article, we will clarify the\n“possibilist challenge” to actualism in some detail and lay\nout the various attempts to meet the challenge and assess their\neffectiveness.\n\n\n\nThe fundamental thesis of actualism\n is: \n  \nOr, equivalently: \n\nPossibilism denies thesis A.  More specifically, according\nto the possibilist, there are things that do not, in fact, exist but which\ncould have existed — things like possible Aliens (in the\nsense above), possible people that were never born, and so on.  Note that\nthis is not merely to say that there could have been Aliens, or that there\ncould have been people other than those who actually exist.  Nearly\neveryone believes that.  Rather, it is to say that there really\nare, quite literally, things that do not actually exist but which\ncould have.  (An important but significantly different notion of\npossibilism to which many of the issues in this article do not apply was\ndeveloped by the philosopher David Lewis, and is discussed in the\nsupplemental document\n Classical Possibilism and Lewisian Possibilism.) \n\nAs will be discussed in detail below, possibilism provides an elegantly\nsimple, general account of the truth conditions of our modal\ndiscourse. The possibilist challenge to actualism is to give an\nanalysis of our ordinary modal beliefs that is consistent with thesis A\nand, hence, which doesn't appeal to possible but nonactual objects.  There\nare two central aspects to the possibilist challenge: the challenge of\npossible worlds, and the challenge of possible objects.  The latter will\nbe the central focus of this article, but, for the sake of completeness,\nwe begin with a brief discussion of the former. \n\nClaims such as ‘It is possible that there are Aliens’ and\n‘It is necessary that human beings are mortal’ are known\nas modal claims, because the sentential prefixes ‘it is\npossible that’ and ‘it is necessary that’ indicate a\n‘mode’ in which the statements they precede are true. Modal\nclaims of these (and many other) forms are ubiquitous in our thought and\ndiscourse. Many of our reflective and creative thoughts seem to be about\npossibilities (consider, for example, the possibility that there are\nclean, fuel-efficient automobiles that cause no harm to the environment)\nand much of our logical reasoning involves drawing conclusions which, in\nsome sense, necessarily follow from premises that we already\nbelieve. Modal logic is the logic of possibility and necessity and the\nstudy of modal logic, as a discipline, has flourished in the latter half\nof the twentieth century. This was due in no small part to the\nintroduction of the concept of possible worlds to investigate the\ntruth conditions of modal claims. A large part of the logic of possibility\nand necessity seems to be captured by treating the modal operators\n‘it is necessary that’ and ‘it is possible that’\nas quantifiers over possible worlds. That is, the following semantic\nanalyses seem to capture a large part of the logic of modality: \n\nNotice that it is a consequence of analysis (b) that true claims\nasserting a possibility imply the existence of possible worlds. \n\nOn the face of it, then, the possible worlds analysis of the truth\nconditions of basic modal statements just sketched appears to entail the\nexistence of nonactual possible worlds, and hence appears directly to\ncontradict thesis A.  Consequently, actualists either have to try\nto develop a semantics — a theory of meaning — for modal statements\nin terms that do not entail\nthe existence of nonactual possible worlds, or at least to provide an\naccount of possible worlds on which this consequence is rendered\nmetaphysically innocuous. \n\nThe power of the possible worlds semantics — and the distinct\nlack of any persuasive alternatives — is very attractive to many\nactualists, and they are loathe to give it up (so long, of course, as\nthey do not have to abandon actualism). Consequently, actualists\ntypically grasp the second horn of the above dilemma and adopt some\nsort of actualistically acceptable, “sanitized” version of\nthis theory on which possible worlds are conceived as\ntheoretical abstract objects which actually exist. Many such\ntheories of abstractly-conceived worlds have been developed, some with\nbetter success than others (see, for example, Plantinga [1974] and\n[1976], Adams [1974], Fine [1977], Chisholm [1981], van Inwagen\n[1986], or Zalta [1983] and [1993]). Some take worlds to be maximal\npossible states of affairs, others take them to be maximal possible\nproperties or propositions, still others treat them as maximal\nconsistent sets of some sort, and yet others treat them as part of a\nmore general theory of abstract objects.  For purposes here, it will\nserve well enough just to assume some generic version of this view on\nwhich such abstractly conceived worlds can perform their theoretical\ntasks in virtue of certain actualistically unobjectionable modal\nproperties. (A fairly detailed example of such an account, and some of\nits philosophical ramifications, can be found in the supplementary\ndocument\n An Account of Abstract Possible Worlds.) \n\nThe second step in the actualist analysis of modality is to find a way to\ndo without possible but nonactual individuals — also known\nas mere possibilia or contingently nonactual\nindividuals.  The central reason for introducing such entities, at least\nin modern discussions, is this: Possible but nonactual individuals enable\nus to provide compelling semantic analyses of modal claims involving the\nquantifier ‘there is’. To see this, consider, first, a\nnon-modal claim involving such a quantifier: ‘There are\nphilosophers’. Such a claim would typically be regimented in\nfirst-order logic as ‘There is an x such that x is\na philosopher’ or, using more formal notation (in which\n‘Px’ abbreviates the predicate ‘x is a\nphilosopher’): ∃xPx.  On the usual\n“Tarskian”\n semantics[2]\n for  classical, first-order logic, \n given the intended meaning of ‘Px’, the truth\ncondition for this claim is — unsurprisingly —\nthat there is an individual x that is a philosopher.\nAnd because there is in fact such an individual — the\nphilosopher Plato, say — the claim is true.  According to\nTarskian semantics, then, the truth value of a general statement is\ndetermined ultimately by simple facts about whether or not specific\nindividuals exhibit certain properties. \n\nNow consider the modal claim ‘It is possible that there are\nAliens’. It is natural to regiment this claim as ‘It is\npossible that there is an x such that x is an\nAlien’, which is typically formalized as follows: \n\nNow, how are we to understand the truth condition for (1)?  Because\nnothing that actually exists could be an Alien, the truth of (1) does not\nappear to depend upon any simpler facts about individuals.  (1), if true,\nmust simply be a brute fact.  And this seems puzzling: How can that simply\nbe the end of the matter?  How can a rather complex truth about what there\ncould be just be true without being grounded in simpler truths\nabout individuals?  And thus the possibilist: By introducing possible\nworlds and (contingently nonactual) possibilia into our ontology,\nwe can define a truth condition for (1) in terms of simpler facts about\nindividuals in other possible worlds.  Specifically, according to possible\nworld semantics, sentence (1) is true if and only if: \n\nBut, it is a fact about the logic of the quantifier ‘there is’\nthat such quantifiers commute with one another. In other words,\n(2) implies (3): \n\nSo the truth conditions of (1) imply (3). But if (3) is true, then\nso is the ordinary modal claim ‘Something is possibly an\nAlien’, i.e., \n\nfor which (3) provides the truth conditions. Thus, given the simplest\nlogic concerning modal and quantifier claims, (1) implies (4).  In other\nwords, the simplest quantified modal logic tells us that (5) implies\n(6): \n\nThe problem for the second step of the actualist treatment of modality may\nnow be stated more precisely, namely, A is inconsistent with\n(6).  A asserts that everything there is actually exists. But\nthen (6) to asserts the existence of a possible Alien.  By hypothesis,\nhowever, there are no possible Aliens among the actually existing\n individuals.[3] \n Thus, according to the simplest quantified modal logic, our ordinary modal\nbeliefs have logical consequences that seem to be inconsistent with\n actualism.[4] \n The problem described in the previous paragraph resurfaces for the\nactualist in an apparently more troublesome way when we consider sentences\ninvolving quantification into nested, or ‘iterated’, modal\ncontexts. (This problem was first raised in a forceful way by McMichael\n[1983b].)  Consider, for example, the following sentence: \n\n(7) is represented in a standard modal language as follows: \n\nTo see the problem, note that an actualist might successfully develop a\nsemantics that explains the truth of general modal existentials\nlike (1) in a way that avoids the implication from (1) to (4) and hence\navoids appealing to possibilia — indeed, the supplemental\ndocument\n An Account of Abstract Possible Worlds\n seems to provide just such an account.\nHowever, (8), while still general — like (1), it is not, on its\nface, “about” any particular individual — its truth\nconditions seem nonetheless to require a merely possible individual in a\nway that (1) does not.  Like (1), it asserts the general possibility of an\nindividual having a certain property, viz., being a son of\nRatzinger — so far so good.  But it continues on to assert (via\nan occurrence of the initial, existentially quantified variable\n‘x’ within the iterated modal context\n‘◇Px’) a further possibility regarding that\nvery individual: it says that Ratzinger could have had a son a\nand that, possibly — i.e., in some possible world\n— he is a priest.  Unlike (1), then, it appears that (8)\nrequires us to understand the general possibility that there be an\nindividual with a certain property P in terms of a specific\nmere possibile (as no actually existing thing could be\nRatzinger's son) so that we can track that individual from one\npossible world to another to understand the nested possibility that it\nhave another property Q.  So the iterated modal operator in (8)\nappears to force a commitment to possibilia upon us in a way that\n(1) does not.  We will return to the problem of iterated modal operators\nat several points below. \n\nAs the reader who works through the remainder of this essay will\ndiscover, the simplest quantified modal logic has numerous consequences\nthat seem incompatible in some way or another with actualism. In the\nnext section, we will discover still other such consequences. Though we\nhave succeeded in describing the issues surrounding actualism in more\nprecise terms, we have only scratched the surface of the debate. Much\nof the debate turns on the precise characteristics of the modal logic\nbeing proposed as a logic for actualism. This debate can only be\nunderstood if one can contrast the characteristics of these proposed\nalternative logics with the characteristics of the simplest modal\nlogic. Thus, we will spend the next section of this essay describing\nthe characteristics of the simplest modal logic. Only then will we be\nin a position to evaluate the more complicated alternatives developed\nby actualists in the attempt to avoid commitment to nonactual\npossibles. For example, it is important to see just how Kripke's modal\nlogic (Kripke [1963]) employs a variety of special techniques that\nyield a logic consistent with thesis A (these will be documented\nbelow). \n\nThe remaining sections of this essay, therefore, contain the following\nmaterial. In Section 2, we describe, in a precise way, both the\ncharacteristics of the simplest quantified modal logic and its\ncontroversial theorems. (As we acquire more sophisticated logical tools,\nwe will revisit some of the examples already discussed; the redescription\nof these examples in more sophisticated logical terms may prove to be\ninstructive.) We also show why each of the controversial theorems is\nobjectionable from the standpoint of actualism. In Section 3, we outline a\nmodal system developed by Saul Kripke that appears to be consistent with\nthesis A. However, in Section 3.3, we will discover that Kripke's\nsystem introduces special problems of its own. Finally, in Section 4, we\ndiscuss the various attempts actualists have made to solve these problems\nand to find a quantified modal logic and corresponding metaphysics of\nnecessity and possibility that are consistent with thesis A. \n\nRoughly (and rather abstractly) speaking, a logic is a collection of\nformal languages together with a model theory, that is, a formally \nrigorous semantics for those languages that, in particular, yields a precise\naccount of what it means for a formula, or sentence, of a\ngiven language to be true under a given interpretation, or model, of the language.  \n \n A formula of a language\nL is logically true, or valid, if it is\ntrue under any interpretation of L, and a set of\nformulas entails a given formula if the latter is true under any\ninterpretation of L that makes the members of the former\ntrue.  Ideally, validity and entailment for L can be \nprecisely captured in a\nsystem of axioms and rules of inference, in the sense that, for any given formula\nφ of L, (i) φ is valid if and only if it is a theorem of the\nsystem, and (ii) for any set Γ of formulas of L, Γ \nentails φ if and only if φ can be derived from Γ in the system. Validity and entailment as defined in the Tarskian semantics of classical first-order logic can be precisely captured in this sense. \n\nThe languages of first-order modal logic (with identity) are defined just\nlike those of classical first-order logic, but with the following\nadditional clause in the definition of the notion of a formula for a given\nlanguage L: \n More specifically, first-order modal languages will have variables,\nindividual constants,\nn-place predicates, atomic formulas such as\n‘Pacb’ and ‘x=y’, and\nthe usual boolean, quantified, and modal formulas involving the familiar\nlogical constants ‘~’ (negation), ‘→’\n(material conditional), ‘∀’ (the universal quantifier),\nand ‘□’ (the necessity operator). The other common\nboolean connectives ‘∧’ (conjunction), ‘∨’\n(disjunction), and ‘↔’ (material equivalence), the\n‘existential’ quantifier ‘∃’, and the\npossibility operator ◇ are all defined in the usual way.  Notably, the\nformula ◇φ is defined as ~□~φ, reflecting the\nmodal intuition that to say that φ is possibly true is to say that\nφ is not necessarily false.  For convenience, a complete specification\nis provided in Section 1 of the supplementary document\n The Simplest Quantified Modal Logic.  \n It would serve well to spend a moment or two examining these\ndefinitions to making sure that you understand the kinds of statements\nthat are expressible in this language. \n\nThe simplest semantics for first-order modal languages defines, for a\ngiven modal language L, a class of interpretations having two\ndistinguishing features: (1) each interpretation\nI in the class has two mutually exclusive domains — a\nnonempty domain w of possible worlds (which includes a\ndistinguished “actual world” w0) and a\nnonempty domain D of individuals; and (2) given any individuals\na1,…,an in D and\ngiven any possible world w in w, each\ninterpretation I specifies, for each n-place predicate\nπ, whether π applies\nto a1,…,an (respectively)\nat w or not. Given that specification, the semantics then defines\ntruth conditions for every formula of the language. The definition of\ntruth even accommodates “open” formulas (i.e., formulas with\nfree variables) by appealing to assignment functions f\nwhich assign to each variable α some object f(α)\nin D.  (For purposes below, for an assignment function f,\nlet f[α,a] be f if f(α)\n= a, and otherwise let it be the assignment that is exactly\nlike f except that it assigns a to α instead of\nf(α).)  Given an assignment function f, a\ndenotation function d is determined for the terms (constants and\nvariables) of the language generally.  Specifically, if a term τ is a\nconstant, dI,f(τ) is the\nindividual in D that I assigns to τ.  If τ is a\nvariable, then dI,f(τ) is\nf(τ). \n\nGiven an interpretation I for L and an\nassignment f, the notion of truth at a world\n(under I and f) for formulas φ of L is\nthen defined recursively for all of the formulas of the language. The\nthree most important parts of this definition are the clauses for atomic,\nquantified, and modal formulas. Here are examples of each that will be\nespecially useful for purposes here; let w be a world of I: \n\nA formula φ (in which the variable x might occur free) is\nthen defined to be trueI just in case φ is\ntrueI,f at the actual world w0,\nunder every assignment f. (Effectively then, in the definition of\ntruth, formulas free variables are treated as if those variables were all\nuniversally quantified.)  Validity and entailment are defined as indicated\n above. For convenience, one may consult the\nprecise definition in Section 2 of the supplementary document\n The Simplest Quantified Modal Logic.\n It would serve the reader well to study these definitions if they are unfamiliar. \n\nWe now have a logic in the sense noted above — a collection of\nformal languages together with a method of interpreting them — which\nwe will call the Simplest Quantified Modal Logic (SQML).  It is a well\nknown fact that validity and entailment in the semantics for SQML can be\ncaptured in a complete system of axioms and rules of inference\n(a.k.a. a proof theory), which we will refer to as\nas SQML.  (There is no serious danger if one were to forget that\n‘SQML’ refers to the logic and ‘SQML’\nrefers to the proof theory, for given the completeness of SQML,\nin most contexts it doesn't much matter whether we are referring to the\nentire logic or its proof theory.)  SQML combines classical\npropositional logic, classical quantification theory, and the logic with\nidentity — a.k.a. classical first-order logic with identity\n(FOL=) — with S5 propositional modal\nlogic (a.k.a. KT5).  For convenience, we reproduce the axioms and\nrules of inference of these systems in Section 3 of the supplementary\ndocument\n The Simplest Quantified Modal Logic.  \n We presuppose familiarity with FOL= here. The addition of\nS5 strengthens FOL= with three axiom schemas —\nthe K schema, the T schema, and the 5 schema (see below)\n— and the Rule of Necessitation (RN), which permits one to infer\n□φ from any given theorem φ. Each of the axioms of the\nresulting logic SQML is true in every interpretation in the class\ndescribed in the previous paragraph. Moreover, the rules of inference\n‘preserve truth’ (and preserve logical truth). That is, the\nrules of inference permit one to infer only (logical) truths from any set\nof premises consisting solely of (logical) truths. Notice (importantly)\nthat open formulas are assertible as axioms and provable as theorems\nin SQML. Familiarity with this logic will be presupposed in what\nfollows. \n\nThe problem that SQML poses for actualist philosophers is that, while\nall of its logical axioms appear to be true, some of the logical\nconsequences of these axioms appear to be false. Consider first the\nfact that the new modal axioms added by SQML\nto FOL=, i.e., all instances of\nthe K, T, and 5 schemas, all seem\ntrue. The K schema asserts that if a conditional is necessary,\nthen if the antecedent is necessary, so is the consequent: \n\nIt is easy to see that this is true in every interpretation of the\nclass of simplest interpretations: if a conditional is true in every\npossible world and the antecedent of the conditional is true in every\nworld, then the consequent of the conditional is true in every\nworld. \n\nThe T schema asserts that a formula true in every possible world is\nsimply true: \n\nClearly, this is true in all interpretations — if a sentence\nis true in every possible world, it is true in the distinguished actual\nworld. \n\nThe 5 schema asserts that if a formula φ is possible, then it is\nnecessarily the case that it is possible: \n\nIt is not hard to see that this is logically true. If a formula is true in\nsome possible world, then from the point of view of every possible world,\nthe formula is true in some possible world. That is, if a formula is true\nat some possible world, then at every possible world, there is some\npossible world where the formula is true. (The formal validity of\nthe 5 schema is proved in the supplementary document\n The 5 Axiom Schema is Logically True.) \n\nHowever, the controversies surrounding actualism and modal logic center on\nthe following theorems, (the instances of) which are all logically true\nand provable from the axioms and rules of SQML. The first of\nthese is the so-called Barcan Formula (more correctly, the\nBarcan schema), after Ruth Barcan Marcus, who was the first\nlogician to study the principle explicitly (Barcan [1946]): \n\nor, in the equivalent form (by the\n definitions\n of ‘∃’ and ‘◇’) found most often in the\nliterature: \n\nThat all instances of BF are logically true is proved rigorously in\nthe supplementary document\n The Barcan Formula is Logically True.\n That all instances of BF are derivable from the system of\naxioms and rules of SQML follows immediately from the semantic\ncompleteness of that system relative to the semantics of SQML.  (A system\nof axioms of rules is semantically complete relative to a corresponding\nsemantics if every logical truth of the semantics is derivable in the\nsystem.)  However, the proof of this fact (discovered by Prior [1956]) is\nof independent interest and will be relevant to the discussion below, so\nwe display it explicitly in the supplementary document\n Proof of the Barcan Formula in SQML.\n  \n\nTwo further controversial principles we shall discuss are Necessary\nExistence and the Converse Barcan Formula: \n\nDemonstrating that NE and all instances of CBF are logically true in the\nsemantics for SQML is left as an exercise for the reader.  As above,\nhowever, it is useful to see their derivations from the axioms and rules\nof SQML.  These can be found in the supplementary documents\n Proof of NE in SQML \n and \n Proof of CBF in SQML. \n\nWith the logic SQML laid out before us, it is instructive to consider why\nits consequences BF, NE, and CBF offend the\nactualist's philosophical sensibilities. \n  \nConsider first the Barcan Formula.  Our Alien example has already provided\nus with an example of BF in action: where φ is\n‘Ax’, BF asserts that proposition (1) of\nSection 1.2 implies (4), or, in terms of their ordinary language\ncounterparts, that (5) implies (6) — from the mere possibility of\nAliens BF entails that there are, in fact, possible Aliens.  Since,\nby assumption, no actually existing thing could be an Alien, (4) and (6)\nare true only if there are mere possibilia, hence, only if the\nactualist's central principle A is false. \n\nTo facilitate discussion of NE, let us introduce a unary predicate\n‘E!’ to express actual existence.  For the actualist,\nrecall, there is no distinction to be drawn between being and existence,\nbetween the things that are and the things that exist.  Hence, given an\nexplicit predicate to express existence, the actualist principle A\ncan be expressed formally as follows: \n\nBut we can say more.  For the actualist position isn't that it's just an\naccident that there are no mere possibilia; that there just\ndon't, as a matter of fact, happen to be any.  Rather, for the\nactualist, principle A is a necessary truth; it is not even\npossible that there be mere possibilia.  Thus, we can\nstrengthen A to: \n\nwhich we can express more formally in terms of our new predicate as: \n  \nNow, turning our attention to NE proper, the actualist's problem\nwith NE revolves around the notion of contingency.  Possibilists\nand actualists alike can agree that a contingent being is one for whom\nboth existence and nonexistence are, from a metaphysical standpoint,\nequally possible.  That is: \n\nFor an actualist, of course, the first conjunct is superfluous, since\neverything actually exists and hence, obviously, everything possibly\nexists.  But possibilists will want to count nonactual possibilia\n— possible children of Joseph Ratzinger, for example — as\ncontingent as well in virtue of the fact that they\nonly accidentally fail to exist; metaphysically, like actually\nexisting beings that could have failed to exist, their existence and their\nnonexistence are equally possible.  (We therefore adopt the more inclusive\ndefinition in the interest of metaphysical neutrality.)  Actualists and\npossibilists alike, then, generally agree that there are contingent beings\nin the sense above: \n\nNow for the crux of the matter.  For the actualist, we noted, there is no\ndistinction to be drawn between being and existence.  Another way to\nexpress this — perhaps stronger, but common among actualists\n— is to say that there is no difference in meaning between\n‘x exists’ and ‘there is such a\nthing as x’.  Notably, this is the influential view of Quine\n[1948] (p. 23): \n\nHence, actualists often simply define the existence predicate\n‘E!’ in terms of the existential quantifier thus: \nTwo significant consequences follow.  First, under E!Def,\nthesis A, in its formal guise A*, now falls out as\na logical truth of SQML. For it is a simple theorem of the\nfirst-order logic on which SQML is built that everything is identical to\nsomething: ∀x∃y(y = x).\nGiven E!Def, this theorem is exactly A*.  NA* then\nfollows in the proof theory of SQML by an application of the Rule of\nNecessitation. Second, under E!Def, NE —\n∀x□∃y(y = x) — is\nlogically equivalent to: \n\nHence, under the actualist's understanding of existence, NE says\nthat everything exists necessarily and hence (by the\n definitions\n of ‘∃’ and ‘◇’) that nothing can\npossibly fail to exist — ~∃x◇~E!x\n— from which it immediately follows, contrary to CB, that\nthere are no contingent beings, beings (like us) for whom existence\nand nonexistence are equally possible.  Thus Arthur Prior's remark in\n[1957] (p. 48) that classical quantified modal logic (effectively,\nSQML) is “haunted by the myth that whatever exists exists\nnecessarily.” \n  \nIndeed, from an actualist perspective, matters are even worse, as SQML\nentails an even stronger result.  By applying the Rule of Necessitation\nto NE, one obtains: \n\nHence, under E!Def, NNE can be rewritten as: \n\nThat is, for an actualist, it is a theorem of SQML that it\nis necessary that everything necessarily exists, that anything\nthat there could have been already exists necessarily. It follows that it\nis not even possible for there to be contingent beings, contrary\nto very strong, ordinary modal intuitions. \n\nIt is worth noting briefly why the possibilist finds NE\nand NNE\n unproblematic.[5]\n Since the possibilist denies principle A\nand holds that there are in fact things that do not actually\nexist, he will reject the actualist's definition DefE! of the\nexistence predicate ‘E!’; for metaphysical applications\nof SQML, it will simply be introduced as a primitive 1-place predicate.\nThe possibilist can then embrace both CB — that there are\ncontingent beings — and NE/NNE.  For to say that an\nobject is contingent is to say that it either could exist but in fact does\nnot, or that it does exist but in fact might not.  As noted already, for\nthe possibilist, there are of course many examples of both the former and\nthe latter.  CB is thus satisfied.  But, in accord with NE,\nevery contingent being a is nonetheless necessary, in the\nsense that, regardless of whether or not a exists in fact, there\nwould still have been such an object as a.  With the\nrejection of DefE!, NE! no longer follows — from the\nfact that, necessarily, there is such a thing as a it does not\nfollow that a necessarily exists, that a is\nnecessarily actual.\n\n \n\nSo for the possibilist, NE and NNE are unproblematically\ntrue and can be rendered consistent with our modal intuitions by\ndistinguishing being from actual existence.  For actualists, however, who\ncategorically reject any such distinction, NE can mean only that\nall actually existing things are necessarily actual and NNE that\nanything that could have existed already does.  NE and NNE\nthus provide the actualist with additional reasons to abandon SQML. \n\nFinally, there is CBF. For the actualist, the most\nimmediate problem with CBF is simply that the instance \n\ntogether with the actualist thesis NA* entails NE!\ndirectly.  For purposes below, however, it will be useful to point out a\nfurther, related, problem.  Say that a property P or\nrelation R is existence entailing just in case it is not\npossible that anything have P, or bear R to anything,\nwithout existing.  Otherwise put, if an object exemplifies P, or\nbears R to anything, at a world, it exists at that world.  The\nthesis commonly known as serious actualism is that, necessarily,\nall properties and relations are existence-entailing.  (See Plantinga\n[1983] and [1985], Fine [1985], Pollock [1985], Menzel [1991], and Deutsch\n[1994] for further discussion of serious actualism.)  In semantic terms,\nthis amounts to the constraint that an object in the extension of a\nproperty at a world must fall under the range of the quantifier at that\nworld.  More formally, serious actualism can be expressed schematically\nas follows: \n\nDepending on the system, □SA is often derivable by successive\napplications of the laws of Generalization, some basic quantificational\nlogic, and Necessitation from a simpler schema that it will also be useful\nto name explicitly: \n\nSA and □SA are obviously quite consistent with, if not\nentailed by, the actualist point of \n view.[6]\n But given that some property necessarily holds\nof everything, □SA and CBF entail NE!.  (See\n An Informal Derivation of NE! from □SA and CBF.) \n\nGiven the controversial consequences of SQML, one can understand why\nactualists would seek a reformulation of first-order modal logic that\nboth: (1) defines interpretations so that BF, NE,\nand CBF are not logically true, and (2) weakens the proof\ntheory of SQML so that BF, NE, and CBF are not\nderivable as theorems of the logic. Kripke's logic appealed to\nactualists and serious actualists for these very reasons.  The system\nof Kripke [1963] invalidates BF, NE, and CBF both\nmodel-theoretically and proof-theoretically. \n\nIt is illuminating both to see exactly how Kripke was able to\nconstruct interpretations on which BF, NE,\nand CBF are not logically true and to see exactly how Kripke\nmodified the logic of SQML so that these these schemata and sentences\nare no longer theorems. These techniques will be the subject of the\nnext two subsections. \n\nThe key insight in Kripke's (first-order) quantified modal logic is\nthe replacement of the single domain D of individuals in the\ninterpretation of a first-order modal language with a function\ndom that assigns to each world w of the interpretation its\nown distinct domain of individuals\ndom(w). No restrictions are placed on\nthe domain of a world; any set of individuals, including the empty set,\nwill do. Thus, instead of a single domain common to all worlds, domains\nare permitted to vary from world to world. Intuitively, of course,\ndom(w) represents the objects that\nexist in w. In particular, the domain of the\nactual world represents — of course — the things that are\nactual, the things that exist simpliciter. Interpretations like this\nfor first-order modal languages in which each world has its own domain\nare known as Kripke models. \n\nThe central semantic difference between Kripke models and\ninterpretations for SQML is that, in a Kripke model, when a quantified\nformula ∀xφ is evaluated at a world\nw, the quantifier ranges only over the objects that\nexist in the domain of w. Thus, in particular, the\nsample clause in the definition of truth for quantification above must\nbe revised for Kripke models M as follows, where,\nagain, f is an assignment function and w a world of M: \n\nAgain, a little less formally, under the Kripke model M and assignment f, ‘∀xPx’ is\ntrue at\nw just in case, for all individuals a\nthat exist in w, the predicate\n‘P’ applies to a at\nw. \n\nKripke's changes to the semantics of first-order modal languages\nare relatively simple. Nonetheless, unlike the semantics for SQML,\nKripke's semantics yields a set of logical truths that is fully\ncompatible with actualism. In particular, all three of the principles\nwith which the actualist takes issue — BF, NE,\nand CBF — turn out to be invalid in Kripke's\nsemantics. Consider first BF in the form \n\nFor definiteness, let φ be the formula ‘Ax’\nexpressing that x is an Alien (in the sense of\n ‘Alien’\n introduced above). As we\nnoted, even though there are no Aliens in the actual world\nw0, there could have been; that is, there\nis a possible world w in which there are Aliens. Thus,\non Kripke's way of evaluating quantified formulas, the antecedent\nto BF — ‘◇∃xAx’ —\ncomes out true at the actual world:\n‘◇∃xAx’ is true at\nw0 if and only if there is some world\nu at which ‘∃xAx’ is true,\nand that, in turn, is true at such a u just in case\nsome entity that exists in u is an Alien\nthere. Assuming, as we are, that there is such a world, then,\n‘◇∃xAx’ is indeed true, i.e., true at\nthe actual world. However, as we also noted, no actually existing thing\nis an Alien. Thus, there is nothing in the domain of the actual world\nsuch that ‘◇Ax’ is true of it, that is,\nnothing a in the actual world and no world\nu are such that ‘A’ is true of\na at u. So, in the case in question,\nthe antecedent of BF is true, but the consequent is\nfalse. So BF is not valid, that is, there are models in which\nsome of its instances are false. \n\nIt should be obvious why NE is also invalid in Kripke's\nsemantics: domains of worlds can be empty. Thus, let\nM1 be a Kripke model containing at least\none actual individual (i.e., at least one object\na∈dom(w0))\nand a world w that has an empty domain. Then,\nobviously, a does not exist in w,\nand hence ‘∃y(y=x)’ is false at\nw when a is assigned to ‘x’. Thus,\n‘□∃y(y=x)’ is false\nat w0 when a is assigned to\n‘x’, and so, because a is in the domain of\nthe actual world w0, NE is false in\nM1. \n\nAlthough Kripke's semantics does not presuppose serious actualism,\nit is consistent with it, so it is still important that CBF turn out\ninvalid in the semantics to avoid the argument to NE noted above when\nserious actualism is assumed.  To see that CBF is indeed invalid, first,\nlet M2 be a Kripke model in which NE is false. (We just\nproved the existence of such a model in the previous paragraph, of\ncourse.)  Next, let the predicate ‘P’ express a\nproperty in M2 that is necessarily both\nexistence-entailing and universal, that is, a property which is\nexemplified at each world w by everything that exists at w\nand by nothing else.  The property existence, of course, is the\nsimplest example of such a property.  We can represent the universal,\nexistence-entailing character of this property formally\nin M2 simply by stipulating that the extension of\n‘P’ at any world\nw of M2 is\ndom(w), so that all and only the things that exist at each\nworld are in the extension of ‘P’ at that world. Now,\nnote that, under these conditions, it is true in\nM2 (i.e., true at the actual world\nw0 of M2) that\n□∀xPx: intuitively, everything that exists in every\npossible world has the property P (i.e., the property that the\npredicate ‘P’ denotes) in that world. Let\na be any object in the actual world\nw0 that fails to exist in some world\nw. (Since, by hypothesis, NE fails in\nM2, there must be such an object in\ndom(w0).) Because\nP is existence-entailing, a is not in the\nextension of ‘P’ at w. So there\nis something in the actual world w0 that\ndoes not have the property P in every possible world, i.e.,\n‘∀x□Px’ is false in\nM2. Hence, the instance\n‘□∀xPx→∀x□Px’\nof CBF is false in M2. \n\nNote that the invalidity of CBF reopens the door to serious\nactualism SA in Kripke's semantics, as it was the combination\nof SA with CBF that led to trouble (i.e., trouble for\nthe actualist) in SQML.  And it is easy to see formally that this is\nthe case by constructing a Kripke model in which SA is\ntrue. Note first that the thesis of serious actualism can be expressed\nas the thesis that all properties are existence-entailing; there is no\npossible world in which something has a property but fails to exist in\nthat world. In first-order languages, properties are represented by\npredicates, and having a property is represented semantically by being\nin the extension of a predicate.  Thus, to represent a property as\nexistence-entailing in a Kripke model, one simply ensures that, at\nevery possible world w, the extension of the predicate\nrepresenting that property consist only of things that exist\nin w. Hence, to represent\nall properties as existence entailing, and hence, to make SA\ntrue, one ensures that this is so for all the predicates of one's\nlanguage. Formally, then, let M3 be any\nKripke model satisfying the condition that, for every n-place\npredicate F and world w, F is\ninterpreted so that, at w, F applies only to\nthings that exist in w; more formally, for individuals\na1,…,an\nof M3, F applies to\na1,…,an\nat w only if\na1,…,an\n∈ dom(w). This condition ensures\nthat SA (indeed □SA) is true in M3. \n\nThe compatibility of SA with Kripke's semantics is yet further\nevidence of its suitability as a formal semantics for the actualist. A\nquestion that remains is: What sort of logic does this\nsemantics yield? \n\nA logic formulated in a given language L* is said\nto be sound with respect to a semantics for\nL* if and only if every formula of L*\nthat is a theorem of the logic is valid (logically true) relative to\nthat semantics (i.e., is true in every interpretation or model of the\nsemantics). A logic is said to be complete with respect to a\nsemantics for L* if and only if every formula of\nL* that is valid relative to that semantics is a\ntheorem of the logic. A sound and complete logic for a semantics is a\ngood thing, of course, as it provides a purely syntactic,\nproof-theoretic mechanism for demonstrating the semantic validity of\nformulas in the\n language.[7] \n\nSQML is sound and complete relative to the semantics given above for\nits language L. Since, as we saw in the previous\nsection, BF, NE, and CBF are invalid in Kripke's\nsemantics, SQML is obviously not sound with respect to that semantics.\nHence, Kripke must modify\nSQML to block their derivation without blocking the derivation of any\nvalid formulas. \n\nThere are two elements to Kripke's solution to this problem. Note\nfirst that a typical proof of NE will involve open formulas (i.e.,\nformulas containing free variables) to which the Rule of Necessitation is\nsubsequently applied.  Notably the proof in the supplementary\ndocument\n Proof of NE in SQML\n makes use of the following logical axioms (see lines 1 and 2): \n\nBy contraposition and the definition of the existential quantifier, the\nlatter axiom is equivalent to ‘x=x →\n∃y(y=x)’. Thus, given\n‘x=x’, we have\n‘∃y(y=x)’. The crucial step now is the\napplication of Necessitation in line 6 to this formula — containing,\nwe note, a free occurrence of ‘x’ — to yield\n‘□∃y(y=x)’, which in turn\nyields NE, by the Rule of Generalization. \n\nTo repair this “flaw” in SQML, Kripke adopts\nthe generality interpretation of theorems containing free\nvariables, that is: a formula φ containing free variables\nα1,…,αn, when asserted\nas a theorem (and hence, in particular, as an axiom), is taken to be an\nabbreviation for its universal closure\n⌈∀α1…∀αnφ⌉.\nThus, under this proposal, the proof of NE noted above fails. For\nthe axioms used in the proof, because they involve free variables, cannot\nstand as they are. Rather, they must be taken to be abbreviations of\n \n\nrespectively. From the second axiom displayed above we can derive\n‘∀x(x=x →\n∃y(y=x))’ and, from this\n‘∀x(x=x) →\n∀x∃y(y=x)’ (by the\nquantifier distribution axiom). So using the first axiom displayed above,\nwe can now derive\n‘∀x∃y(y=x)’ by Modus\nPonens, and, finally, by Necessitation we can derive only\n‘□∀x∃y(y=x)’. This\nlatter proposition, for Kripke, is uproblematically and uncontroversially\ntrue — in every possible world, every individual existing in that\nworld is identical to something (viz., itself). To derive NE from\nthis, however, we need CBF — in particular, the instance\n‘□∀x∃y(y=x) →\n∀x□∃y(y=x)’. But, as\nKripke points out, the usual SQML proof of CBF also depends\nessentially on an application of Necessitation to an open formula derived\nby universal instantiation — the same “flaw” that\ninfects the proof of NE.  (See the inference from line 1 to line 2\nin the supplementary document\n Proof of the Converse Barcan Formula in S5.)\n Hence, it, too, fails under the\ngenerality interpretation of free variables. The proof of BF found\n in\n Proof of the Barcan Formula in S5\n fails for the same reason. Hence, the\nusual SQML proofs of all three actualistically unacceptable principles\nfail in Kripke's system. \n\nHowever, the generality interpretation of theorems containing free\nvariables is not quite enough to purge quantified modal logic\nof NE and its ilk. For valid proofs of NE, BF,\nand CBF can still be generated in SQML from the proofs noted by\nsimply replacing free occurrences of the variable\n‘x’ with occurrences of a constant\n‘c’. The second element of Kripke's solution,\ntherefore, is to banish constants from the language of quantified\nmodal logic; that is, to specify the language of quantified modal\nlogic in such a way that variables are the only terms. \n\nNote that, because theorems involve neither constants nor free variables\nin Kripke's system, the Rule of Generalization has no purchase; any\nquantifier prefixed to a theorem in virtue of the rule would be vacuous\n(and hence could be inferred from the easily provable\ntheorem ⌈φ →\n∀αφ⌉, for α not occurring free in\nφ). However, there remain validities of Kripke's system that, in SQML,\ncan only be proved by applications of Generalization to theorems\ncontaining free variables, e.g., ‘∀x(Px\n→ Px)’. Moreover, the inability to assert theorems\ncontaining free variables makes it impossible to prove any de re\nmodal validities. For the logical form of all such propositions involves a\nmodal operator within the scope of a quantifier, and hence, the proof of\nany such proposition would appear to require the application of\nNecessitation to a formula in which a variable occurs free —\n‘∀x□(Px → Px)’,\nfor example, in SQML, requires the application of the Rule of\nNecessitation to ‘Px → Px’ followed,\nonce again, by an application of Generalization. \n\nKripke's solution cleverly involves jettisoning both Generalization and\nNecessitation as rules of inference and incorporating just enough of them\nas needed into the statement of his logical axioms — slightly\nrevised from their SQML guises. In particular, Kripke's system declares\nthe result of prefixing universal quantifiers and modal operators, in any\norder, to propositional tautologies (whether or not they contain free\nvariables) to be axioms. Thus, in particular, both\n‘∀x(Px → Px)’ and\n‘∀x□(Px → Px)’\ncount as axioms in Kripke's system. \n\nKripke's system is presented in detail in\nthe supplementary document\n Kripke's Quantified Modal Logic.\n With his modifications in place — broadly, the generality\ninterpretation of free variables, the removal of individual constants,\nand the relocation of Generalization and Necessitation into the\nlogical axioms themselves — Kripke is able to demonstrate that\nhis system is sound and complete relative to his semantics. Soundness,\nin particular, tells us that no invalid formula is provable in the\nsystem. Hence, since NE, CBF, and BF are all invalid in Kripke's\nsemantics, soundness guarantees that they are all unprovable in his\nsystem. \n\nOn the face of it, Kripke's logic provides the actualist with a\npowerful alternative to SQML. However, although BF, NE, and CBF are\nneither valid nor provable in Kripke's system, the system is open to\nseveral serious objections. \n\nFirst, Kripke regards the loss of free variables from assertible\nsentences as a mere inconvenience. But this seems much too facile; a\ngreat deal of mathematical reasoning is carried out in terms of\nformulas with free variables, especially when reasoning about\n\"arbitrary\" objects from which one intends to draw general conclusions.\nOne should at least wonder why such reasoning cannot be carried out in\na modal logic. Far more serious, however, is the loss of individual\nconstants. It is surely a sad irony that a system whose motivation is\nto capture our modal intuitions — most notably, intuitions about\ncontingency — cannot so much as permit us to talk about specific\ncontingent individuals and say of those individuals\nthat they are contingent. \n\nAlarming as this problem might be, however, it is in fact more a\nformal rather than a philosophical objection to Kripke's system.\nAlthough Kripke himself might not be particularly pleased at the\nprospect, it seems that the proper response to these problems is simply\nto alter those features of classical quantification theory and/or\nclassical propositional modal logic that give rise to invalid\ninferences such as the above. (Arguably, Kripke has already made a\nsimilar move in adopting the generality interpretation of free\nvariables.) Obvious suspects here are universal instantiation and\nnecessitation. After all, there is nothing sacrosanct about either\nclassical quantification theory or classical modal logic. If they are\ninconsistent with strong modal intuitions, then their revision is\nrequired and fully warranted. \n\nSo its current inability to name contingent beings does not of itself\nconstitute much of an objection to Kripke's system. It is likely that\nit could be patched up so as to allow it this expressive capacity.\nFar more serious is the fact that, despite the invalidity and\nunprovability of the actualistically objectionable\nprinciples BF, NE, and CBF, Kripke's system does\nnot appear to have escaped ontological commitment to possibilia. A\nsemantics for a language provides, in particular, an\naccount of how the truth value of a given sentence of the language is\ndetermined in a model by the meanings of its semantically significant\ncomponent parts, notably, the meanings of its names, predicates, and\nquantifiers. Now, truth-in-a-model is not the same as truth\nsimpliciter. However, truth simpliciter is usually understood simply\nto be truth in an intended model, a model consisting of the\nvery things that the language is intuitively understood to be\n“about”. So if we are to take Kripke models seriously as\nan account of truth for modal languages, then we must identify the\nintended models of those languages. And for this there seems little\noption but to take Kripke's talk of possible worlds literally: the set\nW in an intended Kripke model is the set of all possible worlds. If\nso, however, it appears that Kripke is committed to possibilia. For\nsuppose that the modal operators, properly interpreted, are literally\nquantifiers over possible worlds. And suppose it is possible that\nthere be objects — Aliens, for example — that are distinct\nfrom all actually existing objects.  Letting ‘A’\nexpress the property of being an Alien, we can represent this\nproposition by means of the sentence ‘◇∃yAy\n∧ ~∃x◇Ax’, i.e., while there\ncould be Aliens (◇∃yAy), no actually\nexisting thing could be an Alien\n(~∃x◇Ax). On Kripke's semantics, the first\nconjunct of this sentence can be true only if there is a possible\nworld w and an object a such that a is an\nAlien at w. But given the second conjunct, any such\nobject a is distinct from all actually existing\nthings. Hence, using Kripke's semantics to provide us with an account\nof truth, we find ourselves quantifying directly over possible worlds\nand mere possibilia (see Williamson [2000], 206-7).\nThat BF, NE, and\nCBF are unprovable in Kripke's system, it seems, is metaphysically\nirrelevant.  For it appears that, nonetheless, the semantics itself is\nwholly committed to possibilism. \n\nAn option for the actualist here, perhaps, is simply to deny that Kripke\nmodels have any genuine metaphysical bite. The real prize is the logic,\nwhich describes the modal facts of the matter directly.  Kripke's\nsemantics is simply a formal instrument that enables us to\nprove that the logic possesses certain desirable metatheoretic features,\nnotably consistency. But this position is unsatisfying at best. Consider\nordinary Tarskian semantics for nonmodal first-order\nlogic. Intuitively, this semantics is more than just a formal\nartifact. Rather, when one constructs an intended model for a given\nlanguage, it shows clearly how the semantic values of the relevant parts\nof a sentence of first-order logic — the objects, properties,\nrelations, etc. in the world those parts signify — contribute to the\nactual truth value of the sentence. The semantics provides insight into\nthe “word-world” connection that explains how it is that\nsentences can express truth and falsity, how they can carry good and bad\ninformation. The embarrassing question for the actualist who would adopt\nthe proposed instrumentalist view of Kripke semantics is: what\ndistinguishes Kripkean semantics from Tarskian? Why does the latter\nyield insight into the word-world connection and not the former? Distaste\nfor the metaphysical consequences of Kripke semantics at best provides a\nmotivation for finding an answer to these questions, but it is not itself\nan answer. The actualist owes us either an explanation of how Kripke's\nsemantics for modal languages does not commit\nus to possibilism, or else he owes us a semantical alternative. \n\nWe now turn to the work of actualists who have tried to address the\npossibilist challenge. The relevant literature is quite extensive, but\nactualist responses to the challenge seem largely to fall into two broad\ncategories, which we will call trace and no-trace, or\nstrict, actualism. The difference comes down to this. Actualists\nand possibilists alike agree that there are (in at least some\nsense or other) contingent beings, beings that actually exist but which\n(in at least some sense or other) might have failed to be.  Trace\nactualists believe alongside possibilists that, necessarily, for any\ncontingent being x, even if x had failed to be (in the\nrelevant sense), there would still have been some sort of metaphysical\nvestige, or trace, of x, either the object x itself in some\nontologically attenuated state or a surrogate, or proxy, thereof (Bennett\n[2006]).[8]\nConsequently, for the trace actualist, as for the possibilist, there\nwould still have been information about x, i.e., true or\nfalse propositions definitely and specifically about x, notably,\nthe proposition [x does not exist]. Structurally, then, the\nsemantical universe of the trace actualist looks quite a lot like the\npossibilist's universe — for every merely possible object on the\npossibilist's account, one finds instead an actualistically acceptable\nvestige of that object. Hence, the trace actualist is able to\nreconstruct quantified modal logic along the lines of one of their\npossibilist counterparts, SQML or Kripke's logic. Strict actualists, by\ncontrast, categorically reject the idea that there are, or could have\nbeen, traces of nonexistent objects and consequently often find themselves\nforced to accept rather more awkward quantified modal logics that are more\nsuited to their metaphysical commitments. \n\nThere are any number of representatives of, and variations on, these two\ncategories of actualist. For brevity, I will focus only on a few salient\naccounts. \n\nWe begin with a form of trace actualism that offers a way to preserve\nthe formal, theoretical benefits of SQML in its entirety simply by\nreinterpreting its intended semantics so as to eliminate its apparent\ncommitment to possibilia. On this form of actualism, the truth\ncondition for the modal claim “There might have been Aliens”\nis just what it appears to be on the semantics of SQML, namely, that in\nsome possible world, there is an object that is an Alien at that world.\nHowever, this truth condition does not commit us to\nmere possibilia, to entities that fail to be actual. Instead, the\nnew form of actualism is based on the idea that this truth condition is\ncommitted to the existence of contingently nonconcrete objects,\ni.e., actually existing objects that are, in fact, nonconcrete, but which\ncould have been Aliens (hence could have been concrete). This theory has\nbeen recently put forward by Linsky and Zalta ([1994], [1996]) and\nWilliamson ([1998], [1999], [2013]) (though Williamson eschews the word\n‘actual’ (as well as ‘being’) in his formulation\nof the theory and speaks only in terms of ‘existence’ and its\ncognates). These philosophers claim that a nonconcrete object of the sort\nin question is not an Alien, but instead has the modal property of\npossibly being an Alien. In other words, modal claims such as “There\nmight have been Aliens” (formalized, once again, as (1)) can be\ninterpreted to be true in virtue of the actual existence of objects that\nare nonconcrete (and hence which are not Aliens) at our world, but which\nare Aliens (and hence concrete) at some other possible world. Thus,\nunlike possibilia, the nonconcrete objects involved in the truth\nconditions of such modal claims actually exist. To say this is to use\n‘exist’ and ‘actual’ similar to they way\nPlatonists use them when they claim that mathematical objects exist or are\nactual. However, unlike mathematical objects, which\nare necessarily nonconcrete, the objects required for the truth\nof modal claims are only contingently nonconcrete — they are\nnonconcrete at our world but concrete at other possible worlds. Similarly,\nordinary concrete objects (like the tables, animals, planets, etc., of our\nworld) are assumed to be contingently concrete — they are concrete\nat some worlds (including ours) and not at other worlds. \n\nWith this basic idea in hand, the “new actualists” (to give\nthem a simple label) point out that our ordinary modal claims can be given\na straightforward analysis by: (1) regimenting ordinary modal discourse in\nthe simplest possible way using SQML and (2) semantically interpreting\nSQML by appealing to contingently concrete objects and contingently\nnonconcrete objects (both of which are assumed to actually exist). This\ninterpretation, the new actualist argues, allows him to accept\nprinciple A and its formal expression A* — taking the\nexistence predicate ‘E!’ to be defined as\nin DefE! — and reveals that the controversial consequences of\nSQML — BF, CBF, and NE/NE* — do\nnot contradict our modal intuitions, once those intuitions are understood\nin terms of a more subtle conception of the abstract/concrete\ndistinction. \n\nTo see why, reconsider the definition and discussion of SQML and reexamine\nBF. For an actualist, from the fact that there might have been\naliens (◇∃xAx), BF entails that there exists\nsomething that could have been an Alien\n(∃x◇Ax).  But, it was asked, doesn't this\ncontradict the intuition (described at the very outset) that no\nactually existing thing could have been an Alien? Here, the new\nactualist argues that this intuition is legitimate only when it is\nproperly understood as the intuition that no concrete thing\ncould have been an Alien. Recall that our thought experiment asked us\nto “imagine a race of beings that is very different from any\nlife-form that actually exists anywhere in the universe; different enough,\nin fact, that no actually existing thing could have been an Alien, any\nmore than a given gorilla could have been a fruitfly.” According to\nthe new actualist, the relevant intuition here — that nothing could\nhave been an Alien — is grounded in the fact that when we look\naround us and examine all the concrete objects there are, we note\nthat none of them could have been an Alien (just as no gorilla\ncould have been a fruitfly).  However, this leaves room to claim that\nthere exist (contingently) nonconcrete objects which could have\nbeen Aliens. According to the new actualist, these contingently\nnonconcrete objects have been overlooked because (1) no one has correctly\ndrawn the proper distinction between contingently nonconcrete and\nnecessarily nonconcrete objects, and (2) everyone has assumed that\nconcreteness was an essential property of concrete objects (see\nbelow). \n\nThus, according to the new actualist, whenever there is a true claim of\nthe form “There could have been something which\nis F”, BF doesn't imply anything that is\nincompatible with our modal intuitions. For the conclusion that it\nentails, namely, that “There exists something that could have been\nan F”, does not require us to suppose that there is\nsome concrete object that could have\nbeen F. Rather, BF requires only the existence of\na something that could have been F, and that thing might\nwell be contingently nonconcrete. \n\nNE and CBF are equally harmless according to the new\nactualist. For, while it is true that Socrates exists necessarily on the\nnew actualist's account, he is not a “necessary being”. For a\nnecessary being is one whose ontological status does not change from world\nto world — it is either concrete in every possible world or\nnonconcrete in every possible world. Socrates, by contrast, is concrete in\nsome worlds and nonconcrete in others. There is thus still a robust sense\nin which Socrates is a contingent being — he might have failed to be\nconcrete, failed to exist in space and time.  And that, the new actualist\nargues, is the actual foundation of our belief that Socrates is a\ncontingent being.  Similar to the possibilist, then, since the existential\nquantifier ranges over absolutely all the things there could be —\nnecessarily/contingently concrete and necessarily/contingently nonconcrete\nalike — the new actualist, too, will not accept\n the original definition of contingency above.\n Rather, she will introduce an additional predicate C! to express\nthe property of being concrete and define contingency accordingly: \nThat is, a contingent being is one for whom both concreteness and\nnoncreteness are equally possible.  Since, therefore, NE is an\nactualistically acceptable consequence of SQML, the Converse Barcan\nFormula (CBF) is rendered acceptable as well, for the fact that it,\ntogether with thesis A or serious actualism (SA),\nimplies NE!, is of no consequence for the new actualist. \n\nOnce it is seen that BF, NE, and CBF require only\ncontingently nonconcrete objects and not possibilia, it is\nnatural to reconceive the nature of concrete objects. According to new\nactualism, ordinary concrete beings are concrete at some worlds and not at\nothers. This, as just noted above, is the sense in which they are\ncontingent. Traditional actualists have described worlds where these\nobjects are not concrete as worlds where these objects have no sort of\nbeing whatever. By contrast, the new actualist just rests with their\nnonconcreteness at the world in question, and argues that that should\nsuffice to account for our intuition that such objects “are not to\nbe found” in such a world. Moreover, new actualists reconceive the\nidea of an “essential” property of a concrete object. Instead\nof saying that Socrates is essentially a person because he is a person in\nevery possible world where he exists, new actualists say that he is\nessentially a person because he is a person in every world where he is\nconcrete. \n\nSo by recognizing the existence of contingently nonconcrete objects and by\nreconceptualizing both the contingency of concrete objects and the notion\nof an essential property in what seem to be harmless ways, there appears\nto be a way to interpret SQML so that it is consistent with actualism.\nSpecifically, in the “intended” new actualist model of SQML,\neverything in the one domain D both is and is actual. To\naccount for the validity of BF, NE, and CBF, D\nis understood to include: (1) contingently concrete objects, (2)\ncontingently nonconcrete objects, and, if there are such (3) necessarily\nconcrete objects and (4) necessarily nonconcrete objects. All of these\nobjects in D, according to the new actualist, actually exist. \n\nBy reconceptualizing possibilia, then, new actualism appears to\noffer a very simple and elegant solution to the possibilist challenge that\ninvolves no theoretical alteration to the language, semantics, or proof\ntheory of SQML. In particular, the new actualist is able to preserve\nsimple and straightforward truth conditions for our paradigmatic modal\nclaim (1) as well as more complicated propositions like (7) and (8) that\ninvolve nested modalities. (Further details are provided in the\nsupplementary document\n New Actualism and Iterated Modalities\n for the interested reader.) Thus, the new actualists can argue that\ntheir view shows why a single formalism, SQML, suffices as a\nregimentation for the modal claims of natural language no matter\nwhether one is an actualist or a possibilist. Both possibilists and\nactualists can employ SQML to represent our modal beliefs, though each\nwill interpret the formalism in different ways to suit their own\npurposes.  New actualism thus appears to show, somewhat surprisingly,\nthat SQML is metaphysically neutral. \n\nObjections to new actualism are addressed in the document\n Problems with the Actualist Accounts. \n One of the best known responses to the possibilist challenge was developed\nby Alvin Plantinga [1974].  First, Plantinga analyzes possible worlds on the \napproach described at the end of Section 1.1 above and in the supplementary\ndocument \n An Account of Abstract Possible Worlds. \n To summarize: he defines world to be a state of affairs of a\ncertain sort.  A state of affairs for Plantinga is a proposition-like\nentity that either obtains — [Socrates' having been a\nphilosopher], say — or does not — [There being\nAliens], say.  One state of affairs s includes\nanother s′ if it is not possible that s obtain\nwithout s′ obtaining.  A state of affairs is\na possible world, then, just in case it is possible that it\nincludes all and only the states of affairs that obtain.  Since, for\nPlantinga, worlds are states of affairs and states of affairs are all\nactually existing abstract entities, his account addresses  the\nchallenge that possible worlds pose for actualists. \n\nSecond, the heart of Plantinga's answer to the challenge of possible\nobjects is the notion of an individual essence. Plantinga's\nprecise definition of this notion is a bit complex, but the idea itself is\nquite simple. Consider first the venerable distinction\nbetween essential and accidental\nproperties. Intuitively, the essential properties of an object are those\nproperties that make the object “what it is”. More exactly,\nthey are the properties that the object couldn't possibly have lacked. Its\naccidental properties, by contrast, are those that it just happens to have\nbut might well have lacked. Thus, the property [being a horse] is\nintuitively not a property that the champion racehorse Secretariat could\nhave lacked; he couldn't have been a rabbit, say, or a stone. The\nproperty [being a horse] is thus essential to the 1973 Triple Crown\nwinner Secretariat. By contrast, Secretariat could easily have lacked the\nproperty [being a racehorse]. Under different circumstances —\nif, say, he'd injured a leg as a colt — he might have spent his days\nfrolicking in the fields. That property is therefore accidental to\nSecretariat. So the first part of the definition of an individual essence\n— the “essence” part — is that an individual\nessence is an essential property of anything that has it. And the\n“individual” part of the definition is simply that if\nsomething has a given individual essence, then nothing else could possibly\nhave that same individual essence. (We provide the definition Plantinga\nactually uses in the document\n Plantinga's Definition of an Individual Essence.) \n\nExamples of individual essences are a little harder to come by than\nexamples of essential properties. There are fairly strong intuitive\ngrounds for the thesis that having arisen from the exact sperm and egg\nthat one has is an individual essence of every human person, or at least\nof every human body. A different sperm and the same egg, say, would have\nresulted in a perhaps similar but numerically distinct person. Less\ncontroversial from a purely logical standpoint are what Plantinga\ncalls haecceities, i.e., “purely nonqualitative”\nproperties like [being Plantinga], or perhaps, [being identical with\nPlantinga], that do no more than directly characterize the object per\nse as that very thing, and nothing more. Pretty clearly,\nPlantinga has the property [being Plantinga] essentially — he could\nnot exist and lack it; any world in which he exists is, ex\nhypothesi, a world in which he is Plantinga, and hence a\nworld in which he exhibits the property in question. Moreover, nothing but\nthe individual Plantinga could have had that property; necessarily,\nanything that has it is identical to Plantinga. Hence, [being\nPlantinga] is an individual essence. Importantly, Plantinga takes\nindividual essences, like all properties, to exist necessarily, even if\nthey are not exemplified. (Interested readers may wish to read the\nsupplementary document\n Background Assumptions for Plantinga's Account.) \n\nBriefly put, Plantinga's solution to the possibilist challenge is to\nreplace the possibilia of Kripke's semantics with individual essences,\nin particular, with haecceities.  We follow the development of this\nsolution found in Jager [1982] (which Plantinga [1979, n. 8]\nendorses).  As in Kripke's semantics, this semantics is designed for a\nfirst-order modal language L* with no individual constants.  An\ninterpretation I of L* consists again of two mutually\ndisjoint nonempty sets: the set of possible worlds and the set of\nhaecceities. And, as with Kripke, there is a function\ndom that assigns to each possible world w its own\ndistinct domain dom(w). However, instead of the possible\nindividuals that exist in w, this domain consists of those\nhaecceities that are exemplified in w, or more\nexactly, that would have been exemplified if w had\nbeen actual. To highlight this important metaphysical difference with\nKripke's semantics, Plantinga refers to these essences collectively as\nthe essential domain of w. \n\nBut how, exactly, does I assign values to predicates?  After all,\nit is not haecceities to which predicates apply at worlds, it is the\nthings that exemplify them; [being an Alien], if it were\nexemplified, would not be a property of essences, but of\nindividuals. Plantinga's trick is to talk, not about exemplification,\nbut coexemplification. Properties\nP and Q are coexemplified just in case some\nindividual exemplifies both P and\nQ. So, for example, given that there are men who are philosophers,\nthe properties [being a man] and [being a philosopher] are\ncoexemplified in the actual world.  For any world w, we say that\nP and Q are coexemplified in\nw just in case w includes [P and Q's being\ncoexemplified].  Thus, given that it is possible that there be, say,\npurple Aliens, the properties [being purple] and [being an\nAlien] are coexemplified in some possible world w.  More\ngenerally, a relation R is coexemplified with properties\nP1,…,Pn\n(in that order) just in case (i) there exist individuals\ni1,…,in\nthat exemplify\nP1,…,Pn,\nrespectively, and (ii)\ni1,…,in (respectively)\nstand in the relation R. And for any world\nw, R is coexemplified with\nproperties\nP1,…,Pn (respectively)\nin w just in case w includes [R's being coexemplified with\nP1,…,Pn].\n \n\nIn Plantinga's system, then, a 1-place predicate P applies\nto a given haecceity e at a world\nw just in case the property expressed by P is\ncoexemplified with the e at\nw. And an n-place predicate R applies to haecceities\ne1,…,en at w\njust in case the relation expressed by\nR is coexemplified with\ne1,…,en\nat w. For any haecceities\ne1,…,en\nand possible world w in our interpretation\nI, then, I specifies, for each\nn-place predicate R, whether or not R\napplies to\ne1,…,en at w.\nNote that, because Plantinga is a committed \n serious actualist,\n the assignment of haecceities to predicates\nby I is so constrained that a predicate can be applied to\nhaecceities e1,…,en\nat w only\nif e1,…,en are in the\nessential domain of w. \n\nThe denotation function f for I works fundamentally just as\nin SQML and Kripke's logic, only now, of course, it assigns\nhaecceities to variables instead of possibilia.  There is, however, an\nimportant difference in the assignment of truth values to sentences.\nSpecifically, unlike Kripke, Plantinga assigns uses a de re\ninterpretation of negation and necessity in assigning truth values to\nsentences.  That is, for Plantinga, sentences of the form ~φ and\n□φ that contain a free variable, ‘x’, say, are\nthought of as predicating properties (negative or modal, as the case may\nbe) to the individual whose haecceity is assigned to\n‘x’.  To illustrate, suppose ‘x’ is\ntaken to denote Socrates' haecceity hs and the\n‘P’ expresses the property of being a philosopher.\nThen, under the denotation assignment in question,\n‘~Px’ is true at a world w just in case\nSocrates's haecceity hs is coexemplified with the\nproperty of failing to be a philosopher at w.  But since Plantinga\nis a serious actualist, Socrates must exist at w in order for this\nto be so.  Hence, for Plantinga, ‘~Px’ is true\nat w just in case (i) Socrates'\nhaecceity hs is in the essential domain of w and\n(ii) it is not the case that hs is coexemplified\nwith [being a philosopher] at w.  By the same token, for\nPlantinga, ‘□Px’ is true at w just in case\nSocrates has the property of being a philosopher essentially\nat w.  Hence, for Plantinga, ‘□Px’ is true\nat w just in case (i) Socrates'\nhaecceity hs is in the essential domain of w and\n(ii) hs is coexemplified with [being a philosopher]\nat every possible world w* in which it is exemplified (i.e., in\nwhich Socrates exists). \n\nWe illustrate the most important clauses of Plantinga's formal\nhaecceitist semantic theory with some simple cases: \n\nReferring back to our Alien example, then, the proposition that it is\npossible that there are Aliens, ◇∃xAx, is true on this\naccount if and only if there is a possible world\nw and a haecceity e such that\n‘A’ applies to e at\nw, i.e., if and only if the property [being an Alien]\nand e are coexemplified in\nw.  However, since no such haecceity is exemplified in the actual\nworld, i.e., since there is no such haecceity in its essential domain,\nnothing (i.e., nothing actual) is a possible Alien, that is, \n∃x◇Ax is false.  Hence, as in Kripke's semantics,\nthe Barcan Formula is invalid on Plantinga's semantics.\n \n\nNotice also that Plantinga's account can also provide truth conditions for\niterated modalities. The problem, recall, was that sentences like \n\nappear to require mere possibilia to serve as the values of the\nquantifier, since no actually existing thing could be a son of the current\npope. For Plantinga, the solution is simply that quantifiers range over\nhaecceities, and that, in particular, (8) is true in virtue of there being\nan unexemplified haecceity h such that (i) in some possible world,\nthe [son of] relation is coexemplified with h and\nRatzinger's haecceity hr and (ii) in another world, that\nvery same haecceity is coexemplified with [being a priest]. \n\nIn sum, then, in Plantinga's account there is a haecceity for\nevery possibile in Kripke's. And for every property that\nevery possibile enjoys at any given world w in Kripke's\naccount, there is an individual essence that is coexemplified with that\nproperty in (the Plantingian counterpart of)\nw. Plantinga's semantics would thus appear to generate precisely\nthe same truth values for the sentences of a modal language as\nKripke's. Hence, it would appear that Plantinga has indeed successfully\ndeveloped a semantics for modal languages that comports with actualist\nscruples.   \n\nJager (1982) has also provided a complete axiomatic system for the above\nformalization of Plantinga's semantics.  To avoid the derivation of\nNE, BF, and CBF, Jager, like Kripke, adopts both the generality\ninterpretation of theorems containing free variables and thus defines his\nsystem without the Rule of Generalization.  Rather, all variables in all\ntheorems are universally quantified.  Additionally, as noted above, and\nfor the same reason, Jager works in a language L* that banishes\nindividual constants so as to avoid the reconstruction of the undesired\nproofs in their terms and hence suffers from the same expressive\nshortcomings noted already in regard to Kripke's axiomatic system\nabove. \n\nFurther, more philosophical objections to Plantinga's account of\nactualism are addressed in the document\n Problems with the Actualist Accounts. \n\nMany propositions are singular in form. That is, as opposed to\ngeneral propositions like [All men are animals] and [There are\nAliens], some propositions are, in the words of Arthur Prior,\n“directly about” specific individuals — for example, the\nproposition [Winston Churchill was a German citizen]. Such\npropositions — often referred to as Russellian propositions\n— are typically expressed by means of sentences involving names,\npronouns, indexicals, or other devices of direct reference. As we've seen,\npossibilists believe that there are singular possibilities (i.e., singular\npropositions that are possibly true) about things that don't actually\nexist, viz., possibilities involving mere possibilia. Similarly,\nhaecceitists also believe there are singular possibilities that are in a\ncertain clear sense directly about things that don't exist, viz.,\npossibilities that, were they actual, would entail the exemplification of\nhaecceities that are, in the actual world, unexemplified.  Say that\na strict actualist is an actualist who rejects the idea that\nthere are, or could be, singular possibilities that are directly about\nthings that do not exist.  Since it is necessary that there are no such\npossibilities, it follows that, had some actually existing\nindividual a failed to exist, there have been no singular\npropositions about that individual; or, as Prior often puts it, there\nwould have been no facts about a, not even the fact\nthat a fails to exist (see, e.g., Prior [1957], pp. 48-49).  A\nstrict actualist, then, as we might put it, believes that, necessarily,\nall possibilities are either wholly general or, at most, are directly\nabout actually existing individuals only. \n\nArthur Prior was the first philosopher to attempt to revise modal logic to\ncomport with strict actualism.  It was Prior [1956] who first proved that\nBF is a theorem of the proof theory of SQML and he clearly saw that the\ntheoremhood of NE required the proponent of SQML to accept either\npossibilism or “the myth that whatever exists exists\nnecessarily” ([1968], p. 48).  Prior's goal, therefore, was to\naddress the possibilist challenge by developing a system of quantified\nmodal logic consistent with both actualism and the existence of contingent\nbeings. \n  \nPrior's solution — his system Q (Prior [1957] Chs. IV and V)\n— has two prongs: rejecting the interdefinability of the modal\noperators □ and ◇; and restricting the Rule of\nNecessitation. The central notion that underlies Prior's system is\nthe notion of necessary statability.  Say first that [φ] is\nthe proposition expressed by a sentence φ, and that φ is true in a\nworld only if the proposition [φ] it expresses is.  Prior's idea\nis that a sentence φ that expresses a singular proposition [φ]\nabout a contingent individual a is not even statable —\nhence neither true nor false — in worlds in which a\ndoesn't exist.  Thus, a sentence φ is necessarily\nstatable only if all of the individuals referred to in the sentence (hence\nall of the individuals the proposition [φ] that it expresses is about)\nare necessary beings.  Prior indicates necessary statability by means of a\nnew operator\n‘S’: the formula ‘Sφ’\nmeans that φ is necessarily statable. \n\nGiven this spadework, Prior argues against the interdefinability of\n□ and ◇ as follows.  Suppose φ expresses a singular\nproposition [φ] about a contingent individual a.  If\nthere is no possible world in which φ is false, then, of course,\nas on any possible world semantics, it is not possible that φ\nitself be false, i.e., ~◇~φ is true.  However, it does not\nfollow that φ is necessarily true, i.e., that □φ is\ntrue.  For in order for that to be the case, φ would have to be\nnecessarily statable.  And for that to be the case, a would\nhave to exist necessarily.  But by hypothesis a is\ncontingent.  Hence, even though we have ~◇~φ, we cannot infer\n□φ.  Accordingly, instead of the usual interdefinability of\n□ and ◇, in Prior's Q we have that a proposition is\nnecessarily true iff it is both necessarily statable and not possibly\nfalse: \n\nA notable consequence of Prior's view is that many logical truths are not\nnecessary.  For example, for any object a, there is obviously no\nworld in which the proposition [Pa→Pa], hence the\nsentence ‘Pa→Pa’, is false.  Thus, if\nφ is a logical truth, it follows that ~◇~φ is also\ntrue (indeed, logically true).  However, if a is a contingent\nbeing, this sentence is unstatable at worlds where a fails to\nexist, and hence is neither true nor false in those worlds.  Hence, it is,\nin particular, not true in those worlds.  So it is not necessarily\ntrue. \n  \nFor Prior, then, we can always infer that a logical truth is not possible\nfalse, that is, he accepts the following rule of inference, which we might\ncall the Rule of Weak Necessitation: \nThus, from \n ⊢(Pa→Pa) \n we have that \n ⊢~◇~(Pa→Pa).  \n Full necessitation, however, requires necessary statability.  Given\n(Q□◇), this can be expressed in the following derived rule: \n Thus, although we have \n ⊢Pa→Pa,\n ⊢□(Pa→Pa) \n does not follow without\n ⊢S(Pa→Pa), \n which is never the case in Q. \n\nAs noted, Prior's chief goal was a quantified modal logic consistent with\nthe existence of contingent beings and that means, first and foremost,\nblocking the derivation of NE.  As in standard predicate logic,\nin Q we have\n ⊢∃y\n y=x, i.e., following DefE! (which, in a\n first-order context, Prior would accept), \n ⊢E!x. \n\nBy RWN, then, we have \n ⊢~◇~E!x\n and, hence, by universal generalization (a\n valid rule in Q), \nThat is, it is a logical theorem of Q that, for any\nobject a, it is not possible that a fail to exist\n— not a happy feature of a purported logic for contingent beings.\nProperly understood, however, Prior argues, the theorem only reflects the\nfact that no proposition about a is statable — even the\nproposition that a doesn't exist — in a world if a\nitself does not.  The theorem in question would be problematic only we\ncould infer ⌈□φ⌉ straightaway,\nwhich is precisely what is prevented by the modifications\nto SQML noted above that are found in Q.  Rather, we get\nonly the weaker, indeed trivial, theorem (SE!a →\n□E!a) that E!a is necessary if it is necessarily\nstatable, i.e., in effect, if a exists necessarily.  Prior\ntherefore claims that our intuitions about possible nonexistence can be\nsalvaged by defining φ to be weakly possible just in case it\nis not necessary, i.e., just in\ncase ⌈~□φ⌉ is true.  Thus, the\nnonexistence of a contingent being a, while not strictly\npossible, is nonetheless weakly possible; more exactly, despite the\ntheoremhood of ‘~◇~E!a’ in Q,\n‘~□E!a’ can be consistently asserted\nin Q.  NE is thus not a theorem of Q.\n(Specifically, Revised RN will not warrant the inference on line 6\nof the\n derivation of NE in SQML.) \n  \nMore generally, it is easy to see that, not only NE,\nbut BF and CBF are not theorems of Prior's logic. The\nproof of BF relied both on the interdefinability of possibility\nand necessity as well as on the unrevised Rule of\nNecessitation. (Specifically, the interdefinability of possibility and\nnecessity plays a crucial role behind the scenes in line 3 of the\nproof of Lemma 1 in the\n derivation of BF in SQML,\n and the Rule of Necessitation was used in the proof of DR1 in line 2\nof the proof of the main Theorem, which is equivalent to BF proper.)\nLikewise, the proof of CBF cannot proceed in the usual way using\nRevised RN. (Specifically, we cannot appeal to Revised RN on\nline 2 of the\n derivation of CBF in SQML.) \n\nObjections to Prior's Q and its philosophical underpinnings are addressed\nin the document\n Problems with the Actualist Accounts. \n\nA notable gap in the foundations of Prior's Q is that it has no clear\nsemantics.  Presumably, modal operators are to be interpreted as\nquantifiers over worlds, but Prior himself never explicitly provides an\naccount of possible worlds nor a formal semantics to provide any insight\ninto what the truth conditions for sentences of Q are supposed to be.\nThis is understandable.  Kripke models are still the norm for modal\nsemantics.  But, as already seen, they appear only to mask commitment to\npossibilia by invalidating NE, BF, and CBF.\nIt is therefore not immediately clear what semantical options remain for\nthe strict actualist. \nBuilding on Prior's metaphysical intuitions, Adams [1981] sketches an\nalternative, strict actualist semantics for modal discourse and a\ncorresponding logic.  As this is arguably the most important and\ninfluential defense and development of strict actualism to his point, I\nwill take particular pains to clarify Adams' arguments and extract and,\nwhere necessary, develop the underlying logic of his account. \nAdams' approach centers around his notion of a “world\nstory”. The intuitive idea is that a world story is a complete\n“description” of things as they could be. Somewhat more\nrigorously, say that a set s of propositions is maximal\nif, for any proposition p, \ns contains either p or its negation ¬p, and that s is\nconsistent if it is possible that all the members of s be\ntrue together. The idea, then, is that a world story is simply a\nmaximal consistent set of propositions. Given this, a proposition\np is true in a world story w just in case p\nis a member of w.  And the actual world story is simply\nthe one such that a proposition p is true in it if and only if\np is, in fact, true.  In particular, then, the truth conditions for\nour paradigmatic modal statement (1), ‘Possibly, there are\nAliens’ (formally, ◇∃xAx), are straightforward\nand, on the face of it, innocuous from a strictly actualist perspective:\n(1) is true if and only if the proposition expressed by ‘There are\nAliens’ is true in some possible world. \nHowever, Adams finds that this simple intuitive idea needs modification in\norder for it properly to reflect strict actualism.  Because there are, in\nfact, no Aliens and since, by hypothesis, no actually existing thing could\nhave been an Alien, it of course follows for the strict actualist that\nthere are, in fact, no singular propositions that are in any sense about\nmerely possible Aliens or “vestiges” of some ilk that play\ntheir role.  For Adams, world stories generally ought to reflect this fact\nabout the actual world story.  That is, as with Prior, a singular\nproposition p about some (actually existing) individual a\nshould be true in a world story w only if the proposition [a\nexists] is also true in w — or, as Prior would put it,\nonly if ‘a exists’ is statable in w.  Thus,\njust as there are in the actual world story no singular propositions about\nindividuals that could have existed but do not, likewise, in no other\nworld story w are there any singular propositions about individuals\nthat would not have existed had w been actual, i.e., if all the\npropositions in w been true.  In general, then, world stories are\nnot fully maximal in the sense above.  Rather, a world story is maximal\nonly with respect to the propositions that would exist if it were\nactual. \nAt first sight, Adams' view seems almost exactly Prior's with the addition\nof world stories and a rather more metaphysically robust conception of\npropositions.  And indeed, as far as the metaphysics goes, this is so.\nBut there are critical differences in the logic that Adams derives from\nthe metaphysics.  Adams' justification for the view (recounted in the previous\nparagraph) that no world w contains singular propositions about\nindividuals a that do not exist in w is very similar to the\nreasoning Prior used to justify his view that no such proposition p\n— notably, the proposition [~E!a] that a does not\nexist — is true with respect to w.  This was\nessentially how Prior justified the logical truth of\n‘~◇~E!a’ and, hence, its theoremhood in his\nlogic Q. \n\nHowever, Adams does not follow Prior here.  Instead, Adams goes on to\nidentify two notions of truth relative to a world story, both of which\ncomport with strict actualism but which yield different sets of logical\ntruths. Notably, the two notions differ on\n‘~◇~E!a’. Specifically, some propositions can be\nconsidered true relative to a world story w in virtue of being\nincluded in w. Intuitively, these are propositions that would have\nhad the property of being true (and hence, by serious actualism, would\nhave existed) if w had been actual. Say that these propositions are\ntrue in w. However, certain singular propositions that are\nnot true in w can clearly be considered true with respect\nto w in another, broader sense. For suppose w is a world\nstory that includes no propositions about Adams. Then, even though\n[Adams does not exist] is not true in w —\nthere would have been no such proposition, after all,\nhad w been actual — we can see, from our perspective\nin the actual world — \n“outside” w looking in, so to speak — that w\nnonetheless represents an Adams-less world; that, in a clear sense,\ndespite its exclusion from w, [Adams does not exist]\ncorrectly describes, or characterizes, w: \nWhen a proposition correctly characterizes a world story w,\nwhether or not it is included in w, Adams says that the\nproposition is true at w.  Every proposition that is\ntrue in w is therefore true at it as well; for if\n[a exists] is not true in w, then [a does not\nexist], and everything it entails, is true at w. \nIn light of this distinction, Prior's Q can be seen to be based\nupon truth in a world while Adams bases his logic upon truth\nat a world.  The difference this makes is quite profound.  Most\nnotably, since propositions of the form [a does not exist] can be\ntrue at a world without being true in it, sentences of the form\n‘~◇~E!a’ do not turn out to be logical truths for\nAdams.  Consequently, Adams is able to restore the equivalence of\n‘□’ and ‘◇’: \n‘~◇~E!a’, in particular, is once again\nlogically equivalent to ‘□E!a’. \nThis is not to say that the system suggested by Adams' approach is\nwithout complications of its own.  Adams only provides a series of\nlogical principles concerning truth at a world and only gestures toward\nthe corresponding axioms.  Nonetheless, it is possible to extract a\nfairly comprehensive logic from those principles (see Menzel [1991]).\nAdams begins by asserting, in effect, the validity of classical\npropositional logic.  Hence, Adams can be understood to be adopting some\ncomplete axiomatization of classical, truth-functional propositional\nlogic.  Adams then broadens his observations about propositions of the\nform [a does not exist] to singular propositions generally.  He\nexpresses this in terms of propositional functions, which for purposes\nhere can be thought of as atomic formulas: \nNote that this principle is essentially \n serious actualism, \n and corresponds directly to the schema \n □SA\n above.  Given universal generalization and Adams' slightly weakened\nversion of necessitation (see below), the only axiom he needs is the\nSA schema: \n\nThe truth of such propositions as [Adams does not exist] at some world\nstory complicates the logic of quantification for Adams.  For, while\n[Adams does not exist] ([~E!a]) might be true at some world\nstory w, it is surely not the case that [Something does not\nexist] ([∃x ~E!x]) is true at w as well.\nMore generally, where φα/τ is the result of\nreplacing all free occurrences of α in φ with occurrences of\nan arbitrary term τ that is substitutable for α in\n φ,[9] \n the necessitation of the law of existential generalization: is not logically valid on Adams' approach. \n□EG is obviously derived in SQML by applying the\nrule of Necessitation to the law of existential generalization.\nAdams' solution is therefore to restrict Necessitation to the\nso-called “free” quantificational fragment of his system.\nMore specifically, where τ is again substitutable for α in\nφ, the usual universal instantiation schema is:  \n To avoid the untoward inference above, Adams adopts the schema:\n \nor, expressed in terms of its existential counterpart:\n \n Thus, applying Necessitation to FEG, then, yields only:\n \nThus, instead of the problematic inference above, from the truth of\n[~E!a] at w, by □FEG, it follows by only that\n[E!a → ∃x~E!x] is true at w.\nSo, where a is Adams, from the truth of [Adams does not exist]\nat w it only follows — trivially, due to its false antecedent\n— that [If Adams exists, then something does not exist] is\ntrue at w.\n \nFull classical quantification theory (in non-modal contexts) can be\nreintroduced into Adams' system (as he desires) simply by adding a\nschema expressing that all names and free variables denote existing\nthings: \nNecessitation is then restricted to the free quantification fragment\nsimply by allowing its application only in proofs not involving any\ninstance of E!:\n \nThe restriction on Nec here prevents the SQML derivation\nof \n BF, \n CBF, and\n NE. \n The proof of BF in particular requires the necessitation of the\nformula ∀x□φ → □φ (see line 2\nin the proof of the main Theorem). But this formula is only derivable\nin Adams' system from the instance\n∀x□φ → (E!x →\n□φ) of FUI together with the instance E!x\nof E!. Hence, the SQML proof of BF cannot be\nreplicated.  The SQML proofs of CBF and NE fail in Adams'\nsystem for similar reasons. \n\nImportantly, serious actualism together with a certain interpretation of\nmodal statements leads Adams [1982, pp. 28ff] to abandon several\nprinciples of basic modal propositional logic. This interpretation is\ncaptured in the following general principle: \n As a special case (where n=0) we have: \nWe can express these principles axiomatically as follows.  Say that a\nformula φ is modal if it is of the\nform ⌈□ψ⌉, \n⌈~□ψ⌉,\n⌈◇ψ⌉\nor ⌈~◇ψ⌉, and that, for a term\nτ, it is de re with respect to τ if it is modal and\ncontains a (free, if τ is a variable) occurrence of τ; then we\nhave: \n\nNote that the effect of MSA is that a modal statement (or existential\nquantification of such) containing a name expresses a modal property de\nre of the individual denoted by the name and hence should be treated\nsemantically, in effect, as an atomic statement, i.e., as a predication\n— hence the evident formal similarity to the serious actualism\nprinciple SA.  Thus, for Adams, ‘Necessarily, Adams is not an\nAlien’, say, expresses, in effect, that Adams has the property of\nbeing such that, necessarily, he is not an Alien; again, ‘Possibly,\nSocrates does not exist’ expresses, in effect, that Socrates has the\nproperty of possibly not existing.  And given this interpretation\nof modal statements of the sort in question this is just what we should\nexpect.  For if they are in effect atomic sentences, i.e., predications of\nmodal properties to objects, it follows that all statements of the sort in\nquestion are false at worlds in which a does not exist.  For by\nserious actualism, an object a can have a property at a world only\nif it exists there.  The principles are thus fully justified on the\ngrounds of serious actualism: \n\nThe logical implications of Adams' understanding of the truth conditions\nfor proposition expressed by de re sentences are dramatic. For if\nthe proposition [Necessarily, Adams is not an Alien] is identical\nor, at least, logically equivalent to the atomic proposition [Adams is\nnecessarily-not-an-Alien], then, while [Necessarily, Adams is not\nan Alien] is in fact true — for at every world, Adams-less or\nnot, [Adams is an Alien] is false — it is not the case that\n[Adams is necessarily-not-an-Alien] is true at worlds in which\nAdams does not exist, since, by serious actualism, Adams has no properties\nat such worlds. Hence, [Necessarily, Adams is\nnecessarily-not-an-Alien] is false simpliciter.  Since\n[Adams is necessarily-not-an-Alien] is at least logically\nequivalent to [Necessarily, Adams is not an Alien], their\nnecessitations are logically equivalent as well.  Hence, [Necessarily,\nnecessarily, Adams is not an Alien], too, is false. Thus, we have\n‘□~Aa’ and\n‘~□□~Aa’, i.e.,\n‘~(□~Aa → □□~Aa)’,\ni.e., the characteristic principle \n\nof the modal propositional logic S4 is, in general, invalid. \n\nBy the same token we lose the characteristic principle of the logic\nS5.  For the proposition [Possibly, Socrates exists] is\nobviously true.  However, according to the Adams, this is at least\nlogically equivalent to the atomic proposition [Socrates\npossibly-exists].  So by serious actualism again, it is not true in\nworlds where Socrates does not exist.  Hence, [Necessarily, Socrates\npossibly-exists] is false simpliciter.  But [Socrates\npossibly-exists] is, at least, logically equivalent to the\nproposition [Possibly, Socrates exists], so their necessitations\nare equivalent as well.  Hence, [Necessarily, possibly, Socrates\nexists] is false.  Thus, we have ◇E!s and\n~□◇E!s, i.e., ~(◇E!s →\n□◇E!s), i.e., the characteristic principle \nof S5 is also, in general, \ninvalid.[15] \nAs a consequence, Adams follows Prior in rejecting the usual logical\nequivalence of necessity and possibility albeit, for Adams, only in modal\ncontexts rather than across the board.  For in denying that Adams is\nnecessarily not an Alien at an Adams-less world u, i.e., in\naffirming the truth of [~□~Aa], at u, it does not\nfollow that he is possibly an Alien, i.e., it does not follow for Adams\nthat [◇Aa] is true at u. Indeed, on Adams' semantics\nfor modal propositions at worlds once again, its negation\n[~◇Aa] is true at u.  In place of the modal schema\n4, therefore, Adams proposes a weaker principle that, in modal\ncontexts, reflects the notion of weak necessity reflected in\nPrior's principle RWN above; specifically: \nSimilarly, in denying that Socrates' existence is possible at a world\nw in which he doesn't exist, i.e., in affirming the truth of\n[~◇E!s] at w, it does not follow that his\nnon-existence is necessary at w, i.e., it does not follow that\n[□~E!s] is true at w. Indeed, as just noted, on\nAdams' semantics for modal propositions at worlds, it is false outright at\nw since [□~E!s] is true there if and only if, at\nw, Socrates has the property of necessarily-not-existing. Thus,\n[~□~E!s] is true at w.  In place of the 5\nschema, therefore, Adams proposes the following weaker principle that, in\nmodal contexts, reflects Prior's notion of weak possibility: \n  Weakening 4 and 5 to W4 and W5,\n  respectively, forces a final repair.  Specifically, if □◇ is considered a logical\n  axiom, then 4 and 5 are immediately derivable from\n  W4 and W5 by Nec.  But the solution is\n  straightforward and requires a weakening of □◇ along\n  Priorean lines, albeit one that, unlike Q□◇, preserves\n  the logical truth of □◇.  Consider the following\n  definition: \n  Then □◇ simply needs to be weakened to \n  Unlike Q□◇, A□◇ does not require that\n  the individual constituents of the proposition [φ] themselves exist\n  necessarily in order for the necessity of [φ] to follow from the\n  impossibility of [~φ].  Rather, it requires only that, for any given\n  world w, those constituents exist simpliciter, so that\n  [φ] can be evaluated, from the perspective of w, with respect\n  to any world u, regardless of whether or not its constituents\n  exist in u.  Given the restriction on Nec, it is not\n  possible to derive the necessitation of □◇ from\n  A□◇ and that prevents the derivation of 4 and\n  5 from W4 and W5.  Given E!, however,\n  □◇ still falls out as a theorem. \n\nObjections to Adams' world story semantics are discussed in the\ndocument\n Problems with the Actualist Accounts. \n\nMcMichael [1983a] has proposed an actualist semantics that avoids\ncertain\n objections to haecceities \nas well as certain  \n objections to world stories.\n Like Plantinga, McMichael introduces a class of\nproperties, which he calls roles, that serve as surrogates of a\nsort for possibilia. Importantly, however, unlike haecceities,\nroles are all purely qualitative, except perhaps insofar as they involve\nactually existing individuals, and are not in general assumed to be\nessential, or essentially unique to, any given individual. As such, they\ncannot play the vestigial role that either unexemplified haecceities play\nin Plantinga's actualism or that possibly\nconcrete nonconcretia play in new actualism. \nMcMichael's account builds on a very rich and elaborate theory\nof n-place relations, and it is necessary to lay out at least\nsome of its basic concepts in order to understand the account.  First,\nsome terminology.  In general, the arity of a relation is the\nnumber of places it has, that is, the number of arguments it takes to\nform a proposition.  Thus, [being happy] is a 1-place relation\nand therefore has arity 1, while [being between] has arity 3.\nNote that, for McMichael, the term ‘relation’ encompasses\nboth properties and propositions: properties are 1-place, or unary,\nrelations and propositions are 0-place relations. \nInstead of necessity and possibility, McMichael's primitive modal\nnotion is inclusion, a 2-place relation that can hold between\nrelations of the same or different arity.  Because it is McMichael's\nonly modal primitive, inclusion cannot be defined, but, intuitively,\nin the case of properties, the idea is that one property P\nincludes another\nQ just in case, necessarily, anything that has\nP has Q.  Thus, the property [being red] includes the\nproperty [being colored]. Again, intutively once again, one binary\nrelation\nR includes another R′ just in\ncase, necessarily, for any objects x and\ny, if x bears R to\ny, then x bears\nR′ to y.  So, for example, the conjunctive relation\n[being both a child and an heir of] includes the relation [being\na child of]. \n\nInclusion can also hold between an n+1-place relation and\nan n-place relation, relative to one of the argument places\nof the \n former.[10]\n Thus, in particular, a 2-place relation\nQ can include a property P, relative\nto one of its two argument places: intuitively, Q\nincludes P, relative to its first argument place, if\nand only if, necessarily, whenever two things a and\nb stand in the relation Q,\na exemplifies P. And if the inclusion\nwere with respect to the second argument place, of course, it would be\nb that exemplifies P. So, for example, the relation\n[brother of], relative to its first argument place, includes the\nproperty [being male]; whenever any object a bears the\n[brother-of] relation to some object b,\na has the property [being male]. Again, [brother-of],\nrelative to its second argument place, includes the property [being a\nsibling]. \n\nA (unary) role is just a “purely qualitative” property of a\ncertain sort, where (as described in more detail in the supplementary\ndocument on\n Qualitative Essences)\n a purely qualitative property is a property that\n“involves” no particular individuals. Thus, such\nproperties as [being a philosopher] and [being someone's\nmother or maternal aunt] are purely qualitative, while [being a\nstudent of Quine] and [being Johnson's mother or a friend of\nBoswell] are not.  Given this, McMichael defines a\nproperty P to be a unary role if (i) it is\nexemplifiable, (ii) it is purely qualitative, and (iii) for any purely\nqualitative property Q, either P includes\nQ or P includes the complement ~Q\nof Q. A role is thus a complete (nonmodal)\n“characterization” of the way something could be,\nqualitatively.  Intuitively, then, the role @(a) of a given\nobject a is a “conjunction” of all of the purely\nqualitative, nonconjunctive properties that a\nexemplifies. Thus, for example, Socrates' role @(Socrates) includes\nthe properties [being a philosopher], [being\nsnub-nosed], [being the most famous teacher of a famous\nphilosopher], [being condemned to death] and so\n on.[11] \n The notion of role generalizes in a natural way to\nall n-place relations, including, notably, propositions\n(i.e., 0-place relations) and binary (i.e., 2-place) relations. A\n0-place role is simply McMichael's version of a possible\nworld. Similar to Adams' world stories, a 0-place role is a\nconjunction of purely qualitative propositions that is both maximal\n(with regard to purely qualitative propositions) and possible:\npossible world w is a conjunction of purely qualitative\npropositions such that, for any qualitative\nproposition P, w includes either P or its\ncomplement, but not both. Thus, the actual world in particular is the\nconjunction of all true qualitative propositions. Similarly, the\nbinary role @(Boswell,Johnson) that Boswell bears to Johnson is,\nintuitively, a conjunction of all of the purely qualitative,\nnonconjunctive binary relations that Boswell bears to\n Johnson.[12] \n As one might suspect, it can be shown on McMichael's theory that a binary\nrole includes a unique unary role with respect to each of its argument\nplaces.  In particular, the binary role @(Boswell,Johnson) includes\n@(Boswell) relative to its first argument place and @(Johnson)\nrelative to its second.  \n\nImportantly, McMichael also introduces a notion of accessibility\nbetween roles to capture intuitions about possibility, notably, de\nre possibility. To see how this notion works into McMichael's\naccount, note that Adams [1979] has argued persuasively that no purely\nqualitative property, no matter how complex, can serve as an individual\nessence for a contingent being. (This point is also discussed in the\nsupplementary document on \n Qualitative Essences.) \n Hence, in general, roles — being purely qualitative\n— are not individual essences. Rather, they are general properties\nthat are (in general) exemplifiable by different things (though not\nnecessarily things in the same possible world). Because of this, none of\nthe objections to Plantinga's haecceities is relevant to roles, as the\nfact that haecceities are individual essences lies at the heart of those\nobjections. At the same time, McMichael is able to provide a semantics for\n(8) — ◇∃x(Sxp ∧ ◇Px) — that does not run afoul of the iterated modalities objection. The\nbasic trick is to “alter the criterion for deciding what an individual\nmight have done” [Ibid., 73]: \n\nThus, a little more formally, where F is the property\n[being foolish], and s is Socrates, a simple\nmodal sentence such as \n\nis true just in case some unary role accessible to the actual role\nof Socrates includes the property of being foolish.  Naturally enough,\nMcMichael takes accessibility to be transitive — intuitively, if\nSocrates could have played a role R1 other than his actual role\n@(Socrates) and, had he played that role, he could have played another\nrole R2, then R2 is in fact a role he could have played, i.e., R2 should\nbe considered accessible to @(Socrates). \n\nSimilar to Plantinga's semantics, then, quantifiers do not range\nover individuals, but over roles. This enables McMichael to avoid the\niterated modalities objection and, in particular, to provide a\ncompositional semantics for our iterative paradigm (8). Specifically, (8)\nis true if and only if \n\n(10) captures the idea that an individual such as Ratzinger could\nhave been a parent. Adams, of course, got this far in his account of\n(8). But,  unlike Adams,\n with roles at his disposal, McMichael can continue his analysis of (8) and\nunpack the existentially quantified formula\n‘∃xCxy’. Specifically, (10) holds if and only\nif \n\nThat is, in accordance with McMichael's recursive definition of truth,\n(11) unpacks the quantified formula ‘∃xCxy’\nin terms of the [child of] relation that is expressed by the\nembedded atomic formula ‘Cxy’. Specifically, the\ntruth of (8) consists in the existence of a binary role s that\nincludes the [child of] relation and, relative to its second\nargument place, a role accessible to Ratzinger's\nrole Rr. Note that, being a binary role,\ns also includes a unique role relative to its first\nargument place. And because it includes the [child of]\nrelation and, relative to its second argument place, a role\nR accessible to Ratzinger's role\nRr, s will include,\nrelative to its first argument place, a role R′\nthat can only be exemplified by a child of whatever exemplifies\nR, i.e., a child of such an object as\nRatzinger. \n\nTo capture the intuition that no such child could be identical to any\nactually existing thing, then, McMichael can simply deny that the\nrole R′ that would be exemplified by such a child is\naccessible to the role of any actually existing thing. \n\nImportantly, accessibility between roles is also the mechanism McMichael\nuses to account for possible nonexistence. Specifically, if a unary\nrole R1 is accessible to a binary\nrole R2 then McMichael takes this intuitively (and\nensures it formally) to mean that, if @(a,b)\n= R2, then it is possible that a exist and\nexemplify R1 without b\n existing.[13]\n Similarly, to say simply that it is possible that a given individual\n— Socrates say — fail to exist is, on McMichael's\nsemantics, to say that some possible world (i.e., some 0-place role) is\naccessible to @(Socrates).  As McMichael [Ibid., p. 78] puts it: \n\nAll of the controversial consequences of SQML are invalid in\nMcMichael's role semantics. BF, in particular, fails because the\nsemantics allows for interpretations in which the domain of actual\nindividuals is empty but the domains of other worlds are not. In such\ninterpretations, ◇∃xE!x is true but\n∃◇xE!x is not. (Obviously, NE fails in such\ninterpretations as well.) \n\nUnlike Adams' account, the characteristic S4 schema is valid due\nto the transitivity of the accessibility relation among roles.  However,\nthe Brouwerian schema,  \n\nand hence also the 5 schema (which follows from the\nsystem S4 + B) are not valid.  The technical details of this\nare complex, but the intuitive reason why B fails in McMichael's\nsemantics is similar to Adams' reasons for the failure of the 5\nschema. As with Adams, in McMichael's account, for Socrates' existence to\nbe possible at a world is for him to have the property of possibly not\nexisting. Hence, in worlds in which Socrates does not exist (i.e., worlds\naccessible from his actual role @(Socrates)), there is no such thing as\nSocrates to exemplify any properties, in particular the property of\npossibly existing. Hence, by serious actualism, in worlds in which he\ndoesn't exist, Socrates does not have the property of possibly\nexisting. Hence, as with Adams, it is true, but not necessary, that\nSocrates' existence is possible, i.e., we have ◇E!s but not\n□◇E!s. \n\nFor similar reasons, τ=τ is not logically necessary for McMichael\nfor terms τ generally. For identity is a relation and hence, by\nserious actualism, in worlds in which Socrates, say, does not exist,\nSocrates stands in no relations to anything, himself in particular. Thus,\nwhen s is Socrates, □s=s is not true. \n\nObjections to McMichael's role theory are addressed in the\n document\n Problems with the Actualist Accounts. \n\nA rather different strict actualist approach to the possibilist challenge\nis broached by Menzel [1990] and is clarified and refined by Ray [1995].\nA very similar approach is elaborated in great formal and philosophical\ndetail by Chihara [1998]. For ease of reference, call this approach\n“model-theoretic actualism”. \n\nAll non-skeptical approaches to modality agree that Kripke models provide\nkey insights into the meaning of our modal discourse and the nature of\nmodal reality. However, as we have seen, the naive “intended”\nmodel of Kripke semantics leads to possibilism. As seen above, the\nstandard sort actualist response — what David Lewis calls\n“ersatzism” — has been to define actualistically acceptable notions\nof possible worlds or possible individuals to serve as replacements for\nthe elements of\nw and D in the naive intended model,\nthereby (or so it is argued) preserving the semantical and metaphysical\nbenefits of Kripke models while avoiding ontological commitment to\npossibilia. As just seen above, however, ersatzism is still\nproblematic. By contrast, the model-theoretic account does not attempt to\nidentify worlds and possibilia as acceptable abstract entities of\nsome sort. Rather, these notions are abandoned altogether. \n\nTo get at the idea, note first that the notion of an intended Tarski\nmodel makes perfectly good sense for a formalization of nonmodal\ndiscourse about the actual world. To illustrate, suppose we have a\ngiven a piece of nonmodal discourse about a certain event, a baseball\ngame, say. Suppose now we formalize that discourse in a nonmodal\nlanguage L′; that is, for each referring expression in\nthe disourse (e.g., ‘Mark McGwire’, ‘second\ninning’, etc.), there is a unique constant of L′,\nand for every simple verb phrase in the discourse (‘is a home\nrun’, ‘is out’, ‘relieves’, etc.) there\nis a unique predicate of L′. Then we can form a Tarski\nmodel ML′ for\nL′ whose domain consists of the actual objects that the\nspeakers are talking about in the discourse (fans, players, equipment,\netc.) and which interprets the predicates of L′ so that\nthey are true of exactly those (n-tuples of objects in the\ndomain that are in the extension of the corresponding verb phrases of\nthe discourse. In this way we form the intended model of\nL′, the piece of the world that it is intended to be\nabout. \n\nAccording to proponents of model-theoretic actualism, the fallacy of both\nersatzism and possibilism is the inference that things must work in\nlargely the same way with regard to Kripke models. A Kripke model is\nbasically an indexed collection of Tarski models. Just as there is an\nintended Tarski model for a nonmodal language L′\nconstructed from the actual world, the accounts above infer that, for a\ngiven formalization L of modal discourse, there must be an\nintended Kripke model constructed from all possible worlds. And, depending\non one's tolerance for possibilia, this leads either to possibilism or one\nof its ersatz variations. \n\nFor model-theoretic actualists, the modal upshot of a Kripke model, what\nit tells us about modal reality, is found in\nits structure rather than its specific content. The elements of a Kripke\nmodel are therefore irrelevant; it is\neasiest just to take them all to be pure sets, or ordinal numbers, \nor some\nother type of familiar mathematical object. Consequently, there can be no\nnotion of a single intended model, because, for every model, there are\ninfinitely many others that are structurally isomorphic to it and, as noted,\nstructure is all that matters on the model-theoretic account. In place of\nintended models, the model-theoretic account offers the notion of an\nintended* model. To get at the idea, suppose one has an\nintended Tarski model M of the actual world, a model\nthat actually contains entities in the world and assigns extensions to\npredicates that reflect the actual meanings of the adjectives and verb\nphrases those predicates formalize. Now replace the objects in that\nmodel with abstract objects of some ilk to obtain a new model\nM′ that is structurally isomorphic to\nM. Then M′ also models the\nworld under a mapping, or embedding, that takes each element\ne′ of M′ to the element\ne that it replaced in M. We can thus\njustifiably think of M′ as a sort of intended\nmodel because, even though it doesn't necessary contain\nanything but pure sets (or some other type of mathematical object),\nunder an appropriate embedding it models the actual world no less than\nM. To distinguish models like\nM′ that require a nontrivial embedding into the world from\nmodels like M, model-theoretic actualists call the former\nintended* models. \n\nAccording to model-theoretic actualism, the notion of an intended* Tarski\nmodel is all that is needed for modeling the modal facts. From these, a\nnotion of an intended* Kripke model can be defined. Assume that\nL is a model language that formalizes some range of\nmodal discourse about the world. Roughly, then, an intended* Kripke\nmodel M is simply a Kripke model such that (i) the\nTarski model indexed by the distinguished index\nw0 is an intended* Tarski model of the\nactual world, (ii) every Tarski model M in\nM could have been an intended* model of the\nworld, that is, the world could have been as M\nrepresents it, and (iii) necessarily, some Tarski model in\nM is an intended* model of the world, i.e., no matter how\nthe world had been, there would have been an intended* Tarski model of it\nin\n M.[14] \n\nTruth in a model on the model-theoretic account is defined as usual as\ntruth at the distinguish index w0 of the model, hence, a\nsentence φ is true simpliciter if and only if it is true at the\ndistinguished index of some (hence, any) intended* Kripke model. Given the\ndefinition of an intended* model, it follows that a modal formula\n‘◇φ’ is true if and only if, for some intended*\nKripke-model M, φ is true in some Tarski-model M\nin M, that is, in some Tarski-model M\nin M that could have been an intended* model of the\nworld. Thus, in particular, (1) is true if and only if \n\nthat is, given the definition of an intended* Kripke model, if and only if\nthere is a Tarski model M that could have been an intended* Tarski\nmodel and such that, if it had been, there would have been aliens. \n\nAccording to model-theoretic actualism, then, intended* Kripke models\nadequately represent the modal structure of the world simply by virtue of\ntheir own modal properties. And because the only Kripke models that are needed \nfor providing\na semantics for modal languages are constructed entirely\nout of existing objects, Kripke's semantics\nconforms with the thesis of actualism, but does so without the elaborate\nmetaphysical apparatus of the ersatzist accounts. \n\nThat said, certain refinements to Kripke models are introduced by\nmodel-theoretic actualists to deliver a more appealing quantified\nmodal logic than Kripke's.  First, to comport with serious actualism\n(and to validate SA as a logical truth) the extension of a predicate\nat a world is restricted to the domain of the world.  As in Kripke\nmodels, the domain of a “world” can be empty, with the\nexception of the actual world, and quantified sentences are evaluated\nat a world relative to the domain of that world.  Obviously, at any\nsuch world w, ∀x~E!x (as well as any\nother universally quantified sentence) will be vacuously true.\nEqually obviously, ~E!a will be true, no matter the value of\n‘a’.  Thus, the principle of universal\ninstantiation UI is not necessary.  It is therefore important\nfor the model-theoretic actualist to use the “free“\nquantification axiom FUI of Adams' logic.  Also, as in both\nPrior's Q and Adams' logic, it is assumed that all terms\ndenote actually existing things; this is reflected model theoretically\nin the condition that terms are assigned denotations in the domain of\nthe actual world.  Hence the principle E! is valid as well.\nGiven this, the model-theoretic actualists adopt the free\nquantification theory of Adams' logic, which, as noted, in the\npresence of E! yields a classical quantification theory in\nnonmodal contexts.  Both E! and UI is therefore\nlogically valid but contingent for the model-theoretic actualist.  To\navoid their derivation, as in Adams' logic, the rule of necessitation\nis restricted to theorems that are provable without any instance\nof E!. \n\nModel-theoretic actualists differ dramatically with Adams on the\nunderlying propositional base of modal logic.  However, this is not the\nresult of any philosophical or theoretical differences between these two\ntypes of actualism.  As noted\nabove, Adams takes any modal statement containing a name as, in\neffect, an atomic statement that predicates a modal property of the\nreferent of the name.  This leads him to reject the characteristic axiom\nschemas of both S4 and S5.  For model-theoretic actualists\n— those on which the present account is based, at any rate —\nthis is a move that Adams did not have to make.  Specifically,\nmodel-theoretic actualists reject the principle MSA that treats\nde re sentences as, in effect, predications.  Rather, a\nconsistent application of the intuition underlying the truth-in/truth-at\ndistinction suggests that the truth conditions for modal propositions at\nother worlds — their “modal facts” — are\ndetermined from the perspective of the actual world.  More carefully put\nin terms of model-theoretic actualism, the truth value of a de re\nsentence at a Tarski model within an intended* Kripke model\nM is evaluated from the perspective of the\n“actual” world @ of M.  Notably,\nsuppose M is a Tarski model in M representing\nthings as they might have been if Socrates hadn't existed.  For the\nmodel-theoretic actualist, the statement that it is possible that Socrates\nexists, ◇E!s, is evaluated straightaway as true at M\njust in case there is a Tarski model M in M at\nwhich E!s is true — the “actual” model\nM@ indexed by @, for instance.  Thus, informally\nspeaking once again, it is from “our” perspective in the\nactual world that we see that Socrates exists and hence deem it as\npossible with respect to any other world, Socrates-less or not.  Hence,\n◇E!s → □◇E!s — and indeed, by\nsimilar reasoning, any instance of the S4 and S5 schemas\n— is valid for the model-theoretic actualist. \n\nBy removing MSA and restoring S5 to the reconstruction of\nAdams' above, the model-theoretic actualist arrives at a much more\nstandard first-order modal logic without, it would appear, any commitment\nto possibilia or possible worlds.  The resulting logic is proved\ncomplete in Menzel [1991]. \n\nObjections to model-theoretic actualism are addressed in the document\n Problems with the Actualist Accounts.","contact.mail":"cmenzel@tamu.edu","contact.domain":"tamu.edu"}]
