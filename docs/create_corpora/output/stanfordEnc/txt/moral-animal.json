Providing an\nanswer to this question has become increasingly important among\nphilosophers as well as those outside of philosophy who are interested\nin our treatment of non-human animals. For some, answering this\nquestion will enable us to better understand the nature of human\nbeings and the proper scope of our moral obligations. Some argue that\nthere is an answer that can distinguish humans from the rest of the\nnatural world. Many of those who accept this answer are interested in\njustifying certain human practices towards non-humans—practices\nthat cause pain, discomfort, suffering and death. This latter group\nexpects that in answering the question in a particular way, humans\nwill be justified in granting moral consideration to other humans that\nis neither required nor justified when considering non-human animals.\nIn contrast to this view, an increasing number of philosophers have\nargued that while humans are different in a variety of ways from each\nother and other animals, these differences do not provide a\nphilosophical defense for denying non-human animals moral\nconsideration. What the basis of moral consideration is and what it\namounts to has been the source of much disagreement.\n\nTo say that a being deserves moral consideration is to say that there\nis a moral claim that this being can make on those who can recognize\nsuch claims. A morally considerable being is a being who can be\nwronged. It is often thought that because only humans can recognize\nmoral claims, it is only humans who are morally considerable. However,\nwhen we ask why we think humans are the only types of beings that can\nbe morally wronged, we begin to see that the class of beings able to\nrecognize moral claims and the class of beings who can suffer moral\nwrongs are not co-extensive. \nThe view that only humans are morally considered is sometimes referred\nto as “speciesism”. In the 1970s, Richard Ryder coined\nthis term while campaigning in Oxford to denote a ubiquitous type of human centered prejudice, which he\nthought was similar to racism. He objected to favoring one’s own\nspecies, while exploiting or harming members of other species. Peter\nSinger popularized the term and focused on the way speciesism, without\nmoral justification, favors the interests of humans:  \nthe racist violates the principle of equality by giving greater weight\nto the interests of members of his own race, when there is a clash\nbetween their interests and the interests of those of another race.\nSimilarly the speciesist allows the interests of his own species to\noverride the greater interests of members of other species. The\npattern is the same in each case. (Singer 1974: 108)  \nDiscrimination based on race, like discrimination based on species is\nthought to be prejudicial, because these are not characteristics that\nmatter when it comes to making moral claims. \nSpeciesist actions and attitudes are prejudicial because there is no\nprima facie reason for preferring the interests of beings\nbelonging to the species group to which one also belongs over the\ninterests of those who don’t. That humans are members of the\nspecies Homo sapiens is certainly a distinguishing feature of\nhumans—humans share a genetic make-up and a distinctive\nphysiology, we all emerge from a human pregnancy, but this is\nunimportant from the moral point of view. Species membership is a\nmorally irrelevant characteristic, a bit of luck that is no more\nmorally interesting than being born in Malaysia or Canada. As a\nmorally irrelevant characteristic it cannot serve as the basis for a\nview that holds that our species deserves moral consideration that is\nnot owed to members of other species. \nOne might respond that it is not membership in a biological category\nthat matters morally, but rather the social meaning of those\ncategories, meanings that structure not only the institutions we\noperate within, but how we conceptualize ourselves and our world.\nHumans have developed moral systems as well as a wide range of other\nvaluable practices, and by creating these systems, we separate the\nhuman from the rest of the animal kingdom. But the category\n“human” itself is morally contested. Some argue, for\nexample, that racism is not simply, or even primarily about\ndiscrimination and prejudice, but rather a mechanism of dehumanizing\nblackness so as to provide the conditions that makes humans white (see\nFanon 1967; Kim 2015; Ko& Ko 2017). According\nto this line of thought, speciesism isn’t focused on\ndiscrimination or prejudice but is a central tool for creating human\n(and white) supremacy or exceptionalism. \nLike speciesism, human exceptionalism can be understood in different\nways. The most common way of understanding it is to suggest that there\nare distinctly human capacities and it is on the basis of these\ncapacities that humans have moral status and other animals do not. But\nwhich capacities mark out all and only humans as the kinds of beings\nthat can be wronged? A number of candidate capacities have been\nproposed—developing family ties, solving social problems,\nexpressing emotions, starting wars, having sex for pleasure, using\nlanguage, or thinking abstractly, are just a few. As it turns out,\nnone of these activities is uncontroversially unique to human. Both\nscholarly and popular work on animal behavior suggests that many of\nthe activities that are thought to be distinct to humans occurs in\nnon-humans. For example, many species of non-humans develop long\nlasting kinship ties—orangutan mothers stay with their young for\neight to ten years and while they eventually part company, they\ncontinue to maintain their relationships. Less solitary animals, such\nas chimpanzees, baboons, wolves, and elephants maintain extended\nfamily units built upon complex individual relationships, for long\nperiods of time. Meerkats in the Kalahari desert are known to\nsacrifice their own safety by staying with sick or injured family\nmembers so that the fatally ill will not die alone. All animals living\nin socially complex groups must solve various problems that inevitably\narise in such groups. Canids and primates are particularly adept at\nit, yet even chickens and horses are known to recognize large numbers\nof individuals in their social hierarchies and to maneuver within\nthem. One of the ways that non-human animals negotiate their social\nenvironments is by being particularly attentive to the emotional\nstates of others around them. When a conspecific is angry, it is a\ngood idea to get out of his way. Animals that develop life-long bonds\nare known to suffer from the death of their partners. Some are even\nsaid to die of sorrow. Darwin reported this in The Descent of\nMan: “So intense is the grief of female monkeys for the\nloss of their young, that it invariably caused the death of certain\nkinds” (1871: 40). Jane Goodall’s report of the death of\nthe healthy 8 year old chimpanzee Flint just three weeks after the\ndeath of his mother Flo also suggests that sorrow can have a\ndevastating effect on non-human animals (see Goodall 2000:\n140–141 in Bekoff 2000). Coyotes, elephants and killer whales\nare also among the species for which profound effects of grief have\nbeen reported (Bekoff 2000) and many dog owners can provide similar\naccounts. While the lives of many, perhaps most, non-humans in the\nwild are consumed with struggle for survival, aggression and battle,\nthere are some non-humans whose lives are characterized by expressions\nof joy, playfulness, and a great deal of sex (Woods 2010). Recent\nstudies in cognitive ethology have suggested that some non-humans\nengage in manipulative and deceptive activity, can construct\n“cognitive maps” for navigation, and some non-humans\nappear to understand symbolic representation and are able to use\n language.[1] \nIt appears that most of the capacities that are thought to distinguish\nhumans as morally considerable beings, have been observed, often in\nless elaborate form, in the non-human world. Because human behavior\nand cognition share deep roots with the behavior and cognition of\nother animals, approaches that try to find sharp behavioral or\ncognitive boundaries between humans and other animals remain\ncontroversial. For this reason, attempts to establish human uniqueness\nby identifying certain capacities, are not the most promising when it\ncomes to thinking hard about the moral status of animals. \nNonetheless, there is something important that is thought to\ndistinguish humans from non-humans that is not reducible to the\nobservation of behavior best explained by possessing a certain\ncapacity and that is our “personhood”. The notion of\npersonhood identifies a category of morally considerable beings that\nis thought to be coextensive with humanity. Historically, Kant is the\nmost noted defender of personhood as the quality that makes a being\nvaluable and thus morally considerable (for a contemporary utilitarian\ndiscussion of personhood, see Varner 2012).  Kant writes: \n…every rational being, exists as an end in himself and not\nmerely as a means to be arbitrarily used by this or that\nwill…Beings whose existence depends not on our will but on\nnature have, nevertheless, if they are not rational beings, only a\nrelative value as means and are therefore called things. On the other\nhand, rational beings are called persons inasmuch as their nature\nalready marks them out as ends in themselves. (Kant [1785] 1998: [Ak\n4: 428]) \nAnd: \nThe fact that the human being can have the representation\n“I” raises him infinitely above all the other beings on\nearth. By this he is a person….that is, a being altogether\ndifferent in rank and dignity from things, such as irrational animals,\nwith which one may deal and dispose at one’s discretion. (Kant\n[1798] 2010: 239 [Ak 7: 127]) \nMore recent work in a Kantian vein develops this idea. Christine\nKorsgaard, for example, argues that humans “uniquely” face\na problem, the problem of normativity. This problem emerges because of\nthe reflective structure of human consciousness. We can, and often do,\nthink about our desires and ask ourselves “Are these desires\nreasons for action? Do these impulses represent the kind of things I\nwant to act according to?” Our reflective capacities allow us\nand require us to step back from our mere impulses in order\nto determine when and whether to act on them. In stepping back we gain\na certain distance from which we can answer these questions and solve\nthe problem of normativity. We decide whether to treat our desires as\nreasons for action based on our conceptions of ourselves, on our\n“practical identities”. When we determine whether we\nshould take a particular desire as a reason to act we are engaging in\na further level of reflection, a level that requires an endorseable\ndescription of ourselves. This endorseable description of ourselves,\nthis practical identity, is a necessary moral identity because without\nit we cannot view our lives as worth living or our actions as worth\ndoing. Korsgaard suggests that humans face the problem of normativity\nin a way that non-humans apparently do not: \nA lower animal’s attention is fixed on the world. Its\nperceptions are its beliefs and its desires are its will. It is\nengaged in conscious activities, but it is not conscious of\nthem. That is, they are not the objects of its attention. But we human\nanimals turn our attention on to our perceptions and desires\nthemselves, on to our own mental activities, and we are conscious\nof them. That is why we can think about\nthem…And this sets us a problem that no other animal has. It is\nthe problem of the normative…. The reflective mind cannot\nsettle for perception and desire, not just as such. It needs a reason.\n(Korsgaard 1996: 93) \nHere, Korsgaard understands “reason” as “a kind of\nreflective success” and given that non-humans are thought to be\nunable to reflect in a way that would allow them this sort of success,\nit appears that they do not act on reasons, at least reasons of this\nkind. Since non-humans do not act on reasons they do not have a\npractical identity from which they reflect and for which they act. So\nhumans can be distinguished from non-humans because humans, we might\nsay, are sources of normativity and non-humans are not. \nBut arguably, Kant’s view of personhood does not distinguish all\nand only humans as morally considerable. Personhood is not, in fact,\ncoextensive with humanity when understood as a general description of\nthe group to which human beings belong. And the serious part of this\nproblem is not that there may be some extra-terrestrials or deities\nwho have rational capacities. The serious problem is that many humans\nare not persons. Some humans—i.e., infants, children, people in\ncomas—do not have the rational, self-reflective capacities\nassociated with personhood. This problem, unfortunately known in the\nliterature as the problem of “marginal cases”, poses\nserious difficulties for “personhood” as the criterion of\nmoral considerability. Many beings whose positive moral value we have\ndeeply held intuitions about, and who we treat as morally\nconsiderable, will be excluded from consideration by this account. \nThere are three ways to respond to this counter-intuitive conclusion.\nOne, which can be derived from one interpretation of Kant, is to\nsuggest that non-persons are morally considerable indirectly. Though\nKant believed that animals were mere things it appears he did not\ngenuinely believe we could dispose of them any way we wanted. In the\nLectures on Ethics he makes it clear that we have indirect\nduties to animals, duties that are not toward them, but in regard to\nthem insofar as our treatment of them can affect our duties to\npersons. \nIf a man shoots his dog because the animal is no longer capable of\nservice, he does not fail in his duty to the dog, for the dog cannot\njudge, but his act is inhuman and damages in himself that humanity\nwhich it is his duty to show towards mankind. If he is not to stifle\nhis human feelings, he must practice kindness towards animals, for he\nwho is cruel to animals becomes hard also in his dealings with men.\n([1784–5] 1997: 212 [Ak 27: 459]) \nAnd one could argue the same would be true of those human beings who\nare not persons. We disrespect our humanity when we act in inhumane\nways towards non-persons, whatever their species. \nBut this indirect view is unsatisfying—it fails to capture the\nindependent wrong that is being done to the non-person. When someone\nrapes a woman in a coma, or whips a severely brain damaged child, or\nsets a cat on fire, they are not simply disrespecting humanity or\nthemselves as representatives of it, they are wronging these\nnon-persons. So, a second way to avoid the counter-intuitive\nconclusion is to argue that such non-persons stand in the proper\nrelations to “rational nature” such that they should be\nthought of as morally considerable. Allen Wood (1998) argues in this\nway and suggests that all beings that potentially have a rational\nnature, or who virtually have it, or who have had it, or who have part\nof it, or who have the necessary conditions of it, what he calls\n“the infrastructure of rational nature”, should be\ndirectly morally considerable. Insofar as a being stands in this\nrelation to rational nature, they are the kinds of beings that can be\nwronged. \nThis response is not unlike that of noted animal rights proponent, Tom\nRegan, who argues that what is important for moral consideration are\nnot the differences between humans and non-humans but the\nsimilarities. Regan argues that because persons share with certain\nnon-persons (which includes those humans and non-humans who have a\ncertain level of organized cognitive function) the ability to be\nexperiencing subject of a life and to have an individual welfare that\nmatters to them regardless of what others might think, both deserve\nmoral consideration. Regan argues that subjects of a life: \nwant and prefer things, believe and feel things, recall and expect\nthings. And all these dimensions of our life, including our pleasure\nand pain, our enjoyment and suffering, our satisfaction and\nfrustration, our continued existence or our untimely death—all\nmake a difference to the quality of our life as lived, as experienced,\nby us as individuals. As the same is true of … animals …\nthey too must be viewed as the experiencing subjects of a life, with\ninherent value of their own. (Regan 1985: 24)  \nA third way of addressing this problem has been taken up by Korsgaard\nwho maintains that there is a big difference between those with\nnormative, rational capacities and those without, but unlike Kant,\nbelieves both humans and non-humans are the proper objects of our\nmoral concern. She argues that those without normative, rational\ncapacities share certain “natural” capacities with\npersons, and these natural capacities are often the content of the\nmoral demands that persons make on each other. She writes,  \nwhat we demand, when we demand … recognition, is that our\nnatural concerns—the objects of our natural desires and\ninterests and affections—be accorded the status of values,\nvalues that must be respected as far as possible by others. And many\nof those natural concerns—the desire to avoid pain is an obvious\nexample—spring from our animal nature, not from our rational\nnature. (Korsgaard 2007: 7)  \nWhat moral agents construct as valuable and normatively binding is not\nonly our rational or autonomous capacities, but the needs and desires\nwe have as living, embodied beings. Insofar as these needs and desires\nare valuable for agents, the ability to experience similar needs and\ndesires in patients should also be valued. \nIn the courts, all humans and some corporations are considered persons\nin the legal sense. But all animals, infants and adults, are not legal\npersons, but rather, under the law they are considered property. There\nhave been a few attempts to change the legal status of some nonhuman\nanimals from property to persons. The Nonhuman Rights Project (NhRP)\nfounded by Steven Wise, has filed a series of cases in the New York\ncourts seeking to establish legal personhood for particular\nchimpanzees being held in the state, with the goal of protecting their\nrights to bodily integrity and liberty, and allow them to seek remedy,\nthrough their proxies, when those rights are violated. Chimpanzees are\na good test case for establishing nonhuman legal personhood as they\nare, according to the documents filed by NhRP, autonomous beings with\nsophisticated cognitive abilities including  \nepisodic memory, self-consciousness, self-knowing, self agency,\nreferential and intentional communication, mental time-travel,\nnumerosity, sequential learning, meditational learning, mental state\nmodeling, visual perspective taking, understanding the experiences of\nothers, intentional action, planning, imagination, empathy,\nmetacognition, working memory, decision-making, imitation, deferred\nimitation, emulation, innovation, material, social, and symbolic\nculture, cross-modal perception, tool-use, tool-making,\ncause-and-effect. (petition of NhRP v. Samuel Stanley, p. 12, see Other Internet Resources) \nThe legal arguments to extend personhood beyond the human parallel\nmore general ethical arguments that extend ethical consideration\noutward from those who occupy the moral center. Turning to empirical\nwork designed to show that other animals are really similar to those\nconsidered legal persons, primatologists submitted affidavits\nattesting to what they have learned working with chimpanzees. Mary Lee\nJensvold suggests  \nthere are numerous parallels in the way chimpanzee and human\ncommunication skills develop over time, suggesting a similar unfolding\ncognitive process across the two species and an underlying\nneurobiological continuity. (Jensvold affidavit, p. 4, in Other Internet Resources)\n \nJames King notes  \nchimpanzees and humans resemble each other in terms of their ability\nto experience happiness and the way in which it relates to individual\npersonality. (King affidavit, p. 8, in Other Internet Resources)  \nAnd Mathias Osvath makes remarkable claims about chimpanzee\npersonhood: Autonoetic consciousness gives an  individual of any species an\nautobiographical sense of it self with a future and a past. Chimps and\nother great apes clearly possess an autobiographical self, as they are\nable to prepare themselves for future actions… they likely can,\njust as humans, be in pain over an anticipated future event that has\nyet to occur. For instance, confining someone in a prison or cage for\na set time, or for life, would lose much of its power as punishment if\nthat individual had no self-concept. Every moment would be a new\nmoment with no conscious relation to the next. But, chimpanzees. and\nother great apes have a concept of their personal past and future and\ntherefore suffer the pain of not being able to fulfill one’s\ngoals or move around as one wants; like humans they experience the\npain of anticipating a never-ending situation.  (Osvath affidavit, pp. 4–7, in Other Internet Resources) \nThese claims, as well as those of others experts, identify the\nrelevantly similar capacities that chimpanzees and other great apes\nshare with humans and it is in virtue of these capacities that legal\npersonhood is sought. \nUsing rational nature or cognitive capacities as the touchstone of\nmoral considerability misses an important fact about animals, human\nand nonhuman. Our lives can go better or worse for us. Utilitarians\nhave traditionally argued that the truly morally important feature of\nbeings is unappreciated when we focus on personhood or the rational,\nself-reflective nature of humans, or the relation a being stands in to\nsuch nature, or being the subject of a life, or being legal persons.\nWhat is really important, utilitarians maintain, is the promotion of\nhappiness, or pleasure, or the satisfaction of interests, and the\navoidance of pain, or suffering, or frustration of interests. Bentham,\none of the more forceful defenders of this sentientist view of moral\nconsiderability, famously wrote: \nOther animals, which, on account of their interests having been\nneglected by the insensibility of the ancient jurists, stand degraded\ninto the class of things. [original emphasis] … The\nday has been, I grieve it to say in many places it is not yet past, in\nwhich the greater part of the species, under the denomination of\nslaves, have been treated … upon the same footing as …\nanimals are still. The day may come, when the rest of the animal\ncreation may acquire those rights which never could have been\nwithholden from them but by the hand of tyranny. The French have\nalready discovered that the blackness of skin is no reason why a human\nbeing should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a\ntormentor. It may come one day to be recognized, that the number of\nlegs, the villosity of the skin, or the termination of the\nossacrum, are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a\nsensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace\nthe insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason, or perhaps, the\nfaculty for discourse?…the question is not, Can they\nreason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they\nsuffer? (Bentham 1780/1789: chapter xvii, paragraph 6)  Contemporary utilitarians, such as Peter Singer (1990, 1979\n[1993]), suggest that there is no morally justifiable way to exclude\nfrom moral consideration non-humans or non-persons who can clearly\nsuffer. Any being that has an interest in not suffering deserves to\nhave that interest taken into account. And a non-human who acts to\navoid pain can be thought to have just such an interest. Even\ncontemporary Kantians have acknowledged the moral force of the\nexperience of pain.  Korsgaard, for example, writes “it is a\npain to be in pain. And that is not a trivial fact” (1996:\n154). \nWhen you pity a suffering animal, it is because you are perceiving a\nreason. An animal’s cries express pain, and they mean that there\nis a reason, a reason to change its conditions. And you can no more\nhear the cries of an animal as mere noise than you can the words of a\nperson. Another animal can obligate you in exactly the same way\nanother person can. …So of course we have obligations to\nanimals. (Korsgaard 1996: 153) \nWhen we encounter an animal in pain we recognize their claim on us,\nand thus beings who can suffer are morally considerable. \nThat non-human animals can make moral claims on us does not in itself\nindicate how such claims are to be assessed and conflicting claims\nadjudicated. Being morally considerable is like showing up on a moral\nradar screen—how strong the signal is or where it is located on\nthe screen are separate questions. Of course, how one argues for the\nmoral considerability of non-human animals will inform how we are to\nunderstand the force of an animal’s claims. \nAccording to the view that an animal’s moral claim is equivalent\nto a moral right, any action that fails to treat the animal as a being\nwith inherent worth would violate that animal’s right and is\nthus morally objectionable. According to the animal rights position,\nto treat an animal as a means to some human end, as many humans do\nwhen they eat animals or experiment on them, is to violate that\nanimal’s right. As Tom Regan has written, \n…animals are treated routinely, systematically as if their\nvalue were reducible to their usefulness to others, they are\nroutinely, systematically treated with a lack of respect, and thus are\ntheir rights routinely, systematically violated. (Regan 1985: 24). \nThe animal rights position is an absolutist position. Any being that\nis a subject of a life has inherent worth and the rights that protect\nsuch worth, and all subjects of a life have these rights equally. Thus\nany practice that fails to respect the rights of those animals who\nhave them, e.g., eating animals, hunting animals, experimenting on\nanimals, using animals for entertainment, is wrong, irrespective of\nhuman need, context, or culture. \nThe utilitarian position on animals, most commonly associated with\nPeter Singer and popularly, though erroneously, referred to as an\nanimal rights position, is actually quite distinct. Here the moral\nsignificance of the claims of animals depends on what other morally\nsignificant competing claims might be in play in any given situation.\nWhile the equal interests of all morally considerable beings are\nconsidered equally, the practices in question may end up violating or\nfrustrating some interests but would not be considered morally wrong\nif, when all equal interests are considered, more of these interests\nare satisfied than frustrated. For utilitarians like Singer, what\nmatters are the strength and nature of interests, not whose interests\nthese are. So, if the only options available in order to save the life\nof one morally considerable being is to cause harm, but not death, to\nanother morally considerable being, then according to a utilitarian\nposition, causing this harm may be morally justifiable. Similarly, if\nthere are two courses of action, one which causes extreme amounts of\nsuffering and ultimate death, and one which causes much less suffering\nand painless death, then the latter would be morally preferable to the\nformer. \nConsider factory farming, the most common method used to convert\nanimal bodies into relatively inexpensive food in industrialized\nsocieties today. An estimated 8 billion animals in the United States\nare born, confined, biologically manipulated, transported and\nultimately slaughtered each year so that humans can consume them. The\nconditions in which these animals are raised and the method of\nslaughter causes vast amounts of suffering (see, for example, Mason\n& Singer 1980 [1990]). Given that animals suffer under such conditions\nand assuming that suffering is not in their interests, then the\npractice of factory farming would only be morally justifiable if its\nabolition were to cause greater suffering or a greater amount of\ninterest frustration. Certainly humans who take pleasure in eating\nanimals will find it harder to satisfy these interests in the absence\nof factory farms; it may cost more and require more effort to obtain\nanimal products. The factory farmers, and the industries that support\nfactory farming, will also have certain interests frustrated if\nfactory farming were to be abolished. How much interest frustration\nand interest satisfaction would be associated with the end to factory\nfarming is largely an empirical question. But utilitarians are not\nmaking unreasonable predictions when they argue that on balance the\nsuffering and interest frustration that animals experience in modern\nday meat production is greater than the suffering that humans would\nendure if they had to alter their current practices. \nImportantly, the utilitarian argument for the moral significance of\nanimal suffering in meat production is not an argument for\nvegetarianism. If an animal lived a happy life and was painlessly\nkilled and then eaten by people who would otherwise suffer hunger or\nmalnutrition by not eating the animal, then painlessly killing and\neating the animal would be the morally justified thing to do. In many\nparts of the world where economic, cultural, or climate conditions\nmake it virtually impossible for people to sustain themselves on plant\nbased diets, killing and eating animals that previously led relatively\nunconstrained lives and are painlessly killed, would not be morally\nobjectionable. The utilitarian position can thus avoid certain charges\nof cultural chauvinism and moralism, charges that the animal rights\nposition apparently cannot avoid. \nIt might be objected that to suggest that it is morally acceptable to\nhunt and eat animals for those people living in arctic regions, or for\nnomadic cultures, or for poor rural peoples, for example, is to\npotentially condone painlessly killing other morally considerable\nbeings, like humans, for food consumption in similar situations. If\nviolating the rights of an animal can be morally tolerated, especially\na right to life, then similar rights violations can be morally\ntolerated. In failing to recognize the inviolability of the moral\nclaims of all morally considerable beings, utilitarianism cannot\naccommodate one of our most basic prima facie principles, namely that\nkilling a morally considerable being is wrong. \nThere are at least two replies to this sort of objection. The first\nappeals to the negative side effects that killing may promote. If, to\ndraw on an overused and sadly sophomoric counter-example, one person\ncan be kidnapped and painlessly killed in order to provide body parts\nfor four individuals who will die without them, there will inevitably\nbe negative side-effects that all things considered would make the\nkidnapping wrong. Healthy people, knowing they could be used for spare\nparts, might make themselves unhealthy to avoid such a fate or they\nmay have so much stress and fear that the overall state of affairs\nwould be worse than that in which four people died. Appealing to\nside-effects when it comes to the wrong of killing is certainly\nplausible, but it fails to capture what is directly wrong with\nkilling. \nA more satisfying reply would have us adopt what might be called a\nmulti-factor perspective, one that takes into account the kinds of\ninterest that are possible for certain kinds of morally considerable\nbeings, the content of interests of the beings in question, their\nrelative weight, and the context of those who have them. Consider a\nseal who has spent his life freely roaming the oceans and ice flats\nand who is suddenly and painlessly killed to provide food for a human\nfamily struggling to survive a bitter winter in far northern climes.\nWhile it is probably true that the seal had an immediate interest in\navoiding suffering, it is less clear that the seal has a future\ndirected interest in continued existence. If the seal lacks this\nfuture directed interest, then painlessly killing him does not violate\nthis interest. The same cannot be said for the human explorer who\nfinds himself face to face with a hungry Inuit family. Persons\ngenerally have interests in continued existence, interests that,\narguably, non-persons do not have. So one factor that can be appealed\nto is that non-persons may not have the range of interests that\npersons do. \nAn additional factor is the type of interest in question. We can think\nof interests as scalar; crucial interests are weightier than important\ninterests, important interests are weightier than replaceable\ninterests, and all are weightier than trivial interests or mere whims.\nWhen there is a conflict of interests, crucial interests will always\noverride important interests, important interests will always override\nreplaceable interests, etc. So if an animal has an interest in not\nsuffering, which is arguably a crucial interest, or at least an\nimportant one, and a person has an interest in eating that animal when\nthere are other things to eat, meaning that interest is replaceable,\nthen the animal has the stronger interest and it would be wrong to\nviolate that interest by killing the animal for food if there is\nanother source of food available. \nOften, however, conflicts of interests are within the same category.\nThe Inuit’s interest in food is crucial and the explorer’s\ninterest in life is crucial. If we assume that the explorer cannot\notherwise provide food for the hunter, then it looks as if there is a\nconflict within the same category. If you take the interests of an\nindigenous hunter’s whole family into account, then their\ncombined interest in their own survival appears to outweigh the\nhapless explorer’s interest in continued existence. Indeed, if\npainlessly killing and eating the explorer were the only way for the\nfamily to survive, then perhaps this action would be morally condoned.\nBut this is a rather extreme sort of example, one in which even our\ndeepest held convictions are strained. So it is quite hard to know\nwhat to make of the clash between what a utilitarian would condone and\nwhat our intuitions tell us we should believe here. Our most basic\nprima facie principles arise and are accepted under ordinary\ncircumstances. Extraordinary circumstances are precisely those in\nwhich such principles or precepts give\n way.[2] \nThe multi-factor utilitarian perspective is particularly helpful when\nconsidering the use of animals in medical research. According to the\nanimal rights position, the use of animals in experimental procedures\nis a clear violation of their rights—they are being used as a\nmere means to some possible end—and thus animal rights\nproponents are in favor of the abolition of all laboratory research.\nThe utilitarian position, particularly one that incorporates some kind\nof multi-factor perspective, might allow some research on animals\nunder very specific conditions. Before exploring what a utilitarian\nmight condone in the way of animal experimentation, let us first\nquickly consider what would be morally prohibited. All research that\ninvolves invasive procedures, constant confinement, and ultimate death\ncan be said to violate the animal’s crucial interests. Thus any\nexperiments that are designed to enhance the important, replaceable,\nor trivial interests of humans or other animals would be prohibited.\nThat would mean that experiments for cosmetics or household products\nare prohibited, as there are non-animal tested alternatives and many\noptions already available for consumers. Certain psychological\nexperiments, such as those in which infant primates are separated from\ntheir mothers and exposed to frightening stimuli in an effort to\nunderstand problems teenagers have when they enter high school, would\nalso come into question. There are many examples of experiments that\nviolate an animal’s crucial interests in the hopes of satisfying\nthe lesser interests of some other morally considerable being, all of\nwhich would be objectionable from this perspective. \nThere are some laboratory experiments, however, that from a\nmulti-factor utilitarian perspective may be permitted. These are\nexperiments in which the probability of satisfying crucial or\nimportant interests for many who suffer from some debilitating or\nfatal disease is high, and the numbers of non-human animals whose\ncrucial interests are violated is low. The psychological complexity of\nthe non-humans may also be significant in determining whether the\nexperiment is morally justified. In the case of experimenting in these\nlimited number of cases, presumably a parallel argument could be made\nabout experimenting on humans. If the chances are very high that\nexperimenting on one human, who is a far superior experimental animal\nwhen it comes to human disease, can prevent great suffering or death\nin many humans, then the utilitarian may, if side effects are minimal,\ncondone such an experiment. Of course, it is easier to imagine this\nsort of extreme case in the abstract, what a utilitarian would think\nactually morally justified, again depends on the specific empirical\ndata. \nIn sum, the animal rights position takes the significance of morally\nconsiderable claims to be absolute. Thus, any use of animals that\ninvolves a disregard for their moral claims is problematic. The\nsignificance of an animal’s morally considerable interests\naccording to a utilitarian is variable. Whether an action is morally\njustified or permissible will depend on a number of factors. The\nutilitarian position on animals would condemn a large number of\npractices that involve the suffering and death of billions of animals,\nbut there are cases in which some use of non-human animals, and\nperhaps even human animals, may be morally justified (Gruen 2011: ch.\n4; Gilbert, Kaebnick, & Murray 2012). \nGiven the long-standing view that non-humans are mere things, there\nare still many who reject the arguments presented here for the moral\nconsiderability of non-humans and the significance of their interests.\nNonetheless, most now realize that the task of arguing that humans\nhave a unique and exclusive moral status is rather difficult. Yet even\namongst those who do view animals as within the sphere of moral\nconcern, there is disagreement about the nature and usefulness of the\narguments presented on behalf of the moral status of animals. \nIncreasingly, philosophers are arguing that while our behavior towards\nanimals is indeed subject to moral scrutiny, the kinds of ethical\narguments that are usually presented frame the issues in the wrong\nway. Some philosophers suggest that rational argumentation fails to\ncapture those features of moral experience that allow us to really see\nwhy treating animals badly is wrong. The point, according to\ncommentators such as Stephen R.L. Clark and Cora Diamond, for example,\nis that members of our communities, however we conceive of them, pull\non us and it is in virtue of this pull that we recognize what is wrong\nwith cruelty. Animals are individuals with whom we share a common life\nand this recognition allows us to see them as they are. Eating animals\nis wrong not because it is a violation of the animal’s rights or\nbecause on balance such an act creates more suffering than other acts,\nbut rather because in eating animals or using them in other harmful,\nviolent ways, we do not display the traits of character that kind,\nsensitive, compassionate, mature, and thoughtful members of a moral\ncommunity should display. \nAccording to some in the virtue ethics tradition, carefully worked out\narguments in which the moral considerability and moral significance of\nanimals are laid out will have little if any grip on our thoughts and\nactions. Rather, by perceiving the attitudes that underlie the use and\nabuse of non-human animals as shallow or cruel, one interested in\nliving a virtuous life will change their attitudes and come to reject\ntreating animals as food or tools for research. As Rosalind Hursthouse\nrecognized after having been exposed to alternative ways of seeing\nanimals: \nI began to see [my attitudes] that related to my conception of\nflesh-foods as unnecessary, greedy, self-indulgent, childish, my\nattitude to shopping and cooking in order to produce lavish dinner\nparties as parochial, gross, even dissolute. I saw my interest and\ndelight in nature programmes about the lives of animals on television\nand my enjoyment of meat as side by side at odds with one\nanother…Without thinking animals had rights, I began to see\nboth the wild ones and the ones we usually eat as having lives of\ntheir own, which they should be left to enjoy. And so I changed. My\nperception of the moral landscape and where I and the other animals\nwere situated in it shifted. (Hursthouse 2000: 165–166; see also\nDiamond 2001 [especially chs. 11 and 13], and Clarke 1977) \nAlice Crary argues that shifting perceptions of our moral landscapes\noccur because these landscapes, and more precisely the rich worlds of\nthose who inhabit them, are not morally neutral. The characteristics\nthat philosophers tend to look for in other animals to determine\nwhether or not they are morally considerable, according to Crary, are\nalready infused with moral importance, “human beings and other\nanimals have empirically discoverable moral characteristics” (my\nemphasis, 2016: 85) that are, as she puts it “inside\nethics”. These values often sneak in under a supposedly neutral\ngloss. By explicitly locating these characteristics inside ethics, the\ntexture, quality, and purposes of our ethical reflection on moral\nconsiderability changes. Arriving at an adequate empirical\nunderstanding requires non-neutral methods, identifying historical and\ncultural perspectives as shaping how we consider other animals\nmorally. What ethical questions we think are important and how we\nframe and answer them, will be different if we see our lives and the\nlives of other animals as already imbued with moral values.  \nOther feminist philosophers have taken issue with the supposedly\nmorally neutral methods of argumentation used to establish the moral\nstatus of animals. For many feminists the traditional methods of\nrational argumentation fail to take into account the feelings of\nsympathy or empathy that humans have towards non-humans, feelings they\nbelieve are central to a full account of what we owe non-humans and\nwhy (see Adams & Donovan 1995; Donovan & Adams 2007; Adams\n& Gruen 2014). \nFeminist philosophers have also challenged the individualism that is\ncentral in the arguments for the moral status of animals. Rather than\nidentifying intrinsic or innate properties that non-humans share with\nhumans, some feminists have argued instead that we ought to understand\nmoral status in relational terms given that moral recognition is\ninvariably a social practice. As Elizabeth Anderson has written:  \nMoral considerability is not an intrinsic property of any creature,\nnor is it supervenient on only its intrinsic properties, such as its\ncapacities. It depends, deeply, on the kind of relations they can have\nwith us. (Anderson 2004: 289). \nAnd these relationships needn’t be direct. The reach of human\nactivity has expanded across the entire globe and humans are entangled\nwith each other and other animals in myriad ways. We participate in\nactivities and institutions that directly or indirectly harm others by\ncreating negative experiences, depriving them of their well-being, or\ndenying them opportunities to be who they are and pursue what they\ncare about. Philosophers Elisa Aaltola and Lori Gruen have argued for\nrefining our empathetic imagination in order to improve our\nrelationships with each other and other animals. \nEven though it is challenging to understand what it is like to be\nanother, and even though we are limited by our inevitable\nanthropocentric perspectives, being in respectful ethical relation\ninvolves attempting to understand and respond to another’s\nneeds, interests, desires, vulnerabilities, hopes, and perspectives.\nWhat Gruen calls, “entangled empathy” is a process that\ninvolves both affect and cognition (Gruen 2015). Individuals who are\nempathizing with others respond to the other’s condition and\nreflectively imagine themselves in the distinct position of the other\nwhile staying attentive to both similarities and differences between\nherself and her situation and that of the fellow creature with whom\nshe is empathizing. Entangled empathy involves paying critical\nattention to the broader conditions that may negatively affect the\nexperiences and flourishing of those with whom one is empathizing, and\nthis requires those of us empathizing to attend to things we might not\nhave otherwise. It therefore also enhances our own experiences,\ndevelops our moral imagination, and helps us to become more sensitive\nperceivers.
