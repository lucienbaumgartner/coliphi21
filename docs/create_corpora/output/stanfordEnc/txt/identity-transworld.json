It therefore has its home in a\n‘possible-worlds’ framework for analysing, or at least\nparaphrasing, statements about what is possible or necessary.\n\n\nThe subject of transworld identity has been highly contentious, even\namong philosophers who accept the legitimacy of talk of possible\nworlds. Opinions range from the view that the notion of an identity\nthat holds between objects in distinct possible worlds is so\nproblematic as to be unacceptable, to the view that the notion is\nutterly innocuous, and no more problematic than the uncontroversial\nclaim that individuals could have existed with somewhat different\nproperties. Matters are complicated by the fact that an important\nrival to ‘transworld identity’ has been proposed: David\nLewis’s counterpart theory, which replaces the claim that an\nindividual exists in more than one possible world with the claim that\nalthough each individual exists in one world only, it has counterparts\nin other worlds, where the counterpart relation (based on similarity)\ndoes not have the logic of identity. Thus much discussion in this area\nhas concerned the comparative merits of the transworld identity and\ncounterpart-theoretic accounts as interpretations, within a\npossible-worlds framework, of statements of what is possible and\nnecessary for particular individuals.\n\nSuppose that, in accordance with the possible-worlds framework for\ncharacterizing modal statements (statements about what is possible or\nnecessary, about what might or could have been the case, what could\nnot have been otherwise, and so on), we treat the general statement\nthat there might have been purple cows as equivalent to the statement\nthat there is some possible world in which there are purple cows, and\nthe general statement that there could not have been round squares\n(i.e., that it is necessary that there are none) as equivalent to the\nstatement that there is no possible world in which there are round\nsquares. \nHow are we to extend this framework to statements about what is\npossible and necessary for particular individuals—what\nare known as de re modal statements (‘de\nre’ meaning ‘about a thing’)—for example,\nthat Clover, a particular (actually existing) four-legged cow, could\nnot have been a giraffe, or that she could have had just three legs? A\nnatural extension of the framework is to treat the first statement as\nequivalent to the claim that there is no possible world in which\nClover is a giraffe, and the second as equivalent to the claim that\nthere is some possible world in which Clover is three-legged. But this\nlast claim appears to imply that there is some possible world in which\nClover exists and has three legs—from which it seems inescapably\nto follow that one and the same individual—Clover—exists\nin some merely possible world as well as in the actual world: that\nthere is an identity between Clover and some individual in another\npossible world. Similarly, it appears that the de re modal\nstatements ‘George Eliot could have been a scientist rather than\na novelist’ and ‘Bertrand Russell might have been a\nplaywright instead of a philosopher’ will come out as\n‘There is some possible world in which George Eliot (exists and)\nis a scientist rather than a novelist’ and ‘There is some\npossible world in which Bertrand Russell (exists and) is a playwright\nand not a philosopher’. Again, each of these appears to involve\na commitment to an identity between an individual who exists in the\nactual world (Eliot, Russell) and an individual who exists in a\nnon-actual possible world. \nTo recapitulate: the natural extension of the possible-worlds\ninterpretation to de re modal statements involves a\ncommitment to the view that some individuals exist in more than one\npossible world, and thus to what is known as ‘identity across\npossible worlds’, or (for short) ‘transworld\nidentity’. (It is questionable whether the shorthand is really\napt. One would expect a ‘transworld’ identity to mean an\nidentity that holds across (and hence within) one world, not\nan identity that holds between objects in distinct worlds.\n(As David Lewis (1986) has pointed out, our own Trans World Airlines\nis an intercontinental, not an interplanetary, carrier.) Nevertheless,\nthe term ‘transworld identity’ is far too well established\nfor it to be sensible to try to introduce an alternative, although\n‘interworld identity’ or even ‘transmodal\nidentity’ would in some ways be more appropriate.) But is this\ncommitment acceptable? \nTo say that there is a transworld identity between A and\nB is to say that there is some possible world\nw1, and some distinct possible world\nw2, such that A exists in\nw1, and B exists in\nw2, and A is identical with B.\n(Remember that we are treating the actual world as one of the possible\nworlds.) In other words, to say that there is a transworld identity is\nto say that the same object exists in distinct possible\nworlds, or (more simply) that some object exists in more than one\npossible world. \nBut what does it mean to say that an individual exists in a merely\npossible world? And—even if we accept that paraphrases of modal\nstatements in terms of possible worlds are in general\nacceptable—does it even make sense to say that actual\nindividuals (like you and your neighbour’s cat and the Eiffel Tower)\nexist in possible worlds other than the actual world? To know what a\nclaim of transworld identity amounts to, and whether such claims are\nacceptable, we need to know what a possible world is, and what it is\nfor an individual to exist in one. \nAmong those who take possible worlds seriously (that is, those who\nthink that there are possible worlds, on some appropriate\ninterpretation of the notion), there is a variety of conceptions of\ntheir nature. On one account, that of David Lewis, a non-actual\npossible world is something like another universe, isolated in space\nand time from our own, but containing objects that are just as real as\nthe entities of our world; including its own real concrete objects\nsuch as people, tables, cows, trees, and rivers (but also, perhaps,\nreal concrete unicorns, hobbits, and centaurs). According to Lewis,\nthere is no objective difference in status between what we call\n‘the actual world’ and what we call ‘merely possible\nworlds’. We call our world ‘actual’ simply because\nwe are in it; the inhabitants of another world may, with equal right,\ncall their world ‘actual’. In other words,\naccording to Lewis, ‘actual’ in ‘the actual\nworld’ is an indexical term (like ‘here’ or\n‘now’), not an indicator of a special ontological status\n(Lewis 1973, 84–91; Lewis 1986, Ch. 1). \nOn Lewis’s ‘extreme realist’ account of possible worlds,\nit looks as if, for Clover to exist in another possible world as well\nas the actual world would be for her to be a part of such a world:\nClover would somehow have to exist as a (concrete) part of two worlds,\n‘in the same way that a shared hand might be a common part of\ntwo Siamese twins’ (Lewis 1986, 198). But this is problematic.\nClover actually has four legs, but could have had three legs. Should\nwe infer that Clover is a part of some world at which she has only\nthree legs? If so, then how many legs does Clover have: four (since\nshe actually has four legs), or seven (since she has four in our world\nand three in the alternative world)? Worse still, we appear to be\nascribing contradictory properties to Clover: she has four\nlegs, and yet has no more than three. \nThose who believe in the ‘extreme realist’ notion of\npossible worlds may respond by thinking of Clover as having a\nfour-legged part in our world, and a three-legged part at some other\nworld. This is Yagisawa’s (2010) view (cf. Lewis 1986, 210–220).\nYagisawa thinks of concrete entities—everyday things such as\ncats, trees and macbooks—as extended across possible worlds (as\nwell as across times and places), in virtue of having stages\n(or parts) which exist at those worlds (and times and places).\nOrdinary entities thus comprise spatial, temporal and modal stages,\nall of which are equally real. Metaphysically, modal stages (and the\nworlds at which they exist) are on a par with temporal and spatial\nstages (and the times and places at which they exist). (This view is\nthe modal analogue of the ‘perdurance’ account of identity\nover time, according to which an object persists through time by\nhaving ‘temporal parts’ that are located at different\ntimes.) Thus, when we say that Clover has four legs in our world but\nonly three in some other world, we are saying that she has a\nfour-legged modal stage and a distinct three-legged modal stage.\nClover herself is neither four-legged nor three-legged. (However,\nthere is a sense in which Clover herself—the entity comprising\nmany modal stages—has awfully many legs, even though she\nactually has only four.) \nAnother option for the ‘extreme realist’ about possible\nworlds is to hold that Clover is four-legged relative to our world,\nbut three-legged relative to some other world. In general, qualities\nwe would normally think of as monadic properties are in fact relations\nto worlds. McDaniel (2004) defends a view along these lines. A feature\nof this account is that one and the same entity may exist according to\nmany worlds, for that entity may bear the exists-at relation\nto more than one world. Accordingly, the view is sometimes called\ngenuine modal realism with overlap (McDaniel 2004). This\nview, transposed to the temporal case, is precisely what the\nendurantist says: objects do not have temporal parts; each\nobject is wholly present at each time. (See the separate entry on\nTemporal Parts.) \nLewis rejects both of these options. He rejects the overlap view\nbecause of what he calls ‘the problem of accidental\nintrinsics’. On the overlap view, having four legs is a\nrelation to a world, and hence not one of Clover’s intrinsic\nproperties. In fact, any aspect of a particular that changes across\nworlds turns out to be non-intrinsic to that particular. As a\nconsequence, every particular has all its intrinsic properties\nessentially, which Lewis thinks is unacceptable (1986,\n199–209). \nLewis himself combines his brand of realism about possible worlds with\na denial of transworld identities. According to Lewis, instead of\nsaying that George Eliot (in whole or in part) inhabits more than one\nworld, we should say that she inhabits one world only (ours), but has\ncounterparts in other worlds. And it is the existence of counterparts\nof George Eliot who go in for a career in science rather than novel\nwriting that makes it true that she could have been a scientist rather\nthan a novelist (Lewis 1973, 39–43; 1968; 1986, Ch. 4). \nHowever, Lewis’s version of realism is by no means the only conception\nof possible worlds. According to an influential set of rival accounts,\npossible worlds, although real entities, are not concrete ‘other\nuniverses’, as in Lewis’s theory, but abstract objects such as\n(maximal) possible states of affairs or ‘ways the world might\nhave been’. (See Plantinga 1974; Stalnaker 1976; van Inwagen\n1985; Divers 2002; Melia 2003; Stalnaker 1995; also the separate entry\non Possible Worlds. A state of affairs S is\n‘maximal’ just in case, for any state of affairs\nS*, either it is impossible for both S and\nS* to obtain, or it is impossible for S to obtain\nwithout S*: the point of the restriction to the maximal is\njust that a possible world should be a possible state of affairs that\nis, in a relevant sense, complete.) \nOn the face of it, to treat possible worlds as abstract entities may\nseem only to make the problem of transworld identity worse. If it is\nhard to believe that you (or a table or a cat) could be part of\nanother Lewisian possible world, it seems yet harder to believe that a\nconcrete entity like you (or the table or cat) could be part of an\nabstract entity. However, those who think that possible\nworlds are abstract entities typically do not take the existence in a\nmerely possible world of a concrete actual individual to involve that\nentity’s being literally a part of such an abstract thing. Rather,\nsuch a theorist will propose a different interpretation of\n‘existence in’ such a world. For example, according to\nPlantinga’s (1973, 1974) version of this account, to say that George\nEliot exists in some possible world in which she is a scientist is\njust to say that there is a (maximal) possible state of affairs such\nthat, had it obtained (i.e., had it been actual), George Eliot would\n(still) have existed, but would have been a scientist. On this\n(deflationary) account of existence in a possible world, it appears\nthat the difficulties that accompany the idea that George Eliot leads\na double life as an element of another concrete universe as well as\nour own (or the idea that she is partially present in many such\nuniverses) are entirely avoided. On Plantinga’s account, to claim that\nan actual object exists in another possible world with somewhat\ndifferent properties amounts to nothing more risqué than the\nclaim that the object could have had somewhat different properties:\nsomething that few will deny. (Note that according to this account, if\nthe actual world is to be one of the possible worlds, then the actual\nworld must be an abstract entity. So, for example, if a merely\npossible world is ‘a way the world might have been’, the\nactual world will be ‘the way the world is’; if a merely\npossible world is a maximal possible state of affairs that is not\ninstantiated, then the actual world will be a maximal possible state\nof affairs that is instantiated. It follows that we must\ndistinguish the actual world qua abstract entity from\n‘the actual world’ in the sense of the collection of\nspatiotemporally linked entities including you and your surroundings\nthat constitutes ‘the universe’ or ‘the\ncosmos’. The sense in which you exist in this concrete universe\n(by being part of it) must be different from the sense in which you\nexist in the abstract state of affairs that is in fact instantiated\n(cf. Stalnaker 1976; van Inwagen 1985, note 3; Kripke 1980,\n19–20).) \nThe discussion so far may suggest that whether the notion of\ntransworld identity (that an object exists in more than one world) is\nproblematic depends solely on whether one adopts an account of\npossible worlds as concrete entities such as Lewis’s (in which case it\nis) or an account of possible worlds as abstract entities such as\nPlantinga’s (in which case it is not). However, it is arguable that\nmatters are not so simple, for a variety of reasons (to be discussed\nin Sections 3–5 below). \nThere may seem to be an obvious objection to the employment of\ntransworld identity to interpret or paraphrase statements such as\n‘Bertrand Russell could have been a playwright’ or\n‘George Eliot might have been a scientist’. A fundamental\nprinciple about (numerical) identity is Leibniz’s Law: the principle\nthat if A is identical with B, then any property of\nA is a property of B, and vice versa. In other\nwords, according to Leibniz’s Law, identity requires the sharing of\nall properties; thus any difference between the properties of\nA and B is sufficient to show that A and\nB are numerically distinct. (The principle here referred to\nas ‘Leibniz’s Law’ is also known as the Indiscernibility\nof Identicals. It must be distinguished from another (more\ncontroversial) Leibnizian principle, the Identity of Indiscernibles,\nwhich says that if A and B share all their\nproperties then A is identical with B.) However, the\nwhole point of asserting a transworld identity is to represent the\nfact that an individual could have had somewhat different\nproperties from its actual properties. Yet does not (for example) the\nclaim that a philosopher in the actual world is identical with a\nnon-philosopher in some other possible world conflict with Leibniz’s\nLaw? \nIt is generally agreed that this objection can be answered, and the\nappearance of conflict with Leibniz’s Law eliminated. We can note that\nthe objection, if sound, would apparently prove too much, since a\nparallel objection would imply that there can be no such thing as\ngenuine (numerical) identity through change of properties over time.\nBut it is generally accepted that no correct interpretation of\nLeibniz’s Law should rule this out. For example, Bertrand Russell was\nthrice married when he received the Nobel Prize for Literature; the\none-year-old Bertrand Russell was, of course, unmarried; does\nLeibniz’s Law force us to deny the identity of the prize-winning adult\nwith the infant, on the grounds that they differ in their properties?\nNo, for it seems that the appearance of conflict with Leibniz’s Law\ncan be dispelled, most obviously by saying that the infant and the\nadult share the properties of being married in 1950 and\nbeing unmarried in 1873, but alternatively by the proposal\nthat the correct interpretation of Leibniz’s Law is that the identity\nof A and B requires that there be no time such that\nA and B have different properties at that\ntime (cf. Loux 1979, 42–43; also Chisholm 1967). However,\nit seems that exactly similar moves are available in the modal case to\naccommodate ‘change’ of properties across possible worlds.\nEither we may claim that the actual Bertrand Russell and the\nplaywright in some possible world (say, w2) are\nalike in possessing the properties of being a philosopher in the\nactual world and being a non-philosopher in\nw2, or we may argue that Leibniz’s Law, properly\ninterpreted, asserts that the identity of A and B\nrequires that there be no time, and no possible world, such that\nA and B have different properties at that time\nand world. The moral appears to be that transworld identity\nclaims (combined with the view that some of an individual’s properties\ncould have been different) need no more be threatened by Leibniz’s Law\nthan is the view that there can be identity over time combined with\nchange of properties (Loux 1979, 42–43). \nIt should be mentioned, however, that David Lewis has argued that the\nreconciliation of identity through change over time with Leibniz’s Law\nsuggested above is oversimplified, and gives rise to a ‘problem\nof temporary intrinsics’ that can be solved only by treating a\npersisting thing that changes over time as composed of temporal parts\nthat do not change their intrinsic properties. (See Lewis 1986,\n202–204, and for discussion and further references, Hawley 2001;\nSider 2001; Lowe 2002; Haslanger 2003.) In addition, it is partly\nbecause Lewis regards the analogous account of transworld identity in\nterms of modal parts as an unacceptable solution to an analogous\n‘problem of accidental intrinsics’ that Lewis rejects\ntransworld identity in favour of counterpart theory (Lewis 1986,\n199–220; cf. Section 1.2 above). \nIn the discussion of transworld identity in the 1960s and 1970s (when\nthe issue came to prominence as a result of developments in modal\nlogic), it was debated whether the notion of transworld identity is\ngenuinely problematic, or whether, on the contrary, the alleged\n‘problem of transworld identity’ is merely a\npseudo-problem. (See Loux 1979, Introduction, Section III; Plantinga\n1973 and 1974, Ch. 6; Kripke 1980 (cf. Kripke 1972); Kaplan 1967/1979;\nKaplan 1975; Chisholm 1967; for further discussion see, for example,\nDivers 2002, Ch. 16; Hughes 2004, Ch. 3; van Inwagen 1985; Lewis 1986,\nCh. 4.) \nIt is difficult to pin down the alleged problem that is supposed to be\nat the heart of this dispute. In particular, although the main\nproponents of the view that the alleged problem is a pseudo-problem\nclearly intended to attack (inter alia) Lewis’s version of\nmodal realism, they did not attempt to rebut the thesis (discussed in\nSection 1.2 above) that if one is a Lewisian realist about\npossible worlds, then one should find transworld identity problematic.\nMatters are complicated by the fact that proponents of the view that\nthe alleged problem of transworld identity is a pseudo-problem were to\nsome extent responding to hypothetical arguments, rather than\narguments presented in print by opponents (see Plantinga 1974, 93).\nHowever, one central issue was whether the claim that an individual\nexists in more than one possible world (and hence that there are cases\nof transworld identity) needs to be backed by the provision of\ncriteria of transworld identity, and, if so, why. \nThe term ‘criterion of identity’ is ambiguous. In an\nepistemological sense, a criterion of identity is a way of telling\nwhether an identity statement is true, or a way of recognizing whether\nan individual A is identical with an individual B.\nHowever, the notion of a criterion of identity also has a metaphysical\ninterpretation, according to which it is a set of (non-trivial)\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for the truth of an identity\nstatement. Although a criterion of identity in the second\n(metaphysical) sense might supply us with a criterion of identity in\nthe first (epistemological) sense, it seems that something could be a\ncriterion of identity in the second sense even if it is unsuited to\nplay the role of a criterion of identity in the first sense. \nThe most influential arguments against the view that there is\na genuine problem of transworld identity (or ‘problem of\ntransworld identification’, to use Kripke’s preferred\nterminology) are probably those presented by Plantinga (1973, 1974)\nand Kripke (1980). Plantinga and Kripke appear to have, as their\ntarget, an alleged problem of transworld identity that rests on one of\nthree assumptions. The first assumption is that we must possess\ncriteria of transworld identity in order to ascertain, on the basis of\ntheir properties in other possible worlds, the identities of (perhaps\nradically disguised) individuals in those worlds. The second\nassumption is that we must possess criteria of transworld identity if\nour references to individuals in other possible worlds are not to miss\ntheir mark. The third assumption is that we must possess criteria of\ntransworld identity in order to understand transworld identity claims.\nAnyone who makes one of these assumptions is likely to think that\nthere is a problem of transworld identity—a problem concerning\nour entitlement to make claims that imply that an individual exists in\nmore than one possible world. For it does not seem that we possess\ncriteria of transworld identity that could fulfil any of these three\nroles. However, Plantinga and Kripke provide reasons for thinking that\nnone of these three assumptions survives scrutiny. If so, and if these\nassumptions exhaust the grounds for supposing that there is a problem\nof transworld identity, the alleged problem may be dismissed as a\npseudo-problem. \nThe three assumptions may be illustrated, using our examples of George\nEliot and Bertrand Russell, as follows. (The examples are alternated\nsimply for the sake of a little variety.) \n(1) The ‘epistemological’ assumption: We must possess a\ncriterion of transworld identity for George Eliot in order to be able\nto tell, on the basis of knowledge of the properties that an\nindividual has in some other possible world, whether that individual\nis identical with Eliot. \n(2) The ‘security of reference’ assumption: We must\npossess a criterion of transworld identity for Bertrand Russell in\norder to know that, when we say such things as ‘There is a\npossible world in which Russell is a playwright’, we are talking\nabout Russell rather than someone else. \n(3) The ‘intelligibility’ assumption: We must possess a\ncriterion of transworld identity for George Eliot in order to\nunderstand the claim that there is a possible world in which she is a\nscientist. \nThe epistemological assumption appears to imply that the point of our\nhaving a criterion of transworld identity for George Eliot would be\nthat we could then employ the criterion in order to ascertain\nwhich individual in a possible world is Eliot; if, on the other hand,\nwe do not possess such a criterion, we shall be unable to pick her out\nor identify her in other possible worlds (Plantinga 1973; 1974, Ch. 6;\nKripke 1980, 42–53; cf. Loux 1979, Introduction; Kaplan\n1967/1979). However, this suggestion, as stated, is vulnerable to the\ncharge that it is the product of confusion. For how could we\nuse a criterion of identity in the way envisaged? We must dismiss as\nfanciful the idea that if we had a criterion of transworld identity\nfor George Eliot, we could use it to tell, by empirical\ninspection of the properties of individuals in other possible\nworlds (perhaps using a powerful telescope (Kripke 1980, 44) or\n‘Jules Verne-o-scope’ (Kaplan 1967/1979, 93; Plantinga\n1974, 94)), which, if any, of those individuals is Eliot. For no one\n(including an extreme realist like Lewis) thinks that our\nepistemological access to other possible worlds is of this kind.\n(According to Lewis, other possible worlds are causally isolated from\nour own, and hence beyond the reach of our telescopes or any other\nperceptual devices.) But once we face up to the fact that a criterion\nof transworld identity (if we had one) could have no such empirical\nuse, the argument based on the epistemological assumption appears to\ncollapse. It is tempting to suggest that the argument is the product\nof the (perhaps surreptitious) influence of a misleading picture of\nour epistemological access to other possible worlds. As Kripke writes\n(using President Nixon as his example): \nOne thinks, in this [mistaken] picture, of a possible world as if it\nwere like a foreign country. One looks upon it as an observer. Maybe\nNixon has moved to the other country and maybe he hasn’t, but one is\ngiven only qualities. One can observe all his qualities, but, of\ncourse, one doesn’t observe that someone is Nixon. One observes that\nsomething has red hair (or green or yellow) but not whether something\nis Nixon. So we had better have a way of telling in terms of\nproperties when we run into the same thing as we saw before; we had\nbetter have a way of telling, when we come across one of these other\npossible worlds, who was Nixon. (1980, 43) \n(It is possible, though, that in this passage Kripke’s principal\ntarget is not a mistaken conception of our epistemological access to\nother possible worlds, but what he takes to be a mistaken\n(‘foreign country’) conception of their nature: a\nconception that (when divorced from the fanciful epistemology) would\nbe entirely appropriate for a Lewisian realist about worlds.) \nIt might be suggested that the point of a criterion of transworld\nidentity is that its possession would enable me to tell which\nindividual I am referring to when I say (for example) ‘There is\na possible world in which Russell is a playwright’. Suppose that\nI am asked: ‘How do you know that the individual you are talking\nabout—this playwright in another possible world—is\nBertrand Russell rather than, say, G. E. Moore, or Marlene Dietrich,\nor perhaps someone who is also a playwright in the actual world, such\nas Tennessee Williams or Aphra Behn? Don’t you need to be able to\nsupply a criterion of transworld identity in order to secure your\nreference to Russell?’ (Cf. Plantinga 1974, 94–97; Kripke\n1980, 44–47.) It seems clear that the right answer to this\nquestion is ‘no’. As Kripke has insisted, it seems\nspurious to suggest that the question how we know which individual we\nare referring to when we make such a claim can be answered only by\ninvoking a criterion of transworld identity. For it seems that we can\nsimply stipulate that the individual in question is Bertrand\nRussell (Kripke 1980, 44). \nSimilarly, perhaps, if I say that there is some past time at which\nAngela Merkel is a baby, and am asked ‘How do you know that it’s\nthe infant Angela Merkel that you are talking about, rather\nthan some other infant?’, an apparently adequate reply is that I\nam stipulating that the past state of affairs I am talking\nabout is one that concerns Merkel (and not some other\nindividual). It seems that I can adequately answer the parallel\nquestion in the modal case by saying that I am stipulating\nthat, when I say that there is some possible world in which Russell is\na playwright, the relevant individual in the possible world (if there\nis one) is Russell (and not some other potential or actual\nplaywright). \nA third job for a criterion of transworld identity might be this: in\norder to understand the claim that there is some possible\nworld in which George Eliot is a scientist, perhaps we must be able to\ngive an informative answer to the question ‘What would it take\nfor a scientist in another possible world to be identical with\nEliot?’ Again, however, it can be argued that this demand is\nillegitimate, at least if what is demanded is that one be able to\nspecify a set of properties whose possession, in another possible\nworld, by an individual in that world, is non-trivially necessary and\nsufficient for being George Eliot (cf. Plantinga 1973; Plantinga 1974,\n94–97; van Inwagen 1985). \nFor one thing, we may point to the fact that it is doubtful that, in\norder to understand the claim that there is some past time at\nwhich Angela Merkel is a baby, we have to be able to answer the\nquestion ‘What does it take for an infant at some past time to\nbe identical with Merkel?’ in any informative way. Secondly, it\nmay be proposed that in order to understand the claim that there is\nsome possible world in which George Eliot is a scientist, we can rely\non our prior understanding of the claim that she might have been a\nscientist (cf. Kripke 1980, 48, note 15; van Inwagen 1985). \nHowever, even if all three of these assumptions can be dismissed as\nbad, or at least inadequate, reasons for supposing that transworld\nidentity requires criteria of transworld identity (and hence for\nsupposing that there is a problem of transworld identity), it does not\nfollow that there are no good reasons for this supposition.\nIn particular, even if the three assumptions are discredited, a fourth\nclaim may survive: \n(4) There must be a criterion of transworld identity for\nRussell (in the sense of a set of properties whose possession by an\nobject in any possible world is non-trivially necessary and sufficient\nfor being Russell) if the claim that there is a possible world in\nwhich Russell is a playwright is to be true. (Such a set of properties\nwould be what is called a non-trivial individual essence of\nRussell, where an individual essence of an individual A is a\nproperty, or set of properties, whose possession by an individual in\nany possible world is both necessary and sufficient for identity with\nA.) \nThat this possibility is left open by the arguments so far considered\nis suggested by at least two points. The first concerns the analogy\ndrawn above between transworld identity and identity through time.\nEven if we can understand the claim that there is some past time at\nwhich Angela Merkel is a baby without being able to specify\ninformative (non-trivial) necessary and sufficient conditions for the\nidentity of the adult Angela Merkel with some previously existing\ninfant, it does not follow that there are no such necessary\nand sufficient conditions. And many philosophers have supposed that\nthere are such conditions for personal identity over time. Secondly,\nthe fact that one may be able to ensure, by stipulation, that one is\ntalking about a possible world in which Bertrand Russell (and\nnot someone else) is a playwright (if there is such a world) does not\nimply that, when making this stipulation, one is not\nimplicitly stipulating that this individual satisfies, in\nthat world, conditions non-trivially necessary and sufficient for\nbeing Russell, even if one is not in a position to say what these\nconditions are. \nThis second point is an extension of the observation that, if (as most\nphilosophers believe) Bertrand Russell has some essential properties\n(properties that he has in all possible worlds in which he exists), to\nstipulate that one is talking about a possible world in which Russell\nis a playwright is, at least implicitly, to stipulate that the\npossible world is one in which someone with Russell’s essential\nproperties is a playwright. For example, according to Kripke’s\n‘necessity of origin’ thesis, human beings have their\nparents essentially (Kripke 1980). If this is correct, then, when we\nsay ‘There is a possible world in which Russell is a\nplaywright’, it seems that, if our stipulation is to be\ncoherent, we must be at least implicitly stipulating that the possible\nworld is one in which someone with Russell’s actual parents\nis a playwright, even if the identity of Russell’s parents is unknown\nto us, and even though we are (obviously) in no position to conduct an\nempirical investigation into the ancestry, in the possible world, of\nthe individuals who exist there. \nThus, it seems, even if Kripke is right in insisting that we need not\nbe able to specify non-trivial necessary and sufficient\nconditions for being Russell in another possible world if we are\nlegitimately to claim that there are possible worlds in which he is a\nplaywright, it might nevertheless be the case that there are\nsuch necessary and sufficient conditions (cf. Kripke 1980, 46–47\nand 18, note 17; Lewis 1986, 222). \nBut what positive reasons are there for holding that transworld\nidentities require non-trivial necessary and sufficient conditions\n(non-trivial individual essences), if arguments that are based on the\nepistemological, security of reference, and intelligibility\nassumptions are abandoned? \nThe principal argument for this view—that transworld identities\nrequire non-trivial individual essences—is that such essences\nare needed in order to avoid what have been called ‘bare\nidentities’ across possible worlds. And some regard bare\nidentities as too high a price to pay for the characterization of\nde re modal statements in terms of transworld identity. If\nthey are right, and if (as many philosophers believe) there are no\nplausible candidates for non-trivial individual essences (at least for\nsuch things as people, cats, trees, and tables) there is, indeed, a\nserious problem about transworld identity. (The expression ‘bare\nidentities’ is taken from Forbes 1985. The notion, as used here,\nis approximately the same as the notion of ‘primitive\nthisness’ employed by Adams (1979), although Adams’s notion is\nthat of an identity that does not supervene on qualitative facts,\nrather than an identity that does not supervene on any other facts at\nall.) \nSuppose that we combine transworld identity with the claim (without\nwhich the introduction of transworld identity seems pointless) that a\ntransworld identity can hold between A in\nw1 and B in w2 even\nthough the properties that B has in w2\nare somewhat different from the properties that A has in\nw1 (or, to put it more simply, suppose that we\ncombine the claim that there are transworld identities with the claim\nthat not all of a thing’s properties are essential to it). Then, it\ncan be argued, unless there are non-trivial individual essences, we\nare in danger of having to admit the existence of possible worlds that\ndiffer from one another only in the identities of some of the\nindividuals that they contain. \nOne such argument, adapted from Chisholm 1967, goes as follows. Taking\nAdam and Noah in the actual world as our examples (and pretending, for\nthe sake of the example, that the biblical characters are real\npeople), then, on the plausible assumption that not all of their\nproperties are essential to them, it seems that there is a possible\nworld in which Adam is a little more like the actual Noah than he\nactually was, and Noah a little more like the actual Adam than he\nactually was. But if there is such a world, then it seems that there\nshould be a further world in which Adam is yet more like the actual\nNoah, and Noah yet more like the actual Adam. Proceeding in this way,\nit looks as if we may arrive ultimately at a possible world that is\nexactly like the actual world, except that Adam and Noah have\n‘switched roles’ (plus any further differences that follow\nlogically from this, such as the fact that in the\n‘role-switching’ world Eve is the consort of a man who\nplays the Adam role, but is in fact Noah). But if this can happen with\nAdam and Noah, then it seems that it could happen with any two actual\nindividuals. For example, it looks as if there will be a possible\nworld that is a duplicate of the actual world except for the fact that\nin this world you play the role that Queen Victoria plays in\nthe actual world, and she plays the role that you play in the\nactual world (cf. Chisholm 1967, p. 83 in 1979). But this may seem\nintolerable. Is it really the case that Queen Victoria could have had\nall your actual properties (except for identity with you)\nwhile you had all of hers (except for identity with her)? \nHowever, if one thinks that such conclusions are intolerable, how are\nthey to be avoided? The obvious answer is that what is needed, in the\nAdam-Noah case, is that the roles played by Adam and Noah in the\nactual world include some properties that are essential to their\nbearers’ being Adam and Noah respectively: that Adam and Noah differ\nnon-trivially in their essential properties as well as in\ntheir accidental properties: more precisely, that Adam has some\nessential property that Noah essentially lacks, or vice versa. For if\n‘the Adam role’ includes some property that Noah\nessentially lacks, then, of course, there is no possible world in\nwhich Noah has that property, in which case the Adam role (in all its\ndetail) is not a possible role for Noah, and the danger of a\nrole-switching world such as the one described above is avoided. \nThe supposition that Adam and Noah differ in their essential\nproperties in this way, although sufficient to block the generation of\nthis example of a role-switching world, does not by itself imply that\neach of Adam and Noah has an individual essence: a set of\nessential properties whose possession is (not only necessary but also)\nsufficient for being Adam or Noah. Suppose that Adam has, as one of\nhis essential properties, living in the Garden of Eden, whereas Noah\nessentially lacks this property. This will block the possibility of\nNoah’s playing the Adam role, although it does not, by itself, imply\nthat nothing other than Adam could play that role. However,\nwhen we reflect on the potential generality of the argument, it\nappears that, if we are to block all cases of role-switching\nconcerning actual individuals, we must suppose that every actual\nindividual has some essential property (or set of essential\nproperties) that every other actual individual essentially lacks. For\nexample, to block all cases of role-switching concerning Adam and\nother actual individuals, there must be some component of ‘the\nAdam role’ that is not only essential to being Adam, but also\ncannot be played, in any possible world, by any actual individual\nother than Adam. \nEven if we suppose that all actual individuals are distinguished from\none another by such ‘distinctive’ essential properties,\nthis still does not, strictly speaking, imply that they have\nindividual essences. For example, it does not rule out the existence\nof a possible world that is exactly like the actual world except that,\nin this possible world, the Adam role is played, not by Adam, but by\nsome merely possible individual (distinct from all actual\nindividuals). However, if we find intolerable the idea that there are\nsuch possible worlds—worlds that, like the role-switching world,\ndiffer from the actual world only in the identities of some of the\nindividuals that they contain—then, it seems, we must suppose\nthat individuals like Adam (and Noah and you) have (non-trivial)\nindividual essences, where an individual essence of Adam is (by\ndefinition) some property (or set of properties) that is both\nessential to being Adam and also such that it is not possessed, in any\npossible world, by any individual other than Adam—i.e., an\nessential property (or set of properties) that guarantees that its\npossessor is Adam and no one else. \nChisholm (1967) arrives at his role-switching world by a series of\nsteps. Thus his argument appears to rely on the combination of the\ntransitivity of identity (across possible worlds) with the assumption\nthat a succession of small changes can add up to a big change. And\n‘Chisholm’s Paradox’ (as it is called) is sometimes\nregarded as relying crucially on these assumptions, suggesting that it\nhas the form of a sorites paradox (the type of paradox that\ngenerates, from apparently impeccable assumptions, such absurd\nconclusions as that a man with a million hairs on his head is bald).\n(See, for example, Forbes 1985, Ch. 7.) \nHowever, there are versions of the role-switching argument that do not\nrely on the cumulative effect of a series of small changes. Suppose we\nassume that Adam and Noah do not differ from one another in their\nessential properties; in other words, that all the differences between\nthem are accidental (i.e., contingent) differences. It seems\nimmediately to follow that any way that Adam could have been is a way\nthat Noah could have been, and vice versa. But one way that Adam could\nhave been is the way Adam actually is, and one way that Noah could\nhave been is the way Noah actually is. So (if Adam and Noah do not\ndiffer in their essential properties) it seems that there is a\npossible world in which Adam plays the Noah role, and a possible world\nin which Noah plays the Adam role. But there is no obvious reason why\na world in which Adam plays the Noah role and a world in which Noah\nplays the Adam role shouldn’t be the very same world. And in that case\nthere is a possible world in which Adam and Noah have swapped their\nroles. This argument for the generation of a role-switching world does\nnot rely on a series of small changes: all that it requires is the\nassumption that there is no essential difference between Noah and\nAdam: or, to put it another way, that any essential property of Noah\nis also an essential property of Adam, and vice versa. (See Mackie\n2006, Ch. 2; also Adams 1979.) \nAnother type of argument for the conclusion that unless things have\nnon-trivial individual essences there will be ‘bare’\ntransworld identities: identities that do not supervene on (are not\ngrounded in) other facts, is presented by Graeme Forbes. (Strictly\nspeaking, Forbes is concerned to avoid identities that are not\ngrounded in what he calls ‘intrinsic’ properties.) A\nsketch of a type of argument used by Forbes is this. (What follows is\nbased on Forbes 1985, Ch. 6; see also Mackie 2006, Ch. 3.) Suppose (as\nis surely plausible) that an actually existing oak tree could have\nbeen different in some respects from the way that it is; suppose also\nthat, even if it has some essential properties (perhaps it is\nessentially an oak tree, for example), it has no non-trivial\nindividual essence consisting in some set of its intrinsic properties.\nThen there is the danger that there may be three possible worlds (call\nthem ‘w2’,\n‘w3’, and\n‘w4’), where in w2\nthere is an oak tree that is identical with the original tree\n(w2 representing one way in which the tree could\nhave been different), and in w3 there is an oak\ntree that is identical with the original tree (w3\nrepresenting another way in which the tree could have been different),\nand in w4 there are two oak trees, one of\nwhich is an intrinsic duplicate of the tree as it is in\nw2, and the other an intrinsic duplicate of the\ntree as it is in w3. If all of\nw2, w3, and\nw4 are possible, then, given that at least one of\nthe trees in w4 is not identical with the original\ntree (since two things cannot be identical with one thing) there are\ninstances of transworld identity (and transworld distinctness)\nconcerning a tree in one possible world and a tree in another that are\nnot grounded in (do not supervene on) the intrinsic features that\nthose trees possess in those possible worlds. For example, suppose\nthat, of the two trees in w4, the intrinsic\nduplicate of the w2 tree is not identical\nwith the original tree. Then, obviously, the distinctness\n(non-identity) between this w4 tree and the tree\nin w2 is not grounded in the intrinsic features\nthat the trees have in w2 and\nw4—and nor is the identity between the tree\nin w2 and the original tree grounded in the\nintrinsic features that the tree has in w2 and in\nthe actual world. \nForbes argues that, in order to avoid this (and similar) consequences,\nwe should suppose that (contrary to the second assumption used in\nsetting up the ‘reduplication argument’ sketched above)\nthe oak tree does have a non-trivial individual essence\nconsisting in some of its intrinsic properties, and his favoured\ncandidate for its essence is one that includes the tree’s coming from\nthe particular acorn from which it actually originated. If the tree\ndoes have such an ‘intrinsic’ individual essence, then,\nif w2 and w3 are both\npossible, each of them must contain a tree that has (in that world)\nintrinsic properties that are guaranteed to be sufficient for\nidentity with the original tree, in which case (as a matter of logic)\nthere can be no world such as w4 that contains\nintrinsic duplicates of both of them. (See Forbes 1985, Ch. 6, and,\nfor discussion, Mackie 1987; Mackie 2006; Robertson 1998; Yablo 1988;\nChihara 1998; Della Rocca 1996; further discussions by Forbes include\nhis 1986, 1994, and 2002.) \nFinally, it is obvious that the structure of Forbes’s argument has\nnothing to do with the fact that the chosen example is a tree.\nForbes’s ‘reduplication argument’ therefore appears to\npose a general problem for the characterization of de re\nmodal statements about individuals in terms of transworld identity:\neither we must admit that their transworld identities can be\n‘bare’, or we must find non-trivial individual essences,\nbased on their intrinsic properties, that can ground their identities\nacross possible worlds. \nSo far it has been assumed that (non-trivial) necessary and sufficient\nconditions for transworld identity with a given object would involve\nthe possession, by that object, of an individual essence: a set of\nproperties that it carries with it in every possible world in which it\nexists. But one might wonder why we should make this assumption. Those\nwho believe that there are (non-trivial) necessary and sufficient\nconditions for identity over time need not, and almost universally do\nnot, believe that these conditions consist in the possession, by an\nobject, of some ‘omnitemporal core’ (to use a phrase\nsuggested by Harold Noonan) that it has at every time in its\nexistence. So why should things be different in the modal case? \nThe obvious answer seems to be this. In the case of identity over\ntime, we can appeal to relations (other than mere similarity) between\nthe states of an individual at different times in its existence. For\nexample, it looks as if we can say that the adult Russell is identical\nwith the infant Russell in virtue of the existence of certain\nspatiotemporal and causal continuities between his infant state in\n1873 and his adult state in (say) 1950 that are characteristic of the\ncontinued existence of a human being. But no such relations of\ncontinuity are available to ground identities across possible worlds\n(cf. Quine 1976). \nHowever, on reflection, it may seem that this is too swift. If we\nsuppose that any possible history for Russell is a possible\nspatiotemporal and causal extension of the state that he was actually\nin at some time in his existence, then perhaps we may appeal to the\nsame continuities that ground his identity over time in the actual\nworld in order to ground his identity across possible worlds (cf.\nBrody 1980, 114–115; 121). For example, perhaps to say that\nRussell could have been a playwright is to say that there was some\ntime in his actual existence at which he could have become a\nplaywright. If so, then perhaps we can hold that for a playwright in a\npossible world to be identical with Russell is for that playwright to\nhave, in that world, a life that is, at some early stage, exactly the\nsame as Russell’s actual life at some early stage, but which develops\nfrom that point, in the spatiotemporally and causally continuous\nfashion that is characteristic of the continued existence of a human\nbeing, into the career of a playwright rather than that of a\nphilosopher. However, although such a conception may seem initially\nattractive, it runs into difficulties if it is intended to provide\nconditions that are genuinely both necessary and sufficient for the\nidentity of individuals across possible worlds. These difficulties\ninclude the fact that it seems too much to demand that Russell have\nexactly the same early history (or origin) as his actual\nearly history (or origin) in every possible world in which he exists.\nYet if Russell’s early history could have been different in certain\nrespects, we face the question: ‘In virtue of what is an\nindividual in another possible world with a slightly\ndifferent early history from Russell’s actual early history\nidentical with Russell?’—a question of precisely the type\nthat the provision of necessary and sufficient conditions for\ntransworld identity was intended to answer. (For discussion of this\n‘branching’ conception of possibilities, and its\nimplications for questions of transworld identity and essential\nproperties, see Brody 1980, Ch. 5; Mackie 1998; Mackie 2006, Chs\n6–7; Coburn 1986, Section VI; McGinn 1976; Mackie 1974; Prior\n1960.) \nThe fact that, in the absence of non-trivial individual essences, a\ntransworld identity characterization of de re modal\nstatements appears to generate bare identities (via arguments such as\nChisholm’s Paradox or Forbes’s reduplication argument) may produce a\nvariety of reactions. \nThe moral that Chisholm (1967) drew from his argument was scepticism\nabout transworld identity, based partly on scepticism about whether\nthe non-trivial individual essences that would block the generation of\nrole-switching worlds are available. Others would go further, and\nconclude that such puzzles provide not only a reason for rejecting\ntransworld identity, but also a reason for adopting counterpart\ntheory. (Note, though, that Lewis’s reasons for adopting counterpart\ntheory appear to be largely independent of such puzzles (cf. Lewis\n1986, Ch. 4).) A third reaction is to accept bare\nidentities—or, at least, to accept that individuals (including\nactual individuals) may have qualitative duplicates in other possible\nworlds, and that transworld identities may involve what have been\ncalled ‘haecceitistic’ differences. (See Adams 1979;\nMackie 2006, Chs 2–3; Lewis 1986, Ch. 4, Section 4; also the\nseparate entry on Haecceitism.) A fourth reaction, that of Forbes, is\nto propose a mixed solution: he holds that for some individuals\n(including human beings and trees) suitable candidates for non-trivial\nindividual essences can be found (by appeal to distinctive features of\ntheir origins), although for others (including most artefacts) it may\nbe that no suitable candidates are available, in which case\ncounterpart theory should be adopted for these cases (see Forbes 1985,\nChs 6–7). \nIt is perhaps significant, though, that no theorist appears to have\nargued that a ‘non-trivial individual essence’ solution\ncan be applied to all the relevant cases. In other words, the\nconsensus appears to be that the price of interpreting all\nde re modal claims in terms of transworld identity (as\nopposed to counterpart theory) is the acceptance of bare identities\nacross possible worlds. \nFinally, it can be noted that the problems concerning transworld\nidentity discussed here arise only because it is assumed that not all\nof an individual’s properties are essential to it (and hence that, if\nit exists in more than one possible world, it has different properties\nin different worlds). If, instead, one were to hold that all\nof an individual’s properties are essential properties—and\nhence, for example, that George Eliot could not have existed with\nproperties in any way different from her actual ones—then no\nsuch problems would arise. Moreover, this suggestion, implausible\nthough it may be, is of some historical interest. For, according to a\nstandard interpretation of the views of Gottfried Leibniz, the\nphilosopher who is the father of theories of possible worlds,\nLeibniz’s theory of ‘complete individual notions’ commits\nhim to the thesis that an individual such as George Eliot\ndoes have all her properties essentially (cf. Leibniz,\nDiscourse on Metaphysics (1687), Sections 8 and 13; printed\nin Leibniz 1973 and elsewhere). According to the\n‘hyper-essentialist’ view to which Leibniz appears to be\ncommitted, any individual, in any possible world, whose properties in\nthat world differ from the actual properties of George Eliot is not,\nstrictly speaking, identical with Eliot. However, it also seems clear\nthat this does not represent a way of saving a transworld identity\ninterpretation of de re modality. On the contrary: if there\nis no possible world in which George Eliot exists with properties\ndifferent from her actual properties, then it is plausible to conclude\nthat there is no possible world, other than the actual world, in which\nshe exists at all. For unless possible worlds can be exact duplicates\n(something that Leibniz himself would deny), any merely possible world\nmust differ from the actual world in some respect. If so, then the\nproperties of any individual in another possible world must differ in\nsome respect from the actual properties of Eliot (even if the\ndifference is only a difference in relational properties), in which\ncase, if all Eliot’s properties are essential to her, that individual\nis not Eliot. (Leibniz’s views may, however, be seen as a partial\nanticipation of counterpart theory, which attempts to save the truth\nof the claim that George Eliot could have been different in\nsome respects (thus denying ‘hyper-essentialism’) while\npreserving the metaphysical thesis that no individual who is, strictly\nspeaking, identical with Eliot exists in any other possible world (cf.\nKripke 1980, 45, note 13).) \nThe view that an individual’s transworld identity is\n‘bare’ is sometimes described as the view that its\nidentity consists in its possession of a ‘haecceity’ or\n‘thisness’: an unanalysable non-qualitative property that\nis necessary and sufficient for its being the individual that it is.\n(The term ‘individual essence’ is sometimes used to denote\nsuch a haecceity. It should be noted that according to the terminology\nused in this article, although a haecceity would be an individual\nessence, it would not be a non-trivial individual essence.)\nHowever, it is not obvious that the belief in bare identities requires\nthe acceptance of haecceities. One can apparently hold that transworld\nidentities may be ‘bare’ without holding that they are\nconstituted by any properties at all, even unanalysable haecceities\n(cf. Lewis 1986, 225; Adams 1979, 6–7). Thus we should\ndistinguish what is standardly known as ‘haecceitism’\n(roughly, the view that there may be bare identities across possible\nworlds in the sense of identities that do not supervene on qualitative\nproperties) from the belief in haecceities (the belief that\nindividuals have unanalysable non-qualitative properties that\nconstitute their being the individuals that they are). (For more on\nthe use of the term ‘haecceitism’ see Lewis 1986, Ch. 4,\nSection 4; Adams 1979; Kaplan 1975, Section IV; also the separate\nentry on Haecceitism. For the history of the term\n‘haecceity’, see the entry on Medieval Theories of\nHaecceity.) \nIn addition, it should be noted that to believe in ‘bare’\ntransworld identities, in the sense under discussion here, is not to\nbelieve in ‘bare particulars’, if to be a bare particular\nis to be an entity devoid of (non-trivial) essential properties. As\nthe arguments discussed in Sections 4.1–4.2 above demonstrate, a\ncommitment to a ‘bare’ (or ‘ungrounded’)\ndifference in the identities of two individuals A and\nB in different possible worlds (two human beings, or two\ntrees, for example) does not imply that those individuals have no\nnon-trivial essential properties. All it implies is that A\nand B do not differ in their non-trivial essential\nproperties—and hence that, although there may well be\nnon-trivial necessary conditions for being A in any possible\nworld, and non-trivial necessary conditions for being B in\nany possible world, there are no non-trivial necessary conditions for\nbeing A that are not also necessary conditions for being\nB, and vice versa. (Cf. Adams’s ‘Moderate\nHaecceitism’ (1979, 24–26).) \nIt was argued above that the proponent of transworld identity without\nnon-trivial individual essences faces the prospect of bare\n(‘ungrounded’) identities across possible worlds. One such\nargument is Chisholm’s Paradox, which relies on the transitivity of\nidentity to produce the result that a series of small changes in the\nproperties of Adam and Noah leads to a world in which Adam and Noah\nhave swapped their roles. However, the transitivity of identity\ngenerates additional problems concerning transworld identity, some of\nwhich have nothing particularly to do with role-switching\npossibilities or bare identities. \nOne such argument is given by Chandler (1976). It can be illustrated\nsimply as follows (adapting Chandler’s own example). Suppose that\nthere is a bicycle originally composed of three parts: A1, B1, and C1.\n(We might suppose that A1 is the frame, and B1 and C1 the two wheels.)\nSuppose we think that any bicycle could have been originally composed\nof any two thirds of its original parts, with a substitute third\ncomponent. We may call this (following Forbes 1985) ‘the\ntolerance principle’; it is a development of the intuitively\nappealing thought that it is too much to demand, of an object such as\na bicycle, that it could not have existed unless all of its\noriginal parts had been the same. Suppose, further, that we think that\nno bicycle could have been originally composed of just one third of\nits original parts, even with substitutes for the other two thirds.\nCall this ‘the restriction principle’. The combination of\nthese assumptions generates a difficulty for the paraphrase of de\nre modal claims about bicycles in terms of transworld identity.\nFor if there is (as the tolerance principle allows) a possible world\nw2 in which our bicycle comes into existence\ncomposed of parts A1 + B1 + C2, where C1 ≠ C2, then, if we apply\nthe tolerance principle to this bicycle we must say that\nit could have come into existence (in some further possible\nworld w3) with any two thirds of those\nparts, with a substitute third component: for example, that it could\nhave come into existence (in w3) composed of A1 + B2 + C2,\nwhere B1 ≠ B2 and C1 ≠ C2. The bicycle in w3\nis, ex hypothesi, identical with the bicycle in\nw2, and the bicycle in w2 is,\nex hypothesi, identical with the original bicycle; so, by the\ntransitivity of identity, the bicycle in w3 is\nidentical with the original bicycle. Hence our assumptions have\ngenerated a contradiction. We have a bicycle in\nw3, originally composed of A1 + B2 + C2, that both\nis identical with the original bicycle (by the repeated application of\nthe tolerance principle, together with the transitivity of identity)\nand is not identical with the original bicycle (by the restriction\nprinciple). \nOne might complain that the version of the tolerance principle cited\nabove is too lenient. Perhaps it is not true that the bicycle could\nhave come into existence with just two thirds of its original\ncomponents: perhaps a threshold of, say, 90% or more is required.\nHowever, the simple argument given above can obviously be adapted to\ngenerate a contradiction between the restriction principle and any\ntolerance principle that permits some difference in the\nbicycle’s original composition, simply by introducing a longer chain\nof possible worlds. Thus the transitivity argument appears to force\nthe proponent of transworld identity to choose between two implausible\nclaims: that an object such as a bicycle has all of its original parts\nessentially (thus denying any version of the tolerance principle) and\nthat an object such as a bicycle could have come into existence with\nfew (if any) of its original parts (thus denying any (non-trivial)\nversion of the restriction principle). Moreover, it is clear that the\nproblem can be generalized to any object to which versions of the\ntolerance principle and the restriction principle concerning its\noriginal material composition have application, which appears to\ninclude all artefacts, if not biological organisms. \nIt seems legitimate to call this puzzle a ‘problem of transworld\nidentity’, for it turns partly on the transitivity of identity,\nand can be avoided by interpreting claims about how bicycles could\nhave been different (de re modal claims about bicycles) in\nterms of a counterpart relation that is not transitive (Chandler\n1976). Thus a counterpart theorist may admit that the bicycle could\nhave been originally composed of A1 + B1 + C2 rather than A1 + B1 +\nC1, on the grounds that (according to the tolerance principle) it has\na counterpart (in w2) that is originally so\ncomposed. And the counterpart theorist may admit that a bicycle (such\nas the one in w2) that is originally composed of\nA1 + B1 + C2 could have been originally composed of A1 + B2 + C2,\nsince (by the tolerance principle) it has a counterpart (in\nw3) that is originally so composed. However, since\nthe counterpart relation (unlike identity) is not transitive, the\ncounterpart theorist need not say that the bicycle in\nw3 that is originally composed of A1 + B2 + C2 is\na counterpart of the bicycle in the actual world\n(w1) originally composed of A1 + B1 + C1, for its\nsimilarity to the bicycle in w1 may be\ninsufficient to allow it to be that bicycle’s counterpart. Thus the\nnon-transitivity of the counterpart relation (a relation based on\nresemblance) appears neatly to allow the counterpart theorist to\nrespect both the tolerance principle and the restriction principle,\nwithout falling into contradiction. \nOne reaction to the transitivity puzzle is to abandon transworld\nidentity in favour of counterpart theory. But how—given the\nstructure of the puzzle—can the theorist who wishes to resist\nthat move, and retain transworld identity, respond? \nOne response would be to give up any non-trivial version of the\nrestriction principle, and hold that an artefact such as a bicycle\ncould have come into existence with an entirely different material\ncomposition from its actual original composition. Although this\ncountereintuitive view has been defended (for example, Mackie (2006)\nargues for it on grounds independent of the transitivity problem), it\nhas few adherents. \nA second response would be to give up the tolerance principle, and\nadopt what Roca-Royes (2016) calls an ‘inflexible’ version\nof the principle that the material origin of an artefact is essential\nto it, holding that an artefact such as a bicycle could not have come\ninto existence with a material composition in any way different from\nits actual original composition. Although this view is admittedly\ncounterintuitive, Roca-Royes argues that it provides the best solution\nto the ‘Four Worlds Paradox’ to be discussed in the next\nsection. (It can be noted that this transitivity problem—perhaps\nunlike Chisholm’s Paradox—has no obvious solution that appeals\nto non-trivial individual essences that does not include the claim\nthat a bicycle’s individual essence involves its having absolutely all\nits original parts, thus rejecting the tolerance principle.) \nA third solution to the transitivity problem has been proposed (by\nChandler, followed by Salmon) which apparently allows us to reconcile\nall three of the transitivity of identity, the tolerance principle,\nand the restriction principle. This is to say that although there\nare possible worlds (such as w3) in which\nthe bicycle is originally composed of only a small proportion of its\nactual original parts, such worlds are not possible relative to (not\n‘accessible to’) the initial world w1.\nFrom the standpoint of w1, such an original\ncomposition for the bicycle is only possibly possible: something that\nwould have been possible, had things been different in some possible\nway, but is not, as things are, possible (Chandler 1976; Salmon 1979;\nSalmon 1982, 238–240). Whether this solution is satisfactory is\ndisputed. Admittedly, there are some contexts in which we talk of\npossibility in a way that may suggest that the ‘accessibility\nrelation’ between possible worlds is non-transitive: that not\neverything that would have been possible, had things been different in\nsome possible way, is possible simpliciter. (If Ann had\nstarted writing her paper earlier, it would have been possible for her\nto finish it today. And she could have started writing her\npaper earlier. But, as things are, it is not possible for her to\nfinish it today.) Nevertheless, the idea that, as regards the type of\nmetaphysical possibility that is involved in puzzles such as that of\nthe bicycle, there might be states of affairs that are possibly\npossible and yet not possible (and hence that de re\nmetaphysical possibility and necessity do not obey the system of modal\nlogic known as S4) is regarded with suspicion by many\nphilosophers. \nIt should be noted that the ‘non-transitivity of\naccessibility’ response is distinct from an even more radical\nresponse, which rejects the principle of the transitivity of\nidentity—a principle definitive of the classical notion of\nidentity. For example, Priest (2010) denies the transitivity of\nidentity in the context of his dialetheism about truth and a\nparaconsistent logic in which the material conditional does not obey\nthe principle of modus ponens. Discussion of this extreme\nposition is, however, beyond the scope of this article. (On\ndialetheism and paraconsistent logic, see the separate entry on\nDialetheism. On the logic of identity, see the entry on Identity.) \nIt is fair to say that there is no consensus about how the proponent\nof transworld identity should respond to the transitivity problem\nposed by Chandler’s example. \nChandler’s transitivity argument can be adapted to produce a puzzle\nthat is like those discussed in Sections 4.1–4.2 above in that\nit involves the danger of ‘bare identities’, a puzzle that\nSalmon (1982) has called ‘The Four Worlds Paradox’. To\nillustrate the puzzle: suppose that the actual world\n(w1) contains a bicycle, a, that is\n(actually) originally composed of A1 + B1 + C1, and suppose that there\nis a possible world, w5, containing a bicycle,\nb (not identical with a), that is originally\ncomposed (in w5) of A2 + B2 + C1 (where A1 ≠ A2\nand B1 ≠ B2). Then, it seems, the application of the tolerance\nprinciple to each of a and b may generate two\nfurther possible worlds, in one of which (w6)\nthere is a bicycle with the original composition A1 + B2 + C1 that is\nidentical with a, and in the other of which\n(w7) there is a bicycle with the original\ncomposition A1 + B2 + C1 that is identical with b. Since\nthere need apparently be no further difference between the intrinsic\nfeatures of w6 and w7 on which\nthis difference in identities could depend, we appear to have a case\nof bare identities. This ‘Four Worlds Paradox’ is like\nChandler’s original transitivity puzzle in that it does not seem that\nan appeal to individual essences could solve it without conflicting\nwith the tolerance principle. If so, the proponent of transworld\nidentity (as opposed to counterpart theory) appears to be left with\ntwo options consistent with the transitivity of identity: the denial\nof the tolerance principle, and the acceptance of bare identities. It\nmay be argued, however, that the acceptance of bare identities can be\nmade more palatable in this case by the adoption of a non-transitive\naccessibility relation between possible worlds. (See Salmon 1982,\n230–252; and, for discussion, Roca-Royes 2016. For a defence of\nthe employment of counterpart theory to solve the Four Worlds Paradox,\nsee Forbes 1985, Ch. 7. For discussion of a radical response that\nretains the tolerance principle and yet avoids bare identities, but\nonly at the cost of claiming that two bicycles could completely\ncoincide in one possible world, simultaneously sharing all their\nparts, see Roca-Royes 2016, discussing Williamson 1990. On the\nrelevance to the Four Worlds Paradox to Kripke’s principle of the\nnecessity (essentiality) of origin for artefacts, see also Robertson\n1998 and Hawthorne and Gendler 2000.) \nOne of our initial questions (Section 1 above) was whether a\ncommitment to transworld identity—the view that an individual\nexists in more than one possible world—is an acceptable\ncommitment for one who believes in possible worlds. The considerations\nof Sections 4–5 above suggest that this commitment does involve\ngenuine (although perhaps not insuperable) problems, even for one who\nrejects David Lewis’s extreme realism about the nature of possible\nworlds. The problems do not arise directly from the notion of\nan individual’s existing in more than one possible world with\ndifferent properties. Rather, they derive principally from the fact\nthat it is hard to accommodate all that we want to say about the modal\nproperties of ordinary individuals (including all the things we want\nto say about their essential and accidental properties) if de\nre modal statements about such individuals are characterized in\nterms of their existence or non-existence in other possible\nworlds. \nThere is currently no consensus about the appropriate resolution of\nthese problems. In particular, there is no consensus about whether the\nadoption of counterpart theory is superior to the solutions available\nto a transworld identity theorist. A full examination of the issue\nwould require a discussion of the objections that have been raised\nagainst counterpart theory as an interpretation of de re\nmodality. And a detailed discussion of counterpart theory is beyond\nthe scope of this article. (For David Lewis’s presentation of\ncounterpart theory, the reader might start with Lewis 1973,\n39–43, followed by (the more technical) Lewis 1968. Early\ncriticisms of Lewis’s counterpart theory include those in Kripke 1980;\nPlantinga 1973; and Plantinga 1974, Ch. 6. Lewis develops the 1968\nversion of his counterpart theory in Lewis 1971 and 1986, Ch. 4; he\nresponds to criticisms in his “Postscripts to ‘Counterpart\nTheory and Quantified Modal Logic’” (1983, 39–46)\nand in Lewis 1986, Ch. 4. Other discussions of counterpart theory\ninclude Hazen 1979, the relevant sections of Divers 2002, Melia 2003,\nand the more technical treatment in Forbes 1985. More recent critiques\nof the theory (postdating Lewis’s 1986 response to his critics)\ninclude Fara and Williamson 2005 and Fara 2009.) \nOne way to argue in favour of transworld identity (distinct from the\ndefensive strategies discussed in Sections 4 and 5 above) is what we\nmight call ‘the argument from logical simplicity’ (Linsky\nand Zalta 1994, 1996; Williamson 1998, 2000). The argument begins by\nnoting that Quantified Modal Logic—which combines individual\nquantifiers and modal operators—is greatly simplified when one\naccepts the validity of the Barcan scheme,\n∀x□A → □∀xA\n(Marcus 1946). The resulting logic is sound and complete with respect\nto constant domain semantics, in which each possible world\nhas precisely the same set of individuals in its domain. The simplest\nphilosophical interpretation of this semantics is that one and the\nsame individual exists at every possible world. \nSeveral remarks on this argument are in order. First, its conclusion\nis very strong: it says that any entity that in fact exists or that\ncould have existed exists necessarily. There is no contingent\nexistence. This goes far beyond the claim that there are genuine\nidentities across worlds. (Williamson (2002) defends this conclusion\non independent grounds.) Second, the argument does not offer an\nexplanation of how transworld identities are possible; it insists only\nthat there are genuine transworld identities. (Nevertheless, the\nmetaphysical picture that can most naturally be ‘read off’\nthe constant-domain semantics treats properties-at-a-world as\nrelations between particulars and worlds, as on McDaniel’s modal\nrealism with overlap (McDaniel 2004), discussed in Section 1.2\nabove.)  \nThird, the argument is not best understood as the claim that, if one\ndoes not accept transworld identities, then one is forced\ninto denying the Barcan scheme (and hence forced into uncomfortable\nlogical territory). That claim would be true only if the Barcan scheme\nwere validated only by constant-domain semantics, which is\nnot the case. Counterpart-theoretic semantics can be restricted so as\nto validate the Barcan scheme, by insisting that the counterpart\nrelation is an equivalence relation which, for each particular\nx and world w, relates x to a unique\nparticular in w. (One could not then interpret the\ncounterpart relation in terms of similarity, as Lewis does.) Rather,\nthe argument should be understood as the claim that the best way to\ngain the advantages of a logic containing the Barcan scheme is by\nadopting constant-domain semantics (and genuine transworld identities\nalong with it). But just which metaphysical view counts as\n‘best’ here will involve a trade-off between many factors.\nThese include the simplicity of the constant-domain semantics, on the\none hand, but also arguments of the kind raised by Lewis against modal\nrealism with overlap, on the other. \nFinally, we can note that Lewis (1986) has presented a challenge to\nthe self-styled champions of ‘transworld identity’ to\nexplain why the view that they insist on deserves to be\ncalled a commitment to transworld identity at all. \nThroughout this article, it has been assumed that a commitment to\ntransworld identity may be differentiated from a commitment to\ncounterpart theory on the grounds that the transworld identity\ntheorist accepts, while the counterpart theorist denies, that an\nobject exists in more than one possible world (cf. Section\n1.2 above). However, as Lewis points out, there is a notion of\n‘existence according to a (possible) world’ that\nis completely neutral as between a counterpart-theoretic and a\n‘transworld identity’ interpretation. In terms of this\nneutral conception, as long as the counterpart theorist and transworld\nidentity theorist agree that Bertrand Russell could have been a\nplaywright instead of a philosopher, they must agree that Russell\nexists according to more than one world. In particular, they\nmust agree that, according to our world, he exists and is a\nphilosopher, and according to some other worlds, he exists\nand is a non-philosopher playwright (cf. Lewis 1986, 194). The\ndifference between the theorists, then, allegedly consists in their\ndifferent interpretations of what it is for Russell to exist\n‘according to’ a world. In the view of the counterpart\ntheorist, for Russell to exist according to a possible world in which\nhe is a playwright is for him to have a counterpart in that\nworld who is (in that world) a playwright. According to the transworld\nidentity theorist, it is supposed to be for Russell (himself) to\nexist in that world as a playwright. \nIf the transworld identity theorist were a Lewisian realist about\npossible worlds, this notion of existence in a world could be\nclearly distinguished from the neutral notion of existence\naccording to a world, on the grounds that the existence of\nRussell in a world would require his complete or partial presence as a\npart of such a world (cf. Section 1.2 above). But, as Lewis notes, the\nself-styled champions of ‘transworld identity’ who oppose\nhis counterpart theory are philosophers who repudiate a Lewisian\nrealist conception of what it takes for Russell to exist in more than\none possible world. Hence, he argues, there is a question about their\nentitlement to claim that, according to their theory, Russell exists\nin other possible worlds in any sense that goes beyond the\nneutral thesis (compatible with counterpart theory) that Russell\nexists according to other worlds. Thus Lewis writes (using\nthe 1968 US presidential candidate Hubert Humphrey as his\nexample): \nThe philosophers’ chorus on behalf of ‘trans-world\nidentity’ is merely insisting that, for instance, it is Humphrey\nhimself who might have existed under other conditions, … who\nmight have won the presidency, who exists according to many worlds and\nwins according to some of them. All that is uncontroversial. The\ncontroversial question is how he manages to have these modal\nproperties. (1986, 198) \nA natural reaction to Lewis’s challenge is to point out that a\nproponent of transworld identity who is not a Lewisian realist will\ntypically reject Lewis’s counterpart theory on the grounds that his\ncounterpart relation does not have the logic of identity. If so, then\n(pace Lewis) it is not the case, strictly speaking, that the\n‘philosophers’ chorus on behalf of “trans-world\nidentity”’ is merely insisting on the neutral claim that\nobjects exist according to more than one world. However, even if this\nis correct, it does not answer a further potential challenge. Suppose,\nas seems plausible, that there could be a counterpart relation that\n(unlike the one proposed by Lewis himself) is an equivalence relation\n(transitive, symmetric, and reflexive), and ‘one-one between\nworlds’. What would distinguish, in the case of a theorist\nwho is not a Lewisian realist about possible worlds, between, on\nthe one hand, a commitment to the interpretation of de re\nmodal statements in terms of such an ‘identity-resembling’\ncounterpart relation, and, on the other hand, a commitment to genuine\ntransworld identity (and hence to the view that an individual\ngenuinely exists in a number of distinct possible worlds)?\nThe aficionado of transworld identity owes Lewis a reply to this\nchallenge.","contact.mail":"penelope.mackie@nottingham.ac.uk","contact.domain":"nottingham.ac.uk"},{"date.published":"2006-07-25","date.changed":"2017-11-07","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-transworld/","author1":"Penelope Mackie","author2":"Mark Jago","author1.info":"http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/philosophy/people/penelope.mackie","entry":"identity-transworld","body.text":"\n\n\nThe notion of transworld identity—‘identity across\npossible worlds’—is the notion that the same object exists\nin more than one possible world (with the actual world treated as one\nof the possible worlds). It therefore has its home in a\n‘possible-worlds’ framework for analysing, or at least\nparaphrasing, statements about what is possible or necessary.\n\n\nThe subject of transworld identity has been highly contentious, even\namong philosophers who accept the legitimacy of talk of possible\nworlds. Opinions range from the view that the notion of an identity\nthat holds between objects in distinct possible worlds is so\nproblematic as to be unacceptable, to the view that the notion is\nutterly innocuous, and no more problematic than the uncontroversial\nclaim that individuals could have existed with somewhat different\nproperties. Matters are complicated by the fact that an important\nrival to ‘transworld identity’ has been proposed: David\nLewis’s counterpart theory, which replaces the claim that an\nindividual exists in more than one possible world with the claim that\nalthough each individual exists in one world only, it has counterparts\nin other worlds, where the counterpart relation (based on similarity)\ndoes not have the logic of identity. Thus much discussion in this area\nhas concerned the comparative merits of the transworld identity and\ncounterpart-theoretic accounts as interpretations, within a\npossible-worlds framework, of statements of what is possible and\nnecessary for particular individuals.\n\nSuppose that, in accordance with the possible-worlds framework for\ncharacterizing modal statements (statements about what is possible or\nnecessary, about what might or could have been the case, what could\nnot have been otherwise, and so on), we treat the general statement\nthat there might have been purple cows as equivalent to the statement\nthat there is some possible world in which there are purple cows, and\nthe general statement that there could not have been round squares\n(i.e., that it is necessary that there are none) as equivalent to the\nstatement that there is no possible world in which there are round\nsquares. \nHow are we to extend this framework to statements about what is\npossible and necessary for particular individuals—what\nare known as de re modal statements (‘de\nre’ meaning ‘about a thing’)—for example,\nthat Clover, a particular (actually existing) four-legged cow, could\nnot have been a giraffe, or that she could have had just three legs? A\nnatural extension of the framework is to treat the first statement as\nequivalent to the claim that there is no possible world in which\nClover is a giraffe, and the second as equivalent to the claim that\nthere is some possible world in which Clover is three-legged. But this\nlast claim appears to imply that there is some possible world in which\nClover exists and has three legs—from which it seems inescapably\nto follow that one and the same individual—Clover—exists\nin some merely possible world as well as in the actual world: that\nthere is an identity between Clover and some individual in another\npossible world. Similarly, it appears that the de re modal\nstatements ‘George Eliot could have been a scientist rather than\na novelist’ and ‘Bertrand Russell might have been a\nplaywright instead of a philosopher’ will come out as\n‘There is some possible world in which George Eliot (exists and)\nis a scientist rather than a novelist’ and ‘There is some\npossible world in which Bertrand Russell (exists and) is a playwright\nand not a philosopher’. Again, each of these appears to involve\na commitment to an identity between an individual who exists in the\nactual world (Eliot, Russell) and an individual who exists in a\nnon-actual possible world. \nTo recapitulate: the natural extension of the possible-worlds\ninterpretation to de re modal statements involves a\ncommitment to the view that some individuals exist in more than one\npossible world, and thus to what is known as ‘identity across\npossible worlds’, or (for short) ‘transworld\nidentity’. (It is questionable whether the shorthand is really\napt. One would expect a ‘transworld’ identity to mean an\nidentity that holds across (and hence within) one world, not\nan identity that holds between objects in distinct worlds.\n(As David Lewis (1986) has pointed out, our own Trans World Airlines\nis an intercontinental, not an interplanetary, carrier.) Nevertheless,\nthe term ‘transworld identity’ is far too well established\nfor it to be sensible to try to introduce an alternative, although\n‘interworld identity’ or even ‘transmodal\nidentity’ would in some ways be more appropriate.) But is this\ncommitment acceptable? \nTo say that there is a transworld identity between A and\nB is to say that there is some possible world\nw1, and some distinct possible world\nw2, such that A exists in\nw1, and B exists in\nw2, and A is identical with B.\n(Remember that we are treating the actual world as one of the possible\nworlds.) In other words, to say that there is a transworld identity is\nto say that the same object exists in distinct possible\nworlds, or (more simply) that some object exists in more than one\npossible world. \nBut what does it mean to say that an individual exists in a merely\npossible world? And—even if we accept that paraphrases of modal\nstatements in terms of possible worlds are in general\nacceptable—does it even make sense to say that actual\nindividuals (like you and your neighbour’s cat and the Eiffel Tower)\nexist in possible worlds other than the actual world? To know what a\nclaim of transworld identity amounts to, and whether such claims are\nacceptable, we need to know what a possible world is, and what it is\nfor an individual to exist in one. \nAmong those who take possible worlds seriously (that is, those who\nthink that there are possible worlds, on some appropriate\ninterpretation of the notion), there is a variety of conceptions of\ntheir nature. On one account, that of David Lewis, a non-actual\npossible world is something like another universe, isolated in space\nand time from our own, but containing objects that are just as real as\nthe entities of our world; including its own real concrete objects\nsuch as people, tables, cows, trees, and rivers (but also, perhaps,\nreal concrete unicorns, hobbits, and centaurs). According to Lewis,\nthere is no objective difference in status between what we call\n‘the actual world’ and what we call ‘merely possible\nworlds’. We call our world ‘actual’ simply because\nwe are in it; the inhabitants of another world may, with equal right,\ncall their world ‘actual’. In other words,\naccording to Lewis, ‘actual’ in ‘the actual\nworld’ is an indexical term (like ‘here’ or\n‘now’), not an indicator of a special ontological status\n(Lewis 1973, 84–91; Lewis 1986, Ch. 1). \nOn Lewis’s ‘extreme realist’ account of possible worlds,\nit looks as if, for Clover to exist in another possible world as well\nas the actual world would be for her to be a part of such a world:\nClover would somehow have to exist as a (concrete) part of two worlds,\n‘in the same way that a shared hand might be a common part of\ntwo Siamese twins’ (Lewis 1986, 198). But this is problematic.\nClover actually has four legs, but could have had three legs. Should\nwe infer that Clover is a part of some world at which she has only\nthree legs? If so, then how many legs does Clover have: four (since\nshe actually has four legs), or seven (since she has four in our world\nand three in the alternative world)? Worse still, we appear to be\nascribing contradictory properties to Clover: she has four\nlegs, and yet has no more than three. \nThose who believe in the ‘extreme realist’ notion of\npossible worlds may respond by thinking of Clover as having a\nfour-legged part in our world, and a three-legged part at some other\nworld. This is Yagisawa’s (2010) view (cf. Lewis 1986, 210–220).\nYagisawa thinks of concrete entities—everyday things such as\ncats, trees and macbooks—as extended across possible worlds (as\nwell as across times and places), in virtue of having stages\n(or parts) which exist at those worlds (and times and places).\nOrdinary entities thus comprise spatial, temporal and modal stages,\nall of which are equally real. Metaphysically, modal stages (and the\nworlds at which they exist) are on a par with temporal and spatial\nstages (and the times and places at which they exist). (This view is\nthe modal analogue of the ‘perdurance’ account of identity\nover time, according to which an object persists through time by\nhaving ‘temporal parts’ that are located at different\ntimes.) Thus, when we say that Clover has four legs in our world but\nonly three in some other world, we are saying that she has a\nfour-legged modal stage and a distinct three-legged modal stage.\nClover herself is neither four-legged nor three-legged. (However,\nthere is a sense in which Clover herself—the entity comprising\nmany modal stages—has awfully many legs, even though she\nactually has only four.) \nAnother option for the ‘extreme realist’ about possible\nworlds is to hold that Clover is four-legged relative to our world,\nbut three-legged relative to some other world. In general, qualities\nwe would normally think of as monadic properties are in fact relations\nto worlds. McDaniel (2004) defends a view along these lines. A feature\nof this account is that one and the same entity may exist according to\nmany worlds, for that entity may bear the exists-at relation\nto more than one world. Accordingly, the view is sometimes called\ngenuine modal realism with overlap (McDaniel 2004). This\nview, transposed to the temporal case, is precisely what the\nendurantist says: objects do not have temporal parts; each\nobject is wholly present at each time. (See the separate entry on\nTemporal Parts.) \nLewis rejects both of these options. He rejects the overlap view\nbecause of what he calls ‘the problem of accidental\nintrinsics’. On the overlap view, having four legs is a\nrelation to a world, and hence not one of Clover’s intrinsic\nproperties. In fact, any aspect of a particular that changes across\nworlds turns out to be non-intrinsic to that particular. As a\nconsequence, every particular has all its intrinsic properties\nessentially, which Lewis thinks is unacceptable (1986,\n199–209). \nLewis himself combines his brand of realism about possible worlds with\na denial of transworld identities. According to Lewis, instead of\nsaying that George Eliot (in whole or in part) inhabits more than one\nworld, we should say that she inhabits one world only (ours), but has\ncounterparts in other worlds. And it is the existence of counterparts\nof George Eliot who go in for a career in science rather than novel\nwriting that makes it true that she could have been a scientist rather\nthan a novelist (Lewis 1973, 39–43; 1968; 1986, Ch. 4). \nHowever, Lewis’s version of realism is by no means the only conception\nof possible worlds. According to an influential set of rival accounts,\npossible worlds, although real entities, are not concrete ‘other\nuniverses’, as in Lewis’s theory, but abstract objects such as\n(maximal) possible states of affairs or ‘ways the world might\nhave been’. (See Plantinga 1974; Stalnaker 1976; van Inwagen\n1985; Divers 2002; Melia 2003; Stalnaker 1995; also the separate entry\non Possible Worlds. A state of affairs S is\n‘maximal’ just in case, for any state of affairs\nS*, either it is impossible for both S and\nS* to obtain, or it is impossible for S to obtain\nwithout S*: the point of the restriction to the maximal is\njust that a possible world should be a possible state of affairs that\nis, in a relevant sense, complete.) \nOn the face of it, to treat possible worlds as abstract entities may\nseem only to make the problem of transworld identity worse. If it is\nhard to believe that you (or a table or a cat) could be part of\nanother Lewisian possible world, it seems yet harder to believe that a\nconcrete entity like you (or the table or cat) could be part of an\nabstract entity. However, those who think that possible\nworlds are abstract entities typically do not take the existence in a\nmerely possible world of a concrete actual individual to involve that\nentity’s being literally a part of such an abstract thing. Rather,\nsuch a theorist will propose a different interpretation of\n‘existence in’ such a world. For example, according to\nPlantinga’s (1973, 1974) version of this account, to say that George\nEliot exists in some possible world in which she is a scientist is\njust to say that there is a (maximal) possible state of affairs such\nthat, had it obtained (i.e., had it been actual), George Eliot would\n(still) have existed, but would have been a scientist. On this\n(deflationary) account of existence in a possible world, it appears\nthat the difficulties that accompany the idea that George Eliot leads\na double life as an element of another concrete universe as well as\nour own (or the idea that she is partially present in many such\nuniverses) are entirely avoided. On Plantinga’s account, to claim that\nan actual object exists in another possible world with somewhat\ndifferent properties amounts to nothing more risqué than the\nclaim that the object could have had somewhat different properties:\nsomething that few will deny. (Note that according to this account, if\nthe actual world is to be one of the possible worlds, then the actual\nworld must be an abstract entity. So, for example, if a merely\npossible world is ‘a way the world might have been’, the\nactual world will be ‘the way the world is’; if a merely\npossible world is a maximal possible state of affairs that is not\ninstantiated, then the actual world will be a maximal possible state\nof affairs that is instantiated. It follows that we must\ndistinguish the actual world qua abstract entity from\n‘the actual world’ in the sense of the collection of\nspatiotemporally linked entities including you and your surroundings\nthat constitutes ‘the universe’ or ‘the\ncosmos’. The sense in which you exist in this concrete universe\n(by being part of it) must be different from the sense in which you\nexist in the abstract state of affairs that is in fact instantiated\n(cf. Stalnaker 1976; van Inwagen 1985, note 3; Kripke 1980,\n19–20).) \nThe discussion so far may suggest that whether the notion of\ntransworld identity (that an object exists in more than one world) is\nproblematic depends solely on whether one adopts an account of\npossible worlds as concrete entities such as Lewis’s (in which case it\nis) or an account of possible worlds as abstract entities such as\nPlantinga’s (in which case it is not). However, it is arguable that\nmatters are not so simple, for a variety of reasons (to be discussed\nin Sections 3–5 below). \nThere may seem to be an obvious objection to the employment of\ntransworld identity to interpret or paraphrase statements such as\n‘Bertrand Russell could have been a playwright’ or\n‘George Eliot might have been a scientist’. A fundamental\nprinciple about (numerical) identity is Leibniz’s Law: the principle\nthat if A is identical with B, then any property of\nA is a property of B, and vice versa. In other\nwords, according to Leibniz’s Law, identity requires the sharing of\nall properties; thus any difference between the properties of\nA and B is sufficient to show that A and\nB are numerically distinct. (The principle here referred to\nas ‘Leibniz’s Law’ is also known as the Indiscernibility\nof Identicals. It must be distinguished from another (more\ncontroversial) Leibnizian principle, the Identity of Indiscernibles,\nwhich says that if A and B share all their\nproperties then A is identical with B.) However, the\nwhole point of asserting a transworld identity is to represent the\nfact that an individual could have had somewhat different\nproperties from its actual properties. Yet does not (for example) the\nclaim that a philosopher in the actual world is identical with a\nnon-philosopher in some other possible world conflict with Leibniz’s\nLaw? \nIt is generally agreed that this objection can be answered, and the\nappearance of conflict with Leibniz’s Law eliminated. We can note that\nthe objection, if sound, would apparently prove too much, since a\nparallel objection would imply that there can be no such thing as\ngenuine (numerical) identity through change of properties over time.\nBut it is generally accepted that no correct interpretation of\nLeibniz’s Law should rule this out. For example, Bertrand Russell was\nthrice married when he received the Nobel Prize for Literature; the\none-year-old Bertrand Russell was, of course, unmarried; does\nLeibniz’s Law force us to deny the identity of the prize-winning adult\nwith the infant, on the grounds that they differ in their properties?\nNo, for it seems that the appearance of conflict with Leibniz’s Law\ncan be dispelled, most obviously by saying that the infant and the\nadult share the properties of being married in 1950 and\nbeing unmarried in 1873, but alternatively by the proposal\nthat the correct interpretation of Leibniz’s Law is that the identity\nof A and B requires that there be no time such that\nA and B have different properties at that\ntime (cf. Loux 1979, 42–43; also Chisholm 1967). However,\nit seems that exactly similar moves are available in the modal case to\naccommodate ‘change’ of properties across possible worlds.\nEither we may claim that the actual Bertrand Russell and the\nplaywright in some possible world (say, w2) are\nalike in possessing the properties of being a philosopher in the\nactual world and being a non-philosopher in\nw2, or we may argue that Leibniz’s Law, properly\ninterpreted, asserts that the identity of A and B\nrequires that there be no time, and no possible world, such that\nA and B have different properties at that time\nand world. The moral appears to be that transworld identity\nclaims (combined with the view that some of an individual’s properties\ncould have been different) need no more be threatened by Leibniz’s Law\nthan is the view that there can be identity over time combined with\nchange of properties (Loux 1979, 42–43). \nIt should be mentioned, however, that David Lewis has argued that the\nreconciliation of identity through change over time with Leibniz’s Law\nsuggested above is oversimplified, and gives rise to a ‘problem\nof temporary intrinsics’ that can be solved only by treating a\npersisting thing that changes over time as composed of temporal parts\nthat do not change their intrinsic properties. (See Lewis 1986,\n202–204, and for discussion and further references, Hawley 2001;\nSider 2001; Lowe 2002; Haslanger 2003.) In addition, it is partly\nbecause Lewis regards the analogous account of transworld identity in\nterms of modal parts as an unacceptable solution to an analogous\n‘problem of accidental intrinsics’ that Lewis rejects\ntransworld identity in favour of counterpart theory (Lewis 1986,\n199–220; cf. Section 1.2 above). \nIn the discussion of transworld identity in the 1960s and 1970s (when\nthe issue came to prominence as a result of developments in modal\nlogic), it was debated whether the notion of transworld identity is\ngenuinely problematic, or whether, on the contrary, the alleged\n‘problem of transworld identity’ is merely a\npseudo-problem. (See Loux 1979, Introduction, Section III; Plantinga\n1973 and 1974, Ch. 6; Kripke 1980 (cf. Kripke 1972); Kaplan 1967/1979;\nKaplan 1975; Chisholm 1967; for further discussion see, for example,\nDivers 2002, Ch. 16; Hughes 2004, Ch. 3; van Inwagen 1985; Lewis 1986,\nCh. 4.) \nIt is difficult to pin down the alleged problem that is supposed to be\nat the heart of this dispute. In particular, although the main\nproponents of the view that the alleged problem is a pseudo-problem\nclearly intended to attack (inter alia) Lewis’s version of\nmodal realism, they did not attempt to rebut the thesis (discussed in\nSection 1.2 above) that if one is a Lewisian realist about\npossible worlds, then one should find transworld identity problematic.\nMatters are complicated by the fact that proponents of the view that\nthe alleged problem of transworld identity is a pseudo-problem were to\nsome extent responding to hypothetical arguments, rather than\narguments presented in print by opponents (see Plantinga 1974, 93).\nHowever, one central issue was whether the claim that an individual\nexists in more than one possible world (and hence that there are cases\nof transworld identity) needs to be backed by the provision of\ncriteria of transworld identity, and, if so, why. \nThe term ‘criterion of identity’ is ambiguous. In an\nepistemological sense, a criterion of identity is a way of telling\nwhether an identity statement is true, or a way of recognizing whether\nan individual A is identical with an individual B.\nHowever, the notion of a criterion of identity also has a metaphysical\ninterpretation, according to which it is a set of (non-trivial)\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for the truth of an identity\nstatement. Although a criterion of identity in the second\n(metaphysical) sense might supply us with a criterion of identity in\nthe first (epistemological) sense, it seems that something could be a\ncriterion of identity in the second sense even if it is unsuited to\nplay the role of a criterion of identity in the first sense. \nThe most influential arguments against the view that there is\na genuine problem of transworld identity (or ‘problem of\ntransworld identification’, to use Kripke’s preferred\nterminology) are probably those presented by Plantinga (1973, 1974)\nand Kripke (1980). Plantinga and Kripke appear to have, as their\ntarget, an alleged problem of transworld identity that rests on one of\nthree assumptions. The first assumption is that we must possess\ncriteria of transworld identity in order to ascertain, on the basis of\ntheir properties in other possible worlds, the identities of (perhaps\nradically disguised) individuals in those worlds. The second\nassumption is that we must possess criteria of transworld identity if\nour references to individuals in other possible worlds are not to miss\ntheir mark. The third assumption is that we must possess criteria of\ntransworld identity in order to understand transworld identity claims.\nAnyone who makes one of these assumptions is likely to think that\nthere is a problem of transworld identity—a problem concerning\nour entitlement to make claims that imply that an individual exists in\nmore than one possible world. For it does not seem that we possess\ncriteria of transworld identity that could fulfil any of these three\nroles. However, Plantinga and Kripke provide reasons for thinking that\nnone of these three assumptions survives scrutiny. If so, and if these\nassumptions exhaust the grounds for supposing that there is a problem\nof transworld identity, the alleged problem may be dismissed as a\npseudo-problem. \nThe three assumptions may be illustrated, using our examples of George\nEliot and Bertrand Russell, as follows. (The examples are alternated\nsimply for the sake of a little variety.) \n(1) The ‘epistemological’ assumption: We must possess a\ncriterion of transworld identity for George Eliot in order to be able\nto tell, on the basis of knowledge of the properties that an\nindividual has in some other possible world, whether that individual\nis identical with Eliot. \n(2) The ‘security of reference’ assumption: We must\npossess a criterion of transworld identity for Bertrand Russell in\norder to know that, when we say such things as ‘There is a\npossible world in which Russell is a playwright’, we are talking\nabout Russell rather than someone else. \n(3) The ‘intelligibility’ assumption: We must possess a\ncriterion of transworld identity for George Eliot in order to\nunderstand the claim that there is a possible world in which she is a\nscientist. \nThe epistemological assumption appears to imply that the point of our\nhaving a criterion of transworld identity for George Eliot would be\nthat we could then employ the criterion in order to ascertain\nwhich individual in a possible world is Eliot; if, on the other hand,\nwe do not possess such a criterion, we shall be unable to pick her out\nor identify her in other possible worlds (Plantinga 1973; 1974, Ch. 6;\nKripke 1980, 42–53; cf. Loux 1979, Introduction; Kaplan\n1967/1979). However, this suggestion, as stated, is vulnerable to the\ncharge that it is the product of confusion. For how could we\nuse a criterion of identity in the way envisaged? We must dismiss as\nfanciful the idea that if we had a criterion of transworld identity\nfor George Eliot, we could use it to tell, by empirical\ninspection of the properties of individuals in other possible\nworlds (perhaps using a powerful telescope (Kripke 1980, 44) or\n‘Jules Verne-o-scope’ (Kaplan 1967/1979, 93; Plantinga\n1974, 94)), which, if any, of those individuals is Eliot. For no one\n(including an extreme realist like Lewis) thinks that our\nepistemological access to other possible worlds is of this kind.\n(According to Lewis, other possible worlds are causally isolated from\nour own, and hence beyond the reach of our telescopes or any other\nperceptual devices.) But once we face up to the fact that a criterion\nof transworld identity (if we had one) could have no such empirical\nuse, the argument based on the epistemological assumption appears to\ncollapse. It is tempting to suggest that the argument is the product\nof the (perhaps surreptitious) influence of a misleading picture of\nour epistemological access to other possible worlds. As Kripke writes\n(using President Nixon as his example): \nOne thinks, in this [mistaken] picture, of a possible world as if it\nwere like a foreign country. One looks upon it as an observer. Maybe\nNixon has moved to the other country and maybe he hasn’t, but one is\ngiven only qualities. One can observe all his qualities, but, of\ncourse, one doesn’t observe that someone is Nixon. One observes that\nsomething has red hair (or green or yellow) but not whether something\nis Nixon. So we had better have a way of telling in terms of\nproperties when we run into the same thing as we saw before; we had\nbetter have a way of telling, when we come across one of these other\npossible worlds, who was Nixon. (1980, 43) \n(It is possible, though, that in this passage Kripke’s principal\ntarget is not a mistaken conception of our epistemological access to\nother possible worlds, but what he takes to be a mistaken\n(‘foreign country’) conception of their nature: a\nconception that (when divorced from the fanciful epistemology) would\nbe entirely appropriate for a Lewisian realist about worlds.) \nIt might be suggested that the point of a criterion of transworld\nidentity is that its possession would enable me to tell which\nindividual I am referring to when I say (for example) ‘There is\na possible world in which Russell is a playwright’. Suppose that\nI am asked: ‘How do you know that the individual you are talking\nabout—this playwright in another possible world—is\nBertrand Russell rather than, say, G. E. Moore, or Marlene Dietrich,\nor perhaps someone who is also a playwright in the actual world, such\nas Tennessee Williams or Aphra Behn? Don’t you need to be able to\nsupply a criterion of transworld identity in order to secure your\nreference to Russell?’ (Cf. Plantinga 1974, 94–97; Kripke\n1980, 44–47.) It seems clear that the right answer to this\nquestion is ‘no’. As Kripke has insisted, it seems\nspurious to suggest that the question how we know which individual we\nare referring to when we make such a claim can be answered only by\ninvoking a criterion of transworld identity. For it seems that we can\nsimply stipulate that the individual in question is Bertrand\nRussell (Kripke 1980, 44). \nSimilarly, perhaps, if I say that there is some past time at which\nAngela Merkel is a baby, and am asked ‘How do you know that it’s\nthe infant Angela Merkel that you are talking about, rather\nthan some other infant?’, an apparently adequate reply is that I\nam stipulating that the past state of affairs I am talking\nabout is one that concerns Merkel (and not some other\nindividual). It seems that I can adequately answer the parallel\nquestion in the modal case by saying that I am stipulating\nthat, when I say that there is some possible world in which Russell is\na playwright, the relevant individual in the possible world (if there\nis one) is Russell (and not some other potential or actual\nplaywright). \nA third job for a criterion of transworld identity might be this: in\norder to understand the claim that there is some possible\nworld in which George Eliot is a scientist, perhaps we must be able to\ngive an informative answer to the question ‘What would it take\nfor a scientist in another possible world to be identical with\nEliot?’ Again, however, it can be argued that this demand is\nillegitimate, at least if what is demanded is that one be able to\nspecify a set of properties whose possession, in another possible\nworld, by an individual in that world, is non-trivially necessary and\nsufficient for being George Eliot (cf. Plantinga 1973; Plantinga 1974,\n94–97; van Inwagen 1985). \nFor one thing, we may point to the fact that it is doubtful that, in\norder to understand the claim that there is some past time at\nwhich Angela Merkel is a baby, we have to be able to answer the\nquestion ‘What does it take for an infant at some past time to\nbe identical with Merkel?’ in any informative way. Secondly, it\nmay be proposed that in order to understand the claim that there is\nsome possible world in which George Eliot is a scientist, we can rely\non our prior understanding of the claim that she might have been a\nscientist (cf. Kripke 1980, 48, note 15; van Inwagen 1985). \nHowever, even if all three of these assumptions can be dismissed as\nbad, or at least inadequate, reasons for supposing that transworld\nidentity requires criteria of transworld identity (and hence for\nsupposing that there is a problem of transworld identity), it does not\nfollow that there are no good reasons for this supposition.\nIn particular, even if the three assumptions are discredited, a fourth\nclaim may survive: \n(4) There must be a criterion of transworld identity for\nRussell (in the sense of a set of properties whose possession by an\nobject in any possible world is non-trivially necessary and sufficient\nfor being Russell) if the claim that there is a possible world in\nwhich Russell is a playwright is to be true. (Such a set of properties\nwould be what is called a non-trivial individual essence of\nRussell, where an individual essence of an individual A is a\nproperty, or set of properties, whose possession by an individual in\nany possible world is both necessary and sufficient for identity with\nA.) \nThat this possibility is left open by the arguments so far considered\nis suggested by at least two points. The first concerns the analogy\ndrawn above between transworld identity and identity through time.\nEven if we can understand the claim that there is some past time at\nwhich Angela Merkel is a baby without being able to specify\ninformative (non-trivial) necessary and sufficient conditions for the\nidentity of the adult Angela Merkel with some previously existing\ninfant, it does not follow that there are no such necessary\nand sufficient conditions. And many philosophers have supposed that\nthere are such conditions for personal identity over time. Secondly,\nthe fact that one may be able to ensure, by stipulation, that one is\ntalking about a possible world in which Bertrand Russell (and\nnot someone else) is a playwright (if there is such a world) does not\nimply that, when making this stipulation, one is not\nimplicitly stipulating that this individual satisfies, in\nthat world, conditions non-trivially necessary and sufficient for\nbeing Russell, even if one is not in a position to say what these\nconditions are. \nThis second point is an extension of the observation that, if (as most\nphilosophers believe) Bertrand Russell has some essential properties\n(properties that he has in all possible worlds in which he exists), to\nstipulate that one is talking about a possible world in which Russell\nis a playwright is, at least implicitly, to stipulate that the\npossible world is one in which someone with Russell’s essential\nproperties is a playwright. For example, according to Kripke’s\n‘necessity of origin’ thesis, human beings have their\nparents essentially (Kripke 1980). If this is correct, then, when we\nsay ‘There is a possible world in which Russell is a\nplaywright’, it seems that, if our stipulation is to be\ncoherent, we must be at least implicitly stipulating that the possible\nworld is one in which someone with Russell’s actual parents\nis a playwright, even if the identity of Russell’s parents is unknown\nto us, and even though we are (obviously) in no position to conduct an\nempirical investigation into the ancestry, in the possible world, of\nthe individuals who exist there. \nThus, it seems, even if Kripke is right in insisting that we need not\nbe able to specify non-trivial necessary and sufficient\nconditions for being Russell in another possible world if we are\nlegitimately to claim that there are possible worlds in which he is a\nplaywright, it might nevertheless be the case that there are\nsuch necessary and sufficient conditions (cf. Kripke 1980, 46–47\nand 18, note 17; Lewis 1986, 222). \nBut what positive reasons are there for holding that transworld\nidentities require non-trivial necessary and sufficient conditions\n(non-trivial individual essences), if arguments that are based on the\nepistemological, security of reference, and intelligibility\nassumptions are abandoned? \nThe principal argument for this view—that transworld identities\nrequire non-trivial individual essences—is that such essences\nare needed in order to avoid what have been called ‘bare\nidentities’ across possible worlds. And some regard bare\nidentities as too high a price to pay for the characterization of\nde re modal statements in terms of transworld identity. If\nthey are right, and if (as many philosophers believe) there are no\nplausible candidates for non-trivial individual essences (at least for\nsuch things as people, cats, trees, and tables) there is, indeed, a\nserious problem about transworld identity. (The expression ‘bare\nidentities’ is taken from Forbes 1985. The notion, as used here,\nis approximately the same as the notion of ‘primitive\nthisness’ employed by Adams (1979), although Adams’s notion is\nthat of an identity that does not supervene on qualitative facts,\nrather than an identity that does not supervene on any other facts at\nall.) \nSuppose that we combine transworld identity with the claim (without\nwhich the introduction of transworld identity seems pointless) that a\ntransworld identity can hold between A in\nw1 and B in w2 even\nthough the properties that B has in w2\nare somewhat different from the properties that A has in\nw1 (or, to put it more simply, suppose that we\ncombine the claim that there are transworld identities with the claim\nthat not all of a thing’s properties are essential to it). Then, it\ncan be argued, unless there are non-trivial individual essences, we\nare in danger of having to admit the existence of possible worlds that\ndiffer from one another only in the identities of some of the\nindividuals that they contain. \nOne such argument, adapted from Chisholm 1967, goes as follows. Taking\nAdam and Noah in the actual world as our examples (and pretending, for\nthe sake of the example, that the biblical characters are real\npeople), then, on the plausible assumption that not all of their\nproperties are essential to them, it seems that there is a possible\nworld in which Adam is a little more like the actual Noah than he\nactually was, and Noah a little more like the actual Adam than he\nactually was. But if there is such a world, then it seems that there\nshould be a further world in which Adam is yet more like the actual\nNoah, and Noah yet more like the actual Adam. Proceeding in this way,\nit looks as if we may arrive ultimately at a possible world that is\nexactly like the actual world, except that Adam and Noah have\n‘switched roles’ (plus any further differences that follow\nlogically from this, such as the fact that in the\n‘role-switching’ world Eve is the consort of a man who\nplays the Adam role, but is in fact Noah). But if this can happen with\nAdam and Noah, then it seems that it could happen with any two actual\nindividuals. For example, it looks as if there will be a possible\nworld that is a duplicate of the actual world except for the fact that\nin this world you play the role that Queen Victoria plays in\nthe actual world, and she plays the role that you play in the\nactual world (cf. Chisholm 1967, p. 83 in 1979). But this may seem\nintolerable. Is it really the case that Queen Victoria could have had\nall your actual properties (except for identity with you)\nwhile you had all of hers (except for identity with her)? \nHowever, if one thinks that such conclusions are intolerable, how are\nthey to be avoided? The obvious answer is that what is needed, in the\nAdam-Noah case, is that the roles played by Adam and Noah in the\nactual world include some properties that are essential to their\nbearers’ being Adam and Noah respectively: that Adam and Noah differ\nnon-trivially in their essential properties as well as in\ntheir accidental properties: more precisely, that Adam has some\nessential property that Noah essentially lacks, or vice versa. For if\n‘the Adam role’ includes some property that Noah\nessentially lacks, then, of course, there is no possible world in\nwhich Noah has that property, in which case the Adam role (in all its\ndetail) is not a possible role for Noah, and the danger of a\nrole-switching world such as the one described above is avoided. \nThe supposition that Adam and Noah differ in their essential\nproperties in this way, although sufficient to block the generation of\nthis example of a role-switching world, does not by itself imply that\neach of Adam and Noah has an individual essence: a set of\nessential properties whose possession is (not only necessary but also)\nsufficient for being Adam or Noah. Suppose that Adam has, as one of\nhis essential properties, living in the Garden of Eden, whereas Noah\nessentially lacks this property. This will block the possibility of\nNoah’s playing the Adam role, although it does not, by itself, imply\nthat nothing other than Adam could play that role. However,\nwhen we reflect on the potential generality of the argument, it\nappears that, if we are to block all cases of role-switching\nconcerning actual individuals, we must suppose that every actual\nindividual has some essential property (or set of essential\nproperties) that every other actual individual essentially lacks. For\nexample, to block all cases of role-switching concerning Adam and\nother actual individuals, there must be some component of ‘the\nAdam role’ that is not only essential to being Adam, but also\ncannot be played, in any possible world, by any actual individual\nother than Adam. \nEven if we suppose that all actual individuals are distinguished from\none another by such ‘distinctive’ essential properties,\nthis still does not, strictly speaking, imply that they have\nindividual essences. For example, it does not rule out the existence\nof a possible world that is exactly like the actual world except that,\nin this possible world, the Adam role is played, not by Adam, but by\nsome merely possible individual (distinct from all actual\nindividuals). However, if we find intolerable the idea that there are\nsuch possible worlds—worlds that, like the role-switching world,\ndiffer from the actual world only in the identities of some of the\nindividuals that they contain—then, it seems, we must suppose\nthat individuals like Adam (and Noah and you) have (non-trivial)\nindividual essences, where an individual essence of Adam is (by\ndefinition) some property (or set of properties) that is both\nessential to being Adam and also such that it is not possessed, in any\npossible world, by any individual other than Adam—i.e., an\nessential property (or set of properties) that guarantees that its\npossessor is Adam and no one else. \nChisholm (1967) arrives at his role-switching world by a series of\nsteps. Thus his argument appears to rely on the combination of the\ntransitivity of identity (across possible worlds) with the assumption\nthat a succession of small changes can add up to a big change. And\n‘Chisholm’s Paradox’ (as it is called) is sometimes\nregarded as relying crucially on these assumptions, suggesting that it\nhas the form of a sorites paradox (the type of paradox that\ngenerates, from apparently impeccable assumptions, such absurd\nconclusions as that a man with a million hairs on his head is bald).\n(See, for example, Forbes 1985, Ch. 7.) \nHowever, there are versions of the role-switching argument that do not\nrely on the cumulative effect of a series of small changes. Suppose we\nassume that Adam and Noah do not differ from one another in their\nessential properties; in other words, that all the differences between\nthem are accidental (i.e., contingent) differences. It seems\nimmediately to follow that any way that Adam could have been is a way\nthat Noah could have been, and vice versa. But one way that Adam could\nhave been is the way Adam actually is, and one way that Noah could\nhave been is the way Noah actually is. So (if Adam and Noah do not\ndiffer in their essential properties) it seems that there is a\npossible world in which Adam plays the Noah role, and a possible world\nin which Noah plays the Adam role. But there is no obvious reason why\na world in which Adam plays the Noah role and a world in which Noah\nplays the Adam role shouldn’t be the very same world. And in that case\nthere is a possible world in which Adam and Noah have swapped their\nroles. This argument for the generation of a role-switching world does\nnot rely on a series of small changes: all that it requires is the\nassumption that there is no essential difference between Noah and\nAdam: or, to put it another way, that any essential property of Noah\nis also an essential property of Adam, and vice versa. (See Mackie\n2006, Ch. 2; also Adams 1979.) \nAnother type of argument for the conclusion that unless things have\nnon-trivial individual essences there will be ‘bare’\ntransworld identities: identities that do not supervene on (are not\ngrounded in) other facts, is presented by Graeme Forbes. (Strictly\nspeaking, Forbes is concerned to avoid identities that are not\ngrounded in what he calls ‘intrinsic’ properties.) A\nsketch of a type of argument used by Forbes is this. (What follows is\nbased on Forbes 1985, Ch. 6; see also Mackie 2006, Ch. 3.) Suppose (as\nis surely plausible) that an actually existing oak tree could have\nbeen different in some respects from the way that it is; suppose also\nthat, even if it has some essential properties (perhaps it is\nessentially an oak tree, for example), it has no non-trivial\nindividual essence consisting in some set of its intrinsic properties.\nThen there is the danger that there may be three possible worlds (call\nthem ‘w2’,\n‘w3’, and\n‘w4’), where in w2\nthere is an oak tree that is identical with the original tree\n(w2 representing one way in which the tree could\nhave been different), and in w3 there is an oak\ntree that is identical with the original tree (w3\nrepresenting another way in which the tree could have been different),\nand in w4 there are two oak trees, one of\nwhich is an intrinsic duplicate of the tree as it is in\nw2, and the other an intrinsic duplicate of the\ntree as it is in w3. If all of\nw2, w3, and\nw4 are possible, then, given that at least one of\nthe trees in w4 is not identical with the original\ntree (since two things cannot be identical with one thing) there are\ninstances of transworld identity (and transworld distinctness)\nconcerning a tree in one possible world and a tree in another that are\nnot grounded in (do not supervene on) the intrinsic features that\nthose trees possess in those possible worlds. For example, suppose\nthat, of the two trees in w4, the intrinsic\nduplicate of the w2 tree is not identical\nwith the original tree. Then, obviously, the distinctness\n(non-identity) between this w4 tree and the tree\nin w2 is not grounded in the intrinsic features\nthat the trees have in w2 and\nw4—and nor is the identity between the tree\nin w2 and the original tree grounded in the\nintrinsic features that the tree has in w2 and in\nthe actual world. \nForbes argues that, in order to avoid this (and similar) consequences,\nwe should suppose that (contrary to the second assumption used in\nsetting up the ‘reduplication argument’ sketched above)\nthe oak tree does have a non-trivial individual essence\nconsisting in some of its intrinsic properties, and his favoured\ncandidate for its essence is one that includes the tree’s coming from\nthe particular acorn from which it actually originated. If the tree\ndoes have such an ‘intrinsic’ individual essence, then,\nif w2 and w3 are both\npossible, each of them must contain a tree that has (in that world)\nintrinsic properties that are guaranteed to be sufficient for\nidentity with the original tree, in which case (as a matter of logic)\nthere can be no world such as w4 that contains\nintrinsic duplicates of both of them. (See Forbes 1985, Ch. 6, and,\nfor discussion, Mackie 1987; Mackie 2006; Robertson 1998; Yablo 1988;\nChihara 1998; Della Rocca 1996; further discussions by Forbes include\nhis 1986, 1994, and 2002.) \nFinally, it is obvious that the structure of Forbes’s argument has\nnothing to do with the fact that the chosen example is a tree.\nForbes’s ‘reduplication argument’ therefore appears to\npose a general problem for the characterization of de re\nmodal statements about individuals in terms of transworld identity:\neither we must admit that their transworld identities can be\n‘bare’, or we must find non-trivial individual essences,\nbased on their intrinsic properties, that can ground their identities\nacross possible worlds. \nSo far it has been assumed that (non-trivial) necessary and sufficient\nconditions for transworld identity with a given object would involve\nthe possession, by that object, of an individual essence: a set of\nproperties that it carries with it in every possible world in which it\nexists. But one might wonder why we should make this assumption. Those\nwho believe that there are (non-trivial) necessary and sufficient\nconditions for identity over time need not, and almost universally do\nnot, believe that these conditions consist in the possession, by an\nobject, of some ‘omnitemporal core’ (to use a phrase\nsuggested by Harold Noonan) that it has at every time in its\nexistence. So why should things be different in the modal case? \nThe obvious answer seems to be this. In the case of identity over\ntime, we can appeal to relations (other than mere similarity) between\nthe states of an individual at different times in its existence. For\nexample, it looks as if we can say that the adult Russell is identical\nwith the infant Russell in virtue of the existence of certain\nspatiotemporal and causal continuities between his infant state in\n1873 and his adult state in (say) 1950 that are characteristic of the\ncontinued existence of a human being. But no such relations of\ncontinuity are available to ground identities across possible worlds\n(cf. Quine 1976). \nHowever, on reflection, it may seem that this is too swift. If we\nsuppose that any possible history for Russell is a possible\nspatiotemporal and causal extension of the state that he was actually\nin at some time in his existence, then perhaps we may appeal to the\nsame continuities that ground his identity over time in the actual\nworld in order to ground his identity across possible worlds (cf.\nBrody 1980, 114–115; 121). For example, perhaps to say that\nRussell could have been a playwright is to say that there was some\ntime in his actual existence at which he could have become a\nplaywright. If so, then perhaps we can hold that for a playwright in a\npossible world to be identical with Russell is for that playwright to\nhave, in that world, a life that is, at some early stage, exactly the\nsame as Russell’s actual life at some early stage, but which develops\nfrom that point, in the spatiotemporally and causally continuous\nfashion that is characteristic of the continued existence of a human\nbeing, into the career of a playwright rather than that of a\nphilosopher. However, although such a conception may seem initially\nattractive, it runs into difficulties if it is intended to provide\nconditions that are genuinely both necessary and sufficient for the\nidentity of individuals across possible worlds. These difficulties\ninclude the fact that it seems too much to demand that Russell have\nexactly the same early history (or origin) as his actual\nearly history (or origin) in every possible world in which he exists.\nYet if Russell’s early history could have been different in certain\nrespects, we face the question: ‘In virtue of what is an\nindividual in another possible world with a slightly\ndifferent early history from Russell’s actual early history\nidentical with Russell?’—a question of precisely the type\nthat the provision of necessary and sufficient conditions for\ntransworld identity was intended to answer. (For discussion of this\n‘branching’ conception of possibilities, and its\nimplications for questions of transworld identity and essential\nproperties, see Brody 1980, Ch. 5; Mackie 1998; Mackie 2006, Chs\n6–7; Coburn 1986, Section VI; McGinn 1976; Mackie 1974; Prior\n1960.) \nThe fact that, in the absence of non-trivial individual essences, a\ntransworld identity characterization of de re modal\nstatements appears to generate bare identities (via arguments such as\nChisholm’s Paradox or Forbes’s reduplication argument) may produce a\nvariety of reactions. \nThe moral that Chisholm (1967) drew from his argument was scepticism\nabout transworld identity, based partly on scepticism about whether\nthe non-trivial individual essences that would block the generation of\nrole-switching worlds are available. Others would go further, and\nconclude that such puzzles provide not only a reason for rejecting\ntransworld identity, but also a reason for adopting counterpart\ntheory. (Note, though, that Lewis’s reasons for adopting counterpart\ntheory appear to be largely independent of such puzzles (cf. Lewis\n1986, Ch. 4).) A third reaction is to accept bare\nidentities—or, at least, to accept that individuals (including\nactual individuals) may have qualitative duplicates in other possible\nworlds, and that transworld identities may involve what have been\ncalled ‘haecceitistic’ differences. (See Adams 1979;\nMackie 2006, Chs 2–3; Lewis 1986, Ch. 4, Section 4; also the\nseparate entry on Haecceitism.) A fourth reaction, that of Forbes, is\nto propose a mixed solution: he holds that for some individuals\n(including human beings and trees) suitable candidates for non-trivial\nindividual essences can be found (by appeal to distinctive features of\ntheir origins), although for others (including most artefacts) it may\nbe that no suitable candidates are available, in which case\ncounterpart theory should be adopted for these cases (see Forbes 1985,\nChs 6–7). \nIt is perhaps significant, though, that no theorist appears to have\nargued that a ‘non-trivial individual essence’ solution\ncan be applied to all the relevant cases. In other words, the\nconsensus appears to be that the price of interpreting all\nde re modal claims in terms of transworld identity (as\nopposed to counterpart theory) is the acceptance of bare identities\nacross possible worlds. \nFinally, it can be noted that the problems concerning transworld\nidentity discussed here arise only because it is assumed that not all\nof an individual’s properties are essential to it (and hence that, if\nit exists in more than one possible world, it has different properties\nin different worlds). If, instead, one were to hold that all\nof an individual’s properties are essential properties—and\nhence, for example, that George Eliot could not have existed with\nproperties in any way different from her actual ones—then no\nsuch problems would arise. Moreover, this suggestion, implausible\nthough it may be, is of some historical interest. For, according to a\nstandard interpretation of the views of Gottfried Leibniz, the\nphilosopher who is the father of theories of possible worlds,\nLeibniz’s theory of ‘complete individual notions’ commits\nhim to the thesis that an individual such as George Eliot\ndoes have all her properties essentially (cf. Leibniz,\nDiscourse on Metaphysics (1687), Sections 8 and 13; printed\nin Leibniz 1973 and elsewhere). According to the\n‘hyper-essentialist’ view to which Leibniz appears to be\ncommitted, any individual, in any possible world, whose properties in\nthat world differ from the actual properties of George Eliot is not,\nstrictly speaking, identical with Eliot. However, it also seems clear\nthat this does not represent a way of saving a transworld identity\ninterpretation of de re modality. On the contrary: if there\nis no possible world in which George Eliot exists with properties\ndifferent from her actual properties, then it is plausible to conclude\nthat there is no possible world, other than the actual world, in which\nshe exists at all. For unless possible worlds can be exact duplicates\n(something that Leibniz himself would deny), any merely possible world\nmust differ from the actual world in some respect. If so, then the\nproperties of any individual in another possible world must differ in\nsome respect from the actual properties of Eliot (even if the\ndifference is only a difference in relational properties), in which\ncase, if all Eliot’s properties are essential to her, that individual\nis not Eliot. (Leibniz’s views may, however, be seen as a partial\nanticipation of counterpart theory, which attempts to save the truth\nof the claim that George Eliot could have been different in\nsome respects (thus denying ‘hyper-essentialism’) while\npreserving the metaphysical thesis that no individual who is, strictly\nspeaking, identical with Eliot exists in any other possible world (cf.\nKripke 1980, 45, note 13).) \nThe view that an individual’s transworld identity is\n‘bare’ is sometimes described as the view that its\nidentity consists in its possession of a ‘haecceity’ or\n‘thisness’: an unanalysable non-qualitative property that\nis necessary and sufficient for its being the individual that it is.\n(The term ‘individual essence’ is sometimes used to denote\nsuch a haecceity. It should be noted that according to the terminology\nused in this article, although a haecceity would be an individual\nessence, it would not be a non-trivial individual essence.)\nHowever, it is not obvious that the belief in bare identities requires\nthe acceptance of haecceities. One can apparently hold that transworld\nidentities may be ‘bare’ without holding that they are\nconstituted by any properties at all, even unanalysable haecceities\n(cf. Lewis 1986, 225; Adams 1979, 6–7). Thus we should\ndistinguish what is standardly known as ‘haecceitism’\n(roughly, the view that there may be bare identities across possible\nworlds in the sense of identities that do not supervene on qualitative\nproperties) from the belief in haecceities (the belief that\nindividuals have unanalysable non-qualitative properties that\nconstitute their being the individuals that they are). (For more on\nthe use of the term ‘haecceitism’ see Lewis 1986, Ch. 4,\nSection 4; Adams 1979; Kaplan 1975, Section IV; also the separate\nentry on Haecceitism. For the history of the term\n‘haecceity’, see the entry on Medieval Theories of\nHaecceity.) \nIn addition, it should be noted that to believe in ‘bare’\ntransworld identities, in the sense under discussion here, is not to\nbelieve in ‘bare particulars’, if to be a bare particular\nis to be an entity devoid of (non-trivial) essential properties. As\nthe arguments discussed in Sections 4.1–4.2 above demonstrate, a\ncommitment to a ‘bare’ (or ‘ungrounded’)\ndifference in the identities of two individuals A and\nB in different possible worlds (two human beings, or two\ntrees, for example) does not imply that those individuals have no\nnon-trivial essential properties. All it implies is that A\nand B do not differ in their non-trivial essential\nproperties—and hence that, although there may well be\nnon-trivial necessary conditions for being A in any possible\nworld, and non-trivial necessary conditions for being B in\nany possible world, there are no non-trivial necessary conditions for\nbeing A that are not also necessary conditions for being\nB, and vice versa. (Cf. Adams’s ‘Moderate\nHaecceitism’ (1979, 24–26).) \nIt was argued above that the proponent of transworld identity without\nnon-trivial individual essences faces the prospect of bare\n(‘ungrounded’) identities across possible worlds. One such\nargument is Chisholm’s Paradox, which relies on the transitivity of\nidentity to produce the result that a series of small changes in the\nproperties of Adam and Noah leads to a world in which Adam and Noah\nhave swapped their roles. However, the transitivity of identity\ngenerates additional problems concerning transworld identity, some of\nwhich have nothing particularly to do with role-switching\npossibilities or bare identities. \nOne such argument is given by Chandler (1976). It can be illustrated\nsimply as follows (adapting Chandler’s own example). Suppose that\nthere is a bicycle originally composed of three parts: A1, B1, and C1.\n(We might suppose that A1 is the frame, and B1 and C1 the two wheels.)\nSuppose we think that any bicycle could have been originally composed\nof any two thirds of its original parts, with a substitute third\ncomponent. We may call this (following Forbes 1985) ‘the\ntolerance principle’; it is a development of the intuitively\nappealing thought that it is too much to demand, of an object such as\na bicycle, that it could not have existed unless all of its\noriginal parts had been the same. Suppose, further, that we think that\nno bicycle could have been originally composed of just one third of\nits original parts, even with substitutes for the other two thirds.\nCall this ‘the restriction principle’. The combination of\nthese assumptions generates a difficulty for the paraphrase of de\nre modal claims about bicycles in terms of transworld identity.\nFor if there is (as the tolerance principle allows) a possible world\nw2 in which our bicycle comes into existence\ncomposed of parts A1 + B1 + C2, where C1 ≠ C2, then, if we apply\nthe tolerance principle to this bicycle we must say that\nit could have come into existence (in some further possible\nworld w3) with any two thirds of those\nparts, with a substitute third component: for example, that it could\nhave come into existence (in w3) composed of A1 + B2 + C2,\nwhere B1 ≠ B2 and C1 ≠ C2. The bicycle in w3\nis, ex hypothesi, identical with the bicycle in\nw2, and the bicycle in w2 is,\nex hypothesi, identical with the original bicycle; so, by the\ntransitivity of identity, the bicycle in w3 is\nidentical with the original bicycle. Hence our assumptions have\ngenerated a contradiction. We have a bicycle in\nw3, originally composed of A1 + B2 + C2, that both\nis identical with the original bicycle (by the repeated application of\nthe tolerance principle, together with the transitivity of identity)\nand is not identical with the original bicycle (by the restriction\nprinciple). \nOne might complain that the version of the tolerance principle cited\nabove is too lenient. Perhaps it is not true that the bicycle could\nhave come into existence with just two thirds of its original\ncomponents: perhaps a threshold of, say, 90% or more is required.\nHowever, the simple argument given above can obviously be adapted to\ngenerate a contradiction between the restriction principle and any\ntolerance principle that permits some difference in the\nbicycle’s original composition, simply by introducing a longer chain\nof possible worlds. Thus the transitivity argument appears to force\nthe proponent of transworld identity to choose between two implausible\nclaims: that an object such as a bicycle has all of its original parts\nessentially (thus denying any version of the tolerance principle) and\nthat an object such as a bicycle could have come into existence with\nfew (if any) of its original parts (thus denying any (non-trivial)\nversion of the restriction principle). Moreover, it is clear that the\nproblem can be generalized to any object to which versions of the\ntolerance principle and the restriction principle concerning its\noriginal material composition have application, which appears to\ninclude all artefacts, if not biological organisms. \nIt seems legitimate to call this puzzle a ‘problem of transworld\nidentity’, for it turns partly on the transitivity of identity,\nand can be avoided by interpreting claims about how bicycles could\nhave been different (de re modal claims about bicycles) in\nterms of a counterpart relation that is not transitive (Chandler\n1976). Thus a counterpart theorist may admit that the bicycle could\nhave been originally composed of A1 + B1 + C2 rather than A1 + B1 +\nC1, on the grounds that (according to the tolerance principle) it has\na counterpart (in w2) that is originally so\ncomposed. And the counterpart theorist may admit that a bicycle (such\nas the one in w2) that is originally composed of\nA1 + B1 + C2 could have been originally composed of A1 + B2 + C2,\nsince (by the tolerance principle) it has a counterpart (in\nw3) that is originally so composed. However, since\nthe counterpart relation (unlike identity) is not transitive, the\ncounterpart theorist need not say that the bicycle in\nw3 that is originally composed of A1 + B2 + C2 is\na counterpart of the bicycle in the actual world\n(w1) originally composed of A1 + B1 + C1, for its\nsimilarity to the bicycle in w1 may be\ninsufficient to allow it to be that bicycle’s counterpart. Thus the\nnon-transitivity of the counterpart relation (a relation based on\nresemblance) appears neatly to allow the counterpart theorist to\nrespect both the tolerance principle and the restriction principle,\nwithout falling into contradiction. \nOne reaction to the transitivity puzzle is to abandon transworld\nidentity in favour of counterpart theory. But how—given the\nstructure of the puzzle—can the theorist who wishes to resist\nthat move, and retain transworld identity, respond? \nOne response would be to give up any non-trivial version of the\nrestriction principle, and hold that an artefact such as a bicycle\ncould have come into existence with an entirely different material\ncomposition from its actual original composition. Although this\ncountereintuitive view has been defended (for example, Mackie (2006)\nargues for it on grounds independent of the transitivity problem), it\nhas few adherents. \nA second response would be to give up the tolerance principle, and\nadopt what Roca-Royes (2016) calls an ‘inflexible’ version\nof the principle that the material origin of an artefact is essential\nto it, holding that an artefact such as a bicycle could not have come\ninto existence with a material composition in any way different from\nits actual original composition. Although this view is admittedly\ncounterintuitive, Roca-Royes argues that it provides the best solution\nto the ‘Four Worlds Paradox’ to be discussed in the next\nsection. (It can be noted that this transitivity problem—perhaps\nunlike Chisholm’s Paradox—has no obvious solution that appeals\nto non-trivial individual essences that does not include the claim\nthat a bicycle’s individual essence involves its having absolutely all\nits original parts, thus rejecting the tolerance principle.) \nA third solution to the transitivity problem has been proposed (by\nChandler, followed by Salmon) which apparently allows us to reconcile\nall three of the transitivity of identity, the tolerance principle,\nand the restriction principle. This is to say that although there\nare possible worlds (such as w3) in which\nthe bicycle is originally composed of only a small proportion of its\nactual original parts, such worlds are not possible relative to (not\n‘accessible to’) the initial world w1.\nFrom the standpoint of w1, such an original\ncomposition for the bicycle is only possibly possible: something that\nwould have been possible, had things been different in some possible\nway, but is not, as things are, possible (Chandler 1976; Salmon 1979;\nSalmon 1982, 238–240). Whether this solution is satisfactory is\ndisputed. Admittedly, there are some contexts in which we talk of\npossibility in a way that may suggest that the ‘accessibility\nrelation’ between possible worlds is non-transitive: that not\neverything that would have been possible, had things been different in\nsome possible way, is possible simpliciter. (If Ann had\nstarted writing her paper earlier, it would have been possible for her\nto finish it today. And she could have started writing her\npaper earlier. But, as things are, it is not possible for her to\nfinish it today.) Nevertheless, the idea that, as regards the type of\nmetaphysical possibility that is involved in puzzles such as that of\nthe bicycle, there might be states of affairs that are possibly\npossible and yet not possible (and hence that de re\nmetaphysical possibility and necessity do not obey the system of modal\nlogic known as S4) is regarded with suspicion by many\nphilosophers. \nIt should be noted that the ‘non-transitivity of\naccessibility’ response is distinct from an even more radical\nresponse, which rejects the principle of the transitivity of\nidentity—a principle definitive of the classical notion of\nidentity. For example, Priest (2010) denies the transitivity of\nidentity in the context of his dialetheism about truth and a\nparaconsistent logic in which the material conditional does not obey\nthe principle of modus ponens. Discussion of this extreme\nposition is, however, beyond the scope of this article. (On\ndialetheism and paraconsistent logic, see the separate entry on\nDialetheism. On the logic of identity, see the entry on Identity.) \nIt is fair to say that there is no consensus about how the proponent\nof transworld identity should respond to the transitivity problem\nposed by Chandler’s example. \nChandler’s transitivity argument can be adapted to produce a puzzle\nthat is like those discussed in Sections 4.1–4.2 above in that\nit involves the danger of ‘bare identities’, a puzzle that\nSalmon (1982) has called ‘The Four Worlds Paradox’. To\nillustrate the puzzle: suppose that the actual world\n(w1) contains a bicycle, a, that is\n(actually) originally composed of A1 + B1 + C1, and suppose that there\nis a possible world, w5, containing a bicycle,\nb (not identical with a), that is originally\ncomposed (in w5) of A2 + B2 + C1 (where A1 ≠ A2\nand B1 ≠ B2). Then, it seems, the application of the tolerance\nprinciple to each of a and b may generate two\nfurther possible worlds, in one of which (w6)\nthere is a bicycle with the original composition A1 + B2 + C1 that is\nidentical with a, and in the other of which\n(w7) there is a bicycle with the original\ncomposition A1 + B2 + C1 that is identical with b. Since\nthere need apparently be no further difference between the intrinsic\nfeatures of w6 and w7 on which\nthis difference in identities could depend, we appear to have a case\nof bare identities. This ‘Four Worlds Paradox’ is like\nChandler’s original transitivity puzzle in that it does not seem that\nan appeal to individual essences could solve it without conflicting\nwith the tolerance principle. If so, the proponent of transworld\nidentity (as opposed to counterpart theory) appears to be left with\ntwo options consistent with the transitivity of identity: the denial\nof the tolerance principle, and the acceptance of bare identities. It\nmay be argued, however, that the acceptance of bare identities can be\nmade more palatable in this case by the adoption of a non-transitive\naccessibility relation between possible worlds. (See Salmon 1982,\n230–252; and, for discussion, Roca-Royes 2016. For a defence of\nthe employment of counterpart theory to solve the Four Worlds Paradox,\nsee Forbes 1985, Ch. 7. For discussion of a radical response that\nretains the tolerance principle and yet avoids bare identities, but\nonly at the cost of claiming that two bicycles could completely\ncoincide in one possible world, simultaneously sharing all their\nparts, see Roca-Royes 2016, discussing Williamson 1990. On the\nrelevance to the Four Worlds Paradox to Kripke’s principle of the\nnecessity (essentiality) of origin for artefacts, see also Robertson\n1998 and Hawthorne and Gendler 2000.) \nOne of our initial questions (Section 1 above) was whether a\ncommitment to transworld identity—the view that an individual\nexists in more than one possible world—is an acceptable\ncommitment for one who believes in possible worlds. The considerations\nof Sections 4–5 above suggest that this commitment does involve\ngenuine (although perhaps not insuperable) problems, even for one who\nrejects David Lewis’s extreme realism about the nature of possible\nworlds. The problems do not arise directly from the notion of\nan individual’s existing in more than one possible world with\ndifferent properties. Rather, they derive principally from the fact\nthat it is hard to accommodate all that we want to say about the modal\nproperties of ordinary individuals (including all the things we want\nto say about their essential and accidental properties) if de\nre modal statements about such individuals are characterized in\nterms of their existence or non-existence in other possible\nworlds. \nThere is currently no consensus about the appropriate resolution of\nthese problems. In particular, there is no consensus about whether the\nadoption of counterpart theory is superior to the solutions available\nto a transworld identity theorist. A full examination of the issue\nwould require a discussion of the objections that have been raised\nagainst counterpart theory as an interpretation of de re\nmodality. And a detailed discussion of counterpart theory is beyond\nthe scope of this article. (For David Lewis’s presentation of\ncounterpart theory, the reader might start with Lewis 1973,\n39–43, followed by (the more technical) Lewis 1968. Early\ncriticisms of Lewis’s counterpart theory include those in Kripke 1980;\nPlantinga 1973; and Plantinga 1974, Ch. 6. Lewis develops the 1968\nversion of his counterpart theory in Lewis 1971 and 1986, Ch. 4; he\nresponds to criticisms in his “Postscripts to ‘Counterpart\nTheory and Quantified Modal Logic’” (1983, 39–46)\nand in Lewis 1986, Ch. 4. Other discussions of counterpart theory\ninclude Hazen 1979, the relevant sections of Divers 2002, Melia 2003,\nand the more technical treatment in Forbes 1985. More recent critiques\nof the theory (postdating Lewis’s 1986 response to his critics)\ninclude Fara and Williamson 2005 and Fara 2009.) \nOne way to argue in favour of transworld identity (distinct from the\ndefensive strategies discussed in Sections 4 and 5 above) is what we\nmight call ‘the argument from logical simplicity’ (Linsky\nand Zalta 1994, 1996; Williamson 1998, 2000). The argument begins by\nnoting that Quantified Modal Logic—which combines individual\nquantifiers and modal operators—is greatly simplified when one\naccepts the validity of the Barcan scheme,\n∀x□A → □∀xA\n(Marcus 1946). The resulting logic is sound and complete with respect\nto constant domain semantics, in which each possible world\nhas precisely the same set of individuals in its domain. The simplest\nphilosophical interpretation of this semantics is that one and the\nsame individual exists at every possible world. \nSeveral remarks on this argument are in order. First, its conclusion\nis very strong: it says that any entity that in fact exists or that\ncould have existed exists necessarily. There is no contingent\nexistence. This goes far beyond the claim that there are genuine\nidentities across worlds. (Williamson (2002) defends this conclusion\non independent grounds.) Second, the argument does not offer an\nexplanation of how transworld identities are possible; it insists only\nthat there are genuine transworld identities. (Nevertheless, the\nmetaphysical picture that can most naturally be ‘read off’\nthe constant-domain semantics treats properties-at-a-world as\nrelations between particulars and worlds, as on McDaniel’s modal\nrealism with overlap (McDaniel 2004), discussed in Section 1.2\nabove.)  \nThird, the argument is not best understood as the claim that, if one\ndoes not accept transworld identities, then one is forced\ninto denying the Barcan scheme (and hence forced into uncomfortable\nlogical territory). That claim would be true only if the Barcan scheme\nwere validated only by constant-domain semantics, which is\nnot the case. Counterpart-theoretic semantics can be restricted so as\nto validate the Barcan scheme, by insisting that the counterpart\nrelation is an equivalence relation which, for each particular\nx and world w, relates x to a unique\nparticular in w. (One could not then interpret the\ncounterpart relation in terms of similarity, as Lewis does.) Rather,\nthe argument should be understood as the claim that the best way to\ngain the advantages of a logic containing the Barcan scheme is by\nadopting constant-domain semantics (and genuine transworld identities\nalong with it). But just which metaphysical view counts as\n‘best’ here will involve a trade-off between many factors.\nThese include the simplicity of the constant-domain semantics, on the\none hand, but also arguments of the kind raised by Lewis against modal\nrealism with overlap, on the other. \nFinally, we can note that Lewis (1986) has presented a challenge to\nthe self-styled champions of ‘transworld identity’ to\nexplain why the view that they insist on deserves to be\ncalled a commitment to transworld identity at all. \nThroughout this article, it has been assumed that a commitment to\ntransworld identity may be differentiated from a commitment to\ncounterpart theory on the grounds that the transworld identity\ntheorist accepts, while the counterpart theorist denies, that an\nobject exists in more than one possible world (cf. Section\n1.2 above). However, as Lewis points out, there is a notion of\n‘existence according to a (possible) world’ that\nis completely neutral as between a counterpart-theoretic and a\n‘transworld identity’ interpretation. In terms of this\nneutral conception, as long as the counterpart theorist and transworld\nidentity theorist agree that Bertrand Russell could have been a\nplaywright instead of a philosopher, they must agree that Russell\nexists according to more than one world. In particular, they\nmust agree that, according to our world, he exists and is a\nphilosopher, and according to some other worlds, he exists\nand is a non-philosopher playwright (cf. Lewis 1986, 194). The\ndifference between the theorists, then, allegedly consists in their\ndifferent interpretations of what it is for Russell to exist\n‘according to’ a world. In the view of the counterpart\ntheorist, for Russell to exist according to a possible world in which\nhe is a playwright is for him to have a counterpart in that\nworld who is (in that world) a playwright. According to the transworld\nidentity theorist, it is supposed to be for Russell (himself) to\nexist in that world as a playwright. \nIf the transworld identity theorist were a Lewisian realist about\npossible worlds, this notion of existence in a world could be\nclearly distinguished from the neutral notion of existence\naccording to a world, on the grounds that the existence of\nRussell in a world would require his complete or partial presence as a\npart of such a world (cf. Section 1.2 above). But, as Lewis notes, the\nself-styled champions of ‘transworld identity’ who oppose\nhis counterpart theory are philosophers who repudiate a Lewisian\nrealist conception of what it takes for Russell to exist in more than\none possible world. Hence, he argues, there is a question about their\nentitlement to claim that, according to their theory, Russell exists\nin other possible worlds in any sense that goes beyond the\nneutral thesis (compatible with counterpart theory) that Russell\nexists according to other worlds. Thus Lewis writes (using\nthe 1968 US presidential candidate Hubert Humphrey as his\nexample): \nThe philosophers’ chorus on behalf of ‘trans-world\nidentity’ is merely insisting that, for instance, it is Humphrey\nhimself who might have existed under other conditions, … who\nmight have won the presidency, who exists according to many worlds and\nwins according to some of them. All that is uncontroversial. The\ncontroversial question is how he manages to have these modal\nproperties. (1986, 198) \nA natural reaction to Lewis’s challenge is to point out that a\nproponent of transworld identity who is not a Lewisian realist will\ntypically reject Lewis’s counterpart theory on the grounds that his\ncounterpart relation does not have the logic of identity. If so, then\n(pace Lewis) it is not the case, strictly speaking, that the\n‘philosophers’ chorus on behalf of “trans-world\nidentity”’ is merely insisting on the neutral claim that\nobjects exist according to more than one world. However, even if this\nis correct, it does not answer a further potential challenge. Suppose,\nas seems plausible, that there could be a counterpart relation that\n(unlike the one proposed by Lewis himself) is an equivalence relation\n(transitive, symmetric, and reflexive), and ‘one-one between\nworlds’. What would distinguish, in the case of a theorist\nwho is not a Lewisian realist about possible worlds, between, on\nthe one hand, a commitment to the interpretation of de re\nmodal statements in terms of such an ‘identity-resembling’\ncounterpart relation, and, on the other hand, a commitment to genuine\ntransworld identity (and hence to the view that an individual\ngenuinely exists in a number of distinct possible worlds)?\nThe aficionado of transworld identity owes Lewis a reply to this\nchallenge.","contact.mail":"mark.jago@nottingham.ac.uk","contact.domain":"nottingham.ac.uk"}]
