A central\nthread running through his work is an unusually strong commitment to\nthe soundness of the ordinary human being’s judgments, and a\nconcern to fend off attempts, by philosophers and policy-makers, to\nreplace those judgments with the supposedly better\n“systems” invented by intellectuals. In his “History\nof Astronomy”, he characterizes philosophy as a discipline that\nattempts to connect and regularize the data of everyday experience\n(Smith 1795: 44–7); in TMS, he tries to develop moral theory out\nof ordinary moral judgments, rather than beginning from a\nphilosophical vantage point above those judgments; and a central\npolemic of WN is directed against the notion that government officials\nneed to guide the economic decisions of ordinary people. Perhaps\ntaking a cue from David Hume’s skepticism about the capacity of\nphilosophy to replace the judgments of common life, Smith is\nsuspicious of philosophy as conducted from a foundationalist\nstandpoint, outside the modes of thought and practice it examines.\nInstead, he maps common life from within, correcting it where\nnecessary with its own tools rather than trying either to justify or\nto criticize it from an external standpoint. He aims indeed to break\ndown the distinction between theoretical and ordinary thought. This\nintellectual project is not unconnected with his political interest in\nguaranteeing to ordinary individuals the “natural liberty”\nto act in accordance with their own judgments.\n\nSmith’s Theory of Moral Sentiments (TMS) tends to\narouse sharply divergent reactions among the philosophers who pick it\nup. Kant is said to have considered it his favorite among Scottish\nmoral sense theories (Fleischacker 1991), but others have dismissed it\nas devoid of systematic argument, or derivative, in its theoretical\naspirations, of Hume. What explains these disparate reactions is one\nand the same feature of the book: that it consists largely of what\nSmith himself calls “illustrations” of the workings of the\nmoral sentiments (TMS, “Advertisement”)—short\nvignettes, elegantly described, that attempt to show what frightens us\nabout death, what we find interesting and what dull or distasteful\nabout other people’s love affairs, how moral luck factors into\nour assessment of various actions (Garrett 2005; Hankins 2016), or how\nand why we deceive ourselves. To some, this provides the detail and\npsychological acuity that they find lacking in most moral philosophy;\nto others, it seems something more properly taken up by novelists or\nempirical psychologists, not the business of a philosopher. Indeed,\none prominent view of TMS is that it is a work in descriptive\npsychology or sociology, not a contribution to normative moral theory\n(Campbell 1971; Raphael 2007). This reading is hard to square with\nthe many normative judgments in TMS (see Hanley 2009, chapter 2 and\nOtteson 2002, chapter 6).  It also misses the force of Smith’s\ninsistence that the proper way to make normative judgments is to\nconsider the details of a phenomenon from an impartial perspective: to\njudge the workings of our moral faculties, then, we need to consider\nthem, and their uses, in appropriate detail. Laying out in\ndetail how they work can help us see how they can be corrupted, and\ntherefore to avoid that corruption, at least to some extent (see TMS\n61–6, 92–104). If this was Smith’s goal—and it\nfits the text of TMS very well—then he was engaged not in the\nsociology or psychology but the phenomenology of morals,\ndescribing the workings of our modes of moral judgment as carefully as\npossible from within, and believing that the comprehensive view that\nresults can itself help guide us in moral judgment. Moral\nphenomenology is normative moral theory, for him, and there\nis no more foundational theory—no set of general\nprinciples—of which we might avail ourselves. Justification for\nhow we make moral judgments can only be found within the way we\nactually do make moral judgments; both moral justification and moral\ncritique must be immanent to, not transcendent of, our moral practice\n(compare TMS 313–4). \nA few implications of this approach. First, Smith is an\nanti-reductionist. He does not think morality can be reduced to a set\nof natural or divine laws, nor that it is simply a means for producing\n“the greatest happiness for the greatest number of\npeople,” in the phrase coined by his teacher, Frances Hutcheson.\nHe indeed says explicitly, against the proto-utilitarianism of\nHutcheson and Hume, that philosophers in his day have paid too much\nattention to the consequences of actions, and he wants to focus\ninstead on their propriety: the relation they bear to the motive that\ninspires them (18–19). At the same time, he argues that the\nmoral systems proposed by Samuel Clarke, William Wollaston, and Lord\nShaftesbury overstress propriety, which is just one “essential\ningredient” in virtuous action (294; see also 265 and 326). His\nown view attempts to take account of all the essential ingredients in\nvirtue and moral judgment, and to resist the temptation to reduce\nthose ingredients to a single principle (see 326–7). \nSecond, and relatedly, Smith’s way of approaching virtue often\nresembles Aristotle’s—who has also sometimes been seen as\ntoo fond of the description of virtue, and who tried to acknowledge\nthe many diverse elements of virtue, and the judgment of virtue,\nrather than to reduce them to a single principle. Smith says at the\nend of TMS that his system corresponds “pretty exactly”\nwith Aristotle’s (271). The attentive reader of TMS will have\nnoticed this earlier: when he characterizes propriety as lying between\nthe excess and defect of passion (27), for instance, or when he\ndistinguishes the restraint of appetite out of self-interest from the\nvirtue of temperance (28), or when he emphasizes habit (152, 324), or\nthe superiority of friendships of virtue over friendships of pleasure\n(224–5). \nFinally, Smith’s phenomenological method is interwoven\nwith his strong leanings toward particularism. He insists that general\nmoral rules are “founded upon experience of what, in particular\ninstances, our moral faculties, our natural sense of merit and\npropriety, approve, or disapprove of” (159; see also 160 and\n320), and that our notions of right and wrong bottom out in these\nreactions to particular cases (320; see also 187 and Gill 2014). His\naccount of virtue as depending on our attempts to adjust ourselves as\nclosely as possible to the feelings of the particular others we\nencounter also suggests that what is virtuous in one set of\ncircumstances may not be so in different circumstances. These\ncommitments entail that moral theorists will give us little moral\nguidance if they present just the general structure of right and wrong\n(and Smith thinks that moral theory should help guide moral practice:\nTMS 293, 315). A fine-grained phenomenology of how we carry out\nvarious kinds of moral judgment, and the errors or infelicities to\nwhich we are prone in this process, will be far more helpful. \nWith these methodological points in mind, let’s proceed to the\ncontents of TMS. Smith begins the book with an account of sympathy,\nwhich he describes as arising when we imagine how we would feel in the\ncircumstances of others. (A rich discussion of Smith on sympathy can\nbe found in Griswold 1999, ch.2; see also Fleischacker 2019, chapter\n2.) This is somewhat different from Hume’s account, on which\nsympathy normally consists in feeling what others actually\nfeel in their circumstances. Hume’s may be called a\n“contagion” account of sympathy, while Smith’s is a\n“projective” account (see Fleischacker 2012 and\n2019). Smith’s projective account opens up the possibility that\nour feelings on another person’s behalf may often not match the\nfeelings she herself has. Indeed to some extent they will never match,\nsince imagining oneself into a set of circumstances will always lack\nthe intensity of actually experiencing those circumstances (TMS\n21–2). This difference is of great importance to Smith, since he\nmaintains that trying to share the feelings of others as closely as\npossible is one of our main drives in life. We make constant efforts\nto adjust our feelings, as spectators, to those of the people\n“principally concerned” in a set of circumstances\n(importantly, these include people acted upon as well as agents), and\nto adjust our feelings as people principally concerned to a level with\nwhich sympathetic spectators can go along (110–13,\n135–6). It is this process of mutual emotional adjustment that\ngives rise to virtue: the “awful” virtues of\nself-restraint, insofar as the people principally concerned keep\nthemselves from feeling, or at least expressing, the full flood of\ntheir grief or joy, and the “amiable” virtues of\ncompassion and humanity, insofar as the spectators strive to\nparticipate in the joys and sufferings of others (23–5). \nNeither the feelings we seek to have nor the standards\nby which we judge feelings need be identical with the feelings\nand standards that are actually current in our society. We know that\nmany actual spectators misjudge our situations out of ignorance or\ninterest, so we seek to judge, and act on, just the feelings that a\nwell-informed and impartial spectator would have (TMS 129,\n135). Smith thinks that to sympathize with another’s feelings is\nto approve of those feelings (17), and to sympathize as we think an\nimpartial spectator would is to approve morally of\nthose feelings. Moral norms thus express the feelings of an impartial\nspectator. A feeling, whether on the part of a person motivated to\ntake an action or on the part of a person who has been acted upon by\nothers, is worthy of moral approval if and only if an impartial\nspectator would sympathize with that feeling. (Again, people acted\nupon are subject to moral judgment as well as agents; reactions can be\njudged as well as actions.) When achieving a morally right feeling is\ndifficult, we call that achievement “virtuous”; otherwise,\nwe describe people as acting or failing to act within the bounds of\n“propriety” (25). Thus do moral norms and ideals, and the\njudgments by which we guide ourselves towards those norms and ideals,\narise out of the process by which we try to achieve mutual\nsympathy. \nSmith distinguishes two kinds of normative guides to action: rules and\nvirtues. Moral rules, formed on the basis of our reactions to specific\ninstances (we say to ourselves, “I’ll never do\nthat”), bar certain especially egregious kinds of\nbehavior—murder, rape, theft—and provide a framework of\nshared expectations for society (156–66). They are essential to\njustice, especially, without which societies could not survive. They\nalso enable people who are not fully virtuous to behave with a minimum\nof decorum and decency (162–3), and help all of us cut through\nthe “veil of self-delusion” (158) by which we misrepresent\nour situations to ourselves. Virtue requires more than simply\nfollowing moral rules, however. Our emotional dispositions need to be\nre-configured so that we do not merely “affect” the\nsentiments of the impartial spectator but “adopt” those\nsentiments: identify ourselves with, become, the impartial spectator,\ninsofar as that is possible (147). If we are truly virtuous, a\nsubmission to certain rules will constrain everything we do, but\nwithin that framework we will operate without rules, trying instead to\nmold ourselves with the know-how by which an artist molds his clay,\nsuch that we develop dispositions to proper gratitude, kindness,\ncourage, patience, and endurance. \nThis is a picture that owes a great deal to Hume and Joseph Butler,\nbut gets worked out by Smith in much greater detail. It has been\nhailed by some as an especially sensible recognition of the kind and\ndegree of virtue appropriate to modern liberal politics and commercial\nsociety (Berry 1992; McCloskey 2006). Others see a darker, more\npessimistic attitude towards virtue in Smith, echoing the kinds of\nworries to be found in Rousseau about the corruption wrought by\ncommerce (Dwyer 1987, chapter 7). Still others argue that\nSmith’s account of virtue re-works but to a remarkable degree\nalso retains the highest ideals of both the Christian and the ancient\nGreco-Roman traditions, suggesting that his willingness to uphold such\nan ideal of character even in modern commercial societies should be\nunderstand as a critique rather than an endorsement of Rousseau\n(Hanley 2009). \nIn any case, Smith gives us more a virtue ethics than a rule-based\nmoral system along the lines proposed by Kant and the utilitarians.\nNevertheless, he tries to incorporate some of the intuitions that\ngenerated these other systems. As we have seen, he thinks that we need\nto submit to general rules, and his reasons for supposing that relying\non sentiment alone can feed our self-deceit anticipate Kant’s\ncritique of moral sentimentalism in the Groundwork (see\nFleischacker 1991). Smith also acknowledges that we in fact judge\nactions by their effects as well as their intentions, and thinks this\nsort of judgment is appropriate as long as we look at effects\nas they are intended, and not just as they happen to occur.\nThe “merit” of actions, he says in Book II of TMS, depends\non their consequences, even if their propriety is independent of\nconsequences; the point, for him, is just that these are two\ndifferent elements of moral judgment and the first is of\ngreater importance than the second (188). Having insisted on this, he\ngrants that in some cases the consequences of an action—where\nthey threaten the very survival of our society, for instance—may\ntrump all other considerations (90–91). \nIn line with his concern for accurate moral phenomenology, Smith also\ntries to make sense of the role that religion and culture play in our\nmoral lives. He handles the first of these by explaining why people\nwho come to believe in higher powers will naturally attribute virtues,\nand a concern for our virtue, to those powers (163–6). He also\nsays that it adds to the sacredness we attribute to moral rules to see\nthem as laws of the Deity, and to the importance of morality as a\nwhole to see it as a way of “co-operat[ing] with the\nDeity” in the governance of the universe (166). And he shows how\na belief in an afterlife may be necessary if we are to see the\nuniverse as just, which in turn is important if we are to maintain our\ncommitment to the value of acting morally (168–70). In all these\nways, but especially the last, he anticipates Kant’s moral\nargument for belief in God, without ever quite saying that there\nis a God. At the same time, he makes clear that any religion\nthat gives priority to ritual or creed over morality is baleful, and\nposes grave dangers to a decent and peaceful society\n(TMS 176–7; cf. WN 802–3). \nSmith handles the importance of culture under the heading of\n“custom and fashion.” Book V of TMS takes up this topic,\nacknowledging the influence of prevailing opinions in each society\nover all sorts of value judgments, and granting that what is regarded\nas virtuous will vary to some extent in accordance with this\ninfluence. The French value politeness more than the Russians, and the\nDutch value frugality more than the Poles (TMS 204). The leisured\nclasses in every country tend to be less strict about sexual mores\nthan the working classes (WN 794). These are easily explicable\ndifferences, and not worrisome ones: they are matters of emphasis, and\ncannot affect “the general style of conduct or behaviour”\nof a society. That general style of conduct cannot vary in its\nessentials. No society could survive otherwise (TMS 209, 211). \nPart VI of TMS, added in the last edition, presents the virtues of\nprudence, benevolence and self-command by way of a series of elegant\ncharacter portraits, and part VII offers a short history of moral\nphilosophy, which stresses the contributions of Plato, Aristotle, and\nthe Stoics. This way of concluding the book reinforces the emphasis on\nvirtuous character, as opposed to a decision-procedure for specific\nactions, and indicates that we might gain by returning to the ancient\nschools of moral philosophy that shared this emphasis. Smith does not\nendorse any ancient moral theorist uncritically, but—like\nShaftesbury and Hume—he seems to look forward to a revival of\nancient Greek ethics, a modern retrieval and re-working of the\ncharacter ideals on which those schools had focused. \nSmith’s version of moral sentimentalism has a number of\nadvantages over those of his contemporaries. His approach yields moral\njudgments closer to those we already normally make, and makes better\nsense of the complexity and richness of both virtue and the judgment\nof virtue. He is expressly concerned to do justice to this complexity,\ncriticizing Hutcheson for reducing virtue too single-mindedly to\nbenevolence, and Hume for putting too much emphasis on utility. \nIn addition, none of Smith’s predecessors had developed such an\nessentially social conception of the self. Hutcheson and Hume both see\nhuman beings as having a natural disposition to care about\nthe good of their society, but for Smith, all our feelings, whether\nself-interested or benevolent, are constituted by a\nprocess of socialization. Smith conceives of humanity as less capable\nof solipsism than Hume does, less capable of the thoroughgoing egoism\nthat Hume, in his famous discussion of the sensible knave, finds it so\ndifficult to refute (Hume 1777, 81–2). At the same time, Smith\nreconciles his social conception of the self with a deep respect for\nthe importance of each individual self, and the capacity of each self\nfor independent choice. Ethical self-transformation, for Smith, is\ninspired and guided by social pressures but ultimately carried out by\nthe individual for him or herself. The “impartial\nspectator” begins as a product and expression of society, but\nbecomes, once internalized, a source of moral evaluation that enables\nthe individual to stand apart from, and criticize, his or her society.\nIndividually free action and the social construction of the self are\ncompatible, for Smith, even dependent on one another. \nWe can more fully appreciate what is distinctive in Smith by comparing\nhim with Hume. Smith’s thought circles around Hume’s:\nthere is virtually nothing in either TMS or WN without some sort of\nsource or anticipation in Hume, although there is also almost no\nrespect in which Smith agrees entirely with Hume. Take their accounts\nof sympathy, for example. When Hume describes the workings of\nsympathy, he says that emotions “readily pass from one person to\nanother,” like the motion of a string equally wound up with\nother strings, “communicat[ing] itself to the rest” (Hume\n1739–40, p. 576; see also pp. 317, 605). He then explains that\nwe obtain our idea of the other person’s feelings by\ninference—from the effects (smiles, frowns) or causes of those\nfeelings. In both cases, the other’s feeling, once inferred,\ncommunicates itself directly to us, and our imaginations only\nintensify our idea of that feeling so as to raise it to the level of\nan impression (Hume 1739–40, pp. 576, 319–20). For Smith,\nby contrast, we place ourselves in the other’s situation and\nimagine what we would feel if we were there. Imagination is essential\nto the production even of the “idea” of another’s\nfeelings, and sympathetic feelings are no longer ones that the other\nperson need actually have. (Smith points out that this explains how we\nsympathize with some people, like gravely ill infants or the insane,\nwho do not actually experience the suffering we feel on their behalf\n[TMS 12–13]). This account allows for us to judge other\npeople’s feelings against the background of our sympathetic\nfeelings for them. Sympathy is thus not just a way of sharing\nfeelings with others; it also opens a gap between their\nfeelings and ours. And that gap gives us a grip on the\nnotion—crucial to Smith’s theory—that certain\nfeelings are appropriate to a situation, while others are not. \nThese seemingly slight shifts from Hume—understanding sympathy\nas 1) produced by the imagination and 2) a response to situations\nrather than something passed on, causally, from one person to\nanother—have immense implications for the shape of Smith’s\nthought. The first of them leads him to give a central place to works\nof the imagination in moral development. He frequently brings in\nexamples from poetry and drama to explain or give evidence for his\npoints (e.g., TMS 30, 32–3, 34, 177, 227), twice recommends\nwriters like Voltaire as great “instructors” in certain\nvirtues (TMS 143, 177), and seems to see moral philosophy itself as a\nwork of the imagination, a project that needs to draw on imaginative\nresources and that properly aims at extending and enriching the moral\nimaginations of its readers (compare Griswold 1999, chapter 1). It is\ntherefore for him a project to which clarity, vivacity and elegance\nare as important as good argument, and Smith was in fact very\nconcerned with finding the appropriate rhetoric—the appropriate\nappeal to the imagination—for his works (see Griswold 1999;\nMuller 1993; Brown 1994). Both of his books are beautifully written,\nand filled with vivid, memorable examples. \nThe second of the shifts enables Smith to be more of a moral realist\nthan Hume. Smith finds an ingenious way of importing Samuel\nClarke’s concern with “fitnesses” (Clarke 1703) into\nmoral sentimentalism. On his view, we aim to have, and act on, just\nthose feelings that an impartial spectator would have in our\nsituations; the feelings we attribute to such a spectator are then the\nones fitted to that situation. So our feelings have something to aim\nat, by which they can be judged or measured. This allows Smith to\ntalk, as he does throughout TMS, of “fitness” (e.g., 149,\n159, 165, 305, 311), of feelings being “suitable to their\nobjects” (16–20, 40, 70, 73, 102), and, by extension, of\npeople being suited to the approval or disapproval bestowed upon them\n(58, 114, 118, 126). He thereby restores a meaning to our ordinary\nview of value judgments as correct or incorrect, and not merely as\nfostering or discouraging actions and qualities that may be useful to\nsociety. Relatedly, he sees our sentiments as more flexible than Hume\ndoes, and more responsive to criticism. As socialized human beings, we\ndo not simply desire certain objects but desire to have just\nthose desires of which an impartial spectator would approve. What are\ntoday called “second-order desires” accompany and shape\nall our first-order desires (110–11; compare Frankfurt 1971). This\ngives our emotions the internal structure they need to be able to\nchange in response to norms. \nAccordingly, it makes much more sense for Smith than for Hume that we\nought to assess our sentiments critically. Hume grants that we correct\nour sympathy for partiality by adopting in imagination a “steady\nand general point of view” (Hume 1739–40, p. 581), but for\nSmith this concession comes too late. Smith sees sympathy as building\nan aspiration to make one’s sentiments harmonize with the\nsentiments of others into those sentiments themselves. If\nthey did not already have such an aspiration, we would have neither\nmotivation nor reason to take up the “steady and general point\nof view.” It makes little sense to treat our sentiments as\nbaldly given natural reactions, impervious to reason, but then add\nthat they may need “correction.” If sentiments are bald\nnatural reactions, they can be neither correct nor incorrect; if they\nare impervious to reason, then we can have reason, at most, to\nappear to have sentiments other than the ones we happen to\nhave, not truly to change those sentiments. For Smith, the\naspiration to be worthy of approval belongs to our sentiments from the\nbeginning, and we have, accordingly, both motivation and reason to\nchange our sentiments if they keep us from this aspiration.  \nRelatedly, for Smith but not for Hume there is a lot to learn about\nwhat sentiments we should have. In neither the Treatise nor\nthe second Enquiry does Hume spend any significant time on\nhow we might learn to acquire new sentiments or alter the ones we\nhave. By contrast, the first five parts of TMS—almost two-thirds\nof the text—are devoted to a delineation of the various ways in\nwhich we learn to assess our sentiments, and in which learning to\nassess them enables us both to express them with propriety, and to\nchange them. \nThere is also for Smith, far more than for Hume, a place for moral\nhistory. Smith’s deep interweaving of individuals with their\nsociety, and of socialization with moral development, alerts him to\nthe many ways in which moral norms and ideals are indexed to\nhistorical circumstances (see Schliesser 2006). This comes out in the\ndetailed accounts he gives, in his lectures on jurisprudence, of how\nnotions of property, contract, marriage, and punishment have arisen\nand changed in various societies. The idea of a history of morals\nopens up here, and Smith—via his student John Millar, who\nattended the lectures on jurisprudence—was an important source\nof later sociological and anthropological accounts of normative\nchange. \nFinally, Smith is further from utilitarianism than Hume. Both the\nnotion of sentiments as having or lacking an intrinsic propriety\nindependently of their effects, and the arguments, in Books II and IV,\nagainst reducing our interest in justice and beauty to our interest in\ntheir useful effects, are meant to counteract the utilitarian\ntendencies in Hume. Smith’s particularist conception of moral\njudgment, and his playing down of the effects of actions in favor of\ntheir motivations, keep him far from consequentialism. He believes\nthat our faculties of moral evaluation are always directed toward the\nmotivations and well-being of particular individuals in particular\nsituations, not to goods that might be possessed jointly by groups of\nhuman beings, and he rejects the idea that our assessments or\ndecisions should aim at the greatest happiness for the greatest number\nof people (TMS 237). In addition, he sees happiness as so shaped by\nthe possession of morally appropriate dispositions that it cannot\nserve as a nonmoral goal that might help us define those dispositions.\nIt is essential to the hedonic calculus that happiness be defined\nindependently of morality, so that it can bestow content on moral\nclaims (see McDowell 1998a). That is impossible, for Smith. Smith sees\nmeeting the demands of the impartial spectator as intrinsic to\nhappiness; there is no happiness independent of morality. \nSmith’s moral theory has been accused of three major failings.\nFirst, it offers us no clear procedure for deciding which actions we\nshould take in specific circumstances, no guidelines for how we can\ntell, in specific cases, what the impartial spectator has to say.\nSecond, the impartial spectator seems too enmeshed in the attitudes\nand interests of the society in which it develops for it to be free of\nthat society’s biases, or to help us care impartially for all\nhuman beings. And third, even if Smith’s analysis of moral\nclaims is correct, even if it is true that moral judgments in ordinary\nlife consist in attempts to express how an impartial spectator would\nfeel about our conduct, it remains unclear what justifies these\njudgments. Why should we heed the demands of the impartial\nspectator? \nSmith would probably dismiss the first of these objections, as based\non an erroneous notion of what moral philosophy ought to do. Moral\nphilosophy can deepen our love for virtue, refine our understanding of\nthe virtues, and enrich our understanding of ourselves, all of which\ncan conduce to a firmer moral disposition and to a wiser, more careful\napproach to moral decisions, but it cannot and should not replace the\ncommon-life processes by which we actually make those decisions.\nPhilosophy is an abstract, intellectual, and solitary activity, while\nmoral decision-making is and should be concrete, driven by emotion as\nmuch as by the intellect, and shaped by our interactions with the\npeople affected by our actions. \nThe second and third objections constitute what we might call a\ntribalist or relativist and a skeptical challenge. The tribalist sees\nno reason to extend moral sentiments or modes of judgment to people\noutside his society, and no reason to criticize the basic structures\nof moral sentiment in his society. He thereby seems to miss a basic\nfeature of moral demands. But where is the room for a universalist\nmorality in Smith’s account? Since we construct the impartial\nspectator within us out of attitudes in the society around us, how can\nthat spectator reach beyond our society sufficiently to achieve a\nsensitive and impartial concern for members of other societies, and to\nrecognize where our society’s sentiments are biased or\ncorrupt? \nThe skeptic represents a yet deeper problem. Smith says that when we\nissue a moral judgment, of others or of ourselves, we express the\nrelationship of one set of sentiments—the cooler, more\nreflective sentiments characteristic of a spectator—to another.\nThis seems a plausible account of what we actually do, when judging\nmorally; it captures nicely the “feel” of ordinary moral\njudgments. But does it give us reason to heed such judgments? Does it\nexplain the normativity of moral judgments, our sense that we ought to\nlisten to them? \nSmith clearly rejects any tribal limit to the reach of moral demands.\nHe adopts the Stoic view that each person is “first and\nprincipally recommended [by nature] to his own care” (TMS 219),\nand that we similarly care more about members of our own society than\nabout people far away from us (139–40, 227–8). At the same\ntime, however—also like the Stoics—he thinks that our\nmoral feelings extend, if to a lesser degree, to all rational and\nsensible beings: “our good-will is circumscribed by no boundary,\nbut may embrace the immensity of the universe” (235). Indeed, he\nregards accepting harm to one’s local community, if that is\nnecessary for the good of the universe, as a mark of the highest\nwisdom and virtue (235–6). As Amartya Sen has stressed, Smith\nalso wants us to evaluate our conduct from the perspective of any\nhuman being anywhere, not just a member of our own society. Sen quotes\na passage in TMS in which Smith says that we “endeavour to\nexamine our own conduct as we imagine any other fair and\nimpartial spectator would imagine it” (110), arguing that it\nimplies we should seek to be informed by the views of people far\noutside our cultural communities. “The need to invoke how things\nwould look to ‘any other fair and impartial\nspectator,’” says Sen, “is a requirement that can\nbring in judgments that would be made by disinterested people from\nother societies as well” (Sen 2009: 125). And Smith certainly\ndid aspire to provide such a standard of moral judgment, a structure\nfor morality that reaches out across national and cultural\nborders. \nBut is Smith’s impartial spectator capable of doing this?\nConsider two of its features. First, it uses sentiments rather than\nreason as the basis of its judgments. It is not like Roderick\nFirth’s ideal observer, dispassionately watching people from\nabove the emotional fray (Firth 1952). Rather, Smith follows Hutcheson\nand Hume in tracing moral judgment, ultimately, to feelings. The\nimpartial spectator is supposed to be free of partial\nfeelings—feelings that depend on a stake it might have\nin a dispute, or on blind favoritism or dislike for one party or the\nother—but it is not supposed to be free of feelings altogether,\nnor to reach for a principle it might derive from reason alone,\nindependent of feeling (see Raphael 2007, chapter 6). But our feelings\nare notoriously shaped by our societies, and it is not clear how a\ndevice that depends on feelings could correct for biases built into\nthem.  \nSecond, the impartial spectator develops within us as part of our\nefforts to align our feelings with those of the people immediately\naround us. The “chief part of human happiness,” for Smith,\ncomes from the consciousness that we are “beloved” (TMS\n41), but that is not possible unless our feelings, and the actions we\ntake on those feelings, meet with other people’s approval. The\nsearch for feelings we can share—for mutual sympathy—is a\nbasic human drive, and it leads among other things to the rise of\nmorality. Of course, that eventually means that we correct the modes\nof approval of people around us for bias and misinformation; we seek\nthe judgment of an impartial spectator within rather than partial\nspectators without. But Smith never suggests that this impartial\nspectator uses different methods of judging, appeals to\ndifferent sorts of norms, than our neighbors do. It arises out of the\nactual process of moral judgment around us, and we heed it as part of\nour drive to find a harmony of feelings with our actual neighbors. It\nis very unlikely, then, to use a method of judging radically unlike\nthose of our actual neighbors, or perceive, let alone correct for, a\nsystematic bias in the sentiments of our society. If sentiments of\ncondescension or dislike toward poor people, or black people, or gay\npeople, pervade our society, then there is every reason to expect that\nmany of us, especially in privileged groups, will build an impartial\nspectator within ourselves that shares those biases rather than rising\nabove them.  \nThese are the sorts of considerations that led Smith himself to worry\nabout the danger that “established custom” can distort\nmoral judgment (TMS 210), and that nature may lead people, foolishly\nand unjustly, to admire the rich and despise the poor (50–62).\nSmith also worried that political faction and religious fanaticism can\n“pervert” our moral feelings (155–6, 176–7),\nand did not suggest ways to correct for that danger. It is unclear how\nhis moral theory might supply such a corrective. \nMoreover, much that is attractive about Smith’s theory is bound\nup with this limitation; his relativistic tendencies are not a mere\nmistake but a consequence of the structure of his theory. The absence\nof transcendental principles in favor of judgments rooted in our\neveryday sentiments, the view of individuals as aiming, by way of\nmorality, for emotional harmony with their neighbors, the\npsychological insight of his view of moral development—all these\nthings go together with a picture on which we are deeply shaped by our\nlocal societies in the way we make moral judgments, and can turn those\njudgments on our society only with difficulty. It has been suggested\nthat Smith thought better information about the lives of poor people\ncould help well-off people judge the poor more favorably (Fleischacker\n2004, chapter 10), and perhaps he thought that slavery and other\ninjustices could likewise be overturned by better information:\ninformation enabling people to project themselves into the lives of\nslaves, and other victims of injustice, and thereby to sympathize with\nthem. Sometimes Smith also drops proto-Kantian hints that a concern\nfor the equal worth of every human being lies at the basis of all\nmoral sentiments (TMS 90, 107, 137), and Stephen Darwall and Remy\nDebes have brought out a latent egalitarianism in the structure of\nSmith’s moral theory that could be turned against inegalitarian\nsocial institutions (Darwall 1999; Debes 2012). But even a commitment\nto the equal worth of every human being can be interpreted in ways\nthat support local biases—Kant, notoriously, maintained racist\nand sexist views long after coming up with his arguments for equal\nworth—and Smith in any case says little to justify his\negalitarian tendencies. So it must be admitted that the tribalist\nchallenge brings out a weakness in Smith’s theory, and cannot\neasily be answered without sacrificing some of its central elements.\n(For more on these issues, see Forman-Barzilai 2010). \nSmith does better with the skeptical challenge. To the person who\nasks, “why be moral?,” Smith essentially provides what\nChristine Korsgaard calls a “reflective endorsement”\nargument (Korsgaard 1996: 19, 49–89). Reflective endorsement\ntheorists—Korsgaard gives Hume and Butler as\nexamples—substitute the question, “are the claims of our\nmoral nature good for human life?” for the question, “are\nmoral claims true?” They identify a certain faculty for approval\nor disapproval as giving force to moral claims, and then ask whether,\non reflection, we can approve of that faculty of approval itself. This\ntest requires in the first instance that the faculty of moral approval\napprove of its own workings. It then looks to whether our other\nfaculties of approval can approve of the moral one: we seek a\ncomprehensive endorsement, by all our modes of approval, of moral\napproval in particular. The second part of the test asks above all\nwhether the faculty for prudential approval—the faculty by which\nwe applaud or condemn things in accordance with\nself-interest—can applaud the moral faculty, since the latter\noften requires us to override our self-interest. \nWe should not assume that the first part of the test is trivial.\nKorsgaard quotes Hume’s declaration that our sense for\nmorals \nmust certainly acquire new force, when reflecting on itself, it\napproves of those principles, from whence it is deriv’d, and\nfinds nothing but what is great and good in its rise and origin, (Hume\n1739–40, pp. 267–8)  \nand contrasts this with Hume’s earlier demonstration that the\nunderstanding, when reflecting on its own procedures, undermines\nitself (Korsgaard 1996, p. 62). So a faculty can fail a purely\nreflexive test: it can fail to live up to its own standards for\nevaluation. But the moral sense, for Hume, and the impartial\nspectator, for Smith, pass their own tests. Indeed, a good way to read\nTMS is to see Smith as demonstrating, to an impartial spectator in a\nmoment of reflection, that the impartial spectator we use in the\ncourse of action operates in a reasonable and noble way—that, in\nparticular, it is not just a tool of our self-interest. \nAt the same time, to meet the full reflective endorsement test, Smith\nneeds to show that heeding the impartial spectator does not, overall,\nconflict with our self-interest. In order to show this he\ntries, like many ancient ethicists, to get us to re-think the nature\nof self-interest. If we consider our real interests, Smith maintains,\nwe will see that the very question, “why should I be\nmoral?,” with its implicit supposition that being moral is\nsomething I might want to avoid, is based on a misconception of\nself-interest. “The chief part of human happiness arises from\nthe consciousness of being beloved” (TMS 41), Smith says, and\nbeing beloved normally requires acting in accordance with the demands\nof the impartial spectator. Violating those demands will also normally\nbring on internal unease—fear of discovery, pangs of conscience,\nand other disturbances—making it difficult to achieve the\ntranquility that Smith takes to be a prime component of happiness (TMS\n149). Finally, if one fully incorporates the impartial spectator into\noneself, one will discover that moral self-approbation is itself a\ngreat source of happiness. But if happiness consists so centrally in\nthe approbation of others, and in self-approbation, there can be no\nreasonable conflict between pursuing happiness and pursuing morality.\nSo the demands of our moral sentiments are justified, capable both of\nendorsing themselves and of being endorsed by our nonmoral\nsentiments. \nIt should be clear that this argument does not involve any reduction\nof morality to self-interest. For Smith, the agent who supposes that\nself-interest can be defined independently of morality, and morality\nthen reduced to it, misunderstands the nature of self-interest. Such\nan agent lacks a well-developed impartial spectator within herself,\nand therefore fails to realize that acting in accordance with moral\ndemands is essential to her own happiness. She will gain a better\nunderstanding of happiness only once she starts to engage in the\npursuit of virtue. Smith explicitly says that the virtuous agent sees\nthings that others do not (TMS 115–7, 146–8). Like the\ncontemporary philosopher John McDowell, he thus suggests that the\nvirtuous agent can properly see the point of virtue, and how virtue\nhelps constitute happiness, only from a perspective within the actual\npractice of virtue. But, as McDowell says, there is no reason to think\none can find better arguments, or indeed any arguments, for seeking\nvirtue from a perspective outside of such practice (McDowell 1998a,b).\nThere may therefore be a certain circularity to Smith’s defense\nof morality, as some of his critics have alleged, but the circularity\nis not a vicious one, and an entirely nonmoral defense of morality,\nwhich the critics seem to want, may be impossible. \nSmith himself does not clearly spell out the responses proposed here\nto the philosophical problems that his theory raises. His strengths as\na moral philosopher lie elsewhere. Moral philosophers need not be\nconcerned solely with the grounds of morality. Displaying, clarifying,\nand showing the internal connections in the way we think about virtue\nis already a philosophical task, even if we set aside the question of\nwhether that way of thinking is justified. There are indeed\nphilosophers who reject the idea that philosophy is well-suited to\noffer justifications. Smith’s work fits in with the view of Iris\nMurdoch, who understood moral philosophy as consisting in the attempt\n“to fill in a systematic explanatory background to our ordinary\nmoral life” (Murdoch 1970, p. 45). His astute and nuanced\nanalysis of what goes into moral approval—of the sorts of\nfactors the impartial spectator considers, of how it can deceive\nitself or otherwise go wrong, of how it develops and how it judges\ndifferent virtues in different ways—is accomplishment enough,\nregardless of whether he adequately justifies the fact that we engage\nin such approval at all.  \nIt is clear from the end of TMS that Smith intended to complement it\nwith a system of political philosophy, and it is clear from the\nAdvertisement to the last edition of TMS that WN represents the\npartial but not complete fulfillment of that plan. Strikingly, what\ngot left out was the part of political philosophy that most concerned\nSmith at the end of TMS, and that has most concerned other moral\nphilosophers who turn to politics: a systematic account of justice.\nSmith’s lectures on jurisprudence dealt with this topic, and\nfrom the notes we have on those lectures, he seems to have hoped to\nbuild a comprehensive, universally-applicable theory of justice out of\nimpartial-spectator judgments about property, contract, punishment,\netc. But the manuscript drawn from these lectures was never finished,\nand he had it burned at his death. Some scholars speculate that the\nfailure of this project was fore-ordained: the moral theory of TMS is\ntoo particularist to sustain a universally-applicable theory of\njustice (see Griswold 1999, pp. 256–8 and Fleischacker 2004,\nchapter 8). Others have tried to re-construct such a theory for Smith\n(see Haakonssen 1981 and 1996). \nIn any case, Smith concluded his lectures on jurisprudence with some\nextended remarks on “police”—public policy\n—and this he did, of course, work up into a book of its own. It\nis unclear, however, how much WN has to do with his philosophical\nconcerns. Smith became increasingly interested in political economy\nafter completing TMS, and WN can be seen as the fruition simply of a\nnew direction in his research, unconnected to his moral system. He did\ncome to a comprehensive, one might say philosophical, view of\npolitical economy: from his understanding of the workings of\neconomics, he thought that states could foster the productiveness of\ntheir economies only by the rule of law, accompanied by a few\nlimitations on banking practices, and should otherwise lift measures\nthat restrict or encourage particular enterprises. The practical point\nof his treatise on economics was to urge this restrained, modest\napproach to economic intervention on governing officials. Smith did\nnot favor as hands-off an approach as some of his\nself-proclaimed followers do today—he believed that states could\nand should re-distribute wealth to some degree, and defend the poor\nand disadvantaged against those who wield power over them in the\nprivate sector (see Fleischacker 2004, § 57)—but he\ncertainly wanted the state to end all policies, common in his\nmercantilist day, designed to favor industry over agriculture, or some\nindustries over others. Smith believed strongly in the importance of\nlocal knowledge to economic decision-making, and consequently thought\nthat business should be left to businesspeople, who understand the\nparticular situations in which they work far better than any\ngovernment official (on this Hayek understood Smith well: see Hayek\n1978 [1976] and C. Smith 2013). By the same token, governance should be kept\nout of the hands of businesspeople, since they are likely to\nuse it to promote their particular interests, and not be concerned for\nthe well-being of the citizenry as a whole: Smith’s opposition\nto the East India Company is based on this principle (see Muthu\n2008). \nSmith’s political views tend more generally towards a minimalist\nstate. He did not want the state to micro-manage the economy, and he\nalso did not want it to promote religion or virtue. He was suspicious\nof the motives and skills of politicians, and their ability, even when\nwell-meaning, to change society (see Fleischacker 2004, chapter 11).\nAnd he did not believe that the political life was the crown of the\nmoral life, or that law or political institutions can help people\ndevelop virtue. \nOne might therefore wonder whether there is any connection between his\npolitics and his moral philosophy. Aside from the construction of\ntheories of justice—which, as we have noted, Smith wound up\nnot doing—there are three main reasons why moral\nphilosophers write political theories. Some, like Aristotle, see\nmorality as the cultivation of virtuous character and believe that the\nstate can help people with this cultivation. Others, like Jeremy\nBentham, see morality as maximizing human pleasure and believe that\nlegal and political reform can contribute significantly toward that\nend. And still others, like Hegel, see morality as the expression of\nfreedom and believe that states can embody the highest expression of\nfreedom. But Smith believes none of these things. His conception of\nmorality is quite Aristotelian, but for him the state can do little to\nhelp people achieve virtuous character. He shares neither\nBentham’s reduction of the good life to the pleasurable life nor\nBentham’s optimism about the likely effectiveness, for moral or\nhedonic purposes, of even much-reformed governments. And he never\ndescribes the state as an expression of freedom. \nThat leaves us with the possibility that Smith tries in WN precisely\nto try to cure his readers of the illusion that states have a moral\nfunction. There is a strong Stoic component to TMS, and we might say,\nin Stoic vein, that in WN Smith wants to help us see how much the\nsociety around us is out of our control. WN shows us the great degree\nto which social institutions and policies have unintended\nconsequences, the central role, in particular, of unforeseeable\nfactors in the workings of the market, and the fact that uncontrolled\nmarkets on the whole do well by all their participants. This allows us\nto become reconciled to allowing markets, and other social\ninstitutions, to run unfettered. \nSmith is more of an Enlightenment progressive than this reading\nsuggests, more of a believer that an enlightened understanding of\ntheir circumstances can help people improve those circumstances, but\nhe had less faith in this notion than did most of his contemporaries.\nThere are deep roots in his thought for a sceptical attitude towards\nprogressivism. His belief in local knowledge leads him to be\nsuspicious of large-scale plans for the reform of society. He also\nprovides a number of reasons for doubting whether we can successfully\nset for ourselves clear goals for such reform. For most enlightenment\nthinkers, including Smith’s predecessors Hutcheson and Hume,\nwhat human beings desire seemed fairly obvious. For Smith, this is not\nso obvious. Smith believes that it is very difficult for us to know\nour true intentions (TMS 156–9), and that our desires are\nheavily shaped by social interaction. He also casts doubt on the\ndegree to which we seek things that are truly useful to our ends. In a\nfamous passage, he says that we are more interested in a thing’s\napparent conduciveness to utility than in its actual\nutility (179–80). This observation serves as the jumping-off\npoint for his first foray into economics. The “poor man’s\nson, whom heaven in its anger has visited with ambition” pursues\nwealth without knowing what it is really like, because it\nseems—falsely—to be useful (181–3). In\nseveral ways, then, Smith pictures human desires and aims as more\nopaque than do most other Enlightenment thinkers. This picture informs\nhis distinctive account of society and history, moreover, according to\nwhich unintended consequences tend to be more important than intended\nones and the course of history is correspondingly unknowable in\nadvance. On such a view, it is futile for politicians to try to\ndetermine the future development of their societies. They do better\nrestricting their activities to protecting individual liberty against\nviolence—to defense and the administration of justice. \nWe might call this the libertarian reading of Smith, and it certainly\ncaptures an important element of his political philosophy. Smith gives\njustice priority over the other virtues in TMS (86), he begins his\nlectures on jurisprudence by saying that the maintenance of justice is\n“the first and chief design of every system of government”\n(Smith 1978, p. 5), and he brings in justice as a constraint on\neconomic activity many times in WN (e.g., WN 157, 539, 687). But he\ndoes not say that the enforcement of justice is the sole job of\ngovernment. The third of the tasks he gives to government in WN\nconsists in “maintaining and erecting” a broad range of\n“publick works and … publick institutions” for the\ngood of the whole society (WN 687–8). In TMS, the chapter often\nquoted as claiming that justice is the only virtue that may be\nenforced actually maintains only that “kindness or beneficence,\n… cannot, among equals, be extorted by force”\n(TMS 81). In a state “antecedent to the institution of civil\ngovernment,” Smith says, no impartial spectator would approve of\none person’s using force to make another act beneficently. But\nonce civil government has been established, people may legitimately be\nforced to carry out at least the greatest and most obvious duties of\nbeneficence. Smith says that \n[t]he civil magistrate is entrusted with the power not only of\n… restraining injustice, but of promoting the prosperity of the\ncommonwealth, by establishing good discipline, and by\ndiscouraging every sort of vice and impropriety; he may prescribe\nrules, therefore, which not only prohibit mutual injuries among\nfellow-citizens, but command mutual good offices to a certain degree.\n(81, emphasis added) \nSmith warns against taking this license for a general promotion of\nvirtue too far—that, he says, would be “destructive of all\nliberty, security, and justice”—but he also says that\nneglecting it will lead “to many gross disorders and shocking\nenormities” (TMS 81). These enormities may well include the\nmisery of the poor, a central concern of Smith’s in WN. Smith\nhad no principled objections to government power being used to help\nthe poor, and indeed proposed a number of policies with that in mind.\nIt should be remembered that the idea that governments might massively\nre-distribute wealth out of fairness to the poor was not on the agenda\nin Smith’s time. Only in the 1790s, after Smith died, did Jeremy\nBentham and Tom Paine offer their groundbreaking poverty programs; the\nsocialism of Robert Owen and Charles Fourier lay another generation in\nthe future. Until the late eighteenth century, most writers on the\nrole of government vis-à-vis the poor maintained that\ngovernments should keep the poor in poverty, so that they show proper\nrespect to their superiors and not waste money on drink. Smith had\nmore influence than anyone else in changing this attitude—he was\none of the earliest and most fervent champions of the rights and\nvirtues of the poor, arguing against wage caps and other constraints\nthat kept the poor from rising socially and economically (see Baugh\n1983 and Fleischacker 2004, chapter 10). \nSmith also had a more restricted conception of individual rights than\ndo contemporary libertarians. Taxation does not count as any sort of\nthreat to property rights, for him—he indeed describes paying\ntaxes as “a badge … of liberty” (WN 857)—nor\ndoes the government’s mere support for certain ideas and values\ncount as an infringement of the right to conscience. Although it may\nbe inefficient and otherwise unwise, it is not unjust for the\ngovernment to intervene in the economy on behalf of one or another\ncommercial interest, to spread propaganda for one or another\nconception of virtue, or even to establish a religion. Smith of course\nopposes economic intervention of this kind and thinks it better if\ngovernments do not establish religions, but his views on these issues\nstem from concerns other than justice. Moreover, he favors militia\ntraining to instill courage in people, state incentives urging people\nto study science and philosophy, and state encouragement for secular\namusements—the latter two as an “antidote to the poison of\n[religious] enthusiasm and superstition.” (WN 796) So\nSmith’s state is not a neutral one, in the modern sense, and it\nis not wholly uninterested in the promotion of virtue. \nWhy, then, does Smith recommend such a minimal state? The\ninterventions just listed are practically the only ones he urges in\nWN, and even in those cases, Smith calls for limited state action. Why\nallow governments to go so far, and no farther? \nThe first answer to that is that Smith did not think government\nofficials were competent to handle much beside the needs of defense\nand the administration of justice. Smith’s writings are\npermeated by a lack of respect for the sorts of people who go into\npolitics: for the vanity that leads them to seek fame and power, for\nthe presumption by which they regard themselves as morally superior to\nothers, and for the arrogance by which they think they know the\npeople’s interests and needs better than the people do\nthemselves. He also believes that politicians tend to be manipulated\nby the preaching of merchants who do not have the good of the nation\nas a whole at heart (WN 266–7), and that they can rarely know\nenough to guide large numbers of people. Correlatively, Smith has a\ngreat respect for the competence and virtue of common people. He shows\nno trace of the thought, common at the time and strongly held by\nHutcheson, that a class of wise and virtuous people ought to rule over\nthe common herd. \nIn addition, Smith holds that social sanctions can do a better job at\nmany tasks that other thinkers expected of political sanctions. His\nrich account in TMS of the way that spectators around us shape us\nmorally enables him to hold that governments need not teach\nvirtue. Society, independent of governmental power, will do that on\nits own. Thus sumptuary laws are unnecessary because the desire to\nmaintain or increase one’s social status will keep most people\nprudent and frugal (WN 341–6). Thus religious groups that\nspontaneously arise without government assistance do a better job of\ninculcating virtues than their government-supported counterparts (WN\n792–6). And thus—implicitly—the civic republican\nobsession with a citizen militia is overwrought because the habits of\nself-command inculcated by military service can also be achieved, for\nmost people, by the social interactions of the market (see\nFleischacker 1999, pp. 153–6, 169–72). \nFinally, Smith limits the activities of governments because he\nconsiders it crucial to the development of virtue that people have\nplenty of room to act, and shape their feelings, on their own.\nBecoming a good human being is ultimately a task that each individual\nmust take up for him or herself. People develop better moral judgment\nby actually making moral judgments (WN 782–3, 788), and virtue\nrequires the practice of virtue (TMS 324); we cannot achieve these\nthings simply by following the say-so of an authority. So exercises of\npower tend to be inimical to moral development, and governments should\nuse their power mostly to minimize the degree to which power gets\nexercised elsewhere.  \nIndeed, for Smith, governments can best encourage virtue precisely by\nrefraining from encouraging virtue. In TMS, the person who\nmerely tries to appear virtuous, whether out of fear of the law or out\nof fear of social disapproval, is not really virtuous. But there is a\nsliding scale here. One who acts virtuously out of concern for the\npraise and blame of her neighbors is not as virtuous as one who is\nconcerned to be praise-worthy in the eyes of an impartial spectator,\nbut one who acts virtuously out of concern for legal sanctions is\nworse than either of the other two. As long as neighbors know each\nother reasonably well, their approval and disapproval will normally\ntake into account the particular circumstances, the peculiar history\nand psychology, of the individuals they judge—their judgments\nwill reflect, say, the difference in gratitude due to a loudly\nself-pitying parent as opposed to a truly long-suffering one. Legal\nsanctions are blunt instruments that cannot attend to such subtleties.\nSo social approval is more likely than legal approval to pick out the\nright sort of actions to mark for moral worth. Furthermore, since\nsocial sanctions are milder than legal sanctions—it is much\neasier to ignore a neighbor’s disapproval than a threat of\nimprisonment—people who care about social sanctions display\nbetter character than people who can be motivated to good action only\nby the law. The pressure of social sanctions is more like, and more\nlikely to draw one towards, the pressure of conscience. Even if\nconcern for social approval is not the ideal motivation for moral\naction, therefore, it is at least some sign of good character, and a\nstep along the way to the motivations of the fully virtuous person.\nLegal sanctions by contrast affect our physical well-being and social\nstanding so severely that they drive out all thought of the sanctions\nof conscience. A government concerned to foster virtue in its citizens\nshould therefore aim as much as possible to remove its own sanctions\nfrom the pursuit of virtue. Governments foster virtue best where they\nrefuse, directly, to foster virtue at all: just as they protect\neconomic development best where they refuse, directly, to protect that\ndevelopment. This ironic conception of government power runs through\nSmith’s political thinking. Accordingly, his main\npolitical object in writing WN is to instill modesty in policy-makers,\nto urge them to take on only very limited, well-defined tasks, and to\nrecognize that the flourishing of their society does not, on the\nwhole, much depend on them. \nIn sum, if Smith’s political philosophy looks like\nlibertarianism, it is a libertarianism aimed at different ends, and\ngrounded in different moral views, than that of most contemporary\nlibertarians. Today, many libertarians are suspicious of the notion\nthat individuals ought to develop virtues expected of them by others:\nbeyond, at least, those virtues that are needed for the functioning of\nthe market and the liberal state themselves. Smith does not share this\nattitude. He is far from an agnostic about what a good human life\nlooks like, let alone an enthusiast for a conception of the good life\nthat eschews virtue in favor of preference-satisfaction. He is not a\npositivist sceptical of the significance of moral argument, like\nMilton Friedman, nor a hedonist, like Bentham and his followers, nor a\nradical individualist, like the followers of Ayn Rand. Any decent\nhuman life, he believes, requires certain virtues, and depends on a\nrespect and love of individuals for the people around them. If he\nencourages governments, nevertheless, to refrain from promoting\nvirtue, that is because he thinks that social forces can effectively\nachieve that end without government help, and that legal sanctions are\nin any case useless or counter-productive for the promotion of virtue.\nSo he may arrive at some libertarian conclusions, but not in the way\nthat most libertarians do. \nSmith has an account of the nature of moral judgment, and its\ndevelopment, that is richer and subtler than Hume’s; he offers a\nprototype for modern Aristotelianism in morality; he brings out the\nimportance of the imagination to moral development as few other\nphilosophers have done; he is an early and forceful promoter of the\nnotion that history is guided largely by unintended consequences; and\nhe derives from these views an unusual variant of liberal politics.\nFew of these contributions are spelled out with the clarity and tight\nargumentation that contemporary philosophers demand of their canonical\nfigures, but Smith compensates for this weakness by the humanity and\nthoughtfulness of his views, by their detachment from metaphysical\ncommitments, and by an abundance of historical and imaginative detail.\nThe richness of his ideas, and their quiet plausibility, earn him a\nplace among the most important of modern moral and political\nphilosophers.","contact.mail":"fleischert@sbcglobal.net","contact.domain":"sbcglobal.net"}]
