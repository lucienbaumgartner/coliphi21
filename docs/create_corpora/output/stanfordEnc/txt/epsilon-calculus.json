The\nepsilon operator is a term-forming operator which replaces quantifiers\nin ordinary predicate logic. Specifically, in the calculus, a term\n\\(\\varepsilon x A\\) denotes some \\(x\\) satisfying \\(A(x)\\), if there\nis one. In Hilbert’s Program, the epsilon terms play the role of\nideal elements; the aim of Hilbert’s finitistic consistency\nproofs is to give a procedure which removes such terms from a formal\nproof. The procedures by which this is to be carried out are based on\nHilbert’s epsilon substitution method. The epsilon calculus,\nhowever, has applications in other contexts as well. The first general\napplication of the epsilon calculus was in Hilbert’s epsilon\ntheorems, which in turn provide the basis for the first correct proof\nof Herbrand’s theorem. More recently, variants of the epsilon\noperator have been applied in linguistics and linguistic philosophy to\ndeal with anaphoric pronouns.\n\nBy the turn of the century David Hilbert and Henri Poincaré\nwere recognized as the two most important mathematicians of their\ngeneration. Hilbert’s range of mathematical interests was broad,\nand included an interest in the foundations of mathematics: his\nFoundations of Geometry was published in 1899, and of the\nlist of questions posed to the International Congress of\nMathematicians in 1900, three addressed distinctly foundational\nissues. \nFollowing the publication of Russell’s paradox, Hilbert\npresented an address to the Third International Congress of\nMathematicians in 1904, where, for the first time, he sketched his\nplan to provide a rigorous foundation for mathematics via syntactic\nconsistency proofs. But he did not return to the subject in earnest\nuntil 1917, when he began a series of lectures on the foundations of\nmathematics with the assistance of Paul Bernays. Although Hilbert was\nimpressed by the work of Russell and Whitehead in their Principia\nMathematica, he became convinced that the logicist attempt to\nreduce mathematics to logic could not succeed, due in particular to\nthe non-logical character of their axiom of reducibility. At the same\ntime, he judged the intuitionistic rejection of the law of the\nexcluded middle as unacceptable to mathematics. Therefore, in order to\ncounter concerns raised by the discovery of the logical and\nset-theoretic paradoxes, a new approach was needed to justify modern\nmathematical methods. \nBy the summer of 1920, Hilbert had formulated such an approach. First,\nmodern mathematical methods were to be represented in formal deductive\nsystems. Second, these formal systems were to be proved syntactically\nconsistent, not by exhibiting a model or reducing their consistency to\nanother system, but by a direct metamathematical argument of an\nexplicit, “finitary” character. The approach became known\nas\n Hilbert's program.\n The epsilon calculus was to provide the first component of this\nprogram, while his epsilon substitution method was to provide the\nsecond. \nThe epsilon calculus is, in its most basic form, an extension of\nfirst-order predicate logic with an “epsilon operation”\nthat picks out, for any true existential formula, a witness to the\nexistential quantifier. The extension is conservative in the sense\nthat it does not add any new first-order consequences. But,\nconversely, quantifiers can be defined in terms of the epsilons, so\nfirst-order logic can be understood in terms of quantifier-free\nreasoning involving the epsilon operation. It is this latter feature\nthat makes the calculus convenient for the purpose of proving\nconsistency. Suitable extensions of the epsilon calculus make it\npossible to embed stronger, quantificational theories of numbers and\nsets in quantifier-free calculi. Hilbert expected that it would be\npossible to demonstrate the consistency of such extensions. \nIn his Hamburg lecture in 1921 (1922), Hilbert first presented the\nidea of using such an operation to deal with the principle of the\nexcluded middle in a formal system for arithmetic. These ideas were\ndeveloped into the epsilon calculus and the epsilon substitution\nmethod in a series of lecture courses between 1921 and 1923, and in\nHilbert’s (1923). The final presentation of the epsilon-calculus\ncan be found in Wilhelm Ackermann’s dissertation (1924). \nThis section will describe a version of the calculus corresponding to\nfirst-order logic, while extensions to first- and second-order\narithmetic will be described below. \nLet \\(L\\) be a first-order language, which is to say, a list of\nconstant, function, and relation symbols with specified arities. The\nset of epsilon terms and the set of formulae of \\(L\\) are defined\ninductively, simultaneously, as follows: \nSubstitution and the notions of free and bound variable, are defined\nin the usual way; in particular, the variable \\(x\\) becomes bound in\nthe term \\(\\varepsilon x A\\). The intended interpretation is that\n\\(\\varepsilon x A\\) denotes some \\(x\\) satisfying \\(A\\), if\nthere is one. Thus, the epsilon terms are governed by the following\n\naxiom (Hilbert’s “transfinite axiom”): \\[ A(x)\n\\rightarrow A(\\varepsilon x A) \\] In addition, the epsilon calculus\n\n includes a complete set of axioms governing the classical\npropositional connectives, and axioms governing the equality symbol.\nThe only rules of the calculus are the following: \nEarlier forms of the epsilon calculus (such as that presented in\nHilbert 1923) use a dual form of the epsilon operator, in which\n\\(\\varepsilon x A\\) returns a value falsifying \\(A(x)\\). The\nversion above was used in Ackermann’s dissertation (1924), and\nhas become standard. \nNote that the calculus just described is quantifier-free. Quantifiers\n\ncan be defined as follows: \\[ \\begin{align} \\exists x A(x)\n&\\equiv A(\\varepsilon x A) \\\\ \\forall x A(x) &\\equiv\nA(\\varepsilon x (\\neg A)) \\end{align} \\] The usual quantifier axioms\n\n and rules can be derived from these, so the definitions\nabove serve to embed first-order logic in the epsilon calculus. The\nconverse is, however, not true: not every formula in the epsilon\ncalculus is the image of an ordinary quantified formula under this\nembedding. Hence, the epsilon calculus is more expressive than the\npredicate calculus, simply because epsilon terms can be combined in\nmore complex ways than quantifiers. \nIt is worth noting that epsilon terms are nondeterministic. \nFor example, in a language\nwith constant symbols \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), \\(\\varepsilon x (x = a \\vee x =\nb)\\) is either \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), but the calculus leaves it entirely\nopen as to which is the case. One can add to the calculus a schema\nof extensionality, \\[ \\forall x (A(x) \\leftrightarrow B(x))\n\\rightarrow \\varepsilon x A = \\varepsilon x B \\] which asserts that\nthe epsilon operator assigns the same witness to\nequivalent formulae \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). For many applications, however,\nthis additional schema is not necessary. \nThe second volume of Hilbert and Bernays’ Grundlagen der\nMathematik (1939) provides an account of results on the\nepsilon-calculus that had been proved by that time. This includes a\ndiscussion of the first and second epsilon theorems with applications\nto first-order logic, the epsilon substitution method for arithmetic\nwith open induction, and a development of analysis (that is,\nsecond-order arithmetic) with the epsilon calculus. \nThe first and second epsilon theorems are as follows: \nFirst epsilon theorem: Suppose \\(\\Gamma \\cup \\{A\\}\\)\nis a set of quantifier-free formulae not involving the epsilon symbol.\nIf \\(A\\) is derivable from \\(\\Gamma\\) in the epsilon calculus, then\n\\(A\\) is derivable from \\(\\Gamma\\) in quantifier-free predicate\nlogic. \nSecond epsilon theorem: Suppose \\(\\Gamma \\cup \\{A\\}\\)\nis a set of formulae not involving the epsilon symbol. If \\(A\\) is\nderivable from \\(\\Gamma\\) in the epsilon calculus, then \\(A\\) is\nderivable from \\(\\Gamma\\) in predicate logic. \nIn the first epsilon theorem, “quantifier-free predicate\nlogic” is intended to include the substitution rule above, so\nquantifier-free axioms behave like their universal closures. Since the\nepsilon calculus includes first-order logic, the first epsilon theorem\nimplies that any detour through first-order predicate logic used to\nderive a quantifier-free theorem from quantifier-free axioms can\nultimately be avoided. The second epsilon theorem shows that any\ndetour through the epsilon calculus used to derive a theorem in the\nlanguage of the predicate calculus from axioms in the language of the\npredicate calculus can also be avoided. \nMore generally, the first epsilon theorem establishes that quantifiers\nand epsilons can always be eliminated from a proof of a\nquantifier-free formula from other quantifier-free formulae. This is\nof particular importance for Hilbert’s program, since the\nepsilons play the role of ideal elements in mathematics. If\nquantifier-free formulae correspond to the “real” part of\nthe mathematical theory, the first epsilon-theorem shows that ideal\nelements can be eliminated from proofs of real statements, provided\nthe axioms are also real statements. \nThis idea is made precise in a certain general consistency theorem\nwhich Hilbert and Bernays derive from the first epsilon-theorem, which\nsays the following: Let \\(F\\) be any formal system which results from\nthe predicate calculus by addition of constant, function, and\npredicate symbols plus true axioms which are quantifier- and\nepsilon-free, and suppose the truth of atomic formulae in the new\nlanguage is decidable. Then \\(F\\) is consistent in the strong sense\nthat every derivable quantifier- and epsilon-free formula is true.\nHilbert and Bernays use this theorem to give a finitary consistency\nproof of elementary geometry (1939, Sec 1.4). \nThe difficulty for giving consistency proofs for arithmetic and\nanalysis consists in extending this result to cases where the axioms\nalso contain ideal elements, i.e., epsilon terms. \nFurther reading. The original sources on the epsilon-calculus\nand the epsilon theorems (Ackermann 1924, Hilbert & Bernays 1939)\nremain available only in German. Leisenring 1969 is a relatively\nmodern book-length introduction to the epsilon calculus in English.\nThe first and second epsilon theorem are described in detail in Zach\n2017. Moser & Zach 2006 give a detailed analysis for the case\nwithout equality. The original proofs are given for axiomatic\npresentations of the epsilon-calculus. Maehara 1955 was the first to\nconsider sequent calculus with epsilon terms. He showed how to prove\nthe second epsilon theorem using cut elimination, and then\nstrengthened the theorem to include the schema of extensionality\n(Maehara 1957). Baaz et al. 2018 give an improved version of the first\nepsilon theorem. Corrections to errors in the literature (including\nLeisenring’s book) can be found in Flannagan 1975; Ferrari 1987;\nand Yasuhara 1982. A variation of the epsilon calculus based on Skolem\nfunctions, and therefore compatible with first-order logic, is\ndiscussed in Davis & Fechter 1991. \nHilbert and Bernays used the methods of the epsilon calculus to\nestablish theorems about first order logic that make no reference to\nthe epsilon calculus itself. One such example is Herbrand’s\ntheorem (Herbrand 1930; see Buss 1995, Girard 1982, and section\n2.5 of Buss 1998). This is often formulated as the statement that if\n\nan existential formula \\[ \\exists x_1 \\ldots \\exists x_k A(x_1,\n\\ldots, x_k) \\] is derivable in first-order predicate logic (without\n\n equality), where \\(A\\) is quantifier-free, then there are\nsequences of terms \\(t_{1}^1, \\ldots, t_{k}^1, \\ldots, t_{1}^n,\n\\ldots, t_k ^n\\), \n\nsuch that \\[ A(t_{1}^1, \\ldots, t_k ^1) \\vee \\ldots \\vee A(t_{1}^n,\n\\ldots, t_k^n) \\] is a tautology. If one is dealing with first-order\n\n logic with equality, one has to\nreplace “tautology” by “tautological consequence of\nsubstitution instances of the equality axioms”; we will use the\nterm “quasi-tautology” to describe such a formula. \nThe version of Herbrand’s theorem just described follows\nimmediately from the Extended First Epsilon Theorem of\nHilbert and Bernays. Using methods associated with the proof of the\nsecond epsilon theorem, however, Hilbert and Bernays derived a\nstronger result that, like Herbrand’s original formulation,\nprovides more information. To understand the two parts of the theorem\nbelow, it helps to consider a particular example. Let \\(A\\) be the\nformula \nThe first clause of the theorem below, in this particular instance,\nsays that the formula \\(A\\) above is derivable in first-order logic if\nand only if there is a sequence of terms \\(t_{1}^1, t_{3}^1, \\ldots,\nt_{1}^n, t_{3}^n\\) in the expanded language with \\(f_2\\) and \\(f_4\\)\n\nsuch that \\[ B(t_{1}^1, f_2 (t_{1}^1), t_{3}^1, f_4 (t_{1}^1,t_{3}^1))\n\\vee \\ldots \\vee B(t_{1}^n, f_2 (t_{1}^n), t_{3}^n, f_4\n(t_{1}^n,t_{3}^n)) \\] is a quasi-tautology. \nThe second clause of the theorem below, in this particular instance,\nsays that the formula \\(A\\) above is derivable in first-order logic if\nand only if there are sequences of variables \\(x_{2}^1, x_{4}^1,\n\\ldots, x_2^n, x_4 ^n\\) and terms \\(s_{1}^1, s_{3}^1, \\ldots, s_1^n,\n\ns_3 ^n\\) in the original language such that \\[ B(s_{1}^1,\nx_{2}^1, s_{3}^1, x_4 ^1 ) \\vee \\ldots \\vee B(s_1^n, x_2^n, s_3^n,\nx_4^n ) \\] is a quasi-tautology, and such that \\(A\\) is derivable from\n\n this formula using only the quantifier and idempotency\nrules described below.  \n\nMore generally, suppose \\(A\\) is any prenex formula, of the form \\[\n\\mathbf{Q}_1 x_1 \\ldots \\mathbf{Q}_n x_n B(x_1, \\ldots, x_n), \\] where\n\n \\(B\\) is quantifier-free.\nThen \\(B\\) is said to be the matrix of \\(A\\), and an\ninstance of \\(B\\) is obtained by substituting terms in the\nlanguage of \\(B\\) for some of its variables. The Herbrand normal\nform \\(A^H\\) of \\(A\\) is obtained by \nWhen we refer to an instance of the matrix of \\(A^H\\), we\nmean a formula that is obtained by substituting terms in the expanded\nlanguage in the matrix of \\(A^H\\). We can now state Hilbert and\nBernays’s formulation of \nHerbrand’s theorem. (1) A prenex formula \\(A\\)\nis derivable in the predicate calculus if and only if there is a\ndisjunction of instances of the matrix of \\(A^H\\) which is a\nquasi-tautology. \n(2) A prenex formula \\(A\\) is derivable in the predicate calculus if\nand only if there is a disjunction \\(\\bigvee_j B_j\\) of instances of\nthe matrix of \\(A\\), such that \\(\\bigvee_j B_j\\) is a quasi-tautology,\nand \\(A\\) is derivable from \\(\\bigvee_j B_j\\) using the following\nrules: \nas well as the idempotence of \\(\\vee\\) (from \\(C \\vee C \\vee D\\)\nconclude \\(C \\vee D)\\). \nHerbrand’s theorem can also be obtained by using cut\nelimination, via Gentzen’s “midsequent theorem.”\nHowever, the proof using the second epsilon theorem has the\ndistinction of being the first complete and correct proof of\nHerbrand’s theorem. Moreover, and this is seldom recognized,\nwhereas the proof based on cut-elimination provides a bound on the\nlength of the Herbrand disjunction only as a function of the cut rank\nand complexity of the cut formulas in the proof, the length obtained\nfrom the proof based on the epsilon calculus provides a bound as a\nfunction of the number of applications of the transfinite axiom, and\nthe rank and degree of the epsilon-terms occurring therein. In other\nwords, the length of the Herbrand disjunction depends only on the\nquantificational complexity of the substitutions involved, and, e.g.,\nnot at all on the propositional structure or the length of the\nproof. \nThe version of Herbrand’s theorem stated at the beginning of\nthis section is essentially the special case of (2) in which the\nformula \\(A\\) is existential. In light of this special case, (1) is\nequivalent to the assertion that a formula \\(A\\) is derivable in\nfirst-order predicate logic if and only if \\(A^H\\) is. The forward\ndirection of this equivalence is much easier to prove; in fact, for\nany formula \\(A, A \\rightarrow A^H\\) is derivable in predicate logic.\nProving the reverse direction involves eliminating the additional\nfunction symbols in \\(A^H\\), and is much more difficult, especially in\nthe presence of equality. It is here that epsilon methods play a\ncentral role. \nGiven a prenex formula, the Skolem normal form \\(A^S\\) is\ndefined dually to \\(A^H\\), i.e., by replacing existentially quantified\nvariables by witnessing functions. If \\(\\Gamma\\) is a set of prenex\nsentences, let \\(\\Gamma^S\\) denote the set of their Skolem normal\nforms. Using the deduction theorem and Herbrand’s theorem, it is\n\nnot hard to show that the following are pairwise equivalent: \\[\n\\begin{align} \\Gamma &\\text{ proves } A \\\\ \\Gamma &\\text{\nproves } A^H \\\\ \\Gamma^S &\\text{ proves }A \\\\ \\Gamma^S &\\text{\nproves } A^H \\end{align} \\]\n\n  \nA striking application of Herbrand's theorem and related methods is\nfound in Luckhardt's (1989) analysis of Roth's theorem. For a\ndiscussion of useful extensions of Herbrand's methods, see Sieg 1991.\nA model-theoretic version of this is discussed in Avigad 2002a. \nAs noted above, historically, the primary interest in the epsilon\ncalculus was as a means to obtaining consistency proofs.\nHilbert’s lectures from 1917–1918 already note that one\ncan easily prove the consistency of propositional logic, by taking\npropositional variables and formulae to range over truth values 0 and\n1, and interpreting the logical connectives as the corresponding\narithmetic operations. Similarly, one can prove the consistency of\npredicate logic (or the pure epsilon calculus), by specializing to\ninterpretations where the universe of discourse has a single element.\nThese considerations suggest the following more general program for\nproving consistency: \nFor example, consider the language of arithmetic, with symbols for\n\\(0\\), \\(1\\), \\(+\\), \\(\\times\\), \\(\\lt\\). Along with quantifier-free\naxioms defining the basic symbols, one can specify that the epsilon\nterms \\(\\varepsilon x A(x)\\) picks out the least value satisfying\n\n\\(A\\), if there is one, with the following axiom: \\[ \\tag{*} A(x)\n\\rightarrow A(\\varepsilon x A(x)) \\wedge \\varepsilon x A(x) \\le x \\]\n\n The result is a system that is strong enough to interpret\nfirst-order (Peano) arithmetic. Alternatively, one can take the\nepsilon symbol to \n\nsatisfy the following axiom: \\[ A(y) \\rightarrow A(\\varepsilon x A(x))\n\\wedge \\varepsilon x A(x) \\ne y + 1.  \\] \nIn other words, if there is any witness \\(y\\) satisfying \\(A(y)\\), the\nepsilon term returns a value whose predecessor does not have the same\nproperty. Clearly the epsilon term described by (*) satisfies the\nalternative axiom; conversely, one can check that given \\(A\\), a value\nof \\(\\varepsilon x (\\exists z \\le x A(x))\\) satisfying the alternative\naxiom can be used to interpret \\(\\varepsilon x A(x)\\) in (*). One can\n\nfurther fix the meaning of the epsilon term with the axiom \\[\n\\varepsilon x A(x) \\ne 0 \\rightarrow A(\\varepsilon x A(x)) \\] which\n\n requires that if there is no witness to \\(A\\), the\nepsilon term return 0. For the discussion below, however, it is most\nconvenient to focus on (*) alone. \nSuppose we wish to show that the system above is consistent; in other\nwords, we wish to show that there is no proof of the formula \\(0 =\n1\\). By pushing all substitutions to the axioms and replacing free\nvariables by the constant 0, it suffices to show that there is no\npropositional proof of \\(0 = 1\\) from a finite set of closed instances\nof the axioms. For that, it suffices to show that, given any finite\nset of closed instances of axioms, one can assign numerical values to\nterms in such a way that all the axioms are true under the\ninterpretation. Since the arithmetical operations \\(+\\) and \\(\\times\\)\ncan be interpreted in the usual way, the only difficulty lies in\nfinding appropriate values to assign to the epsilon terms. \nHilbert’s epsilon substitution method can be described,\nroughly, as follows: \nA finitary consistency proof is obtained once it is shown in a\nfinitarily acceptable manner that this process of successive\n“repairs” terminates. If it does, all critical formulas\nare true formulas without epsilon-terms. \nThis basic idea (the “Hilbertsche Ansatz”) was set out\nfirst by Hilbert in his 1922 talk (1923), and elaborated in lectures\nin 1922–23. The examples given there, however, only deal with\nproofs in which all instances of the transfinite axiom correspond to a\nsingle epsilon term \\(\\varepsilon x A(x)\\). The challenge was to\nextend the approach to more than one epsilon term, to nested epsilon\nterms, and ultimately to second-order epsilons (in order to obtain a\nconsistency proof not just of arithmetic, but of analysis). \nThe difficulty in dealing with nested epsilon terms can be described\nas follows. Suppose one of the axioms in the proof is the transfinite\n\naxiom \\[ B(y) \\rightarrow B(\\varepsilon y B(y)) \\] \\(\\varepsilon y\n\n B(y)\\) may, of course, occur in other formulae in the\nproof, in \n\nparticular in other transfinite axioms, e.g., \\[ A(x, \\varepsilon y\nB(y)) \\rightarrow A(\\varepsilon x A(x, \\varepsilon y B(y)),\n\\varepsilon y B(y)) \\] So first, it seems necessary to find a correct\n\n interpretation for \\(\\varepsilon y B(y)\\)\nbefore we attempt to find one for \\(\\varepsilon x A(x, \\varepsilon y\nB(y))\\). However, there are more complicated patterns in which epsilon\nterms may occur in a proof. An instance of the axiom, which plays a\nrole in determining the \n\ncorrect interpretation for \\(\\varepsilon y B(y)\\) might be \\[\nB(\\varepsilon x A(x, \\varepsilon y B(y))) \\rightarrow B(\\varepsilon y\nB(y)) \\] If \\(B\\)(0) is false, then in the first round of the\n\n procedure \\(\\varepsilon y B(y)\\)\nwill be interpreted by 0. A subsequent change of the interpretation of\n\\(\\varepsilon x A(x, 0)\\) from 0 to, say, \\(n\\), will result in an\ninterpretation of this instance as \\(B(n) \\rightarrow B\\)(0) which\nwill be false if \\(B(n)\\) is true. So the interpretation of\n\\(\\varepsilon y B(y)\\) will have to be corrected to \\(n\\), which, in\nturn, might result in the interpretation of \\(\\varepsilon x A(x,\n\\varepsilon y B(y))\\) to no longer be a true formula. \nThis is just a sketch of the difficulties involved in extending\nHilbert’s idea to the general case. Ackermann (1924) provided\nsuch a generalization using a procedure which “backtracks”\nwhenever a new interpretation at a given stage results in the need to\ncorrect an interpretation already found at a previous stage. \nAckermann’s procedure applied to a system of second-order\narithmetic, in which, however, second order terms were restricted so\nas to exclude cross-binding of second-order epsilons. This amounts,\nroughly, to a restriction to arithmetic comprehension as the\nset-forming principle available (see the discussion at the end of this\nsection). Further difficulties with second-order epsilon terms\nsurfaced, and it quickly became apparent that the proof as it stood\nwas fallacious. However, no one in Hilbert’s school realized the\nextent of the difficulty until 1930, when Gödel announced his\nincompleteness results. Until then, it was believed that the proof (at\nleast with some modifications introduced by Ackermann, some of which\ninvolved ideas from von Neumann’s (1927) version of the epsilon\nsubstitution method) would go through at least for the first-order\npart. Hilbert and Bernays (1939) suggest that the methods used only\nprovides a consistency proof for first-order arithmetic with open\ninduction. In 1936, Gerhard Gentzen succeeded in giving a proof of the\nconsistency of first-order arithmetic in a formulation based on\npredicate logic without the epsilon symbol. This proof uses\ntransfinite induction up to \\(\\varepsilon_0\\). Ackermann (1940) was\nlater able to adapt Gentzen’s ideas to give a correct\nconsistency proof of first-order arithmetic using the\nepsilon-substitution method. \nEven though Ackermann’s attempts at a consistency proof for\nsecond-order arithmetic were unsuccessful, they provided a clearer\nunderstanding of the use of second-order epsilon terms in the\nformalization of mathematics. Ackermann used second-order epsilon\nterms \\(\\varepsilon f\\ A(f)\\), where \\(f\\) is a function variable. In\nanalogy with the first-order case, \\(\\varepsilon f\\ A(f)\\) is a\nfunction for which \\(A(f)\\) is true, e.g., \\(\\varepsilon f (x + f(x) =\n2x)\\) is the identity function \\(f(x) = x\\). Again in analogy with the\nfirst-order case, one can use second-order epsilons to interpret\nsecond-order quantifiers. In particular, for any second-order formula\n\n\\(A(x)\\) one can find a term \\(t(x)\\) such that \\[ A(x)\n\\leftrightarrow t(x) = 1 \\] is derivable in the calculus (the formula\n\n \\(A\\) may have other free variables, in which case these\nappear in the term \\(t\\) as well). One can then use this fact to\ninterpret comprehension principles. In a language with\n\nfunction symbols, these take the form \\[ \\exists f \\forall x (A(x)\n\\leftrightarrow f(x) = 1) \\] for an arbitrary formula\n\n \\(A(x)\\). Comprehension is more commonly expressed in\nterms of set \n\nvariables, in which case it takes the form \\[ \\exists Y \\forall x\n(A(x) \\leftrightarrow x \\in Y), \\] asserting that every second order\n\n formula, with parameters, defines a set. \n\n Analysis,\n or second-order arithmetic, is the extension of first-order\narithmetic with the comprehension schema for arbitrary second-order\nformulae. The theory is impredicative in that it allows one\nto define sets of natural numbers using quantifiers that range over\nthe entire universe of sets, including, implicitly, the set being\ndefined. One can obtain predicative fragments of this theory\nby restricting the type of formulae allowed in the comprehension\naxiom. For example, the restriction discussed in connection with\nAckermann above corresponds to the arithmetic comprehension\nschema, in which formulae do not involve second-order\nquantifiers. There are various ways of obtaining stronger fragments of\nanalysis that are nonetheless predicatively justified. For example,\none obtains ramified analysis by associating an ordinal rank\nto set variables; roughly, in the definition of a set of a given rank,\nquantifiers range only over sets of lower rank, i.e., those whose\ndefinitions are logically prior. \nFurther Reading. Hilbert’s and Ackermann’s early\nproofs are discussed in Zach 2003; 2004. Von Neumann’s proof is\nthe topic of Bellotti 2016. Ackermann’s 1940 proof is discussed\nin Hilbert & Bernays 1970, and Wang 1963. A modern presentation is\ngiven by Moser 2006. An early application of epsilon substitution is\nthe no-counterexample interpretation (Kreisel 1951). \nIn this section we discuss the development of the epsilon-substitution\nmethod for obtaining consistency results for strong systems; these\nresults are of a mathematical nature. We cannot, unfortunately,\ndiscuss the details of the proofs here but would like to indicate that\nthe epsilon-substitution method did not die with Hilbert’s\nprogram, and that a significant amount of current research is carried\nout in epsilon-formalisms. \n\n Gentzen’s consistency proofs for arithmetic\n launched a field of research known as ordinal analysis, and\nthe program of measuring the strength of mathematical theories using\nordinal notations is still pursued today. This is particularly\nrelevant to the extended Hilbert’s program, where the\ngoal is to justify classical mathematics relative to constructive, or\nquasi-constructive, systems. Gentzen’s methods of\ncut-elimination (and extensions to infinitary logic developed by Paul\nLorentzen, Petr Novikov, and Kurt Schütte) have, in large part,\nsupplanted epsilon substitution methods in these pursuits. But epsilon\ncalculus methods provide an alternative approach, and there is still\nactive research on ways to extend Hilbert-Ackermann methods to\nstronger theories. The general pattern remains the same: \nSince the last step guarantees the consistency of the original theory,\nfrom a foundational point of view one is interested in the methods\nused to prove normalization. For example, one obtains an ordinal\nanalysis by assigning ordinal notations to steps in the\nprocedure, in such a way that the value of a notation decreases with\neach step. \nIn the 1960’s, Tait (1960, 1965, 2010) extended\nAckermann’s methods to obtain an ordinal analysis of extensions\nof arithmetic with principles of transfinite induction. More\nstreamlined and modern versions of this approach can be found in Mints\n2001 and Avigad 2002b. More recently, Mints, Tupailo, and Buchholz\nhave considered stronger, yet still predicatively justifiable,\nfragments of analysis, including theories of arithmetic comprehension\nand a \\(\\Delta^{1}_1\\)-comprehension rule (Mints, Tupailo &\nBuchholz 1996; Mints & Tupailo 1999; see also Mints 2016). Arai\n2002 has extended the epsilon substitution method to theories that\nallow one to iterate arithmetic comprehension along primitive\nrecursive well orderings. In particular, his work yields ordinal\nanalyses for predicative fragments of analysis involving transfinite\nhierarchies and transfinite induction. \nSome first steps have been taken in using the epsilon substitution\nmethod in the analysis of impredicative theories (see Arai\n2003, 2006 and Mints 2015). \nA variation on step 3 above involves showing that the normalization\nprocedure is not sensitive to the choice of updates, which is to say,\nany sequence of updates terminates. This is called strong\nnormalization. Mints 1996 has shown that many of the procedures\nconsidered have this stronger property. \nIn addition to the traditional, foundational branch of proof theory,\ntoday there is a good deal of interest in structural proof\ntheory, a branch of the subject that focuses on logical deductive\ncalculi and their properties. This research is closely linked with\nissues relevant to computer science, having to do with automated\ndeduction, functional programming, and computer aided verification.\nHere, too, Gentzen-style methods tend to dominate (see again the\n entry on proof theory).\n But the epsilon calculus can also provide valuable insights; cf. for\nexample Aguilera & Baaz 2019, or the discussion of\nHerbrand’s theorem above. \nAside from the investigations of the epsilon calculus in proof theory,\ntwo applications should be mentioned. One is the use of epsilon\nnotation in Bourbaki’s Theorie des ensembles (1958).\nThe second, of perhaps greater current interest, is the use of the\nepsilon-operator in the theorem-proving systems\n HOL\n and\n Isabelle,\n where the expressive power of epsilon-terms yields significant\npractical advantages. \nReading the epsilon operator as an indefinite choice operator\n(“an \\(x\\) such that \\(A(x)\\)”) suggests that it might be\na useful tool in the analysis of indefinite and definite noun phrases\nin formal semantics. The epsilon notation has in fact been so used,\nand this application has proved useful in particular in dealing with\nanaphoric reference. \nConsider the familiar example \nThe generally accepted analysis of this sentence is given by the\nuniversal sentence \nThe drawback is that “a donkey” suggest an existential\nquantifier, and thus the analysis should, somehow, parallel in form\nthe analysis of sentence 3 given by 4: \nbut the closest possible formalization, \ncontains a free occurrence of \\(y\\). Evans 1980 suggests that since\npronouns are referring expressions, they should be analyzed as\ndefinite descriptions; and if the pronoun occurs in the consequent of\na conditional, the descriptive conditions are determined by the\n\nantecedent. This leads to the following E-type analysis of (1): \\[\n\\begin{multline*}\\forall x ((\\mathrm{Farmer}(x) \\wedge \\exists y\n(\\mathrm{Donkey}(y) \\wedge \\mathrm{Owns}(x, y))\n\\rightarrow\\\\(\\mathrm{Beats}(x, \\iota y (\\mathrm{Donkey}(y) \\wedge\n\\mathrm{Owns}(x, y))) \\end{multline*} \\] Here, \\(\\iota x\\) is the\n\n definite description operator, so \\(\\iota y\n(\\mathrm{Donkey}(y) \\wedge \\mathrm{Owns}(x, y))\\) is “the donkey\nowned by \\(x\\);”. The trouble with this is that on the standard\nanalysis, the definite description carries a uniqueness condition, and\nso (5) will be false if there is a farmer who owns more than one\ndonkey. A way out of this is to introduce a new operator, whe\n(whoever, \n\nwhatever) which works as a generalizing quantifier (Neale, 1990): \\[\n\\begin{multline*} \\forall x ((\\mathrm{Farmer}(x) \\wedge \\exists y\n(\\mathrm{Donkey}(y) \\wedge \\mathrm{Owns}(x, y)) \\rightarrow\\\\\n(\\mathrm{Beats}(x, \\mathrm{whe}\\, y (\\mathrm{Donkey}(y) \\wedge\n\\mathrm{Owns}(x, y))) \\end{multline*} \\]\n\n  \nAs pointed out by von Heusinger (1994), this suggests that Neale is\ncommitted to pronouns being ambiguous between definite descriptions\n\\((\\iota\\)-expressions) and whe-expressions. Heusinger suggests\ninstead to use epsilon operators indexed by choice functions (which\ndepend on the context). According to this approach, the analysis of\n(1) is \nHere \\(a^*\\) is a choice function which depends on \\(i\\) and the\nantecedent of the conditional: If \\(i\\) is a choice function which\nselects \\(\\varepsilon_i y \\mathrm{Donkey}(y)\\) from the set of all\ndonkeys, then \\(\\varepsilon_{a^*}y \\mathrm{Donkey} (y)\\) selects from\nthe set of donkeys owned by \\(x\\). \nThis approach to dealing with pronouns using epsilon operators indexed\nby choice functions enable von Heusinger to deal with a wide variety\nof circumstances (see Egli and von Heusinger, 1995; von Heusinger,\n2000). \nApplications of the epsilon-operator in formal semantics, and choice\nfunctions in general, have received significant interest in recent\nyears.  Von Heusinger and Egli (2000a) list, among others, the\nfollowing: representations of questions (Reinhart, 1992), specific\nindefinites (Reinhart 1992; 1997; Winter 1997), E-type pronouns\n(Hintikka and Kulas 1985; Slater 1986; Chierchia 1992, Egli and von\nHeusinger 1995) and definite noun phrases (von Heusinger 1997,\n2004). \nFor discussion of the issues and applications of the epsilon operator\nin linguistics and philosophy of language, see B. H. Slater’s\narticle on epsilon calculi (cited in the Other Internet Resources\nsection below), and the collections von Heusinger and Egli 2000 and\nvon Heusinger and Kempson 2004. \nAnother application of epsilon calculus is as a general logic for\nreasoning about arbitrary objects. Meyer Viol (1995a) provides a\ncomparison of the epsilon calculus with Fine’s (1985) theory of\narbitrary objects. Indeed, the connection is not hard to see. Given\nthe equivalence \\(\\forall x A(x) \\equiv\\) A\\((\\varepsilon x (\\neg\nA))\\), the term \\(\\varepsilon x (\\neg A)\\) is an arbitrary object in\nthe sense that it is an object of which \\(A\\) is true iff \\(A\\) is\ntrue generally. \nMeyer Viol (1995a, 1995b) contain further proof- and model-theoretic\nstudies of the epsilon calculus; specifically intuitionistic epsilon\ncalculi.  Here, the epsilon theorems no longer hold, i.e.,\nintroduction of epsilon terms produces non-conservative extensions of\nintuitionistic logic. Other investigations of epsilon operators in\nintuitionistic logic can be found in Shirai (1971), Bell (1993a,\n1993b) and DeVidi (1995). For epsilon-operators in many-valued logics,\nsee Mostowski (1963), for modal epsilon calculus, Fitting (1975). \nFurther Reading.

The\nepsilon operator is a term-forming operator which replaces quantifiers\nin ordinary predicate logic. Specifically, in the calculus, a term\n\\(\\varepsilon x A\\) denotes some \\(x\\) satisfying \\(A(x)\\), if there\nis one. In Hilbert’s Program, the epsilon terms play the role of\nideal elements; the aim of Hilbert’s finitistic consistency\nproofs is to give a procedure which removes such terms from a formal\nproof. The procedures by which this is to be carried out are based on\nHilbert’s epsilon substitution method. The epsilon calculus,\nhowever, has applications in other contexts as well. The first general\napplication of the epsilon calculus was in Hilbert’s epsilon\ntheorems, which in turn provide the basis for the first correct proof\nof Herbrand’s theorem. More recently, variants of the epsilon\noperator have been applied in linguistics and linguistic philosophy to\ndeal with anaphoric pronouns.\n\nBy the turn of the century David Hilbert and Henri Poincaré\nwere recognized as the two most important mathematicians of their\ngeneration. Hilbert’s range of mathematical interests was broad,\nand included an interest in the foundations of mathematics: his\nFoundations of Geometry was published in 1899, and of the\nlist of questions posed to the International Congress of\nMathematicians in 1900, three addressed distinctly foundational\nissues. \nFollowing the publication of Russell’s paradox, Hilbert\npresented an address to the Third International Congress of\nMathematicians in 1904, where, for the first time, he sketched his\nplan to provide a rigorous foundation for mathematics via syntactic\nconsistency proofs. But he did not return to the subject in earnest\nuntil 1917, when he began a series of lectures on the foundations of\nmathematics with the assistance of Paul Bernays. Although Hilbert was\nimpressed by the work of Russell and Whitehead in their Principia\nMathematica, he became convinced that the logicist attempt to\nreduce mathematics to logic could not succeed, due in particular to\nthe non-logical character of their axiom of reducibility. At the same\ntime, he judged the intuitionistic rejection of the law of the\nexcluded middle as unacceptable to mathematics. Therefore, in order to\ncounter concerns raised by the discovery of the logical and\nset-theoretic paradoxes, a new approach was needed to justify modern\nmathematical methods. \nBy the summer of 1920, Hilbert had formulated such an approach. First,\nmodern mathematical methods were to be represented in formal deductive\nsystems. Second, these formal systems were to be proved syntactically\nconsistent, not by exhibiting a model or reducing their consistency to\nanother system, but by a direct metamathematical argument of an\nexplicit, “finitary” character. The approach became known\nas\n Hilbert's program.\n The epsilon calculus was to provide the first component of this\nprogram, while his epsilon substitution method was to provide the\nsecond. \nThe epsilon calculus is, in its most basic form, an extension of\nfirst-order predicate logic with an “epsilon operation”\nthat picks out, for any true existential formula, a witness to the\nexistential quantifier. The extension is conservative in the sense\nthat it does not add any new first-order consequences. But,\nconversely, quantifiers can be defined in terms of the epsilons, so\nfirst-order logic can be understood in terms of quantifier-free\nreasoning involving the epsilon operation. It is this latter feature\nthat makes the calculus convenient for the purpose of proving\nconsistency. Suitable extensions of the epsilon calculus make it\npossible to embed stronger, quantificational theories of numbers and\nsets in quantifier-free calculi. Hilbert expected that it would be\npossible to demonstrate the consistency of such extensions. \nIn his Hamburg lecture in 1921 (1922), Hilbert first presented the\nidea of using such an operation to deal with the principle of the\nexcluded middle in a formal system for arithmetic. These ideas were\ndeveloped into the epsilon calculus and the epsilon substitution\nmethod in a series of lecture courses between 1921 and 1923, and in\nHilbert’s (1923). The final presentation of the epsilon-calculus\ncan be found in Wilhelm Ackermann’s dissertation (1924). \nThis section will describe a version of the calculus corresponding to\nfirst-order logic, while extensions to first- and second-order\narithmetic will be described below. \nLet \\(L\\) be a first-order language, which is to say, a list of\nconstant, function, and relation symbols with specified arities. The\nset of epsilon terms and the set of formulae of \\(L\\) are defined\ninductively, simultaneously, as follows: \nSubstitution and the notions of free and bound variable, are defined\nin the usual way; in particular, the variable \\(x\\) becomes bound in\nthe term \\(\\varepsilon x A\\). The intended interpretation is that\n\\(\\varepsilon x A\\) denotes some \\(x\\) satisfying \\(A\\), if\nthere is one. Thus, the epsilon terms are governed by the following\n\naxiom (Hilbert’s “transfinite axiom”): \\[ A(x)\n\\rightarrow A(\\varepsilon x A) \\] In addition, the epsilon calculus\n\n includes a complete set of axioms governing the classical\npropositional connectives, and axioms governing the equality symbol.\nThe only rules of the calculus are the following: \nEarlier forms of the epsilon calculus (such as that presented in\nHilbert 1923) use a dual form of the epsilon operator, in which\n\\(\\varepsilon x A\\) returns a value falsifying \\(A(x)\\). The\nversion above was used in Ackermann’s dissertation (1924), and\nhas become standard. \nNote that the calculus just described is quantifier-free. Quantifiers\n\ncan be defined as follows: \\[ \\begin{align} \\exists x A(x)\n&\\equiv A(\\varepsilon x A) \\\\ \\forall x A(x) &\\equiv\nA(\\varepsilon x (\\neg A)) \\end{align} \\] The usual quantifier axioms\n\n and rules can be derived from these, so the definitions\nabove serve to embed first-order logic in the epsilon calculus. The\nconverse is, however, not true: not every formula in the epsilon\ncalculus is the image of an ordinary quantified formula under this\nembedding. Hence, the epsilon calculus is more expressive than the\npredicate calculus, simply because epsilon terms can be combined in\nmore complex ways than quantifiers. \nIt is worth noting that epsilon terms are nondeterministic. \nFor example, in a language\nwith constant symbols \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), \\(\\varepsilon x (x = a \\vee x =\nb)\\) is either \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), but the calculus leaves it entirely\nopen as to which is the case. One can add to the calculus a schema\nof extensionality, \\[ \\forall x (A(x) \\leftrightarrow B(x))\n\\rightarrow \\varepsilon x A = \\varepsilon x B \\] which asserts that\nthe epsilon operator assigns the same witness to\nequivalent formulae \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). For many applications, however,\nthis additional schema is not necessary. \nThe second volume of Hilbert and Bernays’ Grundlagen der\nMathematik (1939) provides an account of results on the\nepsilon-calculus that had been proved by that time. This includes a\ndiscussion of the first and second epsilon theorems with applications\nto first-order logic, the epsilon substitution method for arithmetic\nwith open induction, and a development of analysis (that is,\nsecond-order arithmetic) with the epsilon calculus. \nThe first and second epsilon theorems are as follows: \nFirst epsilon theorem: Suppose \\(\\Gamma \\cup \\{A\\}\\)\nis a set of quantifier-free formulae not involving the epsilon symbol.\nIf \\(A\\) is derivable from \\(\\Gamma\\) in the epsilon calculus, then\n\\(A\\) is derivable from \\(\\Gamma\\) in quantifier-free predicate\nlogic. \nSecond epsilon theorem: Suppose \\(\\Gamma \\cup \\{A\\}\\)\nis a set of formulae not involving the epsilon symbol. If \\(A\\) is\nderivable from \\(\\Gamma\\) in the epsilon calculus, then \\(A\\) is\nderivable from \\(\\Gamma\\) in predicate logic. \nIn the first epsilon theorem, “quantifier-free predicate\nlogic” is intended to include the substitution rule above, so\nquantifier-free axioms behave like their universal closures. Since the\nepsilon calculus includes first-order logic, the first epsilon theorem\nimplies that any detour through first-order predicate logic used to\nderive a quantifier-free theorem from quantifier-free axioms can\nultimately be avoided. The second epsilon theorem shows that any\ndetour through the epsilon calculus used to derive a theorem in the\nlanguage of the predicate calculus from axioms in the language of the\npredicate calculus can also be avoided. \nMore generally, the first epsilon theorem establishes that quantifiers\nand epsilons can always be eliminated from a proof of a\nquantifier-free formula from other quantifier-free formulae. This is\nof particular importance for Hilbert’s program, since the\nepsilons play the role of ideal elements in mathematics. If\nquantifier-free formulae correspond to the “real” part of\nthe mathematical theory, the first epsilon-theorem shows that ideal\nelements can be eliminated from proofs of real statements, provided\nthe axioms are also real statements. \nThis idea is made precise in a certain general consistency theorem\nwhich Hilbert and Bernays derive from the first epsilon-theorem, which\nsays the following: Let \\(F\\) be any formal system which results from\nthe predicate calculus by addition of constant, function, and\npredicate symbols plus true axioms which are quantifier- and\nepsilon-free, and suppose the truth of atomic formulae in the new\nlanguage is decidable. Then \\(F\\) is consistent in the strong sense\nthat every derivable quantifier- and epsilon-free formula is true.\nHilbert and Bernays use this theorem to give a finitary consistency\nproof of elementary geometry (1939, Sec 1.4). \nThe difficulty for giving consistency proofs for arithmetic and\nanalysis consists in extending this result to cases where the axioms\nalso contain ideal elements, i.e., epsilon terms. \nFurther reading. The original sources on the epsilon-calculus\nand the epsilon theorems (Ackermann 1924, Hilbert & Bernays 1939)\nremain available only in German. Leisenring 1969 is a relatively\nmodern book-length introduction to the epsilon calculus in English.\nThe first and second epsilon theorem are described in detail in Zach\n2017. Moser & Zach 2006 give a detailed analysis for the case\nwithout equality. The original proofs are given for axiomatic\npresentations of the epsilon-calculus. Maehara 1955 was the first to\nconsider sequent calculus with epsilon terms. He showed how to prove\nthe second epsilon theorem using cut elimination, and then\nstrengthened the theorem to include the schema of extensionality\n(Maehara 1957). Baaz et al. 2018 give an improved version of the first\nepsilon theorem. Corrections to errors in the literature (including\nLeisenring’s book) can be found in Flannagan 1975; Ferrari 1987;\nand Yasuhara 1982. A variation of the epsilon calculus based on Skolem\nfunctions, and therefore compatible with first-order logic, is\ndiscussed in Davis & Fechter 1991. \nHilbert and Bernays used the methods of the epsilon calculus to\nestablish theorems about first order logic that make no reference to\nthe epsilon calculus itself. One such example is Herbrand’s\ntheorem (Herbrand 1930; see Buss 1995, Girard 1982, and section\n2.5 of Buss 1998). This is often formulated as the statement that if\n\nan existential formula \\[ \\exists x_1 \\ldots \\exists x_k A(x_1,\n\\ldots, x_k) \\] is derivable in first-order predicate logic (without\n\n equality), where \\(A\\) is quantifier-free, then there are\nsequences of terms \\(t_{1}^1, \\ldots, t_{k}^1, \\ldots, t_{1}^n,\n\\ldots, t_k ^n\\), \n\nsuch that \\[ A(t_{1}^1, \\ldots, t_k ^1) \\vee \\ldots \\vee A(t_{1}^n,\n\\ldots, t_k^n) \\] is a tautology. If one is dealing with first-order\n\n logic with equality, one has to\nreplace “tautology” by “tautological consequence of\nsubstitution instances of the equality axioms”; we will use the\nterm “quasi-tautology” to describe such a formula. \nThe version of Herbrand’s theorem just described follows\nimmediately from the Extended First Epsilon Theorem of\nHilbert and Bernays. Using methods associated with the proof of the\nsecond epsilon theorem, however, Hilbert and Bernays derived a\nstronger result that, like Herbrand’s original formulation,\nprovides more information. To understand the two parts of the theorem\nbelow, it helps to consider a particular example. Let \\(A\\) be the\nformula \nThe first clause of the theorem below, in this particular instance,\nsays that the formula \\(A\\) above is derivable in first-order logic if\nand only if there is a sequence of terms \\(t_{1}^1, t_{3}^1, \\ldots,\nt_{1}^n, t_{3}^n\\) in the expanded language with \\(f_2\\) and \\(f_4\\)\n\nsuch that \\[ B(t_{1}^1, f_2 (t_{1}^1), t_{3}^1, f_4 (t_{1}^1,t_{3}^1))\n\\vee \\ldots \\vee B(t_{1}^n, f_2 (t_{1}^n), t_{3}^n, f_4\n(t_{1}^n,t_{3}^n)) \\] is a quasi-tautology. \nThe second clause of the theorem below, in this particular instance,\nsays that the formula \\(A\\) above is derivable in first-order logic if\nand only if there are sequences of variables \\(x_{2}^1, x_{4}^1,\n\\ldots, x_2^n, x_4 ^n\\) and terms \\(s_{1}^1, s_{3}^1, \\ldots, s_1^n,\n\ns_3 ^n\\) in the original language such that \\[ B(s_{1}^1,\nx_{2}^1, s_{3}^1, x_4 ^1 ) \\vee \\ldots \\vee B(s_1^n, x_2^n, s_3^n,\nx_4^n ) \\] is a quasi-tautology, and such that \\(A\\) is derivable from\n\n this formula using only the quantifier and idempotency\nrules described below.  \n\nMore generally, suppose \\(A\\) is any prenex formula, of the form \\[\n\\mathbf{Q}_1 x_1 \\ldots \\mathbf{Q}_n x_n B(x_1, \\ldots, x_n), \\] where\n\n \\(B\\) is quantifier-free.\nThen \\(B\\) is said to be the matrix of \\(A\\), and an\ninstance of \\(B\\) is obtained by substituting terms in the\nlanguage of \\(B\\) for some of its variables. The Herbrand normal\nform \\(A^H\\) of \\(A\\) is obtained by \nWhen we refer to an instance of the matrix of \\(A^H\\), we\nmean a formula that is obtained by substituting terms in the expanded\nlanguage in the matrix of \\(A^H\\). We can now state Hilbert and\nBernays’s formulation of \nHerbrand’s theorem. (1) A prenex formula \\(A\\)\nis derivable in the predicate calculus if and only if there is a\ndisjunction of instances of the matrix of \\(A^H\\) which is a\nquasi-tautology. \n(2) A prenex formula \\(A\\) is derivable in the predicate calculus if\nand only if there is a disjunction \\(\\bigvee_j B_j\\) of instances of\nthe matrix of \\(A\\), such that \\(\\bigvee_j B_j\\) is a quasi-tautology,\nand \\(A\\) is derivable from \\(\\bigvee_j B_j\\) using the following\nrules: \nas well as the idempotence of \\(\\vee\\) (from \\(C \\vee C \\vee D\\)\nconclude \\(C \\vee D)\\). \nHerbrand’s theorem can also be obtained by using cut\nelimination, via Gentzen’s “midsequent theorem.”\nHowever, the proof using the second epsilon theorem has the\ndistinction of being the first complete and correct proof of\nHerbrand’s theorem. Moreover, and this is seldom recognized,\nwhereas the proof based on cut-elimination provides a bound on the\nlength of the Herbrand disjunction only as a function of the cut rank\nand complexity of the cut formulas in the proof, the length obtained\nfrom the proof based on the epsilon calculus provides a bound as a\nfunction of the number of applications of the transfinite axiom, and\nthe rank and degree of the epsilon-terms occurring therein. In other\nwords, the length of the Herbrand disjunction depends only on the\nquantificational complexity of the substitutions involved, and, e.g.,\nnot at all on the propositional structure or the length of the\nproof. \nThe version of Herbrand’s theorem stated at the beginning of\nthis section is essentially the special case of (2) in which the\nformula \\(A\\) is existential. In light of this special case, (1) is\nequivalent to the assertion that a formula \\(A\\) is derivable in\nfirst-order predicate logic if and only if \\(A^H\\) is. The forward\ndirection of this equivalence is much easier to prove; in fact, for\nany formula \\(A, A \\rightarrow A^H\\) is derivable in predicate logic.\nProving the reverse direction involves eliminating the additional\nfunction symbols in \\(A^H\\), and is much more difficult, especially in\nthe presence of equality. It is here that epsilon methods play a\ncentral role. \nGiven a prenex formula, the Skolem normal form \\(A^S\\) is\ndefined dually to \\(A^H\\), i.e., by replacing existentially quantified\nvariables by witnessing functions. If \\(\\Gamma\\) is a set of prenex\nsentences, let \\(\\Gamma^S\\) denote the set of their Skolem normal\nforms. Using the deduction theorem and Herbrand’s theorem, it is\n\nnot hard to show that the following are pairwise equivalent: \\[\n\\begin{align} \\Gamma &\\text{ proves } A \\\\ \\Gamma &\\text{\nproves } A^H \\\\ \\Gamma^S &\\text{ proves }A \\\\ \\Gamma^S &\\text{\nproves } A^H \\end{align} \\]\n\n  \nA striking application of Herbrand's theorem and related methods is\nfound in Luckhardt's (1989) analysis of Roth's theorem. For a\ndiscussion of useful extensions of Herbrand's methods, see Sieg 1991.\nA model-theoretic version of this is discussed in Avigad 2002a. \nAs noted above, historically, the primary interest in the epsilon\ncalculus was as a means to obtaining consistency proofs.\nHilbert’s lectures from 1917–1918 already note that one\ncan easily prove the consistency of propositional logic, by taking\npropositional variables and formulae to range over truth values 0 and\n1, and interpreting the logical connectives as the corresponding\narithmetic operations. Similarly, one can prove the consistency of\npredicate logic (or the pure epsilon calculus), by specializing to\ninterpretations where the universe of discourse has a single element.\nThese considerations suggest the following more general program for\nproving consistency: \nFor example, consider the language of arithmetic, with symbols for\n\\(0\\), \\(1\\), \\(+\\), \\(\\times\\), \\(\\lt\\). Along with quantifier-free\naxioms defining the basic symbols, one can specify that the epsilon\nterms \\(\\varepsilon x A(x)\\) picks out the least value satisfying\n\n\\(A\\), if there is one, with the following axiom: \\[ \\tag{*} A(x)\n\\rightarrow A(\\varepsilon x A(x)) \\wedge \\varepsilon x A(x) \\le x \\]\n\n The result is a system that is strong enough to interpret\nfirst-order (Peano) arithmetic. Alternatively, one can take the\nepsilon symbol to \n\nsatisfy the following axiom: \\[ A(y) \\rightarrow A(\\varepsilon x A(x))\n\\wedge \\varepsilon x A(x) \\ne y + 1.  \\] \nIn other words, if there is any witness \\(y\\) satisfying \\(A(y)\\), the\nepsilon term returns a value whose predecessor does not have the same\nproperty. Clearly the epsilon term described by (*) satisfies the\nalternative axiom; conversely, one can check that given \\(A\\), a value\nof \\(\\varepsilon x (\\exists z \\le x A(x))\\) satisfying the alternative\naxiom can be used to interpret \\(\\varepsilon x A(x)\\) in (*). One can\n\nfurther fix the meaning of the epsilon term with the axiom \\[\n\\varepsilon x A(x) \\ne 0 \\rightarrow A(\\varepsilon x A(x)) \\] which\n\n requires that if there is no witness to \\(A\\), the\nepsilon term return 0. For the discussion below, however, it is most\nconvenient to focus on (*) alone. \nSuppose we wish to show that the system above is consistent; in other\nwords, we wish to show that there is no proof of the formula \\(0 =\n1\\). By pushing all substitutions to the axioms and replacing free\nvariables by the constant 0, it suffices to show that there is no\npropositional proof of \\(0 = 1\\) from a finite set of closed instances\nof the axioms. For that, it suffices to show that, given any finite\nset of closed instances of axioms, one can assign numerical values to\nterms in such a way that all the axioms are true under the\ninterpretation. Since the arithmetical operations \\(+\\) and \\(\\times\\)\ncan be interpreted in the usual way, the only difficulty lies in\nfinding appropriate values to assign to the epsilon terms. \nHilbert’s epsilon substitution method can be described,\nroughly, as follows: \nA finitary consistency proof is obtained once it is shown in a\nfinitarily acceptable manner that this process of successive\n“repairs” terminates. If it does, all critical formulas\nare true formulas without epsilon-terms. \nThis basic idea (the “Hilbertsche Ansatz”) was set out\nfirst by Hilbert in his 1922 talk (1923), and elaborated in lectures\nin 1922–23. The examples given there, however, only deal with\nproofs in which all instances of the transfinite axiom correspond to a\nsingle epsilon term \\(\\varepsilon x A(x)\\). The challenge was to\nextend the approach to more than one epsilon term, to nested epsilon\nterms, and ultimately to second-order epsilons (in order to obtain a\nconsistency proof not just of arithmetic, but of analysis). \nThe difficulty in dealing with nested epsilon terms can be described\nas follows. Suppose one of the axioms in the proof is the transfinite\n\naxiom \\[ B(y) \\rightarrow B(\\varepsilon y B(y)) \\] \\(\\varepsilon y\n\n B(y)\\) may, of course, occur in other formulae in the\nproof, in \n\nparticular in other transfinite axioms, e.g., \\[ A(x, \\varepsilon y\nB(y)) \\rightarrow A(\\varepsilon x A(x, \\varepsilon y B(y)),\n\\varepsilon y B(y)) \\] So first, it seems necessary to find a correct\n\n interpretation for \\(\\varepsilon y B(y)\\)\nbefore we attempt to find one for \\(\\varepsilon x A(x, \\varepsilon y\nB(y))\\). However, there are more complicated patterns in which epsilon\nterms may occur in a proof. An instance of the axiom, which plays a\nrole in determining the \n\ncorrect interpretation for \\(\\varepsilon y B(y)\\) might be \\[\nB(\\varepsilon x A(x, \\varepsilon y B(y))) \\rightarrow B(\\varepsilon y\nB(y)) \\] If \\(B\\)(0) is false, then in the first round of the\n\n procedure \\(\\varepsilon y B(y)\\)\nwill be interpreted by 0. A subsequent change of the interpretation of\n\\(\\varepsilon x A(x, 0)\\) from 0 to, say, \\(n\\), will result in an\ninterpretation of this instance as \\(B(n) \\rightarrow B\\)(0) which\nwill be false if \\(B(n)\\) is true. So the interpretation of\n\\(\\varepsilon y B(y)\\) will have to be corrected to \\(n\\), which, in\nturn, might result in the interpretation of \\(\\varepsilon x A(x,\n\\varepsilon y B(y))\\) to no longer be a true formula. \nThis is just a sketch of the difficulties involved in extending\nHilbert’s idea to the general case. Ackermann (1924) provided\nsuch a generalization using a procedure which “backtracks”\nwhenever a new interpretation at a given stage results in the need to\ncorrect an interpretation already found at a previous stage. \nAckermann’s procedure applied to a system of second-order\narithmetic, in which, however, second order terms were restricted so\nas to exclude cross-binding of second-order epsilons. This amounts,\nroughly, to a restriction to arithmetic comprehension as the\nset-forming principle available (see the discussion at the end of this\nsection). Further difficulties with second-order epsilon terms\nsurfaced, and it quickly became apparent that the proof as it stood\nwas fallacious. However, no one in Hilbert’s school realized the\nextent of the difficulty until 1930, when Gödel announced his\nincompleteness results. Until then, it was believed that the proof (at\nleast with some modifications introduced by Ackermann, some of which\ninvolved ideas from von Neumann’s (1927) version of the epsilon\nsubstitution method) would go through at least for the first-order\npart. Hilbert and Bernays (1939) suggest that the methods used only\nprovides a consistency proof for first-order arithmetic with open\ninduction. In 1936, Gerhard Gentzen succeeded in giving a proof of the\nconsistency of first-order arithmetic in a formulation based on\npredicate logic without the epsilon symbol. This proof uses\ntransfinite induction up to \\(\\varepsilon_0\\). Ackermann (1940) was\nlater able to adapt Gentzen’s ideas to give a correct\nconsistency proof of first-order arithmetic using the\nepsilon-substitution method. \nEven though Ackermann’s attempts at a consistency proof for\nsecond-order arithmetic were unsuccessful, they provided a clearer\nunderstanding of the use of second-order epsilon terms in the\nformalization of mathematics. Ackermann used second-order epsilon\nterms \\(\\varepsilon f\\ A(f)\\), where \\(f\\) is a function variable. In\nanalogy with the first-order case, \\(\\varepsilon f\\ A(f)\\) is a\nfunction for which \\(A(f)\\) is true, e.g., \\(\\varepsilon f (x + f(x) =\n2x)\\) is the identity function \\(f(x) = x\\). Again in analogy with the\nfirst-order case, one can use second-order epsilons to interpret\nsecond-order quantifiers. In particular, for any second-order formula\n\n\\(A(x)\\) one can find a term \\(t(x)\\) such that \\[ A(x)\n\\leftrightarrow t(x) = 1 \\] is derivable in the calculus (the formula\n\n \\(A\\) may have other free variables, in which case these\nappear in the term \\(t\\) as well). One can then use this fact to\ninterpret comprehension principles. In a language with\n\nfunction symbols, these take the form \\[ \\exists f \\forall x (A(x)\n\\leftrightarrow f(x) = 1) \\] for an arbitrary formula\n\n \\(A(x)\\). Comprehension is more commonly expressed in\nterms of set \n\nvariables, in which case it takes the form \\[ \\exists Y \\forall x\n(A(x) \\leftrightarrow x \\in Y), \\] asserting that every second order\n\n formula, with parameters, defines a set. \n\n Analysis,\n or second-order arithmetic, is the extension of first-order\narithmetic with the comprehension schema for arbitrary second-order\nformulae. The theory is impredicative in that it allows one\nto define sets of natural numbers using quantifiers that range over\nthe entire universe of sets, including, implicitly, the set being\ndefined. One can obtain predicative fragments of this theory\nby restricting the type of formulae allowed in the comprehension\naxiom. For example, the restriction discussed in connection with\nAckermann above corresponds to the arithmetic comprehension\nschema, in which formulae do not involve second-order\nquantifiers. There are various ways of obtaining stronger fragments of\nanalysis that are nonetheless predicatively justified. For example,\none obtains ramified analysis by associating an ordinal rank\nto set variables; roughly, in the definition of a set of a given rank,\nquantifiers range only over sets of lower rank, i.e., those whose\ndefinitions are logically prior. \nFurther Reading. Hilbert’s and Ackermann’s early\nproofs are discussed in Zach 2003; 2004. Von Neumann’s proof is\nthe topic of Bellotti 2016. Ackermann’s 1940 proof is discussed\nin Hilbert & Bernays 1970, and Wang 1963. A modern presentation is\ngiven by Moser 2006. An early application of epsilon substitution is\nthe no-counterexample interpretation (Kreisel 1951). \nIn this section we discuss the development of the epsilon-substitution\nmethod for obtaining consistency results for strong systems; these\nresults are of a mathematical nature. We cannot, unfortunately,\ndiscuss the details of the proofs here but would like to indicate that\nthe epsilon-substitution method did not die with Hilbert’s\nprogram, and that a significant amount of current research is carried\nout in epsilon-formalisms. \n\n Gentzen’s consistency proofs for arithmetic\n launched a field of research known as ordinal analysis, and\nthe program of measuring the strength of mathematical theories using\nordinal notations is still pursued today. This is particularly\nrelevant to the extended Hilbert’s program, where the\ngoal is to justify classical mathematics relative to constructive, or\nquasi-constructive, systems. Gentzen’s methods of\ncut-elimination (and extensions to infinitary logic developed by Paul\nLorentzen, Petr Novikov, and Kurt Schütte) have, in large part,\nsupplanted epsilon substitution methods in these pursuits. But epsilon\ncalculus methods provide an alternative approach, and there is still\nactive research on ways to extend Hilbert-Ackermann methods to\nstronger theories. The general pattern remains the same: \nSince the last step guarantees the consistency of the original theory,\nfrom a foundational point of view one is interested in the methods\nused to prove normalization. For example, one obtains an ordinal\nanalysis by assigning ordinal notations to steps in the\nprocedure, in such a way that the value of a notation decreases with\neach step. \nIn the 1960’s, Tait (1960, 1965, 2010) extended\nAckermann’s methods to obtain an ordinal analysis of extensions\nof arithmetic with principles of transfinite induction. More\nstreamlined and modern versions of this approach can be found in Mints\n2001 and Avigad 2002b. More recently, Mints, Tupailo, and Buchholz\nhave considered stronger, yet still predicatively justifiable,\nfragments of analysis, including theories of arithmetic comprehension\nand a \\(\\Delta^{1}_1\\)-comprehension rule (Mints, Tupailo &\nBuchholz 1996; Mints & Tupailo 1999; see also Mints 2016). Arai\n2002 has extended the epsilon substitution method to theories that\nallow one to iterate arithmetic comprehension along primitive\nrecursive well orderings. In particular, his work yields ordinal\nanalyses for predicative fragments of analysis involving transfinite\nhierarchies and transfinite induction. \nSome first steps have been taken in using the epsilon substitution\nmethod in the analysis of impredicative theories (see Arai\n2003, 2006 and Mints 2015). \nA variation on step 3 above involves showing that the normalization\nprocedure is not sensitive to the choice of updates, which is to say,\nany sequence of updates terminates. This is called strong\nnormalization. Mints 1996 has shown that many of the procedures\nconsidered have this stronger property. \nIn addition to the traditional, foundational branch of proof theory,\ntoday there is a good deal of interest in structural proof\ntheory, a branch of the subject that focuses on logical deductive\ncalculi and their properties. This research is closely linked with\nissues relevant to computer science, having to do with automated\ndeduction, functional programming, and computer aided verification.\nHere, too, Gentzen-style methods tend to dominate (see again the\n entry on proof theory).\n But the epsilon calculus can also provide valuable insights; cf. for\nexample Aguilera & Baaz 2019, or the discussion of\nHerbrand’s theorem above. \nAside from the investigations of the epsilon calculus in proof theory,\ntwo applications should be mentioned. One is the use of epsilon\nnotation in Bourbaki’s Theorie des ensembles (1958).\nThe second, of perhaps greater current interest, is the use of the\nepsilon-operator in the theorem-proving systems\n HOL\n and\n Isabelle,\n where the expressive power of epsilon-terms yields significant\npractical advantages. \nReading the epsilon operator as an indefinite choice operator\n(“an \\(x\\) such that \\(A(x)\\)”) suggests that it might be\na useful tool in the analysis of indefinite and definite noun phrases\nin formal semantics. The epsilon notation has in fact been so used,\nand this application has proved useful in particular in dealing with\nanaphoric reference. \nConsider the familiar example \nThe generally accepted analysis of this sentence is given by the\nuniversal sentence \nThe drawback is that “a donkey” suggest an existential\nquantifier, and thus the analysis should, somehow, parallel in form\nthe analysis of sentence 3 given by 4: \nbut the closest possible formalization, \ncontains a free occurrence of \\(y\\). Evans 1980 suggests that since\npronouns are referring expressions, they should be analyzed as\ndefinite descriptions; and if the pronoun occurs in the consequent of\na conditional, the descriptive conditions are determined by the\n\nantecedent. This leads to the following E-type analysis of (1): \\[\n\\begin{multline*}\\forall x ((\\mathrm{Farmer}(x) \\wedge \\exists y\n(\\mathrm{Donkey}(y) \\wedge \\mathrm{Owns}(x, y))\n\\rightarrow\\\\(\\mathrm{Beats}(x, \\iota y (\\mathrm{Donkey}(y) \\wedge\n\\mathrm{Owns}(x, y))) \\end{multline*} \\] Here, \\(\\iota x\\) is the\n\n definite description operator, so \\(\\iota y\n(\\mathrm{Donkey}(y) \\wedge \\mathrm{Owns}(x, y))\\) is “the donkey\nowned by \\(x\\);”. The trouble with this is that on the standard\nanalysis, the definite description carries a uniqueness condition, and\nso (5) will be false if there is a farmer who owns more than one\ndonkey. A way out of this is to introduce a new operator, whe\n(whoever, \n\nwhatever) which works as a generalizing quantifier (Neale, 1990): \\[\n\\begin{multline*} \\forall x ((\\mathrm{Farmer}(x) \\wedge \\exists y\n(\\mathrm{Donkey}(y) \\wedge \\mathrm{Owns}(x, y)) \\rightarrow\\\\\n(\\mathrm{Beats}(x, \\mathrm{whe}\\, y (\\mathrm{Donkey}(y) \\wedge\n\\mathrm{Owns}(x, y))) \\end{multline*} \\]\n\n  \nAs pointed out by von Heusinger (1994), this suggests that Neale is\ncommitted to pronouns being ambiguous between definite descriptions\n\\((\\iota\\)-expressions) and whe-expressions. Heusinger suggests\ninstead to use epsilon operators indexed by choice functions (which\ndepend on the context). According to this approach, the analysis of\n(1) is \nHere \\(a^*\\) is a choice function which depends on \\(i\\) and the\nantecedent of the conditional: If \\(i\\) is a choice function which\nselects \\(\\varepsilon_i y \\mathrm{Donkey}(y)\\) from the set of all\ndonkeys, then \\(\\varepsilon_{a^*}y \\mathrm{Donkey} (y)\\) selects from\nthe set of donkeys owned by \\(x\\). \nThis approach to dealing with pronouns using epsilon operators indexed\nby choice functions enable von Heusinger to deal with a wide variety\nof circumstances (see Egli and von Heusinger, 1995; von Heusinger,\n2000). \nApplications of the epsilon-operator in formal semantics, and choice\nfunctions in general, have received significant interest in recent\nyears.  Von Heusinger and Egli (2000a) list, among others, the\nfollowing: representations of questions (Reinhart, 1992), specific\nindefinites (Reinhart 1992; 1997; Winter 1997), E-type pronouns\n(Hintikka and Kulas 1985; Slater 1986; Chierchia 1992, Egli and von\nHeusinger 1995) and definite noun phrases (von Heusinger 1997,\n2004). \nFor discussion of the issues and applications of the epsilon operator\nin linguistics and philosophy of language, see B. H. Slater’s\narticle on epsilon calculi (cited in the Other Internet Resources\nsection below), and the collections von Heusinger and Egli 2000 and\nvon Heusinger and Kempson 2004. \nAnother application of epsilon calculus is as a general logic for\nreasoning about arbitrary objects. Meyer Viol (1995a) provides a\ncomparison of the epsilon calculus with Fine’s (1985) theory of\narbitrary objects. Indeed, the connection is not hard to see. Given\nthe equivalence \\(\\forall x A(x) \\equiv\\) A\\((\\varepsilon x (\\neg\nA))\\), the term \\(\\varepsilon x (\\neg A)\\) is an arbitrary object in\nthe sense that it is an object of which \\(A\\) is true iff \\(A\\) is\ntrue generally. \nMeyer Viol (1995a, 1995b) contain further proof- and model-theoretic\nstudies of the epsilon calculus; specifically intuitionistic epsilon\ncalculi.  Here, the epsilon theorems no longer hold, i.e.,\nintroduction of epsilon terms produces non-conservative extensions of\nintuitionistic logic. Other investigations of epsilon operators in\nintuitionistic logic can be found in Shirai (1971), Bell (1993a,\n1993b) and DeVidi (1995). For epsilon-operators in many-valued logics,\nsee Mostowski (1963), for modal epsilon calculus, Fitting (1975). \nFurther Reading.
