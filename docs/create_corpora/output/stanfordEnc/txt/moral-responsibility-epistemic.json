The\nfirst condition has to do with whether the agent possessed an adequate\ndegree of control or freedom in performing the action, whereas the\nsecond condition is concerned with whether the agent’s epistemic\nor cognitive state was such that she can properly be held accountable\nfor the action and its consequences. While the first condition prompts\nus to ask “was this person acting freely when she did\nA?”, the second condition prompts us to ask “was\nthis person aware of what she was doing (of its consequences,\nmoral significance,\n etc.)?”[1]\n \n\nThe standard assumption used to be that the philosophically\ninteresting condition was the one concerned with freedom and that, in\ncomparison, the epistemic condition (henceforth, EC) was relatively\nstraightforward and unproblematic. However, in the last twenty years\nor so it has become patent that the EC presents certain unique\nchallenges for a correct understanding of moral\nresponsibility—even distinctive skeptical threats to its\npossibility (see sect. 2)—quite independently of the issue of\nfreedom and determinism. The main purposes of this entry are, first,\nto outline in general terms what the EC is—what its requirements\nare and what kinds of awareness are involved (sect. 1)—and,\nsecond, to present the main competing positions concerning the\ninterpretation of those requirements and the different ways of\nsatisfying them (sects. 2–3).\n\nWe can start with this intuitive thought: for an agent to be\npraise-/blameworthy for an action, she must be aware of certain\nthings. Thus, what the EC seems to require, at least initially, is\nawareness. As we will see, the debate revolves around three main\nissues. First, what the content of the requisite awareness\nis, i.e., of which things an agent needs to be aware of. Second, what\nkind of awareness is required, i.e., which mental states are\ninvolved and in what way these mental states must be entertained.\nThird, whether awareness is actually required at all or whether there\ncan be, in Sher’s (2009) phrase, “responsibility without\nawareness”. For the moment we can bracket the third question and\npursue the intuitive thought that responsibility does require\nawareness. In this subsection we focus on the question about the\ncontent of awareness and in the next one on the question about the\nkind of awareness relevant for moral responsibility. \nImagine that John presses a wall button that activates a treadmill in\nwhich Mary is standing still, causing her to fall to the ground and\nbreak an arm. Let’s assume that the action is objectively wrong,\nsince it harmed Mary for no good reason, e.g., to save her from an\nincoming bullet. Now let’s try to determine what it would take\nfor John to be blameworthy for it. Assume first that John satisfies\nall non-epistemic conditions on moral responsibility, like possessing\nwhatever kind of freedom/control is required for blameworthiness. Now\nask: of which things must John be aware at the time of action in order\nto be blameworthy for it and for the ensuing consequences? There are\nfour plausible epistemic requirements involved: awareness of action,\nof moral significance, of consequences, and of alternatives.\nWe’ll take them in turn. \nFirst, the requirement of awareness of action (Mele 2010;\nSliwa 2017). To be responsible for his action, John must be aware of\nwhat he is doing. If John falsely believes that the button is a light\nswitch, then he isn’t aware that by pressing it he will start\nthe treadmill and so it seems that he can’t be blamed for\nMary’s fall and for her injuries. Similarly, if John correctly\nbelieves that pressing the button will start the treadmill but\nisn’t aware that Mary is standing on it, it seems that he\nisn’t blameworthy either. These seemings have to be refined, of\ncourse, since John’s ignorance of the button’s function or\nof Mary’s location can itself be blameworthy, in which case\n(most think) it fails to exculpate (Ginet 2000: 271). (For the classic\ndiscussion of what it takes for ignorance to be culpable see Holly\nSmith 1983 and\n sect. 2\n below. For discussions of whether culpable ignorance excuses, see\nHolly Smith 1983 and 2017; Montmarquet 1995.) The lesson, then, is\nthat for an agent to be directly blameworthy for an\naction—that is, blameworthy in a way that doesn’t derive\nfrom previous instances of blameworthiness, such as culpability for\nthe ignorance from which she acts—she must be aware that she is\nperforming the action in question, and be aware of it under an\nappropriate description (Anscombe 1963; Levy 2014: 37). In this case,\nJohn must be aware that by pressing the button he is activating the\ntreadmill with Mary on it or, alternatively, that by pressing the\nbutton and activating the treadmill he is causing Mary to fall to the\nground. (Recall that this is just a first pass on the epistemic\nrequirements on responsibility. We’ll see later on\n (sect. 3.4)\n that many philosophers deny that one must be aware of what one is\ndoing in order to be directly responsible for it.) \nSecond, the requirement of awareness of moral significance.\nFor John to be blameworthy, he has to be aware of the action’s\nmoral significance or moral valence. In other words, he must have a\nbelief about the action’s being wrong or, alternatively, a belief about the\npresence of whatever features make the action wrong (its wrong-making\nfeatures). The first kind of belief amounts to de dicto\nawareness of moral significance, because it involves awareness of the\naction’s wrongness so conceived (Haji 1997: 543;\nZimmerman 2002a; 2008: 191–2; 2017: 85; Rosen 2004: 307; Levy\n2011: 141; Sliwa 2017: 131–2). The second kind of belief amounts\nto de re awareness of moral significance, because it involves\nawareness of those features of the action that are in fact\nmorally significant, regardless of whether the agent is also\naware of the moral significance they actually have (Harman 2011: 465;\n2015: 59–60, 67; Talbert 2013: 242; Littlejohn 2014: 144; Levy\n2014: 37). If when John presses the button he entertains the belief\nthat what he is doing is overall morally wrong, he has de\ndicto awareness of the action’s moral significance. (If,\nalternatively, he believes that his action is merely pro\ntanto morally wrong but not wrong all-things-considered, he lacks\nthat awareness.) If, on the other hand, John lacks the belief about\noverall wrongness but has other beliefs about the action’s\nwrong-making features, e.g., that it will harm Mary, he has de\nre awareness of the action’s moral significance. The\nposition according to which the relevant awareness is de\ndicto awareness entails that moral knowledge (or at least moral\nbeliefs) is necessary for responsibility (Sliwa 2017), whereas the\nposition according to which the relevant awareness is de re\nawareness denies the necessity of moral knowledge (Harman 2011 &\n2015; Talbert 2013). We’ll see below\n (sect. 3.3)\n that this is a key dispute concerning the epistemic requirements on\npraise-/blameworthiness. \nThird, the requirement of awareness of consequences. In a\nnatural description of the case, we would say that John is responsible\nfor Mary’s breaking an arm, that is, that he’s blameworthy\nfor the latter\n event.[2]\n Call this the consequence of John’s action. What kind of\nawareness is required for John to be blameworthy for it? The\nstraightforward response is that he must have a belief about the event\noccurring as a result of his action (Zimmerman 1997: 420). However,\nthere is disagreement about what the content of this belief must be.\nSome philosophers (Zimmerman 1986; Vargas 2005) think that it must be\nvery specific, in the sense that the agent has to believe that an\nevent of exactly the kind that occurred could result from her\naction, whereas others (Fischer & Tognazzini 2009; King 2017: 272;\nNelkin & Rickless 2017a: 126) think that a belief with a more\ngeneral content suffices. According to the former position, for John\nto be blameworthy for the consequence of his action he must have\nentertained the belief that Mary would (or might) break her arm as a\nresult of her fall, whereas according to the latter position a belief\nthat someone would (or might) be harmed is enough. It’s worth\nnoting that the requirement of awareness of consequences is usually\nstated in terms of “reasonable foreseeability” rather than\nactual foresight (Vargas 2005; Fischer & Tognazzini 2009; Sartorio\n2017; cf. Zimmerman 1986; Nelkin & Rickless 2017a). As will become\npatent later on, the dispute about how to understand this requirement\nis part and parcel of the broader dispute about whether the EC\nrequires occurrent awareness\n (sect. 2)\n or, rather, the capacity to gain the requisite awareness (sects.\n 3.2,\n 3.4). \nFourth and finally, the requirement of awareness of\nalternatives. Some philosophers argue that an agent can’t\nbe blameworthy for a wrong action unless she believes that there is at\nleast one alternative (and permissible) course of action open to her.\nFor instance, Levy writes (see also Wieland 2017a: 2; Guerrero 2007:\n89): \nPerhaps it need not be the case … that agents need genuine\naccess to alternative possibilities when they choose and act, but they\ndo need epistemic access to a range of alternatives: they can\nonly appropriately be blamed for performing an action if they believed\nthat alternatives were available to them, and understood the\nsignificance of these alternatives. (Levy 2011: 111) \nApplying this idea to our example, John would be blameworthy only if\nhe believed that he could have pursued an alternative and permissible\ncourse of action, such as refraining from pressing the button.\nHowever, not everyone agrees that this is a genuine epistemic\nrequirement on responsibility. For instance, Sartorio (2017) argues—on the basis of\na variation on the classic Frankfurt cases (Frankfurt 1969)—that an\nagent can be blameworthy even if she believes, or even knows,\nthat she couldn’t have done otherwise, as long as this belief\ndoesn’t interfere with her own deliberation about whether to\nperform the wrong action. \nIn sum, there are four different things awareness of which seems (at\nleast initially) relevant for responsibility: awareness of one’s\naction under an appropriate description, of its moral significance, of\nits potential consequences, and of alternatives to it. Next\nwe’ll consider different positions about what mental states\namount to the requisite awareness. \nIn the previous section we identified several plausible epistemic\nrequirements on moral responsibility. They constitute the\ncontent of the awareness that, at least initially, seems to\nbe demanded by the EC. Now we’ll focus on the kind of\nawareness that is in question. We’ll pursue two questions.\nFirst, what mental states must the agent entertain in order\nto possess the relevant awareness? Second, how must the\nmental states in question be entertained (occurrently,\ndispositionally, etc.)? \nLet’s begin with the first question. It was pointed out at the\noutset that one of the alternative labels for the EC is\n‘knowledge condition’ and this may naturally suggest that\nawareness in this context is nothing but knowledge. Returning to the\nexample, this would mean that John satisfies the EC just in case he\nknew what he was doing and knew about its moral\nsignificance, its potential consequences, etc. However, many\nphilosophers have argued that knowledge proper isn’t required\nfor blameworthiness (Rosen 2008: 596; Haji 2008: 90; Peels 2014:\n493–4; Baron 2017: 58–9). To see why, consider this case\npresented by Rosen: \nDorfman poisons Mrs. Dorfman by putting what he takes to be arsenic in\nher tea. The stuff is indeed arsenic and Mrs. Dorfman dies as planned.\nBut Dorfman does not know that the stuff is arsenic (or that\nhis act subjects his victim to an unjustifiable risk of death)\nbecause: The chemist who sold Dorfman the arsenic is a famous liar\n… [G]iven the chemist’s well-known track record of\nselling sugar as arsenic to would-be poisoners, Dorfman had no\nbusiness believing him. Dorfman’s pertinent beliefs are true,\nbut they do not amount to knowledge because they are based on\ninsufficient evidence. (Rosen 2008: 596) \nThe key point is that Dorfman’s lack of knowledge about the\nwrong-making features of his action is irrelevant for assessing his\nblameworthiness, for he is as blameworthy as he would be had he knew\nthat the stuff was indeed arsenic. Therefore, whatever mental state\nDorfman was in at the time of carrying out his plan, it must suffice\nfor satisfying the EC. It’s natural to think that the relevant\nmental state is simply true belief (Peels 2014: 493). Dorfman truly\nbelieved that he was pouring arsenic into her wife’s tea and\nthat by doing so she would die, and this seems enough for him to be\nblameworthy (assuming he also satisfied other non-epistemic conditions\non responsibility). Some philosophers think that mere true belief\nisn’t enough, though, and claim that what is needed for\nsatisfying the EC is reasonable or justified belief\ninstead (Timpe 2011: 18; Ginet 2000: 270). This would entail that\nDorfman satisfies the EC only if it was reasonable for him to believe,\nor if he was justified in believing, that what the chemist handed over\nto him was indeed arsenic and thus that he would poison his wife by\npouring the substance in her tea (perhaps it was reasonable and\njustified if Dorfman had never heard about the chemist’s\nreputation as a liar). \nHowever, still other philosophers think that not only the belief in\nquestion needn’t be reasonable, but that it needn’t even\nbe true (Zimmerman 2008: 198; Haji 1997: 526; Levy 2014: 36).\nOn this view,  \nblameworthiness is affiliated not with the objective wrongness of an\naction but with whether a person takes herself to be doing wrong in\nperforming an action. (Haji 1997: 526)  \nThis entails that an agent can be blameworthy for performing a morally\nneutral, or even a morally right action (Zimmerman 2008: 201),\nprovided that she acts on the belief that her action is wrong (see the\ncase of Huckleberry Finn in\n sect. 3.3\n below). In defense of this position, it has been argued that there is\na particular kind of culpability that one incurs when one knowingly\ndefies what one takes to be the requirements of morality (Levy 2011:\n142; Zimmerman 2017: 91), regardless of whether one gets them\nright. \nAssuming that awareness involves some or another type of belief,\nlet’s turn now to the second question broached above, namely\nhow these beliefs must be entertained for the person to\npossess the relevant awareness. The main dispute here is between those\nphilosophers who think that the pertinent beliefs must be\noccurrently entertained (Zimmerman 1997: 421–2; 2017:\n79; Ginet 2000: 270; Rosen 2004: 309; Levy 2011: 141) and those who\nthink that it’s enough if these beliefs are\ndispositionally entertained (Haji 1997: 531; Peels 2011: 580;\nTimpe 2011: 18; Levy 2013: 167; 2014:\n 34).[3]\n According to the ‘occurrentist’ camp, an agent satisfies\nthe EC only if, at the time of action, she consciously believes that\nher action is right/wrong and consciously contemplates some of its\npossible consequences (Zimmerman 1997: 421). Otherwise, and for the\npurposes of attributions of responsibility, she is ignorant of\nrelevant considerations and so, in principle (recall the possibility\nof culpable ignorance), she has an excuse for her wrongdoing\n(Zimmerman 2017: 79; see\n sect. 3.1\n below for an argument in favor of this position). As we’ll see\nbelow\n (sect. 2),\n the occurrentist interpretation of the EC plays a central role in a\nrevisionist argument against commonsense attributions of\nresponsibility. \nBy contrast, the ‘dispositionalist’ camp argues that the\noccurrentist interpretation of the EC is too strict and would let too\nmany intuitively blameworthy wrongdoers off the hook. For one, if one\nforgets a relevant piece of information and as a consequence does\nsomething wrong—if, say, one forgets about the dietary\nrestrictions of the infant one is babysitting and then feeds her food\nto which she is allergic—one seems to be, absent excusing\nconditions, blameworthy (Peels 2011: 580; see also Husak 2011).\nCrucially, however, lack of occurrent belief concerning the relevant\ninformation doesn’t seem to be one of those excusing conditions (Amaya & Doris 2015: 267).\nAlso, if the occurrentist position were right, one could shield\noneself from blame simply by avoid thinking about the moral status of\none’s action, and that’s implausible (Guerrero 2007: 74;\nTimpe 2011: 23; Robichaud 2014: 150; Levy 2014: 31). These\nconsiderations lead to the position that tacit, dormant,\ndispositional, or unconscious beliefs can, at least in many cases,\namount to the kind of awareness that is required for moral\nresponsibility (see\n sect. 3.1\n below for more arguments in favor of this position). \nSo far we have pursued the intuitive idea that responsibility requires\nawareness and reviewed several positions concerning the content and\nkind of awareness that is in question. We’ll now see that this\nintuitive idea, coupled with a particular interpretation of the\ncontent and kind of the requisite awareness, leads to a regress that\nthreatens to undermine attributions of responsibility quite generally.\nThe following argument is originally due to Zimmerman (1997), who\noffered slight variations in his 2008 and 2017. Rosen (2004) and Levy\n(2011: ch. 5) have also advanced versions of it, as well as Ginet\n(2000), although the latter fails to note its revisionist\nimplications. We’ll call the proponents of this argument\n‘volitionists’, and the position they espouse concerning\nthe EC ‘revisionism’. The volitionists’ argument\nsparked a big debate in which the three central questions concerning\nthe EC mentioned at the outset—about the content, kind, and\nnecessity of awareness—have been thoroughly explored. This\nsection presents a reconstruction of the regress argument and the next\none presents the main responses to it. \nTo appreciate how the regress is generated, consider the variation of\nour initial example in which John falsely believes that the wall\nbutton is a light switch. Since John isn’t aware that by\npressing the button he is activating the treadmill, he fails to\nsatisfy the requirement of awareness of action under an appropriate\ndescription and, a fortiori, he also fails to satisfy the\nrequirements concerning awareness of moral significance and of\nconsequences. Therefore, since John is unaware that pressing the\nbutton is wrong (or, alternatively, unaware of the action’s\nwrong-making features) and is also unaware of the potential\nconsequences of doing so, we may think that, at least in principle, he\nis blameworthy neither for his action nor for Mary’s injuries.\nJohn’s unawareness or, as it’s often put, John’s\nignorance would play the role of an excuse for his\nwrongdoing, where an excuse is a consideration that blocks the\nattribution of blame to an agent who has performed a wrong action\n(Austin 1957 [1962]; Kelly 2012; Franklin 2013. For detailed\ndiscussions of the ignorance excuse see Rosen 2008; Peels 2014; Baron\n2017). As it was noted above, however, John’s ignorance can\nitself be blameworthy or culpable, and it’s\nwidely—although not universally (cf. Holly Smith 2017; Ross\n1939: 163–4)—accepted that culpable ignorance fails to\nexculpate (at least completely). Thus, it if turns out that John is\nculpable for his ignorance of the button’s true function, he\nmight well be blameworthy for unwittingly activating the treadmill and\nfor unwittingly causing Mary’s injuries. Notice that if this\nwere the case, John’s blameworthiness for his unwitting action\nand its consequences would be derivative (or\nindirect) rather than original (or direct):\nit would derive from a prior instance of blameworthiness, namely his\nblameworthiness for his ignorant state (Zimmerman 1997: 414–5;\nRosen 2004: 300). (See King 2017 for criticism of the idea that\nblameworthiness for unwitting wrongdoing must be explained in terms of\nthe original/derivative distinction, and see Wieland and Robichaud\n2017 for a thorough discussion of different ways of cashing out the\nidea that there is a “transfer” of blame in these\ncases.) \nSo now the crucial question becomes: What would it take for John to be\nblameworthy for his ignorance? John’s ignorance of the fact that\nhis action is wrong is rooted in his mistaken belief that the button\nis a light switch, so it seems that if he is blameworthy for his\nignorance it must be because he is blameworthy for having this belief\nor for lacking the correct belief about the button’s\n function.[4]\n So what would it take for John to be blameworthy for having certain\nbeliefs or lacking others? In answering this question volitionists\nappeal to the thesis of doxastic involuntarism, according to which we\nlack direct control over our beliefs, that is, we can’t decide\nat will what to believe (Williams 1973; Alston 1988; Zimmerman 2002a;\nRosen 2004: 302; Levy 2007; 2011: 128–31). So if John is\nblameworthy for having or lacking certain beliefs, this must be\nbecause there was something John did such that: i) he had\ndirect control over it; ii) it caused him to have or lack certain\nbeliefs; iii) doing such a thing is all-things-considered wrong; and\niv) he is blameworthy for having done it. (Notice that, on this view,\nresponsibility for ignorance is also derivative.) The natural\ncandidate that satisfies clauses i to iii is what Holly Smith (1983)\ncalls a “benighting act”: an action or omission the\nconsequence of which is the lack of a true belief about the\nimpermissibility of one’s conduct. In other words, by performing\na benighting act the agent brings about her own ignorance about the\nwrongness of her subsequent action. In our example we can imagine\nseveral benighting acts John may have performed, such as discarding\n(without reading it first) the operational booklet that was given to\nhim when he was hired at the fitness center, not asking a colleague to\nshow him around before touching anything, not reading the conspicuous\n“Caution: activates treadmill” sign placed above the\nbutton, etc. \nAny of these actions and omissions satisfies clauses i to iii above:\ni) John has direct control over keeping (and reading) a booklet or\nreading a sign or asking questions; ii) John’s failure to\nperform at least one of these actions caused him to lack a true belief\nabout the button’s function; and iii) any of these actions and\nomissions is, in the relevant context, all-things-considered wrong,\nsince John was under a ‘procedural epistemic obligation’\n(Rosen 2004: 301) to inform himself about the functioning of the\nplace. Wrongness, however, isn’t the same as blameworthiness, so\nwe still need to know (clause iv) if John is blameworthy for any of\nthese benighting acts (H. Smith 1983: 548). The natural thought at\nthis point is that culpability for a benighting act requires exactly\nthe same as culpability for any other act (Zimmerman 1997: 416).\nTherefore, if we started from the idea that responsibility requires\nawareness, we’ll conclude that one is blameworthy for a\nbenighting act only if, at the time of performing it, one is aware of\nwhat one is doing, of its moral significance, of its potential\nconsequences, and of alternatives to it. This entails that John is\nblameworthy for any of the benighting acts described above only if\neither he performed any of them in full awareness (including awareness\nof the probable consequence of leaving him ignorant of relevant\nconsiderations) or, if this wasn’t the case, he is in\nturn blameworthy for this further lack of awareness. \nIt becomes clear at this point that in trying to establish\nJohn’s blameworthiness for the original action we are facing a\nregress. John would be blameworthy for his unwittingly activating the\ntreadmill and its consequences only if his ignorance of the\nbutton’s function was itself culpable, which in turn requires\nthat such ignorance derives from a culpable action or\nomission (a benighting act). But culpability for a benighting act\nagain seems to require awareness, so if John’s omissions to\ninform himself were also unwitting—if he was also ignorant or\nunaware of the need to read the operational booklet, say—we\nwould need to search for further benighting acts to which we\ncould trace back this extra piece of ignorance. For the regress to\nterminate, the agent’s ignorance must be at some point the\ncausal upshot of an action or omission performed in full awareness of\nall the relevant facts (including the relevant moral facts.\nSee below). As Rosen puts it, \nHe would have to know the pertinent facts about his contemplated act.\nHe would have to know that it was wrong. And he would have to know\nthat in the circumstances, all things considered, he should not do it.\nHe would then have to act despite this knowledge. (Rosen 2004:\n307) \nAn action performed in this way would be an akratic action,\nthat is, an action performed while occurrently and de dicto\n(Rosen 2004: 309) believing that it’s all-things-considered\nwrong to do it. It thus follows from the regress argument that\n“the only possible locus of original responsibility is an\nakratic act” (Rosen 2004: 307), and this entails that every\nblameworthy action must be either itself an akratic action or the\ncausal upshot of one (Zimmerman [2008: 176] calls the second disjunct\n‘the Origination Thesis’). This is the ‘akrasia\nrequirement’ on blameworthiness defended by volitionists. The\nakrasia requirement is a surprising result with troubling revisionist\nimplications, because when we make ordinary judgments of\nblameworthiness we rarely (if ever) check to see whether it is met\n(Zimmerman 2017: 84). According to the argument, however, we should,\nfor if it isn’t met attributions of blame are mistaken. And the\nproblem isn’t merely that the soundness of the argument would\nforce us to take extra steps before blaming others; rather, the\nproblem is that it can be speculated that ignorant wrongdoing very\nrarely has such non-ignorant (or akratic) origins (Zimmerman 1997:\n418; Levy 2011: 131). Moreover, it has been argued that it would be\nvery difficult, or even impossible, for us to ascertain whether the akrasia requirement has been met on any particular occasion (Rosen 2004: 308). In either case,\nthe upshot is that many, perhaps most, of our ordinary judgments of blameworthiness for ignorant\nwrongdoing are unwarranted. \nAnd indeed things can get worse, for volitionists claim that this\nargument applies to all kinds of ignorance, not just factual\nignorance as in John’s example (Zimmerman 1997: 423; Rosen 2003;\n2004: 304; Levy 2011:\n 118–23).[5]\n Consider a variant of the case in which John is aware that pressing\nthe button will activate the treadmill and foresees as well that doing\nso might cause Mary to fall and sustain an injury (and even intends\nthis to be the case). But suppose that John doesn’t believe, and\nso isn’t aware, that harming Mary is wrong, perhaps because he\nwas raised in an extremely sexist society in which it’s widely\nassumed that men are allowed to harm women in response to perceived\nthreats to their manhood (think of the many places in which\n‘honor killings’ against women are still considered\nacceptable). In this variant, John acts from moral ignorance,\nnot factual ignorance, and yet volitionists claim that since John is\nunaware that what he’s doing is wrong, the argument applies to\nhim in this variant as well: he is blameworthy for his action only if\nhe is blameworthy for his (moral) ignorance, and he is blameworthy for\nthe latter only if it derives from a blameworthy benighting act, such\nas knowingly refusing to question his sexist beliefs. If these\nconditions aren’t met, volitionists claim that John is excused,\nbecause according to them non-culpable ignorance, be it factual or\nmoral, always exculpate. This is what Rosen (2003) calls the\n‘Parity Thesis’. (Husak 2016 offers a book-length defense\nof the idea that legal ignorance also excuses, which has\nseveral points in common with the volitionists’ position. See\nYaffe 2018 for criticism.) \nRosen (2004: 305–6; see also Levy 2011: 141) even claims that if\nan agent is aware that her contemplated act is morally wrong but\nfails to believe that it’s all-things-considered wrong,\nperhaps because she believes that sometimes self-interest trumps\nmorality, she also acts from ignorance (in this case, ignorance of\n‘the rational force of moral considerations’), which means\nthat the regress argument also applies to her. Thus, volitionists\nthink that ignorant wrongdoing is extremely widespread (especially because they think that lack of occurrent belief counts as ignorance), and\nthis is why the regress argument applies to all wrongdoers except for\nakratic ones. Therefore, the argument ultimately threatens to\nundermine attributions of responsibility quite\n generally.[6] \nIt seems to most philosophers that something has gone awry at this\npoint, for (the assumption seems to be) it can’t be the case\nthat the requirements of the EC are so stringent that most ordinary\nwrongdoers, particularly morally ignorant ones (Schnall 2004:\n308), fail to meet them and so turn out to be blameless after all\n(FitzPatrick 2008: 610; Peels 2011: 578; Clarke 2014: 162). The\nchallenge is to articulate what exactly is wrong with the regress\nargument. It will be useful to spell out its four main theses: \nIn the next section we’ll survey the main responses to the\nregress argument. Each of these responses denies one or more of the\nargument’s main theses and, in so doing, develop alternative\ninterpretations of the EC. (See Wieland 2017a for another presentation\nof the competing positions in this debate.) \nVolitionists argue that the intuitive thought that responsibility\nrequires awareness, pursued to its ultimate consequences, subverts\nordinary judgments of blameworthiness. So, in order to respond to the\nrevisionist interpretation of the EC, that intuitive thought needs to\nbe reexamined. Responses to revisionism vary according to how much\nthey are willing to depart from it. Some philosophers agree that\nresponsibility requires awareness, but argue that the requisite\nawareness doesn’t necessarily involve an occurrent\nbelief concerning the action’s overall wrongness\n (sect. 3.1,\n ‘Weakened internalism’). Other philosophers claim that,\nwhile awareness of wrongdoing is required for culpability for actions,\nsuch awareness isn’t required when it comes to assessing\nculpability for ignorance itself\n (sect. 3.2,\n ‘Ignorance and epistemic vices’). A third group maintains\nthat the required awareness concerns only the factual aspects of\none’s action, not the moral ones, at least not conceived in a\nde dicto way\n (sect. 3.3,\n ‘Quality of will’). Finally, some philosophers contend\nthat in certain cases awareness isn’t required at all: agents can be blameworthy for fully unwitting acts\nprovided that certain other conditions are met\n (sect. 3.4,\n ‘Capacitarianism’). Despite their differences, what these\npositions have in common is the goal of denying the akrasia\nrequirement on blameworthiness. \nThe most conservative strategy for attacking the revisionist\ninterpretation of the EC accepts the bulk of the regress argument\n(theses i, ii and iv) but denies that occurrent awareness of\nwrongdoing (that is, clear-eyed akrasia) is necessary for\nblameworthiness (thesis iii). According to this position, a weaker\nkind of awareness—constituted by dispositional,\ndormant, tacit, or unconscious beliefs—is all that the EC\nrequires (Haji 1997; Peels 2011; Timpe 2011; Husak 2011; Levy 2013\n& 2014: ch. 2; Nelkin & Rickless 2017a: 127). Other proponents\nof this strategy deny that the content of the requisite\nawareness must involve a belief in the action’s overall\nwrongness and claim that a belief in there being sufficient reasons\nnot to perform the action (Robichaud 2014), a belief in one’s\nacting from morally reproachable reasons (Sartorio 2017), or a belief\nin there being a non-negligible risk that one’s action is wrong\n(Guerrero 2007; Nelkin & Rickless 2017a), can be enough for\nblameworthiness. (See also Levy 2014 [ch. 2] who claims that\nresponsibility requires awareness of the facts that give the\naction its moral valence rather than awareness of moral wrongness. Cf.\nLevy 2011 [ch. 6, esp. 141] and\n fn. 3\n above.) We’ll call this position ‘weakened\ninternalism’: ‘internalism’ because, like\nvolitionism, it assumes that what the EC requires is the presence of\ncertain mental states that track the action’s moral valence as\nit appears to the agent (Levy 2009); ‘weakened’ because,\nunlike volitionism, it allows for the possibility that non-occurrent\nmental states, as well as beliefs that fall short of full-blown\nakrasia, satisfy the EC. \nIn defense of the volitionist position, Zimmerman offers this argument: \nif a belief is not occurrent, then one cannot act either with the\nintention to heed the belief or with the intention not to heed it; if\none has no such intention, then one cannot act either deliberately on\nor deliberately despite the belief; if this is so, then the belief\nplays no role in the reason for which one performs one’s action;\nand one incurs culpability for one’s action only if one’s\nbelief concerning wrongdoing plays a role in the reason for which one\nperforms the action. (1997: 421–2) \nIn reply, the weakened internalist argues that it’s false that only occurrent\nbeliefs play a role in the reasons for which one acts, and so\nit’s false that an occurrent belief concerning wrongdoing is\nnecessary for knowingly doing wrong (Peels 2011: 581–2). Take a non-moral example first: one can decide to go to the park because one occurrently\nbelieves that a break from work is in order, while also (albeit\ndispositionally) believing that the park is a nice place, that\none’s friends frequently gather at the park, that there are\noften amusing performances taking place there, etc. All these beliefs\ncan play a role in the reasons for which one decides to go to the\npark, even though they are dispositional rather than occurrent.\nSomething similar holds in cases of wrongdoing: returning to our\nexample, suppose that while John is preparing his attack on Mary, the\nonly beliefs he occurrently holds concern various aspects of his plan\nand ways of carrying it out undetected. Still, he may hold the\ndispositional belief that what he is planning to do is wrong and, just\nas in the park example, this belief can play a role in the reasons for\nwhich he does wrong (for instance, John may decide to proceed with\nthis plan despite dispositionally believing it’s wrong to do\nso). It thus seems that John is blameworthy despite his belief about\nwrongdoing not being occurrent (Timpe 2011: 23; Levy 2014: 31). If\nthis is correct, then clear-eyed akrasia isn’t necessary for\nblameworthiness. \nThis contention can be bolstered by appealing to cases of\nself-deception (Haji 1997: 537–9). Suppose that Susan is\ndeliberating whether to pay her taxes. Lately she has been spending\nsignificant amounts of time with some libertarian (in the political\nsense) friends who try to convince her that she has no obligation to\npay taxes because the government is illegitimate. Susan doesn’t\nfind their arguments very convincing, but her strong desire to fit in\nleads her to form a conscious judgment that she shouldn’t pay\nher taxes. At the same time, however, she has an unconscious or\ndispositional belief that it’s all-things-considered wrong not\nto pay taxes. If Susan ends up not paying taxes, it seems correct to\nsay that she did so despite her (dispositional) belief that\nher omission is all-things-considered wrong. So this belief did play a\nrole in the reasons for which she acted, even though it was merely\ndispositional (recall that, according to Zimmerman, a belief plays a\nrole in one’s reasons if one either acts on the belief\nor despite the belief). Susan was “unconsciously\naware” (Haji 1997: 544) that not paying taxes is wrong and this,\naccording to the weakened internalist, suffices for satisfying the\nrequirement of awareness of moral significance and thus for Susan to\nbe blameworthy. So, once again, clear-eyed akrasia isn’t\nnecessary for blameworthiness. On the further assumption that\ndispositional beliefs about wrongdoing are much more common than\noccurrent ones, the weakened internalist position would have shown\nthat the revisionist consequences of the regress argument aren’t\nas severe as originally thought. \nAnother line of argument exploited by weakened internalists denies\nthat the content of the requisite awareness must involve a\nbelief in the action’s overall wrongness. For instance, Guerrero\n(2007: 78) argues that if an agent is unsure whether the action she is\nplanning to undertake is permissible or not, and so admits the\npossibility that it might well be wrong, she can be\nblameworthy for carrying it out even in the absence of clear-eyed akrasia and even if her ignorance (which is manifested here as lack of certainty) is blameless.\n(Thus Guerrero, unlike other weakened internalists, deny thesis i of\nthe regress argument, since in his view ignorant wrongdoing can be\nculpable in the absence of culpable ignorance.) This is because there\nis an independently plausible moral principle that urges restraint in\nthe face of uncertainty regarding the potential harms that our actions\nmight bring about (2007:\n79). Similarly, Nelkin and Rickless (2017a: 121–2) claim that\nbeing aware of doing something that poses a risk of forgetting\nrelevant information can anchor responsibility for unwitting wrongdoing, even in the absence of an\nakratic decision to assume the risk. \nIn turn, Robichaud (2014) claims that a belief in there being\nsufficient (albeit not decisive) reasons to perform an action\nsatisfies the requirement of awareness of moral significance, which\nentails that one can be blameworthy for performing an action one\nbelieves there are sufficient (albeit not decisive) reasons to avoid.\n(Relatedly, Sartorio [2017: 24–8] argues that one can be\nblameworthy if one is aware that one is acting from morally\nreproachable reasons, regardless of whether one is also aware that\none’s action is overall morally wrong.) In so arguing, Robichaud\ndenies an important implicit assumption in the regress argument,\nnamely that an agent can rationally comply with an obligation (moral\nor epistemic), and thus can reasonably be expected to do so, only if\nshe believes that she ought to comply with it and therefore believes\nshe has decisive reasons in its favor (Levy 2009). On the contrary,\nRobichaud argues that for a course of action to be rationally open for\nan agent it isn’t necessary that she believes she has decisive\nreasons in its favor; a belief concerning sufficient reasons is enough\n(Robichaud 2014: 142). See Levy 2016 for criticism. \nThe next position we’ll consider goes a step further in\nrejecting the idea that responsibility requires awareness. According\nto this position, ignorant wrongdoers can be culpable for their\nignorance (and for actions performed out of it) even if the benighting acts that produced it were\nthemselves performed out of ignorance of their wrongness. For this to be\nthe case, it is claimed, is sufficient if in performing benighting\nacts agents exhibit epistemic vices that explain why they\nfailed to improve their epistemic position. On this view, then, the\nregress in the volitionists’ argument doesn’t necessarily\nterminate in an episode of clear-eyed akrasia; it can also terminate\nin epistemically vicious conduct, regardless of whether the agent\nconceives it as such (Montmarquet 1995 & 1999; FitzPatrick 2008\n& 2017). Notice that this position is less conservative than\nweakened internalism, since in the latter view culpability for\nignorance requires awareness that one has sufficient reasons to comply\nwith certain epistemic obligations (Robichaud 2014: 145). By contrast,\nin the position currently under review no such awareness is required:\nan agent’s epistemic vices might blind her to these reasons, and\nyet she can be blameworthy for ignorance resulting from her failure to\ncomply with her epistemic obligations (Montmarquet 1999: 845;\nFitzPatrick 2008: 606). \nPhilosophers who espouse this position thus deny thesis ii of the\nregress argument (according to which ignorance is culpable only if it\nderives from a benighting act performed in awareness of its wrongness)\nand, consequently, also deny thesis iii (that responsibility requires\noccurrent and de dicto beliefs about the action’s\noverall wrongness), but only regarding benighting acts. So\nthey in effect posit an asymmetry in the epistemic requirements on\nblameworthiness: while blameworthiness for ordinary actions does\nrequire awareness of wrongdoing, blameworthiness for benighting acts\nand subsequent ignorance doesn’t (FitzPatrick 2008: 609; see\nLevy 2009: 741 for criticism of this asymmetry). A further consequence\nis that they accept thesis i (that blameworthiness for actions\nperformed out of ignorance is always derivative) for all actions\nexcept for benighting acts (FitzPatrick 2008: 609 n.37; 2017: 32); and\naccept thesis iv as well (that both factual and moral ignorance can\nexculpate) (FitzPatrick 2008: 602; 2017: 35). \nFitzPatrick (2008) illustrates this position with the case of Mr.\nPotter, a powerful businessman who engages in ruthless business\npractices while thinking they are “permissibly\naggressive”, therefore acting from ignorance of their wrongness.\nFitzPatrick (2008: 601, 609) agrees with volitionists that Mr. Potter\nis blameworthy for his ruthless business behavior only if (and\nbecause) he is blameworthy for the ignorance from which he acts; and\nalso agrees that if it turned out that he’s blameless for the\nlatter, he’d be blameless for the former as well (2008: 602).\nBut FitzPatrick sharply disagrees with volitionists on the conditions\nthat must be satisfied for ignorance to be culpable. In his view,\nignorance is culpable when it results from the violation of epistemic\nobligations regarding which the agent could reasonably have been\nexpected to comply given her cognitive capacities and the\nopportunities provided by her social context, and when such violation\nis due to the agent’s epistemic vices such as\n“overconfidence, arrogance, dismissiveness, laziness, dogmatism,\nincuriosity, self-indulgence, contempt, and so on” (2008: 609).\nAccording to FitzPatrick, when this is the case the agent bears direct\nresponsibility for her ignorance even if her benighting acts—i.e.,  the acts that evinced the epistemic vices just listed —were themselves performed out of ignorance of their\nwrongness. (FitzPatrick’s position, according to which culpability for unwitting wrongdoing is partially explained by the fact that the ignorant\nagent should and could have known better has important similarities\nwith the capacitarian view discussed in\n sect. 3.4\n below.) \nThis conception of culpable ignorance has been criticized on the\ngrounds that it isn’t reasonable to expect epistemically vicious\nagents like Mr. Potter to do anything substantial to avoid or remedy\ntheir ignorance, at least not in the sense of ‘reasonable\nexpectation’ relevant for attributions of responsibility (Levy\n2009; Talbert 2013: 230–3). Levy argues that agents are\nblameworthy only “if it is reasonable to expect them to conform\ntheir behavior to the appropriate normative standards” and this,\nin turn, requires that “conforming their behavior to normative\nstandards is something they can do rationally (and not merely by\nchance or accident)” (2009: 735). However, Levy argues, the\nnotion of rationality relevant here is a “thoroughly internalist\none”, having to do with “what I can decide to do as the\nresult of engaging in reasoning”, that is, by deliberating on\nthe reasons I think I have for pursuing different courses of action\n(2009: 735). But in this internalist sense of ‘rational’,\nit isn’t rational for Mr. Potter to do anything to correct his\nmoral outlook, given that by his lights the challenges to it that he\nencounters can rightly be dismissed as irrelevant. Levy concedes that\nin so thinking Mr. Potter exhibits epistemic vices, “but because\nhe does not conceive of them as vices, he has no internal\nreason” for mending his ways and so it isn’t reasonable to\nexpect him to do so (2009: 737). (See FitzPatrick 2017 for his\nresponse.) \nIn his arguments against the akrasia requirement on culpable\nignorance, Montmarquet goes further than FitzPatrick in that he denies\nthe thesis of doxastic involuntarism that plays an important role in\nthe regress argument. While FitzPatrick’s objective is to\nestablish direct culpability for “epistemically debilitating\nchoices” (2008: 609, italics added),\nMontmarquet’s main claim is that culpability for\nbeliefs themselves can be “fundamental and\nunderived” (1995: 43). This is because, in his view, agents\npossess “direct (albeit incomplete) control” (1999: 844)\nover the formation of their beliefs. He agrees with volitionists that\n \nif an agent is culpably ignorant of some fact, there will always have\nbeen some possible act or omission, but for which this ignorance would\nnot have existed, (1995: 42)  \nbut he thinks that talk of benighting acts distracts us from the true\nsource of culpable ignorance, which is an “intellectually\nirresponsible attitude” and associated beliefs rather than\n“the acts and omissions to which that attitude and those beliefs\nled [the agent]” (1995: 43). \nIn order to support his contention that agents can be directly\nculpable for holding certain beliefs, Montmarquet (1999: 844) argues,\nagainst Zimmerman 1997, that agents can in fact directly control their\nbeliefs by exercising direct control over the degree of care with\nwhich they form them. He offers the analogy of whistling carefully:\none can directly control the care one exerts in whistling, but this\ndoesn’t imply that the whistling itself is only indirectly in\none’s control; on the contrary, one directly controls both. If the analogy holds, given that agents can\ndirectly control how careful they are in forming their beliefs, they\ncan also directly control their beliefs themselves and so it would follow that agents\ncan be directly blameworthy for forming beliefs carelessly and for the\ncarelessly formed beliefs themselves. In response, Zimmerman (2002a; 2008:\n183–9) points out a disanalogy between the cases of whistling\ncarefully and forming beliefs carefully: while whistling is itself an\naction, believing something isn’t an action but a (mental)\nstate, which can be the result of the action of taking care\nin forming beliefs. However, since we don’t have direct control\nover the results of our non-basic actions (taking care in forming\nbeliefs being one of them), Zimmerman concludes that we lack direct\ncontrol over our beliefs and so we can’t be directly responsible\nfor them (2008: 188–9). \nWe turn now to examine a family of views that resist the regress\nargument by appealing to Strawson’s (1962 [2003]) influential\nidea that praise-/blameworthiness tracks the agent’s quality of\nwill. There are different ways of cashing out what exactly\n‘quality of will’ means (Shoemaker 2013), but the basic\nidea is this: an agent is praiseworthy for an action or an\nattitude that accords with the demands of morality if the performance\nof the action or the holding of the attitude arises from proper regard\nor concern for another person’s morally significant interests.\nConversely, an agent is blameworthy for an action or attitude that\nconflicts with the demands of morality if the performance of the\naction or the holding of the attitude arises from lack of proper\nregard or concern for those same interests. The key insight that\nquality-of-will theorists bring to bear on the debate over the EC is\nthat an agent need not believe that her action is right/wrong\n(or that she has reasons in favor or against doing it, or that she is\ndoing something morally risky) for the action to express the quality\nof her will and thus for her to be praise-/blameworthy in performing\nit. For example, when an ancient slaveholder beats her slave she\nclearly evinces lack of regard for the slave’s interests, quite\nirrespectively of what her owns views about the permissibility of\nslavery are or whether she has ever paused to consider the issue\n(Rosen 2003: 72). Thus, if an agent’s evinced quality of will is\nall that matters for blameworthiness (something that Rosen denies),\nthe slaveholder is manifestly blameworthy. On this view, then, de\ndicto awareness of the action’s moral significance\nisn’t required for blameworthiness (Fields 1994; Arpaly 2003\n& 2015; Harman 2011 & 2015; Talbert 2013 & 2017a; Littlejohn 2014; Mason\n2015; Björnsson 2017b), and the same goes for praiseworthiness\n(Arpaly 2003 &\n 2015).[8],\n [9] \nWhat kind of awareness is required according to quality-of-will\ntheorists? In their view, when assessing epistemic requirements on\nresponsibility  \nwe should consider what a wrongdoer needs to know in order for her\nactions to express the attitudes and judgments that make blame\nappropriate. (Talbert 2013: 242)  \nQuality-of-will theorists usually agree that for actions to express\nthe relevant attitudes and judgments factual awareness is\nrequired: the agent has to be aware of what she is doing and what the\nprobable consequences of her action are (Talbert 2017a: 47, 53; Harman\n2011: 465; 2015: 67; Arpaly 2015: 151). (Angela Smith 2005 & 2017\ndisagrees, arguing that failures of factual awareness, such as\nforgetting a friend’s birthday, sometimes reveal inadequate\nmoral concern and thus are blameworthy. See also Björnsson 2017b:\n152. Cf. Holly Smith 2011; Talbert 2017b.) As we just saw, they also\nagree that de dicto moral awareness isn’t required.\nHowever, they disagree on whether de re moral awareness—awareness of the\naction’s right-/wrong-making features regardless of whether one\nconceives them as such—is required or not. Some think it is (Talbert 2013: 242; 2017a: 53; Harman 2011: 465; 2015: 67), while others think it isn’t.  \nThe clearest advocate of the latter position is Arpaly (2003 & 2015). In\nher view, quality of will is essentially related to responsiveness to\nmoral reasons, understood as  \n[wanting] noninstrumentally to take courses of action that have those features\nthat are (whether or not [one] describes them this way) right-making and not to take courses of action that have those features\nthat are (whether or not [one] describes them this way) wrong-making features.\n(Arpaly 2003: 79)  \nThe key claim Arpaly defends is that responding in this sense to moral\nreasons doesn’t require awareness of the features to which one\nis responding. Her central example is the much-discussed case of\nHuckleberry Finn, who helps Jim the runaway slave to escape despite\nbelieving that he is acting wrongly in “stealing” from\nJim’s “owner”. Huck does the right thing and,\naccording to Arpaly, does it for the right reasons, namely in response\nto Jim’s humanity (Arpaly 2003: 77). At the same time, however,\nHuck is unaware that he is helping Jim because he is a person\nlike himself (although he is aware that he is facilitating\nJim’s flight). He “is not capable of bringing to\nconsciousness his nonconscious awareness” of Jim’s\nhumanity (Arpaly 2003: 77), and thus fails to acquire de re\nawareness of the central right-making feature of his action. Since\nHuck seems to be praiseworthy despite lacking moral awareness (both\nde dicto and de re), Arpaly concludes that this kind\nof awareness isn’t required for praiseworthiness, and something\nparallel holds for blameworthiness (Arpaly 2015: 151–2). \nNot everyone agrees with Arpaly’s verdict on this case, however.\nSliwa (2017) challenges the intuition that Huck is morally\npraiseworthy, arguing that praise is ordinarily bestowed only on those\nagents who intentionally do the right thing. Given that Huck\ndoesn’t know what the right thing to do in his situation is, he\ncan’t do the right thing intentionally (although he\nintentionally performs an action that is in fact right), because\nintentional action incorporates, quite generally, a “know\nhow” requirement (Sliwa 2017: 128–30). Since in the case\nof morally significant actions the required know-how incorporates both\nnon-moral and moral knowledge (2017: 131), this, on Sliwa’s\nview, supports the thesis that praise-/blameworthiness does require\nmoral knowledge (and thus moral awareness). (Zimmerman 2008: 201\nargues that Huck is actually blameworthy, given that he acts\non the belief that his action is overall morally wrong.) \nIt’s important to emphasize the extent of the disagreement\nbetween quality-of-will theorists and volitionists. The former\ninitially reject thesis iii of the regress argument, since they deny\nthat de dicto awareness of the action’s moral\nsignificance is necessary for praise-/blameworthiness. But this\nrejection ultimately leads them to deny all four of the\nregress argument’s main theses. Since quality-of-will theorists\nmaintain that moral knowledge isn’t required for\npraise-/blameworthiness, they thus hold that moral ignorance (even if\nblameless) doesn’t stand in the way of either praise or blame,\ntherefore denying thesis iv (the Parity Thesis) (Harman 2011: 465; 2015:\n65; Talbert 2013: 242; Arpaly 2015: 151). Also, since in their view\nwhat matters for blameworthiness is whether the agent exhibits ill\nwill in performing some action, blameworthiness for ignorant\nwrongdoing can be direct—it needn’t derive from\nculpability for ignorance. This amounts to a rejection of thesis i\nwhen moral ignorance is at stake (Harman 2011 & 2015; Talbert\n2013; Arpaly 2015). Finally, and in opposition to thesis ii, some\nquality-of-will theorists claim that moral ignorance can be directly\nblameworthy, given that one’s mistaken moral beliefs may reveal\nan inadequate degree of moral concern (Harman 2011: 460; 2015: 68; see\nalso Adams 1985: 19. Cf. Arpaly 2003: 105–6). Thus, after rejecting\nall the basic theses of the regress argument, quality-of-will\ntheorists conclude that culpability for ignorant wrongdoing (and for\nignorance itself) is much more prevalent than volitionists think. \nFor instance, on Talbert’s (2013 & 2017a) account it will\noften be the case that morally ignorant wrongdoers are blameworthy,\nbecause \n[e]ven if a wrongdoer is ignorant of the fact that her behavior is\nwrong, and even if this ignorance is not her fault, her actions may\nstill express the contemptuous judgment that certain others do not\nmerit consideration, that their interests do not matter, and that\ntheir objections can be overlooked. (Talbert 2013: 234) \nTalbert concedes that if a wrongdoer’s moral ignorance\nisn’t her fault, it may well be the case that she’s unable\nto rationally do the right thing. But far from showing that\nshe’s thus blameless, what this shows according to Talbert is\nthat “having subjective rational access to avoiding an action is\nnot a requirement on being properly blamed for that action”\n(Talbert 2013: 239; cf. Björnsson 2017b: 149). This stands in\nsharp opposition to one of the volitionists’ central\nconvictions—a conviction that grounds their commitment to the\nimportance of de dicto moral awareness—namely that\n“It is unfair to blame someone for doing something if he\nblamelessly believes that there is no compelling moral reason not to\ndo it” (Rosen 2003: 74; see also Levy 2009: 738). Talbert\nresponds to the charge of unfairness by claiming that there is nothing\nunfair in blaming someone who knowingly (in the factual sense) and\ndeliberately has harmed us, even if we concede that it isn’t\nreasonable to expect her to have avoided her moral ignorance and acted\nrightly (Talbert 2013: 238; 2017a: 53. See also Scanlon 2008:\n186–8; Arpaly 2003: 172–3; 2015: 155; Harman 2015: 66).\nHowever, by divorcing blameworthiness from reasonable expectations\nabout avoiding wrongdoing, Talbert’s position, and that of other\nquality-of-will theorists, is vulnerable to the charge that it misses\nthe crucial connection between blameworthiness and desert, namely that blameworthy agents deserve\ncertain negative reactions and adverse treatment partly because, and\nonly if, it was reasonable to expect them to do better (FitzPatrick\n2017: 33; Levy 2011: 194–5). \nIt becomes apparent at this point that the disagreement between\nquality-of-will theorists and the rest concerning the EC is ultimately\ngrounded on different conceptions of responsibility and\nblameworthiness (Wieland 2017a: 5; see the\n Conclusion\n below). On the one hand, philosophers of different persuasions\nregarding the EC—volitionists, weakened internalists, epistemic\nvice theorists, and capacitarians—appeal to elements associated\nwith responsibility as accountability, such as the relevance\nof the agent’s capacities and opportunities to avoid wrongdoing\nand the concomitant reasonable expectations. (Of course, they disagree\nabout how to characterize these elements, and this disagreement partly\nexplains why they have different conceptions of the EC. See for\ninstance the exchanges between FitzPatrick 2008 & 2017 and Levy\n2009 & 2011: ch. 5; between Clarke 2017a and Levy 2017; and\nbetween Robichaud 2014 and Levy 2016.) On the other hand,\nquality-of-will theorists appeal to elements associated with\nresponsibility as attributability, such as the centrality of\nthe agent’s “moral orientation” (Talbert 2017a: 48)\nor “deep self” (Wolf 1987) for blameworthiness and the\ncomparative irrelevance of historical factors about how the agent came\nto have the moral orientation or deep self she has (Arpaly 2003:\n172–3; Harman 2011: 462; Talbert 2017b: 19) or whether she could\nhave avoided wrongdoing (Scanlon 2008: 186–8; Talbert 2017a:\n48). For the distinction between different types of responsibility see\nWatson 1996, Shoemaker 2011, and Zimmerman 2015. \nThe fourth type of response to the regress argument is the one that\ndeparts more radically from the idea that responsibility requires\nawareness. According to it, agents can be directly blameworthy not\nonly for actions and omissions performed out of moral ignorance, but\nalso for actions and omissions performed out of factual ignorance;\nthat is, for fully unwitting wrongful conduct. (Recall that\nquality-of-will theorists restrict their claims to morally ignorant\nwrongdoing. Again, exceptions are Angela Smith 2005 & 2017 and\nBjörnsson 2017b.) Since what all the adherents to this position\nhave in common is the idea that blameworthiness in these cases is\nlargely (though not exclusively) explained by the presence of certain\ncapacities possession of which makes the agent capable of acquiring\nthe relevant awareness, their position can be dubbed\n‘capacitarianism’. In their view, the best formulation of\nthe EC is disjunctive (Sher 2009: 87): agents satisfy the epistemic\nrequirements on responsibility either if they are aware of the\nrelevant factual and moral considerations or if they should and\ncould be aware of them given the available evidence, the opportunity to adequately process it, and their\ncognitive capacities. Capacitarians differ on what else (if anything)\nhas to be added to the second disjunct, but they all agree that a\ncentral element in the explanation of blameworthiness for ignorant\nwrongdoing is the fact that the agent should and could have known\nbetter than she did (FitzPatrick 2008 & 2017; Sher 2009; Clarke\n2014 & 2017a, b; Murray 2017; Rudy-Hiller\n 2017; Amaya & Doris 2015; Murray & Vargas 2018 [Other Internet Resources]; Vargas 2018 [Other Internet Resources]).[10] \nAn important motivation for this view is to account for cases in which\npeople seem to be blameworthy for unwitting omissions despite the fact\nthat: i) the omissions and attendant failures of awareness\naren’t explicable in terms of ill will; and ii) blameworthiness\ncan’t be traced back to a previous failure to discharge some\nobligation (Sher 2017b). Staple cases of this sort are forgetting\ncases, such as this one (see also Clarke 2014: 164–5): \nHot Dog. Alessandra, a soccer mom, has gone to pick up her\nchildren at their elementary school. As usual, Alessandra is\naccompanied by the family’s border collie, Bathsheba, who rides\nin the back of the van. Although it is very hot, the pick-up has never\ntaken long, so Alessandra leaves Sheba in the van while she goes to\ngather her children. This time, however, Alessandra is greeted by a\ntangled tale of misbehavior, ill-considered punishment, and\nadministrative bungling which requires several hours of indignant\nsorting out. During that time, Sheba languishes, forgotten, in the\nlocked car. When Alessandra and her children finally make it to the\nparking lot, they find Sheba unconscious from heat prostration. (Sher\n2009: 24) \nIn this example, Alessandra is intuitively blameworthy for omitting to\nlet the dog out of the van. But her wrongful omission is fully\nunwitting: she’s unaware not only of its wrongness but even of\nthe fact that she’s omitting to do something she ought to do in\nthe first place. Importantly, as the case is described there is no\nreason to think that Alessandra’s omission stems from ill will\ntowards the dog or towards those who love the dog, such as her\nchildren (Sher 2009: 37, 91; see also Clarke 2017a: 246; King 2009:\n584–5; Amaya & Doris 2015: 266; Murray 2017: 516). Rather, what explains her failure of awareness\nisn’t flawed character traits or lack of regard for morally\nsignificant interests, but simply the cognitive and emotional load\nplaced upon her by the unusual situation at the school (Sher 2009:\n131), which, by assumption, wasn’t overwhelming enough to excuse\nher for her omission (see Amaya & Doris 2015: 263). Finally, it’s implausible to try to account for\nAlessandra’s blameworthiness by positing a previous failure to\ndischarge some obligation of due care—like setting the alarm on\nher phone to remind her of the dog—since the situation was\nunpredictable (Sher 2009: 35–6) and intending to let the dog\nstay in the car for a couple of minutes doesn’t seem to be wrong\n(cf. Nelkin & Rickless 2017a who claim that in this sort of cases\nthere usually is a previous violation of an obligation\nrelated to preventing the episode of forgetfulness). The omission in\nquestion is just a regrettable but, according to capacitarians,\nculpable mistake (Amaya & Doris 2015; Murray 2017: 516). So if\nintuitions about responsibility in this sort of cases aren’t\nmisleading, neither awareness nor ill will are necessary for\nblameworthiness. (Levy [2017] and Talbert [2017b] offer empirically-based\nerror theories according to which intuitions in these\ncases are misleading because people tend to misattribute lack\nof moral concern to unwitting wrongdoers based solely on the\nconsequences of their actions, and this mistaken attribution is then\nused as grounds for blaming them. But Murray et al. [forthcoming] provide contrary empirical evidence suggesting that what\ndrives ordinary people to assign responsibility in forgetting cases is\nmainly the presence of an adequate opportunity to remember rather than the level of concern the forgetful agent displayed toward what she was supposed to do.) \nThe challenge for capacitarians is then to explain three things: i)\nwhat norms support the claim that unwitting wrongdoers\nshould have known better; ii) what capacities\njustify the assumption that unwitting wrongdoers could have\nknown better; and iii) why its being true that an unwitting wrongdoer\nshould and could have known better grounds responsibility for\nunwitting\n wrongdoing.[11] \nBefore going into the details of how capacitarians answer these\nquestions, let’s see what theses of the regress argument are\ndenied by them. All capacitarians (with the exception of FitzPatrick,\nsee fn. 10) reject theses i and iii, since they are united in the\nbeliefs that blameworthiness for unwitting conduct can be direct and\nneedn’t trace back to culpable ignorance (against thesis i), and\nalso that factual awareness—and a fortiori occurrent\nand de dicto moral awareness—isn’t necessary for\ndirect responsibility (against thesis iii). Since capacitarians\nusually focus on factual rather than on moral ignorance, they usually\nleave thesis iv (Parity) untouched (but see Sher 2017a). However, they\nseem to be committed to accepting it, given that a crucial aspect of\nthe capacitarian view is that agents are excused for their unwitting\nwrongdoing whenever isn’t reasonable to expect them to know\nbetter due to an unfavorable epistemic situation (Sher 2017a; Clarke\n2017a: 242; Murray 2017: 515, 521; Rudy-Hiller 2017: 408). But since\nsometimes a situation is epistemically unfavorable for forming correct\nmoral beliefs (FitzPatrick 2017: 34–6), it follows from\nthe capacitarian view that at least in some such circumstances agents\nare excused for not knowing better in moral matters (FitzPatrick 2008:\n602). Finally, there is disagreement among capacitarians whether\nthesis ii (that blameworthiness for ignorance is necessarily\nderivative) is true or not. Clarke (2014: 171, 173; 2017a:\n245–6) tentatively accepts it, since he thinks that failures of\nawareness aren’t culpable if they don’t result from a\nculpable benighting action or omission. At the same time, he denies\nthat culpability for ignorant wrongdoing necessitates culpability for\nthe underlying ignorance (Clarke 2017a: 246), thus avoiding the\nregress in the volitionists’ argument. In Clarke’s view,\nthen, an agent can be blameworthy for an unwitting wrongful action\neven if the ignorance from which she acts isn’t culpable, as\nlong as such ignorance is substandard—and therefore faulty\n(Clarke 2017a: 245). (Note that the soundness of this move rests on the\ndefensibility of the distinction between culpable and faulty ignorance.\nSee Rudy-Hiller [2017: 416] for criticism.) By contrast, Rudy-Hiller\n(2017: 413) rejects thesis ii, since he claims that an agent is\ndirectly blameworthy for her ignorance if she is capable of gaining\nthe required awareness and there is no significant impediment to the\nexercise of the relevant cognitive capacities. \nLet’s return now to the three central questions capacitarians\nmust answer to give plausibility to their view. The first concerns the\nnature of the norms of awareness supporting the claim that certain\nunwitting wrongdoers should have known better. The central function of\nthese norms is to set a standard against which failures of awareness\nare evaluated to determine which ones are defective and which\ndon’t. When failures of awareness aren’t defective, it\nisn’t the case that the involved agents should have known better\nand thus they are excused for their unwitting wrongdoing.\nCapacitarians agree that norms of awareness are sensitive to the\nagent’s cognitive capacities and circumstances (Sher 2009: 110;\nClarke 2014: 167; Murray 2017: 516; Rudy-Hiller 2017: 413; FitzPatrick\n2017: 37). They also agree that these norms are derivative,\nin the sense that both their content (the considerations agents should\nbe aware of) and their normative force (their bindingness on agents)\ncome from another set of norms, namely moral ones. In other words, it’s because\nawareness of certain considerations is necessary for fulfilling moral\nobligations that such awareness can be demanded of agents (Sher 2009:\n111–2; Murray 2017: 515). \nIt’s crucial to note that the norms of awareness capacitarians\nrely on to substantiate should-have-known allegations aren’t\nduties of inquiry. While norms of awareness directly demand awareness\nof relevant considerations, duties of inquiry impose obligations to\nundertake information-gathering actions that contribute to the\noccurrence of such awareness (Rosen 2004: 302; 2008: 600–1; H.\nSmith 2014; Wieland 2017a: 6–8). In other words, while norms of\nawareness are concerned with agents’ states of mind,\nduties of inquiry are concerned with agents’\n activities.[12]\n This naturally generates the following worry concerning norms of\nawareness: given that “becoming aware is not something we do but\nsomething that happens to us” (Sher 2009: 112; see also Rosen\n2004: 302; 2008: 600), one might wonder whether the should-have-known\ncriterion can be used to undergird blameworthiness after all. If\nfailures of awareness escape the agent’s direct control, how\ncould it be true that such involuntary failures partly explain\ndirect responsibility for unwitting wrongdoing? (Nelkin 2011: 679–80;\nNelkin & Rickless 2015). \nCapacitarians have different responses to this worry. Sher (2009:\n147–8) ultimately rejects the control condition on moral\nresponsibility in favor of an origination requirement (see below).\nClarke, who holds on to the control condition, denies that norms of\nawareness give rise to moral obligations; in his view, they merely set\na standard for evaluating failures of awareness as faulty or not\n(2014: 167). Rudy-Hiller (2017: 418) advances a notion of control\naccording to which agents do have responsibility-relevant control over\ntheir states of awareness and so they can be morally obligated to\nremember or notice morally significant considerations. Finally, Murray\n(2017) describes, and offers empirical evidence for, a distinctive\n‘vigilance’ capacity that enables agents to become aware\nof relevant considerations and which, according to him, affords them\ndirect control over the degree of awareness they display. \nThe second central question for capacitarians is which capacities make\nit true that an unwitting wrongdoer could have known better. Clarke\noffers the following characterization of them: \nSome are capacities to do things that are in a plain sense active: to\nturn one’s attention to, or maintain attention on, some matter;\nto raise a question in one’s mind or pursue some line of\ninquiry; to make a decision about whether to do this or that. Others,\nthough capacities to do things, aren’t capacities whose exercise\nconsists in intentional action. These include capacities to remember,\nto think of relevant considerations, to notice features of one’s\nsituation and appreciate their normative significance, to think at\nappropriate times to do things that need doing. (2017a: 242) \nCapacitarians then appeal to the idea of unexercised capacities to\nexplain why certain unwitting wrongdoers could have been aware of\nrelevant considerations: it’s because those wrongdoers possess\nthe requisite cognitive capacities, but failed to exercise them\ndespite the absence of significant impediments, that they could have\nknown better (Clarke 2017a: 242; 2017b: 67; Murray 2017: 520;\nRudy-Hiller 2017: 407; Vargas 2018: 15 [Other Internet Resources]). \nSeveral objections can be raised at this point. First, notice that\neven cognitive capacities that issue in intentional actions (such as\nraising a question in one’s mind) don’t provide direct\ncontrol over awareness of relevant considerations but only\nfavor its occurrence, which remains out of one’s\ncontrol (Rosen 2004: 302; Montmarquet 1999: 845). So, under the\nassumption that control is required for responsibility, it remains\nunclear how failures of awareness contribute to explaining direct\nblameworthiness for unwitting wrongdoing (Nelkin & Rickless 2015.\nFor a similar objection stated in terms of choice rather than control,\nsee Moore & Hurd 2011: 164). Second, and relatedly, the claim that\npossession of these capacities ground reasonable expectations of the\nsort that are relevant for attributions of responsibility (Clarke\n2017a: 242; 2017b: 67) can be disputed, for since the exercise of some\nof these capacities isn’t under our control, whether they are\ndisplayed or not is a chance occurrence and chance occurrences\ncan’t ground reasonable expectations (Levy 2017: 255. Clarke\n2017a: 249–50 offers a brief response to this objection). \nThird and finally, it has been doubted whether capacitarians have a\nconvincing story about what it takes to have the relevant unexercised\ncognitive capacities (Levy 2014: 124–5; Moore & Hurd 2011:\n160–1). Sher, for instance, relies on a counterfactual account\nof capacities, according to which saying that someone was capable of\nnoticing, remembering, thinking of something, etc., “is only to\nsay that he would have remembered [noticed, thought of] in an\nappropriate range of alternative situations” (2009:\n114, italics added). The crucial task is of course to define what the\nappropriate range is, since, intuitively, one\ndoesn’t have a capacity to X if one would only very rarely\nsuccessfully X in a range of relevant scenarios. For instance, it\nmight be argued that Alessandra can’t be credited with the\npossession of the relevant cognitive capacity if we assume, plausibly,\nthat she would only very rarely remember the dog in a range of similar\nsituations to the one she actually confronted. If one were to respond\nthat it suffices for attributing the relevant unexercised capacity\nthat there is a counterfactual scenario in which Alessandra\ndoes remember the dog, this would objectionably lower the bar for\nattributing unexercised capacities, with the consequence that many\nintuitively blameless unwitting wrongdoers would turn out to be\nblameworthy after all (Levy 2014: 125). (See Vargas 2013 [ch. 7] and Vargas 2018 [Other Internet Resources] for a version of the counterfactual account that attempts to give more precision to the ‘appropriate range’ criterion for attributing unexercised capacities.) \nAlternatively, some capacitarians attribute unexercised capacities by\nappealing not to counterfactual scenarios but to the agent’s\npast performances in similar situations (Clarke 2014: 166; 2017a: 244;\nRudy-Hiller 2017: 407–8). This move raises problems of its own,\nhowever, since, on the one hand, an agent might possess a relevant\ncognitive capacity—for instance a quite good capacity to\nremember certain considerations—despite the fact that she\noften fails to exercise it perhaps because she doesn’t care much\nabout those considerations (Nelkin & Rickless 2015; see also\nNelkin & Rickless 2017a: 112–3). On the other hand, an\nagent’s past performances aren’t necessarily a good proxy\nfor attributing her a certain unexercised capacity now, since\ndespite her previous successes she might have lost the relevant\ncapacity in the meantime and so it would be unfair to fault her for\nher current lack of awareness (Sher 2009: 109). \nThe third central question for capacitarians is why the truth of the\nshould-and-could-have-known-better clause contributes to explaining\nblameworthiness for unwitting wrongdoing and what, if anything, has to\nbe added to the explanation. Sher states the worry in this way: \nthe reason the agent’s actual awareness seems significant is\nthat it implies that the act’s being wrong or foolish is among\nthe total set of considerations in light of which he chose to perform\nit. To whatever extent his choice was in this way knowing as well as\nwilling, the act, qua instance of wrong or foolish behavior, is in a\nsuitably deep sense his own. However, and in stark contrast, when an\nagent merely should be aware that he is acting wrongly or foolishly,\nthere is no comparably direct connection between the wrongness or\nfoolishness of what he does and his informed will. Hence, where no\nactual awareness is involved, the standard rationale for holding him\nresponsible does not appear to be available. (Sher 2009: 74) \nAnother way of putting the worry is this: since attributions of\nresponsibility are usually anchored in some morally relevant feature\nof the agent to which awareness contributes, such as choice or\ngood/ill will (Amaya & Doris 2015: 254), an account of\nresponsibility for unwitting wrongdoing in which neither choice nor\nthe agent’s quality of will are implicated runs the risk of\nappearing ad hoc (King 2009: 587). So the challenge for\ncapacitarians is to show that their account isn’t ad\nhoc and, at the same time, to provide a “morally plausible\ndesert basis for blame” in cases of unwitting wrongdoing (Moore\n& Hurd 2011: 160). \nWe’ll focus on Sher’s response to this challenge.\nConcerning the charge of ad hocness, Sher argues that, quite\ngenerally, the crucial morally relevant feature implicated in\nattributions of responsibility isn’t choice, control, or quality\nof will but origination, understood as an appropriate causal\nrelation between the agent and her action’s right-/wrong-making\nfeatures (Sher 2009: 147; 2017b: 9–10). So, in Sher’s\nview, in order to appropriately praise or blame an agent for an action\nit must be the case that its relevant moral features are suitably\nconnected to her (Sher 2009: 82). One way in which this suitable\nconnection occurs is when the agent is aware of those features and\nchooses to perform the action in light of them, thus making the action\n“in a suitably deep sense his own” (2009: 74). Another way\n(in the case of wrong\n acts)[13]\n in which the suitable connection occurs is when the agent’s\nunawareness of the action’s wrong-making features is defective\nin the sense indicated above and such unawareness is caused\nby the agent’s constitutive attitudes, dispositions, and traits.\nWhen this is the case, Sher claims, the action’s wrongness is\nsuitably connected to the agent and so—assuming that she\nsatisfies other non-epistemic conditions as well—she can\njustifiably be held responsible for her unwitting wrongdoing (2009:\n86–8, 118). For instance, if we assume that Alessandra could\nhave recalled the dog, and also that her failure to do so was caused\nby constitutive features of her psychology such as her solicitousness\nto her children and her anxiety about conflict (2009: 92), she\nsatisfies Sher’s EC and so she’s blameworthy for her\nunwitting omission (assuming, again, that she satisfies other\nnon-epistemic conditions as well). Thus, by appealing to a single\nnotion—origination—that allegedly grounds responsibility\nboth in cases of witting and unwitting wrongdoing, Sher meets the\ncharge of ad hocness. \nThis isn’t enough, however, for it still must be shown that this\npurely causal origination relation is a morally plausibly desert basis\nfor blame. Sher (2009) claims that it is, because the psychological\nfeatures he classifies as constitutive of the agent—her cares,\nvalues, beliefs and emotional makeup, but also her patterns of mental\nassociation, “the speed and accuracy of [her] inferences and\ndecision-making” (2009: 86) and even “the relevant\nneurophysiological mechanisms” (2009: 122) that produce her\nthoughts and actions—“sustain her normal patterns of\nintellectual functioning” (2009: 122) and make her a responsible\nagent (2009: 121), and so in reacting to her failures of awareness\n(and subsequent wrongdoing) caused by those psychological features we\nare reacting to the whole person as the source of those failures\n(2009: 92). Sher (2009: 91; 2017b: 10) emphasizes that the\npsychological features that cause failures of awareness and explain\nthe agent’s blameworthiness needn’t be moral flaws\nthemselves. For instance, Alessandra’s solicitousness to her\nchildren isn’t a moral flaw; it may even be a good\ntrait, and yet it remains true that if it caused Alessandra’s\nunawareness it partially explains her blameworthiness for her\nomission. In sum, Sher’s view is that the origination relation\nexplains why blaming unwitting wrongdoers is appropriate because it\nensures that the whole person was implicated in the wrongdoing for\nwhich she is blamed. \nHowever, many authors have found this aspect of Sher’s position\nproblematic. Levy claims that while it’s very plausible that\norigination is a condition on moral responsibility, it\nisn’t plausible to think “that responsibility\nconsists in origination” (2014: 127). The fact that an\nagent’s failure of awareness causally originates in her\npsychology doesn’t seem to warrant blaming her for the action or\nomission’s wrongness, since the latter isn’t\nlinked to her in a way the shows anything about the quality of her\nwill (Levy 2014: 128; see also Talbert 2017a: 57; Björnsson\n2017b: 143). Similarly, while agreeing with Sher that agents can\nsometimes be held directly responsible for their failures of awareness and\nsubsequent wrongdoing, Angela Smith (2010) argues that this is so only when those\nfailures exhibit a rational connection to the agent’s\nevaluative judgments. By contrast, a purely causal connection\nof the sort Sher defends “cannot establish the right\nkind of connection between an agent and her wrongdoing”\nto justify blaming her for it (A. Smith 2010: 523). Finally, Moore and\nHurd (2011: 184) object that while the moral relevance of conscious\nchoice for blameworthiness is intuitively clear, it isn’t at all\nclear how the fact that the agent’s “psychophysical\napparatus that characteristically causes her chosen actions also\ncaused her on this occasion to do this unchosen action” could\nanalogously make blame appropriate. They thus dispute Sher’s\n(2009: 140) contention that conscious choice and failures of awareness\n(caused in the way he indicates) are equally good ways of satisfying\nthe origination relation and grounding\n blameworthiness.[14],\n [15] \nWe have surveyed the five main positions regarding the EC on moral\nresponsibility. Intuitively, being morally responsible for some action\nor event requires awareness of certain things. As we have seen,\nhowever, there is great controversy about how to characterize the kind\nand content of the requisite awareness and, more fundamentally, about\nwhether awareness is actually required at all or not. A natural\nquestion is: how can we adjudicate the dispute among the different\npositions? The structure of the discussion suggests focusing on two\ncriteria (Wieland 2017a: 26): i) what position fits best with our\nintuitions about responsibility in different cases; ii) what position\nmerges best with the right conception of responsibility. \nConcerning the first criterion, many philosophers take it as a given\nthat theorizing about moral responsibility must be constrained by our\nordinary judgments and intuitions. So if an account of the EC clashes\nwith those judgments and intuitions, that gives us a pro\ntanto reason to reject it and, conversely, being able to\naccommodate them is a point in its favor (Sher 2009: 17; Clarke 2014:\n162; Schnall 2004: 308; FitzPatrick 2008: 610; Peels 2011: 578;\nMontmarquet 1999: 845; Arpaly 2015: 155). Other philosophers reject\nthis “methodological conservatism” (Levy 2017) and take\nthe opposite line of giving priority to what they take to be the\ncorrect theory of responsibility, even if it implies that a good many\nof our ordinary judgments and intuitions are misguided (Rosen 2004:\n296; Zimmerman 2008: 205). In order to break the stalemate in the\ntheory vs. intuitions dispute, some have advanced an error theory of\nintuitions of blameworthiness in cases of unwitting wrongdoing which,\nif correct, would entail that failing to accommodate them\nshouldn’t be hold against an account of the EC (Levy 2017;\nTalbert 2017b); while others have offered empirical evidence to support the very same intuitions (Murray et al. forthcoming). Yet\nother philosophers have presented empirical evidence concerning ordinary intuitions\nof praise-/blameworthiness in cases of moral ignorance that appears to support\nthe quality-of-will theorists’ view that moral knowledge\nisn’t required for either (Faraci & Shoemaker 2014). Thus,\none way of settling the debate on the EC is to pursue this discussion\non the preeminence, reliability, and content of ordinary intuitions\nabout responsibility. \nConcerning the second criterion, it was noted at the end of\n section 3.3\n that the disagreement between quality-of-will theorists and the rest\nis partially grounded on competing conceptions of responsibility, and this suggests that settling the debate on the EC partly depends on\nhow this broader dispute is resolved. Some philosophers think that it\ncan be shown that one conception is the only correct one (Levy 2005;\nA. Smith 2012), but the consensus seems to be that the different\nconceptions are all valid, since each of them captures different\naspects of our responsibility practices (Watson 1996; Shoemaker 2011;\nZimmerman 2015). If the latter view is correct, it’s entirely\npossible that certain epistemic requirements apply to some types of\nresponsibility but not to others (Mason 2015; Zimmerman 2017) and,\nconsequently, it might well be the case that there are different EC\ndepending on the type of responsibility we focus on.","contact.mail":"ferudy@alumni.stanford.edu","contact.domain":"alumni.stanford.edu"}]
