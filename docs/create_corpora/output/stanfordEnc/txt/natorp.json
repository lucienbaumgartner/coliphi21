Born in Düsseldorf on\nJanuary 24, 1854, he began his university education at Bonn in\nclassical philology under Hermann Usener, and continued at the\nUniversity of Strassburg, but as he neared completion of his studies,\nhe found himself unsatisfied with his work, and vexed by “a\nsecret philosophical urge” (Natorp 1921f: 152–153; all\ntranslations by the author). It found its outlet when a friend\nstudying at Marburg wrote to him of Hermann Cohen and F.A. Lange, and\nof their interpretation of Kant; thenceforth Natorp “placed his\nwhole thinking and his entire, powerful capacity for work in the\nservice of this single task:” the development of\n“philosophy as science” (Cassirer 1925: 276). His first\nphilosophy teacher was Ernst Laas, whose anti-Kantian and\nanti-Platonic positivism incited Natorp to deeper engagement with the\nphilosophy of critique (Natorp 1921f: 153). In this way, his early\nphilosophical studies converged with his original love of philology as\nhe pursued the “prehistory” of Kantian critique in\nDescartes, Galileo, and Copernicus, back to Plato (Natorp 1921f: 154).\nNatorp completed his Habilitation under Cohen at Marburg in\n1881, and taught there until his death on August 17, 1924.\n\n\nDuring his long and prolific tenure at Marburg, Natorp came into\ncontact with a number of illustrious scholars and writers. Boris\nPasternak, Karl Barth, and Ernst Cassirer were among his students;\nRabindranath Tagore was his friend. In the fateful summer of 1914 the\nyoung T.S. Eliot caricatured Natorp, the director of the summer\nprogram in which he was enrolled\n [image available online].\n In addition to Cohen, academic colleagues included the philosopher\nNicolai Hartmann, the theologians Rudolf Bultmann and Rudolf Otto, and\nthe literary scholar Ernst Robert Curtius. Late in life, Natorp\ndirected Hans-Georg Gadamer’s doctoral dissertation (Gadamer\n1922), and, together with his long-time philosophical interlocutor,\nEdmund Husserl of Freiburg, engineered Martin Heidegger’s\nappointment as an Extraordinarius at Marburg in 1923. Upon\nNatorp’s death the following summer (see Heidegger 1992),\nHeidegger assumed his chair, thus bringing the department’s\nKantian orientation to a decisive close. \n\n\nLike his younger contemporary, Ernst Cassirer, Natorp initially\nfocused on the explication, defense, and elaboration of Cohen’s\ndifficult and often impenetrable work on Kant-interpretation, the\ntheory of science, and the history of\n philosophy.[1]\n While Natorp published important works of contemporary systematic\nphilosophy (1887, 1888h), he devoted much of his attention in the last\ndecades of the nineteenth century to filling out historical elements\nin Cohen’s larger framework. He especially employed his\nexpertise in Greek thought to work out ancient anticipations of\n“critical” scientific philosophy, and analyze its natural\ndevelopment. Later, in the chaotic social, political, and cultural\nlandscape of pre- and interwar Germany, and especially in the wake of\nCohen’s death in 1918, Natorp departed from the classic Marburg\nconcentration on the logic of the exact sciences. This departure was\nless a shift in his basic philosophical outlook than the sounding of\nnew themes, some native to the Marburg School, others arising out of\ndialogue with other philosophers. Motivated by the liberal-socialist\n ideals[2]\n integral to the global theory of culture that was the\nMarburgers’ ultimate\n aim,[3]\n Natorp wrote widely on ethics, politics, and\n Sozialpädagogik.[4]\n On the other hand, one must also interpret Natorp’s later\nthought (esp. his “ontological turn”; von Wolzogen, 1988; Brach 1996) in light of his\ndialogue with other philosophies challenging neo-Kantianism’s\ndominance in the German academy, notably the so-called\nLebensphilosophie, and the phenomenologies of Husserl and\n Heidegger.[5]\n\nNeo-Kantianism, it is often said, was the dominant current of late\nnineteenth-century German academic philosophy. While true, this\nstatement is uninformative, since the label conveys no clear doctrinal\ncontent. Given the widespread perception that philosophy had become\ndiscredited by the untenable claims of the German Idealists, the\nvarious neo-Kantian schools shared a conviction that Kant—on\nsome interpretation of his sobriety—could give philosophy a\nrespectable and genuine task again, now that it had awakened from its\nlong post-Hegelian hangover (cf. Natorp 1918a: 4–6; Dussort\n1963; Schnädelbach 1983a, 1983b; Köhnke 1986; Philonenko 1989; Sluga 1976: 28). The\nlabel therefore does not necessarily signify a revival of Kant’s\ndoctrines (much less of Kant-scholarship for its own\n sake[6]\n ), but rather, as Natorp himself puts it, philosophizing in the\nspirit of Kant (Natorp 1918a: 7). But what does that mean? For the\nMarburg School, Kant’s great idea, “the central notion\nwith respect to which one must relate, understand, and evaluate\neverything else in Kant” is the transcendental method\n(Natorp 1912c: 194; cf. Cassirer 1925: 288). This method constitutes\n“the unshakeable guideline of our whole philosophizing”\n(Natorp 1912c: 196). Why? Because the transcendental method anchors\nphilosophy in facts (eminently the fact of mathematical physics),\nof which philosophy is to establish the conditions of\npossibility or justification (Rechtsgrund) (Natorp 1912c:\n197; 196). By limiting itself to this task of justification,\nphilosophical reason keeps itself from ascending into the aether of\nspeculation. At the same time, by discovering the source of scientific\nobjectivity (and thus of rational objectivity generally), i.e., by\n“clearly exhibiting the law [of objectivity] in its\npurity”, philosophy “secures science [and rational\nactivity generally] in its autonomy and preserves it from alien\ndistraction” (Natorp 1912c: 197–198). Transcendental\nphilosophy in the Kantian spirit, then, is doubly\n“critical”, checking itself against metaphysical excesses,\non the one hand, but also rigorously formulating the ideal grounds of\nthe sciences, on the other (Natorp 1912c: 198; cf. Poma 1997, ch. 3,\n4). At the same time, the Marburg School finds in the critical\nphilosophy an idealistic bulwark against the empiricism epitomized by\nMill. \nMoreover, the Marburgers endorsed Kant’s view that philosophy\nshould adopt an approach to the other domains of human\nculture—morality, art, and religion—that was\n“critical” in just the transcendental sense described\nabove. This approach, then, takes the critique of science as the\nparadigm of philosophy’s relation to culture in general. Just as\nthe critical theory of science begins from the concrete theories\ndeveloped by the special sciences, so philosophy in general should\nbegin from the achievements of culture (e.g., works of art, moral\naction or institutions), and investigate the basis of their claims.\nThis is one reason Cohen and Natorp call their critical philosophy\n“idealism”, because its task vis-à-vis culture is\nto lay out the system of rational principles that make possible the\n“facts” of science, morality, and art. At the same time,\ntheir idealism aims at making explicit the “ideas” that\nguide, or ought to guide, the continuous development of culture.\nFinally, the Marburgers’ very theory of transcendental\nprinciples is itself “idealistic” in the radical sense\nthat all objects of experience are held to be the products solely of\nthe activity of thinking. Nevertheless, Marburg theory denies\nphilosophy any “speculative” task of seeing or knowing\nthings that are beyond experience, of constructing systems of ideas\nthat are not immanent in the facts of human knowledge, action, or\nproduction. Like Cassirer, Natorp makes this view of philosophy in the\nKantian spirit the basis of his own philosophy of science and of his\nhistorical interpretations. \nOne main reason why neo-Kantians of all stripes see the essence of\nphilosophy in critique is that it guarantees philosophy’s\nautonomy (cf. Natorp 1887: 266–269, 285, et passim). Of\nall rational activities, philosophy alone has the task of discovering\nthe conditions and regulative ideals that make such activities at all\npossible. While the problem of philosophy’s identity as a\ndiscipline of course goes back to Plato, we are faced, in the\nnineteenth-century German context, with the particular problem of\nphilosophy’s relation to the positive sciences, which had\ncompletely repudiated and replaced the knowledge-claims of the\nspeculative systems of German Idealism. For the Marburgers, the issue\nof philosophy’s disciplinary integrity becomes intertwined with\nthe question of the autonomy of reason itself. Cohen and Natorp faced\na difficult task. Having turned their backs on speculative philosophy,\nthey could not define reason’s autonomy by falling back upon the\ndiscredited Geist of German\n Idealism.[7]\n But they also could not let reason (or as they prefer to call it,\n“thinking”) be conceived as a set of psychological\noperations, since that would subject reason’s laws (logic) to\nmore basic psychological or psychophysical laws. Already in his\n(1887), Natorp objects to such psychologism (though he does not use\nthe term) on the grounds that science and knowledge, and the very\nnotion of objective truth these presuppose, would be rendered\nsenseless if grounded in the subjective experience of the\nthinking or knowing psyche (see esp.\n Section 4).\n The chief task for any account of Natorp’s philosophy, then, is\nto make sense of his notion of rational autonomy. \nBeyond the issue of reason’s autonomy or priority, another\ncentral issue for Natorp is reason’s history; again, this is a\nconcern typical of the Marburg School generally; one of its\npeculiarities is the quasi-Hegelian insistence upon the integration of\nthe systematic and historical moments of philosophy. Cohen wrote major\nessays on Plato (Cohen 1866, 1878), and Natorp’s early work\nconcentrated on what the Marburgers considered ancient and early\nmodern anticipations of the critical philosophy. Then there is\nNatorp’s magnum opus, Platos Ideenlehre of\n1903, in which he simultaneously develops a “critical”\ninterpretation of the theory of forms and an argument for the order of\nthe dialogues, all conceived as an “Introduction to\nIdealism” (cf. Laks 1994, 2003). \nDuring his life, Paul Natorp was overshadowed by his mentor, Cohen,\nand after his death, by the more glamorous Cassirer. For decades, if\nhe was mentioned at all, one remembered his controversial Plato book,\nor, perhaps, his other contributions to the study of Greek thought\n(cf., e.g., Stewart 1909; Owens 1978; Gaiser 1969). But Natorp has\nbeen further obscured by the general eclipse of neo-Kantianism for\nmost of the twentieth\n century.[8]\n It has only been since the late 1970’s, with the revival of\nEuropean interest in the Marburg School, and especially through the\nwork of Helmut Holzhey since the\n 1980’s,[9]\n that Natorp has reappeared on the philosophical scene and the unique\nfeatures of his thought have become more plainly distinguished from\n Cohen’s.[10]\n Holzhey’s unearthing of several heterodox, critical texts\n(Holzhey 1986: vol. 2) from the Nachlass suggests that Natorp\nhimself had suppressed them, either “for the sake of maintaining\nthe unity of the ‘Marburg School,’” or because he\ndid not always think himself able to provide an alternative to a\nparticular Cohenian\n thesis.[11]\n Yet, despite the Marburgers’ loud assertion of the centrality\nto their philosophy of science and its history, most recent interest\nin Cohen has focused on his late works in the philosophy of religion;\nand despite Natorp’s allegiance to Cohen’s generally\nscientistic program, much ado is made of his purported\n“ontological turn” (cf., e.g., Brach 1996: 190, ff.;\nStolzenberg 1995, ch. 5) away from epistemology. By contrast, this\narticle focuses on Natorp’s thought in the areas to which he\nafter all devoted most of his career as a member of the Marburg\nSchool: philosophy of science, history of philosophy, and\nphilosophical psychology; it does not deal with his politics or\npedagogical theories (see esp. Willey 1978; Jegelka 1992; Natorp\n1905), philosophically informed though they are (Cohen 1914: 470). \nIt is a commonplace of nineteenth-century German intellectual history\nthat with the collapse of post-Kantian Idealism, philosophy ceded its\nclaim of scientificity to the positive\n sciences.[12]\n The special sciences made rapid and startling progress, continually\nadding to the store of human knowledge. Philosophy, meanwhile, seemed\nto have lost its way, and many thinkers pinned their hopes for a\nrehabilitation of philosophy on a return to Kant. The Marburg School\nin particular interpreted this to mean that philosophy should orient\nitself with respect to the sciences, rather than strive—as\nGerman Idealism had—to forge a scientific system of its own,\nindependent from the results of the positive sciences: only in this\nattenuated sense would philosophy be “scientific”. For all\nthat, Natorp by no means conceived philosophy as a humble handmaiden.\nOn the contrary, its task is to discover and establish the highest\nprinciple(s) of rational understanding, and thereby the principles not\nonly of the sciences, but also of ethics and aesthetics, in short, of\nall the domains of human culture (cf. Cohen 1902: 443). It must\nhowever take science as its primary object of inquiry because science\nrepresents the paradigm of knowing (Erkenntnis). Only a\ncritique of science can therefore elucidate rationality or, as the\nMarburgers call it, the “logic” of thinking, for it is\nonly in science that we can most reliably witness thinking at work,\nsuccessfully achieving knowledge. Thus the question of the\n“concept of science” becomes “the chief question of\nlogic and the foundational question of philosophy” (Cohen 1902:\n445). The Marburgers identify the unifying principle of science and\nethics in\n particular[13]\n as the concept of law (Gesetz), and, as Cohen puts it,\n“it is the business of logic to determine the meaning of law, or\nrather, the meanings of law” (Cohen 1902: 445). \nNatorp and Cohen find general affirmation of this train of thought in\nKant’s project of seeking the conditions of possibility of the\n“fact” of mathematical natural science (cf. Kant\nProlegomena). However, the similarities end there, for by\nrejecting or modifying several basic aspects of Kant’s\nphilosophy, they also end up with a radically transformed conception\nof the nature of scientific experience and the meaning of knowledge.\nThe first of their modifications stems from an anti-psychologistic\ncritique of Kant himself, namely of what they see as a confusion in\nthe first Critique between the task of a transcendental\ngrounding of the sciences and that of a transcendental logic of human\ncognition (Stolzenberg 1995: 25. But compare Holzhey 1984: 137). The\nformer is in their view the genuine critical enterprise, for it\npromises to reveal the autonomous sources of objective knowledge,\nwhereas the latter threatens to trace science back to psychological,\nand therefore contingent, subjective (albeit a priori)\n wellsprings.[14]\n Second, they deny any scientific role to intuition as conceived by\nKant, either pure or empirical. Partly this is a result of their\nanti-psychologism, which forbids them from grounding the objectivity\nof science in the subjective faculties of cognition; but it is also\nbecause they see, with Kant, the essence of thinking in its activity\nand spontaneity, whereas intuition (at least as defined by Kant) is\npassive and receptive (cf., e.g., Kant, Kritik der reinen\nVernunft (KrV), A68/B93). Hence, intuition thus\nconceived threatens to introduce a heteronomous, and therefore\nrationally unacceptable, factor into science. Finally, the Marburgers\nfollow their German Idealist predecessors in dismissing all talk of\nthings in themselves, conceived as things existing independently of\nknowledge. We can see how these three important modifications of\nKant’s philosophy stem from the same basic concern with rational\nautonomy. For reason to be autonomous, its activity must be\nspontaneous; but this spontaneity cannot be conceived of\npsychologically, because human cognition as a matter of fact has a\npassive, and therefore heteronomous, intuitive element, namely\nsensibility. Furthermore, things in themselves can play no explanatory\nrole here because they are ex hypothesi alien to reason. \nThese modifications have two radical consequences for Kantian\ndoctrine, consequences that characterize the Marburgers’ own\ntheory of science and cognition. The first is a new conception of\nscience; the second is a new conception of the categories (see\n Section 4).\n It might seem that science, as the achievement of an autonomous\nrationality, must fail to be objectively true of the world, if\nreason’s autonomy implies that it can have no intuitive,\nreceptive link to the world via sensibility. How in general could the\nrationally constructed system be related to experience or constrained\nby it? How in particular could physics, the science of motion in space\nand time, be possible if the pure forms of intuition, space and time,\nwere banished from science (cf. Friedman 2000: 26, ff.)? \nIf Natorp often seems to embrace the troubling thesis that science is\nnot of the phenomenal world, this is because he holds, first, that the\nmeaning of “phenomenon” is problematic; and second, that\nthe aspect of science relevant to philosophy has nothing to\ndo with its relation to a phenomenal realm. In this he follows\nCohen’s dictum: \nNot the stars in the heavens are the objects which [the\ntranscendental] method teaches us to contemplate in order to know\nthem; rather, it is the astronomical calculations, those facts of\nscientific reality which are the “actuality” that needs to\nbe explained…. What is the foundation of the reality which is\ngiven in such facts? What are the conditions of that certainty from\nwhich visible actuality takes its reality? The laws are the facts, and\n[hence] the objects [of our investigation]; not the star-things.\n(Cohen 1877: 27,\n f.)[15] \nThe point is that the scientific or epistemic value of, say,\nastronomy, is not to be found in what is given and observable by the\nsenses, but rather in the mathematical exactness of its equations.\nThese alone constitute and underwrite the truth-value of\nastronomy’s propositions, and they are solely the achievements\nof reason’s activity. As noted above, the essential\ncharacteristic of science lies in its objectivity, and that\nobjectivity is rooted in its lawfulness. It is this formal feature of\nobjectivity that constitutes the philosophical interest in science,\nnot the material content of a particular science’s theorems; in\nother words, the philosophical question is: “How is this\nlawfulness possible?” This question is distinct from the\npsychological question, “What are the psychological laws that\nmake it possible for me (as a psychophysical being) to observe a\nstar?” or the astronomical question, “What are the laws\ngoverning the ’being’ of this star in its states and\nproperties?” \nHence, it is not so much the case that science on the\nMarburgers’ conception loses all traction on the phenomenal or\n“actual” world, as that they are asking an entirely\ndifferent question. While for Kant himself such traction is the only\nwarrant that we are cognizing a genuine object, for Natorp the nexus\nof science and apparent reality is irrelevant to the spontaneous,\nlegislating factor of science that is the activity of reason alone and\ntherefore of paramount interest to philosophy. How such essentially\nsubjective application of categories to sensible phenomena in fact\nhappens is a problem of psychology, not philosophy, to investigate.\nThus we must be very careful in interpreting the Marburg talk of\n“scientific experience”: it is not experience in general\nor psychological (subjective) experience (Erlebnis), but\nscientific (objective) experience (Erfahrung) which is the\n“fact” whose transcendental sources philosophy is to seek\n(cf. Natorp 1910c: 13). Yet we must not in turn take this\nscientific “experience” to mean “experience cleansed\nby experiment” (to paraphrase\n Helmholtz[16]\n ): experiment by definition obviously remains empirical. Rather, by\n“scientific experience” Natorp just means the\n“legislative” act of categorial “Grundlegung”,\nof\n “hypothesis”.[17] \nBy the end of the nineteenth century, it was obvious to any informed\nobserver of science that its categorial structures were in fact\nhypothetical and dynamic: the fact of scientific experience could no\nlonger be taken as the essentially complete edifice of Newtonian\nphysics, as Kant had done. In Natorp’s rewording of Kant,\nscience is not a factum at all, but a fieri, i.e.,\nnot an accomplished deed, but an ongoing doing (cf. Natorp 1910c: 14).\nHence, what makes science scientific—i.e., productive of genuine\nknowledge—cannot possibly be founded on a set of fixed\n(physical) principles, analogous to mathematical axioms, the certainty\nof which permanently grounds its theorems. Instead, the Marburgers\nargue, the essence of science can only reside in its method,\ni.e., in the regular and regulated manner of its progress. And since\nthis scientificity is equivalent to objectivity or lawfulness,\ntranscendental critique must determine the relation of lawfulness to\nmethod. \nIn his memoirs, Hans-Georg Gadamer calls Natorp, his doctoral\nsupervisor, a “Methodenfanatiker” (Gadamer 1977:\n62). By this Gadamer means that Natorp, for most of his career,\nfocused on the methodical aspect of thinking to the point of reducing\nthinking to method. To understand this riddling statement, one must\ntake into account Natorp’s interpretation of the word,\n“method”. He writes: \nThe directedness towards a goal which Natorp claims is implied by\n“method” illuminates one of two\n senses[19]\n in which his philosophy is idealistic, namely that science (and the\nother activities of culture) are guided by regulative ideas or\nlimit-concepts (Grenzbegriffe). Ideas, as Kant argues in the\nTranscendental Dialectic, are a priori concepts whose source\nlies in pure reason alone. Their only legitimate—though\nindispensable—theoretical use is to regulate the\nunderstanding’s cognition of objects: reason sets down the\nconditions under which the understanding’s activity will have\nachieved its ideal completion in the systematic interconnection of its\ncognitions, i.e., in an ultimate science. Reason thereby offers the\nunderstanding a rule—viz. maximal scope and maximal internal\nsystematicity—against which any actually achieved system of\nscience must be measured; and because human finitude makes it\nimpossible in principle for any actual system to attain the ideal\nmaximum, reason also spurs the understanding on towards ever new\ndiscoveries and\n reorganizations.[20] \nWhile Natorp often seems to blur the distinction between Kantian\ncategories and ideas, collapsing them both into\n“hypotheses” (see below), there is one notion that does\nfunction as an ideal: the Ding an sich. According to Natorp,\nthe thing in itself, properly conceived, is a “pure\nlimit-concept [Grenzbegriff], which merely delimits\n[begrenzt] experience in its own creative legislation”\n(Natorp 1912c: 199); more precisely, the thing in itself is not some\nmind-independent X, but rather an X necessarily\nimplied by the fact of scientific progress, namely the\n“comprehensive sum total [Inbegriff] of scientific\nknowledge” (Natorp 1918a: 19). Because science is an activity of\nreason alone, and the thing in itself is a rational posit necessary\nfor that activity, it is no longer in conflict with the postulate of\nreason’s autonomy. Given an object of scientific cognition, the\ncognition is conceived as a process never “definitively\nconcluded”, as Cohen says; rather, “every true concept is\na new question; none is a final answer” (Cohen 1885, cited at\nNatorp 1918a: 19). Natorp comments: “Just this is the meaning of\nthe thing in itself as X: the infinite task” (Natorp\n1918a: 19). In other words, the thing in itself is the ideal of an\nobject exhaustively determined by concepts, that is, completely known.\nAs with Kant, however, our cognitive finitude means that the process\nof conceptual determination can only approach this ideal\n asymptotically.[21]\n This pursuit of total determination is what Natorp calls\n“method”, the pursuit of science. \nThis brings us to the key notion of “hypothesis”. The\npursuit of science—its “method” in Natorp’s\nspecial sense—proceeds by hypothesis. Sometimes he puts it more\npointedly: hypothesis is method. Since method is for him a\n“going-after” or pursuit of the “perpetually distant\ngoal” (Natorp 1910c: 97) or focus imaginarius of\ncomplete objective determination, Natorp interprets\n“hypothesis” in a correspondingly active sense. He takes\nthe term “hypo-thesis” quite literally as a\n“setting-down” or “laying-under”, or as he\nputs it, a “Ge-setz” or\n“Grund-legung” (cf. Cohen 1902: 449; 1916: 308,\nff.). These glosses all emphasize the activity of hypothesis: it is\nless a posit than a positing, an act by which thinking proceeds and\nbecomes experience. Natorp writes:  \nThe act of hypothesis has two\n aspects.[22]\n First, hypothesis as law (Gesetz) or groundwork\n(Grundlegung) is the transcendental foundation for scientific\nexperience, i.e., for the activity of legislating and thus rationally\nunderstanding the phenomena. The “phenomena” in question\nare not however the sensible phenomena of subjective, psychic\nexperience (Erlebnis), but are instead themselves already\nconstructions or interpretations. These constructions in turn are\nfounded on hypotheses of a lower order, viz. on specific concepts\nformulated to transmute particular subjective experiences into\nobjective knowledge. To take up our earlier example, when the\nastronomer speaks of planets and their laws of motion, he is speaking\nobjectively of scientific phenomena, as opposed to\nthe subjective appearance of sensible phenomena to\nyou or me. Therefore, on Natorp’s view, strange as it may sound,\nthe phenomenon “Mars” is an hypothesis, an object\ncertainly, but for all that an ideal and never fully determined\nthought-object; moreover, the motion of this object, too, is\nideal: it can be calculated with the utmost exactitude. It is these\ntwo hypotheses—the concept, “Mars”, and the laws\ngoverning its motion—that alone are objective, and susceptible\nto knowledge; the reddish speck in the sky is merely a subjective\nappearance, of which there can be no genuine (astronomical)\nscience. \nTo pull our strands together, thinking in the strict sense is\nscientific thinking, for it alone is generative of knowledge, i.e.,\nobjective truth. Science (and therefore knowledge) as a matter of fact\nevolves through time: science is a fieri. However, this\nevolution or fieri is not unregulated, but moves in a\ncontinuous pursuit of ever more precise determinations of experience:\nthis pursuit is literally called “method”. These\ndeterminations of experience just are the objects of science. The\nphilosophical task therefore is to analyze the condition of\npossibility of the regularity of this methodical\ndetermination of experience. Natorp (like Cohen; 1902: 449) identifies\nthis condition as hypothesis, interpreted as law (Ge-setz,\nposit); experience in the strict sense is only possible given a law\n(Gesetz) that functions as its interpretational groundwork or\nfoundation (Grundlegung). The first hypothesis or primal\nposit then must be the law of lawfulness, viz., the rational postulate\nthat experience, in order to be Erfahrung, and not mere\nErlebnis, must accord with law, i.e., be grounded on a\nrational foundation (cf. Natorp 1887: 285; 1911e; 1917: 246). This\ncategorical imperative, that all its experience fall under law, is the\noriginary act of reason wherein lies its ultimate autonomy; it is the\nregulative principle of the continuous, orderly flow of\n experience.[23]\n As a general, purely formal law it regulates the particular\nhypotheses, which in turn generate or ground particular objects of\nErfahrung (such as “Mars”,\n“electricity”, “atom”, or\n“gravity”) in the regulated process of their ever wider\nand ever more rigorous determination. How it does this is a\nseparate problem, one that Natorp attempts to solve through his system\nof categories, treated in the next section. \nJust as “experience” for the neo-Kantians is restricted to\n“scientific experience”, so too is “thinking”\nrestricted to “scientific thinking;” in fact, Natorp\nvirtually conflates experience and thinking. His view of science as\nthe progress (Gang) of method via hypotheses regulated by an\nideal of complete objective determination leaves the problem of what\nexactly these hypotheses do and how they do it: the problem of Marburg\n“logic”. As Cassirer points out, Natorp’s conception\nof logic presses the traditional “analytic” doctrines of\nconcept, judgement, and syllogistic into the background in favor of\nthe “synthetic” logic of the genesis of mathematical and\nphysical\n objectivity.[24]\n Natorp’s logic is therefore called “genetic;” it\ntells how thinking lawfully generates or synthesizes the unities that\nare its objects of knowledge. As such however it amounts to an\nanalytic reconstruction of thinking’s synthetic construction of\nits objects (Natorp 1887: 283). He writes: \nIn other words, the scientific hypotheses or laws (Ge-setze)\nby which science methodically, synthetically progresses are not\ntransparent to rationality qua scientific; instead, they must\nbe analogically retraced by a critical “logic”. \nFor Natorp, as for Kant, thinking is activity, doing: the technical\nterm is “function”. This word, however, is as ambiguous as\nit is central to the Marburg account of\n thinking.[25]\n Occasionally, “function” seems to mean something like\nsubjective, psychic act, and as such is excluded from epistemological\nconsideration (Natorp 1887: 266); usually, however, it signifies the\nspontaneity of thinking, not in psychological terms, but as the\nrational act of hypothetical legislation discussed earlier. In this\nsecond signification it is sometimes connected with\n“function” in the mathematical sense, or else mathematical\nfunctions are adduced as paradigmatic of the functional conception of\n thinking.[26]\n The standard sense of “function” for Natorp, then, is\nthat of an act or “operation” of thinking, where this\nmeans laying down a hypothesis. Since the hypothesis is always a\nconcept, a generality that imposes a unity upon a phenomenal manifold,\nwe can understand “function” more precisely as the act of\nunification or synthesis.  \nFor Kant, too, the term, “function”, is always connected\nto the categories’ spontaneity and their synthetic activity;\nfurther, he holds that true cognition (Erkenntnis)\ncan only occur if the synthesis in question “schematizes”\nrepresentations given in intuition (cf. Young 1992; Friedman 1992,\n2000). By contrast, Natorp understands all concepts as\nfunctional, i.e., as categorial, since all of them, including the\nconcepts of space and time, are thought-operations serving to unify a\n manifold.[27]\n As we saw above, Natorp rejects any notion of intuition as a passive\nfaculty receptive of a given sensible manifold (cf. Natorp 1912c:\n201). Instead, he interprets intuition as itself an act of synthesis,\ni.e., as a generation of unity. He argues that a critical account of\nknowledge is not justified in presupposing some object conceived as\nexisting radically independent of mind, and which then somehow affects\nit via intuition: to do so would be tantamount to an intolerable\n“metaphysicism” (Natorp 1912c: 202). Rather, Natorp claims\nto find in the first Critique itself the basis for his view\nthat intuition is not a factor “alien to thought\n[denkfremd]”, but that it merely signifies a different\naspect of thinking, viz. that aspect in which a fully\nspatio-temporally determined object, rather than merely a law, is\nthought (Natorp 1912c: 204; Natorp 1910c: 2–3). This\n“fulfillment [Vollzug]” of objective thought  \nin each of its stages requires rigorously unambiguous determination,\nbut determination always with respect to the lawful functions of\nthinking itself: determination of the particular, of quantity, of\nquality, in accord with the relation of causality and its laws.\n(Natorp 1912c: 204; Natorp 1887: 280)  \nOn this view, far from being separate from and opposed to thinking as\nthey seem to be in the first Critique, space and time, as the\nforms of intuition, are originary thought-acts that make possible the\ndetermination of any object whatsoever. They are hypothesized,\nsynthetic manifolds, or—more precisely—unified, ordered\nmanifolds of points or “positions” (Stellen) into\nwhich any object must first be integrated if it is to undergo any\nfurther determination as to quantity, quality, etc. (Natorp 1912c:\n203; 1887: 280. Cf. esp. 1911e: 76–77; PI, 159, ff;\n366, ff.). Thus, only in virtue of these various synthetic procedures\nof progressive determination, which Natorp calls\n“objectivation” (i.e., object-formation), can a phenomenon\neven appear. But how does it appear? Since intuition and thinking are\nbeing analyzed here entirely at the “functional” level,\nthe phenomenon evidently does not appear as a sensible\nobject, i.e., one that may be assigned a unique set of spatio-temporal\nloci, and that then may serve as a carrier (Träger) of\nall further determinations of quality, quantity, or relation. \nThis then raises the following pressing question: if, as he argues,\nintuition is itself a synthetic activity, what “matter”\ndoes it synthesize, if not the sensible manifold? Natorp is\ndistressingly elusive on this point, even in his explicit discussions\nof the status of time and space in science (cf. Natorp 1910c: Chapter\n7). The following is clear, however. Like Kant, Natorp understands\nthinking always to be thinking an object. For Natorp, however, this\nmeans “constituting”, “constructing”, or\n“objectivating” the object. But since he (re)interprets\nthese objects as non-sensible phenomena, he also interprets space and\ntime non-psychologically, i.e., as non-sensible. They are not the\nforms of sensible intuition, but the ideal system of dimensions (three\nspatial dimensions plus time (cf. Natorp 1910c: 303, ff.;\n397–398), conceived as  \nstructures of a purely mathematical kind, which nonetheless go beyond\nmere number, in virtue of the general relation to existence [that is]\ncontained in their very concepts. (Natorp 1910c:\n 341)[28] \nThus a very crucial distinction must be made between two levels of\nphenomenality and of objectivity, which for the purposes of this\narticle shall be called “first-order” and\n“second-order” (cf. Stolzenberg 1995: 25). A first-order\nphenomenon is the psychic, subjective appearance that Natorp\ntacitly acknowledge has a basis in sensibility, and which he calls the\n“Phänomen letzter Instanz” or the\n“phenomenon of final authority” (Natorp 1887: 273, 274;\n1913b:\n 192);[29]\n this first-order phenomenon is a “Vorstellung”,\nor “representation”, i.e., a doxic phenomenon (Natorp\n1887: 266, 267; esp. 273). Hence it cannot be the referent of\nknowledge or science, since science does not concern itself with doxic\nappearances as such, but the objects (or\nobjectivities) which appear in or through the appearances (Natorp\n1913b: 193).  \nBut how are we to understand this “appearing” of an object\n“through” the doxic appearances? What, precisely, is the\nrelation between the first-order and second-order\n“phenomena”? In the places where he explicitly mentions\nsensibility in the concrete, psychological sense (Natorp 1913b: 193),\nNatorp conceives it as never conveying or “giving” the\nmind an object, ready-made. Rather, “what” sensibility\ngives is so entirely indeterminate and uncoordinated that it cannot\neven be called a manifold; whatever the chaos of sensibility may be,\nNatorp conceives it as nothing more than a task\n(Aufgabe), problem, or demand\n(Forderung) for objectivity, that is,\n objectivation.[30]\n Since no thing (no object) is ever given in sensibility, any object\nis only ever constructed, and can only be known qua\nconstruction, viz. as an instance of its constituting law.  \nNatorp likens this problematic relation of first-order phenomenality\nand second-order objectivity to solving for X in an equation\n(Natorp 1887: 258, 262). If the solution(-set) of X is the\nobject for which thinking is to solve, then the sensible appearance is\nanalogous to the notational cipher, “X”, itself,\nsince what-has-not-yet-been-experienced is simply\nwhat-has-not-yet-been-constructed. Moreover, just as in solving an\nequation one can only determine the X in light of other known\nquantities assumed in the equation, one must in the same way establish\nthe determinations of the problematic object in light of other\nobjectivities (laws) that are assumed (ge-setzt). No such\nobjectivities are ever granted absolutely, of course, but only\nrelatively, namely with respect to the particular problem. They, too,\nare always susceptible to becoming problems in their turn. Therefore\nno complete solution—no total determination of the\nobject—can be achieved for any X, except\nasymptotically. While the fully determinate object itself thus remains\na forever unreachable focus imaginarius (see\n Section 3),\n it is, by the same token, always at least partially determined. And\nit is this partially determined objectivity as itself a\n(non-sensible) object of thinking that Natorp considers the\nsecond-order phenomenon, even though he will usually just call it a\n“phenomenon”, simpliciter. This\nscientific phenomenon, as an objectivity that is\nprogressively constituted by a dialectic between hypothesis and\ncalculation, entirely loses any sense of “appearance”.\nThis reconception of the phenomenon of mathematical physics finds an\nanalogue in geometry’s replacement of constructions “in\nintuition” by purely logical deductions from Grundlagen\n(or “functions” in the sense of “hypothetical\nact”) as epitomized by Hilbert’s Grundlagen der\nGeometrie (cf. Friedman 1992, Chapter 1; Hilbert 1999), a book\ncited with approval by Natorp (1910c: 4) and Cassirer (2000: 99, f.).\n \nThe question now is: what makes the second-order phenomenon a bona\nfide objectivity, in contrast to the first-order phenomenon? Whereas\nthe first-order phenomena constitute private, lived subjectivity, not\nopen to prediction or even adequate description, Natorp’s answer\nis that the second-order object is constructed in accordance with laws\nof thinking, which as laws are in their very nature objective, i.e.,\nuniversally valid for any thinker. Therefore objects\n(Gegenstände) lawfully determined will in principle be\nrationally transparent to any other thinker, i.e.,\n“objective” (objektiv,\ngegenständlich). Any such lawful objectivation or\nobject-formation just is knowledge or science, in the sense of being\nobjectively thinkable. These laws of constitution are in turn\nhierarchically arranged: the highest, most general laws are those\ngoverning all possible thinking, and thus the generation of all\nexperience. These are followed by mathematics, and by all the\nmathematically “exact” sciences. As was shown in\n Section 3,\n Natorp conceives these laws (Ge-setze) as\nessentially “hypothetical”, that is, as\ncategorial posits. With the apparent exception of the basic logical\nlaws (e.g., the indispensable “law of laws”), all\nsuch laws are in principle revisable (which is chiefly why the\ndetermination of objectivities must be conceived as asymptotic)\n(Natorp 1887: 274; 276–277). \nHence, philosophy, as transcendental critique (see\n Section 1),\n is “sharply distinguished from any kind of\n‘psychologism’” and “maintains its rigorously\nobjective character” (Natorp 1912c:\n 198).[31]\n Why? Because its point of departure is the objective\n“formations” [Gestaltungen] of human culture,\nas objectivities, not as products of subjective psychological\noperations (Natorp 1912c: 198). In other words, philosophy always\nbegins from the second-order phenomena. \nAlthough on Natorp’s view, the first-order phenomena of\nsubjective psychological experience (Erlebnis) elude\nscientific understanding altogether, he wrote two significant works on\nwhat he calls “critical” psychology. Pure,\nunconceptualized subjectivity is the immediate condition of the\npsyche; but the “logos” of science just means\n“objectivity”. Hence, Natorp argues, there can be no\n“psycho-logy” in the strict sense of the term, for it\nwould amount to the objectivation of subjectivity, and hence to the\nannihilation of the very thing a psychology would want to study: the\npsyche in its “natural” state (cf. Natorp, 1887: 283).\nAlthough there is no  \nimmediate access to the immediacy of psychic experience, [yet] it can\n… be approached by a [methodical] regression from its\nobjectivations, which must therefore [first] be secured in their own\npurely objective justification. (Natorp 1912c: 198)  \nThis is “critical” psychology in a nutshell. What Natorp\nmeans is this: there can be no objective “access”\nto immediate psychic experience, which is absolute subjectivity.\nNonetheless, we can gain access to a mediated subjectivity,\nnamely through the objects that have already been objectivated in\n(scientific) thinking. \nThinking, as we saw in\n Section 4,\n moves forward in a “synthetic” fashion from the less to\nthe more determinate. That is, in taking up a second-order phenomenon,\nthinking works on an object that retains, qua appearance\n(phenomenon), an as yet undetermined subjective, doxastic residue. It\nbrings (some of) this residue under laws, thus determining the object\nfurther: it is now better known and scientifically understood. Now,\ninstead of seeking the constitutive legislative framework that\ntranscendentally “grounded” that determination (the task\nof critical philosophy), critical psychology performs a\n“methodical regression”, viz., by undoing the\nobject’s most recent determinations, thus revealing its prior,\nrelatively more “subjective” phase. \nIn this way, Natorp thinks, antecedent stages of our latter-day\nscience can be reconstructed and temporarily resuscitated. This\nproject complements critical philosophy’s logical project, by\nallowing reconstruction of successive phases of objectivity, thus\nmaking our current knowledge more transparent to reflective\n reason.[32] \nWe finally turn to the Marburg thesis that philosophy, as philosophy\nof science, must also be the philosophical history of science. For\nscience, as a fieri (a doing) evolves over time;\nhence the activity of its basic functions and the regulated mutation\nof its laws can only be observed through time. Yet this historical\ntracing of the progress of science must be philosophically informed,\nthat is, grounded in the transcendentally isolated system of basic\nfunctions. As mentioned above, Natorp holds that the entire value of\nthe transcendental method is normative: having laid bare the\ncategorial functions in their purity, science can be judged as to its\nrigor, i.e., its submission to rational legislation. The Marburgers,\nwith this criterion in hand, enthusiastically apply it in praise and\nblame. \nA historiographical commonplace of neo-Kantianism has it that the\nlabor of grounding the sciences was divided between the Marburg and\nSouthwest Schools, the former attending to the natural sciences, the\nlatter to the human sciences or Geisteswissenschaften (cf.\nOesterreich 1923: 417). Recent scholarship has complicated this\npicture, reminding us of Rickert’s contributions to philosophy\nof natural science (cf., e.g., Rickert 1902; 1899), and noting that\nthe Marburg School, too, has a theory of history (esp. Edel 1994; Laks\n1994; Lembeck 1994). Already Cohen argues that the disciplinary\ndivision between systematic philosophy and the history of philosophy\nis artificial and harmful; he insists that “the study of\nphilosophy requires the connection of the systematic and historical\ninterest” (Cohen 1902: 440). \nStill, the common view, if one-sided, is not wrong, for the Marburg\ntheory of history has a very different starting-point than does the\nSouthwest School. Unlike Rickert and Windelband, Cohen and Natorp do\nnot begin their theory of history from the “fact” of\nhistorical science, in the way they begin their theory of natural\nscience from the “fact” of mathematical physics. When they\nspeak of history, they mean, on the one hand, the history of\nscience, and on the other, the history of philosophy,\nproperly construed, namely as the critique of science. Only\nsecondarily are they interested in political, economic, or social\nhistory, and only insofar as it advances their primary\n project.[33] \nThe Marburg conception of genuine philosophy as in the first\nplace a transcendental logic of natural science (cf. Cohen 1902:\n445) therefore restricts history to a history of “scientific\n idealism”.[34]\n In rejecting the view that scientific progress is better understood\nexclusively from a “systematic” perspective,\n“detache[d] … from its historical bonds”, (Cohen\n1902: 439) Cohen remarks that the “very value and security of\nscience is rooted in its own history, connected, as it were, with the\ngeneral history of mind [Geist]” (Cohen 1916: 310).\nThis sounds odd since we have heard again and again that science is\nrooted in its method, but now are told it is rooted in its\nhistory. Perhaps the paradox is only seeming, for there is an intimate\nconnection between the Marburg School’s notion of hypothesis as\nthe active posit of mind, on the one hand, and its notion of science\nas essentially historical, on the other. Their conception of the logic\nof science as the dynamic Gang of categorial hypotheses\nimplies that science can only be grasped developmentally, i.e.,\nhistorically. \nThe Marburg view of that history differs in two important respects\nfrom Hegel’s, with which it might otherwise seem to have much in\ncommon: first, it is not based upon a sequence of conceptual\ncontradiction and resolution; second, the history of science’s\ndevelopment is relativistic, that is, in principle incapable of\nachieving an “absolute” resolution (Natorp 1912c: 211,\nff.). Let me focus on the first of these differences. For Hegel,\nhistory is the linear evolution of Geist’s\nself-knowledge through time; the further to the right you go, the more\nadvanced the stage of (self-)consciousness. These stages—the\n“phenomena”—of Geist are inseparable from,\nindeed just are their cultural manifestations. Cohen and Natorp, too,\ntake genuine history to be the history of rational self-consciousness,\nbut for them this simply means reason’s transcendental,\nreflective consciousness of the basis of science, that is, method.\nThis principle of lawfulness is in itself unchanging, eternal,\natemporal; it is not expressed “in” phenomena, but instead\nmakes possible and generates phenomena as such; and indeed (as we saw\nabove) generates time itself as a condition of the possibilty of\nphenomena. Because its object—this rational insight into\nreason’s own principle—is essentially detached from time,\nhistory for the Marburg School is not conceived with respect to time.\nOf course science develops in time, and may be tracked diachronically\nalong a time-line, yet its innermost core is the self-same atemporal\nidea, around which science circles, its progression\nrepresented by ever wider, but concentric\n orbits.[35]\n Thus the history of science is itself ideal, in the sense of\nfocusing solely upon those moments of reflective illumination when\nscience becomes self-conscious—through philosophy—of its\nrational foundation or transcendental nucleus. Cohen writes: “In\nthe history of every science the history of scientific reason in\ngeneral always fulfills itself concentrically” (Cohen 1916:\n310). He considers the fact that each of these moments of\nself-consciousness must occur in concrete circumstances and have a\nunique point on a real time-line to be as obvious as it is\n irrelevant.[36] \nThe transcendental nucleus is method, and method is the meaning of\nidealism; hence, idealism is born when reason becomes self-conscious\nof its thinking as methodical and\n scientific.[37]\n Since this birth has a historical locus, Cohen argues,\n“idealism’s historical origin … conditions idealism\nthrough its connection with the methodological foundation of science\nno less than its material origin in methodology” (Cohen 1916:\n 309).[38]\n Put another way, idealism connects with its methodological foundation\nby connecting with its historical origin (cf. Cohen 1902:\n450). It follows that idealism has two related historical tasks: the\nprimary task is to open and maintain a direct avenue to its origin.\nThis involves the secondary task of retracing previous scientific\nconnections to that same primal idealism, which alone can serve as the\ncriterion of the “relatedness [Verwandtheit] of\ndifferent phases of science” (cf. Cohen 1916: 310). The history\nof idealism is therefore not of its evolution (as is the history of\nscience) but of its rebirths. \nThe history of science is a history of often contradictory or\nincommensurable theories, each of which is represented in\nCohen’s image as a ring. Nonetheless, as scientific, the variety\nof theories all express the same central, unitary activity of reason:\npositing hypotheses. Because of this constant unity of scientific\nreason, a “continuous connection of reason and the fundamental\nforces [Grundkräfte] of its history is required”\n(Cohen 1916: 310). By “fundamental forces” Cohen just\nmeans Greek\n antiquity,[39]\n specifically Plato: \nHistory’s “illuminating turning-points”, where\nidealism’s meaning manifests itself clearly and distinctly, are\nthe moments when the generative principle of scientific knowledge\nshines forth—i.e., when a critical, reflective perspective upon\nmethod is achieved—drawing the mind from its hyperbolic forays\nback into the regular orbit of reason, when we realize that we cannot\nsimply be guided by the things as they appear to us. They are moments\nof reason’s recollection, rebirth, and self-renewal (Cohen 1916:\n309). \nHence the Marburgers consider it of the utmost significance that their\nheroes—especially Galileo, Leibniz, and Kant—explicitly\nlink their conceptions of science back to Plato. As Cohen and Natorp\nselect and interpret their idealistic predecessors, they see\nillustrated in them the crucial immanent role of historical\nreflection in science, by which it ascends to transcendental\nself-reflection upon its methodological foundation (cf. Cohen 1902:\n450). As Cohen puts it, “history is … a sign\n[Wahrzeichen] of the inner life and growth of all problems of\nscientific reason as they emerge out of the root of their\nmethodology” (Cohen 1916: 310); and that root is, historically,\nPlato: “Idealism is the Idealism of the Platonic Idea”\n(Cohen 1916:\n 305).[40]\n For Cohen and Natorp, “Plato” signifies the organizing\nprinciple of science as a historically unfolding, living enterprise.\nTo stop reading Plato is to subtract science from its rational core,\nand deprive it—not of its method, which it will always have\nqua science—but of self-transparency of its own\npure foundation and legitimacy. \nAlthough history, according to Cohen, “discloses the origin of\nidealism from the start”, we must rely no less upon our methodic\nunderstanding of idealism in order “to recognize this idealism\ncorrectly wherever it appears” (Cohen 1916: 305). This statement\nconfirms the hermeneutic inseparability of system and history: each\nsupports the other. By “systematically” determining\nidealism as the method of science, we enable idealism to recognize\nitself in its historical manifestations; these manifestations, in\nturn, furnish the “fact” of science to be systematically\ndetermined. This reciprocity of history and theory informs the\nfollowing passage, in which Cohen links Plato with the Marburg\nprogram. \nIn other words, to succeed in the methodic or “logical”\ndetermination of idealism, we can do no better than ask the historical\nquestion of how Plato “hits upon this determination”. \nThis is precisely the task Natorp sets himself in Platos\nIdeenlehre [Plato’s Doctrine of Ideas]. True to\nthe Marburg view that idealism can only be understood by retracing its\ndevelopment, Natorp simultaneously reconstructs the idealistic meaning\nof the dialogues and the “logical” order in which they\nmust have been\n composed.[41]\n He takes a double-pronged approach by arguing, on the one hand, that\nthe Platonic ideai (forms or ideas) are in fact correctly\nunderstood to have a “critical” sense; and, on the other\nhand, by explaining why this critical intent of Plato (and by\nextension of all other critical idealists) was misconstrued not only\nby Aristotle and virtually the whole tradition, but even, at times, by\nPlato himself. That mistaken reading consists in taking the ideas to\nbe substances, i.e., really existent things, which however have a\npurely noetic, or rather, noumenal character; whose appearances (the\n“particulars”) may be sensible, but which in themselves\nexist “separately”, open only to a quasi-mystical vision.\nKant himself of course understood Plato in just this way, chastising\nhim for flying beyond the limits of reason on the wings of\nintellectual intuition.  \nNatorp by contrast argues—over the course of 500\npages—that while Plato may for various reasons talk in a way\nthat encourages such a reading, his most mature, sober, and\nself-critical dialogues support a categorial interpretation\nof the forms as “hypotheses” in the special sense\ndiscussed in\n Section 3.\n Thus, the problems of how the ideas could exist apart from the world\nof real particulars, and whether pure reason has a special intuitive\nfaculty capable of bridging the gulf, evaporate, once we recognize the\nimmanent operation of the ideai as the categorial\n hypotheses[42]\n that are the conditions of possibility of thinking in general, and of\nscience in particular. Thus Natorp interprets the supreme form, the\nform of the Good, as the “law of lawfulness”, (see\n Section 3)\n i.e., the unifying source of both theoretical and practical reason,\nwhile the five “great kinds” of the Sophist are\nseen as mutually implicative logical Grundbegriffe or\n“root-categories” of all predicative thinking. These\nideai are no more separately existent, according to Natorp,\nthan are Kant’s categories: they are not transcendent so much as\nthey are transcendental. It has been the incapacity of all\n(Aristotelian) realists or “dogmatists” to grasp this\ndistinction that has led to the chronic misunderstandings of Plato and\nall other “criticists”.  \nThe Marburg “theory” of history to which Natorp\nsubscribes, and in light of which he writes Platos\nIdeenlehre, is this: Plato’s moment of insight into the\ntruth of transcendental idealism (à la Cohen), is followed by\nmillenia of dark irrelevance, punctuated by shining rings of\nrecollection, epitomized by Galileo, Newton, and Kant. This picture of\nMarburg Philosophiegeschichtsphilosophie (cf. Lembeck 1994:\n1–2) will strike many as surreal; still, it only seems right to\nnote the following. Though we must understand the Marburg conception\nof history to grasp their motivation for reading and re-reading Plato,\nwe need not accept that conception in order to appreciate either\nNatorp’s genetic logic of science or his reading of Plato. As\nLembeck puts it in the introduction to his Platon in\nMarburg: \nFortunately for them, we can betray their idée fixe of\nPlato as the living heart of transcendental idealism without, as they\nwould think, destroying or dismissing their work. Indeed, one can\nperhaps better appreciate the value of Natorp’s reading of Plato\nif one does not think of it as support for Marburg idealism\nas such, but simply as an ingenious attempt to make sense of the\nrelation of ideal form and empirical particular, an attempt that\nmerely employs the logic of categorial functions as a hypothetical\nspringboard.
