His work in ancient philosophy, especially his various commentaries on Aristotle, is still considered to be of the highest caliber. Many believe\nthat Ross's work in this area is his most valuable\ncontribution to philosophy. However, his main writings in moral\nphilosophy are of lasting if not equal value. His The Right and the Good is\narguably one of the most important works of moral philosophy published\nin the twentieth century. Although Ross's view appeared\nto suffer at the hands of critics in the middle and late parts of the\nlast century, recent interest in normative and meta-ethical\nintuitionism has sparked a renewed respect for and admiration of his\nunique contribution to ethics, which is the focus of this\nentry.\n\n\nWilliam David Ross was born on 15 April 1877 in Thurso,\nScotland. He spent the bulk of the first six years of his life in\nTravancore, India, where his father, John Ross, was the Principal of\nthe Maharaja's College. Ross returned to Scotland for his\nformal education. He attended the Royal High School in Edinburgh and\nEdinburgh University. In 1895, he graduated from the latter with\nfirst-class honours in classics. He then went to Balliol College,\nOxford, where he obtained first-class honours in classical honour\nmoderations in 1898 and in literae humaniores in 1900. He was\nthen appointed lecturer at Oriel College, Oxford and at the same time\nhe was elected to a fellowship by examination at Merton College. In\n1902, he dropped the latter when he was elected tutor in philosophy\nand fellow at Oriel College, a position which he held until 1929. Ross\njoined the army in 1915, and by the time World War I ended he was\nDeputy Secretary in the Ministry of Munitions, with the rank of\nMajor. He left the army with an OBE. Following the war he remained in\npublic service on a part-time basis, and for his efforts he was made a\nKBE in 1938. From 1923 to 1928 he was the Deputy White's Professor of\nMoral Philosophy while John Alexander Stewart was ill.  When the\nposition became vacant in 1927, Ross refused to stand because he\nthought H. A. Prichard a better moral philosopher and because\n(interestingly) he said that he would ‘prefer working on\nmetaphysics, ancient and the most modern’ (Clark 1971, 534). Two\nyears later, in 1929, he became Provost of Oriel College, a position\nhe held until he retired in 1947. In 1927, he was elected Fellow of the British\nAcademy, and he served as its president from 1936 to 1940. During this\ntime he played a role in helping foreign scholars fleeing\nless liberal climates in Europe. In World War II he again played an\nessential role in the public service, serving on an Appeal Tribunal\nfor Conscientious Objectors (1940–41) and on the National Arbitration\nTribunal (1941–1952). He served as Vice-Chancellor of Oxford from 1941\nto 1944. Following the war, in 1947, he became President of the Union\nAcadémique Internationale, and, until 1949, the Chairman\nof the Royal Commission on the Press. In his retirement Ross continued\nhis work in philosophy. He died in Oxford on 25 May 1971. Ross's contributions to various\nadministrative positions and to public service were of no small\nimportance. But it is his work in philosophy which is the basis of his reputation. He made numerous contributions to the translation and\ninterpretation of Aristotle and to moral philosophy. In\nhis lifetime, Ross was considered a major figure in the study of Aristotle (Wiggins 2004). He was the General Editor of the\nOxford Aristotle translation series, first with J. A. Smith and then\nalone, and to this series he contributed translations of\nAristotle's Metaphysics and his\nNicomachean Ethics. Ross edited a number of\nAristotle's works in Greek for the Oxford Classical Texts series,\nincluding the Rhetoric, Physics, De Anima,\nand Politics, and he produced editions of the Metaphysics, Physics, Parva Naturalia, Analytics and De Anima with long introductions and detailed commentaries. On the basis of this work he produced two full-length books, Aristotle and\nPlato's Theory of Ideas (1951). In ethics, Ross wrote only a small number of articles. His books The Right and the Good\nand Foundations of Ethics comprise his main \nofferings in this area. To these he added a critical commentary on Immanuel\nKant's Groundwork,\nKant's Ethical Theory: A Commentary on the\nGrundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten, and a\nchapter on Aristotle's ethics in\nAristotle. \n\nIn the introduction to the sixth edition of Aristotle, J. L. Ackrill maintains that Ross ‘made his mark in public life and as a university teacher and administrator, and he wrote influential books on ethics. But it is as the leading Aristotelian of the first half of the\ncentury that he will be most remembered’ (AT ix). Indeed, many argue that Ross was one of the most influential Aristotelians of the twentieth century. Although some of Ross's translations now have formidable competitors, they are still highly regarded, and his editions of Aristotle's work with commentaries continue to be an important source for scholars working in ancient philosophy. One should not, however, overlook the fact that he now has an equally strong reputation in ethics. Despite the fact that Ross received rather short shrift from rival moral philosophers in the last century (e.g., Warnock 1960; Rawls 1971; Raphael 1981), his moral philosophy is now considered a serious contender and in recent years many of Ross's main\nmoral and meta-ethical doctrines have received sustained defenses (see, e.g., Hurka 2004; Stratton-Lake 2002a, 2002b, 2011a, 2011b; McNaughton 1988, 1996; Shaver 2007; Audi 1996, 2004; Gaut 2002; Parfit 2011). Therefore, it is not unreasonable to think that Ross's legacy will depend both on his work in ethics and on his work in ancient philosophy. \n\nRoss was part of a group of thinkers dubbed the British\nIntuitionists. H. A. Prichard was its main figure, and Ross was heavily\ninfluenced by his views (see\nPrichard 1912, 1932). He was also influenced by G. E. Moore (Moore\n1903, 1912). Ross subjected Moore's ideal\nutilitarianism to sustained attack. But he was more sympathetic to\nMoore's methodology for soliciting intuitions about\ngoodness and with some of Moore's ideas about the\nnature of intrinsic value and moral semantics. Finally, he could not\nhave helped being influenced by Aristotle's\ntreatment of ethical topics. He was in particular impressed with\nAristotle's methodology. \n\nRoss writes that the ‘moral convictions of thoughtful and\nwell-educated people are the data of ethics just as sense-perceptions\nare the data of a natural science’ (RG 41). The verdicts that\nthis body of moral convictions comprises represent ‘the moral\nreflection of many generations, which has developed an extremely\ndelicate power of appreciation of moral distinctions’ (RG\n41). These moral distinctions are employed to test moral theories;\nthese are cases of knowledge that the philosopher neither proves nor\ndisproves (RG 20–21n1, 40). Ross takes the requirement to capture\nthese main common-sense convictions to be more important than\nsimplicity or systematisation (RG 19; FE 83). This puts him at odds\nwith moral philosophers who take the systematization, the explanation,\nand the correction of common-sense morality as the main function of\nmoral philosophy. Henry Sidgwick, for instance, claims that ‘the\nphilosopher seeks unity of principle, and consistency of method’\nand that the role of the moral philosopher is to ‘enunciate, in\nfull breadth and clearness, those primary intuitions of Reason, by the\nscientific application of which the common moral thought of mankind\nmay be at once systematised and corrected’ (Sidgwick 1907\n373–374). \n\nThe precise degree to which Ross and Sidgwick are in disagreement is\nless than clear. Ross sometimes writes as though what he cares about is\nthe opinions of the ‘thoughtful and\nwell-educated’ (RG 41) or, what comes to the same\nthing, what ‘we’ think (RG 40; FE\n102, 104, 134, 172). At others times he suggests that what he cares\nabout is the opinions of the ‘plain\nman’ (RG 17, 20–21n1, 28, 57; FE 186, 187, 188; KT\n31). If the opinions of the thoughtful and well-educated are distinct\nfrom those of the plain man, and Ross (with some justification) cares\nmore about the former than the latter, he may have a\nmoral view that is closer on the matter of reform (though not of\nsystem) to Sidgwick's. This is not without certain\ncosts. Ross faults rival moral views for not being close enough to what\n‘plain men’ think about moral\nquestions. If he is open to revising a substantial portion of the moral\nviews that are ‘commonly\nrecognized’, then he loses part of his case against\nrivals. He does acknowledge that there are errors in our moral thinking\nand that we are not required to accept ‘as absolute\nall the claims that are commonly recognised’ (FE\n190; also 2–3; RG 41), though he thinks that most disputes concern\nmedia axiomata rather than fundamental moral principles (FE\n18–19, 190). However, he seems to invite more drastic possibilities. He\nnotes that inquiry into the ‘historical origin\nof…[our moral] beliefs and\npractices’ may show that ‘the\nmost strongly felt repulsions towards certain types of conduct are\nrelics of a bygone system of totems and fetishes, their connexion with\nwhich is little suspected by those who feel them’\n(RG 13). This may lead to significant revision (Singer 2005). Whatever\nthe case may be, the precise nature of Ross's view\nwill emerge only after a thorough account of its content is provided.\nAbout this data a number of questions emerge. What is its metaphysical\nstatus? How is it known? What is its precise content? The answers that\nRoss offers to these questions and his sensitivity to the dictates of\ncommon-sense morality together make up his unique contribution to moral\ntheory. \n\nArmed with an account of the main convictions of common-sense\nmorality, Ross attacked ideal utilitarianism and Kantianism, though\nideal utilitarianism, the view that the only basic moral requirement is\nto maximally promote a plurality of intrinsic goods, was his\nmain\n opponent.[1] \n\nRoss's basic complaint about his rivals is that\neach, in a different way, ‘over-simplifies the moral\nlife’ (FE 189). Both Kant and ideal utilitarians\nfail to capture some salient element of the ‘main\nmoral convictions of the plain man’ (RG 20–21n1).\nRoss contends that Kant oversimplifies the moral life in a number of\ndistinct ways. First, Kant is wrong to think that\n‘the rightness or wrongness of an individual act can\nbe inferred with certainty from its falling or not falling under a rule\ncapable of being universalised’ (FE 189; also KT\n25). Second, Kant is wrong to think that there is only one motive that\nhas value, and that the moral life consists in a\n‘contest between one element which alone has worth\n[i.e., the good will] and a multitude of others which have none; the\ntruth is rather that it is a struggle between a multiplicity of desires\nhaving various degrees of worth’ (FE 206; also KT 3,\n18, 93). Third, Kant is wrong to think that moral rules have\n‘absolute authority admitting of no\nexception’ (FE 313; also 134, 173; KT 24, 95). The\nideal utilitarianism of both Moore and Hastings Rashdall is guilty of a\nnumber of distortions of common-sense thinking (Moore 1903, 1912;\nRashdall 1907, 1913; Skelton 2011). First, it wrongly assumes that\nthere is a ‘general character which makes right acts\nright’, that of maximising a plurality of intrinsic\ngoods (RG 16). Second, in virtue of presupposing that there is only one\nthing that we ought all things considered to do it distorts our\nunderstanding of moral deliberation. For example, when deciding whether\nto fulfil a promise we think much more of the fact that in the past we\nhave made a promise than of the consequences we might realise by\nfulfilling it (RG 17). Third, ideal utilitarianism wrongly implies that\nthe only morally significant relation ‘in which my\nneighbours stand to me is that of being possible beneficiaries by my\naction’ (RG 19; OJ 125). \n\nOut of these criticisms emerges a distinct moral position,\nemphasizing the complexity of moral life. In a review of Foundations\nof Ethics, C. D. Broad writes that The Right and the Good\nwas ‘much the most important contribution to ethical\ntheory made in England for a generation’ (Broad 1940\n228). The best explanation of Broad's praise is that\nthe book presents a unique and compelling form of deontology, according\nto which there are a plurality of both moral requirements and intrinsic\ngoods. There is no one master principle that explains why the\nparticular things that we believe are wrong/right are in fact\nwrong/right. Instead, there are a number of basic moral requirements\nwhich cannot be reduced to some more fundamental principle. These are\nrelied upon in making decisions about what we ought to do all things\nconsidered, though there is no sense in which this is deduced from\nprinciples. There is no one intrinsic good/evil that explains why the\nparticular things we think are good/evil are in fact good/evil.\nInstead, there are a number of goods which cannot be reduced to some\nmore fundamental good. These are relied upon in making decisions about\nthe goodness or badness of a state of affairs all things considered,\nthough there is no sense in which this is deduced from these claims. It\nis his articulation of this particular view that makes\nRoss's work a lasting philosophical\ncontribution. \n\nThere is some dispute as to the precise number of principles to\nwhich Ross subscribes. It seems that he holds that there are five\nduties each of which rests on a separate and distinct ground and each\nof which specifies a factor which counts in favour of or against an act\n(Stratton-Lake 2002a, 2011a; Pickard-Cambridge 1932b; McNaughton 1996;\ncf. Jack 1971). Ross believes that we have a duty of fidelity,\nthat is, a duty to keep our promises (RG 21; FE 76–77; KT 21); a duty\nof reparation or a duty to act to right a previous wrong we have\ndone (RG 21; FE 76; KT 21); a duty of gratitude, or a duty to\nreturn services to those from whom we have in the past accepted\nbenefits (RG 21; FE 76; KT 21); a duty to promote a maximum of\naggregate good (RG 25, 27, 30; FE 67, 99, 130, 252, 257, 271, 313;\nKT 21); and finally a duty of non-maleficence, or a duty not to\nharm others (RG 21; FE 75, 130n1, 272). \n\nHe does not see these duties as equally important. He holds that the\nduty of non-maleficence is more important than the duty to promote a\nmaximum of aggregate good (RG 21, 22; FE 75, 130n1), and he suggests\nthat the duties of fidelity, reparation, and gratitude are in general\nmore weighty than the duty to promote the good (RG 19, 30, 41–42; FE\n77, 76, 90, 187). Unlike the duty to promote the good, the duties of\nfidelity, reparation and gratitude rest on personal relations with\nothers, which generate special rather than general duties (FE 76, 186).\nIt is important to Ross that we can stand in the obligation-generating\nrelations ‘of promisee to promiser, of creditor to\ndebtor, of wife to husband, of child to parent, of friend to friend, of\nfellow countryman to fellow countryman, and the\nlike’ (RG 19; also 22; FE 76; OJ 124, 126). Rival\nviews, as noted, ignore these morally significant relations, or the\n‘highly personal character of\nduty’, at their peril (RG 22). Finally, although he\ndoes not say it, his view would surely be that the duty of\nnon-maleficence is weightier than the duties of reparation, gratitude,\nand fidelity: it is (unless much is at stake) wrong to harm others in\norder to fulfil these duties. \n\nRoss's major innovation is that these principles\nstate prima facie rather than absolute obligations. This is an\nidea that simply had not occurred to critics of deontological theories\n(e.g., Mill 1863; Sidgwick 1907; Moore 1903, 1912; Rashdall 1907,\n1913), and therefore represented at the time a major advance in the\ndialectic existing between utilitarians and non-utilitarians. Ross\nclaims that ‘prima\nfacie’ is an unfortunate phrase on which to\nrely (RG 20; FE 84–85). It suggests that these only appear to be duties\nwhich further reflection might reveal to be illusory. This is not the\nview: these principles express real facts (RG 20; FE 85). There is a\nfurther worry, for these are not really duties of any kind (FE 84–85;\nRG 20). He thinks instead that these principles simply specify factors\nor features of a situation that speak in favour of or against, morally\nspeaking, an act or what to set ourselves to\n do.[2]\nThe fact that an act fails to fulfil a promise is a fact that counts\nagainst it, morally. The fact that an act promotes a maximum of\naggregate good is a fact that counts in favour of it, morally. One way\nto state what Ross has in mind, though this is controversial, is to say\nthat each principle specifies a fact that counts as a moral reason for\nor against an act (Stratton-Lake 2002a xx, 2011a; also KT 21). Ross\nsuggests another, equally plausible view, that each of the principles\nspecifies a responsibility (FE 85). Therefore, we have responsibilities\nto express gratitude, to compensate for past wrongs, to promote the\ngood, and so on. These responsibilities are what we are required to\ndraw on to determine what we ought all things considered to\ndo. \n\nIs this list of responsibilities complete? Ross intimates that this\nlist is the best representation of the core commitments of\ncommon-sense morality (RG 20; FE 190). He is confident that we have\nthese responsibilities. He states, for example, that\n‘the existence of an obligation arising from the\nmaking of a promise is so axiomatic that no moral universe can be\nimagined in which it would not exist’ (FE 77; also\nKT 42). He is not entirely confident that there exist only these\nresponsibilities; he offers this list ‘without\nclaiming completeness or finality for it’ (RG 20;\nalso 23). His view is not meant to be hostile to the idea that we might\nrecognise a ‘new duty’ in light\nof new circumstances (FE 189). However, he does hold that\n‘the general principles which it [i.e.,\nintuitionism] regards as intuitively seen to be true are very few in\nnumber and very general in character’ (FE 190). He\nseems to think that most disputes about the above list would\nrevolve around what should be added rather than what should be\nsubtracted or reduced, since the responsibilities listed above are\n‘authentic…duties’\n(RG 23). But if new circumstances can lead to the recognition of new\nduties, why may they not lead to the recognition that there are fewer\nduties than we might otherwise have supposed? This seems to be the nub\nof the issue between Ross and his ideal utilitarian foes. \n\nIdeal utilitarians and others are keen to argue that\nRoss's view is problematic because it is not\nsystematic enough. In Some Problems in Ethics, H. W. B. Joseph\nsuggested that views like Ross's go wrong, since\n‘our obligations are not a heap of unrelated\nobligations’ (Joseph 1931 92; also 67–68). Forty\nyears later, Rawls registered the same complaint: without some account\nof how the plurality of normative principles are to be weighed against\none another using ‘reasonable ethical criteria, the\nmeans of rational discussion have come to an end. An intuitionist\nconception of justice [and by extension ethics] is, one might say, but\nhalf a conception' (Rawls 1971 41). \n\nRoss is moved in part by this sort of worry. He initially lists what\nappear to be seven responsibilities, including a responsibility of\njustice (a responsibility to bring about ‘a\ndistribution of happiness between other people in proportion to\nmerit’ (RG 26)) and a responsibility of\nself-improvement (a responsibility to improve oneself in respect of\nvirtue and knowledge (RG 21)). He argues that these can be subsumed by\nthe responsibility ‘that we should produce as much\ngood as possible’ (RG 27; also 30; FE 288–89). But\nbeyond this reduction Ross will travel no further:\n‘loyalty to the facts is worth more than a\nsymmetrical architecture or a hastily reached\nsimplicity’ (RG 23; also FE 83; OJ 125). Indeed, he\nhas a very strong case against many of his critics, including Moore,\nRashdall, and Joseph, since they adopt a form of value pluralism for\nsimilar reasons. He has a further argument against Rawls.\nRawls's theory contains two principles of justice,\nlexically ordered. His first principle outlining a set of basic rights\ntakes priority over his second principle outlining the correct\ndistribution of social benefits and burdens. Rawls does not think it is\never right to violate rights in order to produce just distributions.\nThis gets him a theory that is as systematic as his classical average\nutilitarian rival and more systematic than Ross's\ntheory, but Ross can argue that Rawls achieves system at the expense of\nabsolutism, which many acknowledge to have counterintuitive\nresults. \n\nBut it is not clear that Ross has a lock on the best representation\nof common-sense morality. It is relatively clear that most hedonistic\nutilitarians are reformers of common-sense morality (e.g., Bentham\n1789; Mill 1863, 1843; Sidgwick 1907). These philosophers may not be\nmoved (at the level of moral foundations) by claims that their view\nconflicts with common-sense morality. For their aim in part is to\nrevise it. Ross gives hedonism short shrift because he thinks it\nobvious that pleasure is not the only thing that is intrinsically\nvaluable (RG 17, 99; FE 65). He often argues that ideal utilitarianism,\nlike hedonistic utilitarianism, can be dismissed because it is at odds\nwith common-sense morality (RG 17–19, 38). Yet, it is far from clear\nthat ideal utilitarianism is reformist like hedonistic or classical\nutilitarianism. The better way to represent the dispute between ideal\nutilitarians and Ross is over which view best represents common-sense\nmoral thinking. It is certainly the case that the main proponents of\nideal utilitarianism took themselves to be aiming to best represent\ncommon-sense morality (e.g., Rashdall 1907; Pickard-Cambridge 1932b\n152; Johnson 1953). \n\nAs Ross conducts it, the main dispute between the two revolves\naround the issue of whether ideal utilitarians can make sense of the\nobligation to keep one's promises.\nRoss's view is that ‘to make a\npromise is not merely to adapt an ingenious device for promoting the\ngeneral well-being; it is to put oneself in a new relation to one\nperson in particular, a relation which creates a specifically new\nprima facie duty to him, not reducible to the duty of\npromoting the general well-being of society’ (RG\n38). He employs the following example to illustrate his initial case\n(RG 34–35). Suppose that by fulfilling a promise to Edward you will\nproduce 100 units of good for him but that by breaking the promise and\ndoing something else that you have not promised to do you will produce\n101 units of good for James. The ideal utilitarian view entails that it\nis wrong to fulfil the promise: we must benefit James. But this is not\nthe verdict of common-sense morality. According to Ross, it takes a\nmuch greater disparity in value between the two to justify begging off\non the promise (RG 35; FE 77, 90). In reply, the ideal utilitarian\nargues that the common-sense verdict may be captured by noting that\nbreaking promises erodes mutual confidence and that keeping promises increases\nmutual confidence (RG 38). These goods and evils tip the balance in\nfavour of keeping the promise. But Ross thinks this a lame response.\nThere will no doubt be cases where all the benefits of breaking the\npromise will outweigh (though only very slightly) all the costs\nassociated with breaking it, and in this case the ideal utilitarian\nwill have to admit that it is obligatory to break the promise (RG 38).\nRoss thinks that this is not the verdict of common-sense morality. \n\nIn a set of engaging essays, W. A. Pickard-Cambridge pressed Ross on\nthe issue of whether ideal utilitarianism was actually as at odds with\ncommon-sense morality as Ross suggested (Pickard-Cambridge 1932a,\n1932b, 1932c). Pickard-Cambridge first argues that there are strong\ndirect and indirect reasons for taking promises very seriously\n(Pickard-Cambridge 1932b 153–157).  He further argues that\nideal utilitarianism accounts better for our intuitions about the\nfollowing kinds of cases: \n\nIn response to (1), Ross argues that we must insist on\n‘some common sense in the interpretation of the\npromise’ (FE 94; also 95, 96). Both Peter and Chuck\nassume that if by 3:00 Peter is rendered unable ever to use his violin, then the promise is null and void. But the ideal utilitarian may see a weakness here and urge that she can provide an\ninterpretation and that her interpretation and its explanation fits\nmore easily with common-sense morality. Peter and Chuck assume what\nthey do because no good would otherwise come from insisting on the\npromise being fulfilled. \n\nIn reply to (2), Ross contends that the promise ‘arose out of conversation with the miser, which was conducted under the implied contract to tell each other the truth’ (FE 97). Therefore the promise is null and\nvoid. The difficulty with this reply is that to secure it Ross has to contend that the implied contract stipulates that we are to tell each other the whole truth or all of the truth, and it is not clear that this requirement is one to which the plain man subscribes. It is not obvious that when I sell you something I am required to tell you all the truths about the item for sale. The ideal utilitarian is in a better position to explain why in the case of the miser the implied contract to tell the truth requires that one not state that one is a beggar when one is not and why it does not require us to tell all of the truth in other cases. The contract is specified this way because this produces good outcomes.  \n\nIn reply to (3), Ross contends initially that if Anne has\n‘a very delicate sense of honour’,\nthen she ought to consider paying the poor man on account of her\ncarelessness in agreeing unconditionally in the first place (FE 97).\nThis is not plausible. There is no reason to enrich an already rich person\nsimply because of carelessness (of this sort). Ross further argues that\nwhat is promised is not that Anne pay $100.00; rather, what is promised\nis that she pay a poor man $100.00, and since the man in question is no\nlonger poor, there is therefore no need to fulfil the promise (FE\n97–98). But what drives this interpretation of the promise? The ideal\nutilitarian may argue that the reason we interpret the promise this way\nis that doing so promotes the good. Furthermore, the ideal utilitarian\ncan argue that even without thinking of this interpretation of the\npromise we still believe that we have no or only very weak reasons to\npay, and that they can offer the best explanation of this fact. They\ncan also explain why this is (as Ross notes) a difficult issue to\ndecide: there are utilitarian reasons on either side. \n\nPickard-Cambridge further argues that ideal utilitarianism gives the\nbest explanation of the strength of a promise (1932b 159–163). Ross\nagrees that some promises are more binding than others, e.g., the\npromise to visit a sick friend is stronger than the promise to attend\nthe theatre with friends (FE 100). He suggests that the former is\nstronger because of the value of what is being promised (FE 100). In\ndiscussing his view that a casual promise is less binding and a recent\npromise is more binding he adds that this is due to the fact that the\nway in which and the time at which a promise has been made\n‘intensify the promiser's\nawareness of its existence and the promisee's\nexpectation of its fulfilment’ (FE 101). These\nresponses seem to play right into the hands of the ideal utilitarian:\nthe promise is more binding in the first case because of the greater\nvalue at stake and in the second case because the expectation and the\ndisappointment are greater, all of which are goods of the sort that the\nideal utilitarian claims we need to balance in deciding what we ought\nall things considered to do. \n\nRoss has one final reply to Pickard-Cambridge, using the following\nexample. A is dying. He entrusts his property to B,\non the strength of B's promise to give it\nto C. C does not know of A's intentions or\nB's promise.  B's activities will not\ndisappoint A or C, nor will his activities\nnegatively effect the general mutual confidence. Suppose\nthat D could make better use of the property\nthan C. It follows on ideal utilitarianism that B\nought to give the property to D. Ross thinks this breach of\ntrust ‘outrageous’ (FE 105).  \n\nThe version of ideal utilitarianism to which Pickard-Cambridge subscribes seems to entail that B has no reason to fulfil the promise to A. This is a problem for the view. However, Ross's own view seems to imply revision in this case. He argues that ‘when we consider ourselves bound…to fulfil a promise, we think of the fulfilment of the promise as the bringing into existence of some\nsource of pleasure or satisfaction for the person to whom we have made\nthe promise’ (RG 162). This suggests that the rightness\nof the promise depends on it producing some pleasure or satisfaction\nfor A. But since A is dead when B fulfils\nthe promise no pleasure or satisfaction can be brought into existence\nfor A, implying that B has no obligation by Ross's\nlights to fulfil the promise. Ross might drop this requirement and\nsuggest only that the fulfilment of a promise be ‘bonific’\nfor someone (e.g., C) (RG 36). This seems to put him at odds with the plain man in other cases. Consider a\ndeath-bed promise with a different content, that A be buried\nwith C, his wife. Suppose that this promise is not\nbonific. Ross will have to say that there is no reason to fulfil\nit. Hence, he'll have to advocate revision to common-sense\nmorality. Perhaps he can argue that his revision is more conservative\nthan the revisions required by ideal utilitarianism. But this is a\nvery thin difference, and may not be enough to give Ross the edge.\nGiven these worries and the fact that ideal utilitarianism seems quite\nclose to the plain man or common-sense morality in many of the other\nimportant cases, that it would entail that it is right to break the\npromise in the initial case above can hardly be considered a death blow. \n\nThe ideal utilitarian may not be satisfied with this outcome. Perhaps the more\nappropriate route for her is not to opt for revision\nto common-sense morality. For this may in the end give Ross a\nphilosophical advantage, especially if he drops the claim that it is a\nnecessary condition of act of promise keeping being right that it be\n‘bonific’ or promote some good and if he can find satisfactory replies to Pickard-Cambridge's objections.  Instead, perhaps the\nbetter strategy is to suggest that they can capture the importance of\npromise keeping to common-sense morality by holding that promise\nkeeping is intrinsically valuable or at least that promise breaking is\nintrinsically evil (Johnson 1953, 1959; Ewing 1957, 1959; Brennan\n1989; Shaver 2011). The general strategy is to subsume all of Ross's\nnon-utilitarian duties in this way. This is a compelling response. To\nassess it, it is important to examine his theory of value. \n\nIn RG, Ross contends that four things are intrinsically good:\njustice (happiness apportioned to merit),\n pleasure[3],\nknowledge and virtue (or, ‘virtuous disposition and\naction, i.e. action, or disposition to act, from any one of certain\nmotives, of which at all events the most notable are the desire to do\none's duty, the desire to bring into being something\nthat is good, and the desire to give pleasure or save pain to\nothers’ (RG 134)) (RG 134–141). Virtue, knowledge\nand pleasure are states of mind, while justice is a relation between\nstates of mind (RG\n 140).[4]\n These values are not of the same\nimportance. Ross holds that virtue is the most important and that some\nvirtuous motives are more important than others (e.g., the desire to do\none's duty is more valuable than the desire to\npromote others’ pleasure) (RG 152, 153, 164, 166).\nKnowledge is the next most important of the\n values.[5]\nKnowledge is more important than right opinion, since the former has\ncertainty which the latter lacks (RG 138–139, 146), and\n‘knowledge of general principles is intellectually\nmore valuable than knowledge of isolated matters of\nfact’ (RG 147). The least most valuable is \npleasure (RG 152). It is not clear where to place justice in this\nhierarchy, since Ross says only that it is\nless valuable than virtue (RG 153–154). It is not implausible to think\nthat it should be placed between (virtuous) knowledge and \npleasure, and therefore that the values are ranked as follows: virtue,\n(virtuous) knowledge, justice and pleasure. \n\nIn FE, Ross defends a slightly different view. He appears to maintain again\nthat there are four values: virtue, intellectual and aesthetic\nactivities, justice and (others’) pleasure (FE 19, 73, 180, 262,\n278, 288–289). In RG, Ross maintains that all intrinsic values\nare valuable in the same way: the goodness of good things is intrinsic\nto them (RG 115, 118, 132; also KT 11–12; OJ 119). But in FE he\nrevises this view. He contends that virtue and intellectual activities\nare ‘fit objects of admiration’ or objects ‘worthy\nof admiration’ (FE 282–283). The goodness of these things\nis a ‘quality intrinsic to them’ (FE 278). The values of\njustice and pleasure are ‘worthy objects of satisfaction’\nor things in which it is right to take satisfaction or an interest (FE\n275, 278, 282, 283, 289). The goodness of these things is not\nintrinsic to them; rather, it is a relational property, which depends\non our rightly taking an interest or rightly finding (some kind of)\nsatisfaction in them (FE 278). This appears to follow from the fact\nthat ‘while it is self-evident that the only ground on which a\nthing is worthy of admiration is that it is good in itself, it is not\nself-evident that the only ground on which a thing is worthy of our\ninterest or liking is that it is good in itself’ (FE\n 279).[6]\n This distinction allows Ross to explain why only innocent pleasures or\npleasures that are not undeserved or taken in the misfortune of others\nor in lust or in cruelty are good (RG 136–137; FE\n271–272), and why only the pleasure of others is good and hence\nwhy we think that we have to promote only them (FE 74–75, 272,\n276, 279, 283,\n 322).[7]\n The reason that only innocent pleasure is\nvaluable is that only it is worthy of satisfaction, and the reason\nthat only the pleasure of others is valuable is that only it is an\nobject of ‘sympathetic satisfaction’ (FE 276). One's own\npleasure is not an object of sympathetic satisfaction, since one\ncannot feel sympathy for oneself; instead, one's own pleasure is\nmerely an\ninevitable object of satisfaction (FE 75). \n\nThat in FE Ross holds that there are four goods is controversial. It has\nbeen suggested that in FE Ross rejects the view that pleasure is\nintrinsically good (Stratton-Lake 2002a xli–xlii, 2002b 130). This is hard to accept. He\nrepeatedly claims that the pleasure of others is \ngood (FE 278, 279, 282, 283, 322; KT 11–12; AT\n 232).[8] \nHe thinks we have a duty to promote the pleasure of others\nand that the basis of this judgement is that their pleasure is good (FE\n283, 284, 288). Finally, it really would be contrary to the plain\nman's view and to reflective thinking to deny that pleasure is a good and that pain is an\nevil.[9]\n\nThe view that Ross thinks that justice is good is also\nless clear. He often states that there are only three non-instrumental\ngoods (FE 19, 180, 262, 278; KT 11–12; OJ 119, 120, 121). In early\nwritings, he claims that justice is a requirement of duty not a value\n(OJ 123). However, since he suggests quite clearly at one point that he\nthinks that justice is good in the same sense that the pleasure of\nothers is good it is not unreasonable to think that he holds that\njustice is a good (FE 288–289). He also suggests at one point that promise\nkeeping is good in the same way that justice and pleasure are good (FE\n289). But he more often rejects the claim that promise keeping is good\n(FE 141, 142), suggesting that not all things that are objects worthy of\nsatisfaction are valuable.[10] \n\nIt is now possible to assess the second ideal utilitarian reply to\nRoss mentioned above. Some ideal utilitarians contend that his\nobjections to the view may be overcome by arguing that promise keeping,\nreparation, and gratitude are non-instrumentally valuable. The most\nplausible argument of this variety states that Ross must accept that\npromise keeping is valuable (or at least that promise\nbreaking is evil) because he accepts that knowledge and justice are\nvaluable and there is no real distinction between these values and the\nvalue of keeping promises or the disvalue of breaking promises (Shaver 2011). The\ncharacterisation provided above of Ross's theory of\nvalue provides him with a defence. He seems to insist on any occasions that only states of\nmind or relations between states of mind have value.\nPromise keeping, reparation, and gratitude are not merely states of mind or relations between states of mind. Therefore, they cannot be good.  \n\nOne worry is that knowledge is not merely a state of consciousness.\nIn RG, Ross insists that knowledge has intrinsic value. He sometimes\nsuggests this in FE. However, his considered view is that it is not\nknowledge but intellectual and aesthetic activities that have value (FE\n19, 27, 73, 180, 262, 266, 267, 278, 282–283, 284, 290, 296; also OJ 119,\n120, 121; KT 11-12). It is not unreasonable to think that Ross moved away from\nthinking that it is knowledge that has value and to thinking that it\nis intellectual (and aesthetic) activity that has value\nbecause only the latter is properly called a state of consciousness. This might be problematic for Ross. If he rejects the idea that knowledge is intrinsically\nvaluable while accepting that intellectual activities are\nintrinsically valuable, he cannot account for the fact that knowledge\nappears to be more important than justified opinion (Shaver 2011). But Ross can\nargue that knowledge is more important because of its instrumental\nproperties, e.g., it helps us better promote justice or morality or\npleasure. A fortiori the claim that it is intellectual\nactivities that are intrinsically good explains why some instances of knowledge are\nmore important than others. Ross says that ‘different\ninstances of this [intellectual] activity are good in proportion as\nthey are conducted according to these principles’ (FE 270),\ni.e., principles discovered by logic. Because more philosophical or\nmore general knowledge requires greater and more sophisticated use of\n‘the principles discovered by logic’ (FE 270), it is\nbetter. The value of the intellectual activities explains the value of\nthe knowledge. \n\nBut what about the fact that justice is an intrinsic value? It is\nnot a state of consciousness; it is a relation between states of\nmind(RG 140). If Ross is willing to accept this as\na good, why not accept that promise keeping, and so on, are good? It\nmight be that he can still insist that justice is different from\npromise keeping, reparation, and gratitude because it is compounded from states of consciousness and that is why it and not these other things\nare good. However, perhaps the better reply is simply\nto drop justice from his list of values. He repeatedly \ncontends that it is only states of mind that have value (OJ 118; RG\n122, 106–107, 140; FE 259, 270; KT 21), and justice is not a state of\nmind. He can insist on this view and block the ideal utilitarian\nresponse. He is open to characterising justice as a requirement of duty\nrather than a value (FE 319), and he loses little by dropping it as a\nvalue. Further, he might argue that understanding justice as a moral\nrequirement is the best way to think of it if one wants to capture what\nwe\n think.[11]\nIn this case, the burden of proof is on\nthe ideal utilitarian. \n\nRoss relies quite heavily on the Moorean isolation method to defend\nhis value theory (Moore 1903). His value theory came under much less\nscrutiny than did his deontic theory, and therefore he did not see fit\nto consider monistic responses to it. This may in part be due to the\nfact that there is agreement amongst his main rivals—Moore,\nRashdall, Pickard-Cambridge, Ewing, and Johnson—that value\npluralism is true. This may also be due in part to the fact that he\nconsidered the main monistic rival—that is, hedonism—a\ndead end (RG 98; FE 65). But hedonism lives on (Feldman 2004; Mendola\n2006; Crisp 2006; Bradley 2009). Therefore, it may be that Ross's\nvalue theory is in for a challenge that neither he nor his ideal\nutilitarian critics anticipated. \n\nTo get a taste of what this challenge may look like consider the\nfollowing hedonistic reply to Ross's argument for\nthe idea that virtue is intrinsically valuable. Hedonists hold\npace Ross that while it is obvious that virtue is\ninstrumentally good and vice is instrumentally bad, it is far from\nclear that the former is intrinsically good and the latter is\nintrinsically bad. In response, Ross asks us to imagine two\nworlds, W1\nand W2. W1\nand W2 include the same quantity of\npleasure. However, W1 contains agents that are\nvirtuous, who act from or who are disposed to act from the right\nmotives, while W2 contains agents who are vicious,\nwho act from or who are disposed to act from the wrong motives. Is\nnot W1 preferable to W2? Ross\nthinks it is, and he says that what explains this is that virtue is\nintrinsically good (RG 134). \n\nBut the hedonist has a reply. The situation envisaged is impossible,\nfor surely W1 would have more pleasure\nthan W2 because typically virtuous people produce\nmore pleasure than vicious people. Indeed, would not a world with\nvirtuous people be more likely to continue to be filled with pleasure\nand lack the possibility of descending into chaos than a world with\nvicious people? Is not this ultimately the reason why we desire or\nprefer it? In response, Ross reminds us that not all pleasure springs\nfrom the actions of virtuous people and not all pain springs from\nactions of vicious (RG 134). Some issues from ‘the operation of\nnatural laws’ (RG 134). Suppose, then, that there are two\nworlds, W1\nand W2. W1 contains virtuous\npeople and W2 contains vicious people, and that\nthe two worlds contain equal amounts of pleasure, because\nalthough W1-type worlds usually contain more\npleasure than W2-type worlds,\nW1's extra virtue-generated pleasure is offset by\n‘a much greater incidence of disease’, making the worlds\nequal in pleasure. Ross contends that it is still the case that the\nvirtuous world, W1, is better\nthan W2. \n\nThis is a good response, but the hedonist has a rejoinder. Would not\nW1 be on the whole better (hedonistically\nspeaking) in the long run because of the virtuous people? Would\nnot W1 be a place where it is more likely to be\nthe case that a cure is found or where it is more likely that pain is\ntreated effectively and sympathetically or where it is more likely to\nremain stable enough to handle the disease and illness? Ross may rely\non strategies that are similar to the ones he adopts against the ideal\nutilitarian's attempt to show that she can explain the importance of\npromise keeping (RG 38).  But it is clear that proponents of Ross's\nview of value may well have to contend with arguments of this variety\ngiven the recent resurgence of hedonism. \n\nHow do we acquire moral and axiological knowledge? Ross maintains\nthat ‘both in mathematics and in ethics we have\ncertain crystal-clear intuitions from which we build up all that we can\nknow about the nature of numbers and the nature of\nduty’ (FE 144). Our knowledge of the basic moral and\naxiological propositions which are the object of our moral intuitions\nis non-inferential (OJ 121, 123; RG 29, 146; FE 144, 172, 262, 320).\nThey are non-inferentially knowable because they are self-evident or\nknowable on the basis of an understanding alone (RG 20n1, 29; FE 320).\nFor example, that we have a responsibility to keep our promises is\nself-evident. It is by a process of reflection on this proposition that\nwe come to apprehend that we have this responsibility. Ross thinks we\ncan trust our moral apprehensions, and since apprehension is a matter\nof knowledge, and knowledge implies certainty, he is certain that we\nhave the above responsibilities and that certain things are\nintrinsically valuable (RG 146, 29, 30; KT 42; cf. Audi 2004). \n\nThat our responsibilities are self-evident does not entail that they\nare obvious to everyone who reflects on them. Ross maintains that a\nresponsibility is self-evident ‘not in the sense\nthat it is evident from the beginning of our lives, or as soon as we\nattend to the proposition for the first time, but in the sense that\nwhen we have reached sufficient mental maturity and have given\nsufficient attention to the proposition it is evident without any need\nof proof, or of evidence beyond itself. It is self-evident just as a\nmathematic axiom, or the validity of a form of inference, is\nevident’ (RG 29; also 12, 32; KT 42). The analogy with\nmathematics is instructive, for we acquire our moral knowledge in the\nsame way we acquire knowledge of mathematical axioms. We apprehend that\n2+2 = 4 by apprehending that 2+2 matches makes 4 matches and that 2+2\nballs makes 4 balls, and so on. We apprehend the algorithm in the\nparticular cases after repeated exposure to particular instances of its\napplication, by a process of intuitive induction (FE 170). We apprehend\nthat it is prima facie right to keep promises by apprehending\nthat it is prima facie right to fulfill this or that\nparticular promise. ‘What comes first in time is the\napprehension of the self-evident prima facie rightness of an\nindividual act of a particular type. From this we come by reflection to\napprehend the self-evident general principle of prima facie\nduty’ (RG 33; also FE 170). How do we decide what we ought to do, all things considered, in\nsome particular circumstance? What is the relationship between the\nresponsibilities we have and the ‘actual or absolute duty to do\none particular act in particular circumstances’ (RG 28)? Our\nself-evident responsibilities are not ‘principles by the\nimmediate application of which our duty in particular circumstances\ncan be deduced’ (FE 84; also 169; OJ 122, 127). Rather, one\ndetermines what one ought to do all things considered, that is, one's\nactual duty or one's duty proper, by reference to ‘all\nthe morally significant kinds it [the act] is an instance of’\n(RG 20; italics in original; also FE 84, 186; OJ 126–127). What\none has most responsibility to do or what is most suitable all things\nconsidered ‘belongs to an act in virtue of its whole nature and\nof nothing less than this’ (RG 28; also 33, 132). \n\nWe never know what we ought to do all things considered. Instead, we\nhave a ‘considered opinion’ or\n‘probable opinion’ regarding what\nwe ought all things considered to do in a particular situation (RG 19,\n30, 31, 33; FE 189, 190, 191; OJ 122, 123, 127). An example will help\nus here. Imagine that I can help my neighbour with his gardening\nproject and this will produce a lot of good for both of us. I have also\npromised you that I will meet you to discuss an assignment, but this\nproduces less good than helping my neighbour. Ross says that in this\ncase we have to balance the two responsibilities. He thinks that\ntypically the requirement to keep one's promises is\nmore stringent than the requirement to benefit other people (RG 19). In\nsuch situations what you ought to do is that thing\n‘of all those possible for the agent in the\ncircumstances, [that has]…the greatest balance of\nprima facie rightness, in those respects in which they are\nprima facie right, over their prima facie wrongness,\nin those respects in which they are prima facie\nwrong’ (RG 41; also RG 46). The act which is\none's actual duty or duty proper is the one for\nwhich one is most responsible or to which the weightier of\none's responsibilities attach (FE 85; RG 41–42).\n‘This sense of our particular duty in particular\ncircumstances, preceded and informed by the fullest reflection we can\nbestow on the act in all its bearings, is highly fallible, but it is\nthe only guide we have to our duty’ (RG 42). In the\nend, the decision regarding what to do, to use\nAristotle's phrase, ‘rests with\nperception’ (RG 42; OJ 127; Aristotle1109b23,\n1126b4). It is important to note that all of the responsibilities have\na valence, positive or negative, and this valence persists even when a\nresponsibility is outweighed by weightier responsibilities. \n\nThis epistemology has been attacked from a variety of different\nangles. One main worry is that there is very little agreement in\nintuitions, and this suggests that there is no fact of the matter as to\nwhat has value or what one is responsible for. Ross concedes that there\nis a lot of disagreement. His response begins by noting that a lot of\nmoral diversity rests not on ‘disagreement about\nfundamental moral principles, but partly on differences in the\ncircumstances of different societies, and partly on different views\nwhich people hold, not on moral questions but on questions of\nfact’ (FE 18). He thinks that most of the\ndifferences concern media axiomata, i.e., attempts to apply\ngeneral principles to particular circumstances, which rest on different\ncircumstances or different factual beliefs (FE 18–19). About these, he\nsays that intuitionists must have an open mind (FE 190). \n\nThere are many differences that cannot be explained away in this\nfashion, however (FE 19). There are differences as to the\n‘comparative worth of different\ngoods’ (FE 19) and as to the stringency of the\nresponsibilities Ross endorses (FE 186–188). These disagreements should\nnot, he thinks, undermine our confidence that there is objective moral\ntruth. It is very hard to see a resolution to these problems. He says\nthat despite changes in scientific theories there is a sense that\nscience progresses toward the truth. The same is true in ethics. There\nis no reason to ‘doubt that man progresses fairly\nsteadily towards moral truth as he does towards\nscientific’ (FE 20). The difficulty with this\nresponse is that whereas in scientific matters there is an independent\nway of establishing progress, there is no such independent or seemingly\nindependent way of establishing this in ethics. Recent research in the\nsocial sciences on moral judgement should not leave us confident\n(Greene 2008; Singer 2005). \n\nThe problems with Ross's moral epistemology are\ncompounded by the fact that he thinks that the principles of his\nframework best reflect the main elements of common-sense moral\nthinking, and that this is necessary to an acceptable moral theory.\nThis threatens to make his position appear parochial (Hare 1971). He is\naware of this worry. He replies by noting that the number of principles\nthat intuitionism endorses is small in number and general in content\nand that this leaves room to reject much of what is commonly taken to\nbe right (FE 190). This seems like the right kind of move to make.\nHowever, it puts him in a rather awkward position. If it really is true\nthat the number is small and that it is possible therefore to reject\nmuch of what is commonly recognized to be morally required, then the\nposition has a more reformist edge, and to the extent that it is\nreformist it is more rather than less like the other views that Ross\nrejects. In this case, it makes it much more difficult for him to fault\nhis rivals for not capturing common-sense morality. If he attempts to\nmove more toward the plain man's view, then although\nhe can more easily raise objections to ideal utilitarianism and other\nviews, he is much more likely to lose his critical element and\ntherefore fend off the charge of parochialism. The point may be made\nanother way. The more general and less robust his list of\nresponsibilities and goods the less likely the charge of parochialism\nmay stick, but it is also less likely that the view is as close to\ncommon sense as he suggests, in which case that his opponents deviate\nfrom it to some extent is not a mark against them or at least cannot be\nused by Ross as a mark against them. \n\nLike many in his time, Ross took pains to undermine various\ndefinitions of moral terms. He draws a distinction between\nnaturalistic and non-naturalistic definitions. The former are\n‘definitions which claim to define an ethical term without using\nany other ethical term’ (FE 6). The latter are definitions which\nattempt ‘to define one ethical term by the aid of another’\n(FE 6; cf. 42).  Ross rejects all naturalistic definitions of moral\nterms, including ‘right’ and (intrinsic)\n‘good’. In RG, he argues (following Moore 1912 and\nSidgwick 1907) that the moral terms ‘right’ and\n‘ought’ are incapable of definition: ‘right’\nis an ‘irreducible notion’ (RG 12). In FE, he suggests\nagain that ‘right’ is indefinable (FE 42), though he is\nsympathetic to the idea that ‘right’ is definable in terms\nof ‘suitable’ (FE 52–55). On this view, ‘this\nact is right’ means ‘this act has “the\ngreatest amount of suitability possible in the\ncircumstances”’ (FE 53; also 55). This is not a naturalist\ndefinition, since ‘suitability’ is itself a ‘unique\nand indefinable’ ethical notion (FE 146; also 159). In RG, Ross\nappears to reject all naturalistic attempts to define\n‘good’ (RG 78ff.). He is in particular keen to impugn\nviews that provide relational accounts of ‘good’; that is, views that define it in terms of some relation to a mental state, e.g., desire. His view appears to be that ‘goodness is a quality which\ncan no more be defined in terms of anything other than itself, than\ncan the quality of the sensation which we describe as being one of\n“seeing yellow”’(RG 86). In FE, he seems to affirm\nthe view that ‘good’ is indefinable (FE 262), though again\nhe seems sympathetic to a non-naturalistic definition, according to\nwhich ‘good’ is definable in terms of\n‘admirable’ or ‘commendable’ (FE 271, 283).\nHe says that this sense of ‘good’ applies only to things\nthat are intrinsically good in the sense of being objects worthy of\nadmiration, and (as noted above) only virtue and\nintellectual activity are worthy of admiration (FE 283). The notion\nof ‘good’ as applied to the goods of pleasure and justice\ncan be defined relationally. These goods are not objects worthy of\nadmiration but rather fit objects of satisfaction. Both notions of\ngood are in a sense definable, but the definitions are non-natural: in\nboth cases ‘good’ is defined in terms of\n‘worthiness’ or ‘rightness’ (FE 279, 282). \n\nRoss suggests a number of arguments against various (naturalistic and\nnon-naturalistic) definitions of moral terms. He relies in part on the\nfollowing kind of argument, which is directed at Moore (RG 8). If\n‘right’ and ‘being productive of the greatest good\nin the circumstances’ mean the same thing, then it is not the\ncase that it is intelligible that the proposition ‘the\n“right act” just is “the act productive of the greatest\ngood in the circumstances”’ should have been denied and\nmaintained ‘with so much fervour; for we do not fight for or\nagainst analytic propositions’ (RG 8).  It is intelligible that\nthese propositions should have been denied and maintained with so much\nfervour. Therefore, it is not the case that ‘right’ and\n‘productive of the greatest good in the circumstances’\nmean the same thing. This argument can be generalised to reject the\nusual suspects, e.g., ‘right’ means ‘approved of by\nme’ or ‘right’ means ‘approved of by the\nmajority of society’, and so on. But it is not the best\nargument, since we may well fight over analytic propositions,\nespecially when they are opaque or unobvious. \n\nRoss seems to acknowledge this sort of worry. He writes that\n‘the fact that we accept some definition as correct shows that\nthe term did somehow stand for a complex of elements; yet the fact\nthat we are for some time in doubt about whether the term is\nanalysable, and if so, what the correct analysis is, shows that this\ncomplex of elements was not distinctly present to our mind before, or\nduring, the search for a definition’ (RG 92–93). In reply, he\nsays that the only way to rebut the claim that ‘right’ and\n‘good’ are definable (naturalistically) is to examine\n‘all the definitions that possess any initial\nplausibility’ (RG 93). To these we should apply two tests (FE\n259; RG 93). First, we should determine whether ‘the definition\napplies to all things to which the term applies, and to no\nothers’ (FE 259; also RG 93). Second, we should ask whether the\nproposed definition expresses ‘explicitly what we had implicitly\nin mind when we used the term’ (FE 259; also RG 93). Using these\ntools, Ross rejects (among others) the position that ‘this act\nis right’ means ‘all or most men…react to the act\nwith a feeling of approval’ (FE 24). We often judge that an act\nis right even when we know that we are alone in holding this view (FE\n25). \n\nThese are not the only arguments on which Ross relies. Against the\nclaim that ‘right’ means ‘awakes in me the emotion\nof approval’ (FE 22), he argues that it is unable to explain\n‘the possibility of difference of opinion on the rightness of\nacts’ (FE 24). On this view, if I say ‘incest is\nimpermissible’ and you say ‘incest is permissible’\nwe are not disagreeing, since all I am saying is ‘incest awakes\nin me the emotion of disapproval’ and all you are saying is\n‘incest awakes in me the emotion of approval’, two\nstatements that appear to be ‘perfectly compatible’ with\neach other (FE 24). But we want to say that the two statements are not\ncompatible. Ross gives the same argument against the claim that\n‘X is good’ means ‘I have a certain feeling\ntoward X’. If I say ‘X is good’\nand you say ‘X is bad’, then you are saying that\nyou have a certain (negative) feeling toward X and I am\nsaying that I have a certain (positive) feeling toward X, two\nstatements that seem to be compatible with each other. Yet, he urges,\n‘if anything is clear, it is that we do suppose ourselves to be\nmaking incompatible statements about the object’ (RG 83). \n\nRoss also appears to reject various analyses of moral terms in order\nto preserve a certain way of conducting moral philosophy (Shaver 2007\n286, 295). He notes that ‘there is a system of moral truth, as\nobjective as all truth must be, which, and whose implications, we are\ninterested in discovering’ (RG 15; also 20, 29; KT 60). The\ndiscovery of these truths is not a matter of scientific\n(empirical) investigation. Ethical truths are not discovered by\n‘mere observation’ (FE 7; also 168). Instead, they are\n‘grasped by an intuitive act of human reason’ (FE 3).\n‘The use of the senses, and the physical sciences, give us no\npropositions in which ‘right’ or ‘obligatory’\noccurs as a term’ (KT 87). There are ‘two types of\npredicate—those that can be discovered by experience to belong\nto their subjects, and those that can be discovered by insight, and\nlet us grant that rightness belongs to the second class’ (KT\n81). In science, ‘sense-experience…furnishes…real\ndata’ (RG 40). In ethics, ‘no such appeal is possible. We\nhave no more direct way of access to the facts about rightness and\ngoodness and about what things are right or good, than by thinking\nabout them’ (RG 40; emphasis added; also 82). To entrench\nthis idea he draws analogies between mathematic and logical knowledge\nand ethical knowledge (RG 29, 30, 32; KT 42, 85; FE 320). He is fan of\nsynthetic a priori truths in ethics (and elsewhere) (FE 35–36;\nalso 320). Since it might be possible to arrive at ethical knowledge\nby means of (mere) experience if moral terms were reducible to natural\nterms, this provides Ross with an incentive to show that no such\nreduction is possible. He wants in short to protect a moral\nmethodology that prizes appeal to what ‘we’ think, the\nthoughts of the ‘best and most enlightened’ (FE 172),\nconsensus amongst experts (OJ 119–120; FE 191) and various kinds\nof thought experiments. Indeed, it has been suggested that through the\nuse of these tools it is possible to demonstrate that though\n‘right’ is not synonymous with a natural property it\nnonetheless refers to some natural property, e.g., what has the\ngreatest balance of justice, beneficence, fidelity, and so on, over\ninjustice, non-maleficence and infidelity, and so on (Shaver 2007\n289). (This may be controversial if such notions as\n‘justice’ are incapable of complete naturalization. If\ncomplete naturalization is not an option, then Ross may be forced to\nendorse a less palatable metaphysics.) \n\nRoss holds that the basic claims of morality express ‘facts\nwhich are self-evidently necessary’ (FE 320; also 262). Are\nthese objective facts of a special kind? The standard suggestion is\nthat for Ross moral facts are non-natural facts or non-natural\nproperties (Stratton-Lake 2002a xxi; Frankena 1963 86–87; 1973 103). It\nis not clear that he actually holds this view. He says very little\nabout the nature of moral facts except (perhaps unhelpfully) to\ncompare them to mathematical and logical facts. He does not appear to\ninfer from the fact that naturalistic definitions of moral terms fail\nthat therefore the terms refer to distinct properties. His focus is\nalmost entirely on definitions of ‘right’ and (intrinsic)\n‘good’. His concern is with what ‘we have in\nmind’ not with properties (FE 13, 42), though, problematically,\nhe often refers to ‘good’ as a ‘quality’ or\n‘characteristic’ or ‘property’ (RG 82, 87, 88,\n110, 122; FE 278, 279). He writes that ‘the difference between\ngoodness or value and such attributes as yellowness is there whereas\nthe latter are differentiae…of their possessors, the\nformer is a property (i.e. a consequential attribute) of\nthem’ (RG 121; italics in original). It is not clear that Ross\nintends this view to be an inference from his arguments against\nnaturalistic or other analyses. That he offers no explicit argument to\nthis effect suggests that he likely did not intend the inference\n(cf. Stratton-Lake 2002a), and he nowhere rules out that moral\nproperties are natural properties. At any rate, he does not need to\nmake this inference to achieve the aims he has in rebutting the\nvarious definitions he discusses. The arguments he uses are sufficient\nto preserve (in his view) plausible moral semantics, moral\ndisagreement, and his moral methodology. This should please the\nadherents of this view, though it still leaves Ross with the task of\nmaking sense of the nature of moral truth if it is not to be\nunderstood as correspondence to the moral facts. \n\nRoss's appeal to self-evidence and his defence of\nthe synthetic a priori may seem problematic to many, though\nrecent defences of these views suggest that their fortunes are\nimproving (Stratton-Lake 2002a, 2002b; Audi 1996, 2004; Crisp 2002; Parfit 2011). To\ndefend himself, Ross might simply eschew appeal to self-evidence and\ncertainty with respect to intuitions about general principles and\nreplace them with appeal to moral beliefs of high reliability or to\nconsidered convictions about moral claims (Griffin 1996; Rawls 1971;\nHooker 2000). This seems to give him what he needs methodologically.\nThe appeal to considered convictions allows him the ability to say, for\nexample, that we know directly that pain is bad and that it is wrong to\nharm others without good reason; in addition, he can avoid the defects\nof coherence theories of justification (FE 141). This (importantly)\nputs him on the same level as almost all moral theorists working today.\nIt is less clear that Ross is able to divest himself of synthetic a\nprior truths. But if his endorsement of the synthetic a\npriori truths is one way of securing the standard way of doing\nmoral philosophy, which involves appeal to thought-experiments,\nintuition, what we think, and so on, it is more difficult to reject. It\nis more difficult to reject still if we accept such claims in areas\noutside ethics and if we are not keen on (radical forms of)\nempiricism. \n\nRoss's contemporary importance in ethics rests on the fact\nthat he articulates one of the most plausible forms of deontology. He\noutlines a view that attempts to avoid the alleged deficiencies of\nutilitarianism without embracing the alleged excesses of Kantianism.\nIndeed, it serves as an important source of inspiration for those dissatisfied\nwith these positions. That these are found by many to be\nuninspiring explains the recent resurgence of Ross's\nview in ethics and applied ethics (Audi 2004; Beauchamp and Childress\n2008; Stratton-Lake 2011b). Ross also outlines a moral epistemology that is distinct from\nthe coherentist reflective equilibrium that has held sway over moral\nphilosophy for the last forty years. He relies on the idea that at the\ncore of ethics there are certain self-evident propositions that are\nmade true by moral facts, and which can be discovered by reflection on\nwhat we think about moral and axiological questions. Those dissatisfied\nwith the standard model for doing moral philosophy but who at the same\ntime find themselves attracted to the idea that ethical theories should\ncapture the main elements of common-sense morality do well to consult\nRoss's unique contribution to moral\nepistemology.","contact.mail":"askelto4@uwo.ca","contact.domain":"uwo.ca"}]
