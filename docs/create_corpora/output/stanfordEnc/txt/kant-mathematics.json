He developed\nconsidered philosophical views on the status of mathematical judgment,\nthe nature of mathematical definitions, axioms and proof, and the\nrelation between pure mathematics and the natural world. Moreover, his\napproach to the general question “how are synthetic\njudgments a priori possible?” was shaped by his\nconception of mathematics and its achievements as a well-grounded\nscience.\n\nKant's philosophy of mathematics is of interest to a variety of\nscholars for multiple reasons. First, his thoughts on mathematics are\na crucial and central component of his critical philosophical system,\nand so they are illuminating to the historian of philosophy working on\nany aspect of Kant's corpus. Additionally, issues of contemporary\ninterest and relevance arise from Kant's reflections on the most\nfundamental and elementary mathematical disciplines, issues that\ncontinue to inform important questions in the metaphysics and\nepistemology of mathematics. Finally, disagreements about how to\ninterpret Kant's philosophy of mathematics have generated a fertile\narea of current research and debate.\n\nIn 1763, Kant entered an essay prize competition addressing the\nquestion of whether the first principles of metaphysics and morality\ncan be proved, and thereby achieve the same degree of certainty as\nmathematical truths. Though his essay was awarded second prize by the\nRoyal Academy of Sciences in Berlin (losing to Moses Mendelssohn's\n“On Evidence in the Metaphysical Sciences”), it has\nnevertheless come to be known as Kant's “Prize Essay”. The\nPrize Essay was published by the Academy in 1764 under the title\n“Inquiry Concerning the Distinctness of the Principles of\nNatural Theology and Morality” and stands as a key text in\nKant's pre-critical philosophy of mathematics. In the Prize Essay, Kant undertook to compare the methods of\nmathematics and metaphysics (Carson 1999; Sutherland 2010). He claimed\nthat “the business of mathematics…is that of combining\nand comparing given concepts of magnitudes, which are clear and\ncertain, with a view to establishing what can be inferred from\nthem” (2:278). He claimed further that this business is\naccomplished via an examination of figures or “visible\nsigns” that provide concrete representations of universal\nconcepts that have been synthetically defined. For example, one\ndefines the mathematical concept <trapezium> by arbitrary\ncombination of other concepts (“four straight lines bounding a\nplane surface so that the opposite sides are not parallel to each\nother”[1]),\naccompanied by a “sensible sign” that displays the\nrelations among the parts of all objects so defined. Definitions as\nwell as fundamental mathematical propositions, for example, that space\ncan only have three dimensions, must be “examined in\nconcreto so that they come to be cognized intuitively”, but\nsuch propositions can never be proved since they are not inferred from\nother propositions (2:281). Theorems are established when simple\ncognitions are combined “by means of synthesis” (2:282),\nas when, for instance, it is demonstrated that the products of the\nsegments formed by two chords intersecting inside a circle are\nequal. In the latter case, one proves a theorem about any and all\npairs of lines that intersect inside a circle not by “drawing\nall the possible lines which could intersect each other within [the\ncircle]” but rather by drawing only two lines, and identifying\nthe relationship that holds between them (2:278). The “universal\nrule” that results is inferred via a synthesis among the\nsensible signs that are displayed, and, as a result, among the\nconcepts that the sensible signs illustrate. Kant concludes that the mathematical method cannot be applied to\nachieve philosophical (and, in particular, metaphysical) results, for\nthe primary reason that “geometers acquire their concepts by\nmeans of synthesis, whereas philosophers can only acquire\ntheir concepts by means of analysis—and that completely\nchanges the method of thought” (2:289). Yet at this pre-critical\nstage, he also concludes that, even lacking synthetic definitions of\nits primary concepts, “metaphysics is as much capable of the\ncertainty which is necessary to produce conviction as\nmathematics” (2:296). (Later, in the critical period, Kant will\nexpand the notion of synthesis to describe not only the genesis and\ncombination of mathematical concepts, but also the act of unifying\nmanifold representations. He will also, of course, use the terms\n“synthetic” and “analytic” to distinguish two\nmutually exclusive ways in which the subject and predicate concepts\nrelate to one another in distinct judgments of any kind, and he will\nemphasize an expanded sense of this distinction that encompasses a\nmethodological contrast between two modes of argumentation, one\nsynthetic or progressive and the other analytic or regressive. These\nvarious senses of the analytic/synthetic distinction will be addressed\nbriefly, below.) In the essays “Concerning the Ultimate Ground of the\nDifferentiation of Directions in Space” and “On the Form\nand Principles of the Sensible and the Intelligible World [Inaugural\nDissertation]” of 1768 and 1770, respectively, Kant's thoughts\nabout mathematics and its results begin to evolve in the direction of\nhis critical philosophy as he begins to recognize the role that a\ndistinct faculty of sensibility will play in an account of\nmathematical cognition (Carson 2004). In these essays, he attributes\nthe success of mathematical reasoning to its access to the\n“principles of sensitive form” and the “primary data\nof intuition”, which results in “laws of intuitive\ncognition” and “intuitive judgments” about magnitude\nand extension. One such judgment serves to establish the possibility\nof an object that is “exactly equal and similar to another, but\nwhich cannot be enclosed in the same limits as that other,\nits incongruent counterpart” (2:382) (Buroker 1981; Van\nCleve and Frederick 1991; Van Cleve 1999). Kant invokes such\n“incongruent counterparts” in “Directions in\nspace” to establish the orientability and actuality of a\nNewtonian-style absolute space, the object of geometry as he then\nunderstands it. He invokes the same example in the “Inaugural\nDissertation” to establish that spatial relations “can\nonly be apprehended by a certain pure intuition” and so show\nthat “geometry employs principles which are not only indubitable\nand discursive, but which also fall under the gaze of the mind.”\nAs such, mathematical evidence is “the paradigm and the\nmeans of all evidence in the other sciences” (2:403). (Later, in\nthe critical period's Prolegomena, he will invoke incongruent\ncounterparts to establish the transcendental ideality of space,\nthereby disavowing his earlier argument in support of absolute\nspace.) Kant's critical philosophy of mathematics finds fullest expression\nin the section of the Critique of Pure Reason entitled\n“The Discipline of Pure Reason in Dogmatic Use”, which\nbegins the second of the two main divisions of the Critique,\nthe “Transcendental Doctrine of Method.” In previous\nsections of the Critique, Kant has subjected pure reason\n“in its transcendental use in accordance with mere\nconcepts” to a critique in order to “constrain its\npropensity to expansion beyond the narrow boundaries of possible\nexperience” (A711/B739). But Kant tells us that it is\nunnecessary to subject mathematics to such a critique because the use\nof pure reason in mathematics is kept to a “visible track”\nvia intuition: “[mathematical] concepts must immediately be\nexhibited in concreto in pure intuition, through which\nanything unfounded and arbitrary instantly becomes obvious”\n(A711/B739). Nevertheless, the practice and discipline of mathematics\ndoes require an explanation, in order both to account for its success\nat demonstrating substantive and necessary truths, and also to license\nits invocation as a model of reasoning. Kant thus directs himself, as\nhe did in the pre-critical period, to the question of what accounts\nfor the “happy and well grounded” mathematical method, and\nalso of whether it is useful in any discipline other than\nmathematics. To answer this latter question in the negative, Kant must\nexplain the uniqueness of mathematical reasoning. The central thesis of Kant's account of the uniqueness of\nmathematical reasoning is his claim that mathematical cognition\nderives from the “construction” of its concepts:\n“to construct a concept means to exhibit a\npriori the intuition corresponding to it” (A713/B741)\n(Friedman 1992, Friedman 2010). For example, while the concept\n<triangle> can be discursively defined as a rectilinear figure\ncontained by three straight lines (as is done in\nEuclid's Elements), the concept is constructed, in\nKant's technical sense of the term, only when such a definition is\npaired with a corresponding intuition, that is, with a singular and\nimmediately evident representation of a three sided figure. Kant\nargues that when one so renders a triangle for the purposes of\nperforming the auxiliary constructive steps necessary for geometric\nproof, one does so a priori, whether the triangle is produced\non paper or only in the imagination. This is because in neither case\ndoes the object displayed borrow its pattern from any experience\n(A713/B741). Moreover, one can derive universal truths about all\ntriangles from such a singular display of an individual triangle since\nthe particular determinations of the displayed object, e.g., the\nmagnitude of its sides and angles, are “entirely\nindifferent” to the ability of the rendered triangle to exhibit\nthe general concept <triangle> (A714/B742). Kant's account must\nthus be defended against the commonly held position that universal\ntruths cannot be derived from reasoning that depends on\nparticular representations. (Relatedly, the less than perfectly\nstraight sides of an empirically rendered triangle are likewise\n“indifferent” and so such an empirical intuition is\nconsidered adequate for geometric proof. This raises questions about\nhow one can be sure that an intuition adequately displays the content\nof a concept, the relation between pure and empirical intuition, and,\nin particular, which of the intuitively displayed features can safely\nbe ignored (Friedman 2010, Friedman 2012).) Ultimately, Kant claims that it is “only the concept of\nmagnitudes” (quantities) that can be constructed in pure\nintuition, since “qualities cannot be exhibited in anything but\nempirical intuition” (A714/B742) (Sutherland 2004a; 2004b,\n2005a). This leads to a principled distinction between mathematical\nand philosophical cognition: while philosophical cognition is confined\nto the results of an abstract conceptual analysis, mathematical\ncognition is the result of a “chain of inferences that is always\nguided by intuition”, that is, by a concrete representation of\nits objects (Hintikka 1967, Parsons 1969, Friedman 1992). Kant strains\nsomewhat to explain how the mathematician constructs arithmetic and\nalgebraic magnitudes, which are distinct from the spatial figures that\nare the object of geometric reasoning. Drawing a distinction between\n“ostensive” and “symbolic” construction, he\nidentifies ostensive construction with the geometer's practice of\nshowing or displaying spatial figures, whereas symbolic construction\ncorrelates to the act of concatenating arithmetic or algebraic symbols\n(as when, for example, “one magnitude is to be divided by\nanother, [mathematics] places their symbols together in accordance\nwith the form of notation for division…”) (A717/B745)\n(Brittan 1992, Shabel 1998). Kant claims further that the pure concept of magnitude is suitable\nfor construction because, unlike other pure concepts, it does not\nrepresent a synthesis of possible intuitions, but\n“already contains a pure intuition in itself.” But since\nthe only candidates for such “pure intuitions” are space\nand time (“the mere form of appearances”), it follows that\nonly spatial and temporal magnitudes can be exhibited in pure\nintuition, i.e., constructed. Such spatial and temporal magnitudes can\nbe exhibited qualitatively, by displaying the shapes of things,\ne.g. the rectangularity of the panes of a window, or they can be\nexhibited merely quantitatively, by displaying the number of parts of\nthings, e.g., the number of panes that the window comprises. In either\ncase, what is displayed counts as a pure and “formal\nintuition”, inspection of which yields judgments that “go\nbeyond” the content of the original concept with which the\nintuition was associated. Such judgments are paradigmatically\nsynthetic a priori judgments (to be discussed at greater\nlength below) since they are ampliative truths that are warranted\nindependent of experience (Shabel 2006). Kant argues that mathematical reasoning cannot be employed outside\nthe domain of mathematics proper for such reasoning, as he understands\nit, is necessarily directed at objects that are\n“determinately given in pure intuition a priori and\nwithout any empirical data” (A724/B752). Since only\nformal mathematical objects (i.e. spatial and temporal magnitudes) can\nbe so given, mathematical reasoning is useless with respect\nto materially given content (though the truths that result\nfrom mathematical reasoning about formal mathematical objects are\nfruitfully applied to such material content, which is to say that\nmathematics is a priori true of the appearances.)\nConsequently, the “thorough grounding” that mathematics\nfinds in its definitions, axioms, and demonstrations cannot be\n“achieved or imitated” by philosophy or physical sciences\n(A727/B755). While Kant's theory of mathematical concept construction can be\nthought of as providing an explanation of mathematical practice as\nKant understood \n it[2], \n the theory is intertwined with Kant's\nbroader commitments to strict distinctions between intuitions and\nconcepts, as modes of representation; between the mental faculties of\nsensibility and understanding; between synthetic and analytic\njudgments; and between a priori and a posteriori\nevidence and reasoning. Ultimately, the picture of mathematics\ndeveloped in the Discipline of Pure Reason in Dogmatic Use depends on\nthe full theory of judgment that the Critique aims to\nprovide, and crucially on the theory of sensibility that Kant offers\nin The Transcendental Aesthetic (Parsons 1992, Carson 1997), as well\nas in corresponding passages in the Prolegomena's Main\nTranscendental Question, First Part, where he investigates the\n“origin” of the pure sensible concepts of mathematics, and\nthe “scope of their \nvalidity” (A725/B753).[3] Kant asks two related leading questions of his critical philosophy:\n(1) How are synthetic judgments a priori possible?; and, (2)\nHow is metaphysics possible as a science (B19; B23)? Mathematics\nprovides a special avenue for helping to answer these questions by\nproviding a model of a codified scientific discipline the possibility\nof which is clear and, moreover, guaranteed by its own achievement of\ncognition that is both synthetic and a priori. In other\nwords, an explanation of how synthetic a priori judgments are\naffirmed in mathematical contexts, together with the resulting and\nrelated explanation of how a systematic body of demonstrable knowledge\ncomprises such judgments, allow mathematical truth to be invoked as a\nparadigm of the substantive yet necessary and universal truths that\nmetaphysics hopes to achieve. Kant's theory of mathematical concept\nconstruction (discussed above) can only be fully appreciated in\nconjunction with his treatment of such broader questions about the\nvery nature and possibility of mathematical and metaphysical\nknowledge. In both the Preamble to the Prolegomena to Any Future\nMetaphysics and the B-Introduction to the Critique of Pure\nReason, Kant introduces the analytic/synthetic distinction, which\ndistinguishes between judgments the predicates of which belong to or\nare contained in the subject concept and judgments the predicates of\nwhich are connected to but go beyond the subject concept,\nrespectively. In each text, he follows his presentation of this\ndistinction with a discussion of his claim that all mathematical\njudgments are synthetic and a\n priori.[4]\nThere he claims, first, that “properly mathematical judgments\nare always a priori judgments” on the grounds that they\nare necessary, and so cannot be derived from experience (B14). He\nfollows this with an explanation of how such non-empirical judgments\ncan yet be synthetic, that is, how they can serve to synthesize a\nsubject and predicate concept rather than merely explicate or analyze\na subject concept into its constituent logical parts. Here he famously\ninvokes the proposition “7 + 5 = 12” and argues\nnegatively, claiming that “no matter how long I analyze my\nconcept of such a possible sum [of seven and five] I will still not\nfind twelve in it”, and also positively, claiming that\n“One must go beyond these concepts [of seven and five], seeking\nassistance in the intuition that corresponds to one of the two, one's\nfive fingers, say…and one after another add the units of the\nfive given in the intuition to the concept of seven…and thus\nsee the number 12 arise” (B15). He takes it to follow that the\nnecessary truth of an arithmetic proposition such as “7 + 5 =\n12” cannot be established by any method of logical or conceptual\nanalysis (Anderson 2004), but can be established by intuitive\nsynthesis (Parsons 1969). He follows this discussion of arithmetic\nreasoning and truth with corresponding claims about Euclidean\ngeometry, according to which the principles of geometry express\nsynthetic relations between concepts (such as between the concept of\nthe straight line between two points and the concept of the shortest\nline between those same two points), neither of which can be\nanalytically “extracted” from the other. The principles of\ngeometry thus express relations among basic geometric concepts\ninasmuch as these can be “exhibited in intuition” (Shabel\n2003, Sutherland 2005a). Elsewhere, Kant also includes geometric theorems as the\nsorts of propositions (in addition to geometric principles) that count\nas synthetic (Friedman 1992, Friedman 2010). But Kant's account of the\nsyntheticity of such theorems is not transparent. Having denied that\nthe principles (Grundsätze) could be cognized\nanalytically from the principle of contradiction, he admits that\nmathematical inference of the kind needed to establish\ngeometric theorems does proceed “in accordance with the\nprinciple of contradiction”, and also that “a synthetic\nproposition can of course be comprehended in accordance with the\nprinciple of contradiction” though “only insofar as\nanother synthetic proposition is presupposed from which it can be\ndeduced, never in itself” (B14). So, while he is clear that all\nmathematical judgments, including geometric theorems, are synthetic,\nhe is less clear about exactly what it means for such propositions or\nthe inferences that support them to “accord with” the\nprinciple of contradiction, derivability from which he takes to be the\nparadigm test of analyticity. This leads to an interpretive disagreement as to whether demonstrable mathematical\njudgments follow from the synthetic principles via strictly logical or\nconceptual inference—and so in strict accordance\nwith only the principle of contradiction—or whether\nthey are deduced via inferences that are themselves reliant on\nintuition, but which do not violate the law of contradiction. There is\nthus disagreement over whether Kant is committed merely to the\nsyntheticity of the axioms of mathematics (which transmit syntheticity\nto demonstrable theorems via logical inference), or is also committed\nto the syntheticity of mathematical inference itself. The former\ninterpretive position is associated with Ernst Cassirer and Lewis\nWhite Beck; the latter position with Bertrand Russell (Hogan\nforthcoming). Gordon Brittan (Brittan 2006) conceives both such\npositions “evidentialist”, which is his label for any\ninterpretation according to which intuitions provide indispensable\nevidence for the truth of mathematics, whether that evidence is\nprovided in support of axioms or inferences, or both. According to his\nalternative “objectivist” position, intuitions do not\nprovide evidence but are rather semantic vehicles of singular\nreference and “objective reality” (Brittan 2006). Attention to this interpretive issue in Kant's philosophy of\nmathematics is vital for the light it sheds on the more general\nquestion of what makes synthetic a priori cognition possible,\nthe central question of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. With\nrespect to this more general question, it is important to\ndifferentiate Kant's use of the terms “analytic” and\n“synthetic” to mark a logico-semantic distinction between\ntypes of judgments—which Kant uses to defend the distinctive\nthesis that mathematical cognition is synthetic a\npriori—from his use of the same terms to mark a traditional\nmathematical distinction, between analytic and\nsynthetic methods (Beaney 2012). He deploys the latter\ndistinction in order to identify two distinct argumentative strategies\nfor answering the question of the “possibility of pure\nmathematics.” The analytic method is characterized by reasoning\nthat traces a given body of cognition, such as mathematics, to its\norigin or sources in the mind. By contrast, the synthetic method aims\nto derive real cognition directly from such original cognitive\nsources, which sources or powers are first explicated independently of\nany particular body of cognition (including mathematics) that the\npowers might ultimately produce. Kant adopts the former method in\nhis Prolegomena, arguing from the synthetic and a\npriori nature of mathematical judgment to the claim that space\nand time are the forms of human sensibility; he adopts the latter\nmethod in the Critique of Pure Reason, arguing that the forms\nof human sensibility, space and time, provide the basis from which to\nderive synthetic and a priori mathematical judgments (Shabel\n2004). These arguments, together with the details of his account of\nthe synthetic and a priori nature of all mathematical\njudgment, provide an answer to the question of the possibility of\nmathematics: the practices that yield the paradigmatically synthetic\nand a priori judgments of the science of mathematics are\ngrounded in and explained by the very nature of human sensibility,\nand, in particular, by the spatio-temporal form of all (and only) the\nobjects of human experience (Van Cleve 1999). Kant's theory of mathematical practice connects not only with his\ntheory of sensibility (as described above) but also with other aspects\nof the doctrine of Transcendental Idealism, as it is articulated\nthroughout Kant's critical works. In the Transcendental Analytic, Kant deduces the table of twelve\ncategories, or pure concepts of the understanding, the first six of\nwhich he describes as “mathematical” (as opposed to\n“dynamical”) categories because of their concern with\nobjects of intuition (B110). The concept of number is treated as\n“belonging” to the category of “allness” or\ntotality, which is itself thought to result from the combination of\nthe concepts of unity and plurality (Parsons 1984). But, Kant claims\nfurther that difficulties that arise in the representation of\ninfinities—in which one allegedly represents unity and plurality\nwith no resulting representation of number—reveal that\na concept of number must require the mediation of “a special act\nof the understanding” (B111). (This special act is presumably\nthe synthesis that Kant describes as a function of both\nimagination and understanding, and which it is the business of the\nfull theory of judgment—including the Transcendental Deduction\nand the Schematism—to explain (Longuenesse 1998).) So, though he\nalso claims that arithmetic “forms its concepts of numbers\nthrough successive addition of units in time” (4:283), it is\nmisleading to infer that arithmetic is to time as geometry is to\nspace, since a formal intuition of time is inadequate to explain the\ngeneral and abstract science of \nnumber.[5] \n (In fact, Kant declares mechanics to be the\nmathematical science that is to time what geometry is to space.) In the Schematism, Kant undertakes to identify the particular\nmechanism that enables the pure concepts of the understanding to\nsubsume sensible intuitions, with which they are heterogeneous. The\ncategories must be “schematized” because their\nnon-empirical origin in pure understanding prevents their having the\nsort of sensible content that would connect them immediately to the\nobjects of experience; transcendental schemata are mediating\nrepresentations that are meant to establish the connection between\npure concepts and appearances in a rule-governed way. Mathematical\nconcepts are discussed in this context since they are unique in being\npure but also sensible concepts: they are pure because they are\nstrictly a priori in origin, and yet they are sensible since\nthey are constructed in concreto. (Kant further complicates\nthis issue by identifying number as the pure schema of the category of\nmagnitude (Longuenesse 1998).) There arises an interpretive question\nas to whether mathematical concepts, whose conceptual content is given\nsensibly, require schematization by a distinguishable “third\nthing”, and, if so, what it amounts to (Young 1984). More\nbroadly, the question arises as to how the transcendental imagination,\nthe faculty responsible for schematism, operates in mathematical\ncontexts (Domski 2010). Finally, in the Analytic of Principles, Kant derives the synthetic\njudgments that “flow a priori from pure concepts of the\nunderstanding” and which ground all other a priori\ncognitions, including those of mathematics (A136/B175). The principles\nof pure understanding that are associated with the categories of\nquantity (i.e., unity, plurality and totality) are the Axioms of\nIntuition. Whereas mathematical principles proper are “drawn\nonly from intuition” and so do not constitute any part of the\nsystem of principles of pure understanding, the explanation for the\npossibility of such mathematical principles (outlined above) must be\nsupplemented by an account of the highest possible transcendental\nprinciples (A148–9/B188–9). Accordingly, the Axioms of\nIntuition provide a meta-principle, or principle of the\nmathematical principles of quantity, namely that “All intuitions\nare extensive magnitudes” (A161/B202). Most commentators\ninterpret Kant here to be indicating why the principles of\nmathematics, which have to do with pure space and time, are applicable\nto the appearances: the appearances can only be represented\n“through the same synthesis as that through which space and time\nin general are determined” (A161/B202). So, all\nintuitions, whether pure or empirical, are “extensive\nmagnitudes” that are governed by the principles of\nmathematics. Expressing an alternative view, Daniel Sutherland sees\nthe Axioms of Intuition as concerning “not only the\napplicability of mathematics but the possibility of any mathematical\ncognition whatsoever, whether pure or applied, general or\nspecific” and so as having wider significance than has been\nappreciated (Sutherland 2005b). (It is also notable that key passages in the Critique of the\nPower of Judgment deal with mathematics and the\n“mathematical sublime” (Breitenbach 2015). See\nespecially [5:248ff].) Kant's conception of mathematics was debated by his contemporaries;\ninfluenced and provoked Frege, Russell and Husserl; and provided\ninspiration for Brouwerian Intuitionism. His conception of mathematics\nwas rejuvenated as worthy of close historical study by Gottfried\nMartin's 1938 monograph Arithmetik und Kombinatoric bei Kant\n(Martin 1985). Despite the very different positions that contemporary\ncommentators develop as to how best to understand Kant's thought, they\nare broadly united in opposing a long-standard story (perhaps\noriginally promoted by Bertrand Russell in his Principles of\nMathematics and by Rudolph Carnap in his Philosophical\nFoundations of Physics) according to which the development of\nmodern logic in the 19th and 20th centuries, the\ndiscovery of non-Euclidean geometries, and the formalization of\nmathematics renders Kant's intuition-based theory of mathematics and\nrelated philosophical commitments obsolete or irrelevant. Contemporary\ncommentators seek to reconstruct Kant's philosophy of mathematics from\nthe vantage of Kant's own historical context and also to identify the\nelements of Kant's philosophy of mathematics that are of eternal\nphilosophical interest. In recent times, scholarship on Kant's philosophy of mathematics\nhas been influenced most strongly by an enduring debate between Jaakko\nHintikka and Charles Parsons over what have come to be known as the\n“logical” and “phenomenological”\ninterpretations of Kant; by Michael Friedman's seminal book, Kant\nand the Exact Sciences (Friedman 1992), as well as his now\nclassic articles “Kant's Theory of Geometry” and\n“Geometry, Construction and Intuition in Kant and his\nSuccessors” (Friedman 1985, 2000); and by the papers collected\nin Carl Posy's volume Kant's Philosophy of Mathematics (which\nincludes contributions by Hintikka, Parsons and Friedman, as well as\nby Stephen Barker, Gordon Brittan, William Harper, Philip Kitcher,\nArthur Melnick, Carl Posy, Manley Thompson, and J.Michael Young, all\nof which were published more than twenty years ago (Posy\n1992).)[6] New\ngenerations of scholars contribute to a lively, fertile and ongoing\ndiscussion about the interpretation and legacy of Kant's philosophy of\nmathematics that originated with this literature. The interpretive debate over how to understand Kant's view of the\nrole of intuition in mathematical reasoning has had the strongest\ninfluence on the shape of scholarship in Kant's philosophy of\nmathematics; this debate is directly related to the question\n(described above) of the syntheticity of mathematical axioms, theorems\nand inferences. In his general discussion of mental representation,\nKant implies that immediacy and singularity are both criteria of\nnon-conceptual, intuitive representation, the species of\nrepresentation that grounds synthetic judgment. In a series of papers,\nCharles Parsons (Parsons 1964, 1969, 1984) has argued that the\nsyntheticity of mathematical judgments depends on mathematical\nintuitions being fundamentally immediate, and he explains the\nimmediacy of such representations in a perceptual way, as a direct,\nphenomenological presence to the mind. Jaakko Hintikka (Hintikka 1965,\n1967, 1969), developing an idea from E.W. Beth's earlier work,\ncounters that the syntheticity of mathematical judgments instead\ndepends only on the singularity of their intuitive\nconstituents. Hintikka assimilates mathematical intuitions to singular\nterms or particulars, and explains the use of intuition in a\nmathematical context by analogy to the logical move of existential\ninstantiation. These two positions have come to be known as the\n“phenomenological” and “logical”\ninterpretations, respectively. Michael Friedman's original position (Friedman 1985, 1992) with\nrespect to the role of intuition in mathematical reasoning descends\nfrom Beth's and Hintikka's, though it is substantially different from\ntheirs and has been modified in his most recent writings. In\nhis Kant and the Exact Sciences (Friedman 1992), Friedman\ntakes the position that our modern conception of logic ought to be\nused as a tool for interpreting (rather than criticizing) Kant, noting\nthat the explicit representation of an infinity of mathematical\nobjects that can be generated by the polyadic logic of modern\nquantification theory is conceptually unavailable to the mathematician\nand logician of Kant's time. As a result of the inadequacy of monadic\nlogic to represent an infinity of objects, the eighteenth-century\nmathematician relies on intuition to deliver the representations\nnecessary for mathematical reasoning. Friedman explicates the details\nof Kant's philosophy of mathematics on the basis of this historical\ninsight. Friedman has modified his original position in response to\ncriticism from Emily Carson (Carson 1997), who has developed an\ninterpretation of Kant's theory of geometry that is Parsonsian in its\nanti-formalist emphasis on the epistemological and phenomenological\nover the logical role for intuition in mathematics. In recent work\n(Friedman 2000, 2010), Friedman argues that the intuition that grounds\ngeometry is fundamentally kinematical, and is best explained by the\ntranslations and rotations that describe both the constructive action\nof the Euclidean geometer and the perceptual point of view of the\nordinary, spatially oriented observer. This new account provides a\nsynthesis between the logical and phenomenological interpretive\naccounts, in large part by connecting the geometrical space that is\nexplored by the imagination via Euclidean constructions to the\nperspectival space that is, according to Kant, the form of all outer\nsensibility. More specifically, he reconciles the logical with the\nphenomenological by “[embedding] the purely logical\nunderstanding of geometrical constructions (as Skolem functions)\nwithin space as the pure form of our outer sensible intuition (as\ndescribed in the Transcendental Aesthetic)” (Friedman 2012,\nn.17).","contact.mail":"shabel.1@osu.edu","contact.domain":"osu.edu"}]
