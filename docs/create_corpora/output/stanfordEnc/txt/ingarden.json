A student of Edmund Husserl’s from the\nGöttingen period, Ingarden was a realist phenomenologist who spent\nmuch of his career working against what he took to be Husserl’s turn to\ntranscendental idealism. As preparatory work for narrowing down\npossible solutions to the realism/idealism problem, Ingarden developed\nontological studies unmatched in scope and detail, distinguishing\ndifferent kinds of dependence and different modes of being. He is best\nknown, however, for his work in aesthetics, particularly on the\nontology of the work of art and the status of aesthetic values, and is\ncredited with being the founder of phenomenological aesthetics. His\nwork The Literary Work of Art has been widely influential in\nliterary theory as well as philosophical aesthetics, and has been\ncrucial to the development of New Criticism and Reader Response\nTheory.\n\n\n\nRoman Witold Ingarden was born on February 5, 1893 in Kraków.\nHe initially studied mathematics and philosophy in Lwów (now\nknown as ‘Lviv’ and in Ukraine), and in 1912 went to\nGöttingen where he studied philosophy under Edmund Husserl,\ntaking four semesters of seminars with Husserl, from 1912 to 1914, and\nagain during the summer of 1915. Husserl considered Ingarden one of\nhis best students, and the two remained in close touch until Husserl’s\ndeath in 1938 (their philosophical correspondence was eventually\npublished as Husserl’s Briefe an Roman Ingarden).  Ingarden\nalso studied philosophy in Lwów with Kazimierz Twardowski (who,\nlike Husserl, was a student of Franz Brentano). When Husserl accepted\nthe chair at Freiburg, Ingarden followed him, submitting his\ndissertation “Intuition und Intellekt bei Henri\nBergson” in 1917, for which he received his Ph.D. in 1918,\nwith Husserl as director. \n\nAfter submitting his dissertation, Ingarden returned to Poland for\nthe remainder of his academic career, first teaching mathematics,\npsychology and philosophy in secondary schools while he worked on his\nHabilitationschrift. That work, published as Essentiale Fragen\nin 1925, attracted some attention in the English speaking philosophical\nworld, being reviewed twice in Mind (by A.C. Ewing in 1926 and\nby Gilbert Ryle in 1927). With the publication of his\nHabilitationschrift, Ingarden was appointed as Privatdozent at the Jan\nKazimierz University in Lwów, where he was promoted to Professor\nin 1933. During this time his most well known work, The Literary\nWork of Art, was first published (1931, in German), followed by\nThe Cognition of the Literary Work (1936, in Polish). His\nacademic career was interrupted from 1941–1944, when (due to the war)\nthe university was closed, and he secretly taught philosophy at the\nuniversity, and mathematics to secondary school children in an\norphanage. At the same time (and despite the bombing of his house in\nLwów), Ingarden was working intensively on his magnum opus\nThe Controversy over the Existence of the World (the first two\nvolumes of which were published in Polish in 1947 and 1948\nrespectively). In 1945 he moved to Jagiellonian University in\nKraków, where he was given a chair in 1946, however in 1949,\n(under Stalinization) he was banned from teaching because of his\nalleged “idealism” (ironically, a philosophical position against which\nIngarden fought for most of his life) and for being an “enemy of\nmaterialism”. The ban continued until 1957, at which point\nIngarden was reappointed to his post at Jagiellonian University, where\nhe taught until his retirement in 1963 and continued to write,\npublishing such works as The Ontology of the Work of Art\n(1962) and Experience, Artwork and Value (1969). Ingarden died\nsuddenly of a cerebral hemorrhage on June 14, 1970, while still fully\nengaged in his philosophical projects. A careful, detailed, and fully\ndocumented account of Ingarden’s biography may be found in\n[Mitscherling, 1997], which also does much to settle the\ninconsistencies in earlier partial accounts of Ingarden’s life. \n\nLike many of Husserl’s students from the Göttingen period,\nIngarden is a realist phenomenologist who ardently resisted Husserl’s\napparent turn to transcendental idealism in the Ideas and\nthereafter. Although his training is phenomenological, his work on the\nwhole is directed not towards understanding the basic structures of\nconsciousness, but rather towards ontology. Indeed, Ingarden is one of\nthe foremost practitioners of phenomenological ontology, which attempts\nto determine what the ontological structure and status of objects of\nvarious types must be, based on examining essential features of any\nexperience that could present or provide knowledge of such\nobjects—a method based in the assumption that there are essential\ncorrelations between kinds of objects and the modes of cognition by\nmeans of which they can be known. \n\nIngarden’s best-known works, indeed the only ones known to most of\nhis readers in the English-speaking world, are his works on aesthetics,\nespecially literature—works that offer unrivalledly sophisticated\nand subtle accounts both of the ontological status of works of art of\nvarious kinds, and of our means of cognizing them. His phenomenological\napproach to aesthetics strongly influenced the work of Michel\nDufrennes, and there are also strong resonances between his work on the\nontology of art and contemporary analytic work in aesthetics, e.g., by\nJoseph Margolis, Nelson Goodman and Jerrold Levinson. The Literary\nWork of Art has been particularly influential in literary studies,\nwhere its effects are visible in Wolfgang Kayser’s work Das\nsprachliche Kunstwerk and in the development of the schools of New\nCriticism and Reader Response Theory in the work of such theorists as\nRené Wellek and Wolfgang Iser, respectively. \n\nNonetheless, the frequently exclusive focus on Ingarden’s work in\naesthetics is somewhat unfortunate and can be misleading about his\noverall philosophical focus and goals. For Ingarden produced an\nenormous body of work on a wide variety of topics. He raised early and important criticisms of what he called “methodological Positivism” in a paper delivered in 1934 to the 8th World Congress of Philosophy in Prague, where Rudolf Carnap and Otto Neurath were present as respondents. There Ingarden argues that, by the positivist’s own lights, ‘metalogical’ sentences about sentences should be counted as meaningless, since sentences themselves are not mere physical objects (to be sentences they must have a certain sense), and yet the methodological Positivist accepts only sentences about the physical as intersubjectively verifiable. If on the other hand, we do consider sentences to be mere physical ‘mounds of ink’ or ‘sound waves’, then they would not be verifiable (this, he seems to be suggesting, would be something like a category mistake: how can one verify a heap of ink?). Moreover, he argues (in what Pelletier and Linsky (2018) identify as a version of the ‘Hysteron Proteron Objection’) that in order to decide whether a sentence is verifiable, one must first identify its meaning “independently of its verification”. The paper is now translated into English as “A Logical Attempt at a New Formulation of Philosophy: A Critical Remark”, and reprinted alongside the brief responses by Rudolf Carnap and Otto Neurath, and interesting contemporary discussion and evaluation by Pelletier and Linsky (2018), who suggest that Carnap never adequately responded to these criticisms.  \n\nIngarden also produced a large body of work in epistemology, ontology, metaphysics,\nphenomenology, and value theory. The relative obscurity of Ingarden’s\nwork in these other areas is attributable in part to the relative\nisolation and interruption of academic philosophy in Poland in the\nperiod of World War Two and Soviet occupation, and in part to language\nbarriers. Before the second world war, Ingarden (being German trained)\npublished his works mainly in German, thus his early works such as\nThe Literary Work of Art appeared in German early in his\ncareer, and were to have a broad impact. But during the war, Ingarden\n(in a gesture of solidarity) switched to writing in Polish, a language\nspeakers of English and other Western European languages were unlikely\nto read, and so his major works on ontology went largely unnoticed by\nthe wider European and Anglo-American philosophical circles. His major\nwork in ontology, The Controversy, for example, was not\ntranslated into German until 1964, and only in 2013 did Part 1 become\nfully available in English translation (an earlier partial translation\nwas published in 1964 as Time and Modes of Being). \n\nSeen more as a whole, Ingarden’s body of work revolves not around\naesthetics, but rather around the realism/idealism problem — an issue\nthat was to dominate his thinking ever since, as a young man, he\nrecoiled against Husserl’s transcendental idealism. As I will discuss\nin §3.1 below, Ingarden’s work in aesthetics was actually\nmotivated by his interest in the realism/idealism problem. His studies\nin fiction and the ontology of art were intended to form part of a\nlarge-scale argument against transcendental idealism, based in\nemphasizing the difference between ‘real’ entities entirely\nindependent of our minds, and social and cultural entities that (as\n‘purely intentional objects’) owe their existence, at least\nin part, to human consciousness — thus showing that, in virtue of the\nvery meanings of the ideas involved, the ‘real world’ as a\nwhole cannot be properly treated as a purely intentional object that owes\nits existence to consciousness. \n\nIn developing a positive position, Ingarden sought a middle path\nbetween the reductive physicalist realisms popular among analytic\nphilosophers, and the transcendental idealism adopted by Husserl,\nrejecting the simplistic bifurcation between entities that are\n‘mind-independent’ and those that are ‘merely\nsubjective’. His most important and lasting contribution may lie\nin providing a richer ontological framework that could track the\ndifferent ways in which many objects of the ‘life-world’ of\ndaily experience depend on human intentionality and on mind-independent\nreality, and in developing a moderate realist position that offered\nroom not only for independent physical reality and for consciousness,\nbut also for the whole variety of life-world objects that owe their\nexistence, in part, to both. \n\nMost of Ingarden’s major work focuses on ontology, which he\nconsiders a purely a priori enterprise, concerned not with\nwhat actually exists, but with what could possibly exist (which\nconcepts are non-contradictory), and with what (according to the\ncontents of the relevant ideas) it would take for objects of various\nkinds to exist, or entail if they existed. He thus contrasts ontology\nwith metaphysics, which is concerned with answering factual questions\nabout what sorts of things actually exist and what they are like.\nOntology, in Ingarden’s hands, thus bears close resemblance to the\nsorts of conceptual analysis that became common in analytic philosophy\nin roughly the same period. Ingarden’s work on the ontology of art is\nontological in this sense, e.g. he attempts to determine, by analysis\nof the essential meanings of experiences that could present something\nas a work of literature, music, or architecture, what sort of an entity\nsuch an object would have to be to satisfy those experiences and\nmeanings, and how it would have to relate to consciousness and physical\nobjects. \n\nIn his Habilitationscrhift, Essentiale Fragen (Essential Questions) from 1925 Ingarden “paves the way for his future metaphysics of the world”, such as he later develops in The Controversy over the Existence of the World (de Santis 2015). In Essential Questions, the focus is on different ways in which one may ask questions about essences. Ingarden assumes (as was characteristic in the phenomenological tradition) that there is a correlation between types of judgment and entities judged about. He thus uses the differences in the sorts of judgments that would answer the various questions as the basis for distinguishing different categories of Ideas. (For further discussion, see de Santis 2015, Ryle 1927).  \n\nDespite Ingarden’s deep admiration for Husserl, one crucial issue —\ntranscendental idealism — divided them. Indeed, Ingarden was already\n“tormented” by the problem for years before he completed\nhis dissertation [“Letter,” 422], and by 1918 had\ndefinitively determined that he could not share Husserl’s\ntranscendental idealism [Streit, vii]. Ingarden’s concern with\nand rejection of transcendental idealism directly or indirectly\ndetermined the course of much of his later philosophical work, so much\nso that in 1961 he describes his process of working on idealism as one\n“which has been in fact occupying my entire scholarly\nlife.” [“Letter,” 437]. \n\nThe transcendental idealism Ingarden rejects is the position that\nthe so-called ‘real world’ depends on consciousness for its\nexistence and essence; that it exists only for consciousness\nand beyond that is a ‘nothing’. While there is some debate\namong Husserl scholars over whether or not Husserl genuinely took the\n‘turn’ to transcendental idealism in a metaphysical sense\n(as opposed to merely treating it as if it were true while undertaking\nthe methodology of transcendental reduction), Ingarden clearly saw\nHusserl as turning from the realism of the Logical\nInvestigations to a metaphysical form of transcendental idealism\nby the time the first volume of Ideas was published, and the\ntwo frequently debated this topic in letter and in person during the\nperiod from 1918–1938. \n\nIngarden takes Husserl to have been driven to transcendental\nidealism largely by his epistemological goals and transcendental\napproach to phenomenology. If the very idea of three-dimensional\nexternal objects makes sense, it would be essential that our\nperceptions of them are inevitably inadequate: They may be presented\nfrom one point of view or another, but never exhaustively and entirely\n-- so room is always left open for new perceptions that would lead us\nto entirely revise our past judgments. Such objects thus would\ninherently transcend any finite set of experiences of them; no external\nobject could be part of any experience of it, and any judgments we\nattempt to make about them would be open to doubt. Thus if\nphenomenology is to be a ‘rigorous science’ grounded only\nin what does not go beyond our experience, it must limit its study to\nobjects of ‘immanent perception’, the meaningful series of\n(actual and possible) contents of consciousness rather than any\nsupposedly transcendent objects presented by them. Moreover, as Husserl\nargues in §41 of the Cartesian Meditations, since the\ntranscendental ego is the source of all sense, any meaning of\n‘transcendent object’ ‘outside of\nconsciousness’, etc. must be a meaning constructed through\nlayerings of the senses of our conscious acts, and transcendental\nphenomenology can analyze how these meanings are built up out of other\nmeanings of individual acts of perception and intention (e.g. ‘is\nperceived from this angle’, ‘could be perceived from\nanother angle, in these other ways’, etc.) This is the meaning\nthat the question e.g. ‘is this object real?’ may have from\nwithin the standpoint of transcendental phenomenology. Any attempt to\ngo beyond this understanding of ‘transcendent object’ or\n‘real object outside of consciousness’, however, to talk of\nsomething beyond what can be constituted by any actual or possible\nexperience is literally going beyond what can be meaningfully asked; it\nis literally non-sense. The very idea of a world outside of and\nindependent from all actual and possible experience is thus, from this\npoint of view, an illegitimate concept, a kind of disguised nonsense.\nThe only ‘real world’ of which we can legitimately speak,\nhave knowledge, or enter into other intentional relations with is the\n‘real world’ as constituted by, and essentially correlated\nwith, meaningful series’ of intentional acts. \n\nIngarden accepted that, as long as we approach the realism problem\nfrom the standpoint of epistemology, or from within the standpoint of\ntranscendental phenomenology, there is no way out to establish the\nexistence and knowledge of a mind-independent world. Nor, however, can\none establish that the real world depends on consciousness, since any\nattempted talk about the world in-itself and its nature would be\nmeaningless — thus from that standpoint, the controversy over the\nexistence of the world would have to remain undecided. But he also\nthought that other approaches to philosophy were legitimate, and indeed\nthat one should begin from ontology rather than epistemology. \n\nAccording to Ingarden, the realism/idealism problem is fundamentally\na metaphysical problem (about the actual existence of the so-called\n‘real’ world and its relation to consciousness), but may be\nnon-circularly approached via ontology by examining what the possible\nsorts of relation between consciousness and the world could be. In\nparticular, Ingarden hoped that an ontological approach to the\nrealism/idealism problem could lead to a solution by attempting to\nidentify what the possible modes of being would be of the\n‘real’ world and of consciousness, and how the two could\npossibly be related. This was the motive for his monumental work in\nontology, The Controversy over the Existence of the World,\ndesigned to describe the different possible modes of being and their\npossible interrelations, with a view to narrowing down possible\nsolutions to the realism/idealism problem. Unfortunately, the work was\nnever fully completed (although the first two volumes were published\nand the third in progress at the time of Ingarden’s death), but the\nportions that exist nonetheless contain many important and detailed\nontological analyses valuable in their own right as well as having the\npotential to contribute to the discussion of the realism/idealism\ncontroversy. Prominent among these is his distinction between formal,\nmaterial, and existential ontologies, and distinguishing ‘modes\nof being’ as highest existential categories. \n\nMost traditional category systems, such as Aristotle’s, lay out a\nsingle dimension of categories supposed to be mutually exclusive and\nexhaustive. Ingarden, by contrast, develops a multi-dimensional\ncategory scheme by dividing ontology into three parts: formal, material\nand existential ontologies, corresponding to three distinct aspects\nthat may be discerned in any entity (its formal structure, material\nnature, and mode of being respectively). These different formal,\nmaterial and existential aspects of the object, studied by the\ndifferent types of ontology, may thus be used to classify an object in\nany of three interpenetrating dimensions (although not all combinations\namong formal, material and existential modes are possible). \n\nThe formal categories are marked by such familiar ontological\ndivisions as those between objects, processes and relations. Following\nHusserl, in addition to these, Ingarden distinguishes material\ncategories, with high-level material kinds including, e.g., works of\nart and real (spatio-temporal) objects. Finally, claiming there is an\nessential ambiguity in the term ‘exists’, Ingarden also\ngoes on to distinguish different existential categories or “modes\nof being” — different ways in which entities may exist, e.g.,\ndependently or independently, in time or not, contingently or\nnecessarily, etc. \n\nThe modes of being are defined in terms of different characteristic\ncombinations of ‘existential moments’. The existential\nmoments mostly concern either an object’s temporal determinations (or\nlack thereof), or the different dependencies it bears (or does not\nbear) to other sorts of object. In investigating the existential moments that characterize a temporal mode of being, Ingarden makes original contributions to work in the ontology and phenomenology of time, arguing that the past and future exist, but in a different mode of being than the present  (for more on Ingarden’s contribution to these debates see Kobiela 2019). In drawing out the different dependencies that an entity can bear on another, Ingarden goes beyond Husserl’s influential work on dependence\nto distinguish four different existential moments of dependence (and\ntheir contrasting moments of independence): Contingency (the dependence\nof a separate entity on another in order to remain in\nexistence); Derivation (the dependence of an entity on another in order\nto come into existence); Inseparateness (the dependence of an\nentity that can only exist if it coexists with something else in a\nsingle whole); and Heteronomy (the dependence of an entity for its\nexistence and entire qualitative endowment on another). In so\ndoing, Ingarden develops one of the richest and most detailed analyses\nof dependence ever offered, providing distinctions in the notion of\ndependence that can clarify many philosophical problems including but\ncertainly not limited to the realism/idealism problem. \n\nIngarden’s four highest existential-ontological categories or\n‘modes of being’ are: Absolute, Real, Ideal, and Purely\nIntentional. The absolute mode of being could be exhibited only by a\nbeing such as God, which could exist even if nothing else whatsoever\never existed. The ideal mode of being is a timeless mode of existence\nsuitable for platonistically conceived numbers; the real mode of being\nis that of contingent spatio-temporal entities such as the realist\nassumes ordinary rocks and trees to be; while the purely intentional\nmode of being is that occupied by fictional characters and other\nentities which owe their existence and nature to acts of consciousness.\nThus the realism/idealism controversy can be reconfigured as the\ncontroversy over whether the so-called ‘real world’ has the\nreal or purely intentional mode of being. (For further discussion of the Purely Intentional mode of being and its role in the theory of perception, see Chrudzimski 2015 and Uemura 2019) \n\nBy far Ingarden’s best-known and most influential work, especially\nin the English-speaking world, is The Literary Work of Art,\nwhich was written around 1926, and first published in German in 1931.\nIt is fundamentally a work in ontology, in Ingarden’s sense (see\n§2 above), laying out the essential features anything must have to\nbe counted as a literary work, what parts it must have and how they are\ninterrelated, and how such entities as literary works relate to other\nsorts of entities such as authors, copies of texts, readers, and ideal\nmeanings. \n\nAs with so much of Ingarden’s philosophical work, he undertakes this\nstudy of the ontology of the literary work in part with the motive of\nutilizing its results to argue against transcendental idealism —\nindeed he conceived of The Literary Work of Art as a\npreliminary study for The Controversy. Literary works and the\ncharacters and objects represented in them were to provide examples of\npurely intentional objects — objects owing their existence and essence\nto consciousness. Thus a detailed study of works of literature and\ntheir represented objects could serve to explicate the purely\nintentional mode of being, with a view to contrasting this with the\nreal mode of being and ultimately demonstrating that it is impossible\nto reduce the ‘real world’ to the status of a purely\nintentional creation. [Streit, vii-viii]. Nonetheless, this\nmotive remains largely behind the scenes of the detailed studies of\nlanguage and literature in The Literary Work of Art, which can\nbe (and largely has been) described and evaluated without reference to\nthese broader motives, as an independent contribution to aesthetics and\nliterary theory. \n\nThe work begins by attempting to determine the ‘mode of\nexistence’ of the literary work — essentially the same problem\nthat today goes under the heading of understanding the ontological\nstatus of works of literature, music, etc. In twelve concise pages, he\nprovides compelling reasons to reject both attempts to identify\nliterary works with “real” objects or events such as copies\nof texts or the psychological experiences of authors or readers, and\nattempts to identify them with platonistic “ideal” objects\nsuch as ordered manifolds of sentences or meanings. Each such attempted\nidentification leads to various absurdities, e.g. the view literary\nworks are physical objects would lead us to say that such works differ\nby chemical composition; the view that they are experiences of the\nauthor would make them completely unknowable, while the view that they\nare experiences of readers would prevent us from postulating a single\nwork Hamlet known by many readers; and the view that they are\nideal objects would entail that literary works may never be created and\ncannot be changed, even by their authors. \n\nAs a result, works of literature cannot be classified in either of\nthe major categories of objects accepted by traditional metaphysics —\nneither the categories of the real nor the ideal are suited for them.\nAny acceptable ontology of literature thus must accept entities of\nanother category. As Ingarden ultimately argues towards the close of\nthe text, the literary work is a “purely intentional\nformation,” derived from the sentence-forming activities of its\nauthor(s), and founded on some public copy of these sentences, and also\ndepending for its existence and essence on a relation to certain ideal\nmeanings attached to the words of the text. \n\nWhile the question of the ontological status of the literary work\nforms the work’s beginning, most of the details of the text are\ndedicated to drawing out an “essential anatomy” of the\nliterary work, determining its essential parts and their relations to\none another. Ingarden conceives of this task as preliminary to any questions\nof the values that works of literature may or may not have, as we will\nbe better able to see where values of different types can inhere once\nwe know what the different parts of the literary work are. \n\nAccording to Ingarden, every literary work is composed of four\nheterogeneous strata: \n\nEach of these strata has room for its own typical sorts of aesthetic\nvalue (or disvalue); thus we may distinguish the values of rhythm,\nalliteration, or mellifluousness at the level of word sounds, from the\nvalues in interesting (or jarring) juxtapositions of ideas and concepts\nat the level of meaning units, from the quasi-visual splendor of the\nscene presented, from the values of sympathetic or complex characters\nand intricate plots. \n\nThe values of a literary work, however, are not exhausted by the\nseparate values of its several strata, for the strata do not exist\nseparately, but rather form an ‘organic unity’. Among the\nstrata are various forms of mutual dependence and influence, and the\nharmonies or disharmonies among the strata (e.g. between the halting\nrhythms of a character’s speech and his timid personality) may\ncontribute other aesthetic merits or demerits to the work. Most\nimportantly, in cooperation with the other strata, the stratum of\nrepresented objects may present “metaphysical qualities”\nsuch as the tragic, the dreadful, the peaceful and so on, which\ncharacterize true works of art. The work of literature as a whole,\nthus, is a “polyphonic harmony,” much like a piece of\npolyphonic music in which each singer’s voice may lend aesthetic\nqualities of its own to the value of the whole, while the greatest\nvalues of the work as a whole may lie in the intricate interrelations\namong the values of all of the individual elements. \n\nA stratified theory like Ingarden’s has considerable strengths. It\nprovides a framework within which we can offer detailed analyses of\nliterary works identifying their many sorts of value or disvalue,\nrather than simply passing judgment on the whole. As a result, many\napparent conflicts in judgments of taste may be resolved without\nembracing subjectivism, by noting that the individuals concerned may be\npassing judgment on different strata of the literary work. It also\nenables us to understand stylistic differences among authors and over\ntime as differences in which strata are emphasized and which\nde-emphasized, e.g. as many modernist works de-emphasize the\ntraditionally foregrounded stratum of represented objects in favor of\njuxtaposed images at the level of schematized aspects (e.g. Virginia\nWoolf’s The Waves), or even background both of these to the\nrhythms and sound patterns at the level of phonetic formations (e.g.\nEdith Sitwell’s nonsense poetry). Yet we can do so without seeing such\nchanges as forming a radical break or undermining the idea that these\nare all part of a continuous literary tradition. \n\nIn 1928, immediately after writing The Literary Work of\nArt, Ingarden expanded his analyses of the ontology of art from\nliterature, to also discuss music, painting, and architecture in a\nseries of essays originally intended as an appendix to The Literary\nWork of Art. As it happened, however, the appendix was not\npublished along with The Literary Work of Art, and remained\ndormant until after the war, when (in 1946) essays on the picture and\nthe architectural work were published in Polish. The three studies were\nexpanded and finally published in German in 1961, along with an article\non film, and were not translated into English until 1989. The late date\nof their release and the fact that they remain little known is a great\nshame, as they address many of the same ontological issues as those\ndebated in ‘analytic’ aesthetics, and provide not only\ncompelling arguments against many popular positions but also analyses\nof the ontological structure of works of various kinds unsurpassed in\nsubtlety and detail. \n\nThe first three essays of The Ontology of the Work of Art,\n“The Musical Work,” “The Picture,” and\n“The Architectural Work” each attempt to determine the\nontological status of the work of art in question, its relation to\nconcrete entities such as copies of the score, sound events, painted\ncanvasses or buildings, as well as to creative acts of artists and the\nconscious states of viewers. Each also examines whether and to what\nextent the form of art in question, like the literary work, may turn\nout to have a stratified structure. \n\nThe musical work, Ingarden argues, is distinct from experiences of\nits composer and listeners, and cannot be identified with any\nindividual sound event, performance or copy of the score. But nor can\nit be classified among ideal entities, since it is created by a\ncomposer at a certain time, not merely discovered [Ontology,\n4–5]. It thus apparently falls between categories such as the\n‘real’ and the ‘ideal’, and so accepting the\nexistence of musical works (like literary works) seems to require us to\naccept the existence of things in a category distinct from either of\nthose — that of purely intentional objects. The musical work is a\npurely intentional object with its ‘source of being in the\ncreative acts of the composer and its ontic foundation in the\nscore’ [Ontology, 91]. In itself, a traditionally scored\nwork of Western music is a schematic formation full of places of\nindeterminacy (e.g. it may be indeterminate exactly how loudly a note\nis to be played, or how long it should be held), which are filled out\ndifferently in various performances. Unlike the literary work, however,\nthe work of music is not a stratified entity, there being no essential\nrepresenting function of the sounds of the musical work (unlike the\nsounds of a novel). \n\nThe picture, too, is a purely intentional object, created by an\nartist and founded both in a real painting (a paint-covered canvas),\nand in the viewer’s operations of apprehending it. The picture as a\nwork of art cannot be identified with the real paint-covered canvas\nhanging in a gallery, for the two have different properties and\ndifferent modes of cognitive accessibility. The picture can only be\nseen, and indeed only seen from certain points of view; the painting,\nby contrast, can be seen, smelled, heard, or even tasted, and can be\nobserved from any point of view. Ingarden also holds that the picture\nas such (unlike the painting) is not an individual object of any sort\n-- one and the same picture may be presented in many paintings (if they\nare all perfect copies of an original). (It might be worth noting that\nwhile this is plausible enough for the picture, considered as such, we\ndo typically treat works of visual art as one-off individual objects\n(distinct from perfect copies or forgeries).) Moreover, the picture, to\nbe seen, requires that viewers take up a certain cognitive attitude\nregarding it, not required to observe the painting. \n\n“The Architectural Work” is perhaps the most interesting\nof the three major essays in the Ontology of the Work of Art,\nfor it suggests how Ingarden’s examination of works of art may be\nbroadened out to form the framework for a general theory of social and\ncultural objects and their relations to the more basic physical objects\nposited by the natural sciences. The architectural work might seem to\npose the crucial objection to Ingarden’s view that works of art are\n‘purely intentional objects’ having at least a\nfoundation of their existence in the intentional states of their makers\nand viewers: “After all, the Notre Dame of Paris appears to be no\nless real than the many residential buildings that stand in its\nvicinity, than the island upon which it was built, the river that flows\nnearby, and so on” [255]. Nonetheless, even in this case,\nIngarden argues, the architectural work is not a mere independent\n‘real’ object, although it is founded on one (the\n‘heap of stones’ forming its physical basis). For its\nexistence as an architectural work requires not only its creation by an\narchitect (rather than its coming into existence as a mere natural\nformation), but also requires the ‘reconstructive acts of the\nviewer’ taking up a certain attitude towards the real object and\nhelping co-constitute its aesthetic and even its sensible properties.\nThe work of architecture is thus a doubly founded object, which\n“refers back not only to the creative acts of the architect and\nthe reconstructive acts of the viewer, but also to its ontic foundation\nin a fully determined real thing shaped in a particular way”\n[Ontology, 263]. \n\n(The fact that even such purely intentional objects as works of art\nof various kinds are founded not exclusively in consciousness, but also\n(in various ways) on real spatio-temporal objects, is also an important\npart of Ingarden’s arguments against idealism, suggesting that even if\nthe proper mode of being for the world of experience was\npurely intentional being, that still would not be sufficient to show\nthat all that exists is a pure product of consciousness.) \n\nThis situation for architecture parallels that for a great many of\nthe social and cultural objects of our everyday experience in what\nHusserl called the ‘life-world’. As Ingarden emphasizes, a\nflag, for example, should not be identified with the mere piece of\ncloth of which it is fashioned, for it has different essential\nproperties, and has an additional foundation in the mental acts of the\ncommunity that accept it as a flag and endow it with meanings and embed\nit in norms of action (e.g. we are not to clean pots with it but to use\nit in rendering military honors). Similarly, a church is not identical\nwith the real building on which it is founded, but rather is created\nonly through acts of consecration and the preservation of appropriate\nattitudes in the relevant community. In virtue of its secondary\ndependence on acts of consciousness, the church is endowed with various\n(social and cultural) properties and functions that a mere ordered heap\nof building materials cannot have. In this way Ingarden provides the\nbasis for an account of the nature of cultural and social objects that\ntakes neither the reductionist route of identifying them with their\nphysical bases, nor the subjectivist route of treating all objects as\nmere social constructions. The life-world takes its unique place as the\ncommon product of acts of consciousness and an independent real world,\nand its existence (in quite specific ways) presupposes that of both of\nthose foundations. \n\nIn addition to his work on the ontology of art objects of various\nkinds, Ingarden also undertook general work on the ontological status\nof the aesthetic object and the nature of aesthetic values, as well as phenomenological work on the experience of works of art of various kinds. On the\nobject side, as we have seen he distinguishes in each case between the\nmere physical object and the work of art; but he also distinguishes\nboth of these from what he calls the “concretization”\n(sometimes translated as “concretion”) of the work of art,\nwhich he considers to be the true ‘aesthetic object’. The\nwork of art itself, in the case of most forms of art such as\nliterature, painting, or music, is what Ingarden calls a\n“schematic formation.” That is, it has certain\n‘places of indeterminacy’, many of which are filled in by\nan individual interpretation or ‘reading’ of the work. Thus\nin the case of literature, there are many places of indeterminacy at\nthe level of character and plot — unlike in the case of real people,\nit is often simply indeterminate what a literary character had for\nbreakfast, how far she sat back from the table, what the table was made\nof, etc. Such indeterminacies are generally partially filled in by the\nreader in reconstructing the work, as the reader’s background\nassumptions help (at least partially) flesh out the skeletal imaginary\nscene directly presented by the words of the text. Similarly, a\nrepresentational painting generally leaves indeterminate, e.g., what\nthe back of the person’s head looks like in the case of a portrait,\nwhat they are thinking, or what happens immediately before or after the\nmoment visually represented in paintings of historical events. Yet\nagain, viewers’ reconstructive acts typically supplement these\nindeterminacies in various ways, e.g. automatically grasping the lower\nright corner of Breugel’s ‘Fall of Icarus’ as presenting\nthe moment between a fall from the sky and the complete disappearance\nof the body under water (not, e.g., as presenting an attempt at an\nunderwater handstand). Finally, in the case of music, a score leaves\nindeterminate various elements such as the precise timbre and fullness\nof tone, and these are filled out in different ways in different\nperformances of the work. In each case, (at least partially) filling in\nthe indeterminacies of the work through a reading, performance, or\nviewing renders the work more ‘concrete’. Each work of art\npermits of a variety of legitimate concretizations which, unlike the\nwork of art itself, may vary from viewer to viewer. If the concretion\noccurs within the aesthetic attitude, an aesthetic object is formed\n[Selected Papers, 93], and so many aesthetic objects may be\nbased on one and the same work of art. \n\nCorresponding to this three-fold distinction between physical\nobject, work of art, and aesthetic object, Ingarden posits a three-fold\ndistinction among properties. While the mere physical object possesses\nonly value-neutral physical properties, the work of art may possess\nboth ‘axiologically neutral’ properties such as having a\ncertain sentence structure or bearing patches of color arranged in\ncertain ways, and artistic value qualities founded on these, such as\nclarity or obscurity of expression, technical mastery in the way the\nmaterials are worked, balance of composition, etc. Aesthetic values\nsuch as serenity, sublimity, profundity, etc., though they exist\n‘potentially’ in the work of art, only manifest themselves\nin the aesthetic objects created through concretizing the work of art,\nand characterize the aesthetic object as a whole, although their\nappearance may depend on that of many particular properties of the work\nof art and physical object. Since various aesthetic objects may be\nbased on one and the same work of art, these may also differ in their\naesthetic values. This can, at least in part, help account for the\nvariety of aesthetic judgments that may be formed apparently concerning\nthe same work of art. \n\nYet as usual, Ingarden is concerned to account for the role of\nconsciousness in constituting aesthetic values and the variations in\naesthetic judgments without embracing a subjectivism that would deny\nthat there is any better or worse in aesthetic judgment, each being a\nmere report of the pleasure experienced by the one judging. Such\nsubjectivism is to be avoided by noting first, that some\nconcretizations are better suited to the work’s demands than others,\nmore faithful, or better able to bring out the potential values in the\nwork. A careful interpreter and evaluator can, through repeated contact\nwith the work, come increasingly close to separating out idiosyncratic\nelements of her interpretations from what is proper to the work.\nSecondly, the aesthetic properties of the resulting concretization are\nnot arbitrary inventions of the viewer, nor are they based on the\npleasure she derives from the experience. Instead, their appearance\nsimply requires a competent viewer to observe the work’s neutral and\nartistic values in an aesthetic attitude. Thus here, as elsewhere,\nIngarden’s goal is ultimately to account for the legitimate role of\nconsciousness in constituting many of the objects and properties\nexperienced by us, while also avoiding a pure subjectivism or universal\nsocial constructivism by acknowledging the role of an independent\n‘real’ world in founding the cultural objects and value\nproperties we so often concern ourselves with in daily life. \nIn addition to his work on the ontology of works of art and their values, Ingarden also engaged in directly phenomenological investigations into the nature of our experience of works of art of various kinds. For example, he examines our experience of literature in The Cognition of the Literary Work of Art, of music in The Work of Music and the Problem of its Identity, and of aesthetic experience more generally (including experience of sculpture) in “Aesthetic Experience and Aesthetic Object”. In each case he is concerned not only to offer a detailed analysis of the development of the relevant aesthetic experience (including its development over time), but also to contrast such aesthetic experiences with cases of ordinary sense perception, undertaken in what he calls a ’practical’ or an ‘investigating attitude’ (1961, 295). \n\n Thanks to Ira Richardson for research assistance with the 2020 updated version of this entry.\n","contact.mail":"amie.l.thomasson@dartmouth.edu","contact.domain":"dartmouth.edu"}]
