Realism, also known as\npolitical realism, is a view of international politics that stresses\nits competitive and conflictual side. It is usually contrasted with\nidealism or liberalism, which tends to emphasize cooperation. Realists\nconsider the principal actors in the international arena to be states,\nwhich are concerned with their own security, act in pursuit of their\nown national interests, and struggle for power. The negative side of\nthe realists’ emphasis on power and self-interest is often their\nskepticism regarding the relevance of ethical norms to relations among\nstates. National politics is the realm of authority and law, whereas\ninternational politics, they sometimes claim, is a sphere without\njustice, characterized by active or potential conflict among\nstates.\n\n\n\nNot all realists, however, deny the presence of ethics in\ninternational relations. The distinction should be drawn between\nclassical realism—represented by such twentieth-century theorists\nas Reinhold Niebuhr and Hans Morgenthau—and radical or extreme\nrealism. While classical realism emphasizes the concept of national\ninterest, it is not the Machiavellian doctrine “that anything is\njustified by reason of state” (Bull 1995, 189). Nor does it\ninvolve the glorification of war or conflict. The classical realists do\nnot reject the possibility of moral judgment in international politics.\nRather, they are critical of moralism—abstract moral discourse\nthat does not take into account political realities. They assign\nsupreme value to successful political action based on prudence: the\nability to judge the rightness of a given action from among possible\nalternatives on the basis of its likely political consequences.\n\n\n\nRealism encompasses a variety of approaches and claims a long\ntheoretical tradition. Among its founding fathers, Thucydides,\nMachiavelli and Hobbes are the names most usually mentioned.\nTwentieth-century classical realism has today been largely replaced by\nneorealism, which is an attempt to construct a more scientific approach\nto the study of international relations. Both classical realism and\nneorealism have been subjected to criticism from IR theorists\nrepresenting liberal, critical, and post-modern perspectives.\n\n\n\nLike other classical political theorists, Thucydides\n(c. 460–c. 400 B.C.E.)  saw politics as involving moral\nquestions. Most importantly, he asks whether relations among states to\nwhich power is crucial can also be guided by the norms of\njustice. His History of the Peloponnesian War is in fact\nneither a work of political philosophy nor a sustained theory of\ninternational relations. Much of this work, which presents a partial\naccount of the armed conflict between Athens and Sparta that took\nplace from 431 to 404 B.C.E., consists of paired speeches by\npersonages who argue opposing sides of an issue.  Nevertheless, if\nthe History is described as the only acknowledged classical\ntext in international relations, and if it inspires theorists from\nHobbes to contemporary international relations scholars, this is\nbecause it is more than a chronicle of events, and a theoretical\nposition can be extrapolated from it. Realism is expressed in the very\nfirst speech of the Athenians recorded in the\nHistory—a speech given at the debate that took place in\nSparta just before the war. Moreover, a realist perspective is implied\nin the way Thucydides explains the cause of the Peloponnesian War, and\nalso in the famous “Melian Dialogue,” in the statements\nmade by the Athenian envoys. \n\nInternational relations realists emphasize the constraints imposed\non politics by the nature of human beings, whom they consider egoistic,\nand by the absence of international government. Together these factors\ncontribute to a conflict-based paradigm of international relations, in\nwhich the key actors are states, in which power and security become the\nmain issues, and in which there is little place for morality. The set\nof premises concerning state actors, egoism, anarchy, power, security,\nand morality that define the realist tradition are all present in\nThucydides. \n\n(1) Human nature is a starting point for classical political realism. Realists view human beings as inherently egoistic and self-interested to the extent that self-interest overcomes moral\nprinciples. At the debate in Sparta, described in Book I of\nThucydides’ History, the Athenians affirm the priority\nof self-interest over morality. They say that considerations of right\nand wrong have “never turned people aside from the opportunities\nof aggrandizement offered by superior strength” (chap. 1 par.\n76). \n\n(2) Realists, and especially today’s neorealists, consider the\nabsence of government, literally anarchy, to be the primary\ndeterminant of international political outcomes. The lack of a common\nrule-making and enforcing authority means, they argue, that the\ninternational arena is essentially a self-help system. Each state is\nresponsible for its own survival and is free to define its own\ninterests and to pursue power. Anarchy thus leads to a situation in\nwhich power has the overriding role in shaping interstate relations. In\nthe words of the Athenian envoys at Melos, without any common authority\nthat can enforce order, “the independent states survive [only]\nwhen they are powerful” (5.97). \n\n(3) Insofar as realists envision the world of states as anarchic,\nthey likewise view security as a central issue. To attain security,\nstates try to increase their power and engage in power-balancing for\nthe purpose of deterring potential aggressors. Wars are fought to\nprevent competing nations from becoming militarily stronger.\nThucydides, while distinguishing between the immediate and underlying\ncauses of the Peloponnesian War, does not see its real cause in any of\nthe particular events that immediately preceded its outbreak. He\ninstead locates the cause of the war in the changing distribution of\npower between the two blocs of Greek city-states: the Delian League,\nunder the leadership of Athens, and the Peloponnesian League, under the\nleadership of Sparta. According to him, the growth of Athenian power\nmade the Spartans afraid for their security, and thus propelled them\ninto war (1.23). \n\n(4) Realists are generally skeptical about the relevance of morality\nto international politics. This can lead them to claim that there is no\nplace for morality in international relations, or that there is a\ntension between demands of morality and requirements of successful\npolitical action, or that states have their own morality that is\ndifferent from customary morality, or that morality, if employed at all, is merely\nused instrumentally to justify states’ conduct. A clear case of\nthe rejection of ethical norms in relations among states can be found\nin the “Melian Dialogue” (5.85–113). This dialogue relates\nto the events of 416 B.C.E., when Athens invaded the island of Melos. The\nAthenian envoys presented the Melians with a choice, destruction or\nsurrender, and from the outset asked them not to appeal to justice, but\nto think only about their survival. In the envoys’ words,\n“We both know that the decisions about justice are made in human\ndiscussions only when both sides are under equal compulsion, but when\none side is stronger, it gets as much as it can, and the weak must\naccept that” (5.89). To be “under equal compulsion”\nmeans to be under the force of law, and thus to be subjected to a\ncommon lawgiving authority (Korab-Karpowicz 2006, 234). Since such an\nauthority above states does not exist, the Athenians argue that in this\nlawless condition of international anarchy, the only right is the right\nof the stronger to dominate the weaker. They explicitly equate right\nwith might, and exclude considerations of justice from foreign\naffairs. \n\nWe can thus find strong support for a realist perspective in the\nstatements of the Athenians. The question remains, however, to what\nextent their realism coincides with Thucydides’ own viewpoint.\nAlthough substantial passages of the “Melian Dialogue,” as\nwell as other parts of the History support a realistic\nreading, Thucydides’ position cannot be deduced from such\nselected fragments, but rather must be assessed on the basis of the\nwider context of his book. In fact, even the “Melian\nDialogue” itself provides us with a number of contending\nviews. \n\nPolitical realism is usually contrasted by IR scholars with idealism\nor liberalism, a theoretical perspective that emphasizes international\nnorms, interdependence among states, and international cooperation. The\n“Melian Dialogue,” which is one of the most frequently\ncommented-upon parts of Thucydides’ History, presents\nthe classic debate between the idealist and realist views: Can\ninternational politics be based on a moral order derived from the\nprinciples of justice, or will it forever remain the arena of\nconflicting national interests and power? \n\nFor the Melians, who employ idealistic arguments, the choice is\nbetween war and subjection (5.86). They are courageous and love their\ncountry. They do not wish to lose their freedom, and in spite of the\nfact that they are militarily weaker than the Athenians, they are\nprepared to defend themselves (5.100; 5.112). They base their arguments\non an appeal to justice, which they associate with fairness, and regard\nthe Athenians as unjust (5.90; 5.104). They are pious, believing that\ngods will support their just cause and compensate for their weakness,\nand trust in alliances, thinking that their allies, the Spartans, who\nare also related to them, will help them (5.104; 5.112). Hence, one can\nidentify in the speech of the Melians elements of the idealistic or\nliberal world view: the belief that nations have the right to exercise\npolitical independence, that they have mutual obligations to one\nanother and will carry out such obligations, and that a war of\naggression is unjust. What the Melians nevertheless lack are resources\nand foresight. In their decision to defend themselves, they are guided\nmore by their hopes than by the evidence at hand or by prudent\ncalculations. \n\nThe Athenian argument is based on key realist concepts such as\nsecurity and power, and is informed not by what the world should be,\nbut by what it is. The Athenians disregard any moral talk and urge the\nMelians to look at the facts—that is, to recognize their military\ninferiority, to consider the potential consequences of their decision,\nand to think about their own survival (5.87; 5.101). There appears to\nbe a powerful realist logic behind the Athenian arguments. Their\nposition, based on security concerns and self-interest, seemingly\ninvolves reliance on rationality, intelligence, and foresight. However,\nupon close examination, their logic proves to be seriously flawed.\nMelos, a relatively weak state, does not pose any real security threat\nto them. The eventual destruction of Melos does not change the course\nof the Peloponnesian War, which Athens will lose a few years later. \n\nIn the History, Thucydides shows that power, if it is\nunrestrained by moderation and a sense of justice, brings about the\nuncontrolled desire for more power. There are no logical limits to the\nsize of an empire. Drunk with the prospect of glory and gain, after\nconquering Melos, the Athenians engage in a war against Sicily. They\npay no attention to the Melian argument that considerations of justice\nare useful to all in the longer run (5.90). And, as the Athenians\noverestimate their strength and in the end lose the war, their\nself-interested logic proves to be very shortsighted indeed. \n\nIt is utopian to ignore the reality of power in international\nrelations, but it is equally blind to rely on power alone. Thucydides\nappears to support neither the naive idealism of the Melians nor the\ncynicism of their Athenian opponents. He teaches us to be on guard\n“against naïve-dreaming on international politics,”\non the one hand, and “against the other pernicious extreme:\nunrestrained cynicism,” on the other (Donnelly 2000, 193). If he\ncan be regarded as a political realist, his realism nonetheless prefigures neither realpolitik, in which traditional\nethics is denied, nor today’s scientific neorealism, in which moral\nquestions are largely ignored. Thucydides’ realism, neither immoral\nnor amoral, can rather be compared to that of Hans Morgenthau, Raymond\nAron, and other twentieth-century classical realists, who, although\nsensible to the demands of national interest, would not deny that\npolitical actors on the international scene are subject to moral\njudgment.\n\n \n\nIdealism in international relations, like realism, can lay claim to\na long tradition. Unsatisfied with the world as they have found it,\nidealists have always tried to answer the question of “what ought\nto be” in politics. Plato, Aristotle, and Cicero were all\npolitical idealists who believed that there were some universal moral\nvalues on which political life could be based. Building on the work of\nhis predecessors, Cicero developed the idea of a natural moral law that\nwas applicable to both domestic and international politics. His ideas\nconcerning righteousness in war were carried further in the writings of\nthe Christian thinkers St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas. In the\nlate fifteenth century, when Niccolò Machiavelli was born, the\nidea that politics, including the relations among states, should be\nvirtuous, and that the methods of warfare should remain subordinated to\nethical standards, still predominated in political literature. \n\nMachiavelli (1469–1527) challenged this well-established moral\ntradition, thus positioning himself as a political innovator. The\nnovelty of his approach lies in his critique of classical Western\npolitical thought as unrealistic, and in his separation of politics\nfrom ethics. He thereby lays the foundations for modern politics. In\nchapter XV of The Prince, Machiavelli announces that in\ndeparting from the teachings of earlier thinkers, he seeks “the\neffectual truth of the matter rather than the imagined one.” The\n“effectual truth” is for him the only truth worth seeking.\nIt represents the sum of the practical conditions that he believes are\nrequired to make both the individual and the country prosperous and\nstrong. Machiavelli replaces the ancient virtue (a moral\nquality of the individual, such as justice or self-restraint) with\nvirtù, ability or vigor. As a prophet of\nvirtù, he promises to lead both nations and individuals\nto earthly glory and power. \n\nMachiavellianism is a radical type of political realism\nthat is applied to both domestic and international affairs. It is a\ndoctrine which denies the relevance of morality in politics, and claims\nthat all means (moral and immoral) are justified to achieve certain\npolitical ends. Although Machiavelli never uses the phrase ragione\ndi stato or its French equivalent, raison\nd’état, what ultimately counts for him is precisely\nthat: whatever is good for the state, rather than ethical scruples or\nnorms \n\nMachiavelli justified immoral actions in politics, but never refused\nto admit that they are evil. He operated within the single framework of\ntraditional morality. It became a specific task of his\nnineteenth-century followers to develop the doctrine of a double\nethics: one public and one private, to push Machiavellian realism to\neven further extremes, and to apply it to international relations. By\nasserting that “the state has no higher duty than of maintaining\nitself,” Hegel gave an ethical sanction to the state’s\npromotion of its own interest and advantage against other states\n(Meinecke 357). Thus he overturned the traditional morality. The good\nof the state was perversely interpreted as the highest moral value,\nwith the extension of national power regarded as a nation’s right\nand duty. Referring to Machiavelli, Heinrich von Treitschke declared\nthat the state was power, precisely in order to assert itself as\nagainst other equally independent powers, and that the supreme moral\nduty of the state was to foster this power. He considered international\nagreements to be binding only insofar as it was expedient for the\nstate. The idea of an autonomous ethics of state behavior and the\nconcept of realpolitik were thus introduced. Traditional\nethics was denied and power politics was associated with a\n“higher” type of morality. These concepts, along with the\nbelief in the superiority of Germanic culture, served as weapons with\nwhich German statesmen, from the eighteenth century to the end of the\nSecond World War, justified their policies of conquest and\nextermination. \n\nMachiavelli is often praised for his prudential advice to\nleaders (which has caused him to be regarded as a founding master of\nmodern political strategy) and for his defense of the republican form\nof government. There are certainly many aspects of his thought that\nmerit such praise. Nevertheless, it is also possible to see him as the\nthinker who bears foremost responsibility for the demoralization of Europe.\nThe argument of the Athenian envoys presented in Thucydides’\n“Melian Dialogue,” that of Thrasymachus in Plato’s\nRepublic, or that of Carneades, to whom Cicero\nrefers—all of these challenge the ancient and Christian views of\nthe unity of politics and ethics. However, before Machiavelli, this\namoral or immoral mode of thinking had never prevailed in the\nmainstream of Western political thought. It was the force and\ntimeliness of his justification of resorting to evil as a legitimate\nmeans of achieving political ends that persuaded so many of the\nthinkers and political practitioners who followed him. The effects of\nMachiavellian ideas, such as the notion that the employment of all\npossible means was permissible in war, would be seen on the\nbattlefields of modern Europe, as mass citizen armies fought against\neach other to the bitter end without regard for the rules of justice.\nThe tension between expediency and morality lost its validity in the\nsphere of politics. The concept of a double ethics, private and public,\nthat created a further damage to traditional, customary ethics was\ninvented. The doctrine of raison d’état\nultimately led to the politics of Lebensraum, two world wars,\nand the Holocaust. \n\nPerhaps the greatest problem with realism in international\nrelations is that it has a tendency to slip into its extreme version,\nwhich accepts any policy that can benefit the state at the expense of\nother states, no matter how morally problematic the policy is. Even if\nthey do not explicitly raise ethical questions, in the works of Waltz\nand of many other of today’s neorealists, a double ethics is\npresupposed, and words such realpolitik no longer have the\nnegative connotations that they had for classical realists, such as\nHans Morgenthau. \n\nThomas Hobbes (1588–1683) was part of an intellectual movement whose\ngoal was to free the emerging modern science from the constraints of\nthe classical and scholastic heritage. According to classical political\nphilosophy, on which the idealist perspective is based, human beings\ncan control their desires through reason and can work for the benefit\nof others, even at the expense of their own benefit. They are thus both\nrational and moral agents, capable of distinguishing between right and\nwrong, and of making moral choices. They are also naturally social.\nWith great skill Hobbes attacks these views. His human beings,\nextremely individualistic rather than moral or social, are subject to\n“a perpetual and restless desire of power after power, that\nceases only in death” (Leviathan XI 2). They therefore\ninevitably struggle for power. In setting out such ideas, Hobbes\ncontributes to some of the basic conceptions fundamental to the realist\ntradition in international relations, and especially to neorealism.\nThese include the characterization of human nature as egoistic, the\nconcept of international anarchy, and the view that politics, rooted in\nthe struggle for power, can be rationalized and studied\nscientifically. \n\nOne of the most widely known Hobbesian concepts is that of the\nanarchic state of nature, seen as entailing a state of war—and\n“such a war as is of every man against every man” (XII 8).\nHe derives his notion of the state of war from his views of both human\nnature and the condition in which individuals exist. Since in the state\nof nature there is no government and everyone enjoys equal status,\nevery individual has a right to everything; that is, there are no\nconstraints on an individual’s behavior. Anyone may at any time\nuse force, and all must constantly be ready to counter such force with\nforce. Hence, driven by acquisitiveness, having no moral restraints,\nand motivated to compete for scarce goods, individuals are apt to\n“invade” one another for gain. Being suspicious of one\nanother and driven by fear, they are also likely to engage in\npreemptive actions and invade one another to ensure their own safety.\nFinally, individuals are also driven by pride and a desire for glory.\nWhether for gain, safety, or reputation, power-seeking individuals will\nthus “endeavor to destroy or subdue one another” (XIII 3).\nIn such uncertain conditions where everyone is a potential aggressor,\nmaking war on others is a more advantageous strategy than peaceable\nbehavior, and one needs to learn that domination over others is\nnecessary for one’s own continued survival. \n\nHobbes is primarily concerned with the relationship between\nindividuals and the state, and his comments about relations among\nstates are scarce. Nevertheless, what he says about the lives of\nindividuals in the state of nature can also be interpreted as a\ndescription of how states exist in relation to one another. Once states\nare established, the individual drive for power becomes the basis for\nthe states’ behavior, which often manifests itself in their\nefforts to dominate other states and peoples. States, “for their\nown security,” writes Hobbes, “enlarge their dominions upon\nall pretences of danger and fear of invasion or assistance that may be\ngiven to invaders, [and] endeavour as much as they can, to subdue and\nweaken their neighbors” (XIX 4). Accordingly, the quest and\nstruggle for power lies at the core of the Hobbesian vision of\nrelations among states. The same would later be true of the model of\ninternational relations developed by Hans Morgenthau, who was deeply\ninfluenced by Hobbes and adopted the same view of human nature.\nSimilarly, the neorealist Kenneth Waltz would follow Hobbes’ lead\nregarding international anarchy (the fact that sovereign states are not\nsubject to any higher common sovereign) as the essential element of\ninternational relations. \n\nBy subjecting themselves to a sovereign, individuals escape the war\nof all against all which Hobbes associates with the state of nature;\nhowever, this war continues to dominate relations among states. This\ndoes not mean that states are always fighting, but rather that they\nhave a disposition to fight (XIII 8). With each state deciding for\nitself whether or not to use force, war may break out at any time. The\nachievement of domestic security through the creation of a state is\nthen paralleled by a condition of inter-state insecurity. One can argue\nthat if Hobbes were fully consistent, he would agree with the notion\nthat, to escape this condition, states should also enter into a\ncontract and submit themselves to a world sovereign. Although the idea\nof a world state would find support among some of today’s\nrealists, this is not a position taken by Hobbes himself. He does not\npropose that a social contract among nations be implemented to bring\ninternational anarchy to an end. This is because the condition of\ninsecurity in which states are placed does not necessarily lead to\ninsecurity for their citizens. As long as an armed conflict or other type\nof hostility between states does not actually break out, individuals\nwithin a state can feel relatively secure. \n\nThe denial of the existence of universal moral principles in the\nrelations among states brings Hobbes close to the Machiavellians and\nthe followers of the doctrine of raison d’état.\nHis theory of international relations, which assumes that independent\nstates, like independent individuals, are enemies by nature, asocial\nand selfish, and that there is no moral limitation on their behavior,\nis a great challenge to the idealist political vision based on human\nsociability and to the concept of the international jurisprudence that\nis built on this vision. However, what separates Hobbes from\nMachiavelli and associates him more with classical realism is his\ninsistence on the defensive character of foreign policy. His political\ntheory does not put forward the invitation to do whatever may be\nadvantageous for the state. His approach to international relations is\nprudential and pacific: sovereign states, like individuals, should be\ndisposed towards peace which is commended by reason. \n\nWhat Waltz and other neorealist readers of Hobbes’s works\nsometimes overlook is that he does not perceive international anarchy\nas an environment without any rules. By suggesting that certain\ndictates of reason apply even in the state of nature, he affirms that\nmore peaceful and cooperative international relations are possible.\nNeither does he deny the existence of international law. Sovereign\nstates can sign treaties with one another to provide a legal basis for\ntheir relations. At the same time, however, Hobbes seems aware that\ninternational rules will often prove ineffective in restraining the\nstruggle for power. States will interpret them to their own advantage,\nand so international law will be obeyed or ignored according to the\ninterests of the states affected. Hence, international relations will\nalways tend to be a precarious affair. This grim view of global\npolitics lies at the core of Hobbes’s realism. \n\nTwentieth-century realism was born in response to the idealist\nperspective that dominated international relations scholarship in the\naftermath of the First World War. The idealists of the 1920s and 1930s\n(also called liberal internationalists or utopians) had the goal of\nbuilding peace in order to prevent another world conflict. They saw the\nsolution to inter-state problems as being the creation of a respected\nsystem of international law, backed by international organizations.\nThis interwar idealism resulted in the founding of the League of\nNations in 1920 and in the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928 outlawing war\nand providing for the peaceful settlements of disputes. U.S. President\nWoodrow Wilson, scholars such as Norman Angell, Alfred Zimmern, and\nRaymond B. Fosdick, and other prominent idealists of the era, gave\ntheir intellectual support to the League of Nations. Instead of\nfocusing on what some might see as the inevitability of conflict\nbetween states and peoples, they chose to emphasize the common\ninterests that could unite humanity, and attempted to appeal to\nrationality and morality. For them, war did not originate in an\negoistic human nature, but rather in imperfect social conditions and\npolitical arrangements, which could be improved. Yet their ideas were\nalready being criticized in the early 1930s by Reinhold Niebuhr and\nwithin a few years by E. H. Carr. The League of Nations, which the\nUnited States never joined, and from which Japan and Germany withdrew,\ncould not prevent the outbreak of the Second World War. This fact,\nperhaps more than any theoretical argument, produced a strong realist\nreaction. Although the United Nations, founded in 1945, can still be\nregarded as a product of idealist political thinking, the discipline of\ninternational relations was profoundly influenced in the initial years\nof the post-war period by the works of “classical” realists\nsuch as John H. Herz, Hans Morgenthau, George Kennan, and Raymond Aron.\nThen, during the 1950s and 1960s, classical realism came under\nchallenge of scholars who tried to introduce a more scientific approach\nto the study of international politics. During the 1980s it gave way to\nanother trend in international relations theory—neorealism. \n\nSince it is impossible within the scope of this article to introduce\nall of the thinkers who contributed to the development of\ntwentieth-century classical realism, E. H. Carr and Hans Morgenthau, as\nperhaps the most influential among them, have been selected for\ndiscussion here. \n\nIn his main work on international relations, The Twenty\nYears’ Crisis, first published in July 1939, Edward Hallett\nCarr (1892–1982) attacks the idealist position, which he describes as\n“utopianism.” He characterizes this position as\nencompassing faith in reason, confidence in progress, a sense of moral\nrectitude, and a belief in an underlying harmony of interests.\nAccording to the idealists, war is an aberration in the course of\nnormal life and the way to prevent it is to educate people for peace,\nand to build systems of collective security such as the League of\nNations or today’s United Nations. Carr challenges idealism by\nquestioning its claim to moral universalism and its idea of the harmony\nof interests. He declares that “morality can only be relative,\nnot universal” (19), and states that the doctrine of the harmony\nof interests is invoked by privileged groups “to justify and\nmaintain their dominant position” (75). \n\nCarr uses the concept of the relativity of thought, which he traces\nto Marx and other modern theorists, to show that standards by which\npolicies are judged are the products of circumstances and interests.\nHis central idea is that the interests of a given party always\ndetermine what this party regards as moral principles, and hence, these\nprinciples are not universal. Carr observes that politicians, for\nexample, often use the language of justice to cloak the particular\ninterests of their own countries, or to create negative images of other\npeople to justify acts of aggression. The existence of such instances\nof morally discrediting a potential enemy or morally justifying\none’s own position shows, he argues, that moral ideas are derived\nfrom actual policies. Policies are not, as the idealists would have it,\nbased on some universal norms, independent of interests of the parties\ninvolved. \n\nIf specific moral standards are de facto founded on interests,\nCarr’s argument goes, there are also interests underlying what\nare regarded as absolute principles or universal moral values. While\nthe idealists tend to regard such values, such as peace or justice, as\nuniversal and claim that upholding them is in the interest of all, Carr\nargues against this view. According to him, there are neither universal\nvalues nor universal interests. He claims that those who refer to universal\ninterests are in fact acting in their own interests (71). They think that what is best for them is best for everyone, and identify their own\ninterests with the universal interest of the world at large. \n\nThe idealist concept of the harmony of interests is based\non the notion that human beings can rationally recognize that they have\nsome interests in common, and that cooperation is therefore possible.\nCarr contrasts this idea with the reality of conflict of\ninterests. According to him, the world is torn apart by the\nparticular interests of different individuals and groups. In such a\nconflictual environment, order is based on power, not on morality.\nFurther, morality itself is the product of power (61). Like Hobbes,\nCarr regards morality as constructed by the particular legal system\nthat is enforced by a coercive power. International moral norms are\nimposed on other countries by dominant nations or groups of nations\nthat present themselves as the international community as a whole. They\nare invented to perpetuate those nations’ dominance. \n\nValues that idealists view as good for all, such as peace, social\njustice, prosperity, and international order, are regarded by Carr as\nmere status quo notions. The powers that are satisfied with\nthe status quo regard the arrangement in place as just and therefore\npreach peace. They try to rally everyone around their idea of what is\ngood. “Just as the ruling class in a community prays for domestic\npeace, which guarantees its own security and predominance, … so\ninternational peace becomes a special vested interest of predominant\npowers” (76). On the other hand, the unsatisfied powers consider\nthe same arrangement as unjust, and so prepare for war. Hence, the way\nto obtain peace, if it cannot be simply enforced, is to satisfy the\nunsatisfied powers. “Those who profit most by [international]\norder can in the longer run only hope to maintain it by making\nsufficient concessions to make it tolerable to those who profit by it\nleast” (152). The logical conclusion to be drawn by the reader of\nCarr’s book is the policy of appeasement. \n\nCarr was a sophisticated thinker. He recognized himself that the logic\nof “pure realism can offer nothing but a naked struggle for\npower which makes any kind of international society impossible”\n(87). Although he demolishes what he calls “the current\nutopia” of idealism, he at the same time attempts to build\n“a new utopia,” a realist world order\n(ibid.). Thus, he acknowledges that human beings need certain\nfundamental, universally acknowledged norms and values, and\ncontradicts his own argument by which he tries to deny universality to\nany norms or values. To make further objections, the fact that the\nlanguage of universal moral values can be misused in politics for the\nbenefit of one party or another, and that such values can only be\nimperfectly implemented in political institutions, does not mean that\nsuch values do not exist. There is a deep yearning in many human\nbeings, both privileged and unprivileged, for peace, order,\nprosperity, and justice. The legitimacy of idealism consists in the\nconstant attempt to reflect upon and uphold these values. Idealists\nfail if in their attempt they do not pay enough attention to the\nreality of power. On the other hand, in the world of pure realism, in\nwhich all values are made relative to interests, life turns into\nnothing more than a power game and is unbearable. \n\nThe Twenty Years’ Crisis touches on a number of\nuniversal ideas, but it also reflects the spirit of its time. While we\ncan fault the interwar idealists for their inability to construct\ninternational institutions strong enough to prevent the outbreak of the\nSecond World War, this book indicates that interwar realists were\nlikewise unprepared to meet the challenge. Carr frequently refers to\nGermany under Nazi rule as if it were a country like any other. He says\nthat should Germany cease to be an unsatisfied power and “become\nsupreme in Europe,” it would adopt a language of international\nsolidarity similar to that of other Western powers (79). The inability\nof Carr and other realists to recognize the perilous nature of Nazism,\nand their belief that Germany could be satisfied by territorial\nconcessions, helped to foster a political environment in which the\nlatter was to grow in power, annex Czechoslovakia at will, and be\nmilitarily opposed in September 1939 by Poland alone. \n\nA theory of international relations is not just an intellectual\nenterprise; it has practical consequences. It influences our thinking\nand political practice. On the practical side, the realists of the\n1930s, to whom Carr gave intellectual support, were people opposed to\nthe system of collective security embodied in the League of Nations.\nWorking within the foreign policy establishments of the day, they\ncontributed to its weakness. Once they had weakened the League, they\npursued a policy of appeasement and accommodation with Germany as an\nalternative to collective security (Ashworth 46). After the annexation\nof Czechoslovakia, when the failure of the anti-League realist\nconservatives gathered around Neville Chamberlain and of this policy\nbecame clear, they tried to rebuild the very security system they had\nearlier demolished. Those who supported collective security were\nlabeled idealists. \n\nHans J. Morgenthau (1904–1980) developed realism into a\ncomprehensive international relations theory. Influenced by the\nProtestant theologian and political writer Reinhold Niebuhr, as well as\nby Hobbes, he places selfishness and power-lust at the center of his\npicture of human existence. The insatiable human lust for power,\ntimeless and universal, which he identifies with animus\ndominandi, the desire to dominate, is for him the main cause of\nconflict. As he asserts in his main work, Politics among Nations:\nThe Struggle for Power and Peace, first published in 1948,\n“international politics, like all politics, is a struggle for\npower” (25). \n\nMorgenthau systematizes realism in international relations on the\nbasis of six principles that he includes in the second edition of\nPolitics among Nations. As a traditionalist, he opposes\nthe so-called scientists (the scholars who, especially in the\n1950s, tried to reduce the discipline of international relations to a\nbranch of behavioral science). Nevertheless, in the first principle he states that\nrealism is based on objective laws that have their roots in unchanging\nhuman nature (4). He wants to develop realism into both a theory of\ninternational politics and a political art, a useful tool of foreign\npolicy. \n\nThe keystone of Morgenthau’s realist theory is the concept\nof power or “of interest defined in terms of power,”\nwhich informs his second principle: the assumption that political\nleaders “think and act in terms of interest defined as\npower” (5). This concept defines the autonomy of politics, and\nallows for the analysis of foreign policy regardless of the different\nmotives, preferences, and intellectual and moral qualities of\nindividual politicians. Furthermore, it is the foundation of a rational\npicture of politics. \n\nAlthough, as Morgenthau explains in the third principle, interest\ndefined as power is a universally valid category, and indeed an\nessential element of politics, various things can be associated with\ninterest or power at different times and in different circumstances.\nIts content and the manner of its use are determined by the political\nand cultural environment. \n\nIn the fourth principle, Morgenthau considers the relationship between\nrealism and ethics. He says that while realists are aware of the moral\nsignificance of political action, they are also aware of the tension\nbetween morality and the requirements of successful political\naction. “Universal moral principles,” he asserts,\n“cannot be applied to the actions of states in their abstract\nuniversal formulation, but …they must be filtered through the\nconcrete circumstances of time and place” (9). These principles\nmust be accompanied by prudence for as he cautions “there can be\nno political morality without prudence; that is, without consideration\nof the political consequences of seemingly moral action”\n(ibid.). \n\nPrudence, and not conviction of one’s own moral or ideological\nsuperiority, should guide political action. This is stressed in the\nfifth principle, where Morgenthau again emphasizes the idea that all\nstate actors, including our own, must be looked at solely as political\nentities pursuing their respective interests defined in terms of power.\nBy taking this point of view vis-à-vis its counterparts and thus\navoiding ideological confrontation, a state would then be able to\npursue policies that respected the interests of other states, while\nprotecting and promoting its own. \n\nInsofar as power, or interest defined as power, is the concept that\ndefines politics, politics is an autonomous sphere, as Morgenthau says\nin his sixth principle of realism. It cannot be subordinated to ethics.\nHowever, ethics does still play a role in politics. “A man who\nwas nothing but ‘political man’ would be a beast, for he\nwould be completely lacking in moral restraints. A man who was nothing\nbut ‘moral man’ would be a fool, for he would be completely\nlacking in prudence” (12). Political art requires that these two\ndimensions of human life, power and morality, be taken into\nconsideration. \n\nWhile Morgenthau’s six principles of realism contain\nrepetitions and inconsistencies, we can nonetheless obtain from them\nthe following picture: Power or interest is the central concept that\nmakes politics into an autonomous discipline. Rational state actors\npursue their national interests. Therefore, a rational theory of\ninternational politics can be constructed. Such a theory is not\nconcerned with the morality, religious beliefs, motives or ideological\npreferences of individual political leaders. It also indicates that in\norder to avoid conflicts, states should avoid moral crusades or\nideological confrontations, and look for compromise based solely on\nsatisfaction of their mutual interests. \n\nAlthough he defines politics as an autonomous sphere, Morgenthau\ndoes not follow the Machiavellian route of completely removing ethics\nfrom politics. He suggests that, although human beings are political\nanimals, who pursue their interests, they are moral animals. Deprived\nof any morality, they would descend to the level of beasts or\nsub-humans. Even if it is not guided by universal moral principles,\npolitical action thus has for Morgenthau a moral significance.\nUltimately directed toward the objective of national survival, it also\ninvolves prudence. The effective protection of citizens’ lives\nfrom harm is not merely a forceful physical action; it has prudential\nand moral dimensions. \n\nMorgenthau regards realism as a way of thinking about international\nrelations and a useful tool for devising policies. However, some of the\nbasic conceptions of his theory, and especially the idea of conflict as\nstemming from human nature, as well as the concept of power itself,\nhave provoked criticism. \n\nInternational politics, like all politics, is for Morgenthau a\nstruggle for power because of the basic human lust for power. But\nregarding every individual as being engaged in a perpetual quest for\npower—the view that he shares with Hobbes—is a questionable premise. Human nature cannot be revealed by observation and experiment. It cannot be proved by any empirical research, but only disclosed by philosophy, imposed on us as a matter of belief, and inculcated by education. \n\nMorgenthau himself reinforces the belief in the human drive for power by introducing a normative aspect of his theory, which is rationality. A rational foreign policy\nis considered “to be a good foreign policy” (7). But he defines rationality as a process of calculating the costs and benefits of all alternative policies in order to determine their relative\nutility, i.e. their ability to maximize power. Statesmen “think\nand act in terms of interest defined as power” (5). Only\nintellectual weakness of policy makers can result in foreign policies\nthat deviate from a rational course aimed at minimizing risks and\nmaximizing benefits. Hence, rather than presenting an actual portrait of human\naffairs, Morgenthau emphasizes the pursuit of power and the rationality of this pursuit, and sets it up as a norm. \n\nAs Raymond Aron and other scholars have noticed, power, the\nfundamental concept of Morgenthau’s realism, is ambiguous. It can\nbe either a means or an end in politics. But if power is only a means\nfor gaining something else, it does not define the nature of\ninternational politics in the way Morgenthau claims. It does not allow\nus to understand the actions of states independently from the motives\nand ideological preferences of their political leaders. It cannot serve\nas the basis for defining politics as an autonomous sphere.\nMorgenthau’s principles of realism are thus open to doubt.\n“Is this true,” Aron asks, “that states, whatever\ntheir regime, pursue the same kind of foreign policy” (597) and\nthat the foreign policies of Napoleon or Stalin are essentially\nidentical to those of Hitler, Louis XVI or Nicholas II, amounting to no\nmore than the struggle for power? “If one answers yes, then the\nproposition is incontestable, but not very instructive” (598).\nAccordingly, it is useless to define actions of states by exclusive\nreference to power, security or national interest. International\npolitics cannot be studied independently of the wider historical and\ncultural context. \n\nAlthough Carr and Morgenthau concentrate primarily on international\nrelations, their realism can also be applied to domestic politics. To\nbe a classical realist is in general to perceive politics as a\nconflict of interests and a struggle for power, and to seek peace by\nrecognizing common interests and trying to satisfy them, rather than\nby moralizing. Bernard Williams and Raymond Geuss, influential\nrepresentatives of the new political realism, a movement in\ncontemporary political theory, criticize what they describe as\n“political moralism” and stress the autonomy of politics\nagainst ethics. However, political theory realism and international\nrelations realism seem like two separate research programs. As noted\nby several scholars (William Scheuerman, Alison McQueen, Terry\nNardin. Duncan Bell), those who contribute to realism in political\ntheory give little attention to those who work on realism in\ninternational politics. \n\nIn spite of its ambiguities and weaknesses, Morgenthau’s\nPolitics among Nations became a standard textbook and\ninfluenced thinking about international politics for a generation or\nso. At the same time, there was an attempt to develop a more methodologically rigorous approach to theorizing about international affairs. In the 1950s and 1960s a large influx of scientists from different fields entered the discipline of International Relations and attempted to replace the “wisdom literature” of classical realists with scientific concepts and reasoning (Brown 35). This in turn provoked a counterattack by Morgenthau and scholars associated with the so-called English School, especially Hedley Bull, who defended a traditional approach (Bull 1966). \nAs a result, the IR discipline has been divided into two main strands: traditional or non-positivist and scientific or positivist (neo-positivist). At a later stage the third strand: post-positivism has been added. The traditionalists raise normative questions and engage with history, philosophy and law. The scientists or positivists stress a descriptive and explanatory form of inquiry, rather than a normative one. They have established a strong presence in the field. Already by the mid-1960s, the majority of American students in international relations were trained in quantitative research, game theory, and other new research techniques of the social sciences. This, along with the changing international environment, had a significant effect on the discipline.\n \n\nThe realist assumption was that the state is the key actor in international politics, and that relations among states are the core of actual international relations. However, with the receding of the Cold War during the 1970s, one could witness the growing importance of international and non-governmental organizations, as well as of multinational corporations. This development led to a revival of idealist thinking, which became known as neoliberalism or pluralism. While accepting some basic assumptions of realism, the leading pluralists, Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye, have proposed the concept of\ncomplex interdependence to describe this more sophisticated picture of global politics. They would argue that there can be progress in international relations and that the future does not need to look like the past. \n\nThe realist response came most prominently from Kenneth N. Waltz,\nwho reformulated realism in international relations in a new and\ndistinctive way. In his book Theory of International Politics,\nfirst published in 1979, he responded to the liberal challenge and\nattempted to cure the defects of the classical realism of Hans\nMorgenthau with his more scientific approach, which has became known as\nstructural realism or neorealism. Whereas Morgenthau rooted his theory\nin the struggle for power, which he related to human nature, Waltz made\nan effort to avoid any philosophical discussion of human nature, and\nset out instead to build a theory of international politics analogous\nto microeconomics. He argues that states in the international system\nare like firms in a domestic economy and have the same fundamental\ninterest: to survive. “Internationally, the environment of\nstates’ actions, or the structure of their system, is set by the\nfact that some states prefer survival over other ends obtainable in the\nshort run and act with relative efficiency to achieve that end”\n(93). \n\nWaltz maintains that by paying attention to the individual state,\nand to ideological, moral and economic issues, both traditional\nliberals and classical realists make the same mistake. They fail to\ndevelop a serious account of the international system—one that\ncan be abstracted from the wider socio-political domain. Waltz\nacknowledges that such an abstraction distorts reality and omits many\nof the factors that were important for classical realism. It does not\nallow for the analysis of the development of specific foreign policies.\nHowever, it also has utility. Notably, it assists in understanding the\nprimary determinants of international politics. To be sure, Waltz’s\nneorealist theory cannot be applied to domestic politics. It cannot\nserve to develop policies of states concerning their international or\ndomestic affairs. His theory helps only to explain why states behave in\nsimilar ways despite their different forms of government and diverse\npolitical ideologies, and why, despite their growing\ninterdependence, the overall picture of international relations is\nunlikely to change. \n\nAccording to Waltz, the uniform behavior of states over centuries\ncan be explained by the constraints on their behavior that are imposed\nby the structure of the international system. A system’s\nstructure is defined first by the principle by which it is organized,\nthen by the differentiation of its units, and finally by the\ndistribution of capabilities (power) across units. Anarchy, or the\nabsence of central authority, is for Waltz the ordering principle of\nthe international system. The units of the international system are\nstates. Waltz recognizes the existence of non-state actors, but\ndismisses them as relatively unimportant. Since all states want to\nsurvive, and anarchy presupposes a self-help system in which each state\nhas to take care of itself, there is no division of labor or functional\ndifferentiation among them. While functionally similar, they are\nnonetheless distinguished by their relative capabilities (the power\neach of them represents) to perform the same function. \n\nConsequently, Waltz sees power and state behavior in a different way\nfrom the classical realists. For Morgenthau power was both a means and\nan end, and rational state behavior was understood as simply the\ncourse of action that would accumulate the most power. In contrast,\nneorealists assume that the fundamental interest of each state is\nsecurity and would therefore concentrate on the distribution of power.\nWhat also sets neorealism apart from classical realism is\nmethodological rigor and scientific self-conception (Guzinni 1998,\n127–128). Waltz insists on empirical testability of knowledge and on\nfalsificationism as a methodological ideal, which, as he himself\nadmits, can have only a limited application in international\nrelations.\n \n\nThe distribution of capabilities among states can vary; however,\nanarchy, the ordering principle of international relations, remains\nunchanged. This has a lasting effect on the behavior of states that\nbecome socialized into the logic of self-help. Trying to refute\nneoliberal ideas concerning the effects of interdependence, Waltz\nidentifies two reasons why the anarchic international system limits\ncooperation: insecurity and unequal gains. In the context of anarchy,\neach state is uncertain about the intentions of others and is afraid\nthat the possible gains resulting from cooperation may favor other\nstates more than itself, and thus lead it to dependence on others.\n“States do not willingly place themselves in situations of\nincreased dependence. In a self-help system, considerations of security\nsubordinate economic gain to political interest.” (Waltz 1979,\n107). \n\nBecause of its theoretical elegance and methodological rigor,\nneorealism has become very influential within the discipline of\ninternational relations. In the eyes of many scholars, Morgenthau’s\nrealism has come to be seen as anachronistic—“an\ninteresting and important episode in the history of thinking about the\nsubject, no doubt, but one scarcely to be seen as a serious\ncontribution of the rigorously scientific theory” (Williams\n2007, 1). However, while initially gaining more acceptance than\nclassical realism, neorealism has also provoked strong critiques on a\nnumber of fronts. \n\nIn 1979 Waltz wrote that in the nuclear age the international\nbipolar system, based on two superpowers—the United States and\nthe Soviet Union—was not only stable but likely to persist\n(176–7). With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent\ndisintegration of the USSR this prediction was proven wrong. The\nbipolar world turned out to have been more precarious than most realist\nanalysts had supposed. Its end opened new possibilities and challenges\nrelated to globalization. This has led many critics to argue that\nneorealism, like classical realism, cannot adequately account for\nchanges in world politics. \n\nThe new debate between international (neo)realists and (neo)liberals\nis no longer concerned with the questions of morality and human nature,\nbut with the extent to which state behavior is influenced by the anarchic\nstructure of the international system rather than by institutions, learning and other factors that are conductive to cooperation. In his 1989 book International\nInstitutions and State Power, Robert Keohane accepts Waltz’s\nemphasis on system-level theory and his general assumption that states\nare self-interested actors that rationally pursue their goals. However,\nby employing game theory he shows that states can widen the perception\nof their self-interest through economic cooperation and involvement in\ninternational institutions. Patterns of interdependence can thus affect\nworld politics. Keohane calls for systemic theories that would be able\nto deal better with factors affecting state interaction, and with\nchange. \n\nCritical theorists, such as Robert W. Cox, also focus on the alleged\ninability of neorealism to deal with change. In their view,\nneorealists take a particular, historically determined state-based\nstructure of international relations and assume it to be universally\nvalid. In contrast, critical theorists believe that by analyzing the\ninterplay of ideas, material factors, and social forces, one can\nunderstand how this structure has come about, and how it may\neventually change. They contend that neorealism ignores both the\nhistorical process during which identities and interests are formed,\nand the diverse methodological possibilities. It legitimates the\nexisting status quo of strategic relations among states and considers\nthe scientific method as the only way of obtaining knowledge. It\nrepresents an exclusionary practice, an interest in domination and\ncontrol. \n\nWhile realists are concerned with relations among states, the focus\nfor critical theorists is social emancipation. Despite their\ndifferences, critical theory, postmodernism and feminism all take issue\nwith the notion of state sovereignty and envision new political\ncommunities that would be less exclusionary vis-à-vis marginal\nand disenfranchised groups. Critical theory argues against state-based\nexclusion and denies that the interests of a country’s citizens\ntake precedence over those of outsiders. It insists that politicians\nshould give as much weight to the interests of foreigners as they give\nto those of their compatriots and envisions political structures beyond\nthe “fortress” nation-state. Postmodernism questions the\nstate’s claim to be a legitimate focus of human loyalties and its\nright to impose social and political boundaries. It supports cultural\ndiversity and stresses the interests of minorities. Feminism argues\nthat the realist theory exhibits a masculine bias and advocates the\ninclusion of woman and alternative values into public life. \n\nSince critical theories and other alternative theoretical perspectives question the existing status quo, make knowledge dependent on power, and emphasize identity formation and social change, they are not traditional or non-positivist. They are sometimes called “reflectivist” or “post-positivist” (Weaver 165) and represent a radical departure from the neorealist and neoliberal “rationalist” or “positivist” \ninternational relation theories. Constructivists, such as Alexander Wendt, try to build a bridge between these two approaches by on the one hand, taking the present state system and anarchy seriously, and on the other hand, by focusing on the formation of identities and interests. Countering neorealist ideas, Wendt argues that self-help does not follow logically or casually from the principle of anarchy. It is socially constructed. Wendt’s idea that states’ identities and\ninterests are socially constructed has earned his position the label\n“constructivism”. Consequently, in his view,\n“self-help and power politics are institutions, and not essential\nfeatures of anarchy. Anarchy is what states make of it” (Wendt\n1987 395). There is no single logic of anarchy but rather several,\ndepending on the roles with which states identify themselves and each\nother. Power and interests are constituted by ideas and norms. Wendt\nclaims that neorealism cannot account for change in world politics, but\nhis norm-based constructivism can. \n\nA similar conclusion, although derived in a traditional way, comes\nfrom the non-positivist theorists of the English school (International Society\napproach) who emphasize both systemic and normative constraints on the\nbehavior of states. Referring to the classical view of the human being\nas an individual that is basically social and rational, capable of\ncooperating and learning from past experiences, these theorists\nemphasize that states, like individuals, have legitimate interests that\nothers can recognize and respect, and that they can recognize the\ngeneral advantages of observing a principle of reciprocity in their\nmutual relations (Jackson and Sørensen 167). Therefore, states\ncan bind themselves to other states by treaties and develop some common\nvalues with other states. Hence, the structure of the international\nsystem is not unchangeable as the neorealists claim. It is not a\npermanent Hobbesian anarchy, permeated by the danger of war. An\nanarchic international system based on pure power relations among\nactors can evolve into a more cooperative and peaceful international\nsociety, in which state behavior is shaped by commonly shared values\nand norms. A practical expression of international society are\ninternational organizations that uphold the rule of law in\ninternational relations, especially the UN. \n\nAn unintended and unfortunate consequence of the debate about\nneorealism is that neorealism and a large part of its critique (with\nthe notable exception of the English School) has been expressed in abstract\nscientific and philosophical terms. This has made the theory of\ninternational politics almost inaccessible to a layperson and has\ndivided the discipline of international relations into incompatible\nparts. Whereas classical realism was a theory aimed at supporting\ndiplomatic practice and providing a guide to be followed by those\nseeking to understand and deal with potential threats, today’s\ntheories, concerned with various grand pictures and projects, are\nill-suited to perform this task. This is perhaps the main reason why\nthere has been a renewed interest in classical\nrealism, and particularly in the ideas of Morgenthau. Rather than\nbeing seen as an obsolete form of pre-scientific realist thought,\nsuperseded by neorealist theory, his thinking is now considered to be\nmore complex and of greater contemporary relevance than was\nearlier recognized (Williams 2007, 1–9). It fits uneasily in the\northodox picture of realism he is usually associated with.\n \nIn recent years, scholars have questioned prevailing narratives about\nclear theoretical traditions in the discipline of international\nrelations. Thucydides, Machiavelli, Hobbes and other thinkers have\nbecome subject to re-examination as a means of challenging prevailing\nuses of their legacies in the discipline and exploring other lineages\nand orientations. Morgenthau has undergone a similar process of\nreinterpretation. A number of scholars (Hartmut Behr, Muriel Cozette, Amelia Heath, Sean Molloy) have endorsed the importance of his thought as a source of change for the standard interpretation of realism. Murielle Cozette stresses Morgenthau’s critical dimension of\nrealism expressed in his commitment to “speak truth to\npower” and to “unmask power’s claims to truth and morality,” and in his tendency to assert different claims at different times (Cozette 10–12). She writes: “The protection of human life and freedom are given central importance by Morgenthau, and constitute a ‘transcendent standard of ethics’ which should always animate scientific enquiries” (19). This shows the flexibility of his classical realism and reveals his normative assumptions based on the promotion of universal moral values. While Morgenthau assumes that states are power-oriented actors, he at the same time acknowledges that international politics would be more pernicious than it actually is were it not for moral restraints and the work of international law(Behr and Heath 333).\n \nAnother avenue for the development of a realist theory of international relations is offered by Robert Gilpin’s seminal work War and Change in World Politics. If this work were to gain greater prominence in IR scholarship, instead of engaging in fruitless theoretical debates, we would be better prepared today “for rapid power shifts and geopolitical change ”(Wohlforth, 2011 505). We would be able to explain the causes of great wars and long periods of peace, and the creation and waning of international orders. Still another avenue is provided by the application of the new scientific discoveries to social sciences. The evidence for this is, for example, the recent work of Alexander Wendt, Quantum Mind and Social Science. A new realist approach to international politics could be based on the organic and holistic world view emerging from quantum theory, the idea of human evolution, and the growing awareness of the role of human beings in the evolutionary process (Korab-Karpowicz 2017).\n \nRealism is thus more than a static, amoral theory, and cannot be\naccommodated solely within a positivist interpretation of international\nrelations. It is a practical and evolving theory that depends on the actual\nhistorical and political conditions, and is ultimately judged by its\nethical standards and by its relevance in making prudent political\ndecisions (Morgenthau 1962). Realism also performs a useful cautionary\nrole. It warns us against progressivism, moralism, legalism, and other\norientations that lose touch with the reality of self-interest and\npower. Considered from this perspective, the neorealist revival of the 1970s can also be interpreted as a necessary corrective to an overoptimistic liberal belief in\ninternational cooperation and change resulting from\ninterdependence. \nNevertheless, when it becomes a dogmatic enterprise, realism fails to\nperform its proper function. By remaining stuck in a state-centric and\nexcessively simplified paradigm such as neorealism and by\ndenying the possibility of any progress in interstate relations, it\nturns into an ideology. Its emphasis on power politics and national\ninterest can be misused to justify aggression. It has therefore to be\nsupplanted by theories that take better account of the dramatically\nchanging picture of global politics. To its merely negative,\ncautionary function, positive norms must be added. These norms extend\nfrom the rationality and prudence stressed by classical realists;\nthrough the vision of multilateralism, international law, and an\ninternational society emphasized by liberals and members of the\nEnglish School; to the cosmopolitanism and global solidarity advocated\nby many of today’s writers.","contact.mail":"sopot_plato@hotmail.com","contact.domain":"hotmail.com"}]
