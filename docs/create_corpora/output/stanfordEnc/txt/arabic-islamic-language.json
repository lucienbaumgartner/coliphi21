For many years, western study of\nArabic logic tended to concentrate on the early parts of its history,\nespecially on the Greek antecedents of Arabic logic, and on the\nwritings of the foundational philosophers, Alfarabi (d. 950),\nAvicenna (d. 1037) and Averroes (d. 1198). Recently,\nhowever, there have been notable excursions beyond these areas of\ntraditional concentration, and I make a special effort in this entry\nto mention the contributions of post-twelfth-century logicians to the\nphilosophical resolution of disputed\n points.[1]\n\nSection 1 of this entry gives some historical context for a vast\narray of logical works, and section 2 provides a number of texts as\nsamples of the philosophical arguments they contain. The philosophical\nassessment of the arguments is a task that is now underway in the\nsecondary literature, and I refer to some of these assessments in the\nnotes. My primary interest, however, is in presenting a set of texts\nwhich illustrate the trajectory of arguments carried on through a\nformative period of the discipline.\n\nMy own preferred term for the material I cover is “Arabic\nlogic.” The term as I use it refers to a tradition of logic\nrooted in the texts translated from Greek into Arabic in a movement\nbeginning in the eighth century CE. The tradition gradually settled on\na set of technical terms with which to translate and discuss the\nAristotelian corpus and its associated late antique commentaries; it\nalso came to agree on what were the major problems in the corpus which\ndemanded resolution. Focussed at first on these problems, a continuous\nline of discussions has evolved and carried forward in one form or\nanother down to today.\n\nArabic logic can be said to be Islamic in two senses, both—in\nmy opinion—of limited significance. First, it is as a result of\nthe Muslim conquests from the seventh century on that Arabic came to\nbe the primary language of learning. Beyond determining the language\ninto which the founding texts of the movement were translated,\nhowever, the religion of the conquerors played no significant role in\nthe development of the subject. Secondly, the tradition of Arabic\nlogic after the thirteenth century was to find a place in the madrasa\neducation and, as a result, had to jostle with various Islamic\ndisciplines treating grammar, rhetoric and forensic argument; in the\nprocess, Arabic logic gave up its claims to deal with dialectical,\nrhetorical and poetical discourse. But by the time Arabic logic was\nestablished in the curriculum of the institutions of learning, most of\nthe formal aspects of what was forever after to be called\n“logic” (mantiq) had already crystallised.\n\nBeing conducted in Arabic is—on my\nunderstanding—neither necessary nor sufficient for a logic to be\nconsidered Arabic logic. The problematic of Arabic logic has been\nadopted and its register of technical terms calqued or translated into\nother languages such as Persian, Turkish, Hebrew and Urdu. To take one\nof many possible examples, Nasîr al-Dîn\nal-Tûsî's Asâs al-Iqtibâs, though\nwritten in Persian, was apt for exact rendition in Arabic in the\nfifteenth century precisely because it was Arabic logic written in\nanother language. By the same token, other traditions of logic have\nbeen conducted in Arabic but are not, on my usage, Arabic logic. The\nmodern logic in the tradition inaugurated by Frege taught in most\nmodern Arab universities, often in Arabic, is not Arabic logic. So\ntoo, if it is true that eighteenth-century Maronites wrote logical\ntreatises in Arabic based solely on the logic they had studied in\nRome, they were writing Latin logic in Arabic, not Arabic logic.\n\n\n\nThe Syriac Christians adopted a teaching tradition which included\na truncated version of the Alexandrian Organon\n(Porphyry's Eisagoge followed by\nthe Categories, On Interpretation, and the first\nseven chapters of the Prior Analytics). This teaching\ntradition continued without disruption through the Arab conquests and\nunder the Umayyad Caliphate (661–750). During this period, however, it\nevoked little if any interest on the part of the Muslim\nconquerors. It was the advent of the Abbasid Caliphate (750–1258) that\nsignalled the beginnings of an interest in philosophy on the part of\nthe ruling elite. This was to usher in a translation movement which in\nthe first place translated the Syriac decoctions of philosophy into\nArabic, but which later turned to the Aristotelian texts themselves\nand the commentaries written on them in late\nantiquity.[2] An\nexample of an Arabic translation produced before the Aristotelian turn\nis the translation by Ibn al-Muqaffa‘ (ex. 756) of a logic\ntreatise that probably came to him from the Syriac via the Pahlavi\n(probably from a late antique introduction to philosophy; see Gutas\n1993: 44 fn. 68). The treatise gestures towards the Eisagoge,\nthen turns to the Categories, On Interpretation, and\nthe introductory parts of the Prior Analytics on assertoric\nsyllogisms (Danishpazhuh 1978). As Pines pointed out long ago, this\nmaterial corresponds to the Old Logic (logica vetus) of the\nLatin West (Pines 1996). One must bear\nin mind, however, that there are important differences between\neighth-century Arabic logic and the Old Logic of the Latin tradition.\nFirst, there were Syriac translations of other Aristotelian logical\ntexts available throughout this period (e.g., the Posterior\nAnalytics; Elamrani-Jamal and Hugonnard-Roche\n1989), so\nthere were scholars about who had a good idea of what later texts in\nthe Organon had to offer. Secondly, soon after Ibn\nal-Muqaffa‘ had produced his treatise, other scholars were\ntranslating complete Aristotelian works into Arabic. We know, for\nexample, that the Caliph al-Mahdî (reg. 775–785) had\ncommissioned translations of the Topics and\nthe Sophistical Fallacies (Gutas 1993: 43). \nThe translation movement continued to pick up momentum through the\nninth century, and by the 830s a circle of translators were loosely\ncoordinated around Abû Yûsuf Ya‘qûb b.\nIshâq al-Kindî (d. c. 870). Kindî produced\na short overview of the whole of the Organon (translated in\nRescher 1963a), and members of his circle produced: an epitome of and\ncommentary on the Categories; an epitome of On\nInterpretation; a version of the Sophistical Fallacies;\nand probably an early translation of the\n Rhetoric.[3] \nSomewhat later, perhaps from the 850s, the great Syriac Christian\ntranslators Hunayn ibn Ishâq (d. 873) and his son\nIshâq ibn Hunayn (d. 910) began to produce integral\ntranslations of complete works from the Organon, generally by\nway of Syriac translations, some of which dated back to before the Arab\nconquests. One or the other (it is uncertain from the sources)\ntranslated the Categories, Ishâq translated On\nInterpretation, Hunayn seems to have collaborated with the\notherwise unknown Theodorus to translate the Prior Analytics,\nfather and son both seem to have had a hand in producing a new Syriac\ntranslation of the Posterior Analytics, and Ishâq\nprovided revised translations of\nthe Topics and the Rhetoric. Perhaps it was someone\nin this circle who translated the Poetics into\n Syriac.[4] \nIn spite of these achievements, Hunayn's circle is not unequivocally\nAristotelian. Hunayn himself was interested above all in Galen, and\nwhat we know of Galen's greatest logical work we know from citations in\nHunayn's reverential listing (Boudon 2000: 458 On Demonstration). \nSoon after, however, Baghdad philosophy was dominated by self-styled\nPeripatetics who presented themselves as reestablishing Aristotle's\ntrue teachings after a period of rupture. The leading lights of this\nmovement were the Syriac Christian Abû Bishr Mattâ ibn\nYûnus (d. 940) and his younger Muslim colleague, Abû\nNasr Alfarabi (d. 950). In the early 900s, Abû Bishr added\ntranslations from the Syriac of the Poetics and the Posterior\nAnalytics to the growing Arabic Organon. He and his\ncolleagues also contributed to a commentary tradition on each component\nof the Organon. \nAbû Bishr lumbers into every piece that has been written on the\nhistory of Arabic logic as the clumsy advocate of the view that\nspeakers of Arabic need to learn Greek logic. In a disputation on the\nrelative merits of grammar and logic convened for the amusement of the\nVizier, he confronts a dashing young opponent,\nSîrâfî, who confounds him with a series of\ngrammatical subtleties. To these, Abû Bishr responds: This is grammar, and I have not studied grammar. The\nlogician has no need of grammar, whereas the grammarian does need\nlogic. For logic enquires into the meaning, whereas grammar enquires\ninto the expression. If, therefore, the logician deals with the\nexpression, it is accidental, and it is likewise accidental if the\ngrammarian deals with the meaning. Now, the meaning is more exalted\nthan the expression, and the expression humbler than the\n meaning.[5] \nWhatever the merits of Abû Bishr's view of the relation of logic\nto language, it weathered Sîrâfî's storm of\ncriticism badly. Assessments differ as to what we should learn from\nthis discussion,[6]\nbut it serves at least to show that some were sceptical of the utility\nof Aristotelian logic. Other Muslim scholars went further than\nSîrâfî and considered the study of logic impious,\nmainly because of its association with metaphysics. As one fideist\nscholar put it many years later, “the access to something bad is\nalso bad” (Ibn as-Salâh (d. 1245), quoted in Goldziher\n1981: 205–206).  \nIt was Abû Bishr's younger colleague, Alfarabi, who was the\noutstanding contributor to the Aristotelian project, though not as a\ntranslator (see now Rudolph 2012). On the question of the relation of\nlogic to language, Alfarabi offers a view somewhat more nuanced than\nAbû Bishr's (see 2.1.1 below). He also\nclaimed that logic was indispensable for analysing the argument-forms\nused in jurisprudence and theology, a claim that was to be taken up a\ncentury later by Abû Hamid al-Ghazâlî\n(d. 1111), thereby preparing the way to introduce logic into the\nmadrasa (see 1.4.1 below). To support his claim,\nAlfarabi wrote The Short Treatise on Reasoning in the Way of the\nTheologians. …in which he interpreted the arguments of the\ntheologians and the analogies (qiyâsât) of the\njurists as logical\nsyllogisms in accordance with the doctrines of the\n ancients.[7] \nBut Alfarabi's main contribution to the Aristotelian project was a\nseries of commentaries on the books of the Organon—many\nof them\nsadly lost—which represent the finest achievement in the study of\nAristotelian logic in Arabic. His work in this area aims at the Lesser\nHarmony, the “project of forging a single, consistent doctrine\nout of the sometimes incongruent theories found in Aristotle's many\ntreatises;” and this marks him out as clinging\nto a major hermeneutical commitment of late antiquity (see Wisnovsky\n2003: 15, 266). The quality of Alfarabi's arguments is clear from his\nremaining long commentaries on\n Aristotle.[8]\n He is the first truly independent thinker\nin Arabic logic, a fact commemorated by the honorific bestowed upon him\nby Avicenna: the Second Teacher (after Aristotle). When Avicenna laid\nout his own syllogistic, he noted each point on which he differed from\nAlfarabi (Street 2001). \nThe tradition with which Alfarabi was associated, a tradition centred\non exegetical problems in the Organon, reached its crowning\nachievement—a superb and heavily glossed translation of\nthe\n Organon[9]—at\n the same time that Avicenna was\nsetting about his work in the East, work which was to make\nthe Organon irrelevant for the vast majority of subsequent\nArabic logicians. \nThis is a watershed moment: the Farabian tradition continued its work\non the Aristotelian texts, though ever more defensively and reactively\nto challenges posed by Avicenna. The Avicennan tradition by contrast\nsimply ignored the Aristotelian texts. The Farabian tradition shrank\naway so quickly that even by the late twelfth century, to study\nFarabian logic meant traveling to North\n Africa.[10] Spain and North\nAfrica were its last strongholds, and the work of Averroes \n(see 1.4.2 below) is best understood as a\ncommentary on Aristotle determined in its focus and direction by the\ncriticisms of Avicenna. \nAt the same time that the Baghdad philosophers were finalizing the\ntranslation of the Organon and furnishing it with extensive\nglosses, Avicenna (d. 1037) was beginning his career far away in\nthe east, in Khurasan. His style of philosophy was to make the\nAristotelian texts irrelevant for the dominant tradition of Arabic\nlogic after him. Led by his\n Intuition,[11]  \nhe presented himself as an\nautodidact able to assess and repair the Aristotelian\n tradition. In other words,\nAvicenna's doctrine of Intuition delivered him an Aristotelianism\nunfettered by the hermeneutic commitments of the Lesser Harmony. \nIn the modal logic, for example (a subject voluminously contested in\nthe Arabic tradition; see 2.3 below), \nhe cut through the problems in\nthe Aristotelian account by taking them either as tests of the\nstudent's acuity, or mistakes by Aristotle in implementing principles.\nHere is what he says in the Syllogism of the Cure,\nwritten about midway through his career: You should realize that most of what Aristotle's writings\nhave to say about the modal mixes are tests, and are not genuine\nopinions—this will become clear to you in a number of\nplaces… (Avicenna Qiyâs [1964]\n204.10–12) \nIn his later writings, Avicenna is less solicitous in explaining away\nwhat he regards as inconsistencies in Aristotle's syllogistic, and\nwrites of problems in the Prior Analytics as arising through\nnegligence; an example of such a text is Twenty Questions,\nwhich I think is written on the eve of Avicenna's Eastern period\n(Street 2010: 100–103; see periodization in Gutas 1988: 144). It\nconsists of answers to questions on syllogistic sent by the learned men\nof Shiraz (and thus shows how odd Avicenna's system\nmust have seemed to his contemporaries). Why, they ask, has Avicenna\nproduced a syllogistic system that differs so radically from\nAristotle's? At various points, we find Avicenna presenting Aristotle's\ndecisions (about mixes with possibility propositions as minor premises)\nas failures to implement general principles (Avicenna \nal-Masâ‘il al-Gharîba: [1974] 94.14, 94.20, 94.22, 95.5,\n95.11). \nAvicenna's Intuition not only set aside important parts of Aristotle's\nlogic, it also differed from Alfarabi's interpretation of that logic.\nAvicenna has, however, more consistently courteous ways of declining\nto follow Alfarabi. He refers to Alfarabi as the “eminent later\nscholar to whom we are most concerned to direct our remarks” as\nhe constructs his different system (see Street 2001). For a general overview of Avicenna's logic, there is now an English\ntranslation of the logic of Avicenna's Salvation (see Avicenna\n2011a). But of all his many\n works,[12]\n it is Avicenna's Pointers and Reminders that had most \nimpact on subsequent generations of\nlogicians. It became, as Ibn Taymiyya declared, the Koran of the\nphilosophers (Michot 2000: 599). From it we may note a few broad but\ntypical differences from the Prior Analytics in the\nsyllogistic. First, the “absolute” (mutlaqa,\noften translated “assertoric”) propositions have\ntruth-conditions stipulated such that they are temporally modalised (by\nan elided “at least once”, so that, for example, the contradictory of\nan absolute is not an absolute, absolute e-propositions do not convert,\nsecond-figure syllogisms with absolute\npremises are sterile; see also 2.3.1 below). Secondly, Avicenna begins\nto explore the logical properties of propositions of the form every\nJ is B while\nJ. Thirdly, Avicenna divides syllogistic into connective (iqtirânî)\nand repetitive (istithnâ‘î) forms, a division\nwhich replaces the old one into categorical and hypothetical (Avicenna\nal-Ishârât [1971] 309, 314, 374).  According to what we\nhave verified ourselves, the syllogism forms two divisions, connective\nand repetitive. The\nconnective is that in which one of the two sides of the contradiction\nin which we find the conclusion does not appear [in the premises]\nexplicitly, but only potentially… The repetitive is that in\nwhich [the conclusion or its contradictory] does explicitly appear.\n(Avicenna al-Ishârât [1971] 374) As\na rough guide, we may call a logician “Avicennan” if he\nadopts these doctrines. Pointers was not the only important\nAvicennan text in later Arabic logic: post-Avicennan logicians mined\nthe Cure's volume on the Prior Analytics\nfor the syllogistic with conditional premises, a syllogistic which they\nmodified perhaps even more than they modified Avicenna's modal syllogistic\n(see Khûnajî 2010: section 10; see also El-Rouayheb's\nIntroduction, xlv–xlviii). \nThe twelfth century is one of the most complex periods of\ntransformation in Muslim intellectual history. The century before had\nseen the advent of the madrasa as the prime institution of learning in\nthe Islamic world (Makdisi 1981: 27–32, especially 31), and Abû\nHâmid al-Ghazâlî (d. 1111) had been appointed to\nthe most prestigious of these new institutions. One of the most revered\nMuslim thinkers of all time, he took up Alfarabi's arguments in support\nof the utility of logic for theology and law, especially in his last\njuridical summa, Distillation of the Principles of Jurisprudence,\na text which soon became a mainstay of the madrasa. The late twelfth\ncentury also saw Averroes produce what was effectively the last of the\nwork in the Farabian tradition of logic, work which was to be\ntranslated into Hebrew and Latin but which was, with minor exceptions,\nneglected by Arabic logicians. Finally, through the course of the\ntwelfth century, the modified Avicennan logic that would be adopted by\nthe logic texts of the madrasa began to emerge. \nBefore, and especially through, the tenth and eleventh centuries, a\ndeal of effort was expended in defining which sciences constitute the\nproper focus of a scholar's education and how these sciences relate to\neach other. A fourteenth-century polymath divided the sciences of\ncivilization into those “natural to man and to which he is guided\nby his own ability to think, and a traditional kind that he learns from\nthose who invented it.” (Ibn-Khaldûn Muqaddima [1858]\n2:385). Earlier scholars had made a parallel distinction between the\nForeign Sciences and the Islamic Sciences. Philosophy was\nthe preeminent science of the first kind, and theology and\njurisprudence sciences of the second. Although logic was originally\npart of philosophy, and due to this association despised by many\ntheologians and jurists (noted above in 1.2), a change in attitude came\nabout in the twelfth century: It should be known that the early Muslims and the early\nspeculative theologians greatly disapproved of the study of this\ndiscipline. They vehemently attacked it and warned against it. They\nforbade the study and teaching of it. Later on, ever since\nGhazâlî (d. 1111) and Fakhraddîn\nar-Râzî (d. 1210), scholars have been somewhat more\nlenient in this respect. Since that time, they have gone on studying\nlogic, except for a few who have recourse to the opinion of the\nancients concerning it and shun it and vehemently disapprove of it\n(Ibn-Khaldûn Muqaddima [1858] 113.13-u; cf.\nIbn-Khaldûn\n1967: 3:143–144). \nGhazâlî had most impact in this regard (see Rudolph\n2005). I deal with Râzî's contribution below \n(see 1.5.1). \nGhazâlî argued that, properly understood, logic was\nentirely free of metaphysical presuppositions injurious to the faith.\nThis meant that logic could be used in forensic reasoning: We shall make known to you that speculation in juristic\nmatters (al-fiqhiyyât) is not distinct from speculation\nin\nphilosophical matters (al-‘aqliyyât) in terms of\nits composition,\nconditions, or measures, but only in terms of where it takes its\npremises from (Ghazâlî  Mi‘yâr [1961]\n28.2–4). \nGhazâlî tended to an even stronger position towards the end\nof his life: more than being merely harmless, logic was necessary for\ntrue knowledge. Here is what Ghazâlî has to say at the\nbeginning of his famous Distillation of the Principles of\nJurisprudence (referring back to two of his earlier works on\nlogic):  In this introduction we mention… the condition of\ntrue definition and true demonstration and their divisions in a\nprogram more concise than what we set out in our Touchstone for\nSpeculation and Yardstick of Knowledge [respectively,\nGhazâlî 1966 and Ghazâlî 1961]. This\nintroduction is not part of the sum of the science of [juristic]\nprinciples, nor among the preliminaries particular to it; rather it is\nan introduction to all the sciences, and he who does not comprehend\n[logic] is not to be trusted at all in his sciences.\n(Ghazâlî  Mustasfâ [1322 AH] 10.15–17) \nFor all his historical importance in the process of introducing logic\ninto the madrasa, the logic that Ghazâlî defended was too\ndilute to be recognizably Farabian or Avicennan. Averroes was one of the last representatives of a dying\nAristotelianism that bent all its efforts to the task of the Lesser\nHarmony, reconciling all of Aristotle's texts with each other. A\nstudent of the Baghdad philosophy that had been\ntransplanted to al-Andalus (Dunlop 1955), Averroes was trained in the\nlogic of Alfarabi, many specifics of which he later came to discard: One of the worst things a later scholar can do is to\ndeviate from Aristotle's teaching and follow a path other than\nAristotle's—this is what happened to Alfarabi in his logical\ntexts… (Averroes  Maqâlât [1983]\n175.6–8) \nFor Averroes, Alfarabi's attempts to make sense of the difficulties in\nAristotle's texts were too weak to anticipate and answer Avicenna's\ncriticisms. In one such area, the modal logic, Averroes was to return\nto the problems four times through his career (see Elamrani-Jamal\n1995), and near the end of his life, having assessed\nthe problems in his colleagues' interpretations, he wrote:  These are all the doubts in this matter. They kept\noccurring to us even when we used to go along in this matter with our\ncolleagues, in interpretations by virtue of which no solution to these\ndoubts is clear. This has led me now (given my high opinion of\nAristotle, and my belief that his theorization is better than that of\nall other people) to scrutinize this question seriously and with great\neffort. (Averroes  Maqâlât [1983] 181.6–10) \nAverroes' project in its full flowering is driven by the demands of\nthis rigorously construed Lesser Harmony and—in spite of\neverything—by Avicenna's increasingly popular reformulation of\nAristotelian doctrine. Both aspects of the Averroist project are in\nfull evidence in his Philosophical Essays,\na number of which are on logical matters. So, for example, Averroes\ndefends and refines Alfarabi's account of the conversion of modal\npropositions against Avicenna's attack, and then uses that account as\nthe basis of a new interpretation of the modal syllogistic (see Thom\n2003: chapter 5, working with fourth system described in\nElamrani-Jamal 1995). A second example of the way Averroes works is\nhis reappraisal and vindication of Aristotle's doctrines of the\nhypothetical syllogistic against Avicenna's alternative division into\nconnective and repetitive syllogisms (see Averroes  Maqâlât [1983]\nessay 9, 187–207). Those Arabic logicians who make use of Averroes tend\nto come from North Africa, or from Persia at certain moments of\nnostalgia for a time before the coming of the great logicians of the\nthirteenth century (see section 1.6 below). Further, Averroes' deep\nconcern with the Aristotelian texts made his work transportable to both\nHebrew and Latin philosophical traditions. \nBut the work on logic which was both technically advanced (and\ntherefore unlike Ghazâlî's) and influential on later Arabic\nlogicians (and therefore unlike Averroes') was done by Avicennan\nlogicians who had begun to repair and reformulate Avicenna's work. Just\nas Avicenna had declared himself free to rework\nAristotle as Intuition dictated, so too these logicians working on\nAvicenna's logic regarded themselves as free to repair the Avicennan\nsystem as need arose, whether from internal inconsistencies, or from\nintellectual requirements extrinsic to the system. A major early\nrepresentative of this trend is ‘Umar ibn Sahlân\nas-Sâwî (d. 1148) who began, in his Logical\nInsights for Nasîraddîn, to rework Avicenna's modal\nsyllogistic.[13]\nIt was to be his students and their students, however, who would go on\nto make the final changes to Avicennan logic that characterized the\nsubject that came to be taught in the madrasa. \nGhazâlî had successfully introduced logic into the madrasa\n(though it was studied in other venues as well (Endress 2006)). What\nhappened to it after this time was the result of the activities of\nlogicians much more gifted than Ghazâlî. This period has\ntentatively\nbeen called the Golden Age of Arabic philosophy (Gutas 2002). It is\nin this period, and especially in the thirteenth century, that the\nmajor changes in the coverage and structure of\nAvicennan logic were introduced; these changes were mainly introduced\nin free-standing treatises on logic. It has been observed that the\nthirteenth century was the time that “doing logic in Arabic was\nthoroughly\ndisconnected from textual exegesis, perhaps more so than at any time\nbefore or since” (El-Rouayheb 2010b: 48–49). Many of the major\ntextbooks for teaching logic in later centuries come from this\nperiod. \nIn the fourteenth century, Ibn Khaldûn (d. 1406) noted the\nways that Arabic logic had changed from the late twelfth century on (he\nmentions a growing restriction of the subject to the syllogistic,\nand a concentration on the formal aspects of logic; \nsee Text 14, 2.2.3 below), and names\n the scholars he thinks are responsible for the change. Treatment of [the subject as newly conceived] has become\nlengthy and wide-ranging—the first to do this was\nFakhraddîn ar-Râzî (d. 1210) and, after him,\nAfdaladdîn al-Khûnajî (d. 1248), on whom Eastern\nscholars rely even now… The books and ways of the ancients have\nbeen abandoned, as though they had never been (Ibn-Khaldûn \n  Muqaddima [1858] 113; cf. Ibn-Khaldûn 1967: 3:143). \nLet us consider the nature of the work of the first logician named,\nFakhraddîn ar-Râzî. Recent scholarly efforts have\nseen a number of Râzî's important works published, but\nthere has been relatively little analysis of his logic, with the\nexception of the commentary on his Compendium\nby A. Karamaleki & A. Asgharinizhad (see the second half of\nRâzî 2002). His teacher in logic was Majdaddîn\nal-Jîlî, who may have been Sâwî's\n student.[14] In spite of this\npedigree, the polite manner of correcting Avicenna's system that we\nfind in Sâwî's work is missing from Râzî's. In Gist\nof Pointers, Râzî sets out his own remarkably compact\naccount of the modals, and then says of Avicenna's exposition: When you have understood what we have mentioned, you will\ncome to realise that [my book], in spite of its brevity, is more\nexplanatory and better verified than what is found in [Pointers],\nin\nspite of its length. (Râzî  Lubâb [1355AH] 22.14–15) \nFor all his dismissive comments, Râzî's logic is above all\na development of the logic of Pointers,\npresented in ways that derive from Avicenna's methods of exposition.\nOne way to understand thirteenth-century Arabic logic, at least the\nlogic developed in Persia and surrounding territories, is as\nattempts to solve the dialectical aporia set up by Râzî; an\nexample of this dynamic will be given in section 2.3 below. And this\nis Avicennan logic: Râzî, like Sâwî,\nnever refers to an Aristotelian text, and refers to Alfarabi in such a\nfashion as to suggest that he is simply paraphrasing Avicenna's\nreferences.  \nIt is the second logician Ibn Khaldûn mentions who, it would\nseem, made more, and more substantive, changes to Avicennan logic:\nAfdaladdîn al-Khûnajî (d. 1249). His major work\non logic, the Disclosure of Secrets about the Obscurities of\nThoughts,\nhas recently been edited (Khûnajî\nKashf [2010], with a long\nintroduction including a biography of this\nimportant logician, and an overview of some of his more important\ninnovations). He was described, probably pretty loosely, as one of\nRâzî's students; Bar Hebraeus writes of\na group who were famed as “authors of major works on logic and\nphilosophy… [among them] Khûnajî in Cairo”\n(translated in Pococke 1663: 485.7–13 (Arabic)). The sense in which he\ncould have been Râzî's student is presumably that he\nstudied under someone who had studied under Râzî. It will\nbe some time before we are able to assess Khûnajî's\nimportance accurately; he seems to have exercised extraordinary\ninfluence, often\ntaking a strong stand against both Râzî's position and\nAvicenna's. In their different ways, both the North African and the\nEastern traditions of\nlogic are strongly influenced by Khûnajî \n(see section 1.6 below).\n \nKhûnajî's Disclosure inspired work by other great\nEastern logicians not mentioned by Ibn Khaldûn, namely,\nAthîraddîn al-Abharî (d. 1265) and\nNajmaddîn al-Kâtibî (d. 1276). Bar Hebraeus\nclaims that Abharî was also one of Râzî's students,\nthough as in the case with Khûnajî, opportunity for direct\ncontact must have been virtually non-existent.  Kâtibî was\nAbharî's student. So too, perhaps, was the great\nShî‘î scholar Nasiraddîn at-Tûsî\n(d. 1274); at any rate, he had read Râzî's commentary\non Avicenna's Pointers under Abharî (Endress 2006:\n411). These three men are among the greatest logicians working\nanywhere in the thirteenth century. Two of them, Kâtibî\nand Abharî, produced the two texts which became mainstays of the\nmadrasa teaching of logic, studied from the late thirteenth century\ndown to the present day: the Îsâghûjî\nand the Shamsiyya (see Calverley 1933 and\nKâtibî 1948). All three were also involved in a major intellectual project\nestablished by the îl-Khânid rulers in 1259: the Maragha\nObservatory. Tûsî had been given the task by the Mongols of\nsetting up an astronomical\nobservatory, and he asked Kâtibî (among others) to help\nhim. At some stage in the early years of the observatory, Abharî\njoined them. We know that Kâtibî was teaching both\nRâzî's Compendium and Khûnajî's Disclosure\nto students during this period, and that Abharî and\nTûsî were debating how best to deal with the challenges\nraised by Khûnajî to Avicenna's logic. Kâtibî's\nmajor works on logic (a long treatise, Summa of Subtle Points,\nand the textbook, the Shamsiyya)\nwere written after these discussions, and used many of the arguments\nraised in them. Kâtibî's Shamsiyya\nwas commented on by Qutbaddîn at-Tahtânî\n(d. 1365), among many others (for details about these other\ncommentaries, see Schmidtke 1991, 2013; Wisnovsky\n2004). Tahtânî's commentary records a great many of the\ntechnical debates going on among the scholars at the Maragha\nobservatory. Kâtibî's textbook\nand Tahtânî's commentary together constitute the\nimpressive\npreparation most Muslim scholars underwent in logic.  Tûsî is a particularly interesting logician in terms\nof his historical affiliations. He had come to Avicenna's Pointers\nby way of Râzî's students, but he developed a deeper\nrespect for Avicenna's formulations than any of his contemporaries.\nRâzî's hostility in characterizing the Avicennan exposition\nin Pointers is confronted by Tûsî in Solution\nto the Difficulties of Pointers. The nature of Tûsî's\nresponse to Râzî is generally taken to be entirely\nnegative—he relayed a description of Râzî's work as\nbeing “a butchery, not a commentary”—but in fact\nTûsî acknowledged the value of Râzî's work. The\nrhetorical engagement with Râzî is really part of a broader\ncampaign to defend not only Avicenna's logic but also his exposition of\nthat logic. To take one example: Avicenna's account of different kinds\nof absolute proposition had long raised questions among post-Avicennan\nlogicians. Tûsî explains why Avicenna explores it the way\nhe does: What spurred him to this was that in the assertoric\nsyllogistic Aristotle and others sometimes used contradictories of\nabsolute propositions on the assumption that they are absolute; and\nthat was why so many decided that absolutes did contradict absolutes.\nWhen Avicenna had shown this to be wrong, he wanted to give a way of\nconstruing those examples from Aristotle. (Tûsî\nSharh al-Ishârât [1971] 312.5–7) \n\nIt is in his other works that Tûsî took a more solid\nstand against substantive changes proposed for Avicennan logic,\nespecially in his Setting the Scale for an Evaluation of\n“Revealing Thoughts”, an extended assessment of\nAbharî's Revealing Thoughts (Tûsî 1974b),\nin which Abharî adopted a number of Khûnajî's\npositions. Here we\nfind not merely a sympathetic exposition of Avicennan logic as Avicenna\nwould have wanted it to be understood, but a reasoned attack\non the thinking behind alternative proposals. Tûsî went on\nwith this project in a series of exchanges with Kâtibî\n(Tûsî 1974a). \nAmong his other works, Tûsî wrote the Book of\nAbstraction as a non-polemical exposition of logic. His famous and\ninfluential student, al-‘Allâma al-Hillî\n(d. 1325), who had also studied under Kâtibî, wrote a\ncommentary on it, the Facetted Jewel on the Book of Abstraction\n(Hillî 1363 SH). It is only relatively recently (the late\nnineteenth century) that the text and commentary were printed and came\nto be used in Shî‘î seminaries to introduce logic\n(El-Rouayheb 2010b: 108 n77). On the face of it, the text is quite\nconservatively Aristotelian, its\nrubrics following the traditional course of topics covered in the Organon,\nand in the same order; for all that, the substantive doctrine seems on the\nwhole to be pristine Avicennan, precisely the doctrine Tûsî\ndefended against Râzî, Khûnajî, Abharî\nand Kâtibî. \nThe texts of Abharî and Kâtibî were used in the\nmadrasa by Sunnis and Shî‘îs (though the\nShî‘îs turned to the texts of Tûsî and\nHillî in the nineteenth century). But the tradition was much more\ndynamic than the entrenchment of these texts in the syllabus would\nsuggest. First, whatever introductory texts were used in teaching the\ndiscipline,\nit is clear that students who were attracted to logic studied well\nbeyond these texts with teachers at the madrasa who were often engaged\nto teach other subjects. Secondly, other places such as hospitals and\nobservatories provided less formal venues for the advanced study of\nlogic (see Endress 2006). \nBut it was the madrasa that provided the backbone of the tradition,\nand a number of jurists came time and again to stress that the study of\nlogic was so important to religion as to be a fard kifâya,\nthat is, a religious duty such that it is incumbent on the community to\nensure at least some scholars are able to pursue its study. As for the logic that is not mixed with philosophy, as in\n… the treatise of Athîraddîn al-Abharî\ncalled îsâghûjî and the works of\nal-Kâtibî [i.e., ash-Shamsiyya] and\nal-Khûnajî [Afdaladdîn (d. 1249),\ni.e., al-Jumal] and Sa‘daddîn\n[at-Taftâzânî, i.e., Tahdhîb\nal-Mantiq], there is no disagreement concerning the\npermissibility of engaging in it, and it is rejected only by he who\nhas no inkling of the rational sciences. Indeed, it is a fard\nkifâya because the ability to reply to heretical views in\nrational theology (kalâm), which is a fard\nkifâya, depends on mastering this science, and that which\nis necessary for a religious duty is itself a religious\nduty.[15] \nOf course, a fatwâ like this invites us to consider\nwhat logic mixed with philosophy might look like; one scholar\nmentioned in the study just quoted offers\nBaydâwî's Ascending Lights as such a logic\n(Baydâwî 2001). Baydâwî's logic itself seems\nharmless—a generalized Avicennan logic—, but it is placed\ndirectly before an exposition of a speculative theology strongly\ninfluenced by Avicennan philosophy. Different scholars would have held\ndifferent positions, but for the fatwâ quoted,\nperhaps the context surrounding a logic text is all that matters in\nmaking it acceptable or not. After 1350 or so, logical traditions began to crystallise, often on\na regional basis. Recent studies by El-Rouayheb (2010b) and Ahmed\n(2012) have provided preliminary sketches of the seven or so centuries\nof logical activity. Especially El-Rouayheb (2010b) makes it clear\nthat we cannot assume that there is a point at which original work\nstops and the tradition begins simply to restate ancient results. It\nis true that much of the later material is, unlike the bulk of the\nthirteenth-century material, presented as commentary. There is a\ntemptation to conclude from this that there was a decline in logical\nstudies in the realms under Muslim control that corresponds with the\nsixteenth-century decline of the subject in early modern Europe; such\na conclusion is seemingly supported by a tradition of scholarship\ndevoted to a luxuriation of layered commentary on a five hundred year\nold primary text. But genre by no means dictates content, and we often\nfind original work presented in this\n way.[16] Regionalism had been a significant factor especially in the\ntradition of logic studied in al-Andalus; more generally, the\ncrystallisation of traditions after Khûnajî also tended to\nbe regional. Although Khûnajî was read in North Africa, it\nwould seem that the Maragha logicians were not read there, at least\nnot systematically. By contrast, Averroes was still read and taught in\nNorth Africa up to the end of the fourteenth century, and so Ibn\nKhaldûn would have been taught Averroes as well as a decoction\nof Khûnajî's logic; his teacher, Muhammad al-Sharîf\nal-Tilimsânî (d. 1370), had written a substantial\ncommentary on a short work by Khûnajî,\nthe Sentences (El-Rouayheb 2010b: 71–79). At this stage of research, early modern logic\ntraditions may best be divided along the fault-lines of the great\nempires: Ottoman, Persian, and Indian. All of these traditions produced\nmassive amounts of work. With respect to the Persian tradition, I would\nnote merely that by the advent of the Safavids (1501), the\nphilosophical tradition was galvanized by a dispute between two leading\nscholars that had ground on for the last quarter of the preceding\ncentury, and this marked a point at which it became philosophically\nrespectable to prefer the ancient scholars to the more recent, and Averroes\nenjoyed a revival of interest from time to time as a result (see\nEl-Rouayheb 2010b: 92–104 for one aspect covered in the dispute, and\nPourjavady 2011: “Introduction” for the background). In the\nOttoman tradition, we find a flurry of impressive activity after 1600\namong logicians\ndealing with relational syllogisms (presented in El-Rouayheb 2010b:\nchapters 5, 6 & 7). Finally, with respect to the India, recent\nresearch shows the complexities of the formation of\nteaching traditions of logic there (sketched in Ahmed 2012). The coming of the metropolitan powers signals a convenient point at\nwhich we may speculate that important new possibilities opened up in\nArabic logic. At least some members of the Christian communities in\nthe capitulated territories in Syria and Lebanon trained in Europe. If\nthe books on logic they wrote in Arabic were simply Western logic,\nthen their works fall outside the purview of this entry; but I note\nthat Butrus al-Tûlâwî (d. 1745) in his\n1688 Introduction gives a definition of the syllogism which\ncomes from Khûnajî (see Khûnajî 2010:\n238.13–14), which is presumably the result of a syncretic process of\ngreat interest for the history of Arabic logic (pace El-Rouayheb\n2010b: 114ff). Again, the relevant texts must be edited and\n studied.[17] \n\nOf many possible candidates for consideration, the discussions around\nthree logical doctrines seem to me to be particularly instructive. The\nfirst has to do with the subject matter of logic, something which\nneeds to be identified if there is any prospect of presenting logic as\na science (something most parties to the debate at least claim to\nwant). The doctrine associated with Avicenna as to the subject matter\nof logic came to have decisive impact in the Latin logical tradition,\nthough it was not the only doctrine in play through the later Arabic\ntexts. The second and related set of doctrines has to do with offering\nan account of how the various logical disciplines—demonstration,\ndialectic, rhetoric and poetics—fit together. Inherited\nexpectations of what disciplines a logical treatise should cover came\nunder pressure from new disciplines derived from grammar and law;\nultimately, the disciplines of dialectic, rhetoric and poetics were no\nlonger treated in the ways they had been in the Aristotelian\ntradition. Finally, modal syllogistic was perhaps the most keenly\ndisputed topic in logic through the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,\nand I offer an overview of one line of discussion which took place. I\nlook in particular at arguments coming from eastern Iran in the\nthirteenth century—a tradition I call Maragha logic \n(see 1.5.2 above)—because this was a period of particularly intense\nlogical activity culminating in textbooks overwhelmingly important in\nthe subsequent teaching of the discipline. Let me go on immediately to acknowledge that these may not be the\nmost philosophically sophisticated or historically representative\ndiscussions which took place in the Arabic tradition (see e.g., Hodges\n2011a (in Other Internet Resources) on the subject matter of\nlogic). They do however all have the advantage of having been\ndiscussed by a number of Arabic logicians through the centuries, and\nof having been the subject of at least some academic study. Other\ncandidate topics illustrate what I seek to avoid. Consider the\nimpressive work by Avicenna on proof theory which has been translated\nand analysed by Hodges (2009, Other Internet Resources); to the extent\nthat I can follow this work, it exhibits a truly extraordinary level\nof logical acumen. At the same time I have never—in my\nadmittedly narrow reading in the tradition—seen another logician\ndevelop or even use Avicenna's results in this area. In short, the\ntopic illustrates Avicenna's logical genius rather than a common theme\nrunning through Arabic logic. Consider next the work in the Avicennan tradition on syllogisms\nwith conditional and disjunctive premises (see 1.3 above). This\nimportant material is original to Avicenna, used among other things in the\nanalysis of the reductio argument. If we consult\nKhûnajî's Disclosure, we find one quarter of the\nwork's four hundred pages given over to syllogisms with conditional or\ndisjunctive premises, developing the subject far beyond Avicenna's\noriginal insights in the Cure (and often in a manner fairly\ndismissive of Avicenna's work).  Khûnajî clearly looked on\nhis modifications to this part of Avicenna's logic as central to his\nproject, and his modifications were adopted by later logicians like\nKâtibî. If anything, this would be a better topic than the\nmodals to illustrate the distinctive characteristics of the\ndiscussions that went on in Arabic logic. In the present state of the\nfield, however, although there have been major studies of Avicenna's\nsyllogistic with hypothetical premises (e.g., Rescher 1963c; Shehaby\n1973; Gätje 1985), there is none at all—to the best of\nmy knowledge—on its reception and modification in the subsequent\ntradition. One or both of these reasons (that is, neglect by the\nsubsequent tradition and neglect in the secondary literature) rule out\nother major topics such as the theory of demonstration and what might\nbe called meta-syllogistic (but see, on the first, Hasnawi 2008;\nStrobino 2010, 2012; and on the second, El-Rouayheb\n2009; Hodges 2011c (in Other Internet Resources)). \nIt is common doctrine among medieval Latin logicians that logic is a\nlinguistic science. An associated doctrine is that logic makes up,\nwith grammar and rhetoric, the trivium, or the three arts of language.\nThere never was a trivium in the Arabic-speaking philosophical world,\nand when scholars spoke of the “three arts”\n(as-sinâ‘ât ath-thalâth), they were\nreferring to demonstration, dialectic and rhetoric. Clashes between\nscholars working on Greek texts and scholars working on the Arabic\nlanguage first served to pose the question of how logic related to\nlanguage, and specifically to the Arabic language. This in turn forced\nthe discussion of what the subject matter of logic is, and how its\nsubject matter differed from that of grammar. \nThe unpromising proposal made by Abû Bishr Mattâ in\nresponse to Sîrâfî's attack on logic (see 1.2 above)\nprompted Alfarabi to make a second attempt at explaining how logic,\ngrammar and language relate to each other. Text 1. This art [of logic] is similar\nto the art of grammar, in that the relation of the art of logic to the\nintellect and the intelligibles is like the relation of the art of\ngrammar to language and expressions (al-alfâz). That is,\nto every rule\nfor expressions which the science of grammar provides us, there is an\nanalogous [rule] for intelligibles which the science of logic provides\nus.[18] \nThis allows Alfarabi to go on to characterize the subject matter of\nlogic as follows:  \nText 2. The subject matters (mawdû‘ât)\nof logic are the things for which [logic] provides the rules, namely,\nintelligibles in so far as they are signified by expressions, and\nexpressions in so far as they signify intelligibles.  …  [Logic] shares something with grammar in that it provides\nrules\nfor expressions, yet it differs in that grammar only provides rules\nspecific to the expressions of a given community, whereas the science\nof logic provides common rules that are general for the expressions of\nevery community.[19] This is to say—and here I follow Black's characterization of\nthe doctrine—logic is something of a universal grammar or, more\nstrictly, providing a universal grammar is one of the tasks of logic.\nOther philosophers of the Baghdad school like Yahyâ ibn\n‘Adî (d. 974) by and large adopt Alfarabi's doctrine\n(see Endress 1977, 1978; cf. Black 1991: 48ff). (I think Alfarabi was\nbeing impelled towards holding that the subject matter of logic is\nsecondary intelligibles, and perhaps ultimately came to hold such a\ndoctrine (see Menn 2012: 68; Alfarabi Kitâb\nal-Hurûf [1970] 64, 66–67), but the position\ndescribed above represents the doctrine Avicenna was to react\nagainst.) \nAspects of this attempt to identify the subject matter of logic\ninvite clarification. First, is the intelligible corresponding to, say,\n“horse”, part of the subject matter of logic? Secondly, is\nreference to expressions essential in a definition of logic, as is\nsuggested by the phrase “intelligibles in so far as they are\nsignified by expressions”? \nA more careful statement of what was probably much the same\ndoctrine is provided by Avicenna. Concepts like “horse”,\n“animal”, “body”, correspond to entities in the\nreal world, entities which can have various properties. In the realm of\nthe mental, concepts too can acquire various properties, properties\nthey acquire simply by virtue of existing and being manipulated by the\nmind, properties like being a subject, or a predicate, or a genus.\nThese are the subject matter of logic, and it seems it is only mental\nmanipulation that gives rise to these properties. Text 3. If we wish to investigate things\nand gain knowledge of them we must bring them into conception\n(fî t-tasawwur); thus they necessarily acquire certain\nstates (ahwâl) that come to be in conception: we must\ntherefore consider those states which belong to them in conception,\nespecially as we seek by thought to arrive at things unknown from\nthose that are known. Now things can be unknown or known only in\nrelation to a mind; and it is in conception that they acquire what\nthey do acquire in order that we move from what is known to what is\nunknown regarding them, without however losing what belongs to them in\nthemselves; we ought, therefore, to have knowledge of these states and\nof their quantity and quality and of how they may be examined in this\nnew circumstance.[20] \nThese properties that concepts acquire are secondary intelligibles;\nhere is an exposition of this\npart of Avicennan doctrine by Râzî:  Text 4. The subject matter of logic is\nthe secondary intelligibles in so far as it is possible to pass by\nmeans of them from the known (al-ma‘lûmât)\nto the unknown (al-majhûlât). The explanation of\n“secondary intelligibles” is that man conceives the\nrealities of things (haqâ’iq al-ashyâ’) in\nthe first place, then qualifies some with others either restrictively\nor predicatively (hukman taqyîdiyyan aw\nkhabariyyan). The quiddity's being qualified in this way is\nsomething that only attaches to the quiddity after it has become known\nin the first place, so it is a second-order [consideration]\n(fî d-darajati th-thâniya). If these\nconsiderations are investigated, not absolutely, but rather with\nrespect to how it is possible to pass correctly by means of them from\nthe known to the unknown, that is logic. So its subject matter is\ncertainly the secondary intelligibles under the consideration\nmentioned above (Râzî  Mulakhkhas [2002]\n10.1–10.8; see now El-Rouayheb 2012: esp. 72–77 as to whether\nRâzî's clarification is ultimately compatible with\nAvicenna's). \nAvicenna in his Metaphysics makes special mention of\nthese secondary intelligibles. Text 5. The subject matter of logic, as\nyou know, is given by the secondary intelligible meanings, based on\nthe first intelligible meanings, with regard to how it is possible to\npass by means of them from the known to the unknown, not in so far as\nthey are intelligible and possess intellectual existence ([an\nexistence] which does not depend on matter at all, or depends on an\nincorporeal\nmatter).[21] \nIn identifying the secondary intelligibles, Avicenna is able to place\nlogic within the hierarchy of the sciences, because it has its own\ndistinct stretch of being which is its proper subject matter. \nSo much for the first problem in Alfarabi's formulation of what the\nsubject matter of logic is. Avicenna also has a view on the second\nproblem, the question of whether or not expression is essential to a\ndefinition of logic and its subject matter. Text 6. There is no merit in what some\nsay, that the subject matter of logic is speculation concerning the\nexpressions insofar as they signify meanings… And since the\nsubject matter of logic is not in fact distinguished by these things,\nand there is no way in which they are its subject matter, [such people]\nare only babbling and showing themselves to be\n stupid.[22] \nOne reason for this is that in Avicenna's psychology, language as a\nset of discrete expressions is not essential for the intellect in its\noperations. Note, however, that whatever Avicenna's official doctrine\nis, he recognizes and attempts to deal with the close nexus between\nlanguage and thought.  Text 7. Were it possible for logic to be\nlearned through pure cogitation, so that meanings alone would be\nobserved in it, then this would suffice. And if it were possible for\nthe disputant to disclose what is in his soul through some other\ndevice, then he would dispense entirely with its expression. But since\nit is necessary to employ expressions, and especially as it is not\npossible for the reasoning faculty to arrange meanings without\nimagining the expressions corresponding to them (reasoning being\nrather a dialogue with oneself by means of imagined expressions), it\nfollows that expressions have various modes (ahwâl) on\naccount of which the modes of the meanings corresponding to them in\nthe soul vary so as to acquire qualifications (ahkâm)\nwhich would not have existed without the expressions. It is for this\nreason that the art of logic must be concerned in part with\ninvestigating the modes of expressions… But there is no value\nin the doctrine of those who say that the subject matter of logic is\nto investigate expressions in so far as they indicate\nmeanings…but rather the matter should be understood in the way\nwe\n described.[23] \nAs Sabra says, Avicenna seems to hold that “the properties\nconstituting the subject matter of logic would be inconceivable without\nthe exercise of a particular function of language” (Sabra 1980:\n764). Avicenna's doctrine on the subject matter of logic was not adopted\nby the majority of logicians who followed him (pace Sabra 1980: 757).\nQuite the contrary, Khûnajî claimed in the second quarter\nof the thirteenth century that the subject matter of logic was\nconceptions and assents, a claim which was energetically resisted by\nremaining Avicennan purists like Tûsî. A recent study has\nclarified what is at issue in this debate (El-Rouayheb 2012).\n \nTo understand the background to Khûnajî's claim, it is\nnecessary to bear two points in mind. The first is Avicenna's doctrine\nconcerning the states of knowledge that logic aims at producing:\nconception and\n assent.[24]\nThe second is what is means for something\nto be a subject of an Aristotelian science.  Text 8. […] A thing is knowable in\ntwo ways: one of them is for the thing to be merely conceived\n(yutasawwara) so that when the name of the thing is uttered,\nits meaning becomes present in the mind without there being truth or\nfalsity, as when someone says “man” or “do\nthis!” For when you understand the meaning of what has been said\nto you, you will have conceived it. The second is for the conception\nto be [accompanied] with assent, so that if someone says to you, for\nexample, “every whiteness is an accident,” you do not only\nhave a conception of the meaning of this statement, but [also] assent\nto it being so. If, however, you doubt whether it is so or not, then\nyou have conceived what is said, for you cannot doubt what you do not\nconceive or understand… but what you have gained through\nconception in this [latter] case is that the form of this composition\nand what it is composed of, such as “whiteness” and\n“accident,” have been produced in the mind. Assent,\nhowever, occurs when there takes place in the mind a relating of this\nform to the things themselves as being in accordance with them; denial\nis the opposite of\n that.[25] \nNote that an assent is not merely the production of a proposition by\ntying a subject and predicate together; “Assent, however, occurs\nwhen there takes place in the mind a relating of this form to the\nthings themselves as being in accordance with them.” All\nknowledge, according to Avicenna, is either conception or\nassent. Conception is produced by definition, assent by proof. All\nAvicennan treatises on logic are structured in accordance with this\ndoctrine: a first section deals with definition, which conduces to\nconception, a second with proof, which conduces to assent. The subject of an Aristotelian science is investigated with a view\nto identifying its per se attributes, that is, its necessary but\nnon-constitutive properties. The subject of geometry is spatial\nmagnitude and its species (such as triangle); finding, for example,\nthat “internal angles summing to two right angles” belongs to\n“triangle” is the proper task of the science of geometry. If the\nsubject matter of logic is secondary intelligibles, then the proper\ntask of logic will be identifying the per se attributes of secondary\nintelligibles. According to Khûnajî, however, some of the\nproperties investigated by the logician are attributes of primary\nintelligibles; in consequence, the subject matter of logic must be\nsomething more general than secondary intelligibles.  This prompted\nKhûnajî to declare that conceptions and assents are the\nsubject matter of logic. Kâtibî accepted this line of\nreasoning: Text 9. The logician may investigate\nmatters that do not accrue to second intentions at all… but rather to\nsingle notions (ma’ânî)\nthat occur in the mind. For he investigates the concept of “essential”,\n“accidental”, “species”, “genus”, “differentia”, “subject” and\n“predicate” and other things that accrue to single notions that we\nintellect.[26] Another logician who followed Khûnajî in this\nwas Abharî; here is his statement\nof the doctrine:  Text 10. The subject matter of logic, I\nmean, the thing which the logician investigates in respect of its\nconcomitants in so far as it is what it is, are precisely conceptions\nand assents. [This is] because [the logician] investigates what\nconduces to conception and what the means [to conception] depends upon\n(for something to be universal and particular, essential and\naccidental, and such like); and he investigates what conduces to\nassent and what the means to assent depends upon, whether proximately\n(like something being a proposition or the converse of a proposition\nor the contradictory of a proposition and such like) or remotely (like\nsomething being a predicate or a subject). These are states which\ninhere in conceptions and assents in so far as they are what they are.\nSo certainly its subject matter is conceptions and assents.\n(Tûsî  Ta‘dîl [1974b] 144.14–20) \nAnd here is part of Tûsî's response:  \nText 11. If what he means by conceptions and assents\nis everything on which these two nouns fall, it is the sciences in\ntheir entirety, because knowledge is divided into these two; whereupon\nwhat is understood from [his claim] is that the subject matter of\nlogic is all the sciences. Yet there is no doubt that they are not the\nsubject matter of logic…  […] The truth is that the subject matter for logic is the secondary\nintelligibles in so far as reflection on them leads from the known to\n[understanding] the unknown (or to something similar, as do reductio\narguments or persuasive arguments [146] or image-evoking arguments and\nthe like). And if they are characterised by the rider mentioned by the\nmasters of this craft, conceptions and assents are among the set of\nsecondary intelligibles in just the same way as definition and\nsyllogism and their parts, like universal and particular and subject\nand predicate and proposition and premise and conclusion\n(Tûsî Ta‘dîl [1974b] 144.21–u,\n145.pu–146.3). But as we have seen, for Tûsî's colleagues at\nMaragha, Avicenna's\nidentification of secondary intelligibles as the subject matter of\nlogic excludes things which are properly\ninvestigated in logic. (I note but do not attempt to cover the\ncounter-arguments\noffered in the later tradition against Khûnajî's position;\nsee El-Rouayheb 2012: 82 et seq.) \nWhen the full Organon was finally assembled in Arabic, it\nincluded the whole range of texts in the order given them by the\nAlexandrian philosophers. There was an inherited expectation that this\nwas the full and proper stretch of logical inquiry, an expectation\nwhich was to come under pressure in the Muslim world. It had already\ncome under\nrevision in Avicenna's Pointers and Reminders, but more\nsubstantial change was to follow. \nOne factor at work in determining the structure of Avicennan logic\ntreatises was the doctrine of secondary intelligibles, a doctrine which\nled to the exclusion of parts of the Organon from the realm\nof the strictly logical, specifically, the Categories. The\narguments that excluded the Categories must also have\nproblematized the inclusion of some other parts of the Organon,\nsuch as the Topics. \nAnother factor at work was the doctrine of conceptions and assents.\nIf,\nas was commonly accepted, argument is designed to bring about an\nassent, then one might ask what kinds of assent there are, and what\nvariables in an argument lead to different kinds of assent. This\ndoctrine was to replace the Alexandrian doctrine of the context theory,\nin which logic is taken to cover different material implementations of\nsyllogistic reasoning, whether in demonstration, dialectic, rhetoric,\npoetics or sophistry. According to the Alexandrian version of the\ntheory, a stretch of discourse was to be analysed according to the\ncontext in which it was found: in poetry, one expected to find false\nand impossible statements, in demonstration, necessary and true\nstatements. The Arabic logicians were to reject this version, though\nthey ultimately lost interest in the range of disciplines coordinated\nby the theory. \nA final factor, or range of factors, at work on the shape of the\nlogic treatise that emerged in the thirteenth century arose out of\ndiscussions in law, especially the tradition of legal dialectic; this\ntradition was ultimately to crystallise as a new discipline that\nreplaced the discussion of the Topics and Sophistical\nFallacies. Similarly disciplines grew out of grammar and theology\nwhich replaced the logical study of rhetoric and poetics. I examine\neach of these factors in turn. \nAvicenna's doctrine of secondary intelligibles assigns logic a subject\nmatter whose essential properties the logician studies; this makes\nlogic a science in the Aristotelian sense of the term.\nBut—according to the strictures applying to an Aristotelian\nscience—no science can probe the existence of its subject\nmatter, but rather must take it as given from a higher science (in\nthis case, metaphysics). Yet the Categories shuttles between\nsecondary intelligibles and the primary intelligibles which are the\npre-condition for the existence of the secondary intelligibles. \nAvicenna himself adverted to the problem of whether or not Categories\nwas a properly logical book, and decided that it was not, though he\ntreated it in the Cure out of deference to Peripatetic\ncustom. His arguments for deeming it not to be properly logical have\nbeen gathered together in the past (see esp. Gutas 1988: 265–267), but\nthe line of argument had already been stated neatly by later logicians.\nHere is Hillî dealing with why Tûsî moves from the\nfive predicables (or “five categories”) to the ten\ncategories: Text 12. When Tûsî finished\ninvestigating the five categories which inhere in the ten categories,\nhe began the investigation of [the ten], even though [such\ninvestigation] is not part of logic. [This is] because the subject\nmatter of logic is the secondary intelligibles which inhere in the\nprimary intelligibles. How can the primary intelligibles be\ninvestigated even though [such investigation] is a [presupposed] part\nof the science [of logic]? This would be circular. But rather, [the\nten categories] are investigated in logic to aid in properly realizing\nthe genera and specific differences. [Such investigation], then, will\nbe a help in discovering (istinbât) what is defined and\ninferred, even though it is not part of logic (Hillî Jawhar [1410\nA.H.]  23.4–8). \nA study of the categories will, in short, be helpful in giving\nconcrete examples of the logical doctrines presented. The same\narguments in removing the Categories from logic should apply\nto texts which investigate the commonplace reasoning of\nthe Topics, though I have not seen such an argument made by\nan Arabic logician. It is not clear to me that the argument to exclude\nthe Categories from logic which, in Hillî's version,\ndepends on taking secondary intelligibles to be the subject matter of\nlogic, still works for those who do not accept logic's subject matter\nto be secondary intelligibles; none the less, the Categories\nwere excluded from their works too. \nArguments aim to bring about assent; more precisely\n (see Text 8 above), when conceptions have been gained that produce in the mind both\nthe meaning of the terms in a given proposition, and the form of\ncomposition of these terms, assent “occurs when there takes place\nin the mind a relating of this form to the things themselves as\nbeing in accordance with them…” In fact, different kinds\nof discourse can bring about one or other kind of assent, or something\nenough like assent to be included in a general theory of discourse. I\ngive Tûsî's statement of the Avicennan version of the\ncontext theory; it is the neatest statement I know of\nthe criteria that divide kinds of discourse and the assents for which\neach aims. \nA few preliminary words by way of introduction to this dense\npassage.\nArabic logicians, like most Aristotelian logicians, speak of form and\nmatter in propositions and proofs, and they have quite specific\ndistinctions in mind when they do so. The matter in a proposition is\nwhat underwrites as true or false the modality the proposition has.\nWhen the dummy variables in a proposition are filled in with concrete\nterms, the resulting claim may be semantically determinate (as in\n“every man is an animal” and “no man is a\nstone”), and this will make the proposition's matter either\nnecessary or remote and, if necessary, make the proposition true as a\nnecessity proposition. Alternatively, the resulting claim may be\nsemantically indeterminate (as in “every man is writing”),\nand this will make the proposition's matter contingent, and the\nproposition true as a contingency proposition. The matter in an\nargument, by contrast, is the epistemic status or persuasive force each\nof the premises has which, given a formally appropriate proof, will\nconfer a\nsimilar or lesser epistemic status or persuasive force on the\nconclusion. (Note that jâzim is rendered by Black as\n“apophantic” (Black 1990: 53), which I give here as\n“truth-apt”. For the terms of art used to deal with\nsyllogistic matter, see now Gutas (2012).) Text 13. Since Avicenna had finished\nexplaining the formal and quasi-formal aspects of syllogistic, he\nturned to its material aspects. With respect to these, syllogistic\ndivides into five kinds, because it either conveys an assent, or an\ninfluence of another kind (I mean an evoked image or wonder).\nWhat leads to assent leads either to an assent which is truth-apt or to\none which is not. And what is truth-apt is either taken\n[in the argument] as true (haqq), or is not so taken. And what\nis taken\nas true either is or isn't true.  That which leads to true truth-apt assent is [1] demonstration;\nuntrue truth-apt assent is [2] sophistry. That which leads to\ntruth-apt assent not taken as true or false but rather as [a matter\nof] common consent (‘umûm al-i‘tirâf)\nis—if it's like this—[3] dialectic (jadal),\notherwise it's eristic (shaghab) which is, along with\nsophistry (safsata), under one kind of fallacy production\n(mughâlata).  [And what leads] to overwhelming though\nnot truth-apt assent is [4] rhetoric; and to evocation of images\nrather than assent, [5] poetry (Tûsî Sharh\nal-Ishârât [1971] 460.1–461.12). \nTûsî immediately goes on to lay out grounds for assent to\npropositions, for example, because they are primary, or because they\nare agreed for the purposes of discussion. Propositions to be used as\npremises for demonstration make the most irresistible demands for our\nassent; premises for lower kinds of discourse make weaker demands. \nThe vast majority of the later Arabic logicians no more than nod\ntowards the\ncontext theory in a paragraph towards the end of their treatises. A\nlogician should only be interested—in so far as he is interested\nin material implementation of formal reasoning at all—in\ndemonstration because it leads him to what is true and certain, and in\nsophistry, because it may confuse him in the search for demonstrative\ntruth. \nPhilosophically, the context theory is an attempt to account for\nthe cognitive and communicative impact of every kind of discourse. It\nexamines in extraordinary detail the Aristotelian claim that the\nsyllogism lies at the heart of all human reasoning and, in an attempt\nto make good the claim, presents an account of syllogistic forms\nattenuated in accordance with the epistemic matter of their premises.\nIt also recognizes that communication depends on more than merely\nobjective truth and formal validity, and offers an account of what\nmotivates the assent of the human knower to any given stretch of\ndiscourse. As a theory, its global reach may be more impressive than\nits analytical grasp, but it is a marked advance on a theory only\npartly developed in the Alexandrian\n school.[27] \nThe doctrine of secondary intelligibles cut down the number of\nsubjects treated within the logic treatises, or at least, treated as\nstrictly logical subjects, and the doctrine of dividing knowledge into\nconception and assent determined the structure of what was left in\nAvicennan logic treatises. Formal interests of post-Avicennan logicians\nfurther limited interest in demonstration; syllogistic, for example,\nbecame a central focus of research from the thirteenth century on.\nFurther changes were introduced for clarity of exposition. Text 14. The later scholars came and\nchanged the technical terms of logic; and they appended to the\ninvestigation of the five universals its fruit, which is to say the\ndiscussion of definitions and descriptions which they moved from\nthe Posterior Analytics; and they dropped\nthe Categories because a logician is only accidentally and\nnot essentially interested in that book; and they appended to On\nInterpretation the treatment of conversion (even if it had been\nin the Topics in the texts of the ancients, it is none the\nless in some respects among the things which follow on from the\ntreatment of propositions). Moreover, they treated the syllogistic\nwith respect to its productivity generally, not with respect to its\nmatter. They dropped the investigation of [the syllogistic] with\nrespect to matter, which is to say, these five books: Posterior\nAnalytics, Topics, Rhetoric,\n  Poetics, and Sophistical\nFallacies (though sometimes some of them give a brief outline of\nthem). They have ignored [these five books] as though they had never\nbeen, even though they are important and relied upon in the discipline\n(Ibn-Khaldûn  Muqaddima [1858] 112–113; cf.\nIbn-Khaldûn 1958: 3, 142–143). \nIt is clear that whether the structure of the Organon was\nappropriate for Arabic logic treatises was contested at least until\nthe end of the thirteenth century. At the same time Hillî was\nsetting out his logic according to the Avicennan outline of\nthe Organon (see section 1.5.2 above), Shamsaddîn\nas-Samarqandî (d. c. 1310) was writing a book laid out\nafter the fashion described by Ibn Khaldûn in the text above,\nwith one major difference. Samarqandî concluded\nhis Qistâs al-Afkâr with a long section covering\nwhat he called “the etiquette of debate” and fallacies. He\nconsciously adopted the etiquette of debate from treatises on forensic\nargument, and he told his readers that he intended it to replace study\nof the Topics and the Sophistical Fallacies. Text 15. It has been the custom of our\npredecessors to place a chapter on dialectics (jadal) in\ntheir logical works. But since the science of juristic dialectic\n(khilâf) of our times does not need it, I have brought\nin its stead a canon for the art of disputation and its order, the\nproper formulation of speech [in disputation] and its\nrectification. This [art] is, with respect to establishing a thesis\nand explaining it, just like logic with respect to deliberation and\nthought; for, through it we are kept on the desired path and are saved\nfrom the recalcitrance of speech. I have set it out in two sections,\nthe first, on the ordering and etiquette of debate, the second, on\nerror and its\n causes.[28] In one sense, Samarqandî was unsuccessful: few if any later\nauthors followed him in making the etiquette of debate a section of\ntheir logic treatises. But in another, much more significant sense,\nSamarqandî was entirely successful; his work by and large\nsupplanted the Topics and\nSophistical Fallacies, and gained a place in the madrasa\nsystem along side Kâtibî's\nShamsiyya; treatises on the etiquette of debate are often found\nin codices along with the logic treatises. \nOther language sciences also went into the\ncodices with the logic manuals. Of the cluster of disciplines that make\nup the grammatical sciences, especially ‘ilm al-wad‘\n(roughly, semantics) and ‘ilm al-balâgha\n(roughly, rhetoric) compete to cover material covered by parts of\nAristotelian logic. Like the logic textbooks, the textbooks for both ‘ilm\nal-wad‘ and ‘ilm al-balâgha that were\nincorporated into a typical madrasa education were achieved fairly late. \n‘Ilm al-wad‘ was named and consecrated as a\nseparate discipline by the work of the great Ash‘arite\ntheologian, ‘Adudaddin al-Îjî (d. 1355). In\nhis Epistle on Imposition Îjî drew together the\nviews of his predecessors on the way language came about. All agreed\nthat language was the result of a conscious\nassignation—imposition—of units of vocal sound (or\nexpressions, alfâz) to units of thought (or\nmeanings, ma‘ânî). It made no difference\nwhat position one adopted on the origin of language, because either\nGod or the community could function as the one imposing language. Note\nthat the units of thought are at least logically prior to language, so\nlanguage is not considered a pre-condition of thought. Language is the\ntotality of expressions together with the totality of their\nmeanings. Once expressions have been assigned their meanings by the\nimpositor, this is irrevocable. Having stated these common assumptions\nabout language, Îjî turned to set out a typology of\nimposition.  Îjî noted that—in what he took to be\nunproblematic cases—the meaning in the mind of the one imposing\nthe expression is identical to the meaning it has in actual speech\nsituations. But what about the pronoun, “he”, which will\nhave a different meaning in different speech situations? This is the\nproblem on which Îjî dwelt in his epistle. Its solution\nturned out to be, as Tashköprüzade was later to say, only a\ndrop in the ocean of problems in ‘ilm al-wad‘;\nonce one took the notion of imposition seriously, implementing it as a\ngeneral explanation for the relation between expression and meaning\nturned out to be an immense project which carried on into the\ntwentieth century (Weiss 1987: especially 341–345). \n‘Ilm al-balâgha was standardly presented in a\ntextbook by Khatîb Dimashq al-Qazwînî (d. 1325),\nThe Abridgement of the Key. ‘Ilm\nal-balâgha was a science that includes a deal of material\nderiving from the work of the great eleventh-century grammarian and\nAsh‘arite theologian, ‘Abdalqâhir\nal-Jurjânî (d. 1078). Spurred by debate about how to\njudge the inimitability of the Koran, Jurjânî had tried to\ndevelop a method for evaluating rhetorical excellence. \n \nThe basic\ntenet he wishes to emphasize from the outset is that stylistic\nsuperiority resides in the meanings or ideas\n(ma‘ânî) of words and how they are\nassociated with each other in a given composition (nazm), and\nnot in the utterances or words (alfâz) themselves.\n(Larkin 1982: 77)  There were a number of modal systems developed and debated among\nthe Arabic logicians. The material devoted to the topic is too\nvoluminous for anything more than a sketchy account of one line of\ndevelopment and debate. I follow a few aspects of Avicenna's\nsyllogistic through its treatment in the thirteenth century, and its\ntransformation into a compact body of doctrine taught in the\nmadrasa. With regret, in this redaction of the entry I omit mention of\nAlfarabi and Averroes, not because they are not important, but\nbecause, first, Alfarabi's most important treatment of the syllogistic\nis lost and, secondly, Averroes stands outside the Avicennan tradition\nof logic. \nIt will become clear that Avicenna's syllogistic puzzled those who\ncame after him, and still puzzles those today who try to work out what\nAvicenna was doing. There is some ground to think that Avicenna's\nsyllogistic is, from a systematic point of view, something of a\nfailure; that was a fairly common assessment among thirteenth-century\nlogicians. This in turn gives rise to the thought that perhaps\nAvicenna wasn't trying to produce a systematic syllogistic, that he\nhad other goals in mind as he dealt with material descended ultimately\nfrom Aristotle's Prior Analytics (some of it, from the\ncommentators, seemingly in conflict with what Aristotle is doing). If\nI understand correctly, this is broadly speaking how Hodges approaches\nAvicenna (see Hodges 2011b, 2012a, and 2012b in\n Other Internet Resources).\nOn the other hand, it may be that Avicenna has a complex system that\nrepays close analysis; Thom's studies of Avicenna's syllogistic\nproceed on that assumption. I tend to think the Thom approach is the\nmore promising. In any event, thirteenth-century logicians took\nAvicenna to have tried and failed to present a coherent system. \nIn this brief overview, I describe one aspect of Avicenna's\ntruth-conditions for modal propositions which became common doctrine\namong later Arabic logicians. I go on to examine some of what Avicenna\nsaid about the subject term of a proposition, and some of the\ninferences he defended. Avicenna's doctrines on both subject term and\nmodal inferences became much-debated issues in thirteenth-century\nlogic; I follow one line of the debate. \nIn a famous and much-quoted passage, Avicenna lays out six conditions\nunder which a proposition may be said to have a given modalization\n(all his examples are of necessity propositions, but the same\nconditions apply to propositions under all modalizations); the first\ntwo conditions are the most important: Text 16. Necessity may be absolute\n(‘alâ l-itlâq), as in God exists;\n[265] or it may be connected (mu‘allaqa) to a condition\n(shart).  The condition is either [1] perpetual [relative] to\nthe existence of the substance [of the subject] (dhât),\nas in man is necessarily a rational body; by which we do not\nmean to say that man is and always will be a rational body, because\nthis is false taken for each human individual. Rather we mean that\nwhile he exists as a substance (mâ dâma mawjûda\ndh-dhât) as a human, he is a rational body.  Likewise for\nevery negative which resembles this affirmative statement.  Or [the condition may be] [2] the duration (dawâm)\nof the subject's being described with what is set down with it, as in all\nmobile things are changing; this is not to be taken to mean [this\nis so] absolutely, nor while the subject exists as a substance, but\nrather while the substance of the moving thing is moving. [266]  Distinguish between this condition and the first condition,\nbecause the first condition has set down [as the condition] the\nprinciple of the substance, man, whereas here the substance is set\ndown with a description which attaches to the substance, moving thing;\nthe moving thing has a substance and an essence (jawhar) to\nwhich movement and non-movement attach; but man and black are not like\nthat (Avicenna Ishârât [1971] 264–266). \nAvicenna takes a proposition under condition [1]—later\ntermed, for obvious reasons, the dhâtî—to\nbe the right proposition to use while laying out the system Aristotle\nshould have laid out in the Prior Analytics, and for laying\nout the central claims of his own metaphysics. Avicenna focussed most\nof his attention on the dhâtî, and when he looked\nfor the strongest converse of a dhâtî\nproposition, he ignored wasfî converses. Later\nlogicians approached the issue of wasfî/dhâtî\nconditions differently, and often found wasfî converses\nfor dhâtî propositions; they had integrated the\ntwo readings in a way Avicenna had not. Avicenna stipulated for the subject term of all his\npropositions, whether explicitly modalized or not: Text 17. Know that when we say every\nJ is B, we do not mean the totality (kulliyya)\nof J is the totality of B. Rather, we mean that\nevery single thing described as J, be it in mental\nsupposition or extramental existence, be it described as J\nalways, or sometimes, or whatever; that thing is described\nas B without further adding that it is so described at such\nand such a time (waqt), or in such and such circumstances\n(hâl), or perpetually. All of these [modalizations\nwould make for a proposition] stronger than one being described as\nabsolute (mutlaq). So this is what is understood\nfrom every J is B, with no addition of modal operators\nattached. On this understanding it is called a general\nabsolute… (Avicenna\n Ishârât [1971] 280 &\n282). The phrase “be it in mental supposition” might be taken\nto mean that the subject term is ampliated to the possible, so that\n“every J is B” is to be taken as\n“every possible J is B.” This is how\nFakhraddiin al-Râzî understood Avicenna (and two recent\nmodels for Avicenna's syllogistic ampliate the subject term; Thom\n2003, 2008b). Avicenna gave a number of accounts of modal propositions and\nsyllogisms. Here, I follow a few points made in the one given\nin Pointers and Reminders, the cynosure of thirteenth-century\nlogicians (though I also refer to Salvation which,\nlike Pointers, is available in English\ntranslation). Avicenna's syllogistic includes propositions without\nexplicit modalization (an absolute proposition, taken by Avicenna to\ncontain an elided temporal modality “at least once”, so the\na-proposition is understood as “every J is at least once B”, the\ne-proposition as “no J is always B”) both one- and two-sided,\npossibility propositions both one-sided (“every J is possibly B”) and\ntwo-sided, and necessity propositions (“every J is necessarily\nB”,  e-proposition “no J is possibly B”). Early in his presentation, Avicenna considered whether the absolute\ne-proposition, “no J is B”, converts to\n“no B is J” (a conversion accepted by his\npredecessors and contemporaries). Avicenna rejected absolute\ne-conversion and offered a counter-example found in Aristotle,\n“no horse is sleeping” (Avicenna Najât [1985] 39), and\none of his own, “no man is laughing” (Avicenna\nIshârât [1971] 322). He accepted that absolute a- and\ni-propositions convert: (1) “Every J is B” and “some J is\nB” convert to “some B is J.”\n He offered an ecthetic proof for the conversion (Avicenna\n Ishârât [1971] 330; Avicenna\nNajât  [1985] 44). And he proved the conversion of the\nnecessity e-proposition: (2) “No J is possibly B” converts\nto “no B is possibly J.”\n Text 18.  The universal negative\nnecessity proposition converts as itself, that is, as a universal\nnegative necessity. If necessarily no B is A, then\nnecessarily no A is B; were that not the case, then\npossibly a given A is B—let that be J, such\nthat at a given moment what has become A will have become B, so\nthat it will be B and A, so that that B is an\nA; this is impossible. (Avicenna Najât [1985]\n44–45)  Avicenna shifted on whether the necessity a- and i-propositions\nconvert to absolute i-propositions (Avicenna\nNajât [1985] 45), or to possibility i-propositions; his\nlater position is that they convert as possibility i-propositions\n(Avicenna  Ishârât [1971]\n335–336). (3) “Every J is necessarily B”\nand “some J is necessarily B” convert to\n“some B is possibly J.” Avicenna rejected the conversion of the possibility e-proposition\n(“no J is necessarily B”) with the same\ncounter-example used to reject absolute e-conversion (“no man is\nnecessarily laughing”). And he argued for the conversion of the\npossibility a- and i-propositions as i-propositions: (4) “Every J is possibly B”\nand “some J is possibly B” convert to\n“some B is possibly J.” Text 19.  If “every J is\npossibly B” or “some J is possibly\nB”, then “some B is possibly J”\n(as a one-sided possibility proposition); were that not the case, then\nno B is possibly J, which as you know amounts to\n“necessarily no B is J”, which converts to\n“necessarily no J is B”; this is\nabsurd. (Avicenna Ishârât [1971]\n339ff.) Notice that the proof for necessity e-conversion depends on\npossibility i-conversion, and the proof for possibility i-conversion\non necessity e-conversion. Alternative proofs could be proposed; for\ne-conversion, for example, one could argue that “no J is\npossibly B” converts to “no B is possibly\nJ”, if not, then “some B is possibly\nJ”, but this with the first proposition produces by Ferio\n“some J is not possibly J”, which is\nabsurd. This proof is open to Avicenna, given that he took\nfirst-figure syllogisms with a possibility proposition as its minor\npremise to be perfect, or nearly so; this syllogistic mix was rejected\nby most later logicians, along with the other proofs. By and large, logicians who came after Avicenna adopted many of his\nassumptions and distinctions: his understanding of the absolute\nproposition (at least with respect to the modalization of its\npredicate), the wasfî/dhâtî\ndistinction, the division of the syllogistic into repetitive and\nconnective. They worried, however, about a number of his claims\nconcerning modal propositions and the productive syllogisms that can\nbe built from them. By the middle of the thirteenth century, a primary\nconcern was about finding truth-conditions for propositions that could\nbe useful for the sciences (see Text 24 below),\nthough everyone started from Avicenna's formulations. A central\ndistinction in these later discussions was between externalist and\nessentialist readings of the propositions. This is what the terms\n“externalist” and “essentialist” mean: Text 20.  “Every J\nis B” is considered at times according to the essence\n(whereupon it's called “essentialist”, as though [the\nsubject] is an essence in a proposition used in the sciences), and at\nother times according to external reality (whereupon it's called\n“externalist”, and what is meant by “external”\nis what is external to the senses).  (Tahtânî\n1948: Tahrîr 94.6–8) Fakhraddîn al-Râzî was the first to introduce the\ndistinction between externalist and essentialist readings (see notes\nto Râzî 2002: at 400). When we say “every J\nis B”, Text 21.  …we don't mean by it\nwhat is described as J externally, but rather something more\ngeneral, which is: were it to exist externally it would be true of it\nthat it is J, whether it exists externally or not. For we can say\n“every triangle is a figure” even if there are no\ntriangles existent externally. The meaning is rather that everything\nwhich would be a triangle were it to exist would be—in so far as\nit existed—a figure. (Râzî Mulakhkhas\n[2002] 141.6–10) […] By the second reading, we mean by “every J”\nevery single thing which exists externally among the\nindividual Js… On this hypothesis, were there no\nseptagons existent externally, it wouldn't be correct to say\n“every septagon is a figure”; if the only figures existent\nexternally were triangles, it would be correct to say “every\nfigure is a triangle.” On the first reading, both of these would\nbe false. (Râzî Mulakhkhas [2002]\n142.13–143.1) Râzî went on to investigate inferences in both\nreadings,\nand found the inferences from propositions with essentialist readings\nlined up closely with Avicenna's. The readings gave Râzî\nall the conversions mentioned in \nsection 2.3.1 above except 1 (he took\nthe absolute\naffirmative to convert as a possibility proposition). He also accepted\nsyllogisms with possibility propositions as minor premises to be\nproductive. Interpretive considerations may have been at play in his\nclear preference for the essentialist reading, but what explicitly\nmotivated the distinction is the need to have propositions refer to\nthings which do not exist “externally”; the examples are always of\nnon-instantiated geometric figures. Râzî was clear that he did not intend the essentialist\nreading to amount to an ampliation of the subject term to the possible\nsuch as he attributed to Alfarabi (“Alfarabi claimed that with\nrespect to ‘every J’ one shouldn't [only] take\naccount of actually occurring Js, but everything whose\ndescription as J is possible”; Râzî\nMulakhkhas [2002] 142.4–5).  But with the phrase\n“were it to exist externally it would be true of it that it is\nJ”, Râzî posited a domain of discourse\nincluding non-instantiated Js, and he seemed to take his\npropositions thereby to refer to possible-Js. That at least is how Khûnajî understood\nRâzî's solution; he took it to amount to no more than an\nampliation of the subject term to the possible. Unlike\nRâzî, Khûnajî understood the phrase\n“were it to exist as a J” to include reference to\nimpossible Js, and modified or rejected the conversions 1, 2, 3\nand 4.  Before turning to how Khûnajî used the\nessentialist reading, consider his assessment of Râzî's\nreading at the end of the chapter on conversion in\nDisclosure. Text 22. Know\nthat these valuations relating to conversion which we have mentioned\ndon't differ much from the claims of the ancients, even though they\nmay differ from what some recent logicians have said. Were we to be\nsatisfied, as Alfarabi was, that for something to be a subject the\npossibility [of its coming under the subject term would be enough],\nand not consider [the subject term's] affirmation of it in actuality,\nit would follow that the [universal] negative necessity proposition\nwould convert as a necessity proposition, affirmative possibility\npropositions would convert as a possibility proposition, the\nconversion of absolute propositions wouldn't result in more than\npossibility, and the syllogism in the first figure with a minor\npossibility proposition would be productive, as will be clear to you\nafter coming to know what has gone before, and having given due\nconsideration to the propositions under this technical usage. Since\nthe later scholars have changed the technical usage without changing\nthe valuations they arrive at—such that the valuation differs\naccordingly to the difference in technical usage—, they have\nbeen mired in nonsense. Perhaps Avicenna hesitated over the conversion\nof absolute propositions as either possibility or absolute\npropositions just because of his hesitation over technical usage. When\nhe says that they convert as possibility propositions, he doesn't\nconsider affirmation in actuality with respect to the subject; when he\nsays they convert as absolute propositions, he does (because the fact\nthe absolute follows on this technical usage is just about patently\nevident, such that it wouldn't be appropriate for Avicenna to deny\nit).  (Khûnajî Kashf [2010]\n145.3-u) Having rejected Râzî's understanding of the\nessentialist reading, Khûnajî deployed his own modified\nessentialist reading to come to different inferences. Take absolute\ne-conversion, which Avicenna and Râzî agreed fails\n(according to Râzî, it fails on either externalist or\nessentialist reading). Khûnajî agreed that it fails on the\nexternalist reading (which he took in the same way Râzî\ndid). Taken in Khûnajî's essentialist reading, however,\n“no J is always B” converts as a perpetuity\no-proposition, “some B is never J.” To show\nthis is so, Khûnajî had to offer a proof for the\nconversion, then resist counter-examples to it. I skip the proof, and\ngo straight to how Khûnajî dealt with the\ncounter-examples.\n Text 23. They argue\nconversion fails for these propositions because it is true, “no\nmoon is eclipsed”…and “no animal is\nbreathing”… yet [130] their converses are not true,\nnamely, “some eclipsed is not a moon”, and “some\nbreathing is not animal”… The answer to this is that we reject that “some eclipsed is\nnot a moon” and similar statements are false if the subject is\ntaken according to the essentialist reading. This is because, in this\ncase, its meaning is some of what would be eclipsed, were it to come\nto exist, would not be a moon, insofar as it had come to exist. [The\nclaim this is false] is to be rejected; the most that can be said in\nthis matter is that every eclipsed that has come to exist is a moon,\nbut from this is does not follow that it is true that everything that\nis eclipsed, were it to come to exist, would be a moon insofar as it\ncomes to exist. This is because [the proposition with an essentialist\nsubject] deals with actual, possible and impossible items [that come\nunder the subject term]. Were we to stipulate the possibility [of\nthese items] along with [the other stipulations], their status would\nbe that of externally existent things. So the\neclipsed-which-is-not-a-moon, even though it is impossible, is among\nthose individuals which would be eclipsed, were they to come to exist,\neven though it is not necessary that any would be a moon if they came\nto exist. Overall, if these propositions\nare taken\nin the essentialist reading, the proof we have given for their\nconversion works, the counter-arguments are not compelling, and the\nproper view must be that the conversion is correct.\n(Khûnajî Kashf [2010] 129.14–130.12) What this means for the counter-example considered before, “no man\nis always laughing”, is that it converts on this account to “some\nlaughing is not ever a man.” This is because we may, under\nKhûnajî's essentialist reading, posit the impossible\n“laughing-which-is-not-a-man.” With this modified essentialist\nreading, Khûnajî ended up with the following\nconversions: The Maragha logicians—whose work included the compositions\non logic\nmost frequently taught in the Islamic world—reflected critically on\nAvicenna, Râzî and Khûnajî. Everyone accepted\nthat there were problems with Avicenna's inferences, but also that\nKhûnajî's critique of Râzî's essentialist\nreading (which had saved most of Avicenna's inferences) was correct.\nKhûnajî's alternative development of the essentialist\nreading led to its own problems, however; first Abarî proved that\nan e-proposition couldn't be true on Khûnajî's version of\nthis reading, then Tûsî proved, nor could an a-proposition.\nBy the time Kâtibî came to deal with the problem, he took\nKhûnajî's comment in Text 23 above seriously:  …the proposition with an\nessentialist subject] deals with actual,\npossible and impossible items [that come under the subject term]. Were\nwe to stipulate the possibility [of these items] along with [the\nother stipulations], their status would be that of externally existent\nthings. Kâtibî further modified Khûnajî's\nreading to\nlimit propositions with essentialist subjects to those with\nself-consistent subjects. In the Shamsiyya,\nin consequence, the externalist and essentialist readings are taken to\nbe of the same status, which is to say, all and only the inferences\nprovable in one reading are provable in the other. On the conversions\nin question, Kâtibî held:  Tahtânî, writing in the early fourteenth century,\nlooked back over the efforts of his thirteenth-century predecessors\nand summed up the nature of their inquiries. If his account is\ncorrect, the thirteenth-century logicians limited their investigations\nto scientifically useful propositions, acknowledging at the same time\nthat there are many other propositions with different truth-conditions\nthey could be investigating. Text 24. It is\nnot to be leveled as a criticism that, because the craft should have\ngeneral rules, there are propositions that cannot be taken under\neither of these two considerations (namely, those whose subjects are\nimpossible, as in “the co-creator is impossible”, and\n“every impossible is non-existent”).  Because we say: No\none claims to limit all propositions to the essentialist and the\nexternalist. They do however claim that propositions used in the\nsciences are used for the most part under one of these two\nconsiderations, so they therefore set these readings down and extract\ntheir qualifications so they may thereby benefit in the sciences. The\nqualifications of the propositions that cannot be taken under either\nof these two considerations are not yet known; the generalization of\nrules is only to the extent of human capacity.
