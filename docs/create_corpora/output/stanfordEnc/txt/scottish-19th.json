The principal figures are Thomas Brown, Sir William\nHamilton, James Frederick Ferrier and Alexander Bain, and later in the\ncentury, the so-called “Scottish Idealists” notably James\nHutchison Stirling, Edward Caird, and D.G. Ritchie. The\nself-conscious identity of the Scottish philosophical tradition owes\nmuch to James McCosh, a Scottish born and educated philosopher who\nbecame President of the College of New Jersey, later Princeton\nUniversity,and straddling the 19th and 20th centuries, Andrew Seth\nPringle Pattison.\n\nWhile the Scottish philosophers of the 18th century are\nstudied extensively, the philosophers who worked in Scotland's\nuniversities during the 19th century are generally\nneglected, and in many cases virtually unknown. Francis Hutcheson,\nDavid Hume and Thomas Reid and are names familiar to almost all\nphilosophers; Sir William Hamilton, James Frederick Ferrier, Alexander\nBain, Edward Caird and Andrew Seth to very few. Yet it is in the 19th\ncentury that something called “Scottish philosophy” came\nto consciousness, and gained an honored place in the international\nacademy of its day. Across Europe and North America, and even in\nAustralasia, for most of the 19th century Scottish philosophy was held\nin very high regard.It was only with the turn of the 20th century that\nits star fell, and did so surprisingly rapidly. To understand this\ndecline in reputation, it is necessary to see 19th century\nScottish philosophy against the background of the century that\npreceded it. \nAccording to George Davie there is an \nCast in these terms it is easy to place the two most famous\nphilosophers of the Scottish Enlightenment on either side of the\ndivide. On the side of the first is Hume, whose skeptical conclusions\narise from the Berkeleyan presupposition asserted in the very first\nsentence of his Treatise of Human Nature: \nOn the other side is Thomas Reid, for whom the errors of Hume result\nfrom the boldness of his starting point. \nThe problem as Reid saw it was that a highly theoretical philosophy\nwas trying to run before it could walk, because in sharp contrast to\nsubjects that are “really sciences”—mechanics,\nastronomy and optics are the examples he gives— \nIt is well known that, on Reid's analysis, Hume's skepticism derives\nin large part from his implicit subscription to the “way of\nideas”, a conception of knowledge and experience that finds its\norigins in Descartes, Malebranche and Locke, and its most dramatic\nexposition in Berkeley who, though no skeptic, “proved by\nunanswerable arguments what no man in his senses could believe”\n(Reid 1997, 20). The antidote to such skepticism is common sense, but\nnot of the robust sort displayed by Dr. Johnson when he purported to\nrefute Berkeley by kicking a stone. “Common sense” can\nmean two things, in fact: widespread popular conviction on the one\nhand, or on the other, the basic principles at work in human reasoning\nand belief formation. Widespread conviction can be false, of course,\nwhich is why the method of the School of Common Sense was thought\nsuspect by many, described by Kant, for example, as a stratagem by\nwhich “the stalest windbag can confidently take up with the\nsoundest thinker” (Kant 1783, 259]). But in Reid at any\nrate, philosophical inquiry into the human mind is not a matter of\nmaking popular opinion the test of truth, but of initiating a\n“dialogue between the vulgar and the learned” (to repeat\nDavie's happy phrase) in which proper weight is attached to actual\nminds at work. \nThere is, then, this deep division within the philosophy of the\nScottish Enlightenment, yet it occurs within a context of striking\nunanimity also. “Wise men now agree, or ought to agree in this,\nthat there is but one way to the knowledge of nature's works; the way\nof observation and experiment” Reid writes (Reid 1764, 11),\nthereby endorsing the express intention of Hume to “introduce\nthe experimental method of reasoning into moral subjects” (the\nsubtitle of the Treatise). Both remarks reflect a commitment\nto the project of a “science of mind”, a project common to\nall the major Scottish philosophers of the period. Thus George\nTurnbull (Reid's teacher) writing in 1740 says “I was led long\nago to apply myself to the study of the human mind in the same way as\nto that of the human body” (quoted in Davie 1994, 24) \nIn short, both division and unanimity are present within eighteenth\ncentury Scottish philosophy, unanimity with respect to aim—a\nscience of mind—and division with respect to method—the\n“principles of common sense” versus “the way of\nideas”. This is a tension, however, within only one part of\n18th century Scottish philosophy, namely the philosophy of\nsensation and perception, and not perhaps the most influential part.\nThe Scottish Enlightenment is in many ways more marked by the type of\nthinking about social and political topics that we find in Adam Smith\nand Adam Ferguson, as well as Hume, who in this respect take their cue\nfrom Hutcheson. The example par excellence is Smith's\nTheory of Moral Sentiments (1759; 6th edition\n1790), where the Humean ambition of countering the “books of\ndivinity and abstruse metaphysics” (Treatise) was\nfurthered by a sympathetic attention to how human beings in society\nactually are, and what social forms and political arrangements will\nbest work to their happiness and well being. \nIn the 19th century, this strand of Enlightenment thinking\nceased to be an important part of the philosophical agenda. That\nagenda was dominated, rather, by the “science of mind”\nmore narrowly conceived, that is to say logic (i.e., the philosophy of\ntruth and reason) and the philosophy of perception. \nFrom 1810 onwards, when Thomas Brown (1778–1820) took up the\nChair of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh, the story of Scottish\nphilosophy is that of repeated attempts to resolve the tension that\nlay within that “science of mind”. It is also a story of\nremarkable institutional continuity. Brown was a student of Dugald\nStewart (1753–1828), who in turn was a student and friend of\nReid and, having taught briefly at Glasgow, held the Chair of Moral\nPhilosophy at Edinburgh. This continuity was sustained throughout most\nof the succeeding century as the students of Scottish professors\nthemselves became Scottish professors, often moving between the four\nancient universities. This was especially notable in the case of the\nLogic Chair in Edinburgh, where Hamilton was succeeded by Campbell\nFraser, Fraser by Andrew Seth, and Seth by Norman Kemp Smith, a\nsuccession of professor/student stretching from 1836–1945. \nStewart was enormously highly thought of in his own day, and had a\nEuropean-wide reputation. At the time of his death he was described as\n‘the pride and ornament of Scotland’, and a striking\nmonument to him was erected on Edinburgh's Calton Hill. Yet in\nretrospect Stewart's thought continued the framework established by\nthe 8th century Scots, and arguably made no notably innovative\ncontribution to the central debate in Scottish philosophy. It was\nBrown who took Scottish philosophy into a new phase. \nBrown was a poet and physician as well as a philosopher, and a rather\nmore independent thinker than Stewart, so much so, in fact, that\nStewart regarded him as something of a traitor to the philosophy of\nReid. Perhaps because of his medical background, Brown was sympathetic\nto Humean empiricism, and to a large extent endorsed both Hume's\nrejection of metaphysics and his associationist psychology. Brown's\nfirst book, published in 1798 at the early age of twenty, was a set of\nObservations on the Zoonomia of Erasmus Darwin. His premature\ndeath in 1820 meant that he published relatively little philosophy\nduring his life time, though his Inquiry into the Relation of Cause\nand Effect revealed his sympathy for Hume. At the time of his\ndeath he left behind voluminous lectures that were posthumously\npublished. In them he was critical of Reid, though on certain issues\nhe may be said to have sided with Reid against Hume. In his most\nfrequently quoted remark, however, which does not come from the\nlectures, he famously sought to diminish the distance between the\ntwo. \nBrown's lectures were immensely popular with students, and on\npublication they were rapturously received and widely read, running\nthrough a great many editions, both in Britain and America, for\nseveral decades. Despite this popularity, after 1850 or so, they fell\ninto total neglect. This may have been because Brown's qualified\nchampionship of Hume sat rather uncomfortably with the consensus among\nScottish philosophers for most of the nineteenth century. Consequently\nthe greatest contribution that his lectures made to philosophical\ndebate was second hand – namely the re-interpretation and defence of\nReid that they induced on the part of the most prominent philosopher\nof the period—Sir William Hamilton. \nSir William Hamilton was a graduate of the Universities of Glasgow and\nOxford. At Glasgow he studied logic and moral philosophy under George\nJardine and James Mylne. Though neither published anything of\nsignificance, they both transmitted to a new generation the\nphilosophical legacy of Reid – though not uncritically. Mylne in\nparticular seems to have viewed Reid with detachment. In 1807 at\nBalliol College Oxford Hamilton held the Snell Exhibition, a\nscholarship that regularly allowed Scottish students of philosophy to\nspend time at England's oldest university, and though he found the\nintellectual life there uninspiring compared to Edinburgh, he gained\nan extensive knowledge of Aristotelianism . From 1811–21 he\nworked at the Scottish Bar (with limited success) until being\nappointed Professor of Universal and Civil History at the University\nof Edinburgh, where he transferred to the Chair of Logic and\nMetaphysics in 1836, a post he held until his death in 1856. \nAt the height of his powers, Hamilton was regarded as a major\nintellectual figure of international importance. In a memoir, Noah\nPorter, President of Yale, records that in America Hamilton “was\nregarded as the greatest writer and teacher among living Englishmen\n[sic!]”. Further evidence of this towering stature lies in the\nfact that a volume on Hamilton was included in the series\nPhilosophical Classics, edited by William Knight, Professor\nof Moral Philosophy at St Andrews. The inclusion ranked him alongside\nDescartes, Berkeley, Locke, Kant and Hegel. Such an estimation must\nnow strike us as strange, yet there is point in asking why his times\nregarded him in such a favorable light. The answer has several\nsources. First there was his personal charisma and enormous\nerudition—‘possibly the most learned Scot that ever\nlived’ according to Alexander Campbell Fraser, his successor in\nthe Chair at Edinburgh. Secondly, (as Porter records) by the early\n19th century, a measure of intellectual exhaustion had set in in\nphilosophical circles, and this provided a ready audience for his\nvigorous style of writing. Thirdly, there was his almost unique\nknowledge of German philosophy. Thanks to two trips he made to Germany\nduring his years as a lawyer, Hamilton acquired an extensive knowledge\nof Kant and his immediate successors, little of which had been\ntranslated into English but which Hamilton was able to read in the\noriginal language. At the same time, he was not only thoroughly versed\nin the Scottish tradition of philosophy that he had acquired from\nJardine and Mylne, but an enthusiastic exponent of Reid, whose\ncollected works he edited and annotated extensively. He was thus\nperfectly placed to broaden the horizons of Scottish philosophy, to\npush it beyond the narrower confines of Common Sense by bringing to\nwider attention the importance of Kant, while doing so as one\nprofoundly sympathetic to the native tradition. It is precisely for\nthese reasons, in fact, that he is praised by John Veitch in the\nPhilosophical Classics volume devoted to his philosophy. \nHamilton's published relatively little during his lifetime, and though\ntwo volumes of lectures appeared after his death, his philosophical\nviews can be adequately ascertained from three long essays that he\nwrote for the Edinburgh Review—“The Philosophy of\nthe Unconditioned” (1829), “The Philosophy of\nPerception” (1830) and “Logic” (1833), subsequently\nrepublished in a collection of his papers. In the first of these\nHamilton recounts the course philosophy had taken in France after\n“the philosophy of Descartes and Malebranche had sunk into\noblivion” (Hamilton 1853, 2). It began with the emergence of a\nhighly materialist version of Lockean empiricism “a doctrine so\nmelancholy in its consequences, and founded on principles thus partial\nand exaggerated, [that it] could not be permanent” (ibid., 3).\nRescue came from two sources. The first of these was the Scottish\nPhilosophy of Common Sense which showed that there are mental\nphenomena that cannot be interpreted as any form of sensation and that\n“intelligence supposes principles, which, as conditions\nof its activity, cannot be the results of its\noperation” (ibid., 3 emphasis original). The other source of\nrenewal was German philosophy after Kant, and in particular the\nAbsolute Idealism that was “founded by Fichte, but evolved by\nSchelling” (ibid., 6). “The Philosophy of the\nUnconditioned” is ostensibly a review of Victor Cousin's Course\nde Philosophie, which had been published in Paris the previously year\n(1828), but the ‘review’ is chiefly important in its\nproviding an occasion for Hamilton to formulate his own solution to\nthe tension between the philosophy of common sense and the way of\nideas. \nThe question at issue can be expressed in a number of different ways.\nKant held that we can only have knowledge of phenomena, never of\nnoumena or things in themselves. Clearly this version of\nphenomenalism, though in many ways the antithesis of empiricism, has\nelements in common with the “way of ideas” to which Reid\nobjected, which holds that the mind apprehends the world indirectly,\nthrough “impressions”. The alternative position, referred\nto in the 19th century as “presentationism” is\noften called “direct realism” and holds, as Reid contends,\nthat we directly apprehend the world of real things. Both positions\nhave their difficulties. Those who followed Kant, notably Fichte and\nSchelling, sought to escape the “scandal” of unknowable\nthings-in-themselves, and those who followed Reid sought to overcome\nthe contention implicit in his approach that our knowledge of the\nworld is “conditioned” by the principle of common sense.\nHence the pursuit of a philosophy of the\n“unconditioned”. \nHamilton argues that the age-old search for a philosophy of the\nunconditioned is futile, and he contends that what is in effect a\ncombination of phenomenalism and presentationism will supply\neverything that a properly grounded understanding of reality requires.\nIn “The Philosophy of Perception” he engages in the debate\nby defending Reid against criticisms in Thomas Brown's posthumously\npublished Lectures, and in a very vigorous\nmanner—“It is always unlucky to stumble on the threshold.\nThe paragraph (Lect. xxvii) in which Dr Brown opens his attack on Reid\ncontains more mistakes than sentences” (ibid. 69). Brown claimed\nthat a close analysis of Reid's writings showed that his position on\nperception was not really that of direct realism but\n“hypothetical realism”, that is the belief in an external\nworld that cannot be known directly. It is this contention that\nHamilton aims to refute, but it is arguable that he misinterprets\nBrown. Moreover in his notes to Reid's Collected Works, which\nwere composed rather later, he appears to come round to something very\nlike Brown's interpretation and to hold that Reid was not, strictly\nspeaking, a direct realist after all. \nIf we construe Reid as holding that in the act of perception there are\nthree elements—the physiological modification of the organ, a\nmental sensation and the perception of an object—then we can\ncontrast this with Hamilton's position which holds that the mental\nsensation and the perception are simultaneous and in a sense two sides\nof the same coin. Reid holds, of course, that we do not reason from\nsensation to perception; the apprehending mind moves from one to the\nother by a natural, inbuilt instinct—one of the principles of\ncommon sense. Hamilton too holds that there is no reasoning process\nhere, but he also thinks that the continuing division that Reid is\nemploying between sensation and perception is incompatible with the\nidea of immediate perception or direct realism. Hence his amendment,\nwhich so to speak ties the sensation and perception together. But how\nis this further contention to be sustained? Is it a conceptual truth\nof some kind, or an empirical observation about how the mind works?\nHamilton's writings in general tend to assertion more than argument,\nand while he has a great deal to say on this point, it does seem that\nhis “solution” to the problem of perception is an\narbitrary stipulation designed to overcome it. At any rate, if we do\npress the question of its defence, we quickly encounter a new version\nof the old division, namely whether the perception is to be identified\nas a manifestation of self-evident principles of common sense, or as a\npsychological association of ideas. In this sense Hamilton's thesis is\nstill set within the fundamental parameters of the Hume/Reid debate.\n \nAt the time of his death, Hamilton's philosophical endeavors were\nwidely regarded as offering the most profound treatment to date of\nsome of philosophy's deepest and most perennial problems. This\nestimation did not persist for long. Two devastating attacks, from\nstrikingly different philosophical perspectives, appeared in print\nwithin a decade. The best known of these was John Stuart Mill's\nExamination of Sir William Hamilton's Philosophy (1865).\nMill's two volume work constituted a detailed and highly critical\nexamination of Hamilton's philosophical contentions (as well as his\nexcursions into logic) largely from the point of view of empiricism in\ngeneral, and empirical psychology in particular. In the same year, the\nScottish philosopher Hutchison Stirling, in Sir William Hamilton:\nBeing the Philosophy of Perception an Analysis published the\nfirst (and ultimately only) part of an equally strenuous attack from\nan Idealist point of view. Hamilton's defenders leapt into print,\nnotably the Oxford philosopher H L Mansel (whom Mill had also\nattacked) and John Veitch, Hamilton's student and amanuensis. James\nMcCosh, then Professor of Logic at Belfast, also joined the fray with\nAn Examination of Mr J S Mill's Philosophy (1866), though\nthis was much more an attack on Mill than a defence of Hamilton. \nDespite these vigorous voices, Hamilton's philosophical reputation\ndeclined rapidly. In terms of the tradition of Scottish philosophy,\nhowever, it was not Mill who mattered most, but Hamilton's student and\nfriend James Frederick Ferrier. It was Ferrier who strove most\nobviously, in the name of Scottish philosophy, to take a different\ntack from both Reid and Hamilton. \nThough the expression “Scottish philosophy” came to be\never more widely used in the second half of the 19th century, its\nfirst appearance was in the title of a privately printed pamphlet by\nJ.F. Ferrier—Scottish Philosophy, the Old and the New\n(1854). Ferrier chose this title because his pamphlet was expressly\nwritten in defence of the contention that it is possible to engage in\nsomething called “Scottish philosophy” while departing\nradically from the tenets of Reid, Stewart and so on. Ferrier writes\nwith great force and feeling. \nThe explanation of the feeling with which Ferrier writes lies in the\nfact his little book is a response to the charge levelled against him\nin the contest for Hamilton's Chair of Logic and Metaphysics at\nEdinburgh (then still in the gift of the Town Council), when he was\naccused by the Free Church party of departing from “the Scottish\nphilosophy” in favour of some sort of Hegelianism. This charge\nwas almost certainly motivated by the ecclesiastical rivalries\ngenerated by the Disruption in the Church of Scotland that took place\nin 1843, but it is nonetheless true that Ferrier expressly denounces a\ncertain conception of “Common Sense” philosophy, and one\nwhich he identifies closely with Reid. Indeed he is not afraid to\nrepeat his objections in his defence of himself. \nIt is important to note that Ferrier thinks this castigation of one\nversion of “Common Sense” philosophy is quite compatible\nwith claiming the right to be the inheritor of, though not restricted\nby, the programme of Reid and Hamilton. And there are indeed several\npoints of contact to be observed. The first is this. Ferrier shares\nwith Hamilton a largely unspoken assumption that the question of mind\nand world lies at the heart of philosophy. This assumption signalled a\nmove away from the much broader conception of moral philosophy as both\npsychological and social inquiry, which as we have already\nnoted, is characteristic of Ferguson, Hume, Adam Smith, and even Reid\nin part. Second, and more importantly perhaps, Ferrier's own\nphilosophical reflections continue to fit Davie's description of\nScottish philosophy as a “dialogue between the vulgar and the\nlearned”. \nFerrier's reputation rested upon an earlier series of essays on\nThe Philosophy of Consciousness which appeared in Blackwood's\nMagazine between 1838 and 1843. In these essays he took his stand on\nthe contention that consciousness implies the impossibility of a\nnaturalistic science of mind, and in a later essay robustly defends a\nversion of Berkeleyan idealism. While Reid thought that Berkeley's\nphilosophical position was one that “no man in his senses could\nbelieve”, somewhat surprisingly perhaps, Ferrier describes\nBerkeley as “the champion of common sense…who could have\nfoiled the prince of skeptics at his own weapons” (Ferrier 1865,\n301). “Among all philosophers ancient or modern, we are\nacquainted with none who presents fewer vulnerable points that Bishop\nBerkeley. His language it is true, has sometimes the appearance of\nparadox; but there is nothing paradoxical in his thoughts, and time\nhas proved the adamantine solidity of his principles.”\n(ibid. p. 291) By Ferrier's account, Berkeley settles the\nissue of sensation and perception with which Hamilton struggled, by\nseeing that there is a false abstraction here. \nOn this interpretation Berkeley espouses a sort of idealism but \nIn this way Ferrier, despite his disagreements, actually concurs with\nReid's strictures on the kind of philosophical theorizing that tries\nto deploy Newtonian methods in the way that Hume does. Indeed, Ferrier\nthinks that “the inert and lifeless character of modern\nphilosophy is ultimately attributable to her having degenerated into a\nphysical science” (ibid., 191), and he condemns the resulting\n“picture of man” as “a wretched association machine,\nthrough which ideas pass linked only by laws over which the machine\nhas no control” (ibid., 196). His alternative to this\nexternalist conception of “the science of mind” is a\nreturn to the introspective examination of human consciousness.\n“Consciousness is philosophy nascent; philosophy is\nconsciousness in full bloom and blow. The difference between them is\nonly one of degree, and not one of kind; and thus all conscious men\nare to a certain extent philosophers, although they may not know\nit” (ibid., 197) In short, the proper engagement of philosophy\nis a matter of bringing consciousness to a better understanding of\nitself, which is at least one interpretation of the ambition of Reid's\nInquiry. \nFerrier's philosophy, then, can be construed as both importantly\ndifferent to Reid's, and at the same time another exploration in the\ncommon sense tradition. For Reid, Berkeley is the principal architect\nof “the way of ideas”, and hence though not himself a\nskeptic, the purveyor of a philosophy that makes radical skepticism\ninevitable. In sharp contrast, for Ferrier, Berkeley's philosophy\n(with some additions of Ferrier's own) is the answer to\nskepticism. By rejecting the philosophers' invention of 'matter',\nBerkely means to affirm common sense. It hardly needs to be said that\nthis construction of Berkeley was a highly controversial position.\nMoreover, it throws the whole subject of mind and consciousness back\ninto the realms of metaphysical philosophy and hence seems to abandon\nthe shared methodological assumption that, to quote Reid again,\n“there is but one way to the knowledge of nature's works; the\nway of observation and experiment” a supposition he\nwholeheartedly shared with Hume. This implication—that the\nmethods of the sciences are inapplicable to philosophy—somewhat\nisolated Ferrier within Scottish philosophy. Though he was regarded\nwith great acclaim in continental Europe, Scottish philosophers moved\nin different directions, some to an intensification of the\nexperimental method, and some to Absolute Idealism. Of the first\ngroup, the most prominent and influential was Alexander Bain. \nAlexander Bain was Regius Professor of Logic at the University of\nAberdeen from 1860 to 1880. A man of remarkable gifts, he was\nappointed to the Chair largely on the strength of distinguished\nphilosophical work he had published while working as a journalist in\nLondon. It was there that he made the acquaintance of John Stuart Mill\nwith whom he formed a lasting friendship. Dissertations on Leading\nPhilosophical Questions (1903), is a collection of his essays\npublished in retirement, though almost all had originally appeared in\nthe journal Mind, a journal he was instrumental in founding,\nIn several of these essays, Bain takes Reid and Hamilton as his\nstarting point and, broadly, follows the same methods. But, his\nsympathy with Mill and anti-metaphysical inclinations led him to push\nthem in a much more strongly empirical direction. The most interesting\nof his Dissertations, in this connection, is entitled\n“Associationist Controversies” and at the heart of these\ncontroversies we can find a distinction between philosophy and\npsychology that both reveals the significant difference between Bain\nand Ferrier, and establishes the discipline of experimental psychology\nin its own right. \nBain can be interpreted as a practitioner of the “science of\nmind” no less than Reid or Hume. But whereas in Reid and Hume\n(and Ferrier) the distinction between philosophy and psychology as the\nmodern world understands it, was unclear, it is one of Bain's chief\nclaims to enduring significance that, as this quotation reveals, he\nbrought the distinction between psychological and metaphysical\nquestions to prominence, and in what would now be called his research\nprogramme he gave priority to the former. The conclusion to be drawn\nis that Bain, like Ferrier, can be seen to stand in the tradition of\nScottish philosophy in the sense that he adopted its methods. But in\ncontrast to Ferrier, he did so in ways that further removed the\nquestion of sensation and perception from the realms of traditional\nmetaphysics, and pressed the study of the mind in the direction of\nempirical psychology. \nOne notable feature of this development lies in the fact that Bain was\none of the principal exponents and defenders of\n“associationism”, whose origins, arguably, are to be found\nmost clearly in Hume's Treatise. Associationism is the\napplication of empirical observation to the relation between ideas and\nexperiences. What it seeks is observed regularities, in the hope of\nformulating psychological laws that will enable us to order the\ncontents of mind. Two such principles—Contiguity and\nSimilarity—were widely accepted, and identified by Bain as being\nemployed by Reid and Hamilton. A third—Contrast—was more\ndisputable, and in “Associationist Controversies” Bain is\nprincipally concerned with the nature and identifiable independence of\nprinciples such as these. \nHowever, in the present context his arguments are chiefly interesting\nnot so much for their elaboration of associationism, as for the light\nthey throw on the development of Scottish philosophy in the nineteenth\ncentury. One point in particular seems to me illuminating. In the\ndispute between Reid and Hume with respect to the operations of the\nmind one of the fundamental points of difference is this. Reid is\ntrying, in the main, to establish basic principles of the mind's\noperation which will vindicate its rationality, and hence avoid the\ndepths of skepticism into which Hume's account forces it. Hume, on the\ncontrary, declares that “reason is nothing but a wonderful and\nunintelligible instinct in our souls which carries us along a certain\ntrain of ideas…[and that this] habit is nothing but one of the\nprinciples of nature, and derives all its force from that\norigin” (Hume 1888, 179), Reid's purpose is precisely to show\nthat the basic operations of the mind are more than psychological\nregularities. They are exercises of intelligibility. Now in terms of\nthis difference, Bain is of Hume's persuasion. This is revealed not\nmerely in his striking deployment of decidedly Humean terminology\nwhen, for instance, he contrasts the perception and the memory of a\nthing in terms of “vividness” (Bain 1903, 42). It is even\nmore evident when he asserts that “The flow of representations\nin dreaming and madness offers the best field of observation for the\nstudy of associations as such” (ibid., 45). \nWhat this remark reveals is that Bain is interested first in\nestablishing empirical laws with respect to the contents of the human\nmind. The reason that he thinks dreaming and madness are the best\nplaces to start is precisely because he sees that the pursuit of\nrational principles, that is to say, philosophically coherent\nprinciples, is likely to distort our observation by inclining us to\nsee rational connections rather than empirical associations, or as he\nputs it “associations as such”. In this respect he is\nemploying Hume's rather than Reid's conception of human nature.\nCertainly he reserves judgement on the final outcome of these\ninvestigations with respect to philosophy, arguing only for the\npriority of psychology over metaphysics and not, as Hume may be said\nto do, for the elimination of the second by the first. But so far as\nthe science of mind that had been such a marked feature of Scottish\nphilosophy goes, Bain clearsightedly pursues its more empirical\nambitions. \nFor Ferrier the empirical laws of association that Bain seeks are not\n“truths in philosophy”. No one can be called a philosopher\nwho merely knows and says, that in dreaming or madness this mental\nrepresentation tends to be associated with that. The philosopher\naspires, rather, to make sense of experience, and the whole point\nabout the experience of the dreamer or the madman is that no sense is\nto be made of it. By contrast, the empirical psychologist, seriously\ncommitted to the experimental method, does not, in the end, render\nconsciousness intelligible; he or she simply describes how the mind\nworks. \nWith Ferrier and Bain, then, the tension within Scottish philosophy\nthat Davie has identified is resolved in radically different ways, the\nfirst by a return to metaphysics, the second by an advance to\npsychology. Both can claim to be inheritors of the Scottish tradition,\nand yet both, in quite different ways, may be said to have implied its\ndemise. With Bain, the nature of the demise is evident; the philosophy\nof mind is replaced by empirical psychology. With Ferrier, the nature\nof the demise is rather different. Faced with the prospect of\nreturning to Berkeleyan metaphysics, several prominent Scottish\nphilosophers preferred to look elsewhere, namely to Germany and Hegel.\nThe result was that as the century ended a group of philosophers based\nchiefly in the Universities of Glasgow and St Andrews and known as the\nScottish Idealists came to prominence. \nIn his illuminating study Scottish Philosophy, importantly\nsubtitled A comparison of the Scottish and German answers to\nHume, and the first of two sets of Balfour Lectures, Andrew Seth\nremarks: \nSeth does not say who it is he has in mind, but a knowledge of the\nperiod makes it relatively easy to surmise. In fact Seth himself (he\nchanged his name to Seth Pringle-Pattison in 1898) was for a time\nidentified as one in virtue of being joint editor with R B Haldane of\nEssays in Philosophical Criticism (1883). This volume came to\nbe regarded as the Scottish Idealists' philosophical manifesto, though\nSeth in his second set of Balfour Lectures Hegelianism and\nPersonality registered a fundamental disagreements with the\nIdealists. The reference to “a German stamp”, however, may\nbe somewhat misleading. An interest in, and a knowledge of, Kant can\nbe found to go back to Hamilton, and far from being regarded as a\nthreat to the Scottish tradition was recognized (by Veitch, for\ninstance) as an important part of its enrichment. The German\nphilosophy referred to here, then, is that which emanated from\nHegel. \nThe Secret of Hegel is the title of a very large book by\nJames Hutchison Stirling (Hamilton's Idealist critic), first published\nin 1864. Stirling is credited with bringing Hegel to the attention of\nBritish (and not just Scottish) philosophy for the first time, though\na wit at the time remarked that if Stirling did know the secret of\nHegel, he had kept it to himself! Though Stirling was, in modern\nterms, a layman (he held no university post) the book was well\nreceived. Combined with his critical volume on Hamilton (published\njust one year later, Stirling's work key to the diminishing interest\nin the Common Sense tradition within Scottish philosophy and the\nincreasing influence of German Idealism and Hegel in particular, a\ndevelopment that may be said to have culminated in the first complete\nEnglish translation of Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit in\n1910 by J.B. Baillie, Regius Professor of Moral Philosophy at the\nUniversity of Aberdeen. \nOf the Scottish Idealists the most prominent and influential was\nEdward Caird (1835–1908). A graduate of the University of\nGlasgow, after a period at Oxford he returned in 1866 to become\nGlasgow's Professor of Moral Philosophy, a post he held for almost 30\nyears, before returning to Oxford to become Master of Balliol. Caird\nwas an admirer of Kant, but believed that Kant had failed to\ncapitalize fully on his own insights, and that the real import of his\nphilosophy could be uncovered with the help of Hegel. The aim of\nphilosophy, on this interpretation, was the ultimate reconciliation of\nseemingly incompatible elements in human experience—religion and\nscience, freedom and causality, reason and desire, for instance, but\nabove all and at its most abstract, subject and object (or mind and\nbody). The employment of these distinctions is essential to making\nhuman experience intelligible, but once they are held to be absolute\nerror and confusion arises. Materialism makes the distinction between\nmind and body absolute and seeks to explain the former in terms of the\nlatter; Cartesianism works in reverse. Both result in rendering the\nrelation mysterious. \nThe solution lies in the Hegelian perception that our knowledge is\nperfected when its objects are conceived as parts of a whole,\nultimately the Absolute. This way of understanding, however, is not\nsomething to be accomplished simply. Human understanding evolves as\nhuman experience increases and our knowledge expands. Accordingly,\nCaird and the other Scottish Idealists, especially David Ritchie at St\nAndrews, welcomed the growth of natural science, and especially\nbiology, as providing important new material for the further\nevolutionary development of human understanding as a whole. \nThree consequent problems can be said to have occupied them chiefly.\nThe first was to avoid the charge of “mentalism” or\n“panpsychism”. The Idealist contention that materialism is\nfalse leads easily to the counter accusation that the world is made of\nmental stuff. This charge is often leveled at Berkeley, interest in\nwhom greatly increased among Scottish philosophers at this time.\nAlexander Campbell Fraser, Professor of Logic and Metaphysics at the\nUniversity of Edinburgh, though not himself an Idealist in\nphilosophy,became editor of a new collected edition of Berkeley's\nworks. Ferrier, Fraser and Seth all denied that Berkeley's\nimmaterialism amounts to mentalism, but it became common to\ndistinguish between “subjective Idealism” and\n“Absolute Idealism”, the latter being the doctrine the\nScottish Idealists espoused. \nAppeal to “The Absolute”, however, brings another\ndanger—a threat to the reality of individual finite minds. There\nis a risk that the individual subject is reduced to a modification of\nthe one Absolute universal mind, and hence eliminated as an\nindependently existing centre of consciousness. This was the principal\nreason that led Seth to conclude against Hegelianism in his second set\nof Balfour Lectures, and he identified it as a problem that the other\nIdealists (notably Caird) failed to avoid. \nThe third issue is religion. How does “the Absolute”\nrelate to “God”? This was not simply a question internal\nto Idealist philosophy, but of far wider cultural and intellectual\nconcern, partly because of the threat that Darwinian biology and\nBiblical “higher” criticism seemed to pose for Christian\ntheism, and partly because of the rise of anthropological inquiry and\nthe new “science of religions”. Edward Caird's brother\nJohn, a prominent churchman, Professor of Divinity at Glasgow,\nsubsequently Principal of the University, and also an Idealist in\nphilosophy, devoted this Croall Lectures to this topic. A more\nsustained opportunity to address these questions arose with the\nestablishment in 1882 of the Gifford Lectures at the four Scottish\nUniversities. Several series of these important lectures were given by\nthe principal Scottish Idealists, and subsequently\npublished—The Evolution of Religion (1891–2) by\nEdward Caird (widely regarded as his philosophical masterpiece),\nNaturalism and Agnosticism (1896–8) by J.S. Ward, and\nThe Fundamental Ideas of Christianity (1912–13) by John\nCaird, are three of the most important. All of them deploy the\nresources of Idealist philosophy to defend a version of theism that is\ncompatible with evolutionary biology. They do so in part by\ninterpreting the concept of “evolution” philosophically so\nthat both thought and religion are understood to evolve, no less than\nbiological organism. \nDid Scottish Idealism constitute a revitalization and continuation of\nthe Scottish philosophical tradition, or its demise? James McCosh who\npublished The Scottish Philosophy, Biographical, Expository,\nCritical, from Hutcheson to Hamilton, in 1874 had no doubt.\nWriting from the distant perspective of Princeton he held that the\nScottish philosophy was now opposed within Scotland on two\nfronts—by the materialism of Bain on the one hand, and on the\nother, by the Hegelianism of Caird (described by George Davie as\n“a very untypical Scotsman and one quite exceptionally apathetic\nto educational customs of the country” (Davie 1961 86)). \nMcCosh was in a good position to make this assessment. As a student at\nthe University of Glasgow he acquired a wide knowledge of the\ntradition (though this seems to have been due more to the library than\nthe lecture hall), and later while a divinity student at Edinburgh he\nattended Hamilton's lectures. Ordained to the ministry of the Church\nof Scotland in 1834, McCosh got caught up in the conflicts that\neventually led to the great Disruption of 1843, and split the national\nchurch for almost 100 years. Though he ministered faithfully for the\nFree church side, he also found time to continue with his\nphilosophical studies and in 1850 published The Method of the\nDivine Government, Physical and Moral, a work that eventually ran\nto thirteen editions. On the strength of this book, McCosh was offered\nthe Professorship of Logic and Metaphysics at the Queen's College\nBelfast, part of the newly created National University of Ireland.\nEighteen years later he accepted the Presidency of the College of New\nJersey (subsequently Princeton University) where he also taught moral\nphilosophy, even after his retirement from the Presidency in 1888. \nFor McCosh, the heart of ‘the Scottish philosophy’ lay in\nits combination of observational methods of inquiry with moral and\nreligious formation. “Ever since I became a teacher of the\nscience of mind” he writes, “I have given more attention\nto philosophy than theology. In doing this I have been able to serve\nreligion more effectively than any other course I could have\ntaken” (McCosh 1896, 251). Given this account of what made the\nScottish philosophy distinctive, it is easy to see why McCosh thought\nthe philosophical schools becoming fashionable in Scotland signalled\nits demise. The materialism of Bain fastened on the former\n(observational methods) but abandoned the latter (moral formation),\nwhile the Idealism of Caird abandoned the former in the interests of\nthe latter. \nMcCosh's pessimism that the combination of Realism and Theism which\nunderlay the Scottish philosophical enterprise from Hutcheson to\nHamilton had foundered within the universities of Scotland, was offset\nby his hope and belief that the rising cultural and intellectual\nindependence of the United States from its European origins would\nconstitute fertile ground for a new ‘American’ philosophy\nthat would both continue and develop all that was best in the Scottish\ntradition. He proved to be quite wrong in this speculation. Two\nphilosophies rose to prominence in America. Both of them had some\nconnection with what came to be known a little later as the\n“college philosophy” that emanated from Scotland via\nPrinceton. One was a version of Idealism that was sympathetic to\ntheism, and the other Pragmatism, which owed something to Reidian\n‘Common Sense’. Neither of them, however, was Realist, and\nboth were soon displaced by logical positivism. \nWhile McCosh regarded the division between empiricists like Bain, and\nIdealists such as Caird, to be largely exhaustive, he did leave open\nthe possibility of persisting with the insights and methods of\nScottish philosophy, and commended a few individuals in this respect,\namong them Robert Flint (1838–1910), who was Professor of Moral\nPhilosophy at St Andrews before moving to the Chair of Divinity at\nEdinburgh. McCosh's list is short, and does not include Andrew Seth.\nYet arguably it was Seth who, in a major work published some decades\nlater, proved to be the most articulate exponent of the Scottish\nphilosophical tradition, retaining the fundamentals of Scottish\nphilosophy in a highly sophisticated form. \nThough McCosh does not mention Seth, it is hard to believe that he did\nnot know of Seth's earlier lectures on Scottish philosophy since these\nappeared in print before McCosh had retired from the Presidency at\nPrinceton. In any event, there is an interesting historical connection\nbetween the two men. As President of the College of New Jersey,\nMcCosh's vision and energy laid the foundations for its transformation\nfrom a worthy regional institution to an internationally acknowledged\nleader in higher education. It was in 1896, two years after McCosh's\ndeath, that this remarkable transformation was finally acknowledged in\nthe change of name to Princeton University. Seth (by then Seth\nPringle-Pattison) was invited to attend the celebrations on behalf of\nthe University of Edinburgh, and gave two lectures on Theism. \nIt was twenty years later, however, before his magnum opus,\nThe Idea of God in the Light of Recent Philosophy appeared.\nThis book began life as Gifford Lectures delivered at the University\nof Aberdeen in the years 1912 and 1913. World War I (in which Seth's\nson Ronald fought and died) delayed both their revision and their\npublication. Consequently, they were not published until 1917. Lecture\nOne begins with David Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural\nReligion, and taking that as his starting point, Seth proceeds to\naddress all the issues that had long dominated philosophical debate in\nScotland. These include the existence of God, the relation of mind to\nbody, the nature and scope of science, the theory of knowledge and the\nproblem of skepticism. The 'recent philosophy', to which the subtitle\nrefers, is the division and debate between empirical psychology and\nidealistic philosophy that had taken up competing sides on these\nquestions. The heart of Seth's strategy is to analyze the defects of\nof empiricism and Idealism, and then to seek an integration of the\ncompelling philosophical insights of both. He acknowledges that the\nScottish philosophical tradition is inherently naturalistic, while at\nthe same time accepting the Idealists rejection of Hume's narrow\nempiricism. In Lecture V of the first series, Seth accordingly\nelaborates and defends what he calls 'higher' naturalism. Three\nelements are key to this more sophisticated version of the naturalism\nthat united Hume and Reid. First, philosophy has to be grounded in\nexperience. It relies on both introspection and experiment, and cannot\nproceed satisfactorily in the form of rationalistic deductions from a\npriori principles. Second, dispassionately considered, we experience\ndifferent orders of mind. The mind of animals is different to the mind\nof human beings. In particular, the human mind exhibits moral\nconsciousness, something wholly lacking in other creatures. This is no\nless a fact of experience than anything biological observation or\nlaboratory experiments might reveal. Given these critical differences\nbetween the kinds of mind experienced in nature, it is a mistake to\nseek to bring all evolved creatures within the scope of a unitary\ncausal or biological explanation. Thirdly, the perennial task of\nphilosophy is to search for a comprehensive explanation of experience.\nPhilosophy's proper ambition is not to be a distinctive science, but\nto formulate an explanatory understanding that will integrate the\nradical differences within experience without eliminating them. Both\npsychologism and Idealism, whatever other merits they may have, fail\nin this respect. \nSeth's scope of reference, the subtlety of his arguments, his\nfamiliarity with the most recent advances in evolutionary biology and\nexperimental psychology make The Idea of God a remarkable\nwork. It represents a synthesis of profound learning that extended\nover almost half a century, from his days as a student until close to\nhis retirement as a Professor. In his retirement Seth published two\nmore substantial books, one of them a second set of Gifford Lectures,\nyet there is no doubt that The Idea of God is his finest\nwork, and a major philosophical accomplishment by any standard. Issued\nby Britain's most prestigious academic publisher, the Clarendon Press\nat Oxford University, the book was widely reviewed and highly\nacclaimed at the time of its publication. Yet it did not long retain\nthe attention it received at first, and subsequently sank into\nobscurity. In the last hundred years it has almost never been referred\nto. Given its merits, why should this be? \nMcCosh was correct in claiming that neither the empirical psychology\nof Bain, nor the Hegelian Idealism of Caird, was an adequate successor\nto the philosophical tradition to which, for the most part, they owed\ntheir origins. Nevertheless, both succeeded in attracting the talent\nand enthusiasm of a new generation of scholars, and they did so to\npowerful effect. Psychology became a hugely influential voice in the\nworld of intellectual inquiry, and alongside other social 'sciences'\nsuch as sociology, economics and political science, this seemed to\nvalidate a strictly empirical approach to the study of many of the\ntopics that had occupied the philosophers of the Scottish\nEnlightenment. As a result, all these new subjects, whose origins owed\nmuch to Scottish philosophy, grew in allegiance and prestige.\nInevitably, this development had a philosophical effect. The new\n'sciences' gave greater credibility to the empiricist epistemology\nthat appeared to underwrite them. Meanwhile, in a similar spirit,\nIdealist philosophy came under attack. In 1903, the Cambridge\nphilosopher G.E. Moore published an essay entitled “The\nRefutation of Idealism”. It is arguable that Moore did not\nunderstand what he was aiming to refute, but in any event his essay\nbegan a return to ascendancy by the British empiricist tradition,\naided in part by the Logical Empiricism that emanated from Austria and\nthen took root in America. In due course this spelt the end of British\nIdealism. For empiricists, the most significant Scottish philosopher\nwas now identified as Hume, whose naturalism, ironically, had been\nimportantly rehabilitated by Norman Kemp Smith, Seth's student and\nsuccessor. By this time Reid's star had long been waning, and he\nquickly came to be forgotten. For more than fifty years, both Reid\nand Hegel disappeared from the curriculum and\nconscientiousness of philosophers in Scotland. Accordingly, two major\ncontributors to the 'recent philosophy' that Seth took to be the\nrelevant context of his Gifford Lectures, were silenced. Little\nwonder, then, that his brilliant rapprochement between these\nperpetually antagonistic currents in philosophical thought soon\ndisappeared.","contact.mail":"gordon.graham@ptsem.edu","contact.domain":"ptsem.edu"}]
