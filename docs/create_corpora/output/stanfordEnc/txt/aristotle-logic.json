It\ndid not always hold this position: in the Hellenistic period, Stoic\nlogic, and in particular the work of Chrysippus, took pride of place.\nHowever, in later antiquity, following the work of Aristotelian\nCommentators, Aristotle’s logic became dominant, and\nAristotelian logic was what was transmitted to the Arabic and the\nLatin medieval traditions, while the works of Chrysippus have not\nsurvived. \n\n\nThis unique historical position has not always contributed to the\nunderstanding of Aristotle’s logical works. Kant thought that\nAristotle had discovered everything there was to know about logic, and\nthe historian of logic Prantl drew the corollary that any logician\nafter Aristotle who said anything new was confused, stupid, or\nperverse. During the rise of modern formal logic following Frege and\nPeirce, adherents of Traditional Logic (seen as the descendant of\nAristotelian Logic) and the new mathematical logic tended to see one\nanother as rivals, with incompatible notions of logic. More recent\nscholarship has often applied the very techniques of mathematical\nlogic to Aristotle’s theories, revealing (in the opinion of\nmany) a number of similarities of approach and interest between\nAristotle and modern logicians.\n\n\nThis article is written from the latter perspective. As such, it is\nabout Aristotle’s logic, which is not always the same thing as\nwhat has been called “Aristotelian” logic.\n\nAristotle’s logical works contain the earliest formal study of\nlogic that we have. It is therefore all the more remarkable that\ntogether they comprise a highly developed logical theory, one that was\nable to command immense respect for many centuries: Kant, who was ten\ntimes more distant from Aristotle than we are from him, even held that\nnothing significant had been added to Aristotle’s views in the\nintervening two millennia.  \nIn the last century, Aristotle’s reputation as a logician has\nundergone two remarkable reversals. The rise of modern formal logic\nfollowing the work of Frege and Russell brought with it a recognition\nof the many serious limitations of Aristotle’s logic; today,\nvery few would try to maintain that it is adequate as a basis for\nunderstanding science, mathematics, or even everyday reasoning. At the\nsame time, scholars trained in modern formal techniques have come to\nview Aristotle with new respect, not so much for the correctness of\nhis results as for the remarkable similarity in spirit between much of\nhis work and modern logic. As Jonathan Lear has put it,\n“Aristotle shares with modern logicians a fundamental interest\nin metatheory”: his primary goal is not to offer a practical\nguide to argumentation but to study the properties of inferential\nsystems themselves. \nThe ancient commentators grouped together several of Aristotle’s\ntreatises under the title Organon (“Instrument”)\nand regarded them as comprising his logical works:  \nIn fact, the title Organon reflects a much later controversy\nabout whether logic is a part of philosophy (as the Stoics maintained)\nor merely a tool used by philosophy (as the later Peripatetics\nthought); calling the logical works “The Instrument” is a\nway of taking sides on this point. Aristotle himself never uses this\nterm, nor does he give much indication that these particular treatises\nform some kind of group, though there are frequent cross-references\nbetween the Topics and the Analytics. On the other\nhand, Aristotle treats the Prior and Posterior\nAnalytics as one work, and On Sophistical Refutations is\na final section, or an appendix, to the Topics). To these\nworks should be added the Rhetoric, which explicitly declares\nits reliance on the Topics.  \nAll Aristotle’s logic revolves around one notion: the\ndeduction (sullogismos). A thorough\nexplanation of what a deduction is, and what they are composed of,\nwill necessarily lead us through the whole of his theory. What, then,\nis a deduction? Aristotle says:  \nEach of the “things supposed” is a\npremise (protasis) of the argument, and what\n“results of necessity” is the conclusion\n(sumperasma).  \nThe core of this definition is the notion of “resulting of\nnecessity” (ex anankês sumbainein). This\ncorresponds to a modern notion of logical consequence: \\(X\\) results\nof necessity from \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\) if it would be impossible for \\(X\\)\nto be false when \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\) are true. We could therefore take\nthis to be a general definition of “valid argument”. \nDeductions are one of two species of argument recognized by Aristotle.\nThe other species is induction\n(epagôgê). He has far less to say about this than\ndeduction, doing little more than characterize it as “argument\nfrom the particular to the universal”. However, induction (or\nsomething very much like it) plays a crucial role in the theory of\nscientific knowledge in the Posterior Analytics: it is\ninduction, or at any rate a cognitive process that moves from\nparticulars to their generalizations, that is the basis of knowledge\nof the indemonstrable first principles of sciences.  \nDespite its wide generality, Aristotle’s definition of deduction\nis not a precise match for a modern definition of validity. Some of\nthe differences may have important consequences:  \nOf these three possible restrictions, the most interesting would be\nthe third. This could be (and has been) interpreted as committing\nAristotle to something like a\n relevance logic.\n In fact, there are passages that appear to confirm this. However,\nthis is too complex a matter to discuss here.  \nHowever the definition is interpreted, it is clear that Aristotle does\nnot mean to restrict it only to a subset of the valid arguments. This\nis why I have translated sullogismos with\n‘deduction’ rather than its English cognate. In modern\nusage, ‘syllogism’ means an argument of a very specific\nform. Moreover, modern usage distinguishes between valid syllogisms\n(the conclusions of which follow from their premises) and invalid\nsyllogisms (the conclusions of which do not follow from their\npremises). The second of these is inconsistent with Aristotle’s\nuse: since he defines a sullogismos as an argument in which\nthe conclusion results of necessity from the premises, “invalid\nsullogismos” is a contradiction in terms. The first is\nalso at least highly misleading, since Aristotle does not appear to\nthink that the sullogismoi are simply an interesting subset\nof the valid arguments. Moreover (see below), Aristotle expends great\nefforts to argue that every valid argument, in a broad sense, can be\n“reduced” to an argument, or series of arguments, in\nsomething like one of the forms traditionally called a syllogism. If\nwe translate sullogismos as “syllogism, ”, this\nbecomes the trivial claim “Every syllogism is a\nsyllogism”, \nSyllogisms are structures of sentences each of which can meaningfully\nbe called true or false: assertions\n(apophanseis), in Aristotle’s terminology. According to\nAristotle, every such sentence must have the same structure: it must\ncontain a subject (hupokeimenon) and a\npredicate and must either affirm or deny the\npredicate of the subject. Thus, every assertion is either the\naffirmation kataphasis or the\ndenial (apophasis) of a single predicate of\na single subject.  \nIn On Interpretation, Aristotle argues that a single\nassertion must always either affirm or deny a single predicate of a\nsingle subject. Thus, he does not recognize sentential compounds, such\nas conjunctions and disjunctions, as single assertions. This appears\nto be a deliberate choice on his part: he argues, for instance, that a\nconjunction is simply a collection of assertions, with no more\nintrinsic unity than the sequence of sentences in a lengthy account\n(e.g. the entire Iliad, to take Aristotle’s own\nexample). Since he also treats denials as one of the two basic species\nof assertion, he does not view negations as sentential compounds. His\ntreatment of conditional sentences and disjunctions is more difficult\nto appraise, but it is at any rate clear that Aristotle made no\nefforts to develop a sentential logic. Some of the consequences of\nthis for his theory of demonstration are important. \nSubjects and predicates of assertions are terms. A\nterm (horos) can be either individual, e.g.\nSocrates, Plato or universal, e.g. human,\nhorse, animal, white. Subjects may be\neither individual or universal, but predicates can only be universals:\nSocrates is human, Plato is not a horse, horses\nare animals, humans are not horses.  \nThe word universal (katholou) appears to be\nan Aristotelian coinage. Literally, it means “of a whole”;\nits opposite is therefore “of a particular”\n(kath’ hekaston). Universal terms are those which can\nproperly serve as predicates, while particular terms are those which\ncannot. \nThis distinction is not simply a matter of grammatical function. We\ncan readily enough construct a sentence with “Socrates” as\nits grammatical predicate: “The person sitting down is\nSocrates”. Aristotle, however, does not consider this a genuine\npredication. He calls it instead a merely accidental\nor incidental (kata sumbebêkos)\npredication. Such sentences are, for him, dependent for their truth\nvalues on other genuine predications (in this case, “Socrates is\nsitting down”). \nConsequently, predication for Aristotle is as much a matter of\nmetaphysics as a matter of grammar. The reason that the term\nSocrates is an individual term and not a universal is that\nthe entity which it designates is an individual, not a universal. What\nmakes white and human universal terms is that they\ndesignate universals. \nFurther discussion of these issues can be found in the entry on\n Aristotle’s metaphysics. \nAristotle takes some pains in On Interpretation to argue that\nto every affirmation there corresponds exactly one denial such that\nthat denial denies exactly what that affirmation affirms. The pair\nconsisting of an affirmation and its corresponding denial is a\ncontradiction (antiphasis). In general,\nAristotle holds, exactly one member of any contradiction is true and\none false: they cannot both be true, and they cannot both be false.\nHowever, he appears to make an exception for propositions about future\nevents, though interpreters have debated extensively what this\nexception might be (see\n further discussion\n below). The principle that contradictories cannot both be true has\nfundamental importance in Aristotle’s metaphysics (see\n further discussion\n below).  \nOne major difference between Aristotle’s understanding of\npredication and modern (i.e., post-Fregean) logic is that Aristotle\ntreats individual predications and general predications as similar in\nlogical form: he gives the same analysis to “Socrates is an\nanimal” and “Humans are animals”. However, he notes\nthat when the subject is a universal, predication takes on two forms:\nit can be either universal or\nparticular. These expressions are parallel to those\nwith which Aristotle distinguishes universal and particular terms, and\nAristotle is aware of that, explicitly distinguishing between a term\nbeing a universal and a term being universally predicated of another.\n \nWhatever is affirmed or denied of a universal subject may be affirmed\nor denied of it it universally (katholou or\n“of all”, kata pantos), in part\n(kata meros, en merei), or\nindefinitely (adihoristos). \nIn On Interpretation, Aristotle spells out the relationships\nof contradiction for sentences with universal subjects as follows:\n \nSimple as it appears, this table raises important difficulties of\ninterpretation (for a thorough discussion, see the entry on the\n square of opposition). \nIn the Prior Analytics, Aristotle adopts a somewhat\nartificial way of expressing predications: instead of saying\n“\\(X\\) is predicated of \\(Y\\)” he says “\\(X\\)\nbelongs (huparchei) to \\(Y\\)”. This should really be\nregarded as a technical expression. The verb huparchein\nusually means either “begin” or “exist, be\npresent”, and Aristotle’s usage appears to be a\ndevelopment of this latter use. \nFor clarity and brevity, I will use the following semi-traditional\nabbreviations for Aristotelian categorical sentences (note that the\npredicate term comes first and the subject term\nsecond):  \nAristotle’s most famous achievement as logician is his theory of\ninference, traditionally called the syllogistic\n(though not by Aristotle). That theory is in fact the theory of\ninferences of a very specific sort: inferences with two premises, each\nof which is a categorical sentence, having exactly one term in common,\nand having as conclusion a categorical sentence the terms of which are\njust those two terms not shared by the premises. Aristotle calls the\nterm shared by the premises the middle term\n(meson) and each of the other two terms in the premises an\nextreme (akron). The middle term must be\neither subject or predicate of each premise, and this can occur in\nthree ways: the middle term can be the subject of one premise and the\npredicate of the other, the predicate of both premises, or the subject\nof both premises. Aristotle refers to these term arrangements as\nfigures (schêmata):  \nAristotle calls the term which is the predicate of the conclusion the\nmajor term and the term which is the subject of the\nconclusion the minor term. The premise containing the\nmajor term is the major premise, and the premise\ncontaining the minor term is the minor premise.  \nAristotle then systematically investigates all possible combinations\nof two premises in each of the three figures. For each combination, he\neither demonstrates that some conclusion necessarily follows or\ndemonstrates that no conclusion follows. The results he states are\ncorrect. \nAristotle’s proofs can be divided into two categories, based on\na distinction he makes between “perfect” or\n“complete” (teleios) deductions and\n“imperfect” or “incomplete”\n(atelês) deductions. A deduction is perfect if it\n“needs no external term in order to show the necessary\nresult” (24b23–24), and it is imperfect if it “needs\none or several in addition that are necessary because of the terms\nsupposed but were not assumed through premises”\n(24b24–25). The precise interpretation of this distinction is\ndebatable, but it is at any rate clear that Aristotle regards the\nperfect deductions as not in need of proof in some sense. For\nimperfect deductions, Aristotle does give proofs, which invariably\ndepend on the perfect deductions. Thus, with some reservations, we\nmight compare the perfect deductions to the axioms or primitive rules\nof a deductive system.  \nIn the proofs for imperfect deductions, Aristotle says that he\n“reduces” (anagein) each case to one of the\nperfect forms and that they are thereby “completed” or\n“perfected”. These completions are either\nprobative (deiktikos: a modern translation\nmight be “direct”) or through the\nimpossible (dia to adunaton).  \nA direct deduction is a series of steps leading from the premises to\nthe conclusion, each of which is either a conversion\nof a previous step or an inference from two previous steps relying on\na first-figure deduction. Conversion, in turn, is inferring from a\nproposition another which has the subject and predicate interchanged.\nSpecifically, Aristotle argues that three such conversions are\nsound: \nHe undertakes to justify these in An. Pr. I.2. From a modern\nstandpoint, the third is sometimes regarded with suspicion. Using it\nwe can get Some monsters are chimeras from the apparently\ntrue All chimeras are monsters; but the former is often\nconstrued as implying in turn There is something which is a\nmonster and a chimera, and thus that there are monsters and there\nare chimeras. In fact, this simply points up something about\nAristotle’s system: Aristotle in effect supposes that\nall terms in syllogisms are non-empty. (For further\ndiscussion of this point, see the entry on the\n square of opposition). \nAs an example of the procedure, we may take Aristotle’s proof of\nCamestres. He says: \nFrom this text, we can extract an exact formal proof, as follows:  \nA completion or proof “through the impossible” shows that\na certain conclusion follows from a pair of premises by assuming as a\nthird premise the denial of that conclusion and giving a deduction,\nfrom it and one of the original premises, the denial (or the contrary)\nof the other premises. This is the deduction of an\n“impossible”, and Aristotle’s proof ends at that\npoint. An example is his proof of Baroco in\n27a36–b1: \nAristotle proves invalidity by constructing counterexamples. This is\nvery much in the spirit of modern logical theory: all that it takes to\nshow that a certain form is invalid is a single\ninstance of that form with true premises and a false\nconclusion. However, Aristotle states his results not by saying that\ncertain premise-conclusion combinations are invalid but by saying that\ncertain premise pairs do not “syllogize”: that is, that,\ngiven the pair in question, examples can be constructed in which\npremises of that form are true and a conclusion of any of the four\npossible forms is false.  \nWhen possible, he does this by a clever and economical method: he\ngives two triplets of terms, one of which makes the premises true and\na universal affirmative “conclusion” true, and the other\nof which makes the premises true and a universal negative\n“conclusion” true. The first is a counterexample for an\nargument with either an \\(E\\) or an \\(O\\) conclusion, and the second\nis a counterexample for an argument with either an \\(A\\) or an \\(I\\)\nconclusion. \nIn Prior Analytics I.4–6, Aristotle shows that the\npremise combinations given in the following table yield deductions and\nthat all other premise combinations fail to yield a deduction. In the\nterminology traditional since the middle ages, each of these\ncombinations is known as a mood Latin modus,\n“way”, which in turn is a translation of Greek\ntropos). Aristotle, however, does not use this expression and\ninstead refers to “the arguments in the figures”.  \nIn this table, “\\(\\vdash\\)” separates premises from\nconclusion; it may be read “therefore”. The second column\nlists the medieval mnemonic name associated with the inference (these\nare still widely used, and each is actually a mnemonic for\nAristotle’s proof of the mood in question). The third column\nbriefly summarizes Aristotle’s procedure for demonstrating the\ndeduction. \nTable of the Deductions in the Figures \nHaving established which deductions in the figures are possible,\nAristotle draws a number of metatheoretical conclusions, including:\n \nHe also proves the following metatheorem:  \nHis proof of this is elegant. First, he shows that the two particular\ndeductions of the first figure can be reduced, by proof through\nimpossibility, to the universal deductions in the second figure:  \nHe then observes that since he has already shown how to reduce all the\nparticular deductions in the other figures except Baroco and\nBocardo to Darii and Ferio, these\ndeductions can thus be reduced to Barbara and\nCelarent. This proof is strikingly similar both in structure\nand in subject to modern proofs of the redundancy of axioms in a\nsystem.  \nMany more metatheoretical results, some of them quite sophisticated,\nare proved in Prior Analytics I.45 and in Prior\nAnalytics II. As noted below, some of Aristotle’s\nmetatheoretical results are appealed to in the epistemological\narguments of the Posterior Analytics. \nAristotle follows his treatment of “arguments in the\nfigures” with a much longer, and much more problematic,\ndiscussion of what happens to these figured arguments when we add the\nqualifications “necessarily” and “possibly” to\ntheir premises in various ways. In contrast to the syllogistic itself\n(or, as commentators like to call it, the assertoric\nsyllogistic), this modal syllogistic appears to be much less\nsatisfactory and is certainly far more difficult to interpret. Here, I\nonly outline Aristotle’s treatment of this subject and note some\nof the principal points of interpretive controversy.  \nModern modal logic treats necessity and possibility as interdefinable:\n“necessarily P” is equivalent to “not possibly not\nP”, and “possibly P” to “not necessarily not\nP”. Aristotle gives these same equivalences in On\nInterpretation. However, in Prior Analytics, he makes a\ndistinction between two notions of possibility. On the first, which he\ntakes as his preferred notion, “possibly P” is equivalent\nto “not necessarily P and not necessarily not P”. He then\nacknowledges an alternative definition of possibility according to the\nmodern equivalence, but this plays only a secondary role in his\nsystem.  \nAristotle builds his treatment of modal syllogisms on his account of\nnon-modal (assertoric) syllogisms: he works his way\nthrough the syllogisms he has already proved and considers the\nconsequences of adding a modal qualification to one or both premises.\nMost often, then, the questions he explores have the form: “Here\nis an assertoric syllogism; if I add these modal qualifications to the\npremises, then what modally qualified form of the conclusion (if any)\nfollows?”. A premise can have one of three modalities: it can be\nnecessary, possible, or assertoric. Aristotle works through the\ncombinations of these in order:  \nThough he generally considers only premise combinations which\nsyllogize in their assertoric forms, he does sometimes extend this;\nsimilarly, he sometimes considers conclusions in addition to those\nwhich would follow from purely assertoric premises.  \nSince this is his procedure, it is convenient to describe modal\nsyllogisms in terms of the corresponding non-modal syllogism plus a\ntriplet of letters indicating the modalities of premises and\nconclusion: \\(N\\) = “necessary”, \\(P\\) =\n“possible”, \\(A\\) = “assertoric”. Thus,\n“Barbara \\(NAN\\)” would mean “The form\nBarbara with necessary major premise, assertoric minor\npremise, and necessary conclusion”. I use the letters\n“\\(N\\)” and “\\(P\\)” as prefixes for premises\nas well; a premise with no prefix is assertoric. Thus,\nBarbara \\(NAN\\) would be \\(NAab, Abc \\vdash NAac\\). \nAs in the case of assertoric syllogisms, Aristotle makes use of\nconversion rules to prove validity. The conversion rules for necessary\npremises are exactly analogous to those for assertoric premises:  \nPossible premises behave differently, however. Since he defines\n“possible” as “neither necessary nor\nimpossible”, it turns out that \\(x\\) is possibly \\(F\\)\nentails, and is entailed by, \\(x\\) is possibly not \\(F\\).\nAristotle generalizes this to the case of categorical sentences as\nfollows:  \nIn addition, Aristotle uses the intermodal principle \\(N\\rightarrow\nA\\): that is, a necessary premise entails the corresponding assertoric\none. However, because of his definition of possibility, the principle\n\\(A\\rightarrow P\\) does not generally hold: if it did, then\n\\(N\\rightarrow P\\) would hold, but on his definition\n“necessarily \\(P\\)” and “possibly \\(P\\)” are\nactually inconsistent (“possibly \\(P\\)” entails\n“possibly not \\(P\\)”).  \nThis leads to a further complication. The denial of “possibly\n\\(P\\)” for Aristotle is “either necessarily \\(P\\) or\nnecessarily not \\(P\\)”. The denial of “necessarily\n\\(P\\)” is still more difficult to express in terms of a\ncombination of modalities: “either possibly \\(P\\) (and thus\npossibly not \\(P\\)) or necessarily not \\(P\\)” This is important\nbecause of Aristotle’s proof procedures, which include proof\nthrough impossibility. If we give a proof through impossibility in\nwhich we assume a necessary premise, then the conclusion we ultimately\nestablish is simply the denial of that necessary premise, not a\n“possible” conclusion in Aristotle’s sense. Such\npropositions do occur in his system, but only in exactly this way,\ni.e., as conclusions established by proof through impossiblity from\nnecessary assumptions. Somewhat confusingly, Aristotle calls such\npropositions “possible” but immediately adds “ not\nin the sense defined”: in this sense, “possibly\n\\(Oab\\)” is simply the denial of “necessarily\n\\(Aab\\)”. Such propositions appear only as premises, never as\nconclusions. \nAristotle holds that an assertoric syllogism remains valid if\n“necessarily” is added to its premises and its conclusion:\nthe modal pattern \\(NNN\\) is always valid. He does not treat this as a\ntrivial consequence but instead offers proofs; in all but two cases,\nthese are parallel to those offered for the assertoric case. The\nexceptions are Baroco and Bocardo, which he proved\nin the assertoric case through impossibility: attempting to use that\nmethod here would require him to take the denial of a necessary \\(O\\)\nproposition as hypothesis, raising the complication noted above, and\nhe uses the procedure he calls ecthesis instead (see Smith\n1982). \nSince a necessary premise entails an assertoric premise, every \\(AN\\)\nor \\(NA\\) combination of premises will entail the corresponding \\(AA\\)\npair, and thus the corresponding \\(A\\) conclusion. Thus, \\(ANA\\) and\n\\(NAA\\) syllogisms are always valid. However, Aristotle holds that\nsome, but not all, \\(ANN\\) and \\(NAN\\) combinations are valid.\nSpecifically, he accepts Barbara \\(NAN\\) but rejects\nBarbara \\(ANN\\). Almost from Aristotle’s own time,\ninterpreters have found his reasons for this distinction obscure, or\nunpersuasive, or both, and often have not followed his view. His close\nassociated Theophrastus, for instance, adopted the simpler rule that\nthe modality of the conclusion of a syllogism was always the\n“weakest” modality found in either premise, where \\(N\\) is\nstronger than \\(A\\) and \\(A\\) is stronger than \\(P\\) (and where \\(P\\)\nprobably has to be defined as “not necessarily not”). \nBeginning with Albrecht Becker, interpreters using the methods of\nmodern formal logic to interpret Aristotle’s modal logic have\nseen the Two-Barbaras problem as only one of a series of difficulties\nin giving a coherent interpretation of the modal syllogistic. A very\nwide range of reconstructions has been proposed: see Becker 1933,\nMcCall 1963, Nortmann 1996, Van Rijen 1989, Patterson 1995, Thomason\n1993, Thom 1996, Rini 2012, Malink 2013. The majority of\nreconstructions do not attempt to reproduce every detail of\nAristotle’s exposition but instead produce modified\nreconstructions that abandon some of those results. Malink 2013,\nhowever, offers a reconstruction that reproduces everything Aristotle\nsays, although the resulting model introduces a high degree of\ncomplexity. (This subject quickly becomes too complex for summarizing\nin this brief article. \nA demonstration (apodeixis) is “a\ndeduction that produces knowledge”. Aristotle’s\nPosterior Analytics contains his account of demonstrations\nand their role in knowledge. From a modern perspective, we might think\nthat this subject moves outside of logic to epistemology. From\nAristotle’s perspective, however, the connection of the theory\nof sullogismoi with the theory of knowledge is especially\nclose.  \nThe subject of the Posterior Analytics is\nepistêmê. This is one of several Greek words that\ncan reasonably be translated “knowledge”, but Aristotle is\nconcerned only with knowledge of a certain type (as will be explained\nbelow). There is a long tradition of translating\nepistêmê in this technical sense as\nscience, and I shall follow that tradition here.\nHowever, readers should not be misled by the use of that word. In\nparticular, Aristotle’s theory of science cannot be considered a\ncounterpart to modern philosophy of science, at least not without\nsubstantial qualifications.  \nWe have scientific knowledge, according to Aristotle, when we\nknow: \nThis implies two strong conditions on what can be the object of\nscientific knowledge:  \nHe then proceeds to consider what science so defined will consist in,\nbeginning with the observation that at any rate one form of science\nconsists in the possession of a demonstration\n(apodeixis), which he defines as a “scientific\ndeduction”:  \nThe remainder of Posterior Analytics I is largely concerned\nwith two tasks: spelling out the nature of demonstration and\ndemonstrative science and answering an important challenge to its very\npossibility. Aristotle first tells us that a demonstration is a\ndeduction in which the premises are:  \nThe interpretation of all these conditions except the first has been\nthe subject of much controversy. Aristotle clearly thinks that science\nis knowledge of causes and that in a demonstration, knowledge of the\npremises is what brings about knowledge of the conclusion. The fourth\ncondition shows that the knower of a demonstration must be in some\nbetter epistemic condition towards them, and so modern interpreters\noften suppose that Aristotle has defined a kind of epistemic\njustification here. However, as noted above, Aristotle is defining a\nspecial variety of knowledge. Comparisons with discussions of\njustification in modern epistemology may therefore be misleading.  \nThe same can be said of the terms “primary”,\n“immediate” and “better known”. Modern\ninterpreters sometimes take “immediate” to mean\n“self-evident”; Aristotle does say that an immediate\nproposition is one “to which no other is prior”, but (as I\nsuggest in the next section) the notion of priority involved is likely\na notion of logical priority that it is hard to detach from\nAristotle’s own logical theories. “Better known” has\nsometimes been interpreted simply as “previously known to the\nknower of the demonstration” (i.e., already known in advance of\nthe demonstration). However, Aristotle explicitly distinguishes\nbetween what is “better known for us” with what is\n“better known in itself” or “in nature” and\nsays that he means the latter in his definition. In fact, he says that\nthe process of acquiring scientific knowledge is a process of\nchanging what is better known “for us”, until we\narrive at that condition in which what is better known in itself is\nalso better known for us. \nIn Posterior Analytics I.2, Aristotle considers two\nchallenges to the possibility of science. One party (dubbed the\n“agnostics” by Jonathan Barnes) began with the following\ntwo premises:  \nThey then argued that demonstration is impossible with the following\ndilemma:  \nA second group accepted the agnostics’ view that scientific\nknowledge comes only from demonstration but rejected their conclusion\nby rejecting the dilemma. Instead, they maintained:  \nAristotle does not give us much information about how circular\ndemonstration was supposed to work, but the most plausible\ninterpretation would be supposing that at least for some set of\nfundamental principles, each principle could be deduced from the\nothers. (Some modern interpreters have compared this position to a\ncoherence theory of knowledge.) However their position worked, the\ncircular demonstrators claimed to have a third alternative avoiding\nthe agnostics’ dilemma, since circular demonstration gives us a\nregress that is both unending (in the sense that we never reach\npremises at which it comes to a stop) and finite (because it works its\nway round the finite circle of premises).  \nAristotle rejects circular demonstration as an incoherent notion on\nthe grounds that the premises of any demonstration must be prior (in\nan appropriate sense) to the conclusion, whereas a circular\ndemonstration would make the same premises both prior and posterior to\none another (and indeed every premise prior and posterior to itself).\nHe agrees with the agnostics’ analysis of the regress problem:\nthe only plausible options are that it continues indefinitely or that\nit “comes to a stop” at some point. However, he thinks\nboth the agnostics and the circular demonstrators are wrong in\nmaintaining that scientific knowledge is only possible by\ndemonstration from premises scientifically known: instead, he claims,\nthere is another form of knowledge possible for the first premises,\nand this provides the starting points for demonstrations.  \nTo solve this problem, Aristotle needs to do something quite specific.\nIt will not be enough for him to establish that we can have knowledge\nof some propositions without demonstrating them: unless it is\nin turn possible to deduce all the other propositions of a science\nfrom them, we shall not have solved the regress problem. Moreover (and\nobviously), it is no solution to this problem for Aristotle simply to\nassert that we have knowledge without demonstration of some\nappropriate starting points. He does indeed say that it is his\nposition that we have such knowledge (An. Post. I.2,), but he\nowes us an account of why that should be so. \nAristotle’s account of knowledge of the indemonstrable first\npremises of sciences is found in Posterior Analytics II.19,\nlong regarded as a difficult text to interpret. Briefly, what he says\nthere is that it is another cognitive state, nous (translated\nvariously as “insight”, “intuition”,\n“intelligence”), which knows them. There is wide\ndisagreement among commentators about the interpretation of his\naccount of how this state is reached; I will offer one possible\ninterpretation. First, Aristotle identifies his problem as explaining\nhow the principles can “become familiar to us”, using the\nsame term “familiar” (gnôrimos) that he\nused in presenting the regress problem. What he is presenting, then,\nis not a method of discovery but a process of becoming wise. Second,\nhe says that in order for knowledge of immediate premises to be\npossible, we must have a kind of knowledge of them without having\nlearned it, but this knowledge must not be as “precise” as\nthe knowledge that a possessor of science must have. The kind of\nknowledge in question turns out to be a capacity or power\n(dunamis) which Aristotle compares to the capacity for\nsense-perception: since our senses are innate, i.e., develop\nnaturally, it is in a way correct to say that we know what e.g. all\nthe colors look like before we have seen them: we have the capacity to\nsee them by nature, and when we first see a color we exercise this\ncapacity without having to learn how to do so first. Likewise,\nAristotle holds, our minds have by nature the capacity to recognize\nthe starting points of the sciences.  \nIn the case of sensation, the capacity for perception in the sense\norgan is actualized by the operation on it of the perceptible object.\nSimilarly, Aristotle holds that coming to know first premises is a\nmatter of a potentiality in the mind being actualized by experience of\nits proper objects: “The soul is of such a nature as to be\ncapable of undergoing this”. So, although we cannot come to know\nthe first premises without the necessary experience, just as we cannot\nsee colors without the presence of colored objects, our minds are\nalready so constituted as to be able to recognize the right objects,\njust as our eyes are already so constituted as to be able to perceive\nthe colors that exist. \nIt is considerably less clear what these objects are and how it is\nthat experience actualizes the relevant potentialities in the soul.\nAristotle describes a series of stages of cognition. First is what is\ncommon to all animals: perception of what is present. Next is memory,\nwhich he regards as a retention of a sensation: only some animals have\nthis capacity. Even fewer have the next capacity, the capacity to form\na single experience (empeiria) from many repetitions of the\nsame memory. Finally, many experiences repeated give rise to knowledge\nof a single universal (katholou). This last capacity is\npresent only in humans. \nSee Section 7 of the entry on\n Aristotle’s psychology\n for more on his views about mind. \nThe definition (horos, horismos)\nwas an important matter for Plato and for the Early Academy. Concern\nwith answering the question “What is so-and-so?” are at\nthe center of the majority of Plato’s dialogues, some of which\n(most elaborately the Sophist) propound methods for finding\ndefinitions. External sources (sometimes the satirical remarks of\ncomedians) also reflect this Academic concern with definitions.\nAristotle himself traces the quest for definitions back to Socrates.\n \nFor Aristotle, a definition is “an account which signifies what\nit is to be for something” (logos ho to ti ên einai\nsêmainei). The phrase “what it is to be” and\nits variants are crucial: giving a definition is saying, of some\nexistent thing, what it is, not simply specifying the meaning of a\nword (Aristotle does recognize definitions of the latter sort, but he\nhas little interest in them).  \nThe notion of “what it is to be” for a thing is so\npervasive in Aristotle that it becomes formulaic: what a definition\nexpresses is “the what-it-is-to-be” (to ti ên\neinai), or in modern terminology, its essence.  \nSince a definition defines an essence, only what has an essence can be\ndefined. What has an essence, then? That is one of the central\nquestions of Aristotle’s metaphysics; once again, we must leave\nthe details to another article. In general, however, it is not\nindividuals but rather species (eidos: the\nword is one of those Plato uses for “Form”) that have\nessences. A species is defined by giving its genus\n(genos) and its differentia\n(diaphora): the genus is the kind under which the species\nfalls, and the differentia tells what characterizes the species within\nthat genus. As an example, human might be defined as\nanimal (the genus) having the capacity to reason\n(the differentia).  \nUnderlying Aristotle’s concept of a definition is the concept of\nessential predication (katêgoreisthai en\ntôi ti esti, predication in the what it is). In any true\naffirmative predication, the predicate either does or does not\n“say what the subject is”, i.e., the predicate either is\nor is not an acceptable answer to the question “What is\nit?” asked of the subject. Bucephalus is a horse, and a horse is\nan animal; so, “Bucephalus is a horse” and\n“Bucephalus is an animal” are essential predications.\nHowever, “Bucephalus is brown”, though true, does not\nstate what Bucephalus is but only says something about him.  \nSince a thing’s definition says what it is, definitions are\nessentially predicated. However, not everything essentially predicated\nis a definition. Since Bucephalus is a horse, and horses are a kind of\nmammal, and mammals are a kind of animal, “horse”\n“mammal” and “animal” are all essential\npredicates of Bucephalus. Moreover, since what a horse is is a kind of\nmammal, “mammal” is an essential predicate of horse. When\npredicate \\(X\\) is an essential predicate of \\(Y\\) but also of other\nthings, then \\(X\\) is a genus (genos) of\n\\(Y\\). \nA definition of \\(X\\) must not only be essentially predicated of it\nbut must also be predicated only of it: to use a term from\nAristotle’s Topics, a definition and what it defines\nmust “counterpredicate”\n(antikatêgoreisthai) with one another. \\(X\\)\ncounterpredicates with \\(Y\\) if \\(X\\) applies to what \\(Y\\) applies to\nand conversely. Though X’s definition must counterpredicate with\n\\(X\\), not everything that counterpredicates with \\(X\\) is its\ndefinition. “Capable of laughing”, for example,\ncounterpredicates with “human” but fails to be its\ndefinition. Such a predicate (non-essential but counterpredicating) is\na peculiar property or proprium\n(idion). \nFinally, if \\(X\\) is predicated of \\(Y\\) but is neither essential nor\ncounterpredicates, then \\(X\\) is an accident\n(sumbebêkos) of \\(Y\\). \nAristotle sometimes treats genus, peculiar property, definition, and\naccident as including all possible predications (e.g. Topics\nI). Later commentators listed these four and the differentia as the\nfive predicables, and as such they were of great\nimportance to late ancient and to medieval philosophy (e.g.,\nPorphyry). \nThe notion of essential predication is connected to what are\ntraditionally called the categories\n(katêgoriai). In a word, Aristotle is famous for having\nheld a “doctrine of categories”. Just what that doctrine\nwas, and indeed just what a category is, are considerably more vexing\nquestions. They also quickly take us outside his logic and into his\nmetaphysics. Here, I will try to give a very general overview,\nbeginning with the somewhat simpler question “What categories\nare there?”  \nWe can answer this question by listing the categories. Here are two\npassages containing such lists: \nOf things said without any combination, each signifies either\nsubstance or quantity or quality or a relative or where or when or\nbeing-in-a-position or having or doing or undergoing. To give a rough\nidea, examples of substance are man, horse; of quantity: four-foot,\nfive-foot; of quality: white, literate; of a relative: double, half,\nlarger; of where: in the Lyceum, in the market-place; of when:\nyesterday, last year; of being-in-a-position: is-lying, is-sitting; of\nhaving: has-shoes-on, has-armor-on; of doing: cutting, burning; of\nundergoing: being-cut, being-burned. (Categories 4,\n1b25–2a4, tr. Ackrill, slightly modified) \nThese two passages give ten-item lists, identical except for their\nfirst members. What are they lists \\(of\\)? Here are three ways they\nmight be interpreted:  \nThe word “category” (katêgoria) means\n“predication”. Aristotle holds that predications and\npredicates can be grouped into several largest “kinds of\npredication” (genê tôn\nkatêgoriôn). He refers to this classification\nfrequently, often calling the “kinds of predication”\nsimply “the predications”, and this (by way of Latin)\nleads to our word “category”. \nWhich of these interpretations fits best with the two passages above?\nThe answer appears to be different in the two cases. This is most\nevident if we take note of point in which they differ: the\nCategories lists substance (ousia)\nin first place, while the Topics list\nwhat-it-is (ti esti). A substance, for\nAristotle, is a type of entity, suggesting that the\nCategories list is a list of types of entity.  \nOn the other hand, the expression “what-it-is” suggests\nmost strongly a type of predication. Indeed, the Topics\nconfirms this by telling us that we can “say what it is”\nof an entity falling under any of the categories: \nAs Aristotle explains, if I say that Socrates is a man, then I have\nsaid what Socrates is and signified a substance; if I say that white\nis a color, then I have said what white is and signified a quality; if\nI say that some length is a foot long, then I have said what it is and\nsignified a quantity; and so on for the other categories. What-it-is,\nthen, here designates a kind of predication, not a kind of entity.\n \nThis might lead us to conclude that the categories in the\nTopics are only to be interpreted as kinds of predicate or\npredication, those in the Categories as kinds of being. Even\nso, we would still want to ask what the relationship is between these\ntwo nearly-identical lists of terms, given these distinct\ninterpretations. However, the situation is much more complicated.\nFirst, there are dozens of other passages in which the categories\nappear. Nowhere else do we find a list of ten, but we do find shorter\nlists containing eight, or six, or five, or four of them (with\nsubstance/what-it-is, quality, quantity, and relative the most\ncommon). Aristotle describes what these lists are lists of in\ndifferent ways: they tell us “how being is divided”, or\n“how many ways being is said”, or “the figures of\npredication” (ta schêmata tês katêgorias). The\ndesignation of the first category also varies: we find not only\n“substance” and “what it is” but also the\nexpressions “this” or “the this” (tode\nti, to tode, to ti). These latter expressions\nare closely associated with, but not synonymous with, substance. He\neven combines the latter with “what-it-is”\n(Metaphysics Z 1, 1028a10: “… one sense\nsignifies what it is and the this, one signifies quality\n…”). \nMoreover, substances are for Aristotle fundamental for predication as\nwell as metaphysically fundamental. He tells us that everything that\nexists exists because substances exist: if there were no substances,\nthere would not be anything else. He also conceives of predication as\nreflecting a metaphysical relationship (or perhaps more than one,\ndepending on the type of predication). The sentence “Socrates is\npale” gets its truth from a state of affairs consisting of a\nsubstance (Socrates) and a quality (whiteness) which is in that\nsubstance. At this point we have gone far outside the realm of\nAristotle’s logic into his metaphysics, the fundamental question\nof which, according to Aristotle, is “What is a\nsubstance?”. (For further discussion of this topic, see the\nentry on\n Aristotle’s Categories\n and the entry on\n Aristotle’s metaphysics,\n (Section 2). \nSee Frede 1981, Ebert 1985 for additional discussion of\nAristotle’s lists of categories. \nFor convenience of reference, I include a table of the categories,\nalong with Aristotle’s examples and the traditional names often\nused for them. For reasons explained above, I have treated the first\nitem in the list quite differently, since an example of a substance\nand an example of a what-it-is are necessarily (as one might put it)\nin different categories. \nIn the Sophist, Plato introduces a procedure of\n“Division” as a method for discovering definitions. To\nfind a definition of \\(X\\), first locate the largest kind of thing\nunder which \\(X\\) falls; then, divide that kind into two parts, and\ndecide which of the two \\(X\\) falls into. Repeat this method with the\npart until \\(X\\) has been fully located.  \nThis method is part of Aristotle’s Platonic legacy. His attitude\ntowards it, however, is complex. He adopts a view of the proper\nstructure of definitions that is closely allied to it: a correct\ndefinition of \\(X\\) should give the genus\n(genos: kind or family) of \\(X\\), which tells what kind of\nthing \\(X\\) is, and the differentia\n(diaphora: difference) which uniquely identifies \\(X\\) within\nthat genus. Something defined in this way is a\nspecies (eidos: the term is one of\nPlato’s terms for “Form”), and the differentia is\nthus the “difference that makes a species” (eidopoios\ndiaphora, “specific difference”). In Posterior\nAnalytics II.13, he gives his own account of the use of Division\nin finding definitions. \nHowever, Aristotle is strongly critical of the Platonic view of\nDivision as a method for establishing definitions. In\nPrior Analytics I.31, he contrasts Division with the\nsyllogistic method he has just presented, arguing that Division cannot\nactually prove anything but rather assumes the very thing it is\nsupposed to be proving. He also charges that the partisans of Division\nfailed to understand what their own method was capable of proving. \nClosely related to this is the discussion, in Posterior\nAnalytics II.3–10, of the question whether there can be\nboth definition and demonstration of the same thing (that is, whether\nthe same result can be established either by definition or by\ndemonstration). Since the definitions Aristotle is interested in are\nstatements of essences, knowing a definition is knowing, of some\nexisting thing, what it is. Consequently, Aristotle’s question\namounts to a question whether defining and demonstrating can be\nalternative ways of acquiring the same knowledge. His reply is\ncomplex:  \nAs an example of case 3, Aristotle considers the definition\n“Thunder is the extinction of fire in the clouds”. He sees\nthis as a compressed and rearranged form of this demonstration:  \nWe can see the connection by considering the answers to two questions:\n“What is thunder?” “The extinction of fire in the\nclouds” (definition). “Why does it thunder?”\n“Because fire is extinguished in the clouds”\n(demonstration).  \nAs with his criticisms of Division, Aristotle is arguing for the\nsuperiority of his own concept of science to the Platonic concept.\nKnowledge is composed of demonstrations, even if it may also include\ndefinitions; the method of science is demonstrative, even if it may\nalso include the process of defining. \nAristotle often contrasts dialectical arguments with\ndemonstrations. The difference, he tells us, is in the character of\ntheir premises, not in their logical structure: whether an argument is\na sullogismos is only a matter of whether its conclusion\nresults of necessity from its premises. The premises of demonstrations\nmust be true and primary, that is, not only true but also\nprior to their conclusions in the way explained in the Posterior\nAnalytics. The premises of dialectical deductions, by contrast,\nmust be accepted (endoxos).  \nRecent scholars have proposed different interpretations of the term\nendoxos. Aristotle often uses this adjective as a\nsubstantive: ta endoxa, “accepted things”,\n“accepted opinions”. On one understanding, descended from\nthe work of G. E. L. Owen and developed more fully by Jonathan Barnes\nand especially Terence Irwin, the endoxa are a compilation of\nviews held by various people with some form or other of standing:\n“the views of fairly reflective people after some\nreflection”, in Irwin’s phrase. Dialectic is then simply\n“a method of argument from [the] common beliefs [held by these\npeople]”. For Irwin, then, endoxa are “common\nbeliefs”. Jonathan Barnes, noting that endoxa are\nopinions with a certain standing, translates with\n“reputable”.  \nMy own view is that Aristotle’s texts support a somewhat\ndifferent understanding. He also tells us that dialectical premises\ndiffer from demonstrative ones in that the former are\nquestions, whereas the latter are assumptions or\nassertions: “the demonstrator does not ask, but\ntakes”, he says. This fits most naturally with a view of\ndialectic as argument directed at another person by question and\nanswer and consequently taking as premises that other person’s\nconcessions. Anyone arguing in this manner will, in order to be\nsuccessful, have to ask for premises which the interlocutor is liable\nto accept, and the best way to be successful at that is to have an\ninventory of acceptable premises, i.e., premises that are in fact\nacceptable to people of different types. \nIn fact, we can discern in the Topics (and the\nRhetoric, which Aristotle says depends on the art explained\nin the Topics) an art of dialectic for use in such arguments.\nMy reconstruction of this art (which would not be accepted by all\nscholars) is as follows. \nGiven the above picture of dialectical argument, the dialectical art\nwill consist of two elements. One will be a method for discovering\npremises from which a given conclusion follows, while the other will\nbe a method for determining which premises a given interlocutor will\nbe likely to concede. The first task is accomplished by developing a\nsystem for classifying premises according to their logical structure.\nWe might expect Aristotle to avail himself here of the syllogistic,\nbut in fact he develops quite another approach, one that seems less\nsystematic and rests on various “common” terms. The second\ntask is accomplished by developing lists of the premises which are\nacceptable to various types of interlocutor. Then, once one knows what\nsort of person one is dealing with, one can choose premises\naccordingly. Aristotle stresses that, as in all arts, the dialectician\nmust study, not what is acceptable to this or that specific person,\nbut what is acceptable to this or that type of person, just as the\ndoctor studies what is healthful for different types of person:\n“art is of the universal”.  \nThe method presented in the Topics for classifying arguments\nrelies on the presence in the conclusion of certain\n“common” terms (koina) — common in the\nsense that they are not peculiar to any subject matter but may play a\nrole in arguments about anything whatever. We find enumerations of\narguments involving these terms in a similar order several times.\nTypically, they include:  \nThe four types of opposites are the best represented.\nEach designates a type of term pair, i.e., a way two terms can be\nopposed to one another. Contraries are polar\nopposites or opposed extremes such as hot and cold, dry and wet, good\nand bad. A pair of contradictories consists of a term\nand its negation: good, not good. A possession (or\ncondition) and privation are illustrated by sight and\nblindness. Relatives are relative terms in the modern\nsense: a pair consists of a term and its correlative, e.g. large and\nsmall, parent and child.  \nThe argumentative patterns Aristotle associated with\ncases generally involve inferring a sentence\ncontaining adverbial or declined forms from another sentence containing\ndifferent forms of the same word stem: “if what is useful is\ngood, then what is done usefully is done well and the useful person is\ngood”. In Hellenistic grammatical usage, ptôsis\nmeant “case” (e.g. nominative, dative, accusative);\nAristotle’s use here is obviously an early form of that. \nUnder the heading more and less and likewise,\nAristotle groups a somewhat motley assortment of argument patterns all\ninvolving, in some way or other, the terms “more”,\n“less”, and “likewise”. Examples: “If\nwhatever is \\(A\\) is \\(B\\), then whatever is more (less) \\(A\\) is more\n(less) \\(B\\)”; “If \\(A\\) is more likely \\(B\\) than \\(C\\)\nis, and \\(A\\) is not \\(B\\), then neither is \\(C\\)”; “If\n\\(A\\) is more likely than \\(B\\) and \\(B\\) is the case, then \\(A\\) is\nthe case”. \nAt the heart of the Topics is a collection of what Aristotle\ncalls topoi, “places” or “locations”.\nUnfortunately, though it is clear that he intends most of the\nTopics (Books II–VI) as a collection of these, he never\nexplicitly defines this term. Interpreters have consequently disagreed\nconsiderably about just what a topos is. Discussions may be\nfound in Brunschwig 1967, Slomkowski 1996, Primavesi 1997, and Smith\n1997.  \nAn art of dialectic will be useful wherever dialectical\nargument is useful. Aristotle mentions three such uses; each merits\nsome comment.  \nFirst, there appears to have been a form of stylized argumentative\nexchange practiced in the Academy in Aristotle’s time. The main\nevidence for this is simply Aristotle’s Topics,\nespecially Book VIII, which makes frequent reference to rule-governed\nprocedures, apparently taking it for granted that the audience will\nunderstand them. In these exchanges, one participant took the role of\nanswerer, the other the role of questioner. The answerer began by\nasserting some proposition (a thesis: “position”\nor “acceptance”). The questioner then asked questions of\nthe answerer in an attempt to secure concessions from which a\ncontradiction could be deduced: that is, to refute\n(elenchein) the answerer’s position. The questioner was\nlimited to questions that could be answered by yes or no; generally,\nthe answerer could only respond with yes or no, though in some cases\nanswerers could object to the form of a question. Answerers might\nundertake to answer in accordance with the views of a particular type\nof person or a particular person (e.g. a famous philosopher), or they\nmight answer according to their own beliefs. There appear to have been\njudges or scorekeepers for the process. Gymnastic dialectical contests\nwere sometimes, as the name suggests, for the sake of exercise in\ndeveloping argumentative skill, but they may also have been pursued as\na part of a process of inquiry.  \nAristotle also mentions an “art of making trial”, or a\nvariety of dialectical argument that “puts to the test”\n(the Greek word is the adjective peirastikê, in the\nfeminine: such expressions often designate arts or skills, e.g.\nrhêtorikê, “the art of rhetoric”).\nIts function is to examine the claims of those who say they have some\nknowledge, and it can be practiced by someone who does not possess the\nknowledge in question. The examination is a matter of refutation,\nbased on the principle that whoever knows a subject must have\nconsistent beliefs about it: so, if you can show me that my beliefs\nabout something lead to a contradiction, then you have shown that I do\nnot have knowledge about it.  \nThis is strongly reminiscent of Socrates’ style of\ninterrogation, from which it is almost certainly descended. In fact,\nAristotle often indicates that dialectical argument is by nature\nrefutative. \nDialectical refutation cannot of itself establish any proposition\n(except perhaps the proposition that some set of propositions is\ninconsistent). More to the point, though deducing a contradiction from\nmy beliefs may show that they do not constitute knowledge, failure to\ndeduce a contradiction from them is no proof that they are true. Not\nsurprisingly, then, Aristotle often insists that “dialectic does\nnot prove anything” and that the dialectical art is not some\nsort of universal knowledge.  \nIn Topics I.2, however, Aristotle says that the art of\ndialectic is useful in connection with “the philosophical\nsciences”. One reason he gives for this follows closely on the\nrefutative function: if we have subjected our opinions (and the\nopinions of our fellows, and of the wise) to a thorough refutative\nexamination, we will be in a much better position to judge what is\nmost likely true and false. In fact, we find just such a procedure at\nthe start of many of Aristotle’s treatises: an enumeration of\nthe opinions current about the subject together with a compilation of\n“puzzles” raised by these opinions. Aristotle has a\nspecial term for this kind of review: a diaporia, a\n“puzzling through”. \nHe adds a second use that is both more difficult to understand and\nmore intriguing. The Posterior Analytics argues that if\nanything can be proved, then not everything that is known is known as\na result of proof. What alternative means is there whereby the first\nprinciples of sciences are known? Aristotle’s own answer as\nfound in Posterior Analytics II.19 is difficult to interpret,\nand recent philosophers have often found it unsatisfying since (as\noften construed) it appears to commit Aristotle to a form of apriorism\nor rationalism both indefensible in itself and not consonant with his\nown insistence on the indispensability of empirical inquiry in natural\nscience. \nAgainst this background, the following passage in Topics I.2\nmay have special importance: \nA number of interpreters (beginning with Owen 1961) have built on this\npassage and others to find dialectic at the heart of Aristotle’s\nphilosophical method. Further discussion of this issue would take us\nfar beyond the subject of this article (the fullest development is in\nIrwin 1988; see also Nussbaum 1986 and Bolton 1990; for criticism,\nHamlyn 1990, Smith 1997).  \nAristotle says that rhetoric, i.e., the study of persuasive speech, is\na “counterpart” (antistrophos) of dialectic and\nthat the rhetorical art is a kind of “outgrowth”\n(paraphues ti) of dialectic and the study of character types.\nThe correspondence with dialectical method is straightforward:\nrhetorical speeches, like dialectical arguments, seek to persuade\nothers to accept certain conclusions on the basis of premises they\nalready accept. Therefore, the same measures useful in dialectical\ncontexts will, mutatis mutandis, be useful here: knowing what premises\nan audience of a given type is likely to believe, and knowing how to\nfind premises from which the desired conclusion follows.  \nThe Rhetoric does fit this general description: Aristotle\nincludes both discussions of types of person or audience (with\ngeneralizations about what each type tends to believe) and a summary\nversion (in II.23) of the argument patterns discussed in the\nTopics. For further discussion of his rhetoric see\n Aristotle’s rhetoric. \nDemonstrations and dialectical arguments are both forms of valid\nargument, for Aristotle. However, he also studies what he calls\ncontentious (eristikos) or\nsophistical arguments: these he defines as arguments\nwhich only apparently establish their conclusions. In fact, Aristotle\ndefines these as apparent (but not genuine) dialectical\nsullogismoi. They may have this appearance in either of two\nways:  \nArguments of the first type in modern terms, appear to be valid but\nare really invalid. Arguments of the second type are at first more\nperplexing: given that acceptability is a matter of what people\nbelieve, it might seem that whatever appears to be endoxos\nmust actually be endoxos. However, Aristotle probably has in\nmind arguments with premises that may at first glance seem to\nbe acceptable but which, upon a moment’s reflection, we\nimmediately realize we do not actually accept. Consider this example\nfrom Aristotle’s time:  \nThis is transparently bad, but the problem is not that it is invalid:\nthe problem is rather that the first premise, though superficially\nplausible, is false. In fact, anyone with a little ability to follow\nan argument will realize that at once upon seeing this very argument.\n \nAristotle’s study of sophistical arguments is contained in\nOn Sophistical Refutations, which is actually a sort of\nappendix to the Topics. \nTo a remarkable extent, contemporary discussions of fallacies\nreproduce Aristotle’s own classifications. See Dorion 1995 for\nfurther discussion. \nTwo frequent themes of Aristotle’s account of science are (1)\nthat the first principles of sciences are not demonstrable and (2)\nthat there is no single universal science including all other sciences\nas its parts. “All things are not in a single genus”, he\nsays, “and even if they were, all beings could not fall under\nthe same principles” (On Sophistical Refutations 11).\nThus, it is exactly the universal applicability of dialectic that\nleads him to deny it the status of a science.  \nIn Metaphysics IV \\((\\Gamma)\\), however, Aristotle takes what\nappears to be a different view. First, he argues that there is, in a\nway, a science that takes being as its genus (his name for it is\n“first philosophy”). Second, he argues that the principles\nof this science will be, in a way, the first principles of all (though\nhe does not claim that the principles of other sciences can be\ndemonstrated from them). Third, he identifies one of its first\nprinciples as the “most secure” of all principles: the\nprinciple of non-contradiction. As he states it, \nThis is the most secure of all principles, Aristotle tells us, because\n“it is impossible to be in error about it”. Since it is a\nfirst principle, it cannot be demonstrated; those who think otherwise\nare “uneducated in analytics”. However, Aristotle then\nproceeds to give what he calls a “refutative\ndemonstration” (apodeixai elenktikôs) of this\nprinciple.  \nFurther discussion of this principle and Aristotle’s arguments\nconcerning it belong to a treatment of his metaphysics (see\n Aristotle: Metaphysics).\n However, it should be noted that: (1) these arguments draw on\nAristotle’s views about logic to a greater extent than any\ntreatise outside the logical works themselves; (2) in the logical\nworks, the principle of non-contradiction is one of Aristotle’s\nfavorite illustrations of the “common principles”\n(koinai archai) that underlie the art of dialectic. \nSee\n Aristotle’s Metaphysics,\n Aristotle on non-contradiction, Dancy 1975, and Code 1986 for further discussion. \nThe passage in Aristotle’s logical works which has received\nperhaps the most intense discussion in recent decades is On\nInterpretation 9, where Aristotle discusses the question whether\nevery proposition about the future must be either true or false.\nThough something of a side issue in its context, the passage raises a\nproblem of great importance to Aristotle’s near contemporaries\n(and perhaps contemporaries).  \nA contradiction (antiphasis) is a pair of\npropositions one of which asserts what the other denies. A major goal\nof On Interpretation is to discuss the thesis that, of every\nsuch contradiction, one member must be true and the other false. In\nthe course of his discussion, Aristotle allows for some exceptions.\nOne case is what he calls indefinite propositions\nsuch as “A man is walking”: nothing prevents both this\nproposition and “A man is not walking” being\nsimultaneously true. This exception can be explained on relatively\nsimple grounds. \nA different exception arises for more complex reasons. Consider these\ntwo propositions: \nIt seems that exactly one of these must be true and the other false.\nBut if (1) is now true, then there must be a\nsea-battle tomorrow, and there cannot fail to be a sea-battle\ntomorrow. The result, according to this puzzle, is that nothing is\npossible except what actually happens: there are no unactualized\npossibilities.  \nSuch a conclusion is, as Aristotle is quick to note, a problem both\nfor his own metaphysical views about potentialities and for the\ncommonsense notion that some things are up to us. He therefore\nproposes another exception to the general thesis concerning\ncontradictory pairs. \nThis much would probably be accepted by most interpreters. What the\nrestriction is, however, and just what motivates it are matters of\nwide disagreement. It has been proposed, for instance, that Aristotle\nadopted, or at least flirted with, a three-valued logic for future\npropositions, or that he countenanced truth-value gaps, or that his\nsolution includes still more abstruse reasoning. The literature is\nmuch too complex to summarize: see Anscombe, Hintikka, D. Frede,\nWhitaker, Waterlow. \nHistorically, at least, it is likely that Aristotle is responding to\nan argument originating with the Megarian philosophers. He ascribes\nthe view that only that which happens is possible to the Megarians in\nMetaphysics IX \\((\\Theta)\\). The puzzle with which he is\nconcerned strongly recalls the “Master Argument” of\n Diodorus Cronus\n especially in certain further details. For instance, Aristotle\nimagines the statement about tomorrow’s sea battle having been\nuttered ten thousand years ago. If it was true, then its truth was a\nfact about the past; if the past is now unchangeable, then so is the\ntruth value of that past utterance. This recalls the Master\nArgument’s premise that “what is past is necessary”.\nDiodorus Cronus was active a little after Aristotle, and he was\ncertainly influenced by Megarian views, whether or not it is correct\nto call him a Megarian (David Sedley 1977 argues that he was instead a\nmember of the\n Dialectical School\n which was in any event an offshoot of the Megarians; see Dorion 1995\nand Döring 1989, Ebert 2008 and the article Dialectical School).\nIt is therefore likely that Aristotle’s target here is some\nMegarian argument, perhaps a forerunner of Diodorus’ Master\nArgument.","contact.mail":"rasmith@apacentral.org","contact.domain":"apacentral.org"}]
