He continues to influence current\nphilosophical thought in topics as diverse as logic and language,\nperception and intention, ethics and religion, aesthetics and culture.\nOriginally, there were two commonly recognized stages of\nWittgenstein’s thought—the early and the later—both\nof which were taken to be pivotal in their respective periods. In more\nrecent scholarship, this division has been questioned: some\ninterpreters have claimed a unity between all stages of his thought,\nwhile others talk of a more nuanced division, adding stages such as\nthe middle Wittgenstein and the third Wittgenstein. Still, it is\ncommonly acknowledged that the early Wittgenstein is epitomized in his\nTractatus Logico-Philosophicus. By showing the application of\nmodern logic to metaphysics, via language, he provided new insights\ninto the relations between world, thought and language and thereby into\nthe nature of philosophy. It is the later Wittgenstein, mostly\nrecognized in the Philosophical Investigations, who took the\nmore revolutionary step in critiquing all of traditional philosophy\nincluding its climax in his own early work. The nature of his new\nphilosophy is heralded as anti-systematic through and through, yet\nstill conducive to genuine philosophical understanding of traditional\nproblems.\n\n\nWittgenstein was born on April 26, 1889 in Vienna, Austria, to a\nwealthy industrial family, well-situated in intellectual and cultural\nViennese circles. In 1908 he began his studies in aeronautical\nengineering at Manchester University where his interest in the\nphilosophy of pure mathematics led him to Frege. Upon Frege’s\nadvice, in 1911 he went to Cambridge to study with Bertrand\nRussell. Russell wrote, upon meeting Wittgenstein: “An unknown\nGerman appeared … obstinate and perverse, but I think not\nstupid” (quoted by Monk 1990: 38f). Within one year, Russell was\ncommitted: “I shall certainly encourage him. Perhaps he will do\ngreat things … I love him and feel he will solve the problems I\nam too old to solve” (quoted by Monk 1990: 41). Russell’s\ninsight was accurate. Wittgenstein was idiosyncratic in his habits and\nway of life, yet profoundly acute in his philosophical\nsensitivity. \n\nDuring his years in Cambridge, from 1911 to 1913, Wittgenstein\nconducted several conversations on philosophy and the foundations of\nlogic with Russell, with whom he had an emotional and intense\nrelationship, as well as with Moore and Keynes. He retreated to\nisolation in Norway, for months at a time, in order to ponder these\nphilosophical problems and to work out their solutions. In 1913 he\nreturned to Austria and in 1914, at the start of World War I\n(1914–1918), joined the Austrian army. He was taken captive in 1918\nand spent the remaining months of the war at a prison camp. It was\nduring the war that he wrote the notes and drafts of his first\nimportant work, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. After the war\nthe book was published in German and translated into English. \n\nIn 1920 Wittgenstein, now divorced from philosophy (having, to his\nmind, solved all philosophical problems in the Tractatus),\ngave away his part of his family’s fortune and pursued several\n‘professions’ (gardener, teacher, architect, etc.) in and\naround Vienna. It was only in 1929 that he returned to Cambridge to\nresume his philosophical vocation, after having been exposed to\ndiscussions on the philosophy of mathematics and science with members\nof the Vienna Circle, whose conception of logical empiricism was\nindebted to his Tractatus account of logic as tautologous,\nand his philosophy as concerned with logical syntax. During these\nfirst years in Cambridge his conception of philosophy and its problems\nunderwent dramatic changes that are recorded in several volumes of\nconversations, lecture notes, and letters (e.g., Ludwig\nWittgenstein and the Vienna Circle, The Blue and Brown\nBooks, Philosophical Grammar).  Sometimes termed the\n‘middle Wittgenstein’, this period heralds a rejection of\ndogmatic philosophy, including both traditional works and the\nTractatus itself. \n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s Wittgenstein conducted seminars at\nCambridge, developing most of the ideas that he intended to publish in\nhis second book, Philosophical Investigations. These included\nthe turn from formal logic to ordinary language, novel reflections on\npsychology and mathematics, and a general skepticism concerning\nphilosophy’s pretensions. In 1945 he prepared the final manuscript of\nthe Philosophical Investigations, but, at the last minute,\nwithdrew it from publication (and only authorized its posthumous\npublication). For a few more years he continued his philosophical work,\nbut this is marked by a rich development of, rather than a turn away\nfrom, his second phase. He traveled during this period to the United\nStates and Ireland, and returned to Cambridge, where he was diagnosed\nwith cancer. Legend has it that, at his death in 1951, his last words\nwere “Tell them I’ve had a wonderful life” (Monk: 579). \nTractatus Logico-Philosophicus was first published in German\nin 1921 and then translated—by C.K. Ogden, with\nF. P. Ramsey’s help—and published in English in 1922. It\nwas later re-translated by D.  F. Pears and B. F. McGuinness. Coming\nout of Wittgenstein’s Notes on Logic (1913),\n“Notes Dictated to G. E. Moore” (1914),\nhis Notebooks, written in 1914–16, and further correspondence\nwith Russell, Moore and Keynes, and showing Schopenhauerian and other\ncultural influences, it evolved as a continuation of and reaction to\nRussell and Frege’s conceptions of logic and language. Russell\nsupplied an introduction to the book claiming that it “certainly\ndeserves … to be considered an important event in the\nphilosophical world.” It is fascinating to note that\nWittgenstein thought little of Russell’s introduction, claiming\nthat it was riddled with misunderstandings. Later interpretations have\nattempted to unearth the surprising tensions between the introduction\nand the rest of the book (or between Russell’s reading of\nWittgenstein and Wittgenstein’s own\nself-assessment)—usually harping on Russell’s\nappropriation of Wittgenstein for his own agenda.  \n\nThe Tractatus’s structure purports to be representative of\nits internal essence. It is constructed around seven basic\npropositions, numbered by the natural numbers 1–7, with all other\nparagraphs in the text numbered by decimal expansions so that, e.g.,\nparagraph 1.1 is (supposed to be) a further elaboration on proposition\n1, 1.22 is an elaboration of 1.2, and so on. \n\nThe seven basic propositions are: \n\nClearly, the book addresses the central problems of philosophy which\ndeal with the world, thought and language, and presents a ‘solution’\n(as Wittgenstein terms it) of these problems that is grounded in logic\nand in the nature of representation. The world is represented by\nthought, which is a proposition with sense, since they all—world,\nthought, and proposition—share the same logical form. Hence, the\nthought and the proposition can be pictures of the facts. \n\nStarting with a seeming metaphysics, Wittgenstein sees the world as\nconsisting of facts (1), rather than the traditional, atomistic\nconception of a world made up of objects. Facts are existent states of\naffairs (2) and states of affairs, in turn, are combinations of\nobjects. “Objects are simple” (TLP\n2.02) but objects can fit together in various determinate ways. They\nmay have various properties and may hold diverse relations to one\nanother.  Objects combine with one another according to their logical,\ninternal properties. That is to say, an object’s internal properties\ndetermine the possibilities of its combination with other objects;\nthis is its logical form. Thus, states of affairs, being comprised of\nobjects in combination, are inherently complex. The states of affairs\nwhich do exist could have been otherwise. This means that states of\naffairs are either actual (existent) or possible. It is the totality\nof states of affairs—actual and possible—that makes up\nthe whole of reality.  The world is precisely those states of affairs\nwhich do exist. \n\nThe move to thought, and thereafter to language, is perpetrated with\nthe use of Wittgenstein’s famous idea that thoughts, and propositions,\nare pictures—“the picture is a model of reality” (TLP\n2.12). Pictures are made up of elements that together constitute the\npicture. Each element represents an object, and the combination of\nelements in the picture represents the combination of objects in a\nstate of affairs. The logical structure of the picture, whether in\nthought or in language, is isomorphic with the logical structure of\nthe state of affairs which it pictures. More subtle is Wittgenstein’s\ninsight that the possibility of this structure being shared by the\npicture (the thought, the proposition) and the state of affairs is the\npictorial form. “That is how a picture is attached to\nreality; it reaches right out to it” (TLP 2.1511). This leads\nto an understanding of what the picture can picture; but also what it\ncannot—its own pictorial form. \n\nWhile “the logical picture of the facts is the thought” (3), in the\nmove to language Wittgenstein continues to investigate the\npossibilities of significance for propositions (4). Logical analysis,\nin the spirit of Frege and Russell, guides the work, with Wittgenstein\nusing logical calculus to carry out the construction of his system.\nExplaining that “Only the proposition has sense; only in the context of\na proposition has a name meaning” (TLP 3.3), he provides the\nreader with the two conditions for sensical language. First, the\nstructure of the proposition must conform to the constraints of\nlogical form, and second, the elements of the proposition must have\nreference (bedeutung). These conditions have far-reaching\nimplications. The analysis must culminate with a name being a primitive\nsymbol for a (simple) object. Moreover, logic itself gives us the\nstructure and limits of what can be said at all. \n\n“The general form of a proposition is: This is how things\nstand” (TLP 4.5) and every proposition is either true\nor false. This bi-polarity of propositions enables the composition of\nmore complex propositions from atomic ones by using truth-functional\noperators (5). Wittgenstein supplies, in the Tractatus, a\nvivid presentation of Frege’s logic in the form of what has become\nknown as ‘truth-tables’. This provides the means to go\nback and analyze all propositions into their atomic parts, since\n“every statement about complexes can be analyzed into a\nstatement about their constituent parts, and into those propositions\nwhich completely describe the complexes” (TLP\n2.0201). He delves even deeper by then providing the general form of a\ntruth-function (6). This form, \\([\\bar{p}, \\bar{\\xi}, N(\\bar{\\xi})]\\),\nmakes use of one formal operation \\((N(\\bar{\\xi}))\\)\nand one propositional variable \\((\\bar{p})\\)\nto represent Wittgenstein’s claim that any proposition “is the result\nof successive applications” of logical operations to elementary\npropositions. \n\nHaving developed this analysis of world-thought-language, and\nrelying on the one general form of the proposition, Wittgenstein can\nnow assert that all meaningful propositions are of equal value.\nSubsequently, he ends the journey with the admonition concerning what\ncan (or cannot) and what should (or should not) be said (7), leaving\noutside the realm of the sayable propositions of ethics, aesthetics,\nand metaphysics. \n\nIn the Tractatus Wittgenstein’s logical construction of a\nphilosophical system has a purpose—to find the limits of\nworld, thought and language; in other words, to distinguish between\nsense and nonsense. “The book will … draw a limit to thinking,\nor rather—not to thinking, but to the expression of thoughts\n…. The limit can … only be drawn in language and what\nlies on the other side of the limit will be simply nonsense”\n(TLP Preface). The conditions for a proposition’s having\nsense have been explored and seen to rest on the possibility of\nrepresentation or picturing. Names must have a bedeutung\n(reference/meaning), but they can only do so in the context of a\nproposition which is held together by logical form. It follows that\nonly factual states of affairs which can be pictured can be\nrepresented by meaningful propositions. This means that what can be\nsaid are only propositions of natural science and leaves out of the\nrealm of sense a daunting number of statements which are made and used\nin language. \n\nThere are, first, the propositions of logic itself. These do not\nrepresent states of affairs, and the logical constants do not stand\nfor objects.  “My fundamental thought is that the logical\nconstants do not represent.  That the logic of the facts\ncannot be represented” (TLP 4.0312). This is not a\nhappenstance thought; it is fundamental precisely because the limits\nof sense rest on logic.  Tautologies and contradictions, the\npropositions of logic, are the limits of language and thought, and\nthereby the limits of the world.  Obviously, then, they do not picture\nanything and do not, therefore, have sense. They are, in\nWittgenstein’s terms, senseless (sinnlos). Propositions which\ndo have sense are bipolar; they range within the truth-conditions\ndrawn by the truth-tables.  But the propositions of logic themselves\nare “not pictures of the reality … for the one\nallows every possible state of affairs, the\nother none” (TLP 4.462). Indeed, tautologies\n(and contradictions), being senseless, are recognized as true (or\nfalse) “in the symbol alone … and this fact contains in\nitself the whole philosophy of logic” (TLP 6.113). \n\nThe characteristic of being senseless applies not only to the\npropositions of logic but also to mathematics or the pictorial form itself of the\npictures that do represent. These are, like tautologies and\ncontradictions, literally sense-less, they have no sense. \n\nBeyond, or aside from, senseless propositions Wittgenstein identifies\nanother group of statements which cannot carry sense: the nonsensical\n(unsinnig) propositions. Nonsense, as opposed to\nsenselessness, is encountered when a proposition is even more\nradically devoid of meaning, when it transcends the bounds of\nsense. Under the label of unsinnig can be found various\npropositions: “Socrates is identical”, but also “1\nis a number” and “there are objects”. While some\nnonsensical propositions are blatantly so, others seem to be\nmeaningful—and only analysis carried out in accordance with the\npicture theory can expose their nonsensicality. Since only what is\n“in” the world can be described, anything that is\n“higher” is excluded, including the notion of limit and\nthe limit points themselves. Traditional metaphysics, and the\npropositions of ethics and aesthetics, which try to capture the world\nas a whole, are also excluded, as is the truth in solipsism, the very\nnotion of a subject, for it is also not “in” the world but\nat its limit. \n\nWittgenstein does not, however, relegate all that is not inside the\nbounds of sense to oblivion. He makes a distinction between\nsaying and showing which is made to do additional\ncrucial work. “What can be shown cannot be said,” that is,\nwhat cannot be formulated in sayable (sensical) propositions can only\nbe shown. This applies, for example, to the logical form of the world,\nthe pictorial form, etc., which show themselves in the form of\n(contingent) propositions, in the symbolism, and in logical\npropositions. Even the unsayable (metaphysical, ethical, aesthetic)\npropositions of philosophy belong in this group—which\nWittgenstein finally describes as “things that cannot be put\ninto words. They make themselves manifest. They are what is\nmystical” (TLP 6.522). \n\nAccordingly, “the word ‘philosophy’ must mean something\nwhich stands above or below, but not beside the natural sciences”\n(TLP 4.111). Not surprisingly, then, “most of the\npropositions and questions to be found in philosophical works are not\nfalse but nonsensical” (TLP 4.003). Is, then, philosophy\ndoomed to be nonsense (unsinnig), or, at best, senseless\n(sinnlos) when it does logic, but, in any case, meaningless?\nWhat is left for the philosopher to do, if traditional, or even\nrevolutionary, propositions of metaphysics, epistemology, aesthetics,\nand ethics cannot be formulated in a sensical manner? The reply to\nthese two questions is found in Wittgenstein’s characterization of\nphilosophy: philosophy is not a theory, or a doctrine, but rather an\nactivity. It is an activity of clarification (of thoughts), and more\nso, of critique (of language).  Described by Wittgenstein, it should\nbe the philosopher’s routine activity: to react or respond to the\ntraditional philosophers’ musings by showing them where they go wrong,\nusing the tools provided by logical analysis. In other words, by\nshowing them that (some of) their propositions are nonsense. \n\n“All propositions are of equal value” (TLP 6.4)—that\ncould also be the fundamental thought of the book. For it employs a\nmeasure of the value of propositions that is done by logic and the\nnotion of limits. It is here, however, with the constraints on the\nvalue of propositions, that the tension in the Tractatus is\nmost strongly felt. It becomes clear that the notions used by the\nTractatus—the logical-philosophical notions—do\nnot belong to the world and hence cannot be used to express anything\nmeaningful. Since language, thought and the world, are all isomorphic,\nany attempt to say in logic (i.e., in language) “this and this there\nis in the world, that there is not” is doomed to be a failure, since\nit would mean that logic has got outside the limits of the world,\ni.e. of itself. That is to say, the Tractatus has gone over\nits own limits, and stands in danger of being nonsensical. \n\nThe “solution” to this tension is found in Wittgenstein’s final\nremarks, where he uses the metaphor of the ladder to express the\nfunction of the Tractatus. It is to be used in order to climb\non it, in order to “see the world rightly”; but thereafter it must be\nrecognized as nonsense and be thrown away. Hence: “whereof one cannot\nspeak, thereof one must be silent” (7). \n\nThe Tractatus is notorious for its interpretative\ndifficulties. In the decades that have passed since its\npublication it has gone through several waves of general\ninterpretations. Beyond exegetical and hermeneutical issues that\nrevolve around particular sections (such as the world/reality\ndistinction, the difference between representing and presenting, the\nFrege/Russell connection to Wittgenstein, or the influence on\nWittgenstein by existentialist philosophy) there are a few\nfundamental, not unrelated, disagreements that inform the map of\ninterpretation.  These revolve around the realism of the\nTractatus, the notion of nonsense and its role in reading the\nTractatus itself, and the reading of the Tractatus\nas an ethical tract. \n\nThere are interpretations that see the Tractatus as espousing\nrealism, i.e., as positing the independent existence of objects,\nstates of affairs, and facts. That this realism is achieved via a\nlinguistic turn is recognized by all (or most) interpreters, but this\nlinguistic perspective does no damage to the basic realism that is\nseen to start off the Tractatus (“The world is all that is\nthe case”) and to run throughout the text (“Objects form the substance\nof the world” (TLP 2.021)). Such realism is also taken to be\nmanifested in the essential bi-polarity of propositions; likewise, a\nstraightforward reading of the picturing relation posits objects there\nto be represented by signs. As against these readings, more\nlinguistically oriented interpretations give conceptual priority to\nthe symbolism. When “reality is compared with propositions”\n(TLP 4.05), it is the form of propositions which determines\nthe shape of reality (and not the other way round). In any case, the\nissue of realism (vs. anti-realism) in the Tractatus must\naddress the question of the limits of language and the more particular\nquestion of what there is (or is not) beyond language. Subsequently,\ninterpreters of the Tractatus have moved on to questioning\nthe very presence of metaphysics within the book and the status of the\npropositions of the book themselves. \n\n‘Nonsense’ became the hinge of Wittgensteinian\ninterpretative discussion during the last decade of the 20th century.\nBeyond the bounds of language lies nonsense—propositions which\ncannot picture anything—and Wittgenstein bans\ntraditional metaphysics to that area. The quandary arises concerning\nthe question of what it is that inhabits that realm of nonsense, since\nWittgenstein does seem to be saying that there is something there to\nbe shown (rather than said) and does, indeed, characterize it as the\n‘mystical’. The traditional readings of the\nTractatus accepted, with varying degrees of discomfort, the\nexistence of that which is unsayable, that which cannot be put into\nwords, the nonsensical. More recent readings tend to take nonsense\nmore seriously as exactly that—nonsense. This also entails\ntaking seriously Wittgenstein’s words in 6.54—his famous ladder\nmetaphor—and throwing out the Tractatus itself,\nincluding the distinction between what can be said and what can only\nbe shown. The Tractatus, on this stance, does not point at\nineffable truths (of, e.g., metaphysics, ethics, aesthetics, etc.),\nbut should lead us away from such temptations.  An accompanying\ndiscussion must then also deal with how this can be recognized, what\nthis can possibly mean, and how it should be used, if at all. \n\nThis discussion is closely related to what has come to be called the\nethical reading of the Tractatus. Such a reading is based,\nfirst, on the supposed discrepancy between Wittgenstein’s construction\nof a world-language system, which takes up the bulk of the\nTractatus, and several comments that are made about this\nconstruction in the Preface to the book, in its closing remarks, and\nin a letter he sent to his publisher, Ludwig von Ficker, before\npublication. In these places, all of which can be viewed as external\nto the content of the Tractatus, Wittgenstein preaches\nsilence as regards anything that is of importance, including the\n‘internal’ parts of the book which contain, in his own\nwords, “the final solution of the problems [of\nphilosophy].” It is the importance given to the ineffable that\ncan be viewed as an ethical position. “My work consists of two\nparts, the one presented here plus all that I have not\nwritten. And it is precisely this second part that is the important\npoint. For the ethical gets its limit drawn from the inside, as it\nwere, by my book; … I’ve managed in my book to put everything\nfirmly into place by being silent about it …. For now I would\nrecommend you to read the preface and\nthe conclusion, because they contain the most direct\nexpression of the point” (ProtoTractatus,\np.16). Obviously, such seemingly contradictory tensions within and\nabout a text—written by its author—give rise to\ninterpretative conundrums. \n\nThere is another issue often debated by interpreters of Wittgenstein,\nwhich arises out of the questions above. This has to do with the\ncontinuity between the thought of the early and later\nWittgenstein. Again, the ‘standard’ interpretations were\noriginally united in perceiving a clear break between the two distinct\nstages of Wittgenstein’s thought, even when ascertaining some\ndevelopmental continuity between them. And again, the more recent\ninterpretations challenge this standard, emphasizing that the\nfundamental therapeutic motivation clearly found in the later\nWittgenstein should also be attributed to the early. \n\nThe idea that philosophy is not a doctrine, and hence should not be\napproached dogmatically, is one of the most important insights of the\nTractatus. Yet, as early as 1931, Wittgenstein referred to\nhis own early work as ‘dogmatic’ (“On\nDogmatism” in VC, p. 182). Wittgenstein used this term\nto designate any conception which allows for a gap between question\nand answer, such that the answer to the question could be found at a\nlater date. The complex edifice of the Tractatus is built on\nthe assumption that the task of logical analysis was to discover the\nelementary propositions, whose form was not yet known. What marks the\ntransition from early to later Wittgenstein can be summed up as the\ntotal rejection of dogmatism, i.e., as the working out of\nall the consequences of this rejection. The move from the\nrealm of logic to that of ordinary language as the center of the\nphilosopher’s attention; from an emphasis on definition and analysis\nto ‘family resemblance’ and ‘language-games’;\nand from systematic philosophical writing to an aphoristic\nstyle—all have to do with this transition towards anti-dogmatism\nin its extreme. It is in the Philosophical Investigations\nthat the working out of the transitions comes to culmination. Other\nwritings of the same period, though, manifest the same anti-dogmatic\nstance, as it is applied, e.g., to the philosophy of mathematics or to\nphilosophical psychology. \nPhilosophical Investigations was published posthumously in\n1953. It was edited by G. E. M. Anscombe and Rush Rhees and translated\nby Anscombe. It comprised two parts. Part I, consisting of 693\nnumbered paragraphs, was ready for printing in 1946, but rescinded\nfrom the publisher by Wittgenstein. Part II was added on by the\neditors, trustees of his Nachlass. In 2009 a new edited\ntranslation, by P. M. S. Hacker and Joachim Schulte, was published;\nPart II of the earlier translation was here labeled “Philosophy\nof Psychology – A Fragment” (PPF). \n\nIn the Preface to PI, Wittgenstein states that his new\nthoughts would be better understood by contrast with and against the\nbackground of his old thoughts, those in the Tractatus; and\nindeed, most of Part I of PI is essentially critical. Its new\ninsights can be understood as primarily exposing fallacies in the\ntraditional way of thinking about language, truth, thought,\nintentionality, and, perhaps mainly, philosophy. In this sense, it is\nconceived of as a therapeutic work, viewing philosophy itself\nas therapy. (Part II (PPF), focusing on philosophical psychology,\nperception etc., was not as critical. Rather, it pointed to new\nperspectives (which, undoubtedly, are not disconnected from the\nearlier critique) in addressing specific philosophical issues.  It is,\ntherefore, more easily read alongside Wittgenstein’s other writings of\nthe later period.) \n\nPI begins with a quote from Augustine’s Confessions\nwhich “give us a particular picture of the essence of human language,”\nbased on the idea that “the words in language name objects,”\nand that “sentences are combinations of such names” (PI\n1). This picture of language cannot be relied on as a basis for\nmetaphysical, epistemic or linguistic speculation. Despite its\nplausibility, this reduction of language to representation cannot do\njustice to the whole of human language; and even if it is to be\nconsidered a picture of only the representative function of human\nlanguage, it is, as such, a poor picture. Furthermore, this picture of\nlanguage is at the base of the whole of traditional philosophy, but,\nfor Wittgenstein, it is to be shunned in favor of a new way of looking\nat both language and philosophy. The Philosophical\nInvestigations proceeds to offer the new way of looking at\nlanguage, which will yield the view of philosophy as therapy. \n\n“For a large class of cases of the employment of the\nword ‘meaning’—though not for all—this word can\nbe explained in this way: the meaning of a word is its use in the\nlanguage” (PI 43). This basic statement is what\nunderlies the change of perspective most typical of the later phase of\nWittgenstein’s thought: a change from a conception of meaning as\nrepresentation to a view which looks to use as the crux of the\ninvestigation. Traditional theories of meaning in the history of\nphilosophy were intent on pointing to something exterior to the\nproposition which endows it with sense. This ‘something’\ncould generally be located either in an objective space, or inside the\nmind as mental representation. As early as 1933 (The Blue\nBook) Wittgenstein took pains to challenge these conceptions,\narriving at the insight that “if we had to name anything which\nis the life of the sign, we should have to say that it was its\nuse” (BB 4).  Ascertainment of the use (of a\nword, of a proposition), however, is not given to any sort of\nconstructive theory building, as in the Tractatus. Rather,\nwhen investigating meaning, the philosopher must “look and\nsee” the variety of uses to which the word is put. An analogy\nwith tools sheds light on the nature of words. When we think of tools\nin a toolbox, we do not fail to see their variety; but the\n“functions of words are as diverse as the functions of these\nobjects” (PI 11). We are misled by the uniform\nappearance of our words into theorizing upon meaning:\n“Especially when we are doing philosophy!” (PI\n12)  \n\nSo different is this new perspective that Wittgenstein repeats:\n“Don’t think, but look!” (PI 66); and such\nlooking is done vis a vis particular cases, not\ngeneralizations. In giving the meaning of a word, any explanatory\ngeneralization should be replaced by a description of use. The\ntraditional idea that a proposition houses a content and has a\nrestricted number of Fregean forces (such as assertion, question and\ncommand), gives way to an emphasis on the diversity of uses. In order\nto address the countless multiplicity of uses, their un-fixedness, and\ntheir being part of an activity, Wittgenstein introduces the key\nconcept of ‘language-game’. He never explicitly defines it\nsince, as opposed to the earlier ‘picture’, for instance,\nthis new concept is made to do work for a more fluid, more\ndiversified, and more activity-oriented perspective on language. \n\nThroughout the Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein\nreturns, again and again, to the concept of language-games to make\nclear his lines of thought concerning language. Primitive\nlanguage-games are scrutinized for the insights they afford on this or\nthat characteristic of language. Thus, the builders’ language-game\n(PI 2), in which a builder and his assistant use exactly four\nterms (block, pillar, slab, beam), is utilized to illustrate that part\nof the Augustinian picture of language which might be correct but\nwhich is, nevertheless, strictly limited. ‘Regular’\nlanguage-games, such as the astonishing list provided in PI\n23 (which includes, e.g., reporting an event, speculating about an\nevent, forming and testing a hypothesis, making up a story, reading\nit, play-acting, singing catches, guessing riddles, making a joke,\ntranslating, asking, thanking, and so on), bring out the openness of\nour possibilities in using language and in describing it. \n\nLanguage-games are, first, a part of a broader context termed by\nWittgenstein a form of life (see below). Secondly, the concept of\nlanguage-games points at the rule-governed character of language. This\ndoes not entail strict and definite systems of rules for each and\nevery language-game, but points to the conventional nature of this\nsort of human activity. Still, just as we cannot give a final,\nessential definition of ‘game’, so we cannot find\n“what is common to all these activities and what makes them into\nlanguage or parts of language” (PI 65). \n\nIt is here that Wittgenstein’s rejection of general explanations, and\ndefinitions based on sufficient and necessary conditions, is best\npronounced. Instead of these symptoms of the philosopher’s “craving\nfor generality”, he points to ‘family resemblance’ as the\nmore suitable analogy for the means of connecting particular uses of\nthe same word. There is no reason to look, as we have done\ntraditionally—and dogmatically—for one, essential core\nin which the meaning of a word is located and which is, therefore,\ncommon to all uses of that word. We should, instead, travel with the\nword’s uses through “a complicated network of similarities\noverlapping and criss-crossing” (PI 66). Family resemblance\nalso serves to exhibit the lack of boundaries and the distance from\nexactness that characterize different uses of the same concept. Such\nboundaries and exactness are the definitive traits of form—be\nit Platonic form, Aristotelian form, or the general form of a\nproposition adumbrated in the Tractatus.  It is from such\nforms that applications of concepts can be deduced, but this is\nprecisely what Wittgenstein now eschews in favor of appeal to\nsimilarity of a kind with family resemblance. \n\nOne of the issues most associated with the later Wittgenstein is that\nof rule-following. Rising out of the considerations above, it becomes\nanother central point of discussion in the question of what it is that\ncan apply to all the uses of a word. The same dogmatic stance as before\nhas it that a rule is an abstract entity—transcending all of its\nparticular applications; knowing the rule involves grasping that\nabstract entity and thereby knowing how to use it.  \n\nWittgenstein begins his exposition by introducing an example:\n“… we get [a] pupil to continue a series (say ‘+\n2’) beyond 1000—and he writes 1000, 1004, 1008, 1012\n(PI 185)”. What do we do, and what does it mean, when\nthe student, upon being corrected, answers “But I did go on in\nthe same way”? Wittgenstein proceeds (mainly in PI\n185–243, but also elsewhere) to dismantle the cluster of attendant\nquestions: How do we learn rules?  How do we follow them?  Wherefrom\nthe standards which decide if a rule is followed correctly?  Are they\nin the mind, along with a mental representation of the rule?  Do we\nappeal to intuition in their application? Are they socially and\npublicly taught and enforced? In typical Wittgensteinian fashion, the\nanswers are not pursued positively; rather, the very formulation of\nthe questions as legitimate questions with coherent content is put to\nthe test. For indeed, it is both the Platonistic and mentalistic\npictures which underlie asking questions of this type, and\nWittgenstein is intent on freeing us from these assumptions. Such\nliberation involves elimination of the need to posit any sort of\nexternal or internal authority beyond the actual applications of the\nrule. \n\nThese considerations lead to PI 201, often considered the\nclimax of the issue: “This was our paradox: no course of action\ncould be determined by a rule, because every course of action can be\nmade out to accord with the rule. The answer was: if everything can be\nmade out to accord with the rule, then it can also be made out to\nconflict with it. And so there would be neither accord nor conflict\nhere.” Wittgenstein’s formulation of the problem, now at the\npoint of being a “paradox”, has given rise to a wealth of\ninterpretation and debate since it is clear to all that this is the\ncrux of the general issue of meaning, and of understanding and using a\nlanguage. One of the influential readings of the problem of following\na rule (introduced by Fogelin 1976 and Kripke 1982) has been the\ninterpretation, according to which Wittgenstein is here voicing a\nskeptical paradox and offering a skeptical solution. That is to say,\nthere are no facts that determine what counts as following a rule, no\nreal grounds for saying that someone is indeed following a rule, and\nWittgenstein accepts this skeptical challenge (by suggesting other\nconditions that might warrant our asserting that someone is following\na rule). This reading has been challenged, in turn, by several\ninterpretations (such as Baker and Hacker 1984, McGinn1984, and Cavell\n1990), while others have provided additional, fresh perspectives\n(e.g., Diamond, “Rules: Looking in the Right Place” in\nPhillips and Winch 1989, and several in Miller and Wright 2002). \n\nDirectly following the rule-following sections in\nPI, and therefore easily thought to be the upshot of the\ndiscussion, are those sections called by interpreters “the\nprivate-language argument”. Whether it be a veritable argument\nor not (and Wittgenstein never labeled it as such), these sections\npoint out that for an utterance to be meaningful it must be possible\nin principle to subject it to public standards and criteria of\ncorrectness. For this reason, a private-language, in which\n“words … are to refer to what only the speaker can\nknow—to his immediate private sensations …”\n(PI 243), is not a genuine, meaningful, rule-governed\nlanguage. The signs in language can only function when there is a\npossibility of judging the correctness of their use, “so the use\nof [a] word stands in need of a justification which everybody\nunderstands” (PI 261). \n\nGrammar, usually taken to consist of the rules of correct syntactic\nand semantic usage, becomes, in Wittgenstein’s hands, the\nwider—and more elusive—network of rules which determine\nwhat linguistic move is allowed as making sense, and what isn’t. This\nnotion replaces the stricter and purer logic, which played such an\nessential role in the\nTractatus in providing a scaffolding for language and the\nworld. Indeed, “Essence is expressed in grammar\n… Grammar tells what kind of object anything is.  (Theology as\ngrammar)” (PI 371, 373). The “rules” of\ngrammar are not mere technical instructions from on-high for correct\nusage; rather, they express the norms for meaningful\nlanguage. Contrary to empirical statements, rules of grammar describe\nhow we use words in order to both justify and criticize our particular\nutterances. But as opposed to grammar-book rules, they are not\nidealized as an external system to be conformed to. Moreover, they are\nnot appealed to explicitly in any formulation, but are used in cases\nof philosophical perplexity to clarify where language misleads us into\nfalse illusions.  Thus, “I can know what someone else is\nthinking, not what I am thinking. It is correct to say ‘I know\nwhat you are thinking’, and wrong to say ‘I know what I am\nthinking.’ (A whole cloud of philosophy condensed into a drop of\ngrammar.)” (Philosophical Investigations 1953,\np.222). \n\nGrammar is not abstract, it is situated within the regular activity\nwith which language-games are interwoven: “… the word\n‘language-game’ is used here to emphasize the\nfact that the speaking of language is part of an activity, or\nof a form of life” (PI 23). What enables language to\nfunction and therefore must be accepted as “given” are\nprecisely forms of life. In Wittgenstein’s terms, “It is not\nonly agreement in definitions but also (odd as it may sound) in\njudgments that is required” (PI 242), and this is\n“agreement not in opinions, but rather in form of life”\n(PI 241). Used by Wittgenstein sparingly—five times in\nthe Investigations—this concept has given rise to\ninterpretative quandaries and subsequent contradictory readings. Forms\nof life can be understood as changing and contingent, dependent on\nculture, context, history, etc; this appeal to forms of life grounds a\nrelativistic reading of Wittgenstein. On the other hand, it is the\nform of life common to humankind, “shared human behavior”\nwhich is “the system of reference by means of which we interpret\nan unknown language” (PI 206). This might be seen as a\nuniversalistic turn, recognizing that the use of language is made\npossible by the human form of life. \n\nIn his later writings Wittgenstein holds, as he did in\nthe Tractatus, that philosophers do not—or should\nnot—supply a theory, neither do they provide\nexplanations. “Philosophy just puts everything before us, and\nneither explains nor deduces anything.—Since everything lies\nopen to view there is nothing to explain” (PI 126). The\nanti-theoretical stance is reminiscent of the early Wittgenstein, but\nthere are manifest differences. Although the Tractatus\nprecludes philosophical theories, it does construct a systematic\nedifice which results in the general form of the proposition, all the\nwhile relying on strict formal logic; the Investigations\npoints out the therapeutic non-dogmatic nature of philosophy, verily\ninstructing philosophers in the ways of therapy. “The work of\nthe philosopher consists in marshalling reminders for a particular\npurpose” (PI 127).  Working with reminders and series\nof examples, different problems are solved. Unlike\nthe Tractatus which advanced one philosophical method, in\nthe Investigations “there is not a single philosophical\nmethod, though there are indeed methods, different therapies, as it\nwere” (PI 133d). This is directly related to\nWittgenstein’s eschewal of the logical form or of any\na-priori generalization that can be discovered or made in\nphilosophy. Trying to advance such general theses is a temptation\nwhich lures philosophers; but the real task of philosophy is both to\nmake us aware of the temptation and to show us how to overcome\nit. Consequently “a philosophical problem has the form: ‘I\ndon’t know my way about.’” (PI 123), and hence\nthe aim of philosophy is “to show the fly the way out of the\nfly-bottle” (PI 309). \n\nThe style of the Investigations is strikingly different from\nthat of the Tractatus. Instead of strictly numbered sections\nwhich are organized hierarchically in programmatic order, the\nInvestigations fragmentarily voices aphorisms about\nlanguage-games, family resemblance, forms of life, “sometimes\njumping, in a sudden change, from one area to another”\n(PI Preface). This variation in style is of course essential\nand is “connected with the very nature of the\ninvestigation” (PI Preface). As a matter of fact,\nWittgenstein was acutely aware of the contrast between the two stages\nof his thought, suggesting publication of both texts together in order\nto make the contrast obvious and clear. \n\nStill, it is precisely via the subject of the nature of philosophy\nthat the fundamental continuity between these two stages, rather than\nthe discrepancy between them, is to be found. In both cases philosophy\nserves, first, as critique of language. It is through analyzing\nlanguage’s illusive power that the philosopher can expose the traps of\nmeaningless philosophical formulations. This means that what was\nformerly thought of as a philosophical problem may now dissolve “and\nthis simply means that the philosophical problems should\ncompletely disappear” (PI 133). Two implications of\nthis diagnosis, easily traced back in the Tractatus, are to\nbe recognized. One is the inherent dialogical character of philosophy,\nwhich is a responsive activity: difficulties and torments are\nencountered which are then to be dissipated by philosophical therapy.\nIn the Tractatus, this took the shape of advice: “The correct\nmethod in philosophy would really be the following: to say nothing\nexcept what can be said, i.e. propositions of natural science …\nand then whenever someone else wanted to say something metaphysical,\nto demonstrate to him that he had failed to give a meaning to certain\nsigns in his propositions” (TLP 6.53) The second, more far-\nreaching, “discovery” in the Investigations “is the one that\nenables me to break off philosophizing when I want to”\n(PI 133). This has been taken to revert back to the ladder\nmetaphor and the injunction to silence in the Tractatus. \n\nIt has been submitted that the writings of the period from 1946 until\nhis death (1951) constitute a distinctive phase of Wittgenstein’s\nthought. These writings include, in addition to the second part of the\nfirst edition of the Philosophical Investigations, texts\nedited and collected in volumes such as Remarks on\nColour, Remarks on the Philosophy of\nPsychology, Zettel, On Certainty, and parts\nof The Foundations of Mathematics. Besides dealing with\nmathematics and psychology, this is the stage at which Wittgenstein\nmost seriously pursued questions traditionally recognized as\nepistemological. On Certainty tackles skeptical doubts and\nfoundational solutions but is, in typical Wittgensteinian fashion, a\nwork of therapy which discounts presuppositions common to both. This\nis intimately related to another of On Certainty’s\nthemes—the primacy of the deed to the word, or, in\nWittgenstein’s PI terminology, of form of life to\ngrammar. The general tenor of all the writings of this last period can\nthence be viewed as, on the one hand, a move away from the critical\n(some would say destructive) positions of the\nInvestigations to a more positive perspective on the same\nproblems that had been facing him since his early writings; on the\nother hand, this move does not constitute a break from the later\nperiod but is more properly viewed as its continuation, in a new\nlight.","contact.mail":"anatbi@post.tau.ac.il","contact.domain":"post.tau.ac.il"},{"date.published":"2002-11-08","date.changed":"2018-05-02","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/","author1":"Anat Biletzki","author1.info":"http://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/philos/segel/Matar.html","entry":"wittgenstein","body.text":"\n\n\n\nConsidered by some to be the greatest philosopher of the 20th century,\nLudwig Wittgenstein played a central, if controversial, role in\n20th-century analytic philosophy. He continues to influence current\nphilosophical thought in topics as diverse as logic and language,\nperception and intention, ethics and religion, aesthetics and culture.\nOriginally, there were two commonly recognized stages of\nWittgenstein’s thought—the early and the later—both\nof which were taken to be pivotal in their respective periods. In more\nrecent scholarship, this division has been questioned: some\ninterpreters have claimed a unity between all stages of his thought,\nwhile others talk of a more nuanced division, adding stages such as\nthe middle Wittgenstein and the third Wittgenstein. Still, it is\ncommonly acknowledged that the early Wittgenstein is epitomized in his\nTractatus Logico-Philosophicus. By showing the application of\nmodern logic to metaphysics, via language, he provided new insights\ninto the relations between world, thought and language and thereby into\nthe nature of philosophy. It is the later Wittgenstein, mostly\nrecognized in the Philosophical Investigations, who took the\nmore revolutionary step in critiquing all of traditional philosophy\nincluding its climax in his own early work. The nature of his new\nphilosophy is heralded as anti-systematic through and through, yet\nstill conducive to genuine philosophical understanding of traditional\nproblems.\n\n\nWittgenstein was born on April 26, 1889 in Vienna, Austria, to a\nwealthy industrial family, well-situated in intellectual and cultural\nViennese circles. In 1908 he began his studies in aeronautical\nengineering at Manchester University where his interest in the\nphilosophy of pure mathematics led him to Frege. Upon Frege’s\nadvice, in 1911 he went to Cambridge to study with Bertrand\nRussell. Russell wrote, upon meeting Wittgenstein: “An unknown\nGerman appeared … obstinate and perverse, but I think not\nstupid” (quoted by Monk 1990: 38f). Within one year, Russell was\ncommitted: “I shall certainly encourage him. Perhaps he will do\ngreat things … I love him and feel he will solve the problems I\nam too old to solve” (quoted by Monk 1990: 41). Russell’s\ninsight was accurate. Wittgenstein was idiosyncratic in his habits and\nway of life, yet profoundly acute in his philosophical\nsensitivity. \n\nDuring his years in Cambridge, from 1911 to 1913, Wittgenstein\nconducted several conversations on philosophy and the foundations of\nlogic with Russell, with whom he had an emotional and intense\nrelationship, as well as with Moore and Keynes. He retreated to\nisolation in Norway, for months at a time, in order to ponder these\nphilosophical problems and to work out their solutions. In 1913 he\nreturned to Austria and in 1914, at the start of World War I\n(1914–1918), joined the Austrian army. He was taken captive in 1918\nand spent the remaining months of the war at a prison camp. It was\nduring the war that he wrote the notes and drafts of his first\nimportant work, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. After the war\nthe book was published in German and translated into English. \n\nIn 1920 Wittgenstein, now divorced from philosophy (having, to his\nmind, solved all philosophical problems in the Tractatus),\ngave away his part of his family’s fortune and pursued several\n‘professions’ (gardener, teacher, architect, etc.) in and\naround Vienna. It was only in 1929 that he returned to Cambridge to\nresume his philosophical vocation, after having been exposed to\ndiscussions on the philosophy of mathematics and science with members\nof the Vienna Circle, whose conception of logical empiricism was\nindebted to his Tractatus account of logic as tautologous,\nand his philosophy as concerned with logical syntax. During these\nfirst years in Cambridge his conception of philosophy and its problems\nunderwent dramatic changes that are recorded in several volumes of\nconversations, lecture notes, and letters (e.g., Ludwig\nWittgenstein and the Vienna Circle, The Blue and Brown\nBooks, Philosophical Grammar).  Sometimes termed the\n‘middle Wittgenstein’, this period heralds a rejection of\ndogmatic philosophy, including both traditional works and the\nTractatus itself. \n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s Wittgenstein conducted seminars at\nCambridge, developing most of the ideas that he intended to publish in\nhis second book, Philosophical Investigations. These included\nthe turn from formal logic to ordinary language, novel reflections on\npsychology and mathematics, and a general skepticism concerning\nphilosophy’s pretensions. In 1945 he prepared the final manuscript of\nthe Philosophical Investigations, but, at the last minute,\nwithdrew it from publication (and only authorized its posthumous\npublication). For a few more years he continued his philosophical work,\nbut this is marked by a rich development of, rather than a turn away\nfrom, his second phase. He traveled during this period to the United\nStates and Ireland, and returned to Cambridge, where he was diagnosed\nwith cancer. Legend has it that, at his death in 1951, his last words\nwere “Tell them I’ve had a wonderful life” (Monk: 579). \nTractatus Logico-Philosophicus was first published in German\nin 1921 and then translated—by C.K. Ogden, with\nF. P. Ramsey’s help—and published in English in 1922. It\nwas later re-translated by D.  F. Pears and B. F. McGuinness. Coming\nout of Wittgenstein’s Notes on Logic (1913),\n“Notes Dictated to G. E. Moore” (1914),\nhis Notebooks, written in 1914–16, and further correspondence\nwith Russell, Moore and Keynes, and showing Schopenhauerian and other\ncultural influences, it evolved as a continuation of and reaction to\nRussell and Frege’s conceptions of logic and language. Russell\nsupplied an introduction to the book claiming that it “certainly\ndeserves … to be considered an important event in the\nphilosophical world.” It is fascinating to note that\nWittgenstein thought little of Russell’s introduction, claiming\nthat it was riddled with misunderstandings. Later interpretations have\nattempted to unearth the surprising tensions between the introduction\nand the rest of the book (or between Russell’s reading of\nWittgenstein and Wittgenstein’s own\nself-assessment)—usually harping on Russell’s\nappropriation of Wittgenstein for his own agenda.  \n\nThe Tractatus’s structure purports to be representative of\nits internal essence. It is constructed around seven basic\npropositions, numbered by the natural numbers 1–7, with all other\nparagraphs in the text numbered by decimal expansions so that, e.g.,\nparagraph 1.1 is (supposed to be) a further elaboration on proposition\n1, 1.22 is an elaboration of 1.2, and so on. \n\nThe seven basic propositions are: \n\nClearly, the book addresses the central problems of philosophy which\ndeal with the world, thought and language, and presents a ‘solution’\n(as Wittgenstein terms it) of these problems that is grounded in logic\nand in the nature of representation. The world is represented by\nthought, which is a proposition with sense, since they all—world,\nthought, and proposition—share the same logical form. Hence, the\nthought and the proposition can be pictures of the facts. \n\nStarting with a seeming metaphysics, Wittgenstein sees the world as\nconsisting of facts (1), rather than the traditional, atomistic\nconception of a world made up of objects. Facts are existent states of\naffairs (2) and states of affairs, in turn, are combinations of\nobjects. “Objects are simple” (TLP\n2.02) but objects can fit together in various determinate ways. They\nmay have various properties and may hold diverse relations to one\nanother.  Objects combine with one another according to their logical,\ninternal properties. That is to say, an object’s internal properties\ndetermine the possibilities of its combination with other objects;\nthis is its logical form. Thus, states of affairs, being comprised of\nobjects in combination, are inherently complex. The states of affairs\nwhich do exist could have been otherwise. This means that states of\naffairs are either actual (existent) or possible. It is the totality\nof states of affairs—actual and possible—that makes up\nthe whole of reality.  The world is precisely those states of affairs\nwhich do exist. \n\nThe move to thought, and thereafter to language, is perpetrated with\nthe use of Wittgenstein’s famous idea that thoughts, and propositions,\nare pictures—“the picture is a model of reality” (TLP\n2.12). Pictures are made up of elements that together constitute the\npicture. Each element represents an object, and the combination of\nelements in the picture represents the combination of objects in a\nstate of affairs. The logical structure of the picture, whether in\nthought or in language, is isomorphic with the logical structure of\nthe state of affairs which it pictures. More subtle is Wittgenstein’s\ninsight that the possibility of this structure being shared by the\npicture (the thought, the proposition) and the state of affairs is the\npictorial form. “That is how a picture is attached to\nreality; it reaches right out to it” (TLP 2.1511). This leads\nto an understanding of what the picture can picture; but also what it\ncannot—its own pictorial form. \n\nWhile “the logical picture of the facts is the thought” (3), in the\nmove to language Wittgenstein continues to investigate the\npossibilities of significance for propositions (4). Logical analysis,\nin the spirit of Frege and Russell, guides the work, with Wittgenstein\nusing logical calculus to carry out the construction of his system.\nExplaining that “Only the proposition has sense; only in the context of\na proposition has a name meaning” (TLP 3.3), he provides the\nreader with the two conditions for sensical language. First, the\nstructure of the proposition must conform to the constraints of\nlogical form, and second, the elements of the proposition must have\nreference (bedeutung). These conditions have far-reaching\nimplications. The analysis must culminate with a name being a primitive\nsymbol for a (simple) object. Moreover, logic itself gives us the\nstructure and limits of what can be said at all. \n\n“The general form of a proposition is: This is how things\nstand” (TLP 4.5) and every proposition is either true\nor false. This bi-polarity of propositions enables the composition of\nmore complex propositions from atomic ones by using truth-functional\noperators (5). Wittgenstein supplies, in the Tractatus, a\nvivid presentation of Frege’s logic in the form of what has become\nknown as ‘truth-tables’. This provides the means to go\nback and analyze all propositions into their atomic parts, since\n“every statement about complexes can be analyzed into a\nstatement about their constituent parts, and into those propositions\nwhich completely describe the complexes” (TLP\n2.0201). He delves even deeper by then providing the general form of a\ntruth-function (6). This form, \\([\\bar{p}, \\bar{\\xi}, N(\\bar{\\xi})]\\),\nmakes use of one formal operation \\((N(\\bar{\\xi}))\\)\nand one propositional variable \\((\\bar{p})\\)\nto represent Wittgenstein’s claim that any proposition “is the result\nof successive applications” of logical operations to elementary\npropositions. \n\nHaving developed this analysis of world-thought-language, and\nrelying on the one general form of the proposition, Wittgenstein can\nnow assert that all meaningful propositions are of equal value.\nSubsequently, he ends the journey with the admonition concerning what\ncan (or cannot) and what should (or should not) be said (7), leaving\noutside the realm of the sayable propositions of ethics, aesthetics,\nand metaphysics. \n\nIn the Tractatus Wittgenstein’s logical construction of a\nphilosophical system has a purpose—to find the limits of\nworld, thought and language; in other words, to distinguish between\nsense and nonsense. “The book will … draw a limit to thinking,\nor rather—not to thinking, but to the expression of thoughts\n…. The limit can … only be drawn in language and what\nlies on the other side of the limit will be simply nonsense”\n(TLP Preface). The conditions for a proposition’s having\nsense have been explored and seen to rest on the possibility of\nrepresentation or picturing. Names must have a bedeutung\n(reference/meaning), but they can only do so in the context of a\nproposition which is held together by logical form. It follows that\nonly factual states of affairs which can be pictured can be\nrepresented by meaningful propositions. This means that what can be\nsaid are only propositions of natural science and leaves out of the\nrealm of sense a daunting number of statements which are made and used\nin language. \n\nThere are, first, the propositions of logic itself. These do not\nrepresent states of affairs, and the logical constants do not stand\nfor objects.  “My fundamental thought is that the logical\nconstants do not represent.  That the logic of the facts\ncannot be represented” (TLP 4.0312). This is not a\nhappenstance thought; it is fundamental precisely because the limits\nof sense rest on logic.  Tautologies and contradictions, the\npropositions of logic, are the limits of language and thought, and\nthereby the limits of the world.  Obviously, then, they do not picture\nanything and do not, therefore, have sense. They are, in\nWittgenstein’s terms, senseless (sinnlos). Propositions which\ndo have sense are bipolar; they range within the truth-conditions\ndrawn by the truth-tables.  But the propositions of logic themselves\nare “not pictures of the reality … for the one\nallows every possible state of affairs, the\nother none” (TLP 4.462). Indeed, tautologies\n(and contradictions), being senseless, are recognized as true (or\nfalse) “in the symbol alone … and this fact contains in\nitself the whole philosophy of logic” (TLP 6.113). \n\nThe characteristic of being senseless applies not only to the\npropositions of logic but also to mathematics or the pictorial form itself of the\npictures that do represent. These are, like tautologies and\ncontradictions, literally sense-less, they have no sense. \n\nBeyond, or aside from, senseless propositions Wittgenstein identifies\nanother group of statements which cannot carry sense: the nonsensical\n(unsinnig) propositions. Nonsense, as opposed to\nsenselessness, is encountered when a proposition is even more\nradically devoid of meaning, when it transcends the bounds of\nsense. Under the label of unsinnig can be found various\npropositions: “Socrates is identical”, but also “1\nis a number” and “there are objects”. While some\nnonsensical propositions are blatantly so, others seem to be\nmeaningful—and only analysis carried out in accordance with the\npicture theory can expose their nonsensicality. Since only what is\n“in” the world can be described, anything that is\n“higher” is excluded, including the notion of limit and\nthe limit points themselves. Traditional metaphysics, and the\npropositions of ethics and aesthetics, which try to capture the world\nas a whole, are also excluded, as is the truth in solipsism, the very\nnotion of a subject, for it is also not “in” the world but\nat its limit. \n\nWittgenstein does not, however, relegate all that is not inside the\nbounds of sense to oblivion. He makes a distinction between\nsaying and showing which is made to do additional\ncrucial work. “What can be shown cannot be said,” that is,\nwhat cannot be formulated in sayable (sensical) propositions can only\nbe shown. This applies, for example, to the logical form of the world,\nthe pictorial form, etc., which show themselves in the form of\n(contingent) propositions, in the symbolism, and in logical\npropositions. Even the unsayable (metaphysical, ethical, aesthetic)\npropositions of philosophy belong in this group—which\nWittgenstein finally describes as “things that cannot be put\ninto words. They make themselves manifest. They are what is\nmystical” (TLP 6.522). \n\nAccordingly, “the word ‘philosophy’ must mean something\nwhich stands above or below, but not beside the natural sciences”\n(TLP 4.111). Not surprisingly, then, “most of the\npropositions and questions to be found in philosophical works are not\nfalse but nonsensical” (TLP 4.003). Is, then, philosophy\ndoomed to be nonsense (unsinnig), or, at best, senseless\n(sinnlos) when it does logic, but, in any case, meaningless?\nWhat is left for the philosopher to do, if traditional, or even\nrevolutionary, propositions of metaphysics, epistemology, aesthetics,\nand ethics cannot be formulated in a sensical manner? The reply to\nthese two questions is found in Wittgenstein’s characterization of\nphilosophy: philosophy is not a theory, or a doctrine, but rather an\nactivity. It is an activity of clarification (of thoughts), and more\nso, of critique (of language).  Described by Wittgenstein, it should\nbe the philosopher’s routine activity: to react or respond to the\ntraditional philosophers’ musings by showing them where they go wrong,\nusing the tools provided by logical analysis. In other words, by\nshowing them that (some of) their propositions are nonsense. \n\n“All propositions are of equal value” (TLP 6.4)—that\ncould also be the fundamental thought of the book. For it employs a\nmeasure of the value of propositions that is done by logic and the\nnotion of limits. It is here, however, with the constraints on the\nvalue of propositions, that the tension in the Tractatus is\nmost strongly felt. It becomes clear that the notions used by the\nTractatus—the logical-philosophical notions—do\nnot belong to the world and hence cannot be used to express anything\nmeaningful. Since language, thought and the world, are all isomorphic,\nany attempt to say in logic (i.e., in language) “this and this there\nis in the world, that there is not” is doomed to be a failure, since\nit would mean that logic has got outside the limits of the world,\ni.e. of itself. That is to say, the Tractatus has gone over\nits own limits, and stands in danger of being nonsensical. \n\nThe “solution” to this tension is found in Wittgenstein’s final\nremarks, where he uses the metaphor of the ladder to express the\nfunction of the Tractatus. It is to be used in order to climb\non it, in order to “see the world rightly”; but thereafter it must be\nrecognized as nonsense and be thrown away. Hence: “whereof one cannot\nspeak, thereof one must be silent” (7). \n\nThe Tractatus is notorious for its interpretative\ndifficulties. In the decades that have passed since its\npublication it has gone through several waves of general\ninterpretations. Beyond exegetical and hermeneutical issues that\nrevolve around particular sections (such as the world/reality\ndistinction, the difference between representing and presenting, the\nFrege/Russell connection to Wittgenstein, or the influence on\nWittgenstein by existentialist philosophy) there are a few\nfundamental, not unrelated, disagreements that inform the map of\ninterpretation.  These revolve around the realism of the\nTractatus, the notion of nonsense and its role in reading the\nTractatus itself, and the reading of the Tractatus\nas an ethical tract. \n\nThere are interpretations that see the Tractatus as espousing\nrealism, i.e., as positing the independent existence of objects,\nstates of affairs, and facts. That this realism is achieved via a\nlinguistic turn is recognized by all (or most) interpreters, but this\nlinguistic perspective does no damage to the basic realism that is\nseen to start off the Tractatus (“The world is all that is\nthe case”) and to run throughout the text (“Objects form the substance\nof the world” (TLP 2.021)). Such realism is also taken to be\nmanifested in the essential bi-polarity of propositions; likewise, a\nstraightforward reading of the picturing relation posits objects there\nto be represented by signs. As against these readings, more\nlinguistically oriented interpretations give conceptual priority to\nthe symbolism. When “reality is compared with propositions”\n(TLP 4.05), it is the form of propositions which determines\nthe shape of reality (and not the other way round). In any case, the\nissue of realism (vs. anti-realism) in the Tractatus must\naddress the question of the limits of language and the more particular\nquestion of what there is (or is not) beyond language. Subsequently,\ninterpreters of the Tractatus have moved on to questioning\nthe very presence of metaphysics within the book and the status of the\npropositions of the book themselves. \n\n‘Nonsense’ became the hinge of Wittgensteinian\ninterpretative discussion during the last decade of the 20th century.\nBeyond the bounds of language lies nonsense—propositions which\ncannot picture anything—and Wittgenstein bans\ntraditional metaphysics to that area. The quandary arises concerning\nthe question of what it is that inhabits that realm of nonsense, since\nWittgenstein does seem to be saying that there is something there to\nbe shown (rather than said) and does, indeed, characterize it as the\n‘mystical’. The traditional readings of the\nTractatus accepted, with varying degrees of discomfort, the\nexistence of that which is unsayable, that which cannot be put into\nwords, the nonsensical. More recent readings tend to take nonsense\nmore seriously as exactly that—nonsense. This also entails\ntaking seriously Wittgenstein’s words in 6.54—his famous ladder\nmetaphor—and throwing out the Tractatus itself,\nincluding the distinction between what can be said and what can only\nbe shown. The Tractatus, on this stance, does not point at\nineffable truths (of, e.g., metaphysics, ethics, aesthetics, etc.),\nbut should lead us away from such temptations.  An accompanying\ndiscussion must then also deal with how this can be recognized, what\nthis can possibly mean, and how it should be used, if at all. \n\nThis discussion is closely related to what has come to be called the\nethical reading of the Tractatus. Such a reading is based,\nfirst, on the supposed discrepancy between Wittgenstein’s construction\nof a world-language system, which takes up the bulk of the\nTractatus, and several comments that are made about this\nconstruction in the Preface to the book, in its closing remarks, and\nin a letter he sent to his publisher, Ludwig von Ficker, before\npublication. In these places, all of which can be viewed as external\nto the content of the Tractatus, Wittgenstein preaches\nsilence as regards anything that is of importance, including the\n‘internal’ parts of the book which contain, in his own\nwords, “the final solution of the problems [of\nphilosophy].” It is the importance given to the ineffable that\ncan be viewed as an ethical position. “My work consists of two\nparts, the one presented here plus all that I have not\nwritten. And it is precisely this second part that is the important\npoint. For the ethical gets its limit drawn from the inside, as it\nwere, by my book; … I’ve managed in my book to put everything\nfirmly into place by being silent about it …. For now I would\nrecommend you to read the preface and\nthe conclusion, because they contain the most direct\nexpression of the point” (ProtoTractatus,\np.16). Obviously, such seemingly contradictory tensions within and\nabout a text—written by its author—give rise to\ninterpretative conundrums. \n\nThere is another issue often debated by interpreters of Wittgenstein,\nwhich arises out of the questions above. This has to do with the\ncontinuity between the thought of the early and later\nWittgenstein. Again, the ‘standard’ interpretations were\noriginally united in perceiving a clear break between the two distinct\nstages of Wittgenstein’s thought, even when ascertaining some\ndevelopmental continuity between them. And again, the more recent\ninterpretations challenge this standard, emphasizing that the\nfundamental therapeutic motivation clearly found in the later\nWittgenstein should also be attributed to the early. \n\nThe idea that philosophy is not a doctrine, and hence should not be\napproached dogmatically, is one of the most important insights of the\nTractatus. Yet, as early as 1931, Wittgenstein referred to\nhis own early work as ‘dogmatic’ (“On\nDogmatism” in VC, p. 182). Wittgenstein used this term\nto designate any conception which allows for a gap between question\nand answer, such that the answer to the question could be found at a\nlater date. The complex edifice of the Tractatus is built on\nthe assumption that the task of logical analysis was to discover the\nelementary propositions, whose form was not yet known. What marks the\ntransition from early to later Wittgenstein can be summed up as the\ntotal rejection of dogmatism, i.e., as the working out of\nall the consequences of this rejection. The move from the\nrealm of logic to that of ordinary language as the center of the\nphilosopher’s attention; from an emphasis on definition and analysis\nto ‘family resemblance’ and ‘language-games’;\nand from systematic philosophical writing to an aphoristic\nstyle—all have to do with this transition towards anti-dogmatism\nin its extreme. It is in the Philosophical Investigations\nthat the working out of the transitions comes to culmination. Other\nwritings of the same period, though, manifest the same anti-dogmatic\nstance, as it is applied, e.g., to the philosophy of mathematics or to\nphilosophical psychology. \nPhilosophical Investigations was published posthumously in\n1953. It was edited by G. E. M. Anscombe and Rush Rhees and translated\nby Anscombe. It comprised two parts. Part I, consisting of 693\nnumbered paragraphs, was ready for printing in 1946, but rescinded\nfrom the publisher by Wittgenstein. Part II was added on by the\neditors, trustees of his Nachlass. In 2009 a new edited\ntranslation, by P. M. S. Hacker and Joachim Schulte, was published;\nPart II of the earlier translation was here labeled “Philosophy\nof Psychology – A Fragment” (PPF). \n\nIn the Preface to PI, Wittgenstein states that his new\nthoughts would be better understood by contrast with and against the\nbackground of his old thoughts, those in the Tractatus; and\nindeed, most of Part I of PI is essentially critical. Its new\ninsights can be understood as primarily exposing fallacies in the\ntraditional way of thinking about language, truth, thought,\nintentionality, and, perhaps mainly, philosophy. In this sense, it is\nconceived of as a therapeutic work, viewing philosophy itself\nas therapy. (Part II (PPF), focusing on philosophical psychology,\nperception etc., was not as critical. Rather, it pointed to new\nperspectives (which, undoubtedly, are not disconnected from the\nearlier critique) in addressing specific philosophical issues.  It is,\ntherefore, more easily read alongside Wittgenstein’s other writings of\nthe later period.) \n\nPI begins with a quote from Augustine’s Confessions\nwhich “give us a particular picture of the essence of human language,”\nbased on the idea that “the words in language name objects,”\nand that “sentences are combinations of such names” (PI\n1). This picture of language cannot be relied on as a basis for\nmetaphysical, epistemic or linguistic speculation. Despite its\nplausibility, this reduction of language to representation cannot do\njustice to the whole of human language; and even if it is to be\nconsidered a picture of only the representative function of human\nlanguage, it is, as such, a poor picture. Furthermore, this picture of\nlanguage is at the base of the whole of traditional philosophy, but,\nfor Wittgenstein, it is to be shunned in favor of a new way of looking\nat both language and philosophy. The Philosophical\nInvestigations proceeds to offer the new way of looking at\nlanguage, which will yield the view of philosophy as therapy. \n\n“For a large class of cases of the employment of the\nword ‘meaning’—though not for all—this word can\nbe explained in this way: the meaning of a word is its use in the\nlanguage” (PI 43). This basic statement is what\nunderlies the change of perspective most typical of the later phase of\nWittgenstein’s thought: a change from a conception of meaning as\nrepresentation to a view which looks to use as the crux of the\ninvestigation. Traditional theories of meaning in the history of\nphilosophy were intent on pointing to something exterior to the\nproposition which endows it with sense. This ‘something’\ncould generally be located either in an objective space, or inside the\nmind as mental representation. As early as 1933 (The Blue\nBook) Wittgenstein took pains to challenge these conceptions,\narriving at the insight that “if we had to name anything which\nis the life of the sign, we should have to say that it was its\nuse” (BB 4).  Ascertainment of the use (of a\nword, of a proposition), however, is not given to any sort of\nconstructive theory building, as in the Tractatus. Rather,\nwhen investigating meaning, the philosopher must “look and\nsee” the variety of uses to which the word is put. An analogy\nwith tools sheds light on the nature of words. When we think of tools\nin a toolbox, we do not fail to see their variety; but the\n“functions of words are as diverse as the functions of these\nobjects” (PI 11). We are misled by the uniform\nappearance of our words into theorizing upon meaning:\n“Especially when we are doing philosophy!” (PI\n12)  \n\nSo different is this new perspective that Wittgenstein repeats:\n“Don’t think, but look!” (PI 66); and such\nlooking is done vis a vis particular cases, not\ngeneralizations. In giving the meaning of a word, any explanatory\ngeneralization should be replaced by a description of use. The\ntraditional idea that a proposition houses a content and has a\nrestricted number of Fregean forces (such as assertion, question and\ncommand), gives way to an emphasis on the diversity of uses. In order\nto address the countless multiplicity of uses, their un-fixedness, and\ntheir being part of an activity, Wittgenstein introduces the key\nconcept of ‘language-game’. He never explicitly defines it\nsince, as opposed to the earlier ‘picture’, for instance,\nthis new concept is made to do work for a more fluid, more\ndiversified, and more activity-oriented perspective on language. \n\nThroughout the Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein\nreturns, again and again, to the concept of language-games to make\nclear his lines of thought concerning language. Primitive\nlanguage-games are scrutinized for the insights they afford on this or\nthat characteristic of language. Thus, the builders’ language-game\n(PI 2), in which a builder and his assistant use exactly four\nterms (block, pillar, slab, beam), is utilized to illustrate that part\nof the Augustinian picture of language which might be correct but\nwhich is, nevertheless, strictly limited. ‘Regular’\nlanguage-games, such as the astonishing list provided in PI\n23 (which includes, e.g., reporting an event, speculating about an\nevent, forming and testing a hypothesis, making up a story, reading\nit, play-acting, singing catches, guessing riddles, making a joke,\ntranslating, asking, thanking, and so on), bring out the openness of\nour possibilities in using language and in describing it. \n\nLanguage-games are, first, a part of a broader context termed by\nWittgenstein a form of life (see below). Secondly, the concept of\nlanguage-games points at the rule-governed character of language. This\ndoes not entail strict and definite systems of rules for each and\nevery language-game, but points to the conventional nature of this\nsort of human activity. Still, just as we cannot give a final,\nessential definition of ‘game’, so we cannot find\n“what is common to all these activities and what makes them into\nlanguage or parts of language” (PI 65). \n\nIt is here that Wittgenstein’s rejection of general explanations, and\ndefinitions based on sufficient and necessary conditions, is best\npronounced. Instead of these symptoms of the philosopher’s “craving\nfor generality”, he points to ‘family resemblance’ as the\nmore suitable analogy for the means of connecting particular uses of\nthe same word. There is no reason to look, as we have done\ntraditionally—and dogmatically—for one, essential core\nin which the meaning of a word is located and which is, therefore,\ncommon to all uses of that word. We should, instead, travel with the\nword’s uses through “a complicated network of similarities\noverlapping and criss-crossing” (PI 66). Family resemblance\nalso serves to exhibit the lack of boundaries and the distance from\nexactness that characterize different uses of the same concept. Such\nboundaries and exactness are the definitive traits of form—be\nit Platonic form, Aristotelian form, or the general form of a\nproposition adumbrated in the Tractatus.  It is from such\nforms that applications of concepts can be deduced, but this is\nprecisely what Wittgenstein now eschews in favor of appeal to\nsimilarity of a kind with family resemblance. \n\nOne of the issues most associated with the later Wittgenstein is that\nof rule-following. Rising out of the considerations above, it becomes\nanother central point of discussion in the question of what it is that\ncan apply to all the uses of a word. The same dogmatic stance as before\nhas it that a rule is an abstract entity—transcending all of its\nparticular applications; knowing the rule involves grasping that\nabstract entity and thereby knowing how to use it.  \n\nWittgenstein begins his exposition by introducing an example:\n“… we get [a] pupil to continue a series (say ‘+\n2’) beyond 1000—and he writes 1000, 1004, 1008, 1012\n(PI 185)”. What do we do, and what does it mean, when\nthe student, upon being corrected, answers “But I did go on in\nthe same way”? Wittgenstein proceeds (mainly in PI\n185–243, but also elsewhere) to dismantle the cluster of attendant\nquestions: How do we learn rules?  How do we follow them?  Wherefrom\nthe standards which decide if a rule is followed correctly?  Are they\nin the mind, along with a mental representation of the rule?  Do we\nappeal to intuition in their application? Are they socially and\npublicly taught and enforced? In typical Wittgensteinian fashion, the\nanswers are not pursued positively; rather, the very formulation of\nthe questions as legitimate questions with coherent content is put to\nthe test. For indeed, it is both the Platonistic and mentalistic\npictures which underlie asking questions of this type, and\nWittgenstein is intent on freeing us from these assumptions. Such\nliberation involves elimination of the need to posit any sort of\nexternal or internal authority beyond the actual applications of the\nrule. \n\nThese considerations lead to PI 201, often considered the\nclimax of the issue: “This was our paradox: no course of action\ncould be determined by a rule, because every course of action can be\nmade out to accord with the rule. The answer was: if everything can be\nmade out to accord with the rule, then it can also be made out to\nconflict with it. And so there would be neither accord nor conflict\nhere.” Wittgenstein’s formulation of the problem, now at the\npoint of being a “paradox”, has given rise to a wealth of\ninterpretation and debate since it is clear to all that this is the\ncrux of the general issue of meaning, and of understanding and using a\nlanguage. One of the influential readings of the problem of following\na rule (introduced by Fogelin 1976 and Kripke 1982) has been the\ninterpretation, according to which Wittgenstein is here voicing a\nskeptical paradox and offering a skeptical solution. That is to say,\nthere are no facts that determine what counts as following a rule, no\nreal grounds for saying that someone is indeed following a rule, and\nWittgenstein accepts this skeptical challenge (by suggesting other\nconditions that might warrant our asserting that someone is following\na rule). This reading has been challenged, in turn, by several\ninterpretations (such as Baker and Hacker 1984, McGinn1984, and Cavell\n1990), while others have provided additional, fresh perspectives\n(e.g., Diamond, “Rules: Looking in the Right Place” in\nPhillips and Winch 1989, and several in Miller and Wright 2002). \n\nDirectly following the rule-following sections in\nPI, and therefore easily thought to be the upshot of the\ndiscussion, are those sections called by interpreters “the\nprivate-language argument”. Whether it be a veritable argument\nor not (and Wittgenstein never labeled it as such), these sections\npoint out that for an utterance to be meaningful it must be possible\nin principle to subject it to public standards and criteria of\ncorrectness. For this reason, a private-language, in which\n“words … are to refer to what only the speaker can\nknow—to his immediate private sensations …”\n(PI 243), is not a genuine, meaningful, rule-governed\nlanguage. The signs in language can only function when there is a\npossibility of judging the correctness of their use, “so the use\nof [a] word stands in need of a justification which everybody\nunderstands” (PI 261). \n\nGrammar, usually taken to consist of the rules of correct syntactic\nand semantic usage, becomes, in Wittgenstein’s hands, the\nwider—and more elusive—network of rules which determine\nwhat linguistic move is allowed as making sense, and what isn’t. This\nnotion replaces the stricter and purer logic, which played such an\nessential role in the\nTractatus in providing a scaffolding for language and the\nworld. Indeed, “Essence is expressed in grammar\n… Grammar tells what kind of object anything is.  (Theology as\ngrammar)” (PI 371, 373). The “rules” of\ngrammar are not mere technical instructions from on-high for correct\nusage; rather, they express the norms for meaningful\nlanguage. Contrary to empirical statements, rules of grammar describe\nhow we use words in order to both justify and criticize our particular\nutterances. But as opposed to grammar-book rules, they are not\nidealized as an external system to be conformed to. Moreover, they are\nnot appealed to explicitly in any formulation, but are used in cases\nof philosophical perplexity to clarify where language misleads us into\nfalse illusions.  Thus, “I can know what someone else is\nthinking, not what I am thinking. It is correct to say ‘I know\nwhat you are thinking’, and wrong to say ‘I know what I am\nthinking.’ (A whole cloud of philosophy condensed into a drop of\ngrammar.)” (Philosophical Investigations 1953,\np.222). \n\nGrammar is not abstract, it is situated within the regular activity\nwith which language-games are interwoven: “… the word\n‘language-game’ is used here to emphasize the\nfact that the speaking of language is part of an activity, or\nof a form of life” (PI 23). What enables language to\nfunction and therefore must be accepted as “given” are\nprecisely forms of life. In Wittgenstein’s terms, “It is not\nonly agreement in definitions but also (odd as it may sound) in\njudgments that is required” (PI 242), and this is\n“agreement not in opinions, but rather in form of life”\n(PI 241). Used by Wittgenstein sparingly—five times in\nthe Investigations—this concept has given rise to\ninterpretative quandaries and subsequent contradictory readings. Forms\nof life can be understood as changing and contingent, dependent on\nculture, context, history, etc; this appeal to forms of life grounds a\nrelativistic reading of Wittgenstein. On the other hand, it is the\nform of life common to humankind, “shared human behavior”\nwhich is “the system of reference by means of which we interpret\nan unknown language” (PI 206). This might be seen as a\nuniversalistic turn, recognizing that the use of language is made\npossible by the human form of life. \n\nIn his later writings Wittgenstein holds, as he did in\nthe Tractatus, that philosophers do not—or should\nnot—supply a theory, neither do they provide\nexplanations. “Philosophy just puts everything before us, and\nneither explains nor deduces anything.—Since everything lies\nopen to view there is nothing to explain” (PI 126). The\nanti-theoretical stance is reminiscent of the early Wittgenstein, but\nthere are manifest differences. Although the Tractatus\nprecludes philosophical theories, it does construct a systematic\nedifice which results in the general form of the proposition, all the\nwhile relying on strict formal logic; the Investigations\npoints out the therapeutic non-dogmatic nature of philosophy, verily\ninstructing philosophers in the ways of therapy. “The work of\nthe philosopher consists in marshalling reminders for a particular\npurpose” (PI 127).  Working with reminders and series\nof examples, different problems are solved. Unlike\nthe Tractatus which advanced one philosophical method, in\nthe Investigations “there is not a single philosophical\nmethod, though there are indeed methods, different therapies, as it\nwere” (PI 133d). This is directly related to\nWittgenstein’s eschewal of the logical form or of any\na-priori generalization that can be discovered or made in\nphilosophy. Trying to advance such general theses is a temptation\nwhich lures philosophers; but the real task of philosophy is both to\nmake us aware of the temptation and to show us how to overcome\nit. Consequently “a philosophical problem has the form: ‘I\ndon’t know my way about.’” (PI 123), and hence\nthe aim of philosophy is “to show the fly the way out of the\nfly-bottle” (PI 309). \n\nThe style of the Investigations is strikingly different from\nthat of the Tractatus. Instead of strictly numbered sections\nwhich are organized hierarchically in programmatic order, the\nInvestigations fragmentarily voices aphorisms about\nlanguage-games, family resemblance, forms of life, “sometimes\njumping, in a sudden change, from one area to another”\n(PI Preface). This variation in style is of course essential\nand is “connected with the very nature of the\ninvestigation” (PI Preface). As a matter of fact,\nWittgenstein was acutely aware of the contrast between the two stages\nof his thought, suggesting publication of both texts together in order\nto make the contrast obvious and clear. \n\nStill, it is precisely via the subject of the nature of philosophy\nthat the fundamental continuity between these two stages, rather than\nthe discrepancy between them, is to be found. In both cases philosophy\nserves, first, as critique of language. It is through analyzing\nlanguage’s illusive power that the philosopher can expose the traps of\nmeaningless philosophical formulations. This means that what was\nformerly thought of as a philosophical problem may now dissolve “and\nthis simply means that the philosophical problems should\ncompletely disappear” (PI 133). Two implications of\nthis diagnosis, easily traced back in the Tractatus, are to\nbe recognized. One is the inherent dialogical character of philosophy,\nwhich is a responsive activity: difficulties and torments are\nencountered which are then to be dissipated by philosophical therapy.\nIn the Tractatus, this took the shape of advice: “The correct\nmethod in philosophy would really be the following: to say nothing\nexcept what can be said, i.e. propositions of natural science …\nand then whenever someone else wanted to say something metaphysical,\nto demonstrate to him that he had failed to give a meaning to certain\nsigns in his propositions” (TLP 6.53) The second, more far-\nreaching, “discovery” in the Investigations “is the one that\nenables me to break off philosophizing when I want to”\n(PI 133). This has been taken to revert back to the ladder\nmetaphor and the injunction to silence in the Tractatus. \n\nIt has been submitted that the writings of the period from 1946 until\nhis death (1951) constitute a distinctive phase of Wittgenstein’s\nthought. These writings include, in addition to the second part of the\nfirst edition of the Philosophical Investigations, texts\nedited and collected in volumes such as Remarks on\nColour, Remarks on the Philosophy of\nPsychology, Zettel, On Certainty, and parts\nof The Foundations of Mathematics. Besides dealing with\nmathematics and psychology, this is the stage at which Wittgenstein\nmost seriously pursued questions traditionally recognized as\nepistemological. On Certainty tackles skeptical doubts and\nfoundational solutions but is, in typical Wittgensteinian fashion, a\nwork of therapy which discounts presuppositions common to both. This\nis intimately related to another of On Certainty’s\nthemes—the primacy of the deed to the word, or, in\nWittgenstein’s PI terminology, of form of life to\ngrammar. The general tenor of all the writings of this last period can\nthence be viewed as, on the one hand, a move away from the critical\n(some would say destructive) positions of the\nInvestigations to a more positive perspective on the same\nproblems that had been facing him since his early writings; on the\nother hand, this move does not constitute a break from the later\nperiod but is more properly viewed as its continuation, in a new\nlight.","contact.mail":"matar@post.tau.ac.il","contact.domain":"post.tau.ac.il"}]
