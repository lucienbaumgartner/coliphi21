(In practical philosophy—ethics and political\nphilosophy—his contributions are negligible.) He is perhaps best\nknown for his arguments against Logical Empiricism (in particular,\nagainst its use of the analytic-synthetic distinction). This argument,\nhowever, should be seen as part of a comprehensive world-view which\nmakes no sharp distinction between philosophy and empirical science,\nand thus requires a wholesale reorientation of the subject.\n\n\nIn what follows, a very brief section on Quine’s life and\nphilosophical work will be followed by an overview, which will serve to\norient the reader. We shall not comment in any detail on Quine’s\nwork in pure logic or set theory (for Quine’s work on set theory,\nsee Forster 2006). The third section is devoted to Quine’s\narguments against the use that the Logical Empiricists made of the\nanalytic-synthetic distinction, and the view that he worked out to take\nits place. The subsequent three sections go systematically through\nQuine’s own views; the final section is on Quine’s place in\nthe history of philosophy.\n\n\n1908: born, Akron, Ohio, on June 25th. \n\n1926–30: attended Oberlin College, Ohio; B.A, major in Mathematics\nwith honors reading in mathematical philosophy. \n\n1930–32: attended Harvard University; Ph.D. in Philosophy,\ndissertation on Whitehead and Russell’s Principia\nMathematica. \n\n1932–33: held a Sheldon Traveling Fellowship and visited (most\nnotably) Vienna, Warsaw, and Prague (where Carnap was then\nteaching). \n\n1933–36: a Junior Fellow in Harvard’s newly-formed Society of\nFellows; worked chiefly on logic and set theory. \n\n1934: published A System of Logistic, a revised version of\nhis dissertation. \n\n1936–78: held teaching positions at Harvard, first as Faculty\nInstructor, then as Associate Professor (1941) and then as Professor\n(1948). \n\n1940: published Mathematical Logic. \n\n1942–45: U.S. Navy, working chiefly in Naval intelligence. \n\n1953: published From a Logical Point of View. \n\n1960: published Word and Object. \n\n1963: published Set Theory and its Logic. \n\n1966: published Ways of Paradox. \n\n1969: published Ontological Relativity and Other\nEssays. \n\n1974: published The Roots of Reference. \n\n1981: published Theories and Things. \n\n1990: published Pursuit of Truth. \n\n1995: published From Stimulus to Science. \n\n2000: died, Boston, Massachusetts, December 25t.h. \n\n(Note: for the sake of brevity, we have listed only Quine’s\nmost notable books, including collections of essays.)  \n\nQuine’s philosophical thought is remarkably consistent over\nthe course of his long working life. There are developments, of course,\nbut outright changes of mind are relatively rare and mostly on\nrelatively minor points. We can, for the most part, treat him as having\na single philosophical orientation, to which what he calls\n“naturalism” is fundamental. This is not to say that his\nnaturalism is self-conscious and explicit from the start; it is,\nrather, something that he became clearer about over the years. (For the\ndevelopment of Quine’s naturalism, see Verhaegh, 2018.) \n\nThe term “naturalism” has been understood in various\nways; we need to see what Quine’s naturalism comes to. At one\npoint, he describes naturalism as “the recognition that it is\nwithin science itself, and not in some prior philosophy, that reality\nis to be identified and described” (1981, 21). Two points\nare important to note about the idea of “science” here.\nFirst, it is less restrictive than it may seem. Quine certainly takes\nthe natural sciences, especially physics, as paradigmatic. As he says\nhimself, however, he uses the word “science” broadly; he\nexplicitly includes psychology, economics, sociology, and history (see\n1995, 49). Second, Quine does not see scientific knowledge as different\nin kind from our ordinary knowledge; he sees it, rather, as the result\nof attempts to improve our ordinary knowledge of the world:\n“Science is not a substitute for common sense but an extension of\nit.” (1957, 229). The scientist, he says, “is\nindistinguishable from the common man in his sense of evidence, except\nthat the scientist is more careful.” (1957, 233). We might add\nthat the scientist is more narrowly focused on issues of truth and\nobjectivity and, in the hope of contributing to these goals, clearer\nand more systematic. \n\nMany philosophers would no doubt accept that the methods and\ntechniques of science are the best way to find out about the world.\n(With or without the points just noted about the word\n“science”.) The distinctiveness of Quine’s naturalism\nbegins to emerge if we ask what justifies this naturalistic claim: what\nreason do we have to believe that the methods and techniques of science\nare the best way to find out about the world? Quine would insist that\nthis claim too must be based on natural science. (If this is\ncircular, he simply accepts the circularity.) This is the revolutionary\nstep: naturalism self-applied. There is no foundation for Quine’s\nnaturalism: it is not based on anything else. \n\nThe point here is that Quine denies that there is a\ndistinctively philosophical standpoint, which might, for example,\nallow philosophical reflection to prescribe standards to science as a\nwhole. He holds that all of our attempts at knowledge are subject to\nthose standards of evidence and justification which are most explicitly\ndisplayed, and most successfully implemented, in the natural sciences.\nThis applies to philosophy as well as to other branches of knowledge.\nThe epistemologist, therefore, reflects on science from within science;\nthere is no theory of knowledge distinct from science.\n“Epistemology”, Quine says, “…is contained in\nnatural science, as a chapter of psychology” (1969, 83). (For an\nalternative view of the relation of philosophy to science, based on\ndiscussion of the history of science, see Friedman, 1997.) \n\nIn Quine’s view, philosophers can, therefore, do no better\nthan to adopt the standpoint of the best available knowledge, i.e.\nscience, in some suitably broad sense. We adopt what he calls\n“the fundamental conceptual scheme of science and common\nsense” (1960, 276). Philosophers are thus to be constrained by\nscientific standards. In (1974) he puts it this way: “In our\naccount of how science might be acquired we do not try to justify\nscience by some prior and firmer philosophy, but neither are we to\nmaintain less than scientific standards. Evidence must regularly be\nsought in external objects, out where observers can jointly observe\nit….” (1974, 34f.) \n\nThe view sketched above has both positive and negative aspects. The\nlatter are better-known, and Quine is often thought of as a negative\nphilosopher, primarily concerned to criticize others. He casts doubt on\nterms which many philosophers take for granted. He does not dismiss\nsuch terms as meaningless, but simply as not meriting a place in\nserious science, or in the objective account of the world at which\nscience aims. A well-known and important example is his criticism of\nthe idea of meaning, in the sense of the meaning of a particular\nsentence or statement. Quine says: “Meaning… is a worthy\nobject of philosophical and scientific clarification and analysis,\nand… it is ill-suited for use as an instrument of philosophical\nand scientific clarification and analysis.” (1981, 185). The term\nis insufficiently clear, and putative explanations which employ it are\nin fact unexplanatory; by engendering the illusion of explanation they\ntend to impede the progress of science. So philosophers should not rely\non the term. He makes similar remarks about “thought”,\n“belief”, “experience”,\n“necessity”, and other terms which many philosophers assume\nare legitimate and available for philosophical use without themselves\nrequiring explanation and justification in other terms. (For an\nillustration of Quine’s attitude towards the term\n“meaning” as used by one such philosopher, see his reply to\nPagin in Orenstein and Kokato, 420f.) \n\nThis criticism of the scientific and philosophical use of certain\nordinary terms goes along with rejection of philosophical questions\nwhich make essential use of those terms. For example, many philosophers\nhold that there are important philosophical problems concerning\nknowledge: Do we really know anything at all? What exactly are the\nconditions on knowledge? (This latter question has seemed especially\npressing since Gettier, 1963.) Quine, by contrast, finds the word\n“knowledge” vague, and consequently rejects it for serious\nuse, saying that the word is ‘‘useful and unobjectionable\nin the vernacular where we acquiesce in vagueness, but unsuited to\ntechnical use because of lacking a precise boundary’’\n(1984, 295). Accordingly, many such questions formulated using the term\nmay simply be dismissed, even if it remains eminently useful for making\nrough sorts of claim, when we say as above that scientific knowledge is\nnot different in kind from our ordinary knowledge. \n\nAs we have just seen, Quine’s views issue in very general\ncriticism of much philosophy and indeed of the assumption that the term\n“knowledge” marks a clear subject of inquiry. It is,\nnevertheless, a mistake to think of him as primarily a critical or\nnegative thinker: his criticisms rely on his positive doctrine, which\nin turn generates further questions. As for whether those are genuinely\nphilosophical questions, it is implicit in what has already\nbeen said that he would not acknowledge such a category as the\n‘genuinely philosophical’ if that is meant to\nimply questions which are different in kind from those of science. But\ncertainly he accepts that some questions are sufficiently general,\nabstract, and remote from observation, that they may be classified as\nphilosophical. At times he assimilates the questions with which he is\nconcerned to those which have traditionally occupied philosophers.\nEpistemology—the theory of knowledge—is a clear example,\nalthough Quine’s approach to that subject is quite different from\nthat of many philosophers. \n\nIn some places, Quine approaches epistemology through the problem of\nscepticism about the external world. But he has no room for the kind of\nscepticism which asks the following kind of question: even if our\nalleged knowledge, our science, is completely successful in its\npredictions, how do we know that it tells us the way the world really\nis? (See Alston, 1993.) Thus Quine says:\n \n\nThis dismissal of one kind of scepticism is an example of\nQuine’s naturalism, and indicates how he understands that\nidea.  \n\nThere is, however, a way of understanding the sceptical question\nwhich Quine takes seriously. Philosophers have been concerned with the\ngap between what is given in experience and the knowledge that we take\nourselves to have. Quine invokes gestalt psychology and argues that the\nsimple sensory ideas which Berkeley and Hume had claimed were given by\nthe senses are not in fact given, that we see things in\nthree-dimensions, for example, instead of having to infer the third. He\ndoes not, however, conclude that there is no problem at all here.\nRather, he says, “the problem was real but wrongly viewed”\n(1974, 2). Epistemology, as he sees it, is here “confronting a\nchallenge to natural science that arises from within natural\nscience.” (loc. cit.). What is the challenge? It starts\nwith what Quine takes to be “a finding of natural science\nitself… that our information about the world comes only through\nimpacts on our sensory receptors” (1990a, 19). The sceptical\nchallenge is then: “How… could one hope to find out about\nthat external world from such meager traces? In short, if our science\nwere true, how could we know it?” (1974, 2). \n\nScepticism, understood in this fashion, is a challenge to\nQuine’s form of naturalism. It questions whether our knowledge\ncan be accounted for in terms which are, by Quine’s standards,\npurely naturalistic. Quine’s response is thus to sketch an\nausterely naturalistic account of how our knowledge, and the cognitive\nlanguage in which that knowledge is embodied, arises, or might arise.\nThis project, as he sees it, is essential to the defence of his\nnaturalistic world-view. (Section 4. will go into more detail about the\nproject.)  \n\nWhen Quine asks: “How… could one hope to find out about\nthat external world from such meager traces?” this is not a\nrhetorical question. It is, rather, a serious question, to be answered\nby deploying the full resources of our knowledge; it is a scientific\nquestion. Quine recognizes that the question, thus construed, is not\nexactly what earlier epistemologists had in mind, but argues that the\nchange is justified: “A far cry, this, from the old epistemology.\nYet it is no gratuitous change of subject matter, but an enlightened\npersistence rather in the original epistemological problem.”\n(1974, 3). \n\nThe defence and articulation of Quine’s naturalism requires\nQuinean epistemology, an analogue of traditional epistemology but\ncarried out as a scientific enterprise. It also requires that he set\nout, in outline, what is to be included in a naturalistic account of\nthe world; in other words, it requires an account of the world, a least\nin broad outline. Among other things, this account constrains his\nepistemology, since that is to be a naturalistic account of\nknowledge. \n\nIn what follows, we shall sometimes speak of Quine’s account\nof the world as his “metaphysics”, but it is metaphysics\nnaturalized: it is not carried out a priori, or by reflection\non the nature of Being quâ Being, or anything of that\nsort. (Quine himself does not much use the word\n“metaphysics”. He puts forward views on metaphysical\ntopics—such as ontology, time, and abstract objects—but\nwithin the confines of his naturalism.) \n\nQuine approaches his naturalistic analogue of metaphysics through\nthe idea of regimented theory. Regimented theory is our overall\nscience, the sum total of our best and most objective knowledge about\nthe world, reformulated in the clearest and simplest form. Quine sees\nthis kind of reformulating as of a piece with ordinary scientific\nendeavours, but carried further than working scientists are likely to\nhave reason to do. He discusses the distorting effect which language is\nlikely to have on our view of the world and comments: \nRegimented theory is, of course, an idealization. It is not a\ncomplete and finished object, available for us to examine.\nQuine’s reflections on it might be considered as something like a\nthought-experiment: if we were to set about assembling our total theory\nof the world and recasting it in the best form, what would it look\nlike? Since the enterprise is not in fact going to be carried out all\nthe way we are not going to get a detailed answer. But on some\nimportant general issues, Quine holds, we can get answers. In\nparticular, he argues that the framework of regimented theory is\nfirst-order logic with identity (and so that theory is extensional);\nthat the variables of this theory range only over physical objects and\nsets; and that the predicates of the theory, the only non-logical\nvocabulary, are physicalistic, in his somewhat complicated sense. (See\nsection 5, below.) Although this is not traditional a priori\nmetaphysics, we should not underestimate the ambition of the project.\nHe says of his regimented theory that “all traits of reality\nworthy of the name can be set down in an idiom of this austere form if\nin any idiom” (1960, 228) and speaks of “limning the true\nand ultimate structure of reality” (1960, 221). The claim\nthat the variables of regimented theory range only over physical\nobjects and sets is, as far as he is concerned, the claim that only\nphysical objects and sets really exist. \n\nThe philosophers who most influenced Quine were the Logical\nEmpiricists (also known as Logical Positivists), especially Rudolf\nCarnap. The distinction between analytic truths and synthetic truths\nplays a crucial role in their philosophy. Analytic truths might be\ncharacterized as those true solely in virtue of the meanings of the\nwords they contain, or of the rules of the language, or something of\nthe sort. Synthetic truths, by contrast, state matters of\nextra-linguistic fact, and are known by experience. The Logical\nEmpiricists accounted for truths which do not seem to be answerable to\nexperience, most obviously the truths of logic and mathematics, by\nsaying that they are analytic. This position was very widely held by\nthe 1940s. Quine, however, famously casts doubt on\nanalytic-synthetic distinction, and rejects the use made of it by\nthe Logical Empiricists and other philosophers from the 1930s on.\n(Notable among the others is C. I. Lewis, first a teacher and then a\ncolleague of Quine; his influence on Quine has perhaps been\nunderestimated. See Baldwin 2013, Ben-Menahem 2016, and Sinclair\n2016.) \n\nThe issues here are complex, and the argument takes many twists and\nturns. The aim of this section is to give an account of Quine’s\nmature view, and of the strongest arguments that he has for it. \n\nCarnap holds that the role of philosophy is to analyze and clarify\nthe language of science, and to formulate and recommend alternative\nlanguages. After 1932, he holds that there are languages which differ\nin expressive power, not merely as notational variants. The difference\nbetween intuitionistic logic and classical logic is an important\nexample here, as is the difference between the language of Newtonian\nmechanics and the language of relativistic mechanics. (Earlier, he\nsays, he had ‘overlooked the fact that there is a multiplicity of\npossible languages’, Carnap 1934, 245; cf. also 322 of the same\nwork.) Within a given language, there may be only one correct theory on\na given subject. But the choice of a language is in that respect unlike\nthe choice of a theory. In deciding which theory is correct, we will\nappeal to observations but also to the rules of the language; no such\nappeal is possible when we are choosing a language, for in this case it\nis the rules themselves that we are choosing. So Carnap holds that\nthere is no one correct language. This idea has become known\nas the Principle of Tolerance; from the 1930s on, it is fundamental to\nCarnap’s view of what philosophy is and how it differs from\nscience. (That there is such a difference is a point which Carnap never\nquestions.) Because there is no one correct language, it is no part of\nthe philosopher’s job to prescribe this or that language, merely\nto analyze, to clarify, and to suggest alternatives. \n\nThe Principle of Tolerance requires the analytic-synthetic\ndistinction. It requires that we can, in all cases, distinguish between\ntheoretical changes which involve a change of meaning, and hence,\nstrictly speaking, a change of language, and those which do not. The\nformer kind of change involves analytic sentences, and is a matter for\nTolerance; the latter involves only synthetic sentences, and Tolerance\ndoes not apply. The use of the Principle of Tolerance thus presupposes\na clear distinction between the analytic sentences of the language and\nits synthetic sentences. \n\nAt least as Quine sees the matter, the use of the Principle of\nTolerance puts analytic sentences on an entirely different\nepistemological footing from synthetic sentences. Synthetic sentences\nare answerable to evidence; analytic sentences are a matter of the\nchoice of language, which does not require theoretical justification.\nQuine, however, rejects the idea that there is such an epistemological\ndifference. Even if we can distinguish the analytic sentences from the\nsynthetic sentences, we may still have reasons to reject an analytic\nsentence. And those reasons may be of the same kind that lead us to\nreject synthetic sentences. This point is hard to see if one focuses on\nexamples such as “All bachelors are unmarried”. The matter\nis otherwise if one considers examples such as “Force equals mass\ntimes acceleration”. (See Putnam, 1962.) A change of mind\nabout an analytic sentence would be a change in the language. Still, we\nmight have reasons to make such a change, reasons that are of the same\nsort that lead us to make revisions to synthetic sentences. In that\ncase, we have no more reason to apply Tolerance in the one kind of case\nthan in the other. \n\nThis is the view that Quine argues for. On the one hand, he\nemphasizes the point (which Carnap largely accepts) that choice of\nlanguage is not theoretically neutral: some choices will make for a\nbetter theory than others. On the other hand, he argues that\n‘pragmatic’ factors, such as simplicity, which Carnap\nhad accepted as playing a role in choice of language, also play a role\nin the choice of a theory within a language. Hence, he claims, the two\nsorts of choice are on the same epistemological footing, and the\nPrinciple of Tolerance is unjustified. \n\nQuine’s argument for this position relies on holism.\nThis is the claim that most of our sentences do not have implications\nfor experience when they are taken one-by-one, each in isolation from\nthe others. What has experiential implication is, in most cases, not an\nindividual sentence but a larger chunk of theory. Holism is not a very\ncontroversial doctrine. (Carnap accepts it; see Carnap, 1934, 318.)\nQuine claims that holism shows that most of our sentences are not\njustified by the relation of the individual sentence, considered in\nisolation, to experience. Almost always, what matters is the relation\nto experience of some larger chunk of theory (in principle, although\nperhaps never in practice, of the theory as a whole). This means that\nin principle the correctness of a given claim is almost never settled\nsimply by looking at the empirical evidence for that claim alone. Other\nfactors will play a role, in particular the way in which accepting the\ngiven claim would contribute to the efficacy and simplicity of the\ntheory as a whole. But these are precisely the ‘pragmatic\nfactors’ which Carnap thought played a role in the choice of\nlanguage. In arguing that such factors play a role throughout our\nknowledge, Quine accepts ‘a more thorough pragmatism’\n(1951, 46) which puts Carnap’s external changes on the same\nepistemological footing as his internal changes. (Quine’s early\naccount of these matters is extremely sketchy. For elaboration, see\nQuine 1991 and 1996; for criticism of the sketchy account, see Sober\n2000.) \n\nIf logic, mathematics, and other putatively a priori parts\nof our knowledge, are not to be explained by analyticity, how are they\nto be accounted for? Holism, which is central to Quine’s argument\nagainst Carnap, also provides him with an alternative position. It\nseems as if logic and mathematics have a special status because they\nare independent of experience. They appear to be necessary and not\nsusceptible of refutation by what future experience brings; they appear\nto be a priori because we know them independent of experience.\nCarnap sought to explain these appearances by appealing to the idea\nthat accepting an analytic sentence of a given language goes with\nspeaking that language, and to the Principle of Tolerance. Since choice\nof language is not justified by experience, the truth of the analytic\nsentences of a given language is not answerable to experience. \n\nHow is Quine to explain the apparent necessity and a priori\nstatus of some truths without appeal to the Principle of Tolerance?\nQuine’s holism is the view that almost none of our knowledge is\ndirectly answerable to experience. (The exceptions are what he\ncalls ‘observation sentences’; see 4.2, below.) In almost\nall cases the relation is indirect: a given sentence is only answerable\nto experience if a body of theory is presupposed. (When we say that a\ngiven observation confirms or refutes a given theoretical claim, we are\ntacitly presupposing other theoretical knowledge.) This is most easily\nseen if we consider a highly theoretical sentence, but in Quine’s\nview it holds, of almost all our sentences. The reason to accept a\nsentence is its contribution to the success of theory as a whole as an\nefficient and simple method of dealing with and predicting experience;\nin principle, this means the success of our theory as a whole, the\nwhole body of sentences that we accept, in dealing with experience as a\nwhole. \n\nFor many of our sentences, this strong statement of holism holds\nonly in principle. In practice, we may have a good idea what\nexperiences would lead us to change our minds about a given sentence,\nand what further changes in theory would follow. Elementary arithmetic\n(to take that as an example) is different because it is involved in\nalmost every part of systematic knowledge. (In Quine’s well-known\nmetaphor, it stands near the centre of the ‘web of\nbelief’.) Abandoning it would mean abandoning our whole system of\nknowledge, and replacing it with an alternative which we have not even\nbegun to envisage. Nothing in principle rules out the possibility that\nthe course of experience will be such that our present system of\nknowledge becomes wholly useless, and that in constructing a new one we\nfind that arithmetic is of no use. But this is a purely abstract\npossibility, certainly not something we can imagine in any detail. So\nthe idea that we might reject arithmetic is likewise unimaginable;\nhence the truths of arithmetic appear to be necessary. \n\nFor similar reasons, arithmetic appears to be a priori. No\nparticular experience confirms ‘2 + 2 = 4’. (Quine is not\nadvancing what Frege derided as a ‘gingerbread and pebble’\naccount of arithmetic (Frege 1884, vii), in which the sentence is\njustified by our observations of cookies or stones.) Arithmetic is\nindependent of any particular experience, or any easily specifiable\nportion of experience; hence it appears as a priori. On\nQuine’s account, it rests on our experience as a whole, and the\nfact that the theory which best accounts for that experience makes\nessential use of arithmetic. \n\nAs we have just seen, even sentences which we cannot imagine\nrejecting might, in principle, be rejected. As Quine says: ‘no\nstatement is immune to revision’ (1951, 43; see Ebbs 2017, Ch.\n8). This claim of Quine’s has attracted a good deal of attention,\nand is sometimes thought to be shocking or even paradoxical. In the\ncontext of his debate with Carnap, however, it is not, by itself, at\nall surprising. For Carnap too, any sentence can be revised; he would\ninsist, however, that in the case of some sentences, the analytic ones,\na revision involves a change of language, and thus of the meaning of\nthe words used in the sentence. So the idea of meaning, and sameness of\nmeaning, occupies a crucial role in the debate over analyticity. \n\nQuine’s initial arguments against the analytic-synthetic\ndistinction seek to cast doubt on the idea that there is a notion of\nmeaning which is clear enough to use in defining a notion of\nanalyticity. He explores various proposals and finds them wanting. (See\nespecially Quine 1951.) Here too a crucial role is played by holism.\nOne apparently clear conception of meaning is that the meaning of a\nsentence is given by the experiences which would confirm it; holism,\nhowever, implies that the idea of confirmation does not apply to\nindividual sentences, considered in isolation from the theories of\nwhich they are parts. (For criticism see Fodor and Lepore 1992; for a\ncounter to Fodor and Lepore see Heal 1994; for later Quine on holism\nsee his 1991.) \n\nQuine’s scepticism about the idea of meaning is much\ncriticized. We will mention two criticisms. First, what standards of\nclarity is he employing, when he says that the notion of analyticity is\ninsufficiently clear? The answer, not explicit in (Quine, 1951), is\nthat the standards are those indicated by our discussion in the\nprevious section; Quine is asking for an explanation which is\nacceptable by his naturalistic standards (see Lugg 2012). Such an\nexplanation would not presuppose an idea of meaning, and would use such\nideas as definition or convention only in ways which are justified by\nthe literal sense of those terms. Second, some responses to\nQuine’s position here argue that it has obviously absurd\nconsequences, such as that meaningful discourse would be impossible or\nthat we could not understand our language. (See, for example, Grice and\nStrawson, 1956.) But Quine’s scepticism about meanings\ndoes not lead to any scepticism about meaningfulness. If we\nthink of meaningfulness as a matter of having a meaning then\nwe may think that our words cannot be meaningful unless there are\nmeanings. But such a way of thinking is, Quine claims, quite\nmisleading. In (Quine 1953), he offers a rough and ready behavioural\naccount of meaningfulness; it is clear from the way the account\nproceeds that the success of something along those lines would be of no\nhelp at all in defining synonymy or analyticity. \n\nWe said above that Quine seeks ‘to cast doubt’ on the\nidea of meaning, and on the use of that idea to explain the distinction\nbetween those changes of doctrine which involve a change of meaning and\nthose which do not, and thus also to explain analyticity. One might\nread (Quine 1951) and get the impression that he is not merely casting\ndoubt but wholly rejecting these ideas. In later works, however, he\nhimself suggests a definition of analyticity. A sentence is analytic\nfor a given native speaker ‘if he learned the truth of the\nsentence by learning to use one or more of its words’ (Quine,\n1991, 270; see also Quine 1974, 78–80.) It is analytic without\nqualification if it is analytic for all native speakers. By this\ncriterion, some obvious truths, such as ‘Bachelors are\nunmarried’, will presumably count as analytic. If we think of the\nset of analytic sentences as closed under logical consequence, as Quine\nsuggests, then, he says, all first-order logical truths ‘would\nthen perhaps qualify as analytic’ (Quine, 1991, 270). Along\nwith this, he comes to accept that certain revisions of belief do\ninvolve a change of meaning, presumably in a sufficiently clear sense\nof meaning (Quine, 1991, 270). \n\nNow it might seem as if Quine completely withdraws his earlier\ncriticism of the analytic-synthetic distinction and thus, presumably,\nof Logical Empiricism as a whole. But in fact this is not so. One\nconsideration here is the scope of Quinean analyticity. The idea will\nperhaps (as Quine says) include first-order logic, but it will not\ninclude mathematics; on this count alone, it is clear that it will not\ndo what Carnap requires of the idea of analyticity. An even more\nimportant consideration is that Quine’s version of the\nanalytic-synthetic distinction is not an epistemological distinction.\nSome changes of doctrine involve changes of meaning, others do not. In\nQuine’s view, however, this does not mean that the two sorts of\nchange must have different epistemological bases. To the contrary: as\nwe saw in 3.1, Quine rejects the Principle of Tolerance and, with it,\nthe idea that a change of language takes place on a different kind of\nepistemological basis from a change of theory within a language. His\nacceptance of a limited conception of analyticity does not change this\npicture. As he says: “I recognize the notion of analyticity in\nits obvious and useful but epistemologically insignificant\napplications” (1991, 271; emphasis added). \n\nOn the interpretation advanced here, Quine’s rejection of the\nPrinciple of Tolerance is the deepest aspect of his disagreement with\nCarnap. Quine sees all our cognitive endeavours, whether they involve\nformulating a new language or making a small-scale theoretical change,\nas having the same very general aim of enabling us to deal with the\nworld better; all such endeavours have the same very general kind of\njustification, namely, as contributing to that end. In this picture,\nthere is no basis for Carnap’s insistence that philosophy is in\nprinciple different from science. Philosophy, as Quine sees it,\nhas no special vantage point, no special method, no special access to\ntruth. Here we have the crucial idea of Quine’s naturalism,\ndiscussed in the previous section. \n\nAs we saw in section 2, Quine takes the fundamental epistemological\nproblem to be that of showing how we come to have knowledge of the\nworld. He seeks an account which is naturalistic in his austere sense,\nand thus starts with the idea that we know about the world only from\nimpacts of various forms of energy on our sensory nerves (see 2.3,\nabove). How do we get from such impacts to something recognizable as\nknowledge of the world? In the words of the title of Quine’s last\nmonograph: how do we get from stimulus to science? \n\nThis question is central for Quine’s scientific naturalism in\ngeneral. An answer would show that that world-view can accommodate an\naccount of human knowledge. If no answer is available, that world-view\nis cast in doubt. For these purposes it is perhaps enough if Quine can\nsketch an account, compatible with his naturalistic view, of how we\nmight acquire the knowledge which we take ourselves to have,\nwhether or not it is correct in detail. (See Quine 1990c, 291.) \n\nQuine treats knowledge as embodied in language. Apart from other\nconsiderations, language-use is observable and thus subject to\nscientific inquiry. Quine’s concern with how we might acquire\nknowledge thus takes the form of a concern with how we might acquire\ncognitive language. But his interest here is in epistemology, rather\nthan in language for its own sake: “I am interested in the flow\nof evidence from the triggering of the senses to the pronouncements of\nscience…. It is these epistemological concerns, and not my\nincidental interest in linguistics, that motivate my\nspeculations.” (1990b, 3). \n\nMuch of Quine’s work in epistemology is thus a discussion of\nhow a child might acquire cognitive language. This genetic project may\nseem to be a long way from the traditional concerns of epistemology.\nQuine claims, however, that the project in fact affords us the best\nobtainable insight into the nature of the evidence for our theories,\nand into the relation between theory and evidence: “the\nevidential relation is virtually enacted, it would seem, in the\nlearning.” (1975b, 74–75). \n\nCentral to Quine’s naturalistic account of knowledge is the\nidea that all our knowledge is in some way based upon stimulations of\nour sensory nerves. For much of our knowledge, the relation is quite\nindirect. (This is one way of expressing holism; see 3.1, above.) Most\nsentences are not accepted because of a direct relation between the\ngiven sentence and stimulations of nerve endings; the connection goes\nvia other sentences, and may be quite indirect and remote. But\nthen there must presumably be some sentences which are directly related\nto stimulations. This is the role that observation sentences play in\nQuine’s thought. Acts of uttering such sentences, or of assenting\nto them when they are uttered by others, are shared responses to\nstimulation. (We shall enter some qualifications at the end of this\nsub-section.) \n\nObservation sentences are the starting point for our acquisition of\nknowledge, the child’s entry into cognitive language. They are\nalso the sentences which are evidentially basic. What fits them to play\nboth roles is that they are (largely) independent of other parts of our\nlanguage. Hence they can (largely) be mastered by a child otherwise\nwithout linguistic competence, and known without presupposing other\nparts of our theory. (The reason for the qualification will become\napparent at the end of this sub-section.) \n\nMany philosophers are content to take for granted the idea of an\nevidentially basic sentence. Quine, however, cannot take that attitude;\nhe needs to show how we get “from stimulus to science”. The\nfirst step is to show that we can give a purely naturalistic account of\nhow some linguistic utterances can be directly tied to the occurrence\nof stimulations of the sensory nerves---an account of observation\nsentences, more or less. Quine expends enormous labour on this\npoint. \n\nQuine considers acts of assenting to sentences (or dissenting; but\nwe shall mostly leave that as understood). He focuses, in particular,\non our dispositions to assent to sentences. (We will briefly\nconsider the idea of a disposition in the next section.) To be an\nobservation sentence, a sentence must fulfill two criteria, one\nindividualistic and one social. The individualistic criterion is that a\nsentence is an observation sentence for a given person if he or she is\ndisposed to assent to it when, and only when, he or she is undergoing\nappropriate sensory stimulations, regardless of her internal state\n(e.g. the ancillary information which he or she possesses).\n“It’s warm in here” presumably satisfies this\ncriterion; my willingness to assent to it perhaps depends only on which\nof my sensory nerves are stimulated at the given moment. \n“There’s milk in the refrigerator” presumably does\nnot; unless I am actually looking into the refrigerator at the time, my\nwillingness to assent to it depends not on what I am experiencing at\nthe time but on my internal state, what I remember. The social\ncriterion is that the individualistic criterion should hold across the\nlinguistic community as a whole. To specify this more precisely is\ntricky, and we shall postpone the matter for a few paragraphs. \n\nEven the individualistic criterion raises considerable complications\nand difficulties. We speak of a disposition to assent (or dissent) in\nresponse to a pattern of stimulation but this is not quite accurate.\nSuch a pattern, a complete list of which sensory nerves are firing, and\nin which order, will hardly ever repeat itself. So what we need is,\nrather, the idea of a correlation of a response with a type of\nstimulation\n pattern.[1]\nBut the relevant idea of a\ntype here is complicated. The physical resemblance of two stimulation\npatterns, what Quine calls receptual similarity, is\nnot enough to make them constitute events of the same type, in the\nrelevant sense; two such patterns may resemble each other very closely\nyet lead to quite different responses. (Two occasions on which I am\ndriving a car may be almost identical in terms of my stimulation\npatterns, except that on one occasion I see a red light and on the\nother I see a green light. As far as my response goes, that small\ndifference outweighs all the similarities.) What is wanted is a more\ncomplex notion which Quine calls perceptual similarity. Very\nroughly, two stimulation patterns count as similar (for an animal, at a\ntime) if they tend to lead to the same\n response.[2] \n\nWith the account of perceptual similarity in place, we can say what\nit is for a sentence to be observational for me: if I am disposed to\nassent to it on one occasion on which I have a certain neural intake,\nthen I will also be disposed to assent to it on any other occasion on\nwhich I have neural intake which is (sufficiently) perceptually similar\nfor me at that time. \n\nIt is worth emphasizing the fact that the definition of the key\nnotion of perceptual similarity is behavioural. It avoids any idea of\nexperience, of awareness, of what strikes the person (or other animal)\nas more similar to what. It is simply a matter of responses, and thus\nof behaviour. (Assent is also treated as behavior, as sound-making\npropensities; see 1975c pp. 87–88). This is in accord with\nQuine’s insistence on what he takes to be scientific standards of\nclarity and rigour. One consequence of it is that the notion cannot be\ninvoked to explain behaviour. Quine is under no illusions on\nthis score. (See 1975c, 87, where the point is explicit.) The\nbehavioural account does not explain our understanding of\nobservation sentences; explanation, if possible at all, comes at the\nneuro-physiological level. What the behavioural account does is to make\nclear exactly what behaviour constitutes that understanding and, hence,\nwhat the neuro-physiological account would have to explain. (It also\nshows that there is indeed something to be explained.) \n\nSo far we have only an account of what it is for a sentence to be an\nobservation sentence for a particular person. But our language is\nshared, as it must be if it is to enable us to communicate with one\nanother. So we need to generalize the criterion across the linguistic\ncommunity. One might at first think that the social criterion would be:\nif one person is disposed to assent to the sentence on any occasion on\nwhich he or she has a certain neural intake, then any other person\nhaving the same neural intake will also be disposed to assent to it.\nQuine gives essentially this account in (1960). As he quickly comes to\nsee, however, it is not tenable, for it assumes that we can make sense\nof the idea of “same neural intake” between different\npeople. But different people have different sensory nerves (and there\nis no reason to suppose that one person’s sensory nerves are\nhomologous to those of others; see Quine 1969, chapter 6). \n\nQuine returned to this problem on and off over the next thirty-five\nyears. His eventual solution is that a sentence only counts as an\nobservation sentence if an occasion which leads to my having neural\nintake which disposes me to assent to it also leads to your having\nneural intake which disposes you to assent to it. Here there is no\ncross-person identification of neural intake or cross-person standards\nof perceptual similarity. On this account, however, there can only be\nobservation sentences if our standards of perceptual similarity line up\nin the right way. Two occasions which produce in me neural intakes\nwhich are perceptually similar by my standards must also (often enough)\nproduce in you neural intakes which are perceptually similar by your\nstandards. Quine is happy enough with this assumption of mutual\nattunement and suggests that it can be explained along evolutionary\nlines (see 1996, 160f.). \n\nWe have been explaining the idea of our having shared responses to\nstimulation. For the most part, Quine assumes that assent to an\nobservation sentence simply is such a response. This assumption,\nhowever, cannot be quite correct. It may look for all the world as if\nthere were a rabbit in front of me, even though there is not. If I have\nno reason to be suspicious I will be disposed to assent to\n“Rabbit?”; if I know about the deception, however, I will\nnot be. So my disposition to assent does not, after all, depend solely\non my sensory stimulations at the time. It depends also on my internal\nstate, whether I know that in this case the rabbit-like appearance is\nmisleading. The difficulty arises because “There’s a\nrabbit” is corrigible, a feature which, on most accounts, it\nshares with just about every sentence other than those about the\nspeaker’s current experience. If a sentence is corrigible then\nthere will be circumstances in which it is false, even though those\ncircumstances produce stimulation patterns which would generally lead\nobservers to assent to it. But then some observers may know that the\ncircumstances are of this deceptive kind and not be disposed to assent,\nwhile others have no such knowledge and are disposed to assent. The\nmoral of this is that assent, even to observation sentences, is not a\nmere response to stimulation; the responder’s internal state\n(having ancillary knowledge, or not) may also play a role. \n\nQuine does not seem to have fully appreciated this point, though\nsome of his later discussions come close to doing so (see, in\nparticular, Quine 1996). It is not fatal to his general account; it\ncomplicates the story rather than requiring a radical change. There may\nbe no sentences—at least none that satisfy the social criterion\nfor observationality—which can be wholly mastered simply by\nacquiring appropriate dispositions to assent and dissent in response to\ncurrent stimulations. For some sentences, however, acquiring such\ndispositions comes close to mastering their use, because those\nsentences are almost always true in those cases where\nobservers receive sensory stimulations which dispose them to assent.\n(Clearly this will be a matter of degree.) So the acquisition of the\nrelevant dispositions, and partial mastery of the sentence, can be used\nas a basis on which the child can learn more of the language, and more\nabout the world. This further learning in turn allows the child to\nmodify her or his original disposition to assent and dissent merely in\nresponse to current stimulation. \n\nQuine’s treatment of more sophisticated parts of language is\nnotably sketchier and more speculative than his detailed discussion of\nobservation sentences. In part this may be because he holds that it is\nmost important to understand the very first step into cognitive\nlanguage, how such language is possible at all. It may also be that the\ndifficulty of getting a satisfactory account of observation sentences\nimpeded him. \n\nBeyond these points, however, there is, from a Quinean perspective,\na limit to how detailed an account we should expect to have of the\nacquisition of sophisticated cognitive language. Mastery of an\nobservation sentence corresponds (more or less) to a relatively\nstraightforward disposition: to assent when receiving a stimulation\npattern within a certain range. For most sentences, however, this is\nnot the case. What disposition must one have acquired in order to count\nas understanding a sentence such as “The economy is in\nrecession”? No doubt the disposition to assent in response to\nevidence is required, but what counts as evidence is almost unmanageably diffuse.\nIn such a case, the links between sensory stimulation (such as that\ninduced by the sight of words in a newspaper) and assent are\n“multifarious [and] not easily reconstructed even in\nconjecture” (1960, 11). A relatively clear-cut account, of the\nsort that Quine gives of observation sentences, is simply not\navailable. \n\nSo Quine does not offer any sort of detailed account of the\nacquisition cognitive language beyond the observation sentences. (For\ncomparison of Quine’s approach here with the very different\napproach of Chomsky, see Smith 2014.) Instead, he considers stages on\nthe way, forms of language which one might suppose could be easily\nacquired by a child who has mastered observation sentences and which\nmight provide steps leading to yet more advanced language. \n\nOne such step, which is emphasized in Quine’s later work, is\nthe mastery of what he calls observation categoricals (1981 p. 28)\nThese are sentences of the form “Whenever X [happens], Y\n[happens]”, where the schematic letters are to be replaced by\nobservation sentences. (E.g. “Whenever there’s smoke,\nthere’s fire.”) It is plausible to suppose that a child who\nhas learnt the observation sentences can come by a mastery of the\nrelevant observation categorical. Observation sentences are what Quine\ncalls occasion sentences, true on some occasions and false on others,\nwhereas observation categoricals are eternal sentences, true or false\nonce for all. Quine suggests that we can think of observation\ncategoricals as a plausible first step towards a general mastery of\neternal sentences, which make up our serious theoretical knowledge. \n\nAnother step of the same kind is what Quine calls eternal\npredications, subject-predicate sentences true or false once for all,\nsuch as “Fido is a dog”. Assuming the child has learnt each\nterm as an observation sentence, the sight of the dog will dispose him\nto assent to each. Quine speculates that the sound of the word\n“Fido” may have something of the same effect as the sight\nof the beast, inclining our learner to assent to “Dog” and\nthus to “Fido is a dog”. It is notable that there is a sort\nof use-mention confusion operating here, if Quine’s suggestion is\ncorrect. Language is learnt by confusion and “short leaps of\nanalogy” rather than by “continuous derivation”\n(1975b, 77f.); indeed a holistic language cannot be learnt without such\nleaps. \n\nA further advance, in Quine’s view, takes place when the child\ncomes to use similar sentences but with two general terms, such as\n“Dogs are animals”. Such a sentence, Quine remarks is\n‘‘really a universal categorical, ‘Every α is a\nβ’.’’ (1974, 66). This kind of sentence, can be\nrepresented using pronouns (“If something is a dog then it is an\nanimal”) or, more or less equivalently, using the logical device\nof quantifiers and variables. Such sentences have a particular\nimportance for Quine in connection with the idea of reference. Merely\nto be able to use a name, to be able to name Fido upon seeing him, for\nexample, is not yet to refer; one might simply be using the term as a\nresponse to the sight of the dog, hence as an observation sentence.\nReference, as Quine sees the matter, requires the capacity to\nreidentify the object over time and changing circumstances: if a dog is\nbarking then it—that very same dog—is hungry; hence the\nimportance of pronouns. \n\nQuine also has things to say on more familiar epistemological\nthemes. In some cases he indicates how they can be integrated into his\napproach; thus he suggests that we can (albeit unrealistically)\nschematize the testing of a scientific theory by thinking of ourselves\nas deriving observation categoricals which can then be directly tested\nagainst observation sentences. In other cases he is content to adopt\nmore or less unchanged the account given by earlier authors, as in his\nlist of the virtues of a theory (see 1990a, 20). Our account above has\nstressed the most novel parts of his epistemology. \n\nOne issue left unaddressed above is the question whether\nQuine’s naturalized version of epistemology is normative. Some\ncommentators have claimed that it is not, and that this is a serious\ndefect (see Kim, 1988). Others claim that naturalized epistemology is\nnormative (see Gregory, 2008). Quine himself has weighed in, saying\nthat critics ‘are wrong in protesting that the normative\nelement…goes by the board’ (Quine, 1990a, 19). He cites\nthe ‘finding of natural science…that our information about\nthe world comes only through impacts on our sensory receptors’\n(Quine, 1990a, 19) as being normative, ‘warning us against\ntelepaths and soothsayers’ (Quine, 1990a, 19). More generally,\nnaturalized epistemology is concerned with ‘the whole strategy of\nrational conjecture in the framing of scientific hypotheses’\n(Quine, 1990a, 20). \n\nNaturalized epistemology is thus certainly normative in this sense:\nit tells us that in drawing up scientific theories we should\nrely on the evidence of the senses rather than on soothsayers; that we\nshould aim at simple theories, and so on. In telling us these\nthings, however, it relies on what we already know: it deploys some\nparts of our science to guide attempts in other areas. It does not take\na normative attitude towards science as a whole, criticizing or\njustifying it by wholly external, non-scientific standards. That would\nrequire a wholly extra-scientific position, an idea which Quine\nderogates as ‘First Philosophy’ (e.g. Quine 1981, 67). The\nrejection of any such idea is one way of phrasing the naturalism he\nadvocates. \n\nQuine takes seriously the idea that “it is within science\nitself, and not in some prior philosophy, that reality is to be\nidentified and described” (1981, 21). It follows from this idea,\nas he construes it, that our best scientific theory of the world tells\nus as much as we know about reality. (Our best theory at given time\ntells us as much as we know at that time; no doubt our views will\nprogress.) So setting out the broad outlines of that theory is the\nQuinean version or analogue of metaphysics, though he does not much use\nthe word. This subject interacts with that of the last section:\nQuine’s account of the world both lays down the constraints\nwithin which an account of knowledge must proceed, and is, in outline,\nthe knowledge that must be accounted for. \n\n How does Quine think we should establish the sort of claims\nthat we are calling “metaphysical”? Some points are\nfamiliar from our discussion in section 2. First, we do not resort to\nany special kind of philosophical insight. Second, what matters is\nordinary knowledge as refined and improved upon: science. Third, we\nrely upon the idea of regimented theory, science formulated in a\nlanguage that is clarified and simplified “beyond what might\nreasonably be urged upon the practicing scientist” (1957, 235;\nsee 2.4, above). We rely upon ordinary usage where no better is to\nhand, but accept changes that are improvements (see 1960, 3). A further\npoint is that in striving for the clarity and simplicity of our theory\nwe must consider the whole theory; local gains may be offset by global\nlosses. It is thus to overall regimented theory that we look when we\nare “limning the true and ultimate structure of reality”\n(1960, 221). \n\nWhat is Quine’s justification for relying on the idea of\nregimented theory, rather than on our ordinary conceptual scheme? (Cf.\nStrawson, 1959, Introduction.) One part of the answer is that just as\nscience is in the same line of business as ordinary knowledge, but does\nit better, so regimented language is in the same business as ordinary\nlanguage, but does it better. Regimentation, that is to say, is not the\nimposition of a wholly foreign language; it is the adoption of a\nlanguage that maximizes scientific virtues already partially present in\nordinary speech—logical structure, reference, the ready\namenability to algorithmic methods. But another part of the answer is\nthe idea that “our ordinary conceptual scheme” does not\npick out anything definite enough to answer metaphysical questions.\nThus Quine says: “…a fenced ontology is just not implicit\nin ordinary language…. Ontological concern is not a correction\nof a lay thought and practice; it is foreign to the lay culture, though\nan outgrowth of it.” (1981, 9). \n\nRegimentation, in Quine’s view, involves paraphrase into\nlogical notation. Such paraphrase greatly clarifies and simplifies our\ntheory. Inferences which are a matter of logic will be revealed as\nsuch; where additional assumptions are required it will be explicit\njust what is needed. The logic which Quine takes as the structure of\nregimented theory is classical (bivalent) first-order logic with\nidentity. Bivalence is justified on the grounds of simplicity. It is\nnot that we have some independent insight into the nature of the world\nwhich shows us that every sentence of regimented theory is either true\nor false. It is, rather, that the simplicity that we gain from making\nthis assumption, justifies our using a bivalent language; the\nmetaphysical claim follows along. (This reversal of direction should\nremind us of Carnap. The difference is that Quine does not accept the\nPrinciple of Tolerance; see section 3, above.) \n\nQuine’s choice of first-order logic, rather than second-order\nlogic, has been more controversial than his adoption of bivalence. One\nreason he gives for the decision is that every formalization of\nsecond-order logic (unlike first-order logic) is incomplete, relative\nto the standard semantics. A further reason is that one purpose of the\ncanonical framework is to enable us to assess the ontology of a theory.\nFrom this point of view it is an advantage that first-order logic has\nno ontological presuppositions of its own. (By adopting that logic we\ndo commit ourselves to there being some object or other, but not to the\nexistence of any particular entity.) Here again there is a clear\ncontrast with second-order logic, which does have ontological\npresuppositions. Exactly what those presuppositions are is unclear, and\nhas been debated; for Quine, this unclarity is a further reason to\navoid the subject entirely. \n\nParaphrasing a theory into classical logic imposes extensionality on\nit: a predicate may be replaced by a co-extensive predicate without\nchange of truth-value of the containing sentence; likewise an embedded\nsentence by a sentence of the same\n truth-value.[3]\nExtensionality imposes quite\nsevere restrictions. It requires, for example, that attributions of\nbelief, and other propositional attitudes, be regimented into a form\nquite different from that which they may appear to have. (For this\nreason, the commitment to extensionality is quite controversial; see\nFøllesdal 1986 and Kaplan 1968, 1986.) So one might suppose that\nQuine accepts extensionality reluctantly, as the price to be paid for\nthe advantages of the use of logic in regimenting theory. Such is not\nhis attitude, however. To the contrary, he thinks of the clarity that\nextensionality brings as a great advantage, and of theories that lack\nit as not fully comprehensible: “I find extensionality necessary,\nindeed, though not sufficient, for my full understanding of a\ntheory.” (1995, 90f.) \n\nQuine’s regimented theory, then, is the sum total of our\nknowledge, the best that we have, reformulated so as to fit into the\nframework of first-order logic. The extra-logical vocabulary consists\nonly of predicates. All metaphysical questions can thus be boiled down\nto two: What objects do the variables range over? and: What sorts of\nprimitive predicates are to be admitted? \n\nTo the first of these questions Quine offers a straightforward\nanswer: his ontology consists of physical objects and sets. He counts\nas a physical object the matter occupying any portion of space-time,\nhowever scattered the portion and however miscellaneous the occupants;\nsuch an object need not be what he calls a “body”, such as\na person or a tree or a building (see 1981, 13). He briefly entertains\nthe idea that we could manage without postulating matter at all, simply\nusing sets of space-time points, where these are understood as sets of\nquadruples of real numbers, relative to some co-ordinate system---that\nis, an ontology of abstract objects only. He seems to see no knock-down\nargument against this but abandons it, perhaps because the gain is too\nsmall to justify the magnitude of the departure from our ordinary\nviews. That he is willing to consider such a view, and take it\nseriously, shows something about his general attitude. \n\nRegimented theory contains no abstract objects other than sets. Many\nabstracta, however, can be defined in terms of sets: numbers,\nfunctions, and other mathematical entities being the most obvious.\nQuine excludes other alleged abstracta, such as properties,\npropositions (as distinct from sentences), and merely possible\nentities. The chief reason for this is that he finds the\nidentity-criteria for such entities unclear. He holds, quite generally,\nthat we should not postulate entities without having clear\nidentity-criteria for them. (This is the view that he sums up in the\nslogan “no entity without identity”; see (1969, 23) and\nelsewhere.) Doing so would threaten the clarity and definiteness which\nthe notion of identity brings to theory; local gains from postulating,\nsay, propositions are not worth this global loss. (For a contrary view\nabout properties, see Armstrong 1980.) \n\nRegimented theory also has no place for mental entities, most\nobviously minds, if those are taken to be distinct from physical\nentities. The qualification is important. Many mental entities can be\nadmitted as special cases of physical objects. Thus my act of thinking\nabout Fermat’s Last Theorem at a particular time can simply be\nidentified with my body during that period of time (see 1995, 87f.).\nThe things that we might want to say about my act of thinking (that it\nwas inspired, or stupid, or what have you) can simply be reconstrued as\npredicates true or false of physical objects. This is the view\nsometimes known as anomalous monism or as token-token identity theory,\nas distinct from type-type identity theory (see 1960, §54, and\nDavidson 1980). I may think of the theorem at many times, over the\nyears, and on each occasion that act is identified with the physical\nstate that I am in at the time. Token-token identity theory does not\nclaim that these physical states have anything in particular in common,\nstill less that all acts of thinking about the theorem have something\nin common. There is no claim that each act of thinking about the\ntheorem can be identified with, e.g. a repeatable pattern of the firing\nof brain cells. It is enough for Quine’s purposes that each\nparticular act of thinking can be identified with a physical object.\nThis ontological physicalism might seem almost trivial; Quine speaks of\nit as “[e]ffortless monism … form without substance”\n(1995, 85). (Note that this view excludes disembodied minds\nand mental entities. Quine thinks that is no loss at all. Note also\nthat it can be construed either as eliminating mental entities\nor simply as identifying them with physical objects. Quine\nprefers the latter phrasing but thinks there is no real difference\nhere; cf. 1960, 265.) \n\nOn the issue of the admissibility of predicates, Quine’s\nphysicalism is more complicated. (This is in keeping with his general\nidea that we can think of the predicates, rather than the ontology, as\n“where the metaphysical action is”; 1976, 504). The\nrequirement here is that the difference between a predicate’s\nbeing true of a given object and its being false of it should, in all\ncases, be a physical difference: “nothing happens in the world,\nnot the flutter of an eyelid, not the flicker of a thought, without\nsome redistribution of microphysical states…. physics can settle\nfor nothing less” (1981, 98). If a predicate such as\n“…is thinking about Fermat’s Last Theorem”\npicks out genuine events in the world then there is a physical\ndifference between its being true of a person and its not being true of\nthem: a fact of the matter. \n\nA difficulty in making sense of this is that the idea of a\nphysical fact is not definitively specifiable. To tie the idea\ntoo closely to current physics would rule out fundamental changes in\nthat subject; to leave it floating free might seem to allow anything at\nall to qualify. But clearly Quine does not mean just any subject that\nsomeone might call by the name “Physics”. He has in mind a\nsubject continuous with our physics, alike or superior in its coherence\nand in its explanatory power. (In particular, it would not have\n“an irreducibly psychological annex”: 1986a, 403f.). If\nphenomena occurred which could not be explained by any theory of that\nkind, then Quine’s physicalism would go by the board.  \n\nThe most controversial application of this view is to mental\nphenomena. Within that realm, Quine focuses on attributions of\npropositional attitudes, statements that so-and-so believes that\nsuch-and-such, or hopes that, or fears that, etc. (One reason for this\nfocus may be that his interest is primarily in human knowledge; another\nthat some other mental states, such as pain, can perhaps be accounted\nfor by identifying them with certain types of neurophysiological\nevents.) \n\nPropositional attitudes also raise a different kind of issue.\nAttributions of such attitudes violate extensionality. If Mary is the\nDean, still Tom’s believing that the Dean sings well is not the\nsame as his believing that Mary sings well, since her accession to the\nDeanship may be unknown to him. Quine escapes this sort of problem by\ntaking an attribution of belief to express a relation between the\nbeliever and a sentence, understood to be, in the usual case,\nin the language of the ascriber (not the language of the believer,\nwhere the languages differ). \n\nIt is worth noting the idea of another sense of belief-ascription\nwhich would not be vulnerable even prima facie problems of\nextensionality: so-called de re belief, as distinct from\nde dicto belief. In the 1950s Quine argued that there must be\nsuch a sense. In the late 1960s, however, he abandoned the idea, for\nlack of clear standards of when it is correct to ascribe a de\nre belief to someone. (See Quine, 1956 for a statement of the\ndistinction, and Quine, 1973 for retraction.) Other philosophers,\nhowever, continue to hold the idea. (See, for example, Kaplan 1968,\nKripke 1979.) \n\nConstruing attributions of belief as statements of attitudes towards\nsentences gives them a syntax and an ontology that Quine can accept.\nThat does not, however, show that the idiom “A believes\nthat p” satisfies his physicalistic criterion, i.e. that\nall statements of this form correspond to (physical) facts. The matter\nis complicated. Quine certainly accepts that most uses of this idiom\nare factual. The relevant facts are neurophysiological states of the\nperson concerned, and those states are causally connected with actions\nwhich the person performs, or would perform under certain\ncircumstances, and which we would count as manifestations of the\nbelief, or lack of belief. (Assenting or dissenting when asked is one\nsuch action, but only one among a myriad.) In cases where we have\nevidence for or against the ascription of a belief to someone, the\nevidence consists in behaviour and there are presumably\nneurophysiological states which explain the behaviour. Those states are\nnot in practice specifiable in neurophysiological terms. Nevertheless,\nthe person’s being in those states is the physical fact in which\nthe truth of the ascription consists. Even where there is no behaviour\nof the relevant kind, there may still be dispositions to behave in\nthose ways under certain unrealized circumstances. The dispositions are\nthe physical states in which the truth of the ascription consists. So\nin most cases where we ascribe belief, there is a fact of the matter\nwhich makes the ascription true or false. (More on dispositions a few\nparagraphs hence.) \n\nThe belief idiom, however, also lends itself to use in other cases,\nwhere there is no fact of the matter. These are not merely cases in\nwhich we have no evidence. They are cases in which no behavioural tests\nwhich we might have carried out would have supplied evidence, cases in\nwhich there simply is nothing in the subject’s neurophysiology,\nand hence nothing in their actual or potential behaviour, which would\ndecide the matter. Quine puts the point like this: “Some beliefs,\nperhaps belief in the essential nobility of man qua man, are…\nnot readily distinguishable from mere lip service, and in such cases\nthere is no fact of the matter…. But most attributions or\nconfessions of belief do make sense…. The states of belief,\nwhere real, are… states of nerves.” (1986a, 429) \n\nQuine explicitly acknowledges that we could not in practice manage\nwithout idioms of propositional attitude, and that most uses of such\nidioms are entirely unobjectionable. But such idioms allow the\nformation of sentences which do not correspond to facts of the matter.\nFor that reason, Quine excludes them from regimented theory; they are\nnot be used when we are concerned with “limning the true and\nultimate structure of reality” (1960, 221). (Some philosophers\nmight insist: ‘Either you accept the concept of belief or you\ndon’t’. Quine would not agree; see 1986e for closely\nrelated remarks about the idea of knowing who someone is.) \n\nA somewhat similar point can be made about subjunctive or\ncounterfactual conditionals. Some are factual, but the general\ncounterfactual idiom allows for the formation of sentences which are\nnot factual. Like propositional attitudes, counterfactual conditionals\nhave an important role in our practical lives. They are also closely\nconnected with dispositions which, as we have seen, play a central role\nin Quine’s account of language and how it is learnt. The\nconnection is easily seen: to call an object fragile is to say that it\nwould break if it were dropped onto a hard surface\nfrom a significant height. \n\nQuine does not accept the general counterfactual idiom, “if\nX were to happen then Y would happen”, as part\nof regimented theory. As in the case of belief, the unrestricted use of\nthis idiom allows us to form sentences whose truth-conditions are, at\nbest, unclear. A famous example is the pair, presumably alluding to the\nKorean war of the early 1950s: “If Caesar were in charge he would\nuse the atom bomb”; “If Caesar were in charge he would use\ncatapults” (see Quine, 1960, 222); they seem equally plausible\nbut they cannot both be true (for a response, see Lewis 1973). In\nsuch cases, we have no reason to think that some (physical) fact is\nbeing claimed. Many dispositions, however, are perfectly acceptable by\nQuinean standards. To call the glass fragile is to attribute to it a\nstructure which would lead its breaking under certain circumstances; the\nstructure is a physical state, even if we cannot in practice specify it\nin physical terms. \n\nQuine claims that the dispositions he relies on in his account of\nlanguage are like the case of fragility rather than the case of Caesar.\nThe disposition to assent to an observation sentence when receiving\ncertain stimulations is a physical state of the person concerned; in\nparticular, presumably, of his or her brain. The claim that a given\nperson has such a disposition is thus a claim about the state of a\nphysical object. It is, moreover, a claim that we can test, at least\nunder favourable conditions. There is no reason to exclude it from\nregimented theory. \n\nAnother idiom which Quine famously excludes from regimented theory\nis that of modality, statements that such-and-such must be the\ncase, or cannot be the case, and so on. Such idioms have been\nthe subject of much discussion on the part of Quine and (especially)\nhis critics; the discussion here will be very brief. Technically, there\nare similarities with the case of belief. There is prima facie\nviolation of extensionality which can, however, be avoided by taking\nnecessity to apply to sentences; some philosophers have claimed that\nthere is a de re sense of necessity which does not lead to\neven prima facie violations of extensionality. Quine allows\nthat modal terms have a legitimate ordinary language use\n(‘possible’ is sometimes used to mean something like: we\ncan’t rule it out; see 1966, ch. 10). But his attitude towards\nthe philosophical use of the idea of modality, dividing truths into the\nnecessary and the possible, is far less sympathetic than his attitude\ntowards belief; he is particularly unsympathetic towards the idea of\nde re necessity, which he sees as requiring\n“Aristotelian essentialism” (Quine, 1953, 155). \n\nWhat frames these critical points about necessity is that Quine\nholds that regimented theory, the best and most objective statement of\nour knowledge, simply has no need for that notion. The benefit of\nincluding such idioms in regimented theory is not worth the cost in\nunclarity that it would bring. \n\nTruth, in Quine’s view, is immanent, as opposed to\ntranscendent. In accord with his fundamental naturalism, he sees\njudgments of truth as made from within our theory of the world. For\nthis reason, he sympathizes with what is sometimes called\ndisquotational theory of truth: to say that a sentence is true is, in\neffect, to assert the sentence. Two qualifications must be made. First,\nthe disquotational view is not a definition of “is\ntrue”. It enables us to eliminate the predicate from contexts in\nwhich it is applied to a finite number of specific sentences, but not\nfrom contexts where it is applied to infinitely many. Contexts of the\nlatter kind are of particular importance to logical theory. We say, for\nexample, that a conjunction is true just in case both conjuncts are\ntrue; here “is true” cannot be eliminated. (Unless, indeed,\nwe ascend to a metalanguage and give a definition of truth for the\nobject language that we are concerned with, following Tarski 1933.)\nSecond, calling an eternal sentence true is in one way unlike asserting\nit. If we subsequently change our verdict on it we say that we used to\nbelieve it but now we don’t. We do not, however, say that it used\nto be true but now it isn’t; rather we say that it was never\ntrue. Quine, however, sees this as simply a point of usage, with no\nparticular philosophical implications. \n\nIn this section we take up two ideas much discussed by commentators.\nNeither is essential to Quine’s overall philosophy, although in\neach case, but especially in the case of indeterminacy, the opposite\nclaim has been made. (See Ebbs, 1997; for a defense of the position\ntaken here, see Hylton, 2007.) \n\nThe basic idea of underdetermination is that two or more rival\ntheories might have all the same observational consequences, and thus\nbe empirically equivalent. Theory would thus be underdetermined by\nobservation. This might be held to call realism into question (as in\nvan Frassen 1980). Quine finds underdetermination harder to make sense\nof than might appear and, in any case, does not see a threat to\nrealism. \n\nIn Quine’s idealized schematization of the relation between\ntheory and evidence, evidence for theory consists of observation\ncategoricals. (These latter can, in turn, be tested by observing or\ncontriving situations in which relevant observation sentences are\ntrue.) The case which most obviously poses a potential threat to\nrealism is that of a final global theory, a perfected and completed\nversion of our own. What if there are two or more such theories,\nequally simple, each of which implies all true observation\ncategoricals? (Note that the theory will not be implied by all\nthe true observation categoricals; apart from other considerations,\nsome sentences of the theory will essentially contain terms which do\nnot occur in observation categoricals.) \n\nQuine is often thought to accept underdetermination. But in fact he\nholds that there is considerable difficulty in making non-trivial sense\nof the doctrine. He identifies theories with sets of sentences, not\nwith sets of sentence-meanings (propositions). So we can quite\ntrivially obtain an empirically equivalent alternative to any theory:\nsimply spell one of the theoretical terms differently at every\noccurrence. Strictly speaking, the result is a different set of\nsentences which implies all the same observation categoricals (1975a,\n319). The difference from the original theory, however, is merely\northographic; this possibility is clearly not of any philosophical\nsignificance. \n\nA closely related point can be made in terms of translation.\nTranslation of observation categoricals is quite unproblematic in\nprinciple. So we can count two theories as empirically equivalent not\nmerely if they imply the same observation categoricals but also if they\nimply intertranslateable observation categoricals. So classical physics\nas formulated in English (say) would, by this criterion, count as\nempirically equivalent to classical physics as formulated in German,\nyet the two formulations are, strictly speaking, different theories.\nQuite generally, any theory is empirically equivalent to its\ntranslation into any other language. But this fact is also not of any\ngreat philosophical significance, and certainly poses no threat to\nrealism. \n\nIn order to threaten realism, a version of underdetermination would\nthus have to assert that our postulated complete global theory of the\nworld has empirically equivalent alternatives and that no translation\nfrom one theory to the other is possible. Since the predicates of the\ntheory are its only non-logical vocabulary, this is equivalent to\nsaying that we cannot obtain one from the other by reconstruing the\npredicates of the theory. Quine comments: “This, for me, is an\nopen question.” (1975a, 327). Much of his subsequent discussion\nof underdetermination takes place in terms of the weaker idea that our\ntheory might have empirically equivalent alternatives and that\n“we would see no way of reconciling [them] by\nreconstrual of predicates” (loc. cit, emphasis added;\ncf. also 1990a, 97). \n\nIf some version of underdetermination were true, how should we\nrespond? This is an issue on which Quine has not merely changed his\nmind but vacillated, going back and forth between what he calls the\n“sectarian” and the “ecumenical” responses. The\nsectarian response is to say that we should not let the existence of\nthe alternative in any way affect our attitude towards our own theory:\nwe should continue to take it seriously, as uniquely telling us the\ntruth about the world. (We are assuming that the two theories possess\nall theoretical virtues to equal degree; clearly Quine would say that\nif one theory were superior in some way then we would have reason to\nadopt it.) The ecumenical response, by contrast, counts both theories\nas true. In almost his last word on the subject he suggests that there\nmay be little at stake since the “fantasy of irresolubly rival\nsystems of the world” takes us “out beyond where linguistic\nusage has been crystallized by use” (1990a, 100f). \n\nQuine can afford to vacillate because, in his view, nothing very\nmuch turns on the issue. In particular, he never holds that\nunderdetermination, in any version, would threaten realism; at no time\ndoes he suggest that it casts doubt on the truth of our theory. That is\nnot what is in question between the sectarian and the ecumenical\npositions; all that is in question is whether the alternative theory\nshould also be counted as true. Nor is this surprising. The\nterms in which underdetermination is stated, such as observation\ncategoricals, are part of our theory, as would be the demonstration\nthat another theory was empirically equivalent. The point here is the\nnaturalism which we have emphasized throughout. Nothing in our\nepistemology pronounces on the status of theory from an independent\nstandpoint; to the contrary: it presupposes the truth of our theory.\nThis central idea is not cast in doubt by underdetermination. (See\nSevero 2008; for criticism, see Moore 2015 and for a rejoinder to Moore\nsee Kemp 2016.) \n\nThe general claim of the indeterminacy of translation is that there\nmight be different ways of translating a language which are equally\ncorrect but which are not mere stylistic variants. The claim includes\nwhat one might think of as the limiting case of translation, that in\nwhich a given language is ‘translated’ into itself. \n\nSome philosophers hold that the idea of indeterminacy is absurd, or\nthat it amounts to an extreme form of scepticism about whether we ever\nunderstand one another, or whether correct translation is possible at\nall. (See for example Searle, 1987; for a reply, see Føllesdal,\n1990.) It is not hard to see how such opinions arise. One picture of\ncommunication is like this: you have an idea, a determinate meaning, in\nyour mind and convey it to me by your utterance. To those who have that\npicture, indeterminacy threatens the whole idea of communication, for\nit suggests that the conveying is always vulnerable to drastic\nfailure. In the case of translation, the analogous view is that\nsynonymy, or sameness of meaning, is the criterion of correct\ntranslation; in that case, indeterminacy may appear as a denial that\ntranslation is possible at all. \n\nSuch views, however, take for granted a view of communication, or of\ntranslation, which is very far from Quine’s. For Quine, the\ncriterion of successful communication, whether or not it involves\ntranslation, is fluent interaction, verbal and nonverbal:\n“Success in communication is judged by smoothness of\nconversation, by frequent predictability of verbal and nonverbal\nreactions, and by coherence and plausibility of native\ntestimony.” (1990a, 43) This is a third person or external view\nof language and communication, as required by Quine’s naturalism.\nFrom this point of view, talk of synonymy and of ideas in the mind is\nsimply a theoretical gloss which is (at best) in need of justification.\nQuine doubts that the gloss is justifiable; scepticism about the\ntheorizing, however, is not scepticism about the data. Smooth\ncommunication certainly occurs, sometimes in cases where different\nlanguages are involved. Quine says nothing that casts doubt on the idea\nthat successful translation (by his criterion) is possible; his claim,\nindeed, is that it may be possible in more than one way. \n\nAt this point we need to distinguish two kinds of indeterminacy.\nQuine introduces the general idea of indeterminacy, in Chapter Two of\n(1960), without explicitly distinguishing the two, but subsequently\ncomes to treat them quite differently. The first is indeterminacy\nof reference: some sentences can be translated in more than one\nway, and the various versions differ in the reference that they\nattribute to parts of the sentence, but not in the overall net import\nthat they attribute to the sentence as a whole. (Quine uses the terms\n“ontological relativity” and “inscrutability of\nreference”, as well as “indeterminacy of reference”.\nSome philosophers have sought to distinguish these doctrines, but in\nlater work Quine makes it clear that he uses the terms simply as\ndifferent names for the same thing. See Ricketts 2011, Roth, 1986, and\nQuine 1986d.) To use an example which has become famous, a given\nsentence might be translated as “There’s a rabbit” or\nas “Rabbithood is manifesting itself there” or as\n“There are undetached rabbit parts”, or in other ways\nlimited only by one’s ingenuity. All that is needed is what Quine\ncalls a proxy function, which maps each object onto another object and\neach predicate onto one which is true of a given proxy-object if and\nonly if the original predicate is true of the original object. For\nterms referring to physical objects, he suggests, we can take the\nproxy-function to map each object onto its space-time complement. The\nchange to the translation of singular terms and the change to the\ntranslation of predicates cancel out, leaving the overall significance\nof the sentence unchanged. The claim of indeterminacy of reference is\nnot in any way a claim about what goes on in the language-user’s\nmind (pace Wright 1997). (Note that it will not help to ask\nthe person we are translating whether she means to refer to the family\ndog or to its space-time complement: her answer is subject to the same\nindeterminacy.) \n\nIndeterminacy of reference is akin to a view of theoretical entities\nput forward by Ramsey: that there is no more to such an entity than the\nrole that it plays in the structure of the relevant theory (see Ramsey,\n1931). For Quine, however, the point holds for all objects, since he\n“see[s] all objects as theoretical… . Even our most\nprimordial objects, bodies, are already theoretical” (1981, 20).\nQuine holds, moreover, that considerations akin to those of the\nprevious paragraph amount to a “trivial proof” of\nindeterminacy of reference (1986c, 728). \n\nThe second kind of indeterminacy, which Quine sometimes refers to as\nholophrastic indeterminacy, is another matter. Here the claim\nis that there is more than one correct method of translating sentences\nwhere the two translations of a given sentence differ not merely in the\nmeanings attributed to the sub-sentential parts of speech but also in\nthe net import of the whole sentence. (Hence the two translations would\nexpress different propositions, in the abstract sense, or different\nFregean Gedanke; Quine claims that undermining these ideas was\npart of his motivation in developing the doctrine; see 1990d.) This\nclaim involves the whole language, so there are no examples, except\nperhaps of an exceedingly artificial kind. There is also nothing\nresembling a proof; in some late works, indeed, Quine refers to it as a\n“conjecture” (1986c, 728). At some earlier points, he seems\nto think that sufficiently clear-headed reflection on what goes into\ntranslation will suffice to make the idea at least plausible. All that\ncan be required of a method of translation is that it enables us to get\nalong with the speakers of the other language: why should there\nnot be more than one way to do it? \n\nArguments have been offered for holophrastic indeterminacy based on\nthe idea of underdetermination of theory by evidence (by Quine\nhimself in his 1970) . Perhaps there is determinate translation of\nobservation sentences, and thus of observation categoricals. Still, if\neach two distinct theories is compatible with all observational truths,\nsurely we could plausibly attribute either theory to the speaker of the\nother language. The weakness of this kind of argument is that\ntranslation must presumably preserve more than links between sentences\nand stimulations, as captured by observation sentences; it must also\npreserve links among sentences, links which make it more or less likely\nthat a person who accepts a given sentence will also accept another.\nCould there be methods of translation which preserved both kinds of\nlinks but nevertheless yielded different results? Quine’s term\n“conjecture” seems apt. \n\nGiven the interpretation advanced in section 3, above, indeterminacy\nis not crucial for Quine’s rejection of the sort of use that\nCarnap makes of the idea of analyticity. He has other arguments on that\nscore, as we saw. More generally, on the interpretation advanced here,\nindeterminacy is not a crucial part of Quine’s overall view. His\ncoming to speak of it as conjectural, while not questioning other parts\nof his philosophy, suggests that he would accept this. If we were sure\nthat translation is determinate, we could perhaps use the idea to\ndefine a notion of synonymy. (Agnosticism here favours the contrary\nposition.) And, as Quine has indicated, we could then define the\nmeaning of an expression as the set of synonymous expressions. Such a\nnotion of meaning might make some difference. It might, for example,\nprovide a criterion of identity which enabled us to accept beliefs as\nentities. It would not, however, play the most important roles in which\nphilosophers have cast the idea of meaning. In particular, it would not\nplay a role in the explanation of how we understand our language, or of\nhow communication between persons takes place. \n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, many scientifically-oriented philosophers\ntended to assume some form of Logical Empiricism. One important aspect\nof Quine’s influence on the course of philosophy is that he\ncalled that view or nexus of views into question (see section 3,\nabove). Some of his criticisms are detailed and technical. His target,\nhowever, was not a technical detail but the fundamental idea of Logical\nEmpiricism, that there is a distinction between analytic truths and\nsynthetic truths which can account for a priori truth. After\nQuine’s work of the early 1950s, philosophers, even those who did\nnot accept his detailed arguments could no longer take it for granted\nthat some form of Logical Empiricism is correct. This was a very major\nchange among scientifically-oriented philosophers. \n\nQuine’s rejection of Logical Empiricism leads him to two\n(connected) views which have been extremely influential. First, he\nrejects the idea of a distinction between philosophy on the one hand\nand empirical science on the other hand. To the contrary: he sees\nphilosophy as essentially in the same line of work as science, but\nmostly concerned with more theoretical and abstract questions. This is\nan integral part of his naturalism. Second, his criticism of Carnap,\nand of the Principle of Tolerance in particular, opens the way for\nsomething that might be called metaphysics: for very general\nreflections on the nature of the world, based on the best scientific\nknowledge that we have and on claims about how that knowledge might be\norganized so as to maximize its objectivity and clarity. \n\nBoth of these Quinean views, his naturalism and his acceptance of\nsomething like metaphysics, correspond to very important developments\nwithin analytic philosophy over the past half-century. His influence\nhas surely played a significant role here. (In the case of metaphysics,\nin particular, it is notable that two leading figures, Saul Kripke and\nDavid Lewis, were students of Quine’s.) For the most part,\nhowever, those Quinean doctrines have led to work to which Quine\nhimself would be strongly opposed. \n\nIn the case of naturalism, many philosophers have welcomed the idea\nthat they are free to use concepts and results drawn from empirical\nscience. Fewer have accepted that philosophy should also be constrained\nby scientific standards of clarity, of evidence, and of\nexplanatoriness. The result is that while views which claim to accept\nnaturalism are common, those which accept Quine’s standards of\nwhat counts as reputable naturalistic philosophy are not. \n\nThe case of metaphysics is similar but perhaps more extreme. Quine\naccepts that the philosopher is in a position to make very general\nclaims about the world (that there are sets but not properties, for\nexample). In his hands, such claims are answerable to the idea of a\ntotal system of our scientific knowledge, regimented so as to\nmaximize clarity and systematicity. Many philosophers have welcomed the\nfreedom to speculate about the nature of the world but have not\naccepted Quine’s constraints on the process. The result is a\nflourishing of metaphysics, often based on ordinary (unregimented)\nlanguage or on the alleged deliverances of ‘intuition’;\nmuch of this work would be anathema to Quine. (See Rosen 2014.) \n\nOn the one hand, then, Quine’s work has been extremely\ninfluential and has done much to shape the course of philosophy in the\nsecond-half of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first. On the\nother hand, much of the work directly or indirectly influenced by Quine\nis of a sort that he would have thought quite misguided.","contact.mail":"hylton@uic.edu","contact.domain":"uic.edu"},{"date.published":"2010-04-09","date.changed":"2019-02-14","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quine/","author1":"Peter Hylton","author1.info":"https://phil.uic.edu/philosophy/people/faculty/hylton","author2.info":"http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/humanities/staff/garykemp/","entry":"quine","body.text":"\n\n\n\nWillard Van Orman Quine (1908–2000) worked in theoretical philosophy\nand in logic. (In practical philosophy—ethics and political\nphilosophy—his contributions are negligible.) He is perhaps best\nknown for his arguments against Logical Empiricism (in particular,\nagainst its use of the analytic-synthetic distinction). This argument,\nhowever, should be seen as part of a comprehensive world-view which\nmakes no sharp distinction between philosophy and empirical science,\nand thus requires a wholesale reorientation of the subject.\n\n\nIn what follows, a very brief section on Quine’s life and\nphilosophical work will be followed by an overview, which will serve to\norient the reader. We shall not comment in any detail on Quine’s\nwork in pure logic or set theory (for Quine’s work on set theory,\nsee Forster 2006). The third section is devoted to Quine’s\narguments against the use that the Logical Empiricists made of the\nanalytic-synthetic distinction, and the view that he worked out to take\nits place. The subsequent three sections go systematically through\nQuine’s own views; the final section is on Quine’s place in\nthe history of philosophy.\n\n\n1908: born, Akron, Ohio, on June 25th. \n\n1926–30: attended Oberlin College, Ohio; B.A, major in Mathematics\nwith honors reading in mathematical philosophy. \n\n1930–32: attended Harvard University; Ph.D. in Philosophy,\ndissertation on Whitehead and Russell’s Principia\nMathematica. \n\n1932–33: held a Sheldon Traveling Fellowship and visited (most\nnotably) Vienna, Warsaw, and Prague (where Carnap was then\nteaching). \n\n1933–36: a Junior Fellow in Harvard’s newly-formed Society of\nFellows; worked chiefly on logic and set theory. \n\n1934: published A System of Logistic, a revised version of\nhis dissertation. \n\n1936–78: held teaching positions at Harvard, first as Faculty\nInstructor, then as Associate Professor (1941) and then as Professor\n(1948). \n\n1940: published Mathematical Logic. \n\n1942–45: U.S. Navy, working chiefly in Naval intelligence. \n\n1953: published From a Logical Point of View. \n\n1960: published Word and Object. \n\n1963: published Set Theory and its Logic. \n\n1966: published Ways of Paradox. \n\n1969: published Ontological Relativity and Other\nEssays. \n\n1974: published The Roots of Reference. \n\n1981: published Theories and Things. \n\n1990: published Pursuit of Truth. \n\n1995: published From Stimulus to Science. \n\n2000: died, Boston, Massachusetts, December 25t.h. \n\n(Note: for the sake of brevity, we have listed only Quine’s\nmost notable books, including collections of essays.)  \n\nQuine’s philosophical thought is remarkably consistent over\nthe course of his long working life. There are developments, of course,\nbut outright changes of mind are relatively rare and mostly on\nrelatively minor points. We can, for the most part, treat him as having\na single philosophical orientation, to which what he calls\n“naturalism” is fundamental. This is not to say that his\nnaturalism is self-conscious and explicit from the start; it is,\nrather, something that he became clearer about over the years. (For the\ndevelopment of Quine’s naturalism, see Verhaegh, 2018.) \n\nThe term “naturalism” has been understood in various\nways; we need to see what Quine’s naturalism comes to. At one\npoint, he describes naturalism as “the recognition that it is\nwithin science itself, and not in some prior philosophy, that reality\nis to be identified and described” (1981, 21). Two points\nare important to note about the idea of “science” here.\nFirst, it is less restrictive than it may seem. Quine certainly takes\nthe natural sciences, especially physics, as paradigmatic. As he says\nhimself, however, he uses the word “science” broadly; he\nexplicitly includes psychology, economics, sociology, and history (see\n1995, 49). Second, Quine does not see scientific knowledge as different\nin kind from our ordinary knowledge; he sees it, rather, as the result\nof attempts to improve our ordinary knowledge of the world:\n“Science is not a substitute for common sense but an extension of\nit.” (1957, 229). The scientist, he says, “is\nindistinguishable from the common man in his sense of evidence, except\nthat the scientist is more careful.” (1957, 233). We might add\nthat the scientist is more narrowly focused on issues of truth and\nobjectivity and, in the hope of contributing to these goals, clearer\nand more systematic. \n\nMany philosophers would no doubt accept that the methods and\ntechniques of science are the best way to find out about the world.\n(With or without the points just noted about the word\n“science”.) The distinctiveness of Quine’s naturalism\nbegins to emerge if we ask what justifies this naturalistic claim: what\nreason do we have to believe that the methods and techniques of science\nare the best way to find out about the world? Quine would insist that\nthis claim too must be based on natural science. (If this is\ncircular, he simply accepts the circularity.) This is the revolutionary\nstep: naturalism self-applied. There is no foundation for Quine’s\nnaturalism: it is not based on anything else. \n\nThe point here is that Quine denies that there is a\ndistinctively philosophical standpoint, which might, for example,\nallow philosophical reflection to prescribe standards to science as a\nwhole. He holds that all of our attempts at knowledge are subject to\nthose standards of evidence and justification which are most explicitly\ndisplayed, and most successfully implemented, in the natural sciences.\nThis applies to philosophy as well as to other branches of knowledge.\nThe epistemologist, therefore, reflects on science from within science;\nthere is no theory of knowledge distinct from science.\n“Epistemology”, Quine says, “…is contained in\nnatural science, as a chapter of psychology” (1969, 83). (For an\nalternative view of the relation of philosophy to science, based on\ndiscussion of the history of science, see Friedman, 1997.) \n\nIn Quine’s view, philosophers can, therefore, do no better\nthan to adopt the standpoint of the best available knowledge, i.e.\nscience, in some suitably broad sense. We adopt what he calls\n“the fundamental conceptual scheme of science and common\nsense” (1960, 276). Philosophers are thus to be constrained by\nscientific standards. In (1974) he puts it this way: “In our\naccount of how science might be acquired we do not try to justify\nscience by some prior and firmer philosophy, but neither are we to\nmaintain less than scientific standards. Evidence must regularly be\nsought in external objects, out where observers can jointly observe\nit….” (1974, 34f.) \n\nThe view sketched above has both positive and negative aspects. The\nlatter are better-known, and Quine is often thought of as a negative\nphilosopher, primarily concerned to criticize others. He casts doubt on\nterms which many philosophers take for granted. He does not dismiss\nsuch terms as meaningless, but simply as not meriting a place in\nserious science, or in the objective account of the world at which\nscience aims. A well-known and important example is his criticism of\nthe idea of meaning, in the sense of the meaning of a particular\nsentence or statement. Quine says: “Meaning… is a worthy\nobject of philosophical and scientific clarification and analysis,\nand… it is ill-suited for use as an instrument of philosophical\nand scientific clarification and analysis.” (1981, 185). The term\nis insufficiently clear, and putative explanations which employ it are\nin fact unexplanatory; by engendering the illusion of explanation they\ntend to impede the progress of science. So philosophers should not rely\non the term. He makes similar remarks about “thought”,\n“belief”, “experience”,\n“necessity”, and other terms which many philosophers assume\nare legitimate and available for philosophical use without themselves\nrequiring explanation and justification in other terms. (For an\nillustration of Quine’s attitude towards the term\n“meaning” as used by one such philosopher, see his reply to\nPagin in Orenstein and Kokato, 420f.) \n\nThis criticism of the scientific and philosophical use of certain\nordinary terms goes along with rejection of philosophical questions\nwhich make essential use of those terms. For example, many philosophers\nhold that there are important philosophical problems concerning\nknowledge: Do we really know anything at all? What exactly are the\nconditions on knowledge? (This latter question has seemed especially\npressing since Gettier, 1963.) Quine, by contrast, finds the word\n“knowledge” vague, and consequently rejects it for serious\nuse, saying that the word is ‘‘useful and unobjectionable\nin the vernacular where we acquiesce in vagueness, but unsuited to\ntechnical use because of lacking a precise boundary’’\n(1984, 295). Accordingly, many such questions formulated using the term\nmay simply be dismissed, even if it remains eminently useful for making\nrough sorts of claim, when we say as above that scientific knowledge is\nnot different in kind from our ordinary knowledge. \n\nAs we have just seen, Quine’s views issue in very general\ncriticism of much philosophy and indeed of the assumption that the term\n“knowledge” marks a clear subject of inquiry. It is,\nnevertheless, a mistake to think of him as primarily a critical or\nnegative thinker: his criticisms rely on his positive doctrine, which\nin turn generates further questions. As for whether those are genuinely\nphilosophical questions, it is implicit in what has already\nbeen said that he would not acknowledge such a category as the\n‘genuinely philosophical’ if that is meant to\nimply questions which are different in kind from those of science. But\ncertainly he accepts that some questions are sufficiently general,\nabstract, and remote from observation, that they may be classified as\nphilosophical. At times he assimilates the questions with which he is\nconcerned to those which have traditionally occupied philosophers.\nEpistemology—the theory of knowledge—is a clear example,\nalthough Quine’s approach to that subject is quite different from\nthat of many philosophers. \n\nIn some places, Quine approaches epistemology through the problem of\nscepticism about the external world. But he has no room for the kind of\nscepticism which asks the following kind of question: even if our\nalleged knowledge, our science, is completely successful in its\npredictions, how do we know that it tells us the way the world really\nis? (See Alston, 1993.) Thus Quine says:\n \n\nThis dismissal of one kind of scepticism is an example of\nQuine’s naturalism, and indicates how he understands that\nidea.  \n\nThere is, however, a way of understanding the sceptical question\nwhich Quine takes seriously. Philosophers have been concerned with the\ngap between what is given in experience and the knowledge that we take\nourselves to have. Quine invokes gestalt psychology and argues that the\nsimple sensory ideas which Berkeley and Hume had claimed were given by\nthe senses are not in fact given, that we see things in\nthree-dimensions, for example, instead of having to infer the third. He\ndoes not, however, conclude that there is no problem at all here.\nRather, he says, “the problem was real but wrongly viewed”\n(1974, 2). Epistemology, as he sees it, is here “confronting a\nchallenge to natural science that arises from within natural\nscience.” (loc. cit.). What is the challenge? It starts\nwith what Quine takes to be “a finding of natural science\nitself… that our information about the world comes only through\nimpacts on our sensory receptors” (1990a, 19). The sceptical\nchallenge is then: “How… could one hope to find out about\nthat external world from such meager traces? In short, if our science\nwere true, how could we know it?” (1974, 2). \n\nScepticism, understood in this fashion, is a challenge to\nQuine’s form of naturalism. It questions whether our knowledge\ncan be accounted for in terms which are, by Quine’s standards,\npurely naturalistic. Quine’s response is thus to sketch an\nausterely naturalistic account of how our knowledge, and the cognitive\nlanguage in which that knowledge is embodied, arises, or might arise.\nThis project, as he sees it, is essential to the defence of his\nnaturalistic world-view. (Section 4. will go into more detail about the\nproject.)  \n\nWhen Quine asks: “How… could one hope to find out about\nthat external world from such meager traces?” this is not a\nrhetorical question. It is, rather, a serious question, to be answered\nby deploying the full resources of our knowledge; it is a scientific\nquestion. Quine recognizes that the question, thus construed, is not\nexactly what earlier epistemologists had in mind, but argues that the\nchange is justified: “A far cry, this, from the old epistemology.\nYet it is no gratuitous change of subject matter, but an enlightened\npersistence rather in the original epistemological problem.”\n(1974, 3). \n\nThe defence and articulation of Quine’s naturalism requires\nQuinean epistemology, an analogue of traditional epistemology but\ncarried out as a scientific enterprise. It also requires that he set\nout, in outline, what is to be included in a naturalistic account of\nthe world; in other words, it requires an account of the world, a least\nin broad outline. Among other things, this account constrains his\nepistemology, since that is to be a naturalistic account of\nknowledge. \n\nIn what follows, we shall sometimes speak of Quine’s account\nof the world as his “metaphysics”, but it is metaphysics\nnaturalized: it is not carried out a priori, or by reflection\non the nature of Being quâ Being, or anything of that\nsort. (Quine himself does not much use the word\n“metaphysics”. He puts forward views on metaphysical\ntopics—such as ontology, time, and abstract objects—but\nwithin the confines of his naturalism.) \n\nQuine approaches his naturalistic analogue of metaphysics through\nthe idea of regimented theory. Regimented theory is our overall\nscience, the sum total of our best and most objective knowledge about\nthe world, reformulated in the clearest and simplest form. Quine sees\nthis kind of reformulating as of a piece with ordinary scientific\nendeavours, but carried further than working scientists are likely to\nhave reason to do. He discusses the distorting effect which language is\nlikely to have on our view of the world and comments: \nRegimented theory is, of course, an idealization. It is not a\ncomplete and finished object, available for us to examine.\nQuine’s reflections on it might be considered as something like a\nthought-experiment: if we were to set about assembling our total theory\nof the world and recasting it in the best form, what would it look\nlike? Since the enterprise is not in fact going to be carried out all\nthe way we are not going to get a detailed answer. But on some\nimportant general issues, Quine holds, we can get answers. In\nparticular, he argues that the framework of regimented theory is\nfirst-order logic with identity (and so that theory is extensional);\nthat the variables of this theory range only over physical objects and\nsets; and that the predicates of the theory, the only non-logical\nvocabulary, are physicalistic, in his somewhat complicated sense. (See\nsection 5, below.) Although this is not traditional a priori\nmetaphysics, we should not underestimate the ambition of the project.\nHe says of his regimented theory that “all traits of reality\nworthy of the name can be set down in an idiom of this austere form if\nin any idiom” (1960, 228) and speaks of “limning the true\nand ultimate structure of reality” (1960, 221). The claim\nthat the variables of regimented theory range only over physical\nobjects and sets is, as far as he is concerned, the claim that only\nphysical objects and sets really exist. \n\nThe philosophers who most influenced Quine were the Logical\nEmpiricists (also known as Logical Positivists), especially Rudolf\nCarnap. The distinction between analytic truths and synthetic truths\nplays a crucial role in their philosophy. Analytic truths might be\ncharacterized as those true solely in virtue of the meanings of the\nwords they contain, or of the rules of the language, or something of\nthe sort. Synthetic truths, by contrast, state matters of\nextra-linguistic fact, and are known by experience. The Logical\nEmpiricists accounted for truths which do not seem to be answerable to\nexperience, most obviously the truths of logic and mathematics, by\nsaying that they are analytic. This position was very widely held by\nthe 1940s. Quine, however, famously casts doubt on\nanalytic-synthetic distinction, and rejects the use made of it by\nthe Logical Empiricists and other philosophers from the 1930s on.\n(Notable among the others is C. I. Lewis, first a teacher and then a\ncolleague of Quine; his influence on Quine has perhaps been\nunderestimated. See Baldwin 2013, Ben-Menahem 2016, and Sinclair\n2016.) \n\nThe issues here are complex, and the argument takes many twists and\nturns. The aim of this section is to give an account of Quine’s\nmature view, and of the strongest arguments that he has for it. \n\nCarnap holds that the role of philosophy is to analyze and clarify\nthe language of science, and to formulate and recommend alternative\nlanguages. After 1932, he holds that there are languages which differ\nin expressive power, not merely as notational variants. The difference\nbetween intuitionistic logic and classical logic is an important\nexample here, as is the difference between the language of Newtonian\nmechanics and the language of relativistic mechanics. (Earlier, he\nsays, he had ‘overlooked the fact that there is a multiplicity of\npossible languages’, Carnap 1934, 245; cf. also 322 of the same\nwork.) Within a given language, there may be only one correct theory on\na given subject. But the choice of a language is in that respect unlike\nthe choice of a theory. In deciding which theory is correct, we will\nappeal to observations but also to the rules of the language; no such\nappeal is possible when we are choosing a language, for in this case it\nis the rules themselves that we are choosing. So Carnap holds that\nthere is no one correct language. This idea has become known\nas the Principle of Tolerance; from the 1930s on, it is fundamental to\nCarnap’s view of what philosophy is and how it differs from\nscience. (That there is such a difference is a point which Carnap never\nquestions.) Because there is no one correct language, it is no part of\nthe philosopher’s job to prescribe this or that language, merely\nto analyze, to clarify, and to suggest alternatives. \n\nThe Principle of Tolerance requires the analytic-synthetic\ndistinction. It requires that we can, in all cases, distinguish between\ntheoretical changes which involve a change of meaning, and hence,\nstrictly speaking, a change of language, and those which do not. The\nformer kind of change involves analytic sentences, and is a matter for\nTolerance; the latter involves only synthetic sentences, and Tolerance\ndoes not apply. The use of the Principle of Tolerance thus presupposes\na clear distinction between the analytic sentences of the language and\nits synthetic sentences. \n\nAt least as Quine sees the matter, the use of the Principle of\nTolerance puts analytic sentences on an entirely different\nepistemological footing from synthetic sentences. Synthetic sentences\nare answerable to evidence; analytic sentences are a matter of the\nchoice of language, which does not require theoretical justification.\nQuine, however, rejects the idea that there is such an epistemological\ndifference. Even if we can distinguish the analytic sentences from the\nsynthetic sentences, we may still have reasons to reject an analytic\nsentence. And those reasons may be of the same kind that lead us to\nreject synthetic sentences. This point is hard to see if one focuses on\nexamples such as “All bachelors are unmarried”. The matter\nis otherwise if one considers examples such as “Force equals mass\ntimes acceleration”. (See Putnam, 1962.) A change of mind\nabout an analytic sentence would be a change in the language. Still, we\nmight have reasons to make such a change, reasons that are of the same\nsort that lead us to make revisions to synthetic sentences. In that\ncase, we have no more reason to apply Tolerance in the one kind of case\nthan in the other. \n\nThis is the view that Quine argues for. On the one hand, he\nemphasizes the point (which Carnap largely accepts) that choice of\nlanguage is not theoretically neutral: some choices will make for a\nbetter theory than others. On the other hand, he argues that\n‘pragmatic’ factors, such as simplicity, which Carnap\nhad accepted as playing a role in choice of language, also play a role\nin the choice of a theory within a language. Hence, he claims, the two\nsorts of choice are on the same epistemological footing, and the\nPrinciple of Tolerance is unjustified. \n\nQuine’s argument for this position relies on holism.\nThis is the claim that most of our sentences do not have implications\nfor experience when they are taken one-by-one, each in isolation from\nthe others. What has experiential implication is, in most cases, not an\nindividual sentence but a larger chunk of theory. Holism is not a very\ncontroversial doctrine. (Carnap accepts it; see Carnap, 1934, 318.)\nQuine claims that holism shows that most of our sentences are not\njustified by the relation of the individual sentence, considered in\nisolation, to experience. Almost always, what matters is the relation\nto experience of some larger chunk of theory (in principle, although\nperhaps never in practice, of the theory as a whole). This means that\nin principle the correctness of a given claim is almost never settled\nsimply by looking at the empirical evidence for that claim alone. Other\nfactors will play a role, in particular the way in which accepting the\ngiven claim would contribute to the efficacy and simplicity of the\ntheory as a whole. But these are precisely the ‘pragmatic\nfactors’ which Carnap thought played a role in the choice of\nlanguage. In arguing that such factors play a role throughout our\nknowledge, Quine accepts ‘a more thorough pragmatism’\n(1951, 46) which puts Carnap’s external changes on the same\nepistemological footing as his internal changes. (Quine’s early\naccount of these matters is extremely sketchy. For elaboration, see\nQuine 1991 and 1996; for criticism of the sketchy account, see Sober\n2000.) \n\nIf logic, mathematics, and other putatively a priori parts\nof our knowledge, are not to be explained by analyticity, how are they\nto be accounted for? Holism, which is central to Quine’s argument\nagainst Carnap, also provides him with an alternative position. It\nseems as if logic and mathematics have a special status because they\nare independent of experience. They appear to be necessary and not\nsusceptible of refutation by what future experience brings; they appear\nto be a priori because we know them independent of experience.\nCarnap sought to explain these appearances by appealing to the idea\nthat accepting an analytic sentence of a given language goes with\nspeaking that language, and to the Principle of Tolerance. Since choice\nof language is not justified by experience, the truth of the analytic\nsentences of a given language is not answerable to experience. \n\nHow is Quine to explain the apparent necessity and a priori\nstatus of some truths without appeal to the Principle of Tolerance?\nQuine’s holism is the view that almost none of our knowledge is\ndirectly answerable to experience. (The exceptions are what he\ncalls ‘observation sentences’; see 4.2, below.) In almost\nall cases the relation is indirect: a given sentence is only answerable\nto experience if a body of theory is presupposed. (When we say that a\ngiven observation confirms or refutes a given theoretical claim, we are\ntacitly presupposing other theoretical knowledge.) This is most easily\nseen if we consider a highly theoretical sentence, but in Quine’s\nview it holds, of almost all our sentences. The reason to accept a\nsentence is its contribution to the success of theory as a whole as an\nefficient and simple method of dealing with and predicting experience;\nin principle, this means the success of our theory as a whole, the\nwhole body of sentences that we accept, in dealing with experience as a\nwhole. \n\nFor many of our sentences, this strong statement of holism holds\nonly in principle. In practice, we may have a good idea what\nexperiences would lead us to change our minds about a given sentence,\nand what further changes in theory would follow. Elementary arithmetic\n(to take that as an example) is different because it is involved in\nalmost every part of systematic knowledge. (In Quine’s well-known\nmetaphor, it stands near the centre of the ‘web of\nbelief’.) Abandoning it would mean abandoning our whole system of\nknowledge, and replacing it with an alternative which we have not even\nbegun to envisage. Nothing in principle rules out the possibility that\nthe course of experience will be such that our present system of\nknowledge becomes wholly useless, and that in constructing a new one we\nfind that arithmetic is of no use. But this is a purely abstract\npossibility, certainly not something we can imagine in any detail. So\nthe idea that we might reject arithmetic is likewise unimaginable;\nhence the truths of arithmetic appear to be necessary. \n\nFor similar reasons, arithmetic appears to be a priori. No\nparticular experience confirms ‘2 + 2 = 4’. (Quine is not\nadvancing what Frege derided as a ‘gingerbread and pebble’\naccount of arithmetic (Frege 1884, vii), in which the sentence is\njustified by our observations of cookies or stones.) Arithmetic is\nindependent of any particular experience, or any easily specifiable\nportion of experience; hence it appears as a priori. On\nQuine’s account, it rests on our experience as a whole, and the\nfact that the theory which best accounts for that experience makes\nessential use of arithmetic. \n\nAs we have just seen, even sentences which we cannot imagine\nrejecting might, in principle, be rejected. As Quine says: ‘no\nstatement is immune to revision’ (1951, 43; see Ebbs 2017, Ch.\n8). This claim of Quine’s has attracted a good deal of attention,\nand is sometimes thought to be shocking or even paradoxical. In the\ncontext of his debate with Carnap, however, it is not, by itself, at\nall surprising. For Carnap too, any sentence can be revised; he would\ninsist, however, that in the case of some sentences, the analytic ones,\na revision involves a change of language, and thus of the meaning of\nthe words used in the sentence. So the idea of meaning, and sameness of\nmeaning, occupies a crucial role in the debate over analyticity. \n\nQuine’s initial arguments against the analytic-synthetic\ndistinction seek to cast doubt on the idea that there is a notion of\nmeaning which is clear enough to use in defining a notion of\nanalyticity. He explores various proposals and finds them wanting. (See\nespecially Quine 1951.) Here too a crucial role is played by holism.\nOne apparently clear conception of meaning is that the meaning of a\nsentence is given by the experiences which would confirm it; holism,\nhowever, implies that the idea of confirmation does not apply to\nindividual sentences, considered in isolation from the theories of\nwhich they are parts. (For criticism see Fodor and Lepore 1992; for a\ncounter to Fodor and Lepore see Heal 1994; for later Quine on holism\nsee his 1991.) \n\nQuine’s scepticism about the idea of meaning is much\ncriticized. We will mention two criticisms. First, what standards of\nclarity is he employing, when he says that the notion of analyticity is\ninsufficiently clear? The answer, not explicit in (Quine, 1951), is\nthat the standards are those indicated by our discussion in the\nprevious section; Quine is asking for an explanation which is\nacceptable by his naturalistic standards (see Lugg 2012). Such an\nexplanation would not presuppose an idea of meaning, and would use such\nideas as definition or convention only in ways which are justified by\nthe literal sense of those terms. Second, some responses to\nQuine’s position here argue that it has obviously absurd\nconsequences, such as that meaningful discourse would be impossible or\nthat we could not understand our language. (See, for example, Grice and\nStrawson, 1956.) But Quine’s scepticism about meanings\ndoes not lead to any scepticism about meaningfulness. If we\nthink of meaningfulness as a matter of having a meaning then\nwe may think that our words cannot be meaningful unless there are\nmeanings. But such a way of thinking is, Quine claims, quite\nmisleading. In (Quine 1953), he offers a rough and ready behavioural\naccount of meaningfulness; it is clear from the way the account\nproceeds that the success of something along those lines would be of no\nhelp at all in defining synonymy or analyticity. \n\nWe said above that Quine seeks ‘to cast doubt’ on the\nidea of meaning, and on the use of that idea to explain the distinction\nbetween those changes of doctrine which involve a change of meaning and\nthose which do not, and thus also to explain analyticity. One might\nread (Quine 1951) and get the impression that he is not merely casting\ndoubt but wholly rejecting these ideas. In later works, however, he\nhimself suggests a definition of analyticity. A sentence is analytic\nfor a given native speaker ‘if he learned the truth of the\nsentence by learning to use one or more of its words’ (Quine,\n1991, 270; see also Quine 1974, 78–80.) It is analytic without\nqualification if it is analytic for all native speakers. By this\ncriterion, some obvious truths, such as ‘Bachelors are\nunmarried’, will presumably count as analytic. If we think of the\nset of analytic sentences as closed under logical consequence, as Quine\nsuggests, then, he says, all first-order logical truths ‘would\nthen perhaps qualify as analytic’ (Quine, 1991, 270). Along\nwith this, he comes to accept that certain revisions of belief do\ninvolve a change of meaning, presumably in a sufficiently clear sense\nof meaning (Quine, 1991, 270). \n\nNow it might seem as if Quine completely withdraws his earlier\ncriticism of the analytic-synthetic distinction and thus, presumably,\nof Logical Empiricism as a whole. But in fact this is not so. One\nconsideration here is the scope of Quinean analyticity. The idea will\nperhaps (as Quine says) include first-order logic, but it will not\ninclude mathematics; on this count alone, it is clear that it will not\ndo what Carnap requires of the idea of analyticity. An even more\nimportant consideration is that Quine’s version of the\nanalytic-synthetic distinction is not an epistemological distinction.\nSome changes of doctrine involve changes of meaning, others do not. In\nQuine’s view, however, this does not mean that the two sorts of\nchange must have different epistemological bases. To the contrary: as\nwe saw in 3.1, Quine rejects the Principle of Tolerance and, with it,\nthe idea that a change of language takes place on a different kind of\nepistemological basis from a change of theory within a language. His\nacceptance of a limited conception of analyticity does not change this\npicture. As he says: “I recognize the notion of analyticity in\nits obvious and useful but epistemologically insignificant\napplications” (1991, 271; emphasis added). \n\nOn the interpretation advanced here, Quine’s rejection of the\nPrinciple of Tolerance is the deepest aspect of his disagreement with\nCarnap. Quine sees all our cognitive endeavours, whether they involve\nformulating a new language or making a small-scale theoretical change,\nas having the same very general aim of enabling us to deal with the\nworld better; all such endeavours have the same very general kind of\njustification, namely, as contributing to that end. In this picture,\nthere is no basis for Carnap’s insistence that philosophy is in\nprinciple different from science. Philosophy, as Quine sees it,\nhas no special vantage point, no special method, no special access to\ntruth. Here we have the crucial idea of Quine’s naturalism,\ndiscussed in the previous section. \n\nAs we saw in section 2, Quine takes the fundamental epistemological\nproblem to be that of showing how we come to have knowledge of the\nworld. He seeks an account which is naturalistic in his austere sense,\nand thus starts with the idea that we know about the world only from\nimpacts of various forms of energy on our sensory nerves (see 2.3,\nabove). How do we get from such impacts to something recognizable as\nknowledge of the world? In the words of the title of Quine’s last\nmonograph: how do we get from stimulus to science? \n\nThis question is central for Quine’s scientific naturalism in\ngeneral. An answer would show that that world-view can accommodate an\naccount of human knowledge. If no answer is available, that world-view\nis cast in doubt. For these purposes it is perhaps enough if Quine can\nsketch an account, compatible with his naturalistic view, of how we\nmight acquire the knowledge which we take ourselves to have,\nwhether or not it is correct in detail. (See Quine 1990c, 291.) \n\nQuine treats knowledge as embodied in language. Apart from other\nconsiderations, language-use is observable and thus subject to\nscientific inquiry. Quine’s concern with how we might acquire\nknowledge thus takes the form of a concern with how we might acquire\ncognitive language. But his interest here is in epistemology, rather\nthan in language for its own sake: “I am interested in the flow\nof evidence from the triggering of the senses to the pronouncements of\nscience…. It is these epistemological concerns, and not my\nincidental interest in linguistics, that motivate my\nspeculations.” (1990b, 3). \n\nMuch of Quine’s work in epistemology is thus a discussion of\nhow a child might acquire cognitive language. This genetic project may\nseem to be a long way from the traditional concerns of epistemology.\nQuine claims, however, that the project in fact affords us the best\nobtainable insight into the nature of the evidence for our theories,\nand into the relation between theory and evidence: “the\nevidential relation is virtually enacted, it would seem, in the\nlearning.” (1975b, 74–75). \n\nCentral to Quine’s naturalistic account of knowledge is the\nidea that all our knowledge is in some way based upon stimulations of\nour sensory nerves. For much of our knowledge, the relation is quite\nindirect. (This is one way of expressing holism; see 3.1, above.) Most\nsentences are not accepted because of a direct relation between the\ngiven sentence and stimulations of nerve endings; the connection goes\nvia other sentences, and may be quite indirect and remote. But\nthen there must presumably be some sentences which are directly related\nto stimulations. This is the role that observation sentences play in\nQuine’s thought. Acts of uttering such sentences, or of assenting\nto them when they are uttered by others, are shared responses to\nstimulation. (We shall enter some qualifications at the end of this\nsub-section.) \n\nObservation sentences are the starting point for our acquisition of\nknowledge, the child’s entry into cognitive language. They are\nalso the sentences which are evidentially basic. What fits them to play\nboth roles is that they are (largely) independent of other parts of our\nlanguage. Hence they can (largely) be mastered by a child otherwise\nwithout linguistic competence, and known without presupposing other\nparts of our theory. (The reason for the qualification will become\napparent at the end of this sub-section.) \n\nMany philosophers are content to take for granted the idea of an\nevidentially basic sentence. Quine, however, cannot take that attitude;\nhe needs to show how we get “from stimulus to science”. The\nfirst step is to show that we can give a purely naturalistic account of\nhow some linguistic utterances can be directly tied to the occurrence\nof stimulations of the sensory nerves---an account of observation\nsentences, more or less. Quine expends enormous labour on this\npoint. \n\nQuine considers acts of assenting to sentences (or dissenting; but\nwe shall mostly leave that as understood). He focuses, in particular,\non our dispositions to assent to sentences. (We will briefly\nconsider the idea of a disposition in the next section.) To be an\nobservation sentence, a sentence must fulfill two criteria, one\nindividualistic and one social. The individualistic criterion is that a\nsentence is an observation sentence for a given person if he or she is\ndisposed to assent to it when, and only when, he or she is undergoing\nappropriate sensory stimulations, regardless of her internal state\n(e.g. the ancillary information which he or she possesses).\n“It’s warm in here” presumably satisfies this\ncriterion; my willingness to assent to it perhaps depends only on which\nof my sensory nerves are stimulated at the given moment. \n“There’s milk in the refrigerator” presumably does\nnot; unless I am actually looking into the refrigerator at the time, my\nwillingness to assent to it depends not on what I am experiencing at\nthe time but on my internal state, what I remember. The social\ncriterion is that the individualistic criterion should hold across the\nlinguistic community as a whole. To specify this more precisely is\ntricky, and we shall postpone the matter for a few paragraphs. \n\nEven the individualistic criterion raises considerable complications\nand difficulties. We speak of a disposition to assent (or dissent) in\nresponse to a pattern of stimulation but this is not quite accurate.\nSuch a pattern, a complete list of which sensory nerves are firing, and\nin which order, will hardly ever repeat itself. So what we need is,\nrather, the idea of a correlation of a response with a type of\nstimulation\n pattern.[1]\nBut the relevant idea of a\ntype here is complicated. The physical resemblance of two stimulation\npatterns, what Quine calls receptual similarity, is\nnot enough to make them constitute events of the same type, in the\nrelevant sense; two such patterns may resemble each other very closely\nyet lead to quite different responses. (Two occasions on which I am\ndriving a car may be almost identical in terms of my stimulation\npatterns, except that on one occasion I see a red light and on the\nother I see a green light. As far as my response goes, that small\ndifference outweighs all the similarities.) What is wanted is a more\ncomplex notion which Quine calls perceptual similarity. Very\nroughly, two stimulation patterns count as similar (for an animal, at a\ntime) if they tend to lead to the same\n response.[2] \n\nWith the account of perceptual similarity in place, we can say what\nit is for a sentence to be observational for me: if I am disposed to\nassent to it on one occasion on which I have a certain neural intake,\nthen I will also be disposed to assent to it on any other occasion on\nwhich I have neural intake which is (sufficiently) perceptually similar\nfor me at that time. \n\nIt is worth emphasizing the fact that the definition of the key\nnotion of perceptual similarity is behavioural. It avoids any idea of\nexperience, of awareness, of what strikes the person (or other animal)\nas more similar to what. It is simply a matter of responses, and thus\nof behaviour. (Assent is also treated as behavior, as sound-making\npropensities; see 1975c pp. 87–88). This is in accord with\nQuine’s insistence on what he takes to be scientific standards of\nclarity and rigour. One consequence of it is that the notion cannot be\ninvoked to explain behaviour. Quine is under no illusions on\nthis score. (See 1975c, 87, where the point is explicit.) The\nbehavioural account does not explain our understanding of\nobservation sentences; explanation, if possible at all, comes at the\nneuro-physiological level. What the behavioural account does is to make\nclear exactly what behaviour constitutes that understanding and, hence,\nwhat the neuro-physiological account would have to explain. (It also\nshows that there is indeed something to be explained.) \n\nSo far we have only an account of what it is for a sentence to be an\nobservation sentence for a particular person. But our language is\nshared, as it must be if it is to enable us to communicate with one\nanother. So we need to generalize the criterion across the linguistic\ncommunity. One might at first think that the social criterion would be:\nif one person is disposed to assent to the sentence on any occasion on\nwhich he or she has a certain neural intake, then any other person\nhaving the same neural intake will also be disposed to assent to it.\nQuine gives essentially this account in (1960). As he quickly comes to\nsee, however, it is not tenable, for it assumes that we can make sense\nof the idea of “same neural intake” between different\npeople. But different people have different sensory nerves (and there\nis no reason to suppose that one person’s sensory nerves are\nhomologous to those of others; see Quine 1969, chapter 6). \n\nQuine returned to this problem on and off over the next thirty-five\nyears. His eventual solution is that a sentence only counts as an\nobservation sentence if an occasion which leads to my having neural\nintake which disposes me to assent to it also leads to your having\nneural intake which disposes you to assent to it. Here there is no\ncross-person identification of neural intake or cross-person standards\nof perceptual similarity. On this account, however, there can only be\nobservation sentences if our standards of perceptual similarity line up\nin the right way. Two occasions which produce in me neural intakes\nwhich are perceptually similar by my standards must also (often enough)\nproduce in you neural intakes which are perceptually similar by your\nstandards. Quine is happy enough with this assumption of mutual\nattunement and suggests that it can be explained along evolutionary\nlines (see 1996, 160f.). \n\nWe have been explaining the idea of our having shared responses to\nstimulation. For the most part, Quine assumes that assent to an\nobservation sentence simply is such a response. This assumption,\nhowever, cannot be quite correct. It may look for all the world as if\nthere were a rabbit in front of me, even though there is not. If I have\nno reason to be suspicious I will be disposed to assent to\n“Rabbit?”; if I know about the deception, however, I will\nnot be. So my disposition to assent does not, after all, depend solely\non my sensory stimulations at the time. It depends also on my internal\nstate, whether I know that in this case the rabbit-like appearance is\nmisleading. The difficulty arises because “There’s a\nrabbit” is corrigible, a feature which, on most accounts, it\nshares with just about every sentence other than those about the\nspeaker’s current experience. If a sentence is corrigible then\nthere will be circumstances in which it is false, even though those\ncircumstances produce stimulation patterns which would generally lead\nobservers to assent to it. But then some observers may know that the\ncircumstances are of this deceptive kind and not be disposed to assent,\nwhile others have no such knowledge and are disposed to assent. The\nmoral of this is that assent, even to observation sentences, is not a\nmere response to stimulation; the responder’s internal state\n(having ancillary knowledge, or not) may also play a role. \n\nQuine does not seem to have fully appreciated this point, though\nsome of his later discussions come close to doing so (see, in\nparticular, Quine 1996). It is not fatal to his general account; it\ncomplicates the story rather than requiring a radical change. There may\nbe no sentences—at least none that satisfy the social criterion\nfor observationality—which can be wholly mastered simply by\nacquiring appropriate dispositions to assent and dissent in response to\ncurrent stimulations. For some sentences, however, acquiring such\ndispositions comes close to mastering their use, because those\nsentences are almost always true in those cases where\nobservers receive sensory stimulations which dispose them to assent.\n(Clearly this will be a matter of degree.) So the acquisition of the\nrelevant dispositions, and partial mastery of the sentence, can be used\nas a basis on which the child can learn more of the language, and more\nabout the world. This further learning in turn allows the child to\nmodify her or his original disposition to assent and dissent merely in\nresponse to current stimulation. \n\nQuine’s treatment of more sophisticated parts of language is\nnotably sketchier and more speculative than his detailed discussion of\nobservation sentences. In part this may be because he holds that it is\nmost important to understand the very first step into cognitive\nlanguage, how such language is possible at all. It may also be that the\ndifficulty of getting a satisfactory account of observation sentences\nimpeded him. \n\nBeyond these points, however, there is, from a Quinean perspective,\na limit to how detailed an account we should expect to have of the\nacquisition of sophisticated cognitive language. Mastery of an\nobservation sentence corresponds (more or less) to a relatively\nstraightforward disposition: to assent when receiving a stimulation\npattern within a certain range. For most sentences, however, this is\nnot the case. What disposition must one have acquired in order to count\nas understanding a sentence such as “The economy is in\nrecession”? No doubt the disposition to assent in response to\nevidence is required, but what counts as evidence is almost unmanageably diffuse.\nIn such a case, the links between sensory stimulation (such as that\ninduced by the sight of words in a newspaper) and assent are\n“multifarious [and] not easily reconstructed even in\nconjecture” (1960, 11). A relatively clear-cut account, of the\nsort that Quine gives of observation sentences, is simply not\navailable. \n\nSo Quine does not offer any sort of detailed account of the\nacquisition cognitive language beyond the observation sentences. (For\ncomparison of Quine’s approach here with the very different\napproach of Chomsky, see Smith 2014.) Instead, he considers stages on\nthe way, forms of language which one might suppose could be easily\nacquired by a child who has mastered observation sentences and which\nmight provide steps leading to yet more advanced language. \n\nOne such step, which is emphasized in Quine’s later work, is\nthe mastery of what he calls observation categoricals (1981 p. 28)\nThese are sentences of the form “Whenever X [happens], Y\n[happens]”, where the schematic letters are to be replaced by\nobservation sentences. (E.g. “Whenever there’s smoke,\nthere’s fire.”) It is plausible to suppose that a child who\nhas learnt the observation sentences can come by a mastery of the\nrelevant observation categorical. Observation sentences are what Quine\ncalls occasion sentences, true on some occasions and false on others,\nwhereas observation categoricals are eternal sentences, true or false\nonce for all. Quine suggests that we can think of observation\ncategoricals as a plausible first step towards a general mastery of\neternal sentences, which make up our serious theoretical knowledge. \n\nAnother step of the same kind is what Quine calls eternal\npredications, subject-predicate sentences true or false once for all,\nsuch as “Fido is a dog”. Assuming the child has learnt each\nterm as an observation sentence, the sight of the dog will dispose him\nto assent to each. Quine speculates that the sound of the word\n“Fido” may have something of the same effect as the sight\nof the beast, inclining our learner to assent to “Dog” and\nthus to “Fido is a dog”. It is notable that there is a sort\nof use-mention confusion operating here, if Quine’s suggestion is\ncorrect. Language is learnt by confusion and “short leaps of\nanalogy” rather than by “continuous derivation”\n(1975b, 77f.); indeed a holistic language cannot be learnt without such\nleaps. \n\nA further advance, in Quine’s view, takes place when the child\ncomes to use similar sentences but with two general terms, such as\n“Dogs are animals”. Such a sentence, Quine remarks is\n‘‘really a universal categorical, ‘Every α is a\nβ’.’’ (1974, 66). This kind of sentence, can be\nrepresented using pronouns (“If something is a dog then it is an\nanimal”) or, more or less equivalently, using the logical device\nof quantifiers and variables. Such sentences have a particular\nimportance for Quine in connection with the idea of reference. Merely\nto be able to use a name, to be able to name Fido upon seeing him, for\nexample, is not yet to refer; one might simply be using the term as a\nresponse to the sight of the dog, hence as an observation sentence.\nReference, as Quine sees the matter, requires the capacity to\nreidentify the object over time and changing circumstances: if a dog is\nbarking then it—that very same dog—is hungry; hence the\nimportance of pronouns. \n\nQuine also has things to say on more familiar epistemological\nthemes. In some cases he indicates how they can be integrated into his\napproach; thus he suggests that we can (albeit unrealistically)\nschematize the testing of a scientific theory by thinking of ourselves\nas deriving observation categoricals which can then be directly tested\nagainst observation sentences. In other cases he is content to adopt\nmore or less unchanged the account given by earlier authors, as in his\nlist of the virtues of a theory (see 1990a, 20). Our account above has\nstressed the most novel parts of his epistemology. \n\nOne issue left unaddressed above is the question whether\nQuine’s naturalized version of epistemology is normative. Some\ncommentators have claimed that it is not, and that this is a serious\ndefect (see Kim, 1988). Others claim that naturalized epistemology is\nnormative (see Gregory, 2008). Quine himself has weighed in, saying\nthat critics ‘are wrong in protesting that the normative\nelement…goes by the board’ (Quine, 1990a, 19). He cites\nthe ‘finding of natural science…that our information about\nthe world comes only through impacts on our sensory receptors’\n(Quine, 1990a, 19) as being normative, ‘warning us against\ntelepaths and soothsayers’ (Quine, 1990a, 19). More generally,\nnaturalized epistemology is concerned with ‘the whole strategy of\nrational conjecture in the framing of scientific hypotheses’\n(Quine, 1990a, 20). \n\nNaturalized epistemology is thus certainly normative in this sense:\nit tells us that in drawing up scientific theories we should\nrely on the evidence of the senses rather than on soothsayers; that we\nshould aim at simple theories, and so on. In telling us these\nthings, however, it relies on what we already know: it deploys some\nparts of our science to guide attempts in other areas. It does not take\na normative attitude towards science as a whole, criticizing or\njustifying it by wholly external, non-scientific standards. That would\nrequire a wholly extra-scientific position, an idea which Quine\nderogates as ‘First Philosophy’ (e.g. Quine 1981, 67). The\nrejection of any such idea is one way of phrasing the naturalism he\nadvocates. \n\nQuine takes seriously the idea that “it is within science\nitself, and not in some prior philosophy, that reality is to be\nidentified and described” (1981, 21). It follows from this idea,\nas he construes it, that our best scientific theory of the world tells\nus as much as we know about reality. (Our best theory at given time\ntells us as much as we know at that time; no doubt our views will\nprogress.) So setting out the broad outlines of that theory is the\nQuinean version or analogue of metaphysics, though he does not much use\nthe word. This subject interacts with that of the last section:\nQuine’s account of the world both lays down the constraints\nwithin which an account of knowledge must proceed, and is, in outline,\nthe knowledge that must be accounted for. \n\n How does Quine think we should establish the sort of claims\nthat we are calling “metaphysical”? Some points are\nfamiliar from our discussion in section 2. First, we do not resort to\nany special kind of philosophical insight. Second, what matters is\nordinary knowledge as refined and improved upon: science. Third, we\nrely upon the idea of regimented theory, science formulated in a\nlanguage that is clarified and simplified “beyond what might\nreasonably be urged upon the practicing scientist” (1957, 235;\nsee 2.4, above). We rely upon ordinary usage where no better is to\nhand, but accept changes that are improvements (see 1960, 3). A further\npoint is that in striving for the clarity and simplicity of our theory\nwe must consider the whole theory; local gains may be offset by global\nlosses. It is thus to overall regimented theory that we look when we\nare “limning the true and ultimate structure of reality”\n(1960, 221). \n\nWhat is Quine’s justification for relying on the idea of\nregimented theory, rather than on our ordinary conceptual scheme? (Cf.\nStrawson, 1959, Introduction.) One part of the answer is that just as\nscience is in the same line of business as ordinary knowledge, but does\nit better, so regimented language is in the same business as ordinary\nlanguage, but does it better. Regimentation, that is to say, is not the\nimposition of a wholly foreign language; it is the adoption of a\nlanguage that maximizes scientific virtues already partially present in\nordinary speech—logical structure, reference, the ready\namenability to algorithmic methods. But another part of the answer is\nthe idea that “our ordinary conceptual scheme” does not\npick out anything definite enough to answer metaphysical questions.\nThus Quine says: “…a fenced ontology is just not implicit\nin ordinary language…. Ontological concern is not a correction\nof a lay thought and practice; it is foreign to the lay culture, though\nan outgrowth of it.” (1981, 9). \n\nRegimentation, in Quine’s view, involves paraphrase into\nlogical notation. Such paraphrase greatly clarifies and simplifies our\ntheory. Inferences which are a matter of logic will be revealed as\nsuch; where additional assumptions are required it will be explicit\njust what is needed. The logic which Quine takes as the structure of\nregimented theory is classical (bivalent) first-order logic with\nidentity. Bivalence is justified on the grounds of simplicity. It is\nnot that we have some independent insight into the nature of the world\nwhich shows us that every sentence of regimented theory is either true\nor false. It is, rather, that the simplicity that we gain from making\nthis assumption, justifies our using a bivalent language; the\nmetaphysical claim follows along. (This reversal of direction should\nremind us of Carnap. The difference is that Quine does not accept the\nPrinciple of Tolerance; see section 3, above.) \n\nQuine’s choice of first-order logic, rather than second-order\nlogic, has been more controversial than his adoption of bivalence. One\nreason he gives for the decision is that every formalization of\nsecond-order logic (unlike first-order logic) is incomplete, relative\nto the standard semantics. A further reason is that one purpose of the\ncanonical framework is to enable us to assess the ontology of a theory.\nFrom this point of view it is an advantage that first-order logic has\nno ontological presuppositions of its own. (By adopting that logic we\ndo commit ourselves to there being some object or other, but not to the\nexistence of any particular entity.) Here again there is a clear\ncontrast with second-order logic, which does have ontological\npresuppositions. Exactly what those presuppositions are is unclear, and\nhas been debated; for Quine, this unclarity is a further reason to\navoid the subject entirely. \n\nParaphrasing a theory into classical logic imposes extensionality on\nit: a predicate may be replaced by a co-extensive predicate without\nchange of truth-value of the containing sentence; likewise an embedded\nsentence by a sentence of the same\n truth-value.[3]\nExtensionality imposes quite\nsevere restrictions. It requires, for example, that attributions of\nbelief, and other propositional attitudes, be regimented into a form\nquite different from that which they may appear to have. (For this\nreason, the commitment to extensionality is quite controversial; see\nFøllesdal 1986 and Kaplan 1968, 1986.) So one might suppose that\nQuine accepts extensionality reluctantly, as the price to be paid for\nthe advantages of the use of logic in regimenting theory. Such is not\nhis attitude, however. To the contrary, he thinks of the clarity that\nextensionality brings as a great advantage, and of theories that lack\nit as not fully comprehensible: “I find extensionality necessary,\nindeed, though not sufficient, for my full understanding of a\ntheory.” (1995, 90f.) \n\nQuine’s regimented theory, then, is the sum total of our\nknowledge, the best that we have, reformulated so as to fit into the\nframework of first-order logic. The extra-logical vocabulary consists\nonly of predicates. All metaphysical questions can thus be boiled down\nto two: What objects do the variables range over? and: What sorts of\nprimitive predicates are to be admitted? \n\nTo the first of these questions Quine offers a straightforward\nanswer: his ontology consists of physical objects and sets. He counts\nas a physical object the matter occupying any portion of space-time,\nhowever scattered the portion and however miscellaneous the occupants;\nsuch an object need not be what he calls a “body”, such as\na person or a tree or a building (see 1981, 13). He briefly entertains\nthe idea that we could manage without postulating matter at all, simply\nusing sets of space-time points, where these are understood as sets of\nquadruples of real numbers, relative to some co-ordinate system---that\nis, an ontology of abstract objects only. He seems to see no knock-down\nargument against this but abandons it, perhaps because the gain is too\nsmall to justify the magnitude of the departure from our ordinary\nviews. That he is willing to consider such a view, and take it\nseriously, shows something about his general attitude. \n\nRegimented theory contains no abstract objects other than sets. Many\nabstracta, however, can be defined in terms of sets: numbers,\nfunctions, and other mathematical entities being the most obvious.\nQuine excludes other alleged abstracta, such as properties,\npropositions (as distinct from sentences), and merely possible\nentities. The chief reason for this is that he finds the\nidentity-criteria for such entities unclear. He holds, quite generally,\nthat we should not postulate entities without having clear\nidentity-criteria for them. (This is the view that he sums up in the\nslogan “no entity without identity”; see (1969, 23) and\nelsewhere.) Doing so would threaten the clarity and definiteness which\nthe notion of identity brings to theory; local gains from postulating,\nsay, propositions are not worth this global loss. (For a contrary view\nabout properties, see Armstrong 1980.) \n\nRegimented theory also has no place for mental entities, most\nobviously minds, if those are taken to be distinct from physical\nentities. The qualification is important. Many mental entities can be\nadmitted as special cases of physical objects. Thus my act of thinking\nabout Fermat’s Last Theorem at a particular time can simply be\nidentified with my body during that period of time (see 1995, 87f.).\nThe things that we might want to say about my act of thinking (that it\nwas inspired, or stupid, or what have you) can simply be reconstrued as\npredicates true or false of physical objects. This is the view\nsometimes known as anomalous monism or as token-token identity theory,\nas distinct from type-type identity theory (see 1960, §54, and\nDavidson 1980). I may think of the theorem at many times, over the\nyears, and on each occasion that act is identified with the physical\nstate that I am in at the time. Token-token identity theory does not\nclaim that these physical states have anything in particular in common,\nstill less that all acts of thinking about the theorem have something\nin common. There is no claim that each act of thinking about the\ntheorem can be identified with, e.g. a repeatable pattern of the firing\nof brain cells. It is enough for Quine’s purposes that each\nparticular act of thinking can be identified with a physical object.\nThis ontological physicalism might seem almost trivial; Quine speaks of\nit as “[e]ffortless monism … form without substance”\n(1995, 85). (Note that this view excludes disembodied minds\nand mental entities. Quine thinks that is no loss at all. Note also\nthat it can be construed either as eliminating mental entities\nor simply as identifying them with physical objects. Quine\nprefers the latter phrasing but thinks there is no real difference\nhere; cf. 1960, 265.) \n\nOn the issue of the admissibility of predicates, Quine’s\nphysicalism is more complicated. (This is in keeping with his general\nidea that we can think of the predicates, rather than the ontology, as\n“where the metaphysical action is”; 1976, 504). The\nrequirement here is that the difference between a predicate’s\nbeing true of a given object and its being false of it should, in all\ncases, be a physical difference: “nothing happens in the world,\nnot the flutter of an eyelid, not the flicker of a thought, without\nsome redistribution of microphysical states…. physics can settle\nfor nothing less” (1981, 98). If a predicate such as\n“…is thinking about Fermat’s Last Theorem”\npicks out genuine events in the world then there is a physical\ndifference between its being true of a person and its not being true of\nthem: a fact of the matter. \n\nA difficulty in making sense of this is that the idea of a\nphysical fact is not definitively specifiable. To tie the idea\ntoo closely to current physics would rule out fundamental changes in\nthat subject; to leave it floating free might seem to allow anything at\nall to qualify. But clearly Quine does not mean just any subject that\nsomeone might call by the name “Physics”. He has in mind a\nsubject continuous with our physics, alike or superior in its coherence\nand in its explanatory power. (In particular, it would not have\n“an irreducibly psychological annex”: 1986a, 403f.). If\nphenomena occurred which could not be explained by any theory of that\nkind, then Quine’s physicalism would go by the board.  \n\nThe most controversial application of this view is to mental\nphenomena. Within that realm, Quine focuses on attributions of\npropositional attitudes, statements that so-and-so believes that\nsuch-and-such, or hopes that, or fears that, etc. (One reason for this\nfocus may be that his interest is primarily in human knowledge; another\nthat some other mental states, such as pain, can perhaps be accounted\nfor by identifying them with certain types of neurophysiological\nevents.) \n\nPropositional attitudes also raise a different kind of issue.\nAttributions of such attitudes violate extensionality. If Mary is the\nDean, still Tom’s believing that the Dean sings well is not the\nsame as his believing that Mary sings well, since her accession to the\nDeanship may be unknown to him. Quine escapes this sort of problem by\ntaking an attribution of belief to express a relation between the\nbeliever and a sentence, understood to be, in the usual case,\nin the language of the ascriber (not the language of the believer,\nwhere the languages differ). \n\nIt is worth noting the idea of another sense of belief-ascription\nwhich would not be vulnerable even prima facie problems of\nextensionality: so-called de re belief, as distinct from\nde dicto belief. In the 1950s Quine argued that there must be\nsuch a sense. In the late 1960s, however, he abandoned the idea, for\nlack of clear standards of when it is correct to ascribe a de\nre belief to someone. (See Quine, 1956 for a statement of the\ndistinction, and Quine, 1973 for retraction.) Other philosophers,\nhowever, continue to hold the idea. (See, for example, Kaplan 1968,\nKripke 1979.) \n\nConstruing attributions of belief as statements of attitudes towards\nsentences gives them a syntax and an ontology that Quine can accept.\nThat does not, however, show that the idiom “A believes\nthat p” satisfies his physicalistic criterion, i.e. that\nall statements of this form correspond to (physical) facts. The matter\nis complicated. Quine certainly accepts that most uses of this idiom\nare factual. The relevant facts are neurophysiological states of the\nperson concerned, and those states are causally connected with actions\nwhich the person performs, or would perform under certain\ncircumstances, and which we would count as manifestations of the\nbelief, or lack of belief. (Assenting or dissenting when asked is one\nsuch action, but only one among a myriad.) In cases where we have\nevidence for or against the ascription of a belief to someone, the\nevidence consists in behaviour and there are presumably\nneurophysiological states which explain the behaviour. Those states are\nnot in practice specifiable in neurophysiological terms. Nevertheless,\nthe person’s being in those states is the physical fact in which\nthe truth of the ascription consists. Even where there is no behaviour\nof the relevant kind, there may still be dispositions to behave in\nthose ways under certain unrealized circumstances. The dispositions are\nthe physical states in which the truth of the ascription consists. So\nin most cases where we ascribe belief, there is a fact of the matter\nwhich makes the ascription true or false. (More on dispositions a few\nparagraphs hence.) \n\nThe belief idiom, however, also lends itself to use in other cases,\nwhere there is no fact of the matter. These are not merely cases in\nwhich we have no evidence. They are cases in which no behavioural tests\nwhich we might have carried out would have supplied evidence, cases in\nwhich there simply is nothing in the subject’s neurophysiology,\nand hence nothing in their actual or potential behaviour, which would\ndecide the matter. Quine puts the point like this: “Some beliefs,\nperhaps belief in the essential nobility of man qua man, are…\nnot readily distinguishable from mere lip service, and in such cases\nthere is no fact of the matter…. But most attributions or\nconfessions of belief do make sense…. The states of belief,\nwhere real, are… states of nerves.” (1986a, 429) \n\nQuine explicitly acknowledges that we could not in practice manage\nwithout idioms of propositional attitude, and that most uses of such\nidioms are entirely unobjectionable. But such idioms allow the\nformation of sentences which do not correspond to facts of the matter.\nFor that reason, Quine excludes them from regimented theory; they are\nnot be used when we are concerned with “limning the true and\nultimate structure of reality” (1960, 221). (Some philosophers\nmight insist: ‘Either you accept the concept of belief or you\ndon’t’. Quine would not agree; see 1986e for closely\nrelated remarks about the idea of knowing who someone is.) \n\nA somewhat similar point can be made about subjunctive or\ncounterfactual conditionals. Some are factual, but the general\ncounterfactual idiom allows for the formation of sentences which are\nnot factual. Like propositional attitudes, counterfactual conditionals\nhave an important role in our practical lives. They are also closely\nconnected with dispositions which, as we have seen, play a central role\nin Quine’s account of language and how it is learnt. The\nconnection is easily seen: to call an object fragile is to say that it\nwould break if it were dropped onto a hard surface\nfrom a significant height. \n\nQuine does not accept the general counterfactual idiom, “if\nX were to happen then Y would happen”, as part\nof regimented theory. As in the case of belief, the unrestricted use of\nthis idiom allows us to form sentences whose truth-conditions are, at\nbest, unclear. A famous example is the pair, presumably alluding to the\nKorean war of the early 1950s: “If Caesar were in charge he would\nuse the atom bomb”; “If Caesar were in charge he would use\ncatapults” (see Quine, 1960, 222); they seem equally plausible\nbut they cannot both be true (for a response, see Lewis 1973). In\nsuch cases, we have no reason to think that some (physical) fact is\nbeing claimed. Many dispositions, however, are perfectly acceptable by\nQuinean standards. To call the glass fragile is to attribute to it a\nstructure which would lead its breaking under certain circumstances; the\nstructure is a physical state, even if we cannot in practice specify it\nin physical terms. \n\nQuine claims that the dispositions he relies on in his account of\nlanguage are like the case of fragility rather than the case of Caesar.\nThe disposition to assent to an observation sentence when receiving\ncertain stimulations is a physical state of the person concerned; in\nparticular, presumably, of his or her brain. The claim that a given\nperson has such a disposition is thus a claim about the state of a\nphysical object. It is, moreover, a claim that we can test, at least\nunder favourable conditions. There is no reason to exclude it from\nregimented theory. \n\nAnother idiom which Quine famously excludes from regimented theory\nis that of modality, statements that such-and-such must be the\ncase, or cannot be the case, and so on. Such idioms have been\nthe subject of much discussion on the part of Quine and (especially)\nhis critics; the discussion here will be very brief. Technically, there\nare similarities with the case of belief. There is prima facie\nviolation of extensionality which can, however, be avoided by taking\nnecessity to apply to sentences; some philosophers have claimed that\nthere is a de re sense of necessity which does not lead to\neven prima facie violations of extensionality. Quine allows\nthat modal terms have a legitimate ordinary language use\n(‘possible’ is sometimes used to mean something like: we\ncan’t rule it out; see 1966, ch. 10). But his attitude towards\nthe philosophical use of the idea of modality, dividing truths into the\nnecessary and the possible, is far less sympathetic than his attitude\ntowards belief; he is particularly unsympathetic towards the idea of\nde re necessity, which he sees as requiring\n“Aristotelian essentialism” (Quine, 1953, 155). \n\nWhat frames these critical points about necessity is that Quine\nholds that regimented theory, the best and most objective statement of\nour knowledge, simply has no need for that notion. The benefit of\nincluding such idioms in regimented theory is not worth the cost in\nunclarity that it would bring. \n\nTruth, in Quine’s view, is immanent, as opposed to\ntranscendent. In accord with his fundamental naturalism, he sees\njudgments of truth as made from within our theory of the world. For\nthis reason, he sympathizes with what is sometimes called\ndisquotational theory of truth: to say that a sentence is true is, in\neffect, to assert the sentence. Two qualifications must be made. First,\nthe disquotational view is not a definition of “is\ntrue”. It enables us to eliminate the predicate from contexts in\nwhich it is applied to a finite number of specific sentences, but not\nfrom contexts where it is applied to infinitely many. Contexts of the\nlatter kind are of particular importance to logical theory. We say, for\nexample, that a conjunction is true just in case both conjuncts are\ntrue; here “is true” cannot be eliminated. (Unless, indeed,\nwe ascend to a metalanguage and give a definition of truth for the\nobject language that we are concerned with, following Tarski 1933.)\nSecond, calling an eternal sentence true is in one way unlike asserting\nit. If we subsequently change our verdict on it we say that we used to\nbelieve it but now we don’t. We do not, however, say that it used\nto be true but now it isn’t; rather we say that it was never\ntrue. Quine, however, sees this as simply a point of usage, with no\nparticular philosophical implications. \n\nIn this section we take up two ideas much discussed by commentators.\nNeither is essential to Quine’s overall philosophy, although in\neach case, but especially in the case of indeterminacy, the opposite\nclaim has been made. (See Ebbs, 1997; for a defense of the position\ntaken here, see Hylton, 2007.) \n\nThe basic idea of underdetermination is that two or more rival\ntheories might have all the same observational consequences, and thus\nbe empirically equivalent. Theory would thus be underdetermined by\nobservation. This might be held to call realism into question (as in\nvan Frassen 1980). Quine finds underdetermination harder to make sense\nof than might appear and, in any case, does not see a threat to\nrealism. \n\nIn Quine’s idealized schematization of the relation between\ntheory and evidence, evidence for theory consists of observation\ncategoricals. (These latter can, in turn, be tested by observing or\ncontriving situations in which relevant observation sentences are\ntrue.) The case which most obviously poses a potential threat to\nrealism is that of a final global theory, a perfected and completed\nversion of our own. What if there are two or more such theories,\nequally simple, each of which implies all true observation\ncategoricals? (Note that the theory will not be implied by all\nthe true observation categoricals; apart from other considerations,\nsome sentences of the theory will essentially contain terms which do\nnot occur in observation categoricals.) \n\nQuine is often thought to accept underdetermination. But in fact he\nholds that there is considerable difficulty in making non-trivial sense\nof the doctrine. He identifies theories with sets of sentences, not\nwith sets of sentence-meanings (propositions). So we can quite\ntrivially obtain an empirically equivalent alternative to any theory:\nsimply spell one of the theoretical terms differently at every\noccurrence. Strictly speaking, the result is a different set of\nsentences which implies all the same observation categoricals (1975a,\n319). The difference from the original theory, however, is merely\northographic; this possibility is clearly not of any philosophical\nsignificance. \n\nA closely related point can be made in terms of translation.\nTranslation of observation categoricals is quite unproblematic in\nprinciple. So we can count two theories as empirically equivalent not\nmerely if they imply the same observation categoricals but also if they\nimply intertranslateable observation categoricals. So classical physics\nas formulated in English (say) would, by this criterion, count as\nempirically equivalent to classical physics as formulated in German,\nyet the two formulations are, strictly speaking, different theories.\nQuite generally, any theory is empirically equivalent to its\ntranslation into any other language. But this fact is also not of any\ngreat philosophical significance, and certainly poses no threat to\nrealism. \n\nIn order to threaten realism, a version of underdetermination would\nthus have to assert that our postulated complete global theory of the\nworld has empirically equivalent alternatives and that no translation\nfrom one theory to the other is possible. Since the predicates of the\ntheory are its only non-logical vocabulary, this is equivalent to\nsaying that we cannot obtain one from the other by reconstruing the\npredicates of the theory. Quine comments: “This, for me, is an\nopen question.” (1975a, 327). Much of his subsequent discussion\nof underdetermination takes place in terms of the weaker idea that our\ntheory might have empirically equivalent alternatives and that\n“we would see no way of reconciling [them] by\nreconstrual of predicates” (loc. cit, emphasis added;\ncf. also 1990a, 97). \n\nIf some version of underdetermination were true, how should we\nrespond? This is an issue on which Quine has not merely changed his\nmind but vacillated, going back and forth between what he calls the\n“sectarian” and the “ecumenical” responses. The\nsectarian response is to say that we should not let the existence of\nthe alternative in any way affect our attitude towards our own theory:\nwe should continue to take it seriously, as uniquely telling us the\ntruth about the world. (We are assuming that the two theories possess\nall theoretical virtues to equal degree; clearly Quine would say that\nif one theory were superior in some way then we would have reason to\nadopt it.) The ecumenical response, by contrast, counts both theories\nas true. In almost his last word on the subject he suggests that there\nmay be little at stake since the “fantasy of irresolubly rival\nsystems of the world” takes us “out beyond where linguistic\nusage has been crystallized by use” (1990a, 100f). \n\nQuine can afford to vacillate because, in his view, nothing very\nmuch turns on the issue. In particular, he never holds that\nunderdetermination, in any version, would threaten realism; at no time\ndoes he suggest that it casts doubt on the truth of our theory. That is\nnot what is in question between the sectarian and the ecumenical\npositions; all that is in question is whether the alternative theory\nshould also be counted as true. Nor is this surprising. The\nterms in which underdetermination is stated, such as observation\ncategoricals, are part of our theory, as would be the demonstration\nthat another theory was empirically equivalent. The point here is the\nnaturalism which we have emphasized throughout. Nothing in our\nepistemology pronounces on the status of theory from an independent\nstandpoint; to the contrary: it presupposes the truth of our theory.\nThis central idea is not cast in doubt by underdetermination. (See\nSevero 2008; for criticism, see Moore 2015 and for a rejoinder to Moore\nsee Kemp 2016.) \n\nThe general claim of the indeterminacy of translation is that there\nmight be different ways of translating a language which are equally\ncorrect but which are not mere stylistic variants. The claim includes\nwhat one might think of as the limiting case of translation, that in\nwhich a given language is ‘translated’ into itself. \n\nSome philosophers hold that the idea of indeterminacy is absurd, or\nthat it amounts to an extreme form of scepticism about whether we ever\nunderstand one another, or whether correct translation is possible at\nall. (See for example Searle, 1987; for a reply, see Føllesdal,\n1990.) It is not hard to see how such opinions arise. One picture of\ncommunication is like this: you have an idea, a determinate meaning, in\nyour mind and convey it to me by your utterance. To those who have that\npicture, indeterminacy threatens the whole idea of communication, for\nit suggests that the conveying is always vulnerable to drastic\nfailure. In the case of translation, the analogous view is that\nsynonymy, or sameness of meaning, is the criterion of correct\ntranslation; in that case, indeterminacy may appear as a denial that\ntranslation is possible at all. \n\nSuch views, however, take for granted a view of communication, or of\ntranslation, which is very far from Quine’s. For Quine, the\ncriterion of successful communication, whether or not it involves\ntranslation, is fluent interaction, verbal and nonverbal:\n“Success in communication is judged by smoothness of\nconversation, by frequent predictability of verbal and nonverbal\nreactions, and by coherence and plausibility of native\ntestimony.” (1990a, 43) This is a third person or external view\nof language and communication, as required by Quine’s naturalism.\nFrom this point of view, talk of synonymy and of ideas in the mind is\nsimply a theoretical gloss which is (at best) in need of justification.\nQuine doubts that the gloss is justifiable; scepticism about the\ntheorizing, however, is not scepticism about the data. Smooth\ncommunication certainly occurs, sometimes in cases where different\nlanguages are involved. Quine says nothing that casts doubt on the idea\nthat successful translation (by his criterion) is possible; his claim,\nindeed, is that it may be possible in more than one way. \n\nAt this point we need to distinguish two kinds of indeterminacy.\nQuine introduces the general idea of indeterminacy, in Chapter Two of\n(1960), without explicitly distinguishing the two, but subsequently\ncomes to treat them quite differently. The first is indeterminacy\nof reference: some sentences can be translated in more than one\nway, and the various versions differ in the reference that they\nattribute to parts of the sentence, but not in the overall net import\nthat they attribute to the sentence as a whole. (Quine uses the terms\n“ontological relativity” and “inscrutability of\nreference”, as well as “indeterminacy of reference”.\nSome philosophers have sought to distinguish these doctrines, but in\nlater work Quine makes it clear that he uses the terms simply as\ndifferent names for the same thing. See Ricketts 2011, Roth, 1986, and\nQuine 1986d.) To use an example which has become famous, a given\nsentence might be translated as “There’s a rabbit” or\nas “Rabbithood is manifesting itself there” or as\n“There are undetached rabbit parts”, or in other ways\nlimited only by one’s ingenuity. All that is needed is what Quine\ncalls a proxy function, which maps each object onto another object and\neach predicate onto one which is true of a given proxy-object if and\nonly if the original predicate is true of the original object. For\nterms referring to physical objects, he suggests, we can take the\nproxy-function to map each object onto its space-time complement. The\nchange to the translation of singular terms and the change to the\ntranslation of predicates cancel out, leaving the overall significance\nof the sentence unchanged. The claim of indeterminacy of reference is\nnot in any way a claim about what goes on in the language-user’s\nmind (pace Wright 1997). (Note that it will not help to ask\nthe person we are translating whether she means to refer to the family\ndog or to its space-time complement: her answer is subject to the same\nindeterminacy.) \n\nIndeterminacy of reference is akin to a view of theoretical entities\nput forward by Ramsey: that there is no more to such an entity than the\nrole that it plays in the structure of the relevant theory (see Ramsey,\n1931). For Quine, however, the point holds for all objects, since he\n“see[s] all objects as theoretical… . Even our most\nprimordial objects, bodies, are already theoretical” (1981, 20).\nQuine holds, moreover, that considerations akin to those of the\nprevious paragraph amount to a “trivial proof” of\nindeterminacy of reference (1986c, 728). \n\nThe second kind of indeterminacy, which Quine sometimes refers to as\nholophrastic indeterminacy, is another matter. Here the claim\nis that there is more than one correct method of translating sentences\nwhere the two translations of a given sentence differ not merely in the\nmeanings attributed to the sub-sentential parts of speech but also in\nthe net import of the whole sentence. (Hence the two translations would\nexpress different propositions, in the abstract sense, or different\nFregean Gedanke; Quine claims that undermining these ideas was\npart of his motivation in developing the doctrine; see 1990d.) This\nclaim involves the whole language, so there are no examples, except\nperhaps of an exceedingly artificial kind. There is also nothing\nresembling a proof; in some late works, indeed, Quine refers to it as a\n“conjecture” (1986c, 728). At some earlier points, he seems\nto think that sufficiently clear-headed reflection on what goes into\ntranslation will suffice to make the idea at least plausible. All that\ncan be required of a method of translation is that it enables us to get\nalong with the speakers of the other language: why should there\nnot be more than one way to do it? \n\nArguments have been offered for holophrastic indeterminacy based on\nthe idea of underdetermination of theory by evidence (by Quine\nhimself in his 1970) . Perhaps there is determinate translation of\nobservation sentences, and thus of observation categoricals. Still, if\neach two distinct theories is compatible with all observational truths,\nsurely we could plausibly attribute either theory to the speaker of the\nother language. The weakness of this kind of argument is that\ntranslation must presumably preserve more than links between sentences\nand stimulations, as captured by observation sentences; it must also\npreserve links among sentences, links which make it more or less likely\nthat a person who accepts a given sentence will also accept another.\nCould there be methods of translation which preserved both kinds of\nlinks but nevertheless yielded different results? Quine’s term\n“conjecture” seems apt. \n\nGiven the interpretation advanced in section 3, above, indeterminacy\nis not crucial for Quine’s rejection of the sort of use that\nCarnap makes of the idea of analyticity. He has other arguments on that\nscore, as we saw. More generally, on the interpretation advanced here,\nindeterminacy is not a crucial part of Quine’s overall view. His\ncoming to speak of it as conjectural, while not questioning other parts\nof his philosophy, suggests that he would accept this. If we were sure\nthat translation is determinate, we could perhaps use the idea to\ndefine a notion of synonymy. (Agnosticism here favours the contrary\nposition.) And, as Quine has indicated, we could then define the\nmeaning of an expression as the set of synonymous expressions. Such a\nnotion of meaning might make some difference. It might, for example,\nprovide a criterion of identity which enabled us to accept beliefs as\nentities. It would not, however, play the most important roles in which\nphilosophers have cast the idea of meaning. In particular, it would not\nplay a role in the explanation of how we understand our language, or of\nhow communication between persons takes place. \n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, many scientifically-oriented philosophers\ntended to assume some form of Logical Empiricism. One important aspect\nof Quine’s influence on the course of philosophy is that he\ncalled that view or nexus of views into question (see section 3,\nabove). Some of his criticisms are detailed and technical. His target,\nhowever, was not a technical detail but the fundamental idea of Logical\nEmpiricism, that there is a distinction between analytic truths and\nsynthetic truths which can account for a priori truth. After\nQuine’s work of the early 1950s, philosophers, even those who did\nnot accept his detailed arguments could no longer take it for granted\nthat some form of Logical Empiricism is correct. This was a very major\nchange among scientifically-oriented philosophers. \n\nQuine’s rejection of Logical Empiricism leads him to two\n(connected) views which have been extremely influential. First, he\nrejects the idea of a distinction between philosophy on the one hand\nand empirical science on the other hand. To the contrary: he sees\nphilosophy as essentially in the same line of work as science, but\nmostly concerned with more theoretical and abstract questions. This is\nan integral part of his naturalism. Second, his criticism of Carnap,\nand of the Principle of Tolerance in particular, opens the way for\nsomething that might be called metaphysics: for very general\nreflections on the nature of the world, based on the best scientific\nknowledge that we have and on claims about how that knowledge might be\norganized so as to maximize its objectivity and clarity. \n\nBoth of these Quinean views, his naturalism and his acceptance of\nsomething like metaphysics, correspond to very important developments\nwithin analytic philosophy over the past half-century. His influence\nhas surely played a significant role here. (In the case of metaphysics,\nin particular, it is notable that two leading figures, Saul Kripke and\nDavid Lewis, were students of Quine’s.) For the most part,\nhowever, those Quinean doctrines have led to work to which Quine\nhimself would be strongly opposed. \n\nIn the case of naturalism, many philosophers have welcomed the idea\nthat they are free to use concepts and results drawn from empirical\nscience. Fewer have accepted that philosophy should also be constrained\nby scientific standards of clarity, of evidence, and of\nexplanatoriness. The result is that while views which claim to accept\nnaturalism are common, those which accept Quine’s standards of\nwhat counts as reputable naturalistic philosophy are not. \n\nThe case of metaphysics is similar but perhaps more extreme. Quine\naccepts that the philosopher is in a position to make very general\nclaims about the world (that there are sets but not properties, for\nexample). In his hands, such claims are answerable to the idea of a\ntotal system of our scientific knowledge, regimented so as to\nmaximize clarity and systematicity. Many philosophers have welcomed the\nfreedom to speculate about the nature of the world but have not\naccepted Quine’s constraints on the process. The result is a\nflourishing of metaphysics, often based on ordinary (unregimented)\nlanguage or on the alleged deliverances of ‘intuition’;\nmuch of this work would be anathema to Quine. (See Rosen 2014.) \n\nOn the one hand, then, Quine’s work has been extremely\ninfluential and has done much to shape the course of philosophy in the\nsecond-half of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first. On the\nother hand, much of the work directly or indirectly influenced by Quine\nis of a sort that he would have thought quite misguided.","contact.mail":"gary.kemp@glasgow.ac.uk","contact.domain":"glasgow.ac.uk"}]
