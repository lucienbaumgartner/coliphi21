At least two central\ntendencies are discernible among the approaches. First, they view\nepistemology as a normative discipline. Second, they view intellectual\nagents and communities as the primary focus of epistemic evaluation,\nwith a focus on the intellectual virtues and vices embodied in and\nexpressed by these agents and communities.\n\n\nThis entry introduces many of the most important results of the\ncontemporary VE research program. These include novel attempts to\nresolve longstanding disputes, solve perennial problems, grapple with\nnovel challenges, and expand epistemology’s horizons. In the\nprocess, it reveals the diversity within VE. Beyond sharing the two\nunifying commitments mentioned above, its practitioners diverge over\nthe nature of intellectual virtues, which questions to ask, and which\nmethods to use.\n\n\nIt will be helpful to note some terminology before proceeding. First,\nwe use ‘cognitive’, ‘epistemic’ and\n‘intellectual’ synonymously. Second, we often use\n‘normative’ broadly to include not only norms and rules,\nbut also duties and values. Finally, ‘practitioners’ names\ncontemporary virtue epistemologists. \n\nAt least two central tendencies are evident in VE taken as a\nwhole. \nOne central tendency is to view epistemology as a normative\ndiscipline. This implies at least two things. First, it signals\nopposition to Quine’s radical suggestion in “Epistemology\nNaturalized” that philosophers should abandon questions about\nwhat’s reasonable to believe, and should restrict themselves to\nquestions about cognitive psychology instead. Virtue epistemologists\nreject this proposal (McDowell 1994: 133; Sosa 1991: 100–105;\nZagzebski 1996: 334–8). Nevertheless, they are generally\nreceptive to empirical data from psychology, history, and other fields\n(e.g., Greco 2001; Roberts & Wood 2007: Part II; Sosa 1991:\n105–6; Zagzebski 1996: 336–7). Second, it implies that\nepistemologists should focus their efforts on understanding epistemic\nnorms, value, and evaluation. This is a defining feature of the field.\nAccordingly, VE features centrally in the recent “value\nturn” in epistemology (Riggs 2006; Pritchard 2007). \nFor some practitioners, however, the idea that epistemology is a\nnormative discipline means more than this. For example, some think\nthat epistemological terms (or concepts) like ‘knowledge’,\n‘evidence’, ‘justification’,\n‘duty’ and ‘virtue’ cannot be adequately\ndefined or fully explained in purely non-normative vocabulary (e.g.,\nAxtell & Carter 2008; McDowell 1994; Roberts & Wood 2007; and\nZagzebski 1996, 2009), although others disagree (e.g., Goldman 1992;\nGreco 1999, 2009; Sosa 2007). \nOthers think that epistemology should aim to promote intellectual well\nbeing. Perhaps an epistemological theory should be “practically\nuseful” in helping us recognize when we do or don’t know\nsomething (Zagzebski 1996: 267), or help us overcome\n“anxieties” due to defective presuppositions about\nknowledge (McDowell 1994: xi; Pritchard 2016a). Perhaps epistemology\nshould help us appreciate and respond to forms of “epistemic\ninjustice” (Fricker 2007). Perhaps epistemology should inspire\nus with portraits of intellectual virtues, thereby promoting cultural\nreformation and intellectual flourishing (Roberts & Wood 2007).\nPerhaps epistemology should examine intellectual vices and other\ndefects to tell cautionary tales of what not to do and how not to be\n(Alfano 2015, Battaly 2014, Cassam 2016). Or perhaps practitioners\nshould help redesign educational institutions to help students\ncultivate intellectual virtues (e.g., the Intellectual Virtues\nAcademy—see Other Internet Resources). \nThe other central tendency is to view intellectual agents and\ncommunities as the primary source of epistemic value and the primary\nfocus of epistemic evaluation. This focus includes not only\nindividuals and groups, but also the traits constitutive of their\ncognitive character. \nThis second commitment of VE is often accompanied by a\n“direction of analysis” characteristic of virtue theories\nin both ethics and epistemology. Virtue ethics explains an\naction’s moral properties in terms of the agent’s\nproperties, such as whether it results from kindness or spite. VE\nexplains a cognitive performance’s normative properties in terms\nof the cognizer’s properties, such as whether a belief results\nfrom hastiness or excellent eyesight, or whether an inquiry manifests\ncarelessness or discrimination. For virtue ethics the relevant\nproperties are moral traits, and for VE intellectual traits. \nBeyond those basic central tendencies, we find great diversity in the\nfield. Four main issues divide practitioners. The first concerns the\nnature and scope of intellectual virtues (section 3). The second\nconcerns what questions to address (section 4). The third concerns\nwhat methods to use (sections 4 and 9). The fourth concerns the\nrelations among epistemic virtue, knowledge, and epistemic credit\n(sections 5, 6, and 7).  \nPractitioners draw inspiration from many important historical\nphilosophers, including Plato (Zagzebski 1996: 139), Aristotle (Greco\n2002: 311; Sosa 2009: 187; Zagzebski 1996, passim), Aquinas (Roberts\n& Wood 2007: 69–70; Zagzebski 1996, passim), Descartes (Sosa\n2007: ch. 6), Kierkegaard (Roberts & Wood 2007: 29–30),\nNietzsche (Alfano 2013a), and Peirce (Hookway 2000). Hints of VE can\nalso be found in Hume (1748), Reid (1785), Russell (1948), and Sellars\n(1956). Islamic philosophy offers precursors to contemporary virtue\nepistemology, such as discussions of the epistemic value of\nimagination in al-Kindī and al-Fārābī (Adamson\n2015) and Avicenna’s sophisticated social epistemology of\nreliable and unreliable testimony (Black 2013). \nContemporary virtue epistemology, conceived as such and as a\ndistinctive movement within epistemology, began with Ernest\nSosa’s work in the early 1980s (see the papers collected in Sosa\n1991). Sosa applied his “virtue perspectivism” to\nadjudicate disputes in contemporary epistemology, such as the disputes\nbetween foundationalists and coherentists, and between internalists\nand externalists (for a review, see Turri 2013). Other important early\ncontributions were by Lorraine Code (1987), James Montmarquet (1993),\nJonathan Kvanvig (1992), and Linda Zagzebski (1996), who argued that\nSosa’s approach, while promising, did not go far enough in\nidentifying the central role of virtues, such as responsibility or\nconscientiousness, the social and developmental bases of virtues, or\nimportant relationships between intellectual and ethical virtues.\nOther approaches attempt to blend features of Sosa’s initial\napproach and these alternatives (e.g., Greco 1993). It has also been\nargued that early versions of reliabilism are best interpreted as a\nform of VE (Kvanvig 1992). \nStart with an uncontroversial, but still informative, characterization\nof intellectual virtues: intellectual virtues are characteristics that\npromote intellectual flourishing, or which make for an excellent\ncognizer. \nVE is standardly divided up into virtue responsibilists and virtue\nreliabilists (e.g., Axtell 1997), though the aptness of this\ndistinction has come into question (Fleisher 2017). According to this\ntaxonomy, the two camps differ over how to characterize intellectual\nvirtue. Virtue reliabilists (e.g., Goldman, Greco, and Sosa)\nunderstand intellectual virtues to include faculties such as\nperception, intuition, and memory; call these\n‘faculty-virtues’. Their view is best understood as a\ndescendant from earlier externalist epistemologies such as simple\nprocess reliabilism. Virtue responsibilists (e.g., Battaly, Code,\nHookway, Montmarquet, and Zagzebski) understand intellectual virtues\nto include cultivated character traits such as conscientiousness and\nopen-mindedness; call these ‘trait-virtues’. Their\napproach is broadly aligned with internalist sympathies in\nepistemology and deeply concerned with cognition’s ethical\ndimensions and implications. \nThis reliabilist/responsibilist taxonomy has attracted criticism.\nFirst, it is not clear why practitioners need to choose between\nfaculty-virtues and trait-virtues. At first glance, excellent\nperception, good memory, open-mindedness, and intellectual humility\nall seem equally good candidates to promote excellence or flourishing.\nArguments over which are the “real” virtues can seem\npointless and counterproductive, since many are the ways of excelling\nand flourishing intellectually (Battaly 2015). Second, and closely related,\nit is plausible that a complete epistemology must feature both\nfaculty-virtues and trait-virtues. Faculty-virtues seem indispensable\nin accounting for knowledge of the past and the world around us.\nTrait-virtues could be required to account for the full range of\nricher intellectual achievements, such as understanding and wisdom,\nwhich might presuppose knowledge but which arguably also exceed it\n(compare Zagzebski 2001: 248–9). Baehr (2006b) argues that\nvirtue reliabilists should not neglect trait-virtues, because these\nare necessary to explain some cases of knowledge. For instance,\nintellectual courage and perseverance, not just good memory and\nperception, might figure centrally in an explanation of how a knower\narrived at the truth. \nBattaly (2008: 7) provides a helpful list of questions to guide\ninquiry into the nature of intellectual virtue: \nThere are five primary questions that analyses of the intellectual\nvirtues should address. First, are the virtues natural or acquired?\nSecond, does virtue possession require the agent to possess acquired\nintellectually virtuous motivations or dispositions to perform\nintellectually virtuous actions? Third, are the virtues distinct from\nskills? Fourth, are the virtues reliable? Finally, fifth, what makes\nthe virtues valuable? Are they instrumentally, constitutively, or\nintrinsically valuable? \nJason Kawall (2002) calls attention to a set of virtues neglected by\nvirtue epistemologists of all stripes. Virtue ethicists have long\nrecognized a difference between self-regarding moral virtues, such as\nprudence and courage, and other-regarding virtues, such as benevolence\nand compassion. And they have recognized the importance of both\nsorts. But virtue epistemologists have overlooked a similar\ndistinction among intellectual virtues. They focus on self-regarding\nintellectual virtues, such as perceptual acuity or intellectual\ncourage, which promote the individual’s own intellectual\nflourishing. They neglect other-regarding intellectual virtues, such\nas honesty and integrity, which promote other people’s\nacquisition of knowledge and intellectual flourishing. More complex\nother-regarding virtues would involve a willingness and ability to\narticulately communicate one’s reasons to others, or the\ncreativity to discover knowledge new to a community. “An\nepistemic agent who focuses exclusively on self-regarding epistemic\nvirtues”, Kawall (2002: 260) writes, “could be a deficient\nepistemic agent to the extent that she is a member of a\ncommunity”. Such attention to the cognitive agent’s\nepistemic community also informs research on epistemic justice and\ninjustice (Fricker 2007, Sherman 2016) and recent explorations of\nembedded, scaffolded, and extended intellectual character (Alfano\n2013b, 2014b; Alfano & Skorburg 2017, forthcoming), topics to\nwhich we return in section 9. \nDisagreements about the nature of virtue are closely connected to\nanother pair of disagreements. These disagreements concern which\nquestions and methods should feature in epistemology. \nMany practitioners deploy VE’s resources to address standard\nquestions in standard ways. (Here ‘standard’ means\n‘standard for contemporary Anglo-American epistemology’.)\nThey offer analyses or definitions of knowledge and justification.\nThey try to solve puzzles and problems, such as the Gettier problem\nand the lottery problem. They construct counterexamples. They confront\nthe skeptic. This is conventional VE. \nOther practitioners address alternative questions or use alternative\nmethods. They shun definitions and tidy analyses. They focus on topics\nother than knowledge and justification, such as deliberation, inquiry,\nunderstanding, wisdom, profiles of individual virtues and vices,\nexaminations of the relations among distinct virtues and vices, and\nthe social, ethical, and political dimensions of cognition. They\nignore the radical skeptic. They mine literature and drama for\ninspiration and examples. This is alternative VE. \nAn example of conventional VE is Ernest Sosa’s (1991: section\nIV) attempt to define knowledge as true belief held “out of\nintellectual virtue”, or to settle the dispute among\ninternalists and externalists about epistemic justification (Sosa\n2003: ch. 9), providing detailed definitions and carefully trying to\ndisarm counterexamples. Another prime example of conventional VE is\nLinda Zagzebski’s (1996: part III) definition of knowledge and\nattempted resolution of the Gettier problem. \nAn example of extreme alternative VE is Robert Roberts and Jay\nWood’s (2007) view that conventional questions and methods have\neviscerated epistemology, and that we should instead aim to reform\nintellectual culture by sketching subtle and nuanced pictures\n(“maps”) of the intellectual virtues, drawing freely on\nliterature, history, and scripture. Another example is Jonathan\nKvanvig’s (1992) argument that VE will flourish only by\nrelinquishing the Cartesian epistemological project and instead\nfocusing on the role virtues play in training and education. Others\nhave argued that the kernel of truth in VE is best developed in an\ninterdisciplinary context drawing on the methods and findings of the\ncognitive, social, and life sciences (Turri 2015a). \nThe foregoing does not imply that VE is a house divided against\nitself. On the contrary, we find a spectrum of conventional and\nalternative approaches rather than a simple dichotomy, and among\nvarious practitioners we often see a “live and let live”\nattitude. Thus while some practitioners of alternative VE counsel a\nradical, wholesale break from conventional questions or methods, most\neither blend conventional and alternative elements (e.g., Zagzebski,\nRiggs, Battaly), or see value in conventional VE (e.g., Baehr 2011).\nConventional practitioners likewise recognize that\n“alternative” questions are not only important but as old\nas philosophy itself, such as questions about wisdom and the social\ntransmission of virtues. The same goes for the\n“alternative” methods of consulting literature, as Plato\nlooked to Homer, approaching philosophical questions with scientific\ntools, as Aristotle inquired into the biological and social bases of\ncognition, and referring to scripture, as the Islamic philosophical\ntradition did in relation to the norms of testimony. \nMany virtue epistemologists agree that, in very general terms,\nknowledge is non-accidentally true belief. Different theories spell\nout “non-accidentally” differently, but among many\npractitioners a common understanding of that key term seems to have\nemerged. Simply put, to know is to believe the truth because of your\nintellectual virtue (e.g., Sosa 1991: 277; Zagzebski 1996:\n271–2, Riggs 2002: 93–4; Lehrer 2000: 223; Greco 2003:\n111; Turri 2011). \nOne benefit claimed for this basic approach is that it provides an\nintuitive account of why knowledge is inconsistent with luck of a\ncertain sort. For instance, some begin with the intuitive thought that\nyou don’t know something if it is “largely a matter of\nluck” that you believe it (Riggs 2007). But why does knowledge\npreclude luck in this way? In the first detailed attempt to answer\nthis question, Wayne Riggs says that the opposition between knowledge\nand luck is best explained by the hypothesis that knowledge is\n“an achievement for which the knower deserves credit”\n(Riggs 2009: 341). And knowers deserve credit because they believe the\ntruth because of their virtue (Greco 2003). In response, some have\nargued that luck and virtue are orthogonal dimensions of epistemic\nevaluation (Pritchard 2012), and that knowledge must be due to virtue\nmore than luck, as opposed to virtue rather than\nluck (Carter 2014). \nA related benefit of the basic approach is that, in the eyes of many\npractitioners, it solves the Gettier problem. Gettier cases follow a\nrecipe. Start with a belief sufficiently justified to meet the\njustification condition for knowledge. Then add an element of bad luck\nthat would normally prevent the justified belief from being true.\nLastly add a dose of good luck that “cancels out the bad”,\nso the belief ends up true anyhow. It has proven difficult to explain\nwhy this “double luck” prevents knowledge (Zagzebski\n1996). \nHere is a Gettier case (adapted from Zagzebski 1996: 285–6).\nMary enters the house and looks into the living room. A familiar\nappearance greets her from her husband’s chair. She thinks,\n“My husband is sitting in the living room”, and then walks\ninto the den. But Mary misidentified the man in the chair. It is not\nher husband, but his brother, whom she had no reason to believe was\neven in the country. However, her husband was seated along the\nopposite wall of the living room, out of Mary’s sight, dozing in\na different chair. \nThe VE solution to the Gettier problem is that knowledge requires you\nto believe the truth “because of” your intellectual\nvirtues, but Gettier subjects do not believe the truth because of\ntheir virtues, so they do not know (Zagzebski 1996: 285 ff; Greco\n2003; Sosa 2007: ch. 5; Turri 2011). Some critics complain that this\nview is uninformative because we lack an adequate understanding of\nwhat it is to believe “because of” or “out of”\nvirtue (e.g., Roberts & Wood 2007). Other critics argue that the\nbasic approach still suffers from counterexamples (e.g., Baehr 2006a;\nChurch 2013). \nRecently, leading practitioners have touted the fact that VE places\nknowledge in a familiar pattern. On this approach, epistemic\nevaluation is just another example of the basic way in which we\nevaluate all behavior and performances. The most widely discussed\narticulation of this view is Ernest Sosa’s AAA–model of\nperformance assessment (Sosa 2007: 22–3; for related but subtly\ndifferent approaches, see Greco 2003 & 2010 and Morton 2013). On\nthis approach, we can assess performances for accuracy, adroitness,\nand aptness. Accurate performances achieve their aim, adroit\nperformances manifest competence, and apt performances are accurate\nbecause adroit. This AAA-model applies to all conduct and performances\nwith an aim, whether intentional (as in ballet) or unintentional (as\nwith a heartbeat). \nHere’s how the model applies in epistemology. (A more\ncomplicated model has lately been proposed, which takes into account\nthe agent’s own risk-assessment and decisions about when and how\nto perform; see Sosa 2015.) Belief-formation is a psychological\nperformance with an aim. For beliefs, accuracy is identified with\ntruth, adroitness with manifesting intellectual competence, and\naptness with being “true because competent”. Apt belief,\nthen, is belief that is true because competent. A competence, in\nturn,  \nis a disposition, one with a basis resident in the competent agent,\none that would in appropriately normal conditions ensure (or make\nhighly likely) the success of any relevant performance issued by it.\n(Sosa 2007: 29)  \nKnowledge is then identified with apt belief, which is just “a\nspecial case” of “creditable, apt performance”, a\nstatus common across the gamut of human activities. \nConsider the performance of an archer who hits a bullseye because she\nshoots competently. Her shot is apt, and her bullseye an achievement.\nIt’s possible that she might easily have missed. She might have\nluckily avoided being drugged before the competition, which would have\nimpaired her competence. Or a strong gust of wind, which would have\nruined her shot, might have just been avoided by a rare confluence of\nlocal meteorological conditions. In any of these ways, her performance\nmight have been apt even though there are nearby possible worlds in\nwhich she does not hit the bullseye. Sosa (2007: 31) says that\nknowledge is also like this: in some cases you might believe aptly,\nand thus know, even though you might easily have been wrong.  Some have argued that this feature of Sosa’s view opens it\nup to counterexamples. For example, Duncan Pritchard (2009a), echoing\nJennifer Lackey’s (2007) broader criticism of credit views of\nknowledge, argues that Sosa’s view gives the wrong verdict in\nthe fake-barn thought experiment (originally due to Carl Ginet; see\nGoldman 1976: 772–3). In this thought experiment, Henry and his\nson are driving through the country.  Henry pulls over to stretch his\nlegs, and while doing so regales his son with a list of currently\nvisible roadside items.  “That’s a tractor. That’s a\ncombine. That’s a horse. That’s a silo. And that’s a\nfine barn”, he adds, pointing to the nearby roadside barn. But\nunbeknownst to them, the locals recently secretly replaced nearly\nevery barn in the country with fake barns (they’re in\n“Fake Barn Country”).  Henry happens to see the one real\nbarn in the whole county. Had he instead set eyes on any of the\nnumerous nearby fakes, he would have falsely believed it was a\nbarn. \nHenry has a true belief because of his perceptual acuity, Pritchard\nsays, so it counts as apt and Sosa’s view entails that Henry\nknows. But, Pritchard claims, it’s obvious that Henry\ndoesn’t know. Pritchard (2008a: 445) raises an exactly similar\nobjection to Greco’s theory of knowledge. Criticism on this\npoint has come on two fronts. On the one hand, some epistemologists\nhave argued that (contra Pritchard) fake-barn-style cases, which\nfeature environmental luck, are not cases of apt belief or cognitive\nachievement (e.g., Jarvis 2013; Littlejohn 2014). On the other hand,\nsome reject the claim that the agent doesn’t know in this case\nor structurally similar ones (e.g., Lycan 2006; Turri 2011). Moreover,\nrecent experimental work has shown that non-philosophers\noverwhelmingly view fake-barn cases, and structurally similar ones, as\ninstances of knowledge (Colaço, Buckwalter, Stich & Machery\n2014; Turri, Buckwalter, & Blouw 2014; Turri 2016c). \nWhat is the nature of epistemic value and how is knowledge\ndistinctively epistemically valuable? In particular, why is knowledge\nmore valuable than mere true belief, especially if true belief serves\njust as well for guiding action? Such questions have occupied center\nstage in recent epistemology and date back at least to Plato’s\nMeno (see Pritchard & Turri 2014 for an overview). Many\nvirtue epistemologists think that their approach is uniquely suited to\nprovide satisfying answers to these questions. \nZagzebski (2003) argues that an adequate account of knowledge must\nexplain why knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief. This is\nknown as “the value problem”. VE is well positioned to\nsolve it, she argues, because the correct solution must help us see\nhow knowledge possesses value independently of anything\n“external” to its production. A good cup of coffee is not\nbetter simply because it was made by a good, reliable coffee machine.\nLikewise a true belief is not made better simply because it was formed\nby a reliable method. The added value must come from something\n“internal” to it. The solution is to view knowledge as a\ncredit-worthy state of the agent, produced or sustained by her\nvirtuous agency. \nGreco (2009, 2012)\nand Sosa (2003, 2007) contend that knowledge is a kind of\nachievement—intellectual success through ability, for which the\nknower is creditable. And in general, success through virtue is more\nvaluable than mere success, especially accidental success. So\nknowledge is more valuable than true belief. Riggs (2009: 342) puts\nthe point succinctly:  \nThe reason that credit-worthiness views of knowledge can solve the\nvalue problem is that they introduce a new vector of value:\ncredit…. If knowing that p always entails that one\ndeserves credit for having achieved a true belief, then this\nintroduces something besides true belief that is valuable  \n(Riggs 1998 & 2002 offer the same basic argument.) Carter, Jarvis\nand Rubin (2015) propose a taxonomy of varieties of cognitive\nachievement based on the relative weights given to achieving success\nversus avoiding failure; for example, having a suspicion that p\nis a cognitive attempt that puts more weight on achieving success,\nwhereas Cartesian certainty that p is a cognitive attempt to\nputs almost exclusive weight on avoiding failure. \nAristotle made a related distinction between achieving some end by\nluck or accident, and achieving it through the exercise of one’s\nabilities or virtues. It is only the latter kind of action, he argues,\nthat is both intrinsically valuable and constitutive of human\nflourishing. “Human good”, he writes, “turns out to\nbe activity of soul exhibiting excellence” (Nicomachean\nEthics 1098a15-16; translation by W. D. Ross 1984, p. 1735). The\nsuccessful exercise of one’s intellectual virtues is both\nintrinsically good and constitutive of human flourishing. This\npertains to moral and intellectual virtue. Assuming the basic VE line\non knowledge is correct, we get a straightforward solution to the\nvalue problem. \nAs we reviewed in the sections on knowledge and epistemic value, a\nvery popular thesis in VE is that knowledge is a credit-worthy state\nof the agent. You know only if you deserve credit for believing the\ntruth. Call this “the credit thesis”. The credit thesis\nhelps explain knowledge’s value. It also features prominently in\nattempts to resolve the Gettier problem and explain epistemic\nluck. \nJennifer Lackey (2007) argues that we do not deserve credit for\neverything we know, so (a) standard VE definitions of knowledge are\nfalse, and (b) VE is not ideally suited to explain knowledge’s\nvalue. She presents counterexamples involving testimonial and innate\nknowledge. On Lackey’s understanding, to earn credit for a true\nbelief, your “reliable cognitive faculties” must be\n“the most salient part” of the explanation for why you\nbelieve the truth (Lackey 2007: 351; see also Greco 2003: 130).\nCognitive faculties cannot be merely necessary or important parts of\nthe explanation, she argues, because then Gettier problems would\nimmediately arise (Lackey 2007: 347–8). \nHere is a close variant of one of Lackey’s cases (Lackey 2007:\n352), which she later (2009) calls “Chicago Visitor”:\nMorris just arrived at the Chicago train station and wants directions\nto the Sears Tower. He approaches the first adult passerby he sees\n(“Passerby”) and asks for directions. Passerby knows the\ncity extraordinarily well and articulately offers impeccable\ndirections: the tower is two blocks east of the station. On that basis\nMorris unhesitatingly forms the corresponding true belief. \nLackey reasons as follows. Morris clearly gains knowledge of the\ntower’s location. But Passerby’s contribution is most\nsalient in explaining why Morris learned the truth. Morris’s\ncontribution to the process is minimal. Morris’s reliable\ncognitive faculties are not the most salient part of the explanation\nfor why he believes the truth. So he doesn’t deserve credit. But\nhe knows nonetheless. So the credit thesis is false. \nLackey also asks us to consider “the possibility of natural\ninnate knowledge” (Lackey 2007: 358). Surely such knowledge is\npossible, so an adequate theory of knowledge must accommodate the\npossibility. But “it seems highly unlikely that a subject would\ndeserve credit for such knowledge”. For the belief’s\norigin, “such as natural selection or some other evolutionary\nmechanism”, would be the most salient part of the explanation\nfor why you had the true belief. So the credit thesis is false. \nGreco (2007) responds that Morris still deserves credit for learning\nthe truth. Credit for cooperative success can accrue to multiple\nindividuals, even ones who contribute less than others. It generally\nrequires only that your “efforts and abilities” be\n“appropriately involved” in the success (Greco 2007: 65).\nSuppose we’re playing ice hockey and you make an extraordinarily\nbrilliant play to set me up for a goal. The goalie prostrate outside\nhis crease, the defensemen dizzy and confused behind the net, I simply\ntap the puck in. Your contribution dwarfs mine, but I still deserve\ncredit for the goal. Likewise, Passerby does most of the work, yet\nMorris still gets credit because his intellectual abilities were\nappropriately involved. Examples like this highlight the difficulty of\ndividing responsibility for cooperative achievements as if it should\nsum to 100 percent. The individualism presupposed by this summative\nassumption is challenged by recent arguments for embedded, scaffolded,\nand extended knowledge (see section 9). \nSosa (2007: 95) responds that Morris still deserves “partial\ncredit”, even though his success in believing the truth is\nprimarily attributable to a “socially seated competence”\nembodied in the people involved in the testimonial chain. This\nsuffices for his belief to be apt, and thus count as knowledge.\nPartial credit grounded in apt performance is a perfectly general\nphenomenon, as common in team sport as in testimony.  \nThe quarterback’s pass derives from his competence, but its\ngreat success, its being a touchdown pass manifests more\nfully the team’s competence. \nRiggs (2009: 209) responds that it isn’t clear that Morris does\nknow where the tower is. We aren’t compelled to count as\nknowledge every “casual, unreflective acceptance of\ntestimony” (Riggs 2009: 214). And notice that if we continue the\nstory by having someone soon afterward ask Morris where the tower is,\nhe’d be out of line to simply assert, “It’s two\nblocks that way”, which suggests that he doesn’t really\nknow after all (Riggs 2009: 210–11). Beyond that, Riggs\ndistinguishes two senses of credit: praiseworthiness and\nattributability. Knowledge requires that your true belief be\nattributable to you as an agent, but not that you be praiseworthy for\nit. Riggs claims that Lackey’s objections wrongly suppose that\ndefenders of the credit thesis think that knowledge requires\npraiseworthiness, are too closely tied to Greco’s particular\naccount of credit (with its emphasis on explanatory salience), and\nalso overlook the possibility of “group effort” in\nachievements. \nLackey (2009) replies to Greco, Riggs, and Sosa. Her response is\nsubtle and multidimensional, but its centerpiece is a dilemma for\nVE’s credit thesis. Either VE’s notion of creditworthiness\nis substantial enough to rule out credit for Gettier subjects or it\nisn’t. If it is substantial enough, then it rules out too much\ntestimonial knowledge, in which case it fails. If it isn’t\nsubstantial enough, then it suffers refutation by Gettier cases, in\nwhich case it still fails. Either way, it fails. (Compare Kvanvig\n2003; Pritchard 2008b.) \nAccording to a widely debated view in recent epistemology,\ncontextualism, the truth conditions for knowledge attributions such as\n“S knows that P” are context-sensitive, due to the\ncontext-sensitivity of the cognitive verb “know” (for a\nreview, see Rysiew 2016).  Contextualists disagree over how to model\nthe alleged context-sensitivity. Some say “know” is an\nindexical possessing a context-invariant character that is a function\nfrom contexts to contents (Cohen 2013). Others claim that\n“knows” is a vague predicate in need of contextual\nsupplementation to predicate a determinate property (Heller\n1999). Critics argue that leading contextualist proposals are ad hoc\nor unmotivated because we lack independent evidence that\n“knows” is context-sensitive in these ways (Stanley 2005),\nor because behavioral experiments demonstrate that people do not\nevaluate knowledge attributions in the way that leading contextualists\nhave assumed or predicted (Turri 2016b). \nGreco (2004, 2008) defends a version of contextualism, what he calls\n“virtue contextualism”. Virtue contextualism emerges from\nthe basic idea, mentioned above, that to know is to believe the truth\nbecause of your intellectual virtue or ability. When we say\n“because of your intellectual virtue or ability”, how are\nwe to understand “because”? In general, explanatory talk\nis context-sensitive. It is context-sensitive in two primary ways.\nFirst, abnormal features tend to be explanatorily salient.\nThere’s a panic in a Manhattan apartment building, which happens\nvery soon after a tiger wanders into the lobby. We have no trouble\nidentifying the panic’s cause: the tiger. That’s true even\nthough the tiger’s presence isn’t individually sufficient\nto cause a panic—people must also fear tigers, but they normally\ndo. Second, our interests and purposes single out certain features as\nespecially relevant. We tend to focus on things we can control. If a\nstudent asks a teacher why he failed the exam, the teacher might point\nout that he rarely came to class and didn’t pick up a study\nguide until the morning of the exam. \nIf explanatory talk is generally context-sensitive, and knowledge-talk\nis just a species of explanatory-talk, then perhaps\nknowledge-attributions are too. By changing what seems normal or by\nchanging our interests and purpose, we might go from a context where\nsaying “S believes the truth because of her virtue”\nexpresses a truth, to a context where uttering the same words\nexpresses a falsehood. And since saying “S knows” is\ntantamount to saying “S believes the truth because of her\nvirtue”, it follows that knowledge-attributions are likewise\ncontext-sensitive. By deriving its account of context-sensitivity from\nthe general character of explanatory-talk, virtue contextualism might\navoid the charge that it is unmotivated and ad hoc. However, further\nwork is required to test whether the theory fits with people’s\nactual linguistic behavior. \nAs mentioned above, practitioners of all stripes tend to recognize the\nimportance of empirical findings about cognition and inquiry. There\nare multiple reasons for this sensitivity beyond a predilection for\nnaturalism. First, even though VE is a normative discipline as\ndiscussed above, some practitioners accept a version of the ought\nimplies can principle. To the extent that empirical research in\npsychology, cognitive science, and other fields delineates the limits\nof human cognition, such research constrains the inquiries,\ndispositions, and states that can be epistemically demanded of people.\nMore ambitiously, one might think that extremely demanding epistemic\nnorms are sometimes inappropriate even if, strictly speaking, they can\nbe satisfied. Second, even if one rejects ought implies can,\nan alleged strength of VE is its ability to respond successfully to\nskepticism. However, if the dispositions practitioners assume to exist\nare never or rarely embodied by humans, then skepticism looms. Note\nthat this argument goes through even if people could acquire and\nmanifest epistemic virtues, just so long as they in fact don’t.\nThird, empirical research may help to solve the generality\nproblem. Any episode of acquiring a belief can be classed under\nan indefinite number of headings; some such classifications\nindividuate highly reliable dispositions, while others individuate\nless reliable dispositions. When I infer from the fact that every\nemerald I’ve examined is green that every emerald (whether\nexamined or not) is green, should my inference be described as\ninductive generalization or inductive generalization\nemploying projectable predicates? Though the generality problem\nwas first articulated as a hurdle for process reliabilism (Pollock\n1984), Goldman (1986: 50) and Zagzebski (1996: 300) recognize that VE\nfaces its own version of the problem. Should epistemic virtues be\ncoarsely individuated, so that open-mindedness makes the cut,\nor should they be finely individuated, so that open-mindedness\ntowards friends while in a good mood makes the cut? Zagzebski\n(1996: 309) argues that this question should be answered empirically,\nwith a preference for coarse individuation. Finally, practitioners who\nfavor an ameliorative or educative approach to VE have an additional\nreason to attend to empirical findings, because these may reveal\ncommon cognitive defects that could potentially be set right, as well\nas suggesting more promising prospects for cognitive and epistemic\ntraining and development than those employed in contemporary\npedagogy. \nThese considerations notwithstanding, the cognitive sciences might\npose a threat to VE. After all, to the extent that people’s\ncognitive dispositions do not qualify as virtues (because they are\nunreliable or irresponsible, for example), the true beliefs they\nproduce will not count as knowledge (Alfano 2012). Recall that\npractitioners are largely in agreement that knowledge is true belief\nthat manifests virtue. If empirical studies suggest that\npeople’s beliefs usually manifest cognitive defects or\nincompetence, then VE would be led to the conclusion that most of our\ntrue beliefs don’t count as knowledge. This challenge to VE is\nanalogous to the “situationist challenge” to virtue ethics\n(Doris 1998, 2002; Flanagan 1991; Harman 1999; for a recent\narticulation, see Merritt, Doris, and Harman 2010). \nMark Alfano (2012: 234) first framed the problem as an inconsistent\ntriad: anti-skepticism, according to which almost all humans\nhave quite a bit of knowledge, epistemic situationism,\naccording to which most people’s intellectual dispositions are\nnot virtues because they are highly sensitive to seemingly trivial and\nepistemically irrelevant situational factors, and VE. Regarding the\nreliability of people’s inferential dispositions, Alfano (2014a,\n2013b: chapter 6) pointed to a robust series of findings related to\nthe unreliability of heuristics such as the availability heuristic,\nthe representativeness heuristic, and the recognition heuristic.\nRegarding responsibilist VE, Alfano (2012, 2013b: chapter 5)\nemphasized findings on the substantial influence of seemingly trivial\nbut epistemically irrelevant factors on belief-formation. These\nfactors include mood elevators, mood depressors, and social cues of\nunanimous versus non-unanimous agreement. Subsequently, while a few\nphilosophers have twisted the empirical knife further (e.g., Olin and\nDoris 2014; Blumenthal-Barby 2015), at least four lines of response\nhave emerged. \nThe first main response to epistemic situationism is to deny that\nthere is a problem, referring to more heartening empirical evidence.\nFor example, Fairweather and Montemayor (2014) argue that\nheuristics—instead of being unreliable mental\nshortcuts—are more reliable than traditional inferential\npatterns that people tend to misuse. In a similar vein, Samuelson and\nChurch (2015) argue that heuristics, when properly monitored and\ninterrupted by top-down effortful cognition, can be reliable, and that\neffective exercise of such top-down control constitutes a version of\nthe responsibilist virtue of intellectual humility. And King (2014a)\ndefends responsibilism by pointing out that, at least on\nZagzebski’s (1996) version of VE, knowledge needn’t\nmanifest virtue but instead needs only to arise from the sort of\nmotivated inquiry that a virtuous person would engage in. \nThe second main response is more conciliatory, suggesting that VE\nshould focus less on achieving virtue and more on avoiding vice.\nRoberts and West (2015) contend that research on heuristics and\nrelated cognitive biases shows that humans are best understood as\nmanifesting various natural epistemic defects. The work of becoming a\ngood-enough cognizer is then a matter of cultivating ways of avoiding\nor overcoming these defects.  They suggest that self-vigilance and\nincreased intellectual vitality are two key ways to handle these\ndefects, making their view somewhat similar to that of Samuelson and\nChurch (2015). Cassam (2016) argues that the extensive literature on\nconspiracy theories and conspiratorial thinking shows that people are\nprone to various intellectual vices, understood as character traits\nthat impede effective and responsible inquiry. Understanding human\ninquiry and how it is liable to go wrong thus requires a study of\nintellectual vices.  Alfano (2014b) explores the phenomenon of\nstereotype threat from the perspective of intellectual vice, arguing\nthat susceptibility to stereotype threat should be construed as an\nepistemic defect for which the social environment, rather than the\nagent, is responsible. This suggests that overcoming at least some\nepistemic vices requires a social or institutional approach. \nThis suggestion is in line with the third main response to epistemic\nsituationism, which is to somehow offload some of the cognitive agency\ntraditionally required of the individual onto the material, social, or\npolitical environment. For instance, Pritchard (2014) argues for a\nmore modest version of VE that countenances the essential role of the\nenvironment in the acquisition of knowledge. Someone who is luckily\nplaced in their material, social, and political environment will end\nup with more knowledge despite less exercise of cognitive agency than\nsomeone who is unluckily placed, even if the latter exercises heroic\nlevels of cognitive agency. Epistemic situationism is thus\nreinterpreted as evidence for our inescapable epistemic dependence on\ncircumstance. Alfano (2013b, 2016a) and Alfano and Skorburg (2017,\nforthcoming) connect the challenge of epistemic situationism with the\nliterature in the philosophy of mind on embedded, scaffolded, and\nextended cognition inspired by Clark and Chalmers (1998; see also\nSterelny 2010). The basic idea here is that when a cognitive agent is\nsuitably integrated with natural objects, artifacts, and other agents\nin their material, social, and political environment, those externalia\nmay be partially constitutive of the agent’s cognitive\ndispositions. Embedded cognition occurs in a mostly-stable natural\nenvironment; scaffolded cognition occurs in a mostly-stable artificial\nenvironment; outright extended cognition occurs in a\ndynamically-reactive environment. Within this taxonomy, Alfano and\nSkorburg (forthcoming) argue that it is possible to improve the\nreliability of the recognition heuristic not by developing further\ninternal cognitive resources (as Samuelson & Church 2015 and\nRoberts & West 2015 would have it) but by better structuring the\ninformational ecosystem in which people find themselves—a\nsuggestion that harmonizes with recent work on the epistemology of\ninformation and communication technologies such as the Internet\n(Bozdag & van den Hoven 2015; Lynch 2016) and library sciences\n(Fallis & Whitcomb 2009). Alfano (2016a) and Alfano and Skorburg\n(2017) argue that, in some cases, pairs of agents mutually constitute\neach other’s character by engaging in dynamic interactions with\ninterlocking virtues. One example they focus on is friendship, where\nmy being your friend is partly constituted by your being my friend,\nand vice versa. The literature on embedded, scaffolded, and extended\nepistemic virtues is a natural development of VE’s emphasis on\nintellectual agents and communities. \nA fourth response is that there is no evidence that knowledge requires\nthe sort of dispositions that epistemic situationism challenges and,\nmoreover, that there is theoretical and empirical evidence that\nknowledge does not require such dispositions (Turri 2017). More\nspecifically, according to this line of criticism, no serious argument\nhas ever been provided that knowledge requires reliability; instead,\nphilosophers have relied on weak explanatory arguments or, more\ncommonly, simply assumed that knowledge requires reliability (Turri\n2016a). Moreover, if knowledge is an achievement, then we should\nexpect it to not require reliability, because no other achievement\nrequires reliability (Turri 2015c). Additionally, recent empirical\nstudies have shown that the ordinary concept of knowledge—which\nis the concept practitioners have claimed to be interested\nin—does not make reliability a necessary condition of knowledge\n(Turri 2016a). For instance, in cases of perceptual and memorial\nbeliefs, people attribute knowledge at similarly high rates (~80%)\nregardless of whether the agent gets it right ten-percent of the time\nor ninety-percent of the time. Along with this line of criticism,\nresearchers have offered an alternative theory of knowledge that\nallows for knowledge produced by even highly unreliable cognitive\nabilities or powers (Turri 2016a,c). \nIn this closing section, we survey four directions in which VE has\ndeveloped. These directions are natural extensions of the ongoing\nresearch programs canvassed above, but they promise to bring new\ninsights into VE and epistemology more generally. These include\nvirtues in epistemic communities, profiles of specific virtues and\nvices, philosophizing about epistemic statuses other than knowledge,\nand explorations of the relations between intellectual virtues and\nepistemic emotions. \nJonathan Kvanvig (1992) argues for an alternative vision of the place\nof virtues in epistemology. Modern epistemology has a narrow Cartesian\nfocus on (time-slices of) individuals and particular beliefs. VE,\nKvanvig says, should not follow suit. It is better suited to focus on\nsocial and historical factors. The virtues are important, on\nKvanvig’s view, because of their indispensable role in training\npeople to seek, acquire and transmit truths—a distinctly social\nactivity (see also Morton 2013). \nTraditional epistemology, Kvanvig says, is dominated by an\n“individualistic” and “synchronic” conception\nof knowledge. It takes its most important job to be specifying the\nconditions under which an individual knows a particular proposition at\na particular time. Kvanvig abandons this in favor of a genetic\nepistemology focused on the cognitive life of the mind as it develops\nwithin a social context. Questions about the group replace questions\nabout the individual. Questions about cognitive development and\nlearning replace questions about what an individual knows at a given\ntime. This approach jibes well with both the educative streak already\nnoted in VE and the embedded, scaffolded, and extended virtue approach\ndescribed in section 9. \nKvanvig sees at least two ways this new approach would feature the\nvirtues. First, virtues are essential to understanding the cognitive\nlife of the mind, particularly development and learning, which happens\nover time through various processes, such as imitating virtuous agents\nand taking to heart cautionary tales of vice. Second, virtues are\nessential in characterizing cognitive ideals. For example, one way of\norganizing information is better than another, Kvanvig argues, because\nin appropriate circumstances that’s how an intellectually\nvirtuous person would organize it. \nAnother “growth area” for VE is profiles of individual\nvirtues and vices. Work in this area has progressed in fits and\nstarts, with a great deal of work on some intellectual virtues and\nvices but less on others. Traits that have received significant\nattention include intellectual courage, intellectual humility,\nepistemic justice, as well as the vices that oppose these virtues. \nRoberts and Wood (2007: 219) characterize intellectual courage and\ncaution as the virtues that dispose us to respond appropriately to\nperceived threats in our intellectual lives—courage disposing us\nto not be unduly intimidated, caution disposing us to not take\ninappropriate risks in achieving intellectual goods. For them, then,\nintellectual courage is analogous to Aristotelian moral courage, in\nthat it disposes its bearer to respond well to threats, being neither\ntoo rash nor too fearful. Baehr (2011, chap. 9) likewise argues that\nintellectual courage is best construed as a disposition to respond\nwell to threats to one’s epistemic well-being; he focuses in\nparticular on the courage to inquire rather than the courage to\nbelieve or doubt. Drawing on Nietzsche, Alfano (2013a) explores a\nrelated kind of intellectual courage to inquire into the forbidden. He\nargues that such Nietzschean courage is needed to understand the most\ndisheartening and shameful aspects of human nature, which people tend\nto whitewash or gloss over. On a different note, Alfano (2013b)\nemphasizes the importance of intellectual courage in publicly\nannouncing what one knows or believes in the face of social and\ninstitutional pressure to conform or be silent. Such courage relates\nto the transmission of knowledge and the destruction of ignorance and\nerror in one’s community rather than the seeking of knowledge\nfor the inquirer’s sake. Having such a sense of when and how to\nspeak one’s mind is a primary constituent of the virtue of being\nan effective whistleblower, an underappreciated exemplar of the\ncurrent era (DesAutels 2009). Medina (2013) offers an account of\nsubjects with exceptional intellectual courage, such as Sor Juana Ines\nde la Cruz in seventeenth century Mexico. Such heroes defy cognitive\nobstacles in contexts of epistemic oppression through inventiveness\nand imagination. \nContributors to the profile of intellectual humility include Carter\nand Pritchard (2016), Hazlett (2012), Roberts and Wood (2007),\nSamuelson and Church (2015), Whitcomb et al. (2015), and Christen et\nal. (2014). Hazlett (2012: 220) claims that intellectual humility is\nthe  \ndisposition not to adopt epistemically improper higher order epistemic\nattitudes, and to adopt (in the right way, in the right situations)\nepistemically proper higher order epistemic attitudes.  \nThis conception of intellectual humility is most pertinent in the\nrealm of disagreement. The view of Roberts and Wood is similar,\nholding that intellectual humility is “a striking or unusual\nunconcern for social importance, and thus a kind of emotional\ninsensitivity to the issues of status” (2007: 239).\nTheir definition, like Hazlett’s, emphasizes the social nature\nof intellectual humility. Unlike Hazlett, Roberts and Wood put more\nweight on the intellectually humble person’s concerns and\nemotions, and less on her doxastic states. \nSamuelson and Church (2015), by contrast, characterize intellectual\nhumility in the dual-process language popular in contemporary\npsychology. Samuelson and Church think that intellectual humility can\nbe implemented as a motivating trait, but they are inclined to\nconstrue it in the dual-system framework, where it harmonizes\nautomatic intuitive processes (heuristics, affective judgments, etc.)\nwith slow, controlled, effortful, attentive thought and\ndeliberation. On this view, someone who tends to jump to conclusions\nbased on intuitions (“System 1”) fails to be\nintellectually humble, especially if he is not open to revising his\nbeliefs in the face of new evidence.  By contrast, someone who forces\nhimself to slow down and think carefully (“System 2”) in\nsituations where intuitive responses are liable to mislead would be a\nparagon of intellectual humility. \nWhitcomb et al. (2015; see also Medina 2013) propose a conception of\nintellectual humility as appropriately attending to and owning\none’s cognitive limitations. Such attentiveness can be\nconscious, but it is grounded in an implicit sensitivity to\none’s own dispositions. Attending to one’s limitations is\nin turn meant to lead to intellectually humble cognitive, behavioral,\nmotivational, and affective responses. This trait leads the\nintellectually humble person to revise her beliefs in light of her\nrecognition of her limitations, to try to overcome or quarantine the\nbad effects of her limitations, to desire to embody fewer and less\nsevere limitations, and to display fitting emotions (e.g., regret\nrather than amusement) towards her limitations. \nFinally, Christen, Alfano, and Robinson (2014) give a descriptive\nrather than a normative account of intellectual humility. Like the\nviews canvassed above, they think that intellectual humility can be\nunderstood as a multifaceted disposition that opposes other\ndispositions. Rather than consulting their own intuitions about what\nthe facets of intellectual humility and its opposing vices are,\nhowever, they employ a thesaurus-based psycholexical analysis, which\nsuggests that intellectual humility has three positive facets (the\nsensitive self, the discreet self, and the inquisitive self) and three\nopposing vices (the underrated other, the underrated self, and the\noverrated self). The sensitive self is characterized by comprehension,\nresponsiveness, and mindfulness—all ways of demonstrating\nopenness to new ideas and information. The inquisitive self is\ncharacterized by curiosity, exploration, and learning—all ways\nof seeking new ideas and information. The discreet self is\ncharacterized by demureness and unpretentiousness—ways of\nrelating to other people, especially those one might disagree\nwith. \nMiranda Fricker (2003, 2007) provides a detailed case study of the\nvirtue of epistemic justice and the opposing vice of “epistemic\ninjustice” suffered by the marginalized and less powerful.\nEpistemic injustice harms someone in their capacity as a (potential)\nknower and comes in several varieties. One species is\nhermeneutical injustice, which occurs when people are denied\nthe conceptual and linguistic resources to make sense of and\ncommunicate their experience. A prime example is sexual harassment, a\nconcept forged 1970s America. The other main species of epistemic\ninjustice that has received by far the most attention, though, is\ntestimonial injustice, which occurs when someone’s\nassertions are accorded less (or more) credence than they deserve\nbecause of prejudice of some kind, such as bias regarding identities\nlike gender, race, ethnicity, or age. The vice of testimonial\ninjustice is a disposition to commit such acts of epistemic injustice.\nThe virtue of corrective testimonial justice is a disposition to\nremain aware of and compensate for your prejudices by interfering with\nyour estimation of the value of someone’s testimony. This\ncorrective virtue, Fricker (2003: 161) argues, is cultivated through\nsocial training. \nMedina (2011, 2012, 2013) has developed a social-contextualist account\nof the virtue of epistemic justice and the corresponding vice of\nepistemic injustice. Medina (2011) argues that testimonial justice\nrequires the development of epistemic sensibility that detects and\ncorrects both undeserved credibility deficits and undeserved\ncredibility excess. \nSherman (2016) agrees with Fricker about the harm caused by\ntestimonial injustice but questions the efficacy of trying to\ncultivate a virtue to correct it. The essential problem is that people\ntend to think that their own opinions and trust in the testimony of\nothers are reasonable. If you thought that you’d given\nsomeone’s word too little weight, you would already have revised\nyour opinion. In light of this, Sherman suggests that efforts to\ncultivate corrective testimonial justice are likely to fail or even\nbackfire. \nFollowing Sherman, Alfano (2015; see also Alfano & Skorburg\nforthcoming) suggests communalizing the pursuit of testimonial justice\nby, for example, recruiting your friends to confront you when they\nthink you’ve committed an act of injustice and going out of your\nway to do the same when you witness injustice. Also in response to\nSherman, Davidson and Kelly (2015) argue that while it may be\ndifficult or impossible to adjust one’s credence in the moment,\ntaking distal ecological control (Clark 2007) over one’s material,\nsocial, and political environment can help to tamp down or eradicate\nthe biases that lead to testimonial injustice. Likewise, Washington\n(2016: 11) argues that because isolated individuals lack a “Bad\nJudgment Alarm”, the response to testimonial injustice should\nnot be to reflexively cultivate one’s own character but to\npromote a “social and moral ecology that facilitates the\nexpression of our values”. These approaches harmonize with the\nembedded, scaffolded, and extended virtue model described above, as\nwell as Kvanvig’s (1992) celebration of the role of the\nepistemic community. \nOther intellectual virtues have received less attention to date,\nthough not for lack of philosophical merit. These include intellectual\ngenerosity (Roberts & Wood 2007: 293), epistemic temperance\n(Battaly 2010), open-mindedness (Adler 2004; Baehr 2011; Carter &\nGordon 2014b),\nintellectual perseverance (King 2014b), inquisitiveness (L. Watson\n2015), and curiosity (Alfano 2013a; Whitcomb 2010). \nAs explained in section 6, practitioners have engaged in a lively\ndiscussion of what the distinctive value of knowledge is. The main\nquestion here has been what makes knowledge more valuable than true\nbelief? Further such value questions might be asked. For instance,\nwhat if anything makes understanding more valuable than knowledge? Or,\nif understanding is a species of knowledge, what if anything makes it\nmore valuable than knowledge that does not qualify as understanding?\nAnd what makes wisdom especially epistemically valuable? \nAnswers to these questions tend to home in on properties either of the\ncontent or of the cognizer. For example, there is a long tradition in\nthe philosophy of science on the nature of scientific explanation. In\nthis tradition, explanations provide understanding by communicating\nknowledge of causes (Lipton 1991; Salmon 1984; Khalifa & Gadomski\n2013; Turri 2015b). By contrast, epistemologists, especially virtue\nepistemologists, have tended to argue that understanding is a special\nstatus that arises from acts of intellectual virtue. For instance,\nPritchard (2016b) argues that understanding arises from “seeing\nit for oneself”, which manifests the virtue of intellectual\nautonomy. Stephen Grimm (2006) argues that understanding is a special\nkind of knowledge that arises from “grasping”, a\ndistinctive psychological act that manifests intellectual virtue.\nCarter and Gordon (2014a,b) argue that objectual understanding, in\nparticular, has a special value knowledge lacks, and further that this\nkind of understanding is needed in order to explain why certain\ntraits, such as open-mindedness, are intellectual virtues. And on\nZagzebski’s view, understanding is closely tied to mastery of an\nart or skill, does not pertain to discrete propositions but to\npatterns or systems, and consequently takes a nonpropositional object.\nUnderstanding does not result from mere acquisition of information, as\ncan propositional knowledge. She thinks of understanding as “the\nstate of comprehension of nonpropositional structures of\nreality” (Zagzebski 2001: 242). She also conjectures that we can\ndefine understanding analogously to how she defined knowledge. The\nmain difference would be in the relevant virtues that produce the\ndifferent states. Whereas knowledge derives from virtues that aim at\ntruth, understanding derives at least partly from different virtues,\nspecial ones hitherto “unanalyzed, even unrecognized”\n(Zagzebski 2001: 248). \nLooking beyond even understanding, Zagzebski further hopes that one\nday epistemologists will turn their attention to wisdom. Further, she\nclaims, VE makes it easier to “recover” interest in and\nanalyze understanding and wisdom. For more on wisdom and its potential\nconnection to the virtue of epistemic humility, see Ryan (2014). \nIt’s uncontroversial to say that many virtues are emotional\ndispositions, even if they involve behavior in addition to emotion. As\nmentioned above, intellectual courage disposes its bearer to\nappropriate fear and confidence in matters epistemic. Alfano (2016b:\nchapter 4) suggests that,\nbecause we are able to individuate emotions more clearly than virtues,\nit might be helpful to index virtues to the emotions they govern. If\nthis is on the right track, then intellectual virtues could be\ndistinguished and structured by cataloguing what Morton (2010; see\nalso Morton 2014, Stocker 2010, and Kashdan & Silvia 2011) calls\nepistemic emotions. These include such states as curiosity,\nfascination, intrigue, hope, trust, distrust, mistrust, surprise,\ndoubt, skepticism, boredom, puzzlement, confusion, wonder, awe, faith,\nand epistemic angst. Note that some of these emotions are referred to\nby words that are also used to refer to their controlling virtues. As\nMorton says, “the words often do triple duty. Character links to\nvirtue links to emotion” (2010). \nVE can benefit from theorizing about epistemic emotions in at least\nthree ways. One benefit of theorizing intellectual virtues via\nepistemic emotions is that doing so furnishes practitioners with a\nsort of “to do list”: many of the virtues related to the\nemotions mentioned in the previous paragraph are unexplored or\nunderexplored. These virtues are ripe for the picking. Another benefit\nof the lens of epistemic emotion is that it helps to make sense of\nintellectual virtues as dispositions to motivated inquiry rather than\njust static belief. Emotions are, after all, motivational states, and\nepistemic emotions in particular direct us to seek confirmation,\ndisconfirmation, and so on. This point is related to but more specific\nthan Michael Brady’s (2013: 92) idea that emotions in general\nmotivate inquiry because they “capture and consume”\nattention, thereby motivating inquiry into their own eliciting\nconditions. For instance, fear captures and consumes the attention of\nthe fearful person, directing him to find and understand the\n(potential) threat or danger. \nFinally, epistemic emotions help to make sense of the motivations and\npractices of scientists. For example, Thagard (2002) mined James\nWatson’s (1969) autobiographical account of the discovery of the\nstructure of DNA for emotion terms; the most common related to\ninterest and the joy of discovery, followed by fear, hope, anger,\ndistress, aesthetic appreciation, and surprise. In addition, the\nliterature on the demarcation between science and pseudo-science,\nalong with the literature on scientific revolutions, is peppered with\nthe language of emotion—especially epistemic emotion. Popper\n(1962) talks of scientists’ attitudes to their hypotheses as one\nof “hope” rather than belief. He distinguishes science\nfrom pseudoscience by sneering at the “faith”\ncharacteristic of the latter and praising the “doubt” and\nopenness to testing of the former. He argues that the “special\nproblem under investigation” and the scientist’s\n“theoretical interests” determine her point of view.\nLakatos (1978) contrasts scientific knowledge with theological\ncertainty that “must be beyond doubt”. Kuhn (1962) says\nthat the attitude scientists have towards their paradigms is one of\nnot only belief but also “trust”. He claims that\nscientists received the discovery of x-rays “not only with\nsurprise but with shock”, going on to say that “though\nthey could not doubt the evidence, [they] were clearly staggered by\nit”. \nIn times of crisis, says Kuhn, scientists are plagued by\n“malaise”. Such malaise has recently become most evident\nin social psychology’s replication crisis. For example, two\npre-registered replications of the so-called “ego-depletion\neffect” recently found that, despite decades of positive studies\nand successful meta-analyses, there appears to be no such effect\n(Hagger et al. 2016; Lurquin et al. 2016). A science journalist\nwriting for Slate magazine described these findings as\n“not just worrying” but “terrifying”, because\nthey suggest that an entire field of research is\n“suspicious” (Engber 2016, see\n Other Internet Resources).\n The article quotes Evan Carter, one of the young scientists in the\nthick of the crisis, saying,  \nAll of a sudden it felt like everything was crumbling. I basically\nlost my compass. Normally I could say, all right there have been 100\npublished studies on this, so I can feel good about it, I can feel\nconfident. And then that just went away.  \nOn his blog, social psychologist Michael Inzlicht (2016, see\n Other Internet Resources)\n writes that despite being  \nin love with social psychology […] I have so many feelings\nabout the situation we’re in, and sometimes the weight of it\nbreaks my heart. […] it is only when we feel badly, when we\nacknowledge and, yes, grieve for yesterday, that we can allow for a\nbetter tomorrow.  \nHe goes on to say, “This is flat-out scary”, and,\n“I’m in a dark place. I feel like the ground is moving\nfrom underneath me and I no longer know what is real and what is\nnot”. Practitioners of VE may be in a position to offer aid and\ncomfort to afflicted scientists, or at least an accurate description\nof what ails them.","contact.mail":"john.turri@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"},{"date.published":"1999-07-09","date.changed":"2017-11-07","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-virtue/","author1":"John Turri","author1.info":"http://john.turri.org/","author2.info":"http://www.tbm.tudelft.nl/en/about-faculty/departments/values-technology-and-innovation/sections/ethicsphilosophy-of-technology/staff/mark-alfano/","entry":"epistemology-virtue","body.text":"\n\n\nContemporary virtue epistemology (hereafter ‘VE’) is a\ndiverse collection of approaches to epistemology. At least two central\ntendencies are discernible among the approaches. First, they view\nepistemology as a normative discipline. Second, they view intellectual\nagents and communities as the primary focus of epistemic evaluation,\nwith a focus on the intellectual virtues and vices embodied in and\nexpressed by these agents and communities.\n\n\nThis entry introduces many of the most important results of the\ncontemporary VE research program. These include novel attempts to\nresolve longstanding disputes, solve perennial problems, grapple with\nnovel challenges, and expand epistemology’s horizons. In the\nprocess, it reveals the diversity within VE. Beyond sharing the two\nunifying commitments mentioned above, its practitioners diverge over\nthe nature of intellectual virtues, which questions to ask, and which\nmethods to use.\n\n\nIt will be helpful to note some terminology before proceeding. First,\nwe use ‘cognitive’, ‘epistemic’ and\n‘intellectual’ synonymously. Second, we often use\n‘normative’ broadly to include not only norms and rules,\nbut also duties and values. Finally, ‘practitioners’ names\ncontemporary virtue epistemologists. \n\nAt least two central tendencies are evident in VE taken as a\nwhole. \nOne central tendency is to view epistemology as a normative\ndiscipline. This implies at least two things. First, it signals\nopposition to Quine’s radical suggestion in “Epistemology\nNaturalized” that philosophers should abandon questions about\nwhat’s reasonable to believe, and should restrict themselves to\nquestions about cognitive psychology instead. Virtue epistemologists\nreject this proposal (McDowell 1994: 133; Sosa 1991: 100–105;\nZagzebski 1996: 334–8). Nevertheless, they are generally\nreceptive to empirical data from psychology, history, and other fields\n(e.g., Greco 2001; Roberts & Wood 2007: Part II; Sosa 1991:\n105–6; Zagzebski 1996: 336–7). Second, it implies that\nepistemologists should focus their efforts on understanding epistemic\nnorms, value, and evaluation. This is a defining feature of the field.\nAccordingly, VE features centrally in the recent “value\nturn” in epistemology (Riggs 2006; Pritchard 2007). \nFor some practitioners, however, the idea that epistemology is a\nnormative discipline means more than this. For example, some think\nthat epistemological terms (or concepts) like ‘knowledge’,\n‘evidence’, ‘justification’,\n‘duty’ and ‘virtue’ cannot be adequately\ndefined or fully explained in purely non-normative vocabulary (e.g.,\nAxtell & Carter 2008; McDowell 1994; Roberts & Wood 2007; and\nZagzebski 1996, 2009), although others disagree (e.g., Goldman 1992;\nGreco 1999, 2009; Sosa 2007). \nOthers think that epistemology should aim to promote intellectual well\nbeing. Perhaps an epistemological theory should be “practically\nuseful” in helping us recognize when we do or don’t know\nsomething (Zagzebski 1996: 267), or help us overcome\n“anxieties” due to defective presuppositions about\nknowledge (McDowell 1994: xi; Pritchard 2016a). Perhaps epistemology\nshould help us appreciate and respond to forms of “epistemic\ninjustice” (Fricker 2007). Perhaps epistemology should inspire\nus with portraits of intellectual virtues, thereby promoting cultural\nreformation and intellectual flourishing (Roberts & Wood 2007).\nPerhaps epistemology should examine intellectual vices and other\ndefects to tell cautionary tales of what not to do and how not to be\n(Alfano 2015, Battaly 2014, Cassam 2016). Or perhaps practitioners\nshould help redesign educational institutions to help students\ncultivate intellectual virtues (e.g., the Intellectual Virtues\nAcademy—see Other Internet Resources). \nThe other central tendency is to view intellectual agents and\ncommunities as the primary source of epistemic value and the primary\nfocus of epistemic evaluation. This focus includes not only\nindividuals and groups, but also the traits constitutive of their\ncognitive character. \nThis second commitment of VE is often accompanied by a\n“direction of analysis” characteristic of virtue theories\nin both ethics and epistemology. Virtue ethics explains an\naction’s moral properties in terms of the agent’s\nproperties, such as whether it results from kindness or spite. VE\nexplains a cognitive performance’s normative properties in terms\nof the cognizer’s properties, such as whether a belief results\nfrom hastiness or excellent eyesight, or whether an inquiry manifests\ncarelessness or discrimination. For virtue ethics the relevant\nproperties are moral traits, and for VE intellectual traits. \nBeyond those basic central tendencies, we find great diversity in the\nfield. Four main issues divide practitioners. The first concerns the\nnature and scope of intellectual virtues (section 3). The second\nconcerns what questions to address (section 4). The third concerns\nwhat methods to use (sections 4 and 9). The fourth concerns the\nrelations among epistemic virtue, knowledge, and epistemic credit\n(sections 5, 6, and 7).  \nPractitioners draw inspiration from many important historical\nphilosophers, including Plato (Zagzebski 1996: 139), Aristotle (Greco\n2002: 311; Sosa 2009: 187; Zagzebski 1996, passim), Aquinas (Roberts\n& Wood 2007: 69–70; Zagzebski 1996, passim), Descartes (Sosa\n2007: ch. 6), Kierkegaard (Roberts & Wood 2007: 29–30),\nNietzsche (Alfano 2013a), and Peirce (Hookway 2000). Hints of VE can\nalso be found in Hume (1748), Reid (1785), Russell (1948), and Sellars\n(1956). Islamic philosophy offers precursors to contemporary virtue\nepistemology, such as discussions of the epistemic value of\nimagination in al-Kindī and al-Fārābī (Adamson\n2015) and Avicenna’s sophisticated social epistemology of\nreliable and unreliable testimony (Black 2013). \nContemporary virtue epistemology, conceived as such and as a\ndistinctive movement within epistemology, began with Ernest\nSosa’s work in the early 1980s (see the papers collected in Sosa\n1991). Sosa applied his “virtue perspectivism” to\nadjudicate disputes in contemporary epistemology, such as the disputes\nbetween foundationalists and coherentists, and between internalists\nand externalists (for a review, see Turri 2013). Other important early\ncontributions were by Lorraine Code (1987), James Montmarquet (1993),\nJonathan Kvanvig (1992), and Linda Zagzebski (1996), who argued that\nSosa’s approach, while promising, did not go far enough in\nidentifying the central role of virtues, such as responsibility or\nconscientiousness, the social and developmental bases of virtues, or\nimportant relationships between intellectual and ethical virtues.\nOther approaches attempt to blend features of Sosa’s initial\napproach and these alternatives (e.g., Greco 1993). It has also been\nargued that early versions of reliabilism are best interpreted as a\nform of VE (Kvanvig 1992). \nStart with an uncontroversial, but still informative, characterization\nof intellectual virtues: intellectual virtues are characteristics that\npromote intellectual flourishing, or which make for an excellent\ncognizer. \nVE is standardly divided up into virtue responsibilists and virtue\nreliabilists (e.g., Axtell 1997), though the aptness of this\ndistinction has come into question (Fleisher 2017). According to this\ntaxonomy, the two camps differ over how to characterize intellectual\nvirtue. Virtue reliabilists (e.g., Goldman, Greco, and Sosa)\nunderstand intellectual virtues to include faculties such as\nperception, intuition, and memory; call these\n‘faculty-virtues’. Their view is best understood as a\ndescendant from earlier externalist epistemologies such as simple\nprocess reliabilism. Virtue responsibilists (e.g., Battaly, Code,\nHookway, Montmarquet, and Zagzebski) understand intellectual virtues\nto include cultivated character traits such as conscientiousness and\nopen-mindedness; call these ‘trait-virtues’. Their\napproach is broadly aligned with internalist sympathies in\nepistemology and deeply concerned with cognition’s ethical\ndimensions and implications. \nThis reliabilist/responsibilist taxonomy has attracted criticism.\nFirst, it is not clear why practitioners need to choose between\nfaculty-virtues and trait-virtues. At first glance, excellent\nperception, good memory, open-mindedness, and intellectual humility\nall seem equally good candidates to promote excellence or flourishing.\nArguments over which are the “real” virtues can seem\npointless and counterproductive, since many are the ways of excelling\nand flourishing intellectually (Battaly 2015). Second, and closely related,\nit is plausible that a complete epistemology must feature both\nfaculty-virtues and trait-virtues. Faculty-virtues seem indispensable\nin accounting for knowledge of the past and the world around us.\nTrait-virtues could be required to account for the full range of\nricher intellectual achievements, such as understanding and wisdom,\nwhich might presuppose knowledge but which arguably also exceed it\n(compare Zagzebski 2001: 248–9). Baehr (2006b) argues that\nvirtue reliabilists should not neglect trait-virtues, because these\nare necessary to explain some cases of knowledge. For instance,\nintellectual courage and perseverance, not just good memory and\nperception, might figure centrally in an explanation of how a knower\narrived at the truth. \nBattaly (2008: 7) provides a helpful list of questions to guide\ninquiry into the nature of intellectual virtue: \nThere are five primary questions that analyses of the intellectual\nvirtues should address. First, are the virtues natural or acquired?\nSecond, does virtue possession require the agent to possess acquired\nintellectually virtuous motivations or dispositions to perform\nintellectually virtuous actions? Third, are the virtues distinct from\nskills? Fourth, are the virtues reliable? Finally, fifth, what makes\nthe virtues valuable? Are they instrumentally, constitutively, or\nintrinsically valuable? \nJason Kawall (2002) calls attention to a set of virtues neglected by\nvirtue epistemologists of all stripes. Virtue ethicists have long\nrecognized a difference between self-regarding moral virtues, such as\nprudence and courage, and other-regarding virtues, such as benevolence\nand compassion. And they have recognized the importance of both\nsorts. But virtue epistemologists have overlooked a similar\ndistinction among intellectual virtues. They focus on self-regarding\nintellectual virtues, such as perceptual acuity or intellectual\ncourage, which promote the individual’s own intellectual\nflourishing. They neglect other-regarding intellectual virtues, such\nas honesty and integrity, which promote other people’s\nacquisition of knowledge and intellectual flourishing. More complex\nother-regarding virtues would involve a willingness and ability to\narticulately communicate one’s reasons to others, or the\ncreativity to discover knowledge new to a community. “An\nepistemic agent who focuses exclusively on self-regarding epistemic\nvirtues”, Kawall (2002: 260) writes, “could be a deficient\nepistemic agent to the extent that she is a member of a\ncommunity”. Such attention to the cognitive agent’s\nepistemic community also informs research on epistemic justice and\ninjustice (Fricker 2007, Sherman 2016) and recent explorations of\nembedded, scaffolded, and extended intellectual character (Alfano\n2013b, 2014b; Alfano & Skorburg 2017, forthcoming), topics to\nwhich we return in section 9. \nDisagreements about the nature of virtue are closely connected to\nanother pair of disagreements. These disagreements concern which\nquestions and methods should feature in epistemology. \nMany practitioners deploy VE’s resources to address standard\nquestions in standard ways. (Here ‘standard’ means\n‘standard for contemporary Anglo-American epistemology’.)\nThey offer analyses or definitions of knowledge and justification.\nThey try to solve puzzles and problems, such as the Gettier problem\nand the lottery problem. They construct counterexamples. They confront\nthe skeptic. This is conventional VE. \nOther practitioners address alternative questions or use alternative\nmethods. They shun definitions and tidy analyses. They focus on topics\nother than knowledge and justification, such as deliberation, inquiry,\nunderstanding, wisdom, profiles of individual virtues and vices,\nexaminations of the relations among distinct virtues and vices, and\nthe social, ethical, and political dimensions of cognition. They\nignore the radical skeptic. They mine literature and drama for\ninspiration and examples. This is alternative VE. \nAn example of conventional VE is Ernest Sosa’s (1991: section\nIV) attempt to define knowledge as true belief held “out of\nintellectual virtue”, or to settle the dispute among\ninternalists and externalists about epistemic justification (Sosa\n2003: ch. 9), providing detailed definitions and carefully trying to\ndisarm counterexamples. Another prime example of conventional VE is\nLinda Zagzebski’s (1996: part III) definition of knowledge and\nattempted resolution of the Gettier problem. \nAn example of extreme alternative VE is Robert Roberts and Jay\nWood’s (2007) view that conventional questions and methods have\neviscerated epistemology, and that we should instead aim to reform\nintellectual culture by sketching subtle and nuanced pictures\n(“maps”) of the intellectual virtues, drawing freely on\nliterature, history, and scripture. Another example is Jonathan\nKvanvig’s (1992) argument that VE will flourish only by\nrelinquishing the Cartesian epistemological project and instead\nfocusing on the role virtues play in training and education. Others\nhave argued that the kernel of truth in VE is best developed in an\ninterdisciplinary context drawing on the methods and findings of the\ncognitive, social, and life sciences (Turri 2015a). \nThe foregoing does not imply that VE is a house divided against\nitself. On the contrary, we find a spectrum of conventional and\nalternative approaches rather than a simple dichotomy, and among\nvarious practitioners we often see a “live and let live”\nattitude. Thus while some practitioners of alternative VE counsel a\nradical, wholesale break from conventional questions or methods, most\neither blend conventional and alternative elements (e.g., Zagzebski,\nRiggs, Battaly), or see value in conventional VE (e.g., Baehr 2011).\nConventional practitioners likewise recognize that\n“alternative” questions are not only important but as old\nas philosophy itself, such as questions about wisdom and the social\ntransmission of virtues. The same goes for the\n“alternative” methods of consulting literature, as Plato\nlooked to Homer, approaching philosophical questions with scientific\ntools, as Aristotle inquired into the biological and social bases of\ncognition, and referring to scripture, as the Islamic philosophical\ntradition did in relation to the norms of testimony. \nMany virtue epistemologists agree that, in very general terms,\nknowledge is non-accidentally true belief. Different theories spell\nout “non-accidentally” differently, but among many\npractitioners a common understanding of that key term seems to have\nemerged. Simply put, to know is to believe the truth because of your\nintellectual virtue (e.g., Sosa 1991: 277; Zagzebski 1996:\n271–2, Riggs 2002: 93–4; Lehrer 2000: 223; Greco 2003:\n111; Turri 2011). \nOne benefit claimed for this basic approach is that it provides an\nintuitive account of why knowledge is inconsistent with luck of a\ncertain sort. For instance, some begin with the intuitive thought that\nyou don’t know something if it is “largely a matter of\nluck” that you believe it (Riggs 2007). But why does knowledge\npreclude luck in this way? In the first detailed attempt to answer\nthis question, Wayne Riggs says that the opposition between knowledge\nand luck is best explained by the hypothesis that knowledge is\n“an achievement for which the knower deserves credit”\n(Riggs 2009: 341). And knowers deserve credit because they believe the\ntruth because of their virtue (Greco 2003). In response, some have\nargued that luck and virtue are orthogonal dimensions of epistemic\nevaluation (Pritchard 2012), and that knowledge must be due to virtue\nmore than luck, as opposed to virtue rather than\nluck (Carter 2014). \nA related benefit of the basic approach is that, in the eyes of many\npractitioners, it solves the Gettier problem. Gettier cases follow a\nrecipe. Start with a belief sufficiently justified to meet the\njustification condition for knowledge. Then add an element of bad luck\nthat would normally prevent the justified belief from being true.\nLastly add a dose of good luck that “cancels out the bad”,\nso the belief ends up true anyhow. It has proven difficult to explain\nwhy this “double luck” prevents knowledge (Zagzebski\n1996). \nHere is a Gettier case (adapted from Zagzebski 1996: 285–6).\nMary enters the house and looks into the living room. A familiar\nappearance greets her from her husband’s chair. She thinks,\n“My husband is sitting in the living room”, and then walks\ninto the den. But Mary misidentified the man in the chair. It is not\nher husband, but his brother, whom she had no reason to believe was\neven in the country. However, her husband was seated along the\nopposite wall of the living room, out of Mary’s sight, dozing in\na different chair. \nThe VE solution to the Gettier problem is that knowledge requires you\nto believe the truth “because of” your intellectual\nvirtues, but Gettier subjects do not believe the truth because of\ntheir virtues, so they do not know (Zagzebski 1996: 285 ff; Greco\n2003; Sosa 2007: ch. 5; Turri 2011). Some critics complain that this\nview is uninformative because we lack an adequate understanding of\nwhat it is to believe “because of” or “out of”\nvirtue (e.g., Roberts & Wood 2007). Other critics argue that the\nbasic approach still suffers from counterexamples (e.g., Baehr 2006a;\nChurch 2013). \nRecently, leading practitioners have touted the fact that VE places\nknowledge in a familiar pattern. On this approach, epistemic\nevaluation is just another example of the basic way in which we\nevaluate all behavior and performances. The most widely discussed\narticulation of this view is Ernest Sosa’s AAA–model of\nperformance assessment (Sosa 2007: 22–3; for related but subtly\ndifferent approaches, see Greco 2003 & 2010 and Morton 2013). On\nthis approach, we can assess performances for accuracy, adroitness,\nand aptness. Accurate performances achieve their aim, adroit\nperformances manifest competence, and apt performances are accurate\nbecause adroit. This AAA-model applies to all conduct and performances\nwith an aim, whether intentional (as in ballet) or unintentional (as\nwith a heartbeat). \nHere’s how the model applies in epistemology. (A more\ncomplicated model has lately been proposed, which takes into account\nthe agent’s own risk-assessment and decisions about when and how\nto perform; see Sosa 2015.) Belief-formation is a psychological\nperformance with an aim. For beliefs, accuracy is identified with\ntruth, adroitness with manifesting intellectual competence, and\naptness with being “true because competent”. Apt belief,\nthen, is belief that is true because competent. A competence, in\nturn,  \nis a disposition, one with a basis resident in the competent agent,\none that would in appropriately normal conditions ensure (or make\nhighly likely) the success of any relevant performance issued by it.\n(Sosa 2007: 29)  \nKnowledge is then identified with apt belief, which is just “a\nspecial case” of “creditable, apt performance”, a\nstatus common across the gamut of human activities. \nConsider the performance of an archer who hits a bullseye because she\nshoots competently. Her shot is apt, and her bullseye an achievement.\nIt’s possible that she might easily have missed. She might have\nluckily avoided being drugged before the competition, which would have\nimpaired her competence. Or a strong gust of wind, which would have\nruined her shot, might have just been avoided by a rare confluence of\nlocal meteorological conditions. In any of these ways, her performance\nmight have been apt even though there are nearby possible worlds in\nwhich she does not hit the bullseye. Sosa (2007: 31) says that\nknowledge is also like this: in some cases you might believe aptly,\nand thus know, even though you might easily have been wrong.  Some have argued that this feature of Sosa’s view opens it\nup to counterexamples. For example, Duncan Pritchard (2009a), echoing\nJennifer Lackey’s (2007) broader criticism of credit views of\nknowledge, argues that Sosa’s view gives the wrong verdict in\nthe fake-barn thought experiment (originally due to Carl Ginet; see\nGoldman 1976: 772–3). In this thought experiment, Henry and his\nson are driving through the country.  Henry pulls over to stretch his\nlegs, and while doing so regales his son with a list of currently\nvisible roadside items.  “That’s a tractor. That’s a\ncombine. That’s a horse. That’s a silo. And that’s a\nfine barn”, he adds, pointing to the nearby roadside barn. But\nunbeknownst to them, the locals recently secretly replaced nearly\nevery barn in the country with fake barns (they’re in\n“Fake Barn Country”).  Henry happens to see the one real\nbarn in the whole county. Had he instead set eyes on any of the\nnumerous nearby fakes, he would have falsely believed it was a\nbarn. \nHenry has a true belief because of his perceptual acuity, Pritchard\nsays, so it counts as apt and Sosa’s view entails that Henry\nknows. But, Pritchard claims, it’s obvious that Henry\ndoesn’t know. Pritchard (2008a: 445) raises an exactly similar\nobjection to Greco’s theory of knowledge. Criticism on this\npoint has come on two fronts. On the one hand, some epistemologists\nhave argued that (contra Pritchard) fake-barn-style cases, which\nfeature environmental luck, are not cases of apt belief or cognitive\nachievement (e.g., Jarvis 2013; Littlejohn 2014). On the other hand,\nsome reject the claim that the agent doesn’t know in this case\nor structurally similar ones (e.g., Lycan 2006; Turri 2011). Moreover,\nrecent experimental work has shown that non-philosophers\noverwhelmingly view fake-barn cases, and structurally similar ones, as\ninstances of knowledge (Colaço, Buckwalter, Stich & Machery\n2014; Turri, Buckwalter, & Blouw 2014; Turri 2016c). \nWhat is the nature of epistemic value and how is knowledge\ndistinctively epistemically valuable? In particular, why is knowledge\nmore valuable than mere true belief, especially if true belief serves\njust as well for guiding action? Such questions have occupied center\nstage in recent epistemology and date back at least to Plato’s\nMeno (see Pritchard & Turri 2014 for an overview). Many\nvirtue epistemologists think that their approach is uniquely suited to\nprovide satisfying answers to these questions. \nZagzebski (2003) argues that an adequate account of knowledge must\nexplain why knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief. This is\nknown as “the value problem”. VE is well positioned to\nsolve it, she argues, because the correct solution must help us see\nhow knowledge possesses value independently of anything\n“external” to its production. A good cup of coffee is not\nbetter simply because it was made by a good, reliable coffee machine.\nLikewise a true belief is not made better simply because it was formed\nby a reliable method. The added value must come from something\n“internal” to it. The solution is to view knowledge as a\ncredit-worthy state of the agent, produced or sustained by her\nvirtuous agency. \nGreco (2009, 2012)\nand Sosa (2003, 2007) contend that knowledge is a kind of\nachievement—intellectual success through ability, for which the\nknower is creditable. And in general, success through virtue is more\nvaluable than mere success, especially accidental success. So\nknowledge is more valuable than true belief. Riggs (2009: 342) puts\nthe point succinctly:  \nThe reason that credit-worthiness views of knowledge can solve the\nvalue problem is that they introduce a new vector of value:\ncredit…. If knowing that p always entails that one\ndeserves credit for having achieved a true belief, then this\nintroduces something besides true belief that is valuable  \n(Riggs 1998 & 2002 offer the same basic argument.) Carter, Jarvis\nand Rubin (2015) propose a taxonomy of varieties of cognitive\nachievement based on the relative weights given to achieving success\nversus avoiding failure; for example, having a suspicion that p\nis a cognitive attempt that puts more weight on achieving success,\nwhereas Cartesian certainty that p is a cognitive attempt to\nputs almost exclusive weight on avoiding failure. \nAristotle made a related distinction between achieving some end by\nluck or accident, and achieving it through the exercise of one’s\nabilities or virtues. It is only the latter kind of action, he argues,\nthat is both intrinsically valuable and constitutive of human\nflourishing. “Human good”, he writes, “turns out to\nbe activity of soul exhibiting excellence” (Nicomachean\nEthics 1098a15-16; translation by W. D. Ross 1984, p. 1735). The\nsuccessful exercise of one’s intellectual virtues is both\nintrinsically good and constitutive of human flourishing. This\npertains to moral and intellectual virtue. Assuming the basic VE line\non knowledge is correct, we get a straightforward solution to the\nvalue problem. \nAs we reviewed in the sections on knowledge and epistemic value, a\nvery popular thesis in VE is that knowledge is a credit-worthy state\nof the agent. You know only if you deserve credit for believing the\ntruth. Call this “the credit thesis”. The credit thesis\nhelps explain knowledge’s value. It also features prominently in\nattempts to resolve the Gettier problem and explain epistemic\nluck. \nJennifer Lackey (2007) argues that we do not deserve credit for\neverything we know, so (a) standard VE definitions of knowledge are\nfalse, and (b) VE is not ideally suited to explain knowledge’s\nvalue. She presents counterexamples involving testimonial and innate\nknowledge. On Lackey’s understanding, to earn credit for a true\nbelief, your “reliable cognitive faculties” must be\n“the most salient part” of the explanation for why you\nbelieve the truth (Lackey 2007: 351; see also Greco 2003: 130).\nCognitive faculties cannot be merely necessary or important parts of\nthe explanation, she argues, because then Gettier problems would\nimmediately arise (Lackey 2007: 347–8). \nHere is a close variant of one of Lackey’s cases (Lackey 2007:\n352), which she later (2009) calls “Chicago Visitor”:\nMorris just arrived at the Chicago train station and wants directions\nto the Sears Tower. He approaches the first adult passerby he sees\n(“Passerby”) and asks for directions. Passerby knows the\ncity extraordinarily well and articulately offers impeccable\ndirections: the tower is two blocks east of the station. On that basis\nMorris unhesitatingly forms the corresponding true belief. \nLackey reasons as follows. Morris clearly gains knowledge of the\ntower’s location. But Passerby’s contribution is most\nsalient in explaining why Morris learned the truth. Morris’s\ncontribution to the process is minimal. Morris’s reliable\ncognitive faculties are not the most salient part of the explanation\nfor why he believes the truth. So he doesn’t deserve credit. But\nhe knows nonetheless. So the credit thesis is false. \nLackey also asks us to consider “the possibility of natural\ninnate knowledge” (Lackey 2007: 358). Surely such knowledge is\npossible, so an adequate theory of knowledge must accommodate the\npossibility. But “it seems highly unlikely that a subject would\ndeserve credit for such knowledge”. For the belief’s\norigin, “such as natural selection or some other evolutionary\nmechanism”, would be the most salient part of the explanation\nfor why you had the true belief. So the credit thesis is false. \nGreco (2007) responds that Morris still deserves credit for learning\nthe truth. Credit for cooperative success can accrue to multiple\nindividuals, even ones who contribute less than others. It generally\nrequires only that your “efforts and abilities” be\n“appropriately involved” in the success (Greco 2007: 65).\nSuppose we’re playing ice hockey and you make an extraordinarily\nbrilliant play to set me up for a goal. The goalie prostrate outside\nhis crease, the defensemen dizzy and confused behind the net, I simply\ntap the puck in. Your contribution dwarfs mine, but I still deserve\ncredit for the goal. Likewise, Passerby does most of the work, yet\nMorris still gets credit because his intellectual abilities were\nappropriately involved. Examples like this highlight the difficulty of\ndividing responsibility for cooperative achievements as if it should\nsum to 100 percent. The individualism presupposed by this summative\nassumption is challenged by recent arguments for embedded, scaffolded,\nand extended knowledge (see section 9). \nSosa (2007: 95) responds that Morris still deserves “partial\ncredit”, even though his success in believing the truth is\nprimarily attributable to a “socially seated competence”\nembodied in the people involved in the testimonial chain. This\nsuffices for his belief to be apt, and thus count as knowledge.\nPartial credit grounded in apt performance is a perfectly general\nphenomenon, as common in team sport as in testimony.  \nThe quarterback’s pass derives from his competence, but its\ngreat success, its being a touchdown pass manifests more\nfully the team’s competence. \nRiggs (2009: 209) responds that it isn’t clear that Morris does\nknow where the tower is. We aren’t compelled to count as\nknowledge every “casual, unreflective acceptance of\ntestimony” (Riggs 2009: 214). And notice that if we continue the\nstory by having someone soon afterward ask Morris where the tower is,\nhe’d be out of line to simply assert, “It’s two\nblocks that way”, which suggests that he doesn’t really\nknow after all (Riggs 2009: 210–11). Beyond that, Riggs\ndistinguishes two senses of credit: praiseworthiness and\nattributability. Knowledge requires that your true belief be\nattributable to you as an agent, but not that you be praiseworthy for\nit. Riggs claims that Lackey’s objections wrongly suppose that\ndefenders of the credit thesis think that knowledge requires\npraiseworthiness, are too closely tied to Greco’s particular\naccount of credit (with its emphasis on explanatory salience), and\nalso overlook the possibility of “group effort” in\nachievements. \nLackey (2009) replies to Greco, Riggs, and Sosa. Her response is\nsubtle and multidimensional, but its centerpiece is a dilemma for\nVE’s credit thesis. Either VE’s notion of creditworthiness\nis substantial enough to rule out credit for Gettier subjects or it\nisn’t. If it is substantial enough, then it rules out too much\ntestimonial knowledge, in which case it fails. If it isn’t\nsubstantial enough, then it suffers refutation by Gettier cases, in\nwhich case it still fails. Either way, it fails. (Compare Kvanvig\n2003; Pritchard 2008b.) \nAccording to a widely debated view in recent epistemology,\ncontextualism, the truth conditions for knowledge attributions such as\n“S knows that P” are context-sensitive, due to the\ncontext-sensitivity of the cognitive verb “know” (for a\nreview, see Rysiew 2016).  Contextualists disagree over how to model\nthe alleged context-sensitivity. Some say “know” is an\nindexical possessing a context-invariant character that is a function\nfrom contexts to contents (Cohen 2013). Others claim that\n“knows” is a vague predicate in need of contextual\nsupplementation to predicate a determinate property (Heller\n1999). Critics argue that leading contextualist proposals are ad hoc\nor unmotivated because we lack independent evidence that\n“knows” is context-sensitive in these ways (Stanley 2005),\nor because behavioral experiments demonstrate that people do not\nevaluate knowledge attributions in the way that leading contextualists\nhave assumed or predicted (Turri 2016b). \nGreco (2004, 2008) defends a version of contextualism, what he calls\n“virtue contextualism”. Virtue contextualism emerges from\nthe basic idea, mentioned above, that to know is to believe the truth\nbecause of your intellectual virtue or ability. When we say\n“because of your intellectual virtue or ability”, how are\nwe to understand “because”? In general, explanatory talk\nis context-sensitive. It is context-sensitive in two primary ways.\nFirst, abnormal features tend to be explanatorily salient.\nThere’s a panic in a Manhattan apartment building, which happens\nvery soon after a tiger wanders into the lobby. We have no trouble\nidentifying the panic’s cause: the tiger. That’s true even\nthough the tiger’s presence isn’t individually sufficient\nto cause a panic—people must also fear tigers, but they normally\ndo. Second, our interests and purposes single out certain features as\nespecially relevant. We tend to focus on things we can control. If a\nstudent asks a teacher why he failed the exam, the teacher might point\nout that he rarely came to class and didn’t pick up a study\nguide until the morning of the exam. \nIf explanatory talk is generally context-sensitive, and knowledge-talk\nis just a species of explanatory-talk, then perhaps\nknowledge-attributions are too. By changing what seems normal or by\nchanging our interests and purpose, we might go from a context where\nsaying “S believes the truth because of her virtue”\nexpresses a truth, to a context where uttering the same words\nexpresses a falsehood. And since saying “S knows” is\ntantamount to saying “S believes the truth because of her\nvirtue”, it follows that knowledge-attributions are likewise\ncontext-sensitive. By deriving its account of context-sensitivity from\nthe general character of explanatory-talk, virtue contextualism might\navoid the charge that it is unmotivated and ad hoc. However, further\nwork is required to test whether the theory fits with people’s\nactual linguistic behavior. \nAs mentioned above, practitioners of all stripes tend to recognize the\nimportance of empirical findings about cognition and inquiry. There\nare multiple reasons for this sensitivity beyond a predilection for\nnaturalism. First, even though VE is a normative discipline as\ndiscussed above, some practitioners accept a version of the ought\nimplies can principle. To the extent that empirical research in\npsychology, cognitive science, and other fields delineates the limits\nof human cognition, such research constrains the inquiries,\ndispositions, and states that can be epistemically demanded of people.\nMore ambitiously, one might think that extremely demanding epistemic\nnorms are sometimes inappropriate even if, strictly speaking, they can\nbe satisfied. Second, even if one rejects ought implies can,\nan alleged strength of VE is its ability to respond successfully to\nskepticism. However, if the dispositions practitioners assume to exist\nare never or rarely embodied by humans, then skepticism looms. Note\nthat this argument goes through even if people could acquire and\nmanifest epistemic virtues, just so long as they in fact don’t.\nThird, empirical research may help to solve the generality\nproblem. Any episode of acquiring a belief can be classed under\nan indefinite number of headings; some such classifications\nindividuate highly reliable dispositions, while others individuate\nless reliable dispositions. When I infer from the fact that every\nemerald I’ve examined is green that every emerald (whether\nexamined or not) is green, should my inference be described as\ninductive generalization or inductive generalization\nemploying projectable predicates? Though the generality problem\nwas first articulated as a hurdle for process reliabilism (Pollock\n1984), Goldman (1986: 50) and Zagzebski (1996: 300) recognize that VE\nfaces its own version of the problem. Should epistemic virtues be\ncoarsely individuated, so that open-mindedness makes the cut,\nor should they be finely individuated, so that open-mindedness\ntowards friends while in a good mood makes the cut? Zagzebski\n(1996: 309) argues that this question should be answered empirically,\nwith a preference for coarse individuation. Finally, practitioners who\nfavor an ameliorative or educative approach to VE have an additional\nreason to attend to empirical findings, because these may reveal\ncommon cognitive defects that could potentially be set right, as well\nas suggesting more promising prospects for cognitive and epistemic\ntraining and development than those employed in contemporary\npedagogy. \nThese considerations notwithstanding, the cognitive sciences might\npose a threat to VE. After all, to the extent that people’s\ncognitive dispositions do not qualify as virtues (because they are\nunreliable or irresponsible, for example), the true beliefs they\nproduce will not count as knowledge (Alfano 2012). Recall that\npractitioners are largely in agreement that knowledge is true belief\nthat manifests virtue. If empirical studies suggest that\npeople’s beliefs usually manifest cognitive defects or\nincompetence, then VE would be led to the conclusion that most of our\ntrue beliefs don’t count as knowledge. This challenge to VE is\nanalogous to the “situationist challenge” to virtue ethics\n(Doris 1998, 2002; Flanagan 1991; Harman 1999; for a recent\narticulation, see Merritt, Doris, and Harman 2010). \nMark Alfano (2012: 234) first framed the problem as an inconsistent\ntriad: anti-skepticism, according to which almost all humans\nhave quite a bit of knowledge, epistemic situationism,\naccording to which most people’s intellectual dispositions are\nnot virtues because they are highly sensitive to seemingly trivial and\nepistemically irrelevant situational factors, and VE. Regarding the\nreliability of people’s inferential dispositions, Alfano (2014a,\n2013b: chapter 6) pointed to a robust series of findings related to\nthe unreliability of heuristics such as the availability heuristic,\nthe representativeness heuristic, and the recognition heuristic.\nRegarding responsibilist VE, Alfano (2012, 2013b: chapter 5)\nemphasized findings on the substantial influence of seemingly trivial\nbut epistemically irrelevant factors on belief-formation. These\nfactors include mood elevators, mood depressors, and social cues of\nunanimous versus non-unanimous agreement. Subsequently, while a few\nphilosophers have twisted the empirical knife further (e.g., Olin and\nDoris 2014; Blumenthal-Barby 2015), at least four lines of response\nhave emerged. \nThe first main response to epistemic situationism is to deny that\nthere is a problem, referring to more heartening empirical evidence.\nFor example, Fairweather and Montemayor (2014) argue that\nheuristics—instead of being unreliable mental\nshortcuts—are more reliable than traditional inferential\npatterns that people tend to misuse. In a similar vein, Samuelson and\nChurch (2015) argue that heuristics, when properly monitored and\ninterrupted by top-down effortful cognition, can be reliable, and that\neffective exercise of such top-down control constitutes a version of\nthe responsibilist virtue of intellectual humility. And King (2014a)\ndefends responsibilism by pointing out that, at least on\nZagzebski’s (1996) version of VE, knowledge needn’t\nmanifest virtue but instead needs only to arise from the sort of\nmotivated inquiry that a virtuous person would engage in. \nThe second main response is more conciliatory, suggesting that VE\nshould focus less on achieving virtue and more on avoiding vice.\nRoberts and West (2015) contend that research on heuristics and\nrelated cognitive biases shows that humans are best understood as\nmanifesting various natural epistemic defects. The work of becoming a\ngood-enough cognizer is then a matter of cultivating ways of avoiding\nor overcoming these defects.  They suggest that self-vigilance and\nincreased intellectual vitality are two key ways to handle these\ndefects, making their view somewhat similar to that of Samuelson and\nChurch (2015). Cassam (2016) argues that the extensive literature on\nconspiracy theories and conspiratorial thinking shows that people are\nprone to various intellectual vices, understood as character traits\nthat impede effective and responsible inquiry. Understanding human\ninquiry and how it is liable to go wrong thus requires a study of\nintellectual vices.  Alfano (2014b) explores the phenomenon of\nstereotype threat from the perspective of intellectual vice, arguing\nthat susceptibility to stereotype threat should be construed as an\nepistemic defect for which the social environment, rather than the\nagent, is responsible. This suggests that overcoming at least some\nepistemic vices requires a social or institutional approach. \nThis suggestion is in line with the third main response to epistemic\nsituationism, which is to somehow offload some of the cognitive agency\ntraditionally required of the individual onto the material, social, or\npolitical environment. For instance, Pritchard (2014) argues for a\nmore modest version of VE that countenances the essential role of the\nenvironment in the acquisition of knowledge. Someone who is luckily\nplaced in their material, social, and political environment will end\nup with more knowledge despite less exercise of cognitive agency than\nsomeone who is unluckily placed, even if the latter exercises heroic\nlevels of cognitive agency. Epistemic situationism is thus\nreinterpreted as evidence for our inescapable epistemic dependence on\ncircumstance. Alfano (2013b, 2016a) and Alfano and Skorburg (2017,\nforthcoming) connect the challenge of epistemic situationism with the\nliterature in the philosophy of mind on embedded, scaffolded, and\nextended cognition inspired by Clark and Chalmers (1998; see also\nSterelny 2010). The basic idea here is that when a cognitive agent is\nsuitably integrated with natural objects, artifacts, and other agents\nin their material, social, and political environment, those externalia\nmay be partially constitutive of the agent’s cognitive\ndispositions. Embedded cognition occurs in a mostly-stable natural\nenvironment; scaffolded cognition occurs in a mostly-stable artificial\nenvironment; outright extended cognition occurs in a\ndynamically-reactive environment. Within this taxonomy, Alfano and\nSkorburg (forthcoming) argue that it is possible to improve the\nreliability of the recognition heuristic not by developing further\ninternal cognitive resources (as Samuelson & Church 2015 and\nRoberts & West 2015 would have it) but by better structuring the\ninformational ecosystem in which people find themselves—a\nsuggestion that harmonizes with recent work on the epistemology of\ninformation and communication technologies such as the Internet\n(Bozdag & van den Hoven 2015; Lynch 2016) and library sciences\n(Fallis & Whitcomb 2009). Alfano (2016a) and Alfano and Skorburg\n(2017) argue that, in some cases, pairs of agents mutually constitute\neach other’s character by engaging in dynamic interactions with\ninterlocking virtues. One example they focus on is friendship, where\nmy being your friend is partly constituted by your being my friend,\nand vice versa. The literature on embedded, scaffolded, and extended\nepistemic virtues is a natural development of VE’s emphasis on\nintellectual agents and communities. \nA fourth response is that there is no evidence that knowledge requires\nthe sort of dispositions that epistemic situationism challenges and,\nmoreover, that there is theoretical and empirical evidence that\nknowledge does not require such dispositions (Turri 2017). More\nspecifically, according to this line of criticism, no serious argument\nhas ever been provided that knowledge requires reliability; instead,\nphilosophers have relied on weak explanatory arguments or, more\ncommonly, simply assumed that knowledge requires reliability (Turri\n2016a). Moreover, if knowledge is an achievement, then we should\nexpect it to not require reliability, because no other achievement\nrequires reliability (Turri 2015c). Additionally, recent empirical\nstudies have shown that the ordinary concept of knowledge—which\nis the concept practitioners have claimed to be interested\nin—does not make reliability a necessary condition of knowledge\n(Turri 2016a). For instance, in cases of perceptual and memorial\nbeliefs, people attribute knowledge at similarly high rates (~80%)\nregardless of whether the agent gets it right ten-percent of the time\nor ninety-percent of the time. Along with this line of criticism,\nresearchers have offered an alternative theory of knowledge that\nallows for knowledge produced by even highly unreliable cognitive\nabilities or powers (Turri 2016a,c). \nIn this closing section, we survey four directions in which VE has\ndeveloped. These directions are natural extensions of the ongoing\nresearch programs canvassed above, but they promise to bring new\ninsights into VE and epistemology more generally. These include\nvirtues in epistemic communities, profiles of specific virtues and\nvices, philosophizing about epistemic statuses other than knowledge,\nand explorations of the relations between intellectual virtues and\nepistemic emotions. \nJonathan Kvanvig (1992) argues for an alternative vision of the place\nof virtues in epistemology. Modern epistemology has a narrow Cartesian\nfocus on (time-slices of) individuals and particular beliefs. VE,\nKvanvig says, should not follow suit. It is better suited to focus on\nsocial and historical factors. The virtues are important, on\nKvanvig’s view, because of their indispensable role in training\npeople to seek, acquire and transmit truths—a distinctly social\nactivity (see also Morton 2013). \nTraditional epistemology, Kvanvig says, is dominated by an\n“individualistic” and “synchronic” conception\nof knowledge. It takes its most important job to be specifying the\nconditions under which an individual knows a particular proposition at\na particular time. Kvanvig abandons this in favor of a genetic\nepistemology focused on the cognitive life of the mind as it develops\nwithin a social context. Questions about the group replace questions\nabout the individual. Questions about cognitive development and\nlearning replace questions about what an individual knows at a given\ntime. This approach jibes well with both the educative streak already\nnoted in VE and the embedded, scaffolded, and extended virtue approach\ndescribed in section 9. \nKvanvig sees at least two ways this new approach would feature the\nvirtues. First, virtues are essential to understanding the cognitive\nlife of the mind, particularly development and learning, which happens\nover time through various processes, such as imitating virtuous agents\nand taking to heart cautionary tales of vice. Second, virtues are\nessential in characterizing cognitive ideals. For example, one way of\norganizing information is better than another, Kvanvig argues, because\nin appropriate circumstances that’s how an intellectually\nvirtuous person would organize it. \nAnother “growth area” for VE is profiles of individual\nvirtues and vices. Work in this area has progressed in fits and\nstarts, with a great deal of work on some intellectual virtues and\nvices but less on others. Traits that have received significant\nattention include intellectual courage, intellectual humility,\nepistemic justice, as well as the vices that oppose these virtues. \nRoberts and Wood (2007: 219) characterize intellectual courage and\ncaution as the virtues that dispose us to respond appropriately to\nperceived threats in our intellectual lives—courage disposing us\nto not be unduly intimidated, caution disposing us to not take\ninappropriate risks in achieving intellectual goods. For them, then,\nintellectual courage is analogous to Aristotelian moral courage, in\nthat it disposes its bearer to respond well to threats, being neither\ntoo rash nor too fearful. Baehr (2011, chap. 9) likewise argues that\nintellectual courage is best construed as a disposition to respond\nwell to threats to one’s epistemic well-being; he focuses in\nparticular on the courage to inquire rather than the courage to\nbelieve or doubt. Drawing on Nietzsche, Alfano (2013a) explores a\nrelated kind of intellectual courage to inquire into the forbidden. He\nargues that such Nietzschean courage is needed to understand the most\ndisheartening and shameful aspects of human nature, which people tend\nto whitewash or gloss over. On a different note, Alfano (2013b)\nemphasizes the importance of intellectual courage in publicly\nannouncing what one knows or believes in the face of social and\ninstitutional pressure to conform or be silent. Such courage relates\nto the transmission of knowledge and the destruction of ignorance and\nerror in one’s community rather than the seeking of knowledge\nfor the inquirer’s sake. Having such a sense of when and how to\nspeak one’s mind is a primary constituent of the virtue of being\nan effective whistleblower, an underappreciated exemplar of the\ncurrent era (DesAutels 2009). Medina (2013) offers an account of\nsubjects with exceptional intellectual courage, such as Sor Juana Ines\nde la Cruz in seventeenth century Mexico. Such heroes defy cognitive\nobstacles in contexts of epistemic oppression through inventiveness\nand imagination. \nContributors to the profile of intellectual humility include Carter\nand Pritchard (2016), Hazlett (2012), Roberts and Wood (2007),\nSamuelson and Church (2015), Whitcomb et al. (2015), and Christen et\nal. (2014). Hazlett (2012: 220) claims that intellectual humility is\nthe  \ndisposition not to adopt epistemically improper higher order epistemic\nattitudes, and to adopt (in the right way, in the right situations)\nepistemically proper higher order epistemic attitudes.  \nThis conception of intellectual humility is most pertinent in the\nrealm of disagreement. The view of Roberts and Wood is similar,\nholding that intellectual humility is “a striking or unusual\nunconcern for social importance, and thus a kind of emotional\ninsensitivity to the issues of status” (2007: 239).\nTheir definition, like Hazlett’s, emphasizes the social nature\nof intellectual humility. Unlike Hazlett, Roberts and Wood put more\nweight on the intellectually humble person’s concerns and\nemotions, and less on her doxastic states. \nSamuelson and Church (2015), by contrast, characterize intellectual\nhumility in the dual-process language popular in contemporary\npsychology. Samuelson and Church think that intellectual humility can\nbe implemented as a motivating trait, but they are inclined to\nconstrue it in the dual-system framework, where it harmonizes\nautomatic intuitive processes (heuristics, affective judgments, etc.)\nwith slow, controlled, effortful, attentive thought and\ndeliberation. On this view, someone who tends to jump to conclusions\nbased on intuitions (“System 1”) fails to be\nintellectually humble, especially if he is not open to revising his\nbeliefs in the face of new evidence.  By contrast, someone who forces\nhimself to slow down and think carefully (“System 2”) in\nsituations where intuitive responses are liable to mislead would be a\nparagon of intellectual humility. \nWhitcomb et al. (2015; see also Medina 2013) propose a conception of\nintellectual humility as appropriately attending to and owning\none’s cognitive limitations. Such attentiveness can be\nconscious, but it is grounded in an implicit sensitivity to\none’s own dispositions. Attending to one’s limitations is\nin turn meant to lead to intellectually humble cognitive, behavioral,\nmotivational, and affective responses. This trait leads the\nintellectually humble person to revise her beliefs in light of her\nrecognition of her limitations, to try to overcome or quarantine the\nbad effects of her limitations, to desire to embody fewer and less\nsevere limitations, and to display fitting emotions (e.g., regret\nrather than amusement) towards her limitations. \nFinally, Christen, Alfano, and Robinson (2014) give a descriptive\nrather than a normative account of intellectual humility. Like the\nviews canvassed above, they think that intellectual humility can be\nunderstood as a multifaceted disposition that opposes other\ndispositions. Rather than consulting their own intuitions about what\nthe facets of intellectual humility and its opposing vices are,\nhowever, they employ a thesaurus-based psycholexical analysis, which\nsuggests that intellectual humility has three positive facets (the\nsensitive self, the discreet self, and the inquisitive self) and three\nopposing vices (the underrated other, the underrated self, and the\noverrated self). The sensitive self is characterized by comprehension,\nresponsiveness, and mindfulness—all ways of demonstrating\nopenness to new ideas and information. The inquisitive self is\ncharacterized by curiosity, exploration, and learning—all ways\nof seeking new ideas and information. The discreet self is\ncharacterized by demureness and unpretentiousness—ways of\nrelating to other people, especially those one might disagree\nwith. \nMiranda Fricker (2003, 2007) provides a detailed case study of the\nvirtue of epistemic justice and the opposing vice of “epistemic\ninjustice” suffered by the marginalized and less powerful.\nEpistemic injustice harms someone in their capacity as a (potential)\nknower and comes in several varieties. One species is\nhermeneutical injustice, which occurs when people are denied\nthe conceptual and linguistic resources to make sense of and\ncommunicate their experience. A prime example is sexual harassment, a\nconcept forged 1970s America. The other main species of epistemic\ninjustice that has received by far the most attention, though, is\ntestimonial injustice, which occurs when someone’s\nassertions are accorded less (or more) credence than they deserve\nbecause of prejudice of some kind, such as bias regarding identities\nlike gender, race, ethnicity, or age. The vice of testimonial\ninjustice is a disposition to commit such acts of epistemic injustice.\nThe virtue of corrective testimonial justice is a disposition to\nremain aware of and compensate for your prejudices by interfering with\nyour estimation of the value of someone’s testimony. This\ncorrective virtue, Fricker (2003: 161) argues, is cultivated through\nsocial training. \nMedina (2011, 2012, 2013) has developed a social-contextualist account\nof the virtue of epistemic justice and the corresponding vice of\nepistemic injustice. Medina (2011) argues that testimonial justice\nrequires the development of epistemic sensibility that detects and\ncorrects both undeserved credibility deficits and undeserved\ncredibility excess. \nSherman (2016) agrees with Fricker about the harm caused by\ntestimonial injustice but questions the efficacy of trying to\ncultivate a virtue to correct it. The essential problem is that people\ntend to think that their own opinions and trust in the testimony of\nothers are reasonable. If you thought that you’d given\nsomeone’s word too little weight, you would already have revised\nyour opinion. In light of this, Sherman suggests that efforts to\ncultivate corrective testimonial justice are likely to fail or even\nbackfire. \nFollowing Sherman, Alfano (2015; see also Alfano & Skorburg\nforthcoming) suggests communalizing the pursuit of testimonial justice\nby, for example, recruiting your friends to confront you when they\nthink you’ve committed an act of injustice and going out of your\nway to do the same when you witness injustice. Also in response to\nSherman, Davidson and Kelly (2015) argue that while it may be\ndifficult or impossible to adjust one’s credence in the moment,\ntaking distal ecological control (Clark 2007) over one’s material,\nsocial, and political environment can help to tamp down or eradicate\nthe biases that lead to testimonial injustice. Likewise, Washington\n(2016: 11) argues that because isolated individuals lack a “Bad\nJudgment Alarm”, the response to testimonial injustice should\nnot be to reflexively cultivate one’s own character but to\npromote a “social and moral ecology that facilitates the\nexpression of our values”. These approaches harmonize with the\nembedded, scaffolded, and extended virtue model described above, as\nwell as Kvanvig’s (1992) celebration of the role of the\nepistemic community. \nOther intellectual virtues have received less attention to date,\nthough not for lack of philosophical merit. These include intellectual\ngenerosity (Roberts & Wood 2007: 293), epistemic temperance\n(Battaly 2010), open-mindedness (Adler 2004; Baehr 2011; Carter &\nGordon 2014b),\nintellectual perseverance (King 2014b), inquisitiveness (L. Watson\n2015), and curiosity (Alfano 2013a; Whitcomb 2010). \nAs explained in section 6, practitioners have engaged in a lively\ndiscussion of what the distinctive value of knowledge is. The main\nquestion here has been what makes knowledge more valuable than true\nbelief? Further such value questions might be asked. For instance,\nwhat if anything makes understanding more valuable than knowledge? Or,\nif understanding is a species of knowledge, what if anything makes it\nmore valuable than knowledge that does not qualify as understanding?\nAnd what makes wisdom especially epistemically valuable? \nAnswers to these questions tend to home in on properties either of the\ncontent or of the cognizer. For example, there is a long tradition in\nthe philosophy of science on the nature of scientific explanation. In\nthis tradition, explanations provide understanding by communicating\nknowledge of causes (Lipton 1991; Salmon 1984; Khalifa & Gadomski\n2013; Turri 2015b). By contrast, epistemologists, especially virtue\nepistemologists, have tended to argue that understanding is a special\nstatus that arises from acts of intellectual virtue. For instance,\nPritchard (2016b) argues that understanding arises from “seeing\nit for oneself”, which manifests the virtue of intellectual\nautonomy. Stephen Grimm (2006) argues that understanding is a special\nkind of knowledge that arises from “grasping”, a\ndistinctive psychological act that manifests intellectual virtue.\nCarter and Gordon (2014a,b) argue that objectual understanding, in\nparticular, has a special value knowledge lacks, and further that this\nkind of understanding is needed in order to explain why certain\ntraits, such as open-mindedness, are intellectual virtues. And on\nZagzebski’s view, understanding is closely tied to mastery of an\nart or skill, does not pertain to discrete propositions but to\npatterns or systems, and consequently takes a nonpropositional object.\nUnderstanding does not result from mere acquisition of information, as\ncan propositional knowledge. She thinks of understanding as “the\nstate of comprehension of nonpropositional structures of\nreality” (Zagzebski 2001: 242). She also conjectures that we can\ndefine understanding analogously to how she defined knowledge. The\nmain difference would be in the relevant virtues that produce the\ndifferent states. Whereas knowledge derives from virtues that aim at\ntruth, understanding derives at least partly from different virtues,\nspecial ones hitherto “unanalyzed, even unrecognized”\n(Zagzebski 2001: 248). \nLooking beyond even understanding, Zagzebski further hopes that one\nday epistemologists will turn their attention to wisdom. Further, she\nclaims, VE makes it easier to “recover” interest in and\nanalyze understanding and wisdom. For more on wisdom and its potential\nconnection to the virtue of epistemic humility, see Ryan (2014). \nIt’s uncontroversial to say that many virtues are emotional\ndispositions, even if they involve behavior in addition to emotion. As\nmentioned above, intellectual courage disposes its bearer to\nappropriate fear and confidence in matters epistemic. Alfano (2016b:\nchapter 4) suggests that,\nbecause we are able to individuate emotions more clearly than virtues,\nit might be helpful to index virtues to the emotions they govern. If\nthis is on the right track, then intellectual virtues could be\ndistinguished and structured by cataloguing what Morton (2010; see\nalso Morton 2014, Stocker 2010, and Kashdan & Silvia 2011) calls\nepistemic emotions. These include such states as curiosity,\nfascination, intrigue, hope, trust, distrust, mistrust, surprise,\ndoubt, skepticism, boredom, puzzlement, confusion, wonder, awe, faith,\nand epistemic angst. Note that some of these emotions are referred to\nby words that are also used to refer to their controlling virtues. As\nMorton says, “the words often do triple duty. Character links to\nvirtue links to emotion” (2010). \nVE can benefit from theorizing about epistemic emotions in at least\nthree ways. One benefit of theorizing intellectual virtues via\nepistemic emotions is that doing so furnishes practitioners with a\nsort of “to do list”: many of the virtues related to the\nemotions mentioned in the previous paragraph are unexplored or\nunderexplored. These virtues are ripe for the picking. Another benefit\nof the lens of epistemic emotion is that it helps to make sense of\nintellectual virtues as dispositions to motivated inquiry rather than\njust static belief. Emotions are, after all, motivational states, and\nepistemic emotions in particular direct us to seek confirmation,\ndisconfirmation, and so on. This point is related to but more specific\nthan Michael Brady’s (2013: 92) idea that emotions in general\nmotivate inquiry because they “capture and consume”\nattention, thereby motivating inquiry into their own eliciting\nconditions. For instance, fear captures and consumes the attention of\nthe fearful person, directing him to find and understand the\n(potential) threat or danger. \nFinally, epistemic emotions help to make sense of the motivations and\npractices of scientists. For example, Thagard (2002) mined James\nWatson’s (1969) autobiographical account of the discovery of the\nstructure of DNA for emotion terms; the most common related to\ninterest and the joy of discovery, followed by fear, hope, anger,\ndistress, aesthetic appreciation, and surprise. In addition, the\nliterature on the demarcation between science and pseudo-science,\nalong with the literature on scientific revolutions, is peppered with\nthe language of emotion—especially epistemic emotion. Popper\n(1962) talks of scientists’ attitudes to their hypotheses as one\nof “hope” rather than belief. He distinguishes science\nfrom pseudoscience by sneering at the “faith”\ncharacteristic of the latter and praising the “doubt” and\nopenness to testing of the former. He argues that the “special\nproblem under investigation” and the scientist’s\n“theoretical interests” determine her point of view.\nLakatos (1978) contrasts scientific knowledge with theological\ncertainty that “must be beyond doubt”. Kuhn (1962) says\nthat the attitude scientists have towards their paradigms is one of\nnot only belief but also “trust”. He claims that\nscientists received the discovery of x-rays “not only with\nsurprise but with shock”, going on to say that “though\nthey could not doubt the evidence, [they] were clearly staggered by\nit”. \nIn times of crisis, says Kuhn, scientists are plagued by\n“malaise”. Such malaise has recently become most evident\nin social psychology’s replication crisis. For example, two\npre-registered replications of the so-called “ego-depletion\neffect” recently found that, despite decades of positive studies\nand successful meta-analyses, there appears to be no such effect\n(Hagger et al. 2016; Lurquin et al. 2016). A science journalist\nwriting for Slate magazine described these findings as\n“not just worrying” but “terrifying”, because\nthey suggest that an entire field of research is\n“suspicious” (Engber 2016, see\n Other Internet Resources).\n The article quotes Evan Carter, one of the young scientists in the\nthick of the crisis, saying,  \nAll of a sudden it felt like everything was crumbling. I basically\nlost my compass. Normally I could say, all right there have been 100\npublished studies on this, so I can feel good about it, I can feel\nconfident. And then that just went away.  \nOn his blog, social psychologist Michael Inzlicht (2016, see\n Other Internet Resources)\n writes that despite being  \nin love with social psychology […] I have so many feelings\nabout the situation we’re in, and sometimes the weight of it\nbreaks my heart. […] it is only when we feel badly, when we\nacknowledge and, yes, grieve for yesterday, that we can allow for a\nbetter tomorrow.  \nHe goes on to say, “This is flat-out scary”, and,\n“I’m in a dark place. I feel like the ground is moving\nfrom underneath me and I no longer know what is real and what is\nnot”. Practitioners of VE may be in a position to offer aid and\ncomfort to afflicted scientists, or at least an accurate description\nof what ails them.","contact.mail":"mark.alfano@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
