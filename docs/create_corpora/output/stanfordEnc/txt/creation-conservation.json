The major monotheisms unambiguously affirm that God both created\nthe world and conserves it. It is less clear, however, whether\ncreation and conservation are to be conceived as distinct kinds of\nactions. The question has its roots in medieval and early modern\ncharacterizations of divine action, and it has received renewed\nattention in recent decades.\n\n\nOn the predominant traditional view, conservation is continuous\ncreation. Adherents of this view typically say with Francisco\nSuárez that God’s creation and conservation of things are\n“only conceptually distinct” (Suárez 1597,\n120). Jonathan Edwards, for example, says, “God’s\nupholding created substance, or causing its existence in each\nsuccessive moment, is altogether equivalent to an immediate production\nout of nothing, at each moment…. So that this effect differs\nnot at all from the first creation, but only\ncircumstantially…” (Edwards 1758, 402; emphasis in the\noriginal). In other words, there is no real difference between the act\nof creation and the act of conservation, though different words may be\nused for them. Descartes, Malebranche, Leibniz, and Berkeley all\nexpress similar views. More recently, Philip Quinn likewise treats\nboth God’s creating and God’s conserving as species of\nbringing about a thing’s existence. We call the act\n‘creation’ if it occurs at the first time at which the\ncreature exists, and we call it ‘conservation’ if it\noccurs at a later time, but the action is the same (e.g., Quinn 1988,\n54). \n\n\nThe alternative to this view is that the act of conserving beings that\nalready exist differs from calling beings into existence from nothing.\nSome argue that each persisting creature plays a causal role in its\nongoing existence, so that God is not the sole agent as in an ex\nnihilo creation. Some also argue that conservation must be an\nongoing act, whereas creation occurs at an instant. \n\n\nA large part of what is at stake in the debate is the relationship\nbetween divine action and creaturely action. Continuous creation\ntheorists may reject a distinction between creation and conservation\nas an attempt to attribute a divine prerogative to created things. On\nthe other hand, those who endorse a distinction may regard continuous\ncreation theory as (to borrow a phrase) “one of those\nhigh-minded philosophical depreciations of God’s works that come\ndisguised as compliments to God’s person” (van Inwagen\n1988, 46 n4). The debate also raises a number of interesting questions\nabout causation, time, and their relations.\n\nIt will be useful to distinguish between several theses.  \nThe conservation thesis is inconsistent with the Deistic understanding\nof God’s relationship to the world, on which the world’s\nexistence and operation require no divine involvement after the world\nis brought into being. In a different way, the conservation thesis is\ninconsistent with any view that denies that created things truly\npersist through time. If no created thing exists for more than an\ninstant, God may well be continuously creating, but God is not\nconserving what has been created. Within traditional Jewish,\nChristian, and Muslim theology the conservation thesis is relatively\nuncontroversial, in part because the thesis is apparently implied by\nthe sacred texts. (One biblical example is Hebrews 1:3: “[The\nSon] is the reflection of God’s glory and the exact imprint of\nGod’s very being, and he sustains all things by his powerful\nword.” One quranic example is Al-Baqarah 2:255: “His\neternal power overspreads the heavens and the earth, and their\nupholding wearies Him not.” For a challenge to the conservation\nthesis, see Beaudoin 2007.) \nOne who affirms that conservation is a continuation of creation goes\nbeyond the mere affirmation of conservation to a theory about the\nnature of conservation. Such a person might have either the\nsame-action thesis or the sole-source thesis in mind. The same-action\nthesis implies that conservation is continued (or\n“continuous”) creation in the sense that the ongoing\nexistence of created things through time is an effect of the very\naction that caused them to exist in the first place. The action itself\nmay well be timeless, so it is the effect that is really continued.\n \nThe sole-source thesis implies that conservation is continued creation\nin the sense that God conserves in just the way that God creates,\ni.e., without the aid of created things, either as causal co-agents or\nas patients. Like creation, conservation is an ex nihilo act.\nThe view Edwards expresses above is a representative example of this\nclaim. \nBoth the same-action thesis and the sole-source thesis have a\nprominent role in the historical discussion of conservation, but they\nare distinct claims. Typically ‘continuous creation\ntheory’ names the sole-source thesis, which has come to be the\nsalient idea, but the language of continuous creation has also\nsometimes referred to the same-action thesis (e.g., see the\n‘continuata creatio’ entry in Muller 1985). \nYet another thesis is occasionalism, which says that God is not only\nthe sole cause of the ongoing existence of created things but also of\nevery other event that they may be involved in, including those in\nwhich created things may appear to affect others. Some have objected\nto continuous creation theory on the grounds that it implies\noccasionalism. (See section 3.1.) \nBecause of the ambiguity noted above, both defenders and deniers of\ncontinuous creation can find some inspiration in the thought of Thomas\nAquinas. In Summa Theologiae he says,  \nHere the doctrine of divine atemporality supports the same-action\nthesis. By one unchanging action God brings about the existence of\ncreatures (i.e., created things) at whatever times they exist.\n(Malebranche echoes this view in, e.g., Dialogues on\nMetaphysics, VII.7.) \nIn the article that follows, however, Aquinas argues explicitly that\nthis does not imply that God preserves created things immediately\n(i.e., without an intermediate cause). Some creatures depend on other\ncreatures for their preservation, as well as on God as their principle\ncause (Ia.104.2). Aquinas’s claim implies that the preservation\nof created things differs from their creation, and that the\nsole-source thesis is false.  \nContemporary philosophers Jonathan Kvanvig and Hugh McCann argue for\ncontinuous creation theory on the basis of divine immutability. They\ndefend their case against replies of two sorts: (1) attempts to limit\nthe object of divine creation so as to exclude the continuing\nexistence of creatures (while granting divine immutability), and (2)\nobjections to divine immutability. As Kvanvig and McCann acknowledge,\nthe notion of divine immutability faces a non-trivial challenge from\nthe argument that an omniscient being must know what time it is, and\nmust therefore change (see Kretzmann 1966). For this reason they\nsuggest bolstering the case for continuous creation theory with\nadditional arguments. \nFrancisco Suárez endorses the same-action thesis, attributing the view\nto Aquinas and others. For Suárez, creation and conservation are the\nsame act and do not differ “except merely conceptually or\nbecause of some connotation and relation” (Suárez 1597, 121). He concludes that\nconservation has no patient; God does not do something to an already\nexisting creature to preserve it. Rather, its preservation is an\ninstance of creation ex nihilo. So Suárez’s position\nincludes the sole-source thesis as well. \nSuárez supports his position by arguing that any distinction between\ncreation and conservation would be superfluous. He argues, for\nexample, that if creation and conservation were two distinct actions,\nthen the second would have to last for the whole time the creature was\nconserved. But if so, the first action could last for that time\nequally well, and there would be no point in positing two actions.\n \nSuárez also emphasizes that the effect of creation and conservation is\nthe same: the existence of the creature.  \nThe arguments of Aquinas, Suárez, and others were influential enough\nthat Descartes could later describe the same-action thesis as\n“an opinion commonly accepted among theologians”\n(Discourse on the Method, Part Five, 133). \nA number of thinkers have argued for the sole-source thesis not (or\nnot only) on the basis of the nature of divine action, but on the\nbasis of creatures’ inability to preserve themselves. In\nPrinciples of Philosophy, Descartes argued for God’s\nexistence from the persistence of objects through time. His reasoning\nmakes it clear that he regarded conservation as a continual\nre-creation.  \nIf created things were able to contribute causally to their ongoing\nexistence, then God would cooperate with the creatures in conserving\nthem. This would make creation and conservation distinct on the\nassumption that the creatures’ causal contributions are not\nredundant. But Descartes claims that, given the nature of time,\ncreatures have no power to conserve themselves, and that God\nalone causes their continued existence.  \nJonathan Edwards, a zealous defender of divine majesty and\nsovereignty, gives a similar argument for creatures’ dependence\non God for their present existence. \nLater Edwards adds that the same reasoning shows that no part of the\neffect is due to the antecedent existence of the substance in question\n(ibid., 402). He concludes, “God’s preserving\ncreated things in being is perfectly equivalent to a continued\ncreation, or to his creating those things out of nothing at\neach moment of their existence” (ibid., 401).  \nWhile Descartes’s argument, as stated, assumes that created\nthings persist through time, Edwards comes close to claiming that\ncreated things do not persist at all. Given continuous creation\ntheory, he says, “there is no such thing as any identity or\noneness in created objects, existing at different times, but what\ndepends on God’s sovereign constitution”\n(ibid., 404). However, he qualifies this with the claims that\nthere are different kinds of identity and oneness, and that\nGod’s constitution—that is, God’s decree or\nordaining—is what makes truths of this sort.  \nEdwards’s view has two disadvantages with respect to the case\nfor continuous creation theory. One is that the argument implies that\ncreated things are not genuine causes, a position explicitly rejected\nby most thinkers in the tradition (a matter to which we will return\nbelow). The other is that, because creatures arguably do not persist\non this view, it is inaccurate to say that they are conserved. God\ndoes indeed continuously create, but the objects so created are new\nobjects. So understood, the view implies that nothing is conserved,\nproperly speaking.  \nEdwards regarded creatures’ inability to sustain themselves as\n“plain.” Kvanvig and McCann attempt to bolster this\nposition by undermining several potential reasons for thinking the\ncontrary. For example, one might think that the diachronic character\nof physical laws shows that physical objects have an innate ability to\npersist. If they did not, what would make the laws reliable predictors\nof objects’ behavior? Kvanvig and McCann find this thought\nlacking on the grounds that physical laws presuppose the continuing\nexistence of the world. They are reliable because the presupposition\nis correct, but not because the objects they characterize are\nself-sustaining.  \nIs the idea of an innate self-sustaining quality tenable? Kvanvig and\nMcCann consider a number of possible construals and argue that they\nare of dubious coherence. They also give an argument with an\nEdwardsian flavor. A power to perpetuate one’s own existence\nwould be an ability to cause something to occur at a future time, a\ntime at which the exercise of the power would no longer exist. No\nphysical sequence of events could be the basis for such a time-jumping\npower, since such a sequence would itself depend on a power of this\nsort. So the power would need to bring about a future effect without\nthe aid of any intervening events to connect them. But nothing that no\nlonger exists can be causally operative, so there can be no such power\n(Kvanvig and McCann 1988, 42–3).  \n(See also\n Occasionalism.)\n  \nOne persistent worry about the sole-source thesis has its roots in the\nmedieval debate over whether there is secondary causation (i.e.,\ngenuine causation by created things). Suppose that created things are\ncauses: fire really does cause water to boil, and ice really does\ncause it to cool. If creatures can affect future events in this way,\nwhy should they not at least help to bring about their own future\nexistence? Why should their causal powers be limited to affecting the\nqualities of things without contributing to their own presence in the\nworld? Contrapositively, if created things cannot bring about their\nown future existence, are they also unable to have any effect on the\nfuture? \nOccasionalism is the theory that there is no genuine secondary\ncausation, since God is not only the first cause but the only cause.\nWe might be tempted to regard a fire beneath a pot of water as a\ncreated cause, but its presence is merely an occasion for God to cause\nthe water to boil. The worry about the sole-source thesis, then, is\nthat it implies occasionalism. William Lane Craig, for example, says\nthat continuous creation theory “runs the risk of falling into\nthe radical occasionalism of certain medieval Islamic theologians\n…” (Craig 1998,\n 183).[1]\n He refers to the Mutakallims, who resisted the Aristotelian claim\nthat objects have causal powers by nature (Fahkry 1958, 30). Their\nconcern was that natural (and therefore essential) causal powers in\ncreated things would be an inappropriate limitation of divine power.\nGod would not be able to remove the power of fire to burn except by\neliminating the fire (cf. Freddoso 1988, 95–6). \nNonetheless, occasionalism has been a minority view among theists.\nAquinas and Suárez both hold that conservation is in some sense\ncontinued creation but reject occasionalism in very strong terms. This\nis a typical position among theists, for most of whom the proposition\nthat continuous creation theory implies occasionalism would constitute\nan objection to the former.  \nIt is easy to produce arguments for continuous creation theory that\nalso support occasionalism. In particular, the arguments that are\ndriven by the inability of created things to affect the future (such\nas those by Descartes and Edwards, above, and similar arguments by\nMalebranche) appear to have occasionalism as a corollary. If no cause\ncan have an effect at a time at which it does not exist, then created\nthings do not bring about their future states, nor those of other\ncreated things. The changes in the world can only be caused by God.\nMalebranche and Edwards would have happily accepted this result;\nDescartes’ case is less clear. In contrast, Kvanvig and McCann\n(1988, 43–44) deny that their similar argument implies occasionalism.\n \nApart from any particular argument for continuous creation theory,\nPhilip Quinn argues that the view itself does not imply occasionalism\n(Quinn 1988). Whether causal relations are understood as Humean\nregularities, Lewisian counterfactual dependences, or necessary\nconnections, the proposition that God is the sole cause of the\nexistence of contingent beings does not entail that God is the only\ncause of events. It remains possible that contingent beings\nnonetheless have causal influence over the qualities and behavior of\nother such beings. The result is a cooperative picture of the evolving\nstate of the world. “God and the lit match collaborate to\nproduce the heated water: God provides the water, and the lit match\nprovides the heat” (Quinn 1988, 70).  \nAndrew Pavelich poses what we may call the first-moment objection to\nsuch a view. If we consider the moment at which God creates a universe\nof objects in motion, it seems that the causal powers of the created\nobjects could not account for the character of other objects,\nincluding their motion. At the first moment, only God’s creative\npower could affect their state. But if each later time is one at which\nGod creates the world ex nihilo, then each time is relevantly\nsimilar to the first. At no time will a created thing be able to\nexercise its causal powers (Pavelich 2007, 12–13).  \nOne possible reply (discussed by Pavelich) grants that a thing created\nat time t has no effect on other things at t, but\nnonetheless affects things at later times (whether the things affected\nare identical to things that existed at t or distinct from\nthem). Later times differ from the first at least in that they are\npreceded by earlier times, and this opens up the possibility that\nthings existing at later times are affected by causal powers exercised\nearlier. Such a reply is not available to one who, like Jonathan\nEdwards, assumes that no object can have an effect at a place or time\nat which it is not. However, for those who affirm causal relations\nacross time, a position that includes continuous creation but rejects\noccasionalism is a theoretical option.  \nOne reason for thinking that the persistence of created objects must\ndepend on some exercise of those objects’ causal powers, and not\nGod’s creative power alone, is that an object that did not\ndepend on its earlier existence could not really be the same object.\nTo persist, an object’s later existence must be due (at least in\npart) to its own earlier existence. Persistence, in turn, is a\nnecessary condition of conservation, since a world without persistent\nobjects would not be conserved in being but rather succeeded in\nbeing. \nWe have already noted (in section 2.3) that Edwards’s case for\ncontinuous creation comes close to denying that created things do,\nstrictly, persist through time. One might well wonder, then, whether\nthe sole-source thesis precludes creatures’ identity over time.\nThe intuition that persistence requires causal dependence (at the\nleast) is widely shared. Peter van Inwagen, for example, accepts it as\na constraint on acceptable answers to the question of how physical\npersons could persist between death and resurrection. In that context\nhe writes: \nMost physicalists who have since addressed this puzzle have shared van\nInwagen’s assumption despite the fact that denying the causal\nrequirement would make it much easier to provide a solution. This\nsuggests that the causal requirement has considerable intuitive force.\n \nThe sole-source thesis may even threaten the persistence of creatures\napart from the causal requirement. Craig articulates the question\nwhether the lack of a patient in conservation has this result.  \nOne way to defend continuous creation theory from the persistence\nobjection is to argue that it is possible to create the same object\nmore than once. Quinn distinguishes between creating something\n(bringing about its existence) and introducing something (bringing\nabout its existence for the first time). It is clearly impossible to\nintroduce something at more than one time, but, Quinn argues, it is\nnot at all clear that it is impossible to create something at more\nthan one time. Quinn thus calls the causal requirement into question\n(Quinn\n 1983).[2] \nTemporal parts theory may suggest another line of defense. William\nVallicella says briefly that an occasionalist can affirm the\npersistence of created things by holding that time is continuous and\nthat persisting objects are composed of continuum-many temporal parts\n(Vallicella 1996, 353 n. 20). If this is correct, then a continuous\ncreation theorist can presumably do the same. David Vander Laan\nconsiders a temporal-parts strategy and finds it problematic. Given a\nsufficiently inclusive theory of composition, he argues, a series of\nobjects may indeed compose an object that exists at various times and\nthereby persists, but if there are no causal relations between these\nobjects it does not seem that their sum could be, e.g., a human\nperson. Arbitrary cross-temporal sums need not be united by internal\ncausal relations, but persons must (Vander Laan 2006, 164).  \nVander Laan explores the range of options for resolving the tension\nbetween continuous creation theory and the causal requirement. The\ncontinuous creation theorist should explain what, if not causal\ncontinuity, could distinguish a case of persistence from a case of\nreplacement by qualitative duplicates. Of the options he considers,\nVander Laan suggests that the most viable one locates the difference\nin a divine fiat that is present in the persistence case and absent in\nthe replacement case (2006, 165–6). On the other hand, one who affirms\nthe causal requirement should explain in what sense God sustains\nthings in existence. Vander Laan identifies two possibilities: (1) a\njoint-sufficiency theory on which God’s causal contribution and\nthe creature’s causal contribution are both needed for the\ncreature’s persistence, and (2) a co-operative divine\nsufficiency theory on which God’s act must cause the creature to\nbring about its continued existence (2006, 172–4).  \nOne recent objection to continuous creation theory maintains that it\nimplies that time is not real (Pavelich 2007, 16–19). Pavelich argues\nthat for time to be real, it must have a kind of “temporal\ninertia,” a natural tendency to move from each moment to\nsucceeding moments. This inertia would include a natural tendency of\nthings existing at times to continue existing. But it is this very\nsort of inertia that continuous creation theory denies, since it says\nthat the existence of times and objects in time depend solely on\ndivine acts.  \nPavelich suggests that the tension between time and continuous\ncreation runs even deeper. Given continuous creation theory, times\nonly stand in relations of before and after because of God’s\ncreative activity. But then we cannot say that God creates one moment\nbefore or after another, as temporal relations hold only subsequent to\nthose acts of creation.  \nOne possible response to these claims is that time can be real without\n“temporal inertia.” Some will reject the intuition that\ntime must move or pass due to its own natural disposition. Some reject\nthe passage of time entirely. Others will say that temporal passage is\nreal and that it occurs precisely because of God’s creative\nactivity. (Recall the argument of Descartes quoted in section\n2.3.) \nAnother possible response is that there is a creation-independent time\nin which God operates that could confer reality on the time of the\ncreated world. Pavelich contends that even if such a time were real,\nit would not succeed in conferring reality on the time of the created\nworld. The moments of the created world would still not be directly\nrelated to each other so as to make time real. God could even create\nthem out of sequence or change the past, Pavelich argues, without\ncausing anything odd that a created being could notice.  \nAccording to Craig, it is intuitively clear that creation and\nconservation are distinct actions since conservation has a patient (or\nobject) and creation does not. To conserve a thing in being is to act\non that thing. In contrast, to create a thing is not to act\non it or on any other thing, but to bring it into existence from\nnothing. Thus the “circumstantial” distinction between\ncreation and conservation (i.e., causing the existence of something\nthat did not exist earlier vs. causing the existence of something that\ndid exist earlier) requires a deeper distinction between the natures\nof the actions themselves (Craig 1998, 183). We may call this an\nagent-patient theory of conservation (Miller 2009). Craig finds this\nintuitive distinction expressed in Scotus, though Timothy Miller\ndisputes this interpretation (2009, 475).  \nThis difference between creation and conservation also makes it clear,\nCraig argues, that the two occur at different times. Creation is\ninstantaneous; it occurs at the moment that the created thing first\nexists. Though the creation of a thing is generally preceded by the\nthing’s nonexistence, the act itself is not an extended process\nof moving something from nonexistence to existence. Until it exists\nthe thing is not there to be acted upon. But conservation is the act\nof preserving a thing in existence from one time to another, so it\nmust occur over an interval of time (Craig 1998, 186–7). In other words,\ncreation is synchronic, but conservation is diachronic. In several\nways, then, reflection on the very notions of creation and\nconservation lead us to see that the two are to be distinguished.  \nThe agent-patient theory has elicited two objections related to the\ntime at which conservation occurs. Vallicella argues that on this view\nGod cannot begin conserving an object (Vallicella 2002) and Miller\nargues that on this view God cannot conserve things continuously\n(2009, 478–483).  \nVallicella observes first that if conservation has a patient,\nGod’s conservation of it must be diachronic. If the act of\nconservation were simultaneous with the effect of the object’s\nexistence, then God’s act at a time would both cause and\npresuppose the existence of that object at that time. So the act must\noccur at an earlier time or over an earlier interval. Next Vallicella\nargues that if God creates an object ex nihilo at t, God\ncannot conserve it at t since it does not yet exist. Clearly God\ncannot begin to conserve an object at a time after it is created,\nsince the object would only exist at that time if it had already been\nconserved. So there is no time at which God can begin to conserve an\nobject. Miller responds by wondering why the object would not exist\nat t.  Vallicella’s distinction between the time of an\nobject’s coming into existence and the first time at which it\nexists is dubious, since a nonexistent object could not undergo a\nprocess of coming into existence (Miller 2009, 477).  \nMiller’s own objection to the agent-patient theory is that it\ndoes not allow God to conserve continuously (2009, 478–483). Though\nconservation is in general diachronic on the agent-patient theory,\nGod’s initial act of conservation must occur at the moment the\npatient first exists. This act either brings about the existence of\nthe patient at a later moment or through a later interval. If at a\nlater moment, then the patient will not exist at the times between its\ncreation and the moment in question. If through a later\n interval,[3]\n then during that interval God would not need to conserve the patient,\nsince its existence over that interval then would have already been\nsecured by God’s conserving act at its first moment. Any\nconserving act during the interval would be redundant. Beyond the\ninterval the dilemma arises again, suggesting that conservation on the\nagent-patient theory would need to be discontinuous, something like a\nperson pushing a merry-go-round every few seconds to keep it spinning.\n \nOne further problem of the agent-patient theory, Miller adds, is that\nif the act of conservation can bring about the existence of a thing\nover an interval, then there seems to be no reason that any sustaining\nact is needed after the moment of its creation. The interval of\nexistence caused at its first moment could be long enough to include\nthe object’s entire span of existence. So conservation over time\nappears to be unnecessary. \nThe arguments surveyed above illustrate how both the historical\ndiscussion and the contemporary debate about creation and conservation\nare multifaceted. Considerations regarding divine nature, human\nnature, causation, and time are all relevant to whether conservation\nshould be understood as continuous creation. A key task of those who\nwish to stake out a position in the debate, then, is to assess which\nof these varied arguments are most powerful and which can be met by\ncredible objections.","contact.mail":"vanderla@westmont.edu","contact.domain":"westmont.edu"}]
