The Observations gained\ndedicated advocates in Britain, America, and Continental Europe, who\nappreciated it both for its science and its spirituality. As science,\nthe work grounds consciousness in neuro-physiology, mind in brain. On\nthis basis, the central concept of “association,” much\ndiscussed by other British philosophers and psychologists, receives\ndistinctive treatment: the term first  names the physiological\nprocess that generates “ideas,” and then the psychological\nprocesses by which perceptions, thoughts, and emotions either link and\nfuse or break apart. In keeping with this physiological approach,\nHartley offers a conceptually novel account of how we learn and\nperform skilled actions, a dimension of human nature often left\nunexplored in works of philosophy. Such actions include those involved\nin speech—and, by extension, the conduct of scientific\ninquiry. As a work on the spiritual condition of humanity,\nHartley’s Observations affirms universal \nsalvation—the assurance that all people will eventually become “partakers\nof the divine nature.” In this regard, it presents an original\nmodel of psychological growth, which describes how the self both forms\nand transforms, as the person gains in “sympathy” and\n“theopathy”—put simply, learns to love, both\nothers and God.\n\n\n\nThe son of an Anglican clergyman, David Hartley was born in June 1705\nin the vicinity of Halifax, Yorkshire. His mother died three months\nafter his birth, and his father when David was fifteen. After\nreceiving his B.A. and M.A. from Jesus College, Cambridge, Hartley\npracticed medicine in Bury St. Edmunds (1730–35), London\n(1735–42), and Bath, where he died on 28 August 1757. He married\ntwice: in 1730, Alice Rowley, who died in 1731 giving birth to their\nson David (1731–1813); and in 1735, Elizabeth Packer\n(1713–78), despite the opposition of her very wealthy\nfamily. The couple had two children, Mary (1736–1803) and\nWincombe Henry (1740–94). Although severely afflicted with\nbladder stones, Hartley lived a full and active life: he practiced\nmedicine, engaged in mathematical research, sought a cure for\n“the stone,” devoted himself to intellectual and\nphilanthropic projects, and wrote the Observations on\nMan.\n\n\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, Hartley’s Observations was\nvalued very highly by people within the realm of religious dissent,\nscientific progress, and social reform. Writing in 1774, Joseph\nPriestley, a leading Unitarian and the foremost scientist in Britain,\nwrote that the Observations “contains a new and most\nextensive science” and promised that “the study of it …\nwill be like entering upon a new world.” He added: “I think\nmyself more indebted to this one treatise, than to all the books I ever\nread beside; the scriptures excepted” (1774, xix).  \n\nPriestley and his fellow Unitarians gave the Observations a\ncentral place in the curriculum in the dissenting academies. (For\nadmission to Oxford and Cambridge Universities, a student had to\nsubscribe to the doctrines of the Church of England—a requirement\nwhich excluded Unitarians, who did not accept that Jesus is God; hence\nthe dissenters’ need for their own institutions of higher learning.)\nFrom one report, we learn that students in one academy studied it for\ntwo hours every morning. In addition, in the late 1700s student\nradicals at Cambridge and Oxford also had their copies. \n\nThus the Observations was the focus of sustained study and\nhigh esteem—if you followed Priestley, the most important\nbook, after the Bible. The poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, converted to\nPriestleian Unitarianism at Cambridge, had his portrait painted\nholding a copy of the Observations (see Paley 1999,\n18–23), and named his first son David Hartley Coleridge. Other\nwriters offer similar testimonies. Few works discussed in this\nencyclopedia have been the objects of such deep personal\ninvolvement. \n\nWhile its admirers thought it  “a new science” of\nhuman nature, its critics—including Thomas Reid (1785,\n84–94) and the later Coleridge ([1817] 1983), no longer the\nyouthful radical—considered Hartley’s Observations\nconceptually wrong and morally hazardous. For example, Sir James\nMackintosh, who sympathetically praised “the extraordinary value\nof Hartley’s system” (1836, 253), nonetheless saw in Hartley’s\nbelief that consciousness derives from neurological processes an\n“error … deeper and more fundamental than any\nother,” sure to “involv[e] all nature in darkness and\nconfusion” (245). \n\nIn the nineteenth century, James Mill, John Stuart Mill, and William\nB. Carpenter (who all had studied the Observations in\ndissenting academies), along with Alexander Bain, founded the school of\nthought known as “association psychology.” They credited\nHartley with being the precursor of the science they had developed.\nHowever, John Stuart Mill wrote in the Preface to the 1869 edition of\nhis father’s Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind,\nthat, compared to his father’s work, Hartley’s Observations\n“is little more than a sketch, though an eminently suggestive\none” (Mill 1869, 1:xi–12). Hardly a recommendation to read the\nbook that the Mills had poured over as students. Why look at the\nsketch, when the fully drawn portrait is available? \n\nBy the late 1800s Priestleian Unitarianism, as a tradition of\nphilosophical practice, had died out; academic philosophers, especially\nthose trained in the Scottish school of common sense (the official\nphilosophy taught, for example, by the Unitarians who ran Harvard),\nknew that the Observations rested on a fundamental mistake;\nand association psychologists preserved a memory of this precursor of\ntheir science. Formal interest in Hartley’s Observations, as a\nwork to be read and pondered, discussed in lectures, written about in\narticles and books, had collapsed. The last serious engagement with the\nObservations appears in William James’s Principles of\nPsychology (1890, 1:553), and even there a casual reader could\neasily miss it. \n\nIn the twentieth century, Hartley’s Observations remained\noutside the philosophical curriculum: philosophers-in-training could\nfollow the well-traveled route from the “British\nempiricists” to Kant without turning aside to pick it up. And\neven if a person had wanted to, doing so was difficult, for after the\neditions of 1749, 1775, 1791, 1810, and 1834, and translations into\nFrench (1755 and 1802), German (1772), and Italian (1809), no further\neditions were published. Today, paperback reprints of earlier editions\nare available, but there is no modern critical edition. \n\nIn his Second Treatise of Government, Locke famously stated\nthat “labor fixes property.” It is the labor of people in\nthe fields of philosophy that fixes a philosophical text as a\n“property”—that marks its bounds and assesses its value.\nBut a work that has remained outside contemporary philosophy’s\npedagogical economy, as has Hartley’s Observations, is in an\nindeterminate position. A person today who picks the book up would have\nin hand a long book covering a multitude of topics. How to determine\nits properties? And how to answer the question of economics: What is\nits worth? To address these questions, let us imagine how one of\nHartley’s colleagues, a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS), might have\nresponded to the book on its appearance in 1749. \n\nA FRS in regular attendance at the society’s London meetings would be\nacquainted with Hartley, and would know that he had emerged the victor\nin a public medical controversy ten years earlier, which established\nhis reputation in medical circles both in Britain and on the\nContinent.  Hartley, working with Stephen Hales, researched the\nchemical basis for what they thought an effective folk remedy for\nbladder stones—a painful and hazardous condition that impaired\nthe lives of Hartley himself and many others, including Benjamin\nFranklin. In the course of the controversy, Hartley had published a\nself-revealing account of the prolonged and intense suffering he had\nendured, while undergoing the treatment.  \n\nThe FRS would know that this orphaned son of a Yorkshire clergyman\nwas now a successful physician, thanks in part to powerful patrons\n(including the Cornwallis family, and the Duke of Newcastle, who was in\neffect prime minister), had come into personal wealth, thanks to his\nsecond marriage, and that he had devoted himself to various\nphilanthropic projects, including the publication of the shorthand\nsystem devised by his friend, John Byrom. \n\nIf the FRS knew Hartley as a friend, he would know him to be a\nmathematician with a special interest in statistics, an amateur\nviolinist, and a vegetarian who saw animals as bearing a “near\nrelation” to humans. He would know him as a husband and father\n(unlike Descartes, Locke, Hume, and Kant). He would know that Hartley\nwas often in extreme pain, and in danger of losing his life, as he\nstill suffered grievously from bladder stones. And he would know him to\nbe a man with deeply unconventional religious beliefs. \n\nPicking up the Observations, such a reader would see that\nthe book presented itself as Newtonian science—through the use of\n“Observations” in the title (compare two groundbreaking\nscientific texts, Franklin’s Experiments and Observations on\nElectricity, 1751, and Priestley’s Experiments and\nObservations of Different Kinds of Air, 1774), and through the\ngeometrical format of propositions and corollaries that structure the\ntext. Were he to page through the opening sections, he would see that\nthe Hartley wrote for a reader already familiar with technical concepts\nin, for example, anatomy and physiology, and in the speculative physics\nin Newton’s Opticks. \n\nWere the reader to continue beyond the opening propositions of the\nObservations, he would encounter elements of another, older\ntradition: references to “perfect self-annihilation, and the pure\nlove of God” (OM 2, prop. 67), and quotations of select\nbiblical passages, especially the promise of becoming “partakers\nof the divine nature” (2 Pet. 1.4). These place Hartley within\nthe realms of pietism and mysticism. \n\nSpecifically, they are expressions of the “everlasting\ngospel” of universal salvation. For the Observations\nenvisions the restoration of a fallen, fragmented, and self-alienated\nhumanity to “perfect manhood,” in which all people, without\nexception, will be “members of the mystical body of\nChrist,” and as such will become “new sets of senses, and\nperceptive powers, to each other, so as to increase each others\nhappiness without limits” (OM 2, prop. 68; cf. prop.\n35). \n\nNeither the scientific approach to “man” nor the\naffirmation of universal salvation was in itself original. One could\nfind the former in the medical literature, and in Descartes. For\nversions of the “everlasting gospel” one could turn to\nvarious writers, including Peter Sterry, Cromwell’s chaplain, in A\nDiscourse of the Freedom of the Will (1675), Sterry’s fellow\nchaplain to Cromwell, Jeremiah White, in The Restoration of All\nThings (1712), the visionary Jane Lead, the mathematician Thomas\nBayes, in Divine Benevolence (1731), and, on the continent,\nCharles Hector de Marsay. \n\nWhat is distinctive about Hartley’s Observations is the\nsimultaneous presence of the two approaches. Although Hartley affirms\nthat the whole person is a “mechanism,” subject to\nscientific study, he is no French atheist, no La Mettrie (author of the\nnotorious L’Homme machine, 1748), but a person of deep\nreligious sensibility. Similarly, Hartley affirms universal \nrestoration—but with none of the hallucinatory mysticism of Lead or Marsay.\nRather, the doctrine is supported by an application of the latest\nscientific thinking. \n\nConsider the full title: Observations on Man, his Frame, his\nDuty, and his Expectations. Hartley attempts a synthesis, by\nshowing that bodily “frame,” moral “duty,” and\nreligious “expectations” all converge on the same \npoint—and that point is the overcoming of the chasm between hell and heaven.\nRecall that Hartley, like other Unitarians, believed the divinity of\nJesus and substitutionary atonement to be doctrines that obscured the\noriginal light of Christianity. Thus an explanation of\n“salvation” as something external and undeserved has no\npart in his thinking. Rather, he offers a scientific account of how we\nare framed, both physically and psychologically, so as ultimately to\nattain the state in which we are all be “partakers of the divine\nnature, loving and lovely, holy and happy” (OM 2, prop.\n56). \n\nThe scientific dimension of the Observations is in part\nmethodical and in part substantive. As a matter of method, Hartley\nproposes the scientific investigation of  “man.” As\nnoted above, this is not unique; physicians had been doing just this\nfor decades, and there were also the examples of Descartes’s\nPassions of the Soul (1649) and Treatise on Man\n(1664), and of Hume’s anonymously published Treatise of Human\nNature (1739–40). (There is no evidence that Hartley knew anything\nabout Hume, or Hume about Hartley.) What is distinctive about the\nObservations is that it extends Newtonian science to the study\nof human nature.  \n\nWe should assume, Hartley writes, that the body’s “component\nparticles” are “subjected to the same subtle laws”\n(OM 1, prop. 9) as are all other material entities. The subtle\nlaws are those Newton suggested in the “Queries” to his\nOpticks, and which Stephen Hales (1677–1761, remembered today\nas the father of plant physiology and for the measurement of blood\npressure) further developed in the chemical theory in his Statical\nEssays—i.e., Vegetable Staticks (1727) and\nHaemastaticks (1733). Descartes had earlier proposed a model\nof neural physiology, but in 1740s Britain the physics the model\ndepended upon would have looked out of date. Hartley, in contrast,\npresented a “theory of vibrations” that explained how the\n“component particles” that constitute the nerves and brain\ninteract with the physical universe suggested by Newton—a\nworld composed of “forces of attraction and repulsion” and\nhaving a minimum of solid matter. \n\nAs a matter of substance, Hartley proposes: \n\nNote the language: “corporeal causes”\n“generate” and “raise” ideas “by\nassociation.” Unlike later “association\npsychologists” such as James Mill, Hartley does not start with\n“ideas” as subjective entities already experientially\npresent to the “mind” and then ask how these are linked.\nRather, he starts with bodily, specifically neurological processes, and\nasks: how do such processes generate and raise our perceptions,\nemotions, thoughts, and actions? This is a proposal for neuroscience,\nnot a  version of philosophical or psychological\n“empiricism.”  \n\nIf the responses of a nervous system to its physical environment can\ngenerate and raise one “idea,” one flash of consciousness,\nthey can generate any, and all. Thus “the whole superstructure of\nideas and associations observable in human life may … be built upon\nas small a foundation as we please” (OM 1, prop. 11).\nFor Hartley, the foundation is simple: nerves “vibrate” (on\na molecular level, not as violin strings), change their frequencies or\namplitudes of vibration, and transmit those changes to other nerves.\nBut thanks to the vast number of associative connections between nerves\nand within the brain, this fundamental mechanism generates all the\ncomplexities of action we observe in living beings—both animal and\nhuman. \n\nThe first volume of the Observations ends with a bold\nstatement: if an organism “could be endued with the most simple\nkinds of sensation, [it] might also arrive at all that intelligence of\nwhich the human mind is possessed” (OM 1,\nConclusion). \n\nSuch is an expression of the “error … deeper and more\nfundamental than any other” with which Mackintosh charged\nHartley: that of overlooking ontological dualism, “the\nprimordial and perpetual distinction between the being that thinks and\nthe thing which is thought of” (1836, 245). Descartes maintained\nthis distinction by positing a substance dualism of mind and body (and\nby treating animals as “mere” mechanisms, without\nconsciousness, and humans as rational, sentient beings), and such as\nHume and later James Mill respected it (or at least avoided dealing\nwith it) by writing about the contents of conscious minds while\nkeeping well clear of neurophysiology. But Hartley ignores the\ndistinction between “thinking” and “thought\nof”; he affirms that neurological processes generate\nconsciousness. \n\nIn Hartley’s view, animals are conscious beings, endued with\nsensation and, in neurologically complex species, their own kinds of\nintelligence: hence he affirms their “near relation” to \nus—which obligates us “to be their guardians and\nbenefactors,” and is reason to refrain from making them suffer\nfor our sport or convenience, and from killing them for food\n(OM 1, prop. 93; cf. OM 2, prop. 52).What separates\nus from animals are simply differences in neuro-anatomy. \n\nAccept that “all that intelligence of which the human mind is\npossessed”could be arrived at by an organism possessing\n“the most simple kinds of sensation,” and what follows? To\nmany, a line of thought “involving all nature into darkness and\nconfusion.” To others, with Priestley, the way of “entering\nupon a new world” of scientific discovery, free of the dualism of\nspirit and matter. \n\nHartley’s starting point is the living organism, and specifically the\nphysical “vibrations” present in brain and nervous system\nand in the universe with which the organism interacts. From this\nstarting point, two important considerations follow. The first is that\nsensations and ideas are products, not givens, and their\n“generation” and “raising” require explanation.\nThe second involves the recognition that organisms are active beings.\nLike other animals, humans move about in, explore, and interact with\ntheir environments. What is more, humans become adept at performing\nvarious kinds of learned, highly skilled actions—e.g., playing the\nviolin. The “ideas” humans have largely occur within, and\nguide, such practices.  \n\nConcerning the first consideration: although\n“association” is a central concept in the\nObservations, it is not primarily a name for the process by\nwhich discrete experiential entities link up; rather, the\nprocess of neurological association generates ideas, including our\ncategories of perception. In proposition 11, Hartley states that\n“ideas, and miniature vibrations, must first be generated …\nbefore they can be associated.” He adds: \n\nBy stating that “all sensations and vibrations are infinitely\ndivisible,” Hartley is elaborating on a point made by George\nBerkeley, in his Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision ([1709]\n1948), that a being born “blind” to bodily feeling and\npossessing only sight would have no concept of space and would be\nunable to perceive a geometrically ordered world. To such a being,\nsensations would be “infinitely”—i.e., \narbitrarily—divisible. No stable, repeatable “ideas” could\narise from them.  \n\nHartley also agrees with Berkeley’s solution to this problem: we\nperceive a coherent world thanks to the generation of\n“ideas” (cognitive, semantic, and pragmatic responses to\nthe world) through the “joint impression” of sensations\nfrom distinct sensory modalities—sight, hearing, and especially\ntouch. As does Berkeley, Hartley identifies feeling or touch as\n“the fundamental source of information in respect of the\nessential properties of matter” and “our first and\nprinciple key to the knowledge of the external world”\n(OM 1, prop. 30). Thus, Hartley writes, “we call the\ntouch the reality, light the representative.” The sense of sight\n“may be considered, agreeably to Bishop Berkeley’s remark, as a\nphilosophical language for the ideas of feeling” (see Berkeley\n[1709] 1948, sections 6.4, 6.8, and 9.4). \n\nA “philosophical language” is one “without any\ndeficiency, superfluity, or equivocation” (OM 1, prop.\n83), and what makes sight a “philosophical language” for\nfeeling is that the two match each other: “The same qualities are\nmade by means of light to impress vibrations on our eyes, which\ncorrespond in great measure to those made on the sense of feeling, so\nas to vary with their varieties” (OM 1, prop. 30).\nFeeling and vision flow in tandem, with no missing, extraneous, or\nequivocal moves. It is thus joint impression, the correlation of the\nflows of sensation through two (or more) sensory modalities, so that\nthe sensations one  “vary with the varieties” of\nanother, that accounts for the fact that we have ideas at all. \n\nIn contrast, a person whose visual inputs are dissociated from his\nother sensory modalities, and especially his own movement and feeling,\nis unable to consistently identify any “visual ideas.” Such\nis the condition of a person suffering from a visual agnosia (see James\n1890, 1:48–50). \n\nThis first consideration thus naturally leads to the second, for\nboth Hartley, and Berkeley before him, are talking about the actions of\nan embodied being. A living being’s capacities for sensory\ndiscrimination, feature detection, and perceptual categorization are\nall involved with the repertoires of action that being performs, either\ninnately or through learning. \n\nFor many animals, the ways in which physical movements vary with the\nvarieties of visual cues is relatively fixed: cats pounce on mice (some\nof cloth), and swat at moths (or moving shadows on a sunlit wall). For\nhuman beings, thanks to the brain’s plasticity in forming “joint\nimpressions,” there are many ways in which the\n“varieties” of one sensation “vary with the\nvarieties” of another: at the sight of notes on a staff, fingers\nmove determinately upon a piano keyboard. Expert musicians, at the\nsight of the notes, hear the tune in their mind’s ear. \n\nBut how to explain what it is that the expert musician (or any\nexpert practitioner) does? And how does one learn to do this? \n\nIn the Observations, Hartley offers a conceptually novel\ntreatment of physical action—a topic largely absent from other\ntreatises, or inquries, devoted to “human nature” or\n“human understanding.” Even in James Mill’s Analysis of\nthe Phenomena of the Human Mind, a work with an acknowledged debt\nto Hartley, bodily action is touched on only in the last chapter of the\nbook, on “The Will.” But to an attentive “observer of\nman,” it should be obvious that we live by doing, by performing\ntasks that depend on repertoires of perfected movement, some (like\nwalking) mastered in infancy, others (like typing) later in life.  \n\nHartley invented to two words to describe physical movements:\n“automatic” and “decomplex.” \n\nHartley formed the adjective “automatic” from an\nexisting noun, “automaton,” to describe movements such\nas  “the motions of the heart, and the peristaltic motion of\nthe bowels” (OM 1, Introduction). Such \n“originally automatic” motions are homeostatic: As a heart\nbeats, the alternation of contraction and relaxation is maintained and\nmodified in response to the needs and experiences of the organism\n(OM 1, prop. 19). \n\nFollowing the discussion of “originally automatic”\nmotion is this theorem: “If any sensation A, idea B, or motion C,\nbe associated … with any other sensation D, idea E, or muscular\nmotion F, it will, at last, excite d, the simple idea belonging to\nsensation D, the very idea E, or the very muscular motion F”\n(OM 1, prop. 20). Through the physical association or neural\nimpulses in the brain, any sensation, idea, or muscular motion can\nbecome the stimulus that excites any other idea or muscular motion.\nOne’s heart beats faster at the sight, sound, or thought of something\none has learned to fear. \n\nThe formation of such  novel associations of stimuli to\nphysiological responses means that “originally automatic”\nmotions can transform into motions that are \n“voluntary” or “secondarily automatic”\n(OM 1, prop. 21). \n\nAn action is voluntary when its stimulus is an “idea, or state\nof mind … which we term the will” (OM 1, prop. 21).\nTo illustrate how ideas of the form “the will to …”\nderive from “originally automatic” motions, Hartley\ndescribes how a child gains motor control over parts and functions of\nher body. “Originally automatic” motions are brought under\ncontrol through a series of substitutions of the initiating stimulus.\nAn infant grasps the finger placed in her palm, and then the toy she\nsees, and then grasps at “the sound of the words grasp, take\nhold, &c., the sight of the nurse’s hand, in that state, the idea\nof a hand, and particularly the child’s own hand.” These and\n“innumerable other associated circumstances … will put the\nchild upon grasping, till, at last, that idea, or state of mind which\nwe may call the will to grasp, is generated and sufficiently associated\nwith the action to produce it instantaneously.” \n\nIt is important to note that, in Hartley’s account, the performance\nof a voluntary movement is not a dualistic, two-stage process, with an\nexecutive “faculty” of the Mind, the Will, first issuing an\ninstruction that the body then carries out. Rather, a movement becomes\nvoluntary through the living being’s interaction with the\n“innumerable … associated circumstances” of its\nenvironment, which interactions bring about a series of substitutions\nof the initiating stimulus. In this light,  “will”\ndoes not name anything substantive: it is a word  we use to\ndescribe an “idea, or state of mind.” And it is a word\npeople often use to express bafflement as to what this “state of\nmind” amounts to. Hartley notes that adults start calling a child\nwillful at the time he learns to walk, because “the child, in\nsome cases, does not walk when desired, whilst yet the circumstances\nare apparently the same as when he does. For here the unapparent cause\nof walking, or not walking, is will” (OM 1,\nprop. 77). But, he adds, “a careful observation … will always\nshew … that when children do different things, the real\ncircumstances, natural or associated, are proportionally different, and\nthat the state of mind called will depends on the\ndifference.” \n\nSequences of substitutions transform originally automatic actions\ninto voluntary ones. Hartley recognizes that the process continues, so\nthat voluntary actions in turn become what he terms “secondarily\nautomatic”: \n\nThink of learning to type or play the piano. At first one develops a\nrepertoire of voluntary motions. But fluency requires that the motions\nbe secondarily automatic.  \n\nTo his critics, notably Reid and the later Coleridge, Hartley’s\ncommitment to “mechanism” impeached the “freedom of\nthe will” and hence moral responsibility. But where such critics\nwere intent on affirming the adult self’s executive control over\nthought and action, Hartley’s concern is the opposite: he starts with\nthe infant and asks, How does a child gain control of the originally\nautomatic processes present in infancy? Gain motor control of her\nhands? Learn to walk, and dance? Play a musical instrument? Transform\nspontaneous burbling and crying into articulate speech? Hartley’s\ncritics accuse him of reducing the human being to a “mere\nmechanism.” But from a Hartleian perspective, the\n“mechanism” of “secondarily automatic” actions\nis an achievement, not a given—and a necessary achievement, if one\nis to live a complete human life. \n\nMost human competencies, though voluntarily performed, rely upon\nextensive repertoires of secondarily automatic actions. Such\nperformances are not prespecified and inflexible routines. When people\nplay music, they add flourishes, and  improvise if they are\nsufficiently skilled. When they do so, the actions they perform are\nwhat Hartley calls “decomplex.” \n\nReaders of the Observations would have been familiar with\nthe words “decompound” and \n“decomposite”—both from the late Latin decompositus, a rendering of the\nGreek parasynthetos—in which the “de-” prefix\nsignifies “repeatedly” or “further.” They would\nalso know the word “complex,” from Locke’s Essay\nconcerning Human Understanding: “Ideas thus made up of\nseveral simple ones put together, I call Complex; such as are Beauty,\nGratitude, a Man, an Army, the Universe” (Locke [1690] 1975,\n2.12.1). \n\nAvailable to Hartley were both Locke’s distinction between\n“simple” and “complex” and also instances in\nwhich the de- prefix meant “further.” On the analogy of\n“compound” to “decompound,” he wrote of ideas\nand actions being either “complex” or\n“decomplex.” In Hartley’s theory, the associations in a\ncomplex action or idea are synchronic, while the associations in a\ndecomplex action or idea are diachronic. In playing a piano, hitting\nthe D key at the sight of the printed note D is a complex movement,\nwhile playing a composition is a decomplex action. \n\nThe elements of a secondarily automatic, complex movement are\ntightly fused. In contrast, those in a decomplex action or idea are\nmore loosely associated (OM 1, prop. 12); this looseness makes\nit possible to include a repertoire of secondarily automatic movements\nin a variety of decomplex ones—the same notes in an endless number\nof tunes. Hartley also observes that people find it impossible to\nperform decomplex actions—play a tune, say a \nsentence—backward. \n\nDecomplex actions draw on different kinds of complex movements,\ninvolving the association of movements with perceptions in one or more\nsensory modalities: at the sight of the notes on the staff, or the\nsound of the tones, the pianist hits the keys. As a person becomes\nproficient at a type of decomplex action, the guiding sensory modality\ncan change. When learning to dance, Hartley observes, at first\n“the scholar desires to look at his feet and legs, in order to\njudge by seeing when they are in a proper position,” but\n“by degrees he learns to judge of this by feeling”\n(OM 1, prop. 77). Similarly, a practiced musician plays the\nharpsichord from “the connexion of the several complex parts of\nthe decomplex motions” (OM 1, prop. 21). One’s hands\nknow the tune. \n\nHartley improvised with language in order to articulate a new\nunderstanding of human action. Use of the one word became …\nautomatic. The other never made it into circulation. In a world in\nwhich “decompose” means “to rot,” it was\ndoomed. Nonetheless, we lack a widely available word for the concept\nthat “decomplex” names. \n\nHartley’s account draws particular attention to the dependency of\nour capacities for intentionality, flexibility, and innovation in our\ndecomplex actions upon the repertoires of actions we have made\nsecondarily automatic. It thus centers upon a key insight: “All\nour voluntary powers are of the nature of memory” (OM 1,\nprop. 90). \n\nIn Hartley’s account, at birth we enter the world already humming with\n“originally automatic” motions. Thanks to the activity of\nour brain and nerves, these motions are self-regulating and\nhomeostatic, responsive to bodily feedback and external stimuli. Then,\nas we grow, we gain voluntary control over some of our movements,\nperfect those that become secondarily automatic, and learn to carry out\ndecomplex actions that draw on repertoires of secondarily automatic\ncomponents.  \n\nIn Hartley’s account of human nature, the concept of the\n“association of ideas” plays a central role. But the\nparadigmatic instances of “association” are, first, the\n“joint impressions” that generate “ideas”\n(including complex movements), and second, the flowing cascades of\nmovement that are decomplex actions. Such decomplex actions are central\nto the lives we lead. And foremost among decomplex actions are the\nsentences we speak. \n\nFor Hartley, language is a highly “decomplex” motor\nactivity that involves the cementing of associations between perceived\nand created sounds, and, for the literate, perceived and created marks:\n“impressions made on the ear,” “actions of the organs\nof speech,” “impressions made upon the eye,” and\n“actions of the hand in writing” (OM 1, prop. 79).\nFurther connections must be made between perceived or created sounds\nand features of the world, especially the actions of oneself and of\nother people. Hartley’s approach is nearly the opposite of Locke’s, who\nwrites as if language were a dictionary, in which each word marks an\nidea known prelinguistically to the speaker: “words being\nvoluntary signs, they cannot be voluntary signs imposed by [the\nspeaker] on things he knows not… . Till he has some ideas of his\nown, he cannot suppose them to correspond with the conceptions of\nanother man; nor can he use any signs for them” (Locke [1690]\n1975, 3.2.2). \n\nThus while Locke seems to be saying that individuals first have\nideas, and then turn to language to communicate them to others, Hartley\ndescribes a process whereby, as children, we burble and cry and \nlisten—and gradually gain motor control of our burbling and crying,\nassociate it with what we hear and handle and do, and eventually learn\nthe meaning of what we say. Once again, the process of \nassociation—here the activity of hearing and speaking, and later reading and\nwriting—generates ideas: we have ideas because we use language, in\nconcrete social interactions; we do not create language to express the\nideas we, as lone individuals, already have. \n\nIn this regard, consider Hume’s assertion that, if we are unsure\nabout the meaning of a word, “we need but enquire, from what\nimpression is that supposed idea derived?” (Hume [1748]\n1975, 22), and his recommendation that we abandon words that lack such\nderivations. From Hartley’s point of view, this is manifestly bad\nadvice. \n\nFor Hartley, complex and decomplex ideas are wholes that do not\n“bear any relation to [their] compounding parts.”\nSpecifically, “the decomplex idea belonging to any sentence is\nnot compounded merely of the complex ideas belonging to the words in\nit” (OM 1, prop. 12). The meaning of an utterance is a\nproperty of the whole—of the performance of a specific decomplex\naction in a social and pragmatic context. Moreover, “both\nchildren and adults learn the ideas belonging to whole sentences many\ntimes in a summary way, and not by adding together the ideas of the\nseveral words in the sentence.” Consequently, children and\nilliterate adults find it hard to “separate sentences into the\nseveral words which compound them” (OM 1, prop. 80). \n\nThus the meanings of sentences are not simply derivable from the\nmeanings of the words in them, and the meanings of those words are not\nderivable from the “impressions” to which they refer. When\nchildren begin to speak, they utter “sentences” that,\nthough short (Mommy!) are whole, complete, and meaningful\nexpressions. It is only when they learn to read that they realize\nsentences are composed of individual words. Over time, the sentences\nincrease in decomplexity, as people participate in the activities of\nlife. As adults, people speak a vast variety of highly decomplex\nexpressions—including, for example, those involved in the practice\nof a science, or a religion. \n\nGiven that meaning is a property of complete expressions, Hartley is\nquick to point out that individual words often lack definite, shared\nmeanings. Such indefiniteness is, in Hartley’s view, hardly a defect,\nbut rather a valuable feature of language. Hartley writes that language\nis “one species of algebra,” and algebra “nothing\nmore than the language … peculiarly fitted to explain quantity of\nall kinds” (OM 1, 80).  \n\nThe algebraic quality of language is especially important in\nscientific practice. Like x and y in algebra,\nscientific terms, such as Hartley’s “vibrations” or\ncontemporary physicists’ “particles,” stand for unknowns,\nfor which vibrating strings or grains of sand provide only loose and\nmisleading analogies. Their presence is necessary for the practice of\nscientific discovery. Scientists employ “algebraic” terms\nin order to discern correlations and patterns that might otherwise\nremain unobserved: “Bringing an unknown quantity into a relation\nanswers, in philosophy, to the art of giving names, expressing nothing\ndefinite … and then inserting these names … in all the\nenunciations of the phenomena, to see whether, from a comparison of\nthese terms with each other, something definite in manner, degree, or\nmutual relation might result” (OM 1, prop. 87). \n\nIn such scientific practice, the more algebraic—i.e., free from\nassociation with sense “impressions”—words are the\nbetter. (Thus “quark” is an inspired choice.)  Hume’s\nadvice, to use only terms referring to clear “impressions,”\nif followed, would bring the practice of a science to a halt. \n\nHowever, to turn this around, the utility of words for unknowns\ndepends upon their proper use within ongoing practices. For examples of\nhow to conduct scientific inquiry, Hartley turns to mathematical\nmethods, and he includes an extensive discussion of these in\nproposition 87 of volume 1 of the Observations, which is\ntitled: “To deduce Rules for the Ascertainment of Truth, and\nAdvancement of Knowledge, from the Mathematical Methods of considering\nQuantity.” \n\nOne deduction involves the comparison of scientific investigation to\nthe use of the rule of the false position in arithmetic: “Here a\nfirst position is obtained, which, though not accurate, approaches,\nhowever, to the truth. From this, applied to the equations, a second\nposition is deduced, which approaches nearer to the truth than the\nfirst; from the second a third, etc.” Hartley adds that\n“this is indeed the way, in which advances in science are carried\non; and scientific persons are aware, that it is and must be so”\n(OM 1, prop. 87). \n\n“I frame no hypotheses.” Thus had Newton famously\nwritten in the Principia. Hartley responds directly: “It\nis in vain,” he writes, “to bid an inquirer form no\nhypothesis” (OM 1, prop. 87). Remember that Hartley was\na practicing physician; on the basis of ambiguous symptoms and fallible\nmedical knowledge, he was every day “framing hypotheses,”\nmaking diagnoses. The question, for Hartley, concerns the degree of\nconfidence we may place in our hypotheses. How do we measure how far\nour “first position” is from the truth, when we don’t know\nwhat the truth is? And how do we measure the degree to which the degree\nof error in our second and third positions has diminished? \n\nIn this regard, what is most interesting in proposition 87 is\nHartley’s discussion of probability. Hartley appears to have been one\nof a small circle of mathematicians who read, and understood, papers\nmaking fundamental contributions to the theory of probability by\nAbraham De Moivre (1667–1754) and Thomas Bayes (1702–61). De Moivre\ndeveloped a theorem that allows for the determination of the degree of\nconvergence between the frequency of observed events and the\nunderlying probability ratio, for any finite number of events. More\nimportant is “the solution to the inverse problem,” which\nHartley says “an ingenious friend” communicated to\nhim. This would be Bayes’s theorem—customarily attributed to\nThomas Bayes—which deals with determining the probability with\nwhich probability ratios can be inferred from observed outcomes, and\nwhich provides (a still controversial) foundation for statistical\ninference. In his discussion of probability theory, and other\nmathematical topics, Hartley is primarily interested in methods for\nmoving from observation to explanation, of assessing the \nlikeliness—i.e, believability—of hypotheses. \n\nHartley, like Hume, thought that belief was largely a matter of\nsentiment. “Rational assent” is a matter of the strength of\nthe association between a sentence (or even some of the words in it!)\nand the word “true” (OM 1, prop. 86)\n“Practical assent,” a person’s willingness to act, depends\non the vividness the proposition—and such can even make “an\ninteresting event, supposed doubtful, or even fictitious, … appear\nlike a real one,” thereby pulling rational assent after it.\n(Hartley notes, dryly, “the foundation of assent is still the\nsame. I here describe the fact only.”) But Hartley was not\ncontent to stop here, an exponent of an urbane skepticism. Belief and\nassent are matters of feeling, of sentiment, yes—but there are\nmathematical ways of thinking about the probabilities of belief. And\npeople who think mathematically make better physicians and scientists.\n(How many trials of an unproven treatment for bladder stones does one\nhave to run, to reach a threshold degree of belief in the results?) In\nthis regard, it is fair to say that Hartley was one of the first\nBayesians. \n\nOne other consequence of Hartley’s practice-oriented,\n“algebraic” approach to language concerns the validity\nof  alternate languages. In the “popular” language we\nuse every day, we talk of our choices, intentions, and resolutions, but\nin the “philosophical” language of the\nObservations, Hartley proposed we think in terms of \n“philosophical necessity”—in which every\n“voluntary” action is “excited by an associated\ncircumstance” (OM 1, 70). Some people had, and have, no\nuse for such talk: it denies the freedom (and indeed, the existence) of\nthe will. Hartley argues that the use of two incommensurable languages,\n“popular” and “philosophical,” is not a\nproblem, provided that we use them separately and consistently:\n“insuperable difficulties will arise” only “if we mix\nthese languages” (OM 2, prop. 15). Both languages work, in their\nown contexts of practice. \n\nHartley had a warrant for this affirmative approach to languages in\nhis scientific and mathematical training: Newton wrote the\nPrincipia in the language of geometry, but the\n“mathematical principles of natural philosophy” could be\nequally (and better?) expressed in the “algebraic” language\nof the calculus—for which there were rival notations. Similarly,\nHartley championed a new “notation” for the English\nlanguage—his friend John Byrom’s shorthand, which he saw as a reform\nthat would make our written language  more closely approximate a\n“philosophical” one. When he began work on the\nObservations, he conceived of the project as demonstrating\nthat language about “self-interest,” the “common\ngood,” and the “will of God” were different ways of\nsaying the same thing. The project was thus as much moral and religious\nas it was scientific. \n\nAs noted above, Hartley believed that all people will ultimately become\n“partakers of the divine nature.” Such is the\n“everlasting gospel” of universal salvation. Moreover,\nHartley sought to show that the gathering together of all humanity into\nthe “mystical body of Christ” is a process inherent in our\nnature: the psychological dynamic of association, which generates our\nideas and perfects our secondarily automatic movements, also “has\na tendency to reduce the state of those who have eaten of the tree of\nthe knowledge of good and evil, back again to a paradisiacal one”\n(OM 1, prop. 14). The question is, how does association\naccomplish this?  \n\nTo see how it does, we must look (1) more closely at the concept of\nassociation, (2) at Hartley’s notion of “transference,” and\n(3) at the series of psychological orientations association and\ntransference generate. And as we do so, we should keep in mind that\nmany of those who studied the Observations in the dissenting\nacademies appear to have valued Hartley primarily as a moral theorist\nand exemplar—for, that is, his description of the path of moral\ntransformation. Such is a common theme in their recollections. \n\n(1) We noted above Hartley’s collaboration with his friend Stephen\nHales to discover a medical treatment that would dissolve bladder\nstones. Following Newton, Hales believed “forces of attraction\nand repulsion” to be the basis of physical nature, and through\nvarious chemical experiments he demonstrated that solid concretions,\nincluding bladder stones, were compounds that had locked within\nthemselves large quantities of “air,” which normally\nmanifests a strongly repelling force. The “air” within a\nbladder stone could be released, and the stone dissolved, through\nreaction with an agent that would change the pH of the urine. Such\nchemicals are plentiful in the laboratory; the two men were looking\nfor one that a person could safely ingest. \n\nIn his Statical Essays, Hales proposes that\n“air” is a component in many “animal, vegetable, and\nmineral substances”: \n\nA seemingly inert particle of matter contains within itself forces of\nattraction and repulsion in a dynamic equilibrium. (Hence the readiness\nof the particles constituting the nerves to “vibrate.”) In\nsuch particles concretions and dissolutions occur continuously; the\nmaterials within the bodies of living things form, dissolve, and form\nagain—“that thereby this beautiful frame of things might be\nmaintained.”  \n\nHartley extends these chemical concepts to psychology. As an analogy\nto the forces of “attraction” and “repulsion,”\nhe writes of both “associations” and\n“counter-associations” at work in generating the frame of a\nperson’s self. The role of association is obvious—through\n“joint impression,” it generates “ideas,”\nincluding the complex movements that are the basis of the decomplex\nactions we perform every day. And as we shall see shortly,\npsychological associations form (“model”) the basic\norientations of the self. But “counter-associations” are\nequally vital. The counter-associations in our dreams, for example, are\n“of singular use to us, by interrupting and breaking the course\nof our associations. For, if we were always awake, some accidental\nassociations would be cemented by continuance, as that nothing could\nafterwards disjoin them, which would be madness” (OM 1,\nprop. 91). A sane mind, therefore, is one “maintained in a\ncontinual round of the production and dissolution”—in, that\nis, a dynamic balance of connection and detachment, memory and\nforgetting, that holds out the possibility of change and\ntransformation. \n\n(2) We noted in the discussion of action that, in Hartley’s theory,\na child gains voluntary control over his body through a series of\nsubstitutions. A similar series of substitutions, or\n“transferences” of emotion, are at work in the formation of\na person’s character. For example, Hartley offers a fascinating,\ndetailed account of how the spontaneous gesture by which a frightened,\nabused child raises his hand to ward off a blow becomes, through a\nseries of such transferences, the blow the abusing adult directs in\nanger at a helpless child (OM 1, prop. 97). Here, the links by\nwhich fear is transferred, and transmuted into anger, include the\nsituational, symbolic, and semantic: from, for example, being struck to\nthe “signs and tokens” of an impending beating—e.g., the\nbottle of gin, or the words of abuse and affection, the curses and\nkisses, that attend drunkenness. \n\n(3) Hartley offers an original model of psychological development.\nThe various emotional states (“pleasures and pains”) we\nexperience structure themselves into “six classes”:\nimagination, ambition, self-interest, sympathy, theopathy, and the\nmoral sense. These form two groups of three, each consisting of two\nbasic orientations and a means of regulating them. \n\nThe first group consists of imagination, the orientation toward\nobjects as sources of pleasure or displeasure, and of ambition,\nwhereby pleasure or pain derive from one’s awareness of one’s standing\nin the eyes of others. In this group self-interest is the ego, which\nattempts to manage and satisfy the demands of imagination and\nambition. The second group combines sympathy, the orientation of\npersonal intersubjectivity, and theopathy, the person’s relationship\nwith what the person takes to be the divine. (“Theopathy”\nappears to be Hartley’s invention.)  Hartley calls the moral sense (a\nterm then in widespread use) the “monitor” of sympathy and\ntheopathy; it is a higher ego, or self, beyond the ego. \n\nThe psychological structure the groups represent is epigenetic and\ntransformative. Like the accounts of twentieth-century psychologists\nsuch as Maslow, Erikson, and Kohlberg, Hartley’s theory describes a\nprocess of moral development as a sequence of transformations of the\nself. \n\nThe process is epigenetic in that the earlier orientations\n“model” the orientations that follow them. A young child,\nfor example, enjoys a pleasure of imagination when playing with new\ntoys; but when that pleasure transfers to the status that derives from\nbeing perceived by others to be a (good) child who has a collection of\nprized toys, the child is now experiencing a pleasure of ambition. And\nimagination and ambition then “model” self-interest, as the\nchild weighs the pleasures and pains, benefits and costs, of actually\nplaying with the toys versus keeping them on the shelf for purposes of\ndisplay. The problem remains in later life, when the pleasures of\npurchased objects derive more from their symbolic value than from\nactual use. This is especially the case when the purchases are made to\nsatisfy the pleasures of ambition—of being perceived as the kind of\nperson who can own a Mercedes, or who is fluent in the constantly\nchanging idioms of fashion. \n\nAlso contributing to the epigenetic modeling of the self is the fact\nthat imagination, ambition, and self-interest inevitably generate\ncounter-associations—experiences of pain or indifference where\none anticipated pleasure. Indulgence in the pleasures of imagination,\nHartley writes, often “lead[s] men into such a degree of\nsolicitude, anxiety, and fearfulness, in minute affairs, as to make\nthem inflict upon themselves greater torments, than the most cruel\ntyrant could invent” (OM 2, 54). Similarly with\nambition: keeping up with the “latest” fashion (in cars,\nclothes, or philosophers) for the sake of winning others’ approval is\nhard work. \n\n“We do, and must, upon our entrance into the world, begin with\nidolatry to external things, and, as we advance in it, proceed to the\nidolatry of ourselves” (OM 2, prop. 4). Some thus\nremain, anxiously pouring their sacrifices over these concretions. In\nothers the inevitable, painful counter-associations act as solvents,\nand cause the stony idols to disintegrate. Sympathy and theopathy\nreplace imagination and ambition as “primary pursuits,” the\nfundamental modes of experience and interaction. Hartley calls this\nreorienting transformation the “annihilation of self.” \n\nThis “annihilation” is not quasi-mystical obliteration;\nrather, it is a reorientation toward, or discovery of, a higher self of\nsympathy, theopathy, and the moral sense. It involves liberation from\nwhat William Blake calls the “mind-forged manacles” of a\nself-created and self-regarding hell and an awakening to one’s true\nhumanity. \n\nOnce they are “modeled,” the higher orientations\n“new-model” the lower. For the person for whom sympathy and\ntheopathy are primary pursuits, imagination and ambition remain modes\nof interaction, but modes that are transformed. Beauty may now be\nperceived in people and things previously passed over with indifference\nor distaste. And one’s happiness, indeed one’s hopes for one’s self,\nmay be linked with the happiness of people one previously sought to\navoid. \n\nThis does not mean, for Hartley, that life gets easier. Rather he\ndescribes the path as increasingly difficult. Although profoundly\noptimistic about the ultimate future of humanity—he is describing,\nafter all, how association tends “to reduce the state of those\nwho have eaten of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, back\nagain to a paradisiacal one”—he is acutely aware of the many\nbypaths of human self-deception and destructiveness. He is especially\nconscious of the dangers facing those whose primary pursuit concerns\nbeing sympathetic, theopathic, and morally perceptive. Such a person\ncan become “a bitter persecuting spirit” (OM 1,\nprop. 97). In general, the “higher” the level of moral and\nspiritual attainment, the greater the potential for a crippling,\ndemonic destructiveness. In this regard, reading Hartley one encounters\na vision of human nature as deeply conflicted, struggling against\nitself—a view similar to what one finds in Dostoyevsky or\nKierkegaard. \n\nAlthough Hartley identifies “sympathy” and\n“theopathy” as basic orientations, the orientations do not\nnecessarily have a positive content. Hartley does not claim that\neveryone is kind to others, or loves God. In some, these modes are\npathological, and theopathy is often only rudimentarily developed. In\ndiscussing the “associations [that] may be observed in fact to be heaped\nupon” the word God, he observes that these begin with the\n“compound fictitious idea” children form when they\n“suppose [God] to stand for a man whom they have never\nseen” and that they end, for many people, when this idea\n“is quite obliterated, without anything of a stable precise\nnature succeeding in its room” (OM 1, prop. 98). Many\nadults live with feelings of fear, aversion, boredom, and sometimes an\nardent longing, directed at a blankness—a mental picture, from which\nthe central image has been effaced. \n\nHartley’s model of the self in terms of imagination, ambition, and\nself-interest, and then of sympathy, theopathy, and the moral sense, is\ndynamically complex. In his moral psychology, emotions are like\nelectrical charges that easily jump from one object, symbol, word, or\nthought to another. Through such “transferences” of\nemotion, the six orientations develop content; like physical\nconcretions, they coalesce, as emotional energies are bonded together.\nAnd when the energy in one is sufficiently strong, the orientation\nbecomes the person’s “primary pursuit”: it demands\naccretion of pleasure. \n\nStill, the model is not static, with the self fossilizing into\n“one unactive cohering lump.” Thanks to the interplay of\nassociations and counter-associations, the six orientations both\n“model” and “new-model” each other.\nPsycholgical bodies are, as Hales said of vegetable and animal bodies,\nin “a continual round of the production and \ndissolution”—until such time, Hartley believed, as when all shall discover their\nidentity in that “mystical body” in which “all have\nan equal care for each other’s [happiness]; all increase in love, and\ncome to their full stature, to perfect manhood, by that\nwhich every joint supplieth” (OM 2, prop. 68; cf.\nEphesians 4.16).","contact.mail":"r.c.allen2@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
