He is widely considered as one of the greatest logicians of\nthe twentieth century (often regarded as second only to Gödel),\nand thus as one of the greatest logicians of all time.  Among\nphilosophers he is especially known for his mathematical\ncharacterizations of the concepts of truth and logical consequence for\nsentences of classical formalized languages, and to a lesser extent\nfor his mathematical characterization of the concept of a logical\nconstant for expressions of those same languages. Among logicians and\nmathematicians he is in addition famous for his work on set theory,\nmodel theory and algebra, which includes results and developments such\nas the Banach-Tarski paradox, the theorem on the indefinability of\ntruth (see section 2 below), the completeness and decidability of\nelementary algebra and geometry, and the notions of cardinal, ordinal,\nrelation and cylindric algebras. After a biographical sketch, this\nentry offers a condensed exposition of the parts of Tarski’s work that\nare most relevant to philosophy, his theories of truth, logical\nconsequence and logical constants. In this exposition we have\nattempted to remain as close as possible to Tarski’s original\npresentations, reducing to a minimum the number of claims that might\nbe controversial philosophically or exegetically. The final section on\nfurther reading refers the reader to other entries and works on\ncritical and exegetical aspects of Tarski’s work not touched upon in\nthis entry.\n\nTarski was born on January 14, 1901 in Warsaw, then a part of the\nRussian Empire. His family name at birth was Tajtelbaum, changed to\nTarski in 1923. He studied mathematics and philosophy at the\nUniversity of Warsaw from 1918 to 1924, taking courses with\nKotarbiński, Leśniewski, Łukasiewicz, Mazurkiewicz and\nSierpiński among others. (See Lvov-Warsaw School.) He got a\ndoctoral degree, under Leśniewski’s supervision, in\n1924. From then until 1939 he taught mathematics at a high school and\nheld minor teaching positions at the University of Warsaw. In this\nperiod he published prolifically on logic and set theory, building a\nstrong international reputation for himself.  Yet he failed in his\nattempt to obtain a professorship at the University of Lvov (now Lviv)\nin 1939. In 1929 he married Maria Witkowska, with whom he soon had two\nchildren, Ina and Jan. In August 1939 Tarski traveled to the United States to attend a\ncongress of the Unity of Science movement (see Vienna Circle). World\nWar II broke out soon after that, leaving Tarski no option but to stay\nin the States. He spent the war years separated from his family,\nforced to remain in Poland. In this period he held several temporary\nuniversity positions, at Harvard University, the City College of New\nYork, the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, and the\nUniversity of California at Berkeley, where he was eventually given\ntenure in 1945 and a professorship in mathematics in 1948. Maria, Ina\nand Jan were able to join him in Berkeley in 1946. In Berkeley Tarski built a prominent school of research in logic\nand the foundations of mathematics and science, centered around the\nprestigious graduate program in logic and methodology of science,\nwhich he was also instrumental in creating. He received many academic\nhonors, such as the membership in the National Academy of Sciences of\nthe USA and the election as Corresponding Fellow of the British\nAcademy. Tarski remained affiliated to Berkeley until his death, on\nOctober 27, 1983. \n\nIn a logic seminar he gave at the University of Warsaw between 1927\nand 1929, Tarski proved several results that made reference to notions\nthat later would be called “semantical”, in particular\nresults about the notions of definability and of truth in a structure\n(see Vaught 1974 and 1986). Vaught informs us that Tarski found\ncertain difficulties when trying to give a mathematically satisfactory\nform to the results presented in the seminar, and that this led him to\nlook for a precise theory of the semantical notions (cf. Vaught 1974,\npp. 160ff.  and 1986, pp. 870ff.). Such a theory did not exist at the\ntime. In particular, there were no definitions of these notions in\nterms of concepts accepted in the foundational systems designed for\nthe reconstruction of classical mathematics (for example, Russell and\nWhitehead’s theory of types or Zermelo’s set theory). Because of this,\nthe existing results in which these notions appeared could not be\nreconstructed in the accepted foundational systems. And there was no\nrigorous axiomatic theory of the semantical notions in which these\nwere taken as primitive, either. \n\nIn spite of this, the results about semantical notions were important\nand even moderately abundant by 1930. Among these Tarski himself would\nmention Gödel’s completeness theorem and several versions of the\nLöwenheim-Skolem theorem (cf. Tarski 1983b, pp. 240–1,\nsp. p. 240 n.1, and p. 241 n. 2). All these results use the notion of\ntruth in a structure, or functionally equivalent notions. And Tarski\nsays that \n\nTarski’s aim in a series of works on semantical notions was precisely\nto propose mathematically acceptable definitions of those notions, and\nin particular acceptable in some one of the chief foundational systems\n(the system chosen by Tarski will change with time; see below). With\nappropriate definitions of those notions, the theorems about them\nwould be susceptible of being reformulated making use of the defined\nnotions, and the uneasiness described by Tarski in the text just\nquoted would be alleviated. The alternative of taking the semantical\nnotions as primitive is also considered by Tarski in several places,\nbut he clearly prefers to avoid it if possible. The reason is that in\nthe axiomatic alternative there is no negligible risk that there\nremain ways of generating the semantical antinomies for the semantical\nprimitives of the system (cf. Tarski 1983b, p. 255). With the\ndefinitional procedure, however, the consistency of the definition\nwould depend exclusively on the consistency of the theory in which it\nis formulated, and this will be a theory we have reasons to\nthink is consistent. \n\nThe first work containing a mathematical definition of one of the\nsemantical notions is Tarski (1931) (English version, Tarski 1983d),\nwhere Tarski examines a language L in which it is possible to\nformalize the arithmetic of the real numbers, and gives a recursive\ndefinition of the notion “set of real numbers definable\nin L” (cf. Def. 9 in Tarski 1983d, p. 128). The\ndefinition depends on others that are a bit cumbersome; today we would\ndefine a similar notion in a simpler way with the help of the\ndefinition of truth that Tarski himself would publish two years\nlater. But the essence of the Tarskian definition of truth is already\nhere. In the 1931 paper we find also, as was to be expected, the\nTarskian concern with matters of precision and foundational rigor, and\na revealing statement about the attitude of mathematicians toward the\nnotion of definability, that could be extended to other semantical\nnotions: \n\nIn his classic monograph on the concept of truth “The Concept of\nTruth in Formalized Languages” (Polish original version, Tarski\n1933; German translation with an added postscript, Tarski 1935;\nEnglish version of the German text, Tarski 1983b), Tarski will present\na method for constructing definitions of truth for classical\nquantificational formal languages. When one succeeds in applying this\nmethod to a particular formal language, the end result will be the\nconstruction of a predicate in a metalanguage for that language whose\nessential properties will be that it will be constructed out of\nnon-suspicious mathematical vocabulary and that it will be intuitively\nsatisfied precisely by the intuitively true sentences of the object\nlanguage. At the same time, Tarski shows how, in terms of the defined\nnotion of truth, one can give intuitively adequate definitions of the\nsemantical notions of definability and denotation, and he indicates\nhow it is possible to define the notion of truth in a structure in a\nway analogous to the one used to define\n truth.[1]\n That allows him to conclude that the acceptability and rigor of the\n“recent methodological studies” (of Löwenheim,\nSkolem, Gödel and Tarski himself, among others), have been\nvindicated (cf. Tarski 1983b, p. 266). \n\nLanguages, both object languages and metalanguages, are in the\nmonograph not just interpreted grammars; a language also includes a\ndeductive system. A Tarskian metalanguage always includes its object\nlanguage as a part, both its grammar (perhaps under some translation)\nand its deductive system. And besides, it will always contain a few\nmore things if these things are not already in the object language.\nSpecifically, it will always contain a sub-language and sub-theory\nthat can be used to say a great deal of things about the syntax of the\nobject language; and it will always contain all the mathematics (both\nconcepts and methods of proof) that “may be taken from any\nsufficiently developed system of mathematical logic” (Tarski 1983b,\np. 211). \n\nTarski doesn’t give a general formulation of his method. Such a\ngeneral formulation would not be too illuminating. Instead he\nhelpfully chooses to illustrate his method as it would work for a few\nlanguages.  The most basic example he uses, to which about half of his\nmonograph is devoted, is what he calls “the language of the calculus\nof classes” (LCC). Here is a quick description in more current\nnotation (Tarski uses Łukasiewicz’s Polish notation): Besides all this, Tarski gives a deductive system for LCC,\nas required of every language. Tarski’s most basic idea about how to construct a truth predicate,\na predicate which will be intuitively satisfied exactly by the\nintuitively true sentences of LCC, is that such a predicate should\nverify what he calls “convention T”. This convention\nimposes a condition on defined truth predicates ((a) in the example\nimmediately below) that Tarski often talks about as grasping the\nintuitions behind the “classical Aristotelian conception of truth”\n(cf. Tarski 1983b, p.  155; 1944, pp. 342–3). Convention\nT is here spelled out for the case of LCC: Convention T. A formally correct\ndefinition of the symbol “Tr”, formulated in the metalanguage, will be\ncalled an adequate definition of truth if the deductive system\nof the metatheory proves the following: That a definition is “formally correct” means, roughly, that it\nwill be constructed out of non-suspicious vocabulary following\nnon-controversial rules for defining new expressions. But why should\none think that a predicate verifying convention T\nshould be, besides, coextensional with the intuitive predicate of\ntruth for LCC?  The reason can be given by an intuitive argument\nrelating both predicates, such as the following (cf. Tarski 1944,\npp. 353–4): (⇒) Suppose that “p” is a sentence of LCC\nsuch that Tr(“p”). By assumption,\n“Tr(”p“) if and only if\np” is provable in the metalanguage. So Tr(“p”) if\nand only if p (the metalanguage must only prove truths). So\np. So “p” is true. (⇐) Suppose that “p” is true. Then p. And\nthen, as before, Tr(“p”). Tarski defines truth in terms of the notion of the satisfaction of\na formula of LCC by an infinite sequence of assignments (of\nappropriate objects: subclasses of the universe of individuals in the\ncase of LCC). He gives first a recursive definition and immediately\nindicates how to transform it into a normal or explicit\ndefinition. The recursive definition is this: an infinite sequence of\nclasses f satisfies formula F if and only if\nf and F are such that The normal definition is this: An infinite sequence of subclasses f satisfies a formula\nF if and only if f and F stand in every\nrelation R among sequences and formulae such that, for any\ng and G, g and G stand in\nR if and only if g is an infinite sequence of\nsubclasses, F is a formula and either Tarski then defines the truth predicate as follows: \n\nGiven the way the definition has been constructed, it is intuitively\nclear that the metalanguage will prove all biconditionals of the\nconvention T for LCC. Tarski does not prove this\ncumbersome fact in a metametalanguage, and he helpfully contents\nhimself with showing how a few of the biconditionals would be\nestablished in the metalanguage. \n\nThe usual reasonings leading to the semantical antinomies cannot be\nreproduced for the Tarskian defined semantical concepts. In\nparticular, the antinomy of the liar cannot be reproduced using the\ndefined predicate Tr. Consider the version of the antinomy offered by\nTarski (due to Łukasiewicz). Abbreviate the expression “the\nfirst underlined sentence of this entry” with the letter\n“c”. Now consider the sentence: Given what “c” abbreviates, we get \nAnd the following is intuitively true: \nFrom (a) and (b) follows the contradiction The reason why this cannot be reproduced for Tr is that this\npredicate is always a predicate of a language (the metalanguage)\ndifferent from the language of the sentences to which it applies (the\nobject language). It is not possible to form a sentence of the\nlanguage for which one defines Tr that says of itself that it is (not)\nTr, since Tr is not a predicate of that language. On the other hand,\nit is certainly possible in some cases to form a sentence S\nof the metalanguage that says of itself that it is not Tr, but since\nS is a sentence of the metalanguage it is simply true and\n(presumably) not paradoxical, since there is no reason why a\nbiconditional like (b) should hold for it; biconditionals of this kind\nhold only for sentences of the language for which Tr has been defined,\nnot for sentences of the metalanguage. LCC has the property of being what Tarski calls a “language of\nfinite order”. The idea of order is familiar. Variables for\nindividuals (non-existent in LCC) are of order 1. Variables for\nclasses of individuals (all the variables of LCC) are of order\n2. Variables for classes of classes of individuals are of order 3, and\nso on. The order of a language of this series is the greatest positive\ninteger n with variables of order n. (Thus, although\nLCC looks grammatically just like a first-order language, semantically\nit can be seen as a fragment of what under present conventions would\nbe called a second-order language.) \n\nBut there are also languages of infinite order. In these the order of\nthe available variables is not bounded above. Tarski gives an example,\nwhich he calls “the language of the general theory of classes”\n(LGTC). Here again is a quick description in more current\nnotation: Besides all this, Tarski gives a deductive system for LGTC, as\nrequired of every language. Suffice it to say that it is a version of\na typical simple theory of finite types, with axioms and rules for the\nconnectives and quantifiers, axioms of comprehension and\nextensionality for all orders, and an axiom of infinity. Tarski\nobserves that LGTC suffices, with the help of some tricks, to develop\nall the mathematics that can be developed in the simple theory of\nfinite types, even though it has formally fewer types of\nvariables. In the 1933 original Polish version of his monograph Tarski says\nthat his method for constructing truth predicates cannot be applied to\nthe construction of a truth predicate for LGTC. The problem is that in\n1933 Tarski adopts as the mathematical apparatus of his metalanguages\nthe simple theory of finite types, or equivalently, LGTC.  In this\nlanguage, supplemented (and even unsupplemented) by a theory of syntax\nfor LCC, Tarski has everything he needs to give his definition of\nsatisfaction for LCC. In particular, the relation of satisfaction for\nLCC is a relation that can be found in the hierarchy of finite\ntypes. (Full set theory is not needed.) And the form in which Tarski\ndefines it quantifies only over sequences of classes and over\nrelations among sequences of classes and formulae (as we may check\nabove), and these are objects quantifiable over in finite type\ntheory. But the construction of a Tarskian truth predicate for LGTC could\nnot be carried out in finite type theory. The relation of satisfaction\nfor LGTC is intuitively a relation among formulae and sequences of:\nsequences of individuals, sequences of classes of individuals,\nsequences of classes of classes of individuals, etc. And this relation\nis not a relation in the hierarchy of finite types. Much less can one\nquantify in finite type theory over the objects necessary to apply the Tarskian\nmethod. One cannot quantify over sequences of: sequences of\nindividuals, sequences of classes of individuals, sequences of classes\nof classes of individuals, etc.; and one cannot quantify over\nrelations among formulae and sequences of: sequences of individuals,\nsequences of classes of individuals, sequences of classes of classes\nof individuals, etc. It is this situation that leads Tarski to\nwonder There is a problem even in formulating the question\nprecisely, for, as Tarski notes, But The negative answer is provided by a version of Tarski’s theorem of\nthe indefinability of truth. The weakest Tarskian metalanguage for\nLGTC will consist in expanding LGTC by means of concepts and a theory\nof the syntax of LGTC. But the mathematical part of the metalanguage\nwill be the same, for that’s the “sufficiently developed system of\nmathematical logic” of which Tarski spoke. Further, the metalanguage\nwill obviously contain its object language as part, both its grammar\n(under no translation) and its deductive system, because LGTC will\nappear both in the object language and in the metalanguage (cf. Tarski\n1983b, p. 247). In a word, the metalanguage, which we may call “LGTC+”, is LGTC\nplus a theory of the syntax of LGTC. The question that Tarski poses\nis, then, whether there is a predicate constructible in LGTC+ which\nverifies the convention T for sentences of\nLGTC. Tarski solves it negatively by proving the following\ntheorem: Theorem I. (a) In whatever way the symbol\n“Tr”, denoting a class of expressions, is defined in\nLGTC+, it will be possible to derive from it the negation of one of\nthe sentences which were described in the condition (a) of the\nconvention\nT; (b) assuming that the class of all provable sentences of the\nmetatheory is consistent, it is impossible to construct an adequate\ndefinition of truth in the sense of convention T on\nthe basis of LGTC+ (cf. Tarski 1983b, p. 247). Part (b) of Theorem I is a trivial consequence of part (a),\nsince it is the mark of a consistent system that it doesn’t contain a\nsentence and its negation. The proof of part (a) is an application of\nGödel’s technique of diagonalization. The following are the basic\nsteps described using the anachronistic recourse to a more familiar\ncase and to a modern, streamlined notation. View LGTC as if it were a standard language L for first-order\narithmetic. Suppose we extend it with a theory for talking about the\nsyntax of L (this would not be a Tarskian metalanguage, since it would\nnot include a “sufficiently developed system of mathematical logic”,\nbut all this is just for purposes of illustration). Call the extension\nL+. Then L+ can be “interpreted” in L using Gödelian techniques,\nby which Tarski means, roughly, that one can translate L+ into L\narithmetizing it in such a way that the translations of theorems of L+\nwill be theorems of L. Now suppose that φ(n) is the\nnth expression of L (and that this function is definable in\nL+), that d(x) is a diagonal function for\nexpressions of L (which is definable in L+; here I have in mind one\ninvolving substitution of numerals for free variables), and let\nn be the numeral of n. Then for every\npredicate E(x) of expressions of L defined in L+ one\ncan prove in L+ a general sentence of the form\n∀n[¬E(d(φ(n)))↔ψ(n)],\nwhere ψ(n) is a formula with one free variable entirely\nconstructed in L (through the arithmetization of the L+ predicate\n“¬E(d(φ(n)))”). Then one can also\nprove the sentence\n¬E(d(φ(k)))↔ψ(k),\nwhere k is the Gödel number of ψ(n).\nd(φ(k)) is the sentence\nψ(k), so ψ(k) is a “fixed\npoint” of the predicate ¬E(x): it “says of itself” that\nit has the property expressed by ¬E(x). The sentence\n¬E(d(φ(k)))↔ψ(k)\nis already equivalent to the sentence\n¬[E(d(φ(k)))↔ψ(k)],\nand part (a) of Theorem I is proved. In the postscript to the 1935 German translation of the\nmonograph on truth, Tarski abandons the 1933 requirement that the\napparatus of the metatheory be formalizable in finite type theory, and\naccepts the use of a more powerful theory of transfinite types, where\nthe transfinite objects are classes of the objects of lower types, or\nthe use of set theory. Tarski notes that the relation of satisfaction\nand a truth predicate for LGTC (and LGTC+) are definable in these more\npowerful metatheories (cf. Tarski 1983b, pp. 271–2). But he also says\nthat the proof of the indefinability theorem can be adapted to show\nthat, in general, one cannot define a truth predicate “if the order of\nthe metalanguage is at most equal to that of the language itself”\n(Tarski 1983b, p. 273). \n\nTarski presents his theory of logical consequence in Tarski (1936a)\n(German version, Tarski 1936b; English translation of the Polish,\nTarski 2002; English translation of the German, Tarski 1983c). This\nclassic paper begins with some general remarks on the possibility of a\nprecise definition of the concept of consequence. The essence of these\nremarks is that since the common concept is vague, it seems certainly\ndifficult, and perhaps impossible, to reconcile all features of its\nuse in the definition of a corresponding precise\nconcept. Nevertheless, Tarski says, logicians had thought until\nrecently that they had managed to define a precise concept that\ncoincided exactly in extension with the intuitive concept of\nconsequence. Tarski mentions the extraordinary development of\nmathematical logic in recent decades, which had shown “how to present\nmathematical disciplines in the shape of formalized deductive\ntheories” (Tarski 1983c, p. 409). In these theories, consequences are\nextracted from axioms and theorems by rules of inference, “such as the\nrules of substitution and detachment” (Tarski 1983c, p. 410), of a\npurely syntactical (or “structural”, in Tarski’s word)\nnature. “Whenever a sentence follows from others, it can be obtained\nfrom them—so it was thought—by means of the\ntransformations prescribed by the rules” (Tarski 1983c, p. 410).\nAccording to Tarski, this belief of the logicians was justified by\n“the fact that they had actually succeeded in reproducing in the shape\nof formalized proofs all the exact reasonings which had ever been\ncarried out in mathematics” (Tarski 1983c, p. 410). \n\nBut Tarski goes on to claim that that belief of the logicians was\nwrong. There are some non-vague cases in which a certain sentence of a\nhigher-order language follows in the intuitive sense from a set of\nother sentences of that language but cannot be derived from them using\nthe accepted axioms and rules. These cases are provided by some\nω-incomplete theories, theories in which for some predicate\nP the sentences  \n\nA0. 0 possesses the given property P, \n\nA1. 1 possesses the given property P, \n\nand, in general, all sentences of the form\nAn can be proved, but the universal\nsentence \n\nA. Every natural number possesses the given property\nP, \n\ncannot be proved on the basis of the accepted axioms and rules of\ninference. (LGTC provides an example of such a theory.) “Yet\nintuitively it seems certain that the universal sentence A\nfollows in the usual sense from the totality of particular sentences\nA0, A1, …,\nAn, ….  Provided all these\nsentences are true, the sentence A must also be true” (Tarski\n1983c, p. 411). \n\nTarski considers the possibility of adding an ω-rule to the\naccepted rules of inference, that is, a rule which allows us to deduce\na universal sentence of the form of A from the set of\nsentences A0, A1,\netc. However, he says that such a rule would differ in very essential\nrespects from the old rules: it is not a finitary rule, while all the\naccepted rules in common deductive systems are finitary. Also, Tarski\nimmediately takes importance away from the further suggestion of\nsupplementing the old system of rules by means of a formalized\nfinitary ω-rule. He points out that in view of Gödel’s\nincompleteness results, no matter how many new finitary rules or\naxioms we add to certain higher-order theories, they will still remain\nincomplete theories, in fact ω-incomplete theories. This\ndiscussion is enough to show that “in order to obtain the proper\nconcept of consequence, which is close in essentials to the common\nconcept, we must resort to quite different methods and apply quite\ndifferent conceptual apparatus in defining it” (Tarski 1983c, p. 413).\nThe different methods and the different conceptual apparatus that\nTarski has in mind are going to be “the methods which have been\ndeveloped in recent years for the establishment of scientific\nsemantics, and the concepts defined with their aid” (Tarski 1983c, p.\n414; a footnote refers us to Tarski’s monograph on truth). \n\nThe best way of appreciating the nature of Tarski’s theory of logical\nconsequence and how it constitutes an application of the methods of\nTarskian semantics is to see how it applies to a particular formal\nlanguage of a simple structure, of a kind that Tarski seems to have\nprimarily in mind in his paper of 1936. We will choose a simple\nlanguage of this kind for a fragment of elementary arithmetic. This\nlanguage, LAr, can be given this quick description: \n\nIn the 1936 paper Tarski seems to be thinking paradigmatically of languages\nin which (as in LAr) there is a predicate (“N” in the case of LAr)\nthat applies exactly to the individuals in the domain of the intended\ninterpretation of the language. He says elsewhere that the variables\nof such a language range exclusively over the individuals of that set\n(cf. Tarski 1937, p. 84). (This is not to say that Tarski adopts these\nconventions with all the languages he considers. For example, he does\nnot adopt them with languages which, like LGTC, are used to talk about\narbitrary individuals, as opposed to specific sets of\n them).[2] \n\nIn the considerations preliminary to the presentation of his theory,\nTarski says that when a sentence X of a formal language\n(e.g., LAr) is a logical consequence of a set K of sentences\nof that language, the argument with premises K and conclusion\nX has the following property, that Tarski calls “condition\n(F)”: \n\nLet’s clarify the sense of condition (F) with an example. Consider a\nlanguage LAr+ which is like LAr but has besides another individual\nconstant, “2”, and another dyadic predicate,\n“Pd”, whose desired interpretations are the number 2 and\nthe relation of being the immediate predecessor of,\nrespectively. Let K be the following set of sentences of\nLAr+:\n{“∀x(Nx→¬Mx0)”,\n“N0”} (these sentences are true); and let X be\nthe sentence “¬M00”. The argument with\npremises K and conclusion\nX is intuitively logically correct; thus, according to\nTarski, it must verify condition (F). This means that any\nargument obtained from it by uniform replacement of non-logical\nconstants by non-logical constants must be an argument where it is\nnot the case that the premises are true and the conclusion\nfalse. Let’s suppose that the non-logical constants of LAr+ are\n“0”, “N”, “M”, “2”,\nand “Pd”. Replace “0” with “2” and\n“M” with “Pd” in the argument with\npremises K and conclusion X and call the resulting\nset of premises and conclusion “K′” and\n“X′”. That is, K′ is\n{“∀x(Nx→¬Pdx2)”,\n“N2”} and\nX′ is “¬Pd22”. In virtue of condition (F), the\nargument with premises K′ and conclusion\nX′ must be an argument where it is not the case that\nthe premises are true and the conclusion false; and that’s in fact the\ncase: the first premise is false, and the second premise and the\nconclusion are true. \n\nTarski wonders if it is possible to offer condition (F) as a\ndefinition of the relation of logical consequence, that is, if\nwe can take (F) not only as a necessary but also a sufficient condition\nfor an argument to be an instance of logical consequence. His answer is\nthat we cannot. The reason is that condition (F) \n\nTarski notes that in order for an argument to be an instance of\nlogical consequence it need not be sufficient that all arguments of\nthe same form be arguments where it is not the case that the premises\nare true and the conclusion false. It is conceivable that one may\ninterpret the non-logical constants of the argument by means of\ncertain objects (individuals, sets, etc.) in such a way that the\npremises thus reinterpreted become true and the conclusion becomes\nfalse, and that nevertheless (some of) those objects not be denoted by\nnon-logical constants of the language that is being considered; in\nsuch a case we would not say that the argument is an instance of\nlogical consequence, in spite of the fact that it would satisfy\ncondition (F). \n\nTo give an example, suppose that the language we are considering is\nLAr+. Since both the relation of being less than and the relation of\nbeing the immediate predecessor of are irreflexive over the domain of\nthe natural numbers, the sentence\n“∀x(Nx→¬Mxx)”\nwould be a logical consequence of every set of premises on criterion\n(F): no replacement of the non-logical constants “N” and\n“M” by other non-logical constants of LAr+ turns that\nsentence into a falsehood. But clearly\n“∀x(Nx→¬Mxx)”\nis not a logical consequence of, say, “N0”. This can be\njustified, e.g., keeping fixed the usual interpretation of\n“0” and “N” but observing that “M”\ncan be interpreted by means of the reflexive relation of being less\nthan or equal to; under this interpretation,\n“∀x(Nx→¬Mxx)”\nis false, although “N0” is true. (Tarski’s remark that the\nsupposition that all objects have names in the language can never be\nrealized can be justified, for example, by observing that there are\nnon-denumerably many sets of natural numbers, but in the languages he\nconsiders there are only denumerably many constants.) \n\nTarski’s proposal consists in making tighter the requirement expressed\nby condition (F), so as to incorporate the idea that a logically\ncorrect argument cannot be reinterpreted in such a way that\nthe premises become true and the conclusion false; in other words, the\nidea that a sentence X is a logical consequence of a set of\nsentences K when every interpretation on which all the\nsentences of K are true is an interpretation on which X is true\n(or, to use a common terminology, when every interpretation\npreserves the truth of the premises in the conclusion).  \n\nAs Tarski says, the idea of understanding the notion of logical\nconsequence by means of the notion of truth preservation on all\ninterpretations is not an original idea of his, but one implicit in\nthe logical and mathematical practice of his time (especially among\nmathematicians interested in offering independence proofs). What is\nnew to Tarski’s proposal is that he makes precise the idea using the\napparatus he had developed for the mathematical characterization of\nsatisfaction and truth. He does not give a detailed example, but it\nseems reasonably clear how he would proceed from the indications he\ngives in (1936a), (1936b) and (1937). \n\nTarski uses a certain precise notion of interpretation for a formal\nlanguage. In our example, an interpretation of LAr is a\nsequence <A, a, R> that assigns\nappropriate objects to the non-logical constants of LAr: a set of\nindividuals A to “N”, an individual a to\n“0” and a binary relation among individuals R to\n“M”. Besides, he always requires that the objects assigned\nby an interpretation to the other non-logical constants of a language\nbe drawn from the set assigned to the non-logical predicate that\nrestricts the range of quantification to a specific set of individuals\n(“N” in the case of LAr) (cf.  Tarski 1937, §34); so\nin the case of LAr the individual assigned to “0” must\nbelong to the set assigned to “N” and the relation\nassigned to “M” must be a relation among objects in the\nset assigned to “N”. \n\nTarski introduces the notion of a sentential function. A\nsentential function S′ of a sentence S is the\nresult of uniformly replacing the non-logical constants appearing in\nS with corresponding variables of suitable types (and\ndifferent from the variables already existing in the language). For\nexample, the sentential function determined by the sentence\n“∀x(Nx→¬Mx0)” is the\nexpression\n“∀x(Px→¬Yxy)”\n(in which “P”, “Y” and “y” are new\nvariables). It is equally possible to define the more general notion\nof a formula function, in an analogous way, except that now\nS may be an open formula. The sentential functions of\nsentences of LAr will not in general be sentences, and so will not\nalways be either true or false by themselves. But they will always be\neither true or false with respect to interpretations of LAr;\nor, as Tarski says, they will be satisfied or not by\ninterpretations of LAr. \n\nThe concept of satisfaction of a sentential function by an\ninterpretation can be defined using the Tarskian method for defining\nsatisfaction. Say that an interpretation <A, a, R> of LAr\nsatisfies the formula function X with respect to a sequence f\n(that assigns values from A to the original variables of LAr)\nif and only if:  \n\nThis is a recursive definition, entirely parallel to the definition of\nsatisfaction of formulae by sequences in the definition of\nsatisfaction for LCC in Tarski’s monograph on truth, that we saw in\nsection 1 above. In the same way that that definition, the one just\ngiven can be turned into an explicit one by the same method. \n\nThe notion of satisfaction of a sentential function is easy to\ncharacterize in terms of the defined notion of satisfaction of a\nformula function. Say that an interpretation <A,\na, R> satisfies sentential function X if\nand only if <A, a, R> satisfies\nformula function X with respect to every sequence. This\ndefinition is analogous to the Tarskian definition of truth. \n\nIn terms of the defined notion of satisfaction, Tarski introduces the\nnotion of a model of a sentence. A model of a sentence\nS is an interpretation that satisfies the sentential function\nS′ determined by S; more generally, a model of\na set of sentences K is an interpretation that satisfies all\nthe sentential functions determined by sentences of K. And in\nterms of the defined notion of model Tarski proposes his defined\nnotion of logical consequence. A sentence X is a (Tarskian)\nlogical consequence of the sentences in set K if and only if\nevery model of the set K is also a model of sentence\nX (cf.  Tarski 1983c, p. 417). Tarski proposes also a defined\nnotion of logical truth (he uses the expression “analytic truth”)\nusing the same apparatus: a sentence S is a (Tarskian)\nlogical truth if and only if every interpretation of S is a\nmodel of S.  Analogous notions of Tarskian logical\nconsequence and logical truth can be defined for other languages using\nthe same method we have followed with LAr, just making the obvious\nchanges. \n\nAfter presenting his definition of logical consequence, Tarski\nimmediately adds that condition (F) can be shown to hold of arguments\nfalling under the defined notion:  \n\n(The proof that Tarski seems to have in mind is this: suppose that\nX is a Tarskian logical consequence of K; then there\nis no model of K which is not a model of X; so there\nis no substitution instance <K′,\nX′> of <K, X> such that the\nsentences in K′ are true and X′ is\nfalse; for if there was one such, it would readily provide an\ninterpretation—constituted by the extensions of the\nextra-logical constants of <K′,\nX′>—which would constitute a model of\nK that would not be a model of X. But whether this\nis the proof Tarski had in mind is a disputed exegetical\nquestion.) \n\nHence, as was to be desired, if the defined relation of logical\nconsequence holds for a given pair <K, X>,\nthen also condition (F) holds for it.  (Although this can be shown,\nthe converse cannot; that is, it cannot be shown that if X\nand K satisfy (F) then X follows from K\naccording to Tarski’s definition. But this is all right, since, as\nTarski has already pointed out, (F) is not a sufficient condition for\nthe ordinary notion of consequence.) Tarski did not think that the construction of section 3 completely\nsolved the problem of offering “a materially adequate definition of\nthe concept of consequence” (Tarski 1983c, p. 418).  According to\nTarski, perhaps the most important difficulty that remained toward\nsolving that problem is created by the fact that “underlying our whole\nconstruction is the division of all terms of the language discussed\ninto logical and extra-logical” (Tarski 1983c, p.  418). This\nsituation is tolerable because, as Tarski says in a letter of 1944,\n“it is clear that for all languages which are familiar to us such\ndefinitions [of ‘logical term’ and ‘logical\ntruth’] can be given (or rather: have been given); moreover,\nthey prove fruitful, and this is really the most important. We can\ndefine ‘logical terms’, e.g., by enumeration” (Tarski\n1987, p. 29). But since the division is not based on a previous\ncharacterization of logical terms generally applicable to arbitrary\nlanguages, to that extent the definition of logical consequence is not\nfully general, and hence unsatisfactory. In the final paragraph of the\nconsequence paper Tarski says that a positive solution to the problem\nwould “enable us to justify the traditional boundary between logical\nand extra-logical expressions” (Tarski 1983c, p. 420). In fact, this\nis the boundary which for Tarski is “underlying our whole\ndiscussion”. \n\nTarski says that the distinction between logical and extra-logical\nterms is not entirely arbitrary, because if we were to include signs\nlike the implication sign or the universal quantifier among the\nextra-logical terms, “our definition of the concept of consequence\nwould lead to results which obviously contradict ordinary usage”\n(Tarski 1983c, p. 418). This is so because in this case the definition\nwould not declare logical consequences many instances of the relation\nconsecrated by the common usage of logicians. However, Tarski does not\nseem to worry that the opposite problem may arise. The possibility\nexists, according to him, of extending the set of logical terms\nwithout making the definition of logical consequence useless. Even if\nall terms of the language are considered logical, the definition\nresults in a characterization of a special concept of consequence,\nthat of material consequence. \n\nWhen he speaks of extending liberally the set of logical terms, Tarski\nis perhaps thinking of the phenomenon of what he calls the\n“disciplines preceding a given discipline” in Tarski (1937) (see p.\n80). He speaks of logic as preceding every discipline, in the sense\nthat logical constants and logical laws are presupposed by and form\npart of every science. But similarly, in developing a certain theory,\nnot only logic but other theories may be taken for granted; thus\nTarski speaks of logic and arithmetic as a conveniently presupposed\nbasis of theories for the development of geometry. This would account\nnaturally for the fact that Tarski was skeptical about the possibility\nof finding a sharp distinction between logical and extra-logical\nterms, for it might very well depend on the context of investigation\nwhat terms and what laws are considered as forming part of the “logic”\nof the investigation.  \n\nAn example which we know Tarski had in mind is the sign for the\nmembership relation. We find him saying: “sometimes it seems to me\nconvenient to include mathematical terms, like the ∈-relation,\nin the class of logical ones, and sometimes I prefer to restrict\nmyself to terms of ‘elementary logic’. Is any problem\ninvolved here?” (Tarski 1987, p. 29). We may take the sign for\nmembership as a logical sign in some formalizations of the theory of\ntypes (which can in turn be used to formalize theories with arbitrary\nuniverses of individuals). But when doing set theory for its own sake,\nthe appropriate thing is not to take membership as a logical notion,\nand not to assume principles about membership as forming part of the\n“logic” of the theory, but as postulates thereof. Tarski’s final\nremarks in the paper on logical consequence again put forward the view\nthat the notion of logical constant may be of a relative character. In\ndifferent contexts different terms may be taken as logical and\ntherefore so may vary the extension of the relation of logical\nconsequence. He says that “the fluctuation in the common usage of the\nconcept of consequence would—in part at least—be quite\nnaturally reflected in such a compulsory situation” of relativity\n(Tarski 1983c, p. 420). \n\nBut this does not mean that no desiderata could or should be imposed\non a definition of the concept of a logical constant. Many years after\nwriting his paper on logical consequence, Tarski returned to the\nproblem of the definition of the concept of a logical term, advancing\nan attempt at a positive solution. Tarski thought that this solution\naccommodated his conviction that the notion of a logical term is not\nan absolute, but a relative one. \n\nThe basis for the proposed solution appears in Tarski’s 1966 lecture\n“What are Logical Notions?” (published posthumously as Tarski 1986a).\nHere Tarski first makes some remarks about the general nature of his\nproposal. He says that an answer to a question like the one that gives\ntitle to the lecture may take several forms. It may give an account of\nthe prevailing usage of the term “logical notion”, or of the\nprevailing usage of the term among people who are qualified to use\nit. It may be a normative proposal, a suggestion that the term be used\nin a certain way, independently of its actual use. As a third\npossibility, some other answers  \n\nImmediately Tarski makes it clear that he is also not concerned with\ndeveloping a normative proposal, but an account which captures a\ncertain common use of the concept of logical notion: “in\nanswering the question ‘What are logical notions?’ what I\nshall do is make a suggestion or proposal about a possible use of the\nterm ‘logical notion’. This suggestion seems to me to be\nin agreement, if not with a prevailing usage of the term\n‘logical notion’, at least with one usage which actually\nis encountered in practice” (Tarski 1986a, p. 145).  \n\nWhat are notions? Tarski says: \n\nHe then proposes to define logical notions as those notions invariant\nunder all one-one transformations of the universe of discourse onto\nitself: \n\nA one-one transformation of a class onto itself, also called a\npermutation, induces permutations of all the types in the hierarchy of\ntypes of “notions” determined by the class. Thus, a permutation\nP of a domain of individuals D induces a permutation\nof the class of n-ary relations of elements of D, a\npermutation of the class of functions with n arguments with domain\nDn and range included in D, a\npermutation of the class of n-ary relations among relations\nof elements of D, etc. A notion or object O of a\ncertain type t is invariant under all permutations of the\nuniverse of discourse if, for every permutation P of this\nuniverse, the permutation P̃ induced by P in\nthe class of notions of type t is such that\nP̃(O)=O. \n\nThere is no straightforward way in which the truth-functions and the\nquantifiers (over any type of objects) are identifiable with notions\nin the sense of Tarski. According to John Corcoran (see footnote 6 in\nTarski 1986a, p. 150), in one version of the lecture Tarski indicated\nthat the truth-functions and classical quantifiers can be constructed\nas certain objects in the type hierarchy that are invariant under all\npermutations, and, in this sense, are logical notions. (Clearly,\nTarski took the logicality of these notions almost for granted, and\nwas concerned with a definition which gave some account of the status\nof other more substantive notions in various mathematical languages.)\nFor example, the truth-values “true” and\n“false” can be identified with the universe of individuals\nand the null set, respectively, and the truth-functions in turn with\nfunctions having (tuples of) these classes as arguments and values;\nand the classical universal and existential quantifiers over a type of\nobjects t can be identified with certain functions from the\nclass of sets of objects of type t into the class of\ntruth-values—identifying “true” with the universal\nset of objects of type t and “false” with the\nempty set of that type. (A universal quantifier will assign\n“true” to the set of all objects of type t, and\n“false” to all other subsets of t; and the\nexistential quantifier will assign “true” to the non-empty\nsubsets, and “false” to the empty subset.) \n\nIn 1966 Tarski does not propose a definition of the concept of logical\nconstant. One such definition, based on the 1966 idea, appears in a\nbook Tarski wrote in collaboration with Steven Givant, published in\n1987, four years after Tarski’s death. The main concern of Tarski and\nGivant (1987) is to indicate how to develop set theory in several\ndifferent languages and to compare their expressive power. They define\nthe concept of logical constant for constants in the vocabulary of a\ncertain class of languages—all of which are in a certain sense\nextensions of a basic language in which they are particularly\ninterested, weaker than the languages in which set theory is usually\ndeveloped in means of expression, and yet sufficiently powerful for\nmany purposes. The vocabulary of the basic language is composed of\nthree two-place predicate constants of the second type and four\ntwo-place function constants of the third type; the vocabulary of the\nextensions considered by Tarski and Givant can only include constants\nof those two kinds. (However, as we will see, there does not seem to\nbe any problem in extending the range of applicability of their\ndefinition to wider classes of languages.) They\nthen prove several results about that class of languages, results that\ninvolve the defined concept of logical constant. \n\nTarski and Givant introduce informally the concept of a derivative\nuniverse of a given basic universe U. A derivative universe\nŨ of a given basic universe U is what we have\nbeen calling the class of all objects of a certain type, generated\nfrom that basic universe U. Thus, the class of n-ary\nrelations of elements of U (for any given n), the\nclass of n-ary relations among relations of elements of\nU, etc., are derivative universes of U. After\nintroducing in the same way as above the concepts of a permutation of\nthe universe and of invariance of a member of a derivative universe\nunder every permutation of the basic universe, Tarski and Givant give\nthe following definitions: Given a basic universe U, a member M of any\nderivative universe Ũ is said to be logical, or a\nlogical object, if it is invariant under every permutation P\nof U. \n  (Strictly speaking, since an object M can be a member of many\nderivative universes, we should use in (i) the phrase “is said to be\nlogical, or a logical object, as a member of Ũ”.) \n\n(i) and the parenthetical comment that comes after it embody fairly\naccurately the basic idea behind the (relativized) definition of a\nlogical notion offered in Tarski (1986a), and (ii) offers the\n(absolute) definition of the concept of logical constant. There is no\napparent obstacle to applying (ii) to wider classes of languages than\nthe class considered for special purposes of their investigation by\nTarski and Givant. It seems safe to assume that the definition can be\napplied to a large class of languages in the classical hierarchy of\nquantificational languages. Tarski and Givant themselves say that the\nusual logical constants of languages not in the class considered by\nthem, like the symbols for the truth-functional connectives and\nquantifiers, “can also be subsumed under logical constants in the\nsense of (ii)” (Tarski and Givant 1987, p. 57), presumably through\nsome artifice in the style of the one discussed above. (As we will\nsoon see, at the very least Tarski clearly would want his definition\nto be applicable to some languages whose set of sentences is that of\nsome formulations of the simple theory of types.) \n\nIn Tarski and Lindenbaum (1935) the authors had proved that given a\nbasic universe U, all the notions in derivative universes of\nU which can be defined in the language of the simple theory\nof types are invariant under all permutations of U. In\ngeneral the Tarski-Lindenbaum theorem guarantees that all mathematical\nnotions definable in the logicist fashion in the simple theory of\ntypes are logical notions no matter what the universe of individuals\nis taken to be (Tarski says that “we may interpret [the universe of\nthe intended interpretation of the language of the theory of types] as\nthe universe of physical objects, although there is nothing in\nPrincipia mathematica which compels us to accept such an\ninterpretation” (Tarski 1986a, p. 152)). Since the theorem applies to\nevery universe U supplying an interpretation of the language\nof the theory of types, the definition of the concept of logical\nconstant in Tarski and Givant (1987) implies that all primitive\nsymbols denoting notions in that language (e.g. quantifiers of all\norders) are Tarskian logical constants; also, if the definition were\napplicable to defined symbols, all these symbols would be Tarskian\nlogical constants. Such results agree well with a “usage actually\nencountered in practice” (for example, the practice of the logicists,\nbut of others as well) according to which the constants of the\nlanguage of the theory of types are logical constants. \n\nWhen the Tarski-Givant definition is applied to interpreted languages\nof mathematical theories with undefined mathematical primitives, it\nwill generally yield the result that the notions denoted by these\nprimitives are not Tarskian logical constants. Tarski’s example is set\ntheory formalized in first-order with a single primitive predicate for\nmembership as a relation among elements of the universe (see Tarski\n1986a, p. 153). Obviously membership as a relation over a domain of\nindividuals and sets is not invariant under all permutations of that\ndomain, so it is not declared a logical notion of the language of set\ntheory by Tarski’s proposed definition. Similarly, the class of all\nsets will be declared non-logical provided the class of individuals\nthat are not sets is not empty. A predicate whose intended meaning is\nmembership (among elements of the universe) is not a Tarskian logical\nconstant, simply because there is a universe in which it denotes a\nnon-logical object (with respect to that universe); similarly, a\npredicate “S” whose intended meaning is “is\na set” (such as is used in some formalizations of set theory\nsuitable for contemplating individuals other than sets in the\nuniverse) is not a Tarskian logical constant, for there is a universe\nin which “S” denotes a non-logical object (in\nsuch a universe, the class of objects that are not sets must be\nnon-empty). These results are again in agreement with actual usage,\nfor example in the model theory of first-order set theory, where the\nmembership predicate is taken as a non-logical constant. \n\nFrom the consideration of the examples provided by the theory of types\nand first-order set theory, Tarski extracts a conclusion that he\nwelcomed. This is the conclusion that, in a certain sense, the\ndistinction between logical and non-logical constants is relative to a\ncontext of investigation. Recall Tarski’s remarks about the sign for\nmembership in a letter of 1944. In the 1966 lecture Tarski says that\nmembership is a logical notion in some formalizations of the theory of\ntypes. He says: \n\nIt is a bit unclear that the “notions” of membership that Tarski talks\nabout are notions in the sense introduced by him earlier in the\nlecture. They do not “occur” in any type, given the standard\nformulations of the theory of types (even in formulations in which a\nsign for membership is used), for they are relations among objects of\ndifferent types, which do not occur in a non-cumulative hierarchy. But\nTarski is perhaps thinking of some non-standard, cumulative type\nhierarchy. Under a suitable expansion of the concept of a notion, the\nnotions of membership Tarski has in mind will indeed be invariant\nunder permutations of any universe, and hence logical; and the sign or\nsigns for these notions of membership will be Tarskian logical\nconstants. On the other hand, as pointed out above, membership as a\nrelation over the domain of individuals and sets will not be a logical\nnotion in that domain, and hence the sign for this concept of\nmembership will not be a Tarskian logical constant. Thus,\ninterestingly, Tarski’s definition of the concept of logical constant\nrespects in a sense his early relativistic view in the paper on\nlogical consequence. Tarski describes the situation in the following\npassage: Tarski’s papers are reprinted and collected in Tarski (1986b). The\nvolume Tarski (1983a) contains widely used English translations of his\nmain papers of the 1920s and 1930s. Givant (1986) gives a complete\nbibliography of Tarski’s publications until 1986. Feferman and\nFeferman (2004) is a biography of Tarski that also contains a very\nvaluable introduction to his logical and mathematical work, including\ndescriptions of all the results and developments mentioned in the\ninitial paragraph of this entry. On Tarski’s logical work see also\nSimmons (2009) and Eastaugh (2017). McFarland, McFarland and Smith (2014) contains a\nwealth of biographical and historical information about Tarski, as\nwell as updates to Givant’s bibliography and translations into English\nof a number of previously untranslated early texts by Tarski. Collections of articles devoted to (parts of) Tarski’s work\ninclude: vols. 51 (1986) and 53 (1988) of the Journal of Symbolic\nLogic; Woleński and Köhler (1999); vols. 126 (2001) and\n142 (2004) of Synthese; vols. 126 and 127 of the\nAnnals of Pure and Applied Logic (2004); and Patterson\n(2008a). Patterson (2012) is a book-length historical and\nphilosophical study of many of Tarski’s philosophical ideas, focusing on truth and logical consequence. Gruber (2016) is a book-length commentary of Tarski’s monograph on truth, “The Concept of Truth in Formalized Languages”, which compares the Polish original version, the German translation, and the English version of the German text. There is a considerable bibliography on critical and exegetical\naspects of Tarski’s philosophical work. The bibliography on truth is\nespecially extensive. It includes the chapters on Tarski’s theory of\ntruth in Coffa (1991), Kirkham (1992), Soames (1999) and (2010), and\nKünne (2003), the second part of Woleński (1999), the papers\nField (1972), Davidson (1973, 1990), Kripke (1975), Church (1976),\nSoames (1984), Putnam (1985), Hodges (1985/6, 2004, 2008), McGee\n(1993), García-Carpintero (1996), Heck (1997), Murawski (1998),\nDeVidi and Solomon (1999), Ketland (1999), Milne (1999), Sher (1999),\nGómez-Torrente (2001, 2004), Eklund (2002), Gupta (2002),\nRojszczak (2002), Raatikainen (2003), (2008), Ray (2003, 2005, 2018),\nSundholm (2003), Feferman (2004a), Frost-Arnold (2004), Hintikka\n(2004), Patterson (2004, 2008b), Azzouni (2005, 2008), Horwich (2005),\nBurgess (2008), David (2008), Mancosu (2008), Simons (2008), Asay\n(2013), Schiemer and Reck (2013), Loeb (2014), Barnard and Ulatowski (2016), Smith (2017), and the entries on the\n liar paradox,\n model theory, \n Tarski: truth definitions, and \n truth. The critical and exegetical bibliography on Tarski on logical\nconsequence includes the corresponding chapter in Kneale and Kneale\n(1962), Etchemendy (1988, 1990, 2008), McGee (1992, 2004),\nGómez-Torrente (1996, 1998/9, 2008, 2009), Ray (1996),\nSher (1996), Hanson (1997), Sagüillo (1997), Chihara (1998),\nShapiro (1998), Schurz (1999), Blanchette (2000), Bays (2001), Edwards\n(2003), Jané (2006), Mancosu (2006, 2010), and the entries on\n logical consequence and\n logical truth.
