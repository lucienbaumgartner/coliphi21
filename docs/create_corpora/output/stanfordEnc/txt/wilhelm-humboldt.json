Although there has always\nbeen strong interest in Humboldt expressed by political and cultural\nhistorians and educationists in Germany, it is only in recent decades\nthat his contributions to the formation of modern linguistics, to\nsemiotics, hermeneutics and philosophy of language have given rise to\nrenewed attention to his pioneering achievements in these areas, even\nthough much of his work in linguistics has remained unknown or\nunexplored until recently. Yet numerous linguists beginning with Pott\nand Steinthal in Germany and the American Brinton in the nineteenth\ncentury to Boas, Sapir, Bühler, Weisgerber, and Chomsky in the\ntwentieth century derived or claimed to have derived important\ninsights from Humboldt. But their interest in Humboldt was partial at\nbest and limited to those aspects of his work that could be utilized\nto reinforce or to legitimize their own projects and methodologies. It\nis quite misleading to associate the term “Humboldtian\nlinguistics” or “Humboldtian philosophy of language”\nwith any one specific direction, for example with the Whorfian thesis\nof “linguistic relativity” or with Chomsky’s opposite\nnotion of a universalist “generative grammar” because\nthese tend to ignore other equally or more important dimensions of\nHumboldt’s work. After his death in 1835 his linguistic work was\neffectively disregarded by mainstream linguists in Germany whose\nprimary interest was focused on the Indo-European language group. Thus\na prominent figure like Franz Bopp would maintain that the languages\nof the South Pacific represented but decayed forms of Sanskrit despite\nthe fact that Humboldt had already thoroughly disproved this opinion\nin his Kavi Work and demonstrated that these languages constituted\nwhat is called today the Austronesian language group (Mueller-Vollmer\n1991). Even the linguist Heyman Steinthal, who published in 1884 a two\nvolume edition of Humboldt’s writings entitled Die\nSprachphilosophischen Werke Wilhelm’s von Humboldt (Humboldt’s\nworks in philosophy of language) (see “Works”,\nbibliography), in his introduction and commentaries criticises\nHumboldt from a reductionist psychologistic position and neither here\nor anywhere in his other writings made a serious attempt to discuss\nHumboldt’s own arguments and to investigate his actual philosophical\nposition. In France, on the other hand, we find throughout the\nnineteenth century a comparatively sustained interest in Humboldt\nthat was confined chiefly to his work in the Asian languages and to\nhis Basque studies. As a member of the Société\nAsiatique in Paris he published a number of articles in the\nsociety’s official journal, the Journal Asiatique (for a list\nof these articles, see Bösch 2006, p. 234) and the latter in turn\ncarried reviews of some of his writings. It has to be noted that this\nFrench reception resulted largely from the personal contacts and\nscholarly exchanges that he maintained with a number of prominent\nFrench linguists such as Jean-François Champollion, Jean-Pierre\nAbel-Rémusat, Eugène Jacquet, and Eugène Burnouf.\nYet Humboldt’s French reception, while including some of his important\nlinguistic studies, all but omitted their philosophical concerns and\nunderlying principles. Typical is the review of Humboldt’s\ngroundbreaking treatise from 1827, “On the Dual” that\nappeared in the Nouvelle Revue Germanique, I: 378–381\n(1829), where the reviewer blended out entirely the philosophical\nintent and key argument of the piece (Ibid. 105/6) and thus distorted\nbeyond recognition Humboldt’s integration of linguistic research and\nphilosophy of language, which lies at the heart of his linguistic\nenterprise. It is only in the late twentieth century that the\nphilosopher of language and linguist Humboldt has been discovered in\nFrance by men like Henri Meschonic, Jean Rousseau or Denis Thouard\n(For their publications see, Bösch 2006, pp. 239f, 243f, and\n247f). Surprisingly, Humboldt’s name has been notoriously absent in\nthe extensive debates prompted by Jacques Derrida and his\nGrammatology concerning the role of writing (écriture)\nfor an understanding of language and culture and its alleged neglect\nin the Western tradition because of its inherent phonocentrism. For\nHumboldt had in effect produced, on the basis of his extensive study\nof the world’s different writing systems past and present, a\ncomprehensive theory of writing that does not fit into the rubrics of\nphonocentrism or eurocentrism. Writing constituted in his view an\nessential part of language, the material embodiment of the specific\nformative principle a language employs to construct meaning rather\nthan being the mere representational mirror of speech. For him, the\ndevelopment of language and writing were mutually dependent on each\nother (On this issue see the extensive and groundbreaking work by\nMessling 2008).\n\n\nThere was an early presence of Humboldtian ideas in American\nlinguistics and ethnology dating back to the early nineteenth\ncentury in which Humboldt himself had played an active role. Its\nbeginning is marked by Stephen S. Duponceau’s (1760–1844)\nprogrammatic report to the American Philosophical Society in\nPhiladelphia in 1819 on the study the American Indian languages in the\n“Transactions of the historical and literary committee of the\nAmerican Philosophical Society”, the founding document of\nAmerican linguistics, with its reference to Humboldt (Transactions\nof the historical and literary committee of the American Philosophical\nSociety, vol. 1, Philadelphia, 1819) and the ensuing\ncorrespondence between the two men. There is in addition Humboldt’s\nimportant correspondence with the second founder of American\nlinguistics, John Pickering (1777–1846) who wrote a lengthy\narticle on the American Indian languages for Francis Lieber’s\nEncyclopedia Americana where specific reference is made to\nHumboldt’s work (see Pickering 1831). Francis Lieber\n(1798–1872), the creator and editor of the Encyclopedia\nAmericana, besides corresponding with the German linguist,\nfollowed Humboldtian principles or what he understood of them in his\nown linguistic work on the American languages (see for example\nLieber’s “The Plan of Thought in American Languages”, in\nH. R. Schoolcraf’s History and Statistics of the Indian Tribes of\nthe United State, vol. ii, 346–349, Washington, 1853). The\nmost prominent American ethnologist and linguist of the second half of\nthe nineteenth century, Daniel G. Brinton (1837–1899) was\nwell acquainted with Humboldt’s work on the American Indian tongues,\nas far as it was known then. He viewed his own researches as following\nthe path that Humboldt had first laid out. There are references to\nHumboldt throughout his work, he translated an unpublished treatise of\nhis “On the American Verb System” and regarded him as\nfounder of “the Philosophy of Language” (Brinton 1890, p.\n332.). Yet what he and his followers understood by this term was\nconfined largely to the methodological principles that governed\nHumboldt’s typological and comparative studies and excluded essential\ndimensions and the actual philosophical concerns expressed in his\nwritings. \n\n\nA similar process of partial appropriation has been characteristic\nalso of the philosophers who paid serious attention to Humboldt’s\nviews, such as Ernst Cassirer (1923–29), Martin Heidegger (1927,\n1959), and more recently Bruno Liebrucks (1965), Hans-Georg Gadamer\n(1960, 1965, 1972), and Jürgen Habermas (1985, 1988, 1991). It is\nonly in the last decades that Humboldt’s philosophical and linguistic\nwritings have become a focal point of attention in their own right.\nLinguists of various orientations, philosophers, historians and\nliterary scholars of different nationalities alike have examined\nHumboldt’s philosophy and linguistic ideas by placing them into a\nvariety of different contexts.\n\nHumboldt’s father was of German middle class background whose family\nhad been granted the status of nobility with the title of\n“Freiherr” (Baron) in 1738 whereas his mother (maiden name\nde Colomb) was of middle class, mainly French Huguenot and\nGerman-Scottish extraction. Neither Wilhelm nor his younger brother\nAlexander (1769–1859) ever attended a public primary or\nsecondary school. Instead their father, and after his untimely death\nin 1779, their mother employed private tutors at the family estate in\nTegel who were recruited from among the leading figures of the Berlin\nEnlightenment scene. Among them were Joachim Heinrich Campe,\nwell-known educational writer, Ernst Ferdinand Klein and Christian von\nDohm, two leading political thinkers who brought enlightenment\norientation and ideas to the areas of constitutional law and public\npolicy. Johann Jakob Engel, the renowned philosopher and writer,\nintroduced the young Humboldt to modern and contemporary European\nphilosophy in the areas of logic, aesthetics, metaphysics and\nlanguage. \nWith Engel, Humboldt read and discussed works by Leibniz, Hume, Locke,\nHarris, Herder, Condillac and Rousseau. Yet at the same time both\nHumboldt brothers were deeply immersed in the study of the Greeks.\nWilhelm’s first publication (at the age of 19) dealt with Socrates and\nPlato’s idea of divinity (“Socrates und Plato über die\nGottheit”) in which he defended the enlightenment ideal of\nnatural religion. As adolescents the two brothers began frequenting\nthe literary salon of Markus and Henriette Herz in Berlin where they\ncame into contact with intellectual luminaries of the city. It was\nhere that Wilhelm first met Moses Mendelssohn’s eldest daughter\nBrendel Veit, the subsequent Dorothea Schlegel, Schiller’s future\nspouse Charlotte von Lengefeld and his own bride-to-be, Karoline von\nDacheröden. After only one disappointing semester at the narrow\nand provincial Prussian University at Frankurt-on-Oder, the Humboldt\nbrothers transferred to the University of Göttingen in 1788,\narguably the most distinguished University in all the German-speaking\nterritories at the time. Besides jurisprudence, Wilhelm studied\nclassical philology with Christian Gottlieb Heyne, natural science\nwith Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (who counted him “among the\nbrightest intellects” he had ever met), and immersed himself\ndeeply in the study of the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. In\nGöttingen he met and became friends with August Wilhelm Schlegel,\nGeorge Forster and the philosopher Friedrich Jacobi. In August 1789\nshortly after the outbreak of the French Revolution and accompanied by\nhis former teacher Campe, Wilhelm visited Paris, the Rhineland and\nSwitzerland and captured his observations in a travel journal that he\nkept (GS Vol 14: 76–236). In response to the challenge of the\nencounters with Forster and Jakobi, Humboldt was lead to articulating\nhis own philosophical position in “On Religion”\n(“Über Religion”, GS Vol 1: 45–76), his first\nimportant writing. \nAfter having successfully passed his examinations in jurisprudence, he\nentered the Prussian civil service in Berlin in January of 1790 and\nwas appointed councillor (Legationsrat) soon afterwards. But\nhe found the position and the prospects it entailed uninspiring and\nboring and already in May 1791 decided to take leave from the service.\nIn June he married Karoline von Dacheröden and spent the\nfollowing years on his wife’s family estates in Thuringia in the\nvicinity of Jena devoting his entire time and energy to his scholarly\nand philosophical pursuits while at the same time establishing\nlife-long personal and intellectual ties with the poets Johann\nWolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller. He also befriended the\nfamed Homeric scholar Friedrich August Wolf, author of the\nProlegomena ad Homerum, and debated politics and political\nphilosophy with the statesman and Archbishop-Elector of Mainz, Karl\nTheodor von Dalberg. In 1792 he spelled out his views on key issues of\nthe social and political philosophy of the period in a series of\narticles for the Berlinische Monatsschrift and for Schiller’s\njournal Neue Thalia. Among these were the “Ideas\nconcerning constitutions occasioned by the new French\nConstitution” and the programmatic “What should be the\nLimits of the Government’s Concern for the Well Being of its\nCitizens?” \nThese writings formed part of a book-length manuscript that, because\nof the fear of censorship for its radical liberal position, was\npublished only posthumously in 1851 under the title Versuch die\nGrenzen der Wirksamkeit des Staates zu bestimmen (Engl. transl.,\n1854: The Spheres and Duties of Government). It represents\nthe classical statement of the liberal humanist tradition in German\npolitical thought which, however, seems to have found a more\nappreciative readership in nineteenth century England (Matthew Arnold,\nJohn Stuart Mill), than in Humboldt’s native Germany. The Marxists\n(Lasalle) and conservative nationalists (Treitschke) alike rejected\nhis ideas and his staunch defense of the rights of the individual.\nJohn Stuart Mill, on the other hand, used a quote from Humboldt’s text\nas motto for his own treatise On Liberty. \nIn June 1794 Humboldt settled in Jena at a time when the city and its\nUniversity became the center of German idealist philosophy and the\nRomantic movement and entertained contacts with the philosopher Fichte\nand with Friedrich and August Wilhelm Schlegel. He assumed the role of\nphilosophical adviser and critical collaborator of Goethe and\nespecially Schiller. Through his discerning criticism he furthered the\nproduction of some of their important works, for example Schiller’s\nBriefe über die Ästhetische Erziehung des Menschen\nof 1795 (Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man), and his\nphilosophical poems as well as Goethe’s epic Herrmann und\nDorothea and his novel Wilhelm Meister. For Schiller’s\nnewly created journal, Die Horen, he authored two important\ncontributions, “Ueber den\nGeschlechts-Unterschied” (“On Sexual\nDifference”) where he formulated a gender theory on the basis of\ncontemporary natural philosophy and “Ueber männliche\nund weibliche Form” (“On the Male and Female\nForm”) where he extended this theory into the realm of the arts\nand culture (1794, 1795, GS Vol 1: 311–34, 335–69). While\nin Jena he joined forces with his brother Alexander and Goethe and\ntogether the three men engaged in a study of the evolving new\ndiscipline of comparative anatomy at the University. Humboldt used the\ninsights he had gained from this study to create a comprehensive\nblueprint for a future comparative anthropology (“Plan einer\nvergleichenden Anthropologie” (1797, GS Vol 1: 377–410).\nBut only years later when he attempted to lay the foundation for his\nnewly conceived discipline of general and comparative linguistics, he\nwould return to it and rework his ideas. \nGuided by his anthropological interests, however, Humboldt became\ninvolved in the problem of what constituted national character and how\nprecisely one could within the context of modern Europe determine its\nessential features. Thus in 1797 he composed an extensive study in a\ngenre of what we might call today “cultural and historical\ncriticism” entitled: Das achtzehnte Jahrhundert\n(The Eighteenth Century, GS Vol 2: 1–112). He would\nsoon have the opportunity to gather his own observations on those\nissues, when in the fall of 1797 he and his family moved to Paris\nwhere they would remain until the summer of 1801. This extended\nsojourn was interrupted by two extended journeys to Spain, from\nNovember 1799 to April 1800 and again in the spring and summer of\n1801, the purpose of the latter being a visit to the Basque country in\norder to study the Basque language and culture. \nDuring his Parisian sojourn Humboldt met and had contact with the\nforemost French politicians, scholars and intellectuals of the period\nsuch as Sieyès, Tracy, Roederer, Garat, Cabanis,\nDegérando, La Romiguière, Dupont de Nemours, Benjamin\nConstant and Madame de Staël whose literary salon he frequented.\nHe attended meetings of the Institut National (as the\nAcademie Française was called then) and debated\nKantian philosophy with the leading French philosophers (GS Vol 14:\n483–87), visited the theater regularly, and from a cultural\nanthropologist’s point of view, he observed and analyzed its different\nforms and varieties from the Comédie Française\nand the Théatre de la République to the\nVaudeville. Meanwhile he studied and commented upon\neffectively the entire canon of classical and modern,—i.e.,\neighteenth century—French literature and philosophy, for example\nRousseau, Diderot and Madame de Staël. His comments on these\nwriters and his astute critique of the philosophy of Condillac and his\nfollowers found in his Parisian diaries offer important clues for an\nunderstanding of his own philosophical position. Goethe meanwhile\npublished two essays by him on French theater and art in his journal\nDie Propyläen. Humboldt’s Parisian diaries reveal the\nextraordinary scope and intensity of his involvement with the complex\ncultural, social, political and cultural life-world of France under\nthe Directoire (GS Vol 14: 361–643; Vol 15:\n 1–46).[1] \nIn Paris, Humboldt completed his major work on aesthetics, his\nAesthetische Versuche I. Ueber Goethes Herrman und Dorothea\n(Essays in Aesthetics I. On Goethe’s Herrmann und Dorothea)\nin 1799. In the same year he also published in French for the benefit\nof Madame de Staël and her circle a concise summary of its major\narguments with emphasis on his new theory of the imagination in the\nParisian journal Magasin Encyclopédique. A decisive\nturning point in his intellectual career occurred with his discovery\nand pioneering investigations of the Basque language, an idiom whose\norigin and structure had defied hitherto all attempts at an\nexplanation by historians, philosophers and linguists following\nconventional methodologies. He disproved all existing theories about\nits descent and affiliation but instead of advancing new theories he\ndecided first to set out to study the language itself using all\npossible means at his disposal, from written documents, native\ninformants, statistics, historical, ethnological and sociological\ninformation to inventing and actually conducting what is known today\nas “field work”. His Basque studies coincided with his\nformulation of a new conception of language questioning and defying\nthe representational view of language that had been dominant in\nWestern thinking from Aristotle all the way to the empiricist and\nrationalist thinkers of his day. This new conception would find its\nexpression in Humboldt’s philosophy of language and linguistics that\nfrom this moment on became of central concern to him. \nFrom 1803 until the end of 1808 he served as Prussian envoy (Minister\nResident) to the Vatican in Rome, a post whose diplomatic chores he\ndispatched with skill and efficiency leaving him enough time for his\nown work. Besides his Basque studies he turned his attention again to\nancient Greek language and literature, translating from the poetry of\nPindar (Olympic Odes), Aischylos tragedy Agamemnon\nas well as smaller pieces from other authors (GS Vol 8: 3–270).\nThe introduction to his German version of Agamemnon includes\na succinct statement of his theory of translation where he formulated\na new approach to the problem of translation and developed concepts\nthat have been taken up again only in modern (Walter Benjamin) and\ncontemporary translation theories. But Humboldt’s life in the Eternal\nCity also lead him to reflect deeply about the fate of ancient culture\nand its history, a concern that found expression in his two essays\n“Latium und Hellas” 1806, and “Geschichte des\nVerfalls und Untergangs der griechischen Freistaaten”\n(“Latium and Hellas”, “History of the Decline and\nFall of the Greek Republics”) 1807–1808 (GS Vol 3:\n136–70; 171–218). Under the impact of Schiller’s untimely\ndeath in 1805 he composed the elegy “Rome” (published in\n1806), the best known of his poems. His stay in Rome unexpectedly\nadded yet another dimension to his linguistic interests that would\nbecome significant for his future linguistic research endeavors: the\nnative languages of the Americas. He had already asked his brother\nAlexander before he set sail for the New World to be on the lookout\nfor linguistic materials during his travels in South and Central\nAmerica. In Rome he had the opportunity to meet and befriend the\nformer chief of the Jesuit Missions in the Americas and head of the\nPapal Quirinal Library, the Spaniard Lorenzo Hervás\n(1753–1809). His new acquaintance was himself a renowned\nlinguist with whose work (for example his Catálogo des las\nlenguas de las naciones conocidas, 1787) Humboldt was already\nfamiliar. He was given the chance to consult and eventually to copy\nthe entire collection of Hervás’ extensive holdings of Native\nAmerican grammars and materials. These would form the basis for his\nown study of the American languages. While he was perusing his\nlinguistic researches, Humboldt’s residence in the Villa Gregoriana\nbecame a popular gathering place for the members of the European\nartist colony, which harbored figures like Bertel Thorwaldsen,\nChristian David Rauch, Gottlieb Schlick, Karl Ludwig Fernow and Johann\nGeorg Zoega. Among the European visitors who came to see Humboldt were\nMadame de Staël, August Wilhelm Schlegel and the English poet\nColeridge. Although he lost two of his sons in Rome (of the Humboldt’s\neight children three died at an early age) he considered the Roman\nyears as the happiest of his life. \nAfter Napoleon’s decisive victory at Jena and Auerstedt and the\nresulting collapse of Prussia Humboldt returned to Germany in the fall\nof 1808 and reluctantly accepted the position as head of the section\nfor ecclesiastic affairs and education in the ministry of the\ninterior. Yet in the short period from 1809 to 1810 he was able to\ninstitute a radical reform of the entire Prussian educational system\nfrom elementary and secondary school to the University which was based\non the principle of free and universal education. His idea of\ncombining both teaching and research in one institution that guided\nhim in establishing the University of Berlin in 1810 (today’s Humboldt\nUniversity) and the structures he created for this institution would\nbecome the model not only throughout Germany but also for the modern\nuniversity in most Western countries. Predictably, Humboldt soon ran\ninto difficulties with the established landed aristocracy in Prussia\nwhen he insisted that the University be endowed with landed property\nin order to insure its independence from the state and the changing\nwinds of politics. After quarreling with his superiors he was asked to\nresign his post and in 1810 was sent to Vienna as ambassador where,\nhowever, he soon became instrumental in convincing Austria to join the\nGrand Coalition of the European powers against Napoleon. But during\nthe initial diplomatic lull in Vienna he still found time for his\nlinguistic studies. His recently discovered Viennese note books\ncontain sketches of grammars for several South and Central American\nlanguages written in French that were intended to become part of his\nbrother’s American Travel account. In 1811 he produced his first\nextensive philosophical and methodological statement, the Essai\nsur les langues du Nouveau Continent (Essay on the languages\nof the New Continent) that was to introduce his study of the\nIndian grammars of the Americas (GS Vol 3: 300–341). \nDuring the negotiations for the first and second Paris peace treaty\nand subsequently at the Congress of Vienna he was successful in\ndefending Jewish rights but failed in his attempt to secure a liberal\nconstitution for the German Confederation (Deutscher Bund) to be based\non a statute of fundamental principles (Grundgesetz) that would have\nguaranteed the rights of all citizen. After representing Prussia at\nthe newly constituted Bundestag in Frankfurt on Main for a\nshort time, he was appointed Prussian ambassador to the Saint James\nCourt in London where, besides studying Sanskrit at the British Museum\nLibrary in his spare time, he was able, with the help of the Banking\nHouse of Rothschild, to organize a financial aid program for the\nreconstruction of the war-ravished Prussian economy. He returned to\nBerlin to the ministry of the Interior to head a committee to draft a\nnew Prussian constitution in 1819. But his carefully designed\ncomprehensive plan for introducing a liberal constitution (GS Vol 2:\n389–455) that would have transformed Prussia into a genuine\nconstitutional monarchy did not have a chance to be adopted. When\nHumboldt strongly resisted the repressive measures taken by the royal\ngovernment in the wake of the Karlsbad decrees and in the ensuing\nassault on civil liberties, King Friedrich Wilhelm III on New Years\nEve of 1819 summarily dismissed him from all his duties. His dismissal\nmarked not only the end of his political career but the de\nfacto elimination in Prussia of the chances for the development\nof a true civil society, the creation of democratic institutions and\nthus for the middle classes to participate actively in the political\nlife of the country. Aside from a prolonged visit to Paris and London\nin 1828, Humboldt spent the rest of his life at the family estate in\nTegel which he had renowned architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel remodel\nin classicist style. There he concentrated his energy on his scholarly\nand linguistic work. \nAlready in June 1820 he was able to submit to the Berlin Academy a\nbold plan for the creation of the new discipline of comparative\nlinguistics and to outline the philosophy and methodology on which it\nwas to be built in a paper entitled: “On the Comparative Study\nof Language and its Relation to the Different Periods of Language\nDevelopment” (“Ueber das vergleichende Sprachstudium\nin Beziehung auf die verschiedenen Epochen der\nSprachentwicklung”, GS Vol 4: 1–34). In this compact\nyet highly complex presentation he offered a brief summary of his\nprevious endeavors and proceeded to lay down the principles and the\nblueprint for a comprehensive research program that would guide his\nwork during the following years but at the same time defined the tasks\nof a future linguistics. Humboldt viewed the function of language as\nnot limited simply to representing or communicating existing ideas and\nconcepts but as “formative organ of thought” (das\nbildende Organ des Gedankens, GS Vol 6: 152) and thus\ninstrumental also in the production of new concepts that would not\ncome into being without it. The differences between languages for him\nwere not those of “sounds and signs” (Schällen\nund Zeichen) but ultimately of “differences of representing\nthe world” (Verschiedenheit der Weltansichten), GS Vol\n4: 27. Therefore it seemed obvious to Humboldt that a categorical\nseparation between philosophy of language and empirical linguistics as\nit developed during the nineteenth century and still exists today, was\nunacceptable. For not only could there be no discipline of linguistics\nwithout a conceptual base and firm philosophical grasp of its\nmany-faceted object of inquiry but, Humboldt maintained, empirical\nresearch into actual language use in different languages with quite\ndiverging structures would provide the philosopher with concrete\ninsights into the nature of human language that would otherwise not be\nattainable. One is reminded here of Kant’s dictum that “concepts\nwithout intuition” (Anschauung, i.e., empirical\ncontent) “are empty and that intuitions without concepts are\nblind.” \nHis wide-ranging and ambitious empirical investigations into the\ncosmos of human languages covered practically the entire globe.\nAlexander von Humboldt said about his brother that it had been granted\nto him \nto penetrate more deeply into the structure of a larger number of\nlanguages as probably have ever been grasped by one human mind.\n(Humboldt 1836: viii) \nBut Humboldt did not labor by himself in isolation, as some of his\ninterpreters have claimed to this very day, but communicated with and\nentertained lively contacts with leading scholars in both Europe and\nAmerica: with, for example, Franz Bopp in Berlin, August Wilhelm\nSchlegel in Bonn, Jean-François Champollion and Jean-Pierre\n Rémusat[2]\n in Paris, Alexander Johnston in London and Peter S. Du Ponceau and\nJohn Pickering in Philadelphia and Boston in the United States.\nHumboldt himself has utilized and understood his correspondence with\nthe leading scholars of the world as an integral part of his ongoing\nresearch work. \nHe managed, with the help of his brother Alexander initially, to\nacquire what was probably the largest collection of linguistic\nmaterials in Europe for his time. There was in effect no language\ngroup on the globe that did not attract his attention. Among the\nEuropean and Indo-European languages Humboldt knew and studied\nclassical Greek and Latin, Sanskrit, all of the Romance languages,\nEnglish, Basque, Old Icelandic, Lithuanian, Polish, Slovenian,\nSerbo-Croatian, Armenian but also Hungarian. He was familiar with\nHebrew, Arabic and Coptic (of which he wrote a grammar). From among\nthe Asian languages he studied Chinese, Japanese, Siamese and Tamil.\nYet in the center of his work stood, besides Basque (he is considered\nthe founder of Basque Studies), the native languages of South, Central\nand North America, and increasingly from 1827–28 the languages\nof the Pacific from the East Coast of Africa to Hawai‘i and the South\nSea Islands. These form what we call today the Austronesian language\ngroup whose existence Humboldt was the first to demonstrate\nconclusively. Among the papers in his remains we find studies, notes,\nanalyses, observations and materials relating to well over two hundred\nlanguages. In his private and public life he mastered and used\n(besides his native German) French, English, Italian and Spanish. \nA self-imposed commitment to report on the progress of his research\nefforts to the Berlin Academy at regular intervals induced him to\ndevise his own specific style of presentation that allowed him freely\nand creatively to combine elements of the philosophical essay with\nthose of a scholarly exposition. Among the important of his academy\naddresses marking the progress and direction of his investigations\nbelong his “On the Task of the Historian”\n(“Ueber die Aufgabe des Geschichtsschreibers”) of\n1821 (GS Vol 4: 35–56); “On the Origin of Grammatical\nForms and their Influence on the Development of Ideas”\n(“Ueber das Entstehen der grammatischen Formen und ihren\nEinfluss auf die Ideeentwicklung”) of 1822 (GS Vol 4:\n285–313); “On Alphabetic Script and its Relation to the\nStructure of Language” (“Ueber die Buchstabenschrift\nund ihren Zusammenhang mit dem Sprachbau”) of 1824 (GS Vol\n5: 107–133); “On the Grammatical Structure of the Chinese\nLanguage” (“Ueber den grammatischen Bau der\nChinesischen Sprache”) of 1826 (GS Vol 5: 309–325);\n“On the Dual Form” (“Ueber den\nDualis”) of 1827 (GS Vol 6: 4–30); “On the\nLanguages of the South Sea Island” (“Ueber die\nSprachen der Südseeinseln”) of 1828 (GS Vol 6:\n37–51); and two presentations on the Indian Bhagavad-Gita poem\n(Ueber die Bhagavd-Gita) of 1826 (GS Vol 5: 158-89; 325-44).\nThese and his other presentations formed part of the published\nproceedings of the Berlin Academy. \nHis paper “On the Task of the Historian”, besides dealing\nwith the problems the historian has to confront in writing history,\noffers a theory of historical research that is augmented by\nobservations on the nature of historical understanding. The piece\noccupies a special place in the development of the hermeneutics of the\nhuman sciences. The historian Droysen called Humboldt “the Bacon\nof the historical sciences” in his influential Historik\n(theory of historical studies) and some of his own concepts and\ndistinctions echo Humboldt’s formulations (Droysen 1958: 324). Whereas\nDroysen speaks of the method of the historian as “understanding\nby investigation” (forschendes Verstehen), Humboldt\nsets off historical understanding from mere deductive rational\nprocedures by calling it an assimilation of the investigative\ncapability (forschende Kraft) and the object under\ninvestigation (GS Vol 4: 39). Furthermore, with his notion of a\n“preexisting basis of understanding”\n(“vorgängige Grundlage des Begreifens”) Humboldt\nclearly anticipated Heidegger’s and Gadamer’s respective notions of an\nontological or historical pre-understanding as necessary condition of\nall formal understanding and interpretation in the human sciences (GS\nVol 4: 48), even though Gadamer in his Truth and Method\ngravely misrepresents the hermeneutic dimensions of Humboldt’s thought\nomitting the fact that for Humboldt (and Schleiermacher) understanding\nwas grounded in language and linguisticality and was perceived by them\nas the correlative of the act of speaking. \nIn 1830 Humboldt edited and published his correspondence with the poet\nSchiller and included a lengthy essay “On Schiller and the Path\nof his Intellectual Development” (“Ueber Schiller und\nden Gang seiner Geistesentwicklung”, GS Vol 6:\n492–527). In the same year appeared also an extensive essay on\nthe late Goethe in the form of a review of the concluding part of the\npoet’s Italian Journey that had been published the previous\nyear. There he attempted, as he had done before in his Schiller essay,\nto interpret the various sides of the poet from one central point of\nview: this time from the poet’s perception of art and nature\n(“Rezension von Goethes Zweitem römischen\nAufenthalt”, GS Vol 6: 528–550). During the remainder\nof his life most of his time and energy was spent on what was to be\nhis magnum opus: a monumental study of the Kavi Language on\nthe island of Java within the context of the entire Austronesian\nlanguage group of the Pacific. But he was only able to complete the\n“Introduction” and Book 1 of the work. His\nresearch associate Buschmann published these parts in 1836,\nconstituting the first volume of what came to be known as Humboldt’s\nKawi Werk (Kavi-Work). Buschmann also edited and\npublished the remaining two volumes in 1838 and 1839. About this work\nthe American linguist Bloomfield wrote: \nThe second volume of Humboldt’s great treatise founded the comparative\ngrammar of the Malayo-Polynesian language family. (Bloomfield 1933:\n19) \nAt the behest of Alexander von Humboldt, who had written a\n“Preface” to the entire work, a separate edition of the\n“Introduction” was brought to publication to serve as a\nmemorial to the deceased, its text shortened and adjusted by the\neditor to its new purpose which made it appear as an independent\ntreatise containing a summary of Humboldt’s theoretical views on\nlanguage. Therefore, the word “Introduction” was dropped\nfrom its title altogether: The Diversity of Human\nLanguage-Structure and its Influence on the intellectual and spiritual\nDevelopment of Mankind (Ueber die Verschiedenheit des\nmenschlichen Sprachbaus und seinen Einfluss auf die geistige\nEntwickelung des Menschengeschlechts) (Berlin, 1836). This text,\noften confused with the “Introduction” proper or even with\nthe whole work, became the single most important text for the Humboldt\nreception throughout the nineteenth and much of the twentieth\n century.[3]\n While in this text Humboldt elaborated broadly on his understanding\nof language and human speech, it is no longer evident that he intended\nit as a clearing of the ground for the large-scale empirical\ninvestigations that were to make up the body of the work. Yet from a\nstrictly philosophical perspective this text does not measure up in\nits organization, articulation of issues or its philosophical\nstringency to some of Humboldt’s earlier posthumous treatises. These,\nhowever, were not published until the twentieth century. Among these\ngroundbreaking works (of which no English translations yet exist) must\nbe counted the Grundzüge des allgemeinen Sprachtypus\n(Fundamentals of the Linguistic Prototype) and Vom\ngrammatischen Baue der Sprachen (On the Grammatical Structure\nof Languages). It is only in the light of twentieth century\nlinguistics, anthropology and philosophy, that is, after Saussure,\nCassirer, Jakobson, Whorf, Chomsky and Wittgenstein, that the true\nscope of Humboldt’s linguistic philosophy has become visible and its\nactuality been perceived. During the nineteenth century Humboldt was\nfor the representatives of the academically established discipline of\nlinguistics with its positivistic historicist and strictly\nIndo-European orientation nothing but the odd man out. What separated\nhim from the mainstream was his philosophically grounded understanding\nof language and linguistics and his decidedly non-Eurocentric\norientation, which preserved the enlightenment Universalist tradition\nby providing it with a new philosophical base. \nBefore he died Humboldt bequeathed his entire collection of linguistic\nmaterials, including his own manuscripts, to the Royal Prussian\nLibrary in Berlin so that it would be accessible to the public for\nfurther research. Yet soon after his death in 1835 the integrity of\nthe collection was violated, its contents were divided and dispersed\nand many items sent to different locations. Thus some of Humboldt’s\nbooks, with his marginal comments and annotations, could still be\nfound in general circulation in libraries of the former East Germany.\nIt was also wrongly believed until recently that the greater part of\nthe collection, including Humboldt’s own manuscripts, was destroyed in\nBerlin or otherwise lost during the last months of World War 2.\nThroughout the nineteenth and most of the twentieth centuries with few\nexceptions, his papers did not attract the curiosity of professional\nlinguists whose attention was focused mainly on Indo-European\nlanguages. Astonishingly, the extensive body of his posthumous works\nand papers was not ever systematically examined or properly\ncatalogued, let alone studied in depth until recently. As a\nconsequence, all existing editions have virtually excluded Humboldt’s\nempirical work, a situation that will be remedied with the appearance\nof the comprehensive critical edition of Humboldt’s linguistic works\nthat is under way (Humboldt 1994–). \nReflecting the extraordinary range of his intellectual interests and\nconcerns, the corpus of Humboldt’s writings consists of a wide\nspectrum of diverse types and genres of texts of which only a small\nportion was ever published during his lifetime. Until this day all\neditions of his works have remained incomplete. His texts consist of\nphilosophical reflections, fragments, studies of varying types and\nlength, notes, diaries, as well as entire treatises and monographs\nwith themes ranging from political theory, anthropology, aesthetics,\neducational theory, literature and history to hermeneutics, ethnology,\nand last but not least, to philosophy of language and linguistics. Not\nto be omitted are the political memoranda produced at the time\nHumboldt held public office, many of which must be counted among his\noutstanding literary and intellectual achievements. There is in\naddition also a sizable corpus of translations from the works of\nLucretius, Pindar, Aeschylus, Aristophanes and others (GS Vol 8) and\nof non-Western works such as the Bhagavad Gita as well as his\nown poetic productions (GS Vol 9). Last but not least, must be\nconsidered Humboldt’s extensive and extraordinarily rich\ncorrespondence that he maintained with a large number of the important\npersonalities of the age throughout his entire life. Noteworthy among\nthese are his correspondence with his wife Caroline (7 vols.), his\nbrother Alexander, Franz Bopp, Karl-Gustav Brinkmann, Charlotte Diede\n(Briefe an eine Freundin), Friedrich Gentz, Johann Wolfgang\nvon Goethe, Henriette Herz, Friedrich Jacobi, Christian Gottfried\nKörner, Friedrich Schiller, August Wilhelm Schlegel, Germaine de\nStaël, Friedrich Welcker and Friedrich Wolf. An entire group of\nhis correspondence consists of exchanges with scholars in different\nparts of the world and is concerned with specific issues and problems.\nThe bulk of these communications can be found among his extant\nlinguistic papers where they have come down to us in the order in\nwhich Humboldt filed them. His political correspondence forms a\nseparate category and has been published as part of the Academy\nedition in GS Vol 16, 17. \nAmong his published writings only the Ideen zu einem Versuch die\nGrenzen der Wirksamkeit des Staats zu bestimmen (The Spheres\nand Duties of Government) 1792, the Aesthetische Versuche\nI (Essays on Aesthetics I) 1799, Prüfung der\nUntersuchungen über die Urbewohner Hispaniens (On the\nEarly Inhabitants of Spain) 1821, and the\nKawi-Einleitung (Introduction to the Kavi Language)\n1836, constitute complete works in the traditional sense. The majority\nof his writings consist of essays, articles or presentations produced\nfor specific occasions on the one hand and of a large body of\nsketches, studies, notes, expositions and entire treatises on the\nother. Humboldt used the medium of writing as a vehicle of\nintellectual exploration to untangle the complex and diverse aspects\nof a specific problem or set of problems rather than attempting to\nstate a fixed and definite position or opinion, and he would often\nbring to bear different view-points onto the matter at hand and\nutilize varying formulations. It is characteristic of his intellectual\nstyle that he would with consistent philosophical and methodological\nastuteness develop a specific type of questioning that made it\npossible for him to bring to view particular phenomena or sets of\nproblems in their inherent complexity. What lends a sense of unity to\nthe large variety of his writings devoted to so many different domains\nof knowledge, is his consistency in articulating questions, in\napplying a specific viewpoint and perspective, and a recurring use of\nspecific key concepts and their concomitant terminology. \nIn his essay “On Religion” (1789) Humboldt drew the\noutlines of a historical typology that would make it possible to study\nthe relationship between religion and state power from the Greek\ncity-states to present times and envisaged the purpose of the modern\nstate as enabling its citizens to realize fully their “human\nvocation” (Bestimmung als Mensch, GS Vol 1: S.54). It\nwould be necessary for this purpose, Humboldt thought, to accord a\npositive value to human sensuality and give it a freer and more\ncreative rein. Consequently, he rejected the traditional dualistic\nview of human nature with its mind/body dichotomy and the Cartesian\nnotion of the human spirit as a kind of ghost in the machine. Instead,\nhe maintained, mind and body form a vital unity and what we call\nspirit (Geist) for him was nothing but “the finest\nramification of sensuality.” The path to self-determination that\nKant had demanded in his moral philosophy must therefore proceed\nthrough the cultivation of man’s sensuality (Sinnlichkeit).\nHence the realm of aesthetics is granted a key function in any attempt\nto overcome the inherited mind/body dichotomy, in which Humboldt saw a\nmajor obstacle in the path of achieving individual self-determination.\nSchiller, in the central sections of his Letters on the Aesthetic\nEducation of Man of 1795 would take up Humboldt’s ideas. In the\ntwentieth century members of the Frankfurt School, such as Herbert\nMarcuse in his book Eros and Civilization, would infuse these\nideas with a renewed sense of relevancy and importance by linking them\nto Freudian psychology in their “Critical Theory” and\nphilosophy. In his two contributions for Schiller’s journal Die\nHoren, Humboldt took the additional step of characterizing sexual\ndifference as basic biological and anthropological givens of human\nculture and society. \nHis political writings from this period take issue with the eighteenth\ncentury absolutist idea of the state while at the same time offering a\ncritical analysis of the political situation in contemporary France.\nHumboldt tried to explain the unsuccessful attempts by the French\nNational Assembly to create a lasting constitution and civic order by\nits unrealistic absolutist reliance on principles of abstract reason.\nAs early as 1791 he predicted the fate of the new French constitution\nwhen he argued that “constitutions cannot be grafted upon human\nbeings as sprigs on a tree.” Where time and nature had not\nprepared the ground, he argued “it would be like tying blossoms\non trees with pieces of twine: the first sunlight at noon will scorch\nthem to death” (GS Vol 1: 80). In order to safeguard the freedom\nof the individual from government encroachment, Humboldt proposed to\nlimit the functions and the authority of the state. This included the\nstate’s endeavors to provide actively for the welfare of its citizens\nwhenever this would cripple or hinder the free development of the\nindividual’s own potential for self-realization. For the “true\nend of man”, Humboldt wrote, was “the highest and most\nharmonious development of his powers to a complete and consistent\nwhole”. To reach that goal, freedom was the indispensable\ncondition (GS Vol 1: 107). Yet the free development of the\nindividuals, their self-realization, or Bildung, their\n“self-culture”, as the American Transcendentalists would\ntranslate the term, for Humboldt necessarily implied a social and\npolitical dimension. Self-culture demanded “a manifold of\nsituations” (eine Mannigfaltigkeit der Situationen) for\nthe individual citizens, so that they would be able to enter freely\ninto relationships of association and cooperation with one another,\nbecause, Humboldt argued, humans can realize their potential as\nindividuals only in society. For this reason, Humboldt maintained, a\ngovernment should not be evaluated solely by its legal system that\ngranted freedom and liberty to its citizens but equally by how much\nand to what degree it helped assure the creation of such a manifold of\nsituations and opportunities for the individual citizens to develop\ntheir human capacities in actual reality. \nIn his Aesthetische Versuche I (Essays in Aethetics\nI) of 1799 Humboldt employed an unusual and original approach\nthat enabled him to combine successfully three different tasks, namely\na close interpretation of Goethe’s epic poem Hermann und\nDorothea, the laying of the foundations of a new aesthetics and\npoetics proceeding from Kantian transcendental principles and finally\nthe formulation of a theory of literature and literary genres. His\nstarting point is the question:  \nWhat makes it possible for an artist to produce aesthetic effects? (GS\nVol 2: 318)  \nCombining a Kantian questioning from the Critique of Judgment\nwith the performative model of the human mind presented by Fichte in\nhis Science of Knowledge (Wissenschaftslehre),\nHumboldt advanced a theory of the imagination\n(Einbildungskraft) that enabled him to explain aesthetic\neffects as an interactive process involving the triad of artist, work\nof art and recipient.  \nArt in its most basic sense is to be understood as the transformation\nof what is real into an image (Das Wirkliche in ein Bild zu\nverwandeln, GS Vol 2: 126, de transformer en image ce qui,\ndans la nature est réel”, GS Vol 1: 1). The art of\nthe poet, more specifically, “consists in his ability or\ncompetence (Fertigkeit) to render the imagination creative\naccording to rules”, to incite the imagination through the\nimagination (GS Vol 2: 127) and thereby create “a live act of\ncommunication” (lebendige Mitteilung) (GS Vol 2: 132).\nAmong all the arts poetry occupies a special position in Humboldt’s\nview, because the material from which it is fashioned is not like\nordinary material, as the stone or marble the sculptor uses, but\ninstead consists of something already endowed with form, namely\nlanguage. Poetry therefore “is art through language”.\nThrough his imagination the poet creates works that represent “a\nworld” embodying a totality of their own that differs in\nprinciple from the world of reality. In his definition of art Humboldt\nno longer looks at artworks as objects in order to gather from them a\nlist of quasi objective qualities from which the nature of art could\nthen be derived, but instead focuses on the process of aesthetic\nproduction and the rules by which it is governed and on how these\nrules are revealed in the poet’s art. In other words, a generative one\nhas replaced the traditional mimetic or objective concept of art.  \nSubsequently, in his linguistics and philosophy of language Humboldt\nwould advance a similar generative view of human language and speech.\nBecause he understood linguistic form as procedural rule and\ndirection, as forma formans, (Form von Form, GS Vol\n5: 455) rather than as some kind of material shape or fixed objective\nentity (Form von Materie), the structure and organization of\na language for him could not be gathered from the actual verbal forms\nof its construction, its grammar. It was to be obtained rather from an\nanalysis of the procedures language employs in its generation of\nspeech (Verfahrensweise der Sprache bei der Erzeugung der\nRede). For, as Humboldt put it \n… language in actuality only exists in spoken discourse, its\ngrammar and dictionary are hardly even comparable to its dead skeleton\n(Die Sprache liegt nur in der verbundenen Rede, Grammatik und\nWörterbuch sind kaum ihrem todten Gerippe vergleichbar, GS\nVol 6: 147) \nHow such an analysis of the process of speech production is to\nproceed, what it encompasses, what it is able to achieve and how it\nwill enable the linguist to study and describe different natural\nlanguages, Humboldt has discussed in great depth and detail in several\nof his larger linguistic treatises, as for example in his\nFundamentals of the Linguistic Prototype (Grundzüge\ndes allgemeinen Sprachtypus, GS Vol 5: 400ff.)  \nTo understand his approach to linguistics and to appreciate the\nempirical linguistic investigations that will follow from it, it is\nnecessary to take a closer look at his conception of language at its\nformative stage where philosophy and linguistics intersect in a\ndistinct manner. During Humboldt’s Jena period the problem of the\nrelationship between thinking, language and reality that seemed to\nhave been settled once and for all by rationalist (Descartes, Leibniz)\nand empiricist (Locke, Condillac) thinkers alike, became an open\nquestion again for Humboldt, who looked at it from the new perspective\nthat Kantian and Fichtean philosophy had opened up. In 1795 he wrote a\nseries of sixteen theses on On Thinking and Speaking\n(Ueber Denken und Sprechen, GS Vol 7: 581–83) in\nresponse to a recent essay by Fichte “On the origin of language\nand human language ability”. In this, his first major statement\non language, he takes issue with the concept of the linguistic sign,\nwhich had been one of the cornerstones of seventeenth and\neighteenth-century philosophy of language. In both the rationalist and\nempiricist schools of thought it was assumed that signs constituted a\nspecial class of objects outside the mind existing independently from\nit to which convenient labels agreed upon by society had been\nattached. The relationship of these signs to the mental ideas they\nwere supposed to represent were therefore understood as\n“arbitrary” or “conventional”. Although\nempiricists and rationalists agreed that speaking required the use of\nsigns and that without them mental operations whether they derived\nfrom sensations or not were not possible, they were unable to explain\nas Herder had put it, how “the sound of roundness was able to\nrepresent the idea of roundness”. But Herder himself had not\nbeen able to advance a plausible solution to the problem, either, even\nthough he connected the origin of language with reflection\n(Besonnenheit), claiming that it was through reflection that\nhumans had first created language.  \nHumboldt’s approach differs radically from that of his predecessors.\n“The Nature of thinking consists in reflecting”, he states\nin thesis 1, “that is, in the act by which the thinking subject\ndifferentiates itself from its thought” (im Unterscheiden\ndes Denkenden vom Gedachten). This basic fact that every person\ncan easily verify by performing such an act is the starting point of\nHumboldt’s deliberations. Now, to reflect we must in our mind\narrest the continuous flow of impressions in order to concentrate on\nsomething, comprehend this something as a separate “unit”\n(Einheit), and set it as an object over against our thinking\nactivity (thesis 2). As a next step, the mind can now proceed to\ncompare several of these “units”, divide and combine them\nin different ways. In drawing the conclusion (thesis 4) from this\nstate of affairs, Humboldt lays the ground for a radically new notion\nof the sign that anticipates (and points beyond) Saussure’s definition\ngiven in his Cours de Linguistique Générale.\nThinking consists for Humboldt \nin segmenting its own process, thereby forming whole units out of\ncertain portions of its activity, and in setting these formations\nseparately in opposition to one another, collectively, however, as\nobjects, in opposition to the thinking subject. \nIn other words, in this process of segmentation not only are different\nobjects are created, but with it the very subject of this thinking\nactivity constitutes itself. Up to this point we seem to have been\nmoving very much along the lines of Fichte’s\nWissenschaftslehre—the “I” positing itself\nin the act of thinking—but in thesis 5, Humboldt’s argumentation\ntakes a sudden Kantian turn: \nNo thinking, not even the purest, can occur without the aid from the\ngeneral forms of our sensibility (allgemeinen Formen unsrer\nSinnlichkeit); only through them can it be apprehended and, as it\nwere, arrested. \nWhat Humboldt is saying, then, is that the mental acts he has\ndescribed would not have been possible without assistance from the\ngeneral forms of our sensibility. But how precisely do they make these\nacts possible? Thesis 6 offers an unexpectedly suspenseful answer that\nbuilds up to its culmination in the very last word which is:\n“language”: \nThe sensory designations of those units, into which certain portions\nof our thinking are united, in order to be opposed as parts to other\nparts of a greater whole as objects to the subjects, is called in the\nbroadest sense of the word: language (Sprache). \nWhat Humboldt describes here is a dual process of segmentation: that\nof the mental stream of impressions and a corresponding one of sensory\norder, exactly what linguists today refer to as the “principle\nof double articulation” (Martinet 1963: 22f). Through reflection\nwe single out “certain portions” from the unending and\namorphous flow of impressions and mental images while at the same time\nimposing an order upon them. This imposition of order is the work of\nthe sensory medium of language: word sounds function as structured\nunits (Einheiten) through which we discern and secure the\nmental units in the flow of impressions and images. Human speech,\ntherefore, is no longer seen by Humboldt as applying and manipulating\na fixed system of arbitrary signs as was assumed by both rationalists\nand empiricists, but consists rather of the operation of joining\ntogether these two different sets of orders: that of the articulated\nsound, the signifier, and that of the “thought” or\nsignified. Over a century later Saussure in his Cours de\nLinguistique Générale would define language and the\nlinguistic sign with almost the same words. What constituted language,\naccording to Saussure, was \nthe somehow mysterious fact that the thought-sound implies the\ndivisions which are the ultimate units of linguistics. Sound and\nthought can be combined only by means of these units. (1916/1968:\n252–3) \nIt is Humboldt who deserves the credit for having first discovered the\ntriadic nature of the linguistic sign: Signification (speaking) is\ndefined by him as the synthesis (Saussure’s combination) of\nsound and idea—Ton and Vorstellung. \nBut there is yet another important facet in Humboldt’s account that is\nlacking in Saussure and that Humboldt already had referred to in\nthesis 5. There he had shown the act of language production, or\nArticulation to be at one and the same time the constitutive\nact for the consciousness of self of the speaking individual. Thus\nthere arises in the act of speaking the distinction between subject\nand object as mutually constitutive correlatives of this act.\nSubsequently, in thesis 7 we learn that besides the linguistic and\nepistemological angle there is still an anthropological side to this\nprocess. For language begins simultaneously with “the first act\nof reflection”, Humboldt argues, and \nprecisely when man awakens from the stupor of desire (Dumpfheit\nder Begierde), in which the subject devours the object, to\nself-consciousness, the word is there also the first impulse, as it\nwere, which man gives himself to stand still, to look around and to\norient himself. \nHis notion of the rise of human self-consciousness is therefore quite\nthe opposite of Hobbes’ and particularly Hegel’s view as depicted by\nthe latter in the life and death struggle of the master/slave\ndialectics in his Phenomenology of the Spirit. For Humboldt\nit is language instead that serves as the civilizing force leading the\nindividual to self-consciousness and societal interaction and thus\ninvolves a positive relation to the other. In his later linguistic\nwritings, discussed below, he developed a communicative model of human\nspeech that can be seen as an extension and transformation of the\nFichtean concept of the intersubjective “I”. In the\ntwentieth century the philosopher Jürgen Habermas attempted to\nincorporate Humboldt’s model in his theory of communicative action.\n \nHumboldt’s notion of articulation first introduced in his\n“On Thinking and Speaking” of 1795 formed the theoretical\nbasis also for his empirical work into the phonemic structures of\nnatural languages where his research anticipated modern linguists’,\ne.g., Trubetzkoy’s and Jakobson’s, conception of phonology. Already in\n1795 he drew a clear distinction between the physical sound of nature\non the one hand and the “articulated” sounds that\nconstitute language on the other. In his empirical studies he\ndiscovered that the latter alone would form a clearly discernible\n“unit” (scharf zu vernehmende Einheit), capable\nof embodying features to allow these sounds to enter into specific\nrelationships with each other and any other sound (GS Vol 7: 67). What\nthis means is that for Humboldt, the individual sound of a given\nlanguage can be formed only “in relation to the others”\n(in Beziehung auf die übrigen) that make up the entire\n“sound system” (Lautsystem) of that language (GS\nVol 7: 67). He thought it possible and desirable to set up schemata\naccounting for the different classes of phonemes\n(Buchstabenlaute) found in the world’s languages, and the\ndifferent relationships into which these may enter according to their\naffinities (Verwandtschaft) or their mutual opposition\n(“in Verschiedenheit einander\ngegenüberstellen” GS Vol 7: 69). In working with over\na dozen native South and Central American languages, Humboldt created\none such schema enabling him to describe and to compare the phonetic\nsystems of these different\n languages.[4] \nIf linguistic signs no longer function as instruments for\ncommunicating independently existing thoughts and ideas from one mind\nto another, as Descartes, his followers and the empiricists believed,\nthis raises the question of how individuals can communicate with each\nother through language, a question that becomes even more urgent if,\nas Humboldt maintained, states of consciousness cannot be transmitted\nfrom one individual to another at all, for “there can be nothing\nin our mind than that which is the result of its own activity”\n(eigne Thätigkeit) (GS Vol 5: 382). However, any\ncommunication between individuals presupposes a shared foundation:\n“We understand the word we hear only, because we could have said\nit ourselves” (GS Vol 5: 382). The words we hear and those that\nwe utter are the stimuli for our language capacity to generate\nparticipatory responses. However, shared language capacity and\nlinguistic competence cannot guarantee that one individual understands\nwhat the other is saying. Only through dialogue with the other can\nthey test their understanding, amend and correct it, if necessary.\nEvery understanding is therefore also a non-understanding, Humboldt\nargued. Thinking, in other words, is by its very nature tied to man’s\nsocial existence which means that it requires “a Thou that\ncorresponds to the I”. A concept, Humboldt argued, can attain\nits distinctness and clarity only through its being reflected back\nfrom the intellect of another person (einer fremden\nDenkkraft, GS Vol 5: 380) with language as the only mediator\nbetween one intellect and another. At this point it becomes evident\nhow radically Humboldt’s linguistic philosophy and his language\nstudies part company with the traditional Cartesian way of\nunderstanding language. There existed for him a communicative\nprototype of human speech that is embedded in the structure of\nlanguage itself manifesting itself in the different languages. This\n“prototype of all language” (Urtypus aller\nSprachen) finds expression through the personal pronoun, that is,\nby the differentiation between the second and the third person. All\nspeech is directed at someone and its structure cannot be understood\nby applying Cartesian grammatical analysis to it, because from a\nlogical and grammatical point of view, it makes no difference whether\nI use the first, second or third personal pronoun, when in each case\nthese pronouns function as the subject of a sentence. But for Humboldt\nI and he really are different entities, and with them, he argued, all\npossibilities are exhausted: because they constitute the I and the\nnot-I. Thou is also a not I but unlike he, not in the “sphere of\nall beings”, but rather in another sphere of common action and\ninteraction. In his empirical investigations Humboldt therefore paid\nspecial attention to the system of personal pronouns in a given\nlanguage because it was from there that one could reconstruct the\nspecific manifestation of the prototypal speech situation. Following\nthis line of research in his Academy addresses “On the Dual\nForm” (1827) and “On the Relationship of the Adverbs of\nPlace with the Pronoun in some Languages” (1829) Humboldt\nanalyzed several dozen languages of different language groups from\naround the globe. It is in these texts that the marriage of philosophy\nof language and empirical linguistics that characterizes his work, can\nbest be studied.  \nCartesian linguistics is intimately connected with the notion of\nUniversal or Philosophical Grammar and, given its revival in Chomsky’s\ngenerative approach to language and his naming of Humboldt as one of\nhis immediate precursors, Humboldt’s relation to this tradition needs\nto be clarified. First of all, Humboldt was decidedly critical of all\nattempts to construct a system of Philosophical Grammar supposedly\nunderlying all natural languages, because it was patterned after the\nconcepts of Latin and French grammar and in practice had resulted in\nthe writing of grammars that violated the nature of the Non-European\nlanguages by forcing them into the procrustean bed of a Western\nsystem, whose categories were completely alien to their own inherent\nstructures (GS Vol 5: 355). He did not, however, reject the idea of\nlinguistic universals. On the contrary, these constituted the backbone\nof his concept of linguistic variety, the fact namely that each\nlanguage by its structure and formation was able to represent a\nspecific view of the world (Weltansicht). With Kant he\nbelieved in the universality of the mental structures and Kantian\ncategories represented for him the rules and the laws of thinking that\nwere ultimately responsible also for the rule systems that govern our\nlinguistic utterances. But he rejected the idea that these structures\nwere themselves already a kind of logical grammar from which a\nPhilosophical Grammar could directly be deduced. Therefore, the\ncomparative study of the languages required some new kind of Universal\nGrammar to serve as tertium comparationes for the linguist\nnot to lose himself in endless and aimless comparisons. Hence he\nreplaced the traditional principles with a radically different\nconception that he had derived from his work in comparative anatomy at\nJena in 1794: the notion of type, used first in his Plan for a\nComparative Anthropology of 1795 and which he now adapted to the\nstudy of language. As the title of his treatise Fundamentals of\nthe Linguistic Prototype (Grundzüge des allgemeinen\nSprachtypus) suggests, the term stands for the idea of a\nprototype of language, similar in concept to Goethe’s idea of a\nprotoplant (Urpflanze) which was not to be confused with a\nreal plant but instead embodied the essential features found in all\nexisting plants. But whereas Goethe’s Urpflanze was something\nquasi-real that could be perceived through one’s mental eyes, Goethe\nclaimed, Humboldt’s type is of a different\n nature[5]\n Since linguistic form is not something material or something\nabstracted from natural languages, but pertains to a\nVerrichtung (performance) namely the production of\nspeech, Humboldt’s prototype embodies the ensemble of elements and\nrule systems that must be considered common and essential for speech\nproduction in all languages (Verfahrensweise); in short, it\nis a generative rather than a substantive notion. Once established,\nthrough a combination of philosophical-methodological reflection and\nconcrete linguistic analysis, the linguistic prototype was to serve\nand did serve Humboldt as a guide and tertium comparationis\nfor the study and comparison of different languages and language\ngroups. In short, the prototype is not to be seen as an object, a list\nof specific surface structure features, nor does it resemble any\nexisting actual language, but instead stands for the communality of\nelements, rules, and structures that underlie all language production.\nFor example, the existence of phonetic elements in a given language,\nconstituting a sound system (Lautsystem) and its\nindividual word always combining a sound-unit with a thought-unit,\nmust be understood as part of the prototypal nature of language,\nwhereas the particular Lautsystem of that language as it\nresulted from its historical development becomes the subject of\nspecific linguistic investigations.  \nSimilarly, but on a larger scale, Humboldt thought the investigation\nof individual languages and their specific form and character should\nbe guided by the linguist’s awareness of the prototypal element in\nthem while his work should also contribute to our knowledge of the\nprototype. The task of the linguist was therefore “to study each\nlanguage as a fragment of the universal language of the human\nspecies”, (“comme un fragment du langage\ngénéral du genre humain”) (Essai sur les\nlangues du Nouveau Continent in Stetter 2004: 238). Yet for\nHumboldt languages do not differ from each other as species\n(Gattungen) but as individuals; their character does not\npertain to the species but to them as individuals as conditioned by\nand as a result of their own specific historical development (GS Vol\n6: 150). The comparative study of the world’s languages, as Humboldt\nenvisioned it, thus represented a constant challenge to the empirical\nlinguist and to the philosopher; namely, to discover in the linguistic\ndata that which relates to the prototypal in language and to increase\nour knowledge of the nature of language and the human language\ncapacity. Furthermore, he saw the importance of linguistic studies\n(Sprachstudien) in the discovery of the part language plays\nin the formation and transmission of ideas (Vorstellungen)\nnot just in “the metaphysical sense” as conditioning the\ncreation of concepts, but also in the way in which an individual\nlanguage imparts its formative imprint on these concepts (GS Vol 6:\n147).  \nThere are some critical distinctions that Humboldt employs in his\nlinguistic writings, which shed light on his understanding of language\nand the approach he follows in his empirical investigations. Most\nfamous (and often misunderstood) is his distinction between language\nperceived as product (Werk) or ergon on the one hand\nand as activity (Tätigkeit) or energeia on the\nother (Humboldt 1836: LVII). It is not identical with the distinction\nintroduced by Saussure between langue and parole,\nsince Humboldt’s distinction cuts across both langue and\nparole and both can be seen from the angle of either process\nor product. Because Humboldt perceived language not as a fixed entity\nor object, but as something transitory, something that is real only in\nthe moment of speaking, as an activity, he thought “its true\ndefinition can only be a genetic one” (Humboldt 1836: LVVII).\nThus he distinguished sharply (as did his contemporary Schleiermacher)\nbefore Saussure and twentieth-century linguistics, between language\n(Sprache) and Speech (Rede). In his French\nEssai of 1811 he also uses Saussure’s third term,\nlangage in a similar manner as pertaining to language in a\ngeneral sense.  \nAlthough he developed almost single-handedly against the tenets of his\ntime and of most of the Nineteenth Century a structural approach for\nhis investigation of dozens of mostly non-European languages, Humboldt\ndid not consider the study of a language’s structure, its\nBau, the ultimate end of linguistics. Because language in its\nfullest sense occurs only in the societal context in its acts of\nspeech production and in what is being said through them, its true\nnature can only be intimated and perceived in living discourse\n(verbundener Rede) and should be studied equally in its\nlasting manifestations in the works of culture and of science, in\nliterature, poetry, and philosophy. \nA comprehensive account and just assessment of Humboldt’s achievements\nin philosophy of language and linguistics will become possible only as\nthe new complete edition of his Writings on Linguistics\n(Schriften zur Sprachwissenschaft), presently under way,\nbecomes\n available.[6]","contact.mail":"markus.messling@uni-saarland.de","contact.domain":"uni-saarland.de"}]
