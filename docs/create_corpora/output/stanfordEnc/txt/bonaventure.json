During his\nlifetime he rose to become one of the most prominent men in Latin\nChristianity. His academic career as a theologian was cut short when\nin 1257 he was put in charge of the Order of Friars Minor (O.F.M.). He\nsteered the Franciscans on a moderate and intellectual course that\nmade them the most prominent order in the Catholic Church until the\ncoming of the Jesuits. His theology was marked by an attempt\ncompletely to integrate faith and reason. He thought of Christ as the\n“one true master” who offers humans knowledge that begins\nin faith, is developed through rational understanding, and is\nperfected by mystical union with God.\n\n\n  A master of the memorable phrase, Bonaventure held that philosophy\nopens the mind to at least three different routes humans can take on\ntheir journey to God. Non-intellectual material creatures he conceived\nas shadows and vestiges (literally, footprints) of God, understood as\nthe ultimate cause of a world philosophical reason can prove was\ncreated at a first moment in time. Intellectual creatures he conceived\nof as images and likenesses of God, the workings of the human mind and\nwill leading us to God understood as illuminator of knowledge and\ndonor of grace and virtue. The final route to God is the route of\nbeing, in which Bonaventure brought Anselm’s argument together with\nAristotelian and Neoplatonic metaphysics to view God as the absolutely\nperfect being whose essence entails its existence, an absolutely\nsimple being that causes all other, composite beings to exist. These\nthree routes are outlined in Sections 3, 4, and 5 below.\n\n\n\nOn 2 February 1257, Br. Bonaventure was appointed Minister General\nin charge of the Franciscan\n Order.[1]\n This act of ecclesiastical preferment effectively split his life into\ntwo halves, the burdens of the ecclesiastical administrator replacing\nthe leisure of the scholar. He is thought to have been forty years old\nat the time—the minimum age for a Minister General—giving\nhim a birth date of 1217. \n\nBonaventure was born Giovanni di Fidanza in Bagnoregio in Tuscany.  He\nhimself attests that he was healed miraculously as a child by the\nintervention of Francis of Assisi, shortly after the saint’s death on\n3 October\n 1226[2]:\n “when I was a boy, as I still vividly remember, I was snatched\nfrom the jaws of death by his invocation and merits.” He did not\nrush to join the Franciscans, but matriculated as a layman in the Arts\nfaculty at the University of Paris in 1235 and proceeded all the way\nto the Master of Arts, around 1243.  The Arts curriculum at Paris then\nconsisted of the seven liberal arts, supplemented by some works of\nAristotle. Heavily weighted in favor of the trivium—the\nlinguistic arts of grammar, rhetoric, and logic—teaching in the\nquadrivium—the four mathematical and scientific\ndisciplines—was somewhat limited, partially due to the\nprohibition of Aristotle’s works in natural philosophy at Paris in\n1210. Though some Masters of Arts, such as Roger Bacon and Richard\nRufus, were teaching the Aristotelian natural philosophy, the\nrequirements for becoming a Master of Arts as late as 1252 listed only\nthe old logic, new logic, and the On the Soul (De\nanima) among Aristotle’s works; the earliest record of\nAristotle’s entire natural philosophy and metaphysics as required for\ngraduation only appears in\n 1255,[3]\n two years before Bonaventure left the University. His writing\nreflects this education; a master of logic and rhetoric, he was less\ndeeply read in the Aristotelian and Islamic philosophical texts than\nhis Dominican contemporaries, Albert and Thomas. \n\nAbout the time young Giovanni began to study Arts, Alexander of Hales,\nMaster of Theology and initiator of the practice of commenting on the\nSentences of Peter Lombard, took the Franciscan habit. His conversion\ngave the Franciscans a Chair in Theology, the Dominicans having\nacquired two Chairs during the university strike of 1229–30.  Hales\nheld him in the highest regard and said that “in him Adam seemed\nnot to have sinned” (Salimbene 1905–1912, 664).  Giovanni took\nthe Franciscan habit in 1243/4, using the name\n“Bonaventure” to celebrate his “good-fortune”\nunder Francis and Hales. \n\nBonaventure attended lectures and disputations in theology from 1243\nto 1248. Writing about 1280, the Franciscan chronicler Salimbene said:\n“Br. John of Parma [Franciscan Minister General] gave the\nlicense to Br. Bonaventure of Bagnoregio to read at Paris, which he\nhad never yet done because he was not yet installed in a Chair. He\nthen read the whole Gospel of St. Luke, a commentary that is very\nbeautiful and complete. This was in\n 1248.”[4]\n This entry refers to Bonaventure’s cursorie lectures as\n“Bachelor of the Bible,” 1248–1250. From 1250–2 he\ncommented on the Sentences (Sententiae in IV Libris\nDistinctae). Once Master, he revised the Commentary\n(Commentaria in Quatuor Libros Sententiarum), his major\nphilosophical and theological work. In 1252–3 he was a “formed\nBachelor” of Theology, performing the three duties of a Master:\nlecturing on the Bible, engaging in disputations, and preaching. In\n1253 the Masters and students of the University of Paris went on\nstrike, all but the friars.  The two Dominicans and William of\nMeliton, O.F.M., continued to teach and refused to take an oath of\nloyalty to the University corporation, for which they were expelled\nfrom the “university of masters,” an action defended by\nthe University in a letter of 4\n February.[5]\n Bonaventure received the licentia docendi by Easter 1254, in\nthe midst of this conflict. He assumed the Franciscan Chair in\ntheology immediately, but taught only at the Franciscan convent,\nunrecognized by the University. \n\nBonaventure performed all three tasks of a Master of Theology from\n1254–57. He revised his commentary on Luke and composed commentaries\non John and Ecclesiastes. He also held three sets of disputed\nquestions. The questions On the Knowledge of Christ (De\nscientia Christi), which develop his illumination theory of\nknowledge, probably came out of his inception as Master in 1254. The\nquestions On the Mystery of the Trinity (De mysterio\nTrinitatis), which elaborated his view of God, were likely the\nlast ones he wrote (Hayes 1992, 40–44; 1979, 24–29).  Both were\ncomposed in a lofty style that gives no evidence of the conflict\nembroiling Paris at the time. The third set of disputed questions,\nhowever, were On Evangelical Perfection (De perfectione\nevangelica) and consisted in a defense of the friars’ way of\nlife, under attack by non-mendicant Masters led by William of\nSt. Amour. In October 1256, Pope Alexander IV ordered the secular\nMasters at Paris to accept Bonaventure and the Dominican Thomas of\nAquino in their rightful places as Masters of Theology, but it was not\nuntil 12 August 1257 that they did so. But six months earlier\nBonaventure had been appointed Minister\n General.[6]\n In addition to the normal magisterial writings, Bonaventure also\nwrote On Retracing the Arts to Theology (Opusculum de\nreductione artium ad theologiam) while Master; and probably in\n1257, while leaving the University, he managed to compose his\nBreviloquium, a “short reading” that contains in\noutline the main theses of a theological summa that would never be\ncomposed.  \n\nFrom this point on, Bonaventure’s writing reflected the needs of the\nOrder, but he did not cast aside his philosophical mind.  Bonaventure\nquickly set a firm direction for the Order in an “encyclical\nletter” to all the friars on 23 April 1257, which admonished\nthem to recover the “somewhat tarnished” luster of the\nOrder. The Minister General followed with three tracts written in\n1259–60 for the spiritual edification of the friars: A Soliloquy\nabout Four Mental Exercises (Soliloquium de quatuor\nmentalibus exercitiis), The Tree of Life (Lignum\nvitae), and The Triple Way (De Triplici\nvia). \n\nBonaventure’s most influential work over the centuries was composed at\nthis time. For Francis’s feast day in October, 1259, Bonaventure\nvisited Mt. Alverna, the very place where Francis himself had received\na mystical vision of Christ “under the appearance” of\n“a Seraph having six wings” and had had “imprinted\nin his flesh” the stigmata or wounds of\n Christ[7]\n Here Bonaventure conceived the idea for his Journey of the Mind\nto God (Itinerarium mentis in Deum), a mental and\nspiritual journey to God whose basic outline—though not its\ndetails—could be understood by even the simplest friar. The\njourney follows the route first charted by St.  Augustine—from\nthe exterior world to the interior mind, and from the interior but\ninferior human mind to the superior mind, namely, to God. Bonaventure\nallegorically understood the six wings of the angelic Seraph Francis\nsaw to stand for six ways God can be approached and therefore arranged\nhis Journey into seven chapters. The two lower wings of the\nSeraph symbolize seeing God through “footprints\n(vestigia),” signs in the sub-human world that point to\nGod, including signs in the physical universe itself (c. 1) and signs\nfound in the sensory life humans have in common with other animals\n(c. 2). The two middle wings of the Seraph symbolize seeing God in his\n“image,” namely, in humans understood as bearing within\ntheir intellectual nature special signs pointing to God.  Here\nBonaventure distinguished signs of God found in the\n“natural” exercise of the mind in theoretical knowledge\n(c.  3) from those found in its exercise in the practical sphere\n“reformed by grace” (c. 4). The two highest wings of the\nSeraph symbolize seeing God in himself, first in the way reason sees\nGod as having one divine nature (c. 5) and then as faith sees God in\nthe Trinity of persons (c. 6). These three sets of twin\n“steps” culminate in the “mental and mystical\ntransport” found in mystical experience (c. 7), the end of the\nJourney. For each step, Bonaventure used material from\nearlier writings; but the Journey, like all his later works,\nis only a sketch the Minister General knew he would never have the\nleisure to complete. The result is his writing achieves a combination\nof scriptural imagery, philosophic depth, mystical yearning, and\ndensity more meditative than demonstrative. But the Journey\ndoes provide an appropriate outline for looking at Bonaventure’s\nphilosophy. After considering his views on the relation of philosophy,\nfaith, and theology (Section 2), we shall look respectively at\nBonaventure’s views on physical creation (Section 3), human nature and\ncognition (Section 4), and on God (Section 5). \n\nThe General Chapter of 1260 held in Narbonne, France, the first where\nBonaventure presided, ratified his codification of the legal statutes\nunder which Franciscans lived, known as the “Constitutions of\nNarbonne” and also asked him to write a definitive Life of\nSt. Francis, which he did in 1261. These two works set the Order\non a moderate course that lasted for centuries and led Franciscans to\ncall Bonaventure their “second founder.” \n\nFor most of the period from 1257 through 1266 Bonaventure trekked\nthrough France and Italy by foot, as did all friars when they\ntraveled.  In 1266 he returned to Paris, where his friars were under\nattack both from conservatives in the Theology faculty and from\nradicals in Arts.  Bonaventure began a series of writings devoted\nprimarily to moral matters: Collations on the Ten\nCommandments (Collationes de decem praeceptis), Lent of\n1267; Collations on the Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit\n(Collationes de septem donis Spiritus sancti), Lent of 1268;\na defense of the friars bearing the Socratic title Apologia\npauperum (Defense of the Mendicants), 1269. On 10\nDecember 1270, Etienne Tempier, bishop of Paris, condemned certain\nerroneous Aristotelian propositions. During Easter-tide of 1273\nBonaventure delivered his magisterial Collations on the\nHexameron (Collationes in Hexaemeron). \n\nThe last period of Bonaventure’s life saw him rise to become one of\nthe most prominent men in Christendom. During the three year Papal\nvacancy, from 29 November 1268 to 1 September 1271, Bonaventure\npreached an important sermon in Viterbo and was probably instrumental\nin the invention of conclave. He is said to have been offered the\npapacy by the electors and to have suggested Teobaldi Visconti\ninstead.  After Teobaldi’s election as Pope Gregory X, he appointed\nBonaventure cardinal on 28 May\n 1273,[8]\n where he preached on reunification of eastern and western Churches, a\nmajor goal of the council which seemed to have been achieved when he\nsuddenly fell ill on 15 July 1274 and “at the hour of Matins\ndied Br. Bonaventure of happy memory, Bishop of Albano, who was a man\neminent for his knowledge and eloquence (homo eminentis scientie\net eloquentie), a man outstanding for his sanctity and\nacknowledged for the excellence of his life, both religious and\nmoral…Br. Peter of Tarantasia [also a Cardinal] celebrated the\nfuneral mass and preached on the theme ‘I am saddened over you,\nmy brother Jonathan.’ There were many tears and much weeping,\nfor the Lord had given him such grace that the hearts of all who saw\nhim were seized with a desire for his\n love.”[9] \n\nWithout exception, every word of philosophy Bonaventure ever wrote is\ncontained in works explicitly religious—in sermons, works of\nspiritual direction, and theology. He never wrote the kind of\nintroductions to the principles of metaphysics and natural philosophy\nthat Thomas Aquinas composed in his On Being and Essence\n(De ente et essentia) and On the Principles of\nNature (De principiis naturae), nor did he comment on\nAristotle’s works. Commentators writing during the twentieth century\nneo-thomistic revival compared Bonaventure with three other thinkers:\nAristotle, Augustine, and Aquinas. P. Mandonnet thought he had no\nphilosophy of his own, but was an Augustinian theologian, pure and\nsimple, all of whose conclusions depend on faith. E. Gilson thought\nBonaventure developed an Augustinian philosophy within his theology:\n“with St. Bonaventure the mystical synthesis of mediaeval\nAugustinianism was fully formed, just as that of Christian\nAristotelianism was fully formed with St. Thomas.” F. Van\nSteenberghen thought his philosophy a failed Aristotelianism separate\nfrom but at the service of his Augustinian\n theology.[10]\n None of these interpretations quite captures Bonaventure’s relation\nto these three philosophers or his own approach to the relations among\nreason, faith, and theology, because they implicitly employed a\nThomistic model for being an Aristotelian, with the result that\nBonaventure’s failures derive from his not being the kind of\nAristotelian Thomas Aquinas was. \n\nBonaventure’s approach to Aristotle was quite different from Albert\nand Thomas. He felt no need for detailed knowledge of the text of\nAristotle. As a student in Arts he had learned from his Masters, not\nfrom detailed study of Aristotle’s text, broadly Aristotelian\nphilosophical principles—the categories and transcendentals, the\ncauses and predicables, and fundamental notions like potency and act,\npossible and necessary—sufficient to do his own work. As a\nphilosopher and theologian, he was perfectly capable of using such\nborrowed principles to draw his own conclusions, ones which he himself\nsaid depended more on Alexander of Hales than on any philosopher:\n“For I do not intend to advocate new opinions, but to reweave\nthe common and approved ones.” Consequently, Bonaventure was not\na failed Aristotelian for the simple reason that he never tried to be\nan Aristotelian in the Dominican way at all. On the other hand, while\nAugustine was clearly Bonaventure’s favorite theological authority, he\nwas not, properly speaking, an Augustinian. Even when he draws\nAugustinian conclusions, Bonaventure does not employ Augustinian\narguments. In truth, Bonaventure was, broadly speaking, an\nAristotelian in his philosophical principles, but not in his\nconclusions. A better way to describe his philosophical conclusions\nand his way of drawing them is that his thought was\nFranciscan in inspiration and Bonaventurean in\nexecution. \n\nThe pressing issue concerning philosophy, faith, and theology in the\n1250s was how to set up theology as an Aristotelian demonstrative\nscience. Albert had done so in his commentary on the\nSentences (1243–9), which Bonaventure had on hand when\nwriting his own commentary. Demonstration is causal knowledge, and a\nscience in Aristotle’s sense is systematic knowledge of one limited\nsubject developed through demonstrating necessary conclusions by\nmaking use of certain fundamental causal principles relevant to the\nsubject at hand.  The task theology had set itself, then, was to\ndiscover and present systematically the truths set out in that most\nunsystematic of books—the Bible. \n\nSince a “science” is causal knowledge, Bonaventure devoted\nthe four questions of the prologue to his commentary on Book 1 of the\nSentences, which serves as his introduction the whole\n“science” of theology, to its four causes—efficient,\nfinal, formal, and material. These causes in turn clarify the\nrelations between philosophy, faith, and theology. \n\nSince science exists as an intellectual habit in the mind of the\nknower, the efficient cause of any book of theology is the\nauthor who wrote it, Peter Lombard in the case of his\nSentences, Bonaventure himself in the case of his commentary.\nLombard was no mere scribe, compiler, or commentator; he was an\n“author,” and the same is true of Bonaventure\nhimself. This simple point distinguishes faith, whose sole efficient\ncause is God working through grace, from both philosophy and theology,\nwhose efficient cause is the human mind, though even here God has a\nrole to play. \n\nWhen he came to clarify the end of theology, Bonaventure\nunderstood that Aristotle had sharply distinguished practical\nscience—whose end is deeds—from theoretical\nscience—whose end is knowledge. So he asks whether theology is\n“for the sake of contemplation or for the sake of our becoming\ngood.” The answer is that theology is more perfect than any\nphilosophical science because it breaks through the bounds of this\nAristotelian dichotomy. Neither theoretical knowledge nor practical\ndeeds get to the center of the moral life, which is love—both\nthe “affection” of love and the theological virtue of\ncharity.  The kind of intellectual virtue that prepares the mind for\ncharity is a “wisdom” that “involves knowledge and\naffection together.” The “knowledge that Christ died for\nus,” for example, is far different from the knowledge of the\ngeometer or the knowledge of the general. Consequently, theological\nwisdom is both “for the sake of contemplation and also for our\nbecoming good, but principally for the sake of our becoming\ngood” through enlivening our knowledge and deeds with Christian\n“affection”. \n\nThe form that produces “science” is its\n“method of proceeding.” Now “the end imposes\nnecessity on the means, since ‘teeth are sharp in order to\ncut,’ as Aristotle says.” Since theology is\n“designed to promote the faith,” it employs “the\nmethod of argumentation or inquiry” first developed by\nAristotle. By adapting the philosophical method to the data of faith,\ntheology attempts to “confound the adversaries of the\nfaith,” “strengthen those weak in their faith,” and\n“delight those whose faith is complete.” Bonaventure\nsituated theology within the hierarchy of the sciences by adverting to\nAristotle’s notion of “subalternated sciences.” The\nPhilosopher had recognized that optics—which studies visible\nlines—is a science “subalternated” to\ngeometry—which studies lines as such. Theology depends upon\nScripture in a similar way, for scripture offers certain truths to be\nbelieved, but theology looks at the same truths “as made\nintelligible.” In this way, theology is different from the faith\nit tries to understand and from the Scripture that offers faith to\n us.[11] \n\nTo understand theology as a “science” making faith\nintelligible, Bonaventure must clarify its material cause.\nDetermining that material cause of theology is the same as\nsettling on its subject. On this point, there had been\nconsiderable dispute among the Masters. Aristotle’s\n“sciences” were all limited to a particular genus, such as\n“animal” or “soul” or “memory” or\n“ethics.” Even his universal science of metaphysics was\nlimited to studying substances; it eschewed the other categories.\nTheology, by contrast, cuts across all genera and includes God, who is\nnot confined within any genus. Bonaventure was familiar with many\naccounts of the subject of theology: “things and signs,”\nthe work of “reparation for sin,” “Christ—head\nand members,” “God,” and “the object of\nbelief” (credibile). To throw light on these conflicting\nanswers, Bonaventure turned to his study of the Arts. Priscian had\nnoted three different senses of the subject of grammar. Its subject in\nthe sense of its “root principle” is the\n“letter” that makes up words; its subject conceived as an\n“integral whole” is “a fitting and complete\noration;” and its subject conceived as “universal\nwhole” is “meaningful sound, articulated and\nordered.” There are three correlative senses of the subject of\ntheology: “God” is the “principle” of the\nsubject and “Christ—head and members” is the\n“integral whole,” the entirety of what theology\nstudies. But the most important sense of “subject” is the\n“universal whole.” Therefore, “the subject of this\nbook, properly speaking,” is the “object of belief,”\na subject that lets theology range over all realities and all thoughts\nabout which one can have religious faith. \n\nBonaventure does not explicitly address the principles of theology.\nBut he further clarifies its “subject” in a way that\npoints to those principles. To faith, Scripture adds the notion of\n“authority,” and to the faith and authority of Scriptural\nrevelation, theology adds “proof.” Theology presupposes\nfaith but adds to it rational demonstrations about matters of faith.\nConsequently, Bonaventure adds a telling qualification to his\ndescription of the subject of theology. Theology’s subject is the\nobject of belief “in so far as the believable is transformed\ninto the notion of the intelligible, and this happens by the addition\nof\n reasoning.”[12]\n With this concise formula, Bonaventure includes within theology both\nreligious belief transformed by arguments from natural reason and\nnatural reason transformed by arguments based on religious\nrevelation. If so, then theology must have the kinds of principles\nthat make possible both kinds of arguments: the fundamental truths of\nfaith drawn from the Bible and tradition, but also fundamental truths\nof reason. What makes all such basic truths theological is their\nargumentative function. Theological arguments may draw from revelation\nby using revealed truths as premises and they may draw from reason by\nusing rational truths as premises. Both kinds of arguments are\ntheological because of the use to which they are put. In this way,\nphilosophical reasoning has an integral place within the\ndomain of Bonaventurean theology. \n\nBonaventure showed how philosophical reasoning works in theology in\nthe very structure of his disputed question On the Mystery of the\nTrinity. Each question is divided into two articles, the first\nproven using rational premises and the second proven using premises\ndrawn from faith. In Question 1, for example, God is rationally proven\nto exist in Art. 1, then shown to be a trinity of persons using\narguments based on faith and reason in Art. 2. Theology, then,\nconsists most fundamentally in the understanding that results from\njoining rational arguments and faith-based arguments\n together.[13]\n The same mode of reasoning is found in On Reducing the Arts to\nTheology. Here “reduction” consists in developing\nanalogies that move the mind from the liberal arts to theology and\nback again. Bonaventure argues for each point by combining one claim\nbased on reason with another based on revelation, as though they were\nwall and buttress of the cathedral of theology. Philosophical\nreasoning, then, is an absolutely integral part of Bonaventure’s\nfaith-based theology. \n\nIn the first step of the Journey Bonaventure focuses upon the\nsensible objects of the physical world around us, both taken in\nthemselves and in reference to our sense awareness of them. Like all\ncreatures, sensible things are understood to be signs that ultimately\ncan direct humans to the divine art or wisdom through which all things\nhave been made. Bonaventure’s semiotics distinguishes four sorts of\nsigns. All creatures can be seen as “shadows”\n(umbra) and “vestiges” (lit. footprints,\nvestigia): “For a creature is called a shadow based on\nits properties which point to God in some type of causality in an\nindeterminate way. But a creature is called a vestige based on\nproperties which point to God as triple cause–efficient, formal,\nand final cause; for example, the properties: one, true, and\n good.”[14] \n In addition, Bonaventure posits two higher types of semiosis\npertinent solely to rational creatures, which are “images”\n(imago) pointing to the First Principle through its properly\nrational powers which have their source and highest object in God and\n“likenesses” (similitudo) of God to the extent\nthat they are recipients of divine grace and conform themselves to the\ndivine will. All creatures, from rocks to angels, are signs in the\nsense of shadows and traces of God, for they all bear a relation of\ncausal dependency upon God as their source; but only rational\ncreatures can have the divine as an object of their activities and,\nfor that reason, can conform themselves to the divine will and become\nlikenesses of God. \n\nBonaventure’s understanding of the physical world is heavily indebted\nto two fundamental sources: the Biblical account of creation, mediated\nby Patristic commentaries, and the Aristotelian view of nature, taken\nchiefly from Aristotle’s writings on natural philosophy, such as the\nPhysics (Physica) and On the Heavens\n(De caelo), but combined with the commentaries of Averroes,\nthe tracts of Avicenna, and the Timaeus of Plato in the Latin\ntranslation of Chalcidius. Bonaventure constructs a view of the\nphysical world that is indebted to both of his fundamental sources,\nbut ultimately gives the Scriptural text and the related Patristic\ntradition precedence whenever his sources come into conflict. His\nmanner of synthesizing those sources into a coherent and impressive\nwhole is what gives his views on nature their distinctive\ncharacter. \n\nThe tension between the newly translated Aristotelian corpus and the\ntraditional theological teaching of the Church regarding the doctrine\nof creation was well understood by Bonaventure’s time. Indeed, the\nprohibitions of 1215 and 1231 regarding the teaching of the\nAristotelian writings on natural philosophy had given way to the\ndirect teaching of Aristotle in the Faculty of Arts by the time\nBonaventure took his master of arts degree at the University of Paris,\nand by the time he left the University, the Aristotelian corpus in its\nentirety was a subject of examination for candidates for degrees in\nthe Faculty of Arts. Yet the Aristotelian doctrine of the eternity of\nthe world was given various interpretations. Some favored a benign\ninterpretation, claiming that all Aristotle meant in Physics\nVIII was that the world and its motion did not arise from some earlier\nmotion, but rather time, moveable things, and motion were all coeval\nand\n concomitant.[15]\n Others, however, chief among them Robert Grosseteste, argued that the\nviews of Aristotle should be taken at face value and what the\nStagirite intended was the eternity of the past; the Greek Fathers and\nAristotle’s own commentators both were in accord that the Aristotelian\noutlook involved the beginninglessness of the past and unoriginated\n matter.[16] \n\nBonaventure’s own position takes its origins from a combination of\nelements coming from Alexander of Hales and Grosseteste.  Following\nthe lead of the latter, Bonaventure rejects, albeit with some\nhesitation, the benign reading of the Stagirite; in all likelihood,\nAristotle did intend to teach that the world was beginningless: \n\nYet the most striking feature of Bonaventure’s account of the\nphilosophers is the manner in which he juxtaposes the doctrine of\ncreation, as he understands it, with the philosophical theory of\norigins. According to Bonaventure, only two theories regarding the\norigin of the cosmos are really tenable: first, the theory of the\npagan philosophers according to which the world is eternal and the\nmatter of the universe is without ultimate causal origin; second, the\nChristian doctrine of creation according to which the universe depends\nentirely for its being on God, is produced “from nothing (ex\nnihilo),” and is temporally finite in the past. The third\npossibility, namely that the world is both produced from nothing and\neternal, Bonaventure vehemently rejects on the grounds that such a\nposition is inherently contradictory: \n\nReturning to the last argument, we find the reasoning to which\nBonaventure refers. The argument is an elegant synthesis and\nrestatement of the position of Parisian theologians since the time of\nWilliam of Auxerre, but is especially indebted to the\nQuaestiones of Alexander of Hales. Everything that depends\nentirely for its being on something else is produced by that thing\nfrom nothing. The world depends entirely for its being on God. Hence,\nthe world must be produced from nothing. If the world is produced from\nnothing, it must either arise out of the “nothing” as out\nof matter or out of the “nothing” as out of a point of\norigin. The world cannot arise out of nothing as out of matter. Thus\nthe world must arise out of nothing as out of a point of origin. If,\nhowever, the world arises out of nothing as out of a point of origin,\nthen the world has being after non-being. Nothing having being after\nnon-being can be eternal. The world, as a created thing, has being\nafter non-being. Therefore, the world, precisely as created “out\nof nothing,” cannot be\n eternal.[19]\n The philosophical force of the expression that there be a logical\nmoment at which we could say that the world is not and with reference\nto which the world begins to be. The ontological reference of such a\nlogical moment is the divine eternity with respect to which\n(‘after’ which) the world begins. \n\nTo Bonaventure’s mind, the creationist view of the universe alone\naccounts for the total being of the universe in the sense of\nexplaining both its structure and the fact that it exists; the view of\nthe ancients only explains the order and the pattern of the universe\nwithout reaching the depths of accounting for why the universe exists\nat all. A sign of this shortcoming is to be seen in the shared\npresupposition of Plato and Aristotle that matter is unoriginated.\nFurthermore, to the extent that the ancient pagan views of the\nuniverse involve the infinity of past time, with all the philosophical\ndifficulties that the eternity of past time entails, natural reason\nwould seem capable of arriving, in principle, at the conclusion that\nthe world was created, even though, historically speaking, the\ngreatest of the ancient philosophers failed to do so. \n\nThe conflict between Scriptural sources and the Aristotelian writings\non the issue of the primordial state of matter is not so severe,\nbecause in the Aristotelian corpus there is no description of the\nprimordial state of matter, and the other sources available to\nBonaventure are themselves in disagreement. Augustine, for example,\nhad suggested in his literal commentary on Genesis that the matter of\nthe world could have been made all at once, whereas in his\nConfessions (Confessiones) he had suggested that\nthere might be an indeterminate and inchoate initial state of\nmatter. This possibiliity was further corroborated by such pagan\nauthors as Plato and Ovid, who had posited a primordial chaotic state\nof matter out of which the present cosmic order gradually emerged\n(Plato, Timaeus 52D-53C, 54–55; Ovid, Metamorphoses,\n43:5–45:7). \n\nBonaventure begins by distinguishing the consideration of matter from\nthe actual existence of matter in the order of natural\n history.[20]\n We may consider matter simply as a constitutive principle of things\nand as such it is pure potency; this is the way that the concept of\nmatter functions in Aristotle’s Physics and, to Bonaventure’s\nmind, how Augustine spoke of matter in the Confessions. But\nwe may also think of matter as it actually exists in time. In this\nrespect, matter never exists and cannot exist as lacking all\nform. Such a claim, however, does not require that material creation\nwas brought forth as fully formed, even if such a position might be\nmore philosophically defensible than its\n opposite.[21]\n Instead, Bonaventure suggests that physical matter was created in a\nstate wherein it had a tendency and capacity to admit many different\nforms, though it had none of them in its own right. Rather, its\npotentiality to develop distinct forms required further external,\ndivine agency in order for the distinct things having diverse forms to\nfully\n emerge.[22]\n Physical matter’s properties in its incomplete state included\nextension and visibility (properties arising from the form common to\nall physical things, namely, light). These features are still shared\nby all the items in the physical world, even though Bonaventure\nadmits, in accord with the Aristotelian teaching on the heavens, that\nheavenly bodies, such as the stars, have matter that differs in kind\nfrom that of terrestrial things. Accordingly, after things were fully\nproduced matter was twofold, terrestrial and celestial, but in its\nprimordial state physical matter enjoyed a corresponding unity that\nwas one of contiguity, i.e., it was one\n mass.[23]\n This primordial unity of physical matter continues to have some\nscientific bearing for Bonaventure since it grounds the consideration\nof the general physicist who may prescind from the process of\ngeneration and corruption and consider bodies simply in terms of their\nmobility in place and\n extension.[24] \n\nBonaventure’s treatment of light is mainly found in the discussion of\nlight in his commentary on Lombard’s Sentences, Bk. 2, d.\n13. In this theological context, light mainly bears upon the work of\nthe six days of creation, and Bonventure must take a position on the\nGenesis account of the creation of light. Though he acknowledges\nAugustine’s spiritualizing interpretation of light, an interpretation\nthat identifies the light spoken of in Genesis with the creation and\nactivities of the angels, Bonaventure inclines to a more literal\n interpretation.[25]\n This means that Bonaventure had to take a position on the\ncontemporary debates on light and its nature. \n\nThe two positions that Bonaventure discusses are what we may call a\nbroadly Aristotelian position, one eventually adopted by Thomas\nAquinas, and a broadly Augustinian position advocated by Robert\nGrosseteste in his On light (De luce). According to\nthe first, light is simply an accidental form, one found in degrees in\ndifferent bodies, but according to the second, light is perhaps a\nsubstance or at least a substantial form communicating extension and\nvisibility to physical things. \n\nBonaventure discounts the possibility that light is a substance,\nbecause it is purely active and if it were a substance in its own\nright it would be God and not a creature. He does allow, however, that\nlight is a substantial form and is the substantial form that is\nconcomitant with the mass of matter in its primordial\n state.[26]\n In this originating condition, light gave the mass of matter its\nextension and visibility and the hierarchy of heavenly bodies\ncorresponds to the hierarchy of things capable of partaking either\nmore or less in the light that renders bodies active and extended. For\nBonaventure, then, light is a substantial form, but only the partial\nperfection of any given physical substance, whether celestial or\nterrestrial. Since Bonaventure endorses, usually without any elaborate\nargumentation, the general claim that there is a plurality of\nsubstantial forms within any composite thing, his doctrine of light\nreally means that light is the first form, endowing each thing with\nextension, and preparing the way for further perfections such as the\nforms of the elements or the forms of mixtures or compounds. \n\nThe transition in the order of natural history from bodies that are\nsimply such, extended and endowed with the ability to act and be acted\nupon, to the bodies of plants and animals is explained in part through\nthe motions of the celestial bodies and their causal influences on\nmatter. In part, however, matter itself has latent structures that\nsimply await the correct circumstances and conditions to cause the\nemergence of a higher type of body. These latent structures,\noriginally sown into matter at its creation, Bonaventure calls,\nfollowing the terminology of St. Augustine, rationes\nseminales or seminal reasons, a term hearkening back to the\ncosmology of the ancient Stoics.  Seminal reasons amount to a\nlingering impact of the creator on the matter of the physical world\nsince their presence in matter originates with creation. In physical\nscience, Bonaventure believes seminal reasons help to explain the\nsuccessive emergence of the different kinds of bodies suitable for\nhigher and higher types of life. But this process of gradual emergence\ndoes not apply to the creation of human life, since human souls for\nBonaventure are incorruptible and can only arise through the direct\naction of the creator. \n\nThough from our post-Darwinian perspective we may be tempted to see in\nthe doctrine of seminal reasons, whether in Augustine or Bonaventure,\na curious, yet awkward anticipation of the doctrine of evolution,\nsimilarities between the doctrine of seminal reasons and certain\nelements in evolutionary theory are more apparent than real.  First,\nthough seminal reasons do provide directionality and progression for\nthe succession of physical types in natural history, they are\nthemselves latent forms within matter and not reducible to more\nfundamental mechanical or chemical processes; rather, they underlie\nsuch processes. Second, seminal reasons are never appealed to in order\nto explain the demise of one living species and the emergence of\nanother species to replace the former, a key feature of Darwinian\nexplanations. Third, seminal reasons are not, as we have just seen,\nuniversal in their application to the living things that occur within\nthe order of natural history; human beings, at least in terms of their\nsouls, fall outside the range of influence of seminal reasons. \n\nBonaventure’s doctrines regarding living things are mainly inspired by\nan Aristotelian biology. Living things are such thanks to the kind of\nforms they have, namely, soul, which is defined as the first actuality\nof a body having life potentially. Soul is understood as the form that\nmakes a thing alive and able to enjoy the type of life that it\ndoes. Consequently, souls are termed either vegetative, sensitive, or\nrational, according to the functions that the living things themselves\nexercise. \n\nThe world as it is revealed to us through the senses provides the\nmeans for our re-entering ourselves and ascending to higher things.\nFurthermore, the senses themselves are equally signs of higher\nthings. \n\nPhysical things considered in their own right evidence “weight,\nnumber, and measure” (Psalm 83:8), thereby causing us to\ncontemplate their own measure, beauty, and order. These features are\ngrounded in the activities and natural powers of sensible\nsubstances. The nature of sensible substances accordingly expresses in\ntheir actions and interactions the measure, beauty, and order of their\norigin and thereby attest to the power, wisdom, and goodness of the\nSource from which they\n spring.[27]\n Likewise, the origin, size, number, beauty, fullness, function, and\norigin of physical things point to the Divine Source and its essential\nproperties of power, wisdom, and\n goodness.[28] \n\nThe pointing of physical things towards their Source finds its\nparallel in sense cognition itself, which also points towards that\nsame Source. Drawing his point of departure from the Neoplatonic theme\nof macrocosm and microcosm, Bonaventure discovers an analogy between\nAristotelian cosmology and the process of sensation. Each sensible\nobject generates a likeness of itself in the medium through which it\nis perceived, and that likeness in turn generates another likeness\nsuccessively in the sense organ, causing the sense power to apprehend\nthe sensible object. The process so described reflects the process of\nthe emanation of forms from the heavenly bodies and also the manner in\nwhich creatures, going forth from their Principle, return to their\nSource through the exercise of their natural activities. A similar\npattern emerges within the different acts exercised by each sense\npower: the sense apprehends (apprehensio) the object,\ndelights (delectatio) in its object, provided that the object\ndoes not exceed the natural limits of the organ, and judges\n(diiudicatio) or discriminates the quality of its\nobject. This last act, found in both the external senses and the\ninternal senses, takes on a special role for Bonaventure. Such a sense\njudgement, through comparative awareness, detaches the object from a\ngiven place and time, thereby preparing the way within the realm of\nsense cognition for intellectual\n cognition.[29] \n\nWhen we arrive at the threshold of intellectual cognition, we are\nentering the next step along the Bonaventurian journey. This level of\ncreaturely being points to the Divine Source, but in ways that are\nmore direct than those in which sensible creatures do. In exercising\ntheir powers of intellect and will, intellectual creatures discover\nthe highest and most perfect object of their powers in the Divine\nSource of their being, since God is the First or Highest Truth and the\nFirst or Chief Good. Accordingly, intellectual creatures have God as\ntheir ultimate object, whereas all creatures have God as their Cause.\nConsequently, intellectual creatures show themselves to be\n“images” and “likenesses” of God, while they\nshow that all creatures are “shadows” and\n“vestiges” of God. \n\nBonaventure traces out how intellectual creatures and intelligible\nobjects reflect the divine Source. If we begin with something as\nimmediate and basic as simple apprehension on the part of the human\nintellect, we find that an object of simple apprehension (such as the\nnatural kind “dog”) is susceptible of definition. Yet\nevery definition requires a genus and a differentia. Through the\ngeneric term we are led to a further object of simple apprehension,\nusually itself susceptible of definition. If the genus is definable,\nwe may state its definition, but we shall eventually find ourselves\nthrough continuing the process of definition arriving similarly at one\nof the supreme general or Aristotelian categories; if the genus is not\ndefinable, then we have arrived at one of the Aristotelian\ncategories. Once we arrive at a category, we confront an item not\nsusceptible of further definition, though it admits of description. If\nthe categorical item is an accident, it satisfies the description of\nan accident as ‘being through another;’ if we are dealing\nwith substance, then the item we are considering satisfies the\ndescription of substance as ‘being in itself’. \n\nThe resolution of all our items of simple apprehension into the\nconcept of being is metaphysically and epistemologically crucial:\nmetaphysically, it opens up a route of argumentation that leads to the\nexistence of God; epistemologically, such a resolution means that\nbehind all, even the most determinate and specific, conceptions of\nthings lies a transcendental awareness of being that informs all of\nour knowledge. If we take the concept of substance as being in itself,\nwe cannot come to know a particular substance’s definition without the\nconcept of being presupposed in the background, and in addition we are\nconcomitantly aware of the transcendental properties of being (unity,\ntruth, and goodness) in any such notion. Such co-extensive\ntranscendental properties, however, are only one of the two types of\nproperties that belong to being; the other transcendental properties\n(later called disjunctive properties) prove extremely useful for\nincreasing our metaphysical knowledge. Being may be conceived of as\neither actual or potential, absolute or dependent, prior or posterior,\nimmutable or mutable. Yet to conceive of being as potential,\ndependent, posterior, or mutable requires that we already be\nacquainted with being as actual, independent, prior and immutable. In\nother words, the more perfect of the two disjuncts in any of the\ndisjunctive transcendentals must be an item we acknowledge in our\nawareness of being: \n\nAt one level, this line of argumentation is part of an argument for\nthe existence of God. But, at another level, it is an effort to\ndemarcate the proper object of the human mind as being and to point\nout that, if we reflect upon the notion of being (ens) in\nterms of its actuality (esse) we are inexorably led to the\nconclusion that there is a Perfect\n Being.[31]\n We reach the same kind of conclusion if we reflect, not upon the\nprimary object of the mind, but upon its operations. The certainty of\njudgment requires that we be aware of the impossibility of our being\nmistaken combined with our awareness that the truth that we know\ncannot be otherwise; indeed, the most fundamental truths we know are\nall immutable. But, following Augustine, Bonaventure claims that there\nis no source for immutable truth other than God, since God is the only\nimmutable and unchanging\n Being.[32] \n\nWhat we find when we look within ourselves is that we are pointed\nabove to God, who is the light of the mind, guaranteeing the certainty\nof our judgments. This thesis, usually called by scholars divine\nillumination, was quite ancient by Bonaventure’s time; it was part of\nthe philosophical teaching of Augustine. What makes Bonaventure’s\nversion so philosophically distinctive is that he proposes to\nsynthesize the epistemology of divine illumination with the\nAristotelian account of abstraction. Bonaventure is thoroughly\ncommitted to the integral role played by the agent and possible\nintellects in human intellectual cognition. The agent and possible\nintellects are not separated substances, in the way envisaged by\nAverroes, but properly human faculties essential to the constitution\nof the human soul.\n [33]\n Hence, unlike his contemporaries, who often thought of the human\npossible intellect as being illumined by God functioning as an agent\nintellect, Bonaventure assigns each human being an agent\nintellect. Differing from other of his contemporaries, Bonaventure\nalso insists that the possible intellect always remains the recipient\nof the intelligible species abstracted by the agent intellect and the\nfaculty of apprehension; accordingly, the possible intellect continues\nto be part of the human soul even when the soul is separated by death\nfrom the\n body.[34]\n Abstraction is, for Bonaventure, the source of our concepts of\nthings. How then does illumination work and why is it necessary? The\ndivine light works together with the human intellectual faculties as a\n“regulative and moving cause,” ensuring that the human\nmind grasps the immutable truth of the creature; it does not and\ncannot replace the human intellectual faculties in their proper\n roles.[35]\n The appeal to divine illumination is justified, primarily if not\nexclusively, for the reason that there is an incommensurability\nbetween our intellectual faculties and the ordinary objects we know as\ncreated and mutable, on the one hand, and the immutable truths we come\nto know. Inasmuch as things cannot give what they do not have, the\nonly source of eternal and immutable truth is God’s Light. \n\nIn general, the activities proper to intellectual creatures point much\nmore directly than merely sensible or sentient creatures to the divine\nSource. Both the objects of the understanding and the will are\nultimately rooted in God as Being and Goodness. This more direct\npointing to God on the part of the intellectual creature is also seen\nin the intellectual creature’s constitution, both psychological and\nontological. The image of God is found in the fundamental\ninterrelatedness of the memory, understanding, and will. Each act of\nmemory calls to mind the past, is aware of the present and anticipates\nthe future; each act of understanding presupposes the memory of first\nprinciples; and each act of will presupposes the act of understanding\nand moves the mind to further acts of memory. This triadic structure\nof the human mind reflects its Source: the Perfect Being that is\nsimultaneously, Highest Unity, Supreme Truth, and Ultimate\n Good.[36]\n Likewise, the ontological constitution of intellectual creatures,\nhumans and angels, moves us along the road to the consideration of\nGod. Each intellectual creature is composed of act and potency,\nmetaphysical principles that Bonaventure understands to be\nco-extensive with matter and\n form.[37]\n Accordingly, even intellectual creatures are composed of form and\n matter.[38]\n For Bonaventure, it is the conjunction of form and matter that\nexplains the individuality of each\n thing.[39]\n But that even the highest creatures are composed of potency and act\nin this fashion entails that they are derived from a Source that is\nnot so composed, but is, instead, pure act and hence pure form. \n\nIn his Collations on the Hexameron Bonaventure read\nGenesis spiritually, distinguishing seven levels of\n“vision” corresponding to the seven days of creation. The\nfirst level is “understanding naturally given” or\nphilosophy, which he divided following the Stoics into logic, ethics,\nand physics, the last further subdivided following Aristotle into\nnatural philosophy, mathematics, and metaphysics. The focus of\nmetaphysics is on causal relations between God and creatures. Here\n“the philosophers—the finest and the ancient\nphilosophers—came to this conclusion: there is a beginning, and\nan end, and an exemplar cause” of the\n universe,[40]\n that is, God is the efficient, final, and formal cause of the\nworld. Since efficient causality connects metaphysics to physics and\nfinal causality connects it with ethics, the “true\nmetaphysician” focuses on exemplar\n causality,[41]\n a kind of formal causality which is the grand theme of Bonaventurean\nmetaphysics. \n\nTo pursue this theme, Bonaventure made use of materials drawn from\nearlier philosophers about three important points: the\ntranscendentals, the three Neoplatonic routes to God, and the\ndifference between scientific principles and conclusions. About the\ntranscendentals, Aristotle made metaphysics the science of\nsubstance. Centuries later, Avicenna transformed it into a science\ntruly universal in scope by insisting that it study the nine\naccidents, as well as substance, and also the attributes that\ntranscend the categories (Avicenna, Metaphysica, 1.5, 8).\nPhilip the Chancellor codified this doctrine into four\ntranscendentals—being, one, true, and good (Aertsen 1996,\n25–70).  Bonaventure opens consideration of God in his Commentary\non the Sentences by noting that the categorical attributes of\nbeing are “its special properties which characterize its\nimperfection,” but the transcendentals are “its\ngeneral conditions which characterize its\n perfection.”[42]\n The transcendentals therefore set the terms for treating God. \n\nWhen he read “the books of the Platonists,” Augustine\nopened up three routes to proving the existence of God, though he\nhimself explored only one. Arguments like Aristotle’s that begin in\nthe world must proceed from effect to cause and have been called\ncosmological arguments, though\naitiological—meaning simply an argument uncovering\ncauses—seems a better description. When Augustine\nturned within his mind he opened up two other routes to God. The\nsecond route also proceeds from effect to cause, but starts within the\nmind and searches out God as the ultimate cause of the mind’s\nknowledge.  This is the illumination argument for\nGod. Augustine’s turn inward also opened up a third route, later given\nby Kant the unhappy name of ontological argument. The fullest\ndevelopment of this neoplatonic approach to God stood ready to be\nrealized, when all three routes, the aitiological, illuminationist,\nand ontological, would be scouted out by one and the same\nphilosophical mind. That mind was not Augustine’s or Anselm’s but\nBonaventure’s. \n\nIf the transcendentals came primarily from Muslim Aristotelians,\nespecially Avicenna, and the three routes to God were opened by\nAugustine, the last set of materials Bonaventure used to construct his\narguments for the existence of God came from Aristotle himself.\n“Science” consists in knowledge of a limited subject\nachieved through demonstrating conclusions about it based on\nun-demonstrated principles. Bonaventure was one of a group of Parisian\ntheologians, including the Dominicans Albert and Thomas, who attempted\nto set up Christian theology as an Aristotelian science. He therefore\napproached the issue of the existence of God with a sharp distinction\nbetween principles and conclusions in mind. The question he asks is\nnot “Does God exist?” but “Is the divine being so\ntrue that it cannot be thought not to be?” This Anselmian\nformulation offers two options: God’s existence is either a principle\nor a demonstrated conclusion. Philosophers are inclined to pick one\nroute to God and reject all others, but Bonaventure had learned from\nFrancis, the poor man of Assisi, that the world is filled with signs\nof God that even the simplest peasant can grasp. Bonaventure’s\nresponse to the problem of the existence of God was therefore most\nunusual. He pursued all three routes to God; and he even ranked them:\nIllumination arguments make us “certain” of God’s\nexistence; aitiological arguments give us “more certain”\nknowledge of God’s existence; while ontological arguments show that\nGod’s existence is “a truth that is most certain in itself, in\nas far as it is the first and most immediate\n truth.”[43]\nLet us look at each of them in turn. \n\nThe transcendental that initially opens up arguments for the existence\nof God is “truth.” Bonaventure bases his illumination\nargument on the epistemological sense of truth, inspired by\nAugustine’s memorable description of his own inward route to God: \n\nIn his Commentary on the Sentences, Bonaventure extracted\nfrom Augustine’s stirring rhetoric the logical core of the\nillumination argument, reducing it to plain and dispassionate\nsyllogisms, as he had learned from his teachers in Arts at Paris: \n\nBonaventure understood that the step from a true proposition to divine\ntruth is a large one, so he advocates a moderate illuminationist\nposition, one that depends on both divine and created causes.\nBonaventure’s Augustinian illumination theory avoids the problems of\nPlatonism, which turns knowing the world into knowing God, and the\nproblems of Muslim illuminationism, which thought a creature could do\nwhat it takes the infinite mind of God to\n accomplish.[45]\n “For certain knowledge, eternal reason is\nnecessarily involved as a regulative and motive cause, however, not as\nthe sole cause or in its full clarity, but along with a created\ncause and as contuited by us ‘in part’ in accord with\nour present state of\n life.”[46] \n\nTo explain the contribution of the “created” causes of\nknowledge, Bonaventure noted that the content of human\nknowledge comes from four kinds of “created” causes: the\npassive intellect within the individual soul as material\ncause, for it receives knowledge; the individual agent intellect as\nefficient cause, for it abstracts the content of knowledge\nfrom sensation; the essence of an individual creature known as\nformal cause, for the creature is “what” we know;\nand epistemological truth as end. These “proper\nprinciples” of knowledge do not involve\n God.[47] \n\nAbove and beyond these “created” causes, knowledge also\nrequires an “eternal” cause. In the mental acts of\nabstracting universals and arguing inductively, the human mind\ngeneralizes well beyond the data of our experience. It is one thing to\nbe able to generalize so, quite another to be sure one has succeeded.\nIntuition into the essence of a creature involves truths that are not\nonly universal, but also necessary and certain. God is acquainted with\nthe full extension of any universal, since the divine idea of any\ntruth consists in knowledge of that truth in absolutely all its\nactual and possible instantiations. The infinite extension of\nGod’s knowledge is what makes divine understanding certain, and this\ncertainty in the divine mind is on loan, so to speak, to the human\nmind. “If full knowledge requires recourse to a truth\nwhich is fully immutable and stable, and to a light which is\ncompletely infallible, it is necessary for this sort of knowledge to\nhave recourse to the heavenly art as to light and truth: a light,\nI say, which gives infallibility to the [created] knower, and\na truth which gives immutability to the [created] object of\n knowledge.”[48]\n Here Bonaventure makes more precise Augustine’s “light”\nand “truth.” They are the two sides of certitude, so it is\nthe certainty, and only the certainty, found in human knowledge that\nrequires divine illumination; all other features of human\nknowledge–abstraction, universality, correspondence–come\nfrom created causes. \n\nThe aitiological argument is “more certain,” because it\nbegins with a real effect outside the mind and therefore better fits\nAristotle’s model of demonstration. But Bonaventure does not follow\nAristotle’s argument from motion, because motion falls under the\ncategories. More promising were neoplatonic aitiological arguments\n(Boethius Consolatio philosophiae III 10; Anselm,\nMonologion 1–3), which combine an empirical premise with a\nparticipation premise. This is how Bonaventure packed his aitiological\nargument into a single syllogism: “Every truth and every created\nnature proves and leads to the existence of the divine truth. For if\nthere is being by participation and from another, there must exist a\nbeing due to its own essence and not from\n another.”[49] \n\nFor his empirical premise Bonaventure turns again to truth,\nbut ontological truth. All creatures are true to the extent that they\nactualize the potential perfections of their natures, and they are\nfalse to the extent that they fail to do so, because ontological truth\nis “the indivision of act and potency.” So “in a\ncreature there is indivision combined with difference between\nact and potency.” All creatures are partial\nactualizations of truth. Ontological truth takes us to the heart of\nBonaventurean metaphysics. Aristotle’s definition of prime matter as\npure potency means that everything that contains potency of any sort,\neven an angel, must contain matter. This universal hylomorphism leads\nin turn to Bonaventure’s doctrine of being: “Matter gives\nindependent existence (existere) to form, while form gives\nthe act of being (essendi actum) to\n matter.”[50]\n Every created being (ens) is an ontological composite of\nindependent existence (existere) and being (esse),\nwhere esse signifies the nature or essence of the thing. From\nrocks to angels, all creatures are true to the extent that the\npotencies of their “existence” given by matter are\nrealized through the perfection of their “being” through\nform. \n\nThe participation premise moves from effect to cause within\nthe line of formal causality. A necessary condition for the existence\nof any attribute by participation is that the same attribute\nis present in its exemplar essentially, that is,\nintrinsically. Participation does not immediately take us to God, but\ninitially describes relations between creatures. A statue or computer\ncan have certain human attributes–shape, color, size,\ncomputational skill–but only because these features are caused\nby the artisan who made it. This is how participation works within\nthe created order. It is transcendenal “truth” that\nmoves the argument beyond creatures to God. If incomplete realization\nof an intrinsically imperfect categorical attribute–like white\nor horse or dirt–implies that those attributes must also exist\nin some other creature “essentially,” then transcendental\nattributes should behave the same way. But no creature could be such\nan exemplar. The exemplar for ontological truth must therefore be God,\nwho perfectly realizes his own essence, which is to say that God is\ntrue “essentially.” In On the Mystery of the\nTrinity, Bonaventure expands this line of argument further in the\ndirection of the transcendentals. There he identifies nine more\ndisjunctive transcendentals, in addition to the pair “by\nparticipation” and “essentially,” where the lesser\nimplies the existence of the\n greater.[51] \n\nJust as his illumination argument uncovered God as a kind of formal\nand efficient cause of certitude, so Bonaventure’s aitiological\nargument uncovers God as formal cause of truth in creatures. But in\naddition it ends just where his ontological argument begins. For what\ndoes an ontological argument do but peer into the inner logic of such\nan exemplar essence and try to capture the logical consequence that it\nmust exist? \n\nBonaventure was the first thirteenth-century thinker to pay serious\nattention to the ontological argument. He read the Proslogion\nof Anselm through Aristotelian lenses. Now Aristotle had recognized\nthree different kinds of scientific principles: common axioms\ngoverning all thought, so well known that no one can deny them, and\nproper principles limited in range to a given science–its\ndefinitions and postulates. Anselm seemed to mean that God’s existence\nis an axiom of thought known by all humans, and Bonaventure agrees:\n“since our intellect is never deficient in knowing about God\nif it is, so it cannot be ignorant of God’s existence,\nabsolutely speaking, nor even think God does not\n exist.”[52] \n\nWhile Anselm thought this conclusion rules out even the possibility of\natheism, Bonaventure more realistically shows how atheism is\npossible. The problem is with our defective knowledge of God’s\nnature. Error there can lead by logical inference to the\nconclusion that God does not exist in the first place. We are\nspontaneously theists, but can convince ourselves to become atheists.\nInadequate definition of God points to a second problem. Knowing God\nexists is similar to knowing axioms because both are recognized by\nall.  The difference is that we are quite certain “the whole is\ngreater than the part,” because the terms involved in this axiom\nare so familiar to us; but about God’s existence we have more an\nopinion than certain knowledge, because we lack an adequate definition\nof God’s nature. \n\nThere are two remedies for the defects in our knowledge of\n“what” God is, one taken from faith, the other from\nreason.  Both make knowledge of God’s existence more like a postulate\nknown with certitude by the “wise” than like an axiom\nrecognized by “all” humans (Boethius, De\nhebdomadibus, 40).  For Christian belief and for theology, God’s\nexistence is an article of faith. The other remedy is Bonaventure’s\nadaptation of Anselm’s argument conceived as a philosophical argument\non behalf of a metaphysical postulate. \n\nBonaventure’s ontological argument contains two moments, so to speak,\none negative, the other positive. Negatively, Bonaventure’s\nontological argument proceeds as a reduction to absurdity of the\natheistic proposition. Anselm had taken a peculiar description of God,\n“something than which a greater cannot be thought,” which\nAugustine had used to argue through a reductio ad absurdum to\nthe conclusion that God must be incorruptible, and Boethius used to\nargue that God must be good, and he had used it to argue by\nreductio that God must exist in the first place. Bonaventure\nrecognized the affinity with arguing by reductio in support\nof the principle of non-contradiction: \n\nBut his study of Aristotelian philosophy made Bonaventure more\nsensitive than Anselm to the limitations of reductio\narguments. Positive insight into principles is more than negative\nreductio leading up to principles, so snaring the atheist in\na contradiction is still one step away from affirming that God\nexists. To make this step intelligible he emended the ontological\nargument in a positive direction. \n\nBonaventure therefore explains what makes a proposition\n“self-evident,” which in turn opens the way for deducing\nGod’s existence out of God’s essence. \n\nPrinciples are “self-evident” (cf. Aristotle,\nTopics, 100a31–b21).  In the second of Aristotle’s\nmodes of per se (Aristotle, Posterior Analytics\n73a34–b3), the essence of the subject causes the\npredicate. This provided Bonaventure with an ingenious explanation of\nwhy principles are self-evident: “We know principles to the\nextent that we understand the terms which make them up, because the\ncause of the predicate is included in the subject.” If\nthe essence of the subject term is what connects it to the predicate\nterm in a self-evident proposition, then the essence of God must be\nwhat makes “God exists” self-evident. The positive\nontological argument contains an inference to the existence of God\nthat runs through the divine essence. \n\nMost descriptions of the divine essence are inappropriate for the\nontological argument, but the transcendentals are the right terms\nbecause they do not imply imperfection, can be predicated\nnon-metaphorically of God, and are primordial, the “first\nnotions falling into the\n mind.”[54]All more specific concepts presuppose transcendental\nnotions, and Anselm’s own formula was no exception to this rule. In\nhis Commentary on the Sentences Bonaventure used the\ntranscendental “true” as the middle term of his positive\nontological argument; in the disputed question On the Mystery of\nthe Trinity he used “good,” and in the Journey of\nthe Mind to God he used “being.” \n\nIn the Commentary, Bonaventure introduces his arguments for\nGod’s existence with an elaborate treatment of truth. As a relation,\ntruth always involves a comparison. Epistemological truth is an\n“indivision” between the human mind and the thing known.\nOntological truth is an “indivision” between potency and\nact within a creature; the more it fulfills its nature, the truer it\nis. These two senses of truth open up a comparison of creature as\nparticipant to God as exemplar. All three, epistemological,\nontological, participationist truths, are imperfect, combinations of\ntruth and falsity. They point to their exemplar, the one\n“pure” truth, present only in God, where there is\n“pure indivision mixed with no\n diversity.”[55]\n This last sense of truth Bonaventure uses in his ontological\nargument: \n\nBonaventure includes the negative reasoning so prominent in Anselm’s\nversion, but to Anselm’s formula he adds “being itself”\nand “the highest truth.” While each of these three\ndescriptions casts a different light on why the inference to God’s\nexistence is valid, Bonaventure here seems to prefer “the\nhighest truth” because the definition of truth as\n“indivision” is the basis for re-conceiving the\nontological argument as establishing an “indivision”\nbetween the middle term and the predicate “exists.” If the\n“highest truth” is “pure indivision,” then the\nhighest truth cannot be divided off from existence. \n\nIn On the Mystery of the Trinity, Bonaventure changes the\nfocus of the ontological argument to goodness, with a memorable\nresult.  The basic notion of goodness is not by itself sufficient to\nmount an ontological argument, but analysis of goodness uncovers the\nrelevant terms: \n\nThe logic of “the best” (optimum) is different\nfrom the logic of “the good.” Since goodness completes or\nperfects something, “the best” must be “a being\nwhich is fully complete (ens completissimum).” Now what\nis absolutely complete must possess all possible perfections. But\nexistence is not just a perfection, one component among many\nmaking up such ontological completeness, it is the most\nfundamental feature of such completeness. Consequently, such an\nabsolutely perfect being must exist. Bonaventure’s argument runs from\nthe subject “God,” through the middle terms “the\nbest” and “absolutely complete being,” to the\npredicate “exists.” In the shorter and even more memorable\nformulation, “If God is God, God is,” the premise If\nGod is God is not an empty tautology (Seifert 1992, 216–217).  It\nmeans ‘if the entity to which the term God refers truly\npossesses the divine essence.’ And the conclusion means that\nsuch an entity must exist. \n\nBonaventure was well aware of criticisms of the ontological argument,\nbeginning with Gaunilo’s retort that the greatest of all possible\nislands should also really exist. His reply is more effective than\nAnselm’s because it uses the transcendentals. An island is an\ninherently imperfect being (ens defectivum) because\ncategorical; but ens completissimum is not because a\n transcendental.[58] \n\nIn The Journey of the Mind to God, c. 5, Bonaventure focuses\nthe ontological argument on “being” and develops it far\nbeyond anything he had previously done. He qualifies esse in\ntwo different ways, creating two different middle terms: “divine\nbeing” (esse divinum) and “completely pure being\n(esse purissimum).” First he uses “completely\npure being” to deduce the predicate “exists,” then\nuses “divine being” to ensure that it is God who\nis so proven to exist. In this way the basic steps of this argument\nclosely parallel those of the argument based on goodness: ‘God\n(Deus) who is divine being (esse divinum) is also\nseen to be completely pure being (esse purissimum) and\ntherefore must exist (est).’ \n\nBonaventure\n begins[59]\n by repeating the essentials of the earlier versions of the argument,\nbut then moves well beyond them: \n\nIf “being itself” (ipsum esse) distinguishes the\nbeing (esse) of a creature from its independent existence\n(existere), adding the superlative completely pure\nto being itself (esse purissimum) refers to the\nnotion of an essence that does not involve non-being in\nany way: a completely pure or perfect essence. The notion of\nesse purissimum does not presuppose the real existence of\nGod; rather, it implies that real existence. But at this point this\ninference may not yet be clear, so Bonaventure devotes the rest of\nthis short text to showing why the notion of completely pure being\nitself actually entails the real existence of God. \n\nIn contrast with creatures, which are mid-level on the scale of being\nbecause they are open to existence and non-existence, the notions of\ncomplete nothingness (omnino nihil) and completely pure being\n(esse purissimum) have absolutely opposed implications for\nexistence. “Complete nothing-ness” is logically\ninconsistent with real existence, so there is a perfectly valid\ninference from the notion of nothing to non-being\n(non-esse). Nothing cannot exist. If the nature of nothing\nentails its non-existence, the nature of its opposite, completely\npure being, entails its real existence. Making use of the\ncategories of his own metaphysics in this way shows more effectively\nthan merely backing the mind into a contradiction why the ontological\ninference is valid. \n\nThe basis for the argument thus far is a notion, not of God but of an\nessence, completely pure, of non-being. One might ask where\nBonaventure acquires this notion, seemingly drawn from thin air. His\nreply is that conceptual analysis of the first of all notions,\ntranscendental being (ens), reveals this purely metaphysical\nnotion. \n\nHere Bonaventure peers into the notion of “a being”\n(ens) and finds it has two component principles: independent\nexistence (existere), which gives the being the potential to\nhave a certain essence; and being (esse), the actuality of\nsuch an essence. It is esse rather than existere\nwhich “denominates the pure actuality of a being.” Here\n“actuality” (actus) means ‘that which makes\nthe being actually intelligible, by giving it the actual essence it\nhas.’ This movement of conceptual analysis opens the\nmind to see that we can understand a creature as “a being”\n(ens) only by referring to the notion of an act of being\nwhich is pure from non-being (esse purum), indeed, which is\npure from any non-being (esse purissimum). Implicit\nwithin the very notion of transcendental “being”\nand a presupposition of our understanding the notion of\ntranscendental being, is the notion of being with no hint of\nnon-being (esse purissimum). Even if only implicit, this\nnotion must be present in the mind of anyone who understands being\n(ens), that is, everyone who understands anything at all. \n\nOnce it has been shown that esse purissimum is a notion which\nimplies real existence and that we all possess this notion as a\ncomponent of the fundamental notion of a being (ens), it\nremains only to identify esse purissimum with God. \n\nIf esse purissimum really exists, as has been proven, it must\nexist in one of three modes. But since particular and intentional\nbeing cannot be completely perfect, esse purissimum must be\nidentical with the divine being. \n\nThe real but initially hidden starting point for Bonaventure’s\nontological argument in the Journey is the notion of\nesse purissimum, taken not subjectively as existing as a\nconcept in a human mind, but in its objective\n meaning,[63]\n that is, as signifying a certain kind of quiddity or essence. The\nachievement of the ontological argument, as Bonaventure saw it, is\ntwofold: it shows that this essence must really exist, and it shows\nthat this essence is none other than God. \n\nBonaventure locates knowledge of God’s existence within all three\nparts of an Aristotelian science–as demonstrated conclusion, as\ncommon axiom, and as proper postulate. It can be proven through two\nkinds of demonstrations of the fact, by an illumination argument\nstarting inside the mind and an aitiological argument starting\noutside. Such proofs proceed from created truth as a vestige\nto the one God as its cause. But “God exists” is\nalso a principle recognized by virtually all humans, a kind of axiom\nbuilt upon creatures conceived as shadows of the one\ndivinity for whom explicit arguments specifying God’s causality are no\nmore needed than for other axioms. Finally, there are two ways God’s\nexistence is known as a postulate: first, through the ontological\nargument, where the transcendental attributes found in creatures\nfunction as vestiges providing the mind the notions it uses\nin the argument for the one God’s existence; and second, as\nan article of faith. Here faith is postulated on the authority of\nrevelation and is certain, but its certainty comes from God, not human\nreason. And here, too, features of intellectual creatures, especially\nhumans, function as images and likenesses of the\nTrinitarian God. Knowledge of God’s existence, in sum, is\nubiquitous. Thus spoke the follower of Francis.","contact.mail":"noonet@cua.edu","contact.domain":"cua.edu"},{"date.published":"2005-11-01","date.changed":"2020-12-01","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bonaventure/","author1":"Tim Noone","author1.info":"http://philosophy.cua.edu/Faculty/noone/","author2.info":"http://t4.stthom.edu/users/houser/index.html","entry":"bonaventure","body.text":"\n\n\n\nBonaventure of Bagnoregio (b. ca. 1217, d. 15 July 1274), the religious\nname of Giovanni di Fidanza, was a Franciscan friar, Master of\nTheology at the University of Paris, Minister General of the\nFranciscan Order, and Cardinal of the Catholic Church. During his\nlifetime he rose to become one of the most prominent men in Latin\nChristianity. His academic career as a theologian was cut short when\nin 1257 he was put in charge of the Order of Friars Minor (O.F.M.). He\nsteered the Franciscans on a moderate and intellectual course that\nmade them the most prominent order in the Catholic Church until the\ncoming of the Jesuits. His theology was marked by an attempt\ncompletely to integrate faith and reason. He thought of Christ as the\n“one true master” who offers humans knowledge that begins\nin faith, is developed through rational understanding, and is\nperfected by mystical union with God.\n\n\n  A master of the memorable phrase, Bonaventure held that philosophy\nopens the mind to at least three different routes humans can take on\ntheir journey to God. Non-intellectual material creatures he conceived\nas shadows and vestiges (literally, footprints) of God, understood as\nthe ultimate cause of a world philosophical reason can prove was\ncreated at a first moment in time. Intellectual creatures he conceived\nof as images and likenesses of God, the workings of the human mind and\nwill leading us to God understood as illuminator of knowledge and\ndonor of grace and virtue. The final route to God is the route of\nbeing, in which Bonaventure brought Anselm’s argument together with\nAristotelian and Neoplatonic metaphysics to view God as the absolutely\nperfect being whose essence entails its existence, an absolutely\nsimple being that causes all other, composite beings to exist. These\nthree routes are outlined in Sections 3, 4, and 5 below.\n\n\n\nOn 2 February 1257, Br. Bonaventure was appointed Minister General\nin charge of the Franciscan\n Order.[1]\n This act of ecclesiastical preferment effectively split his life into\ntwo halves, the burdens of the ecclesiastical administrator replacing\nthe leisure of the scholar. He is thought to have been forty years old\nat the time—the minimum age for a Minister General—giving\nhim a birth date of 1217. \n\nBonaventure was born Giovanni di Fidanza in Bagnoregio in Tuscany.  He\nhimself attests that he was healed miraculously as a child by the\nintervention of Francis of Assisi, shortly after the saint’s death on\n3 October\n 1226[2]:\n “when I was a boy, as I still vividly remember, I was snatched\nfrom the jaws of death by his invocation and merits.” He did not\nrush to join the Franciscans, but matriculated as a layman in the Arts\nfaculty at the University of Paris in 1235 and proceeded all the way\nto the Master of Arts, around 1243.  The Arts curriculum at Paris then\nconsisted of the seven liberal arts, supplemented by some works of\nAristotle. Heavily weighted in favor of the trivium—the\nlinguistic arts of grammar, rhetoric, and logic—teaching in the\nquadrivium—the four mathematical and scientific\ndisciplines—was somewhat limited, partially due to the\nprohibition of Aristotle’s works in natural philosophy at Paris in\n1210. Though some Masters of Arts, such as Roger Bacon and Richard\nRufus, were teaching the Aristotelian natural philosophy, the\nrequirements for becoming a Master of Arts as late as 1252 listed only\nthe old logic, new logic, and the On the Soul (De\nanima) among Aristotle’s works; the earliest record of\nAristotle’s entire natural philosophy and metaphysics as required for\ngraduation only appears in\n 1255,[3]\n two years before Bonaventure left the University. His writing\nreflects this education; a master of logic and rhetoric, he was less\ndeeply read in the Aristotelian and Islamic philosophical texts than\nhis Dominican contemporaries, Albert and Thomas. \n\nAbout the time young Giovanni began to study Arts, Alexander of Hales,\nMaster of Theology and initiator of the practice of commenting on the\nSentences of Peter Lombard, took the Franciscan habit. His conversion\ngave the Franciscans a Chair in Theology, the Dominicans having\nacquired two Chairs during the university strike of 1229–30.  Hales\nheld him in the highest regard and said that “in him Adam seemed\nnot to have sinned” (Salimbene 1905–1912, 664).  Giovanni took\nthe Franciscan habit in 1243/4, using the name\n“Bonaventure” to celebrate his “good-fortune”\nunder Francis and Hales. \n\nBonaventure attended lectures and disputations in theology from 1243\nto 1248. Writing about 1280, the Franciscan chronicler Salimbene said:\n“Br. John of Parma [Franciscan Minister General] gave the\nlicense to Br. Bonaventure of Bagnoregio to read at Paris, which he\nhad never yet done because he was not yet installed in a Chair. He\nthen read the whole Gospel of St. Luke, a commentary that is very\nbeautiful and complete. This was in\n 1248.”[4]\n This entry refers to Bonaventure’s cursorie lectures as\n“Bachelor of the Bible,” 1248–1250. From 1250–2 he\ncommented on the Sentences (Sententiae in IV Libris\nDistinctae). Once Master, he revised the Commentary\n(Commentaria in Quatuor Libros Sententiarum), his major\nphilosophical and theological work. In 1252–3 he was a “formed\nBachelor” of Theology, performing the three duties of a Master:\nlecturing on the Bible, engaging in disputations, and preaching. In\n1253 the Masters and students of the University of Paris went on\nstrike, all but the friars.  The two Dominicans and William of\nMeliton, O.F.M., continued to teach and refused to take an oath of\nloyalty to the University corporation, for which they were expelled\nfrom the “university of masters,” an action defended by\nthe University in a letter of 4\n February.[5]\n Bonaventure received the licentia docendi by Easter 1254, in\nthe midst of this conflict. He assumed the Franciscan Chair in\ntheology immediately, but taught only at the Franciscan convent,\nunrecognized by the University. \n\nBonaventure performed all three tasks of a Master of Theology from\n1254–57. He revised his commentary on Luke and composed commentaries\non John and Ecclesiastes. He also held three sets of disputed\nquestions. The questions On the Knowledge of Christ (De\nscientia Christi), which develop his illumination theory of\nknowledge, probably came out of his inception as Master in 1254. The\nquestions On the Mystery of the Trinity (De mysterio\nTrinitatis), which elaborated his view of God, were likely the\nlast ones he wrote (Hayes 1992, 40–44; 1979, 24–29).  Both were\ncomposed in a lofty style that gives no evidence of the conflict\nembroiling Paris at the time. The third set of disputed questions,\nhowever, were On Evangelical Perfection (De perfectione\nevangelica) and consisted in a defense of the friars’ way of\nlife, under attack by non-mendicant Masters led by William of\nSt. Amour. In October 1256, Pope Alexander IV ordered the secular\nMasters at Paris to accept Bonaventure and the Dominican Thomas of\nAquino in their rightful places as Masters of Theology, but it was not\nuntil 12 August 1257 that they did so. But six months earlier\nBonaventure had been appointed Minister\n General.[6]\n In addition to the normal magisterial writings, Bonaventure also\nwrote On Retracing the Arts to Theology (Opusculum de\nreductione artium ad theologiam) while Master; and probably in\n1257, while leaving the University, he managed to compose his\nBreviloquium, a “short reading” that contains in\noutline the main theses of a theological summa that would never be\ncomposed.  \n\nFrom this point on, Bonaventure’s writing reflected the needs of the\nOrder, but he did not cast aside his philosophical mind.  Bonaventure\nquickly set a firm direction for the Order in an “encyclical\nletter” to all the friars on 23 April 1257, which admonished\nthem to recover the “somewhat tarnished” luster of the\nOrder. The Minister General followed with three tracts written in\n1259–60 for the spiritual edification of the friars: A Soliloquy\nabout Four Mental Exercises (Soliloquium de quatuor\nmentalibus exercitiis), The Tree of Life (Lignum\nvitae), and The Triple Way (De Triplici\nvia). \n\nBonaventure’s most influential work over the centuries was composed at\nthis time. For Francis’s feast day in October, 1259, Bonaventure\nvisited Mt. Alverna, the very place where Francis himself had received\na mystical vision of Christ “under the appearance” of\n“a Seraph having six wings” and had had “imprinted\nin his flesh” the stigmata or wounds of\n Christ[7]\n Here Bonaventure conceived the idea for his Journey of the Mind\nto God (Itinerarium mentis in Deum), a mental and\nspiritual journey to God whose basic outline—though not its\ndetails—could be understood by even the simplest friar. The\njourney follows the route first charted by St.  Augustine—from\nthe exterior world to the interior mind, and from the interior but\ninferior human mind to the superior mind, namely, to God. Bonaventure\nallegorically understood the six wings of the angelic Seraph Francis\nsaw to stand for six ways God can be approached and therefore arranged\nhis Journey into seven chapters. The two lower wings of the\nSeraph symbolize seeing God through “footprints\n(vestigia),” signs in the sub-human world that point to\nGod, including signs in the physical universe itself (c. 1) and signs\nfound in the sensory life humans have in common with other animals\n(c. 2). The two middle wings of the Seraph symbolize seeing God in his\n“image,” namely, in humans understood as bearing within\ntheir intellectual nature special signs pointing to God.  Here\nBonaventure distinguished signs of God found in the\n“natural” exercise of the mind in theoretical knowledge\n(c.  3) from those found in its exercise in the practical sphere\n“reformed by grace” (c. 4). The two highest wings of the\nSeraph symbolize seeing God in himself, first in the way reason sees\nGod as having one divine nature (c. 5) and then as faith sees God in\nthe Trinity of persons (c. 6). These three sets of twin\n“steps” culminate in the “mental and mystical\ntransport” found in mystical experience (c. 7), the end of the\nJourney. For each step, Bonaventure used material from\nearlier writings; but the Journey, like all his later works,\nis only a sketch the Minister General knew he would never have the\nleisure to complete. The result is his writing achieves a combination\nof scriptural imagery, philosophic depth, mystical yearning, and\ndensity more meditative than demonstrative. But the Journey\ndoes provide an appropriate outline for looking at Bonaventure’s\nphilosophy. After considering his views on the relation of philosophy,\nfaith, and theology (Section 2), we shall look respectively at\nBonaventure’s views on physical creation (Section 3), human nature and\ncognition (Section 4), and on God (Section 5). \n\nThe General Chapter of 1260 held in Narbonne, France, the first where\nBonaventure presided, ratified his codification of the legal statutes\nunder which Franciscans lived, known as the “Constitutions of\nNarbonne” and also asked him to write a definitive Life of\nSt. Francis, which he did in 1261. These two works set the Order\non a moderate course that lasted for centuries and led Franciscans to\ncall Bonaventure their “second founder.” \n\nFor most of the period from 1257 through 1266 Bonaventure trekked\nthrough France and Italy by foot, as did all friars when they\ntraveled.  In 1266 he returned to Paris, where his friars were under\nattack both from conservatives in the Theology faculty and from\nradicals in Arts.  Bonaventure began a series of writings devoted\nprimarily to moral matters: Collations on the Ten\nCommandments (Collationes de decem praeceptis), Lent of\n1267; Collations on the Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit\n(Collationes de septem donis Spiritus sancti), Lent of 1268;\na defense of the friars bearing the Socratic title Apologia\npauperum (Defense of the Mendicants), 1269. On 10\nDecember 1270, Etienne Tempier, bishop of Paris, condemned certain\nerroneous Aristotelian propositions. During Easter-tide of 1273\nBonaventure delivered his magisterial Collations on the\nHexameron (Collationes in Hexaemeron). \n\nThe last period of Bonaventure’s life saw him rise to become one of\nthe most prominent men in Christendom. During the three year Papal\nvacancy, from 29 November 1268 to 1 September 1271, Bonaventure\npreached an important sermon in Viterbo and was probably instrumental\nin the invention of conclave. He is said to have been offered the\npapacy by the electors and to have suggested Teobaldi Visconti\ninstead.  After Teobaldi’s election as Pope Gregory X, he appointed\nBonaventure cardinal on 28 May\n 1273,[8]\n where he preached on reunification of eastern and western Churches, a\nmajor goal of the council which seemed to have been achieved when he\nsuddenly fell ill on 15 July 1274 and “at the hour of Matins\ndied Br. Bonaventure of happy memory, Bishop of Albano, who was a man\neminent for his knowledge and eloquence (homo eminentis scientie\net eloquentie), a man outstanding for his sanctity and\nacknowledged for the excellence of his life, both religious and\nmoral…Br. Peter of Tarantasia [also a Cardinal] celebrated the\nfuneral mass and preached on the theme ‘I am saddened over you,\nmy brother Jonathan.’ There were many tears and much weeping,\nfor the Lord had given him such grace that the hearts of all who saw\nhim were seized with a desire for his\n love.”[9] \n\nWithout exception, every word of philosophy Bonaventure ever wrote is\ncontained in works explicitly religious—in sermons, works of\nspiritual direction, and theology. He never wrote the kind of\nintroductions to the principles of metaphysics and natural philosophy\nthat Thomas Aquinas composed in his On Being and Essence\n(De ente et essentia) and On the Principles of\nNature (De principiis naturae), nor did he comment on\nAristotle’s works. Commentators writing during the twentieth century\nneo-thomistic revival compared Bonaventure with three other thinkers:\nAristotle, Augustine, and Aquinas. P. Mandonnet thought he had no\nphilosophy of his own, but was an Augustinian theologian, pure and\nsimple, all of whose conclusions depend on faith. E. Gilson thought\nBonaventure developed an Augustinian philosophy within his theology:\n“with St. Bonaventure the mystical synthesis of mediaeval\nAugustinianism was fully formed, just as that of Christian\nAristotelianism was fully formed with St. Thomas.” F. Van\nSteenberghen thought his philosophy a failed Aristotelianism separate\nfrom but at the service of his Augustinian\n theology.[10]\n None of these interpretations quite captures Bonaventure’s relation\nto these three philosophers or his own approach to the relations among\nreason, faith, and theology, because they implicitly employed a\nThomistic model for being an Aristotelian, with the result that\nBonaventure’s failures derive from his not being the kind of\nAristotelian Thomas Aquinas was. \n\nBonaventure’s approach to Aristotle was quite different from Albert\nand Thomas. He felt no need for detailed knowledge of the text of\nAristotle. As a student in Arts he had learned from his Masters, not\nfrom detailed study of Aristotle’s text, broadly Aristotelian\nphilosophical principles—the categories and transcendentals, the\ncauses and predicables, and fundamental notions like potency and act,\npossible and necessary—sufficient to do his own work. As a\nphilosopher and theologian, he was perfectly capable of using such\nborrowed principles to draw his own conclusions, ones which he himself\nsaid depended more on Alexander of Hales than on any philosopher:\n“For I do not intend to advocate new opinions, but to reweave\nthe common and approved ones.” Consequently, Bonaventure was not\na failed Aristotelian for the simple reason that he never tried to be\nan Aristotelian in the Dominican way at all. On the other hand, while\nAugustine was clearly Bonaventure’s favorite theological authority, he\nwas not, properly speaking, an Augustinian. Even when he draws\nAugustinian conclusions, Bonaventure does not employ Augustinian\narguments. In truth, Bonaventure was, broadly speaking, an\nAristotelian in his philosophical principles, but not in his\nconclusions. A better way to describe his philosophical conclusions\nand his way of drawing them is that his thought was\nFranciscan in inspiration and Bonaventurean in\nexecution. \n\nThe pressing issue concerning philosophy, faith, and theology in the\n1250s was how to set up theology as an Aristotelian demonstrative\nscience. Albert had done so in his commentary on the\nSentences (1243–9), which Bonaventure had on hand when\nwriting his own commentary. Demonstration is causal knowledge, and a\nscience in Aristotle’s sense is systematic knowledge of one limited\nsubject developed through demonstrating necessary conclusions by\nmaking use of certain fundamental causal principles relevant to the\nsubject at hand.  The task theology had set itself, then, was to\ndiscover and present systematically the truths set out in that most\nunsystematic of books—the Bible. \n\nSince a “science” is causal knowledge, Bonaventure devoted\nthe four questions of the prologue to his commentary on Book 1 of the\nSentences, which serves as his introduction the whole\n“science” of theology, to its four causes—efficient,\nfinal, formal, and material. These causes in turn clarify the\nrelations between philosophy, faith, and theology. \n\nSince science exists as an intellectual habit in the mind of the\nknower, the efficient cause of any book of theology is the\nauthor who wrote it, Peter Lombard in the case of his\nSentences, Bonaventure himself in the case of his commentary.\nLombard was no mere scribe, compiler, or commentator; he was an\n“author,” and the same is true of Bonaventure\nhimself. This simple point distinguishes faith, whose sole efficient\ncause is God working through grace, from both philosophy and theology,\nwhose efficient cause is the human mind, though even here God has a\nrole to play. \n\nWhen he came to clarify the end of theology, Bonaventure\nunderstood that Aristotle had sharply distinguished practical\nscience—whose end is deeds—from theoretical\nscience—whose end is knowledge. So he asks whether theology is\n“for the sake of contemplation or for the sake of our becoming\ngood.” The answer is that theology is more perfect than any\nphilosophical science because it breaks through the bounds of this\nAristotelian dichotomy. Neither theoretical knowledge nor practical\ndeeds get to the center of the moral life, which is love—both\nthe “affection” of love and the theological virtue of\ncharity.  The kind of intellectual virtue that prepares the mind for\ncharity is a “wisdom” that “involves knowledge and\naffection together.” The “knowledge that Christ died for\nus,” for example, is far different from the knowledge of the\ngeometer or the knowledge of the general. Consequently, theological\nwisdom is both “for the sake of contemplation and also for our\nbecoming good, but principally for the sake of our becoming\ngood” through enlivening our knowledge and deeds with Christian\n“affection”. \n\nThe form that produces “science” is its\n“method of proceeding.” Now “the end imposes\nnecessity on the means, since ‘teeth are sharp in order to\ncut,’ as Aristotle says.” Since theology is\n“designed to promote the faith,” it employs “the\nmethod of argumentation or inquiry” first developed by\nAristotle. By adapting the philosophical method to the data of faith,\ntheology attempts to “confound the adversaries of the\nfaith,” “strengthen those weak in their faith,” and\n“delight those whose faith is complete.” Bonaventure\nsituated theology within the hierarchy of the sciences by adverting to\nAristotle’s notion of “subalternated sciences.” The\nPhilosopher had recognized that optics—which studies visible\nlines—is a science “subalternated” to\ngeometry—which studies lines as such. Theology depends upon\nScripture in a similar way, for scripture offers certain truths to be\nbelieved, but theology looks at the same truths “as made\nintelligible.” In this way, theology is different from the faith\nit tries to understand and from the Scripture that offers faith to\n us.[11] \n\nTo understand theology as a “science” making faith\nintelligible, Bonaventure must clarify its material cause.\nDetermining that material cause of theology is the same as\nsettling on its subject. On this point, there had been\nconsiderable dispute among the Masters. Aristotle’s\n“sciences” were all limited to a particular genus, such as\n“animal” or “soul” or “memory” or\n“ethics.” Even his universal science of metaphysics was\nlimited to studying substances; it eschewed the other categories.\nTheology, by contrast, cuts across all genera and includes God, who is\nnot confined within any genus. Bonaventure was familiar with many\naccounts of the subject of theology: “things and signs,”\nthe work of “reparation for sin,” “Christ—head\nand members,” “God,” and “the object of\nbelief” (credibile). To throw light on these conflicting\nanswers, Bonaventure turned to his study of the Arts. Priscian had\nnoted three different senses of the subject of grammar. Its subject in\nthe sense of its “root principle” is the\n“letter” that makes up words; its subject conceived as an\n“integral whole” is “a fitting and complete\noration;” and its subject conceived as “universal\nwhole” is “meaningful sound, articulated and\nordered.” There are three correlative senses of the subject of\ntheology: “God” is the “principle” of the\nsubject and “Christ—head and members” is the\n“integral whole,” the entirety of what theology\nstudies. But the most important sense of “subject” is the\n“universal whole.” Therefore, “the subject of this\nbook, properly speaking,” is the “object of belief,”\na subject that lets theology range over all realities and all thoughts\nabout which one can have religious faith. \n\nBonaventure does not explicitly address the principles of theology.\nBut he further clarifies its “subject” in a way that\npoints to those principles. To faith, Scripture adds the notion of\n“authority,” and to the faith and authority of Scriptural\nrevelation, theology adds “proof.” Theology presupposes\nfaith but adds to it rational demonstrations about matters of faith.\nConsequently, Bonaventure adds a telling qualification to his\ndescription of the subject of theology. Theology’s subject is the\nobject of belief “in so far as the believable is transformed\ninto the notion of the intelligible, and this happens by the addition\nof\n reasoning.”[12]\n With this concise formula, Bonaventure includes within theology both\nreligious belief transformed by arguments from natural reason and\nnatural reason transformed by arguments based on religious\nrevelation. If so, then theology must have the kinds of principles\nthat make possible both kinds of arguments: the fundamental truths of\nfaith drawn from the Bible and tradition, but also fundamental truths\nof reason. What makes all such basic truths theological is their\nargumentative function. Theological arguments may draw from revelation\nby using revealed truths as premises and they may draw from reason by\nusing rational truths as premises. Both kinds of arguments are\ntheological because of the use to which they are put. In this way,\nphilosophical reasoning has an integral place within the\ndomain of Bonaventurean theology. \n\nBonaventure showed how philosophical reasoning works in theology in\nthe very structure of his disputed question On the Mystery of the\nTrinity. Each question is divided into two articles, the first\nproven using rational premises and the second proven using premises\ndrawn from faith. In Question 1, for example, God is rationally proven\nto exist in Art. 1, then shown to be a trinity of persons using\narguments based on faith and reason in Art. 2. Theology, then,\nconsists most fundamentally in the understanding that results from\njoining rational arguments and faith-based arguments\n together.[13]\n The same mode of reasoning is found in On Reducing the Arts to\nTheology. Here “reduction” consists in developing\nanalogies that move the mind from the liberal arts to theology and\nback again. Bonaventure argues for each point by combining one claim\nbased on reason with another based on revelation, as though they were\nwall and buttress of the cathedral of theology. Philosophical\nreasoning, then, is an absolutely integral part of Bonaventure’s\nfaith-based theology. \n\nIn the first step of the Journey Bonaventure focuses upon the\nsensible objects of the physical world around us, both taken in\nthemselves and in reference to our sense awareness of them. Like all\ncreatures, sensible things are understood to be signs that ultimately\ncan direct humans to the divine art or wisdom through which all things\nhave been made. Bonaventure’s semiotics distinguishes four sorts of\nsigns. All creatures can be seen as “shadows”\n(umbra) and “vestiges” (lit. footprints,\nvestigia): “For a creature is called a shadow based on\nits properties which point to God in some type of causality in an\nindeterminate way. But a creature is called a vestige based on\nproperties which point to God as triple cause–efficient, formal,\nand final cause; for example, the properties: one, true, and\n good.”[14] \n In addition, Bonaventure posits two higher types of semiosis\npertinent solely to rational creatures, which are “images”\n(imago) pointing to the First Principle through its properly\nrational powers which have their source and highest object in God and\n“likenesses” (similitudo) of God to the extent\nthat they are recipients of divine grace and conform themselves to the\ndivine will. All creatures, from rocks to angels, are signs in the\nsense of shadows and traces of God, for they all bear a relation of\ncausal dependency upon God as their source; but only rational\ncreatures can have the divine as an object of their activities and,\nfor that reason, can conform themselves to the divine will and become\nlikenesses of God. \n\nBonaventure’s understanding of the physical world is heavily indebted\nto two fundamental sources: the Biblical account of creation, mediated\nby Patristic commentaries, and the Aristotelian view of nature, taken\nchiefly from Aristotle’s writings on natural philosophy, such as the\nPhysics (Physica) and On the Heavens\n(De caelo), but combined with the commentaries of Averroes,\nthe tracts of Avicenna, and the Timaeus of Plato in the Latin\ntranslation of Chalcidius. Bonaventure constructs a view of the\nphysical world that is indebted to both of his fundamental sources,\nbut ultimately gives the Scriptural text and the related Patristic\ntradition precedence whenever his sources come into conflict. His\nmanner of synthesizing those sources into a coherent and impressive\nwhole is what gives his views on nature their distinctive\ncharacter. \n\nThe tension between the newly translated Aristotelian corpus and the\ntraditional theological teaching of the Church regarding the doctrine\nof creation was well understood by Bonaventure’s time. Indeed, the\nprohibitions of 1215 and 1231 regarding the teaching of the\nAristotelian writings on natural philosophy had given way to the\ndirect teaching of Aristotle in the Faculty of Arts by the time\nBonaventure took his master of arts degree at the University of Paris,\nand by the time he left the University, the Aristotelian corpus in its\nentirety was a subject of examination for candidates for degrees in\nthe Faculty of Arts. Yet the Aristotelian doctrine of the eternity of\nthe world was given various interpretations. Some favored a benign\ninterpretation, claiming that all Aristotle meant in Physics\nVIII was that the world and its motion did not arise from some earlier\nmotion, but rather time, moveable things, and motion were all coeval\nand\n concomitant.[15]\n Others, however, chief among them Robert Grosseteste, argued that the\nviews of Aristotle should be taken at face value and what the\nStagirite intended was the eternity of the past; the Greek Fathers and\nAristotle’s own commentators both were in accord that the Aristotelian\noutlook involved the beginninglessness of the past and unoriginated\n matter.[16] \n\nBonaventure’s own position takes its origins from a combination of\nelements coming from Alexander of Hales and Grosseteste.  Following\nthe lead of the latter, Bonaventure rejects, albeit with some\nhesitation, the benign reading of the Stagirite; in all likelihood,\nAristotle did intend to teach that the world was beginningless: \n\nYet the most striking feature of Bonaventure’s account of the\nphilosophers is the manner in which he juxtaposes the doctrine of\ncreation, as he understands it, with the philosophical theory of\norigins. According to Bonaventure, only two theories regarding the\norigin of the cosmos are really tenable: first, the theory of the\npagan philosophers according to which the world is eternal and the\nmatter of the universe is without ultimate causal origin; second, the\nChristian doctrine of creation according to which the universe depends\nentirely for its being on God, is produced “from nothing (ex\nnihilo),” and is temporally finite in the past. The third\npossibility, namely that the world is both produced from nothing and\neternal, Bonaventure vehemently rejects on the grounds that such a\nposition is inherently contradictory: \n\nReturning to the last argument, we find the reasoning to which\nBonaventure refers. The argument is an elegant synthesis and\nrestatement of the position of Parisian theologians since the time of\nWilliam of Auxerre, but is especially indebted to the\nQuaestiones of Alexander of Hales. Everything that depends\nentirely for its being on something else is produced by that thing\nfrom nothing. The world depends entirely for its being on God. Hence,\nthe world must be produced from nothing. If the world is produced from\nnothing, it must either arise out of the “nothing” as out\nof matter or out of the “nothing” as out of a point of\norigin. The world cannot arise out of nothing as out of matter. Thus\nthe world must arise out of nothing as out of a point of origin. If,\nhowever, the world arises out of nothing as out of a point of origin,\nthen the world has being after non-being. Nothing having being after\nnon-being can be eternal. The world, as a created thing, has being\nafter non-being. Therefore, the world, precisely as created “out\nof nothing,” cannot be\n eternal.[19]\n The philosophical force of the expression that there be a logical\nmoment at which we could say that the world is not and with reference\nto which the world begins to be. The ontological reference of such a\nlogical moment is the divine eternity with respect to which\n(‘after’ which) the world begins. \n\nTo Bonaventure’s mind, the creationist view of the universe alone\naccounts for the total being of the universe in the sense of\nexplaining both its structure and the fact that it exists; the view of\nthe ancients only explains the order and the pattern of the universe\nwithout reaching the depths of accounting for why the universe exists\nat all. A sign of this shortcoming is to be seen in the shared\npresupposition of Plato and Aristotle that matter is unoriginated.\nFurthermore, to the extent that the ancient pagan views of the\nuniverse involve the infinity of past time, with all the philosophical\ndifficulties that the eternity of past time entails, natural reason\nwould seem capable of arriving, in principle, at the conclusion that\nthe world was created, even though, historically speaking, the\ngreatest of the ancient philosophers failed to do so. \n\nThe conflict between Scriptural sources and the Aristotelian writings\non the issue of the primordial state of matter is not so severe,\nbecause in the Aristotelian corpus there is no description of the\nprimordial state of matter, and the other sources available to\nBonaventure are themselves in disagreement. Augustine, for example,\nhad suggested in his literal commentary on Genesis that the matter of\nthe world could have been made all at once, whereas in his\nConfessions (Confessiones) he had suggested that\nthere might be an indeterminate and inchoate initial state of\nmatter. This possibiliity was further corroborated by such pagan\nauthors as Plato and Ovid, who had posited a primordial chaotic state\nof matter out of which the present cosmic order gradually emerged\n(Plato, Timaeus 52D-53C, 54–55; Ovid, Metamorphoses,\n43:5–45:7). \n\nBonaventure begins by distinguishing the consideration of matter from\nthe actual existence of matter in the order of natural\n history.[20]\n We may consider matter simply as a constitutive principle of things\nand as such it is pure potency; this is the way that the concept of\nmatter functions in Aristotle’s Physics and, to Bonaventure’s\nmind, how Augustine spoke of matter in the Confessions. But\nwe may also think of matter as it actually exists in time. In this\nrespect, matter never exists and cannot exist as lacking all\nform. Such a claim, however, does not require that material creation\nwas brought forth as fully formed, even if such a position might be\nmore philosophically defensible than its\n opposite.[21]\n Instead, Bonaventure suggests that physical matter was created in a\nstate wherein it had a tendency and capacity to admit many different\nforms, though it had none of them in its own right. Rather, its\npotentiality to develop distinct forms required further external,\ndivine agency in order for the distinct things having diverse forms to\nfully\n emerge.[22]\n Physical matter’s properties in its incomplete state included\nextension and visibility (properties arising from the form common to\nall physical things, namely, light). These features are still shared\nby all the items in the physical world, even though Bonaventure\nadmits, in accord with the Aristotelian teaching on the heavens, that\nheavenly bodies, such as the stars, have matter that differs in kind\nfrom that of terrestrial things. Accordingly, after things were fully\nproduced matter was twofold, terrestrial and celestial, but in its\nprimordial state physical matter enjoyed a corresponding unity that\nwas one of contiguity, i.e., it was one\n mass.[23]\n This primordial unity of physical matter continues to have some\nscientific bearing for Bonaventure since it grounds the consideration\nof the general physicist who may prescind from the process of\ngeneration and corruption and consider bodies simply in terms of their\nmobility in place and\n extension.[24] \n\nBonaventure’s treatment of light is mainly found in the discussion of\nlight in his commentary on Lombard’s Sentences, Bk. 2, d.\n13. In this theological context, light mainly bears upon the work of\nthe six days of creation, and Bonventure must take a position on the\nGenesis account of the creation of light. Though he acknowledges\nAugustine’s spiritualizing interpretation of light, an interpretation\nthat identifies the light spoken of in Genesis with the creation and\nactivities of the angels, Bonaventure inclines to a more literal\n interpretation.[25]\n This means that Bonaventure had to take a position on the\ncontemporary debates on light and its nature. \n\nThe two positions that Bonaventure discusses are what we may call a\nbroadly Aristotelian position, one eventually adopted by Thomas\nAquinas, and a broadly Augustinian position advocated by Robert\nGrosseteste in his On light (De luce). According to\nthe first, light is simply an accidental form, one found in degrees in\ndifferent bodies, but according to the second, light is perhaps a\nsubstance or at least a substantial form communicating extension and\nvisibility to physical things. \n\nBonaventure discounts the possibility that light is a substance,\nbecause it is purely active and if it were a substance in its own\nright it would be God and not a creature. He does allow, however, that\nlight is a substantial form and is the substantial form that is\nconcomitant with the mass of matter in its primordial\n state.[26]\n In this originating condition, light gave the mass of matter its\nextension and visibility and the hierarchy of heavenly bodies\ncorresponds to the hierarchy of things capable of partaking either\nmore or less in the light that renders bodies active and extended. For\nBonaventure, then, light is a substantial form, but only the partial\nperfection of any given physical substance, whether celestial or\nterrestrial. Since Bonaventure endorses, usually without any elaborate\nargumentation, the general claim that there is a plurality of\nsubstantial forms within any composite thing, his doctrine of light\nreally means that light is the first form, endowing each thing with\nextension, and preparing the way for further perfections such as the\nforms of the elements or the forms of mixtures or compounds. \n\nThe transition in the order of natural history from bodies that are\nsimply such, extended and endowed with the ability to act and be acted\nupon, to the bodies of plants and animals is explained in part through\nthe motions of the celestial bodies and their causal influences on\nmatter. In part, however, matter itself has latent structures that\nsimply await the correct circumstances and conditions to cause the\nemergence of a higher type of body. These latent structures,\noriginally sown into matter at its creation, Bonaventure calls,\nfollowing the terminology of St. Augustine, rationes\nseminales or seminal reasons, a term hearkening back to the\ncosmology of the ancient Stoics.  Seminal reasons amount to a\nlingering impact of the creator on the matter of the physical world\nsince their presence in matter originates with creation. In physical\nscience, Bonaventure believes seminal reasons help to explain the\nsuccessive emergence of the different kinds of bodies suitable for\nhigher and higher types of life. But this process of gradual emergence\ndoes not apply to the creation of human life, since human souls for\nBonaventure are incorruptible and can only arise through the direct\naction of the creator. \n\nThough from our post-Darwinian perspective we may be tempted to see in\nthe doctrine of seminal reasons, whether in Augustine or Bonaventure,\na curious, yet awkward anticipation of the doctrine of evolution,\nsimilarities between the doctrine of seminal reasons and certain\nelements in evolutionary theory are more apparent than real.  First,\nthough seminal reasons do provide directionality and progression for\nthe succession of physical types in natural history, they are\nthemselves latent forms within matter and not reducible to more\nfundamental mechanical or chemical processes; rather, they underlie\nsuch processes. Second, seminal reasons are never appealed to in order\nto explain the demise of one living species and the emergence of\nanother species to replace the former, a key feature of Darwinian\nexplanations. Third, seminal reasons are not, as we have just seen,\nuniversal in their application to the living things that occur within\nthe order of natural history; human beings, at least in terms of their\nsouls, fall outside the range of influence of seminal reasons. \n\nBonaventure’s doctrines regarding living things are mainly inspired by\nan Aristotelian biology. Living things are such thanks to the kind of\nforms they have, namely, soul, which is defined as the first actuality\nof a body having life potentially. Soul is understood as the form that\nmakes a thing alive and able to enjoy the type of life that it\ndoes. Consequently, souls are termed either vegetative, sensitive, or\nrational, according to the functions that the living things themselves\nexercise. \n\nThe world as it is revealed to us through the senses provides the\nmeans for our re-entering ourselves and ascending to higher things.\nFurthermore, the senses themselves are equally signs of higher\nthings. \n\nPhysical things considered in their own right evidence “weight,\nnumber, and measure” (Psalm 83:8), thereby causing us to\ncontemplate their own measure, beauty, and order. These features are\ngrounded in the activities and natural powers of sensible\nsubstances. The nature of sensible substances accordingly expresses in\ntheir actions and interactions the measure, beauty, and order of their\norigin and thereby attest to the power, wisdom, and goodness of the\nSource from which they\n spring.[27]\n Likewise, the origin, size, number, beauty, fullness, function, and\norigin of physical things point to the Divine Source and its essential\nproperties of power, wisdom, and\n goodness.[28] \n\nThe pointing of physical things towards their Source finds its\nparallel in sense cognition itself, which also points towards that\nsame Source. Drawing his point of departure from the Neoplatonic theme\nof macrocosm and microcosm, Bonaventure discovers an analogy between\nAristotelian cosmology and the process of sensation. Each sensible\nobject generates a likeness of itself in the medium through which it\nis perceived, and that likeness in turn generates another likeness\nsuccessively in the sense organ, causing the sense power to apprehend\nthe sensible object. The process so described reflects the process of\nthe emanation of forms from the heavenly bodies and also the manner in\nwhich creatures, going forth from their Principle, return to their\nSource through the exercise of their natural activities. A similar\npattern emerges within the different acts exercised by each sense\npower: the sense apprehends (apprehensio) the object,\ndelights (delectatio) in its object, provided that the object\ndoes not exceed the natural limits of the organ, and judges\n(diiudicatio) or discriminates the quality of its\nobject. This last act, found in both the external senses and the\ninternal senses, takes on a special role for Bonaventure. Such a sense\njudgement, through comparative awareness, detaches the object from a\ngiven place and time, thereby preparing the way within the realm of\nsense cognition for intellectual\n cognition.[29] \n\nWhen we arrive at the threshold of intellectual cognition, we are\nentering the next step along the Bonaventurian journey. This level of\ncreaturely being points to the Divine Source, but in ways that are\nmore direct than those in which sensible creatures do. In exercising\ntheir powers of intellect and will, intellectual creatures discover\nthe highest and most perfect object of their powers in the Divine\nSource of their being, since God is the First or Highest Truth and the\nFirst or Chief Good. Accordingly, intellectual creatures have God as\ntheir ultimate object, whereas all creatures have God as their Cause.\nConsequently, intellectual creatures show themselves to be\n“images” and “likenesses” of God, while they\nshow that all creatures are “shadows” and\n“vestiges” of God. \n\nBonaventure traces out how intellectual creatures and intelligible\nobjects reflect the divine Source. If we begin with something as\nimmediate and basic as simple apprehension on the part of the human\nintellect, we find that an object of simple apprehension (such as the\nnatural kind “dog”) is susceptible of definition. Yet\nevery definition requires a genus and a differentia. Through the\ngeneric term we are led to a further object of simple apprehension,\nusually itself susceptible of definition. If the genus is definable,\nwe may state its definition, but we shall eventually find ourselves\nthrough continuing the process of definition arriving similarly at one\nof the supreme general or Aristotelian categories; if the genus is not\ndefinable, then we have arrived at one of the Aristotelian\ncategories. Once we arrive at a category, we confront an item not\nsusceptible of further definition, though it admits of description. If\nthe categorical item is an accident, it satisfies the description of\nan accident as ‘being through another;’ if we are dealing\nwith substance, then the item we are considering satisfies the\ndescription of substance as ‘being in itself’. \n\nThe resolution of all our items of simple apprehension into the\nconcept of being is metaphysically and epistemologically crucial:\nmetaphysically, it opens up a route of argumentation that leads to the\nexistence of God; epistemologically, such a resolution means that\nbehind all, even the most determinate and specific, conceptions of\nthings lies a transcendental awareness of being that informs all of\nour knowledge. If we take the concept of substance as being in itself,\nwe cannot come to know a particular substance’s definition without the\nconcept of being presupposed in the background, and in addition we are\nconcomitantly aware of the transcendental properties of being (unity,\ntruth, and goodness) in any such notion. Such co-extensive\ntranscendental properties, however, are only one of the two types of\nproperties that belong to being; the other transcendental properties\n(later called disjunctive properties) prove extremely useful for\nincreasing our metaphysical knowledge. Being may be conceived of as\neither actual or potential, absolute or dependent, prior or posterior,\nimmutable or mutable. Yet to conceive of being as potential,\ndependent, posterior, or mutable requires that we already be\nacquainted with being as actual, independent, prior and immutable. In\nother words, the more perfect of the two disjuncts in any of the\ndisjunctive transcendentals must be an item we acknowledge in our\nawareness of being: \n\nAt one level, this line of argumentation is part of an argument for\nthe existence of God. But, at another level, it is an effort to\ndemarcate the proper object of the human mind as being and to point\nout that, if we reflect upon the notion of being (ens) in\nterms of its actuality (esse) we are inexorably led to the\nconclusion that there is a Perfect\n Being.[31]\n We reach the same kind of conclusion if we reflect, not upon the\nprimary object of the mind, but upon its operations. The certainty of\njudgment requires that we be aware of the impossibility of our being\nmistaken combined with our awareness that the truth that we know\ncannot be otherwise; indeed, the most fundamental truths we know are\nall immutable. But, following Augustine, Bonaventure claims that there\nis no source for immutable truth other than God, since God is the only\nimmutable and unchanging\n Being.[32] \n\nWhat we find when we look within ourselves is that we are pointed\nabove to God, who is the light of the mind, guaranteeing the certainty\nof our judgments. This thesis, usually called by scholars divine\nillumination, was quite ancient by Bonaventure’s time; it was part of\nthe philosophical teaching of Augustine. What makes Bonaventure’s\nversion so philosophically distinctive is that he proposes to\nsynthesize the epistemology of divine illumination with the\nAristotelian account of abstraction. Bonaventure is thoroughly\ncommitted to the integral role played by the agent and possible\nintellects in human intellectual cognition. The agent and possible\nintellects are not separated substances, in the way envisaged by\nAverroes, but properly human faculties essential to the constitution\nof the human soul.\n [33]\n Hence, unlike his contemporaries, who often thought of the human\npossible intellect as being illumined by God functioning as an agent\nintellect, Bonaventure assigns each human being an agent\nintellect. Differing from other of his contemporaries, Bonaventure\nalso insists that the possible intellect always remains the recipient\nof the intelligible species abstracted by the agent intellect and the\nfaculty of apprehension; accordingly, the possible intellect continues\nto be part of the human soul even when the soul is separated by death\nfrom the\n body.[34]\n Abstraction is, for Bonaventure, the source of our concepts of\nthings. How then does illumination work and why is it necessary? The\ndivine light works together with the human intellectual faculties as a\n“regulative and moving cause,” ensuring that the human\nmind grasps the immutable truth of the creature; it does not and\ncannot replace the human intellectual faculties in their proper\n roles.[35]\n The appeal to divine illumination is justified, primarily if not\nexclusively, for the reason that there is an incommensurability\nbetween our intellectual faculties and the ordinary objects we know as\ncreated and mutable, on the one hand, and the immutable truths we come\nto know. Inasmuch as things cannot give what they do not have, the\nonly source of eternal and immutable truth is God’s Light. \n\nIn general, the activities proper to intellectual creatures point much\nmore directly than merely sensible or sentient creatures to the divine\nSource. Both the objects of the understanding and the will are\nultimately rooted in God as Being and Goodness. This more direct\npointing to God on the part of the intellectual creature is also seen\nin the intellectual creature’s constitution, both psychological and\nontological. The image of God is found in the fundamental\ninterrelatedness of the memory, understanding, and will. Each act of\nmemory calls to mind the past, is aware of the present and anticipates\nthe future; each act of understanding presupposes the memory of first\nprinciples; and each act of will presupposes the act of understanding\nand moves the mind to further acts of memory. This triadic structure\nof the human mind reflects its Source: the Perfect Being that is\nsimultaneously, Highest Unity, Supreme Truth, and Ultimate\n Good.[36]\n Likewise, the ontological constitution of intellectual creatures,\nhumans and angels, moves us along the road to the consideration of\nGod. Each intellectual creature is composed of act and potency,\nmetaphysical principles that Bonaventure understands to be\nco-extensive with matter and\n form.[37]\n Accordingly, even intellectual creatures are composed of form and\n matter.[38]\n For Bonaventure, it is the conjunction of form and matter that\nexplains the individuality of each\n thing.[39]\n But that even the highest creatures are composed of potency and act\nin this fashion entails that they are derived from a Source that is\nnot so composed, but is, instead, pure act and hence pure form. \n\nIn his Collations on the Hexameron Bonaventure read\nGenesis spiritually, distinguishing seven levels of\n“vision” corresponding to the seven days of creation. The\nfirst level is “understanding naturally given” or\nphilosophy, which he divided following the Stoics into logic, ethics,\nand physics, the last further subdivided following Aristotle into\nnatural philosophy, mathematics, and metaphysics. The focus of\nmetaphysics is on causal relations between God and creatures. Here\n“the philosophers—the finest and the ancient\nphilosophers—came to this conclusion: there is a beginning, and\nan end, and an exemplar cause” of the\n universe,[40]\n that is, God is the efficient, final, and formal cause of the\nworld. Since efficient causality connects metaphysics to physics and\nfinal causality connects it with ethics, the “true\nmetaphysician” focuses on exemplar\n causality,[41]\n a kind of formal causality which is the grand theme of Bonaventurean\nmetaphysics. \n\nTo pursue this theme, Bonaventure made use of materials drawn from\nearlier philosophers about three important points: the\ntranscendentals, the three Neoplatonic routes to God, and the\ndifference between scientific principles and conclusions. About the\ntranscendentals, Aristotle made metaphysics the science of\nsubstance. Centuries later, Avicenna transformed it into a science\ntruly universal in scope by insisting that it study the nine\naccidents, as well as substance, and also the attributes that\ntranscend the categories (Avicenna, Metaphysica, 1.5, 8).\nPhilip the Chancellor codified this doctrine into four\ntranscendentals—being, one, true, and good (Aertsen 1996,\n25–70).  Bonaventure opens consideration of God in his Commentary\non the Sentences by noting that the categorical attributes of\nbeing are “its special properties which characterize its\nimperfection,” but the transcendentals are “its\ngeneral conditions which characterize its\n perfection.”[42]\n The transcendentals therefore set the terms for treating God. \n\nWhen he read “the books of the Platonists,” Augustine\nopened up three routes to proving the existence of God, though he\nhimself explored only one. Arguments like Aristotle’s that begin in\nthe world must proceed from effect to cause and have been called\ncosmological arguments, though\naitiological—meaning simply an argument uncovering\ncauses—seems a better description. When Augustine\nturned within his mind he opened up two other routes to God. The\nsecond route also proceeds from effect to cause, but starts within the\nmind and searches out God as the ultimate cause of the mind’s\nknowledge.  This is the illumination argument for\nGod. Augustine’s turn inward also opened up a third route, later given\nby Kant the unhappy name of ontological argument. The fullest\ndevelopment of this neoplatonic approach to God stood ready to be\nrealized, when all three routes, the aitiological, illuminationist,\nand ontological, would be scouted out by one and the same\nphilosophical mind. That mind was not Augustine’s or Anselm’s but\nBonaventure’s. \n\nIf the transcendentals came primarily from Muslim Aristotelians,\nespecially Avicenna, and the three routes to God were opened by\nAugustine, the last set of materials Bonaventure used to construct his\narguments for the existence of God came from Aristotle himself.\n“Science” consists in knowledge of a limited subject\nachieved through demonstrating conclusions about it based on\nun-demonstrated principles. Bonaventure was one of a group of Parisian\ntheologians, including the Dominicans Albert and Thomas, who attempted\nto set up Christian theology as an Aristotelian science. He therefore\napproached the issue of the existence of God with a sharp distinction\nbetween principles and conclusions in mind. The question he asks is\nnot “Does God exist?” but “Is the divine being so\ntrue that it cannot be thought not to be?” This Anselmian\nformulation offers two options: God’s existence is either a principle\nor a demonstrated conclusion. Philosophers are inclined to pick one\nroute to God and reject all others, but Bonaventure had learned from\nFrancis, the poor man of Assisi, that the world is filled with signs\nof God that even the simplest peasant can grasp. Bonaventure’s\nresponse to the problem of the existence of God was therefore most\nunusual. He pursued all three routes to God; and he even ranked them:\nIllumination arguments make us “certain” of God’s\nexistence; aitiological arguments give us “more certain”\nknowledge of God’s existence; while ontological arguments show that\nGod’s existence is “a truth that is most certain in itself, in\nas far as it is the first and most immediate\n truth.”[43]\nLet us look at each of them in turn. \n\nThe transcendental that initially opens up arguments for the existence\nof God is “truth.” Bonaventure bases his illumination\nargument on the epistemological sense of truth, inspired by\nAugustine’s memorable description of his own inward route to God: \n\nIn his Commentary on the Sentences, Bonaventure extracted\nfrom Augustine’s stirring rhetoric the logical core of the\nillumination argument, reducing it to plain and dispassionate\nsyllogisms, as he had learned from his teachers in Arts at Paris: \n\nBonaventure understood that the step from a true proposition to divine\ntruth is a large one, so he advocates a moderate illuminationist\nposition, one that depends on both divine and created causes.\nBonaventure’s Augustinian illumination theory avoids the problems of\nPlatonism, which turns knowing the world into knowing God, and the\nproblems of Muslim illuminationism, which thought a creature could do\nwhat it takes the infinite mind of God to\n accomplish.[45]\n “For certain knowledge, eternal reason is\nnecessarily involved as a regulative and motive cause, however, not as\nthe sole cause or in its full clarity, but along with a created\ncause and as contuited by us ‘in part’ in accord with\nour present state of\n life.”[46] \n\nTo explain the contribution of the “created” causes of\nknowledge, Bonaventure noted that the content of human\nknowledge comes from four kinds of “created” causes: the\npassive intellect within the individual soul as material\ncause, for it receives knowledge; the individual agent intellect as\nefficient cause, for it abstracts the content of knowledge\nfrom sensation; the essence of an individual creature known as\nformal cause, for the creature is “what” we know;\nand epistemological truth as end. These “proper\nprinciples” of knowledge do not involve\n God.[47] \n\nAbove and beyond these “created” causes, knowledge also\nrequires an “eternal” cause. In the mental acts of\nabstracting universals and arguing inductively, the human mind\ngeneralizes well beyond the data of our experience. It is one thing to\nbe able to generalize so, quite another to be sure one has succeeded.\nIntuition into the essence of a creature involves truths that are not\nonly universal, but also necessary and certain. God is acquainted with\nthe full extension of any universal, since the divine idea of any\ntruth consists in knowledge of that truth in absolutely all its\nactual and possible instantiations. The infinite extension of\nGod’s knowledge is what makes divine understanding certain, and this\ncertainty in the divine mind is on loan, so to speak, to the human\nmind. “If full knowledge requires recourse to a truth\nwhich is fully immutable and stable, and to a light which is\ncompletely infallible, it is necessary for this sort of knowledge to\nhave recourse to the heavenly art as to light and truth: a light,\nI say, which gives infallibility to the [created] knower, and\na truth which gives immutability to the [created] object of\n knowledge.”[48]\n Here Bonaventure makes more precise Augustine’s “light”\nand “truth.” They are the two sides of certitude, so it is\nthe certainty, and only the certainty, found in human knowledge that\nrequires divine illumination; all other features of human\nknowledge–abstraction, universality, correspondence–come\nfrom created causes. \n\nThe aitiological argument is “more certain,” because it\nbegins with a real effect outside the mind and therefore better fits\nAristotle’s model of demonstration. But Bonaventure does not follow\nAristotle’s argument from motion, because motion falls under the\ncategories. More promising were neoplatonic aitiological arguments\n(Boethius Consolatio philosophiae III 10; Anselm,\nMonologion 1–3), which combine an empirical premise with a\nparticipation premise. This is how Bonaventure packed his aitiological\nargument into a single syllogism: “Every truth and every created\nnature proves and leads to the existence of the divine truth. For if\nthere is being by participation and from another, there must exist a\nbeing due to its own essence and not from\n another.”[49] \n\nFor his empirical premise Bonaventure turns again to truth,\nbut ontological truth. All creatures are true to the extent that they\nactualize the potential perfections of their natures, and they are\nfalse to the extent that they fail to do so, because ontological truth\nis “the indivision of act and potency.” So “in a\ncreature there is indivision combined with difference between\nact and potency.” All creatures are partial\nactualizations of truth. Ontological truth takes us to the heart of\nBonaventurean metaphysics. Aristotle’s definition of prime matter as\npure potency means that everything that contains potency of any sort,\neven an angel, must contain matter. This universal hylomorphism leads\nin turn to Bonaventure’s doctrine of being: “Matter gives\nindependent existence (existere) to form, while form gives\nthe act of being (essendi actum) to\n matter.”[50]\n Every created being (ens) is an ontological composite of\nindependent existence (existere) and being (esse),\nwhere esse signifies the nature or essence of the thing. From\nrocks to angels, all creatures are true to the extent that the\npotencies of their “existence” given by matter are\nrealized through the perfection of their “being” through\nform. \n\nThe participation premise moves from effect to cause within\nthe line of formal causality. A necessary condition for the existence\nof any attribute by participation is that the same attribute\nis present in its exemplar essentially, that is,\nintrinsically. Participation does not immediately take us to God, but\ninitially describes relations between creatures. A statue or computer\ncan have certain human attributes–shape, color, size,\ncomputational skill–but only because these features are caused\nby the artisan who made it. This is how participation works within\nthe created order. It is transcendenal “truth” that\nmoves the argument beyond creatures to God. If incomplete realization\nof an intrinsically imperfect categorical attribute–like white\nor horse or dirt–implies that those attributes must also exist\nin some other creature “essentially,” then transcendental\nattributes should behave the same way. But no creature could be such\nan exemplar. The exemplar for ontological truth must therefore be God,\nwho perfectly realizes his own essence, which is to say that God is\ntrue “essentially.” In On the Mystery of the\nTrinity, Bonaventure expands this line of argument further in the\ndirection of the transcendentals. There he identifies nine more\ndisjunctive transcendentals, in addition to the pair “by\nparticipation” and “essentially,” where the lesser\nimplies the existence of the\n greater.[51] \n\nJust as his illumination argument uncovered God as a kind of formal\nand efficient cause of certitude, so Bonaventure’s aitiological\nargument uncovers God as formal cause of truth in creatures. But in\naddition it ends just where his ontological argument begins. For what\ndoes an ontological argument do but peer into the inner logic of such\nan exemplar essence and try to capture the logical consequence that it\nmust exist? \n\nBonaventure was the first thirteenth-century thinker to pay serious\nattention to the ontological argument. He read the Proslogion\nof Anselm through Aristotelian lenses. Now Aristotle had recognized\nthree different kinds of scientific principles: common axioms\ngoverning all thought, so well known that no one can deny them, and\nproper principles limited in range to a given science–its\ndefinitions and postulates. Anselm seemed to mean that God’s existence\nis an axiom of thought known by all humans, and Bonaventure agrees:\n“since our intellect is never deficient in knowing about God\nif it is, so it cannot be ignorant of God’s existence,\nabsolutely speaking, nor even think God does not\n exist.”[52] \n\nWhile Anselm thought this conclusion rules out even the possibility of\natheism, Bonaventure more realistically shows how atheism is\npossible. The problem is with our defective knowledge of God’s\nnature. Error there can lead by logical inference to the\nconclusion that God does not exist in the first place. We are\nspontaneously theists, but can convince ourselves to become atheists.\nInadequate definition of God points to a second problem. Knowing God\nexists is similar to knowing axioms because both are recognized by\nall.  The difference is that we are quite certain “the whole is\ngreater than the part,” because the terms involved in this axiom\nare so familiar to us; but about God’s existence we have more an\nopinion than certain knowledge, because we lack an adequate definition\nof God’s nature. \n\nThere are two remedies for the defects in our knowledge of\n“what” God is, one taken from faith, the other from\nreason.  Both make knowledge of God’s existence more like a postulate\nknown with certitude by the “wise” than like an axiom\nrecognized by “all” humans (Boethius, De\nhebdomadibus, 40).  For Christian belief and for theology, God’s\nexistence is an article of faith. The other remedy is Bonaventure’s\nadaptation of Anselm’s argument conceived as a philosophical argument\non behalf of a metaphysical postulate. \n\nBonaventure’s ontological argument contains two moments, so to speak,\none negative, the other positive. Negatively, Bonaventure’s\nontological argument proceeds as a reduction to absurdity of the\natheistic proposition. Anselm had taken a peculiar description of God,\n“something than which a greater cannot be thought,” which\nAugustine had used to argue through a reductio ad absurdum to\nthe conclusion that God must be incorruptible, and Boethius used to\nargue that God must be good, and he had used it to argue by\nreductio that God must exist in the first place. Bonaventure\nrecognized the affinity with arguing by reductio in support\nof the principle of non-contradiction: \n\nBut his study of Aristotelian philosophy made Bonaventure more\nsensitive than Anselm to the limitations of reductio\narguments. Positive insight into principles is more than negative\nreductio leading up to principles, so snaring the atheist in\na contradiction is still one step away from affirming that God\nexists. To make this step intelligible he emended the ontological\nargument in a positive direction. \n\nBonaventure therefore explains what makes a proposition\n“self-evident,” which in turn opens the way for deducing\nGod’s existence out of God’s essence. \n\nPrinciples are “self-evident” (cf. Aristotle,\nTopics, 100a31–b21).  In the second of Aristotle’s\nmodes of per se (Aristotle, Posterior Analytics\n73a34–b3), the essence of the subject causes the\npredicate. This provided Bonaventure with an ingenious explanation of\nwhy principles are self-evident: “We know principles to the\nextent that we understand the terms which make them up, because the\ncause of the predicate is included in the subject.” If\nthe essence of the subject term is what connects it to the predicate\nterm in a self-evident proposition, then the essence of God must be\nwhat makes “God exists” self-evident. The positive\nontological argument contains an inference to the existence of God\nthat runs through the divine essence. \n\nMost descriptions of the divine essence are inappropriate for the\nontological argument, but the transcendentals are the right terms\nbecause they do not imply imperfection, can be predicated\nnon-metaphorically of God, and are primordial, the “first\nnotions falling into the\n mind.”[54]All more specific concepts presuppose transcendental\nnotions, and Anselm’s own formula was no exception to this rule. In\nhis Commentary on the Sentences Bonaventure used the\ntranscendental “true” as the middle term of his positive\nontological argument; in the disputed question On the Mystery of\nthe Trinity he used “good,” and in the Journey of\nthe Mind to God he used “being.” \n\nIn the Commentary, Bonaventure introduces his arguments for\nGod’s existence with an elaborate treatment of truth. As a relation,\ntruth always involves a comparison. Epistemological truth is an\n“indivision” between the human mind and the thing known.\nOntological truth is an “indivision” between potency and\nact within a creature; the more it fulfills its nature, the truer it\nis. These two senses of truth open up a comparison of creature as\nparticipant to God as exemplar. All three, epistemological,\nontological, participationist truths, are imperfect, combinations of\ntruth and falsity. They point to their exemplar, the one\n“pure” truth, present only in God, where there is\n“pure indivision mixed with no\n diversity.”[55]\n This last sense of truth Bonaventure uses in his ontological\nargument: \n\nBonaventure includes the negative reasoning so prominent in Anselm’s\nversion, but to Anselm’s formula he adds “being itself”\nand “the highest truth.” While each of these three\ndescriptions casts a different light on why the inference to God’s\nexistence is valid, Bonaventure here seems to prefer “the\nhighest truth” because the definition of truth as\n“indivision” is the basis for re-conceiving the\nontological argument as establishing an “indivision”\nbetween the middle term and the predicate “exists.” If the\n“highest truth” is “pure indivision,” then the\nhighest truth cannot be divided off from existence. \n\nIn On the Mystery of the Trinity, Bonaventure changes the\nfocus of the ontological argument to goodness, with a memorable\nresult.  The basic notion of goodness is not by itself sufficient to\nmount an ontological argument, but analysis of goodness uncovers the\nrelevant terms: \n\nThe logic of “the best” (optimum) is different\nfrom the logic of “the good.” Since goodness completes or\nperfects something, “the best” must be “a being\nwhich is fully complete (ens completissimum).” Now what\nis absolutely complete must possess all possible perfections. But\nexistence is not just a perfection, one component among many\nmaking up such ontological completeness, it is the most\nfundamental feature of such completeness. Consequently, such an\nabsolutely perfect being must exist. Bonaventure’s argument runs from\nthe subject “God,” through the middle terms “the\nbest” and “absolutely complete being,” to the\npredicate “exists.” In the shorter and even more memorable\nformulation, “If God is God, God is,” the premise If\nGod is God is not an empty tautology (Seifert 1992, 216–217).  It\nmeans ‘if the entity to which the term God refers truly\npossesses the divine essence.’ And the conclusion means that\nsuch an entity must exist. \n\nBonaventure was well aware of criticisms of the ontological argument,\nbeginning with Gaunilo’s retort that the greatest of all possible\nislands should also really exist. His reply is more effective than\nAnselm’s because it uses the transcendentals. An island is an\ninherently imperfect being (ens defectivum) because\ncategorical; but ens completissimum is not because a\n transcendental.[58] \n\nIn The Journey of the Mind to God, c. 5, Bonaventure focuses\nthe ontological argument on “being” and develops it far\nbeyond anything he had previously done. He qualifies esse in\ntwo different ways, creating two different middle terms: “divine\nbeing” (esse divinum) and “completely pure being\n(esse purissimum).” First he uses “completely\npure being” to deduce the predicate “exists,” then\nuses “divine being” to ensure that it is God who\nis so proven to exist. In this way the basic steps of this argument\nclosely parallel those of the argument based on goodness: ‘God\n(Deus) who is divine being (esse divinum) is also\nseen to be completely pure being (esse purissimum) and\ntherefore must exist (est).’ \n\nBonaventure\n begins[59]\n by repeating the essentials of the earlier versions of the argument,\nbut then moves well beyond them: \n\nIf “being itself” (ipsum esse) distinguishes the\nbeing (esse) of a creature from its independent existence\n(existere), adding the superlative completely pure\nto being itself (esse purissimum) refers to the\nnotion of an essence that does not involve non-being in\nany way: a completely pure or perfect essence. The notion of\nesse purissimum does not presuppose the real existence of\nGod; rather, it implies that real existence. But at this point this\ninference may not yet be clear, so Bonaventure devotes the rest of\nthis short text to showing why the notion of completely pure being\nitself actually entails the real existence of God. \n\nIn contrast with creatures, which are mid-level on the scale of being\nbecause they are open to existence and non-existence, the notions of\ncomplete nothingness (omnino nihil) and completely pure being\n(esse purissimum) have absolutely opposed implications for\nexistence. “Complete nothing-ness” is logically\ninconsistent with real existence, so there is a perfectly valid\ninference from the notion of nothing to non-being\n(non-esse). Nothing cannot exist. If the nature of nothing\nentails its non-existence, the nature of its opposite, completely\npure being, entails its real existence. Making use of the\ncategories of his own metaphysics in this way shows more effectively\nthan merely backing the mind into a contradiction why the ontological\ninference is valid. \n\nThe basis for the argument thus far is a notion, not of God but of an\nessence, completely pure, of non-being. One might ask where\nBonaventure acquires this notion, seemingly drawn from thin air. His\nreply is that conceptual analysis of the first of all notions,\ntranscendental being (ens), reveals this purely metaphysical\nnotion. \n\nHere Bonaventure peers into the notion of “a being”\n(ens) and finds it has two component principles: independent\nexistence (existere), which gives the being the potential to\nhave a certain essence; and being (esse), the actuality of\nsuch an essence. It is esse rather than existere\nwhich “denominates the pure actuality of a being.” Here\n“actuality” (actus) means ‘that which makes\nthe being actually intelligible, by giving it the actual essence it\nhas.’ This movement of conceptual analysis opens the\nmind to see that we can understand a creature as “a being”\n(ens) only by referring to the notion of an act of being\nwhich is pure from non-being (esse purum), indeed, which is\npure from any non-being (esse purissimum). Implicit\nwithin the very notion of transcendental “being”\nand a presupposition of our understanding the notion of\ntranscendental being, is the notion of being with no hint of\nnon-being (esse purissimum). Even if only implicit, this\nnotion must be present in the mind of anyone who understands being\n(ens), that is, everyone who understands anything at all. \n\nOnce it has been shown that esse purissimum is a notion which\nimplies real existence and that we all possess this notion as a\ncomponent of the fundamental notion of a being (ens), it\nremains only to identify esse purissimum with God. \n\nIf esse purissimum really exists, as has been proven, it must\nexist in one of three modes. But since particular and intentional\nbeing cannot be completely perfect, esse purissimum must be\nidentical with the divine being. \n\nThe real but initially hidden starting point for Bonaventure’s\nontological argument in the Journey is the notion of\nesse purissimum, taken not subjectively as existing as a\nconcept in a human mind, but in its objective\n meaning,[63]\n that is, as signifying a certain kind of quiddity or essence. The\nachievement of the ontological argument, as Bonaventure saw it, is\ntwofold: it shows that this essence must really exist, and it shows\nthat this essence is none other than God. \n\nBonaventure locates knowledge of God’s existence within all three\nparts of an Aristotelian science–as demonstrated conclusion, as\ncommon axiom, and as proper postulate. It can be proven through two\nkinds of demonstrations of the fact, by an illumination argument\nstarting inside the mind and an aitiological argument starting\noutside. Such proofs proceed from created truth as a vestige\nto the one God as its cause. But “God exists” is\nalso a principle recognized by virtually all humans, a kind of axiom\nbuilt upon creatures conceived as shadows of the one\ndivinity for whom explicit arguments specifying God’s causality are no\nmore needed than for other axioms. Finally, there are two ways God’s\nexistence is known as a postulate: first, through the ontological\nargument, where the transcendental attributes found in creatures\nfunction as vestiges providing the mind the notions it uses\nin the argument for the one God’s existence; and second, as\nan article of faith. Here faith is postulated on the authority of\nrevelation and is certain, but its certainty comes from God, not human\nreason. And here, too, features of intellectual creatures, especially\nhumans, function as images and likenesses of the\nTrinitarian God. Knowledge of God’s existence, in sum, is\nubiquitous.
