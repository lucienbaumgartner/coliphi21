Paradigmatic\nexamples of such entities are electrons, neutrinos, gravitational\nforces, genes etc. There is yet another explanation of theoreticity: a\ntheoretical term is one whose meaning becomes determined through the\naxioms of a scientific theory. The meaning of the term\n‘force’, for example, is seen to be determined by\nNewton’s laws of motion and further laws about special forces,\nsuch as the law of gravitation. Theoreticity is a property that is\ncommonly applied to both expressions in the language of science, and\nreferents and concepts of such expressions. Objects, relations and\nfunctions as well as concepts thereof may thus qualify as theoretical\nin a derived sense.\n\n\nSeveral semantics have been devised that aim to explain how a\nscientific theory contributes to the interpretation of its theoretical\nterms and as such determines what they mean and how they are\nunderstood. All of these semantics assume the respective theory to be\ngiven in an axiomatic fashion. Yet, theoretical terms are also\nrecognizable in scientific theories which have as yet resisted a\nsatisfying axiomatization. This is due to the fact that these theories\ncontain general propositions that have the logical form of universal\naxioms. \n\n\nTheoretical terms pertain to a number of topics in the philosophy of\nscience. A fully fledged semantics of such terms commonly involves a\nstatement about scientific realism and its alternatives. Such a\nsemantics, moreover, may involve an account of how observation is\nrelated to theory in science. All formal accounts of theoretical terms\ndeny the analytic-synthetic distinction to be applicable to the axioms\nof a scientific theory. The recognition of theoretical terms in the\nlanguage of science by Carnap thus amounts to a rejection of an\nessential tenet of early logical empiricism and positivism, viz., the\ndemonstration that all empirically significant sentences are\ntranslatable into an observation language. The present article\nexplains the principal distinction between observational and\ntheoretical terms, discusses important criticisms and refinements of\nthis distinction and investigates two problems concerning the\nsemantics of theoretical terms. Finally, the major formal accounts of\nthis semantics are expounded. \n\nAs just explained, a theoretical term may simply be understood as an\nexpression that refers to nonobservable entities or properties.\nTheoreticity, on this understanding, is the negation of observabilty.\nThis explanation of theoreticity thus rests on an antecedent\nunderstanding of observability. What makes an entity or property\nobservable? As Carnap (1966: ch. 23) has pointed out, a philosopher\nunderstands the notion of observability in a narrower sense than a\nphysicist. For a philosopher, a property is observable if it can be\n‘directly perceived by the senses’. Hence, such properties\nas ‘blue’, ‘hard’ and ‘colder\nthan’ are paradigmatic examples of observable properties in the\nphilosopher’s understanding of observability. The physicist, by\ncontrast, would also count quantitative magnitudes that can be\nmeasured in a ‘relatively simple, direct way’ as\nobservable. Hence, the physicist views such quantities as temperature,\npressure and intensity of electric current as observable.  \nThe notion of direct perception is spelled out by Carnap (1966: ch.\n23) by two conditions. Direct perception means, first, perception\nunaided by technical instruments and, second, that the perception is\nunaided by inferences. These two conditions are obviously not\nsatisfied for the measurement of quantities like temperature and\npressure. For the philosopher, only spatial positions of liquids and\npointers are observed when these quantities are measured. To an even\nhigher degree, we are unable to observe electrons, molecules,\ngravitational forces and genes on this narrow understanding of\nobservability. Hence, expressions referring to such entities qualify\nas theoretical.  \nIn sum, a property or object is observable (in the philosopher’s\nsense) if it can be perceived directly, where directness of\nobservation precludes the use of technical artifacts and inferences.\nNotably, Carnap (1936/37: 455; 1966: 226) did not think his\nexplanation of the distinction to be sufficiently precise to result in\na sharp line between observational and theoretical terms. He rather\nviews the theory-observation distinction as being introduced into a\n‘continuum of degrees of observability’ by choice.\nProminent criticisms of the theory-observation distinction will be\ndiscussed in\n Section 2.1.\n  \nThe above explanation of theoreticity may be felt unsatisfactory as it\ndetermines the property of being theoretical only via negation of the\nproperty of being observable (Putnam 1962). This explanation does not\nindicate any specific connection between the semantics of theoretical\nterms and corresponding scientific theories. There is, however, also a\ndirect characterization of theoreticity that complements the criterion\nof non-observability: an expression is theoretical if and only if its\nmeaning is determined through the axioms of a scientific theory. This\nexplanation rests on what has come to be referred to as the\ncontextual theory of meaning, which says that the meaning of\na scientific term depends, in some way or other, on how this term is\nincorporated into a scientific theory.  \nWhy adopt the contextual theory of meaning for scientific terms?\nSuppose the notion of meaning is understood along the lines of the\nFregean notion of sense. The sense of a term be understood as that\nwhat determines its reference (cf. Church 1956: 6n). It is,\nfurthermore, a reasonable requirement that a semantic theory must\naccount for our understanding of the sense and, hence, our methods of\ndetermining the extension of scientific terms (cf. Dummett 1991: 340).\nFor a large number of scientific terms these methods rest upon axioms\nof one or more scientific theories. There is no way of determining the\nforce function in classical mechanics without using some axiom of this\ntheory. Familiar methods make use of Newton’s second law of\nmotion, Hooke’s law, the law of gravitation etc. Likewise,\nvirtually all methods of measuring temperature rest upon laws of\nthermodynamics. Take measurement by a gas thermometer which is based\non the ideal gas law. The laws of scientific theories are thus\nessential to our methods of determining the extension of scientific\nterms. The contextual theory of meaning, therefore, makes intelligible\nhow students in a scientific discipline and scientists grasp the\nmeaning, or sense, of scientific terms. On this account, understanding\nthe sense of a term means knowing how to determine its referent, or\nextension, at least in part.  \nThe contextual theory of meaning can be traced back at least to the\nwork of Duhem. His demonstration that a scientific hypothesis in\nphysics cannot be tested in isolation from its theoretical context is\njoined with and motivated by semantic considerations, according to\nwhich it is physical theories that give meaning to the specific\nconcepts of physics (Duhem 1906: 183). Poincaré (1902: 90)\nliterally claims that certain scientific propositions acquire meaning\nonly by virtue of the adoption of certain conventions. Perhaps the\nmost prominent and explicit formulation of the contextual theory of\nmeaning is to be found in Feyerabend’s landmark\n“Explanation, Reduction, and Empiricism” (1962: 88):  \nFor just as the meaning of a term is not an intrinsic property but is\ndependent upon the way in which the term has been incorporated into a\ntheory, in the very same manner the content of a whole theory (and\nthereby again the meaning of the descriptive terms which it contains)\ndepends upon the way in which it is incorporated into both the set of\nits empirical consequences and the set of all the alternatives which\nare being discussed at a given time: once the contextual theory of\nmeaning has been adopted, there is no reason to confine its\napplication to a single theory, especially as the boundaries of such a\nlanguage or of such a theory are almost never well defined. \nThe accounts of a contextual theory of meaning in the works of Duhem,\nPoincaré and Feyerabend are informal insofar as they do not\ncrystallize into a corresponding formal semantics for scientific\nterms. Such a crystallization is brought about by some of the formal\naccounts of theoretical terms to be expounded in\n Section 4.\n  \nThe view that meaning is bestowed upon a theoretical term through the\naxioms of a scientific theory implies that only axiomatized or\naxiomatizable scientific theories contain theoretical terms. In fact,\nall formal accounts of the semantics of theoretical terms are devised\nto apply to axiomatic scientific theories. This is due, in part, to\nthe fact that physics has dominated the philosophy of science for a\nlong time. One must wonder, therefore, whether there are any\ntheoretical terms in, for example, evolutionary biology which has as\nyet resisted complete axiomatization. Arguably, there are. Even though\nevolutionary biology has not yet been axiomatized, we can recognize\ngeneral propositions therein that are essential to determining certain\nconcepts of this theory. Consider the following two propositions. (i)\nTwo DNA sequences are homologous if and only if they have a common\nancestor sequence. (ii) There is an inverse correlation between the\nnumber of mutations necessary to transform one DNA-sequence \\(S_1\\)\ninto another \\(S_2\\) and the likelihood that \\(S_1\\) and \\(S_2\\) are\nhomologous. Notably, these two propositions are used to determine,\namong other methods, relations of homology in evolutionary biology.\nThe majority of general propositions in scientific theories other than\nthose of physics, however, have instances that fail to be true. (Some\nphilosophers of science have argued that this so even for a large\nnumber of axioms in physics [Cartwright 1983]). Formal semantics of\ntheoretical terms in scientific theories with default axioms are\npresently being developed.  \nThe very idea of a clear-cut theory-observation distinction has\nreceived much criticism. First, with the help of sophisticated\ninstruments, such as telescopes and electron microscopes, we are able\nto observe more and more entities, which had to be considered\nunobservable at a previous stage of scientific and technical\nevolution. Electrons and \\(\\alpha\\)-particles which can be observed in\na cloud chamber are a case in point (Achinstein 1965). Second, assume\nobservability is understood as excluding the use of instruments. On\nthis understanding, examples drawing on the use of cloud chambers and\nelectron microscopes, which are adduced to criticize the\ntheory-observation distinction, can be dealt with. However, we would\nthen have to conclude that things being perceived with glasses are not\nobserved either, which is counterintuitive (Maxwell 1962). Third,\nthere are concepts applying to or being thought to apply to both\nmacroscopic and submicroscopic particles. A case in point are spatial\nand temporal relations and the color concepts that play an important\nrole in Newton’s corpuscle theory of light. Hence, there are\nclear-cut instances of observation concepts that apply to unobservable\nentities, which does not seem acceptable (cf. Putnam 1962).  \nThese objections to the theory-observation distinction can be answered\nin a relatively straightforward manner from a Carnapian perspective.\nAs explained in\n Section 1.1,\n Carnap (1936/37, 1966) was quite explicit that the\nphilosopher’s sense of observation excludes the use of\ninstruments. As for an observer wearing glasses, a proponent of the\ntheory-observation distinction finds enough material in Carnap\n(1936/37: 455) to defend her position. Carnap is aware of the fact\nthat color concepts are not observable ones for a color-blind person.\nHe is thus prepared to relativize the distinction in question. In\nfact, Carnap’s most explicit explanation of observability\ndefines this notion in such a way that it is relativized to an\norganism (1936/37: 454n).  \nRecall, moreover, that Carnap’s theory-observation distinction\nwas not intended to do justice to our overall understanding of these\nnotions. Hence, certain quotidian and scientific uses of\n‘observation’, such as observation using glasses, may well\nbe disregarded when this distinction is drawn as long as the\ndistinction promises to be fruitful in the logical analysis of\nscientific theories. A closer look reveals that Carnap (1966: 226)\nagrees with critics of the logical empiricists’ agenda, such as\nMaxwell (1962) and Achinstein (1965), on there being no clear-cut\ntheory-observation distinction (see also Carnap’s early\n(1936/37: 455) for a similar statement):  \nThere is no question here of who [the physicist thinking that\ntemperature is observable or the philosopher who disagrees, H. A.] is\nusing the term ‘observable’ in the right or proper way.\nThere is a continuum which starts with direct sensory observations and\nproceeds to enormously complex, indirect methods of observation.\nObviously no sharp line can be drawn across this continuum; it is a\nmatter of degree. \nA bit more serious is Putnam’s (1962) objection drawing on the\napplication of apparently clear-cut instances of observation concepts\nto submicroscopic particles. Here, Carnap would have to distinguish\nbetween color concepts applying to observable entities and related\ncolor concepts applying to unobservable ones. So, the formal language\nin which the logical analysis proceeds would have to contain a\npredicate ‘red\\(_1\\)’ applying to macroscopic objects and\nanother one ‘red\\(_2\\)’ applying to submicroscopic ones.\nAgain, such a move would be in line with the artificial, or ideal\nlanguage philosophy that Carnap proclaimed (see Lutz (2012) for a\nsympathetic discussion of artificial language philosophy.)  \nThere is another group of criticisms coming from the careful study of\nthe history of science: Hanson (1958), Feyerabend (1962) and Kuhn\n(1962) aimed to show that observation concepts are\ntheory-laden in a manner that makes their meaning\ntheory-dependent. In Feyerabend’s (1978: 32) this contention\ntakes on the formulation that all terms are theoretical. Hanson (1958:\n18) thinks that Tycho and Kepler were (literally) ‘seeing’\ndifferent things when perceiving the sun rising because their\nastronomical background theories were different. Kuhn (1962) was more\ntentative when expounding his variant of the theory-ladenness of\nobservation. In a discussion of the Sneed formalism of the\nstructuralist school, he favored a theory-observation distinction that\nis relativized, first to a theory and second to an application of this\ntheory (Kuhn 1976).  \nVirtually all formal accounts of theoretical terms in fact assume that\nthose phenomena that a theory T is meant to account for can be\ndescribed in terms whose semantics does not depend on T. The\ncounter thesis that even the semantics of putative observation terms\ndepends on a quotidian or scientific theory, therefore, attacks a core\ndoctrine coming with the logical empiricists’ and subsequent\nwork on theoretical terms. A thorough discussion and assessment of\ntheory-ladenness of observation in the works of the great historians\nof science is beyond the scope of this entry. Bird (2004), Bogen\n(2012) and Oberheim and Hoyningen-Huene (2009) are entries in the\npresent encyclopedia that address, among other things, this\nissue. Schurz (2013: ch. 2.9) defines a criterion of the theory\nindependence of observation in terms of an ostensive learning\nexperiment, and shows how such a criterion helps answer the challenges\nof theory-ladenness of observation.  \nThere is a simple, intuitive and influential proposal how to\nrelativize the theory-observation distinction in a sensible way: a\nterm t is theoretical with respect to a theory T, or for\nshort, a T-term if and only if it is introduced by the theory\nT at a certain stage in the history of science. O-terms, by\ncontrast, are those that were antecedently available and understood\nbefore T was set forth (Lewis 1970; cf. Hempel 1973). This\nproposal draws the theory-observation distinction in an apparently\nsharp way by means of relativizing that distinction to a particular\ntheory. Needless to say, the proposal is in line with the contextual\ntheory of meaning.  \nThe distinction between T-terms and antecedently available ones\nhas two particular merits. First, it circumvents the view that any\nsharp line between theoretical and observational terms is conventional\nand arbitrary. Second, it connects the theory-observation distinction\nwith what seemed to have motivated that distinction in the first\nplace, viz., the investigation how we come to understand the meaning\nof terms that appear to be meaningful in virtue of certain scientific\ntheories.  \nA similar proposal of a relativized theory-observation distinction was\nmade by Sneed in his seminal The Logical Structure of Mathematical\nPhysics (1979: ch. II). Here is a somewhat simplified and more\nsyntactic formulation of Sneed’s criterion of\nT-theoreticity:  \nDefinition 1 (T-theoreticity) \n\nA term t is theoretical with respect to the theory T, or\nfor short, T-theoretical if and only if any method of\ndetermining the extension of t, or some part of that extension,\nrests on some axiom of T. \nIt remains to explain what it is for a method \\(m\\) of determining the\nextension of t to rest upon an axiom \\(\\phi\\). This relation\nobtains if and only if the use of \\(m\\) depends on \\(\\phi\\) being a\ntrue sentence. In other words, \\(m\\) rests upon \\(\\phi\\) if and only\nif the hypothetical assumption of \\(\\phi\\) being false or\nindeterminate would invalidate the use of \\(m\\) in the sense that we\nwould be lacking the commonly presumed justification for using \\(m\\).\nThe qualification ‘or some part of that extension’ has\nbeen introduced in the present definition because we cannot expect a\nsingle measurement method to determine the extension of a scientific\nquantity completely. T-non-theoreticity is the negation of\nT-theoreticity:  \nDefinition 2 (T-non-theoreticity) \n\nA term t is T-non-theoretical if and only if it is not\nT-theoretical. \nThe concepts of classical particle mechanics (henceforth abbreviated\nby CPM) exemplify well the notions of T-theoreticity and\nT-non-theoreticity. As has been indicated above, all methods of\ndetermining the force acting upon a particle make use of some axiom of\nclassical particle mechanics, such as Newton’s laws of motion or\nsome law about special forces. Hence, force is CPM-theoretical.\nMeasurement of spatial distances, by contrast, is possible without\nusing axioms of CPM. Hence, the concept of spatial distance is\nCPM-non-theoretical. The concept of mass is less straightforward to\nclassify as we can measure this concept using classical collision\nmechanics (CCM). Still, it was seen to be CPM-theoretical by the\nstructuralists since CCM appeared reducible to CPM (Balzer et al.\n1987: ch. 2).  \nSuppose for a term t once introduced by a scientific theory\n\\(T_1\\) novel methods of determination become established through\nanother theory \\(T_2\\), where these methods do not depend on any axiom\nof \\(T_1\\). Then, t would neither qualify as\n\\(T_1\\)-theoretical nor as \\(T_2\\)-theoretical. It is preferable, in\nthis situation, to relativize Definition 1 to theory-nets \\(N\\), i.e.,\ncompounds of several theories. Whether there are such cases has not\nyet been settled.  \nThe original exposition of the theoreticity criterion by Sneed (1979)\nis a bit more involved as it makes use of set-theoretic predicates and\nintended applications, rather technical notions of what became later\non labeled the structuralist approach to scientific theories.\nThere has been a lively discussion, mainly but not exclusively within\nthe structuralist school, how to express the relativized notion of\ntheoreticity most properly (Balzer 1986; 1996). As noted above, Kuhn\n(1976) proposed a twofold relativization of theoreticity, viz., first\nto a scientific theory and second to applications of such theories.\n \nNotably, Sneed’s criterion of T-theoreticity suggests a\nstrategy that allows us to regain a global, non-relativized\ntheory-observation distinction: simply take a term t to be\ntheoretical if and only if it holds, for all methods \\(m\\) of\ndetermining its extension, that \\(m\\) rests upon some axiom of some\ntheory T. A term t is non-theoretical, or observational,\nif and only if there are means of determining its extension, at least\nin part, that do not rest upon any axiom of any theory. This criterion\nis still relative to our present stage of explicit axiomatic\ntheorizing but comes nonetheless closer to the original intention of\nCarnap’s theory-observation distinction, according to which\nobservation is understood in the narrow sense of unaided perception.\n \nThe problem of theoretical terms is a recurrent theme in the\nphilosophy of science literature (Achinstein 1965; Sneed 1979: ch. II;\nTuomela 1973: ch. V; Friedman 2011). Different shades of meaning have\nbeen associated with this problem. In its most comprehensive\nformulation, the problem of theoretical terms is to give a proper\naccount of the meaning and reference of theoretical terms. There are\nat least two kinds of expression that pose a distinct problem of\ntheoretical terms, respectively. First, unary predicates referring to\ntheoretical entities, such as ‘electron’,\n‘neutrino’ and ‘nucleotide’. Second, non-unary\ntheoretical predicates, such as ‘homology’ in evolutionary\nbiology and theoretical function expressions, such as\n‘force’, ‘temperature’ and ‘intensity of\nthe electromagnetic field’ in physics. Sneed’s problem of\ntheoretical terms, as expounded in (1979: ch. II), concerns only the\nlatter kind of expression. We shall now start surveying problems\nconcerning the semantics of expressions for theoretical entities and\nthen move on to expressions for theoretical relations and functions.\n \nA proper semantics for theoretical terms involves an account of\nreference and one of meaning and understanding. Reference fixing needs\nto be related to meaning as we want to answer the following question:\nhow do we come to refer successfully to theoretical entities? This\nquestion calls for different answers depending on what particular\nconception of a theoretical entity is adopted. The issue of realism\nand its alternatives, therefore, comes into play at this point.  \nFor the realist, theoretical entities exist independently from our\ntheories about the world. Also, natural kinds that classify these\nentities exist independently from our theories (cf. Psillos 1999;\nLewis 1984). The instrumentalist picture is commonly reported to\naccount for theoretical entities in terms of mere fictions. The\nformalist variant of instrumentalism denies theoretical terms to have\nreferents at all. Between these two extreme cases there is a number of\nintermediate\n positions.[1] \nCarnap (1958; 1966: ch. 26) attempted to attain a metaphysically\nneutral position so as to avoid a commitment to or denial of\nscientific realism. In his account of the theoretical language of\nscience, theoretical entities were conceived as mathematical ones that\nare related to observable events in certain determinate ways. An\nelectron, for example, figures as a certain distribution of charge and\nmass in a four-dimensional manifold of real numbers, where charge and\nmass are mere real-valued functions. These functions and the\nfour-dimensional manifold itself are to be related to observable\nevents by means of universal axioms. Notably, Carnap would not have\naccepted a characterization of his view as antirealist or non-realist\nsince he thought the metaphysical doctrine of realism to be void of\ncontent.  \nIn sum, there are three major and competing characterizations of a\ntheoretical entity in science that are in line with the common\ntheoreticity criterion according to which such an entity is\ninaccessible by means of unaided perception. First, theoretical\nentities are characterized as mind and language independent. Second,\ntheoretical entities are mind and language dependent in some way or\nother. Third, they are conceived as mathematical entities that are\nrelated to the observable world in certain determinate ways. We may\nthus distinguish between (i) a realist view, (ii) a collection of\nnon-realist views and (iii) a Pythagorean view of theoretical\nentities.  \nNow, there are three major accounts of reference and meaning that have\nbeen used, implicitly or explicitly, for the semantics of theoretical\nterms: (i) the descriptivist picture, (ii) causal and\ncausal-historical theories and (iii) hybrid ones that combine\ndescriptivist ideas with causal elements (Reimer 2010). Accounts of\nreference and meaning other than these play no significant role in the\nphilosophy of science. Hence, we need to survey at least nine\ncombinations consisting, first, of an abstract characterization of the\nnature of a theoretical entity (realist, non-realist and Pythagorean),\nand, second, a particular account of reference (descriptivist, causal\nand hybrid). Some of these combinations are plainly inconsistent and,\nhence, can be dealt with very briefly. Let us start with the realist\nview of theoretical entities.  \nThe descriptivist picture is highly intuitive with regard to our\nunderstanding of expressions referring to theoretical entities on the\nrealist view. According to this picture, an electron is a\nspatiotemporal entity with such and such a mass and such and such a\ncharge. We detect and recognize electrons when identifying entities\nhaving these properties. The descriptivist explanation of meaning and\nreference makes use of theoretical functions, mass and electric charge\nin the present example. The semantics of theoretical entities,\ntherefore, is connected with the semantics of theoretical relations\nand functions, which will be dealt with in the next subsection. It\nseems to hold, in general, that theoretical entities in the sciences\nare to be characterized in terms of theoretical functions and\n(non-unary) relations.  \nThe descriptivist account, however, faces two particular problems with\nregard to the historic evolution of scientific theories. First, if\ndescriptions of theoretical entities are constitutive of the meaning\nof corresponding unary predicates, one must wonder what the common\ncore of understanding is that adherents of successive theories share\nand whether there is such a core at all. Were Rutherford and Bohr\ntalking about the same type of entities when using the expression\n‘electron’? Issues of incommensurability arise with the\ndescriptivist picture (Psillos 1999: 280). A second problem arises\nwhen elements of the description of an entity given by a predecessor\ntheory T are judged wrong from the viewpoint of the successor\ntheory \\(T'\\). Then, on a strict reading of the descriptivist account,\nthe corresponding theoretical term failed to refer in T. For if\nthere is nothing that satisfies a description, the corresponding\nexpression has no referent. This is a simple consequence of the theory\nof description by Russell in his famous “On Denoting”\n(1905). Hence, an account of weighting descriptions is needed in order\nto circumvent such failures of reference.  \nAs is well known, Kripke (1980) set forth a causal-historical account\nof reference as an alternative to the descriptivist picture. This\naccount starts with an initial baptism that introduces a name and goes\non with causal chains transmitting the reference of the name from\nspeaker to speaker. In this picture, Aristotle is the man once\nbaptized so; he might not have been the student of Plato or done any\nother thing commonly attributed to him. Kripke thought this picture to\napply both to proper names and general terms. It is hardly indicated,\nhowever, how this picture works for expressions referring to\ntheoretical entities (cf. Papineau 1996). Kripke’s story is\nparticularly counterintuitive in view of the ahistorical manner of\nteaching in the natural sciences, wherein the original, historical\nintroduction of a theoretical term plays a minor role in comparison to\nup-to-date textbook and journal explanations. Such explanations are\nclearly of the descriptivist type. The Kripkean causal story can be\nread as an account of reference fixing without being read as a story\nof grasping the meaning of theoretical terms. Reference, however,\nneeds to be related to meaning so as to ensure that scientists know\nwhat they are talking about and are able to identify the entities\nunder investigation. Notably, even for expressions of everyday\nlanguage, the charge of not explaining meaning has been leveled\nagainst Krikpe’s causal-historical account (Reimer 2010). The\nsame charge applies to Putnam’s (1975) causal account of\nreference and meaning, which Putnam himself abandoned in his 1980.\n \nA purely causal or causal-historical account of reference does not\nseem a viable option for theoretical terms. More promising are hybrid\naccounts that combine descriptivist intuitions with causal elements.\nSuch an account has been given by Psillos (1999: 296):  \nThis account has two particular merits. First, it is much closer to\nthe way scientists understand and use theoretical terms than purely\ncausal accounts. Because of this, it is not only an account of\nreference but also one of meaning for theoretical terms. In purely\ncausal accounts, by contrast, there is a tendency to abandon the\nnotion of meaning altogether. Second, it promises to ensure a more\nstable notion of reference than in purely descriptivist accounts of\nreference and meaning. Notably, the kind of causation that\nPsillos’s hybrid account refers to is different from the\ncausal-historical chains that Kripke thought responsible for the\ntransmission of reference among speakers. No further explanation,\nhowever, is given of what a kind-constitutive property is and how we\nare to recognize such a property. Psillos (1999: 288n) merely infers\nthe existence of such properties from the assumption of there being\nnatural kinds.  \nNon-realist and antirealist semantics for theoretical terms are\nmotivated by the presumption that the problem of theoretical terms has\nno satisfying realist solution. What does a non-realist semantics of\ntheoretical terms look like? The view that theoretical entities are\nmere fictions often figures only in realist portrays of antirealism\nand is hardly seriously maintained by any philosopher of science in\nthe twentieth century. Quine’s comparison of physical objects\nwith the gods of Homer in his 1951 seems to be an exception. If one\nwere to devise a formal or informal semantics for the view that\ntheoretical entities are mere fictions, a purely descriptive account\nseems most promising. Such an account could in particular make heavy\nuse of the Fregean notion of sense. For this notion was introduced,\namong other objectives, with the intent to explain our understanding\nof expressions like ‘Odysseus’ and ‘Pegasus’.\nOne would have to admit, however, that sentences with names that lack\na referent may well have a truth-value and as such deviate from Frege.\nCausal elements do not seem of much use in the fiction view of\ntheoretical entities.  \nFormalist variants of instrumentalism are a more serious alternative\nto realist semantics than the fiction view of theoretical entities.\nFormalist views in the philosophy of mathematics are ones which aim to\naccount for mathematical concepts and objects in terms of syntactic\nentities and operations thereupon within a calculus. Such views have\nbeen carried over to theoretical concepts and objects in the natural\nsciences, with the qualification that the observational part of the\ncalculus is interpreted in such a way that its symbols refer to\nphysical or phenomenal objects. Cognitive access to theoretical\nentities is thus explained in terms of our cognitive access to the\nsymbols and rules of the calculus in the context of an antecedent\nunderstanding of the observation terms. Formalist ideas were\nsympathetically entertained by Hermann Weyl (1949). He was driven\ntowards such ideas by adherence to Hilbert’s distinction between\nreal and ideal elements and the corresponding distinction between real\nand ideal propositions (Hilbert 1926). Propositions of the observation\nlanguage were construed as real ones in the sense of this Hilbertian\ndistinction by Weyl, whereas theoretical propositions as ideal\nones. The content of an ideal proposition is to be understood in terms\nof the (syntactic) consistency of the whole system consisting of ideal\nand real propositions being asserted. This is the defining property of\nan ideal proposition.  \nWe still need to discuss the view that theoretical entities are\nmathematical entities that are related to observable events in certain\ndeterminate ways. This theory is clearly of the descriptivist type, as\nwe shall see more clearly when dealing with the formal account by\nCarnap in\n Section 4.\n No causal elements are needed in Carnap’s Pythagorean\nempiricism.  \nIt is fair to characterize the Pythagorean view in general by saying\nthat it shifts the problem of theoretical terms to the theory of\nmeaning and reference for mathematical expressions. The question of\nhow we are able to refer successfully to electrons is answered by the\nPythagorean by pointing out that we are able to refer successfully to\nmathematical entities. Moreover, the Pythagorean explains, it is part\nof the notion of an electron that corresponding mathematical entities\nare connected to observable phenomena by means of axioms and inference\nrules. The empirical surplus of theoretical entities in comparison to\n“pure” mathematical entities is thus captured by axioms\nand inference rules that establish connections to empirical phenomena.\nSince mathematical entities do not, by themselves, have connections to\nobservable phenomena, the question of truth and falsehood may not be\nput in a truth-conditional manner for those axioms that connect\nmathematical entities with phenomenal events (cf.\n Section 4.2).\n Carnap (1958), therefore, came to speak of postulates when\nreferring to the axioms of a scientific theory.  \nHow do we come to refer successfully to mathematical entities? This,\nof course, is a problem in the philosophy of mathematics. (For a\nclassical paper that addresses this problem see Benacerraf (1973)).\nCarnap has not much to say about meaning and reference of mathematical\nexpressions in his seminal “The Methodological Character of\nTheoretical Concepts” (1956) but discusses these issues in his\n“Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology” (1950). There he\naims at establishing a metaphysically neutral position that avoids a\ncommitment to Platonist, nominalist or formalist conceptions of\nmathematical objects. A proponent of the Pythagorean view other than\nCarnap is Hermann Weyl (1949). As for the cognition of mathematical\nentities, Weyl largely followed Hilbert’s formalism in his later\nwork. Hence, there is a non-empty intersection between the Pythagorean\nview and the formalist view of theoretical entities. Unlike Carnap,\nWeyl did not characterize the interpretation of theoretical terms by\nmeans of model-theoretic notions.  \nFor theoretical functions and relations, a particular problem arises\nfrom the idea that a theoretical term is, by definition, semantically\ndependent upon a scientific theory. Let us recall the above\nexplanation of T-theoreticity: a term t is\nT-theoretical if and only if any method of determining the\nextension of t, or some part of that extension, rests on some\naxiom of T. Let \\(\\phi\\) be such an axiom and \\(m\\) be a\ncorresponding method of determination. The present explanation of\nT-theoreticity, then, means that \\(m\\) is valid only on\ncondition of \\(\\phi\\) being true. The latter dependency holds because\n\\(\\phi\\) is used either explicitly in calculations to determine\nt or in the calibration of measurement devices. Such devices,\nthen, perform the calculation implicitly. A case in point is\nmeasurement of temperature by a gas thermometer. Such a device rests\nupon the law that changes of temperature result into proportional\nchanges in the volume of gases.  \nSuppose now t is theoretical with respect to a theory T.\nThen it holds that in order to measure t, we need to assume the\ntruth of some axiom \\(\\phi\\) of T. Suppose, further, that\nt has occurrences in \\(\\phi\\), as is standard in examples of\nT-theoreticity. From this it follows that, in standard\ntruth-conditional semantics, the truth-value of \\(\\phi\\) is dependent\non the semantic value of t. This leads to the following\nepistemological problem: on the one hand, we need to know the\nextension of t in order to find out whether \\(\\phi\\) is true.\nOn the other hand, it is simply impossible to determine the extension\nof t without using \\(\\phi\\) or some other axiom of T.\nThis mutual dependency between the semantic values of \\(\\phi\\) and\nt makes it difficult, if not even impossible, to have evidence\nfor \\(\\phi\\) being true in any of its applications (cf. Andreas 2008).\n \nWe could, of course, use an alternative measurement method of\nt, say one resting upon an axiom \\(\\psi\\) of T, to gain\nevidence for the axiom \\(\\phi\\) being true in some selected instances.\nThis move, however, only shifts the problem to applications of another\naxiom of T. For these applications the same type of difficulty\narises, viz., mutual dependency of the semantic values of \\(\\psi\\) and\nt. We are thus caught either in a vicious circle or in an\ninfinite regress when attempting to gain evidence for the propriety of\na single measurement of a theoretical term. Sneed (1979: ch. II) was\nthe first to describe that particular difficulty in the present manner\nand termed it the problem of theoretical terms. Measurement\nof the force function in classical mechanics exemplifies this problem\nwell. There is no method of measuring force that does not rest upon\nsome law of classical mechanics. Likewise, it is impossible to measure\ntemperature without using some law that depends upon either\nphenomenological or statistical thermodynamics.  \nThough its formulation is primarily epistemological, Sneed’s\nproblem of theoretical terms has a semantic reading. Let the meaning\nof a term be identified with the methods of determining its extension,\nas in\n Section 1.2.\n Then we can say that our understanding of T-theoretical\nrelations and functions originates from the axioms of the scientific\ntheory T. In standard truth-conditional semantics, by contrast,\none assumes that the truth-value of an axiom \\(\\phi\\) is determined by\nthe semantic values of those descriptive constants that have\noccurrences in \\(\\phi\\). Among these constants, there are theoretical\nterms of T. Hence, it appears that standard truth-conditional\nsemantics does not accord with the order of our grasping the meaning\nof theoretical terms. In the next section, we shall deal with indirect\nmeans of interpreting theoretical terms. These proved to be ways out\nof the present problem of theoretical terms.  \nA few notational conventions and preliminary considerations are\nnecessary to explain the formal accounts of theoretical terms and\ntheir semantics. Essential to all of these accounts is the division of\nthe set of descriptive symbols into a set \\(V_o\\) of observational and\nanother set \\(V_t\\) of theoretical terms. (The descriptive symbols of\na formal language are simply the non-logical ones.) A scientific\ntheory thus be formulated in a language \\(L(V_o,V_t)\\). The division\nof the descriptive vocabulary gives rise to a related distinction\nbetween T- and C-axioms among the axioms of a scientific\ntheory. The T-axioms contain only \\(V_t\\) symbols as\ndescriptive ones, while the C-axioms contain both \\(V_o\\) and\n\\(V_t\\) symbols. The latter axioms establish a connection between the\ntheoretical and the observational terms. TC designates the\nconjunction of T- and C-axioms and \\(A(\\TC)\\) the set of\nthese axioms. Let \\(n_1 ,\\ldots ,n_k\\) be the elements of \\(V_o\\) and\n\\(t_1 ,\\ldots ,t_n\\) the elements of \\(V_t\\). Then, TC is a\nproposition of the following type:  \nAs for the domain of interpretation of \\(L(V_o,V_t)\\), Ramsey (1929)\nassumes there to be only one for all descriptive symbols. Carnap\n(1956, 1958), by contrast, distinguishes between a domain of\ninterpretation for observational terms and another for theoretical\nterms. Notably, the latter domain contains exclusively mathematical\nentities. Ketland (2004) has emphasized the importance of\ndistinguishing between an observational and a theoretical domain of\ninterpretation, where the latter is allowed to contain theoretical\nentities, such as electrons and protons.  \nTC is a first-order sentence in a large number of accounts, as\nin Ramsey’s seminal “Theories” (1929). Carnap (1956;\n1958), however, works with higher-order logic to allow for the\nformulation of mathematical propositions and concepts.  \nwhere \\(X_1 , \\ldots ,X_n\\) are higher-order variables. This sentence\nsays that there is an extensional interpretation of the theoretical\nterms that verifies, together with an antecedently given\ninterpretation of the observation language \\(L(V_o)\\), the axioms\nTC. The Ramsey sentence expresses an apparently weaker\nproposition than TC, at least in standard truth-conditional\nsemantics. If one thinks that the Ramsey sentence expresses the\nproposition of a scientific theory more properly than TC, one\nholds the Ramsey view of scientific theories.  \nWhy should one prefer the Ramsey view to the standard one? Ramsey\n([1929] 1978: 120) himself seemed to have something like a contextual\ntheory of meaning in mind when proposing the replacement of\ntheoretical constants with appropriate higher-order variables:  \nAny additions to the theory, whether in the form of new axioms or\nparticular assertions like \\(\\alpha(0, 3)\\) are to be made within the\nscope of the original \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), \\(\\gamma\\). They are not,\ntherefore, strictly propositions by themselves just as the different\nsentences in a story beginning ‘Once upon a time’ have not\ncomplete meanings and so are not propositions by themselves. \n\\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\gamma\\) figure in this explanation as\ntheoretical terms to be replaced by higher-order variables. Ramsey\ngoes on to suggest that the meaning of a theoretical sentence \\(\\phi\\)\nis the difference between  \nand  \nwhere \\(A\\) stands for the set of observation sentences being asserted\nand (...)\\(^R\\) for the operation of Ramsification, i.e.,\nexistentially generalizing on all theoretical terms. This proposal of\nexpressing theoretical assertions clearly makes such assertions\ndependent upon the context of the theory TC. Ramsey ([1929]\n1978: 124) thinks that a theoretical assertion \\(\\phi\\) is not\nmeaningful if no observational evidence can be found for either\n\\(\\phi\\) or its negation. In this case there is no stock \\(A\\) of\nobservation sentences such that (1) and (2) differ in truth-value.\n \nAnother important argument in favor of the Ramsey view was given later\nby Sneed (1979: ch. III). It is easy to show that Sneed’s problem of theoretical terms\n(which concerns relations and functions) does not arise in the first\nplace on the Ramsey view. For by \\(\\TC^R\\) it is only claimed that\nthere are extensions of the theoretical terms satisfying each axiom of\nthe set \\(A(\\TC)\\) under a given interpretation of the observational\nlanguage. No claim, however, is made by \\(\\TC^R\\) as to whether or not\nthe sentences of \\(A(\\TC)\\) are true. Nonetheless, it can be shown\nthat \\(\\TC^R\\) and TC have the same observational\nconsequences: \nProposition 1   For all \\(L(V_o)\\) sentences\n\\(\\phi\\), \\(\\TC^R\\) \\(\\vdash \\phi\\) if and only if \\(\\TC \\vdash\n\\phi\\), where \\(\\vdash\\) designates the relation of logical\nconsequence in classical logic. \nHence, the Ramsey sentence cannot be true in case the original theory\nTC is not consistent with the observable facts. For a\ndiscussion of empirical adequacy and Ramsification see Ketland (2004).\n \nOne difficulty, however, remains with the Ramsey view. It concerns the\nrepresentation of deductive reasoning, for many logicians the primary\nobjective of logic. Now, Ramsey ([1929] 1978: 121) thinks that the\n‘incompleteness’ of theoretical assertions does not affect\nour reasoning. No formal account, however, is given that relates our\ndeductive practice, in which abundant use of theoretical constants is\nmade, to the existentially quantified variables in the Ramsey\nsentence. One thing we lack is a translation of theoretical sentences\n(other than the axioms) that is in keeping with the view that the\nmeaning of a theoretical sentence \\(\\phi\\) is the difference between\n\\((\\TC \\wedge A \\wedge \\phi)^R\\) and \\((\\TC \\wedge A)^R\\). As Ramsey\nobserves, it would not be correct to take \\((\\TC \\wedge A \\wedge\n\\phi)^R\\) as a translation of a theoretical sentence \\(\\phi\\) since\nboth \\((\\TC \\wedge A \\wedge \\phi)^R\\) and \\((\\TC \\wedge A \\wedge \\neg\n\\phi)^R\\) may well be true. Such a translation would not obey the laws\nof classical logic. These laws, however, are supposed to govern\ndeductive reasoning in science. A proper semantics of theoretical\nterms must take the peculiarities of these terms into account without\nrevising the rules and axioms of deduction in classical logic.  \nThere thus remains the challenge of relating the apparent use of\ntheoretical constants in deductive scientific reasoning to the Ramsey\nformulation of scientific theories. Carnap was well aware of this\nchallenge and addressed it using a sentence that became labeled later\non the Carnap sentence of a scientific theory (Carnap 1958;\n1966: ch. 23):  \nThis sentence is part of a proposal to draw the analytic-synthetic\ndistinction at the global level of a scientific theory (as this\ndistinction proved not to be applicable to single axioms): the\nanalytic part of the theory is given by its Carnap sentence \\(A_T\\),\nwhereas the synthetic part is identified with the theory’s\nRamsey sentence in light of Proposition 1. Carnap (1958) wants \\(A_T\\)\nto be understood as follows: if the Ramsey sentence is true, then the\ntheoretical terms be interpreted such that TC comes out true as\nwell. So, on condition of \\(\\TC^R\\) being true, we can recover the\noriginal formulation of the theory in which the theoretical terms\noccur as constants. For, obviously, TC is derivable from\n\\(\\TC^R\\) and \\(A_T\\) using modus ponens.  \nFrom the viewpoint of standard truth-conditional semantics, however,\nthis instruction to interpret the Carnap sentence appears arbitrary,\nif not even misguided. For in standard semantics, the Ramsey sentence\nmay well be true without TC being so (cf. Ketland 2004). Hence,\nthe Carnap sentence would not count as analytic, as Carnap intended.\nCarnap’s interpretation of \\(A_T\\) receives a sound foundation\nin his (1961) proposal to define theoretical terms using\nHilbert’s epsilon operator, as we shall see in\n Section 4.3.\n  \nThe notion of an indirect interpretation was introduced by Carnap in\nhis Foundations of Logic and Mathematics (1939: ch.\n23–24) with the intention of accounting for the semantics of\ntheoretical terms in physics. It goes without saying that this notion\nis understood against the background of the notion of a direct\ninterpretation. Carnap had the following distinction in mind. The\ninterpretation of a descriptive symbol is direct if and only if (i) it\nis given by an assignment of an extension or an intension, and (ii)\nthis assignment is made by expressions of the metalanguage. The\ninterpretation of a descriptive symbol is indirect, by contrast, if\nand only if it is specified by one or several sentences of the object\nlanguage, which then figure as axioms in the respective calculus. Here\nare two simple examples of a direct interpretation:  \n‘R’ designates the property of being rational.  \n‘A’ designates the property of being an animal.\n \nThe predicate ‘H’, by contrast, is interpreted in\nan indirect manner by a definition in the object language:  \nInterpretation of a symbol by a definition counts as one type of\nindirect interpretation. Another type is the interpretation of\ntheoretical terms by the axioms of a scientific theory. Carnap (1939:\n65) remains content with a merely syntactic explanation of indirect\ninterpretation:  \nThe calculus is first constructed floating in the air, so to speak;\nthe construction begins at the top and then adds lower and lower\nlevels. Finally, by the semantical rules, the lowest level is anchored\nat the solid ground of the observable facts. The laws, whether general\nor special, are not directly interpreted, but only the singular\nsentences. \nThe laws \\(A(\\TC)\\) are thus simply adopted as axioms in the calculus\nwithout assuming any prior interpretation or reference to the world\nfor theoretical terms. (A sentence \\(\\phi\\) being an axiom of a\ncalculus C means that \\(\\phi\\) can be used in any formal\nderivation in C without being a member of the premises.) This\naccount amounts to a formalist understanding of the theoretical\nlanguage in science. It has two particular merits. First, it\ncircumvents Sneed’s problem of theoretical terms since the\naxioms are not required to be true in the interpretation of the\nrespective language that represents the facts of the\ntheory-independent world. The need for assuming such an interpretation\nis simply denied. Second, the account is in line with the contextual\ntheory meaning for theoretical terms as our understanding of such\nterms is explained in terms of the axioms of the respective scientific\ntheories (cf.\n Section 1.2).\n  \nThere are less formalist accounts of indirect interpretation in terms\nof explicit model-theoretic notions by Przelecki (1969: ch. 6) and\nAndreas\n (2010).[2]\n The latter account proves to formally work out ideas about\ntheoretical terms in Carnap (1958). It emerged from an investigation\ninto the similarities and dissimilarities between Carnapian postulates\nand definitions. Recall that Carnap viewed the axioms of a scientific\ntheory as postulates since they contribute to the interpretation of\ntheoretical terms. When explaining the Carnap sentence \\(\\TC^R\n\\rightarrow \\TC\\), Carnap says that, if the Ramsey sentence is true,\nthe theoretical terms are to be understood in accordance with some\ninterpretation that satisfies TC. This is the sense in which we\ncan say that Carnapian postulates contribute to the interpretation of\ntheoretical terms in a manner akin to the interpretation of a defined\nterm by the corresponding definition. Postulates and definitions alike\nimpose a constraint on the admissible, or intended, interpretation of\nthe complete language \\(L(V)\\), where \\(V\\) contains basic and\nindirectly interpreted terms.  \nYet, the interpretation of theoretical terms by axioms of a scientific\ntheory differs in several ways from that of a defined term by a\ndefinition. First, the introduction of theoretical terms may be joined\nwith the introduction of another, theoretical domain of\ninterpretation, in addition to the basic domain of interpretation in\nwhich observation terms are interpreted. Second, it must not be\nassumed that the interpretation of theoretical terms results in a\nunique determination of the extension of these terms. This is an\nimplication of Carnap’s doctrine of partial interpretation\n(1958), as will become obvious by the end of this section. Third,\naxioms of a scientific theory are not conservative extensions of the\nobservation language since they enable us to make predictions.\nDefinitions, by contrast, must be conservative (cf. Gupta 2009).\nTaking these differences into account when observing the semantic\nsimilarities between definitions and Carnapian postulates suggests the\nfollowing explanation: a set \\(A(\\TC)\\) of axioms that interprets a\nset \\(V_t\\) of theoretical terms on the basis of a language \\(L(V_o)\\)\nimposes a constraint on the admissible, or intended, interpretations\nof the language \\(L(V_o,V_t)\\). An \\(L(V_o,V_t)\\) structure is\nadmissible if and only if it (i) satisfies the axioms\n\\(A(\\TC)\\) and (ii) extends the intended interpretation of \\(L(V_o)\\)\nto include an interpretation of the theoretical terms.  \nIn more formal terms (Andreas 2010: 373; Przelecki 1969: ch. 6):  \nDefinition 3 (Set \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) of admissible\nstructures)\n\nLet \\(\\mathcal{A}_o\\) designate the intended interpretation of the\nobservation language. Further, \\(\\MOD(A(\\TC))\\) designates the set of\n\\(L(V_o,V_t)\\) structures that satisfy the axioms \\(A(\\TC)\\).\n\\(\\EXT(\\mathcal{A}_o,V_t,D_t)\\) is the set of \\(L(V_o,V_t)\\)\nstructures that extend \\(\\mathcal{A}_o\\) to interpret the theoretical\nterms, where these terms are allowed to have argument positions being\ninterpreted in a domain \\(D_t\\) of theoretical entities. \nGiven there is a range of admissible, i.e., intended structures, the\nfollowing truth-rules for theoretical sentences are intuitive:  \nDefinition 4 (Truth-rules for theoretical sentences)\n\n\\(\\nu : L(V_o,V_t) \\rightarrow \\{T, F, I\\}.\\) \nThe idea lying behind these rules comes from supervaluation logic (van\nFraassen 1969; Priest 2001: ch. 7). A sentence is true if and only if\nit is true in every admissible structure. It is false, by contrast, if\nand only if it is false in every admissible structure. And a sentence\ndoes not have a determinate truth-value if and only if it is true in,\nat least, one admissible structure and false in, at least, another\nstructure that is also admissible.  \nA few properties of the present semantics are noteworthy. First, it\naccounts for Carnap’s idea that the axioms \\(A(\\TC)\\) have a\ntwofold function, viz., setting forth empirical claims and determining\nthe meaning of theoretical terms (Carnap 1958). For, on the one hand,\nthe truth-values of the axioms \\(A(\\TC)\\) depend on empirical,\nobservable facts. These axioms, on the other hand, determine the\nadmissible interpretations of the theoretical terms. These two\nseemingly contradictory properties are combined by allowing the axioms\n\\(A(\\TC)\\) to interpret theoretical terms only on condition of there\nbeing a structure that both extends the given interpretation of the\nobservation language and that satisfies these axioms. If there is no\nsuch structure, the theoretical terms remain uninterpreted. This\nsemantics, therefore, can be seen to formally work out the old\ncontextual theory of meaning for theoretical terms.  \nSecond, Sneed’s problem of theoretical terms\n (Section 3.2)\n does not arise in the present semantics since the formulation of this\nproblem is bound to standard truth-conditional semantics. Third, it is\nclosely related to the Ramsey view of scientific theories as the\nfollowing biconditional holds: \nProposition 2  \\(\\TC^R\\) if and only if for all\n\\(\\phi \\in A(\\TC), \\nu(\\phi) = T\\). \nUnlike the Ramsey account, however, the present one does not dispense\nwith theoretical terms. It can be shown rather that allowing for a\nrange of admissible interpretations as opposed to a single\ninterpretation does not affect the validity of standard deductive\nreasoning (Andreas 2010). Hence, a distinctive merit of the indirect\ninterpretation semantics of theoretical terms is that theoretical\nconstants need not be recovered from the Ramsey sentence in the first\nplace.  \nThe label partial interpretation is more common in the\nliterature to describe Carnap’s view that theoretical terms are\ninterpreted by the axioms or postulates of a scientific theory (Suppe\n1974: 86–95). The partial character of interpretation is\nretained in the present account since there is a range of admissible\ninterpretations of the complete language \\(L(V_o,V_t)\\). This allows\nfor the interpretation of theoretical terms to be strengthened by\nfurther postulates, just as Carnap demanded in his 1958 and 1961. To\nstrengthen the interpretation of theoretical terms is to further\nconstrain the range of admissible interpretations of \\(L(V_o,V_t)\\).\n \nBoth the Ramsey view and the indirect interpretation semantics deviate\nfrom standard truth-conditional semantics at the level of theoretical\nterms and theoretical sentences. Such a deviation, however, was not\nfelt to be necessary by all philosophers that have worked on\ntheoretical concepts. Tuomela (1973: ch. V) defends a position that he\ncalls semantic realism and that retains standard\ntruth-conditional semantics. Hence, direct interpretation is assumed\nfor theoretical terms by Tuomela. Yet, semantic realism for\ntheoretical terms acknowledges there to be an epistemological\ndistinction between observational and theoretical terms.\nTuomela’s (1973: ch. I) criterion of the theory-observation\ndistinction largely coincides with Sneed’s above expounded\ncriterion. Since direct interpretation of theoretical terms amounts\njust to standard realist truth-conditions, there is no need for a\nfurther discussion here.  \nIn Weyl 1949, Carnap 1958, Feyerabend 1962 and a number of further\npapers we can identify different formulations of the idea that the\naxioms of a scientific theory determine the meaning of theoretical\nterms without these axioms qualifying as proper definitions of\ntheoretical terms. This idea has become almost constitutive of the\nvery notion of a theoretical term in the philosophy of science. Lewis,\nhowever, wrote a paper with the title “How to Define Theoretical\nTerms” (1970). A closer look at the literature further reveals\nthat the very idea of explicitly defining theoretical terms goes back\nto Carnap’s (1961) use of Hilbert’s epsilon operator in\nscientific theories. This operator is an indefinite description\noperator that was introduced by Hilbert to designate some object \\(x\\)\nthat satisfies an open formula \\(\\phi\\). So  \ndesignates some \\(x\\) satisfying \\(\\phi(x)\\), where \\(x\\) is the only\nfree variable of \\(\\phi\\) (cf. Avigad and Zach 2002). Now, Carnap\n(1961: 161n) explicitly defines theoretical terms in two steps:  \nwhere \\(\\bar{X}\\)is a sequence of higher-order variables and\n\\(\\bar{t}\\) a corresponding instantiation. So, \\(\\bar{t}\\) designates\nsome sequence of relations and functions that satisfies TC, in\nthe context of an antecedently given interpretation of \\(V_o\\). Once\nsuch a sequence has been defined via the epsilon-operator, the second\nstep of the definition is straightforward:  \nCarnap could show these definitions to imply the Carnap sentence\n\\(A_T\\). Hence, they allow for direct recovery of the theoretical\nterms for the purpose of deductive reasoning on condition of the\nRamsey sentence being true.  \nLewis (1970) introduced a number of modifications concerning both the\nlanguage of the Carnap sentence and its interpretation in order to\nattain proper definitions of theoretical terms. First, theoretical\nterms are considered to refer to individuals as opposed to relations\nand functions. This move is made coherent by allowing the basic\nlanguage \\(L(V_o)\\) to contain relations like ‘\\(x\\) has\nproperty \\(y\\)’. The basic, i.e., non-theoretical language is\nthus no observation language in this account. Yet, it serves as the\nbasis for introducing theoretical terms. The set \\(V_o\\) of\n‘O-terms’ is best described as our antecedently understood\nvocabulary.  \nSecond, denotationless terms are dealt with along the lines of free\nlogic by Dana Scott (1967). That means denotationless terms, such as\nan improper description, denote nothing in the domain of discourse.\nAtomic sentences containing denotationless terms are either true or\nfalse. Most notably, the free logic that Lewis refers to has it that\nan identity that contains a denotationless term on both sides is\nalways true. If just one side of the identity formula has an\noccurrence of a denotationless term, this identity statement is false.\n \nThird, Lewis (1970) insists on a unique interpretation of theoretical\nterms, thus rejecting Carnap’s doctrine of partial\ninterpretation. Carnap (1961) is most explicit about the indeterminacy\nthat this doctrine implies. This indeterminacy of theoretical terms\ndrives Carnap to using Hilbert’s \\(\\varepsilon\\)-operator there,\nas just explained. For Lewis, by contrast, a theoretical term is\ndenotationless if its interpretation is not uniquely determined by the\nRamsey sentence. For a scientific theory to be true, it must have a\nunique interpretation.  \nUsing these modifications, Lewis transforms the Carnap sentence into\nthree Carnap-Lewis postulates, so to speak:  \nThese postulates look more difficult than they actually are. CL1 says\nthat, if TC has a unique realization, then it is realized by\nthe entities named by \\(t_1,\\ldots,t_k\\). Realization of a theory\nTC, in this formulation, means interpretation of the\ndescriptive terms under which TC comes out true, where the\ninterpretation of the \\(V_o\\) terms is antecedently given. So, CL1 is\nto be read as saying that the theoretical terms are to be understood\nas designating those entities that uniquely realize TC, in the\ncontext of an antecedently given interpretation of the \\(V_o\\) terms.\nCL2 says that, if the Ramsey sentence is false, the theoretical terms\ndo not designate anything. To see this, recall that \\(\\neg \\exists\nx(x=t_i)\\) means, in free logic, that \\(t_i\\) is denotationless. In\ncase the theory TC has multiple realizations, the theoretical\nterms are denotationless too. This is expressed by CL3.  \nCL1–CL3 are equivalent, in free logic, to a set of sentences\nthat properly define the theoretical terms \\(t_i (1 \\le i \\le\nn)\\): \n\\(t_i\\) designates, according to this definition schema, the\ni-th component in that sequence of entities that uniquely\nrealizes TC. If there is no such sequence, \\(t_i (1 \\le i \\le\nn)\\) is denotationless. Even so, the definitions of theoretical terms\nremain true if the complete language \\(L(V_o,V_t)\\) is interpreted in\naccordance with the postulates CL1–CL3, thanks to the use of\nfree logic. Hence, all \\(L(V_o,V_t)\\) interpretations that extend the\nantecedently given interpretation of \\(L(V_o)\\) can be required to\nsatisfy all definitions \\(D_i\\).  \nA few further properties of Lewis’s definitions of theoretical\nterms are noteworthy. First, they specify the interpretation of\ntheoretical terms uniquely. This property is obvious for the case of\nunique realization of TC but holds as well for the other cases\nsince assignment of no denotation counts as interpretation of a\ndescriptive symbol in free logic. Second, it can be shown that these\ndefinitions do not allow for the derivation of any \\(L(V_o)\\)\nsentences except logical truths, just as the original Carnap sentence\ndid. Lewis, therefore, in fact succeeds in defining\ntheoretical terms. He does so without attempting to divide the axioms\n\\(A(\\TC)\\) into definitions and synthetic claims about the\nspatiotemporal world.  \nThe replacement of theoretical relation and function symbols with\nindividual terms was judged counterintuitive by Papineau (1996). A\nreformulation, however, of Lewis’s definitions using second- or\nhigher-order variables is not difficult to accomplish, as Schurz\n(2005) has shown. In this reformulation the problem arises that\ntheoretical terms are usually not uniquely interpreted since our\nobservational evidence is most of the time insufficient to determine\nthe extension of theoretical relation and function symbols completely.\nTheoretical functions, such as temperature, pressure, electromagnetic\nforce etc., are determined only for objects that have been subjected\nto appropriate measurements, however indirect. In view of this\nproblem, Schurz (2005) suggests letting the higher-order quantifiers\nrange only over those extensions that correspond to natural\nkind properties. This restriction renders the requirement of\nunique interpretation of theoretical terms plausible once again. Such\na reading was also suggested by Psillos (1999: ch. 3) with reference\nto Lewis’s (1984) discussion of Putnam’s (1980)\nmodel-theoretic argument. In that paper, Lewis himself suggests the\nrestriction of the interpretation of descriptive symbols to extensions\ncorresponding to natural kind properties.  \nOne final note on indirect interpretation is in order. Both Carnap\n(1961) and Lewis (1970) interpret theoretical terms indirectly simply\nbecause any definition is an instance of an indirect interpretation.\nFor this reason, Sneed’s problem of theoretical terms\n (Section 3.2)\n does not arise. Yet, the pattern of Carnap’s and Lewis’s\nproposals conforms to the pattern of a definition in the narrow sense\nand not to the peculiar pattern of indirect interpretation that Carnap\n(1939) envisioned for the interpretation of theoretical terms. This is\nwhy the indirect interpretation semantics has been separated from the\npresent discussion of defining theoretical terms.  \nThe claim that there are scientific terms that are semantically\ndependent upon a scientific theory goes back to Duhem and\nPoincaré. Such terms came to be referred to as theoretical\nterms in twentieth century philosophy of science. Properties and\nentities that are observable in the sense of direct, unaided\nperception did not seem to depend on scientific theories as forces,\nelectrons and nucleotides did. Hence, philosophers of science and\nlogicians started to investigate the distinct semantics of theoretical\nterms. Various formal accounts resulted from these investigations,\namong which the Ramsey sentence by Ramsey (1929), Carnap’s\nnotion of indirect interpretation (1939; 1958) and Lewis’s\n(1970) proposal of defining theoretical terms are the most prominent\nones. Though not all philosophers of science understand the notion of\na theoretical term in such way that semantic dependence upon a\nscientific theory is essential, this view prevails in the literature.\n \nThe theory-observation distinction has been attacked heavily and is\npresumably discredited by a large number of philosophers of science.\nStill, this distinction continues to permeate a number of important\nstrands in the philosophy of science, such as scientific realism and\nits alternatives and the logical analysis of scientific theories. A\ncase in point is the recent interest in the Ramsey account of\nscientific theories which emerged in the wake of Worral’s\nstructural realism (cf. Ladyman 2009). We have seen, moreover, that\nthe formal accounts of theoretical terms work well with a\ntheory-observation distinction that is relativized to a particular\ntheory. Critics of that distinction, by contrast, have commonly\nattacked a global and static division into theoretical and\nobservational terms (Maxwell 1962; Achinstein 1965). Note finally that\nCarnap assigned no ontological significance to the theory-observation\ndistinction in the sense that entities of the one type would be\nexistent in a more genuine way than ones of the other.
