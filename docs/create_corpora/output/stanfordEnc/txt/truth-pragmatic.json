More broadly, however, pragmatic\ntheories of truth focus on the connection between truth and epistemic\npractices, notably practices of inquiry and assertion. Depending on\nthe particular pragmatic theory, true statements might be those that\nare useful to believe, that are the result of inquiry, that have\nwithstood ongoing examination, that meet a standard of warranted\nassertibility, or that represent norms of assertoric discourse. Like\nother theories of truth (e.g., coherence and deflationary theories)\npragmatic theories of truth are often put forward as an alternative to\ncorrespondence theories of truth. Unlike correspondence theories,\nwhich tend to see truth as a static relation between a truth-bearer\nand a truth-maker, pragmatic theories of truth tend to view truth as a\nfunction of the practices people engage in, and the commitments people\nmake, when they solve problems, make assertions, or conduct scientific\ninquiry. More broadly, pragmatic theories tend to emphasize the\nsignificant role the concept of truth plays across a range of\ndisciplines and discourses: not just scientific and fact-stating\ndiscourse but also ethical, legal, and political discourse as\nwell.\n\n\nPragmatic theories of truth have the effect of shifting attention away\nfrom what makes a statement true and toward what people mean or do in\ndescribing a statement as true. While sharing many of the impulses\nbehind deflationary theories of truth (in particular, the idea that\ntruth is not a substantial property), pragmatic theories also tend to\nview truth as more than just a useful tool for making generalizations.\nPragmatic theories of truth thus emphasize the broader practical and\nperformative dimensions of truth-talk, stressing the role truth plays\nin shaping certain kinds of discourse. These practical dimensions,\naccording to pragmatic theories, are essential to understanding the\nconcept of truth.\n\n\nAs these references to pragmatic theories (in the plural) would\nsuggest, over the years a number of different approaches have been\nclassified as “pragmatic”. This points to a degree of\nambiguity that has been present since the earliest formulations of the\npragmatic theory of truth: for example, the difference between\nPeirce’s (1878 [1986: 273]) claim that truth is “the\nopinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who\ninvestigate” and James’ (1907 [1975: 106]) claim that truth “is\nonly the expedient in the way of our thinking”. Since then the\nsituation has arguably gotten worse, not better. The often-significant\ndifferences between various pragmatic theories of truth can make it\ndifficult to determine their shared commitments (if any), while also\nmaking it difficult to critique these theories overall. Issues with\none version may not apply to other versions, which means that\npragmatic theories of truth may well present more of a moving target\nthan do other theories of truth. While few today would equate truth\nwith expedience or utility (as James often seems to do) there remains\nthe question of what the pragmatic theory of truth stands for and how\nit is related to other theories. Still, pragmatic theories of truth\ncontinue to be put forward and defended, often as serious alternatives\nto more widely accepted theories of truth\n\nThe history of the pragmatic theory of truth is tied to the history of\nclassical American pragmatism. According to the standard account, C.S.\nPeirce gets credit for first proposing a pragmatic theory of truth,\nWilliam James is responsible for popularizing the pragmatic theory,\nand John Dewey subsequently reframed truth in terms of warranted\nassertibility (for this reading of Dewey see Burgess & Burgess\n2011: 4). More specifically, Peirce is associated with the idea that\ntrue beliefs are those that will withstand future scrutiny; James with\nthe idea that true beliefs are dependable and useful; Dewey with the\nidea that truth is a property of well-verified claims (or\n“judgments”). \nThe American philosopher, logician and scientist Charles Sanders\nPeirce (1839–1914) is generally recognized for first proposing a\n“pragmatic” theory of truth. Peirce’s pragmatic\ntheory of truth is a byproduct of his pragmatic theory of meaning. In\na frequently-quoted passage in “How to Make Our Ideas\nClear” (1878), Peirce writes that, in order to pin down the\nmeaning of a concept, we must: \nConsider what effects, which might conceivably have practical\nbearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our\nconception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the\nobject. (1878 [1986: 266]) \nThe meaning of the concept of “truth” then boils down to\nthe “practical bearings” of using this term: that is, of\ndescribing a belief as true. What, then, is the practical difference\nof describing a belief as “true” as opposed to any number\nof other positive attributes such as “creative”,\n“clever”, or “well-justified”? Peirce’s\nanswer to this question is that true beliefs eventually gain general\nacceptance by withstanding future inquiry. (Inquiry, for Peirce, is\nthe process that takes us from a state of doubt to a state of stable\nbelief.) This gives us the pragmatic meaning of truth and leads Peirce\nto conclude, in another frequently-quoted passage, that: \nAll the followers of science are fully persuaded that the processes of\ninvestigation, if only pushed far enough, will give one certain\nsolution to every question to which they can be applied.…The\nopinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who\ninvestigate, is what we mean by the truth. (1878 [1986: 273]) \nPeirce realized that his reference to “fate” could be\neasily misinterpreted. In a less-frequently quoted footnote to this\npassage he writes that “fate” is not meant in a\n“superstitious” sense but rather as “that which is\nsure to come true, and can nohow be avoided” (1878 [1986: 273]).\nOver time Peirce moderated his position, referring less to fate and\nunanimous agreement and more to scientific investigation and general\nconsensus (Misak 2004). The result is an account that views truth as\nwhat would be the result of scientific inquiry, if scientific inquiry\nwere allowed to go on indefinitely. In 1901 Peirce writes that: \nTruth is that concordance of an abstract statement with the ideal\nlimit towards which endless investigation would tend to bring\nscientific belief. (1901a [1935: 5.565]) \nConsequently, truth does not depend on actual unanimity or an actual\nend to inquiry: \nIf Truth consists in satisfaction, it cannot be any actual\nsatisfaction, but must be the satisfaction which would\nultimately be found if the inquiry were pushed to its ultimate and\nindefeasible issue. (1908 [1935: 6.485], emphasis in original) \nAs these references to inquiry and investigation make clear,\nPeirce’s concern is with how we come to have and hold the\nopinions we do. Some beliefs may in fact be very durable but would not\nstand up to inquiry and investigation (this is true of many cognitive\nbiases, such as the Dunning-Kruger effect where people remain\nblissfully unaware of their own incompetence). For Peirce, a true\nbelief is not simply one we will hold onto obstinately. Rather, a true\nbelief is one that has and will continue to hold up to sustained\ninquiry. In the practical terms Peirce prefers, this means that to\nhave a true belief is to have a belief that is dependable in the face\nof all future challenges. Moreover, to describe a belief as true is to\npoint to this dependability, to signal the belief’s scientific\nbona fides, and to endorse it as a basis for action. \nBy focusing on the practical dimension of having true beliefs, Peirce\nplays down the significance of more theoretical questions about the\nnature of truth. In particular, Peirce is skeptical that the\ncorrespondence theory of truth—roughly, the idea that true\nbeliefs correspond to reality—has much useful to say about the\nconcept of truth. The problem with the correspondence theory of truth,\nhe argues, is that it is only “nominally” correct and\nhence “useless” (1906 [1998: 379, 380]) as far as describing\ntruth’s practical value. In particular, the correspondence\ntheory of truth sheds no light on what makes true beliefs valuable,\nthe role of truth in the process of inquiry, or how best to go about\ndiscovering and defending true beliefs. For Peirce, the importance of\ntruth rests not on a “transcendental” (1901a [1935: 5.572])\nconnection between beliefs on the one hand and reality on the other,\nbut rather on the practical connection between doubt and belief, and\nthe processes of inquiry that take us from the former to the\nlatter: \nIf by truth and falsity you mean something not definable in terms of\ndoubt and belief in any way, then you are talking of entities of whose\nexistence you can know nothing, and which Ockham’s razor would\nclean shave off. Your problems would be greatly simplified, if,\ninstead of saying that you want to know the “Truth”, you\nwere simply to say that you want to attain a state of belief\nunassailable by doubt. (1905 [1998: 336]) \nFor Peirce, a true belief is one that is indefeasible and\nunassailable—and indefeasible and unassailable for all the right\nreasons: namely, because it will stand up to all further inquiry and\ninvestigation. In other words,  \nif we were to reach a stage where we could no longer improve upon a\nbelief, there is no point in withholding the title “true”\nfrom it. (Misak 2000: 101) \nPeirce’s contemporary, the psychologist and philosopher William\nJames (1842–1910), gets credit for popularizing the pragmatic\ntheory of truth. In a series of popular lectures and articles, James\noffers an account of truth that, like Peirce’s, is grounded in\nthe practical role played by the concept of truth. James, too,\nstresses that truth represents a kind of satisfaction: true beliefs\nare satisfying beliefs, in some sense. Unlike Peirce, however, James\nsuggests that true beliefs can be satisfying short of being\nindefeasible and unassailable: short, that is, of how they would stand\nup to ongoing inquiry and investigation. In the lectures published as\nPragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking (1907)\nJames writes that: \nIdeas…become true just in so far as they help us get into\nsatisfactory relation with other parts of our experience, to summarize\nthem and get about among them by conceptual short-cuts instead of\nfollowing the interminable succession of particular phenomena. (1907\n[1975: 34]) \nTrue ideas, James suggests, are like tools: they make us more\nefficient by helping us do what needs to be done. James adds to the\nprevious quote by making the connection between truth and utility\nexplicit: \nAny idea upon which we can ride, so to speak; any idea that will carry\nus prosperously from any one part of our experience to any other part,\nlinking things satisfactorily, working securely, simplifying, saving\nlabor; is true for just so much, true in so far forth, true\ninstrumentally. This is the ‘instrumental’ view\nof truth. (1907 [1975: 34]) \nWhile James, here, credits this view to John Dewey and F.C.S.\nSchiller, it is clearly a view he endorses as well. To understand\ntruth, he argues, we must consider the pragmatic\n“cash-value” (1907 [1975: 97]) of having true beliefs and\nthe practical difference of having true ideas. True beliefs, he\nsuggests, are useful and dependable in ways that false beliefs are\nnot:  \nyou can say of it then either that “it is useful because it is\ntrue” or that “it is true because it is useful”.\nBoth these phrases mean exactly the same thing. (1907 [1975: 98])  \nPassages such as this have cemented James’ reputation for\nequating truth with mere utility (something along the lines of:\n“< p > is true just in case it is useful to believe\nthat p” [see Schmitt 1995: 78]). (James does offer the\nqualification “in the long run and on the whole of course”\n(1907 [1975: 106]) to indicate that truth is different from instant\ngratification, though he does not say how long the long run should\nbe.) Such an account might be viewed as a watered-down version of\nPeirce’s account that substitutes “cash-value” or\nsubjective satisfaction for indefeasibility and unassailability in the\nface of ongoing inquiry and investigation. Such an account might also\nbe viewed as obviously wrong, given the undeniable existence of\nuseless truths and useful falsehoods. \nIn the early twentieth century Peirce’s writings were not yet\nwidely available. As a result, the pragmatic theory of truth was\nfrequently identified with James’ account—and, as we will\nsee, many philosophers did view it as obviously wrong. James, in turn,\naccused his critics of willful misunderstanding: that because he wrote\nin an accessible, engaging style his critics “have boggled at\nevery word they could boggle at, and refused to take the spirit rather\nthan the letter of our discourse” (1909 [1975: 99]). However, it\nis also the case that James tends to overlook or intentionally\nblur—it is hard to say which—the distinction between (a)\ngiving an account of true ideas and (b) giving an account of the\nconcept of truth. This means that, while James’ theory might\ngive a psychologically realistic account of why we care about the\ntruth (true ideas help us get things done) his theory fails to shed\nmuch light on what the concept of truth exactly is or on what makes an\nidea true. And, in fact, James often seems to encourage this reading.\nIn the preface to The Meaning of Truth he doubles down by\nquoting many of his earlier claims and noting that “when the\npragmatists speak of truth, they mean exclusively something about the\nideas, namely their workableness” (1909 [1975: 6],\nemphasis added). James’ point seems to be this: from a practical\nstandpoint, we use the concept of truth to signal our confidence in a\nparticular idea or belief; a true belief is one that can be acted\nupon, that is dependable and that leads to predictable outcomes; any\nfurther speculation is a pointless distraction. \nWhat then about the concept of truth? It often seems that James\nunderstands the concept of truth in terms of verification: thus,\n“true is the name for whatever idea starts the\nverification-process, useful is the name for its completed function in\nexperience” (1907 [1975: 98]). And, more generally: \nTruth for us is simply a collective name for verification-processes,\njust as health, wealth, strength, etc., are names for other processes\nconnected with life, and also pursued because it pays to pursue them.\n(1907 [1975: 104]) \nJames seems to claim that being verified is what makes an idea true,\njust as having a lot of money is what makes a person wealthy. To be\ntrue is to be verified: \nTruth happens to an idea. It becomes true, is\nmade true by events. Its verity is in fact an event,\na process: the process namely of its verifying itself, its\nveri-fication. Its validity is the process of its\nvalid-ation. (1907 [1975: 97], emphasis in original) \nLike Peirce, James argues that a pragmatic account of truth is\nsuperior to a correspondence theory because it specifies, in concrete\nterms, what it means for an idea to correspond or “agree”\nwith reality. For pragmatists, this agreement consists in being led\n“towards that reality and no other” in a way that yields\n“satisfaction as a result” (1909 [1975: 104]). By\nsometimes defining truth in terms of verification, and by unpacking\nthe agreement of ideas and reality in pragmatic terms, James’\naccount attempts to both criticize and co-opt the correspondence\ntheory of truth. It appears James wants to have his cake and eat it\ntoo. \nJohn Dewey (1859–1952), the third figure from the golden era of\nclassical American pragmatism, had surprisingly little to say about\nthe concept of truth especially given his voluminous writings on other\ntopics. On an anecdotal level, as many have observed, the index to his\n527 page Logic: The Theory of Inquiry (1938 [2008]) has only\none reference to “truth”, and that to a footnote\nmentioning Peirce. Otherwise the reader is advised to “See\nalso assertibility”. \nAt first glance, Dewey’s account of truth looks like a\ncombination of Peirce and James. Like Peirce, Dewey emphasizes the\nconnection between truth and rigorous scientific inquiry; like James,\nDewey views truth as the verified result of past inquiry rather than\nas the anticipated result of inquiry proceeding into an indefinite\nfuture. For example, in 1911 he writes that: \nFrom the standpoint of scientific inquiry, truth indicates not just\naccepted beliefs, but beliefs accepted in virtue of a certain\nmethod.…To science, truth denotes verified beliefs,\npropositions that have emerged from a certain procedure of inquiry and\ntesting. By that I mean that if a scientific man were asked to point\nto samples of what he meant by truth, he would pick…beliefs\nwhich were the outcome of the best technique of inquiry available in\nsome particular field; and he would do this no matter what his\nconception of the Nature of Truth. (1911 [2008: 28]) \nFurthermore, like both Peirce and James, Dewey charges correspondence\ntheories of truth with being unnecessarily obscure because these\ntheories depend on an abstract (and unverifiable) relationship between\na proposition and how things “really are” (1911 [2008:\n34]). Finally, Dewey also offers a pragmatic reinterpretation of the\ncorrespondence theory that operationalizes the idea of correspondence:\n \nOur definition of truth…uses correspondence as a mark of a\nmeaning or proposition in exactly the same sense in which it is used\neverywhere else…as the parts of a machine correspond. (1911\n[2008: 45]) \nDewey has an expansive understanding of “science”. For\nDewey, science emerges from and is continuous with everyday processes\nof trial and error—cooking and small-engine repair count as\n“scientific” on his account—which means he should\nnot be taken too strictly when he equates truth with scientific\nverification. (Peirce and James also had expansive understandings of\nscience.) Rather, Dewey’s point is that true propositions, when\nacted on, lead to the sort of predictable and dependable outcomes that\nare hallmarks of scientific verification, broadly construed. From a\npragmatic standpoint, scientific verification boils down to the\nprocess of matching up expectations with outcomes, a process that\ngives us all the “correspondence” we could ask for. \nDewey eventually came to believe that conventional philosophical terms\nsuch as “truth” and “knowledge” were burdened\nwith so much baggage, and had become so fossilized, that it was\ndifficult to grasp the practical role these terms had originally\nserved. As a result, in his later writings Dewey largely avoids\nspeaking of “truth” or “knowledge” while\nfocusing instead on the functions played by these concepts. By his\n1938 Logic: The Theory of Inquiry Dewey was speaking of\n“warranted assertibility” as the goal of inquiry, using\nthis term in place of both “truth” and\n“knowledge” (1938 [2008: 15–16]). In 1941, in a\nresponse to Russell entitled “Propositions, Warranted\nAssertibility, and Truth”, he wrote that “warranted\nassertibility” is a “definition of the nature of knowledge\nin the honorific sense according to which only true beliefs are\nknowledge” (1941: 169). Here Dewey suggests that\n“warranted assertibility” is a better way of capturing the\nfunction of both knowledge and truth insofar as both are goals of\ninquiry. His point is that it makes little difference, pragmatically,\nwhether we describe the goal of inquiry as “acquiring more\nknowledge”, “acquiring more truth”, or better yet,\n“making more warrantably assertible judgments”. \nBecause it focuses on truth’s function as a goal of inquiry,\nDewey’s pragmatic account of truth has some unconventional\nfeatures. To begin with, Dewey reserves the term “true”\nonly for claims that are the product of controlled inquiry. This means\nthat claims are not true before they are verified but that, rather, it\nis the process of verification that makes them true:  \ntruth and falsity are properties only of that subject-matter which is\nthe end, the close, of the inquiry by means of which it is\nreached. (1941: 176)  \nSecond, Dewey insists that only “judgments”—not\n“propositions”—are properly viewed as truth-bearers.\nFor Dewey, “propositions” are the proposals and working\nhypotheses that are used, via a process of inquiry, to generate\nconclusions and verified judgments. As such, propositions may be more\nor less relevant to the inquiry at hand but they are not, strictly\nspeaking true or false (1941: 176). Rather, truth and falsity are\nreserved for “judgments” or “the settled outcome of\ninquiry” (1941: 175; 1938 [2008: 124]; Burke 1994): for claims,\nin other words, that are warrantedly assertible. Third, Dewey\ncontinues to argue that this pragmatic approach to truth is “the\nonly one entitled to be called a correspondence theory of truth”\n(1941: 179) using terms nearly identical to those he used in 1911: \nMy own view takes correspondence in the operational sense…of\nanswering, as a key answers to conditions imposed by a lock,\nor as two correspondents “answer” each other; or, in\ngeneral, as a reply is an adequate answer to a question or\ncriticism—; as, in short, a solution answers the\nrequirements of a problem. (1941: 178) \nThanks to Russell (e.g., 1941: Ch. XXIII) and others, by 1941 Dewey\nwas aware of the problems facing pragmatic accounts of truth. In\nresponse, we see him turning to the language of “warranted\nassertibility”, drawing a distinction between\n“propositions” and “judgments”, and grounding\nthe concept of truth (or warranted assertibility) in scientific\ninquiry (Thayer 1947; Burke 1994). These adjustments were designed to\nextend, clarify, and improve on Peirce’s and James’\naccounts. Whether they did so is an open question. Certainly many,\nsuch as Quine, concluded that Dewey was only sidestepping important\nquestions about truth: that Dewey’s strategy was “simply\nto avoid the truth predicate and limp along with warranted\nbelief” (Quine 2008: 165). \nPeirce, James, and Dewey were not the only ones to propose or defend a\npragmatic theory of truth in the nineteenth and early twentieth\ncenturies. Others, such as F.C.S. Schiller (1864–1937), also put\nforward pragmatic theories (though Schiller’s view, which he\ncalled “humanism”, also attracted more than its share of\ncritics, arguably for very good reasons). Pragmatic theories of truth\nalso received the attention of prominent critics, including Russell\n(1909, 1910 [1994]), Moore (1908), Lovejoy (1908a,b) among others.\nSeveral of these criticisms will be considered later; suffice it to\nsay that pragmatic theories of truth soon came under pressure that led\nto revisions and several successor approaches over the next\nhundred-plus years.  \nHistorically Peirce, James, and Dewey had the greatest influence in\nsetting the parameters for what makes a theory of truth\npragmatic—this despite the sometimes significant differences\nbetween their respective accounts, and that over time they modified\nand clarified their positions in response to both criticism and\nover-enthusiastic praise. While this can make it difficult to pin down\na single definition of what, historically, counted as a pragmatic\ntheory of truth, there are some common themes that cut across each of\ntheir accounts. First, each account begins from a pragmatic analysis\nof the meaning of the truth predicate. On the assumption that\ndescribing a belief, claim, or judgment as “true” must\nmake some kind of practical difference, each of these accounts\nattempts to describe what this difference is. Second, each account\nthen connects truth specifically to processes of inquiry: to describe\na claim as true is to say that it either has or will stand up to\nscrutiny. Third, each account rejects correspondence theories of truth\nas overly abstract, “transcendental”, or metaphysical. Or,\nmore accurately, each attempts to redefine correspondence in pragmatic\nterms, as the agreement between a claim and a predicted outcome. While\nthe exact accounts offered by Peirce, James, and Dewey found few\ndefenders—by the mid-twentieth century pragmatic theories of\ntruth were largely dormant—these themes did set a trajectory for\nfuture versions of the pragmatic theory of truth. \nPragmatic theories of truth enjoyed a resurgence in the last decades\nof the twentieth century. This resurgence was especially visible in\ndebates between Hilary Putnam (1926–2016) and Richard Rorty\n(1931–2007) though broadly pragmatic ideas were defended by\nother philosophers as well (Bacon 2012: Ch. 4). (One example is\nCrispin Wright’s superassertibility theory (1992, 2001) which he\nclaims is “as well equipped to express the aspiration for a\ndeveloped pragmatist conception of truth as any other candidate”\n(2001: 781) though he does not accept the pragmatist label.) While\nthese “neo-pragmatic” theories of truth sometimes\nresembled the classical pragmatic accounts of Peirce, James, or Dewey,\nthey also differed significantly, often by framing the concept of\ntruth in explicitly epistemic terms such as assertibility or by\ndrawing on intervening developments in the field. \nAt the outset, neo-pragmatism was motivated by a renewed\ndissatisfaction with correspondence theories of truth and the\nmetaphysical frameworks supporting them. Some neo-pragmatic theories\nof truth grew out of a rejection of metaphysical realism (e.g., Putnam\n1981; for background see Khlentzos 2016). If metaphysical realism\ncannot be supported then this undermines a necessary condition for the\ncorrespondence theory of truth: namely, that there be a\nmind-independent reality to which propositions correspond. Other\nneo-pragmatic approaches emerged from a rejection of\nrepresentationalism: if knowledge is not the mind representing\nobjective reality—if we cannot make clear sense of how the mind\ncould be a “mirror of nature” to use Rorty’s (1979)\nterm—then we are also well-advised to give up thinking of truth\nin realist, correspondence terms. Despite these similar starting\npoints, neo-pragmatic theories took several different and evolving\nforms over the final decades of the twentieth century. \nAt one extreme some neo-pragmatic theories of truth seemed to endorse\nrelativism about truth (whether and in what sense they did remains a\npoint of contention). This view was closely associated with\ninfluential work by Richard Rorty (1982, 1991a,b). The rejection of\nrepresentationalism and the correspondence theory of truth led to the\nconclusion that inquiry is best viewed as aiming at agreement or\n“solidarity”, not knowledge or truth as these terms are\ntraditionally understood. This had the radical consequence of\nsuggesting that truth is no more than “what our peers will,\nceteris paribus, let us get away with saying” (Rorty\n1979: 176; Rorty [2010a: 45] admits this phrase is provocative) or\njust “an expression of commendation” (Rorty 1991a: 23).\nNot surprisingly, many found this position deeply problematic since it\nappears to relativize truth to whatever one’s audience will\naccept (Baghramian 2004: 147). A related concern is that this position\nalso seems to conflate truth with justification, suggesting that if a\nclaim meets contextual standards of acceptability then it also counts\nas true (Gutting 2003). Rorty for one often admitted as much, noting\nthat he tended to “swing back and forth between trying to reduce\ntruth to justification and propounding some form of minimalism about\ntruth” (1998: 21). \nA possible response to the accusation of relativism is to claim that\nthis neo-pragmatic approach does not aim to be a full-fledged theory\nof truth. Perhaps truth is actually a rather light-weight concept and\ndoes not need the heavy metaphysical lifting implied by putting\nforward a “theory”. If the goal is not to describe what\ntruth is but rather to describe how “truth” is used, then\nthese uses are fairly straightforward: among other things, to make\ngeneralizations (“everything you said is true”), to\ncommend (“so true!”), and to caution (“what you said\nis justified, but it might not be true”) (Rorty 1998: 22; 2000:\n4). None of these uses requires that we embark on a possibly fruitless\nhunt for the conditions that make a proposition true, or for a proper\ndefinition or theory of truth. If truth is “indefinable”\n(Rorty 2010b: 391) then this account cannot be definition or theory of\ntruth, relativist or otherwise. \nThis approach differs in some noteworthy ways from earlier pragmatic\naccounts of truth. For one thing it is able to draw on, and draw\nparallels with, a range of well-developed non-correspondence theories\nof truth that begin (and sometimes end) by stressing the fundamental\nequivalence of “S is p” and\n“‘S is p’ is true”. These\ntheories, including disquotationalism, deflationism, and minimalism,\nsimply were not available to earlier pragmatists (though Peirce does\nat times discuss the underlying notions). Furthermore, while Peirce\nand Dewey, for example, were proponents of scientific inquiry and\nscientific processes of verification, on this neo-pragmatic approach\nscience is no more objective or rational than other disciplines: as\nRorty put it, “the only sense in which science is exemplary is\nthat it is a model of human solidarity” (1991b: 39). Finally, on\nthis approach Peirce, James, and Dewey simply did not go far enough:\nthey failed to recognize the radical implications of their accounts of\ntruth, or else failed to convey these implications adequately. In turn\nmuch of the critical response to this kind of neo-pragmatism is that\nit goes too far by treating truth merely as a sign of commendation\n(plus a few other functions). In other words, this type of\nneo-pragmatism goes to unpragmatic extremes (e.g., Haack 1998; also\nthe exchange in Rorty & Price 2010). \nA less extreme version of neo-pragmatism attempts to preserve\ntruth’s objectivity and independence while still rejecting\nmetaphysical realism. This version was most closely associated with\nHilary Putnam, though Putnam’s views changed over time (see\nHildebrand 2003 for an overview of Putnam’s evolution). While\nthis approach frames truth in epistemic terms—primarily in terms\nof justification and verification—it amplifies these terms to\nensure that truth is more than mere consensus. For example, this\napproach might identify “being true with being warrantedly\nassertible under ideal conditions” (Putnam 2012b: 220). More\nspecifically, it might demand “that truth is independent of\njustification here and now, but not independent of all\njustification” (Putnam 1981: 56). \nRather than play up assertibility before one’s peers or\ncontemporaries, this neo-pragmatic approach frames truth in terms of\nideal warranted assertibility: namely, warranted assertibility in the\nlong run and before all audiences, or at least before all\nwell-informed audiences. Not only does this sound much less relativist\nbut it also bears a strong resemblance to Peirce’s and\nDewey’s accounts (though Putnam, for one, resisted the\ncomparison: “my admiration for the classical pragmatists does\nnot extend to any of the different theories of truth that Peirce,\nJames, and Dewey advanced” [2012c: 70]). \nTo repeat, this neo-pragmatic approach is designed to avoid the\nproblems facing correspondence theories of truth while still\npreserving truth’s objectivity. In the 1980s this view was\nassociated with Putnam’s broader program of “internal\nrealism”: the idea that “what objects does the world\nconsist of? is a question that it only makes sense to ask\nwithin a theory or description” (Putnam 1981: 49,\nemphasis in original). Internal realism was designed as an alternative\nto metaphysical realism that dispensed with achieving an external\n“God’s Eye Point of View” while still preserving\ntruth’s objectivity, albeit internal to a given theory. (For\nadditional criticisms of metaphysical realism see Khlentzos 2016.) In\nthe mid-1990s Putnam’s views shifted toward what he called\n“natural realism” (1999; for a critical discussion of\nPutnam’s changing views see Wright 2000). This shift came about\nin part because of problems with defining truth in epistemic terms\nsuch as ideal warranted assertibility. One problem is that it is\ndifficult to see how one can verify either what these ideal conditions\nare or whether they have been met: one might attempt to do so by\ntaking an external “god’s eye view”, which would be\ninconsistent with internal realism, or one might come to this\ndetermination from within one’s current theory, which would be\ncircular and relativistic. (As Putnam put it, “to talk of\nepistemically ‘ideal’ connections must either be\nunderstood outside the framework of internal realism or it too must be\nunderstood in a solipsistic manner ” (2012d: 79–80).)\nSince neither option seems promising this does not bode well for\ninternal realism or for any account of truth closely associated with\nit. \nIf internal realism cannot be sustained then a possible fallback\nposition is “natural realism”—the view “that\nthe objects of (normal ‘veridical’) perception are\n‘external’ things, and, more generally, aspects of\n‘external’ reality” (Putnam 1999: 10)—which\nleads to a reconciliation of sorts with the correspondence theory of\ntruth. A natural realism suggests “that true empirical\nstatements correspond to states of affairs that actually obtain”\n(Putnam 2012a: 97), though this does not commit one to a\ncorrespondence theory of truth across the board. Natural realism\nleaves open the possibility that not all true statements\n“correspond” to a state of affairs, and even those that do\n(such as empirical statements) do not always correspond in the same\nway (Putnam 2012c: 68–69; 2012a: 98). While not a ringing\nendorsement of the correspondence theory of truth, at least as\ntraditionally understood, this neo-pragmatic approach is not a\nflat-out rejection either. \nViewing truth in terms of ideal warranted assertibility has obvious\npragmatic overtones of Peirce and Dewey. Viewing truth in terms of a\ncommitment to natural realism is not so clearly pragmatic though some\nparallels still exist. Because natural realism allows for different\ntypes of truth-conditions—some but not all statements are true\nin virtue of correspondence—it is compatible with the\ntruth-aptness of normative discourse: just because ethical statements,\nfor example, do not correspond in an obvious way to ethical state of\naffairs is no reason to deny that they can be true (Putnam 2002). In\naddition, like earlier pragmatic theories of truth, this neo-pragmatic\napproach redefines correspondence: in this case, by taking a pluralist\napproach to the correspondence relation itself (Goodman 2013). \nThese two approaches—one tending toward relativism, the other\ntending toward realism—represented the two main currents in late\ntwentieth century neo-pragmatism. Both approaches, at least initially,\nframed truth in terms of justification, verification, or\nassertibility, reflecting a debt to the earlier accounts of Peirce,\nJames, and Dewey. Subsequently they evolved in opposite directions.\nThe first approach, often associated with Rorty, flirts with\nrelativism and implies that truth is not the important philosophical\nconcept it has long been taken to be. Here, to take a neo-pragmatic\nstance toward truth is to recognize the relatively mundane functions\nthis concept plays: to generalize, to commend, to caution and not much\nelse. To ask for more, to ask for something “beyond the here and\nnow”, only commits us to “the banal thought that we might\nbe wrong” (Rorty 2010a: 45). The second neo-pragmatic approach,\ngenerally associated with Putnam, attempts to preserve truth’s\nobjectivity and the important role it plays across scientific,\nmathematical, ethical, and political discourse. This could mean simply\n“that truth is independent of justification here and now”\nor “that to call a statement of any kind…true is to say\nthat it has the sort of correctness appropriate to the kind of\nstatement it is” (2012a: 97–98). On this account truth\npoints to standards of correctness more rigorous than simply what our\npeers will let us get away with saying. \nMore recently—since roughly the turn of the twenty-first\ncentury—pragmatic theories of truth have focused on\ntruth’s role as a norm of assertion or inquiry. These theories\nare sometimes referred to as “new pragmatic” theories to\ndistinguish them from both classical and neo-pragmatic accounts (Misak\n2007b; Hookway 2016). Like neo-pragmatic accounts, these theories\noften build on, or react to, positions besides the correspondence\ntheory: for example, deflationary, minimal, and pluralistic theories\nof truth. Unlike some of the neo-pragmatic accounts discussed above,\nthese theories give relativism a wide berth, avoid defining truth in\nterms of concepts such as warranted assertibility, and treat\ncorrespondence theories of truth with deep suspicion. \nOn these accounts truth plays a unique and necessary role in\nassertoric discourse (Price 1998, 2003, 2011; Misak 2000, 2007a,\n2015): without the concept of truth there would be no difference\nbetween making assertions and, to use Frank Ramsey’s nice\nphrase, “comparing notes” (1925 [1990: \n247]). Instead, \ntruth provides the “convenient friction” that “makes\nour individual opinions engage with one another” (Price 2003:\n169) and “is internally related to inquiry, reasons, and\nevidence” (Misak 2000: 73). \nLike all pragmatic theories of truth, these “new”\npragmatic accounts focus on the use and function of truth. However,\nwhile classical pragmatists were responding primarily to the\ncorrespondence theory of truth, new pragmatic theories also respond to\ncontemporary disquotational, deflationary, and minimal theories of\ntruth (Misak 1998, 2007a). As a result, new pragmatic accounts aim to\nshow that there is more to truth than its disquotational and\ngeneralizing function (for a dissenting view see Freedman 2006).\nSpecifically, this “more” is that the concept of truth\nalso functions as a norm that places clear expectations on speakers\nand their assertions. In asserting something to be true, speakers take\non an obligation to specify the consequences of their assertion, to\nconsider how their assertions can be verified, and to offer reasons in\nsupport of their claims:  \nonce we see that truth and assertion are intimately\nconnected—once we see that to assert that p is true is to\nassert p—we can and must look to our practices of\nassertion and to the commitments incurred in them so as to say\nsomething more substantial about truth. (Misak 2007a: 70)  \nTruth is not just a goal of inquiry, as Dewey claimed, but actually a\nnorm of inquiry that sets expectations for how inquirers conduct\nthemselves. \nMore specifically, without the norm of truth assertoric discourse\nwould be degraded almost beyond recognition. Without the norm of\ntruth, speakers could be held accountable only for either insincerely\nasserting things they don’t themselves believe (thus violating\nthe norm of “subjective assertibility”) or for asserting\nthings they don’t have enough evidence for (thus violating the\nnorm of “personal warranted assertibility”) (Price 2003:\n173–174). The norm of truth is a condition for genuine\ndisagreement between people who speak sincerely and with, from their\nown perspective, good enough reasons. It provides the\n“friction” we need to treat disagreements as genuinely\nneeding resolution: otherwise, “differences of opinion would\nsimply slide past one another” (Price 2003: 180–181). In\nsum, the concept of truth plays an essential role in making assertoric\ndiscourse possible, ensuring that assertions come with obligations and\nthat conflicting assertions get attention. Without truth, it is no\nlonger clear to what degree assertions would still be assertions, as\nopposed to impromptu speculations or musings. (Correspondence theories\nshould find little reason to object: they too can recognize that truth\nfunctions as a norm. Of course, correspondence theorists will want to\nadd that truth also requires correspondence to reality, a step\n“new” pragmatists will resisting taking.) \nIt is important that this account of truth is not a definition or\ntheory of truth, at least in the narrow sense of specifying necessary\nand sufficient conditions for a proposition being true. (That is,\nthere is no proposal along the lines of “S is true\niff…”; though see Brown (2015: 69) for a Deweyan\ndefinition of truth and Heney (2015) for a Peircean response.) As\nopposed to some versions of neo-pragmatism, which viewed truth as\n“indefinable” in part because of its supposed simplicity\nand transparency, this approach avoids definitions because the concept\nof truth is implicated in a complex range of assertoric practices.\nInstead, this approach offers something closer to a “pragmatic\nelucidation” of truth that gives “an account of the role\nthe concept plays in practical endeavors” (Misak 2007a: 68; see\nalso Wiggins 2002: 317). \nThe proposal to treat truth as a norm of inquiry and assertion can be\ntraced back to both classical and neo-pragmatist accounts. In one\nrespect, this account can be viewed as adding on to neo-pragmatic\ntheories that reduce truth to justification or “personal\nwarranted assertibility”. In this respect, these newer pragmatic\naccounts are a response to the problems facing neo-pragmatism. In\nanother respect, new pragmatic accounts can be seen as a return to the\ninsights of classical pragmatists updated for a contemporary audience.\nFor example, while Peirce wrote of beliefs being “fated”\nto be agreed upon at the “ideal limit” of\ninquiry—conditions that to critics sounded metaphysical and\nunverifiable—a better approach is to treat true beliefs as those\n“that would withstand doubt, were we to inquire as far as we\nfruitfully could on the matter” (Misak 2000: 49). On this\naccount, to say that a belief is true is shorthand for saying that it\n“gets thing right” and “stands up and would continue\nto stand up to reasons and evidence” (Misak 2015: 263, 265).\nThis pragmatic elucidation of the concept of truth attempts to capture\nboth what speakers say and what they do when they describe a claim as\ntrue. In a narrow sense the meaning of truth—what speakers are\nsaying when they use this word—is that true beliefs are\nindefeasible. However, in a broader sense the meaning of truth is also\nwhat speakers are doing when they use this word, with the proposal\nhere that truth functions as a norm that is constitutive of assertoric\ndiscourse. \nAs we have seen, pragmatic accounts of truth focus on the function the\nconcept plays: specifically, the practical difference made by having\nand using the concept of truth. Early pragmatic accounts tended to\nanalyze this function in terms of the practical implications of\nlabeling a belief as true: depending on the version, to say that a\nbelief is true is to signal one’s confidence, or that the belief\nis widely accepted, or that it has been scientifically verified, or\nthat it would be assertible under ideal circumstances, among other\npossible implications. These earlier accounts focus on the function of\ntruth in conversational contexts or in the context of ongoing\ninquiries. The newer pragmatic theories discussed in this section take\na broader approach to truth’s function, addressing its role not\njust in conversations and inquiries but in making certain kinds of\nconversations and inquiries possible in the first place. By viewing\ntruth as a norm of assertion and inquiry, these more recent pragmatic\ntheories make the function of truth independent of what individual\nspeakers might imply in specific contexts. Truth is not just what is\nassertible or verifiable (under either ideal or non-ideal\ncircumstances), but sets objective expectations for making assertions\nand engaging in inquiry. Unlike neo-pragmatists such as Rorty and\nPutnam, new pragmatists such as Misak and Price argue that truth plays\na role entirely distinct from justification or warranted\nassertibility. This means that, without the concept of truth and the\nnorm it represents, assertoric discourse (and inquiry in general)\nwould dwindle into mere “comparing notes”. \nPragmatic theories of truth have evolved to where a variety of\ndifferent approaches are described as “pragmatic”. These\ntheories often disagree significantly with each other, making it\ndifficult either to define pragmatic theories of truth in a simple and\nstraightforward manner or to specify the necessary conditions that a\npragmatic theory of truth must meet. As a result, one way to clarify\nwhat makes a theory of truth pragmatic is to say something about what\npragmatic theories of truth are not. Given that pragmatic theories of\ntruth have often been put forward in contrast to prevailing\ncorrespondence and other “substantive” theories of truth\n(Wyatt & Lynch, 2016), this suggests a common commitment shared by\nthe pragmatic theories described above. \nOne way to differentiate pragmatic accounts from other theories of\ntruth is to distinguish the several questions that have historically\nguided discussions of truth. While some have used decision trees to\ncategorize different theories of truth (Lynch 2001a; Künne 2003),\nor have proposed family trees showing relations of influence and\naffinity (Haack 1978), another approach is to distinguish separate\n“projects” that examine different dimensions of the\nconcept of truth (Kirkham 1992). (These projects also break into\ndistinct subprojects; for a similar approach see Frapolli 1996.) On\nthis last approach the first, “metaphysical”, project aims\nto identify the necessary and sufficient conditions for “what it\nis for a statement…to be true” (Kirkham 1992: 20; Wyatt\n& Lynch call this the “essence project” [2016: 324]).\nThis project often takes the form of identifying what makes a\nstatement true: e.g., correspondence to reality, or coherence with\nother beliefs, or the existence of a particular state of affairs. A\nsecond, “justification”, project attempts to specify\n“some characteristic, possessed by most true\nstatements…by reference to which the probable truth or falsity\nof the statement can be judged” (Kirkham 1992: 20). This often\ntakes the form of giving a criterion of truth that can be used to\ndetermine whether a given statement is true. Finally, the\n“speech-act” project addresses the question of “what\nare we doing when we make utterances” that\n“ascribe truth to some statement?” (Kirkham 1992: 28).\nUnfortunately, truth-theorists have not always been clear on which\nproject they are pursuing, which can lead to confusion about what\ncounts as a successful or complete theory of truth. It can also lead\nto truth-theorists talking past each other when they are pursuing\ndistinct projects with different standards and criteria of\nsuccess. \nIn these terms, pragmatic theories of truth are best viewed as\npursuing the speech-act and justification projects. As noted above,\npragmatic accounts of truth have often focused on how the concept of\ntruth is used and what speakers are doing when describing statements\nas true: depending on the version, speakers may be commending a\nstatement, signaling its scientific reliability, or committing\nthemselves to giving reasons in its support. Likewise, pragmatic\ntheories often focus on the criteria by which truth can be judged:\nagain, depending on the version, this may involve linking truth to\nverifiability, assertibility, usefulness, or long-term durability.\nWith regard to the speech-act and justification projects pragmatic\ntheories of truth seem to be on solid ground, offering plausible\nproposals for addressing these projects. They are on much less solid\nground when viewed as addressing the metaphysical project. As we will\nsee, it is difficult to defend the idea, for example, that either\nutility, verifiability, or widespread acceptance are necessary and\nsufficient conditions for truth or are what make a statement true. \nThis would suggest that the opposition between pragmatic and\ncorrespondence theories of truth is partly a result of their pursuing\ndifferent projects. From a pragmatic perspective, the problem with the\ncorrespondence theory is its pursuit of the metaphysical project that,\nas its name suggests, invites metaphysical speculation about the\nconditions which make sentences true—speculation that can\ndistract from more central questions of how the truth predicate is\nused and how true beliefs are best recognized and acquired. (Pragmatic\ntheories of truth are not alone in raising these concerns (David\n2016).) From the standpoint of correspondence theories and other\naccounts that pursue the metaphysical project, pragmatic theories will\nlikely seem incomplete, sidestepping the most important questions\n(Howat 2014). But from the standpoint of pragmatic theories, projects\nthat pursue or prioritize the metaphysical project are deeply\nmisguided and misleading. \nThis supports the following truism: a common feature of pragmatic\ntheories of truth is that they focus on the practical function that\nthe concept of truth plays. Thus, whether truth is a norm of inquiry\n(Misak), a way of signaling widespread acceptance (Rorty), stands for\nfuture dependability (Peirce), or designates the product of a process\nof inquiry (Dewey), among other things, pragmatic theories shed light\non the concept of truth by examining the practices through which\nsolutions to problems are framed, tested, asserted, and\ndefended—and, ultimately, come to be called true. Pragmatic\ntheories of truth can thus be viewed as making contributions to the\nspeech-act and justification projects by focusing especially on the\npractices people engage in when they solve problems, make assertions,\nand conduct scientific inquiry. Of course, even though pragmatic\ntheories of truth largely agree on which questions to address and in\nwhat order, this does not mean that they agree on the answers to these\nquestions, or on how to best formulate the meaning and function of\ntruth. \nAnother common commitment of pragmatic theories of truth—besides\nprioritizing the speech-act and justification projects—is that\nthey do not restrict truth to certain topics or types of inquiry. That\nis, regardless of whether the topic is descriptive or normative,\nscientific or ethical, pragmatists tend to view it as an opportunity\nfor genuine inquiry that incorporates truth-apt assertions. The\ntruth-aptness of ethical and normative statements is a notable feature\nacross a range of pragmatic approaches, including Peirce’s (at\nleast in some of his moods, e.g., 1901b [1958: 8.158]), Dewey’s\ntheory of valuation (1939), Putnam’s questioning of the\nfact-value dichotomy (2002), and Misak’s claim that “moral\nbeliefs must be in principle responsive to evidence and\nargument” (2000: 94; for a dissenting view see Frega 2013). This\nbroadly cognitivist attitude—that normative statements are\ntruth-apt—is related to how pragmatic theories of truth\nde-emphasize the metaphysical project. As a result, from a pragmatic\nstandpoint one of the problems with the correspondence theory of truth\nis that it can undermine the truth-aptness of normative claims. If, as\nthe correspondence theory proposes, a necessary condition for the\ntruth of a normative claim is the existence of a normative fact to\nwhich it corresponds, and if the existence of normative facts is\ndifficult to account for (normative facts seem ontologically distinct\nfrom garden-variety physical facts), then this does not bode well for\nthe truth-aptness of normative claims or the point of posing, and\ninquiring into, normative questions (Lynch 2009). If the\ncorrespondence theory of truth leads to skepticism about normative\ninquiry, then this is all the more reason, according to pragmatists,\nto sidestep the metaphysical project in favor of the speech-act and\njustification projects. \nAs we have seen, pragmatic theories of truth take a variety of\ndifferent forms. Despite these differences, and despite often being\naverse to being called a “theory”, pragmatic theories of\ntruth do share some common features. To begin with, and unlike many\ntheories of truth, these theories focus on the pragmatics of\ntruth-talk: that is, they focus on how truth is used as an essential\nstep toward an adequate understanding of the concept of truth (indeed,\nthis come close to being an oxymoron). More specifically, pragmatic\ntheories look to how truth is used in epistemic contexts where people\nmake assertions, conduct inquiries, solve problems, and act on their\nbeliefs. By prioritizing the speech-act and justification projects,\npragmatic theories of truth attempt to ground the concept of truth in\nepistemic practices as opposed to the abstract relations between\ntruth-bearers (such as propositions or statements) and truth-makers\n(such as states of affairs) appealed to by correspondence theories\n(MacBride 2018). Pragmatic theories also recognize that truth can play\na fundamental role in shaping inquiry and assertoric\ndiscourse—for example, by functioning as a norm of these\npractices—even when it is not explicitly mentioned. In this\nrespect pragmatic theories are less austere than deflationary theories\nwhich limit the use of truth to its generalizing and disquotational\nroles. And, finally, pragmatic theories of truth draw no limits, at\nleast at the outset, to the types of statements, topics, and inquiries\nwhere truth may play a practical role. If it turns out that a given\ntopic is not truth-apt, this is something that should be discovered as\na characteristic of that subject matter, not something determined by\nhaving chosen one theory of truth or another (Capps 2017). \nPragmatic theories of truth have faced several objections since first\nbeing proposed. Some of these objections can be rather narrow,\nchallenging a specific pragmatic account but not pragmatic theories in\ngeneral (this is the case with objections raised by other pragmatic\naccounts). This section will look at more general objections: either\nobjections that are especially common and persistent, or objections\nthat pose a challenge to the basic assumptions underlying pragmatic\ntheories more broadly. \nSome objections are as old as the pragmatic theory of truth itself.\nThe following objections were raised in response to James’\naccount in particular. While James offered his own responses to many\nof these criticisms (see especially his 1909 [1975]), versions of\nthese objections often apply to other and more recent pragmatic\ntheories of truth (for further discussion see Haack 1976; Tiercelin\n2014). \nOne classic and influential line of criticism is that, if the\npragmatic theory of truth equates truth with utility, this definition\nis (obviously!) refuted by the existence of useful but false beliefs,\non the one hand, and by the existence of true but useless beliefs on\nthe other (Russell 1910 [1994] and Lovejoy 1908a,b). In short, there\nseems to be a clear and obvious difference between describing a belief\nas true and describing it as useful:  \nwhen we say that a belief is true, the thought we wish to convey is\nnot the same thought as when we say that the belief furthers our\npurposes; thus “true” does not mean “furthering our\npurposes”. (Russell 1910 [1994: 98])  \nWhile this criticism is often aimed especially at James’ account\nof truth, it plausibly carries over to any pragmatic theory. So\nwhether truth is defined in terms of utility, long-term durability or\nassertibility (etc.), it is still an open question whether a useful or\ndurable or assertible belief is, in fact, really true. In other words,\nwhatever concept a pragmatic theory uses to define truth, there is\nlikely to be a difference between that concept and the concept of\ntruth (e.g., Bacon 2014 questions the connection between truth and\nindefeasibility). \nA second and related criticism builds on the first. Perhaps utility,\nlong-term durability, and assertibility (etc.) should be viewed not as\ndefinitions but rather as criteria of truth, as yardsticks for\ndistinguishing true beliefs from false ones. This seems initially\nplausible and might even serve as a reasonable response to the first\nobjection above. Falling back on an earlier distinction, this would\nmean that appeals to utility, long-term durability, and assertibility\n(etc.) are best seen as answers to the justification and not the\nmetaphysical project. However, without some account of what truth is,\nor what the necessary and sufficient conditions for truth are, any\nattempt to offer criteria of truth is arguably incomplete: we cannot\nhave criteria of truth without first knowing what truth is. If so,\nthen the justification project relies on and presupposes a successful\nresolution to the metaphysical project, the latter cannot be\nsidestepped or bracketed, and any theory which attempts to do so will\ngive at best a partial account of truth (Creighton 1908; Stebbing\n1914). \nAnd a third objection builds on the second. Putting aside the question\nof whether pragmatic theories of truth adequately address the\nmetaphysical project (or address it at all), there is also a problem\nwith the criteria of truth they propose for addressing the\njustification project. Pragmatic theories of truth seem committed, in\npart, to bringing the concept of truth down to earth, to explaining\ntruth in concrete, easily confirmable, terms rather than the abstract,\nmetaphysical correspondence of propositions to truth-makers, for\nexample. The problem is that assessing the usefulness (etc.) of a\nbelief is no more clear-cut than assessing its truth: beliefs may be\nmore or less useful, useful in different ways and for different\npurposes, or useful in the short- or long-run. Determining whether a\nbelief is really useful is no easier, apparently, than determining\nwhether it is really true: “it is so often harder to determine\nwhether a belief is useful than whether it is true” (Russell\n1910 [1994: 121]; also 1946: 817). Far from making the concept of\ntruth more concrete, and the assessment of beliefs more\nstraightforward, pragmatic theories of truth thus seem to leave the\nconcept as opaque as ever. \nThese three objections have been around long enough that pragmatists\nhave, at various times, proposed a variety of responses. One response\nto the first objection, that there is a clear difference between\nutility (etc.) and truth, is to deny that pragmatic approaches are\naiming to define the concept of truth in the first place. It has been\nargued that pragmatic theories are not about finding a word or concept\nthat can substitute for truth but that they are, rather, focused on\ntracing the implications of using this concept in practical contexts.\nThis is what Misak (2000, 2007a) calls a “pragmatic\nelucidation”. Noting that it is “pointless” to offer\na definition of truth, she concludes that “we ought to attempt\nto get leverage on the concept, or a fix on it, by exploring its\nconnections with practice” (2007a: 69; see also Wiggins 2002).\nIt is even possible that James—the main target of Russell and\nothers—would agree with this response. As with Peirce, it often\nseems that James’ complaint is not with the correspondence\ntheory of truth, per se, as with the assumption that the\ncorrespondence theory, by itself, says much interesting or important\nabout the concept of truth. (For charitable interpretations of what\nJames was attempting to say see Ayer 1968, Chisholm 1992, Bybee 1984,\nCormier 2001, 2011, and Perkins 1952; for a reading that emphasizes\nPeirce’s commitment to correspondence idioms see Atkins\n2010.) \nThis still leaves the second objection: that the metaphysical project\nof defining truth cannot be avoided by focusing instead on finding the\ncriteria for truth (the “justification project”). To be\nsure, pragmatic theories of truth have often been framed as providing\ncriteria for distinguishing true from false beliefs. The distinction\nbetween offering a definition as opposed to offering criteria would\nsuggest that criteria are separate from, and largely inferior to, a\ndefinition of truth. However, one might question the underlying\ndistinction: as Haack (1976) argues,  \nthe pragmatists’ view of meaning is such that a dichotomy\nbetween definitions and criteria would have been entirely unacceptable\nto them. (1976: 236)  \nIf meaning is related to use (as pragmatists generally claim) then\nexplaining how a concept is used, and specifying criteria for\nrecognizing that concept, may provide all one can reasonably expect\nfrom a theory of truth. Deflationists have often made a similar point\nthough, as noted above, pragmatists tend to find deflationary accounts\nexcessively austere. \nEven so, there is still the issue that pragmatic criteria of truth\n(whatever they are) do not provide useful insight into the concept of\ntruth. If this concern is valid, then pragmatic criteria, ironically,\nfail the pragmatic test of making a difference to our understanding of\ntruth. This objection has some merit: for example, if a pragmatic\ncriterion of truth is that true beliefs will stand up to indefinite\ninquiry then, while it is possible to have true beliefs, “we are\nnever in a position to judge whether a belief is true or not”\n(Misak 2000: 57). In that case it is not clear what good it serves to\nhave a pragmatic criterion of truth. Pragmatic theories of truth might\ntry to sidestep this objection by stressing their commitment to both\nthe justification and the speech-act project. While pragmatic\napproaches to the justification project spell out what truth means in\nconversational contexts—to call a statement true is to cite its\nusefulness, durability, etc.—pragmatic approaches to the\nspeech-act project point to what speakers do in using the concept of\ntruth. This has the benefit of showing how the concept of\ntruth—operating as a norm of assertion, say—makes a real\ndifference to our understanding of the conditions on assertoric\ndiscourse. Pragmatic theories of truth are, as a result, wise to\npursue both the justification and the speech-act projects. By itself,\npragmatic approaches to the justification project are likely to\ndisappoint. \nThese classic objections to the pragmatic theory of truth raise\nseveral important points. For one thing, they make it clear that\npragmatic theories of truth, or at least some historically prominent\nversions of it, do a poor job if viewed as providing a strict\ndefinition of truth. As Russell and others noted, defining truth in\nterms of utility or similar terms is open to obvious counter-examples.\nThis does not bode well for pragmatic attempts to address the\nmetaphysical project. As a result, pragmatic theories of truth have\nevolved often by focusing on the justification and speech-act projects\ninstead. This is not to say that each of the above objections have\nbeen met. It is still an open question whether the metaphysical\nproject can be avoided as many pragmatic theories attempt to do (e.g.,\nFox 2008 argues that epistemic accounts such as Putnam’s fail to\nexplain the value of truth as well as more traditional approaches do).\nIt is also an open question whether, as they evolve in response to\nthese objections, pragmatic theories of truth invite new lines of\ncriticism. \nOne long-standing and still ongoing objection is that pragmatic\ntheories of truth are anti-realist and, as such, violate basic\nintuitions about the nature and meaning of truth: call this “the\nfundamental objection”. The source of this objection rests with\nthe tendency of pragmatic theories of truth to treat truth\nepistemically, by focusing on verifiability, assertibility, and other\nrelated concepts. Some (see, e.g., Schmitt 1995; Nolt 2008) have\nargued that, by linking truth with verifiability or assertibility,\npragmatic theories make truth too subjective and too dependent on our\ncontingent ability to figure things out, as opposed to theories that,\nfor example, appeal to objective facts as truth-makers. Others have\nargued that pragmatic theories cannot account for what Peirce called\nburied secrets: statements that would seem to be either true or false\ndespite our inability to figure out which (see de Waal 1999, Howat\n2013, and Talisse & Akin 2008 for discussions of this). For\nsimilar reasons, some have accused pragmatic theories of denying\nbivalence (Allen Hermanson 2001). Whatever form the objection takes,\nit raises a common concern: that pragmatic theories of truth are\ninsufficiently realist, failing both to account for truth’s\nobjectivity and to distinguish truth from the limitations of actual\nepistemic practice. What results, accordingly, is not a theory of\ntruth, but rather a theory of justification, warranted assertibility,\nor some other epistemic concept. \nThis objection has persisted despite inspiring a range of responses.\nAt one extreme some, such as Rorty, have largely conceded the point\nwhile attempting to defuse its force. As noted earlier, Rorty grants\nthat truth is not objective in the traditional sense while also\nattempting to undercut the very distinction between objectivity and\nrelativism. Others, such as Putnam, have argued against metaphysical\nrealist intuitions (such as “the God’s Eye view”\n1981: 55), while defending the idea of a more human-scale objectivity:\n“objectivity and rationality humanly speaking are what we have;\nthey are better than nothing” (1981: 55). Another response is to\nclaim that pragmatic accounts of truth are fully compatible with\nrealism; any impression to the contrary is a result of confusing\npragmatic “elucidations” of truth with more typical\n“definitions”. For example Peirce’s steadfast\ncommitment to realism is perfectly compatible with his attempting to\ndescribe truth in terms of its practical role: hence, his notion of\ntruth  \nis the ordinary notion, but he insists on this notion’s being\nphilosophically characterized from the viewpoint of the practical\nfirst order investigator. (Hookway 2002: 319; see also Hookway 2012\nand Legg 2014)  \nEven James claimed “my account of truth is realistic”\n(1909 [1975: 117]). Finally, others attempt to undercut the\ndistinction between realism and antirealism though without making\nconcessions to antirealism. Hildebrand argues for embracing a\n“practical starting point” (Hildebrand 2003: 185) as a way\nof going “beyond” the realism-antirealism debate (see also\nFine 2007). Similarly, Price, while admitting that his theory might\nseem “fictionalist” about truth, argues that its bona\nfides are “impeccably pragmatist” (2003: 189) and, in\nfact, “deprive both sides of the realism-antirealism debate of\nconceptual resources on which the debate seems to depend” (2003:\n188; but see Atkin 2015 for some caveats and Lynch 2015 for a\npluralist amendment). Da Costa and French (2003) offer a formal\naccount of pragmatic truth that, they argue, can benefit both sides of\nthe realism-anti-realism debate (though they themselves prefer\nstructural realism). \nWe find, in other words, an assortment of replies that run the gamut\nfrom embracing anti-realism to defending realism to attempting to\nundermine the realist-antirealist distinction itself. Evidently, there\nis no consensus among pragmatic theories of truth as to the best line\nof response against this objection. In a way, this should be no\nsurprise: the objection boils down to the charge that pragmatic\ntheories of truth are too epistemic, when it is precisely their\ncommitment to epistemic concepts that characterizes pragmatic theories\nof truth. Responding to this objection may involve concessions and\nqualifications that compromise the pragmatic nature of these\napproaches. Or responding may mean showing how pragmatic accounts have\ncertain practical benefits—but these benefits as well as their\nrelative importance are themselves contentious topics. As a result, we\nshould not expect this objection to be easily resolvable, if it can be\nresolved at all. \nDespite being the target of significant criticism from nearly the\nmoment of its birth, the pragmatic theory of truth has managed to\nsurvive and, at times, even flourish for over a century. Because the\npragmatic theory of truth has come in several different versions, and\nbecause these versions often diverge significantly, it can be\ndifficult to pin down and assess generally. Adding to the possible\nconfusion, not all those identified as pragmatists have embraced a\npragmatic theory of truth (e.g., Brandom 2011), while similar theories\nhave been held by non-pragmatists (e.g., Dummett 1959; Wright 1992).\nViewed more positively, pragmatic theories have evolved and matured to\nbecome more sophisticated and, perhaps, more plausible over time. With\nthe benefit of hind-sight we can see how pragmatic theories of truth\nhave stayed focused on the practical function that the concept of\ntruth plays: first, the role truth plays within inquiry and assertoric\ndiscourse by, for example, signaling those statements that are\nespecially useful, well-verified, durable, or indefeasible and,\nsecond, the role truth plays in shaping inquiry and assertoric\ndiscourse by providing a necessary goal or norm. (While pragmatic\ntheories agree on the importance of focusing on truth’s\npractical function, they often disagree over what this practical\nfunction is.) \nThe pragmatic theory of truth began with Peirce raising the question\nof truth’s “practical bearings”. It is also possible\nto ask this question of the pragmatic theory of truth itself: what\ndifference does this theory make? Or to put it in James’ terms,\nwhat is its “cash value”? One answer is that, by focusing\non the practical function of the concept of truth, pragmatic theories\nhighlight how this concept makes certain kinds of inquiry and\ndiscourse possible. In contrast, as Lynch (2009) notes, some accounts\nof truth make it difficult to see how certain claims are truth-apt:\n \nconsider propositions like two and two are four or torture\nis wrong. Under the assumption that truth is always and\neverywhere causal correspondence, it is a vexing question how these\ntrue thoughts can be true. (Lynch 2009: 34, emphasis in\noriginal)  \nIf that is so, then pragmatic theories have the advantage of\npreserving the possibility and importance of various types of inquiry\nand discourse. While this does not guarantee that inquiry will always\nreach a satisfying or definite conclusion, this does suggest that\npragmatic theories of truth do make a difference: in the spirit of\nPeirce’s “first rule of reason”, they “do not\nblock the way of inquiry” (1898 [1992: 178]).","contact.mail":"jmcgsh@rit.edu","contact.domain":"rit.edu"}]
