Despite this\nastonishing variety, a newcomer to Lewis's philosophy would be best\nadvised to begin with his metaphysics (especially: 1986a, 1986e,\n1999). There are several reasons. First, the majority of Lewis's work\neither concerns, or substantially overlaps, topics in\nmetaphysics. Second, the metaphysical positions Lewis stakes out are\nstrikingly original and powerfully argued. Third, there is a coherence\nand systematicity to this work that makes it a particularly\nappropriate object for study, in that one sees trademark Lewisian\nphilosophical maneuvers clearly on display. (Indeed, if one wished to\nlearn how to do philosophy in a Lewisian style, the most efficient way\nto do so would be to study his work in metaphysics.) Finally, and\nperhaps most interestingly, Lewis's metaphysics exerted a profound\nregulating influence on the rest of his philosophy: if some otherwise\nattractive position on some philosophical problem could not be made to\nsquare with his overall metaphysical outlook, then it would have to be\nabandoned.\n\n\n\nI should forestall one possible misunderstanding. You might think\nthat, given what I've just said, the way Lewis would recommend\ndoing philosophy is as follows: First you figure out what your basic\nmetaphysical commitments should be; then you turn your attention to\nvarious broad but non-foundational philosophical subject matters\n(personal identity, mental content, the nature of knowledge, theory of\nvalue, etc.), and work out the consequences in each of these arenas of\nyour fundamental metaphysical posits. Nothing could be further from\nLewis's preferred methodology. (Well, maybe relying on divine\nrevelation would be further….) What he in fact recommends is a\nholistic approach: we start with the total body of claims we are\ninclined to believe—whether on the basis of “common\nsense” (an oft-invoked category, for Lewis) or of\nscience—and try our best to systematize it in accordance\nwith standards of theoretical goodness that are themselves endorsed by\ncommon sense and/or science (and so are themselves, to some extent,\nalso up for grabs). A substantial portion of Lewis's overall body\nof philosophical work can thus be seen as an extended—and\nbreathtakingly ambitious—attempt at achieving total\nreflective equilibrium. Here is an especially succinct description\nof this approach:\n\n\n  One comes to philosophy already endowed with a stock of opinions. It\n  is not the business of philosophy either to undermine or to justify\n  these preexisting opinions, to any great extent, but only to try to\n  discover ways of expanding them into an orderly system. (1973b, p.\n  88) \n\n\nStill, while Lewis's method of philosophical inquiry is certainly not\n“bottom-up”, in my opinion it is best to present\nthe results of that inquiry in a bottom-up fashion.  That is\nwhat this essay, and ones to follow, will attempt to do. I will divide\nthe terrain into four parts: Lewis's fundamental ontology; his theory\nof metaphysical modality; his “applied” metaphysics\n(covering such topics as laws of nature, counterfactuals, causation,\nidentity through time, and the mind); and Lewisian methodology in\nmetaphysics. I'll explain these distinctions shortly, but be advised\nthat the present essay will almost exclusively address the first of\nthese four topics.  Other aspects of Lewis's thought are covered\nin the general entry on \n David Lewis.\n\n\n\nOn a traditional conception, metaphysics aims to answer, in a\nsuitably abstract and fully general manner, two questions: \n\nLewis fully endorses this conception: for him, metaphysicians are\nnot in the business merely of analyzing our “conceptual\nscheme” (except insofar as doing so is an effective\nmethod for finding answers to metaphysical questions), nor\nneed they pay any heed to the perennial philosophical calls for the\nabolition of their subject. They are, rather, engaged in an\nunproblematically factual inquiry into the nature of reality—one\nwhose recognizable epistemological pitfalls provide no grounds for\ndoubting its legitimacy: \n\nWe can begin to get a handle on Lewis's audacious and\ncomprehensive answers to our two overarching questions by\ndistinguishing three components to his metaphysical program: \n\nFirst, he offers an account of what the fundamental ontological\nstructure of the world is. Is, and must be—although\nas we'll see, that qualification turns out to be in a certain\nsense trivial. This account of fundamental ontology of course\npresupposes that the word “fundamental” means\nsomething, and in particular manages to cleanly distinguish a certain\ncentral core of one's ontological commitments from the rest.\nSuppose these commitments take the form of views about what entities\n(or “particulars”) there are, and what properties and\nrelations they stand in. Then we can distinguish two questions. Are\nsome entities more fundamental than others—with, perhaps, an\nelite group of entities being the most fundamental? Are some\nproperties/relations more fundamental than others—again, with,\nperhaps, an elite group being the most fundamental? You might find a\n“yes” answer to both questions attractive. (E.g., chairs\nexist, but they are not fundamental-level entities—though perhaps\nquarks are. Likewise, some chairs have the property of being made\nof oak; but this is not a fundamental-level property—though\nperhaps the property of having such-and-such electric charge is.) As\nfor Lewis's own views, with respect to the second question they\nare fairly unambiguous: He is quite clear that a proper ontology must\ninclude not just particulars but also properties and relations (see\nespecially 1983b); he is equally clear that it is a perfectly objective\nand determinate matter which of these properties/relations are more\nfundamental (or, in his terminology, more “natural”) than\nothers (ibid.); he is officially agnostic about whether some\nproperties/relations are most fundamental, or\nperfectly natural (1986f). His views on the first question\nare, to my eyes at least, more difficult to discern—but for\nreasons that, in the final analysis, probably do not\nmatter. See the What's more, to a very great extent he takes it that the route\nto a proper theory of fundamental ontology is by way of a priori\nphilosophical inquiry. (An important qualification will be noted\nshortly.) \n\nSecond, he offers an account of modality, his famous\n“realism” about possible worlds. Lewis, like many\nphilosophers, takes talk of possibility and necessity to be best\nexplicated as disguised quantification over possible worlds (and\npossible inhabitants thereof), and he was endlessly ingenious at\nshowing how to use the resources provided by a theory of\n“possibilia” to produce analyses of a host of modal\nlocutions. But his realism about possible worlds consists in much more\nthan inclusion of such entities into his ontology; indeed, it would\nprobably be better to call Lewis a “reductionist” about\nmodality—reductionist in a way that distinguishes him from\nvirtually every other philosopher of modality. For a typical believer\nin possible worlds will, if asked to explain what they are, give an\naccount that uses modal notions at some crucial point. Perhaps\nshe will say that possible worlds are maximal consistent sets\nof sentences (in some appropriate language); or perhaps she will say\nthat they are certain kinds of maximal properties that reality as a\nwhole could have instantiated. Lewis says no such thing: he\noffers a characterization of possible worlds—and thus of modality\ngenerally—in explicitly non-modal terms. This complete\nsubordination of the modal to the non-modal gives his philosophy of\nmodality a quite radical character, and also sheds light on some of his\nseemingly independent views about the modalities involved in such\nconcepts as causation, law of nature, and chance. (For example, Lewis\nrejects philosophical accounts of laws of nature that rely on any\nprimitive modal notions.) \n\nThird, Lewis offers an account of how facts about everything else\nreduce to the sorts of facts laid out in his accounts of\nfundamental ontology and modality. (Note that given the remarks in the\nlast paragraph, these reductions ultimately rest on facts about\nfundamental ontology alone; no unanalyzed modal notions are\ninvolved in them.) Better: he offers an assortment of distinctive\napproaches for constructing such reductions, of which there are many\nexamples but no single, canonical exposition. At this point I wish to\nmake just three observations about these strategies. First, they can be\nseen to be directed at providing answers to a distinctively\nmetaphysical kind of question, of the form, “What is it for\nsuch-and-such a fact to obtain?” Examples will pin down the\nidea: And so on. It is this kind of question—albeit not always\nphrased in this way, and accompanied by definite views about what\nconstitutes a philosophically appropriate answer—that animate\nwhat we might call Lewis's “applied metaphysics”: the\napplication of his basic positions in ontology and modality to a range\nof perennial metaphysical topics. Note that the reductionist\ncharacter of his approach comes out when we pursue the obvious\nfollow-up questions: For example, what is it for one event to\ncounterfactually depend on another? Roughly, it is for the closest\npossible world in which the second does not occur to be a world in\nwhich the first does not occur. What is it for one world to be closer\nto actuality than another? We'll skip the answer for\nnow—but rest assured that it and the answers to subsequent\nfollow-up questions are designed to hang together in such a way as to\ncollectively display how facts about what causes what ultimately reduce\nto facts about fundamental ontology. And so it goes, for personal\nidentity, free will, the mind, knowledge, ethics, laws of nature, you\nname it. \n\nThe second observation is that it remains far from clear whether we can\ndispense with the notion of “reduce to” (or\n“determined by”, “fixed by”, etc.) in favor of\nsome philosophically more sanitized alternative;\nsee the \n\nThe third observation I wish to make at this point is that Lewis is\nstrongly motivated by a desire for theoretical economy—both with\nrespect to ontology and with respect to ideology. His quest for\nontological economy shows up in the austerity of the kinds of\nfundamental entities he admits into his ontology (he neither shows, nor\ncares to show, any economy with respect to their number). His\nquest for ideological economy shows up in several places, but perhaps\nmost notably in his utter rejection of any unanalyzed modal\nnotions, and—something that hasn't been mentioned\nyet—in his attempted reduction of set theory to mereology and\nplural quantification. More on this in the (forthcoming) article on his\napplied metaphysics, as well as other examples of his focus on\nideological parsimony at work. \n\nLet's take a somewhat closer look, now, at Lewis's\naccount of fundamental ontology. \n\nIt will be useful to start with a view that is almost\nLewis's—almost, but not quite, as it is more opinionated\nthan he would be comfortable with. Stating the view takes but a few\nlines; providing the needed commentary will take longer. Thus,\nAlmost-Lewis says the following: \n\nThe only fundamental entities that are particulars\nare spacetime points. \n\nWhat these particulars are like is given by what perfectly\nnatural monadic properties they instantiate, and what perfectly natural\nrelations they stand in to one another. \n\nAnd that's it. That is, the facts about what fundamental\nparticulars there are, and what perfectly natural properties and\nrelations they instantiate, determine all other facts. Yes, even modal\nfacts, as the (forthcoming) companion article explains. Almost-Lewis\n(and Lewis) believes, of course, in other particulars besides\nspacetime points; it's just that these particulars are not\nfundamental: what it is for them to exist is to be explained, somehow,\nin terms of facts about the fundamental entities. (More on this, in the\nforthcoming companion article on Lewis's applied metaphysics;\nalso, see the \n\nfor some qualifications about Lewis's position.)\n \n\nNotice one consequence: If the facts about what fundamental\nparticulars there are, and what perfectly natural properties and\nrelations they instantiate, determine all other facts, then\nthere is no reason to suppose that composite\nparticulars—particulars that have other particulars as proper\nparts—ever instantiate perfectly natural monadic\nproperties. (Of course, they can perfectly well instantiate the\nvery-but-not-perfectly natural property of having parts that\ninstantiate such-and-such a perfectly natural relation.) Thus,\nif, for example, my laptop has a mass of 3 kg, that is so only in a\nslightly derivative sense: the laptop is composed of parts whose masses\nadd up to 3 kg. \n\nFour questions demand attention: What are “perfectly\nnatural” properties and relations? What does it come to to say\nthat the fundamental particulars are spacetime points? What\ndoes it come to to say that they are spacetime points?\nFinally, what is the relationship between the fundamental ontology\nposited by Almost-Lewis and Lewis's own celebrated thesis of\nHumean Supervenience? Let's consider these topics in turn. \n\nRemember that laying out the foundations of one's ontology\nrequires two things: to say what, fundamentally, there is; and\nto say what it is like, presumably by stating some facts\nabout the fundamental entities. But not just any facts matter. For\nexample, it may be true of some of the fundamental entities that they\ncoexist with at least one pig; but saying so does nothing to help\narticulate the fundamental structure of reality. To do that,\nLewis thinks, one needs a distinction among the properties and\nrelations: some are special, in that it is their pattern of\ninstantiation among the fundamental entities that constitutes the\nfundamental structure of reality—the “joints” along\nwhich nature is to be ultimately carved. These special properties and\nrelations are the “perfectly natural” ones. \n\n(There are a variety of other uses to which Lewis puts the notion of\n“natural” properties, some of which show that what he needs\nis a distinction that admits of gradations, with the perfectly\nnatural properties at one extreme. Many of these additional uses will\nbe mentioned in the (forthcoming) article on his applied metaphysics;\nbut see the \n\nfor an overview.) \n\nIt is not enough merely to appeal to such a distinction;\nfor metaphysics to do its job properly, it must also provide an\naccount. Now, one way to proceed would be to provide a theory\nof what properties and relations are, in which it is stipulated that\nall such things are to count as “perfectly natural”. On\nsuch an approach, while there may well be a property corresponding to\nthe predicate “has mass 5 kg” (for example), there will\nalmost certainly be no property corresponding to the predicate\n“is green” (let alone that familiar gerrymander, “is\ngrue”). Lewis favors a different approach. Given his commitment\nto set theory, he already believes in things that, by his\nlights, deserve to be called the property of being green, and indeed\nthe property of being grue: these are merely certain\nsets—sets of actual and possible objects. (See the\nsection on Lewis' modal metaphysics  in the entry on \n  David Lewis, \n  and the supplement on\n The Natural/Non-natural Distinction.)\n The question for him, then, is\nhow to distinguish among these sets those that are perfectly\nnatural. Here I will present Almost-Lewis as being, almost like Lewis,\nagnostic as between four broad alternatives. (Almost, because Lewis\neventually decided that the first alternative, according to which\nnatural properties and relations are Aristotelian universals, is\nunworkable; see his 1986f for the reasons.) \n\nReturning now to Almost-Lewis's fundamental ontology, the\noptions seem to be these: It might be that a spacetime point (or\nsequence of points) instantiates a perfectly natural property\n(respectively, relation) by instantiating a universal, in the sense of\nArmstrong. It might be that it has it by having as one part a certain\nkind of trope, in roughly the sense of Williams. (Whence we must amend\nslightly, and take these tropes to be the fundamental\nentities.) It might be that it has it by belonging to a special sort of\nset of (actual and merely possible) spacetime points—special\neither on account of the resemblances that unite its members and\ndistinguish them from non-members, or on account of simply being\nperfectly natural. Regardless of which one chooses, Lewis thinks,\none's theory of natural properties and relations ought to respect\nfour philosophically-motivated constraints: \n\nFirst, an adequate theory should be minimal, in\nthe sense that it posits just enough perfectly natural properties and\nrelations for their distribution among the fundamental particulars to\nfully and determinately fix the nature of all of reality: “The\nguiding idea, roughly, is that the world's universals should\ncomprise a minimal basis for characterizing the world completely.\nUniversals that do not contribute at all to this end are unwelcome, and\nso are universals that contribute only redundantly.” (1999, p.\n12) It is clear from the surrounding text that Lewis takes this\nconstraint to govern the various alternatives to a universals account\nof\n naturalness.[3] \n\nSecond, perfectly natural properties and relations are, Lewis\nthinks, non-modal. What, exactly, this means will need to come\nin for more discussion in the (forthcoming) companion article on\nLewis's applied metaphysics, where we discuss his views about\nlaws of nature and related nomological concepts. For the moment, we can\ntake it to mean roughly this (though trouble for this characterization\nquickly arises): the instantiation of a perfectly natural property by\none (fundamental) particular, or of a relation by several, places\nabsolutely no constraints of a logical or metaphysical kind on the\ninstantiation of any other perfectly natural property or relation by\nthat or any other particular or particulars. \n\nThird, they are intrinsic to the particulars that\ninstantiate them—which, all too roughly, means that they\ncharacterize what those particulars are like, independently of what any\nother distinct particular is like. More: The intrinsic nature of any\nparticular is exhausted by what perfectly natural properties\nit\n instantiates.[4]\nThis assumption also allows a theory of natural properties and\nrelations to yield, in a fairly simple way, a definition of\n“perfect duplicate” applicable to any possible objects x\nand y (not necessarily inhabiting the same possible world): x and y are\nperfect duplicates iff they share exactly the same perfectly\nnatural\n properties.[5]\nA\ndefinition of “intrinsic” follows: a property P is\nintrinsic iff any two duplicates x and y (taken from any possible\nworlds) either both have P or both fail to have P. Of course, what we\nreally have here is a tight circle that puts on display how the\nexpressions “intrinsic”, “perfect duplicate”,\nand “perfectly natural” can be interdefined, with the help\nof the modal notion of metaphysical possibility. (See Lewis 1983c and\nLangton & Lewis 1998 for discussion of various strategies for\nbreaking out of this circle.) \n\nThe fourth constraint is purely negative: it is that it should be\nleft to the empirical sciences to fill in the details about\nwhich perfectly natural monadic properties there are\n(at least, in actuality: philosophy might teach us, or at\nleast give us some reason to believe, that there are, in other possible\nworlds, so-called “alien” properties, perfectly natural\nproperties not instantiated in the actual world). Not just any\nempirical science will do: given, in particular, the first of the four\ntheses, it is really the job of fundamental physics to fill in these\ndetails. The special sciences get no say. \n\nWhat about perfectly natural relations? Here matters are less clear.\nLewis certainly thinks that spatiotemporal relations are perfectly\nnatural; what is less obvious is whether, by his lights, physics could\nrationally lead us to reject this claim. For now I will\nsimplify, and have Almost-Lewis add a fifth\nconstraint—one that is in tension at least with the spirit of the\nfourth, and that the real Lewis certainly rejects. It is this: not only\nare spatiotemporal relations perfectly natural, they are the\nonly perfectly natural relations. (The only possible\nones—though remember that given Lewis's reductionism about\nmodality, that is an idle addition.) \n\nThe picture that emerges is this: Reality consists of a multitude of\nspacetime points. Each of these stands in spatiotemporal relations to\nsome others (though not to all others: see the companion\narticle on Lewis's theory of modality). Each instantiates various\nperfectly natural, non-modal monadic properties. That is all there is;\nanything putatively “extra”—facts about laws of\nnature, or about persisting macro-objects, or about causation, or about\nmentality, or about ethics, or about sets, etc.—must somehow\nreduce to that stuff. For Almost-Lewis, this picture captures a\nfundamental truth about the nature of existence. It is roughly right\nthat it is also a necessary truth—a status that would\nseem to fall out automatically, given Lewis's reductionist\naccount of modality. (We will see, in the companion article, reasons\nfor thinking that he is better off simply dismissing any\nquestions about the modal status of his theses about fundamental\nontology.) The only unfinished philosophical business is to\nwork out the right theory of natural properties and relations, and to\nwork out the details of the reduction for particular cases. \n\nThe foregoing Almost-Lewisian thesis about spatiotemporal relations\nis too strong to be tenable: we now have reasonably good reasons, drawn\nfrom quantum physics, for holding that even in the actual world, there\nare perfectly natural relations other than the purely spatiotemporal\nones. (Roughly: the relations—whatever exactly they amount\nto—coded up in the quantum mechanical wave-function.) Two points\nin its defense are, however, worth brief mention: First, seemingly\nobvious counterexamples—involving such basic physical relations\nas being more massive than—in fact aren't\ncounterexamples, since Lewis can deny that they are genuinely\nfundamental or perfectly natural, on the basis that facts\nabout their obtaining reduce to facts about the distribution of monadic\nperfectly natural properties. (Still, they will certainly turn out to\nbe very natural.) Second, if we could at least maintain, as a\ncontingent thesis, that the only perfectly natural relations\nare spatiotemporal ones, then we could plausibly settle an unresolved\nand deeply vexed question about the content of physicalism (the\ndoctrine, to put it rather too crudely, that all there is to the actual\nworld is physical stuff), as explained in the \n\nAt any rate, the thesis that spatiotemporal relations are at least\namong the perfectly natural relations allows us to clarify and\nsimplify Almost-Lewis's position. Specifically, we can say that\nall that it comes to to say that the fundamental entities are\nspacetime points is that they stand in perfectly natural\nspatiotemporal relations to one another.\nFor more, see the \n\nTo say that they are spacetime points, finally, is to say\nthat they have no proper parts. \n\nOne upshot is that my original statement of Almost-Lewis's\nontology needs an amendment: for it was misleading to say that\naccording to him, the fundamental particulars are spacetime\npoints. That's true, but it wrongly suggests that he is making a\nchoice of one fundamental kind of particular, distinguished\nfrom other possible choices by the essential nature of its members. Not\nso. It is more accurate to describe his fundamental ontology thus: \n\nAlmost-Lewis's theses about what fundamental ontology\ncomprises, and how all other facts reduce to facts about it, bears a\nvery close relationship to Lewis's celebrated thesis of Humean\nSupervenience (hereafter: “HS”). But they are not the same,\nand the differences are worth keeping track of. Here is a typical\nstatement of HS (slightly stronger, as we'll see, than the\nversion Lewis officially endorses): No two possible worlds differ with\nrespect to what is true at them, without differing with respect to the\ngeometrical arrangement of their spacetime points, or with respect to\nwhich perfectly natural properties are instantiated at those\n points.[6]\n(Note that so\nstated, HS is automatically metaphysically necessary.) Thus,\nHS is a supervenience claim, logically weaker than\nAlmost-Lewis's claim of reduction. It is also a claim\nthat—for some good reasons and some bad reasons—Lewis\naccepts only in a weaker form that is metaphysically\ncontingent. More significantly, it is no part of HS that facts\nabout possible worlds themselves reduce to anything else;\nwhereas both Almost-Lewis and Lewis are explicit in their commitment to\nthis further claim. Having said all this, it will be worth remembering\nin what follows that Almost-Lewis's position (which, remember,\nincorporates Lewis's modal realism) entails HS. So, any\ndoubts about HS will carry over to Almost-Lewis's fundamental\nontology. \n\nLet's consider now the most salient ways in which\nLewis's own positions about fundamental ontology diverge from\nthose of Almost-Lewis. \n\nFirst, Lewis takes the lessons quantum physics teaches seriously\nenough to withhold endorsement of Almost-Lewis's fifth thesis,\nthat the only perfectly natural relations are spatiotemporal relations.\n \n\nSecond, Lewis is agnostic as to whether, in addition to spacetime\npoints, there might be (in this, or other possible worlds) fundamental\nentities that are occupants of such points. But agnosticism on\nthis score is probably a bad idea: the proposed possibility is not\nclearly intelligible, nor it is clear what its motivation could be.\nFor more, see the \n\nThird, on a plausible story about what non­-fundamental\nentities there are, it will turn out that on Almost-Lewis's view,\neverything that exists is composed of simples (parts, that themselves\nhave no proper parts). Lewis is also agnostic on this score: he takes\nit to be at least an epistemic possibility that there is\n“gunk”: something, every proper part of which itself has a\nproper part (see for example Lewis 1991). Lewis says relatively little\neither about the status of this possibility (in particular, is it more\nthan merely epistemic?), or about its potential ramifications for his\nvarious positions in metaphysics. To keep things simple, I will\ndiscount it for the remainder of this main essay. \n\nFourth, Lewis holds that his thesis of Humean Supervenience is, at\nbest, only contingently true. Of course, given that he\nrecognizes the (metaphysical) possibility of perfectly natural,\nnon-spatiotemporal relations, he should treat HS as at best\ncontingent. But he advances reasons for doing so of a quite different\nsort. They are not particularly good reasons, and so we will pass them\nby; but see the \n\nfor\ndiscussion. \n\nWhat, finally, should we make of Lewis's conception of\nfundamental ontology? A complicated question; I will limit discussion\nto just two important worries. Let's begin by noting the obvious\ninfluence of a certain scientifically-informed conception of the world\nin shaping Lewis's picture of reality. Lewis himself is quite\nexplicit about this influence: \n\nBut there is a less acknowledged influence of first-order\npredicate logic—an influence that is not entirely salutary. It is\nundoubtedly tempting, for philosophers steeped in the use of\nfirst-order logic as a clarifying tool, to assume that the proper\nrepresentation of the ultimate structure of reality must be by means of\nsome (interpreted) first-order language—a language whose various\npredicates could be taken to express the various\nfundamental properties and relations that characterize reality\nat its most basic level. But if we look to physics instead—as we\nsurely ought to—we find that the basic representational tools are\nvariables, that correspond to physical magnitudes.\nTaking seriously the picture of fundamental ontology suggested by these\nrepresentations turns out to matter quite a bit: in particular, there\nare reasons to think that none of the first three theses about natural\nproperties and relations—that they are minimal, non-modal, and\nintrinsic—is tenable without some modification. This\nissue—which we will mostly pass over in what follows, except\nwhere it matters—is explored in more detail in the \n\nThe second significant source of concern about Lewis's\nconception of fundamental ontology is the role—or rather lack\nthereof—that modal notions have in it. This concern has\ntwo aspects. First, one might hold that some, at least, of the\nfundamental properties and relations that characterize reality have\nmodal aspects that are ontologically basic. Consider mass: one\nmight hold that it is metaphysically impossible for there to be a world\ncontaining just two massive particles, accelerating away from each\nother—and that this impossibility somehow flows from the nature\nof mass itself. We will take up this issue in more detail in the\ncompanion article on Lewis's applied metaphysics. \n\nSecond, one might hold that it is one thing to state a thesis\nconcerning what the fundamental structure of reality in fact\nhappens to be; but that it is another, separate matter to\nstate how reality could be. Indeed, most metaphysicians, I\nsuspect, take it to be just blindingly obvious that these are\nconceptually distinct tasks. Granted that one's views on what\nthere is, and what it is like, will have ramifications for one's\nviews on what there could be and what it could be\nlike (most obviously, because things could be the way they\nare; but there may be more interesting and subtle connections\nas well); still, the project of laying out the former views does not\nautomatically complete the project of laying out the\nlatter. \n\nOf course there is a sense in which Lewis agrees: he takes it as\nobvious, after all, that he must supply an account of modality. But the\nstrikingly reductionist character of that account shows that such\nagreement as there is is mighty thin. The next article (forthcoming)\nwill help clarify this quite radical aspect to Lewis's\nmetaphysics.","contact.mail":"ehall@fas.harvard.edu","contact.domain":"fas.harvard.edu"}]
