Problematically, for feminists, the\nopposition between mind and body has also been correlated with an\nopposition between male and female, with the female regarded as\nenmeshed in her bodily existence in a way that makes attainment of\nrationality questionable. “Women are somehow more\nbiological, more corporeal, and more natural than\nmen” (Grosz 1994: 14). Such enmeshment in corporeality was also\nattributed to colonized bodies and those attributed to the lower\nclasses (McClintock 1995, Alcoff 2006). Challenging such assumptions\nrequires feminists to confront corporeality in order to elucidate and\nconfront constructions of sexed difference. The accounts of the\nrelationship between subjectivity, corporeality and identity which\nhave thereby been developed have implications for other aspects of our\ncorporeal existence. Feminist theorists are therefore in active\nconversation with critical race theorists (Alcoff, Ahmed, Crenshaw,\nFanon, hooks, Hill Collins, Gilman, Gooding-Williams, Tate), theorists\nof (dis)ability (Clare, Inahara, Garland-Thomson, Mairs, McRuer,\nShildrick, Thomas, Toombs Wendell), and theorists exploring gender\ndiversity (Bettcher, Lane, More and Whittle, Prosser, Salamon, S. Stone).\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is unsurprising that early western feminists should have regarded\nembodiment with suspicion, choosing instead to stress the rational\npowers of the female mind; for as François Poullain de la Barre\nfamously claimed in 1673, “the mind has no sex” (1673\n[1990: 87]). For some early feminists this meant enthusiastically\nendorsing a dualism between mind and body, with bodily features\nregarded as contingent characteristics of the self, and the\npotentially rational minds as its core. For them, as indeed for later\nfeminists, it was essential to break any suggested deterministic link\nbetween corporeal characteristics, mental faculties and social role.\nReason, they mostly claimed, was a universal human capacity\nindependent of corporeal differences (Wollstonecraft, Mill and Taylor\nMill). There were additional reasons for early feminists such as\nWollstonecraft in the eighteenth century and Taylor Mill in the\nnineteenth, to regard their bodies with suspicion. In the context in\nwhich they lived as middle class women, their bodies were commodities\nto be preened and maintained, to enable them to entice men into\nmatrimony so that they would have the material means to live.\nWomen’s attention to their bodies therefore took the form of\nproducing them as objects for others’ appraisal, and the dangers\nwhich Wollstonecraft saw in this have been echoed in feminist work up\nto the present day. Wollstonecraft’s 1792 text, A\nVindication of the Rights of Woman, provides, as Bordo (1993)\nnotes, a clear example of the disciplining of the female body\nas we, post- Foucault, would now describe it.  \nTo preserve personal beauty, woman’s glory! The limbs and\nfaculties are cramped with worse than Chinese bands, and the sedentary\nlife which they are condemned to live, whilst boys frolic in the open\nair, weakens the muscles … artificial notions of beauty, and\nfalse descriptions of sensibility have been early entangled with her\nmotives of action. (Wollstonecraft 1792 [1988: 55])  \nThe body was also a source of vulnerability. Mill and Taylor Mill were\npreoccupied with the way their susceptibility to illness interrupted\ntheir ability to produce philosophical work and cast the shadow of\nearly death over their life plans. Moreover any celebration of the\nfemale body as source of sensual pleasure was constrained by a risk of\npregnancy. \nThe body also came to prominence in nineteenth century feminism in\nBritain through the campaign led by Josephine Butler against the\nContagious Diseases Act (Jordan 2001). This act permitted women to be\nforcibly examined for venereal disease. Butler extended ideas of\nindividual rights, prominent within liberal political philosophy, to\nrights over one’s body. The campaign of inspection was viewed as\na particularly outrageous violation of such rights and the women\nviewed as victims of male and medical appropriation of their bodies.\nHere we find the beginnings of arguments picked up later in campaigns\nagainst rape and sexual violence, as well as in campaigns for access\nto birth control and abortion, and in the feminist health movement;\nall of which stress women’s rights to control what happens to\ntheir bodies. This absence of control found its most extreme example\nin the case of the bodies of slave women, where the body became\nliterally the property of another, disciplined in a way that bore a\nmarked contrast to that articulated by Wollstonecraft.  \nHer back and her muscle … pressed into field labour where she\nwas forced to … work like men. Her hands were demanded to nurse\nand nurture the white man and his family … Her vagina used for\nhis sexual pleasure … the womb … the place of capital\ninvestment … the resulting child the … surplus worth\nmoney on the slave market. (Omolade 1983: 354) \nIn the nineteenth and early twentieth century the campaign for\nwomen’s suffrage dominated feminist activity in the west. The\nSeneca Falls Convention Statement does not mention the body, but\nSojourner Truth’s famous speech to the Ohio Women’s\nConvention drew attention to the body as a marker of race and class\ndifferences within the feminist movement:  \nI have as much muscle as any man, and can do as much work as any man.\nI have ploughed, and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man\ncould head me! And ain’t I a woman? I could work as much and eat\nas much as a man—when I could get it—and bear de lash a\nwell! And ain’t I a woman? (Truth 1851 [1881: 116]).  \nMoreover, in the writings of Cady Stanton we find a recognition of the\nway bodily markers are used to perpetuate both racial and sexual\noppression:  \nThe prejudice against color, of which we hear so much, is no stronger\nthan that against sex. It is produced by the same cause, and\nmanifested very much in the same way. The negro’s skin and the\nwoman’s sex are both prima facie evidence that they\nwere intended to be in subjection to the white Saxon man. (Stanton\n1860 [1881: 681]) \nFollowing the first world war and the granting of suffrage in many\ncountries, women continued to campaign on issues of sexual equality,\nand control over their bodies. The issue of reproduction came to the\nfore in political philosophies of the right and left. On the political\nright, following the loss of life in the war, motherhood became a\nconcern of the state and a public duty. Moreover increasing concerns\nwith eugenics and racial purity led to a desire to control the\nreproduction of certain groups within society. At the same time,\nwithin United Kingdom feminist circles, the Abortion Reform\nAssociation was formed and echoed both earlier and later feminist\ndemands for the right of every woman to decide what should happen to\nher body. But an implicit dualism remained. The body was seen as\nsomething owned by, and thereby separate from, the self, something\nover which the self had rights. \nNonetheless in the early twentieth century, with the emergence of\npsychoanalysis, came a different model of our relationship to our\nbody, which was to become crucial to later feminist philosophers. For\nFreud the ego, the conscious sense of self, was a bodily ego:\n“the ego is first and foremost a bodily ego” (Freud 1923\n[1962: 26]). This means that our sense of self is a sense of a body,\nand involves an awareness of that body as having a certain shape or\nform. Significantly, the shape or form we experience our body as\nhaving is not dictated simply by anatomy, but by the affective and\nsensory significance with which different parts are invested. (Freud\n1923). Certain aspects of the body have a salience, and other\nanatomical parts do not show up, unless painful, in the sense of our\nbody which constitutes our sense of self (the insides of the body,\nperhaps the back of the knees). Some parts are more significant than\nothers, linked to experiences of pleasure and pain, for example, or to\nthe possibility of effective agency, (the hands), to relations with\nothers, (the face). This insight of Freud and others (Schilder),\ninformed much of the critical theorizing around the body which\nfollowed. \nIt was, however, with the publication of The Second Sex by\nSimone De Beauvoir, that feminist theorizing about the relation\nbetween the body and the self took center stage. Along with other\nphenomenologists, particularly Merleau-Ponty, and Sartre, Beauvoir\nrecognizes that “to be present in the world implies strictly\nthat there exists a body which is at once a material thing in the\nworld and a point of view towards the world” (Beauvoir 1949\n[1982: 39]). The self, for phenomenologists, as for Freud, is\nnecessarily corporeal, the body constitutes the self. It is not a\nseparate entity to which the self stands in relation. This body,\nhowever, is not simply what biology offers us an account of. The body\nwhich gained their attention was the body as lived, as\nyielding the sensory experiences and lived intentionality of a subject\nnegotiating its world. It is also a body which is encountered by\nothers whose response to it mediates our own sense of being. What is\ncentral to Beauvoir’s account is that such bodily existence, the\npoint of view it provides, and the response it garners, is different\nfor men and women. Her account provides a complex and non-reductive\npicture of the intertwining of the material and the cultural in the\nformation of our embodied selves (see the entry on\n Simone de Beauvoir, Kruks 2010,\nSandford 2006, Moi\n1999). \nIn the first chapter of The Second Sex Beauvoir reviews the\ndata of biology. But she does so with a warning. Such data are not to\nbe thought of as determining individual characteristics or social\nlife. With that warning she goes on to describe what are claimed as\nbiological characteristics of the female qua animal or\norganism which, in addition to differences in reproductive\nrole, includes claims that “woman is weaker than man,\nshe has less muscular strength, … can lift less heavy\nweights” (1949 [1982: 66]). She rehearses these\n“facts” while also declaring that “in themselves\n[such facts] have no significance” (1949 [1982: 66]). This is\nbecause “it is only in a human perspective that we can compare\nthe female and the male of the human species”, and from this\nhuman perspective “the physiological facts … take on\nmeaning, this meaning … dependent on a whole context”\n(1949 [1982: 66]). So, for example, in relation to “the burden\nimposed on women by her reproductive function … society alone\nis the arbiter” (1949 [1982: 67]). \nSuch remarks have led to Beauvoir being regarded as an originator of\nthe sex/gender dichotomy, which became pivotal to feminist theorizing\nin the 1970s (see the entry:\n feminist perspectives on sex and gender).\n Standardly sex was seen as fixed by biology, and gender, as the\nsocial meanings attached to such biology, seen as historically and\nsocially variable, and open to change. It is in this context that\nBeauvoir’s famous claim that “One is not born, but rather\nbecomes, a woman”, is consistently quoted (1949 [1982: 295]).\nNonetheless Beauvoir’s own position does not map onto this sex\n/gender distinction in a straightforward way (Sandford\n2006, Lennon and Alsop 2019, cp 4). For her the\ndata of biology, offered as facts, lack the fixity which later\naccounts sometimes took for granted. She shows herself aware of the\nway in which cultural myths and metaphors influence the telling of the\nbiological story, even as she herself offers it to us. In pointing out\nthe ideological influence on the descriptions of the active sperm and\nthe passive egg (1949 [1982: 44] she anticipates the work of later writers\n(Martin 1987). Moreover she shows herself consistently aware of the\npossibilities which the biological data leave open to us, stressing\nalternatives to heterosexual reproduction throughout the biological\nrealm, the incidence of hermaphrodism in human and other animals, and\ndrawing attention in the animal kingdom to cases where care of the\neggs and the young is done by both male and female animals. The\nconsequence is that not even the biology of sexual difference is\ndetermined.  \nIt is only through existence that the facts are manifest\n… and nothing requires that this body have this or that\nparticular structure … the perpetuation of the species does not\nnecessitate sexual differentiation … [while] it remains true\nthat both a mind without a body and an immortal man are strictly\ninconceivable … we can imagine a parthenogenetic or\nhermaphroditic society. (1949 [1982: 390], my emphasis)  \nOn the other hand, the meanings and significance which we attach to\nour materiality do not float free of that materiality. The way the\nbody is lived by us has to accommodate the data which biology variably\ntries to capture, including facts of reproduction, menstruation and\nmenopause. “Sex” for Beauvoir was not, then, a biological\ncategory. It is, as Sandford (2006), points out an existential one.\nAnd in exploring what constituted existing as a woman, biological data\nwas just one of the constituents. \nIn later chapters Beauvoir provides a phenomenology of the body as\nlived throughout the different stages of a woman’s life. Here\nshe is explicitly offering her narrative as an account of lived\nexperience, the body in situation. In childhood the young girl’s\nbody is experienced in a different way from that of the young boy. She\nis trained into a different way of inhabiting it. He is encouraged to\nclimb trees and play rough games. She is encouraged to treat her whole\nperson as a doll, “a passive object … an inert given\nobject” (1949 [1982: 306–307]). The consequence is an\ninhibited intentionality, her spontaneous movements inhibited,\n“the exuberance of life … restrained” (1949 [1982:\n323]), “lack of physical power” leading to a\n“general timidity” (1949 [1982: 355]). The account\nwhich Beauvoir is offering here is one in which girls undergo\nsomething like a training in bodily habits which structure the\npossibilities for interaction with their world. \nAs the girl enters puberty, Beauvoir notes, her body becomes to her a\nsource of horror and shame. “This new growth in her armpits\ntransforms her into a kind of animal or algae” (1949 [1982:\n333]), her menstrual blood a source of disgust. These negative\ndescriptions are continued for sexual initiation, marriage, and\nmotherhood. Her phenomenology of the maternal body has been especially\ncontroversial:  \nensnared by nature the pregnant women is plant and animal … an\nincubator, a conscious and free individual who has become life’s\npassive instrument … not so much mothers… as fertile\norganisms, like fowls with high egg production. (1949 [1982: 513])\n \nThese accounts have been a source of criticism, particularly when\nlater feminists sought to celebrate the female body as a source of\npleasure, fertility, and empowerment, (see below). However it is\nimportant to recognize that what she was offering was a descriptive\nphenomenology of female bodies as lived in specific situations. She\nwas describing a particular set of experiences at a specific social\nand historical point. As she explicitly says:  \nif the biological condition of women does constitute a handicap, it is\nbecause of her general situation …. It is in a total situation\nwhich leaves her few outlets that her peculiarities take on their\nimportance. (1949 [1982: 356–357])  \nIt is this situation which her writings aimed to highlight and\nchange. \nThe way in which the young girl and then the woman experiences her\nbody is, for Beauvoir, a consequence of a process of internalizing the\nview of it under the gaze of others.  \nThrough compliments and admonishments, through images and words, she\ndiscovers the meaning of the words pretty and ugly; she soon knows\nthat to be pleased is to be pretty as a picture; she tries to resemble\nan image, she disguises herself, she looks at herself in the mirror,\nshe compares herself to princesses and fairies from tales. (1949\n[2010: 304])  \nHere is the beginning of the way in which women live their bodies as\nobjects for another’s gaze, something which has its origin not\nin anatomy but in “education and surroundings” (1949\n[2010: 304]). Beauvoir’s account of the way in which women live\ntheir bodies in such an objectified way, internalizing the gaze and\nproducing their bodies as objects for others, has been one of her most\nimportant contributions to a phenomenology of female embodiment,\nanticipating and influencing the work of later feminists such as\nBartky and Young (see below sections 5.1 and 7.1)   . \nBeauvoir’s phenomenology of women’s experience was also,\nitself, influential on, and in conversation with, philosophers\ntheorizing raced embodiment. The phenomenological writer Franz Fanon,\n(Black Skins White Masks, 1952 [1968]) describes how, on his\narrival in France, he discovers his blackness:  \nI discovered myself as an object among other objects…the other\nfixes me, just like a dye is used to fix a chemical\nsolution….It is not a question of the Black being black\nanymore, but rather of his being Black opposite the White…we\ncame to have to confront the white gaze …. I was all at once\nresponsible for my body, responsible for my race, for my ancestors. I\nran an objective gaze over myself, discovering my blackness, my ethnic\ncharacteristics and then I was deafened by cannibalism, intellectual\ndeficiency fetishism, racial defects, slave ships, and above all,\nabove all else, “Sho good Banana”. (1952 [1968:\n185–186])  \nLater theorists have, however, pointed out that in, offering her own\naccount, Beauvoir herself failed to recognize the way in which both\nrace and gender intersect in providing a phenomenology of\nlived corporeality (Gines 2017; see the discussion of\nintersectionality in\n section 4 below). \nThe descriptions which Beauvoir offers us of the female body as lived,\nare in marked contrast to the valorization of that body which we find\nin the writings of sexual difference theorists: “What is at\nstake in the debate … is the positive project of turning\ndifference into a strength, of affirming its positivity”\n(Braidotti 1994: 187). Engagement with female embodiment, the goal of\nwhich is to give positive accounts of it, are found in two different\nstrands of feminist thought: Anglo-American radical feminism\n(particularly in the late 1970s and 80s) and psychoanalytic feminism,\ndrawing on the work of Freud and Lacan. Sexual difference theorists,\nwhether working from a radical feminist tradition or from a\npsychoanalytic feminist tradition, insist on the specificity of female\nembodiment, a horizon which becomes invisible when the male is taken\nas the norm of the human. For many of these theorists sexual\ndifference is fundamental and immutable. Braidotti claims “being\na woman is always already there as the ontological precondition for my\nexistential becoming as a subject” (1994: 187). \nThere are some controversies over exactly what is to be termed radical\nfeminism. As used here the term refers to feminists who stress\nessential or very deep rooted differences between men and women, and\nwho celebrate the distinctive modes of embodiment and experiential\ncapacities that women have. Radical feminists were/ are centrally\ninvolved in highlighting sexual violence against women globally, which\nthey sometimes see as rooted in male nature, or deep processes of\nsocialization. Despite Shulamith Firestone’s (1970 [1979]; Merck\nand Sandford 2010), early visions of liberating women from\nreproductive tasks; within most Anglo-American radical feminism, both\nfemale sexuality and the female capacity to give birth are seen as\ngrounds for affirming the power and the value of the female body.\nFemale sexuality is celebrated for its power and its supposed capacity\nto escape from structures of dominance and submission, (Rich 1979). Women’s maternal bodies are seen as a source of\npositive values to set against male norms, stressing care and\ninter-subjectivity, as opposed to autonomy and duty (Rich 1979,\nRuddick 1989). Women’s engagement with the reproductive process\nis also regarded as anchoring both anti-militarism and a respect for\nthe natural world, which puts them at the forefront of peace and\necological movements (Griffin 1978). Reproduction and their caring\nroles also sets them against the widespread violence of men. These\napproaches are very significant for giving women’s bodies a\npositive value which induces pride rather than shame. However, such\napproaches also suffer from the dangers of homogenizing what are very\nvariable experiences both of sexuality and maternity. As Grimshaw\npoints out, for women childbearing has been seen “both as the\nsource of … greatest joy and as the root of their worst\nsuffering” (1986: 73). Moreover woman themselves engage in\nmilitary professions, and can themselves be violent in private and public space. Claims\ncelebrating female embodiment therefore need to heed Beauvoir’s\ninsistence that the experience of embodiment is a product of\nsituation. \nIn the work of Irigaray, (1975, 1977, 1993), we find a sustained\ncritique of both philosophy and psychoanalysis, for their masculinist\npresuppositions. She points out that in these bodies of work\n“man” is presented as the universal norm, and sexual\ndifference is not recognized, or it is recognized in such a way that\nwoman is conceptualized as the “maternal-feminine”, which\nhas been left behind in the move to abstract thought. Such a critique\ninsists on the recognition of sexual difference and the difference\nthat female corporeality can make to the shape which thought can take.\nShe makes here what may seem like a rather startling claim: namely\nthat the morphology of the body is reflected in the morphology of\ncertain thought processes. So, for example, western rationality is\nmarked by principles of identity, non-contradiction, binarism, atomism\nand determinate individuation. She sees this as: “the one of\nform, of the individual, of the (male) sex organ”. In contrast:\n“the contact of at least two (lips) keeps woman in touch with\nherself” (1977 [1985: 79]), and suggests an ambiguity of individuation, a fluidity\nand mobility, a rejection of stable forms. \nSuch claims have been interpreted by some as suggesting that Irigaray\nis a biological essentialist, that she sees the biology of male and\nfemale bodies as yielding (potentially) different patterns of thought,\nand that she is insisting that the thinking and writing which is\nexpressive of women’s bodies should be made visible. In contrast\nto such a reading however, is Irigaray’s own insistence on the\nimpossibility of returning to a body outside of its representation\nwithin culture. This makes evident that the bodily features which she\ninvokes in her writings are not brute materialities, but, (as is\nperhaps made clearest in Whitford 1991), bodies as they\nfeature in the interconnected symbolic and imaginary of western\nculture. (1991: chapter 3). When Irigaray refers to male and female\nbodily characteristics she is, according to Whitford, capturing the\nway she finds these features both represented and imagined, that is,\naffectively experienced, in the personal and social domain. She argues\nfor the need to reconstruct an inter-connected imaginary and symbolic\nof the female body which is liveable and positive for women. Whitford\nsuggests this is not an essentialist task of providing an accurate\ndescription of women’s bodies as they really are. It is a\ncreative one in which the female body is lovingly re-imagined and\nrearticulated to enable women to both feel and think differently about\ntheir embodied form. Irigaray’s attention to the imaginary body\nis, however, informed by a respect for a materiality, a nature, which\nalthough open to multiple modes of disclosure, offers us two kinds\nof sexed bodies, to which our imaginary significations remain\nanswerable. \nIrigaray herself considers how philosophical and psychoanalytic\nthinking would be different if we took a re-imagined female or\nmaternal body as its starting point instead of the male body, imagined\nin phallic terms. Such work has been continued in the writings of, for\nexample, Battersby (1998), Cavarero (1995) and Alison Stone (2011).\nBattersby explores “what happens to the notion of identity if we\ntreat the embodied female as the norm for models of the self”\n(1998: 38). Natality challenges a fixed conception of identity, makes\nevident that self and non-self are not in opposition, and that\nidentity “erupts from the flesh” (1998: 39). For Cavarero\nthe lack of attention paid to the fact that we are born from woman has\ngiven western metaphysics a preoccupation with death rather than\nbirth. Stone (2011) explores the maternal body to suggest models of\nsubjectivity of a new kind, immersed in relations of intimacy and\ndependence. Stone “analyses this form of subjectivity in terms\nof how the mother typically reproduces with her child her history of\nbodily relations with her own mother, leading to a distinctive\nmaternal and cyclical form of lived time” (2011: Jacket). \nBoth the foundational status and the inevitability\nof sexual difference has become a key point of contention between\nsexual difference theorists and intersectional theorists whose work is\nanchored particularly in black feminist thought (Crenshaw 2019, Hill\nCollins and Bilge 2016 ), but also in contributions from theorists of bodily\nabilities and trans theorists. (Garland-Thomson 2002, Bettcher and Garry\n2009, Koyama 2006) These\ntheorists challenge the priority of sexual difference, in our accounts\nof embodied subjectivity, and the possibility of providing generic\naccounts of what such difference consists in. What counts as\nbeing a man or a woman, what life opportunities result from gendered\npositionality, and how these factors are internalized to form our\nlived experience of being gendered, is mediated by the other\ncategories which intersect with gendered ones. Being a “black\nman/woman”, or “gay man/woman”, or “trans\nman/woman” (themselves categories which also mediate each other\nand are mediated further by, for example, nationality, religion, age,\nclass and our positioning on the ability/disability axis), each has a\ndifferent content from being a “white, straight, middleclass,\ncis gendered, able bodied woman or man”. The normative ideals\nattached to the concepts are different, though also overlapping. These\npositionalities have consequences for our life opportunities both\neconomically and in the wider social realm, which the structural data\nmake evident. And all of this has consequences for our lived\nsubjectivity, how we experience our bodies, our sense of ourselves as\nmale or female, amongst other identifiers.  \nBlack feminist critiques challenge the racism of mainstream white\nfeminist thought for theorizing womanhood from the perspective of\nwhite women thereby rendering the particular experiences of black and\nother groups of marginalized women invisible. Audre Lorde writes: \nAs a Black lesbian feminist comfortable with the many ingredients of\nmy identity, and a woman committed to racial and sexual freedom of\nexpression, I find I am constantly being encouraged to pluck out some\naspect of myself and present this as a meaningful whole, eclipsing or\ndenying the other parts of self. But this is a destructive and\nfragmenting way to live. (Lorde 1984)  \nTwo centuries earlier Sojourner Truth, in her famous\n“Ain’t I a Woman” speech at Seneca Falls (see above)\nsignalled the very different modes of embodiment for black slave women\nand white bourgeois women. The coining of the term intersectionality\nis often accredited to African-American civil rights advocate and\nfeminist and critical race scholar, Kimberle Crenshaw (2019). As black\nwomen we do not experience racism AND sexism as separate discrete\nstrands of oppression, Crenshaw argues, but instead racism and sexism\nintersect and combine to shape the lives, including the experiences of\nembodiment, of black women, in very specific ways. This is not a\nmatter of adding on experiences of being raced to a foundational sexed\nidentity. What constitutes being a woman is inter-articulated with\nbeing black, in ways that challenge the universalism of sexual\ndifference theory. \nDisability theorists from the 1990s onwards explored how disability\naffected the gendering process and gender the experiences and outcomes\nof differing bodily abilities (Mairs 1990, Thomas 1999). Feminist\ntheory, as Garland-Thomson argues:  \ninterrogates how subjects are multiply interpellated; in other words,\nhow the representational systems of gender race, ethnicity, ability,\nsexuality and class mutually construct, inflect and contradict one\nanother. (2002: 3)  \nthe status of the lived body, the politics of appearance, the\nmedicalisation of the body, the privilege of normalcy (2002: 4)  \nall look different from the perspective of women regarded as disabled.\nAnd the relative privileges of normative femininity are often denied\nto these women. Such work by intersectional feminists challenge any\nfoundational role, or universal articulation of, sexed difference\nitself. \nFeminist writers from Wollstonecraft onwards have drawn attention to\nthe way in which society prescribes norms in relation to which\nsubjects regulate their own bodies and those of others.\nBeauvoir’s account of this has been highlighted above.\n“Our bodies are trained, shaped and impressed with the\nprevailing historical forms of … masculinity and\nfemininity” (Bordo 1993: 91). By regimes of dieting, makeup,\nexercise, dress, and cosmetic surgery, women, and increasingly men,\ntry to sculpt their bodies into shapes which reflect the dominant\nsocietal norms. Such disciplinary practices attach not only to the\nproduction of appropriately gendered bodies, but to other aspects of\nbodily identity subject to social normalization. Hair straightening,\nblue tinted contact lenses, surgical reconstruction of noses and lips,\nare practices in which the material shapes of our bodies are\ndisciplined to correspond to a social ideal, reflecting the privileged\nposition which certain kinds of, usually, white, always able, always\nyoung, bodies occupy. \nThis became a major theme in 1970s feminist writing. Dworkin writes:\n \nIn our culture not one part of a women’s body is left untouched,\nunaltered.… From head to toe, every feature of a woman’s\nface, every section of her body, is subject to modification. (1974:\n113–114)  \nFrom the 1990s, feminist attention to the power relations\nworking through such disciplinary practices has made extensive use of\nthe work of Foucault (Foucault 1975, Bartky 1990, Bordo 1993).\nFoucauldian insights regarding disciplinary practices of the body are\napplied to the disciplining of the gendered, and most insistently the\nfemale, body. Such accounts stress the way in which women actively\ndiscipline their own bodies not only to avoid social punishments, but\nalso to derive certain kinds of pleasure. There are two key features\nof such accounts. One stresses the way in which the material shape of\nbodies is modified by such practices. The second that such\nmodifications are a consequence of bodies carrying social meanings,\nsignalling within specific contexts, sexual desirability, or\navailability, or respectability, or participation in social groupings.\nWith attention to the work of Foucault and other poststructuralist\nwriters, also came the recognition that practices of bodily\nmodification could have multiple meanings, with disagreements over\nresponses to cosmetics, fashion and cosmetic surgery (Davis 1995, Alsop and Lennon 2018). It was against this\nbackground that Bordo (1993) developed her complex and influential\nreading of the anorexic body:  \nfemale slenderness … has a wide range of sometimes\ncontradictory meanings … suggesting powerlessness … in\none context, autonomy and freedom in the next. (1993: 26; see the\nEthics of Embodiment,\n section 8,\n below)  \nIn the work of Butler (1990, 1993, 2004), the subjection of our bodies\nto such normalizing practices become viewed, not only a way in which\nalready sexed bodies seek to approximate an ideal, but as the process\nwhereby sexed subjects come into existence at all. Here Butler is\nfollowing Beauvoir’s claim that we become\ndifferentiated as women and men, rather than being born as such. Since\n1990 with the appearance of Gender Trouble, her performative\naccount of gendered subjectivity has dominated feminist theory. Butler\nrejects the view that gender differences, with their accompanying\npresumptions of heterosexuality, have their origin in biological or\nnatural differences. She explores, instead, how such a\n“naturalising trick” is pulled off; asking by what means a\nunity of biology, gendered identification, and heterosexuality comes\nto appear natural. Butler, like Foucault, views discourses as\nproductive of the identities they appear to be describing. When a baby\nis born and the midwife says “it’s a girl” she is\nnot reporting an already determinate state of affairs, but taking part\nin a practice which constitutes that state of affairs. The effect of\nrepetition of acts of this kind is to make it appear that\nthere are two distinct natures, male and female. These gendered\nperformances are ones which we act out ourselves and which others act\nout in relation to us. They are acted out in accordance with social\nscripts prescribing ideals which are unrealizable, but which\nnone the less provide the framework for our activities. These dominant\nideals reinforce the power of certain groups; e.g., men and\nheterosexuals, over others. These others: women, gay people, trans and\ngender non-conforming people, those with differently abled bodies, or\nbodies differently shaped from the dominant ideal, are treated\nsocially as outsiders, “the abject”, and subject to social\npunishments. \nThe performances by means of which our bodies become gendered vary in\ndifferent contexts, and can change over time. Constituting myself as a\ncaring mother, my performance would differ from that of a sexy pop\nstar. Moreover these practices are not independent of those which\nproduce other aspects of our identity. Butler has stressed the way in\nwhich gendered performances incorporate a presumptive heterosexuality;\nbut, as intersectional theorists have made clear, they also are\nco-constituted with class, race and national and cultural positioning,\nas well as age and a variety of forms of abilities and disabilities.\nIn bodily acts manifesting gendered positionality, other social\npositions are carried along, in such a way that it is not possible to\ndisentangle a strand of gender which is universally present. \nIf gender becomes a matter of bodily style and performance, as this\nmodel suggests, then there is no necessary link between\ngender and any particular bodily shape. The alignment between\nanatomical shape and gendered performance is itself just a norm.\nFurthermore this norm, along with others governing gendered\nperformance, is open to destabilization and change. For Butler same\nsex practices are one way of destabilizing the normative links of\ngender and heterosexuality. Various trans performances, in a parallel\nway, challenge the link of anatomical shape and gender. The trans\ncommunity, problematised by sexual difference theory, therefore comes\nto occupy a central position for Butler. They are pivotal to the\nprocess of “queering” by means of which gender binaries,\nestablished by normalizing practices, are to be undermined and\nunravelled. So, for example, the television documentary, Pregnant\nMan by McDonald (2008), featuring a pregnant man who is referred\nto as a man and presented as a regular guy, works to undermine our\nbinaries. What remains problematic about this, however, is that the\neffect of performance is unpredictable. Drag, for example, can support\nor dislodge gendered stereotypes and we cannot always sort out which\nany instance will produce. This make possibilities for reflective\nagency difficult to negotiate (McNay 2000). \nFor some commentators such a performative account of the formation of\nsexed bodies, fails to capture how the materiality of the body enters\ninto our sense of self. In the preface to Bodies that Matter\nButler reports a common response to her work:  \nWhat about the materiality of the body, Judy? … an effort\n… to recall me to a bodily life that could not be theorized\naway … for surely bodies live and eat; eat and sleep; feel pain\nand pleasure; endure illness and violence; and these facts …\ncannot be dismissed as mere construction. (1993: ix)  \nButler answers such questions by giving an account of the materiality\nof the body in terms of a process of materialisation. Here\nshe is “calling into question the model of construction whereby\nthe social unilaterally acts on the natural and invests it …\nwith … meaning” (1993: 4). Instead she offers us a\npicture in which what we count as the material, as nature, as the\ngiven, is not something to which we have unmediated access. It is\nitself a product of particular modes of conceptualizing, modes which\ndo not escape the workings of power. “Sex posited as prior to\nconstruction will, by virtue of being posited, become the effect of\nthat very positing” (1993: 5). She concurs with the position of\nSpivak:  \nIf one thinks of the body as such, there is no possible outline of the\nbody as such. There are thinkings of the systematicity of the body,\nthere are value codings of the body. The body, as such, cannot be\nthought, and I certainly cannot approach it. (Spivak 1989) \nFor Butler, we have to think of matter in terms of “a process of\nmaterialisation that stabilises over time to produce the effect of\nboundary, fixity … we call matter” (1993: 9). We cannot,\nthen, ask questions about what limits are set by something outside of\nwhat we conceptualize. We can, however, explore the possibilities of\nconceptualizing otherwise. This does not mean that there is nothing\noutside of discourse. Butler makes clear that the body\nexceeds any attempt to capture it in discourse. It is just\nsuch excessiveness which allows the possibility of alternative\nformations of it, for the body outruns any of the ways we might have\nof thinking about it. But we cannot approach the extra-discursive\nexcept by exploring discursive possibilities. \nButler’s (1993) thinking together of the material and the\ndiscursive, has, however, been criticized, for not allowing the body\nmore of a drag on signification (Alaimo and Hekman 2008; Lennon and Alsop 2019). Such a “flight from\nthe material” according to Alaimo and Hekman, has foreclosed\nattention to “lived material bodies and evolving corporeal\npractices” (2008: 3). To correct such a deficit, in the\nframework of what is termed the new materialism, what is stressed\ninstead is that, although “language structures how we apprehend\nthe ontological, it doesn’t constitute it” (2008: 98). The\ninsight of the new materialist discussions has been to ensure that\nmatter, the material, is accorded an active role in this relation. \nFor Grosz, there is:  \nan elision of the question of nature and of matter in Butler’s\nwork. Mattering becomes more important than matter! Being\n“important”, having significance, having a place,\nmattering, is more important than matter, substance or materiality.\n(interview with Ausch, Doane, and Perez 2000)  \nIn Grosz’s own work such materiality is conceived of in terms of\n“active forces”. The body is involved in a process of\nactive “becoming” which outruns any account which might be\noffered of it within culture. In the same interview she claims:\n“Nature is … is openness, resource, productivity”.\nHere the body is not simply a materiality which outruns any attempt to\nconceptualize it; it is actively involved in processes of change and\ntransformation. Grosz’s recent work (1999 [2008]), exploring\nbiology and its relationship to culture, shows an increasing interest\nin unravelling the nature/culture opposition by a stress on “the\nvirtualities, the potentialities, within biological existence that\nenable cultural, social, and historical forces to work with and\ntransform that existence” (1999 [2008: 24]). Returning to the work of\nDarwin, she sees in his work “the genesis of the new from the\nplay of repetition and difference within the old” (2008: 28).\nNonetheless she draws some problematic conclusions which are not\nendorsed by current feminist biologists (Fausto-Sterling 2000; Fine\n2012, 2017). In embracing natural selection she appears to give it a\nfoundational explanatory role so that  \nlanguage, culture, intelligence, reason, imagination memory, -terms\ncommonly claimed as defining characteristics of the human and the\ncultural-are all equally effects of the same rigorous criteria of\nnatural selection. (Grosz 1999 [2008: 44])  \nMoreover within this process a binary sexual difference is required,\nas, “one of the ontological characteristics of life\nitself” (1999 [2008: 44]). And this sexual differentiation and the\nsexual selection with which, for her, it is interwoven, is then\ninvoked to ground racial and other forms of bodily differences. \nGrosz’s endorsement of a biology which renders the sexual binary\nunassailable, has been criticized for going beyond recognizing the\nimportance of the material, to privilege a particular biological\naccount of matter (Jagger 2015). The history of sex difference research show\nthat the biological theories, which give an account of sex\ndifferences, are the products of particular historical and culturally\nspecific moments of production. Such a recognition has allowed\nbiological accounts of sex differences to be revisited with an eye as\nto where cultural assumptions about gender have influenced them. Of\nkey importance in this regard has been the assumption that there are\nsimply two sexes, male and female, a model which has come\nincreasingly under challenge. Fausto-Sterling points out the range of\ninter-sex bodies that are forced into a binary classificatory system\n(1992, 2000). She points out that “the varieties are so diverse\n… that no classificatory scheme could do more than suggest the\nvariety of sexual anatomy encountered in clinical practice”\n(1993: 22). Oudshoorn (1994), in a genealogy of the emergence of the\ntheory of sex hormones, shows how a model of binary sex differences\nprevailed, in a context in which dualistic notions of male and female\ncould have been abandoned (see entry\n feminist philosophies of biology\n and also Fausto-Sterling 1992, 2000; Fine 2012, 2017). Lane argues\nthat  \nmobilizing a reading of biology as open-ended and creative, supports a\nperspective that sees sex and gender diversity as a continuum, rather\nthan a dichotomy—put simply, “nature” throws up all\nthis diversity and society needs to accept it. (2009: 137)  \nLane, as a trans theorist, is confronting what is seen as an\nanti-biologism within performative gender theory, and exploring the\ncomplex interpellation of biological and cultural factors in the\naetiology of trans subjectivity, without treating Grosz’s\nbiological account as authoritative (see entry on\n feminist perspectives on trans issues). \nThis is not to deny that there is something independent of our\nconceptualizations which sets constraints on what can be said about\nit. What we cannot do is disentangle the bit which is given\nfrom our ways of thinking about it. What needs addressing according to\nBarad is “the entanglement of matter and meaning” (Barad\n2007), the inter-implication of the discursive and the material in\nwhich no priority is given to either side. Barad explores this\nentanglement with particular reference to the work of physicist Niels\nBohr. Viewing matter as an active “agent” ensures that\nmatter and meaning are mutually articulated. Importantly, however,\nalthough the empirical world of matter takes an active part this does\nnot involve according it some sort of immediate givenness, or a\nstraight-forwardly determining role. In her approach Barad is\nfollowing in the footsteps of Haraway. In 1985, prior to\nButler’s Gender Trouble, Haraway had published her\n“Cyborg Manifesto” (1985 [1991]). Haraway’s project\nhad some overlap with that later articulated by Butler. She wished to\novercome the binary between nature and culture, replacing the two\nterms with nature/culture, in which different elements cannot\nbe disentangled. She was also concerned to draw attention to the\ncomplex factors which go into constituting what is to count as nature\nfor us. Most crucially she was concerned to undermine the supposed\nnaturalness of certain binaries; insisting on a breaching of\nboundaries between human and animal and between animal and machine. So\ncame her invocation of the cyborg: a creature\n“simultaneously animal and machine” populating a world\n“ambiguously natural and crafted” (1985 [1991: 149]). In\npointing to the cyborg as the figure which captures our “bodily\nreality”, Haraway is resisting any appeal to a pure nature which\nis supposed to constitute our bodily being. There is no clear boundary\nbetween what is natural and what is constructed. In Haraway’s\npicture, however, the body, along with the rest of the natural world,\nhas what she calls “a trickster quality that resists categories\nand projects of all kinds” (1997: 128). In this and her later\nwork (Haraway 2003, 2008), her account of the quirkiness and agency which, in\nButler, is primarily discussed as a feature of discursive practices,\nis as much a feature of nature. Nature is viewed as an agent, actively\ncontributing to the indivisible nature/culture with which we\nare faced. “We must find another relationship to nature besides\nreification, possession, appropriation and nostalgia” (2008:\n158). This other relation is to view nature as “a partner in the\npotent conversation” (2008: 158), in which we attempt to\nconstitute it. What is so notable about her work is the careful\nrespect shown to the concreteness of bodily existence and to the\nbiological narratives, alongside narratives of historical and cultural\nkinds. \nA return to an interest in feminist phenomenology, in the footsteps of\nBeauvoir, started with the work of Bartky and Young in the late 1970s,\nbut became widespread only in the 1990s. At the center of\nphenomenological accounts of embodiment is the lived experience of the\nbody. For such writers embodiment is our mode of\nbeing-in-the-world (Young 2005: 9). The notion of\nexperience is treated with great suspicion in the\npoststructuralist framework within which Butler is primarily\npositioned. The suspicion is a consequence of empiricist uses of the\nterm, in which experience is tied to a “myth of the given”\nwhereby body and world are offered to us in an unmediated way. The\nexperiences to which phenomenological writers draw attention are not,\nhowever, of such a pure kind. For they are experiences of bodies in\nsituations, in which it is impossible to disentangle so called\n“natural” and “social” elements. For as\nMerleau-Ponty points out,  \neverything is both manufactured and natural in man, as it were, in the\nsense that there is not a word, not a form of behaviour which does not\nowe something to purely biological being—and which at the same\ntime does not elude the simplicity of animal life. (1945 [1962: 189])\n \nHere there is an entanglement of nature/culture, matter and meaning,\nwhich parallels that insisted on by Haraway and Barad discussed above.\nBut the phenomenological accounts foreground lived experience of the\nbody in a way that is often absent from, what are now termed, the new\nmaterialist writings, (although it is foregrounded in the writings of\nsome trans theorists, see Salamon 2010). \nInterest in the phenomenology of embodiment is an attempt to further\narticulate Freud’s claim that “the ego is a bodily\nego” (Freud 1923 [1962]), to capture the way corporeal\ncharacteristics surface in our experiences of ourselves and others.\nFeminist writers such as Bartky, Young, Alcoff, Heinämaa, and\nWeiss are carrying on the project started by Beauvoir; but a major\ninfluence for many of them is also the work of Merleau-Ponty. They put\nsuch resources to work to make visible the variable experiences of\ngendered, raced, classed, differently abled and differently aged\nbodies, to reflect on the way such experiences, mediate social\npositionality, and constitute our sense of self.  \nIn a series of essays written early in her career, Young, (reprinted\n2005), captured everyday experiences of women’s embodiment. Such\naccounts were not simply descriptive, but were aimed, initially, to\nmake evident the way in which the social norms governing female\n“bodily comportment” yielded an inhibited\nintentionality, an interruption in the pre-reflexive engagement\nwith our environment to which Merleau-Ponty had drawn our attention\n(1945 [1962]). So, for example, in “Throwing Like A Girl”\n(1980) she points to studies which suggest that girls and boys throw\nin different ways and that women, when attempting physical tasks,\nfrequently fail to use the physical possibilities of their bodies.\nHere she is echoing the descriptions offered by Beauvoir. Also\nfollowing Beauvoir, Young suggests that the inhibited intentionality\ncharacteristic of female embodiment derives from the fact that women\noften experience their bodies as things/objects, “looked at and\nacted upon” (1980 [2005: 39]), as well as the source of\ncapacities. “She often lives her body as a burden, which must be\ndragged and prodded along, and at the same time protected” (1980\n[2005: 36]). For Young, as for Beauvoir, such experiences of\nembodiment are not a consequence of anatomy, but rather of the\nsituation of women in contemporary society, but they point to\nsignificant ways in which female lived embodiment can be an obstacle\nto intentional engagement with the world. \nOther of Young’s essays, for example, “Pregnant\nEmbodiment” (1984), “Breasted Experience” (2005, but\na shorter version in 1992) and “Menstrual Meditations” (2005a), focus\non distinctive aspects of female embodiment that yield distinct ways\nof being in the world. Here the stress is not only on inhibited\nintentionality. There is also recognition that such experiences can\noffer alternative possibilities for embodied engagement that can be\npositive as well as negative. In her accounts Young stresses that it\nis such everyday ordinary experiences of embodiment, variable\nas they are, that constitute women’s sense of their identity\nas women. Young develops this insight in a discussion of\nMoi’s suggestion that we should replace categories of both sex\nand gender with the category of the lived body. Moi (1999) suggests\nthat the category of the lived body can capture the way material\nfeatures of our bodies play a role in our subjective sense of self,\nwithout giving a reductionist, biological account of such\nembodiment. \nAlcoff points out that such phenomenological accounts “require a\ncross-indexing by cultural and ethnic specificity” (Alcoff 2006:\n107). In her work a phenomenological account is employed to give an\naccount of those identity categories which are anchored in material\nbodily features, what she terms visible identities. Alcoff is\noffering an account which integrates social identity categories with\npeople’s experiences of the bodies of themselves and others.\nFocusing primarily on raced and gendered identities, she makes clear\nthe way in which bodily features, (color, hair, nose, breasts,\ngenitals) are invested with a significance which becomes a part of our\nimmediate perceptual experience of them:  \nBoth race and sex … are most definitely physical, marked on and\nthrough the body, lived as a material experience, visible as surface\nphenomena and determinant of economic and political status. (2006:\n102)  \nBecause of the material reality of the features and the immediacy of\nour perceptual response, the meanings attached to such features become\nnaturalized. The fact that they are the product of learned modes of\nperception is not evident to us, for such perceptual practices have\nbecome habitual and are resistant to change. She points out how\n“race and gender consciousness produce habitual bodily\nmannerisms that feel natural and become unconscious after long\nuse” (2006: 108). \nThe significance, therefore, of certain bodily shapes, informs our\nsense of our own body and of the bodies of others. The sense of our\nown body reflects, as was articulated by Sartre, Fanon, and Beauvoir,\nthe way it is perceived by others. The very shape of the body carries\nits position in patterns of social interaction. In a striking example\nregarding raced physiognomies, Alcoff quotes from Rodriguez’s\nbook Days of Obligation (1992):  \nI used to stare at the Indian in the mirror. The wide nostrils\n… the thick lips …. Such a long face—such a long\nnose—sculpted by indifferent, blunt thumbs, and of such common\nclay. No one in my family had a face as dark or as Indian as mine.\nMy face could not portray the ambition I brought to it.\n(Alcoff 2006: 189; my emphasis)  \nAmbition is something expressible in a body of a different kind, and\nthe face he looks at points to a positioning at odds with what he\ndesires. Although Alcoff restricts her analysis to race and sex, it is\nclear that it also has relevance to other bodily identities. The body\nin the wheelchair has similar difficulty expressing physical prowess\nthat Rodriguez’s has of expressing ambition. Lennon and Alsop\n(2019, Ch. 7) point out, that such a framework makes sense of the\ndesires of some trans people for corporeal transformation. For\nexperiences of material features of the body are foundational to our\nsense of our sexed identity and used by others to position us in\npatterns of social interaction. Despite the polarising and often\ndamaging consequences of the perceptual practices which Alcoff draws\nour attention to, she remains optimistic about the possibilities for\nchange, though stressing the difficulties of even bringing these\npractices into view. Such changes require that people are brought to\nviewexpereince their own bodies and the bodies of others in a\ndifferent way: “perceptual practices are dynamic even when\ncongealed into habit … people are capable of change”\n(Alcoff 2006: 189). \nAlcoff is drawing attention to the salience which particular bodily\nfeatures have in our experiencing of our own bodies and the bodies of\nothers. This links her work to that of other theorists who explore\nthis relation with reference to the notions of both “body\nimage” and “bodily imaginaries”. Weiss (1999) begins\nher exploration of body images with the work of Merleau-Ponty (1945\n[1962]) and Schilder (1935 [1950]), though castigating both for\nignoring the difference that sexed and raced positionality make. For\nMerleau-Ponty our body image or body schema is the awareness we have\nof the shape or form of our body: “my posture in the\ninter-sensory world, a form” (Weiss, 10). Such an awareness is\nnot as of an objective anatomical body, but the body in the face of\nits tasks, a body in which some aspects stand out and others are\ninvisible. It is by means of such body schemas that we are able to act\nintentionally in the world, and, although they most commonly operate\nat a pre-reflective level, they constitute our sense of ourselves as\ncorporeal beings. In the work of Schilder the multiple nature of such\nbody images and their dynamic nature is stressed. For him the\nphenomenological account is interwoven with a psychoanalytic one. Our\ncorporeal or postural schema is formed, in part, by the emotional and\nimaginative significance which is given to parts of the body by our\npersonal relations with others, and by the significance attached to\ncorporeal features in the social domain: “the touches of others,\nthe interest others take in the different parts of our body, will be\nof enormous importance in the postural model of the body” (Weiss\n1999: 16). This, ensures that our body image is formed by the way the\nbody is experienced and emotionally invested rather than\ncognitively represented. This is what for many writers is captured by\nthe notion of the bodily imaginary. (Gatens 1996, Lennon 2015).\nFeminists employing the concept of the bodily imaginary,(influenced by\nthe work of Irigaray discussed above), therefore, stress that the way\nwe have of experiencing our bodies invests particular contours with\nemotional and affective salience. Gatens (1996), in exploring the\nnotion of bodily imaginaries, also draws on the work of Spinoza. For\nher the imaginary body is  \nthe social and personal significance of the body as\n“lived”, socially and historically specific in that it is\nconstructed by a shared language … and common institutional\npractices. (1996: 11–12) \nMany of the emotional saliencies which are attached, socially or only\nindividually, to specific bodily features are damaging and\ndestructive. There are many damaging imaginaries of women’s\nbodies, gay bodies, black bodies, or those imagined as disabled. It\ntherefore seems imperative that such ways of thinking/feeling specific\ncorporeal features can be subject to change. The matter becomes\ncomplex once we recognize that the affective salience which our bodies\nbear may not be available to reflective scrutiny, but nonetheless\nreveals itself in the habitual perceptual practices to which Alcoff\ndrew our attention. To effect change we need to offer alternative\npictures which make emotional (imaginative) and not only cognitive\nsense. This is a crucial issue for all writers who want to provide an\naccount of corporeal identities in terms of affectively laden body\nimages, or bodily imaginaries. We can see this process at work in the\nrewriting of the female body offered by Irigaray, and in the\nre-imagining of the black body which we find in writers such as hooks,\nwhere the skin of the man lying next to her, “soot black like my\ngrand-daddy’s skin” can return her to “a world where\nwe had a history … a world where … something wonderful\nmight be a ripe tomato, found as we walked through the rows of Daddy\nJerry’s garden” (hooks 1990: 33; see also Tate 2009).\nFeminist theorists of the body, working with the notion of the bodily\nimaginary, therefore see creative acts directed at alterations in our\nmode of perceiving bodies, as central to the process of political and\nsocial transformation. (Lennon 2015). \nThe work on bodily imaginaries from within the phenomenological\nframework, makes explicit the extent to which our embodied identities\nare dependent on the responses of others. They are negotiated\nintersubjectively, linked to the possible pattern of social\ninteractions within which we can recognizably be placed. It is also\nclear that the imaginaries which are normatively attached to certain\nbodily morphologies can be restricting and damaging. Both Beauvoir and\nFanon described the damaging consequences of encountering the myths\nand images carried by female and black bodies, which become\ninternalized to mediate our embodied sense of self. The work of many\ntheorists of bodily abilities point to the norms surrounding bodily\nshape and form in relation to which non normative bodies are seen as\nfreaks and monsters. (Garland-Thomson 1997). Mairs admits experiencing\nshame of her body:  \nit is a crippled body. Thus it is doubly other, not merely by the\n… standards of patriarchal culture but by the standards of\nphysical desirability erected for everybody in our world…. My\nbelly sags from loss of muscle tone, which also creates all kind of\nintestinal disruptions, hopelessly humiliating in a society in which\nexcretory functions remain strictly unspeakable. (Mairs 1990 [1997:\n299, 301])  \nThe way Mairs experiences her body is formed in relation to\nnormalizing discourses in which the “crippled” body, in\nparticular the “desiring crippled body”, is banished to\nthe realm of the rejected, often unthinkable, other. The blossoming of\nthe aesthetic surgery industry amongst women, and increasingly men, is\na consequence of an increasingly narrow set of bodily morphologies\nbeing accepted as attractive and desirable, Moreover these\nmorphologies are usually of young bodies. This fuels the demand for\nbody modification of aging bodies. (Alsop and Lennon 2018; Dolezal\n2015; Gilman 1999; Heyes and Jones 2009). \nAs a consequence of these insights, there is increasing work amongst\nfeminist philosophers concerning the ethics of embodiment.\nWeiss (2015) points to  \nspecific feminist philosophers, critical race scholars, and disability\ntheorists who … illustrate, and ultimately combat, the\ninsidious ways in which sexism, racism, and “compulsory\nable-bodiedness” (McRuer 2006), impoverish the lived experience\nof both oppressors and the oppressed, largely by predetermining the\nmeaning of their bodily interactions in accordance with\ninstitutionalized cultural expectations and norms. (2015: 77)  \nThere are two special issues of the feminist journal Hypatia\n(Bergoffen and Weiss 2011, 2012) devoted to the ethics of embodiment,\ndealing with the implications of situating bodies at the center of\nethical theory. This requires looking at the operation of bodily\nnorms, and which bodies and modes of comportment are valued and which\nnot. It also requires engaging with bodily vulnerability in relation\nto the normative human and ethical ideals of autonomy and subjecthood.\nGarland-Thomson discusses what she terms “misfitting”, a\nlack of fit between body and world and between our bodies and other\npeoples (2011, also Bergoffen and Weiss 2011). When we fit\nharmoniously and properly into the world, we forget the contingency of\nthis, because the world sustains us.  \nWhen we experience misfitting and recognize that disjuncture for its\npolitical potential, we expose the relational component and the\nfragility of fitting. Any of us can fit here today and misfit there\ntomorrow. (Garland-Thomson 2011: 597) \nOur bodily vulnerability, and consequently our vulnerability to\nothers, is also central to the later work of Butler. It is through the\nbody that we become vulnerable to our material environment and to the\nviolence which may be inflicted on us by others: “living in a\nworld of beings who are …physically dependent on one another,\nphysically vulnerable to one another” (2004: 22). The\nvulnerability to social punishments and the threats of violence attach\nparticularly to those who fail to conform to social norms. But Butler\nstresses the vulnerability and precariousness of everyone’s\nsubjectivity, formed as it is by public systems of meaning which are\nthemselves precarious and crisscrossed by differences. We are affected\nby the outside, the social and familial bonds, which enable us to\nassume subjectivity and agency, but are also injurious to us in\nclosing down possibilities for our ways of being.  \nI am affected not just by this one other or set of others, but by a\nworld in which humans, institutions and organic and inorganic\nprocesses all impress themselves upon this me, who is, at the onset,\nsusceptible in ways that are radically involuntary. (2015: 6/7)  \nSuch susceptibility is for her, the mode of being of embodied\nsensibility. (See Gonzalez-Arnal, Jagger and Lennon (eds.) 2012, for\npapers highlighting the distinctiveness of different modes of\nembodiment and the vulnerability of the body to pain and assault.
