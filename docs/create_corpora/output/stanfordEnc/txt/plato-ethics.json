That is to say, happiness or\nwell-being (eudaimonia) is the highest aim of moral thought\nand conduct, and the virtues (aretê:\n‘excellence’) are the requisite skills and dispositions\nneeded to attain it. If Plato’s conception of happiness is\nelusive and his support for a morality of happiness seems somewhat\nsubdued, there are several reasons. First, he nowhere defines the\nconcept or makes it the direct target of investigation, but introduces\nit in an oblique way in the pursuit of other questions. Second, the\ntreatment of the human good varies in the different dialogues, so that\nreaders find themselves confronted with the problem of what to make of\nthe discrepancies in different works. This touches on a fundamental\nproblem with Plato’s work – namely whether to follow a\n‘unitarian’, ‘revisionist’, or\n‘developmentalist’ approach to Plato’s writings.\nWhereas unitarians regard the dialogues as pieces of one mosaic, and\ntake the view that Plato in essence maintains a unified doctrine from\nhis earliest to his latest works, revisionists maintain that\nPlato’s thought underwent a fundamental transformation later in\nhis life, while ‘developmentalist’ hold that Plato’s\nviews evolved significantly throughout his career. While revisionism\nhas lost its impact in recent years, developmentalism has gained in\ninfluence. Although there is no unanimity, few unitarians deny\nnowadays that the character of Plato’s early, middle, and late\nworks differ in style, language, scope and content, as is to be\nexpected in a philosopher who worked for more than fifty years. Most\ndevelopmentalists, in turn, agree that it is impossible to line up\nPlato’s works like pearls on a string and to reconstruct his\nprogress from dialogue to dialogue; for example, where the views\nexpressed in different dialogues seem to disagree there may be\ncomplementation or supplementation at work, rather than divergence.\nGiven that Plato never speaks in his own voice, it is important to\ntake note of who the interlocutors are and what role is assigned to\nSocrates, if he is the main speaker. Plato’s dialogues should\nnever be treated in isolation when it comes to the reconstruction of\nhis doctrine; but even the comparison and contrasting of ideas\npresented in different dialogues is not a sure recipe for interpreting\nthis elusive thinker’s views. \n\n\nPlato’s so-called ‘Socratic’ dialogues share certain\ncharacteristics as a group. They are short interrogations by Socrates\nof the kind indicated in his explanation of his divine mission in the\nApology. They seem designed to undermine unquestioned\ntraditional views and values rather than to develop positive accounts,\nalthough they sometimes contain indications that seeming dead ends are\nnot real dead ends. The positive accounts contained in the middle\ndialogues – the so-called ‘Platonic’ dialogues\n– that are grouped around the Republic – treat\nhappiness in different ways as a state of perfection. The exact nature\nof this state is not easy to pinpoint, however, because it is based on\nmetaphysical presuppositions that are, at least prima facie, both hazy\nand out of the realm of ordinary understanding. There is not, as there\nis in Aristotle, an explicit determination of happiness as a\nself-sufficient state of the active individual. Instead, at least in\nsome texts, Plato’s moral ideals appear both austere and\nself-abnegating: The soul is to remain aloof from the pleasures of the\nbody in the pursuit of higher knowledge, while communal life demands\nthe subordination of individual wishes and aims to the common good.\n\n\n\nThe difficulties of assessing Plato’s ethical thought are\ncompounded by the fact that the metaphysical underpinnings seem to\nhave changed during his long life. In the Socratic dialogues, there\nare no indications that the search for virtue and the human good goes\nbeyond the human realm. This changes with the middle dialogues, which\nshow a growing interest in an all-encompassing metaphysical grounding\nof knowledge, a development that leads to the positing of the\n‘Forms’ as the true nature of all things, culminating in\nthe Form of the Good as the transcendent principle of all goodness.\nThough the theory of the Forms is not confined to human values, but\nencompasses the whole of nature, Plato in the middle dialogues seems\nto assume no more than an analogy between human affairs and cosmic\nharmony. The late dialogues, by contrast, display a growing tendency\nto assume a unity between the microcosm of human life and the\nmacrocosmic harmonic order of the entire universe, a tendency that is\ndisplayed most fully in the Philebus and the\nTimaeus. While these holistic tendencies appeal to the\nimagination because they rely on harmonic relations expressed in\nmathematical proportions, the metaphysical status of the Forms is even\nharder to make out in the late dialogues than in the middle dialogues.\nThough Plato’s late works do not show any willingness to lower\nthe standards of knowledge as such, Plato acknowledges that his design\nof a rational cosmic order is based on conjecture and speculation, an\nacknowledgement that finds its counterpart in his more pragmatic\ntreatment of ethical standards and political institutions in his\nlatest politcal work, the Laws. Finally, at no stage of his\nphilosophy does Plato go into a systematic treatment of, or and\ncommitment to, basic principles of ethics from which rules and norms\nof human interaction can be derived and justified. Instead, Plato\nlargely confines himself to the depiction of the good soul and of what\nis good for the soul, on the assumption that the state of the soul is\nthe necessary and sufficient condition for the good life and its moral\nprecepts. This abstemiousness explains the widely diverging\nreconstructions of Plato’s ethics in the secondary literature\nfrom antiquity to this day.\n\nIf ethics is widely regarded as the most accessible branch of\nphilosophy, it is so because many of its presuppositions are\nself-evident or trivial truths: All human actions, for example, serve\nsome end or purpose; whether they are right or wrong depends on an\nactor’s overall aims. At least for secularists, the attainment\nof these overall aims is thought to be a condition or prerequisite for\na good life. What we regard as a life worth living depends on the\nnotion we have of our own nature and of the conditions of its\nfulfillment. This, in turn, is determined, at least in part, by the\nvalues and standards of the society we live in. Personal ends and\npurposes depend in each case not only on reason, but also on the\nindividual agents’ dispositions (i.e.their likes and dislikes,\nwhich determine their personal character). The attainment of these\nends can also depend at least in part on external factors, such as\nhealth, material prosperity, social status, and even on good looks or\nsheer luck. \nAlthough these presuppositions may appear to be self-evident, most of\nthe time, human beings are aware of them only implicitly, because many\nindividuals simply lead their lives in accordance with pre-established\nstandards and values that are, under normal circumstances, not objects\nof reflection. It is only in times of crisis that a society’s\ntraditions and precepts are challenged by someone like Socrates, who\nsees the need to disturb his fellows’ complacency. The\nhistorical Socrates was, of course, not the first to question the\nGreek way of life. Presocratic philosophers such as Heraclitus or\nXenophanes had been critics of their times, and the sophists had\nargued provocatively that, contrary to the naïve view, it is\ncustom and convention, rather than nature that set the standards for\nwhat is deemed right or wrong, good or bad, in every society. But if\nother thinkers had preceded Socrates with moral and social criticism,\nhe was certainly the first to challenge his fellows on an individual\nbasis on the ground that ‘the unexamined life is not worth\nliving’ (Ap. 38a). Whatever position one may take in\nthe controversy concerning the degree to which Plato’s early\ndialogues are true to the historical Socrates’ discussions, the\nindependent testimony of Xenophon leaves little doubt that\nSocrates’ cross-examinations (elenchos) provoked the\nkind of enmity that led to his conviction and execution. In the eyes\nof conservative Athenians, Socrates’ questioning undermined the\ntraditional values of their society. As Socrates saw it, the\n‘virtues’ – which is to say the social skills,\nattitudes, and character-traits possessed by most Athenian citizens of\nhis time – were all too often geared towards their\npossessors’ wealth, power, and capacities for self-indulgence,\nto the detriment of public morality and the community’s\nwell-being. \nThe Socratic legacy prompted Plato to engage in a thorough examination\nof the nature of knowledge and reality, an examination that gradually\ntook him far beyond the scope of the historical Socrates’\ndiscussions. Nevertheless, Plato continued to present his\ninvestigations as dialogues between Socrates and some partner or\npartners. And Plato preserved the dialogical form even in those of his\nlate works where Socrates is replaced by a stand-in and where the\ndidactic nature of the presentations is hard to reconcile with the\npretense of live discussion. But these didactic discourses continue to\ncombine questions of ethical, political, social, or psychological\nimportance with metaphysical, methodological and epistemological\nconsiderations, and it can be just as hard to assess the extent to\nwhich Plato agrees with the pronouncements of his speakers, as it is\nwhen the speaker is Socrates. Furthermore, the fact that a certain\nproblem or its solution is not mentioned in a dialogue does not mean\nthat Plato was unaware of it. There is, therefore, no certainty\nconcerning the question: “What did Plato see and when did he\nfirst see it?” The lack of information about the order in which\nPlato wrote his works adds to this difficulty. It stands to reason,\nhowever, that he started with the short dialogues that question\ntraditional virtues – courage, justice, moderation, piety. It\nalso stands to reason that Plato gradually widened the scope of his\ninvestigations, by reflecting not only on the social and political\nconditions of morality, but also on the logical, epistemological, and\nmetaphysical presuppositions of a successful moral theory. These\ntheoretical reflections often take on a life of their own. Several of\nPlato’s later works address ethical problems only marginally or\nnot at all. The Parmenides, the Theaetetus, and the\nSophist deal primarily or exclusively with epistemological\nand metaphysical problems of a quite general nature. Nevertheless, as\nwitnessed by the Philebus, the Statesman, the\nTimaeus, and the Laws, Plato never lost interest in\nthe question of what conditions are necessary for a good human\nlife. \nThe early ‘Socratic’ dialogues are not concerned with the\nquestion of the good life and its conditions in general, but rather\nwith particular virtues. Socrates explores the individual virtues\nthrough a discussion with persons who are either representatives of,\nor claim to be experts on, that virtue. Socrates’ justification\nfor this procedure is that a paragon or expert must know the\ncharacteristic property of a particular virtues, and therefore be able\nto give an account or definition of it (cf. Xenophon\nMemorabilia I, 10; 16). Thus, in the Euthyphro,\nSocrates discusses piety with an ‘expert’ on religious\naffairs. In the Laches, he discusses courage with two\nrenowned generals of the Peloponnesian war, Laches and Nicias.\nSimilarly, in the Charmides Socrates addresses—somewhat\nironically—the nature of moderation with the two of the Thirty\nTyrants, namely the then very young Charmides, an alleged model of\nmodesty, and his guardian and intellectual mentor, Critias. In the\nGreater Hippias Socrates raises the question of the nature of\nthe beautiful with a producer of ‘beautiful things’, the\nsophist and polymath Hippias. In the Protagoras Socrates\nfocuses on the question of the unity of virtue in a discussion with\nProtagoras, the most famous teacher of ‘civic virtues’\namong the sophists. And in the Gorgias Socrates discusses the\nnature of rhetoric and its relation to virtue with the most prominent\nteacher of rhetoric among the sophists. Finally, in the Meno\nthe question how virtue is acquired is raised by Meno, a disciple of\nGorgias, and an ambitious seeker of power, wealth, and fame.\nSocrates’ interlocutors are usually at first quite confident\nabout their own competence in the discussion. Nor is such confidence\nunreasonable. If virtue is a kind of ‘skill’ or special\nproperty that enjoys general recognition, its possessor should know\nand be able to give an account of his skill. As the Socrates’\nexaminations demonstrate, however, such self-confidence is usually\nmisplaced and the ‘knowledge’ professed by Socrates’\nconversation partners is frequently revealed to be at best an implicit\nfamiliarity, When they are confronted with their inability to explain\nthe nature of their cherished virtue or expertise, they end up\nadmitting their ignorance, often with considerable chagrin and anger.\n \nSocrates’ purpose in conducting these sometimes cruel-looking\ngames is not just to undermine the false confidence of his\ninterlocutors, but also to arrive at formal definitions and standards\nconcerning the virtues. There were no widely acknowledged standards of\ndefinition in Socrates’ time, but by exposing the flaws in his\npartners’ abortive arguments in his investigations Socrates\ncontributed significantly to the establishment of such standards.\nThese flaws vary greatly in kind and gravity: Socrates shows that\nenumerations of examples are not sufficient to capture the nature of\nthe thing in question. Definitions that consist in the replacement of\na given concept with a synonym are open to the same objections as the\noriginal definition. Definitions may be hopelessly vague or miss the\nmark entirely, which is to say that they may be either too wide, and\ninclude unwanted characteristics or subsets, or too narrow, and\nexclude essential characteristics. Moreover, definitions may be\nincomplete because the object in question does not constitute a\nunitary phenomenon. If generally accepted ‘social\nexcellences’ are not simple conditions, they may be subject to\nconflicting convictions. Examples of all these flaws are provided in\nPlato’s early dialogues, where Socrates exposes the exact nature\nof the underlying deficiencies with more or less diagnostic\ntransparency. \nGiven that the focus in the early dialogues is almost entirely on the\nexposure of flaws and inconsistencies, one cannot help wondering\nwhether Plato himself knew the answers to his queries, and\nhad some cards up his sleeve that he chose not to play for the time\nbeing. This would presuppose that Plato had not only a clear notion of\nthe nature of the different virtues, but also a positive conception of\nthe good life as such. Since Plato was neither a moral nihilist nor a\nsceptic, he cannot have regarded moral perplexity (aporia) as\nthe ultimate end, nor regarded continued mutual examination, \nSocratico more, as a way of life for everyone. Perplexity, as is\nargued in the Meno, is just a wholesome intermediary stage on\nthe way to knowledge (Me. 84a–b). But if Plato assumes\nthat the convictions that survive Socratic questioning will eventually\ncoalesce into an account of the good life, then he keeps this\nexpectation to himself. Nor would such optimism seem warranted, given\nSocrates’ disavowal of knowledge. There is no guarantee that\nonly false convictions are discarded in a Socratic investigation,\nwhile true ones are retained. For, promising suggestions are often as\nmercilessly discarded as their less promising brethren. Perhaps Plato\ncounted on his readers’ intelligence to straighten out what is\nskewed in Socratic refutations, and also to detect unfair moves, and\nto supplement what is missing. It is, in fact, often not difficult to\nmake out fallacies in Socrates’ argument and to correct them;\nbut such corrections must remain incomplete without sufficient\ninformation about Plato’s overall conception of the good life\nand its moral presuppositions. It is therefore a matter of conjecture\nwhether Plato himself held any positive views while he composed one\naporetic dialogue after the other. He may have regarded his\ninvestigations as experimental stages, or have seen each dialogue as\nan element in a network of approaches that he hoped to eventually\nintegrate. \nIf there is a general lesson to be drawn from the many failed accounts\nof the virtues by Socrates’ different conversation partners,\nbeyond the particular shortcomings of individual definitions and\nassertions, it is that isolated definitions of single virtues, summed\nup in one sentence, will not do. The evidence that Plato already\nwanted his readers to draw this very conclusion in his early dialogues\nis somewhat contradictory, however. Plato famously pleads for the\nunity of the virtues in the Protagoras, and seems intent to\nreduce them all to knowledge. Scholars are therefore wont to speak of\nthe ‘intellectualistic’ character of the so-called\n‘Socratic ethics’, because it leaves no room for other\nmotivational forces, such as emotions or desires. Socrates’\nproof in the Protagoras that reason cannot be overcome by the\npassions has, from Aristotle on, been treated as a denial of\nakrasia, of the phenomenon that was later somewhat\nmisleadingly dubbed as ‘weakness of the will’. This\nintellectualizing tendency, however, does not tell us what kind of\nmaster-science would fulfill all of the requirements for defining\nvirtues, and what its content should be. What is more, the emphasis on\nknowledge does not rule out an awareness on Plato’s part of the\nimportance of other factors, even in his early dialogues. Though Plato\noften compared the virtues with technical skills, such as those of a\ndoctor or a pilot, he may have realized that virtues also involve\nemotional attitudes, desires, and preferences, but not yet have seen a\nclear way to coordinate or relate the rational and the affective\nelements that constitute the virtues. In the Laches, for\ninstance, Socrates partners struggle when they try to define courage,\ninvoking two different elements. In his attempt to define courage as\nsteadfastness in battle, Laches, one of the two generals and\n‘experts’ on courage, is faced with the dilemma that\nsteadfastness seems not to be a satisfactory definition of courage\neither in itsself or in combination with knowledge (La.\n192a–194c). His comrade Nicias, on the other hand, fails when he\ntries to identify courage exclusively as a certain type of knowledge\n(197e–200a). The investigation of moderation in the\nCharmides, likewise, points up that there are two disparate\nelements commonly associated with that virtue – namely, a\ncertain calmness of temper on the one hand (Chrm.\n158e–160d) and self-knowledge on the other (166e–175a). It\nis clear that a complex account would be needed to combine these two\ndisparate factors. For moral skills not only presuppose sufficient\n‘operative’ rationality but also require appropriate\nevaluative and emotional attitudes towards the desirable ends to be\nattained and the means to be employed. Such an insight is at least\nindicated in Socrates’ long and passionate argument in the\nGorgias against Polus and Callicles that the just life is\nbetter for the soul of its possessor than the unjust life, an argument\nthat he fortifies with a mythical depiction of the soul’s reward\nand punishment after death (523a–527e). But the nature of\njustice and what is required for the proper care of one’s soul,\nis thereby illuminated only indirectly. For the most part,\nSocrates’ interrogations focus on the incompatibility of his\ninterlocutor’ selfish aims with their more selfless and noble\nviews. In his earlier dialogues, Plato may or may not already be\nenvisaging the kind of solution that he is going to present in the\nRepublic to the problem of the relationship between the\nvarious virtues, with wisdom, the only intellectual virtue, as their\nbasis. Courage, moderation, and justice presuppose a certain\nsteadfastness of character as well as a harmony of purpose among the\ndisparate parts of the soul, but their goodness depends entirely on\nthe intellectual part of the soul, just as the virtue of the citizens\nin the just state depends on the wisdom of the philosopher kings\n(R. 428a–444e). The dispositional or\n‘demotic’ virtues are thus acknowledged but relegated to\nsecond place (500d; 522a–b). \nThere are at least some indications that Plato already saw the need\nfor a holistic conception of the good life when he composed his\n‘Socratic’ dialogues. At the end of the Laches,\nhe lets Nicias founder in his attempt to define courage as the\n‘knowledge of what is to be feared and what should inspire\nconfidence’. Nicias is forced to admit that such knowledge\npresupposes the knowledge of good and bad tout court\n(La. 199c–e). In a different but related way, Socrates\nalludes to a comprehensive knowledge at the end of the\nCharmides, in his final refutation of Critias’\ndefinition of moderation as ‘knowledge of knowledge’, by\nurging that this type of knowledge is insufficient for the happy life\nwithout the knowledge of good and bad (Chrm. 174b–e).\nBut pointing out what is wrong and missing in particular arguments is\na far cry from a philosophical conception of the good and the bad in\nhuman life. The fact that Plato insists on the shortcomings of a\npurely ‘technical’ conception of virtue suggests that he\nwas at least facing up to these problems. The discussion of the\n‘unity of the virtues’ in the Protagoras –\nregardless of the perhaps intentionally unsatisfactory structure of\nhis proofs – confirms that Plato realized that a critique of the\ninconsistencies implied in conventional values is insufficient to\njustify such a unitary point of view. But the evidence that Plato\nalready had a definitive conception of the good life in mind when he\nwrote his earlier dialogues remains, at most, indirect. \nA reflection on the meaning of Socrates’ quest for definitions\nin the early dialogues suggests that Plato cannot have been blind to\nthe sterility of a purely negative way of argument, or if he was blind\nat first, his blindness cannot have lasted long. For Socrates’\nquest for definitions has important consequences. First and foremost,\ndefinitions presuppose that there is a definable object; that is to\nsay, that it must have a stable nature. Nothing can be defined whose\nnature changes all the time. In addition, the object in question must\nbe a unitary phenomenon, even if its unity may be complex. If\ndefinitions are to provide the basis of knowledge, they require some\nkind of essentialism. This presupposition is indeed made explicit in\nthe Euthyphro, where Plato employs for the first time the\nterminology that will be characteristic of his full-fledged theory of\nthe Forms. In response to Euthyphro’s enumeration of various\nexamples of pious behavior, Socrates demands an account of the\none feature (Euthphr. 5d: idea; 6d:\neidos; 6e: paradeigma) that is common to all cases\nof what is holy or pious. Despite this pregnant terminology, few\nscholars nowadays hold that the Euthyphro already presupposes\ntranscendent Forms in a realm of their own– models that are\nincompletely represented by their imitations under material\nconditions. The terms eidos and idea preserved their\noriginal meaning of ‘look’ or ‘shape’ into the\nclassical age; but they were also often used in the more abstract\nsense of ‘form’, ‘sort’, ‘type’,\nor ‘kind’. No more than piety or holiness in the abstract\nsense seems to be presupposed in the discussion of the\nEuthyphro. There is, at any rate, no mention here of any\nseparation of a sensible and an intelligible realm, let alone of an\nexistence of ‘the holy itself’, as an entity existing in\nsplendid isolation from all particular cases of holiness. \nThe passage in the Euthyphro where Socrates asks Euthyphro to\nidentify the one feature that is common to all that is holy or pious\nmakes intelligible, however, the reason why Plato felt encouraged to\ndevelop the idea of transcendent Forms in dialogues that no longer\nconfine themselves to the ‘negative’ approach of\nquestioning the foundations or premises of other people’s\nconvictions. The requisite unity and invariance of entities such as\n‘the holy’, ‘ the beautiful’, ‘the\njust’ or ‘the equal’, necessarily prompts\nreflections on their ontological status and on the appropriate means\nof access to them. Given that they are the objects of definition and\nthe models of their ordinary representatives, there is every reason\nnot only to treat them as real, but also to assign to them a state of\nhigher perfection. And once this step has been taken, it is only\nnatural to make certain epistemological adjustments. For, access to\nparadigmatic entities is not to be expected through ordinary\nexperience, but presupposes some special kind of intellectual insight.\nIt seems, then, that once Plato had accepted invariant and unitary\nobjects of thought as the objects of definition, he was predestined to\nfollow the path that let him adopt a metaphysics and epistemology of\ntranscendent Forms. The alternative of treating these objects as mere\nconstructs of the mind that more or less fit the manifold of everyday\nexperience, clearly was not to Plato’s taste. It would have\nmeant the renunciation of the claim to unassailable knowledge and\ntruth in favor of belief, conjecture, and, horribile dictu,\nof human convention. The very fact that mathematics was already an\nestablished science with rigorous standards and unitary and invariant\nobjects must have greatly enhanced Plato’s confidence in\napplying the same standards to moral philosophy. It led him to search\nfor models of morality beyond the limits of everyday experience. This,\nin turn, explains the development of his theory of recollection and\nthe postulate of transcendent immaterial objects as the basis of\nreality and thought that he refers to in the Meno, and that\nhe presents more fully in the Phaedo. \nWe do not know when, precisely, Plato adopted this mode of thought,\nbut it stands to reason that his contact with the Pythagorean school\non his first voyage to Southern Italy and Sicily around 390 BC played\na major role in this development. Mathematics as a model-science has\nseveral advantages. It deals with unchangeable entities that have\nunitary definitions. It also makes a plausible claim that the essence\nof these entities cannot be comprehended in isolation but only in a\nnetwork of interconnections that have to be worked out at the same\ntime as each particular entity is defined. For instance, to understand\nwhat it is to be a triangle, it is necessary – inter\nalia – to understand the nature of points, lines, planes\nand their interrelations. That Plato was aware of this fact is\nindicated by his somewhat prophetic statement in his introduction of\nthe theory of recollection in the Meno, 81d: “As the\nwhole of nature is akin, and the soul has learned everything, nothing\nprevents a man, after recalling one thing only – a process men\ncall learning – discovering everything else for himself, if he\nis brave and does not tire of the search; for searching and learning,\nare, as a whole, recollection (anamnesis).” The\nsomewhat mystifying claim of an ‘overall kinship’ is then\nilluminated in the famous ‘mathematical experiment’\n(Me. 82b–85c). The slave finally manages, with some\npushing and pulling by Socrates, and some illustrations drawn in the\nsand, to double the area of a given square. In the course of this\ninterrogation, the disciple gradually discovers the relations between\nthe different lines, triangles, and squares. That Plato regards these\ninterconnections as crucial features of knowledge is confirmed later\nby the distinction that Socrates draws between knowledge and true\nbelief (97b–98b). As Socrates argues, true beliefs are\nunreliable, because they behave like ‘the statues of Daedalus\nthat easily run away as long as they are not tied down’. The\nrequisite ‘tying down’ happens (98a) “by giving an\naccount of the reason why. And that, Meno my friend, is recollection,\nas we previously agreed. After they are tied down, in the first place,\nthey become knowledge, and then they remain in place.” This\nexplanation indicates that, according to Plato, knowledge does not\nconsist in a mental ‘gazing’ at isolated models, but\nrather in uncovering the invariant relations that constitute the\nobjects in question.  \nThe complexity underlying Plato’s theory of the Forms as it is\nfirst applied in the Phaedo is easily overlooked, because the\nPhaedo initially suggests that that recollection is no more\nthan the grasping of concepts – the concept of ‘exact\nequality in size’, for example, is prompted by the perception of\nmore or less equal-seeming sticks and stones (74a–e). Not only\nthat, the same is suggested by the list through which Socrates first\nintroduces the Forms, 65d–e: “Do we say that there is such\na thing as the Just itself or not? And the Beautiful, and the Good?\n[…] I am speaking of all things such as Tallness, Health,\nStrength, and in a word, the reality of all other things, that which\neach of them essentially is.” Such an appeal to recollection\nleaves a lot to be desired. How does it work? How can one ensure that\none’s intuitive grasp of these natures is correct? That the\n‘recollection’ of isolated ideal objects is not the whole\nstory emerges later in the Phaedo when Socrates presents a\n‘simple minded hypothesis’ of the Forms as a way to avoid\nhis difficulties with the causes of generation and destruction\n(Phd. 99d–100e). The hypothesis he starts out with\nseems simpleminded indeed, because it consists of nothing more than\nthe assumption that everything is what it is by participating in the\ncorresponding Form. But it soon turns out that more is at stake than\nthat simple postulate. First, the hypothesis of each respective Form\nis to be tested by looking at the compatibility of its consequences.\nSecond, the hypothesis itself is to be secured by higher hypotheses,\nuntil some satisfactory starting point is attained. Unfortunately,\nSocrates explains neither the kinds of consequences nor of the kind of\n‘satisfactory highest principle’ he has in mind, but\nconfines himself to the demand for an orderly procedure. The\ndistinctions that Socrates subsequently introduces in preparation of\nhis last proof of the immortality of the soul seem, however, to\nprovide some information about the procedure in question\n(103d–107b). Socrates first introduces the distinction between\nessential and non-essential attributes. This distinction is then\napplied to the soul: because it always causes life in whatever it\noccupies, it must have life as its essential property, which it cannot\nlose. The soul is therefore incompatible with death and must be\n‘deathless’ = immortal. The viability of this argument,\nstripped here to its bare bones, need not engage us. The procedure\nshows, at any rate, that Plato resorts to relations between Forms\nhere. The essential tie between the soul and life is clearly not open\nto sense-perception; instead, understanding this tie takes a good deal\nof reflection on what it means to be, and to have a soul. To admirers\nof a two-world metaphysics, it may come as a disappointment that in\nPlato, recollection should consist in no more than the uncovering of\nsuch relationships. But this agrees well with the fact that with the\nexception of such concepts of perfection as ‘the Good’ and\n‘the Beautiful’, all of Plato’s examples in the\nPhaedo are quite pedestrian. Not only does he confine himself\nto concepts like ‘tallness’, ‘health’,\n‘strength’ and ‘the equal as such’, –\nthereby invoking objects that are familiar from every-day experience;\n– but he also treats the fact that knowledge of their nature\ncannot be derived from sense-perception alone as sufficient evidence\nfor the existence of the respective Forms, as he shows in the case of\nequal-looking sticks and stones. \nPlato does not employ his newly established metaphysical entities as\nthe basis to work out a definitive conception of the human soul and\nthe appropriate way of life in the Phaedo. Rather, he\nconfines himself to warnings against the contamination of the soul by\nthe senses and their pleasures, and quite generally against corruption\nby worldly values. He gives no advice concerning human conduct beyond\nthe recommendation of a general abstemiousness from worldly\ntemptations. This seems a rather austere picture of human life, and an\negocentric one, to boot, for nothing is said about relations between\nhuman beings, beyond Socrates’ exhortations that his friends\nshould likewise take care of their souls as best they can. It is\nunclear whether this otherworldly and ascetic attitude is the sign of\na particularly pessimistic period in Plato’s life or whether it\nmerely reflects the circumstances of the discussion –\nSocrates’ impending death. But as long as this negative or\nother-worldly attitude towards the physical side of human nature\nprevails, no interest is to be expected on the part of Plato in nature\nas a whole – let alone in the principles of the cosmic order\n(but cf. 5.1 below). But it is not only Platonic asceticism that\nstands in the way of such a wider perspective. Socrates himself seems\nto have been quite indifferent to the study of nature. The\nPhaedo admits that Socrates is unable to deal with the causes\nof natural processes, and the Apology contains an energetic\ndenial of any concern with natural philosophy on Socrates’ side.\nThe accusations that depict him as “a student of all things in\nthe sky and below the earth” are quite false (18c); he has never\nconversed on such issues at all, and the attribution to him of the\nAnaxagorean tenet that the sun is stone and the moon earth is a sign\nof his accusers’ recklessness (26d–e). And in a dialogue\nas late as the Phaedrus, Socrates famously explains his\npreference for the city and his avoidance of nature (230d):\n“Landscapes and trees have nothing to teach me – only the\npeople in the city can do that.” That Plato is not distorting\nthe facts here is confirmed by the testimony of Xenophon, who is\nequally emphatic about Socrates’ repudiation of the study of\nheavenly phenomena and his concentration on human affairs\n(Memorabilia I 1.15–16). If Plato later takes a much\nmore positive attitude towards nature in general, this is a\nconsiderable change of focus. In the Phaedo, he quite\ndeliberately confines his account of the nature of heaven and earth to\nthe myth about the afterlife (108d–114c). As he states in\nconclusion, this mythical depiction is not to be taken literally, but\nas an encouragement to heed its moral message and to take care of\none’s soul (114d–e). This is as constructive as Plato gets\nin his earlier discussions of the principles of ethics. \nIf Plato went through a period of open-ended experimentation, this\nstage was definitely over when he wrote the Republic, the\ncentral work of his middle years. Because of the\nRepublic’s importance a more detailed account will be\nnecessary, in order to explain the ethical principles set forth in\nthat work, for the principles are closely intertwined with political,\npsychological, and metaphysical conceptions. That the work represents\na major change in Plato’s thinking is indicated already by the\ndialogue’s setting. The aporetic controversy about justice in\nthe first book is set off quite sharply against the cooperative\ndiscussion that is to follow in the remaining nine books. Like the\nGorgias, the first book of the Republic presents\nthree interlocutors who defend, with increasing vigor, their notion of\njustice against Socrates’ elenchos. Of these disputes,\nthe altercation with the sophist Thrasymachus has received a lot of\nattention, because he defends the provocative thesis that natural\njustice is the right of the stronger, and that conventional justice is\nat best high-minded foolishness. The arguments employed by Socrates at\nthe various turns of the discussion will not be presented here. Though\nthey reduce Thrasymachus to angry silence, they are not above\ncriticism. Socrates himself expresses dissatisfaction with the result\nof this discussion R. 354c: “As far as I am concerned,\nthe result is that I know nothing, for when I don’t know what\njustice is, I’ll hardly know whether it is a kind of virtue or\nnot, or whether a person who has it is happy or unhappy.” But\nfor once, the confession of aporia is not the end of the\ndiscussion. Two members of the audience, Plato’s brothers\nGlaucon and Adeimantus, challenge Socrates: Perhaps Thrasymachus has\ndefended his case badly, but if Socrates wants to convince his\naudience, he must do better than that. The brothers demand a positive\naccount of what justice is, and of what it does to the soul of its\npossessor. \nThe change of character in the ensuing discussion is remarkable. Not\nonly are the two brothers not subjected to elenchos, they get\nample time to elaborate on their objections (357a–367e). Though\nthey are not themselves convinced that injustice is better than\njustice, they argue that in the present state of society injustice\npays – with the gods as well as with men – as long as the\nsemblance of respectability is preserved. To prove this claim the\nbrothers play devil’s advocate by unfolding a scathing picture\nof their society’s attitude towards justice. As the story of the\nRing of Gyges and its gift of invisibility proves, everyone who does\nnot have a god-like character will eventually succumb to such a\nring’s temptations (359c–360d). Instead of the wolf of\nThrasymachus’ account, it is the fox who is the paragon of\ninjustice. He will succeed at every level because he knows how to play\nthe power game with cunning. The just man, by contrast, pays no heed\nto mere semblance of goodness, rather than its substance,and therefore\nsuffers a Christ-like fate, because he does not comply with the\ndemands of favoritism and blandishment (361e). Even the gods, as the\npoets allegedly confirm, are on the side of the successful scoundrel,\nsince they can be propitiated by honors and sacrifices. Given this\nstate of affairs, a logic-chopping argument that justice is better\nthan injustice is quite insufficient for the brothers (367b–e:\nlogôi). Instead, Socrates should show what effect each\nof them have on the soul of their possessors. Plato at this point\nclearly regards refutation as an insufficient method of making true\nconverts; whether he ever had such confidence in the power of\nrefutation must remain a moot point. But the Republic shows\nthat the time had come for a positive account of morality and the good\nlife. If elenchos is used in Plato’s later dialogues,\nit is never again used in the knock-down fashion of the early\ndialogues. It should be pointed out, however, that in his treatment of\njustice Plato does not resort to the theory of Forms. Instead, he\noffers a political and psychological solution to the problem of\njustice. That a metaphysical solution is possible is indicated only\nbriefly and enigmatically, when Plato speaks of a ‘longer\nway’ that would also have been possible for him to take (435d;\n504b) \nA brief sketch of Plato’s approach to his inquiry into the\nnature of justice must suffice here, to make intelligible his\ndistinction of justice from the other kinds of virtue, and their role\nin the good life. This question is addressed in a quite circuitous\nway. Justice is first to be studied in the ‘larger text’\nof the state, rather than in the hard-to-decipher ‘small\ntext’ of the soul. A study of how a city comes to be will\nsupposedly reveal the origin of justice and injustice (369a). Its\nfounding principle is – at least at first – not\nhigh-minded concern, but mutual economic need: “A city\ncomes to be because none of us is self-sufficient\n(autarkês), but we all need many things. … And\nbecause people need many things, and because one person calls on a\nsecond out of one need and on a third out of a different need\n(chreia), many people gather in a single place to live\ntogether as partners and helpers.” The ‘need’ is, at\nleast at this point, purely economic. The minimal city is based on the\nneed for food, clothing, shelter, and for the requisite tools.\nEconomic efficiency dictates the adoption of the principle of the\n‘division of functions’: It is best if everyone performs\nthe task s/he is naturally most fit for. This principle determines not\nonly the structure of the minimal, self-subsistent state of farmers\nand craftsmen, but also the subsequent separation of the city’s\ninhabitants into three classees in the ‘maximal state’\nthat caters to higher demands. For a more luxurious city needs\nprotection by a professional army as well as the leadership of a class\nof philosopher-kings and -queens. Beyond the claim that the division\nof functions is more economical, Plato gives no justification for this\nfateful decision that determines the social order in the state, as\nwell as the nature of the virtues. Human beings are not born alike,\nbut with different abilities that predestine them for different tasks\nin a well-ordered state. This leads to Plato’s rule: ‘one\nperson – one job’ (R. 370a–c; 423d). \nBecause the division of functions paves the way for the definition of\njustice as ‘doing your own thing’ in Book IV\n(432d–433b), it is necessary to briefly review the kind of\nsocial order Plato has in mind, the psychological principles he\nassumes, and the political institutions by which that order is to be\nattained. For this explains not only the establishment of a\nthree-class society and the corresponding structure of the soul, but\nalso Plato’s theory of education and its metaphysical\nunderpinnings. That economic needs are the basis of the political\nstructure does not, of course, mean that they are the only human needs\nPlato recognizes. It indicates, however, that the emphasis here is on\nthe unity and self-sufficiency of a well-structured city, not on the\nwell-being of the individual (423c–e; 425c). This focus should\nbe kept in mind when assessing the ‘totalitarianism’ and\nrigorous cultural conservatism of Plato’s political\nphilosophy. \nThe need for a professionally trained army leads to the discussion of\neducation and moral psychology, because the preservation of internal\npeace and external security presupposes the combination of two\ndifferent character-traits among the ‘guardians’\n(‘the philosophical watchdogs’, 375d–376c):\nfriendliness towards their fellow-citizens and fierceness towards\ntheir enemies. The injunctions concerning their appropriate education\nare very detailed, because it must combine the right kind of\n‘muses’ (poetry, music, and other fine arts) with the\nappropriate physical training to develop the right temperament and\nattitude in the soldiers (376d–403d). The ‘muses’\ncome in for protracted criticism, both in content and form. All\nstories that undermine respect towards the gods are to be banned,\nalong with tales that instill fear of death in the guardians. The\nimitation of bad persons is forbidden, as are depictions of varieties\nof character, quite generally. Analogous injunctions apply,\nmutandis mutatis, to the modes and rhythms in music and to\npainting. Physical exercise must suit the harmonious soul and\ntherefore must not exceed what is healthy and necessary\n(403e–412b). Because the educational scheme is geared to secure\na harmonious and yet spirited class of soldiers, Plato bans from his\ncity most of the cultural achievements that were his\ncontemporaries’ pride and joy. There must be nothing to disturb\nthe citizens’ willingness to fulfill their tasks. The\nsupervision of education is the function of the third class, the\nrulers of the city (412b–417b). They are to be selected through\ntests of intelligence and character from among the soldiers, to\nidentify individuals who are unshakable in their conviction that their\nown well-being is intimately tied to that of the city. To ensure that\nmembers of the ruling and military classes retain their right attitude\ntowards their civic duties, members of both classes must lead a\ncommunal life, without private homes, families, or property. His\ninterlocutor’s objection that such a life is not apt to make\nthese citizens happy (419a) is the first approach to the topic of\nhappiness, but it is quickly brushed aside at this point on the\ngrounds that the political order is designed to make the entire city\nhappy, rather than any particular group. \nThe division of functions that leads to the separation of the three\nclasses for the purpose of achieving the social conditions for justice\nconcludes the discussion of the social order (427d–434c). The\nsomewhat peculiar manner in which Socrates further develops his\nexplation of the nature of justice can be understood with reference to\nthis concluding discussion. The catalogue of what in later tradition\nhas been dubbed ‘the four cardinal Platonic virtues’\n– wisdom, courage, moderation, and justice – is first\npresented without comment. Piety, as the text indicates, is no longer\ntreated as a virtue, for religious practices should be left to\ntradition and the oracle of Apollo at Delphi (427b–c). The\ndefinition of justice is to be discovered by a process of elimination.\nIf there are four virtues in the city, then justice must be the one\nthat is left over after the other three have been identified (427e).\nThere is no proof offered that there are exactly four virtues in a\nstate, nor that they are items that can be lifted up, singly, for\ninspection, like objects from a basket. Instead, Socrates points out\nthe role they play in the maintenance of the social order. About\nwisdom (sophia), the only purely intellectual virtue and the\nexclusive possession of the rulers (428b–429a), little more is\nsaid at this point than that it is ‘good council’\n(euboulia) in decisions about the internal and external\naffairs of the city. Courage (andreia) is the soldiers’\nspecific virtue (429a–430c). Socrates takes some trouble\nexplaining its nature, because it is a mixture of belief\n(doxa) and steadfastness of character\n(sôtêria). It is compared to colorfast wool:\nthrough thick and thin the guardians must be dyed-in-the-wool\nadherents to the laws’ decrees about what is to be feared.\nModeration (sôphrosunê) (430d–432a) is not\nan intellectual excellence either, but rather a combination of belief\nwith a certain disposition to support order. It is a conviction\n(doxa, 431e) shared by all classes about who should rule\n– a conviction based on a state of ‘order’\n(kosmos), ‘consonance’ (sumphônia)\nand ‘harmony’ (harmonia) in and through which the\nbetter class in the state controls the pleasures and desires of the\nlower class. The third class, then, has no specific virtue of its own.\nThe identification of justice, the virtue that is left over, is due to\na sudden ‘discovery’ on Socrates’ part\n(432d–434c) that justice is the principle that has been at work\nall along in the founding of the model state – namely that\neveryone is to “do their own thing and not meddle with that of\nanother” (433a). At first sight, it seems hard to tell how\njustice differs from moderation as a “consonance about who\nshould rule and be ruled.” Justice as “doing your own\nthing” may represent a more active state of mind with a wider\nextension, given that its task is also to see to it that “no\ncitizen should have what belongs to another or be deprived of what is\nhis own” (433e). But since Socrates does not elaborate on the\ndispositions of justice and moderation any further, there seems to be\nonly a fine line between the functions of justice and moderation in\nthe city. That there are four virtues rather than three probably also\nreflects the fact that this catalogue of four was a fixture in\ntradition. As will emerge in connection with the virtues in the\nindividual soul, the distinction between justice and moderation is far\nless problematic in the case of the individual than in that of the\ncity as a whole, because in the individual soul, internal self-control\nand external self-restraint are clearly different attitudes. As this\nsurvey shows, the virtues are no longer confined to knowledge. They\nalso contain right beliefs and attitudes of harmony and compliance\n– extensions that are apt to make up for deficiencies in the\nexplanation of certain virtues in earlier dialogues. \nThe promise to establish the isomorphic structure of the city and soul\nhas not been forgotten. After the definition and assignment of the\nfour virtues to the three classes of the city, the investigation turns\nto the role and function of the virtues in the soul. The soul is held\nto consist of three parts , corresponding to the three classes in the\ncity. The lengthy argument for the tri-partition of the soul into a\nrational (logistikon), a spirited (thumoeides), and\nan appetitive (epithumêtikon) part (434d–441c),\ncan here be neither reproduced nor subjected to critical evaluation.\nThat Plato lets Socrates express reservations concerning the adequacy\nof his own procedure (435c–d), despite his unusually circumspect\nway of justifying his division of the soul’s faculties,\nindicates that he regards it as an important innovation. Indeed, there\nis no indication of separate parts of the soul in any of the earlier\ndialogues; irrational desires are attributed to the influence of the\nbody. In the Republic, by contrast, the soul itself becomes\nthe source of the appetites and desires. The difference between the\nrational and the appetitive part is easily justified, because the\nopposition between the decrees of reason and the various kinds of\nunreasonable desires is familiar to everyone (438d–439e). The\nexistence of a third, a ‘spirited’ or courageous part\n– different from reason and desire – is harder to prove.\nBut the phenomenon of moral indignation is treated as evidence for a\npsychic force that is reducible neither to reason nor to any of the\nappetites; it is rather an ally of reason in a well-ordered soul, a\nforce opposed to unruly appetites (439e–441c). This concludes\nthe proof that there are three parts in the soul corresponding to the\nthree classes in the city – namely the rational part in the\nwisdom of the rulers, the spirited part, which is manifested in the\ncourage of the soldiers, the appetitive part, which is manifested in\nthe rest of the population, whose defining motivation is material\ngain.  \nThe discussion of the division of the soul sets the stage for\nSocrates’ final contrast of of justice with injustice: In the\ncity there is justice if the members of the three classes mind their\nown business; in the individual soul, justice likewise consists in\neach part fulfilling its own function. This presupposes that the two\nupper parts have been given the right kind of training and education\nin order to control the appetitive part (441d–442a). The three\nother virtues are then assigned to the respective parts of the soul.\nCourage is the excellence of the spirited part, wisdom belongs to the\nrational part, and moderation is the consent of all three about who\nshould rule and who should obey. Justice turns out to be the overall\nunifying quality of the soul (443c–e). For, the just person not\nonly refrains from meddling with what is not his, externally, but also\nharmonizes the three parts of the soul internally. While justice is\norder and harmony, injustice is its opposite: it is a rebellion of one\npart of the city or soul against the others, and an inappropriate rule\nof the inferior parts. Justice and injustice in the soul are, then,\nanalogous to health and illness in the body. This comparison suffices\nto bring the investigation to its desired result. If justice is health\nand harmony of the soul, then injustice must be disease and disorder.\nHence, it is clear that justice is a good state of the soul that makes\nits possessor happy, and injustice is its opposite. Just as no-one in\nhis right mind would prefer to live with a ruined body so no-one would\nprefer to live with a diseased soul. In principle, the discussion of\njustice has therefore reached its promised goal at the end of Book IV.\nSocrates has met Glaucon’s and Adeimantus’ challenge to\nprove that justice is a good, in and by itself, for the soul of its\npossessor, and preferable to injustice.  \nThat the discussion does not end here but occupies six more books, is\ndue most of all to several loose ends that need to be tied up. Apart\nfrom the fact that reason and order are to reign supreme, little has\nbeen said about the citizens’ way of life. This gap will be\nfilled, at least in part, by the description of the communal life\nwithout private property and family in Book V. More importantly,\nnothing has been said about the rulers and their particular kind of\nknowledge. This is a crucial point because, as the definitions of the\nthree ‘inferior’ virtues show, their quality is contingent\non the rulers’ wisdom. Socrates addresses this problem with the\nprovocative thesis (473c–d): “Until philosophers rule as\nkings or those who are now called kings and leaders genuinely and\nadequately philosophize ... cities will have no rest from evils, nor\nwill the human race.” This thesis starts the discussion of the\nphilosophers’ knowledge, and of their upbringing and education,\nwhich will continue through Books VI and VII. Because they also\nintroduce the special objects of the philosophers’ knowledge,\nthese books provide the metaphysical underpinning of the entire\nconception of the good state and of the good soul. For the ‘Form\nof the Good’ turns out to be the ultimate source of all being\nand knowledge. A short summary of the upshot of the educational\nprogram must suffice here. The future philosophers, both women and\nmen, are selected from the group of guardians whose general cultural\ntraining they share. If they combine moral firmness with quickness of\nmind, they are subject to a rigorous curriculum of higher learning\nthat will prepare them for the ascent from the world of the senses to\nthe world of intelligence and truth, an ascent whose stages are summed\nup in the similes of the Sun, the Line, and the Cave\n(508a–518b). To achieve this ascent, the students have to\nundergo, first, a preparatory schooling of ten years’ duration\nin the ‘liberal arts’: arithmetic, geometry, astronomy,\nand theoretical harmonics (518c–531c). Afterwards they are\nadmitted to the training in the master-science of\n‘dialectic’, a science of which little more is said beyond\nthe indication that it enables its possessor to deal in a systematic\nway with the objects of real knowledge – the Forms in general,\n– and with the Form of the Good, – the principle of the\ngoodness of all else, – in particular (531c–535a). This\nstudy is to last for another five years. Successful candidates are\nthen sent back into the Cave as administrators of ordinary political\nlife for about 15 years. At the age of fifty the rulers are granted\nthe pursuit of philosophy, an activity that is interrupted by periods\nof service as overseers of the order of the state. This completes, in\na nutshell, the description of the philosopher-kings’ and\n-queens’ education and activities (539d–541b). \nThis design of an autocratic rule by an aristocracy of the mind has\nreceived a lot of flak; but an assessment of Plato’s politics\nmust here be limited to the kind of happiness it supposedly provides.\nRegardless of whether or not we accept his overall principle of the\nGood as the basis of the political order, Plato’s model state\nhas, at least in theory, the advantage that it guarantees external and\ninternal peace. That is no mean feat in a society where external and\ncivil wars were a constant threat, and often enough ended in the\ndestruction of the entire city. The division of functions guarantees a\nhigh degree of efficiency, if every citizen does what he/she is\nnaturally suited to do. But what about the citizens’ needs,\nbeyond those for security and material goods? Are they to find their\nlife’s fulfillment in the pursuit of their jobs only? Plato\nseems to think so; he characterizes each class by its specific kind of\ndesire and its respective good (581c): the philosophers are lovers of\nwisdom (philosophoi), the soldiers lovers of honor\n(philotimoi), and the workers are lovers of material goods\n(philochrêmatoi). That human beings find, or at least\ntry to find, satisfaction in the kinds of goods they cherish is a\npoint further pursued in the depiction of the decay of the city and\nits ruling citizens, from the best – the aristocracy of the mind\n– down to the worst – the tyranny of lust, in Books VIII\nand IX. A discussion of the tenability of this explanation of\npolitical and psychological decadence will not be attempted here. It\nis supposed to show that all inferior forms of government of city and\nsoul are doomed to fail because of the inherent tensions between the\ngoods that are aimed for. \nSome comments on Plato’s conception of happiness are in order,\nhowever. He clearly goes on the assumption that human beings are happy\ninsofar as they achieve the goals they cherish. Though this notion\nseems to come close to the ‘preference satisfaction’ for\nall citizens that is nowadays regarded as the primary aim of every\nliberal state, Plato’s restriction of each class to one type of\ngood remains objectionable, most obviously in the case of the citizens\nof the third class who supposedly covet nothing but material goods.\nThis ‘reductive’ view of their human nature militates not\nonly against present-day intuitions: It should also militate against\nPlato’s own moral psychology, in that all human souls consist of\nthree parts – a rational, a spirited, and an appetitive part\n– whose health and harmony constitute the soul’s and the\nstate’s happiness. Why, then, reduce the third class to\nanimal-like creatures with low appetites, as suggested by the\ncomparison of the people to a strong beast that must be placated\n(493a–c)? This comparison is echoed later in the comparison of\nthe soul to a multiform beast, where reason just barely controls the\nhydra-like heads of the appetites, and then only with the aid of a\nlion-like spirit (588c–590d). Is Plato thereby giving vent to\nanti-democratic sentiments, showing contempt for the rabble, as has\noften been claimed? He can at least be cleared of the suspicion that\nthe workers are mere serfs of the upper classes, because he explicitly\ngrants them the free enjoyment of all the customary goods that he has\ndenied to the upper classes (419a): “Others own land, build fine\nbig houses, acquire furnishings to go along with them, make their own\nprivate sacrifices to the gods, entertain guests, and also, of course,\npossess what you were talking about just now, gold and silver and all\nthe things that are thought to belong to people who are blessedly\nhappy.” But apart from such liberties, the members of the third\nclass are quite neglected in Plato’s ideal city. Apparently no\neducation is provided for them, for there is no suggestion that they\nparticipate in the guardians’ musical and athletic training, and\nthere is no mention that obedience to the rulers’ commands\ncannot be the only source of happiness for the third class. Plato\nseems to sidestep his own insight that all human beings have an\nimmortal soul and have to take care of it as best they can, as he not\nonly demands in the Phaedo but is going to confirm in a\nfanciful way in the Myth of Er at the end of Republic Book\nX. \nThe life-style designated for the upper classes also seems open to\nobjections. The soldiers’ musical and physical training is\nstrictly regimented; they must take satisfaction in the obedience to\nthe laws for the sake of preserving the city’s inner and outer\npeace, and in deeds of valor in war. Theirs is an austere camp-life;\nnot all of them will be selected for higher education. But even the\nphilosophers’ lives leave a lot to be desired, and not only\nbecause they have to starve their common human appetites and devote\nmany years to administrative duties back in the ‘Cave’.\nTheir intellectual pursuits are also not entirely enviable, as a\ncloser inspection would show. Not only do the philosophers have two\njobs – in violation of the rule ‘one person – one\nfunction’ – in that they are responsible for both\nadministrative work and philosophical reflection: They are also not to\nenjoy open-ended research, but are rather subject to a mental training\nthat is explicitly designed to turn their minds away from the\nenjoyment of all worldly beauty in order to focus exclusively on the\ncontemplation of the Forms. This is indicated in the injunctions\nconcerning the study of astronomy and harmonics (529a–531d). The\nstudents are not to crane their necks to watch the beauty of the\n“embroidery in the heavens”, but rather to concern\nthemselves with the ideal motions of ideal moving bodies in a purely\ngeometrical fashion, and they are not to listen to audible sounds, but\nto attend to the mathematics of harmonics. The universe is not treated\nas an admirable cosmos, with the explicit purpose of providing moral\nand intellectual support to the citizens, in the way Plato is going to\nstate in the Timaeus and in the Laws. Given these\nlimitations of the philosophers’ mental exercises in the\nRepublic, the claim that their lives are 729 times more\npleasant than the tyrants’ (IX 587e) seems like a gross\nexaggeration, even if they enjoy the pleasures of being filled with\npure and unadulterated truths while everyone else enjoys only\nsemblances of the really real (581e–588a). \nFor all the advances that the Republic represents in some\nrespects, Plato’s ideal city seems to us far from ideal. The\nsystem resembles a well-oiled machine where everyone has their\nappointed function and economic niche; but its machine-like character\nseems repellent, given that no deviations are permitted from the\nprescribed pattern. If innovations are forbidden, no room seems to be\nleft for creativity and personal development. Plato seems to\npresuppose that the fulfillment of a person’s function is\nsufficient to secure her happiness, or at least that is suggested by\nthe ‘functional’ argument that defeats Thrasymachus\n(352d–354a). It states that every object, animal, and person has\na specific function or work (ergon). If it performs its\nfunction well, it does well: for a living thing, ‘doing\nwell’ means ‘living well’ and living well is\ntantamount to living happily. Though Socrates’ refutation of\nThrasymachus is found wanting as a proof of justice’s\nsuperiority, the ergon-argument is nowhere revoked. On the\ncontrary, it is affirmed by the principle of ‘one person –\none job’ that is the basis of Plato’s ideal city. But it\nseems rather inhumane to confine everyone’s activities to just\none kind of work, even if such confinement may be most\neconomical and efficient. These features suffice to make the ideal\nlife in Plato’s city unpalatable to us, not to speak of certain\nother features that have not been explored here, such as the communal\nlife envisaged for the upper classes, and the assignment of sexual\npartnerships by lotteries that are rigged for reasons of eugenics. The\nfeature that must strike us as strangest about Plato’s depiction\nof his citizens’ lives is that he does not even emphasize the\none factor that could throw a more favorable light on his\nsocial order – that each citizen will take pride and joy in\ntheir work and its products, given that these are to be regarded, each\nin their own way, as valuable contributions to the community’s\nwell-being. This applies especially to the members of the third class\n– tailors, carpenters, doctors, architects, sailors, and all\nthose who are summed up rather ungraciously under the epithet of\n‘money-lovers’ — because they, after all, produce\nthe city’s material goods, whithout which the city could not\nfunction or exist. \nHas this fact escaped Plato’s notice, alongside other\ndeficiencies of his blue-print of an ideal city? Against all these\ncomplaints, justified as they must seem, it should be pointed out that\nPlato clearly is not concerned with the conditions that would make his\ncity ‘livable’. His aim is rather more limited: He wants\nto present a model, and to work out its essential features.\nThe same explanation applies to his depiction of the city’s and\nits citizens’ decay in Books VIII and IX. Contrary to many\ncritics’ assumptions, Plato is not there trying to predict and\nexplain the course of history. Rather, he wants to explain the\ngeneration and decay typical of each political system and the\npsychopathology of its leaders. Plato finds the basis of both in the\n‘values’ – be they honor, money, freedom, or lust\n– that are embedded in he constitutions of the different types\nof state. It is unlikely that Plato presupposes that there are pure\nrepresentatives of these types, though some historical states may have\ncome closer to being representatives than others. Given that\nPlato’s aim is to work out the model of a well-functioning\nstate, he does not and need not concern himself with softening the\nfeatures of his bare sketch of the decay of the city and of the souls\nof the citizens due to their inherent tensions. If his decision to\nconcentrate on a model explains certain inhumane features of\nPlato’s political vision, are there any indications that he was\naware of the limitations that he imposed on his ‘political\nanimals’ by confining them to just one function in an\nefficiently run community? Was Plato aware of the fact that his\nblack-and-white picture of civic life in his model state disregards\nthe claim of individuals to have their own aims and ends, and not to\nbe treated like automata, with no thoughts and wishes of their own?\nThough the Republic contains some suggestions that would\nmitigate this bleak picture, for the sake of balancing this picture,\nit is more fruitful, to look at other works of Plato’s middle\nperiod that concentrate on and prioritize the conditions of the\nindividual soul rather than focus on the demands of the community.\nThese works are the Symposium and the Phaedrus. For\nthough each dialogue should be studied as a unity of its own, it is\nalso necessary to treat the individual dialogues as part of a wider\npicture. \nThe Symposium and the Phaedrus are two dialogues\nthat focus on the individual soul and pay no attention to communal\nlife at all. Instead, they concentrate on self-preservation,\nself-improvement, and self-completion. The Symposium is often\ntreated as a dialogue that predates the Republic, most of all\nbecause it mentions neither the immortality nor the tripartition of\nthe soul. But its dramatic staging – the praise of Eros by a\ncompany of symposiasts – is not germane to the otherworldly and\nascetic tendencies of the Gorgias and the Phaedo. In\naddition, Plato has good reasons for leaving aside a discussion of the\nseparation of the soul’s faculties in the Symposium,\nbecause he aims to show that love is an incentive, not only for all\nhumans, but also for other living beings. Contrary to all other\nspeakers, Socrates denies that Eros is a god, because the gods are in\na state of perfection. Love, by contrast, is a desire of the needy for\nthe beautiful and the good (199c–201c). Socrates thereby\ncorrects the previous speakers’ confusion of love with the\nbeloved object. This insight is presented not as Socrates’ own,\nbut as the upshot of a ‘lecture on the nature of love by the\nwise Diotima’ (201d–212b): Eros is a powerful demon, a\nbeing between the mortal and the immortal, an eternally needy hunter\nof the beautiful. Human beings share that demonic condition; for they\nare neither good nor bad, but desire the good and the beautiful, the\npossession of which would constitute happiness for them. Because all\npeople want happiness, they pursue the good as well as they can\n(205a–206b). In each case they desire the particular kinds of\nobjects that they hope will fulfill their needs. Such fulfillment is\nnot a passive possession; it is rather the objects of love are deemed\nto be essential in the struggle for self-preservation,\nself-completion, and self-fulfillment (207d): “For among animals\nthe principle is the same as with us, and mortal nature seeks so far\nas possible to live forever and be immortal. And this is possible in\none way only: by reproduction, because it leaves behind a new young\none in place of the old.” There is, then, a constant need for\nself-restoration and self-improvement by procreation in the quest for\nearthly immortality. In the case of human beings this need expresses\nitself in different ways. The search for\n‘self-eternalization’ may result in, or even be fulfilled\nby, the production of biological children or of so-called\n‘children of the mind’ (e.g. works of the arts), or even\nby the creation of order in cities that are then guided by the virtues\nof justice and moderation (209a–e). Diotima’s lecture is\nfinally crowned by a depiction of the famous scala amoris\n– Diotima’s explanation of the refinement and sublimation\nthat a person experiences when recognizing higher and higher kinds of\nbeauty (210a–212a). Starting with the love of one beautiful\nbody, the individual gradually learns to appreciate not only all\nphysical beauty, but also the beauty of the mind, and in the end she\ngets a glimpse of the supreme kind of beauty, namely the Form of the\nBeautiful itself – a beauty that is neither relative, nor\nchangeable, nor a matter of degree. \nBecause beauty of the higher kind is tied to virtue, and is attained\nby the comprehension of what is common in laws and public\ninstitutions, it is clear that Plato does not have purely aesthetic\nvalues in mind, but principles of good order that are ultimately tied\nto the Form of the Beautiful/Good. The difference between the\nRepublic’s and the Symposium’s accounts\nlies in the fact that the scala amoris treats physical beauty\nas an incentive to the higher and better, an incentive that in\nprinciple affects every human being. There is no talk of a painful\nliberation from the bonds of the senses, or of a turn-around of the\nentire soul that is reserved only for the better educated. Brief as\nthe Symposium’s explanation of happiness is, it shows\nthree things: First, all human beings aim for their own\nself-preservation and -completion. Second, this drive finds its\nexpression in the products of their work, in creativity. Third, their\nrespective activities are instigated by each person’s own\nparticular desire for the beautiful. There is no indication that\nindividuals must act as part of a community. Though the communitarian\naspect of the good and beautiful comes to the fore in the high praise\nof the products of the legendary legislators (209e–210a), the\nultimate assent to the Beautiful itself is up to the individual. The\nmessage of the Symposium is not unique in Plato’s\nworks. The Lysis shares its basic assumption concerning the\nintermediary state of human nature between good and bad, and regards\nneed as the basis of friendship. Due to the aporetic\ncharacter of that dialogue, its lesson remains somewhat obscure, but\nit is obvious enough that it shares the Symposium’s\ngeneral anthropological presuppositions.  \nThe idea that eros is the incentive to sublimation and\nself-completion is worked out further in the Phaedrus.\nAlthough the close relationship between the two dialogues is generally\nacknowledged, the Phaedrus is commonly regarded as a much\nlater work. For not only does it accept the Republic’s\npsychological doctrine of a tri-partite soul, it also advocates the\nimmortality of the soul – doctrines that are conspicuously\nabsent in the Symposium. But this difference seems due to a\ndifference in perspective rather than to a change of mind. The\ndiscussion in the Symposium is deliberately confined to the\nconditions of self-immortalization in this life, while the\nPhaedrus takes the discussion beyond the confines of this\nlife. If it shares the Republic’s doctrine of a\ndivision of the soul into three parts, it does so for reasons of its\nown: The three parts of the soul in the Phaedrus are not\nsupposed to justify the separation of people into three classes. They\nexplain, rather, the different routes taken by individuals in their\nsearch for beauty and their levels of success. If the\nPhaedrus goes beyond the Symposium, it does so in\norder to show how the enchantment of beauty can be combined with an\nelement of Plato’s philosophy that seems quite alien to the\nnotions of self-improvement and sublimation through the love of\nbeauty. That element is abruptly identified as dialectic, the\nsystematic method of collection and division that is characteristic of\nPlato’s later work. At first sight, it might seem that the\ndialogue’s topic, Eros, is hardly the right tie to keep together\nthe dialogue’s two disparate parts – i.e. the highly\npoetical depiction of the enchantment of beauty, and Plato’s\nsubsequent, quite pedestrian methodological explanations of the\npresuppositions of rhetoric. But although the coherence of the\nPhaedrus cannot be argued for in full here, the notion that\nthe Phaedrus is disjointed does not do justice to the\ndialogue’s careful composition and overall aim.  \nRhetoric, its purpose and value, is in fact the dialogue’s topic\nright from the start. The misuse of rhetoric is exemplified by the\nspeech attributed to the orator Lysias, a somewhat contrived plea to\nfavor a non-lover rather than a lover. Socrates’ retort points\nup Lysias’ presuppositions – that love is a kind of\nsickness, an irrational craving for the pleasures of the body; that a\nlover tries to dominate and enslave the beloved physically, materially\nand mentally, and, most importantly, that the lover tries to deprive\nthe beloved of philosophy. Once restored to his senses the lover will\nshun his former beloved and break all his promises. This one-sided\nview of Eros is corrected in Socrates’ second speech: Eros,\nproperly understood, is not a diseased state of mind, but a kind of\n‘divine madness’ (theia mania). To explain the\nnature of this madness, Socrates employs the comparison of the\ntripartite soul to a charioteer with a pair winged horses, an obedient\nwhite one and an unruly black one. The crucial difference between the\nPhaedrus’ tripartition and that in the\nRepublic lies in in this: instead of a painful liberation\nthrough education, the Phaedrus envisages a liberation\nthrough the uplifting force of love, a love that is – just as it\nis in the Symposium – instigated by physical beauty.\nThat is what first makes the soul grow wings and soar in the pursuit\nof a corresponding deity, to the point where it may attain godlike\ninsights. The best-conditioned souls – those where the\ncharioteer has full control over his horses – get a glimpse of\ntrue being, including the nature of the virtues and of the good\n(247c–e). Depending on the quality of each soul, the quality of\nthe beauty pursued will also determine the cycle of reincarnations\nthat is in store for each soul after death (248c–249c).  \nWhat is remarkable in the Phaedrus’ picture of the\nuplifting effect of beauty is not only its exuberant tone and imagery,\nwhich goes far beyond the Symposium’s unadorned\nscala amoris, but also its intricate interweaving of mythical\nand philosophical elements. For in the midst of his fanciful depiction\nof the different fates that are in store for different kinds of souls,\nPlato specifies, in quite technical terms, that the capacity “to\nunderstand speech in terms of general Forms, proceeding to bring many\nperceptions together into a reasoned unity”, (249b–c), is\nthe condition for the reincarnation of dead individuals as human\nbeings. It is this capacity for abstract thought that he then calls\n“recollection of what the soul saw when it was traveling with\ngod, when it disregarded the things we now call real and lifted up its\nhead to what is truly real instead.” The heavenly adventure\nseems to amount to no more than the employment of the dialectical\nmethod that Socrates is going to describe, without further mythical\ncamouflage, in the dialogue’s second part. The ability to\nestablish unity in a given subject-matter, and to divide it up\naccording to its natural kinds, is the art that characterizes the\n‘scientific rhetorician’ (265d–266b). Socrates\nprofesses the greatest veneration for such a master: “If I\nbelieve that someone is capable of discerning a single thing that is\nalso by nature capable of encompassing many, I follow ‘straight\nbehind, in his tracks, as if he were a god’.” So the\nheavenly voyage has a quite down-to-earth counterpart in the\ndialectical method – a method that Plato regards, as he is going\nto confirm in the Philebus, as a ‘gift of the\ngods’. At the same time, Plato’s esteem for taxonomy\nexplains the inner unity of the Phaedrus’ seemingly\nincongruous two parts as two sides of one coin, and it also shows why\nPlato no longer treats the sensory as a distraction and disturbance of\nthe mind per se. For the properly conditioned souls’\nsensory impressions are its first incentives to the higher and\nbetter. \nWhat concept of happiness is suggested by this ‘inspired’\nview of human life? The individual does not find her or his\nfulfillment in peaceful interactions in a harmonious community.\nInstead, life is spent in the perennial pursuit of the higher and\nbetter. But in that task the individual is not alone; she shares that\ntask with kindred spirits. The message of the the Symposium\nand the Phaedrus is therefore two-pronged. On the one hand,\nthere is no permanent attainment of happiness as a stable state of\ncompletion in this life. In the ups and downs of life (and of the\nafterlife), humans are in constant need of beauty as an incentive to\naim for their own completion. Humans are neither god-like nor wise; at\nbest, they are god-lovers and philosophers, demonic hunters for truth\nand goodness. To know is not to have; and to have once is not to have\nforever. In the Symposium, Diotima states in no uncertain\nterms that humans have a perennial need to replenish what they lose,\nboth in body and soul, because they are mortal and changeable\ncreatures, and the Phaedrus confirms the need for continued\nefforts, for the heavenly voyage is not a one-time affair. On the\nother hand, the second part of he message conveyed is that the pursuit\nof the good and the beautiful is not a lonely enterprise. As the\nPhaedrus makes clear, love for a beautiful human being is an\nincentive to search for a higher form of life, as a sacred joint\njourney of two friends in communion (255a–256e). The need for,\nand also the possibility of, constant self-completion and -repletion\nis a motive that will also reappear in the ethical thought of\nPlato’s late works, a motif he sometimes presents as the maxim\nthat humans should aim at the ‘likening of oneself to\ngod’, (homoiôsis theôi Theaetetus\n176b; Timaeus 90c). \nSober philosophers have a tendency to ignore such visionary talk as\ntoo elevated and lacking in substance to be worth serious thought.\nThat Plato, appearances notwithstanding, is not indulging in a\ngod-besotted rêverie in the Phaedrus is\nindicated by his interweaving of the mythical description in the\ndialogue’s first part, and his description and exploration of\nthe dialectical method in the later part (259e-279c), where Socrates\nattempts to determine the requirements of ‘scientific\nrhetoric’ (259e–279c). Artful speaking (and even artful\ndeception) presupposes knowledge of the truth, especially where the\nidentity of the phenomena is difficult to grasp, because similarities\ncan be deceptive. This applies in particular to concepts like the good\nand the just, as witnessed by the wide disagreement about their nature\n(263a–c). The development of the ‘sharp eye’ that is\nneeded to assign each object to the right class is the aim of\nPlato’s method of collection and division, a method on which he\nexpounds at some length in the Phaedrus. Plato discusses the\ncare that is needed in order to (265d–e) “see together\nthings that are scattered about everywhere, and to collect them into\none kind (mia idea)”, as well as “to cut the\nunity up again according to its species along its natural joints, and\nto try not to splinter any part, as a bad butcher might do.”\nThat this method is supposed to serve an overall ethical purpose is\nconfirmed by the fact that rhetoric based on truth must reflect the\nspeaker’s knowlege not only of the different types of souls and\nthe types of speech that fit them (271d), but also of the truth about\njust and good things (272d). \nThat dialectic is geared to this end is somewhat obscured in the\nsubsequent discussion in the Phaedrus. First of all, Plato\nturns away from this issue in his long depiction of the iniquities of\ncontemporary rhetoricians, when he constrasts their efforts with\nscientific rhetoric. And Plato continues this excursion with a\ndiscussion of speaking and writing, culminating in his famous\n‘critique of writing’. Second, although Plato makes ample\nuse of the method of collection and division in later dialogues such\nas the Sophist and the Statesman, he seems to pay\nlittle heed to problems of ethics, with the exception of the\nPhilebus. But the aptness of the dialectical method in\ndiscerning the nature of the good has already been emphasized in the\nRepublic (534b–c): “ Unless someone can\ndistinguish in an account the Form of the good from everything else,\ncan survive all refutation as if in battle... you will say that he\ndoes not know the good itself or any other good.” Brief as these\nremarks are, they show that the application of dialectic to the\nunderstanding and pursuit of the good is of central importance. That\nthe Good is nowhere subjected to such treatment must be due to the\nenormity of the task involved in undertaking a systematic\nidentification of all that is good, and in distinguishing good things\nfrom each other, as well as from the Form of the Good. Although it is\nunclear whether Plato had already refined the dialectical method in\nthe systematic way indicated in the Phaedrus, the hints\ncontained in the Republic about a ‘longer way’\n(435d; 504b) to determine the nature of justice and the other virtues\nseem to suggest that the the development of a systematic method of\ncollection and division was ‘in the works’. As a closer\nlook at the much later Philebus will show, the determination\nof what is good about each kind of thing presupposes more than a\nclassification by collection and division. For in addition, the\ninternal structure of each kind of entity has to be determined.\nKnowledge is not confined to the comprehension of the objects’\nbeing, identity, difference and other external interrelations that\nexist in a given field. It also presupposes the knowledge of what\nconstitutes the objects’ internal unity and complexity. It\nwould, of course, be rather presumptuous to claim that Plato had not\nseen the need to investigate the ontological ‘anatomy’, as\nwell as taxonomy, of the Forms from early on. But as the late\ndialogues show, it took him quite some effort to develop the requisite\nconceptual tools for such analyses.  \nBefore we turn to the late dialogues, a final review is in order of\nthe kind of good life Plato envisages in the dialogues under\ndiscussion here. In the Symposium, the emphasis is on the\nindividual’s creative work, which involves others at least as\ncatalysts in one’s efforts to attain self-perpetuation and\ncompletion. The quality of life attainable for each person differs,\ndepending on the kind of ‘work’ each individual is able to\nproduce. This is what the scala amoris is all about. In the\nPhaedrus, the emphasis is more on the ‘joint\nventure’ of kindred souls. True friends will get to the highest\npoint of self-fulfillment by the joint insights that their\nsouls’ conditions permit them to attain. Just as in the\nSymposium, the philosophical life is deemed the best. But\nthen, this preference is found everywhere in Plato and itis not unique\nto him: all ancient philosophers regard their own occupation as the\ntrue fulfillment of human life. If there are differences between them,\nthey concern the kinds of study and occupation that are deemed\nappropriate to philosophy. The more individualistic view of happiness\nespoused in the Symposium and in the Phaedrus need,\nhowever, not be seen as a later stage in Plato’s development\nthan the Republic’s communitarian conception. They may\nbe complementary, rather than rival, points of view, and no fixed\nchronology need be assumed in order to accommodate both.  \nNature and natural things are not among the objects that concern Plato\nin his earlier and middle philosophical investigations. Thus, in the\nRepublic, he dismisses the study of the visible heaven from\nthe curriculum of higher learning along with audible music. But such\ngeneralizations about Plato’s intentions may be misleading. What\nhe denigrates is not the study of the heavenly order as such, nor that\nof harmonics; it is rather the extent to which we must necessarily\nrely on our eyes and ears in those concerns. Students of philosophy\nare, rather, encouraged to work out the true intelligible order\nunderlying the visible heaven and audible music. Not only that: The\nascent out of the Cave includes recognition of objects outside,\nespecially “the things in the sky” (R.\n516a–b). If Plato is critical of natural science, it is because\nof its empirical approach. This echoes the Phaedo’s\ncomplaint that one ruins one’s eyes by looking directly at\nthings, most of all at the sun (Phdo. 99d–e).\nNevertheless, Plato already indicates in his critique of Anaxagoras\nthat comprehension of the workings of the order of nature would be\nhighly desirable, as long as it contained an explanation of the\nrationale of that order (98a): “I was ready to find out\nabout the sun and the moon and the other heavenly bodies, about their\nrelative speed, their turnings and whatever happens to them, how it is\nbest that each should be acted upon.” But Anaxagoras\nhas not fulfilled his promise to explain how mind is the cause of all\nthings by showing (99c): “that the truly good and binding ties\nand holds everything together”, i.e. through a teleological\nrather than a mechanical explanation of the cosmic order. Plato\nhimself does not pursue this idea in the rest of the Phaedo,\nbut his elaborate ‘geographical’ depiction of the under-,\nmiddle-, and upper world in the final myth can be read as a model of\nsuch an explanation in mythological garb. The same can be claimed for\nthe description of the heavenly order and the structure of the\n‘spindle of necessity’ in the myth of Er at the end of the\nRepublic (R. 616b–617d). \nWhat kind of ‘binding force’ does Plato attribute to\n‘the Good’? His reticence about this concept, despite its\ncentrality in his metaphysics and ethics, is largely responsible for\nthe obscurity of his concepts of happiness and of what it is to lead a\ngood life, except for the claim that individuals are best off if they\n‘do their own thing’. The philosophers’ knowledge\nprovides a solid basis for the good life of the entire community, as\nwell as for that of the – perhaps uncomprehending –\nmajority, because they benefit from the good order of the state. But\nwhat is ‘the Good’ that is responsible for the goodness of\nall other things? A lot of ink has been spilt over the following\npassage in Republic book VI, 509b: “Not only do the\nobjects of knowledge owe their being known to the Good, but\ntheir being (ousia) is also due to it, although the\nGood is not being, but superior (epekeina) to it in rank and\npower.” The analogy with the sun’s maintenance of all that\nis alive suggests that the Good is the intelligent inner principle\nthat determines the nature of every object that is capable of\ngoodness, in the sense that these objects fulfill their respective\nfunctions in an appropriate way. Plato did not attempt to state how\nsuch a principle of goodness works in all things when he wrote the\nRepublic. That he was thinking of an internal ‘binding\nforce’ is indicated, however, in Book X, where Plato elucidates\nthe ontological differences that exist, respectively, between the\nForms as the products of a divine maker, their earthly copies, and the\nimitation of these copies by an artist (R. 596a ff.).\nAccording to Plato, in each case it is the use or\nfunction that determines what it is to be good, (601d):\n“Aren’t the virtue or excellence, the beauty and\ncorrectness of each manufactured item, living creature, and action\nrelated to nothing but the use (chreia) for which each is\nmade or naturally adapted?” Given that he does not limit this\naccount to instruments, but explicitly includes living things and\nhuman actions in it, he seems to have a specific criterion in mind for\nwhat constitutes each thing’s excellence. A similar thought is\nalready expressed in Republic I (353a–e) when Socrates,\nin his refutation of Thrasymachus, employs the argument that the\nability to fulfill one’s own task (ergon) well\nconstitutes the excellence of each object. In the case of human\nbeings, this means ‘doing well’; ‘doing well’,\nin turn, means ‘living well’, and ‘living\nwell’, in turn, means ‘living happily’. The\nstringency of these inferences is far from obvious; but they show that\nPlato saw an intimate connection between the nature, the function, and\nthe well-being of all things, including human beings. \nWhat determines the ‘use’ of a human being, and to what\nextent can there be a common principle that accounts for all good\nthings? In the Republic, this question is answered only\nindirectly through the isomorphism of the just state and soul as a\nharmonious internal order. The postulate of such an orderly structure\nis not explicitly extended beyond the state and the soul. In contrast,\nin the later dialogues, the Good clearly operates on a cosmic scale.\nThat such is Plato’s view comes to the fore in his excursus on\nthe philosopher’s nature in the Theaetetus\n(173c–177c). Contrary to Socrates’ denial in the\nApology, Socrates in the Theaetetus affirms that the\nphilosopher is to pursue both what lies below the earth and the\nheights above the heaven (173e): “tracking down by every path\nthe entire nature of each whole among the things that are.” And\nSocrates also concerns himself with the question of “What is\nman? What actions and passions properly belong to human nature and\ndistinguish it from all other beings?” In that connection he\ncompares the discovery of the true nature of things with\n‘likening oneself to God’ (homoiôsis\ntheôi) and indicates that there is a unitary principle of\ngoodness. The ability to achieve this superhuman state depends on\none’s readiness to engage in strenuous philosophical discourse\n(177b). \nIf, in the Republic, the goodness of the individual soul is\nexplained in terms of its being a smaller copy of a harmonious\nsociety, in the Timaeus, Plato goes for a larger model. The\nuniverse now supplies the ‘large’ text for deciphering the\nnature of the human soul. The structure of the world-soul is\nreplicated in the nature of the human soul. That there is,\nnevertheless, a close affinity between the Republic and the\nproject that Plato meant to pursue in the Timaeus and its\nintended sequels is clearly indicated in the preface to the\nTimaeus. The tale of the origin of the universe, including\nhuman nature, is presented as the first step in a reply to\nSocrates’ wish to see his own best city ‘in action’\n(Ti. 19b–c). From antiquity on, this introduction has\ncreated the impression that the Timaeus is the direct\ncontinuation of the Republic, an impression that explains its\njuxtaposition in the Corpus Platonicum. Strong indications\nspeak, however, for a much later date for the Timaeus. If\nPlato establishes a link between these two works, his intent is to\ncompare as well as to contrast. The continuity consists solely in the\nfact that Socrates reaffirms that he still considers his city’s\norder as the best (Ti. 17c–19b). It is this ideal order\nthat Critias promises to illustrate by narrating the tale of the war\nbetween pre-historic Athens, a city that exempified the ideal order,\nand Atlantis, a powerful tyrannical superpower (Ti.\n20d–26e). However, Plato eventually set aside the project of\nillustrating the ideal city in action: the Critias breaks off\nafter 15 pages, in mid-sentence, and the third dialogue in the series,\nHermocrates, was never written at all. So the story of\nSocrates’ ideal city in action and of the life of its citizens\nremains untold. All we have is Plato’s cosmic model. \nThe difference between the philosophical approach of the\nRepublic and that of the Timaeus lies in the fact\nthat Plato concerns himself in the later dialogue with the structure\nof the visible heaven as a model for the human soul, and also with the\nmaterial conditions of human physiology. What is confined to mythology\nin Plato’s earlier works is here worked out – though not\nwithout the caveat to the effect that Plato is merely\noffering a likely account of the structure of the universe, of the\nhuman soul, and of human physiology – rather than proven facts.\nPlato’s choice of presenting his explanation of the order of the\nuniverse as a story of creation by a ‘divine workman’ is\ncertainly no accident. It can be understood as a kind of\n‘retractation’ of his deprecatory statement concerning the\ndivine workman’s product that appears in the Republic,\nwhere this product is denigrated because of its inferiority to a\npurely theoretical model. To be sure, the Timaeus presupposes\nthe Forms as the divine workman’s unchanging models\n(27d–29d; 30c–31b) and resorts to mathematical principles\nto explain the cosmic order, but the focus is almost exclusively on\nthe construction of the visible heavens. Plato now seems convinced\nthat in order to explain the nature of a living being, it is necessary\nto show what factors constitute such a live organism.  \nThis intention explains certain peculiarities of the Timaeus\nthat make the dialogue hard to penetrate. For the dialogue falls into\nthree rather disparate parts. The first part describes the structure\nof the world-soul and its replication in the human soul in a way that\ncombines the formal principles with those of mathematics and harmonics\nand illustrates it with fantastic imagery (29d–47e). The second\npart consists of a rather meticulous account of the elementary\nphysical constituents of nature, which are held to be formed of\ngeometrically constructed atoms (47e–69a). The third part\ncombines elements from the first and second parts in a lengthy\nexplanation of human physiology and psychology (69b–92c). The\nfirst, cosmological, part of the Timaeus greatly taxes\none’s ability to relate the notion of a divinely created\nworld-soul to the motions of the visible heavens, since Plato only\noffers the bare hints of an intelligible, mathematical, and harmonic\nstructure that would explain these motions. By contrast, the\nexplanations in the second and third part are hard to follow because\nof Plato’s, quite unique, concern with detail with respect to\nnature. \nThis is not the place to summarize Plato’s description of the\ncomplex structure of the world-soul at greater length. Suffice it to\nsay that this structure combines three features – namely, (1)\nthe components or ingredients, of the world-soul itself, which are the\nessential tools for dialectic; (2) the mathematical\nproportions that define the structure of the world-soul; and (3) the\ninfluence that the structure of the world-soul has in turn on the\nobservable order of the universe, such as the motion of the heavenly\nbodies. According to Plato, the soul itself is composed of being,\nsameness, and difference – i.e., three of the ‘most\nimportant kinds’ discussed in the Sophist as the\nobjects of the philosopher’s art of combination and separation\n(Sph. 253b–254b). Each of the three concepts that\nconstitute the world-soul do so in a mixture of their unchangeable and\ntheir changeable types (Ti. 35a–b): the world-soul is a\ncombination of unchangeable and changeable being, of unchangeable and\nchangeable sameness, and of unchangeable and changeable difference.\nWhat is the use of this strange concoction? As Timaeus points out, the\ncombination of the eternal and temporal versions of the formal\nconcepts allows the soul to comprehend both unchangeable and\nchangeable objects in the world (37a–c). In other words, the\nsoul has ‘unchangeable’ tools to identify the Forms, and\n‘changeable’ tools to deal with the objects in the\nphysical realm. By mixing together the unchangeable and the changeable\nversions of the formal concepts, Plato maintains the unity of the\nsoul. In other words, there is no such thing as a\nworld-reason – dealing only with eternal being,\nsameness and difference – separate from the world-soul,\nwhich is concerned with temporal and changeable things, their being,\nsameness and difference. Rather, there is one mental force that does\nboth, resulting in either knowledge or firm belief. Nous and\npsuchê are united in the Timaeus. The\n‘mixed tools’ of dialectic (once more – being,\nsameness, and difference) are at the same time depicted as extended\n‘bands’ that provide the soul with a mathematical\nstructure through division in a complex set of proportions\n(35b–36b). The portions (1 - 2 - 4 - 8 - 3 - 9 - 27) of the\nmixture, with further subdivisions according to the arithmetical,\ngeometrical and harmonic means, are the proportions that demarcate the\nintervals in theoretical harmonics (1 : 2 is the ratio underlying the\noctave, 3 : 2 the fifth, 4 : 3 the fourth, 9 : 8 the major second,\netc.). As these harmonic divisions suggest, the world-soul is at the\nsame time a kind of musical instrument. No music of the spheres is\nmentioned in the Timaeus, but Plato seems to have in mind at\nleast the possibility of heavenly music. The mathematical proportions\nare applied, in turn, to explain the order and the motions of the\nheavenly bodies (36b–d). For the soul-bands, divided in\ndifferent proportions, form circles that are ordered in a complicated\nsystem, and in doing so they represent a geometrical model of the\nmotions and distances of the stars revolving around the earth. \nWhy does Plato burden himself and his readers with such a complex\nmachinery and what does this heavenly instrument have to do with\nethics? Since the human soul is formed from the same ingredients as\nthe world soul (albeit in a less pure form), and displays the same\nstructure (41d–e), Plato is clearly not just concerned with the\norder of the universe, but with that of the human soul as well. He\nattributes to it the possession of the kinds of concepts that are\nnecessary for the understanding of the nature of all things, both\neternal and temporal. The soul’s ingredients are here limited to\nthe purely formal conditions, however. A theory of recollection of the\nnature of all things is no longer being advocated. Rather, Plato is\nconcerned with ascertaining all of the following: (1) the most\nimportant concepts used to identify and differentiate objects in the\nway necessary for dialectical procedure; (2) the numbers and\nproportions needed to understand numerical relations and harmonic\nstructures of all sorts; and (3) the capacity of the soul to perform\nand comprehend harmoniously coordinated motions. This, it seems, is\nall the soul gets and all it needs in order to perform its various\ntasks. The unusual depiction of the soul’s composition makes it\nhard, at first, to penetrate to the rationale of its construction, and\nit must remain an open question to what extent Plato expects his model\nto be taken in a literal rather than in a figurative sense. His\noverall message should be clear, however: the soul is a\nharmoniously structured entity, that can in principle function\nforever, and it also comprehends the corresponding structures\nin other entities, and therefore has access to all that is good and\nwell-ordered. This last point has consequences for his ethical thought\nthat are not developed in the Timaeus itself, but that can be\ndetected in other late dialogues. \nPlato’s concern with ‘right measure’ in a sense that\nis relevant for ethics is, of course, not confined to his late work.\nIt shows up rather early. Already in the Gorgias, Socrates\nblames Callicles for the undisciplined state of his soul, and\nattributes it to his neglect of geometry, (508a): “You’ve\nfailed to notice that proportionate equality (geometrikê\nisotês) has great power among both gods and men.” But\nit is unclear whether this expression is to be taken in a more than\nmetaphorical sense; it is, at any rate, not repeated anywhere else in\nPlato’s earlier work. Numbers are treated as paradigmatic\nentities from the middle dialogues on, and in the Protagoras\n(156c–157e), Socrates maintains that virtue is ‘the art of\nmeasuring’ (metrêtikê technê)\npleasure and pain. But nothing further is made of that suggestion; the\ndialogue ends in aporia about the nature of virtue\n(161c–d) — a fact that strongly speaks against the\nattribution of a kind of ‘enlightened hedonism’ to Plato,\nas certain interpreters are wont to do. There is no indication that\nPlato takes seriously the idea of a ‘quantification’ of\nthe nature of the virtues in his middle dialogues. If mathematics\nlooms large, then, it is as a model science on account of its\nexactness, the stability of its objects, and their accessibility to\nreason. A systematic exploration of the notion that measure and\nproportion are the fundamental conditions of goodness is confined to\nthe late dialogues. Apart from the Timaeus’ emphasis on\na precise cosmic and mental order, there is a crucial passage in the\nStatesman (283d–285c), where the Eleatic Stranger\ndistinguishes two kinds of ‘art of measurement’. The first\nkind is the ordinary measuring of quantities relative to each other\n(‘the great and small’). The second kind has a normative\ncomponent; it is concerned with the determination of ‘due\nmeasure’ (to metrion). The latter is treated with great\nconcern, for the Eleatic Stranger claims that it is the basis of all\nexpertise, including statesmanship, the very art that is the subject\nof the dialogue itself, (284a–b): “It is by preserving\nmeasure in this way that they produce all the good and fine things\nthey do produce.” His point is that all good productions and all\nprocesses of generation that come to a good end presuppose\n‘right measure’, while arbitrary quantities (‘the\nmore and less’) have no such results. The Eleatic Stranger\ntherefore suggests the separation of the simple arts of measuring from\nthe arts concerned with due measure, (284e): “Positing as one\npart all those sorts of expertise that measure the numbers, lengths,\ndepths, breadths and speeds of things in relation to what is opposed\nto them, and as the other, all those that measure in relation to what\nis in due measure (to metrion), what is fitting (to\nprepon), the right moment (to kairion), what is as it\nought to be (to deon)—everything that is removed from\nthe extremes to the middle (meson).” This distinction\nis not applied in the Statesman itself, except that due\nmeasure seems to be presupposed in the final definition of the\nstatesman as a ‘kingly weaver’, weaving together the\nfabric of the state by combining the aggressive and the moderate\ntemperaments of the population so as to produce a harmonious citizenry\n(305e– 311c). But mathematics is not mentioned as the condition\nof the ‘mixing of the citizens’ characters’.  \nThe importance of measure in a literal sense becomes more explicit,\nhowever, in the Philebus, the dialogue that is concerned with\nthe question of whether pleasure or knowledge constitutes the human\ngood. In that dialogue, number (arithmos), measure\n(metron), and limit (peras) play a crucial role at\nvarious points of the discussion, and the Philebus is the\ndialogue where Plato requires that numerical precision must be\nobserved in the application of the ‘divine gift’ of\ndialectical procedure by the method of collection and division\n(16c–17a). The dialectician must know precisely how many species\nand subspecies a certain genus contains; otherwise he has no claim to\nany kind of expertise. Despite this emphasis on precision and on the\nneed to determine the numerical ‘limit’ in every science,\nSocrates does not provide the envisaged kind of numerically complete\ndivision of the two contenders for the rank of the best state of the\nhuman soul – pleasure and knowledge – envisaged by the use\nof collection and division. This is because Socrates suddenly\nremembers that neither of the two contenders suffices in itself for\nthe good life, and that a mixture of the two is preferable. To explain\nthe nature of this mixture, Socrates introduces a fourfold division of\nall beings (23c–27c), a division that uses the categories of\n‘limit’ and ‘measure’ in a different way than\nin the ‘divine method of dialectic’. As he now states, all\nbeings belong in one of four classes – namely (1) limit\n(peras), (2) the unlimited (apeiron), (3) the\nmixture (meixis) of limit and the unlimited, or (4) the cause\n(aitia) of such a mixture. As the subsequent explications\nconcerning the four classes show, the unlimited comprises all those\nthings that have no exact grade or measure in themselves, such as the\nhotter and colder, the faster and slower. Although at first the\nexamples are confined to relative terms, the class of the unlimited is\nthen extended to things like hot and cold, dry and moist, fast and\nslow, and even heat and frost. Mixture takes place when such qualities\ntake on a definite quantity (poson) or due measure\n(metrion) that limits their variation. That only measured\nentities qualify as mixtures is not only suggested by the examples\nSocrates refers to (health, strength, beauty, music, and the seasons),\nbut by his assertion much later in the dialogue that a mixture without\ndue measure or proportion does not deserve its name (64d–e):\n“[it] will necessarily corrupt its ingredients and most of all\nitself. For there would be no blending in such cases at all, but\nreally an unconnected medley, the ruin of whatever happens to be\ncontained in it.” The upshot of this discussion is that all\nstable entities (mixtures) represent a harmonious equilibrium of their\notherwise unlimited ingredients. Since indeterminate elements usually\nturn up in pairs of opposites, the right limit in each case is the\nright proportion necessary for their balance. In the case of health,\nthere must be the right balance between the hot and the cold, the dry\nand the moist. The cause of the proper proportion for each mixture\nturns out to be reason; it is the only member of the fourth class. As\nSocrates indicates, divine reason is the ultimate source of all that\nis good and harmonious in the universe, while human reason is but a\npoor copy (26e–27c; 28a–30e). \nThe adoption of this fourfold ontology allows Socrates to assign the\ntwo contenders for best condition in human nature to two of the four\nclasses: pleasure turns out to be unlimited, because it admits of the\n‘more and less ’. Reason, by contrast, belongs to the\nfourth class, as the cause of good mixtures. On the basis of this\nclassification, Socrates’ investigation provides a critical\nassessment of different kinds of pleasure and knowledge\n(31b–59d). It turns out that pleasure is at best a remedial\ngood: pleasure is always the filling of a lack, or the restoration of\na harmonious state, and therefore pleasure presupposes some kind of\ndisturbance of the physical or mental equilibrium. A pleasure may be\nfalse, harmful or violent if its pursuer is mistaken about the\nobject’s identity and quantity, or if there is no real cure for\nthe disturbance. A pleasure may be ‘true and pure’ if it\nis a compensation for a harmless and unfelt lack, and if its possessor\nis not mistaken about the nature of its object (31b–55c). The\nrivals of the pleasures – the different intellectual disciplines\n– also vary in quality; but in their case the difference in\nquality depends on the amount of mathematical precision they contain\n(55c–59d). The decision about what mixture will make for a happy\nlife leads to a combination of the true and pure pleasures with all\nthe kinds of knowledge and disciplines that are necessary for\nlife’s needs (59d–64b). In the final ranking of goods,\nmeasure and due proportion, unsurprisingly, get the first rank, things\nin proper proportion come in second, reason is ranked third, the arts\nand sciences obtain fourth place, whereas the true and pure pleasures\nget fifth and last place on the scale of goods (64c–67b). If\nPlato in the Philebus is more favorably disposed towards a\nhedonist stance than in some of his earlier works, he is so only to a\nquite limited degree: he regards pleasure as a necessary ingredient in\nhuman life, because both the physical and the psychic equilibria that\nconstitute human nature are unstable. There is always some deficiency\nor lack that needs supplementing. Because the range of such\n‘supplements’ include learning and the pursuit of the\nvirtues, there are some pleasures that are rightly cherished. But even\nthey are deemed goods only because they are compensations for human\nimperfection. \nWhat are we to make of this conception of happiness as a mixture of\npleasure and knowledge that is based on ‘due measurement’?\nThere are two questions worth exploring here. One concerns the role\nthat Plato assigns to measure in his late concept of ethics. Secondly,\nthere is the question of how serious Plato is about such a\n‘mathematization’ of his principles, quite generally.  \nRegardning the issue of the role of measure in Plato’s ethics,\nthough harmony and order are treated as important principles in\nPlato’s metaphysics and ethics from early on, in his late\ndialogues he seems to envisage right measure in a literal sense. This\nexplains his confidence that even physical entities can attain a\nrelatively stable state. As he specifies both in the Timaeus\nand in the Philebus, not everything is in a hopeless constant\nflux; on the contrary, those things that possess the measure that is\nright for their type are stable entities and can be the objects of\n‘firm and true beliefs and convictions’ (Ti.\n37b–c). This applies not only to the nature of the visible\nuniverse, but also to the human body and mind, as long as they are in\ngood condition. Plato seems to have been encouraged to embrace such\ntheories by the advances of astronomy and harmonics in his own\nlifetime, so that he postulates ‘due proportion’ in an\narithmetical sense as the cause of all harmony and stability. His\nconfidence seems to have extended not only to the physical, but also\nto the moral state of human nature. That assumption is confirmed not\nonly by the emphasis on right mixture in the Philebus, but\nalso by the the discussion in the Laws about how the laws are\nto achieve peace in the state and harmony in the souls of the\ncitizens. In the Laws it seems that Plato no longer regards\nthe emotions as a menace to the virtues; rather, he sees it as the\nlegislators’ obligation to provide an adequate balance of\npleasure and pain by habituating citizens in the right way\n(632a–643a). This balance, through paideia, is crucial\nfor maintaining a truly free soul (I 636e): “Pleasure and pain\nflow like two springs released by nature. If a man draws the right\namount from the right one at the right time, he lives a happy\nlife.” This is not the place to discuss the project Plato\npursues in the Laws as a whole, which ist to determine the\nbest possible constitution and its laws. Suffice it to note that the\ndiscussion of the right measure of pleasure and pain forms the preface\nto the entire project. This is an indication of a considerable shift\nof emphasis on the emotions in the Laws compared with\nPlato’s treatment of the subject in the Republic. For\nthe form of education that provides the citizens with the right\nhabituation (ethos) concerning the measure of pleasure and\npain is the topic of the Laws’ second book. The\nemphasis put on the right measure and on the right object of pleasure\nand pain in the citizens’ sentimental education to some degree\nanticipates the Aristotelian conception of the moral virtues as the\nright mean between excess and deficiency (II 653b–c):\n“Virtue is this general concord of reason and emotion. But there\nis one element you could isolate in any account you give, and this is\nthe correct formation of our feelings of pleasure and pain, which\nmakes us hate what we ought to hate from first to last, and love what\nwe ought to love.” The confidence expressed in the Laws\nin the power of due measure in all matters finally culminates in the\nfamous maxim that God is the measure of all things (IV 716c–d:\n“In our view, it is God who is preeminently the ‘measure\nof all things’, much more so than any man, as they say. So if\nyou want to recommend yourself to someone of this character, you must\ndo your level best to make your own character reflect his, and on this\nprinciple the moderate man is God’s friend, being like him,\nwhereas the immoderate and unjust man is not like him and is his\nenemy; and the same reasoning applies to the other vices too.”\nBecause Plato, like Aristotle after him, carefully refrains from any\nkind of specifications about what actual right measures might be, we\nshould treat the ‘arithmetic’ of the good life with more\nthan a pinch of salt. That individuals differ in their internal and\nexternal conditions is as clear to Plato as it is to Aristotle. This\ndoes not shake his faith in the Laws that right habituation\nthrough the right kind of education, most of all in the arts, will\nprovide the necessary inner equilibrium in the good citizen.  \nAs to the second question concerning the extent to which Plato\nbelieved that ethics was amenable to quantification, stated earlier,\nPlato’s confidence in a mathematically structured order of the\nuniverse that also includes human nature was greatly enhanced by the\nprogress made by the scientists of his day. This seems to be the\nrationale for his depiction in the Timaeus of the\nworld’s creation as a construction by a divine craftsman who\nmakes use of proportion, and who also takes care to give a geometrical\nconstruction to the four elements (a factor left out of consideration\nhere). This conviction is echoed in the Philebus’\nemphasis on measure and proportion as the ultimate criteria of\ngoodness. It should be noted, however, that Plato carefully refrains\nfrom going into any specifics about concrete mathematical relations.\nEven in the Timaeus, he does not apply his complicated system\nof proportions when it comes to specifying the actual size, distance,\nand speed of the heavenly bodies. Nor does he indicate in the\nPhilebus how the art of establishing the limits of good\nmixtures should be attained. It therefore remains an open question to\nwhat extent Plato regarded mathematical physics and metaphysics as\nviable projects. That Plato went some way in that direction seems to\nbe indicated by claims in later reports on his theory of the Forms,\nthat he either treated the Forms as numbers or associated numbers with\nthem. Because Aristotle is quite vociferous in his criticism of this\ntheory in Book A of the Metaphysics (A 6; A 9) and further\nexpands his criticism of ideas as numbers or idea-numbers in books M\nand N, there must be some substance to that claim. As the obscurities\nin Aristotle’s various reports indicate, the doctrine cannot\never have reached a definitive stage, for at one point he complains\nthat Plato’s theory relied on too few numbers (Met.\n1084a10–27), while elsewhere he objects that, (1073a20):\n“they speak of numbers now as unlimited, now as limited by the\nnumber 10.” That Plato never presented this theory in a\nmagisterial form is confirmed by the reports on his public\n‘lecture on the good’. It scandalized the general audience\nbecause Plato, instead of speaking about the good in the ordinary\nsense, as expected by the uninformed public, spoke about mathematics\nand “finally, that the Good is one” (cf. Aristoxenos,\nHarmonica, II, 30). But it was not just the general public\nwho found the message hard to comprehend. As Simplicius reports, even\nPlato’s mature students – such as Aristotle, Heraclides\nPonticus, and Hestiaeus – took notes on the lecture,\n“because it was stated enigmatically”. Simplicius also\nreports that Porphyry, his source, used the Philebus to\nunravel the enigma (In Aristotelis physica 453,29). Given the\ndisagreements in our sources, it may forever remain a matter of debate\nhow far Plato went in his mathematization of his ethics and\nmetaphysics. It seems clear, however, that he must at least have\nentertained the hope that all that is good rests on ‘due\nmeasure’ in a more than metaphorical sense. We may well ask why\nhe shouldered his philosophy with such heavy baggage that made it\ninaccessible to the mathematically untrained, an inaccessibility that\nlargely persists to this day and age. Clearly, there is one conviction\nthat Plato never gave up: The nature of all things requires knowledge,\nand that condition applies most of all to the Good. And if it takes\nmathematical knowledge to comprehend what is good, then that is the\nway to go. \nThe speculative character of Plato’s metaphysical thought may\nexplain why, in his late works, his treatment of ethics strikes us as\nless rigid, and as more ready to come to terms with the complexity of\nhuman nature, and with the ordinary requirements for a satisfactory\nlife. Signs of this more conciliatory stance can be seen in the\ndepiction of a mixed life in the Philebus, which is a life\nopen to everyone, as well as in the portrayal in the Laws of\nthe city-state of Magnesia, which is depicted as the second-best\nstate, but as a one that is more accommodating to ordinary human\nnature. It is a state that is no longer divided into three classes,\nand where there are no philosopher-kings and -queens in control of\neverything; the heavy work is done by slaves of foreign origin. The\n‘overseers’ over the laws are chosen from the most upright\nand experienced of the citizenry. That they meet in a ‘Nocturnal\nCouncil’ is not for secrecy’s sake, but because during the\nday they have the same occupations as all other citizens. If Plato\ndoes not assign unlimited power to a special class it is for two\nreasons: he recognizes that persons of super-human virtue are not easy\nto find and that scientific education and philosophy alone are no\nwarranty of goodness. Plato no longer expects any human being to be\nimmune to the temptations of power. Therefore, in Book V of the\nLaws he recommends a mixed constitution and a\n‘nomocracy’ as being more appropriate than a monarchy of\nthe best minds. Humans are to be servants of the laws, not masters of\neach other. It may seem paradoxical that Plato became more\nconciliatory towards the ordinary human condition at the same time as\nhis confidence in scientific rigor increased. But there actually is no\nparadox. His conciliatory stance seems, rather, to reflect his insight\nthat, the more complex things get, the less precision is to be\nattained. Therefore no mathematical precision can be expected in the\nordering of such complex mixtures as the human soul and life.\n‘Due measure’, as applied to the human condition must\ntherefore be given some leeway, “if ever we are to find our way\nhome”, as Plato lets Socrates’ partner conclude in the\nPhilebus. That ethics cannot be done with the same precision\nas mathematics is not, then, an insight that occurred only to\nAristotle. But Plato must have thought that precision should at least\nbe aimed for, if life is to be based on a harmonious order that is\naccessible, at least to a certain degree, to human knowledge.  \nDid Plato’ view of the human good, then, become more democratic\nin his latest works? If we follow the indications in the\nTimaeus concerning the good state of the human soul in\n‘orderly circles’, Plato seems to remain as elitist as\never. But he no longer puts so much emphasis on the distance between\nthe best and the ordinary. As he remarks in the Statesman,\neven the most gifted statesmen don’t stick out from the rest of\nhumankind like queen-bees do from ordinary bees. Further, the souls of\nall human beings are at best only ‘second-best souls’ when\ncompared with the world-soul. That all human beings have to seek the\nbest obtainable mixture of life, and even the best of them can be no\nmore than servants of the laws, suggests that Plato has become more\ndemocratic in the sense that he regards the ‘human herd’\nas a more uniform flock than he did in his earlier days. He retains\nhis conviction, however, that a well-ordered soul is the prerequisite\nof the good life and that human beings need not only a careful moral\neducation, but also a well-regulated life. Whether the life in\nPlato’s nomocracy would better please the modern mind than rule\nby philosopher-kings, however, is a question that would require a\ncareful perusal of that enormous compendium of regulations and laws,\nthe study of which makes the task of reading and understanding the\nLaws such hard work. That compendium is at the same time a\nsourcebook for all those interested in Plato’s late moral\nthought.","contact.mail":"dorothea.frede@uni-hamburg.de","contact.domain":"uni-hamburg.de"}]
