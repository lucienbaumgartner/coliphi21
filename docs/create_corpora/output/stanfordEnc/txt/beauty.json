Beauty has traditionally been counted among the ultimate\nvalues, with goodness, truth, and justice. It is a primary theme among\nancient Greek, Hellenistic, and medieval philosophers, and was central\nto eighteenth and nineteenth-century thought, as represented in\ntreatments by such thinkers as Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, Hume, Burke,\nKant, Schiller, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Hanslick, and Santayana. By the\nbeginning of the twentieth century, beauty was in decline as a subject\nof philosophical inquiry, and also as a primary goal of the arts.\nHowever, there were signs of revived interest by the early 2000s.\n\n\nThis article will begin with a sketch of the debate over whether\nbeauty is objective or subjective, which is perhaps the single\nmost-prosecuted disagreement in the literature. It will proceed to set\nout some of the major approaches to or theories of beauty developed\nwithin Western philosophical and artistic traditions.\n\nPerhaps the most familiar basic issue in the theory of beauty is\nwhether beauty is subjective—located ‘in the eye of the\nbeholder’—or whether it is an objective feature of\nbeautiful things. A pure version of either of these positions seems\nimplausible, for reasons we will examine, and many attempts have been\nmade to split the difference or incorporate insights of both\nsubjectivist and objectivist accounts. Ancient and medieval accounts\nfor the most part located beauty outside of anyone's particular\nexperiences. Nevertheless, that beauty is subjective was also a\ncommonplace from the time of the sophists. By the eighteenth century,\nHume could write as follows, expressing one ‘species of\nphilosophy’: \nBeauty is no quality in things themselves: It exists merely in the\nmind which contemplates them; and each mind perceives a different\nbeauty. One person may even perceive deformity, where another is\nsensible of beauty; and every individual ought to acquiesce in his own\nsentiment, without pretending to regulate those of others. (Hume 1757,\n136) \nAnd Kant launches his discussion of the matter in The Critique of\nJudgment (the Third Critique) at least as emphatically: \nThe judgment of taste is therefore not a judgment of cognition, and is\nconsequently not logical but aesthetical, by which we understand that\nwhose determining ground can be no other than subjective.\nEvery reference of representations, even that of sensations, may be\nobjective (and then it signifies the real [element] of an empirical\nrepresentation), save only the reference to the feeling of pleasure\nand pain, by which nothing in the object is signified, but through\nwhich there is a feeling in the subject as it is affected by the\nrepresentation. (Kant 1790, section 1)  \nHowever, if beauty is entirely subjective—that is, if anything\nthat anyone holds to be or experiences as beautiful is beautiful (as\nJames Kirwan, for example, asserts)—then it seems that the word\nhas no meaning, or that we are not communicating anything when we call\nsomething beautiful except perhaps an approving personal attitude. In\naddition, though different persons can of course differ in particular\njudgments, it is also obvious that our judgments coincide to a\nremarkable extent: it would be odd or perverse for any person to deny\nthat a perfect rose or a dramatic sunset was beautiful. And it is\npossible actually to disagree and argue about whether something is\nbeautiful, or to try to show someone that something is beautiful, or\nlearn from someone else why it is. \nOn the other hand, it seems senseless to say that beauty has no\nconnection to subjective response or that it is entirely objective.\nThat would seem to entail, for example, that a world with no\nperceivers could be beautiful or ugly, or perhaps that beauty could be\ndetected by scientific instruments. Even if it could be, beauty would\nseem to be connected to subjective response, and though we may argue\nabout whether something is beautiful, the idea that one's experiences\nof beauty might be disqualified as simply inaccurate or false might\narouse puzzlement as well as hostility. We often regard other people's\ntaste, even when it differs from our own, as provisionally entitled to\nsome respect, as we may not, for example, in cases of moral,\npolitical, or factual opinions. All plausible accounts of beauty\nconnect it to a pleasurable or profound or loving response, even if\nthey do not locate beauty purely in the eye of the beholder. \nUntil the eighteenth century, most philosophical accounts of beauty\ntreated it as an objective quality: they located it in the beautiful\nobject itself or in the qualities of that object. In De Veritate\nReligione, Augustine asks explicitly whether things are beautiful\nbecause they give delight, or whether they give delight because they\nare beautiful; he emphatically opts for the second (Augustine, 247).\nPlato's account in the Symposium and Plotinus's in the\nEnneads connect beauty to a response of love and desire, but\nlocate beauty itself in the realm of the Forms, and the beauty of\nparticular objects in their participation in the Form. Indeed,\nPlotinus's account in one of its moments makes beauty a matter of what\nwe might term ‘formedness’: having the definite shape\ncharacteristic of the kind of thing the object is. \nWe hold that all the loveliness of this world comes by communion in\nIdeal-Form. All shapelessness whose kind admits of pattern and form,\nas long as it remains outside of Reason and Idea, is ugly from that\nvery isolation from the Divine-Thought. And this is the Absolute Ugly:\nan ugly thing is something that has not been entirely mastered by\npattern, that is by Reason, the Matter not yielding at all points and\nin all respects to Ideal-Form. But where the Ideal-Form has entered,\nit has grouped and coordinated what from a diversity of parts was to\nbecome a unity: it has rallied confusion into co-operation: it has\nmade the sum one harmonious coherence: for the Idea is a unity and\nwhat it moulds must come into unity as far as multiplicity may.\n(Plotinus, 22 [Ennead I, 6]) \nIn this account, beauty is at least as objective as any other concept,\nor indeed takes on a certain ontological priority as more real than\nparticular Forms: it is a sort of Form of Forms. \nThough Plato and Aristotle disagree on what beauty is, they both\nregard it as objective in the sense that it is not localized in the\nresponse of the beholder. The classical conception\n (see below)\n treats beauty as a matter of instantiating definite proportions or\nrelations among parts, sometimes expressed in mathematical ratios, for\nexample the ‘golden section.’ The sculpture known as\n‘The Canon,’ by Polykleitos (fifth/fourth century BCE),\nwas held up as a model of harmonious proportion to be emulated by\nstudents and masters alike: beauty could be reliably achieved by\nreproducing its objective proportions. Nevertheless, it is\nconventional in ancient treatments of the topic also to pay tribute to\nthe pleasures of beauty, often described in quite ecstatic terms, as\nin Plotinus: “This is the spirit that Beauty must ever induce:\nwonderment and a delicious trouble, longing and love and a trembling\nthat is all delight” (Plotinus 23, [Ennead 1, 3]). \nAt latest by the eighteenth century, however, and particularly in the\nBritish Isles, beauty was associated with pleasure in a somewhat\ndifferent way: pleasure was held to be not the effect but the origin\nof beauty. This was influenced, for example, by Locke's distinction\nbetween primary and secondary qualities. Locke and the other\nempiricists treated color (which is certainly one source or locus of\nbeauty), for example, as a ‘phantasm’ of the mind, as a\nset of qualities dependent on subjective response, located in the\nperceiving mind rather than of the world outside the mind. Without\nperceivers of a certain sort, there would be no colors. One argument\nfor this was the variation in color experiences between people. For\nexample, some people are color-blind, and to a person with jaundice\nmuch of the world takes on a yellow cast. In addition, the same object\nis perceived as having different colors by the same the person under\ndifferent conditions: at noon and midnight, for example. Such\nvariations are conspicuous in experiences of beauty as well. \nNevertheless, eighteenth-century philosophers such as Hume and Kant\nperceived that something important was lost when beauty was treated\nmerely as a subjective state. They saw, for example, that\ncontroversies often arise about the beauty of particular things, such\nas works of art and literature, and that in such controversies,\nreasons can sometimes be given and will sometimes be found convincing.\nThey saw, as well, that if beauty is completely relative to individual\nexperiencers, it ceases to be a paramount value, or even recognizable\nas a value at all across persons or societies. \nHume's “Of the Standard of Taste” and Kant's Critique\nOf Judgment attempt to find ways through what has been termed\n‘the antinomy of taste.’ Taste is proverbially subjective:\nde gustibus non est disputandum (about taste there is no\ndisputing). On the other hand, we do frequently dispute about matters\nof taste, and some persons are held up as exemplars of good taste or\nof tastelessness. Some people's tastes appear vulgar or ostentatious,\nfor example. Some people's taste is too exquisitely refined, while\nthat of others is crude, naive, or non-existent. Taste, that is,\nappears to be both subjective and objective: that is the antinomy. \nBoth Hume and Kant, as we have seen, begin by acknowledging that taste\nor the ability to detect or experience beauty is fundamentally\nsubjective, that there is no standard of taste in the sense that the\nCanon was held to be, that if people did not experience\ncertain kinds of pleasure, there would be no beauty. Both acknowledge\nthat reasons can count, however, and that some tastes are better than\nothers. In different ways, they both treat judgments of beauty neither\nprecisely as purely subjective nor precisely as objective but, as we\nmight put it, as inter-subjective or as having a social and cultural\naspect, or as conceptually entailing an inter-subjective claim to\nvalidity. \nHume's account focuses on the history and condition of the observer as\nhe or she makes the judgment of taste. Our practices with regard to\nassessing people's taste entail that judgments of taste that reflect\nidiosyncratic bias, ignorance, or superficiality are not as good as\njudgments that reflect wide-ranging acquaintance with various objects\nof judgment and are unaffected by arbitrary prejudices. “Strong\nsense, united to delicate sentiment, improved by practice, perfected\nby comparison, and cleared of all prejudice, can alone entitle critics\nto this valuable character; and the joint verdict of such, wherever\nthey are to found, is the true standard of taste and beauty”\n(“Of the Standard of Taste” 1757, 144). \nHume argues further that the verdicts of critics who possess those\nqualities tend to coincide, and approach unanimity in the long run,\nwhich accounts, for example, for the enduring veneration of the works\nof Homer or Milton. So the test of time, as assessed by the verdicts\nof the best critics, functions as something analogous to an objective\nstandard. Though judgments of taste remain fundamentally subjective,\nand though certain contemporary works or objects may appear\nirremediably controversial, the long-run consensus of people who are\nin a good position to judge functions analogously to an objective\nstandard and renders such standards unnecessary even if they could be\nidentified. Though we cannot directly find a standard of beauty that\nsets out the qualities that a thing must possess in order to be\nbeautiful, we can describe the qualities of a good critic or a\ntasteful person. Then the long-run consensus of such persons is the\npractical standard of taste and the means of justifying judgments\nabout beauty. \nKant similarly concedes that taste is fundamentally subjective, that\nevery judgment of beauty is based on a personal experience, and that\nsuch judgments vary from person to person. \nBy a principle of taste I mean a principle under the condition of\nwhich we could subsume the concept of the object, and thus infer, by\nmeans of a syllogism, that the object is beautiful. But that is\nabsolutely impossible. For I must immediately feel the pleasure in the\nrepresentation of the object, and of that I can be persuaded by no\ngrounds of proof whatever. Although, as Hume says, all critics can\nreason more plausibly than cooks, yet the same fate awaits them. They\ncannot expect the determining ground of their judgment [to be derived]\nfrom the force of the proofs, but only from the reflection of the\nsubject upon its own proper state of pleasure or pain. (Kant 1790,\nsection 34) \nBut the claim that something is beautiful has more content merely than\nthat it gives me pleasure. Something might please me for reasons\nentirely eccentric to myself: I might enjoy a bittersweet experience\nbefore a portrait of my grandmother, for example, or the architecture\nof a house might remind me of where I grew up. “No one cares\nabout that,” says Kant (1790, section 7): no one begrudges me\nsuch experiences, but they make no claim to guide or correspond to the\nexperiences of others. \nBy contrast, the judgment that something is beautiful, Kant argues, is\na disinterested judgment. It does not respond to my\nidiosyncrasies, or at any rate if I am aware that it does, I will no\nlonger take myself to be experiencing the beauty per se of the thing\nin question. Somewhat as in Hume—whose treatment Kant evidently\nhad in mind—one must be unprejudiced to come to a genuine\njudgment of taste, and Kant gives that idea a very elaborate\ninterpretation: the judgment must be made independently of the normal\nrange of human desires—economic and sexual desires, for\ninstance, which are examples of our ‘interests’ in this\nsense. If one is walking through a museum and admiring the paintings\nbecause they would be extremely expensive were they to come up for\nauction, for example, or wondering whether one could steal and fence\nthem, one is not having an experience of the beauty of the paintings\nat all. One must focus on the form of the mental representation of the\nobject for its own sake, as it is in itself. Kant summarizes this as\nthe thought that insofar as one is having an experience of the beauty\nof something, one is indifferent to its existence. One takes pleasure,\nrather, in its sheer representation in one's experience: \nNow, when the question is whether something is beautiful, we do not\nwant to know whether anything depends or can depend on the existence\nof the thing, either for myself or anyone else, but how we judge it by\nmere observation (intuition or reflection). … We easily see\nthat, in saying it is beautiful, and in showing that I have\ntaste, I am concerned, not with that in which I depend on the\nexistence of the object, but with that which I make out of this\nrepresentation in myself. Everyone must admit that a judgement about\nbeauty, in which the least interest mingles, is very partial and is\nnot a pure judgement of taste. (Kant 1790, section 2) \nOne important source of the concept of aesthetic disinterestedness is\nthe Third Earl of Shaftesbury's dialogue The Moralists, where\nthe argument is framed in terms of a natural landscape: if you are\nlooking at a beautiful valley primarily as a valuable real estate\nopportunity, you are not seeing it for its own sake, and cannot fully\nexperience its beauty. If you are looking at a lovely woman and\nconsidering her as a possible sexual conquest, you are not able to\nexperience her beauty in the fullest or purest sense; you are\ndistracted from the form as represented in your experience. And\nShaftesbury, too, localizes beauty to the representational capacity of\nthe mind. (Shaftesbury 1738, 222) \nFor Kant, some beauties are dependent—relative to the sort of\nthing the object is—and others are free or absolute. A beautiful\nox would be an ugly horse, but abstract textile designs, for example,\nmay be beautiful in themselves without a reference group or\n“concept,” and flowers please whether or not we connect\nthem to their practical purposes or functions in plant reproduction\n(Kant 1790, section 16). The idea in particular that free beauty is\ncompletely separated from practical use and that the experiencer of it\nis not concerned with the actual existence of the object leads Kant to\nconclude that absolute or free beauty is found in the form or\ndesign of the object, or as Clive Bell put it, in the\narrangement of lines and colors (in the case of painting) (Bell 1914).\nBy the time Bell writes in the early twentieth century, however,\nbeauty is out of fashion in the arts, and Bell frames his view not in\nterms of beauty but in terms of a general formalist conception of\naesthetic value. \nSince in reaching a genuine judgment of taste one is aware that one is\nnot responding to anything idiosyncratic in oneself, Kant asserts\n(1790, section 8), one will reach the conclusion that anyone similarly\nsituated should have the same experience: that is, one will presume\nthat there ought to be nothing to distinguish one person's judgment\nfrom another's (though in fact there may be). Built conceptually into\nthe judgment of taste is the assertion that anyone similarly situated\nought to have the same experience and reach the same judgment. Thus,\nbuilt into judgments of taste is a ‘universalization’\nsomewhat analogous to the universalization that Kant associates with\nethical judgments. In ethical judgments, however, the universalization\nis objective: if the judgment is true, then it is objectively the case\nthat everyone ought to act on the maxim according to which one acts.\nIn the case of aesthetic judgments, however, the judgment remains\nsubjective, but necessarily contains the ‘demand’ that\neveryone should reach the same judgment. The judgment conceptually\nentails a claim to inter-subjective validity. This accounts for the\nfact that we do very often argue about judgments of taste, and that we\nfind tastes that are different than our own defective. \nThe influence of this series of thoughts on philosophical aesthetics\nhas been immense. One might mention related approaches taken by such\nfigures as Schopenhauer, Hanslick, Bullough, and Croce, for example. A\nsomewhat similar though more adamantly subjectivist line is taken by\nSantayana, who defines beauty as ‘objectified pleasure.’\nThe judgment of something that it is beautiful responds to the fact\nthat it induces a certain sort of pleasure; but this pleasure is\nattributed to the object, as though the object itself were having\nsubjective states. \nWe have now reached our definition of beauty, which, in the terms of\nour successive analysis and narrowing of the conception, is value\npositive, intrinsic, and objectified. Or, in less technical language,\nBeauty is pleasure regarded as the quality of a thing. … Beauty\nis a value, that is, it is not a perception of a matter of fact or of\na relation: it is an emotion, an affection of our volitional and\nappreciative nature. An object cannot be beautiful if it can give\npleasure to nobody: a beauty to which all men were forever indifferent\nis a contradiction in terms. … Beauty is therefore a positive\nvalue that is intrinsic; it is a pleasure. (Santayana 1896,\n50–51) \nIt is much as though one were attributing malice to a balky object or\ndevice. The object causes certain frustrations and is then ascribed an\nagency or a kind of subjective agenda that would account for its\ncausing those effects. Now though Santayana thought the experience of\nbeauty could be profound or could even be the meaning of life, this\naccount appears to make beauty a sort of mistake: one attributes\nsubjective states (indeed, one's own) to a thing which in many\ninstances is not capable of having subjective states. \nIt is worth saying that Santayana's treatment of the topic in The\nSense of Beauty (1896) was the last major account offered in\nEnglish for some time, possibly because, once beauty has been admitted\nto be entirely subjective, much less when it is held to rest on a sort\nof mistake, there seems little more to be said. What stuck from Hume's\nand Kant's treatments was the subjectivity, not the heroic attempts to\ntemper it. If beauty is a subjective pleasure, it would seem to have\nno higher status than anything that entertains, amuses, or distracts;\nit seems odd or ridiculous to regard it as being comparable in\nimportance to truth or justice, for example. And the twentieth century\nalso abandoned beauty as the dominant goal of the arts, again possibly\nin part because its trivialization in theory led artists to believe\nthat they ought to pursue more real and more serious projects. This\ndecline is explored eloquently in Arthur Danto's book The Abuse of\nBeauty (2003). \nHowever, there has been a revival of interest in beauty in both art\nand philosophy in recent years, and several theorists have made new\nattempts to address the antinomy of taste. To some extent, such\napproaches echo G.E. Moore's: “To say that a thing is beautiful\nis to say, not indeed that it is itself good, but that it is a\nnecessary element in something which is: to prove that a thing is\ntruly beautiful is to prove that a whole, to which it bears a\nparticular relation as a part, is truly good” (Moore 1903, 201).\nOne interpretation of this would be that what is fundamentally\nvaluable is the situation in which the object and the person\nexperiencing are both embedded; the value of beauty might include both\nfeatures of the beautiful object and the pleasures of the\nexperiencer. \nSimilarly, Crispin Sartwell in his book Six Names of Beauty\n(2004), attributes beauty neither exclusively to the subject nor to\nthe object, but to the relation between them, and even more widely\nalso to the situation or environment in which they are both embedded.\nHe points out that when we attribute beauty to the night sky, for\ninstance, we do not take ourselves simply to be reporting a state of\npleasure in ourselves; we are turned outward toward it; we are\ncelebrating the real world. On the other hand, if there were no\nperceivers capable of experiencing such things, there would be no\nbeauty. Beauty, rather, emerges in situations in which subject and\nobject are juxtaposed and connected. \nAlexander Nehamas, in Only a Promise of Happiness (2007),\ncharacterizes beauty as an invitation to further experiences, a way\nthat things invite us in, while also possibly fending us off. The\nbeautiful object invites us to explore and interpret, but it also\nrequires us to explore and interpret: beauty is not to be regarded as\nan instantaneously apprehensible feature of surface. And Nehamas, like\nHume and Kant, though in another register, considers beauty to have an\nirreducibly social dimension. Beauty is something we share, or\nsomething we want to share, and shared experiences of beauty are\nparticularly intense forms of communication. Thus, the experience of\nbeauty is not primarily within the skull of the experiencer, but\nconnects observers and objects such as works of art and literature in\ncommunities of appreciation. \nAesthetic judgment, I believe, never commands universal agreement, and\nneither a beautiful object nor a work of art ever engages a catholic\ncommunity. Beauty creates smaller societies, no less important or\nserious because they are partial, and, from the point of view of its\nmembers, each one is orthodox—orthodox, however, without\nthinking of all others as heresies. … What is involved is less\na matter of understanding and more a matter of hope, of\nestablishing a community that centers around it—a\ncommunity, to be sure, whose boundaries are constantly shifting and\nwhose edges are never stable. (Nehamas 2007, 80–81) \nEach of the views sketched below has many expressions, some of which\nmay be incompatible with one another. In many or perhaps most of the\nactual formulations, elements of more than one such account are\npresent. For example, Kant's treatment of beauty in terms of\ndisinterested pleasure has obvious elements of hedonism, while the\necstatic neo-Platonism of Plotinus includes not only the unity of the\nobject, but also the fact that beauty calls out love or adoration.\nHowever, it is also worth remarking how divergent or even incompatible\nwith one another many of these views are: for example, some\nphilosophers associate beauty exclusively with use, others precisely\nwith uselessness. \nThe art historian Heinrich Wölfflin gives a fundamental\ndescription of the classical conception of beauty, as embodied in\nItalian Renaissance painting and architecture: \nThe central idea of the Italian Renaissance is that of perfect\nproportion. In the human figure as in the edifice, this epoch strove\nto achieve the image of perfection at rest within itself. Every form\ndeveloped to self-existent being, the whole freely co-ordinated:\nnothing but independently living parts…. In the system of a\nclassic composition, the single parts, however firmly they may be\nrooted in the whole, maintain a certain independence. It is not the\nanarchy of primitive art: the part is conditioned by the whole, and\nyet does not cease to have its own life. For the spectator, that\npresupposes an articulation, a progress from part to part, which is a\nvery different operation from perception as a whole. (Wölfflin\n1932, 9–10, 15) \nThe classical conception is that beauty consists of an arrangement of\nintegral parts into a coherent whole, according to proportion,\nharmony, symmetry, and similar notions. This is a primordial Western\nconception of beauty, and is embodied in classical and neo-classical\narchitecture, sculpture, literature, and music wherever they appear.\nAristotle says in the Poetics that “to be beautiful, a\nliving creature, and every whole made up of parts, must …\npresent a certain order in its arrangement of parts” (Aristotle,\nvolume 2, 2322 [1450b34]). And in the Metaphysics: “The\nchief forms of beauty are order and symmetry and definiteness, which\nthe mathematical sciences demonstrate in a special degree”\n(Aristotle, volume 2 1705 [1078a36]). This view, as Aristotle implies,\nis sometimes boiled down to a mathematical formula, such as the golden\nsection, but it need not be thought of in such strict terms. The\nconception is exemplified above all in such texts as Euclid's\nElements and such works of architecture as the Parthenon,\nand, again, by the Canon of the sculptor Polykleitos (late\nfifth/early fourth century BCE). \nThe Canon was not only a statue deigned to display perfect\nproportion, but a now-lost treatise on beauty. The physician Galen\ncharacterizes the text as specifying, for example, the proportions of\n“the finger to the finger, and of all the fingers to the\nmetacarpus, and the wrist, and of all these to the forearm, and of the\nforearm to the arm, in fact of everything to everything…. For\nhaving taught us in that treatise all the symmetriae of the\nbody, Polyclitus supported his treatise with a work, having made the\nstatue of a man according to his treatise, and having called the\nstatue itself, like the treatise, the Canon” (quoted in\nPollitt 1974, 15). It is important to note that the concept of\n‘symmetry’ in classical texts is distinct from and richer\nthan its current use to indicate bilateral mirroring. It also refers\nprecisely to the sorts of harmonious and measurable proportions among\nthe parts characteristic of objects that are beautiful in the\nclassical sense, which carried also a moral weight. For example, in\nthe Sophist (228c-e), Plato describes virtuous souls as\nsymmetrical. \nThe ancient Roman architect Vitruvius gives as good a characterization\nof the classical conception as any, both in its complexities and,\nappropriately enough, in its underlying unity: \nArchitecture consists of Order, which in Greek is called\ntaxis, and arrangement, which the Greeks name\ndiathesis, and of Proportion and Symmetry and Decor and\nDistribution which in the Greeks is called oeconomia. \nOrder is the balanced adjustment of the details of the work\nseparately, and as to the whole, the arrangement of the proportion\nwith a view to a symmetrical result. \nProportion implies a graceful semblance: the suitable display of\ndetails in their context. This is attained when the details of the\nwork are of a height suitable to their breadth, of a breadth suitable\nto their length; in a word, when everything has a symmetrical\ncorrespondence. \nSymmetry also is the appropriate harmony arising out of the details of\nthe work itself: the correspondence of each given detail to the form\nof the design as a whole. As in the human body, from cubit, foot,\npalm, inch and other small parts come the symmetric quality of\neurhythmy. (Vitruvius, 26–27) \nAquinas, in a typically Aristotelian pluralist formulation, says that\n“There are three requirements for beauty. Firstly, integrity or\nperfection—for if something is impaired it is ugly. Then there\nis due proportion or consonance. And also clarity: whence things that\nare brightly coloured are called beautiful” (Summa Theologica I,\n39, 8). \nFrancis Hutcheson in the eighteenth century gives what may well be the\nclearest expression of the view: “What we call Beautiful in\nObjects, to speak in the Mathematical Style, seems to be in a compound\nRatio of Uniformity and Variety; so that where the Uniformity of Bodys\nis equal, the Beauty is as the Variety; and where the Variety is\nequal, the Beauty is as the Uniformity” (Hutcheson 1725, 29).\nIndeed, proponents of the view often speak “in the Mathematical\nStyle.” Hutcheson goes on to adduce mathematical formulae, and\nspecifically the propositions of Euclid, as the most beautiful objects\n(in another echo of Aristotle), though he also rapturously praises\nnature, with its massive complexity underlain by universal physical\nlaws as revealed, for example, by Newton. There is beauty, he says,\n“In the Knowledge of some great Principles, or universal Forces,\nfrom which innumerable Effects do flow. Such is Gravitation, in Sir\nIsaac Newton's Scheme” (Hutcheson 1725, 38). \nA very compelling series of refutations of and counter-examples to the\nidea that beauty can be a matter of any specific proportions between\nparts, and hence to the classical conception, is given by Edmund Burke\nin A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the\nBeautiful and the Sublime: \nTurning our eyes to the vegetable kingdom, we find nothing there so\nbeautiful as flowers; but flowers are of every sort of shape, and\nevery sort of disposition; they are turned and fashioned into an\ninfinite variety of forms. … The rose is a large flower, yet it\ngrows upon a small shrub; the flower of the apple is very small, and\nit grows upon a large tree; yet the rose and the apple blossom are\nboth beautiful. … The swan, confessedly a beautiful bird, has a\nneck longer than the rest of its body, and but a very short tail; is\nthis a beautiful proportion? we must allow that it is. But what shall\nwe say of the peacock, who has comparatively but a short neck, with a\ntail longer than the neck and the rest of the body taken together?\n… There are some parts of the human body, that are observed to\nhold certain proportions to each other; but before it can be proved,\nthat the efficient cause of beauty lies in these, it must be shewn,\nthat wherever these are found exact, the person to whom they belong is\nbeautiful. … For my part, I have at several times very\ncarefully examined many of these proportions, and found them to hold\nvery nearly, or altogether alike in many subjects, which were not only\nvery different from one another, but where one has been very\nbeautiful, and the other very remote from beauty. … You may\nassign any proportions you please to every part of the of the human\nbody; and I undertake, that a painter shall observe them all, and\nnotwithstanding produce, if he pleases, a very ugly figure. (Burke\n1757, 84–89) \nThere are many ways to interpret Plato's relation to classical\naesthetics. The political system sketched in The Republic\ncharacterizes justice in terms of the relation of part and whole. But\nPlato was also no doubt a dissident in classical culture, and the\naccount of beauty that is expressed specifically in The\nSymposium—perhaps the key Socratic text for neo-Platonism\nand for the idealist conception of beauty—expresses an\naspiration toward beauty as perfect unity. \nIn the midst of a drinking party, Socrates recounts the teachings of\nhis instructress, one Diotima, on matters of love. She connects the\nexperience of beauty to the erotic or the desire to reproduce (Plato,\n558–59 [Symposium 206c–207e]). But the desire to reproduce\nis associated in turn with a desire for the immortal or eternal:\n‘And why all this longing for propagation? Because this is the\none deathless and eternal element in our mortality. And since we have\nagreed that the lover longs for the good to be his own forever, it\nfollows that we are bound to long for immortality as well as for the\ngood—which is to say that Love is a longing for\nimmortality” (Plato, 559, [Symposium 206e–207a]). What\nfollows is, if not classical, at any rate classic: \nThe candidate for this initiation cannot, if his efforts are to be\nrewarded, begin too early to devote himself to the beauties of the\nbody. First of all, if his preceptor instructs him as he should, he\nwill fall in love with the beauty of one individual body, so that his\npassion may give life to noble discourse. Next he must consider how\nnearly related the beauty of any one body is to the beauty of any\nother, and he will see that if he is to devote himself to loveliness\nof form it will be absurd to deny that the beauty of each and every\nbody is the same. Having reached this point, he must set himself to be\nthe lover of every lovely body, and bring his passion for the one into\ndue proportion by deeming it of little or no importance. \nNext he must grasp that the beauties of the body are as nothing to the\nbeauties of the soul, so that wherever he meets with spiritual\nloveliness, even in the husk of an unlovely body, he will find it\nbeautiful enough to fall in love with and cherish—and beautiful\nenough to quicken in his heart a longing for such discourse as tends\ntoward the building of a noble nature. And from this he will be led to\ncontemplate the beauty of laws and institutions. And when he discovers\nhow every kind of beauty is akin to every other he will conclude that\nthe beauty of the body is not, after all, of so great moment.\n… \nAnd so, when his prescribed devotion to boyish beauties has carried\nour candidate so far that the universal beauty dawns upon his inward\nsight, he is almost within reach of the final revelation. …\nStarting from individual beauties, the quest for universal beauty must\nfind him mounting the heavenly ladder, stepping from rung to\nrung—that is, from one to two, and from two to every\nlovely body, and from bodily beauty to the beauty of institutions,\nfrom institutions to learning, and from learning in general to the\nspecial lore that pertains to nothing but the beautiful\nitself—until at last he comes to know what beauty is. \nAnd if, my dear Socrates, Diotima went on, man's life is ever worth\nliving, it is when he has attained this vision of the very soul of\nbeauty. (Plato, 561–63 [Symposium 210a–211d]) \nBeauty here is conceived—perhaps explicitly in contrast to the\nclassical aesthetics of integral parts and coherent whole—as\nperfect unity, or indeed as the principle of unity itself. \nPlotinus, as we have already seen, comes close to equating beauty with\nformedness per se: it is the source of unity among disparate things,\nand it is itself perfect unity. Plotinus specifically attacks what we\nhave called the classical conception of beauty: \nAlmost everyone declares that the symmetry of parts towards each other\nand towards a whole, with, besides, a certain charm of colour,\nconstitutes the beauty recognized by the eye, that in visible things,\nas indeed in all else, universally, the beautiful thing is essentially\nsymmetrical, patterned. \nBut think what this means. \nOnly a compound can be beautiful, never anything devoid of parts; and\nonly a whole; the several parts will have beauty, not in themselves,\nbut only as working together to give a comely total. Yet beauty in an\naggregate demands beauty in details; it cannot be constructed out of\nugliness; its law must run throughout. \nAll the loveliness of colour and even the light of the sun, being\ndevoid of parts and so not beautiful by symmetry, must be ruled out of\nthe realm of beauty. And how comes gold to be a beautiful thing? And\nlightning by night, and the stars, why are these so fair? \nIn sounds also the simple must be proscribed, though often in a whole\nnoble composition each several tone is delicious in itself. (Plotinus,\n21 [Ennead 1.6]) \nAnd Plotinus declares that fire is the most beautiful physical thing,\n“making ever upwards, the subtlest and sprightliest of all\nbodies, as very near to the unembodied. … Hence the splendour\nof its light, the splendour that belongs to the Idea” (Plotinus,\n22 [Ennead 1.3]). For Plotinus as for Plato, all multiplicity must be\nimmolated finally into unity, and all roads of inquiry and experience\nlead toward the Good/Beautiful/True/Divine. \nThis gave rise to a basically mystical vision of the beauty of God\nthat, as Umberto Eco has argued, persisted alongside an anti-aesthetic\nasceticism throughout the Middle Ages: a delight in profusion that\nfinally merges into a single spiritual unity. In the sixth century,\nPseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite characterized the whole of creation as\nyearning toward God; the universe is called into being by love of God\nas beauty (Pseudo-Dionysius, 4.7; see Kirwan 1999, 29).\nSensual/aesthetic pleasures could be considered the expressions of the\nimmense, beautiful profusion of God and our ravishment thereby. Eco\nquotes Suger, Abbot of St Denis in the twelfth century, describing a\nrichly-appointed church: \nThus, when—out of my delight in the beauty of the house of\nGod—the loveliness of the many-colored gems has called me away\nfrom external cares, and worthy meditation has induced me to reflect,\ntransferring that which is material to that which is immaterial, on\nthe diversity of the sacred virtues: then it seems to me that I see\nmyself dwelling, as it were, in some strange region of the universe\nwhich neither exists entirely in the slime of the earth nor entirely\nin the purity of Heaven; and that, by the grace of God, I can be\ntransported from this inferior to that higher world in an anagogical\nmanner. (Eco 1959, 14) \nThis conception has had many expressions in the modern era, including\nin such figures as Shaftesbury, Schiller, and Hegel, according to whom\nthe aesthetic or the experience of art and beauty is a primary bridge\n(or to use the Platonic image, stairway or ladder) between the\nmaterial and the spiritual. For Shaftesbury, there are three levels of\nbeauty: what God makes (nature); what human beings make from nature or\nwhat is transformed by human intelligence (art, for example); and\nfinally what makes even the maker of such things as us (that is, God).\nShaftesbury's character Theocles describes “the third order of\nbeauty,” \nwhich forms not only such as we call mere forms but even the forms\nwhich form. For we ourselves are notable architects in matter, and can\nshow lifeless bodies brought into form, and fashioned by our own\nhands, but that which fashions even minds themselves, contains in\nitself all the beauties fashioned by those minds, and is consequently\nthe principle, source, and fountain of all beauty. … Whatever\nappears in our second order of forms, or whatever is derived or\nproduced from thence, all this is eminently, principally, and\noriginally in this last order of supreme and sovereign beauty.\n… Thus architecture, music, and all which is of human\ninvention, resolves itself into this last order. (Shaftesbury 1738,\n228–29) \nSchiller's expression of a similar series of thoughts was\nfundamentally influential on the conceptions of beauty developed\nwithin German Idealism: \nThe pre-rational concept of Beauty, if such a thing be adduced, can be\ndrawn from no actual case—rather does itself correct and guide\nour judgement concerning every actual case; it must therefore be\nsought along the path of abstraction, and it can be inferred simply\nfrom the possibility of a nature that is both sensuous and rational;\nin a word, Beauty must be exhibited as a necessary condition of\nhumanity. Beauty … makes of man a whole, complete in himself.\n(1795, 59–60, 86) \nFor Schiller, beauty or play or art (he uses the words, rather\ncavalierly, almost interchangeably) performs the process of\nintegrating or rendering compatible the natural and the spiritual, or\nthe sensuous and the rational: only in such a state of integration are\nwe—who exist simultaneously on both these levels—free.\nThis is quite similar to Plato's ‘ladder’: beauty as a way\nto ascend to the abstract or spiritual. But Schiller—though this\nis at times unclear—is more concerned with integrating the\nrealms of nature and spirit than with transcending the level of\nphysical reality entirely, a la Plato. It is beauty and art that\nperforms this integration. \nIn this and in other ways—including the tripartite dialectical\nstructure of the view—Schiller strikingly anticipates Hegel, who\nwrites as follows. \nThe philosophical Concept of the beautiful, to indicate its true\nnature at least in a preliminary way, must contain, reconciled within\nitself, both the extremes which have been mentioned [the ideal and the\nempirical] because it unites metaphysical universality with real\nparticularity. (Hegel 1835, 22) \nBeauty, we might say, or artistic beauty at any rate, is a route from\nthe sensuous and particular to the Absolute and to freedom, from\nfinitude to the infinite, formulations that—while they are\ninfluenced by Schiller—strikingly recall Shaftesbury, Plotinus,\nand Plato. \nBoth Hegel and Shaftesbury, who associate beauty and art with mind and\nspirit, hold that the beauty of art is higher than the beauty of\nnature, on the grounds that, as Hegel puts it, “the beauty of\nart is born of the spirit and born again” (Hegel 1835,\n2). That is, the natural world is born of God, but the beauty of art\ntransforms that material again by the spirit of the artist. This idea\nreaches is apogee in Benedetto Croce, who very nearly denies that\nnature can ever be beautiful, or at any rate asserts that the beauty\nof nature is a reflection of the beauty of art. “The real\nmeaning of ‘natural beauty’ is that certain persons,\nthings, places are, by the effect which they exert upon one,\ncomparable with poetry, painting, sculpture, and the other arts”\n(Croce 1928, 230). \nEdmund Burke, expressing an ancient tradition, writes that, “by\nbeauty I mean, that quality or those qualities in bodies, by which\nthey cause love, or some passion similar to it” (Burke 1757,\n83). As we have seen, in almost all treatments of beauty, even the\nmost apparently object or objectively-oriented, there is a moment in\nwhich the subjective qualities of the experience of beauty are\nemphasized: rhapsodically, perhaps, or in terms of pleasure or\nataraxia, as in Schopenhauer. For example, we have already\nseen Plotinus, for whom beauty is certainly not subjective, describe\nthe experience of beauty ecstatically. In the idealist tradition, the\nhuman soul, as it were, recognizes in beauty its true origin and\ndestiny. Among the Greeks, the connection of beauty with love is\nproverbial from early myth, and Aphrodite the goddess of love won the\nJudgment of Paris by promising Paris the most beautiful woman in the\nworld. \nThere is an historical connection between idealist accounts of beauty\nand those that connect it to love and longing, though there would seem\nto be no entailment either way. We have Sappho's famous fragment 16:\n“Some say thronging cavalry, some say foot soldiers, others call\na fleet the most beautiful sights the dark world offers, but I say\nit's whatever you love best” (Sappho, 16). (Indeed, at\nPhaedrus 236c, Socrates appears to defer to “the fair\nSappho” as having had greater insight than himself on love\n[Plato, 483].) \nPlato's discussions of beauty in the Symposium and the\nPhaedrus occur in the context of the theme of erotic love. In\nthe former, love is portrayed as the ‘child’ of poverty\nand plenty. “Nor is he delicate and lovely as most of us\nbelieve, but harsh and arid, barefoot and homeless” (Plato, 556\n[Symposium 203b–d]). Love is portrayed as a lack or absence that\nseeks its own fulfillment in beauty: a picture of mortality as an\ninfinite longing. Love is always in a state of lack and hence of\ndesire: the desire to possess the beautiful. Then if this state of\ninfinite longing could be trained on the truth, we would have a path\nto wisdom. The basic idea has been recovered many times, for example\nby the Romantics. It fueled the cult of idealized or courtly love\nthrough the Middle Ages, in which the beloved became a symbol of the\ninfinite. \nRecent work on the theory of beauty has revived this idea, and turning\naway from pleasure has turned toward love or longing (which are not\nnecessarily entirely pleasurable experiences) as the experiential\ncorrelate of beauty. Both Sartwell and Nehamas use Sappho's fragment\n16 as an epigraph. Sartwell defines beauty as “the object of\nlonging” and characterizes longing as intense and unfulfilled\ndesire. He calls it a fundamental condition of a finite being in time,\nwhere we are always in the process of losing whatever we have, and are\nthus irremediably in a state of longing. And Nehamas writes \nI think of beauty as the emblem of what we lack, the mark of an art\nthat speaks to our desire. … Beautiful things don't stand\naloof, but direct our attention and our desire to everything else we\nmust learn or acquire in order to understand and possess, and they\nquicken the sense of life, giving it new shape and direction. (Nehamas\n2007, 77) \nThinkers of the 18th century—many of them oriented\ntoward empiricism—accounted for beauty in terms of pleasure. The\nItalian historian Ludovico Antonio Muratori, for example, in quite a\ntypical formulation, says that “By beautiful we\ngenerally understand whatever, when seen, heard, or understood,\ndelights, pleases, and ravishes us by causing within us agreeable\nsensations” (see Carritt 1931, 60). In Hutcheson it is not clear\nwhether we ought to conceive beauty primarily in terms of classical\nformal elements or in terms of the viewer's pleasurable response. He\nbegins the Inquiry Into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and\nVirtue with a discussion of pleasure. And he appears to assert\nthat objects which instantiate his “compound ratio of uniformity\nand variety’ are peculiarly or necessarily capable of producing\npleasure: \nThe only Pleasure of sense, which our Philosophers seem to consider,\nis that which accompanys the simple Ideas of Sensation; But there are\nvastly greater Pleasures in those complex Ideas of objects, which\nobtain the Names of Beautiful, Regular, Harmonious. Thus every one\nacknowledges he is more delighted with a fine Face, a just Picture,\nthan with the View of any one Colour, were it as strong and lively as\npossible; and more pleased with a Prospect of the Sun arising among\nsettled Clouds, and colouring their Edges, with a starry Hemisphere, a\nfine Landskip, a regular Building, than with a clear blue Sky, a\nsmooth Sea, or a large open Plain, not diversify'd by Woods, Hills,\nWaters, Buildings: And yet even these latter Appearances are not quite\nsimple. So in Musick, the Pleasure of fine Composition is incomparably\ngreater than that of any one Note, how sweet, full, or swelling\nsoever. (Hutcheson 1725, 22) \nWhen Hutcheson then goes on to describe ‘original or absolute\nbeauty,’ he does it, as we have seen, in terms of the qualities\nof the beautiful thing, and yet throughout, he insists that beauty is\ncentered in the human experience of pleasure. But of course the idea\nof pleasure could come apart from Hutcheson's particular aesthetic\npreferences, which are poised precisely opposite Plotinus's, for\nexample. That we find pleasure in a symmetrical rather than an\nasymmetrical building (if we do) is contingent. But that beauty is\nconnected to pleasure appears, according to Hutcheson, to be\nnecessary, and the pleasure which is the locus of beauty itself has\nideas rather than things as its object. \nHume writes in a similar vein in the Treatise of Human\nNature: \nBeauty is such an order and construction of parts as, either by the\nprimary constitution of our nature, by custom, or by caprice, is\nfitted to give a pleasure and satisfaction to the soul. …\nPleasure and pain, therefore, are not only necessary attendants of\nbeauty and deformity, but constitute their very essence. (Hume 1740,\n299) \nThough this appears ambiguous as between locating the beauty in the\npleasure or in the impression or idea that causes it, Hume is soon\ntalking about the ‘sentiment of beauty,’ where sentiment\nis, roughly, a pleasurable or painful response to impressions or\nideas, though beauty is a matter of cultivated or delicate pleasures.\nIndeed, by the time of Kant's Third Critique and after that for\nperhaps two centuries, the direct connection of beauty to pleasure is\ntaken as a commonplace, to the point where thinkers are frequently\nidentifying beauty as a certain sort of pleasure. Santayana, for\nexample, as we have seen, while still gesturing in the direction of\nthe object or experience that causes pleasure, emphatically identifies\nbeauty as a certain sort of pleasure. \nOne result of this approach to beauty—or perhaps an extreme\nexpression of this orientation—is the assertion of the\npositivists that words such as ‘beauty’ are meaningless or\nwithout cognitive content, or are mere expressions of subjective\napproval. Hume and Kant were no sooner declaring beauty to be a matter\nof sentiment or pleasure and therefore to be subjective than they were\ntrying to ameliorate the sting, largely by emphasizing critical\nconsensus. But once this fundamental admission is made, any consensus\nis contingent. Another way to formulate this is that it appears to\ncertain thinkers after Hume and Kant that there can be no\nreasons to prefer the consensus to a counter-consensus\nassessment. A.J. Ayer writes: \nSuch aesthetic words as ‘beautiful’ and\n‘hideous’ are employed … not to make statements of\nfact, but simply to express certain feelings and evoke a certain\nresponse. It follows…that there is no sense attributing\nobjective validity to aesthetic judgments, and no possibility of\narguing about questions of value in aesthetics. (Ayer 1952, 113) \nAll meaningful claims either concern the meaning of terms or are\nempirical, in which case they are meaningful because observations\ncould confirm or disconfirm them. ‘That song is beautiful’\nhas neither status, and hence has no empirical or conceptual content.\nIt merely expresses a positive attitude of a particular viewer; it is\nan expression of pleasure, like a satisfied sigh. The question of\nbeauty is not a genuine question, and we can safely leave it behind or\nalone. Most twentieth-century philosophers did just that. \nPhilosophers in the Kantian tradition identify the experience of\nbeauty with disinterested pleasure, psychical distance, and the like,\nand contrast the aesthetic with the practical. “Taste\nis the faculty of judging an object or mode of representing it by an\nentirely disinterested satisfaction or dissatisfaction. The\nobject of such satisfaction is called beautiful” (Kant\n1790, 45). Edward Bullough distinguishes the beautiful from the merely\nagreeable on the grounds that the former requires a distance from\npractical concerns: “Distance is produced in the first instance\nby putting the phenomenon, so to speak, out of gear with our\npractical, actual self; by allowing it to stand outside the context of\nour personal needs and ends.“ (Bullough 1912, 244) \nOn the other hand, many philosophers have gone in the opposite\ndirection and have identified beauty with suitedness to use.\n‘Beauty’ is perhaps one of the few terms that could\nplausibly sustain such entirely opposed interpretations. \nAccording to Diogenes Laertius, the ancient hedonist Aristippus of\nCyrene took a rather direct approach. \nIs not then, also, a beautiful woman useful in proportion as she is\nbeautiful; and a boy and a youth useful in proportion to their beauty?\nWell then, a handsome boy and a handsome youth must be useful exactly\nin proportion as they are handsome. Now the use of beauty is, to be\nembraced. If then a man embraces a woman just as it is useful that he\nshould, he does not do wrong; nor, again, will he be doing wrong in\nemploying beauty for the purposes for which it is useful. (Diogenes\nLaertius, 94) \nIn some ways, Aristippus is portrayed parodically: as the very worst\nof the sophists, though supposedly a follower of Socrates. And yet the\nidea of beauty as suitedness to use finds expression in a number of\nthinkers. Xenophon's Memorabilia puts the view in the mouth\nof Socrates, with Aristippus as interlocutor: \nSocrates: In short everything which we use is considered both\ngood and beautiful from the same point of view, namely its use. \nAristippus: Why then, is a dung-basket a beautiful thing? \nSocrates: Of course it is, and a golden shield is ugly, if\nthe one be beautifully fitted to its purpose and the other ill.\n(Xenophon, Book III, viii) \nBerkeley expresses a similar view in his dialogue Alciphron,\nthough he begins with the hedonist conception: “Every one knows\nthat beauty is what pleases” (Berkeley 1732, 174, see Carritt\n1931, 75). But it pleases for reasons of usefulness. Thus, as Xenophon\nsuggests, on this view, things are beautiful only in relation to the\nuses for which they are intended or to which they are properly\napplied. The proper proportions of an object depend on what kind of\nobject it is, and again a beautiful ox would make an ugly horse.\n“The parts, therefore, in true proportions, must be so related,\nand adjusted to one another, as they may best conspire to the use and\noperation of the whole” (Berkeley 1732, 174–75, see\nCarritt 1931, 76). One result of this is that, though beauty remains\ntied to pleasure, it is not an immediate sensible experience. It\nessentially requires intellection and practical activity: one has to\nknow the use of a thing, and assess its suitedness to that use. \nThis treatment of beauty is often used, for example, to criticize the\ndistinction between fine art and craft, and it avoids sheer\nphilistinism by enriching the concept of ‘use,’ so that it\nmight encompass not only performing a practical task, but performing\nit especially well or with an especial satisfaction. Ananda\nCoomaraswamy, the Ceylonese-British scholar of Indian and European\nmedieval arts, adds that a beautiful work of art or craft expresses as\nwell as serves its purpose. \nA cathedral is not as such more beautiful than an airplane, … a\nhymn than a mathematical equation. … A well-made sword is not\nmore beautiful than a well-made scalpel, though one is used to slay,\nthe other to heal. Works of art are only good or bad, beautiful or\nugly in themselves, to the extent that they are or are not well and\ntruly made, that is, do or do not express, or do or do not serve their\npurpose. (Coomaraswamy 1977, 75) \nRoger Scruton, in his book Beauty (2009) returns to a\nmodified Kantianism with regard to both beauty and sublimity, enriched\nby many and varied examples. \"We call something beautiful,\" writes\nScruton, \"when we gain pleasure from contemplating it as an individual\nobject, for its own sake, and in its presented form.\"\n(Scruton 2009, 26) \nDespite the Kantian framework, Scruton, like Sartwell and Nehamas,\nthrows the subjective/objective distinction into question. He compares\nexperiencing a beautiful thing to a kiss. To kiss someone that one\nloves is not merely to place one body part on another, \"but to touch\nthe other person in his very self. Hence the kiss is compromising - it\nis a move from one self toward another, and a summoning of\nthe other into the surface of his being.\" (Scruton 2009, 48)","contact.mail":"crispinsartwell@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
