Panentheism\nconsiders God and the world to be inter-related with the world being\nin God and God being in the world. It offers an increasingly popular\nalternative to both classical theism and pantheism. Classical theistic\nsystems often prioritize the difference between God and the world\nwhile panentheism stresses God’s active presence in the world\nand the world’s influence upon God. While pantheism emphasizes\nGod’s presence in the world, panentheism maintains the identity\nand significance of the non-divine. Anticipations of panentheistic\nunderstandings of God have occurred in both philosophical and\ntheological writings throughout history (Hartshorne and Reese 1953;\nJ. Cooper, 2006). However, a rich diversity of panentheistic\nunderstandings has developed in the past two centuries primarily in\nChristian traditions responding to scientific thought (Clayton and\nPeacocke 2004a). Although panentheism generally emphasizes God’s\npresence in the world without losing the distinct identity of either\nGod or the world, specific forms of panentheism, drawing from\ndifferent sources, explain the nature of the relationship of God to\nthe world in a variety of ways and come to different conclusions about\nthe nature of the significance of the world for the identity of\nGod. Panentheists have responded to two primary criticisms: (1) the\npanentheistic God is a limited God, and (2) panentheism cannot be\ndistinguished from other forms of theism such as classical theism or\npantheism.\n\n\nBecause modern “panentheism” developed under the influence\nof German Idealism, Whiteheadian process philosophy, and current\nscientific thought, panentheists employ a variety of terms with\nmeanings that have specialized content. \nTheological terms as understood by panentheists: \nTerms influenced by the German Idealism of Hegel and Schelling: \nTerms influenced by Whiteheadian process philosophy: \nTerms related to current scientific thought: \nAlthough numerous meanings have been attributed to the\n“in” in panentheism (Clayton 2004, 253), the more\nsignificant meanings are: \nAlthough Karl Krause (1781–1832) appears to be the first to use\nthe explicit label of “panentheism” (Gregersen 2004, 28),\nSchelling used the phrase “Pan+en+theism” in his Essay\non Freedom in 1809 before Krause used “panentheism” in\n1829 (Clayton 2010, 183). However, various advocates and critics of\npanentheism find evidence of incipient or implicit forms of\npanentheism present in religious thought as early as 1300 BCE.\nHartshorne discovers the first indication of panentheistic themes in\nIkhnaton (1375–1358 BCE), the Egyptian pharaoh often considered\nthe first monotheist. In his poetic description of the sun god,\nIkhnaton avoids both the separation of God from the world that will\ncharacterize theism and the identification of God with the\nworld that will characterize pantheism (Hartshorne 1953, 29–30).\nEarly Vedantic thought implies panentheism in non-Advaita forms that\nunderstand non-dualism as inclusive of differences. Although there are\ntexts referring to Brahman as contracted and identical to Brahman,\nother texts speak of Brahman as expanded. In these texts, the perfect\nincludes and surpasses the total of imperfect things as an\nappropriation of the imperfect. Although not the dominant\ninterpretation of the Upanishads, multiple intimations of\npanentheism are present in the Upanishads (Whittemore 1988,\n33, 41–44). Hartshorne finds additional religious concepts of\nGod that hold the unchanging and the changing together in a way that\nallows for the development and significance of the non-divine in\nLao-Tse (fourth century BCE) and in the Judeo-Christian scriptures\n(1953, 32–38). \nIn philosophical reflection, Plato (427/428–348/347 BCE) plays a\nrole in the development of implicit panentheism although there is\ndisagreement about the nature of that role. Hartshorne drew a dipolar\nunderstanding of God that includes both immutability and mutability\nfrom Plato. Hartshorne understood Plato’s concept of the divine\nto include the Forms as pure and unchanging being and the World soul\nas changing and in motion. Although he concluded that Plato never\nreconciled these two elements in his understanding of the divine, both\naspects were present (1953, 54). J. Cooper, instead, maintains that\nPlato retained an essential distinction between the Good and the other\nbeings that Plato called gods. According to J. Cooper, Plotinus\n(204–270 CE) rather than Plato provided the basis for\npanentheism with his description of the physical world as an emanation\nof being from the One making the world part of the Ultimate (2006,\n35–39). However, Baltzly finds evidence in the Timaeus\nof a polytheistic view that can be identified as panentheistic\n(2010). \nFrom Plato to Schelling (1775–1854 CE), various theologians and\nphilosophers developed ideas that are similar to themes in\ncontemporary panentheism. These ideas developed as expressions of\ntheism. Proclus (412–485 CE) and Pseudo-Dionysus (late Fifth to\nearly Sixth century) drawing upon Plotinus developed perspectives in\nwhich the world came from God and understood the relationship between\nGod and the world as a dialectical relationship in which the world\ncame from God and returned to God. (J. Cooper 2006, 42–46). In\nthe Middle Ages, the influence of Neoplatonism continued in the\nthought of Eriugena (815–877 CE), Eckhart (1260–1328 CE),\nNicholas of Cusa (1401–1464 CE), and Boehme (1575–1624\nCE). Although accused of pantheism by their contemporaries, their\nsystems can be identified as panentheistic because they understood God\nin various ways as including the world rather than being the world and\nbecause they used a dialectical method. The dialectical method\ninvolved the generation of opposites and then the reconciliation of\nthe opposition in God. This retained the distinct identity of God in\nGod’s influence of the world (J.  Cooper 2006,\n47–62). During the early modern period, Bruno (1548–1600\nCE) and Spinoza (1631–1677 CE) responded to the dualism of\nclassical theism by emphasizing the relationship between God and the\nworld to the point that the nature of any ontological distinction\nbetween God and the world became problematic. Later thinkers such as\nthe Cambridge Platonists (Seventeenth century), Jonathan Edwards\n(1703–1758 CE) (Crisp 2009), and Friedrich Schleiermacher\n(1768–1834 CE) thought of the world as in some way in God or a\ndevelopment from God. Although they did not stress the ontological\ndistinction between God and the world, they did emphasize the\nresponsive relationship that humans have to God. Human responsiveness\nassumed some degree of human initiative if not freedom, which\nindicates some distinction between God and humans. The assumption of\nsome degree of human initiative was a reaction against the loss of\nfreedom due to Spinoza’s close identification between God and\nthe world (J. Cooper 2006, 64–90). \nThe nineteenth and twentieth centuries saw the development of\npanentheism as a specific position regarding God’s relationship\nto the world. The awareness of panentheism as an alternative to\nclassical theism and pantheism developed out of a complex of\napproaches. Philosophical idealism and philosophical adaptation of the\nscientific concept of evolution provided the basic sources of the\nexplicit position of panentheism. Philosophical approaches applying\nthe concept of development to God reached their most complete\nexpression in process philosophy’s understanding of God being\naffected by the events of the world. \nHegel (1770–1831) and Schelling (1775–1854) sought to\nretain the close relationship between God and the world that Spinoza\nproposed without identifying God with the world. Their concept of God\nas developing in and through the world provided the means for\naccomplishing this. Prior to this time, God had been understood as\nunchanging and the world as changing while existing in God (J. Cooper\n2006, 90). Schelling’s understanding of God as personal provided\nthe basis for the unity of the diversity in the world in a manner that\nwas more open than Hegel’s understanding. Schelling emphasized\nthe freedom of the creatures in relation to the necessity of\nGod’s nature as love. For Schelling, God’s free unfolding\nof God’s internal subjective necessity did not result in an\nexternal empirical necessity determining the world (Clayton 2000,\n474). This relationship resulted in vitality and on-going development.\nHartshorne classified this as a dipolar understanding of God in that\nGod is both necessary and developing (1953, 234). J. Cooper describes\nSchelling’s thought as dynamic cooperative panentheism (2006,\n95). Hegel found Schelling inadequate and sought a greater unity for\nthe diversity. He united Fichte’s subjective idealism and\nSchelling’s objective idealism to provide a metaphysics of\nsubjectivity rather than substance (Clayton 2008a, 125). Hegel’s\nunification of Fichte and Schelling resulted in a more comprehensive\nand consistent system still based upon change in God. God as well as\nnature is characterized by dialectical development. In his rejection\nof pantheism, Hegel understood the infinite as including the finite by\nabsorbing the finite into its own fuller nature. This retained divine\ntranscendence in the sense of the divine surpassing its parts although\nnot separate from the parts (Whittemore 1960, 141–142). The\ndivine transcendence provided unity through the development of the\nAbsolute through history. Karl Krause (1781–1832) in 1828\nlabeled Schelling’s and Hegel’s positions as\n“panentheism” in order to emphasize their differences from\nSpinoza’s identification of God with the world (Altmanspacher and von Sas 2017, 1032).\nJ. Cooper describes Hegel’s panentheism as dialectical\nhistorical panentheism (2006, 107). \nAs Darwin’s theory of evolution introduced history into the\nconceptualization of biology, Samuel Alexander (1859–1938),\nHenri Bergson (1859–1941), and C. Lloyd Morgan (1852–1936)\nintroduced development into the ways in which all of physical reality\nwas conceptualized. They then worked out positions that in a variety\nof ways understood God and the world as growing in relationship to\neach other. Although Hartshorne’s classification of\n“panentheism” did not include Alexander in the category of\n“panentheism,” only occasionally mentioned Bergson, and\nmade no reference to Morgan, Whitehead referred to all three of these\nthinkers positively. It may be too strong to claim that they\ninfluenced Whitehead (Emmett 1992), but they did provide the background\nfor Whitehead’s and then Hartshorne’s systematic\ndevelopment of process philosophy as an expression of panentheism.\nHartshorne popularized the modern use of the term\n“panentheism” and considered Whitehead to be the\noutstanding panentheist (Hartshorne 1953, 273). Although Hartshorne\nmade several modifications to Whitehead’s understanding of God,\nthe basic structures of Whitehead’s thought were continued in\nHartshorne’s further development of Whitehead’s philosophy\n(Ford 1973, Cobb 1965). God, for process philosophy, is necessary for\nany actual world. Without God, the world would be nothing more than an\nunchanging existence radically different from the actual world of\nexperience. God as both eternal and temporal provides possibilities\nthat call the world to change and develop. God as eternal provides an\nactual source of those possibilities. However, if God is only eternal,\nthe possibilities would be unrelated to the actual world as it\npresently exists. Thus, Whitehead and Hartshorne understand the world\nto be present in God in order for the possibilities that lead to\ndevelopment to be related to the world (Hartshorne 1953, 273). The\nimplication of God’s inclusion of the world is that God is\npresent to the world and the world influences God. Although the\npresence of the world in God could be understood as a form of\npantheism, process philosophy avoids collapsing the world into God or\nGod into the world by maintaining a distinction between God and the\nworld. This distinction is manifest in the eternality of God and the\ntemporality of the world. It is also apparent in the freedom of the\nevents in the world. Although God presents possibilities to the events\nin the world, each event “decides” how it will actualize\nthose possibilities. The freedom of each event, the absence of divine\ndetermination, provides a way for process thought to avoid God being\nthe cause of evil or containing evil as evil. Since God includes the\nevents of the world, God will include the evil as well as the good\nthat occurs in the world and this evil will affect God since the world\naffects God’s actualization. But, because God does not determine\nthe response of each event to the possibilities that God presents, any\nevent may reject God’s purpose of good through the\nintensification of experience and actualize a less intense experience.\nGod does take this less intense, evil, experience into God’s\nself, but redeems that evil by means of relating it to the ways in\nwhich good has been actualized. Thus, God saves what can be saved from\nthe world rather than simply including each event in isolation from\nother events (J. Cooper 2006, 174, 180). \nRecent developments of\npanentheism tend to continue the German Idealist tradition or the\ntradition of process philosophy. Although the majority of the\ncontemporary expressions of panentheism involve scientists and\nprotestant theologians or philosophers, articulations of forms of\npanentheism have also developed among feminists, in the Roman Catholic\ntradition, in the Orthodox tradition, and in religions other than\nChristianity. \nUtilizing resources from the tradition of German Idealism, Jürgen\nMoltmann developed a form of panentheism in his early work, The\nCrucified God in 1974 (1972 for the German original), where he\nsaid that the suffering and renewal of all humanity are taken into the\nlife of the Triune God. He explicated his understanding of panentheism\nmore fully in The Trinity and the Kingdom in 1981.\nTheological concerns motivate Moltmann’s concept of panentheism.\nPanentheism avoids the arbitrary concept of creation held by\nclassical theism and the loss of creaturely freedom that occurs in\nChristian pantheism (J. Cooper 2006, 248). Moltmann understands\npanentheism to involve both God in the world and the world in God. The\nrelationship between God and the world is like the relationship among\nthe members of the Trinity in that it involves relationships and\ncommunities (Molnar 1990, 674). Moltmann uses the concept of\nperichoresis to describe this relationship of mutual interpenetration.\nBy using the concept of perichoresis, Moltmann moves away from a\nHegelian understanding of the trinity as a dialectical development in\nhistory (J. Cooper 2006, 251). The relationship between God and the\nworld develops because of God’s nature as love that seeks the\nother and the free response of the other (Molnar 1990, 677). Moltmann\ndoes not consider creation necessary for God nor the result of any\ninner divine compulsion. Instead creation is the result of God’s\nessential activity as love rather than the result of God’s\nself-determination (Molnar 1990, 679). This creation occurs in a\nprocess of interaction between nothingness and creativity, contraction\nand expansion, in God. Because there is no “outside” of\nGod due to God’s infinity, God must withdraw in order for\ncreation to exist. Kenosis, or God’s self-emptying, occurs in\ncreation as well as in the incarnation. The nothing in the doctrine of\n“creation from nothing” is the primordial result of\nGod’s contraction of God’s essential infinity (J. Cooper\n2006, 247). Moltmann finds that panentheism as mutual interpenetration\npreserves unity and difference in a variety of differences in kind\nsuch as God and human being, person and nature, and the spiritual and\nthe sensuous (Moltmann 1996, 307). \nIn his process panentheism, David Ray Griffin assumes that scientific\nunderstandings of the world are crucial and recognizes the\nimplications of scientific understanding for theology. However, his\nconcept of panentheism builds on the principles of process philosophy\nrather than scientific concepts directly. Griffin traces modern\natheism to the combination of understanding perception as exclusively\nbased on physical sensations, accepting a naturalistic explanation of\nreality, and identifying matter as the only reality. But, the\nemergence of mind challenges the adequacy of this contemporary\nworldview (2004, 40–41). He claims that the\n supernaturalistic form of theism with its emphasis upon the divine\nwill does not provide an adequate alternative to the atheism of the\nlate modern worldview because God becomes the source of evil. Griffin\nargues that supernaturalistic theism makes God the source of evil because\nGod’s will establishes the general principles of the universe\n(2004, 37). Process panentheism provides a way to avoid the problems\nof both materialistic naturalism and classical theism (2004, 42).\nGriffin’s panexperientialism bases sensory perception on a\nnon-sensory mode of perception in order to explain both the mind-body\ninteraction and the God-world interaction. God and the world are\ndifferent entities but both are actual. They are numerically distinct\nbut ontologically the same, in Griffin’s terms, avoiding dualism\nand supernaturalism. God and events in the world interact through\nnon-sensory perception (2004, 44–45). Through this interaction,\nGod can influence but not determine the world, and the world can\ninfluence God’s concrete states without changing God’s\nessence. Process panentheism recognizes two aspects of the divine, an\nabstract and unchanging essence and a concrete state that involves\nchange. Through this dipolar concept, God both influences and is\ninfluenced by the world (2004, 43–44). Griffin understands God\nas essentially the soul of the universe although distinct from the\nworld. The idea of God as the soul of the world stresses the intimacy\nand direct relationship of God’s relationship to the world, not\nthe emergence of the soul from the world (2004, 44). Relationality is\npart of the divine essence, but this does not mean that this specific\nworld is necessary to God. This world came into existence from\nrelative nothingness. This relative nothingness was a chaos that\nlacked any individual that sustained specific characteristics over\ntime. However, even in the chaos prior to the creation of this world,\nevents had some degree of self-determination and causal influence upon\nsubsequent events. These fundamental causal principles along with God\nexist naturally since these causal principles are inherent in things\nthat exist including the nature of God. The principles cannot be\nbroken because such an interruption would be a violation of\nGod’s nature. An important implication of the two basic causal\nprinciples, a degree of self-determination and causal influence, is\nthat God influences but does not determine other events (2004, 43).\nGriffin’s understanding of naturalism allows for divine action\nthat is formally the same in all events. But this divine action can\noccur in a variable manner so that some acts are especially revelatory\nof the divine character and purpose (2004, 45). \nMuch of the contemporary discussion and development of panentheism\noccurs in the context of the science and religion discussion. The\nearly modern concept of an unchanging natural order posed a challenge\nto understandings of divine action in the world. The current\ndiscussion draws on the development of scientific information about\nthe natural world that can contribute to religious efforts to explain\nhow God acts in the world. In the contemporary discussion, Arthur\nPeacocke and Paul Davies have made important contributions as\nscientists interested in, and knowledgeable about, religion. Peacocke\ndeveloped his understanding of panentheism beginning in 1979 and\ncontinuing through works in 2001, 2004, and 2006. Peacocke starts with\nthe shift in the scientific understanding of the world from a\nmechanism to the current understandings of the world as a unity\ncomposed of complex systems in a hierarchy of different levels. These\nemergent levels do not become different types of reality but instead\ncompose a unity that can be understood naturally as an emergentist\nmonism. At the same time, the different levels of complexity cannot be\nreduced to an explanation of one type or level of complexity. The\ncreative dynamic of the emergence of complexity in hierarchies is\nimmanent in the world rather than external to the world (Peacocke\n2004, 137–142). Similarly, Paul Davies describes the universe by\ntalking about complexity and higher levels of organization in which\nparticipant observers bring about a more precise order (2007). An\nimportant scientific aspect of this concept of complexity and\norganization is the notion of entanglement especially conceptual level\nentanglement (Davies 2006, 45–48). Again, the organization,\nwhich makes life possible, is an internal, or natural, order rather\nthan an order imposed from outside of the universe (Davies 2004).\nPeacocke draws upon this contemporary scientific understanding of the\nuniverse to think about the relationship between God and the natural\nworld. He rejects any understanding of God as external to nature\nwhether it is a theistic understanding where God\nintervenes in the natural world or a deistic understanding where God\ninitiates the natural world but does not continue to be active in the\nworld. For Peacocke, God continuously creates through the processes of\nthe natural order. God’s active involvement is not an\nadditional, external influence upon events. However, God is not\nidentified with the natural processes, which are the action of God as\nCreator (Peacocke 2004, 143–144). Peacocke identifies his\nunderstanding of God’s relation to the world as panentheism\nbecause of its rejection of external interactions by God in favor of\nGod always working from inside the universe. At the same time, God\ntranscends the universe because God is more than the universe in the\nsense of God being unlimited by the world. This panentheistic model\ncombines a stronger emphasis upon God’s immanence with\nGod’s ultimate transcendence over the universe by using a model\nof personal agency (Peacocke 2004, 147–151). Davies also refers\nto his understanding of the role of laws in nature as panentheism\nrather than deism because God chose laws that give a co-creative role\nto nature (2004, 104. \nPhilip Clayton begins with contemporary scientific understandings of\nthe world and combines them with theological concepts drawn from a\nvariety of sources including process theology. He describes\nGod’s relationship with the world as an internal rather than an\nexternal relationship. Understanding God’s relationship as\ninternal to the world recognizes the validity of modern scientific\nunderstandings that do not require any external source in order to\naccount for the order in the world. At the same time, God’s\ninternal presence provides the order and regularity that the world\nmanifests (2001, 208–210). Clayton agrees that the world is in\nGod and God is in the world. Panentheism, according to him, affirms\nthe interdependence of God and the world (2004a, 83). This affirmation\nbecame possible as a result of the rejection of substantialistic\nlanguage in favor of personal language in thinking of God.\nSubstantialistic language excludes all other actualities from any one\nactuality. Rejection of substantialistic language thus allows for the\ninteraction of beings. Clayton cites Hegel’s recognition that\nthe logic of the infinite requires the inclusion of the finite in the\ninfinite and points towards the presence of the world in God (Clayton\n2004a, 78–79). Clayton, along with Joseph Bracken (1974, 2004),\nidentifies panentheism as Trinitarian and kenotic\n(Clayton 2005, 255). It is Trinitarian because the world participates\nin God in a manner analogous to the way that members of the Trinity\nparticipate in each other although the world is not and does not\nbecome God. God freely decides to limit God’s infinite power in\nan act of kenosis in order to allow for the existence of non-divine\nreality. The divine kenotic decision results in the actuality of the\nworld that is taken into God. But, for Clayton, God’s inclusion\nof finite being as actual is contingent upon God’s decision\nrather than necessary to God’s essence (2003, 214). Clayton\naffirms creation from nothing as a description of creaturely existence\nprior to God’s decision. The involvement of the world in an\ninternal relationship with God does not completely constitute the\ndivine being for Clayton. Instead, God is both primordial, or eternal,\nand responsive to the world. The world does constitute God’s\nrelational aspect but not the totality of God (2005, 250–254).\nThe best way to describe the interdependence between God and the world\nfor Clayton is through the concept of emergence. Emergence may be\nexplanatory, epistemological, or ontological. Ontological\nunderstandings of emergence, which Clayton supports, hold (1) monism\nbut not physicalism, (2) properties emerge in objects from the\npotentiality of an object that cannot be previously identified in the\nobject’s parts or structure, (3) the emergence of new properties\ngiving rise to distinct levels of causal relations, and (4) downward\ncausation of the emergent level upon prior levels (2006a, 2–4).\nEmergence recognizes that change is important to the nature of the\nworld and challenges views of God as unchanging (Clayton 2006b,\n320). \nA number of feminists advocate panentheism by critiquing traditional\nunderstandings of transcendence for continuing dualistic ways of\nthinking. Feminist panentheists conceive of the divine as continuous\nwith the world rather than being ontologically transcendent over the\nworld (Frankenberry 2011). Sallie McFague’s use of metaphors in\nboth theology and science led her to describe the world as God’s\nbody. McFague bases the metaphorical nature of all statements about\nGod upon panentheism (2001, 30). Furthermore, for McFague,\npanentheism sees the world as in God which gives priority to\nGod’s name but includes each person’s name and preserves\ntheir distinctiveness in the divine reality (2001, 5). God’s\nglory becomes manifest in God’s total self-giving to the world\nso that transcendence becomes immanence rather than being understood\nas God’s power manifest in distant control of the world. Grace\nJantzen also uses the metaphor of the world as God’s body.\nAdditionally, Jantzen (1998) and Gloria Schaab (2007) have proposed metaphors\nabout the womb and midwifery to describe God’s relation to the\nworld. Anna Case–Winters challenges McFague’s metaphor of\nthe world as God’s body. Case–Winters acknowledges that\nthis metaphor maintains God’s personal nature, offers a coherent\nway to talk about God’s knowledge of and action in the world,\nrecognizes God’s vulnerable suffering love, and revalues nature\nand embodiment. But at least McFague’s early use of the\nworld-as-God’s-body metaphor tended towards pantheism and even\nher later introduction of an agential role for the divine still\nretains the possibility of the loss of the identity of the world.\nCase–Winters uses Jay McDaniel’s (1989) distinction between\nemanational, arising out of the being of the One, and relational,\npresent through relationship, understandings of God’s immanence\nin the world to establish a form of panentheism with a clearer\ndistinction between God and the world. The world is an\n“other” in relation to God rather than being a direct\nexpression of God’s own being through emanation for\nCase–Winters (30–32). Nancy Frankenberry contrasts\nMcFague’s and Case–Winter’s two concepts of\ntranscendence to the traditional hierarchical concept of\ntranscendence. McFague’s concept is one of total immanence while\nCase–Winters holds a dialectic between individual transcendence\nand immanence (2011). Frankenberry suggests that pantheism may provide\na more direct repudiation of male domination than panentheism provides\n(1993). \nAlthough much of the development of panentheism takes place in the\ncontext of the Christian tradition, connections between other world\nreligions and panentheism have been identified. These connections\nrange from explicitly panentheistic traditions, to similarities to\nspecific beliefs and practices of a tradition, to beliefs and\npractices that could be developed into panentheistic positions.\nHartshorne in his discussion of panentheism included a section on\nHinduism (1953). Lorilai Biernacki considers Hinduism to be one of the\nmost panentheistic traditions (Biernacki 2014b). The concept of the\nworld as the body of the divine offers a strong similarity to Western\npanentheism. The Gita identifies the whole world, including\nall the gods and living creatures, as the Divine body. But the Divine\nBeing has its own body that contains the world while being more than\nthe world. While the Upanishads acknowledge the body of the Divine at\ntimes, the body of the divine is never identified as the cosmos. Most\nof the Tantrics hold a pantheistic view in which the practitioner is a\nmanifestation of the divine. Abhinavagupta, in the tenth century,\nprovided the first panentheistic understanding of the world as\nGod’s body. For him, differentiation is Shiva concealing his\nwholeness. Abhinavagupta also insisted that Shiva transcends the\ncosmos (Bilimoria and Stansell 2010, 244–258; Clayton 2010,\n187–189; and Barua 2010, 1–30. See also Hardy 2016;\nSilberstein 2017; and Stavig 2017). Other traditions where connections\nto panentheism have been found include Judaism (Artson 2014 and\nLangton 2016), Jainism (Chapple 2014), Confucianism (Lee 2014),\nBuddhism (Samuel 2014), and Sufism (Sharify–Funk and Dickson\n2014). While these connections might imply a universalistic theology,\npanentheism affirms the importance of all religions and supports\ninter–religions dialogue (Biernacki 2014a, 6, 10). \nThe feminist discussion about the adequacy of the metaphor of the\nworld as God’s body points toward an issue in the broader\npanentheistic discussion about how to describe the relationship\nbetween God and the world and the adequacy of the specific metaphors\nthat have been used. McFague argues that any attempt to do theology\nrequires the use of metaphor (2001, 30). Clayton proposes different\nlevels of metaphor as the most adequate way to reconcile the conflict\nbetween divine action and the integrity of the created realm (2003,\n208). For Peacocke, the limitation of language requires the use of\nmodels and metaphors in describing both God and the cosmos (Schabb\n2008, 13. The dominant metaphor in panentheism has been the world as\nGod’s body. The primary objection to the world as God’s\nbody is the substantialistic implications of the term\n“body” that lead either to an ontological separation\nbetween the world and God or to a loss of identity for God or the\nworld. Further, Bracken finds that the soul–body metaphor lacks\nclarity about the freedom and self–identity of the creatures in\nrelations to God (1992, 211). Case–Winters faults the\nsoul–body metaphor for tending to see the soul as dominating the\nbody and failing to recognize the world as a unified organism (1995\n251, 254). Metaphors may be helpful, but they are never literal and\nthus fail to describe precisely the actualities involved. Beyond the\ndifficulty of the soul–body metaphor the multiplicity of ways\nthat panentheists describe the mutual relationship between God and the\nworld indicates a vagueness of understanding of the ontology of the\nrelation between God and the world. The attempt to describe the\nGod–world relation by use of the term “in” also\nconfronts the problem of a lack of precision in understanding the\nontological nature of the relation due to the variety of meanings of\n“in”. \nMore clearly metaphysical understandings of God’s relation to\nthe world have been articulated. Schelling’s German idealism\nunderstood God as freely unfolding emanation by introducing\nsubjectivity. Emanation avoids ontological separation between God and the\nworld because the world participates in the infinite as its source\n(Clayton 2000, 477–481). Krause understood the world’s\nparticipation in God both ontologically and epistemically. The\nparticularity of each existent being depends upon the Absolute for its\nexistence as what it is (Göcke 2013a, 372). Keller offers another\nmetaphysical understanding by arguing for creation out of chaos. She\nrejects substance metaphysics and describes the relation between God\nand the world as a complex relationality involving an active\nindeterminacy and past realities (2003, 219). Finally the science and\nreligion discussion provides another metaphysical understanding by\ndrawing upon scientific concepts of supervenience, emergence, downward\ncausation, and entanglement to provide a ground for theological\nconcepts of God’s relation to the world. \nThe nature of the mutual relationship between the infinite and the\nfinite is crucial to the claim by panentheism to be a creative\nalternative to classical Christian theism and pantheism. The\npanentheistic mutual relation between the infinite and the finite\ndiffers from Classical Christian theism which prioritizes\ntranscendence by deriving divine immanence from divine\ntranscendence. The panentheistic mutual relation also differs from\npantheism which prioritizes divine immanence by identifying the\ninfinite with the finite. The nature of this mutual relationship\nbasically depends upon the understanding of the ontology of each\nmember of the relationship. The issue is the nature of being for God\nand for the world as the basis for mutual influence between God and\nthe world. A variety of attempts have sought to describe the nature of\nGod’s being and the world’s being in their\nrelationship. Thomistic thought utilizes a concept of analogy as it\nwrestles with the nature of the being of God and the being of the\nworld (Malloy 2014). Others in considering God’s action in the\nworld posit the necessity of ontological difference between God and\nfinite reality (Leidenhag 2014, 219). Process thought directly\naddresses the issue of ontology by calling for an ontology that does\nnot consider substance as the basic type of existence because\nsubstance does not allow for internal relations (Bracken 2014,\n10). According to Wesley Wildman the relations between entities are\nontologically more fundamental than the entities themselves for\nrelational ontology in contrast to substantivist ontology where\nentities are ontologically primary and relations derivative (2010,\n55). \nHistorically, participation, Hegelian dynamic ontology, and process\ndynamic ontology have been utilized to describe the ontological basis\nfor the relations between God and the world. Participation has\nphilosophical antecedents in Plato and Aristotle and was utilized in\nAugustinian and Orthodox Christian traditions. In participation, the\nexistence of the world somehow takes part in God’s being. Early\nmodern usage of the concept of participation appears in the thought of\nKrause (1781–1832) and Sergei Bulgakov (1871–1944). Krause\nidentifies the character of every thing as the result of its\nparticipation in the original unity of the Absolute. But the Absolute\nis still different in its internal constitution from its parts\n(Göcke 2013a, 372). Bulgakov describes participation as the\ninclusion of the finite by the Absolute (Gavrilyuk 2015, 453).\nHegelian dynamic ontology describes an Infinite which gives rise to\nthe finite through a dialectical process of negation. The finite\nthrough a second reciprocal negation of its finitude brings about\nunion and return in transformation to both the Infinite and the finite\n(Williams 2010, 143). Process dynamic ontology understands God as\ndipolar with a primordial nature that is eternal and a consequent\nnature that includes the actualizations achieved by the world. God\npresents possibilities to the events of the world which then make\ndecisions bringing about actualities that are then included in\nGod. \nBracken and Cazalis seek to make the ontological nature of the\nrelation more precise. Bracken proposes a Trinitarian field theory to\nexplain the world’s presence in God. The world is a large but\nfinite field of activity within the all–comprehensive field of\nactivity constituted by the three divine persons in ongoing relations\nwith each other and with all the creation (2009, 159). Bracken’s\nTrinitarian field theory draws on systems theory from science,\nWhitehead’s concept of society, and Christian Trinitarian\ndoctrine. A society as a type of system is a group of entities with an\norganizing principle. Basically, reality is an all–encompassing\nsociety in which subsocieties operate in their own ways as distinct.\nGod functions as the regnant subsociety and receives the richness of\nthe information from the world of creation (Bracken 2014, 80). Bracken\nsummarizes this system understanding of panentheism in three\nconclusions: (1) systems are social rather than individual, can be\ncombined horizontally and vertically, change over time due to changes\nin constituents, and do not make decisions; (2) the three divine\npersons and all their creatures are together constituent members of an\nexpanded divine life–system; and (3) the relationships of the\nvarious levels of societies involve both bottom–up causation and\nan objective formal top–down causation of the constraints of\nhigher order systems on lower order systems (2015a, 223). Although not\nas fully developed as Bracken’s society explanation, Cazalis\nuses category theory and the concept of adjunction in order to offer\nan internal law that gives specificity to panentheism. In this\napproach relations go both ways between two categories and the link\ncarries the universal property from one element of a given category to\nanother category (Cazalis 2016, 210). \nPanentheism continues to grow and change. Much of this growth has\ntaken place as a result of advances in science and conversations with\nscience. Another impetus for change has been criticisms of\npanentheism. These criticisms have taken two forms. One form, by major\nalternatives to panentheistic understandings of the God-world\nrelation, has criticized the adequacy of panentheism. Panentheism\nfaces challenges both from those who resist any lessening of the\nemphasis upon divine transcendence and from those who find pantheism\nmore adequate than any system distinguishing between God and the\nworld. Recently, an important criticism, especially from Analytic\ntheology, has been that panentheism lacks the distinctiveness needed\nto identify it precisely enough to distinguish it from other forms of\ntheism, critique it, and further its development. Finally, the variety\nof the versions of panentheism has led to an active internal\ndiscussion among the various versions. \nBoth pantheists and scientists working with naturalist assumptions\ncriticize panentheism for its metaphysical claim that there is a being\nabove or other than the natural world. At times, this criticism has\nbeen made by claiming that a thorough-going naturalism does not need a\ntranscendent, individualized reality. Robert Corrington describes the\ndevelopment of his thought as a growing awareness that panentheism\nunnecessarily introduces a being above nature as well as in nature\n(2002, 49). William Drees expresses a similar criticism by arguing that all\ncontemporary explanations of human agency, including non-reductionist\nexplanations, are naturalistic and do not require any reference to a\nhigher being. For panentheists to claim that divine agency is\nanalogous to human agency fails both to recognize that human agency\nrequires no additional source or cause and to explain how a divine\nsource of being could act in the realm of physical and mental\nprocesses (1999). Frankenberry makes this objection more specific.\nPanentheism offers a more complex relationship between God and the\nworld than is necessary. This unnecessary complexity is revealed by\nthe problems that panentheism has with the logic of the freedom of\nparts in wholistic relations, the possibility of the body-soul analogy\nrelapsing into gender inflected ideas of the soul as the male\nprinciple, the problem with simultaneity of events in the divine\nexperience in relation to the principle of the relativity of time, the\nnecessity of the everlasting nature of value, and finally the use of\nthe ontological argument to establish the necessity of the abstract\npole of the divine nature (1993, 36–39). Carl Gillett points out that\npanentheism lacks an explanation for a causal efficacy higher than the\ncausal efficacy realized by microphysical causation (2003, 19).\nGenerally, panentheists respond to these criticisms by claiming the\ninadequacy both scientifically and metaphysically of any type of\nreductionistic naturalism. Such a naturalism whether articulated in\nscientific categories or religious categories fails to recognize the\nemergence of levels of complexity in nature. The emergence of higher\nlevels of organization that cannot be completely explained in terms of\nlower levels renders non-differentiated accounts of being inadequate.\nPanentheists often argue that the emergence of higher levels of order\nmakes possible downward causation. Davies describes the difficulties\nin coming to a clear description of downward causation and concludes\nthat the complexity of systems open to the environment makes room for\ndownward causation but has not yet provided an explanation of how\ndownward causation works (2006, 48). The concepts of entanglement and\ndivine entanglement may offer a new perspective on causation and\nespecially the role of the divine in natural causation\n(Wegter–McNelly 2011). Christian theists raise a variety of critiques of\npanentheism. Experiential critiques question the ability of\npanentheism to provide a God worthy of worship (Nash 1983, 117). One\nresponse to this critique is to question the definition of\n“worthy of worship”. Brian Leftow suggests that any\ndefinition of God as meriting worship includes a conceptually\nappropriate object that is aware of the world and being superior to\nthe world in some way (2016, 70). A closely related experiential\ncritique is that the panentheistic God is unable to guarantee a future\ngood. While panentheists agree that human freedom logically precludes\nGod’s prevention of future evil that results from human choice,\nmany affirm that God’s response to unpreventable evil is that\nGod suffers with the person suffering evil. However God’s\nsuffering with a person does not offer any guarantee that evil will be\novercome. But, the support of a relationship with God may offer a\nbasis for the hope of overcoming evil. \nThese experiential criticisms express underlying theological\ncritiques. The dominant theological criticism of panentheism is that\nGod is unable to guarantee the defeat of evil. Clayton and Bracken\nrespond by maintaining that the world does influence God but\nGod’s will, expressed through the decisions that God makes,\nprotects God’s ability to save (Clayton 2005). Moltmann\ndescribes God’s essence as directing God’s activity in\norder to maintain the reliability of God as love acting on behalf of\ncreation. Moltmann does not find it necessary to protect divine\nfreedom by giving it priority over divine love but rather understands\nfreedom as acting according to the divine nature of love (Moltmann\n1981, 98, 99). J. Cooper challenges this response by criticizing\npanentheism for holding a concept of God that can save through the\ngeneral processes of nature but not in any distinctive way.  Kevin\nVanhoozer’s concern about divine freedom is based on a similar\nconcern (1998, 250). But, Griffin’s discussion of divine\nvariable action does allow for specific and distinctive manifestations\nof divine love (2004, 45). Alexander Jensen also criticizes the\nability of the panentheist concept to save by distinguishing between\nsalvation by God and salvation through agents of their own salvation\n(2014, 12–13). For him, a process panentheist’s God can\nonly draw and persuade rather than save (Jensen 2014, 128). Kenneth\nPak concludes that an open future makes any ultimate victory over evil\nimpossible (Pak 2014, 223–224). In response, B. Cooper lists\nfive ways in which a process theology supports God’s power over\nother realities: (1) ontological priority in providing definition, (2)\nuniversality to all actuality, (3) as the ground of novelty, (4) as\nthe ground and preserver of all value, and (5) the unconditioned\ncharacter of God’s integrity as seeking to increase value in the\nworld and love towards the world (1974, 102). Palmyre Oomen finds\nthree similar elements in Whitehead’s thought that relate to\nGod’s governing and sustaining the world: (1) God originates all\noccasions by presenting the initial aim which provides some direction\nagainst evil, (2) God preserves all that can be preserved, and (3) God\nas everlasting means that no occasion can overcome God forever (2015,\n287–288). An additional criticism is that since God and the\nworld are interdependent in the classic panentheism of Hegel and\nWhitehead, God is not free to choose to create and to save. The\nnecessity of the world for God loses grace as the source of creation\nand redemption. God’s provision of salvation then becomes\nnecessary rather than free. While Roger Olson questions whether or not\na classic panentheist can hold to creation from nothing (Olson 2012,\nin Other Internet Resources), Clayton affirms creation from nothing as\nconsistent with panentheism (2008).  Ultimately the panentheist\nresponse is that God’s nature as love directs God’s\nactions bringing salvation. God’s nature as love is the crucial\naspect of divine action rather than a causal efficacy. The emphasis of\nclassical theism on divine will misses that the divine will is\ndirected by divine love (Oord 2015 and Molnar, 1990, 679). \nMetaphysical critiques of panentheism provide a basis for both the\ntheological and experiential criticisms made by Christian\ntheists. Four types of metaphysical critiques have been made. One\ncriticism is that panentheism fails to maintain an ontological\ndistinction between God and the world (Leidenhag 2014, 215, 219, 220).\nWhile panentheism identifies differences between God and the world,\nthe distinction is one of characteristics rather than one of being.\nAlthough different forms of panentheism understand similarities and\ndifferences between God and the world in different ways, both Hegel\nand Whitehead refer to differences between God and the world that are\nimportant. Hegel’s dialectical panentheism distinguishes between\nGod prior to creation and creation in God (Tabaczek 2013, 151).\nWhitehead describes God as non–temporal and events composing the\nworld as temporal (Bracken 2015, 542). The modal status of the world\nin relation to God provides a related challenge to panentheism.\nGöcke concludes that the significant difference between\npanentheism and classical theism is that according to panentheism the\nworld is an intrinsic property of God while classical theism holds\nthat the world is an extrinsic property of God (2013b, 74). A third\ntype of critique is that panentheism holds an inadequate concept of\ntranscendence. According to J. Cooper, if God’s transcendence\ndoes not infinitely exceed God’s immanence, God’s\npresence, knowledge, and power are limited rather than complete,\nimmediate, and unconditioned (2006, 322–328). Whitehead’s\nunderstanding of God’s transcendence is limited because God only\ninfluences events before or after the decisions of the events. God\ncannot be present simultaneously with the event. Likewise,\nHegel’s denial of divine simplicity makes ontological difference\nbetween God and the world impossible thus limiting God’s\ntranscendence (Tabaczek 2013, 151, 154). While Clayton and others have\nidentified top–down causation as indicating God’s vertical\ntranscendence, Jensen finds this inadequate because they are unable to\nidentify clearly God’s presence in the causal nexus of the world\n(2014, 131). However, Bracken rejects the necessity of a causal joint\nwhen both top–down and bottom–up causation take place\n(2014, 10). Also, Clayton counters that few process panentheists\naccept a full equality between finite actual occasions and the divine\nactual occasion or occasions. God being the chief exemplification of\ncreativity indicates a difference between God and actual occasions and\nthus a vertical transcendence (Clayton 2015b, 27). Finally,\nBracken’s field understanding of panentheism gives priority to\nGod as the regent subsociety (2014, 79–80). The fourth\nmetaphysical criticism grows out of a technical aspect of\nWhitehead’s cosmology, the relation between creativity and God.\nWhitehead attributes metaphysical ultimacy to creativity and\nunderstands God as the primordial manifestation of creativity. This\nappears to leave God in a secondary position (Hosinski 2015, 275).\nCobb resolves the problem of the priority of creativity by identifying\ncreativity as an abstract metaphysical principle rather than an\nactuality more important than God (1982, 126 and see Nobharu 2015,\n499). Bracken considers creativity to be the systematic whole rather\nthan a greater reality than God (1992, 216, 214). \nAnalytic theology (Jeanine Diller and Asa Kasher, eds. 2013 and Andrei\nA. Buckareff and Yujin Nagasawa, eds. 2016) offers a different type of\ncritique of panentheism. Analytical approaches to panentheism critique\npanentheism as lacking a distinctive identity making careful\nidentification, research, and development of a distinctive position\nimpossible. Two responses to this challenge to identify the\ndistinctiveness of panentheism have developed. One response seeks to\nidentify a defining characteristic. The second response affirms the\nrichness of diversity and suggest certain commonalities distinguish\npanentheism from other forms of theism.\n \nBenedikt Göcke’s effort to identify a specific characteristic\nof panentheism notes the similarities of classical theism and\npanentheism and concludes that the crucial difference is a modal\ndifference in that the world is not necessary for God in classical\ntheism while the world is necessary for God in panentheism\n(2013). Raphael Lataster challenges Göcke’s limitation of\nthe distinction between classical theism and panentheism by claiming\nthat panentheism’s rejection of divine immutability\ndistinguishes panentheism from classical theism (2014). Göcke\nrejects this distinction as failing to recognize that spatial\nreferences are not adequate in dealing with metaphysical rather than\nphysical or logical necessity (2014). Göcke makes the\nrequirements for the distinction between classical theism and\npanentheism more specific by calling for a consistent definition of\n“in” by panentheists and by noting the presence of\nlogically contradictory but self-consistent interpretations of key\nnotions by various panentheists (2015). Yujin Nagasawa develops the\nconcept of modal panentheism by describing modal panentheism as\nholding that God is the totality of all possible worlds and that all\npossible worlds exist to the same extent that the actual world\nexists. Thus, God includes all possible worlds and any actual\nworlds. But Nagasawa also notes that modal panentheism has some\nsimilarities to classical theism which limits any modal distinction\nbetween classical theism and panentheism (2016). R. T. Mullins\nprovides further evidence and refinement in identifying the\ndistinctiveness of panentheism by pointing out similarities among\npanentheism, open theism, and neo-classical theism and by critiquing\nGöcke’s modal distinction as failing to say anything unique\nabout God. Both modal distinctions and considering the world as\nGod’s body fail because they do not say anything unique about\nthe nature of God (2016). Mullins offers an analytic response to the\nchallenge regarding the distinctiveness of panentheism by suggesting\nthat panentheism can distinguish itself from classical theism by\nmaking absolute space and time attributes of God and by recognizing\nthe distinction between absolute time and space and physical and\ntemporal realities contained within absolute time and space. Such a\ndistinction offers a literal understanding of “in” in\ncontrast to classical theism (2016). Oliver Crisp critiques\nMullins’s identification of absolute space and time as\nattributes of God because that appears to make God spatial and\ntemporal (2019, 30–31).\n \nOne type of response to the challenge that panentheism lacks a\ndistinctive characteristic suggests a symmetrical, mutual relation\nbetween God and the universe as the crucial characteristic of\npanentheism (Griffin 2004, 43–44; Keller 2008, 73; Clayton 215a,\n189; Gregersen 2004, 20, 22, 23; J. Cooper 2006, 29; Olson 2013, 330;\nMeister 2017, 5; Henricksen 2017, 1084; Stenmark 2019, 27; Gasser\n2019, 50).\n \nA variety of terms have been used to describe a mutual relation\nbetween God and the universe. Daniel Dombrowski (1996, 32) described\nGod’s relation to the universe as an organic relation in that\nGod and the universe influence each other. Niels Gregersen (2004, 20),\ncited by Stenmark (2019, 29), uses the phrase “bilateral\nrelations”. Stenmark calls God’s relation to the world an\n“ontological symmetrical” relation in comparison to\nclassical theism’s “asymmetrical” ontological\ndependence. The basic nature of a mutual relation between God and the\nuniverse involves an influence of each member of the relationship on\nthe other member and assumes some degree of independence or freedom of\neach member. \nA mutual relation differs from the more specific understanding of the\nGod/world relation in classical Christian theism. Panentheism and\nclassical Christian theism both distinguish between God and the\nworld. Classical theism identifies this as an ontological\ndifference. God’s being differs from the being of the\nworld. Göcke calls this a model difference in which God’s\nexistence is necessary while the world’s existence is contingent\n(2013b). Stenmark describes this as God being ontologically distinct\nfrom the world in classical theism and contrasts that with panentheism\nas holding that God ontologically includes the world (2019, 19, 27 and\nGöcke 2017, 5–6). At times, classical Christian theism\nmaintains the ontological difference between God and the world while\nallowing for the influence of the world upon God by distinguishing\nbetween God’s ontological nature and God’s conceptual\nknowledge of the world or God’s compassion for the world\n(Göcke 2017, 3). Classical Christian theism recognizes that\nbiblical statements (see I Kings 21 and Jonah 3) can be found\nindicating that God has changed because of something that happened in\nthe world, but such statements are identified as anthropomorphism\nthat try to communicate God’s actions without indicating any\nchange in either God’s nature or will. God’s knowledge may\nchange as the world changes and God’s care may respond to\ndifferent events in the world, but God’s existence or essence is\nnot changed (Stenmark 2019, 30). While God is immanent and active in\nthe world as well as transcendent for classical Christian theism, the\nrelationship between God and the universe is asymmetrical in that God\ninfluences the universe, but the universe does not affect God\n(J. Cooper, 2006, 18, 22 and Stenmark 2019, 30). The world changes\nbecause of God’s presence in the world, but this dynamic\nrelationship does not indicate any change in God’s nature or\nwill.\n \nThe balance between God’s transcendence and God’s\nimmanence further refines the distinctiveness of panentheism’s\nmutual relation between God and the universe in distinction from both\nclassical Christian theism and pantheism.  By deriving divine\nimmanence from divine transcendence, classical Christian theism\nprioritizes God’s transcendence (J. Cooper 2006, 328). In\ncontrast, Gregersen (2004, 19) balances transcendence and immanence.\nThus, panentheism affirms the basic role of divine immanence.\nLikewise, in contrast to pantheism’s derivation of divine\ntranscendence from divine immanence, panentheism affirms God’s\ntranscendence from the world.  David Nikkel recognizes the importance\nof this balance even within panentheism. He warns against an\noveremphasis upon transcendence leading to the loss of the\nindeterminacy needed for growth that occurs in panentheism overly\ninfluenced by German idealism and an overemphasis on immanence leading\nto the loss of God as the source of existence that occurs in\npanentheism overly influenced by process thought (2016). The classical\nChristian tradition due to a variety of influences such as Platonic\ninfluence that stressed the reality of the forms in contrast to matter\nshaped by the forms (see Straus 2010) has tended to understand God as\nan unrelated Other to ordinary existence. Prioritizing divine\ntranscendence by calling for a deity unlimited by events in the world\nas seen in the doctrine of creation from nothing limits\ncreation’s freedom to impact divine actions. While the biblical\ntradition describes God as creator and sustainer of the creation, many\nassumed that the ability to create and sustain depended upon the\notherness of God in comparison to creation. While divine immanence is\nnot denied by the classical Christian tradition, divine immanence\nderives from divine transcendence.  Transcendence over all specific\nrelations enables the immanence of the divine relation to all of\nreality. God is present to all of reality because God exists\nindependently from all other reality and is uninfluenced by other\nreality. This separation of divine reality from ordinary, created\nreality makes the relationship of the divine to all of created reality\nan external relationship.  The external nature of this relationship\nbecome apparent in deviations from the classical Christian tradition\nsuch as deism. Because of the assumed external nature of God’s\nrelation to creation, God cannot logically be conceived of as being\naffected by created reality. God’s freedom is only possible if\nGod is not affected in any way by created reality.  God then does not\nrespond in any way to the created order but acts without consideration\nof the events of the world. \nOn the other hand, prioritizing divine immanence even when that\nincludes the influence of other realities, fails to retain a robust\nconcept of divine transcendence.  The postmodern theological tradition\noffers an alternative understanding of the divine–created\nrelationship that considers God as wholly immanent. (See Barber 2014,\n41–76.) This emphasis upon divine immanence seeks to affirm the\npresence of God in the world. While some forms of this interest lead\nto pantheism and the identity of God with the creation, the emphasis\nupon immanence recognizes the need for a source of newness and novelty\nthat is not limited by, or to, the past. The basis for this novelty is\ninternal to created reality rather than an external reality providing\nnovelty. However, the question about the adequacy of the novelty for\nthe present situation must be considered.  The transcendence involved\nin the emphasis upon immanence is a horizontal rather than a vertical\ntranscendence. A horizontal transcendence involves beings of the same\nontological status. For example, a person differs from other persons\nand thus in a sense transcends the limitation of other peoples’\nexperiences just as they are not limited to the first person’s\nexperiences. Newness and novelty then arise from the unrealized\npotentials in the original situation. However, this limitation risks\nmaking radical novelty impossible because the context always limits\nthe possibilities. In response to an emphasis upon transcendence, the\nemphasis upon immanence clearly affirms the value and importance of\nthe creation. But at the same time that it affirms the value an\nimportance of creation, the creation is a limited creation incapable\nof being more than what is already in some way present in the\ncreation. \nThe second type of response recognizes the diversity of types of\npanentheism and rejects identifying panentheism by means of a single\ncharacteristic (Lataster and Bilimoria 2018, 57–58). This leads\nto several suggestions about ways to identify the commonality among\nthe diverse expressions of panentheism. Michael Brierly finds eight\ncommon themes in panentheism although all eight themes may not be\npresent in each expression of panentheism (2004, 6–8). Gregersen\nidentifies a core common to all forms of panentheism, God contains the\nworld so that the world belongs to God and there is a feeding back\nfrom the world into divine life (2017, 582). This common then is\nexpressed in a variety of forms of panentheism as particular\ntheologies (Gregersen 2017, 583). Stenmark describes panentheism as\nhaving core doctrines and extension claims (2019, 23). Panentheism and\nclassical theism share extension claims that God the creator of the\nworld and that continued existence of the world depends upon God’s\nongoing creative activity. Both panentheism and classical theism\nmaintain the immanence of God, but they differ in that panentheism\nholds that God ontologically includes the world while classical theism\nmaintains an ontological distinction between God and creation. For\nStenark, the core claims of panentheism are that God ontologically\nincludes the world and that God depends on the world for God’s own\nexistence (2019, 25–26). Clayton suggests that panentheism be\nconsidered a philosophical research program which may include\nsub–research programs. The panentheistic research program\naffirms the pervasiveness of change with real change taking place in\nhe divine experience but not in he divine nature. Since panentheists\ndiffer on whether creation is from nothing or is necessary this is a\nsub–research program within panentheism (Clayton 2019,\n9–10). \nWhile the idea of panentheism may not be a philosophically stable\nconcept in itself, that instability makes possible respecification in\nlight of particular theologies (Gregersen 2017, 583). Thus the term\n“panentheism” pointed to a balance between classical\ntheism and pantheism in the early twentieth century with its use of\n“in”. The growth of the influence of scientific thought\nupon theology leads to a more specific understanding of the balance in\nthe relation between God and the world that emphasizes the mutual\ninteraction of God and the world and moves on from the usefulness of\n“in”. \nThe varieties of panentheism participate in internal criticism.\nClayton (2008, 127) and Steven Crain (2006) emphasize the dependence\nof the world upon God rather than the dependence of God upon the world\nalthough they maintain that God is influenced, and changed, by the\nworld. They criticize understandings of God that limit God by making\nGod subject to metaphysical principles. Griffin emphasizes the\nregularity provided by metaphysical principles. This regularity\nrecognizes the order in reality that the reliability of God’s\nlove provides. Panentheists also caution that the emphasis upon the\nontological nature of the relation between God and the world can lead\nto a loss of the integrity of the world. Richardson warns against\nlosing the discrete identity of finite beings in God (2010, 345).\nCase-Winters calls for maintaining a balance between the distinction\nbetween God and the world and God’s involvement with the world.\nOver–emphasis upon either side of the balance leads to positions\nthat are philosophically and theologically inadequate\n(Case–Winters 2007, 125).","contact.mail":"jculp@apu.edu","contact.domain":"apu.edu"}]
