Ancient and Medieval\nphilosophers might have said that metaphysics was, like chemistry or\nastrology, to be defined by its subject-matter: metaphysics was the\n“science” that studied “being as such” or\n“the first causes of things” or “things that do not\nchange”. It is no longer possible to define metaphysics that\nway, for two reasons. First, a philosopher who denied the existence of\nthose things that had once been seen as constituting the\nsubject-matter of metaphysics—first causes or unchanging\nthings—would now be considered to be making thereby a\nmetaphysical assertion. Second, there are many philosophical\nproblems that are now considered to be metaphysical problems (or at\nleast partly metaphysical problems) that are in no way related to\nfirst causes or unchanging things—the problem of free will, for\nexample, or the problem of the mental and the physical.\n\nThe first three sections of this entry examine a broad selection of\nproblems considered to be metaphysical and discuss ways in which the\npurview of metaphysics has expanded over time. We shall see that the\ncentral problems of metaphysics were significantly more unified in the\nAncient and Medieval eras. Which raises a question—is there any\ncommon feature that unites the problems of contemporary metaphysics?\nThe final two sections discuss some recent theories of the nature and\nmethodology of metaphysics. We will also consider arguments that\nmetaphysics, however defined, is an impossible enterprise.\n\nThe word ‘metaphysics’ is notoriously hard to define.\nTwentieth-century coinages like ‘meta-language’ and\n‘metaphilosophy’ encourage the impression that metaphysics\nis a study that somehow “goes beyond” physics, a study\ndevoted to matters that transcend the mundane concerns of Newton and\nEinstein and Heisenberg. This impression is mistaken. The word\n‘metaphysics’ is derived from a collective title of the\nfourteen books by Aristotle that we currently think of as making up\nAristotle's Metaphysics. Aristotle himself did not know\nthe word. (He had four names for the branch of philosophy that is the\nsubject-matter of Metaphysics: ‘first philosophy’,\n‘first science’, ‘wisdom’, and\n‘theology’.) At least one hundred years after Aristotle's\ndeath, an editor of his works (in all probability, Andronicus of\nRhodes) titled those fourteen books “Ta meta ta\nphusika”—“the after the physicals” or\n“the ones after the physical ones”—the\n“physical ones” being the books contained in what we now\ncall Aristotle's Physics. The title was probably meant to warn\nstudents of Aristotle's philosophy that they should attempt\nMetaphysics only after they had mastered “the physical\nones”, the books about nature or the natural world—that is\nto say, about change, for change is the defining feature of the\nnatural world. This is the probable meaning of the title because Metaphysics is\nabout things that do not change. In one place, Aristotle identifies\nthe subject-matter of first philosophy as “being as such”,\nand, in another as “first causes”. It is a nice—and\nvexed—question what the connection between these two definitions\nis. Perhaps this is the answer: The unchanging first causes have\nnothing but being in common with the mutable things they\ncause. Like us and the objects of our experience—they are,\nand there the resemblance ceases. (For a detailed and informative\nrecent guide to Aristotle's Metaphysics, see Politis\n2004.) Should we assume that ‘metaphysics’ is a name for that\n“science” which is the subject-matter of\nAristotle's Metaphysics? If we assume this, we should be\ncommitted to something in the neighborhood of the following theses:  Any of these three theses might have been regarded as a defensible\nstatement of the subject-matter of what was called\n‘metaphysics’ until the seventeenth century. But then,\nrather suddenly, many topics and problems that Aristotle and the\nMedievals would have classified as belonging to physics (the relation\nof mind and body, for example, or the freedom of the will, or personal\nidentity across time) began to be reassigned to metaphysics. One might\nalmost say that in the seventeenth century metaphysics began to be a\ncatch-all category, a repository of philosophical problems that could\nnot be otherwise classified as epistemology, logic, ethics or other\nbranches of philosophy. (It was at about that time that the word\n‘ontology’ was invented—to be a name for the science\nof being as such, an office that the word ‘metaphysics’\ncould no longer fill.)  The academic rationalists of the\npost-Leibnizian school were aware that the word\n‘metaphysics’ had come to be used in a more inclusive\nsense than it had once been. Christian Wolff attempted to justify this\nmore inclusive sense of the word by this device: while the\nsubject-matter of metaphysics is being, being can be investigated\neither in general or in relation to objects in particular\ncategories. He distinguished between ‘general\nmetaphysics’ (or ontology), the study of being as such, and the\nvarious branches of ‘special metaphysics’, which study the\nbeing of objects of various special sorts, such as souls and material\nbodies. (He does not assign first causes to general\nmetaphysics, however: the study of first causes belongs to natural\ntheology, a branch of special metaphysics.) It is doubtful whether\nthis maneuver is anything more than a verbal ploy. In what sense, for\nexample, is the practitioner of rational psychology (the branch of\nspecial metaphysics devoted to the soul) engaged in a study of being?\nDo souls have a different sort of being from that of other\nobjects?—so that in studying the soul one learns not only about\nits nature (that is, its properties: rationality, immateriality,\nimmortality, its capacity or lack thereof to affect the body\n…), but also about its “mode of being”, and hence\nlearns something about being? It is certainly not true that all, or\neven very many, rational psychologists said anything, qua\nrational psychologists, that could plausibly be construed as a\ncontribution to our understanding of being. Perhaps the wider application of the word ‘metaphysics’\nwas due to the fact that the word ‘physics’ was coming to\nbe a name for a new, quantitative science, the science that bears that\nname today, and was becoming increasingly inapplicable to the\ninvestigation of many traditional philosophical problems about\nchanging things (and of some newly discovered problems about changing\nthings). Whatever the reason for the change may have been, it would be\nflying in the face of current usage (and indeed of the usage of the\nlast three or four hundred years) to stipulate that the subject-matter\nof metaphysics was to be the subject-matter of\nAristotle's Metaphysics. It would, moreover, fly in the face\nof the fact that there are and have been paradigmatic metaphysicians\nwho deny that there are first causes—this denial is certainly a\nmetaphysical thesis in the current sense—others who insist that\neverything changes (Heraclitus and any more recent philosopher who is\nboth a materialist and a nominalist), and others still (Parmenides and\nZeno) who deny that there is a special class of objects that do not\nchange. In trying to characterize metaphysics as a field, the best\nstarting point is to consider the myriad topics traditionally assigned\nto it. If metaphysics now considers a wider range of problems than those\nstudied in Aristotle's Metaphysics, those original problems\ncontinue to belong to its subject-matter. For instance, the topic of\n“being as such” (and “existence as such”, if existence is\nsomething other than being) is one of the matters that belong to\nmetaphysics on any conception of metaphysics. The following theses are\nall paradigmatically metaphysical:  It seems reasonable, moreover, to say that investigations\ninto non-being belong to the topic “being as such” and\nthus belong to metaphysics. (This did not seem reasonable to Meinong,\nwho wished to confine the subject-matter of metaphysics to “the\nactual” and who therefore did not regard his Theory of Objects\nas a metaphysical theory. According to the conception of metaphysics\nadopted in this article, however, his thesis [paraphrased]\n“Predication is independent of being” is paradigmatically\nmetaphysical.) The topics “the first causes of things” and\n“unchanging things”—have continued to interest\nmetaphysicians, though they are not now seen as having any important\nconnection with the topic “being as such”. The first three\nof Aquinas's Five Ways are metaphysical arguments on any conception of\nmetaphysics. Additionally the thesis that there are no first causes\nand the thesis that there are no things that do not change count as\nmetaphysical theses, for in the current conception of metaphysics, the\ndenial of a metaphysical thesis is a metaphysical thesis. No\npost-Medieval philosopher would say anything like this:  I study the first causes of things, and am\ntherefore a metaphysician. My colleague Dr McZed denies that there are\nany first causes and is therefore not a metaphysician; she is rather,\nan anti-metaphysician. In her view, metaphysics is a science with a\nnon-existent subject-matter, like astrology. This feature of the contemporary conception of metaphysics is\nnicely illustrated by a statement of Sartre's: I do not think myself any less a metaphysician in denying the\nexistence of God than Leibniz was in affirming it. (1949:\n139)  An anti-metaphysician in the contemporary sense\nis not a philosopher who denies that there are objects of the sorts\nthat an earlier philosopher might have said formed the subject-matter\nof metaphysics (first causes, things that do not change, universals,\nsubstances, …), but rather a philosopher who denies the\nlegitimacy of the question whether there are objects of those\nsorts.  The three original topics—the nature of being; the first\ncauses of things; things that do not change—remained topics of\ninvestigation by metaphysicians after Aristotle. Another topic,\ndiscussed in the following subsection, occupies an intermediate\nposition between Aristotle and his successors.  We human beings sort things into various classes. And we often\nsuppose that the classes into which we sort things enjoy a kind of\ninternal unity. In this respect they differ from sets in\nthe strict sense of the word. (And no doubt in others. It would seem,\nfor example, that we think of the classes we sort things\ninto—biological species, say—as comprising different\nmembers at different times.) The classes into which we sort things are\nin most cases “natural” classes, classes whose membership\nis in some important sense uniform—“kinds”. We shall not attempt\nan account or definition of ‘natural class’ here. Examples\nmust suffice. There are certainly sets whose members do not make up\nnatural classes: a set that contains all dogs but one, and a set that\ncontains all dogs and exactly one cat do not correspond to natural\nclasses in anyone's view.  And it is tempting to suppose that there is\na sense of “natural” in which dogs make up a natural\nclass, to suppose that in dividing the world into dogs and non-dogs,\nwe “cut nature at the joints”. It is, however, a\nrespectable philosophical thesis that the idea of a natural class\ncannot survive philosophical scrutiny. If that respectable thesis is\ntrue, the topic “the categories of being” is a\npseudo-topic. Let us simply assume that the respectable thesis is\nfalse and that things fall into various natural\nclasses—hereinafter, simply classes. Some of the classes into which we sort things are more\ncomprehensive than others: all dogs are animals, but not all animals\nare dogs; all animals are living organisms, but not all living\norganisms are animals …. Now the very expression “sort\nthings into classes” suggests that there is a most comprehensive\nclass: the class of things, the class of things that can be sorted\ninto classes.  But is this so?—and if it is so, are there\nclasses that are “just less comprehensive” than this\nuniversal class? If there are, can we identify them?—and are\nthere a vast (perhaps even an infinite) number of them, or some\nlargish, messy number like forty-nine, or some small, neat number like\nseven or four? Let us call any such less\ncomprehensive classes the ‘categories of being’ or the\n‘ontological categories’. (The former term, if not the latter,\npresupposes a particular position on one question about the nature of\nbeing: that everything is, that the universal class is the class of\nbeings, the class of things that are. It thus presupposes that Meinong\nwas wrong to say that “there are things of which it is true that\nthere are no such things”.) The topic “the categories of being” is intermediate\nbetween the topic “the nature of being” and the topics\nthat fall under the post-Medieval conception of metaphysics for a\nreason that can be illustrated by considering the problem of\nuniversals.  Universals, if they indeed exist, are, in the first\ninstance, properties or qualities or attributes (i.e.,\n“ductility” or “whiteness”) that are\nsupposedly universally “present in” the members of classes\nof things and relations (i.e., “being to the north of”)\nthat are supposedly universally present in the members of classes of\nsequences of things. “In the first instance”: it may be\nthat things other than qualities and relations are universals,\nalthough qualities and relations are the items most commonly put\nforward as examples of universals. It may be that the novel War\nand Peace is a universal, a thing that is in some mode present in\neach of the many tangible copies of the novel. It may be that the word\n“horse” is a universal, a thing that is present in each of\nthe many audible utterances of the word. And it may be that natural\nclasses or kinds are themselves universals—it may be that there\nis such a thing as “the horse” or the species Equus\ncaballus, distinct from its defining attribute “being a\nhorse” or “equinity”, and in some sense\n“present in” each horse. (Perhaps some difference between\nthe attribute “being a horse” and the attribute\n“being either a horse or a kitten” explains why the former\nis the defining attribute of a kind and the latter is not.  Perhaps\nthe former attribute exists and the latter does not; perhaps the\nformer has the second-order attribute “naturalness” and\nthe latter does not; perhaps the former is more easily apprehended by\nthe intellect than the latter.) The thesis that universals exist—or at any rate\n“subsist” or “have being”—is variously\ncalled ‘realism’ or ‘Platonic realism’ or\n‘platonism’. All three terms are objectionable. Aristotle\nbelieved in the reality of universals, but it would be at best an\noxymoron to call him a platonist or a Platonic realist. And\n‘realism’ tout court has served as a name for a variety of\nphilosophical theses. The thesis that universals do not exist—do\nnot so much as subsist; have no being of any sort—is generally\ncalled ‘nominalism’. This term, too is objectionable. At\none time, those who denied the existence of universals were fond of\nsaying things like:  There is no such thing as “being a horse”:\nthere is only the name [nomen, gen. nominis]\n“horse”, a mere flatus vocis [puff of\nsound]. Present-day nominalists, however,\nare aware, if earlier nominalists were not, that if the phrase\n‘the name “horse” ’ designated an\nobject, the object it designated would itself be a universal or\nsomething very like one. It would not be a mere puff of sound but\nwould rather be what was common to the many puffs of sound that were\nits tokens. The old debate between the nominalists and the realists continues\nto the present day. Most realists suppose that universals constitute\none of the categories of being. This supposition could certainly be\ndisputed without absurdity. Perhaps there is a natural\nclass of things to which all universals belong but which contains\nother things as well (and is not the class of all things). Perhaps,\nfor example, numbers and propositions are not universals, and perhaps\nnumbers and propositions and universals are all members of a class of\n“abstract objects”, a class that some things do not belong\nto. Or perhaps there is such a thing as “the whiteness of the\nTaj Mahal” and perhaps this object and the universal\n“whiteness”—but not the Taj Mahal itself—both\nbelong to the class of “properties”. Let us call such a\nclass—a proper subclass of an ontological category, a natural\nclass that is neither the class of all things nor one of the\nontological categories—an ‘ontological sub-category’. It may\nindeed be that universals make up a sub-category of being and are\nmembers of the category of being “abstract object”. But\nfew if any philosophers would suppose that universals were members of\nforty-nine sub-categories—much less of a vast number or an\ninfinity of sub-categories. Most philosophers who believe in the\nreality of universals would want to say that universals, if they do\nnot constitute an ontological category, at least constitute one of the\n“higher” sub-categories. If dogs form a natural class,\nthis class is—by the terms of our definition—an\nontological sub-category. And this class will no doubt be a subclass\nof many sub-categories: the genus canis, the class (in the\nbiological sense) mammalia, …, and so through a chain\nof sub-categories that eventually reaches some very general\nsub-category like “substance” or “material\nobject”. Thus, although dogs may compose an ontological\nsub-category, this sub-category—unlike the category\n“universal”—is one of the “lower”\nones. These reflections suggest that the topic “the categories\nof being” should be understood to comprehend both the categories\nof being sensu stricto and their immediate\nsub-categories. Does the topic “the categories of being” belong to\nmetaphysics in the “old” sense? A case can be made for\nsaying that it does, based on the fact that Plato's theory of forms\n(universals, attributes) is a recurrent theme in\nAristotle's Metaphysics. In Metaphysics, two of\nPlato's central theses about the forms come in for vigorous criticism:\n(i) that things that would, if they existed, be “inactive”\n(the forms) could be the primary beings, the “most real”\nthings, and (ii) that the attributes of things exist\n“separately” from the things whose attributes they are. We\nshall be concerned only with (ii). In the terminology of the Schools,\nthat criticism can be put this way: Plato wrongly believed that\nuniversals existed ante res (prior to objects); the correct\nview is that universals exist in rebus (in objects). It is\nbecause this aspect of the problem of universals—whether\nuniversals exist ante res or in rebus—is\ndiscussed at length in Metaphysics, that a strong case can be\nmade for saying that the problem of universals falls under the old\nconception of metaphysics. (And the question whether universals, given\nthat they exist at all, exist ante res or in rebus\nis as controversial in the twenty-first century as it was in the\nthirteenth century and the fourth century B.C.E.) If we do decide that\nthe problem of universals belongs to metaphysics on the old\nconception, then, since we have liberalized the old\nconception by applying to it the contemporary rule that\nthe denial of a metaphysical position is to be regarded as a\nmetaphysical position, we shall have to say that the question whether\nuniversals exist at all is a metaphysical question under the old\nconception—and that nominalism is therefore a metaphysical\nthesis. There is, however, also a case to made against classifying the\nproblem of universals as a problem of metaphysics in the (liberalized)\nold sense. For there is more to the problem of universals than the\nquestion whether universals exist and the question whether, if they do\nexist, their existence is ante res or in rebus. For\nexample, the problem of universals also includes questions about the\nrelation between universals (if such there be) and the things that are\nnot universals, the things usually called particulars. Aristotle did\nnot consider these questions in the Metaphysics. One might\ntherefore plausibly contend that only one part of the problem of\nuniversals (the part that pertains to the existence and nature of\nuniversals) belongs to metaphysics in the old sense. At one time, a\nphilosopher might have said,  The universal “doghood” is a thing\nthat does not change. Therefore, questions about its nature belong to\nmetaphysics, the science of things that do not change. But dogs are\nthings that change. Therefore, questions concerning the relation of\ndogs to doghood do not belong to metaphysics. But no contemporary philosopher would divide the topics that\nway—not even if he or she believed that doghood existed and was\na thing that did not change. A contemporary philosopher—if that\nphilosopher concedes that there is any problem that can properly be\ncalled “the problem of universals”—will see the\nproblem of universals as a problem properly so called, as a problem\nhaving the kind of internal unity that leads philosophers to speak of\na philosophical problem. And the same point applies to\nthe topic “the categories of being”: every philosopher who\nis willing to say that “What are the categories of being?”\nis a meaningful question will assign every aspect of that question to\nmetaphysics Let us consider some aspects of the problem of universals that\nconcern changing things. (That is, that concern particulars—for\neven if there are particulars that do not change, most of the\nparticulars that figure in discussions of the problem of universals as\nexamples are things that change.) Consider two white\nparticulars—the Taj Mahal, say, and the Washington Monument. And\nsuppose that both these particulars are white in virtue of (i.e.,\ntheir being white consists in) their bearing some one, identifiable\nrelation to the universal “whiteness”. Suppose further\nthat we are able to single out this relation by some sort of act of\nintellectual attention or abstraction, and that (having done so) we\nhave given it the name “falling under”. All white things\nand only white things fall under whiteness, and falling under\nwhiteness is what it is to be white. (We pass over many questions that\nwould have to be addressed if we were discussing the problem of\nuniversals for its own sake. For example, both blueness\nand redness are spectral color-properties, and whiteness is not. Does\nthis fact imply that “being a spectral color-property” is,\nas one might say, a second-order universal? If so, does blueness\n“fall under” this universal in the same sense as the sense\nin which a copy of Philosophical Studies falls under\nblueness?) Now what can we say about this relation, this “falling\nunder”? What is it about the two objects whiteness and the Taj\nMahal that is responsible for the fact that the latter falls under the\nformer? Is the Taj perhaps a “bundle” of universalia\nante res, and does it fall under whiteness in virtue of the fact\nthat whiteness is one of the universals that is a constituent of the\nbundle that it is? Or might it be that a particular like the Taj,\nalthough it indeed has universals as constituents, is something more\nthan its universal constituents? Might it be that the Taj has a\nconstituent that is not a universal, a “substrate”, a\nparticular that is in some sense property-less and that holds the\nuniversal constituents of the Taj together—that\n“bundles” them? (If we take that position, then we may\nwant to say, with Armstrong (1989: 94–96), that the Taj is a\n‘thick particular’ and its substrate a ‘thin\nparticular’: a thick particular being a thin particular taken\ntogether with the properties it bundles.) Or might the Taj have\nconstituents that are neither universals nor substrates? Might we have\nbeen too hasty when we defined ‘particulars’ as things\nthat are not universals? Could there perhaps be two kinds of\nnon-universals, concrete non-universals or concrete individuals (those\nwould be the particulars, thick or thin), and abstract non-universals\nor abstract individuals (‘accidents’ or\n‘tropes’ or ‘property instances’), things that\nare properties or qualities (and relations as well), things like\n“the (individual) whiteness of the Taj Mahal”? Is the Taj\nperhaps a bundle not of universals but of accidents? Or is it composed\nof a substrate and a bundle of accidents? And we cannot neglect the\npossibility that Aristotle was right and that universals exist\nonly in rebus. If that is so, we must ask what the relation\nis between the matter that composes a particular and the universals\nthat inhere in it—that inhere simultaneously in\n“this” matter and in “that” matter. The series of questions that was set out in the preceding paragraph\nwas introduced by observing that the problem of universals includes\nboth questions about the existence and nature of universals and\nquestions about how universals are related to the particulars that\nfall under them. Many of the theories that were alluded to in that\nseries of questions could be described as theories of the\n“ontological structure” of non-universals. We can contrast\nontological structure with mereological structure. A philosophical\nquestion concerns the mereological structure of an object if it is a\nquestion about the relation between that object and those of its\nconstituents that belong to the same ontological category as the\nobject. For example, the philosopher who asks whether the Taj Mahal\nhas a certain block of marble among its constituents essentially or\nonly accidentally is asking a question about the mereological\nstructure of the Taj, since the block and the building belong to the\nsame ontological category. But the philosopher who asks whether the\nTaj has “whiteness” as a constituent and the philosopher\nwho supposes that the Taj does have this property-constituent and\nasks, “What is the nature of this relation ‘constituent\nof’ that ‘whiteness’ bears to the Taj?” are\nasking questions about its ontological structure. Many philosophers have supposed that particulars fall under\nuniversals by somehow incorporating them into their ontological\nstructure. And other philosophers have supposed that the ontological\nstructure of a particular incorporates individual properties or\naccidents—and that an accident is an accident of a certain\nparticular just in virtue of being a constituent of that\nparticular. Advocates of the existence of ante res universals, and\nparticularly those who deny that these universals are constituents of\nparticulars, tend to suppose that universals\nabound—that there is not only such a universal as\nwhiteness but such a universal as “being both white and round\nand either shiny or not made of silver”. Advocates of other\ntheories of universals are almost always less liberal in the\nrange of universals whose existence they will allow. The\nadvocate of in rebus universals is unlikely to grant the\nexistence of “being both white and round and either shiny or not\nmade of silver”, even in the case in which there is an object\nthat is both white and round and either shiny or not made of silver\n(such as a non-shiny white plastic ball). The two topics “the categories of being” and “the\nontological structure of objects” are intimately related to each\nother and to the problem of universals. It is not possible to propose\na solution to the problem of universals that does not have\nimplications for the topic “the categories of\nbeing”. (Even nominalism implies that at least one popular\ncandidate for the office “ontological category” is\nnon-existent or empty.) It is certainly possible to maintain that\nthere are ontological categories that are not directly related to the\nproblem of universals (“proposition”, “state of\naffairs”, “event”, “mere\npossibile”), but any philosopher who maintains this\nwill nevertheless maintain that if there are universals they make up\nat least one of the higher ontological sub-categories. And it seems\nthat it is possible to speak of ontological structure only if one\nsupposes that there are objects of different ontological\ncategories. So whatever metaphysics comprehends, it must comprehend\nevery aspect of the problem of universals and every aspect of the\ntopics “the categories of being” and “the\nontological structure of objects”. For a recent investigation of\nthe problems that have been discussed in this section, see Lowe\n(2006). We turn now to a topic that strictly speaking belongs to “the\ncategories of being”, but which is important enough to be\ntreated separately. Some things (if they exist at all) are present only\n“in” other things: a smile, a haircut (product, not\nprocess), a hole …. Such things may be opposed to things that\nexist “in their own right”. Metaphysicians call the things\nthat exist in their own right ‘substances’. Aristotle\ncalled them ‘protai ousiai’ or “primary\nbeings”. They make up the most important of his ontological\ncategories. Several features define protai ousiai: they are\nsubjects of predication that cannot themselves be predicated of things\n(they are not universals); things exist “in” them, but\nthey do not exist “in” things (they are not accidents like\nSocrates' wisdom or his ironic smile); they have determinate\nidentities (essences). This last feature could be put this way in\ncontemporary terms: if the prote ousia x exists at a\ncertain time and the prote ousia y exists at some\nother time, it makes sense to ask whether x and y are\nthe same, are numerically identical (and the question must have a\ndeterminate answer); and the question whether a given prote\nousia would exist in some set of counterfactual circumstances\nmust likewise have an answer (at least if the circumstances are\nsufficiently determinate—if, for example, they constitute a\npossible world.  More on this in the next section). It is difficult to suppose that smiles\nor holes have this sort of determinate identity. To ask whether the\nsmile Socrates smiled today is the smile he smiled yesterday (or is\nthe smile he would have smiled if Crito had asked one of his\ncharmingly naïve questions) can only be a question about descriptive\nidentity.  Aristotle uses ‘(prote) ousia’ not\nonly as a count-noun but as a mass term. (He generally writes\n‘ousia’ without qualification when he believes\nthat the context will make it clear that he means ‘prote\nousia’.) For example, he not only asks questions like\n“Is Socrates a (prote) ousia?” and\n“What is a (prote) ousia”?, but\nquestions like “What is the (prote) ousia of\nSocrates?” and “What is\n(prote) ousia?” (Which question he is asking\nsometimes has to be inferred from the context, since there is no\nindefinite article in Greek.) In the count-noun sense of the term,\nAristotle identifies at least some (protai) ousiai\nwith ta hupokeimena or “underlying\nthings”. Socrates, for example, is a hupokeimenon in\nthat he “lies under” the in rebus universals\nunder which he falls and the accidents that inhere in\nhim. ‘To hupokeimenon’ has an approximate Latin\nequivalent in ‘substantia’, “that which\nstands under”. (Apparently, “to stand under” and\n“to lie under” are equally good metaphorical descriptions\nof the relations a thing bears to its qualities and accidents.) Owing\nboth to the close association of (protai) ousiai\nand hupokeimena in Aristotle's philosophy and to the absence\na suitable Latin equivalent of ‘ousia’\n‘substantia’ became the customary Latin\ntranslation of the count-noun\n‘(prote) ousia’.  The question whether there in fact are substances continues to be\none of the central questions of metaphysics. Several closely related\nquestions are: How, precisely, should the concept of substance be\nunderstood?; Which of the items (if any of them) among those we\nencounter in everyday life are substances?; If there are substances at\nall, how many of them are there?—is there only one as Spinoza\ncontended, or are there many as most of the rationalists supposed?;\nWhat kinds of substances are there?—are there immaterial\nsubstances, eternal substances, necessarily existent substances? It must be emphasized that there is no universally accepted and\nprecise definition of ‘substance’. Depending on how one\nunderstood the word (or the concept) one might say either that Hume\ndenied that there were any substances or that he held that the only\nsubstances (or the only substances of which we have any knowledge)\nwere impressions and ideas. It would seem, however, that most\nphilosophers who are willing to use the word ‘substance’\nat all would deny that any of the following (if they exist) are\nsubstances: The nature of being, the problem of universals, and the nature of\nsubstance have been recognized as topics that belong to\n“metaphysics” by almost everyone who has used the word. We now\nturn to topics that belong to metaphysics only in the post-Medieval\nsense. Philosophers have long recognized that there is an important\ndistinction within the class of true propositions: the distinction\nbetween those propositions that might have been false and those that\ncould not have been false (those that must be true). Compare, for\nexample, the proposition that Paris is the capital of France and the\nproposition that there is a prime between every number greater than 1\nand its double. Both are true, but the former could have been false\nand the latter could not have been false. Likewise, there is a\ndistinction to be made within the class of false propositions: between\nthose that could have been true and those that could not have been\ntrue (those that had to be false). Some Medieval philosophers supposed that the fact that true\npropositions are of the two sorts “necessarily true” and\n“contingently true” (and the corresponding fact about\nfalse propositions) showed that there were two “modes” in\nwhich a proposition could be true (or false): the mode of contingency\nand the mode of necessity—hence the term ‘modality’.\nPresent-day philosophers retain the Medieval term\n‘modality’ but now it means no more than “pertaining\nto possibility and necessity”. The types of modality of interest\nto metaphysicians fall into two camps: modality de re and\nmodality de dicto.  Modality de dicto is the modality of propositions\n(‘dictum’ means proposition, or\nclose enough). If modality were coextensive with modality de\ndicto, it would be at least a defensible position that the topic\nof modality belongs to logic rather than to metaphysics. (Indeed, the\nstudy of modal logics goes back to Aristotle's Prior\nAnalytics.) But many philosophers also think there is a second kind of\nmodality, modality de re—the modality of things. (The\nmodality of substances, certainly, and perhaps of things in other\nontological categories.) The status of modality de re is\nundeniably a metaphysical topic, and we assign it to the\n“new” metaphysics because, although one can ask modal\nquestions about things that do not change—God, for example, or\nuniversals—a large proportion of the work that has been done in\nthis area concerns the modal features of changing things. There are two types of modality de re. The first concerns\nthe existence of things—of human beings, for example. If Sally,\nan ordinary human being, says, “I might not have existed”,\nalmost everyone will take her to have stated an obvious truth. And if\nwhat she has said is indeed true, then she exists contingently. That\nis to say, she is a contingent being: a being who might not have\nexisted.  A necessary being, in contrast, is a being of which it is\nfalse that it might not have existed. Whether any objects are\nnecessary beings is an important question of modal metaphysics. Some\nphilosophers have gone so far to maintain that all objects are necessary\nbeings, since necessary existence is a truth of logic in what seems to\nthem to be the best quantified modal logic. (See Barcan 1946 for the\nfirst modern connection between necessary existence and quantified\nmodal logic. Barcan did not draw any metaphysical conclusions from her\nlogical results, but later authors, especially Williamson 2013\nhave.)  The second kind of modality de re concerns the properties\nof things.  Like the existence of things, the possession of properties\nby things is subject to modal qualification. If Sally, who speaks\nEnglish, says, “I might have spoken only French”, almost\neveryone will take that statement to be no less obviously true than\nher statement that she might not have existed. And if what she has\nsaid is indeed true, then “speaking English” is a property\nthat she has only contingently or (the more usual word) only\naccidentally.  Additionally there may be properties which some objects\nhave essentially. A thing has a property essentially if it could not\nexist without having that property. Examples of essential properties\ntend to be controversial, largely because the most\nplausible examples of a certain object's possessing a property\nessentially are only as plausible as the thesis that that object\npossesses those properties at all. For example, if Sally is a physical\nobject, as physicalists suppose, then it is very plausible for them to\nsuppose further that she is essentially a physical object—but it\nis controversial whether they are right to suppose that she is a\nphysical object. And, of course, the same thing can be\nsaid, mutatis mutandis, concerning dualists and the property\nof being a non-physical object. It would seem, however, that Sally is\neither essentially a physical object or essentially a non-physical\nobject. And many find it plausible to suppose that (whether she is\nphysical or non-physical) she has the property “not being a\npoached egg” essentially. The most able and influential enemy of modality (both de\ndicto and de re) was W. V. Quine, who vigorously\ndefended both the following theses. First, that modality de\ndicto can be understood only in terms of the concept of\nanalyticity (a problematical concept in his view).  Secondly, that\nmodality de re cannot be understood in terms of analyticity\nand therefore cannot be understood at all. Quine argued for this\nlatter claim by proposing what he took to be decisive counterexamples\nto theories that take essentiality to be meaningful. If\nmodality de re makes any sense, Quine contended (1960:\n199–200), cyclists must be regarded as essentially\nbipedal—for “Cyclists are bipedal” would be regarded\nas an analytic sentence by those who believe in analyticity. But\nmathematicians are only accidentally bipedal (“Mathematicians\nare bipedal” is not analytic by anyone's lights). What then,\nQuine proceeded to ask, of someone who is both a mathematician and a\ncyclist?—that person seems both essentially and only\naccidentally bi-pedal. Since this is incoherent, Quine thought that\nmodality de re is incoherent. Most philosophers are now convinced, however, that Quine's\n“mathematical cyclist” argument has been adequately\nanswered by Saul Kripke (1972), Alvin Plantinga (1974) and various\nother defenders of modality de re. Kripke and Plantinga's\ndefenses of modality are paradigmatically metaphysical (except insofar\nas they directly address Quine's linguistic argument). Both make\nextensive use of the concept of a possible world in defending the\nintelligibility of modality (both de re and de\ndicto). Leibniz was the first philosopher to use ‘possible\nworld’ as a philosophical term of art, but Kripke's and\nPlantinga's use of the phrase is different from his. For Leibniz, a\npossible world was a possible creation: God's act of creation consists\nin his choosing one possible world among many to be the one world that\nhe creates—the “actual” world. For Kripke and\nPlantinga, however, a possible world is a possible “whole of\nreality”. For Leibniz, God and his actions “stand\noutside” all possible worlds. For Kripke and Plantinga, no\nbeing, not even God, could stand outside the whole system of possible\nworlds. A Kripke-Plantinga (KP) world is an abstract object of some\nsort. Let us suppose that a KP world is a possible state of affairs\n(this is Plantinga's idea; Kripke says nothing so definite). Consider\nany given state of affairs; let us say, Paris being the capital of\nFrance.  This state of affairs obtains, since Paris is\nthe capital of France. By contrast, the state of affairs Tours\nbeing the capital of France does not obtain. The latter state of\naffairs does, however, exist, for there is such a state of\naffairs. (Obtaining thus stands to states of affairs as truth stands\nto propositions: although the proposition that Tours is the capital of\nFrance is not true, there nevertheless is such a proposition.) The\nstate of affairs x is said to include the state of\naffairs y if it is impossible for x to obtain\nand y not to obtain. If it is impossible for both x\nand y to obtain, then each precludes the other. A possible\nworld is simply a possible state of affairs that, for every state of\naffairs x, either includes or precludes x; the actual\nworld is the one such state of affairs that obtains. Using the KP theory we can answer Quine's challenge as follows. In\nevery possible world, every cyclist in that world is bipedal in that\nworld. (Assuming with Quine that necessarily cyclists are\nbipedal. Apparently he had not foreseen adaptive bicycles.)\nNevertheless for any particular cyclist, there is some possible world\nwhere he (the same person) is not bipedal. Once we draw this\ndistinction, we can see that Quine's argument is invalid. More\ngenerally, on the KP theory, theses about de re essential\nproperties need not be analytic; they are meaningful\nbecause they express claims about an object's properties in various\npossible worlds.  We can also use the notion of possible worlds to define many other\nmodal concepts. For example, a necessarily true proposition is a\nproposition that would be true no matter what possible world was\nactual. Socrates is a contingent being if there is some possible world\nsuch that he would not exist if that world were actual, and he has the\nproperty “being human” essentially if every possible world\nthat includes his existence also includes his being human. Kripke and\nPlantinga have greatly increased the clarity of modal discourse (and\nparticularly of modal discourse de re), but at the expense of\nintroducing a modal ontology, an ontology of possible worlds. Theirs is not the only modal ontology on offer. The main\nalternative to the KP theory has been the ‘modal realism’\nchampioned by David Lewis (1986). Lewis's modal ontology appeals to\nobjects called possible worlds, but these “worlds” are\nconcrete objects. What we call the actual world is one of these\nconcrete objects, the spatiotemporally connected universe we\ninhabit. What we call “non-actual” worlds are other\nconcrete universes that are spatiotemporally isolated from ours (and\nfrom each other). There is, Lewis contends, a vast array of non-actual\nworlds, an array that contains at least those worlds that are\ngenerated by an ingenious principle of recombination, a principle that\ncan be stated without the use of modal language (1986: 87). For Lewis,\nmoreover, “actual” is an indexical term: when I speak of\nthe actual world, I refer to the world of which I am an\ninhabitant—and so for any speaker who is “in” (who\nis a part of) any world. In the matter of modality de dicto, Lewis's theory\nproceeds in a manner that is at least parallel to the KP theory: there\ncould be flying pigs if there are flying pigs in some possible world\n(if some world has flying pigs as parts). But the case is otherwise\nwith modality de re. Since every ordinary object is in only\none of the concrete worlds, Lewis must either say that each such\nobject has all its properties essentially or else adopt a treatment of\nmodality de re that is not parallel to the KP treatment. He\nchooses the latter alternative. Although Socrates is in only the\nactual world, Lewis holds, he has ‘counterparts’ in some\nother worlds, objects that play the role in those worlds that he plays\nin this world. If all Socrates' counterparts are human, then we may\nsay that he is essentially human. If one of Hubert Humphrey's\ncounterparts won (the counterpart of) the 1968 presidential election,\nit is correct to say of Humphrey that he could have won that\nelection. In addition to the obvious stark ontological contrast between the\ntwo theories, they differ in two important ways in their implications\nfor the philosophy of modality. First, if Lewis is right, then modal\nconcepts can be defined in terms of paradigmatically non-modal\nconcepts, since ‘world’ and all of Lewis's other technical\nterms can be defined using only ‘is spatiotemporally related\nto’, ‘is a part of’ and the vocabulary of set\ntheory. For Kripke and Plantinga, however, modal concepts are sui\ngeneris, indefinable or having only definitions that appeal to\nother modal concepts. Secondly, Lewis's theory implies a kind of\nanti-realism concerning modality de re. This is because there\nis no one relation that is the counterpart relation—there are\nrather various ways or respects in which one could say that objects in\ntwo worlds “play the same role” in their respective\nworlds. Socrates, therefore, may well have non-human counterparts\nunder one counterpart relation and no non-human\ncounterparts under another. And the choice of a counterpart relation\nis a pragmatic or interest-relative choice. But on the KP theory, it\nis an entirely objective question whether Socrates fails to be human\nin some world in which he exists: the answer must be Yes or No and is\nindependent of human choices and interests. Whatever one may think of these theories when one considers them\nin their own right (as theories of modality, as theories\nwith various perhaps objectionable ontological commitments), one must\nconcede that they are paradigmatically metaphysical theories. They\nbear witness to the resurgence of metaphysics in\nanalytical philosophy in the last third of the twentieth century. Long before the theory of relativity represented space and\ntime as aspects of or abstractions from a single entity, spacetime,\nphilosophers saw space and time as intimately related. (A glance\nthrough any dictionary of quotations suggests that the philosophical\npairing of space and time reflects a natural, pre-philosophical\ntendency: “Had we but world enough, and time …”;\n“Dwellers all in time and space”.) Kant, for example,\ntreated space and time in his Transcendental Aesthetic as\nthings that should be explained by a single, unified theory. And his\ntheory of space and time, revolutionary though it may have been in\nother respects, was in this respect typical of philosophical accounts\nof space and time. Whatever the source of the conviction that space\nand time are two members of a “species” (and the only two\nmembers of that species), they certainly raise similar philosophical\nquestions. It can be asked whether space extends infinitely in every\ndirection, and it can be asked whether time extends infinitely in\neither of the two temporal “directions”. Just as one can\nask whether, if space is finite, it has an “end” (whether\nit is bounded or unbounded), one may ask of time whether, if it is\nfinite, it had a beginning or will have an end or whether it might\nhave neither, but rather be “circular” (be finite but\nunbounded). As one can ask whether there could be two extended objects\nthat were not spatially related to each other, one can ask whether\nthere could be two events that were not temporally related to each\nother. One can ask whether space is (a) a real thing—a\nsubstance—a thing that exists independently of its\ninhabitants, or (b) a mere system of\nrelations among those inhabitants. And one can ask the same\nquestion about time.  But there are also questions about time that have no spatial\nanalogues—or at least no obvious and uncontroversial\nanalogues. There are, for example, questions about the grounds of\nvarious asymmetries between the past and the future—why is our\nknowledge of the past better than our knowledge of the future?; why do\nwe regard an unpleasant event that is about to happen differently from\nthe way we regard an unpleasant event that has recently happened?; why\ndoes causation seem to have a privileged temporal direction? There do\nnot seem to be objective asymmetries like this in space. There is also the question of temporal passage—the question\nwhether the apparent “movement” of time (or the apparent\nmovement of ourselves and the objects of our experience through or in\ntime) is a real feature of the world or some sort of illusion. In one\nway of thinking about time, there is a privileged temporal direction\nmarking the difference between the past, present, and\nfuture. A-theorists hold that time is fundamentally structured in\nterms of a past/present/future distinction. Times change from past to\npresent to future, giving rise to passage. (The name\n‘A-theorist’ descends from J.M.E. McTaggart's (1908) name\nfor the sequence past/present/future which he called the\n‘A-series’.) Within the A-theory, we might further ask\nwhether the past and future have the “same sort of\nreality” as the present. Presentist A-theorists, like Prior\n1998, deny that the past or future have any concrete reality.\nPresentists typically think of the past and future as, at best, akin\nto abstract possible worlds—they are the way the world was or will\nbe, just as possible worlds are ways the actual world could be. Other\nA-theorists, like Sullivan (2012), hold that the present is\nmetaphysically privileged but deny that there is any ontological\ndifference between the past, present, and future. More generally,\nA-theorists often incorporate strategies from modal metaphysics into\ntheir theories about the relation of the past and the future to the\npresent.  According to B-theories of time, the only fundamental distinction we\nshould draw is that some events and times are earlier or later\nrelative to others. (These relations are called\n‘B-relations’, a term also derived from McTaggart). According\nto the B-theorists, there is no objective passage of time, or at least\nnot in the sense of time passing from future to present and from\npresent to past.  B-theorists typically maintain that all past and\nfuture times are real in the same sense in which the present time is\nreal—the present is in no sense metaphysically privileged.  It is also true, and less often remarked on, that space raises\nphilosophical questions that have no temporal analogues—or at\nleast no obvious and uncontroversial analogues. Why, for example, does\nspace have three dimensions and not four or seven? On the face of it,\ntime is essentially one-dimensional and space is not essentially\nthree-dimensional. It also seems that the metaphysical problems about\nspace that have no temporal analogues depend on the fact that space,\nunlike time, has more than one dimension. For example, consider the\nproblem of incongruent counterparts: those who think space is a mere\nsystem of relations struggled to explain our intuition that we could\ndistinguish a world containing only a left hand from a world\ncontaining only a right hand. So it seems there is an intuitive\norientation to objects in space itself. It is less clear whether the\nproblems about time that have no spatial analogues are connected with\nthe one-dimensionality of time. Finally, one can raise questions about whether space and time are\nreal at all—and, if they are real, to what extent (so to speak)\nthey are real. Might it be that space and time are not constituents of\nreality as God perceives reality but nevertheless “well-founded\nphenomena” (as Leibniz held)? Was Kant right when he denied\nspatial and temporal features to “things as they are in\nthemselves”?—and right to contend that space and time are\n“forms of our intuition”? Or was McTaggart's position the\nright one: that space and time are wholly unreal? If these problems about space and time belong to metaphysics only\nin the post-Medieval sense, they are nevertheless closely related to\nquestions about first causes and universals. First causes are\ngenerally thought by those who believe in them to be eternal and\nnon-local. God, for example—both the impersonal God of Aristotle\nand the personal God of Medieval Christian, Jewish, and Muslim\nphilosophy—is generally said to be eternal, and the personal God\nis said to be omnipresent. To say that God is eternal is to say either\nthat he is everlasting or that he is somehow outside time. And this\nraises the metaphysical question of whether it is possible for there to\nbe a being—not a universal or an abstract object of some other\nsort, but an active substance—that is everlasting or\nnon-temporal. An omnipresent being is a being that does not occupy any\nregion of space (not even the whole of it, as the luminiferous ether\nof nineteenth-century physics would if it existed), and whose causal\ninfluence is nevertheless equally present in every region of space\n(unlike universals, to which the concept of causality does not\napply). The doctrine of divine omnipresence raises the metaphysical\nquestion whether it is possible for there to be a being with this\nfeature. Ante res universals are said by some of their\nproponents (precisely those who deny that universals are constituents\nof particulars) to have no relations to space and time but\n“vicarious” ones: the ante res universal\n“whiteness” may be said to be present where each white\nparticular is, but only in a way analogous to the way in which the\nnumber two is present where each pair of spatial things is.  But it is\ndoubtful whether this is a position that is possible for a\nmetaphysician who says that a white thing is a bundle composed of\nwhiteness and various other universals. Those who believe in the\nexistence of in rebus universals are fond of saying, or have\nbeen in recent years, that these universals (‘immanent\nuniversals’ is a currently popular name for them) are\n“multiply located”—“wholly present” at\neach place at which the things that fall under them are present. And\nby this they certainly do not mean that whiteness is present in many\ndifferent regions of space only vicariously, only as a number might be\nsaid to be present wherever there are things in that number, only in\nvirtue of bearing the non-spatial relation “being had by”\nto a multitude of particulars each of which is present in a single\nregion of space. All theories of universals, therefore, raise\nquestions about how things in various ontological categories are\nrelated to space. And all these questions have temporal analogues. Related to questions about the nature of space and time are\nquestions about the nature of objects that take up space or persist\nthrough time, and these questions form yet another central theme in\npost-medieval metaphysics. Are some or all objects composed of proper\nparts? Must an object have proper parts in order to “fill\nup” a region of space—or are there extended simples? Can\nmore that one object be located in exactly the same region? Do objects\npersist through change by having temporal parts? Much work on persistence and constitution has focused on efforts to\naddress a closely knit family of puzzles—the puzzles of\ncoincidence. One such puzzle is the “problem of the statue and\nthe lump”. Consider a gold statue. Many metaphysicians contend\nthat there is at least one material object that is spatially\nco-extensive with the statue, a lump of gold. This is\neasily shown, they say, by an appeal to Leibniz's Law (the principle\nof the non-identity of discernibles). There is a statue here and there\nis a lump of gold here, and—if the causal story of the statue's\ncoming to be is of the usual sort—the lump of gold existed\nbefore the statue. And even if God has created the statue (and\nperforce the lump) ex nihilo and will at some point\nannihilate the statue (and thereby annihilate the lump), they further\nargue, the statue and the lump, although they exist at exactly the\nsame times, have different modal properties: the lump has the property\n“can survive radical deformation” and the statue does\nnot. Or so these metaphysicians conclude. But it has seemed to other\nmetaphysicians that this conclusion is absurd, for it is absurd to\nsuppose (these others say) that there could be spatially coincident\nphysical objects that share all their momentary\nnon-modal properties. Hence, the problem: What, if anything, is the\nflaw in the argument for the non-identity of the statue and the\nlump?  A second puzzle in this family is the “problem of Tib and\nTibbles”. Tibbles is a cat. Call his tail “Tail”.\nCall all of him but his tail “Tib”. Suppose Tail is cut\noff—or, better, annihilated. Tibbles still exists, for a cat can\nsurvive the loss of its tail. And it would seem that Tib will exist\nafter the “loss” of Tail, because Tib lost no part. But\nwhat will be the relation between Tib and Tibbles? Can it be identity?\nNo, that is ruled out by the non-identity of discernibles, for Tibbles\nwill have become smaller and Tib will remain the same size. But then,\nonce again, we seem to have a case of spatially coincident material\nobjects that share their momentary non-modal properties. Both these constitution problems turn on questions about the\nidentities of spatially coincident objects—and, indeed, of\nobjects that share all their (proper) parts. (A third famous problem\nof material constitution—the problem of the Ship of\nTheseus—raises questions of a different sort.) Some\nmetaphysicians contend that the relation between the lump and the\nstatue, on the one hand, and the relation between Tib and Tibbles, on\nthe other, cannot be fully understood in terms of the concepts of\nparthood and (non-) identity, but require a further concept, a\nnon-mereological concept, the concept of “constitution”:\nthe pre-existent lump at a certain point in time comes to constitute\nthe statue (or a certain quantity of gold or certain gold atoms that\nfirst constituted only the lump come to constitute them both);\npre-existent Tib at a certain point in time comes to constitute\nTibbles (or certain cat-flesh or certain molecules …).  (Baker\n2000 is a defense of this thesis.) Others contend that all the\nrelations between the objects that figure in both problems can be\nfully analyzed in terms of parthood and identity. For a more thorough\noverview of the solutions to these puzzles and different theories of\nconstitution in play, see Rea (ed.) 1997 and Thomson 1998.  Questions about causation form yet a fourth important category of\nissues in the “new” metaphysics. Of course, discussion of\ncauses go back to Ancient Philosophy, featuring prominently in\nAristotle's Metaphysics and Physics. But Aristotle understood\n‘cause’ in a much broader sense than we do today. In Aristotle's\nsense, a ‘cause’ or ‘aiton’ is an explanatory condition of an\nobject—an answer to a “why” question about the\nobject. Aristotle classifies four such explanatory conditions—an\nobject's form, matter, efficient cause, and teleology. An object's\nefficient cause is the cause which explains change or motion in an\nobject. With the rise of modern physics in the seventeenth century,\ninterest in efficient causal relations became acute, and it remains so\ntoday. And when contemporary philosophers discuss problems of\ncausation, they typically mean this sense.  One major issue in the metaphysics of causation concerns\nspecifying the relata of causal relations.  Consider a\nmundane claim: an iceberg caused the Titanic to sink.  Does the causal\nrelation hold between two events: the event of the ship hitting the\niceberg and the event of the ship sinking? Or does it hold between two\nsets of states of affairs? Or does it hold between two substances, the\niceberg and the ship? Must causal relations be triadic or otherwise\npoly-adic? For example, one might think that we are always required to\nqualify a causal claim: the iceberg, rather than the captain's\nnegligence, was causally responsible for the ships foundering. And can\nabsences feature in causal relations? For example, does it make sense\nto claim that a lack of lifeboats was the cause of a third class\npassenger's death?  We might further ask whether causal relations are objective and\nirreducible features of reality. Hume famously doubted this,\ntheorizing that that our observations of causation were nothing more\nthan observations of constant conjunction. For example, perhaps we\nthink icebergs cause ships to sink only because we always observe\nship-sinking events occurring after iceberg-hitting events and not\nbecause there is a real causal relation that holds between icebergs\nand foundering ships. Contemporary metaphysicians have been attracted to other kinds of\nreductive treatments of causation. Some—like Stalnaker and\nLewis—have argued that causal relations should be understood in\nterms of counterfactual dependencies (Stalnaker 1968 and Lewis\n1973). For example, an iceberg's striking the ship caused its sinking\nat time t if and only if in the nearest possible worlds where\nthe iceberg did not strike the ship at time t, the ship did not\nsink. Others have argued that causal relations should be understood in\nterms of instantiations of laws of nature. (Davidson (1967) and\nArmstrong (1997) each defend this view albeit in different ways.) All\nof these theories expand on an idea from Hume's Treatise in\nattempting to reduce causation to different or more fundamental\ncategories. (For a more complete survey of recent theories of\ncausation, see Paul and Hall 2013.)  Debates about causation and laws of nature further give rise to a\nrelated set of pressing philosophical questions—questions of\nfreedom. In the seventeenth century, celestial mechanics gave\nphilosophers a certain picture of a way the world might be: it might\nbe a world whose future states were entirely determined by the past\nand the laws of nature (of which Newton's laws of motion and law of\nuniversal gravitation served as paradigms).  In the nineteenth century\nthe thesis that the world was indeed this way came to be called\n‘determinism’. The problem of free will can be stated as a\ndilemma. If determinism is true, there is only one physically possible\nfuture. But then how can anyone ever have acted otherwise? For, as\nCarl Ginet has said (1990: 103), our freedom can only be the freedom\nto add to the actual past; and if determinism holds, then there is\nonly one way that the given—the actual—past can be\n“added to”. But if determinism does not hold, if there are\nalternative physically possible futures, then which one comes to pass\nmust be a mere matter of chance. And if it is a mere matter of chance\nwhether I lie or tell the truth, how can it be “up to me”\nwhether I lie or tell the truth? Unless there is something wrong with\none of these two arguments, the argument for the incompatibility of\nfree will and determinism or the argument for the incompatibility of\nfree will and the falsity of determinism, free will is impossible. The\nproblem of free will may be identified with the problem of discovering\nwhether free will is possible—and, if free will is possible, the\nproblem of giving an account of free will that displays an error in\none of (or both) these arguments.  Van Inwagen (1998) defends the position that, although\nthe modern problem of free will has its origin in philosophical\nreflections on the consequences of supposing the physical universe to\nbe governed by deterministic laws, the problem cannot be evaded by\nembracing a metaphysic (like dualism or idealism) that supposes that\nagents are immaterial or non-physical. This leads into our next and\nfinal sample of topics from the “new” metaphysics.  If it is natural both to pair and to oppose time and space, it is\nalso natural to pair and to oppose the mental and the physical. The\nmodern identity theory holds that all mental events or states are a\nspecial sort of physical event or state. The theory is parsimonious\n(among its other virtues) but we nevertheless exhibit a natural\ntendency to distinguish the mental and the physical. Perhaps the\nreason for this is epistemological: whether our thoughts and\nsensations are physical or not, the kind of awareness we have of them\nis of a radically different sort from the kind of awareness we have of\nthe flight of a bird or of a flowing stream, and it seems to be\nnatural to infer that the objects of the one sort of awareness are\nradically different from the objects of the other. That the inference\nis logically invalid is (as is so often the case) no barrier to its\nbeing made. Whatever the reason may be, philosophers have generally\n(but not universally) supposed that the world of concrete particulars\ncan be divided into two very different realms, the mental and the\nmaterial. (As the twentieth century passed and physical theory\nrendered “matter” an increasingly problematical concept,\nit became increasingly common to say “the mental and the\nphysical”.) If one takes this view of things, one faces\nphilosophical problems that modern philosophy has assigned to\nmetaphysics.  Prominent among these is the problem of accounting for mental\ncausation. If thoughts and sensations belong to an immaterial or\nnon-physical portion of reality—if, for example, they are\nchanges in immaterial or non-physical substances—how can they\nhave effects in the physical world?  How, for example, can a decision\nor act of will cause a movement of a human body? How, for that matter,\ncan changes in the physical world have effects in the non-physical\npart of reality? If one's feeling pain is a non-physical event, how\ncan a physical injury to one's body cause one to feel pain? Both\nquestions have troubled “two realm” philosophers—or\n‘dualists’, to give them their more usual name. But the former has\ntroubled them more, since modern physics is founded on principles that\nassert the conservation of various physical quantities. If a\nnon-physical event causes a change in the physical\nworld—dualists are repeatedly asked—does that not imply\nthat physical quantities like energy or momentum fail to be conserved\nin any physically closed causal system in which that change occurs?\nAnd does that not imply that every voluntary movement of a human body\ninvolves a violation of the laws of physics—that is to say, a\nmiracle?  A wide range of metaphysical theories have been generated by the\nattempts of dualists to answer these questions. Some have been less\nthan successful for reasons that are not of much intrinsic\nphilosophical interest. C. D.  Broad, for example, proposed (1925:\n103–113) that the mind affects the body by momentarily changing\nthe electrical resistance of certain synapses in the brain, (thus\ndiverting various current pulses, which literally follow the\npath of least resistance into paths other than those they\nwould have taken). And this, he supposed, would not imply a violation\nof the principle of the conservation of energy. But it seems\nimpossible to suppose that an agent could change the electrical\nresistance of a physical system without expending energy in the\nprocess, for to do this would necessitate changing the physical\nstructure of the system, and that implies changing the positions of\nbits of matter on which forces are acting (think of turning the knob\non a rheostat or variable resistor: one must expend energy to do\nthis). If this example has any philosophical interest it is this: it\nillustrates the fact that it is impossible to imagine a way for a\nnon-physical thing to affect the behavior of a (classical) physical\nsystem without violating a conservation principle.  The various dualistic theories of the mind treat the\ninteraction problem in different ways. The theory called\n‘dualistic interactionism’ does not, of itself, have\nanything to say about the problem—although its various\nproponents (Broad, for example) have proposed solutions to\nit. ‘Occasionalism’ simply concedes that the “local”\ncounterfactual dependence of the behavior of a physical system on a\nnon-physical event requires a miracle. The theory of pre-established\nharmony, which substitutes “global” for local\ncounterfactual dependence of voluntary physical movements on the\nmental states of agents, avoids problems with conservation\nprinciples—but secures this advantage at a great price. (Like\noccasionalism, it presupposes theism, and, unlike occasionalism, it\nentails either that free will does not exist or that free will is\ncompatible with determinism.) ‘Epiphenomenalism’ simply denies that the\nmental can affect the physical, and contents itself with an\nexplanation of why the mental appears to affect the physical.  In addition to these dualistic theories, there are monistic\ntheories, theories that dissolve the interaction problem by denying\nthe existence of either the physical or the non-physical: idealism and\nphysicalism.  (Present-day philosophers for the most part prefer the\nterm ‘physicalism’ to the older term\n‘materialism’ for reasons noted above.) Most current work\nin the philosophy of mind presupposes physicalism, and it is generally\nagreed that a physicalistic theory that does not simply deny the\nreality of the mental (that is not an “eliminativist”\ntheory), raises metaphysical questions. Such a theory must, of course,\nfind a place for the mental in a wholly physical world, and such a\nplace exists only if mental events and states are certain special\nphysical events and states. There are at least three important\nmetaphysical questions raised by these theories. First, granted that\nall particular mental events or states are identical with particular\nphysical events or states, can it also be that some or all mental\nuniversals (‘event-types’ and ‘state-types’\nare the usual terms) are identical with physical universals? Secondly,\ndoes physicalism imply that mental events and states cannot really be\ncauses (does physicalism imply a kind of epiphenomenalism)? Thirdly,\ncan a physical thing have non-physical properties—might it be\nthat mental properties like “thinking of Vienna” or\n“perceiving redly” are non-physical properties of physical\norganisms? This last question, of course, raises a more basic\nmetaphysical question, ‘What is a non-physical property?’\nAnd all forms of the identity theory raise fundamental metaphysical\nquestions, ontological questions, questions like, ‘What is an\nevent?’ and ‘What is a state?’.  As is obvious from the discussion\nin Section 3, the scope of metaphysics has\nexpanded beyond the tidy boundaries Aristotle drew. So how should we\nanswer our original question? Is contemporary metaphysics just a\ncompendium of philosophical problems that cannot be assigned to\nepistemology or logic or ethics or aesthetics or to any of the parts\nof philosophy that have relatively clear definitions? Or is there a\ncommon theme that unites work on these disparate problems and\ndistinguishes contemporary metaphysics from other areas of\ninquiry?   These issues concerning the nature of metaphysics are further\nconnected with issues about the epistemic status of various\nmetaphysical theories. Aristotle and most of the Medievals took it for\ngranted that, at least in its most fundamental aspects, the ordinary\nperson's picture of the world is “correct as far as it\ngoes”. But many post-Medieval metaphysicians have refused to\ntake this for granted. Some of them, in fact, have been willing to\ndefend the thesis that the world is very different from, perhaps\nradically different from, the way people thought it was before they\nbegan to reason philosophically. For example, in response to the\npuzzles of coincidence considered in Section\n3.3, some metaphysicians have maintained that there are no objects\nwith proper parts. This entails that composite objects—tables,\nchairs, cats, and so on—do not exist, a somewhat startling\nview. And as we saw in Section 3.1, other\nmetaphysicians have been happy to postulate the reality of concrete\nmerely possible worlds if this posit makes for a simpler and more\nexplanatorily powerful theory of modality. Perhaps this contemporary\nopenness to “revisionary” metaphysics is simply a recovery\nof or a reversion to a pre-Aristotelian conception of a\n“permissible metaphysical conclusion”, a conception that\nis illustrated by Zeno's arguments against the reality of motion and\nPlato's Allegory of the Cave. But no matter how we classify it, the\nsurprising nature of many contemporary metaphysical claims puts\nadditional pressure on practioners to explain just what they are up\nto. They raise questions of the methodology of metaphysics.  One attractive strategy for answering these questions emphasizes\nthe continuity of metaphysics with science.  On this conception,\nmetaphysics is primarily or exclusively concerned with developing\ngeneralizations from our best-confirmed scientific theories. For\nexample, in the mid-twentieth century, Quine (1948) proposed that that\nthe “old/intermediate” metaphysical debate over the status\nof abstract objects should be settled in this way. He observed that if\nour best scientific theories are recast in the “canonical\nnotation of (first-order) quantification” (in sufficient depth\nthat all the inferences that users of these theories will want to make\nare valid in first-order logic), then many of these theories, if not\nall of them, will have as a logical consequence the existential\ngeneralization on a predicate \\(F\\) such that \\(F\\) is satisfied only by\nabstract objects. It would seem, therefore, that our best scientific\ntheories “carry ontological commitment” to objects whose\nexistence is denied by nominalism.  (These objects may not be\nuniversals in the classical sense. They may, for example, be sets.)\nTake for example the simple theory, ‘There are homogeneous\nobjects, and the mass of a homogeneous object in grams is the product\nof its density in grams per cubic centimeter and its volume in cubic\ncentimeters’. A typical recasting of this theory\nin the canonical notation of quantification is: (‘\\(Hx\\)’: ‘\\(x\\) is homogeneous’;\n‘\\(Mx\\)’: ‘the mass of \\(x\\) in grams’;\n‘\\(Dx\\)’: ‘the density of \\(x\\) in grams per cubic\ncentimeter’; ‘\\(Vx\\)’: ‘the volume of \\(x\\) in\ncubic centimeters’.) A first-order logical consequence of this\n“theory” is That is: there exists at least one thing that is a product (at\nleast one thing that, for some \\(x\\) and some \\(y\\) is the product of \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\)). And a product must be a number, for the\noperation “product of” applies only to numbers. Our little\ntheory, at least if it is recast in the way shown above,\nis therefore, in a very obvious sense, “committed” to the\nexistence of numbers. It would seem, therefore, that a nominalist\ncannot consistently affirm that theory. (In this example, the role\nplayed by ‘the predicate F’ in the abstract\nstatement of Quine's “observation” is played by the\npredicate ‘…=…×…’.) Quine's work on nominalism inspired a much broader program for\napproaching ontological questions. According to\n“neo-Quineans”, questions about the existence of abstract\nobjects, mental events, objects with proper parts, temporal parts, and\neven other concrete possible worlds are united to the extent that they\nare questions about the ontological machinery required to account for\nthe truth of our best-confirmed theories. Still, many questions of the\nnew and old metaphysics are not questions of ontology. For example,\nmany participants in the debate over causation are not particularly\nworried about whether causes and effects exist. Rather, they want to\nknow “in virtue of what” something is a cause or\neffect. Few involved in the debate over the mental and physical are\ninterested in the question whether there are mental properties (in\nsome sense or other).  Rather, they are interested in whether mental\nproperties are “basic” or sui generis—or\nwhether they are grounded, partially or fully, in physical\nproperties.  Is there a unified methodology for metaphysics more broadly\nunderstood? Some think the task of the metaphysician is to identify\nand argue for explanatory relations of various kinds. According to\nFine (2001), metaphysicians are in the business of providing theories\nof which facts or propositions ground other facts or propositions, and\nwhich facts or propositions hold “in reality”. For\nexample, a philosopher might hold that tables and other composite\nobjects exist, but think that facts about tables are completely\ngrounded in facts about the arrangements of point particles or facts\nabout the state of a wave function. This metaphysician would hold that\nthere are no facts about tables “in reality”; rather, there are\nfacts about arrangements of particles.  Schaffer 2010 proposes a\nsimilar view, but holds that metaphysical grounding relations hold not\nbetween facts but between entities.  According to Schaffer, the\nfundamental entity/entities should be understood as the\nentity/entities that grounds/ground all others.  On Schaffer's\nconception we can meaningfully ask whether a table is grounded in its\nparts or vice versa. We can even theorize (as Schaffer does) that the\nworld as a whole is the ultimate ground for everything.  Another noteworthy approach (Sider 2012) holds that the task of the\nmetaphysician is to “explain the world” in terms of its\nfundamental structure. For Sider, what unites (good) metaphysics as a\ndiscipline is that its theories are all framed in terms that pick out\nthe fundamental structure of the world. For example, according to\nSider we may understand ‘causal nihilism’ as the view that\ncausal relations do not feature in the fundamental structure of the\nworld, and so the best language for describing the world will eschew\ncausal predicates.  It should be emphasized that these ways of delimiting metaphysics\ndo not presuppose that all of the topics we've considered as examples\nof metaphysics are substantive or important to the subject. Consider\nthe debate about modality. Quine (1953) and Sider (2012) both argue\nfrom their respective theories about the nature of metaphysics that\naspects of the debate over the correct metaphysical theory of\nmodality are misguided. Others are skeptical of the debates about\ncomposition or persistence through time. So theories about the nature\nof metaphysics might give us new resources for criticizing particular\nfirst-order debates that have historically been considered\nmetaphysical, and it is common practice for metaphysicians to regard\nsome debates as substantive while adopting a deflationist attitude\nabout others.  It may also be that there is no internal unity to metaphysics.\nMore strongly, perhaps there is no such thing as metaphysics—or\nat least nothing that deserves to be called a science or a study or a\ndiscipline.  Perhaps, as some philosophers have proposed, no\nmetaphysical statement or theory is either true or false. Or perhaps,\nas others have proposed, metaphysical theories have truth-values, but\nit is impossible to find out what they are. At least since the time of\nHume, there have been philosophers who have proposed that metaphysics\nis “impossible”—either because its questions are\nmeaningless or because they are impossible to answer. The remainder of\nthis entry will be a discussion of some recent arguments for the\nimpossibility of metaphysics. Let us suppose that we are confident that we are able to identify\nevery statement as either “a metaphysical statement” or\n“not a metaphysical statement”. (We need not suppose that\nthis ability is grounded in some non-trivial definition or account of\nmetaphysics.) Let us call the thesis that all metaphysical statements\nare meaningless “the strong form” of the thesis that\nmetaphysics is impossible. (At one time, an enemy of metaphysics might\nhave been content to say that all metaphysical statements were false.\nBut this is obviously not a possible thesis if the denial of a\nmetaphysical statement must itself be a metaphysical statement) And\nlet us call the following statement the “weak form” of the\nthesis that metaphysics is impossible: metaphysical statements are\nmeaningful, but human beings can never discover whether any\nmetaphysical statement is true or false (or probable or improbable or\nwarranted or unwarranted).  Let us briefly examine an example of the strong form of the thesis\nthat metaphysics is impossible. The logical positivists maintained\nthat the meaning of a (non-analytic) statement consisted entirely in\nthe predictions it made about possible experience. They maintained,\nfurther, that metaphysical statements (which were obviously not put\nforward as analytic truths) made no predictions about\nexperience. Therefore, they concluded, metaphysical statements are\nmeaningless—or, better, the “statements” we classify\nas metaphysical are not really statements at all: they are things that\nlook like statements but aren't, rather as mannequins are things that\nlook like human beings but aren't.  But (many philosophers asked) how does the logical positivist's\ncentral thesis fare by its own standards? Does this thesis make any predictions\nabout possible experiences? Could some observation show that it was\ntrue? Could some experiment show that it was false? It would seem not.\nIt would seem that everything in the world would look the\nsame—like this—whether this thesis was true or\nfalse. (Will the positivist reply that the offset sentence is\nanalytic? This reply is problematic in that it implies that the\nmultitude of native speakers of English who reject the logical\npositivists' account of meaning somehow cannot see that that sentence\nis true in virtue of the meaning of the word\n“meaning”—which is no technical term but a word of\nordinary English.) And, therefore, if the statement is true it is\nmeaningless; or, what is the same thing, if it is meaningful, it is\nfalse. Logical positivism would therefore seem to say of itself that\nit is false or meaningless; it would be seem to be, to use a currently\nfashionable phrase, “self-referentially incoherent”.  Current advocates of ‘metaphysical anti-realism’ also\nadvocate a strong form of the thesis that metaphysics is\nimpossible. Insofar as it is possible to find a coherent line of\nargument in the writings of any anti-realist, it is hard to see why\nthey, like the logical positivists, are not open to a charge of\nself-referential incoherency. Indeed, there is much to be said for the\nconclusion that all forms of the strong thesis fall prey to\nself-referential incoherency. Put very abstractly, the case against\nproponents of the strong thesis may be put like this.  Dr. McZed, a\n“strong anti-metaphysician”, contends that any piece of\ntext that does not pass some test she specifies is meaningless (if she\nis typical of strong anti-metaphysicians, she will say that any text\nthat fails the test represents an attempt to use language in a way in\nwhich language cannot be used). And she contends further that any\npiece of text that can plausibly be identified as\n“metaphysical” must fail this test. But it invariably\nturns out that various sentences that are essential components of\nMcZed's case against metaphysics themselves fail to pass her test. A\ntest-case for this very schematic and abstract refutation of all\nrefutations of metaphysics is the very sophisticated and subtle\ncritique of metaphysics (it purports to apply only to the kind of\nmetaphysics exemplified by the seventeenth-century rationalists and\ncurrent analytical metaphysics) presented in van Fraassen 2002. It\nis a defensible position that van Fraassen's case against metaphysics\ndepends essentially on certain theses that, although they are not\nthemselves metaphysical theses, are nevertheless open to many of the\ncriticisms he brings against metaphysical theses.  The weak form of the thesis that metaphysics is impossible is\nthis: there is something about the human mind (perhaps even the minds\nof all rational agents or all finite rational agents) that unfits it\nfor reaching metaphysical conclusions in any reliable way. This idea\nis at least as old as Kant, but a version of it that is much more\nmodest than Kant's (and much easier to understand) has been carefully\npresented in McGinn 1993. McGinn's argument for the conclusion that\nthe human mind is (as a matter of evolutionary contingency, and not\nsimply because it is “a mind”) incapable of a satisfactory\ntreatment of a large range of philosophical questions (a range that\nincludes all metaphysical questions), however, depends on speculative\nfactual theses about human cognitive capacities that are in principle\nsubject to empirical refutation and which are at present without\nsignificant empirical support.

Ancient and Medieval\nphilosophers might have said that metaphysics was, like chemistry or\nastrology, to be defined by its subject-matter: metaphysics was the\n“science” that studied “being as such” or\n“the first causes of things” or “things that do not\nchange”. It is no longer possible to define metaphysics that\nway, for two reasons. First, a philosopher who denied the existence of\nthose things that had once been seen as constituting the\nsubject-matter of metaphysics—first causes or unchanging\nthings—would now be considered to be making thereby a\nmetaphysical assertion. Second, there are many philosophical\nproblems that are now considered to be metaphysical problems (or at\nleast partly metaphysical problems) that are in no way related to\nfirst causes or unchanging things—the problem of free will, for\nexample, or the problem of the mental and the physical.\n\nThe first three sections of this entry examine a broad selection of\nproblems considered to be metaphysical and discuss ways in which the\npurview of metaphysics has expanded over time. We shall see that the\ncentral problems of metaphysics were significantly more unified in the\nAncient and Medieval eras. Which raises a question—is there any\ncommon feature that unites the problems of contemporary metaphysics?\nThe final two sections discuss some recent theories of the nature and\nmethodology of metaphysics. We will also consider arguments that\nmetaphysics, however defined, is an impossible enterprise.\n\nThe word ‘metaphysics’ is notoriously hard to define.\nTwentieth-century coinages like ‘meta-language’ and\n‘metaphilosophy’ encourage the impression that metaphysics\nis a study that somehow “goes beyond” physics, a study\ndevoted to matters that transcend the mundane concerns of Newton and\nEinstein and Heisenberg. This impression is mistaken. The word\n‘metaphysics’ is derived from a collective title of the\nfourteen books by Aristotle that we currently think of as making up\nAristotle's Metaphysics. Aristotle himself did not know\nthe word. (He had four names for the branch of philosophy that is the\nsubject-matter of Metaphysics: ‘first philosophy’,\n‘first science’, ‘wisdom’, and\n‘theology’.) At least one hundred years after Aristotle's\ndeath, an editor of his works (in all probability, Andronicus of\nRhodes) titled those fourteen books “Ta meta ta\nphusika”—“the after the physicals” or\n“the ones after the physical ones”—the\n“physical ones” being the books contained in what we now\ncall Aristotle's Physics. The title was probably meant to warn\nstudents of Aristotle's philosophy that they should attempt\nMetaphysics only after they had mastered “the physical\nones”, the books about nature or the natural world—that is\nto say, about change, for change is the defining feature of the\nnatural world. This is the probable meaning of the title because Metaphysics is\nabout things that do not change. In one place, Aristotle identifies\nthe subject-matter of first philosophy as “being as such”,\nand, in another as “first causes”. It is a nice—and\nvexed—question what the connection between these two definitions\nis. Perhaps this is the answer: The unchanging first causes have\nnothing but being in common with the mutable things they\ncause. Like us and the objects of our experience—they are,\nand there the resemblance ceases. (For a detailed and informative\nrecent guide to Aristotle's Metaphysics, see Politis\n2004.) Should we assume that ‘metaphysics’ is a name for that\n“science” which is the subject-matter of\nAristotle's Metaphysics? If we assume this, we should be\ncommitted to something in the neighborhood of the following theses:  Any of these three theses might have been regarded as a defensible\nstatement of the subject-matter of what was called\n‘metaphysics’ until the seventeenth century. But then,\nrather suddenly, many topics and problems that Aristotle and the\nMedievals would have classified as belonging to physics (the relation\nof mind and body, for example, or the freedom of the will, or personal\nidentity across time) began to be reassigned to metaphysics. One might\nalmost say that in the seventeenth century metaphysics began to be a\ncatch-all category, a repository of philosophical problems that could\nnot be otherwise classified as epistemology, logic, ethics or other\nbranches of philosophy. (It was at about that time that the word\n‘ontology’ was invented—to be a name for the science\nof being as such, an office that the word ‘metaphysics’\ncould no longer fill.)  The academic rationalists of the\npost-Leibnizian school were aware that the word\n‘metaphysics’ had come to be used in a more inclusive\nsense than it had once been. Christian Wolff attempted to justify this\nmore inclusive sense of the word by this device: while the\nsubject-matter of metaphysics is being, being can be investigated\neither in general or in relation to objects in particular\ncategories. He distinguished between ‘general\nmetaphysics’ (or ontology), the study of being as such, and the\nvarious branches of ‘special metaphysics’, which study the\nbeing of objects of various special sorts, such as souls and material\nbodies. (He does not assign first causes to general\nmetaphysics, however: the study of first causes belongs to natural\ntheology, a branch of special metaphysics.) It is doubtful whether\nthis maneuver is anything more than a verbal ploy. In what sense, for\nexample, is the practitioner of rational psychology (the branch of\nspecial metaphysics devoted to the soul) engaged in a study of being?\nDo souls have a different sort of being from that of other\nobjects?—so that in studying the soul one learns not only about\nits nature (that is, its properties: rationality, immateriality,\nimmortality, its capacity or lack thereof to affect the body\n…), but also about its “mode of being”, and hence\nlearns something about being? It is certainly not true that all, or\neven very many, rational psychologists said anything, qua\nrational psychologists, that could plausibly be construed as a\ncontribution to our understanding of being. Perhaps the wider application of the word ‘metaphysics’\nwas due to the fact that the word ‘physics’ was coming to\nbe a name for a new, quantitative science, the science that bears that\nname today, and was becoming increasingly inapplicable to the\ninvestigation of many traditional philosophical problems about\nchanging things (and of some newly discovered problems about changing\nthings). Whatever the reason for the change may have been, it would be\nflying in the face of current usage (and indeed of the usage of the\nlast three or four hundred years) to stipulate that the subject-matter\nof metaphysics was to be the subject-matter of\nAristotle's Metaphysics. It would, moreover, fly in the face\nof the fact that there are and have been paradigmatic metaphysicians\nwho deny that there are first causes—this denial is certainly a\nmetaphysical thesis in the current sense—others who insist that\neverything changes (Heraclitus and any more recent philosopher who is\nboth a materialist and a nominalist), and others still (Parmenides and\nZeno) who deny that there is a special class of objects that do not\nchange. In trying to characterize metaphysics as a field, the best\nstarting point is to consider the myriad topics traditionally assigned\nto it. If metaphysics now considers a wider range of problems than those\nstudied in Aristotle's Metaphysics, those original problems\ncontinue to belong to its subject-matter. For instance, the topic of\n“being as such” (and “existence as such”, if existence is\nsomething other than being) is one of the matters that belong to\nmetaphysics on any conception of metaphysics. The following theses are\nall paradigmatically metaphysical:  It seems reasonable, moreover, to say that investigations\ninto non-being belong to the topic “being as such” and\nthus belong to metaphysics. (This did not seem reasonable to Meinong,\nwho wished to confine the subject-matter of metaphysics to “the\nactual” and who therefore did not regard his Theory of Objects\nas a metaphysical theory. According to the conception of metaphysics\nadopted in this article, however, his thesis [paraphrased]\n“Predication is independent of being” is paradigmatically\nmetaphysical.) The topics “the first causes of things” and\n“unchanging things”—have continued to interest\nmetaphysicians, though they are not now seen as having any important\nconnection with the topic “being as such”. The first three\nof Aquinas's Five Ways are metaphysical arguments on any conception of\nmetaphysics. Additionally the thesis that there are no first causes\nand the thesis that there are no things that do not change count as\nmetaphysical theses, for in the current conception of metaphysics, the\ndenial of a metaphysical thesis is a metaphysical thesis. No\npost-Medieval philosopher would say anything like this:  I study the first causes of things, and am\ntherefore a metaphysician. My colleague Dr McZed denies that there are\nany first causes and is therefore not a metaphysician; she is rather,\nan anti-metaphysician. In her view, metaphysics is a science with a\nnon-existent subject-matter, like astrology. This feature of the contemporary conception of metaphysics is\nnicely illustrated by a statement of Sartre's: I do not think myself any less a metaphysician in denying the\nexistence of God than Leibniz was in affirming it. (1949:\n139)  An anti-metaphysician in the contemporary sense\nis not a philosopher who denies that there are objects of the sorts\nthat an earlier philosopher might have said formed the subject-matter\nof metaphysics (first causes, things that do not change, universals,\nsubstances, …), but rather a philosopher who denies the\nlegitimacy of the question whether there are objects of those\nsorts.  The three original topics—the nature of being; the first\ncauses of things; things that do not change—remained topics of\ninvestigation by metaphysicians after Aristotle. Another topic,\ndiscussed in the following subsection, occupies an intermediate\nposition between Aristotle and his successors.  We human beings sort things into various classes. And we often\nsuppose that the classes into which we sort things enjoy a kind of\ninternal unity. In this respect they differ from sets in\nthe strict sense of the word. (And no doubt in others. It would seem,\nfor example, that we think of the classes we sort things\ninto—biological species, say—as comprising different\nmembers at different times.) The classes into which we sort things are\nin most cases “natural” classes, classes whose membership\nis in some important sense uniform—“kinds”. We shall not attempt\nan account or definition of ‘natural class’ here. Examples\nmust suffice. There are certainly sets whose members do not make up\nnatural classes: a set that contains all dogs but one, and a set that\ncontains all dogs and exactly one cat do not correspond to natural\nclasses in anyone's view.  And it is tempting to suppose that there is\na sense of “natural” in which dogs make up a natural\nclass, to suppose that in dividing the world into dogs and non-dogs,\nwe “cut nature at the joints”. It is, however, a\nrespectable philosophical thesis that the idea of a natural class\ncannot survive philosophical scrutiny. If that respectable thesis is\ntrue, the topic “the categories of being” is a\npseudo-topic. Let us simply assume that the respectable thesis is\nfalse and that things fall into various natural\nclasses—hereinafter, simply classes. Some of the classes into which we sort things are more\ncomprehensive than others: all dogs are animals, but not all animals\nare dogs; all animals are living organisms, but not all living\norganisms are animals …. Now the very expression “sort\nthings into classes” suggests that there is a most comprehensive\nclass: the class of things, the class of things that can be sorted\ninto classes.  But is this so?—and if it is so, are there\nclasses that are “just less comprehensive” than this\nuniversal class? If there are, can we identify them?—and are\nthere a vast (perhaps even an infinite) number of them, or some\nlargish, messy number like forty-nine, or some small, neat number like\nseven or four? Let us call any such less\ncomprehensive classes the ‘categories of being’ or the\n‘ontological categories’. (The former term, if not the latter,\npresupposes a particular position on one question about the nature of\nbeing: that everything is, that the universal class is the class of\nbeings, the class of things that are. It thus presupposes that Meinong\nwas wrong to say that “there are things of which it is true that\nthere are no such things”.) The topic “the categories of being” is intermediate\nbetween the topic “the nature of being” and the topics\nthat fall under the post-Medieval conception of metaphysics for a\nreason that can be illustrated by considering the problem of\nuniversals.  Universals, if they indeed exist, are, in the first\ninstance, properties or qualities or attributes (i.e.,\n“ductility” or “whiteness”) that are\nsupposedly universally “present in” the members of classes\nof things and relations (i.e., “being to the north of”)\nthat are supposedly universally present in the members of classes of\nsequences of things. “In the first instance”: it may be\nthat things other than qualities and relations are universals,\nalthough qualities and relations are the items most commonly put\nforward as examples of universals. It may be that the novel War\nand Peace is a universal, a thing that is in some mode present in\neach of the many tangible copies of the novel. It may be that the word\n“horse” is a universal, a thing that is present in each of\nthe many audible utterances of the word. And it may be that natural\nclasses or kinds are themselves universals—it may be that there\nis such a thing as “the horse” or the species Equus\ncaballus, distinct from its defining attribute “being a\nhorse” or “equinity”, and in some sense\n“present in” each horse. (Perhaps some difference between\nthe attribute “being a horse” and the attribute\n“being either a horse or a kitten” explains why the former\nis the defining attribute of a kind and the latter is not.  Perhaps\nthe former attribute exists and the latter does not; perhaps the\nformer has the second-order attribute “naturalness” and\nthe latter does not; perhaps the former is more easily apprehended by\nthe intellect than the latter.) The thesis that universals exist—or at any rate\n“subsist” or “have being”—is variously\ncalled ‘realism’ or ‘Platonic realism’ or\n‘platonism’. All three terms are objectionable. Aristotle\nbelieved in the reality of universals, but it would be at best an\noxymoron to call him a platonist or a Platonic realist. And\n‘realism’ tout court has served as a name for a variety of\nphilosophical theses. The thesis that universals do not exist—do\nnot so much as subsist; have no being of any sort—is generally\ncalled ‘nominalism’. This term, too is objectionable. At\none time, those who denied the existence of universals were fond of\nsaying things like:  There is no such thing as “being a horse”:\nthere is only the name [nomen, gen. nominis]\n“horse”, a mere flatus vocis [puff of\nsound]. Present-day nominalists, however,\nare aware, if earlier nominalists were not, that if the phrase\n‘the name “horse” ’ designated an\nobject, the object it designated would itself be a universal or\nsomething very like one. It would not be a mere puff of sound but\nwould rather be what was common to the many puffs of sound that were\nits tokens. The old debate between the nominalists and the realists continues\nto the present day. Most realists suppose that universals constitute\none of the categories of being. This supposition could certainly be\ndisputed without absurdity. Perhaps there is a natural\nclass of things to which all universals belong but which contains\nother things as well (and is not the class of all things). Perhaps,\nfor example, numbers and propositions are not universals, and perhaps\nnumbers and propositions and universals are all members of a class of\n“abstract objects”, a class that some things do not belong\nto. Or perhaps there is such a thing as “the whiteness of the\nTaj Mahal” and perhaps this object and the universal\n“whiteness”—but not the Taj Mahal itself—both\nbelong to the class of “properties”. Let us call such a\nclass—a proper subclass of an ontological category, a natural\nclass that is neither the class of all things nor one of the\nontological categories—an ‘ontological sub-category’. It may\nindeed be that universals make up a sub-category of being and are\nmembers of the category of being “abstract object”. But\nfew if any philosophers would suppose that universals were members of\nforty-nine sub-categories—much less of a vast number or an\ninfinity of sub-categories. Most philosophers who believe in the\nreality of universals would want to say that universals, if they do\nnot constitute an ontological category, at least constitute one of the\n“higher” sub-categories. If dogs form a natural class,\nthis class is—by the terms of our definition—an\nontological sub-category. And this class will no doubt be a subclass\nof many sub-categories: the genus canis, the class (in the\nbiological sense) mammalia, …, and so through a chain\nof sub-categories that eventually reaches some very general\nsub-category like “substance” or “material\nobject”. Thus, although dogs may compose an ontological\nsub-category, this sub-category—unlike the category\n“universal”—is one of the “lower”\nones. These reflections suggest that the topic “the categories\nof being” should be understood to comprehend both the categories\nof being sensu stricto and their immediate\nsub-categories. Does the topic “the categories of being” belong to\nmetaphysics in the “old” sense? A case can be made for\nsaying that it does, based on the fact that Plato's theory of forms\n(universals, attributes) is a recurrent theme in\nAristotle's Metaphysics. In Metaphysics, two of\nPlato's central theses about the forms come in for vigorous criticism:\n(i) that things that would, if they existed, be “inactive”\n(the forms) could be the primary beings, the “most real”\nthings, and (ii) that the attributes of things exist\n“separately” from the things whose attributes they are. We\nshall be concerned only with (ii). In the terminology of the Schools,\nthat criticism can be put this way: Plato wrongly believed that\nuniversals existed ante res (prior to objects); the correct\nview is that universals exist in rebus (in objects). It is\nbecause this aspect of the problem of universals—whether\nuniversals exist ante res or in rebus—is\ndiscussed at length in Metaphysics, that a strong case can be\nmade for saying that the problem of universals falls under the old\nconception of metaphysics. (And the question whether universals, given\nthat they exist at all, exist ante res or in rebus\nis as controversial in the twenty-first century as it was in the\nthirteenth century and the fourth century B.C.E.) If we do decide that\nthe problem of universals belongs to metaphysics on the old\nconception, then, since we have liberalized the old\nconception by applying to it the contemporary rule that\nthe denial of a metaphysical position is to be regarded as a\nmetaphysical position, we shall have to say that the question whether\nuniversals exist at all is a metaphysical question under the old\nconception—and that nominalism is therefore a metaphysical\nthesis. There is, however, also a case to made against classifying the\nproblem of universals as a problem of metaphysics in the (liberalized)\nold sense. For there is more to the problem of universals than the\nquestion whether universals exist and the question whether, if they do\nexist, their existence is ante res or in rebus. For\nexample, the problem of universals also includes questions about the\nrelation between universals (if such there be) and the things that are\nnot universals, the things usually called particulars. Aristotle did\nnot consider these questions in the Metaphysics. One might\ntherefore plausibly contend that only one part of the problem of\nuniversals (the part that pertains to the existence and nature of\nuniversals) belongs to metaphysics in the old sense. At one time, a\nphilosopher might have said,  The universal “doghood” is a thing\nthat does not change. Therefore, questions about its nature belong to\nmetaphysics, the science of things that do not change. But dogs are\nthings that change. Therefore, questions concerning the relation of\ndogs to doghood do not belong to metaphysics. But no contemporary philosopher would divide the topics that\nway—not even if he or she believed that doghood existed and was\na thing that did not change. A contemporary philosopher—if that\nphilosopher concedes that there is any problem that can properly be\ncalled “the problem of universals”—will see the\nproblem of universals as a problem properly so called, as a problem\nhaving the kind of internal unity that leads philosophers to speak of\na philosophical problem. And the same point applies to\nthe topic “the categories of being”: every philosopher who\nis willing to say that “What are the categories of being?”\nis a meaningful question will assign every aspect of that question to\nmetaphysics Let us consider some aspects of the problem of universals that\nconcern changing things. (That is, that concern particulars—for\neven if there are particulars that do not change, most of the\nparticulars that figure in discussions of the problem of universals as\nexamples are things that change.) Consider two white\nparticulars—the Taj Mahal, say, and the Washington Monument. And\nsuppose that both these particulars are white in virtue of (i.e.,\ntheir being white consists in) their bearing some one, identifiable\nrelation to the universal “whiteness”. Suppose further\nthat we are able to single out this relation by some sort of act of\nintellectual attention or abstraction, and that (having done so) we\nhave given it the name “falling under”. All white things\nand only white things fall under whiteness, and falling under\nwhiteness is what it is to be white. (We pass over many questions that\nwould have to be addressed if we were discussing the problem of\nuniversals for its own sake. For example, both blueness\nand redness are spectral color-properties, and whiteness is not. Does\nthis fact imply that “being a spectral color-property” is,\nas one might say, a second-order universal? If so, does blueness\n“fall under” this universal in the same sense as the sense\nin which a copy of Philosophical Studies falls under\nblueness?) Now what can we say about this relation, this “falling\nunder”? What is it about the two objects whiteness and the Taj\nMahal that is responsible for the fact that the latter falls under the\nformer? Is the Taj perhaps a “bundle” of universalia\nante res, and does it fall under whiteness in virtue of the fact\nthat whiteness is one of the universals that is a constituent of the\nbundle that it is? Or might it be that a particular like the Taj,\nalthough it indeed has universals as constituents, is something more\nthan its universal constituents? Might it be that the Taj has a\nconstituent that is not a universal, a “substrate”, a\nparticular that is in some sense property-less and that holds the\nuniversal constituents of the Taj together—that\n“bundles” them? (If we take that position, then we may\nwant to say, with Armstrong (1989: 94–96), that the Taj is a\n‘thick particular’ and its substrate a ‘thin\nparticular’: a thick particular being a thin particular taken\ntogether with the properties it bundles.) Or might the Taj have\nconstituents that are neither universals nor substrates? Might we have\nbeen too hasty when we defined ‘particulars’ as things\nthat are not universals? Could there perhaps be two kinds of\nnon-universals, concrete non-universals or concrete individuals (those\nwould be the particulars, thick or thin), and abstract non-universals\nor abstract individuals (‘accidents’ or\n‘tropes’ or ‘property instances’), things that\nare properties or qualities (and relations as well), things like\n“the (individual) whiteness of the Taj Mahal”? Is the Taj\nperhaps a bundle not of universals but of accidents? Or is it composed\nof a substrate and a bundle of accidents? And we cannot neglect the\npossibility that Aristotle was right and that universals exist\nonly in rebus. If that is so, we must ask what the relation\nis between the matter that composes a particular and the universals\nthat inhere in it—that inhere simultaneously in\n“this” matter and in “that” matter. The series of questions that was set out in the preceding paragraph\nwas introduced by observing that the problem of universals includes\nboth questions about the existence and nature of universals and\nquestions about how universals are related to the particulars that\nfall under them. Many of the theories that were alluded to in that\nseries of questions could be described as theories of the\n“ontological structure” of non-universals. We can contrast\nontological structure with mereological structure. A philosophical\nquestion concerns the mereological structure of an object if it is a\nquestion about the relation between that object and those of its\nconstituents that belong to the same ontological category as the\nobject. For example, the philosopher who asks whether the Taj Mahal\nhas a certain block of marble among its constituents essentially or\nonly accidentally is asking a question about the mereological\nstructure of the Taj, since the block and the building belong to the\nsame ontological category. But the philosopher who asks whether the\nTaj has “whiteness” as a constituent and the philosopher\nwho supposes that the Taj does have this property-constituent and\nasks, “What is the nature of this relation ‘constituent\nof’ that ‘whiteness’ bears to the Taj?” are\nasking questions about its ontological structure. Many philosophers have supposed that particulars fall under\nuniversals by somehow incorporating them into their ontological\nstructure. And other philosophers have supposed that the ontological\nstructure of a particular incorporates individual properties or\naccidents—and that an accident is an accident of a certain\nparticular just in virtue of being a constituent of that\nparticular. Advocates of the existence of ante res universals, and\nparticularly those who deny that these universals are constituents of\nparticulars, tend to suppose that universals\nabound—that there is not only such a universal as\nwhiteness but such a universal as “being both white and round\nand either shiny or not made of silver”. Advocates of other\ntheories of universals are almost always less liberal in the\nrange of universals whose existence they will allow. The\nadvocate of in rebus universals is unlikely to grant the\nexistence of “being both white and round and either shiny or not\nmade of silver”, even in the case in which there is an object\nthat is both white and round and either shiny or not made of silver\n(such as a non-shiny white plastic ball). The two topics “the categories of being” and “the\nontological structure of objects” are intimately related to each\nother and to the problem of universals. It is not possible to propose\na solution to the problem of universals that does not have\nimplications for the topic “the categories of\nbeing”. (Even nominalism implies that at least one popular\ncandidate for the office “ontological category” is\nnon-existent or empty.) It is certainly possible to maintain that\nthere are ontological categories that are not directly related to the\nproblem of universals (“proposition”, “state of\naffairs”, “event”, “mere\npossibile”), but any philosopher who maintains this\nwill nevertheless maintain that if there are universals they make up\nat least one of the higher ontological sub-categories. And it seems\nthat it is possible to speak of ontological structure only if one\nsupposes that there are objects of different ontological\ncategories. So whatever metaphysics comprehends, it must comprehend\nevery aspect of the problem of universals and every aspect of the\ntopics “the categories of being” and “the\nontological structure of objects”. For a recent investigation of\nthe problems that have been discussed in this section, see Lowe\n(2006). We turn now to a topic that strictly speaking belongs to “the\ncategories of being”, but which is important enough to be\ntreated separately. Some things (if they exist at all) are present only\n“in” other things: a smile, a haircut (product, not\nprocess), a hole …. Such things may be opposed to things that\nexist “in their own right”. Metaphysicians call the things\nthat exist in their own right ‘substances’. Aristotle\ncalled them ‘protai ousiai’ or “primary\nbeings”. They make up the most important of his ontological\ncategories. Several features define protai ousiai: they are\nsubjects of predication that cannot themselves be predicated of things\n(they are not universals); things exist “in” them, but\nthey do not exist “in” things (they are not accidents like\nSocrates' wisdom or his ironic smile); they have determinate\nidentities (essences). This last feature could be put this way in\ncontemporary terms: if the prote ousia x exists at a\ncertain time and the prote ousia y exists at some\nother time, it makes sense to ask whether x and y are\nthe same, are numerically identical (and the question must have a\ndeterminate answer); and the question whether a given prote\nousia would exist in some set of counterfactual circumstances\nmust likewise have an answer (at least if the circumstances are\nsufficiently determinate—if, for example, they constitute a\npossible world.  More on this in the next section). It is difficult to suppose that smiles\nor holes have this sort of determinate identity. To ask whether the\nsmile Socrates smiled today is the smile he smiled yesterday (or is\nthe smile he would have smiled if Crito had asked one of his\ncharmingly naïve questions) can only be a question about descriptive\nidentity.  Aristotle uses ‘(prote) ousia’ not\nonly as a count-noun but as a mass term. (He generally writes\n‘ousia’ without qualification when he believes\nthat the context will make it clear that he means ‘prote\nousia’.) For example, he not only asks questions like\n“Is Socrates a (prote) ousia?” and\n“What is a (prote) ousia”?, but\nquestions like “What is the (prote) ousia of\nSocrates?” and “What is\n(prote) ousia?” (Which question he is asking\nsometimes has to be inferred from the context, since there is no\nindefinite article in Greek.) In the count-noun sense of the term,\nAristotle identifies at least some (protai) ousiai\nwith ta hupokeimena or “underlying\nthings”. Socrates, for example, is a hupokeimenon in\nthat he “lies under” the in rebus universals\nunder which he falls and the accidents that inhere in\nhim. ‘To hupokeimenon’ has an approximate Latin\nequivalent in ‘substantia’, “that which\nstands under”. (Apparently, “to stand under” and\n“to lie under” are equally good metaphorical descriptions\nof the relations a thing bears to its qualities and accidents.) Owing\nboth to the close association of (protai) ousiai\nand hupokeimena in Aristotle's philosophy and to the absence\na suitable Latin equivalent of ‘ousia’\n‘substantia’ became the customary Latin\ntranslation of the count-noun\n‘(prote) ousia’.  The question whether there in fact are substances continues to be\none of the central questions of metaphysics. Several closely related\nquestions are: How, precisely, should the concept of substance be\nunderstood?; Which of the items (if any of them) among those we\nencounter in everyday life are substances?; If there are substances at\nall, how many of them are there?—is there only one as Spinoza\ncontended, or are there many as most of the rationalists supposed?;\nWhat kinds of substances are there?—are there immaterial\nsubstances, eternal substances, necessarily existent substances? It must be emphasized that there is no universally accepted and\nprecise definition of ‘substance’. Depending on how one\nunderstood the word (or the concept) one might say either that Hume\ndenied that there were any substances or that he held that the only\nsubstances (or the only substances of which we have any knowledge)\nwere impressions and ideas. It would seem, however, that most\nphilosophers who are willing to use the word ‘substance’\nat all would deny that any of the following (if they exist) are\nsubstances: The nature of being, the problem of universals, and the nature of\nsubstance have been recognized as topics that belong to\n“metaphysics” by almost everyone who has used the word. We now\nturn to topics that belong to metaphysics only in the post-Medieval\nsense. Philosophers have long recognized that there is an important\ndistinction within the class of true propositions: the distinction\nbetween those propositions that might have been false and those that\ncould not have been false (those that must be true). Compare, for\nexample, the proposition that Paris is the capital of France and the\nproposition that there is a prime between every number greater than 1\nand its double. Both are true, but the former could have been false\nand the latter could not have been false. Likewise, there is a\ndistinction to be made within the class of false propositions: between\nthose that could have been true and those that could not have been\ntrue (those that had to be false). Some Medieval philosophers supposed that the fact that true\npropositions are of the two sorts “necessarily true” and\n“contingently true” (and the corresponding fact about\nfalse propositions) showed that there were two “modes” in\nwhich a proposition could be true (or false): the mode of contingency\nand the mode of necessity—hence the term ‘modality’.\nPresent-day philosophers retain the Medieval term\n‘modality’ but now it means no more than “pertaining\nto possibility and necessity”. The types of modality of interest\nto metaphysicians fall into two camps: modality de re and\nmodality de dicto.  Modality de dicto is the modality of propositions\n(‘dictum’ means proposition, or\nclose enough). If modality were coextensive with modality de\ndicto, it would be at least a defensible position that the topic\nof modality belongs to logic rather than to metaphysics. (Indeed, the\nstudy of modal logics goes back to Aristotle's Prior\nAnalytics.) But many philosophers also think there is a second kind of\nmodality, modality de re—the modality of things. (The\nmodality of substances, certainly, and perhaps of things in other\nontological categories.) The status of modality de re is\nundeniably a metaphysical topic, and we assign it to the\n“new” metaphysics because, although one can ask modal\nquestions about things that do not change—God, for example, or\nuniversals—a large proportion of the work that has been done in\nthis area concerns the modal features of changing things. There are two types of modality de re. The first concerns\nthe existence of things—of human beings, for example. If Sally,\nan ordinary human being, says, “I might not have existed”,\nalmost everyone will take her to have stated an obvious truth. And if\nwhat she has said is indeed true, then she exists contingently. That\nis to say, she is a contingent being: a being who might not have\nexisted.  A necessary being, in contrast, is a being of which it is\nfalse that it might not have existed. Whether any objects are\nnecessary beings is an important question of modal metaphysics. Some\nphilosophers have gone so far to maintain that all objects are necessary\nbeings, since necessary existence is a truth of logic in what seems to\nthem to be the best quantified modal logic. (See Barcan 1946 for the\nfirst modern connection between necessary existence and quantified\nmodal logic. Barcan did not draw any metaphysical conclusions from her\nlogical results, but later authors, especially Williamson 2013\nhave.)  The second kind of modality de re concerns the properties\nof things.  Like the existence of things, the possession of properties\nby things is subject to modal qualification. If Sally, who speaks\nEnglish, says, “I might have spoken only French”, almost\neveryone will take that statement to be no less obviously true than\nher statement that she might not have existed. And if what she has\nsaid is indeed true, then “speaking English” is a property\nthat she has only contingently or (the more usual word) only\naccidentally.  Additionally there may be properties which some objects\nhave essentially. A thing has a property essentially if it could not\nexist without having that property. Examples of essential properties\ntend to be controversial, largely because the most\nplausible examples of a certain object's possessing a property\nessentially are only as plausible as the thesis that that object\npossesses those properties at all. For example, if Sally is a physical\nobject, as physicalists suppose, then it is very plausible for them to\nsuppose further that she is essentially a physical object—but it\nis controversial whether they are right to suppose that she is a\nphysical object. And, of course, the same thing can be\nsaid, mutatis mutandis, concerning dualists and the property\nof being a non-physical object. It would seem, however, that Sally is\neither essentially a physical object or essentially a non-physical\nobject. And many find it plausible to suppose that (whether she is\nphysical or non-physical) she has the property “not being a\npoached egg” essentially. The most able and influential enemy of modality (both de\ndicto and de re) was W. V. Quine, who vigorously\ndefended both the following theses. First, that modality de\ndicto can be understood only in terms of the concept of\nanalyticity (a problematical concept in his view).  Secondly, that\nmodality de re cannot be understood in terms of analyticity\nand therefore cannot be understood at all. Quine argued for this\nlatter claim by proposing what he took to be decisive counterexamples\nto theories that take essentiality to be meaningful. If\nmodality de re makes any sense, Quine contended (1960:\n199–200), cyclists must be regarded as essentially\nbipedal—for “Cyclists are bipedal” would be regarded\nas an analytic sentence by those who believe in analyticity. But\nmathematicians are only accidentally bipedal (“Mathematicians\nare bipedal” is not analytic by anyone's lights). What then,\nQuine proceeded to ask, of someone who is both a mathematician and a\ncyclist?—that person seems both essentially and only\naccidentally bi-pedal. Since this is incoherent, Quine thought that\nmodality de re is incoherent. Most philosophers are now convinced, however, that Quine's\n“mathematical cyclist” argument has been adequately\nanswered by Saul Kripke (1972), Alvin Plantinga (1974) and various\nother defenders of modality de re. Kripke and Plantinga's\ndefenses of modality are paradigmatically metaphysical (except insofar\nas they directly address Quine's linguistic argument). Both make\nextensive use of the concept of a possible world in defending the\nintelligibility of modality (both de re and de\ndicto). Leibniz was the first philosopher to use ‘possible\nworld’ as a philosophical term of art, but Kripke's and\nPlantinga's use of the phrase is different from his. For Leibniz, a\npossible world was a possible creation: God's act of creation consists\nin his choosing one possible world among many to be the one world that\nhe creates—the “actual” world. For Kripke and\nPlantinga, however, a possible world is a possible “whole of\nreality”. For Leibniz, God and his actions “stand\noutside” all possible worlds. For Kripke and Plantinga, no\nbeing, not even God, could stand outside the whole system of possible\nworlds. A Kripke-Plantinga (KP) world is an abstract object of some\nsort. Let us suppose that a KP world is a possible state of affairs\n(this is Plantinga's idea; Kripke says nothing so definite). Consider\nany given state of affairs; let us say, Paris being the capital of\nFrance.  This state of affairs obtains, since Paris is\nthe capital of France. By contrast, the state of affairs Tours\nbeing the capital of France does not obtain. The latter state of\naffairs does, however, exist, for there is such a state of\naffairs. (Obtaining thus stands to states of affairs as truth stands\nto propositions: although the proposition that Tours is the capital of\nFrance is not true, there nevertheless is such a proposition.) The\nstate of affairs x is said to include the state of\naffairs y if it is impossible for x to obtain\nand y not to obtain. If it is impossible for both x\nand y to obtain, then each precludes the other. A possible\nworld is simply a possible state of affairs that, for every state of\naffairs x, either includes or precludes x; the actual\nworld is the one such state of affairs that obtains. Using the KP theory we can answer Quine's challenge as follows. In\nevery possible world, every cyclist in that world is bipedal in that\nworld. (Assuming with Quine that necessarily cyclists are\nbipedal. Apparently he had not foreseen adaptive bicycles.)\nNevertheless for any particular cyclist, there is some possible world\nwhere he (the same person) is not bipedal. Once we draw this\ndistinction, we can see that Quine's argument is invalid. More\ngenerally, on the KP theory, theses about de re essential\nproperties need not be analytic; they are meaningful\nbecause they express claims about an object's properties in various\npossible worlds.  We can also use the notion of possible worlds to define many other\nmodal concepts. For example, a necessarily true proposition is a\nproposition that would be true no matter what possible world was\nactual. Socrates is a contingent being if there is some possible world\nsuch that he would not exist if that world were actual, and he has the\nproperty “being human” essentially if every possible world\nthat includes his existence also includes his being human. Kripke and\nPlantinga have greatly increased the clarity of modal discourse (and\nparticularly of modal discourse de re), but at the expense of\nintroducing a modal ontology, an ontology of possible worlds. Theirs is not the only modal ontology on offer. The main\nalternative to the KP theory has been the ‘modal realism’\nchampioned by David Lewis (1986). Lewis's modal ontology appeals to\nobjects called possible worlds, but these “worlds” are\nconcrete objects. What we call the actual world is one of these\nconcrete objects, the spatiotemporally connected universe we\ninhabit. What we call “non-actual” worlds are other\nconcrete universes that are spatiotemporally isolated from ours (and\nfrom each other). There is, Lewis contends, a vast array of non-actual\nworlds, an array that contains at least those worlds that are\ngenerated by an ingenious principle of recombination, a principle that\ncan be stated without the use of modal language (1986: 87). For Lewis,\nmoreover, “actual” is an indexical term: when I speak of\nthe actual world, I refer to the world of which I am an\ninhabitant—and so for any speaker who is “in” (who\nis a part of) any world. In the matter of modality de dicto, Lewis's theory\nproceeds in a manner that is at least parallel to the KP theory: there\ncould be flying pigs if there are flying pigs in some possible world\n(if some world has flying pigs as parts). But the case is otherwise\nwith modality de re. Since every ordinary object is in only\none of the concrete worlds, Lewis must either say that each such\nobject has all its properties essentially or else adopt a treatment of\nmodality de re that is not parallel to the KP treatment. He\nchooses the latter alternative. Although Socrates is in only the\nactual world, Lewis holds, he has ‘counterparts’ in some\nother worlds, objects that play the role in those worlds that he plays\nin this world. If all Socrates' counterparts are human, then we may\nsay that he is essentially human. If one of Hubert Humphrey's\ncounterparts won (the counterpart of) the 1968 presidential election,\nit is correct to say of Humphrey that he could have won that\nelection. In addition to the obvious stark ontological contrast between the\ntwo theories, they differ in two important ways in their implications\nfor the philosophy of modality. First, if Lewis is right, then modal\nconcepts can be defined in terms of paradigmatically non-modal\nconcepts, since ‘world’ and all of Lewis's other technical\nterms can be defined using only ‘is spatiotemporally related\nto’, ‘is a part of’ and the vocabulary of set\ntheory. For Kripke and Plantinga, however, modal concepts are sui\ngeneris, indefinable or having only definitions that appeal to\nother modal concepts. Secondly, Lewis's theory implies a kind of\nanti-realism concerning modality de re. This is because there\nis no one relation that is the counterpart relation—there are\nrather various ways or respects in which one could say that objects in\ntwo worlds “play the same role” in their respective\nworlds. Socrates, therefore, may well have non-human counterparts\nunder one counterpart relation and no non-human\ncounterparts under another. And the choice of a counterpart relation\nis a pragmatic or interest-relative choice. But on the KP theory, it\nis an entirely objective question whether Socrates fails to be human\nin some world in which he exists: the answer must be Yes or No and is\nindependent of human choices and interests. Whatever one may think of these theories when one considers them\nin their own right (as theories of modality, as theories\nwith various perhaps objectionable ontological commitments), one must\nconcede that they are paradigmatically metaphysical theories. They\nbear witness to the resurgence of metaphysics in\nanalytical philosophy in the last third of the twentieth century. Long before the theory of relativity represented space and\ntime as aspects of or abstractions from a single entity, spacetime,\nphilosophers saw space and time as intimately related. (A glance\nthrough any dictionary of quotations suggests that the philosophical\npairing of space and time reflects a natural, pre-philosophical\ntendency: “Had we but world enough, and time …”;\n“Dwellers all in time and space”.) Kant, for example,\ntreated space and time in his Transcendental Aesthetic as\nthings that should be explained by a single, unified theory. And his\ntheory of space and time, revolutionary though it may have been in\nother respects, was in this respect typical of philosophical accounts\nof space and time. Whatever the source of the conviction that space\nand time are two members of a “species” (and the only two\nmembers of that species), they certainly raise similar philosophical\nquestions. It can be asked whether space extends infinitely in every\ndirection, and it can be asked whether time extends infinitely in\neither of the two temporal “directions”. Just as one can\nask whether, if space is finite, it has an “end” (whether\nit is bounded or unbounded), one may ask of time whether, if it is\nfinite, it had a beginning or will have an end or whether it might\nhave neither, but rather be “circular” (be finite but\nunbounded). As one can ask whether there could be two extended objects\nthat were not spatially related to each other, one can ask whether\nthere could be two events that were not temporally related to each\nother. One can ask whether space is (a) a real thing—a\nsubstance—a thing that exists independently of its\ninhabitants, or (b) a mere system of\nrelations among those inhabitants. And one can ask the same\nquestion about time.  But there are also questions about time that have no spatial\nanalogues—or at least no obvious and uncontroversial\nanalogues. There are, for example, questions about the grounds of\nvarious asymmetries between the past and the future—why is our\nknowledge of the past better than our knowledge of the future?; why do\nwe regard an unpleasant event that is about to happen differently from\nthe way we regard an unpleasant event that has recently happened?; why\ndoes causation seem to have a privileged temporal direction? There do\nnot seem to be objective asymmetries like this in space. There is also the question of temporal passage—the question\nwhether the apparent “movement” of time (or the apparent\nmovement of ourselves and the objects of our experience through or in\ntime) is a real feature of the world or some sort of illusion. In one\nway of thinking about time, there is a privileged temporal direction\nmarking the difference between the past, present, and\nfuture. A-theorists hold that time is fundamentally structured in\nterms of a past/present/future distinction. Times change from past to\npresent to future, giving rise to passage. (The name\n‘A-theorist’ descends from J.M.E. McTaggart's (1908) name\nfor the sequence past/present/future which he called the\n‘A-series’.) Within the A-theory, we might further ask\nwhether the past and future have the “same sort of\nreality” as the present. Presentist A-theorists, like Prior\n1998, deny that the past or future have any concrete reality.\nPresentists typically think of the past and future as, at best, akin\nto abstract possible worlds—they are the way the world was or will\nbe, just as possible worlds are ways the actual world could be. Other\nA-theorists, like Sullivan (2012), hold that the present is\nmetaphysically privileged but deny that there is any ontological\ndifference between the past, present, and future. More generally,\nA-theorists often incorporate strategies from modal metaphysics into\ntheir theories about the relation of the past and the future to the\npresent.  According to B-theories of time, the only fundamental distinction we\nshould draw is that some events and times are earlier or later\nrelative to others. (These relations are called\n‘B-relations’, a term also derived from McTaggart). According\nto the B-theorists, there is no objective passage of time, or at least\nnot in the sense of time passing from future to present and from\npresent to past.  B-theorists typically maintain that all past and\nfuture times are real in the same sense in which the present time is\nreal—the present is in no sense metaphysically privileged.  It is also true, and less often remarked on, that space raises\nphilosophical questions that have no temporal analogues—or at\nleast no obvious and uncontroversial analogues. Why, for example, does\nspace have three dimensions and not four or seven? On the face of it,\ntime is essentially one-dimensional and space is not essentially\nthree-dimensional. It also seems that the metaphysical problems about\nspace that have no temporal analogues depend on the fact that space,\nunlike time, has more than one dimension. For example, consider the\nproblem of incongruent counterparts: those who think space is a mere\nsystem of relations struggled to explain our intuition that we could\ndistinguish a world containing only a left hand from a world\ncontaining only a right hand. So it seems there is an intuitive\norientation to objects in space itself. It is less clear whether the\nproblems about time that have no spatial analogues are connected with\nthe one-dimensionality of time. Finally, one can raise questions about whether space and time are\nreal at all—and, if they are real, to what extent (so to speak)\nthey are real. Might it be that space and time are not constituents of\nreality as God perceives reality but nevertheless “well-founded\nphenomena” (as Leibniz held)? Was Kant right when he denied\nspatial and temporal features to “things as they are in\nthemselves”?—and right to contend that space and time are\n“forms of our intuition”? Or was McTaggart's position the\nright one: that space and time are wholly unreal? If these problems about space and time belong to metaphysics only\nin the post-Medieval sense, they are nevertheless closely related to\nquestions about first causes and universals. First causes are\ngenerally thought by those who believe in them to be eternal and\nnon-local. God, for example—both the impersonal God of Aristotle\nand the personal God of Medieval Christian, Jewish, and Muslim\nphilosophy—is generally said to be eternal, and the personal God\nis said to be omnipresent. To say that God is eternal is to say either\nthat he is everlasting or that he is somehow outside time. And this\nraises the metaphysical question of whether it is possible for there to\nbe a being—not a universal or an abstract object of some other\nsort, but an active substance—that is everlasting or\nnon-temporal. An omnipresent being is a being that does not occupy any\nregion of space (not even the whole of it, as the luminiferous ether\nof nineteenth-century physics would if it existed), and whose causal\ninfluence is nevertheless equally present in every region of space\n(unlike universals, to which the concept of causality does not\napply). The doctrine of divine omnipresence raises the metaphysical\nquestion whether it is possible for there to be a being with this\nfeature. Ante res universals are said by some of their\nproponents (precisely those who deny that universals are constituents\nof particulars) to have no relations to space and time but\n“vicarious” ones: the ante res universal\n“whiteness” may be said to be present where each white\nparticular is, but only in a way analogous to the way in which the\nnumber two is present where each pair of spatial things is.  But it is\ndoubtful whether this is a position that is possible for a\nmetaphysician who says that a white thing is a bundle composed of\nwhiteness and various other universals. Those who believe in the\nexistence of in rebus universals are fond of saying, or have\nbeen in recent years, that these universals (‘immanent\nuniversals’ is a currently popular name for them) are\n“multiply located”—“wholly present” at\neach place at which the things that fall under them are present. And\nby this they certainly do not mean that whiteness is present in many\ndifferent regions of space only vicariously, only as a number might be\nsaid to be present wherever there are things in that number, only in\nvirtue of bearing the non-spatial relation “being had by”\nto a multitude of particulars each of which is present in a single\nregion of space. All theories of universals, therefore, raise\nquestions about how things in various ontological categories are\nrelated to space. And all these questions have temporal analogues. Related to questions about the nature of space and time are\nquestions about the nature of objects that take up space or persist\nthrough time, and these questions form yet another central theme in\npost-medieval metaphysics. Are some or all objects composed of proper\nparts? Must an object have proper parts in order to “fill\nup” a region of space—or are there extended simples? Can\nmore that one object be located in exactly the same region? Do objects\npersist through change by having temporal parts? Much work on persistence and constitution has focused on efforts to\naddress a closely knit family of puzzles—the puzzles of\ncoincidence. One such puzzle is the “problem of the statue and\nthe lump”. Consider a gold statue. Many metaphysicians contend\nthat there is at least one material object that is spatially\nco-extensive with the statue, a lump of gold. This is\neasily shown, they say, by an appeal to Leibniz's Law (the principle\nof the non-identity of discernibles). There is a statue here and there\nis a lump of gold here, and—if the causal story of the statue's\ncoming to be is of the usual sort—the lump of gold existed\nbefore the statue. And even if God has created the statue (and\nperforce the lump) ex nihilo and will at some point\nannihilate the statue (and thereby annihilate the lump), they further\nargue, the statue and the lump, although they exist at exactly the\nsame times, have different modal properties: the lump has the property\n“can survive radical deformation” and the statue does\nnot. Or so these metaphysicians conclude. But it has seemed to other\nmetaphysicians that this conclusion is absurd, for it is absurd to\nsuppose (these others say) that there could be spatially coincident\nphysical objects that share all their momentary\nnon-modal properties. Hence, the problem: What, if anything, is the\nflaw in the argument for the non-identity of the statue and the\nlump?  A second puzzle in this family is the “problem of Tib and\nTibbles”. Tibbles is a cat. Call his tail “Tail”.\nCall all of him but his tail “Tib”. Suppose Tail is cut\noff—or, better, annihilated. Tibbles still exists, for a cat can\nsurvive the loss of its tail. And it would seem that Tib will exist\nafter the “loss” of Tail, because Tib lost no part. But\nwhat will be the relation between Tib and Tibbles? Can it be identity?\nNo, that is ruled out by the non-identity of discernibles, for Tibbles\nwill have become smaller and Tib will remain the same size. But then,\nonce again, we seem to have a case of spatially coincident material\nobjects that share their momentary non-modal properties. Both these constitution problems turn on questions about the\nidentities of spatially coincident objects—and, indeed, of\nobjects that share all their (proper) parts. (A third famous problem\nof material constitution—the problem of the Ship of\nTheseus—raises questions of a different sort.) Some\nmetaphysicians contend that the relation between the lump and the\nstatue, on the one hand, and the relation between Tib and Tibbles, on\nthe other, cannot be fully understood in terms of the concepts of\nparthood and (non-) identity, but require a further concept, a\nnon-mereological concept, the concept of “constitution”:\nthe pre-existent lump at a certain point in time comes to constitute\nthe statue (or a certain quantity of gold or certain gold atoms that\nfirst constituted only the lump come to constitute them both);\npre-existent Tib at a certain point in time comes to constitute\nTibbles (or certain cat-flesh or certain molecules …).  (Baker\n2000 is a defense of this thesis.) Others contend that all the\nrelations between the objects that figure in both problems can be\nfully analyzed in terms of parthood and identity. For a more thorough\noverview of the solutions to these puzzles and different theories of\nconstitution in play, see Rea (ed.) 1997 and Thomson 1998.  Questions about causation form yet a fourth important category of\nissues in the “new” metaphysics. Of course, discussion of\ncauses go back to Ancient Philosophy, featuring prominently in\nAristotle's Metaphysics and Physics. But Aristotle understood\n‘cause’ in a much broader sense than we do today. In Aristotle's\nsense, a ‘cause’ or ‘aiton’ is an explanatory condition of an\nobject—an answer to a “why” question about the\nobject. Aristotle classifies four such explanatory conditions—an\nobject's form, matter, efficient cause, and teleology. An object's\nefficient cause is the cause which explains change or motion in an\nobject. With the rise of modern physics in the seventeenth century,\ninterest in efficient causal relations became acute, and it remains so\ntoday. And when contemporary philosophers discuss problems of\ncausation, they typically mean this sense.  One major issue in the metaphysics of causation concerns\nspecifying the relata of causal relations.  Consider a\nmundane claim: an iceberg caused the Titanic to sink.  Does the causal\nrelation hold between two events: the event of the ship hitting the\niceberg and the event of the ship sinking? Or does it hold between two\nsets of states of affairs? Or does it hold between two substances, the\niceberg and the ship? Must causal relations be triadic or otherwise\npoly-adic? For example, one might think that we are always required to\nqualify a causal claim: the iceberg, rather than the captain's\nnegligence, was causally responsible for the ships foundering. And can\nabsences feature in causal relations? For example, does it make sense\nto claim that a lack of lifeboats was the cause of a third class\npassenger's death?  We might further ask whether causal relations are objective and\nirreducible features of reality. Hume famously doubted this,\ntheorizing that that our observations of causation were nothing more\nthan observations of constant conjunction. For example, perhaps we\nthink icebergs cause ships to sink only because we always observe\nship-sinking events occurring after iceberg-hitting events and not\nbecause there is a real causal relation that holds between icebergs\nand foundering ships. Contemporary metaphysicians have been attracted to other kinds of\nreductive treatments of causation. Some—like Stalnaker and\nLewis—have argued that causal relations should be understood in\nterms of counterfactual dependencies (Stalnaker 1968 and Lewis\n1973). For example, an iceberg's striking the ship caused its sinking\nat time t if and only if in the nearest possible worlds where\nthe iceberg did not strike the ship at time t, the ship did not\nsink. Others have argued that causal relations should be understood in\nterms of instantiations of laws of nature. (Davidson (1967) and\nArmstrong (1997) each defend this view albeit in different ways.) All\nof these theories expand on an idea from Hume's Treatise in\nattempting to reduce causation to different or more fundamental\ncategories. (For a more complete survey of recent theories of\ncausation, see Paul and Hall 2013.)  Debates about causation and laws of nature further give rise to a\nrelated set of pressing philosophical questions—questions of\nfreedom. In the seventeenth century, celestial mechanics gave\nphilosophers a certain picture of a way the world might be: it might\nbe a world whose future states were entirely determined by the past\nand the laws of nature (of which Newton's laws of motion and law of\nuniversal gravitation served as paradigms).  In the nineteenth century\nthe thesis that the world was indeed this way came to be called\n‘determinism’. The problem of free will can be stated as a\ndilemma. If determinism is true, there is only one physically possible\nfuture. But then how can anyone ever have acted otherwise? For, as\nCarl Ginet has said (1990: 103), our freedom can only be the freedom\nto add to the actual past; and if determinism holds, then there is\nonly one way that the given—the actual—past can be\n“added to”. But if determinism does not hold, if there are\nalternative physically possible futures, then which one comes to pass\nmust be a mere matter of chance. And if it is a mere matter of chance\nwhether I lie or tell the truth, how can it be “up to me”\nwhether I lie or tell the truth? Unless there is something wrong with\none of these two arguments, the argument for the incompatibility of\nfree will and determinism or the argument for the incompatibility of\nfree will and the falsity of determinism, free will is impossible. The\nproblem of free will may be identified with the problem of discovering\nwhether free will is possible—and, if free will is possible, the\nproblem of giving an account of free will that displays an error in\none of (or both) these arguments.  Van Inwagen (1998) defends the position that, although\nthe modern problem of free will has its origin in philosophical\nreflections on the consequences of supposing the physical universe to\nbe governed by deterministic laws, the problem cannot be evaded by\nembracing a metaphysic (like dualism or idealism) that supposes that\nagents are immaterial or non-physical. This leads into our next and\nfinal sample of topics from the “new” metaphysics.  If it is natural both to pair and to oppose time and space, it is\nalso natural to pair and to oppose the mental and the physical. The\nmodern identity theory holds that all mental events or states are a\nspecial sort of physical event or state. The theory is parsimonious\n(among its other virtues) but we nevertheless exhibit a natural\ntendency to distinguish the mental and the physical. Perhaps the\nreason for this is epistemological: whether our thoughts and\nsensations are physical or not, the kind of awareness we have of them\nis of a radically different sort from the kind of awareness we have of\nthe flight of a bird or of a flowing stream, and it seems to be\nnatural to infer that the objects of the one sort of awareness are\nradically different from the objects of the other. That the inference\nis logically invalid is (as is so often the case) no barrier to its\nbeing made. Whatever the reason may be, philosophers have generally\n(but not universally) supposed that the world of concrete particulars\ncan be divided into two very different realms, the mental and the\nmaterial. (As the twentieth century passed and physical theory\nrendered “matter” an increasingly problematical concept,\nit became increasingly common to say “the mental and the\nphysical”.) If one takes this view of things, one faces\nphilosophical problems that modern philosophy has assigned to\nmetaphysics.  Prominent among these is the problem of accounting for mental\ncausation. If thoughts and sensations belong to an immaterial or\nnon-physical portion of reality—if, for example, they are\nchanges in immaterial or non-physical substances—how can they\nhave effects in the physical world?  How, for example, can a decision\nor act of will cause a movement of a human body? How, for that matter,\ncan changes in the physical world have effects in the non-physical\npart of reality? If one's feeling pain is a non-physical event, how\ncan a physical injury to one's body cause one to feel pain? Both\nquestions have troubled “two realm” philosophers—or\n‘dualists’, to give them their more usual name. But the former has\ntroubled them more, since modern physics is founded on principles that\nassert the conservation of various physical quantities. If a\nnon-physical event causes a change in the physical\nworld—dualists are repeatedly asked—does that not imply\nthat physical quantities like energy or momentum fail to be conserved\nin any physically closed causal system in which that change occurs?\nAnd does that not imply that every voluntary movement of a human body\ninvolves a violation of the laws of physics—that is to say, a\nmiracle?  A wide range of metaphysical theories have been generated by the\nattempts of dualists to answer these questions. Some have been less\nthan successful for reasons that are not of much intrinsic\nphilosophical interest. C. D.  Broad, for example, proposed (1925:\n103–113) that the mind affects the body by momentarily changing\nthe electrical resistance of certain synapses in the brain, (thus\ndiverting various current pulses, which literally follow the\npath of least resistance into paths other than those they\nwould have taken). And this, he supposed, would not imply a violation\nof the principle of the conservation of energy. But it seems\nimpossible to suppose that an agent could change the electrical\nresistance of a physical system without expending energy in the\nprocess, for to do this would necessitate changing the physical\nstructure of the system, and that implies changing the positions of\nbits of matter on which forces are acting (think of turning the knob\non a rheostat or variable resistor: one must expend energy to do\nthis). If this example has any philosophical interest it is this: it\nillustrates the fact that it is impossible to imagine a way for a\nnon-physical thing to affect the behavior of a (classical) physical\nsystem without violating a conservation principle.  The various dualistic theories of the mind treat the\ninteraction problem in different ways. The theory called\n‘dualistic interactionism’ does not, of itself, have\nanything to say about the problem—although its various\nproponents (Broad, for example) have proposed solutions to\nit. ‘Occasionalism’ simply concedes that the “local”\ncounterfactual dependence of the behavior of a physical system on a\nnon-physical event requires a miracle. The theory of pre-established\nharmony, which substitutes “global” for local\ncounterfactual dependence of voluntary physical movements on the\nmental states of agents, avoids problems with conservation\nprinciples—but secures this advantage at a great price. (Like\noccasionalism, it presupposes theism, and, unlike occasionalism, it\nentails either that free will does not exist or that free will is\ncompatible with determinism.) ‘Epiphenomenalism’ simply denies that the\nmental can affect the physical, and contents itself with an\nexplanation of why the mental appears to affect the physical.  In addition to these dualistic theories, there are monistic\ntheories, theories that dissolve the interaction problem by denying\nthe existence of either the physical or the non-physical: idealism and\nphysicalism.  (Present-day philosophers for the most part prefer the\nterm ‘physicalism’ to the older term\n‘materialism’ for reasons noted above.) Most current work\nin the philosophy of mind presupposes physicalism, and it is generally\nagreed that a physicalistic theory that does not simply deny the\nreality of the mental (that is not an “eliminativist”\ntheory), raises metaphysical questions. Such a theory must, of course,\nfind a place for the mental in a wholly physical world, and such a\nplace exists only if mental events and states are certain special\nphysical events and states. There are at least three important\nmetaphysical questions raised by these theories. First, granted that\nall particular mental events or states are identical with particular\nphysical events or states, can it also be that some or all mental\nuniversals (‘event-types’ and ‘state-types’\nare the usual terms) are identical with physical universals? Secondly,\ndoes physicalism imply that mental events and states cannot really be\ncauses (does physicalism imply a kind of epiphenomenalism)? Thirdly,\ncan a physical thing have non-physical properties—might it be\nthat mental properties like “thinking of Vienna” or\n“perceiving redly” are non-physical properties of physical\norganisms? This last question, of course, raises a more basic\nmetaphysical question, ‘What is a non-physical property?’\nAnd all forms of the identity theory raise fundamental metaphysical\nquestions, ontological questions, questions like, ‘What is an\nevent?’ and ‘What is a state?’.  As is obvious from the discussion\nin Section 3, the scope of metaphysics has\nexpanded beyond the tidy boundaries Aristotle drew. So how should we\nanswer our original question? Is contemporary metaphysics just a\ncompendium of philosophical problems that cannot be assigned to\nepistemology or logic or ethics or aesthetics or to any of the parts\nof philosophy that have relatively clear definitions? Or is there a\ncommon theme that unites work on these disparate problems and\ndistinguishes contemporary metaphysics from other areas of\ninquiry?   These issues concerning the nature of metaphysics are further\nconnected with issues about the epistemic status of various\nmetaphysical theories. Aristotle and most of the Medievals took it for\ngranted that, at least in its most fundamental aspects, the ordinary\nperson's picture of the world is “correct as far as it\ngoes”. But many post-Medieval metaphysicians have refused to\ntake this for granted. Some of them, in fact, have been willing to\ndefend the thesis that the world is very different from, perhaps\nradically different from, the way people thought it was before they\nbegan to reason philosophically. For example, in response to the\npuzzles of coincidence considered in Section\n3.3, some metaphysicians have maintained that there are no objects\nwith proper parts. This entails that composite objects—tables,\nchairs, cats, and so on—do not exist, a somewhat startling\nview. And as we saw in Section 3.1, other\nmetaphysicians have been happy to postulate the reality of concrete\nmerely possible worlds if this posit makes for a simpler and more\nexplanatorily powerful theory of modality. Perhaps this contemporary\nopenness to “revisionary” metaphysics is simply a recovery\nof or a reversion to a pre-Aristotelian conception of a\n“permissible metaphysical conclusion”, a conception that\nis illustrated by Zeno's arguments against the reality of motion and\nPlato's Allegory of the Cave. But no matter how we classify it, the\nsurprising nature of many contemporary metaphysical claims puts\nadditional pressure on practioners to explain just what they are up\nto. They raise questions of the methodology of metaphysics.  One attractive strategy for answering these questions emphasizes\nthe continuity of metaphysics with science.  On this conception,\nmetaphysics is primarily or exclusively concerned with developing\ngeneralizations from our best-confirmed scientific theories. For\nexample, in the mid-twentieth century, Quine (1948) proposed that that\nthe “old/intermediate” metaphysical debate over the status\nof abstract objects should be settled in this way. He observed that if\nour best scientific theories are recast in the “canonical\nnotation of (first-order) quantification” (in sufficient depth\nthat all the inferences that users of these theories will want to make\nare valid in first-order logic), then many of these theories, if not\nall of them, will have as a logical consequence the existential\ngeneralization on a predicate \\(F\\) such that \\(F\\) is satisfied only by\nabstract objects. It would seem, therefore, that our best scientific\ntheories “carry ontological commitment” to objects whose\nexistence is denied by nominalism.  (These objects may not be\nuniversals in the classical sense. They may, for example, be sets.)\nTake for example the simple theory, ‘There are homogeneous\nobjects, and the mass of a homogeneous object in grams is the product\nof its density in grams per cubic centimeter and its volume in cubic\ncentimeters’. A typical recasting of this theory\nin the canonical notation of quantification is: (‘\\(Hx\\)’: ‘\\(x\\) is homogeneous’;\n‘\\(Mx\\)’: ‘the mass of \\(x\\) in grams’;\n‘\\(Dx\\)’: ‘the density of \\(x\\) in grams per cubic\ncentimeter’; ‘\\(Vx\\)’: ‘the volume of \\(x\\) in\ncubic centimeters’.) A first-order logical consequence of this\n“theory” is That is: there exists at least one thing that is a product (at\nleast one thing that, for some \\(x\\) and some \\(y\\) is the product of \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\)). And a product must be a number, for the\noperation “product of” applies only to numbers. Our little\ntheory, at least if it is recast in the way shown above,\nis therefore, in a very obvious sense, “committed” to the\nexistence of numbers. It would seem, therefore, that a nominalist\ncannot consistently affirm that theory. (In this example, the role\nplayed by ‘the predicate F’ in the abstract\nstatement of Quine's “observation” is played by the\npredicate ‘…=…×…’.) Quine's work on nominalism inspired a much broader program for\napproaching ontological questions. According to\n“neo-Quineans”, questions about the existence of abstract\nobjects, mental events, objects with proper parts, temporal parts, and\neven other concrete possible worlds are united to the extent that they\nare questions about the ontological machinery required to account for\nthe truth of our best-confirmed theories. Still, many questions of the\nnew and old metaphysics are not questions of ontology. For example,\nmany participants in the debate over causation are not particularly\nworried about whether causes and effects exist. Rather, they want to\nknow “in virtue of what” something is a cause or\neffect. Few involved in the debate over the mental and physical are\ninterested in the question whether there are mental properties (in\nsome sense or other).  Rather, they are interested in whether mental\nproperties are “basic” or sui generis—or\nwhether they are grounded, partially or fully, in physical\nproperties.  Is there a unified methodology for metaphysics more broadly\nunderstood? Some think the task of the metaphysician is to identify\nand argue for explanatory relations of various kinds. According to\nFine (2001), metaphysicians are in the business of providing theories\nof which facts or propositions ground other facts or propositions, and\nwhich facts or propositions hold “in reality”. For\nexample, a philosopher might hold that tables and other composite\nobjects exist, but think that facts about tables are completely\ngrounded in facts about the arrangements of point particles or facts\nabout the state of a wave function. This metaphysician would hold that\nthere are no facts about tables “in reality”; rather, there are\nfacts about arrangements of particles.  Schaffer 2010 proposes a\nsimilar view, but holds that metaphysical grounding relations hold not\nbetween facts but between entities.  According to Schaffer, the\nfundamental entity/entities should be understood as the\nentity/entities that grounds/ground all others.  On Schaffer's\nconception we can meaningfully ask whether a table is grounded in its\nparts or vice versa. We can even theorize (as Schaffer does) that the\nworld as a whole is the ultimate ground for everything.  Another noteworthy approach (Sider 2012) holds that the task of the\nmetaphysician is to “explain the world” in terms of its\nfundamental structure. For Sider, what unites (good) metaphysics as a\ndiscipline is that its theories are all framed in terms that pick out\nthe fundamental structure of the world. For example, according to\nSider we may understand ‘causal nihilism’ as the view that\ncausal relations do not feature in the fundamental structure of the\nworld, and so the best language for describing the world will eschew\ncausal predicates.  It should be emphasized that these ways of delimiting metaphysics\ndo not presuppose that all of the topics we've considered as examples\nof metaphysics are substantive or important to the subject. Consider\nthe debate about modality. Quine (1953) and Sider (2012) both argue\nfrom their respective theories about the nature of metaphysics that\naspects of the debate over the correct metaphysical theory of\nmodality are misguided. Others are skeptical of the debates about\ncomposition or persistence through time. So theories about the nature\nof metaphysics might give us new resources for criticizing particular\nfirst-order debates that have historically been considered\nmetaphysical, and it is common practice for metaphysicians to regard\nsome debates as substantive while adopting a deflationist attitude\nabout others.  It may also be that there is no internal unity to metaphysics.\nMore strongly, perhaps there is no such thing as metaphysics—or\nat least nothing that deserves to be called a science or a study or a\ndiscipline.  Perhaps, as some philosophers have proposed, no\nmetaphysical statement or theory is either true or false. Or perhaps,\nas others have proposed, metaphysical theories have truth-values, but\nit is impossible to find out what they are. At least since the time of\nHume, there have been philosophers who have proposed that metaphysics\nis “impossible”—either because its questions are\nmeaningless or because they are impossible to answer. The remainder of\nthis entry will be a discussion of some recent arguments for the\nimpossibility of metaphysics. Let us suppose that we are confident that we are able to identify\nevery statement as either “a metaphysical statement” or\n“not a metaphysical statement”. (We need not suppose that\nthis ability is grounded in some non-trivial definition or account of\nmetaphysics.) Let us call the thesis that all metaphysical statements\nare meaningless “the strong form” of the thesis that\nmetaphysics is impossible. (At one time, an enemy of metaphysics might\nhave been content to say that all metaphysical statements were false.\nBut this is obviously not a possible thesis if the denial of a\nmetaphysical statement must itself be a metaphysical statement) And\nlet us call the following statement the “weak form” of the\nthesis that metaphysics is impossible: metaphysical statements are\nmeaningful, but human beings can never discover whether any\nmetaphysical statement is true or false (or probable or improbable or\nwarranted or unwarranted).  Let us briefly examine an example of the strong form of the thesis\nthat metaphysics is impossible. The logical positivists maintained\nthat the meaning of a (non-analytic) statement consisted entirely in\nthe predictions it made about possible experience. They maintained,\nfurther, that metaphysical statements (which were obviously not put\nforward as analytic truths) made no predictions about\nexperience. Therefore, they concluded, metaphysical statements are\nmeaningless—or, better, the “statements” we classify\nas metaphysical are not really statements at all: they are things that\nlook like statements but aren't, rather as mannequins are things that\nlook like human beings but aren't.  But (many philosophers asked) how does the logical positivist's\ncentral thesis fare by its own standards? Does this thesis make any predictions\nabout possible experiences? Could some observation show that it was\ntrue? Could some experiment show that it was false? It would seem not.\nIt would seem that everything in the world would look the\nsame—like this—whether this thesis was true or\nfalse. (Will the positivist reply that the offset sentence is\nanalytic? This reply is problematic in that it implies that the\nmultitude of native speakers of English who reject the logical\npositivists' account of meaning somehow cannot see that that sentence\nis true in virtue of the meaning of the word\n“meaning”—which is no technical term but a word of\nordinary English.) And, therefore, if the statement is true it is\nmeaningless; or, what is the same thing, if it is meaningful, it is\nfalse. Logical positivism would therefore seem to say of itself that\nit is false or meaningless; it would be seem to be, to use a currently\nfashionable phrase, “self-referentially incoherent”.  Current advocates of ‘metaphysical anti-realism’ also\nadvocate a strong form of the thesis that metaphysics is\nimpossible. Insofar as it is possible to find a coherent line of\nargument in the writings of any anti-realist, it is hard to see why\nthey, like the logical positivists, are not open to a charge of\nself-referential incoherency. Indeed, there is much to be said for the\nconclusion that all forms of the strong thesis fall prey to\nself-referential incoherency. Put very abstractly, the case against\nproponents of the strong thesis may be put like this.  Dr. McZed, a\n“strong anti-metaphysician”, contends that any piece of\ntext that does not pass some test she specifies is meaningless (if she\nis typical of strong anti-metaphysicians, she will say that any text\nthat fails the test represents an attempt to use language in a way in\nwhich language cannot be used). And she contends further that any\npiece of text that can plausibly be identified as\n“metaphysical” must fail this test. But it invariably\nturns out that various sentences that are essential components of\nMcZed's case against metaphysics themselves fail to pass her test. A\ntest-case for this very schematic and abstract refutation of all\nrefutations of metaphysics is the very sophisticated and subtle\ncritique of metaphysics (it purports to apply only to the kind of\nmetaphysics exemplified by the seventeenth-century rationalists and\ncurrent analytical metaphysics) presented in van Fraassen 2002. It\nis a defensible position that van Fraassen's case against metaphysics\ndepends essentially on certain theses that, although they are not\nthemselves metaphysical theses, are nevertheless open to many of the\ncriticisms he brings against metaphysical theses.  The weak form of the thesis that metaphysics is impossible is\nthis: there is something about the human mind (perhaps even the minds\nof all rational agents or all finite rational agents) that unfits it\nfor reaching metaphysical conclusions in any reliable way. This idea\nis at least as old as Kant, but a version of it that is much more\nmodest than Kant's (and much easier to understand) has been carefully\npresented in McGinn 1993. McGinn's argument for the conclusion that\nthe human mind is (as a matter of evolutionary contingency, and not\nsimply because it is “a mind”) incapable of a satisfactory\ntreatment of a large range of philosophical questions (a range that\nincludes all metaphysical questions), however, depends on speculative\nfactual theses about human cognitive capacities that are in principle\nsubject to empirical refutation and which are at present without\nsignificant empirical support.
