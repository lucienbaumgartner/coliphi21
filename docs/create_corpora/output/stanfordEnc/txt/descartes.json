During the course of his life, he was a mathematician\nfirst, a natural scientist or “natural philosopher” second, and a\nmetaphysician third. In mathematics, he developed the techniques that\nmade possible algebraic (or “analytic”) geometry. In natural\nphilosophy, he can be credited with several specific achievements:\nco-framer of the sine law of refraction, developer of an important\nempirical account of the rainbow, and proposer of a naturalistic\naccount of the formation of the earth and planets (a precursor to the\nnebular hypothesis). More importantly, he offered a new vision of the\nnatural world that continues to shape our thought today: a world of\nmatter possessing a few fundamental properties and interacting\naccording to a few universal laws. This natural world included an\nimmaterial mind that, in human beings, was directly related to the\nbrain; in this way, Descartes formulated the modern version of the\nmind–body problem. In metaphysics, he provided arguments for the\nexistence of God, to show that the essence of matter is extension, and\nthat the essence of mind is thought. Descartes claimed early on to\npossess a special method, which was variously exhibited in mathematics,\nnatural philosophy, and metaphysics, and which, in the latter part of\nhis life, included, or was supplemented by, a method of doubt.\n\n\n\nDescartes presented his results in major works published during his\nlifetime: the Discourse on the Method (in French, 1637), with\nits essays, the Dioptrics, Meteorology, and\nGeometry; the Meditations on First Philosophy (i.e.,\non metaphysics), with its Objections and Replies (in Latin,\n1641, 2nd edn. 1642); the Principles of Philosophy, covering his metaphysics\nand much of his natural philosophy (in Latin, 1644); and the\nPassions of the Soul, on the emotions (in French, 1649).\nImportant works published posthumously included his Letters\n(in Latin and French, 1657–67); World, or Treatise on\nLight, containing the core of his natural philosophy (in French,\n1664); Treatise on Man (in French, 1664), containing his\nphysiology and mechanistic psychology; and the Rules for the\nDirection of the Mind (in Latin, 1701), an early, unfinished work\nattempting to set out his method.\n\n\n\nDescartes was known among the learned in his day as a top\nmathematician, as the developer of a new and comprehensive physics or\ntheory of nature (including living things), and as the proposer of a\nnew metaphysics. In the years following his death, his natural\nphilosophy was widely taught and discussed. In the eighteenth century\naspects of his science remained influential, especially his\nphysiology, as did his project of investigating the knower in\nassessing the possibility and extent of human knowledge; he was also\nremembered for his failed metaphysics and his use of skeptical\narguments for doubting. In the nineteenth century he was revered for\nhis mechanistic physiology and theory that animal bodies are machines\n(that is, are constituted by material mechanisms, governed by the laws\nof matter alone). The twentieth century variously celebrated his\nfamous “cogito” starting point, reviled the sense data\nthat some alleged to be the legacy of his skeptical starting point,\nand looked to him as a model of the culturally engaged philosopher. He\nhas been seen, at various times, as a hero and as a villain; as a\nbrilliant theorist who set new directions in thought, and as the\nharbinger of a cold, rationalistic, and calculative conception of\nhuman beings. Those new to the study of Descartes should engage his\nown works in some detail prior to developing a view of his legacy.\n\n\n\nDescartes was born on 31 March 1596 in his maternal grandmother's house in\nLa Haye, in the Touraine region of France. His father Joachim, a lawyer\nwho lived in Châtellerault (22 kilometers southwest of La Haye,\nacross the Creuse River in the Poitou region), was away at the\nParliament of Brittany in Rennes. The town of La Haye, which lies 47\nkilometers south of Tours, has subsequently been renamed Descartes.  \n\nWhen Descartes was thirteen and one-half months old, his mother,\nJeanne Brochard, died in childbirth. The young René spent his\nfirst years with his grandmother, Jeanne Sain Brochard, in La Haye,\ntogether with his older brother Pierre and older sister Jeanne. It is\nlikely that he then moved to the house of his great uncle, Michel\nFerrand, who, like many of René's male relatives, \nwas a lawyer,\nand who was Counselor to the King in Châtellerault. When\nDescartes met Isaac Beeckman in 1618, Descartes introduced himself as\n“Poitevin,” or from Poitou (10:46, 51–4;\nRodis-Lewis 1998, 26; see also 2:642). At this time (and now\nand again later on), he signed letters as “du Perron” and\ncalled himself “sieur du Perron” (Lord of Perron), after a\nsmall farm in Poitou he had inherited from his mother's family (Watson\n2007, 81, 230). But he did not neglect his birth place in La Haye: in\na letter of 1649, he described himself as “a man who was born in\nthe gardens of Touraine” (5:349). \n\nIn 1606 or 1607, Descartes entered the newly founded Jesuit College\nof La Flèche, where he remained until 1614 or 1615. He \nfollowed the usual course of studies, which included five or six years of grammar\nschool, including Latin and Greek grammar, classical poets, and Cicero,\nfollowed by three years of philosophy curriculum. By rule, the Jesuit philosophy \ncurriculum followed Aristotle; it was divided into\nthe then-standard topics of logic, morals, physics, and metaphysics.\nThe Jesuits also included mathematics in the final three years of\nstudy. \n\nAristotle's philosophy was approached through textbook presentations\nand commentaries on Aristotle's works. Aristotle himself frequently\ndiscussed the positions of his ancient predecessors. The most\nextensive commentaries also elaborated in some detail on positions\nother than Aristotle's. Within this framework, and taking into account\nthe reading of Cicero, Descartes would have been exposed in school to\nthe doctrines of the ancient atomists, Plato, and the Stoics, and he\nwould have heard of the skeptics. Further, important intellectual\nevents were known at La Flèche, including the discovery of the\nmoons of Jupiter by Galileo in 1610. Hence, although scholastic\nAristotelian philosophy was dominant in his school years, it was not\nthe only type of philosophy that he knew. \n\nFamously, Descartes wrote in the autobiographical portion of the\nDiscourse (1637) that, when he left school, “I found\nmyself beset by so many doubts and errors that I came to think I had\ngained nothing from my attempts to become educated but increasing\nrecognition of my ignorance” (6:4). And yet in the next\nparagraph he allowed that he did not “cease to value the\nexercises done in the schools” (6:5), for languages, fables,\noratory, poetry, mathematics, morals, theology, and philosophy all had\ntheir value, as did jurisprudence, medicine, and the other sciences\n(including engineering), which serve as professions and which one\nmight study after attending a school such as La Flèche. He went\non to note the contradiction and disagreement that beset philosophy\nand so infected the higher sciences (including medicine)\n“insofar as they borrow their principles from philosophy”\n(6:8). A year later, in 1638, he advised an inquiring father that\n“nowhere on earth is philosophy taught better than at La\nFlèche,” where he advised his correspondent to send his\nson even if he wanted him subsequently to transcend the learning of\nthe schools—while also suggesting that the son might study at\nUtrecht with Henry le Roy, a disciple of Descartes\n(2:378–9). Descartes was, in the\nDiscourse, suggesting that it was no accident that the\nphilosophy he learned at La Flèche was uncertain: previous \nphilosophy was bound to be uncertain, since he (Descartes) was now offering a\nfirst glimpse of the one true philosophy that he had only recently\ndiscovered. Until it could be promulgated, La Flèche, \nor another good school, would be the best on offer. \n\nHis family wanted Descartes to be a lawyer, like his father and many\nother relatives. To this end, he went to Poitiers to study law, \nobtaining a degree in 1616. But he never practiced law or entered into\nthe governmental service such practice would make \npossible (Rodis-Lewis 1998, 18–22). Instead, he\nbecame a gentleman soldier, moving in 1618 to Breda, to support the\nProtestant Prince Maurice against the Catholic parts of the Netherlands\n(which parts later formed Belgium), which were controlled \nby Spain—a Catholic land,\nlike France, but at this point an enemy. \nWhile in Breda, Descartes met Isaac Beeckman, a Dutch mathematician\nand natural philosopher. Beeckman set various problems for Descartes,\nincluding questions about falling bodies, hydrostatics, and\nmathematical problems. Descartes and Beeckman engaged in what they\ncalled “physico-mathematica,” or mathematical\nphysics (10:52).  Since antiquity, mathematics had been\napplied to various physical subject matters, in optics, astronomy,\nmechanics (focusing on the lever), and hydrostatics. Beeckman and\nDescartes brought to this work a commitment to atoms as the basic\nconstituents of matter; as had ancient atomists, they attributed not\nonly size, shape, and motion but also weight to those\natoms (10:68). Descartes opened a section in his notebook\nentitled “Democritica” (10:8), in honor of the\nancient atomist Democritus. \n\nAt this time, Descartes discovered and conveyed to Beeckman the\nfundamental insight that makes analytic geometry possible: the\ntechnique for describing lines of all sorts by using mathematical\nequations involving ratios between lengths. Descartes himself did not\nforesee replacing geometrical constructions with algebraic formulas;\nrather, he viewed geometry as the basic mathematical science and he\nconsidered his algebraic techniques to provide a powerful alternative\nto actual compass-and-ruler constructions when the latter became too\nintricate. When, in the nineteenth century, algebra and analysis took\nprecedence over geometry, the rectilinear coordinate system of\nalgebraic geometry came to be called “Cartesian\ncoordinates” in honor of Descartes' discovery. \n\nDescartes left Breda in 1619 to join the Catholic army of Maximilian\nI (Duke of Bavaria and ally of France). The war concerned the authority\nof Ferdinand V, a Catholic, who had been crowned emperor of the Holy\nRoman Empire in September. Descartes attended the coronation and was\nreturning to the army when winter caught him in the small town of Ulm\n(or perhaps Neuburg), not far from Munich. On the night of November 10,\n1619, Descartes had three dreams that seemed to provide him with a\nmission in life. The dreams themselves are interesting and complex (see\nSebba 1987). Descartes took from them the message that he should set\nout to reform all knowledge. He decided to begin with philosophy, since\nthe principles of the other sciences must be derived from it\n(6:21–2). Descartes was familiar with both mainstream philosophy and recent\ninnovators (those who, among other things, rejected aspects of\nAristotle's philosophy), including reading that he did from 1620\non. In 1640, he recalled (3:185) having read various works in\nphilosophy around the year 1620, written by well-known commentators on\nAristotle: Francisco Toledo (1532–96), Antonio Rubio\n(1548–1615), and the Coimbran commentators (active ca. 1600),\ntogether with an abstract or summary of “the whole of scholastic\nphilosophy” by Eustace of Saint Paul (1573–1640),\nwhose Summa Philosophiae was first published in 1609. In\n1638, he recalled having read Thomas Campanella's De Sensu\nRerum (1620) about fifteen years before, and not being much\nimpressed (2:659–60). And in 1630 he was able to rattle off the\nnames of recent innovators in philosophy (1:158), including Campanella\n(1568–1639), Bernardino Telesio (1509–88), Giordano Bruno\n(1548–1600), Lucilio Vanini (1585–1619), and Sébastien\nBasson (b. ca. 1573). \n\nDescartes' activities during the early 1620s are not\nwell-documented. He was in France part of the time, visiting Poitou to sell\nsome inherited properties in 1622 and visiting Paris. He went to Italy\n(1623–25). Upon his return he lived in Paris, \nwhere he was in touch with\nmathematicians and natural philosophers in the circle of his long-time\nfriend and correspondent \nMarin Mersenne (1588–1648). While in Paris,\nhe worked on some mathematical problems and derived the sine law of\nrefraction, which facilitated his work on formulating mathematically the shapes\nof lenses (later published in the Dioptrics). His major philosophical\neffort during these years was on the Rules, \na work to convey his new method. \n\nIn the Rules, he sought to generalize the methods of\nmathematics so as to provide a route to clear knowledge of everything\nthat human beings can know. His methodological advice included a\nsuggestion that is familiar to every student of elementary geometry:\nbreak your work up into small steps that you can understand completely\nand about which you have utter certainty, and check your work often.\nBut he also had advice for the ambitious seeker of truth, concerning\nwhere to start and how to work up to greater things. Thus, Rule 10\nreads: “In order to acquire discernment we should exercise our\nintelligence by investigating what others have already discovered, and\nmethodically survey even the most insignificant products of human\nskill, especially those which display order” (10:403). As\nexamples of “simple” arts “in which order\nprevails,” he offered carpet-making and embroidery, and also\nnumber-games and arithmetic games. He went on to discuss the roles of\nthe “cognitive faculties” in acquiring knowledge, which\ninclude the intellect, imagination, sense perception, and memory.\nThese faculties allow the seeker of knowledge to combine simple truths\nin order to solve more complex problems, such as the solution to\nproblems in optics (10:394), or the discovery of how a magnet works\n(10:427). \n\nBy the end of 1628, Descartes had abandoned work on the\nRules, having completed about half of the projected treatise.\nIn that year he moved to the Dutch Netherlands, and after that he\nreturned to France infrequently, prior to moving to Sweden in 1649.\nWhile in the Netherlands, he endeavored to keep his address a secret\nand he changed locations frequently, in accordance with his motto, \n“who lives well hidden, \nlives well” (1:286*). \nUpon arriving in the Netherlands, Descartes undertook work on two sorts\nof topics. In Summer, 1629, an impressive set of parhelia, or false\nsuns, were observed near Rome. When Descartes heard of them, he set out\nto find an explanation. (He ultimately hypothesized that a large, solid\nice-ring in the sky acts as a lens to form multiple images of the sun\n[6:355].) This work interrupted his investigations on another topic,\nwhich had engaged him for his first nine months in the Netherlands\n(1:44)—the topic of metaphysics, that is, the theory of the first\nprinciples of everything that there is. The metaphysical objects of\ninvestigation included the existence and nature of God and the soul\n(1:144, 182). However, these metaphysical investigations were not\nentirely divorced from problems such as the parhelia, for he claimed\nthat through his investigations into God and the human self, he had\nbeen able “to discover the foundation of physics” (1:144).\nSubsequently, Descartes mentioned a little metaphysical treatise in\nLatin—presumably an early version of the\nMeditations—that he wrote upon first coming to the\nNetherlands (1:184, 350). And we know that Descartes later confided to\nMersenne that the Meditations contained “all the principles of\nmy physics” (3:233). \n\nWhile working on the parhelia, Descartes conceived the idea for a\nvery ambitious treatise. He wrote to Mersenne that he had decided not\nto explain “just one phenomenon” (the parhelia), but rather to compose\na treatise in which he explained “all the phenomena of nature, that is\nto say, the whole of physics” (1:70). This work eventually became\nThe World, which was to have had three parts: on light (a\ngeneral treatise on visible, or material, nature), on man (a treatise\nof physiology), and on the soul. Only the first two survive (and\nperhaps only they were ever written), as the Treatise on Light\nand Treatise on Man. In these works, which Descartes decided\nto suppress upon learning of the condemnation of Galileo (1:270, 305),\nhe offered a comprehensive vision of the universe as constituted from a\nbare form of matter having only length, breadth, and depth\n(three-dimensional volume) and carved up into particles with size and\nshape, which may be in motion or at rest, and which interact through\nlaws of motion enforced by God (11:33–4). These works contained a\ndescription of the visible universe as a single physical system in\nwhich all its operations, from the formation of planets and the\ntransmission of light from the sun, to the physiological processes of\nhuman and nonhuman animal bodies, can be explained through the\nmechanism of matter arranged into shapes and structures and\nmoving according to three laws of motion. In fact,\nhis explanations in the World and the subsequent Principles\nmade little use of the three laws of motion in other than a \nqualitative manner. The laws sustained the notion that\nmatter moves regularly (in a straight line) and that upon impact bits of matter \nalter their motions in regular ways—something that\nhappens constantly in the full universe (the \n“plenum”) conceived \nby Descartes. \n\nAfter suppressing his World, Descartes decided to put\nforward, anonymously, a limited sample of his new philosophy, in the\nDiscourse with its attached essays. The Discourse\nrecounted Descartes' own life journey, \nexplaining how he had come to\nthe position of doubting his previous knowledge and seeking to begin\nafresh. It offered some initial results of his metaphysical\ninvestigations, including mind–body dualism. It did not, however,\nengage in the deep skepticism of the later Meditations, nor\ndid it claim to establish, metaphysically, that the essence of matter\nis extension. This last conclusion was presented merely as a hypothesis\nwhose fruitfulness could be tested and proven by way of its results, as\ncontained in the attached essays on Dioptrics and\nMeteorology. The latter subject area comprised\n“atmospheric” phenomena. In his Meteorology,\nDescartes described his general hypothesis about the nature of matter,\nbefore continuing on to provide accounts of vapors, salt, winds,\nclouds, snow, rain, hail, lightning, the rainbow, coronas, and\nparhelia. \n\nDescartes wrote in the Meteorology that\nhe was working from the following “supposition” or\nhypothesis: “that the water, earth, air, and all other such\nbodies that surround us are composed of many small parts of various\nshapes and sizes, which are never so properly disposed nor so exactly\njoined together that there do not remain many intervals around them;\nand that these intervals are not empty but are filled with that\nextremely subtle matter through the mediation of which, I have said\nabove, the action of light is communicated” (6:233). He\npresented a corpuscularian basis for his physics, which denied the\natoms-and-void theory of ancient atomism and affirmed that all bodies\nare composed from one type of matter, which is infinitely divisible\n(6:239). In the World, he had presented his non-atomistic\ncorpuscularism, but without denying void space outright and without\naffirming infinite divisibility (11:12–20). \n\nIn the Meteorology, he also proclaimed that his natural\nphilosophy had no need for the “substantial forms” and\n“real qualities” that other philosophers “imagine to\nbe in bodies” (6:239). He had taken the same position in\nthe World, where he said that in conceiving his new\n“world” (i.e., his conception of the universe), “I\ndo not use the qualities called heat, cold, moistness, and dryness, as\nthe Philosophers do” (11:25). Indeed, Descartes claimed that he\ncould explain these qualities themselves through matter in motion\n(11:26), a claim that he repeated in the Meteorology\n(6:235–6). In effect, he was denying the then-dominant\nscholastic Aristotelian ontology, which explained all natural bodies\nas comprised of a “prime matter” informed by a\n“substantial form,” and which explained qualities such as\nhot and cold as really inhering in bodies in a way that is\n“similar” to the qualities of hot and cold as we\nexperience them tactually. \n\nUnlike Descartes' purely extended matter, which can exist on its own\nhaving only size and shape, many scholastic Aristotelians held that\nprime matter cannot exist on its own. To form a substance, or\nsomething that can exist by itself, prime matter must be\n“informed” by a substantial form (a form that renders\nsomething into a substance). The four Aristotelian elements, earth,\nair, fire, and water, had substantial forms that combined the basic\nqualities of hot, cold, wet, and dry: earth is cold and dry; air is\nhot and wet; fire is hot and dry; and water is cold and wet. These\nelements can themselves then serve as “matter” to higher\nsubstantial forms, such as the form of a mineral, or a magnet, or a\nliving thing. Whether in the case of earth or of a living rabbit, the\n“form” of a thing directs its characteristic activity. For\nearth, that activity is to approach the center to the universe; water\nhas the same tendency, but not as strongly. For this reason,\nAristotelians explained, the planet earth has formed at the center,\nwith water on its surface. A new rabbit is formed when a male rabbit\ncontributes, through its seed-matter, the “form” of\nrabbithood to the seed-matter of the female rabbit. This form then\norganizes that matter into the shape of a rabbit, including\norganizing and directing the activity of its various organs and\nphysiological processes. The newborn rabbit's behavior is then guided\nby its rabbit-specific “sensitive soul,” which is the name\nfor the substantial form of the rabbit. Other properties of the\nrabbit, such as the whiteness of its fur, are explained by the\n“real quality” of white inhering in each strand of\nhair. \n\nAlthough in the World and Meteorology Descartes\navoided outright denial of substantial forms and real qualities, it is\nclear that he intended to deny them (1:324; 2:200; 3:420, 500, 648).\nTwo considerations help explain his tentative language: first, when he\nwrote these works, he was not yet prepared to release his metaphysics,\nwhich would support his hypothesis about matter and so rule out\nsubstantial forms (1:563); and, second, he was sensitive to the\nprudential value of not directly attacking the scholastic Aristotelian\nposition (3:298), since it was the accepted position in university\neducation (3:577) and was strongly supported by orthodox theologians,\nboth Catholic and Protestant (1:85–6; 3:349). \n\nAfter publication of the Discourse in 1637, Descartes\nreceived in his correspondence queries and challenges to various of the\ndoctrines, including his account of the sequence of phenomena during\nheart-beat and the circulation of the blood; his avoidance of\nsubstantial forms and real qualities; his argument for a distinction\nbetween mind and body; and his view that natural philosophical\nhypotheses could be “proven” \nthrough the effects that they explain\n(6:76). Descartes' correspondence from the \nsecond half of the 1630s repays close study, among other things for \nhis discussions of hypothesis-confirmation in science, his replies to objections\nconcerning his metaphysics, and his explanation that he had left the\nmost radical skeptical arguments out of this work, since it was written\nin French for a wide audience (1:350, 561). \n\nIn 1635, Descartes fathered a daughter named Francine. Her mother\nwas Descartes' housekeeper, Helena Jans. They lived with \nDescartes part of the time in the latter 1630s, \nand Descartes was arranging for them to join him when he learned\nof Francine's untimely death in September 1640.\nDescartes subsequently contributed a dowry for Helena's marriage in\n1644 (Watson 2007, 188). \nIn a letter of 13 November 1639, Descartes wrote to Mersenne that he\nwas “working on a discourse in which I try to clarify what I have\nhitherto written” on metaphysics (2:622). This was the\nMeditations, and presumably he was revising or recasting the\nLatin treatise from 1629. He announced to Mersenne a plan to put the\nwork before “the twenty or thirty most learned theologians” before it\nwas published. In the end, he and Mersenne collected seven sets of\nobjections to the Meditations, which Descartes published\nwith the work, along with his replies (1641, 1642). Some objections were from\nunnamed theologians, passed on by Mersenne; one set came from the\nDutch priest Johannes Caterus; one set was from the Jesuit philosopher Pierre Bourdin;\nothers were from Mersenne himself, from the philosophers Pierre Gassendi\nand Thomas Hobbes, and from the Catholic philosopher-theologian Antoine Arnauld. \n\nAs previously mentioned, Descartes considered the\nMeditations to contain the principles of his physics. But\nthere is no Meditation labeled “principles of physics.” The principles\nin question, which are spread through the work, concern the nature of\nmatter (that its essence is extension), the activity of God in creating\nand conserving the world, the nature of mind (that it is an unextended,\nthinking substance), mind–body union and interaction, and the\nontology of sensory qualities. (Descartes and his followers included topics\nconcerning the nature of the mind and mind–body \ninteraction within physics or\nnatural philosophy, on which, see Hatfield 2000.) \n\nOnce Descartes had presented his metaphysics, he felt free to\nproceed with the publication of his entire physics. However, he needed\nfirst to teach it to speak Latin (3:523), the lingua franca of the\nseventeenth century. He hatched a scheme to publish a Latin version of\nhis physics (the Principles) together with a scholastic\nAristotelian work on physics, so that the comparative advantages would\nbe manifest. For this purpose, he chose the Summa philosophiae\nof Eustace of St. Paul. That part of his plan never came to fruition.\nHis intent remained the same: he wished to produce a book that could be\nadopted in the schools, even Jesuit schools such as \nLa Flêche (3:233, 523). Ultimately, his physics was taught \nin the Netherlands, France, England, and parts of Germany. For the Catholic lands, the\nteaching of his philosophy was dampened when his works were placed on the Index of\nProhibited Books in 1663, although his followers in France, such as\nJacques Rohault (1618–72) and\nPierre Regis (1632–1707),\ncontinued to promote Descartes' natural philosophy. \n\nThe Principles appeared in Latin in 1644, with a French\ntranslation following in 1647. Descartes added to the French\ntranslation an “Author's \nLetter” to serve as a preface. In the letter\nhe explained important elements of his attitude toward philosophy,\nincluding the view that in matters philosophical one must reason\nthrough the arguments and evaluate them for one's self (9B:3). He also\npresented an image of the relations among the various parts of\nphilosophy, in the form of a tree: \nThe extant Principles offer metaphysics in Part I; the general\nprinciples of physics, in the form of his matter theory and laws of\nmotion, are presented in Part II, as following from the metaphysics;\nPart III concerns astronomical phenomena; and Part IV covers the\nformation of the earth and seeks to explain the properties of minerals,\nmetals, magnets, fire, and the like, to which are appended discussions\nof how the senses operate and a final discussion of methodological\nissues in natural philosophy. His intent had been also to explain in depth the\norigins of plants and animals, human physiology, mind–body union\nand interaction, and the function of the senses. In the end, he had to\nabandon the discussion of plants and animals (Princ. IV.188),\nbut he included some discussion of mind–body union in his \nabbreviated account of the senses. \n\nFrom early in his correspondence with Mersenne, Descartes showed a\nconcern to avoid becoming embroiled in theological controversy or\nearning the enmity of church authorities (1:85–6, 150, 271). \nNonetheless, he was drawn into theological controversy with Calvinist\ntheologians in the Netherlands. In the latter 1630s, \nHenry le Roy (1598–1679), or Regius, \na professor of medicine in Utrecht, taught Descartes' system of\nnatural philosophy. Already by 1640, Gisbert Voetius (1589–1676), \na theologian at\nUtrecht, expressed his displeasure over this to Mersenne (3:230).\nControversy brewed, at first between Regius and Voetius, with Descartes\nadvising the former. Voetius, who was rector of the University,\nconvinced the faculty senate to condemn Descartes' philosophy in 1642.\nHe and his colleagues published two works (in 1642 and 1643) attacking\nDescartes' philosophy, to which Descartes himself responded by\npublishing a Letter to Voetius (1643). The controversy\nsimmered through the mid-1640s. Descartes eventually had a falling out\nwith Regius, who published a broadsheet or manifesto that\ndeviated from Descartes' theory of the \nhuman mind. Descartes replied\nwith his Comments on a Certain Broadsheet (1648). \n\nIn the mid-1640s, Descartes continued work on his physiological\nsystem, which he had pursued throughout the 1630s. He allowed his\nTreatise on Man to be copied (4:566–7) and \nhe began a new work (5:112),\nDescription of the Human Body, in which he sought to explain\nthe embryonic development of animal bodies. During this period he\ncorresponded with Princess Elisabeth, at first on topics in metaphysics\nstemming from her reading of the Meditations and then on the\npassions and emotions. Eventually, he wrote the Passions of the\nSoul (1649), which gave the most extensive account of his behavioral\nphysiology to be published in his lifetime and which contained a\ncomprehensive and original theory of the passions and emotions.\nPortions of this work constitute what we have of Descartes' moral\ntheory. \n\nIn 1649, Descartes accepted the invitation of Queen Christina of\nSweden to join her court. At the Queen's request, he composed the\nStatutes of the Swedish Royal Academy. On the day he delivered them to\nher, he became ill. He never recovered. He died on 11 February\n1650. \nIn general, it is rare for a philosopher's positions and arguments to\nremain the same across an entire life. This means that, in reading\nphilosophers' works and reconstructing their arguments, \none must pay\nattention to the place of each work in the philosophical development of\nthe author in question. Readers of the philosophical works of Immanuel\nKant are aware of the basic distinction between his critical and\nprecritical periods. Readers of the works of G. W. Leibniz are also\naware of his philosophical development, although in his case there is\nless agreement on how to place his writings into a developmental\nscheme. \n\nScholars have proposed various schemes for dividing Descartes' life\ninto periods. This entry adopts a relatively simple division between\nthe era when mathematics provided the model for his method and the\nperiod after the “metaphysical turn” of 1629, when his\nconception of the role of the intellect in acquiring knowledge changed\nand when he came to conceive the truth of his special or particular\nhypotheses in natural philosophy as less than certain and so as\nsubject to the scheme of confirmation through consequences mentioned\nabove. In effect, he adopted a hypothetico-deductive scheme of\nconfirmation, but with this difference: the range of hypotheses was\nlimited by his metaphysical conclusions concerning the essence of mind\nand matter, their union, and the role of God in creating and\nconserving the universe. Consequently, some hypotheses, such as the\n“substantial forms” of scholastics, were ruled\nout. Argumentative differences among the World,\nDiscourse, and Meditations and Principles\nmay then be seen as arising from the fact that in the 1630s Descartes\nhad not yet presented his metaphysics and so adopted an empirical mode\nof justification, whereas after 1641 he could appeal to his published\nmetaphysics in seeking to secure the general framework of his\nphysics. \n\nOther scholars see things differently. John Schuster (1980) finds\nthat the epistemology of the Rules lasted into the 1630s and\nwas superseded (unhappily, in his view) only by the metaphysical quest\nfor certainty of the Meditations. Daniel Garber (1992, 48)\nalso holds that Descartes abandoned his early method after the\nDiscourse. Machamer and McGuire (2006) believe that Descartes\nexpected natural philosophy to meet the standard of absolute certainty\nthrough the time of the Meditations, and that he in effect\nadmitted defeat on that score in the final articles of the\nPrinciples, adopting a lower standard of certainty for his\nparticular hypotheses (such as the explanation of magnetism by\ncorkscrew-shaped particles). They see the Principles as\nmarking Descartes' “epistemic \nturn” away from the methodological stance\nof realism found in the Rules, Discourse, and\nMeditations. \n\nThese contrasting views of Descartes' intellectual development suggest\ndifferent relations between his metaphysics and physics.  Schuster\n(1980) treats Descartes' metaphysical arguments as a kind of\nafterthought. Machamer and McGuire (2006) see Descartes' alleged\n“epistemic turn” and his retreat from realism as a\nresponse to philosophical criticism in 1641; they find more continuity\nbetween Descartes' Rules and his writings up to 1641 than does\nGarber, or than is presented herein. One way of understanding this earlier\ndiscontinuity is to grant that Descartes was working on physical problems first, \nwhile emphasizing that his metaphysical insights of 1628–9\nallowed him to achieve a general conception of matter as having only\n“geometrical” properties, viz., size, shape, position, and motion. \n\nThere are also differences among interpreters concerning the\nrelative priority in Descartes' philosophical endeavors of epistemology\nor the theory of knowledge as opposed to metaphysics or first\nphilosophy. In the account of Descartes' development from Sec. 1,\nhe was interested in epistemological and methodological questions\nfirst, and these interests came to a head in the Rules.\nThereafter, his aim was to establish a new natural philosophy based on\na new metaphysics. In the extant works from the 1630s, the\nWorld and Discourse plus essays, he argued for the\ngeneral principles of his physics, including his conception of matter,\non empirical grounds. He argued from explanatory scope and theoretical\nparsimony. As regards parsimony or simplicity, he pointed out that his\nreconceived matter had only a few basic properties (especially size,\nshape, position, and motion), from which he would construct his explanations. He\nclaimed great explanatory scope by contending that his explanations\ncould extend to all natural phenomena, celestial and terrestrial,\ninorganic and organic. But throughout the 1630s, Descartes claimed that\nhe also was in possession of a metaphysics that could justify the first\nprinciples of his physics, which he finally presented in \nthe Meditations and Principles. \n\nSome scholars emphasize the epistemological aspects of Descartes'\nwork, starting with the Rules and continuing through to the\nPrinciples. Accordingly, the main change in Descartes'\nintellectual development is the introduction of skeptical arguments in\nthe Discourse and Meditations. Many interpreters,\nrepresented prominently in the latter twentieth century by Richard\nPopkin (1979), believe that Descartes took the skeptical threat to\nknowledge quite seriously and sought to overcome it in the\nMeditations. By contrast, in the main interpretive thread \nfollowed here, skeptical arguments were a cognitive tool that Descartes\nused in order to guide the reader of the Meditations into the\nright cognitive frame of mind for grasping the first truths of \nmetaphysics. Achieving stable knowledge of such truths would have as\na side-effect security against skeptical challenge. \n\nThe reader who is curious about these issues should read the\nrelevant works of Descartes, together with his correspondence from the\nlatter half of the 1630s and early 1640s. \nDescartes first presented his metaphysics in the Meditations\nand then reformulated it in textbook-format in the Principles.\nHis metaphysics sought to answer these philosophical questions: How\ndoes the human mind acquire knowledge? What is the mark of truth? What\nis the actual nature of reality? How are our experiences related to our\nbodies and brains? Is there a benevolent God, and if so, how can we\nreconcile his existence with the facts of illness, error, and immoral\nactions? Descartes had no doubt that human beings know some things and are\ncapable of discovering others, including (at least since his\nmetaphysical insights of 1629) fundamental truths about the basic\nstructure of reality. Yet he also believed that the philosophical\nmethods taught in the schools of his time and used by most of his\ncontemporaries were deeply flawed. He believed that the doctrines of\nscholastic Aristotelian philosophy contained a basic error about the\nmanner in which fundamental truths, such as the truths of metaphysics,\nare to be gained. He expressed this mistaken view in the First\nMeditation, by saying (not in his own voice, but in a voice for the\nreader): “Whatever I have up till now accepted as most true I\nhave acquired either from the senses or through the senses”\n(7:18). He then went on to challenge the veridicality of the senses\nwith the skeptical arguments of First Meditation, including arguments\nfrom previous errors, the dream argument, and the argument from a\ndeceptive God or an evil deceiver. \n\nIn the Aristotelian scheme against which Descartes is moving, all\nknowledge arises from the senses, in accordance with the slogan “There\nis nothing in the intellect that was not previously in the senses”\n(7:75, 267). Similarly, orthodox scholastic Aristotelians agreed that\nthere is “no thought without a phantasm,” or an image. Descartes\nexplained these convictions as the results of childhood prejudice (7:2,\n17, 69, 107; Princ. I.71–3). As children, we are\nnaturally led by our senses in seeking benefits and avoiding bodily\nharms. As a result, when we grow into adults we are “immersed” in the\nbody and the senses, and so we accept the philosophical view that the\nsenses are the basis for learning about the nature of the reality\n(7:38, 75, 82–3). \n\nDescartes denied that the senses reveal the natures of substances.  He\nheld that in fact the human intellect is able to perceive the nature\nof reality through a purely intellectual perception. This means that,\nin order to procure the fundamental truths of metaphysics, we must\n“withdraw the mind from the senses” (7:4, 12, 14) and turn\ntoward our innate ideas of the essences of things, including the\nessences of mind, matter, and an infinite being (God). Descartes\nconstructed the Meditations so as to secure this process of\nwithdrawal from the senses in Meditation I. Meditation II brings the\ndiscovery of an initial truth, in the cogito (7:25), which is\nelsewhere summarized as the argument “cogito, ergo sum,”\nor “I think, therefore I am” (7:140). Descartes observes\nthat the cogito result is known only from the fact that it is\n“clearly and distinctly” perceived by the intellect\n(7:35). Hence, he sets up clear and distinct intellectual perception,\nindependent of the senses, as the mark of truth (7:35, 62, 73). \n\nDescartes then unfolds the results of clear and distinct perception\nin Meditations III–VI, and he repeats and extends these results\nin Principles I–II. We consider these results in Secs.\n3.3–3.5. For now, let us examine what Descartes thought about the\nsenses as a source of knowledge that was different from the pure\nintellect. \n\nDescartes famously calls the senses into doubt in the First\nMeditation, and he affirms in Meditation Six that the senses are not\nmeant to provide knowledge of the “essential nature” of external\nobjects (7:83). In that way, his position in the Meditations\ndiffers from that in the Rules, for in that work he allowed\nthat some “simple natures” pertaining to corporeal things can and\nshould be considered through the images of the senses (10:383, 417). In\nthe Meditations, he held that the essence of matter could be\napprehended by innate ideas, independently of any sensory image\n(7:64–5, 72–3). To that extent, his later position agrees\nwith the Platonic tradition in philosophy, which denigrated sensory\nknowledge and held that the things known by the intellect have a higher\nreality than the objects of the senses. Descartes, however, was no\nPlatonist, a point to which we will return. His attitude toward the\nsenses in his mature period was not one of total disparagement. \n\nDescartes assigned two roles to the senses in the acquisition of\nhuman knowledge. First, he acknowledged that the senses are usually\nadequate for detecting benefits and harms for the body. Indeed, he\nconsidered their natural function to be “to inform the mind of what is\nbeneficial or harmful for the composite of which the mind is a part”\n(7:83), that is, for the composite of mind and body. In this\nconnection, he was agreeing with the conception of the function of the\nsenses that was widely shared in the traditional literature in natural\nphilosophy, including the Aristotelian literature, as well as in the\nmedical literature on the natural functions of the senses. \n\nSecond, he recognized that the senses have an essential role to play\nin natural philosophy. The older interpretive literature sometimes had\nDescartes claiming that he could derive all natural philosophical or\nscientific knowledge from the pure intellect, independent of the\nsenses. But Descartes knew full well that he could not do that. He\ndistinguished between the general principles of his physics and the\nmore particular mechanisms that he posited to explain natural\nphenomena, such as magnetism or the properties of oil and water. He\nclaimed to derive the general principles “from certain seeds of truth”\nthat are innate in the mind (6:64). These include the fundamental\ndoctrine that the essence of matter is extension (Princ.\nII.3–4, IV.203). As to particular phenomena, in general he had to\nrely on observations to determine their properties (such as the\nproperties of the magnet), and he acknowledged that multiple hypotheses\nabout subvisible mechanisms could be constructed to account for those\nphenomena. The natural philosopher must, therefore, test the various\nhypotheses by their consequences, and consider empirical virtues such\nas simplicity and scope (Disc. VI; Princ.\nIV.201–6). Further, Descartes knew that some problems rely on\nmeasurements that can only be made with the senses, including\ndetermining the size of the sun (7:80) or the refractive indexes of\nvarious materials (Met. VIII). \n\nAlthough Descartes recognized an important role for the senses in \nnatural philosophy, he also limited the role of sense-based knowledge\nby comparison with Aristotelian epistemology. According to many\nscholastic Aristotelians, all intellectual content arises through a \nprocess of intellectual abstraction that starts from sensory images as\npresent in the faculty of imagination. Mathematical\nobjects are formed by abstraction from such images. Even metaphysics\nrests on knowledge derived by abstraction from images. Of course,\nin this Aristotelian scheme the intellect plays an important role \nin grasping mathematical objects\nor the essences of natural things through considering images. By \ncontrast, Descartes affirmed that the truths of mathematics and\nmetaphysics are grasped by the intellect operating independently\nof the senses and without need for assistance from the faculty\nof imagination. Descartes designated the exercise of the intellectual \ncapacity apart from sense-based images the use of the \n“pure intellect.” \n\nIn Descartes' scheme of mental capacities, knowledge does\nnot arise from the intellect alone. The intellect may present\nsome content as true, but by itself it does not affirm or deny\nthat truth. That function belongs to the will. A judgment, and hence\nan instance of (at least putative) knowledge, does not arise in\nthis scheme until the will has affirmed or denied the content\npresented by the intellect. \n\nMoreover, not all content deriving from the intellectual faculty \nis “pure.” In\nDescartes' scheme, there are only two powers of mind: the\nintellect and the will (Med. IV, \nPrinc. I.32–4). The \nintellect is the power of perception\nor representation. Acts of pure intellect occur without\nthe need for any accompanying brain processes; these are purely\nintellectual perceptions. But there are\nother intellectual acts that require the presence of the body:\nsense perception, imagination, and corporeal (body-involving) \nmemory. These intellectual acts are less clear and distinct\nthan acts of pure intellect, and may indeed be obscure and\nconfused (as in the case of color sensations). Nonetheless,\nthe will may affirm or deny such content. As discussed in\nthe next subsection, error can arise in these judgments. \n\nIn sum, in considering Descartes' answer to how we know, \nwe can distinguish classes of knowledge that differ as regards\nthe degree of certainty one may expect to achieve. Metaphysical \nfirst principles as known by the\nintellect acting alone should attain absolute\ncertainty. Practical knowledge concerning immediate benefits and harms\nis known by the senses. Such knowledge is usually good enough. Objects\nof natural science are known by a combination of pure intellect and\nsensory observation: the pure intellect tells us what properties bodies\ncan have, and we use the senses to determine which particular instances of\nthose properties bodies do\nhave. For submicroscopic particles, we must reason from observed\neffects to potential cause. In these latter cases, our measurements and\nour inferences may be subject to error, but we may also hope to arrive\nat the truth. \nAt the beginning of the Third Meditation, \nDescartes declares “I now\nseem to be able to lay it down as a general rule that whatever I\nperceive very clearly and distinctly is true” (7:35). Clarity and\ndistinctness of intellectual perception is the mark of truth. \nIn the fifth set of Objections to the Meditations, Gassendi\nsuggests that there is difficulty concerning \nGassendi has in effect asked how it is that we should recognize clear\nand distinct perceptions. If clarity and distinctness is the mark of\ntruth, what is the method for recognizing clarity and distinctness? \n\nIn reply, Descartes claims that he has already supplied such a\nmethod (7:379). What could he have in mind? It cannot be the simple belief \nthat one has attained clarity and distinctness, for Descartes himself\nacknowledges that individuals can be wrong in that belief (7:35, 361).\nNonetheless, he does offer a criterion. We have a clear and distinct\nperception of something if, when we consider it, we cannot doubt it\n(7:145). That is, in the face of genuine clear and distinct perception,\nour affirmation of it is so firm that it cannot be shaken,\neven by a concerted effort to call the things thus affirmed\ninto doubt. \n\nAs mentioned in 3.1, Descartes held that any act of judgment, such as\nthe affirmation “I think, therefore I am,” involves both\nthe intellect and will. The intellect perceives or represents the\ncontent of the judgment; the will affirms or denies that content. In\nthe face of genuine clarity and distinctness, “a great light in\nthe intellect” is followed by “a great inclination of the\nwill” (7:59). The inclination of the will is so strong that it\namounts to compulsion; we cannot help but so affirm.  Descartes thus\nmakes unshakable conviction the criterion. Can't someone be unshakable\nin their conviction merely because they are stubborn? Assuredly\nso. But Descartes is talking about a conviction that remains\nunshakable in face of serious and well-thought out challenges\n(7:22). To be immune from doubt does not mean simply that you do not\ndoubt a proposition, or even that it resists a momentary attempt to\ndoubt; the real criterion for truth is that the content of a\nproposition is so clearly perceived that the will is drawn to it in\nsuch a way that the will's affirmation cannot be shaken even by the\nsystematic and sustained doubts of the Meditations. Perhaps\nbecause the process for achieving knowledge of fundamental truths\nrequires sustained, systematic doubt, Descartes indicates that such\ndoubt should be undertaken only once in the course of a life (7:18;\n3:695). \n\nEven so, problems remain. Having extracted clarity and distinctness \nas the criterion of truth\nat the beginning of the Third Meditation, Descartes immediately calls\nit into question. He re-introduces an element of the radical doubt from\nthe First Meditation: that a powerful God might have created him with\n“a nature such that I was deceived even in matters which seemed most\nevident” (7:36). Descartes therefore launches an investigation of\n“whether there is a God, and, if there is, whether he can be a\ndeceiver” (7:36). \n\nIn the course of the Third Meditation, Descartes constructs an\nargument for the existence of God that starts from the fact that he has\nan idea of an infinite being. The argument is intricate. It invokes the\nmetaphysical principle that “there must be at least \nas much reality in the efficient and total cause as in the effect \nof that cause” (7:40). This principle is \nput forward as something that is “manifest by the\nnatural light” (7:40), which \nitself is described as a cognitive power\nwhose results are indubitable (7:38), like clear and distinct\nperception (7:144). Descartes then applies that principle not to the\nmere existence of the idea of God as a state of mind, but to the\ncontent of that idea. Descartes characterizes that content as infinite,\nand he then argues that a content that represents infinity requires an\ninfinite being as its cause. He concludes, therefore, that an infinite\nbeing, or God, must exist. He then equates an infinite being with a\nperfect being and asks whether a perfect being could be a deceiver. He\nconcludes: “It is clear enough from this that \nhe cannot be a deceiver,\nsince it is manifest by the natural light that all fraud and deception\ndepend on some defect” (7:52). \n\nThe second and fourth sets of objections drew attention to a\nproblematic characteristic of this argument. In the words of\nArnauld: \nArnauld here raises the well-known problem of the Cartesian circle,\nwhich has been much discussed by commentators in recent years. \n\nIn reply to Arnauld, Descartes claims that he avoided this problem\nby distinguishing between present clear and distinct perceptions and\nthose that are merely remembered (7:246). He is not here challenging\nthe reliability of memory (Frankfurt 1962). Rather, his\nstrategy is to suggest that the hypothesis of a deceiving God can only\npresent itself when we are not clearly and distinctly perceiving the\ninfinity and perfection of God, because when we are doing that we\ncannot help but believe that God is no deceiver. It is as if this very\nevident perception is then to be balanced with the uncertain opinion\nthat God might be a deceiver (7:144). The evident perception wins out\nand the doubt is removed. \n\nDescartes explicitly responds to the charge of circularity in the\nmanner just described. Over the years, scholars have debated whether\nthis response is adequate. Some scholars have constructed other\nresponses on Descartes' behalf or have found such responses embedded\nin his text at various locations. One type of response appeals to a\ndistinction between the natural light and clear and distinct\nperception, and seeks to vindicate the natural light without appeal to\nGod (Jacquette 1996). Another response suggests that, in the end,\nDescartes was not aiming at metaphysical certainty concerning a\nmind-independent world but was merely seeking an internally coherent\nset of beliefs (Frankfurt 1965). A related response suggests that\nDescartes was after mere psychological certainty (Loeb 1992). The\ninterested reader can follow up this question by turning to the\nliterature here cited (as also Carriero 2008, Doney 1987, and\nHatfield 2006). \n\nBuilding on his claim that clear and distinct perceptions are true,\nDescartes seeks to establish various results concerning the nature of\nreality, including the existence of a perfect God as well as the\nnatures of mind and matter (to which we turn in the next subsection).\nHere we must ask: What is the human mind that it can perceive the\nnature of reality? Descartes has a specific answer to this question:\nthe human mind comes supplied with innate ideas that allow it to\nperceive the main properties of God (infinity and perfection), the\nessence of matter, and the essence of mind. For readers \nin Descartes'\nday, this claim would naturally raise a further question: assuming\nthat these innate ideas concern “eternal \ntruths” about God, matter, and mind, \ndo these truths hold independently of God, or do they instead \nreflect the contents of God's own intellect? \n\nDescartes rejected both alternatives. He denied,\nalong with many of his contemporaries, that there are eternal\ntruths independent of the existence of God. But he also denied\nthat the eternal truths are fixed in God's intellect. Some\nNeoplatonist philosophers held that the eternal truths in the human\nmind are copies, or ectypes, of the archetypes in the mind of God. Some\nAristotelian philosophers just prior to Descartes, including Francisco\nSuárez (1548–1617), held that \nthe eternal truths reflect God's own understanding of\nhis creative power; God's power includes that, \nif he creates a rabbit, it must be an animal. Eternal truths are \nlatent in God's creative\npower, and he understands this, so that if human beings understand the\neternal truths as eternal, they also do so by understanding the creative\npower of God (Hatfield 1993). \n\nDescartes had a different account. He held that the eternal truths are the\nfree creations of God (1:145, 149, 151; 7:380, 432), originating from him\nin a way that does not distinguish among his power, will, and intellect. God \ndecides what\nthe essence of a circle is, or to make 2 + 3 = 5. He might have created\nother essences, although we are unable to conceive what they\nmight have been. Our conceptual capacity is limited to the innate ideas\nthat God has implanted in us, and these reflect the actual truths that\nhe created. God creates the eternal truths (concerning logic,\nmathematics, the nature of the good, the essences of mind and matter),\nand he creates the human mind and provisions it with innate ideas that\ncorrespond to those truths. However, even in this scheme there must\nremain some eternal truths that are not created by God: those that \npertain to the essence of God himself, including his existence\nand perfection (see Wells 1982). \nDescartes reveals his ontology implicitly in the Meditations,\nmore formally in the Replies, and in textbook fashion in the\nPrinciples. The main metaphysical results that describe the\nnature of reality assert the existence of three substances, each\ncharacterized by an essence. The first and primary substance is God,\nwhose essence is perfection. In fact, God is the only true substance,\nthat is, the only being that is capable of existing on its own. The\nother two substances, mind and matter, are created by God and can only\nexist through his ongoing act of preservation or conservation, called\nGod's “concurrence” (Princ. I.51). \n\nDescartes' arguments to establish the essences of these substances\nappeal directly to his clear and distinct perception of those\nessences.  The essence of matter is extension in length, breadth, and\ndepth. One might speak here of “spatial extension,” but\nwith this proviso: that Descartes denied the existence of space\nseparate from matter. Cartesian matter does not fill a distinct\nspatial container; rather, spatial extension is constituted by\nextended matter (there is no void, or unfilled space). This extended\nsubstance possesses the further “modes” of size, shape,\nposition, and motion. Modes are properties that exist only as\nmodifications of the essential (principal) and the general attributes\nof a substance. In addition to its essence, extension, matter also has\nthe general attributes of existence and duration. The individual parts\nof matter have durations as particular modes. All the modes of\nmatter, including size, shape, position, and motion, can exist only as\nmodifications of extended substance. \n\nThe essence of mind is thought. Besides existence and duration, minds have \nthe two chief powers or faculties previously mentioned: intellect and will. The\nintellectual (or perceiving) power is further divided into the modes of\npure intellect, imagination, and sense perception. Pure intellect\noperates independently of the brain or body; imagination and sense\nperception depend upon the body for their operation (as does corporeal\nmemory). The will is also\ndivided into various modes, including desire, aversion, assertion,\ndenial, and doubt. These always require some intellectual content\n(whether pure, imagined, or sensory) upon which to operate. Perhaps for\nthat reason, Descartes describes the mind as an “intellectual\nsubstance” (7:78; also, 7:12). It seems he held that \nthe mind essentially has a will, but that the intellectual (or perceptive, or\nrepresentational) power is more basic, because the will depends on it\nin its operation. \n\nWhat role does consciousness play in Descartes' theory of mind? Many\nscholars believe that, for Descartes, consciousness is the defining\nproperty of mind (e.g., Rozemond 2006). There is some support for this\nposition in the Second Replies. There Descartes defines mind as\n“the substance in which thought immediately resides”\n(7:161). He says of the term “thought” that it extends to\n“everything that is within us in such a way that we are\nimmediately conscious of it” (7:160*). If mind is thinking\nsubstance and thoughts are essentially conscious, perhaps\nconsciousness is the essence of thought? \n\nDescartes in fact did hold that all thoughts are, in some way,\nconscious (7:226). He did not mean by this that we have reflective\nawareness of, and can remember, every thought that we have (5:220). In\nthe Second Meditation, he describes himself as a thinking thing by\nenumerating all the modes of thoughts of which he is conscious:\nunderstanding (or intellection), willing, imagining, and (at this\npoint, at least seeming to have) sense perceptions (7:28). He thus sets\nup consciousness as a mark of thought. But is it the essence? There is\nanother possibility. If perception (intellection, representation) is\nthe essence of thought, then all thoughts might be conscious in a basic\nway because the character of the intellectual substance is to\nrepresent, and any representation present in an intellectual substance\nis thereby conscious. Similarly, any act of will present in an\nintellectual substance also is available to consciousness, because it\nis of the essence of such a substance to perceive its own states\n(11:343). Accordingly, perception or representation is the essence of mind,\nand consciousness follows as a result of the mind's being\na representing substance. \n\nAll the same, in distinguishing between thoughts possessed of consciousness\nand thoughts of which we are reflectively aware, Descartes opened a space\nfor conscious thoughts that we don't notice or remember. As in his\ntheory of the senses (Sec. 5), he allows for unnoticed sensations and unnoticed\nmental operations upon them. \nIn the Discourse, Descartes presented the following argument\nto establish that mind and body are distinct substances:  \n\nThis argument moves from the fact that he can doubt the existence of\nthe material world, but cannot doubt the existence of himself as a\nthinking thing, to the conclusion that his thoughts belong to a\nnonspatial substance that is distinct from matter. \n\nThe argument is fallacious. It relies\non conceivability based in ignorance. Descartes has not\nincluded anything in the argument to ward off the possibility that he,\nas a thinking thing, is in fact a complex material system. He has\nmerely relied on the fact that he can doubt the existence of matter to\nconclude that matter is distinct from mind. This argument is\nclearly inconclusive. From the fact that the Joker cannot, at a certain\nmoment, doubt the existence of Batman (because he is with him), but he\ncan doubt the existence of Bruce Wayne (who might, for all the Joker\nknows, have been killed by the Joker's henchmen), it does not follow\nthat Bruce Wayne is not Batman. In fact, he is Batman. The Joker is\nmerely ignorant of that fact. \n\nIn the Meditations, Descartes changed the structure of the\nargument. In the Second Meditation, he established that he could not\ndoubt the existence of himself as a thinking thing, but that he could\ndoubt the existence of matter. However, he explicitly refused to use\nthis situation to conclude that his mind was distinct from body, on the\ngrounds that he was still ignorant of his nature (7:27). Then, in the\nSixth Meditation, having established, to his satisfaction, the mark of\ntruth, he used that mark to frame a positive argument to the effect that\nthe essence of mind is thought and that a thinking thing is\nunextended; and that the essence of matter is extension and that\nextended things cannot think (7:78). He based this argument on clear\nand distinct intellectual perceptions of the essences of mind and\nmatter, not on the fact that he could doubt the existence of one or the\nother. \n\nThis conclusion in the Sixth Meditation asserts the well-known\nsubstance dualism of Descartes. That dualism leads to problems. As\nPrincess Elisabeth, among others, asked: if mind is\nunextended and matter is extended, how do they interact? This problem\nvexed not only Descartes, who admitted to Elisabeth that he \ndidn't have a good answer (3:694), but it \nalso vexed Descartes' followers and other\nmetaphysicians. It seems that, somehow, states of the mind and the body \nmust be brought into relation, because when we decide to pick up a pencil\nour arm actually moves, and when light hits our eyes we experience the\nvisible world. But how do mind and body interact? Some of \nDescartes'\nfollowers adopted an occasionalist position, according to which God\nmediates the causal relations between mind and body; mind does not\naffect body, and body does not affect mind, but God gives the mind\nappropriate sensations at the right moment, and he makes the body move\nby putting it into the correct brain states at a moment that\ncorresponds to the volition to pick up the pencil. Other philosophers\nadopted yet other solutions, including the monism of Spinoza and the\npre-established harmony of Leibniz. \n\nIn the Meditations and Principles, Descartes did not\nfocus on the metaphysical question of how mind and body interact.\nRather, he discussed the functional role of mind–body union in\nthe economy of life. As it happens, our sensations serve us well in\navoiding harms and pursuing benefits. Pain-sensations warn us of\nbodily damage. Pleasure leads us to approach things that (usually) are\ngood for us. Our sense perceptions are reliable enough that we can\ndistinguish objects that need distinguishing, and we can navigate as\nwe move about. As Descartes saw it, “God \nor nature” set up these relations for our \nbenefit. They are not perfect. Sometimes our senses present things \ndifferently than they are, and sometimes we make judgments about sensory \nthings that extend beyond the appropriate use of the senses. \nIn discussing the mark of truth, Descartes suggested that the human\nintellect is generally reliable because it was created by God. In\ndiscussing the functioning of the senses to preserve or maintain the\nbody, he explained that God has arranged the rules of mind–body\ninteraction in such a manner as to produce sensations that generally are\nconducive to the good of the body.\nNonetheless, in each case, errors occur. In various circumstances, our\njudgments may be false (often, about sensory things), just as, more broadly, human\nbeings make poor moral choices, even though God has given them a will\nthat is intrinsically drawn to the good (1:366, 5:159, Princ.\nI.42). In addition, our sense perceptions may represent things\nas being a certain way, when they are not. Sometimes we\nfeel pain because a nerve has been damaged somewhere along its length,\nand yet there is no tissue damage at the place in which the pain is felt. \nAmputees may feel pain in their fingers when they have no fingers\n(Princ. IV.196). \n\nDescartes responded to these problems differently. He explained\ncognitive and moral errors as resulting from human freedom. God\nprovides human beings with a will, and wills are intrinsically free. In\nthis way, there is no difference in degree in freedom between God and\nman. But human beings have finite intellects. And because they are\nfree, they can choose to judge in cognitive or moral situations for\nwhich they do not have clear and distinct perceptions of the true or\nthe good. If human beings restricted their acts of will to cases of\nclear and distinct perception, they would never err. But the\nvicissitudes of life may require judgments in less than optimal\ncircumstances, or we may decide to judge even though we lack a clear\nperception. In either case, we may go wrong. \n\nMatters are different for the errors of sensory representation. The senses\ndepend on media and sense organs and on nerves that must run from the\nexterior of the body into the brain. God sets up the mind–body\nrelation so that our sensations are good guides for most circumstances.\nBut the media may be poor (the light may not be good), circumstances\nmay be unusual (as with the partially submerged stick that appears as\nif bent), or the nerves may be damaged (as with the amputee). In these\ncases, the reports of the senses are suboptimal. Since God has\nset up the system of mind–body union, \nshouldn't God \nbe held accountable for the fact that the senses can misrepresent\nhow things are? Here Descartes does not appeal to our freedom not \nto attend to the senses, for\nin fact we must often use the senses in suboptimal cognitive\ncircumstances when navigating through life. Rather, he points out that God\nwas working with the finite mechanisms of the human body (7:88), and\nhe suggests that God did the best that could be done given the type of parts\nneeded to constitute such a machine (extended parts that might\nbreak or be perturbated in an unusual manner). \n\nIn fact, the distinction between these two types of error, cognitive error\nand sensory misrepresentation, is not completely clear-cut in Descartes. \nIn the case of the amputee, the pain seems to\nbe in fingers that are not there. That appears to be a clear case of\nsensory misrepresentation: the representational content (that the fingers\nare damaged) does not match the world. Similarly with the partially\nsubmerged stick. It may look bent. In these cases, even if we use our \nintellects to interpret the illusions or sensory misrepresentations so\nas to avoid error by withholding judgment or even by judging correctly (7:438), \nthere is a clear sense in which sensory misrepresentation has occurred. \n\nIn other cases, however, Descartes describes the senses as providing\nmaterial for error, but it remains uncertain whether he assimilates \nsuch error to what has been labelled cognitive error or to sensory \nmisrepresentation. In the Third Meditation, he describes color\nsensations and other sensations of so-called “secondary \nqualities” as “materially \nfalse.” Scholars have found it difficult to \ninterpret the notion of material falsity, partly because \nDescartes' discussion of it in the\nThird Meditation seems to offer \ntwo possibilities, and partly because his long discussion of the issue \nin the Fourth Replies, in response to Arnauld's \nObjections, is intricate and seemingly contradictory.  In Third Meditation, Descartes initially defines material falsity\nas something that “occurs in ideas, when they represent\nnon-things as things” (7:43). He offers as an example the idea\nof cold: our senses represent cold as a positive quality of objects,\nbut Descartes considers the possibility that cold itself is merely the\nabsence of heat, and so isn't a quality of its own. Accordingly, this\ncase should be assimilated to sensory misrepresentation: representing\nthings as they are not (representing cold as a quality when it is the\nabsence of a quality). Material falsity would be a matter of\nmisrepresentation. \n\nBut Descartes also offers a different gloss on the obscurity of\nsensory ideas. He allows that such ideas may be “true” in\nthe sense of representing something positive in things, but that they\nmay do so in such a way that “the reality which they represent\nis so extremely slight that I cannot even distinguish it from a\nnon-thing” (7:44).  Accordingly, sensory ideas are not\nmisrepresentations, they are simply so obscure and confused that we\ncannot tell what their representational content might be by\nconsidering their experienced character, such as the phenomenal\ncharacter of cold or of color. (Metaphysics and natural philosophy are\nneeded to tell us what our color sensations obscurely represent:\nproperties of object-surfaces that reflect light a certain\nway—see Sec. 5.) In this case, “material falsity”\nwould not amount to misrepresentation but to representation so obscure\nthat it leaves room for mistaken judgments, such as the so-called\n“resemblance thesis,” that qualities in objects resemble\nour sensations of them. On this interpretation, Descartes is saying\nthat the resemblance thesis arises not because the sensory ideas of\ncold or of color misrepresent those qualities in objects, but because\nwe make a cognitive error, stemming from the prejudices of childhood\n(as mentioned in Sec. 3.1 and discussed more fully in Princ.\nI.66–72), in affirming the resemblance thesis. \nThe issues surrounding the notion of material falsity in Descartes\nare intricate and cut to the core of his theory of mind and of \nsensory representation. The interested reader can gain entrance\nto literature through Wee (2006) and Hatfield (2013). \nWhen Descartes was at La Flèche, there already were signs that the\nconception of the universe was changing. Recall that Galileo's\ndiscovery of four moons of the planet Jupiter was celebrated at La\nFlèche in 1610. More generally, Copernicus had, in the previous\ncentury, offered a forceful argument for believing that the sun, not\nthe earth, is at the center of the solar system. Early in the\nseventeenth century, Johannes Kepler announced new results in optics,\nconcerning the formation of images, the theory of lenses, and the fact\nthat the retinal image plays a central role in vision. By the early\n1630s, Descartes was aware (1:263) of \nWilliam Harvey's claim that the\nblood circulates in the body. \n\nDescartes himself contributed some specific new results to the\nmathematical description of nature, as co-discoverer of the sine law of\nrefraction and as developer of an accurate model of the rainbow.\nNonetheless, as significant as these results are, his primary\ncontribution to the “new science” lay in the way in which he described\na general vision of a mechanistic approach to nature and sketched in\nthe details of that vision to provide a comprehensive alternative to\nthe dominant Aristotelian physics. \n\nIn the textbooks of Aristotelian physics of Descartes' day, it was\ncommon to divide physics \ninto “general” and\n“special.” General physics \npertained to the basic\nAristotelian principles for analyzing natural substances: form,\nmatter, privation, cause, place, time, motion.  Special physics\nconcerned actually existing natural entities, divided into inanimate\nand animate. Inanimate physics further divided into celestial and\nterrestrial, in accordance with the Aristotelian belief that the earth\nwas at the center of the universe, and that the earth was of a\ndifferent nature than the heavens (including the moon, and everything\nbeyond it). Inanimate terrestrial physics first covered the four\nelements (earth, air, fire, and water), then the “mixed”\nbodies composed from them, including the various mineral\nkinds. Animate terrestrial physics concerned the various powers that\nAristotelians ascribed to ensouled beings, where the soul is\nconsidered as a principle of life (possessing vital as well as mental or\ncognitive powers). In the simplest textbooks, the powers of the soul\nwere divided into three groups: vegetative (including nutrition,\ngrowth, and reproduction), which pertained to both plants and animals;\nsensitive (including external senses, internal senses, appetite, and\nmotion), which pertain to animals alone; and rational powers,\npertaining to human beings alone.  All the bodies in both inanimate\nand animate terrestrial physics were governed by a “form”\nor active principle, as described in Section 1.3. \n\nDescartes' ambition was to provide replacements for all the main\nparts of Aristotelian physics. In his physics, there is only one matter\nand it has no active forms. Thus, he dissolved the boundary that had\nmade the celestial and the terrestrial differ in kind. His one matter\nhad only the properties of size, shape, position, and motion. The\nmatter is infinitely divisible and it constitutes space; there is no\nvoid, hence no spatial container distinct from matter. The motions of\nmatter are governed by three laws of motion, including a precursor to\nNewton's law of inertia (but without the notion of vector forces) and\na law of impact. Descartes' matter possessed \nno “force” or active\nagency; the laws of motion were decreed by God and were sustained by\nhis activity. Earth, air, fire, and water were simply four among many\nnatural kinds, all distinguished simply by the characteristic sizes,\nshapes, positions, and motions of their parts. \n\nAlthough Descartes nominally subscribed to the biblical story of\ncreation, in his natural philosophy he presented the hypothesis that\nthe universe began as a chaotic soup of particles in motion and that\neverything else was subsequently formed as a result of patterns that\ndeveloped within this moving matter. Thus, he conceived that many suns\nformed, around which planets coalesced. On these planets, mountains\nand seas formed, as did metals, magnets, and atmospheric phenomena\nsuch as clouds and rain. The planets themselves are carried around the\nsun in their orbits by a fluid medium that rotates like a whirlpool or\nvortex.  Objects fall to earth not because of any intrinsic\n“form” that directs them to the center of the universe,\nand also not because of a force of attraction or other\ndownward-tending force. Rather, they are driven down by the whirling\nparticles of the surrounding ether. Descartes insisted that all cases\nof apparent action at a distance, including magnetism, must be\nexplained through the contact of particle on particle. He explained\nmagnetism as the result of corkscrew-shaped particles that spew forth\nfrom the poles of the earth and flow from north to south or vice\nversa, causing magnetized needles to align with their flow\n(Princ. IV.133–83). To explain magnetic polarity,\nDescartes posited that the particles exiting from the south pole are\nthreaded in one direction and those from the north are threaded\noppositely (like the oppositely threaded spindles on bicycle\npedals). \n\nDescartes also wanted to provide an account of the formation of\nplants and animals by mechanical causes, but he did not succeed during\nhis lifetime in framing an account that he was willing to publish (so that\nonly portions of his physiology were revealed in the Discourse,\nDioptrics, Meditations, Principles, and \nPassions). In writings that were published only posthumously\n(but were read by friends and followers during his lifetime, e.g.,\n5:112), he developed an extensive physiological description of animal\nbodies, in which he explained the functions of life in a purely\nmechanical manner, without appeal to a soul or vital principle. \n\nIn mechanizing the concept of living thing, Descartes did not deny\nthe distinction between living and nonliving, but he did redraw the line\nbetween ensouled and unensouled beings. In his view, among earthly\nbeings only humans have souls. He thus equated soul with mind: souls\naccount for intellection and volition, including conscious sensory\nexperiences, conscious experience of images, and consciously\nexperienced memories. Descartes regarded nonhuman animals as machines,\ndevoid of mind and consciousness, and hence lacking in sentience. \n(Although Descartes' followers understood him to have denied\nall feeling to animals, some recent scholars question this\ninterpretation; on this controversy, see Cottingham 1998 and Hatfield\n2008.) Consequently, Descartes was required to\nexplain all of the powers that Aristotelians had ascribed to the\nvegetative and sensitive soul by means of purely material and\nmechanistic processes (11:202). These mechanistic explanations\nextended, then, not merely to nutrition, growth, and reproduction, \nbut also to the functions of the external and internal senses,\nincluding the ability of nonhuman animals to respond via their sense\norgans in a situationally appropriate manner: to approach things that\nare beneficial to their body (including food) and to avoid danger (as\nthe sheep avoids the wolf). \n\nIn the Treatise on Man and Passions, Descartes\ndescribed purely mechanical processes in the sense organs, brain, and\nmuscles, that were to account for the functions of the sensitive soul.\nThese processes involved “animal spirits,” or subtle matter, as\ndistilled out of the blood at the base of the brain and distributed\ndown the nerves to cause muscle motions in accordance with brain\nstructures and current sensory stimulation. The brain structures that\nmediate behavior may be innate or acquired. Descartes ascribed some\nthings that animals do to instinct; other aspects of their behavior\nhe explained through a kind of mechanistic associative memory. He held\nthat human physiology is similar to nonhuman animal physiology, as\nregards both vegetative and (some) sensitive functions—those\nsensitive functions that do not involve consciousness or\nintelligence: \n\nMany of the behaviors of human beings are actually carried out without\nintervention from the mind. \n\nThe fact that Descartes offered mechanistic explanations for many\nfeatures of nature does not mean that his explanations were successful.\nIndeed, his followers and detractors debated the success of his various\nproposals for nearly a century after his death. His accounts of\nmagnetism and gravity were challenged. Leibniz challenged the coherence\nof Descartes' laws of motion and impact. Newton offered his own laws of motion\nand an inverse square law of gravitational attraction. His account of\norbital planetary motions replaced Descartes' vortexes. Others\nstruggled to make Descartes' physiology work. There were also deeper\nchallenges. Some wondered whether Descartes could actually explain how\nhis infinitely divisible matter could coalesce into solid bodies. Why\nshouldn't collections of particles act like whiffs of smoke, that\nseparate upon contact with large particles? Indeed, how do particles\nthemselves cohere? \n\nSuch problems were real, and Descartes' physics was abandoned over\nthe course of the eighteenth century. Nonetheless, it provided a\nconception for a comprehensive replacement of Aristotelian physics that\npersisted in the Newtonian vision of a unified physics of the celestial\nand terrestrial realms, and that continued in the mechanistic vision of\nlife that was revived in the latter part of the nineteenth century. \nAs the new “mechanical philosophy” of Descartes and others replaced the\nAristotelian physics, the theory of sensory qualities had to undergo\nsubstantial change. This was especially true for what came to be known\nas the secondary qualities (in the terminology of Robert Boyle and John\nLocke). The secondary qualities include colors, sounds, odors, tastes,\nand tactile qualities such as hot and cold. The Aristotelians\nmaintained that these qualities exist in objects as “real qualities”\nthat are like instances or samples of the quality as experienced. A red\nthing possesses the quality red in just the same way it possesses a\nshape: it simply is red, and we experience that very redness when we\nsee a red object (the “resemblance \nthesis” as mentioned in Sec. 3.5). \n\nDescartes sought to replace “real qualities” with a\nmechanistic account of qualities in objects. He rendered light as a\nproperty of particles and their motions: it is a “tendency to\nmove” as found in a continuous medium and radiating out from a\nluminous body. When light strikes an object, the particles that\nconstitute light alter their rotation about their\naxis. “Spin” is what makes light have one color rather\nthan another. When particles with one or another degree of spin\ninteract with the nerves of the retina, they cause those nerves to\njiggle in a certain way. This jiggling is conveyed to the brain where\nit affects the animal spirits, which in turn affect the mind, causing\nthe mind to experience one or another color, depending on the degree\nof spin and how it affects the brain. Color in objects is thus that\nproperty of their surface that causes light particles to spin in one\nway or another, and hence to cause one sensation or another. There is\nnothing else in the surface of an object, as regards color, than a\ncertain surface-shape that induces various spins in particles of\nlight. \n\nDescartes introduced this new theory of sensory qualities in the\nfirst six chapters of the World. There, he defended it by\narguing that his explanation of qualities in bodies in terms of\nsize, shape, and motion are clearly understood by comparison with the\nAristotelian qualities (11:33). Subsequently, in the\nMeditations and Principles, he defended this account\nby appeal to the metaphysical result that body possesses only\ngeometrical modes of extension. Real qualities are ruled out because\nthey are not themselves instances of size, shape, or motion (even if\npatches of color have a size and a shape, and can be moved about). \n\nIn addition to a new theory of sensory qualities, Descartes offered\ntheories of the way in which the spatial properties—size, \nshape, distance, and position—are perceived in vision. In \nDescartes' day \nand before, “optics” was \ndefined as the theory of vision,\nincluding physical, physiological, and psychological aspects. It had been\nan area of inquiry since antiquity. Euclid and Ptolemy had each written\non optical problems. During the Middle Ages, the Arabic natural\nphilosopher Ibn al-Haytham produced an important new theoretical work\nin which he offered an extensive account of the perception of \nspatial properties. \n\nThe theoretical terrain in optics changed with Kepler's doctrine that\nvision is mediated by the retinal image and that the retina is the\nsensitive body in the eye. Previous theorists generally believed that\nthe “crystalline humor,” now known as the lens, was the\nsensitive body. Descartes accepted Kepler's result and framed a new\ntheory of spatial perception. Some of his theorizing simply adapted\nIbn al-Haytham's theories to the newly discovered retinal image. Thus,\nIbn al-Haytham held that size is perceived by combining the visual\nangle that a body subtends with perception of its distance, to arrive\nat a perception of the true size of the object. (Visual angle is\nformed by the directions from a vantage point to a seen-object for a\ngiven fixation, e.g., the angle formed by the direction to the feet\nand to the nose of a person standing at moderate distance to us, with\nthe eyes fixed for the moment.) In al-Haytham's scheme, visual angle\nis registered at the surface of the crystalline humor. Descartes held\nthat size is perceived by combining visual angle with perceived\ndistance, but he now treated visual angle as the extent of an object's\nprojection onto the retina. \n\nIn Ibn al-Haytham's account, if the size of an object \nis known distance may be perceived through an inference; for a given size, \nan object's distance is inversely proportional\nto its visual angle. Descartes recognized this traditional account, depending \nas it does on past experience of an object's size \nand on an inference or rapid judgment that combines perceived visual angle \nwith known or remembered size. Descartes held that these rapid judgments are\nhabitual and happen so quickly that they go unnoticed. Further, the\nsensations that present the objects in accordance with visual angle\nalso go unnoticed, as they are rapidly replaced by visual experiences\nof objects at a distance. \n\nIbn al-Haytham also explained that distance can be perceived by \nan observer's being sensitive to the number \nof equal portions \nof ground space that lie between the observer and a distant object.\nDescartes did not adopt this explanation. However, Descartes used his\nmechanistic physiology to frame a new account of how distance might be\nperceived, a theory different from anything that could have been found\nin Ibn al-Haytham. \n\nIn Kepler's new theory of how the eye works, \nan image is formed on the\nretina as a result of refraction by the cornea and lens. For objects\nat different distances, the focal properties of the system must be\nchanged, just as the focal length of a camera is changed. There were\nseveral theories of how this might occur, but Descartes accepted the\nview that the lens changes shape \nor “accommodates” for\nnear and far vision. He then theorized that this change in the shape\nof the lens must be controlled by muscles, which themselves are\ncontrolled by nerve processes in the brain. \n\nDescartes realized that the\ncentral nervous state that controls accommodation would vary directly\nin proportion to the distance of objects. However, unlike the case of\ninferring distance from known size and visual angle, Descartes did not\nsuppose that the mind is aware of the apparatus for controlling the\naccommodation of the eye. Rather, he supposed that, by an innate\nmechanism, the central brain state that varies with distance directly\ncauses an idea of distance in the mind (6:137; 11:183). This\nphysiologically produced idea of distance could then be combined with\nperceived visual angle in order to perceive an \nobject's size, as in al-Haytham's \ntheory of size perception. When we correctly perceive the \ndistance and combine it with visual angle (by an unnoticed mental act),\nthe result is a veridical perception of a size-at-a-distance. Descartes\ndescribed the resulting perception as possessing the attributes that\nwere labelled as “size constancy” \nin the twentieth century: \n\nWhen Descartes speaks of taking into account \nthe “size of the images” on the retina,\nhe need be speaking only of visual angle, which can be taken as equivalent to\nretinal-image size. Also, in saying an object ten times farther away than a near\nobject should be a hundred times smaller, he is speaking of area; it would be\nten times smaller in linear height. Accordingly, Descartes here describes a process\nin which visual angle is combined with perceived distance in order to yield\na perceived “size at a distance” \nthat reflects the object's constant true size\nin those cases in which we correctly register and combine distance with\nvisual angle. \n\nDescartes' work on visual perception is but one instance \nof his adopting a naturalistic stance toward conscious mental experience in seeking\nto explain aspects of such experience. The Passions constitute\nanother. It is sometimes said that Descartes' dualism\nplaced the mind outside nature by rendering it as an immaterial substance. That \nis a retrospective judgment from a perspective in which immaterial substances are \nautomatically deemed “unnatural.” For\nDescartes and his followers, mind–body interaction \nand its laws were included within the domain of natural philosophy or physics \n(in the general meaning of the latter term, as the theory of nature). Descartes\nspoke of regular relations between brain states and the resulting\nsensory experiences, which his followers, such as Regis,\nsubsequently deemed “laws” \nof mind–body relation (see Hatfield 2000). In this way, \nDescartes and his followers posited the existence of psychophysical or\npsychophysiological laws, long before Gustav Fechner (1801–87) \nformulated a science of psychophysics in the nineteenth century. \nThe things that readers find valuable in Descartes' work have changed\nover the centuries. We have seen that his natural philosophy had an\nimmediate impact that lasted into the eighteenth century. His theory of\nvision was part of that heritage, as were his results in mathematics.\nWe have also seen that his mechanistic account of the psychology of the\nsensitive soul and his view that animals are like machines were revived\nin the nineteenth century. \n\nThe fortune of the metaphysical and epistemological aspects of\nDescartes' philosophy is complex. In his own time, \nhe inspired a raft\nof followers, who sought to develop his metaphysics, epistemology,\nnatural philosophy, and even to add a worked-out ethics. These authors\nincluded Geraud de Cordemoy, Arnold Geulincx, Antoine Le Grand, Nicolas\nMalebranche, Regis, and Rohault. The British philosopher\nHenry More at first followed Descartes but subsequently turned against\nhim. Other major philosophers, including Benedict de Spinoza and G. W.\nLeibniz, were influenced by Descartes' thought \nbut developed their own, distinct systems. \n\nPerhaps the most profound effect that Descartes had on early modern\nepistemology and metaphysics arose from his idea to examine the knower as\na means to determine the scope and possibilities of human\nknowledge. Among his immediate followers, Malebranche most fully\ndeveloped this aspect of Descartes' philosophy.\nSubsequent philosophers who were not followers of Descartes also\nadopted the strategy of investigating the knower. The epistemological\nworks of Locke, George Berkeley, David Hume, Thomas Reid,\nand Immanuel Kant pursued this investigation. These authors came to\ndifferent conclusions than had Descartes concerning the ability\nof the human mind to know things as they are in themselves.\nHume and Kant especially—and each in his \nown way—rejected the very notion\nof a metaphysics that reveals reality as it is in itself. They did not \nmerely deny Descartes' particular metaphysical \ntheories; they rejected his sort of metaphysical project altogether.\nBut they did so through the type of investigation that Descartes\nhimself had made prominent: the investigation of the cognitive\ncapacities of the knower. \n\nDuring the twentieth century, various aspects of Descartes'\nphilosophy were widely invoked and perhaps just as widely misinterpreted. The \nfirst is Descartes' skepticism. In the early twentieth \ncentury, one response to the threat of skepticism about our knowledge of the\nexternal world was to retreat to the position \nthat we can only know our own sense data, \nwhere “sense data” are\nequated with the supposed contents of immediate sensory experience:\nfor vision, color patches having a shape (e.g., Russell 1914). Some authors \nthen treated Descartes' project in \nthe Meditations as that of reducing human knowledge to immediate \nsense data, from which knowledge of the external world was to be constructed. \n\nAs a reading of Descartes, this position has little to offer. As we have\nseen, in the Second and Third Meditations Descartes argues from the\nindubitability of the cogito reasoning to the trustworthiness\nof intellectual perception to the existence of a perfect being\n(God). In the latter argument, he does indeed seek to infer the reality of a\nbeing external to himself. But the inference does not invoke\nsensory experience. It proceeds from a nonsensory and\ninnate idea of God to the existence of that God. Whatever one may\nthink of the quality of the argument, it has nothing to do with sense\ndata. Descartes used skeptical arguments as a tool to disengage the\nreader from the sensory world in order to undertake metaphysical\ninvestigations. There did result, in the Sixth Meditation, a\nre-evaluation of the senses in relation to metaphysics. But again,\nsense data were not in the mix. \n\nAnother line of twentieth-century interpretation also focused on the\nisolation of the subject in the Second Meditation. In the course of\nthat Meditation, Descartes accepts that he knows the contents of his\nmind, including putative sensory experiences, even though he doubts\nthe existence of his body. Some philosophers have concluded from this\nthat Descartes believed that human beings actually can, in their\nnatural state, have sensory experiences even if they lack a body. But\nDescartes in fact denied that possibility. In his metaphysics, sense\nperception and imagination depend for their existence on\nmind–body union. There can be intellectual perceptions that do\nnot depend on the brain. But acts of imagination and sense perception\nrequire the brain (Pass. I.19–20, 43). Thus, Descartes\ndid not in fact hold that we might have all of our sense experiences\neven if we had no brain. Rather, he allowed that he could conceive his\nsensory experiences independent of the brain, and that, if God were\nnot supremely good, God could produce those experiences in us\nindependent of the brain; but because God's perfection is inconsistent\nwith deceit, he would never do this. Hence, conceivability does not in\nall cases—and especially not in cases of mere ignorance, as in\nthe Second Meditation—yield metaphysical possibility (as we have\nseen in the Discourse argument for the mind–body\ndistinction). \n\nA third conception is little more than the use (or abuse) of Descartes\nas a straw-man representative of a kind of \nover-arching “Western rationality”\nthat over-rationalized the human being and denied the body and\nemotions. The claim that Descartes denied the body and the emotions\nis easily put aside. It is an over-generalization, and a misunderstanding,\nof Descartes' procedure \nof “withdrawing the mind from the\nsenses” in the Meditations for the purposes of doing\nmetaphysics. A more historically nuanced reading of Descartes'\ntext would connect it with the practice of spiritual meditation extant\nin the seventeenth century, a practice that Descartes co-opted for\nhis metaphysical meditations (see the first three chapters \nin Rorty 1986). Also, the notion that Descartes ignored the\nbody and emotions does not respond at all to his work on \nthe Passions, in which the body has a starring role. More\ngenerally, this sort of charge does not engage the long portion\nof the Sixth Meditation that concerns mind–body union\nand interaction and the embodied mind. \n\nOne recent version of this caricature suggests that Descartes had a\nnotion of human behavior that consisted of a\n“sense-represent-plan-move” cycle (Wheeler 2005,\nchap. 3). As has been mentioned, Descartes explained many human\nbehaviors through the machine of the body, without mental\nintervention.  As he said in the Fourth Replies, “When people\ntake a fall, and stick out their hands so as to protect their head, it\nis not reason that instructs them to do this” (7:230); rather,\nthe machine of the body (material processes in the sense organs,\nbrain, and muscles) produces this behavior, without any mental\ncontribution. Descartes envisioned similar purely mechanistic\nexplanations for many of the behaviors that arise from the passions or\nemotions. In this connection, the body acts first and the felt\nexperience of the passion has the function of getting the mind to want\nto do what the body is already doing\n(Pass. I.37–40). In any event, Descartes by no means\nheld that all human behavior does or should arise from rational\ndeliberation. Which is not to say that he devalued rational\ndeliberation when there is time and need to undertake it. But he was\nunder no illusion that all effective human behavior stems from reason. \n\nHow could interpreters get Descartes so wrong? One recent \nexplanation suggests that many \npost-modern “theorists”\nhave absorbed their Descartes at second hand, and the same\nexplanation might be extended to others who invoke Descartes\nafter only cursory engagement with his writings. As the\nliterary historian Michael Moriarty explains, leading\nFrench theorists such as Jacques Lacan and Michel\nFoucault would have, in the course of their French educations,\n“received a solid grounding in philosophy, \nand in Descartes' works in particular” \n(Moriarty 2003, 52). They then use Descartes\nas a stalking horse. Moriarty suggests that many\nreaders of Lacan and Foucault have not received the\nsame education in philosophy or in Descartes. Such\nindividuals, “who read Lacan or Foucault without,\nor before, reading Descartes, thus imbibe a certain\nperception of Descartes, more negative, perhaps, than the\nauthors themselves, writing against the grain of their\nown culture, may have intended to convey” \n(2003, 53). The implication is that Lacan and Foucault engaged Descartes\nfrom a knowledge of his writings, whereas others who\nlack such knowledge misunderstand the value\nof such genuine engagement and take away\nmisunderstood implications. This would also explain how \nDescartes could be charged with denying the emotions even though\nhe published an entire book on the Passions, and how\nthe implications of this book might be overlooked by someone eager\nto find a famous target to disagree with. \nLeaving aside such blatant misinterpretations, what is \nDescartes' legacy now? The breadth of his\ninfluence in the seventeenth century is permanent, including his\nspecific contributions in mathematics and optics, his vision for\na mechanistic  physiology, and the model he offered to Newton of\na unified celestial and terrestrial physics that assigns a few basic\nproperties to a ubiquitous matter the motions of which are governed\nby a few simple laws. In this regard, Descartes' \nwork offers an example of culturally engaged philosophy. Descartes had a sense \nfor the fundamental philosophical issues of his time, many of which concerned the\ntheory of nature and the attempt to found a new natural science. He not\nonly offered a systematic reformulation of the extant natural philosophy,\nbut he did so in a way that could be heard and understood. \n\nBeyond past historical influences, Descartes'\nphilosophy continues to speak to us now and to offer new insights to new\ngenerations of philosophers who are in position to hear what he said. This\ncan be seen in the revival of body-first theories of the emotions. (Ironically,\nsome of Descartes' most vocal detractors among\nscientists who study the emotions, including Damasio 1994, espouse theories similar \nin many respects to Descartes' own, on \nwhich, see Hatfield 2007.) Further, his theories of sensory qualities\nhave inspired new reflections (Simmons 2003), as has his account of distance\nperception (see Wolf-Devine 1993 and the entries on optics and perception in\nNolan 2014). More generally, his Meditations is one of the most\nfinely crafted examples of philosophical prose in the entire history of\nphilosophy. That in itself ensures its ongoing relevance. \n\nIn the end, Descartes' legacy partly consists of problems he raised,\nor brought into prominence, but did not solve. The mind–body\nproblem is a case in point. Descartes himself argued from his ability\nclearly and distinctly to conceive mind and body as distinct beings to\nthe conclusion that they really are separate substances. Most\nphilosophers today accept neither the methodological basis for his\nclaim nor the claim itself. Indeed, since the time of Kant, few\nphilosophers have believed that the clear and distinct thoughts of the\nhuman mind are a guide to the absolute reality of things. Hence, the\nnotion that even clear conceivability discerns metaphysical\npossibility is not accepted. Moreover, few philosophers today are\nsubstance dualists. \n\nAll the same, the mind–body problem persists. In distinguishing\nthe domain of the mental from that of the physical, Descartes struck a\nchord. Many philosophers accept the conceptual distinction, but remain\nuncertain of the underlying metaphysics: whether mind is identical\nwith brain; or the mental emerges from complex processes in the brain;\nor constitutes a property that is different from any purely physical\nproperty, even while being instantiated by the brain. In this case, a\nproblem that Descartes made prominent has lived far beyond his\nproposed solution.","contact.mail":"hatfield@phil.upenn.edu","contact.domain":"phil.upenn.edu"}]
