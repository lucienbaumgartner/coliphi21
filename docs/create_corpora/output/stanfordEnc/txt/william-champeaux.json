His\nstaunch defense of realism in logic and metaphysics earned him a\nreputation as a preeminent philosopher of the late eleventh and early\ntwelfth centuries. William was a student of Anselm of Laon, and, like\nothers from his school, he was committed to the view that articles of\nfaith are beyond the capacity of human reason to understand and human\nlanguage to explain. He was recognized in his day as one of the\ncontinent's most influential theologians. These philosophical and\ntheological commitments fueled the conflict with his most famous\nstudent, Peter Abelard, a conflict that was continued between Abelard\nand William's most famous protégé, Bernard of\nClairvaux.\n\n\n\nHistory is written by the winners. Most of what we know of William of\nChampeaux's life and work has been refracted down to us through the\nprism of a man who hated him. Peter Abelard lost almost every battle\nwith William, his teacher and political enemy, yet he tells us that\nWilliam was a discredited, defeated, jealous, and resentful man.\nAbelard claims to have humiliated William in debate, driving him from\nthe Paris schools. He alleges that, in defeat, William cast himself in\nthe role of monastic reformer only to advance his political career by\nan unearned reputation for piety. Still, even Abelard recognized that\nWilliam was no fraud, calling him \"first in reputation and in fact,\"\nand relocating to study under his tutelage (HC; trans. Radice\n1974). \n\nOn the scholarly front, Abelard presents only half the story. He brags\nof forcing William to abandon a firmly-held realist theory of\nuniversals, but, rather than come over to Abelard's vocalist or\nnominalist cause, William developed a second, more sophisticated,\nrealist view. So what might have appeared as an expression of\nintellectual honesty and academic rigor on William's part, Abelard\npresents as somehow shameful. What Abelard leaves out is how much he\nlearned from William. Now that more of William's work has become\navailable, it is clear that William prodded Abelard to give up\nnaïve vocalism and develop the complex semantic theory we now\nassociate with Abelard's nominalism. \n\nThe extent of William's and Abelard's involvement on opposite sides of\nthe major political struggles of the day is also beginning to come to\nlight. William was a man of considerable influence in the monastic\nreform movement. Abelard was a man of considerably less influence\nallied with the opposite faction. It is probably true that Abelard\nattracted the better students and so precipitated William's move from\nParis to St. Victor. But far from retiring in shame, William became a\nstatesman, ambassador, and confidant to the Pope, all the while\nretaining enough political clout to prevent Abelard from either\nholding his former chair as canon of Notre Dame or establishing a\nschool in Paris. One recent biographer of Abelard points out that in\n1119, while Abelard was recovering from his castration and was soon to\nbe facing charges of heresy, William was a bishop acting as papal\nnegotiator to the court of Emperor Henry V.  Unfortunately for\nWilliam's reputation, it was Abelard whose writings captured the\nimagination of readers in later centuries (Clanchy 1997: 296ff). \n\nVery little is known about William's early life and education.  The\ndate usually assigned for his birth is 1070, but this may be off by as\nmuch as a decade. In 1094 leaders of the monastic reform movement\nappointed William as Master of Notre Dame. If this date is correct, he\nwould have been only 24 at the time, and this was a crucial moment for\nthe reformers. In 1094 King Philip I had been excommunicated for his\n\"illegal marriage,\" and any person appointed to be Master at Notre\nDame would have to have been an established scholar with considerable\npolitical influence, something not usually found in 24\nyear-olds. Thus, a date of 1060 or earlier may not be unlikely for\nWilliam's birth (Iwakuma forthcoming c). \n Little is known of William's education before he took this important\npost.  He is known to have studied with Anselm of Laon and a certain\nManegold, but it is unclear whether this was the theologian, Manegold\nof Lautenbach, or the grammarian, Manegold of Chartres. It is even\nsuspected that William studied with the vocalist Roscelin of\nCompiègne. \n Early in the first decade of the twelfth century, probably in 1104,\nWilliam became archdeacon of Paris. In 1108 the reformist party\nreceived a setback when King Luis VI, King Philip's son by his\n\"illegal marriage\" ascended the throne. William resigned as archdeacon\nto move to the abbey of St. Victor and the Paris suburbs, where he\ncontinued to teach and remained an influential reformer. Both Hugh of\nSt. Victor and Bernard of Clairvaux were among William's\nprotégés from this period at St. Victor. \n In 1113, he was appointed bishop of Châlons-sur-Marne. He\ncontinued to act as papal legate and negotiator and remained\ninfluential in the reform movement, particularly through his patronage\nof Bernard of Clairvaux. His continued scholarly reputation is\ndemonstrated in the somewhat ludicrous tale of Rupert of Duetz, who,\nin 1117, set himself on a quest to challenge William of Champeaux and\nAnselm of Laon to intellectual combat (Clanchy 1997: 143). On January\n18, 1122, William took the habit of a Cistercian and died at Clairvaux\neight days later. \n William's corpus of writings is not widely available and a great deal\nmore textual work needs to be done before any assessment can be made\nabout his broader philosophical significance. Nevertheless, his basic\nphilosophical commitments and some of his characteristic views are\nknown. The texts we do have indicate that he started his career as a\nrealist in matters of logic and metaphysics and that his commitment to\nrealism grew stronger with the appearance of the vocalists and early\nnominalists. Thanks to Abelard's criticisms, William is best known for\nhis realist theories of universals. In response to the vocalist\nchallenge, he seems to have held something like the Cratylus\ntheory of language: the nature of words is intimately tied to the\nnature of the things they name. In logic, some vocalists claimed that\nthe force of inference arises from words or ideas, but William argued\nthat this is to be found instead in some thing or relation between\nthings, which he identified as the locus or medium of\nargument. He interpreted Aristotle's Categories as ten\ngeneral things, not ten general words as the vocalists\nmaintained. These and other claims suggest a broadly realist\nphilosophical outlook. It is possible that fragments and excerpts of\nWilliam's work passed down to us by his near contemporaries are those\nin which he was debating with the vocalists, and so we do not know\nwhether they represent William's deepest commitments or only brief\nforays into an important debate. \n William's views are known mostly through references in contemporary\nworks, especially those of Abelard. Though several of William's works\nhave been identified, very few have been edited, and none has been\ntranslated into English. The Introductions —\nIntroductiones dialecticae secundum Wilgelmum \n(ISW)  and Introductiones dialecticae secundum magistrum G.\nPaganellum (IGP) — are very early works, possibly dating\nfrom William's arrival in Paris in 1094. Edited with these two\nIntroductions are two brief discussions of media or\nloci, and the beginning of an early commentary on Porphyry,\nall likely by William (Iwakuma 1993; ISW is also in de Rijk 1967).\nThese texts defend some of William's characteristic doctrines, but in\n1094 the vocalist movement had not yet begun to exert any real\ninfluence in Paris, and so it is likely that he had not yet been\nforced to articulate his views in response to serious criticism. \n Some of William's later works have also been identified. Although no\neditions have been published, several articles contain extensive\nexcerpts. William is known to have written commentaries on Porphyry's\nIsagoge, Aristotle's Categories and De\nInterpretatione, Boethius' De Differentiis\nTopicis, and Cicero's De Inventione and\nRhetorica ad Herennium.  Some of his theological writings,\nalong with those of other leading French theologians, were compiled in\nthe later twelfth century under the title Liber\nPancrisis. These have been edited as the\n‘Sententiae’ of William of Champeaux (Lottin\n1956). The Liber Pancrisis is thought to be a\ncompilation of the best Parisian theology of the period, and so it is\nlikely to represent William's most advanced views. \n\nThe history of philosophy remembers William for his two theories of\nuniversals, material essence realism and indifference\nrealism.  These theories emerge from the writings of Peter\nAbelard, where they are paired with Abelard's decisive arguments\nagainst them. Indeed, Abelard's critique was so powerful that when\nJohn of Salisbury wrote his famous catalogue of twelfth-century\ntheories of universals, William is not even mentioned\n(Metalogicon II 17-20; Abelard LI Por.: 10-16, trans. Spade\n1994: 29-37; see also\n John of Salisbury,\n Peter Abelard, and\n King 2004) \n Material essence realism proposes that there are ten most general\nthings or essences: one most general thing corresponding to each of\nAristotle's ten categories. These essences are universal things:  \n These ten genera exist and are to some degree unformed. They are\nformed into subalternate genera and species by the addition of\ndifferentia. Species are formed into individuals by the addition of\naccidental forms: \"a species is nothing other than a formed genus, an\nindividual nothing other than a formed species\" (P3; Marenbon 2004:\n33; Iwakuma 2004: 309; Fredborg 1977: 35). This is how the view gets\nits name. The genus exists as the matter. The difference forms the\ngenus \"into a sub-altern genus which in turn becomes the matter for an\ninferior sub-altern genus or species. The addition of accidental forms\ndivides the species into discrete individuals\" [et fiant res\ndiscretae in actu rerum] (C8; Iwakuma 1999: 103). The\nindividuals in a species or genus thus share a single material\nessence. \n Everything in the created world is an accidentally differentiated\nindividual, but this is an incidental feature of the created world,\nand by no means a commitment to concretism. Universal essences exist;\nthey are simply never found except as accidentally differentiated, qua\nindividuals. \n\nThis mental exercise of stripping away forms does not merely produce a\nuniversal concept. It reveals the underlying metaphysical\nreality. There is a real universal thing corresponding to our\nuniversal concepts. It is this principle of a single universal\nsubstance individuated by accidents that Abelard reduces to\nabsurdity. \n When faced with Abelard's arguments against material essence realism,\nWilliam gave up his belief in universal essences but refused to accept\nthat universals are simply words or concepts. Indifference realism\nrejects the core principle of material essence realism by rejecting\nthe notion that there are shared essences and holding that individuals\nare completely discrete from one another. \n The words ‘one’ and ‘same’ are ambiguous,\nWilliam says: \"when I say Plato and Socrates are the same I might\nattribute identity of wholly the same essence or I might simply mean\nthat they do not differ in some relevant respect.\"  William's newfound\nambiguity is the seed of his second theory of universals. The stronger\nsense of ‘one’ and ‘same’ applies to\nPeter/Simon and Saul/Paul (we would say Cicero/Tully), who \"are one\nand the same according to identity\" (Sen 236.123). As for Plato and\nSocrates: \n\nSo, although Plato and Socrates have no common material—matter,\nform, or universal essence—they are still said to be the same\nbecause they do not differ. This leads to the claim that Abelard finds\nso disturbing. Each individual is both universal and\nparticular: Those things which per se are considered many and wholly\ndiverse in essence are one considered in general or specific nature.\nThat is, they do not differ in being man (esse\nhominem). \n\nOne Man is many men, taken particularly. Those which are one\nconsidered in a special nature are many considered particularly. That\nis to say, without accidents they are considered one per\nindifference, with accidents many. \n\nIt should never be said that many men make one Man. Rather it should\nbe said that many men agree in being, in what it is to be a man\n(in esse hoc quod est esse homo). Nevertheless, they are\nwholly diverse in essence (P14; Iwakuma 1999: 119). \n Indifference realism is not a complete departure from material\nessence realism because William still accepts accidental\nindividuation. When the accidents are stripped away, Plato and\nSocrates are still one and the same although in the weaker sense of\n‘one’ and ‘same’. They do not share a material\nessence, though they each have the same state or status of\nbeing a man.  William's indifference realism holds that when\nindividuating accidents are stripped away from two individuals, what\nyou are left with may be numerically distinct but it is not\nindividually discernible (you can't tell which one is Socrates). What\nis left then are pure things—there are no individuating\ncharacteristics. In this sense, each thing is itself a universal. \n\nWith so few of William's works identified and even fewer properly\nedited and published, any serious discussion of his views on logic is\nyears away. What follows is a brief presentation of William's thoughts\non various issues. In many cases, these are gleaned from references in\nother texts, mostly by Abelard.  These references indicate that\nWilliam was a wide-ranging and serious thinker, but much as with the\nPre-Socratics, we have just seen just the tip of the iceberg as far as\nhis actual writings are concerned. \n\nLogic is the art of discerning truth from falsehood and of making and\njudging arguments (ISW I 1.1; IGP I 1.1). The study of logic must\ntherefore begin with the study of words. The Introductions,\nISW and IGP, first define sounds, significant sounds, words, phrases\n(orationes), and sentences, then proceed to detailed\ndiscussion of complex hypothetical and categorical sentences and\nsyllogisms. William's approach here became a model for twelfth-century\nlogic textbooks. \n\nWilliam accepts the standard medieval definition of signification: a\nsound is significant if it generates an understanding in the mind of a\nhearer. Judging by William's discussion, there was some debate at the\nend of the eleventh century as to whether signification required that\na spoken word actually, as opposed to merely potentially, generate an\nunderstanding in the mind of a hearer. Actual signification is too\nstrong a criterion, but every sound potentially generates an\nunderstanding, even if only in the mind of the person uttering\nit. William argues that once a word is imposed—and a convention\nestablished—the word is significant because it is apt to signify\nwhenever it is uttered (Iwakuma 1999 p109; forthcoming b). William's\nviews on the conditions for imposing words are not yet fully\nknown. The vocalists seem to have held that absent a linguistic\nconvention, there is no connection between any sound and what it is\nimposed to signify, a view shared by Abelard (see Guilfoy 2002). On\nthe other hand William held that \"there is such an affinity between\nwords and things that words draw their properties from things and so\nthe nature of words is shown more clearly through the nature of\nthings\" (P14; Marenbon 1996: 6). \n\nWilliam clearly invites controversy by claiming that the only\nsignificant sounds, that is, the only words, are those that are\nimposed to name presently existing things: \n That word is significant which is imposed on an existing thing, like\n‘Man’; that word is not significant which is imposed on a\nnon-existing thing, like ‘chimaera’, ‘blictrix’, and\n‘hircocervus’ (IGP I 2.2). \n A significant word is one whose significatum is found among\nexisting things (ISW I 1.4). \n\nTo claim that ‘chimaera’ is the equivalent to\n‘blictrix’ implies that ‘chimaera’ is equally\nmeaningless. The view that significant words must name existing things\npresents obvious and difficult cases because we can utter true or\nfalse sentences about things that never existed or that no longer\nexist. In such cases, William claims that words have a figurative\nsignification. ‘Chimaeras are imaginary’ figuratively\nexpresses the sentence ‘Some mind has the imagination of a\nchimaera’ (Abelard D 136.32; Kneale and Kneale 1962:\n207). ‘Homer is a poet’ is properly understood\nfiguratively as ‘Homer's work, which he wrote in his role as\npoet, exists’ (H9; Iwakuma 1999: 113; Abelard D 136.14ff,\n168.11ff). \n\nAbelard attributes to William the view that words signify all things\nthat they were imposed to name (Abelard D 112.24). Other texts\nindicate that William might have believed this. An anonymous text\nattributes to William the view that ‘all’ signifies all\nthings simultaneously (H13; Iwakuma 1999: 111). However, it is also\npossible that Abelard misunderstood or misrepresented William (Iwakuma\n1999: 107). \n\nIt is reported that William held a similar view of infinite terms.\nWilliam is said to have argued that an infinite term, e.g.,\n‘non-man’, signifies all those things that are not men\n(H13; Iwakuma 1999: 109). However, William's own discussion of\ninfinite terms is available. In the Introductions William\nargues that the signification of infinite terms can be taken\naffirmatively, negatively, or correctly (ISW I 4.2). Taken\naffirmatively ‘non-man’ positively signifies every thing\nthat is not a man: each rock, flower, and squirrel. The affirmative\naccount allows one to substitute ‘stone’ for\n‘non-man’ in syllogisms with absurd results. Taking\ninfinite terms negatively solves this problem by claiming that\ninfinite terms do not signify any existing thing, but William cannot\naccept this because it would mean that infinite terms are not\nsignificant. Rather, he argues that the imposition of infinite terms\nis related to the imposition of their correlative terms. \n\nBecause the remotive imposition of the infinite term\n‘non-animal’ is related to the positive imposition of the\nterm ‘animal’, the infinite term does not signify stone in the\nway the word ‘stone’ would. So although William holds that\nthe same thing is signified, the mode of signification would preclude\nsubstitution of positive and infinite terms. \n\nAbelard criticizes William for \"doing such abuse to language\" that he\nallowed ‘rational’ and ‘rational animal’ to\nsignify the same thing (Abelard D 541.24). Again, another anonymous\nsource confirms that William thought that a definition and the term\ndefined, that is ‘rational mortal animal’ and\n‘man’, signify the same thing (Green-Pedersen 1974,\nfrag. 6). Both are consistent with William's theories of universals\nand may reflect William's commitment to words signifying presently\nexisting things. William may well have thought that\n‘rational’ and ‘rational animal’ have the same\nsignification because each thing signified by ‘rational’\nis signified by ‘rational animal’, and conversely. Such a view\nwould involve a fairly simplistic theory of meaning, but this alone\ndoes not mean it was not William's view. \n\nSome aspects of William's theory of signification are considerably\nmore complex. He developed a theory of two modes of signification of\nquality terms: \n\nAbelard confirms that William made this sort of distinction. As\nAbelard describes it, William held that ‘white’ signifies\nthe white individual and also whiteness. ‘White’ signifies\nthe subject (fundamentum) by denoting (nominando)\nit. It signifies whiteness by determining it in the subject\n(determinando circa fundamentum) (Abelard LI Top:\n272.14). But at the present time, not enough material is available to\nbegin to flesh out William's account of signification by denotation\nand signification by determination. \n\nWilliam had several different views on the interpretation of different\nkinds of sentences. That he held the views is not much in dispute;\nthey are attributed to him by several contemporaries and some are\nfound in his own works. But the possible philosophical relation\nbetween them is a matter of speculation.  William held that sentences have two senses, a grammatical sense\nand a dialectical sense. Taken in the grammatical sense, the verb in\nsentences such as ‘Socrates is white’ marks an\nintransitive copulation of essence: the same thing is denoted by the\nsubject and predicate. In the dialectical sense, the verb in\n‘Socrates is white’ marks a predication of inherence: what\nis denoted by the predicate inheres in what is denoted by the\nsubject. To the grammarian, ‘Socrates is white’ and\n‘Socrates is whiteness’ have different senses and\ndifferent truth conditions. ‘Socrates is white’ says that\nSocrates is a subject of whiteness.  ‘Socrates is\nwhiteness’ says that Socrates is essentially whiteness. To the\ndialectician, however, the two sentences have the same sense, since\nthey both say that whiteness inheres in Socrates. The dialectical\nsense is more general (generalior, largior,\nsuperior) because it does not distinguish between essential\nand accidental inherence. But the grammatical sense is more precise\n(determinatior). Taken in the dialectical sense,\n‘Socrates is white’ and ‘Socrates is\nwhiteness’ would both be true. So, while the dialectical sense\nhas some use for dialecticians, sentences are true and false in the\ngrammatical sense (Abelard LI Top: 271-273; GP 1974 Frag 9; de Rijk\n1967 II.I: 183-85). \n\nAccording to William, maximal propositions contain or signify all the\npropositions under them. Thus, the maxim, ‘Of whatever the\nspecies is predicated the genus is also predicated’ signifies or\ncontains the sentences ‘If it is a man it is an animal’,\n‘If it is a rock it is a substance’, etc. Only the most general\nform is truly a maximal proposition, but it is the more precise\n(certior) sentences contained under the maxim that provide\nthe inferential force for particular arguments. William may have\ndeveloped this view in response to the vocalists. Abelard explains\nthat multiple senses are needed given William's view that things, not\nwords, warrant inference; only the more precise formulations can\nsignify the things themselves (Abelard LI Top: 231.26-238.34). An\nanonymous author confirms Abelard's understanding of William's\nview. The argument, ‘Socrates is a man therefore Socrates is an\nanimal’ is warranted by the topical maxim noted above. It is not\nthe maxim itself but the more precise version contained in it,\n‘If it is a man it is an animal’, that provides the force for\nthis particular inference. According to this text, William argued that\nit is not the words (voces) or the sense\n(intellectus) of the more precise sentence that provides the\ninferential force, but the fact that the more precise sentence\nsignifies relations (habitudines) between things\n(Green-Pedersen 1974: Frag 8;10;12). \n\nWilliam divides the standard A, E, I, and O sentences according to\nwhat he calls the matter of the sentence materia\npropositionis). The matter of the sentence is determined by the\nrelationship between what is signified as the subject and the\npredicate. Each standard-form sentence is found in one of three\nmatters: natural, contingent, or remotive. In a sentence of natural\nmatter the predicate inheres universally in the subject: ‘All\nmen are animals’. In a sentence of contingent matter the\npredicate inheres in the subject, but not universally: ‘All men\nare white’. In sentences of remotive matter the predicate in no way\ninheres in the subject: ‘All men are stones’. The validity\nof direct inferences between contraries, subalterns, etc. depends on\nthe matter of the sentences involved. In all matter, contraries cannot\nboth be true. So regardless of the matter, if an A sentence is true\nthe corresponding E sentence is false. In natural and remotive matter,\nif either the A or E sentence is false the other must be true: if\n‘No men are animals’ is false then ‘All men are\nanimals’ must be true. However, in contingent matter both\nsentences may be false. It is possible for both ‘All men are\nwhite’ and ‘No men are white’ to be false. William\ngives a similar treatment for contradictories, subcontraries, and\nsubalterns (ISW I 3-3.3; II 1.1-1.3; IGP I 5.4-5.6). \n\nContemporary logicians recognize a difference between arguments and\ntheir corresponding conditionals. But they accept that an\nargument: \n\nand its corresponding conditional: \n\nare equivalent by the deduction theorem. (2) in turn is interderivable\nwith: \n\nThese logical relationships were all in dispute during the twelfth\ncentury. (Iwakuma 2004b presents these distinctions and discusses\nWilliam's role in the debate.) Logicians at that time attributed much\nmore significance to the distinction between arguments and\nconditionals, and most did not accept what we would now recognize as\nthe formal rules of material implication. Along these lines, several\nviews were attributed to William as characteristic of his logical\nprogram, but his arguments in the available texts do not reflect what\nothers say about him. So, once again, the extent of William's\ninfluence is unclear. \n\nWilliam accepted that (1) and (2) are equivalent, but not for any\nmetalogical reason. He thought that syllogisms were phrases\n(orationes) that contain the senses of several other\nsentences. The view attributed to William is that syllogisms and\narguments are, as he puts it \"subcontinuatives\"\n[subcontinuativa] containing other sentences. ‘Socrates\nis a man; therefore, Socrates is an animal’ contains the sense\nof the sentences ‘Socrates is a man’, ‘Socrates is\nan animal’ and, ‘If Socrates is a man, then Socrates is an\nanimal’ (B9 2.1 ed. Iwakuma 2004b: 102; this is the same text as\nGreen-Pedersen 1974, frag 2). William calls the contained sentences\n‘continuatives [continuativa]’. He also treats\nall syllogisms as conditionals of type (2) rather than type (3). There\nis no argument for his preference, at least not in the Introductions,\nand none of the available sources give his reasons.  At present all\nthat can be said is that William seems to have had a hand in the\norigins of a debate that raged during the twelfth century and was not\nrevived until the twentieth. \n\nWilliam introduces several novelties in his discussion of loci. Most\nsignificantly, he limits his discussion of the traditional Boethian\ntopics to the loci from the whole, part, opposites, equals, and\nimmediates. He also introduces loci from the subject and from the\npredicate into his discussion of categorical arguments. Both moves\nwere controversial. \n\nWilliam sometimes refers to the locus as ‘the medium’, by which\nhe does not necessarily mean the middle term but rather the thing that\nacts as a link between the extremes of an argument. He also called the\nlocus ‘the argument’, by which he means that the locus provides\nthe argumentative or inferential force. But whichever name he chooses,\nWilliam's realist commitment is evident. \n\nIn the Introductions, William calls loci \"words\" [voces], but\nthey are words denoting the things themselves or their relations\n(habitudines) (IGP I 7).  But William is not clear about the\nimportance of this distinction between things and relations. Fragments\nof his later work report that he was quite careful to distinguish his\nview from any brand of vocalism. He distinguished the word\n(vox), the understanding or meaning of the word\n(intellectus), and the thing itself denoted by the word, and\nheld that the thing itself is the locus. (Green-Pedersen 1974: frag\n3,4) \n\nIn categorical syllogisms, William introduces the locus from subject,\npredicate, both subject and predicate, and from the whole (ISW II 2.2;\nIGP I 8ff; see Stump 1989: 117ff). Thus, the argument \n\nis warranted by the locus from the predicate. The predicate of the\nfirst sentence is the link or medium between the extreme terms in the\nconclusion. In this case, animal (presumably the universal\nthing itself) is the locus or seat of the argument. The rule is, if\nsomething is predicated of some subject universally, then whatever is\nremoved universally from the predicate is removed universally from the\nsubject (William provides a lengthy set of rules describing the\nlogical relations that hold between subjects and predicates). As\ndescribed above, William holds that such maximal propositions contain\nthe sense of those propositions that fall under them. The rule\ncontains sentences signifying the relations between man and animal and\nbetween animal and stone (IGP I 8.4). The relations of animal\nto the extremes warrant the inference. \n\nWilliam provides a similar account of hypothetical syllogisms. He\nintroduces several loci and rules, but these are not formal\nrules. What ultimately warrants any hypothetical syllogism is the same\nsort of derivative signification of an extra-mental thing or\nrelation. Provided Socrates is risible, ‘Socrates is a\nman’ is true. The following hypothetical syllogism is warranted\nby the locus from the consequent: \n\nThe rule is: whatever follows from the consequent follows from the\nantecedent. In this case, the consequent is ‘Socrates is a\nman’, and the antecedent is ‘Socrates is\nrisible’. This looks like a formal rule: \n but William does not present it as such. ‘Socrates is risible\n→ Socrates is a man’ is warranted by the locus from equals,\nand ‘Socrates is man → Socrates is an animal’ is\nwarranted by the locus from the part (IGP I 9.2). The conclusion,\n‘Socrates is risible → Socrates is an animal’, is\narrived at via topical reasoning, not by formal rules of\ninference. This is the basis for much of the later criticism of his\nwork. Abelard in particular derives contradictions from his views by\ntreating William's loci as formal rules of inference (see Martin\n2004). \n\nAbelard reports that William thought that all modality was de\ndicto (or, in Abelard's terminology, de sensu) \n The extent to which this attribution is accurate is unclear. The view\nis at least superficially inconsistent with William's realism and\nanti-vocalism in all other areas. Additionally, Abelard was among the\nfirst to recognize the importance of the de dicto / de\nre distinction; the issue may be fairly confused in William's\nwork, as it was in many others. On the other hand, several anonymous\ntexts attribute to William the claim that ‘possibly’ and\nother modal terms modify the signification of other words in a\nsentence. Thus, ‘bishop’ signifies actual and existing\nbishops, but ‘possible bishop’ has a figurative sense\nsignifying all those things whose nature is not repugnant with being a\nbishop (Iwakuma 1999: 112). This is not necessarily a rejection of\nde re modality, but again, more of William's work needs to be\nstudied. \n\nWilliam's ethics starts with two generally accepted early medieval\nclaims: (1) evil is not any positively existing thing but only the\nprivation of good (Sen 277.1); (2) every act or event that occurs is\nperformed or condoned by God and therefore good (Sen 277.11-15). These\nlead William, among others, to situate moral good and evil in the\nhuman mind. \n\nTo this end, William names the elements of a fairly complex moral\npsychology: vice, desire/lust, pleasure, will, intention, and consent.\nAny or all of these elements might play a role in sinful behavior.\nVice itself is not necessarily bad, since the vices are not acquired\nhabits but inborn dispositions. Vices incline us to bad behavior but\ndo not necessarily compel the will: there is no sin unless we consent\nto the behavior the vice inclines us toward (Sen 278.10). Carnal\ndesire, lust, and pleasure, on the other hand, are always morally\nbad. William writes extensively about sexual lust and pleasure,\nespecially as they are involved in the transmission of original\nsin. Before the fall, sex was no more pleasurable than \"putting your\nfinger in your mouth\" (Sen. 254). In our fallen condition, however,\nlust and pleasure can never be removed from the act. Because our\n\"ability\" to experience this pleasure is the result of original sin,\nthe pleasure itself is always culpable. Consent to a sexual act under\nthe proper circumstances—e.g., between lawful spouses for the\npurpose of procreation—only lessens the gravity of the sin (Sen\n255; 246).  In William's moral psychology, will, intention, and\nconsent are the undifferentiated elements of voluntary action. These\nplay the most significant role, but sin is not exclusively in the\nwill, consent, or intention. \n\nOur best hope to avoid sin is to will what is right for the right\nreasons. However, when it comes to discovering what is right, and\ntherefore what ought to be willed, we start out at a disadvantage. The\nhuman mind naturally has the power to discern good and evil (Sen\n253.10; IGP II 4), but one of the effects of the Fall is that our\nrational capacities have been clouded and diminished. Before the Fall\nthe senses were subject to reason; after the Fall this is reversed\n(Sen 253.12-15), for since then the mind has become more closely\nattached and even enslaved to the body. This is the fomes of\nsin, a carnal weakness that clouds our reason and makes us more\ninclined to sin (Sen 246.39).  Fear, not reason, is the key for\nWilliam, since \"fear is the beginning of all wisdom\"\n(Sen. 276.1). William describes three kinds of fear (Sen\n276.17-34). First is the natural fear of danger and pain; even Jesus\nwas subject to this fear. Second is fear of losing material things or\nthe fear of punishment in hell. This fear shows that one values\ncomfort and material things more that goodness and justice.  People\nmotivated by this second fear will act rightly out of fear of losing\nmaterial goods or fear of the torments of hell, but not out of good or\nright intention: \"he does not merit grace who serves not his love of\njustice but his love of things or his fear of punishment\" (Sen\n261.23-25). Third is the fear that arises from respect for God's\njustice and power. This respectful fear of God, with knowledge of our\nown weakness and fallibility, \"is better called the love of God\" (Sen\n276.39-43). This humble fear of God should be our guide to what is\nright. \n\nWilliam's influence on Abelard here is obvious. Primarily, William and\nperhaps others from the school of Anselm of Laon were responsible for\nthe delineating the complex moral psychology that is at the core of\nAbelard's ethics. The major differences are with regard to reason and\nresponsibility. Because of our fallen state, William has little regard\nfor the ability of human reason to correctly discern what is\ngood. William is also content to prove that evil is no thing by\nsituating its source somehow in the human mind. He is not interested\nin showing that we are responsible, only that we, and not God, are\naccountable. Our will, like our mind and body, is defective and we\nsuffer the consequences of its failures. It is Abelard who takes this\nmoral psychology and develops from it a theory of moral\nresponsibility. \n\nWilliam is committed to the belief that the mysteries of faith are\nbeyond the scope of human reason, but this does not prevent him from\ndiscussing the issues philosophically and using his skill as a\nlogician to prove his point. \n\nThe problem of free will and divine foreknowledge is familiar: if\nGod's foreknowledge is infallible, then future events, including the\nactions of human beings, all happen of necessity; on the other hand,\nif future events,including the actions of human beings, could occur\notherwise, then God's foreknowledge would fallible. William denies\nboth propositions. With regard to the first he offers two\narguments. He claims that God foresees the whole range of possible\nchoices and infallibly foreknows which option free creatures will\nchoose (Sen 237; 238). The event itself is not necessary; in fact, God\ninfallibly foresees that the event is not necessary. He then adds an\ninteresting claim about future contingent propositions: they are\ndeterminately true or false, but it is the infallibility of divine\nforeknowledge that makes them so. The future event itself which the\nproposition is about does not yet exist and is indeterminate\n(eventus rerum de quibus agitur indeterminate) (Sen\n238.36). William seems to hold both that the future is indeterminate\nand that God's foreknowledge is determinately true or false. \n\nThe second proposition, ‘if future events, including the actions\nof human beings, could occur otherwise, then God's foreknowledge is\nfallible’, was interpreted in several ways by William's\ncontemporaries. Some held that if the event could occur otherwise God\nwould be fallible. Others held that because the event could occur\notherwise God actually is fallible (see Mews 2005: 135). The former\nwould reject the claim that the event could occur otherwise, but the\nlatter would simply reject divine infallibility, arguing rather that\nGod is just very lucky epistemically. Both views are theologically\nsuspect, of course, and William argued that both inferences are\ninvalid.  But he does so by introducing an unexplained modal intuition\nthat in context looks question-begging: the inference from ‘the\nevent could occur otherwise’ to ‘God is or could be\ndeceived’ is not necessary. It is possible that the former be\ntrue and the latter false because \"it is never necessary that the\nimpossible follow from the possible, and it is impossible for God to\nbe, or to have been, deceived\" (Sen 237.68). \n\nWilliam deftly avoids the overreaching that got philosophers like\nRoscelin and Abelard into such trouble. He outlines a theory of\nmetaphorical language for describing God, and argues that the\nfundamental relations of the Trinity are beyond the powers of the\nhuman mind to comprehend. \n\nPredicates such as good, just, etc.,when applied to God have a\nmetaphorical rather than their usual literal meaning. As described\nabove, William argued that all significant words are imposed to name\nexisting things in the world and these words generate sound\nunderstandings of those things they were imposed to signify. When we\nimpose the word ‘just’ or ‘good’ to name a\njust or good person, we do so because justice or goodness is in some\nway a quality of that person or her actions. God, on the other hand,\nis goodness itself and justice itself. The dignity and power of God\ncannot be grasped by human reason and so we cannot even conceive of\nGod sufficiently to accurately impose words that name divine\nattributes: \"words imposed for human use are used metaphorically for\nspeaking about God\" [ad loquendum de Deo transferuntur] (Sen\n236.46). \n\nWhenever he discusses the Trinity, William associates the Father with\npower, the Son with wisdom and the Holy Spirit with love. But this\nmetaphor is not intended to help us toward rational understanding of\nthe Trinity, or to provide a clear delineation of properties of the\nthree ersons in any way that would allow an explanation of their\nrelations and differences. William argues that there is nothing like\nthe Trinity in the created world and so there is nothing the human\nmind is able to comprehend that could be used as an analogue for\nexplaining the fundamental relation of the Trinity, three persons\nirreducibly present in one substance: \"I do not see by what quality I\nwould be able to explain this, since nothing similar can be found in\nthe nature of any thing\" (Sen 236.86). William rejects Augustine's\nmetaphors of the sun and sunshine and the mind and reason. Sunshine is\nan accident of the air and is no part of the substance of the\nsun. Likewise, reason is a power of the mind and not its substance\n(Sen 236.101). William also explains that neither of his theories of\nuniversals can be applied to explain the sameness and difference of\nthe divine persons. Material essence realism would imply that the\npersons in the Godhead are accidentally individuated, and this is\nunacceptable. The indifference theory would require the non-identity\nof three separate substances, which is also contrary to the teaching\nof the faith. What is William's ultimate conclusion?  \"Because no\nlikeness <to any created thing> could be described, the Trinity\nmust be defended by faith alone\" (Sen 236.91)."}]
