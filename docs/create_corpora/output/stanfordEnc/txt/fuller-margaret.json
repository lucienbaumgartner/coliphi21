She belonged to the New England intellectual community called\nthe transcendentalists, who also included Ralph Waldo Emerson and\nHenry David Thoreau. Her most important written work is Woman in\nthe Nineteenth Century (1845), an expansion of her article\nentitled “The Great Lawsuit: Man versus Men, Woman\nversus Women” (1843). Fuller is remembered not only for\nher writings, but also for her life: a series of undertakings to live\nup to her own ideal of transcending the then customary gender\ndifferentiations. This article will present a summary of her\nphilosophy and also take note of the various ways in which she sought\n(or did not seek) to implement her philosophical ideals.\n\n\nMargaret Fuller was born in Cambridgeport, Massachusetts, on 23 May\n1810, the eldest child of Timothy Fuller and Margarett\nCrane Fuller. (Cambridgeport is now part of Cambridge,\nMassachusetts, and the Margaret Fuller House where she was born is\nstill standing.) Timothy Fuller was elected a Congressman from\nMassachusetts in 1817 and served until 1825. He lavished upon his\neldest daughter a rigorous classical education usually reserved for\nboys. He taught her how to read at age three and a half, and she\nproved a child prodigy who rewarded Timothy’s attention. Her\nchildhood curriculum included Latin prose, poetry, and composition,\nsupplemented by Greek writings that included the New Testament as well\nas the classical philosophers, along with natural philosophy (natural\nscience) and the wide-ranging discipline then called moral philosophy,\nwhich subsumed what we call the social sciences. When she was nine,\nher father added The Spectator, Paradise Lost, and\nDr. Samuel Johnson to her reading list. Timothy’s stern manner\nand demanding requirements left young Margaret with emotional as well\nas scholarly legacies: she became obsessive and self-critical.  \nFormal schooling only began for Margaret in 1819; starting in 1824 she\nboarded at the School for Young Ladies in Groton for two years, then\nreturned home. There she resumed her study of the classics. She found\nthe Greeks more congenial than the Romans, identifying the Greeks with\nidealism, imagination, and freedom, the Romans with practicality,\nlogic, and stern composure. Her readings were supplemented now by the\nRomantic literature taking shape in Europe, which she found\nfascinating. By the time she was in her thirties, she could be\nregarded as the best-read person, male or female, in New England\n(Douglas 1977: 263). She ended up espousing an avowedly dual\nphilosophy that sought to embrace both classical and Romantic\noutlooks. She taught that the Platonic tradition celebrated masculine\nqualities while Romanticism celebrated feminine ones. Humanity as\nwhole needed both—and each individual person should cultivate\nboth their masculinity and their femininity. \nMeanwhile, however, Timothy Fuller’s political ambitions had not\nbeen realized and his law practice shrank to the point where he\ndecided in 1833 to move to Groton, Massachusetts, and operate (like\nmany other Americans of the time) a family farm. The farm had not yet\nbegun to turn a profit, however, when Margaret’s father died of\ncholera in October, 1835. Timothy had not drawn up a will, and by the\nmale-oriented law of the time, title to the farm passed to his\nbrothers, leaving his widow and children living on the farm dependent\non the charity of Margaret’s uncles. Margaret felt\nunderstandably bitter, and though only in her twenties was forced to\nassume responsibility for supporting her mother and young siblings.\nShe had begun work on a biography of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,\nhaving achieved fluency in German remarkably quickly, but gave up on\nit, and the European trip it would have entailed, so she could teach\nschool full time and earn a salary.  \nMargaret Fuller moved in highly literate circles, both before and\nafter her father’s death. In 1839 she made use of her social\ncontacts when she commenced a series of discussion groups for women\nthat lasted five years; she referred to them as\n“conversations”. Most of these were held in the home of\nher friend and fellow intellectual Elizabeth Palmer Peabody, who also\nfacilitated Fuller’s publishing some pieces. Another friend,\nRalph Waldo Emerson, invited Fuller to edit a journal called The\nDial, an enterprise she undertook in 1840. Fuller was supposed to\nreceive a salary of $200 annually, but the money was never\npaid—one of the reasons why she resigned after two years. She\ncontinued to write for The Dial after no longer editing\nit. \nIn 1844 Fuller moved to New York City and went to work for Horace\nGreeley’s famous newspaper, the New York Tribune, as a\nfull-time book reviewer. Where the Dial had a small and\ndeclining circulation, the Tribune had 50,000 subscribers.\nOver the next four years, Fuller wrote over 250 Tribune\narticles on literature, music, and art as well as social and political\nissues. She also published poetry during this period, though her\npoetry has never received much attention.  \nStarting in 1846, at her own initiative Fuller moved to Europe, first\nto England and then to the Italian peninsula (Italy was not yet a\nunited country), where she served as a foreign correspondent for\nGreeley. While still in England she met two Italians who would remain\nprominent in her life: Giuseppi Mazzini, Italian patriot and\nrepublican leader then in exile, and Giovanni Angelo Ossoli, whom she\neventually married, though it is unclear when or whether they\nparticipated in a wedding ceremony. If such a ceremony did occur, it\nwas after the birth of their baby boy, Angelo Eugene Philip Ossoli,\nnicknamed Angelino or Nino, on 5 September 1848 (Marshall 2013: 350).\n \nWhen a Roman Republic was proclaimed in February 1849, the Ossolis\nwere living in the democratic Republic and supporting its cause, led\nby Mazzini. The Republic sought to replace the Pope as temporal ruler\nof Rome, while continuing his spiritual function. The Pope did not\nacquiesce, and requested foreign aid to restore his power. France\nprovided it. In the war that followed, the Ossolis fought on behalf of\nthe Republic, he as a soldier and she as a nurse, but the French\nprevailed, and the Ossolis fled into exile in Florence.  \nIn 1850 the couple decided to move to the United States, where\nMargaret hoped to publish a book she had written on the short-lived\nRoman Republic, even though Giovanni spoke no English. The family set\nsail in May on a U.S. freighter named the Elizabeth, bound\nfor New York. During the voyage the captain died of smallpox, leaving\nthe first mate as acting captain. Under this inexperienced leadership,\nthe ship ran aground on a sandbar near Fire Island, NY, during a storm\nat 3:30 a.m. on 19 July 1850. Since they were less than 300 yards from\nshore, those who could swim jumped into the water—including the\nacting captain. The Ossoli family could not swim, and were left\nbehind. A crowd formed on shore, but no one tried to rescue the\nOssolis. After 10 hours, a giant wave washed Margaret and her family\nout to sea. Nino’s tiny body was eventually found ashore;\nneither of the adult Ossoli bodies ever was. The manuscript of\nMargaret’s book on the Roman Republic was among the items\nlost. \nCentral to both Margaret Fuller’s theory and practice of life\nwas the cultivation of the self. The practice of\n“self-improvement” or “self-culture” was very\nwidespread among middle-class white Americans of the time. Even\nworking-class men like Abraham Lincoln labored for self-improvement in\ntheir individual character and talents as a pathway to security and\nprosperity. Conscious development of one’s own integrity and\nabilities was regarded as a personal application of America’s\nproud white male democracy. The most admired and sophisticated\nexponent of self-culture was the famous clergyman of the recently\nemerged Unitarian religious denomination, William Ellery Channing\n(1780–1842). Channing pioneered a form of Christian humanism.\nFuller regarded him as a heroic exemplar of her own ideal of\nself-culture. Channing’s project included both genders and all\nraces of human beings (Fuller 1845: 60). \nMargaret Fuller was raised a Unitarian. The denomination originated in\nearly nineteenth-century New England in an intellectual rebellion by\ndescendants of the Puritans against Calvinist theology. The name\n“Unitarian” reflected their repudiation of the\nconventional Trinitarian Christian doctrine of a triune God of Father,\nSon, and Holy Spirit. The New England Unitarians ceased to regard\nJesus Christ as a unique divine personification of the Godhead.\nInstead, they emphasized the potential divinity in everyone: every\ngood person should seek to create their own Christlike, even Godlike,\ncharacter. As Channing explained in his sermon entitled\n“Likeness to God”: “God becomes a real being to us\nin proportion as his own nature is unfolded within us” (D. Howe\n1970: 120; citing Channing 1828, in Works, III, 229). \nMargaret Fuller’s personal quest for own self-realization as\nwell as her ardent feminist program for the self-realization of all\nwomen both took inspiration from Channing. Even though she abandoned\nthe Unitarian church and stopped attending any religious services,\nFuller never lost her admiration for Channing. Fuller set forth her\nmature religious principles in “A Credo” around June 1840\n(preserved in the Margaret Fuller Ossoli Collection, especially pp.\n97–98, in the Boston Public Library).  \nFuller, Channing and many other American intellectuals of their time\nbased their conception of self-improvement on the faculty psychology\nof the Scottish moral philosophers Thomas Reid, Lord Kames, and Dugald\nStewart. The word “faculty”, like the word\n“facility”, is derived from the Latin word for\n“power”, and faculty psychology throughout ancient,\nmedieval, and modern times has been the study of human powers. The\nconventional vision of human nature in Fuller’s day was\nhierarchical, with reason being rightly superior to the emotions.\nConscience was considered a rational power. Channing Unitarians\nendorsed metaphysical dualism and sought to subordinate matter to mind\nin the process of self-culture. A key issue for self-improvement was\nsubordinating “the passions” (including selfish, mercenary\nmotives) to reason, the divine quality in human nature. This version\nof Christian humanism took academic shape in the moral philosophy\ntaught at Harvard during Fuller’s lifetime (D. Howe 1988,\nespecially chap. 2, “The Moral Nature of Man”). Margaret\nFuller became the first woman granted library privileges at what was\nthen an all-male university. \n1835 was a year when the most influential persons in Margaret\nFuller’s life changed: her father Timothy died, and she made the\nacquaintance of Ralph Waldo Emerson, who became her friend and mentor.\nFuller’s relationship with Emerson, like that with her father,\nwas full of tensions. The two had very discordant personalities, as\nJudith Thurman has observed: “Waldo’s cool, cerebral, and\nironic; Margaret’s noisy, histrionic, and sincere”\n(Thurman 2013: 79). Though their interactions were often tempestuous,\nEmerson converted Fuller to his own version of self-improvement: the\nquest for spiritual self-transcendence. Followers became known as\ntranscendentalists because they sought to transcend the material world\nin communion with the divine. Fuller became a member of the\nTranscendental Club founded by Emerson and Frederick Henry Hedge,\nvirtually all of whose members were Unitarians or former Unitarians.\nThe transcendentalists (including Thoreau, Theodore Parker, and\nElizabeth Peabody) are remembered today for their contributions to\nAmerican literature, philosophy, and social reform, the first\nintellectual counter-culture in American history (see the entry on\n transcendentalism).\n At Emerson’s invitation, Fuller edited the transcendental\nperiodical The Dial for two years (1840–42) and\ncontinued to write for it afterwards.  \nThe transcendentalists aspired to rescue the United States from\ncultural provincialism. American culture was then chiefly based on\nCalvinism and on the Enlightenment; the transcendentalists wanted to\nintroduce their country to Romanticism and the philosophy of Kant.\nFuller was strongly attracted to German Romanticism. Hence her\nambition, never realized, to write a biography of Goethe. Of the\nancient philosophers to whom her father had introduced her,\nFuller’s favorite was Plato. \nThe American transcendentalists embraced Plato and Platonism in\ngeneral. They looked back fondly on the Platonists (more properly\ncalled Neoplatonists) of seventeenth-century Cambridge University in\nEngland. The Unitarian and transcendentalist intellectuals of\nnineteenth-century New England were aware of these Renaissance\nintellectuals and admired their reliance on individual freedom as the\nfoundation for religious faith rather than intolerant coercion. The\nCambridge Platonists rejected Calvinism and embraced a humanist form\nof Christianity focused on the proper development of human powers.\nThey not only found Plato’s own philosophy congenial, but also\nthat of the third-century Alexandrian Neoplatonist named Plotinus.\nPlotinus had developed a system for self-cultivation, seeking God\nwithin one’s own psyche. All of this heritage was\ninvoked in the nineteenth century by William Ellery Channing, Ralph\nWaldo Emerson, and Margaret Fuller. \nFuller was thoroughly conversant with Plato, but by no means his\nuncritical follower. In some of his writings, Plato was the first\nfeminist. Among the guardians of his ideal Republic a perfect\nmeritocracy prevails and women are included within the public spirit\nof the polis; they receive the same education as men and have\nequal opportunity to exercise political power. Elsewhere, however,\nPlato compromised with and even legitimated the prevailing subjugation\nof women. Fuller accordingly rendered a mixed verdict on Plato’s\nphilosophy of gender (Fuller 1845: 90; also see Okin 1979:\n15–70). Here, as always, she used tradition as a resource\nwithout letting herself be imprisoned by it.  \nWhere Channing and other Unitarian thinkers had been metaphysical\ndualists eager to impose the supremacy of mind over matter, Emerson\nand most transcendentalists espoused pure idealism. At least\ninitially, transcendentalism was itself a religion, and a religion\nthat rejected the relevance of empirical evidence like Scripture,\nmiracles, and the fulfillment of prophecies (see the entry on\n transcendentalism). \nMargaret Fuller retained the dualistic metaphysics of Channing rather\nthan the pure idealism of Emerson and her other transcendentalist\nfriends. But she followed the transcendentalist approach to the\ndistinction between “Reason” and\n“Understanding”. What we normally regard as perception and\nlogical thinking they classified as “Understanding”.\n“Reason” Fuller and others saw as divinely inspired\ninsight, peculiar to each individual and much more important for true\nreligion. “Understanding” carried us through the mundane,\npractical material world. “Reason” was the faculty through\nwhich a wise person conducted the Platonic Quest to go beyond the\nmaterial in search of the ideal. Both Channing and Emerson wanted to\nrecreate in the modern world the role that had been played by the New\nEngland Puritan minister as inspirational intellectual, spiritual, and\nmoral leader. Fuller was determined to open this role to women. Even\nwhile embracing nineteenth-century Romanticism, she sought to\nimplement the Enlightenment ideal of natural rights. In this and other\nways, she stands out to us as the most modern of the New England\ntranscendentalists.  \nMargaret Fuller’s “Conversations” in Boston became\nfamous among early American feminists. They commenced in 1839 and\ncontinued until April 1844. Each would last would last thirteen weeks\nin a pre-announced time and place (usually the parlor of her friend\nElizabeth Peabody). The “conversants” paid to\nparticipate—usually ten dollars for the series, about what\nEmerson and other transcendentalists charged for a set of their\nlectures. Most of the Conversations were for women only and had about\ntwenty-five participants. Fuller herself led off each two-hour weekly\nsession with a talk, which the audience were then encouraged to\ndiscuss and question. The women who attended were generally well-read,\nusually Unitarian in practice or background, often wives or relatives\nof male transcendentalists. Fuller conceived of her Conversations as\nessential supplements to the educational opportunities then available\nto middle- and upper-class New England women. These might include\nliterature, classics, and fine arts, simply decorative or recreational\nin purpose. Fuller would lead off with such subjects, but then use\nthem to press her participants to address serious questions about\nwomen’s lives, roles, and purposes. She was applying a\nconversational method she had learned from Plato’s dialogues and\nseen exemplified by her fellow transcendentalist and Plato disciple\nBronson Alcott. Her concern was not so much to teach as to provoke\nothers to think more deeply than usual (see Capper 1987).  \nAmong the many women who attended Fuller’s Conversations a\nnumber would go on to prominence in feminist and other reform causes,\nsuch as Lydia Maria Child, Elizabeth Peabody, Caroline Sturgis, Sophia\nRipley, Julia Ward Howe, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lydian Emerson (wife\nof Ralph Waldo Emerson), Ann Terry Phillips (wife of Wendell\nPhillips), Mary Peabody Mann (wife of Horace Mann), and Mary Channing\n(daughter of William Ellery Channing) (see Capper 2007: 110). \nIn these Conversations Fuller sought for a while to avoid discussing\nsocial reform causes other than feminism, such as antislavery, even\nthough some of her participants were already getting involved in them.\nThe British feminist Harriet Martineau, who visited America,\ncriticized her repeatedly for this policy. Eventually Fuller changed\nher mind about this. The Conversations, though she intended them to\nstimulate the thinking of others, also stimulated her own. \nIn July 1843, The Dial published as its lead article the\nfruits of Fuller’s new position, “The Great Lawsuit: Man\nversus Men, Woman versus Women”. Despite its\ntitle, the article was not framed as a lawsuit. It postulates that\nManhood (“Man”) and Womanhood\n(“Woman”) are transcendent ideals that individuals should\nstrive to realize, and that each ideal contains both masculine and\nfeminine qualities. There is no “wholly masculine man; no purely\nfeminine woman” (1843: 14; also in Fuller 1845: 103). But\nbecause men have greater access to the means of self-development, the\nideals of manhood have been more fully realized in practice than those\nof womanhood. This needs to be corrected for the benefit of all\nhumanity.  \nFuller embraces in this article both Romantic and Enlightenment ideals\nof democracy and scorns America’s cant about democracy while\nbetraying it in practice. “I need not speak of what has been\ndone towards the red man, the black man” (1843: 8; 1845: 14),\nshe comments in disgust. Now she views feminism as expressing a\nparallel objective with the abolition of slavery: both causes labor on\nbehalf of the individual seeking to realize personal potential (as do\nother reform causes like temperance and public education for children\nand the mentally retarded). Only after her move to Europe, however,\nwould her commitment to radical social change become complete. \nIn the meantime, Fuller’s embrace of the feminist cause was\nexplained more fully in the enlargement of her “Great\nLawsuit” article into her book, Woman in the Nineteenth\nCentury, the work for which she is chiefly remembered. She\ncompleted the book in November of 1844. Since the end of her\n“Conversations”, she had concluded that feminism was one\nof a number of worthy causes for human emancipation women should\nsupport. The book endorses freedom for Ireland and the return of Jews\nto Palestine, adding an emphatic warning against the annexation of\nTexas because that would strengthen the institution of slavery (Fuller\n1845: 90–91). \nModern readers will be surprised that Fuller’s book\ndoesn’t mention woman suffrage, which was not then a public\nissue—though of course it was clearly implied by her insistence\non equal rights for women, and Susan B. Anthony did acknowledge Fuller\nas a precursor of the women suffrage movement. Fuller usually\naddresses problems with popular culture rather than legal issues. She\ndoes stress the need for women to have a wider range of occupations\navailable.  \nYou ask me what offices they may fill; I reply—any. I do not\ncare what case you put; let them be sea-captains, if you will. (Often\nmisquoted as “let them be sea-captains, if they will”)\n \nA greater variety of occupations would help women to realize their\npotential, to “rouse their latent powers”, as she put it\n(Fuller 1845: 95). Most often, Fuller addresses the need to transform\nthe marriage relationship. Instead of the woman belonging to the man,\nmarriage should enable the two partners to ally and form a whole\ntogether. Ideally, marriage would be a “pilgrimage toward a\ncommon shrine” (Fuller 1845: 42). \nAt the end, her book cries out for an individual woman to be an\nexample to the world:  \nAnd will she not soon appear? The woman who shall vindicate their\nbirthright for all women; who shall teach them what to claim, and how\nto use what they obtain? (Fuller 1845: 97)  \nOnce she had gone to Europe, Margaret Fuller herself would undertake\nthis role. \nOne can find fault with Fuller’s book. It does not consistently\naddress its issue with logical development; it rambles, flowing from\none thought to another. She assumes her reader possesses her own wide\nrange of literary and classical learning, frequently making allusions\nthat few readers will actually recognize (especially nowadays).\nFuller’s book anticipated the first women’s rights\nconvention, which would occur in July 1848 at Seneca Falls in upstate\nNew York and demanded women’s suffrage, though even some\nfeminists of the time felt reluctant to endorse such a drastic\nmeasure. The book proved quite popular, not only in the U.S. but also\nin Britain, where it was pirated at a time before publishers were\nrequired to observe international copyright. Hers was the feminist\nbook of its time, analogous to Simone de Beauvoir’s The\nSecond Sex in the mid-twentieth century. \nIn 1844 Horace Greeley invited Margaret Fuller to move to New York and\ngo to work for his newspaper the New York Tribune as\nAmerica’s first fulltime literary critic. Greeley had published\n“The Great Lawsuit” in the Tribune and had\npersuaded Fuller to expand it into a book. His wife Mary had attended\nFuller’s “Conversations” and had prompted him to\nhire her (Capper 2007: 165). The Tribune provided Fuller with\na huge audience. Greeley and his paper belonged to the Whig political\nparty, which had formed in opposition to Andrew Jackson and criticized\nhis policies, including “Indian Removal” of tribes to west\nof the Mississippi. Fuller had travelled through Chicago and the\nMidwest earlier in the year and had become publicly critical of white\ntreatment of the Indians. She shared Greeley’s opposition to\nslavery and praised Frederick Douglass. Greeley’s\nTribune embraced many reform causes of the time. Fuller had\ncome to view women’s rights as part of a broad need for social\nreform, evident in her compassion for the women in prison whom she\nvisited. Most of them had been convicted of prostitution, though the\nmen involved were never prosecuted.  \nIn Congress, Timothy Fuller had strongly supported John Quincy\nAdams’s presidential campaign, opposed the Missouri Compromise, and\ndefended the rights of Native Americans.  His daughter and pupil\ninvoked the sixth President’s attitude toward the female sex in\nWoman in the Nineteenth Century (Fuller 1845: 77–78).\nWhen the Whig Party took shape in the 1830s, both Adams and Margaret\nFuller identified with it. Though women could not vote, Fuller saw the\nWhigs as her party of choice. “I attended last week”, she\nwrote to Emerson on 14 August 1837, “the Whig Caucus here”\n(meaning Providence, Rhode Island). “It is rather the best thing\nI have done” (Fuller, Letters, ed. Hudspeth 1983: I,\n295; for more on her Whig politics, see Letters, IV, 121).\nActually, the Whig Party was a bit more sympathetic to women’s\nrights than the Democratic Party, probably because the cause of women\nwas a predominantly middle-class movement prior to the Nineteenth\nAmendment, and the Whigs were a middle-class party. The Whigs were\nalso the party of both evangelical and Unitarian Protestantism, which\nin those days provided the principal base of support for many reform\nmovements, including antislavery, temperance, public schools, higher\neducation, international peace, prison reform (which promoted\n“penitentiaries” rather than simply punishment like\nflogging), the American Bible Society (which fostered literacy), and\nasylums for the insane, as well as women’s liberation. Though\nUnitarians did not share the theology of the evangelical\ndenominations, they often shared common social and political aims. \nIn 1846 Fuller went to Europe and become a foreign correspondent for\nthe New York Tribune, writing about European literature and\npublic opinion. European travel was expensive, and it was not clear\nthat Greeley was willing to reimburse Fuller’s costs\nsufficiently. Fortunately, a wealthy and politically enlightened\nQuaker couple, Marcus and Rebecca Spring, were friends of Fuller,\ndecided to spend some time in Europe, and offered to pay for some of\nher expenses if she would travel with them and tutor their young son\nEddie.  \nFuller began touring in England and Scotland with the Springs, sending\narticles back to Greeley’s Tribune. She met interesting\npeople there, including the elderly poet Wordsworth and Harriet\nMartineau, the English feminist who had earlier criticized her for\nshunning reforms other than feminism. Now that Fuller had embraced a\nmuch wider reform agenda, the two got along. London harbored an\nintellectual curiosity of the time, Thomas Carlyle, who rejected the\nCalvinist Christianity of his youth, celebrated German Romanticism,\nand knew many smart women, one of whom was his wife Jane. When Fuller\nand Carlyle met, mutual admiration ensued. But always with serious\nreservations. Carlyle’s politics were very different from\nFuller’s. He rejected democracy, endorsed antisemitism and white\nracism, and celebrated populist, nationalist historic leaders like\nOliver Cromwell and Frederick the Great. (Generations later some Nazis\nwould look back on Carlyle as a precursor.) Another Romantic whom\nFuller met in London would arouse her more uncritical admiration:\nGiuseppi Mazzini, the heroic Italian revolutionary. Mazzini embraced\nliberal democracy and personal fulfillment as aspects of his Italian\nrepublican nationalism. Fuller welcomed the chance to speak in an\nevent at a free elementary school for poor Italian expatriate boys,\nwhere she endorsed Mazzini’s revolutionary cause and invoked the\nprinciple of self-improvement through public education so popular with\nAmerican Unitarians and Whig reformers. Mazzini loved it. \nFuller went on to France, where she confirmed that Paris was indeed\nthe cultural capital of the world; she enjoyed the music and fine arts\nthere as well as the literature and philosophy she was accustomed to\nengaging. She contrived to meet the woman who had adopted the pen name\nGeorge Sand and become one the most popular and successful writers in\nall Europe, along with her current lover, Frederic Chopin. More\nsignificant politically was her relationship with Adam Mickiewicz, the\nexiled Polish Romantic poet-turned- revolutionary, striving to achieve\nPolish independence from Russia and Austria. Fuller had admired him\neven before they met in France. His social democracy appealed to her\nand so did his Romantic religious passion. It seemed like the two of\nthem might form a bond both sexually romantic and philosophically\nRomantic—but Mickiewicz was already married. Fuller moved on to\nthe Italian peninsula. \nMargaret Fuller’s time in Italy proved politically climactic.\nShe embraced simultaneously the Italian language, in which she became\nfluent, and the revolutionary struggle for Italian unity and\ndemocracy. Now back in touch with Giuseppe Mazzini on his home turf,\nshe eagerly supported his cause: transforming Rome into a democratic\nrepublic. When the new Pope Pius IX temporarily seemed supportive, she\napproved but (perceptively) remained cautious. When forced to choose,\nthe Pope disavowed Mazzini, and Fuller denounced the Pope. As\nrevolutionary movements spread around Europe in 1848, Fuller was\nconsistently enthusiastic. She kept her American audience informed\nabout the European revolutions, explaining that America should no\nlonger imagine itself to be the model Europe should imitate. She had\nbecome impatient with middle-class moderates and endorsed socialism.\nBy now she was even further to the Left than Mazzini. Meanwhile,\nFuller’s time in Italy was proving climactic personally as well\nas politically. She met the younger Giovanni Angelo Ossoli. Together\nthey had a child and their probable marriage is a point of discussion\nin the literature.  \nMargaret Fuller’s grand international political project was not\nrealized. The Roman revolution for which she and her husband fought\nproved a lost cause, and they had to flee to Florence. Her attempted\nreturn to the United States with her new family ended in disaster (as\nrelated above in Section 1 above). But Margaret Fuller’s\nultimate vision of a world where people are free and empowered,\nregardless of gender, race, or class, has remained a noble and\ninspiring vision.","contact.mail":"howe@history.ucla.edu","contact.domain":"history.ucla.edu"}]
