Grice received firsts in classical honours moderation (1933) and\nliterae humaniores (1935) from Corpus Christi College,\nOxford. After a year teaching in a public school, he returned to\nOxford where, with a nearly five year interruption for service in the\nRoyal Navy, he taught in various positions until 1967 when he moved to\nthe University of California-Berkeley. He taught there past his\nofficial 1979 retirement until his death in 1988. He was\nphilosophically active until his death—holding discussions at\nhis home, giving lectures and editing a collection of his work that\nwas posthumously published as Studies in the Way of Words. He\nis best known for his innovative work in philosophy of language, but\nalso made important contributions to metaphysics, ethics and to the\nstudy of Aristotle and Kant. His work has also been influential\noutside of philosophy in linguistics and artificial\nintelligence. Although relatively little work was published during his\nlife, he had a very wide influence via lectures and unpublished\nmanuscripts. The best known of these were the William James Lectures\nwhich he gave at Harvard in early 1967 and which circulated widely in\nunauthorized manuscript form until they were published as part of\nStudies in the Way of Words. He also played cricket, chess\nand piano, each at a very high level of accomplishment. A useful\nbiography including both Grice’s personal and professional life is\nChapman 2005; the review by Potts provides more perspective on some of\nthe points.\n\n\n\nThe best known of the works published during Grice’s lifetime\nwas his joint paper with Peter Strawson, “In Defense Of A\nDogma”, a widely reprinted defense of the analytic/synthetic\ndistinction against Quine’s attack in “Two Dogmas Of\nEmpiricism”. The best known of his ideas, that of a\nconversational implicature, first appeared in a 1961 paper “The\nCausal Theory Of Perception”, but was a focus of the James\nLectures. In contrast to the slogan, “meaning is use”,\noften associated (though perhaps inaccurately) with Wittgenstein,\nGrice distinguished those elements of language use which were due to\nmeaning from those which are due to other aspects. To illustrate, the\nsentence “He has not been convicted of a crime yet” means\nthat the person being referred to has not yet been convicted of a\ncrime. But in many contexts, the speaker would be taken to imply that\nthe person had committed at least one crime and was likely to be\nconvicted in the future. In “The Causal Theory of Perception,” Grice\ndeploys the distinction against J. L. Austin’s claim in Sense\nand Sensibilia that a sentence like ‘It looks to me as if I\nsee something red’ is only correctly used when someone (possibly\nthe speaker) has reason to doubt or deny that the speaker actually\nsees something red. Austin’s target is sense-datum theorists who\nattempt to introduce sense-data by appeal to such sentences. Grice\nargues convincingly that, while using the sentence may\ntypically imply the doubt-or-denial condition, that implication is not\npart of the meaning of the sentence since the speaker can\ncancel the implication by adding ‘I do not mean to imply that\nthere is any reason to doubt or deny that I see something red.’\nWhat the speaker means on such a occasion can be true even if the\nspeaker is using the sentence in an usual way, and there is no reason\nto doubt or deny the speaker sees something red.  \n\nThis distinction between meaning and use has found many applications\nin philosophy, linguistics and artificial intelligence. Both the\nanalytic/synthetic distinction, which relies on a conception of truth\nby virtue of meaning, and the idea of a conversational implicature\nrequire for their full philosophical development a theory of meaning.\nGrice provided the beginning of a theory of meaning starting with his\n1957 paper “Meaning” and elaborated in later papers (Grice\n1968, 1969, 1982). The basic idea was to distinguish two notions of\nmeaning: what a sentence means in general apart from any use of it,\nand what a specific speaker means by using the sentence on a\nparticular occasion. Grice sees the latter notion as entirely a matter\nof what the speaker intends. Grice’s idea was to show that the\nabstract notion of sentence meaning was to be understood in terms of\nwhat specific speakers intend on specific occasions.The following\nsections will outline the Grice-Strawson arguments for an\nanalytic-synthetic distinction (Section 2), notions of conversational\nimplicature (3), and then delve into his theories about meaning (4),\nreasoning (5), psychology (6), ontology (7), and value (8). \n\nGrice and Strawson begin their article with a dissection of the\nvarious ways one can reject a dichotomy and conclude that Quine’s\nrejection of the analytic/synthetic distinction is one of the more\nextreme cases: “He declares, or seems to declare, not merely\nthat the distinction is useless or inadequately clarified, but that it\nis altogether illusory, that the belief in its existence is a\nphilosophical mistake” (Grice & Strawson, 142). \n\nGrice and Strawson deploy a number of arguments against Quine’s\nposition, but the two main ones involve the distinction between an\nutterance meaning something and not meaning anything, and between the\nkind of revision of belief that merely recognize a previous belief as\nfalse and the kind which involves a change of concept, and hence a\nchange in the meaning of a word. These can both be illustrated with\ntheir pair of example sentences: \n\nThey claim that it is not difficult to understand what someone would\nmean by uttering (1), and it is fairly clear what it would take to\npersuade someone that (1) is not false, as seems initially\nevident. But in the case of (2), they argue, in effect, that with\nfurther investigation one would either conclude that the speaker was\nusing familiar words to express new concepts, or else would conclude\nthat nothing at all was being said. No attempt will be made here to\nadjudicate the dispute with Quine, who would reject both of these\ndichotomies (new concepts/old concepts, something said/nothing said)\nas well. But the reader should note that the crucial claims are that\nsomeone who asserts (2) is either asserting it with a meaning other\nthan the standard conventional one, or with no meaning at all. A\nfurther elaboration of their claims depends therefore on elucidating\nthe notion of the meaning of an utterance, and Section 4 will explore\nGrice’s account of this notion further. \n\nConversational implicatures are, roughly, things that a hearer can\nwork out from the way something was said rather\nthan what was said. People process conversational implicatures\nall of the time and are mostly unaware of it. For example, if someone\nasks “Could you close the door?” the hearer does not\nusually answer “Yes”, instead they perform the\nnon-linguistic act of closing the door. In this case, although the\nspeaker used a form of words that is conventionally a question, the\nhearer can infer that the speaker is making a request. \n\nGrice was the first to note this ubiquitous feature of language use\nand also the first to present a philosophical analysis. He begins by\nnoting that conversations are usually to some degree cooperative\nenterprises. He then formulates the Cooperative Principle: “Make\nyour conversational contribution such as is required, at the stage at\nwhich it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk\nexchange in which you are engaged” (1989, 26). \n\nAt a more detailed level, he distinguishes four categories with more\nspecific maxims. The category of Quantity includes two injunctions,\none to make your contribution as informative as is required, and the\nsecond to make it no more informative than is required. The category\nof Quality is governed by a supermaxim: “Try to make your\ncontribution one that is true”. The category of Relation has a\nsingle maxim, “Be relevant”, while the final category of\nManner has a short “super” maxim “Be\nperspicuous” which has various submaxims (1989, 27). \n\nPerhaps the first thing to note is that conversational maxims often\ncome into conflict. One party to the conversation may be caught between\nsaying something less informative than is desired (violating Quantity)\nand saying something for which there is insufficient evidence\n(violating Quality). One example of the application of these principles\ngiven by Grice is the following exchange: \n\nIn this situation the sentence B uttered does not logically imply that\nthe station is open. However, the remark is irrelevant unless the\nstation is open, so A can infer from the combination of Manner and\nQuality that B believes he has good evidence that the station is open.\nThus B’s utterance conversationally implicates that the station is\nopen. One characteristic of conversational implicatures is that they\ncan be cancelled. Thus if B adds to his remark above, “but I\ndon’t know whether it is open” then there is no conversational\nimplicature that the station is open. This contrasts with logical or\nsemantic implications which cannot be cancelled without\ncontradiction. \n\nThe most famous application of Grice’s ideas is to the debate about\nwhether the truth conditions of declarative conditional statements,\nsuch as “If George is driving, he will be late” are\naccurately captured by the material conditional. Representing the\nsample sentences as ‘George is driving \\(\\rightarrow\\) he will be\nlate’ would make the sentence true if it is false that George is\ndriving or true that he will be late (or both). Many writers argued\nthat it would be inappropriate for someone to make the assertion if\nthey knew that George was not driving. Grice’s response is that to\nargue that in most circumstances it is conversationally inappropriate\nto make that assertion because it violates conversational principles,\nnot because it is false. \n\nSymbolically, \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) should not be asserted in\ncircumstances where the speaker knows that \\(A\\) is false because\nthe statement not-\\(A\\) is true and simpler; similarly, if the\nspeakers knows \\(B\\) is true, \\(B\\) is a shorter simpler\nstatement; and if the speaker knows both of those facts, then\nnot-\\(A\\) and \\(B\\), is more informative. Thus the only\ncircumstances in which the conditional is appropriate is where the\nspeaker is ignorant of the truth values of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\),\nbut has some good reason to think that if \\(A\\) does prove to be\ntrue, \\(B\\) will as well. On this account, the truth conditions\nof the conditional are those of the material implication, but the\nappropriate assertibility of a conditional tracks the conditional\nprobability of \\(B\\) given \\(A\\). \n\nIt should be noted that while this explanation of the circumstances in\nwhich a conditional is asserted seems very plausible, the account does\nnot readily extend to apparent discrepancies between ordinary language\nconditionals and the material conditional when the conditional is\nembedded in a larger context, e.g., “Mary believes that if\nGeorge is driving, he will be late”. \n\nThis is true only if Mary believes that there is an explanatory\nconnection between George’s driving and his tardiness. Thus, it is\nfalse that the sentence is true if and only if Mary believes that\nGeorge is driving \\(\\rightarrow\\) he will be late. Suppose, for example, Mary\nbelieves that George will be late because he has set his watch\nincorrectly. She infers and believes that George is driving \\(\\rightarrow\\) he\nwill be late, but does not take any position on an explanatory\nconnection between driving and tardiness. \n\nIn the last two decades, there has been a burgeoning number of\nresearchers investigating conversational implicature and Grice’s\nprinciples. Criticisms have come from two opposing directions. Some\ncritics argue that Grice’s maxims are not sufficiently worked out to\nexplain many of the phenomena related to implicature. For example, in\nthe sentence, “Joan believes that some of her students will\nfail,” there seems to be an implicature that not all of her\nstudents will fail, even though the contained sentence is not\nasserted. In another direction, Wilson and Sperber, and separately\nBardzokas, argue that Grice’s principles can be derived from more\ngeneral principles and should be understood in the context of some\nversion of relevance theory. \n\nGrice contends sentence and word meaning can be analyzed in terms of\nwhat speakers (utterers, for Grice) mean. Utterers’ meaning, in turn,\ncan be analyzed without semantic remainder in terms of utterers having\ncertain intentions. To see the idea as initially outlined in Grice’s\n1957 article, “Meaning,” imagine you are stopped at night\nat an intersection, when the driver in an oncoming car flashes her\nlights. You reason as follows: “Why is she doing that? Oh, she\nmust intend me to believe that my lights are not on. If she has that\nintention, it must be that my lights are not on. So, they are\nnot.” To summarize: \n\nCall such an intention an M-intention. Grice’s idea is that an utterer\n\\(U\\) means that \\(p\\) by uttering \\(x\\) if and only if\n\\(U\\) M-intends that \\(p\\) by uttering\n\\(x\\). We will use ‘M-intends’ in this way in what follows.\nUtterances may include, not just sounds and marks but also gesture,\ngrunts, and groans—anything that can signal an\nM-intention. The example illustrates an indicative M-intention; such\nintentions may also be imperative. In such a case, the utterer intends\nto get the audience to perform an action. \n\nIn the case of sentence meaning, Grice’s idea is to explicate it in\nterms of M-intentions. He suggests that the claim that a sentence\n\\(x\\) means that \\(p\\) “might as a first shot be\nequated with some statement or disjunction of statements about what\n‘people’ (vague) intend (with qualifications about\n‘recognition’) to effect by \\(x\\)” (1957, 66).\nThe underlying idea is the same as in the flashing lights\nexample. When you utter, “She brandished her clarinet like a\ntomahawk,” I—as a Gricean audience—reason as\nfollows. “The standard use of that sentence is to utter it\nintending (1) that the audience believe she brandished her clarinet\nlike a tomahawk; (2) that the audience recognize the intention (1);\nand (3) that this recognition be part of the audience’s reason for\nbelieving that she brandished her clarinet like a tomahawk. This is a\nstandard, non-deceptive use; hence I should believe that she\nbrandished her clarinet like a tomahawk.” \n\nGrice’s post-1957 work on meaning divides along two lines.\nFirst, he refines the analyses of utterer’s meaning and sentence\nmeaning, primarily in the 1968 article, “Utterer’s Meaning,\nSentence Meaning, and Word Meaning,” and the 1969 article,\n“Utterer’s Meaning and Intentions.” Second, he\naddresses the fact that utterers and audiences rarely, if ever, reason\nin the way suggested. As you read these words, for example, you are not\nreasoning in that way. You read and you understand straightaway without\nany intervening reasoning. So how can Grice’s suggested\nexplanation be anything but illusory? These points will be considered\nin turn. \n\nIn “Utterer’s Meaning, Sentence Meaning, and Word\nMeaning,” Grice offers a revised version of his 1957 account of\nutterers meaning. Grice remarks that in \n\n(1968, 230). \n\nBy way of illustration, suppose \\(U\\), who wants the audience\n\\(A\\) to close the door, utters ‘Close the door.’\n\\(U\\) M-intends that \\(A\\) should intend to close the door,\nand note: we specify what \\(U\\) means using the subjunctive\nmood. \\(U\\) means that \\(A\\) should close the\ndoor. For the indicative case, suppose \\(U\\) utters ‘The\ndoor is closed,’ M-intending that \\(A\\) believe \\(U\\)\nbelieves the door is closed. We specify what \\(U\\) means using\nthe indicative mood—thus: \\(U\\) means that the door is\nclosed. \n\nGrice captures the role of moods in specifying meaning by introducing\na special notation. He represents the indicative case this way:\n\\(U\\) means that\n \\(\\vdash\\)(the door is closed);\n the imperative: \\(U\\) means that !(the door is closed). Here\n‘the door is closed’ represents a moodless, underlying\nsyntactical element Grice calls a sentence radical; it designates the\nmoodless proposition that the door is closed. Grice calls\n ‘\\(\\vdash\\)’\n and ‘!’ mood operators, and he explains them\ncontextually as follows: \n\nMore than two operators are required to handle the full range of\nthings utterers mean, but a complete list is not necessary to\nformulate the revised account of meaning. The account can be stated as\nfollows. Given a function from psychological states onto mood\noperators, if \\(\\psi\\) is a psychological state and \\(*_{\\psi}\\) the\nassociated mood operator, \\(U\\) means that \\(*_{\\psi}(p)\\) by uttering\n\\(x\\) if and only if, for some \\(A\\), \\(U\\) utters\n\\(x\\) M-intending \n\nNote, we have departed slightly from Grice’s notation; he uses\n‘\\(*\\)’ for the function that maps psychological\nstates into mood operators. Grice uses his revised treatment of\nutterer’s meaning to refine the very rough and preliminary\naccount of sentence meaning (structured utterance type meaning, in his\nterminology) he gave in “Meaning.” His account thereof uses\nthe notion of having a procedure in one’s repertoire. He\nsays, \n\nTurning to sentence meaning, the idea is that users of a natural\nlanguage like English have standard procedures for using sentences,\nand that—very roughly—a sentence means \\(p\\)\namong a group of utterers when and only when that group has the\nprocedure of using it to M-intend that \\(p\\). \n\nThis is a promising start. It is undeniable that English speakers have\nthe procedure of using ‘The door is closed’ to mean that\nthe door is closed. That is (one of the many) things we do with that\nsentence. So, assuming we accept the explication of utterer’s meaning\nin terms of M-intentions, it undeniable that English speakers have the\nprocedure of using that sentence to M-intend with regard to the\nproposition that the door is closed. This yields the explanatory\npayoff described earlier. We can see communication as a rational\nactivity in which an utterer intends to produce certain results and\naudiences reason their way to those results via their recognition of\nthe utterer’s intention to produce that very result. \n\nThis preliminary account must be complicated, however, as it is\nunacceptable on three grounds. First, there are infinitely many\nsentences. How does an utterer associate a procedure with each sentence\nof his language? If they must be acquired one by one, it will take\nan infinite amount of time. Second, sentences are structured\nutterance-types, where meaning of the whole is consequent (in ways\ndetermined by syntactic structure) on the meaning of the parts. The\naccount does not capture this aspect of sentence meaning at all. Third,\nthe account fails to represent the complexity introduced into the\naccount of utterer’s meaning; there is no mention of moods. \n\nThese considerations lead Grice to posit that the procedures\nassociated with sentences are resultant procedures arising recursively\nout of basic procedures associated with words. Grice explains that \n\n\n\nGrice introduces a canonical form for specifying resultant\nprocedures. He does so by generalizing the special notation he has\nalready used in specifying meaning. Recall that he represented the\nindicative case by: \\(U\\) means that \\(\\vdash\\)(the door is\nclosed);the imperative: \\(U\\) means that !(the door is closed). The\nindicative sentence ‘\\(\\vdash\\)(the door is closed)’ is\nassociated with the psychological state of belief: speakers can and do\nutter that sentence with the intention that audiences respond by\nbelieving the door is closed. The imperative ‘! (the door is\nclosed)’ is similarly associated with an audience response of\naction: speakers can and do utter that sentence with intention that\nthat audiences respond by closing the door. ‘\\(\\vdash\\)’\nand ‘!’ are examples of a type of syntactic item Grice\ncalls a mood operator. He assumes that the syntactic structure of\nsentences divides into a mood operator and the rest of the\nstructure. Grice uses ‘\\(*+\\mathrm{R}\\)’ to represent this\ndivision. Now let \\(\\mathrm{P}_{*+R}\\) be the set of propositions\nassociated with \\(*+\\mathrm{R}\\), and \\(\\psi\\) the psychological state\nor action associated with \\(*\\). Then a resultant procedure for\n\\(*+\\mathrm{R}\\) takes one of two forms. \\(U\\) has the resultant\nprocedure of: \n\nCall these type 1 and type 2 resultant procedures. As a definition of\nsentence meaning we can say that, where \\(p \\in\n\\mathrm{P}_{*+\\mathrm{R}}\\), \\(*+\\mathrm{R}\\) means \\(p\\) in a group\n\\(G\\) if and only if members of \\(G\\) have, with respect to\n\\(*+\\mathrm{R}\\), a type 1 or type 2 resultant procedure, the type\nbeing determined by the type of the mood operator\n\\(*\\). (Qualifications will, of course, be necessary to handle\n‘audienceless’ cases.) \n\nSo far, perhaps, so good. There are pleasant quibbles over details,\nbut in broad outline, the account is a very plausible description of\nmeaning. In fact, at least three authors, Bennett, Loar and Schiffer,\nhave developed their own more detailed accounts along Gricean lines.\nHowever, when we turn from description to explanation, plausibility\nappears to decline. The explanatory idea is to see communication as a\nrational activity where audiences reason their way to beliefs or\nintentions via their recognition of the utterer’s intention to\nproduce such results. What about the problem that utterers and\naudiences rarely if ever engage in such reasoning? Grice’s work\non reasoning contains the answer. Does this approach define sentence meaning in terms of speaker’s\nintentions without any semantic remainder? That depends on how one\ninterprets \nOne possibility is to explain at least some basic procedures in terms\nof the concept of reference, where reference is analyzed in terms of\nspeakers’ intentions. The basic procedure for\n‘tiger’ for example would be to utter ‘tiger’\nto refer to tigers. But there is another possibility: the knowledge in\n(a) and (b) includes the knowledge of the semantic properties of\nwords, and the semantic properties of combinations of word, where\nthose properties cannot be fully analyzed in terms of speakers’\nintentions. Grice never fully addressed in print the question of how\nbest to understand basic procedures.  \n\nIn Aspects of Reason, Grice begins by considering the\nsuggestion that reasoning consists in “the entertainment (and\noften acceptance) in thought or in speech of a set of initial ideas\n(propositions), together with a sequence of ideas each of which is\nderivable by an acceptable principle of inference from its\npredecessors in the set” (2001, 5). He shows that it is\nscarcely plausible to suppose that reasoning always involves the\nentertainment or acceptance of a sequence of ideas—the steps\nin the reasoning—each of which is derivable (or taken by the\nreasoner to be derivable) from its predecessors. \n\nHe points out that reasoning is often, indeed typically, enthymematic\nin the following way. Jill reasons: “Jack broke his crown, but\nhe is an Englishman; therefore, he will be brave.” She does not\nemploy any suppressed premise. She merely thinks:\n‘but he is an Englishman; therefore, he will be\nbrave’. The thought occurs to her in a way that carries\nconviction with it, and she thinks it intending the inference\nsignaled by ‘therefore’ to be valid. Grice suggests that\nit is a necessary condition of reasoning from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\)\nthat one intend that there be a formally valid (and\nnon-trivial) argument from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\). Grice devotes a\ngood deal of attention to the question of what to add to this\nnecessary condition in order to obtain a sufficient condition. He\nsuggests that the intention specified should play an appropriate\ncausal role in \\(X\\)’s coming to think \\(B\\). \n\nThere is an important corollary: when we articulate our reasoning\nexplicitly, we are typically not making previously suppressed premises\nexplicit; rather, we are constructing the steps as we supply them.\nSuppose, for example, we were to ask Jill, “Why do you think\nthat follows?” She could answer by saying she thinks that all\nthe English are brave; or that the English are brave when they break\ntheir crowns; or that people of Jack’s age and description are\nbrave provided that they are also English; and so on. In proposing one\nof these alternatives, Jill is not reporting her suppressed\npremise; she is advancing a premise she is willing to put forward now\nas what she would—or, perhaps, should—have thought or\nsaid then if the question of formal validity had been raised. \n\nReturning to meaning, why not view utterers and their audiences as\nsimilar to Jill? You say “Jack brandished his clarinet like a\ntomahawk,” and in response I straightaway believe the he did\nbrandish his clarinet in that way. Like Jill, I do not \nentertain—even in a suppressed way—any intervening premises. My\ncomprehension is immediate and automatic—unmediated by any\nreasoning at all. But this does not mean that we cannot see me as\nintending there to be a formally valid inference from your words to my\nbelief. Moreover, like Jill, I could construct the missing steps.\nThus: “The utterer has the resultant procedure of uttering\n”He brandished his clarinet like a tomahawk“ intending (1)\nthat the audience believe that the utter believes he brandished his\nclarinet like a tomahawk; (2) that the audience recognize that\nintention (1); and (3) that this recognition be part of the audience’s\nreason for believing that the utterer believes that he brandished his\nclarinet like a tomahawk. The utterer is following that procedure in a\nnon-deceptive way; hence I should believe, not only that the utterer\nbelieves that he brandished his clarinet like a tomahawk; but also, to\nthe extent that I have confidence in the utterer, I should believe\nthat myself.” \n\nSimilar remarks hold for you as the utterer of “Jack\nbrandished his clarinet like a tomahawk.” You reason: “I\nrecognize him as an English speaker; hence he knows I have the\nprocedure of uttering ”Jack brandished his clarinet like a\ntomahawk“ intending: (1) that my audience believe he brandished\nhis clarinet like a tomahawk; (2) that the audience recognize that\nintention (1); and (3) that this recognition be part of the\naudience’s reason for believing that I believe that he brandished\nhis clarinet like a tomahawk. He will believe that I am following that\nprocedure here in a non-deceptive way; hence he will believe that I\nbelieve that he brandished his clarinet like a tomahawk; and, to the\nextent that he has confidence in me, he will believe that\ntoo.” \n\nThere is no denying that we can describe utterers and audiences in\nthis way. But should we really embrace this description as an\nexplanation of meaning? To see the worry, imagine we are demigods. For\nour amusement, we create a race of creatures. We program language use\ninto their brains. We ensure, for example, that, when an utterer\nproduces the sounds “She brandished her clarinet like a\ntomahawk,” audiences believe that she did. To handle deceptive\ncontexts, figurative language use, language instruction situations,\ntelling jokes, and so on, we also build in heuristics that more or less\nreliably produce a different appropriate belief in such situations.\nWhen a creature utters a sentence and the audience forms the\nappropriate belief, the explanation is our programming, programming\nthat operates entirely at a physiological level that is entirely\ninaccessible to consciousness. So, even if an audience reasons to a\nbelief based on a recognition of relevant utterer’s intentions,\nsurely that reasoning is an epiphenomenon of limited explanatory\ninterest. The worry is that we may be like the creatures we have\nimagined. There is extensive physiological and psychological evidence\nthat our use of natural language is to be explained along the lines\nsimilar to the explanation in the case of our creatures. \n\nGrice’s ‘Meaning Revisited’ contains an answer to\nthis worry. The key idea is that the account of utterers meaning\nspecifies an optimal state that actual utterers rarely if\never realize. We explain this idea then return to our worry. Grice says\nthat, \n\nThough I think that in general we want to keep value notions out of\nour philosophical and scientific enquiries—and some would say\nout of everything else—we might consider what would happen if\nwe relaxed this prohibition to some extent. If we did, there is a\nwhole range of different kinds of value predicates or expressions\nwhich might be admitted in different types of case. To avoid having to\nchoose between them, I am just going to use as a predicate the word\n‘optimal’ the meaning of which could of course be more\nprecisely characterized later (1982, 237). \n\nThe analysis of utterers’ meaning illustrates what Grice has\nin mind. He suggests that, “[a]s a first approximation, what we\nmean by saying that a speaker, by something he says, on a particular\noccasion, means that \\(p\\), is that he is in the optimal state\nwith respect to communicating, or if you like, to communicating that\n\\(p\\)” (1982, 242). The optimal state is what the analysis\nof utterers’ meaning specifies. \n\nThe point is that there is no need to insist that real utterers\ntypically have all the intentions the analysis requires. We\nnonetheless, for purposes of psychological explanation, often regard\nthem to have the requisite intentions. For Grice, audiences do so when\nthey need to justify the actions and beliefs that result from\nutterances in their presence. For example, as a result of reading the\nlast sentence, you believe that we believe that audiences regard\nutterers as having the intentions specified in the account of\nutterers’ meaning when audiences are called upon to justify the\nbeliefs and actions they form in response to utterances. Why are you\njustified in believing this? Because you recognized that we uttered the\nsentence intending, by means of recognition of that very intention, to\nproduce that belief. Similar remarks hold for us as utterers. Why are\nwe justified in thinking that you will form a justified belief\nin response to our utterance? Because we know that you can supply the\njustification in terms of your knowledge of our intentions. \n\nThis pattern of justifications also yields an explanation. The\njustifications explain by showing that meaning and response are\ninstances of people’s capacity to act rationally. Such instances\ninclude actions one engaged in without prior reasoning, and which one\nwould have also engaged in if one had reasoned about whether to do so\nprior to acting. The appeal to such counterfactuals is explanatory to\nthe extent that speakers and audiences meet this condition: for a wide\nrange of cases of speaker meaning, speakers reliably make utterances\nand audiences reliably respond without reasoning in (more or less)\nways they would have if they had reasoned with sufficient time,\ninsight, and attention. Thus, the Gricean theory of meaning does\nexplain meaning as a rational activity. Grice’s treatment of\nconversational implicature also illustrates the breadth and power of\nthis approach. Our demi-god example ignored this connection between\nexplanation and justification. \n\nA further objection to Grice’s account of meaning is that young\nchildren understand the meaning of utterances but are not capable of\nprocessing the complexities apparently required by Gricean\ntheory. Thompson (2007, 2008) provides one approach to defend a\n(neo)Gricean account against these arguments. \n\nGrice’s treatment of conversational implicature illustrates the\nbreadth and power of this approach. Indeed, one of the motivations\nGrice had in giving an account of meaning was to distinguish between\nwhat is meant—M-intended—and what is not\nM-intended but implied. Grice’s conversational maxims are\nprinciples of rational communication that audiences use to construct\nan inferential bridge from what is meant to what is implied. \nThe continuing lively debates (e.g., Petrus 2010) about conversational\nimplicatures and meaning, which are present in linguistics and\nartificial intelligence as well as philosophy, are testimony to the\ncontinuing importance of Grice’s seminal ideas. \n\nGrice’s views on everyday psychological explanation are\nintertwined with his views on rationality. Grice contends that the\nright picture of rationality is the picture, given us by Plato and\nAristotle and others, as something which essentially functions to\nregulate, direct, and control pre-rational impulses, inclinations, and\ndispositions. Both everyday psychological explanation and assessments\nof rationality employ commonsense psychological principles. By such\nprinciples we mean a relatively stable body of generally-accepted\nprinciples, of which the following are examples: \n\nThese examples express relations among complexes consisting of\npsychological states and behavior, and, as such they serve a\ndescriptive and explanatory function. Other principles play a more\nevaluative role. Consider for example: \n\nConformity to this principle is a criterion of rationality. The\ndescriptive-explanatory and evaluative principles collectively give us\nis a specification of how “pre-rational, impulses, inclinations,\nand dispositions” operate as well as a basis for evaluating that\noperation. \n\nThe essential point for our purposes is that everyday psychology has\nspecial status for Grice. He argues: \n\nThus, while everyday psychology (or some preferred part of it) may\nnot entirely accurately specify how in fact we think and act, it does\nspecify how we ought to think and act. \n\nAssume everyday psychology is uniquely self-justifying in the way\nGrice suggests; then we must reject the suggestion that everyday\npsychology is just a rough and ready theory that we will (or could)\neventually abandon without loss in favor of a more accurate and\ncomplete scientific theory of behavior. Grice objects on this ground\nto theories that regard only scientific knowledge as truly descriptive\nand explanatory and that relegate commonsense psychological\nexplanation to a second-class role as a theory, useful in daily life,\nbut not a theory we should endorse as a description or explanation of\nreality. Grice remarks: \n\nThus, to return briefly to the theory of meaning, the picture that\ntheory offers of ourselves as rational communicators producing\njustified psychological attitudes in each other is no mere accident, no\nexplanatory way station to be abandoned as science progresses. It is an\nineliminable feature of the way in which we understand ourselves and\nothers. In addition to this result, Grice’s view of psychological\nexplanation also yield consequences both for ontology and for\nethics. \n\nGrice’s ontological views are liberal. As Grice says when\ncommenting on the mind—body problem in ‘Method in\nPhilosophical Psychology’, \n\nOur discussion of psychological explanation shows what Grice had in\nmind in his reference to entities that “come on the\nrecommendation of some form of transcendental argument, [and hence]\nmay qualify for the specially favoured status of entia\nrealissima.” Suppose—as Grice thinks—certain \nway of thinking, certain categories, are part of what\nis entrenched. Then there are certain concepts or categories that we\ncannot avoid applying to reality. \n\nThis theme will not be pursued further here; rather, we turn to the\nmore “Marxist” side of Grice’s ontology: the claim\nthat if entities work, they exist. We illustrate this point with the\nconcept of a proposition. The critical role of that notion in\nGrice’s theory of meaning motivates our focus on it. Quinean\ncriticisms of the notion have placed under it under a cloud of\nsuspicion, a cloud many see as hanging ominously over Grice’s\ntheory. \n\nOne of Quine’s arguments is that synonymy is not a well-defined\nequivalence relation, the identity conditions for propositions are\nunclear and there is ‘no entity without identity’. On this\nissue, Grice is not committed to an equivalence relation of synonymy\n(thus his remark above about indeterminacy), and he parts company with\nQuine over whether clear identity conditions are required. Grice, as\nnoted earlier, argues for such conditions. But the acceptability of\nhis theory of meaning does not depend on the success of that\ndefense. Within the theory of meaning, propositions are theoretical\nentities to be understood by the role in the theory, and that role,\naccording to Grice, does not demand a strict criterion of\nidentity. Rather: if they work they exist. It is worth noting in this\nregard that there are many respectable entities for which we do not\nhave criteria or identity. Suppose my favorite restaurant moves. Is\nit a new restaurant with the same name? Or suppose it changes owners\nand names but nothing else? Or that it changes menu entirely? Or that\nit changes chefs? It would be foolish to look for a single criterion\nto answer these questions—the answers go different ways in\ndifferent contexts. But surely the concept of a restaurant is a\nuseful one and restaurants do exists. Quine and Grice differ on the\ntheoretical usefulness of propositions. The main reason for\ndisagreement is due to Quine’s attitude that concepts such as belief\nand desire are of, at most, secondary importance in the unified\ncanonical science that is his standard for ontology. Grice, as we have\nalready noted, thinks that everyday psychological theory is of first\nimportance. \n\nGrice was constantly concerned with philosophical methodology, and the\ndiscussion so far omits one important methodological focus: ordinary\nlanguage philosophy. Although it was by no means Grice’s sole\nphilosophical commitment, it was a central one.\n \n\nGrice is a well-known critic of ordinary language philosophy,\nand one of his main targets was J. L. Austin and a style of reasoning\nhe popularized. Austin thought there was a relatively clear notion of\nwhat it is inappropriate to say, and that we could delineate\ntruth-conditions by identifying instances of inappropriateness\n(Warner, 2012). For example, he inferred from (1) “Typically, when one\nacts, it would be inappropriate to say either that one acted\nvoluntarily or that one acted involuntarily” to (2) “Typically, when\none acts, one acts neither voluntarily nor involuntarily.” As Grice\nconvincingly argues, the inference fails because being untrue is not\nthe only form of inappropriateness. Something may be true but\ninappropriate to say for other reasons (Grice 1960, 1975, 1981, 1989).\n \nGrice was, however, also a life-long practitioner of ordinary language\nphilosophy. He begins the “Prolegomena” to Studies in the Way of\nWords by noting that “some may regard [ordinary language\nphilosophy] as an outdated style of philosophy,” but he urges us “not\nto be too quick to write off such a style.” Instead, he urges us to\nbuild “a theory which will enable one to distinguish between the case\nin which an utterance is false or fails to be true, or more generally\nfails to correspond to the world in some favored way, and the case in\nwhich it is inappropriate for reasons of a different kind” (Grice\n1989, 4). Much of Studies in the Way of Words addresses this\ntask.\n \nWhy bother to build such a theory? There are many possible answers,\nand Grice would no doubt have given more than one, but we focus on\njust one answer, which is implicit in this work. Recall that, on his\nview, commonsense psychology consists, at least in part, of a body of\nself-justifying descriptive, explanatory, and evaluative\nprinciples. The principles are ‘self-justifying’ in the sense\nexplained earlier in section 6. An illuminating description of these\nprinciples would be an illuminating description of how we think, and\nsuch a description would certainly be of interest. How do we get one?\nBy carefully examining what we say. Two tenets of ordinary language\nphilosophy were that a clear view of what we mean in the\nlanguage we use is a clear view of what we think, and that a\nnecessary step in getting clear view of what we mean is close\nattention to the details of what we say. But the detailed\nexamination will only reveal what we mean if we can reliably\ndistinguish between “the case in which an utterance is\nfalse or fails to be true, or more generally fails to correspond to\nthe world in some favored way, and the case in which it is\ninappropriate for reasons of a different kind.”\n \n\nGrice uses this general account of reasoning to investigate moral\nreasoning and moral reasons. He emphasizes the connections between\nreasons, actions, and freedom. It is convenient to divide Grice’s\napproach into two stages (although he himself does not do so). The\nfirst stage argues that one must regard the exercise of rationality in\nthe free adoption and pursuit of ends as an unrelativized good at which\nall persons should aim. The second stage examines the concepts of\nhappiness and freedom to discover principles which\npersons—conceived of as rationally adopting and pursuing\nends—must adopt insofar as they are to qualify as rational. \n\nThe first stage. Why think that one must regard the\nexercise of rationality in the free adoption and pursuit of ends as an\nunrelativized good at which all persons should aim? To begin with, what\ndoes Grice mean by an “unrelativized good”? Grice grants\nthat the concept of unrelativized value requires defense; after all,\nthings have value only relative to ends and beneficiaries. So how is\nunrelativized value to be understood? Grice defines unrelativized value\n“in Aristotelian style [as] whatever would seem to possess such\nvalue in the eyes of a duly accredited judge; and a duly accredited\njudge might be identifiable as a good person operating in conditions of\nfreedom.” (Of course, this is still to talk about what is of\nvalue for and to persons; the point is to avoid relativization to this\nor that kind of person or kind of end.) So,\nwhy would a duly accredited judge see value in the free rational\nadoption and pursuit of ends, where such value is not ascribed\nbecause of the contribution that activity makes to some other\nend? \n\nGrice’s views on commonsense psychology provide the answer. As\nnoted earlier, Grice thinks that commonsense psychology exhibits two\nfeatures: parts of it are self-justifying; and, it contains principles\nfor evaluating thought and action, where some of those principles are\nself-justifying. When he turns to ethics, Grice adds that commonsense\npsychology represents us as exercising rationality in freely adopting\nand pursuing ends; moreover, this view of ourselves is self-justifying\nin the sense that we cannot coherently conceive of ourselves in any\nother way. Grice’s—very plausible—claim is that a\n“duly accredited judge” operating from within the theory of\ncommonsense psychology would take the rational, free adoption and\npursuit of ends as having unrelativized value. Hence, it does have such\nvalue. \n\nThe second stage: What principles must a free adopter and\npursuer of ends embrace in order to qualify as rational? Grice\naddresses this question most fully in Aspects of Reason and\nThe Conception of Value. The idea is that the combined\nrequirements of rationality (outside ethics), freedom, and happiness\nimpose substantive constraints on all persons. Grice develops this\ntheme with great insight and subtlety; however, he did not complete the\nproject, and the intricacies of his views are best left to the detail\nof his own works. \n\nThe sophistication and inventiveness of Grice’s work is\nwell-known. What is less well-known is its ambitious and systematic\nnature. Emphasizing this latter aspect has been one goal of this brief\npresentation of Grice’s work, work which weaves meaning,\nreasoning, psychology, ontology, and value into a complex, unified\nwhole.","contact.mail":"rgrandy@rice.edu","contact.domain":"rice.edu"},{"date.published":"2005-12-13","date.changed":"2017-10-09","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/grice/","author1":"Richard E.

Grice received firsts in classical honours moderation (1933) and\nliterae humaniores (1935) from Corpus Christi College,\nOxford. After a year teaching in a public school, he returned to\nOxford where, with a nearly five year interruption for service in the\nRoyal Navy, he taught in various positions until 1967 when he moved to\nthe University of California-Berkeley. He taught there past his\nofficial 1979 retirement until his death in 1988. He was\nphilosophically active until his death—holding discussions at\nhis home, giving lectures and editing a collection of his work that\nwas posthumously published as Studies in the Way of Words. He\nis best known for his innovative work in philosophy of language, but\nalso made important contributions to metaphysics, ethics and to the\nstudy of Aristotle and Kant. His work has also been influential\noutside of philosophy in linguistics and artificial\nintelligence. Although relatively little work was published during his\nlife, he had a very wide influence via lectures and unpublished\nmanuscripts. The best known of these were the William James Lectures\nwhich he gave at Harvard in early 1967 and which circulated widely in\nunauthorized manuscript form until they were published as part of\nStudies in the Way of Words. He also played cricket, chess\nand piano, each at a very high level of accomplishment. A useful\nbiography including both Grice’s personal and professional life is\nChapman 2005; the review by Potts provides more perspective on some of\nthe points.\n\n\n\nThe best known of the works published during Grice’s lifetime\nwas his joint paper with Peter Strawson, “In Defense Of A\nDogma”, a widely reprinted defense of the analytic/synthetic\ndistinction against Quine’s attack in “Two Dogmas Of\nEmpiricism”. The best known of his ideas, that of a\nconversational implicature, first appeared in a 1961 paper “The\nCausal Theory Of Perception”, but was a focus of the James\nLectures. In contrast to the slogan, “meaning is use”,\noften associated (though perhaps inaccurately) with Wittgenstein,\nGrice distinguished those elements of language use which were due to\nmeaning from those which are due to other aspects. To illustrate, the\nsentence “He has not been convicted of a crime yet” means\nthat the person being referred to has not yet been convicted of a\ncrime. But in many contexts, the speaker would be taken to imply that\nthe person had committed at least one crime and was likely to be\nconvicted in the future. In “The Causal Theory of Perception,” Grice\ndeploys the distinction against J. L. Austin’s claim in Sense\nand Sensibilia that a sentence like ‘It looks to me as if I\nsee something red’ is only correctly used when someone (possibly\nthe speaker) has reason to doubt or deny that the speaker actually\nsees something red. Austin’s target is sense-datum theorists who\nattempt to introduce sense-data by appeal to such sentences. Grice\nargues convincingly that, while using the sentence may\ntypically imply the doubt-or-denial condition, that implication is not\npart of the meaning of the sentence since the speaker can\ncancel the implication by adding ‘I do not mean to imply that\nthere is any reason to doubt or deny that I see something red.’\nWhat the speaker means on such a occasion can be true even if the\nspeaker is using the sentence in an usual way, and there is no reason\nto doubt or deny the speaker sees something red.  \n\nThis distinction between meaning and use has found many applications\nin philosophy, linguistics and artificial intelligence. Both the\nanalytic/synthetic distinction, which relies on a conception of truth\nby virtue of meaning, and the idea of a conversational implicature\nrequire for their full philosophical development a theory of meaning.\nGrice provided the beginning of a theory of meaning starting with his\n1957 paper “Meaning” and elaborated in later papers (Grice\n1968, 1969, 1982). The basic idea was to distinguish two notions of\nmeaning: what a sentence means in general apart from any use of it,\nand what a specific speaker means by using the sentence on a\nparticular occasion. Grice sees the latter notion as entirely a matter\nof what the speaker intends. Grice’s idea was to show that the\nabstract notion of sentence meaning was to be understood in terms of\nwhat specific speakers intend on specific occasions.The following\nsections will outline the Grice-Strawson arguments for an\nanalytic-synthetic distinction (Section 2), notions of conversational\nimplicature (3), and then delve into his theories about meaning (4),\nreasoning (5), psychology (6), ontology (7), and value (8). \n\nGrice and Strawson begin their article with a dissection of the\nvarious ways one can reject a dichotomy and conclude that Quine’s\nrejection of the analytic/synthetic distinction is one of the more\nextreme cases: “He declares, or seems to declare, not merely\nthat the distinction is useless or inadequately clarified, but that it\nis altogether illusory, that the belief in its existence is a\nphilosophical mistake” (Grice & Strawson, 142). \n\nGrice and Strawson deploy a number of arguments against Quine’s\nposition, but the two main ones involve the distinction between an\nutterance meaning something and not meaning anything, and between the\nkind of revision of belief that merely recognize a previous belief as\nfalse and the kind which involves a change of concept, and hence a\nchange in the meaning of a word. These can both be illustrated with\ntheir pair of example sentences: \n\nThey claim that it is not difficult to understand what someone would\nmean by uttering (1), and it is fairly clear what it would take to\npersuade someone that (1) is not false, as seems initially\nevident. But in the case of (2), they argue, in effect, that with\nfurther investigation one would either conclude that the speaker was\nusing familiar words to express new concepts, or else would conclude\nthat nothing at all was being said. No attempt will be made here to\nadjudicate the dispute with Quine, who would reject both of these\ndichotomies (new concepts/old concepts, something said/nothing said)\nas well. But the reader should note that the crucial claims are that\nsomeone who asserts (2) is either asserting it with a meaning other\nthan the standard conventional one, or with no meaning at all. A\nfurther elaboration of their claims depends therefore on elucidating\nthe notion of the meaning of an utterance, and Section 4 will explore\nGrice’s account of this notion further. \n\nConversational implicatures are, roughly, things that a hearer can\nwork out from the way something was said rather\nthan what was said. People process conversational implicatures\nall of the time and are mostly unaware of it. For example, if someone\nasks “Could you close the door?” the hearer does not\nusually answer “Yes”, instead they perform the\nnon-linguistic act of closing the door. In this case, although the\nspeaker used a form of words that is conventionally a question, the\nhearer can infer that the speaker is making a request. \n\nGrice was the first to note this ubiquitous feature of language use\nand also the first to present a philosophical analysis. He begins by\nnoting that conversations are usually to some degree cooperative\nenterprises. He then formulates the Cooperative Principle: “Make\nyour conversational contribution such as is required, at the stage at\nwhich it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk\nexchange in which you are engaged” (1989, 26). \n\nAt a more detailed level, he distinguishes four categories with more\nspecific maxims. The category of Quantity includes two injunctions,\none to make your contribution as informative as is required, and the\nsecond to make it no more informative than is required. The category\nof Quality is governed by a supermaxim: “Try to make your\ncontribution one that is true”. The category of Relation has a\nsingle maxim, “Be relevant”, while the final category of\nManner has a short “super” maxim “Be\nperspicuous” which has various submaxims (1989, 27). \n\nPerhaps the first thing to note is that conversational maxims often\ncome into conflict. One party to the conversation may be caught between\nsaying something less informative than is desired (violating Quantity)\nand saying something for which there is insufficient evidence\n(violating Quality). One example of the application of these principles\ngiven by Grice is the following exchange: \n\nIn this situation the sentence B uttered does not logically imply that\nthe station is open. However, the remark is irrelevant unless the\nstation is open, so A can infer from the combination of Manner and\nQuality that B believes he has good evidence that the station is open.\nThus B’s utterance conversationally implicates that the station is\nopen. One characteristic of conversational implicatures is that they\ncan be cancelled. Thus if B adds to his remark above, “but I\ndon’t know whether it is open” then there is no conversational\nimplicature that the station is open. This contrasts with logical or\nsemantic implications which cannot be cancelled without\ncontradiction. \n\nThe most famous application of Grice’s ideas is to the debate about\nwhether the truth conditions of declarative conditional statements,\nsuch as “If George is driving, he will be late” are\naccurately captured by the material conditional. Representing the\nsample sentences as ‘George is driving \\(\\rightarrow\\) he will be\nlate’ would make the sentence true if it is false that George is\ndriving or true that he will be late (or both). Many writers argued\nthat it would be inappropriate for someone to make the assertion if\nthey knew that George was not driving. Grice’s response is that to\nargue that in most circumstances it is conversationally inappropriate\nto make that assertion because it violates conversational principles,\nnot because it is false. \n\nSymbolically, \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) should not be asserted in\ncircumstances where the speaker knows that \\(A\\) is false because\nthe statement not-\\(A\\) is true and simpler; similarly, if the\nspeakers knows \\(B\\) is true, \\(B\\) is a shorter simpler\nstatement; and if the speaker knows both of those facts, then\nnot-\\(A\\) and \\(B\\), is more informative. Thus the only\ncircumstances in which the conditional is appropriate is where the\nspeaker is ignorant of the truth values of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\),\nbut has some good reason to think that if \\(A\\) does prove to be\ntrue, \\(B\\) will as well. On this account, the truth conditions\nof the conditional are those of the material implication, but the\nappropriate assertibility of a conditional tracks the conditional\nprobability of \\(B\\) given \\(A\\). \n\nIt should be noted that while this explanation of the circumstances in\nwhich a conditional is asserted seems very plausible, the account does\nnot readily extend to apparent discrepancies between ordinary language\nconditionals and the material conditional when the conditional is\nembedded in a larger context, e.g., “Mary believes that if\nGeorge is driving, he will be late”. \n\nThis is true only if Mary believes that there is an explanatory\nconnection between George’s driving and his tardiness. Thus, it is\nfalse that the sentence is true if and only if Mary believes that\nGeorge is driving \\(\\rightarrow\\) he will be late. Suppose, for example, Mary\nbelieves that George will be late because he has set his watch\nincorrectly. She infers and believes that George is driving \\(\\rightarrow\\) he\nwill be late, but does not take any position on an explanatory\nconnection between driving and tardiness. \n\nIn the last two decades, there has been a burgeoning number of\nresearchers investigating conversational implicature and Grice’s\nprinciples. Criticisms have come from two opposing directions. Some\ncritics argue that Grice’s maxims are not sufficiently worked out to\nexplain many of the phenomena related to implicature. For example, in\nthe sentence, “Joan believes that some of her students will\nfail,” there seems to be an implicature that not all of her\nstudents will fail, even though the contained sentence is not\nasserted. In another direction, Wilson and Sperber, and separately\nBardzokas, argue that Grice’s principles can be derived from more\ngeneral principles and should be understood in the context of some\nversion of relevance theory. \n\nGrice contends sentence and word meaning can be analyzed in terms of\nwhat speakers (utterers, for Grice) mean. Utterers’ meaning, in turn,\ncan be analyzed without semantic remainder in terms of utterers having\ncertain intentions. To see the idea as initially outlined in Grice’s\n1957 article, “Meaning,” imagine you are stopped at night\nat an intersection, when the driver in an oncoming car flashes her\nlights. You reason as follows: “Why is she doing that? Oh, she\nmust intend me to believe that my lights are not on. If she has that\nintention, it must be that my lights are not on. So, they are\nnot.” To summarize: \n\nCall such an intention an M-intention. Grice’s idea is that an utterer\n\\(U\\) means that \\(p\\) by uttering \\(x\\) if and only if\n\\(U\\) M-intends that \\(p\\) by uttering\n\\(x\\). We will use ‘M-intends’ in this way in what follows.\nUtterances may include, not just sounds and marks but also gesture,\ngrunts, and groans—anything that can signal an\nM-intention. The example illustrates an indicative M-intention; such\nintentions may also be imperative. In such a case, the utterer intends\nto get the audience to perform an action. \n\nIn the case of sentence meaning, Grice’s idea is to explicate it in\nterms of M-intentions. He suggests that the claim that a sentence\n\\(x\\) means that \\(p\\) “might as a first shot be\nequated with some statement or disjunction of statements about what\n‘people’ (vague) intend (with qualifications about\n‘recognition’) to effect by \\(x\\)” (1957, 66).\nThe underlying idea is the same as in the flashing lights\nexample. When you utter, “She brandished her clarinet like a\ntomahawk,” I—as a Gricean audience—reason as\nfollows. “The standard use of that sentence is to utter it\nintending (1) that the audience believe she brandished her clarinet\nlike a tomahawk; (2) that the audience recognize the intention (1);\nand (3) that this recognition be part of the audience’s reason for\nbelieving that she brandished her clarinet like a tomahawk. This is a\nstandard, non-deceptive use; hence I should believe that she\nbrandished her clarinet like a tomahawk.” \n\nGrice’s post-1957 work on meaning divides along two lines.\nFirst, he refines the analyses of utterer’s meaning and sentence\nmeaning, primarily in the 1968 article, “Utterer’s Meaning,\nSentence Meaning, and Word Meaning,” and the 1969 article,\n“Utterer’s Meaning and Intentions.” Second, he\naddresses the fact that utterers and audiences rarely, if ever, reason\nin the way suggested. As you read these words, for example, you are not\nreasoning in that way. You read and you understand straightaway without\nany intervening reasoning. So how can Grice’s suggested\nexplanation be anything but illusory? These points will be considered\nin turn. \n\nIn “Utterer’s Meaning, Sentence Meaning, and Word\nMeaning,” Grice offers a revised version of his 1957 account of\nutterers meaning. Grice remarks that in \n\n(1968, 230). \n\nBy way of illustration, suppose \\(U\\), who wants the audience\n\\(A\\) to close the door, utters ‘Close the door.’\n\\(U\\) M-intends that \\(A\\) should intend to close the door,\nand note: we specify what \\(U\\) means using the subjunctive\nmood. \\(U\\) means that \\(A\\) should close the\ndoor. For the indicative case, suppose \\(U\\) utters ‘The\ndoor is closed,’ M-intending that \\(A\\) believe \\(U\\)\nbelieves the door is closed. We specify what \\(U\\) means using\nthe indicative mood—thus: \\(U\\) means that the door is\nclosed. \n\nGrice captures the role of moods in specifying meaning by introducing\na special notation. He represents the indicative case this way:\n\\(U\\) means that\n \\(\\vdash\\)(the door is closed);\n the imperative: \\(U\\) means that !(the door is closed). Here\n‘the door is closed’ represents a moodless, underlying\nsyntactical element Grice calls a sentence radical; it designates the\nmoodless proposition that the door is closed. Grice calls\n ‘\\(\\vdash\\)’\n and ‘!’ mood operators, and he explains them\ncontextually as follows: \n\nMore than two operators are required to handle the full range of\nthings utterers mean, but a complete list is not necessary to\nformulate the revised account of meaning. The account can be stated as\nfollows. Given a function from psychological states onto mood\noperators, if \\(\\psi\\) is a psychological state and \\(*_{\\psi}\\) the\nassociated mood operator, \\(U\\) means that \\(*_{\\psi}(p)\\) by uttering\n\\(x\\) if and only if, for some \\(A\\), \\(U\\) utters\n\\(x\\) M-intending \n\nNote, we have departed slightly from Grice’s notation; he uses\n‘\\(*\\)’ for the function that maps psychological\nstates into mood operators. Grice uses his revised treatment of\nutterer’s meaning to refine the very rough and preliminary\naccount of sentence meaning (structured utterance type meaning, in his\nterminology) he gave in “Meaning.” His account thereof uses\nthe notion of having a procedure in one’s repertoire. He\nsays, \n\nTurning to sentence meaning, the idea is that users of a natural\nlanguage like English have standard procedures for using sentences,\nand that—very roughly—a sentence means \\(p\\)\namong a group of utterers when and only when that group has the\nprocedure of using it to M-intend that \\(p\\). \n\nThis is a promising start. It is undeniable that English speakers have\nthe procedure of using ‘The door is closed’ to mean that\nthe door is closed. That is (one of the many) things we do with that\nsentence. So, assuming we accept the explication of utterer’s meaning\nin terms of M-intentions, it undeniable that English speakers have the\nprocedure of using that sentence to M-intend with regard to the\nproposition that the door is closed. This yields the explanatory\npayoff described earlier. We can see communication as a rational\nactivity in which an utterer intends to produce certain results and\naudiences reason their way to those results via their recognition of\nthe utterer’s intention to produce that very result. \n\nThis preliminary account must be complicated, however, as it is\nunacceptable on three grounds. First, there are infinitely many\nsentences. How does an utterer associate a procedure with each sentence\nof his language? If they must be acquired one by one, it will take\nan infinite amount of time. Second, sentences are structured\nutterance-types, where meaning of the whole is consequent (in ways\ndetermined by syntactic structure) on the meaning of the parts. The\naccount does not capture this aspect of sentence meaning at all. Third,\nthe account fails to represent the complexity introduced into the\naccount of utterer’s meaning; there is no mention of moods. \n\nThese considerations lead Grice to posit that the procedures\nassociated with sentences are resultant procedures arising recursively\nout of basic procedures associated with words. Grice explains that \n\n\n\nGrice introduces a canonical form for specifying resultant\nprocedures. He does so by generalizing the special notation he has\nalready used in specifying meaning. Recall that he represented the\nindicative case by: \\(U\\) means that \\(\\vdash\\)(the door is\nclosed);the imperative: \\(U\\) means that !(the door is closed). The\nindicative sentence ‘\\(\\vdash\\)(the door is closed)’ is\nassociated with the psychological state of belief: speakers can and do\nutter that sentence with the intention that audiences respond by\nbelieving the door is closed. The imperative ‘! (the door is\nclosed)’ is similarly associated with an audience response of\naction: speakers can and do utter that sentence with intention that\nthat audiences respond by closing the door. ‘\\(\\vdash\\)’\nand ‘!’ are examples of a type of syntactic item Grice\ncalls a mood operator. He assumes that the syntactic structure of\nsentences divides into a mood operator and the rest of the\nstructure. Grice uses ‘\\(*+\\mathrm{R}\\)’ to represent this\ndivision. Now let \\(\\mathrm{P}_{*+R}\\) be the set of propositions\nassociated with \\(*+\\mathrm{R}\\), and \\(\\psi\\) the psychological state\nor action associated with \\(*\\). Then a resultant procedure for\n\\(*+\\mathrm{R}\\) takes one of two forms. \\(U\\) has the resultant\nprocedure of: \n\nCall these type 1 and type 2 resultant procedures. As a definition of\nsentence meaning we can say that, where \\(p \\in\n\\mathrm{P}_{*+\\mathrm{R}}\\), \\(*+\\mathrm{R}\\) means \\(p\\) in a group\n\\(G\\) if and only if members of \\(G\\) have, with respect to\n\\(*+\\mathrm{R}\\), a type 1 or type 2 resultant procedure, the type\nbeing determined by the type of the mood operator\n\\(*\\). (Qualifications will, of course, be necessary to handle\n‘audienceless’ cases.) \n\nSo far, perhaps, so good. There are pleasant quibbles over details,\nbut in broad outline, the account is a very plausible description of\nmeaning. In fact, at least three authors, Bennett, Loar and Schiffer,\nhave developed their own more detailed accounts along Gricean lines.\nHowever, when we turn from description to explanation, plausibility\nappears to decline. The explanatory idea is to see communication as a\nrational activity where audiences reason their way to beliefs or\nintentions via their recognition of the utterer’s intention to\nproduce such results. What about the problem that utterers and\naudiences rarely if ever engage in such reasoning? Grice’s work\non reasoning contains the answer. Does this approach define sentence meaning in terms of speaker’s\nintentions without any semantic remainder? That depends on how one\ninterprets \nOne possibility is to explain at least some basic procedures in terms\nof the concept of reference, where reference is analyzed in terms of\nspeakers’ intentions. The basic procedure for\n‘tiger’ for example would be to utter ‘tiger’\nto refer to tigers. But there is another possibility: the knowledge in\n(a) and (b) includes the knowledge of the semantic properties of\nwords, and the semantic properties of combinations of word, where\nthose properties cannot be fully analyzed in terms of speakers’\nintentions. Grice never fully addressed in print the question of how\nbest to understand basic procedures.  \n\nIn Aspects of Reason, Grice begins by considering the\nsuggestion that reasoning consists in “the entertainment (and\noften acceptance) in thought or in speech of a set of initial ideas\n(propositions), together with a sequence of ideas each of which is\nderivable by an acceptable principle of inference from its\npredecessors in the set” (2001, 5). He shows that it is\nscarcely plausible to suppose that reasoning always involves the\nentertainment or acceptance of a sequence of ideas—the steps\nin the reasoning—each of which is derivable (or taken by the\nreasoner to be derivable) from its predecessors. \n\nHe points out that reasoning is often, indeed typically, enthymematic\nin the following way. Jill reasons: “Jack broke his crown, but\nhe is an Englishman; therefore, he will be brave.” She does not\nemploy any suppressed premise. She merely thinks:\n‘but he is an Englishman; therefore, he will be\nbrave’. The thought occurs to her in a way that carries\nconviction with it, and she thinks it intending the inference\nsignaled by ‘therefore’ to be valid. Grice suggests that\nit is a necessary condition of reasoning from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\)\nthat one intend that there be a formally valid (and\nnon-trivial) argument from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\). Grice devotes a\ngood deal of attention to the question of what to add to this\nnecessary condition in order to obtain a sufficient condition. He\nsuggests that the intention specified should play an appropriate\ncausal role in \\(X\\)’s coming to think \\(B\\). \n\nThere is an important corollary: when we articulate our reasoning\nexplicitly, we are typically not making previously suppressed premises\nexplicit; rather, we are constructing the steps as we supply them.\nSuppose, for example, we were to ask Jill, “Why do you think\nthat follows?” She could answer by saying she thinks that all\nthe English are brave; or that the English are brave when they break\ntheir crowns; or that people of Jack’s age and description are\nbrave provided that they are also English; and so on. In proposing one\nof these alternatives, Jill is not reporting her suppressed\npremise; she is advancing a premise she is willing to put forward now\nas what she would—or, perhaps, should—have thought or\nsaid then if the question of formal validity had been raised. \n\nReturning to meaning, why not view utterers and their audiences as\nsimilar to Jill? You say “Jack brandished his clarinet like a\ntomahawk,” and in response I straightaway believe the he did\nbrandish his clarinet in that way. Like Jill, I do not \nentertain—even in a suppressed way—any intervening premises. My\ncomprehension is immediate and automatic—unmediated by any\nreasoning at all. But this does not mean that we cannot see me as\nintending there to be a formally valid inference from your words to my\nbelief. Moreover, like Jill, I could construct the missing steps.\nThus: “The utterer has the resultant procedure of uttering\n”He brandished his clarinet like a tomahawk“ intending (1)\nthat the audience believe that the utter believes he brandished his\nclarinet like a tomahawk; (2) that the audience recognize that\nintention (1); and (3) that this recognition be part of the audience’s\nreason for believing that the utterer believes that he brandished his\nclarinet like a tomahawk. The utterer is following that procedure in a\nnon-deceptive way; hence I should believe, not only that the utterer\nbelieves that he brandished his clarinet like a tomahawk; but also, to\nthe extent that I have confidence in the utterer, I should believe\nthat myself.” \n\nSimilar remarks hold for you as the utterer of “Jack\nbrandished his clarinet like a tomahawk.” You reason: “I\nrecognize him as an English speaker; hence he knows I have the\nprocedure of uttering ”Jack brandished his clarinet like a\ntomahawk“ intending: (1) that my audience believe he brandished\nhis clarinet like a tomahawk; (2) that the audience recognize that\nintention (1); and (3) that this recognition be part of the\naudience’s reason for believing that I believe that he brandished\nhis clarinet like a tomahawk. He will believe that I am following that\nprocedure here in a non-deceptive way; hence he will believe that I\nbelieve that he brandished his clarinet like a tomahawk; and, to the\nextent that he has confidence in me, he will believe that\ntoo.” \n\nThere is no denying that we can describe utterers and audiences in\nthis way. But should we really embrace this description as an\nexplanation of meaning? To see the worry, imagine we are demigods. For\nour amusement, we create a race of creatures. We program language use\ninto their brains. We ensure, for example, that, when an utterer\nproduces the sounds “She brandished her clarinet like a\ntomahawk,” audiences believe that she did. To handle deceptive\ncontexts, figurative language use, language instruction situations,\ntelling jokes, and so on, we also build in heuristics that more or less\nreliably produce a different appropriate belief in such situations.\nWhen a creature utters a sentence and the audience forms the\nappropriate belief, the explanation is our programming, programming\nthat operates entirely at a physiological level that is entirely\ninaccessible to consciousness. So, even if an audience reasons to a\nbelief based on a recognition of relevant utterer’s intentions,\nsurely that reasoning is an epiphenomenon of limited explanatory\ninterest. The worry is that we may be like the creatures we have\nimagined. There is extensive physiological and psychological evidence\nthat our use of natural language is to be explained along the lines\nsimilar to the explanation in the case of our creatures. \n\nGrice’s ‘Meaning Revisited’ contains an answer to\nthis worry. The key idea is that the account of utterers meaning\nspecifies an optimal state that actual utterers rarely if\never realize. We explain this idea then return to our worry. Grice says\nthat, \n\nThough I think that in general we want to keep value notions out of\nour philosophical and scientific enquiries—and some would say\nout of everything else—we might consider what would happen if\nwe relaxed this prohibition to some extent. If we did, there is a\nwhole range of different kinds of value predicates or expressions\nwhich might be admitted in different types of case. To avoid having to\nchoose between them, I am just going to use as a predicate the word\n‘optimal’ the meaning of which could of course be more\nprecisely characterized later (1982, 237). \n\nThe analysis of utterers’ meaning illustrates what Grice has\nin mind. He suggests that, “[a]s a first approximation, what we\nmean by saying that a speaker, by something he says, on a particular\noccasion, means that \\(p\\), is that he is in the optimal state\nwith respect to communicating, or if you like, to communicating that\n\\(p\\)” (1982, 242). The optimal state is what the analysis\nof utterers’ meaning specifies. \n\nThe point is that there is no need to insist that real utterers\ntypically have all the intentions the analysis requires. We\nnonetheless, for purposes of psychological explanation, often regard\nthem to have the requisite intentions. For Grice, audiences do so when\nthey need to justify the actions and beliefs that result from\nutterances in their presence. For example, as a result of reading the\nlast sentence, you believe that we believe that audiences regard\nutterers as having the intentions specified in the account of\nutterers’ meaning when audiences are called upon to justify the\nbeliefs and actions they form in response to utterances. Why are you\njustified in believing this? Because you recognized that we uttered the\nsentence intending, by means of recognition of that very intention, to\nproduce that belief. Similar remarks hold for us as utterers. Why are\nwe justified in thinking that you will form a justified belief\nin response to our utterance? Because we know that you can supply the\njustification in terms of your knowledge of our intentions. \n\nThis pattern of justifications also yields an explanation. The\njustifications explain by showing that meaning and response are\ninstances of people’s capacity to act rationally. Such instances\ninclude actions one engaged in without prior reasoning, and which one\nwould have also engaged in if one had reasoned about whether to do so\nprior to acting. The appeal to such counterfactuals is explanatory to\nthe extent that speakers and audiences meet this condition: for a wide\nrange of cases of speaker meaning, speakers reliably make utterances\nand audiences reliably respond without reasoning in (more or less)\nways they would have if they had reasoned with sufficient time,\ninsight, and attention. Thus, the Gricean theory of meaning does\nexplain meaning as a rational activity. Grice’s treatment of\nconversational implicature also illustrates the breadth and power of\nthis approach. Our demi-god example ignored this connection between\nexplanation and justification. \n\nA further objection to Grice’s account of meaning is that young\nchildren understand the meaning of utterances but are not capable of\nprocessing the complexities apparently required by Gricean\ntheory. Thompson (2007, 2008) provides one approach to defend a\n(neo)Gricean account against these arguments. \n\nGrice’s treatment of conversational implicature illustrates the\nbreadth and power of this approach. Indeed, one of the motivations\nGrice had in giving an account of meaning was to distinguish between\nwhat is meant—M-intended—and what is not\nM-intended but implied. Grice’s conversational maxims are\nprinciples of rational communication that audiences use to construct\nan inferential bridge from what is meant to what is implied. \nThe continuing lively debates (e.g., Petrus 2010) about conversational\nimplicatures and meaning, which are present in linguistics and\nartificial intelligence as well as philosophy, are testimony to the\ncontinuing importance of Grice’s seminal ideas. \n\nGrice’s views on everyday psychological explanation are\nintertwined with his views on rationality. Grice contends that the\nright picture of rationality is the picture, given us by Plato and\nAristotle and others, as something which essentially functions to\nregulate, direct, and control pre-rational impulses, inclinations, and\ndispositions. Both everyday psychological explanation and assessments\nof rationality employ commonsense psychological principles. By such\nprinciples we mean a relatively stable body of generally-accepted\nprinciples, of which the following are examples: \n\nThese examples express relations among complexes consisting of\npsychological states and behavior, and, as such they serve a\ndescriptive and explanatory function. Other principles play a more\nevaluative role. Consider for example: \n\nConformity to this principle is a criterion of rationality. The\ndescriptive-explanatory and evaluative principles collectively give us\nis a specification of how “pre-rational, impulses, inclinations,\nand dispositions” operate as well as a basis for evaluating that\noperation. \n\nThe essential point for our purposes is that everyday psychology has\nspecial status for Grice. He argues: \n\nThus, while everyday psychology (or some preferred part of it) may\nnot entirely accurately specify how in fact we think and act, it does\nspecify how we ought to think and act. \n\nAssume everyday psychology is uniquely self-justifying in the way\nGrice suggests; then we must reject the suggestion that everyday\npsychology is just a rough and ready theory that we will (or could)\neventually abandon without loss in favor of a more accurate and\ncomplete scientific theory of behavior. Grice objects on this ground\nto theories that regard only scientific knowledge as truly descriptive\nand explanatory and that relegate commonsense psychological\nexplanation to a second-class role as a theory, useful in daily life,\nbut not a theory we should endorse as a description or explanation of\nreality. Grice remarks: \n\nThus, to return briefly to the theory of meaning, the picture that\ntheory offers of ourselves as rational communicators producing\njustified psychological attitudes in each other is no mere accident, no\nexplanatory way station to be abandoned as science progresses. It is an\nineliminable feature of the way in which we understand ourselves and\nothers. In addition to this result, Grice’s view of psychological\nexplanation also yield consequences both for ontology and for\nethics. \n\nGrice’s ontological views are liberal. As Grice says when\ncommenting on the mind—body problem in ‘Method in\nPhilosophical Psychology’, \n\nOur discussion of psychological explanation shows what Grice had in\nmind in his reference to entities that “come on the\nrecommendation of some form of transcendental argument, [and hence]\nmay qualify for the specially favoured status of entia\nrealissima.” Suppose—as Grice thinks—certain \nway of thinking, certain categories, are part of what\nis entrenched. Then there are certain concepts or categories that we\ncannot avoid applying to reality. \n\nThis theme will not be pursued further here; rather, we turn to the\nmore “Marxist” side of Grice’s ontology: the claim\nthat if entities work, they exist. We illustrate this point with the\nconcept of a proposition. The critical role of that notion in\nGrice’s theory of meaning motivates our focus on it. Quinean\ncriticisms of the notion have placed under it under a cloud of\nsuspicion, a cloud many see as hanging ominously over Grice’s\ntheory. \n\nOne of Quine’s arguments is that synonymy is not a well-defined\nequivalence relation, the identity conditions for propositions are\nunclear and there is ‘no entity without identity’. On this\nissue, Grice is not committed to an equivalence relation of synonymy\n(thus his remark above about indeterminacy), and he parts company with\nQuine over whether clear identity conditions are required. Grice, as\nnoted earlier, argues for such conditions. But the acceptability of\nhis theory of meaning does not depend on the success of that\ndefense. Within the theory of meaning, propositions are theoretical\nentities to be understood by the role in the theory, and that role,\naccording to Grice, does not demand a strict criterion of\nidentity. Rather: if they work they exist. It is worth noting in this\nregard that there are many respectable entities for which we do not\nhave criteria or identity. Suppose my favorite restaurant moves. Is\nit a new restaurant with the same name? Or suppose it changes owners\nand names but nothing else? Or that it changes menu entirely? Or that\nit changes chefs? It would be foolish to look for a single criterion\nto answer these questions—the answers go different ways in\ndifferent contexts. But surely the concept of a restaurant is a\nuseful one and restaurants do exists. Quine and Grice differ on the\ntheoretical usefulness of propositions. The main reason for\ndisagreement is due to Quine’s attitude that concepts such as belief\nand desire are of, at most, secondary importance in the unified\ncanonical science that is his standard for ontology. Grice, as we have\nalready noted, thinks that everyday psychological theory is of first\nimportance. \n\nGrice was constantly concerned with philosophical methodology, and the\ndiscussion so far omits one important methodological focus: ordinary\nlanguage philosophy. Although it was by no means Grice’s sole\nphilosophical commitment, it was a central one.\n \n\nGrice is a well-known critic of ordinary language philosophy,\nand one of his main targets was J. L. Austin and a style of reasoning\nhe popularized. Austin thought there was a relatively clear notion of\nwhat it is inappropriate to say, and that we could delineate\ntruth-conditions by identifying instances of inappropriateness\n(Warner, 2012). For example, he inferred from (1) “Typically, when one\nacts, it would be inappropriate to say either that one acted\nvoluntarily or that one acted involuntarily” to (2) “Typically, when\none acts, one acts neither voluntarily nor involuntarily.” As Grice\nconvincingly argues, the inference fails because being untrue is not\nthe only form of inappropriateness. Something may be true but\ninappropriate to say for other reasons (Grice 1960, 1975, 1981, 1989).\n \nGrice was, however, also a life-long practitioner of ordinary language\nphilosophy. He begins the “Prolegomena” to Studies in the Way of\nWords by noting that “some may regard [ordinary language\nphilosophy] as an outdated style of philosophy,” but he urges us “not\nto be too quick to write off such a style.” Instead, he urges us to\nbuild “a theory which will enable one to distinguish between the case\nin which an utterance is false or fails to be true, or more generally\nfails to correspond to the world in some favored way, and the case in\nwhich it is inappropriate for reasons of a different kind” (Grice\n1989, 4). Much of Studies in the Way of Words addresses this\ntask.\n \nWhy bother to build such a theory? There are many possible answers,\nand Grice would no doubt have given more than one, but we focus on\njust one answer, which is implicit in this work. Recall that, on his\nview, commonsense psychology consists, at least in part, of a body of\nself-justifying descriptive, explanatory, and evaluative\nprinciples. The principles are ‘self-justifying’ in the sense\nexplained earlier in section 6. An illuminating description of these\nprinciples would be an illuminating description of how we think, and\nsuch a description would certainly be of interest. How do we get one?\nBy carefully examining what we say. Two tenets of ordinary language\nphilosophy were that a clear view of what we mean in the\nlanguage we use is a clear view of what we think, and that a\nnecessary step in getting clear view of what we mean is close\nattention to the details of what we say. But the detailed\nexamination will only reveal what we mean if we can reliably\ndistinguish between “the case in which an utterance is\nfalse or fails to be true, or more generally fails to correspond to\nthe world in some favored way, and the case in which it is\ninappropriate for reasons of a different kind.”\n \n\nGrice uses this general account of reasoning to investigate moral\nreasoning and moral reasons. He emphasizes the connections between\nreasons, actions, and freedom. It is convenient to divide Grice’s\napproach into two stages (although he himself does not do so). The\nfirst stage argues that one must regard the exercise of rationality in\nthe free adoption and pursuit of ends as an unrelativized good at which\nall persons should aim. The second stage examines the concepts of\nhappiness and freedom to discover principles which\npersons—conceived of as rationally adopting and pursuing\nends—must adopt insofar as they are to qualify as rational. \n\nThe first stage. Why think that one must regard the\nexercise of rationality in the free adoption and pursuit of ends as an\nunrelativized good at which all persons should aim? To begin with, what\ndoes Grice mean by an “unrelativized good”? Grice grants\nthat the concept of unrelativized value requires defense; after all,\nthings have value only relative to ends and beneficiaries. So how is\nunrelativized value to be understood? Grice defines unrelativized value\n“in Aristotelian style [as] whatever would seem to possess such\nvalue in the eyes of a duly accredited judge; and a duly accredited\njudge might be identifiable as a good person operating in conditions of\nfreedom.” (Of course, this is still to talk about what is of\nvalue for and to persons; the point is to avoid relativization to this\nor that kind of person or kind of end.) So,\nwhy would a duly accredited judge see value in the free rational\nadoption and pursuit of ends, where such value is not ascribed\nbecause of the contribution that activity makes to some other\nend? \n\nGrice’s views on commonsense psychology provide the answer. As\nnoted earlier, Grice thinks that commonsense psychology exhibits two\nfeatures: parts of it are self-justifying; and, it contains principles\nfor evaluating thought and action, where some of those principles are\nself-justifying. When he turns to ethics, Grice adds that commonsense\npsychology represents us as exercising rationality in freely adopting\nand pursuing ends; moreover, this view of ourselves is self-justifying\nin the sense that we cannot coherently conceive of ourselves in any\nother way. Grice’s—very plausible—claim is that a\n“duly accredited judge” operating from within the theory of\ncommonsense psychology would take the rational, free adoption and\npursuit of ends as having unrelativized value. Hence, it does have such\nvalue. \n\nThe second stage: What principles must a free adopter and\npursuer of ends embrace in order to qualify as rational? Grice\naddresses this question most fully in Aspects of Reason and\nThe Conception of Value. The idea is that the combined\nrequirements of rationality (outside ethics), freedom, and happiness\nimpose substantive constraints on all persons. Grice develops this\ntheme with great insight and subtlety; however, he did not complete the\nproject, and the intricacies of his views are best left to the detail\nof his own works. \n\nThe sophistication and inventiveness of Grice’s work is\nwell-known. What is less well-known is its ambitious and systematic\nnature. Emphasizing this latter aspect has been one goal of this brief\npresentation of Grice’s work, work which weaves meaning,\nreasoning, psychology, ontology, and value into a complex, unified\nwhole.","contact.mail":"rwarner@kentlaw.edu","contact.domain":"kentlaw.edu"}]
