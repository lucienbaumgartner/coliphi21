Born and raised a short\ndistance from Edinburgh and well versed in the intellectual life of\nthe city, she urges a philosophy adamantly opposed to main tenets of\nthe Scottish school. She finds them unable to sustain scientific\ninquiry, everyday practical reasoning, and belief in an almighty\ndeity. Her aim is to replace them with a metaphysics consisting of\nexistential beliefs held for good reasons. An analysis of causality is\nprimary in her theory. She contends that the relation between cause\nand effect is one of efficacy, necessity, and simultaneity. The first\nof her two books, Essay upon the Relation of Cause and Effect\n(Shepherd 1824; abbreviated ERCE), is chiefly concerned with deriving\nand developing this doctrine while pointing to errors in the reasoning\nof Hume and his followers on this subject. Her second volume (Shepherd\n1827a) has two parts. The first is a long treatise Essay on the\nAcademical or Skeptical Philosophy (abbreviated EASP) which uses\ncausal reasoning to explain the origin and justification of\nexistential beliefs with regard to the external world, ourselves, and\nGod. The second consists of shorter essays said to be illustrative of\ndoctrines contained in the first part of this volume and the earlier\none published under her name. Her theory of knowledge is neither\nrationalist nor empiricist; it takes all knowledge to unify passively\nreceived sensations with principles drawn from the faculty of reason,\nso that knowledge of all sorts is at once felt and represented\ndiscursively. In this respect, her position is more like that of Kant\nthan like those of her other early modern predecessors. But her\nmetaphysics and theory of the justification of existential beliefs are\ndistinctive of her philosophical system. \n\n\nShepherd’s wide social circle included men and women of science,\nliterary figures and others of intellectual accomplishment, and she\nenjoyed discussing metaphysical topics. This may have helped to garner\nan audience for her work. Its merits were publicly acknowledged in\nseveral ways. There is good evidence that one of her monographs was\nused as a textbook at Cambridge. Her part of a sharp philosophical\ndispute was published in a monthly magazine. Her theory of mind and\nself are the subject of an entry in Robert Blakey’s multi-volume\nHistory of the Philosophy of Mind (1850). After her death and\nbefore its recent recovery, her philosophy dropped from view for\nreasons that are not entirely clear (Atherton 2005; Paoletti 2011). \n\nIn addition to a short biographical entry in the Oxford Dictionary\nof National Biography (Perkins 2004), the main source of\ninformation about Shepherd’s life is a family memoire written by\nher daughter and published for private use (Brandreath 1886). Shepherd\nwas born in Barnbougle Castle on the Primrose family estate\noverlooking the Firth of Forth. She lived mainly there until her\nmarriage in 1808. While her brothers were sent to university, she and\nher sisters were educated at home by private tutor. Her daughter\nreports that in addition to teaching them Latin, geography,\nmathematics, and history, he discussed many works on the foundation of\nthe truth of things. His pupils were encouraged to pursue whatever\nsubjects interested them. Mary is said to have written volumes of\nmetaphysical essays many of them critical of Hume and the Unitarian\ndoctrines of Joseph Priestly (Brandreath 1886: 28–9). In a\nletter to Charles Babbage, she recalls having had an interest in the\nreasoning used in proofs of mathematical theorems and exposing errors\nof reasoning in a wide range of authors (quoted in McRobert 2000: vi).\nHer published essays were written sometime later. \nShepherd’s dismay at the influence of Hume’s treatment of\ncausality can be traced at least to a controversy in Edinburgh which\nbegan in 1802 when she was living nearby. The clergymen of the city\nopposed the appointment of an eminent mathematician to a chair at the\nUniversity because of a passing favorable remark on Hume’s\naccount of causality. They thought it encouraged atheism whereas the\nacademic community insisted on the freedom of inquiry. With Hume back\nin public view, Thomas Brown published a small tract critical of some\naspects of his doctrine but denying its supposed atheistic implication\n(Brown 1805). It was well received and Brown went on to write a full\nlength book urging that causality implies nothing but the temporal\nsuccession and regular conjunction of sorts of events; it was first\nprinted in 1818 and reprinted thereafter (Brown 1822). Shepherd\nmentions the Edinburgh incident and the still growing influence of\nBrown’s theory in the book she published in 1824. In her view,\nit is evidence of the public’s susceptibility to the pernicious\ninfluence of Hume on notions of causality. Both her books illustrate\nits ill effects by discussing the conclusions and theories of Thomas\nLawrence, a controversial Lecturer in Physiology (Paoletti 2011: 49).\n \nThere is some evidence that Shepherd anonymously published a book\ncritical of Brown in 1819, the year after his treatise on causality\nappeared. This is suggested by a note attached to a volume in the\nCambridge University Library which is included in the facsimile\nreproduction of Shepherd’s philosophical works edited by\nJennifer McRobert. This book has two parts: one compares the causal\ntheories of Brown and Hume with observations “calculated to shew\nthe inconsistency of these theories”; its treatment of causality\nis said to be inspired by recent developments in chemical science. The\nother, titled “New Theory of the Earth”, proposes to\nexplain the origin of prominent features of the earth on the basis of\nmotions due to gravitational force, various conflagrations and\ncollisions. There may be a connection between the view of causality\nurged in this volume and the books published under her name. But the\nfactual objections to Hume are tame in comparison with the logical\ncritique and ambitious metaphysical and epistemic system in the later\nvolumes. Although Shepherd’s authorship of the earlier book is\nprobable, it is not entirely certain.  \nIn the early 1820s, Shepherd accompanied her husband to Cambridge\nwhile he studied for a master’s degree, awarded in 1823.\nAlthough there seems to be no record of the people she conversed with\nthere, it might well be that William Whewell, who held a university\nfellowship at this time, was among them. She also may have meet\nCharles Babbage there; he was a friend of the couple later on and both\nof them corresponded with him. If she met Whewell at this time, it\nwould be notable for several reasons. As the memoire records, it was\nhe who made one of Shepherd’s works a university text book. He\nwas deeply interested in devising a workable and productive method of\nempirical inquiry, but it was not until 1860 that his theory of\nscientific induction was accomplished (Snyder 2012).  \nEven at the time Shepherd and her husband resided in Cambridge,\nWhewell was the leader of a group of four friends who were undertaking\nto reform the practice of the sciences. Taking Francis Bacon’s\nThe Great Instauration (1620) as starting point, they vowed\nto work as philosophers and scientists to regularize the practice of\nscience, expand it, and orient it to the improvement of human lives.\nTogether with others, they had considerable success in this endeavor\nover the next four decades. Of the four friends, three proposed\nmethods of induction for natural science, each of them opposed to that\nof the others. Whewell’s methodology, which is the most fully\ndeveloped, is like Shepherd’s in being neither rationalist nor\nempiricist, but combining ideas drawn from the mind itself with\nempirical input. Whether or not Shepherd meet any one in this circle\nprior to publishing her first book, she shared with them a deep\nconviction that the current state of philosophy was inadequate to\nsupport scientific inquiry. She undertook to put causal reasoning in\nall areas of human endeavor including empirical research on firm\nmetaphysical and epistemic foundations (also McRobert 2002 under\n Other Internet Resources).\n  \nHer daughter writes that Whewell was a frequent guest of the couple\nwhose main residence was in London. He is listed as one of six friends\nwho were particularly attuned to Shepherd’s passion for abstract\nmetaphysical thinking. She also reports that he and Charles Lyle spoke\nof her mother as “an unanswerable logician” (Brandreath\n1886: 29). Sometime after Mary Shepherd’s death, Whewell is said\nto have asked whether she had written essays that were unpublished\nand, if so, advised they be brought to light.  \nShepherd’s two longer essays develop a doctrine of cause and\neffect and the beliefs it underwrites. The shorter essays collected in\nShepherd’s second volume range over related specific topics\nincluding: Berkeley’s philosophy, the co-incidence of extension\nand color, the credibility of miracles, nature of final cause, and the\nreason of single erect vision. In addition to works mentioned above,\nthere are three published works of Shepherd: critical remarks on the\nmetaphysics of John Fearn, a retired naval officer (Shepherd 1832); a\nvery effective reply to Fearn’s counter-critique of her\nmetaphysics; and an article on the single and erect object of vision\n(Shepherd 1827b). In the present article, we will focus on her two\nmain philosophical works but consider some directly relevant material\nfrom the shorter essays.  \nShepherd’s doctrines regarding causality are advertised as\ncontrary to those of David Hume. They are often presented in\nconnection with a theory of knowledge opposed to the radical\nempiricism and nominalism of her primary\nfoil.[1] Where\nHume holds that common causal beliefs are due to acquired habits of\nimagination rather than operations of reason, she urges they are\ncaused by reason. Where Hume holds that abstract ideas are impossible,\nShepherd insists that science and philosophical analysis are\nimpossible without them. Like Hume, she often uses\n“reason” to refer to a cognitive faculty rather than a\nsort of justification of belief (Garrett 1997; Owen 1999). But for\nher, the faculty is the source of abstract ideas of cause, effect, and\ncontinued existence, among others. Human reason is naturally disposed\nto deploy these ideas when the youngest of children first begin to\nperceive by sense (EPEU: 314). Some readers extract the metaphysics\nfrom the attendant nativist theory of knowledge. But the texts offer\nno non-question begging argument for her central metaphysical\ndoctrine. They assume the theory of causality they purport to\nprove. This appears to be damaging unless her epistemology is taken\ninto account. As she sees it, the common convictions regarding cause\nand effect are products of a natural predisposition of human reason;\nthis explains why we believe them.  Their origin does not justify\nassent to them, but Shepherd undertakes to show that there is\njustification for it.  \nThe primary tenet of her metaphysics is the causal principle: it is\nnecessary that a thing that begins to exist has a cause (hereafter\n“CP”). The argument for this contentious claim begins with\na clarification meant to avoid the merely semantic connection of\n“cause” and “effect”. To grasp the conditions\nin which something begins to exist, one needs to abstract from\nfamiliar things except with regard to the capacity for existence. With\nthis understood, it is a contradiction to suppose that something\nbegins to exist if nothing else exists because  \nthis beginning to exist cannot appear but as a capacity\nsome nature hath to alter the presupposed nonentity, and to act\nfor itself, whilst itself is not in being. (ERCE: 36)  \nAs I understand it: a beginning to exist is an act, or actualization,\nof a capacity; an act is a property of some object; an object cannot\nhave a property if it does not exist; so nothing can begin to exist\nwithout something else that acts. Although this is valid, the first\npremise assumes what the argument is meant to prove by characterizing\na beginning of existence as an act of an object other than\n it.[2] \nAll derivations of the contradiction found in the texts have premises\nformulated in the terminology of the theory of cause and effect\nShepherd\n urges.[3]\n Most of them refer to things that begin to exist as\n“qualities” of objects (see the series of definitions,\nERCE: 63–4). According to the list of anti-Humean definitions:\n“Necessary connexion of cause and effect is the obligation\nqualities have to inhere in their objects” (ERCE: 63). A cause\nis defined as  \nsuch an action of an object, as shall enable it, in conjunction with\nanother, to form a new nature, capable of exhibiting qualities varying\nfrom those of either object in separation from the other. This is\nreally to be a producer of new being. (ERCE: 63)  \nThat is, causation is a complex metaphysical configuration comprising:\n(1) the antecedent existence of two or more objects which taken\ntogether ground the capacity for the existence of some quality\nQ when it does not yet exist and (2) a change in which the\nobjects unite to form a different object which determines the\nexistence of Q because Q necessarily belongs to it. \nThis model of causality is assumed in some way in every demonstration\nthat it is necessary that a thing that begins to exist have a cause.\nMost of them presume that the idea of a thing not yet in existence is\nthe idea of the capacity for its existence. This is not the bare\nlogical possibility of something X, but the actual existence of\ntwo or more things with the potential to actualize X. Under\nthis conception, it is a contradiction to suppose a thing that begins\nto exist has no cause, but the key conception is taken for granted.\nThere is no effort to prove the highly contentions notion that a thing\nthat beings to exist must be preceded by the existence of the capacity\nfor its existence.  So the conclusion that a cause is necessary would\nseem to be the natural product of nothing other than the human mind, a\ntautology framed from ideas all of which originate in the faculty of\n reason.[4]\n It is commonly believed to be a necessarily true of the real world but\nthis remains to be justified. \nAccording to Shepherd’s definition, causality is a compositional\ndetermination relation. The pre-existing entities which combine to\nform a cause are variously called “objects”,\n“natures”, “masses of qualities”, and\n“unknown circumstances in nature”, among other things. By\n“objects”, Shepherd means things in natural kinds, e.g., a\nfire, a log, and bread. In general, an object is a “mass of\nqualities” which is or may be perceived by sense (ERCE: 64). The\nobject is “nothing distinct from its qualities” (ERCE:\n161–2). “[I]n this union, Cause and Effect, are\nsynchronous, and they are but different words for the same\nEssence” (ERCE:\n 57).[5]\n Regarded in this way, a quality belongs to an object as a part\nbelongs to a whole, not that in which a predicate belongs to a\nsubject. But although cause and effect are one essence, there is some\ndifference between them: one is really productive of the\nother. The cause determines the qualities included in the mass. In\neffect, the ideas of cause and effect are two ways of representing the\nsame thing which are not entirely without basis in the thing. With\nregard to the term “nature, it is sometimes used to stand for\nthe unknown causes of the sensory appearances which come to exist when\nobjects are perceived by sense.  \nThe productive aspect of an object is called a “power”,\ndefined as a productive principle, or “property which\nlies in the secret nature of objects” and determines the\nqualities which will be perceived if the object unites with various\nother objects and the natures that constitute a perceiver (ERCE: 64).\nFantl (2016: 97) maintains that powers are basic in Shepherd’s\nmetaphysics suggesting that objects are fundamentally constituted by\nactivities, or forces of the sorts envisaged by Leibniz or Priestly.\n \nOnce an efficacious combination is formed it may unite with other\nobjects to form compounds productive of newly existing qualities. The\ncauses of most familiar phenomena are formed from a large number of\npre-existing objects and other circumstances (e.g., time) all of which\nare required to produce the observed effect. But the objects from\nwhich a cause is formed need not have qualities similar to those of\nthe newly constituted cause. None of the qualities going into the\ncompound may be retained and it may join with others to form many\ndifferent masses of qualities. Still compound natures such as plants,\nanimals, and the sentient principle (or mind) are not destroyed by\nentering into a succession of mixtures.  \nShepherd does not contend that every change has a cause. The\nmetaphysical structure of a change and that of a cause are entirely\ndifferent. A change takes place over time and the relation between its\nearlier and later stages is contingent. Shepherd argues that precisely\nbecause Hume supposes that a cause and its effect exist in succession,\nhe precludes their having a necessary or efficacious connection\n(Bolton 2010: 244). For\nShepherd, a change results in a cause if and only if it terminates in\na composite efficacious nature that did not exist when the change\nbegan. So it might seem that her view cannot account for what Hume\npurports to explain—the transition involved in a change.  \nBut it can offer a non-causal explanation of change: a change is the\nconsequence of the qualities of several different objects persisting\nover some period of time. Qualities are simultaneous with their causes\nbut they need not be instantaneous or short-lived. Motion is a\nquality. Several moving objects which continue to exist for some time\nmay arrive at a mutual configuration that produces qualities which did\nnot previously exist, e.g., several moving globs of paint and a canvas\ncollide. The collision is explained by the paths of the moving objects\nprior to their union in an artistic composition. Shepherd contrasts\nthe necessary connection of cause and effect with a sort of necessary\nconnection between temporal antecedents and consequents (EASP: 131).\nThe latter is the invariable sequence of successive effects produced\nby the same object meeting with several different objects in a regular\norder, e.g., when eating bread, one typically has successive\nsensations of yielding texture, taste, and fullness in the stomach. It\nis necessary that if a piece of bread mixes with the sensory organs in\nthe usual order--hands, mouth and tongue, stomach—this series of\nsensations occurs (EASP: 125–30).\n \nA principle of induction is deduced from CP: it is necessary that\nsimilar causes have similar effects (hereafter CPI). Suppose two\nindividually different causes are alike. If their effects were\ndifferent, they would not have a cause; this is impossible according\nto CP. Often the same point is put this way: a difference must have a\ncause. If the qualities of an object are different at one time than\nanother, the difference must have a cause; for the same reason, if\nindividually different objects differ in respect of the presence or\nabsence of any quality, the difference must have a cause.  \nCP and CPI are used to argue that it is not possible that the course\nof nature should change as Hume supposes\n [6]\n The argument assumes that natural kinds of objects are defined and\nindividuated by all the qualities that belong to the same mass, or\nsame cause. Shepherd rebuts Hume’s contrary claim by refuting\nhis examples. She allows the possibility that stuff that tastes like\nsalt and has sensible qualities otherwise like those of snow might\nfall from the clouds, but CPI requires that the difference between\nthem has a cause. Each is an efficacious compound different in kind\nfrom the other, and only one is properly called “snow”\n(ERCE: 69). Again, Hume supposes nature might alter the “secret\ncauses” while keeping the sensible qualities the same, but this\nis impossible according to CPI. In general, no matter how unexpected\nthe qualities collected in an object may be in the future, it cannot\nalter the way qualities are determined to exist.  \nOn Shepherd’s theory, we perceive particular things by sense\nbecause they affect the sensory organs and thereby produce sensations\nthat simultaneously begin to appear in consciousness. This prompts the\nmind to implement “latent reasoning”: this sensation began\nto exist; it must have a cause; so there is something that is its\ncause. Reason need not rehearse this argument, but it attaches to the\nsensation an idea that (purportedly) represents a particular thing\nthat causes the sensation. It is believed to exist, but only its\neffect appears in consciousness. To be clear, the state in which a\nperson perceives an object by sense comprises several things: (1) an\nobject, or mass of qualities which can be perceived by sense, (2) the\nmixture of the object with the mind and sensory organs of a perceiver,\n(3) a sensation caused by this mixture which simultaneously begins to\nappear in awareness, (4) an idea produced by reason which\n(purportedly) represents the cause of the sensation and belief that\nthe cause exists. That said, a mass of sensible qualities is known\nonly as the cause of sensations which appear in consciousness. We are\nacquainted with nothing but the sensations and have only an idea that\nrefers to something as its cause. So when sensible qualities are not\nperceived and considered in abstraction from their effects on our\nsenses, they are “unknown powers or qualities” (ERCE:\n46–7); “the positive nature and essence of unperceived\nbeings cannot be known” (EASP: 243). In sum, an operation of\nreason prompted by a sensation that begins to exist in consciousness\ngenerates belief that the sensation is caused by something else.  \nIn some circumstances, a person may form a reasonable belief that the\nexciting cause of the appearance of a certain sensation at one time is\na certain object perceived by sense at a proximate time. The\n“exciting” cause is the component of the entire cause\nwhich is present just at the moment the effect occurs and absent\nwhenever it does not occur; other requisites of the cause are\nrelatively permanent conditions which may be known or unknown. A\nbelief that such-and-such an object is the exciting cause of\nsuch-and-such effect arises from perception of similarities and\ndifferences among successive sensations. This may prompt another\nimplicit rudimentary argument: this sensation has a cause; the cause\nis some entity (perhaps consisting of several objects) that was not\npresent before the sensation appeared and was present at the moment it\nappeared; there is one and only one thing of which this is true; so it\nis the exciting cause of the sensation. Her example is finding that a\nview is present in consciousness when you open your eyes and absent\nwhen you close them. Because the position of the eyelids is the one\nand only candidate to be the exciting cause, you are likely to believe\nit is the active cause. Shepherd is well aware that such a belief\nmight be mistaken. Still, she maintains that we form many beliefs in\nthis simple way, and a great many of them turn out to be true. More\nexacting purposes demand beliefs that are formed with more care (see\n 5.1), but the basic reasoning\nis the same.  \nCPI licenses a different rudimentary argument. If a person believes\nthat one particular thing caused another, e.g., the mixture of samples\nof blue and yellow pigment caused the quality green to begin to\nexist; the inductive principle underwrites the inference that any\ncompound similar to the first must have a similar effect. To be sure,\nit is often very difficult to collect evidence that two particular\nthings have similar natures, because natures do not appear in\nawareness and it is impossible to examine all the effects of two\nindividuals in an effort to learn whether the unknown natures are the\nsame. Yet Shepherd explains that, under favorable conditions, we may\ncome to believe they are the same with a high degree of probability\n(see\n § 5.1).\n The inductive reasoning just described is contrasted with\nHume’s explanation of causal inference in terms of the habitual\nassociation of ideas and their liveliness. It is also compared with\nviews like that of Reid, followed by Brown, on which if we once\nperceive that a thing of one kind follows a thing of another kind, we\nimmediately from the conclusive belief that all things of the first\nkind are followed by those of the second. As Shepherd puts it, we give\nundoubting assent to this law on the evidence of nothing but the law\nitself; yet it has reference to actual things which everyone agrees\ncan only be known from experience. This is to believe without a reason\nto believe, according to Shepherd (ERCE: 136–45; EASP: 144–5). To\nher mind, a belief is irrational if not held for a reason.  \nThe inductive principle applies to mathematics as well as physics.\nShepherd takes arithmetical operations to be procedures for forming\nnumbers out of given numbers; each different number determines\nsomewhat different properties. Geometrical constructions are\nunderstood in the same way. A demonstration is made on a diagram\nconstructed from lines drawn at various distances from each other. The\nproperties of the particular construction are known by inspection. The\nmove from a particular object to all things with similar constitutions\nis licensed by CPI; Shepherd calls this “reasoning on an\nexperiment”. It is true that we are typically more certain of\ngeneral theorems of mathematics than laws of physics. Shepherd\nexplains that this is because we can often be more certain that two\nfigures or numerical values have been formed in the same way because\nwe construct them from known elements by known rules and procedures.\nThere are many questions about the details of her theory of\nmathematical induction which have not, so far, been answered. To\nmention just one, it is not clear whether the method applies just to\narithmetic and geometry or also the method of fluxions, and so\n on.[7] \nIt is notable that mathematical truths in fields to which CPI applies\nare not conditional propositions without existential import. The\ndemonstration of such a truth must be based on a particular and\nobservable instance. Although there are standard procedures for\nconstructing different geometrical and arithmetical objects, the rules\ndo not suffice to deduce the properties of the result. They can be\nknown only from an actual implementation of the rules. The relational\norderings of positions in space, time, and among the numbers\ninevitably affect the base cases of inductive conclusions. So Shepherd\nmaintains that the general truths of natural science which require\nempirical evidence are necessary and the necessary truths of\narithmetic and geometry are believed on the basis of\nexperience. In this respect, Shepherd’s theory is like\nthat of Kant, but they differ over the reality of the entities known.\n \nThe second of Shepherd’s books purports to show that causal\nreasoning is the source of common beliefs about the existence of the\nexternal world, the mind, and the self and to justify them. The threat\nof circular argument is acknowledged at the outset (EASP: xii). The\nearlier volume maintains that human beings naturally believe CP and\nCPI and apply them to things perceived to begin to exist. The later\nEASP uses these principles to generate and justify belief in the\nexistence of objects external to the mind. The circle would be to use\nthe causal principles to prove the existence of external objects and\nto take their existence to justify the assumption that CP has\ninstances in the real world. Shepherd’s response to the threat\nis closely related to the justification for belief in the external\nworld her system affords.  In this section and the next, the various\nbeliefs produced by reasoning based on CP or CPI are discussed. We\npostpone discussion of the circle and the issue of justification to\n section 5\n because the origin of all beliefs discussed in EASP is said to be\nrelevant to it.   Shepherd recognizes two basic cognitive faculties: sense, or the\nability to have sensations of all varieties, and understanding, or the\nability to reason from the occurrence of sensations. Whenever the mind\nproduces an idea, there is a sensation of it. Consciousness is the\ngenus of sensations; sensations are just entities of the sort that\nappear in consciousness (EASP: 135). Its species include sensations of\nsensible qualities, sensations of ideas of memory, ideas of\nimagination, ideas of reason, and so on. Properly speaking, sensations\nof ideas are of nothing but an idea and the idea refers to, or\nrepresents, something considered to be different from the\nsensation. They are not sensations of the thing ideas purport to\nrepresent.  Sensations of the first sort, i.e. sensations of sensible\nqualities, are sensations caused by qualities such as motion and color\nwith aid of the organs of sense.  We follow Shepherd in this use of\n‘sensation’.  We also follow her in using\n‘perception’ to mean the notice taken of sensations.  But\n‘sense perception’ refers to cognition of external objects\nby means of the senses.   \nIn general, the common beliefs to be explained arise from perception\nof relations among the vast number of sensations that accumulate in\nthe course of experience. The perception of recurring patterns of\nsensations stimulates implicit reasoning expressed by ideas that\nrepresent their causes as having continued, external, and independent\nexistence. Belief that objects perceived by sense continue to exist\nwhen not perceived is the topic of this sub-section. \nAccording to Shepherd, we have, at every moment, the unacquired, or native, idea\nof continued existence. The sensation (idea) of it attends all\nsensations of the sort introduced by action of the organs of sense\n(EASP: 13); I call these “sensory sensations”. When the\nidea of continued existence is formed, it represents the cause of the\nperceived constancy with which recurring patterns of sensory\nsensations appear and disappear. When you look at a house while\nwalking by, a series of visual sensations appears and when you retrace\nyour steps a similar series appears in reverse order. More generally,\nsensations of the motions of your limbs and sensory organs constantly\nappear in conjunction with trains of sensory sensations which vary\nwith the location of your eyes, hands, and so on. Each different\nsensation has a different cause. But repeated perception of the\nconstant conjunction of sensations of motions of the sensory organs\nand sensory sensations prompts reason to generate the idea of the\ncontinued existence of their causes in accord with the implicit\nargument: unless things are created purposely in order to be ready to\n\nappear, they must continue to exist ready to appear if suitably\nrelated to organs of sense (EASP: 13–14). If it were the case\nthat the causes of sensory sensations arose and perished as the\nsensations do, then sensible objects, bodily organs, space, time, and\neverything else required for perception, would arise just when needed\nfor perception and perish immediately afterward. The argument is meant\nto expose the utter absurdity of this.  \nThe fact is, according to Shepherd, most people believe that their\nsensations have continued existence, even though they readily\nallow that pleasures, pains, and various other sensations cease to\n\nexist when they disappear from consciousness (EASP: 9). She denies\nthat sensations that exist unperceived can be understood. It is rather\nimagination that associates sensations with ideas that represent\nobjects perceived by sense as existing unperceived. The mind has no\nresources for thinking of such objects except under the form of their\nsensory appearances. Although the error in supposing sensations exist\nunperceived can be exposed, this hardly prevents our frequently\nfalling into it. Yet this is not entirely unfortunate, as Shepherd sees\nit, because it is the means by which we acquire structural as well as\nexistential knowledge of the external world (see\n § 5.2).\n  \nExternal existence contrasts with internal existence. Shepherd has a\nlayered definition of this pair of notions. In the first instance,\ninternal existence pertains to the capacity for sensation in general,\nthat is the mind, or power of thought and feeling. External existence\npertains to the exciting cause of any particular sensation (EASP: 40).\nIn context of CP, nothing that satisfies one of these definitions can\nsatisfy the other. A mixture of both is necessary for the existence of\na sensation. Now sensations are nothing other than appearances in\nconsciousness, realizations of the general capacity for sensations,\ni.e., the mind. With this in view, Shepherd advances the thick notion\nof internal existence: an entity is thickly internal just in case one\nand only individual can be conscious of it. A thing is thickly\nexternal, then, just in case it can be perceived by more than one\nhuman being. The thick distinction marks the difference between what\nis private and what is public. \nThe thick distinction divides the subjective and objective components of\nsense perception. As Shepherd notes, philosophers take very different\nviews on this division, citing Malebranche, Leibniz, Reid, and\nBerkeley. She contends that we tend to adhere to the inner-outer\ndistinction just described because it is produced by the natural\nmental activity of making causal inferences from the perception that\nsensations begin to appear in consciousness. In this sub-section, we\nconsider the details of the origin of this inner-outer distinction and\nbelief in the external existence of sensible objects.  \nIn view of the fact that we cease to be conscious of anything in\ndreamless sleep, it is evident that all sensations begin and cease to\nexist. There must be some continually existing cause capable of\nrenewing them as we believe. The present question is how the continued\nentity which enters into the causes of all one’s sensations,\nwithout exception, is to be conceived. The ears, nose, and other\norgans of sense are objects of perception which we believe to exist\nwhen unperceived. But they are not the continued cause that is wanted\nbecause sensations that occur in dreams have exciting causes which do\nnot continue when these sensations cease to exist. The continually\nexisting cause of all renewed sensations whatsoever must be a subject\nof change that pre-exists and is altered by whatever sensations appear\nin consciousness. The mind thus comes to be conceived as a general\ncapacity for sensation external to all its sensations, independent of\nthem, and ready to be altered by any exciting cause that mixes with it\n–a thinly internal existent. Shepherd observes that\n“I” always refers to something abstract.  \nAs for the common belief that objects of sense perception have\nexternal existence, it is said to arise from little more than the\nimplicit reasoning that refers sensations induced by the sensory\nsystem to objects that continue to exist. The addition is that the\nsensory organs are supposed to act mechanically, to have contact with\nobjects with which they join in causing sensations. The mechanical\ncharacter of the interaction of sensory organs and objects of sense\nperception is taken to imply that the objects can be perceived by\nconjunction with the sensory systems of more than one human being if\nmore than one exists.  \nThe factors that make us believe in external existence of objects of\nperception are said to suffice for assent to their independence.\nBelief that objects are perceivable by more than one human being tends\nto produce belief that their existence is independent of any\nparticular human being. A second source of belief in independence is\nthat we infer that while objects exist unperceived they undergo\nchange; a fire viewed at one time and again an hour later may have\ndied down in the meantime. The most important source is that we\nperceive objects whose sensory appearance is very like that of\nourselves. We suppose the appearances are caused by things like\nourselves and infer that they are like us in having sensations and\nthoughts. Since their thoughts and sensations are not perceived by us,\nthis leads to the belief that their existence is independent of ours. But\nalthough Shepherd clearly maintains that these arguments affect our\ncredence, none of them is definitive proof that objects are\nindependent of an individual mind. \nThe phenomena of dreams are sometimes raised as an objection to the common\nbeliefs about the existence of sensible objects because we may believe\nthat the illusions of a dream have continued, external, and\nindependent existence. This is reason to doubt the existence of all\nperceptual objects unless we have better evidence for their reality\nthan we have for that of the seeming objects of dreams. Shepherd\ndispatches the objection, but with a proviso. She maintains that the\nsensations that occur in dreams are just like those that occur in\nwaking experience. But when dreaming, a person’s ability to\namass a large number of sensations is limited. When awake, a person\ncan discover that the seeming objects of dreams do not “fulfill\ntheir definitions” by moving the eyes, hands, and so on. We\nthink of perceptual objects as belonging to various kinds to which we\ngive names and definitions. Shepherd maintains that a general name\nsuch as “apple” is defined in terms of its sensible\nqualities--round, juicy, sweet smelling, etc.--and its effects when\ncompounded with other sorts of objects-- providing nourishment if\neaten, turning brown if exposed to air, and the like—and its\ncapacity to be perceived by more than one human being; that is, the\ndefinition includes all the object’s sensible effects,\nqualities, and powers. If we dream of an apple, we wake up to find\nnothing that can be felt, tasted, or perceived to interact with other\nobjects as things properly called “apple” do; this shows\nit wasn’t real. On the other hand, the more evidence we have\nthat a purported object appears and behaves as apples do, the more\nprobable the belief that the supposed apple exists in the world.\nProvided that we can detect the illusions of dreams on this basis, the\nfact that we dream is no reason to doubt beliefs about the existence\nof sensible objects in general.  \nNevertheless, there is a remaining doubt about the independence of\nobjects of perception from a perceiver. Shepherd claims this is the\nonly possible doubt with regard to CPI: experience\ncannot show that there is no unperceivable dependence relation among\nall the masses of qualities an individual purportedly perceives (EASP:\n117–8). If this is the case, then all of these masses have a\nbond of interdependence with the cause of one person’s dreams,\ncauses which are internal to this person. So, the demise of this one\nindividual will dissolve the universe. Causal reasoning is of no use\nagainst this possibility, because if it obtains, the independence of\ncauses in general is compromised. Ignorance on this point is grounds\nto doubt that any object is independent of the existence of one\nindividual; yet no one can apprehend that this is so.  We confront a\ndilemma: either the universe is dependent on a single human mind or\nthe universe contains something else and causal reasoning has scope in\nwhich to prove the existence of many minds, human beings, and other\nsensible objects. She claims that all human beings immediately reject\nthe former, and have no second thoughts about it. She seems to regard\nit as an unfailing psychological pre-disposition.  \nThe phenomenon of dreams is used to highlight the difference between\nher notion of the sensible world and George Berkeley’s. He\ndefines a sensible thing as nothing but a collection of sensations.\nShepherd complains that this definition is incomplete because it\nexcludes properties of continued and external existence. This is why\nBerkeley’s doctrine is both unconvincing and difficult to refute\naccording to her diagnosis. Atherton (1996) argues that she\nmisunderstands Berkeley’s Idealism. The occurrence of dreams is\noverlooked by Reid and others who maintain that extension, motion, and\nother primary qualities are not sensations, but real qualities\nexisting externally and independently. The fact that extension and\nmotion appear just the same in dreams as in sense experience shows\nthat they are sensations in experience, too. Motion and extension are\ncapable of causing sensations to which we give the same names, but the\ncauses of sensations cannot be sensations according to Shepherd. \nMind, as we saw, is the capacity for sensation in general. All\nsensations begin and cease to exist while mind is understood to be the\ncontinually existing cause that enables sensations to arise when mixed\nwith various exciting causes. What is called “self”\naccording to Shepherd is a particular mind that has the general\ncapacity for sensations including those caused in part by organs of\nsense; a self is a mind united with a living body.  \nShepherd starts by explicating the notion of self. She contends that\nwhenever we are awake, we have sensations of our own existence, life,\nand the extension of the body; ideas of their causes are formed by the\nusual inference. Organs of sense have no special part in causing\nsensations of the sort just mentioned; rather the living body does. We\nconsider this body (as it is unperceived) to be the source of pleasure\nand pain and to be bounded by the skin. What is called\n“self” in addition to the mind is contained within the\nskin. Shepherd concludes that the notion of self is “the notion\nof the conscious sensation of the extension of the body and of a\nsufficient cause for life and sensation in general” (EASP: 62).\nAll the elements of what is called “self” are implied by\nthis notion— general capacities for sensation and life (the mind and body) and the sensations of one’s own existence, life, and the extension of the body.  \nAccording to Shepherd, the idea of the continued existence of\nself has its origin in the perception that the sensation of life is\ninterrupted by dreamless sleep and then resumed; we refer the renewal\nas effect to a cause that continues to exist. The cause is identified\nas the conjunction of the power to sustain life and the powers of\nmemory and sensation. The power of memory is the ability to form ideas\nof memory. Ideas of memory are complex. On Shepherd’s analysis\nthey contain: fainter sensations attended by the idea of the cause of\ntheir originals’ being remote, the perception of a lapse of\ntime, and the perception of one’s own existence going on between\nthe moment of original impression and the present faint sensations.\nThis explanation is evidently so far incomplete. The main difficulty\nis to explain the perception of a lapse of time.  \nShepherd subjects this perception to analysis: the fainter sensations\nare attended by the idea of the present moment and the past moment is\nonly remembered in the present. She maintains that awareness of the\npresent moment and memory of the past moment inspires reasoning to\nthis effect: there must be a continued being in nature capable of\nuniting the two moments. We saw that time, as she understands it, is a\ncontinued existence comprising successive moments. So the perception\nof a lapse of time between a present and past sensation is the idea of\nthe continued existence of time relative to which the present and\nremembered sensations are ordered. \nReturning to an idea of memory, it contains: (1) the idea of a present\nsensation, (2) the idea of a fainter sensation that is now remembered,\n(3) the idea of time as a continued existence, and (4) the idea that\nthe present sensation and the remembered sensation are ordered by\nvirtue of being simultaneous with earlier and later moments of\ntime. In addition, it contains (5) the perception of one’s own\nexistence during the interval between the original perception and the\npresent one.  This is nothing other than perception of the continued\nexistence of oneself, i.e., the conjunction of two capacities that\nconstitute the self.  Their continued existence is inferred from the\nnecessity that these standing causes continue to exist when they are\nnot conjoined with the active causes of particular sensations. \nIn sum, the origin of belief in the continued existence of self is\ncausal reasoning which produces a conjunction of three ideas. These\nare the idea of the general capacity for sensations including those\ncaused by use of the organs of sense, the idea of the capacity to\nsustain life, and the idea of the power to form ideas of\nmemory. Accordingly, belief in the continued existence of self is just\nbelief that the three capacities referred to by these ideas are\ncontinued. They are part of the cause of the sensation of one’s\nexisting over time, but it is interrupted.  According to Shepherd, the\nidentity of self is constituted by nothing other than the continued\nexistence of the union of the the three capacities (EASP:\n154–4). There is no persisting particle, she observes.  \nOn Shepherd’s theory, the human mind and body are different\nessences (EASP: 155–6). This is because the mind is the capacity\nfor sensation in general and the body is the continually existing\ncause of sensations of extension and solidity in the mind. The former\nis the capacity for sensations of extension and inextension, solidity\nand lack of resistance to motion, whereas the latter is the exciting\ncause of just one member of each pair of mutually contrary sensations.\nSo they are different essences. For this reason, it seems possible in\nthe abstract that the mind and the body should exist separately, but\nShepherd reports that the fact of the matter has not been settled. In\npractice, sensation is never known to take place without the essence\nthat causes sensations of extension. Indeed, the living body,\nparticularly the brain, seems to be integral to the cause of sensation\nin the species man. She urges that this does not preclude the\nprobability of resurrection after death because there may be matter\nfiner than that which composes the present human body which is capable\nof causing sensations when conjoined with the human mind (EASP:\n157–9).  \nIn a short essay on the mind’s capacity to form a design,\nShepherd confronts the question how, if at all, the mind can cause\nmotion in the body: how can a state of a conscious being—that of\nconceiving a design and willing to implement it—determine the\nmotion of the body to this end? (Essay XIII, EPEU: 403–05). She\nexplains that when a person forms a plan and decides to carry it out,\nthe conscious state is united with whatever bodily qualities co-exist\nwith it. The union begins a bodily motion directed to an end by the\nmind. The bodily part of the union is the cause of the beginning of\nmotion; it is necessary that this cause be similar to whatever impulse\ncauses other motions. Since we are not conscious of the cause, but\nonly the design and volition, it is impossible for us to know its\nnature. Yet in this respect, the cause of voluntary motion is no more\nmysterious than any other cause. We are acquainted with the effects\nthe living body has on our consciousness, but have no knowledge of its\nnature unperceived.  \nShepherd maintains that the evidence of the existence of sensations is\nimmediate and incontrovertible; they are felt and their existence is\nnothing more than the feeling (EASP: 142). The conclusion of reasoning\nfrom the existence of sensations to that of some cause or other is\nequally certain. But inferences with regard to the existence of\nparticular causes of specific kinds are liable to error both with\nregard to reasoning and lapse of memory. As a result, the evidence we\nhave that a supposed object of a specific kind exists, e.g., an apple\nrather than a crab apple, consists of items of unequal evidential\nvalue.  \nThree sorts of evidence relevant to the existence of an apple are\nmentioned: perceptions of its several sensible qualities, perceptions\nof its effects in conjunction with objects of various sorts, and\nindications of the manner in which it was formed. The evidence we have\nthat, say, a seeming particular thing is an apple might include\nperceptions of its round figure and pleasing taste, observations of\nits turning brown after exposure to air, and report of its having been\npicked from a tree. Let’s call this group of traits\n“T”. To evaluate this evidence, Shepherd invokes\nthe notion of the “apparent cause”. The apparent cause in\nthe case in question is an object of the kind apple. There is a\ncertain regularity with which active causes that belong to the kind\napple exhibit traits T. There may be one or more other kinds of\nobjects that are found to have traits T with greater or less\nregularity. Although things in these other kinds satisfy part of the\ndefinition of the apparent cause, they do not satisfy the\nremainder. \nShepherd’s idea is that the evidence that the object in question\nis an apple should be weighed by the known regularity with which\ntraits T belong to exciting causes that are apples. If the\nknown regularity is unfailing, the evidence on hand makes it highly\nprobable that the object in question is an apple and will behave in\nall circumstances as apples do. In case the known regularity of the\nunion of T and an apple holds in some, but not all cases, the\nprobability that the object is an apple conferred by the evidence\nshould be proportioned to the ratio of the number of particular cases\nin which the regularity holds to the number of cases with traits\nT; this might involve ratios such as that between apples and\npears in our area. Shepherd says we should be skeptical that the\nconjunction of T with apples holds in a particular case, but\nthe degree of skepticism should be no greater than the irregularity of\ntheir conjunction. Yet it is possible that an apple might not exhibit\nsome qualities in the definition of an apple because, although the\ndifference would have a cause, the circumstances might indicate\nconjunction with a miraculous act intended for a certain end (EASP:\n144–7).  \nOn this theory, the evidence for one perceptual belief consists in\npart of other perceptual beliefs. For instance, the belief that a\npurported apple is a real apple may find evidential support from\nperceptual beliefs about what happens when it is exposed to air. It\nmay happen that belief that one object exists supports believe that\nanother does and it, in turn, supports believe that the first exists.\nFor instance, the claim that there is a fire might be based on the\nobservation that it was caused by steel striking flint; but then the\nexternal existence of the steel and flint might be confirmed by\nobserving that their concussion caused fire. Shepherd notes that\nsomeone might think this is arguing in a circle. To put it\ndifferently, it might seem to us that every perceptual belief receives\nits evidential value from nothing but other perceptual\nbeliefs.  Shepherd sees it differently. Other perceptual beliefs are\nrelevant only because we understand that if the actual cause\nof, say, a purported fire is the apparent cause, then it is necessary\nthat the unknown cause at work in the purported case has all the\nqualities in the definition of fire. So CP and CPI are foundational in\nShepherd’s theory of probable belief. Still, we just saw that\nthe probability that the apparent cause of a given effect is the\nactual cause depends on other perceptual beliefs (ERCE:\n124–5).  \nSensations are appearances; their causes are not, but because we are\nbound to think of them in the guise of sensations, philosophical\nanalysis is needed to pry them apart. The former are inner and the\nlatter outer. Objects of perception must remain unknown in the manner\nin which sensations are known. Because a sensation is essentially an\nappearance to consciousness, it cannot be like anything other than a\nsensation in essential respects. However, Shepherd insists that\nsensations have inessential properties that are shared by beings of\nother sorts, such as variety (EASP: 163–4). There must be as\nmuch variety among the causes of sensations as there is among the\nsensations; otherwise CPI would fail. So although  sensations can be\nintrinsically like nothing but sensations, relations among sensations must have a\nlikeness to relations among their causes.  \nThe most interesting examples are collections of sensations each of\nwhich varies from all the others in the same respect, e.g., warmth,\nlength, or duration. Sensations vary “in kind and degree”,\nas Shepherd puts it. All the sensations in the first collection just\nmentioned are alike in being warm, but differ in respect of degrees of\nwarmth. It follows that their causes are alike in respect of some\ngeneral property that admits of degrees and different in its degrees.\nThe external gradable property cannot possibly be like a sensation,\nbut it imparts an order among its grades which is like the order among\ntheir effects. As Shepherd says, the causes of sensations must have\n“the same proportions, in relation to each other among\nthemselves, as the effects have to each other” (EASP:\n28–9). So time, the continuously existent nature that has a part\nin causing sensations that arise successively, consists of positions\nwith mutual relations proportional to the relations among the\ncorresponding sensations. Time is, then, capable of being measured by\nthe idea of a continued external object that undergoes changes of a\nsort deemed suitable to measure the changes in other externally\nexisting things. The durations of the perceptions of, say, beats of a\npendulum thus serve to measure the durations of the beats that cause\nthem. The grades of difference between elements on the corresponding\nsides can be as small or large as observation and reason require. In\naddition to similarity, variety, and proportionality, and contrariety are\nmentioned as a relation common to sensations and their causes: the\ncauses of sensations of motion and rest, solidity and lack of\nresistance to motion, extension and inextension, red and blue,\ndifferent places, etc. must be related as contraries.  \nThe isomorphism of sensory sensations as a whole and their respective\nexternal causes as a whole enables us to have a sort of inferential\nknowledge about sensible objects in addition to their existence. The\norder and comparison of sensations provides information about the\nexternal world in all those respects in which there is structural\nsimilarity between the two domains. Although there are in principle no\nlimits to the abstract similarities that might be discovered by\nstudents of nature, Shepherd stresses similarities that are\nsufficiently close to being complete and exact that we need do little\nmore than attend to relations exhibited by accumulated masses of\nsensations in order to comprehend them. This is the advantage of our\nnatural tendency to associate objects of perception and the sensations\nunder which we are bound to think of them. It obscures the\nmetaphysically important distinction between inner and outer\nexistence, but it facilitates descriptive knowledge of the external\nworld. Shepherd illustrates this by an analogy with algebra. Just as\nalgebraic signs stand for unknown quantities which can be\n“measured, valued, and reasoned upon by their signs”, so\nsensations are signs for their causes which exist under relations\nsimilar to those we observe, calculate, or demonstrate in the domain\nof sensations. As mentioned, we typically give sensations and their\ncauses the same name. So we may speak, think, and reason about\nexternal objects as if they really existed under the forms in which\nthey appear (EASP: 27–8, 47–9, 161–6). Shepherd\nfinds it important to observe that no part of this arrangement is\nsubject to skepticism: the relation between sensations and what they\nsignify is assured by CP and CPI; relations among sensations are\nassured by observation and reasoning, and their interpretation is\nassured by the proportionality that, according to CPI, must hold among\ncauses, considered as a whole, and the sensations they effect,\nconsidered as a whole.  \nWe said that Shepherd mentions at the beginning of her second book\nthat there might seem to be circularity in her procedure (EASP:\nPreface). The earlier volume argues for the causal principles and\nmaintains that they regulate all speculative and practical belief. The\nsecond essay uses these principles to explain the origin of belief in\nthe existence of the external world, and then claims this belief is\njustified. This might seem to be circular, as if the assumption that\nthe causal principles have instances in the world were used to prove\nthe existence of the external world which was taken to prove the\nassumption. But Shepherd maintains her procedure is not circular. She\nexplains that the “justness” of these beliefs could not be\nfully established before it was shown that all sensations whatsoever\nare believed to be successive effects of various causes:  \nthe relation of cause and effect when fully known and established,\naffords the only method of proof in our power, for the knowledge of\nexternal existence. (EASP: xiv–xv)  \nThis is the business of EASP, to show that belief of the causal\nprinciples generates a system of beliefs about the external world\nwhich is justified by merits conferred on the system as a whole. These\nare not, or need not be, merits in relation to truth. The text makes\nno attempt to provide a reason to think the causal principles which\nfound the system are metaphysically necessary truths about what\nexists. We saw that she does not mean to say that God is bound by it.\nThe veracity of God is not offered as warrant of the metaphysical\ntruth of CP; indeed, the existence of God is proved by it (EASP: 150;\nEPEU: 348).  \nThis is the justificatory argument as interpreted in this\n article.[8]\n We assume the causal principles are true of whatever suddenly appears\nto exist; to do otherwise would be to contradict what we are naturally\ninclined to believe.  This is psychologically impossible but\nepistemically unwarranted. We need only this natural inclination and\nthe series of sensations arising and perishing in consciousness to\nform beliefs with regard to the continued, external, and independent\nexistence of objects perceived by sense. Causal reasoning provides an\naccessible reason to assent to these beliefs; so the system comprises\nexistential beliefs that come up to the standard of rationality\nShepherd endorses. In addition, causal reasoning about the existence\nof objects of various kinds provides opportunity to assemble evidence\nwhich makes it highly probable that human beings other than oneself\nexist and objects such as apples and fires exist. As it happens, the\nopportunity has been largely realized in our experience so far. This\nenables us to make reasonable predictions about the qualities that\nthings of various kinds will exhibit on the basis of observing only a\nfew of their qualities. This has the considerable merit of allowing us\nto plan and act with reasonable confidence. Causal inference also\nproduces and provides reason for belief in an almighty deity and the\ncomforts that brings.  These advantages justify beliefs produced by\nthe natural, practically unavoidable assumption of CP and CPI. These\nadvantages are all the more striking in view of fact that Hume’s\ntheory of belief in the external world has none of them and the\nepistemologies of Reid, Brown, and Stewart lack at least one of them.\n","contact.mail":"mbolton@rci.rutgers.edu","contact.domain":"rci.rutgers.edu"}]
