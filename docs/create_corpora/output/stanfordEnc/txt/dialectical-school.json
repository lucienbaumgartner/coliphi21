Its two best-known members, Diodorus Cronus\nand Philo the Logician, made groundbreaking contributions to the\ndevelopment of theories of conditionals and modal logic. Philo\nintroduced a version of material implication; Diodorus devised a\nforerunner of strict implication. Each developed a system of modal\nnotions that satisfies the basic logical requirements laid down by\nmodern standard modal theories. In antiquity, Diodorus Cronus was\nfamous for his so-called Master Argument, which aims to prove that only\nthe actual is possible.\n\n\n\nThe name ‘Dialectical school’ is used for a group of\nphilosophers active from the later 4th to the mid\n3rd centuries BC who are referred to as members of the\nDialectic sect (hairesis) or as dialecticians\n(dialektikoi) in some later ancient sources (Diogenes Laertius\n[DL] 1.19). They were traditionally counted among the philosophers of\nthe Megaric school (founded by Euclides of Megara, author of\nSocratic dialogues ), but may have formed an independent branch of this\nsect. Together with the Megarics, Cyrenaics and Cynics they count\namong the minor Socratic schools. Their main philosophical interest was\nin dialectical skill and accomplishment, including the development and\nresolution of logical paradoxes. They also made several important\npositive contributions to the development of propositional logic. It is\nuncertain whether the members of the Dialectical school were connected\nby an institution comparable to other ancient philosophical schools, or\nwhether their union under one name in later reports was based more\nloosely on their common philosophical interest in dialectic. \n\nHere is a rough chronological list of the members of the Dialectical\nschool. Clinomachus of Thurii, a pupil of Eubulides of Miletus, is\nnamed as founder of the sect, but may have been given this title only\nin hindsight (DL 1.19 and 2.112, Sedley 1977 n.16). Euphantus of\nOlyntus, another pupil of Eubulides, probably born before 349 BC, may\nhave been the earliest member of the sect. The name ‘Dialectical\nschool’ is reported to have been introduced by its member\nDionysius of Chalcedon, active around 320 BC. The most important\nphilosopher of the sect is Diodorus Cronus, who taught in Athens and\nAlexandria around 315-284 BC. He left no writings. His most famous\npupil is Zeno of Citium, founder of the Stoa. The dialectician\nAristides belongs to the same generation as Diodorus Cronus. Alexinus\n(c. 339-265) may have belonged to the sect. The second important\nphilosopher of the dialectical school is the logician Philo (sometimes\nreferred to as Philo of Megara, although we do not know his city of\norigin); he studied with Diodorus. He wrote a dialogue\nMenexenos and possibly was the author of a work On\nSigns and a work On Schemata. All of these are lost.\nDiodorus Cronus’ five daughters Menexene, Argeia, Theognis,\nArtemisia and Pantacleia are all said to have been logicians, and thus\nmay have belonged to the school. Finally, the dialectician Panthoides\nflourished c.280-275 BC, and the dialecticians Aristoteles and\nArtemidorus can be dated around 250 BC. \n\nOriginal philosophical contributions are testified only for Diodorus\nCronus and Philo, in the areas of logic, language and theory of motion\n(for Diodorus' contributions in the latter two areas see entry\nDiodorus Cronus); their views on logic were influential on\nStoic logic, which in turn anticipated many of the developments in\n20th century logic. Philosophers of the Dialectic sect had\nan impact also on Epicurean, Peripatetic, and Sceptic philosophy, and\nseem to have interacted in discussion with members of most Hellenistic\nphilosophical schools. Diodorus Cronus’ modal theory and his\nMaster Argument served as a major philosophical inspiration for\nArthur Prior. \n\nAll we know about the so-called founder of the so-called Dialectical\nschool, Clinomachus of Thurii, is that he was the first who wrote about\npredicates (katêgorêmata) and propositions\n(axiômata) and the like (DL 2.112). Our evidence for\nDiodorus and Philo confirms that they, too, conceived of logic as a\nlogic of propositions. It was the Stoics who systematically developed a\nlogic of propositions and devised subtle classifications of predicates.\n(By contrast, Aristotle's logic had been a logic of terms, where\nsubject and predicate terms were in principle interchangeable.) The\nlogic of the Dialectical school thus was a precursor of Stoic\nlogic. \n\nAt the time of Diodorus and Philo a distinction between simple and\nnon-simple propositions was in circulation among the minor Greek\nSocratic philosophical sects (DL 2.139). Simple propositions were\ndivided into affirmations and negations (ibid.). Among\nnon-simple propositions, which were thought to be composed of simple\nones, conditionals, disjunctions and conjunctions were distinguished.\nDisjunctions or conditionals featured as premises in many of the\nlogical paradoxes and sophisms which members of the Dialectical school\ndiscussed. It is likely that Diodorus and Philo examined the\ntruth-conditions of all three kinds of non-simple propositions;\nhowever, we know their views only for the case of the conditional (see\nbelow sect. 3). \n\nTheir treatment of conditionals and modalities implies that —\nlike most Hellenistic philosophers — Diodorus and Philo worked\nwith a concept of proposition that differs from ours in that it allows\ntruth-values to change over time. For instance, the standard example\nfor a simple proposition, ‘It is day’, does not contain a\ncovert fixed date or definite time determination; rather, it ranges\nover times, changing its truth-value twice daily, all the while\nremaining the same proposition. Thus we may think of propositions as\nthey were understood by Hellenistic philosophers as functions of time.\nDiodorus Cronus can perhaps also be credited with the beginnings of\ntemporal logic, as both his theory of the conditional and his accounts\nof the modalities are built on logically relevant temporal properties\nof propositions (see below sects. 3.2 and 4.2). Moreover, he\ndistinguished between propositions in the present tense like\n‘Helen has three husbands’ and ‘These men are\nmarrying’ and propositions in a tense of completion (the aorist),\n‘Helen had three husbands’ and ‘These men\nmarried’, and observed that it is possible for propositions like\nthe latter two to be true, without there ever having been a time at\nwhich a corresponding one of the former type was true (Sextus Empiricus\n[SE], Against the Physicists 2.97-8). \n\nApart from the various logical puzzles and sophisms, there are only\ntwo topics on which we can be sure of a positive contribution to logic\nby members of the Dialectical school. These are the positions of\nDiodorus and Philo on the theory of conditionals and on modal logic.\nBoth topics involve notorious difficulties and were extensively and\nintensely discussed by Hellenistic logicians; so much so that the\ndisputes became part of the general knowledge of the intelligentsia of\nthe time (SE, Against the Grammarians 309-10). Moreover, the\ntheory of modalities was believed to have far-reaching results for\nother areas of philosophy. \n\nIn the debate about the conditional (sunêmmenon) the\npoint of disagreement concerned the right truth-conditions of a\nconditional (Cicero, Academics II 143). This controversy was\nplayed out against the background of a common acceptance of what counts\nas a conditional, and what its function is. Conditionals were\nunderstood to be non-simple propositions containing one proposition as\nantecedent and one as consequent. The antecedent has the particle\n‘if’ prefixed to it; the standard form is ‘If p,\nq’. A conditional serves to manifest the relation of consequence\n(akolouthia): it announces that its consequent follows from\n(akolouthein) its antecedent (Sextus Empiricus, Against\nthe Logicians 2.110-112). This relation of consequence was also\ncommonly taken to manifest the relation between premises and conclusion\nin a valid argument. \n\nPhilo's criterion for the truth of a conditional is\ntruth-functional. Later in antiquity, it was generally accepted as a\nminimal condition for the truth of a conditional. Philo maintained that\na conditional is false when and only when its antecedent is true and\nits consequent false, and true in the three remaining cases: whenever\nthe antecedent is false, and when both antecedent and consequent are\ntrue (SE, Against the Logicians 2.113-114). Thus this notion\nof a conditional comes very close to that of modern material\nimplication. (It is not the same, since truth for Hellenistic\nphilosophers is relativized to times.) Philo's suggestion is remarkable\nin that it deviates noticeably from the ordinary language understanding\nof conditional sentences and requires abstraction on the basis of a\nconcept of truth-functionality. \n\nRemarkable as it is, Philo's view has the following two drawbacks:\nFirst, as in the case of material implication, for the truth of the\nconditional no connection of content between antecedent and consequent\nis required. Thus, for example, during the day ‘If virtue\nbenefits, it is day’ is Philonian true. This introduces a variant\nof the so-called ‘paradoxes of material implication’\n(Relevance Logic, Conditionals 2.3; Lemmon 59-60,\n82). The presentation of Philo's view in our sources shows that the\nancients were aware of this problem (SE, ibid. 113-117).\nSecond, due to the time-dependency of Hellenistic propositions, Philo's\ncriterion implies that conditionals can change their truth-value over\ntime: for instance, ‘If it is day, it is night’ is true at\nnight, but false during the day. This is counter-intuitive as regards\nthe ordinary use of if-sentences. Moreover, as the concept of a\nconditional was also meant to provide for logical consequence between\npremises and conclusion, this leads to the problematic result that\narguments can in principle change from being valid to being invalid and\nvice versa. \n\nFor Diodorus, a conditional proposition is true if it neither was\nnor is possible that its antecedent is true and its consequent false\n(SE, Against the Logicians 2.115-117). The reference to time\nin this account (‘was … is possible’) suggests that\nthe possibility of a truth-value change left open by Philo's\ntruth-condition was one of the factors to be improved on. \n\nWe do not know whether Diodorus had his own modal notions in mind\nwhen talking about possibility in his criterion, or just some\npre-technical, general concept of possibility, or whether he perhaps\nintended to cover both (Denyer 1981, 39-41; Sedley 1977, 101-2). (The\nverb used here for being possible, endechesthai differs from\nthe word used for possibility in Diodorus' modal theory, which is\ndunaton.) If one assumes that he had his own modal notions in\nview when giving this account (see sect. 4.2 below), his\ntruth-criterion for the conditional stands in the following relation to\nPhilo's: a conditional is Diodorean true now if and only if it is\nPhilonian true at all times. Diodorus has, as it were, quantified the\nPhilonian criterion over time. The conditional ‘If I walk, I\nmove’ is now true because at no time is the antecedent true and\nthe consequent false. Thus for Diodorus, a conditional cannot change\nits truth-value. If it is true (false) at one time, it is true (false)\nat all times. If on the other hand one assumes that Diodorus had some\nunspecified general notion of possibility in mind when producing his\naccount, the criterion will be correspondingly less specific. However,\nit would presumably still be a minimal requirement that it is never the\ncase that the antecedent is true and the consequent false. \n\nDiodorus' criterion bears some resemblance to the modern concept of\nstrict implication. In particular, it shares some of its disadvantages\nin that we encounter a parallel to the ‘paradoxes of strict\nimplication’ (Relevance Logic, Lemmon, 153-4). As in\nPhilo's case, no connection of content is required between antecedent\nand consequent. This time, whenever either the antecedent is impossible\nor the consequent necessary, the conditional will be true, regardless\nof whether there is any relevant connection between the two constituent\npropositions. So for instance ‘If the earth flies, Axiothea\nphilosophizes’ would be true for Diodorus, since the antecedent\nwas considered impossible (DL 7.75). One example given of a\nDiodorean-true conditional, ‘If it is not the case that there are\nindivisible elements of things, then there are indivisible elements of\nthings’ (SE, Outlines of Pyrrhonism 2.111), suggests\nthat there was some awareness of these paradoxes in antiquity. In any\nevent, the Stoic Chrysippus developed a system of relevance\nlogic in which neither the ‘paradoxes of material\nimplication’ nor the ‘paradoxes of strict\nimplication’ occur. \n\nModal logic is the second topic where we have evidence about the\npositions of Philo and Diodorus and their influence on the Stoics\n(Kneale and Kneale 1962, 117-28; Bobzien 1993). Although the modalities\nwere generally discussed under the heading of ‘On things\npossible’, the Hellenistic modal systems were each built on a set\nof four modalities: possibility, impossibility, necessity and\nnon-necessity. The matter of dispute was which system was the right\none; that is, which one adequately described the modalities inherent in\nthe world. In connection with this, an extra-logical concern provided\nadditional fuel to the debate: the belief that if propositions stating\nfuture events that will not happen all turn out to be impossible, the\nfreedom and choices of individuals would be curtailed. This is a\nvariation on the problem of logical determinism which is known from\nAristotle's On Interpretation 9. Several of the sophisms\ndevised and discussed by the Dialectical school touch upon this issue\n— the Mower Argument, the Lazy Argument (Bobzien 1998, 78-81,\n180-233), and the Master Argument. \n\nFor Diodorus and Philo, as for the Stoics the modalities were\nprimarily considered as properties of propositions or states\nof affairs. There is no discussion of modal propositions, i.e. of\npropositions that contain modal operators, such as ‘It is\npossible that it is day’ or ‘It is necessary that virtue\nbenefits’, nor of iterated modalities. \n\nPhilo's view on possibility has survived in several other sources\n(Alexander, On Aristotle's Prior Analytics 184; Philoponus,\nOn Aristotle's Prior Analytics 169) but only in one are his\naccounts of all four modal notions reported: \n\nSo according to Boethius the basic feature of Philonian modalities\nis some intrinsic capability of the propositions to be or not to be\ntrue or false. That this feature is intrinsic is plain from the phrases\n‘by its own nature’ and ‘in itself’. In one\nsource, both phrases are used to characterize Philonian possibility\n(Simplicius, On Aristotle's Categories 195); hence\nboth phrases may have originally applied to all four accounts. \n\nIn all sources the concept of possibility stands out, and so it\nseems likely that Philo built his set of modal notions on a concept of\ninternal consistency, as given in his account of possibility. Philo's\nmodal concepts are thus defined by resort to another, perhaps more\nbasic, modal concept. As to the kind of consistency Philo had in mind,\nwe learn nothing more. Notwithstanding this, there can be little doubt\nthat Philo's modal concepts satisfy a number of basic requirements\nwhich normal systems of modern modal logic tend to satisfy, too. (I\nassume here that Philo accepted the principle of bivalence, as we have\nno contrary information.) These requirements are: \n\nAccording to Philo's accounts, a proposition that is not capable of\nfalsehood must be true; one that is true must be capable of being true;\netc. \n\nThis can be directly read off the definitions. \n\nThis holds for Philo's accounts, if one neglects the difference in\nthe two phrases ‘in itself’ and ‘by its own\nnature’ or assumes that originally both were part of all the\ndefinitions. Then a proposition is not capable of being false precisely\nif its contradictory is not capable of being true, etc. \n\nIn Philo's system this amounts to the fact that every proposition is\neither incapable of falsehood, or incapable of truth, or capable of\nboth. The fact that Philo's modal accounts — and those of\nDiodorus and the Stoics — satisfy these four requirements is of\ncourse no proof that the ancients consciously reflected upon all of\nthem or regarded them all as principles with which their modal theories\nhad to comply. \n\nWe know a little more about Diodorus' modal theory (in addition to\nthe passages cited for Philo, see Epictetus, Dissertations\n2.19, Cicero, On Fate 12, 13, 17; Plutarch, Stoic\nRefutations 1055e-f). Still, again only one text reports all four\ndefinitions of Diodorus' modal notions: \n\nTwo of these modal accounts are disjunctions, the other two are\nconjunctions. Provided that Diodorus accepted the principle of\nbivalence, these definitions, too, satisfy the modal requirements (i)\nto (iv) above, as can be checked easily. \n\nApart from that, Diodorus' modalities are of a very different kind\nfrom Philo's. There is no modal expression hidden anywhere in his\naccounts. Instead, which Diodorean modality a proposition has depends\nwholly on the range of truth-values it has at present and in the\nfuture. For example, if a proposition is always true from now on, it is\nnow both necessary and possible; if it is, from now on, sometimes true\nbut not always, it is possible, but not necessary. Hence it is not the\ncase — as is sometimes assumed — that for Diodorus, every\nproposition is either necessary (and possible) or impossible (and\nnon-necessary). There are propositions that are contingent in the sense\nof being both possible and non-necessary, namely all those which will\nchange their truth-value at some future time. The proposition ‘It\nis day’ is such a case. \n\nThe dependency of Diodorus' modal notions on the propositions’\ntruth-values-at-times implies that some propositions can change their\nmodality from possible to impossible and from non-necessary to\nnecessary. For instance, if we assume that the proposition\n‘Artemisia is five years old’ is now true, then that\nproposition is now possible; but it will presumably be impossible at\nsome future time, namely once Artemisia has reached the age of six,\nsince from then on it will never be true again (assuming linearity of\ntime). \n\nWe do not know what motivated Diodorus to introduce his modal\n notions.[1]\n But we know that Hellenistic philosophers\ngenerally regarded Diodorus' modal notions as jeopardizing freedom\n— a since they rule out the possibility that something that never\nhappens, or is never true, is nonetheless possible. Thus, if ‘Dio\ngoes to Corinth’ is and will be false, then ‘Dio goes to\nCorinth’ is impossible, and then, or so the thought went, it is\nimpossible for Dio to go to Corinth. In this context it becomes plain\nwhy our sources stress the fact that something can be Philonian\npossible without ever being true or obtaining.This is the relevant\ndifference from Diodorus with respect to logical determinism, the point\nbeing that Philo's modalities, unlike Diodorus’, do not unduly\nlimit the scope of contingency. \n\nDiodorus’ definition of that which is possible can be split\ninto two distinct claims: first that everything that either is or will\nbe true is possible, and second, that everything that is possible\neither is or will be true. The first statement was not questioned by\nHellenistic philosophers. It is the second statement that was and is\nconsidered counterintuitive and in need of justification; it is this\nclaim which Diodorus attempted to back up with his Master Argument\n(Alexander, On Aristotle's Prior Analytics 183.34-184.6;\nEpictetus, Dissertations 2.19). \n\nDespite being widely known in antiquity, the argument has not come\ndown to us; all we have is one brief passage: \n\nThis is usually understood as implying that the argument was\ngrounded on statements (I) and (II), and had (IV), which is the\ncontradictory of (III), as conclusion; and this is about as far as the\npassages lead us. But how did the argument run? A viable reconstruction\nhas to satisfy a number of more or less trivial conditions. It must\nmake use of the principles (I) and (II) handed down in Epictetus; in\naddition to these, it must make use solely of premises plausible to the\nStoics; and it must appear valid. For we know that different Stoic\nphilosophers attempted to refute (I) or (II), but we do not hear of\nanyone questioning the truth of any other premise or the validity of\nthe argument. Moreover, the reconstruction must employ only the logical\nmeans and concepts available in antiquity; in particular the notions of\nproposition, consequence, and modalities used must fit in with the\nlogic of the time, and it must be possible to formulate the argument in\nordinary language. Finally, the restored argument should not have a\ncomplexity which precludes its presentation at a social gathering,\nsince it appears that people enjoyed discussing the Master argument\nover dinner (Epictetus, Dissertations. 2.19.8). \n\nThe following is an informal reconstruction of the Master Argument\nwhich has the advantage of being historically credible and in keeping\nwith the above constraints. (A version of this type of reconstruction\nwas first presented by Arthur Prior (Prior 1955).) The\nEpictetus passage suggests that the argument was presented in terms of\npropositions and their modalities, and so will the reconstruction.\nOther sources present Diodorus' modalities as modalities of states of\naffairs, and alternative versions of the Master argument can be\nproduced accordingly. (The difference between propositions and states\nof affairs is often blurred in ancient testimonies of logic.) \n\nIn line with Diodorus’ modal definition, the general\nconclusion of the argument (IV) may be reformulated as \n\nThe first statement is less clear. It runs \n\nThe Greek term used for ‘past’\n(parelêluthos) is a standard Stoic expression for past\npropositions, meaning not that the proposition itself subsisted in the\npast, but that it is in some sense about the past. The principle occurs\nalso in Cicero, together with some explication: \n\nFrom this passage we may infer that it was a peculiarity of all past\ntrue propositions that they cannot change their truth-value to\nfalsehood; and that because of this they are necessary. This suggests\nthat the past true propositions at issue do not include all\npropositions in the past tense, but that they were those propositions\nwhich correspond to some past state or event. For instance, the true\npast proposition ‘I went to Athens’ corresponds to the\nevent of my having gone to Athens. It can never become false, once it\nis true. Assume that I went to Athens last month. Then the proposition\n‘I went to Athens’ is not only true now, it will also be\ntrue tomorrow, the day after, and in fact always from now on. The truth\nof the proposition is based on the fact that there has been a case of\nmy going to Athens, and — whatever happens from now on —\nthis cannot unhappen. (One can bring out this feature more clearly by\nreformulating the proposition as ‘It has been the case that I\nwent to Athens’). On the other hand, the proposition ‘You\nhave not been to Athens’ does not correspond to a past state or\nevent. Suppose that up to now you never went to Athens. Then the\nproposition is true now. Now suppose in addition that you will go to\nAthens next week. After you have gone there, the proposition ‘You\nhave not been to Athens’ is no longer true. Hence it is not\nnecessary now. (This proposition cannot be correctly paraphrased as\n‘It has been the case that you were not in Athens’). We may\nhence reformulate statement (I) as \n\nThe second statement that functions as a premise in the argument\nis \n\nThis was accepted by Aristotle and, with the exception of\nChrysippus, by all Hellenistic logicians. At least by the Stoics it was\nunderstood as \n\nThis amounts to the statement that if a proposition is impossible\nand follows from some other proposition, then this other proposition is\nimpossible, too. \n\nThe following reconstruction assumes that, in addition to (I) and\n(II), the argument rests on a couple of further principles, which might\nhave been generally taken to be valid and thus not worth mentioning, or\nelse which might have been generally accepted by the Stoics and for\nthis reason omitted by Epictetus. The first additional principle is \n\nFor instance, if I am in Athens now, then it has always in the past\nbeen the case that I would be in Athens (at some time). This principle\ngains historical plausibility from the fact that we find a version of\nit in Aristotle (On Interpretation 9, 18b9-11), and that\nanother version of it was accepted by the Stoics (Cicero, On\nDivination 1.125). The second additional principle is \n\nThis statement is based on the idea that if a proposition presently\nneither is nor will be true, and you step back in time, as it were,\nthen the formerly present ‘not being true’ turns into a\nfuture ‘not going to be true’, so that from the point of\nview of the past, the proposition will never be true, and the\ncorresponding state of affairs will never be the case. (This is assumed\nto hold at least for the past moment that immediately precedes the\npresent.) This principle has some plausibility to it. There is some\nevidence that it may have been discussed in antiquity (Becker 1961,\n253-5). \n\nNext the construction of the argument: Fallacies and sophisms were\ngenerally presented by means of an example which stands in for the\ngeneral case, and it is plausible that this was so for the Master\nArgument as well. Overall, the argumentation then proceeded as follows:\nyou assume of a chosen proposition that it neither is nor will be true;\nnext, by employing (I), (II), (V) and (VI), you deduce that this\nproposition is impossible. Then you generalize the result to all\npropositions, since nothing in the argument hinges on the fact that\nthis particular proposition was selected. A suitable example can be\nfound in Alexander's passage on Diodorus' notion of possibility and the\nMaster Argument: the proposition ‘I am in Corinth.’ The\nargument then starts with the assumption that \n\nThe conclusion to be demonstrated is that \n\nBy (VI) it follows from (1) that \n\nBy (I) (‘all past truths are necessary’), it follows\nfrom (2) that \n\nBut since necessity of a proposition is equivalent to the\nimpossibility of its contradictory (modal requirement (iii) above),\nfrom (3) it follows that \n\nNow, according to (V), it holds that \n\nThis is equivalent to \n\nNow we can apply (II) (‘the impossible follows from the\nimpossible’) to (4) and (5′), and obtain as a result\nthat \n\nAnd this is precisely what the Master argument was meant to show.\nMoreover, this argument appears to be valid. \n\nWhere does the argument go wrong? The ancients went in for\ncriticizing (I) and (II), and one may indeed wonder whether (I) covers\ncases of the kind to which it has been applied above. But there are\nalso a couple of things questionable with (V) and (VI). With a certain\ncontinuum theory of time, it turns out that (VI) does not hold for\nthose — few — cases in which the proposition at issue has\nstarted to be false only at the present moment (Denyer 1981, 43 and\n45). More importantly, (V) and its variants seem to smuggle in a\ndeterministic assumption. On one or another of these grounds, then, one\nmay attempt to hold the Master Argument unsound, and so to reject\nDiodorus' own account of the possible as what either is or will be\ntrue.","contact.mail":"susanne.bobzien@all-souls.ox.ac.uk","contact.domain":"all-souls.ox.ac.uk"}]
