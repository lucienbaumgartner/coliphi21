This work is in two parts,\npreceded by a long introduction in which Kant explains and defends the\nwork's importance in his critical system overall: in the first part,\nthe “Critique of Aesthetic Judgment,” Kant discusses\naesthetic experience and judgment, in particular of the beautiful and\nthe sublime, and also artistic creation; in the second part, the\n“Critique of Teleological Judgment,” he discusses the role\nof teleology (that is, appeal to ends, purposes or goals) in natural\nscience and in our understanding of nature more generally.\nThe Critique of Judgment was the third and last of Kant's\nthree Critiques, the other two being the Critique of Pure\nReason (1781, with a second edition in 1787), which deals with\nmetaphysics and epistemology, and the Critique of Practical\nReason of 1788, which, alongside his Groundwork of the\nMetaphysics of Morals of 1785, deals with ethics.\n\n The Critique of Judgment has received less attention than\nthe other two Critiques.  One reason is that the areas of\naesthetics and natural teleology have traditionally been considered\nless philosophically central than those of ethics, metaphysics and\nepistemology.  Another is that it raises an interpretive problem which\nhas no analogue in the case of the other Critiques: that is,\nhow to make sense of the work as a whole given the seeming disparity\nof the two parts, not only with each other, but also with the\n“faculty of judgment” which is the work's ostensible focus.\nHowever, Kant's aesthetic theory has always been extremely influential\nwithin philosophical aesthetics and the philosophy of art, and since\nthe late 1970s there has been a rapidly expanding literature on Kant's\naesthetics within Anglo-American Kant interpretation.  Kant's views on\nnatural teleology, very much neglected in comparison to his\naesthetics, started to receive more attention in the early 1990s, and\nthere has been greatly increased interest, during the last ten years\nin particular, both in Kant's view of teleology in its own right, and\nin its potential relevance to contemporary philosophy of biology.\nMoreover, over the last twenty years or so, more attention has been\ndirected towards the project of interpreting the Critique of\nJudgment as a coherent whole.  With increased focus on its\ngeneral philosophical underpinnings, it has come to be seen not only\nas significant within the disciplines of aesthetics and philosophy of\nbiology, but also as playing an important systematic role with respect\nto Kant's epistemology, metaphysics and ethics, and indeed, as\nrelevant to contemporary discussions in these, and related, areas.\n\n\nKant's aesthetics and teleology together comprise a very wide field,\nand this article cannot cover all the relevant topics, nor take\naccount of all the relevant literature.  Three limitations should be\nmentioned.  First, although Kant wrote on aesthetics and teleology\nthroughout his career, this article considers only Kant's Critique\nof Judgment (along with the so-called “First\nIntroduction,” an earlier version of the Introduction which was\nnot published during Kant's lifetime but which is included with the\nmost recent English translations of the Critique of\nJudgment).  Second, this article is concerned primarily with the\ninterpretive and philosophical issues raised by Kant's writings on\nthese topics, as opposed to historical questions regarding their\norigin and reception.  Third, the article focusses primarily on those\nissues which have attracted most attention in the Anglo-American\nanalytic tradition; this is reflected in the bibliography, which is\nprimarily restricted to works in English, and more specifically from\nan analytic perspective. For some references to Kant's writings on\naesthetics and teleology other than the Critique of Judgment,\nsee under Primary Sources in\nthe Bibliography.  Some suggestions for secondary\nliterature dealing with the history and reception of Kant's aesthetics\nand teleology, and for secondary literature in English from a less\nanalytic perspective, are given under Secondary\nSources in the Bibliography.\n\n\nKant's account of aesthetics and teleology is ostensibly part of a\nbroader discussion of the faculty or power of judgment\n[Urteilskraft], which is the faculty “for thinking the\nparticular under the universal” (Introduction IV,\n5:179). Although the Critique of Pure Reason includes some\ndiscussion of the faculty of judgment, defined as “the capacity\nto subsume under rules, that is, to distinguish whether something\nfalls under a given rule” (krV A132/B171), it is not until\nthe Critique of Judgment that he treats judgment as a\nfull-fledged faculty in its own right, with its own a priori\nprinciple, and, accordingly, requiring a “critique” to\ndetermine its scope and limits.  Judgment in the Critique of Judgment is described as\nhaving two roles or aspects, “determining”\n[bestimmend] and “reflecting”\n[reflektierend] (Introduction IV, 5:179 and FI V,\n20:211). Judgment in its determining role subsumes given particulars\nunder concepts or universals which are themselves already given. This\nrole coincides with the role assigned to the faculty of judgment in\nthe Critique of Pure Reason; it also appears to correspond to\nthe activity of imagination in its “schematism” of\nconcepts. Judgment in this role does not operate as an independent\nfaculty, but is instead governed by principles of the\nunderstanding. The more distinctive role assigned to judgment in\nthe Critique of Judgment is the reflecting role, that of\n“finding” the universal for the given particular\n(Introduction IV, 5:179).  Kant's recognition of judgment as a faculty\nin its own right, and hence of the need for a Critique not\njust for theoretical and practical reason but also for judgment,\nappears to be connected with his ascription to judgment of a\nreflecting, in addition to a merely determining, role. \nJudgment as reflecting, or reflective judgment [reflektierende\nUrteilskraft], is assigned various different roles within Kant's\nsystem. It is described as responsible for various cognitive tasks\nassociated with empirical scientific enquiry, in particular, the\nclassification of natural things into a hierarchical taxonomy of\ngenera and species, and the construction of systematic explanatory\nscientific theories. Kant also suggests that it has a more fundamental\nrole to play in making cognition possible, in particular that it\nenables us to regard nature as empirically lawlike (see especially\nIntroduction V, 5:184), and, even more fundamentally, that it is\nresponsible for the formation of all empirical concepts (see\nespecially FI V, 20:211–213).  But reflective judgment is also described as responsible for two\nspecific kinds of judgments: aesthetic judgments (judgments about the\nbeautiful and the sublime) and teleological judgments (judgments which\nascribe ends or purposes to natural things, or which characterize them\nin purposive or functional terms). These, along with associated\ntopics, are discussed respectively in Section I, the “Critique\nof Aesthetic Judgment, ” and Section II, the “Critique of\nTeleological Judgment. ” The discussion of the role of judgment\nin empirical scientific enquiry is confined to a few sections of the\nIntroduction and First Introduction. \nAlthough reflective judgment is exercised in both aesthetic and\nteleological judgment, Kant assigns a special role to its exercise in\nthe aesthetic case, and specifically in judgments of beauty\n(Introduction VIII, 193; FI XI, 243–244). More specifically, he says,\nit is in judgments of beauty (as opposed to the sublime), and even\nmore specifically, judgments about the beauty of nature (as opposed to\nart), that “judgment reveals itself as a faculty that has its\nown special principle” (FI XI, 244). The especially close\nconnection between judgments of beauty and the faculty of judgment is\nreflected in Kant's view that the feeling of pleasure in a beautiful\nobject is felt in virtue of an exercise of reflective judgment\n(Introduction VII, FI VIII). \nMuch of Kant's aesthetics and theory of teleology is developed without\nany explicit reference to the faculty of judgment, and the\n“Critique of Aesthetic Judgment” makes no mention of the\nrole of reflective judgment in empirical scientific enquiry (in fact,\nthe term “reflective judgment” does not figure in the\n“Critique of Aesthetic Judgment” at all).  The only\nsuggestion in the “Critique of Aesthetic Judgment” of an\nimportant role for the faculty of judgment in Kant's aesthetics is in\nthe Deduction of Taste, where he describes the principle of taste as\nthe “subjective principle of judgment in general”\n(§35, 286) and suggests that the relation of aesthetic judgment\nspecifically to the faculty of judgment in general is crucial for the\nlegitimacy of judgments of beauty (§38, 290).  But it is possible\non the face of it to make sense of Kant's analysis of judgments of\nbeauty, and of his argument for their legitimacy, without appeal to\nthe account of the faculty of judgment offered in the Introductions to\nthe Critique of Judgment.  Accordingly much of the secondary\nliterature on Kant's aesthetics has treated it in isolation from the\nmore general account of judgment in which it is embedded, and the same\nis true, perhaps to an even greater extent, in the case of Kant's\nteleology.  Conversely, discussions of Kant's “theory of\njudgment” have typically taken little or no account of Kant's\ntreatment of judgment in the third Critique, suggesting\nthereby that Kant's views on judgment are exhausted by his account of\ncognitive (in particular non-aesthetic) judgments in the Critique\nof Pure Reason and the Logic.  (The article\n“Kant's Theory of\nJudgment” in the present Encyclopedia (Hanna 2009) is one\nrecent example.) \nHowever, recent interest in the systematic role of the Critique of\nJudgment in Kant's philosophy overall has resulted in increased\nattention to the notion of judgment in the third Critique,\nand specifically to the question of its bearing on Kant's theory of\njudgment in the Critique of Pure Reason and\nthe Logic.  Bell (1987) and Ginsborg (1990) both argue for\nthe centrality of the third Critique's notion of judgment in\nKant's theory of cognitive judgments in the first Critique.\nThe importance of the third Critique's notion of judgment for\nKant's account of cognition is also highlighted in Béatrice\nLonguenesse's important 1998 study of the “capacity to\njudge” in the first Critique.  Longuenesse maintains\nthat there is a close connection between the “capacity to\njudge” [Vermögen zu urteilen] in that work and the\nfaculty of judgment in the Critique of Judgment, a connection\nwhich she summarizes by describing the faculty of judgment as the\n“actualization” of the capacity to judge in relation to\nsensory perceptions (1998, 8).  According to Longuenesse, the activity\nof reflective judgment corresponds to the “comparison,\nreflection and abstraction” which Kant describes in\nthe Logic (§6, 9:94–95) as responsible for the\nformation of empirical concepts, and which she understands as, in\nturn, a necessary condition of the application of the pure concepts of\nunderstanding to the manifold of sensible intuition (1998,\n163–166 and 195–197).  Longuenesse's view on this point is\nendorsed and elaborated in Allison (2001, ch. 1); for criticism, and\nan alternative approach, see Ginsborg (2006). \nIn addition to its potential significance for Kant's theory of\ncognition, the notion of judgment in the third Critique is\nalso important for addressing the interpretive problem of the unity of\nthe Critique of Judgment, in particular, the question of why\nKant addresses aesthetics and teleology together in a single work.\nMany commentators have been skeptical that Kant draws any real\nphilosophical connection between the two areas; see for example\nSchopenhauer (1969, vol. I, p. 531), Marc-Wogau (1938, p. 34n.), and\nBeck (1969, 497).  But recently there have been increasing attempts to\nunderstand Kant's views on aesthetics and his views on biological\nteleology as aspects of a unified philosophical project.  Proposals\nfor connecting Kant's views on aesthetics with his views on natural\nteleology can be found, for example, in Zumbach (1984, pp. 51–53),\nMakkreel (1990, ch. 5), Aquila (1991), and Ginsborg (1997a).; by far\nthe most developed account is to be found in Zuckert (2007).  For more\non the question of the unity of the Critique of Judgment, see\nunder 3.1 and 3.2 below. \nAn aesthetic judgment, in Kant's usage, is a judgment which is based\non feeling, and in particular on the feeling of pleasure or\ndispleasure. According to Kant's official view there are three kinds\nof aesthetic judgment: judgments of the agreeable, judgments of beauty\n(or, equivalently, judgments of taste), and judgments of the\nsublime. However, Kant often uses the expression “aesthetic\njudgment” in a narrower sense which excludes judgments of the\nagreeable, and it is with aesthetic judgments in this narrower sense\nthat the “Critique of Aesthetic Judgment” is primarily\nconcerned. Such judgments can either be, or fail to be,\n“pure”; while Kant mostly focusses on the ones which are\npure, there are reasons to think that most judgments about art (as\nopposed to nature) do not count as pure, so that it is important to\nunderstand Kant's views on such judgments as well. \nThe “Critique of Aesthetic Judgment” is concerned not only\nwith judgments of the beautiful and the sublime, but also with the\nproduction of objects about which such judgments are appropriately\nmade; this topic is discussed under the headings of “fine\nart” or “beautiful art” [schöne Kunst]\nand “genius.” \nThe most distinctive part of Kant's aesthetic theory, and the part\nwhich has aroused most interest among commentators, is his account of\njudgments of beauty, and, more specifically, pure judgments of\nbeauty. (Following Kant's usage, the expression “judgment of\nbeauty” without qualification will refer, in what follows, to\npure judgments of beauty.) The most important elements of this account\nare sketched here in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, and which correspond\nroughly to the “Analytic of the Beautiful” and the\n“Deduction of Pure Aesthetic Judgments”\nrespectively. Sections 2.3 and 2.4 are concerned, respectively, with\ninterpretative issues that have arisen in connection with the account,\nand with criticisms which have been made of it. \nOther elements of Kant's theory are sketched in the remainder of the\nsection. Section 2.5 is concerned with judgments of beauty that are\nnot pure, in particular judgments of “adherent” as opposed\nto “free” beauty; Section 2.6 with beautiful art and\ngenius; Section 2.7 with judgments of the sublime; Section 2.8 with\nthe relation between aesthetics and morality; and Section 2.9 with\nother implications of Kant's aesthetic theory. \nThe first section of the “Critique of Aesthetic Judgment”,\nthe “Analytic of the Beautiful,” aims to analyse the\nnotion of a judgment of beauty or judgment of taste, describing the\nfeatures which distinguish judgments of beauty from judgments of other\nkinds, notably cognitive judgments (which include judgments ascribing\ngoodness to things), and what he calls “judgments of the\nagreeable.” Kant is not explicit about the pretheoretical\nconception of judgments of beauty which is the subject of his\nanalysis, and there is room for controversy about what does and does\nnot count as a judgment of beauty in Kant's sense.  Not every\npredicative use of the word “beautiful” signals the making\nof a judgment of beauty, at least in the paradigmatic sense with which\nKant is concerned (for a useful discussion, see Savile 1993, ch. 1).\nFor example, at §8 Kant denies that the judgment that roses in\ngeneral are beautiful is a judgment of beauty or judgment of taste\nproper: it is not an “aesthetic” but an\n“aesthetically grounded logical judgment.” There is also\nroom for debate about whether the intuitive notion of a judgment of\nbeauty, for Kant, allows for negative judgments of beauty\n(see 2.3.6 below).  However, at a first\napproximation, we can say that it is the mental activity or content\ntypically expressed by, or manifested in, a sincere utterance of\n“that's beautiful” in reference to a perceptually\npresented object.  Kant analyses the notion of a judgment of beauty by considering it\nunder four headings, or “moments,” as sketched below: \nJudgments of beauty are based on feeling, in particular feelings of\npleasure (Kant also mentions displeasure, but this does not figure\nprominently in his account; for more on this point,\nsee Section 2.3.6 below). The pleasure, however,\nis of a distinctive kind: it is disinterested, which means that it\ndoes not depend on the subject's having a desire for the object, nor\ndoes it generate such a desire. The fact that judgments of beauty are\nbased on feeling rather than “objective sensation” (e.g.,\nthe sensation of a thing's colour) distinguishes them from cognitive\njudgments based on perception (e.g., the judgment that a thing is\ngreen). But the disinterested character of the feeling distinguishes\nthem from other judgments based on feeling. In particular, it\ndistinguishes them from (i) judgments of the agreeable, which are the\nkind of judgment expressed by saying simply that one likes something\nor finds it pleasing (for example, food or drink), and (ii) judgments\nof the good, including judgments both about the moral goodness of\nsomething and about its goodness for particular non-moral\npurposes. \nJudgments of beauty have, or make a claim to,\n“universality” or “universal validity.” (Kant\nalso uses the expression “universal communicability”; this\ncan be taken as equivalent to “universal validity.”) That\nis, in making a judgment of beauty about an object, one takes it that\neveryone else who perceives the object ought also to judge it to be\nbeautiful, and, relatedly, to share one's pleasure in it. But the\nuniversality is not “based on concepts.” That is, one's\nclaim to agreement does not rest on the subsumption of the object\nunder a concept (in the way, for example, that the claim to agreement\nmade by the judgment that something is green rests on the ascription\nto the object of the property of being green, and hence its\nsubsumption under the concept green).  It follows from this\nthat judgments of beauty cannot, despite their universal validity, be\nproved: there are no rules by which someone can be compelled to judge\nthat something is beautiful (Kant expands on this point in\n§§32–33).  More strongly, judgments of beauty are not to be\nunderstood as predicating the concept beauty of their\nobjects: as he puts it later, “beauty is not a concept of the\nobject” (§38, 290).  Still later, in the “Antinomy of\nTaste,” Kant seems to go back on this strong claim by saying\nthat a judgment of beauty rests on an “indeterminate\nconcept” (§57, 341); however, by “concept” here\nhe diverges from the standard use of the term “concept” as\nreferring to a kind of representation which can figure in\ncognition.  The fact that judgments of beauty are universally valid\nconstitutes a further feature (in addition to the disinterestedness of\nthe pleasure on which they are based) distinguishing them from\njudgments of agreeable. For in claiming simply that one likes\nsomething, one does not claim that everyone else ought to like it\ntoo. But the fact that their universal validity is not based on\nconcepts distinguishes judgments of beauty from non-evaluative\ncognitive judgments and judgments of the good, both of which make a\nclaim to universal validity that is based on concepts. \nUnlike judgments of the good, judgments of the beautiful do not\npresuppose an end or purpose [Zweck] which the object is\ntaken to satisfy. (This is closely related to the point that their\nuniversality is not based on concepts). However, they nonetheless\ninvolve the representation of what Kant calls\n“purposiveness” [Zweckmässigkeit]. Because\nthis representation of purposiveness does not involve the ascription\nof an purpose, Kant calls the purposiveness which is represented\n“merely formal purposiveness” or “the form of\npurposiveness.” He describes it as perceived both in the object\nitself and in the activity of imagination and understanding in their\nengagement with the object.  (For more on this activity, see the\ndiscussion of the “free play of the faculties”\nin Section 2.2; for more on the notion of\npurposiveness, see Section 3.1.)  The Third Moment,\nin particular §14, is the main evidence for Kant's supposed\nformalism in aesthetics; for more on Kant's formalism,\nsee Section 2.4. \nJudgments of beauty involve reference to the idea of necessity, in the\nfollowing sense: in taking my judgment of taste to be universally\nvalid, I take it, not that everyone who perceives the\nobject will share my pleasure in it and (relatedly) agree\nwith my judgment, but that everyone ought to do so. I take\nit, then, that my pleasure stands in a “necessary”\nrelation to the object which elicits it, where the necessity here can\nbe described (though Kant himself does not use the term) as\nnormative. But, as in the case of universal validity, the necessity is\nnot based on concepts or rules (at least, not concepts or rules that\nare determinate, that is, of a kind which figure in cognition; as\nnoted earlier in this section, Kant describes it, in the Antinomy of\nTaste, as resting on an “indeterminate concept”). Kant\ncharacterizes the necessity more positively by saying that it is\n“exemplary,” in the sense that one's judgment itself\nserves as an example of how everyone ought to judge (§18, 237).\nHe also says that it is based on a “common sense,” defined\nas a subjective principle which allows us to judge by feeling rather\nthan concepts (§20). \n\nRunning through Kant's various characterizations of judgments of\nbeauty is a basic dichotomy between two apparently opposed sets of\nfeatures. On the one hand, judgments of beauty are based on feeling,\nthey do not depend on subsuming the object under a concept (in\nparticular, the concept of a purpose which such an object is supposed\nto satisfy), and they cannot be proved. This combination of features\nseems to suggest that judgments of beauty should be assimilated to\njudgments of the agreeable. On the other hand, however, judgments of\nbeauty are unlike judgments of the agreeable in not involving desire\nfor the object; more importantly and centrally, they make a normative\nclaim to everyone's agreement. These features seem to suggest that\nthey should be assimilated, instead, to objective cognitive\njudgments. \nIn claiming that judgments of beauty have both sets of features, Kant\ncan be seen as reacting equally against the two main opposing\ntraditions in eighteenth-century aesthetics: the\n“empiricist” tradition of aesthetics represented by Hume,\nHutcheson and Burke, on which a judgment of taste is an expression of\nfeeling without cognitive content, and the “rationalist”\ntradition of aesthetics represented by Baumgarten and Meier, on which\na judgment of taste consists in the cognition of an object as having\nan objective property. Kant's insistence that there is an alternative\nto these two views, one on which judgments of beauty are both based on\nfeeling and make a claim to universal validity, is probably the most\ndistinctive aspect of his aesthetic theory. But this insistence\nconfronts him with the obvious problem of how the two features, or\nsets of features, are to be reconciled. As Kant puts it: “how is\na judgment possible which, merely from one's own feeling of\npleasure in an object, independent of its concept, judges this\npleasure as attached to the representation of the same object in\nevery other subject, and does so a priori, i.e., without\nhaving to wait for the assent of others?” (§36, 288) \nThe argument constituting Kant's official answer to this question (the\n“Deduction of Taste”) is presented in the section entitled\n“Deduction of Pure Aesthetic Judgments,” in particular in\nsections §§31–39, with the core of the argument given at\n§38.  It is also prefigured in the “Analytic of the\nBeautiful,” in particular at §9 and §22, although the\nargument of §22, which appeals to the notion of a “common\nsense”, takes a somewhat different form from the presentation in\nthe “Deduction of Taste” proper.  The argument in all of its appearances relies on the claim,\nintroduced in §9, that pleasure in the beautiful depends on the\n“free play” or “free harmony” of the faculties\nof imagination and understanding. In the Critique of Pure\nReason, imagination is described as “synthesizing the\nmanifold of intuition” under the governance of rules that are\nprescribed by the understanding: the outcome of this is cognitive\nperceptual experience of objects as having specific empirical\nfeatures. The rules prescribed by the understanding, are, or\ncorrespond to, particular concepts which are applied to the\nobject. For example, when a manifold is synthesized in accordance with\nthe concepts green and square, the outcome is a\nperceptual experience in which the object is perceived as green and\nsquare. But now in the Critique of Judgment, Kant suggests\nthat imagination and understanding can stand in a different kind of\nrelationship, one in which imagination's activity harmonizes with the\nunderstanding but without imagination's being constrained or governed\nby understanding. In this relationship, imagination and understanding\nin effect do what is ordinarily involved in the bringing of objects\nunder concepts, and hence in the perception of objects as having\nempirical features: but they do this without bringing the object under\nany concept in particular. So rather than perceiving the object as\ngreen or square, the subject whose faculties are in free play responds\nto it perceptually with a state of mind which is non-conceptual, and\nspecifically a feeling of disinterested pleasure. It is this kind of\npleasure which is the basis for a judgment of taste. \nKant appeals to this account of pleasure in the beautiful in order to\nargue for its universal validity or universal communicability: to\nargue, that is, that a subject who feels such a pleasure, and thus\njudges the object to be beautiful, is entitled to demand that everyone\nelse feel a corresponding pleasure and thus agree with her judgment of\ntaste. For, he claims, the free play of the faculties manifests the\nsubjective condition of cognition in general (see for example §9,\n218; §21, 238; §38, 290). We are entitled to claim that\neveryone ought to agree with our cognitions: for example, if I\nperceptually cognize an object as being green and square, I am\nentitled to claim that everyone else ought to cognize it as green and\nsquare. But in order for this demand for agreement to be possible, he\nsuggests, it must also be possible for me to demand universal\nagreement for the subjective condition of such cognitions. If I can\ntake it that everyone ought to share my cognition of an object as\ngreen or square, then I must also be entitled to take it that everyone\nought to share a perception of the object in which my faculties are in\nfree play, since the free play is no more than a manifestation of what\nis in general required for an object's being cognized as green or\nsquare in the first place. \nThe most serious objection to the argument can be put in the form of a\ndilemma; see for example Guyer (1979, p. 297), Meerbote (1982,\npp. 81ff.) , Allison (2001, pp. 184–192), Rind (2002).  Either the\nfree play of the faculties is involved in all cognitive perceptual\nexperience, or it is not.  If it is, then it would seem,\ncounterintuitively, that every object should be perceived as\nbeautiful.  But if it is not, then the central inference does not seem\nto go through. From the fact that I can demand agreement for the state\nof my faculties in experiencing an object as, say, green or square, it\ndoes not follow that I can demand agreement for a state in which my\nfaculties are in free play, since the possibility of experiencing the\nfree play would seem to require something over and above what is\nrequired for cognition alone.  Most defenders of the argument have grasped the second horn of the\ndilemma.  One such defence, originally proposed by Ameriks in his 1982\n(subsequently incorporated into Ameriks 2003), relies on an\nunderstanding of judgments of taste as objective, and hence as making\na claim to universal agreement which is akin to that made by cognitive\njudgments.  (For more on the objectivity of taste,\nsee Section 2.3.5).  Another, offered by Allison,\nrejects the objection as presupposing an overly strong interpretation\nof what the Deduction is intended to accomplish.  The objection tells\nagainst the Deduction only if it is construed as entitling us to claim\nuniversal agreement for particular judgments of taste; but, as Allison\nreads it, the Deduction is intended only to establish that such claims\ncan, in general, be legitimate (Allison 2001, ch. 8; see especially\n177–179).  A similar position is taken by Kalar (2006, 134).  However,\nsome commentators have taken this kind of defence to be inadequate,\nholding that the argument must establish not only a general\nentitlement to demand agreement for judgments of beauty, but an\nentitlement in each particular case (Savile 1987, Chignell 2007). \nAnother option for defending the argument would be to grasp the first\nhorn, accepting that, on Kant's account, every object can legitimately\nbe judged to be beautiful.  Gracyk (1986) argues, independently of the\nargument of the Deduction, that this is Kant's view, and it might also\nbe noted that, if judgments of beauty are not objective, there can be\nno feature of an object which rules it out as a candidate for being\nlegitimately found beautiful.  However, approaches along these lines\nhave not figured prominently in the literature on the Deduction.  A number of commentators have taken the dilemma, or considerations\nrelated to it, to be fatal to Kant's view that judgments of beauty\nmake a legitimate claim to universal validity: see for example\nMeerbote (1982, cited above) and Guyer (1979), pp. 319–324 (although\nGuyer offers a more positive assessment in his (2003a), p. 60n15).\nOthers have argued that Kant's view can be saved by drawing on\nconsiderations not mentioned in the official argument of the\nDeduction. As noted below (Section 2.8), Kant draws\na close connection between our capacity for aesthetic judgment and our\nnature as moral beings, and even though Kant himself does not appeal\nto this connection in the deduction of taste, some commentators,\nincluding Elliott (1968), Crawford (1974), Kemal (1986) and Savile\n(1987), have taken moral considerations to constitute the ultimate\nground of the legitimacy of judgments of beauty.  Another strategy\ndrawing on considerations outside the Deduction itself is to appeal to\nKant's theory of aesthetic ideas (see Section 2.6),\nwhich is ostensibly part of his theory of art, rather than his core\ntheory of taste.  This strategy is adopted in Savile (1987) and\nChignell (2007); Chignell's view differs from Savile's in that it does\nnot make any appeal to moral considerations.  Finally, some\ncommentators have held that while the argument of the official\nDeduction at §38 is unsuccessful in avoiding the dilemma, the\nversion of the argument offered at §21, which appeals to the\nnotion of a “common sense,” is more effective; see in\nparticular Rind (2002) and Kalar (2006), ch. 5. \nThe assessment of the objection, and of Kant's Deduction of Taste more\ngenerally, is complicated by a number of more fundamental interpretive\nissues, which are discussed in the next section. \nThis section describes six issues which have arisen in connection with\nKant's account of pure judgments of taste, and which are relevant to\nthe assessment of his argument for the possibility of such judgments.\nAlthough these issues are central to understanding the core of Kant's\nview, readers seeking a more general survey of Kant's aesthetics can\nomit this section. \nWhat is the relation between the pleasure which is felt in an object\nexperienced as beautiful, and the judgment that the object is\nbeautiful, that is, the judgment of taste?  Kant describes the\njudgment of taste as “based on” a feeling of pleasure, and\nas claiming that everyone ought to share the subject's feeling of\npleasure, or, as he puts it, as claiming the “universal\ncommunicability” of the pleasure. This seems to imply that the\npleasure is distinct from the act of judging, and more specifically\nthat the pleasure precedes the judging: we first feel pleasure, and\nthen claim, perhaps based on characteristics of the pleasure (such as\nits disinterestedness), that the pleasure is universally valid and\nhence that the object is beautiful.  But in the crucial section\n§9 of the Critique of Judgment, Kant appears to reject\nthat implication: rather than the pleasure preceding the judging, he\nsays, the “merely subjective (aesthetic) judging of the\nobject” both “precedes” and “is the ground\nof” the pleasure (218).  Since §9 is specifically addressed\nto the issue “whether in a judgment of taste the feeling of\npleasure precedes the judging of the object or the judging precedes\nthe pleasure,” a problem whose answer is “the key to the\ncritique of taste and hence deserves full attention” (216),\ncommentators have taken very seriously the task of reconciling §9\nwith Kant's other characterizations of the judgment of taste. \nOne very influential approach is that of Donald Crawford, who\naddresses this apparent paradox by distinguishing the\n“judging” of the object which, according to §9,\nprecedes the pleasure in it, from the judgment of taste proper, which\nis based on the pleasure (1974, pp. 69–74). An approach along these\nlines is developed in detail by Paul Guyer, who draws on passages\nelsewhere in the text to defend the view that a judgment of taste\nresults from two distinct acts of reflective judgment, the first\nidentifiable with the free play of the faculties and resulting in a\nfeeling of pleasure, the second an act of reflection on the pleasure\nwhich results in the claim that the pleasure is universally\ncommunicable. (See his (1979), especially pp. 110–119 and\npp. 151–160.)  A difficulty with that approach, however, recognized by\nGuyer, is that it conflicts with another passage at §9, in which\nKant describes the pleasure as consequent on the universal\ncommunicability of the subject's mental state in the given\nrepresentation (§9, 5:217).  This implies that the act of judging\nwhich precedes the pleasure must be one in which the subject takes her\nstate of mind to be universally communicable, requiring us to identify\nit with the judgment of taste proper rather than with an activity of\nthe faculty prior to that judgment.  Most commentators read the relevant paragraphs of §9 as\nrequiring some kind of “two-acts” view, and, at the very\nleast, as distinguishing the free play of the faculties from the\njudgment of taste proper.  This requires addressing the textual\ndifficulty just mentioned.  Guyer himself proposes disregarding the\nproblematic passage at 5:217, since he takes it to indicate the\nintrusion of an earlier, incompatible theory (1979, 139–140; for a\ndetailed discussion, see Guyer 1982); Allison suggests instead that\nthe passage be amended so that the pleasure is understood as\nconsequent on a “universally communicable” mental state,\nrather than on the state's universal communicability (2001,\np. 115).  An alternative approach to §9, which attempts to accommodate\nthe problematic passage without emendation, is offered in Ginsborg (1991).  On this\n“one-act” approach the act of judging something to be\nbeautiful is a single, self-referential act of judging which claims\nits own universal validity with respect to the object and which is\nphenomenologically manifested as a feeling of pleasure.  The free play\nof the faculties on this approach is identical with the judging of the\nobject to be beautiful and in turn with the feeling of pleasure: the\npleasure does not precede the judging of the object to be beautiful,\nand is “consequent” on it only in the sense that we feel\npleasure “in virtue” of the judgment. In its\nidentification of the pleasure and the judgment the view is like that\nof Richard Aquila (1982, see especially 107) and, more recently,\nRobert Wicks (2007, 43–45), although neither Aquila nor Wicks\nexplicitly endorses the apparent consequence, that the pleasure or\njudgment must involve a claim to its own universal\ncommunicability.  Longuenesse offers a view which is in partial\nagreement with Ginsborg's in that it understands pleasure in the\nbeautiful proper as felt in virtue of the subject's awareness of the\nuniversal communicability of her mental state in the presented object\n(thus, like the one-act approach, requiring no emendation of §9).\nHowever, rather than understand the pleasure as awareness of its own\nuniversal communicability, Longuenesse takes it to be awareness of a\nprior, and independent, feeling of pleasure elicited by the free play\nof the faculties, so that there are two distinct feelings of pleasure\ninvolved in judging an object to be beautiful (2003, 152–155; 2006,\npp. 203–208).  Objections to the one-act approach have been raised by a number of\ncommentators, in particular Allison, who partly endorses Ginsborg's\ncriticisms of Guyer, but raises difficulties for her reading of\n§9 (2001, 113–115) and, in particular, rejects the\nself-referential understanding of judgments of beauty as\n“inherently implausible” (2001, 115).  Allison objects\nalso that the one-act view fails to accommodate judgments of the ugly;\nfor more on Kant's views on the ugly, see Section 2.3.6.  Criticisms\nof Ginsborg's one-act approach are also to be found in Pippin (1996),\nAmeriks (1998), Palmer (2008), Vandenabeele (2008), Sweet (2009) and\nMakkai (2010).  Zuckert (2007, §§1–2 of ch. 8) defends a\none-act approach, but rejects identification of the pleasure and the\njudgment (see e.g. 2007, 313n46 and 336n26). \nKant's notion of the free play of the faculties (sometimes referred to\nas the “harmony of the faculties”) is probably the most\ncentral notion of his aesthetic theory.  But what is it for the\nfaculties of imagination and understanding to be in “free\nplay”? Kant describes the imagination and understanding in this\n“free play” as freely harmonizing, without the\nimagination's being constrained by the understanding as it is in\ncognition.  Imagination in the free play, he says, conforms to the\ngeneral conditions for the application of concepts to objects that are\npresented to our senses, yet without any particular concept being\napplied, so that imagination conforms to the conditions of\nunderstanding without the constraint of particular concepts.  Given\nKant's view that concepts are, or at least correspond to, rules by\nwhich imagination “synthesizes” or organizes the data of\nsense-perception, this amounts to saying that imagination functions in\na rule-governed way but without being governed by any rule in\nparticular. The free play thus manifests, in Kant's terms, “free\nlawfulness” or ”lawfulness without a law.” But there\nis an apparent paradox in these characterizations which is left\nunaddressed by Kant's own, largely metaphorical, explanations. It is\nleft to commentators to try to explain how such an activity is\nintelligible and why, if it is indeed intelligible, it should give\nrise to, or be experienced as, a feeling of pleasure. \nSome commentators try to make sense of the free play by appealing to\nthe phenomenology of aesthetic experience, for example to the kind of\nexperience involved in appreciating an abstract painting, where the\nsubject might imaginatively relate the various elements of the\npainting to one another and perceive them as having an order and unity\nwhich is non-conceptual; see for example Bell (1987, p. 237) and\nCrowther (1989, p. 56).  Others try to find a place for it in the\ncontext of Kant's theory of the imagination as presented in\nthe Critique of Pure Reason. Two contrasting accounts along\nthese lines are offered by Guyer, who identifies the free play with\nthe first two stages of the “three-fold synthesis”\ndescribed by Kant in the first edition Transcendental Deduction (Guyer\n1979, pp. 85–86), and of Makkreel (1990, pp. 49–58), for whom the free\nplay is an activity of schematizing pure concepts without the\ninvolvement of empirical concepts. Ginsborg (1997) criticizes previous\napproaches and offers an alternative view of the free play derived\nfrom her “one-act” reading of the judgment of taste\n(see Section 2.3.1), on which what it is for the\nimagination and understanding to be in free play just is for the\nsubject to be in a perceptual state of mind which involves a\nnonconceptual claim to its own universal validity with respect to the\nobject perceived.  Zinkin (2006) explains the free play in terms of\nthe sensus communis invoked by Kant at §20, which she\nunderstands as an intensive form of sensibility, in contrast to the\nextensive forms of sensibility represented by space and time.  As with the deduction of taste (see Section\n2.2), a number of commentators have looked to Kant's doctrine of\naesthetic ideas (officially part of his account of fine art) to make\nsense of the free play of the faculties; recent examples include\nRueger and Evren (2005), Kalar (2006), and Chignell (2007).  A\nparticularly detailed and thorough treatment of this approach is\noffered in Rogerson (2008) (for an earlier and briefer treatment, see\nRogerson 2004).  The question of how to understand the free play is complicated by\na more general interpretive issue concerning the status of Kant's\n“transcendental psychology”: this issue affects not only\nthe interpretation of the free play in the third Critique, but also\nthe appeal to activities of imagination and understanding in Kant's\naccount of the conditions of cognition in the first Critique, in\nparticular in the Metaphysical Deduction and the Transcendental\nDeduction.  Many commentators assume, whether tacitly or explicitly,\nthat the free play of imagination and understanding represents a\nnatural psychological process, taking place in time and thus subject\nto natural causal laws.  But it is hard to reconcile this\nunderstanding of the free play with Kant's appeal to it to justify the\nlegitimacy of judgments of beauty, and more generally his claim to be\noffering a transcendental account of judgments of beauty, one which\nshows such judgments to be founded on an a priori principle.\nGuyer's approach to the free play, from his 1979 onwards, has been\nthoroughly naturalistic; in his 2008 he offers a very explicit defence\nof this approach, arguing that we should reject Kant's claim to\nestablish an a priori or transcendental principle justifying\njudgments of beauty, and instead regard Kant's theory of aesthetics as\na contribution to the empirical psychology of taste.  While this kind\nof view is rarely explicitly endorsed, many commentators do in fact\noffer accounts of the free play which at least resemble empirical\npsychological accounts, raising the question of how Guyer's conclusion\nis to be avoided. \nThe views touched on in this section represent only a sampling of the\nvarious accounts of the free play which have been offered.  A useful\nsurvey is offered by Guyer (2006), who classifies various accounts\nunder three heads: “precognitive,” according to which the\nplay of the faculties is a preconceptual state, falling short of\ncognition (for example his own 1979 account),;\n“multicognitive,” in which the free play represents the\nplayful application of a multiplicity of concepts, and thus a kind of\ncognitive excess (for example Allison 2001); and\n“metacognitive,” in which the manifold is represented as\nhaving a unity which goes beyond what is required for cognition;\nGuyer's own (2006) view, in contrast to his (1979), favours the latter\napproach.  A variety of still more recent approaches to the free play\nare summarized and discussed in Guyer (2009). \nDoes the feeling of pleasure in a judgment of taste have intentional\ncontent? According to Guyer, the answer is no (see especially 1979,\npp. 99–119). Although Kant sometimes describes pleasure as awareness\nof the free play of the faculties, Guyer takes the relation between\nthe free play and the feeling of pleasure to be merely causal. The\npleasure is “opaque”: while one can come to recognize that\none's feeling of pleasure is due to the free play, this is not because\nthe pleasure makes one immediately aware of it, but rather because\nreflection on the causal history of one's pleasure can lead one to\nconclude that it was not sensory or due to the satisfaction of a\ndesire and hence (by elimination) must have been due to the free\nplay. While many commentors follow Guyer on this point, opposing views\nhave been taken by e.g., Aquila (1982), Ginsborg (1990, ch. 1, and\n1991), Allison (2001, in particular pp. 53–54, p. 69 and pp. 122–123)\nand Zuckert (2002; 2007, ch. 6). \nWhat kind of claim to agreement is made by a judgment of taste? Kant\nsuggests that a judgment of taste demands agreement in the same way\nthat an objective cognitive judgment demands agreement (see e.g.,\nIntroduction VII, 191 and §6, 211): just as, in claiming that a\nperceived object is green or square, I take it that everyone else\nought to share my judgment that the object is green or square, so, in\njudging an object to be beautiful, I claim that all other perceivers\nof the object should find it beautiful too.  But one might still raise\nquestions about the character of the demand, either because there are\nin turn questions to be raised about what it is for a cognitive\njudgment to claim agreement, or because it is not clear that the claim\ncan in fact be the same, given that in the aesthetic case one is\nclaiming that others share one's feeling, as opposed to\ndemanding that they apply the same concept to the object.  Guyer\n(1979) argues that the claim should be understood as a rational\nexpectation or ideal prediction: someone who judges an object to be\nbeautiful is claiming that under ideal circumstances\neveryone will share her pleasure (1979, pp. 139–147 and\npp. 162–164).  Savile (1987) and Chignell (2007) follow Guyer in\nunderstanding the claim in this way. \nGuyer's understanding of the claim has been criticized by a number of\ncommentators, including Rogerson (1982), Ginsborg (1990, ch. 2), Rind\n(2002), and Kalar (2006, ch. 1); a basic difficulty is that it fails\nto do justice to the normative language used by Kant to describe the\ndemand (for example that anyone who declares something to be beautiful\nholds that everyone ought to [sollen] give his approval to\nthe object and likewise declare it beautiful [§19, 5: 237]).\nRogerson proposes instead that a judgment of beauty makes a moral\ndemand on others to appreciate the object's beauty, so that the\n“ought” is to be understood as rational, and more\nspecifically moral, rather than merely predictive.  The other critics\nmentioned take the “ought”, and the corresponding claim to\nagreement to be non-moral, yet still genuinely normative as opposed to\npredictive; a view of this kind is assumed, with varying degrees of\nexplicitness, by a number of other commentators, including Allison\n(2001, see especially p. 159 and pp. 178–179; 2006, p. 132). \nBut this approach, which is perhaps closest to the letter of Kant's\ntext, raises a question: what kind of normativity is this, if not that\nassociated with morality or, more generally, practical rationality?\nIt is tempting to assimilate it to cognitive or epistemic normativity,\nwhere this in turn might be understood as the normativity involved in\nthe putative principles that one ought to believe what is true, or,\nalternatively, what is justified in light of the evidence.  However\nthis appears to conflict with Kant's commitment to the subjectivity\nand (relatedly) nonconceptuality of judgments of taste.  To avoid the\nconflict, while preserving the link Kant seems to assert between the\nnormativity of aesthetic judgment and that of cognitive judgment, we\nneed an understanding of the normativity such that it is a necessary\ncondition of cognition that we be able to make such normative demands\nfor agreement, yet without the normativity's simply being identified\nwith the cognitive or epistemic normativity associated with truth and\njustification.  Ginsborg (2006) identifies it with what she\ncalls the “primitive” normativity required for empirical\nconceptualization: our grasp of empirical concepts depends on the\npossibility of making such primitively normative claims, but they do\nnot in turn presuppose cognition, which leaves open the possibility\nthat such a claim is implicit in aesthetic experience and\njudgment. \nGranted, pace Guyer, that the claim is normative without\nbeing moral, further questions can be raised about its strength and\ncharacter.  Moran (2012) understands the demand as reflecting a sense\nof obligation or requirement, distinct from moral obligation, but\nstronger than that present in the case of empirical cognitive\njudgment.  He reads Kant as drawn towards a view on which the\nbeautiful object itself makes an unconditional demand on the viewer's\nattention (of a kind made vivid in the narrator's vow to the hawthorns\nin Proust's In Search of Lost Time), although he also takes\nKant's denial of the objectivity of taste to debar him from endorsing\nsuch a view.  A similar suggestion is made in Makkai (2010): she takes\nKant to hint at the idea that the beauitful object is found to\ndeserve, or call for, recognition as beautiful, where this implies a\nclaim on the viewer which goes beyond any claim implicit in an\nobjective judgment.  Roughly, on the view suggested by Moran and\nMakkai, the claim implicit in a judgment of beauty is not merely the\nconditional claim that others, if they perceive the object, ought to\njudge it to be beautiful; it is the unconditional claim that others\nought to perceive it and, in so doing, judge it to be beautiful.  The idea that Kant takes us to be subject to a demand to attend to\nbeautiful objects is also put forward in Kalar (2006), but Kalar\nunderstands that demand as one of two distinct normative demands made\nin the judgment of beauty: a non-moral demand to feel pleasure in the\ngiven object, and a further moral demand to attend to the object\n(2006, p.2). \nShould judgments of beauty be regarded as objective? Ameriks has\nargued (1982, 1983, 1998, 2000) that in spite of Kant's claim that\njudgments of beauty are “subjectively grounded,” they are\nnonetheless objective in the same sense that judgments of colour and\nother secondary qualities are objective. Similar views are proposed by\nSavile (1981) and Kulenkampff (1990); see also the references offered\nby Ameriks at (2003, 307n.1). The claim is challenged by Ginsborg\n(1998), who defends the subjectivity of taste on the grounds that Kant\ndoes not allow that we can make judgments of beauty on the basis of\nhearsay, but must “subject the object to our own eyes”\n(§8, 5:215–216); a similar point is made in Hopkins (2001), and\nthere is further discussion of aesthetic testimony in Gorodeisky\n(2009).  Ameriks responds to Ginsborg's challenge in his (1998); the\nobjectivity of taste is defended further in Makkai (2010).  The question of whether Kant should be interpreted as committed to\nthe objectivity of taste is closely related to the question of whether\nthere can be erroneous judgments of taste; for some discussion see\nCohen (1982), pp. 222–226 and Allison (2001), pp. 107–108. \nKant's discussion of judgments of beauty focusses almost exclusively\non the positive judgment that an object is beautiful, and relatedly,\nof the feeling of pleasure in a beautiful object. He has very little\nto say about the judgment that an object is not beautiful, or about\nthe displeasure associated with judging an object to be ugly. (As\nnoted in Section 2.7 below, he does take the\nappreciation of the sublime to involve a kind of displeasure, but this\nseems to be a different kind from the displeasure that might be\ninvolved in judging something to be ugly.) Does his treatment allow\nfor negative judgments of beauty, either that an object is not\nbeautiful or that it is ugly?  Shier (1998) argues that it does not,\nbut this has been challenged by Allison (2001), who takes it to be a\ncriterion for a satisfactory interpretation of Kant's theory of taste\nthat it allow for negative judgments of beauty (2001, p. 72; see also\npp. 184–186).  Others who have emphasized the need to consider the\nrole of the ugly in Kant's account of aesthetics include Hudson (1991)\nand Wenzel (1999).  It is useful, in considering this topic, to distinguish the\nquestion of how we can judge that something is not beautiful, from\nthat of how we can judge it to be ugly.  The former question can be\nseen an aspect of a more general problem about how we can make\njudgments in which ascriptions of beauty figure in embedded contexts,\nfor example as the antecedents of conditionals; this is akin to what\nis often referred to as the Frege-Geach problem for expressivism. The\nsecond question is more specific and can be framed in terms of\naesthetic experience: can Kant allow for an experience of displeasure\nin the ugly, and if he can, is it symmetrical with pleasure in the\nbeautiful?  Some commentators, for example Ginsborg (2003, pp. 175–177) and\nGuyer (2005a, ch. 6), have denied that there is such a thing, for\nKant, as pure displeasure in the ugly, or, correlatively a pure\njudgment of ugliness. Guyer argues that while there is displeasure in\nthe ugly it always involves an interest; Ginsborg allows also for\ndisinterested judgments of ugliness, but denies that these involve a\ncharacteristic feeling of displeasure; rather, we judge that something\nis ugly if it lacks beauty in a context where beauty is expected.\nMore generally, on her view, aside from cases where the judgment is\nbased on perception of an object as harmful or disgusting, judgments\nof the ugly depend on recognition of the context in which the object\nis presented; Gracyk defends a similar point, using it to argue that\n“ugly” objects are those which resist unification and are\nthus less pleasurable to perceive than other objects (Gracyk 1986,\np. 55) .  Guyer's view is criticized in McConnell (2008), which offers\na useful survey of previous discussions of the issue, and (partly\ndrawing on Gracyk 1986) provides a defence of pure judgments of\nugliness which appeals to Kant's theory of aesthetic ideas. \nAs noted at the end of Section 2.2, Kant's account\nof judgments of beauty has been criticized on the grounds that the\nargument for their universal validity, that is the Deduction of Pure\nAesthetic Judgments, is unsuccessful. Criticisms have also been raised\nagainst various aspects of Kant's characterization of judgments of\nbeauty in the Analytic of the Beautiful. Objections have been raised\nin particular to Kant's view that judgments of beauty are\ndisinterested, and to his supposed commitment to aesthetic formalism\n(the view that all that matters for aesthetic appreciation is the\nabstract formal pattern manifested by the object, that is, the way in\nwhich its elements are interrelated in space and/or time). For\ndiscussion of the questions of disinterestedness and formalism, see\nGuyer (1979, chs. 5 and 6), and Allison (2001, chs. 4 and 5); Zuckert\noffers a sympathetic reading of Kant's formalism (2007, pp. 182–189).\nKant's formalism was particularly influential, via the influence of\nHanslick, in musical theory; for recent discussion see Kivy (2009),\nch. 2. \nTypically objections to Kant's view of pleasure as disinterested\nappeal to the apparently obvious fact that we do in fact take an\ninterest in the preservation of beautiful objects (see for example\nCrawford 1974, p. 53). A different kind of objection, based on an\nappeal to the cognitive role of aesthetic judging, is made in Pillow\n(2006).  Kant has also been criticized for a view that is taken to be a\nconsequence of the thesis that judgments of beauty are disinterested,\nnamely the view that aesthetic experience requires a special attitude\nof “psychical distance” or “detachment” from\nthe object appreciated: this criticism is generally taken to be\nimplicit in Dickie's well-known (1964) discussion of the “myth\nof the aesthetic attitude.” Zangwill (1992) argues that this\ncriticism is misplaced. \nKant's view that the pleasure in a beautiful object is non-conceptual\nhas been taken to commit him to the objectionable view that the\ncapacity to make conceptual distinctions can play no role in the\nappreciation of beauty. This criticism is addressed in Janaway (1997).\nRelatedly, it has been objected Kant does not allow room for\nreason-giving, and more generally, criticism in aesthetics; that\nobjection is addressed in Crawford (1970) and (on lines suggested by\nCrawford) in Wilson (2007). \n\nThis article so far has been concerned only with “pure”\njudgments of beauty. But Kant also allows for judgments of beauty\nwhich fall short of being pure. Judgments of beauty can fail to be\npure in two ways. (a) They can be influenced by the object's sensory\nor emotional appeal, that is, they can involve “charm”\n[Reiz] or emotion [Rührung] (§13). (b)\nThey can be contingent on a certain concept's applying to the object,\nso that the object is judged, not as beautiful tout court,\nbut as beautiful qua belonging to this or that kind. The\nsecond kind of impurity is discussed in §16 in connection with a\ndistinction between “free” [frei] beauty and\n“adherent” or “dependent”\n[anhängend] beauty. \nOne reason to think that the distinction is important is that Kant\nseems to suggest that all judgments of beauty about representational\nart are judgments of adherent rather than of free beauty, and hence\nthat they are all impure. While some art works can be “free\nbeauties,” the examples Kant gives are all of\nnon-representational art: “designs a la grecque, foliage for\nborders or on wallpaper…fantasias in music,” and indeed,\nKant adds, all music without a text (§16, 229). It might be\nsupposed from this that Kant's core account of judgments of beauty is\nonly peripherally applicable to art, which would make it largely\nirrelevant to the concerns of contemporary aesthetics. However, this\nconsequence is debatable. For example, Allison argues that judgments\nof adherent beauty contain, as a component, a pure judgment of\nbeauty. The purity of this core judgment is not undermined by its\nfiguring in a more complex evaluation which takes into account the\nobject's falling under a concept (2001, pp. 140–141). \nKant's suggestion that representational art has “adherent”\nrather than “free” beauty, and that judgments about such\nart fail to be pure, might also invite the objection that Kant takes\nnonrepresentational art to be superior to representational art, so\nthat, say, wallpaper designs are aesthetically more valuable than the\nceiling of the Sistine Chapel. This objection is challenged by Schaper\n(1979, ch. 4, reprinted in Guyer 2003) and by Guyer (2005a, chs. 4 and\n5).  Further discussions of the distinction between free and adherent\nbeauty include Scarre (1981), Lorand (1989), Gammon (1999),\nKalar (2006), pp. 82–89, and Zuckert (2007), pp. 202–212. \nWhile Kant attaches special importance to the beauty of nature (see\ne.g., FI XI, 20:244), he also makes clear that judgments of beauty may\nbe made also about “fine” or “beautiful” art\n[schöne Kunst]. In the course of his treatment of\nbeautiful art in §§43–54 he discusses fine art in relation\nto the production of human artifacts more generally (§43),\ncompares fine art to the “arts” of entertaining (telling\njokes, decorating a table, providing background music) (§44), and\nmakes some remarks about the relation between the beauty of art and\nthat of nature, claiming in particular that fine art must “look\nto us like nature” in that it must seem free and unstudied\n(§45). Kant also offers a typology of the various fine arts\n(§51) and a comparison of their respective aesthetic value\n(§53), with poetry at the top and music — at least as far\nas the “cultivation of the mind” is concerned — at\nthe bottom.  Kant's remarks about music in §§51–54 suggest\nthat music might not even qualify as beautiful, as opposed to merely\nagreeable, art.  This is seemingly in tension with Kant's reference to\nmusic without words as an example of “free beauty”\n(§16, 5:229).  Of particular interest, within Kant's account of fine art, is his\ndiscussion of how beautiful art objects can be produced\n(§§46–50). The artist cannot produce a beautiful work by\nlearning, and then applying, rules which determine when something is\nbeautiful; for no such rules can be specified (see the sketch of the\nSecond Moment in Section 2.1 above). But, Kant\nmakes clear, the artist's activity must still be rule-governed, since\n“every art presupposes rules” (§46, 307) and the\nobjects of art must serve as models or examples, that is, they must\nserve as a “standard or rule by which to judge” (§46,\n308). Kant's solution to this apparent paradox is to postulate a\ncapacity, which he calls “genius,” by which “nature\ngives the rule to art” (§46, 307). An artist endowed with\ngenius has a natural capacity to produce objects which are\nappropriately judged as beautiful, and this capacity does not require\nthe artist him- or herself to consciously follow rules for the\nproduction of such objects; in fact the artist himself does not know,\nand so cannot explain, how he or she was able to bring them into\nbeing. “Genius” here means something different from\nbrilliance of intellect. For example, Newton, for all his intellectual\npower, does not qualify as having genius, because he was capable of\nmaking clear, both to himself and others, the procedures through which\nhe arrived at his scientific discoveries (§47, 308–309). \nA further point of interest in Kant's discussion of art is his claim\nthat beauty is the “exhibition” [Darstellung,\nalso translated “presentation”] (§49, 314) or\n“expression” (§51, 319) of aesthetic ideas. Kant\ndescribes an aesthetic idea as “a representation of the\nimagination that occasions much thinking, though without it being\npossible for any determinate thought, i.e., concept, to be adequate to\nit” (§49, 314). Such ideas, he says, are a\n“counterpart” to rational ideas, that is, representations\nwhich cannot be exemplified in experience or by means of imagination\n(ibid.). While part of Kant's point here is to contrast aesthetic and\nrational ideas, it is clear that he sees the role of aesthetic ideas\nas mediating between rational ideas on the one hand, and sensibility\nand imagination on the other. A work of art expresses or exhibits an\naesthetic idea in so far as it succeeds in giving sensible form to a\nrational idea. Thus aesthetic ideas “seek to approximate to an\nexhibition” of rational ideas. For example, the poet\n“ventures to make sensible rational ideas of invisible beings,\nthe realm of the blessed, the realm of hell, eternity, creation etc.,\nas well as to make that of which there are examples in experience,\ne.g., death, envy, and all sorts of vices, as well as love, fame,\netc., sensible beyond the limits of experience, with a completeness\nwhich goes beyond anything of which there is an example in\nnature” (ibid.).  While aesthetic ideas are discussed only in the sections of\nthe Critique of Judgment which deal with artistic beauty, and\nnot in the “Analytic of the Beautiful,” which deals with\nbeauty more generally, Kant remarks parenthetically that natural as\nwell as artistic beauty is the expression of aesthetic ideas\n(§51, 321). This claim has been thought by some commentators to\nbe problematic. Some commentators have also seen a tension between the\n“expressionistic” doctrine of aesthetic ideas and the\nsupposedly “formalistic” view presented in the\n“Analytic of the Beautiful”; for a response to this worry,\nsee Allison (2001, pp. 288–290). \nA related question concerns the relative importance for Kant of\nnatural as opposed to artistic beauty. Guyer (1993, ch. 7) offers a\ndefence of the importance of natural beauty, and criticizes Kemal's\n(1986) view that artistic beauty is the paradigm object of aesthetic\nexperience for Kant. \nKant's theory of aesthetic ideas has often been considered as\nperipheral to his aesthetic theory, but a number of commentators have\nargued that it is necessary in order to make sense of the core of\nKant's view of pure judgments of taste; see for example Savile (1987),\nRogerson (2004) and (2008), Rueger and Evren (2005), Kalar (2006), and\nChignell (2007).  There has been some discussion of Kant's ranking of the fine arts,\nand particularly of the low ranking he accords to music; on the latter\ntopic, see for example Weatherston (1996), Parret (1998a) and Kivy\n(2009), ch. 2. \nKant distinguishes two notions of the sublime: the mathematically\nsublime and the dynamically sublime. In the case of both notions, the\nexperience of the sublime consists in a feeling of the superiority of\nour own power of reason, as a supersensible faculty, over nature\n(§28, 261). \nIn the case of the mathematically sublime, the feeling of reason's\nsuperiority over nature takes the form, more specifically, of a\nfeeling of reason's superiority to imagination, conceived of as the\nnatural capacity required for sensory apprehension, including the\napprehension of the magnitudes of empirically given things. We have\nthis feeling when we are confronted with something that is so large\nthat it overwhelms imagination's capacity to comprehend it. In such a\nsituation imagination strives to comprehend the object in accordance\nwith a demand of reason, but fails to do so. “Just because there\nis in our imagination a striving to advance to the infinite, while in\nour reason there lies a claim to absolute totality, as to a real idea,\nthe very inadequacy of our faculty for estimating the magnitude of the\nthings in the sensible world [viz., imagination] awakens the feeling\nof a supersensible faculty in us” (§25, 250). The fact that\nwe are capable, through reason, of thinking infinity as a whole,\n“indicates a faculty of the mind which surpasses every standard\nof sense” (§26, 254). While Kant's discussion of the\nmathematically sublime mentions the Pyramids in Egypt and St. Peter's\nBasilica in Rome (§26, 252), it is not clear that these are\nintended as examples of the sublime; and Kant claims explicitly that\nthe most appropriate examples are of things in nature. More\nspecifically, they must be natural things the concept of which does\nnot involve the idea of a purpose (§26, 252–253): this rules out\nanimals, the concept of which is connected with the idea of biological\nfunction, but it apparently includes mountains and the sea (§26,\n256). \nIn the case of the dynamically sublime, the feeling of reason's\nsuperiority to nature is more direct than in the mathematical\ncase. Kant says that we consider nature as “dynamically\nsublime” when we consider it as “a power that has no\ndominion over us” (§28, 260). We have the feeling of the\ndynamically sublime when we experience nature as fearful while knowing\nourselves to be in a position of safety and hence without in fact\nbeing afraid. In this situation “the irresistibility of\n[nature's] power certainly makes us, considered as natural beings,\nrecognize our physical powerlessness, but at the same time it reveals\na capacity for judging ourselves as independent of nature and a\nsuperiority over nature…whereby the humanity in our person\nremains undemeaned even though the human being must submit to that\ndominion” (§28, 261–262). Kant's examples include\noverhanging cliffs, thunder clouds, volcanoes and hurricanes\n(§28, 261). \nThe feeling associated with the sublime is a feeling of pleasure in\nthe superiority of our reason over nature, but it also involves\ndispleasure. In the case of the mathematically sublime, the\ndispleasure comes from the awareness of the inadequacy of our\nimagination; in the dynamical case it comes from the awareness of our\nphysical powerlessness in the face of nature's might. Kant is not\nconsistent in his descriptions of how the pleasure and the displeasure\nare related, but one characterization describes them as alternating:\nthe “movement of the mind” in the representation of the\nsublime “may be compared to a vibration, i.e., to a rapidly\nalternating repulsion from and attraction to one and the same\nobject” (§27, 258). Kant also describes the feeling of the\nsublime as a “pleasure which is possible only by means of a\ndispleasure” (§27, 260) and as a “negative\nliking” (General Remark following §29, 269). He also\nappears to identify it with the feeling of respect, which in his\npractical philosophy is associated with recognition of the moral law\n(§27, 257). \nJudgments of the sublime are like judgments of beauty in being based\non feeling, more specifically on pleasure or liking. They are also\nlike judgments of beauty in claiming the universal validity of the\npleasure, where that claim is understood as involving necessity\n(everyone who perceives the object ought to share the feeling)\n(§29, 266). But as we have seen, the pleasure is different in\nthat it involves a negative element. The following differences should\nalso be noted: \nThe importance of the sublime within Kant's aesthetic theory is a\nmatter of dispute. In the Introductions to the Critique of\nJudgment, Kant has a great deal to say about the beautiful, but\nmentions the sublime only fleetingly (FI XII, 249–250) and in\nthe Analytic of the Sublime itself he notes that “the concept of\nthe sublime in nature is far from being as important and rich in\nconsequences as that of its beauty” and that the “theory\nof the sublime is a mere appendix to the aesthetic judging of the\npurposiveness of nature” (§23, 246). Kant's views about the\nsublime also appear to be less historically distinctive than his views\nabout the beautiful, showing in particular the influence of Burke. On\nthe other hand, Kant's account of the sublime has been influential in\nliterary theory (see Section 2.9 below), and the\nsublime also plays a significant role in Kant's account of the\nconnection between aesthetic judgment and morality\n(see Section 2.5 below). \nAnother focus of debate concerns the question of whether sublimity,\naccording to Kant, is restricted to objects of nature, or whether\nthere can also be sublime art.  A good overview of Kant's theory of the sublime and its connection\nwith Kant's aesthetic theory more generally is provided by Crowther\n(1989); other useful expositions include Guyer (1993, ch. 7), Budd\n(1998) and Allison (2001, ch. 13).  The question of the artistic\nsublime in particular has been raised by Abaci (2008), who defends\nKant's restriction of sublimity to nature; Clewis (2010) defends the\nopposite view.  A possible case study is offered by Myskja (2002), who\nattempts to bring the notion of the sublime to bear on a specific work\nof art, Samuel Beckett's Molloy. \nThe connection between aesthetic judgment and moral feeling is a\npersistent theme in the Critique of Judgment. As noted\nin Section 2.3.4 above, some commentators take\nthe demand for universal validity made by a judgment of beauty to\namount to a moral demand, so that Kant's argument for the universal\nvalidity of such judgments depends on an appeal to morality. A more\ncommon view, however, is to see judgments of beauty not as grounded in\nmorality, but rather, along with judgments of the sublime, as\ncontributing to an account of moral feeling, and hence of how morality\nis possible for human beings (for a clear statement of the contrast\nbetween these views, see the introduction to Guyer 1993). \nThe idea that aesthetic judgment plays a role in grounding the\npossibility of morality for human beings is suggested at a very\ngeneral level in the Introduction to the Critique of\nJudgment, where Kant describes the faculty of judgment as\nbridging “the great gulf” betweeen the concept of nature\nand that of freedom (IX, 195). While Kant says that the concept or\nprinciple of judgment which mediates the transition between nature and\nfreedom is that of the “purposiveness of nature,” which\ncould simply be understood as referring to nature's scientific\ncomprehensibility (see Section 3.2 below), he also\nassociates judgment in this context with the feeling of pleasure and\ndispleasure, making clear that it is not only judgment in the context\nof empirical scientific enquiry, but also aesthetic judgment, which\nplays this bridging role. \nThe “Critique of Aesthetic Judgment” mentions a number of\nmore specific connections between aesthetics and morality, including\nthe following: \n\nThere is an influential discussion of beauty as the symbol of morality\nin Cohen (1982). More recently, the connection between aesthetics and\nmorality, and in particular the role of aesthetics in supporting the\nhuman moral vocation, has been emphasized by Guyer; see the\nintroduction to his (1993), and, more recently, (2003c). \nKant himself clearly takes his aesthetic theory to be of central\nimportance for the understanding of the so-called “faculty of\njudgment” generally (see Section 1 above): this\nimplies that he takes it to be of importance for understanding\nempirical scientific enquiry, and in particular for our understanding\nof biological phenomena. As noted in Section 2.8\nabove, there are also significant connections between Kant's views on\naesthetics and his views on ethics. A number of commentators have, in\naddition, laid special weight on the connection between Kant's\naesthetics and his views on empirical cognition. In particular, Bell\n(1987) and Ginsborg (1990, 1997 and 2006) have argued that Kant's\naccount of empirical cognition depends on his account of the\nexperience of beauty.  The idea that a full understanding of Kant's\nviews on cognition depends on taking seriously his account of\naesthetics is becoming increasingly widely accepted; see the\nintroduction to Kukla (2006), a collection of essays exploring the\nconnection between aesthetics and cognition in Kant.  However, it is\nby no means uncontroversial that Kant's aesthetics makes a substantive\ncontribution to his theory of cognition more generally.  Guyer\nemphasizes the role played by the third Critique in supporting Kant's\nmoral theory, in explicit contrast to the suggestion that it was\nintended to fill an “imaginary gap in his epistemology”\n(2009, 215).  Kant's view that judgments of beauty manifest the exercise of a\nmore general faculty of judgment have inspired a number of\nphilosophers to view aesthetic judgment as a model for judgment\ngenerally in both the cognitive and the practical domain. Cavell\n(1976, ch. 3) draws connections between judgments of beauty, as\ndescribed by Kant, and our intuitive judgments (typically associated\nwith “ordinary language philosophy,” but prevalent in\nphilosophy more generally) about correct use of language. Arendt\n(1982) applies Kant's theory of aesthetic judgment within the sphere\nof political philosophy; relatedly, Fleischacker (1999) sees\nconnections between aesthetic judgment for Kant and moral and\npolitical judgment generally.  Ginsborg (2011) uses Kant's aesthetic\ntheory as the basis for a response to the skepticism about rules and\nmeaning which Kripke attributes to Wittgenstein. \n\nKant's aesthetic theory has also been extensively discussed within\nliterary theory, where there has been particular emphasis on Kant's\ntheory of the sublime. See for example Weiskel (1976) and Hertz\n(1978), both of whom interpret Kant's account of the sublime in\npsychoanalytic terms, as well as the discussions of the Kantian\nsublime in de Man (1990) and Lyotard (1994). Kant's aesthetic theory\nmore generally is discussed in Derrida (1981, 1987); while the work of\nDerrida and other deconstructionists has been largely ignored or\ndismissed by commentators within the analytic tradition of philosophy,\nit has been influential among literary theorists. \nWhile Kant's ethical theory makes frequent reference to the ends or\npurposes adopted by human beings, the “Critique of Teleological\nJudgment” is concerned with the idea of ends or purposes in\nnature. (The terms “end” and “purpose” in\ntranslations of the Critique of Judgment both correspond to\nthe German term Zweck; the cognate German\nterm Zweckmässigkeit is generally translated as\n“purposiveness,” although the term “finality”\nhas sometimes also been used.  “End” is the standard\ntranslation of Zweck in the moral writings, but\n“purpose” has more currency in the literature on\nthe Critique of Judgment, so I use it here.)  Among the most\nstriking elements of Kant's account of natural teleology are (i) his\nclaim, in the “Analytic of Teleological Judgment,” that\norganisms must be regarded by human beings in teleological terms,\ni.e., as “natural purposes,” and (ii) his attempt, in the\n“Dialectic of Teleological Judgment,” to reconcile this\nteleological conception of organisms with a mechanistic account of\nnature. These are described here in Section 3.3 and 3.4,\nrespectively. Prior to this, Section 3.1 outlines Kant's notions of\npurpose and purposiveness in general and Section 3.2 sketches nature's\n“purposiveness for our cognitive faculties,” i.e., its\namenability to empirical scientific enquiry. The discussion of\nbiological teleology and its relation to mechanism in Sections 3.3 and\n3.4 is followed by two sections dealing with further aspects of Kant's\nteleology: Section 3.5 deals with Kant's view that nature as a whole\nmay be regarded as a system of purposes, and Section 3.6 with the\nimplications of this teleological view of nature for morality and\nreligion.  Section 3.7 returns to Kant's biological teleology,\nconsidering briefly its implications for contemporary biological\nthought. \nThe notions of purpose or end [Zweck] and of purposiveness\n[Zweckmässigkeit] are defined by Kant in the\n“Critique of Aesthetic Judgment,” in a section entitled\n“On Purposiveness in General” (§10). A purpose is\n“the object of a concept, in so far as the concept as seen as\nthe cause of the object,” and purposiveness is “the\ncausality of a concept with respect to its object” (§10,\n220). But Kant often uses the terms “purpose” and\n“purposive” in ways that are related to, but do not quite\nfit, these definitions. In particular “purpose” is\nsometimes used to apply to the concept rather than the corresponding\nobject (e.g., Introduction IV, 180), and “purposiveness”\nis usually used to denote, not the causality of the concept, but the\nproperty in virtue of which an object counts as a purpose (e.g., FI\nIX, 234). Kant also characterizes “purposiveness” as the\n“lawfulness of the contingent as such” (FI VI, 217; see\nalso FI VIII, 228, Introduction V, 184, and §76, 404). \nKant's initial definition at §10 suggests that the paradigm of a\npurpose is a human artifact, since this typically comes into being as\na result of the artisan's having a concept of the object he or she\nplans to produce, a concept which is thus causally efficacious in\nproducing its object. Such an object is the result of design. But Kant\ngoes on to claim that something can qualify as a purpose, or as\npurposive, not only if it is in fact brought about as a result of\ndesign, but if we can conceive its possibility only on the assumption\nthat it was produced according to design: “an object or a state\nof mind or even an action... is called purposive merely because its\npossibility can only be explained and conceived by us in so far as we\nassume at its ground a causality in accordance with purposes”\n(§10, 220). Kant thinks that this is the case in particular for\norganisms, which are “natural purposes”\n(see Section 3.3 below). But the notion of\npurposiveness also applies more broadly, and Kant distinguishes\nvarious different kinds of purposiveness applying not only to\norganisms and artifacts, but also to beautiful objects, to nature as a\nwhole (both in so far as it is comprehensible to human beings, and in\nso far as it is a system of purposes standing in purposive relations\nto one another), to the functioning of our cognitive faculties in\naesthetic appreciation and empirical scientific enquiry, to\ngeometrical figures, and even to objects that are useful or agreeable\nto human beings. \nBecause Kant's terminology is not always consistent, it is difficult\nto provide a definitive characterization of the various types of\npurposiveness. However, the following simplified scheme may serve as a\nguide. The notion of purposiveness is divided in the first instance\ninto subjective and objective purposiveness. Both\nkinds of purposiveness are in turn divided into formal\nand material (or real). The most important kinds of\npurposiveness for the concerns of the Critique of Judgment\nare (i) subjective formal purposiveness and (ii) objective material\npurposiveness. Subjective formal purposiveness corresponds both to the\n“aesthetic” purposiveness displayed by beautiful objects\n(or by the activity of our cognitive faculties in the perception of\nthem) and to the “logical” purposiveness displayed by\nnature as a whole in so far as it is comprehensible to human beings\n(see Section 3.2). Objective material purposiveness\ncorresponds to the purposiveness displayed both by organisms qua\n“natural purposes” (see Section 3.3)\nand by arrangements of natural things or processes which stand to one\nanother in means-end relations (see Section\n3.5). But Kant also allows for subjective material purposiveness,\nwhich is the kind of purposiveness exhibited by an agreeable object,\ni.e., one which pleases our senses (FI VIII, 224); and for objective\nformal purposiveness, which is exhibited by geometrical figures in\nvirtue of their fruitfulness for solving mathematical problems\n(§62). \nA further important distinction is that between objective material\npurposiveness which is inner, and objective material\npurposiveness which is merely outer or relative;\nthis distinguishes the kind of purposiveness possessed by organisms\nfrom that in virtue of which one natural thing or process stands in a\nmeans-end relation to another. Kant also claims in one passage (FI\nXII, 249–250) that the distinction between inner and relative\npurposiveness applies to subjective as well as objective\npurposiveness, serving to separate the beautiful from the sublime. \nThe distinctions among these various kinds of purposiveness have been\ntreated in detail by Marc-Wogau (1938) and Tonelli (1958). \nThere has been disagreement among commentators about whether there is\nany underlying philosophical unity to Kant's notion of purposiveness,\nand, in particular, whether the notion of purposiveness which figures\nin the aesthetic context is the same as that which figures in Kant's\naccount of organisms. Guyer takes Kant to be operating with two\ndifferent senses of “purposiveness,” one applying to\nartifacts (and, presumably, organisms), the other applying to objects\nof aesthetic appreciation. While purposiveness in the former sense\ncorresponds to Kant's account of purposiveness at §10 in terms of\nthe notion of design, the notion of purposiveness as it applies to\nbeautiful objects does not involve the idea of real or apparent\ndesign, but simply that of the satisfaction of an aim or objective\n(1979, pp. 213–218; see also 1993, p. 417n.39).  An opposing view is defended in Ginsborg 1997a, which draws on\nKant's characterization of purposiveness as the “lawfulness of\nthe contingent as such” (FI VI, 20:217; see also FI VIII,\n20:228; Introduction V, 5:184; and §76, 5:404) to argue for a\nunivocal conception on which purposiveness is understood as normative\nlawfulness.  Zuckert also lays emphasis on Kant's identification of\npurposiveness as the “lawfulness of the contingent” (2007,\npp. 5–7), but rejects Ginsborg's view that this in turn amounts to\nnormative lawfulness as such (2007, 84n28); on her view, the\nlawfulness of the contingent is to be understood as “the unity\nof the diverse” (2007, p. 5) or the “form of unity of\ndiversity as such” (2007, p. 15). The normative conception of\npurposiveness is also criticized by Teufel (2011), who argues that\nKant held an etiological and non-teleological conception of\npurposiveness: on Teufel's view, an ascription of purposiveness to an\nobject makes an ontological claim to the effect that the object is the\noutcome of a rational, conceptually guided process. \nKant claims in the Introductions to the Critique of Judgment\nthat it is an a priori principle of reflecting judgment that\nnature is “purposive for our cognitive faculties” or\n“purposive for judgment.” This principle is, in the\nterminology of the Critique of Pure Reason, regulative rather\nthan constitutive. We cannot assert that nature is, as a matter of\nobjective fact, purposive for our cognitive faculties, but it is a\ncondition of the exercise of reflecting judgment that we assume\nnature's purposiveness for our cognitive faculties. The assumption\nthat nature is purposive for our cognitive faculties is not, strictly\nspeaking, part of teleology, since the purposiveness at issue is\nsubjective, and teleological judgments are concerned only with\nobjective purposiveness (see e.g., FI VII, 20:221). But it is\nnonetheless relevant to Kant's teleology, since our entitlement to\nascribe objective purposiveness to natural things, in particular to\norganisms, derives from our more fundamental entitlement to regard\nnature as (subjectively) purposive for our cognitive faculties (FI VI,\n20:218; Introduction VIII, 5:193–194). \nKant characterizes the principle of nature's purposiveness in a\nvariety of different ways which he seems to treat as interchangeable\neven though they do not, on the face of it, come to the same\nthing. The variety of characterizations stems in part from the variety\nof different tasks he seems to ascribe to reflecting judgment\nitself. In addition to being responsible for aesthetic judgments, and\nto supplying the concept of purposiveness which is required for\nteleological judgments, reflecting judgment seems to be ascribed the\nfollowing cognitive tasks: the classification of natural things into a\nhierarchy of genera and species; the construction of explanatory\nscientific theories in which more specific natural laws are\nrepresented as falling under higher and more general laws; the\nrepresentation of nature as empirically\nlawlike überhaupt; and the formation of empirical\nconcepts überhaupt. Because the principle of nature's\npurposiveness is, in effect, the principle that nature is amenable to\nthe activity of reflecting judgment itself, it seems to allow of being\nformulated in a corresponding variety of ways, that is, as a principle\nof nature's taxonomic systematicity, of its explanatory systematicity,\nof its empirical lawlikeness, and of its empirical\nconceptualizability. \nKant's discussion of the principle of nature's purposiveness for our\ncognitive faculties, and his related earlier discussion (in the\nAppendix to the Transcendental Dialectic of the Critique of Pure\nReason) of the regulative principle of nature's systematicity,\nhave, together, been seen as very important for the understanding of\nKant's views on empirical science. Moreover, to the extent that the\nprinciple is seen as required not only for the construction of\nsystematic scientific theories, but also for the recognition of\nnature's empirical lawlikeness or (even more fundamentally) for the\npossibility of any empirical concept-formation at all, it takes on\ngreat importance for an understanding of Kant's views on empirical\ncognition generally. However, Kant's discussion of the principle has\nbeen thought to pose a number of serious interpretative and\nphilosophical difficulties, including the following: \n(1) How are the various formulations of the principle related? Kant\nseems to regard them as amounting to the same, and thus to be\ncommitted to the view that if nature is empirically conceptualizable\nat all, we must also recognize the empirical regularities it manifests\nas lawlike, and the corresponding concepts and laws must fall under a\nsystematic hierarchy. But it is not clear how such a view is to be\njustified. It seems quite conceivable that natural things could be\nconceptualizable (say, under familiar concepts like dog\nor granite) without those concepts in turn figuring in a\nsystematic hierarchy. Relatedly, it also seems conceivable that we\ncould apply such concepts to natural things without being able to\ndetect any lawlike connections among the corresponding properties, let\nalone connections which in turn allow of being incorporated into an\noverarching system of empirical laws. (2) Regardless of how one understands the task of reflecting\njudgment, and the content of the corresponding principle, why is it a\ncondition of the successful exercise of reflecting judgment that we\nassume that nature is suitable for reflecting judgment? Why can't we\npursue our attempts, say, to arrive at a systematic hierarchy of\nnatural concepts and laws, without assuming in advance that nature\nwill favour our efforts? \n(3) If the principle is indeed required, as Kant suggests it is, for\nthe empirical conceptualization of nature and for the recognition of\nnature as empirically lawlike, then it would seem to be a condition of\nthe possibility of experience. But then why is it regulative rather\nthan constitutive? Relatedly, how are we to reconcile the respective\nroles of the pure concepts of the understanding (in particular the\nconcept of causality) on the one hand, with the principle of nature's\npurposiveness for our cognitive faculties on the other? If Kant has\nalready shown, in the Analytic of the Critique of Pure\nReason, that nature is subject to causal laws, then why is there\nany need for a further principle to account for the recognition of\nnature as empirically lawlike? \nMuch of the discussion of these and related questions was stimulated\nby Buchdahl, who argues (1969, 1969a) that the principle of causality\nin the Analytic of the Critique of Pure Reason is\ninsufficient to account for nature's subordination to particular\ncausal laws and that, in addition, a principle of systematicity is\nrequired to account for nature's empirical lawlikeness.  A similar\nview is developed by Philip Kitcher (1986); for a somewhat revised\nview, see his (1994).  Guyer (1990a) follows McFarland (1970) in\nascribing less cognitive significance to the principle of nature's\npurposiveness for our cognitive faculties, holding that it is required\nonly to provide us with rational motivation for attempts at\nsystematizing nature; see also Guyer (1990b), (1979, ch. 2) and\n(2003b).  Floyd (1998) and Allison (2001, ch. 1) claim that the\nprinciple represents Kant's answer to Hume's problem of induction;\nGinsborg (1990, ch. 4; 1990a) takes it to be a condition of empirical\nconceptualization and hence of all empirical judgment, not just of\njudgments based on inductive inference. An even stronger view is\nsuggested by Abela (2006), who takes it to be required as a condition\nfor empirical truth, which he sees as required in turn for the\npossibility of any object-directed representation.  Geiger (2009) also\nholds that the principle is required for all empirical cognition (see\nalso Geiger 2003), but argues that it is in the “Critique of\nTeleological Judgment”, and not in the Introductions to\nthe Critique of Judgment (nor in the Appendix to the\nDialectic of the first Critique), that Kant offers his\nfullest argument for its necessity.  Other useful discussions of Kant's views on the systematicity of\nnature are to be found in Horstmann (1989), Brandt (1989), Butts\n(1990), Friedman (1991 and 1992, ch. 5), Patricia Kitcher (1990\nch. 8), Walker (1990), Brittan (1992).  There has been considerable discussion of the relation between the\nprinciple of nature's systematicity in Kant's theoretical philosophy\nand the activity of reflecting judgment in aesthetic experience; see\nfor example Ginsborg (1990a), Pippin (1996), Allison (2001, ch. 2),\nGuyer (2003a), Baz (2005), Caranti (2005) and Hughes (2006; 2007,\nch. 7). \n\nIn §§64–65 of the Analytic of Teleological Judgment, Kant\nintroduces the notion of a “natural purpose” or\n“natural end” [Naturzweck] and argues both that\n“organized beings,” that is, plants and animals,\ninstantiate the concept of a natural purpose and also that they are\nthe only beings in nature that do so (§65, 376). (Kant sometimes\nsays that they are natural purposes, and sometimes only that they must\nbe “regarded” or “considered” as natural\npurposes.) Organized beings (or, to use the more modern term,\n“organisms”) are, or must be considered as, purposes\nbecause we can conceive of their possibility only on the assumption\nthat they were produced in accordance with design. They thus meet the\ndefinition of “purpose” given at §10. (In the terms\nintroduced in Section 3.1, they display\n“inner objective material purposiveness.”) But they are,\nor must be considered, as products of nature rather than products of\nconscious design. \nWhat makes an organism qualify as a natural purpose is that it is\n“both cause and effect of itself” (§64, 371). Kant\ngives a preliminary explanation of this idea at §64 by calling\nattention to three respects in which an organism, such as a tree,\nstands in a causal relation to its own existence. First, in producing\noffspring which resemble it, a tree “produces itself as far as\nits species is concerned,” so that the species of the tree\nmaintains itself in existence. Second, a tree preserves itself as an\nindividual by taking in nourishment from outside and converting it\ninto the kind of organic substance of which it, itself, is\nmade. Third, and most important, the various parts of a tree mutually\nmaintain one another in existence and hence maintain the whole tree in\nexistence. For example, while the leaves are produced by the tree as a\nwhole and depend on it for their growth and maintenance, they are in\nturn necessary for the growth and maintenance of the other parts of\nthe tree, for example the trunk and roots. Kant also mentions a number\nof further phenomena illustrating the way in which an organism is\n“cause and effect” of itself, in particular the capacity\nof certain organisms to regenerate missing parts, and more generally\nthe capacity of organisms to repair damage to themselves. \nKant goes into more detail about the notion of a natural purpose in\n§65, where he specifies two conditions something must meet in\norder to be a natural purpose. The first, that the “parts are\npossible…only through their relation to the whole”\n(§65, 373), is a condition on something's being, not only a\nnatural purpose, but a purpose tout court. It thus applies\nnot only to living things but also to artifacts, such as watches, in\nwhich each part is there for the sake of its relation to the whole,\nand is thus in a sense there only on account of its relation to the\nwhole. The second condition, which applies only to purposes which are\nnatural, is that “the parts of the thing…are reciprocally\ncause and effect of their form” (ibid.). (This corresponds to\nthe third of the features to which Kant drew our attention in the\nexample of the tree at §64.) This condition is not met by\nartifacts, a point which Kant illustrates by appeal to the example of\na watch, whose parts, unlike the parts of a plant or animal, do not\nproduce one another or maintain one another in existence. \nKant is concerned, then, to emphasize both an analogy and a disanalogy\nbetween organisms and artifacts. As in the case of artifacts, we can\nmake sense of organisms (that is, understand their structure and\nworkings) only by appeal to teleological notions. We make sense of an\norganism by coming to understand what the functions of its various\nparts are (e.g., by coming to understand that the function of the\nheart is to pump blood round the body, or that the heart is there\n“in order to” pump blood round the body) just as we make\nsense of an artifact such as a watch by coming to understand the\nfunctions of its parts (e.g., that a particular wheel is\nthere in order to turn the hour hand). But organisms are unlike\nartifacts in that they are not produced or maintained by an external\ncause, but instead have the self-producing and self-maintaining\ncharacter that is revealed in the kinds of vital properties\n(reproduction of young, capacity to nourish themselves, reciprocal\ndependence of parts, capacity for self-repair) which Kant illustrates\nwith the example of the tree. \nThe question of how the natural character of organisms can be\nreconciled with their status as purposes, and hence of the very\ncoherence of the notion of a “natural purpose,” is\nindirectly addressed by Kant in the Dialectic of Teleological Judgment\nin the form of a question about how we are to reconcile the apparently\nconflicting demands of mechanistic and teleological explanation with\nregard to living things (see Section 3.4 below).\nBut it can also be raised in a more direct form.  How is it possible\nto regard one and the same object both as a purpose (hence as\nsomething which has been produced as a result of conscious design),\nand as natural (hence — on the face of it — something\nwhich has not been produced as a result of conscious design)?  To say\nthat we regard it only as if it were designed does not on its\nown dispose of the question, for it is not clear what it is to regard\nsomething that is not designed “as if” it were designed:\nif we are not ascribing to organisms the property of being artifacts,\nthen in what respect can we can coherently regard them as similar to\nartifacts? Ginsborg (2001) attempts to resolve the problem of coherence by\nappeal to a conception of purposiveness as normativity\n(see Section 3.1 above), arguing that organisms can\nbe regarded as subject to normative standards without supposing that\nthey were designed to accord with those standards.  Alternative\nsolutions are offered by Kreines (2005), who agrees that the notion of\na purpose has normative content but denies that organisms for Kant are\nin fact purposes, and by Beisbart (2009), who argues that the appeal\nto normativity is unnecessary for making sense of organisms as natural\npurposes, since we can conceive of a natural object as artefact-like\nby conceiving of its parts as produced reciprocally by one another and\nby the whole (in the way illustrated by Kant through the example of\nthe tree at §64). \nWhile much discussion of Kant's biological teleology has focussed on\nthe Dialectic of Teleological Judgment, rather than the Analytic,\nthere is an excellent discussion of the Analytic of Teleological\nJudgment in McLaughlin (1990, ch. 1), which sets Kant's view of\norganisms in the context of eighteenth-century biology.  Other\ndiscussions of the Analytic's treatment of organisms as natural\npurposes include Zumbach (1984), Illetterati (2014),\nŠustar (2014) and Goy (2014a).  Fricke (1990),\nGuyer (2003a) and Steigerwald (2006) relate Kant's view of organisms\nas natural purposes to his views about reflective judgment more\ngenerally. Guyer\n(2001) discusses the way in which Kant's notion of organisms as\npurposes creates a problem for his conception of science as unified.\nBreitenbach (2014) argues that the ascription of purposiveness\nto organisms is a matter of our regarding organic natural processes as\nanalogous to reason's intentional activity. \nThe same considerations which lead Kant to claim, in the Analytic,\nthat we must regard organisms as purposes, lead him to claim, in the\nDialectic, that their production cannot be mechanically explained and\nthat they must instead be accounted for in terms which ultimately make\nreference to teleology. In a well-known passage he declares that it is\n“absurd for human beings…to hope that there may yet arise\na Newton who could make conceivable even so much as the production of\na blade of grass according to natural laws which no intention has\nordered” (§75, 400). The mechanical inexplicability of\norganisms leads to an apparent conflict, which Kant refers to as an\n“antinomy of judgment,” between two principles governing\nempirical scientific enquiry. On the one hand, we must seek to explain\neverything in nature in mechanical terms; on the other, some objects\nin nature resist mechanical explanation and we need to appeal to\nteleology in order to understand them (§70, 387). \nThe question of how Kant resolves the Antinomy is controversial. At\nleast part of Kant's solution consists in the claim that both\nprinciples are merely “regulative” rather than\n“constitutive,” that is, that they do not state how nature\nreally is, but only present principles which we must follow in\ninvestigating nature. Kant develops this solution in detail by arguing\nthat both the need for mechanistic explanation for nature as a whole,\nand the specific need to regard some products of nature (specifically,\norganisms) in teleological terms, are due to peculiarities of our\nhuman cognitive faculties. The core of this argument is given in\n§77, where Kant differentiates two kinds of understanding, the\n“discursive” understanding of human beings, and a\ncontrasting “intuitive” understanding which (although Kant\ndoes not say so explicitly) might be ascribed to God. While a being\nwith a discursive understanding cannot understand how an organism\ncould come about in ways that do not involve teleological causation,\nthis does not mean this could not be understood by an intuitive\nunderstanding, and hence that the production of organisms is\nimpossible without such causation. \nThis argument on its own is not sufficient to address the question of\nhow the principles are to be reconciled in scientific enquiry, that\nis, how we are to seek a mechanical explanation of organisms (as\nrequired by the first principle) while still acknowledging that we\ncannot understand them except by appeal to purposes. Kant's ostensible\nanswer to this question is that we must “subordinate”\nmechanism to teleology (§78, 414). Even in the case of organisms,\nwe must pursue the search for mechanical explanation as far as\npossible, yet while still recognizing the need for an ultimate appeal\nto purposes. The subordination of mechanism to teleology is clarified\nin §§80–81, in the “Methodology of Teleological\nJudgment,” where Kant connects his views to some of the\nbiological controversies of the day, regarding both the origin of the\nvarious species of plants and animals, and the origin of individual\nplants and animals belonging to already existing species. In the case\nof the origin of species, Kant tentatively endorses a view which\nallows the natural development of higher species out of lower ones,\nbut which denies the possibility that the lower species in turn could\ndevelop out of unorganized matter as such. The view is\n“mechanical” to the extent that it understands the\ndevelopment of one species from another as a natural law-governed\nprocess which does not require special appeal to an purpose in the\ncase of each new species; but the mechanism is “subordinated to\nteleology” in the sense that the starting-point of the process,\nnamely matter which itself has organization and life, is intelligible\nonly by appeal to purposes (§80). In the case of the origin of\nparticular organisms, Kant endorses a view (epigenesis) on which the\nemergence of an apparently new plant or animal is not just the\nexpansion or unfolding of one which already existed in miniature (as\non the preformationist view), but a natural process whereby a new\nliving thing comes into being. At the same time, he denies that a\nliving thing can come to be out of non-living matter: the matter from\nwhich the embryo develops must already be teleologically\norganized. The view is “mechanical” in the sense that it\ndenies that each living thing was produced, like an artifact, in\naccordance with a specific intention, and allows instead that once\nmatter is endowed with life and organization it has the power to\nproduce other living things. But again, as in the case of the origin\nof species, this “mechanism” depends on living matter,\nwhose possibility we can understand only in teleological terms. \nIt is difficult to understand the implications of Kant's discussion of\nmechanism and teleology without knowing what he means by\n“mechanism,” and unfortunately this is very hard to\ndetermine from the text. Many commentators have taken the notion of\nmechanism to be equivalent to the notion of causality in time which\nfigures in the Critique of Pure Reason, so that the principle\nof mechanism is equivalent to the causal principle which Kant takes\nhimself to have proved in the Second Analogy. If the notion of\nmechanism is understood in this way, then Kant's solution to the\nantinomy of teleological judgment is radically at odds with his views\nin the Critique of Pure Reason, since it involves the claim\nthat the principle of mechanism is merely regulative as opposed to\nconstitutive. McLaughlin (1989, 1990), and following him Allison\n(1991), reject this reading, instead taking the notion of mechanism in\nthe relevant sense to correspond to a more specific type of causality,\nnamely the causality by which the parts of a thing determine the whole\nrather than the whole's determining the parts; this view is also taken\nby Zanetti (1993). Ginsborg (2001) offers a third proposal, on which a\nthing can be explained “mechanically” if its existence can\nbe accounted for in terms of the intrinsic powers of the matter out of\nwhich it comes to be. \nA related interpretative issue concerns the grounds on which organisms\nresist mechanical explanation, and hence need to be understood\nteleologically.  Many commentators, including McLaughlin (1990),\nAllison (1991) and Guyer (2001, 2003a), take organisms to be\nmechanically inexplicable in virtue of the self-maintaining and\nself-producing character which distinguishes them from artifacts\n(see Section 3.3).  On this approach, organisms\nhave to be explained teleologically because, in contrast to machines,\ntheir parts cannot exist independently of the whole to which they\nbelong.  Against this, Ginsborg (2004) argues that the\nself-maintaining character of organisms is irrelevant to their\nmechanical inexplicability in the relevant sense.  Kant's point in\nemphasizing the contrast between organisms and machines is not to show\nthat organisms require teleological explanation (since machines such\nas clocks are no less in need of such explanation), but on the\ncontrary to show that, as natural objects rather than artefacts, they\nare not to be explained in terms of a designer's intentions.  The\ndisagreement is discussed further in Breitenbach (2006), Watkins\n(2009) and McLaughlin (2014), all of which engage with the more\ngeneral issue of how the Antinomy is resolved.  There is a very helpful overview of the Antinomy in chapter 4 of\nQuarfood (2004) which includes many references to relevant secondary\nliterature.  More recent discussions of the Antinomy include, in\naddition to the articles mentioned in the previous paragraph, Quarfood\n(2006), Breitenbach (2008), Quarfood (2014),\nNuzzo (2009) and Huneman (2014): the latter two articles deal\nspecifically with Kant's distinction between discursive and intuitive\nunderstanding in §§76–77. \nKant is concerned with the role of teleology in our understanding not\nonly of individual organisms, but also of other natural things and\nprocesses, and of nature as a whole. Experience presents us with many\ncases in which features of a living thing's environment, both organic\nand inorganic, are beneficial or indeed necessary to it: for example\nrivers are helpful to the growth of plants, and thus indirectly to\nhuman beings, because they deposit soil and thus create fertile land\n(§63, 367); grass is necessary for cattle and other herbivorous\nanimals, which in turn provide food for carnivores (§63,\n368). Kant makes the negative point (a version of which he had earlier\nargued at length in the Only Possible Argument for the Existence\nof God of 1763) that we can understand these arrangements without\nappeal to purposes. We can account for the origin of rivers\nmechanically, and even though grass must be regarded as an purpose on\naccount of its internal organization, we do not need to appeal to its\nusefulness to other living things in order to comprehend it. However,\nhe does hold that the natural objects figuring in these useful\narrangements have a type of purposiveness, namely outer or relative\npurposiveness. They can be counted as purposive in this relative sense\nas long as the thing to whose existence they contribute is a living\nthing, and hence has inner purposiveness (this condition is stated\nmost clearly at §82, 425). \nThe idea of the outer or relative purposiveness of one natural thing\nfor another, which is made possible by the idea of a natural purpose,\nin turn makes possible the idea of nature as a system of purposes,\nwhere everything in nature is teleologically connected to everything\nelse through relations of outer purposiveness. Kant puts this by\nsaying that the concept of a natural purpose “necessarily leads\nto the idea of all of nature as a system in accordance with the rule\nof purposes” (§67, 379), but he also puts the point more\nweakly by saying that the step from the idea of a natural purpose\nto that of nature as a whole as a system of purposes is one which we\n“may” [dürfen] make (§67, 380). This\ndoes not mean that we are entitled, still less required, to ascribe an\nintentional cause to purposive arrangements in nature, but it does\nallow us to think of them as standing not only in a mechanical, but\nalso in a teleological order. The thought of such a teleological order\nin turn leads to two further ideas: the idea of the ultimate\npurpose [letzter Zweck] of nature, which is something\nwithin nature for whose sake all other things within nature exist\n(§82, 426ff), and the idea of the final purpose\n[Endzweck] of nature, which is something outside of nature\nfor whose sake nature as a whole exists (§67, 378f.; §84,\n434ff.). While experience does not allow us to identify either\nnature's ultimate purpose or its final purpose, Kant argues on a\npriori grounds that the final purpose of nature can only be man\nconsidered as a moral subject, that is, considered as having the\nsupersensible ability to choose purposes freely (§84, 435). To\nconsider man in this way is to conceive him as noumenon, rather than\nas part of nature. But human beings are capable of realizing their\nnoumenal freedom only in virtue of their capacity, as natural beings,\nto set themselves purposes and to use nature to fulfil them. Kant\ncalls the development of this capacity “culture,” and\ntakes it to require the acquisition both of specific abilities\n(“culture of skill”) and of the ability to make choices\nwithout being influenced by the inclinations to enjoyment stemming\nfrom our animal nature (“culture of discipline”). Culture\nis the ultimate purpose of nature because it prepares man for what he\nmust do in order to be the final purpose of nature (§83,\n431). \nFor Kant's views about the teleology of nature as a whole, see Guyer\n(2001a and 2014) and Watkins (2014); the latter offers a\nvery helpful discussion of Kant's justification for the extension of\nhis views about teleology in individual organisms to nature as a\nwhole.  See also Cohen's (2006) discussion of the relation between\nKant's views on the generation of organisms and his conception of the\nfinal purpose of nature. \nPart of Kant's aim in the “Critique of Teleological\nJudgment” is to clarify the relation of natural teleology to\nreligion, and to argue in particular against\n“physicoteleology,” that is, the attempt to use natural\nteleology to prove the existence of God. (The topic of physicotheology\nwas of concern to Kant throughout his career: Kant proposes a\n“revised physicotheology” in the Only Possible\nArgument for the Existence of God (1763), and offers a more\nfar-reaching criticism of physicotheology in the Critique of Pure\nReason, at A620/B648ff.) Appeal to natural teleology may justify\nthe assumption of an intelligent cause of nature, but it cannot\njustify the assumption that this cause has wisdom, let alone that it\nis infinite in every respect, and in particular supremely wise\n(§85, 441). For this we need to appeal, not to natural, but to\nmoral, teleology, and in particular to the idea (itself belonging not\nto natural, but to moral teleology) of man as final purpose of\nnature. The idea of nature as purposively directed towards the\nexistence of rational beings under moral laws allows us to conceive of\nan author of nature who is not merely intelligent, but also has the\nother atttibutes associated with the traditional idea of God, for\nexample omniscience, omnipotence and wisdom (which includes\nomnibenificence and justice) (§86, 444). We have to assume the\nexistence of a being with these attributes if we ourselves are to\nadopt the purpose required by the moral law, a purpose which Kant\ncalls the “highest good” and which is discussed in his\nmoral writings. \nAlthough natural teleology cannot prove the existence of God, it\nnonetheless has a positive role to play with respect to religion and\nmorality, in that it leads us to ask what the final purpose of nature\nis, and relatedly, to inquire into the attributes of God as author of\nnature. Thus, as Kant puts it, it “drives us to seek a\ntheology” (§85, 440), and thus serves as a preparation or\n“propadeutic” to theology (§85, 442). Kant also\nclaims that “if the cognition of natural purposes is connected\nwith that of the moral purpose” then “it is of great\nsignificance for assisting the practical reality of the idea [of\nGod]” (§88, 456). The positive role of natural teleology in\nestablishing religion and morality has been emphasized by Guyer (see\nespecially 2000, 2001a, 2002), who takes the “Critique of\nTeleological Judgment” to provide an important argument from\nnatural teleology to morality. \nA different kind of connection between Kant's natural teleology and\nhis views about morality is suggested in Kain (2009), which interprets\nKant's biological theories as supporting his view that all members of\nthe human species (including infants and the severely disabled) have\nmoral status. Kant's writings on natural teleology take for granted the\nbiological theories of his time, which were very different from those\nof the present day.  While theorists at the time that Kant was writing\nwere prepared to consider the possibility that present-day species\nevolved out of earlier and more primitive forms of life — and\neven out of mere matter as such — they had no inkling of\nDarwin's theory of natural selection, nor of Mendel's laws of\ninheritance.  Moreover, it was widely assumed that living beings were\nmade of a different kind of matter from that found elsewhere in the\nuniverse; and while some biological theorists rejected this\n“vitalist” assumption there was, as yet, no experimental\nevidence against it.  Kant himself follows Blumenbach in assuming a\ndistinctive kind of living matter which can be understood only in\nteleological terms.  It might seem implausible, then, that Kant's\nviews could have any relevance to contemporary biological thought. \nHowever, there are reasons to think that contemporary biological\ntheory is no less committed to teleology than its eighteenth-century\ncounterpart, in particular through biologists' use of functional\nlanguage in their characterizations of the parts and behaviour of\norganisms.  Kant can thus be seen as addressing a problem which is\nalso of concern to present-day philosophers of biology: how to make\nsense of the idea that biological entities and processes can have\npurposes or functions without presupposing the existence of a divine\ndesigner.  A number of interpreters have recently drawn on Kant to\npropose a solution to the problem, although without necessarily\nagreeing on what a Kantian solution amounts to.  Examples of\nexplicitly “Kantian” approaches to teleology include ch. 3\nof Quarfood (2004), Walsh (2006), Cohen (2007), Breitenbach (2009) and\nGinsborg (2014).  McLaughlin's (2001) book on functional\nexplanation, while not explicitly proposing a Kantian approach, draws\non Kant at several points.  A different suggestion regarding the\nrelevance of Kant's views to contemporary biology is offered by Roth\n(2014), who argues that Kant's anti-reductionism regarding\norganisms — that they cannot be understood as composed out of\npre-existing parts — offers a model for contemporary molecular\nbiology.  The view that Kant's theory is relevant to the contemporary debate\nabout biological functions is challenged forcefully by Zammito\n(2006).","contact.mail":"ginsborg@berkeley.edu","contact.domain":"berkeley.edu"}]
