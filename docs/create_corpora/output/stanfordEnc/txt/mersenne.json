At a time when scientific periodicals were still sorely\nlacking, he was rightly referred to as “The Secretary of Learned\nEurope” (“le secrétaire de l’Europe\nsavante”, Hauréau 1877, p. 177) thanks to his\nsprawling correspondence, which extended his network across the whole\nof learned Europe, to his role as translator, editor, disseminator of\nscientific information, and to his ability to generate research and\ndiscoveries by creating “fine questions” (de belles\nquestions, Pascal 1658, p. 1) addressed to the foremost\nscholars of the time. His tireless activity certainly helped to create\na new image of a mathematical, mechanistic and experimental science in\nthe making, based on the exchange of information and co-operation\nbetween European scholars. Part of his fame is also due to his\nlifelong connection to Descartes. From the time the latter settled in\nHolland, Mersenne was his main, and at times unique, correspondent,\nproviding him with rich information on intellectual life, and\nrelentlessly questioning him on philosophical and scientific\nmatters.\n\n\nAlthough these features of Mersenne’s activities (as an animator\nof scientific life and as Descartes’s friend and correspondent)\nare the most well-known, they should not conceal Mersenne’s own\noriginal contribution to philosophy. While his first works were\npolemic in tone, offering “scientific apologetics”\n(Lenoble 1943) using arguments taken from the sciences to defend\nChristian catholic religion against all sorts of heterodox trends\nthreatening it, his latter publications (from 1634 onward), far less\nconcerned with apologetics, illustrated and promoted the new\nmechanical, mathematical, and experimental sciences. A key thread\nrunning through his complex intellectual career, music, understood as\nthe general science of harmonics, received Mersenne’s constant\nattention and was the subject of several important publications.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarin Mersenne was born on 8 September 1588 near Oizé in the\nFrench region of Haut-Maine (nowadays the Sarthe). He came from a\nfamily of merchants and small landowners. After studying at the\ncollege du Mans, he was sent in 1604 to the newly created Jesuit\ncollege of La Flèche, where he received the established Jesuit\neducation, coupling humanist—Ciceronian—and Aristotelian\ntraditions (Dear 1988). He may have met there the young René\nDescartes, who entered La Flèche in 1606, although it is\nunlikely that their friendship started then, as Descartes was 8 years\nhis junior. When he left the college, Mersenne completed his training\nin theology, Greek and Hebrew in Paris at the Collège Royal and\nat the Sorbonne where he was instructed by the Thomist theologians\nFrançois Ysambert and Philippe de Gamache (see Coste 1648;\nArmogathe 1994). Attracted to the strict rule of the Minims, a\nFranciscan order recently introduced into France, he took the habits\nin 1611, and after periods of novitiate and teaching in Meaux, Paris\nand Never, was recalled to Paris in 1619 at the new house on the Place\nRoyale (the present Place des Vosges) where he remained permanently,\napart from a few trips to the French provinces, to the Netherlands in\n1630, and to Italy from 1644 to 1645. \nFrom the years 1620 onward, Mersenne deployed overflowing intellectual\nactivity. Through the mediation of Claude Fabbri de Pereisc whom he\nhad met in 1616, he was introduced to the Parisian intellectual elite,\nand later to Pierre Gassendi with whom he remained close friends. In\nParis, he associated with the mathematician Claude Mydorge, and,\nperhaps through him, renewed acquaintance with Descartes. Mersenne\ncalled on Descartes’s mathematical expertise on questions of\noptics. His questions led Descartes to his first formulation of the\nlaw of refraction, which he was to publish later in his 1637\n“Dioptrics”. Mersenne was among those attending the famous\nmeeting of 1628, at the residence of the apostolic nuncio, where\nDescartes, having revealed his project of founding the sciences on a\nnew method, had been encouraged to do so by the highest religious\nauthorities. After Descartes left for Holland, Mersenne remained in\nclose contact with him through correspondence. He was privy to most of\nDescartes’s secret addresses, which made him the man one has to\nsee in order to get access to the French exile, to send him letters or\nquestions. Only four letters from Mersenne to Descartes are extant,\nbut 146 letters from Descartes—about a quarter of his known\ncorrespondence—testify to the intensity and continuity of the\nexchange. Mersenne endlessly provided Descartes with books, fresh\ninformation, and editorial services, requesting in exchange answers to\nqueries of all sorts. Acting as mediator in Descartes’s\ncontroversies, with Fermat, Roberval, Beaugrand, Morin, or\nVoëtius, he sometimes caused quarrels himself, through his\nindiscretions, such as the one which made Descartes definitively fall\nout with his erstwhile mentor Isaac Beeckman. Mersenne also acted as\nintermediary for the edition of the Meditationes de prima\nphilosophiae, and was instrumental in the gathering of the six\nsets of objections that were added to the text with Descartes’s\nresponses, including those of Hobbes and Gassendi. He contributed\nhimself to the objectiones, penning the second set (“gathered by\nthe R. P. Mersenne from the mouth of various theologians and\nphilosophers”, AT IX-1: 96) and perhaps parts of the sixth. \nMersenne’s dealings with Descartes were only a small part of the\nnetwork of intellectual communication that he built up throughout his\ncareer. He was largely responsible for introducing Galileo into\nFrance, offering in 1630—without receiving an answer—to\npublish his future work on the Two Chief Systems of the\nWorld. In 1634, he published Les Méchaniques de\nGalilée, a free translation of a manuscript on mechanics\nby the Florentine scholar, completed with ideas borrowed from\nGuidobaldo and Stevin, and with original comments of his own, and, in\n1639, the Nouvelles pensées de Galilée, a\ntranslation or adaptation of certain parts of the Discorsi a due\nnuove scienze, published in Italy one year earlier. Mersenne was\nalso in regular contact with English scholars. He translated into\nFrench the De Veritate of Herbert of Cherbury (although the\nbook had been placed in the Index, i.e., the list of prohibited books\npublished by the Catholic Church); in good terms with Hobbes, he\npublished one of his optical treatises, and Sorbière’s\nFrench translation of the De Cive. He corresponded with\nKenelm Digby and Lord Cavendish and others. \nIn Paris, a small scientific circle of mathematicians and physicists\ngradually formed around Mersenne. From 1633 or so, meetings were\norganized on Thursdays at the houses of one or another of his friends\nor protectors. This “Academia Parisiensis”, as it came to\nbe called, brought together men such as Étienne Pascal,\nMydorge, Hardy, Roberval, Fermat. It was later to welcome the young\nBlaise Pascal, and Jacques Le Pailleur who was to become the\ngroup’s leader when Mersenne died in 1648. Discussions were\nmostly “mathematical” (MC V: 209). Mersenne used to submit\nproblems of his own invention to his friends, and some were often\nremarkably stimulating and the origin of important discoveries such as\nthe “roulette” problem, solved by Roberval in 1634; and\nthen more indirectly by Fermat and Descartes. Mersenne himself\nundertook to establish a first list of what will eventually be called\nthe “Mersenne primes”, prime numbers that can be written\nin the form 2n − 1, whose properties and determination are still\ntopical questions in contemporary mathematics. Mersenne envisaged his\nmeeting group, and his own net of correspondents, as the prototype for\na larger institution that would bring scholars together in a pacified\nEurope, foreshadowing the foundation of the later Académie des\nsciences in 1666, or the Royal Society in England (MC V:\n301–302, and Goldstein 2013) \nIn 1623 and 1625, Mersenne published three massive philosophical\nworks. The Questiones celeberrimae in Genesim (which covers\nalmost 1900 folio columns), a commentary on the six first chapters of\nthe book of Genesis, larded with long scientific and philosophical\ndigressions, was intended as an apology of Christian religion against\nall forms of “atheism”. It contains attacks on various\nPlatonist, cabbalistic and hermetic authors such as Bernardino\nTelesio, Pietro Pomponazzi, Giordano Bruno, Jacques Gaffarel, or the\nEnglish hermetic author, Robert Fludd. The tone is virulent, sometimes\noffensive, and the book attracted several outraged answers. Fludd in\nparticular reacted in his Sophia cum moria certamen (1629)\nwhich itself drew a long reply from Gassendi, writing upon\nMersenne’s request (Gassendi 1630). The same inspiration governs\nL’Impiété des Déistes, published\nin French the next year. It is as a point-by-point refutation of the\n106 Quatrains du Déiste or Anti-Bigot, a long\nanonymous poem denouncing Christian revelation, bigoted superstition\nand belief in a personal God. Mersenne’s response, written as a\ndialogue between a deist and a theologian, leads to the conversion of\nthe deist, to whom the existence, justice and mercy of the Christian\nGod are demonstrated. Dedicated to Richelieu, and perhaps written on\ncommand, the book may be seen as taking part in a larger campaign\norchestrated by the French state and the catholic church, at a time\nthat witnessed Vanini’s execution in Toulouse, the trial of\nTheophile de Viau, and a strengthening of repressive measures against\nanti-Aristotelian philosophical novelties. La Vérité\ndes sciences (1625) is a dialogue between an alchemist, a skeptic\nand a Christian philosopher, the latter opposing both the\nover-confidence of the first and the excessive doubts of the second.\nThe second, third and fourth parts of the book, dealing with\narithmetic and geometry, is an 800 page compilation of ancient and\nrecent achievements in the mathematical sciences, intended to show\nthat there are regions of human knowledge immune from doubt, and which\ndo not contradict Christian wisdom. \nBy the end of the 1620s, Mersenne’s former animosity towards the\nanti-aristotelians authors withered, giving way to a more lenient if\nnot tolerant approach.  Galileo whom he had listed among the dangerous\nones in 1623 is now the object of great praise. Mersenne seemed much\nless concerned with the proliferation of atheists and heretics, and he\nexpressed regrets about the offensive tone of his previous works\n(Letter to Rivet 12 nov.  1639, MC X: 599). His travel to Holland in\n1630 put him in contact with Protestant scholars, such as André\nRivet and the Socinian Ruarus, who became regular correspondents.\nMersenne who used to vilify the heretics, was now taken to task for\nhis sympathies with the enemy, and he was sometimes dubbed the\n“Huguenot monk”. In any case the staunch defense of\northodoxy of the first works is nowhere to be found in\nMersenne’s next publications, which, from 1634 onward, are\nalmost entirely devoted to the promotion of the mathematical sciences,\nbroadly conceived. It has been a question among biographers and\ncommentators whether these changes reflect a conversion to a new\nagenda or a new philosophical outlook. Robert Lenoble (1943: 38)\nconsiders that until 1634, Mersenne was still looking for a better\nphilosophy of nature and held provisionally to Aristotelianism,\n“whereas at that date he discovered what he had sought for many\nyears, namely Mechanism”. Sylvie Taussig (2009b) considers that\nMersenne went through a serious crisis, both moral and intellectual,\nat the end of the 1620s, and that under the influence of Peiresc and\nGassendi he came to adopt a more skeptical outlook on philosophical\nand religious matters. Without denying Mersenne’s change of tone\nand accent, Garber (2004) and Dear (1988) tend to underplay the extent\nand meaning of Mersenne’s “conversion” to the new\nphilosophy, considering that his agenda of promoting mixed mathematics\nwas to him still compatible with a traditional philosophical\noutlook—“the learning of the schools”, that Dear\ndescribed as conjoining Christianized Aristotelianism, Renaissance\nhumanism and a skeptical or probabilistic approach to philosophical\nmatters. We shall come back to these issues in due course. \nThe five treatises published in a row in 1634 are representative of\nthe kind of intellectual productions Mersenne would henceforth offer.\nTwo of them (Questions inouyes, and Questions\nthéologiques…) are eclectic lists of\n“curious” questions, intended for entertainment\n(récréation) as well as for instruction of the\nlearned: can one walk on water without miracle? How many grain of\nsands can be contained in the sphere of the earth ? From where does\nthe satisfaction come when one believes one has found a new\ndemonstration or truth? In these questions metaphysical, apologetic\nand even theological considerations are (in spite of the title of the\nsecond treatise) barely present. \nThe Questions harmoniques and the Préludes to the\nharmonie universelle prepare the way for the publication of\nMersenne’s great achievement on musical theory, The Harmonie\nUniverselle (1636–7), where he offers what is still\nconsidered a major contribution to the scientific understanding of\n“consonance” and acoustics. \nFinally the Mechaniques de Galilée illustrates\nMersenne’s constant interest in physico-mathematical questions\nof Galilean type, that is Archimedean mechanics stricto sensu, dealing\nwith basic machines, such as the lever, the wheel, the pulley, but\nalso the sciences of motion, free fall, ballistics, pneumatics,\nhydrostatics, and optics. Mersenne pursued these interests in the\n1640s, when he started to make his own campaigns of experiments in\norder to verify Galilean numerical data on free fall and on the\nvelocity of a cannon ball, especially during his journey to Italy\n(1644–1645) where he met Torricelli. These researches resulted\nin the publication of his Cogitate physico-mathematica (1644)\nand his Novarum observum physico-matheaticarum (1647), which\nincludes in its first part a treatise by Roberval on the system of the\nworld. A book on optics was to be published after Mersenne’s\ndeath (L’Optique et la catoptrique, 1651). \nMersenne was indubitably an heir to the Thomistic view of a necessary\nsynthesis between Christian faith and philosophy. As expressed in the\npraefatium of the Quaestiones in Genesim, it is “a duty\nof the learned to refute atheists”, the tacit assumption being\nthat “true philosophy never contradicts the teachings of the\nChurch” (ID II: 490–1). This synthesis was vindicated in\nthe rather troubled political, and religious context of early\nseventeenth-century France, which still bore the scars of half a\ncentury of religious wars, and appeared exposed and vulnerable to what\nCatholics considered a severe crisis of orthodoxy, raging on all\nfronts. A rising tide of libertines, deists, skeptics, cabbalists,\nalchemists, and naturalist metaphysicians, all more or less\nconsciously in league with the Protestants, seemed to Mersenne on the\nverge of overwhelming the “true” Christian faith. Mersenne\noften pointed out the connection between Protestantism and the various\nforms of heterodoxy and atheism: the Calvinist belief in\npredestination insensibly drives men toward superstition and atheism,\nas it appears more difficult to believe that God wants our damnation,\nthan to represent Him as a “cruel Saturn who devours his\nchildren”, or simply to own that there is no God at all (ID II:\n589). So, Mersenne’s early-interventions may be seen as taking\npart in the larger movement of “re-catholization” of the\nFrench state after the pacification allowed by the Edit de Nantes. In\nthis regard, Mersenne’s advocacy of a harmonious conciliation of\nfaith and reason was not without similarities with a noted feature of\nGalileo’s “cultural program” in the same years: both\nwanted to contribute to the Counter-Reformation, and both defended the\nspecific idea that Catholics should not leave to Protestant heretics\nthe monopoly of reason and scientific knowledge. Mersenne was however\nwary of any anti-Aristotelian philosophical novelties (including those\nof Galileo himself), as he saw them as ipso facto dangerously\nverging towards contesting religious truth. According to Garber\n(2004), the Aristotelian framework, particularly prominent in the\nfirst works, was adopted not so much for its philosophical virtues as\nsuch, but rather as a rampart of orthodoxy, as a tried doctrine, that\nhas long proved its ability to be harmoniously conjoined with\nChristian faith, and as it were to protect it. By contrast,\nalternative ways of thinking offered no such guarantee against heresy,\nas they were often defended with a zeal that was dangerously close to\nfanaticism. As Mersenne stated in the preface to the\nQuaestiones (1623): \nThese men who desire to found a new philosophy, and to demonstrate it\nfrom fundamental principles, never regard the glory of God. Rather\nthey strive with an ignorant obsessive zeal [cacozelia], by\nwhich they seek to shake up and overturn the Catholic religion, if\nthey are able to do it—unless I am mistaken. (QG Praefatio,\ntranslated in Garber 2004: 141) \nThus it seems quite clear that the stakes of a book like the\nQuaestiones were not simply a defense of natural religion but\nalso, and perhaps primarily, a defense of catholic faith (and its\nmysteries) against the caricature conveyed in a growing number of\nwritings, that represented it as resulting from superstition and\nignorance:  \nIt is appropriate to Catholics, and especially to theologians to know\nthe sciences and to scrutinize God’s works, not only because we\nthus receive the meaning of His will as from the pages of a Book, but\nalso because we show how unfounded is the atheist’s\nrepresentation of Catholics as melancholic, agitated with thousands\nscruples and superstitions. (QG: col 2 – translation here and\nelsewhere from the author, unless otherwise indicated) \nTo realize this aim, Mersenne’s strategy was twofold: polemical\nand constructive. On the one hand he attacked his polymorph enemy with\nthe rhetorical instruments of a skilled debater, using the weapons of\nthe adversaries, or making one refute the other (as in the dialogue\nbetween the alchemist and the skeptic in the first book of La\nVérité des sciences). Hermetic authors such as\nRobert Fludd, or cabbalistic Christians such as Giovanni Pico and\nJacques Gaffarel were vehemently denounced, as they availed themselves\nof spurious allegorical interpretations of the Bible. Even when their\nreading of the Bible is not wrong, they are dangerous as they make\npeople believe they can deduce a priori, or through divine\ninspiration, what can only be known a posteriori, through\nrevelation and experience. Heretic tendencies were pointed out in the\ndoctrines of the Alchemists, who, in the wake of Paracelsus’s\nMysterium magnum, tried to give naturalist interpretations of\nChristian mysteries, such as the resurrection or the miracle of\nCreation. Mages, sorcerers, and adepts of esoteric mysteries such as\nthe Rosicrucians prosper on men’s propensity to superstition.\nNaturalist metaphysicians—Bruno, Campanella,\nPomponnazi—who endowed nature with creative powers, verge\ndangerously toward pantheism, casting doubt on creation, on the\ntranscendence and freedom of God. A leading thread in all these\ncriticisms, is the idea that the Catholic belief in miracles and\nmysteries, far from being superstitious, is much more attuned to sound\nreason than the doctrines that are opposed to it. A light knowledge of\nphilosophy may induce some doubts, but the more one knows the\nsciences, the more these Catholic beliefs and mysteries are reinforced\nand may be vindicated against false religion and atheism. A smattering\nof knowledge in optics can for example cast doubt on the truth of\ndivine epiphanies, but a better knowledge of this same science allows\none to exclude the idea that miracles can be illusions caused by\nreflections or refractions and therefore makes more sensible their\ndivine origin (QG: col. 522, 538). This sort of negative argument\nshows that Mersenne’s rationalist defense of religion allows for\ntruths beyond the capacity of men’s reason. In this, Mersenne\nstand explicitly against the deist. Both allowed for “natural\nreligion”, but whereas the deist denounced the superstition and\nanthropomorphism of popular belief, Mersenne reversed the attacks and\ndenounced the far worse anthropomorphism of one who measures God by\nhuman reason: “it is feebleness of the mind, to believe that our\nfinite understandings can comprehend the divine attributes or\nacts” (ID I: 318–9; see also ID I: 669–70, and\nBeaude 1980). This however should not be understood as revealing a\nsecret inclination towards fideism: religion teaches truths which\nsurpass reason, “not in destroying it, but rather in perfecting\nit” (ID I: 680). \nMersenne’s criticisms are based on a careful reading and\nexposition of the adverse doctrines, to the point that Mersenne has\nbeen sometimes taken to task for offering the enemies of religion a\nmuch too complacent advertisement. It has been remarked (Carraud 1994:\n152) that the discourse of others (le discours\nd’autrui) holds a distinctive place in Mersenne’s\nwritings: it is neither dismissed as in Descartes, nor deftly\nre-appropriated as in Leibniz, but rather faithfully produced and\nreported in order to be discussed on its own level and according to\nits own merits. This is the case, for example with the cabbalistic\n“sefirot” and numerological methods which are\npatiently, almost sympathetically, expounded in the\nImpiété. The same holds for Giordano\nBruno’s doctrine. However heretic the man was, his arguments in\nfavor of the infinity and plurality of the worlds (from his De\nInfinito) are not simply dismissed or brushed aside. The\nChristian philosopher reports them quite accurately in the second part\nof the Impiété des déistes, before\nanswering and criticizing them. \nApart from its polemical intent, Mersenne’s “scientific\napologetics” may be seen as articulating a natural theology\ntogether with a “sacred physics” or “sacred\nmathematics”. On the one hand a host of rational\narguments—some of them borrowed from the sciences, some from\ntraditional metaphysics—are brought in to prove God’s\nexistence and demonstrate His attributes. This natural theology is\nwhere Mersenne articulates his main ideas on metaphysics and we shall\ncome back to it in the next part of this article. On the other hand,\nscience is used as an instrument of exegesis. The Quaestiones in\nGenesim contains thus numerous scientific excursuses whose aim is\neither to give a scientific (mainly mathematical) exposition of a\nbiblical content—as when Mersenne “calculates” what\nshould be the size of Noah’s ark, or suggests that our knowledge\nof architecture should help us to see the excellence of the temple of\nSolomon—or to illustrate a Catholic mystery (such as the triadic\nunity of God or the miracle of the Creation) through a mathematical\nanalogy. \nThis edifying use of mathematics is perhaps the hallmark of\nMersenne’s writings. It is still very much present in later\npublications (such as the Harmonie Universelle). The minim is\nliterally fascinated by the almost magical properties of numbers and\ngeometrical figures, where the most surprising and complicated objects\nand properties are generated from the simplest principles. This gives\nhim a general analogy for religious truths. There are “thousands\nof things in the mysteries of faith” that are\n“incomprehensible to the pagan and to a peripatetic\nphilosopher”, but that may be made understood by a\n“Christian Euclid” (un Euclide chrétien) :\nMathematics makes the relation of the infinite to the finite sensible,\nshowing how an infinite motion can be made in a finite space. It can\nthus “explain” the union of the two natures in the same\ndivine person. Although the mathematical point is the humblest object,\n“the minim of geometry” (HU III: Livre de l’Utilité\nde l’Harmonie, 16), it is in a sense the closest to God itself. Both\nare simple, without parts. The point engenders the line and together\nwith the line, the surfaces, and with lines and surfaces the\nbodies. This gives us an insight on how God engenders the son, the son\nand God together, the holy spirit, and then all together the\nuniverse. Unity contains all numbers eminently, as God contains all\ncreated acts and all creatures, etc (ibid. 16-17).  Mersenne also likes\nto suggest mathematical analogies illustrating, or symbolizing moral\nvirtues. Thus, as the height of a triangle is measured by a\nperpendicular line elevated from the basis, the goodness of our\nactions is measured by the righteousness of our intention (“la\ndroite intention”, VS I: 12). Mixed mathematics, optics, music\nand mechanics are also mobilized in the moral use of mathematics. For\nexample: \nmechanics teaches us to live well, either by imitating heavy bodies\nwhich always seek their center in the center of the Earth, just as the\nspirit of Man must seek his own center in the divine essence which is\nthe source of all our spirits, or by maintaining ourselves in that\nperpetual moral and moderate balance which consists of rendering all\nthat belongs to Him first of all to God and then to our neighbor.\n(MC IV: 208–09)  The philosophical value of Mersenne’s apologetics may be\ndifferently assessed. Mersenne seemed to pay little attention to\ncontemporary arguments according to which the Bible is not to be taken\nliterally on questions dealing with nature (see, e.g., Galileo’s\n1615 Letter to Christina). His exegesis indeed offers a rather rough\nexample of what will be later called “concordism”, the\nconception that there cannot be any discrepancy between the teachings\nof the sciences and those of the Bible, taken in the most literal\nsense. However, the most distinctive aspect of Mersenne’s\napologetics, the edifying use of mathematics, although sometimes\nnaïve in its formulations, did have philosophical influence.\nPascal, who does not spare his sarcasm on those who think they can\n“prove God from the course of the moon and the planets”\n(Pascal 1963: 599, fg. 781), is nevertheless quite faithful to\nMersenne’s use of mathematics, when he discusses men’s\ndisproportion and God’s greatness from the mathematical model of\nthe infinite divisibility of space, or from a speculation on the two\ninfinites whose terms are reminiscent of similar passages from the\nImpiété. \nBesides, although Mersenne’s “scientific\napologetics” was primarily conceived as a defense of religion\nagainst “atheists”, where science is only a tool, it\nturned out to be also a defense of mathematical sciences against\nwhoever might think that they are vain curiosity and must be either\nrejected, or at least relativized as inessential knowledge…\nThis is especially manifest in the later works, where Mersenne gave\nfree rein to his passion for mathematical sciences. Whereas natural\ntheology and anti-deistic polemic were no longer dominant themes, he\nstill vindicated the “usefulness” of mathematics, not only\nfor men’s welfare, but for their edifying virtues. In the next\ndecades, one could find similar moves in defense of the\n“usefulness of natural experimental philosophy” in the\nworks of Robert Boyle. \nIn the Quaestiones, Mersenne offered a tripartition of the\ntheoretical sciences: metaphysics considers “trans-natural\nobjects, such as God and the angels, that are actually separated from\nall matter”; doctrinal sciences—that is\nmathematics—deals with objects that are “in truth\nmaterial, but considered abstracted from matter, such as the line and\nthe figure”; natural sciences (physics) considers\n“material things as such, for example the heavens or the\nelements”. (QG: col 92–3). In\nLa Vérité (VS I: 50),\nMersenne suggested that metaphysics, although an abstract science,\nlike logic and mathematics, is nevertheless closer to physics, in so\nfar as their shared aim is to consider “things as they are in\nthemselves”, and not simply things as they appear to our\nsenses—in this both sciences “are rightly called\nsapience”. He was later to revise this coupling, suggesting in\nhis Questions inouïes (QI:\n54) that metaphysics is closer to mathematics, on account of\nthe fact that, contrary to physics, metaphysics and mathematics both\nconsider immutable and eternal objects, and are the only ones among\nthe sciences capable of being really possessed by men here below. \nThe definition of metaphysics given in the Quaestiones is\nstrongly reminiscent of Aristotle’s Metaphysics E1—where\n“prime philosophy” is conceived as strictly concerned with\nthe separated or immaterial substances, thus with the\n“theological” realm. Jean-Luc Marion (1994) pointed out\nthat although Mersenne, in several places, acknowledges formally\nanother traditional object for metaphysics, that is the “ens\nquatenus ens” (the abstracted Being as such, whose science\napplies indifferently to all beings, created or uncreated), he seemed\nreluctant to give this science (that we now call ontology) any\nsubstance. In a striking passage from the Quaestiones,\nMersenne said that “Being” is a name that suits God better\nthan any of the creatures: \nAmong all names “being” is the one that we should ascribe\nto God, rather than all the other ones naming the perfections of\ncreatures… God could justly say “I am all Being, as I\ncontains all things more perfectly than they can contain\nthemselves”. This is why all creatures could say “my name\nis non-Being, or non-entity” (Non Esse, seu non Ens),\nas, according to Plato, truly all things except God have non-being\nrather than being. (QG: col. 21) \nIn later works the specificity of ontology was quickly dissolved into\nlogic on the one hand (an abstract science which shares with ontology\nthe same principle of non-contradiction, see VS\n52–55) and into rational theology on the other hand, the\nscience of immaterial beings and first causes. This dissolution may be\nseen as anticipating Descartes’s own reduction of metaphysics to\n“prime philosophy”, and, according to Marion, this is a\nvery significant (albeit a merely negative one) legacy of\nMersenne’s work to the history of metaphysics. \nThe bulk of Mersenne’s contribution to rational theology is\ncontained in the 700 or so first columns of his Quaestiones in\nGenesim, where no less than 35 proofs of God’s existence\nare reckoned and detailed. The importance of rational demonstration is\ndirectly related to the apologetic project: one cannot simply be\ncontent with the idea that God is immediately known, as this could not\nshut the mouths of the atheists. The encyclopedic turn of the\nrecension is obvious, and Mersenne, ready to use all means available\nto contradict the atheists, was not taken aback by the fact that these\nproofs belong to various, and sometimes adverse, theological\ntraditions. After summoning the consensus of all creatures, and the\nconsensus of all men, Mersenne resorted to cosmological arguments,\narguing, from the contingency of our word, and the contingency of our\nown finite existence, that “it is necessary that something\nexists by itself”. Here Mersenne borrowed from Hugues of Saint\nVictor and Jean Damascene. \nHe also presented at some length the Anselmian argument, arguing that\nexistence should be attributed to God, on account of the fact that the\nvery idea of God (that even the insane atheist should have in his\nmind) obliges us to consider that nothing greater can exist, and that\nexistence in re is obviously a greater thing than existence\nin the mind. Mersenne, who did not mention Aquinas’s criticisms,\nfound the argument “excellent and very pious” (QG:\ncol 37). He also paid much credit to the\nAugustinian argument from “eternal\ntruths”—Mathematical truths in particular would not be\npossible without the supposition of an eternal mind in which they\nreside: \nopen your mind’s eyes, ô atheist, and see how numerous and\nstrong are the arguments through which arithmetic asks you to embrace\nthe divine unity, without which Arithmetic would not hold, as all\nmaterial unity or numerical is impossible without the supposition of\ndivine unity. … One objects to the atheist’s geometry, if\never one listens to Plato who recognizes God from this very science,\nas he said that God never ceases to practice geometry. (QG Praefatio: a2) \nIt is to be noted that the two a priori arguments (from\neternal truths and from the idea of a perfect being) are the only two\nthat are brought in in the Impiété to dispel atheism. In\nthe Quaestiones however more than half of Mersenne’s\narguments were a posteriori ones: from the creation ex\nnihilo, from the beauty of creatures, from the given natural law,\nfrom the harmony of the universe… All allowed lengthy\nscientific excursuses, demonstrating God’s intelligence and\nprovidence through whatever the sciences can show of the order of\nthings. Among these arguments, Mersenne paid only lip service to the\nclassical Aristotelian and Thomist “argument from motion”,\nwhich states that the world needs an immutable first mover, probably\nbecause he is aware that the argument had been used in Paduan\nAristotelianism in order to defend the coeternity of the world and its\nfirst mover. In the other a posteriori proofs, the regressive\nmove from the creation to the creator was not as likely to subject the\ncreator to the creation. \nProminent in the Quaestiones and\nImpiété, rational theology tended to recede in\nimportance in subsequent works. Although in the Quaestiones,\nMersenne had hinted at another work (“perfectum\nopus”) to come, it was never written. After 1624 he became\nmore reluctant to consider proofs of God’s existence, hinting in\nhis correspondence with Ruarus that it might not be possible to give a\ntruly demonstrative one, however sensible and approved by everyone was\nthe truth of God’s existence. His doubts were now on a par with\nthe ones he came to entertain regarding demonstrations in physical\nmatters. In his Questions théologiques, he wrote in a\nsomewhat autobiographical tone, that everyone could see for themselves\nthat: \nfresh from the Philosophy and Theology courses, they used to imagine\nthat they could give a reason for everything, whereas 20 or 30 years\nlater they are compelled to confess that they know no reason that\nsatisfies them and is so evident and certain that they cannot doubt\nit. (QT: 10) \nThis may shed some light on Mersenne’s role in the writing of\nthe second objections to Descartes’s Meditations, where\ndoubts were cast on the demonstrative character of the Cartesian\nproofs of God’s existence, and especially on the ontological\nproof, whose Anselmian version was so much favoured by Mersenne in his\nyounger years. It has been argued (Garber 2001), quite convincingly,\nthat Jean-Baptiste Morin, a member of the Mersenne circle, and the\nauthor of a booklet on God’s existence written in a geometrical\nfashion (Morin 1635) had an important hand in the composition of the\nsecond objections and that he was probably the one who suggested the\nrequest of presenting the Meditations arguments in a geometrical\nmanner. Mersenne, however would have concurred with the reservations,\nimplicit in this demand, concerning Descartes’s claim to the\nhigher certainty of metaphysical demonstrations over mathematical\nones. \nVoluntarism was an important feature in Mersenne’s apologetics.\nAgainst what appeared to him dangerous necessitarian tendencies in\nRenaissance naturalist philosophies, he repeatedly advocated\nGod’s essential freedom in regard His creation. God chooses to\nexert his efficient, transitive causality in whatever way he will.\nThis for instance explains why Mersenne always opposed the idea of an\ninfinite universe. An infinite world, of the kind postulated by\nGiordano Bruno, would be very close to a necessary emanation of God,\nbut it is neither required of God’s infinite power, nor does it\nagree with the nature of a created thing : \nall that is produced is finite but God’s potentia is without\nmeasure. No created object is adequate to it. (QG:\ncol. 435) \nMersenne maintained that God is not constrained by His infinite power.\nAs a free cause, he can chose to create a finite universe: \nwhy would God make a finite world, if He could make an infinite one?\nThe answer is: God did not want to do anything else than what he\ndid—this however will not prevent us from believing He is all\npowerful, as we distinguish in God the work and the will [le faire\net le vouloir]… it is bad reasoning to conclude an\ninfinite effect from an infinite cause when the cause is not acting\nnecessarily but freely. (ID II: 304) \nFor Mersenne the unique perfect egalitarian emanation of God would be\nan action ad intra, that is the action through which God\ncontemplates (and loves) Himself in the persons of the trinity. When\none comes to causality ad extra, such as creation, one has to\ndistinguish (ID II: 311–2) between\ndivine power and divine will. The first contains and addresses\ninfinite possibilities, the second chooses, from among them, a finite\nassortment. \nVoluntarism concerning the nature and laws of creation may appear as\nan important common ground that Mersenne shared with orthodox\n(Thomist) scholasticism, and with Descartes. As Lenoble has shown, its\nassertion was an essential precondition for the establishment of a\nmechanical science, unifying the whole of nature under the contingent\nwill of God, his initial decisions regarding the distribution and laws\nof matter and motion. Mersenne’s voluntarism implies that\nphysics is not about an eternal and immutable object, as God could\nhave ordered the word in various manners and with various laws. This,\nas we shall see, has important epistemological consequences:\nGod’s freedom means that he is not compelled to create things in\nthe simplest fashion. This is evidenced in the reign of the grace,\nwhere one can clearly see that God did not chose the shortest way to\ndispense his grace, as he could have assured our salvation with a\nunique act of his will (cf. Questions Inouïes, p.\n344–5] But this hold as well for scientific truths, and explains\nfor example why Mersenne never considered as decisive Galilean and\nCopernican arguments for the motion of the earth taken from the\nsimplicity of natural order. Mersenne’s point was actually quite\nclose to the argument from divine omnipotence that Pope Urban VIII\nsuggested to Galileo in 1623, and that Galileo, somewhat ironically,\nput in the mouth of Simplicio in the concluding sentences of the 1632\nDialogo: Man cannot presume to know how the world really is,\nsince God could have brought about the same effects in ways unimagined\nby humans (see Galileo, 1890–1909, VII, 488). \nMersenne did not extend his voluntarism to mathematical truths, as\nDescartes did in a rather unconventional way. The confrontation of\nMersenne’s and Descartes’s positions on this theme has\nbeen the object of some discussions in the secondary\nliterature—see especially Marion 1980; Dear 1988; Carraud 1994;\nFabbri 2008. Descartes first assertions on God’s creation of\nmathematical truths appeared in a letter to Mersenne of April 15,\n1630. Descartes enjoined his correspondent to tell everyone aloud that\nthe mathematical truths that Mersenne called eternal were not\nindependent of God, but “have been created by him and depend on\nhim entirely just as do all the other creatures” (Descartes to\nMersenne, April 15, 1630, AT I: 145). God freely\nestablished them, and impressed them in the minds of men, as a king\nwould in his kingdom. The statement seems to have surprised Mersenne.\nThe Minim’s own letters are lost, but this can be inferred from\nthe fact that Descartes in May and June 1630, obviously answers\nrepeated requests for clarification:  \nyou ask me in quo genere causae Deus disposuit aeternas\nveritates [in what kind of cause God has disposed the eternal\ntruths]. I reply to you that it is in eodem genere causae [in\nthe same kind of cause] that he has created everything, that is ut\nefficients et totalis causa [as efficient and total cause].\n(Descartes to Mersenne, May 27 1630, AT I:\n151–2). \nYou ask what necessitated God to create these truths; and I reply that\nhe was free to make it not true that all the radii of the circle are\nequal—just as free as he was not to create the world. (27 mai\n1630, AT I: 152) \nMersenne’s own considerations on the status of eternal truths in\nGod’s intellect explain why he should have had qualms about\nDescartes’s puzzling doctrine (which might amount here to no\nless than making mathematical truths somehow contingent, depending on\nthe arbitrary will of God—even though Descartes himself, who\noften points out the necessity of mathematical truths, never draws\nsuch consequence). Mersenne position seems closer to cardinal de\nBerulle’s, and Augustine’s exemplarism: eternal\ntruths are exemplar ideas present in God’s intellect and\nilluminating our own. They proceed from God’s nature as His\nVerb, but they are not similar to creatures, they are not\n“freely” created. \nWhen Mersenne considers God’s relation to eternal truth he often\nuses metaphors of light and the emanatist vocabulary of\nNeo-Platonism—for example in the Traité de\nl’harmonie Universelle: \nI consider, therefore the divine essence as an eternal and infinite\nsun, which darts an infinity of rays on which depend all our\nperfections: the goodness of God is one of these rays , whence come\nour good inclinations, our virtues and our good works, the other is\neternal truth, whence proceed all our truths and our sciences. (THU:\n59–60, English translation in Dear 1988: 58) \nOr in the Questions théologiques: \nthe sciences are like the rays of divinity, and it is just as\nblameable to try to know them without God, than try to know the nature\nof colours, without knowing the nature of light, which gives them\nbeing and subsistence. (QT:\n202) \nThe kind of causality implied here is a causality ad intra:\neternal truths belong to God’s nature. And in this regard, as\nthey are “formally” in God and so to speak coeternal with\nHim, they should be considered as uncreated and necessitated, as God\nhimself is not free towards His own nature: \nIt is patent that God is entirely free in regard everything that are\ncontained only eminently in him, to produce them or not, as He is\ndriven necessarily to whatever he embraces formerly as these things\nthat are God himself are infinite, eternal, independent. (QG:\ncol 436)  The idea that eternal truths exist necessarily in God, and do not\ndepend on God’s causality was not new, and Mersenne here\nbelonged to a rather well established scholastic tradition. An\noriginal feature of Mersenne’s position however is that he\nconsidered mathematical truths as the very paradigm of eternal truths.\nAs pointed by Dear, this was not a received doctrine. Mathematics used\nto be considered not really worthy of the dignity of true sciences, on\naccount of the inessential nature of their object and the non-causal\ncharacter of their demonstrations. Mersenne, in the wake of Biancani\n(1615) defended the contrary view: mathematics are not only true\nsciences, but the highest among them, because of their\ncertainty. Besides, their demonstrations are truly causal ones, as\nMersenne showed with the example of numbers where unity appears to be\nthe “material cause” and the intellect, conjoining and\ncomposing unities, the “efficient” one (cf. VS II: 284).\nThus mathematics is able to describe the objects that God’s\nintellect considered when He created the world, that is the possibilia\n(Lenoble 1943)—or, better said, mathematics are the sciences of\nthe metaphysically necessary attributes of all things. \nOne important question that has been debated in the literature is\nwhether Mersenne’s position amounts to the idea that\nmathematical truths are truly independent of God. The discussion is\nnot merely about the meaning one is willing to give to the word\n“independent” whether it applies or not to something that\nis included in God’s nature, but it engages deep issues\nin the history of metaphysical thought. According to Marion (1980),\nand Carraud (1994), the very fact that mathematical truths are\nconsidered as forming the essence of God’s intellect means that\nthey do not depend anymore on God’s will. Apparently endorsing a\ndoctrine that he found mentioned in Suárez (1597,\nxxxi.12.40), Mersenne wrote\nin a much discussed passage of the Quaestiones:  \nas other authors say, things are possible per se, independently of any\ncause, in virtue of the necessary connection and non-contradiction of\nterms. (col. 436)  \nGod would be submitted to mathematical truths just as human intellects\nare. He would know them as we know them. This would be the sign that\nthe doctrine of univocity entered Mersenne’s thought, perhaps\nunder the influence of Kepler, in an irretrievable fashion. This is\nalso deemed to explain the striking disappearance of rational theology\nin Mersenne’s writings. Just as metaphysics had been entirely\nexhausted by natural theology in the first works, rational theology\nended up being entirely exhausted by mathematics. The latter are not\nanymore an analogical resource for theology, but indeed they furnish\nthe only possible non-analogical discourse on God, “the hidden\nobject of all mathematical discourse” (Pessel\n1987). As a consequence, Mersenne’s\napologetics no longer needs to appeal to rational theology—the\nmere promotion of mathematical sciences has become the unique, or\nbest, apology of Christian religion. \nPeter Dear criticized Marion’s interpretation as implying\nsomething that he did not find in Mersenne, namely that mathematical\ntruths exist in a kind of platonic separateness, so that God and men\nwould be in the same relation to them, would see them the same way.\nThis would imply that God is no more the author of them than men,\nwhereas in Dear’s view, Mersenne, always firmly maintained that\neternal truths causally depend on God, being true emanations of his\nnature. Accordingly, Mersenne would not so much insist on independence\nbut rather on co-implication and coeternity. Whereas Descartes used to\n \nsee the matter as straight choice between necessary truths holding\nsimply because God knew them (having willed them) or God’s\nknowing them because they are independently true. (cf. Descartes\nà Mersenne 6 mai 1630, Descartes AT I: 149, and Dear 1988: 60)\n \nMersenne, a rather orthodox scholastic on this point, never recognized\nan alternative: both theses should hold together—eternal truths\nare true because God knows them, and God knows them because they are\ntrue. \nMersenne’s attitude towards skepticism was complex, changing\nover time and somewhat ambivalent. In L’Usage de la\nraison—a recently rediscovered booklet from 1623, whose\nauthorship does not seem questionable—one finds arguments\nagainst the vanity of the sciences that are strongly reminiscent of\nthose expressed around the same time by “Christian\nskeptics”, such as Montaigne and Charron, or even Cornelius\nAgrippa, authors whom Mersenne sternly criticized in his next\npublications. Thus, in the “Dedicatory Epistle to Madame de\nVitry”, the Minim suggested that our time is badly employed in\nstudying the sciences, which are plagued with insuperable\nuncertainty: \nwhenever we raise our eyes to the sky or incline it to the earth, we\nmust owe that everything is unknown to us… Who can claim to\nknow the number of the skies, their form, their matter, properties and\naccident? One can even find idle-dreamers Copernicans prepared to deny\nthe motion of the skies… Who can say if Alchemists are right in\ntheir promises. \nThis uncertainty of the “megalocosm” goes together with an\nequal puzzlement concerning the littlest creature of the micro-world,\nas recent microscopes have shown to the eye that “it is pure\nignorance to say that they are deprived of these several organs that\ncan be seen in larger creatures”. Further, (UR:\n37–38) the author condemned Pythagoras,\nArchimedes, the alchemists, the algebraists, etc. for being so much\nattached to their inventions that they forget to think of God, and\neternal glory… \nThe change of attitude in the next published works is striking. On the\none hand, in the Quaestiones and\nImpiété, skepticism was presented as a sequel\nto Calvinism; and the denunciation of human reason found in Charron\nand Montaigne, far from encouraging faith in the mysteries of\nChristian religion, was seen as inclining men towards atheism and\nlibertinism. On the other hand, Mersenne was no longer denouncing the\nsciences indistinctly as vain curiosity, his general attitude towards\nspeculative enquiry was much more positive, especially when one came\nto the mathematical sciences, whose apologetic virtues he wanted now\nto reveal. He maintained however that our reason is weak,\ncontradictory, particularly in regard philosophical (i.e., physical)\nissues: \nif our reasons were not deceitful, how would it come that there is not\nany one question in Philosophy, that does not raise diverse opinions\nwholly contrary on the same subjects, all of which have their reason\nand nevertheless there is only one that is true. (ID\nII: 672) \nIn La Vérité des sciences contre les sceptiques et\nles phyrroniens, the tone changed again. Skepticism was no longer\ncondemned as a seed of heterodoxy but only in so far as it discourages\nmen from the practice of mathematical sciences. The skeptical\ncharacter is obstinate, but he is no atheist nor heretic in the\ndisguise (see Descotes, in VS, Introduction),\nand in the first part of the book, his arguments against the\nalchemist’s dogmatism are often endorsed and even reinforced by\nthe Christian philosopher. \nAgainst the epistemological optimism of the alchemist who considers\nhimself to be in possession of the perfect science, the skeptic\nresorts to the traditional arguments of the academic school,\nemphasizing that certainty is nowhere to be found, as we have only a\nvery partial and superficial knowledge of things. We perceive only the\neffects and not the profound nature nor the ultimate causes of things.\nThe true essences evade us. The simplest objects (such as a sheet of\npaper) cannot be completely known, because of the infinite number of\nrelations in which they are involved with other elements of the\nuniverse. It has been shown by G. Paganini that these arguments and\nexamples are almost verbatim borrowed from the “second\ndoubt” of Campanella’s Metaphysica, a manuscript\nthat was into Mersenne’s hands at the time he wrote La\nVérité des sciences, but that he did not mention as\nhis source (Paganini 2005 & 2008).  \nIn chapter 11 and 12, the Christian philosopher presents the skeptical\narguments in a new and more radical form. He gives an account of the\nten skeptical tropes of Aenesideme, as Mersenne could have read them\nin Sextus Empiricus and Diogène Laertius. These tropes draw on\nthe varieties of animal constitution in regard pleasures and pains,\nthe idiosyncrasy of men, the disagreement of the senses, the varieties\nof circumstances and dispositions, such as health and disease, sleep\nand wakefulness, young age and old age. All show that the information\nof our senses is unreliable, just as the reasons we draw from\nthem. \nIn answer to these doubts, Mersenne’s Christian philosopher\nresorts to an eclectic strategy. On the one hand, he adopts the usual\nAristotelian standpoint against skepticism regarding the senses: sense\nperception is trustworthy, provided that its exercise takes place in\n“normal” and appropriate conditions. Errors occur only\nwhen the senses are affected by disease, or presented with objects\nwhose distance, illumination, intensity, etc. exceed the normal\nrange: \nAll the deceptions of senses that you object are of no use, for they\nonly prove what we concede, namely that each one of our senses, in\norder to judge its object rightly must have all that its nature and\nthe perfection of its operation require—this granted, it never\nerrs. (VS I: 15) \nOn the other hand, just as senses are the right judges of their own\nproper sensible—the eye of color and light, the ear of sound,\netc.—human intellect also possesses an internal criterion which\nallows it to judge its own objects rightly. It has the use of “a\nspiritual and universal light that it has of its own nature since the\ncommencement of its creation” (VS:\n193). Here the inspiration is clearly Augustinian, as it is for\nDescartes’s parent conception of “lumière\nnaturelle”. The light of the soul does not give men direct\naccess to divine knowledge, knowledge of essences, as that would\nrequire an eternal glory and a supernatural light. But it still gives\naccess to a number of evidentia, immediate certainties, whose\ntruth, Mersenne concedes, depends on God’s illumination and\nGod’s veracity. Thus, in every realm of knowledge or human\ninterests, there are truths that are not capable of doubt, such as\n“the whole is greater than the part”, or “evil\nshould be avoided”. \nAnother Augustinian aspect of Mersenne’s defense is the idea\nthat doubt itself can be turned into a source of knowledge. For\nexample, although there are differences in apprehension between\nvarious men, or between men and beasts, we do have the knowledge of\nsuch differences and this is something that cannot be doubted:\n“at least one knows that the objects of the senses appear\ndifferently according to the diverse dispositions of the organs”\n(VS: 193). Awareness of this sort of facts is\nwhat incites men to seek the laws of appearances—for example,\nthe optical and geometrical rules that govern variations in\nperspective. In other terms, it prompts them to engage into\nphysico-mathematical enquiries. \nOn a similar line of argument, one could say, following Augustine in\nDe Civitate Dei (1998, chapter XI, 26) that one cannot doubt\nthat one doubts, unless admitting an infinite regress: \nI do not believe you doubt that [that we can learn science, with great\ncontentment] because you experience this every day in yourself, and if\nyou doubt it I ask whether you know that you are doubting; if you know\nit, you must know something, and consequently you do not doubt\neverything; an if you doubt that you doubted, I shall force you to\nadmit infinite regress, which you say you reject, so that wherever you\ngo, you must confess that there is some truth, and consequently you\nmust say farewell to your Pyrrhonism. (VS I:\n204) \nIn the next decade, reacting to the cogito argument in the\nDiscours de la Méthode, Mersenne pointed out to\nDescartes how close his use of radical doubt was to that Augustinian\nargument (see Gouhier 1978). \nRichard Popkin has remarked that the great originality of La\nVérité des sciences resides not so much in its\narguments against the skeptics, as in the fact that this defense of\n“the truth of the sciences” concedes so much to the\nskeptical outlook. Most of the skeptical claims that are propounded\neither by the skeptic or by the Christian philosopher are not really\nrefuted in the book. They are integrated in a novel view of what one\nshould expect of scientific enquiry, its true aims and prospects\n(Popkin 1956, 2003). \nThus, the Christian philosopher has no qualm with the skeptical\nrebuttal of the alchemist’s claim to perfect knowledge in\nnatural matters. He freely admits that we cannot know everything, and\nespecially not the causes nor essences of physical things, that\nmen’s capacity is limited by outward appearance and the surface\nof corporeal things. In the Questions inouïes, Mersenne\nwent as far as to say that we cannot demonstrate the existence of the\nexternal world: \nAnd we do not have any demonstration by which we are able to persuade\nthe opinion of those who might maintain that the earth, the water, the\nstars, and all the bodies which we see are but appearances and\n“species intentionales”, supposing God might use these\nspecies or accidents to make all that we see appear to us. For one is\nnot able to say that one knows a single thing as one\nshould—according to the laws and the notions which Aristotle and\nother philosophers give of science—if one cannot demonstrate\nthat it is impossible that the reason which one supplies, or the thing\nwhich one proposes, be not true. That is enough to persuade those who\nuse reflection that there is nothing certain in physics and that there\nare so few certain things, that it is difficult to propound\nany… (QI XVIII: 53, translated in Mace 1970: 24–25) \nMersenne joins the skeptic in his condemnation of the\nAristotelian’s far too optimistic view of science. What is\ndenounced is not so much Aristotle’s physical doctrines or\nmethods (the Christian philosopher, for example, does not endorse the\nskeptical attacks against syllogistic) but rather a mistaken\nrepresentation of the epistemic aims of physics, which cannot aspire\nto perfect certainty. Bacon’s experimental method received no\nmore favor in his eyes precisely on this account, as it serves a\nproject that is no less dogmatic (see Buccolini 2013): \nalthough one may anatomize, and dissolve bodies as much as one wishes,\nwhether by fire, by water, or by the force of the mind, one will never\narrive at the point of rendering our intellect equal to the nature of\nthings. That is why I believe that Verulam design is impossible.\n(VS 212) \nMersenne did not think that our inability to understand the ultimate\ncause and intimate nature of things should be an object of lament. The\nmere knowledge of effects and appearances might be enough for human\nneeds. For one thing, it has enough pragmatic virtue, as it can serve\nus as a guide in our actions. Besides, as outwards appearances, crust\nand superficies may be rigorously described, through measurement and\nmathematics, the sort of knowledge that can be gained here is as\nperfect and certain as one could wish—although not of the sort\ndogmatic physicians and metaphysicians are seeking. \nThus, according to Richard Popkin, Mersenne is not so much refuting\nskepticism as he is adopting an attenuated form of it. By openly\ndiscarding research on the causes and essences of phenomena, reducing\nthe whole of physical science to mathematical knowledge of accidents,\nthe study of external effects, and the establishment of the laws of\nappearances, he invents a “mitigated skepticism”, that\nPopkin considers as the first lucid expression of the modern\nscientific outlook, deemed to become dominant in the following\ncenturies. This outlook conjugates an entire confidence in the virtues\nof physico-mathematical sciences, with a complete positivism (that is,\na deliberate abstention) in regard metaphysical matters.  \nRecent reappraisals of Mersenne’s epistemological views tend to\nqualify Popkin’s characterizations. According to Garber (2004),\nMersenne’s epistemological frame is old rather than new. The way\nhe envisions the boundaries between disciplines remains Aristotelian,\nand in particular his conception of the\n“physico-mathematical” sciences directly comes from the\nAristotelian definition of mixed or subaltern mathematics, sciences\nsuch as astronomy or optics, only dealing with accident and surface\nproperties of physical things. Far from offering a scientific\nsubstitute to Aristotelian physics, these sciences allow one to\napproach nature in a mathematical way “without having to\nchallenge the full complex of Aristotelianism directly” (2004:\n157) in ways that would be perceived as subversive of true religion\nand social order. \nDear’s study (1988) similarly insists on the deliberately\n“un-revolutionary” character of Mersenne’s\ncontribution to the “scientific revolution”. Mersenne\nnever chose to range himself against Aristotelianism, never cast\nhimself as an innovator. His agenda is formulated in a preexisting\nphilosophical idiom (the “language of the schools”), and\nhis ideas display a “borrowed coherence” rather than an\nintrinsic one. Mersenne was not a positivist avant la lettre;\nhe admitted that God knows what man cannot verify, that natural kinds\nexist in nature, that things do have essential definitions. His\n“skeptical” approach to physics is not so much a\nwatered-down Pyrrhonism intended to show the inconclusiveness of\nnatural philosophical demonstration, as it is an instrument to\nrecommend mathematical sciences as an anchor of certainty, where\nordinary natural philosophy stays in doubt and can only be defended in\na probabilistic way. When Mersenne confesses that many questions\ncannot he determined, he is not proposing to suspend judgment but\nrather to formulate a probable judgment by choosing the most\npersuasive opinions. This “probabilism” is, according to\nDear, a legacy of humanist and Ciceronian dialectics, and it remained\nconstantly present in Mersenne’s work, even though, on some\nquestions the weight of probabilities has changed. This was\nparticularly the case for the Copernican opinion. Judging it very\nunlikely in L’Usage de la raison and in the\nQuaestiones, Mersenne eventually recognized that it was the\nopinion best suited to the phenomena observed and therefore the most\nprobable. However, God’s freedom being never constrained,\nMersenne could accept with relative equanimity the final judgment of\nthe Church. In his Questions théologiques, he was to\npublish a French translation of the inquisitorial condemnation and of\nGalileo’s abjuration. \nAccording to Lenoble (1943), Mersenne’s mature works, focusing almost\nexclusively on “physico-mathematical” sciences, witnesses\nthe “birth of mechanism”. However, as the term is not an\nactor’s category of the 17th century, one should be careful in\nits use. Formulated in its own terms, Mersenne’s standpoint\nregarding explanations in physics is that we can only understand what\nwe can do: \nwe only know the real reasons for things that we can create with our\nhand and our mind; … and of all the things made by God, we\ncannot create any, no matter how much subtlety and effort we apply.\n(NO: 8) \nThis indicates both the foundations and limits of mechanistic\nexplanations: finding reasons means showing how things can he produced\nby mechanical actions—actions of the kind we are capable of when\napplying our bodies to external bodies. On the one hand, however, this\nmode of genetic explanation can provide only a very superficial\nclarification of created things, whose construction and complexity are\neither infinite, or go to details and minutiae that our senses are\nincapable of perceiving (OC: 89). On the\nother hand, these explanations cannot bear the character of necessity\nsince they focus on objects that are fundamentally contingent and\nwhose inner machinery could have been constituted differently, had God\nso wanted: \none knows all but nothing in physics, if one follows the definition of\nscience Aristotle gave; for if it ought to be about eternal and\nimmutable objects, and God can change everything that is in physics,\none cannot make a science of it. (QT: 9) \nThe conjoined effects of Mersenne’s epistemological pessimism\nand metaphysical voluntarism make his version of\n“mechanism” very different from the Cartesian, Hobbesian\nor Gassendist one. He never conceived mechanical explanations as a new\nscience of “causes”, based on the adoption of new\nprinciples and elements intended to take the place of Aristotelian\nsubstantial forms—such as Descartes’s subtle matter or\nGassendi’s atoms. Mechanics, as all other mixed-mathematics, was\nsimply concerned with establishing the laws of phenomena. \nThis reflection on nature and the limits of mechanistic science was\naccompanied by truly experimental activity. Mersenne was convinced\nthat mathematical sciences of nature cannot settle for common and\nvague observation. It urgently required “well-controlled and\nwell-performed experiments” (HU I:\n167), facts that were artificially generated and precisely\nmeasured. Mersenne was aware that, even when rigorously performed, an\nexperiment is not always enough to establish the law of phenomena: two\nseries of experiments can diverge very little and yet express very\ndifferent laws. Measurement can only be approximated, and this has a\nbearing on the certainty of mixed mathematics, which is partially\ncompromised to the extent that it deals with physical objects. Reason\nmust therefore, as far as possible, always accompany and discipline\nobservation, without which one is vulnerable to considerable\nmisunderstandings. \nMersenne made a considerable effort to do and redo experiments that\nhis predecessors (most notably Galileo) had not always had the sense\nto present precisely. Thus, on the subject of the increase in speed\nduring falling motion on an inclined plane, he conducted a precise\ncampaign of measurements that enabled him to criticize Galileo’s\nnumerical results, and eventually express doubts on the validity of\nthe law itself (Palmerini 2010). As usual, he expressed his\nreservations concerning our capacity to determine with certainty the\ncauses of gravity: “it is just as difficult to find the real\ncause as to demonstrate whether the earth is stable or mobile”\n(Traité des mouvements) and he placed back-to-back the\nreasons put forward by his contemporaries—positive and real\nquality, air pressure, magnetic attraction—which could only\npartially account for the phenomenon in its precise numerical\ndimensions. As Peter Dear has shown, Mersenne’s approach to the\nscience of motion was inductive in nature, not centered, as it was in\nGalileo, on the abstract physical process, but rather on “a\ngeneralized description of cases, whose details and precise parameters\nheld an importance altogether lacking in Galileo” (Dear 1994). \nOf all the mixed-mathematical disciplines in which Mersenne took an\ninterest, music was undeniably the one to which he devoted the most\neffort and passion. His 1623 Quaestiones already included a\nlong musicological digression on the therapeutic power attributed to\nthe music of the Hebrews, and generally to the music of the Ancients,\nwhose harmonics he dreamed of restoring. The idea was taken up and\ndeveloped in the 1627 Traité de l’harmonie\nuniverselle, published under the transparent pseudonym of\n“Sieur de Sermes”. The science of intellectual music and\nthe understanding of the proportions that govern nature, lost through\nnegligence, must be restored and linked to the science of\n“sensual music”, which addresses our hearing but which,\nseparated from the former, is no longer able to fulfill its true\nfunction: elevating the senses above material objects, rather than\nlinking them together. Mersenne’s great work on musical theory,\nthe eight books of Harmonie Universelle, was published from\n1636 to 1637. It presents a great many editorial variants, as Mersenne\nnever ceased to work on it, annotating his own copy. The important\n“Traité de la nature du son”, which constitutes the\nfirst part of the work, focuses on the study, undertaken in a\nmechanistic spirit, of acoustic quantities, their physical nature and\ntheir effects on physiology and passions. Mersenne, drawing on Isaac\nBeeckman, establishes experimentally the laws connecting the\nvibration, the length and tension of the strings, making an important\ncontribution to acoustic science. \nEpistemological, metaphysical and aesthetic aspects are intertwined in\nMersenne’s musical agenda. Music was to Mersenne a\nmixed-mathematical science, just as astronomy, whose primary aim was\nto “save the phenomena” through more or less plausible\nhypotheses. The musical phenomena par excellence is\n“consonance”, that is the fact that certain sounds put\ntogether are agreeable to the ear. Recent musical practices, new\ninstruments and polyphonic music had disclosed new modes of consonance\nthat were previously unknown, and Mersenne saw his proper task in an\neffort to find the best physico-mathematical hypotheses that would be\nable to account for them, and could be used to invent more\n“perfect” musical pieces (chants). Seeking such\nhypotheses, Mersenne relentlessly asked his correspondents how they\ncould account for the fact that certain sounds put together are\nagreeable and others not. For example, in November 1627, he asked a\ncorrespondent in Rome: \nIf the said Galileus be at Rome or if you should know some other\nexcellent mathematician-musician, I pray you to find out from him why,\nof all the sounds put together, only those which form the octave, the\nfifth, the third, and the sixth and their replicas are agreeable to\nthe ear, and which of all the dissonances is the most disagreeable one\nand why. I have been told that the said Galilei knows this reason.\n(MC I: 603, translated in Mace 1970: 8) \nMersenne’s own general hypothesis was that consonance was due to\nthe coincidence of the vibrations of the air, which itself depended on\ncertain exact ratios in the mechanical properties of the instrument,\ne.g., the length, tension and breadth of the strings). However, as\nconsonance was judged by the ear rather than directly by reason,\ndiscrepancies were found. For example, experiments showed that the ear\nhears an octave when the tensions of the strings are in a ratio of 1\nto 4.25, whereas the physico-mathematical, Pythagorean, hypothesis\nprescribed 1 to 4. So here one would have to find ways to correct, or\n“discipline” experience through reason, in a move that is\nquite typical of Mersenne’s epistemology (see Dear 1988). \nIn spite of those discrepancies, Mersenne was truly fascinated by the\nfact that the human mind, in its musical appreciation, is so to speak\nattuned to mathematical harmonies. The perception of consonance\nalthough mediated (and perhaps distorted) by our feeling, is not mere\nsensual pleasure, as Descartes, for example, seemed to think. Properly\nunderstood, it has a rational dimension, as it discloses to men the\n“universal harmony”, the underlying mathematical order\nthat is present at every level of reality, and that connects them\ntogether. Mersenne could have found in Kepler’s Harmonices\nmundi the idea of such an archetypal harmony, ordering each level\nof reality, and innate to the human mind. He did not accept however\nKepler’s rather dismissive view of music, which had led him to\ndefine harmonics in purely geometrical terms, stripped from whatever\nis sensorial and “acoustic” in it.  Contrary to what is sometimes held, the seeming adoption of an\nintegral mechanism in the last musical works is no renunciation of the\nmetaphysical consideration in harmonics. According to De Buzon (1994:\n127, my translation), the causes and effects of consonance are indeed\ntreated physically, but the pleasure taken to harmonics, “albeit\nan ordinary experience, is a phenomenon that is entirely\ntheological”.  Musical pleasure shows both our destination and\nour state in this world. It raises us to the contemplation of the\ndivine unity, which is so to speak embodied in musical unison: \nconsonances depend on the unison as lines on the point, number on\nunity, and creatures on God. That is why the more they approach it the\nsweeter they become; because consonances have nothing sweet nor\nagreeable but that which they borrow from union of their sounds, which\nis the greater as it approaches unison. (HU II: Livre Premier des consonances, \n15, translated in Mace 1970: 13) \nBut musical pleasure also reveals our imperfect and sensuous nature.\nThus, for instance, although “unison” is the simplest and\nmost divine harmony, we tend to prefer in this world other, less\nperfect consonances and even dissonance. \nIn considering the general interconnection of sciences, Mersenne\ngranted music an almost architectonic function.  All the sciences\nborrow something from each other. As manifested in the encyclopedic\ncharacter of the Harmonie Universelle, music was for Mersenne\nas the connecting principle of the various disciplines, allowing for\ntheir exposition. A thorough investigation of musical properties\nrequires forays into theology, moral philosophy (the passions of the\nsoul), optics, arithmetic and geometry, and of course mechanics as\nsounds are motions of the air, that have to be accounted for in a\nmechanical way.  Conversely, and at a deeper level, music may be seen\nas a total science, theoretically capable of representing the\nproportions that exist between all parts of the mechanical\nuniverse: \nit is also easy to conclude that one can represent everything in the\nworld and, consequently all the sciences, by means of Sound; for,\nsince everything consists in weight, number and measure, and sounds\nrepresent these three properties, they can signify anything one\nwishes, excluding metaphysics. (HU 1: 43) \nIn particular music may teach men how, through motions, objects\ncommunicate their properties to the senses, which themselves are like\ninstruments, more or less well attuned to the external motions of the\nsensible. Music would then become the general science of the\nproperties of the sensible, a kind of general aesthesis uniting mixed\nmathematics in one universal science, whose acquisition would make our\nelevation to the consideration of the first cause easier (QT:\n161).","contact.mail":"philippe.hamou@hotmail.fr","contact.domain":"hotmail.fr"}]
