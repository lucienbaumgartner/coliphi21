The original arguments were\narticulated by the British idealist philosopher F. H. Bradley, who, in\nhis work Appearance and Reality (1893), outlined three\ndistinct regress arguments against the relational unity of properties.\nBradley argued that a particular thing (a lump of sugar) is nothing\nmore than a bundle of qualities (whiteness,\nsweetness, and hardness) unified into a cohesive\nwhole via a relation of some sort. But relations, for Bradley, were\ndeeply problematic. Conceived as “independent” from their\nrelata, they would themselves need further relations to relate them to\nthe original relata, and so on ad infinitum. Conceived as\n“internal” to their relata, they would not relate\nqualities at all, and would also need further relations to relate them\nto qualities. From this, Bradley concluded that a relational unity of\nqualities is unattainable and, more generally, that relations are\nincoherent and should not be thought of as real.\n\n\nIn the decades since its original formulation by F. H. Bradley,\n“Bradley’s regress” has come to refer to a wider\nvariety of arguments. This diversification has happened in two main\ndirections: (i) with respect to the ontology that the argument targets;\nand (ii) with respect to the argument-type presented. (i)\nBradley’s original arguments targeted a one-category ontology of\nqualities, where by “qualities” Bradley seemed to have in\nmind unrepeatable particularized properties or tropes. The\nsame argument form, however, has been used against the one-category\nontology of qualities conceived as multiply occurring universals, as\nwell as against the two-category ontology of particulars and\nuniversals. In fact, one of the most commonly cited versions of\nBradley’s regress in contemporary ontological debate challenges\nthe possibility of appealing to relations to unify particulars (such\nas electrons, apples, chairs) with their respective property\nuniversals (negative charge, roundness,\nblackness). The argument aims to show that any appeal to a\nrelation R (of instantiation, exemplification, etc.) to relate\na particular a with its universal F will require a\nfurther relation R′ to relate the particular a,\nthe universal F, and the relation R; and so on ad\ninfinitum. (ii) In contemporary literature,\n“Bradley’s regress” has been associated with a\nnumber of arguments and problems that are not, in the way they are\nposed, strictly regress arguments. Some of these take the form of the\ngeneral problem\nabout unity, i.e., the question of what is the ontological\nground of the unity of a bundle of tropes/state of affairs as opposed\nto the sum/list/set of their constituents. Others are after an\nexplanation of how relations relate, i.e., the question of\nwhat it is about relations that makes them apt to relate distinct\nrelata. Still others are after an explanation of the\nexistence of specific unified complexes, i.e., the question\nof what makes it the case that a number of constituents of the right\nkinds are actually connected so as to form an existing\nfact/state of affairs/bundle of tropes.\n\n\nIn the face of these Bradleyean arguments, philosophers have had a\nvariety of replies. Some have opted for a rejectionist route\nwhich involves questioning the very assumptions that Bradley’s\narguments make and consequently refusing to reply to the arguments as\nstated (for instance, Russell, Blanshard, Alexander, and Grossman have\nargued that it is a job of relations to relate and that\nBradley’s relational regresses cannot get started if\nrelations’ relating role is taken seriously). The majority of\nphilosophers, however, have accepted some form of the Bradleyan\nargument and replied in one of the following ways: 1) by appealing to\na non-relational tie to relate the relata (Bergmann, Strawson,\nArmstrong); 2) by invoking external relations in possession of some\nspecial features which make them better apt to relate their relata\n(Meinertsen, Vallicella, Maurin, Weiland and Betti); 3) by describing\na special sort of mutual inter-dependence of the would-be relata\n(Frege, Baxter, Simons, Perovic); 4) by claiming simply that the\ncomplex entities themselves (such as states of affairs or facts) act\nas unifiers of their own constituents (Olson, Armstrong); and 5) by\narguing in favor of the benign nature of an infinite regress\n(Armstrong, Orilia).\n\n\nThis entry starts with a historical background of Bradley’s\nregress arguments. Section 1 opens with an outline of some of\nthe historical precursors of Bradley’s regress arguments in\nancient, medieval, and modern philosophy. It then presents in some\ndetail the regress arguments as they were formulated by Bradley in\nAppearance and Reality (1893), as well as Bradley’s\nlater concerns with complexes and relations. Section 2\ndiscusses the two types of extensions that Bradley’s regress\narguments have undergone—with respect to the ontology that they\napply to, and with respect to the exact sort of problem in view.\nSection 3 presents six common types of replies that can be\nfound in the literature surrounding Bradleyean problems. And\nSection 4 concludes by describing some of the recent\napplications of the regress arguments in the literature on grounding,\ncomposition of objects, and unity of the proposition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most notable ancient regress argument that is associated with\nBradley’s is found in Plato’s Parmenides 132a-b.\nTherein Plato presents an argument that has come to be knows as the\nThird Man Argument (TMA), which challenges an explanation of\nsimilarity between distinct particulars that appeals to forms.\nFollowing Vlastos (1954), the regress can be reconstructed as\nexhibiting the following structure: \nIt is commonly assumed that at least three theses underlie this\nargument. The first one is “the one over many” which\nstates that many things having L in common must be explained by\nthe existence of the form L that all of them participate in.\nThe second premise is implicit and it has been called the premise of\n“non-self explanation”; it simply assumes, that in\nexplaining what a, b, c and L have in common one\ncannot appeal to the L itself, but needs to appeal to a\ndifferent form of largeness,\nL1. The third premise which is implied\nin this argument is “the self-partaking” premise; it\nassumes that the form L is itself L, i.e., that the form\nof largeness is itself large. \nIt has been debated at great length amongst the Plato scholars whether\nthe Third Man Argument is to be understood as a metaphysical or as an\nepistemic argument, an argument about the postulated entities or an\nargument about what is involved in our knowledge of them. (For an\nentry point on literature concerning the Third Man Argument, as well\nas the dialogue more broadly see SEP’s entry Plato’s\nParmenides). Similarly, there has been much disagreement about\nwhich of the theses that underlie the TMA Plato was willing\nto give up in order to avoid the regress. To a modern reader the\n“self-partaking” premise seems like an obvious candidate,\nsince it is quite odd to think that the form of largeness is itself\nlarge, the form of smallness itself small, etc. \nPlato’s TMA featured prominently in Aristotle’s\nPeri Ideon, and was later picked up and discussed by medieval\nphilosophers. For instance, Boethius in his Second Commentary on\nPorphyry’s Isagoge discusses a peculiar infinite regress\nthat could be seen to echo TMA, though it is described as an\ninfinite series of genus ascriptions. (See Spade (1994: 22) for an\nEnglish translation of the text). \nHenninger (1989) has individuated arguments by certain orthodox Muslim\ntheologians, the Mutakallimun, that seem to resemble closely\nBradley’s regress. Apparently they believed relations to be\npurely subjective, and argued that positing relations as\nmind-independent entities would lead to an infinite regress. According\nto Henninger (1989: 110), a version of this argument can also be found\nin Harclay, Ockham, and Aureoli. \nPerhaps the closest precursor of Bradley’s regress arguments is\nto be found in Leibniz. Mugnai (2010) has drawn attention to and\ntranslated the following passage from a text dated “December\n1676” written during Leibniz’s stay in Paris: \nAs we will see shortly, this passage very closely resembles the first\nof the three regresses discussed by Bradley (1893). \nBradley’s original formulation of the regress arguments can be\nfound in chapters II and III of his Appearance and Reality\n(1893). Bradley starts the discussion in chapter II on\n“Substantive and Adjective”, by taking as an example a\nlump of sugar. He notes that there appears to be such a thing\nas a lump of sugar and this thing appears to have qualities\nsuch as whiteness, sweetness, and hardness.\nBut—asks Bradley - what is this “thing” that bears\nproperties? On the one hand, he thinks it is odd to assume that there\nis something to the lump of sugar beside its several qualities, thus\nimplying that postulating a property-less bearer of properties is\nincoherent. On the other hand, he notes that the lump cannot merely be\nits qualities either, since the latter must somehow be united. For\nBradley, unity or “coexistence” of qualities presupposes\nrelations, which is why he next turns to examine different conceptions\nof relations. \nOne at a time, Bradley examines relations conceived as attributes of a\nsingle thing; relations conceived as attributes of two or more terms;\nand relations conceived as entirely “independent” of their\nrelata. \nThe trouble with the conception of relations as attributes of a single\nthing or attributes of two or more things comes down, for Bradley, to\nthe more general problem of predication. The problem, according to\nhim, is expressed by the following question: “what is it that we\ndo when we predicate a property of a thing?” Bradley argues that\n \nif you predicate what is different, you ascribe to the subject what it\nis not; and if you predicate what is not different,\nyou say nothing at all. (Bradley 1893:17)  \nTo understand what Bradley means by this, we need to keep in mind that\nhe is here presupposing a bundle view of particulars and that he is\nusing “is” to indicate the identity of the subject with\nthe bundle of qualities (see Wollheim (1959), Bonino (2012) and Baxter\n(1996) for an interpretation that reads his “is” as an\n“is” of identity in this context). His concern is thus\nwith the relationship between the whole, conceived as a bundle of\nqualities, and the qualities themselves. He is worried that if a given\nquality, say blackness, is different from the whole,\nand separate from it (i.e., it is not in the bundle of\nqualities that constitutes the lump of sugar), then it is wrong to\nattribute it to the whole. But if the quality, say whiteness,\nis not distinct from the whole, but just a part of the bundle, then\nthe attribution does not add anything new at all, it trivially states\nwhat is already the case. \nEqually troubling, for Bradley, is the conception of relations as\n“independent” from their terms. Indeed, it leads to the\nfirst of the infinite regresses that Bradley discusses in these pages.\nHe writes: Let us abstain from making the relation an attribute of the related,\nand let us make it more or less independent. ‘There is a\nrelation C, in which A and B stand; and it\nappears with both of them.’ But here again we have made no\nprogress. The relation C has been admitted different from A and\nB, and no longer is predicated of them. Something, however,\nseems to be said of this relation C, and said again, of\nA and B. And this something is not to be the ascription\nof one to the other. If so, it would appear to be another relation\nD, in which C, on one side, and, on the other side,\nA and B stand. But such a makeshift leads at once to the\ninfinite process. (Bradley 1893: 18) \nIn this famous passage, Bradley does not make it sufficiently clear\nwhat exactly generates the infinite regress. He also shifts between\nthe linguistic worry about “something being said” of\nrelation C and relata A and B, and the more\nsubstantial ontological worry about the unity of qualities A,\nB, and the relation C conceived as\n“independent” from relata. Despite this, it seems clear\nthat for Bradley it is the assumed independence of the\nrelation C that generates the problem. An independent relation\nis, according to him, incapable of relating A and B, and\nno amount of further independent relations can do the job either, thus\ngenerating the regress that has the following structure. \nRegress 1 – against “independent” relations as\nunifiers of qualities \nFor this argument to have some force, Bradley needs to argue in\nsupport of his conception of “independent” relations as\nrelations that cannot relate. Although he offers no such argument, he\ndoes give us a clue as to what “real” relations ought to\nbe like:  \nIf it [relation] is to be real [i.e., actually relating], it must be\nsomehow at the expense of the terms, or, at least, must be something\nwhich appears in them or to which they belong. A relation\nbetween A and B implies really a substantial foundation\nwithin them. (Bradley 1893: 18)  \nThis suggests that for Bradley, “real” relations have to\nbe in some way ontologically grounded in their relata. Since his\n“independent” relations are not conceived as grounded in\ntheir relata in such a way, they cannot relate. \nBradley’s “real” relations might sound like\ninternal relations to a contemporary ear. Internal relations,\nfollowing Armstrong (1989: 43) and Lewis (1986: 62), are often\ncharacterized as relations that supervene on the intrinsic properties\nof their relata and that present no ontological addition. Common\nexamples of such relations are taller than, being the\nsame shade of blue, having the same mass. In contrast,\nexternal relations are frequently understood as relations the holding\nof which does not depend on the intrinsic features of particulars that\nthey relate; they present a genuine ontological addition (for\ndifferent ways of understanding the internal/external discussion see\nsection 1 of SEP entry on Relations). Frequently cited\nexamples of external relations are spatio-temporal relations such as\nbeing 2 feet apart, etc. Thus, in the contemporary debate,\nthe question concerning whether or not relations exist turns on the\nquestion of whether or not external relations exist (internal\nones are considered an “ontological free lunch”). But for\nBradley, it is the other way around: according to him, the only\nrelations that stand a chance at being “real” are the ones\nthat are ontologically founded in the terms, the internal ones. The\npeculiar way that such relations are founded in their terms for\nBradley, becomes central for the second regress, which we find in\nchapter III of Appearance and Reality. \nChapter III focuses on the relationship between qualities and\nrelations. The conclusion of the overarching argument in that chapter\nis that the entire relational way of thought is unintelligible and\nflawed. Bradley arrives at this conclusion by arguing first that\nqualities need relations; he then tries to prove that qualities are\nunintelligible with relations; and finally, he argues the same for\nrelations—i.e., that relations need qualities but are\nunintelligible with them. \nBradley’s starting thesis in this chapter is that qualities\nneed relations. He assumes that without relations qualities\nwould just collapse into an indistinguishable blob; thus qualities, in\norder to exist, need relations to somehow separate them out from that\nblob, i.e., to act as difference-makers. In addition, qualities need\nrelations to unify them. Thus, the demand on relations is to act as\nboth distinction-makers and as unifiers of qualities. Qualities, on\ntheir part, also have a “a double character as both supporting\nand as being made by the relation” (Bradley 1893:26). Qualities\nare made by relations through relations’\ndifference-making role, but qualities also need to be related into a\nunified whole. \nFor Bradley, as we saw above, only internal relations stand a chance\nof being\n “real”[1]\n and, subsequently, of doing the double duty just described. At the\nsame time, Bradley’s internal relations (from\nnow on, internalB relations) are meant to be\ngrounded in the proper parts of qualities (see more below on\nthis peculiar understanding of relations). But if different proper\nparts of a quality are to be truly different, they must be made\ndifferent by some additional internal relations. The latter, in\ntheir turn, must be grounded in further different proper parts of\nparts of qualities. This “process of fission”, as Bradley\ncalls it, continues ad infinitum, thus generating the second\ninfinite regress of relations in these pages, and providing Bradley\nwith the alleged “proof” that qualities standing in\nrelations are unintelligible. Regress 2 – against internalB relations\nas unifiers of qualities \nThe main work in this regress is being done by premises (1), (2), and\n(3). It is thus quite unfortunate that Bradley does not spend time\nsubstantiating them. This is especially needed when it comes to his\npeculiar interpretation of internality of a relation as being grounded\nin proper parts of qualities. For why not claim that the quality in\nits entirety can act as part of the ground (the other part being the\nother quality or qualities) for different internal relations? This\nwould certainly be more in keeping with the contemporary understanding\nof internality of a relation and it could stop the regress. To this\nsuggestion, Bradley would probably respond by reiterating the\nunintelligibility of the idea that the very same quality can serve as\npart of an ontological ground for distinctness from other qualities\nas well as part of an ontological ground for the unity with\nother qualities. In response to this, one could challenge\nBradley’s reliance on the assumption that relations need to\naccount for difference between qualities, as well as for their unity.\nIn fact, it would be much simpler to claim that, say,\nwhiteness and sweetness are different not because\nthere is a difference-making part in them, but simply because\nthey are, in their entirety, intrinsically different.\nIntrinsic difference of qualities could be Bradley’s bottom\nline, a primitive of the theory and it would eliminate the need for\nrelations as difference-makers, thus rejecting premise (2) above. \nOne possible interpretation (see Perovic 2014: 381) of why Bradley\ndoes not wish to take distinctness of qualities as ontologically\nprimitive is that he might already be presupposing a primitive which\nis contrary to it—a monistic undifferentiated whole. From such\nmonistic perspective, it would then seem that differentiation of\nqualities would need an explanation and an ontological ground, whereas\nthe lack of differentiation would appear to be an ontological default,\nrequiring no explanation at all. However, although this interpretation\nwould help us understand better why Bradley might have assumed that\nrelations need to act as difference-makers for qualities, it is\ncertainly not terribly charitable to Bradley; that is, it would assume\nthat Bradley had already question-beggingly presupposed monism as the\ndefault ontological position in his arguments against\nrelations. \nFinally, let’s consider the third and final regress brought\nforward by Bradley in chapter III. After claiming that relations are\nunintelligible without qualities, he wants to show that the way\nrelations stand to qualities is equally unintelligible. He writes: \nIf it [relation] is nothing to the qualities, then they are not\nrelated at all; and, if so, as we saw, they have ceased to be\nqualities, and their relation is a nonentity. But if it is to be\nsomething to them, then clearly we now shall require a new\nconnecting relation. For the relation hardly can be the mere adjective\nof one or both of its terms; or, at least, as such it seems\nindefensible. And, being something itself, if it does not itself bear\na relation to the terms, in what intelligible way will it succeed in\nbeing anything to them? But here again we are hurried off into the\neddy of a hopeless process, since we are forced to go on finding new\nrelations without end. The links are united by a link, and this bond\nof union is a link which also has two ends; and these require each a\nfresh link to connect them with the old. (Bradley 1893:\n27–28) \nThe regress presented here is somewhat similar to the one expressed in\nRegress 1 above. In both cases relations are assumed to be\nincapable of relating. In Regress 1, however, Bradley\nexplicitly targeted only the “independent” relations.\nHere, Bradley is assuming the results of his previous arguments, and\nattacking all relations, i.e., relations as such. Regress 3 – against relations as such as unifiers of\nqualities \nIn this regress, Bradley is employing the phrases “being nothing\nto the qualities” and “being something to the\nqualities,” but he doesn’t explain what he means by these\nphrases. If, however, Bradley is to be consistent with his previous\nclaims, relations that are “nothing to the qualities” have\nto be his internalB relations which he dismissed\nwith Regress 2, and relations that are “something to\nthe qualities” have to be his “independent”\nrelations which he dismissed with Regress 1.\nWe should thus read premise\n(2) in Regress 3 as follows: if R is an\ninternalB relation, A and B will end\nup not just not related, but will instead end up in the infinite\nprocess of division, as seen in Regress 2. If, on the other\nhand, R is something to A and B, as in\npremise (3) in Regress 3, it itself has to be\nsomething—that is, it is, in Bradley’s terminology a\nnon-internal, “independent” relation. And\n“independent” relations, as we have seen in Regress\n1, cannot relate and no amount of further independent relations\ncan relate either. \nAfter presenting Regress 3, Bradley believes that he has\nsucceeded in showing that the entire relational way of thought is\nflawed and that relations as such should be relegated to the sphere of\nappearance, rather than to reality. Central to arriving at such a\nconclusion has been his assumption that what he calls\n“independent” relations cannot relate. It seems as if\nBradley simply did not know how to think of such entities and often\nresorts to metaphors and talks about links needing further links at\ntheir ends and insists on our inability to show how “solid\nthings” can be joined to other “solids” (cf. Bradley\n1893: 28). As these metaphors indicate, Bradley’s worry seems to\nbe that if relations are conceived of as independent from the terms\nthat they relate, they themselves will become just like the terms that\nneed relating and this way they will lose their relating power. \nBradley’s arguments against relations gained a different\ndimension during his debate with Russell in the journal Mind,\nduring 1910–1911. At this point, Bradley is no longer concerned\njust with arguments against the relational unity of qualities; rather,\nhe is concerned with the possibility of there being compex unities\nthat cannot be analyzed. \nBy the end of his paper “On Appearance, Error, and\nContradiction” (1910), Bradley challenges Russell to explain how\nhe can reconcile his pluralism of terms and external relations with\nhis commitment to complex unanalyzable entities which have terms and\nexternal relations as constituents. He writes as follows: \nBradley thinks that a pluralist who postulates two fundamental simple\nentities cannot also admit a third fundamental entity which\nis complex, i.e., constituted out of the simple entities. There is a\ntension which must be resolved by either letting go of the\nfundamentality of the simples (the view that Bradley would have opted\nfor); or by letting go of the fundamentality of complexes (the view\nthat Bradley thinks a consistent pluralist should embrace). But there\nis a further way that the tension might be resolved, and this is by\narguing that simples and complexes are fundamental in different senses\nof the term “fundamental”. (For different senses of\nfundamentality in this context see Perovic (2016) who distinguishes\nbetween constitutive, explanatory, and existential\nfundamentality.) \nRussell’s own reply to Bradley focused on clarifying the sense\nin which he claimed that complex unities cannot be analyzed. He wrote\nback the following: \nIn this reply to Bradley, Russell is taking care to point out that he\nis using the term “analysis” to designate a process\nperformed by us of “discovery of the constituents of\nthe complex” (Russell 1910: 374). This signifies a departure\nfrom his claims in the Principles of Mathematics, where he\nargued that propositional unities could not be analyzed because\nanalysis would destroy the unity of the proposition (Russell 1903:\n50–51). This shift in the understanding of the notion of\n“analysis” from ontological breaking down of unities to\nsomething that we perform when we are discovering\nconstituents of complex entities, allows Russell to say that complexes\nare the only objects that can in fact be analyzed. \nIn addition, Russell pinpoints his disagreement with Bradley when it\ncomes to relations. Russell explicitly rejects the view which favors\ninternal relations, that is, which holds “that the fact\nthat an object x has a certain relation R to an object y implies\ncomplexity in x and y, i.e., it implies something in the\n“natures” of x and y in virtue of which they are related\nby the relation R” (Russell 1910: 373–374). Instead,\nRussell states his support of external relations, the holding\nof which cannot be derived from the terms that such relations relate\nor their intrinsic complexity. Instead, when we have x and y standing\nin an external relation R, we then have a complex or a unity\nxRy. What distinguishes such a complex from a “mere\naggregate”, according to Russell, is that a relation in a\nunified complex relates whereas in an aggregate it does not\nrelate and is just a member of an aggregate. \nRussell’s reply was unsatisfying to Bradley, who followed up\nwith his “Reply to Mr Russell’s Explanations” in\n1911, reiterating some of the same concerns. Namely, Bradley\nrepeatedly returns to the worry about external relations—he\nfinds them to be unobservable and unthinkable without the terms; a\nrelation apart from its terms is indeed for Bradley an\n“indefensible abstraction”. In addition, he asks Russell\nto elaborate further on the presumed difference between an aggregate\nof entities and a unity of those entities. Bradley says that an appeal\nto relating relations is unsatisfying and further asks Russell to\nexplain wherein the difference between relating relations and\nnon-relating relations lies for him. But for Russell there was no\nfurther story to be told; the difference between relating and\nnon-relating relations is a primitive on which he did not feel the\nneed to offer any further details.  \nBetween 1923 and the first part of 1924, Bradley returned to the topic\nof relations. He was working on an article that he intended to publish\nin Mind, the first part of which was posthumously made\navailable in his Collected Essays vol.2, under the simple\ntitle “Relations”. This manuscript is significant because\nBradley is, on the one hand, restating in a slightly different way\nwhat he takes to be the most salient arguments from his previous works\nand, on the other hand, expanding his attack on relations. \nThus, we find again his regress argument against external relations,\nmotivated by his assumption that such relations cannot relate;\nexternal relations are, he writes, no more than “mere\nabstractions” from relational facts and as such hold no relating\npower (Bradley 1926: 643). Internal relations are no improvement, and\nBradley rejects as untrue any suggestions that he might have wanted to\naccept them (642). The true problem seems to be that “an actual\nrelation […] must possess at once both the characters of a\n‘together’ and a ‘between’, and, failing\neither of these, is a relation no longer” Bradley 1926: 644,\n634). Thus, just as in his Appearance and Reality (1893),\nBradley is demanding of relations that they fulfill both an\n“in-between role” (what I have called above a\ndifference-making role) as well as the “together”\nrole (what I have called the unifying role). Failing either of these\nroles amounts to not being a true relation, which in turn makes the\npresumed relational experience contradictory, for Bradley: \nAs this often quoted passage illustrates, Bradley’s skepticism\nabout relations takes the form of the “how” question.\nBradley’s “how” question is often read as\n“How do relations relate?”. But taking into\naccount the wider context, his question is actually\n“How might relations at the same time relate\nand diversify their relata?”. Failing to see how\nrelations might do both, Bradley concludes that relational\nexperience is marred by contradiction. \nFinally, by the end of “Relations”, Bradley wishes to make\nit clear that what is fatal to his monism is not just a specific type\nof relations (such as asymmetric relations), but an ultimate reality\nof any kind of relation: “For not one kind of relation,\nbut every and any relation, if taken as an ultimate reality, would (on\nany view such as mine) be fatal to Monism” (Bradley 1926: 649).\nThis is an important reminder of Bradley’s own motivation for\nhis repeated arguments against\n relations.[2] \nIn the decades since Bradley’s original discussion in\nAR, “Bradley’s regress” has come to refer\nto a wider variety of arguments. This widening of scope has happened\nin two main directions: (i) with respect to the ontology that the\narguments target; and (ii) with respect to the type of the argument\npresented. In this section we will take a closer look at both of these\nextensions. \nAs we have seen in section 1.2 above, Bradley’s original regress\narguments targeted a one-category ontology of qualities, where by\n“qualities” Bradley seemed to have in mind unrepeatable\nparticularized properties, i.e., tropes. But the same\nargument form has been used against the one-category ontology of\nqualities conceived as multiply occurring universals, as well as\nagainst the two-category ontologies of particulars and universals, as\nwell as particulars and tropes. \nBradley’s regress arguments apply easily to the one-category\nontology of universals. The same problem that Bradley articulated for\ntrope-like qualities can be articulated for universals: namely, what\nis it that unites universals of whiteness,\nsweetness, and hardness into the particular lump\nof sugar? If ordinary particulars such as lumps of sugar are\nnothing but bundles of universal qualities, it seems important to\nprovide an account of unity of such bundles. The challenge is\nparticularly difficult in the case of universals because, unlike\ntropes, they are concieved as multiply occurring entities that are\nwholly present in each of their instances. Thus, the problem of\nuniting a bundle of universals such as whiteness,\nsweetness, and hardness will go hand in hand with\nthe problem of individuation of bundles of universals, i.e., the\nproblem of distinguishing between this particular bundle of\nwhiteness, sweetness, and hardness and\nanother exact duplicate bundle of whiteness,\nsweetness, and hardness. \nBradley’s regress arguments have been most widely discussed\nwithin the context of the realists’ two-category ontology of\nparticulars and universals. The challenge in this context is to\nprovide an ontological ground of unity of particulars and universals,\nand the worry is that any appeal to a relation R (of instantiation,\nexemplification, etc.) to unify a particular a with its\nrespective property universal F sets off an infinite regress of\nrelations, similar to the regresses described by Bradley. In the light\nof this problem, some realists such as Olson (1987), and Armstrong\n(1997) have argued that it is a third entity - the fact or\nstate of affairs of a being F that provides the\nontological ground of unity of a and Fness as well as\nthe truthmaker for the truth that “a is F”.\nAccording to critics (see, for instance, Vallicella 2000 and 2002),\nthis approach instead of solving the problem of unity of particulars\nand universals, merely reframes it as the one threatening the very\npossibility of there being such entities as facts or states of\naffairs. Similar worries have arisen for trope theorists that embrace\na two-category ontology of particulars and tropes. Philosophers such\nas C.B. Martin (1980) and Daly (1997) have worried that an appeal to a\nrelation of inherence in the context of unfying a substratum\nand its property trope would lead to an infinite regress of inherence\nrelataions. \nFinally, D.M. Armstrong (1979) has stated a regress argument similar\nto Bradley’s, as a threat to class nominalists. The thought is\nthat since class nominalists analyze particulars’ having of\nproperties in terms of particulars’ membership in a class of\nthings that all have those properties, they would incur a regress when\ntrying to define a membership relation. However, class nominalists\nlike Lewis (2002), have been adamant about not being committed to a\nmembership relation of any sort; indeed, Lewis has argued\nthat all we have is a “singular-to-plural copula:\n‘is one of’ as in ‘this is one of\nthose’.” (Lewis 2002: 10, italics mine). \nThere are a number of problems that tend to be brought up in the\ncontext of discussing Bradley’s regress but that do not take the\nform of a regress argument. The three that stand out are: (1) the\nproblem of explaining what differentiates a unified complex entity\nfrom a mere aggregate of its constituents; (2) the problem of\nexplaining how exactly it is that relations relate; and (3) the problem\nof explaining how the specific complex comes into\nexistence. \nFor a proponent of particulars, universals, and states of affairs,\nthis problem takes the form of the following questions: what is the\nontological ground of the difference between the sum a+F\nand the unified state of affairs Fa? It could be the case\nthat both a and F exist at a world, and thus that the\nsum a+F exists at such a world, without it being the case\nthat Fa obtains (but, say, a being G and b being\nF obtain). What then is the ground of such a difference?\nSimilarly, what provides an ontological ground of the difference\nbetween the sum a+R+b and the unified state of affairs\naRb? It might be the case that all three a, R,\nand b exist at a world, and hence that their sum is given,\nwithout it being the case that aRb obtains (instead, say,\naRc and bRd obtain). The same sort of\nquestion can be posed, of course, for other ontologies. For instance,\nfor a bundle trope theorist the question will be: what is the\nontological ground of the difference between the sum\nF1+G1+H1 of\nproperty tropes and a unified trope bundle constituted out of them?\n(See Armstrong 1989, 1997; Vallicella 2000, 2002; Maurin 2010;\nand Meinertsen 2008, amongst others for such a formulation of the\nproblem.) \nIt must be noted that this problem takes it for granted: (i) that\nmereological sums are unproblematic and a metaphysical default,\nwhereas complexes are problematic and in need of an explanation; and\n(ii) that all kinds of entities (particulars, universal properties and\nrelations, tropes, etc.) can indeed be summed regardless of\nwhether such entities can exist independently of others. Similar\nassumptions are made in formulations that make no reference to\nmereological sums but rather contrast lists, groupings, or sets of\nentities with the unified complexes such as states of affairs or\nbundles of tropes. \nPhilosophers who pose the problem in these terms, will often move on\nto generate a regress argument for any attempt to explain the\ndifference between a sum/list/set of entities and a unified complex\nthat appeals to relations. The next question becomes: what will\naccount for the difference between a sum/list/set of entities\na, F, and a relation R (of instantiation or\nexemplification) on the one hand, and a unified state of affairs of\na being F, on the other? The implication is that any addition\nof further relations will set off Bradley’s regress of\nrelations, with no explanation in sight (see in particular Vallicella\n(2000)). \nThe question “How do relations relate?” can be traced back\nto Bradley (1926: 635), and it fuels much of the recent discussion\nsurrounding Bradley’s regress (see Simons 1994, Maurin 2010,\nMeinertsen 2008, Wieland and Betti 2008). But, as we saw in\nsection 1.4 above, Bradley’s “how” question was\nmotivated by his puzzlement over the dual role that he\nthought relations had to fill; he saw them as having to distinguish\nbetween different relata and having to unify them. Thus his\nquestion was not so much “how do relations relate?” but\nrather “how do relations relate as well as\ndifferentiate their relata?” \nIn contrast, contemporary philosophers’ puzzlement over\n“how relations relate” stems from a different place. The\nassumption in this case seems to be that unless some account of the\nnature of relations adequately explains what makes\nthem apt to unite distinct relata, an appeal to relations as relating\nentities is illicit. The type of explanation that philosophers are\nafter in this context often remains unspecified, though it is clear\nthat what is expected is not a causal explanation, but a metaphysical\nexplanation of some kind. It is assumed that an adequate explanation\nwill refer to some special feature of relations that makes it possible\nfor them to relate; absent such feature, relations are usually\nconsidered to be relationally inert and Bradley’s regress of\nrelations is re-introduced.  This problem is usually brought out by contrasting it\nwith the general problem of existence of complexes. The question is\nnot “what is it that unifies states of affairs/bundles of\ntropes?” but rather “what is it that unifies this\nparticular bundle of whiteness, hardness, and\nsweetness into a lump of sugar?” and “what is\nthat unifies this particular chair and the universal blackness?”\nVallicella puts the question, as it applies to facts, in the following\nway:  \nWhat makes it the case that a number of constituents of the right\nkinds—constituents which are connectable so as to form a fact\nbut need not be connected to exist—are actually\nconnected so as to form an actual or existing fact? (Vallicella\n2000: 242)  \n(Note that a similar formulation of this problem can be found in\nMaurin 2010). \nVallicella and others who pose the question in these terms make it\nclear that they are not after a causal story about how a particular\nlump of sugar or a particular black chair was made. Instead, what\ndrives the problem as posed is the assumed contingent nature of the\nconnection between constituents of states of affairs. This chair is\nblack but it might have been some other color; and this blackness, for\nrealists, need not be instantiated here, it might (and in fact\nis) present in many other states of affairs. So what is it\nthat “makes it so” that this particular blackness and this\nparticular chair are actually united? There is nothing in the\nnatures of constituents of states of affairs to require that\nthey come together, so—the thought is - something else must\nbring those constituents together. \nIn this section, we will take a closer look at different strategies\nphilosophers have employed in engaging with Bradley’s regress\narguments and the associated problems discussed above (I will be using\nthe locution “Bradleyean arguments” to refer indifferently\nto both of these cateogires). The first fork in the road for\nphilosophers has been to either reject the argument by questioning one\nor more of the assumptions that the argument makes, or to accept and\nrespond to the argument on its own terms. Those that have chosen the\nrejectionist approach have mostly done so by challenging\nBradley’s skepticism about relations’ ability to relate\ntheir relata. Russell, Broad, Blanshard, Alexander, and Grossman have\nargued that it is a job of relations to relate and that\nBradley’s relational regresses cannot get started if\nrelations’ relating role is taken seriously. Many more\nphilosophers, however, have found Bradleyean argument compelling and\nhave responded in one of the following ways. They have appealed to: 1)\nsome sort of non-relational tie or nexus to relate\nthe relata (Bergmann, Strawson); 2) external relations equipped with\nspecial features (Meinertsen’s self-relating relations,\nVallicella’s external relations with the power of\nself-determination, Maurin’s and Weiland and Betti’s\nrelata-specific relations); 3) the mutual inter-dependence of the\nwould-be relata (Frege, Baxter, Simons); 4) complexes as brute\nunifiers of their constituents (Olson, Armstrong); and 5) the benign\nnature of the regress in question (Armstrong, Orilia). \nRejectionists about Bradleyean arguments tend to question one or more\nof the assumptions on which the argument rests. With respect to the\nregresses, rejectionists have mainly questioned the grounds of\nBradley’s skepticism about relations and their relating role. As\nwe have seen in section 1.3 above, Russell employed this strategy when\ndebating Bradley in the journal Mind, in 1910. On that\noccasion, Russell argued in favor of external relations and\ntheir relating role within complexes of the form\n aRb.[3] \nC. D. Broad (1933) also objected to Bradley for his treatment of\nrelations; he thought that the main problem had to do with\nBradley’s treatment of relations as if they were particulars in\nneed of being related themselves. He wrote, rather harshly: \nWe find a very similar take on Bradley’s regress in Blanshard\n(1986). He argued contra Bradley that “R is not\nthe same sort of being as its terms. It is neither a thing nor a\nquality. It is a relation, and the business of a relation is to\nrelate” (Blanshard 1986: 215). \nMore of the same can also be found in Alexander (1920 [1966], vol. 1, 249,\n256) and Grossmann (1992: 55–56). Though they are less harsh\nthan Broad and Blanshard in their assessment of Bradley’s\nregress arguments, they are unambiguous in their diagnosis of the\nproblem as one involving the wrong conception of relations. According\nto Grossmann, for instance, the correct conclusion to draw from\nBradley’s regress argument is that “it is really an\nargument not against relations, but against the assumption that\nrelations need to be related to what they relate” (Grossmann\n1992: 55). \nIn recent debate, replies to Bradley’s regress that bluntly\ninsist on relations’ relating role have been unpopular. This is\nbecause the debate has shifted to include the associated questions\noutlined in 2.2. above, including the question: “How do\nrelations relate?”. Thus, if one is after the answer to the\n“how” question, simply saying that it is the job of\nrelations to relate is deemed unsatisfactory. \nOne sort of rejectionist reply to Bradleyean arguments can be found in\nPerovic (2014). Perovic (2014) argues that Bradley’s original\nregress arguments in AR rest on unsubstantiated assumptions\nand thus cannot be considered as successful reductio\narguments against relations. For example, the first regress takes for\ngranted that as long as unifying relations are conceived as\n“independent” from their relata, they cannot relate. The\nsecond regress assumes that unifying of qualities cannot be achieved\nwith “internal” relations either; for the latter are\nunderstood as being grounded in proper parts of qualities, which\nleads, according to Bradley, to an infinite regress. She points out\nthat it is not clear why Bradley understands internal relations as\ngrounded in proper parts of qualities that they relate, nor is it\nclear why Bradley believes that relations, if they are to have any\nstanding, ought to fill a dual role of unifying their relata as well\nas providing the ground of their distinctness. Perovic (2014)\nconcludes that without further support, Bradley’s original\narguments against relations as unifiers of qualities do not establish\nthe unreality of relations; an appeal to external relations as\nunifiers of their relata is still a perfectly acceptable option for\nboth realists and trope theorists. \nA great number of philosophers have found Bradley’s regress\narguments to be compelling as stated. Some, in fact, have taken the\nregress arguments to be so threatening, that they have concluded that\nonly non-relational ties might be able to unify qualities. Strawson\n(1959: 167–170), for instance, has appealed to non-relational\nties such as instantial tie and characterizing tie\nto unify a particular with a sortal (such as dog) and\ncharacterizing universal (such as wisdom) respectively. He\nthought of these ties as being more intimate relators than ordinary\nrelations as well as allowing for greater heterogeneity between the\nterms they bind. Bergmann (1967: 9) famously appealed to a\nnon-relational tie he called “nexus” and which he\nintroduced to tie the qualities directly, without mediation. Armstrong\n(1978: 110, 1989: 109) too embraced something he called a\n“non-relational fundamental tie” of instantiation. \nTwo objections are frequently brought against non-relational ties: (1)\nthey are found to be more obscure than full-blooded relations; and (2)\nthey are accused of not being able to stop the regress any more than\nordinary relations do. Philosophers that find relations to be\nsuspicious entities, tend to find non-relational ties even more\nsuspicious and obscure. They ask: How are non-relational ties\ndifferent from relations? If they are meant to relate or\n“tie” their relata, are they not sufficiently like\nrelations? And if there was a problem with Bradley’s regress of\nrelations in the first place, don’t we have the same problem\nwith non-relational ties? (Lewis (2002) has made similar remarks\nagainst non-relational ties in the context of discussing the problem\nof termporary intrinsics and the adverbialist reply to the problem.)\nVallicella (2000: 241) has attacked non-relational ties by arguing that\neven if the nexus manages to save Bergmann from the regress, the unity\nproblem remains. The problem, as Vallicella sees it, then becomes that\nnexus is sufficiently like a universal that it remains\nunclear what it is that unites a, Fness, and\nnexus into a state of affairs as opposed to having a mere sum\nof a+Fness+nexus. \nPhilosophers impressed by Bradleyean arguments, but with the desire to\npreserve relations as unifiers of complex entities such as states of\naffairs or bundles of tropes, have been drawn towards postulating\nrelations with certain special features. Convinced that relations\nordinarily concieved would lead to a dangerous regress, these\nphilosophers have tried to equip their relations with characteristics\nthat would enable them to relate their relata and answer the\n“how do relations relate?” question. \nFor instance, Vallicella has argued in favor of an external unifying\noperator that connects a fact’s constituents and brings facts\ninto existence. This external unifier U is described as a\n“metaphysical agent” that acts as an “existence\nmaker” for facts (Vallicella 2000: 250); it does so due to\n“the power of contingent self-determination”, i.e., it has\n“the power to contingently determine itself as operating upon\nits operand” (Vallicella 2000: 256). In characterizing U\nin this way, Vallicella is trying to ensure both that the connection\nbetween U and what it unifies remains contingent, and\nthat such unity is grounded in U itself (out of worry about the\ninfinite regress). The only way that he can see U fulfill both\nthese roles is by construing it “along the lines of God or a\ntranscendental consciousness” (Vallicella 2000: 256). The\ntrouble with this reply to Bradleyean arguments is, of course, that\nthe god-like creating role of the external unifier U remains\nquite murky and it seems to bring in consciousness into both the\noperator itself as well as the creation of states of affairs. \nAnother novel relation has been proposed by Meinertsen (2008). He has\nargued for a self-relating relation to do the uniting of particulars\nand universals into states of affairs. According to this proposal,\nwhat makes R related to the pair (a, b) is a\nunifying self-relating relation U* which unites\nitself to R, a, and b. Thus, a state of\naffairs R (a, b) turns out to be identical to the\nstate of affairs U* (U*, R, a,\nb) and a state of affairs Fa is just a short for\nU*(U*, F, a) (cf. Meinertsen 2008:\n12). The self-relating relation U* occurs\ntwice in the states of affairs it unites: the first time, outside the\nbrackets, U* occurs in its “active” relating\nrole; the second time, inside the brackets, U* occurs in its\n“passive” role as one of the constituents being related\n(cf. Meinertsen 2008: 15).  \nAll this evokes Russell’s talk of relations having dual nature,\ni.e., being able to occur as terms of relations as well as relating\nrelations. The trouble with such dual roles, is to explain, as Bradley\nasked Russell: “What is the difference between a relation which\nrelates in fact and one which does not so relate?” (Bradley\n1911: 74). Or for Meinertsen: What is the difference between a\nrelation occurring in its passive role and it occurring in its active\nrole? If we are willing to accept as a primitive that\nthere is such a difference and that it is thanks\nto U*’s dual role as a self-relating relation that it\nis able to unify constituents of a complex a, b,\nand R, then why exactly is such a view an improvement upon a\nview that takes it that a relating relation\nR simply relates its relata? \nWeiland and Betti (2008) on the one hand, and Maurin (2010) on the\nother, have argued for relata-specific relations as unifiers of tropes\nin trope bundles (Weiland and Betti hint at a possible extension of\nthis idea to relations unifying particulars and universals in states\nof affairs). They have argued that the relational trope of\ncompresence construed as asymmetrically dependent on specific\nrelata is the way to solve the Bradleyean unity problem. It is part of\nthe very nature of the relation of compresence to relate specific\nrelata; thus, there would be a different compresence trope for each\nspecific bundle of tropes. As Weiland and Betti put it:  \nIf a relation is relata-specific, it necessarily relates its relata,\nbut only if it exists. To put it in possible-worlds\nterminology: if R holds between a and b in the\nactual world, it holds between a and b in all possible\nworlds in which R exists (and not in any possible world in\nwhich a and b exist, or in any possible world\nwhatsoever). (Weiland and Betti 2008: 519) \nIn “Function and Concept” (1891), Frege famously described\na concept-object distinction as a special case of the\nfunction-argument distinction. Concepts, according to Frege, were\nunsaturated and incomplete entities, in need of completion by objects.\nBecause of such natures of concepts and objects, the two would\npresumably “fit” together without any intermediaries. \nTaking a cue from Frege, some philosophers have argued in favor of a\ntwo-sided dependence of constituents of states of affairs (and a\nmany-sided dependence of property tropes in trope bundles) as a\nnon-relational way of accounting for the unity of such complexes.\nBaxter (2001), for instance, has proposed that the unity of particular\nand universal should be analyzed as partial identity. For\nBaxter, both particulars and universals have “aspects”.\nDifferent instances of one and the same universal are different\naspects of a universal; spatial parts of particulars are\ntheir different aspects. Particulars and universals can be\npartially identical by overlapping in their aspects. Baxter writes:\n \nSuppose Hume is a particular, Benevolence is a universal, and Hume is\nbenevolent. Then Hume has as an aspect, Hume insofar as he is\nbenevolent. Also Benevolence has as an aspect, Benevolence insofar as\nHume has it. These are the same aspect—Hume’s benevolence.\n(Baxter 2001: 454) \nHume’s benevolence in Baxter’s example is what\nArmstrong calls a state of affairs. In fact, Armstrong was\ntemporarily swayed by Baxter’s partial identity view of\nstates of affairs, but then went on to object to the view on the\ngrounds that partial identity cannot be merely contingent. Thus, for\nlater Armstrong, “once one has identity, even if only partial\nidentity, there will be found necessity” (Armstrong 2005: 317).\nA particular, thus, necessarily has all the properties that\nit in fact has, and the universal necessarily has the\ninstances that it has. This outcome secures the unity of particulars\nand universals but at a cost of embracing a strong version of\nnecessitarianism. \nInspired by earlier Armstrong, Perovic (2016) has proposed a\nnon-necessitarian dependence model for particulars and universals in\nstates of affairs. On this model, the constituents of most states of\naffairs such as this chalk being white exhibit mutual\ngeneric existential dependence. This simply captures the idea\nthat a particular piece of chalk presumably cannot exist without\nhaving some color or other, it is generically existentially dependent\nupon some color universal. Similarly, the universal whiteness\nis generically existentially dependent on some concrete\nparticular, for it cannot exist without inhering in some concrete\nparticular or other, but it need not be the particular piece of chalk\na. However, the state of affairs this particular chalk\nbeing white exhibits the strongest kind of dependence on its\nconstitutive particular and universal—namely, it seems to\nexhibit one-sided specific existential dependence on its\nconstituents. The reason why specific states of affairs seem to\nexhibit such strong existential dependence, is because of the simple\nfact that any change in a particular or in a universal would bring\nabout a different state of affairs.  \nSimons (1994) put forward a similar proposal within the framework of\nhis “nuclear theory” of tropes. He thinks of bundles of\ntropes as having different levels of unity. Property tropes that are\nessential to a particular are tightly woven through mutual dependence\non one another, whereas property tropes that are accidental are more\nloosely dependent upon the tight bundle tropes in the nucleus. \nOne might find these sorts of proposals wanting since they only\ncharacterize the types of dependence that hold between constituents of\nunified wholes (whether they are states of affairs or nuclear bundles\nof tropes). But, the objection goes, they do not account for the\ndifference between constituents considered outside of such unities and\nconstituents in a unified whole. Here, Perovic (2016) is happy to\nadmit that she is not trying to provide such an account in the first\nplace. Following Armstrong, she takes the world to be exhausted by\nstates of affairs and takes particulars and universals to exist only\nin states of affairs. \nThe term “brute fact approach” is slightly ambiguous. It\ncan be identified with the rejectionist view sketched along the lines\nof 3.1 above, where to say that relations’ job is to relate is\nto take that fact about relations as primitive or “brute”.\nHowever, the expression, as it is used here, is intended to refer to\nthe view that takes complexes such as states of affairs or facts as\nunifiers of their own constituents. This view was defended by Olson\n(1987) and Armstrong (1989, 1997), and challenged by Vallicella\n(2000). \nOlson finds that the upshot of Bradley’s arguments was not so\nmuch a reductio of relations, but to show that facts should\nbe taken as irreducible entities. The word “relation”, for\nOlson, is ambiguous between two senses: the first one is to designate\nan entity that can be multiply instantiated by various pairs of\nrelata, whereas the second sense is to designate the fact of\nrelatedness. In place of “relation”, Olson prefers the\nword “connection”, since it “can only mean being\nconnected. There is not the same temptation to think of it as an\nadditional thing that does the connecting.  The connection is\nnot a constituent of the fact; it is the fact itself” (Olson\n1987: 61).  Armstrong seems to have something similar to this in mind\nwhen he says that states of affairs “come first”. But then\nhe also adds that they “hold their constituents\ntogether in a non-mereological form of composition, a form of\ncomposition that even allows the possibility of having different\nstates of affairs with identical constituents” (Armstrong 1997:\n118, italics added). \nVallicella (2002) has objected to this sort of brute fact approach\nthat it is mysterious and incoherent. He even accuses the proponents\nof the brute fact approach as being committed to the following\ncontradiction:  \nIt is self-evident that a fact, being a complex, is composed of its\nconstituents and is thus nothing more than them. But it is also\nself-evident that a fact, being the unity of its constituents, is more\nthan its constituents. Faced with this contradiction, we must either\ndeny the existence of facts altogether […] or look beyond facts\nto something that can remove the contradiction. (Vallicella 2002:\n20–21)  \nThis objection, of course, presupposes that the only non-controversial\nform of composition is the mereological kind and that facts are\n“nothing more than their constituents”. Armstrong’s\nand Olson’s facts openly go against these assumptions: they are\nunities that are more than just the sum of their constituents. But\nfailing to provide further ground for the difference between the sum\nand the fact makes such facts brute and unacceptable to\nVallicella. \nIn the context of discussion of states of affairs as unifiers of their\nconstituents, Armstrong anticipated Vallicella’s objection just\ndescribed. His reply was to claim that even if he had to concede that\nit was necessary to introduce a relation or a “fundamental\ntie” to account for the peculiar unity present in states of\naffairs, the resulting regress would not be vicious. In fact, such a\nregress would be closer to the benign truth regress—many truths,\nbut only one truthmaker, just like with “p”, and “it\nis true that p”, and “it is true that it is true that\np”, etc. Treating the instantiation regress in the same way, we\nwould have the first instantiation relation uniting the constituents\nof the state of affairs, but all further relations would supervene and\nnot present any further ontological addition. \nOrilia (2006, 2007) develops this sort of response a bit further. He\nagrees with Armstrong (1997) that Bradley’s regress is an\nexplanatory regress that is, in fact, benign. What makes it benign for\nOrilia is that at each step of an explanation the added fact explains\nthe previous one via an additional external relation. He\nargues that despite it being the case “that at any given stage\nwe can continue the explanatory task”, it “does\nnot show that no knowledge or no understanding is provided at any\nstage”. According to Orilia, this “merely shows that at no stage we know/understand everything that there\nis to know/understand about the explicandum that gives rise\nto the expalantory chain. And noting that the explicandum in\nquestion gives rise to such an infinite chain may be considered part\nof our understanding of it” (Orilia 2007: 160). \nEven if one were to grant Orilia that there can be infinite dependence\nchains of facts, for Maurin (2015) a crucial problem remains\nunresolved. According to her, Orilia’s account does nothing to\nanswer what she calls the “how” question, i.e., the\nquestion “how can there be a situation in which the\nstate of affairs that a is F exists?”. She argues that\nthe infinitist’s reply already presupposes that there\nis unity of states of affairs before explaining what its\nexistence depends upon—that is, a further state of affairs, etc.\nBut the all important “how” question, according to Maurin,\nremains unanswered. \nGrounding. The metaphysical debate about the nature of\ngrounding and metaphysical explanation has taken an interest in\nBradley’s regress from a different perspective. Here, the main\nBradley-inspired issue has been whether or not it should be one of the\nrequirements for a metaphysical explanation that it “must ground\nout”. The problem with Bradley’s regress in this context\nis that it appears to be committed to an infinite chain of facts, each\none ontologically dependent on the subsequent one for its explanation.\nThis is the situation described positively by Orilia (2006, 2007)\nabove. The unity of a state of affairs Fa is explained by\nappeal to another higher-order fact R<Fa>, and this one\nin turn is explained by appeal to a further fact R′<R,\n<Fa>>, and so on ad infinitum. However, Cameron\n(2008) has found such a dependence chain to be very problematic. He\nbelieves that there is a strong intuition in favor of there being “a metaphysical ground, a realm of ontologically independent objects\nwhich provide the ultimate ontological basis for all the ontologically\ndependent entities, and a realm of basic facts which provide the\nultimate metaphysical ground for all the derivative facts” (Cameron\n2008: 8). \nCameron admits that it is hard to argue for this intuition by appeal\nto a further, more basic metaphysical principle. Instead, he suggests,\nit can be supported by appeal to theoretical utility; a unified\nexplanation of the same sort of phenomenon seems preferable to an\ninfinite descending chains of separate explanations. In response to\nCameron, Orilia (2009) has pointed out weaknesses in Cameron’s\nappeal to a unified explanation as a way of supporting the thesis of\nwell-foundeness of all chains of ontological dependence (WF);\nthus, Orialia has concluded that WF cannot yet have a claim\nof being a contingent truth. \nAnother interesting question inspired by Bradley’s regress\narguments, has been posed by Bennett (2011). Her question is: is\ngrounding itself fundamental? Prima facie, it seems that it can\nneither be fundamental, nor grounded. But if it is neither, then the\ngrounding would have to be rejected, which is an unattractive outcome\nthat Bennett does not want to embrace. Inspired by Armstrong’s\n(1989) discussion of the Bradley problem and relations of\ninstantiation as internal and supervenient upon their relata, she then\nexplores whether the grounding relation itself could be treated in a\nsimilar fashion. There is one important difference: rather than have\ngrounding supervene on two or more relata, Bennett proposes that it be\ntreated as a relation that supervenes upon only one of its relata.\nSuch a relation she calls “superinternal”. \nDebate concerning the nature of mataphysical explanation and the\nconcept of grounding is quite prolific and ongoing. (For a detailed\ndiscussion see the SEP entry on Grounding.) What one must keep in mind\nwhen it comes to Bradleyean problems and grounding is that the former\ndebate is itself quite varied and without a consensus on either the\nnature of the problem or the desiderata for the satisfactory solution.\nThus, caution should be advised when importing conclusions from one\ncontentious problem into the area of another even more abstract and\ncontentious one. \nComposition. Grounding considerations and Bradley’s\nregress have found their application in the discussion of the problem\nof composition of objects. Brzozowski (2008) has recently posed the\nfollowing question concerning the location of composite objects: does\nthe location of a composite object derive from the location of its\nproper parts, or not? (Brzozowski 2008: 193). Either way, Brzozowski\ntakes it that we get unappealing consequences. The first horn of the\ndilemma is that if indeed the location of composite objects\nis derived from their proper parts, the possibility of spatio-temporal\ngunk objects (composite objects whose parts are themselves composite\nobjects) would have to be denied. If, on the other hand, the location\nof composite objects is not derived from their proper parts, then\nbrute metaphysical necessities connecting the location of composite\nobjects with the locations of their proper parts must be posited.\nBrzozowski argues in favor of the first horn of the dilemma, and part\nof his argument relies on applying a Bradley-type argument to the\nlocation of gunk objects. His main thought is that there would be a\nserious problem of location of gunk objects since “even though at each level of the series of decomposition we can\nexplain the location of a composite object by appealing to the\nlocation of a proper part, it is left unexplained how any\nobject in the series is located in space-time. Given the piecemeal\nstory, there is no way for the totality of location relations to be\ngrounded…” (Brzozowski 2008: 201). \nAs we can see, Brzozowski here relies on some version of Cameron’s\nWF principle described above. \nPhilosophy of Language. Outside of the strictly metaphysical\ndebates, Bradleyean arguments are often brought up when discussing the\nproblem of the unity of the proposition. This problem in philosophy of\nlanguage is usually put as follows: what is the difference between a\nmere list of words such as \"wise, Alice, is\" and a meaningful sentence\nsuch as \"Alice is wise\"? The latter seems to possess a unity of some\nsort, but what is the exact nature of such unity and how does it come\nabout? In analogy with the ontological version of Bradley’s\nregress, philosophers then worry that an appeal to a copula does not\nexplain what it is that is special about the unity present in\n“Alice is wise” and absent in a mere list. And no appeal\nto further copulas will help the matters either. \nThere has been a tendency recently to view the problem of the unity of\nthe proposition as a useful heuristic in interpreting views of Frege,\nRussell, and Wittgenstein. We can see this in Davidson’s (2005)\nposthumous work on truth and predication, where he often runs together\nthe ontological and the semantic versions of what he refers to as\n“the problem of predication”. More careful work on this\nissue has been recently done by Gaskin (1995, 2008) and Collins\n(2011). The particularly obscure nature of the debate between Russell\nand Wittgenstein over Russell’s theory of judgment has lent\nitself to being interpreted as concerning the problem of the unity of\nthe proposition. For such an interpretation see in particular Hanks\n(2007).","contact.mail":"katarina-perovic@uiowa.edu","contact.domain":"uiowa.edu"}]
