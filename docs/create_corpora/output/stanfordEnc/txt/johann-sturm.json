He was a correspondent of\nRobert Boyle (1627–1691) and Gottfried Leibniz\n(1646–1716), among others. Sturm’s thought mirrors the\ncomplex interplay between debates in metaphysics, natural philosophy,\nand theology that characterize the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury.\n\n\nIn his numerous academic works, Sturm forcefully defends the use of\nthe experimental method in natural philosophy. He advocates an\ninclusive and open-minded examination of old and new philosophical\ntheories in order to find the best explanations for observed\nphenomena. In metaphysics, Sturm is one of the most outspoken\nsupporters of occasionalism, the theory according to which finite\nbeings lack genuine causal powers and work only as occasions for\nGod’s causal intervention in nature. While occasionalism was\ndeveloped before Sturm by a number of other authors, Sturm gives his\nown original twist to it by making it the foundation of his system of\nnatural philosophy.\n\n\nSturm was born in Hilpoltstein close to Nuremberg on November 3, 1635\nin the midst of the Thirty Years War (1618–1648) which\ndevastated mainly those areas that were to later constitute the\nterritory of Germany. Sturm’s father, Johann Eucharius Sturm,\nwas a tailor, valet, treasurer, and custodian of the silverware at the\ncourt of Count Palatine Johann-Friedrich of Pfalz-Hilpoltstein.\nSturm’s mother was Gertraud Bock, daughter of Konrad Bock,\ncountry parson of Liebenstadt. During his infancy, Sturm learned Latin\nand other (fine) arts from the court chaplain (concionator),\nJohann Jakob Beurer. \nWhen the Count Palatine Johann-Friedrich (himself a Protestant) died\nin 1644, leaving no heir to the throne, his territory devolved unto\nhis older brother Wolfgang Wilhelm, who had converted to Catholicism\nin 1613. Although Johann-Friedrich had reached an agreement with his\nbrother that (unlike all other subjects) the courtiers and servants to\nJohann-Friedrich’s court could remain Protestant, this promise\nceased upon his death. As a consequence of the Counter-Reformation,\nall subjects had to become Catholic. Sturm and his family, being\nLutherans and resisting this call, fled the county in 1645. They\nsettled close by in Weißenburg. From 1646 onwards, Sturm\nattended the Latin School in Weißenburg living in the house of\nthe rector, Johannes Hupfer, who took care of him. In 1653, upon the\nadvocacy of Sturm’s father, Daniel Wülfer, priest and dean\nof St. Lorenz, employed Johann Christoph as amanuensis. He supported\nSturm financially and furthered his academic career. Initially, Sturm\nmight have thought about studying at the University of Altdorf, since\nhe enrolled on October 4, 1653. However, he did not take up his\nstudies. \nInstead of studying at the University of Altdorf, Sturm decided to\nread at the University of Jena, enrolling on February 2, 1656. Sturm\nstudied mathematics and physics with both Erhard Weigel\n(1625–1699) and Johann Zeisold (1599–1667). He studied\ntheology with Henning Spoercke. Sturm was awarded the degree of\nmagister philosophiae magna cum laude on January 27, 1658. On\nOctober 10, 1660 Sturm enrolled at the University of Leiden, where he\nstudied philosophy with Johannes De Raey (1622–1702) and\narchitecture privatim with Nicolai Goldmann\n(1611–1665). It was in Leiden that Sturm most likely came into\ncontact with the concept of and the driving force behind the idea of\neclecticism (see\n sect. 2)\n as Henricus Bornius (1617–1665), professor of ethics at the\nUniversity of Leiden, had formulated it in his (1653) inaugural\nlecture De vera philosophandi libertate. During his one-year\nstay in Leiden, Sturm also visited Baruch de Spinoza\n(1632–1677). In 1661, Sturm returned to Jena via Amsterdam,\nHamburg, Lower Saxony, Magdeburg, and Leipzig. In Jena, he spent one\nmore year on the study of theology. \nIn 1662, Sturm returned to his former benefactor, Daniel Wülfer,\ninstructing his sons, but also conducting his own philosophical\nstudies. Only in 1664 was Sturm able to find a decent employment as\npriest of Deiningen and (from 1667 onwards) Klosterzimmern, allowing\nhim to settle and start a family. \nOn August 15, 1669 Sturm was offered a position as professor of\nmathematics and physics at the University of Altdorf, which he took\nover from Abdias Trew (1597–1669). Sturm held this position\nuntil his death in 1703. His most famous students were the Swiss\npolyhistor Johann Jakob Scheuchzer (1672–1733); Johann Gabriel\nDoppelmayr (1671–1750), a German mathematician, natural\nphilosopher and encyclopedist; Johann Heinrich Müller\n(1671–1731), one of Sturm’s successors to the chair of\nmathematics and physics at the University of Altdorf; Martin Knorre\n(1657–1699); and Georg Albrecht Hamberger (1662–1716), a\nteacher of Christian Wolff (1679–1754). Besides his\nprofessorship, Sturm was twice the rector of the University of\nAltdorf, and nine times the dean of the faculty of philosophy. \nSturm was married three times: his first wife was Barbara Johanna\nKesler. They married in 1664. She died in 1679. His second wife was\nMaria Salome Höchstetter. They married in 1680. She died in 1691.\nHis third wife was Dorothea Elisabeth Göring. They married in\n1692 and she outlived Sturm. Sturm had 13 children, Leonhard Christoph\nSturm being the most famous one. \nSturm died in Altdorf on December 25, 1703 from the consequences of a\nstroke he had suffered two months earlier. He was said to be  \na pious, honest, kind, upright man, of clear speech, very eager in\n[the search for] justice and truth, and the successful renovator of\nmathematical studies. (Brucker 1766: 770)  \nIn his eulogy on Sturm, Georg Paul Rötenbeck, who was ordinary\nprofessor of political science and logic at the University of Altdorf\nand whose daughter was married to Sturm’s son Leonhard\nChristoph, portrays Sturm as humble, decent, impartial, duteous,\npatient, and godly. Furthermore, Sturm is venerated as a brilliant\nphilosopher and mathematician as well as a good family father (Hermann\n& Platz 2003: 10–27). \nThroughout his life as professor of mathematics and physics at the\nUniversity of Altdorf, Sturm produced a variety of works, including\nmathematical textbooks, a colorful set of disputations, works on\nastronomy (aimed at discrediting astrology), and calendars. However,\nSturm’s core interest concerned natural philosophy. He published\nthree systematic treatises on physics, the Physica\nConciliatrix (PC, 1684), the Physica Electiva sive\nHypothetica (PE, 1697/1722) and the posthumously published\nCompendium Physicae Modernae Sanioris (CPMS, 1704). \nThe Physica Electiva is Sturm’s masterpiece. It is\ndivided into three parts: a physica generalis (general\nphysics) that lays down the foundations of Sturm’s system and\nincludes his discussion of key metaphysical themes such as the nature\nof matter, form, and causation; a physica specialis (special\nphysics) that covers the main phenomena of the supralunary and the\nsublunary world; and a physica specialissima (very special\nphysics) that is devoted to the study of life and human beings. During\nhis life, Sturm managed to published only the physica\ngeneralis. The physica specialis was published\nposthumously by Christian Wolff in 1722. The third part has never been\npublished. It has been alleged that it were held in manuscript form by\nthe city library of Nuremberg (Gaab, in Gaab et al. 2004). Based on\narchival research conducted by one of the authors (C. Henkel) in the\ncity library of Nuremberg in October 2019, he thinks no such\nmanuscript exists there. However, the city library of Nuremberg holds\nwhat he takes to be study notes of Sturm’s students on courses\nin natural \n philosophy.[1] \nIn line with his eclectic approach to philosophy (see\n sect. 2),\n Sturm surveys and builds upon a wide range of sources. They include\npre-Socratic authors, such as Thales, Pythagoras, Heraclitus,\nParmenides, Empedocles, and Democritus as well as philosophers of the\nclassical period, such as Hippocrates, Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus,\nEuclid, and Archimedes. Due to the Aristotelian curriculum dominating\nthe life of early modern academic philosophers, Sturm draws upon\nAristotle (in particular his Physics) more often than upon any other\nauthor. Furthermore, Sturm avails himself of Roman philosophers both\nStoic, such as Cicero, Seneca, Pliny the Elder, and Plutarch, and\nSceptic, such as Sextus Empiricus and Aulus Gellius. Other authors of\nthe era include Potamon of Alexandria, whom Sturm takes to be the\nfirst eclectic philosopher; Galen, as well as Diogenes Laërtius,\nan important source for early modern philosophers to study the\nphilosophers of antiquity. \nFurthermore, Sturm knows the Church Fathers, that is, he mentions\nClemens of Alexandria, Origen of Alexandria, and Lucius Caecilius\nFirmianus Lactantius. He takes the Church Fathers to be eclectics. \nSturm is well-versed in the Aristotelian commentary tradition\nincluding the Greek commentators rediscovered in the Renaissance\n(Schmitt 1983), such as Iamblichus, Alexander of Aphrodisias,\nThemistius, Ammonius Hermeae, Simplicius of Cilicia, Philoponus (John\nthe Grammarian), and Olympiodorus the Younger; the Arab commentators,\nsuch as Avicenna and Averroës; as well as the Latin commentators,\nsuch as Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus, Durandus of St.\nPourçain, and William of Ockham. Following a general line of\nthought manifesting itself in the Renaissance among both Aristotelian\nand Humanist thinkers (Schmitt 1983), Sturm takes the Greek\ncommentators to be more reliable and true to the views of Aristotle\nhimself than the Latin commentators (PE I: preface). \nSturm draws extensively on Aristotelian thinkers ranging from medieval\nscholastic authors, such as Gabriel Biel, to Renaissance and late\nearly modern scholastic authors. The latter include Italian\nphilosophers, for instance, Julius Caesar Scaliger, Andrea Caesalpino,\nJacopo Zabarella, Giulio Pace, and Francisco Lana de Terzi; Dutch\nphilosophers, such as Gijsbert Voet (Voetius); Spanish and Portuguese\nphilosophers such as Gómez de Pereira, Pedro da Fonseca,\nFrancisco de Toledo, Antonio Rubio, Francisco Suárez, Gabriel\nVásquez, Pedro Hurtado de Mendoza, and Rodrigo de Arriaga;\nFrench philosophers, such as Samuel Maresius, Honoré Fabri,\nJean Baptiste Du Hamel, and Pierre Daniel Huet; English philosophers,\nsuch as John Case and Gilbert Jack (Jacchaeus); and German\nPhilosophers, such as Daniel Sennert, Christoph Scheibler, Johannes\nZeisold, Johann Sperling, Jakob Thomasius, and Erhard Weigel. Sturm\nknows the German academic philosophical landscape very well, since\nthese philosophers were influential in their respective fields (see\nWundt 1938), or since they were either Sturm’s colleagues or\nteachers. The latter is true of Zeisold and Weigel. \nIn addition, Sturm is acquainted with humanist thinkers, such as\nLorenzo Valla, Juan Louis Vives, Philip Melanchthon, and Pierre de la\nRamée. Furthermore, his sources include early modern natural\nphilosophers: microscopists, such as Marcello Malpighi, Antonie\nPhilips van Leeuwenhoek, and Nehemiah Grew, but also astronomers such\nas Nicolaus Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Galileo Galilei. Sturm is also\nfamiliar with Renaissance and early modern physicians and anatomists\nsuch as Jean Fernel, William Harvey, Claude Perrault, and Jean\nPecquet. \nSturm is acquainted with alchemist sources, such as the Corpus\nHermeticum, Paracelsus, Jan Baptista van Helmont, and Athanasius\nKircher, as well as atomists such as Lucretius and Pierre Gassendi,\nnone of whom he looks upon very favorably. \nConcerning seventeenth-century philosophers, Sturm builds upon Francis\nBacon and Gerrit Janszoon Vos (Vossius) regarding his eclectic\nphilosophy and scientific method. He argues against Spinoza’s\nand Leibniz’s conception of nature, and mentions Thomas Hobbes,\nKenelm Digby, Blaise Pascal, and Isaac Newton in passing. Sturm also\nargues against the Cambridge Platonists, such as Henry More and\nRalph Cudworth. In contrast, he builds upon Cartesian thought, using\nRené Descartes, Johann Clauberg, Géraud de Cordemoy,\nLouis de la Forge, Antoine le Grand, and Nicolas Malebranche as \nsources.\nCordemoy, La Forge Malebranche, and the Christian mystic Pierre Poiret\ninspire Sturm’s case in favor of occasionalism. \nFinally, Sturm corresponded extensively with members of the Royal\nSociety, such as John Wallis, Robert Boyle, and Robert Hooke. It is in\nBoyle that he finds backup for his own position of the passivity of\nnature in the controversy with Leibniz and Schelhammer (see\nbelow). \nToday, Sturm is most commonly remembered as the polemical target of\nLeibniz’s essay De Ipsa Natura (1698), which is part of\nan articulated controversy between Sturm and Leibniz on whether nature\ncan be considered endowed with active principles (a claim denied by\nSturm and defended by Leibniz). In fact, Leibniz and Sturm knew of one\nanother, since they were both students of Erhard Weigel (Lemanski\n2018). Presumably, they met in the 1660s, maybe when Leibniz was at\nAltdorf University in 1666 or when he was the secretary of the\nalchemical society in Nuremberg in 1667 (for Leibniz life, see Arthur\n2014: x–xvi). \nIn his De Ipsa Natura, Leibniz presents Sturm as a supporter\nof Malebranche’s occasionalism. This charge is partially correct\ninsofar as Sturm does claim, like Malebranche, that God is the only\nactive cause operating in nature. However, Leibniz oversimplifies\nSturm’s position. Sturm’s account of passive forms is in\nfact different from Malebranche’s occasionalism for the role\nthat it attributes to finite forms in the explanation of natural\nphenomena and for the relatively minor role that the notion of the\nlaws of nature plays in Sturm’s account (see\n sect. 3).  More generally, Sturm’s project is diametrically opposed to\nLeibniz’s. At the core of Leibniz’s criticisms is his\ncommitment to the traditional scholastic view that the notions of\nsubstance and action are deeply interconnected (e.g. Leibniz 1989,\n160). The commitment to the notion of action as the fundamental ground\nto think about the very nature of substances underpins Leibniz’s\nmain objections to Sturm’s account of the passivity of\nforms. Leibniz cannot accept that any natural being could ever be\nadequately conceived, or taken to have any ontological consistency,\nwithout referring to some kind of activity. However, Sturm rejects\nprecisely Leibniz’s fundamental commitment to activity as the\nontological ground of substances. As a result, Sturm hardly offers\nLeibniz any answer that would be satisfying from the latter’s\npoint of view. \nThe clash of fundamental philosophical intuitions that surfaces in the\nexchange between Leibniz and Sturm is particularly interesting with\nregard to the complex evolution of early modern philosophy across the\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries (Sangiacomo 2020a and 2020b). In\na sense, Leibniz voices the main objection that can be raised against\nSturm; namely, without some active principle “mechanical\nforms” are just idle constructions that cannot perform any\ngenuine explanatory role.  However, Sturm’s consistent way of\nmaintaining that explanation does not require any reference\nto intrinsic causal powers points, in fact, to an alternative account\nof causation and causal explanations altogether, which was emerging at\nthe time (Carraud 2002; Sangiacomo 2019, 2020c). \nDespite Leibniz opposing Sturm’s metaphysics and natural\nphilosophy, he was appreciative of and influenced by Sturm’s\n(and Weigel’s) developments in logic (Lemanski 2018).\nFurthermore, Leibniz’s major disciple in Germany, Christian\nWolff, was very much fond of Sturm himself. So much so that it was\nWolff who supported the publication of the pars specialis of\nSturm’s PE and provided a preface to it. Wolff was probably\nfamiliar with Sturm due to Wolff’s former teacher, Georg\nAlbrecht Hamberger, who in turn had studied with Sturm (Gaab, in Gaab\net al. 2004: 48f). \nIn his preface, Wolff is full of praise for Sturm, especially because\nhe believes to find in Sturm’s method an anticipation of his own\ntripartite division of knowledge into historical knowledge or\nknowledge of facts, philosophical knowledge or knowledge of causes,\nand mathematical knowledge or knowledge of the quantities of things\nput down in the first chapter of the Philosophia Rationalis\n(see\n SEP entry on Christian Wolff,\n sects. 3 and 7). However, Wolff is aware that mathematical\nquantification does not figure in Sturm’s method as prominently\nas the other two types of knowledge. Besides, Wolff compliments Sturm\nfor establishing experimental teaching (collegia) — an\nacademic novelty. Moreover, he looks very favorably on Sturm’s\nthree physics, praising Sturm’s scientific method\n (sect. 2),\n and pointing out the very positive reception of the first part of the\nPE. He laments the absence of a third part (the pars\nspecialissima) of the PE, which was supposed to deal with living\nbeings. Sturm’s death prevented its termination and successive\npublication. However, in order to close this gap, Wolff directs the\nreader to the lecture of Honoré Fabri’s works on plants,\nanimals and human beings. Indeed, Sturm himself had allegedly\nrecommended to the editor to join Fabri’s writings on these\nmatters with the two completed parts of the PE to provide a complete\nphysics. Besides Fabri, in the preliminaries, Wolff directs the reader\nto the works of Gassendi, Clauberg, Du Hamel, La Forge, Cordemoy,\nHarvey, Perrault, Malpighi, Grew, and Ray to obtain knowledge about\nplants, animals, and especially the connection of the mind and the\nbody in the human case. \nSturm’s scientific method aims at providing a complete system of\nnatural philosophy in which (potentially) all natural phenomena can\nreceive satisfying causal explanations based on available observations\nand by taking into account the most perspicuous hypotheses advanced.\nSturm’s method consists of three main steps, which also provide\nthe recurrent pattern used to discuss all topics covered in the\nPhysica\n Electiva.[2] \nThe first step consists in collecting phenomena, either reported by\nother natural philosophers or encountered by means of observation or\nexperimentation itself. They need to be reported faithfully\n(fideliter), by accurately presenting the circumstances under\nwhich the phenomena obtained (PE I: preface, art. 3.4). \nSturm was committed to the new emerging experimental natural\nphilosophy and he was among the first university professors in Germany\nto introduce an experimental approach on an academic level. Inspired\nby the experimental method advanced by Bacon and Boyle, he offered\nregular yet private experimental collegia (teaching). His\nCollegium experimentale sive curiosum (1676/1685) reveals\nthat Sturm was familiar with the state of the art of experimental\nnatural science, putting to good use the new instruments available at\nthe time; namely, the telescope, microscope, air pump, diver’s\nbell, etc. Furthermore, hypotheses (the basis of theory-building) are\nmeasured both against their congruence with phenomena and the results\nof experiments. Paradigmatic experimenters for Sturm are Otto von\nGuericke, Caspar Schott, and Robert Boyle. \nHowever, Sturm does not content himself with putting forth a mere\nnatural history, a mere listing of things found in nature, or curious\nexperimental results. Natural philosophy must provide deeper causal\nexplanations for why the phenomena are such as they are and why they\noccur. To achieve this goal, the natural philosopher should take stock\nof experimental findings and available observations and investigate\nsuitable hypotheses to explain them. \nThe second step, hence, consists in collecting and presenting with the\nsame faithfulness old and new hypotheses that have been suggested to\naccount for the phenomena. Sturm meticulously presents hypotheses old\nand new, from Pre-Socratic to seventeenth-century authors (see\n sect. 1.2).\n Sturm shows himself to be an assiduous, diligent reader of the\nnatural philosophy available at his time. His knowledge of more and\neven less prominent authors is impressive and precise. \nSturm’s last physics, the Compendium Physicae Modernae\nSanioris (CPMS), makes particularly clear that hypotheses have a\nplace in between observations by the senses and certainties revealed\nby the demonstrative method. He points out that some things are\nobvious, in that they are observed by the senses or by means of\nexperiments including the use of newly invented instruments (CPMS:\n2f). Some things are merely conjectured rather than infallibly\ndemonstrated (supponuntur verius & conjiciuntur, quam\ninfallibiliter demonstratur) (CPMS: 3). Some are certain, in the\nsense that phenomena and hypotheses align, that is, they are  \ndeduced (deducuntur) from phenomena and hypotheses in such a\nway by means of the demonstrative method that due to the ubiquitous\nharmonizing correspondence itself of the phenomena with the\nhypotheses, by means of a certain demonstrative regress, the things\nthat had been assumed in a way seemingly true\n(verosimiliter), ascend to (evadent) truth and\ncertainty. (CPMS: 3f) \nThe third step of Sturm’s method aims at selection and\nreconciliation of different hypotheses and at the final concocting of\na satisfying account of the phenomena at stake. Sturm’s goal is\nto distil what is good and reasonable while discarding\npseudo-explanations, prejudices and preconceived notions. This step is\napproached mainly through critical investigation, rational discussion\nand logical inference. In this sense, it is the more philosophical or\nspeculative part of Sturm’s method. The goal of this third step\nis thus to critically assess and integrate the hypotheses\ncollected. \nAt the beginning of his preface to the PE (PE I: art. 3.1), Sturm\n(possibly inspired by Boyle and Mariotte) extensively investigates\ncriteria good hypotheses have to meet. They have to have a reasonable\ndegree of possibility and show the connection among phenomena. They\nhave to satisfy the circumstances that obtain. A hypothesis is better\nin case it can accommodate more phenomena and notable circumstances.\nSimpler hypotheses should be preferred. Hence, Sturm avails himself of\nOckham’s razor in choosing among hypotheses. The reasoning\nbehind this is that simple hypotheses mirror God’s ways which\nare simple (PE I: preface, art. 3.1). God as the wisest creator of\nnature (Opificem naturae Sapientissimum) designed the world\nby simple means which have to be taken into consideration when\nstudying nature and its design. Furthermore, good hypotheses should\nneither conflict with phenomena, other established hypotheses nor\nevident principles (PE I: preface, art. 3.2). Finally, Sturm points\nout that hypotheses have to satisfy not only the intellect but also\nthe imagination and the senses (PE I: preface, art. 3.3).\nSturm’s reasoning here is that all natural phenomena are\nphenomena pertaining the world of extension and its modifications like\nshape and motion. The senses and the imagination are first and\nforemost concerned with the realm of extended beings, and therefore to\nassess the aptness of hypotheses about natural phenomena, one needs to\nconsult both of these faculties. Mere abstract conceptual reflection\nabout nature as is characteristic of the scholastics (Sturm thinks) is\nnot sufficient, since worldly phenomena are most proximate to and\npalpable by the senses and the imagination (PE I: preface, art\n3.3). \nIn this three-step method, the presentation of phenomena establishes\nthe explanandum, the hypotheses cover some ground towards\napproximating a solution. But since these different hypotheses either\ncontradict or run parallel to one another, a true explanation has to\nselect from existing theories what is true, reject what is false, and\nadd what needs be added. This brings us to Sturm’s\n eclecticism.[3] \nThe eclectic approach consists in nothing other than  \nto select and adopt (sibi sumere) from all sects of\nPhilosophers that which is true, having left behind what is false and\nerroneous. (PE I: preface, art. 2.1)  \nSturm encountered the eclectic method during his one-year stay in\nLeiden in 1660 probably inspired by Henricus Bornius. Both the preface\nof Sturm’s Physica Electiva and his disputation De\nPhilosophia Sectaria & Electiva (DSE; in his 1686\nPhilosophia Eclectica) held in 1679 are pleas for\neclecticism, which contrasts sharply with sectarian philosophy.\nAccording to Sturm, the whole of philosophers — bracketing\nsceptics and doubters (sceptios ac dubitatores) — can\nbe subsumed under two classes: sectarians and eclectics (DSE: 3). \nSectarian thinkers are led by an authority on whom they slavishly\ndepend. They do not follow their own reasoning, but spend their time\nabsorbing, reproducing and fiercely defending what they have learned\nex cathedra. Sectarian philosophers do not follow the truth\nof what is being said, but the authority of the person who said\nsomething. The most notable sects in Sturm’s days are the\nAristotelians (secta Aristotelica) with its two main\nbranches, namely, the Greek interpreters and the scholastic\ncommentators; the Cartesians (secta Cartesiana); the\nGassendists (secta Gassendica) reviving Epicurean and\nDemocritean thought; and the Neoplatonists (secta\nNeo-Platonica) (DSE: 13). In his Physica Electiva, Sturm\nmentions the alchemical school (the Spagyric school or that\nof the chemists [Chemicorum]) as the fourth main one omitting\nNeo-Platonism (PE I: preface, art. 3.5). \nThe case for eclecticism is made ex negativo by challenging\nsectarianism and positively by bringing to light the strengths of the\neclectic method. Concerning the repudiation of sectarian philosophy,\nSturm argues that adopting a sectarian approach is first of all not a\nnecessity (Sectariae quippe Philosophiae primo nulla est\nnecessitas). It is not the only option (see DSE: 28f). Second,\nfollowing one authority is not only not useful, it is even dangerous\nand damaging to the advancement and augmentation of the sciences. \nIn contrast to this, eclectic philosophers are defined as: \n[T]hose who did not want to hang on to every word of someone, nor\nswear by the words of one master; they knew and collected for their\nstorehouse everything that is true and good from the words and\nwritings of whatever teachers (Doctorum) not convinced by the\nauthority of the person teaching but by the weight of the arguments\nand demonstrations; even more they added from themselves as much as\nthey could; they make it their business (sustineant) to see\nwith their own rather than with someone else’s eyes. (DSE: 3f;\nsee also DSE: 6, 28) \nThe eclectic method acknowledges the feebleness of the human mind, its\nproclivity to err (DSE: 23). In this it is humbler than sectarian\nphilosophy which assumes to find all the truths in one author. Since\nhumans on their own tend to misjudge things or make mistakes, they\ndepend on one another as correctives. The scientific study of nature\nif it is to succeed, hence, becomes a collective endeavor: \nBy the name of the eclectic philosophers we understand in this whole\ntreatise no others than those, who do not reject without a difference\nall the things that are found (inventa) and left\n(tradita) by the heads of different sects, and who are not so\nmoved by the authority of one leader that they do accept all of his\nutterances and bons mots (dicteria), but who\nacknowledge the feebleness (imbecillitatem) of the human mind\n(humani ingenii), which makes it apparent that all depths of\nnature and reason cannot be exhausted by one or a few men; they\npersuade themselves that the truth can be only viewed in part, and\nthat the sciences are to be advanced and stabilized by means of united\npowers (junctis viribus) and communicated advice\n(communicato consilio). (DSE: 7f) \nIt should be stressed that although eclecticism means collecting what\nis good in other authors, it does not just aim at a mere collection of\ntrue or probable hypotheses, but instead at the formulation of a\ncoherent system of natural philosophy (PE I: preface, art. 3.2).\nEclecticism, in Sturm’s eyes, explicitly invites the correction,\nemendation and augmentation of existing theories (DSE: 48, 69). It is\na philosophical approach more useful and appropriate for the\nadvancement of the sciences than thinking in line with one author as\nthe sectarians do (DSE: 14). \nFinally, Sturm’s method conceives of natural philosophy as a\ndynamic project in a state of constant transformation. To illustrate\nthis point, Sturm compares philosophy as a whole to a ship: it is\nsomewhat complete, though undergoing constant changes and mending.\nBoth philosophy and a ship in use need to be fixed from time to time.\nOld, used-up parts (hypotheses in the case of philosophy, planks in\nthe case of the ship) have to go to be replaced by new parts fit to\nallow both to advance (CPMS: 79). Philosophy is a never ending\nproject. It can only approximate truth, getting closer and closer. No\nsingle natural philosopher has or could have exhausted and\nsufficiently explained the phenomena obtaining in nature. Hence, what\nneeds to be done is to diligently assess and select what is good and\ntrue in other philosophers, adding what needs to be added. New\nphenomena are being discovered, new competing hypotheses are being\ndeveloped to explain them. They too need to be assessed. What is\nreasonable remains. What is not able to stand up to the demands of a\ngood hypothesis will have to go. The experimental study of nature\nproceeds, too. New instruments are being developed raising new\nchallenges to old hypotheses. The vastness of nature, the manifold of\nits phenomena and the fact that causes cannot be observed but only\nconjectured add to the difficulty of the natural philosopher’s\ntask. It would indeed be temerity and arrogance to think that one has\nexplained all there needs to be explained in nature (CPMS: 67).\nTherefore, Sturm is making a case for the open-endedness of natural\nphilosophy. Its goal is to know oneself, to know the world, and\nultimately to know God (PE I: preface, art. 4.5; CPMS: 8). A goal that\nis not reachable within the life span of a human being, but a goal\nworth striving for. \nIn the theoretical part (physica generalis) of his\nPhysica Electiva, Sturm sets down the metaphysical foundations\nof his system. In a nutshell, Sturm argues that the whole of nature\n(human and angelic minds set aside) can be explained by two\nprinciples: matter and its modes, which are material forms. Both these\nprinciples are causally passive and shaped by local motion. Forms, in\nparticular, provide the specific reasons why certain phenomena are\nproduced in a certain way, but they do not include the causal powers\nthat bring these phenomena about. That power comes only from God, who\nis the universal and omnipresent cause acting in nature. In order to\nsupport this picture, Sturm gives a number of original twists to an\nargumentative strategy already exploited by other occasionalist\nauthors, while providing at the same time a more eclectic and broader\nrationale for endorsing an occasionalist metaphysics. To deepen\nSturm’s account, three main points deserve special attention:\n(1) the justification for passive forms as modes of matter;\n(2) why God’s causal power is directly needed to bring about\nnatural phenomena; and (3) the role that passive forms play in\nscientific explanations. \n(1) Early modern natural philosophers agree with their Scholastic\nopponents in granting that matter is utterly passive and devoid of\nefficacious causal powers. Sturm takes stock of this point, joining\nDescartes and other Cartesians in defining matter in terms of pure\nextension (res extensa) and motion as local motion. However,\nearly modern natural philosophers disagreed with Scholastics and among\nthemselves about the notion of ‘form’, whether there could\nbe any ‘substantial form’ and if rejecting substantial\nforms would lead to discard all causal powers in finite beings. \nSturm’s position in this debate is clear-cut. Sturm argues that\nforms are nothing but modes of matter (i.e., modifications of\nan extended substance), and since matter is causally passive, forms\nare causally passive, too. Sturm agrees with many other early modern\nanti-Scholastic philosophers in dismissing scholastic substantial\nforms. \nSturm’s argument for rejecting substantial forms is based on a\ntrilemma, according to which forms are either (i) purely material\nbeings, (ii) purely spiritual beings distinct from matter, or (iii) a\nkind of being that is in between purely material and purely immaterial\nsubstances. \nThe first option leads directly to Sturm’s own view. If\nsubstantial forms are purely material beings, they cannot be\nsubstances in themselves because the form of a material body cannot be\nanother separate material body, given that forms operate in virtue of\ntheir intimate union with the matter of the substance of which they\nare the form. It follows that if substantial forms are purely\nmaterial, then they have to be conceived as modes of matter. \nThe second option is relevant because later scholastic authors (such\nas Suárez) tended to use the rational soul as the prototype to\nunderstand natural substantial forms as well. However, the rational\nsoul is a self-standing spiritual substance that can exist and be\nconceived independently from the body with which it is united. This\nentails that the rational soul is not the form of the body,\nbut simply a different, independent substance that is united with the\nbody itself. Hence (pace scholastics), the case of the human\nrational soul cannot be used as a model to conceptualize\n‘substantial forms’ in other (non-human) natural beings\n(PE I: 94). \nSturm’s argument against the third option of the trilemma runs\nas follows. If one defines (as scholastics usually do) a substantial\nform in terms of the role that the form plays in explaining and\naccounting for the nature of composite beings, then what is called a\n‘substantial form’ cannot belong to the ontological\ncategory of a substance, but only to the category of\n‘relatives’ or relational things. Sturm stresses that\n“the entire nature of a form generally and essentially consists\nof a relation” (PE I: 94). Forms are not beings in themselves,\nbut ways in which certain beings operate and undergo changes.\nAgainst the third option of the trilemma, Sturm maintains that forms\nare not the kind of being that can be conceived of or exist\nindependently from the being that they inform. Natural forms\ncannot be understood as a kind of substance or being\nintermediate between material and spiritual substances because forms\nare not substances in the first place. Since natural forms\nare relational beings they cannot be substances, and\nthus the very idea of a ‘substantial form’ is a chimera, a\ncategory mistake. The only viable option left is thus the one defended\nby Sturm himself: forms are modes of matter, and since matter is\ncausally passive, forms are causally passive as well. \n(2) This conclusion requires an account of how natural phenomena can\ntake place if nothing in nature is endowed with active causal powers.\nAccording to Sturm, the origin of natural causality lies in God\nhimself. God is the substance defined by pure activity, and He is the\nonly truly efficient cause of all motion in the world: \nOnly God’s most efficacious volition is that truly acting power\n(virtutem), which moves while not being moved, which\nrigorously speaking moves, which moves one body by means of\n(per) another, which moves the whole corporeal world, its\nparts, some by means of (per) others, and in this way He\nbrings about (efficiat) every one of the natural effects that\nhappens in even the most remote corners of the Universe by means of\nhis sole immediate power. (PE I: 164) \nGod is the “requiring cause” (causam exigentem,\nPE I: 161) of natural phenomena. This means that when God\nwants something to happen then the effect obtains. However,\nSturm also maintains that God’s will does not operate in nature\nthrough its “absolute power” (potentia absoluta)\nbut rather by following what Sturm calls “respective or\nhypothetical power” (potentia respectiva &\nhypothetica): \nHere I established that God acts and operates in the whole of nature,\nnot on the basis of his absolute power (which obtains whatever he\nwants without hindrances and in the most perfect way), but on the\nbasis of a respective and hypothetical power, whose exercise God\nhimself has (in the most free way) subordinated to certain conditions\nof matter or of the human mind. (PE I: 178) \nGod did not establish to elicit effects absolutely by his mere act of\nfree will. Rather, God freely subordinated his own actions to the\nobtainment of certain specific conditions, namely, certain states of\nnatural beings or of human minds. Sturm does not extensively use the\nMalebranchian terminology of occasional causes, but he does explicitly\nequate occasional causes with sine quibus non causes (PE I:\n117). A sine qua non cause is a (counterfactually) necessary\ncondition for the production of a certain effect, although the\nsine qua non cause does not truly contribute to its\nproduction in virtue of any active power it possesses (see Sangiacomo\n2019). Sturm’s account of God’s hypothetical power entails\nthat all natural forms are sine quibus non conditions for the\nproduction of natural effects, in the sense that they do not\ncontribute in virtue of any active power they might have (since they\nhave none), but rather because God (freely) established to bring about\ncertain effects as consequences of certain modifications (i.e., forms)\nof matter. Since (what Malebranche calls) ‘occasional\ncauses’ can be understood in terms of sine qua non\ncausation, and since Sturm maintains that all natural forms work as\nsine quibus non causes of natural effects, it seems safe to\nconclude that Sturm supports a version of occasionalism. \nHence, Sturm’s strategy achieves its goal: matter is causally\npassive, and material forms are passive as well. In order to account\nfor the changes observed in nature, it is necessary to locate a source\nfor causal activity. However, this source cannot be found anywhere in\nthe natural world itself. God is thus the only candidate left to\naccount for the causal active power needed to bring about natural\nphenomena. God’s power, however, is only responsible for the\nfact that natural phenomena are brought about. The specific\nreason why they are such and such is to be located in the\nspecific features of passive forms themselves. In this respect,\nGod’s involvement in nature plays only a metaphysical grounding\nfunction and it is not supposed to replace, but rather to justify, the\nneed to carefully investigate the mechanical structures of passive\nforms. \nSturm’s occasionalism, however, is quite peculiar, especially as\ncompared to Malebranche’s more familiar version of\noccasionalism. A crucial feature of Malebranche’s occasionalism\nis the role that the laws of nature play in accounting for natural\nphenomena. According to him, natural beings do not have any causal\npowers and can be occasions of their effects only in virtue of the\nlaws of nature established by God. In contrast, Sturm takes God to\nestablish the whole set of counterfactually necessary conditionals\nthat determine which effects will obtain when certain conditions are\nin place in nature. These conditions are passive forms themselves,\nwhich then play the role of explanantia of natural\nphenomena. \n(3) Sturm’s account of passive forms breaks with the idea that\nexplanatory principles in natural philosophy must also account for the\nactive power that brings phenomena about. In this sense, Sturm\ndismisses the idea that causal explanations must be based on active\npowers intrinsic to the natural agents themselves. According to Sturm,\nall phenomena are brought about by God himself. But God’s power\nbeing indifferent, differences among phenomena depend on passive\nforms, which operate as sine quibus non conditions for their\nproduction. This means that the explanandum in natural\nphenomena is not the fact that something is brought about, but rather\nthe specific characteristics of what is brought about. God’s\npower explains that something (in general) is brought about, but only\npassive forms explain what is brought about in particular and how. The\nexplanandum in natural phenomena is thus the specificity of\nthe phenomenon at stake, and the explanans of this phenomenon\nare passive forms, which are a matter of empirical investigation. \nSturm’s approach combines the strengths of both the scholastic\nand seventeenth-century mechanist approach in order to remedy their\nreciprocal shortcomings. Passive mechanical forms (as\nAristotelian-scholastic forms) are particular principles of\nexplanation that can be used to account for different specific\nphenomena. At the same time, passive mechanical forms (as mechanical\nprinciples) are ontologically nothing but modes of matter shaped by\nmotion. Passive forms are different among themselves but they\nare all ontologically shaped by the same universal principles, which\nmake explanations based on passive mechanical forms homogenous and\nuniform (from a conceptual point of view) without making them too\ngeneral and abstract. \nSturm’s approach has at least two important implications: (i)\nthe integration of teleology and final causation in a mechanist\nnatural philosophy; and (ii) the marginalization of the laws of nature\ntherein. \nSturm is a strenuous defender of natural teleology and final causes.\nIn the chapter dedicated to final causes in the PE, Sturm presents to\nthe reader numerous phenomena which are supposed to back up or at\nleast make her inclined to accept the existence of teleology in nature\nas well as the necessity to study it. Sturm mentions inter\nalia bodily organs performing certain functions (the eyes are\nthere to see; the heart pumps blood through the body) and the\nwell-adaptedness of certain animals; for instance, in the case of\nbirds (geese, ducks, storks) their wings, the lightness of their\nbones, and the possession of a certain type of beak. According to\nSturm, ends and uses are an inextricable part of the world as a whole\nand of its parts (PE I: 226). Sturm’s passive forms thus retain\nthe teleological connotation that Aristotelian forms already had,\nfitting it into a mechanist picture of the universe. Forms are\nstructures of matter aimed at producing certain effects rather than\nothers. They are not only the efficient (passive) conditions for these\neffects to obtain, but also the final (passive) principles that\nexplain them. Properly speaking, God himself, once again, is the sole\nfinal cause in nature, since God is the one who designed,\nplanned and carried out the whole of nature as a gigantic and most\nperfect clockwork. \nSturm’s emphasis on forms has its counterpart in his\nmarginalization of the role that the laws of nature play in his\nnatural philosophy and in scientific explanations. Sturm puts forward\nonly two very general laws, one concerning the communication of motion\n(PE I: 164) and the other concerning the mind-body union (PE I:\n858–859). Focusing on the conservation of motion, it is\nimportant to stress that this law is not supposed to explain what\nspecific features different specific bodies can have, nor does Sturm\never suggest that the variety of finite things could follow from a\nconsideration of this (or any other) law alone. Rather, the law of the\nconservation of the quantity of motion simply constrains the effects\nof every natural phenomenon (namely, the fact that motion cannot be\ndissipated during impacts but must be always conserved in the whole of\nthe universe). Remarkably, Sturm also mentions that this law is not\ndeduced a priori from purely metaphysical considerations (as\nis the case in Descartes’ deduction of conservation from the\nnature of God’s immutability), but rather only a\nposteriori on the basis of empirical observations. As an\nempirical regularity derived from experience, Sturm’s\nconservation law does not have the same strong metaphysical\nconnotations of Malebranche’s laws of nature (which are grounded\nin a consideration of God’s attributes of simplicity and\nwisdom), nor does it play any significant role in the explanation of\nparticular phenomena.","contact.mail":"a.sangiacomo@rug.nl","contact.domain":"rug.nl"},{"date.published":"2020-03-05","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/johann-sturm/","author1":"Andrea Sangiacomo","author2":"Christian Henkel","entry":"johann-sturm","body.text":"\n\n\nJohann Christoph Sturm (1635–1703) was an eclectic German\nphilosopher, professor at the University of Altdorf, one of the first\nexperimental physicists, a mathematician, astronomer,\ncalendariographer, and Lutheran priest. He was a correspondent of\nRobert Boyle (1627–1691) and Gottfried Leibniz\n(1646–1716), among others. Sturm’s thought mirrors the\ncomplex interplay between debates in metaphysics, natural philosophy,\nand theology that characterize the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury.\n\n\nIn his numerous academic works, Sturm forcefully defends the use of\nthe experimental method in natural philosophy. He advocates an\ninclusive and open-minded examination of old and new philosophical\ntheories in order to find the best explanations for observed\nphenomena. In metaphysics, Sturm is one of the most outspoken\nsupporters of occasionalism, the theory according to which finite\nbeings lack genuine causal powers and work only as occasions for\nGod’s causal intervention in nature. While occasionalism was\ndeveloped before Sturm by a number of other authors, Sturm gives his\nown original twist to it by making it the foundation of his system of\nnatural philosophy.\n\n\nSturm was born in Hilpoltstein close to Nuremberg on November 3, 1635\nin the midst of the Thirty Years War (1618–1648) which\ndevastated mainly those areas that were to later constitute the\nterritory of Germany. Sturm’s father, Johann Eucharius Sturm,\nwas a tailor, valet, treasurer, and custodian of the silverware at the\ncourt of Count Palatine Johann-Friedrich of Pfalz-Hilpoltstein.\nSturm’s mother was Gertraud Bock, daughter of Konrad Bock,\ncountry parson of Liebenstadt. During his infancy, Sturm learned Latin\nand other (fine) arts from the court chaplain (concionator),\nJohann Jakob Beurer. \nWhen the Count Palatine Johann-Friedrich (himself a Protestant) died\nin 1644, leaving no heir to the throne, his territory devolved unto\nhis older brother Wolfgang Wilhelm, who had converted to Catholicism\nin 1613. Although Johann-Friedrich had reached an agreement with his\nbrother that (unlike all other subjects) the courtiers and servants to\nJohann-Friedrich’s court could remain Protestant, this promise\nceased upon his death. As a consequence of the Counter-Reformation,\nall subjects had to become Catholic. Sturm and his family, being\nLutherans and resisting this call, fled the county in 1645. They\nsettled close by in Weißenburg. From 1646 onwards, Sturm\nattended the Latin School in Weißenburg living in the house of\nthe rector, Johannes Hupfer, who took care of him. In 1653, upon the\nadvocacy of Sturm’s father, Daniel Wülfer, priest and dean\nof St. Lorenz, employed Johann Christoph as amanuensis. He supported\nSturm financially and furthered his academic career. Initially, Sturm\nmight have thought about studying at the University of Altdorf, since\nhe enrolled on October 4, 1653. However, he did not take up his\nstudies. \nInstead of studying at the University of Altdorf, Sturm decided to\nread at the University of Jena, enrolling on February 2, 1656. Sturm\nstudied mathematics and physics with both Erhard Weigel\n(1625–1699) and Johann Zeisold (1599–1667). He studied\ntheology with Henning Spoercke. Sturm was awarded the degree of\nmagister philosophiae magna cum laude on January 27, 1658. On\nOctober 10, 1660 Sturm enrolled at the University of Leiden, where he\nstudied philosophy with Johannes De Raey (1622–1702) and\narchitecture privatim with Nicolai Goldmann\n(1611–1665). It was in Leiden that Sturm most likely came into\ncontact with the concept of and the driving force behind the idea of\neclecticism (see\n sect. 2)\n as Henricus Bornius (1617–1665), professor of ethics at the\nUniversity of Leiden, had formulated it in his (1653) inaugural\nlecture De vera philosophandi libertate. During his one-year\nstay in Leiden, Sturm also visited Baruch de Spinoza\n(1632–1677). In 1661, Sturm returned to Jena via Amsterdam,\nHamburg, Lower Saxony, Magdeburg, and Leipzig. In Jena, he spent one\nmore year on the study of theology. \nIn 1662, Sturm returned to his former benefactor, Daniel Wülfer,\ninstructing his sons, but also conducting his own philosophical\nstudies. Only in 1664 was Sturm able to find a decent employment as\npriest of Deiningen and (from 1667 onwards) Klosterzimmern, allowing\nhim to settle and start a family. \nOn August 15, 1669 Sturm was offered a position as professor of\nmathematics and physics at the University of Altdorf, which he took\nover from Abdias Trew (1597–1669). Sturm held this position\nuntil his death in 1703. His most famous students were the Swiss\npolyhistor Johann Jakob Scheuchzer (1672–1733); Johann Gabriel\nDoppelmayr (1671–1750), a German mathematician, natural\nphilosopher and encyclopedist; Johann Heinrich Müller\n(1671–1731), one of Sturm’s successors to the chair of\nmathematics and physics at the University of Altdorf; Martin Knorre\n(1657–1699); and Georg Albrecht Hamberger (1662–1716), a\nteacher of Christian Wolff (1679–1754). Besides his\nprofessorship, Sturm was twice the rector of the University of\nAltdorf, and nine times the dean of the faculty of philosophy. \nSturm was married three times: his first wife was Barbara Johanna\nKesler. They married in 1664. She died in 1679. His second wife was\nMaria Salome Höchstetter. They married in 1680. She died in 1691.\nHis third wife was Dorothea Elisabeth Göring. They married in\n1692 and she outlived Sturm. Sturm had 13 children, Leonhard Christoph\nSturm being the most famous one. \nSturm died in Altdorf on December 25, 1703 from the consequences of a\nstroke he had suffered two months earlier. He was said to be  \na pious, honest, kind, upright man, of clear speech, very eager in\n[the search for] justice and truth, and the successful renovator of\nmathematical studies. (Brucker 1766: 770)  \nIn his eulogy on Sturm, Georg Paul Rötenbeck, who was ordinary\nprofessor of political science and logic at the University of Altdorf\nand whose daughter was married to Sturm’s son Leonhard\nChristoph, portrays Sturm as humble, decent, impartial, duteous,\npatient, and godly. Furthermore, Sturm is venerated as a brilliant\nphilosopher and mathematician as well as a good family father (Hermann\n& Platz 2003: 10–27). \nThroughout his life as professor of mathematics and physics at the\nUniversity of Altdorf, Sturm produced a variety of works, including\nmathematical textbooks, a colorful set of disputations, works on\nastronomy (aimed at discrediting astrology), and calendars. However,\nSturm’s core interest concerned natural philosophy. He published\nthree systematic treatises on physics, the Physica\nConciliatrix (PC, 1684), the Physica Electiva sive\nHypothetica (PE, 1697/1722) and the posthumously published\nCompendium Physicae Modernae Sanioris (CPMS, 1704). \nThe Physica Electiva is Sturm’s masterpiece. It is\ndivided into three parts: a physica generalis (general\nphysics) that lays down the foundations of Sturm’s system and\nincludes his discussion of key metaphysical themes such as the nature\nof matter, form, and causation; a physica specialis (special\nphysics) that covers the main phenomena of the supralunary and the\nsublunary world; and a physica specialissima (very special\nphysics) that is devoted to the study of life and human beings. During\nhis life, Sturm managed to published only the physica\ngeneralis. The physica specialis was published\nposthumously by Christian Wolff in 1722. The third part has never been\npublished. It has been alleged that it were held in manuscript form by\nthe city library of Nuremberg (Gaab, in Gaab et al. 2004). Based on\narchival research conducted by one of the authors (C. Henkel) in the\ncity library of Nuremberg in October 2019, he thinks no such\nmanuscript exists there. However, the city library of Nuremberg holds\nwhat he takes to be study notes of Sturm’s students on courses\nin natural \n philosophy.[1] \nIn line with his eclectic approach to philosophy (see\n sect. 2),\n Sturm surveys and builds upon a wide range of sources. They include\npre-Socratic authors, such as Thales, Pythagoras, Heraclitus,\nParmenides, Empedocles, and Democritus as well as philosophers of the\nclassical period, such as Hippocrates, Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus,\nEuclid, and Archimedes. Due to the Aristotelian curriculum dominating\nthe life of early modern academic philosophers, Sturm draws upon\nAristotle (in particular his Physics) more often than upon any other\nauthor. Furthermore, Sturm avails himself of Roman philosophers both\nStoic, such as Cicero, Seneca, Pliny the Elder, and Plutarch, and\nSceptic, such as Sextus Empiricus and Aulus Gellius. Other authors of\nthe era include Potamon of Alexandria, whom Sturm takes to be the\nfirst eclectic philosopher; Galen, as well as Diogenes Laërtius,\nan important source for early modern philosophers to study the\nphilosophers of antiquity. \nFurthermore, Sturm knows the Church Fathers, that is, he mentions\nClemens of Alexandria, Origen of Alexandria, and Lucius Caecilius\nFirmianus Lactantius. He takes the Church Fathers to be eclectics. \nSturm is well-versed in the Aristotelian commentary tradition\nincluding the Greek commentators rediscovered in the Renaissance\n(Schmitt 1983), such as Iamblichus, Alexander of Aphrodisias,\nThemistius, Ammonius Hermeae, Simplicius of Cilicia, Philoponus (John\nthe Grammarian), and Olympiodorus the Younger; the Arab commentators,\nsuch as Avicenna and Averroës; as well as the Latin commentators,\nsuch as Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus, Durandus of St.\nPourçain, and William of Ockham. Following a general line of\nthought manifesting itself in the Renaissance among both Aristotelian\nand Humanist thinkers (Schmitt 1983), Sturm takes the Greek\ncommentators to be more reliable and true to the views of Aristotle\nhimself than the Latin commentators (PE I: preface). \nSturm draws extensively on Aristotelian thinkers ranging from medieval\nscholastic authors, such as Gabriel Biel, to Renaissance and late\nearly modern scholastic authors. The latter include Italian\nphilosophers, for instance, Julius Caesar Scaliger, Andrea Caesalpino,\nJacopo Zabarella, Giulio Pace, and Francisco Lana de Terzi; Dutch\nphilosophers, such as Gijsbert Voet (Voetius); Spanish and Portuguese\nphilosophers such as Gómez de Pereira, Pedro da Fonseca,\nFrancisco de Toledo, Antonio Rubio, Francisco Suárez, Gabriel\nVásquez, Pedro Hurtado de Mendoza, and Rodrigo de Arriaga;\nFrench philosophers, such as Samuel Maresius, Honoré Fabri,\nJean Baptiste Du Hamel, and Pierre Daniel Huet; English philosophers,\nsuch as John Case and Gilbert Jack (Jacchaeus); and German\nPhilosophers, such as Daniel Sennert, Christoph Scheibler, Johannes\nZeisold, Johann Sperling, Jakob Thomasius, and Erhard Weigel. Sturm\nknows the German academic philosophical landscape very well, since\nthese philosophers were influential in their respective fields (see\nWundt 1938), or since they were either Sturm’s colleagues or\nteachers. The latter is true of Zeisold and Weigel. \nIn addition, Sturm is acquainted with humanist thinkers, such as\nLorenzo Valla, Juan Louis Vives, Philip Melanchthon, and Pierre de la\nRamée. Furthermore, his sources include early modern natural\nphilosophers: microscopists, such as Marcello Malpighi, Antonie\nPhilips van Leeuwenhoek, and Nehemiah Grew, but also astronomers such\nas Nicolaus Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Galileo Galilei. Sturm is also\nfamiliar with Renaissance and early modern physicians and anatomists\nsuch as Jean Fernel, William Harvey, Claude Perrault, and Jean\nPecquet. \nSturm is acquainted with alchemist sources, such as the Corpus\nHermeticum, Paracelsus, Jan Baptista van Helmont, and Athanasius\nKircher, as well as atomists such as Lucretius and Pierre Gassendi,\nnone of whom he looks upon very favorably. \nConcerning seventeenth-century philosophers, Sturm builds upon Francis\nBacon and Gerrit Janszoon Vos (Vossius) regarding his eclectic\nphilosophy and scientific method. He argues against Spinoza’s\nand Leibniz’s conception of nature, and mentions Thomas Hobbes,\nKenelm Digby, Blaise Pascal, and Isaac Newton in passing. Sturm also\nargues against the Cambridge Platonists, such as Henry More and\nRalph Cudworth. In contrast, he builds upon Cartesian thought, using\nRené Descartes, Johann Clauberg, Géraud de Cordemoy,\nLouis de la Forge, Antoine le Grand, and Nicolas Malebranche as \nsources.\nCordemoy, La Forge Malebranche, and the Christian mystic Pierre Poiret\ninspire Sturm’s case in favor of occasionalism. \nFinally, Sturm corresponded extensively with members of the Royal\nSociety, such as John Wallis, Robert Boyle, and Robert Hooke. It is in\nBoyle that he finds backup for his own position of the passivity of\nnature in the controversy with Leibniz and Schelhammer (see\nbelow). \nToday, Sturm is most commonly remembered as the polemical target of\nLeibniz’s essay De Ipsa Natura (1698), which is part of\nan articulated controversy between Sturm and Leibniz on whether nature\ncan be considered endowed with active principles (a claim denied by\nSturm and defended by Leibniz). In fact, Leibniz and Sturm knew of one\nanother, since they were both students of Erhard Weigel (Lemanski\n2018). Presumably, they met in the 1660s, maybe when Leibniz was at\nAltdorf University in 1666 or when he was the secretary of the\nalchemical society in Nuremberg in 1667 (for Leibniz life, see Arthur\n2014: x–xvi). \nIn his De Ipsa Natura, Leibniz presents Sturm as a supporter\nof Malebranche’s occasionalism. This charge is partially correct\ninsofar as Sturm does claim, like Malebranche, that God is the only\nactive cause operating in nature. However, Leibniz oversimplifies\nSturm’s position. Sturm’s account of passive forms is in\nfact different from Malebranche’s occasionalism for the role\nthat it attributes to finite forms in the explanation of natural\nphenomena and for the relatively minor role that the notion of the\nlaws of nature plays in Sturm’s account (see\n sect. 3).  More generally, Sturm’s project is diametrically opposed to\nLeibniz’s. At the core of Leibniz’s criticisms is his\ncommitment to the traditional scholastic view that the notions of\nsubstance and action are deeply interconnected (e.g. Leibniz 1989,\n160). The commitment to the notion of action as the fundamental ground\nto think about the very nature of substances underpins Leibniz’s\nmain objections to Sturm’s account of the passivity of\nforms. Leibniz cannot accept that any natural being could ever be\nadequately conceived, or taken to have any ontological consistency,\nwithout referring to some kind of activity. However, Sturm rejects\nprecisely Leibniz’s fundamental commitment to activity as the\nontological ground of substances. As a result, Sturm hardly offers\nLeibniz any answer that would be satisfying from the latter’s\npoint of view. \nThe clash of fundamental philosophical intuitions that surfaces in the\nexchange between Leibniz and Sturm is particularly interesting with\nregard to the complex evolution of early modern philosophy across the\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries (Sangiacomo 2020a and 2020b). In\na sense, Leibniz voices the main objection that can be raised against\nSturm; namely, without some active principle “mechanical\nforms” are just idle constructions that cannot perform any\ngenuine explanatory role.  However, Sturm’s consistent way of\nmaintaining that explanation does not require any reference\nto intrinsic causal powers points, in fact, to an alternative account\nof causation and causal explanations altogether, which was emerging at\nthe time (Carraud 2002; Sangiacomo 2019, 2020c). \nDespite Leibniz opposing Sturm’s metaphysics and natural\nphilosophy, he was appreciative of and influenced by Sturm’s\n(and Weigel’s) developments in logic (Lemanski 2018).\nFurthermore, Leibniz’s major disciple in Germany, Christian\nWolff, was very much fond of Sturm himself. So much so that it was\nWolff who supported the publication of the pars specialis of\nSturm’s PE and provided a preface to it. Wolff was probably\nfamiliar with Sturm due to Wolff’s former teacher, Georg\nAlbrecht Hamberger, who in turn had studied with Sturm (Gaab, in Gaab\net al. 2004: 48f). \nIn his preface, Wolff is full of praise for Sturm, especially because\nhe believes to find in Sturm’s method an anticipation of his own\ntripartite division of knowledge into historical knowledge or\nknowledge of facts, philosophical knowledge or knowledge of causes,\nand mathematical knowledge or knowledge of the quantities of things\nput down in the first chapter of the Philosophia Rationalis\n(see\n SEP entry on Christian Wolff,\n sects. 3 and 7). However, Wolff is aware that mathematical\nquantification does not figure in Sturm’s method as prominently\nas the other two types of knowledge. Besides, Wolff compliments Sturm\nfor establishing experimental teaching (collegia) — an\nacademic novelty. Moreover, he looks very favorably on Sturm’s\nthree physics, praising Sturm’s scientific method\n (sect. 2),\n and pointing out the very positive reception of the first part of the\nPE. He laments the absence of a third part (the pars\nspecialissima) of the PE, which was supposed to deal with living\nbeings. Sturm’s death prevented its termination and successive\npublication. However, in order to close this gap, Wolff directs the\nreader to the lecture of Honoré Fabri’s works on plants,\nanimals and human beings. Indeed, Sturm himself had allegedly\nrecommended to the editor to join Fabri’s writings on these\nmatters with the two completed parts of the PE to provide a complete\nphysics. Besides Fabri, in the preliminaries, Wolff directs the reader\nto the works of Gassendi, Clauberg, Du Hamel, La Forge, Cordemoy,\nHarvey, Perrault, Malpighi, Grew, and Ray to obtain knowledge about\nplants, animals, and especially the connection of the mind and the\nbody in the human case. \nSturm’s scientific method aims at providing a complete system of\nnatural philosophy in which (potentially) all natural phenomena can\nreceive satisfying causal explanations based on available observations\nand by taking into account the most perspicuous hypotheses advanced.\nSturm’s method consists of three main steps, which also provide\nthe recurrent pattern used to discuss all topics covered in the\nPhysica\n Electiva.[2] \nThe first step consists in collecting phenomena, either reported by\nother natural philosophers or encountered by means of observation or\nexperimentation itself. They need to be reported faithfully\n(fideliter), by accurately presenting the circumstances under\nwhich the phenomena obtained (PE I: preface, art. 3.4). \nSturm was committed to the new emerging experimental natural\nphilosophy and he was among the first university professors in Germany\nto introduce an experimental approach on an academic level. Inspired\nby the experimental method advanced by Bacon and Boyle, he offered\nregular yet private experimental collegia (teaching). His\nCollegium experimentale sive curiosum (1676/1685) reveals\nthat Sturm was familiar with the state of the art of experimental\nnatural science, putting to good use the new instruments available at\nthe time; namely, the telescope, microscope, air pump, diver’s\nbell, etc. Furthermore, hypotheses (the basis of theory-building) are\nmeasured both against their congruence with phenomena and the results\nof experiments. Paradigmatic experimenters for Sturm are Otto von\nGuericke, Caspar Schott, and Robert Boyle. \nHowever, Sturm does not content himself with putting forth a mere\nnatural history, a mere listing of things found in nature, or curious\nexperimental results. Natural philosophy must provide deeper causal\nexplanations for why the phenomena are such as they are and why they\noccur. To achieve this goal, the natural philosopher should take stock\nof experimental findings and available observations and investigate\nsuitable hypotheses to explain them. \nThe second step, hence, consists in collecting and presenting with the\nsame faithfulness old and new hypotheses that have been suggested to\naccount for the phenomena. Sturm meticulously presents hypotheses old\nand new, from Pre-Socratic to seventeenth-century authors (see\n sect. 1.2).\n Sturm shows himself to be an assiduous, diligent reader of the\nnatural philosophy available at his time. His knowledge of more and\neven less prominent authors is impressive and precise. \nSturm’s last physics, the Compendium Physicae Modernae\nSanioris (CPMS), makes particularly clear that hypotheses have a\nplace in between observations by the senses and certainties revealed\nby the demonstrative method. He points out that some things are\nobvious, in that they are observed by the senses or by means of\nexperiments including the use of newly invented instruments (CPMS:\n2f). Some things are merely conjectured rather than infallibly\ndemonstrated (supponuntur verius & conjiciuntur, quam\ninfallibiliter demonstratur) (CPMS: 3). Some are certain, in the\nsense that phenomena and hypotheses align, that is, they are  \ndeduced (deducuntur) from phenomena and hypotheses in such a\nway by means of the demonstrative method that due to the ubiquitous\nharmonizing correspondence itself of the phenomena with the\nhypotheses, by means of a certain demonstrative regress, the things\nthat had been assumed in a way seemingly true\n(verosimiliter), ascend to (evadent) truth and\ncertainty. (CPMS: 3f) \nThe third step of Sturm’s method aims at selection and\nreconciliation of different hypotheses and at the final concocting of\na satisfying account of the phenomena at stake. Sturm’s goal is\nto distil what is good and reasonable while discarding\npseudo-explanations, prejudices and preconceived notions. This step is\napproached mainly through critical investigation, rational discussion\nand logical inference. In this sense, it is the more philosophical or\nspeculative part of Sturm’s method. The goal of this third step\nis thus to critically assess and integrate the hypotheses\ncollected. \nAt the beginning of his preface to the PE (PE I: art. 3.1), Sturm\n(possibly inspired by Boyle and Mariotte) extensively investigates\ncriteria good hypotheses have to meet. They have to have a reasonable\ndegree of possibility and show the connection among phenomena. They\nhave to satisfy the circumstances that obtain. A hypothesis is better\nin case it can accommodate more phenomena and notable circumstances.\nSimpler hypotheses should be preferred. Hence, Sturm avails himself of\nOckham’s razor in choosing among hypotheses. The reasoning\nbehind this is that simple hypotheses mirror God’s ways which\nare simple (PE I: preface, art. 3.1). God as the wisest creator of\nnature (Opificem naturae Sapientissimum) designed the world\nby simple means which have to be taken into consideration when\nstudying nature and its design. Furthermore, good hypotheses should\nneither conflict with phenomena, other established hypotheses nor\nevident principles (PE I: preface, art. 3.2). Finally, Sturm points\nout that hypotheses have to satisfy not only the intellect but also\nthe imagination and the senses (PE I: preface, art. 3.3).\nSturm’s reasoning here is that all natural phenomena are\nphenomena pertaining the world of extension and its modifications like\nshape and motion. The senses and the imagination are first and\nforemost concerned with the realm of extended beings, and therefore to\nassess the aptness of hypotheses about natural phenomena, one needs to\nconsult both of these faculties. Mere abstract conceptual reflection\nabout nature as is characteristic of the scholastics (Sturm thinks) is\nnot sufficient, since worldly phenomena are most proximate to and\npalpable by the senses and the imagination (PE I: preface, art\n3.3). \nIn this three-step method, the presentation of phenomena establishes\nthe explanandum, the hypotheses cover some ground towards\napproximating a solution. But since these different hypotheses either\ncontradict or run parallel to one another, a true explanation has to\nselect from existing theories what is true, reject what is false, and\nadd what needs be added. This brings us to Sturm’s\n eclecticism.[3] \nThe eclectic approach consists in nothing other than  \nto select and adopt (sibi sumere) from all sects of\nPhilosophers that which is true, having left behind what is false and\nerroneous. (PE I: preface, art. 2.1)  \nSturm encountered the eclectic method during his one-year stay in\nLeiden in 1660 probably inspired by Henricus Bornius. Both the preface\nof Sturm’s Physica Electiva and his disputation De\nPhilosophia Sectaria & Electiva (DSE; in his 1686\nPhilosophia Eclectica) held in 1679 are pleas for\neclecticism, which contrasts sharply with sectarian philosophy.\nAccording to Sturm, the whole of philosophers — bracketing\nsceptics and doubters (sceptios ac dubitatores) — can\nbe subsumed under two classes: sectarians and eclectics (DSE: 3). \nSectarian thinkers are led by an authority on whom they slavishly\ndepend. They do not follow their own reasoning, but spend their time\nabsorbing, reproducing and fiercely defending what they have learned\nex cathedra. Sectarian philosophers do not follow the truth\nof what is being said, but the authority of the person who said\nsomething. The most notable sects in Sturm’s days are the\nAristotelians (secta Aristotelica) with its two main\nbranches, namely, the Greek interpreters and the scholastic\ncommentators; the Cartesians (secta Cartesiana); the\nGassendists (secta Gassendica) reviving Epicurean and\nDemocritean thought; and the Neoplatonists (secta\nNeo-Platonica) (DSE: 13). In his Physica Electiva, Sturm\nmentions the alchemical school (the Spagyric school or that\nof the chemists [Chemicorum]) as the fourth main one omitting\nNeo-Platonism (PE I: preface, art. 3.5). \nThe case for eclecticism is made ex negativo by challenging\nsectarianism and positively by bringing to light the strengths of the\neclectic method. Concerning the repudiation of sectarian philosophy,\nSturm argues that adopting a sectarian approach is first of all not a\nnecessity (Sectariae quippe Philosophiae primo nulla est\nnecessitas). It is not the only option (see DSE: 28f). Second,\nfollowing one authority is not only not useful, it is even dangerous\nand damaging to the advancement and augmentation of the sciences. \nIn contrast to this, eclectic philosophers are defined as: \n[T]hose who did not want to hang on to every word of someone, nor\nswear by the words of one master; they knew and collected for their\nstorehouse everything that is true and good from the words and\nwritings of whatever teachers (Doctorum) not convinced by the\nauthority of the person teaching but by the weight of the arguments\nand demonstrations; even more they added from themselves as much as\nthey could; they make it their business (sustineant) to see\nwith their own rather than with someone else’s eyes. (DSE: 3f;\nsee also DSE: 6, 28) \nThe eclectic method acknowledges the feebleness of the human mind, its\nproclivity to err (DSE: 23). In this it is humbler than sectarian\nphilosophy which assumes to find all the truths in one author. Since\nhumans on their own tend to misjudge things or make mistakes, they\ndepend on one another as correctives. The scientific study of nature\nif it is to succeed, hence, becomes a collective endeavor: \nBy the name of the eclectic philosophers we understand in this whole\ntreatise no others than those, who do not reject without a difference\nall the things that are found (inventa) and left\n(tradita) by the heads of different sects, and who are not so\nmoved by the authority of one leader that they do accept all of his\nutterances and bons mots (dicteria), but who\nacknowledge the feebleness (imbecillitatem) of the human mind\n(humani ingenii), which makes it apparent that all depths of\nnature and reason cannot be exhausted by one or a few men; they\npersuade themselves that the truth can be only viewed in part, and\nthat the sciences are to be advanced and stabilized by means of united\npowers (junctis viribus) and communicated advice\n(communicato consilio). (DSE: 7f) \nIt should be stressed that although eclecticism means collecting what\nis good in other authors, it does not just aim at a mere collection of\ntrue or probable hypotheses, but instead at the formulation of a\ncoherent system of natural philosophy (PE I: preface, art. 3.2).\nEclecticism, in Sturm’s eyes, explicitly invites the correction,\nemendation and augmentation of existing theories (DSE: 48, 69). It is\na philosophical approach more useful and appropriate for the\nadvancement of the sciences than thinking in line with one author as\nthe sectarians do (DSE: 14). \nFinally, Sturm’s method conceives of natural philosophy as a\ndynamic project in a state of constant transformation. To illustrate\nthis point, Sturm compares philosophy as a whole to a ship: it is\nsomewhat complete, though undergoing constant changes and mending.\nBoth philosophy and a ship in use need to be fixed from time to time.\nOld, used-up parts (hypotheses in the case of philosophy, planks in\nthe case of the ship) have to go to be replaced by new parts fit to\nallow both to advance (CPMS: 79). Philosophy is a never ending\nproject. It can only approximate truth, getting closer and closer. No\nsingle natural philosopher has or could have exhausted and\nsufficiently explained the phenomena obtaining in nature. Hence, what\nneeds to be done is to diligently assess and select what is good and\ntrue in other philosophers, adding what needs to be added. New\nphenomena are being discovered, new competing hypotheses are being\ndeveloped to explain them. They too need to be assessed. What is\nreasonable remains. What is not able to stand up to the demands of a\ngood hypothesis will have to go. The experimental study of nature\nproceeds, too. New instruments are being developed raising new\nchallenges to old hypotheses. The vastness of nature, the manifold of\nits phenomena and the fact that causes cannot be observed but only\nconjectured add to the difficulty of the natural philosopher’s\ntask. It would indeed be temerity and arrogance to think that one has\nexplained all there needs to be explained in nature (CPMS: 67).\nTherefore, Sturm is making a case for the open-endedness of natural\nphilosophy. Its goal is to know oneself, to know the world, and\nultimately to know God (PE I: preface, art. 4.5; CPMS: 8). A goal that\nis not reachable within the life span of a human being, but a goal\nworth striving for. \nIn the theoretical part (physica generalis) of his\nPhysica Electiva, Sturm sets down the metaphysical foundations\nof his system. In a nutshell, Sturm argues that the whole of nature\n(human and angelic minds set aside) can be explained by two\nprinciples: matter and its modes, which are material forms. Both these\nprinciples are causally passive and shaped by local motion. Forms, in\nparticular, provide the specific reasons why certain phenomena are\nproduced in a certain way, but they do not include the causal powers\nthat bring these phenomena about. That power comes only from God, who\nis the universal and omnipresent cause acting in nature. In order to\nsupport this picture, Sturm gives a number of original twists to an\nargumentative strategy already exploited by other occasionalist\nauthors, while providing at the same time a more eclectic and broader\nrationale for endorsing an occasionalist metaphysics. To deepen\nSturm’s account, three main points deserve special attention:\n(1) the justification for passive forms as modes of matter;\n(2) why God’s causal power is directly needed to bring about\nnatural phenomena; and (3) the role that passive forms play in\nscientific explanations. \n(1) Early modern natural philosophers agree with their Scholastic\nopponents in granting that matter is utterly passive and devoid of\nefficacious causal powers. Sturm takes stock of this point, joining\nDescartes and other Cartesians in defining matter in terms of pure\nextension (res extensa) and motion as local motion. However,\nearly modern natural philosophers disagreed with Scholastics and among\nthemselves about the notion of ‘form’, whether there could\nbe any ‘substantial form’ and if rejecting substantial\nforms would lead to discard all causal powers in finite beings. \nSturm’s position in this debate is clear-cut. Sturm argues that\nforms are nothing but modes of matter (i.e., modifications of\nan extended substance), and since matter is causally passive, forms\nare causally passive, too. Sturm agrees with many other early modern\nanti-Scholastic philosophers in dismissing scholastic substantial\nforms. \nSturm’s argument for rejecting substantial forms is based on a\ntrilemma, according to which forms are either (i) purely material\nbeings, (ii) purely spiritual beings distinct from matter, or (iii) a\nkind of being that is in between purely material and purely immaterial\nsubstances. \nThe first option leads directly to Sturm’s own view. If\nsubstantial forms are purely material beings, they cannot be\nsubstances in themselves because the form of a material body cannot be\nanother separate material body, given that forms operate in virtue of\ntheir intimate union with the matter of the substance of which they\nare the form. It follows that if substantial forms are purely\nmaterial, then they have to be conceived as modes of matter. \nThe second option is relevant because later scholastic authors (such\nas Suárez) tended to use the rational soul as the prototype to\nunderstand natural substantial forms as well. However, the rational\nsoul is a self-standing spiritual substance that can exist and be\nconceived independently from the body with which it is united. This\nentails that the rational soul is not the form of the body,\nbut simply a different, independent substance that is united with the\nbody itself. Hence (pace scholastics), the case of the human\nrational soul cannot be used as a model to conceptualize\n‘substantial forms’ in other (non-human) natural beings\n(PE I: 94). \nSturm’s argument against the third option of the trilemma runs\nas follows. If one defines (as scholastics usually do) a substantial\nform in terms of the role that the form plays in explaining and\naccounting for the nature of composite beings, then what is called a\n‘substantial form’ cannot belong to the ontological\ncategory of a substance, but only to the category of\n‘relatives’ or relational things. Sturm stresses that\n“the entire nature of a form generally and essentially consists\nof a relation” (PE I: 94). Forms are not beings in themselves,\nbut ways in which certain beings operate and undergo changes.\nAgainst the third option of the trilemma, Sturm maintains that forms\nare not the kind of being that can be conceived of or exist\nindependently from the being that they inform. Natural forms\ncannot be understood as a kind of substance or being\nintermediate between material and spiritual substances because forms\nare not substances in the first place. Since natural forms\nare relational beings they cannot be substances, and\nthus the very idea of a ‘substantial form’ is a chimera, a\ncategory mistake. The only viable option left is thus the one defended\nby Sturm himself: forms are modes of matter, and since matter is\ncausally passive, forms are causally passive as well. \n(2) This conclusion requires an account of how natural phenomena can\ntake place if nothing in nature is endowed with active causal powers.\nAccording to Sturm, the origin of natural causality lies in God\nhimself. God is the substance defined by pure activity, and He is the\nonly truly efficient cause of all motion in the world: \nOnly God’s most efficacious volition is that truly acting power\n(virtutem), which moves while not being moved, which\nrigorously speaking moves, which moves one body by means of\n(per) another, which moves the whole corporeal world, its\nparts, some by means of (per) others, and in this way He\nbrings about (efficiat) every one of the natural effects that\nhappens in even the most remote corners of the Universe by means of\nhis sole immediate power. (PE I: 164) \nGod is the “requiring cause” (causam exigentem,\nPE I: 161) of natural phenomena. This means that when God\nwants something to happen then the effect obtains. However,\nSturm also maintains that God’s will does not operate in nature\nthrough its “absolute power” (potentia absoluta)\nbut rather by following what Sturm calls “respective or\nhypothetical power” (potentia respectiva &\nhypothetica): \nHere I established that God acts and operates in the whole of nature,\nnot on the basis of his absolute power (which obtains whatever he\nwants without hindrances and in the most perfect way), but on the\nbasis of a respective and hypothetical power, whose exercise God\nhimself has (in the most free way) subordinated to certain conditions\nof matter or of the human mind. (PE I: 178) \nGod did not establish to elicit effects absolutely by his mere act of\nfree will. Rather, God freely subordinated his own actions to the\nobtainment of certain specific conditions, namely, certain states of\nnatural beings or of human minds. Sturm does not extensively use the\nMalebranchian terminology of occasional causes, but he does explicitly\nequate occasional causes with sine quibus non causes (PE I:\n117). A sine qua non cause is a (counterfactually) necessary\ncondition for the production of a certain effect, although the\nsine qua non cause does not truly contribute to its\nproduction in virtue of any active power it possesses (see Sangiacomo\n2019). Sturm’s account of God’s hypothetical power entails\nthat all natural forms are sine quibus non conditions for the\nproduction of natural effects, in the sense that they do not\ncontribute in virtue of any active power they might have (since they\nhave none), but rather because God (freely) established to bring about\ncertain effects as consequences of certain modifications (i.e., forms)\nof matter. Since (what Malebranche calls) ‘occasional\ncauses’ can be understood in terms of sine qua non\ncausation, and since Sturm maintains that all natural forms work as\nsine quibus non causes of natural effects, it seems safe to\nconclude that Sturm supports a version of occasionalism. \nHence, Sturm’s strategy achieves its goal: matter is causally\npassive, and material forms are passive as well. In order to account\nfor the changes observed in nature, it is necessary to locate a source\nfor causal activity. However, this source cannot be found anywhere in\nthe natural world itself. God is thus the only candidate left to\naccount for the causal active power needed to bring about natural\nphenomena. God’s power, however, is only responsible for the\nfact that natural phenomena are brought about. The specific\nreason why they are such and such is to be located in the\nspecific features of passive forms themselves. In this respect,\nGod’s involvement in nature plays only a metaphysical grounding\nfunction and it is not supposed to replace, but rather to justify, the\nneed to carefully investigate the mechanical structures of passive\nforms. \nSturm’s occasionalism, however, is quite peculiar, especially as\ncompared to Malebranche’s more familiar version of\noccasionalism. A crucial feature of Malebranche’s occasionalism\nis the role that the laws of nature play in accounting for natural\nphenomena. According to him, natural beings do not have any causal\npowers and can be occasions of their effects only in virtue of the\nlaws of nature established by God. In contrast, Sturm takes God to\nestablish the whole set of counterfactually necessary conditionals\nthat determine which effects will obtain when certain conditions are\nin place in nature. These conditions are passive forms themselves,\nwhich then play the role of explanantia of natural\nphenomena. \n(3) Sturm’s account of passive forms breaks with the idea that\nexplanatory principles in natural philosophy must also account for the\nactive power that brings phenomena about. In this sense, Sturm\ndismisses the idea that causal explanations must be based on active\npowers intrinsic to the natural agents themselves. According to Sturm,\nall phenomena are brought about by God himself. But God’s power\nbeing indifferent, differences among phenomena depend on passive\nforms, which operate as sine quibus non conditions for their\nproduction. This means that the explanandum in natural\nphenomena is not the fact that something is brought about, but rather\nthe specific characteristics of what is brought about. God’s\npower explains that something (in general) is brought about, but only\npassive forms explain what is brought about in particular and how. The\nexplanandum in natural phenomena is thus the specificity of\nthe phenomenon at stake, and the explanans of this phenomenon\nare passive forms, which are a matter of empirical investigation. \nSturm’s approach combines the strengths of both the scholastic\nand seventeenth-century mechanist approach in order to remedy their\nreciprocal shortcomings. Passive mechanical forms (as\nAristotelian-scholastic forms) are particular principles of\nexplanation that can be used to account for different specific\nphenomena. At the same time, passive mechanical forms (as mechanical\nprinciples) are ontologically nothing but modes of matter shaped by\nmotion. Passive forms are different among themselves but they\nare all ontologically shaped by the same universal principles, which\nmake explanations based on passive mechanical forms homogenous and\nuniform (from a conceptual point of view) without making them too\ngeneral and abstract. \nSturm’s approach has at least two important implications: (i)\nthe integration of teleology and final causation in a mechanist\nnatural philosophy; and (ii) the marginalization of the laws of nature\ntherein. \nSturm is a strenuous defender of natural teleology and final causes.\nIn the chapter dedicated to final causes in the PE, Sturm presents to\nthe reader numerous phenomena which are supposed to back up or at\nleast make her inclined to accept the existence of teleology in nature\nas well as the necessity to study it. Sturm mentions inter\nalia bodily organs performing certain functions (the eyes are\nthere to see; the heart pumps blood through the body) and the\nwell-adaptedness of certain animals; for instance, in the case of\nbirds (geese, ducks, storks) their wings, the lightness of their\nbones, and the possession of a certain type of beak. According to\nSturm, ends and uses are an inextricable part of the world as a whole\nand of its parts (PE I: 226). Sturm’s passive forms thus retain\nthe teleological connotation that Aristotelian forms already had,\nfitting it into a mechanist picture of the universe. Forms are\nstructures of matter aimed at producing certain effects rather than\nothers. They are not only the efficient (passive) conditions for these\neffects to obtain, but also the final (passive) principles that\nexplain them. Properly speaking, God himself, once again, is the sole\nfinal cause in nature, since God is the one who designed,\nplanned and carried out the whole of nature as a gigantic and most\nperfect clockwork. \nSturm’s emphasis on forms has its counterpart in his\nmarginalization of the role that the laws of nature play in his\nnatural philosophy and in scientific explanations. Sturm puts forward\nonly two very general laws, one concerning the communication of motion\n(PE I: 164) and the other concerning the mind-body union (PE I:\n858–859). Focusing on the conservation of motion, it is\nimportant to stress that this law is not supposed to explain what\nspecific features different specific bodies can have, nor does Sturm\never suggest that the variety of finite things could follow from a\nconsideration of this (or any other) law alone. Rather, the law of the\nconservation of the quantity of motion simply constrains the effects\nof every natural phenomenon (namely, the fact that motion cannot be\ndissipated during impacts but must be always conserved in the whole of\nthe universe). Remarkably, Sturm also mentions that this law is not\ndeduced a priori from purely metaphysical considerations (as\nis the case in Descartes’ deduction of conservation from the\nnature of God’s immutability), but rather only a\nposteriori on the basis of empirical observations. As an\nempirical regularity derived from experience, Sturm’s\nconservation law does not have the same strong metaphysical\nconnotations of Malebranche’s laws of nature (which are grounded\nin a consideration of God’s attributes of simplicity and\nwisdom), nor does it play any significant role in the explanation of\nparticular phenomena.","contact.mail":"c.k.r.henkel@rug.nl","contact.domain":"rug.nl"}]
