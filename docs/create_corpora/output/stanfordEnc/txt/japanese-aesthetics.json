A good way to survey the broader field is to\nexamine the most important aesthetic ideas that have arisen in the\ncourse of the tradition, all of them before aesthetics was formally\nestablished as a discipline: namely, mono no aware (the\npathos of things), wabi (subdued, austere beauty),\nsabi (rustic patina), yūgen (mysterious\nprofundity), iki (refined style), and kire\n(cutting). (This last term is pronounced as two evenly accented\nsyllables, kee-reh. The macrons over some vowels signify a\nvowel sound of double length. When a person name is used, the order is\nthe conventional Japanese one: family name, then given name.)\n\n\n\nTwo preliminary observations about the Japanese cultural tradition are\nrelevant to the arts. First, classical Japanese philosophy understands\nreality as constant change, or (to use a Buddhist expression)\nimpermanence. The world of flux that presents itself to our\nsenses is the only reality: there is no conception of some stable\n“Platonic” realm above or behind it. The arts in Japan\nhave traditionally reflected this fundamental\nimpermanence—sometimes lamenting but more often celebrating\nit. The idea of mujō (impermanence) is perhaps most\nforcefully expressed in the writings and sayings of the\nthirteenth-century Zen master Dōgen, who is arguably Japan’s\nprofoundest philosopher, but there is a fine expression of it by a\nlater Buddhist priest, Yoshida Kenkō, whose Essays in\nIdleness (Tsurezuregusa, 1332) sparkles with aesthetic\ninsights: \n\nIn the Japanese Buddhist tradition, awareness of the fundamental\ncondition of existence is no cause for nihilistic despair, but rather\na call to vital activity in the present moment and to gratitude for\nanother moment’s being granted to us. \n\nThe second observation is that the arts in Japan have tended to be\nclosely connected with Confucian practices of self-cultivation, as\nevidenced in the fact that they are often referred to as “ways\n[of living]”: chadō, the way of tea (tea\nceremony), shōdō, the way of writing (calligraphy),\nand so forth. And since the scholar official in China was expected to\nbe skilled in the “Six Arts”—ceremonial ritual,\nmusic, calligraphy, mathematics, archery, and\ncharioteering—culture and the arts tend to be more closely\nconnected with intellect and the life of the mind than in the western\ntraditions. \n\nTo this day it is not unusual in Japan for the scholar to be a fine\ncalligrapher and an accomplished poet in addition to possessing the\npertinent intellectual abilities. \n\nThe meaning of the phrase mono no aware is complex and has\nchanged over time, but it basically refers to a “pathos”\n(aware) of “things” (mono), deriving\nfrom their transience. In the classic anthology of Japanese poetry\nfrom the eighth century, Manyōshū, the\nfeeling of aware is typically triggered by the plaintive\ncalls of birds or other animals. It also plays a major role in the\nworld’s first novel, Murasaki Shikibu’s Genji monogatari (The\nTale of Genji), from the early eleventh century. The somewhat later\nHeike monogatari (The Tale of the Heike Clan) begins with\nthese famous lines, which clearly show impermanence as the basis for\nthe feeling of mono no aware: And here is Kenkō on the link between impermanence and beauty:\n“If man were never to fade away like the dews of Adashino, never\nto vanish like the smoke over Toribeyama, how things would lose their\npower to move us! The most precious thing in life is its\nuncertainty” (Keene, 7). The acceptance and celebration of\nimpermanence goes beyond all morbidity, and enables full enjoyment of\nlife: Insofar as we don’t rejoice in life we fail to appreciate the\npathos of the things with which we share our lives. For most of us,\nsome of these things, impermanent as they are, will outlast\nus—and especially if they have been loved they will become sad\nthings: “It is sad to think that a man’s familiar possessions,\nindifferent to his death, should remain long after he is gone”\n(Keene, 30). \n\nThe well known literary theorist Motoori Norinaga brought the idea\nof mono no aware to the forefront of literary theory with a\nstudy of The Tale of Genji that showed this phenomenon to be\nits central theme.  He argues for a broader understanding of it as\nconcerning a profound sensitivity to the emotional and affective\ndimensions of existence in general. The greatness of Lady Murasaki’s\nachievement consists in her ability to portray characters with a\nprofound sense of mono no aware in her writing, such that the\nreader is able to empathize with them in this feeling. \n\nThe films of Ozu Yasujirō, who is often thought to be the most\n“Japanese” of Japanese film directors, are a series of\nexercises in conveying mono no aware. Stanley Cavell’s\nobservation that “film returns to us and extends our first\nfascination with objects, with their inner and fixed lives”\napplies consummately to Ozu, who often expresses feelings through\npresenting the faces of things rather than of actors. A vase standing\nin the corner of a tatami-matted room where a father and daughter are\nasleep; two fathers contemplating the rocks in a “dry\nlandscape” garden, their postures echoing the shapes of the\nstone; a mirror reflecting the absence of the daughter who has just\nleft home after getting married—all images that express the\npathos of things as powerfully as the expression on the greatest\nactor’s face. \n\nThe most frequently cited example of mono no aware in\ncontemporary Japan is the traditional love of cherry blossoms, as\nmanifested by the huge crowds of people that go out every year to view\n(and picnic under) the cherry trees. The blossoms of the Japanese\ncherry trees are intrinsically no more beautiful than those of, say,\nthe pear or the apple tree: they are more highly valued because of\ntheir transience, since they usually begin to fall within a week of\ntheir first appearing. It is precisely the evanescence of their beauty\nthat evokes the wistful feeling of mono no aware in the\nviewer. \n\nIn aforementioned Essays in Idleness Kenkō asks, “Are we to\nlook at cherry blossoms only in full bloom, at the moon only when it\nis cloudless?” (Keene, 115). If for the Buddhists the basic\ncondition is impermanence, to privilege as consummate only certain\nmoments in the eternal flux may signify a refusal to accept that basic\ncondition. Kenkō continues: “To long for the moon while\nlooking on the rain, to lower the blinds and be unaware of the passing\nof the spring—these are even more deeply moving. Branches about\nto blossom or gardens strewn with faded flowers are worthier of our\nadmiration.” This is an example of the idea of wabi,\nunderstated beauty, which was first distinguished and praised when\nexpressed in poetry. But it is in the art of tea, and the context of\nZen, that the notion of wabi is most fully developed. \n\nIn the Nampōroku (1690), a record of sayings by the tea\nmaster Sen no Rikyū, we read: “In the small [tea] room, it\nis desirable for every utensil to be less than adequate. There are\nthose who dislike a piece when it is even slightly damaged; such an\nattitude shows a complete lack of comprehension” (Hirota,\n226). Implements with minor imperfections are often valued more\nhighly, on the wabi aesthetic, than ones that are ostensibly\nperfect; and broken or cracked utensils, as long as they have been\nwell repaired, more highly than the intact. The wabi\naesthetic does not imply asceticism but rather moderation, as this\npassage from the Nampōroku demonstrates: “The meal\nfor a gathering in a small room should be but a single soup and two or\nthree dishes; sakè should also be served in\nmoderation. Elaborate preparation of food for the wabi\ngathering is inappropriate” (Hirota, 227). \n\nThe Zencharoku (Zen Tea Record, 1828) contains a well known\nsection on the topic of wabi, which begins by saying that it\nis simply a matter of “upholding the [Buddhist] precepts”\n(Hirota, 274). The author continues: The way of tea exemplifies\nthis attitude toward life in the elegant simplicity of the tea house\nand the utensils, which contradicts any notion that beauty must entail\nmagnificence and opulence. Wabi reaches its peak of austerity in\nemptiness—which is a central and pervasive idea in Buddhism. In\nan essay “In Praise of Shadows” (1933) the great novelist\nTanizaki Jun’ichirō (1886–1965) has this to say about the beauty\nof the alcove (tokonoma) in the traditional Japanese\nteahouse: A simple structure, but a special and evocative one, a place of\ndeeply philosophical depths. A space cut out of the room, which cuts\noff direct light and thereby opens up a new world: these techniques\ndeveloped distinctively in the Japanese tradition of\narchitecture. (See section 7, below, on cutting.) Instead of adding something artistic to the wall one subtracts the\nwall itself and sets it back into an alcove. Then let the emptiness\nthat’s opened up fill with a play of light and shades. \n\nOne place with a claim to be where the Japanese tea ceremony\noriginated is Ginkakuji, The Temple of the Silver Pavilion, in\nKyoto. Whereas the pavilion (late 15th century) is a modest monument\nto the joys of sabi, the Moon-Viewing Platform and Sea of\nSilver Sand beside it (from some 200 years later) are paradigms\nof Wabi. These latter two constitute an unusual version of\nthe distinctively Japanese “dry landscape” style of garden\n(see section 7, below). These strikingly abstract formations (for the\n17th century!) are optimally viewed from the second floor of the\npavilion on a night of the full moon, when the sand glistens silver in\nthe moonlight and the stripes appear as waves on the surface of a\nmotionless ocean. \n Larger Photographs of the Sea of Silver Sand and Moon-Viewing Platform at Ginkakuji \n\nThe term sabi occurs often in the\nManyōshū, where it has a connotation of\ndesolateness (sabireru means “to become\ndesolate”), and later on it seems to acquire the meaning of\nsomething that has aged well, grown rusty (another word pronounced\nsabi means “rust”), or has acquired a patina that\nmakes it beautiful. \n\nThe importance of sabi for the way of tea was affirmed by the\ngreat fifteenth-century tea master Shukō, founder of one of the\nfirst schools of tea ceremony. As a distinguished commentator puts it:\n“The concept sabi carries not only the meaning\n‘aged’—in the sense of ‘ripe with experience\nand insight’ as well as ‘infused with the patina that\nlends old things their beauty’—but also that of\ntranquility, aloneness, deep solitude” (Hammitzsch, 46). \n\nThe feeling of sabi is also evoked in the haiku of the famous\nseventeenth-century poet Matsuo Bashō, where its connection with\nthe word sabishi (solitary, lonely) is emphasized. The\nfollowing haiku typifies sabi(shi) in conveying an atmosphere\nof solitude or loneliness that undercuts, as Japanese poetry usually\ndoes, the distinction between subjective and objective: \n\nContrasting with the colorful beauty of the blossoms, the more subdued\ngracefulness of the cypress—no doubt older than the person\nseeing it but no less solitary—typifies the poetic mood of\nsabi. \n\nTanizaki’s “In Praise of Shadows” frequently\ncelebrates sabi. By contrast with Western taste, he writes of\nthe Japanese sensibility:  This is a significant existential consideration: the sheen of older\nthings connects us with the past in ways that shiny products of modern\ntechnology simply cannot. And since older things tend to be made from\nnatural materials, to deal with them helps us to realize our closest\nconnections with the natural environment. Sabi figures prominently, for Tanizaki, in the aesthetics of\nthe traditional Japanese toilet, which “stands apart from the\nmain building at the end of a corridor, in a grove fragrant with\nleaves and moss.” He wrestles with the vexations that modern\ntechnology imposes on the question of fixtures, as the traditional\nones are superseded by “white porcelain and handles of sparkling\nmetal” (Tanizaki, 3, 6). It is surely fitting that one should perform those most natural\nfunctions of urinating and defecating, returning to the earth the\nwaste from its bounties, in natural rather than high-tech\nsurroundings. A more exalted exemplification of sabi is the exquisite\nSilver Pavilion at Ginkakuji in Kyoto. Even though the tea ceremony is\nsaid to have originated here, in a small sabi-saturated\nteahouse, the exterior of the pavilion was originally going to be\ncovered in silver foil, in emulation of the Golden Pavilion (14th\ncentury) at Kinkakuji. Without ever having enjoyed a coating of\nsilver, the Silver Pavilion is the epitome of sabi and one of\nthe most graceful structures ever built. The contrast with the larger,\nand flashier Golden Pavilion, whose coating of gold leaf lends it a\nquite different (and distinctly un-sabi) kind of beauty, is\ninstructive. \n Larger Photographs of the Silver Pavilion at Ginkakuji and the Golden Pavilion at Kinkakuji In 1950 a deranged Buddhist acolyte, deeply disturbed by the beauty\nof the Golden Pavilion, set fire to it and burned it to the ground.\nAn exact replica was built on the original site in 1955. The aesthetic\nqualities of the original structure are celebrated in Mishima Yukio’s\nfine novel The Temple of the Golden Pavilion (1956), as well\nas in Ichikawa Kon’s classic film Enjo (Conflagration,\n1958). In 1987, the burgeoning Japanese economy made it possible for\nthe first time in the building’s history to cover the structure with\ngold leaf, according to the creator’s original intention. The result\nis breathtakingly spectacular—but totally un-Japanese. Old-time\nresidents of Kyoto famously complained that it would take a long time\nfor the building to acquire sufficient\nsabi to be worth looking at again. At the rate the patina\nseems to be progressing, probably several centuries. \nIn 2011, after the tsunami in Tōhoku and the explosions and\nnuclear meltdown in Fukushima caused an acute energy shortage in\nJapan, one of many responses was a dramatic reduction of lighting in\npublic places, and especially in subway stations with extensive\nunderground restaurant and shopping precincts. Tanizaki cites a\nprescient remark from the late 1920s to the effect that “perhaps\nno two countries waste more electricity than America and Japan”\n(Tanizaki, 35). He would be delighted now to see Japanese cities\nreducing the ubiquitous glare of neon lighting and all-night electric\nillumination, in a dimming of unnecessary lights which thereby\nreintroduces some of the shadows he so eloquently praises. \n\nYūgen may be, among generally recondite Japanese\naesthetic ideas, the most ineffable. The term is first found in\nChinese philosophical texts, where it has the meaning of\n“dark,” or “mysterious.” \n\nKamo no Chōmei, the author of the well-known\nHōjōki (An Account of my Hut, 1212), also wrote\nabout poetry and considered yūgen to be a primary\nconcern of the poetry of his time. He offers the following as a\ncharacerization of yūgen: “It is like an autumn\nevening under a colorless expanse of silent sky. Somehow, as if for\nsome reason that we should be able to recall, tears well\nuncontrollably.” Another characterization helpfully mentions the\nimportance of the imagination: “When looking at autumn mountains\nthrough mist, the view may be indistinct yet have great\ndepth. Although few autumn leaves may be visible through the mist, the\nview is alluring. The limitless vista created in imagination far\nsurpasses anything one can see more clearly” (Hume,\n253–54). \n\nThis passage instantiates a general feature of East-Asian culture,\nwhich favors allusiveness over explicitness and completeness.\nYūgen does not, as has sometimes been supposed, have to\ndo with some other world beyond this one, but rather with the depth of\nthe world we live in, as experienced with the aid of a cultivated\nimagination. \n\nThe art in which the notion of yūgen has played the most\nimportant role is the Nō drama, one of the world’s great theater\ntraditions, which attained its highest flourishing through the\nartistry of Zeami Motokiyo (1363–1443). Zeami wrote a number of\ntreatises on Nō drama, in which yūgen\n(“Grace”) figures as “the highest principle”\n(Rimer, 92). He associates it with the highly refined culture of the\nJapanese nobility, and with their speech in particular, though there\nis also in Nō a “Grace of music,” a “Grace of\nperformance [of different roles],” and a “Grace of the\ndance” (Rimer, 93). It is something rare, that is attained only\nby the greatest actors in the tradition, and only after decades of\ndedicated practice of the art. It is impossible to conceptualize, so\nthat Zeami often resorts to imagery in trying to explain it:\n“Cannot the beauty of Grace be compared to the image of a swan\nholding a flower in its bill, I wonder?” (Rimer, 73). \n\nThe most famous formulation comes at the beginning of Zeami’s\n“Notes on the Nine Levels [of artistic attainment in\nNō],” where the highest level is referred to as “the\nart of the flower[ing] of peerless charm”: This passage alludes to the results of a pattern of rigorous\ndiscipline that informs many “performing arts” (which\nwould include the tea ceremony and calligraphy as well as theater) in\nJapan, as well as East-Asian martial arts.  Nō is exemplary in\nthis respect, since its forms of diction, gestures, gaits, and dance\nmovements are all highly stylized and extremely unnatural. The idea is\nthat one practices for years a “form” (kata) that\ngoes counter to the movements of the body and thus requires\ntremendous discipline—to the point of a breakthrough to a\n“higher naturalness” that is exhibited when the form has\nbeen consummately incorporated. This kind of spontaneity gives the\nimpression, as in the case of Grace, of something\n“supernatural.” \n\nIntriguing features of Japanese aesthetics are revealed through the\nartistic practices of Sesshū Tōyō and his most\ncelebrated work, the so-called “Splashed ink landscape” of\n1495 (Haboku Sansui, literally, “Broken Ink\nLandscape”). Taking the first steps towards reading his art\ncalls on us to recognize a distinctive feature of Japanese landscape\npaintings, that is, as art objects they have a considerably expanded\naesthetic status relative to similar works as interpreted within\nWestern philosophical and art historical traditions.  Of course, the\npainting object itself is important, but key aesthetic value also lies\nin the bodily performance the work attests to. Properly estimating the\nbeauty of Sesshū’s “Splashed ink\nlandscape”—similar to how one should appreciate Japanese\ncalligraphy—involves more than simply making judgments regarding\nthe marks on paper, but also calls for an appreciation of the bodily\nmovements that created the work. Because Sesshū’s\nspontaneous movements were cultivated according to highly disciplined\nZen Buddhist practices, interpreting his landscape art demands an\naesthetics expanded to embrace the philosophic and religious. \n\nSesshū Tōyō (雪舟等楊,\n1420–1506) was a towering figure of the Japanese art world who helped\ninitiate an indigenous artistic tradition at a time when\nphilosophic-religious practices were going beyond their Chinese\ninfluence, as Chan Buddhism gave rise to Zen Buddhism in\nJapan. Sesshū was part of a trajectory of many centuries to\nestablish Japanese forms of Buddhism as an enduring feature of the\ncountry’s religious, philosophic, and aesthetic identity. During\nhis life, Zen was reaching prominence as a religious discipline, as\nwere the related arts under Ashikaga patronage. The Muromachi Period\nwas the time of Zen aesthetics: not only monochrome ink painting, but\nall Japanese aesthetic practices (geidō) including\ncalligraphy, tea ceremony, Nō drama, and dry landscape gardening\nflourished as expressions of the Zen, especially Rinzai Zen, spirit of\nthe time. During this period, a shift was underway in the painting\nworld from kara-e (唐絵 “Chinese\npainting”) to yamato-e\n(大和絵 “Japanese\npainting”). Representations of deities for devotional purposes,\nand paintings of Daoist and Buddhist themes (dōshakuga)\nwere being supplanted as the heart of art practice as Japan saw its\nfirst movements towards initiating an art tradition seeking purely\naesthetic ideals. Landscape painting was central to that movement. \n\nSesshū was a celebrated painter, poet, calligrapher, and\ngardener, who mastered all of the major Chinese styles and genres, from\nbird and flower paintings, to portraiture, hanging scrolls, screens,\nand fans. It was his landscapes, however, particularly his famed\n“Splashed Ink Landscape” for which he has been\nimmortalized. This painting offers insight into a central concept of\nJapanese aesthetics discussed above, that is, yūgen.  \n Splashed Ink Landscape by Sesshū \n\nThe mysterious grace of his most celebrated landscape painting derives\nas much from the space that is left un-touched, the invisible and\nabsent (often referred to as the “dragon’s veins” of\na painting) as from what is painted and visible. The work appears\nincomplete, still in the act of formation, and the dramatic negative\nspaces created by the mists allow the various forms to dissolve and\nblend into one another, but more decisively, according to the\nyūgen dynamic, this negativity invites the viewer into the\npainting to actively complete it. As artists employing yūgen\nprinciples in other genres have shown, the incompleteness and\nallusiveness of the artwork summons the viewer into the scene. In\nGhilardi’s words, “the onlooker must merge in the image,\ncompleting the empty spaces, making it a lively element of nature\nitself, ‘between’ visible and invisible” (Ghilardi,\n2015, 99). \n\nSesshū does not seek to render every detail of the landscape to\nachieve representational verisimilitude, to depict an object that would\nbe discernible for a subject. The aim is to give only a suggestion or a\ntrace of trees, mountains, or waters, which appear to negate themselves\nas objects. Accordingly, Sesshū does not circumscribe forms but\noffers the impression of poetic immediacy by breaking them down.\nExtreme abbreviation and abstraction are employed such that any form,\nif even discernible, is pushed as far as possible from objectivity\nwithout disappearing completely into formlessness. As Jullien writes\nregarding Chinese painters who influenced Sesshū, they paint the\n“landscape in the tonality of as if, in the mode of\nappearing-disappearing, at once ‘as if there were’ and\n‘as if there were not.’”(Jullien, 2009. 8) The\ncentral grouping of trees, the inn blending into their trunks, and the\ntiny oarsman all appear but feel as though they are about to be lost,\nmaybe already transitioning into a vague memory, only a brushstroke\naway from dissolving completely. A sensitive viewer does not simply\nperceive a representation of this event, but can sense the sweeping and\nspontaneous gestures that gave rise to the ephemerality of the scene.\nTo appreciate this aesthetic feature of the painting invokes Buddhist\nprinciples Sesshū would have cultivated as a Zen monk. \n\nSesshū’s life and work are exemplary for Japanese\naesthetics given that his practice was not aesthetic in a restricted\nsense, but also encompassed the religious and philosophical principles\nof Daoist-inspired Zen Buddhism. “Splashed ink landscape”\nwas composed in Sesshū’s 76th year, a time when\nhe claimed that his eyes “were growing misty” and Daoism\nwas increasingly influential for his painting. As a painter-priest,\nboth his meditative as well as his artistic practice would have aimed\nat self-negation, at achieving “non-self” as per the goal\nof Zen training. As Yukio Lippit writes, “Splashed Ink Landscape\nthus showcases a mode of ink painting that projects both cultivated\nartistic agency and a state of subjectlessness. This condition of the\npermeable subject would prove pitch-perfect for the Japanese monk\npainter of the late medieval period” (Lippit 2012, 71). To\ndisclose how this aesthetic-religious goal was approached in painting\npractice reveals the Daoist roots of Zen Buddhism.  \n\nPainting was among the Japanese aesthetic practices referred to as\ngeidō 芸道. One of the sinographs shared among the compounds\nfor archery (kyudō 弓道), martial arts\n(jūdō 柔道), calligraphy (shodō\n書道), flower arranging (kadō\n 華道), tea ceremony (sadō\n茶道) is the sinograph dao \n(道), (dō or michi in Japanese) indicating the\nphilosophic-religious orientation of the practices. To move according\nto the dao is to move with a natural spontaneity as an embodiment of\nthe well-known concept “non-action” (wuwei\n無爲). Acting spontaneously involves moving beyond the\nbinary of activity or passivity; that is, the world moves the body as\nmuch as the body moves in the world. Accordingly, as Nishida comments,\nwe can say that “Sesshū painted nature or that nature\npainted itself through Sesshū” (Nishida 1990, 135). The\ngraceful naturalness of the swordsman, the calligrapher, or the Nō\nactor is also characteristic of the painter’s gestures. All are\nbodily practices that seek to harmonize with the spontaneous motions of\nthe dao through non-action. Thus, to estimate the aesthetic value of\nSesshū’s brushwork is to appreciate its religious source in\nDaoist-informed Buddhist practice. Because observers can harmonize\ntheir own bodies with the movements animating the painting, the work\nelicits more than aesthetic judgments, it is itself a site for\ncultivating religious-philosophic discipline. \n\nThe “splashed ink” technique Sesshū employed is\nparticularly exemplary of the expanded frame of Japanese aesthetics.\n“Splashed Ink” (hatsuboku) was one of several\n“broken ink” (haboku) spontaneous techniques\noriginating in China, which Sesshū learned while travelling to\nstudy with painters and conduct religious practice at its\nmonasteries. The techniques ranged from spontaneous washes and\nsplashes to actual ink-flinging and dripping. While these methods\nsound reckless and were associated with an “aesthetics of\ninebriation” and “aesthetics of accident,” the\nsplashed ink idiom is in fact the most demanding style, regarded as\nthe highest form of expression and the supreme test of the\nartist’s skill. Likewise, it was thought to test the\nobserver’s sensitivity like no other genre.  The style\noriginated with the “literati” artists of the Southern\nSong School of Chinese landscape painting who favored\nyūgen-style abbreviated poetic suggestion, rather than\nthe detailed and descriptive “academic” approach of the\nNorthern School. Thus, following this tradition, painters such as\nSesshū did not aim to develop virtuoso skill to create a fully\nformed art image, but in negating the self and becoming continuous\nwith the motions of nature, they follow the Daoist precept that\n“the great image has no form”. \n\nThe Structure of “Iki” (“Iki” no\nkōzō) by Kuki Shūzō (1888–1941) is arguably\nthe most significant work in Japanese aesthetics from the twentieth\ncentury—and certainly one of the shortest. Kuki wrote the first\ndraft in 1926 while living in Paris, toward the end of a seven-year\nstay in Europe, and published the book shortly after returning to\nJapan in 1929. It’s a phenomenological and hermeneutic study of a\nphenomenon, iki, that was central to Japanese aesthetic life\nduring the previous two or three hundred years and derived from forms\nof erotic relations between men and geisha in the pleasure quarters of\nthe big cities. Kuki remarks that although the French\nterms chic, coquet, and raffiné\nshare connotations with the term iki, no European word is\ncapable of translating the richness of its\nmeanings—unsurprisingly, since it emerged from a particular\ncultural context and Kuki is concerned to grasp the “living\nform” of the phenomenon as experienced. Kuki mentions the\nFrench esprit and the German Sehnsucht as terms that\nare similarly untranslatable, for similar reasons of cultural\nembeddedness (Nara, 15–16). \n\nKuki distinguishes two further “moments” of iki\nin addition to its basis in seductiveness or coquetry\n(bitai): “brave composure” (ikiji) and\n“resignation” (akirame). Insofar as iki\nas seductiveness is concerned “to maintain a dualistic\nrelationship, protecting the possibility as\npossibility”—an allusion to Heidegger’s existential\nconception of death as ultimate possibility—it already embraces\nimpermanence and mortality. This protection of possibility is thus\nenhanced by brave composure, which for Kuki is exemplified in the\nattitude toward death (his own and others’) on the part of the samurai\nwarrior and his way of living (bushidō). It is enhanced\ntoo by the moment of resignation, which Kuki understands as the\nBuddhist attitude of non-attachment to a world of impermanence. All\ntogether they enable a kind of aesthetic “play”, thanks to\na (phenomenological) “bracketing” of the concerns of\neveryday life (Nara, 18–23). \n\nAfter positioning the phenomenon of iki among a variety of\nother aesthetic feelings such as sweet (amami) versus\nastringent (shibumi), flashy (hade) versus quiet\n(jimi), and crude (gehin) versus refined\n(jōhin), Kuki goes on to examine the objective\nexpressions of the phenomenon, which are either “natural”\nor “artistic” (Nara, 24–34). In nature, willow trees\nand slow, steady rain exemplify iki; in the human body a\nslight relaxation, a voice of medium rather than high pitch, a face\nthat is long rather than round, a certain tension and relaxation\ntogether of the eyes, mouth, and cheeks, the hand curved or slightly\nbent back. Also iki is the wearing of thin fabric, makeup\nthinly applied, hair styled not too formally, with the aid of water\nrather than oil, and a décolletage designed to call\nattention to the nape of the neck laid bare (Nara, 35–39). \n\nIn the “free art” of design, parallel lines, and\nespecially vertical stripes, are expressive of iki: almost\nall the other beautiful patterns developed by Japanese fabric arts,\nsince they often involve curved lines, are un-iki. The only\ncolors that embody iki are certain grays, browns, and\nblues. In architecture the small (four-and-a-half mat) Zen teahouse is\na paradigm of iki, especially insofar as it initiates an\ninterplay between wood and bamboo. Lighting must be subdued: indirect\ndaylight or else the kind of illumination provided by a paper\nlantern. The scales, melodies, and rhythms of various kinds of music\nare correspondingly iki, insofar as (alluding to Goethe,\nSchelling, and Schopenhauer)“Architecture is frozen music, and\nmusic as flowing architecture” (Nara, 41–51). \n\nIn his conclusion, Kuki asks whether various nineteenth-century and\ncontemporary European arts might exemplify iki and decides\nprobably not exactly, though he allows that various aspects of\nBaudelaire’s poetry and aesthetics come very close (with the\ndifference that dandyism is a male prerogative whereas iki is\nassociated with both sexes). During his seven years in Germany and\nFrance he listened to lectures and seminars by, and conversed\nwith, such figures as Heinrich Rickert, Edmund Husserl, Martin\nHeidegger, Henri Bergson, and Jean-Paul Sartre. Kuki thereby developed a\nsophisticated understanding of European philosophy and aesthetics, and\nwas concerned after his return to Japan to apply methods he had\nlearned to a Japanese aesthetic phenomenon. He didn’t therefore\naspire to any kind of universal aesthetics—since iki is\nrooted in the culture of a particular ethnic group. Yet because the\nJapanese at that time, under geopolitical pressure to modernise more\nefficiently, were losing touch with their own traditions, Kuki took it\nas one of his tasks to celebrate the aesthetic values of the past\n(Nara, 58–60).   \n\nHe has unfortunately been excoriated on these grounds as an\nultranationalist and even a fascist, notably by Leslie Pincus in her\nbook Authenticating Culture in Imperial Japan: Kuki\nShūzō and the Rise of National Aesthetics, and this\ndeters some people from reading him. But while Pincus’s book provides\na good deal of helpful historical background of the milieu in which\nKuki was working in Japan, her claims that he was a fascist are\ngroundless (see Parkes 1997, 2007). An unprejudiced reading of The\nStructure of Iki reveals no fascist tendencies whatsoever, and\nthe nationalist themes are innocuous, simply calling for a remembering\nof what is valuable in the Japanese tradition and likely to be lost\nbeneath the waves of modernization—in a world where connections\nwith the past were withering and Japan was warding off the\ncolonization of East and South Asia by the Western powers.  Kuki is a fascinating thinker, and The Structure of Iki,\nwhile occasionally tortuous because of its commitment to a strictly\nEuropean methodology, illuminates some fascinating aspects of the\nJapanese aesthetic tradition while at the same time engaging the\ndeepest levels of experience anywhere. \n\nA distinctive notion in Japanese aesthetic discourse is that of the\n“cut” (kire) or,\n“cut-continuity” (kire-tsuzuki). The\n“cut” is a basic trope in the Rinzai School of Zen Buddhism,\nespecially as exemplified in the teachings of the Zen master Hakuin\n(1686–1769). For Hakuin the aim of “seeing into one’s own\nnature” can only be realized if one has “cut off the root\nof life”: “You must be prepared to let go your hold when\nhanging from a sheer precipice, to die and return again to life”\n(Hakuin, 133–35). The cut appears as a fundamental feature in the\ndistinctively Japanese art of flower arrangement called\nikebana. The term means literally “making flowers\nlive”—a strange name, on first impression at least, for an\nart that begins by initiating their death. There is an exquisite essay\nby Nishitani Keiji on this marvelous art, in which organic life is cut\noff precisely in order to let the true nature of the flower to come to\nthe fore (Nishitani, 23–7). There is something curiously\ndeceptive, from the Buddhist viewpoint of the impermanence of all\nthings, about plants, which, lacking locomotion and by sinking roots\ninto the earth, assume an appearance of being especially “at\nhome” wherever they are. In severing the flowers from their\nroots, Nishitani suggests, and placing them in an alcove (itself cut\noff from direct light, as Tanizaki remarks), one is letting them show\nthemselves as they truly are: as absolutely rootless as every other\nbeing in this world of radical impermanence. \n\nThe notion of cut-continuation is exemplified in the highly stylized\ngait of the actors in the Nō drama. The actor slides\nthe foot along the floor with the toes raised, and then\n“cuts” off the movement by quickly lowering the toes to\nthe floor—and beginning at that precise moment the sliding\nmovement along the floor with the other foot. This stylization of the\nnatural human walk draws attention to the episodic nature of life,\nwhich is also reflected in the pause between every exhalation of air\nfrom the lungs and the next inhalation. Through attending to the\nbreath in zen meditation one becomes aware that the pause between\nexhalation and inhalation is different—more of a cut—from\nthat between inhalation and exhalation. This reflects the possibility\nof life’s being cut off at any moment: the one exhalation that isn’t\nfollowed by an inhalation, known as “breathing one’s\nlast.” \n\nCutting also appears in the “cut-syllable”\n(kireji) in the art of haiku poetry, which\ncuts off one image from—at the same time as it links it\nto—the next. There is a famous cut-syllable, ya, at the end of the\nfirst line of the best known haiku by Bashō, the most famous\nhaiku poet: \n\nThe most distinctively Japanese style of garden, the “dry\nlandscape” (karesansui) garden, owes its existence to\nthe landscape’s being “cut off” from the natural world\nbeyond its borders. The epitome of this style is the rock garden at\nRyōanji in Kyoto, where fifteen “mountain”-shaped\nrocks are set in beds of moss in a rectangular “sea” of\nwhite gravel.  \n Larger Photographs of the Dry Landscape Garden at Ryōanji \n (The Japanese word for landscape, sansui, means literally\n“mountains waters”: see Berthier 2000.) At Ryōanji\nthe rock garden is cut off from the outside by a splendid wall that is\nnevertheless low enough to permit a view of the natural\nsurroundings. This cut, which is in a way doubled by the angled roof\nthat runs along the top of the wall and seems to cut it off, is most\nevident in the contrast between movement and stillness. Above and\nbeyond the wall there is nature in movement: branches wave and sway,\nclouds float by, and the occasional bird flies past. But unless rain\nor snow is falling, or a stray leaf is blown across, the only movement\nvisible within the garden is shadowed or illusory, as the sun or moon\ncasts slow-moving shadows of tree branches on the motionless gravel. \n\nThe garden is cut off on the near side too, by a border of pebbles\n(larger, darker, and more rounded than the pieces of gravel) that runs\nalong the east and north edges. There is a striking contrast between\nthe severe rectangularity of the garden’s borders and the irregular\nnatural forms of the rocks within them. The expanse of gravel is also\ncut through by the upthrust of the rocks from below: earth energies\nmounting and peaking in irruptions of stone. Each group of rocks is\ncut off from the others by the expanse of gravel, and the separation is\nenhanced by the “ripple” patterns in the raking that\nsurrounds each group (and some individual rocks). And yet the overall\neffect of these cuttings is actually to intensify the invisible lines\nof connection among the rocks, whose interrelations exemplify the\nfundamental Buddhist insight of “dependent co-arising”\n(engi). \n\nThe rock garden also embodies the central Buddhist insight of impermanence. Insofar as its\nbeing cut off from the surrounding nature has the effect of drying up\nits organic life, which then no longer decays in the usual manner.\nBeing dried up (the kare of karesansui means\n“withered”), the mountains and waters of the garden at\nRyōanji at first appear less temporary than their counterparts\noutside, which manifest the cyclical changes that organic life is heir\nto. But just as plants look deceptively permanent thanks to their\nbeing rooted in the earth, so the rocks of the dry landscape garden\ngive a misleading impression of permanence, especially when one\nrevisits them over a period of years. As participants in (what Thoreau\ncalled) “the great central life” of the earth, rocks have\na life that unfolds in time sequences that are quite different from\nours—and yet also subject to the impermanence that conditions\nall things. \n\nThe garden at Ryōanji makes a brief but significant appearance\nin one of the classics of Japanese cinema, Ozu Yasujirō’s\nLate Spring (1949). It comes right after one of the film’s\nmost famous images: a vase standing on a tatami mat in front of a\nwindow on which silhouettes of bamboo are projected. The scene in\nquestion consists of eight shots, seven of which show the\nRyōanji rocks (of which there are fifteen in total), and which\nare separated and joined by seven cuts. (Ozu hardly ever uses any\nother transition than the cut, such as the wipe.) After two shots of\nrocks in the garden, the camera angle reverses and we see the main\nprotagonist with his friend—they are both fathers of\ndaughters—sitting on the wooden platform with the tops of two\nrocks occupying the lower part of the frame. Two rocks and two\nfathers. Cut to a close-up of the fathers from their left side, with\nno rocks in view. In their dark suits, and seated in the classic Ozu\n“overlapping triangles” configuration, leaning forward\ntoward the garden with their arms around knees drawn up toward their\nchins, they resemble two rocks. They talk about how they raise\nchildren who then go off to live their own lives. As they invoke such\nmanifestations of impermanence, they remain motionless except for the\noccasional nod or turn of the head. \n Enlarged Sequence of Stills from Late Spring \n\nIn their brief conversation by the edge of the garden, the two fathers\ndo little more than exchange platitudes about family life—and\nyet the scene is a profoundly moving expression of the human\ncondition. It gains this effect from the assimilation of the figures\nof the two men to rocks, which seems to affirm the persistence of\ncycles of impermanence. These images of assimilation capture one of\nthe central ideas behind the dry landscape garden: that of the\ncontinuum between human consciousness and stone, which is also\nunderstandable as the kinship of awareness with its original\nbasis. \n\nThe opening shots of Tokyo Story (1953), which some consider\nOzu’s greatest film, are also exemplary with respect to the\ncutting. The first shot shows a shrine sculpture to the left of center\nand behind it an estuary with a boat chugging along to the right, in\nthe direction of a gradual rise of hills on the horizon. After ten\nseconds, just as the boat is about to disappear beyond the\nframe—there is a cut to the pavement on the side of a street. A\ncart now occupies the left foreground of the frame, and beside it\nstand two large bottles (Ozu’s signature shapes). Eight small children\nin school uniform walk away from the camera to the right. Continuity\nis provided by a parallel between the river and horizon of the first\nscene and the horizontal lines of the pavement and houses in the\nsecond, as well as by the movement toward the right. Also aurally by\nthe continuing sound of the boat’s putt-putting. A ninth child appears\nand as he passes the bottles and reaches the center of the\nframe—there is a cut to a shot over the roofs of houses of a\ntrain traveling to the right, with behind it the buildings of a shrine\nor temple, and then hills behind those. The putting sound of the boat\ncontinues before being drowned out by the sound of the train, and the\nalmost horizontal line of the train’s passage continue to be congruent\nwith those of the street, descending gradually to the right. Smoke\nissues from two chimneys at left and center, the scene lasting fifteen\nseconds. \n\nAs the end of the train reaches the center of the frame—the\nsound continues but there is a cut to a closer shot of the train from\nthe hill side, so that it is now moving up along a diagonal to the\nleft. Behind the houses on the other side of the train is the estuary\nagain. As the train’s whistle blows—there is a cut to a shrine\nsurrounded by pine trees and statuary standing on an embankment with\nthe estuary in the background on the far left. Continuity is provided\nby a chimney in the foreground that spouts smoke as the train’s steam\nwhistle continues. The main line has reverted to a horizontal line\nrising toward the right. After six seconds, the shortest scene so\nfar—there is a cut to a grandfather and grandmother sitting on\nthe tatami matting of their home in the village, facing toward the\nright. The grandfather, consulting a timetable, says, “We’ll\npass Osaka at around 6:00 this evening,” referring to a train\ntrip they are just about to take to Tokyo, which will initiate the\nfilm’s main action. \n Enlarged Sequence of Stills from Tokyo Story \n For each cut Ozu has arranged for at least one formal element to\nprovide continuity (kire-tsuzuki) between the adjacent\nscenes. There are of course other directors capable of consummate\ncuts, but a study of Ozu’s show them\nto constitute what may be “the kindest cut of all” in\nworld cinema.","contact.mail":"adamloughnane@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
