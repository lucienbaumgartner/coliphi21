Like any\n“philosophy of X”, it presupposes knowledge of its target.\nHowever, unlike philosophy of science, say, the target of philosophy\nof music is a practice most people have a significant background in,\nmerely as a result of being members of a musical culture. Music plays\na central role in many people’s lives. Thus, as with the central\nquestions of metaphysics and epistemology, not only can most people\nquickly grasp the philosophical questions music raises, they tend to\nhave thought about some of those questions before encountering the\nacademic discipline itself. (This is as good a place as any to note\nthat I, like most in the English-speaking philosophical world, focus\nexclusively on Western musical traditions. For criticism of this\ntendency, see Alperson 2009. For some exceptions to it, see S. Davies\n2001: 254–94) and Feagin 2007.)\n\n\nMusic is perhaps the art that presents the most philosophical puzzles.\nUnlike painting, its works often have multiple instances, none of\nwhich can be identified with the work itself. Thus, the question of\nwhat exactly the work is is initially more puzzling than the\nsame question about works of painting, which appear (at least\ninitially) to be ordinary physical objects. Unlike much literature,\nthe instances of a work are performances, which offer interpretations\nof the work, yet the work can also be interpreted (perhaps in a\ndifferent sense) independently of any performance, and performances\nthemselves can be interpreted. This talk of\n“interpretation” points to the fact that we find music an\nart steeped with meaning, and yet, unlike drama, pure instrumental\nmusic has no obvious semantic content. This quickly raises the\nquestion of why we should find music so valuable. Central to many\nphilosophers’ thinking on these subjects has been music’s\napparent ability to express emotions while remaining an abstract art\nin some sense.\n\n\nThis entry focuses almost exclusively on work in the philosophy of\nmusic that is recent—from within the last fifty years—and\nin an analytic vein (broadly construed). For a much broader\nintroduction to philosophy of music, covering its history, major\nfigures, connections with other disciplines, and a wider range of\ntopics, see Gracyk & Kania 2011. Useful single-author overviews\ninclude Scruton 1997, Kivy 2002, and Hamilton 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor most of this entry, I focus on “pure” or\n“absolute” music—instrumental music that has no\nnon-musical aspects, elements, or accompaniments. Most of the\nphilosophers whose work is discussed below also put the focus here,\nfor at least three reasons. The first is that pure music often\npresents the most difficult philosophical problems. It is less\npuzzling how a musical setting of a maudlin text could be expressive\nof sadness, for instance, than how a piece of music without even a\nprogrammatic text could be, since the emotional expression could\nsomehow be transferred to the music from the text. The second reason\nis that, though the problems are more difficult, the solutions are\nlikely to be more easily evaluated in the pure case. Just as\napportioning blame is easier when one person is responsible for a\ncrime than when the blame must be divided between a number of\nconspirators, the success of a solution to the problem of musical\nexpressiveness may be clearer if it can explain the expressiveness of\npure music. Thirdly, it is certain that the expressiveness of pure\nmusic will play a role in the expressiveness of “impure”\nmusic. Though its text may contribute to the expressiveness of a song,\nfor instance, the musical aspects of the song must play some role. A\nmaudlin text set to a jauntily upbeat melody will clearly not have the\nsame overall expressiveness as the same text set to a plodding dirge.\nThough I have used expressiveness as an example here, these same\npoints will apply to discussions of musical understanding and value.\nThere may also be interesting questions about the ontology of\n“impure” music, but it is not clear they will be of the\nsame kind as those about the expressiveness, understanding, and value\nof such music. (For a sustained critique of this general approach, see\nRidley 2004.) \nGiven the global prevalence of rock music, broadly construed, it is\nplausible that song is the most common kind of music listened to in\nthe contemporary world. Film and other motion pictures, such as\ntelevision and video-games, are also ubiquitous. There has been some\nsignificant work done on the aesthetics of song (Levinson 1987; Gracyk\n2001; Bicknell & Fisher 2013; Bicknell 2015), music drama (Kivy\n1988b, 1994; Goehr 1998), and film music (Carroll 1988: 213–225;\nLevinson 1996b; Kivy 1997a; Smith 1996). (See also the chapters in\npart V of Gracyk & Kania 2011; on hybrid art forms more generally,\nsee Levinson 1984 and Ridley 2004.) However, it seems that there is\nplenty of room for further work on the aesthetics of impure music.\n“Muzak” is another musical phenomenon that is ubiquitous,\nyet has received little serious attention from aestheticians, being\nused primarily as an example to elicit disgust. Whether or not there\nis anything interesting to say about Muzak philosophically, as opposed\nto psychologically or sociologically, remains to be seen. \nExplications of the concept of music usually begin with the idea that\nmusic is organized sound. They go on to note that this\ncharacterization is too broad, since there are many examples of\norganized sound that are not music, such as human speech, and the\nsounds non-human animals and machines make. There are two further\nkinds of necessary conditions philosophers have added in attempts to\nfine tune the initial idea. One is an appeal to “tonality”\nor essentially musical features such as pitch and rhythm (Scruton\n1997: 1–79; Hamilton 2007: 40–65; Kania 2011a). Another is\nan appeal to aesthetic properties or experience (Levinson 1990a;\nScruton 1997: 1–96; Hamilton 2007: 40–65). As these\nreferences suggest, one can endorse either of these conditions in\nisolation, or both together. It should also be noted that only Jerrold\nLevinson and Andrew Kania attempt definitions in terms of necessary\nand sufficient conditions. Both Roger Scruton and Andy Hamilton reject\nthe possibility of a definition in terms of necessary and sufficient\nconditions. Hamilton explicitly asserts that the conditions he defends\nare “salient features” of an unavoidably vague\nphenomenon. \nThe main problem with the first kind of condition is that every sound\nseems capable of being included in a musical performance, and thus\ncharacterizing the essentially musical features of sounds seems\nhopeless. (We need only consider the variety of “untuned”\npercussion available to a conservative symphonist, though we could\nalso consider examples of wind machines, typewriters, and toilets, in\nRalph Vaughan Williams’s Sinfonia Antartica, Leroy\nAnderson’s The Typewriter, and Yoko Ono’s\n“Toilet Piece/Unknown”.) Defenders of such a condition\nhave turned to sophisticated intentional or subjective theories of\ntonality in order to overcome this problem. If the essentially musical\nfeatures of a sound are not intrinsic to it, but somehow related to\nhow it is produced or received, we can classify just one of two\n“indiscernible” sounds as music. The details of\none’s theory of essentially musical features will determine how\nmuch avant-garde “sound art” counts as music. \nIf one endorses only an aesthetic condition, and not a tonality\ncondition, one still faces the problem of poetry—non-musical\naesthetically organized sounds. Levinson, who takes this approach,\nexcludes organized linguistic sounds explicitly (1990a). This raises\nthe question of whether there are further distinctions to be made\nbetween arts of sound. Andy Hamilton defends a tripartite distinction,\narguing that sound art, as opposed to both music and\nliterature, was established as a significant art form in the twentieth\ncentury (2007: 40–65). This is one reason that Hamilton endorses\nboth tonal and aesthetic conditions on music; without the former,\nLevinson is unable to make such a distinction. On the other hand, by\nendorsing an aesthetic condition, Hamilton is forced to exclude scales\nand Muzak, for instance, from the realm of music. Kania (2013a)\nsuggests that it is a mistake to think that music is necessarily an\nart, any more than language. He argues that we should distinguish\nmusic simpliciter from its artistic uses, just as we do in\nthe cases of language and literature, depiction and painting, and so\non. By means of a disjunctive condition, Kania also adds a further\ndistinction to Hamilton’s set. Kania argues that music is  \n(1) any event intentionally produced or organized (2) to be heard, and\n(3) either (a) to have some basic musical feature, such as\npitch or rhythm, or (b) to be listened to for such features.\n(2011a: 12)  \nThe latter disjunct allows for two indiscernible works, neither of\nwhich strictly possesses basic musical features, yet one of which is\nmusic and the other sound art because of the complex way in which the\nformer is intended to be approached. Kania’s approach thus draws\non some of the machinery of recent definitions of art in place of an\nappeal to an aesthetic condition. In doing so, however, it may be that\nKania has slipped back into defining music as essentially artistic.\nFor trenchant criticisms of the attempt to give necessary and\nsufficient conditions for music, see Kingsbury & McKeown-Green\n2009 and McKeown-Green 2014. Stephen Davies (2012) suggests that an\nadequate definition would have to deflect the complex nature of music,\nappealing at least to its intentional, structural, historical, and\ncultural aspects. \nHaving discussed complications, it’s worth returning to the\nbasic idea of “organized sound”. Most theorists note that\nmusic does not consist entirely of sounds. Most obviously, much music\nincludes rests. You might think that silence can function only to\norganize the sounds of music. One counterargument is that an\nunderstanding listener listens to the rests, just as she\nlistens to the sounds (Kania 2010). Another is to provide putative\ncases of music in which the silences are not structural in the way\nordinary rests are. John Cage’s 4′33″ is\nfrequently discussed, though there is broad agreement that this piece\nis not silent—its content is the ambient sounds that occur\nduring its performance. Anyway, both Stephen Davies (1997a) and Andrew\nKania (2010) argue that Cage’s piece is not music—Davies\nbecause those sounds fail to qualify as organized, Kania because they\nfail to meet a tonality condition. Kania considers several other\ncontenders for the label of “silent music”, arguing that\nthere are indeed extant examples, most notably Erwin Schulhoff’s\n“In Futurum” from his Fünf Pittoresken,\nwhich predates Cage’s 4′33″ by some 33\nyears. \nMusical ontology is the study of the kinds of musical things there are\nand the relations that hold between them. The most discussed issues\nwithin this field have been the metaphysical nature of works of\nclassical music (the “fundamentalist debate”), and what it\nis to give an “authentic performance” of such works.\nRecently there has been growing interest in the ontologies of other\nmusical traditions, such as rock and jazz, and discussion of the\nmethodology and value of musical ontology. (For a more detailed\noverview of these debates, see Kania 2008a,b, 2013b, and Matheson\n& Caplan 2011.) \nMusical works in the Western classical tradition admit of multiple\ninstances (performances). Much of the debate over the nature of such\nworks thus reads like a recapitulation of the debate over the\n“problem of universals”; the range of proposed candidates\ncovers the spectrum of fundamental ontological theories. We might\ndivide musical ontologists into the realists, who posit the existence\nof musical works, and the anti-realists, who deny their existence.\nRealism has been more popular than anti-realism, but there have been\nmany conflicting realist views. I begin with three unorthodox realist\nviews before moving on to more orthodox Platonist and nominalist\ntheories, concluding with a consideration of anti-realism. \nIdealists hold that musical works are mental entities. Collingwood\n(1938) and Sartre (1940) respectively take musical (and other) works\nto be imaginary objects and experiences. The most serious objections\nto this kind of view are that (i) it fails to make works\nintersubjectively accessible, since the number of works going under\nthe name The Rite of Spring will be as multifarious as the\nimaginative experiences people have at performances with that name,\nand (ii) it makes the medium of the work irrelevant to an\nunderstanding of it. One might have the same imaginative experience in\nresponse to both a live performance and a recording of The Rite of\nSpring, yet it seems an open question whether the two media are\naesthetically equivalent. But see Cox 1986, and Cray & Matheson\nforthcoming, for recent attempts to revive idealism. \nDavid Davies argues that musical works, like all works of art, are\nactions, in particular the compositional actions of their\ncomposers (2004). Thus he revives what we might call an “action\ntheory” of the ontology of art. (An earlier defender of such a\nview is Gregory Currie (1989), who argues that artworks are\ntypes of action, rather than the particular actions\nwith which Davies identifies them.) Although deciding between theories\nof musical ontology is always to some extent a matter of finding a\nbalance between the benefits of a theory and its cost in terms of our\npre-theoretic intuitions, action theories have a particularly hard row\nto hoe since they imply that an instance of a work is some action\nperformed by a composer, rather than a performance. In order to make\nup for such damage to our intuitions the theoretical benefits of an\naction theory would have to be quite extensive. \nGuy Rohrbaugh has proposed a new ontological category for musical, and\nother multiple works of art (2003). He argues that since the kinds of\nthings we attribute to musical and other art works, such as modal and\ntemporal flexibility, cannot be accounted for by any extant\nontological theory and, moreover, that these problems arise not just\nfor artworks, but such things as “species …, clubs, sorts\nof artifact, and words” (199), we are justified in positing a\nnew kind of entity: a historical individual that is\n“embodied in”, but not constituted by, physical things\nsuch as scores and performances. (For criticism of this view, see Dodd\n2007: 143–66.) \nMost theorists think that some kind of Platonist or nominalist theory\nof musical works is more plausible than those so far considered.\nNominalists hold that musical works are collections of concrete\nparticulars, such as scores and performances (Goodman 1968; Predelli\n1995, 1999a,b, 2001; Caplan & Matheson 2006). While this view is\nattractive because it appeals only to the least problematic kinds of\nentities, it faces serious challenges. Though many of our claims about\nmusical works may be paraphrasable into claims about sets of possible\nperformances, some seem to make intractable reference to works. For\ninstance, most performances of The Rite of Spring—even\nincluding the possible ones—include several wrong notes. Thus it\nis difficult to imagine how the paraphrase schema will avoid the\nnonsensical conclusion that The Rite of Spring contains\nseveral wrong notes. The solution to this problem seems to lie in an\nappeal to the work as independent of its various performances, but\nsuch an appeal seems unavailable to the nominalist. (For a recent\ndefense of nominalist theories against some standard objections, see\nTillman 2011.) \nPlatonism, the view that musical works are abstract objects, is\nperhaps the currently dominant view, since it respects more of our\npre-theoretic intuitions about musical works than any of the other\ntheories. On the other hand, it is the most ontologically puzzling,\nsince abstract objects are not well understood. Nonetheless, Platonism\nhas been tenacious, with much of the debate centering around what\nvariety of abstract object musical works are. What we might call\n“simple Platonism” (known simply as\n“Platonism” in the literature), is that works are eternal\nexistents, existing in neither space nor time (Kivy 1983a,b, Dodd\n2007). According to “complex Platonism”, musical works\ncome to exist in time as the result of human action. The view is\nmotivated by a number of features of musical practice, including the\nintuition that musical works are creatable, the attribution of various\naesthetic and artistic properties to works, and the fine-grained\nindividuation of works and performances (e.g., in terms of who\ncomposed them, or what instruments they are properly performed upon)\n(Ingarden 1961; Thomasson 2004; Wolterstorff 1980; Wollheim 1968:\n1–10, 74–84; Levinson 1980, 1990b, 2013a; S. Davies 2001:\n37–43; Howell 2002; Stecker 2003a: 84–92). \nIn contrast to all these realist views stand those of the\nanti-realists, who deny that there are any such things as musical\nworks. An early proponent of such a view is Richard Rudner (1950),\nthough it is difficult to say whether he is best interpreted as an\neliminativist or a fictionalist, the two anti-realist views currently\non the table. According to eliminativists, there are no such things as\nmusical works, and thus we ought to stop trying to refer to them. Ross\nCameron (2008) defends such a view, but only with respect to\n“Ontologese”—the language we speak when we do\nontology. He argues that ordinary English locutions such as\n“there are many musical works” can be true without there\nbeing any musical works. (For critical discussion, see Predelli 2009\nand Stecker 2009.) According to fictionalists, the value of discourse\nabout musical works is not truth, and thus we ought not to abandon the\ndiscourse despite the non-existence of its subject matter, but rather\nadopt a different, make-believe attitude towards it (or perhaps we\nalready do so). (See Kania 2008c, 2013b; for criticism, see Letts\n2015.) \nMuch of this debate over the fundamental ontological category to which\nmusical works belong has turned on “technical” issues,\nthat is, controversial general metaphysical claims about the nature of\nproperties, causation, embodiment, and so on (e.g., Howell 2002;\nTrivedi 2002; Caplan & Matheson 2004, 2006; Dodd 2007; Cameron\n2008). In the face of this, some theorists have pointed out that\nmusical works are cultural entities, and thus the methodology\nappropriate to uncovering their ontological status might be quite\ndifferent from that of general metaphysics (Goehr 1992; S. Davies\n2003a; D. Davies 2004; Thomasson 2006, Kania 2008c). There currently\nseems to be as much interest in the methodological questions as in\nfirst-order theorizing. (For recent examples, see Kania 2008c; D.\nDavies 2009, 2017; Predelli 2009; Stecker 2009; Dodd 2010, 2013; and\nMag Uidhir 2013.) \nIt might seem that, since musical works are ontologically multiple,\nonce we have figured out their true nature, we will know what relation\nholds between the work and its instances. However, since the\nfundamentalist debate is about the basic ontological category to which\nworks belong, resolving that debate may leave open many questions\nabout the instantiation relation. For instance, is the use of a\nharpsichord required to instance Bach’s Brandenburg Concerto\nNo. 5 in performance? Would producing harpsichord-like sounds on\na synthesizer do just as well? What about using another keyboard\ninstrument from Bach’s time, or a modern piano? Learning that\nmusical works are, say, eternal types will not necessarily help settle\nthis issue of “authentic performance”, which is perhaps\nthe most discussed ontological issue, of interest to philosophers,\nmusicologists, musicians, and audiences alike. \nThere have been two sources of widespread confusion in the debate over\nauthenticity in performance. One is a failure to recognize that\nauthenticity is not simply a property, but a relation that comes in\ndegrees and along different “vectors”. Something may be\nmore authentic in one regard and less authentic in another (S. Davies\n2001: 203–5). Another is the assumption that authenticity is an\nevaluative concept, in the sense that “authentic” implies\n“good”. That this is not the case is clear from the fact\nthat an authentic murderer is not a good thing (S. Davies 2001: 204).\nThus, our value judgments will be complex functions of the extent to\nwhich we judge performances authentic in various regards, and the\nvalues we assign to those various kinds of authenticity. \nThe central kind of authenticity that has been discussed is\nauthenticity with respect to the instantiation of the work. Most agree\nthat the fullest such authenticity requires the production of the\nright pitches in the right order. Pure sonicists argue that\nthis is sufficient (e.g., Kivy 1988a). Timbral sonicists\nargue that these pitches must also have timbres reflecting the\ncomposer’s instrumentation (e.g., Dodd 2007: 201–39).\nInstrumentalists argue that such sounds must be produced on\nthe kinds of instruments specified in the score (e.g., Levinson\n1990c). Much of the debate is over what kinds of aesthetic or artistic\nproperties are essential to musical works. If the limpid textures of\nBach’s Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 are essential to it,\nthen one cannot authentically instance the work using a grand piano\ninstead of a harpsichord. As such, the debate reflects a wider one in\naesthetics, musical and otherwise, between formalists (or\nempiricists, or structuralists), who believe that the most important\nproperties of a work are intrinsic ones, accessible to listeners\nunaware of the historical and artistic context in which it was\ncreated, and contextualists, who believe that a work is\nessentially tied to its context of creation. Stephen Davies has argued\nfor a strong contextualism, claiming that one cannot give a single\nanswer to the question of whether particular instrumentation is\nrequired for the fully authentic instantiation of a work. Works can be\nontologically “thicker” or “thinner” as a\nresult of the specifications of a composer working within certain\nconventions (1991, 2001). The more properties of an authentic\nperformance a particular work specifies, the thicker it is. Thus for\nsome works (typically earlier in the history of Western music)\ninstrumentation is flexible, while for others (for example, Romantic\nsymphonies) quite specific instrumentation is required for fully\nauthentic performances. \nIn addition to the question of what constitutes authenticity, there\nhas been debate over its attainability and value. Those who question\nits attainability point to our historical distance from the creation\nof some works (Young 1988). We may no longer be able to read the\nnotation in which the work is recorded, or construct or play the\ninstruments for which it was written. If so, full authenticity is not\nattainable. But we rarely have no idea about these matters, and thus\nwe might achieve partial authenticity (S. Davies 2001: 228–34).\nThose who question the value of authenticity often target kinds other\nthan work-instantiation. For instance, one might question the value of\nproducing a performance that authentically captures the sound of\nperformances as they took place in the context of a work’s\ncomposition, on the basis that musicians were not as highly skilled\nthen as now, for instance (Young 1988: 229–31). Such arguments,\nthough, have no consequences for the value of work-instantiation. Some\nargue that although we might attain an authentic instance of a work,\nthe idea that we might thereby hear the work as its contemporaries\nheard it is wishful thinking, since the musical culture in which we\nare immersed enforces ways of listening upon us that we cannot escape\n(Young 1988: 232–7). Thus the point of such authenticity is\nquestioned. In response, we may consider not only the possibility that\nwe are in a better position to appreciate historical works than\ncontemporary ones, but also the remarkable flexibility people seem to\nshow in enjoying many different kinds of music from throughout history\nand the world (S. Davies 2001: 234–7). \n(For an excellent overview of the authentic performance debate, see S.\nDavies 2001: 201–53. For an investigation of authenticity with\nrespect to things other than instantiation of the work, see Kivy 1995,\nGracyk 2001, and Bicknell 2015. Some recent work has, like the\nfundamentalist debate, taken a methodological turn, e.g., S. Davies\n2008; Dodd 2010, 2015.) \nA second area that may be independent of the fundamentalist debate is\nthat of comparative ontology. (For dispute over this framing issue,\nsee Brown 2011, 2012, and Kania 2012.) Just as classical works from\ndifferent historical periods may be ontologically diverse, so may\nworks from different contemporary traditions. Theodore Gracyk has\nargued that instances of works of rock music are not performances.\nRather, the work is instanced by playing a copy of a recording on an\nappropriate device (1996). Stephen Davies has argued that rock is more\nlike classical music than Gracyk acknowledges, with works for\nperformance at the heart of the tradition, albeit works for a\ndifferent kind of performance (2001: 30–6). Gracyk’s view\nhas been amplified and defended in attempts to find a place for\ncomposition, live performance, and performance skill within his basic\nframework (Kania 2006, Bruno 2013, Bartel 2017). \nWork on the ontology of jazz has centered around the nature of\nimprovisation, particularly the relation between improvisation and\ncomposition (Alperson 1984, 1998; Valone 1985; Brown 1996, 2000;\nHagberg 1998; Gould & Keaton 2000; Sterritt 2000; and Young &\nMatheson 2000; Bresnahan 2015; Love 2016; Magnus 2016). This has been\na useful reminder that not all music is the performance of\npre-composed works (Wolterstorff 1987: 115–29). However, it must\nbe noted that improvisation can occur within the context of such a\nwork, as in the performance of an improvised cadenza in a classical\nconcerto. Some have argued that there is not as significant a\ndistinction between improvisation and composition as is usually\nthought (Alperson 1984). Others have argued that all performance\nrequires improvisation (Gould & Keaton 2000). Yet others restrict\nthe possibility of improvisation to certain kinds of musical\nproperties, such as “structural” rather than\n“expressive” ones (Young & Matheson 2000). However,\nthe arguments are not compelling. Usually they turn on equivocal use\nof terms such as “composition” and\n“performance”, or beg the question by defining\nimprovisation in terms of deviation from a score or variation of a\nlimited set of “expressive” properties. \nThough jazz is not necessarily improvisational, and very few jazz\nperformances lack any sort of prior compositional process, the\ncentrality of improvisation to jazz presents a challenge to the\nmusical ontologist. One might argue that jazz works are ontologically\nlike classical works—composed for multiple, different\nperformances—but that they tend to be thinner, leaving more room\nfor improvisation (Gould & Keaton 2000; Young & Matheson\n2000). The difficulty is to specify the work without conflating one\nwork with another, since tokening the melody is not required, and many\nworks share the same harmonic structure. As a result, some argue that\nthe performance is itself the work (Alperson 1984; Hagberg 2002; S.\nDavies 2001: 16–19). One problem here is parity with classical\nmusic. If jazz performances are musical works in their own right, it\nis difficult to deny that status to classical performances of works.\nThis seems to multiply works beyond what we usually think is\nnecessary. A third possibility is that in jazz there are no works,\nonly performances (Brown 1996, 2000: 115; Kania 2011b). This is\ncounterintuitive if “work” is an evaluative term, but it\nis not obvious that this is the case. \nJulian Dodd (2014a) argues that the kinds of considerations adduced in\nfavor of these views confuse questions of ontology with questions of\nvalue. Jazz is ontologically like early classical music, according to\nDodd: the focus of critical attention is the improvisatory performance\nrather than the composition it instantiates, but that composition is\nno less a musical work for that difference in critical emphasis.\nSimilar considerations might be adduced against the increasingly\ncomplicated ontologies of rock referred to above. Such arguments\nreturn us to debates about the methodology of musical ontology. \nA third topic of ontological discussion at the “higher”\nlevel is the nature of the elements of musical works, such as\nmelodies, harmonies, and rhythms, and how they come together to form\ncomplex wholes. At present only Roger Scruton (1997: 19–79;\n2007) and Stephen Davies (2001: 47–71) have addressed these\nquestions in depth from a philosophical perspective, but they will be\nimportant to understanding the very nature of music, if an appeal is\nmade to such “basic musical features” as pitch and rhythm\nin the definition of music (see\n section 1.2,\n above). \nThe most widely discussed philosophical question concerning music and\nthe emotions is that of how music can express emotions. (For a more\nextensive introduction, see part II of Gracyk & Kania 2011; for a\nthorough treatment, see S. Davies 1994.) There is a second group of\nquestions centered around listeners’ emotional responses to\nmusic. These include questions about why and how we respond\nemotionally to music, the value of such responses, and why we choose\nto listen to music that elicits “negative” responses from\nus, such as sadness. Theorists typically restrict themselves to\n“pure” or “absolute” music for simplicity,\nthough it is surprising how many central examples fall outside this\nboundary through being program music or song. The reason given for the\nrestriction is usually that it is easier to understand how music with\nan accompanying text, say, could express the emotions evident in the\ntext. On the other hand, an important criterion for the evaluation of\nsuch music is how appropriately the composer has set her chosen text\nto music. So an accompanying text is clearly not sufficient for the\nmusical expression of an emotion. Thus, a better reason for initially\nputting such music to one side is that the interrelation of music and\ntext, or other elements, is likely to be highly complex, and best\napproached with as well-developed a theory of the more basic phenomena\nin hand as possible. \nPieces of music, or performances of them, are standardly said to be\nhappy, sad, and so on. Music’s emotional expressiveness is a\nphilosophical problem since the paradigm expressers of emotions are\npsychological agents, who have emotions to express. Neither pieces of\nmusic, nor performances of them, are psychological agents, thus it is\npuzzling that such things could be said to express emotions. One\nimmediately helpful distinction is that between expression and\nexpressiveness, or expressivity. Expression is something persons do,\nnamely, the outward manifestation of their emotional states.\nExpressiveness is something artworks, and possibly other things,\npossess. It is presumably related in some way to expression, and yet\ncannot simply be expression for the reason just given. \nAn obvious way to connect expressiveness with expression is to argue\nthat pieces of music or performances of them are expressions\nof emotion—not the piece’s or performance’s\nemotions, but rather those of the composer or performer. There are two\nmajor problems with this “expression theory”. The first is\nthat neither composers nor performers often experience the emotions\ntheir music is expressive of as it is produced. Nor does it seem\nunlikely that a composer could create, or a performer perform, a piece\nexpressive of an emotion that she had never experienced. This is not\nto deny that a composer could write a piece expressive of her\nemotional state, but two things must be observed. The first is that\nfor the expression theory to be an account of musical expressiveness,\nat least all central cases of expressiveness must follow this model,\nwhich is not the case. The second is that if a composer is to express\nher sadness, say, by writing a sad piece, she must write the right\nkind of piece. In other words, if she is a bad composer she might fail\nto express her emotion. This brings us to the second major problem for\nthe expression theory. If a composer can fail to express her emotions\nin a piece, then the music she writes is expressive independently of\nthe emotion she is experiencing. Thus music’s expressiveness\ncannot be explained in terms of direct expression. \nThose usually cited as classic expression theorists include Tolstoy\n(1898), Dewey (1934), and Collingwood (1938). (A classic critique is\nTormey 1971: 97–127.) These theorists have been defended in\nrecent discussions, however, from accusations that they hold the\nsimple view outlined above. See, for example, Ridley 2003 and Robinson\n2005: 229–57. Jenefer Robinson has attempted to revive the\nexpression theory, though she defends it as an interesting and\nvaluable use of music’s expressiveness, rather than an\naccount of expressiveness itself (2005: 229–347; 2011). \nA second way to link music’s expressiveness with actual felt\nemotions is through the audience. The “arousal theory” is,\nat its simplest, the claim that the expressiveness of a passage of\nmusic amounts to its tendency to arouse that emotion in an\nunderstanding listener. Some problems with this simple version can be\novercome. For instance, some emotions, such as fear, require a\nparticular kind of intentional object (something threatening), yet\nthere is no such object at hand when we hear fearful music. Thus it\nseems implausible to claim the music’s fearfulness resides in\nits arousal of fear in us. But the arousalist can broaden the class of\naroused emotions to include appropriate responses to the\nexpressed emotion, such as pity. It can also be objected that many\nunderstanding listeners are not moved to respond emotionally to music.\nBut the arousalist can simply restrict the class of listener to which\nhis theory appeals to those who are so moved. The main problem with\nthe theory seems more intractable. Essentially it is that in order for\na listener to respond appropriately to the music, she must discern the\nemotion expressed therein. This is most obvious when the response is a\nsympathetic, rather than empathetic, one. The listener’s\nresponse depends upon the emotion expressed, and thus the\nexpressiveness of the music cannot depend upon that response. (A\nsophisticated defense of the arousal theory is to be found in\nMatravers 1998: 145–224, though see the second thoughts in\nMatravers 2011.) \nDespite the problems of the arousal theory as the whole story of\nmusical expressiveness, there is a growing consensus, thanks largely\nto the work of Jenefer Robinson (1994, 2005), that our lower-level,\nless cognitive responses to music must play some role in the emotional\nexpressiveness we attribute to it. However, this role is likely to be\na causal one, rather than part of an analysis of what it is for music\nto be emotionally expressive. \nAt the other end of the spectrum from the expression and arousal\ntheories is “associationism”—the theory that\nmusic’s expressiveness is a matter of conventional association\nof certain musical elements, such as slow tempi, with certain\nemotional states, such as sadness. Again, though associations must\nplay some role in some cases of expression—for instance, cases\nof particular musical instruments (e.g., the snare drum) being\nassociated with particular situations (e.g., war)—this role is\nlikely to be a peripheral one. The main reason is the logical-priority\nproblem, already encountered by the arousal theory. The expressiveness\nof music seems closely related to the resemblance between the dynamic\ncharacter of both the music and the emotions it is expressive of. It\nis implausible that funeral dirges might just as easily have been in\nquick-paced compound time. Even in such cases as the snare drum, it\nseems possible that the instrument was chosen for the battlefield in\npart due to the expressive character of its sonic profile. \nThe cliché that music is “the language of the\nemotions” is often considered as a possible starting point for a\ntheory of musical expressiveness. The idea combines the attractive\nsimplicity of conventionality that associationism makes the basis of\nmusic’s meaning with the formalist notion that music’s\norder is to be understood in terms of syntax. (See Lerdahl &\nJackendoff 1983 for a theory along the latter lines.) However,\nalthough Deryck Cooke (1959) and Leonard Meyer (1956) are often cited\nas proponents, it is not clear that anyone holds a full-blown version\nof the theory. The central problem is the great disparities between\nlanguage and music, in terms of the ways in which each is both\nsyntactic and semantic (Jackendoff 2011). A serious subsidiary problem\nis that even if music were about the emotions in the way that\nlanguage can be, that would not account for music’s\nexpressiveness. The sentence “I am sad” is about\nthe emotions, but it is not expressive of sadness in the way\na sad face is, though I could use either to express my sadness. Most\npeople agree that music’s relation to emotion is more like that\nof a sad face than that of a sentence. (This last criticism is also\napplicable to Susanne Langer’s theory (1953) that music is about\nthe emotions in a symbolic yet non-linguistic way.) \nSeveral theorists have defended accounts of musical expressiveness\nknown variously as resemblance, contour, or appearance theories (e.g.,\nKivy 1989, though see Kivy 2002: 31–48 for recent qualms; Budd\n1995: 133–54; S. Davies 1994: 221–67). The central idea is\nthat music’s expressiveness consists in the resemblance between\nits dynamic character and the dynamic character of various aspects of\npeople experiencing emotions. The aspects appealed to include the\nphenomenology of the experience of the emotion, the emotion’s\ntypical facial expression, the contour of vocal expression typical of\na person experiencing the emotion, and the contour of bodily behavior\ntypical of such a person, including “gait, attitude, air,\ncarriage, posture, and comportment” (S. Davies 2006: 182).\nStephen Davies argues that such theories hold music to be expressive\nin a literal albeit secondary sense of the term. We say that a piece\nof music is sad in the same sense in which we say that a weeping\nwillow is sad (S. Davies 2006: 183). Such uses are no more\nmetaphorical than a claim that a chair has arms. \nJerrold Levinson agrees that there is an important resemblance between\nthe contour of music expressive of an emotion and the contour of\ntypical behavioral expressions of that emotion. He objects, however,\nthat such an account cannot be the whole, or even the most fundamental\npart of the story (Levinson 1996a, 2006b). He drives in a wedge\nprecisely at the point where an appeal is made to the resemblance\nbetween the music and typical behavioral expressions. He asks what the\nmanner and extent of the resemblance between the two must be,\nprecisely, in order for the music to count as expressive of some\nemotion. After all, as is often said, everything resembles everything\nelse in all sorts of ways, and so one could point out many\nresemblances between a funeral march and an expression of joy, or for\nthat matter a cup of coffee and sadness. The resemblance theorist must\ngive some account of why the funeral march, and not the cup of coffee,\nis expressive of sadness and not joy. Levinson claims that the obvious\nanswer here is that the funeral march is\n“readily-hearable-as” an expression of sadness. If this is\ncorrect, then the resemblance the music bears to emotional behavior is\nlogically secondary—a cause or ground of its expressiveness. The\nexpressiveness itself resides in the music’s disposition to\nelicit the imaginative response in us of hearing the music as a\nliteral expression of emotion. As a logical consequence, the\nimaginative experience prompted must include some agent whose\nexpression the music literally is. \nIn reply to this kind of objection, Stephen Davies has emphasized the\nrole of the listener’s response in resemblance theories. Such\nresponses have always been appealed to by such theories, as evidenced\nby Malcolm Budd’s talk of “hearing as” (1995:\n135–7), and Peter Kivy’s discussion of our tendency to\n“animate” that which we perceive (1980: 57–9). But\nDavies now makes the appeal quite explicit and central, devoting as\nmuch space to explication of the response-dependent nature of\nexpressiveness as to the role of resemblance (2006). To the extent\nthat the response is one of imaginative animation, there will be\nagreement between Levinson and the resemblance theorist. But Davies,\nat least, continues to resist Levinson’s theory of imagined\nliteral expression on two fronts. \nThe first is in his refusal to accord a role to imagination in our\nresponse to expressive music. For Davies, the response of the\nappropriate listener upon which the expressiveness of the music\ndepends is one of an experience of resemblance (2006:\n181–2). In other words, the answer to the question of the manner\nand extent to which music must resemble some behavioral expression in\norder to qualify as expressive of a particular emotion is simply\n“in whatever manner and to whatever extent leads us to\nexperience the music as resembling the emotion”. No further\nattempt at analysis is given, presumably because Davies believes this\nis the end of the philosophical line. Further explanation of our\ntendency to respond in this way to music will be in some other domain,\nsuch as the psychology of music. Since Davies’s theory posits at\nbase a contour-recognition experience while Levinson’s posits an\nimaginative experience of expression, the link between literal\nexpression and musical expressiveness looks closer in Levinson’s\ntheory than in Davies’s. An empirical consequence seems to be\nthat Davies’s theory will predict weaker emotional responses to\nmusic than Levinson’s. Whether or not this is an advantage or\ndisadvantage of the theory depends on the empirical facts about how we\nrespond emotionally to music. \nOn the second front Davies is more aggressive. He attacks the idea\nthat we imagine a persona inhabiting the music, or giving rise to it\nin some way as the literal expression of its emotional experiences\n(1997b; 2006: 189–90; see also Kivy 2002: 135–59; 2006;\nRidley 2007). The simplest objection is that there is empirical\nevidence that understanding listeners do not engage in any such\nimaginative activity. This is decisive if true, but there is plenty of\nroom to quibble about our ability to test for the right kinds of\nimaginative activity, the selection of the subjects, and so on. A\ndifferent kind of objection is that if the persona theory were true,\nexpressive music could not constrain our imaginative activity in such\na way as to yield convergent judgments of expressiveness among\nunderstanding listeners. That is, different people, or the same person\non different occasions, could imagine a single passage as the\nexpression of an imagined agent’s anger, excitement, passionate\nlove, and so on. The problem is compounded when we consider the\nnarrative(s) that we might imagine to explain the agent’s (or\nagents’) emotional progress in an extended work. It is not clear\neven how we might individuate one such agent from another, re-identify\nan agent over time, and so on. These criticisms seem a little\nuncharitable. As mentioned above, Levinson is open to a resemblance\naccount’s playing an important role in our identification of the\nparticular emotions expressed in a passage. So Levinson can simply\nhelp himself to whatever level of specificity of emotions expressed\nthe best resemblance account has to offer. As for the individuation\nand re-identification of the imagined agents, no mention has been made\nof such complexities so far and, as Levinson says, these “are\nmatters on which the account of basic musical expressiveness can\nremain agnostic” (2006b: 204). \nSince both the resemblance and ready-hearability theories make\nmusic’s expressiveness a matter of response-dependence, both\nmust answer the question of whose responses are to be taken into\naccount. Both appeal to listeners with understanding of the kind of\nmusic under discussion. This raises the question of what counts as\nunderstanding (a matter considered in\n section 4,\n below). One thing that cannot be appealed to in this connection,\nthough, is an ability to hear the right emotional expressiveness in\nmusic, for this would render any account circular. Levinson points out\nthat one can appeal to everything but such understanding of\nexpressiveness, and thinks that sensitivity to expressiveness will\ncome along with the rest (1996a: 109). Aside from this, though, there\nis the fact that some apparently understanding listeners simply deny\nthat music is expressive of emotion. Levinson thinks we can reasonably\nexclude such listeners from the class whose responses are appealed to\nin the analysis of expressiveness, since only those generally disposed\nto hear expressiveness are reasonably appealed to in determining the\nspecific expressiveness of a particular passage, which are the terms\nin which he puts his theory. \nThis suggestion raises the specter of an “error theory” of\nmusic’s expressiveness, that is, a theory that all claims of\nemotional expressiveness in music are strictly false. A major burden\nof such a theory is to explain away the widespread tendency to\ndescribe music in emotional terms. This has been attempted by arguing\nthat such descriptions are shorthand or metaphor for purely sonic\nfeatures (Urmson 1973), basic dynamic features (Hanslick 1854), purely\nmusical features (Sharpe 1982), or aesthetic properties (Zangwill\n2007). There are many problems with such views. For one thing, they\nseem committed to some sort of scheme for reduction of expressive\npredicates to other terms, such as sonic or musical ones, and such a\nscheme is difficult to imagine (Budd 1985a: 31–6). For another,\nanyone not drawn to this theory is likely to reject the claim that the\nparaphrase captures all that is of interest and value about the\npassage described, precisely because it omits the expressive\npredicates (Davies 1994: 153–4). Perhaps Levinson, Davies,\net al., are right that most people hear most music as\nemotionally expressive. It is a nice question, however, whether, if\nour musical culture fell into the grip of anti-expressivist\nformalism—in the future or the past—it would be\nappropriate to exclude ourselves from the reference class of listeners\nappealed to by such theories as those of Davies and Levinson. If so,\nthis would point to a kind of high-level contextualism or cultural\nrelativity about the expressiveness of music, making it a more\ncontingent matter than most theorists imply. On the other hand, such\nan occurrence may be unlikely if our tendency to “animate”\nnon-sentient objects is deeply rooted in our biology. \nThere are two main questions asked about our emotional responses to\npure music, apart from what role they play in expressiveness. The\nfirst is analogous to the “paradox of fiction”. It is not\nclear why we should respond emotionally to expressive music when we\nknow that no one is undergoing the emotions expressed. The second is a\nvariant of the “paradox of tragedy”. If some music arouses\n“negative” emotional responses in us, such as sadness, why\ndo we seek out the experience of such music? I address these questions\nin turn. \nOne might simply deny that we respond emotionally to music. R.A.\nSharpe (2000: 1–83), while stopping short of outright denial,\nsuggests that our emotional responses to music are a much smaller\ncomponent of our understanding experience of it than the philosophical\nliterature on the topic would suggest (see also Zangwill 2004). Peter\nKivy (1999) goes almost all the way, arguing that those who report\nemotional reactions to music are confusing the pleasure they take in\nthe beauty of the music, in all its expressive individuality, with the\nfeeling of the emotion expressed. \nThough most philosophers appeal to typical experience and empirical\ndata to reject the plausibility of Kivy’s position, they admit\nthe problem that motivates it, namely, the conceptual tension between\nthe nature of music and the nature of the emotions we feel in response\nto it. To elaborate, there is some consensus that emotions are\ncognitive, in the sense that they take intentional objects—they\nare about things—and that the nature of a given\nemotion’s intentional object is constrained. For instance, in\norder to feel fear, one must believe that there is something\nthat is threatening (the “intentional object” of\nthe emotion). When one listens to a sad piece of music, however, one\nknows there is nothing literally feeling an emotion of sadness, and\nthus it is puzzling that one should be made sad by the experience. \nPart of the puzzle can be resolved by acknowledging that not all\nemotional responses (broadly construed) are cognitive (Robinson 1994;\n2005: 387–400). For instance, it is no more puzzling that one\ncould be startled by a fortissimo blow to a bass drum than\nthat one could so respond to a thunderclap. Similarly, we might\nrespond non-cognitively to basic musical elements such as tension and\nrelease just as we do to the tension we observe in a balloon being\nover-inflated, or to the release of doves into the air. \nAs for higher-order emotional responses, there are at least two\npossible explanations. One appeals to the phenomenon of\n“emotional contagion” or “mirroring responses”\n(S. Davies 1994: 279–307; 2006: 186–8). When surrounded by\nmoping people, one tends to become sad. Moreover, such a\n“mood” is not about some intentional object. One\nis not necessarily sad for the mopers, nor whatever they are\nsad about, if anything. Similarly, when “surrounded” by\nmusic that presents an appearance of sadness, one might become sad,\nbut not sad about the music, or anything else (Radford 1991). Jenefer\nRobinson has objected that such contagion is only well documented as a\nform of non-cognitive response, and in response to restricted cues:\n“After all, if living with a basset hound were like living with\na depressed person, would normal folk choose a basset hound as their\nlife’s companion?” (2005: 387–8). But it may be that\nmusic’s dynamic character is enough for it to cross the\nthreshold into the realm of resemblances that elicit mirroring\nresponses from us. \nThe ready-hearability theorist is at a slight advantage in accounting\nfor our emotional responses to music’s expressiveness, since\naccording to that theory one imagines that the music is a\nliteral expression of emotion. This means that emotional responses to\nmusic’s expressiveness are no more puzzling than emotional\nresponses to other imagined expressive agents, such as fictional\ncharacters in novels. The advantage is only slight because the\nquestion of how and why we respond emotionally to fictions is itself a\nphilosophical problem of some magnitude. Nonetheless, there are\nseveral theories available (see entry on\n imagination, section 5.3).\n One difficulty with appealing to a solution to the paradox of fiction\nis that it is not clear that our emotional responses to the\nexpressiveness of music are the same as those to emotionally\nexpressive characters. For instance, the standard example of an\nemotional response to music is being made sad by a funeral march,\nwhile the standard example of emotional response to fiction is\n(something like) to feel pity for a sad character. If the former is to\nbe explained in the same way as the latter, we would expect listeners\nto feel pity in response to the funeral march (pity for the\npersona imagined to be expressing herself through it). However, it\nseems reasonable to ask for more detailed examples since, on the one\nhand, we surely do feel sad (in some sense) in response to tragedy\nand, on the other, it is not obvious that we do not feel pity\n(or imagined pity, or whatever one’s preferred theory of\nemotional response to fiction posits) in response to tragic music. \nLeaving behind the topic of how and why we respond emotionally to pure\nmusic, I turn to the question of why we seek out music that arouses\n“negative” emotions in us, such as sadness, assuming\nhenceforth that we are in fact aroused to such emotions. (Since this\nproblem is a close analog of the “paradox of tragedy”,\nsome of the references below are to literature not explicitly about\nmusic, but the transposition of the arguments to music is not\ndifficult to imagine. See also\n imagination, section 5.4.\n One obvious suggestion is that our negative emotional response is a\nprice we are willing to pay for the benefits of engaging with the\npiece in question, such as “positive” emotional responses.\nWhile this sort of reasoning may play a role, it cannot be a complete\nsolution, since for most pieces that elicit negative responses there\nare many others that elicit fewer or less intense negative responses\nfor the same positive payoff. More sophisticated versions of the same\nsuggestion argue for a more intimate link between the negative\nemotional response and the payoff. One such is that we cannot\nunderstand the work we are engaging with without understanding its\nexpressiveness, which brings the negative response with it (Goodman\n1968: 247–51; S. Davies 1994: 311–20; Goldman 1995: 68;\nRobinson 2005: 348–78). Closely related is the benefit of an\naesthetic or artistic appreciation of the expressiveness responsible\nfor the negative response. \nShifting focus from benefits located in the expressive work to those\nlocated in the emotional listener, the oldest suggestion is\nAristotle’s theory of catharsis, according to which our\nnegative emotional response to negatively expressive art results in a\n(positive) psychological purgation of the negative emotions\n(Poetics, 6, 1449b21–1450b20). A less therapeutic\napproach is the suggestion that, since these emotions are without\n“life implications” (that is, as discussed above, we are\nnot sad about any actual tragic events), we are able to take\nadvantage of our responses to savor these emotions, gain an\nunderstanding of them, and be reassured that we have the capacity to\nfeel them (Levinson 1982). A question that must be answered by any\ndefender of this kind of response is the extent to which it explains,\nfirst, our persistence in seeking out music that elicits negative\nemotional experiences and, second, the enjoyment we seem to take in\nthese negative responses, as opposed to putting up with them for their\nrelated benefits. \nA different kind of solution to the problem argues that responses such\nas sadness that are evoked by expressive music are not really\nnegative. Hume (1757) argues, with respect to tragedy, that the\npleasure we take in the mode of presentation of the content of an\nartwork does not simply counterbalance the negative emotion evoked,\nbut rather subsumes and transforms it into a pleasurable feeling.\nKendall Walton argues (also with respect to tragedy) that sadness is\nnot in itself negative. Rather, it is the situation to which sadness\nis the response that is negative. Thus, though we would not seek out\nthe death of a loved one, given the death we\n“welcome” the sorrow (Walton 1990: 255–9).\nSimilarly, we cannot affect the sadness of a musical work by not\nlistening to it, and so we welcome our sorrowful response to it as\nappropriate. Walton’s approach has the advantage over\nHume’s of not positing a rather obscure psychological process. A\ndifficulty for both, however, is the extent to which they accord with\nour emotional experience in rejecting the characterization of our\nsadness as negative. \nStephen Davies (1994: 316–20) argues that the kinds of solutions\ngiven above construe the problem too narrowly. Though he agrees that\nwe accept the negative responses some music elicits because we are\ninterested in understanding it, he points out that this gives rise to\nthe further question of why we should be so interested in\nunderstanding something that brings us pain. His short answer is\n“We are just like that” (1994: 317) and he begs off giving\nthe long answer, since it seems to be the equivalent of giving an\naccount of human nature or the meaning of life. However, he points out\nthat human life is suffused with activities that people willingly\nengage in despite, or indeed partially because of, the difficulties\nthey bring about. Many things, from watching the news, through\nmountain-climbing, to raising children, are fraught with well-known\ndifficulties, including negative emotional responses. Yet we\nenthusiastically engage in such activities because that is the kind of\ncreature we are. \nFinally, it must be noted that though I have spoken baldly of\n“emotions” above, there is, first, a consensus that we do\nnot respond to music with fully-fledged emotions and, second,\nincreasing sophistication in philosophical theories of emotions.\nRegarding the first point, our emotional responses to music lack many\nof the behaviors characteristic of the supposedly felt emotion. Some\ntake our responses instead to be weaker versions of ordinary emotions\n(Davies 1994: 299–307), others take them to share some aspects\nof ordinary emotions, such as their characteristic affective states,\nbut to lack others, such as a specific intentional object (Levinson\n1982: 319–22; Radford 1989). A third option is that we respond\nto expressive music with “quasi-emotions”, that is, the\naffective components of fully-fledged emotions that we\nimagine to be fully-fledged (Walton 1990: 240–55).\nApart from debate over which of these proposals most closely matches\nour experience, there is the question of how well each of them fits\nwith the various solutions discussed above to the problem of our\nnegative responses to music, and with empirical work on the emotions,\nwhich leads me to the second point: There is growing interest in both\nthe variety of emotions and affective states more broadly, and\nnon-cognitive aspects of, or alternatives to, cognitive theories of\nthe emotions (e.g., Robinson 2005; Bicknell 2007, 2009; Cochrane\n2010a,b; Budd 2011; S. Davies 2011a,b; Young 2014). \nA central topic in the understanding of paradigmatically\nrepresentational art forms, such as literature and film, is what\nconstitutes an acceptable interpretation of a work. One debate\nconcerns whether there is a single correct interpretation of any work\nor multiple acceptable interpretations; another concerns the\nconstraints on acceptable interpretations, e.g., the extent to which\nthe artist’s intentions may or should be taken into account.\nThough these questions seem equally applicable to musical works (S.\nDavies 2002a; Dubiel 2011), most of the literature on understanding\nmusic has focused on the nature of more basic musical understanding,\npresumably because this seems more mysterious than the understanding\nof language or pictures. (The latter are significant philosophical\ntopics in their own right, of course, and it is an interesting\nquestion whether there should similarly be a general theory of music\nas a medium, independent of questions of music’s artistic or\naesthetic use (Kania 2013a).) \nAn additional complication is that two arguably distinct activities go\nby the name of “interpretation” in music: what might be\ncalled performative and critical interpretation\n(Levinson 1993). While a critical interpretation of a musical work\n(often called an analysis) is roughly equivalent to an interpretation\nof a novel, typically expressed linguistically, a performative\ninterpretation is a way of playing or singing the work, typically\nexpressed in a performance of it. It is not easy to clarify the\nrelationship between these two kinds of musical interpretation, but\nsee Levinson 1993, Maus 1999, Thom 2007, and Neufeld 2012. For the\nremainder of this section, I focus on basic musical understanding. \nAnimals can hear music in a sense—your dog might be frightened\nby the loud noise emitted by your stereo. But we do not hear music in\nthis way; we can listen to it with understanding. What\nconstitutes this experience of understanding music? To use an analogy,\nwhile the mere sound of a piece of music might be represented\nby a sonogram, our experience of it as music is better\nrepresented by something like a marked-up score. We hear individual\nnotes that make up distinct melodies, harmonies, rhythms, sections,\nand so on, and the interaction between these elements. Such musical\nunderstanding comes in degrees along a number of dimensions. Your\nunderstanding of a given piece or style may be deeper than mine, while\nthe reverse is true for another piece or style. I may hear more in a\nparticular piece than you do, but my understanding of it may be\ninaccurate. My general musical understanding may be narrow, in the\nsense that I only understand one kind of music, while you understand\nmany different kinds (Budd 1985b: 233–5; S. Davies 2011c:\n88–95). Moreover, different pieces or kinds of pieces may call\non different abilities, since some music has no harmony to speak of,\nsome no melody, and so on. Many argue that, in addition to purely\nmusical features, understanding the emotions expressed in a piece is\nessential to adequately understanding it (e.g., Ridley 1993; S. Davies\n1994; Levinson 1990d: 30; Scruton 1997; Robinson 2005: 348–78).\n(We have seen, in the previous section, the role this claim plays in\nsome explanations of why we seek out music that elicits negative\nemotional responses.) \nThough one must have recourse to technical terms, such as\n“melody”, “dominant seventh”, “sonata\nform”, and so on, in order to describe specific musical\nexperiences and the musical experience in general, it is widely agreed\nthat one need not possess these concepts explicitly, nor the\ncorrelative vocabulary, in order to listen with understanding (Budd\n1985b; 245–8; S. Davies 1994: 346–9; Levinson 1990d:\n35–41; see DeBellis 1995 and Huovinen 2008 for dissenting\nviews). However, it is also widely acknowledged that such explicit\ntheoretical knowledge can aid deeper musical understanding and is\nrequisite for the description and understanding of one’s own\nmusical experience and that of others (Kivy 1990). \nAt the base of the musical experience seem to be (i) the experience of\ntones, as opposed to mere pitched sounds, where a tone is\nheard as being in “musical space”, that is, as bearing\nrelations to other tones such as being higher or lower, or of the same\nkind (at the octave), and (ii) the experience of movement, as\nwhen we hear a melody as wandering far afield and then coming to rest\nwhere it began. Roger Scruton (1983; 1997: 1–96) argues that\nthese experiences are irreducibly metaphorical, since they involve the\napplication of spatial concepts to that which is not literally\nspatial. (There is no identifiable individual that moves from place to\nplace in a melody (S. Davies 1994: 229–34).) Malcolm Budd\n(1985b) argues that to appeal to metaphor in this context is\nunilluminating since, first, it is unclear what it means for an\nexperience to be metaphorical and, second, a metaphor is only\ngiven meaning through its interpretation, which Scruton not only fails\nto give, but argues is unavailable. Budd suggests that the metaphor\nis reducible, and thus eliminable, apparently in terms of\npurely musical (i.e., non-spatial) concepts or vocabulary. Stephen\nDavies (1994: 234–40) doubts that the spatial vocabulary can be\neliminated, but he is sympathetic to Budd’s rejection of the\ncentrality of metaphor. Instead, he argues that our use of spatial and\nmotion terms to describe music is a secondary, but literal, use of\nthose terms that is widely used to describe temporal processes, such\nas the ups and downs of the stock market, the theoretical position one\noccupies, one’s spirits plunging, and so on. The debate\ncontinues in Budd 2003, Scruton 2004, and S. Davies 2011d. \nDavies is surely right about the ubiquity of the application of the\nlanguage of space and motion to processes that lack individuals\nlocated in space. The appeal to secondary literal meanings, however,\ncan seem as unsatisfying as the appeal to irreducible metaphor. We do\nnot hear music simply as a temporal process, it might be objected, but\nas moving in the primary sense of the word, though\nwe know that it does not literally so move. Andrew Kania (2015)\ndevelops a position out of this intuition by emphasizing\nScruton’s appeal to imagination while dropping the appeal to\nmetaphor, arguing that hearing the music as moving is a matter of\nimagining that its constituent sounds move (see also de Clercq 2007\nand Trivedi 2011: 116–18). Kania explicitly models his theory on\nthe popular Waltonian theory of fiction (Walton 1990). Whether this is\na benefit or a cost depends on how similar our basic experiences of\nmusic and fictions are (and, of course, on the truth of Walton’s\ntheory of fiction). \nMoving from basic musical understanding of short passages to that of\ncomplex works of instrumental music, Jerrold Levinson makes a case\nagainst what he sees as the paradigmatic conception of musical\nunderstanding as a matter of the apprehension of form (1997). As a\nreplacement for this “architectonicism”, he promotes\n“concatenationism”: the view that basic musical\nunderstanding consists in following the musical and emotional\nqualities of passages of music, and transitions between them, that are\nshort enough to be apprehended as a single experience\n(“quasi-hearing”). He qualifies this basic idea\nconsiderably, allowing for the experience of previous parts of the\npiece, and anticipation of future parts, to modify one’s\nexperience of the music in the moment. He also allows that\narchitectonic awareness may play a role in enhancing one’s\nmoment-to-moment experience, and may even play an ineliminable part in\nthe understanding of some pieces. Nonetheless, Levinson maintains that\nthe part played by architectonic knowledge in basic musical\nunderstanding is minimal, and that the cases where architectonic\nknowledge is necessary are very much the exception. \nPeter Kivy has taken up the gauntlet on behalf of the\narchitectonicists (2001; see also S. Davies 2011c: 95–9). While\nKivy acknowledges that the kinds of experiences Levinson champions are\nnecessary to basic musical understanding, he defends the idea that\ngrasping the large-scale form of most pieces of Western classical\nmusic, at least, is necessary for an adequate understanding of them.\nHe does not deny that the experience of the form of a piece in\nlistening to it is more intellectual than quasi-hearing, but he\nrejects Levinson’s argument that it is non-perceptual, and thus\nmarginal to an adequate experience of it as music. Rather, Kivy\nargues, such experience is a matter of bringing one’s\nperceptions under sophisticated concepts. (A tactic Kivy does not\nconsider is an attempt to hoist Levinson with his own contextualist\npetard, arguing that even if architectonic listening is non-perceptual\nit is a well-established mode of understanding pieces of music in the\nWestern classical music world, and thus that to argue music must be\nunderstood primarily perceptually is to beg the question.) \nDespite the heated debate that Levinson’s view has generated, it\nis not clear that there is so much disagreement between the\narchitectonicist and the concatenationist. Both agree that the aspect\nof musical understanding the other emphasizes is a non-negligible\ncomponent in the full understanding of a musical work. Levinson has\nbeen explicit since the first publication of his view that he intends\nit more as a polemic against and corrective to architectonicism,\nrather than as a replacement for it (1997: ix–xi; 1999: 485;\n2006a). Perhaps that purpose has now been fulfilled, but see Huovinen\n2013 for a revival of the debate and an attempted synthesis. \n(For more detailed introductions to these and other topics in musical\nunderstanding, see S. Davies 2011c and Huovinen 2011.) \nThere are many disputes about the nature of aesthetic and artistic\nvalue, including even whether these are synonymous terms or distinct\nconcepts. This is not the place to go into those disputes. (For an\nexcellent introduction, see Stecker 2003b.) With regard to the value\nof art in general, there are two central points on which there is some\nconsensus. First, most philosophers take the value of artworks to be\nintrinsic to them, in the sense that the value of a work is tied\nessentially to the experience that the work affords. Thus, artworks\nare not (properly) valued merely instrumentally, as means to some end,\nbut “for” or “in” themselves (Budd 1995:\n1–16; S. Davies 1987: 198–200; Scruton 1997: 374–6;\nLevinson 1992: 15–17). The question that naturally arises next\nis what it is about the experience an artwork affords that makes it\nvaluable. That pleasure is a non-negligible part of the\nanswer to this question is the second point upon which there is some\nconsensus (S. Davies 1987: 198–205; Levinson 1992; Kivy 1997b:\n212–17). However, concomitant with this consensus is an\nacknowledgment that simple pleasure taken, say, in the sensuousness of\nthe musical sounds is too trivial to ground the great value we\nattribute to music. In looking for other sources, the puzzle that\narises is that music is supposed to be an abstract art, par\nexcellence. If this means that music is divorced from everything\nelse that concerns us in the “real world” (that is,\nextra-musical life), it is puzzling why we should find so valuable the\nexperiences musical works afford. Like the questions about musical\nexpressiveness and understanding considered above, this puzzle is most\nevident with respect to “pure” instrumental music, though\nsolutions to it may be applicable to the purely musical aspects of\n“impure” musical works such as songs. \nThere are a couple of dimensions to most solutions of the puzzle of\npure music’s value. One is the extent to which it is agreed that\nmusic really is abstract. To the extent that one thinks that music is\nnot unrelated to the real world, one will be able to argue\nthat music’s value is at least no more puzzling than the value\nof arts more obviously related to the real world, such as literature\nand representational painting and sculpture. (See Ridley 2004 for an\nextended critique of taking the concept of “pure” music as\ncentral to musical aesthetics.) The other dimension to most solutions\nof the puzzle of pure music’s value is the extent to which one\nthinks the abstractness of music is the source of its value. Thus, two\ntheorists might agree on the extent to which music is related to the\nreal world (by being expressive, say), yet one locate its primary\nvalue in that expressiveness while the other locates it in its\nabstract, purely formal features. \nUnsurprisingly, perhaps, those who take the experience of\nmusic’s expressiveness to be a more intimately emotional one\n(through being predicated on imaginative engagement with the music,\nsay), tend to emphasize that experience as more central to musical\nunderstanding, and thus attribute a larger part of music’s value\nto its expressiveness. Those, on the other hand, whose theory of the\nexperience of musical expressiveness is more distanced (a matter of\nnoticed resemblance, say), tend to place less weight on this element\nin their theories of musical value. At one extreme of this spectrum is\nthe position that denies music to be expressive at all, and thus\ncannot attribute music’s value to its expressiveness (most\nnotably Hanslick 1854; see also Zangwill 2004). Apart from this\nextreme position, most theorists agree that music’s value is to\nbe located in different kinds of experience, including the experience\nof formal and expressive features; their disagreements are mostly\nabout the relative weight of these different kinds of experiences in a\ncomplete account of musical value. \nAs with the debate between architectonicists and concatenationists,\ndiscussed above, the extent of the disagreement between various\nparties to this dispute is not clear. Those defending the value of\nmusic’s expressiveness tend to claim that its contribution to\noverall musical value is significant, but many stop short even of\naccording it primary value, and do not argue against the value of\nformal elements of musical works (Ridley 1995: 192–6; Levinson\n1982, 1992: 20–2, 1996a: 124–5; Robinson 2005: 413; Young\n2014: 150–4). They content themselves rather with pointing out\nthe ways in which expressiveness can be valuable. These include many\nof the features discussed above with respect to our interest in\nlistening to music that arouses negative affective states in the\nlistener. To recap, our emotional responses to music’s\nexpressiveness can enable us to savor, understand, and even, to some\nextent, experience emotions in a “safe” way. They can\nprovide us with a cathartic release, and enable us to participate in a\nkind of communication with the composer or communion with other\nmembers of our musical culture (Levinson 1982, 1996a; Higgins 1991,\n2012; S. Davies 1994: 271). Emphasizing this last point, Roger Scruton\nargues that music’s value is quasi-moral, in that the kinds of\nmusic one responds to, or those valued in a particular culture,\nreflect the state of that individual’s or culture’s\n“soul” (1997: 380–91; see also S. Davies 1994:\n275–6.) Stephen Davies (1987: 207–12) has argued that\nthere are beneficial consequences of an interest in music in\ngeneral, such as heightened emotional and aural sensitivity,\nwhich are not properly valued as consequences of listening to\nindividual pieces, but which lead us to value musical culture as a\nwhole (just as we value kindness for its consequences in general,\nwhile rejecting instrumental motivations for kind acts as\ninappropriate). \nOn the other hand, those who defend the value of formal features tend\nto argue that the value of those features is primary, and that the\nvalue of music’s expressiveness is overrated. Peter Kivy, for\ninstance, argues that expressive properties serve merely  \nto highlight musical structure, as color might be used by the painter\nto emphasize contour or mass. Other expressive properties serve as\nstructural properties in their own right. (1990: 196)  \nAlan Goldman (1992) argues against the idea that music is particularly\nsuited to the expression of emotion, claiming that representational\narts such as painting and literature are better at this. Moreover, he\ndisputes the grounds of the value of expressiveness given above. For\nexample, he denies that music can teach us much about the emotions,\nand that we can savor our negative emotional responses to expressive\nmusic. Similarly, after an extensive discussion of the nature of\nmusical expressiveness, Malcolm Budd argues that such expressiveness\ncannot come close to explaining music’s value (1995:\n155–7). He points to the facts that much valuable music is not\nexpressive and that the equal expressiveness of different pieces would\nbe outweighed in a comparative evaluation by the differences between\nthem in terms of formal value. \nBoth Budd and Goldman locate the value of pure music precisely in the\nabstractness that to some seems the greatest obstacle to explaining\nthat value. Budd (1995: 164–71) points out that we have an\nextensive interest in abstract forms outside the realm of music, such\nas those of natural formations and in the decorative arts, and that\nsuch forms are capable of possessing valued aesthetic properties, such\nas beauty, elegance, and so on. Thus, it is no surprise that we value\nhighly the works of an art of abstract forms. Such artworks\ncan exhibit such forms at a level of complexity not found in nature or\nthe decorative arts and, further, can be about their abstract\npatterns, as when the first movement of a piano sonata “says\nsomething about” sonata form. Though these claims may be true,\nand make the case of music less puzzling by showing it shares the\ngrounds of its value with other things, they also leave the primary\npuzzle largely unsolved, namely, why it is that we find the experience\nof abstract forms so valuable. (In Budd’s defense, this puzzle\nis no longer one specific to the philosophy of music.) \nGoldman (1992), by contrast, emphasizes the detachment from the world\nof practical affairs implied by music’s abstractness. The\ncomplexity of great musical works demands the active engagement of our\ncognitive faculties, which we find rewarding, yet not in the pursuit\nof some practical goal that could be frustrated. However, there are\nsome links between music and the “real world” in his\naccount of the value of the musical experience. For one, we value\npieces that lead to a satisfying resolution, particularly if they are\ncolored with negative affect, since this experience is rare in\neveryday life. For another, we feel a particularly close communion\nwith the minds of the composer and other listeners, since we feel we\nare going through an experience just like one they have also had. \nPeter Kivy offers a similar, if less detailed, defense of this\n“liberating” power of music (1997b: 179–217). One\nproblem for Kivy’s account is that he maintains both that our\nexperience of music has “complete freedom from connection with\nour workaday world” (1997b: 209), and that the properties of the\nmusic relevant to our experience include, “most importantly, its\nexpressive properties” (1997b: 205, original emphasis).\nWithout some account of how our interest in the expressive properties\nof a piece does not lead us back to the workaday world (as Kivy\ninsists such properties do in representational arts, such as\nliterature and painting) it seems we should prefer a theory, such as\nBudd’s or Goldman’s, that provides some account of the\nreal-world role our experience of these properties plays. These issues\nare thrown into sharp relief in the debate over how instrumental\nmusical works could be “profound” (Kivy 1990:\n202–18; 2003; S. Davies 2002b; Dodd 2014b). \nThe relationship between musical and ethical values (as opposed to\nmusical examples of more general ethical concerns, such as cultural\nappropriation) is an area ripe for investigation. Extant work includes\nHiggins 1991; Scruton 1997: 457–508; Gracyk 2007: 153–90;\nHagberg 2008; Kivy 2008; Maus 2011; and Levinson 2013b. \n(For introductions to the evaluation of musical works and\nperformances, see S.
