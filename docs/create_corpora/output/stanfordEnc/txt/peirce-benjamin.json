April 4, 1809, d. October 6, 1880) was a professor\nat Harvard with interests in celestial mechanics, applications of plane\nand spherical trigonometry to navigation, number theory and algebra. In\nmechanics, he helped to establish the (effects of the) orbit of Neptune\n(in relation to Uranus). In number theory, he proved that there is no\nodd perfect number with fewer than four distinct prime factors. In\nalgebra, he published a comprehensive book on complex associative\nalgebras. Peirce is also of interest to philosophers because of his\nremarks about the nature and necessity of mathematics. \n\n\n\nBorn in 1809, Peirce became a major figure in mathematics and the\nphysical sciences during a period when the U.S. was still a minor\ncountry in these areas (Hogan 1991). A student at Harvard College, he\nwas appointed tutor there in 1829. Two years later he became Professor\nof Mathematics in the University, a post which was changed in 1842 to\ncover astronomy also; he held it until his death in 1880. He played a\nprominent role in the development of the science curriculum of the\nuniversity, and also acted as College librarian for a time. However, he\nwas not a successful teacher, being impatient with students lacking\nstrong gifts; but he wrote some introductory textbooks in mathematics,\nand also a more advanced one in mechanics (Peirce 1855). Among his\nother appointments, the most important one was Director of the U.S.\nCoast Survey from 1867 to 1874. Peirce also exercised influence through\nhis children. By far the most prominent was\n Charles Sanders Peirce\n (1839–1914), who became a remarkable though maverick polymath,\nas mathematician, chemist, logician, historian, and many other\nactivities. In addition, James Mills (1834–1906) became in turn\nprofessor of mathematics at Harvard, Benjamin Mills (1844–1870)\na mining engineer, and Herbert Henry Davis (1849–1916) a\ndiplomat. Harvard professor Benjamin Osgood Peirce (1854–1914),\nmathematician and physicist was a cousin.  Benjamin Peirce did not\nthink of himself as a philosopher in any academic sense, yet his work\nmanifests interests of this kind, in two different ways. The first was\nrelated to his teaching.  \n\nTo a degree unusually explicit in a mathematician of that time Peirce\naffirmed his Christianity, seeing mathematics as study of God's work by\nGod's creatures. He rarely committed such sentiments to print; but a\nshort passage occurs in the textbook on mechanics previously mentioned,\nwhen considering the idea that the occurrence of perpetual motion in\nnature  \n\nPeirce was more direct in a course of Lowell Lectures on\n‘Ideality in the physical sciences’ delivered at Harvard in\n1879, which James Peirce edited for posthumous publication (Peirce\n1881b). ‘Ideality’ connoted ‘ideal-ism’ as\nevident in certain knowledge, ‘pre-eminently the foundation of\nthe mathematics’. His detailed account concentrated almost\nentirely upon cosmology and cosmogony with some geology (Petersen\n1955). He did not argue for his stance beyond some claims for existence\nby design.  \n\nPeirce was primarily an algebraist in his mathematical style; for\nexample, he was enthusiastic for the cause of quaternions in mechanics\nafter their introduction by W. R. Hamilton in the mid 1840s, and of the\nvarious traditions in mechanics he showed some favour for the\n‘analytical’ approach, where this adjective refers to the\nlinks to algebra. His best remembered publication was a treatment of\n‘linear associative algebras’, that is, all algebras in\nwhich the associative law\nx(yz)=(xy)z was upheld.\n‘Linear’ did not carry the connotation of matrix theory,\nwhich was still being born in others' hands, but referred to the form\nof linear combination, such as:  \n\nin the case of a quaternion q. Peirce wrote an extensive\nsurvey (Peirce 1870), determining the numbers of all algebras with from\ntwo to six elements obeying also various other laws (Walsh 2000, ch.\n2). To two of those he gave names which have become durable:\n‘idempotent’, the law xm =\nx (for m≥2) which George Boole had introduced in\nthis form in his algebra of logic in 1847; and ‘nilpotent’,\nwhen xm = 0, for some m. The\nhistory of the publication of this work is very unusual\n(Grattan-Guinness 1997). Peirce had presented some of his results from\n1867 onwards to the National Academy of Sciences, of which he had been\nappointed a founder member four years earlier; but they could not\nafford to print it. Thus, in an initiative taken by Coast Survey staff,\na lady without mathematical training but possessing a fine hand was\nfound who could both read his ghastly script and write out the entire\ntext 12 pages at a time on lithograph stones. 100 copies were printed\n(Peirce 1870), and distributed world-wide to major mathematicians and\nprofessional colleagues. Eleven years later Charles, then at Johns\nHopkins University, had the lithograph reprinted posthumously, with\nsome additional notes of his own, as a long paper in American journal\nof mathematics, which J.J. Sylvester had recently launched (Peirce\n1881a); it also came out in book form in the next year. This study\nhelped mathematicians to recognise an aspect of the wide variety of\nalgebras which could be examined; it also played a role in the\ndevelopment of model theory in the U.S. in the early 1900s. Enough work\non it had been done by then for a book-length study to be written (Shaw\n1907).  \n\nPeirce seems to have upheld his theological stance for all mathematics,\nand a little sign is evident in the dedication at its head:  \n\nPeirce began with a philosophical statement of a different kind about\nmathematics which has become his best remembered single statement\n“Mathematics is the science that draws necessary conclusions” (Peirce\n1870, p. 1). What does ‘necessary’ denote? Perhaps he was\nfollowing a tradition in algebra, upheld especially by Britons such as\nGeorge Peacock and Augustus De Morgan (a recipient of the lithograph),\nof distinguishing the ‘form’ of an algebra from its\n‘matter’ (that is, an interpretation or application to a\ngiven mathematical and/or physical situation) and claiming that its\nform alone would deliver the consequences from the premises. In his\nfirst draft of his text he wrote the rather more comprehensible\n“Mathematics is the science that draws inferences”, and in the second\ndraft “Mathematics is the science that draws consequences”, though the\nlast word was altered to yield the enigmatic form involving\n‘necessary’ used in the book. The change is not just\nverbal; he must have realised that the earlier forms were not\nsufficient (they are satisfied by other sciences, for example), and so\nadded the crucial adjective. Certainly no whiff of modal logic was in\nhis air. His statement appears in the mathematical literature fairly\noften, but usually without explanation. One feature is clear, but often\nis not stressed. In all versions Peirce always used the active verb\n‘draws’: mathematics was concerned with the act of drawing\nconclusions, not with the theory of so acting, which belonged in\ndisciplines such as logic. He continued:  \n\nIn a lecture of the late 1870s he described his definition as  \n\nThus Peirce maintained the position asserted by Boole that mathematics\ncould be used to analyse logic, not the vice versa relationship between\nthe two disciplines that Gottlob Frege was about to put forward for\narithmetic, and which Bertrand Russell was optimistically to claim for\nall mathematics during the 1900s. Curiously, the third draft\nof the lithograph contains this contrary stance in “Mathematics, as\nhere defined, belongs to every enquiry; it is even a portion of\ndeductive logic, to the laws of which it is rigidly subject”; but by\ncompletion he had changed his mind. Peirce's son Charles claimed to\nhave influenced his father in forming his definitive position, and\nfiercely upheld it himself; thereby he helped to forge a wide division\nbetween the algebraic logic which he was developing from the early\n1870s with his father, Boole and de Morgan as chief formative\ninfluences, and the logicism (as it became called later) of Frege and\nRussell and also the ‘mathematical logic’ of Giuseppe Peano\nand his school in Turin (Grattan-Guinness 1988).
