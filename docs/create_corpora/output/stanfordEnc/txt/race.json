Thus, some\nthinkers categorized humans into only four distinct races (typically\nwhite or Caucasian, Black or African, yellow or Asian, and red or\nNative American), and downplayed any biological or phenotypical\ndistinctions within racial groups (such as those between Scandinavians\nand Spaniards within the white or Caucasian race). Other thinkers\nclassified humans into many more racial categories, for instance\narguing that those humans “indigenous” to Europe could be\ndistinguished into discrete Nordic, Alpine, and Mediterranean\nraces.\n\n\nThe ambiguities and confusion associated with determining the\nboundaries of racial categories have provoked a widespread scholarly\nconsensus that discrete or essentialist races are socially\nconstructed, not biologically real. However, significant scholarly\ndebate persists regarding whether reproductive isolation, either\nduring human evolution or through modern practices barring\nmiscegenation, may have generated sufficient genetic isolation as to\njustify using the term race to signify the existence of non-discrete\nhuman groups that share not only physical phenotypes but also clusters\nof genetic material. In addition, scholarly debate exists concerning\nthe formation and character of socially constructed, discrete racial\ncategories. For instance, some scholars suggest that race is\ninconceivable without racialized social hierarchies, while others\nargue that egalitarian race relations are possible. Finally,\nsubstantial controversy surrounds the moral status of racial identity\nand solidarity and the justice and legitimacy of policies or\ninstitutions aimed at undermining racial inequality.\n\n\nThis entry focuses primarily on contemporary scholarship regarding the\nconceptual, ontological, epistemological, and normative questions\npertaining to race, with an introductory section on the history of the\nconcept of race in the West and in Western philosophy. Aside from some\ndiscussion in Section 5, it does not focus in depth on authors such as\nFrederick Douglass, W.E.B. DuBois, or Frantz Fanon, or movements, such\nas Négritude, Critical Race Theory, Black Identity, Philosophy of\nLiberation, or Feminist Perspectives on Race. Interested readers\nshould consult the relevant entries in the Stanford Encyclopedia of\nPhilosophy for insight into these and other topics important to the\nstudy of race in philosophy.\n\n\nIn Section 1, we trace the historical origins and development of the\nconcept of race. Section 2 covers contemporary philosophical debates\nover whether races actually exist. Thereafter, in Section 3 we examine\nthe differences between race and ethnicity. Section 4 surveys debates\namong moral, political and legal philosophers over the validity of\nracial identity, racial solidarity, and race-specific policies such as\naffirmative action and race-based representation. Section 5 outlines\nengagement with the concept of race within Continental philosophy.\n\nThe dominant scholarly position is that the concept of race is a\nmodern phenomenon, at least in Europe and the Americas. However, there\nis less agreement regarding whether racism, even absent a\ndeveloped race concept, may have existed in the ancient Greek and\nRoman worlds. The influential work of classicist Frank Snowden (1970;\n1983), who emphasized the lack of antiblack prejudice in the ancient\nworld, led many scholars of race to conclude that racism did not exist\nin that epoch. However, later classicists have responded that\nSnowden’s work unnecessarily reduced all forms of racism to its\npeculiarly American version based on skin color and other markers of\nnon-white identity. Benjamin Isaac (2004) and Denise McCoskey (2012)\ncontend that the ancient Greeks and Romans did hold proto-racist views\nthat applied to other groups which today might be considered white.\nIsaac persuasively argues that these views must be\nconsidered proto-racist: although they were formed without\nthe aid of a modern race concept grounded in ideas of deterministic\nbiology (2004, 5), they nevertheless resembled modern racism by\nattributing “to groups of people common characteristics\nconsidered to be unalterable because they are determined by external\nfactors or heredity” (2004, 38). More importantly, both Isaac\nand McCoskey contend that ancient proto-racism influenced the\ndevelopment of modern racism. \nPerhaps the first, unconscious stirrings of the concept of race arose\nwithin the Iberian Peninsula. Following the Moorish conquest of\nAndalusia in the eighth century C.E., the Iberian Peninsula became the\nsite of the greatest intermingling between Jewish, Christian, and\nMuslim believers. During and after\ntheir reconquista (reconquest) of the Muslim principalities\nin the peninsula, the Catholic Monarchs Isabel and Ferdinand sought to\nestablish a uniformly Christian state by expelling first the Jews (in\n1492) and then the Muslims (in 1502). But because large numbers of\nboth groups converted to Christianity to avoid expulsion (and before\nthis to avoid persecution), the monarchs distrusted the authenticity\nof these Jewish and Muslim conversos (converts). To ensure\nthat only truly faithful Christians remained within the realm, the\ngrand inquisitor Torquemada reformulated the Inquisition to inquire\nnot just into defendants’ religious faith and practices but into\ntheir lineage. Only those who could demonstrate their ancestry to\nthose Christians who resisted the Moorish invasion were secure in\ntheir status in the realm. Thus, the idea of purity of blood was born\n(limpieza de sangre), not fully the biological concept of\nrace but perhaps the first occidental use of blood heritage as a\ncategory of religio-political membership (Bernasconi and Lott 2000,\nvii; Hannaford 1996, 122–126; Frederickson 2002,\n31–35). \nThe Iberian Peninsula may also have witnessed the first stirrings of\nantiblack and anti-Native-American racism. Since this region was the\nfirst in Europe to utilize African slavery while gradually rejecting\nthe enslavement of fellow European Christians, Iberian Christians may\nhave come to associate Black people as physically and mentally suitable only\nfor menial labor. In this they were influenced by Arab slave\nmerchants, who assigned the worst tasks to their dark-skinned slaves\nwhile assigning more complex labor to light or tawny-skinned slaves\n(Frederickson 2002, 29). The “discovery” of the New World\nby Iberian explorers also brought European Christians into contact\nwith indigenous Americans for the first time. This resulted in the\nheated debate in Valladolid in 1550 between Bartolomé Las Casas\nand Gines de Sepúlveda over whether the Indians were by nature\ninferior and thus worthy of enslavement and conquest. Whether due to\nLas Casas’ victory over Sepúlveda, or due to the\nhierarchical character of Spanish Catholicism which did not require\nthe dehumanization of other races in order to justify slavery, the\nSpanish empire did avoid the racialization of its conquered peoples\nand African slaves. Indeed, arguably it was the conflict between the\nEnlightenment ideals of universal freedom and equality versus the fact\nof the European enslavement of Africans and indigenous Americans that\nfostered the development of the idea of race (Blum 2002,\n111–112; Hannaford 1996, 149–150). \nWhile events in the Iberian Peninsula may have provided the initial\nstirrings of modern racial sentiments, the concept of race, with its\nclose links to ideas of deterministic biology, emerged with the rise\nof modern natural philosophy and its concern with taxonomy (Smith\n2015). The first important articulation of the race concept came with\nthe 1684 publication of “A New Division of the Earth” by\nFrancois Bernier (1625–1688) (Bernasconi and Lott 2000, viii;\nHannaford 1996, 191, 203). Based on his travels through Egypt, India,\nand Persia, this essay presented a division of humanity into\n“four or five species or races of men in particular whose\ndifference is so remarkable that it may be properly made use of as the\nfoundation for a new division of the earth” (Bernasconi and Lott\n2000, 1–2). First were the peoples inhabiting most of Europe and\nNorth Africa, extending eastward through Persia, northern and central\nIndia, and right up to parts of contemporary Indonesia. Despite their\ndiffering skin tones, these peoples nevertheless shared common\nphysical characteristics, such as hair texture and bone structure. The\nsecond race was constituted by the people of Africa south of the\nSahara Desert, who notably possessed smooth Black skin, thick noses\nand lips, thin beards, and wooly hair. The peoples inhabiting lands\nfrom east Asia, through China, today’s central Asian states such\nas Uzbekistan, and westward into Siberia and eastern Russia\nrepresented the third race, marked by their “truly white”\nskin, broad shoulders, flat faces, flat noses, thin beards, and long,\nthin eyes, while the short and squat Lapps of northern Scandinavia\nconstituted the fourth race. Bernier considered whether the indigenous\npeoples of the Americas were a fifth race, but he ultimately assigned\nthem to the first (Bernasconi and Lott 2000, 2–3). \nBut while Bernier initiated the use of the term “race” to\ndistinguish different groups of humans based on physical traits, his\nfailure to reflect on the relationship between racial division and the\nhuman race in general mitigated the scientific rigor of his definition\n(Bernasconi and Lott 2000, viii). Central to a scientific concept of\nrace would be a resolution of the question of monogenesis versus\npolygenesis. Monogenesis adhered to the Biblical creation story in\nasserting that all humans descended from a common ancestor, perhaps\nAdam of the Book of Genesis; polygenesis, on the other hand, asserted\nthat different human races descended from different ancestral roots.\nThus, the former position contended that all races are nevertheless\nmembers of a common human species, whereas the latter saw races as\ndistinct species. \nDavid Hume’s position on the debate between polygenesis versus\nmonogenesis is the subject of some scholarly debate. The bone of\ncontention is his essay “Of National Characters,” where he\ncontends that differences among European nations are attributable not\nto natural differences but to cultural and political influences.\nAmidst this argument against crude naturalism, Hume inserts a footnote\nin the 1754 edition, wherein he writes: “I am apt to\nsuspect the negroes and in general all the other species of men\n(for there are four or five different kinds) to be naturally\ninferior to whites. There never was a civilized nation of\nany other complexion than white, nor even any individual eminent\neither in action or speculation” (Zack 2002, 15; emphasis\nadded). Whereas even the most barbarous white nations such as the\nGermans “have something eminent about them,” the\n“uniform and constant difference” in accomplishment\nbetween whites and non-whites could not occur “if nature had not\nmade an original distinction betwixt these breeds of men” (Zack\n2002, 15). Responding to criticism, he softens this position in the\n1776 edition, restricting his claims to natural inferiority only to\n“negroes,” stating that “scarcely ever was\na civilized nation of that complexion, not even of individual eminent\nin action or speculation” (Zack 2002, 17; Hume 1776 [1987], 208;\nemphasis added). Richard Popkin (1977) and Naomi Zack (2002,\n13–18) contend that the 1754 version of the essay assumes,\nwithout demonstration, an original, polygenetic difference between\nwhite and non-white races. Andrew Valls (2005, 132) denies that either\nversion of the footnote espouses polygenesis. \nA strong and clear defense of monogenesis was provided by Immanuel\nKant (1724–1804) in his essay “Of the Different Human\nRaces,” first published in 1775 and revised in 1777. Kant argued\nthat all humans descend from a common human “lineal root\ngenus” in Europe, which contained the biological\n“seeds” and “dispositions” that can generate\nthe distinct physical traits of race when triggered by divergent\nenvironmental factors, especially combinations of heat and humidity.\nThis, combined with patterns of migration, geographic isolation, and\nin-breeding, led to the differentiation of four distinct, pure races:\nthe “noble blond” of northern Europe; the “copper\nred” of America (and east Asia); the “black” of\nSenegambia in Africa; and the “olive-yellow” of\nAsian-India. Once these discrete racial groups were developed over\nmany generations, further climatic changes will not alter racial\nphenotypes (Bernasconi and Lott 2000, 8–22). \nYet despite the distinction generated between different races,\nKant’s monogenetic account led him to maintain that the different\nraces were part of a common human species. As evidence, he adduced the\nfact that individuals from different races were able to breed\ntogether, and their offspring tended to exhibit blended physical\ntraits inherited from both parents. Not only did blending indicate\nthat the parents were part of a common species; it also indicated that\nthey are of distinct races. For the physical traits of parents of the\nsame race are not blended but often passed on exclusively: a blond\nwhite man and a brunette white woman may have four blond children,\nwithout any blending of this physical trait; whereas a Black man and a\nwhite woman will bear children who blend white and Black traits\n(Bernasconi and Lott 2000, 9–10). Such inter-racial mixtures\naccounted for the existence of liminal individuals, whose physical\ntraits seem to lie between the discrete boundaries of one of the four\nraces; peoples who do not fit neatly into one or another race are\nexplained away as groups whose seeds have not been fully triggered by\nthe appropriate environmental stimuli (Bernasconi and Lott 2000,\n11). \nThe “science” of race was furthered by the man sometimes\nconsidered to be the father of modern anthropology, Johann Friedrich\nBlumenbach (1752–1840). In his doctoral dissertation, “On\nthe Natural Variety of Mankind,” first published in 1775,\nBlumenbach identified four “varieties” of mankind: the\npeoples of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. His essay was revised\nand republished both in 1781, wherein he introduced a fifth variety of\nmankind, that inhabiting the South Pacific islands, and in 1795,\nwherein he first coined the term “Caucasian” to describe\nthe variety of people inhabiting Europe, West Asia, and Northern\nIndia. This term reflected his claim that this variety originated in\nthe Caucuses mountains, in Georgia, justifying this etiology through\nreference to the superior beauty of the Georgians. The 1795 version\nalso included the terms Mongolian to describe the non-Caucasian\npeoples of Asia, Ethiopian to signify Black Africans, American to\ndenote the indigenous peoples of the New World, and Malay to identify\nthe South Pacific Islanders (Bernasconi and Lott 2000, 27–33;\nHannaford 1996, 207). \nWhile noting differences in skin tone, he based his varieties upon the\nstructures of the cranium, which supposedly gave his distinctions a\nstronger scientific foundation than the more superficial\ncharacteristic of color (Hannaford 1996, 206). In addition, he\nstrongly denied polygenetic accounts of racial difference, noting the\nability of members of different varieties to breed with each other,\nsomething that humans were incapable of doing with other species.\nIndeed, he took great pains to dismiss as spurious accounts of\nAfricans mating with apes or of monstrous creatures formed through the\nunion of humans with other animals (Hannaford 1996, 208–209). In\nfinal support of his more scientific, monogenist approach, Blumenbach\nposited the internal, biological force which generated racial\ndifference, the “nisus formativus,” which when triggered\nby specific environmental stimuli generated the variations found\nwithin the varieties of humans (Hannaford 1996, 212). \nDespite the strong monogenist arguments provided by Kant and\nBlumenbach, polygenesis remained a viable intellectual strain within\nrace theory, particularly in the “American School of\nAnthropology,” embodied by Louis Agassiz, Robins Gliddon, and\nJosiah Clark Nott. Agassiz was born in Switzerland, received an M.D.\nin Munich and later studied zoology, geology, and paleontology in\nvarious German universities under the influence of Romantic scientific\ntheories. His orthodox Christian background initially imbued him with\na strong monogenist commitment, but upon visiting America and seeing\nan African American for the first time, Agassiz experienced a type of\nconversion experience, which led him to question whether these\nremarkably different people could share the same blood as Europeans.\nEventually staying on and making his career in America, and\ncontinually struck by the physical character of African Americans,\nAgassiz officially announced his turn to polygenesis at the 1850\nmeeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science\n(AAAS) in Charleston, South Carolina. Nott, a South Carolina\nphysician, attended the same AAAS meeting and, along with Gliddon,\njoined Agassiz in the promulgation of the American School’s\ndefense of polygenesis (Brace 2005, 93–103). \nAlong with Agassiz, Nott was also influenced by the French romantic\nrace theorist Arthur de Gobineau (1816–1882), whose “Essay\non the Inequality of the Human Races” (1853–1855) Nott\npartially translated into English and published for the American\naudience. Although the Catholic Gobineau initially espoused\nmonogenesis, he later leaned towards polygenesis and ended up\nambivalent on this issue (Hannaford 1996, 268–269).\nNevertheless, Gobineau lent credence to the white racial supremacy\nthat Nott supported (Brace 2005, 120–121). Gobineau posited two\nimpulses among humans, that of attraction and repulsion. Civilization\nemerges when humans obey the law of attraction and intermingle with\npeoples of different racial stocks. According the Gobineau, the white\nrace was created through such intermingling, which allowed it alone to\ngenerate civilization, unlike the other races, which were governed\nonly by the law of repulsion. Once civilization is established,\nhowever, further race mixing leads to the degeneration of the race\nthrough a decline in the quality of its blood. Consequently, when the\nwhite race conquers other Black or yellow races, any further\nintermingling will lead it to decline. Thus, Gobineau claimed that the\nwhite race would never die so long as its blood remains composed of\nits initial mixture of peoples. Notably, Nott strategically excised\nthose sections discussing the law of attraction when translating\nGobineau’s essay for an American audience (Bernasconi and Lott\n2000, 45–51). \nEventually, polygenesis declined through the intellectual success of\nCharles Darwin’s theory of evolution (Brace 2005, 124). Darwin\nhimself weighed in on this debate in the chapter “On the Races\nof Man” in his book The Descent of Man (1871),\narguing that as the theory of evolution gains wider acceptance,\n“the dispute between the monogenists and the polygenists will\ndie a silent and unobserved death” (Bernasconi and Lott 2000,\n68), with the former winning out. The rest of the essay entertained\nboth sides of the debate regarding whether or not different races\nconstitute different species or sub-species of humans. Although Darwin\ndid not explicitly take sides in this debate, the preponderance of his\nargument gives little support to the idea of races being different\nspecies. For instance, he noted that couples from different races\nproduce fertile offspring, and that individuals from different races\nseem to share many mental similarities. That said, while Darwinian\nevolution may have killed off polygenesis and the related idea that\nthe races constituted distinct species, it hardly killed off race\nitself. Darwin himself did not think natural selection would by itself\ngenerate racial distinctions, since the physical traits associated\nwith racial differences did not seem sufficiently beneficial to favor\ntheir retention; he did, however, leave open a role for sexual\nselection in the creation of races, through repeated mating among\nindividuals with similar traits (Bernasconi and Lott 2000,\n77–78). Consequently, later race thinkers would replace\npolygenesis with natural selection and sexual selection as scientific\nmechanisms whereby racial differentiation could slowly,\nunintentionally, but nevertheless inevitably proceed (Hannaford 1996,\n273). \nSexual selection became a central focus for race-thinking with the\nintroduction of the term “eugenics” in 1883 by Francis\nGalton (1822–1911) in his essay “Inquiries into Human\nFaculty and Development” (Hannaford 1996, 290). Focusing on\nphysical as opposed to “moral” qualities, Galton advocated\nselective breeding to improve the “health, energy, ability,\nmanliness, and courteous disposition” of the human species in\nhis later essay “Eugenics: Its Definition, Scope, and\nAims” (Bernasconi and Lott 2000, 80). Following the same\ncurrents of “Social Darwinism” that advocated the\nevolutionary improvement of the human condition through active human\nintervention, Galton proposed making eugenics not only an element in\npopular culture or “a new religion” (Bernasconi and Lott\n2000, 82) but even a policy enforced by the American government. While\npositive eugenics, or the enforced breeding of higher types, never\nbecame law, negative eugenics, or the sterilization of the\nfeebleminded or infirm, did become public policy enforced by a number\nof American states and upheld by the United States Supreme Court in an\neight-to-one decision in Buck v. Bell (274 U.S. 200, 1927).\nThe widespread acceptance of negative eugenics can be inferred by the\nfact that the Court Opinion justifying the decision was authored by\nJustice Oliver Wendell Holmes, a figure usually associated with\nprogressive and civil libertarian positions, and whose doctrine of\n“clear and present danger” sought to expand the protection\nof free speech. \nThe apogee of post-Darwinian race-thinking was arguably reached in the\nbook The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century by Houston\nStewart Chamberlain (1855–1927), the son-in-law of German opera\ncomposer Richard Wagner. Chamberlain argued in the evolutionary terms\nof sexual selection that distinct races emerged through geographical\nand historical conditions which create inbreeding among certain\nindividuals with similar traits (Hannaford 1996, 351). Moving from\nthis initial specification, Chamberlain then argued that the key\nstrands of western civilization—Christianity and ancient Greek\nphilosophy and art—emerged from the Aryan race. Jesus, for\ninstance, was held to be of Aryan stock, despite his Jewish religion,\nsince the territory of Galilee was populated by peoples descended from\nAryan Phonecians as well as by Semitic Jews. Similarly,\nAristotle’s distinction between Greeks and Barbarians was\nreinterpreted as a racial distinction between Aryans and non-Aryans.\nThese Greek and Christian strands became united in Europe,\nparticularly during the Reformation, which allowed the highest,\nTeutonic strain of the Aryan race to be freed from constraining Roman\nCatholic cultural fetters. But while Roman institutions and practices\nmay have constrained the Teutonic Germans, their diametric opposite\nwas the Jew, the highest manifestation of the Semitic Race. The\nEuropean religious tensions between Christian and Jew were thus\ntransformed into racial conflicts, for which conversion or ecumenical\ntolerance would have no healing effect. Chamberlain’s writings,\nnot surprisingly, have come to be seen as some of the key intellectual\nfoundations for twentieth century German anti-Semitism, of which Adolf\nHitler was simply its most extreme manifestation. \nIf Chamberlain’s writings served as intellectual fodder for\nGerman racial prejudice, Madison Grant (1865–1937) provided\nsimilar foundations for American race prejudice against Black people and\nNative Americans in his popular book The Passing of the Great\nRace (1916). Rejecting political or educational means of\nameliorating the destitution of the subordinate racial groups in\nAmerica, Grant instead advocated strict segregation and the\nprohibition of miscegenation, or the interbreeding of members of\ndifferent races (Hannaford 1996, 358). Like Galton, Grant had similar\nsuccess in influencing American public policy, both through the\nimposition of racist restrictions on immigration at the federal level\nand through the enforcement of anti-miscegenation laws in thirty\nstates, until such prohibitions were finally overturned by the United\nStates Supreme Court in Loving v. Virginia (388 U.S. 1\n[1967]). \nIf the apogee of biological race was reached in the early twentieth\ncentury, its decline began at about the same time. While writers such\nas Chamberlain and Grant popularized and politicized biological\nconceptions of race hierarchy, academic anthropologists since\nBlumenbach gave the concept of race its scientific validity. But\nacademic anthropology also provided the first challenge to biological\nrace in the person of Columbia University professor Franz Boas\n(1858–1942), a German-born Jewish immigrant to the United\nStates. Boas challenged the fixed character of racial groups by taking\non one of the key fundaments to racial typology, cranium size. Boas\nshowed that this characteristic was profoundly affected by\nenvironmental factors, noting that American-born members of various\n“racial” types, such as Semitic Jews, tended to have\nlarger crania than their European-born parents, a result of\ndifferences in nourishment. From this he concluded that claims about\nracially differential mental capacities could similarly be reduced to\nsuch environmental factors. In so doing, Boas undermined one measure\nof racial distinction, and although he did not go so far as to reject\nentirely the concept of biological race itself, he strongly influenced\nanthropologists to shift their focus from putatively fixed biological\ncharacteristics to apparently mutable cultural factors in order to\nunderstand differences among human groups (Bernasconi and Lott 2000,\n84–88; Brace 2005, 167–169; Cornell and Hartmann 1998,\n42–43). \nA stronger anthropological rejection of the biological conception of\nrace was leveled by Ashley Montagu (1905–1999). Drawing on\ninsights from modern, experimental genetics, Montagu forcefully argued\nthat the anthropological conception of race relied on grouping\ntogether various perceptible physical characteristics, whereas the\nreal building blocks of evolution were genes, which dictated\nbiological changes among populations at a much finer level. The\nmorphological traits associated with race, thus, were gross aggregates\nof a variety of genetic changes, some of which resulted in physically\nperceptible characteristics, many others of which resulted in\nimperceptible changes. Moreover, since genetic evolution can occur\nthrough both the mixture of different genes and the mutation of the\nsame gene over generations, the traits associated with races cannot be\nattributed to discrete lines of genetic descent, since the dark skin\nand curly hair of one individual may result from genetic mixture while\nthe same traits in another individual may result from genetic mutation\n(Bernasconi and Lott 2000, 100–107). Montagu’s efforts\neventually resulted in the publication of an official statement\ndenying the biological foundations of race by the United Nations\nEducational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1950,\nalthough it would take until 1996 for the American Association of\nPhysical Anthropologists (AAPA) to publish a similar document (Brace\n2005, 239). \nRon Mallon (2004, 2006, 2007) provides a nice sketch of the\ncontemporary philosophical terrain regarding the status of the concept\nof race, dividing it into three valid competing schools of thought\nregarding the ontological status of race, along with the discarded\nbiological conception. Racial naturalism signifies the old,\nbiological conception of race, which depicts races as bearing\n“biobehavioral essences: underlying natural (and perhaps\ngenetic) properties that (1) are heritable, biological features, (2)\nare shared by all and only the members of a race, and (3) explain\nbehavioral, characterological, and cultural predispositions of\nindividual persons and racial groups” (2006, 528–529).\nWhile philosophers and scientists have reached the consensus against\nracial naturalism, philosophers nevertheless disagree on the possible\nontological status of a different conception of race. Mallon divides\nsuch disagreements into three metaphysical camps (racial\nskepticism, racial constructivism, and racial\npopulation naturalism) and two normative camps\n(eliminativism and conservationism). We have used\n‘constructivism’ throughout for the sake of consistency\nbut it should be read as interchangeable with\n‘constructionism.’ \nRacial skepticism holds that because racial naturalism is\nfalse, races of any type do not exist. Racial skeptics, such as\nAnthony Appiah (1995, 1996) and Naomi Zack (1993, 2002) contend that\nthe term race cannot refer to anything real in the world, since the\none thing in the world to which the term could uniquely\nrefer—discrete, essentialist, biological races—have been\nproven not to exist. Zack (2002, 87–88) provides an accessible\nsummary of the racial skeptic’s argument against the biological\nfoundations for race, sequentially summarizing the scientific\nrejection of essences, geography, phenotypes, post-Mendelian\ntransmission genetics, and genealogies as possible foundations for\nraces. Aristotelian essences, thought to ground the common\ncharacteristics of distinct species, were correctly rejected by early\nmodern philosophers. If essences cannot even ground differences among\nspecies, then they clearly cannot ground the differences among races,\nwhich even nineteenth century racial science still understood as\nmembers of the same species. Whereas folk theories rely\non geography to divide humanity into African, European,\nAsian, and Amerindian races, contemporary population genetics reveal\nthe vacuity of this foundation for two reasons. First, geographically\nbased environmental stimuli lead to continuous physical adaptations in\nskin, hair and bone rather than the discrete differences associated\nwith race; and second, although mitochondrial DNA mutations provide\nevidence of the geographical origins of populations, these mutations\ndo not correlate with the physical traits associated with racial\ngroups. Similarly, phenotypes cannot ground folk theories\nof race: for instance, differences in skin tone are gradual, not\ndiscrete; and blood-type variations occur independently of the more\nvisible phenotypes associated with race, such as skin color and hair\ntexture. Race cannot be founded upon transmission genetics,\nsince the genes transmitted from one generation to the next lead to\nvery specific physical traits, not general racial characteristics\nshared by all members of a putatively racial group. And\nfinally, genealogy cannot ground race, since clades\n(populations descended from a common ancestor) may have common genetic\ncharacteristics, but these need not correlate with the visible traits\nassociated with races. Zack concludes: “Essences, geography,\nphenotypes, genotypes, and genealogy are the only known candidates for\nphysical scientific bases of race. Each fails. Therefore, there is no\nphysical scientific basis for the social racial taxonomy” (Zack\n2002, 88). \nRacial skeptics like Appiah and Zack adopt normative\nracial eliminativism, which recommends discarding the\nconcept of race entirely, according to the following argument. Because\nof its historical genealogy, the term race can only refer to one or\nmore discrete groups of people who alone share biologically\nsignificant genetic features. Such a monopoly on certain genetic\nfeatures could only emerge within a group that practices such a high\nlevel of inbreeding that it is effectively genetically isolated. Such\ngenetic isolation might refer to the Amish in America (Appiah 1996,\n73) or to Irish Protestants (Zack 2002, 69), but they clearly cannot\nrefer to those groupings of people presently subsumed under American\nracial census categories. Because the concept “race” can\nonly apply to groups not typically deemed races (Amish, Irish\nProtestants), and because this concept cannot apply to groups\ntypically deemed races (African Americans, Whites, Asians, Native\nAmericans), a mismatch occurs between the concept and its typical\nreferent. Thus, the concept of race must be eliminated due to its\nlogical incoherence (Mallon 2006, 526, 533). \nAppiah has since modified his skepticism in such a way that softens\nthe eliminitivist element of his position. Appiah has come to argue\nfor racial nominalism by admitting the importance of\n“human folk races,” namely, that they are forms of social\nidentity that do in fact exist (2006, 367). The way in which they are\nsocial identities, however, is a problem because we treat them as if\nthere were some biological underpinning to them (2006, 367). The folk\ntheory of race, then, is false because it is based on mistaken\nbeliefs, yet it is nonetheless true that we continue to categorize\npeople along its lines. Appiah’s nominalist view of race aims to\nreveal how these social identities work by analyzing the labels we use\nfor them. According to Appiah there are three ways that we categorize\nusing folk racial labels: ascription, identification, and treatment,\nand it takes all three for a given label to be a functioning social\nidentity (2006, 368–370). As a result, we come to live as these\nidentities and look to them as a central resource for constructing our\nlives. Furthermore, norms of identification and authenticity arise\naround them (2006, 372). Since there is no biological story that can\nbe told to ground these labels then race is not real (2006, 372). For\na critique of Appiah’s modified view that focuses on Appiah\n(1996) see Ronald R. Sundstrom (2002). \nRacial constructivism refers to the argument that, even if\nbiological race is false, races have come into existence and continue\nto exist through “human culture and human decisions”\n(Mallon 2007, 94). Race constructivists accept the skeptics’\ndismissal of biological race but argue that the term still\nmeaningfully refers to the widespread grouping of individuals into\ncertain categories by society, indeed often by the very members of\nsuch racial ascriptions. Normatively, race constructivists argue that\nsince society labels people according to racial categories, and since\nsuch labeling often leads to race-based differences in resources,\nopportunities, and well-being, the concept of race must be conserved,\nin order to facilitate race-based social movements or policies, such\nas affirmative action, that compensate for socially constructed but\nsocially relevant racial differences. While sharing this normative\ncommitment to race conservationism, racial constructivists\ncan be subdivided into three groups with slightly different accounts\nof the ontology of race. As we will see below, however, Sally\nHaslanger’s eliminitivist constructivism illustrates how these\ncommitments can come apart. \nThin constructivism depicts race as a grouping of humans\naccording to ancestry and genetically insignificant,\n“superficial properties that are prototypically linked with\nrace,” such as skin tone, hair color and hair texture (Mallon\n2006, 534). In this way, thin constructivists such as Robert\nGooding-Williams (1998), Lucius Outlaw (1990, 1996) and Charles Mills\n(1998) rely on the widespread folk theory of race while rejecting its\nscientific foundation upon racial naturalism. Interactive kind\nconstructivism goes further, in arguing that being ascribed to a\ncertain racial category causes the individuals so labeled to have\ncertain common experiences (Mallon 2006, 535; Piper 1992). For\ninstance, if society ascribes you as black, you are likely to\nexperience difficulty hailing cabs in New York or are more likely to\nbe apprehended without cause by the police (James 2004, 17).\nFinally, institutional constructivism emphasizes race as a\nsocial institution, whose character is specific to the society in\nwhich it is embedded and thus cannot be applied across cultures or\nhistorical epochs (Mallon 2006, 536). Michael Root (2000, 632) notes\nthat a person ascribed as Black in the United States would likely not\nbe considered Black in Brazil, since each country has very different\nsocial institutions regarding the division of humanity into distinct\nraces. Similarly, Paul Taylor (2000) responds to Appiah’s racial\nskepticism by holding that races, even if biologically unreal, remain\nreal social objects (Mallon 2006, 536–537). Indeed, in a later\nwork Taylor (2004) argues that the term “race” has a\nperfectly clear referent, that being those people socially ascribed to\ncertain racial categories within the United States, regardless of the\nwidespread social rejection of biological racial naturalism. \nSally Haslanger’s constructivism (2000, 2010, 2019) is not,\nhowever, conservationist. She understands races as racialized groups,\nwhose membership requires three criteria. One, members are those who\nare “observed or imagined” to have certain bodily features\nthat are evidence of certain ancestry from certain geographical\nlocations; two, “having (or being imagined to have)” those\nfeatures marks members as occupying either a subordinate or privileged\nsocial position, thereby justifying that position; and three, the\nsatisfaction of the first two criteria plays a role in members’\nsystemic subordination or privilege (2019, 25–26). Racial\nidentity in such contexts need not focus exclusively on subordination\nor privilege, as “many forms of racial identity are important,\nvaluable, and in some cases even inevitable responses to racial\nhierarchy” (2019, 29–30). She worries, however, that even\nthough we should embrace “cultural groups marked by ancestry and\nappearance” in the short term to fight for justice, she worries\nabout embracing them for the long term (2019, 30). \nConstructivism also cleaves along political and cultural dimensions, a\ndistinction owed to Chike Jeffers (Jeffers, 2013, 2019).\nHaslanger’s view is paradigmatic of political constructivism by\nunderstanding the meaning of race as determined by hierarchical\nrelations of power by definition: “race is made real\nwholly or most importantly by hierarchical relations of power”\n(Jeffers 2019, 48). Jeffers’ cultural constructivism corrects for\npolitical constructivism’s inability to account for race\nexisting after racism, including the idea of racial equality (2013,\n421; 2019, 71). Cultural constructivism rejects “the idea that\ncultural difference is less important than differences in power\nrelations for understanding racial phenomena in the present”\n(2019, 65). At the extreme, political constructivism argues for, one,\ndifferential power relations bring racial difference into existence;\ntwo, differential power relations are fundamental for understanding\nthe present reality of race; and three, differential power relations\nare essential to race, so race will cease to exist in an egalitarian\nsociety where appearance and ancestry do not correlate to certain\nhierarchical positions (2019, 56–57). Jeffers concedes\nrace’s political origin while rejecting the two other ways that\npower relations define race (2013, 419; 2019, 57–58). The\ncultural significance of race can be seen in three ways. First, even\nthe emergence of racial categories counts as a cultural shift, insofar\nas new social contexts are created in which those viewed as being of\ndifferent races are also viewed as having different cultures. Second,\nthere are “novel forms of cultural difference” that emerge\nin the wake of racial difference. And third, racial groups are shaped\nculturally by happenings prior to racial formation (2019,\n62–63). Jeffers thus writes of Blackness, “What it means\nto be a Black person, for many of us, including myself, can never be\nexhausted through reference to problems of stigmatization,\ndiscrimination, marginalization, and disadvantage, as real and as\nlarge-looming as these factors are in the racial landscape as we know\nit. There is also joy in blackness, a joy shaped by culturally\ndistinctive situations” (2013, 422). \nThere are also views that challenge the broad strokes of\nconstructivism while avoiding racial skepticism: Lionel K.\nMcPherson’s deflationary pluralism (2015), Joshua\nGlasgow’s basic racial realism (2015, with Jonathan M. Woodward,\n2019), and Michael O. Hardimon’s deflationary realism (2003,\n2014, 2017). McPherson argues that “race” should be\nreplaced with his concept of socioancestry, since\n“‘race’ talk overall is too ambiguous and contested\nto be salvaged in the search for a dominant understanding”\n(2015, 676). He aims to sidestep Appiah’s eliminativism by\nclaiming that deflationary pluralism “does not maintain that\n‘race’ talk is necessarily an error and does not take a\nhard line about whether races exist” (2015, 675). Socioancestry\nretains the possibility of “color-conscious social identity”\nwithout the burdens of assumptions or confusions about race and racial\nnature (2015, 686). This is because it is “visible continental\nancestry,” rather than race, which is the root of\ncolor-consciousness (2015, 690). Socioancestry, then, focuses on\nvisible continental ancestry alone to explain social group formation.\nAccordingly, socioancestral identities develop “when persons\naccept (or are ascribed) a social identity because they share a\ncomponent of continental ancestry that distinctively shapes\ncolor-conscious social reality” (2015, 690). \nGlasgow’s basic racial realism aims to capture our operative\nmeaning of race: “the meaning that governs our use of the term,\neven when we are unaware of it” (2019, 115). Glasgow defines his\nposition in the following way: “Races, by definition, are\nrelatively large groups of people who are distinguished from other\ngroups of people by having certain visible biological traits (such as\nskin color) to a disproportionate extent.” The position is\ntherefore anti-realist, since it claims that races are neither\nbiologically nor socially real (2019, 117). Glasgow’s position\nis grounded in judgments about our commitments, believing that we are\nmore willing to give up on the biological basis for race than we are\nto give up on the idea that there are certain “core features and\nidentities” connected to the idea of race” (2019, 127). In\nother words, disbelieving in the biological reality of race doesn’t\nlead to eliminativism. Glasgow holds, however, that it also doesn’t\nlead to social constructivism. Race is not socially made because,\n“no matter which social facts we attend to, we can always\nimagine them disappearing while race stays. And if race is\nconceptually able to persist across all social practices, then by\ndefinition it is not a social phenomenon” (2019, 133). This\nintuition is based in his focus on our ordinary usage of the term\n“race,” which is fully captured by visible traits. \nHardimon’s deflationary realism argues that we need four\ninterrelated race concepts to coherently answer the question of what\nrace is to human beings: the racialist concept of race, the minimalist\nconcept of race, the populationist concept of race, and the concept of\nsocialrace (2017, 2–3, 7). The racialist concept of race is the\nview that there are fixed patterns of race-based moral, intellectual,\nand cultural characteristics that are heritable, based in an\nunderlying biological essence, correlate to physical characteristics,\nand form a distinct racial hierarchy (2017, 15–16). Minimalist\nrace “says that people differ in shape and color in ways that\ncorrespond to differences in their geographical ancestry. Essentially\nthat is all it says” (2017, 6; see also 2003). It aims to\ncapture in “a nonmalefic way” what the racialist concept\nof race says that it captures. In other words, it admits of the\nnonsocial and biological reality of race but in a value-neutral way\n(2017, 7). Populationist race aims to do the same thing in a more\nrobust and specific way by giving a genetic underpinning to the\nminimalist conception based on a “geographically separated and\nreproductively isolated founding population” (2017, 99). This\nconcept is distinguished from cladistic race because it does not\nrequire monophyly (2017, 110). Finally, socialrace captures race in\nterms of its social relations and practices. It refers to “the\nsocial groups in racist societies that appear to be racialist races as\nsocial groups that falsely appear to be biological groups”\n(2017, 10; see also 2014). Hardimon argues that it is only through\nusing all four concepts, with the rejection of the first being the\nbasis for the construction of the latter three, that we can actually\nunderstand our concept of race. \nThe third school of thought regarding the ontology of race\nis racial population naturalism. This camp suggests that,\nalthough racial naturalism falsely attributed cultural, mental, and\nphysical characters to discrete racial groups, it is possible that\ngenetically significant biological groupings could exist that would\nmerit the term races. Importantly, these biological racial groupings\nwould not be essentialist or discrete: there is no set of genetic or\nother biological traits that all and only all members of a racial\ngroup share that would then provide a natural biological boundary\nbetween racial groups. Thus, these thinkers confirm the strong\nscientific consensus that discrete, essentialist races do not exist.\nHowever, the criteria of discreteness and essentialism would also\ninvalidate distinctions between non-human species, such as lions and\ntigers. As Philip Kitcher puts it, “there is no…genetic\nfeature…that separates one species of mosquito or mushroom from\nanother” (Kitcher 2007, 294–296; Cf. Mallon 2007,\n146–168). Rather, biological species are differentiated by\nreproductive isolation, which is relative, not absolute (since hybrids\nsometimes appear in nature); which may have non-genetic causes (e.g.,\ngeographic separation and incompatible reproduction periods or\nrituals); which may generate statistically significant if not uniform\ngenetic differences; and which may express distinct phenotypes. In\neffect, if the failure to satisfy the condition of discreteness and\nessentialism requires jettisoning the concept of race, then it also\nrequires jettisoning the concept of biological species. But because\nthe biological species concept remains epistemologically useful, some\nbiologists and philosophers use it to defend a racial ontology that is\n“biologically informed but non-essentialist,” one that is\nvague, non-discrete, and related to genetics, genealogy, geography,\nand phenotype (Sesardic 2010, 146). \nThere are three versions of racial population naturalism: cladistic\nrace; socially isolated race; and genetically clustered\nrace. Cladistic races are “ancestor-descendant\nsequences of breeding populations that share a common origin”\n(Andreasen 2004, 425). They emerged during human evolution, as\ndifferent groups of humans became geographically isolated from each\nother, and may be dying out, if they have not already, due to more\nrecent human reproductive intermingling (Andreasen 1998,\n214–216; Cf. Andreasen 2000, S653–S666). Socially\nisolated race refers to the fact that legal sanctions against\nmiscegenation might have created a genetically isolated African\nAmerican race in the USA (Kitcher 1999). Finally, defenders\nof genetically clustered race argue that although only 7%\nof the differences between any two individuals regarding any one\nspecific gene can be attributed to their membership in one of the\ncommonly recognized racial categories, the aggregation of several\ngenes is statistically related to a small number of racial categories\nassociated with major geographic regions and phenotypes (Sesardic\n2010; Kitcher 2007, 304). \nThe question is whether these new biological ontologies of race avoid\nthe conceptual mismatches that ground eliminativism. The short answer\nis that they can, but only through human intervention. Socially\nisolated race faces no mismatch when applied to African Americans,\ndefined as the descendants of African slaves brought to the United\nStates. However, this racial category would not encompass Black\nAfricans. Moreover, because African American race originated in\nlegally enforced sexual segregation, it is “both biologically\nreal and socially constructed” (Kitcher 2007, 298). Genetic\nclustering would seem to provide an objective, biological foundation\nfor a broader racial taxonomy, but differences in clustered genes are\ncontinuous, not discrete, and thus scientists must decide where to\ndraw the line between one genetically clustered race and another. If\nthey program their computers to distinguish four genetic clusters,\nthen European, Asian, Amerindian, and African groups will emerge; if\nonly two clusters are sought, then only the African and Amerindian\n“races” remain (Kitcher 2007, 304). Thus, genetic\nclustering avoids racial mismatch only through the decisions of the\nscientist analyzing the data. The same problem also confronts\ncladistic race, since the number of races will vary from nine, at the\nmost recent period of evolutionary reproductive isolation, to just\none, if we go back to the very beginning, since all humans were\noriginally Africans. But in addition, cladistic race faces a stronger\nmismatch by “cross-classifying” groups that we typically\nthink of as part of the same race, for example by linking northeast\nAsians more closely with Europeans than with more phenotypically\nsimilar southeast Asians. Robin Andreasen defends the cladistic race\nconcept by correctly arguing that folk theories of race have\nthemselves generated counter-intuitive cross-classifications,\nparticularly with respect to the Census’ Asian category, which\npreviously excluded Asian Indians and now excludes native Hawaiians\nand Pacific Islanders. (Andreasen 2005, 100–101; Andreasen 2004,\n430–431; Cf. Glasgow 2003, 456–474; Glasgow 2009,\n91–108). But this hardly saves her argument, since the US\nCensus’s history of shifting racial categories and past use of\nethnic and religious terms (e.g., Filipino, Hindu, and Korean) to\nsignify races is typically taken as evidence of the social,\nrather than biological, foundations of race (Espiritu 1992, Chapter\n5). \nQuayshawn Spencer (2012, 2014, 2019) is resistant to arguments that\ncladistic subspecies are a viable biological candidate for race (2012,\n203). Instead, he defends a version of biological racial realism that\nunderstands “biologically real” as capturing “all of\nthe entities that are used in empirically successful\nbiology…and that adequately rules out all of the entities that\nare not” (2019, 77; see also 95). Spencer argues that such an\nentity exists and can be found in the US government’s Office of\nManagement and Budget (OMB) and its racial classifications. The basis\nfor this claim is that population genetics has identified five\ndistinctive “human continental populations” that satisfy\nthe criteria for biological reality (2019, 98; 95). The OMB\nclassifications map onto these continental populations. The importance\nof the OMB is that its ubiquity in our lives means that one of the\nprimary ways that we talk about race is through its categories.\nSpencer highlights this centrality when he points out the ways that\nAmericans self-report their races correspond to the parameters of the\nOMB classifications (2019, 83–85). Spencer is pluralist about\nrace talk, however, meaning that OMB race is just one dominant meaning\nof race, while there is no single dominant meaning among users of the\nterm (2019, 213). \nIn each case, racial population naturalism encounters problems in\ntrying to demarcate discrete boundaries between different biological\npopulations. If discreteness is indispensable to a human racial\ntaxonomy, then mismatches can only be avoided, if at all, through\nhuman intervention. But as noted above, biological species are also\nnot genetically discrete, and thus boundaries between non-human\nspecies must also be imposed through human intervention. And just as\nthe demarcation of non-human species is justified through its\nscientific usefulness, so too are human racial categories justified.\nFor instance, Andreason contends that a cladistic race concept that\ndivides northeastern from southeastern Asians is scientifically useful\nfor evolutionary research, even if it conflicts with the folk concept\nof a unified Asian race. In turn, the concepts of genetically\nclustered and socially isolated race may remain useful for detecting\nand treating some health problems. Ian Hacking provides a careful\nargument in favor of the provisional use of American racial categories\nin medicine. Noting that racial categories do not reflect\nessentialist, uniform differences, he reiterates the finding that\nthere are statistically significant genetic differences among\ndifferent racial groups. As a result, an African American is more\nlikely to find a bone marrow match from a pool of African American\ndonors than from a pool of white donors. Thus, he defends the practice\nof soliciting African American bone marrow donors, even though this\nmay provide fodder to racist groups who defend an essentialist and\nhierarchical conception of biological race (Hacking 2005,\n102–116; Cf. Kitcher 2007, 312–316). Conversely, Dorothy\nRoberts emphasizes the dangers of using racial categories within\nmedicine, suggesting that it not only validates egregious ideas of\nbiological racial hierarchy but also contributes to conservative\njustifications for limiting race-based affirmative action and even\nsocial welfare funding, which supposedly would be wasted on\ngenetically inferior minority populations. In effect, race-based\nmedicine raises the specter of a new political synthesis of colorblind\nconservatism with biological racialism (Roberts 2008, 537–545).\nHowever, Roberts’ critique fails to engage the literature on the\nstatistical significance of racial categories for genetic differences.\nMoreover, she herself acknowledges that many versions of colorblind\nconservatism do not rely at all on biological justifications. \nStephen Cornell and Douglas Hartmann (1998) provide a helpful\ndiscussion of the differences between the concepts of race and\nethnicity. Relying on social constructivism, they define race as\n“a human group defined by itself or others as distinct by virtue\nof perceived common physical characteristics that are held to be\ninherent…Determining which characteristics constitute the\nrace…is a choice human beings make. Neither markers nor\ncategories are predetermined by any biological factors” (Cornell\nand Hartmann 1998, 24). Ethnicity, conversely, is defined as a sense\nof common ancestry based on cultural attachments, past linguistic\nheritage, religious affiliations, claimed kinship, or some physical\ntraits (1998, 19). Racial identities are typically thought of as\nencompassing multiple ethnic identities (Cornell and Hartmann 1998,\n26). Thus, people who are racially categorized as black may possess a\nvariety of ethnic identities based either on African national or\ncultural markers (e.g., Kenyan, Igbo, Zulu) or the newer national,\nsub-national, or trans-national identities created through the mixing\nof enslaved populations in the Americas (e.g., African American,\nHaitian, West Indian). \nCornell and Hartmann outline five additional characteristics that\ndistinguish race from ethnicity: racial identity is typically\nexternally imposed by outsiders, as when whites created the Negro race\nto homogenize the multiple ethnic groups they conquered in Africa or\nbrought as slaves to America; race is a result of early globalization,\nwhen European explorers “discovered” and then conquered\npeoples with radically different phenotypical traits; race typically\ninvolves power relations, from the basic power to define the race of\nothers to the more expansive power to deprive certain racial groups of\nsocial, economic, or political benefits; racial identities are\ntypically hierarchical, with certain races being perceived as superior\nto others; and racial identity is perceived as inherent, something\nindividuals are born with (1998, 27–29). \nRace and ethnicity differ strongly in the level of agency that\nindividuals exercise in choosing their identity. Individuals rarely\nhave any choice over their racial identity, due to the immediate\nvisual impact of the physical traits associated with race. Individuals\nare thought to exercise more choice over ethnic identification, since\nthe physical differences between ethnic groups are typically less\nstriking, and since individuals can choose whether or not to express\nthe cultural practices associated with ethnicity. So an individual who\nphenotypically appears white with ancestors from Ireland can more\nreadily choose whether to assert their Irish identity (by celebrating\nSt. Patrick’s Day) than whether to choose their white identity\n(Cornell and Hartmann 1998, 29–30). Moreover, Mary Waters (1990)\nargues that the high level of intermarriage among white Americans from\nvarious national ancestries grants their children significant\n“ethnic options” in choosing with which of their multiple\nheritages to identify. Waters (1999) and Philip Kasinitz (1992)\ndocument how phenotypically black West Indian immigrants exercise\nagency in asserting their ethnic identity in order to differentiate\nthemselves from native-born African Americans, but discrimination and\nviolence aimed at all Black people, regardless of ethnicity, strongly\nconstrains such agency.The greater constraints on racial identity stem\nfrom the role of informal perceptions, discriminatory social action,\nand formal laws imposing racial identity, such as Census\ncategorization (Nobles 2000), the infamous “hypodescent”\nlaws, which defined people as black if they had one drop of African\nblood (Davis 1991), and judicial decisions such as the\n“prerequisite cases,” which determined whether specific\nimmigrants could be classified as white and thus eligible for\nnaturalized citizenship (Lopez 1996).  \nThe line between race and ethnicity gets blurred in the case of Asians\nand Latinos in the United States. Yen Le Espiritu (1992) notes that\nAsian American racial identity, which of course encompasses a\nremarkable level of ethnic diversity, results from a combination of\nexternal assignment and agency, as when Asians actively respond to\nanti-Asian discrimination or violence through political action and a\nsense of shared fate. Consequently, Espiritu uses the term\n“panethnicity” to describe Asian American identity, a\nconcept which has racial connotations, given the role of “racial\nlumping” together of members of diverse Asian ethnicities into a\nsingle racial group defined by phenotypical traits. Thus, she declares\nthat “African Americans [are] the earliest and most developed\npan-ethnic group in the United States” (1992, 174). Hispanic or\nLatino identity exhibits traits similar to pan-ethnicity. Indeed,\nunlike Asian identity, Hispanic identity is not even a formal racial\nidentity under the Census. However, informal perceptions, formal laws,\nand discrimination based on physical appearance nevertheless tend to\nlump together various nationalities and ethnicities that share some\nconnection to Latin America (Rodriquez 2000). Moreover, scholars have\nnoted that Jews (Brodkin 1998) and the Irish (Ignatiev 1995) were once\nwere considered distinct, non-white races but are now considered to be\nracially white ethnic groups, partly by exercising agency in\ndistancing themselves from African Americans exercising political\npower. Thus, it is conceivable that groups today considered to be\nsociological racial groups could transform into something more like an\nethnic group. For this reason, Blum describes Hispanics and Asians as\nincompletely racialized groups (Blum 2002, 149–155). \nA robust philosophical debate has emerged regarding the status of\nHispanic or Latino identity. Jorge Gracia (2000) defends the utility\nof Hispanic ethnic identity as grounded primarily in the shared,\nlinguistic culture that can be traced to the Iberian Peninsula. Jorge\nGarcia (2001, 2006) challenges this approach, arguing that the\ndiversity of individual experiences undermines the use of Hispanic\nethnicity as a meaningful form of collective identity. Linda Martin\nAlcoff (2006) develops a “realist” defense of Latino\nidentity against charges of essentialism and views it as a category of\nsolidarity that develops in reaction to white privilege. Christina\nBeltran (2010), on the other hand, does not try to paper over the\ndiversity within Latinidad, which she instead portrays as a\npluralistic, fragmented, and agonistic form of political action.  \nTwo strands in moral, political, and legal philosophy are pertinent to\nthe concept of race. One strand examines the broader conceptual and\nmethodological questions regarding the moral status of race and how to\ntheorize racial justice; the other strand normatively assesses\nspecific policies or institutional forms that seek to redress racial\ninequality, such as affirmative action, racially descriptive\nrepresentation, the general question of colorblindness in law and\npolicy, residential racial segregation, and racism in the criminal\njustice system and policing. \nLawrence Blum, Anthony Appiah, and Tommie Shelby articulate\nindispensable positions in addressing the moral status of the concept\nof race. Blum (2002) examines both the concept of race and the problem\nof racism. He argues that “racism” be restricted to two\nreferents: inferiorization, or the denigration of a group due\nto its putative biological inferiority; and antipathy, or the\n“bigotry, hostility, and hatred” towards another group\ndefined by its putatively inherited physical traits (2002, 8). These\ntwo moral sins deserve this heightened level of condemnation\nassociated with the term racism, because they violate moral norms of\n“respect, equality, and dignity” and because they are\nhistorically connected to extreme and overt forms of racial oppression\n(2002, 27). But because these connections make “racism” so\nmorally loaded a term, it should not be applied to “lesser\nracial ills and infractions” that suggest mere ignorance,\ninsensitivity or discomfort regarding members of different groups\n(28), since doing so will apply a disproportionate judgment against\nthe person so named, closing off possible avenues for fruitful moral\ndialogue. \nDue to the historical connection between racism and extreme\noppression, Blum argues against using the term race, since he rejects\nits biological foundation. Instead, he advocates using the term\n“racialized group” to denote those socially constructed\nidentities whose supposedly inherited common physical traits are used\nto impose social, political, and economic costs. To Blum,\n“racialized group” creates distance from the biological\nconception of race and it admits of degrees, as in the case of\nLatinos, whom Blum describes as an “incompletely racialized\ngroup” (2002, 151). This terminological shift, and its supposed\nrevelation of the socially constructed character of physiognomically\ndefined identities, need not require the rejection of group-specific\npolicies such as affirmative action. Members of sociologically\nconstructed racialized identities suffer real harms, and laws might\nhave to distinguish individuals according to their racialized\nidentities in order to compensate for such harms. Nevertheless, Blum\nremains ambivalent about such measures, arguing that even when\nnecessary they remain morally suspect (2002, 97). \nSimilar ambivalence is also expressed by Anthony Appiah, earlier\ndiscussed regarding the metaphysics of race. While his metaphysical\nracial skepticism was cited as grounding his normative\nposition of eliminativism, Appiah is “against\nraces” but “for racial identities” (1996). Because\nof a wide social consensus that races exist, individuals are ascribed\nto races regardless of their individual choices or desires. Moreover,\nracial identity remains far more salient and costly than ethnic\nidentity (1996, 80–81). As a result, mobilization along racial\nlines is justifiable, in order to combat racism. But even at this\npoint, Appiah still fears that racial identification may constrain\nindividual autonomy by requiring members of racial groups to behave\naccording to certain cultural norms or “scripts” that have\nbecome dominant within a specific racial group. Appiah thus concludes,\n“Racial identity can be the basis of resistance to racism; but\neven as we struggle against racism…let us not let our racial\nidentities subject us to new tyrannies” (1996, 104). This\nresidual ambivalence, to recall the metaphysical discussions of the\nlast section, perhaps ground Mallon’s contention that Appiah\nremains an eliminativist rather than a racial\nconstructivist, since ideally Appiah would prefer to be free of\nall residual constraints entailed by even socially constructed\nraces. \nTommie Shelby responds to the ambivalence of Appiah and Blum by\ndistinguishing classical black nationalism, which rested upon\nan organic black identity, with pragmatic black nationalism,\nbased on an instrumental concern with combating antiblack racism\n(2005, 38–52; 2003, 666–668). Pragmatic nationalism allows\nBlack people to generate solidarity across class or cultural lines, not just\nthrough the modus vivendi of shared interests but upon a\nprincipled commitment to racial equality and justice (2005,\n150–154). As a result, black solidarity is grounded upon a\nprincipled response to common oppression, rather than some putative\nshared identity (2002), thus mitigating the dangers of biological\nessentialism and tyrannical cultural conformity that Appiah associates\nwith race and racial identities. Anna Stubblefield (2005) provides an\nalternative defense of Black solidarity by comparing it to familial\ncommitments. \nShelby (2005, 7) briefly mentions that his pragmatic, political\nversion of black solidarity is compatible with John Rawls’s\nPolitical Liberalism, but his more detailed defense of the\nideal social contract method of Rawls’s A Theory of Justice\nfor theorizing racial justice has drawn substantial controversy\n(Shelby 2004). Elizabeth Anderson eschews ideal theory for analyzing\nracial justice because it assumes motivational and cognitive\ncapacities beyond those of ordinary humans; it risks promoting ideal\nnorms (like colorblindness) under unjust conditions that require\nrace-specific policies; and its idealizing assumptions, like an\noriginal position in which parties do not know relevant personal and\nsocial racial facts, precludes recognition of historical and present\nracial injustice. She instead uses a normative framework of democratic\nequality to ground her moral imperative of integration. \nCharles Mills, extending his critique of how early modern social\ncontract thinking obfuscates racial injustice (1997), fears that\nRawls’s ideal theory can similarly serve as an ideology that\nwhitewashes non-white oppression (Mills 2013). But rather than\njettisoning a contractarian approach entirely, Mills instead develops\na model of a non-ideal contract, in which the parties do not know\ntheir own racial identities but are aware of their society’s history\nof racial exploitation and its effects. Because the parties know of\nracial hierarchy but do not know if they will be its beneficiaries or\nvictims, Mills hypothesizes that they will rationally agree to racial\nreparations as a form of corrective or rectificatory justice (Pateman\nand Mills 2007, Chapters 3, 4, 8). \nShelby responds that, while Rawls’s ideal theory of justice excludes a\ntheory of rectification because it is not comprehensive, rectificatory\njustice is not only complementary but in fact presupposes an ideal\ntheory that can clarify when injustices have occurred and need to be\nrectified. More importantly, Shelby suggests that complying with\nrectificatory justice through racial reparations could well leave\nBlack people living in a society that nevertheless remains racially unjust\nin other ways. For this reason, Shelby concludes that ideal theory\nremains indispensable (2013). \nChristopher Lebron (2013, 28–42) also suggests that the\napproaches of Rawls and Mills are complementary, but in a very\ndifferent way. He argues that Rawls’s focus on the basic structure of\nsociety provides explanatory mechanisms through which white supremacy\npersists, something unspecified in earlier work by Mills (2003). And\nin sharp contrast to Shelby (2013), Lebron criticizes Mills for\nrehabilitating Rawlsian contract thinking, since even a non-ideal form\neliminates the epistemological advantage of a non-white perspective on\nwhite supremacy. Instead of reformulating contractarian thinking to\nfit the needs of racial justice, Lebron instead focuses on analyzing\nhow “historically evolved power” and “socially\nembedded power” perpetuate racial injustice. \nTurning to the second strand of practical philosophy devoted to race,\nvarious scholars have addressed policies such as affirmative action,\nrace-conscious electoral districting, and colorblindness in policy and\nlaw. The literature on affirmative action is immense, and may be\ndivided into approaches that focus on compensatory justice,\ndistributive justice, critiques of the concept of merit, and diversity\nof perspective. Alan Goldman (1979) generally argues against\naffirmative action, since jobs or educational opportunities as a rule\nshould go to those most qualified. Only when a specific individual has\nbeen victimized by racial or other discrimination can the otherwise\nirrelevant factor of race be used as a compensatory measure to award a\nposition or a seat at a university. Ronald Fiscus (1992) rejects the\ncompensatory scheme in favor of a distributive justice argument. He\nclaims that absent the insidious and invidious effects of a racist\nsociety, success in achieving admissions to selective universities or\nattractive jobs would be randomly distributed across racial lines.\nThus, he concludes that distributive justice requires the racially\nproportional distribution of jobs and university seats. Of course,\nFiscus’s argument displaces the role of merit in the awarding of\njobs or university admissions, but this point is addressed by Iris\nYoung (1990, Chapter 7), who argues that contemporary criteria of\nmerit, such as standardized testing and educational achievement, are\nbiased against disadvantaged racial and other groups, and rarely are\nfunctionally related to job performance or academic potential.\nFinally, Michel Rosenfeld (1991) turns away from substantive theories\nof justice in favor of a conception of justice as reversibility, a\nposition influenced by the “Discourse Ethics” of\nJürgen Habermas (1990), which defines justice not by the proper\nsubstantive awarding of goods but as the result of a fair discursive\nprocedure that includes all relevant viewpoints and is free of\ncoercive power relations. Thus, affirmative action is justified as an\nattempt to include racially diverse viewpoints. All of these positions\nare summarily discussed in a useful debate format in Cohen and Sterba\n(2003). \nThe issues of race-conscious electoral districting and descriptive\nracial representation have also garnered substantial attention.\nRace-conscious districting is the practice of drawing geographically\nbased electoral districts in which the majority of voters are Black.\nDescriptive racial representation holds that Black populations are best\nrepresented by Black politicians. Iris Marion Young (1990,\n183–191) provides a spirited defense of descriptive\nrepresentation for racial minorities, grounded in their experiences of\n“oppression, the institutional constraint on\nself-determination”, and domination “the institutional\nconstraint on self-determination” (1990, 37). Anne Phillips\n(1995) furthers this position, arguing that representatives who are\nmembers of minority racial groups can enhance legislative\ndeliberation. Melissa Williams (1998) also defends the deliberative\ncontribution of descriptive racial representation, but adds that\nminority constituents are more likely to trust minority\nrepresentatives, since both will be affected by laws that overtly or\ncovertly discriminate against minority racial groups. Finally, Jane\nMansbridge (1999) carefully demonstrates why a critical mass of\nminority representatives is needed, in order to adequately advocate\nfor common minority interests as well as to convey the internal\ndiversity within the group. In a later work, Young (2000) addresses\ncritics who argue that descriptive representation relies upon group\nessentialism, since members of a racial group need not all share the\nsame interests or opinions. In response, Young suggests that members\nof the same racial group do share the same “social\nperspective” grounded in common experiences, similar to the\ninteractive kind variant of racial constructivism\ndiscussed earlier. But because it is unclear that Black individuals\nare more likely to share common experiences than common interests or\nopinions, Michael James prioritizes using race-conscious districting\nto create Black racial constituencies which can hold Black or\nnon-Black representatives accountable to Black interests (James 2011).\nAbigail Thernstrom (1987) condemns race-conscious districting for\nviolating the original principles behind the 1965 Voting Rights Act\nand the 15th Amendment, by promoting the election of black\nrepresentatives rather than simply guaranteeing black voters the right\nto cast ballots. J. Morgan Kousser (1999) responds that race-conscious\ndistricting simply reflects the right to cast a\n“meaningful” vote, as implied by the 15th\nAmendment protection against not only the denial but also the\n“abridgment” of the right to vote. Lani Guinier (1994)\ncompellingly suggests that instead of drawing majority black\ndistricts, we should adopt more proportional electoral system that\nfacilitate the electoral strength of racial and other minorities.\nMichael James (2004) suggests that alternative electoral systems\nfacilitate not only descriptive racial representation but also\ndemocratic deliberation across racial lines. \nA general advantage of using alternative electoral systems to enhance\nminority racial representation is that they are technically\ncolorblind, not requiring lawmakers or judges to group citizens\naccording to their racial identities. The general value of\ncolorblindness is an ongoing topic of debate within legal philosophy.\nDrawing on Justice John Marshall Harlan’s famous dissent in Plessy\nv. Ferguson, and a not-uncontroversial interpretation of the\norigins of the equal protection clause, Andrew Kull (1992) argues that\ncontemporary American statutory and constitutional law should strive\nto be colorblind and combat racial inequality without dividing\ncitizens into different racial groups. Ian Haney Lopez (2006,\n143–162), on the other hand, fears “colorblind white\ndominance,” whereby facially race-neutral laws leave untouched\nthe race-based inequality that operates within American political,\nlegal, and economic structures. Elizabeth Anderson (2010) provides a\ntrenchant critique of colorblindness as a normative standard for law,\npolicy, or ethics. Racial segregation and the potential for\nintegration have garnered much less philosophical attention than\naffirmative action and racially descriptive representation. Bernard\nBoxill (1992) offers a treatment of busing and self-segregation, while\nHoward McGary (1999) offers a clarification of integration and\nseparation. Iris Young (2002, chapter 6) treats residential\nsegregation in the context of regional democracy, while Owen Fiss\n(2003) analyzes it in the context of the legacy of racism. Anderson\nherself (2010) argues for the moral imperative of integration, with\nTommie Shelby (2014) and Ronald Sundstrom (2013) offering critical\nresponses to Anderson’s argument. More recently, Andrew Valls (2018,\nchapter 6) has written on the subject. \nIn recent years, the problem of racism within policing and criminal\njustice in the United States has attracted intense popular and\nscholarly attention. Mathias Risse and Richard Zeckhauser (2004) offer\na qualified defense of racial profiling that engages both utilitarian\nand non-consequentialist reasoning. Annabelle Lever’s (2005)\nobjection and response prompted a subsequent round of debate (Risse\n2007, Lever 2007). Michelle Alexander (2010) famously depicted the\ncontemporary American criminal justice system as the “New Jim\nCrow,” for its intense racial disparities. Naomi Zack (2015)\nprovides a trenchant critique of racial profiling and police homicide.\nDavid Boonin (2011), on the other hand, reluctantly defends racial\nprofiling on pragmatic grounds. Finally, Adam Hosein (2018) argues\nagainst it for reasons of political equality. Shelby (2016) offers a\njustification of Black resistance based in the unjust legacy of racial\nsegregation while deepening his earlier critique of Anderson’s\nview. \nWhile the debates in contemporary philosophy of race within the\nanalytic tradition have largely revolved around whether or not races\nexist along with criteria for determining realness or existence,\nphilosophers working in the Continental traditions have taken up the\nconcept of race along other dimensions (see Bernasconi and Cook 2003\nfor an overview). First, those working within the traditions of\nExistentialism and Phenomenology have called on Fanon, Merleau-Ponty,\nand Sartre, among others, to understand how race and functions within\nour lived, bodily experiences of everyday life. This strand of\nscholarship focuses on the materiality of race. As Emily S. Lee puts\nit, “both the social structural and the individual subconscious\nlevels of analysis rely on perceiving the embodiment of race”\n(2014, 1). Second, philosophers building on the work of Michel\nFoucault have articulated genealogical understandings of race that\nfocus on its historical emergence as a concept and the ways that it\nhas functioned within discourses of knowledge and power. \nFrantz Fanon has been the primary influence for those understanding\nrace and racism within Existentialism and Phenomenology. In Black\nSkin, White Masks Fanon writes, “I came into this world\nanxious to uncover the meaning of things, my soul desirous to be at\nthe origin of the world, and here I am an object among other\nobjects” (2008/1952, 89). Furthermore, this “inferiority\nis determined by the Other,” by the “white gaze”\n(2008/1952, 90). Such a position is understood through the schema of\nthe body: “In a white world, the man of color encounters\ndifficulties in elaborating his body schema. The image of one’s body\nis solely negating. It’s an image in the third person”\n(2008/1952, 90). Rather than being at home in his own body, and moving\n“out of habit,” Fanon understands his body as existing\nprimarily as an object for others, requiring him to move “by\nimplicit knowledge” of the rules and norms of that white world\n(2008/1952, 91). \nFanon critiques Sartre’s understanding of race and racism by\npointing out that Sartre understands antiracism as a negative movement\nthat will be overcome (2008/1952, 111–112). Sartre treats\nantiracism as the transition toward something else and not as an end\nin itself. Against this view Fanon writes, “ Sartre forgets that\nthe Black man suffers in his body quite differently from the white\nman” (2008/1952, 117). He is trapped by his body schema,\n“a toy in the hands of the white man” (2008/1952,\n119). \nLewis Gordon draws on both Fanon and Sartre in articulating his\nAfricana existentialism. He distinguishes between Existentialism as a\nspecific historical European movement and philosophies of existence,\nor existential philosophies, which are preoccupied with\n“freedom, anguish, responsibility, embodied agency, sociality,\nand liberation.” These concerns yield a focus on the\n“lived context of concern” (2000, 10). For Gordon, due to\nthe history of racial oppression of Black peoples, an Africana\nexistential philosophy revolves around the questions, “what does\nit mean to be a problem, and what is to be understood by Black\nsuffering?” (2000, 8). \nAccording to Gordon, what is sometimes referred to as the “race\nquestion” is really a question about the status of Blackness,\nfor “race has emerged, throughout its history, as the question\nfundamentally of ‘the blacks’ as it has for no other\ngroup” (2000, 12). Rather than a denial that other groups have\nbeen racialized, the claim instead is that such other racializations\nhave been conditioned on a scale of European personhood to Black\nsubpersonhood (see also Mills 1998, 6–10). Blackness itself has been\ncharacterized as “the breakdown of reason” and “an\nexistential enigma” in such a way that to ask after race and\nracialization is to ask after Blackness in the first instance. \nBoth Gordon and Zack use Sartre’s notion of bad faith to\nunderstand race. We can understand bad faith as the evasion of\nresponsibility and fidelity to human freedom, and an understanding of\nthe human being as a for-itself. Bad faith falsely turns the human\nbeing into an object without agency, into an in-itself. For Gordon,\nantiblack racism conceives of Blackness itself as a problem so as to\navoid having to understand Black problems. As a result, actual Black\npeople disappear along with any responsibility to them (1997, 74).\nGordon gives the example of The Philadelphia Negro, Du\nBois’ sociological study of the residents of Philadelphia’s\nSeventh Ward. Gordon recounts how those commissioning the study set Du\nBois up to fail so that he would only perpetuate the pathologizing of\nthe Black population, presenting Blackness itself as a problem rather\nthan attempt to understand the problems of Black people and\ncommunities (2000, 69). \nWhereas Gordon uses bad faith to understand antiblack racism, Zack\ndoes so to deepen her eliminativism. For Sartre, authenticity is the\nantidote to bad faith – to live authentically is to understand\nand embrace human freedom rather than evade it. Zack’s\neliminativism attributes bad faith to those who affirm that racial\ndesignations describe human beings when in fact they do not (1993,\n3–4). If racial identifications lack adequate support because\nraces do not exist, then identification as mixed race is also done in\nbad faith. Instead, Zack understands her position of\n“anti-race” as true authenticity that looks to the future\nin the name of freedom and resistance to oppression in the name of\nracelessness (1993, 164). \nEmbodiment and visibility are central to these views. Gordon\nunderstands the body as “our perspective in the world,”\nwhich occurs along (at least) three matrices: seeing, being seen, and\nbeing conscious of being seen (1997, 71). In an antiblack world this\nmeans that the Black body is a form of absence, going unseen in the\nsame manner as Ralph Ellison’s protagonist in Invisible Man\n(1997, 72–3). George Yancy tells us that he writes from his\n“lived embodied experience,” which is a “site of\nexposure” (2008, 65). Black embodiment here is the lens used to\ncritique whiteness and its normative gaze. For Yancy, Black resistance\nitself decodes and recodes Black embodied existence, affirming the\nvalue of the Black body in the face of centuries of white denial\n(2008, 112–3). \nLinda Martín Alcoff offers a phenomenological account of race that\nhighlights a “visual registry,” which is socially and\nhistorically constructed and that is “determinant over\nindividual experience” (2006, 194). Like Yancy, Alcoff locates\nrace in embodied lived experience. Drawing on Maurice\nMerleau-Ponty’s work, Alcoff notes how the way that our perceptual\npractices are organized affects the way we come to know the world\n(2006, 188). When race operates through visibility, these ways of\nnormalized perceptual knowing become racialized. As she notes,\n“racial consciousness works through learned practices and habits\nof visual discrimination and visual marks on the body…race\nexists there on the body itself” (2006, 196). \nLee argues that racial meaning fits squarely within the space that a\nphenomenological framework seeks to explore, namely, the space between\nthe natural and the cultural, the objective and the subjective, and\nthinking and nonthinking (Lee 2014, 8). Furthermore, a\nphenomenological approach can illuminate how, even when race is\nunderstood as a social construction, it can nonetheless become\nnaturalized through “the sedimentation of racial meaning into\nthe very structures and practices of society” (Lee 2019,\nxi). \nA second line of thought runs through the work of Michel Foucault. In\nhis 1975–1976 lectures at the Collège de France, published\nas Society Must Be Defended, Foucault details the emergence\nof a discourse on race beginning in early 17th Century England.\nAccording to Foucault, race war discourse emerges through claims of\nillegitimacy against the Stuart monarchy. These claims were couched in\nthe language of injustice as well as foreign invasion, in which an\nindigenous race is pitted against in invading outsider (2003, 60).\nRace, at this point, is not a biological concept, instead referring to\nlineage, custom, and tradition (2003, 77). Only later does this\ncultural notion of race transform into the scientific notion of\nrace. \nCornel West employs a Foucaultian methodology to produce a genealogy\nof modern racism (1982). West analyzes how the discourse of modernity\ncame into being to show how central white supremacy is to its\npractices of knowledge and meaning making (47). By modern discourse he\nmeans, “The controlling metaphors, notions, categories, and\nnorms that shape the predominant conception of truth and knowledge in\nthe modern West,” which are driven by the scientific revolution,\nthe Cartesian transformation of philosophy, and the classical revival\n(50). It is a discourse comprising certain forms of rationality,\nscientificity, objectivity, and aesthetic and cultural ideals, the\nparameters of which exclude Black equality from the outset, marking it\nas unintelligible and illegitimate within the prevailing norms of\ndiscourse and knowledge (47–48). Notions of truth and knowledge\nproduced by these three forces are governed by a value-free subject\nthat observes, compares, orders, and measures in order to obtain\nevidence and make inferences that verify the true representations of\nreality. \nLadelle McWhorter uses Foucault’s lectures to conduct a\ngenealogy of racism and sexual oppression of a more proximate time and\nplace. According to McWhorter, “racism in twentieth-century\nAnglo-America [has] to be understood in light of Foucault’s work on\nnormalization,” where racism exists as a crusade against\ndeviance, abnormality, and pathology (2009, 12). Building on\nFoucault’s analysis of race war discourse McWhorter carries out a\ngenealogy of race, ultimately arguing that race and sexuality\n“are historically codependent and mutually determinative”\n(2009, 14). Anglo-American discourse on race is therefore linked to\ndiscourses on eugenics, the family, sexual predation, normality, and\npopulation management, all of which function within the networks of\npower that Foucault referred to biopower (2009, 15). Ann Laura Stoler\n(1995) offers an extended reconstruction and critique of\nFoucault’s treatment of race in light of colonialism and\nempire. Joy James goes even further, arguing that Foucault is not useful for thinking about race at all (1996, chapter 1).","contact.mail":"mjames@bucknell.edu","contact.domain":"bucknell.edu"},{"date.published":"2008-05-28","date.changed":"2020-05-25","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/race/","author1":"Michael James","author2":"Adam Burgos","author1.info":"https://www.bucknell.edu/arts-and-sciences-college-of/academic-departments-and-programs/political-science/faculty-and-staff/michael-james.html","entry":"race","body.text":"\n\n\nThe concept of race has historically signified the division of\nhumanity into a small number of groups based upon five criteria: (1)\nRaces reflect some type of biological foundation, be it Aristotelian\nessences or modern genes; (2) This biological foundation generates\ndiscrete racial groupings, such that all and only all members of one\nrace share a set of biological characteristics that are not shared by\nmembers of other races; (3) This biological foundation is inherited\nfrom generation to generation, allowing observers to identify an\nindividual’s race through her ancestry or genealogy; (4)\nGenealogical investigation should identify each race’s geographic\norigin, typically in Africa, Europe, Asia, or North and South America;\nand (5) This inherited racial biological foundation manifests itself\nprimarily in physical phenotypes, such as skin color, eye shape, hair\ntexture, and bone structure, and perhaps also behavioral phenotypes,\nsuch as intelligence or delinquency.\n\n\nThis historical concept of race has faced substantial scientific and\nphilosophical challenge, with some important thinkers denying both the\nlogical coherence of the concept and the very existence of races.\nOthers defend the concept of race, albeit with substantial changes to\nthe foundations of racial identity, which they depict as either\nsocially constructed or, if biologically grounded, neither discrete\nnor essentialist, as the historical concept would have it.\n\n\nBoth in the past and today, determining the boundaries of discrete\nraces has proven to be most vexing and has led to great variations in\nthe number of human races believed to be in existence. Thus, some\nthinkers categorized humans into only four distinct races (typically\nwhite or Caucasian, Black or African, yellow or Asian, and red or\nNative American), and downplayed any biological or phenotypical\ndistinctions within racial groups (such as those between Scandinavians\nand Spaniards within the white or Caucasian race). Other thinkers\nclassified humans into many more racial categories, for instance\narguing that those humans “indigenous” to Europe could be\ndistinguished into discrete Nordic, Alpine, and Mediterranean\nraces.\n\n\nThe ambiguities and confusion associated with determining the\nboundaries of racial categories have provoked a widespread scholarly\nconsensus that discrete or essentialist races are socially\nconstructed, not biologically real. However, significant scholarly\ndebate persists regarding whether reproductive isolation, either\nduring human evolution or through modern practices barring\nmiscegenation, may have generated sufficient genetic isolation as to\njustify using the term race to signify the existence of non-discrete\nhuman groups that share not only physical phenotypes but also clusters\nof genetic material. In addition, scholarly debate exists concerning\nthe formation and character of socially constructed, discrete racial\ncategories. For instance, some scholars suggest that race is\ninconceivable without racialized social hierarchies, while others\nargue that egalitarian race relations are possible. Finally,\nsubstantial controversy surrounds the moral status of racial identity\nand solidarity and the justice and legitimacy of policies or\ninstitutions aimed at undermining racial inequality.\n\n\nThis entry focuses primarily on contemporary scholarship regarding the\nconceptual, ontological, epistemological, and normative questions\npertaining to race, with an introductory section on the history of the\nconcept of race in the West and in Western philosophy. Aside from some\ndiscussion in Section 5, it does not focus in depth on authors such as\nFrederick Douglass, W.E.B. DuBois, or Frantz Fanon, or movements, such\nas Négritude, Critical Race Theory, Black Identity, Philosophy of\nLiberation, or Feminist Perspectives on Race. Interested readers\nshould consult the relevant entries in the Stanford Encyclopedia of\nPhilosophy for insight into these and other topics important to the\nstudy of race in philosophy.\n\n\nIn Section 1, we trace the historical origins and development of the\nconcept of race. Section 2 covers contemporary philosophical debates\nover whether races actually exist. Thereafter, in Section 3 we examine\nthe differences between race and ethnicity. Section 4 surveys debates\namong moral, political and legal philosophers over the validity of\nracial identity, racial solidarity, and race-specific policies such as\naffirmative action and race-based representation. Section 5 outlines\nengagement with the concept of race within Continental philosophy.\n\nThe dominant scholarly position is that the concept of race is a\nmodern phenomenon, at least in Europe and the Americas. However, there\nis less agreement regarding whether racism, even absent a\ndeveloped race concept, may have existed in the ancient Greek and\nRoman worlds. The influential work of classicist Frank Snowden (1970;\n1983), who emphasized the lack of antiblack prejudice in the ancient\nworld, led many scholars of race to conclude that racism did not exist\nin that epoch. However, later classicists have responded that\nSnowden’s work unnecessarily reduced all forms of racism to its\npeculiarly American version based on skin color and other markers of\nnon-white identity. Benjamin Isaac (2004) and Denise McCoskey (2012)\ncontend that the ancient Greeks and Romans did hold proto-racist views\nthat applied to other groups which today might be considered white.\nIsaac persuasively argues that these views must be\nconsidered proto-racist: although they were formed without\nthe aid of a modern race concept grounded in ideas of deterministic\nbiology (2004, 5), they nevertheless resembled modern racism by\nattributing “to groups of people common characteristics\nconsidered to be unalterable because they are determined by external\nfactors or heredity” (2004, 38). More importantly, both Isaac\nand McCoskey contend that ancient proto-racism influenced the\ndevelopment of modern racism. \nPerhaps the first, unconscious stirrings of the concept of race arose\nwithin the Iberian Peninsula. Following the Moorish conquest of\nAndalusia in the eighth century C.E., the Iberian Peninsula became the\nsite of the greatest intermingling between Jewish, Christian, and\nMuslim believers. During and after\ntheir reconquista (reconquest) of the Muslim principalities\nin the peninsula, the Catholic Monarchs Isabel and Ferdinand sought to\nestablish a uniformly Christian state by expelling first the Jews (in\n1492) and then the Muslims (in 1502). But because large numbers of\nboth groups converted to Christianity to avoid expulsion (and before\nthis to avoid persecution), the monarchs distrusted the authenticity\nof these Jewish and Muslim conversos (converts). To ensure\nthat only truly faithful Christians remained within the realm, the\ngrand inquisitor Torquemada reformulated the Inquisition to inquire\nnot just into defendants’ religious faith and practices but into\ntheir lineage. Only those who could demonstrate their ancestry to\nthose Christians who resisted the Moorish invasion were secure in\ntheir status in the realm. Thus, the idea of purity of blood was born\n(limpieza de sangre), not fully the biological concept of\nrace but perhaps the first occidental use of blood heritage as a\ncategory of religio-political membership (Bernasconi and Lott 2000,\nvii; Hannaford 1996, 122–126; Frederickson 2002,\n31–35). \nThe Iberian Peninsula may also have witnessed the first stirrings of\nantiblack and anti-Native-American racism. Since this region was the\nfirst in Europe to utilize African slavery while gradually rejecting\nthe enslavement of fellow European Christians, Iberian Christians may\nhave come to associate Black people as physically and mentally suitable only\nfor menial labor. In this they were influenced by Arab slave\nmerchants, who assigned the worst tasks to their dark-skinned slaves\nwhile assigning more complex labor to light or tawny-skinned slaves\n(Frederickson 2002, 29). The “discovery” of the New World\nby Iberian explorers also brought European Christians into contact\nwith indigenous Americans for the first time. This resulted in the\nheated debate in Valladolid in 1550 between Bartolomé Las Casas\nand Gines de Sepúlveda over whether the Indians were by nature\ninferior and thus worthy of enslavement and conquest. Whether due to\nLas Casas’ victory over Sepúlveda, or due to the\nhierarchical character of Spanish Catholicism which did not require\nthe dehumanization of other races in order to justify slavery, the\nSpanish empire did avoid the racialization of its conquered peoples\nand African slaves. Indeed, arguably it was the conflict between the\nEnlightenment ideals of universal freedom and equality versus the fact\nof the European enslavement of Africans and indigenous Americans that\nfostered the development of the idea of race (Blum 2002,\n111–112; Hannaford 1996, 149–150). \nWhile events in the Iberian Peninsula may have provided the initial\nstirrings of modern racial sentiments, the concept of race, with its\nclose links to ideas of deterministic biology, emerged with the rise\nof modern natural philosophy and its concern with taxonomy (Smith\n2015). The first important articulation of the race concept came with\nthe 1684 publication of “A New Division of the Earth” by\nFrancois Bernier (1625–1688) (Bernasconi and Lott 2000, viii;\nHannaford 1996, 191, 203). Based on his travels through Egypt, India,\nand Persia, this essay presented a division of humanity into\n“four or five species or races of men in particular whose\ndifference is so remarkable that it may be properly made use of as the\nfoundation for a new division of the earth” (Bernasconi and Lott\n2000, 1–2). First were the peoples inhabiting most of Europe and\nNorth Africa, extending eastward through Persia, northern and central\nIndia, and right up to parts of contemporary Indonesia. Despite their\ndiffering skin tones, these peoples nevertheless shared common\nphysical characteristics, such as hair texture and bone structure. The\nsecond race was constituted by the people of Africa south of the\nSahara Desert, who notably possessed smooth Black skin, thick noses\nand lips, thin beards, and wooly hair. The peoples inhabiting lands\nfrom east Asia, through China, today’s central Asian states such\nas Uzbekistan, and westward into Siberia and eastern Russia\nrepresented the third race, marked by their “truly white”\nskin, broad shoulders, flat faces, flat noses, thin beards, and long,\nthin eyes, while the short and squat Lapps of northern Scandinavia\nconstituted the fourth race. Bernier considered whether the indigenous\npeoples of the Americas were a fifth race, but he ultimately assigned\nthem to the first (Bernasconi and Lott 2000, 2–3). \nBut while Bernier initiated the use of the term “race” to\ndistinguish different groups of humans based on physical traits, his\nfailure to reflect on the relationship between racial division and the\nhuman race in general mitigated the scientific rigor of his definition\n(Bernasconi and Lott 2000, viii). Central to a scientific concept of\nrace would be a resolution of the question of monogenesis versus\npolygenesis. Monogenesis adhered to the Biblical creation story in\nasserting that all humans descended from a common ancestor, perhaps\nAdam of the Book of Genesis; polygenesis, on the other hand, asserted\nthat different human races descended from different ancestral roots.\nThus, the former position contended that all races are nevertheless\nmembers of a common human species, whereas the latter saw races as\ndistinct species. \nDavid Hume’s position on the debate between polygenesis versus\nmonogenesis is the subject of some scholarly debate. The bone of\ncontention is his essay “Of National Characters,” where he\ncontends that differences among European nations are attributable not\nto natural differences but to cultural and political influences.\nAmidst this argument against crude naturalism, Hume inserts a footnote\nin the 1754 edition, wherein he writes: “I am apt to\nsuspect the negroes and in general all the other species of men\n(for there are four or five different kinds) to be naturally\ninferior to whites. There never was a civilized nation of\nany other complexion than white, nor even any individual eminent\neither in action or speculation” (Zack 2002, 15; emphasis\nadded). Whereas even the most barbarous white nations such as the\nGermans “have something eminent about them,” the\n“uniform and constant difference” in accomplishment\nbetween whites and non-whites could not occur “if nature had not\nmade an original distinction betwixt these breeds of men” (Zack\n2002, 15). Responding to criticism, he softens this position in the\n1776 edition, restricting his claims to natural inferiority only to\n“negroes,” stating that “scarcely ever was\na civilized nation of that complexion, not even of individual eminent\nin action or speculation” (Zack 2002, 17; Hume 1776 [1987], 208;\nemphasis added). Richard Popkin (1977) and Naomi Zack (2002,\n13–18) contend that the 1754 version of the essay assumes,\nwithout demonstration, an original, polygenetic difference between\nwhite and non-white races. Andrew Valls (2005, 132) denies that either\nversion of the footnote espouses polygenesis. \nA strong and clear defense of monogenesis was provided by Immanuel\nKant (1724–1804) in his essay “Of the Different Human\nRaces,” first published in 1775 and revised in 1777. Kant argued\nthat all humans descend from a common human “lineal root\ngenus” in Europe, which contained the biological\n“seeds” and “dispositions” that can generate\nthe distinct physical traits of race when triggered by divergent\nenvironmental factors, especially combinations of heat and humidity.\nThis, combined with patterns of migration, geographic isolation, and\nin-breeding, led to the differentiation of four distinct, pure races:\nthe “noble blond” of northern Europe; the “copper\nred” of America (and east Asia); the “black” of\nSenegambia in Africa; and the “olive-yellow” of\nAsian-India. Once these discrete racial groups were developed over\nmany generations, further climatic changes will not alter racial\nphenotypes (Bernasconi and Lott 2000, 8–22). \nYet despite the distinction generated between different races,\nKant’s monogenetic account led him to maintain that the different\nraces were part of a common human species. As evidence, he adduced the\nfact that individuals from different races were able to breed\ntogether, and their offspring tended to exhibit blended physical\ntraits inherited from both parents. Not only did blending indicate\nthat the parents were part of a common species; it also indicated that\nthey are of distinct races. For the physical traits of parents of the\nsame race are not blended but often passed on exclusively: a blond\nwhite man and a brunette white woman may have four blond children,\nwithout any blending of this physical trait; whereas a Black man and a\nwhite woman will bear children who blend white and Black traits\n(Bernasconi and Lott 2000, 9–10). Such inter-racial mixtures\naccounted for the existence of liminal individuals, whose physical\ntraits seem to lie between the discrete boundaries of one of the four\nraces; peoples who do not fit neatly into one or another race are\nexplained away as groups whose seeds have not been fully triggered by\nthe appropriate environmental stimuli (Bernasconi and Lott 2000,\n11). \nThe “science” of race was furthered by the man sometimes\nconsidered to be the father of modern anthropology, Johann Friedrich\nBlumenbach (1752–1840). In his doctoral dissertation, “On\nthe Natural Variety of Mankind,” first published in 1775,\nBlumenbach identified four “varieties” of mankind: the\npeoples of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. His essay was revised\nand republished both in 1781, wherein he introduced a fifth variety of\nmankind, that inhabiting the South Pacific islands, and in 1795,\nwherein he first coined the term “Caucasian” to describe\nthe variety of people inhabiting Europe, West Asia, and Northern\nIndia. This term reflected his claim that this variety originated in\nthe Caucuses mountains, in Georgia, justifying this etiology through\nreference to the superior beauty of the Georgians. The 1795 version\nalso included the terms Mongolian to describe the non-Caucasian\npeoples of Asia, Ethiopian to signify Black Africans, American to\ndenote the indigenous peoples of the New World, and Malay to identify\nthe South Pacific Islanders (Bernasconi and Lott 2000, 27–33;\nHannaford 1996, 207). \nWhile noting differences in skin tone, he based his varieties upon the\nstructures of the cranium, which supposedly gave his distinctions a\nstronger scientific foundation than the more superficial\ncharacteristic of color (Hannaford 1996, 206). In addition, he\nstrongly denied polygenetic accounts of racial difference, noting the\nability of members of different varieties to breed with each other,\nsomething that humans were incapable of doing with other species.\nIndeed, he took great pains to dismiss as spurious accounts of\nAfricans mating with apes or of monstrous creatures formed through the\nunion of humans with other animals (Hannaford 1996, 208–209). In\nfinal support of his more scientific, monogenist approach, Blumenbach\nposited the internal, biological force which generated racial\ndifference, the “nisus formativus,” which when triggered\nby specific environmental stimuli generated the variations found\nwithin the varieties of humans (Hannaford 1996, 212). \nDespite the strong monogenist arguments provided by Kant and\nBlumenbach, polygenesis remained a viable intellectual strain within\nrace theory, particularly in the “American School of\nAnthropology,” embodied by Louis Agassiz, Robins Gliddon, and\nJosiah Clark Nott. Agassiz was born in Switzerland, received an M.D.\nin Munich and later studied zoology, geology, and paleontology in\nvarious German universities under the influence of Romantic scientific\ntheories. His orthodox Christian background initially imbued him with\na strong monogenist commitment, but upon visiting America and seeing\nan African American for the first time, Agassiz experienced a type of\nconversion experience, which led him to question whether these\nremarkably different people could share the same blood as Europeans.\nEventually staying on and making his career in America, and\ncontinually struck by the physical character of African Americans,\nAgassiz officially announced his turn to polygenesis at the 1850\nmeeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science\n(AAAS) in Charleston, South Carolina. Nott, a South Carolina\nphysician, attended the same AAAS meeting and, along with Gliddon,\njoined Agassiz in the promulgation of the American School’s\ndefense of polygenesis (Brace 2005, 93–103). \nAlong with Agassiz, Nott was also influenced by the French romantic\nrace theorist Arthur de Gobineau (1816–1882), whose “Essay\non the Inequality of the Human Races” (1853–1855) Nott\npartially translated into English and published for the American\naudience. Although the Catholic Gobineau initially espoused\nmonogenesis, he later leaned towards polygenesis and ended up\nambivalent on this issue (Hannaford 1996, 268–269).\nNevertheless, Gobineau lent credence to the white racial supremacy\nthat Nott supported (Brace 2005, 120–121). Gobineau posited two\nimpulses among humans, that of attraction and repulsion. Civilization\nemerges when humans obey the law of attraction and intermingle with\npeoples of different racial stocks. According the Gobineau, the white\nrace was created through such intermingling, which allowed it alone to\ngenerate civilization, unlike the other races, which were governed\nonly by the law of repulsion. Once civilization is established,\nhowever, further race mixing leads to the degeneration of the race\nthrough a decline in the quality of its blood. Consequently, when the\nwhite race conquers other Black or yellow races, any further\nintermingling will lead it to decline. Thus, Gobineau claimed that the\nwhite race would never die so long as its blood remains composed of\nits initial mixture of peoples. Notably, Nott strategically excised\nthose sections discussing the law of attraction when translating\nGobineau’s essay for an American audience (Bernasconi and Lott\n2000, 45–51). \nEventually, polygenesis declined through the intellectual success of\nCharles Darwin’s theory of evolution (Brace 2005, 124). Darwin\nhimself weighed in on this debate in the chapter “On the Races\nof Man” in his book The Descent of Man (1871),\narguing that as the theory of evolution gains wider acceptance,\n“the dispute between the monogenists and the polygenists will\ndie a silent and unobserved death” (Bernasconi and Lott 2000,\n68), with the former winning out. The rest of the essay entertained\nboth sides of the debate regarding whether or not different races\nconstitute different species or sub-species of humans. Although Darwin\ndid not explicitly take sides in this debate, the preponderance of his\nargument gives little support to the idea of races being different\nspecies. For instance, he noted that couples from different races\nproduce fertile offspring, and that individuals from different races\nseem to share many mental similarities. That said, while Darwinian\nevolution may have killed off polygenesis and the related idea that\nthe races constituted distinct species, it hardly killed off race\nitself. Darwin himself did not think natural selection would by itself\ngenerate racial distinctions, since the physical traits associated\nwith racial differences did not seem sufficiently beneficial to favor\ntheir retention; he did, however, leave open a role for sexual\nselection in the creation of races, through repeated mating among\nindividuals with similar traits (Bernasconi and Lott 2000,\n77–78). Consequently, later race thinkers would replace\npolygenesis with natural selection and sexual selection as scientific\nmechanisms whereby racial differentiation could slowly,\nunintentionally, but nevertheless inevitably proceed (Hannaford 1996,\n273). \nSexual selection became a central focus for race-thinking with the\nintroduction of the term “eugenics” in 1883 by Francis\nGalton (1822–1911) in his essay “Inquiries into Human\nFaculty and Development” (Hannaford 1996, 290). Focusing on\nphysical as opposed to “moral” qualities, Galton advocated\nselective breeding to improve the “health, energy, ability,\nmanliness, and courteous disposition” of the human species in\nhis later essay “Eugenics: Its Definition, Scope, and\nAims” (Bernasconi and Lott 2000, 80). Following the same\ncurrents of “Social Darwinism” that advocated the\nevolutionary improvement of the human condition through active human\nintervention, Galton proposed making eugenics not only an element in\npopular culture or “a new religion” (Bernasconi and Lott\n2000, 82) but even a policy enforced by the American government. While\npositive eugenics, or the enforced breeding of higher types, never\nbecame law, negative eugenics, or the sterilization of the\nfeebleminded or infirm, did become public policy enforced by a number\nof American states and upheld by the United States Supreme Court in an\neight-to-one decision in Buck v. Bell (274 U.S. 200, 1927).\nThe widespread acceptance of negative eugenics can be inferred by the\nfact that the Court Opinion justifying the decision was authored by\nJustice Oliver Wendell Holmes, a figure usually associated with\nprogressive and civil libertarian positions, and whose doctrine of\n“clear and present danger” sought to expand the protection\nof free speech. \nThe apogee of post-Darwinian race-thinking was arguably reached in the\nbook The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century by Houston\nStewart Chamberlain (1855–1927), the son-in-law of German opera\ncomposer Richard Wagner. Chamberlain argued in the evolutionary terms\nof sexual selection that distinct races emerged through geographical\nand historical conditions which create inbreeding among certain\nindividuals with similar traits (Hannaford 1996, 351). Moving from\nthis initial specification, Chamberlain then argued that the key\nstrands of western civilization—Christianity and ancient Greek\nphilosophy and art—emerged from the Aryan race. Jesus, for\ninstance, was held to be of Aryan stock, despite his Jewish religion,\nsince the territory of Galilee was populated by peoples descended from\nAryan Phonecians as well as by Semitic Jews. Similarly,\nAristotle’s distinction between Greeks and Barbarians was\nreinterpreted as a racial distinction between Aryans and non-Aryans.\nThese Greek and Christian strands became united in Europe,\nparticularly during the Reformation, which allowed the highest,\nTeutonic strain of the Aryan race to be freed from constraining Roman\nCatholic cultural fetters. But while Roman institutions and practices\nmay have constrained the Teutonic Germans, their diametric opposite\nwas the Jew, the highest manifestation of the Semitic Race. The\nEuropean religious tensions between Christian and Jew were thus\ntransformed into racial conflicts, for which conversion or ecumenical\ntolerance would have no healing effect. Chamberlain’s writings,\nnot surprisingly, have come to be seen as some of the key intellectual\nfoundations for twentieth century German anti-Semitism, of which Adolf\nHitler was simply its most extreme manifestation. \nIf Chamberlain’s writings served as intellectual fodder for\nGerman racial prejudice, Madison Grant (1865–1937) provided\nsimilar foundations for American race prejudice against Black people and\nNative Americans in his popular book The Passing of the Great\nRace (1916). Rejecting political or educational means of\nameliorating the destitution of the subordinate racial groups in\nAmerica, Grant instead advocated strict segregation and the\nprohibition of miscegenation, or the interbreeding of members of\ndifferent races (Hannaford 1996, 358). Like Galton, Grant had similar\nsuccess in influencing American public policy, both through the\nimposition of racist restrictions on immigration at the federal level\nand through the enforcement of anti-miscegenation laws in thirty\nstates, until such prohibitions were finally overturned by the United\nStates Supreme Court in Loving v. Virginia (388 U.S. 1\n[1967]). \nIf the apogee of biological race was reached in the early twentieth\ncentury, its decline began at about the same time. While writers such\nas Chamberlain and Grant popularized and politicized biological\nconceptions of race hierarchy, academic anthropologists since\nBlumenbach gave the concept of race its scientific validity. But\nacademic anthropology also provided the first challenge to biological\nrace in the person of Columbia University professor Franz Boas\n(1858–1942), a German-born Jewish immigrant to the United\nStates. Boas challenged the fixed character of racial groups by taking\non one of the key fundaments to racial typology, cranium size. Boas\nshowed that this characteristic was profoundly affected by\nenvironmental factors, noting that American-born members of various\n“racial” types, such as Semitic Jews, tended to have\nlarger crania than their European-born parents, a result of\ndifferences in nourishment. From this he concluded that claims about\nracially differential mental capacities could similarly be reduced to\nsuch environmental factors. In so doing, Boas undermined one measure\nof racial distinction, and although he did not go so far as to reject\nentirely the concept of biological race itself, he strongly influenced\nanthropologists to shift their focus from putatively fixed biological\ncharacteristics to apparently mutable cultural factors in order to\nunderstand differences among human groups (Bernasconi and Lott 2000,\n84–88; Brace 2005, 167–169; Cornell and Hartmann 1998,\n42–43). \nA stronger anthropological rejection of the biological conception of\nrace was leveled by Ashley Montagu (1905–1999). Drawing on\ninsights from modern, experimental genetics, Montagu forcefully argued\nthat the anthropological conception of race relied on grouping\ntogether various perceptible physical characteristics, whereas the\nreal building blocks of evolution were genes, which dictated\nbiological changes among populations at a much finer level. The\nmorphological traits associated with race, thus, were gross aggregates\nof a variety of genetic changes, some of which resulted in physically\nperceptible characteristics, many others of which resulted in\nimperceptible changes. Moreover, since genetic evolution can occur\nthrough both the mixture of different genes and the mutation of the\nsame gene over generations, the traits associated with races cannot be\nattributed to discrete lines of genetic descent, since the dark skin\nand curly hair of one individual may result from genetic mixture while\nthe same traits in another individual may result from genetic mutation\n(Bernasconi and Lott 2000, 100–107). Montagu’s efforts\neventually resulted in the publication of an official statement\ndenying the biological foundations of race by the United Nations\nEducational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1950,\nalthough it would take until 1996 for the American Association of\nPhysical Anthropologists (AAPA) to publish a similar document (Brace\n2005, 239). \nRon Mallon (2004, 2006, 2007) provides a nice sketch of the\ncontemporary philosophical terrain regarding the status of the concept\nof race, dividing it into three valid competing schools of thought\nregarding the ontological status of race, along with the discarded\nbiological conception. Racial naturalism signifies the old,\nbiological conception of race, which depicts races as bearing\n“biobehavioral essences: underlying natural (and perhaps\ngenetic) properties that (1) are heritable, biological features, (2)\nare shared by all and only the members of a race, and (3) explain\nbehavioral, characterological, and cultural predispositions of\nindividual persons and racial groups” (2006, 528–529).\nWhile philosophers and scientists have reached the consensus against\nracial naturalism, philosophers nevertheless disagree on the possible\nontological status of a different conception of race. Mallon divides\nsuch disagreements into three metaphysical camps (racial\nskepticism, racial constructivism, and racial\npopulation naturalism) and two normative camps\n(eliminativism and conservationism). We have used\n‘constructivism’ throughout for the sake of consistency\nbut it should be read as interchangeable with\n‘constructionism.’ \nRacial skepticism holds that because racial naturalism is\nfalse, races of any type do not exist. Racial skeptics, such as\nAnthony Appiah (1995, 1996) and Naomi Zack (1993, 2002) contend that\nthe term race cannot refer to anything real in the world, since the\none thing in the world to which the term could uniquely\nrefer—discrete, essentialist, biological races—have been\nproven not to exist. Zack (2002, 87–88) provides an accessible\nsummary of the racial skeptic’s argument against the biological\nfoundations for race, sequentially summarizing the scientific\nrejection of essences, geography, phenotypes, post-Mendelian\ntransmission genetics, and genealogies as possible foundations for\nraces. Aristotelian essences, thought to ground the common\ncharacteristics of distinct species, were correctly rejected by early\nmodern philosophers. If essences cannot even ground differences among\nspecies, then they clearly cannot ground the differences among races,\nwhich even nineteenth century racial science still understood as\nmembers of the same species. Whereas folk theories rely\non geography to divide humanity into African, European,\nAsian, and Amerindian races, contemporary population genetics reveal\nthe vacuity of this foundation for two reasons. First, geographically\nbased environmental stimuli lead to continuous physical adaptations in\nskin, hair and bone rather than the discrete differences associated\nwith race; and second, although mitochondrial DNA mutations provide\nevidence of the geographical origins of populations, these mutations\ndo not correlate with the physical traits associated with racial\ngroups. Similarly, phenotypes cannot ground folk theories\nof race: for instance, differences in skin tone are gradual, not\ndiscrete; and blood-type variations occur independently of the more\nvisible phenotypes associated with race, such as skin color and hair\ntexture. Race cannot be founded upon transmission genetics,\nsince the genes transmitted from one generation to the next lead to\nvery specific physical traits, not general racial characteristics\nshared by all members of a putatively racial group. And\nfinally, genealogy cannot ground race, since clades\n(populations descended from a common ancestor) may have common genetic\ncharacteristics, but these need not correlate with the visible traits\nassociated with races. Zack concludes: “Essences, geography,\nphenotypes, genotypes, and genealogy are the only known candidates for\nphysical scientific bases of race. Each fails. Therefore, there is no\nphysical scientific basis for the social racial taxonomy” (Zack\n2002, 88). \nRacial skeptics like Appiah and Zack adopt normative\nracial eliminativism, which recommends discarding the\nconcept of race entirely, according to the following argument. Because\nof its historical genealogy, the term race can only refer to one or\nmore discrete groups of people who alone share biologically\nsignificant genetic features. Such a monopoly on certain genetic\nfeatures could only emerge within a group that practices such a high\nlevel of inbreeding that it is effectively genetically isolated. Such\ngenetic isolation might refer to the Amish in America (Appiah 1996,\n73) or to Irish Protestants (Zack 2002, 69), but they clearly cannot\nrefer to those groupings of people presently subsumed under American\nracial census categories. Because the concept “race” can\nonly apply to groups not typically deemed races (Amish, Irish\nProtestants), and because this concept cannot apply to groups\ntypically deemed races (African Americans, Whites, Asians, Native\nAmericans), a mismatch occurs between the concept and its typical\nreferent. Thus, the concept of race must be eliminated due to its\nlogical incoherence (Mallon 2006, 526, 533). \nAppiah has since modified his skepticism in such a way that softens\nthe eliminitivist element of his position. Appiah has come to argue\nfor racial nominalism by admitting the importance of\n“human folk races,” namely, that they are forms of social\nidentity that do in fact exist (2006, 367). The way in which they are\nsocial identities, however, is a problem because we treat them as if\nthere were some biological underpinning to them (2006, 367). The folk\ntheory of race, then, is false because it is based on mistaken\nbeliefs, yet it is nonetheless true that we continue to categorize\npeople along its lines. Appiah’s nominalist view of race aims to\nreveal how these social identities work by analyzing the labels we use\nfor them. According to Appiah there are three ways that we categorize\nusing folk racial labels: ascription, identification, and treatment,\nand it takes all three for a given label to be a functioning social\nidentity (2006, 368–370). As a result, we come to live as these\nidentities and look to them as a central resource for constructing our\nlives. Furthermore, norms of identification and authenticity arise\naround them (2006, 372). Since there is no biological story that can\nbe told to ground these labels then race is not real (2006, 372). For\na critique of Appiah’s modified view that focuses on Appiah\n(1996) see Ronald R. Sundstrom (2002). \nRacial constructivism refers to the argument that, even if\nbiological race is false, races have come into existence and continue\nto exist through “human culture and human decisions”\n(Mallon 2007, 94). Race constructivists accept the skeptics’\ndismissal of biological race but argue that the term still\nmeaningfully refers to the widespread grouping of individuals into\ncertain categories by society, indeed often by the very members of\nsuch racial ascriptions. Normatively, race constructivists argue that\nsince society labels people according to racial categories, and since\nsuch labeling often leads to race-based differences in resources,\nopportunities, and well-being, the concept of race must be conserved,\nin order to facilitate race-based social movements or policies, such\nas affirmative action, that compensate for socially constructed but\nsocially relevant racial differences. While sharing this normative\ncommitment to race conservationism, racial constructivists\ncan be subdivided into three groups with slightly different accounts\nof the ontology of race. As we will see below, however, Sally\nHaslanger’s eliminitivist constructivism illustrates how these\ncommitments can come apart. \nThin constructivism depicts race as a grouping of humans\naccording to ancestry and genetically insignificant,\n“superficial properties that are prototypically linked with\nrace,” such as skin tone, hair color and hair texture (Mallon\n2006, 534). In this way, thin constructivists such as Robert\nGooding-Williams (1998), Lucius Outlaw (1990, 1996) and Charles Mills\n(1998) rely on the widespread folk theory of race while rejecting its\nscientific foundation upon racial naturalism. Interactive kind\nconstructivism goes further, in arguing that being ascribed to a\ncertain racial category causes the individuals so labeled to have\ncertain common experiences (Mallon 2006, 535; Piper 1992). For\ninstance, if society ascribes you as black, you are likely to\nexperience difficulty hailing cabs in New York or are more likely to\nbe apprehended without cause by the police (James 2004, 17).\nFinally, institutional constructivism emphasizes race as a\nsocial institution, whose character is specific to the society in\nwhich it is embedded and thus cannot be applied across cultures or\nhistorical epochs (Mallon 2006, 536). Michael Root (2000, 632) notes\nthat a person ascribed as Black in the United States would likely not\nbe considered Black in Brazil, since each country has very different\nsocial institutions regarding the division of humanity into distinct\nraces. Similarly, Paul Taylor (2000) responds to Appiah’s racial\nskepticism by holding that races, even if biologically unreal, remain\nreal social objects (Mallon 2006, 536–537). Indeed, in a later\nwork Taylor (2004) argues that the term “race” has a\nperfectly clear referent, that being those people socially ascribed to\ncertain racial categories within the United States, regardless of the\nwidespread social rejection of biological racial naturalism. \nSally Haslanger’s constructivism (2000, 2010, 2019) is not,\nhowever, conservationist. She understands races as racialized groups,\nwhose membership requires three criteria. One, members are those who\nare “observed or imagined” to have certain bodily features\nthat are evidence of certain ancestry from certain geographical\nlocations; two, “having (or being imagined to have)” those\nfeatures marks members as occupying either a subordinate or privileged\nsocial position, thereby justifying that position; and three, the\nsatisfaction of the first two criteria plays a role in members’\nsystemic subordination or privilege (2019, 25–26). Racial\nidentity in such contexts need not focus exclusively on subordination\nor privilege, as “many forms of racial identity are important,\nvaluable, and in some cases even inevitable responses to racial\nhierarchy” (2019, 29–30). She worries, however, that even\nthough we should embrace “cultural groups marked by ancestry and\nappearance” in the short term to fight for justice, she worries\nabout embracing them for the long term (2019, 30). \nConstructivism also cleaves along political and cultural dimensions, a\ndistinction owed to Chike Jeffers (Jeffers, 2013, 2019).\nHaslanger’s view is paradigmatic of political constructivism by\nunderstanding the meaning of race as determined by hierarchical\nrelations of power by definition: “race is made real\nwholly or most importantly by hierarchical relations of power”\n(Jeffers 2019, 48). Jeffers’ cultural constructivism corrects for\npolitical constructivism’s inability to account for race\nexisting after racism, including the idea of racial equality (2013,\n421; 2019, 71). Cultural constructivism rejects “the idea that\ncultural difference is less important than differences in power\nrelations for understanding racial phenomena in the present”\n(2019, 65). At the extreme, political constructivism argues for, one,\ndifferential power relations bring racial difference into existence;\ntwo, differential power relations are fundamental for understanding\nthe present reality of race; and three, differential power relations\nare essential to race, so race will cease to exist in an egalitarian\nsociety where appearance and ancestry do not correlate to certain\nhierarchical positions (2019, 56–57). Jeffers concedes\nrace’s political origin while rejecting the two other ways that\npower relations define race (2013, 419; 2019, 57–58). The\ncultural significance of race can be seen in three ways. First, even\nthe emergence of racial categories counts as a cultural shift, insofar\nas new social contexts are created in which those viewed as being of\ndifferent races are also viewed as having different cultures. Second,\nthere are “novel forms of cultural difference” that emerge\nin the wake of racial difference. And third, racial groups are shaped\nculturally by happenings prior to racial formation (2019,\n62–63). Jeffers thus writes of Blackness, “What it means\nto be a Black person, for many of us, including myself, can never be\nexhausted through reference to problems of stigmatization,\ndiscrimination, marginalization, and disadvantage, as real and as\nlarge-looming as these factors are in the racial landscape as we know\nit. There is also joy in blackness, a joy shaped by culturally\ndistinctive situations” (2013, 422). \nThere are also views that challenge the broad strokes of\nconstructivism while avoiding racial skepticism: Lionel K.\nMcPherson’s deflationary pluralism (2015), Joshua\nGlasgow’s basic racial realism (2015, with Jonathan M. Woodward,\n2019), and Michael O. Hardimon’s deflationary realism (2003,\n2014, 2017). McPherson argues that “race” should be\nreplaced with his concept of socioancestry, since\n“‘race’ talk overall is too ambiguous and contested\nto be salvaged in the search for a dominant understanding”\n(2015, 676). He aims to sidestep Appiah’s eliminativism by\nclaiming that deflationary pluralism “does not maintain that\n‘race’ talk is necessarily an error and does not take a\nhard line about whether races exist” (2015, 675). Socioancestry\nretains the possibility of “color-conscious social identity”\nwithout the burdens of assumptions or confusions about race and racial\nnature (2015, 686). This is because it is “visible continental\nancestry,” rather than race, which is the root of\ncolor-consciousness (2015, 690). Socioancestry, then, focuses on\nvisible continental ancestry alone to explain social group formation.\nAccordingly, socioancestral identities develop “when persons\naccept (or are ascribed) a social identity because they share a\ncomponent of continental ancestry that distinctively shapes\ncolor-conscious social reality” (2015, 690). \nGlasgow’s basic racial realism aims to capture our operative\nmeaning of race: “the meaning that governs our use of the term,\neven when we are unaware of it” (2019, 115). Glasgow defines his\nposition in the following way: “Races, by definition, are\nrelatively large groups of people who are distinguished from other\ngroups of people by having certain visible biological traits (such as\nskin color) to a disproportionate extent.” The position is\ntherefore anti-realist, since it claims that races are neither\nbiologically nor socially real (2019, 117). Glasgow’s position\nis grounded in judgments about our commitments, believing that we are\nmore willing to give up on the biological basis for race than we are\nto give up on the idea that there are certain “core features and\nidentities” connected to the idea of race” (2019, 127). In\nother words, disbelieving in the biological reality of race doesn’t\nlead to eliminativism. Glasgow holds, however, that it also doesn’t\nlead to social constructivism. Race is not socially made because,\n“no matter which social facts we attend to, we can always\nimagine them disappearing while race stays. And if race is\nconceptually able to persist across all social practices, then by\ndefinition it is not a social phenomenon” (2019, 133). This\nintuition is based in his focus on our ordinary usage of the term\n“race,” which is fully captured by visible traits. \nHardimon’s deflationary realism argues that we need four\ninterrelated race concepts to coherently answer the question of what\nrace is to human beings: the racialist concept of race, the minimalist\nconcept of race, the populationist concept of race, and the concept of\nsocialrace (2017, 2–3, 7). The racialist concept of race is the\nview that there are fixed patterns of race-based moral, intellectual,\nand cultural characteristics that are heritable, based in an\nunderlying biological essence, correlate to physical characteristics,\nand form a distinct racial hierarchy (2017, 15–16). Minimalist\nrace “says that people differ in shape and color in ways that\ncorrespond to differences in their geographical ancestry. Essentially\nthat is all it says” (2017, 6; see also 2003). It aims to\ncapture in “a nonmalefic way” what the racialist concept\nof race says that it captures. In other words, it admits of the\nnonsocial and biological reality of race but in a value-neutral way\n(2017, 7). Populationist race aims to do the same thing in a more\nrobust and specific way by giving a genetic underpinning to the\nminimalist conception based on a “geographically separated and\nreproductively isolated founding population” (2017, 99). This\nconcept is distinguished from cladistic race because it does not\nrequire monophyly (2017, 110). Finally, socialrace captures race in\nterms of its social relations and practices. It refers to “the\nsocial groups in racist societies that appear to be racialist races as\nsocial groups that falsely appear to be biological groups”\n(2017, 10; see also 2014). Hardimon argues that it is only through\nusing all four concepts, with the rejection of the first being the\nbasis for the construction of the latter three, that we can actually\nunderstand our concept of race. \nThe third school of thought regarding the ontology of race\nis racial population naturalism. This camp suggests that,\nalthough racial naturalism falsely attributed cultural, mental, and\nphysical characters to discrete racial groups, it is possible that\ngenetically significant biological groupings could exist that would\nmerit the term races. Importantly, these biological racial groupings\nwould not be essentialist or discrete: there is no set of genetic or\nother biological traits that all and only all members of a racial\ngroup share that would then provide a natural biological boundary\nbetween racial groups. Thus, these thinkers confirm the strong\nscientific consensus that discrete, essentialist races do not exist.\nHowever, the criteria of discreteness and essentialism would also\ninvalidate distinctions between non-human species, such as lions and\ntigers. As Philip Kitcher puts it, “there is no…genetic\nfeature…that separates one species of mosquito or mushroom from\nanother” (Kitcher 2007, 294–296; Cf. Mallon 2007,\n146–168). Rather, biological species are differentiated by\nreproductive isolation, which is relative, not absolute (since hybrids\nsometimes appear in nature); which may have non-genetic causes (e.g.,\ngeographic separation and incompatible reproduction periods or\nrituals); which may generate statistically significant if not uniform\ngenetic differences; and which may express distinct phenotypes. In\neffect, if the failure to satisfy the condition of discreteness and\nessentialism requires jettisoning the concept of race, then it also\nrequires jettisoning the concept of biological species. But because\nthe biological species concept remains epistemologically useful, some\nbiologists and philosophers use it to defend a racial ontology that is\n“biologically informed but non-essentialist,” one that is\nvague, non-discrete, and related to genetics, genealogy, geography,\nand phenotype (Sesardic 2010, 146). \nThere are three versions of racial population naturalism: cladistic\nrace; socially isolated race; and genetically clustered\nrace. Cladistic races are “ancestor-descendant\nsequences of breeding populations that share a common origin”\n(Andreasen 2004, 425). They emerged during human evolution, as\ndifferent groups of humans became geographically isolated from each\nother, and may be dying out, if they have not already, due to more\nrecent human reproductive intermingling (Andreasen 1998,\n214–216; Cf. Andreasen 2000, S653–S666). Socially\nisolated race refers to the fact that legal sanctions against\nmiscegenation might have created a genetically isolated African\nAmerican race in the USA (Kitcher 1999). Finally, defenders\nof genetically clustered race argue that although only 7%\nof the differences between any two individuals regarding any one\nspecific gene can be attributed to their membership in one of the\ncommonly recognized racial categories, the aggregation of several\ngenes is statistically related to a small number of racial categories\nassociated with major geographic regions and phenotypes (Sesardic\n2010; Kitcher 2007, 304). \nThe question is whether these new biological ontologies of race avoid\nthe conceptual mismatches that ground eliminativism. The short answer\nis that they can, but only through human intervention. Socially\nisolated race faces no mismatch when applied to African Americans,\ndefined as the descendants of African slaves brought to the United\nStates. However, this racial category would not encompass Black\nAfricans. Moreover, because African American race originated in\nlegally enforced sexual segregation, it is “both biologically\nreal and socially constructed” (Kitcher 2007, 298). Genetic\nclustering would seem to provide an objective, biological foundation\nfor a broader racial taxonomy, but differences in clustered genes are\ncontinuous, not discrete, and thus scientists must decide where to\ndraw the line between one genetically clustered race and another. If\nthey program their computers to distinguish four genetic clusters,\nthen European, Asian, Amerindian, and African groups will emerge; if\nonly two clusters are sought, then only the African and Amerindian\n“races” remain (Kitcher 2007, 304). Thus, genetic\nclustering avoids racial mismatch only through the decisions of the\nscientist analyzing the data. The same problem also confronts\ncladistic race, since the number of races will vary from nine, at the\nmost recent period of evolutionary reproductive isolation, to just\none, if we go back to the very beginning, since all humans were\noriginally Africans. But in addition, cladistic race faces a stronger\nmismatch by “cross-classifying” groups that we typically\nthink of as part of the same race, for example by linking northeast\nAsians more closely with Europeans than with more phenotypically\nsimilar southeast Asians. Robin Andreasen defends the cladistic race\nconcept by correctly arguing that folk theories of race have\nthemselves generated counter-intuitive cross-classifications,\nparticularly with respect to the Census’ Asian category, which\npreviously excluded Asian Indians and now excludes native Hawaiians\nand Pacific Islanders. (Andreasen 2005, 100–101; Andreasen 2004,\n430–431; Cf. Glasgow 2003, 456–474; Glasgow 2009,\n91–108). But this hardly saves her argument, since the US\nCensus’s history of shifting racial categories and past use of\nethnic and religious terms (e.g., Filipino, Hindu, and Korean) to\nsignify races is typically taken as evidence of the social,\nrather than biological, foundations of race (Espiritu 1992, Chapter\n5). \nQuayshawn Spencer (2012, 2014, 2019) is resistant to arguments that\ncladistic subspecies are a viable biological candidate for race (2012,\n203). Instead, he defends a version of biological racial realism that\nunderstands “biologically real” as capturing “all of\nthe entities that are used in empirically successful\nbiology…and that adequately rules out all of the entities that\nare not” (2019, 77; see also 95). Spencer argues that such an\nentity exists and can be found in the US government’s Office of\nManagement and Budget (OMB) and its racial classifications. The basis\nfor this claim is that population genetics has identified five\ndistinctive “human continental populations” that satisfy\nthe criteria for biological reality (2019, 98; 95). The OMB\nclassifications map onto these continental populations. The importance\nof the OMB is that its ubiquity in our lives means that one of the\nprimary ways that we talk about race is through its categories.\nSpencer highlights this centrality when he points out the ways that\nAmericans self-report their races correspond to the parameters of the\nOMB classifications (2019, 83–85). Spencer is pluralist about\nrace talk, however, meaning that OMB race is just one dominant meaning\nof race, while there is no single dominant meaning among users of the\nterm (2019, 213). \nIn each case, racial population naturalism encounters problems in\ntrying to demarcate discrete boundaries between different biological\npopulations. If discreteness is indispensable to a human racial\ntaxonomy, then mismatches can only be avoided, if at all, through\nhuman intervention. But as noted above, biological species are also\nnot genetically discrete, and thus boundaries between non-human\nspecies must also be imposed through human intervention. And just as\nthe demarcation of non-human species is justified through its\nscientific usefulness, so too are human racial categories justified.\nFor instance, Andreason contends that a cladistic race concept that\ndivides northeastern from southeastern Asians is scientifically useful\nfor evolutionary research, even if it conflicts with the folk concept\nof a unified Asian race. In turn, the concepts of genetically\nclustered and socially isolated race may remain useful for detecting\nand treating some health problems. Ian Hacking provides a careful\nargument in favor of the provisional use of American racial categories\nin medicine. Noting that racial categories do not reflect\nessentialist, uniform differences, he reiterates the finding that\nthere are statistically significant genetic differences among\ndifferent racial groups. As a result, an African American is more\nlikely to find a bone marrow match from a pool of African American\ndonors than from a pool of white donors. Thus, he defends the practice\nof soliciting African American bone marrow donors, even though this\nmay provide fodder to racist groups who defend an essentialist and\nhierarchical conception of biological race (Hacking 2005,\n102–116; Cf. Kitcher 2007, 312–316). Conversely, Dorothy\nRoberts emphasizes the dangers of using racial categories within\nmedicine, suggesting that it not only validates egregious ideas of\nbiological racial hierarchy but also contributes to conservative\njustifications for limiting race-based affirmative action and even\nsocial welfare funding, which supposedly would be wasted on\ngenetically inferior minority populations. In effect, race-based\nmedicine raises the specter of a new political synthesis of colorblind\nconservatism with biological racialism (Roberts 2008, 537–545).\nHowever, Roberts’ critique fails to engage the literature on the\nstatistical significance of racial categories for genetic differences.\nMoreover, she herself acknowledges that many versions of colorblind\nconservatism do not rely at all on biological justifications. \nStephen Cornell and Douglas Hartmann (1998) provide a helpful\ndiscussion of the differences between the concepts of race and\nethnicity. Relying on social constructivism, they define race as\n“a human group defined by itself or others as distinct by virtue\nof perceived common physical characteristics that are held to be\ninherent…Determining which characteristics constitute the\nrace…is a choice human beings make. Neither markers nor\ncategories are predetermined by any biological factors” (Cornell\nand Hartmann 1998, 24). Ethnicity, conversely, is defined as a sense\nof common ancestry based on cultural attachments, past linguistic\nheritage, religious affiliations, claimed kinship, or some physical\ntraits (1998, 19). Racial identities are typically thought of as\nencompassing multiple ethnic identities (Cornell and Hartmann 1998,\n26). Thus, people who are racially categorized as black may possess a\nvariety of ethnic identities based either on African national or\ncultural markers (e.g., Kenyan, Igbo, Zulu) or the newer national,\nsub-national, or trans-national identities created through the mixing\nof enslaved populations in the Americas (e.g., African American,\nHaitian, West Indian). \nCornell and Hartmann outline five additional characteristics that\ndistinguish race from ethnicity: racial identity is typically\nexternally imposed by outsiders, as when whites created the Negro race\nto homogenize the multiple ethnic groups they conquered in Africa or\nbrought as slaves to America; race is a result of early globalization,\nwhen European explorers “discovered” and then conquered\npeoples with radically different phenotypical traits; race typically\ninvolves power relations, from the basic power to define the race of\nothers to the more expansive power to deprive certain racial groups of\nsocial, economic, or political benefits; racial identities are\ntypically hierarchical, with certain races being perceived as superior\nto others; and racial identity is perceived as inherent, something\nindividuals are born with (1998, 27–29). \nRace and ethnicity differ strongly in the level of agency that\nindividuals exercise in choosing their identity. Individuals rarely\nhave any choice over their racial identity, due to the immediate\nvisual impact of the physical traits associated with race. Individuals\nare thought to exercise more choice over ethnic identification, since\nthe physical differences between ethnic groups are typically less\nstriking, and since individuals can choose whether or not to express\nthe cultural practices associated with ethnicity. So an individual who\nphenotypically appears white with ancestors from Ireland can more\nreadily choose whether to assert their Irish identity (by celebrating\nSt. Patrick’s Day) than whether to choose their white identity\n(Cornell and Hartmann 1998, 29–30). Moreover, Mary Waters (1990)\nargues that the high level of intermarriage among white Americans from\nvarious national ancestries grants their children significant\n“ethnic options” in choosing with which of their multiple\nheritages to identify. Waters (1999) and Philip Kasinitz (1992)\ndocument how phenotypically black West Indian immigrants exercise\nagency in asserting their ethnic identity in order to differentiate\nthemselves from native-born African Americans, but discrimination and\nviolence aimed at all Black people, regardless of ethnicity, strongly\nconstrains such agency.The greater constraints on racial identity stem\nfrom the role of informal perceptions, discriminatory social action,\nand formal laws imposing racial identity, such as Census\ncategorization (Nobles 2000), the infamous “hypodescent”\nlaws, which defined people as black if they had one drop of African\nblood (Davis 1991), and judicial decisions such as the\n“prerequisite cases,” which determined whether specific\nimmigrants could be classified as white and thus eligible for\nnaturalized citizenship (Lopez 1996).  \nThe line between race and ethnicity gets blurred in the case of Asians\nand Latinos in the United States. Yen Le Espiritu (1992) notes that\nAsian American racial identity, which of course encompasses a\nremarkable level of ethnic diversity, results from a combination of\nexternal assignment and agency, as when Asians actively respond to\nanti-Asian discrimination or violence through political action and a\nsense of shared fate. Consequently, Espiritu uses the term\n“panethnicity” to describe Asian American identity, a\nconcept which has racial connotations, given the role of “racial\nlumping” together of members of diverse Asian ethnicities into a\nsingle racial group defined by phenotypical traits. Thus, she declares\nthat “African Americans [are] the earliest and most developed\npan-ethnic group in the United States” (1992, 174). Hispanic or\nLatino identity exhibits traits similar to pan-ethnicity. Indeed,\nunlike Asian identity, Hispanic identity is not even a formal racial\nidentity under the Census. However, informal perceptions, formal laws,\nand discrimination based on physical appearance nevertheless tend to\nlump together various nationalities and ethnicities that share some\nconnection to Latin America (Rodriquez 2000). Moreover, scholars have\nnoted that Jews (Brodkin 1998) and the Irish (Ignatiev 1995) were once\nwere considered distinct, non-white races but are now considered to be\nracially white ethnic groups, partly by exercising agency in\ndistancing themselves from African Americans exercising political\npower. Thus, it is conceivable that groups today considered to be\nsociological racial groups could transform into something more like an\nethnic group. For this reason, Blum describes Hispanics and Asians as\nincompletely racialized groups (Blum 2002, 149–155). \nA robust philosophical debate has emerged regarding the status of\nHispanic or Latino identity. Jorge Gracia (2000) defends the utility\nof Hispanic ethnic identity as grounded primarily in the shared,\nlinguistic culture that can be traced to the Iberian Peninsula. Jorge\nGarcia (2001, 2006) challenges this approach, arguing that the\ndiversity of individual experiences undermines the use of Hispanic\nethnicity as a meaningful form of collective identity. Linda Martin\nAlcoff (2006) develops a “realist” defense of Latino\nidentity against charges of essentialism and views it as a category of\nsolidarity that develops in reaction to white privilege. Christina\nBeltran (2010), on the other hand, does not try to paper over the\ndiversity within Latinidad, which she instead portrays as a\npluralistic, fragmented, and agonistic form of political action.  \nTwo strands in moral, political, and legal philosophy are pertinent to\nthe concept of race. One strand examines the broader conceptual and\nmethodological questions regarding the moral status of race and how to\ntheorize racial justice; the other strand normatively assesses\nspecific policies or institutional forms that seek to redress racial\ninequality, such as affirmative action, racially descriptive\nrepresentation, the general question of colorblindness in law and\npolicy, residential racial segregation, and racism in the criminal\njustice system and policing. \nLawrence Blum, Anthony Appiah, and Tommie Shelby articulate\nindispensable positions in addressing the moral status of the concept\nof race. Blum (2002) examines both the concept of race and the problem\nof racism. He argues that “racism” be restricted to two\nreferents: inferiorization, or the denigration of a group due\nto its putative biological inferiority; and antipathy, or the\n“bigotry, hostility, and hatred” towards another group\ndefined by its putatively inherited physical traits (2002, 8). These\ntwo moral sins deserve this heightened level of condemnation\nassociated with the term racism, because they violate moral norms of\n“respect, equality, and dignity” and because they are\nhistorically connected to extreme and overt forms of racial oppression\n(2002, 27). But because these connections make “racism” so\nmorally loaded a term, it should not be applied to “lesser\nracial ills and infractions” that suggest mere ignorance,\ninsensitivity or discomfort regarding members of different groups\n(28), since doing so will apply a disproportionate judgment against\nthe person so named, closing off possible avenues for fruitful moral\ndialogue. \nDue to the historical connection between racism and extreme\noppression, Blum argues against using the term race, since he rejects\nits biological foundation. Instead, he advocates using the term\n“racialized group” to denote those socially constructed\nidentities whose supposedly inherited common physical traits are used\nto impose social, political, and economic costs. To Blum,\n“racialized group” creates distance from the biological\nconception of race and it admits of degrees, as in the case of\nLatinos, whom Blum describes as an “incompletely racialized\ngroup” (2002, 151). This terminological shift, and its supposed\nrevelation of the socially constructed character of physiognomically\ndefined identities, need not require the rejection of group-specific\npolicies such as affirmative action. Members of sociologically\nconstructed racialized identities suffer real harms, and laws might\nhave to distinguish individuals according to their racialized\nidentities in order to compensate for such harms. Nevertheless, Blum\nremains ambivalent about such measures, arguing that even when\nnecessary they remain morally suspect (2002, 97). \nSimilar ambivalence is also expressed by Anthony Appiah, earlier\ndiscussed regarding the metaphysics of race. While his metaphysical\nracial skepticism was cited as grounding his normative\nposition of eliminativism, Appiah is “against\nraces” but “for racial identities” (1996). Because\nof a wide social consensus that races exist, individuals are ascribed\nto races regardless of their individual choices or desires. Moreover,\nracial identity remains far more salient and costly than ethnic\nidentity (1996, 80–81). As a result, mobilization along racial\nlines is justifiable, in order to combat racism. But even at this\npoint, Appiah still fears that racial identification may constrain\nindividual autonomy by requiring members of racial groups to behave\naccording to certain cultural norms or “scripts” that have\nbecome dominant within a specific racial group. Appiah thus concludes,\n“Racial identity can be the basis of resistance to racism; but\neven as we struggle against racism…let us not let our racial\nidentities subject us to new tyrannies” (1996, 104). This\nresidual ambivalence, to recall the metaphysical discussions of the\nlast section, perhaps ground Mallon’s contention that Appiah\nremains an eliminativist rather than a racial\nconstructivist, since ideally Appiah would prefer to be free of\nall residual constraints entailed by even socially constructed\nraces. \nTommie Shelby responds to the ambivalence of Appiah and Blum by\ndistinguishing classical black nationalism, which rested upon\nan organic black identity, with pragmatic black nationalism,\nbased on an instrumental concern with combating antiblack racism\n(2005, 38–52; 2003, 666–668). Pragmatic nationalism allows\nBlack people to generate solidarity across class or cultural lines, not just\nthrough the modus vivendi of shared interests but upon a\nprincipled commitment to racial equality and justice (2005,\n150–154). As a result, black solidarity is grounded upon a\nprincipled response to common oppression, rather than some putative\nshared identity (2002), thus mitigating the dangers of biological\nessentialism and tyrannical cultural conformity that Appiah associates\nwith race and racial identities. Anna Stubblefield (2005) provides an\nalternative defense of Black solidarity by comparing it to familial\ncommitments. \nShelby (2005, 7) briefly mentions that his pragmatic, political\nversion of black solidarity is compatible with John Rawls’s\nPolitical Liberalism, but his more detailed defense of the\nideal social contract method of Rawls’s A Theory of Justice\nfor theorizing racial justice has drawn substantial controversy\n(Shelby 2004). Elizabeth Anderson eschews ideal theory for analyzing\nracial justice because it assumes motivational and cognitive\ncapacities beyond those of ordinary humans; it risks promoting ideal\nnorms (like colorblindness) under unjust conditions that require\nrace-specific policies; and its idealizing assumptions, like an\noriginal position in which parties do not know relevant personal and\nsocial racial facts, precludes recognition of historical and present\nracial injustice. She instead uses a normative framework of democratic\nequality to ground her moral imperative of integration. \nCharles Mills, extending his critique of how early modern social\ncontract thinking obfuscates racial injustice (1997), fears that\nRawls’s ideal theory can similarly serve as an ideology that\nwhitewashes non-white oppression (Mills 2013). But rather than\njettisoning a contractarian approach entirely, Mills instead develops\na model of a non-ideal contract, in which the parties do not know\ntheir own racial identities but are aware of their society’s history\nof racial exploitation and its effects. Because the parties know of\nracial hierarchy but do not know if they will be its beneficiaries or\nvictims, Mills hypothesizes that they will rationally agree to racial\nreparations as a form of corrective or rectificatory justice (Pateman\nand Mills 2007, Chapters 3, 4, 8). \nShelby responds that, while Rawls’s ideal theory of justice excludes a\ntheory of rectification because it is not comprehensive, rectificatory\njustice is not only complementary but in fact presupposes an ideal\ntheory that can clarify when injustices have occurred and need to be\nrectified. More importantly, Shelby suggests that complying with\nrectificatory justice through racial reparations could well leave\nBlack people living in a society that nevertheless remains racially unjust\nin other ways. For this reason, Shelby concludes that ideal theory\nremains indispensable (2013). \nChristopher Lebron (2013, 28–42) also suggests that the\napproaches of Rawls and Mills are complementary, but in a very\ndifferent way. He argues that Rawls’s focus on the basic structure of\nsociety provides explanatory mechanisms through which white supremacy\npersists, something unspecified in earlier work by Mills (2003). And\nin sharp contrast to Shelby (2013), Lebron criticizes Mills for\nrehabilitating Rawlsian contract thinking, since even a non-ideal form\neliminates the epistemological advantage of a non-white perspective on\nwhite supremacy. Instead of reformulating contractarian thinking to\nfit the needs of racial justice, Lebron instead focuses on analyzing\nhow “historically evolved power” and “socially\nembedded power” perpetuate racial injustice. \nTurning to the second strand of practical philosophy devoted to race,\nvarious scholars have addressed policies such as affirmative action,\nrace-conscious electoral districting, and colorblindness in policy and\nlaw. The literature on affirmative action is immense, and may be\ndivided into approaches that focus on compensatory justice,\ndistributive justice, critiques of the concept of merit, and diversity\nof perspective. Alan Goldman (1979) generally argues against\naffirmative action, since jobs or educational opportunities as a rule\nshould go to those most qualified. Only when a specific individual has\nbeen victimized by racial or other discrimination can the otherwise\nirrelevant factor of race be used as a compensatory measure to award a\nposition or a seat at a university. Ronald Fiscus (1992) rejects the\ncompensatory scheme in favor of a distributive justice argument. He\nclaims that absent the insidious and invidious effects of a racist\nsociety, success in achieving admissions to selective universities or\nattractive jobs would be randomly distributed across racial lines.\nThus, he concludes that distributive justice requires the racially\nproportional distribution of jobs and university seats. Of course,\nFiscus’s argument displaces the role of merit in the awarding of\njobs or university admissions, but this point is addressed by Iris\nYoung (1990, Chapter 7), who argues that contemporary criteria of\nmerit, such as standardized testing and educational achievement, are\nbiased against disadvantaged racial and other groups, and rarely are\nfunctionally related to job performance or academic potential.\nFinally, Michel Rosenfeld (1991) turns away from substantive theories\nof justice in favor of a conception of justice as reversibility, a\nposition influenced by the “Discourse Ethics” of\nJürgen Habermas (1990), which defines justice not by the proper\nsubstantive awarding of goods but as the result of a fair discursive\nprocedure that includes all relevant viewpoints and is free of\ncoercive power relations. Thus, affirmative action is justified as an\nattempt to include racially diverse viewpoints. All of these positions\nare summarily discussed in a useful debate format in Cohen and Sterba\n(2003). \nThe issues of race-conscious electoral districting and descriptive\nracial representation have also garnered substantial attention.\nRace-conscious districting is the practice of drawing geographically\nbased electoral districts in which the majority of voters are Black.\nDescriptive racial representation holds that Black populations are best\nrepresented by Black politicians. Iris Marion Young (1990,\n183–191) provides a spirited defense of descriptive\nrepresentation for racial minorities, grounded in their experiences of\n“oppression, the institutional constraint on\nself-determination”, and domination “the institutional\nconstraint on self-determination” (1990, 37). Anne Phillips\n(1995) furthers this position, arguing that representatives who are\nmembers of minority racial groups can enhance legislative\ndeliberation. Melissa Williams (1998) also defends the deliberative\ncontribution of descriptive racial representation, but adds that\nminority constituents are more likely to trust minority\nrepresentatives, since both will be affected by laws that overtly or\ncovertly discriminate against minority racial groups. Finally, Jane\nMansbridge (1999) carefully demonstrates why a critical mass of\nminority representatives is needed, in order to adequately advocate\nfor common minority interests as well as to convey the internal\ndiversity within the group. In a later work, Young (2000) addresses\ncritics who argue that descriptive representation relies upon group\nessentialism, since members of a racial group need not all share the\nsame interests or opinions. In response, Young suggests that members\nof the same racial group do share the same “social\nperspective” grounded in common experiences, similar to the\ninteractive kind variant of racial constructivism\ndiscussed earlier. But because it is unclear that Black individuals\nare more likely to share common experiences than common interests or\nopinions, Michael James prioritizes using race-conscious districting\nto create Black racial constituencies which can hold Black or\nnon-Black representatives accountable to Black interests (James 2011).\nAbigail Thernstrom (1987) condemns race-conscious districting for\nviolating the original principles behind the 1965 Voting Rights Act\nand the 15th Amendment, by promoting the election of black\nrepresentatives rather than simply guaranteeing black voters the right\nto cast ballots.

Morgan Kousser (1999) responds that race-conscious\ndistricting simply reflects the right to cast a\n“meaningful” vote, as implied by the 15th\nAmendment protection against not only the denial but also the\n“abridgment” of the right to vote. Lani Guinier (1994)\ncompellingly suggests that instead of drawing majority black\ndistricts, we should adopt more proportional electoral system that\nfacilitate the electoral strength of racial and other minorities.\nMichael James (2004) suggests that alternative electoral systems\nfacilitate not only descriptive racial representation but also\ndemocratic deliberation across racial lines. \nA general advantage of using alternative electoral systems to enhance\nminority racial representation is that they are technically\ncolorblind, not requiring lawmakers or judges to group citizens\naccording to their racial identities. The general value of\ncolorblindness is an ongoing topic of debate within legal philosophy.\nDrawing on Justice John Marshall Harlan’s famous dissent in Plessy\nv. Ferguson, and a not-uncontroversial interpretation of the\norigins of the equal protection clause, Andrew Kull (1992) argues that\ncontemporary American statutory and constitutional law should strive\nto be colorblind and combat racial inequality without dividing\ncitizens into different racial groups. Ian Haney Lopez (2006,\n143–162), on the other hand, fears “colorblind white\ndominance,” whereby facially race-neutral laws leave untouched\nthe race-based inequality that operates within American political,\nlegal, and economic structures. Elizabeth Anderson (2010) provides a\ntrenchant critique of colorblindness as a normative standard for law,\npolicy, or ethics. Racial segregation and the potential for\nintegration have garnered much less philosophical attention than\naffirmative action and racially descriptive representation. Bernard\nBoxill (1992) offers a treatment of busing and self-segregation, while\nHoward McGary (1999) offers a clarification of integration and\nseparation. Iris Young (2002, chapter 6) treats residential\nsegregation in the context of regional democracy, while Owen Fiss\n(2003) analyzes it in the context of the legacy of racism. Anderson\nherself (2010) argues for the moral imperative of integration, with\nTommie Shelby (2014) and Ronald Sundstrom (2013) offering critical\nresponses to Anderson’s argument. More recently, Andrew Valls (2018,\nchapter 6) has written on the subject. \nIn recent years, the problem of racism within policing and criminal\njustice in the United States has attracted intense popular and\nscholarly attention. Mathias Risse and Richard Zeckhauser (2004) offer\na qualified defense of racial profiling that engages both utilitarian\nand non-consequentialist reasoning. Annabelle Lever’s (2005)\nobjection and response prompted a subsequent round of debate (Risse\n2007, Lever 2007). Michelle Alexander (2010) famously depicted the\ncontemporary American criminal justice system as the “New Jim\nCrow,” for its intense racial disparities. Naomi Zack (2015)\nprovides a trenchant critique of racial profiling and police homicide.\nDavid Boonin (2011), on the other hand, reluctantly defends racial\nprofiling on pragmatic grounds. Finally, Adam Hosein (2018) argues\nagainst it for reasons of political equality. Shelby (2016) offers a\njustification of Black resistance based in the unjust legacy of racial\nsegregation while deepening his earlier critique of Anderson’s\nview. \nWhile the debates in contemporary philosophy of race within the\nanalytic tradition have largely revolved around whether or not races\nexist along with criteria for determining realness or existence,\nphilosophers working in the Continental traditions have taken up the\nconcept of race along other dimensions (see Bernasconi and Cook 2003\nfor an overview). First, those working within the traditions of\nExistentialism and Phenomenology have called on Fanon, Merleau-Ponty,\nand Sartre, among others, to understand how race and functions within\nour lived, bodily experiences of everyday life. This strand of\nscholarship focuses on the materiality of race. As Emily S. Lee puts\nit, “both the social structural and the individual subconscious\nlevels of analysis rely on perceiving the embodiment of race”\n(2014, 1). Second, philosophers building on the work of Michel\nFoucault have articulated genealogical understandings of race that\nfocus on its historical emergence as a concept and the ways that it\nhas functioned within discourses of knowledge and power. \nFrantz Fanon has been the primary influence for those understanding\nrace and racism within Existentialism and Phenomenology. In Black\nSkin, White Masks Fanon writes, “I came into this world\nanxious to uncover the meaning of things, my soul desirous to be at\nthe origin of the world, and here I am an object among other\nobjects” (2008/1952, 89). Furthermore, this “inferiority\nis determined by the Other,” by the “white gaze”\n(2008/1952, 90). Such a position is understood through the schema of\nthe body: “In a white world, the man of color encounters\ndifficulties in elaborating his body schema. The image of one’s body\nis solely negating. It’s an image in the third person”\n(2008/1952, 90). Rather than being at home in his own body, and moving\n“out of habit,” Fanon understands his body as existing\nprimarily as an object for others, requiring him to move “by\nimplicit knowledge” of the rules and norms of that white world\n(2008/1952, 91). \nFanon critiques Sartre’s understanding of race and racism by\npointing out that Sartre understands antiracism as a negative movement\nthat will be overcome (2008/1952, 111–112). Sartre treats\nantiracism as the transition toward something else and not as an end\nin itself. Against this view Fanon writes, “ Sartre forgets that\nthe Black man suffers in his body quite differently from the white\nman” (2008/1952, 117). He is trapped by his body schema,\n“a toy in the hands of the white man” (2008/1952,\n119). \nLewis Gordon draws on both Fanon and Sartre in articulating his\nAfricana existentialism. He distinguishes between Existentialism as a\nspecific historical European movement and philosophies of existence,\nor existential philosophies, which are preoccupied with\n“freedom, anguish, responsibility, embodied agency, sociality,\nand liberation.” These concerns yield a focus on the\n“lived context of concern” (2000, 10). For Gordon, due to\nthe history of racial oppression of Black peoples, an Africana\nexistential philosophy revolves around the questions, “what does\nit mean to be a problem, and what is to be understood by Black\nsuffering?” (2000, 8). \nAccording to Gordon, what is sometimes referred to as the “race\nquestion” is really a question about the status of Blackness,\nfor “race has emerged, throughout its history, as the question\nfundamentally of ‘the blacks’ as it has for no other\ngroup” (2000, 12). Rather than a denial that other groups have\nbeen racialized, the claim instead is that such other racializations\nhave been conditioned on a scale of European personhood to Black\nsubpersonhood (see also Mills 1998, 6–10). Blackness itself has been\ncharacterized as “the breakdown of reason” and “an\nexistential enigma” in such a way that to ask after race and\nracialization is to ask after Blackness in the first instance. \nBoth Gordon and Zack use Sartre’s notion of bad faith to\nunderstand race. We can understand bad faith as the evasion of\nresponsibility and fidelity to human freedom, and an understanding of\nthe human being as a for-itself. Bad faith falsely turns the human\nbeing into an object without agency, into an in-itself. For Gordon,\nantiblack racism conceives of Blackness itself as a problem so as to\navoid having to understand Black problems. As a result, actual Black\npeople disappear along with any responsibility to them (1997, 74).\nGordon gives the example of The Philadelphia Negro, Du\nBois’ sociological study of the residents of Philadelphia’s\nSeventh Ward. Gordon recounts how those commissioning the study set Du\nBois up to fail so that he would only perpetuate the pathologizing of\nthe Black population, presenting Blackness itself as a problem rather\nthan attempt to understand the problems of Black people and\ncommunities (2000, 69). \nWhereas Gordon uses bad faith to understand antiblack racism, Zack\ndoes so to deepen her eliminativism. For Sartre, authenticity is the\nantidote to bad faith – to live authentically is to understand\nand embrace human freedom rather than evade it. Zack’s\neliminativism attributes bad faith to those who affirm that racial\ndesignations describe human beings when in fact they do not (1993,\n3–4). If racial identifications lack adequate support because\nraces do not exist, then identification as mixed race is also done in\nbad faith. Instead, Zack understands her position of\n“anti-race” as true authenticity that looks to the future\nin the name of freedom and resistance to oppression in the name of\nracelessness (1993, 164). \nEmbodiment and visibility are central to these views. Gordon\nunderstands the body as “our perspective in the world,”\nwhich occurs along (at least) three matrices: seeing, being seen, and\nbeing conscious of being seen (1997, 71). In an antiblack world this\nmeans that the Black body is a form of absence, going unseen in the\nsame manner as Ralph Ellison’s protagonist in Invisible Man\n(1997, 72–3). George Yancy tells us that he writes from his\n“lived embodied experience,” which is a “site of\nexposure” (2008, 65). Black embodiment here is the lens used to\ncritique whiteness and its normative gaze. For Yancy, Black resistance\nitself decodes and recodes Black embodied existence, affirming the\nvalue of the Black body in the face of centuries of white denial\n(2008, 112–3). \nLinda Martín Alcoff offers a phenomenological account of race that\nhighlights a “visual registry,” which is socially and\nhistorically constructed and that is “determinant over\nindividual experience” (2006, 194). Like Yancy, Alcoff locates\nrace in embodied lived experience. Drawing on Maurice\nMerleau-Ponty’s work, Alcoff notes how the way that our perceptual\npractices are organized affects the way we come to know the world\n(2006, 188). When race operates through visibility, these ways of\nnormalized perceptual knowing become racialized. As she notes,\n“racial consciousness works through learned practices and habits\nof visual discrimination and visual marks on the body…race\nexists there on the body itself” (2006, 196). \nLee argues that racial meaning fits squarely within the space that a\nphenomenological framework seeks to explore, namely, the space between\nthe natural and the cultural, the objective and the subjective, and\nthinking and nonthinking (Lee 2014, 8). Furthermore, a\nphenomenological approach can illuminate how, even when race is\nunderstood as a social construction, it can nonetheless become\nnaturalized through “the sedimentation of racial meaning into\nthe very structures and practices of society” (Lee 2019,\nxi). \nA second line of thought runs through the work of Michel Foucault. In\nhis 1975–1976 lectures at the Collège de France, published\nas Society Must Be Defended, Foucault details the emergence\nof a discourse on race beginning in early 17th Century England.\nAccording to Foucault, race war discourse emerges through claims of\nillegitimacy against the Stuart monarchy. These claims were couched in\nthe language of injustice as well as foreign invasion, in which an\nindigenous race is pitted against in invading outsider (2003, 60).\nRace, at this point, is not a biological concept, instead referring to\nlineage, custom, and tradition (2003, 77). Only later does this\ncultural notion of race transform into the scientific notion of\nrace. \nCornel West employs a Foucaultian methodology to produce a genealogy\nof modern racism (1982). West analyzes how the discourse of modernity\ncame into being to show how central white supremacy is to its\npractices of knowledge and meaning making (47). By modern discourse he\nmeans, “The controlling metaphors, notions, categories, and\nnorms that shape the predominant conception of truth and knowledge in\nthe modern West,” which are driven by the scientific revolution,\nthe Cartesian transformation of philosophy, and the classical revival\n(50). It is a discourse comprising certain forms of rationality,\nscientificity, objectivity, and aesthetic and cultural ideals, the\nparameters of which exclude Black equality from the outset, marking it\nas unintelligible and illegitimate within the prevailing norms of\ndiscourse and knowledge (47–48). Notions of truth and knowledge\nproduced by these three forces are governed by a value-free subject\nthat observes, compares, orders, and measures in order to obtain\nevidence and make inferences that verify the true representations of\nreality. \nLadelle McWhorter uses Foucault’s lectures to conduct a\ngenealogy of racism and sexual oppression of a more proximate time and\nplace. According to McWhorter, “racism in twentieth-century\nAnglo-America [has] to be understood in light of Foucault’s work on\nnormalization,” where racism exists as a crusade against\ndeviance, abnormality, and pathology (2009, 12). Building on\nFoucault’s analysis of race war discourse McWhorter carries out a\ngenealogy of race, ultimately arguing that race and sexuality\n“are historically codependent and mutually determinative”\n(2009, 14). Anglo-American discourse on race is therefore linked to\ndiscourses on eugenics, the family, sexual predation, normality, and\npopulation management, all of which function within the networks of\npower that Foucault referred to biopower (2009, 15). Ann Laura Stoler\n(1995) offers an extended reconstruction and critique of\nFoucault’s treatment of race in light of colonialism and\nempire. Joy James goes even further, arguing that Foucault is not useful for thinking about race at all (1996, chapter 1).","contact.mail":"adam.burgos@bucknell.edu","contact.domain":"bucknell.edu"}]
