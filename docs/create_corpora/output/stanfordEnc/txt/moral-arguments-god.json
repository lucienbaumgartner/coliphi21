Moral arguments are both important and\ninteresting. They are interesting because evaluating their\nsoundness requires attention to practically every important\nphilosophical issue dealt with in metaethics. They are important\nbecause of their prominence in popular apologetic arguments for\nreligious belief. Evidence for this can be found in the amazing\npopularity of C. S. Lewis’s Mere Christianity\n(1952), which is almost certainly the best-selling book of\napologetics in the twentieth century, and which begins with a moral\nargument for God’s existence. Many ordinary people regard\nreligion as in some way providing a basis or foundation for\nmorality. This fact might seem to favor religious arguments for\nmorality rather than moral arguments for religious belief, but if\nsomeone believes that morality is in some way “objective”\nor “real,” and that this moral reality requires\nexplanation, moral arguments for God’s reality naturally suggest\nthemselves. The apparent connection between morality and religion\nappears to many people to support the claim that moral truths require a\nreligious foundation, or can best be explained by God’s\nexistence, or some qualities or actions of God.\n\n\n\nAfter some general comments about theistic arguments and a brief\nhistory of moral arguments, this essay will discuss several different\nforms of the moral argument. A major distinction is that between\nmoral arguments that are theoretical in nature and practical or\npragmatic arguments. The former are best thought of as arguments\nthat begin with alleged moral facts and argue that God is necessary to\nexplain those facts, or at least that God provides a better explanation\nof them than secular accounts can offer. The latter typically\nbegin with claims about some good or end that morality requires and\nargue that this end is not attainable unless God exists. Whether\nthis distinction is hard and fast will be one of the questions to be\ndiscussed, as some argue that practical arguments by themselves cannot\nbe the basis of rational belief. To meet such concerns practical\narguments may have to include a theoretical dimension as well.\n\n\n\nBefore attempting to explain and assess moral arguments for the\nexistence of God, it would be helpful to have some perspective on the\ngoals of arguments for God’s existence. (I shall\ngenerically term arguments for God’s existence “theistic\narguments.”) Of course views about this are diverse, but most\ncontemporary proponents of such arguments do not see theistic arguments\nas attempted “proofs,” in the sense that they are supposed\nto provide valid arguments with premises that no reasonable person\ncould deny. Such a standard of achievement would clearly be\nsetting the bar for success very high, and proponents of theistic\narguments rightly note that philosophical arguments for interesting\nconclusions in any field outside of formal logic hardly ever reach such\na standard. More reasonable questions to ask about theistic\narguments would seem to be the following: Are there valid\narguments for the conclusion that God exists that have premises that\nare known or reasonably believed by some people? Are the premises\nof such arguments more reasonable than their denials, at least for some\nreasonable people? Arguments that met these standards could have\nvalue in making belief in God reasonable for some people, or even\ngiving some people knowledge of God’s existence, even if it turns\nout that some of the premises of the arguments can be reasonably denied\nby other people, and thus that the arguments fail as proofs. \n\nIt is of course possible that an argument for God’s existence\ncould provide some evidence for God’s existence, in the sense\nthat the argument increases the probability or plausibility of the\nclaim that God exists, even if the argument does not provide enough\nsupport by itself for full-fledged belief that God exists. A\nproponent of the moral argument who viewed the argument in this way\nmight in that case regard the argument as part of a cumulative case for\ntheism, and hold that the moral argument must be supplemented by other\npossible arguments, such as the “fine-tuning” argument from\nthe physical constants of the universe, or an argument from religious\nexperience. A non-believer might even concede some version of a\ntheistic argument has some evidential force, but claim that the overall\nbalance of evidence does not support belief. \n\nA major issue that cannot be settled here concerns the question of\nwhere the burden of proof lies with respect to theistic\narguments. Many secular philosophers follow Antony Flew (1976) in\nholding that there is a “presumption of atheism.” \nBelieving in God is like believing in the Loch Ness Monster or\nleprechauns, something that reasonable people do not do without\nsufficient evidence. If such evidence is lacking, the proper\nstance is atheism rather than agnosticism. \n\nThis “presumption of atheism” has been challenged in a\nnumber of ways. Alvin Plantinga (2000) has argued that reasonable\nbelief in God does not have to be based on propositional evidence, but\ncan be “properly basic.” On this view,\nreasonable belief in God can be the outcome of a basic faculty (called\nthe sensus divinitatis by theologian John Calvin) and thus\nneeds no support from arguments at all. In response some would\nargue that even if theistic belief is not grounded in propositional\nevidence, it still might require non-propositional evidence (such as\nexperience), so it is not clear that Plantinga’s view by itself\nremoves the burden of proof challenge. \n\nA second way to challenge the presumption of atheism is to question\nan implicit assumption made by those who defend such a presumption,\nwhich is that belief in God is epistemologically more risky than\nunbelief. The assumption might be defended in the following\nway: One might think that theists and atheists share a belief in\nmany entities: atoms, middle-sized physical objects, animals, and\nstars, for example. Someone, however, who believes in leprechauns\nor sea monsters in addition to these commonly accepted objects thereby\nincurs a burden of proof. Such a person believes in “one\nadditional thing” and thus seems to incur additional\nepistemological risk. One might think that belief in God is\nrelevantly like belief in a leprechaun or sea monster, and thus that\nthe theist also bears an additional burden of proof. Without good\nevidence in favor of belief in God the safe option is to refrain from\nbelief. \n\nHowever, the theist may hold that this account does not accurately\nrepresent the situation. Instead, the theist may argue that the\ndebate between atheism and theism is not simply an argument about\nwhether “one more thing” exists in the world. In\nfact, God is not to be understood as an entity in the world at all; any\nsuch entity would by definition not be God. The debate is rather\na debate about the character of the universe. The theist believes\nthat every object in the natural world exists because God creates and\nconserves that object; every finite thing has the character of being\ndependent on God. The atheist denies this and affirms that the\nbasic entities in the natural world have the character of existing\n“on their own.” If this is the right way to think\nabout the debate, then it is not obvious that atheism is safer than\ntheism. The debate is not about the existence of one object, but\nthe character of the universe as a whole. Both parties are making\nclaims about the character of everything in the natural world, and both\nclaims seem risky. This point is especially important in dealing\nwith moral arguments for theism, since one of the questions raised by\nsuch arguments is the adequacy of a naturalistic worldview in\nexplaining morality. Evidentialists may properly ask about the\nevidence for theism, but it also seems proper to ask about the evidence\nfor atheism if the atheist is committed to a rival metaphysic such as\nnaturalism. \n\nSomething that resembles a moral argument for God’s existence,\nor at least an argument from value, can be found in the fourth of\nThomas Aquinas’s “Five Ways” (Aquinas 1265–1274, I,\n1, 3). Aquinas there begins with the claim that among beings who\npossess such qualities as “good, true, and noble” there are\ngradations. Presumably he means that some things that are good\nare better than other good things; perhaps some noble people are nobler\nthan others who are noble. In effect Aquinas is claiming that\nwhen we “grade” things in this way we are, at least\nimplicitly, comparing them to some absolute standard. Aquinas\nbelieves this standard cannot be merely “ideal” or\n“hypothetical,” and thus this gradation is only possible if\nthere is some being which has this quality to a “maximum”\nextent: “so that there is something which is truest, something\nbest, something noblest and, consequently, something which is uttermost\nbeing; for those things that are greatest in truth are greatest in\nbeing, as it is written in Metaph. Ii.” Aquinas goes on to affirm\nthat this being which provides the standard is also the cause or\nexplanation of the existence of these qualities, and such a cause must\nbe God. Obviously, this argument draws deeply on Platonic and\nAristotelian assumptions that are no longer widely held by\nphilosophers. For the argument to be plausible today, such assumptions\nwould have to be defended, or else the argument reformulated in a way\nthat frees it from its original metaphysical home. \n\nProbably the most influential versions of the moral argument for\nbelief in God can be traced to Kant (1788 [1956]), who famously argued\nthat the theoretical arguments for God’s existence were\nunsuccessful, but presented a rational argument for belief in God as a\n“postulate of practical reason.” Kant held that a rational,\nmoral being must necessarily will “the highest good,” which\nconsists of a world in which people are both morally good and happy,\nand in which moral virtue is the condition for happiness. The\nlatter condition implies that this end must be sought solely by moral\naction. However, Kant held that a person cannot rationally will\nsuch an end without believing that moral actions can successfully\nachieve such an end, and this requires a belief that the causal\nstructure of nature is conducive to the achievement of this end by\nmoral means. This is equivalent to belief in God, a moral being who is\nultimately responsible for the character of the natural world. \nKant’s arguments will be discussed later in this article. \n\nKant-inspired arguments were prominent in the nineteenth century,\nand continued to be important right up to the middle of the twentieth\ncentury. Such arguments can be found, for example, in W. R.\nSorley (1918), Hastings Rashdall (1920), and A. E. Taylor\n(1945/1930). Although Henry Sidgwick was not himself a proponent\nof a moral argument for God’s existence, some have argued that\nhis thought presents the materials for such an argument (see Walls and\nBaggett 2011). In the nineteenth century John Henry Newman (1870)\nalso made good use of a moral argument in his case for belief in God,\ndeveloping what could be called an argument from conscience. \n\nIn recent philosophy there has been a revival of divine command\nmetaethical theories, which has in turn led to new versions of the\nmoral argument found in such thinkers as Robert Adams (1987), John\nHare (1996), and C. Stephen Evans (2010). However, it is important to\nsee that there are versions of the moral argument for God’s\nexistence that are completely independent of such a divine command\ntheory, and this possibility can be seen in arguments developed by\nAngus Ritchie (2012) and Mark Linville (2009). Perhaps the most\nextensive and developed account of a moral argument for God’s\nexistence in recent philosophy is found in David Baggett and Jerry\nL. Walls (2016).  This book examines a comprehensive form of moral\nargument and extensively explores underlying issues. It goes without\nsaying that these renewed arguments have engendered new criticisms as\nwell. \n\nTheoretical moral arguments for God’s existence can be\nunderstood as variations on the following template: \n\nAs we shall see, there are a variety of features of morality that\ncan be appealed to in the first steps of the arguments, as well as a\nvariety of ways in which God might be thought to provide an explanation\nof those features in the second steps. The use of the somewhat\nvague phrase “objective moral facts” is intended to allow\nfor this variety. Both types of premises are obviously open to\nchallenge. For example, the first premise of such an argument can\nbe challenged by popular metaethical views that see morality as\n“subjective,” or “expressive,” rather than\nsomething that consists of objective facts, and also by moral\nsceptics. The second premise can be challenged on the basis of\nrival explanations of the features of morality, explanations that do\nnot require God. Arguments about the second premise then may\nrequire comparison between theistic explanations of morality and these\nrival views. \n\nIt is easy to see then that the proponent of a moral argument has a\ncomplex task: She must defend the reality and objectivity of the\nfeature of morality appealed to, but also defend the claim that this\nfeature can be best explained by God. The second part of the task\nmay require not only demonstrating the strengths of a theistic\nexplanation, but pointing out weaknesses in rival secular explanations\nas well. Both parts of the task are essential, but it is worth\nnoting that the two components cannot be accomplished simultaneously.\n The theist must defend the reality of morality against\nsubjectivist and nihilistic critics. Assuming that this task has\nbeen carried out, the theist must then try to show that morality thus\nunderstood requires a theistic explanation. \n\nIt is interesting to observe, however, that with respect to both\nparts of the task, the theist may enlist non-theists as allies. \nThe theist may well make common cause with ethical naturalists as well\nas ethical non-naturalists in defending moral realism against\n“projective” theories such as expressivism. However,\nthe theist may also enlist the support of “error theorists”\nsuch as J. L. Mackie (1977), and “moral nihilists” such as\nFriedrich Nietzsche (1887) in arguing that God is necessary for\nobjective morality. Nietzsche, for example, explicitly holds that\nGod does not exist, but also claims that God’s non-existence\nundermines the reality of traditional western morality. The fact that\ntheists can enlist such unlikely allies does not mean the moral\nargument for God’s existence is sound, but it does suggest that\nthe argument is not obviously question-begging, since both premises are\nsometimes accepted by (different) non-believers. \n\nOne easily understandable version of a theistic moral argument\nrelies on an analogy between human laws promulgated by nation-states\nand moral laws. Sovereign states enact laws that make certain\nacts forbidden or required. If I am a U. S. citizen, and I earn\nmore than a small amount of money I am obligated to file an income tax\nreturn each year. I am also forbidden, because of the laws that\nhold in the United States, to discriminate in hiring on the basis of\nage or race. Many people believe that there are moral laws that\nbind individuals in the same way that political laws do. I am\nobligated by a moral principle not to lie to others, and I am similarly\nobligated to keep promises that I have made. (Both legal and\nmoral laws may be understood as holding prima facie, so that\nin some situations a person must violate one law in order to obey a\nmore important one.) \n\nWe know how human laws come into existence. They are enacted\nby legislatures (or absolute monarchs in some countries) who have the\nauthority to pass such laws. How then should the existence of\nmoral laws be explained? It seems plausible to many to hold that\nthey must be similarly grounded in some appropriate moral authority,\nand the only plausible candidate to fulfill this role is God. \nSome philosophers have dismissed an argument of this type as\n“crude,” presumably because its force is so obvious that no\nspecial philosophical training is necessary to understand it and see\nits appeal. The fact that one can understand the argument without\nmuch in the way of philosophical skill is not necessarily a defect,\nhowever. If one supposes that there is a God, and that God wants\nhumans to know him and relate to him, one would expect God to make his\nreality known to humans in very obvious ways (See Evans 2010). \nAfter all, critics of theistic belief, such as J. L. Schellenberg\n(1993), have argued that the fact that God’s reality is not\nobvious to those who would like to believe in God is a grave problem.\nIf an awareness of moral obligations is in fact an awareness of\nGod’s commands or divine laws, then the ordinary person who is\naware of moral obligations does have a kind of awareness of God. \nOf course such a person might be aware of God’s laws without\nrealizing that they are God’s laws; she might be aware of\nGod’s commands without being aware of them under that\ndescription. The religious apologist might view such a person as\nalready having a kind of de re awareness of God, because a\nmoral obligation is simply an expression of God’s will. \n\nHow can such an awareness be converted into full-fledged belief in\nGod? One way of doing this would be to help the person gain the\nskills needed to recognize moral laws as what they are, as\ndivine commands or divine laws. If moral laws are experienced,\nthen moral experience could be viewed as a kind of religious experience\nor at least a proto-religious experience. Perhaps someone who has\nexperience of God in this way does not need a moral argument (or any\nkind of argument) to have a reasonable belief in God. This may be\none instance of the kind of case that Alvin Plantinga (2000) and the\n“Reformed epistemologists” have in mind when they claim\nthat belief in God can be “properly basic.” It is\nworth noting then that there could be such a thing as knowledge of God\nthat is rooted in moral experience without that knowledge being the\nresult of a moral argument. \n\nEven if that is the case, however, a moral argument could still play\na valuable role. Such an argument might be one way of helping an\nindividual understand that moral obligations are in fact divine\ncommands or laws. Even if it were true that some ordinary people\nmight know that God exists without argument, an argument could be\nhelpful in defending the claim that this is the case. A\nperson might conceivably need an argument for the second level claim\nthat the person knows God without argument. \n\nIn any case a divine command metaethical theory provides the\nmaterial for such an argument. The revival of divine command\ntheories (DCT) of moral obligation is due mainly to the work of Philip\nQuinn (1979/1978) and Robert Adams (1999). Adams’ version\nof a DCT has been particularly influential and is well-suited for the\ndefense of the claim that moral knowledge can provide knowledge of\nGod. Adams’ version of a DCT is an account of moral\nobligations and it must be distinguished from more general\n“voluntarist” views of ethics that try to treat other moral\nproperties (such as the good) as dependent on God’s will. \nAs explained below, by limiting the theory to obligations, Adams avoids\nthe standard “Euthyphro” objection, which claims\nthat divine command views reduce ethics to arbitrariness. \n\nAdams’ account of moral obligations as divine commands rests on a more\ngeneral social theory of obligations. There are of course many types\nof obligations: legal obligations, financial obligations, obligations\nof etiquette, and obligations that hold in virtue of belonging to some\nclub or association, to name just a few. Clearly these obligations are\ndistinct from moral obligations, since in some cases moral obligations\ncan conflict with these other kinds. What is distinctive about\nobligations in general? They are not reducible simply to normative\nclaims about what a person has a good reason to do. J. S. Mill (1874,\n164–165) argued that we can explain normative principles without\nmaking any reference to God. He contends that the “feeling of\nobligation” stems from “something that the internal\nconscience bears witness to in its own nature,” and thus the\nmoral law, unlike human laws, “does not originate in the will of\na legislator or legislature external to the mind.” Doubtless\nMill had in mind here such normative logical principles as “it\nis wrong to believe both p and not-p at\nthe same time.” Mill argues that such normative principles hold\nwithout any requirement for an “authority” to be their\nground. Mill’s view is plausible, though some theists have argued that\nmetaphysical naturalists have difficulty in explaining any kind of\nnormativity (see Devine 1989, 88–89). However, even if Mill is\ncorrect about normativity in general, it does not follow that his view\nis correct for obligations, which have a special character. An\nobligation has a special kind of force; we should care about complying\nwith it, and violations of obligations appropriately incur blame\n(Adams 1999, 235). If I make a logical mistake, I may feel silly or\nstupid or embarrassed, but I have no reason to feel guilty, unless the\nmistake reflects some carelessness on my part that itself constitutes\na violation of a moral obligation. Adams argues that “facts of\nobligation are constituted by broadly social requirements.”\n(ibid, 233) For example, the social role of parenting is partly\nconstituted by the obligations one assumes by becoming a parent, and\nthe social role of citizen is partly constituted by the obligations to\nobey the laws of the country in which one is a citizen. \n\nAll obligations are then constituted by social requirements, according\nto Adams. However, not all obligations constituted by social\nrequirements are moral obligations. What social relation could be the\nbasis of moral obligations? Adams argues that not just any human\nsocial relation will possess the requisite authority:\n“A morally valid obligation obviously will not be\nconstituted by just any demand sponsored by a system of social\nrelationships that one in fact values. Some such demands have no moral\nforce, and some social systems are downright evil.” (ibid, 242)\nIf a good and loving God exists and has created all humans, then the\nsocial relation humans have to God has the right features to explain\nmoral obligations. For if moral obligations stem from God’s\nrequirements, they will be objective, but they will also be\nmotivating, since a relation to God would clearly be a great good that\nhumans would have reason to value. Since a proper relation to God is\narguably more important than any other social relation, we can also\nunderstand why moral obligations trump other kinds of obligations. On\nthis view we can also explain why moral obligations have a\ntranscendent character, which is important because “a genuinely\nmoral conception of obligation must have resources for moral criticism\nof social systems and their demands.” (ibid, 242–243) \n\nNotice that the DCT Adams defends is ontological rather than\nsemantic: it is a claim that moral obligations are in fact\nidentical with divine commands, not a claim that “moral\nobligations” has the same meaning as “divine\ncommands.” On his account, the meaning of “moral\nobligation” is fixed by the role this concept plays in our\nlanguage. That role includes such facts as these: Moral\nobligations must be motivating and objective. They also must\nprovide a basis for critical evaluation of other types of obligations,\nand they must be such that someone who violates a moral obligation is\nappropriately subject to blame. Adams argues that it is divine\ncommands that best satisfy these desiderata. God’s\nexistence thus provides the best explanation of moral\nobligations. If moral obligations are identical with divine\ncommands (or perhaps if they are grounded in or caused to exist by\ndivine commands) an argument for God’s existence from such\nobligations can easily be constructed: \n\nThis argument is stated in a deductive form, but it can easily be\nreworded as a probabilistic “argument to the best\nexplanation,” as follows: \n\nObviously, those who do not find a DCT convincing will not think\nthis argument from moral obligation has force. However, Adams\nanticipates and gives a forceful answer to one common criticism of a\nDCT. It is often argued that a DCT must fail because of a dilemma\nparallel to one derived from Plato’s Euthyphro. \nThe dilemma for a DCT can be derived from the following question: \nAssuming that God commands what is right, does he command what is right\nbecause it is right? If the proponent of a DCT answers\naffirmatively, then it appears the quality of rightness must hold\nantecedently to and thus independently of God’s commands. \nIf, however, the proponent denies that God commands what is right\nbecause it is right, then God’s commands appear arbitrary. \nAdams’ version of a DCT evades this dilemma by holding that God\nis essentially good and that his commands are necessarily aimed at the\ngood. This allows Adams to claim that God’s commands make\nactions obligatory (or forbidden), while denying that the commands are\narbitrary. \n\nAlthough Adams’ version of a DCT successfully meets this\n“Euthyphro” objection, there are other powerful\ncriticisms that have been mounted against this metaethical theory in\nthe literature. These objections can be found in the writings of Wes\nMorriston (2009), Erik Wielenberg (2005, 2014, especially chapter 2),\nand Nicholas Wolterstorff (2007), among others.  Wielenberg explicitly\ndefends as an alternative to divine command metaethics a view he calls\n“godless normative realism”. This is essentially the view\nthat moral truths are basic or fundamental in character, not derived\nfrom natural facts or any more fundamental metaphysical facts.  It\nthus seems similar to the view often called “ethical\nnon-naturalism”.  This view certainly provides a significant\nalternative to divine command metaethics.  However, it is worth noting\nthat some of the criticisms that metaphysical naturalists have against\ntheistic metaethics may apply to Wielenberg’s view as well.\nSpecifically, philosophers such as J. L. Mackie (1977) find\nnon-natural ethical qualities of any kind “queer” since\nthey are so unlike the realities discovered by science.  The\n“brute moral facts” posited by Wielenberg as necessary\ntruths seem vulnerable to this same criticism.  In fact, the criticism\nmay be sharper against Wielenberg’s view than against theistic views,\nsince ethical truths may appear less odd in a universe that is\nultimately grounded in a person.  Responses to the objections of\nWielenberg, Morriston, and others have also been given (see Evans\n2013, Baggett and Walls, 2011, 2016). Clearly the version of a moral\nargument for God’s existence that rests on divine command theory will\nonly be judged powerful by those who find a DCT plausible, and that\nwill certainly be a minority of philosophers.  (Although it is worth\nnoting that no single metaethical theory seems to enjoy widespread\nsupport among philosophers, so a DCT is not alone in being a minority\nview.) Nevertheless, those who do find a DCT powerful will also see\nmoral obligations as providing strong evidence for God’s reality. \n\nA variety of arguments have been developed that God is necessary to\nexplain human awareness of moral truth (or moral knowledge, if one\nbelieves that this moral awareness amounts to knowledge). Richard\nSwinburne (2004, 218), for example, argues that there is no\n“great probability that moral awareness will occur in a Godless\nuniverse.” On Swinburne’s view, moral truths are either\nnecessary truths or contingent truths that are grounded in necessary\ntruths. For example, it is obviously contingent that “It is\nwrong to drop an atomic bomb on Hiroshima,” since it is\ncontingent that there exists a city such as Hiroshima. But one\nmight hold that this proposition is true (assuming it is) because of\nsome other truth such as “It is wrong intentionally to kill\ninnocent humans” which does hold universally and is necessarily\ntrue. Swinburne does not think that an argument from moral facts\nas such is powerful. However, the fact that we humans are aware\nof moral facts is itself surprising and calls for an explanation. \n\nIt may be true that creatures who belong to groups that behave\naltruistically will have some survival advantage over groups that lack\nsuch a trait. However, moral beliefs are not required in order to\nproduce such behavior, since it is clear that “there are many\nspecies of animals that are naturally inclined to help others of their\nspecies, and yet do not have moral beliefs.” (Swinburne 2004,\n217) If God exists, he has “significant reason to bring about\nconscious beings with moral awareness,” since his intended\npurpose for humans includes making it possible for them freely to\nchoose good over evil, since this will make it possible for them to\ndevelop a relation to God. Swinburne does not think that this\nargument provides very strong evidence for God’s existence by\nitself, but rather that it provides some inductive support for belief\nin God. It is one of several phenomena which seem more probable\nin a theistic universe than in a godless universe. As we consider\nmore and more such phenomena, it will be increasingly improbable that\n“they will all occur.” (ibid, 218) All of\nthese inductive arguments together may then provide substantial support\nfor theistic belief, even if no one of them by itself would be\nsufficient for rational belief. \n\nSwinburne’s version of the argument is quite brief and\nundeveloped, but some claims that could be used to support a more\ndeveloped version of the argument (one that will be described below)\ncan be found in a well-known and much cited article by Sharon Street\n(2006). Street’s argument, as the title implies, is in no way\nintended to support a moral argument for theism. To the contrary, her\npurpose is to defend anti-realist metaethical theories against realist\ntheories that view moral truth as “stance-independent” of\nhuman attitudes and emotions.  Street presents the moral realist with\na dilemma posed by the question as to how our human evaluative beliefs\nare related to human evolution. It is clear, she believes, that\nevolution has strongly shaped our evaluative attitudes. The question\nconcerns how those attitudes are related to the objective evaluative\ntruths accepted by the realist. If the realist holds that there is no\nrelation between such truths and our evaluative attitudes, then this\nimplies that “most of our evaluative judgments are off track due\nto the distorting influence of Darwinian processes.” The other\nalternative for the realist is to claim that there is a relationship,\nand thus that is not an accident or miracle that our evaluative\nbeliefs track the objective truths. However, this view, Street claims,\nis scientifically implausible. Street argues therefore that an\nevolutionary story about how we came to make the moral judgments we\nmake undermines confidence in the objective truth of those\njudgments. Street’s argument is of course controversial and\nthinkers such as Erik Wielenberg (2014) have argued against\nevolutionary debunking arguments. Still, many regard such arguments as\nproblematic for those who want to defend moral realism, particularly\nwhen developed as a “global” argument (Kahane, 2010). \n\nStreet’s argument has also been challenged by such critics as\nRuss Shafer-Landau (2012). However, her argument, and similar\narguments, have been acknowledged by some moral realists, such as\nDavid Enoch (2011) and Erik Wielenberg (2014) to pose a significant\nproblem for their view.  Enoch, for example, even though he offers a\nresponse to Street’s argument, evidently has some worries about\nthe strength of his reply. Wielenberg, to avoid the criticism that in\na non-theistic universe it would be extremely lucky if evolution\nselected for belief in objectively true moral values, proposes that\nthe natural laws that produce this result may be metaphysically\nnecessary, and thus there is no element of luck.  However, many\nphilosophers will see this view of natural laws as paying a heavy\nprice to avoid theism. It might appear that Street is arguing\nstraightforwardly that evolutionary theory makes it improbable that\nhumans would have objective moral knowledge.  However, it is not\nevolution by itself that predicts the improbability of objective moral\nknowledge, but the conjunction of evolution and metaphysical\nnaturalism. A good deal of the force of Street’s argument stems\nfrom the assumption that naturalism is true, and therefore that the\nevolutionary process is one that is unguided. Since, it is not\nevolution by itself that poses a challenge to moral realism but the\nconjunction of evolution and metaphysical naturalism, then rejecting\nnaturalism provides one way for the moral realist to solve the\nproblem. It does appear that in a naturalistic universe we would\nexpect a process of Darwinian evolution to select for a propensity for\nmoral judgments that track survival and not objective moral truths.\nMark Linville (2009, 391–446) has developed a detailed argument\nfor the claim that it is difficult for metaphysical naturalists to\ndevelop a plausible evolutionary story as to how our moral judgments\ncould have epistemological warrant. However, if we suppose that the\nevolutionary process has been guided by God, who has as one of his\ngoals the creation of morally significant human creatures capable of\nenjoying a relation with God, then it would not seem at all accidental\nor even unlikely that God would ensure that humans have value beliefs\nthat are largely correct. \n\nSome philosophers believe that the randomness of Darwinian natural\nselection rules out the possibility of any kind of divine guidance\nbeing exercised through such a process. Some thinkers, including both\nsome atheists and some proponents of what is called “creation\nscience”, believe that evolution and God are rival, mutually\nexclusive hypotheses about the origins of the natural world. What can\nbe explained scientifically needs no religious explanation. However,\nthis is far from obviously true; in fact, if theism is true it is\nclearly false. From a theistic perspective to think that God and\nscience provide competing explanations fails to grasp the relationship\nbetween God and the natural world by conceiving of God as one more\ncause within that natural world. If God exists at all, God is not an\nentity within the natural world, but the creator of that natural\nworld, with all of its causal processes. If God exists, God is the\nreason why there is a natural world and the reason for the existence\nof the causal processes of the natural world. In principle, therefore,\na natural explanation can never preclude a theistic explanation.  \n\nBut what about the randomness that is a crucial part of the\nDarwinian story? The atheist might claim that because\nevolutionary theory posits that the process by which plants and animals\nhave evolved in one that involves random genetic mutations, it cannot\nbe guided, and thus God cannot have used evolutionary means to achieve\nhis ends. However, this argument fails. It depends on an\nequivocation in what is meant by “random”. When\nscientists claim that genetic mutations are random, they do not mean\nthat they are uncaused, or even that they are unpredictable from the\npoint of view of biochemistry, but only that the mutations do not\nhappen in response to the adaptational needs of the organism. It\nis entirely possible for a natural process to include randomness in\nthat sense, even if the whole natural order is itself created and\nsustained by God. The sense of “randomness” required\nfor evolutionary theory does not imply that the evolutionary process\nmust be unguided. A God who is responsible for the laws of nature\nand the initial conditions that shape the evolutionary process could\ncertainly ensure that the process achieved certain ends. \n\nLike the other moral arguments for God’s existence, the\nargument from moral knowledge can easily be stated in a propositional\nform, and I believe Swinburne is right to hold that the argument is\nbest construed as a probabilistic argument that appeals to God as\nproviding a better explanation of moral knowledge than is possible in a\nnaturalistic universe. \n\nThere is a kind of argument from moral knowledge also implicit in\nAngus Ritchie’s recent book From Morality to Metaphysics: The\nTheistic Implications of our Ethical Commitments (2012).\n Ritchie presses a kind of dilemma on non-theistic accounts of\nmorality. Subjectivist theories such as expressivism can\ncertainly make sense of the fact that we make the ethical judgments we\ndo, but they empty morality of its objective authority. \nObjectivist theories that take morality seriously, however, have\ndifficulty explaining our capacity to make true moral judgments, unless\nthe process by which humans came to hold these capacities is one that\nis controlled by a being such as God. \n\nThe moral argument from knowledge will not be convincing to anyone who\nis committed to any form of expressivism or other non-objective\nmetaethical theory, and clearly many philosophers find such views\nattractive. And there will surely be many philosophers who will judge\nthat if moral objectivism implies theism or requires theism to be\nplausible, this is a\nreductio of objectivist views. Furthermore, non-theistic\nmoral philosophers, whether naturalists or non-naturalists, have\nstories to tell about how moral knowledge might be possible. \nNevertheless, there are real questions about the plausibility of these\nstories, and thus, some of those convinced that moral realism is true\nmay judge that moral knowledge provides some support for theistic\nbelief. \n\nMany philosophers find Immanuel Kant’s moral philosophy still\noffers a fruitful approach to ethics. Of the various forms of the\n“categorical imperative” that Kant offers, the formula that\nregards human beings as “ends in themselves” is especially\nattractive: “Act in such a way that you always treat\nhumanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other,\nnever simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end”\n(Kant 1785 [1964], 96). Many contemporary moral philosophers\ninfluenced by Kant, such as Christine Korsgaard (1996), see Kant as\noffering a “constructivist” metaethical position. \nConstructivism is supposed to offer a “third way” between\nmoral realism and subjectivist views of morality. Like\nsubjectivists, constructivists want to see morality as a human\ncreation. However, like moral realists constructivists want to\nsee moral questions as having objective answers. Constructivism\nis an attempt to develop an objective morality that is free of the\nmetaphysical commitments of moral realism. \n\nIt is, however, controversial whether Kant himself was a\nconstructivist in this sense. One reason to question whether this\nis the right way to read Kant follows from the fact that Kant himself\ndid not see morality as free from metaphysical commitments. For\nexample, Kant thought that it would be impossible for someone who\nbelieved that mechanistic determinism was the literal truth about\nhimself to believe that he was a moral agent, since morality requires\nan autonomy that is incompatible with determinism. To see myself\nas a creature who has the kind of value Kant calls\n“dignity” I must not see myself merely as a machine-like\nproduct of the physical environment. Hence Kant thought that it\nwas crucial for morality that his Critical Philosophy had shown that\nthe deterministic perspective on humans is simply part of the\n“phenomenal world” that is the object of scientific\nknowledge, not the “noumenal reality” that it would be if\nsome kind of scientific realism were the true metaphysical view. \nWhen we do science we see ourselves as determined, but science tells us\nonly how the world appears, not how it really is. Recognizing\nthis fact suggests that when Kant posits that humans have this\nintrinsic value he calls dignity, he is not “constructing”\nthe value humans have, but recognizing the value beings of a certain\nkind must have. Humans can only have this kind of value if they\nare a particular kind of creature. Whether Kant himself was a\nmoral realist or not, there are certainly elements in his philosophy\nthat push in a realist direction. \n\nIf the claim that human persons have a kind of intrinsic dignity or\nworth is a true objective principle and if it provides a key\nfoundational principle of morality, it is well worth asking what kinds\nof metaphysical implications the claim might have. This is the\nquestion that Mark Linville (2009, 417–446) pursues in the second moral\nargument he develops. Linville begins by noting that one could\nhardly hold that “human persons have intrinsic dignity”\ncould be true if human persons do not exist. Clearly, some\nmetaphysical positions do include a denial of the existence of human\npersons, such as forms of Absolute Monism which hold that only one\nAbsolute Reality exists. However, it also seems to be the case\nthat some forms of Scientific Naturalism are committed to the denial of\n“persons as substantive selves that essentially possess\na first-person point of view” (See Dennett 2006, 107). Daniel\nDennett, for example, holds that persons will not be part of the\nultimately true scientific account of things. Dennett holds that\nto think of humans as persons is simply to adopt a certain\n“stance” toward them that he calls the “intentional\nstance,” but it is clear that the kind of picture of humans we\nget when we think of them in this way does not correspond with their\nintrinsic metaphysical properties. It is not clear how systems\ntowards which we adopt an “intentional stance” could be\ntruly autonomous and thus have the kind of value Kant believes human\npersons have. \n\nThe argument from human dignity could be put into propositional form\nas follows: \n\nA naturalist may want to challenge premise (2) by finding some other\nstrategy to explain human dignity. Michael Martin (2002), for\nexample, has tried to suggest that moral judgments can be analyzed as\nthe feelings of approval or disapproval of a perfectly impartial and\ninformed observer. Linville (2009) objects that it is not clear\nhow the feelings of such an observer could constitute the intrinsic\nworth of a person, since one would think that intrinsic properties\nwould be non-relational and mind-independent. In any case,\nLinville notes that a “Euthyphro” problem lurks for such an\nideal observer theory, since one would think that such an observer\nwould judge a person to be intrinsically valuable because the person\nhas intrinsic value. \n\nAnother strategy that is pursued by constructivists such as Korsgaard\nis to link the value ascribed to humans to the capacity for rational\nreflection. The idea is that insofar as I am committed to rational\nreflection, I must value myself as having this capacity, and\nconsistently value others who have it as well. A similar strategy is\nfound in Wielenberg’s form of ethical non-naturalism, since\nWielenberg argues that it is necessarily true that any being with\ncertain reflective capacities will have moral rights (Wielenberg,\n2014, chapter 4). It is far from clear that human rationality provides\nan adequate ground for moral rights, however. Many people believe that\nyoung infants and people suffering from dementia still have this\nintrinsic dignity, but in both cases there is no capacity for rational\nreflection. \n\nSome support for this criticism of the attempt to see reason as the\nbasis of the value of humans can be found in Nicholas\nWolterstorff’s recent work on justice (2007, especially Ch.\n8). Wolterstorff in this work defends the claim that there are\nnatural human rights, and that violating such rights is one way of\nacting unjustly towards a person. Why do humans have such\nrights? Wolterstorff says these rights are grounded in the basic\nworth or dignity that humans possess. When I seek to torture or\nkill an innocent human I am failing to respect this worth. If one\nasks why we should think humans possess such worth, Wolterstorff argues\nthat the belief that humans have this quality was not only historically\nproduced by Jewish and Christian conceptions of the human person, but\neven now cannot be defended apart from such a conception. In\nparticular, he argues that attempts to argue that our worth stems from\nsome excellence we possess such as reason will not explain the worth of\ninfants or those with severe brain injuries or dementia. \n\nDoes a theistic worldview fare better in explaining the special\nvalue of human dignity? In a theistic universe God is himself\nseen as the supreme good. Indeed, theistic Platonists usually\nidentify God with the Good. If God is himself a person, then this\nseems to be a commitment to the idea that personhood itself is\nsomething that must be intrinsically good. If human persons are\nmade in God’s image, as both Judaism and Christianity affirm,\nthen it would seem to follow that humans do have a kind of intrinsic\nvalue, just by way of being the kind of creatures they are. \n\nThis argument will of course be found unconvincing to many.  Some will\ndeny premise (1), either because they reject moral realism as a\nmetaethical stance, or because they reject the normative claim that\nhumans have any kind of special value or dignity. (Maybe they will\neven think that such a claim is a form of “speciesism”.).\nOthers will find premise (2) suspect. They may be inclined to agree\nthat human persons have a special dignity, but hold that the source of\nthat dignity can be found in such human qualities as rationality. With\nrespect to the status of infants and those suffering from dementia,\nthe critic might bite the bullet and just accept the fact that human\ndignity does not extend to them, or else argue that the fact that\ninfants and those suffering mental breakdown are part of a species\nwhose members typically possess rationality merits them a special\nrespect, even if they lack this quality as individuals. Others will\nfind premise (2) doubtful because they find the theistic explanation\nof dignity unclear. Another alternative is to seek a Constructivist\naccount of dignity, perhaps regarding the special status of humans as\nsomething we humans decide to extend to each other. Perhaps the\nstrongest non-theistic alternative would be some form of ethical\nnon-naturalism, in which one simply affirms that the claim that\npersons have a special dignity is an\na priori truth requiring no explanation. In effect this\nis a decision for a non-theistic form of Platonism.  \n\nThe proponent of the argument may well agree that claims about the\nspecial status of humans are true a priori, and thus also opt\nfor some form of Platonism. However, the proponent of the\nargument will point out that some necessary truths can be explained by\nother necessary truths. The theist believes that these truths\nabout the special status of humans tell us something about the kind of\nuniverse humans find themselves in. To say that humans are\ncreated by God is to say that personhood is not an ephemeral or\naccidental feature of the universe, because at bottom reality itself is\npersonal (Mavrodes 1986). \n\nAs already noted, the most famous and perhaps most influential version\nof a moral argument for belief in God is found in Immanuel Kant\n(1788). Kant himself insisted that his argument was not a theoretical\nargument, but an argument grounded in practical reason. The conclusion\nof the argument is not “God exists” or “God probably\nexists” but “I (as a rational, moral agent) ought to\nbelieve that God exists.” We shall, however, see that there are\nsome reasons to doubt that practical arguments can be neatly separated\nfrom theoretical arguments. \n\nKant’s version of the argument can be stated in different\nways, but perhaps the following captures one plausible interpretation\nof the argument. Morality is grounded in pure practical reason,\nand the moral agent must act on the basis of maxims that can be\nrationally endorsed as universal principles. Moral actions are\nthus not determined by results or consequences but by the maxims on\nwhich they are based. However, all actions, including moral\nactions, necessarily aim at ends. Kant argues that the end that\nmoral actions aim at is the “highest good,” which is a\nworld in which both moral virtue and happiness are maximized, with\nhappiness contingent on virtue. For Kant “ought implies\ncan,” and so if I have an obligation to seek the highest good,\nthen I must believe that it is possible to achieve such an end. \nHowever, I must seek the highest good only by acting in accordance with\nmorality; no shortcuts to happiness are permissible. This seems\nto require that I believe that acting in accordance with morality will\nbe causally efficacious in achieving the highest good. However,\nit is reasonable to believe that moral actions will be causally\nefficacious in this way only if the laws of causality are set up in\nsuch a way that these laws are conducive to the efficacy of moral\naction. Certainly both parts of the highest good seem difficult\nto achieve. We humans have weaknesses in our character that\nappear difficult if not impossible to overcome by our own\nefforts. Furthermore, as creatures we have subjective needs that\nmust be satisfied if we are happy, but we have little empirical reason\nto think that these needs will be satisfied by moral actions even if we\nsucceeded in becoming virtuous. If a person believes that the\nnatural world is simply a non-moral machine with no moral purposiveness\nthen that person would have no reason to believe that moral action\ncould succeed because there is no a priori reason to think\nmoral action will achieve the highest good and little empirical reason\nto believe this either. Kant thus concludes that a moral agent\nmust “postulate” the existence of God as a rational\npresupposition of the moral life. \n\nOne problem with this argument is that many will deny that morality\nrequires us to seek the highest good in Kant’s sense. Even\nif the Kantian highest good seems reasonable as an ideal, some will\nobject that we have no obligation to achieve such a state, but merely\nto work towards realizing the closest approximation to such a state\nthat is possible (See Adams 1987, 152). Without divine\nassistance, perhaps perfect virtue is unachievable, but in that case we\ncannot be obliged to realize such a state if there is no God. \nPerhaps we cannot hope that happiness will be properly proportioned to\nvirtue in the actual world if God does not exist, but then our\nobligation can only be to realize as much happiness as can be attained\nthrough moral means. Kant would doubtless reject this criticism,\nsince on his view the ends of morality are given directly to pure\npractical reason a priori, and we are not at liberty to adjust\nthose ends on the basis of empirical beliefs.  However,\nfew contemporary philosophers would share Kant’s confident view\nof reason here, and thus to many the criticism has force. Even\nKant admits at one point that full-fledged belief in God is not\nrationally necessary, since one could conceivably seek the highest good\nif one merely believes that God’s existence is possible (Kant,\n1781–1787, 651). \n\nAnother way of interpreting Kant’s argument puts more stress\non the connection between an individual’s desire for happiness\nand the obligation to do what is morally right. Morality requires\nme to sacrifice my personal happiness if that is necessary to do what\nis right. Yet it is a psychological fact that humans necessarily\ndesire their own happiness. In such a state it looks as if human\nmoral agents will be torn by what Henry Sidgwick called the\n“dualism of the practical reason” (1884, 401). Reason\nboth requires humans to seek their own happiness and to sacrifice\nit. Sidgwick himself noted that only if there is a God can we\nhope that this dualism will be resolved, so that those who seek to act\nmorally will in the long run also be acting so as to advance their own\nhappiness and well-being. (Interestingly, Sidgwick himself does\nnot endorse this argument, but he clearly sees this problem as part of\nthe appeal of theism.) A contemporary argument similar to this\none has been developed by C. Stephen Layman (2002). \n\nThe critic of this form of the Kantian argument may reply that\nKantian morality sees duty as something that must be done regardless of\nthe consequences, and thus a truly moral person cannot make his or her\ncommitment to morality contingent on the achievement of\nhappiness. From a Kantian point of view, this reply seems right;\nKant unequivocally affirms that moral actions must be done for the sake\nof duty and not from any desire for personal reward. \nNevertheless, especially for any philosopher willing to endorse any\nform of eudaimonism, seeing myself as inevitably sacrificing what I\ncannot help but desire for the sake of duty does seem\nproblematic. As John Hare affirms, “If we are to endorse\nwholeheartedly the long-term shape of our lives, we have to see this\nshape as consistent with our happiness” (1996, 88). \n\nThe critic may reply to this by simply accepting the lamentable fact\nthat there is something tragic or even absurd about the human\ncondition. The world may not be the world we wish it was, but\nthat does not give us any reason to believe it is different than it\nis. If there is a tension between the demands of morality and\nself-interest, then this may simply be a brute fact that must be\nfaced. \n\nThis reply raises an issue that must be faced by all forms of\npractical or pragmatic arguments for belief. Many philosophers\ninsist that rational belief must be grounded solely in theoretical\nevidence. The fact that it would be better for me to believe p\ndoes not in itself give me any reason to believe p. This\ncriticism is aimed not merely at Kant, but at other practical moral\narguments. For example, Robert Adams argues that if humans\nbelieve there is no moral order to the universe, then they will become\ndemoralized in their pursuit of morality, which is morally undesirable\n(1987, 151). The atheist might concede that atheism is (somewhat)\ndemoralizing, but deny that this provides any reason to believe there\nis a moral order to the universe. Similarly, Linda Zagzebski\n(1987) argues that morality will not be a rational enterprise unless\ngood actions increase the amount of good in the world. However,\ngiven that moral actions often involve the sacrifice of happiness,\nthere is no reason to believe moral action will increase the good\nunless there is a power transcendent of human activity working on the\nside of the good. Here the atheist may claim that moral action\ndoes increase the good because such actions always increase good\ncharacter. However, even if that reply fails the atheist may\nagain simply admit that there may be something tragic or absurd about\nthe human condition, and the fact that we may wish things were\ndifferent is not a reason to believe that they are. So the\nproblem must be faced: Are practical arguments merely\nrationalized wish-fulfillment? \n\nThe theist might respond to this kind of worry in several\nways. The first thing to be said is that the fact that a\nnaturalistic view of the universe implies that the universe must be\ntragic or absurd, if correct, would itself be an important and\ninteresting conclusion. However, apart from this, it makes a\ngreat deal of difference how one construes what we might call the\nbackground epistemic situation. If one believes that our\ntheoretical evidence favors atheism, then it seems plausible to hold\nthat one ought to maintain a naturalistic view, even if it is\npractically undesirable that the world have such a character. In\nthat case a practical argument for religious belief could be judged a\nform of wish-fulfillment. However, this does not seem to be the\nway those who support such a practical argument see the\nsituation. Kant affirms that the limits of reason established in\nThe Critique of Pure Reason would silence all objections to\nmorality and religion “in Socratic fashion, namely, by the\nclearest proof of the ignorance of the objectors” (1781, 1787,\n30. See also 530–531.) In fact, the situation actually\nfavors theism, since Kant holds that theoretical reason sees value in\nthe concept of God as a regulative ideal, even though God’s\nexistence cannot be theoretically affirmed as knowledge. If we\nappeal to God’s will to explain what happens in the natural\norder, we undermine both science and religion, since in that case we\nwould no longer seek empirical evidence for causality and we would make\nGod into a finite object in the natural world (1781, 1787,\n562–563). However, as a regulative ideal, the concept of God is\none that theoretical reason finds useful: “The assumption of a\nsupreme intelligence, as the one and only cause of the universe, though\nin the idea alone, can therefore always benefit reason and can never\ninjure it” (1781, 1787, 560). There is a sense in which\ntheoretical reason itself inclines towards affirmation of God, because\nit must assume that reality is rationally knowable: “If one\nwishes to achieve systematic knowledge of the world, he ought to regard\nit as if it were created by a supreme reason.” (Kant 1786, 298)\nAlthough theoretical reason cannot affirm the existence of God, it\nfinds it useful to think of the natural world as having the kinds of\ncharacteristics it would have if God did exist. Thus, if rational\ngrounds for belief in God come from practical reason, theoretical\nreason will raise no objections. \n\nFor Kant the argument from practical reason for belief in God is not\na form of wish-fulfillment because its ground is not an arbitrary\ndesire or wish but “a real need associated with reason”\n(Kant, 1786, 296). Human beings are not purely theoretical\nspectators of the universe, but agents. It is not always rational\nor even possible to refrain from action, and yet action presupposes\nbeliefs about the way things are (For a good interpretation and defense\nof this view of Kant on the relation between action and belief, see\nWood 1970, 17–25). Thus, in some cases suspension of judgment is\nnot possible. The critic may object that a person may act as if p\nwere true without believing p. However, it is not clear that this\nadvice to distinguish action on the basis of p and belief that p can\nalways be followed. For one thing, it seems empirically the case\nthat one way of acquiring belief that p is simply to begin to act as if\np were true. Hence, to begin to act as if p were true is at least\nto embark upon a course of action that makes belief in p more\nlikely. Second, there may well be a sense of “belief”\nin which “acting as if p were true” is sufficient to\nconstitute belief. This is obviously the case on pragmatist\naccounts of belief. But even those who reject a general pragmatic\naccount of belief may well find something like this appealing with\nrespect to religious belief. Many religious believers hold that\nthe best way to measure a person’s religious faith is in terms of\nthe person’s actions. Thus, a person who is willing to act\non the basis of a religious conception, especially if those actions are\nrisky or costly, is truly a religious believer, even if that person is\nfilled with doubt and anxiety. Such a person might well be\nconstrued as more truly a believer than a person who smugly\n“assents” to religious doctrines but is unwilling to act on\nthem. \n\nPerhaps the right way to think of practical moral arguments is not\nto see them as justifying belief without evidence, but as shifting the\namount of evidence seen as necessary. This is the lesson some\nwould draw from the phenomenon of “pragmatic encroachment”\nthat has been much discussed in recent epistemology. Here is an\nexample of pragmatic encroachment: \n\nA plausible interpretation of this scenario is that ordinarily\nclaims such as the one I made, based on memory, are justified, and\ncount as knowledge. However, in this situation, the stakes are\nraised because my life is at risk, and my knowledge is lost because the\npragmatic situation has “encroached” on the normal\ntruth-oriented conditions for knowledge. Pragmatic encroachment\nis controversial and the idea of such encroachment is rejected by some\nepistemologists. However, defenders hold that it is reasonable to\nconsider the pragmatic stakes in considering evidence for a belief that\nunderlies significant action (see Fantl and McGrath 2007). If\nthis is correct, then it seems reasonable to consider the pragmatic\nsituation in determining how much evidence is sufficient to justify\nreligious beliefs. In theory the adjustment could go in either\ndirection, depending on what costs are associated with a mistake and on\nwhich side those costs lie. \n\nIn any case it is not clear that practical moral arguments can\nalways be clearly distinguished from theoretical moral arguments. \nThe reason this is so is that in many cases the practical situation\ndescribed seems itself to be or involve a kind of evidence for the\ntruth of the belief being justified. Take, for example,\nKant’s classic argument. One thing Kant’s argument\ndoes is call to our attention that it would be enormously odd to\nbelieve that human beings are moral creatures subject to an objective\nmoral law, but also to believe that the universe that humans inhabit is\nindifferent to morality. In other words, the existence of human\npersons understood as moral beings can itself be understood as a piece\nof evidence about the character of the universe humans find themselves\nin. Peter Byrne (2013, 1998) has criticized practical arguments on\nthe grounds that they presuppose something like the following\nproposition: “The world is likely to be organized so as to\nmeet our deepest human needs.” Byrne objects that this premise is\nlikely to be false if there is no God and thus arguments that assume it\nappear circular. However, it is not clear that only those who\nalready believe in God will find this premise attractive. The\nreason for this is that humans are themselves part of the natural\nuniverse, and it seems a desirable feature of a metaphysical view that\nit explain (rather than explain away) features of human existence that\nseem real and important. \n\nIt seems likely therefore that any appeal to a practical argument\nwill include some theoretical component as well, even if that component\nis not always made explicit. Nevertheless, this does not mean\nthat practical arguments do not have some important and distinctive\nfeatures. For Kant it was important that religious beliefs stem\nfrom practical reason. For if religious belief were grounded\nsolely in theoretical reason, then such belief would have to conform to\n“extrinsic and arbitrary legislation” (Kant 1790,\n131). Kant thinks such a religion would be one grounded in\n“fear and submission,” and thus it is good that religious\nbelief is motivated mainly by a free moral act by which the\n“final end of our being” is presented to us (1790,\n159). For any practical argument makes religious belief\nexistential; the issue is not merely what I believe to be true about\nthe universe but how I shall live my life in that universe. \n\nIt seems clear that no version of the moral argument constitutes a\n“proof” of God’s existence. Each version\ncontains premises that many reasonable thinkers reject. However,\nthis does not mean the arguments have no force. One might think\nof each version of the argument as attempting to spell out the\n“cost” of rejecting the conclusion. Some philosophers\nwill certainly be willing to pay the cost, and indeed have independent\nreasons for doing so. However, it would certainly be interesting\nand important if one became convinced that atheism required one to\nreject moral realism altogether, or to embrace an implausible account\nof how moral knowledge is acquired. For those who think that some\nversion or versions of the arguments have force, the cumulative case\nfor theistic belief may be raised by such arguments.","contact.mail":"C_Stephen_Evans@baylor.edu","contact.domain":"baylor.edu"}]
