This is no accident: obligations are central to\nthe social role of law and explaining them is necessary to an\nunderstanding of law's authority and, therefore, its nature. Not only\nare there obligations in the law, there are also obligations\nto the law. Historically, most philosophers agreed that these\ninclude a moral obligation to obey, or what is usually called\n“political obligation.” Voluntarists maintained that this\nrequires something like a voluntary subjection to law's rule, for\nexample, through consent. Non-voluntarists denied this, insisting that\nthe value of a just and effective legal system is itself sufficient to\nvalidate law's claims. Both lines of argument have recently come under\nintense scrutiny, and some philosophers now deny that law is entitled\nto all the authority it claims for itself, even when the legal system\nis legitimate and reasonably just. On this view there are legal\nobligations that some of law's subjects have no moral obligation to\nperform.\n\n\n\nEvery legal system contains obligation-imposing laws, but there is\nno decisive linguistic marker determining which these are. The term\n“obligation” need not be used, nor its near-synonym,\n“duty.” One rarely finds the imperative mood. The Canadian\nCriminal Code imposes an obligation not to advocate genocide thus:\n“Every one who advocates or promotes genocide is guilty of an\nindictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding\nfive years.” The English Sale of Goods Act says that,\n“Where the seller sells goods in the course of a business, there\nis an implied condition that the goods supplied under the contract are\nof merchantable quality.” That these laws create\nobligations follows from the way “offence” and\n“implied condition” function in their respective areas of\nlaw, not from the language in which they are expressed. \n\nOn the face of it, some laws have other functions. A requirement\nthat “a will must be signed” generally imposes no \nduty—not a duty to make a will, and not even a duty to have it\nsigned if you do—it sets conditions in the absence of which the\ndocument simply does not count as a valid will. Nonetheless, some\nphilosophers, including Jeremy Bentham and Hans Kelsen, argue that the\ncontent of every legal system can and should be represented solely in\nterms of duty-imposing and duty-excepting laws. Bentham asks,\n“What is it that every article of law has in common with the\nrest? It commands and by doing so creates duties or, what is\nanother word for the same thing, obligations” (Bentham 1970,\n294). (For a related contemporary view, see Harris 1979, 84–106.) They think\nthat analyzing laws this way reveals what legislators or subjects most\nneed to know: under what conditions the coercive power of law will\nultimately be met. Others argue that even if such a reduction were\npossible, it would be unwieldy, uninformative and unmotivated,\nconcealing as it does the different social functions that laws fulfil\n(Hart 1994: 26–49) and the different kinds of reasons for action that\nthey create (Raz 1990). Others still, despairing of any principled way\nof knowing what a law is, have abandoned the problem entirely and tried\nto develop a theory of law that bypasses it (Honoré 1977; Dworkin\n1978: 71–78). At a minimum, it does seem clear that whether or not all\nlaws impose obligations, they can only be fully understood\nthrough their relations to those that do. Thus, a legal right is an\ninterest that warrants holding others under an obligation to protect\nit, a legal power is the ability to create or modify obligations, and\nso forth. \n\nWhat then are legal obligations? They are legal requirements with\nwhich law's subjects are bound to conform. An obligatory act\nor omission is something the law renders non-optional. Since people\nplainly can violate their legal obligations,\n“non-optional” does not mean that they are physically\ncompelled to perform, nor even that law leaves them without any\neligible alternative. On the contrary, people often calculate whether\nor not to perform their legal duties. Could it be then that obligations\nare simply weighty reasons to perform, even if sometimes neglected or\noutweighed? This cannot be a sufficient condition: high courts have\nimportant reasons not to reverse themselves too frequently, but no\nlegal obligation to refrain. Nor is it necessary: one has an\nobligation, but only a trivial reason, not to tread on someone's lawn\nwithout his consent. \n\nIf their content does not account for the stringency of obligations,\nwhat does? An historically important, though now largely defunct,\ntheory explained it in terms of penalty. Following Hobbes and Bentham,\nthe English jurist John Austin says that to have a legal obligation is\nto be subject to a sovereign command to do or forbear, where a command\nrequires an expression of will together with an attached risk, however\nsmall, of suffering an evil for non-compliance. “When I am\ntalking directly of the chance of incurring the evil, or\n(changing the expression) of the liability or obnoxiousness to the\nevil, I employ the term duty, or the term\nobligation…” (Austin 1832, 18). Others conceived an\nindirect connection between duty and sanction. Hans Kelsen holds that\nwhat is normally counted as the content of a legal duty is in reality\nonly part of a triggering condition for the mandatory norm which\ncommands or authorizes officials to impose a sanction: “[A] norm:\n‘You shall not murder’ is superfluous, if a norm is valid:\n‘He who murders ought to be punished’”(Kelsen 1967, 55).\nAnd thus, “Legal obligation is not, or not immediately, the\nbehavior that ought to be. Only the coercive act, functioning as a\nsanction, ought to be” (Kelsen 1967, 119). \n\nNone of these versions of the sanction theory survived H.L.A. Hart's\ncriticisms (Hart 1994, 27–42; cf. Hacker 1973). First, they misleadingly\nrepresent a range of disparate legal consequences—including\ncompensation and even invalidation—as if they all function as\npenalties. Second, they render unintelligible many familiar references\nto duties in the absence of sanctions, for example, the duty of the\nhighest courts to apply the law. Third, they offer an inadequate\nexplanation of non-optionality. “You have an obligation not to\nmurder” cannot merely mean “If you murder you will be\npunished,” for the law is not indifferent between people, on the\none hand, murdering and being jailed, and on the other hand not\nmurdering at all. “The right to disobey the law is not obtainable\nby the payment of a penalty or a licence fee” (Francome v.\nMirror Group Newspapers Ltd. [1984] 2 All ER 408 at 412). Such\ndicta are commonplace and reflect familiar judicial attitudes. Most\nimportant, the normal function of sanctions in the law is to reinforce\nduties, not to constitute them. It is true that one reason\npeople are interested in knowing their legal duties is to avoid\nsanctions, but this is not the only reason nor is it, contrary to what\nOliver Wendell Holmes supposed, a theoretically primary one. Subjects\nalso want to be guided by their duties—whether in\norder to fulfil them or deliberately to infringe them—and\nofficials invoke them as reasons for, and not merely\nconsequences of, their decisions. \n\nSensitivity to such matters led Hart to defend a rule-based\ntheory. He says that while sanctions might mark circumstances in which\npeople are obligedto conform, they have an obligation\nonly when subject to a practiced social rule requiring an act or\nomission. The fact that subjects use it as a rule marks it as\nnormative. Three further features distinguish obligation-imposing\nrules: they must be reinforced by serious or insistent pressure to\nconform; they must be believed important to social life or to some\nvalued aspect of it; and their requirements may conflict with the\ninterests and goals of the subject (Hart 1994, 85–88). This account of\nthe nature of obligations is not an account of their\nvalidity. Hart does not say that a legal duty is binding\nwhenever there is a willingness to deploy serious pressure in its\nsupport, etc. He holds that a duty is legally valid if it is part of\nthe legal system (i.e., if it is certified as such by the tests for law\nin that system), and a legal duty is morally valid only if there are\nsound moral reasons to comply with it. But, at least in his early work,\nhe offers the practice theory as an explanation of duties \ngenerally—legal duties are the creatures of legal rules, moral duties of\nmoral rules and so on. (Hart later modified this view, see 1982,\n255–68; and 1994, 256.) \n\nThe constitutive role of social pressure is sometimes considered an\nAustinian blemish on Hart's theory, but there are in any case more\nserious problems with it as a general account of obligations (Dworkin\n1978, 50–54; Raz 1990, 53–8). People readily speak of obligations when\nthey are well aware that there are no relevant social practices, as\nmight a lone vegetarian in a meat eating society. And Hart's practice\nconditions may be satisfied in cases where there is no obligation but\nonly generally applicable reasons, as when victims are regularly urged\nto yield their wallets to a mugger. At best, Hart's theory will apply\nonly to a special class of obligations in which the existence of a\nconventional practice is an essential part of the reasons for\nconformity, though even here, the theory is open to doubt. (See Dworkin\n1978, 54–58; Green 1988, 88–121) \n\nA third account is reason-based. On this view, what\nconstitutes obligations is neither the social resources with which they\nare enforced, nor the practices in which they may be expressed, but the\nkind of reasons for action that they offer. Legal obligations are\ncontent-independent reasons that are both categorical and pre-emptive\nin force. The mark of their content-independence is that their force\ndoes not depend on the nature or merits of the action they require: in\nmost cases, law can impose an obligation to do X or to refrain\nfrom doing X (Hart 1958; 1982, 254–55; but cf. Markwick 2000).\nThat they are pre-emptive means that they require the subject to set\naside his own view of the merits and comply nonetheless. That they are\ncategorical means that they do not condition their claims on the\nsubject's own goals or interests. \n\nThis view is foreshadowed in both Hobbes and Locke, but its most\ninfluential contemporary version is due to Joseph Raz (1977; 1990,\n35–84). He argues that obligations are categorical reasons for action\nthat are also protected by exclusionary reasons not to act on\nsome of the competing reasons to the contrary. Obligations exclude\nsome contrary reasons—typically at least reasons of\nconvenience and ordinary preference—but they do not normally\nexclude all: an exclusionary reason is not necessarily a conclusive\nreason. The stringency of an obligation is thus a consequence not of\nits weight or practice features, but of the fact that it supports the\nrequired action by special normative means, insulating it from the\ngeneral competition of reasons. Or at any rate this is what obligations\ndo when they have the force the claim, i.e., when they are binding. The\ntheory does not assume that all legal obligations actually are binding\nfrom the moral point of view, but it does suppose that the legal system\nputs them forth as if they were—a consequence that some have\ndoubted. (Hart 1982, 263–67; Himma 2001, 284–97) And while this account is\ninvulnerable to the objections to sanction-based and practice-based\ntheories, it does need to make good the general idea of an\n‘exclusionary reason’, and some philosophers have expressed\ndoubts on that score also (Perry 1989, Regan 1987): is it ever reasonable to\nexclude entirely from consideration an otherwise valid reason?\nThe account has, nonetheless, been adopted by legal philosophers with\notherwise starkly contrasting views of the nature of law. (Compare,\ne.g., Finnis 1979, 231–59 and Marmor 2001). \n\nA competitive market is not a legal system, even though people\nadjust their behaviour in response to relative prices and the whole\nconstitutes a form of social order. Neither was the system of mutual\nnuclear deterrence, though it guided behaviour and generated norms that\nregulated the Cold War. Many philosophers and social scientists agree\nthat a social order is a legal system only if it has effective\nauthority. An effective (or de facto) authority may\nnot be justified, but it does stand in a special relation to justified\n(de jure) authority. Justified authority is what effective\nauthorities claim, or what they are generally recognized to have. \n\nWhat is legal authority, and how is it related to obligations? It is\na kind of practical authority, i.e. authority over action. On one\ninfluential view, “To claim authority is to claim the right to be\nobeyed” (Wolff 1970, 5). There are, of course, authorities that make\nno such claim. Theoretical authorities, i.e., experts, are not\ncharacterized by claims to obedience—they need not even claim a\nright to be believed. And there are weaker forms of practical\nauthority. To give someone authority to use your car is merely to\npermit him. But political authority, of which legal authority is one\nspecies, is normally seen as a right to rule, with a correlative duty\nto obey. On this account law claims the right to obedience wherever it\nsets out obligations. And to obey is not merely to comply with the law;\nit is to be guided by it. Max Weber says it is “as if\nthe ruled had made the content of the command the maxim of their\nconduct for its very own sake” (Weber 1963, 946). Or, as Robert Paul\nWolff somewhat more perspicuously puts it: “Obedience is not a\nmatter of doing what someone tells you to do. It is a matter of doing\nwhat he tells you to do because he tells you to do it”\n(Wolff 1970, 9). This is not to say that one obeys only in treating the\nauthority's say-so as an indefeasible reason for action; but one must\ntreat as a binding content-independent reason. The question whether\nthere is an obligation of obedience to law is a matter of whether we\nshould act from the legal point of view and obey the law as it claims\nto be obeyed (Raz 1979, 233–49). \n\nIt is an interesting feature of this account that it supposes that\none can tell what the authority requires independent of whether the\nrequirement is justified on its merits. Richard Friedman argues:\n“[I]f there is no way of telling whether an utterance is\nauthoritative, except by evaluating its contents to see whether it\ndeserves to be accepted in its own right, then the distinction between\nan authoritative utterance and advice or rational persuasion will have\ncollapsed” (Friedman 1973, 132). An idea of this sort is developed by\nRaz into one of the leading arguments for the “sources\nthesis”, the idea that an adequate test for the existence and\ncontent of law must be based only on social facts, and not on moral\narguments. (See the entry on \n  legal positivism.) Authority's subjects\n“can benefit by its decisions only if they can establish their\nexistence and content in ways which do not depend on raising the very\nsame issues which the authority is there to settle” (Raz 1994,\n219). If law aims to settle disputes about moral issues, then law must\nbe identifiable without resolving these same disputes. The law is\ntherefore exhausted by its sources (such as legislative\nenactments, judicial decisions, and customs, together with local\nconventions of interpretation). This kind of argument has been\ngeneralized (see Shapiro 1998), but also subjected to criticism. It is\nuncertain what sort of constraint is posed by the idea that it should\nnot involve “the very same issues”—perhaps if\nmorality is a necessary condition only there could be moral tests for\nauthority that leave the relevant dependent reasons untouched (Coleman 2001,\n126–7). And while law does indeed serve as a scheme for guiding and\nappraising behaviour, it may also have other functions, such as\neducating its subjects about right and wrong, and this may be\nill-served the attitude that the rules are to be obeyed in part because\nthey are the rules (Waluchow 1994). \n\nThe obligation-correlative view of authority is not universally\naccepted. Some argue that legal authority involves no claim right, but\nonly a set of liberties: to decide certain questions for a society and\nto enforce their decisions. (Soper 2002, 85 ff; cf. Ladenson 1980; Greenawalt 1987;\n47–61; and Edmundson 1998, 7–70). The liberty conception must answer two\nquestions. First, is it not a feature of a right to decide that it\nrequires subjects to refrain from acting on competing decisions? If the\nlaw says that abortion is permissible and the Church says that it is\nnot, what does the denial of the Church's right to decide amount to if\nnot that public policy should be structured by the former decision and\nnot the latter, even if the latter is correct? Second, does the right\nto enforce include a duty of subjects to pay the penalty when required?\nIf it does, then this is only a truncated version of the\nobligation-correlative theory—one that holds that punitive and\nremedial obligations, but not primary obligations, are binding. If not,\nit is starkly at variance with the actual views of legal officials, who\ndo not think that subjects are at liberty to evade penalties if they\ncan. \n\nThis reaches a methodological issue in the philosophy of law. Some\nconsider that the character of law's authority is a matter for\ndescriptive analysis fixed by semantic and logical constraints of\nofficial language and traditions of argument. Others maintain that such\nanalysis is impossible or indeterminate, and that we are therefore\ndriven to normative arguments about what legal authority should be\n(see Soper 2002; Finnis 1979, 12–15). Crudely put, they think that we should\nunderstand law to claim only the sort of authority it would be\njustifiable for law to have. Such is the motivation for Friedrich\nHayek's suggestion that ‘The ideal type of law … provides\nmerely additional information to be taken into account in the decision\nof the actor’ (Hayek 1960, 150). Hayek favours the free market, and\nconcludes that the nature of legal authority should be understood\nanalogically. The most radical position of this sort is Ronald\nDworkin's. He prefers what he calls a “more relaxed”\nunderstanding of legal authority (Dworkin 1986: 429). Others have\nargued that the pre-emptive notion of authority is unsatisfactory\nbecause it is too rigid (e.g., Perry 1989). Dworkin's objection runs much\ndeeper. His position is not that law communicates only a weaker form of\nguidance; it is that law is not to be understood as trying to\ncommunicate anything at all. A subject considering his legal duties is\nnot listening to the law; he is engaged in “a conversation with\noneself,” and is “ trying to discover his own intention in\nmaintaining and participating in that practice” (Dworkin 1986,\n58). On this view there is no fact of the matter about what law claims\nthat is independent of what each does well to regard it as\nclaiming. \n\nHowever we resolve the methodological question, there are two\nparallel normative questions: \n\nWhat is the relationship between these? Some maintain that\nobligation comes first: “[T]hough obligation is not a sufficient\ncondition for coercion, it is close to a necessary one. A state may\nhave good grounds in some special circumstances for coercing those who\nhave no duty to obey. But no general policy of upholding the law with\nsteel could be justified if the law were not, in general, a source of\ngenuine obligations” (Dworkin 1986, 191). The idea is that\nmerely having justice on one's side is an inadequate ground for\ncoercing others; one also needs a special title flowing from the moral\nstatus of the law. (Contrast, for example, Locke's view that everyone\nhas an “executive power of the law of nature,” at least\noutside political society (§ 13).) \n\nOthers contend that this gets the relationship backwards. First, it\nis doubtful whether one could have an obligation to obey an\nillegitimate regime. As Rawls says, “[A]cquiesence in, or even\nconsent to, clearly unjust institutions does not give rise to\nobligations” (Rawls 1971, 343; but cf. Simmons 1979, 78–79). If\nso, at least some conditions of legitimacy precede an obligation of\nobedience. Second, there are substantive reasons for thinking we would\nnot have obligations to obey if the law were not already\njustified in upholding its requirements “with steel.” A\nlegal system that could not justifiably coerce could not assure the\nlaw-abiding that the recalcitrant will not take them for suckers.\nWithout being able to solve this assurance problem it would be unjust\nto impose obligations on them, and unjust to demand their obedience.\nUnderlying this suggestion is that idea that familiar idea that\neffectiveness is a necessary—but certainly not \nsufficient—condition for justified authority. (See Kelsen 1967, 46–50; cf.\nFinnis 1979, 250) \n\nIt may affirm our confidence in the obligation-correlative view to\nknow that from earliest times philosophical reflection on political\nauthority has focussed on the obligation to obey. The passive\nobligation of obedience is certainly not all we owe the law (Parekh 1993, 243;\nGreen 2003, 543–47) but many have taken it to be law's minimum demand.\nThis gives rise to a puzzle. As Wolff puts it: “If the individual\nretains his autonomy by reserving to himself in each instance the final\ndecision whether to co-operate, he thereby denies the authority of the\nstate; if, on the other hand, he submits to the state and accepts is\nclaim to authority then … he loses his autonomy” (Wolff 1970,\n9). Wolff resolves the dilemma in favour of autonomy, and on that basis\ndefends anarchism. \n\nSome of Wolff's worries flow from the “surrender of\njudgement” itself—how can it ever be rational to act\nagainst reason as one sees it? Others flow from the fact that it is a\nsurrender to the law. On the first point, it is relevant to\nnotice that promises and contracts also involve surrender of judgement\nand a kind of deference to others (see Soper 2002, 103–39), yet a rational\nanarchist needs such voluntary commitments to substitute for\nauthoritative ordering. A principled objection to every surrender of\njudgment is thus self-defeating. Moreover, there seem to be cases in\nwhich by surrendering judgement on some matters one can secure more\ntime and resources for reflection and decision on things that are more\nimportant, or with respect to which one has greater capacity for\nself-direction. A partial surrender of judgment may therefore enhance\nthe agent's autonomy overall. \n\nThis suggests that Wolff's concern is better understood as\nscepticism about whether it is justifiable to surrender one's judgment\nwholesale to the law. Some philosophers have queried the\nintelligibility of this doubt; they say that it is of the\nnature of law that there is an obligation to obey it, at least\nin its central case (Fuller 1958, 100; Finnis 1979, 14–15). Some go so far as to\nconclude that it is therefore absurd to ask for any ground of\nthe duty to obey the law: law is that which is to be obeyed (McPherson 1967,\n64). We need a way into this circle, and the best entrance is in\nspecifying the nature of law in a way compatible with various theories\nof its nature. Three features are especially important (drawing on Hart\n1994, 193–200; Raz 1990, 149–54; and Lyons 1984, 66–68.) First, law is\ninstitutionalized: nothing is law that is not connected with\nthe activities of institutions such as legislatures, courts,\nadministrators, police, etc. Second, legal systems have a wide\nscope. Law not limited to the affairs of small face-to-face groups\nsuch as families or clans, nor does it only attend to a restricted\ndomain of life such as baseball. Law governs open-ended domains of\nlarge, loosely structured groups of strangers and it regulates their\nmost urgent interests: life, liberty, property, kinship, etc. But\nalthough law necessarily deals with moral matters, it does not\nnecessarily do so well, and this is its third central feature: law is\nmorally fallible. This is acknowledged by both positivists and\nnatural lawyers, whose slogan “an unjust law is not a law”\nwas never intended to assert the infallibility of law. \n\nThe question of political obligation, then, turns on whether there\nis are moral reasons to obey the mandatory requirements of a\nwide-ranging, morally fallible, institutionalized authority. This\nobligation purports to be comprehensive in that it covers all legal\nobligations and everyone whose compliance the law requires. It is not\nassumed to bind come what may, though it is to be one genuine\nobligation among others. Some philosophers also consider that it should\nbind people particularly to their own states, i.e., the states of which\nthey are residents or citizens, and that an argument that could not\nshow that one had more stringent duties to obey one's own country than\na similarly just foreign one would be in that measure deficient\n(Simmons 1979, 31–35; Green 1988, 227–28). Finally, it is common ground the\nobligation exists only when a threshold condition of justice is\nmet. \n\nA theory of political obligation is non-voluntarist if its\nprinciples justifying legal authority do not invoke the choice or will\nof the subjects among its reasons for thinking they are bound to obey.\nThree such arguments have some currency. \n\n“[W]hy should I obey the government is an absurd question. We\nhave not understood what it means to be a member of political\nsociety if we suppose that political obligation is something we might\nnot have had and that therefore needs to be justified”\n(McPherson 1967, 64). On this view, the many attempts to find independent\nmoral principles to justify obligation are not merely mistaken, they\nare conceptually confused; they exhibit a “symptom of\nphilosophical disorder” (Pitkin 1965, 75). The matter is resolved by\nattending to the meaning of “member”. It is hard to find\nphilosophers who still think that normative questions can be resolved\nby linguistic considerations, but there are, surprisingly, some who do\nthink that this argument strategy is essentially correct. Ronald\nDworkin, for instance, claims, “Political association, like\nfamily or friendship and other forms of association more local and\nintimate, is itself pregnant of obligation” (Dworkin 1986, 206).\nHis obstetrical theory is parthenogenetic: politics is a form of\nassociation that in itself bears obligations. Having a virgin\nbirth, obligation has no father among familiar moral principles such as\nconsent, utility, fairness, and so on. We justify it by showing how it\nis a kind of “associative” or “communal”\nobligation constitutive of a certain kind of community. \n\nPeople in organic associations do often feel obligations to other\nmembers, but we normally seek an independent ground to justify them\n(see Simmons 1996; Wellman 1997). One version focuses on the value of\nobligations attached to social roles. The duty to obey is there\nexplained by giving an account of the social role involved, for\ninstance “member”, “citizen,” or\n“subject”. It is important to see that there is not one\nproblem here, but two. There is a matter of content: what does\nthe political role actually require? And there is the matter of\nvalidity: what makes these requirements binding on its\noccupants? (See Hardimon 1994.) But these are intimately linked: one cannot\nsolve the second independently of the first. There is no\ngeneral answer to the question why role duties bind—it\ndepends on the roles and the duties. \n\nDworkin, in contrast, believes we do generally have “a duty to\nhonour our responsibilities under social practices that define groups\nand attach special responsibilities to membership,” (Dworkin\n1986, 198) provided the group's members think that their obligations\nare special, personal, and derive from a good faith interpretation of\nequal concern for the well-being of all its members. In truth, however,\nthese conditions are not a matter of the members’ actual feelings\nand thoughts—they are interpretive properties that we would do\nwell to impute to them (201). Even so, why do they ground a duty of\nobedience as opposed to a duty of respectful attention, or a duty to\napologize for cases of non-compliance? Certainly obedience is not part\nof Dworkin's paradigm virtue of “fraternity”—mutual\naid and support are the normal obligations there. Indeed, the classical\nassociative model for political authority was not fraternity, but\npaternity, against which Locke argued so decisively. This is\nnot to deny that we owe something to those decent associations of which\nwe find ourselves non-voluntary members—but we do need some\nfurther argument to determine exactly what this amounts to. \n\nA more typical non-voluntarist theory says authority may be\ninstrumentally justified as a way to help its subjects do what they\nought. \n\nRaz calls this the “normal justification thesis” (NJT).\nIt is satisfied only if the authority bases his directives on the\nreasons which apply to the subjects (the “dependence\nthesis”) and if the subjects take his directives as pre-emptive\nreasons, displacing their own judgments about what is to be done on the\nmerits (the “pre-emption thesis”). Three points need\nemphasis. First, a normal justification is not a unique justification,\nbut one typical to a variety of practical and theoretical authorities.\nAt its core idea is that justified authorities help their subjects do\nwhat they already have good reason to do; it does not apply when it is\nmore important for the subjects to decide for themselves than to decide\ncorrectly. Second, although NJT has similarities to\nrule-utilitarianism, it is not a utilitarian theory: that requires\nfurther commitments about what sort of reasons are relevant and how\nabout indirect policies may be pursued. Third, NJT does not require\nvalid authority to promote the subject's self-interest. For example, if\nthere are investments it is immoral to make (e.g., in countries that\ntolerate slavery) then a consultant's recommendations merit deference\nonly they steer one away from those investments: it is not enough (or\npermissible) for them to maximize one's financial returns. NJT is\ngoverned by whatever reasons correctly apply to the case, not\nreasons of which the agent is aware, or which serve his self-interest\nnarrowly understood. \n\nSomething like this does capture the way we justify deferring to\nexpert opinions of scientists or to the advice of doctors who know\nbetter than we do. Were we to try to second-guess them we could not\nprofit from their expertise. To accept them as authoritative therefore\nrequires deferring to their judgement, and allowing that to displace\nour own assessment of what is to be done. This is not blind\ndeference: the subject remains attentive to higher-order considerations\nthat determine whether the authority is trustworthy, acting in good\nfaith, and so on. And the deference may be limited in scope and subject\nto checks of its effectiveness over time. \n\nHow far do such considerations apply to political authority? They do\nto some extent. A legislator or administrator may know better than most\nwhat is to be done to preserve the salmon fisheries or to slow global\nwarming. But some scientists may know as well, or better, and in some\nareas there are be no criteria of relevant expertise at all. The only\nprospect of broadening NJT's reach therefore rests on its application\nto integrate the activity of many people who must cooperate but who\ndisagree on these matters and more. If authority is able to create or\nsupport valuable schemes of social cooperation, subjects may be\njustified in obeying even though that is not the scheme they would\nthemselves have chosen. It is sometimes argued that this is so in\ngeneral “co-ordination problems” and in situations in which\nindividual reasoning might be self-defeating, for instance, in\nprisoner's-dilemmas. \n\nIt is uncertain how far deference to authority is really needed\nhere. The extent to which people need authoritative guidance to secure\ncooperation varies with context. And law can solve some problems of\ncooperation simply providing information or by restructuring incentives\n(see Green 1988, 89–157). That suggests that NJT covers only a narrow\nrange of legitimate state activity. But in another way it seems too\nbroad. We do not think that political authority should be acknowledged\nwhenever the rulers can better ensure conformity to right\nreason. There are matters that are too trivial or otherwise\ninappropriate for political regulation. Perhaps some sort of threshold\ncondition must first be met, and NJT should be confined to issues of\ngeneral social importance. \n\nArguments based on necessity may be motivated by just that worry. On\nthis account, it is not enough that someone be able to help others\ntrack right reason, he must be able to do so within a certain domain.\nLocke thought the most urgent question for political philosophy was to\n“distinguish exactly the business of civil government”\n(Locke 1982, 26), to determine what things are properly Caesar's. Some\ncontemporary writers take a related view. Elizabeth Anscombe argues\nthat the domain of authority is the domain of necessary social\nfunctions. “If something is necessary, if it is, for example, a\nnecessary task in human life, then a right arises in those whose task\nit is, to have what belongs to the performance of the\ntask” (Anscombe 1978, 17). There are, then, two questions: What tasks\nare necessary? What rights are needed to perform them? \n\nAnswers to the first question range widely. George Klosko ties it to\nthe production of “presumptively beneficial public goods,”\ngoods that any one would want and which require social co-operation to\nproduce (Klosko 1992). Others are more extravagant. Finnis thinks law\nmust provide a comprehensive framework for realizing a list of\nsupposedly self-evident values including life, knowledge, play and\nreligion (Finnis 1979, 81–97, 154–56). An influential intermediate answer\nties political authority to the realm of justice and grounds obedience\nin a natural duty: “This duty requires us to support and comply\nwith just institutions that exist and apply to us. It also constrains\nus to further just arrangements not yet established, at least when this\ncan be done without too much cost to ourselves.” (Rawls 1971,\n115) \n\nThe basis of Rawls's theory in necessity becomes evident if we\nexplore what it might be for a just institution to “apply to\nus.” A.J. Simmons persuasively argues that an Institute for the\nAdvancement of Philosophers cannot benefit us, however justly, and then\ndemand that we pay its dues (Simmons 1979, 148). He proposes therefore\nthat a normatively relevant sense of application requires that one\naccept the benefits—but that is to transform a natural\nduty account into a weakly voluntarist one like fairness. (See below,\n§ 5.3.) Jeremy Waldron diagnoses the force of such counterexamples\nas deriving from the fact that, although operating justly, the\nInstitute is not something whose activities are required by\njustice: they are optional, not necessary (Waldron 1993). This\nseems correct; but if we then restrict the domain of authority to\nnecessity we will again leave many legal obligations behind. Many of\nthe activities of a legitimate government are optional. It must save us\nfrom the state of nature, but law's ambitions are more expansive than\nthat. It also does things that are permissible but not necessary:\nenacts residential zoning, declares official languages, establishes\nnational holidays, supports education and the arts, and creates honors.\nAnd in the service of what is mandated by necessity, law draws lines\nand sets standards that are themselves merely permissible—an\nage of consent, an acceptable level of risk-imposition, formalities for\nwills and marriages, and so on—what Aquinas called\n“determinations” of just requirements. The content of all\nthis valuable and permissible state action is underdetermined by the\ntheory of legitimacy and is grounded in considerations other than\nnecessity. So necessitarian arguments leave unsupported \nsome—possibly a lot—of valuable state action. Moreover, it is\nunclear what is necessary for law to fulfil its socially\nnecessary functions. Anscombe refers to the right to have what is\nnecessary for the role, but what is that? Hume thought it obvious that\npolitical society could not exist without “exact obedience of the\nmagistrate” but this is surely empiricism without the facts.\nEveryone knows that a legal system can, and does, tolerate a certain\namount of harmless disobedience and that this in no way hampers its\ncapacity to function. \n\n“The Right of all Sovereigns,” says Hobbes in\nLeviathan (chap. 42) “is derived originally from the\nconsent of everyone of those that are to be governed.” In the\nSecond Treatise (§ 95) Locke says: “Men being\n… by nature all free, equal, and independent, no one can be put\nout of this estate and subjected to the political power of another\nwithout his own consent.” The ideological influence of such\ntheories in the struggles for representative government and\ndecolonisation was immense. Few now deny, in the words of the American\nDeclaration of Independence, that all governments “deriv[e] their\njust powers from the consent of the governed.” It is perhaps not\ntoo much to say that consent has become the normal justification for\npolitical authority. \n\nBut whose consent, and to what? Not the consent of our ancestors,\nfor such an “original” contract, as it was called in the\nseventeenth century, can have no authority over those who did not agree\nto it. A voluntarist theory requires the actual consent of each\nsubject. But this cannot mean consent to every law or application\nthereof. The evident absurdity of that idea leads Finnis to declare\nconsent “intrinsically implausible”: “the need for\nauthority is, precisely, to substitute for unanimity in determining the\nsolution of practical co-ordination problems which involve or concern\neveryone in the community” (Finnis 1979, 248). Consent theorists,\nhowever, have not generally proposed the principle as a solution to\n“practical co-ordination problems.” Unanimous consent would\nbe a very bad decision rule: the transaction costs would be\nenormous and hold-outs could block many desirable policies. Consent is\nmore commonly proposed as a part of the constitution rule that\nsets up the political community in the first place. Consent theorists\nreject, therefore, Kant's idea in the Metaphysics of Morals\n(§ 44) that the mere capacity of A to violently affect\nB's interests is sufficient licence for anyone to subject them\nboth to a regime of positive law. For consent theorists, an\nA-B interaction does not become a candidate for\nauthoritative regulation until A and B agree to unite\nunder one jurisdiction. We cannot ask which or what sort of authority\nis justified over both the Kurds and the Shiites in Iraq until we\nanswer why there should be one at all. Beyond this foundational role,\nhowever, consent theorists take different views of whether it has any\nfurther significance in policy. Locke thinks it is then displaced by\nmajority rule by delegates as the natural procedure for most decisions;\nfor Rousseau, this is but another form of slavery. \n\nEven in its confined role, however, consent has attracted powerful\ncriticism. (For a good survey see Simmons 1979, 57–100; for a qualified\ndefence see Beran 1987.) These focus on the questions of whether it is in\nfact given and, if given, whether it would bind. Consent is not mere\nconsensus or approval; it is a performative commitment that undertakes\nan obligation through the very act of consenting. Like other promises\nand oaths, however, there are limits to its validity. We need to ensure\nthat consent is not defeated by mistake, coercion or duress. It must\nalso respect substantive limits on its validity. Locke argues that one\ncannot consent to be killed, and thus not to slavery, and thus not to\nanything tantamount to slavery, including absolute government. One can\nimagine a similar argument to the conclusion that political consent\nmust be revocable. But as we build in all these validity conditions the\ncommitment itself seems to be doing less and less work. Pitkin thinks\nthat in Locke's version it becomes “essentially\nirrelevant” (Pitkin 1965, 57). Consent is saved from irrelevance only\nif we can explain why we also value a power to bind ourselves\nto obey. David Hume could conceive no reason at all: promise-keeping is\nan “artificial virtue” serving the public good, just like\nobedience to law. So long as law is tolerably legitimate—and\nHume is prepared to give it a very wide berth—a promise to obey\nis redundant, for any plausible answer to the question why we are bound\nby the promise would “immediately, without any circuit, have\naccounted for our obligation to allegiance;” “being of like\nforce and authority, we gain nothing by resolving the one into the\nother” (Hume 1985, 481). A consent theory need not, however,\n“resolve” allegiance into a promise—there may also\nbe non-promissory conditions on obedience—but it must explain\nwhy it should be conditional on it. Three sorts of arguments have been\npopular. First, there are instrumental reasons for wanting deliberate\ncontrol over the liability to legal duties. In political authority,\nwhere the stakes are as high as they come, the power to give and\nwithhold consent serves an ultimate protective function beyond what we\ncould expect from the fallible institutions of limited government.\nSecond, consent enables people to establish political allegiances by\ncreating new political societies or joining existing ones without\nawaiting the gradual emergence of bonds of community and reciprocity;\nconsent is an immediate passport to “perfect membership” in\na commonwealth. (Locke: § 119). Third, though consent is defined\nby its performative character, ancillary non-performative features\nnaturally accompany it: consent also expresses the acceptability, or at\nleast tolerability, of the government. This may mark consented-to\nrulers as salient from among a number of possible contenders, and it\nmay signal that they stand a good chance of being effective, which is\nitself a necessary condition for the justification of any political\nauthority. \n\nIt is open to doubt how persuasive such considerations are. But\nmatters are even worse, for it is in any case clear that many people\nhave done nothing that counts as giving such consent. Even freely given\noaths of office and naturalization do not usually amount to a general\ncommitment to obey the law (Greenawalt 1987). Other acts are even less\nplausibly so interpreted. Plato's Crito introduces the idea\nthat continued residence counts as some kind of tacit consent to obey,\nand Locke extends that to include any enjoyment of the benefits of\ngovernment—“whether it be barely travelling freely on the\nhighway” (§ 199). Whatever the moral relevance of these\nfacts, they do not count as consent, for people do these things without\nimagining they will create obligations, and they do them in\ncircumstances in which they have no feasible alternative. Other\nnon-promissory actions, for example voting or participating in\npolitics, fare no better: many do not vote, and few who do regard it as\nundertaking any duties at all. Perhaps we can say that if\npeople consent, and if the relevant legitimacy conditions are\nfulfilled, then they will have a duty to obey the law. That is\nobviously a far cry from establishing law's claims. \n\nConsent supposes that obligations of obedience must be somehow\nundertaken by acts the point of which is to assume an obligation. There\nare weaker forms of voluntarism. Some relationships that one may freely\nenter (or at least exit) are marked by obligations. In essence, this is\na voluntarist version of the theory of constitutive obligations\nconsidered above in Section 4.1, and it offers the most plausible\ninterpretation of arguments from gratitude (Walker 1988; Klosko 1989) or\ncommunity. \n\nOn such views we are bound to obey because that is an appropriate\nexpression of emotions we have good reason to feel: gratitude to the\nlaw for all that it gives us, respect for its good-faith efforts to\nguide us, or a sense of belonging to the community. In the last case,\nthe relationship cannot merely be that of being a subject of the law;\nit must be something like membership in the community whose law it is\n(Raz 1979, 250–61). Friendship provides an analogy. People choose their\nfriends, but not in order to have obligations to them. A flourishing\nfriendship does, however, bring obligations in train. In addition to\nthe familiar reasons for fulfilling its duties of support, honesty,\nreciprocity etc., it is plausible to suppose that doing so also\nexpresses and is known to express loyalty to one's friends, and that\nthat gives additional support to the duties. Similarly, suggests Raz,\n“A person identifying himself with his society, feeling that it\nis his and that he belongs to it, is loyal to his society. His loyalty\nmay express itself, among other ways, in respect for the law of the\ncommunity” (1979, 259). This is bound to be a somewhat loose \nfit—the institutional and bureaucratic structure of law means that\nit will generally be an imperfect expression of the society it\nregulates. And, as Raz notes, expressive arguments apply only to those\nwho actually stand in this special relation; they do not show that it\nis obligatory to do so, nor that it is obligatory to express one's\nloyalty in this way rather than some other. Moreover, it is unclear why\nwe should even think that obedience is a fitting expression of this\nsort of relationship in the first place. Is this a well-entrenched\nconvention? Is it somehow normatively appropriate? Loyalty to one's\nfriends is not normally shown in obeying them. Why should\nloyalty to the community be any different? \n\nPerhaps the most influential voluntarist argument grounds political\nobligation in neither performative nor expressive acts, but in a\nbare willingness to benefit from a system of mutual restraint. This is\nthe territory of fairness, or fair play, as articulated by Hart (1955)\nand elaborated by Rawls (1964). The core idea is that those who accept\nthe benefits of fair scheme of cooperation have a duty to do their\nallotted part under that scheme: if others obey the law to our benefit,\nwe owe them a duty not to take a free-ride on their compliance. \n\nThe idea that law's benefits must be accepted may not be a\nnecessary condition for the validity of all obligations of fair play\n(Arneson 1982; Klosko 1992), but it is essential for any that aspire to be\nconsistent with political voluntarism. If a scheme of cooperation\nsimply thrusts benefits on people as the unavoidable fall-out of the\ncooperative activity of others—even very valuable \nbenefits—any duty of compliance would have to be justified by one of the\nnon-voluntary principles considered above. Adding the acceptance\ncondition does not of course reduce fairness to consent: those\nwho jump subway turnstiles do not mean to assume an obligation to pay\nthe fare. But it does renders fairness vulnerable to the very same\nobjection: not enough people perform the relevant action. The\ncentral benefits of an effective legal system, including security and\norder, are all the sort of non-excludable public goods that Simmons\n(1979, 138–39) calls “open benefits.” They can be avoided\nonly at great cost, and in many cases not at all. What's more, not all\ncases of disobedience can plausibly be represented as free-riding, and\nobligations of fairness track the jurisdiction of the law only in a\nrough-and-ready way. Fairness will give rise to obligations whenever\nthere is a beneficial practice of mutual constraint and accepted\nbenefit—it matters not whether this is sustained by a law\nclaiming jurisdiction over the subjects. \n\nAs the above survey suggests, there are plausible objections to each\nof the dominant justifications for the duty to obey the law. (For\nhelpful assessments of other theories, see also Wasserstrom 1963; Smith 1973; and\nSimmons 1979.) Each leaves significant gaps in the authority of law.\nThis is not an impossibility proof—only anarchists like Wolff\nthink that justified political authority is impossible. But neither is\nit just the familiar problem that philosophical theories provide only a\nrough fit to our casuistic judgements. It is that the typical\njustifications for authority are all sensitive to context in a way that\nthe claims of law are not. To put it another way, law itself purports\nto determine how far and in what contexts its authority binds. \n\nThe resulting scepticism about the obligation to obey has given rise\nto a debate about its significance (Senor 1987; Gans 1992, 90). As in other areas\nof philosophy, some treat sceptical conclusions as a reductio\nagainst whatever premises seem to support them; others are inclined to\nfollow the arguments where they lead. In assessing the significance of\nscepticism, one needs to bear in mind several points:","contact.mail":"leslie.green@law.ox.ac.uk","contact.domain":"law.ox.ac.uk"}]
