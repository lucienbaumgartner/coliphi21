During this time Plato and Aristotle were regarded as\nphilosophical authorities and their works were subject to intense\nstudy. This entry offers a concise account of how the revival of\ninterest in the philosophy of Aristotle that took place toward the\nend of the Hellenistic period eventually developed into a new literary\nproduction: the philosophical commentary. It also follows the\ncommentary tradition into Late Antiquity in order to account for the\nvitality and richness of this tradition. Special emphasis is given to\nthe ancient study of the Categories because this short but\ndifficult treatise played a central role in the Post-Hellenistic\nreturn to Aristotle. The reader should keep in mind that the study of\nAristotle in the form of the commentary did not mean the cessation of\ngenuine philosophical thought. Quite the contrary: philosophers\ncustomarily used the commentary format not only to expound the works\nof Aristotle, but also as a vehicle for original philosophical\ntheorizing. One consequence of this approach was that, at least at the\nbeginning, the return to Aristotle did not involve the acceptance of\nany definite set of doctrines. More directly (and more boldly), there\nwas no definite set of doctrines that a Peripatetic philosopher in the\n1st century BCE was expected to accept. At the time\nAristotle was considered an authority not because he was above\ncriticism, but because he deserved to be studied carefully.\n\nThe primary purpose of a commentary is to explain a text. Typically,\nthe text is divided into lemmata. A lemma is what is quoted from\na text in order to explain and interpret it. Some times the text is\nquoted in its entirety. Other times only its beginning is quoted. The\nlemma is always followed by an analysis of the text. Commentaries were\nnot written exclusively on philosophical works. Quite the opposite: any poetical or\nscientific work that came to be regarded as authoritative could be\ncommented upon. For example, the tradition of writing commentaries on\nthe Hippocratic corpus started very early. Although most of this\ntradition is lost, the commentaries that Galen wrote on the\nHippocratic corpus have come down to us. Galen was a doctor who lived\nand wrote in the second half of the 2nd century\nCE. Interestingly enough, his exegetical activity was not confined to\nHippocrates. Galen wrote on several of Aristotle’s works,\nspecifically on the De Interpretatione, the Prior\nand Posterior Analytics, and the Categories (Galen,\nOn my Own Books, XIX 47). In all probability, these\ncommentaries were not intended for publication but only for the use of\na small group of friends and students. Here is what Galen says about\nhis commentary on the Categories: \nGalen makes clear that he regards the commentator as a teacher, an\nexpositor with a specific audience of students in mind. Moreover, as\nGalen presents the matter, the commentary was a teaching tool\naddressed to students with specific levels of knowledge. The students\nwho were expected to read Galen on the Categories were not\nabsolute beginners.  They were students who either had previously\nbenefited from the study of this treatise with a teacher or had become\nacquainted with the\nCategories through some more elementary commentaries. Galen\nrefers to the commentaries written by Adrastus and Aspasius. By so\ndoing, he gives us an idea of the profusion of commentaries that were\nwritten on the Categories. These commentaries were written\none after the other as part of an already consolidated exegetical\npractice. Unfortunately, most of these commentaries have not reached\nus. We no longer have the commentaries that Adrastus and Aspasius\nwrote on the Categories, nor do we have the commentary that\nGalen wrote on the same treatise. This frustrating (at least for us)\nfact is ultimately due to the very nature of this literary production.\nEach generation of commentators read and interpreted Aristotle in the\nlight of their own theoretical preoccupations and proclivities, only\nto be replaced by the next generation of commentators. One remarkable\nexception is Alexander of Aphrodisias, a younger contemporary of\nGalen. His commentaries survive because they were adopted as exemplary\nmodels by later commentators. But not all of them have come down to\nus. For example, Alexander wrote a commentary on the\nCategories (Simplicius, In Cat. 1.16). This\ncommentary is not extant. It suffered the same fate as those written\nby Adrastus, Aspasius, Galen, and others. It survives only in\nfragmentary form, incorporated in the commentaries that a later\ngeneration of interpreters wrote on the Categories.  \nThe critical engagement with Aristotle that began toward the end of\nthe Hellenistic age and continued throughout the centuries that\nfollowed was directed to works such as the Categories, which\nhad been largely ignored in the preceding centuries. This engagement\npresupposes the availability of Aristotle’s writings in a form\nthat suited the interests and needs of the time. Although the\ninformation in our possession is slim, it strongly suggests that an\nintense editorial activity took place in the 1st century\nBCE. Apellicon of Teos, a bibliophile rather than a philosopher, seems\nto have produced copies of Aristotle’s works in the 90s (Strabo,\nGeo. XIII I 54); Tyrannion of Amisus, a grammarian and\nenthusiast of Aristotle (philaristotelês), who had\naccess to Apellicon’s books, may have done the same in the 60s\n(but our sources do not say that he edited the works of Aristotle;\nthey only say that he “put in order the books of\nAristotle”; Strabo, Geo. XIII I 54; Plutarch,\nSulla 26 468 B-C). According to the tradition, these\neditorial labors were surpassed by that of Andronicus of Rhodes, who\nis credited with the production of the first reliable edition of\nAristotle; an edition that exercised an enormous influence on the\npost-Hellenistic return to Aristotle. (More information on this\nputative edition is available in \na supplementary document.) In reality, Andronicus could not be\nentirely responsible for the revival of interest in the philosophy of\nAristotle. This revival was, at least in part, independent of him.\nMoreover, a close study of the fortune that the Categories\nenjoyed in this context suggests that the return to Aristotle took\ndifferent forms and involved a great variety of exegetical positions\nnot necessarily related to one another. Finally, the return to\nAristotle did not necessarily involve either the acceptance of the\nviews stated by Aristotle or codification in the form of the\ncommentary. In short, there was no orthodoxy in the Aristotelian\ntradition at this early stage (pace Moraux 1973, pages\nXII–XX, especially XVI–XVII). \nWe have the names of five ancient interpreters (palaioi\nexêgêtai) of the Categories whose activity\nis placed in the 1st century BCE: Andronicus, Boethus,\nAthenodorus, Ariston, and Eudorus (Simplicius, In Cat.\n159.32–33). It is likely that, of these five philosophers, only\nBoethus of Sidon wrote a commentary on the Categories.\nBoethus’ activity can be dated in the second half of the\n1st century BCE. Simplicius contrasts his\n“word-by-word exegesis” to that of Andronicus, who is said\n“to have paraphrased the Categories” (Simplicius,\nIn Cat. 29.28–30.5). We cannot exclude that Simplicius\nprojected his own literary conventions onto Andronicus and Boethus,\nand that by his own standards Boethus and Andronicus were\nengaged in two different exegetical exercises. On the one hand, there\nis some clear evidence that Andronicus did rephrase and clarify\nAristotle’s text in order to extract Aristotle’s\nintentions. On the other hand, there is no reason to think that\nAndronicus wrote in the style that will later be codified as\nparaphrase. Themistius was the champion of this particular form of\nexegesis in antiquity. Interestingly enough, Themistius does not give\nus names of predecessors. His silence is open to different\ninterpretations: either Themistius did not know of Andronicus’\nwork on the Categories or this work was not written in the\nstyle of a paraphrase. Fortunately, it is not essential for us to\nestablish whether or not Andronicus was the first paraphraser of\nAristotle. What matters is that his style of exegesis was perceived as\ndifferent from that of Boethus. Unlike Andronicus, Boethus was engaged\nin an in-depth examination of whole book of the Categories in\nthe form of a word-by-word commentary. Boethus was highly regarded in\nantiquity. Simplicius refers to him as “the amazing\nBoethus” (In Cat. 1.18), “the noble\nBoethus” (In Cat. 379.32), and prizes “the\nsharpness of his mind” (In Cat. 1.23 and 434.18).\nExcept for a few testimonies, his commentary has not survived. From\nthese few testimonies, however, it is clear that Boethus concerned\nhimself with the difficulties that the Stoics raised against\nAristotle’s Categories. The Stoics attacked the\nCategories on the assumption that this treatise is on\nlanguage and about linguistic expressions. They argued that as a\ntreatise on language and about linguistic expressions the\nCategories was incomplete. Boethus resisted this reading of\nthe Categories and anticipated a line of interpretation that\nwas then followed, among others, by Porphyry. \nBoethus’ defense of the Categories documents that this\ntreatise was intensely read and studied, and not only among\nphilosophers friendly to Aristotle. The Stoic philosopher Athenodorus\nis credited with a book (Simplicius, In Cat. 86.22) or books\n(Porphyry, In Cat. 62.25–26) significantly entitled\nAgainst Aristotle’s Categories. We know very little\nabout Athenodorus. If he is the same person as Athenodorus of\nTarsus, who was a friend and adviser of the Emperor Augustus and was\nappointed by him as governor of Taurus, then Athenodorus was active in\nthe second half of the 1st century BCE. There is no\ncompelling reason to think that his critique of the\nCategories was written in the form of a commentary.\nAthenodorus could have been content with offering a series of\nobjections and difficulties, just as the Platonist Lucius and\nNicostratus would do more than a hundred years later (Simplicius,\nIn Cat 1.18–20: “Others have chosen simply to\npresent a series of difficulties (aporiai) arising from the\ntext, which is what has been done by Lucius, and after him by\nNicostratus, who took over for himself the job of Lucius”). \nThe temptation to credit all the ancient interpreters of the\nCategories with a commentary must be resisted also in the\ncase of Eudorus of Alexandria. It is generally assumed that Eudorus\nflourished in the middle of the first century BCE. Simplicius is not\ncontent to enumerate Eudorus among the ancient interpreters of the\nCategories. He preserves nine testimonies in which Eudorus\ntook issue with Aristotle. But no inference about the form of his\nliterary production is possible. The only safe inference is that the\nstudy of the Categories was not confined to the school of\nAristotle. In fact, Eudorus was not a Peripatetic philosopher.\nSimplicius refers to him as the “Academic Eudorus” (In\nCat. 187.10). \nThe last name on list of the ancient interpreters of the\nCategories is that of Ariston of Alexandria. From Cicero\n(Lucullus §§ 11–12), we learn that Ariston was\namong the learned men who attended the conversations that took place\nin Alexandria in 87 BCE between Heraclitus of Tyrus, a former student\nof Clitomachus and Philo of Larissa, and Antiochus of Ascalon. Cicero\ndepicts Ariston as a pupil of Antiochus. That Ariston was a pupil of\nAntiochus is confirmed by the Index Academicorum, a history\nof the Academy written by Philodemus in the 1st century\nBCE. There, we are told that Antiochus “took over <the\nAcademy>” (XXXIV 34 Dorandi). A list of his students is also given.\nThe list includes the names of Aristus, Antiochus’ brother;\nAriston and Dio of Alexandria; and Cratippus of Pergamum (XXXV\n1–6 Dorandi). What immediately follows is extremely interesting:\n“Ariston of Alexandria and Cratippus of Pegamum deserted the\nAcademy and turned Peripatetic” (XXXV 10–16 Dorandi). We are not\ntold the reasons for their defection to Peripatetic philosophy. In the\ncase of Ariston it is also difficult to see what this defection really\ninvolved. From the information in our possession we can only say that\nhe wrote about the Categories. But there is no evidence that\nAriston wrote in the form of a commentary. His case is significantly\ndifferent from that of Andronicus and Boethus. Andronicus and Boethus\nmade an attempt to organise, clarify, and indeed defend, the\nphilosophy of Aristotle. This does not seem to apply to Ariston. His\nname is never related to those of Andronicus and Boethus. In addition,\nthere is no evidence that Ariston was aware of the existence of\nAndronicus and Boethus, or that he was influenced by their works. That\nthe edition of Andronicus played a role in the conversion of Ariston\nto the philosophy of Aristotle is merely a conjecture. \nThe revival of interest in the philosophy of Aristotle outlived the\n1st century BCE. The exegetical activity on the works of\nAristotle continued to flourish in the 1st and\n2nd century CE. New layers of interpretation were added in\nthese two centuries. They greatly contributed to the formation of the\nexegetical tradition that found its culmination in the commentaries of\nAlexander of Aphrodisias. \nAlexander of Aegae wrote about the Categories (Simplicius,\nIn Cat. 10.20; 13.16) and the De caelo (Simplicius,\nIn DC 430.29–32). Since he is said to have been teacher\nof the Emperor Nero, his exegetical activity can be dated in the first\nhalf of the 1st century CE. Nothing can be said about the\nform of his literary production. This is also the case of two other\ninterpreters of the Categories: Sotion and Achaius\n(Simplicius, In Cat. 159.23). Although their exegetical\nactivity is much more difficult to date, there is one line of argument\nthat places it in the 1st century CE. The information at\nour disposal is frustratingly meagre, but it is hard to escape the\nconclusion that the Categories continued to be at the centre\nof the exegetical activity on the philosophy of Aristotle. The\nsituation did not change in the first half of the 2nd\ncentury CE. From Galen we learn that Adrastus of Aphrodisias and\nAspasius wrote elementary commentaries on the Categories.\nFrom the way Galen refers to these commentaries, they must have been\neasily available and routinely used to introduce students to the\nCategories. Adrastus and Aspasius established themselves as\nrespected interpreters of Aristotle. We know that their commentaries\nwere still used about one hundred years later by the great Plotinus\n(Porphyry, Life of Plotinus. 14.12–14). Aspasius did not\nconfine his exegetical activity to the Categories. He wrote\ncommentaries on the De Interpretatione, the Physics,\nand the Metaphysics. These commentaries were used and quoted\nby later generations of commentators. The reputation that Aspasius\nenjoyed in antiquity explains why his commentary on Aristotle’s\nEthics has survived. This commentary is the earliest\nsurviving commentary on an Aristotelian text. \nOne significant impact on the way the practice of philosophy developed\ntoward the end of the 2nd century CE was the intervention\nof the imperial power in matters of education. This intervention seems\nto go as far back as the Emperor Antoninus Pius, who is said to have\nestablished public chairs of rhetoric and philosophy in the provinces. \nBut it was Marcus Aurelius who\nfirst established Imperial chairs of philosophy in Athens in 176 CE.\nFrom our ancient sources we are told that those chairs were in\nPlatonic, Stoic, Peripatetic and Epicurean philosophy. In all\nprobability, the first holder of the chair in Aristotelian philosophy\nwas Alexander of Damascus, an older contemporary of Galen described by\nhim as “knowledgeable about the doctrines of Plato but more\ninclined to those of Aristotle” (Galen, De praenotione\nXIV 627–628 Kühn). The holder of the Imperial chairs was a\npublic teacher and received an annual salary. His teaching consisted\nin lecturing on the texts of the founder of the school. Alexander of\nAphrodisias was one of these teachers publicly appointed to a chair of\nAristotelian philosophy. Alexander refers to himself as a teacher,\ndidaskalos (De fato 164.15). As a teacher of\nAristotelian philosophy, Alexander was concerned not only with\nexplicating this philosophy but also with defending it in the context\nof the debates between philosophical schools. His attitude towards\nAristotle is best expressed at the very beginning of his De\nanima. This treatise is not a commentary on Aristotle’s\nDe anima but an investigation of the soul based on the\nprinciples established in Aristotle’s De anima. The\ntask that here Alexander sets for himself is that of clarifying and\npromoting the views of Aristotle: \nAlexander wrote commentaries on most of Aristotle’s treatises.\nHis commentaries on the Prior Analytics (book 1), the\nTopics, the Meteorology, and On Sense\nPerception have survived. Of the commentary on the\nMetaphysics that is transmitted under his name, only the\nfirst five books are regarded as genuine. The commentary on the\nSophistical Refutations, traditionally attributed to\nAlexander, is spurious. Although Alexander is best known for his\ncommentaries on Aristotle, his exegetical activity extended to include\nshort discussions on specific points of interpretation within\nAristotelian philosophy. These discussions are collected in four books\nof Problems and Solutions and in a further book traditionally\nknown as Mantissa.\nThese collections offer an eloquent illustration of the extraordinary\nvariety of exegetical methods deployed in the exposition of\nAristotle’s philosophy. Up to a point, the deployment of such a\nvariety of exegetical methods can be explained with reference to the\npedagogic function of these writings, which were used as teaching\ntools in the instruction of students with different levels of\nknowledge of Aristotle’s philosophy.  \nAlexander’s exegetical activity ultimately consisted in an\neffort of systematization combined with an attempt to extract what he\nregarded as the genuine thought of Aristotle. It was this loyalty to\nthe philosophy of the master coupled with the finesse of his\ninterpretation that gained Alexander the reputation of “the most\nauthentic interpreter of Aristotle” (Simplicius, In\nPhys. 80.16). His commentaries set standards of interpretations\nthat remained largely unsurpassed in antiquity. But it is important to\nrealize that his extraordinary accomplishment was the culmination of\nthe exegetical tradition that had started in the 1st\ncentury BCE. Moreover, Alexander was not the first but rather the last\nauthentic interpreter of Aristotle. Although subsequent generations of\ncommentators were profoundly influenced by Alexander, they were\nmotivated by a very different exegetical ideal. Their primary aim was\nno longer to recover and preserve Aristotle’s thought for its\nown sake, but for the sake of finding agreement between Aristotle and\nPlato and presenting them as part of one and the same philosophical\noutlook. (For further information on Alexander as a commentator and a\nphilosopher, see Sections 2 and 3 of the entry on\n Alexander of Aphrodisias.)\n  \nThe study of Aristotle through close textual reading of his works\ncontinued, if not increased, in Late Antiquity. So did the supply of\ncommentaries on all his major works. Unlike Alexander of Aphrodisias,\nhowever, most of these commentators regarded themselves as Platonists.\nFor them, Plato’s philosophy was superior to all the systems of\nthought that came later. In addition, they believed that all these\nlater systems started out as developments of Plato’s philosophy.\nAristotle was no exception to the rule. These commentators viewed\nAristotle as a true descendant of Plato. This explains why by\nreverting to Plato they did not mean to reject Aristotle’s\nphilosophy. On the contrary, they were convinced that this philosophy\ncould be integrated into a Platonic framework. The Platonism of Late\nAntiquity was so comprehensive as a system of thought that it could\nharbor Aristotle’s philosophy. In this frame of mind, a major\nexegetical concern became that of finding substantial agreement\nbetween Plato and Aristotle. For most of these commentators, the\ndisagreement on specific issues between Aristotle and Plato did not\npreclude harmony between the two philosophers on a deeper level. \nIn reality, the conciliation of Plato and Aristotle attempted by these\ncommentators consisted in an appropriation of Aristotle’s works\nas a pre-requisite for the study of Plato’s philosophy. Among\nthese works, the Categories continued to enjoy a special\nstatus. This treatise was considered an elementary introduction to the\nwhole of philosophy and as such it was used to teach beginners with\nlittle or no knowledge of philosophy (Porphyry, In Cat. 56.\n28–29). For this reason the exegetical activity on this short\nbut difficult treatise never stopped but in fact increased in Late\nAntiquity. The key figure for the reception of the Categories\nduring this period was undoubtedly Porphyry (c. 234–305\nCE). The latter wrote a commentary in seven books addressed to a\nstudent named Gedalius. In this commentary, Porphyry offered a\ncomplete interpretation of the Categories, including a\nresolution of all previous aporiai (Simplicius, In\nCat. 2. 6–9). He also dealt with the traditional criticism\nof the Categories, including a comprehensive discussion of\nthe objections leveled by the earlier interpreters of the\nCategories (e.g., the Stoic Athenodorus and Cornutus, and the\nPlatonic Lucius and Nicostratus). His defense of the\nCategories relied, and indeed expanded, on the Peripatetic\ntradition (e.g., Boethus of Sidon, Alexander of Aphrodisias). An\nexcerpt from this commentary has been recently discovered in what is\nknown as the Archimedes Palimpsest (See R. Chiaradonna, M. Rashed, and D.\nSedley 2013). Porphyry\nwrote another commentary on the Categories. This second\ncommentary has reached us. The results achieved in the more\ncomprehensive commentary are here abbreviated, simplified, and made\naccessible in the form of a dialogue between a teacher and a pupil.\nThe existence of two commentaries written in a different format on the\nvery same treatise by the same author has to be understood in the\nlight of the fact that these commentaries were teaching tools and were\nused to teach students with different skills and different levels of\nfamiliarity with the Categories. Finally, Porphyry is the\nauthor of the Isagoge (literally,\n“Introduction”). This short book is an\nintroduction to Aristotle’s theory of predication. It is\naddressed to absolute beginners in philosophy whose reading curriculum\nthen continued with Aristotle’s logic, beginning with the\nCategories. \nThe commentary addressed to Gedalius became an instant success and an\nexample to imitate. Iamblichus (c. 242–325 CE) is known\nto have written a commentary on the Categories that closely\nfollowed this commentary, abbreviating the argument and making the\noverall interpretation clearer. He is also known to have amplified the\nPorphyrian interpretation with the help of the book that the\nPythagorean Archytas wrote on the doctrine of the categories\n(Simplicius, In Cat. 2.9–14). The writing in question\nis a late forgery intended to claim Aristotle’s doctrine of the\nten categories for the Pythagorean school. Iamblichus considered this\nforgery an authentic anticipation of Aristotle’s\nCategories and a vindication of his vision of philosophy as a\nsingle tradition of wisdom, starting with Pythagoras and continuing\nwith Plato and Aristotle. Iamblichus is reported to have made use of\nthe considerations of Archytas when it was appropriate in the attempt\nto demonstrate the overall agreement between Aristotle and the\nPythagorean doctrine. \nIamblichus’ commentary is lost, but we can form an idea of the\ncontribution that this commentary made to the ancient debate on the\nCategories thanks to Dexippus. Nothing is known about\nDexippus besides the fact that he was a pupil of Iamblichus. His\nsurviving commentary provides a concise and clear presentation of the\nsolutions offered to the aporiai leveled against\nAristotle’s Categories. Dexippus opted for the\nquestion-and-answer format, which better suited his purpose to provide\na brief and relatively simple summary of the exegetical results\nachieved by his predecessors, especially Porphyry and Iamblichus.\nDexippus was not an original thinker. According to Simplicius, he\nadded virtually nothing to the considerations of Porphyry and\nIamblichus (Simplicius, In Cat. 2. 29–30). \nAfter having mastered the Categories, the student of\nphilosophy was expected to read the rest of the Aristotelian corpus\nbefore turning to Plato’s dialogues. Syrianus, the teacher of\nProclus (c. 410–485 CE), exposed his students to both\nPlato and Aristotle, starting with Aristotle. Proclus arrived in\nAthens around 430, at a time when Plutarch, the previous head of the\nschool, was an old man and Syrianus had already taken over. As a young\nand gifted student, Proclus read Aristotle’s De anima\nand Plato’s Phaedo with Plutarch. But when Plutarch\ndied, Syrianus became responsible for his philosophical education.\nUnder the direction of Syrianus, Proclus mastered in less than two\nyears the entire Aristotelian corpus. He studied the logical, ethical,\npolitical, physical works and finished up with theology (Marinus,\nLife of Proclus, chapters 12 and 13). The sequence\nlogic-ethics-politics-physics-theology reflected not only a certain\norganization of the teaching but also a particular conception of\nphilosophy. To begin with, the first place assigned to\nAristotle’s logical writings was not neutral with respect to a\ncertain view of the nature of logic. By this time logic was regarded\nas a tool for philosophy. This conception of logic and its relation to\nthe rest of philosophy is reflected in the collective title\nOrganon that we still use to refer to Aristotle’s\nlogical writings. Moreover, the non-theological writings were\npreliminary to the study of theology as it is contained in the\nMetaphysics. This treatise was the last of Aristotle’s\nworks to be studied. The conception of God as an intellect and a\nliving being enjoying the state of perfect actuality was designed by\nSyrianus as the culmination of his course on Aristotle’s\nphilosophy. Once Proclus had mastered the Metaphysics and\nlearned about the Aristotelian conception of the divine, Syrianus\ndirected him to Plato, whose dialogues were also read in a definite\nsequence, culminating with the Timaeus and the\nParmenides. \nThis attitude toward the philosophy of Aristotle and Plato was passed\nfrom Syrianus to Proclus, and from Proclus to Ammonius (c.\n440–520 CE). The commentaries of Ammonius on the\nCategories, the De Interpretatione, the Prior\nAnalytics, and Porphyry’s Isagoge have come down\nto us. The last is the earliest extant commentary on the\nIsagoge. By this time the Isagoge had already\nestablished itself as part of the reading curriculum of philosophy,\nwhich continued with the Categories, the De\nInterpretatione and the Prior Analytics. Note, however,\nthat Ammonius did not write his commentaries on the\nCategories, the Prior Analytics, and perhaps the\nIsagoge. They were produced by pupils who attended his\nlectures on Aristotle. (For further information and discussion of his\ncommentaries, see Section 1.2 of the entry on\n Ammonius.)\n Other commentaries originated in the lecture room as a transcription\nof the oral exposition delivered by the teacher. The commentaries on\nthe Categories based on the lectures offered by Olympiodorus\n(c. 495–565 CE) and his pupil Elias (David) have\nreached us. Philoponus (c. 490–570 CE) edited his own\nlectures on the Categories. However, the most influential of\nthese later commentaries was the one that Simplicius wrote after 529\nCE. Simplicius was a man of vast learning and extraordinary synthetic\npowers. He was also acutely aware of writing at the end of a long and\nvenerable exegetical tradition. He consciously tried to assimilate and\nblend together the various strands of this tradition. By so doing he\nleft us the most comprehensive and informative survey of the reception\nof the Categories in antiquity. At first sight Simplicius may\nlook like a modern scholar. His commentary shows the great care and\nprecision of a thoughtful and dedicated interpreter who is explicating\nthe Categories through a close reading of the text. Yet there\nis one important difference that must not be overlooked. Simplicius\nwas a Platonist and his exegetical activity was intended to show that\nPlato and Aristotle were in substantial agreement. Simplicius is\nadamantly clear on his own exegetical ideal: \nThe commentary tradition that found its culmination in Simplicius\nconsisted in a sincere attempt to arrive at a better understanding of\nthe Categories. By reading Simplicius’ commentary one\nstill gets a sense of the extraordinary ingenuity that this tradition\nemployed in explicating this short yet elusive treatise. But\none also gets the impression that this tradition had no privileged\naccess to this text. Quite the contrary: from the beginning of the\nrevival of interest in the philosophy of Aristotle and into Late\nAntiquity, the Categories remained a tantalizing puzzle. Not\nonly its title, but also its unity, structure and place in the\nAristotelian corpus were intensely discussed. Various titles are\nattested in the tradition: Introduction to the Topics, On\nthe Genera of Being, On the Ten Genera, The Ten\nCategories, Categories (Simplicius, In Cat. 15.\n26–30). Each of these titles reflected a certain interpretation\nof what the treatise is about. Andronicus is the first interpreter who\nis known to have preferred the title Categories. He rejected\nthe title Introduction to the Topics and considered the final\nchapters of the Categories—the so-called\nPostpraedicamenta—a later addition contrary to the\npurpose of the book. He held that the people who added those chapters\nalso inscribed the book with the title Introduction to the\nTopics (Simplicius, In Cat. 279. 8–10). By\ncontrast, Adrastus of Aphrodisias defended the relationship between\nthe Categories and the Topics in a work entitled\nConcerning the Order of Aristotle’s Treatises\n(Simplicius, In Cat. 16. 1–4). The dispute was not\nconfined to the organization Aristotle’s works, but it clearly\nextended to the philosophical significance of the treatise. The title\nCategories eventually prevailed, and along with the title a\ncertain interpretation of the treatise. \nThe impression that, from very early on, the interpreters were\nstruggling to understand Aristotle is confirmed by the commentary\ntradition on the De anima. Consider, for example, De\nanima 3.5. There, Aristotle famously argues for the existence of an\nintellect that is separate, unaffected, and unmixed (De\nanima 430 a\n17–18). In antiquity commentators traditionally referred to this\nintellect as the active (or productive) intellect, nous\npoiêtikos. Discussion on how exactly this intellect is to\nbe understood started very early. There is evidence that already\nTheophrastus puzzled over it (Themistius, In De anima\n110.18–28). Among other things, it is not obvious what sort of\nthing the active intellect is supposed to be. More directly, it is not\nclear whether it is a human or a divine intellect. What Aristotle says\noutside of the De anima is equally perplexing. In his work\nOn the Generation of Animals Aristotle speaks of an intellect that\nenters “from without” (736 b 27). But it is\nnot at all clear how the comment that Aristotle makes in this context\nis to be understood. What exactly is the status of this enigmatic\nintellect? How does it fit with the discussion offered in the De\nanima? \nAlexander of Aphrodisias developed a line of interpretation that made\nthe active intellect a non-human intellect and identified it with God.\nHis commentary on the De anima is lost. Instead we have the\nDe anima that he wrote following the principles that\nAristotle had established in his own De anima. There,\nAlexander identifies the active intellect with “the first cause,\nwhich is the cause and principle of existence to all the other\nthings” (Alexander, De anima 89. 9–10). The intellect\nso understood is not only the cause of human thought; it is also the\ncause of the existence of everything that there is in the universe.\nThis intellect can also be an object of thought. When this happens,\nthis intellect enters in us from without: “this is the intellect\nfrom without which comes to be in us and is imperishable”\n(Alexander, De anima 90.19–20). Alexander makes it abundantly\nclear that this intellect alone is imperishable and as such it is also\ndivine. A similar but not identical attempt to expand on the\nelliptical remarks that Aristotle has left on the active intellect can\nbe found in the On Intellect, a short essay attributed to\nAlexander of Aphrodisias and preserved in the collection of brief\nexegetical writings known to us as Mantissa. \nAnother text that has important implications for the reception of\nAristotle’s treatment of the intellect is the paraphrase of the\nDe anima that Themistius wrote around 350 CE. There,\nThemistius argues that the active intellect is the most accurate\nspecification of the human form (In De anima 100.35–36). Put\ndifferently, our essence as human beings is the active intellect\n(In De anima 100.36–101.1). Although Themistius does not name\nnames, he is clearly reacting against the reading advanced by\nAlexander of Aphrodisias. For Themistius the active intellect is not\nGod or the supreme principle upon which everything depends for its\nexistence. For him, the active intellect is an integral part of the\nhuman soul: “the active intellect is in the soul and it is like\nthe most honourable part of the human soul” (In De anima\n103.4–5). Although the active intellect so understood is a human\nintellect, it is emphatically not conceived of as a personal\nintellect. Themistius is adamantly clear that there is only one\nseparate, unmixed and unaffected active intellect. Likewise, there is\nonly one separate, unmixed and unaffected potential intellect,\nnous dunamei. According to Themistius, both the active and\nthe potential intellects are not subject to generation and perishing.\nWhat is perishable is only the common or passive intellect,\nkoinon or pathêtikos nous. This third\nintellect is mixed with the body and its fate is to perish along with\nthe body (In De anima 105.28–29; 106.14–15). \nBeginning some time in the fourth century CE, Aristotle’s\nOrganon established itself as part of the reading curriculum\nin the Latin tradition. Like the Greek tradition, the Latin tradition\nemployed a great variety of exegetical tools in the teaching of\nAristotle: paraphrases, elementary as well as more advanced\ncommentaries. In addition, the Latin tradition was confronted with the\nspecific problem of providing the students with adequate translations\nof the relevant texts. \nThe tradition credits Marius Victorinus (fourth century CE) with a\ntranslation of the Categories, the De\nInterpretatione, and Porphyry’s Isagoge\n(Cassiodorus, Instit. II, 3, 18). The same tradition credits\nhim with a commentary in eight books on the Categories. A few\nyears later Vettius Agorius Praetextatus is known to have translated\nthe Greek paraphrases of the Prior and Posterior\nAnalytics produced by Themistius (Boethius, De\nInt.2 3.6–4.3). None of these works have reached\nus, with the exception of excerpts from Victorinus’ translation\nof the Isagoge. An anonymous paraphrase of the\nCategories falsely attributed to Augustine and traditionally\nknown as Categoriae Decem has survived only because it was\nwidely read and used in the early Middle Ages. Finally, an incomplete\nparaphrase of the Categories is preserved in Martianus\nCapella’s On Dialectic (the forth book of his The\nMarriage of Philosophy and Mercury, an influential textbook on\nthe seven liberal arts dating from the fifth century CE). Even these\nfew remarks suffice to document a sustained effort to provide the\nstudents with a Latin Organon that reflected the teaching\nneeds of the time. \nThe key figure for the reception of Aristotle in the Latin world was\nBoethius. Best known for his Consolation of Philosophy,\nBoethius (c. 475–526) was the transmitter of the\nAristotelian logical tradition to the early Middle Ages. His attitude\nto the text of Aristotle and Plato was not different from that of the\nother commentators of Late Antiquity. He regarded Plato and Aristotle\nas philosophical authorities and was persuaded that the best way to do\nphilosophy was to read and comment on their works. Like the Platonists\nof Late Antiquity, he was convinced that Plato and Aristotle were in\nbasic agreement, and that Aristotle’s thought was to be\nunderstood as a genuine development of Plato’s. In this frame of\nmind, Boethius planned to translate all the works of Aristotle that he\ncould find along with all the dialogues of Plato, and to comment on\nall of them in order to show that Plato and Aristotle agreed on the\nmost significant philosophical points (Boethius De\nInt.2 79. 9–80.9). \nBoethius was able to execute this plan only in part. He managed to\ntranslate the Categories, the De Interpretatione,\nthe Prior Analytics, the Topics and the\nSophistical Refutations. In addition, he translated\nPorphyry’s Isagoge. Boethius produced two commentaries\non the Isagoge. Along with these commentaries, he\nwrote two commentaries on the De Interpretatione. \nThe practice of writing double commentaries is to be understood in the\nlight of the concern for pedagogy that motivates the entire commentary\ntradition. Here is how Boethius explains why he wrote two commentaries\n(or rather two versions of the same commentary) on the De\nInterpretatione: \nBoethius also wrote a commentary on the Categories. This\ncommentary was intended to be an elementary exposition of the\ntreatise. Boethius planned to write a second exposition, addressed to\nmore advanced students (Boethius In Cat. 160 A-B). It is just\nunclear whether he was able to produce this more advanced commentary.\n(For further information on Boethius as a commentator, see Section 2\nof the entry on\n Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius.) \nThe exegetical labor on the Isagoge, the Categories\nand the De Intepretatione continued after Boethius. This\nlabor took often the form of glosses, that is, annotations written in\nmargin of copies of the Isagoge, the Categories and\nthe De Interpretatione. A survey of the exegetical results\nreached in the early Latin Medieval tradition goes beyond the scope of\nthis entry. I refer the reader to the Bibliography for further reading\non the commentary tradition in the early Middle Ages. \nThere is no philosophy of the commentators in the sense of a definite\nset of doctrines that all the ancient commentators on Aristotle\nshared. What they shared was the practice of reading and commenting on\nthe texts of Aristotle on the crucial assumption that Aristotle was a\nphilosophical authority and his works deserved to be studied with\ngreat care. \nDue to the almost complete loss of the relevant literature, we know\nvery little about the first generation of interpreters of Aristotle.\nNo picture of unity emerges from the little that has reached us. The\nnotion that all these interpreters wrote commentaries is not supported\nby the information in our possession. The commentary eventually became\nthe standard form of exegesis. But even within the commentary\ntradition there was room for a plurality of exegetical positions.\nDifferent commentators developed different lines of interpretations in\nthe light of the different concerns that motivated their exegesis. The\nexegetical tradition that finds its culmination in Alexander of\nAphrodisias was primarily (but not exclusively) motivated by an\nattempt to defend the philosophy of Aristotle in the context of the\nancient debate between philosophical schools. Alexander of Aphrodisias\nviewed Aristotle as his master and devoted his exegetical works to\nexplicate and extract Aristotle’s distinctive philosophical\nposition. While the Platonists of Late Antiquity put themselves in\ncontinuity with this tradition, their exegesis was largely an attempt\nto develop a philosophy that insisted on the continuity between Plato\nand Aristotle. They wrote their commentaries on the assumption that\nAristotle and Plato were in substantial agreement.","contact.mail":"Andrea.Falcon@concordia.ca","contact.domain":"concordia.ca"}]
