Just as electrons and planets exist independently of us, so\ndo numbers and sets. And just as statements about electrons and planets\nare made true or false by the objects with which they are concerned and\nthese objects’ perfectly objective properties, so are statements about\nnumbers and sets. Mathematical truths are therefore discovered, not\ninvented.\n\n\n\nThe most important argument for the existence of abstract\nmathematical objects derives from Gottlob Frege and goes as follows\n(Frege 1953). The language of mathematics purports to refer to and\nquantify over abstract mathematical objects. And a great number of\nmathematical theorems are true. But a sentence cannot be true unless\nits sub-expressions succeed in doing what they purport to do. So there\nexist abstract mathematical objects that these expressions refer to and\nquantify over.\n\n\n\nFrege’s argument notwithstanding, philosophers have developed a\nvariety of objections to mathematical platonism. Thus, abstract\nmathematical objects are claimed to be epistemologically inaccessible\nand metaphysically problematic. Mathematical platonism has been among\nthe most hotly debated topics in the philosophy of mathematics over the\npast few decades.\n\n\n\nMathematical platonism can be defined as the conjunction of the\nfollowing three theses: Existence.\n  There are mathematical objects. Abstractness.\n   Mathematical objects are abstract. Independence.\n   Mathematical objects are independent\n    of intelligent agents and their language, thought, and practices. \n\nSome representative definitions of ‘mathematical\nplatonism’ are listed in the supplement \nSome Definitions of Platonism\n \n\nand document that the above definition is fairly standard. \n\nPlatonism in general (as opposed to platonism about mathematics\nspecifically) is any view that arises from the above three claims by\nreplacing the adjective ‘mathematical’ by any other\nadjective. \n\nThe first two claims are tolerably clear for present purposes.\nExistence can be formalized as\n‘∃xMx’, where\n‘Mx’ abbreviates the predicate ‘x\nis a mathematical object’ which is true of all and only the\nobjects studied by pure mathematics, such as numbers, sets, and\nfunctions. Abstractness says that every mathematical object is\nabstract, where an object is said to be abstract just in case it is\nnon-spatiotemporal and (therefore) causally inefficacious. (For further\ndiscussion, see the entry on\n abstract objects.) \n\nIndependence is less clear than the other two claims. What does it\nmean to ascribe this sort of independence to an object? The most\nobvious gloss is probably the counterfactual conditional that, had\nthere not been any intelligent agents, or had their language, thought,\nor practices been different, there would still have been mathematical\nobjects. However, it is doubtful that this gloss will do all the work that\nIndependence is supposed to do (see Section\n 4.1). For now, Independence will\nbe left somewhat schematic. \n\nPlatonism must be distinguished from the view of the historical\nPlato. Few parties to the contemporary debate about platonism make\nstrong exegetical claims about Plato’s view, much less defend it.\nAlthough the view which we are calling ‘platonism’ is\ninspired by Plato’s famous theory of abstract and eternal Forms (see\nthe entry on\n Plato’s metaphysics and epistemology),\n platonism is now defined and debated\nindependently of its original historical inspiration. \n\nNot only is the platonism under discussion not Plato’s, platonism as\ncharacterized above is a purely metaphysical view: it should be\ndistinguished from other views that have substantive epistemological\ncontent. Many older characterizations of platonism add strong\nepistemological claims to the effect that we have some immediate grasp\nof, or insight into, the realm of abstract objects. (See e.g., Rees\n1967.) But it is useful (and nowadays fairly standard) to reserve the\nterm ‘platonism’ for the purely metaphysical view described\nabove. Many philosophers who defend platonism in this purely\nmetaphysical sense would reject the additional epistemological claims.\nExamples include Quine and other philosophers attracted to the\nso-called indispensability argument, which seeks to give a\nbroadly empirical defense of mathematical platonism. (See the entry\n on\n indispensability arguments in the philosophy of mathematics.) \n\nFinally, the above definition of ‘mathematical\nplatonism’ excludes the claim that all truths of pure mathematics\nare necessary, although this claim has traditionally been made by most\nplatonists. Again, this exclusion is justified by the fact that some\nphilosophers who are generally regarded as platonists (for instance,\nQuine and some adherents of the aforementioned indispensability\nargument) reject this additional modal claim . \n\nMathematical platonism has considerable philosophical significance.\nIf the view is true, it will put great pressure on the physicalist idea\nthat reality is exhausted by the physical. For platonism entails that\nreality extends far beyond the physical world and includes objects\nwhich aren’t part of the causal and spatiotemporal order studied by the\nphysical\n sciences.[1]\nMathematical platonism, if true, will also\nput great pressure on many naturalistic theories of knowledge. For\nthere is little doubt that we possess mathematical knowledge.\nThe truth of mathematical platonism would therefore establish that we have knowledge\nof abstract (and thus causally inefficacious) objects. This would be an\nimportant discovery, which many naturalistic theories of knowledge\nwould struggle to  accommodate. \n\nAlthough these philosophical consequences are not unique to\nmathematical platonism, this particular form of platonism is\nunusually well suited to support such consequences. For mathematics is\na remarkably successful discipline, both in its own right and as a tool\nfor other\n sciences.[2]\n Few contemporary analytic philosophers are\nwilling to contradict any of the core claims of a discipline whose\nscientific credentials are as strong as those of mathematics (Lewis\n1991, pp. 57–9). So if philosophical analysis revealed\nmathematics to have some strange and surprising consequences, it would\nbe unattractive simply to reject\n mathematics.[3]\n A form of platonism based\non a discipline whose scientific credentials are less impressive than\nthose of mathematics would not be in this fortunate situation. For\ninstance, when theology turns out to have some strange and surprising\nphilosophical consequences, many philosophers do not hesitate to\nreject the relevant parts of theology. \n\nLet object realism be the view that there exist abstract\nmathematical objects. Object realism is thus just the conjunction\nof Existence and\nAbstractness.[4] \nObject realism stands opposed\nto nominalism, which in contemporary philosophy is typically\ndefined as the view that there are no abstract objects. (In more\ntraditional philosophical usage the word ‘nominalism’\nrefers instead to the view that there are no universals. See Burgess\n& Rosen 1997, pp. 13–25 and the entry\non abstract objects.)\n \nBecause object realism leaves out Independence, this view is\nlogically weaker than mathematical platonism. The philosophical\nconsequences of object realism are thus not as strong as those of\nplatonism. Many physicalists would accept non-physical objects\nprovided that these are dependent on or reducible to physical\nobjects. They may for instance accept objects such as corporations,\nlaws, and poems, provided that these are suitably dependent or\nreducible to physical objects. Moreover, there appears to be no\nmystery about epistemic access to non-physical objects that we have\nsomehow made or ‘constituted’. If corporations, laws, and\npoems are made or ‘constituted’ by us, presumably we gain\nknowledge of them in the process of making or\n‘constituting’ them. \n\nSome views in the philosophy of mathematics are object realist\nwithout being platonist. One example are traditional intuitionist\nviews, which affirm the existence of mathematical objects but maintain\nthat these objects depend on or are constituted by mathematicians and\ntheir\n activities.[5]\n Some further examples of views that are\nobject realist without being platonist will be discussed in Section\n 4. \n\nTruth-value realism is the view that every well-formed\nmathematical statement has a unique and objective truth-value that is\nindependent of whether it can be known by us and whether it follows\nlogically from our current mathematical theories. The view also holds\nthat most mathematical statements that are deemed to be true are in\nfact true.  So truth-value realism is clearly a\nmetaphysical view. But unlike platonism it is not an\nontological view. For although truth-value realism claims\nthat mathematical statements have unique and objective truth-values,\nit is not committed to the distinctively platonist idea that these\ntruth-values are to be explained in terms of an ontology of\nmathematical objects. \n\nMathematical platonism clearly motivates truth-value realism by\nproviding an account of how mathematical statements get their\ntruth-values. But the former view does not entail the latter unless\nfurther premises are added. For even if there are mathematical\nobjects, referential and quantificational indeterminacy may deprive\nmathematical statements of a unique and objective\ntruth-value. Conversely, truth-value realism does not by itself\nentail Existence and thus implies neither object realism nor\nplatonism. For there are various accounts of how mathematical\nstatements can come to possess unique and objective truth-values which\ndo not posit a realm of mathematical\nobjects.[6] \n\nIn fact, many nominalists endorse truth-value realism, at least\nabout more basic branches of mathematics, such as arithmetic.\nNominalists of this type are committed to the slightly odd-sounding\nview that, although the ordinary mathematical statement \n(1) There are primes numbers between 10 and 20.\n \n\nis true, there are in fact no mathematical objects and thus in\nparticular no numbers. But there is no contradiction here. We must\ndistinguish between the language LM in which mathematicians\nmake their claims and the language LP in which nominalists\nand other philosophers make theirs. The statement (1) is made in\nLM. But the nominalist’s assertion that (1) is\ntrue but that there are no abstract objects is made\nin LP. The nominalist’s assertion is thus\nperfectly coherent provided that (1) is translated non-homophonically\nfrom LM into LP.  And indeed,\nwhen the nominalist claims that the truth-values of sentences\nof LM are fixed in a way which doesn’t appeal to\nmathematical objects, it is precisely this sort of non-homophonic\ntranslation she has in mind. The view mentioned in the previous note\nprovides an example. \n\nThis shows that for the claim Existence to have its intended\neffect, it must be expressed in the language LP\nused by us philosophers. If the claim was expressed in the\nlanguage LM used by mathematicians, then\nnominalists could accept the claim while still denying that there are\nmathematical objects, contrary to the purpose of the claim. \n\nA small but important tradition of philosophers urge that the debate\nabout platonism should be replaced by, or at least transformed into, a\ndebate about truth-value realism. One reason offered in support of this view is\nthat the former debate is hopelessly unclear, while the latter is more\ntractable (Dummett 1978a, pp. 228–232 and Dummett 1991b, pp.\n10–15). Another reason offered is that the debate about\ntruth-value realism is of greater importance to both philosophy and\nmathematics than the one about\n platonism.[7] \n\nWorking realism is the methodological view that mathematics\nshould be practiced as if platonism was true (Bernays 1935,\nShapiro 1997, pp. 21–27 and 38–44). This requires some\nexplanation. In debates about the foundations of mathematics platonism\nhas often been used to defend certain mathematical methods, such as the\nfollowing: \n\nAccording to working realism, these and other classical methods are\nacceptable and available in all mathematical reasoning. But working\nrealism does not take a stand on whether these methods require any\nphilosophical defense, and if so, whether this defense must be based on\nplatonism. In short, where platonism is an explicitly philosophical\nview, working realism is first and foremost a view within mathematics\nitself about the correct methodology of this discipline. Platonism and\nworking realism are therefore distinct views. \n\nHowever, there may of course be logical relations between the two\nviews. Given the origin of working realism, it is not surprising that\nthe view receives strong support from mathematical platonism. Assume\nthat mathematical platonism is true. Then clearly the language of\nmathematics ought to be as described in (i). Secondly, provided it is\nlegitimate to reason classically about any independently existing part\nof reality, (ii) would also follow. Thirdly, since platonism ensures\nthat mathematics is discovered rather than invented, there would be no\nneed for mathematicians to restrict themselves to constructive methods\nand axioms, which establishes (iii). Fourth, there is a powerful and\ninfluential argument due to Gödel (1944) that impredicative\ndefinitions are legitimate whenever the objects being defined exist\nindependently of our definitions. (For instance, ‘the tallest\nboy in the class’ appears unproblematic despite being\nimpredicative.)  If this is correct, then (iv) would follow. Finally,\nif mathematics is about some independently existing reality, then\nevery mathematical problem has a unique and determinate answer, which\nprovides at least some motivation for Hilbertian optimism. (See,\nhowever, the discussion of plenitudinous platonism in Section\n 4.2.) \n\nThe truth of mathematical platonism would therefore have important\nconsequences within mathematics itself. It would justify the classical\nmethods associated with working realism and encourage the search for\nnew axioms to settle questions (such as the Continuum Hypothesis) which\nare left open by our current mathematical theories. \n\nHowever, working realism does not in any obvious way imply\nplatonism. Although working realism says that we are justified in\nusing the platonistic language of contemporary mathematics, this falls\nshort of platonism in at least two ways. As the above discussion of\ntruth-value realism showed, the platonistic language of mathematics\ncan be analysed in such a way as to avoid reference to and\nquantification over mathematical objects. Moreover, even if a\nface-value analysis of the language of mathematics could be justified,\nthis would support object realism but not platonism. An\nadditional argument would be needed for the third component of\nplatonism, namely, Independence. The prospects for such an\nargument are discussed in Section\n 4.1. \n\nWe now describe a template of an argument for the existence of\nmathematical objects. Since the first philosopher who developed an\nargument of this general form was Frege, it will be referred to as\nthe Fregean argument. But the template is general and\nabstracts away from most specific aspects of Frege’s own defense of the\nexistence of mathematical objects, such as his view that arithmetic is\nreducible to logic. Fregean logicism is just one way in which this\ntemplate can be developed; some other ways will be mentioned below. \n\nThe Fregean argument is based on two premises, the first of which\nconcerns the semantics of the language of mathematics: \n  Classical Semantics.\n  The singular terms of the\nlanguage of mathematics purport to refer to mathematical objects, and\nits first-order quantifiers purport to range over such objects.\n \n\nThe word ‘purport’ needs to be explained. When a\nsentence S purports to refer or quantify in a certain way,\nthis means that for S to be true, S must succeed in\nreferring or quantifying in this way. \n\nThe second premise does not require much explanation: \nTruth.\n Most sentences accepted as mathematical\ntheorems are true (regardless of their syntactic and semantic\nstructure).\n  \n\nConsider sentences which are accepted as mathematical theorems and\nwhich contain one or more mathematical singular terms. By Truth, most\nof these sentences are\n true.[9]\n Let S be one such sentence. By Classical Semantics, the truth\nof S requires that its singular terms succeed in referring to\nmathematical objects. Hence there must be mathematical objects, as\nasserted by\n Existence.[10] \n\nClassical Semantics claims that the language of mathematics\nfunctions semantically much like language in general functions (or at\nleast has traditionally been assumed to function): the semantic\nfunctions of singular terms and quantifiers are to refer\nto objects and to range over objects, respectively. This is a broadly empirical claim\nabout the workings of a semi-formal language used by the community of\nprofessional mathematicians. (In the widely adopted terminology of\nBurgess & Rosen 1997, pp. 6–7, Classical Semantics is a\nhermeneutic claim; that is, it is a descriptive claim about\nhow a certain language is actually used, not a normative claim about\nhow this language ought to be used.) Note also that Classical Semantics\nis compatible with most traditional views on semantics; in particular,\nit is compatible with all the standard views on the meanings of\nsentences, namely that they are truth-values, propositions, or sets of\npossible worlds. \n\nClassical Semantics enjoys strong prima facie plausibility.\nFor the language of mathematics strongly appears to have the same\nsemantic structure as ordinary non-mathematical language. As Burgess\n(1999) observes, the following two sentences appear to have the same\nsimple semantic structure of a predicate being ascribed to a subject\n(p. 288): (4) Evelyn is prim. (5) Eleven is prime. \n\nThis appearance is also borne out by the standard semantic analyses\nproposed by linguists and semanticists. \n\nClassical Semantics has nevertheless been challenged, for\ninstance by nominalists such as Hellman (1989) and by Hofweber\n(2005 and 2016). (See also Moltmann (2013) for some challenges concerned with\narithmetical vocabulary in natural language.) This is not the place\nfor an extended discussion of such challenges. Let me just note that a\nlot of work is needed to substantiate this sort of challenge. The\nchallenger will have to argue that the apparent semantic similarities\nbetween mathematical and non-mathematical language are deceptive. And\nthese arguments will have to be of the sort that linguists and\nsemanticists—with no vested interest in the philosophy of\nmathematics—could come to recognize as\nsignificant.[11] \n\nTruth can be defended in a variety of different ways. Common to all\ndefenses is that they first identify some standard by which the\ntruth-values of mathematical statements can be assessed and then argue\nthat mathematical theorems meet this standard. \n\nOne option is to appeal to a standard that is more fundamental than\nthat of mathematics itself. Logicism provides an example. Frege and\nother logicists first claim that any theorem of pure logic is true.\nThen they attempt to show that the theorems of certain branches of\nmathematics can be proved from pure logic and definitions alone. \n\nAnother option is to appeal to the standards of empirical science.\nThe Quine-Putnam indispensability argument provides an example. First\nit is argued that any indispensable part of empirical science is\nlikely to be true and therefore something we are justified in\nbelieving. Then it is argued that large amounts of mathematics are\nindispensable to empirical science. If both claims are correct, it\nfollows that Truth is likely to be true and that belief\nin Truth therefore is justified. (See the entry on\n indispensability arguments in the philosophy of mathematics.) \n\nA third option is to appeal to the standards of mathematics itself.\nWhy should one have to appeal to non-mathematical standards, such as\nthose of logic or empirical science, in order to defend the truth of\nmathematical theorems? When we defend the truth of the claims of logic\nand physics, we do not need to appeal to standards outside of\nrespectively logic and physics. Rather we assume that logic and physics\nprovide their own sui generis standards of justification. Why\nshould mathematics be any different? This third strategy has received a\nlot of attention in recent years, often under the heading of\n‘naturalism’ or ‘mathematical naturalism’. (See\nBurgess & Rosen 1997, Maddy 1997, and, for critical discussion,\nsee the entry on\n naturalism in the philosophy of mathematics.) \n\nHere is an example of how a naturalistic strategy can be developed.\nCall the attitude that mathematicians take to the theorems of\nmathematics ‘acceptance’. Then the following claims seem\nplausible: (6) Mathematicians are justified in accepting the theorems\nof mathematics. (7) Accepting a mathematical statement S involves\ntaking S to be true. (8) When a mathematician accepts a mathematical statement\nS, the content of this attitude is in general the literal\nmeaning of S. \n\nFrom these three claims it follows that mathematical experts are\njustified in taking the theorems of mathematics to be literal truths.\nBy extension the rest of us too are justified in believing Truth. Note\nthat the experts with whom (6) is concerned need not themselves believe\n(7) and (8), let alone be justified in any such belief. What matters is\nthat the three claims are true. The task of establishing the truth of\n(7) and (8) may fall to linguists, psychologists, sociologists, or\nphilosophers, but certainly not to mathematicians themselves. \n\nVersions of the Fregean argument are sometimes stated in terms of\nthe notion of ontological commitment. Assume we operate with the\nstandard Quinean criterion of ontological commitment: \nQuine’s Criterion.\n A first-order sentence (or\ncollection of such sentences) is ontologically committed to such\nobjects as must be assumed to be in the range of the variables for the\nsentence (or collection of sentences) to be true.\n \n\nThen it follows from Classical Semantics that many sentences of\nmathematics are ontologically committed to mathematical objects. To see\nthis, consider a typical mathematical theorem S, which\ninvolves some normal extensional occurrence of either singular terms or\nfirst-order quantifiers. By Classical Semantics, these expressions\npurport to refer to or range over mathematical objects. For S\nto be true, these expressions must succeed in doing what they purport\nto do. Consequently, for S to be true, there must be\nmathematical objects in the range of the variables. By Quine’s\nCriterion this means that S is ontologically committed to\nmathematical objects. \n\nQuine and many others take Quine’s Criterion to be little more than\na definition of the term ‘ontological commitment’ (Quine\n1969 and Burgess 2004). But the criterion has nevertheless been\nchallenged. Some philosophers deny that singular terms and first-order\nquantifiers automatically give rise to ontological commitments. Perhaps\nwhat is “required of the world” for the sentence to be true\ninvolves the existence of some but not all of the objects in the range\nof the quantifiers (Rayo 2008). Or perhaps we should sever the link\nbetween the first-order existential quantifier and the notion of\nontological commitment (Azzouni 2004, Hofweber 2000 and 2016). \n\nOne response to these challenges is to observe that the Fregean\nargument was developed above without any use of the term\n‘ontological commitment’. Any challenge to the definition\nof ‘ontological commitment’ provided by Quine’s\nCriterion therefore appears irrelevant to the version of the\nFregean argument developed above. However, this response is unlikely\nto satisfy the challengers, who will respond that the conclusion of\nthe argument developed above is too weak to have its intended\neffect. Recall that the conclusion, Existence, is formalized in\nour philosophical meta-language LP as\n‘∃xMx’. So this formalization will\nfail to have its intended effect unless this meta-language sentence is\nof the sort that incurs ontological commitment. But that is precisely\nwhat the challengers dispute. This controversy cannot be pursued\nfurther here. For now, we simply observe that the challengers need to provide an\naccount of why their non-standard notion of ontological commitment is\nbetter and theoretically more interesting than the standard Quinean\nnotion. \n\nSuppose we accept Existence, perhaps based on the Fregean\nargument. As we have seen, this is not yet to accept mathematical\nplatonism, which is the result of adding to\nExistence the two further claims Abstractness and\nIndependence. Are these two further claims defensible? \n\nBy the standards of philosophy, Abstractness has remained\nrelatively uncontroversial. Among the few philosophers to have\nchallenged it are Maddy (1990) (concerning impure sets) and Bigelow\n(1988) (concerning sets and various kinds of numbers). This relative\nlack of controversy means that few explicit defenses\nof Abstractness have been developed.  But it is not hard to see\nhow such a defense might go. Here is one idea. It is a\nplausible prima facie constraint on any philosophical\ninterpretation of mathematical practice that it should avoid ascribing\nto mathematics any features which would render actual mathematical\npractice misguided or inadequate. This constraint makes it hard to\ndeny that the objects of pure mathematics are abstract. For if these\nobjects had spatiotemporal locations, then actual mathematical\npractice would be misguided and inadequate, since pure mathematicians\nought then to take an interest in the locations of their objects, just\nas zoologists take an interest in the locations of animals. The fact\nthat pure mathematicians take no interest in this question suggests\nthat their objects are abstract. \n\nIndependence says that mathematical objects, if there are any,\nare independent of intelligent agents and their language, thought, and\npractices. We will discuss what this thesis might amount to, and how it might be defended, in Section\n 4. \n\n \n\nA variety of objections to mathematical platonism have been\ndeveloped. Here are the most important ones. \n\nThe most influential objection is probably the one inspired by\nBenacerraf (1973). What follows is an improved version of Benacerraf’s\nobjection due to Field\n (1989).[12]\n This version relies on the following three premises. \n\nIf these three premises are correct, it will follow that\nmathematical platonism undercuts our justification for believing in\nmathematics. \n\nBut are the premises correct? The first two premises are relatively\nuncontroversial. Most platonists are already committed to Premise 1.\nAnd Premise 2 seems fairly secure. If the reliability of some belief\nformation procedure could not even in principle be explained, then the\nprocedure would seem to work purely by chance, thus undercutting any\njustification we have for the beliefs produced in this way. \n\nPremise 3 is far more controversial. Field defends this premise by\nobserving that “the truth-values of our mathematical assertions\ndepend on facts involving platonic entities that reside in a realm\noutside of space-time” (Field 1989, p. 68) and thus are causally\nisolated from us even in principle. However, this defense assumes that\nany adequate explanation of the reliability in question must involve\nsome causal correlation. This has been challenged by a variety of\nphilosophers who have proposed more minimal explanations of the\nreliability claim. (See Burgess & Rosen 1997, pp. 41–49 and\nLewis 1991, pp. 111–112; cf. also Clarke-Doane 2016. See Linnebo\n2006 for a \ncritique.)[13] \n\nAnother famous article by Benacerraf develops a metaphysical objection\nto mathematical platonism (Benacerraf 1965, cf. also Kitcher\n1978). Although Benacerraf focuses on arithmetic, the objection\nnaturally generalizes to most pure mathematical objects. \n\nBenacerraf opens by defending what is now known as a structuralist\nview of the natural numbers, according to which the natural numbers\nhave no properties other than those they have in virtue of being\npositions in an ω-sequence. For instance, there is nothing more\nto being the number 3 than having certain intrastructurally defined\nrelational properties, such as succeeding 2, being half of 6, and being\nprime. No matter how hard we study arithmetic and set theory, we will\nnever know whether 3 is identical with the fourth von Neumann ordinal,\nor with the corresponding Zermelo ordinal, or perhaps, as Frege\nsuggested, with the class of all three-membered classes (in some system\nthat allows such classes to exist). \n\nBenacerraf now draws the following conclusion: \n\nIn other words, Benacerraf claims that there can be no objects which\nhave nothing but structural properties. All objects must have some\nnon-structural properties as well. (See Benacerraf 1996 for some\nlater reflections on this argument.) \n\nBoth of the steps of Benacerraf’s argument are\ncontroversial. The first step—that natural numbers have only\nstructural properties—has recently been defended by a variety of\nmathematical structuralists (Parsons 1990, Resnik 1997, and Shapiro\n1997). But this step is denied by logicists and neo-logicists, who\nclaim that the natural numbers are intrinsically tied to the\ncardinalities of the collections that they number. And the second\nstep—that there can be no objects with only structural\nproperties—is explicitly rejected by all of the structuralists\nwho defend the first step. (For some voices sympathetic to the second\nstep, see Hellman 2001 and MacBride 2005. See also Linnebo 2008 for\ndiscussion.) \n\nIn addition to Benacerraf’s, a variety of metaphysical objections to\nmathematical platonism have been developed. One of the more famous\nexamples is an argument of Nelson Goodman’s against set\ntheory. Goodman (1956) defends the Principle of Nominalism,\nwhich states that whenever two entities have the same basic\nconstituents, they are identical. This principle can be regarded as a\nstrengthening of the familiar set theoretic axiom of\nextensionality. The axiom of extensionality states that if two\nsets x and y have the same elements—that is,\nif ∀u(u ∈ x ↔ u\n∈ y)—then they are identical. The Principle of\nNominalism is obtained by replacing the membership relation with its\ntransitive\n closure.[14]\n The principle thus states that if x and y are borne\n∈* by the same individuals—that is,\nif ∀u(u ∈* x ↔ u ∈*\ny)—then x and y are identical. By\nendorsing this principle, Goodman disallows the formation of sets and\nclasses, allowing only the formation of mereological sums and the\napplication to the standard mereological operations (as described by\nhis “calculus of individuals”). \n\nHowever, Goodman’s defense of the Principle of Nominalism is now\nwidely held to be unconvincing, as witnessed by the widespread\nacceptance by philosophers and mathematicians of set theory as a\nlegitimate and valuable branch of mathematics. \n\nObject realism says there exist abstract mathematical objects,\nwhereas platonism adds Independence, which says that mathematical\nobjects are independent of intelligent agents and their language,\nthought, and practices. This final section\nsurveys some lightweight forms of object realism that stop short of full-fledged platonism. \n\nA natural gloss on Independence is the counterfactual\nconditional that, had there not been any intelligent agents, or had\ntheir language, thought, or practices been suitably different, there\nwould still have been mathematical objects.\n\n \n\nThis counterfactual independence (as we may call it) is accepted by\nmost analytic philosophers. To see why, consider the role that\nmathematics plays in our reasoning. We often reason about scenarios\nthat aren’t actual. Were we to build a bridge across this canyon, say,\nhow strong would it have to be to withstand the powerful gusts of\nwind? Sadly, the previous bridge collapsed. Would it have done so had\nthe steel girders been twice as thick? This form of reasoning about\ncounterfactual scenarios is indispensable both to our everyday\ndeliberations and to science. The permissibility of such reasoning has\nan important consequence. Since the truths of pure mathematics can\nfreely be appealed to throughout our counterfactual reasoning, it\nfollows that these truths are counterfactually independent of us\nhumans, and all other intelligent life for that matter. That is, had\nbeen there been no intelligent life, these truths would still have\nremained the same.  \n\nPure mathematics is in this respect very different from ordinary\nempirical truths. Had intelligent life never existed, this article\nwould not have been written. More interestingly, pure mathematics also\ncontrasts with various social conventions and constructions, with\nwhich it is sometimes compared (Cole 2009, Feferman 2009, Hersh\n1997). Had intelligent life never existed, there would have been no\nlaws, contracts, or marriages—yet the mathematical truths would\nhave remained the same.  \n\nThus, if Independence is understood merely as counterfactual\nindependence, then anyone who accepts object realism should also\naccept platonism.  \n\nIt is doubtful that this understanding of Independence is\nsufficient, however. For Independence is meant to substantiate\nan analogy between mathematical objects and ordinary physical\nobjects. Just as electrons and planets exist independently of us, so\ndo numbers and sets. And just as statements about electrons and\nplanets are made true or false by the objects with which they are\nconcerned and these objects’ perfectly objective properties, so are\nstatements about numbers and sets. In short, mathematical objects are\njust as “real” as ordinary physical objects (if not even more so, as\nPlato thought).  \n\nLet us now consider some views that reject this stronger understanding\nof Independence in terms of the mentioned analogy. These views\nare thus lightweight forms of object realism, which stop short of\nfull-blown platonism.  \n\nOne lightweight form of object realism is the “full-blooded\nplatonism” of Balaguer 1998. This view is characterized by\na plenitude principle to the effect that any mathematical\nobjects that could exist actually do exist. For instance, since the\nContinuum Hypothesis is independent of the standard axiomatization of\nset theory, there is a universe of sets in which the hypothesis is\ntrue and another in which it is false. And neither universe is\nmetaphysically privileged. By contrast, traditional platonism asserts\nthat there is a unique universe of sets in which the Continuum\nHypothesis is either determinately true or determinately\nfalse.[15] \n\nOne alleged benefit of this plenitudinous view is in the\nepistemology of mathematics. If every consistent mathematical theory is\ntrue of some universe of mathematical objects, then mathematical\nknowledge will, in some sense, be easy to obtain: provided that our\nmathematical theories are consistent, they are guaranteed to be true of\nsome universe of mathematical objects. \n\nHowever, “full-blooded platonism” has received much\ncriticism. Colyvan and Zalta 1999 criticize it for undermining the\npossibility of reference to mathematical objects, and Restall 2003,\nfor lacking a precise and coherent formulation of the plenitude\nprinciple on which the view is based. Martin (2001) proposes that\ndifferent universes of sets be amalgamated to yield a single maximal\nuniverse, which will be privileged by fitting our conception of set\nbetter than any other universe of sets. \n\nA different version of plenitudinous platonism is developed in Linsky\n& Zalta 1995 and a series of further articles. (See, for instance,\nLinsky & Zalta 2006 and other articles cited therein.)\nTraditional platonism goes wrong by “conceiv[ing] of abstract\nobjects on the model of physical objects” (Linsky & Zalta\n1995, p. 533), including in particular the idea that such objects are\n“sparse” rather than plenitudinous. Linsky & Zalta\ndevelop an alternative approach on the basis of the second author’s\n“object theory”. The main feature of object theory is a\nvery general comprehension principle which asserts the existence of a\nplenitude of abstract objects: for any collection of properties, there\nis an abstract object which “encodes” precisely these\nproperties. In object theory, moreover, two abstract objects are\nidentical just in case they encode precisely the same properties.\nObject theory’s comprehension principle and identity criterion are\nsaid to “provide the link between our cognitive faculty of\nunderstanding and abstract objects” (ibid.,\np. 547). (See Ebert & Rossberg 2007 for critical discussion.) \n\nAssume that object realism is true. For convenience, assume also\nClassical Semantics. These assumptions ensure that the singular\nterms and quantifiers of mathematical language refer to and range over\nabstract objects. Given these assumptions, should one also be a\nmathematical platonist? In other words, do the objects that mathematical\nsentences refer to and quantify over satisfy Independence or\nsome similar condition? \n\nIt will be useful to restate our assumptions in more neutral terms.\nWe can do this by invoking the notion of a semantic value,\nwhich plays an important role in semantics and the philosophy of\nlanguage. In these fields it is widely assumed that each expression\nmakes some definite contribution to the truth-value of sentences in\nwhich the expression occurs. This contribution is known as the\nsemantic value of the expression. It is widely assumed that\n(at least in extensional contexts) the semantic value of a singular\nterm is just its referent. \n\nOur assumptions can now be stated neutrally as the claim that\nmathematical singular terms have abstract semantic values and that its\nquantifiers range over the kinds of item that serve as semantic values.\nLet’s focus on the claim about singular terms. What is the\nphilosophical significance of this claim? In particular, does it\nsupport some version of Independence? The answer will depend on what is\nrequired for a mathematical singular term to have a semantic value. \n\nSome philosophers argue that not very much is required (Frege 1953,\nDummett 1981, Dummett 1991a, Wright 1983, Hale & Wright 2000, Rayo\n2013, and Linnebo 2012 and 2018). It suffices for the term t\nto make some definite contribution to the truth-values of sentences in\nwhich it occurs. The whole purpose of the notion of a semantic value\nwas to represent such contributions. It therefore suffices for a\nsingular term to possess a semantic value that it makes some such\nsuitable contribution. \n\nThis may even open the way for a form of non-eliminative reductionism\nabout mathematical objects (Dummett 1991a, Linnebo 2018). Although it\nis perfectly true that the mathematical singular term t has\nan abstract object as its semantic value, this truth may obtain in\nvirtue of more basic facts which do not mention or involve the\nrelevant abstract object. Compare for instance the relation of\nownership that obtains between a person and her bank account.\nAlthough it is perfectly true that the person owns the bank account,\nthis truth may obtain in virtue of more basic sociological or\npsychological facts which do not mention or involve the bank\naccount. \n\nIf some lightweight account of semantic values is defensible, we can\naccept the assumptions of object realism and Classical Semantics\nwithout committing ourselves to any traditional or robust form of\nplatonism. \n \nWe conclude by describing two further examples of lightweight forms of\nobject realism that reject the platonistic analogy between\nmathematical objects and ordinary physical objects. \n\nFirst, perhaps mathematical objects exist only in a potential manner,\nwhich contrasts with the actual mode of existence of ordinary physical\nobjects. This idea is at the heart of the ancient notion of potential\ninfinity (Lear 1980, Linnebo & Shapiro 2017). According to\nAristotle, the natural numbers are potentially infinite in the\nsense that, however large a number we have produced (by instantiating\nit in the physical world), it is possible to produce an even larger\nnumber. But Aristotle denies that the natural numbers\nare actually infinite: this would require the physical world to\nbe infinite, which he argues is impossible.  \n\nFollowing Cantor, most mathematicians and philosophers now defend the\nactual infinity of the natural numbers. This is made possible in part\nby denying the Aristotelian requirement that every number needs to be\ninstantiated in the physical world. When this is denied, the actual\ninfinity of the natural numbers no longer entails the actual infinity\nof the physical world.  \n\nHowever, a form of potentialism about the hierarchy of sets continues\nto enjoy considerable support, especially in connection with the\niterative conception of sets (Parsons 1977, Jané 2010, Linnebo 2013,\nStudd 2013). No matter how many sets have been formed, it is possible\nto form even more. If true, this would mean that sets have a potential\nform of existence which distinguishes them sharply from ordinary\nphysical objects.  \n\nSecond, perhaps mathematical objects are ontologically dependent or\nderivative in a way that distinguishes them from independently\nexisting physical objects (Rosen 2011, Donaldson 2017). For example,\non the Aristotelian view just mentioned, a natural number depends for\nits existence on some instantiation or other in the physical\nworld. There are other versions of the view as well. For example, Kit\nFine (1995) and others argue that a set is ontologically dependent on\nits elements. (This view is also closely related to the set-theoretic\npotentialism mentioned above.)
