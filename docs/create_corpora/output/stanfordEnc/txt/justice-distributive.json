These frameworks are the result of human political processes\nand they constantly change both across societies and within societies\nover time. The structure of these frameworks is important because the\ndistributions of benefits and burdens resulting from them\nfundamentally affect people’s lives. Arguments about which\nframeworks and/or resulting distributions are morally preferable\nconstitute the topic of distributive justice. Principles of\ndistributive justice are therefore best thought of as providing moral\nguidance for the political processes and structures that affect the\ndistribution of benefits and burdens in societies, and any principles\nwhich do offer this kind of moral guidance on distribution, regardless\nof the terminology they employ, should be considered principles of\ndistributive justice.\n\n\nThis entry is structured in the following way. After outlining the\nscope of the entry and the role of distributive principles, the first\nrelatively simple principle of distributive justice examined is Strict\nEgalitarianism, which calls for the allocation of equal material goods\nto all members of society. John Rawls’ alternative distributive\nprinciple, which he calls the Difference Principle, is examined next.\nThe Difference Principle permits diverging from strict equality so\nlong as the inequalities in question would make the least advantaged\nin society materially better off than they would be under strict\nequality. Some have thought that neither strict equality nor\nRawls’ Difference Principle capture the important moral roles of\nluck and responsibility. The “Luck Egalitarianism”\nliterature comprises varying attempts to design distributive\nprinciples that are appropriately sensitive to considerations of\nresponsibility and luck. Desert-based principles similarly emphasize\nthe moral roles of responsibility and luck but are distinct because\nthey approach these factors through claims about what people deserve\nbecause of their work.\n\n\nAdvocates of welfare-based principles (of which utilitarianism is the\nmost famous) do not believe the primary distributive concern should be\nmaterial goods and services. They argue that material goods and\nservices have no intrinsic value but are valuable only in so far as\nthey increase welfare. Hence, they argue, distributive principles\nshould be designed and assessed according to how they affect welfare,\neither its maximization or distribution. Advocates of libertarian\nprinciples, by contrast to each of the principles so far mentioned,\ngenerally criticize any distributive ideal that requires the pursuit\nof specific ‘patterns’, such as maximization or equality\nof welfare or of material goods. They argue that the pursuit of such\npatterns conflicts with the more important moral demands of liberty or\nself-ownership. Finally, feminist critiques of existing distributive\nprinciples note that they tend to ignore the particular circumstances\nof women, so feminists tend to argue for principles which are more\nsensitive to facts such as that women often have primary\nresponsibility for child-rearing and on average, spend less of their\nlifetimes than men in the market economy. \n\nDistributive principles vary in numerous dimensions. They vary in what\nis considered relevant to distributive justice (income, wealth,\nopportunities, jobs, welfare, utility, etc.); in the nature of the\nrecipients of the distribution (individual persons, groups of persons,\nreference classes, etc.); and on what basis the distribution should be\nmade (equality, maximization, according to individual characteristics,\naccording to free transactions, etc.). In this entry, the focus is\nprimarily on principles designed to cover the distribution of benefits\nand burdens of economic activity among individuals in a society.\nAlthough principles of this kind have been the dominant source of\nAnglo-American debate about distributive justice over the last six\ndecades, there are other important distributive justice questions,\nsome of which are covered by other entries in the encyclopedia. These\ninclude questions of distributive justice at the global level rather\nthan just at the national level (see\n justice: international),\n distributive justice across generations (see\n justice: intergenerational)\n and how the topic of distributive justice can be approached, not as a\nset of principles but as a virtue (see\n justice: as a virtue). \nAlthough the numerous distributive principles vary along different\ndimensions, for simplicity, they are presented here in broad\ncategories. Even though these are common classifications in the\nliterature, it is important to keep in mind they necessarily involve\nover-simplification, particularly with respect to the criticisms of\neach of the groups of principles. Some criticisms may not apply\nequally to every principle in the group. The issue of how we are to\nunderstand and respond to criticisms of distributive principles is\ndiscussed briefly in the final section on methodology (see\n Methodology). \nThroughout most of history, people were born into, and largely stayed\nin, a fairly rigid economic position. The distribution of economic\nbenefits and burdens was normally seen as fixed, either by nature or\nby a deity. Only when there was a widespread realization that the\ndistribution of economic benefits and burdens could be affected by\ngovernment did distributive justice become a live topic. Now the topic\nis unavoidable. Governments continuously make and change laws and\npolicies affecting the distribution of economic benefits and burdens\nin their societies. Almost all changes, whether they regard tax,\nindustry, education, health, etc. have distributive effects. As a\nresult, every society has a different distribution at any point in\ntime and we are becoming increasingly more adept at measuring that\ndistribution. More importantly, at every point in time now, each\nsociety is faced with a choice about whether to stay with current\nlaws, policies, etc. or to modify them. The practical contribution of\ndistributive justice theory is to provide moral guidance for these\nconstant choices. \nMany writers on distributive justice have tended to advocate and\ndefend their particular principles by describing or considering ideal\nsocieties operating under them. They have been motivated to do this as\nan aid to understanding what their principles mean. Unfortunately\nthough, as a result of this practice, some readers and the general\npublic have been misled into believing that discussions of\ndistributive justice are merely exercises in ideal theory—to\nbe dismissed as a past-time of the academic elite rather than as\nsomething that is crucially relevant to current political discussion.\nThis misunderstanding is unfortunate because, in the end, the main\npurpose of distributive justice theory is not to inform decisions\nabout ideal societies but about our societies. To help correct this\nmisunderstanding it is important to acknowledge that there has never\nbeen, and never will be, a purely libertarian society or Rawlsian\nsociety, or any society whose distribution conforms to one of the\nproposed principles. Rather than guiding choices between ideal\nsocieties, distributive principles are most usefully thought of as\nproviding moral guidance for the choices that each society faces right\nnow. So, for instance, advocates of Rawls’ Difference Principle\nare most constructively understood as arguing for changes to our basic\ninstitutional structures which would improve the lifetime prospects of\nthe least advantaged in society. Other theorists are arguing for\nchanges to bring economic benefits and burdens more in accordance with\nwhat people really deserve. Libertarians are arguing that reductions\nin government intervention in the economy will better respect liberty\nand/or self-ownership of its citizens. Sometimes a number of the\ntheories may recommend the same changes to our current practices;\nother times they will diverge. It is best to understand the different\ntheorists, despite the theoretical devices they sometimes employ, to\nbe speaking to what should be done in our society—not about\nwhat should be done in some hypothetical society. Of course, ensuring\nthat philosophical principles be effective for the purpose of guiding\npolicy and change in real societies involves important and complex\nmethodological questions. For a review of work specifically addressing\nthis issue, in ideal and nonideal theory, see Zofia Stemplowska and\nAdam Swift (2012), and Valentini (2012). \nDistributive justice theorists (perhaps like all theorists) tend to\nemphasize the differences between their theories. This emphasis also\nprovides an avenue for those who have an interest in ignoring\ndistributive justice to dismiss the relevance of the distributive\njustice literature—‘we cannot get any guidance from\nthese theorists—they completely disagree with each\nother’. Such dismissals misunderstand that it is impossible not\nto take a stand on distributive justice at every moment of a\nsociety’s existence. This misunderstanding is, perhaps, best\nillustrated by the most common type of dismissal. Often governments\ntry to justify inaction, in the face of calls to change some\ngovernment policy in light of some distributive justice concern, on\nthe grounds that there are ‘disagreements/lack of\nconsensus’ about the issue. Of course, there always are\ndisagreements, on any topic, whether moral or empirical, which will\nhave a differential effect on people’s material interests. But\nto think that this points to the desired conclusion—that in\nlight of this we should retain the status quo for the time \nbeing—reveals a confusion about the nature of the choices always\nfacing each society. So, in this instance, to claim that we should not\npursue any changes to our economic structures in light of a\ndistributive justice argument calling for change is, by its very\nnature, to take a stand on the distributive justice of (or, if one\nprefers, the morality of) the current distribution and structures in\nthe society compared to any of the possible alternative distributions\nand structures practically available. At any particular moment the\nexisting economic and institutional framework is influencing the\ncurrent distribution of economic and life prospects for all members of\nthe society. To assert that we should not change the current system is\ntherefore, despite implications to the contrary, to take a substantive\nposition on distributive justice debates. It is to argue that keeping\nthe existing distribution is morally preferable to changing to any\npractical alternative proposed—to take a substantive position\nin just the area that it was claimed was too controversial to\nconsider. Societies cannot avoid taking positions about distributive\njustice all the time and any suggestion that they can should be\nresisted as incoherent. \nA related point can be made when people assert that economic\nstructures and policy should be left to economists, or when people\nassert that economic policy can be pursued without reference to\ndistributive justice. These assertions reveal misconceptions about\nwhat distributive justice and economics are, and how they are related.\nPositive economics, at its best, can tell us about economic causes and\neffects. Positive economics is very important for distributive justice\nbecause it can give us guidance about which changes to pursue in order\nto better instantiate our moral principles. What it cannot do, in the\nabsence of the principles, is tell us what we should do. This point is\neasily lost in everyday political discussion. When an economist says\n‘The Central Bank should raise interest rates’, the\ngeneral population often, mistakenly, believes the recommendation is\npurely coming from the science of economics. Moreover the\n‘should’ is almost always a moral ‘should’.\nWhen economists make such a recommendation they, sometimes\nunconsciously, have taken off their social scientific hat. They are\nemploying alongside their positive economic theory, a moral principle.\nSuppressing, either consciously or unconsciously, that there are\nalways moral arguments being employed in arguments about what economic\npolicies a government should pursue has had the effect of creating\nmisconceptions about the respective roles of positive economics and\ndistributive justice in government decision-making. \nFor instance, the raising of interest rates is typically thought by\neconomists to have the dual effects of suppressing inflation and\nsuppressing employment. To get to a recommendation that the Central\nBank should reduce interest rates involves not only empirical views\nabout the relative sizes of the inflation and unemployment effects and\ntheir long-term impact on growth, etc. but also normative views about\nthe relative moral importance of inflation, employment and growth. For\neconomists, these normative views on economic policies come under the\nrubric of ‘normative’ economics, while philosophers would\ntypically categorize them under ‘distributive justice’.\nBut the rubrics are not important as basically the same area is\ncovered under different names—the normative evaluation of\neconomic policies, structures, or institutions. (To avoid confusion it\nshould be noted that the distributive justice tradition includes\nprinciples which do not use ‘justice’ per se, such as\nutilitarianism, but which are moral principles relating to\ndistribution just the same.) The evaluations often look different\nbecause economists most commonly use utility as their fundamental\nmoral concept while philosophers use a wider variety of moral\nconcepts, but the task in which they are both engaged is very similar.\nWhat is most important to understand here is that positive economics\nalone cannot, without the guidance of normative principles, recommend\nwhich policies, structures, or institutions to pursue. Distributive\njustice theories, such as those discussed in this entry, aim to supply\nthis kind of normative guidance.  \nOne of the simplest principles of distributive justice is that of\nstrict, or radical, equality. The principle says that every person\nshould have the same level of material goods (including burdens) and\nservices. The principle is most commonly justified on the grounds that\npeople are morally equal and that equality in material goods and\nservices is the best way to give effect to this moral ideal.  \nEven with this ostensibly simple principle, some of the difficult\nspecification problems of distributive principles can be seen. The two\nmain problems are the construction of appropriate indices for\nmeasurement (the index problem), and the specification of time frames.\nBecause there are numerous proposed solutions to these problems, the\n‘principle of strict equality’ is not a single principle\nbut a name for a group of closely related principles. This range of\npossible specifications occurs with all the common principles of\ndistributive justice. \nThe index problem arises primarily because the goods and services to\nbe distributed need to be measured if they are going to be distributed\naccording to some pattern (such as equality). The strict equality\nprinciple stated above says that there should be ‘the same\nlevel of material goods and services’. The problem is\nhow to specify and measure levels. The simplest way of solving the\nindex problem in the strict equality case is to specify that everyone\nshould have the same bundle of material goods and services\nrather than the same level (so everyone would have 4 oranges,\n6 apples, 1 bike, etc.). The problem with adopting this simple\nsolution is that there will be many other allocations of material\ngoods and services which will make some people better off without\nmaking anybody else worse off. Such allocations are what are called\n‘Pareto superior’ allocations (see\n equality\n for a more detailed discussion of Pareto efficiency). For instance,\nsomeone who prefers apples to oranges will be better off if she swaps\nsome of her oranges for some of the apples belonging to a person who\nprefers oranges. That way, they are both better off and no one is\nworse off. Indeed, since most everyone will wish to trade something,\nrequiring identical equal bundles will make virtually everybody worse\noff than they would be under an alternative allocation. So specifying\nthat everybody must have the same bundle of goods does not\nseem to be a satisfactory way of solving the index problem. Some index\nfor measuring the value of goods and services is required. \nMoney is an index for the value of material goods and services. It is\nan imperfect index whose pitfalls are documented in most economics\ntextbooks. Moreover, once the goods to be allocated are extended\nbeyond material ones to include goods such as opportunities, money\nmust be combined with other indices. (For instance, John Rawls’\nindex of primary goods—see Rawls 1971.) Nevertheless, using\nmoney, either in the form of income or wealth or both, as an index for\nthe value of material goods and services is the most common response\nto the index problem. In terms of public, rather than academic\ndiscourse, GDP (gross domestic product) or per capita GDP is most\ncommonly touted as the way to measure the effect of governments’\npolicies on the population’s well-being. The deficiencies in\nsuch indices has now been well-documented and has lead to the\nproposing of better alternative indices such as the Human Development\nIndex (HDI) and Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI).\nUnfortunately, the general population is generally unaware of these\nmore accurate indices and so are disadvantaged in their ability to\njudge the distributive justice effects of their governments’\npolicies.  \nThe second main specification problem involves time frames. Many\ndistributive principles identify and require that a particular pattern\nof distribution be achieved or at least be pursued as the objective of\ndistributive justice. But they also need to specify when the\npattern is required. One version of the principle of strict equality\nrequires that all people should have the same wealth at some initial\npoint, after which people are free to use their wealth in whatever way\nthey choose, with the consequence that future outcomes are bound to be\nunequal. Principles specifying initial distributions after which the\npattern need not be preserved are commonly called\n‘starting-gate’ principles. (See Ackerman 1980,\n53–59,168–170,180–186; Alstott and Ackerman\n1999.) \nBecause ‘starting-gate’ principles may eventually lead to\nlarge inequalities, strict egalitarians do not usually favor them. The\nmost common form of strict equality principle specifies that\nincome (measured in terms of money) should be equal in\neach time-frame, though even this may lead to significant\ndisparities in wealth if variations in savings are permitted. Hence,\nstrict equality principles are commonly conjoined with some\nsociety-wide specification of just saving behavior (see\n justice: intergenerational).\n In practice, however, this principle and the starting-gate version\nmight require more similar distributions than it first appears. This\nis because the structure of the family means the requirement to give\npeople equal starts will often necessitate redistribution to parents,\nwho due to bad luck, bad management, or simply their own choices, have\nbeen unsuccessful in accruing or holding on to material goods. \nThere are a number of direct moral criticisms made of strict equality\nprinciples: that they unduly restrict freedom, that they do not give\nbest effect to the moral equality of persons, that they conflict with\nwhat people deserve, etc. (see the sections on\n Libertarian Principles,\n and\n Desert-Based Principles,\n and the entry on\n equality).\n But the most common criticism is a welfare-based one related to the\nPareto efficiency requirement: that everyone can be materially better\noff if incomes are not strictly equal (Carens 1981). It is this\ncriticism which partly inspired the Difference Principle. \nThe wealth of an economy is not a fixed amount from one period to the\nnext, but can be influenced by many factors relevant to economic\ngrowth. These include, for example, technological advancement or\nchanges in policy that affect how much people are able to produce with\ntheir labour and resources. More wealth can be produced and indeed\nthis has been the overwhelming feature of industrialized countries\nover the last couple of centuries. The dominant economic view is that\nwealth is most readily increased in systems where those who are more\nproductive earn greater incomes. This economic view partly inspired\nthe formulation of the Difference Principle.  \nThe most widely discussed theory of distributive justice in the past\nfour decades has been that proposed by John Rawls in A Theory of\nJustice, (Rawls 1971), and Political Liberalism, (Rawls\n1993). Rawls proposes the following two principles of justice: \n1. Each person has an equal claim to a fully adequate scheme of equal\nbasic rights and liberties, which scheme is compatible with the same\nscheme for all; and in this scheme the equal political liberties, and\nonly those liberties, are to be guaranteed their fair value.  \n2. Social and economic inequalities are to satisfy two conditions: (a)\nThey are to be attached to positions and offices open to all under\nconditions of fair equality of opportunity; and (b), they are to be to\nthe greatest benefit of the least advantaged members of society.\n(Rawls 1993, pp. 5–6. The principles are numbered as they were\nin Rawls’ original A Theory of Justice.) \nWhere the rules may conflict in practice, Rawls says that Principle\n(1) has lexical priority over Principle (2), and Principle (2a) has\nlexical priority over (2b). As a consequence of the priority rules,\nRawls’ principles do not permit sacrifices to basic liberties in\norder to generate greater equality of opportunity or a higher level of\nmaterial goods, even for the worst off. While it is possible to think\nof Principle (1) as governing the distribution of liberties, it is not\ncommonly considered a principle of distributive justice given that it\nis not governing the distribution of economic goods per se.\nEquality of opportunity is discussed in the next section. In this\nsection, the primary focus will be on (2b), known as the Difference\nPrinciple.  \nThe main moral motivation for the Difference Principle is similar to\nthat for strict equality: equal respect for persons. Indeed, since the\nonly material inequalities the Difference Principle permits are those\nthat raise the level of the least advantaged in the society, it\nmaterially collapses to a form of strict equality under empirical\nconditions where differences in income have no effect on the work\nincentive of people (and hence, no tendency to increase growth). The\noverwhelming economic opinion though is that in the foreseeable future\nthe possibility of earning greater income will bring forth greater\nproductive effort. This will increase the total wealth of the economy\nand, under the Difference Principle, the wealth of the least\nadvantaged. Opinion divides on the size of the inequalities which\nwould, as a matter of empirical fact, be allowed by the Difference\nPrinciple, and on how much better off the least advantaged would be\nunder the Difference Principle than under a strict equality principle.\nRawls’ principle, however, gives fairly clear guidance on what\ntype of arguments will count as justifications for inequality. Rawls\nis not opposed in principle to a system of strict equality per\nse; his concern is about the absolute position of the\nleast advantaged group rather than their relative position.\nIf a system of strict equality maximizes the absolute position of the\nleast advantaged in society, then the Difference Principle advocates\nstrict equality. If it is possible to raise the absolute position of\nthe least advantaged further by having some inequalities of income and\nwealth, then the Difference Principle prescribes inequality up to that\npoint where the absolute position of the least advantaged can no\nlonger be raised. \nBecause there has been such extensive discussion of the Difference\nPrinciple in the last 40 years, there have been numerous criticisms of\nit from the perspectives of all the other theories of distributive\njustice outlined here. Briefly, the main criticisms are as\nfollows. \nAdvocates of strict equality argue that inequalities permitted by the\nDifference Principle are unacceptable even if they do benefit the\nabsolute position of the least advantaged. The problem for these\nadvocates has been to explain convincingly why society should be\nprevented from materially benefiting the least advantaged when this\nbenefit requires a deviation from strict equality. \nFor the strict egalitarian the relative position of people is\nall important and the absolute position is either not\nimportant at all or lexically inferior. For Rawls, at least with\nrespect to the social and economic inequalities, the opposite is true.\nBut there have been various plausible explanations given in reply to\nRawls’ proposed Difference Principle why relative position is a\nvalue that should be weighed against the value of the\nabsolute position of the least advantaged rather than subordinated\nlexically to it. In an early reply to Rawls, Crocker explains the\nvalue of paying attention to the relative position as a way of\nunderstanding the value of solidarity. His approach fits into a set of\nviews in which being materially equal, or striving towards it, is an\nimportant expression of the equality of persons. \nAnother set of views, in opposition to Rawls’ Difference\nPrinciple, emphasizes the importance of relative position not as a\nvalue in itself but because of its effect on other relations. In\nparticular, if some people are significantly better off materially\nthan others then that can result in them having significant power over\nothers. Rawls’ response to this criticism appeals to the lexical\npriority of his first principle: The inequalities consistent with the\nDifference Principle are only permitted so long as they do not\ncompromise the fair value of the political liberties. So, for\ninstance, very large wealth differentials may make it practically\nimpossible for poor people to be elected to political office or to\nhave their political views represented. These inequalities of wealth,\neven if they increase the material position of the least advantaged\ngroup, may need to be reduced in order for the first principle to be\nimplemented. However, while this provides a partial reply to\nRawls’ critics, it does not seem to recognize that it is not\njust differential political power that can come from significant\ndifferences in economic position but also economic power and hence\neconomic freedom. Virtual monopoly employers in regions of developing\neconomies give a stark illustration of this phenomenon. Of course,\nRawls can appeal in such cases to the empirical claim that such\ndifferentials do not maximize the long-term position of the least\nadvantaged. The empirical question will be whether all such large\ndifferentials which result in large differences in economic power also\ndemonstrably have the result of worsening the absolute position of the\nleast advantaged. \nThe utilitarian objection to the Difference Principle is that it does\nnot maximize utility. In A Theory of Justice, Rawls uses\nutilitarianism as the main theory for comparison with his own, and\nhence he offers a number of arguments in response to this utilitarian\nobjection, some of which are outlined in the section on\n Welfare-Based Principles. \nLibertarians object that the Difference Principle involves\nunacceptable infringements on liberty, property rights, or\nself-ownership. For instance, the Difference Principle may require\nredistributive taxation for the benefit of the poor, and libertarians\ncommonly object that such taxation involves the immoral taking of just\nholdings (see\n Libertarian Principles). \nThe Difference Principle is also criticized as a primary distributive\nprinciple on the grounds that it mostly ignores claims that people\ndeserve certain economic benefits in light of their actions.\nAdvocates of desert-based principles argue that some may deserve a\nhigher level of material goods because of their hard work or\ncontributions even if their unequal rewards do not also function to\nimprove the position of the least advantaged. Desert theorists as well\nas libertarians also argue that the explanation of how people\ncome to be in more or less advantaged positions is morally relevant to\ntheir fairness, yet the Difference Principle ignores these\nexplanations. \nLike desert theorists, advocates of Luck Egalitarian principles argue\nthat the Difference Principle does not fully capture the moral roles\nthey believe luck and responsibility should play in principles of\ndistributive justice. Indeed, ‘luck egalitarianism’ as a\ndistinct approach in the distributive justice literature really\ndeveloped in critical response to Rawls’ theory of distributive\njustice. The reasons for that response are outlined in the next\nsection. \nThe distribution of material goods and services is not the only\neconomic distribution which is important to people. The distribution\nof opportunities is also important. As noted in the previous section,\nJohn Rawls conjoined his Difference Principle with a principle of\nequality of opportunity. Endorsement of some form of equality of\nopportunity is very prevalent among distributive justice theorists\nand, indeed, among the general population, especially when combined\nwith some form of market distributive mechanism. Equality of\nopportunity is often contrasted favorably with ‘equality of\noutcome’ or strict egalitarianism, by those who believe that we\ncan show equal concern, respect, or treatment of people without them\nhaving the same material goods and services, so long as they have\nequal economic opportunities. An equality of opportunity principle\nthen, is combined with other principles to ensure that the\ninequalities permitted by the overall theory (whether utilitarian,\ndesert, or a Rawlsian difference principle) are only justified if\npeople have the relevant kind of equal opportunity to achieve greater\nor lesser amounts of goods. So an equality of opportunity principle\nallows those theorists who depart from strict equality to capture some\nof what nonetheless has motivated egalitarians. What is the morally\nbest interpretation of this equality of opportunity principle has been\na significant focus of research (see\n Equality of Opportunity),\n particularly among luck egalitarians. In fact, the luck egalitarian\nideal (also sometimes known as the ‘level playing field’\nideal) elevates the role of equal opportunity to the central\ndistributive ideal, so that distributive inequalities are only just\nwhen they flow from one’s choices or from factors for which one\ncan reasonably be held responsible. \nIn 1988, Brian Barry gave an interesting reconstruction of the\nreasoning which led John Rawls to his Equal Opportunity and Difference\nPrinciples. Barry’s reconstruction and Ronald Dworkin’s\nearlier discussion (which we will come to later), have been seminal in\nthe rise of the luck egalitarian literature; hence, a version of this\nargument is probably the best introduction to some of the relevant\nmoral issues. \n‘Formal’ equality of opportunity rules out formal\ndiscrimination on grounds such as a person’s race, ethnicity,\nage or gender. What is the underlying concern, shared by most\ntheorists and the general population, with a society lacking formal\nequality of opportunity? The concern seems to be rooted in the belief\nthat traits such as a persons’ gender or race are elements over\nwhich people have no control and, hence, a society in which\npeople’s race or gender have fundamental effects on their\nlifetime economic prospects treats people unfairly. In such societies,\nwhether people were born as the favored gender or race, and hence were\nfavored economically, would simply be a matter of luck. Rawls’\nclaim is that structuring a society so that this ‘natural\nlottery’ has such fundamental effects on people’s lives is\nimmoral, when we have the option to structure it another way, with a\nsystem of formal equality of opportunity.  \nThe foregoing is relatively uncontroversial, but what made\nRawls’ (and Barry’s) arguments so interesting was their\nclaim that this line of reasoning actually leads to much stronger (and\nmore contentious) requirements for social justice. They note that even\nwith formal equality of opportunity, there will remain many factors\nover which people have no control but which will affect their lifetime\neconomic prospects, such as whether a person’s family can afford\nto purchase good quality educational opportunities or health care. A\nsociety therefore will have reasons to adopt a more substantial\nequality of opportunity principle, with equal opportunities for\neducation, health care, etc.—the same reasons it had for\nadopting a merely formal equality of opportunity principle.  \nFollowing this line of reasoning further (and it certainly has\nappeared to many that we have no principled reason to stop here) seems\nto lead to more radical conclusions than those who agreed with formal\nequality of opportunity would have imagined. A society with a more\nsubstantial equality of opportunity principle in place will still not\nbe providing equality of opportunity for all. People are born into\nmore or less nurturing families and social circumstances. People are\nborn into families and neighborhoods which are more or less\nencouraging of education and the development of economically\nadvantageous talents. There are a whole range of social influences\nwhich have fundamental and unequal effects on children’s\neconomic prospects and for which they are in no way \nresponsible—the influences children are exposed to are a matter of their\nluck in the ‘social lottery’. Moreover, the luck of the\nnatural lottery is not just restricted to such characteristics as\ngender and race. Children are more or less fortunate in the\ndistribution of natural talents as well.  \nA race where the starting line is arbitrarily staggered, where\npeople’s prospects for winning are not largely determined by\nfactors for which they are responsible but rather largely by luck, is\nnot considered a fair race. Similarly, if society is structured so\nthat people’s prospects for gaining more economic goods are not\nlargely determined by factors for which they are responsible but\nrather largely by luck, then the society is open to the charge of\nbeing unfair. This is the challenging conclusion with which Barry,\nfollowing Rawls, presents us.  \nIn response to this challenge, Barry himself explores a number of\navenues, including questioning whether economic distribution is really\nanalogous to a race. Rawls, of course, responded to his own challenge\nby arguing that there is not a lot that can be done (morally) to make\nthe social and natural opportunities more equal, so the fair response\nis to adopt the Difference Principle. Others, however, have taken this\nchallenge in different directions. \nRonald Dworkin, (Dworkin 1981a, 1981b, 2000) provided one of the most\ndetailed early responses to Rawls’ challenge. In retrospect,\nDworkin’s theory is often identified as one of the earliest in\nthe luck egalitarian literature, though Dworkin himself called his\ntheory Resource Egalitarianism. Dworkin presented his key insight\n(i.e., what distinguishes him from Rawls) in terms of a distinction\nbetween ‘ambitions’ and ‘endowments’. Dworkin\nuses the term ‘ambitions’ to cover the realm of our\nchoices and what results from our choices, such as the choice to work\nhard, or to spend money on expensive luxuries. His term\n‘endowments’ refers to the results of brute luck, or those\nthings over which we have no control, such as one’s genetic\ninheritance, or unforeseeable bad luck. Dworkin agrees with Rawls that\nnatural inequalities are not distributed according to people’s\nchoices, nor are they justified by reference to some other morally\nrelevant fact about people, so people should not end up worse off as a\nresult of bad luck in the natural lottery. However, Dworkin argues the\nDifference Principle fails to deliver on this ideal, since its\nformulation in terms of primary goods fails to recognize that those\nwho are very unlucky, such as the severely ill or disabled, may need\nconsiderably greater shares of primary goods than others in order to\nachieve a reasonable life. Dworkin also argued that just economic\ndistributions should be more responsive than the Difference Principle\nto the consequences of people’s choices.  \nDworkin proposed that people begin with equal resources but be allowed\nto end up with unequal economic benefits as a result of their own\nchoices. What constitutes a just material distribution is to be\ndetermined by the result of a thought experiment designed to model\nfair distribution. Suppose that everyone is given the same purchasing\npower and each uses that purchasing power to bid, in a fair auction,\nfor resources best suited to their life plans. They are then permitted\nto use those resources as they see fit. Although people may end up\nwith different economic benefits, none of them is given less\nconsideration than another in the sense that if they wanted somebody\nelse’s resource bundle they could have bid for it instead. \nIn Dworkin’s proposal we see his attitudes to\n‘ambitions’ and ‘endowments’ which have become\na central feature of luck egalitarianism (though under a wide variety\nof alternative names and further subset-distinctions). In terms of\nsensitivity to ‘ambitions’, Dworkin and many other luck\negalitarians argue that provided people have an ‘equal’\nstarting point (in Dworkin’s case, resources) they should live\nwith the consequences of their choices. They argue, for instance, that\npeople who choose to work hard to earn more income should not be\nrequired to subsidize those choosing more leisure and hence less\nincome.  \nWith respect to ‘endowments’, Dworkin proposes a\nhypothetical compensation scheme in which he supposes that, before the\nhypothetical auction described above, people do not know their own\nnatural endowments. However, they are able to buy insurance against\nbeing disadvantaged in the natural distribution of talents and they\nknow that their payments will provide an insurance pool to compensate\nthose people who are unlucky in the ‘natural lottery’. \nDworkin’s early proposals were very hypothetical and it was\nsomewhat difficult to see what they meant in practice. Later luck\negalitarians have tried to tease out the practical implications of\ntheir theories in more detail, though much of the debate still remains\nat the theoretical level. They agree with Dworkin’s\nrecommendation, against Rawls’ Difference Principle approach,\nthat those with unequal natural endowments should receive\ncompensation. For instance, people born with disabilities, or\nill-health, who have not brought these circumstances upon themselves,\ncan be explicitly compensated so that they are not disadvantaged in\ntheir economic prospects. Under Rawls’ Difference Principle,\nthough, no such explicit compensation is forthcoming—as Rawls\nsays, the Difference Principle is not the principle of redress (Rawls\n1971, 101). Of course, for the subset of people with long-term\ndisabilities or ill-health who are also in the least advantaged group\n(variously defined by Rawls, but most commonly defined as the lowest\nsocio-economic grouping) the Difference Principle will help. But the\nhelp will not be proportionate to their needs arising from their\ndisabilities or ill-health. \nLuck egalitarians continue to refine such aspects of their theories as\n(a) what they believe is the relevant conception of equality of\nopportunity, (b) how much of a role luck should play in the\ndistribution of economic benefits and (c) what is the best conception\nof ‘luck’ (Arneson 1990 and 2001, Fleurbaey 2001, Hurley\n2001 and 2003, Swift 2008, Sher 2010). Relatedly, they continue to\nexplore what role responsibility should play in the distribution of\neconomic goods (Sen 1985, Cohen 1997, Valentyne 1997, Knight\n2011). \nBecause the luck egalitarian proposals have a similar motivation to\nthe Difference Principle the moral criticisms of them tend to be\nvariations on those leveled against the Difference Principle. However,\nas noted above, what is practically required of a society operating\nunder the Difference Principle is relatively straightforward. How the\ntheoretical concerns of luck egalitarians are to be practically\nimplemented is often not so clear. For instance, it has seemed\nimpossible to measure differences in people’s natural \ntalents—unfortunately, people’s talents do not neatly divide\ninto the natural and those for which people can be held responsible. A\nsystem of special assistance to the physically and mentally disabled\nand to the ill would be a partial implementation of the compensation\nsystem, but most natural inequalities would be left untouched by such\nassistance while the theories commonly require compensation for such\ninequalities. Exploring how in practical ways the economic systems can\nbe refined to track responsibility while mitigating certain types of\npure luck will be an ongoing challenge for luck egalitarians. \nWelfare-based principles are motivated by the idea that what is of\nprimary moral importance is the level of welfare of people. Advocates\nof welfare-based principles view the concerns of other \ntheories—material equality, the level of primary goods of the least\nadvantaged, resources, desert-claims, or liberty—as derivative\nconcerns. They are valuable only in so far as they affect welfare and\nso all distributive questions should be settled entirely by how the\ndistribution affects welfare. \nChoosing welfare as the relevant value is only the first step towards\nanswering the distributive questions. Welfare-theorists must also\nspecify the welfare function. The welfare functions proposed vary\naccording to what will count as welfare and the weighting system for\nthat welfare. Economists defending some form of welfarism normally\nstate the explicit functional form, while philosophers often omit this\nformality, concentrating on developing their theories in answer to two\nquestions: 1) the question of what has intrinsic value (‘what\ncounts as welfare’), and 2) the question of what actions or\npolicies would maximize the intrinsic value. Moreover, philosophers\nhave tended to focus on an extremely small subset of the available\nwelfare functions. Although there are a number of advocates of\nalternative welfare functions (such as ‘equality of\nwell-being’), most philosophical activity has concentrated on a\nvariant known as utilitarianism. This theory can be used to illustrate\nmost of the main characteristics of welfare-based principles. \nHistorically, utilitarians have used the term ‘utility’\nrather than ‘welfare’ and utility has been defined\nvariously as pleasure, happiness, or preference-satisfaction, etc.\nJeremy Bentham, the historical father of utilitarianism, argued that\nthe experience of pleasure was the only thing with intrinsic value,\nand all other things had instrumental value insofar as they contribute\nto the experience of pleasure or the avoidance of pain. His\nintellectual successor, John Stuart Mill, broadened this theory of\nintrinsic value to include happiness, or fulfillment. Modern\nphilosophers since Kenneth Arrow, though, tend to argue that intrinsic\nvalue consists in preference-satisfaction, i.e. in individuals’\nhaving what they want. So, for instance, the principle for\ndistributing economic benefits for preference utilitarians is to\ndistribute them so as to maximize preference-satisfaction. The welfare\nfunction for such a principle has a relatively simple theoretical form\nrequiring the distribution maximizing the arithmetic sum of all\nsatisfied preferences (unsatisfied preferences being negative),\nweighted for the intensity of those preferences. To accommodate\nuncertainty with respect to outcomes the function is modified so that\nexpected utility, rather than utility, is maximized (see\n consequentialism).\n  \nThe basic theory of utilitarianism is one of the simplest to state and\nunderstand. Much of the work on the theory therefore has been directed\ntowards defending it against moral criticisms, particularly from the\npoint of view of ‘commonsense’ morality. The criticisms\nand responses have been widely discussed in the literature on\nutilitarianism as a general moral theory (see\n consequentialism).\n Two of the most widely discussed criticisms will be mentioned\nhere. \nThe first, which was famously articulated by John Rawls (1971), is\nthat utilitarianism fails to take seriously the distinctness of\npersons. Maximization of preference-satisfaction is often taken as\nprudent in the case of individuals—people may take on greater\nburdens, suffering or sacrifice at certain periods of their lives so\nthat their lives are overall better. The complaint against\nutilitarianism is that it takes this principle, commonly described as\nprudent for individuals, and uses it on an entity, society, unlike\nindividuals in important ways. While it may be acceptable for a person\nto choose to suffer at some period in her life (be it a day, or a\nnumber of years) so that her overall life is better, it is often\nargued against utilitarianism that it is immoral to make some people\nsuffer so that there is a net gain for other people. In the individual\ncase, there is a single entity experiencing both the sacrifice and the\ngain. Also, the individuals, who suffer or make the sacrifices, choose\nto do so in order to gain some benefit they deem worth their\nsacrifice. In the case of society as a whole, there is no single\nexperiential entity—some people suffer or are sacrificed so\nthat others may gain. Furthermore, under utilitarianism, unlike the\nindividual prudence case, there is no requirement for people to\nconsent to the suffering or sacrifice, nor is there necessarily a\nunified belief in the society that the outcome is worth the cost. \nA related criticism of utilitarianism involves the way it treats\nindividual preferences about other peoples’ welfare or holdings.\nFor instance, some people may have a preference that the members of\nsome minority racial group have less material benefits. Under\nutilitarian theories, in their classical form, this preference or\ninterest counts like any other in determining the best distribution.\nHence, if racial preferences are widespread and are not outweighed by\nthe minority’s contrary preferences (perhaps because the\nminority is relatively few in number compared to the majority),\nutilitarianism will recommend an inegalitarian distribution based on\nrace if there is not some other utility-maximizing alternative on\noffer. \nUtilitarians have responded to these criticisms in a number of ways.\nOften they just deny the empirical claim upon which the criticism\nrests. So they assert that the empirical conditions are such that\nutility maximizing will rarely require racial minorities to sacrifice\nor suffer for the benefit of others, or to satisfy the prejudices of\nothers. Relatedly, utilitarians often emphasize the long run\nperspective required by their theory. They may concede that short-term\nmaximization may point to distribution on a racial basis but that this\nwould not be welfare-maximizing in the long run and that even greater\nwelfare can be achieved by re-educating the majority so that racist\npreferences weaken or disappear over time, leading to a more\nharmonious and happier world. In reply, it is pointed out that the\nutilitarian must supply an account of why racist or sexist preferences\nshould be discouraged if the same level of total long term utility\ncould be achieved by encouraging the less powerful to be content with\na lower position.  \nCritics of utilitarianism have responded that this reliance on the\nempirical conditions turning out a particular way undermines the\nplausibility of utilitarianism as a moral theory. They argue that we\ndo not have to wait until we find out how strong the racist feelings\nare, how many are in the adversely affected racial minority, how many\nracists there are, etc. to know that racist policies are wrong. It is\nargued that given utilitarianism says that we do need to know these\nnumbers in order to know when, if ever, racist policies are wrong,\nutilitarianism fails to adequately capture our moral judgments.\nUtilitarians respond that if their theory on rare occasions does\nrequire people to sacrifice or suffer in these or other ways, the\nunintuitiveness of this consequence is a result of our contrary moral\njudgments about right and wrong, which are fallible. For many\nutilitarians, commonsense moral judgments are best understood as\nproviding us with ‘rules of thumb’ which are useful at the\nlevel of commonsense morality but can ultimately be mistaken at the\nlevel of ‘critical theory’. \nMost recently, some utilitarians have drawn on institutional theory or\ngame theory in defence, or in modification, of utilitarianism (see\nHardin 1988, Goodin 1995, Bailey 1997). Noting that the consequences\nof individual actions are rarely determined in isolation, but rather\nin conjunction with the actions of many others, these\n‘institutional’ or ‘indirect’ utilitarians\nargue that morally intuitive institutions such as constitutional\nrights, human rights and various property rights would be endorsed by\nthis modified utilitarianism, and would forbid the morally horrible\noutcomes critics have feared utilitarianism could sanction. \nUtilitarian distribution principles, like the other principles\ndescribed here, have problems with specification and implementation.\nMost formulations of utilitarianism require interpersonal comparisons\nof utility. This means, for instance, that we must be able to compare\nthe utility one person gains from eating an apple with that another\ngains from eating an apple. Furthermore, utilitarianism requires that\ndifferences in utility be measured and summed for widely disparate\ngoods (so, for instance, the amount of utility a particular person\ngains from playing football is measured and compared with the amount\nof utility another gains from eating a gourmet meal). Some critics\nhave argued that such interpersonal utility comparisons are\nimpossible, even in theory, because even if all the diverse goods can\nbe combined into a single index of ‘utility’ for an\nindividual, there is no conceptually adequate way of calibrating such\na measure among individuals (see Elster 1991). \nUtilitarians face a greater problem than this theoretical one in\ndetermining what material distribution, or institutional structure, is\nprescribed by their theory. Those who share similar utilitarian\ntheoretical principles frequently recommend very different\ndistributions or structures to implement the principles. This problem\noccurs for other theories, with recommendations for distributions or\neconomic structures to implement commonly varying among advocates with\nsimilar theoretical principles. But the advocates for other\ndistributive principles tend to cluster significantly with respect to\nwhat they recommend. This is much less the case with respect to\nadvocates for utilitarian and welfare-based distribution principles\nwith advocates dispersed in their recommendations across the full\nrange of possible distributions and economic structures. For instance,\nmany preference utilitarians believe their principle prescribes\nstrongly egalitarian structures with lots of state intervention while\nother preference utilitarians believe it prescribes a laissez\nfaire style of capitalism. \nThere is an explanation for why utilitarianism seems so much less\ndeterminate in its policy (including structural) recommendations and\nit points to what is the greatest challenge to utilitarianism as a\nguiding distributive principle. Other distributive principles can rule\nout, relatively quickly, various policies on the grounds that they\nclearly violate the guiding principle, but utilitarians must examine,\nin great detail, all the policies on offer. For each policy, they must\ndetermine the distribution of goods and services yielded by the policy\nand at least three other factors: the identity of each person in the\ndistribution (if individuals’ utility functions differ); the\nutility of each person from the goods and services distributed to\nthem; the utility of each person from the policy itself. They must\nthen aggregate these utilities across all individuals. The size of the\ninformation requirements make this task impossible. Hence, broad\nassumptions must be made and each different set of assumptions will\nyield a different answer, and so the answers range across the full set\nof policies on offer. Moreover, there is no obvious way to arbitrate\nbetween the different sets of assumptions. For instance, suppose three\nutilitarians agree on the same utilitarian distributive principle.\nUtilitarian 1, for example, may assert that the population’s\nutility function conforms to function A (e.g. people’s marginal\nutility is diminishing at rate R) and is maximized by Policy 1;\nUtilitarian 2, however, asserts that half the population’s\nutility function conforms to function A and half to function B (e.g.\npeople’s marginal utility is diminishing at rate 2R) and is\nmaximized by Policy 2; Utilitarian 3 asserts Utilitarian 2 is correct\nabout the utility functions of the population but claims that Policy 3\nis the one that will maximize utility. The challenge for contemporary\nutilitarians is to explain, given the massive informational\nrequirements of utilitarianism and our apparent human inability to\nmeet those requirements, how the population, and its experts, can\nplausibly arbitrate between conflicting policy and institutional\nrecommendations coming from utilitarian theorists who share the same\nunderlying normative principle. \nAnother complaint against welfarism is that it ignores, and in fact\ncannot even make sense of, claims that people deserve certain\neconomic benefits in light of their actions (Feinberg, Lamont 1997).\nThe complaint is often motivated by the concern that various forms of\nwelfarism treat people as mere containers for well-being, rather than\npurposeful beings, responsible for their actions and creative in their\nenvironments.  \nThe various proposed\n desert-based\n principles of distribution differ primarily according to what they\nidentify as the basis for deserving. While Aristotle proposed virtue,\nor moral character, to be the best desert-basis for economic\ndistribution, contemporary desert theorists have proposed desert-bases\nthat are more practically implemented in complex modern societies.\nMost contemporary desert theorists have pursued John Locke’s\nlead in this respect. Locke argued people deserve to have those items\nproduced by their toil and industry, the products (or the value\nthereof) being a fitting reward for their effort (see Miller 1989).\nLocke’s underlying idea was to guarantee to individuals the\nfruits of their own labor and abstinence. Most contemporary proposals\nfor desert-bases fit into one of three broad categories: \nAccording to the contemporary desert theorist, people freely apply\ntheir abilities and talents, in varying degrees, to socially\nproductive work. People come to deserve varying levels of income by\nproviding goods and services desired by others (Feinberg 1970).\nDistributive systems are just insofar as they distribute incomes\naccording to the different levels earned or deserved by the\nindividuals in the society for their productive labors, efforts, or\ncontributions. \nContemporary desert-principles all share the value of raising the\nstandard of living—collectively, ‘the social\nproduct’. Under each principle, only activity directed at\nraising the social product will serve as a basis for deserving income.\nThe concept of desert itself does not yield this value of raising the\nsocial product; it is a value societies hold independently. Hence,\ndesert principles identifying desert-bases tied to socially productive\nactivity (productivity, compensation, and effort all being examples of\nsuch bases) do not do so because the concept of desert requires this.\nThey do so because societies value higher standards of living, and\ntherefore choose the raising of living standards as the primary value\nrelevant to desert-based distribution. This means that the full\ndevelopment of desert-based principles requires specification (and\ndefense) of those activities which will or will not count as socially\nproductive, and hence as deserving of remuneration (Lamont 1994). \nIt is important to distinguish desert-payments from entitlements. For\ndesert theorists a well-designed institutional structure will make it\nso that many of the entitlements people have are deserved. But\nentitlements and just deserts are not conceptually the same and\nregularly come apart. For instance, as Feinberg notes, a person can be\nentitled to assume the presidential office without deserving it\n(Feinberg 1970, 86) and a person who accidentally apprehends a\ncriminal may be entitled to a reward but not deserve it. Conversely, a\nteam may deserve to win the championship prize but not be entitled to\nit or a person may deserve an economic benefit but not be entitled to\nit. Indeed, these and many other instances of desert and entitlements\ncoming apart provide the bases for desert theorists to argue for\ninstitutional reform. For desert theorists, the institutional\nstructure should facilitate people’s economic entitlements\n(including one’s property holdings) tracking their just\ndeserts. \nPayments designed to give people incentives are a form of entitlement\nparticularly worth distinguishing from desert-payments as they are\ncommonly confused (Barry 1965, 111–112). Incentive-payments are\n‘forward-looking’ in that they are set up to create a\nsituation in the future, while desert-payments are\n‘backwards-looking’in that they are justified with\nreference to work in the present or past. Even though it is possible\nfor the same payment to be both deserved and an incentive, incentives\nand desert provide distinct rationales for income and should not be\nconflated (Lamont 1997). \nWhile some have sought to justify current capitalist distributions via\ndesert-based distributive principles, John Stuart Mill and many since\nhave forcefully argued the contrary claim—that the\nimplementation of a productivity principle would involve dramatic\nchanges in modern market economies and would greatly reduce the\ninequalities characteristic of them. It is important to note, though,\nthat contemporary desert-based principles are rarely complete\ndistributive principles. They usually are only designed to cover\ndistribution among working adults, leaving basic welfare needs to be\nmet by other principles. \nThe specification and implementation problems for desert-based\ndistribution principles revolve mainly around the desert-bases: it is\ndifficult to identify what is to count as a contribution, an effort or\na cost, and it is even more difficult to measure these in a complex\nmodern economy. \nThe main moral objection to desert-based principles is that they make\neconomic benefits depend on factors over which people have little\ncontrol. John Rawls has made one of the most widely discussed\narguments to this effect (Rawls 1971), and while a strong form of this\nargument has been clearly refuted (Zaitchik, Sher), it remains a\nproblem for desert-based principles. The problem is most pronounced in\nthe case of productivity-based principles—people’s\nproductivity seems clearly to be influenced by many factors over which\nthey have little control. \nIt is interesting to note that under most welfare-based principles, it\nis also the case that people’s level of economic benefits\ndepends on factors beyond their control. But welfarists view this as a\nvirtue of their theory, since they think the only morally relevant\ncharacteristic of any distribution is the welfare resulting from it.\nWhether the distribution ties economic benefits to matters beyond our\ncontrol is morally irrelevant from the welfarist point of view. (As it\nhappens, welfarists often hold the empirical claim that people have\nlittle control over their contributions to society anyway.) However,\nfor people’s benefits to depend on factors beyond their control\nis a more awkward result for desert theorists who, with luck\negalitarians, emphasize the responsibility of people in choosing to\nengage in more or less productive activities. \nMost contemporary versions of the principles discussed so far allow\nsome role for the market as a means of achieving the desired\ndistributive pattern—the Difference Principle uses it as a\nmeans of helping the least advantaged; utilitarian principles commonly\nuse it as a means of achieving the distributive pattern maximizing\nutility; desert-based principles rely on it to distribute goods\naccording to desert, etc. In contrast, advocates of libertarian\ndistributive principles rarely see the market as a means to some\ndesired pattern, since the principle(s) they advocate do not\nostensibly propose a ‘pattern’ at all, but instead\ndescribe the sorts of acquisitions or exchanges which are just in\ntheir own right. The market will be just, not as a means to some\npattern, but insofar as the exchanges permitted in the market satisfy\nthe conditions of just acquisition and exchange described by the\nprinciples. For libertarians, just outcomes are those arrived at by\nthe separate just actions of individuals; a particular distributive\npattern is not required for justice. Robert Nozick advanced this\nversion of libertarianism (Nozick 1974), and is its best known\ncontemporary advocate.  \nNozick proposes a 3-part “Entitlement Theory”. \nThe complete principle of distributive justice would say simply that a\ndistribution is just if everyone is entitled to the holdings they\npossess under the distribution (Nozick, p.151). \nThe statement of the Entitlement Theory includes reference to the\nprinciples of justice in acquisition and transfer. (For details of\nthese principles see Nozick, pp.149–182.) The principle of\njustice in transfer is the least controversial and is designed to\nspecify fair contracts while ruling out stealing, fraud, etc. The\nprinciple of justice in acquisition is more complicated and more\ncontroversial. The principle is meant to govern the gaining of\nexclusive property rights over the material world. For the\njustification of these rights, Nozick takes his inspiration from John\nLocke’s idea that everyone ‘owns’ themselves and, by\nmixing one’s labors with the world, self-ownership can generate\nownership of some part of the material world. However, of\nLocke’s mixing metaphor, Nozick legitimately asks:\n‘…why isn’t mixing what I own with what I\ndon’t own a way of losing what I own rather than a way of\ngaining what I don’t? If I own a can of tomato juice and spill\nit in the sea so its molecules... mingle evenly throughout the sea, do\nI thereby come to own the sea, or have I foolishly dissipated my\ntomato juice?’ (Nozick 1974, p.174) Nozick concludes that what\nis significant about mixing our labor with the material world is that\nin doing so, we tend to increase the value of it, so that\nself-ownership can lead to ownership of the external world in such\ncases (Nozick 1974, pp. 149–182). \nThe obvious objection to this claim is that it is not clear why the\nfirst people to acquire some part of the material world should be able\nto exclude others from it (and, for instance, be the land owners while\nthe later ones become the wage laborers). In response to this\nobjection, Nozick follows Locke in recognizing the need for a\nqualification on just acquisition. According to the Lockean\nProviso, an exclusive acquisition of the external world is just,\nif, after the acquisition, there is ‘enough and as good left in\ncommon for others’. One of the main challenges for libertarians\nhas been to formulate a morally plausible interpretation of this\nproviso. According to Nozick’s weaker version of Locke’s\nProviso, “a process normally giving rise to a permanent\nbequeathable property right in a previously unowned thing will not do\nso if the position of others no longer at liberty to use the thing is\nthereby worsened” (Nozick, 1974, p. 178). For Nozick’s\ncritics, his proviso is unacceptably weak. This is partly because it\nfails to consider the position others may have achieved under\nalternative distributions and thereby instantiates the morally dubious\ncriterion of whoever is first gets the exclusive spoils. For example,\none can satisfy Nozick’s proviso by ‘acquiring’ a\nbeach and charging $1 admission to those who previously were able to\nuse the beach for free, so long as one compensates them with a benefit\nthey deem equally valuable, such as a clean-up or life-guarding\nservice on the beach. However, the beach-goers would have been even\nbetter off had the more efficient organizer among them acquired the\nbeach, charging only 50 cents for the same service, but this\nalternative is never considered under Nozick’s proviso (Cohen,\n1995). \nWill Kymlicka has given a summary of the steps in Nozick’s\nself-ownership argument: \nThe assessment of this argument is quite complex, but the difficulties\nmentioned above with the proviso call into question claims (3) and\n(4). The challenge for libertarians then is to find a plausible\nreading of (3) which will yield (4). Moreover, Nozick extends the\noperation of the proviso to apply both to acquisitions and transfers,\ncompounding the problem (Nozick, 1974, p. 174). \nEgalitarian leaning theorists generally have opposed Nozick’s\nform of libertarianism on the grounds that its implementation would\nlead to potentially vast material inequalities. However, a subset of\negalitarians have nevertheless been attracted to the normative\nstrength and implications of self-ownership, concerned that an\nunconstrained pursuit of equality could pose a danger to\npeople’s rights over themselves and their labor. G.A. Cohen\neloquently expresses this concern: \nOf course, many existing holdings are the result of acquisitions or\ntransfers which at some point did not satisfy the principles of\njustice for acquisitions or transfers, however these are understood.\nHence, libertarians who rely on historical principles to underpin\nproperty rights must supplement these with a principle of\nrectification for past injustice, or at least some strategy for\ndealing with unjust holdings. Although Nozick does not specify this\nprinciple he does describe its purpose: \nNozick does not make an attempt to provide a principle of\nrectification. The absence of such a principle is much worse for a\nhistorical theory than for a patterned theory. Past injustices\nsystematically undermine the justice of every subsequent distribution\nin historical theories. Nozick is clear that his historical theory\ncannot be used to evaluate the justice of actual societies until such\na theory of rectification is given or no considerations of\nrectification of injustice could apply to justify the distribution in\nthe actual society:  \nUnfortunately for the theory, it would seem that no such treatment\nwill ever be forthcoming because the task is, for all practical\npurposes, impossible. The numbers of injustices perpetrated throughout\nhistory, both within nations and between them, are enormous and the\nnecessary details of the vast majority of injustices are unavailable.\nEven if the details of the injustices were available, the\ncounterfactual causal chains could not be reliably determined. As\nDerek Parfit has pointed out, in a different context, even the people\nwho would have been born would have been different (Parfit 1986). As a\nconsequence, it is difficult to see how Nozick’s entitlement\ntheory could provide guidance as to what the current distribution of\nmaterial holdings should be or what distributions or redistributions\nare legitimate or illegitimate. (Indeed Nozick suggests, for instance,\nthe Difference Principle may be the best implementation of the\nprinciple of rectification.) Although Nozick is fairly candid about\nthis consequence, many of his supporters and critics have ignored it\nand have carried on a vigorous debate as though, contrary to\nNozick’s own statement, his theory can be used to evaluate the\njustice of current economic distributions.  \nClassical libertarians such as Nozick usually advocate a system in\nwhich there are exclusive property rights, with the role of the\ngovernment restricted to the protection of these property rights. The\nproperty rights commonly rule out taxation for purposes other than\nraising the funds necessary to protect property rights. One of the\nstrongest critiques of any attempt to institute such a system of\nlegally protected strong property rights comes, as we have seen, from\nNozick’s theory itself—there seems no obvious reason to\ngive strong legal protection to property rights which have arisen\nthrough violations of the just principles of acquisition and transfer.\nBut putting this critique to one side for a moment, what other\narguments are made in favor of exclusionary property rights? \nAs already noted, Nozick argues that because people own themselves and\nhence their talents, they own whatever they can produce with these\ntalents. Moreover, it is possible in a free market to sell the\nproducts of exercising one’s talents. Any taxation of the income\nfrom such selling, according to Nozick, ‘institute[s] (partial)\nownership by others of people and their actions and labor’\n(Nozick, p. 172). People, according to this argument, have these\nexclusive rights of ownership. Taxation then, simply involves\nviolating these rights and allowing some people to own (partially)\nother people. Moreover, it is argued, any system not legally\nrecognizing these rights violates Immanuel Kant’s maxim to treat\npeople always as ends in themselves and never merely as a means. The\ntwo main difficulties with this argument have been: (1) to show that\nself-ownership is only compatible with having such strong exclusive\nproperty rights; and (2) that a system of exclusive property rights is\nthe best system for treating people with respect, as ends in\nthemselves. \nNozick candidly accepts that he does not himself give a systematic\nmoral justification of the exclusionary property rights he advocates:\n‘This book does not present a precise theory of the moral basis\nof individual rights.’ (Nozick, p.xiv) But others have tried to\nprovide more systematic justifications of similar rights (Lomasky,\nSteiner) or to develop, more fully, justifications to which Nozick\nalludes. \nIn addition to the arguments from self-ownership, and the requirement\nto treat people as ends in themselves, the most common other route for\ntrying to justify exclusive property rights has been to argue that\nthey are required for the maximization of freedom and/or liberty or\nthe minimization of violations of these (Hayek 1960). As an empirical\nclaim though, this appears to be false. If we compare countries with\nless exclusionary property rights (e.g. more taxation) with countries\nwith more exclusionary property regimes, we see no systematic\nadvantage in freedoms or liberties enjoyed by people in the latter\ncountries. (Of course, we do see a difference in distribution\nof such freedoms or liberties. In the latter countries, the richer\nhave more and the poorer less, while in the former they are more\nevenly distributed.) Now if libertarians restrict what counts as a\nvaluable freedom/liberty (and discount other freedoms/liberties people\nvalue), it will follow that exclusionary property rights are required\nto maximize freedom and/or liberty or to minimize violations of these.\nBut the challenge for these libertarians is to show why only their\nfavored liberties and freedoms are valuable, and not those which are\nweakened by a system of exclusive property rights. \nThere is no one feminist conception of distributive justice; feminists\ndefend positions across the political spectrum. Hence, feminists offer\ndistinctive versions of all the theories considered so far as well as\nothers. One way of thinking about what unifies many feminist theorists\nis an interest in what difference, if any, the practical experience of\ngender makes to the subject matter or study of justice; how different\nfeminists answer this question distinguishes them from each other and\nfrom those alternative distributive principles that most inspire their\nthinking. \nThe distributive principles so far outlined, with the exception of\nstrict egalitarianism, are often described as falling under the broad\nclassification of liberalism—they both inform, and are the\nproduct of, the liberal democracies which have emerged over the last\ntwo centuries. Lumping them together this way, though somewhat clumsy,\nmakes the task of understanding the emergence of feminist critiques\n(and the subsequent positive theories) much easier. \nJohn Stuart Mill in The Subjection of Women (1869) gives one\nof the clearest early feminist critiques of the political and\ndistributive structures of the emerging liberal democracies. His\nwritings provided the starting point for many contemporary liberal\nfeminists. Mill argued that the principles associated with the\ndeveloping liberalism of his time required equal political status for\nwomen. The principles Mill explicitly mentions include a rejection of\nthe aristocracy of birth, equal opportunity in education and in the\nmarketplace, equal rights to hold property, a rejection of the man as\nthe legal head of the household, and equal rights to political\nparticipation. Feminists inspired by Mill believe that a proper\nrecognition of the position of women in society requires that women be\ngiven equal and the same rights as men have, and that these primarily\nprotect their liberty and their status as equal persons under the law.\nThus, government regulation should not prevent women from competing on\nequal terms with men in educational, professional, marketplace and\npolitical institutions. The problem for women, on the liberal feminist\nview, is not liberalism but the failure of society and the State to\nproperly instantiate liberal principles. \nFrom the point of view of other feminisms, the liberal feminist\nposition is a conservative one, in the sense that it requires the\nproper inclusion for women of the rights, protections, and\nopportunities previously secured for men, rather than a fundamental\nchange from the traditional liberal position. One phrase or motto\naround which a whole range of feminists have rallied marks a\nsignificant break with Mill’s liberalism: ‘the personal is\npolitical.’ Feminists have offered a variety of interpretations\nof this motto, many of which take the form of a critique of liberal\ntheories. Mill was crucial in developing the liberal doctrine of\nlimiting the state’s intervention in the private lives of\ncitizens. Many contemporary feminists have argued that the resulting\nliberal theories of justice have fundamentally been unable to\naccommodate the injustices that have their origins in this\n‘protected’ private sphere. This particular feminist\ncritique has also been a primary source of inspiration for the broader\nmulticultural critique of liberalism. The liberal commitments to\ngovernment neutrality and to a protected personal sphere of liberty,\nwhere the government must not interfere, have been primary critical\ntargets. \nWhile issues about neutrality and personal liberty go beyond debates\nabout distributive justice they also have application within these\ndebates. The feminist critics recognize that liberalism correctly\nidentifies the government as one potential source of oppression\nagainst individuals, and therefore recommends powerful political\nprotections of individual liberty. They argue, however, that liberal\ntheories of distributive justice are unable to address the oppression\nwhich surfaces in the so-called private sphere of government\nnon-interference. Susan Moller Okin, for example, documents the\neffects of the institution of the nuclear family, arguing that the\nconsequence of this institution is a position of systematic material\nand political inequality for women. Standard liberal theories,\ncommitted to neutrality in the private sphere, seem powerless to\naddress (or sometimes even recognize) striking and lasting\ninequalities for women, minorities, or historically oppressed racial\ngroups, when these are merely the cumulative effect of\nindividuals’ free behavior. Okin and others demonstrate, for\nexample, that women have substantial disadvantages in competing in the\nmarket because of childrearing responsibilities which are not equally\nshared with men. As a consequence, any theory relying on market\nmechanisms, including most liberal theories, will yield systems which\nresult in women systematically having less income and wealth than men.\nThus, feminists have challenged contemporary political theorists to\nrethink the boundaries of political authority in the name of securing\na just outcome for women and other historically oppressed groups. \nWhile the political effects of personal freedom pose a serious\nchallenge to contemporary liberal theories of distributive justice,\nthe feminist critiques are somewhat puzzling because, as Jean Hampton\nputs it, many feminists appear to complain in the name of liberal\nvalues. In other words, their claims about the fundamental flaws of\nliberalism at the same time leave intact the various ideals of liberty\nand equality which inspire the liberal theories of justice. Moreover,\nthe task of defining feasible pathways for modifying the structure of\nliberal democracies without undermining their virtues and protections\nhas proved more difficult than setting out the criticisms of\nliberalism. Indeed, despite a legitimate feminist worry about the\neffects of so-called government neutrality on women’s material\nstatus, the relative neutrality of liberal democracies compared to\nnon-liberal societies has been one of the significant contributing\nfactors both to the flourishing of feminist theory and to the many\nsignificant practical gains women in liberal democracies have made\nrelative to women in other parts of the world. The challenge, being\ntaken up by many, is to navigate both a coherent theoretical and\npractical path in response to the best feminist critiques available\n(see the entry on\n feminist ethics).\n  \nHow are we to go about choosing between the different distributive\nprinciples on offer, and respond to criticisms of the principles?\nUnfortunately, few philosophers explicitly discuss the methodology\nthey are using. The most notable exception is John Rawls (1971, 1974)\nwho explicitly brought the method of wide reflective equilibrium to\npolitical philosophy. This method has been brilliantly discussed by\nNorman Daniels over the years and the reader is strongly encouraged to\nrefer to his entry (see\n reflective equilibrium)\n to understand how to evaluate, revise and choose between normative\nprinciples. While there is no point in reiterating the method here\nthere are some supplementary issues worth noting. \nEmpirical data on the beliefs of the population about distributive\njustice was not available when Rawls published A Theory of\nJustice (Rawls 1971) but much empirical work has since been\ncompleted. Swift (1995, 1999) and Miller (1999, chaps. 3–4) have\nprovided surveys of this literature and arguments for why those\ncommitted to the method of reflective equilibrium in distributive\njustice should take the beliefs of the population seriously, though\nnot uncritically. Indeed, some go even further, arguing that the\ndistributive decisions arising through the legitimate application of\nparticular democratic processes might even, at least in part,\nconstitute distributive justice (Walzer 1984). Data on people’s\nbeliefs about distributive justice is also useful for addressing the\nnecessary intersection between philosophical and political processes.\nSuch beliefs put constraints on what institutional and policy reforms\nare practically achievable in any generation—especially when\nthe society is committed to democratic processes. \nTwo final methodological issues need to be noted. The first concerns\nthe distinctive role counterexamples play in debates about\ndistributive justice. As noted above, the overarching methodological\nconcern of the distributive justice literature must be, in the first\ninstance, the pressing choice of how the benefits and burdens of\neconomic activity should be distributed, rather than the mere\nuncovering of abstract truth. Principles are to be implemented in real\nsocieties with the problems and constraints inherent in such\napplication. Given this, pointing out that the application of any\nparticular principle will have some, perhaps many, immoral results\nwill not by itself constitute a fatal counterexample to any\ndistributive theory. Such counter-evidence to a theory would only be\nfatal if there were an alternative, or improved, version of the\ntheory, which, if fully implemented, would yield a morally preferable\nsociety overall. So, it is at least possible that the best\ndistributive theory, when implemented, might yield a system which\nstill has many injustices and/or negative consequences. This practical\naspect partly distinguishes the role of counterexamples in\ndistributive justice theory from many other philosophical areas. Given\nthat distributive justice is about what to do now, not just what to\nthink, alternate distributive theories must, in part, compete as\ncomprehensive systems which take into account the practical\nconstraints we face.  \nThe second and related methodological point is that the evaluation of\nalternate distributive principles requires us (and their advocates) to\nconsider the application of the distributive principle in society. If\nit is uncertain or indeterminate how a particular distributive\nprinciple might in practice apply to the ordering of real societies,\nthen this principle is not yet a serious candidate for our\nconsideration. This is also true of principles whose implementation is\npractically impossible given the institutional, psychological,\ninformational, administrative, or technical constraints of a society.\nDistributive justice is not an area where we can say an idea is good\nin theory but not in practice. If it is not good in practice, then it\nis not good in theory either.","contact.mail":"j.lamont@uq.edu.au","contact.domain":"uq.edu.au"},{"date.published":"1996-09-22","date.changed":"2017-09-26","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-distributive/","author1":"Julian Lamont","author2":"Christi Favor","author1.info":"https://hapi.uq.edu.au/profile/429/julian-lamont","entry":"justice-distributive","body.text":"\n\n\nThe economic, political, and social frameworks that each society \nhas—its laws, institutions, policies, etc.—result in\ndifferent distributions of benefits and burdens across members of the\nsociety. These frameworks are the result of human political processes\nand they constantly change both across societies and within societies\nover time. The structure of these frameworks is important because the\ndistributions of benefits and burdens resulting from them\nfundamentally affect people’s lives. Arguments about which\nframeworks and/or resulting distributions are morally preferable\nconstitute the topic of distributive justice. Principles of\ndistributive justice are therefore best thought of as providing moral\nguidance for the political processes and structures that affect the\ndistribution of benefits and burdens in societies, and any principles\nwhich do offer this kind of moral guidance on distribution, regardless\nof the terminology they employ, should be considered principles of\ndistributive justice.\n\n\nThis entry is structured in the following way. After outlining the\nscope of the entry and the role of distributive principles, the first\nrelatively simple principle of distributive justice examined is Strict\nEgalitarianism, which calls for the allocation of equal material goods\nto all members of society. John Rawls’ alternative distributive\nprinciple, which he calls the Difference Principle, is examined next.\nThe Difference Principle permits diverging from strict equality so\nlong as the inequalities in question would make the least advantaged\nin society materially better off than they would be under strict\nequality. Some have thought that neither strict equality nor\nRawls’ Difference Principle capture the important moral roles of\nluck and responsibility. The “Luck Egalitarianism”\nliterature comprises varying attempts to design distributive\nprinciples that are appropriately sensitive to considerations of\nresponsibility and luck. Desert-based principles similarly emphasize\nthe moral roles of responsibility and luck but are distinct because\nthey approach these factors through claims about what people deserve\nbecause of their work.\n\n\nAdvocates of welfare-based principles (of which utilitarianism is the\nmost famous) do not believe the primary distributive concern should be\nmaterial goods and services. They argue that material goods and\nservices have no intrinsic value but are valuable only in so far as\nthey increase welfare. Hence, they argue, distributive principles\nshould be designed and assessed according to how they affect welfare,\neither its maximization or distribution. Advocates of libertarian\nprinciples, by contrast to each of the principles so far mentioned,\ngenerally criticize any distributive ideal that requires the pursuit\nof specific ‘patterns’, such as maximization or equality\nof welfare or of material goods. They argue that the pursuit of such\npatterns conflicts with the more important moral demands of liberty or\nself-ownership. Finally, feminist critiques of existing distributive\nprinciples note that they tend to ignore the particular circumstances\nof women, so feminists tend to argue for principles which are more\nsensitive to facts such as that women often have primary\nresponsibility for child-rearing and on average, spend less of their\nlifetimes than men in the market economy. \n\nDistributive principles vary in numerous dimensions. They vary in what\nis considered relevant to distributive justice (income, wealth,\nopportunities, jobs, welfare, utility, etc.); in the nature of the\nrecipients of the distribution (individual persons, groups of persons,\nreference classes, etc.); and on what basis the distribution should be\nmade (equality, maximization, according to individual characteristics,\naccording to free transactions, etc.). In this entry, the focus is\nprimarily on principles designed to cover the distribution of benefits\nand burdens of economic activity among individuals in a society.\nAlthough principles of this kind have been the dominant source of\nAnglo-American debate about distributive justice over the last six\ndecades, there are other important distributive justice questions,\nsome of which are covered by other entries in the encyclopedia. These\ninclude questions of distributive justice at the global level rather\nthan just at the national level (see\n justice: international),\n distributive justice across generations (see\n justice: intergenerational)\n and how the topic of distributive justice can be approached, not as a\nset of principles but as a virtue (see\n justice: as a virtue). \nAlthough the numerous distributive principles vary along different\ndimensions, for simplicity, they are presented here in broad\ncategories. Even though these are common classifications in the\nliterature, it is important to keep in mind they necessarily involve\nover-simplification, particularly with respect to the criticisms of\neach of the groups of principles. Some criticisms may not apply\nequally to every principle in the group. The issue of how we are to\nunderstand and respond to criticisms of distributive principles is\ndiscussed briefly in the final section on methodology (see\n Methodology). \nThroughout most of history, people were born into, and largely stayed\nin, a fairly rigid economic position. The distribution of economic\nbenefits and burdens was normally seen as fixed, either by nature or\nby a deity. Only when there was a widespread realization that the\ndistribution of economic benefits and burdens could be affected by\ngovernment did distributive justice become a live topic. Now the topic\nis unavoidable. Governments continuously make and change laws and\npolicies affecting the distribution of economic benefits and burdens\nin their societies. Almost all changes, whether they regard tax,\nindustry, education, health, etc. have distributive effects. As a\nresult, every society has a different distribution at any point in\ntime and we are becoming increasingly more adept at measuring that\ndistribution. More importantly, at every point in time now, each\nsociety is faced with a choice about whether to stay with current\nlaws, policies, etc. or to modify them. The practical contribution of\ndistributive justice theory is to provide moral guidance for these\nconstant choices. \nMany writers on distributive justice have tended to advocate and\ndefend their particular principles by describing or considering ideal\nsocieties operating under them. They have been motivated to do this as\nan aid to understanding what their principles mean. Unfortunately\nthough, as a result of this practice, some readers and the general\npublic have been misled into believing that discussions of\ndistributive justice are merely exercises in ideal theory—to\nbe dismissed as a past-time of the academic elite rather than as\nsomething that is crucially relevant to current political discussion.\nThis misunderstanding is unfortunate because, in the end, the main\npurpose of distributive justice theory is not to inform decisions\nabout ideal societies but about our societies. To help correct this\nmisunderstanding it is important to acknowledge that there has never\nbeen, and never will be, a purely libertarian society or Rawlsian\nsociety, or any society whose distribution conforms to one of the\nproposed principles. Rather than guiding choices between ideal\nsocieties, distributive principles are most usefully thought of as\nproviding moral guidance for the choices that each society faces right\nnow. So, for instance, advocates of Rawls’ Difference Principle\nare most constructively understood as arguing for changes to our basic\ninstitutional structures which would improve the lifetime prospects of\nthe least advantaged in society. Other theorists are arguing for\nchanges to bring economic benefits and burdens more in accordance with\nwhat people really deserve. Libertarians are arguing that reductions\nin government intervention in the economy will better respect liberty\nand/or self-ownership of its citizens. Sometimes a number of the\ntheories may recommend the same changes to our current practices;\nother times they will diverge. It is best to understand the different\ntheorists, despite the theoretical devices they sometimes employ, to\nbe speaking to what should be done in our society—not about\nwhat should be done in some hypothetical society. Of course, ensuring\nthat philosophical principles be effective for the purpose of guiding\npolicy and change in real societies involves important and complex\nmethodological questions. For a review of work specifically addressing\nthis issue, in ideal and nonideal theory, see Zofia Stemplowska and\nAdam Swift (2012), and Valentini (2012). \nDistributive justice theorists (perhaps like all theorists) tend to\nemphasize the differences between their theories. This emphasis also\nprovides an avenue for those who have an interest in ignoring\ndistributive justice to dismiss the relevance of the distributive\njustice literature—‘we cannot get any guidance from\nthese theorists—they completely disagree with each\nother’. Such dismissals misunderstand that it is impossible not\nto take a stand on distributive justice at every moment of a\nsociety’s existence. This misunderstanding is, perhaps, best\nillustrated by the most common type of dismissal. Often governments\ntry to justify inaction, in the face of calls to change some\ngovernment policy in light of some distributive justice concern, on\nthe grounds that there are ‘disagreements/lack of\nconsensus’ about the issue. Of course, there always are\ndisagreements, on any topic, whether moral or empirical, which will\nhave a differential effect on people’s material interests. But\nto think that this points to the desired conclusion—that in\nlight of this we should retain the status quo for the time \nbeing—reveals a confusion about the nature of the choices always\nfacing each society. So, in this instance, to claim that we should not\npursue any changes to our economic structures in light of a\ndistributive justice argument calling for change is, by its very\nnature, to take a stand on the distributive justice of (or, if one\nprefers, the morality of) the current distribution and structures in\nthe society compared to any of the possible alternative distributions\nand structures practically available. At any particular moment the\nexisting economic and institutional framework is influencing the\ncurrent distribution of economic and life prospects for all members of\nthe society. To assert that we should not change the current system is\ntherefore, despite implications to the contrary, to take a substantive\nposition on distributive justice debates. It is to argue that keeping\nthe existing distribution is morally preferable to changing to any\npractical alternative proposed—to take a substantive position\nin just the area that it was claimed was too controversial to\nconsider. Societies cannot avoid taking positions about distributive\njustice all the time and any suggestion that they can should be\nresisted as incoherent. \nA related point can be made when people assert that economic\nstructures and policy should be left to economists, or when people\nassert that economic policy can be pursued without reference to\ndistributive justice. These assertions reveal misconceptions about\nwhat distributive justice and economics are, and how they are related.\nPositive economics, at its best, can tell us about economic causes and\neffects. Positive economics is very important for distributive justice\nbecause it can give us guidance about which changes to pursue in order\nto better instantiate our moral principles. What it cannot do, in the\nabsence of the principles, is tell us what we should do. This point is\neasily lost in everyday political discussion. When an economist says\n‘The Central Bank should raise interest rates’, the\ngeneral population often, mistakenly, believes the recommendation is\npurely coming from the science of economics. Moreover the\n‘should’ is almost always a moral ‘should’.\nWhen economists make such a recommendation they, sometimes\nunconsciously, have taken off their social scientific hat. They are\nemploying alongside their positive economic theory, a moral principle.\nSuppressing, either consciously or unconsciously, that there are\nalways moral arguments being employed in arguments about what economic\npolicies a government should pursue has had the effect of creating\nmisconceptions about the respective roles of positive economics and\ndistributive justice in government decision-making. \nFor instance, the raising of interest rates is typically thought by\neconomists to have the dual effects of suppressing inflation and\nsuppressing employment. To get to a recommendation that the Central\nBank should reduce interest rates involves not only empirical views\nabout the relative sizes of the inflation and unemployment effects and\ntheir long-term impact on growth, etc. but also normative views about\nthe relative moral importance of inflation, employment and growth. For\neconomists, these normative views on economic policies come under the\nrubric of ‘normative’ economics, while philosophers would\ntypically categorize them under ‘distributive justice’.\nBut the rubrics are not important as basically the same area is\ncovered under different names—the normative evaluation of\neconomic policies, structures, or institutions. (To avoid confusion it\nshould be noted that the distributive justice tradition includes\nprinciples which do not use ‘justice’ per se, such as\nutilitarianism, but which are moral principles relating to\ndistribution just the same.) The evaluations often look different\nbecause economists most commonly use utility as their fundamental\nmoral concept while philosophers use a wider variety of moral\nconcepts, but the task in which they are both engaged is very similar.\nWhat is most important to understand here is that positive economics\nalone cannot, without the guidance of normative principles, recommend\nwhich policies, structures, or institutions to pursue. Distributive\njustice theories, such as those discussed in this entry, aim to supply\nthis kind of normative guidance.  \nOne of the simplest principles of distributive justice is that of\nstrict, or radical, equality. The principle says that every person\nshould have the same level of material goods (including burdens) and\nservices. The principle is most commonly justified on the grounds that\npeople are morally equal and that equality in material goods and\nservices is the best way to give effect to this moral ideal.  \nEven with this ostensibly simple principle, some of the difficult\nspecification problems of distributive principles can be seen. The two\nmain problems are the construction of appropriate indices for\nmeasurement (the index problem), and the specification of time frames.\nBecause there are numerous proposed solutions to these problems, the\n‘principle of strict equality’ is not a single principle\nbut a name for a group of closely related principles. This range of\npossible specifications occurs with all the common principles of\ndistributive justice. \nThe index problem arises primarily because the goods and services to\nbe distributed need to be measured if they are going to be distributed\naccording to some pattern (such as equality). The strict equality\nprinciple stated above says that there should be ‘the same\nlevel of material goods and services’. The problem is\nhow to specify and measure levels. The simplest way of solving the\nindex problem in the strict equality case is to specify that everyone\nshould have the same bundle of material goods and services\nrather than the same level (so everyone would have 4 oranges,\n6 apples, 1 bike, etc.). The problem with adopting this simple\nsolution is that there will be many other allocations of material\ngoods and services which will make some people better off without\nmaking anybody else worse off. Such allocations are what are called\n‘Pareto superior’ allocations (see\n equality\n for a more detailed discussion of Pareto efficiency). For instance,\nsomeone who prefers apples to oranges will be better off if she swaps\nsome of her oranges for some of the apples belonging to a person who\nprefers oranges. That way, they are both better off and no one is\nworse off. Indeed, since most everyone will wish to trade something,\nrequiring identical equal bundles will make virtually everybody worse\noff than they would be under an alternative allocation. So specifying\nthat everybody must have the same bundle of goods does not\nseem to be a satisfactory way of solving the index problem. Some index\nfor measuring the value of goods and services is required. \nMoney is an index for the value of material goods and services. It is\nan imperfect index whose pitfalls are documented in most economics\ntextbooks. Moreover, once the goods to be allocated are extended\nbeyond material ones to include goods such as opportunities, money\nmust be combined with other indices. (For instance, John Rawls’\nindex of primary goods—see Rawls 1971.) Nevertheless, using\nmoney, either in the form of income or wealth or both, as an index for\nthe value of material goods and services is the most common response\nto the index problem. In terms of public, rather than academic\ndiscourse, GDP (gross domestic product) or per capita GDP is most\ncommonly touted as the way to measure the effect of governments’\npolicies on the population’s well-being. The deficiencies in\nsuch indices has now been well-documented and has lead to the\nproposing of better alternative indices such as the Human Development\nIndex (HDI) and Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI).\nUnfortunately, the general population is generally unaware of these\nmore accurate indices and so are disadvantaged in their ability to\njudge the distributive justice effects of their governments’\npolicies.  \nThe second main specification problem involves time frames. Many\ndistributive principles identify and require that a particular pattern\nof distribution be achieved or at least be pursued as the objective of\ndistributive justice. But they also need to specify when the\npattern is required. One version of the principle of strict equality\nrequires that all people should have the same wealth at some initial\npoint, after which people are free to use their wealth in whatever way\nthey choose, with the consequence that future outcomes are bound to be\nunequal. Principles specifying initial distributions after which the\npattern need not be preserved are commonly called\n‘starting-gate’ principles. (See Ackerman 1980,\n53–59,168–170,180–186; Alstott and Ackerman\n1999.) \nBecause ‘starting-gate’ principles may eventually lead to\nlarge inequalities, strict egalitarians do not usually favor them. The\nmost common form of strict equality principle specifies that\nincome (measured in terms of money) should be equal in\neach time-frame, though even this may lead to significant\ndisparities in wealth if variations in savings are permitted. Hence,\nstrict equality principles are commonly conjoined with some\nsociety-wide specification of just saving behavior (see\n justice: intergenerational).\n In practice, however, this principle and the starting-gate version\nmight require more similar distributions than it first appears. This\nis because the structure of the family means the requirement to give\npeople equal starts will often necessitate redistribution to parents,\nwho due to bad luck, bad management, or simply their own choices, have\nbeen unsuccessful in accruing or holding on to material goods. \nThere are a number of direct moral criticisms made of strict equality\nprinciples: that they unduly restrict freedom, that they do not give\nbest effect to the moral equality of persons, that they conflict with\nwhat people deserve, etc. (see the sections on\n Libertarian Principles,\n and\n Desert-Based Principles,\n and the entry on\n equality).\n But the most common criticism is a welfare-based one related to the\nPareto efficiency requirement: that everyone can be materially better\noff if incomes are not strictly equal (Carens 1981). It is this\ncriticism which partly inspired the Difference Principle. \nThe wealth of an economy is not a fixed amount from one period to the\nnext, but can be influenced by many factors relevant to economic\ngrowth. These include, for example, technological advancement or\nchanges in policy that affect how much people are able to produce with\ntheir labour and resources. More wealth can be produced and indeed\nthis has been the overwhelming feature of industrialized countries\nover the last couple of centuries. The dominant economic view is that\nwealth is most readily increased in systems where those who are more\nproductive earn greater incomes. This economic view partly inspired\nthe formulation of the Difference Principle.  \nThe most widely discussed theory of distributive justice in the past\nfour decades has been that proposed by John Rawls in A Theory of\nJustice, (Rawls 1971), and Political Liberalism, (Rawls\n1993). Rawls proposes the following two principles of justice: \n1. Each person has an equal claim to a fully adequate scheme of equal\nbasic rights and liberties, which scheme is compatible with the same\nscheme for all; and in this scheme the equal political liberties, and\nonly those liberties, are to be guaranteed their fair value.  \n2. Social and economic inequalities are to satisfy two conditions: (a)\nThey are to be attached to positions and offices open to all under\nconditions of fair equality of opportunity; and (b), they are to be to\nthe greatest benefit of the least advantaged members of society.\n(Rawls 1993, pp. 5–6. The principles are numbered as they were\nin Rawls’ original A Theory of Justice.) \nWhere the rules may conflict in practice, Rawls says that Principle\n(1) has lexical priority over Principle (2), and Principle (2a) has\nlexical priority over (2b). As a consequence of the priority rules,\nRawls’ principles do not permit sacrifices to basic liberties in\norder to generate greater equality of opportunity or a higher level of\nmaterial goods, even for the worst off. While it is possible to think\nof Principle (1) as governing the distribution of liberties, it is not\ncommonly considered a principle of distributive justice given that it\nis not governing the distribution of economic goods per se.\nEquality of opportunity is discussed in the next section. In this\nsection, the primary focus will be on (2b), known as the Difference\nPrinciple.  \nThe main moral motivation for the Difference Principle is similar to\nthat for strict equality: equal respect for persons. Indeed, since the\nonly material inequalities the Difference Principle permits are those\nthat raise the level of the least advantaged in the society, it\nmaterially collapses to a form of strict equality under empirical\nconditions where differences in income have no effect on the work\nincentive of people (and hence, no tendency to increase growth). The\noverwhelming economic opinion though is that in the foreseeable future\nthe possibility of earning greater income will bring forth greater\nproductive effort. This will increase the total wealth of the economy\nand, under the Difference Principle, the wealth of the least\nadvantaged. Opinion divides on the size of the inequalities which\nwould, as a matter of empirical fact, be allowed by the Difference\nPrinciple, and on how much better off the least advantaged would be\nunder the Difference Principle than under a strict equality principle.\nRawls’ principle, however, gives fairly clear guidance on what\ntype of arguments will count as justifications for inequality. Rawls\nis not opposed in principle to a system of strict equality per\nse; his concern is about the absolute position of the\nleast advantaged group rather than their relative position.\nIf a system of strict equality maximizes the absolute position of the\nleast advantaged in society, then the Difference Principle advocates\nstrict equality. If it is possible to raise the absolute position of\nthe least advantaged further by having some inequalities of income and\nwealth, then the Difference Principle prescribes inequality up to that\npoint where the absolute position of the least advantaged can no\nlonger be raised. \nBecause there has been such extensive discussion of the Difference\nPrinciple in the last 40 years, there have been numerous criticisms of\nit from the perspectives of all the other theories of distributive\njustice outlined here. Briefly, the main criticisms are as\nfollows. \nAdvocates of strict equality argue that inequalities permitted by the\nDifference Principle are unacceptable even if they do benefit the\nabsolute position of the least advantaged. The problem for these\nadvocates has been to explain convincingly why society should be\nprevented from materially benefiting the least advantaged when this\nbenefit requires a deviation from strict equality. \nFor the strict egalitarian the relative position of people is\nall important and the absolute position is either not\nimportant at all or lexically inferior. For Rawls, at least with\nrespect to the social and economic inequalities, the opposite is true.\nBut there have been various plausible explanations given in reply to\nRawls’ proposed Difference Principle why relative position is a\nvalue that should be weighed against the value of the\nabsolute position of the least advantaged rather than subordinated\nlexically to it. In an early reply to Rawls, Crocker explains the\nvalue of paying attention to the relative position as a way of\nunderstanding the value of solidarity. His approach fits into a set of\nviews in which being materially equal, or striving towards it, is an\nimportant expression of the equality of persons. \nAnother set of views, in opposition to Rawls’ Difference\nPrinciple, emphasizes the importance of relative position not as a\nvalue in itself but because of its effect on other relations. In\nparticular, if some people are significantly better off materially\nthan others then that can result in them having significant power over\nothers. Rawls’ response to this criticism appeals to the lexical\npriority of his first principle: The inequalities consistent with the\nDifference Principle are only permitted so long as they do not\ncompromise the fair value of the political liberties. So, for\ninstance, very large wealth differentials may make it practically\nimpossible for poor people to be elected to political office or to\nhave their political views represented. These inequalities of wealth,\neven if they increase the material position of the least advantaged\ngroup, may need to be reduced in order for the first principle to be\nimplemented. However, while this provides a partial reply to\nRawls’ critics, it does not seem to recognize that it is not\njust differential political power that can come from significant\ndifferences in economic position but also economic power and hence\neconomic freedom. Virtual monopoly employers in regions of developing\neconomies give a stark illustration of this phenomenon. Of course,\nRawls can appeal in such cases to the empirical claim that such\ndifferentials do not maximize the long-term position of the least\nadvantaged. The empirical question will be whether all such large\ndifferentials which result in large differences in economic power also\ndemonstrably have the result of worsening the absolute position of the\nleast advantaged. \nThe utilitarian objection to the Difference Principle is that it does\nnot maximize utility. In A Theory of Justice, Rawls uses\nutilitarianism as the main theory for comparison with his own, and\nhence he offers a number of arguments in response to this utilitarian\nobjection, some of which are outlined in the section on\n Welfare-Based Principles. \nLibertarians object that the Difference Principle involves\nunacceptable infringements on liberty, property rights, or\nself-ownership. For instance, the Difference Principle may require\nredistributive taxation for the benefit of the poor, and libertarians\ncommonly object that such taxation involves the immoral taking of just\nholdings (see\n Libertarian Principles). \nThe Difference Principle is also criticized as a primary distributive\nprinciple on the grounds that it mostly ignores claims that people\ndeserve certain economic benefits in light of their actions.\nAdvocates of desert-based principles argue that some may deserve a\nhigher level of material goods because of their hard work or\ncontributions even if their unequal rewards do not also function to\nimprove the position of the least advantaged. Desert theorists as well\nas libertarians also argue that the explanation of how people\ncome to be in more or less advantaged positions is morally relevant to\ntheir fairness, yet the Difference Principle ignores these\nexplanations. \nLike desert theorists, advocates of Luck Egalitarian principles argue\nthat the Difference Principle does not fully capture the moral roles\nthey believe luck and responsibility should play in principles of\ndistributive justice. Indeed, ‘luck egalitarianism’ as a\ndistinct approach in the distributive justice literature really\ndeveloped in critical response to Rawls’ theory of distributive\njustice. The reasons for that response are outlined in the next\nsection. \nThe distribution of material goods and services is not the only\neconomic distribution which is important to people. The distribution\nof opportunities is also important. As noted in the previous section,\nJohn Rawls conjoined his Difference Principle with a principle of\nequality of opportunity. Endorsement of some form of equality of\nopportunity is very prevalent among distributive justice theorists\nand, indeed, among the general population, especially when combined\nwith some form of market distributive mechanism. Equality of\nopportunity is often contrasted favorably with ‘equality of\noutcome’ or strict egalitarianism, by those who believe that we\ncan show equal concern, respect, or treatment of people without them\nhaving the same material goods and services, so long as they have\nequal economic opportunities. An equality of opportunity principle\nthen, is combined with other principles to ensure that the\ninequalities permitted by the overall theory (whether utilitarian,\ndesert, or a Rawlsian difference principle) are only justified if\npeople have the relevant kind of equal opportunity to achieve greater\nor lesser amounts of goods. So an equality of opportunity principle\nallows those theorists who depart from strict equality to capture some\nof what nonetheless has motivated egalitarians. What is the morally\nbest interpretation of this equality of opportunity principle has been\na significant focus of research (see\n Equality of Opportunity),\n particularly among luck egalitarians. In fact, the luck egalitarian\nideal (also sometimes known as the ‘level playing field’\nideal) elevates the role of equal opportunity to the central\ndistributive ideal, so that distributive inequalities are only just\nwhen they flow from one’s choices or from factors for which one\ncan reasonably be held responsible. \nIn 1988, Brian Barry gave an interesting reconstruction of the\nreasoning which led John Rawls to his Equal Opportunity and Difference\nPrinciples. Barry’s reconstruction and Ronald Dworkin’s\nearlier discussion (which we will come to later), have been seminal in\nthe rise of the luck egalitarian literature; hence, a version of this\nargument is probably the best introduction to some of the relevant\nmoral issues. \n‘Formal’ equality of opportunity rules out formal\ndiscrimination on grounds such as a person’s race, ethnicity,\nage or gender. What is the underlying concern, shared by most\ntheorists and the general population, with a society lacking formal\nequality of opportunity? The concern seems to be rooted in the belief\nthat traits such as a persons’ gender or race are elements over\nwhich people have no control and, hence, a society in which\npeople’s race or gender have fundamental effects on their\nlifetime economic prospects treats people unfairly. In such societies,\nwhether people were born as the favored gender or race, and hence were\nfavored economically, would simply be a matter of luck. Rawls’\nclaim is that structuring a society so that this ‘natural\nlottery’ has such fundamental effects on people’s lives is\nimmoral, when we have the option to structure it another way, with a\nsystem of formal equality of opportunity.  \nThe foregoing is relatively uncontroversial, but what made\nRawls’ (and Barry’s) arguments so interesting was their\nclaim that this line of reasoning actually leads to much stronger (and\nmore contentious) requirements for social justice. They note that even\nwith formal equality of opportunity, there will remain many factors\nover which people have no control but which will affect their lifetime\neconomic prospects, such as whether a person’s family can afford\nto purchase good quality educational opportunities or health care. A\nsociety therefore will have reasons to adopt a more substantial\nequality of opportunity principle, with equal opportunities for\neducation, health care, etc.—the same reasons it had for\nadopting a merely formal equality of opportunity principle.  \nFollowing this line of reasoning further (and it certainly has\nappeared to many that we have no principled reason to stop here) seems\nto lead to more radical conclusions than those who agreed with formal\nequality of opportunity would have imagined. A society with a more\nsubstantial equality of opportunity principle in place will still not\nbe providing equality of opportunity for all. People are born into\nmore or less nurturing families and social circumstances. People are\nborn into families and neighborhoods which are more or less\nencouraging of education and the development of economically\nadvantageous talents. There are a whole range of social influences\nwhich have fundamental and unequal effects on children’s\neconomic prospects and for which they are in no way \nresponsible—the influences children are exposed to are a matter of their\nluck in the ‘social lottery’. Moreover, the luck of the\nnatural lottery is not just restricted to such characteristics as\ngender and race. Children are more or less fortunate in the\ndistribution of natural talents as well.  \nA race where the starting line is arbitrarily staggered, where\npeople’s prospects for winning are not largely determined by\nfactors for which they are responsible but rather largely by luck, is\nnot considered a fair race. Similarly, if society is structured so\nthat people’s prospects for gaining more economic goods are not\nlargely determined by factors for which they are responsible but\nrather largely by luck, then the society is open to the charge of\nbeing unfair. This is the challenging conclusion with which Barry,\nfollowing Rawls, presents us.  \nIn response to this challenge, Barry himself explores a number of\navenues, including questioning whether economic distribution is really\nanalogous to a race. Rawls, of course, responded to his own challenge\nby arguing that there is not a lot that can be done (morally) to make\nthe social and natural opportunities more equal, so the fair response\nis to adopt the Difference Principle. Others, however, have taken this\nchallenge in different directions. \nRonald Dworkin, (Dworkin 1981a, 1981b, 2000) provided one of the most\ndetailed early responses to Rawls’ challenge. In retrospect,\nDworkin’s theory is often identified as one of the earliest in\nthe luck egalitarian literature, though Dworkin himself called his\ntheory Resource Egalitarianism. Dworkin presented his key insight\n(i.e., what distinguishes him from Rawls) in terms of a distinction\nbetween ‘ambitions’ and ‘endowments’. Dworkin\nuses the term ‘ambitions’ to cover the realm of our\nchoices and what results from our choices, such as the choice to work\nhard, or to spend money on expensive luxuries. His term\n‘endowments’ refers to the results of brute luck, or those\nthings over which we have no control, such as one’s genetic\ninheritance, or unforeseeable bad luck. Dworkin agrees with Rawls that\nnatural inequalities are not distributed according to people’s\nchoices, nor are they justified by reference to some other morally\nrelevant fact about people, so people should not end up worse off as a\nresult of bad luck in the natural lottery. However, Dworkin argues the\nDifference Principle fails to deliver on this ideal, since its\nformulation in terms of primary goods fails to recognize that those\nwho are very unlucky, such as the severely ill or disabled, may need\nconsiderably greater shares of primary goods than others in order to\nachieve a reasonable life. Dworkin also argued that just economic\ndistributions should be more responsive than the Difference Principle\nto the consequences of people’s choices.  \nDworkin proposed that people begin with equal resources but be allowed\nto end up with unequal economic benefits as a result of their own\nchoices. What constitutes a just material distribution is to be\ndetermined by the result of a thought experiment designed to model\nfair distribution. Suppose that everyone is given the same purchasing\npower and each uses that purchasing power to bid, in a fair auction,\nfor resources best suited to their life plans. They are then permitted\nto use those resources as they see fit. Although people may end up\nwith different economic benefits, none of them is given less\nconsideration than another in the sense that if they wanted somebody\nelse’s resource bundle they could have bid for it instead. \nIn Dworkin’s proposal we see his attitudes to\n‘ambitions’ and ‘endowments’ which have become\na central feature of luck egalitarianism (though under a wide variety\nof alternative names and further subset-distinctions). In terms of\nsensitivity to ‘ambitions’, Dworkin and many other luck\negalitarians argue that provided people have an ‘equal’\nstarting point (in Dworkin’s case, resources) they should live\nwith the consequences of their choices. They argue, for instance, that\npeople who choose to work hard to earn more income should not be\nrequired to subsidize those choosing more leisure and hence less\nincome.  \nWith respect to ‘endowments’, Dworkin proposes a\nhypothetical compensation scheme in which he supposes that, before the\nhypothetical auction described above, people do not know their own\nnatural endowments. However, they are able to buy insurance against\nbeing disadvantaged in the natural distribution of talents and they\nknow that their payments will provide an insurance pool to compensate\nthose people who are unlucky in the ‘natural lottery’. \nDworkin’s early proposals were very hypothetical and it was\nsomewhat difficult to see what they meant in practice. Later luck\negalitarians have tried to tease out the practical implications of\ntheir theories in more detail, though much of the debate still remains\nat the theoretical level. They agree with Dworkin’s\nrecommendation, against Rawls’ Difference Principle approach,\nthat those with unequal natural endowments should receive\ncompensation. For instance, people born with disabilities, or\nill-health, who have not brought these circumstances upon themselves,\ncan be explicitly compensated so that they are not disadvantaged in\ntheir economic prospects. Under Rawls’ Difference Principle,\nthough, no such explicit compensation is forthcoming—as Rawls\nsays, the Difference Principle is not the principle of redress (Rawls\n1971, 101). Of course, for the subset of people with long-term\ndisabilities or ill-health who are also in the least advantaged group\n(variously defined by Rawls, but most commonly defined as the lowest\nsocio-economic grouping) the Difference Principle will help. But the\nhelp will not be proportionate to their needs arising from their\ndisabilities or ill-health. \nLuck egalitarians continue to refine such aspects of their theories as\n(a) what they believe is the relevant conception of equality of\nopportunity, (b) how much of a role luck should play in the\ndistribution of economic benefits and (c) what is the best conception\nof ‘luck’ (Arneson 1990 and 2001, Fleurbaey 2001, Hurley\n2001 and 2003, Swift 2008, Sher 2010). Relatedly, they continue to\nexplore what role responsibility should play in the distribution of\neconomic goods (Sen 1985, Cohen 1997, Valentyne 1997, Knight\n2011). \nBecause the luck egalitarian proposals have a similar motivation to\nthe Difference Principle the moral criticisms of them tend to be\nvariations on those leveled against the Difference Principle. However,\nas noted above, what is practically required of a society operating\nunder the Difference Principle is relatively straightforward. How the\ntheoretical concerns of luck egalitarians are to be practically\nimplemented is often not so clear. For instance, it has seemed\nimpossible to measure differences in people’s natural \ntalents—unfortunately, people’s talents do not neatly divide\ninto the natural and those for which people can be held responsible. A\nsystem of special assistance to the physically and mentally disabled\nand to the ill would be a partial implementation of the compensation\nsystem, but most natural inequalities would be left untouched by such\nassistance while the theories commonly require compensation for such\ninequalities. Exploring how in practical ways the economic systems can\nbe refined to track responsibility while mitigating certain types of\npure luck will be an ongoing challenge for luck egalitarians. \nWelfare-based principles are motivated by the idea that what is of\nprimary moral importance is the level of welfare of people. Advocates\nof welfare-based principles view the concerns of other \ntheories—material equality, the level of primary goods of the least\nadvantaged, resources, desert-claims, or liberty—as derivative\nconcerns. They are valuable only in so far as they affect welfare and\nso all distributive questions should be settled entirely by how the\ndistribution affects welfare. \nChoosing welfare as the relevant value is only the first step towards\nanswering the distributive questions. Welfare-theorists must also\nspecify the welfare function. The welfare functions proposed vary\naccording to what will count as welfare and the weighting system for\nthat welfare. Economists defending some form of welfarism normally\nstate the explicit functional form, while philosophers often omit this\nformality, concentrating on developing their theories in answer to two\nquestions: 1) the question of what has intrinsic value (‘what\ncounts as welfare’), and 2) the question of what actions or\npolicies would maximize the intrinsic value. Moreover, philosophers\nhave tended to focus on an extremely small subset of the available\nwelfare functions. Although there are a number of advocates of\nalternative welfare functions (such as ‘equality of\nwell-being’), most philosophical activity has concentrated on a\nvariant known as utilitarianism. This theory can be used to illustrate\nmost of the main characteristics of welfare-based principles. \nHistorically, utilitarians have used the term ‘utility’\nrather than ‘welfare’ and utility has been defined\nvariously as pleasure, happiness, or preference-satisfaction, etc.\nJeremy Bentham, the historical father of utilitarianism, argued that\nthe experience of pleasure was the only thing with intrinsic value,\nand all other things had instrumental value insofar as they contribute\nto the experience of pleasure or the avoidance of pain. His\nintellectual successor, John Stuart Mill, broadened this theory of\nintrinsic value to include happiness, or fulfillment. Modern\nphilosophers since Kenneth Arrow, though, tend to argue that intrinsic\nvalue consists in preference-satisfaction, i.e. in individuals’\nhaving what they want. So, for instance, the principle for\ndistributing economic benefits for preference utilitarians is to\ndistribute them so as to maximize preference-satisfaction. The welfare\nfunction for such a principle has a relatively simple theoretical form\nrequiring the distribution maximizing the arithmetic sum of all\nsatisfied preferences (unsatisfied preferences being negative),\nweighted for the intensity of those preferences. To accommodate\nuncertainty with respect to outcomes the function is modified so that\nexpected utility, rather than utility, is maximized (see\n consequentialism).\n  \nThe basic theory of utilitarianism is one of the simplest to state and\nunderstand. Much of the work on the theory therefore has been directed\ntowards defending it against moral criticisms, particularly from the\npoint of view of ‘commonsense’ morality. The criticisms\nand responses have been widely discussed in the literature on\nutilitarianism as a general moral theory (see\n consequentialism).\n Two of the most widely discussed criticisms will be mentioned\nhere. \nThe first, which was famously articulated by John Rawls (1971), is\nthat utilitarianism fails to take seriously the distinctness of\npersons. Maximization of preference-satisfaction is often taken as\nprudent in the case of individuals—people may take on greater\nburdens, suffering or sacrifice at certain periods of their lives so\nthat their lives are overall better. The complaint against\nutilitarianism is that it takes this principle, commonly described as\nprudent for individuals, and uses it on an entity, society, unlike\nindividuals in important ways. While it may be acceptable for a person\nto choose to suffer at some period in her life (be it a day, or a\nnumber of years) so that her overall life is better, it is often\nargued against utilitarianism that it is immoral to make some people\nsuffer so that there is a net gain for other people. In the individual\ncase, there is a single entity experiencing both the sacrifice and the\ngain. Also, the individuals, who suffer or make the sacrifices, choose\nto do so in order to gain some benefit they deem worth their\nsacrifice. In the case of society as a whole, there is no single\nexperiential entity—some people suffer or are sacrificed so\nthat others may gain. Furthermore, under utilitarianism, unlike the\nindividual prudence case, there is no requirement for people to\nconsent to the suffering or sacrifice, nor is there necessarily a\nunified belief in the society that the outcome is worth the cost. \nA related criticism of utilitarianism involves the way it treats\nindividual preferences about other peoples’ welfare or holdings.\nFor instance, some people may have a preference that the members of\nsome minority racial group have less material benefits. Under\nutilitarian theories, in their classical form, this preference or\ninterest counts like any other in determining the best distribution.\nHence, if racial preferences are widespread and are not outweighed by\nthe minority’s contrary preferences (perhaps because the\nminority is relatively few in number compared to the majority),\nutilitarianism will recommend an inegalitarian distribution based on\nrace if there is not some other utility-maximizing alternative on\noffer. \nUtilitarians have responded to these criticisms in a number of ways.\nOften they just deny the empirical claim upon which the criticism\nrests. So they assert that the empirical conditions are such that\nutility maximizing will rarely require racial minorities to sacrifice\nor suffer for the benefit of others, or to satisfy the prejudices of\nothers. Relatedly, utilitarians often emphasize the long run\nperspective required by their theory. They may concede that short-term\nmaximization may point to distribution on a racial basis but that this\nwould not be welfare-maximizing in the long run and that even greater\nwelfare can be achieved by re-educating the majority so that racist\npreferences weaken or disappear over time, leading to a more\nharmonious and happier world. In reply, it is pointed out that the\nutilitarian must supply an account of why racist or sexist preferences\nshould be discouraged if the same level of total long term utility\ncould be achieved by encouraging the less powerful to be content with\na lower position.  \nCritics of utilitarianism have responded that this reliance on the\nempirical conditions turning out a particular way undermines the\nplausibility of utilitarianism as a moral theory. They argue that we\ndo not have to wait until we find out how strong the racist feelings\nare, how many are in the adversely affected racial minority, how many\nracists there are, etc. to know that racist policies are wrong. It is\nargued that given utilitarianism says that we do need to know these\nnumbers in order to know when, if ever, racist policies are wrong,\nutilitarianism fails to adequately capture our moral judgments.\nUtilitarians respond that if their theory on rare occasions does\nrequire people to sacrifice or suffer in these or other ways, the\nunintuitiveness of this consequence is a result of our contrary moral\njudgments about right and wrong, which are fallible. For many\nutilitarians, commonsense moral judgments are best understood as\nproviding us with ‘rules of thumb’ which are useful at the\nlevel of commonsense morality but can ultimately be mistaken at the\nlevel of ‘critical theory’. \nMost recently, some utilitarians have drawn on institutional theory or\ngame theory in defence, or in modification, of utilitarianism (see\nHardin 1988, Goodin 1995, Bailey 1997). Noting that the consequences\nof individual actions are rarely determined in isolation, but rather\nin conjunction with the actions of many others, these\n‘institutional’ or ‘indirect’ utilitarians\nargue that morally intuitive institutions such as constitutional\nrights, human rights and various property rights would be endorsed by\nthis modified utilitarianism, and would forbid the morally horrible\noutcomes critics have feared utilitarianism could sanction. \nUtilitarian distribution principles, like the other principles\ndescribed here, have problems with specification and implementation.\nMost formulations of utilitarianism require interpersonal comparisons\nof utility. This means, for instance, that we must be able to compare\nthe utility one person gains from eating an apple with that another\ngains from eating an apple. Furthermore, utilitarianism requires that\ndifferences in utility be measured and summed for widely disparate\ngoods (so, for instance, the amount of utility a particular person\ngains from playing football is measured and compared with the amount\nof utility another gains from eating a gourmet meal). Some critics\nhave argued that such interpersonal utility comparisons are\nimpossible, even in theory, because even if all the diverse goods can\nbe combined into a single index of ‘utility’ for an\nindividual, there is no conceptually adequate way of calibrating such\na measure among individuals (see Elster 1991). \nUtilitarians face a greater problem than this theoretical one in\ndetermining what material distribution, or institutional structure, is\nprescribed by their theory. Those who share similar utilitarian\ntheoretical principles frequently recommend very different\ndistributions or structures to implement the principles. This problem\noccurs for other theories, with recommendations for distributions or\neconomic structures to implement commonly varying among advocates with\nsimilar theoretical principles. But the advocates for other\ndistributive principles tend to cluster significantly with respect to\nwhat they recommend. This is much less the case with respect to\nadvocates for utilitarian and welfare-based distribution principles\nwith advocates dispersed in their recommendations across the full\nrange of possible distributions and economic structures. For instance,\nmany preference utilitarians believe their principle prescribes\nstrongly egalitarian structures with lots of state intervention while\nother preference utilitarians believe it prescribes a laissez\nfaire style of capitalism. \nThere is an explanation for why utilitarianism seems so much less\ndeterminate in its policy (including structural) recommendations and\nit points to what is the greatest challenge to utilitarianism as a\nguiding distributive principle. Other distributive principles can rule\nout, relatively quickly, various policies on the grounds that they\nclearly violate the guiding principle, but utilitarians must examine,\nin great detail, all the policies on offer. For each policy, they must\ndetermine the distribution of goods and services yielded by the policy\nand at least three other factors: the identity of each person in the\ndistribution (if individuals’ utility functions differ); the\nutility of each person from the goods and services distributed to\nthem; the utility of each person from the policy itself. They must\nthen aggregate these utilities across all individuals. The size of the\ninformation requirements make this task impossible. Hence, broad\nassumptions must be made and each different set of assumptions will\nyield a different answer, and so the answers range across the full set\nof policies on offer. Moreover, there is no obvious way to arbitrate\nbetween the different sets of assumptions. For instance, suppose three\nutilitarians agree on the same utilitarian distributive principle.\nUtilitarian 1, for example, may assert that the population’s\nutility function conforms to function A (e.g. people’s marginal\nutility is diminishing at rate R) and is maximized by Policy 1;\nUtilitarian 2, however, asserts that half the population’s\nutility function conforms to function A and half to function B (e.g.\npeople’s marginal utility is diminishing at rate 2R) and is\nmaximized by Policy 2; Utilitarian 3 asserts Utilitarian 2 is correct\nabout the utility functions of the population but claims that Policy 3\nis the one that will maximize utility. The challenge for contemporary\nutilitarians is to explain, given the massive informational\nrequirements of utilitarianism and our apparent human inability to\nmeet those requirements, how the population, and its experts, can\nplausibly arbitrate between conflicting policy and institutional\nrecommendations coming from utilitarian theorists who share the same\nunderlying normative principle. \nAnother complaint against welfarism is that it ignores, and in fact\ncannot even make sense of, claims that people deserve certain\neconomic benefits in light of their actions (Feinberg, Lamont 1997).\nThe complaint is often motivated by the concern that various forms of\nwelfarism treat people as mere containers for well-being, rather than\npurposeful beings, responsible for their actions and creative in their\nenvironments.  \nThe various proposed\n desert-based\n principles of distribution differ primarily according to what they\nidentify as the basis for deserving. While Aristotle proposed virtue,\nor moral character, to be the best desert-basis for economic\ndistribution, contemporary desert theorists have proposed desert-bases\nthat are more practically implemented in complex modern societies.\nMost contemporary desert theorists have pursued John Locke’s\nlead in this respect. Locke argued people deserve to have those items\nproduced by their toil and industry, the products (or the value\nthereof) being a fitting reward for their effort (see Miller 1989).\nLocke’s underlying idea was to guarantee to individuals the\nfruits of their own labor and abstinence. Most contemporary proposals\nfor desert-bases fit into one of three broad categories: \nAccording to the contemporary desert theorist, people freely apply\ntheir abilities and talents, in varying degrees, to socially\nproductive work. People come to deserve varying levels of income by\nproviding goods and services desired by others (Feinberg 1970).\nDistributive systems are just insofar as they distribute incomes\naccording to the different levels earned or deserved by the\nindividuals in the society for their productive labors, efforts, or\ncontributions. \nContemporary desert-principles all share the value of raising the\nstandard of living—collectively, ‘the social\nproduct’. Under each principle, only activity directed at\nraising the social product will serve as a basis for deserving income.\nThe concept of desert itself does not yield this value of raising the\nsocial product; it is a value societies hold independently. Hence,\ndesert principles identifying desert-bases tied to socially productive\nactivity (productivity, compensation, and effort all being examples of\nsuch bases) do not do so because the concept of desert requires this.\nThey do so because societies value higher standards of living, and\ntherefore choose the raising of living standards as the primary value\nrelevant to desert-based distribution. This means that the full\ndevelopment of desert-based principles requires specification (and\ndefense) of those activities which will or will not count as socially\nproductive, and hence as deserving of remuneration (Lamont 1994). \nIt is important to distinguish desert-payments from entitlements. For\ndesert theorists a well-designed institutional structure will make it\nso that many of the entitlements people have are deserved. But\nentitlements and just deserts are not conceptually the same and\nregularly come apart. For instance, as Feinberg notes, a person can be\nentitled to assume the presidential office without deserving it\n(Feinberg 1970, 86) and a person who accidentally apprehends a\ncriminal may be entitled to a reward but not deserve it. Conversely, a\nteam may deserve to win the championship prize but not be entitled to\nit or a person may deserve an economic benefit but not be entitled to\nit. Indeed, these and many other instances of desert and entitlements\ncoming apart provide the bases for desert theorists to argue for\ninstitutional reform. For desert theorists, the institutional\nstructure should facilitate people’s economic entitlements\n(including one’s property holdings) tracking their just\ndeserts. \nPayments designed to give people incentives are a form of entitlement\nparticularly worth distinguishing from desert-payments as they are\ncommonly confused (Barry 1965, 111–112). Incentive-payments are\n‘forward-looking’ in that they are set up to create a\nsituation in the future, while desert-payments are\n‘backwards-looking’in that they are justified with\nreference to work in the present or past. Even though it is possible\nfor the same payment to be both deserved and an incentive, incentives\nand desert provide distinct rationales for income and should not be\nconflated (Lamont 1997). \nWhile some have sought to justify current capitalist distributions via\ndesert-based distributive principles, John Stuart Mill and many since\nhave forcefully argued the contrary claim—that the\nimplementation of a productivity principle would involve dramatic\nchanges in modern market economies and would greatly reduce the\ninequalities characteristic of them. It is important to note, though,\nthat contemporary desert-based principles are rarely complete\ndistributive principles. They usually are only designed to cover\ndistribution among working adults, leaving basic welfare needs to be\nmet by other principles. \nThe specification and implementation problems for desert-based\ndistribution principles revolve mainly around the desert-bases: it is\ndifficult to identify what is to count as a contribution, an effort or\na cost, and it is even more difficult to measure these in a complex\nmodern economy. \nThe main moral objection to desert-based principles is that they make\neconomic benefits depend on factors over which people have little\ncontrol. John Rawls has made one of the most widely discussed\narguments to this effect (Rawls 1971), and while a strong form of this\nargument has been clearly refuted (Zaitchik, Sher), it remains a\nproblem for desert-based principles. The problem is most pronounced in\nthe case of productivity-based principles—people’s\nproductivity seems clearly to be influenced by many factors over which\nthey have little control. \nIt is interesting to note that under most welfare-based principles, it\nis also the case that people’s level of economic benefits\ndepends on factors beyond their control. But welfarists view this as a\nvirtue of their theory, since they think the only morally relevant\ncharacteristic of any distribution is the welfare resulting from it.\nWhether the distribution ties economic benefits to matters beyond our\ncontrol is morally irrelevant from the welfarist point of view. (As it\nhappens, welfarists often hold the empirical claim that people have\nlittle control over their contributions to society anyway.) However,\nfor people’s benefits to depend on factors beyond their control\nis a more awkward result for desert theorists who, with luck\negalitarians, emphasize the responsibility of people in choosing to\nengage in more or less productive activities. \nMost contemporary versions of the principles discussed so far allow\nsome role for the market as a means of achieving the desired\ndistributive pattern—the Difference Principle uses it as a\nmeans of helping the least advantaged; utilitarian principles commonly\nuse it as a means of achieving the distributive pattern maximizing\nutility; desert-based principles rely on it to distribute goods\naccording to desert, etc. In contrast, advocates of libertarian\ndistributive principles rarely see the market as a means to some\ndesired pattern, since the principle(s) they advocate do not\nostensibly propose a ‘pattern’ at all, but instead\ndescribe the sorts of acquisitions or exchanges which are just in\ntheir own right. The market will be just, not as a means to some\npattern, but insofar as the exchanges permitted in the market satisfy\nthe conditions of just acquisition and exchange described by the\nprinciples. For libertarians, just outcomes are those arrived at by\nthe separate just actions of individuals; a particular distributive\npattern is not required for justice. Robert Nozick advanced this\nversion of libertarianism (Nozick 1974), and is its best known\ncontemporary advocate.  \nNozick proposes a 3-part “Entitlement Theory”. \nThe complete principle of distributive justice would say simply that a\ndistribution is just if everyone is entitled to the holdings they\npossess under the distribution (Nozick, p.151). \nThe statement of the Entitlement Theory includes reference to the\nprinciples of justice in acquisition and transfer. (For details of\nthese principles see Nozick, pp.149–182.) The principle of\njustice in transfer is the least controversial and is designed to\nspecify fair contracts while ruling out stealing, fraud, etc. The\nprinciple of justice in acquisition is more complicated and more\ncontroversial. The principle is meant to govern the gaining of\nexclusive property rights over the material world. For the\njustification of these rights, Nozick takes his inspiration from John\nLocke’s idea that everyone ‘owns’ themselves and, by\nmixing one’s labors with the world, self-ownership can generate\nownership of some part of the material world. However, of\nLocke’s mixing metaphor, Nozick legitimately asks:\n‘…why isn’t mixing what I own with what I\ndon’t own a way of losing what I own rather than a way of\ngaining what I don’t? If I own a can of tomato juice and spill\nit in the sea so its molecules... mingle evenly throughout the sea, do\nI thereby come to own the sea, or have I foolishly dissipated my\ntomato juice?’ (Nozick 1974, p.174) Nozick concludes that what\nis significant about mixing our labor with the material world is that\nin doing so, we tend to increase the value of it, so that\nself-ownership can lead to ownership of the external world in such\ncases (Nozick 1974, pp. 149–182). \nThe obvious objection to this claim is that it is not clear why the\nfirst people to acquire some part of the material world should be able\nto exclude others from it (and, for instance, be the land owners while\nthe later ones become the wage laborers). In response to this\nobjection, Nozick follows Locke in recognizing the need for a\nqualification on just acquisition. According to the Lockean\nProviso, an exclusive acquisition of the external world is just,\nif, after the acquisition, there is ‘enough and as good left in\ncommon for others’. One of the main challenges for libertarians\nhas been to formulate a morally plausible interpretation of this\nproviso. According to Nozick’s weaker version of Locke’s\nProviso, “a process normally giving rise to a permanent\nbequeathable property right in a previously unowned thing will not do\nso if the position of others no longer at liberty to use the thing is\nthereby worsened” (Nozick, 1974, p. 178). For Nozick’s\ncritics, his proviso is unacceptably weak. This is partly because it\nfails to consider the position others may have achieved under\nalternative distributions and thereby instantiates the morally dubious\ncriterion of whoever is first gets the exclusive spoils. For example,\none can satisfy Nozick’s proviso by ‘acquiring’ a\nbeach and charging $1 admission to those who previously were able to\nuse the beach for free, so long as one compensates them with a benefit\nthey deem equally valuable, such as a clean-up or life-guarding\nservice on the beach. However, the beach-goers would have been even\nbetter off had the more efficient organizer among them acquired the\nbeach, charging only 50 cents for the same service, but this\nalternative is never considered under Nozick’s proviso (Cohen,\n1995). \nWill Kymlicka has given a summary of the steps in Nozick’s\nself-ownership argument: \nThe assessment of this argument is quite complex, but the difficulties\nmentioned above with the proviso call into question claims (3) and\n(4). The challenge for libertarians then is to find a plausible\nreading of (3) which will yield (4). Moreover, Nozick extends the\noperation of the proviso to apply both to acquisitions and transfers,\ncompounding the problem (Nozick, 1974, p. 174). \nEgalitarian leaning theorists generally have opposed Nozick’s\nform of libertarianism on the grounds that its implementation would\nlead to potentially vast material inequalities. However, a subset of\negalitarians have nevertheless been attracted to the normative\nstrength and implications of self-ownership, concerned that an\nunconstrained pursuit of equality could pose a danger to\npeople’s rights over themselves and their labor. G.A. Cohen\neloquently expresses this concern: \nOf course, many existing holdings are the result of acquisitions or\ntransfers which at some point did not satisfy the principles of\njustice for acquisitions or transfers, however these are understood.\nHence, libertarians who rely on historical principles to underpin\nproperty rights must supplement these with a principle of\nrectification for past injustice, or at least some strategy for\ndealing with unjust holdings. Although Nozick does not specify this\nprinciple he does describe its purpose: \nNozick does not make an attempt to provide a principle of\nrectification. The absence of such a principle is much worse for a\nhistorical theory than for a patterned theory. Past injustices\nsystematically undermine the justice of every subsequent distribution\nin historical theories. Nozick is clear that his historical theory\ncannot be used to evaluate the justice of actual societies until such\na theory of rectification is given or no considerations of\nrectification of injustice could apply to justify the distribution in\nthe actual society:  \nUnfortunately for the theory, it would seem that no such treatment\nwill ever be forthcoming because the task is, for all practical\npurposes, impossible. The numbers of injustices perpetrated throughout\nhistory, both within nations and between them, are enormous and the\nnecessary details of the vast majority of injustices are unavailable.\nEven if the details of the injustices were available, the\ncounterfactual causal chains could not be reliably determined. As\nDerek Parfit has pointed out, in a different context, even the people\nwho would have been born would have been different (Parfit 1986). As a\nconsequence, it is difficult to see how Nozick’s entitlement\ntheory could provide guidance as to what the current distribution of\nmaterial holdings should be or what distributions or redistributions\nare legitimate or illegitimate. (Indeed Nozick suggests, for instance,\nthe Difference Principle may be the best implementation of the\nprinciple of rectification.) Although Nozick is fairly candid about\nthis consequence, many of his supporters and critics have ignored it\nand have carried on a vigorous debate as though, contrary to\nNozick’s own statement, his theory can be used to evaluate the\njustice of current economic distributions.  \nClassical libertarians such as Nozick usually advocate a system in\nwhich there are exclusive property rights, with the role of the\ngovernment restricted to the protection of these property rights. The\nproperty rights commonly rule out taxation for purposes other than\nraising the funds necessary to protect property rights. One of the\nstrongest critiques of any attempt to institute such a system of\nlegally protected strong property rights comes, as we have seen, from\nNozick’s theory itself—there seems no obvious reason to\ngive strong legal protection to property rights which have arisen\nthrough violations of the just principles of acquisition and transfer.\nBut putting this critique to one side for a moment, what other\narguments are made in favor of exclusionary property rights? \nAs already noted, Nozick argues that because people own themselves and\nhence their talents, they own whatever they can produce with these\ntalents. Moreover, it is possible in a free market to sell the\nproducts of exercising one’s talents. Any taxation of the income\nfrom such selling, according to Nozick, ‘institute[s] (partial)\nownership by others of people and their actions and labor’\n(Nozick, p. 172). People, according to this argument, have these\nexclusive rights of ownership. Taxation then, simply involves\nviolating these rights and allowing some people to own (partially)\nother people. Moreover, it is argued, any system not legally\nrecognizing these rights violates Immanuel Kant’s maxim to treat\npeople always as ends in themselves and never merely as a means. The\ntwo main difficulties with this argument have been: (1) to show that\nself-ownership is only compatible with having such strong exclusive\nproperty rights; and (2) that a system of exclusive property rights is\nthe best system for treating people with respect, as ends in\nthemselves. \nNozick candidly accepts that he does not himself give a systematic\nmoral justification of the exclusionary property rights he advocates:\n‘This book does not present a precise theory of the moral basis\nof individual rights.’ (Nozick, p.xiv) But others have tried to\nprovide more systematic justifications of similar rights (Lomasky,\nSteiner) or to develop, more fully, justifications to which Nozick\nalludes. \nIn addition to the arguments from self-ownership, and the requirement\nto treat people as ends in themselves, the most common other route for\ntrying to justify exclusive property rights has been to argue that\nthey are required for the maximization of freedom and/or liberty or\nthe minimization of violations of these (Hayek 1960). As an empirical\nclaim though, this appears to be false. If we compare countries with\nless exclusionary property rights (e.g. more taxation) with countries\nwith more exclusionary property regimes, we see no systematic\nadvantage in freedoms or liberties enjoyed by people in the latter\ncountries. (Of course, we do see a difference in distribution\nof such freedoms or liberties. In the latter countries, the richer\nhave more and the poorer less, while in the former they are more\nevenly distributed.) Now if libertarians restrict what counts as a\nvaluable freedom/liberty (and discount other freedoms/liberties people\nvalue), it will follow that exclusionary property rights are required\nto maximize freedom and/or liberty or to minimize violations of these.\nBut the challenge for these libertarians is to show why only their\nfavored liberties and freedoms are valuable, and not those which are\nweakened by a system of exclusive property rights. \nThere is no one feminist conception of distributive justice; feminists\ndefend positions across the political spectrum. Hence, feminists offer\ndistinctive versions of all the theories considered so far as well as\nothers. One way of thinking about what unifies many feminist theorists\nis an interest in what difference, if any, the practical experience of\ngender makes to the subject matter or study of justice; how different\nfeminists answer this question distinguishes them from each other and\nfrom those alternative distributive principles that most inspire their\nthinking. \nThe distributive principles so far outlined, with the exception of\nstrict egalitarianism, are often described as falling under the broad\nclassification of liberalism—they both inform, and are the\nproduct of, the liberal democracies which have emerged over the last\ntwo centuries. Lumping them together this way, though somewhat clumsy,\nmakes the task of understanding the emergence of feminist critiques\n(and the subsequent positive theories) much easier. \nJohn Stuart Mill in The Subjection of Women (1869) gives one\nof the clearest early feminist critiques of the political and\ndistributive structures of the emerging liberal democracies. His\nwritings provided the starting point for many contemporary liberal\nfeminists. Mill argued that the principles associated with the\ndeveloping liberalism of his time required equal political status for\nwomen. The principles Mill explicitly mentions include a rejection of\nthe aristocracy of birth, equal opportunity in education and in the\nmarketplace, equal rights to hold property, a rejection of the man as\nthe legal head of the household, and equal rights to political\nparticipation. Feminists inspired by Mill believe that a proper\nrecognition of the position of women in society requires that women be\ngiven equal and the same rights as men have, and that these primarily\nprotect their liberty and their status as equal persons under the law.\nThus, government regulation should not prevent women from competing on\nequal terms with men in educational, professional, marketplace and\npolitical institutions. The problem for women, on the liberal feminist\nview, is not liberalism but the failure of society and the State to\nproperly instantiate liberal principles. \nFrom the point of view of other feminisms, the liberal feminist\nposition is a conservative one, in the sense that it requires the\nproper inclusion for women of the rights, protections, and\nopportunities previously secured for men, rather than a fundamental\nchange from the traditional liberal position. One phrase or motto\naround which a whole range of feminists have rallied marks a\nsignificant break with Mill’s liberalism: ‘the personal is\npolitical.’ Feminists have offered a variety of interpretations\nof this motto, many of which take the form of a critique of liberal\ntheories. Mill was crucial in developing the liberal doctrine of\nlimiting the state’s intervention in the private lives of\ncitizens. Many contemporary feminists have argued that the resulting\nliberal theories of justice have fundamentally been unable to\naccommodate the injustices that have their origins in this\n‘protected’ private sphere. This particular feminist\ncritique has also been a primary source of inspiration for the broader\nmulticultural critique of liberalism. The liberal commitments to\ngovernment neutrality and to a protected personal sphere of liberty,\nwhere the government must not interfere, have been primary critical\ntargets. \nWhile issues about neutrality and personal liberty go beyond debates\nabout distributive justice they also have application within these\ndebates. The feminist critics recognize that liberalism correctly\nidentifies the government as one potential source of oppression\nagainst individuals, and therefore recommends powerful political\nprotections of individual liberty. They argue, however, that liberal\ntheories of distributive justice are unable to address the oppression\nwhich surfaces in the so-called private sphere of government\nnon-interference. Susan Moller Okin, for example, documents the\neffects of the institution of the nuclear family, arguing that the\nconsequence of this institution is a position of systematic material\nand political inequality for women. Standard liberal theories,\ncommitted to neutrality in the private sphere, seem powerless to\naddress (or sometimes even recognize) striking and lasting\ninequalities for women, minorities, or historically oppressed racial\ngroups, when these are merely the cumulative effect of\nindividuals’ free behavior. Okin and others demonstrate, for\nexample, that women have substantial disadvantages in competing in the\nmarket because of childrearing responsibilities which are not equally\nshared with men. As a consequence, any theory relying on market\nmechanisms, including most liberal theories, will yield systems which\nresult in women systematically having less income and wealth than men.\nThus, feminists have challenged contemporary political theorists to\nrethink the boundaries of political authority in the name of securing\na just outcome for women and other historically oppressed groups. \nWhile the political effects of personal freedom pose a serious\nchallenge to contemporary liberal theories of distributive justice,\nthe feminist critiques are somewhat puzzling because, as Jean Hampton\nputs it, many feminists appear to complain in the name of liberal\nvalues. In other words, their claims about the fundamental flaws of\nliberalism at the same time leave intact the various ideals of liberty\nand equality which inspire the liberal theories of justice. Moreover,\nthe task of defining feasible pathways for modifying the structure of\nliberal democracies without undermining their virtues and protections\nhas proved more difficult than setting out the criticisms of\nliberalism. Indeed, despite a legitimate feminist worry about the\neffects of so-called government neutrality on women’s material\nstatus, the relative neutrality of liberal democracies compared to\nnon-liberal societies has been one of the significant contributing\nfactors both to the flourishing of feminist theory and to the many\nsignificant practical gains women in liberal democracies have made\nrelative to women in other parts of the world. The challenge, being\ntaken up by many, is to navigate both a coherent theoretical and\npractical path in response to the best feminist critiques available\n(see the entry on\n feminist ethics).\n  \nHow are we to go about choosing between the different distributive\nprinciples on offer, and respond to criticisms of the principles?\nUnfortunately, few philosophers explicitly discuss the methodology\nthey are using. The most notable exception is John Rawls (1971, 1974)\nwho explicitly brought the method of wide reflective equilibrium to\npolitical philosophy. This method has been brilliantly discussed by\nNorman Daniels over the years and the reader is strongly encouraged to\nrefer to his entry (see\n reflective equilibrium)\n to understand how to evaluate, revise and choose between normative\nprinciples. While there is no point in reiterating the method here\nthere are some supplementary issues worth noting. \nEmpirical data on the beliefs of the population about distributive\njustice was not available when Rawls published A Theory of\nJustice (Rawls 1971) but much empirical work has since been\ncompleted. Swift (1995, 1999) and Miller (1999, chaps. 3–4) have\nprovided surveys of this literature and arguments for why those\ncommitted to the method of reflective equilibrium in distributive\njustice should take the beliefs of the population seriously, though\nnot uncritically. Indeed, some go even further, arguing that the\ndistributive decisions arising through the legitimate application of\nparticular democratic processes might even, at least in part,\nconstitute distributive justice (Walzer 1984). Data on people’s\nbeliefs about distributive justice is also useful for addressing the\nnecessary intersection between philosophical and political processes.\nSuch beliefs put constraints on what institutional and policy reforms\nare practically achievable in any generation—especially when\nthe society is committed to democratic processes. \nTwo final methodological issues need to be noted. The first concerns\nthe distinctive role counterexamples play in debates about\ndistributive justice. As noted above, the overarching methodological\nconcern of the distributive justice literature must be, in the first\ninstance, the pressing choice of how the benefits and burdens of\neconomic activity should be distributed, rather than the mere\nuncovering of abstract truth. Principles are to be implemented in real\nsocieties with the problems and constraints inherent in such\napplication. Given this, pointing out that the application of any\nparticular principle will have some, perhaps many, immoral results\nwill not by itself constitute a fatal counterexample to any\ndistributive theory. Such counter-evidence to a theory would only be\nfatal if there were an alternative, or improved, version of the\ntheory, which, if fully implemented, would yield a morally preferable\nsociety overall. So, it is at least possible that the best\ndistributive theory, when implemented, might yield a system which\nstill has many injustices and/or negative consequences. This practical\naspect partly distinguishes the role of counterexamples in\ndistributive justice theory from many other philosophical areas. Given\nthat distributive justice is about what to do now, not just what to\nthink, alternate distributive theories must, in part, compete as\ncomprehensive systems which take into account the practical\nconstraints we face.  \nThe second and related methodological point is that the evaluation of\nalternate distributive principles requires us (and their advocates) to\nconsider the application of the distributive principle in society. If\nit is uncertain or indeterminate how a particular distributive\nprinciple might in practice apply to the ordering of real societies,\nthen this principle is not yet a serious candidate for our\nconsideration. This is also true of principles whose implementation is\npractically impossible given the institutional, psychological,\ninformational, administrative, or technical constraints of a society.\nDistributive justice is not an area where we can say an idea is good\nin theory but not in practice. If it is not good in practice, then it\nis not good in theory either.","contact.mail":"c.favor@uq.edu.au","contact.domain":"uq.edu.au"}]
