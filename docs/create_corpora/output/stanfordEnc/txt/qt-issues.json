This gives rise to the collection\nof philosophical issues known as “the interpretation of quantum\nmechanics”. One should not be misled by this terminology into\nthinking that what we have is an uninterpreted mathematical formalism\nwith no connection to the physical world. Rather, there is a common\ncore of interpretation that consists of recipes for calculating\nprobabilities of outcomes of experiments performed on systems\nsubjected to certain state preparation procedures. What are often\nreferred to as different “interpretations” of quantum\nmechanics differ on what, if anything, is added to the common core.\nArguably, two of the major approaches, hidden-variables theories and\ncollapse theories, involve formulation of physical theories distinct\nfrom standard quantum mechanics; this renders the terminology of\n“interpretation” even more inappropriate.  \nMuch of the philosophical literature connected with quantum theory\ncenters on the problem of whether we should construe the theory, or a\nsuitable extension or revision of it, in realist terms, and, if so,\nhow this should be done. Various approaches to the “Measurement\nProblem” propose differing answers to these questions. There\nare, however, other questions of philosophical interest. These include\nthe bearing of quantum nonlocality on our understanding of spacetime\nstructure and causality, the question of the ontological character of\nquantum states, the implications of quantum mechanics for information\ntheory, and the task of situating quantum theory with respect to other\ntheories, both actual and hypothetical. In what follows, we will touch\non each of these topics, with the main goal being to provide an entry\ninto the relevant literature, including the Stanford Encyclopedia\nentries on these topics. \nIn this section we present a brief introduction to quantum theory; see\nthe entry on \n quantum mechanics\n for a more detailed introduction. \nIn classical physics, with any physical system is associated a state\nspace, which represents the totality of possible ways of assigning\nvalues to the dynamical variables that characterize the state of the\nsystem. For example, for a system consisting of \\(n\\) point particles,\nthe state of the system is given by specifying the positions and\nmomenta of all of the particles with respect to some reference frame.\nFor systems of a great many degrees of freedom, a complete\nspecification of the state of the system may be unavailable or\nunwieldy; classical statistical mechanics deals with such a situation\nby invoking a probability distribution over the state space of the\nsystem. A probability distribution that assigns any probability other\nthan one or zero to some physical quantities is regarded as an\nincomplete specification of the state of the system.  \nIn quantum mechanics, things are different. There are no quantum\nstates that assign definite values to all physical quantities, and\nprobabilities are built into the standard formulation of the theory.\nConstruction of a quantum theory of some physical system proceeds by\nfirst associating the dynamical degrees of freedom with operators on\nan appropriately constructed Hilbert space (see the entry on\n quantum mechanics for details). \nA state can be characterized by an assignment of expectation values to\nphysical quantities (“observables”).  These assignments\nare required to be linear. That is, if one physical quantity\nis a linear combination of others, the corresponding expectation\nvalues stand in the same relation. A complete set of such expectation\nvalues is equivalent to a specification of probabilities for outcomes\nof all experiments that could be performed on the system. Two\nphysical quantities are said to be compatible if there is a\nsingle experiment that yields values for them both; these are\nassociated with operators that commute, that is, operators \\(A\\),\n\\(B\\) such that \\(AB = BA\\). Incompatible observables give rise to\nuncertainty relations; see the entry on\n the uncertainty principle. \nA pure state, that is, a maximally specific assignment of expectation\nvalues, may be represented in a number of physically equivalent ways, for\ninstance by a vector in the Hilbert space or a projection operator\nonto a one-dimensional subspace. In addition to pure states, one can\nalso consider non-pure states, called mixed; these are\nrepresented by operators called density operators. If a pure\nstate assigns a definite value to a physical quantity, a vector that\nrepresents the state will be an eigenvector of the corresponding\noperator. This gives rise to what has been called the\n“eigenstate-eigenvalue link”, that is, the interpretative\nprinciple that, if a system is assigned a state vector that\nis an eigenvector of some operator representing a physical quantity,\nthen the corresponding dynamical quantity has the corresponding value,\nand this can be regarded as a property of the physical system. \nThe noncontroversial core of quantum theory consists of rules for\nidentifying, for any given system, the appropriate operators\nrepresenting its dynamical quantities, and an appropriate Hilbert\nspace for these operators to act on. In addition, there are\nprescriptions for evolving the state of system when it is acted upon\nby specified external fields or subjected to various manipulations\n(see\n section 1.3). \nWhether we can or can expect to be able to go beyond this\nnoncontroversial core, and take the theory to be more than a means for\ncalculating probabilities of outcomes of experiments, is an issue that\nremains a topic of contemporary philosophical discussion. \nQuantum mechanics is usually taken to refer to the quantized\nversion of a theory of classical mechanics, involving systems with a\nfixed, finite number of degrees of freedom. Classically, a field, such\nas, for example, an electromagnetic field, is a system endowed with\ninfinitely many degrees of freedom. Quantization of a field theory\ngives rise to a quantum field theory. The chief philosophical\nissues raised by quantum mechanics remain when the transition is made\nto a quantum field theory; in addition, new interpretational issues\narise. There are interesting differences, both technical and\ninterpretational, between quantum mechanical theories and quantum\nfield theories; for an overview, see the entries on\n quantum field theory\n and\n quantum theory: von Neumann vs. Dirac. \nThe standard model of quantum field theory, successful as it is, does\nnot yet incorporate gravitation. The attempt to develop a theory that\ndoes justice both the quantum phenomena and to gravitational phenomena\ngives rise to serious conceptual issues (see the entry on\n quantum gravity). \nThe equation of motion obeyed by a quantum state vector is the\nSchrödinger equation. It is constructed by first forming\nthe operator \\(H\\) corresponding to the Hamiltonian of the system,\nwhich represents the total energy of the system. The rate of change of\na state vector is proportional to the result of operating on the\nvector with the Hamiltonian operator \\(H\\). \nThere is an operator that takes a state at time 0 into a state at time\n\\(t\\); it is given by \nThis operator is a linear operator that implements a one-one mapping\nof the Hilbert space to itself that preserves the inner product of any\ntwo vectors; operators with these properties are called unitary\noperators, and, for this reason, evolution according to the\nSchrödinger equation is called unitary evolution. \nFor our purposes, the most important features of this equation is that\nit is deterministic and linear. The state vector at\nany time, together with the equation, uniquely determines the state\nvector at any other time. Linearity means that, if two vectors\n\\(\\ket{\\psi_1(0)}\\) and \\(\\ket{\\psi_2(0)}\\) evolve into vectors\n\\(\\ket{\\psi_1(t) }\\) and \\(\\ket{\\psi_2(t)}\\), respectively, then, if\nthe state at time 0 is a linear combination of these two, the state at\nany time \\(t\\) will be the corresponding linear combination of\n\\(\\ket{\\psi_1(t)}\\) and \\(\\ket{\\psi_2(t)}\\). \nTextbook formulations of quantum mechanics usually include an\nadditional postulate about how to assign a state vector after an\nexperiment. This has its origins in von Neumann’s distinction\nbetween two types of processes: Process 1, which occurs upon\nperformance of an experiment, and Process 2, the unitary evolution\nthat takes place as long as no experiment is made (see von Neumann\n1932, 1955: §V.1). In Dirac’s formulation, the postulate\nis \nWhen we measure a real dynamical variable \\(\\xi\\), the disturbance\ninvolved in the act of measurement causes a jump in the state of the\ndynamical system. From physical continuity, if we make a second\nmeasurement of the same dynamical variable \\(\\xi\\) immediately after\nthe first, the result of the second measurement must be the same as\nthat of the first. Thus after the first measurement has been made,\nthere is no indeterminacy in the result of the second. Hence, after\nthe first measurement has been made, the system is in an eigenstate of\nthe dynamical variable \\(\\xi\\), the eigenvalue it belongs to being\nequal to the result of the first measurement. This conclusion must\nstill hold if the second measurement is not actually made. In this way\nwe see that a measurement always causes the system to jump into an\neigenstate of the dynamical variable that is being measured, the\neigenvalue this eigenstate belongs to being equal to the result of the\nmeasurement (Dirac 1935: 36). \nDirac’s “jump” has come to be known as state\nvector collapse or wave-function collapse, and the\npostulation of a jump of this sort is called the collapse\npostulate, or projection postulate. \nIf the quantum state vector is thought to represent only a state of\nbelief or knowledge about a physical system, and not the physical\nstate of the system, then one could regard an abrupt shift in the\nstate vector upon measurement as a shift corresponding to\nincorporating the result of the measurement into one’s belief\nstate. Neither von Neumann nor Dirac, however, seem to think of it\nthis way; it is treated by both as a physical process. Note, also,\nthat Dirac expresses the postulate in terms of\n“measurement”, rather than “observation”;\nthere is no suggestion that a conscious observer must become aware of\nthe result of the measurement in order for a collapse to occur.\nThough, in his extended discussion of the measurement process, von\nNeumann (1932, 1955, Ch. VI) does discuss the act of observation, he\nemphasizes that the collapse postulate may be applied to interactions\nwith quantum systems with measuring apparatus, before an observer is\naware of the result. A formulation of a version of the collapse\npostulate according to which a measurement is not completed until the\nresult is observed is found in London and Bauer (1939). They deny,\nhowever, that it represents a mysterious kind of interaction between\nthe observer and the quantum system; for them, the replacement of the\npre-observation state vector with a new one is a matter of the\nobserver acquiring new information. These two interpretations of the\ncollapse postulate, as either a real change of the physical state of\nthe system, or as a mere updating of information on the part of an\nobserver, have persisted in the literature. \nIf state vector collapse is to be regarded as a physical process, this\nraises the question of what physically distinguishes\ninterventions that are to count as “measurements”, capable\nof inducing an abrupt jump in the state of the system, from other\ninterventions, which induce only continuous, unitary evolution. As\nJohn S. Bell (1990) has argued, “measurement” is not an\nappropriate concept to appear in the formulation of any physical\ntheory that might be taken to be fundamental. If, however, one\ndispenses with the postulate, this gives rise to the so-called\n“measurement problem”, which we will discuss after we have\nintroduced the notion of entanglement (see\n section 3). \nGiven two disjoint physical systems, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), with which we\nassociate Hilbert spaces \\(H_{A}\\) and \\(H_{B}\\), the Hilbert space\nassociated with the composite system is the tensor product space,\ndenoted \\(H_{A} \\otimes H_{B}\\). \nWhen the two systems are independently prepared in pure states\n\\(\\ket{\\psi}\\) and \\(\\ket{\\phi}\\), the state of the composite system\nis the product state \\(\\ket{\\psi} \\otimes \\ket{\\phi}\\)\n(sometimes written with the cross, \\(\\otimes\\), omitted). \nIn addition to the product states, the tensor product space contains\nlinear combinations of product states, that is, state vectors of the\nform \nThe tensor product space can be defined as the smallest Hilbert space\ncontaining all of the product states. Any pure state represented by a\nstate vector that is not a product vector is an entangled\nstate. \nThe state of the composite system assigns probabilities to outcomes of\nall experiments that can be performed on the composite system. We can\nalso consider a restriction to experiments performed on system \\(A\\),\nor a restriction to experiments performed to \\(B\\). Such restrictions\nyields states of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), respectively, called the reduced\nstates of the systems. When the state of the composite system\n\\(AB\\) is an entangled state, then the reduced states of \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\) are mixed states. To see this, suppose that in the above state\nthe vectors \\(\\ket{\\phi_{1}}\\) and \\(\\ket{\\phi_{2}}\\) represent\ndistinguishable states. If one confines one’s attention to\nexperiments performed on \\(A\\), it makes no difference whether an\nexperiment is also performed on \\(B\\). An experiment performed on\n\\(B\\) that distinguishes \\(\\ket{\\phi_{1}}\\) and \\(\\ket{\\phi_{2}}\\)\nprojects the state of \\(A\\) into either \\(\\ket{\\psi_{1}}\\) or\n\\(\\ket{\\psi_{2}}\\), with probabilities \\(\\abs{a}^{2}\\) and\n\\(\\abs{b}^{2}\\), respectively, and probabilities for outcomes of\nexperiments performed on \\(A\\) are the corresponding averages of\nprobabilities for states \\(\\ket{\\psi_{1}}\\) and \\(\\ket{\\psi_{2}}\\).\nThese probabilities, as mentioned, are the same as those for the\nsituation in which no experiment is performed on \\(B\\). Thus, even if\nno experiment is performed on \\(B\\), the probabilities of outcomes of\nexperiments on \\(A\\) are exactly as if system \\(A\\) is either in the\nstate represented by \\(\\ket{\\psi_{1}}\\) or the state represented by\n\\(\\ket{\\psi_{2}}\\), with probabilities \\(\\abs{a}^{2}\\) and\n\\(\\abs{b}^{2}\\), respectively. \nIn general, any state, pure or mixed, that is neither a product state\nnor a mixture of product states, is called an entangled\nstate. \nThe existence of pure entangled states means that, if we consider a\ncomposite system consisting of spatially separated parts, then, even\nwhen the state of the system is a pure state, the state is not\ndetermined by the reduced states of its component parts. Thus, quantum\nstates exhibit a form of nonseparability. See the entry on \n holism and nonseparability in physics\n for more information. \nQuantum entanglement results in a form of nonlocality that is alien to\nclassical physics. Even if we assume that the reduced states of \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\) do not completely characterize their physical states, but\nmust be supplemented by some further variables, there are quantum\ncorrelations that cannot be reduced to correlations between states of\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\); see the entries on\n Bell’s Theorem\n and\n action at a distance in quantum mechanics. \nIf quantum theory is meant to be (in principle) a universal theory, it\nshould be applicable, in principle, to all physical systems, including\nsystems as large and complicated as our experimental apparatus.\nConsider, now, a schematized experiment. Suppose we have a quantum\nsystem that can be prepared in at least two distinguishable states,\n\\(\\ket{0} _{S}\\) and \\(\\ket{1} _{S}\\). Let \\(\\ket{R} _{A}\\) be a ready\nstate of the apparatus, that is, a state in which the apparatus is\nready to make a measurement. \nIf the apparatus is working properly, and if the measurement is a\nminimally disturbing one, the coupling of the system \\(S\\) with the\napparatus \\(A\\) should result in an evolution that predictably yields\nresults of the form \nwhere \\(\\ket{“0” } _{A}\\) and \\(\\ket{“1”}\n_{A}\\) are apparatus states indicating results 0 and 1,\nrespectively. \nNow suppose that the system \\(S\\) is prepared in a superposition of\nthe states \\(\\ket{0} _{S}\\) and \\(\\ket{1}_{S}\\). \nwhere \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both nonzero. If the evolution that leads\nfrom the pre-experimental state to the post-experimental state is\nlinear Schrödinger evolution, then we will have \nThis is not an eigenstate of the instrument reading variable, but is,\nrather, a state in which the reading variable and the system variable are\nentangled with each other. The eigenstate-eigenvalue link, applied to\na state like this, does not yield a definite result for the instrument\nreading. The problem of what to make of this is called the\n“measurement problem” which is discussed in more detail\nbelow. \nIf quantum state evolution proceeds via the Schrödinger equation\nor some other linear equation, then, as we have seen in the previous\nsection, typical experiments will lead to quantum states that are\nsuperpositions of terms corresponding to distinct experimental\noutcomes. It is sometimes said that this conflicts with our\nexperience, according to which experimental outcome variables, such as\npointer readings, always have definite values. This is a misleading\nway of putting the issue, as it is not immediately clear how to\ninterpret states of this sort as physical states of a system that\nincludes experimental apparatus, and, if we can’t say what it\nwould be like to observe the apparatus to be in such a state, it makes\nno sense to say that we never observe it to be in a state like\nthat. \nNonetheless, we are faced with an interpretational problem. If we take\nthe quantum state to be a complete description of the system, then the\nstate is, contrary to what would antecedently expect, not a state\ncorresponding to a unique, definite outcome. This is what led J.S.\nBell to remark, “Either the wavefunction, as given by the\nSchrödinger equation, is not everything, or it is not\nright” (Bell 1987: 41, 2004: 201). This gives us a (prima\nfacie) tidy way of classifying approaches to the measurement\nproblem: \nWe include in the first category approaches that deny that a quantum\nstate should be thought of as representing anything in reality at all.\nThese include variants of the Copenhagen interpretation, as well as\npragmatic and other anti-realist approaches. Also in the first\ncategory are approaches that seek a completion of the quantum state\ndescription. These include hidden-variables approaches and modal\ninterpretations. The second category of interpretation motivates a\nresearch programme of finding suitable indeterministic modifications\nof the quantum dynamics. Approaches that reject both horns of\nBell’s dilemma are typified by Everettian, or\n“many-worlds” interpretations. \nFrom the early days of quantum mechanics, there has been a strain of\nthought that holds that the proper attitude to take towards quantum\nmechanics is an instrumentalist or pragmatic one. On such a view,\nquantum mechanics is a tool for coordinating our experience and for\nforming expectations about the outcomes of experiments. Variants of\nthis view include what has been called the Copenhagen Interpretation\n(or Copenhagen Interpretations, as recent scholarship has emphasized\ndifferences between figures associated with this view); see the entry on\n Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.\n More recently, views of this sort have been advocated by physicists,\nincluding QBists, who hold that quantum states represent subjective or\nepistemic probabilities (see Fuchs et al. 2014). The\nphilosopher Richard Healey defends a related view on which quantum\nstates, though objective, do not represent physical reality (see\nHealey 2012; Healey forthcoming). \nTheories whose structure include the quantum state but include\nadditional structure, with an aim of circumventing the measurement\nproblem, have traditionally been called “hidden-variables\ntheories”. That a quantum state description cannot be regarded\nas a complete description of physical reality was argued for in a\nfamous paper by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) and by Einstein in\nsubsequent publications (Einstein 1936, 1948, 1949). See the entry on\n the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument \nin quantum theory.  \nThere are a number of theorems that circumscribe the scope of possible\nhidden-variables theories. The most natural thought would be to seek a\ntheory that assigns to all quantum observables definite values that\nare merely revealed upon measurement, in such a way that any\nexperimental procedure that, in conventional quantum mechanics, would\ncount as a “measurement” of an observable yields the\ndefinite value assigned to the observable. Theories of this sort are\ncalled noncontextual hidden-variables theory. It was shown by\nBell (1966) and Kochen and Specker (1967) that there are no such\ntheories for any system whose Hilbert space dimension is greater than\nthree (see the entry on\n the Kochen-Specker theorem). \nThe Bell-Kochen-Specker Theorem does not rule out hidden-variables\ntheories tout court. The simplest way to circumvent it is to\npick as always-definite some observable or compatible set of\nobservables that suffices to guarantee determinate outcomes of\nexperiments; other observables are not assigned definite values and\nexperiments thought of as “measurements” of these\nobservables do not reveal pre-existing values. \nThe most thoroughly worked-out theory of this type is the pilot wave\ntheory developed by de Broglie and presented by him at the Fifth\nSolvay Conference held in Brussels in 1927, revived by David Bohm in\n1952, and currently an active area of research by a small group of\nphysicists and philosophers. According to this theory, there are\nparticles with definite trajectories, that are guided by the quantum\nwave function. For the history of the de Broglie theory, see the\nintroductory chapters of Bacciagaluppi and Valentini 2009. For any\noverview of the de Broglie-Bohm theory and philosophical issues\nassociated with it see the entry on\n Bohmian mechanics. \nThere have been other proposals for supplementing the quantum state\nwith additional structure; these have come to be called modal\ninterpretations; see the entry on\n modal interpretations of quantum mechanics\n  \nAs already mentioned, von Neumann and Dirac wrote as if the collapse\nof the quantum state vector precipitated by an experimental\nintervention on the system is a genuine physical change, distinct from\nthe usual unitary evolution. If collapse is to be taken as a genuine\nphysical process, then something more needs to be said about the\ncircumstances under which it occurs than merely that it happens when\nan experiment is performed. This gives rise to a research programme of\nformulating a precisely defined dynamics for the quantum state that\napproximates the linear, unitary Schrödinger evolution in\nsituations for which this is well-confirmed, and produces collapse to\nan eigenstate of the outcome variable in typical experimental set-ups,\nor, failing that, a close approximation to an eigenstate. The only\npromising collapse theories are stochastic in nature; indeed, it can\nbe shown that a deterministic collapse theory would permit\nsuperluminal signalling. (see the entry on \n collapse theories\n for an overview). \nPrima facie, a dynamical collapse theory of this type can be\na quantum state monist theory, one on which, in Bell’s words,\n“the wave function is everything”. In recent years, this\nhas been disputed; it has been argued that collapse theories require\n“primitive ontology” in addition to the quantum state. See\nAllori et al. 2008; also the entry on\n collapse theories,\n and references therein. \nIn his doctoral dissertation of 1957 (reprinted in Everett 2012), Hugh\nEverett III proposed that quantum mechanics be taken as it is, without\na collapse postulate and without any “hidden variables”.\nThe resulting interpretation he called the relative state\ninterpretation. \nThe basic idea is this. After an experiment, the quantum state of the\nsystem plus apparatus is typically a superposition of terms\ncorresponding to distinct outcomes. As the apparatus interacts with\nits environment, which may include observers, these systems become\nentangled with the apparatus and quantum system, the net result of\nwhich is a quantum state involving, for each of the possible\nexperimental outcomes, a term in which the apparatus reading\ncorresponds to that outcome, there are records of that outcome in the\nenvironment, observers observe that outcome, etc.. Everett\nproposed that each of these terms be taken to be equally real. From a\nGod’s-eye-view, there is no unique experimental outcome, but one\ncan also focus on a particular determinate state of one subsystem,\nsay, the experimental apparatus, and attribute to the other systems\nparticipating in the entangled state a relative state,\nrelative to that state of the apparatus. That is, relative to the\napparatus reading ‘+’ is a state of the environment\nrecording that result and states of observers observing that result\n(see the entry on\n Everett’s relative-state formulation of quantum mechanics,\n for more detail on Everett’s views).  \nEverett’s work has inspired a family of views that go by the\nname of “Many Worlds” interpretations; the idea is that\neach of the terms of the superposition corresponds to a coherent\nworld, and all of these worlds are equally real. As time goes on,\nthere is a proliferation of these worlds, as situations arise that\ngive rise to a further multiplicity of outcomes (see the entry\n many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics,\n and Saunders 2007, for overviews of recent discussions; Wallace 2012\nis an extended defense of an Everettian interpretation of quantum\nmechanics). \nThere is a family of distinct, but related views, that go by the name\nof “Relational Quantum Mechanics”. These views agree with\nEverett in attributing to a system definite values of dynamical\nvariables only relative to the states of other systems; they differ in\nthat, unlike Everett, they do not take the quantum state as their\nbasic ontology (see the entry on\n relational quantum mechanics\n for more detail). \nA quantum state that is a superposition of two distinct terms, such\nas \nwhere \\(\\ket{\\psi_{1}}\\) and \\(\\ket{\\psi_{2}}\\) are distinguishable\nstates, is not the same state as a mixture of \\(\\ket{\\psi_{1}}\\) and\n\\(\\ket{\\psi_{2}}\\), which would be appropriate for a situation in\nwhich the state prepared was either \\(\\ket{\\psi_{1}}\\) or\n\\(\\ket{\\psi_{2}}\\), but we don’t know which. The difference\nbetween a coherent superposition of two terms and a mixture has\nempirical consequences. To see this, consider the double-slit\nexperiment, in which a beam of particles (such as electrons, neutrons,\nor photons) passes through two narrow slits and then impinges on a\nscreen, where the particles are detected. Take \\(\\ket{\\psi_{1}}\\) to\nbe a state in which a particle passes through the top slit, and\n\\(\\ket{\\psi_{2}}\\), a state in which it passes through the bottom\nslit. The fact that the state is a superposition of these two\nalternatives is exhibited in interference fringes at the screen,\nalternating bands of high and low rates of absorption. \nThis is often expressed in terms of a difference between classical and\nquantum probabilities. If the particles were classical particles, the\nprobability of detection at some point \\(p\\) of the screen would\nsimply be a weighted average of two conditional probabilities: the\nprobability of detection at \\(p\\), given that the particle passed\nthrough the top slit, and the probability of detection at \\(p\\), given\nthat the particle passed through the bottom slit. The appearance of\ninterference is an index of nonclassicality. \nSuppose, now, that the electrons interact with something else (call it\nthe environment) on the way to the screen, that could serve\nas a “which-way” detector; that is, the state of this\nauxiliary system becomes entangled with the state of the electron in\nsuch a way that its state is correlated with \\(\\ket{\\psi_{1}}\\) and\n\\(\\ket{\\psi_{2}}\\). Then the state of the quantum system, \\(s\\), and\nits environment, \\(e\\), is \nIf the environment states \\(\\ket{\\phi_{1}} _{e}\\) are\n\\(\\ket{\\phi_{2}}_{e}\\) are distinguishable states, then this\ncompletely destroys the interference fringes: the particles interact\nwith the screen as if they determinately went through one slit or the\nother, and the pattern that emerges is the result of overlaying the\ntwo single-slit patterns. That is, we can treat the particles as if\nthey obeyed (approximately) definite trajectories, and apply\nprobabilities in a classical manner. \nNow, macroscopic objects are typically in interaction with a large and\ncomplex environment—they are constantly being bombarded with air\nmolecules, photons, and the like. As a result, the reduced state of\nsuch a system quickly becomes a mixture of quasi-classical states, a\nphenomenon known as decoherence. \nA generalization of decoherence lies at the heart of an approach to\nthe interpretation of quantum mechanics that goes by the name of\ndecoherent histories approach (see the entry on\n the consistent histories approach to quantum mechanics\n for an overview). \nDecoherence plays important roles in the other approaches to quantum\nmechanics, though the role it plays varies with approach; see the entry on\n the role of decoherence in quantum mechanics\n for information on this. \nAll of the above approaches take it that the goal is to provide an\naccount of events in the world that recovers, at least in some\napproximation, something like our familiar world of ordinary objects\nbehaving classically. None of the mainstream approaches accord any\nspecial physical role to conscious observers. There have,\nhowever, been proposals in that direction (see the entry on\n quantum approaches to consciousness\n for discussion). \nAll of the above-mentioned approaches are consistent with observation.\nMere consistency, however, is not enough; the rules for connecting\nquantum theory with experimental results typically involve nontrivial\n(that is, not equal to zero or one) probabilities assigned to\nexperimental outcomes. These calculated probabilities are confronted\nwith empirical evidence in the form of statistical data from repeated\nexperiments. Extant hidden-variables theories reproduce the quantum\nprobabilities, and collapse theories have the intriguing feature of\nreproducing very close approximations to quantum probabilities for all\nexperiments that have been performed so far but departing from the\nquantum probabilities for other conceivable experiments. This permits,\nin principle, an empirical discrimination between such theories and\nno-collapse theories. \nA criticism that has been raised against Everettian theories is that\nit is not clear whether they can even make sense of statistical\ntesting of this kind, as it does not, in any straightforward way, make\nsense to talk of the probability of obtaining, say, a ‘+”\noutcome of a given experiment when it is certain that all possible\noutcomes will occur on some branch of the wavefunction. This has been\ncalled the “Everettian evidential problem”. It has been\nthe subject of much recent work on Everettian theories; see Saunders\n(2007) for an introduction and overview. \nIf one accepts that Everettians have a solution to the evidential\nproblem, then, among the major lines of approach, none is favored in a\nstraightforward way by the empirical evidence. If one is to make a\ndecision as to which, if any, one should accept, it is to be made on\nother grounds. There will not be space here to give an in-depth\noverview of these ongoing discussions, but a few considerations can be\nmentioned, to give the reader a flavor of the discussions; see entries\non particular approaches for more detail. \nBohmians claim, in favor of the Bohmian approach, that a theory on\nthese lines provides the most straightforward picture of events;\nontological issues are less clear-cut when it comes to Everettian\ntheories or collapse theories. \nAnother consideration is compatibility with relativistic causal\nstructure. The de Broglie-Bohm theory requires a distinguished\nrelation of distant simultaneity for its formulation, and, it can be\nargued, this is an ineliminable feature of any hidden-variables theory\nof this sort, that selects some observable to always have definite\nvalues (see Berndl et al. 1996; Myrvold 2002). On the other\nhand, there are collapse models that are fully relativistic. On such\nmodels, collapses are localized events. Though probabilities of\ncollapses at spacelike separation from each other are not independent,\nthis probabilistic dependence does not require us to single one out as\nearlier and the other later. Thus, such theories do not require a\ndistinguished relation of distant simultaneity. There remains,\nhowever, some discussion of how to equip such theories with beables\n(or “elements of reality”). See the entry on\n collapse theories\n and references therein; see also, for some recent contributions to the\ndiscussion, Fleming 2016, Maudlin 2016, and Myrvold 2016. \nIn the case of Everettian theories, one must first think about how to\nformulate the question of relativistic locality. Several authors have\napproached this issue in somewhat different ways, with a common\nconclusion that Everettian quantum mechanics is, indeed, local. (See\nVaidman 1994; Baccialuppi 2002; Chapter 8 of Wallace 2012; Tipler\n2014; Vaidman 2016; and Brown and Timpson 2016.) \nAs mentioned, a central question of interpretation of quantum\nmechanics concerns whether quantum states should be regarded as\nrepresenting anything in physical reality. If this is answered in the\naffirmative, this gives rise to new questions, namely, what sort of\nphysical reality is represented by the quantum state, and whether a\nquantum state could in principle give an exhaustive account of\nphysical reality. \nHarrigan and Spekkens (2010) have introduced a framework for\ndiscussing these issues. In their terminology, a complete\nspecification of the physical properties is given by the ontic\nstate of a system. An ontological model posits a space of ontic\nstates and associates, with any preparation procedure, a probability\ndistribution over ontic states. A model is said to be\n\\(\\psi\\)-ontic if the ontic state uniquely determines the\nquantum state; that is, if there is a function from ontic states to\nquantum states (this includes both cases in which the quantum state\nalso completely determines the physical state, and cases, such as\nhidden-variables theories, in which the quantum state does not\ncompletely determine the physical state). In their terminology, models\nthat are not \\(\\psi\\)-ontic are called \\(\\psi\\)-epistemic. If\na model is not \\(\\psi\\)-ontic, this means that it is possible for some\nontic states to be the result of two or more preparations that lead to\ndifferent assignments of pure quantum states; that is, the same ontic\nstate may be compatible with distinct quantum states. \nThis gives a nice way of posing the question of quantum state realism:\nare there preparations corresponding to distinct pure quantum states\nthat can give rise to the same ontic state, or, conversely, are there\nontic states compatible with distinct quantum states? Pusey, Barrett,\nand Rudolph (2012) showed that, if one adopts a natural independence\nassumption about state preparations—namely, the assumption that\nit is possible to prepare a pair of systems in such a way that the\nprobabilities for ontic states of the two systems are effectively\nindependent—then the answer is negative; any ontological model\nthat reproduces quantum predictions and satisfies this Preparation\nIndependence assumption must be a \\(\\psi\\)-ontic model. \nThe Pusey, Barrett and Rudolph (PBR) theorem does not close off all\noptions for anti-realism about quantum states; an anti-realist about\nquantum states could reject the Preparation Independence assumption,\nor reject the framework within which the theorem is set; see\ndiscussion in Spekkens 2015: 92–93. See also Leifer (2014) for a\ncareful and thorough overview of theorems relevant to quantum state\nrealism. \nThe major realist approaches to the measurement problem are all, in\nsome sense, realist about quantum states. Merely saying this is\ninsufficient to give an account of the ontology of a given\ninterpretation. Among the questions to be addressed are: if quantum\nstates represent something physically real, what sort of thing is it?\nThis is the question of the ontological construal of quantum states.\nAnother question is the EPR question, whether a description in terms\nof quantum states can be taken as, in principle, complete, or whether\nit must be supplemented by different ontology. \nDe Broglie’s original conception of the “pilot wave”\nwas that it would be a field, analogous to an electromagnetic field.\nThe original conception was that each particle would have its own\nguiding wave. However, in quantum mechanics as it was developed at the\nhands of Schrödinger, for a system of two or more particles we\ndon’t have individual wave functions for each particle, but,\nrather, a single wave function that is defined on \\(n\\)-tuples of\npoints in space, where \\(n\\) is the number of particles. This was\ntaken, by de Broglie, Schrödinger and others, to militate against\nthe conception of quantum wave functions as fields. If quantum states\nrepresent something in physical reality, they are unlike anything\nfamiliar in classical physics. \nOne response that has been taken is to insist that quantum wave\nfunctions are fields nonetheless, albeit fields on a space of\nenormously high dimension, namely, \\(3n\\), where \\(n\\) is the number\nof elementary particles in the universe. On this view, this\nhigh-dimensional space is thought of as more fundamental than the\nfamiliar three-dimensional space (or four-dimensional spacetime) that\nis usually taken to be the arena of physical events. See Albert (1996,\n2013), for the classic statement of the view; other proponents include\nLoewer (1996), Lewis (2004), Ney (2012, 2013a,b, 2015), and North\n(2013). Most of the discussion of this proposal has taken place within\nthe context of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, which is not a\nfundamental theory. It has been argued that considerations of how the\nwave functions of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics arise from a\nquantum field theory undermines the idea that wave functions are\nrelevantly like fields on configuration space, and also the idea that\nconfiguration spaces can be thought of as more fundamental than\nordinary spacetime (Myrvold 2015). \nA view that takes a wave function as a field on a high-dimensional\nspace must be distinguished from a view that takes it to be what Belot\n(2012) has called a multi-field, which assigns properties to\n\\(n\\)-tuples of points of ordinary three-dimensional space. These are\ndistinct views; proponents of the \\(3n\\)-dimensional conception make\nmuch of the fact that it restores Separability: on this view, a\ncomplete specification of the way the world is, at some time, is given\nby specification of local states of affairs at each address in the\nfundamental (\\(3n\\)-dimensional) space. Taking a wave function to be a\nmulti-field, on the other hand, involves accepting nonseparability.\nAnother difference between taking wave-functions as multi-fields on\nordinary space and taking them to be fields on a high-dimensional\nspace is that, on the multi-field view, there is no question about the\nrelation of ordinary three-dimensional space to some more fundamental\nspace.­ \nIt has been argued that, on the de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave theory and\nrelated pilot wave theories, the quantum state plays a role more\nsimilar to that of a law in classical mechanics; its role is to\nprovide dynamics for the Bohmian corpuscles, which, according to the\ntheory, compose ordinary objects. See Dürr, Goldstein, and\nZanghì 1997 and Allori et al. 2008. \nDürr, Goldstein, and Zanghì (1992) introduced the term\n“primitive ontology” for what, according to a physical\ntheory, makes up ordinary physical objects; on the de Broglie-Bohm\ntheory, this is the Bohmian corpuscles. The conception is extended to\ninterpretations of collapse theories by Allori et al. (2008).\nPrimitive ontology is to be distinguished from other ontology, such as\nthe quantum state, that is introduced into the theory to account for\nthe behavior of the primitive ontology. The distinction is meant to be\na guide as to how to conceive of the nonprimitive ontology of the\ntheory. \nQuantum mechanics has not only given rise to interpretational\nconundrums; it has given rise to new concepts in computing and in\ninformation theory. Quantum information theory is the study\nof the possibilities for information processing and transmission\nopened up by quantum theory. This has given rise to a different\nperspective on quantum theory, one on which, as Bub (2000, 597) put\nit, “the puzzling features of quantum mechanics are seen as a\nresource to be developed rather than a problem to be solved”\n(see the entries on\n quantum computing\n and\n quantum entanglement and information).\n  \nAnother area of active research in the foundations of quantum\nmechanics is the attempt to gain deeper insight into the structure of\nthe theory, and the ways in which it differs from both classical\nphysics and other theories that one might construct, by characterizing\nthe structure of the theory in terms of very general principles, often\nwith an information-theoretic flavour. \nThis project has its roots in early work of Mackey (1957, 1963),\nLudwig (1964), and Piron (1964) aiming to characterize quantum\nmechanics in operational terms. This has led to the development of a\nframework of generalized probabilistic model. It also has connections\nwith the investigations into quantum logic initiated by Birkhoff and\nvon Neumann (1936) (see the entry\n quantum logic and probability theory\n for an overview). \nInterest in the project of deriving quantum theory from axioms with\nclear operational content was revived by the work of Hardy (2001\n[2008], Other Internet Resources).  Significant results along these\nlines include the axiomatizations of Masanes and Müller (2011)\nand Chiribella, D’Ariano, and Perinotti (2011). See Chiribella  and Spekkens \n2015 for a snapshot of the state of the art of this\nendeavour.","contact.mail":"wmyrvold@uwo.ca","contact.domain":"uwo.ca"}]
