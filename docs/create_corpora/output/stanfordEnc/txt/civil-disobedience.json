When is\ncivil disobedience morally justified? How should the law respond to\npeople who engage in civil disobedience? Discussions of civil\ndisobedience have tended to focus on the first two of these questions.\nOn the most widely accepted account of civil disobedience, famously\ndefended by John Rawls (1971), civil disobedience is a public,\nnon-violent and conscientious breach of law undertaken with the aim of\nbringing about a change in laws or government policies. On this\naccount, people who engage in civil disobedience are willing to\naccept the legal consequences of their actions, as this shows their\nfidelity to the rule of law. Civil disobedience, given its place at the\nboundary of fidelity to law, is said to fall between legal protest, on\nthe one hand, and conscientious refusal, revolutionary action, militant\nprotest and organised forcible resistance, on the other hand.\n\n\n\nThis picture of civil disobedience raises many questions. Why must\ncivil disobedience be non-violent? Why must it be public, in the sense\nof forewarning authorities of the intended action, since publicity\ngives authorities an opportunity to interfere with the action? Why must\npeople who engage in civil disobedience be willing to accept\npunishment? A general challenge to Rawls's conception of civil\ndisobedience is that it is overly narrow, and as such it predetermines\nthe conclusion that most acts of civil disobedience are morally\njustifiable. A further challenge is that Rawls applies his theory of\ncivil disobedience only to the context of a nearly just society,\nleaving unclear whether a credible conception of either the nature or\nthe justification of civil disobedience could follow the same lines in\nthe context of less just societies. Some broader accounts of civil\ndisobedience offered in response to Rawls's view (Raz 1979;\nGreenawalt 1987) will be examined in the first section of this\nentry.\n\n\n\nThis entry has four main sections. The first considers some\ndefinitional issues and contrasts civil disobedience with both ordinary\noffences and other types of dissent. The second analyses two sets of\nfactors relevant to the justification of civil disobedience; one set\nconcerns the disobedient's particular choice of action, the other\nconcerns her motivation for so acting. The third section examines whether people have a right to engage in civil\ndisobedience. The fourth considers what kind of legal response to civil\ndisobedience is appropriate.\n\n\n\nThe term ‘civil disobedience’ was coined by Henry David\nThoreau in his 1848 essay to describe his refusal to pay the state poll\ntax implemented by the American government to prosecute a war in Mexico\nand to enforce the Fugitive Slave Law. In his essay, Thoreau observes\nthat only a very few people – heroes, martyrs, patriots,\nreformers in the best sense – serve their society with their\nconsciences, and so necessarily resist society for the most part, and\nare commonly treated by it as enemies. Thoreau,\nfor his part, spent time in jail for his protest. Many after him have\nproudly identified their protests as acts of civil disobedience and\nhave been treated by their societies – sometimes temporarily,\nsometimes indefinitely – as its enemies.  Throughout history, acts of civil disobedience famously have\nhelped to force a reassessment of society's moral parameters. The\nBoston Tea Party, the suffragette movement, the resistance to British\nrule in India led by Gandhi, the US civil rights movement led by\nMartin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks and others, the resistance to\napartheid in South Africa, student sit-ins against the Vietnam War,\nthe democracy movement in Myanmar/Burma led by Aung San Suu Kyi, to\nname a few, are all instances where civil disobedience proved to be an\nimportant mechanism for social change. The ultimate impact of more\nrecent acts of civil disobedience – anti-abortion trespass\ndemonstrations or acts of disobedience taken as part of the\nenvironmental movement and animal rights movement – remains to\nbe seen. \n\nCertain features of civil disobedience seem vital not only to its\nimpact on societies and governments, but also to its status as a\npotentially justifiable breach of law. Civil disobedience is generally\nregarded as more morally defensible than both ordinary offences and\nother forms of protest such as militant action or coercive violence.\nBefore contrasting civil disobedience with both ordinary offences and\nother types of protest, attention should be given to the features\nexemplified in the influential cases noted above. These features\ninclude, amongst other things, a conscientious or principled outlook\nand the communication of both condemnation and a desire for change in\nlaw or policy. Other features commonly cited – publicity,\nnon-violence, fidelity to law – will also be considered here\nthough they prove to be less central than is sometimes assumed. The\nsecond part of this section contrasts civil disobedience with ordinary\noffences and the third part contrasts it with legal protest, rule\ndepartures by officials, conscientious objection, radical protest\n(often labelled ‘terrorism’), and revolutionary action. \n\nConscientiousness: This feature, highlighted in almost all\naccounts of civil disobedience, points to the seriousness, sincerity\nand moral conviction with which civil disobedients breach the law. For\nmany disobedients, their breach of law is demanded of them not only by\nself-respect and moral consistency but also by their perception of the\ninterests of their society. Through their disobedience, they draw\nattention to laws or policies that they believe require reassessment or\nrejection. Whether their challenges are well-founded is another matter,\nwhich will be taken up in Section 2. \n\nOn Rawls's account of civil disobedience, in a nearly just society,\ncivil disobedients address themselves to the majority to show that, in\ntheir considered opinion, the principles of justice governing\ncooperation amongst free and equal persons have not been respected by\npolicymakers. Rawls's restriction of civil disobedience to breaches\nthat defend the principles of justice may be criticised for its\nnarrowness since, presumably, a wide range of legitimate values not\nwholly reducible to justice, such as transparency, security,\nstability, privacy, integrity, and autonomy, could motivate people to\nengage in civil disobedience. However, Rawls does allow that\nconsiderations arising from people's comprehensive moral outlooks may\nbe offered in the public sphere provided that, in due course, people\npresent public reasons, given by a reasonable political conception of\njustice, sufficient to support whatever their comprehensive doctrines\nwere introduced to support (Rawls 1996). Rawls's proviso grants that\npeople often engage in the public sphere for a variety of reasons; so\neven when justice figures prominently in a person's decision to use\ncivil disobedience, other considerations could legitimately contribute\nto her decision to act. The activism of Martin Luther King Jr. is a\ncase in point. King was motivated by his religious convictions and his\ncommitments to democracy, equality, and justice to undertake protests\nsuch as the Montgomery bus boycott. Rawls maintains that, while he\ndoes not know whether King thought of himself as fulfilling the\npurpose of the proviso, King could have fulfilled it; and had he\naccepted public reason he certainly would have fulfilled it. Thus, on\nRawls's view, King's activism is civil disobedience. \n\nSince people can undertake political protest for a variety of\nreasons, civil disobedience sometimes overlaps with other forms of\ndissent. A US draft-dodger during the Vietnam War might be said to\ncombine civil disobedience and conscientious objection in the same\naction. And, most famously, Gandhi may be credited with combining civil\ndisobedience with revolutionary action. That said, despite the potential for\noverlap, some broad distinctions may be drawn between civil\ndisobedience and other forms of protest in terms of the scope of the\naction and agents' motivations (Section 1.3). \n\nCommunication: In civilly disobeying the law, a person\ntypically has both forward-looking and backward-looking aims. She seeks\nnot only to convey her disavowal and condemnation of a certain law or\npolicy, but also to draw public attention to this particular issue and\nthereby to instigate a change in law or policy. A parallel may be drawn\nbetween the communicative aspect of civil disobedience and the\ncommunicative aspect of lawful punishment by the state (Brownlee 2012;\n2004). Like civil disobedience, lawful punishment is associated with a\nbackward-looking aim to demonstrate condemnation of certain conduct as\nwell as a forward-looking aim to bring about a lasting change in that\nconduct. The forward and backward-looking aims of punishment apply not\nonly to the particular offence in question, but also to the kind of\nconduct of which this offence is an example. \n\nThere is some dispute over the kinds of policies that civil\ndisobedients may target through their breach of law. Some exclude from\nthe class of civilly disobedient acts those breaches of law that\nprotest the decisions of private agents such as trade unions, banks,\nprivate universities, etc. (Raz 1979, 264). Others, by contrast,\nmaintain that disobedience in opposition to the decisions of private\nagents can reflect a larger challenge to the legal system that permits\nthose decisions to be taken, which makes it appropriate to place this\ndisobedience under the umbrella of civil disobedience (Brownlee 2012;\n2007). There is more agreement amongst thinkers that civil\ndisobedience can be either direct or indirect. In other words, civil\ndisobedients can either breach the law they oppose or breach a law\nwhich, other things being equal, they do not oppose in order to\ndemonstrate their protest against another law or policy. Trespassing\non a military base to spray-paint nuclear missile silos in protest\nagainst current military policy would be an example of indirect civil\ndisobedience. It is worth noting that the distinction often drawn\nbetween direct civil disobedience and indirect civil disobedience is\nless clear-cut than generally assumed. For example, refusing to pay\ntaxes that support the military could be seen as either indirect or\ndirect civil disobedience against military policy. Although this act\ntypically would be classified as indirect disobedience, a part of\none's taxes, in this case, would have gone directly to support the\npolicy one opposes. \n\nPublicity: The feature of communication may be contrasted\nwith that of publicity. The latter is endorsed by Rawls who argues that\ncivil disobedience is never covert or secretive; it is only ever\ncommitted in public, openly, and with fair notice to legal authorities\n(Rawls 1971, 366). Hugo A. Bedau adds to this that usually it is\nessential to the dissenter's purpose that both the government and\nthe public know what she intends to do (Bedau 1961, 655). However,\nalthough sometimes advance warning may be essential to a\ndissenter's strategy, this is not always the case. As noted at\nthe outset, publicity sometimes detracts from or undermines the attempt\nto communicate through civil disobedience. If a person publicises her\nintention to breach the law, then she provides both political opponents\nand legal authorities with the opportunity to abort her efforts to\ncommunicate (Smart 1991, 206). For this reason, unannounced or\n(initially) covert disobedience is sometimes preferable to actions\nundertaken publicly and with fair warning. Examples include releasing\nanimals from research laboratories or vandalising military property; to\nsucceed in carrying out these actions, disobedients would have to avoid\npublicity of the kind Rawls defends. Such acts of civil disobedience\nnonetheless may be regarded as ‘open’ when followed soon\nafter by an acknowledgment of the act and the reasons for acting.\nOpenness and publicity, even at the cost of having one's protest\nfrustrated, offer ways for disobedients to show their willingness to\ndeal fairly with authorities. \n\nNon-violence: A controversial issue in debates on civil\ndisobedience is non-violence. Like publicity, non-violence is said to\ndiminish the negative effects of breaching the law. Some theorists go\nfurther and say that civil disobedience is, by definition, non-violent.\nAccording to Rawls, violent acts likely to injure are incompatible with\ncivil disobedience as a mode of address. ‘Indeed’, says\nRawls, ‘any interference with the civil liberties of others tends\nto obscure the civilly disobedient quality of one's\nact’ (Rawls 1971, 366). \n\nEven though paradigmatic disobedients like Gandhi and Martin Luther\nKing Jr embody Rawls's image of non-violent direct action,\nopponents of Rawls's view have challenged the centrality of\nnon-violence for civil disobedience on several fronts. First, there is\nthe problem of specifying an appropriate notion of violence.\nIt is unclear, for example, whether violence to self, violence to\nproperty, or minor violence against others (such as a vicious pinch)\nshould be included in a conception of the relevant kinds of violence.\nIf the significant criterion for a commonsense notion of a violent act\nis a likelihood of causing injury, however minor, then these kinds of\nacts count as acts of violence (see Morreall 1991). Second,\nnon-violent acts or legal acts sometimes cause more harm to others than\ndo violent acts (Raz 1979, 267). A legal strike by ambulance workers\nmay well have much more severe consequences than minor acts of\nvandalism. Third, violence, depending on its form, does not\nnecessarily obscure the communicative quality of a disobedient's\naction as Rawls and Peter Singer suggests it does (Singer 1973, 86).\nLimited violence used to achieve a specific objective might heighten\nthe communicative quality of the act by drawing greater attention to\nthe dissenter's cause and by emphasising her seriousness and\nfrustration. \n\nThese observations do not alter the fact that non-violent dissent\nnormally is preferable to violent dissent. As Raz observes,\nnon-violence avoids the direct harm caused by violence, and\nnon-violence does not encourage violence in other situations where\nviolence would be wrong, something which an otherwise warranted use of\nviolence may do. Moreover, as a matter of prudence, non-violence does\nnot carry the same risk of antagonising potential allies or confirming\nthe antipathy of opponents (Raz 1979, 267). Furthermore, non-violence\ndoes not distract the attention of the public, and it probably denies\nauthorities an excuse to use violent countermeasures against\ndisobedients. \n\nNon-violence, publicity and a willingness to accept punishment are\noften regarded as marks of disobedients' fidelity to the legal\nsystem in which they carry out their protest. Those who deny that these\nfeatures are definitive of civil disobedience endorse a more inclusive\nconception according to which civil disobedience involves a\nconscientious and communicative breach of law designed to demonstrate\ncondemnation of a law or policy and to contribute to a change in that\nlaw or policy. Such a conception allows that civil disobedience can be\nviolent, partially covert, and revolutionary. This conception also\naccommodates vagaries in the practice and justifiability of civil\ndisobedience for different political contexts: it grants that the\nappropriate model of how civil disobedience works in a context such as\napartheid South Africa may differ from the model that applies to a\nwell-ordered, liberal, just democracy. An even broader conception of\ncivil disobedience would draw no clear boundaries between civil\ndisobedience and other forms of protest such as conscientious\nobjection, forcible resistance, and revolutionary action. A\ndisadvantage of this last conception is that it blurs the lines between\nthese different types of protest and so might both weaken claims about\nthe defensibility of civil disobedience and invite authorities and\nopponents of civil disobedience to lump all illegal protest under one\numbrella. \n\nIn democratic societies, civil disobedience as such is not a crime.\nIf a disobedient is punished by the law, it is not for civil\ndisobedience, but for the recognised offences she commits, such as\nblocking a road or disturbing the peace, or trespassing, or damaging\nproperty, etc. Therefore, if judges are persuaded, as they sometimes\nare, either not to punish a disobedient or to punish her differently\nfrom other people who breach the same laws, it must be on the basis of\nsome feature or features of her action which distinguish it from the\nacts of ordinary offenders. \n\nTypically a person who commits an offence has no wish to communicate\nwith her government or society. This is evinced by the fact that\nusually an offender does not intend to make it known that she has\nbreached the law. Since, in most cases, she wishes to benefit or, at\nleast, not to suffer from her unlawful action, it is in her interests\nto preserve the secrecy of her conduct. An exception might be where a\nperson's breach is sufficiently minor, such as jaywalking, that\nconcealment is unnecessary since sanction is unlikely to follow.\nAnother exception might be where a person wishes to thumb her nose at\nauthorities by advertising that she has committed a crime. By making an\nexception of herself and by distancing herself from a legal rule, this\nordinary offender communicates a certain disregard for the law. This\ncommunication, however, does not normally reflect an aim either to\ndemonstrate conscientiously held objections to that law or to lead\nsociety to reform the law. Civil disobedients, by contrast, seek to\nmake their disobedience known to specific members of the community\neither before or after the fact to demonstrate both the seriousness of\ntheir condemnation of that law or policy and their sincere desire for\npolicy change. The difference in communication between the civil\ndisobedient and the ordinary offender reflects a deeper difference in\nmotivation for breaching the law (Brownlee 2012). \n\nA further difference between civil disobedience and common crimes\npertains to the willingness of the offender to accept the legal\nconsequences. The willingness of disobedients to accept punishment is\ntaken not only as a mark of (general) fidelity to the law, but also as\nan assertion that they differ from ordinary offenders. Accepting\npunishment also can have great strategic value, as Martin Luther King\nJr observes: ‘If you confront a man who has been cruelly misusing\nyou, and say “Punish me, if you will; I do not deserve it, but I\nwill accept it, so that the world will know I am right and you are\nwrong,” then you wield a powerful and just weapon’\n(Washington 1991, 348). Moreover, like non-violence, a willingness to\naccept the legal consequences normally is preferable, and often has a\npositive impact on the disobedient's cause. This willingness\nmay make the majority realise that what is for them a matter of\nindifference is for disobedients a matter of great importance (Singer\n1973, 84). Similarly, it may demonstrate the purity or selflessness of\nthe disobedient's motives or serve as a means to mobilise more\nbroad-based support (Raz 1979, 265). And yet, punishment can also be\ndetrimental to dissenters' efforts by compromising future\nattempts to assist others through protest (Greenawalt 1987, 239).\nFurthermore, the link between a willingness to accept punishment and\nrespect for law can be pulled apart. A revolutionary like Gandhi was\nhappy to go to jail for his offences, but felt no fidelity toward the\nparticular legal system in which he acted. \n\nAlthough civil disobedience often overlaps broadly with other types\nof dissent, nevertheless some rough distinctions may be drawn between\nthe key features of civil disobedience and the key features of these\nother practices. \n\nLegal Protest: The obvious difference between legal protest\nand civil disobedience is that the former lies within the bounds of the\nlaw, but the latter does not. Most of the other features exemplified in\ncivil disobedience can be found in legal protest including a\nconscientious and communicative demonstration of protest, a desire to\nbring about through moral dialogue some lasting change in policy or\nprinciple, an attempt to educate and to raise awareness, and so on. The\ndifference in legality translates into a more significant, moral\ndifference when placed against the backdrop of a general moral\nobligation to follow the law. If it is morally wrong to breach the law,\nthen special justification is required for civil disobedience which is\nnot required for legal protest. However, the political regime in which\nobedience is demanded may be relevant here. David Lyons maintains that\nthe Jim Crow laws (racial segregation laws in force in the southern US\nuntil 1964), British colonial rule in India, and chattel slavery in\nantebellum America offer three refutations of the view that civil\ndisobedience requires moral justification in morally objectionable\nregimes. According to Lyons, there can be no moral presumption in\nfavour of obedience to the law in such regimes, and therefore no moral\njustification is required for civil disobedience. ‘Insofar as\ncivil disobedience theory assumes that political resistance requires\nmoral justification even in settings that are morally comparable to Jim\nCrow,’ says Lyons, ‘it is premised on serious moral\nerror’ (Lyons 1998, 39). If one takes the view that there is no\ngeneral moral obligation to follow the law (irrespective of regime),\nthen both adherence to the law and breach of law must be judged not on\ntheir legality, but on their character and consequences. And this would\nmean that, even in morally reprehensible regimes, justification may be\ndemanded for civil disobedience that either has significant negative\nconsequences or falls below certain moral standards. \n\nAlthough questions of justification will be addressed more fully in\nthe next section, it is worth noting here one point in favour of civil\ndisobedience over legal protest. As Bertrand Russell observes,\ntypically it is difficult to make the most salient facts in a dispute\nknown through conventional channels of participation. The controllers\nof mainstream media tend to give defenders of unpopular views limited\nspace to make their case. Given the sensational news value of illegal\nmethods, however, engaging in civil disobedience often leads to wide\ndissemination of a position (Russell 1998, 635). John Stuart\nMill observes, with regard to dissent in general, that sometimes the\nonly way to make a view heard is to allow, or even to invite, society\nto ridicule and sensationalise it as intemperate and irrational (Mill\n1999). Admittedly, the success of this strategy depends partly on the\ncharacter of the society in which it is employed; but it should not be\nruled out as a strategy for communication. \n\nRule Departures: A practice distinct from, but related to,\ncivil disobedience is rule departure on the part of authorities. Rule\ndeparture is essentially the deliberate decision by an official, for\nconscientious reasons, not to discharge the duties of her office\n(Feinberg 1979). It may involve a decision by police not to arrest\noffenders (cf. Smith 2012) or a decision by prosecutors not to\nproceed to trial, or a decision by a jury or by a judge to acquit an\nobviously guilty person.  Whether these conscientious acts actually\ncontravene the general duties of the office is debatable. If an\nofficial's breach of a specific duty is more in keeping with the\nspirit and overall aims of the office than a painstaking respect for\nits particular duties is, then the former might be said to adhere\nbetter than the latter does to the demands of the office (Greenawalt\n1987, 281) \n\nRule departures resemble civil disobedience in that both involve\ndissociation from and condemnation of certain policies and practices.\nMoreover, both are communicative, though their audiences may differ.\nThe official who departs from the rules of her office addresses her\naction principally to the individuals or groups whom she intends to\nassist through her breach of a specific duty. Her action demonstrates\nto these parties both that she disagrees with a policy that would treat\nthem in a certain way and that her actions align with her commitments.\nWhere civil disobedience and rule departure differ is, first, in the\nidentity of their practitioners. Whereas rule departure typically is an\naction taken by an agent of the state (including juries), civil\ndisobedience typically is an action taken by citizens (including\nofficials acting as ordinary citizens and not in the capacity of their\nofficial role). Second these practices differ in their legality.\nWhether rule departure actually involves a breach of law is unclear.\nCivil disobedience, by contrast, involves the breach of a law currently\non the books. A third difference between rule departure and civil\ndisobedience is that, unlike civil disobedience, rule departure does\nnot usually expose those who employ it to the risks of sanction or\npunishment (Feinberg 1979) \n\nConscientious Objection: This kind of protest may be\nunderstood as a violation of the law motivated by the dissenter's\nbelief that she is morally prohibited to follow the law because the law\nis either bad or wrong, totally or in part. The conscientious objector\nmay believe, for example, that the general character of the law in\nquestion is morally wrong (as an absolute pacifist would believe of\nconscription), or that the law extends to certain cases which it should\nnot cover (an orthodox Christian would regard euthanasia as murder)\n(Raz 1979, 263). While commonly taken to refer to pacifist objections\nto military service, conscientious objection, says Raz, may apply to\nany law, negative or positive, that a person believes for moral reasons\nshe is compelled to disobey. A narrower conception of conscientious\nobjection, described as conscientious refusal, characterises this kind\nof disobedience as non-compliance with a more or less direct legal\ninjunction or administrative order (Rawls 1971, 368). Examples would\nbe the refusal of Jehovah's Witnesses to salute the flag or\nThoreau's refusal to pay his taxes (it is interesting that the\naction of the man who coined the term ‘civil disobedience’\nis regarded by many as lying at the periphery of what counts as civil\ndisobedience). Whereas conscientious refusal is undertaken with the\nassumption that authorities are aware of the breach of law,\nconscientious evasion is undertaken with the assumption that the breach\nof law is wholly covert. The devout person who continues to practice\nher religion in secret after it has been banned does not protest\nagainst the law, but breaches it covertly for moral reasons. The\npersonal nature of this disobedience commands respect, as it suggests\nmodesty and reflection, which more vocal and confident displays of\nconviction may lack. \n\nThe differences between civil disobedience and conscientious evasion\nare easier to identify than those between civil disobedience and\nconscientious refusal or conscientious objection. Although\nconscientious objection typically is not characterised by the aim to\ncommunicate to government and society either that a law has been\nbreached or the reasons behind the breach, nevertheless many acts\ncommonly classified as conscientious objection – tax avoidance\nand resistance to conscription – have a public or communicative\ncomponent. Moreover, when such actions are taken by many people their\ncollective impact can approximate the kind of communicative protest\nexemplified in civil disobedience. \n\nA more obvious difference between civil disobedience and\nconscientious objection is that, whereas the former is invariably\nillegal, sometimes the latter is legal. In the context of military\nconscription, some legal systems regard conscientious objection as a\nlegitimate ground for avoiding frontline military service. \n\nRadical Protest: Some forms of dissent such as coercive\nviolence, organised forcible resistance, militant action,\nintimidation, and terrorisation lie further outside the realm of\ntolerated (or tolerable) political action than civil disobedience\ndoes. There are reasons to avoid labelling such disobedience (or\nanything else) as ‘terrorism’. Not only is the term\n‘terrorism’ inflammatory, but also it is bandied\nabout by governments to capture an overly broad range of\nactions. Whereas ‘civil disobedience’ has developed as a\npositive term which many people apply to their own protests,\n‘terrorism’ is an epithet applied only to the actions of\nothers. Given the highly negative connotations of this term, its\n(philosophical) usefulness is questionable. Less loaded notions of\nintimidation, terrorisation, forcible resistance, and severe violence\noffer greater space for a proper analysis of the justifiability of\nusing such measures in political protest. \n\nWhile a civil disobedient does not necessarily oppose the regime in\nwhich she acts, the militant or radical protester is deeply opposed to\nthat regime (or a core aspect of that regime). This protester uses\nmodes of communication unlikely to persuade others of the merits of her\nposition. Her aims are more urgent and extreme than those of the civil\ndisobedient; she seeks rapid change through brutal strategies of\ncoercion and intimidation, not through strategies of persuasion and\nmoral appeal. And often her action includes force or extreme violence\nas a key component. Given the nature of her conduct and objectives, she\nis likely to try to evade the legal consequences of her action. This is\nless often the case for civil disobedients. \n\nRevolutionary Action: The difference between radical\nprotest and revolutionary action may be as difficult to specify as that\nbetween revolutionary action and civil disobedience. One point of\ndifference amongst the three concerns the nature of the objectives.\nActs of civil disobedience often have focused and limited objectives.\nActs of terrorisation or large-scale coercive violence are typically\nassociated with a general aim of generating fear and insecurity while\nkeeping any specific aims or demands oblique. Revolutionary action is\ntypified by a comprehensive objective to bring about a regime change.\nBoth acts of radical protest and acts of civil disobedience can of\ncourse fall within a revolutionary project, and may even coincide with\neach other (as they perhaps did in the sabotage strategies used by\nNelson Mandela and the African National Congress). \n\nAs a general practice, revolution, like radical protest, does not\nseek to persuade the government to change established policies. But,\nunlike much radical protest, revolutionary action may seek to persuade\nthe society under that government that a change in regime is required.\nIf revolutionaries seek to persuade the government of anything, it is\nthat it should cease to be the government. In India, Gandhi had some\nsuccess in this project. Once the movement became irresistible, the\nBritish left India fairly peacefully. But Gandhi's revolutionary\nproject may be contrasted with other revolutions such as the French\nrevolution, or even the South African revolution, where there were\nendorsements of revolutionary terror. Large-scale resistance that\nincorporates terrorisation is quite a different enterprise from the\nnon-violent resistance that distinguished Gandhi's\nprotest.  Since, as noted above, people may engage in dissent for\nnumerous reasons, acts of civil disobedience like Gandhi's that\nare guided by conscientious commitments can also be driven by\nrevolutionary aims. \n\nThe various points of contact and overlap amongst different types of\npolitical protest suggest that there is no one-dimensional continuum\nfrom weak to strong dissent. There is more plausibility in the idea of\na multi-dimensional continuum of protest, which recognises the\ncomplexities in such critical points of contrast as legality, violence,\nharm, communication, motivation, and persuasiveness. \n\nOn many views, an analysis of the justifiability of civil\ndisobedience must consider not only the dissenter's particular\naction and its likely consequences, but also her motivation for\nengaging in this act of civil disobedience. Factors relevant to a\ndisobedient's choice of action include: its illegality, its use\nas a last resort or first resort, any coordination with other\ndissenters, the likelihood of success, the directness or indirectness\nof the action, and the expected harm. Factors relevant to motivation\ninclude: the merit or lack thereof in the dissenter's cause, her\nreasons for defending that cause, and her reasons for engaging in this\nform of protest. Although they are examined separately below, these two\nsets of factors inevitably overlap. \n\nThe task of defending civil disobedience is commonly undertaken with\nthe assumption that in reasonably just, liberal societies people have a\ngeneral moral obligation to follow the law. In the history of\nphilosophy, many arguments have been given for legal obligation (often\ncalled ‘political obligation’). Plato's Socrates, in\nthe Crito, offers at least two lines of argument for legal\nobligation in order to defend his decision not to escape from prison.\nFirst, Socrates emphasises the importance of moral consistency; he\nwould prefer to give up his life than to compromise his principles. A\nbasic principle for Socrates is that a person must never do wrong or\ninjury in return for wrong. To escape without persuading the state\nwould be to try to destroy it and its laws. Second, Socrates maintains\nthat he has an obligation to follow the laws of Athens since he has\ntacitly agreed to do so and since he enjoys the rights and benefits of\ncitizenship. This voluntarist line of argument is also espoused later\nby John Locke, who argues that we have a duty to follow the law only\nwhen we have consented to its rule. This view contrasts with the\nnon-voluntarist position of David Hume, according to which the\nobligation to follow the law is rooted in the value of government under\nlaw. From these two traditions rise the principal contemporary\narguments for legal obligation, which concern respectively consent,\ngratitude, promise-keeping, fairness, necessary institutions, and\npublic good. Many of the contemporary voluntarist and non-voluntarist\narguments have been criticised in recent debates, giving rise to the\nview that, while there are both ordinary reasons to follow the law and\nstrong moral obligations to follow particular laws, there is no general\nmoral obligation to follow the law. One reason to think there is no\nsuch obligation is that the legality of an action does not\nsignificantly affect its moral status (Smith 1973). The claim is that\njaywalking across an empty street, for example, is hardly reprehensible\nand its illegality does not make it more reprehensible. Similarly,\nspitting at someone's feet or refusing without cause to\nacknowledge that person is reprehensible and its legality does not\ndiminish that. \n\nOn the assumption that people have a pro tanto obligation\nto follow the law (or at least those laws that are not excessively\nunjust), it follows that people then have a pro tanto\nobligation to use the proper legal channels of political participation\nbefore resorting to illegal methods. On this view, civil disobedience\ncan be justified only when employed as a last resort. But since causes\ndefended by a minority are often those most opposed by persons in\npower, legal channels may be less than wholly effective. Moreover, it\nis unclear when a person could claim to have reached the situation of\nlast resort; she could continue to use the same tired legal methods\nwithout end. To ward off such challenges, Rawls suggests that, if past\nactions have shown the majority to be immovable or apathetic, then\nfurther attempts may reasonably be thought fruitless and one may be\nconfident one's civil disobedience is a last resort. \n\nAnother condition for civil disobedience to be justified, according\nto Rawls, is that disobedients coordinate with other minorities. Since\nminority groups are equally justified in resorting to civil\ndisobedience when they have sufficiently weighty objections, these\ngroups should avoid undermining each others' efforts through\nsimultaneous appeals to the attention of society and government. Some\ncoordination of activities is required, says Rawls, to regulate the\noverall level of dissent (Rawls 1971, 374–5). While there is some\nmerit to this condition, civil disobedience that does not meet it might\nstill be justifiable. In some cases, there will be no time or\nopportunity to coordinate with other minorities. And in other cases,\nother minority groups may be unable or unwilling to coordinate. It is\nan open question then whether the refusal or inability of other groups\nto cooperate should affect the ultimate defensibility of a\nperson's decision to engage in civil disobedience. \n\nA reason for Rawls to defend this coordination requirement is that,\nin most cases, it serves a more important concern, namely, the\nachievement of good consequences. It is often argued that civil\ndisobedience can only be justified if there is a high probability of\nproducing positive change through that disobedience. Only this can\njustify exposing one's society to the risk of harm. The harms usually\nidentified with civil disobedience are as follows. First, civil\ndisobedience can be a divisive force in society. Second, since civil\ndisobedience is normally designed to attract public attention, it can\nlead people, as a result, to think of resorting to disobedience to\nachieve whatever changes in law or policy they find justified (Raz\n1979, 262). Third, civil disobedience can encourage more than just\nother civil disobedience; it can encourage a general disrespect for the\nlaw, particularly where the law is perceived as being lenient toward\ncertain kinds of offences. \n\nIn response to these challenges, one might question the empirical\nclaims that civil disobedience is divisive and that it has the\nconsequence of leading others to use disobedience to achieve changes in\npolicy. One might also question whether it necessarily would be a\nbad thing if civil disobedience had these consequences. Concerning\nlikelihood of success, civil disobedience actually can seem most\njustifiable when the situation appears hopeless and when the government\nrefuses to listen to conventional forms of communication. Additionally,\neven when general success seems unlikely, civil disobedience might be\ndefended for any reprieve from harm that it brings to victims of a bad\nlaw or policy. Tree-hugging, for example, can delay or curtail a\nclear-cut logging scheme and thereby prolong the protection of an\neco-system. \n\nTwo final factors concerning a disobedient's choice of action\nare non-violence and directness. Many theorists regard non-violence as\nnecessary to the justifiability of civil disobedience. But, as noted\nearlier, there can be good reasons to prefer strategic use of violence\nin civil disobedience to the harm and injustice of the law. Sometimes\nthe wrong that a dissenter perceives may be so iniquitous that it is\nright to use violence to root it out. Such violence may be necessary to\npreserve or to re-establish the rights and civil liberties that\ncoercive practices seek to suspend (Raz 1979). Concerning directness,\nsome argue that civil disobedience is more justifiable the more direct\nit is since direct disobedience targets the specific legal wrong that\nprompted it (Greenawalt 1987, 235). While directness may ensure that\nthe objective of the dissent is understood, it has disadvantages; and\nin some contexts direct action cannot be justified. When direct\ndisobedience would fail to treat others with respect or would cause far\ngreater harm than either adherence to the law or indirect disobedience\nwould cause, then indirect disobedience has a greater claim to\njustification. But, when indirect civil disobedience would be either\nmisconstrued or viewed in isolation from the law opposed, then direct\ndisobedience, assuming it meets certain moral requirements (which are\ndetermined by the content of the law opposed), may have greater\njustification. People who use indirect disobedience have, other things\nbeing equal, no objective reasons to breach the law that they breach.\nThis means that the justification for their disobedience must turn\nsolely on the value of that action as the appropriate vehicle through\nwhich to communicate their objection. \n\nAs a vehicle for communication, civil disobedience has much to be\nsaid for it. It was noted in Section 1.3 that civil disobedience can\noften better contribute to a dialogue with society and the state than\nlegal protest can since controllers of mainstream media tend not to\ngive unpopular views a hearing unless they are advocated through\nsensational means such as illegal protest. But, as the above points\nhave indicated, the justifiability of an act of civil disobedience\ndepends greatly on its specific features. Civil disobedience\nsometimes serves primarily to inform and to educate the public about an\nissue. But other times, it acts by confronting the majority with the\nhigher costs of retaining a given law or policy in the face of\ncontinued, concerted opposition. The nature of these strategies and, as\ndiscussed below, the motivations for selecting one over another inform\nan analysis of justifiability. \n\nOn many views, for an act of civil disobedience to be justified, it\nis insufficient that the dissenter's act meet criteria such as\nthose noted above. It is equally important that she choose that action\nfor the right reasons. The first requirement she must satisfy is that\nher cause be well-founded. A dissenter may believe that her cause is\njust and that her disobedience is morally permissible, but she might be\nmistaken either about the facts or about her principles. Assuming her\nchallenge is well-founded, there are two further issues. The first\npertains to her reasons for supporting this cause. The second pertains\nto her reasons for taking this particular act of disobedience. \n\nConcerning the former, if a person advocates a legitimate cause such\nas equal rights for black Americans simply for the reason that she\nseeks re-election or promotion or the admiration of friends while\nhaving no real sympathy for this cause, then she acts not for decisive\nreasons. To be fully justified in her defence of this cause, she must\nact on the basis of good reasons to support equality amongst peoples;\nsuch reasons could include her sense of injustice for the ill-treatment\nof black Americans or her respect for the dignity of persons or her\nappreciation that real equality of rights best serves the interests of\nall American people. It would be appropriate to judge negatively the\ncharacter of a person who was improperly motivated to take praiseworthy\naction in defence of others' rights. \n\nConcerning the latter, sometimes reasons apply to a situation but do\nnot favour the particular action that a person takes. When deciding how\nbest to defend a legitimate cause, a person must give thought to the\nappropriate strategy to adopt. A person may have reasons for engaging\nin one form of disobedience, but choose to engage in another form that\nis not supported by these reasons. For example, she may have an\nundefeated reason to participate in a road block because this action is\nwell suited to her political concerns and is one that her government\nunderstands and responds well to or because this action has a public\nimpact that does not greatly harm the interests of others; but, she has\nno undefeated reason, say, to trespass on government property or to\nengage in vandalism. In taking the latter actions, she is guilty of a\ncertain error of judgment about which actions are supported by reasons\nthat admittedly apply (See Gardner and Macklem 2002). Given her error,\nthe best she could claim is that her conduct is excused, as she had\nreason to believe that she had reason to undertake that particular form\nof civil disobedience. When, by contrast, a person's civilly\ndisobedient action is supported by undefeated reasons that apply to her\nsituation then her choice of action is justified. The justification for\nher action stems from its appropriateness as the action to take. Its\nappropriateness is structured in part by the political regime, the tone\nof the social environment, the actions taken by other political\nparticipants, and so on. All of these factors bear on the\nappropriateness of a given action and the manner in which it is\nperformed, and thus determine to what extent the reasons that support\nit provide a justification. \n\nThe various constraints and requirements discussed above do not\namount to a complete defence for civil disobedience. A fuller defence\nwould appeal to the social value of civil disobedience. Justified civil\ndisobedience, says Rawls, can serve to inhibit departures from justice\nand to correct departures when they occur; thus it can act as a\nstabilising force in society (Rawls 1971, 383). Justice aside, civil\ndisobedience and dissent more generally contribute to the democratic\nexchange of ideas by forcing the champions of dominant opinion to\ndefend their views. Mill maintains in On Liberty that if there\nare any persons who contest a received opinion, we should thank them\nfor it, open our minds to listen to them, and rejoice that there is\nsomeone to do for us what we otherwise ought to do ourselves (Mill\n1999, 90). In fact, one could argue that those who breach the law in\njustified civil disobedience demonstrate responsible citizenship or\ncivic virtue. Richard Dagger argues that \n\nThis view of dissent and justified civil disobedience aligns with an\nincreasingly common perception that our responsibilities as citizens\ngo well beyond any obligation to follow the law. Indeed, under certain\nconditions, our obligations are to resist unjust and unfair schemes,\nand this can include a duty to disobey the law (Delmas 2014).  \n\nAn issue associated with, but distinct from, that of justification is\nwhether people have a right to engage in civil disobedience. Most\nthinkers who have considered civil disobedience defend a limited right\nto such protest. Rawls, for example, maintains that, even in a nearly\njust society, a person may be supposed to have a right to engage in\ncivil disobedience when three conditions are met. These are the\nconditions he sets for justified civil disobedience: it is undertaken\n1) in response to an instance of substantial and clear injustice, 2)\nas a last resort and 3) in coordination with other minority groups.\nRawls's approach has been criticised for not clearly\ndistinguishing his account of justified civil disobedience from an\naccount of the disobedience which people have a right to take. There\nis much disagreement over the kinds of actions that can be captured by\nrights. Some theorists, such as John Mackie, argue that there can be no\nright to perform a morally wrong action since wrong actions are acts\nwe are morally required not to perform (Mackie 1978). Others, such as\nRaz, argue that to restrict rights to morally right actions is to\nmisunderstand the nature of rights. Rights of conduct protect a\ncertain sphere of autonomy and liberty for the agent with which\ninterference by others is restricted, that is to say, rights of\nconduct imply that interference with that conduct is unjustified even\nwhen the conduct is itself unjustified. One does not require a right,\nRaz observes, to do the right thing. But one often does require a\nright to do what one should not do (cf. Waldron 1981). On this view,\nthe limits of the right to political participation, for example, are\nset not by the nature of people's political objectives, but by\nthe form of the actions they employ to realise those objectives. \n\nAccording to Raz, when one considers the idea of a moral right to\ncivil disobedience, one must appreciate that this right extends to\ncases in which people should not exercise it. To say that there is a\nright to civil disobedience is to allow the legitimacy of resorting to\nthis form of political action to one's political opponents. It is\nto allow that the legitimacy of civil disobedience does not depend on\nthe rightness of one's cause (Raz 1979, 268). \n\nIn his account of a right to civil disobedience, Raz places great\nemphasis on the kind of regime in which a disobedient acts. Raz\nargues that only in an illiberal regime do certain individuals have a\nright to civil disobedience. \n\nBy contrast, in a liberal state, Raz argues, a person's right to\npolitical activity is, by hypothesis, adequately protected by law.\nTherefore, in such a regime, the right to political participation\ncannot ground a right to civil disobedience. \n\nAgainst Raz, one could argue, as David Lefkowitz does, that when a\nperson appeals to political participation rights to defend her\ndisobedience she does not necessarily criticise the law for outlawing\nher action. Lefkowitz maintains that members of minorities can\nappreciate that democratic discussions often must be cut short so that\ndecisions may be taken. As such, persons who engage in political\ndisobedience may view current policy as the best compromise between\nthe need to act and the need to accommodate continued\ndebate. Nonetheless, they also can observe that, with greater\nresources or further time for debate, their view might have held\nsway. Given this possibility, the right to political participation\nmust include a right to continue to contest the result after the votes\nare counted or the decisions taken. And this right should include\nsuitably constrained civil disobedience because the best conception of\npolitical participation rights is one that reduces as much as possible\nthe impact that luck has on the popularity of a view (Lefkowitz\n2007; see also Ceva 2015). \n\nAn alternative response to Raz questions whether the right to civil\ndisobedience must be derived from rights to political\nparticipation. Briefly, the right to civil disobedience could be\ngrounded on something other than participation rights such as a\nright to object on the basis of conscience. Whether such a right to\nconscience would fall under participation rights depends on the\nexpansiveness of the latter rights. When the right to participate is\nunderstood to accommodate only legal protest, then the right\nconscientiously to object, which commonsensically includes civil\ndisobedience, must be viewed as distinct from political participation\nrights. \n\nA further challenge to Raz might be that real societies do not align\nwith this dichotomy between liberal and illiberal regimes; rather they\nfall along a spectrum of liberality and illiberality, being both more\nor less liberal relative to each other and being more or less liberal\nin some domains than in others. Given the stringency of Raz's\nnotion of a liberal regime, it is unlikely that any society could be\nwholly liberal. So, although Raz may have grounds to hold that in the\ntruly liberal society a right to civil disobedience would not exist and\nthat, to the extent that our society approximates such a regime, the\ncase for such a right diminishes, nevertheless in the majority of real\nsocieties, if not all real societies, a right to civil disobedience\ndoes exist. Note that to make legally protected participation fully\nadequate, the liberal society would have to address Russell's\ncharge that controllers of the media give defenders of unpopular views\nfew opportunities to make their case unless they resort to sensational\nmethods such as disobedience. \n\nRonald Dworkin rests the right to civil disobedience not just on a\nperson's right to political participation, but on all of the\nrights that she has against her government. People may be supposed to\nhave a fundamental right against the government, such as freedom of\nexpression, when that right is important to their dignity, to their\nstanding as persons equally entitled to concern and respect, or to some\nother personal value of consequence. A person has a right to disobey a\nlaw, says Dworkin, whenever that law wrongly invades her rights against\nthe government (Dworkin 1977, 192). Thus, the moral right to breach\nthe law is not a separate right, like a right of conscience, additional\nto other rights against the government. It is that part of\npeople's rights against the government which the government fails\nto honour. \n\nTogether the three above positions bring out some key points of\ndisagreement amongst philosophers on the issue of a right to civil\ndisobedience. First, philosophers disagree over the grounds of this\nright. Is it derivative of a right to participate in the political\ndecision-making process? Is it derivative of other rights? Is it\nfounded on a person's equal status as a being worthy of concern\nand respect? Second, philosophers disagree over the parameters of the\nright. Does it extend to all acts of civil disobedience or only to\nthose acts that meet certain conditions of justifiability? Third,\nphilosophers differ over the kinds of regimes in which the right\narises. Does it exist only in illiberal regimes or does it hold in all\nregimes including just regimes? A final issue, not brought out in any\nof the above views, is whether the right to civil disobedience extends\nto indirect civil disobedience. Presumably, it should, but none of the\nabove positions offer arguments on which one could base such a\nclaim. \n\nThe final issue to consider is how authorities should respond to\ncivil disobedience. The question of appropriate legal response applies,\nfirst, to the actions of law-enforcers when deciding whether and how to\nintervene in a civilly disobedient action, whether to arrest, whether\nto charge, and so on. It applies, second, to the actions of prosecutors\nwhen deciding whether to proceed to trial. Finally, it applies to the\nactions of judges (and juries) when deciding whether to convict and\n(for judges) how much to punish. The focus here will be the issue of\nappropriate punishment. \n\nTo determine when, if ever, punishment of civil disobedience is\nappropriate, it is necessary first to say a few things about the\nnature, purposes, and justification of lawful punishment by the state.\nThe three basic issues of punishment are: Why punish?, Whom to punish?,\nand How much to punish? The justifications for punishment can be\nforward-looking, backward-looking or some combination of the two.\nJeremy Bentham, for one, takes a forward-looking, consequentialist view\nof punishment. He holds that punishment is an evil that is only ever\njustified if its employment prevents some greater evil that would arise\nfrom not punishing (Bentham, 1789, 158). \n\nA key variant of the consequentialist approach focuses on\ndeterrence. Punishment is justified on deterrence grounds if it\nprevents and/or discourages both the offender and others from breaching\nthe law. Deterrence theories are criticised for treating people as\nbrutes not rational agents capable of responding to moral reasons\nbecause the deterrent element of punishment gives people a prudential\nreason (relating to the prospect of punishment), not a moral reason, to\nrefrain from breaching the law. Deterrence theories also are criticised\nfor allowing persons who are not proper objects of punishment to be\npunished when this succeeds in deterring other people from breaching\nthe law. Finally, deterrence theories are criticised for making the\nparameters for appropriate punishment excessively broad in allowing\nthat whatever punishment is needed to deter people is the justified\npunishment. \n\nDesert theory, by contrast, takes a backward-looking view of the\npurpose and justification of punishment, focusing on what the offender\ndeserves for her action. Desert theory is much more concerned than is\ndeterrence theory with punishing only persons who are the proper\nobjects of punishment and with punishing those persons only as much as\nthey deserve. Desert theory aims at a response to the offence that is\nproportionate to its seriousness as an offence. Seriousness is\ndetermined by two factors: an offender's culpability and the harm\ncaused by her action. Desert theories are criticised for insufficiently\ndefending the view that the guilty always should be punished. Although\nthe intuition that the guilty deserve to suffer is widely shared, it is\nnot obvious why they deserve this. Desert theories are also criticised\nfor assuming both that fact-finders can determine what offenders\ndeserve and that the deserved punishment is necessarily the justified\npunishment: should people always be punished as they deserve? \n\nA variant of desert theory is the communicative theory of\npunishment, which takes both a forward-looking and a backward-looking\nview of the purposes of punishment. The purposes of punishment on a\ncommunicative account are both to convey the state's condemnation\nof the action and to lead the offender to repent her action and to\nreform her conduct. On a communicative conception of punishment, the\nstate aims to engage with the offender in a moral dialogue so that she\nappreciates the moral reasons she has to follow the law. According to\nsome communicative theories, condemnation itself sufficiently justifies\npunishment. Punishment may be seen as a secular form of penance that\nvividly confronts the offender with the effects of her crime (Duff\n1998, 162). According to other, less monistic communicative theories,\ncommunication of censure alone is insufficient to justify punishment;\nadded to it must be the aim of deterrence (von Hirsch 1998, 171).\nStill other communicative theories add different considerations to the\ngrounds for justification. On one pluralistic view, a distinction is\ndrawn between the punishment that is deserved according to justice and\nthe punishment that is actually justified. When, for example, an\noffender demonstrates repentance for her offence prior to punishment,\nthe law has reason to be merciful toward her and to impose a less\nsevere punishment than that which she deserves (Tasioulas 2006). Mercy\ninvolves a charitable concern for the well-being of the offender as a\npotential recipient of deserved punishment. Given this offender's\nrepentance, the justified punishment in this case is less than it would\nbe were there no grounds for mercy. \n\nDeterrence systems of punishment recommend a simple approach to\ncivil disobedience. Since the purpose and justification of punishment\nis to deter people from breaching the law, a deterrence system would\nimpose on civil disobedients whatever punishment was necessary and\nsufficient to achieve that end. Whether that punishment would be less\nor more severe than, or equal to, that imposed on ordinary offenders\ndepends on empirical considerations. Sometimes greater punishment than\nthat required for ordinary offenders would be in order since\ndisobedients who are serious in their moral conviction may not be\ndeterred by standard punishments. Other times, however, less punishment\nthan that for ordinary offenders would be in order since disobedients\nusually are not ‘hardened’ criminals and thus may need less\nsevere treatment to deter them from offending. \n\nIn contrast to deterrence systems, monistic desert systems and\ncommunicative systems of punishment would only punish civil\ndisobedients if, and to the extent that, they deserve to be punished. A\npluralistic communicative system, which gives weight to considerations\nof mercy as well as retribution or desert, would only punish to the\nextent that the punishment was justified (not to the extent that it was\ndeserved) since mercy toward the offender might recommend punishing her\nless than she deserves according to justice. The pluralistic approach\nraises the question whether being motivated by civil disobedience might\ngive the law a reason to show mercy towards an offender. One might\nargue that a disobedient's conviction and commitments, which make\nit very difficult for her both to adhere to norms that violate those\ncommitments and to desist from using effective means of protest, are\nfacts about her circumstances that give the law reason to show mercy\ntoward her. This would lessen the severity of any justified response\nfrom the law. \n\nFor desert and communicative theories concerned solely with\njustice-based desert, the key question is whether disobedients deserve\ncensure, and if so, how much? There are at least three possible\nreplies. One is that disobedients deserve the same punishment as the\nordinary offenders who breach the same laws. There are several reasons\nto take this view. First, as Greenawalt puts it, the demands of\nproportionality would seem to recommend a uniform application of legal\nprohibitions. Since trespass is prohibited, persons who breach trespass\nlaws in protest of either those laws or other laws are equally liable\nto persons who breach trespass laws for private purposes. Second, also\nfrom Greenawalt comes the suggestion that any principle that officials\nmay excuse justified illegal acts will result in some failures to\npunish unjustified acts, for which the purposes of punishment would be\nmore fully served. Even when officials make correct judgments about\nwhich acts to excuse, citizens may draw mistaken inferences, and\nrestraints of deterrence and norm acceptance may be weakened for\nunjustified acts that resemble justified ones (Greenawalt 1987, 273).\nTherefore all such violations, justified and unjustified, should be\ntreated the same. \n\nBut much of this turns on the assumption that civilly disobedient\nbreaches of law are in fact comparable to ordinary offences and deserve\na comparable response from the law. The discussion in Section 1 of the\nkey features of civil disobedience showed that it differs greatly from\nordinary offences both in motivation and in mode of action, let alone\nmoral justification. This would suggest that civil disobedience should\nbe regarded in the eyes of the law as a different kind of disobedience\nfrom common crimes. This leaves two options: civil disobedience\ndeserves greater censure or it deserves less censure than ordinary\ncrimes do. \n\nThere are reasons to believe that civil disobedients should be dealt\nwith more severely than ordinary offenders are. First, there is the\nfact that disobedients seem to have put themselves above the law in\npreferring their own moral judgment about a certain issue to that of\nthe democratic decision-making process and the rule of law. (Although\nsome judges have endorsed this caricature, it is worth noting that it\nclashes with how both dissenters and many theorists characterise their\nactivities; cf. Rawls 1971; Greenawalt 1987; Markovits 2006.)\nSecond, the communicative aspect of civil disobedience could be said to\naggravate such offences since it usually is attended by much greater\npublicity than most covert violations are. This forces legal\nauthorities to concern themselves with the possibility that law-abiding\ncitizens will feel distressed, insecure and perhaps imposed on if no\naction is taken. So, notes Greenawalt, while authorities may quietly\nlet minor breaches pass, failure to respond to violations performed, in\nsome respect, in the presence of authority, may undercut claims that\nthe rules and the persons who administered them deserve respect\n(Greenawalt 1987, 351–2). Third, any use of violence would seem to\naggravate civil disobedience particularly when it increases the harm of\nthe offence or when it directly incites further and unjustified\ninstances of violence. And although violence may eloquently communicate\na dissenter's seriousness and frustration, it changes the nature\nof the dialogue. It pushes authorities to respond in ways consonant\nwith their stance on violence – responses which may be harsher\nthan those they would otherwise wish to make toward acts of civil\ndisobedience that defend values they can appreciate. \n\nThe final possible view is that civil disobedients should be dealt\nwith more leniently than ordinary offenders are, at least when their\ndisobedience is morally justified. These offenders are conscientiously\nmotivated and often their protests serve the interests of society by\nforcing a desirable re-examination of moral boundaries. That said,\nmoral justifications do not usually translate into legal justifications\nand disobedients have been notoriously unsuccessful at advancing a\ndefence of necessity (a defence that their action was legally justified\nbeing the lesser of two evils). Whether the law should be more\naccommodating of their conscientious motivation and efforts to engage\nin moral dialogue with government and society is a topic for further\ndebate. \n\nSome theorists maintain that civil disobedience is an outdated,\noveranalysed notion that little reflects current forms of political\nactivism, which tend toward more extreme modes of engagement. Herbert\nStoring has suggested that ‘The most striking characteristic of\ncivil disobedience is its irrelevance to the problems of today.’\n(Storing 1991, 85). He said, shortly after the assassination of\nMartin Luther King Jr, that the fashion of civil disobedience is as\nlikely to die out as it was to burst forth under the words of King.\nThere is of course much evidence to show that Storing was mistaken in\nhis predictions for the popularity of civil disobedience as a mode of\ndissent. Certainly though there have been shifts in the paradigm forms\nof civil disobedience in recent years; yet these shifts have occurred\nlargely within the framework of conscientious communication discussed\nat the outset. The historical paradigms of Gandhi, King, the\nsuffragettes, and Mandela are representative of that kind of civil\ndisobedience which aims to guarantee legal protection for the basic\nrights of a specific constituency. Such disobedience contrasts with\nmuch contemporary civil disobedience, which focuses not on\nindividuals' basic rights, but on broader issues or special\ninterests such as the environment, animal rights, nuclear disarmament,\nglobalisation, foreign policy, and so on. \n\nCivil disobedience taken in support of concerns such as the\nenvironment or animal rights may be seen in part as a response to some\nbreakdown in the mechanisms for citizen engagement in the\ndecision-making process. This breakdown might be termed a democratic\ndeficit (Markovits 2005). Such deficits in that dialogue may be an\ninevitable part of real democracies, and disobedience undertaken to\ncorrect those deficits may be said to reflect, to varying degrees,\ndissenters' sensitivity to democratic ideals. Civil disobedience\nremains today very much a vibrant part of liberal democracies and there\nare significant issues concerning civil disobedience for philosophers\nto address, particularly in how this practice may be distinguished from\nmore radical forms of protest and how this practice should be treated\nby the law.","contact.mail":"kimberley.brownlee@ubc.ca","contact.domain":"ubc.ca"}]
