Goldin","entry":"xunzi","body.text":"\n\n\nXunzi 荀子 (third century BCE) was a Confucian\nphilosopher, sometimes reckoned as the third of the three great\nclassical Confucians (after Confucius and Mencius). For most of\nimperial Chinese history, however, Xunzi was a bête\nnoire who was typically cited as an example of a Confucian who\nwent astray by rejecting Mencian convictions. Only in the last few\ndecades has Xunzi been widely recognized as one of China’s\ngreatest thinkers.\n\nThe name Xunzi means Master Xun and refers to Xun Kuang\n荀況, who was renowned in his day as “the most\nrevered of teachers” (zui wei laoshi\n最爲老師). His precise dates are unknown, and\nextant sources contradict one another: in particular, there is\ndisagreement as to whether he journeyed to the philosophical center of\nQi 齊 at the age of fifteen sui 歲 (i.e. thirteen\nor fourteen years of age) or fifty sui (forty-eight or\nforty-nine). The former figure is more plausible (Goldin 1999:\n110n.13; Knoblock 1982–83: 33–34), and would indicate a\nyear of birth sometime around 310 BCE All we can surmise of his death\nis that it must have been after 238 BCE, because he was alive when his\npatron, Lord Chunshen 春申君, was assassinated in\nthat year. Virtually all available information about his life comes\neither from internal references in Xunzi, the posthumously\nedited collection of his works, or from his biography in Records\nof the Historian 史記, by Sima Qian\n司馬遷 (145?–86? BCE), which is known to\ncontain serious distortions, especially in its treatment of famous\nphilosophers (Kern 2015). Hence modern attempts to piece together Xun\nKuang’s life (such as Knoblock 1988–94: I, 3–35; and\nLiao Mingchun 2005: 535–46) are necessarily tentative. \nSima Qian relates that Xunzi polished his voluminous writings in his\nold age, but they do not survive in his own recension. All extant\neditions of Xunzi derive from a compilation by Liu Xiang\n劉向 (79–8 BCE), a palace librarian who located 322\nbamboo bundles of text (pian 篇) that he confidently\nattributed to Xunzi, of which he eliminated 290 as duplicates. These\nhigh numbers suggest that Xunzi’s essays had been circulating\nindependently for about two centuries (Sato 2003: 27–36). The\ngeneral consensus today is that Xunzi is a collection of\npredominantly authentic essays, but certainly not organized in a\nmanner that Xun Kuang himself had authorized (e.g., Knoblock\n1988–94: I, 105–28). One indication of the diversity of\nLiu Xiang’s sources is that a few chapters (notably “A\nDebate about Warfare” [“Yibing” 議兵])\nrefer to Xunzi as Sun Qingzi 孫卿子, “Master\nChamberlain Sun”, a title that he himself would not have\n used.[1]\n The chapter divisions, in particular, seem unreliable: whereas some\nchapters read like self-standing essays, others do not. In\n“Refutation of Physiognomy” (“Feixiang”\n非相), for example, only the opening lines deal with\nphysiognomy; the rest of the chapter seems to consist of stray\npassages that Liu Xiang did not quite know where to insert. There are\nalso some chapters with generic instructional material, as well as\npoems and rhymed riddles that are rarely studied (Knechtges 1989). One\nof the consequences of this arrangement is that reconstructing\nXunzi’s arguments requires reading across chapter boundaries:\ntaken as a whole, the book conveys a distinctive philosophical\nposition, but individual chapters are inadequate, indeed sometimes\nincoherent, on their own (Kern 2016; Hutton 2014:\nxviii–xxiii). \nChapter\n 23,[2]\n “Human Nature is Evil” (Xing’e\n性惡), is a reasonable point of entry into Xunzi’s\nphilosophy for multiple reasons: it exemplifies some of the textual\nproblems mentioned above; it addresses one of the core themes of the\ncollection; and it was, for centuries, the most frequently cited\nsection of Xunzi. \nFirst, the two keywords need to be unpacked. Xing, commonly\ntranslated as “human nature”, is a term of uncertain\netymology that earlier philosophers had used in subtly dissimilar\nways. Mencius (372–289 BCE?), for example, used it to refer to\nthe ideal state than an organism is expected to attain under the right\nconditions, or perhaps an innate tendency toward that state (Graham\n1989: 117–32; Graham 1990: 7–66). Famously, Mencius argued\nthat the xing of human beings is good (shan\n善), by which he meant that all human beings have the\ncapacity to become good, even though, in reality, not all people\nare good, because they fail to exert themselves sufficiently—or\neven take the obligation seriously. \nIn Xunzi, “Human Nature is Evil” is framed as an\nargument with Mencius (who was probably long dead), and takes the view\nthat the xing of human beings is the very opposite of\nshan, namely e. The basic meaning of e is\nclose to “detestable” (as a transitive verb, wu\n惡 means “to hate”); the translation\n“evil” is acceptable only with the understanding that\nsomething like an Augustinian conception of evil is not intended.\n(Some scholars opt for “bad”, another standard antonym of\n“good” in English.) But in prosecuting this position,\nXunzi uses xing in a fundamentally different sense:\n“What is so by birth is called xing”\n(Xunzi\n 22.1b).[3]\n Thus xing refers to the basic faculties, capacities, and\ndesires that we have from birth, which cannot be called\n“good” because following the impulses of our\nxing, without reflecting on them and moderating them, will\nlead us to act harmfully (Hutton 2000; Tang 2016: 51). \nIn effect, both Xunzi and Mencius argued that human beings all have\nthe capacity to become good, even though some people develop this\ncapacity and others do not (Graham 1989: 250; Shun 1997:\n222–31). The main differences, only recently appreciated, are\nthat they were not operating with the same implicit definitions of\nxing, and Xunzi’s recommendations for moral\nself-cultivation—that is, how to overcome one’s inherently\ndetestable nature—were more complex than Mencius’s, as we\nshall see. Because of Mencius’s subsequent prestige, it was\ncommonly supposed that Xunzi’s definition of xing was\nheterodox, if not deliberately subversive. But a collection of\nConfucian manuscripts recently excavated from a tomb near the modern\ntown of Guodian 郭店 and dated to ca. 300 BCE suggests\nthat it may have been Mencius’s usage of xing,\nnot Xunzi’s, which was considered eccentric in ancient\n times.[4]\n The Guodian text called The Xing\nEmerges from the Endowment (Xing zi ming chu\n性自命出) defines xing in a manner\nvery similar to Xunzi: the set of inborn characteristics shared by all\nmembers of a species (Goldin 2005: 38). \nFixating on the title “Human Nature Is Evil” (which may or\nmay not derive from Xunzi himself) can lead to an elision of the\nsecond half of the chapter’s credo: “what is good [in\npeople] is their artifice” (qi shan zhe wei ye\n其善者偽也). “Artifice”\n (wei)[5]\n refers to all the traits and habits that we acquire through our own\nconscious actions. And if we achieve any goodness, it must be because\nof our artifice: whereas  \nobeying one’s xing and following one’s emotions\nmust result in contention and robbery … the transformation\n[brought about by] the methods of a teacher and the Way of ritual and\nmorality will result in deference and courtesy, in accordance with\nrefinement and principles, and return to order. (Xunzi 23.1a)\n \nThus the phrase that is used to denote moral self-cultivation is not\nto overcome or abandon the xing, but to transform it\n(huaxing 化性). For this reason, in addition to\nstylistic features that trouble some readers, the chapter is\noccasionally impugned as corrupt or inauthentic (Robins 2001–02;\nZhou Chicheng 2014). \nWhat prompted Xunzi to dissent from Mencius’s characterization\nof xing as good if he ultimately agreed with Mencius’s\nlarger view: that people can perfect themselves and that such an\nachievement requires great exertion and self-motivation? Perhaps Xunzi\nwished to highlight his conviction that the proper models for moral\nbehavior lie outside the self, which is fundamentally opposed to a\nMencian notion of Four Beginnings (siduan 四端)\nlodged within the human heart (e.g., Mencius 2A.6). Whereas\nMencians have always emphasized looking inwards for moral\ndirection—sometimes complicated by the acknowledgment that the\nheart can be corrupted—self-cultivation in the Xunzian style is\ninconceivable without looking outwards. \nXunzi held that for most ordinary people, the best guide is the set of\nrituals (li) handed down by sages of yore (sheng\n聖 or shengren 聖人). What are rituals and\nwhy did the sages institute them? In some passages, Xunzi attributes,\nin a manner superficially reminiscent of Hobbes or Rousseau, the\ngenesis of the rituals to the sages’ recognition that unbridled\ncompetition produces a globally unsustainable situation:  \nIf people follow their desires, then boundaries cannot contain them\nand objects cannot satisfy them. Thus the Former Kings restrained them\nand established for them ritual and morality in order to divide them\n[into classes]. (Xunzi 4.12; cf. 19.1a)  \nSometimes these rituals are described as efficient social conventions\n(e.g., Perkins 2014: 189–97), but this is inadequate for two\nreasons. \nFirst, Xunzi elsewhere explicitly denies that an arbitrarily chosen\nset of rituals would be effective. Rather, the rituals of the sage\nkings are legitimate because they accord with “that which makes\nhumans human” (ren zhi suoyi wei ren zhe\n人之所以為人者); by\nimplication, any competing ritual code would necessarily fail.\nSpecifically, human beings, unlike any other species of animal, abide\nby certain distinctions (bian 辨)—male is\ndistinguished from female, old from young, and so on—and it is\naltogether natural that we do so. The rituals of the sage kings\nconfirm the distinctions that we are bound to make by nature (the core\ntext is Xunzi 5.4; see also 10.3a and 19.1c). \nSecond, rituals, in Xunzi’s conception, not only facilitate\nsocial cohesion, but also foster moral and psychological development\n(Ivanhoe 2014; Yearley 2014: 92–101). Indeed, if they did not,\nthey would be mere instruments of expedience, not rituals. These\ndimensions become clear when Xunzi begins to discuss specific rituals\nand their purposes. We observe regulations concerning funerary\nceremonies and grave goods, for example, in order to learn how to\navoid incivility and miserliness (19.4a-b). Similarly, the mandatory\nthree-year mourning period for deceased rulers and parents helps us\nconduct ourselves properly by providing suitable forms for us to\nexpress emotions that are so deep as to be potentially debilitating:\n \nWhen a wound is colossal, its duration is long; when pain is profound,\nthe recovery is slow. The three-year mourning period is a form\nestablished with reference to emotions; it is the means by which one\nconveys the acme of one’s pain. (Xunzi 19.9a) \nOne ritual discussed in extenso is the village wine-drinking\nceremony (xiang 鄉). The fact that the host fetches the\nguest of honor himself, but expects the other guests to arrive on\ntheir own, underscores the distinctions that need to be drawn between\nnoble and base. And the detail that each participant toasts the next,\nserially and according to their ages, demonstrates that one can align\nsociety according to seniority without excluding anyone. When the\nguest of honor retires, the host bows and escorts him out, and the\nformal occasion comes to an end: this is to make it known that one can\nfeast at leisure without becoming disorderly. The clear implication is\nthat by taking part in the rite, we can gradually comprehend the moral\nprinciples that the sages wished us to embody (Xunzi\n20.5). \nXunzi’s rituals have such an important role to play in our\nemotional and moral development that he spends an entire chapter\nlimning what are essentially rituals of artistic expression. The term\nhe uses is “music” (yue), which is distinct from\nritual, but Xunzi’s conception of their origin and purpose is so\nsimilar that we can scarcely speak of one without the other. Thus\n“ritual and music” (liyue) can only be understood\nas two aspects of human artifice (wei): “ritual”\nrefers to cultural forms that affect social cohesion,\n“music” to those involving the orderly expression of human\nemotions. The crucial point is that the sages created both. \nLike all Confucians, Xunzi accepts that human beings have certain\nirrepressible impulses (Xunzi 20.1), which are not\nobjectionable in themselves. The problem is that unreflective\noutbursts driven solely by emotional responses may cause harm, and\nthus we are enjoined to be mindful of our impulses, rather than to\nextinguish them (compare Xunzi 22.5a). To aid us in this\nprocess, the Sages left behind appropriate musical compositions that\nwe can use to channel our need to express ourselves. What Xunzi meant\nby this is the canonical collection of Odes (Shi\n詩), which all Confucians seem to have regarded as a nonpareil\nrepository of edifying literature (Goldin 2005: 35). \nXunzi’s immediate purpose in this section was to counter the\nMohist view that music is wasteful. Xunzi counters that by focusing\nexclusively on the material costs, Mo Di 墨翟 (d. ca. 390\nBCE) and his followers failed to recognize the psychological utility\nof music as an instrument of moral suasion (Cook 1997: 21–24;\nGraham 1989: 259–61).  \nWhen music is centered and balanced, the people are harmonious and not\ndissipated. When music is stern and grave, the people are uniform and\nnot disorderly. When the people are harmonious and uniform, the army\nis firm and the citadels secure; enemy states dare not invade.\n(Xunzi 20.2) \nAs the last quote intimates, the proper implementation of ritual is\nalso decisive in politics and international\n relations.[6]\n In the “Debate about Warfare”, for example, Xunzi offers\na distinctive variant of the old Confucian idea that a true king\n(wang 王—always a moral term in Confucian\ndiscourse) will succeed on the battlefield without even having to\nfight, because the populace will not support a tyrant or hegemon\n(ba 霸, a lord who rules by brute force). What is\nunique is Xunzi’s emphasis on ritual as the key to a\nwell-ordered state. To be sure, earlier writings had also discussed\nthe idea of ritual as the foundation of statecraft, and the Zuo\nCommentary to the Springs and Autumns (Zuozhuan\n左傳), in particular, is famous for its scenes in which a\nruler who is about to attack his neighbor publicly justifies his\naggression on the grounds that he is merely “punishing”\nhis enemy’s intolerable violations of ritual. But Xunzi raises\nthe significance of ritual to a new level: in his view, the\nruler’s ability to govern his state in accordance with ritual is\nthe sole criterion that will determine success or failure on the\nbattlefield (Xunzi 15.1c; see also Xunzi 16.1). \nHaving established that “exalting ritual” (longli\n隆禮) is the true path to order and strength, Xunzi\nexpatiates in characteristic language:  \nWhen kings and dukes follow [the rituals], that is how they obtain the\nworld; when they do not follow them, that is how they bring about the\nperdition of their altars of soil and grain. (Xunzi 15.4)\n \nEven advanced military technology is no match for a king who\n“exalts ritual and esteems morality”. \nAccordingly, in two passages assessing the mighty state of Qin\n秦—which would go on to unify the Chinese world under the\ninfamous First Emperor (r. 221–210 BCE)—Xunzi acknowledged\nits power but diagnosed a correctible weakness: it lacked schooled\nmoral advisors (like himself) to guide the ruler and save him from\nself-defeating avarice and aggression. Such counselors, moreover,\nshould have a Confucian orientation (Xunzi 8.2–10 and\n16.4–6). The judgment of most ancient writers is that Qin never\ncorrected this weakness. \nXunzi places so much emphasis on the role of the rituals in moral\nself-cultivation that one might ask how the sages managed to perfect\nthemselves when they did not have such a model themselves. A glimpse\nof the answer was already afforded by Xunzi’s insistence that\nthe rituals surpass any arbitrary code of conduct because they accord\nwith fundamental human tendencies. But elsewhere the question is\naddressed more fully. The rituals, it turns out, are the equivalent of\nhelpful signposts. Just as those who ford rivers “mark”\n(biao 表) treacherous spots, the sages “marked\nthe Way” (biao dao 表道) by means of\nrituals, so that people would no longer stumble (Xunzi\n17.11). \nThe Way that Xunzi invokes in this simile is sometimes called\n“constancy” (chang 常). Heaven’s\nprocesses (tianxing 天行) do not change from one\nepoch to the\n next;[7]\n thus one must learn how to respond to them with “the right\norder” (zhi 治), whereafter it would be either\nignorant or hypocritical to blame Heaven for one’s misfortune.\nWhen a ruler governs a state well, there are bound to be good results;\nwhen a ruler governs a state badly, there are bound to be bad results.\nDisasters can have no long-term consequences because a well governed\nstate will prosper even in the face of disasters, and a poorly\ngoverned state will be vanquished even if it avoids disasters\naltogether. (Xunzi’s opinion of foreseeable natural disasters\nsuch as hurricanes would undoubtedly have been that they strike\nall states, but a well governed state will be prepared for\nsuch an event, whereas a poorly governed state will be in no position\nto respond to the crisis.) Consequently, Heaven plays a sure but\nindirect role in determining our fortune or misfortune. Heaven never\nintercedes directly in human affairs, but human affairs are certain to\nsucceed or fail according to a timeless pattern that Heaven determined\nbefore human beings existed. “The revolutions of the sun, moon,\nand stars, and the cyclical calendar—these were the same under\nYu 禹 and Jie 桀” (Xunzi 17.4), he notes,\nreferring to a paradigmatic sage king and tyrant, respectively. The\nsame is true of the regular and predictable sequence of the\nseasons—a particularly significant example, as we shall see. \nNext, Xunzi makes a crucial distinction between knowing Heaven\n(zhi tian 知天) and knowing the Way (zhi\ndao 知道). The former is impossible, and therefore a\nwaste of time to attempt, but the latter is open to all who try. To\ncite a modern parallel, it is not difficult to understand how\nthe force of gravity works by carefully observing its effects in the\nphenomenal world, but to understand why gravity works is a\ndifferent matter altogether. Xunzi would say that one should constrain\none’s inquiries to learning how gravity works, and then think\nabout how to apply this irresistible force of nature to improve the\nlives of humankind (Fraser 2016: 297–300). His attitude was not\nscientific in our sense. Speaking of “those who are enlightened\nabout the distinction between Heaven and human beings”, he\nsays: \nThus rituals are not merely received practices or convenient social\ninstitutions; they are practicable forms in which the sages aimed to\nencapsulate the fundamental patterns of the universe. No human being,\nnot even a sage, can know Heaven, but we can know Heaven’s Way,\nwhich is the surest path to a flourishing and blessed life. Because\nhuman beings have limited knowledge and abilities, it is difficult for\nus to attain this deep understanding, and therefore the sages handed\ndown the rituals to help us follow in their footsteps. \nAlthough this discussion has presented the Way as an unchanging\ncosmological reality to which we must conform (or suffer the\nconsequences), it is sometimes understood, rather, as having been\nconstructed by human beings. A.C. Graham first raised this issue by\nasking, “Is Xunzi saying that man imposes his own meaning on an\notherwise meaningless universe?” (Graham 1989: 243). Although\nGraham himself answered his question in the negative, others have\nsince pressed the point further. This is probably the greatest\ncontroversy in Xunzi studies today. \nOne passage, in particular, is frequently cited as support for a\nconstructivist position (Hagen 2007: 11.n31; Tang 2016: 59, 75, 118):\n“The Way is not the Way of Heaven, nor the Way of Earth; it is\nwhat people regard as the Way, what the noble man is guided by”\n(Xunzi 8.3). This seems to say, despite what we have seen\nabout apprehending the constancy of Heaven and then applying it\nprofitably to daily life, that we are supposed to disregard the Way of\nHeaven, and create our own Way instead. The basic problem is that the\nsurviving text of Xunzi is vague enough to permit various\ninterpretations, but the repeated references to the importance of\nobserving and appropriately “responding” (ying\n應) to the seasons would seem to rule out the interpretation\nthat natural patterns are not to be taken as normative. \nYang Liang 楊倞 (fl. 818 CE), the author of the oldest\nextant commentary on Xunzi, evidently recognized this\nproblem, and tried to soften the impact of Xunzi 8.3 by\nmaking it fit with the rest of the text:  \nThis emphasizes that the Way of the Former Kings was not a matter of\nyin and yang, or mountains and rivers, or omens and\nprodigies, but the Way that people practice.  \nYang Liang’s opinion is surely not decisive: he was but an\ninterpreter, not the master himself, and his glosses are not always\nregarded as the most compelling today. But in this case he may have\nbeen right that Xunzi meant to say no more than that the Way is to be\nfound not in prodigies and other freakish occurrences, but in the\n“constancies” that people can put into practice. Indeed,\nthe very notion that the Way of Heaven, the Way of Earth, and the Way\nof human beings are distinct entities would contradict the frequently\nreiterated point that there is only one Way, e.g., “There are no\ntwo Ways in the world, and the Sage is never of two minds”\n(Xunzi 21.1). This single and holistic Way, moreover, serves\nas the enduring standard for all times because all ramified truths of\nthe universe are unified within it (Xunzi 5.5, 21.6b, and\n22.6b). \nWhat we need to understand, then, is the Way as it pertains to\nhuman beings. Unusual celestial phenomena such as shooting stars\nmust, theoretically, be explainable by a comprehensive formulation of\nthe Way—there can be no violations of the Way in the\nnatural world—but this is exactly why we do not aim for a\ncomprehensive formulation of the Way (cf. Hutton 2016a: 81–83).\nWe can safely ignore shooting stars as irrelevant to human beings\nbecause they do not provide replicable patterns for use in moral and\nsocial development. Responding to the seasons with timely planting and\nharvesting is, once again, a more productive model. \nIn accordance with his notion of the Way as the observable\n“constancies” that can be profitably applied to human\nconduct, Xunzi argued strongly against the notion that weird\noccurrences on earth can be rationalized as monitory signs from\nHeaven. Superficially terrifying occurrences such as shooting stars or\nsqualling trees are merely “shifts in Heaven and Earth,\ntransformations of yin and yang, material\nanomalies” (Xunzi 17.7). We should be concerned instead\nwith “human portents” (renyao 人祅),\na term that would have seemed as counterintuitive in Xunzi’s\nlanguage as it does in ours. “Human portents” are the many\nshortsighted and immoral acts through which human beings bring on\ntheir own destruction: “poor plowing that harms the harvest,\nhoeing and weeding out of season, governmental malice that causes the\nloss of the people” (Xunzi 17.7). Heaven has no part in\nsuch wrongdoing. Now and then strange things may happen in the skies,\nbut they have happened at all moments in history, and they have never\nbeen sufficient to destroy a prudent and moral society—whereas\nan imprudent and immoral society will fail even if it is spared an\neclipse. \nXunzi even extends this theory of “human portents” to\ncontend that religious ceremonies have no numinous effect; we carry\nthem out merely for their inherent beauty and the social cohesion that\nthey\n promote.[8] \nIf the sacrifice for rain [is performed], and it rains, what of it? I\nsay: It is nothing. Even if there had been no sacrifice, it would have\nrained. … Thus the noble man takes [these ceremonies] to be\nembellishment, but the populace takes them to be spiritual. To take\nthem as embellishment is auspicious; to take them as spiritual is\ninauspicious. (Xunzi 17.8) \nXunzi’s famous essay on language, “Rectifying Names”\n(“Zhengming” 正名) includes some impressive\ninsights into the nature of verbal communication (William S-Y. Wang\n1989: 186–89), but the primary concern of the chapter is\nmorality, not linguistics (Fraser 2016: 293–96). The thrust of\nthe essay is easily missed because a few of Xunzi’s comments\nsound as though they came out of a modern pragmatics textbook, e.g.,\n“Names have no inherent appropriateness. We designate them [by\nsome word] in order to name them” (Xunzi 22.2g).\nAlthough this may sound like something that Ferdinand de Saussure\n(1857–1913) could have written, Xunzi was not interested in the\nsame questions as modern linguists. In “Rectifying Names”,\nXunzi also discusses sophistic paradoxes that were rampant in his day\n(the most famous being “A white horse is not a\n horse”),[9]\n dividing them into three typological categories. His conclusion\ndiscloses that his main purpose is not a proper taxonomy of falsidical\nparadoxes (for this term, see Quine 1976: 3), but an assertion of the\nmoral purpose of language:  \nAll heretical theories and aberrant sayings depart from the correct\nWay and are presumptuously crafted according to these three categories\nof delusion. (Xunzi 22.3d)  \nThe paradoxes of the sophists cannot be used as a basis for moral\ngovernance, and thus would be objectionable even if they were not in\nfact false; they are “disputes with no use”\n(Xunzi 6.6). \nThe only legitimate purpose of language, like that of government\nitself, is to serve as the king’s tool in propagating moral\nexcellence:  \nWhen one who is a king determines names, if names are fixed and\nrealities distinguished, if the Way is practiced and his intentions\ncommunicated, then he may cautiously lead the people and unify them by\nthis means. (Xunzi 22.1c)  \nThe task of determining names and then enforcing their use belongs to\nthe king alone, not to any lord and certainly not to the people.\n“One who is a king” (wangzhe 王者)\nrefers not to the person who happens to be sitting on the throne, but\nsomeone who has lived up to the moral requirements of that office and\nduly rules the world by his charismatic example. Accordingly, a phrase\nlike “leading and unifying the people” refers not to\nexpedient rulership, but to implementing the Confucian project of\nmorally transforming the world. Language is useful in that enterprise\nbecause, without it, the people could not even understand the\nruler’s wishes, let alone carry them out. \nJust as the rituals need to be based on the foundation of the Way, the\nruler’s names, though they can be arbitrary as designations,\nmust correspond to reality. You can make up the word for\n“reality”, but you cannot make up reality. “Same and\ndifferent” (tongyi 同異) are distinguished\nby the so-called “Heaven-endowed bureaux”\n(tianguan 天官), i.e. the eyes, ears, mouth,\nnose, body, and heart-mind. For most of these, we might say\n“senses” or “sense organs” in English, but the\nheart-mind (xin 心) is an exceptional case, for it is\nsaid to be able to distinguish “statements, reasons, happiness,\nresentment, grief, joy, love, hate, and desire” (Xunzi\n22.d), which are not simply sense data. The heart-mind will be treated\nmore fully in the next section. \nThe suggestion that we rely upon our senses to perceive the world\naround us represents a substantial claim on Xunzi’s part,\nbecause other philosophers had already suggested that reality is not\nstraightforwardly discerned; on the contrary, one’s partial\nperspective on reality necessarily informs one’s perception of\nit. This was, essentially, the argument in “Discourse on the\nEquality of Things” (“Qiwu lun”\n齊物論), an important chapter in Zhuangzi\n莊子 (e.g., Graham 1989: 176–83). For Xunzi,\nhowever, reality is reality, regardless of how we perceive it. Once\nagain, some scholars (e.g., Hagen 2007: 59–84) question whether\nXunzi is such a strong realist, but a constructivist interpretation is\ndifficult to reconcile with Xunzi’s repeated assertions that\nlanguage must conform to reality and the Way, e.g., “Names are\nthat by which one defines different real objects”\n(Xunzi 22.3f). \nIn many respects, the heart-mind is the keystone of Xunzi’s\nphilosophy, the one piece that links together all the others. The\nChinese word xin means “heart”, but Xunzi\nattributes such strong and varied mental processes to this organ that\none has to construe it as not only the heart but also the mind. (The\nmind was not located in the brain in premodern Chinese\nphilosophy.) \nFirst, the heart-mind is the organ that we use to discover the Way.\nXunzi’s discussion of Heaven presents his argument that moral\nself-cultivation is a matter of correctly perceiving and then applying\nthe Way, but does not explain how we perceive the Way in the first\nplace. Elsewhere, he states explicitly that we come “to know the\nWay” by means of our heart-mind (Xunzi 21.5d), which\nhas three cardinal attributes: “emptiness” (xu\n虛) “unity” (yi 壹), and\n“tranquility” (jing 靜). Xunzi patently\nborrowed these three terms from earlier discourse, particularly\nZhuangzi (e.g., Yearley 1980; Goldin 1999: 22–31;\nStalnaker 2003), and uses them to denote three nurturable faculties\nthat we all possess from birth, but do not employ to the same degree.\n(The title of the relevant chapter, “Resolving Blindness”,\nrefers to the self-destructive acts that people undertake because they\nfail to employ their heart-minds correctly.) “Emptiness”\nrefers to the heart-mind’s ability to store a seemingly\nunlimited amount of information: we do not have to erase one datum in\norder to make room for another. “Unity” refers to the\nheart-mind’s ability to synthesize diverse data into meaningful\nparadigms. And “tranquility” refers to the\nheart-mind’s ability to distinguish fantasy from rational\nthinking. Armed with these powers, we can infer the patterns of the\nWay by taking in, and then pondering, the data transmitted to the\nheart-mind by the senses. \nIn addition, the heart-mind is the chief among the organs. It is the\nonly organ that can command the others; indeed, it is the only organ\nwith any self-consciousness. “The mind is the lord of the body\n… It issues commands but does not receive commands”\n(Xunzi 21.6a). Because the heart-mind can control both itself\nand all other organs of the body, it is the font of\n“artifice”, or the deliberate actions that begin to\ntransform the morally deficient xing: “When the\nheart-mind reasons and the other faculties put it into\naction—this is called ‘artifice’”\n(Xunzi 22.1b). The heart-mind is capable of overriding every\nhuman impulse, even the instinct of self-preservation, if it conflicts\nwith the correct “patterns” (li\n 理).[10]\n We have the necessary faculties to recognize immorality when we see\nit, and if we permit ourselves to tread an immoral path, we cannot\nblame our emotions or desires, but must accept that our heart-mind has\nfailed to exert the requisite discipline. We know that we could have\ndone better. Indeed, when we speak of “we”, we are\nspeaking of our heart-mind. For the heart-mind is the crucible where\nthese teeming moral deliberations take place. \nThus Xunzi ends, like all Confucians, with individual responsibility:\nin his case, the heart-mind’s obligation to process the\nprinciples of the Way and then command the rest of the body to\nconform. Because we are not sages, we are advised to follow the\nrituals in order to attain this degree of understanding, but,\nfundamentally, the path to morality is open to anyone who sees and\nthinks (Xunzi 8.11 and 23.5b). \nXunzi’s conception of the heart-mind also figures in a\ndistinctive congruence that he postulates between a kingdom and a\nhuman being. A kingdom possesses an initial set of features—it\nmay be large or small, rich or poor, hilly or flat—but these are\nimmaterial to its ultimate success or failure, for any territory,\nhowever small, provides enough of a base for a sage to conquer the\nworld. Thus it is the management of the state, and not its natural\nresources, that determine whether it will become the demesne of a king\nor be conquered by its neighbors. This management, furthermore,\ncomprises two elements: a proper method, namely the rituals of the\nsage kings; and a decisive agent, namely the lord, who chooses either\nto adopt the rituals or unwisely discard them. \nIn much the same way, human beings are made up of two parts: their\nxing, or detestable initial condition, and wei,\ntheir conscious conduct. They may reform themselves or they may remain\ndetestable: this depends entirely on their conduct. The management of\nthe self, just like the management of the state, comprises two\nelements: a proper method, which is, once again, the rituals of the\nsage kings; and a decisive agent, which chooses either to adopt the\nrituals or unwisely discard them. This agent, the analogue of the lord\nof a state, is the heart-mind (Goldin 1999:\n 16–17).[11]\n As in the Broadway song, “It’s not where you start;\nit’s where you finish” (Fields et al. 1973 [1975:\n54]). \n At[12]\n the end of his life, Xunzi was the leading teacher and philosopher in\nthe Chinese world. Among his former students were some of the most\ninfluential men in politics, including Han Fei 韓非 (d.\n233 BCE), Li Si 李斯 (d. 208 BCE), and Zhang Cang\n張蒼 (ca. 250–151 BCE), as well as transmitters of\nseveral leading redactions of canonical texts, including Fuqiu Bo\n浮丘伯 and perhaps Mao Heng 毛亨 (Goldin\n1999: xii). \nThe early Han 漢 dynasty statesman Lu Jia 陸賈 (ca.\n228–ca. 140 BCE) is sometimes said to have been Xunzi’s\nstudent as well (e.g., by Tang Yan 唐晏 [1857–1920]\nin Wang Liqi 1986: 222–23), but the two men’s dates make\nthis relationship unlikely. Perhaps Lu Jia was a disciple of Fuqiu Bo,\nand thus an intellectual grandson of Xunzi. Regardless, the strongest\nevidence of Lu Jia’s indebtedness to Xunzi lies on the level of\nideas (Li Dingfang 1980). Like Xunzi, Lu Jia appealed to the classics,\nthe sages’ textual legacy, as the best practical guide to\ngovernment and moral self-cultivation (Puett 2002: 253–54; Jin\nChunfeng 2006: 73–74). But Lu’s most important\nphilosophical thesis is that human beings bring about auspicious and\ninauspicious omens through their own actions. \nXunzi, we recall, argued strongly against the belief in Heavenly\nportents. Lu Jia accepted Xunzi’s framework, but with a single,\nconsequential innovation: people bring about their own fortune or\nmisfortune by emitting qi 氣:  \nThus when societies fail and the Way is lost, it is not the work of\nHeaven. The lord of the state has done something to cause it. Bad\ngovernment breeds bad qi; bad qi breeds disasters\nand abnormalities. (Wang Liqi 1986: 155)  \nBy adding the element of qi—a term that Xunzi rarely\nused, and certainly did not build into his metaphysics—Lu Jia\nretains Xunzi’s volitionless and mechanistic Heaven but forges a\nnovel philosophical justification for the arcane science of omenology,\nwhich Xunzi mercilessly deprecated. Where Xunzi counseled us to ignore\nabnormalities, Lu Jia accepts their validity as\n“admonitions” (jie 誡). But, once again,\nHeaven itself has no effect on our success or failure. If we are faced\nwith a host of wood-boring caterpillars, to use Lu’s vivid\nexample, the only way to account for them is to acknowledge that our\ngovernment is responsible for their generation through its maleficent\nconduct (Zhou Guidian 1999: 51–53; Puett 2002: 249–52).\nTwo coeval philosophers, Jia Yi 賈誼 (201–169 BCE)\nand Dong Zhongshu 董仲舒 (ca. 198–ca. 107\nBCE), agreed that human beings are responsible for their own fortune\nor misfortune, and thus have no cause to blame Heaven, although Jia Yi\ndid not refer to qi in prosecuting his theory, whereas Dong\nZhongshu did (Goldin 2007). \nDong Zhongshu is reported to have written a paean to Xunzi (now lost),\nand writers of late antiquity, such as Wang Chong 王充\n(27–ca. 100 CE) and Ban Gu 班固 (32–92 CE),\nstill took him seriously as a philosopher. But thereafter,\nXunzi’s star began to set. In later centuries, the two\ntirelessly repeated clichés about Xunzi were that he propagated\nthe anti-Mencian doctrine that human nature is evil, and that, by\nserving as Li Si’s and Han Fei’s teacher, he furthered the\ncause of Legalism (fajia 法家) and thus subverted\nhigh-minded principles. Ji Kang 嵇康 (223–262), for\nexample, obliquely identified Xunzi as the chief architect of\neverything that Ji and his group disdained: artificial ritualism,\ncounterfeit erudition, and an oppressive network of laws that serve\nonly to interfere with the innocuous enjoyment of life (Goldin 2007:\n140–42). \nBy the Tang 唐 dynasty, even literati who admired\nXunzi—such as Han Yu 韓愈 (768–824)—were\ncareful to add that his works contain grave mistakes (Kong Fan 1997:\n281; Liu Youming 2006: 48–50). In the Song 宋, there were\nstill some voices that praised him, but the opinion with the greatest\nlong-term consequences was that of Zhu Xi 朱熹\n(1130–1200), who declared that Xunzi’s philosophy\nresembled those of non-Confucians such as Shen Buhai\n申不害 (fl. 354–340 BCE) and Shang Yang\n商鞅 (d. 338 BCE), and that he was indirectly responsible\nfor the notorious disasters of the Qin dynasty (Kong Fan 1997:\n291–95). For the rest of imperial history, Xunzi was rejected by\nthe cultural\n mainstream;[13]\n into the twentieth century, he was criticized by intellectuals such\nas Kang Youwei 康有爲 (1858–1927), Tan Sitong\n譚嗣同 (1865–1898), and Liang Qichao\n梁啟超 (1873–1929) as the progenitor of the\nConfucian scriptural legacy, which, in their view, had derailed the\noriginal Confucian mission and plunged China into a cycle of\nauthoritarianism and corruption that lasted more than two thousand\nyears. \nToday the tide has reversed almost completely. Xunzi is one of the\nmost popular philosophers throughout East Asia, and has been the\nsubject of a large number of books published over the past two\ndecades. From a twenty-first-century perspective, this revival of\ninterest in Xunzi is not hard to explain: his body of work has always\nbeen one of the best preserved, and with the commonplace scholastic\nobjections to his philosophy having lost most of their cogency, it is\nonly to be expected that philosophical readers should be attracted to\nhis creative but rigorous arguments. In this sense one could say that\nXunzi has finally been restored, more than two millennia after his\ndeath, to his erstwhile position as zui wei lao shi.","contact.mail":"prg@sas.upenn.edu","contact.domain":"sas.upenn.edu"}]
