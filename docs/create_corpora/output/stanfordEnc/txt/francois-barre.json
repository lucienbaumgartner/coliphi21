Together the three books\nconstitute one of the most detailed analyses of the subjugation of\nwomen written in the seventeenth century.\n\n\nPoulain’s thought was deeply influenced by René\nDescartes’ philosophy. He used Descartes’ methods of doubt\nand right reasoning in order to reject prejudices about the\ninferiority of women and his arguments in defense of the equality of\nthe sexes use many insights drawn from Descartes’ account of\nthe nature of the human being. After an introductory biographical\nsketch, this entry will first examine the Cartesian foundations of\nPoulain’s thought and then proceed to a discussion of his\nanalysis of the subjugation of women. Next, his four main arguments\nfor the equality of the sexes are presented and evaluated. The entry\ncloses with a brief discussion of Poulain’s direct and indirect\nrelations to later developments in the history of feminist thought.\nThroughout, the aim is to present Poulain’s core ideas as well\nas examine their philosophical validity.\n\nWe know relatively little about the life of François Poulain\n(or Poullain) de la Barre. No correspondence or accounts by his\ncontemporaries have survived. What we know has to be reconstructed\nfrom occasional surviving official documents and from supposedly\nautobiographical remarks in his writings. Accounts of Poulain’s\nlife rely on archival research done in particular by Marie-Louise\nStock (1961), Madeleine Alcover (1981), and Siep Stuurman (2004). \nPoulain was born in Paris in 1648, as the third child to wealthy\nCatholic parents. As many younger sons he was destined for a church\ncareer and he earned his bachelor’s degree in theology at\nSorbonne in 1666. This lower degree was generally considered\nsufficient for priesthood, but Poulain did not at this point of his\nlife seek to be ordained and this decision, though temporary, is often\nconnected with his growing interest in Cartesian philosophy (Stuurman\n2004: 30). In his second main work De l’éducation des\ndames [On the Education of Ladies] (1674), a set of five\nconversations between a Cartesian teacher, a young man and two young\nwomen, Poulain describes how the teacher Stasimachus became a follower\nof René Descartes’ philosophy. Stasimachus tells his\nyoung interlocutors how, one day, when he found  \nall the sciences of the Schools particularly distasteful, by a great\nstroke of luck I allowed myself to be taken off by a friend to hear a\nCartesian lecturing on a subject concerning the human body. (TTen 245;\nTTfr 281)  \nFed on Scholastic prejudices against Cartesian philosophy, Stasimachus\nwas initially suspicious and then  \nastonished to hear nothing but what was clear and intelligible, to\nrealize that [the speaker] was reasoning on the basis of principles\nthat were so simple and so true that I could not fail to agree with\nthem. (TTen 245; TTfr 281–282)  \nAs Stuurman points out, this description is a “streamlined\nconversion story”, of a type often repeated by followers of\nDescartes’ philosophy during the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury (Stuurman 2004: 35). Stasimachus’ conversion must not be\nread as Poulain’s autobiography, but we have strong grounds to\nassume that Poulain became interested in Cartesian philosophy while\nstill a student and that his interest was connected to attending\npublic lectures, such as those held in Paris by the Cartesian Jacques\nRohault (Stuurman 2004: 43). \nScholars also agree that after leaving university, Poulain was\nteaching literature and a textbook on translating Latin into French,\npublished anonymously in 1672, has been attributed to him (Stock 1961:\n19–20; Welch 2002a: 9). In the following year he published\nDe l’égalité des deux sexes [On the\nEquality of the Two Sexes] (1673), the first and most widely known of\nhis three feminist treatises. One year later it was followed by De\nl’éducation des dames and in the next year by De\nl’excellence des hommes, contre l’égalité\ndes sexes [On the Excellence of Men, against the Equality of the\nSexes] (1675). Despite its name the third treatise continues\nPoulain’s defense of equality between the sexes by overturning\nhis rhetorically presented arguments on the behalf of the excellence\nof men. This treatise is less Cartesian than the two earlier ones and\nmore engaged with theological arguments. In this respect it resembles\nearlier treatises participating in the Renaissance querelle des\nfemmes, the debate about the superiority of women versus men,\nsuch as Cornelius Agrippa’s De nobilitate et praecellentia\nfoeminei sexus [On the Nobility and Preeminence of the Female\nSex] (1509/1529). \nAt some point after publishing his three feminist treatises, Poulain\nreturned to theology and he was ordained a Catholic priest in 1679.\nHis decision to take up a church career after having written treatises\nheavily critical of Scholastic philosophy might seem odd. There is no\ndoubt that Poulain used Cartesian arguments as a basis for his\nfeminist claims and that he was critical of Scholasticism, but we must\nalso note that his third treatise is in many respect a reconciliation\nbetween his feminism and theology. When reconstructing Poulain’s\nopinions we must be careful not to identify him too closely with the\ncharacter Stasimachus. As Carol Pal has argued in the case of the\nfriendship between Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia, with strong\nCartesian sympathies, and Anna Maria van Schurman, who was in many\nrespects a Scholastic thinker, it was not unusual that\nseventeenth-century intellectuals combined elements from the old and\nthe new philosophy (Pal 2012: 250–254). It is quite possible\nthat Poulain was less militant a convert to Cartesianism than his\ncharacter Stasimachus. \nAfter being ordained Poulain served as a curate in two parishes in\nPicardy, first in the medium-sized village La Flamengrie, from where\nhe was transferred to the small village Versigny in 1685, possibly as\nthe result of some disciplinary measure (Stuurman 2004:\n239–240). In Picardy Poulain witnessed the persecution of\nProtestants and this is often interpreted as paving the way for his\nown conversion from Catholicism to Calvinism. He left his parish in\n1688 and after a short stay in Paris, where his conversion is assumed\nto have taken place, he moved to Geneva, where he received the status\nof habitant in December 1689 (Stuurman 2004: 242–243).\nAs a resident of Geneva, Poulain continued his earlier career teaching\nFrench and in 1690 he married Marie Ravier (d. 1742), with whom he had\ntwo children, Jean-Charlotte (1690–1716) and Jean-Jacques\n(1696–1751), a future Calvinist minister and follower of many of\nhis father’s theological ideas (Welch 2002a: 17–20;\nStuurman 2004: 245–246). Poulain published two more books,\nEssai des remarques particulières sur la langue\nfrançoise pour la ville de Genève [An Essay of\ndetailed comments about the French language, for the city of Geneva]\n(1691), related to his career as a teacher, and La Doctrine des\nProtestans sur la liberté et le droit de lire l’Ecriture\nSainte, etc. [Protestant Teaching about the Freedom and the Right\nto Read the Holy Scriptures, etc.] (1720), developing his mature\ntheological opinions. He did earn a secure living in his chosen\nhomeland, though he did not find the religious freedom he appears to\nhave been hoping for. In 1693, and again in 1696, Poulain was accused\nfor being a Socinian, an accusation that was related to his\nrationalistic approach to theology, which did not draw a strict\ndistinction between theology and philosophy (Stuurman 2004:\n248–249). This affair has been seen as the main reason why\nPoulain had to wait until 1708 before he was appointed to a permanent\nteaching position at the Collège de Genève, a position\nthat he held until his death in 1723. \nPoulain’s treatises De l’égalité des\ndeux sexes and De l’éducation des dames are\nboth profoundly influenced by Descartes’ philosophy, but in\ndifferent ways. In the first treatise Descartes is not mentioned by\nname, but Poulain’s discussion of the equality between the sexes\ndraws heavily on his philosophical method as well as his metaphysics.\nThe second treatise discusses Cartesian philosophy in detail and the\nleading character Stasimachus is a proclaimed follower of Descartes,\nbut the book itself is not as evidently relying on Descartes’\nphilosophical method. My discussion of Poulain’s Cartesian\ninfluences will draw on both treatises and I will first discuss the\nrole of Cartesian method and then discuss to what extent Poulain\nadopted a Cartesian metaphysics. \nAt the very beginning of the preface to De\nl’égalité des deux sexes, Poulain writes that\nthe \nbest idea that may occur to those who try to acquire genuine\nknowledge, if they were educated according to traditional methods, is\nto doubt if they were taught well and to wish to discover the truth\nthemselves. As they make progress in this search for truth, they\ncannot avoid noticing that we are full of prejudices, and that it is\nnecessary to get rid of them completely in order to acquire clear and\ndistinct knowledge. (T1en 119; TTfr\n 53)[1] \nThis paragraph is an excellent summary of Descartes’ method for\nthe search for truth as it is presented in all his major works. In the\nDiscours de la méthode, for example, Descartes writes\nthat  \nsince I now wished to devote myself solely to the search for truth, I\nthought it necessary to […] reject as if absolutely false\neverything in which I could imagine the least doubt, in order to see\nif I was left believing anything that was entirely indubitable. (CSM\nI, 126–127; AT VI, 31–32)  \nIt is notable that Poulain’s reference to the necessity of\ngetting completely rid of prejudices follows the radical\nnature of Descartes’ doubt and its emphasis on rejecting\neverything as false, unless it is entirely indubitable.\nPoulain is true to Descartes’ terminology also at the end of the\ncited paragraph, where he refers to certain knowledge as “clear\nand distinct”. In Principia philosophiae (part I,\n§ 45), Descartes emphasizes that in order to “serve as the\nbasis for a certain and indubitable judgment” a perception needs\nto “be not merely clear but also distinct” (CSM I, 207; AT\nVIIIA, 22). By “clear” he means that “it is present\nand accessible to the attentive mind” and in order to be\n“distinct” it must, in addition to being clear, be\n“so sharply separated from all other perceptions that it\ncontains within itself only what is clear” (CSM I, 208; AT\nVIIIA, 22). \nIn De l’éducation des dames Poulain extends his\ndiscussion of methodological doubt and attributes this method to\nDescartes. The character Stasimachus explains how no other author\n“has better discussed prejudice nor countered it more\nconvincingly” (TTen 242; TTfr 277). The egalitarian aspect of\nDescartes’ method is also emphasized and Stasimachus points out\nthat “almost all of us have enough reason and good sense to seek\nthe truth”, which is found when “we have formed clear and\ndistinct ideas” (ibid.). Poulain’s text is a very close\necho of the first paragraph of Descartes’ Discours de la\nméthode, where he famously claims that  \nthe power of judging well and of distinguishing the true from the\nfalse—which is what we properly call ‘good sense’ or\n‘reason’—is naturally equal in all men. (CSM I, 111;\nAT VI, 2)  \nPoulain’s take on Descartes’ philosophy is explicitly\nmethodological and he adds that Descartes is to be trusted because he\nprovides the best “methods and principles” (TTen 242; TTfr\n277). Adopting Descartes’ method means that one has to\ncritically examine its author as well as other authors, and\nStasimachus concludes his presentation by emphasizing that \nI am not claiming that Descartes is infallible or that everything he\nproposed is true and unproblematic, or that one has to follow him\nblindly, or that others couldn’t find something as good or even\nbetter than he has left us. All I am saying is that I believe him to\nbe one of the most reasonable philosophers we have, whose method is\nthe most universal and the most natural, the one that most closely\nconforms to good sense and the nature of the human mind, and the most\nlikely to distinguish the true from the false even in the works of the\none who is their author. (TTen 243; TTfr 278) \nIn addition to Descartes’ method of doubt, Poulain also adopts\nhis scientific method and his discussion of the order of the sciences,\nas it is presented in the preface to the French translation of\nPrincipia philosophiae (see also Pellegrin 2013; Reuter 2017:\n34–37). Descartes famously compares the whole of philosophy,\nwhich is here understood as including all different forms of\nknowledge, to a tree, where the  \nroots are metaphysics, the trunk is physics, and the branches emerging\nfrom the trunk are all the other sciences, which may be reduced to\nthree principal ones, namely medicine, mechanics and morals. (CSM I,\n186; AT IXB, 14)  \nDescartes’ metaphor emphasizes the unity of the sciences and\nthis idea is taken up by Poulain, who replaces the metaphor of a tree\nwith that of the human body. In De l’éducation\nhe writes that “there is a necessary relationship and dependence\nbetween all the sciences, quite similar to those between the different\nparts of the human body” (TTen 208; TTfr 239). \nPoulain puts less emphasis than Descartes on the hierarchical\nstructure of sciences implied by the original metaphor of a tree, but\nhe does adopt Descartes’ emphasis on physics and in De\nl’égalité he uses the idea of the unity of\nthe sciences in order to argue that women are as able as men to master\nall forms of knowledge. Here Poulain is arguing against those who\nclaim that women are unable to hold civil offices and to rule over\nothers and he points out that these people \nfail to notice that the mind needs only discernment and accuracy in\nall its actions, and that anyone who displays these qualities in one\ncontext is capable of applying them as easily and in the same way to\neverything else. Morality and social science do not change the nature\nof our actions; the latter always remain physical, […] Once\nsomeone understands the laws of motion in natural philosophy, they can\napply them to all changes and all variations that occur in nature.\nSimilarly, if someone has once understood the true principles of the\nsocial sciences, they do not experience a new challenge when applying\nthem to novel situations that occur. (T1en 174; TTfr\n116–117) \nPoulain does not seem to reduce knowledge of morality to knowledge of\nphysics, but he emphasizes that there is a methodological unity, which\nmakes it possible to compare the way in which true principles are\napplied in the natural and the social sciences. His argument\ncriticizes the Scholastic tradition in two ways. First, he argues\nagainst the common view (originally presented by Aristotle) that since\nwomen’s deliberative faculty lacks sufficient authority, women\nhave difficulties governing themselves and therefore cannot govern\nothers (Aristotle, Politics 1260a12–14). Second,\nPoulain criticizes the idea, dominant among the Scholastics, that\ndifferent forms of knowledge require different methods and that\ntheoretical reasoning does not as such ground practical judgment (see\nAristotle, Nicomachean Ethics 1140b1–7, for the\ndistinction between practical reason (fronesis) and\ntheoretical knowledge). Defenders of women, who, like Christine de\nPizan, wrote within the Aristotelian tradition, found it necessary to\nargue separately that women are as capable as men in their practical\njudgment as in their theoretical reasoning (see in particular\nLivre de la Cité des Dames [The Book of the City of\nLadies], 1405, part I, chap. 43). Poulain’s argument is novel in\nits emphasis on the unity of science, from which it follows that if\nwomen are capable of theoretical reasoning, which was a less\ncontroversial claim, they are also capable of practical judgment. This\nargument is directly based on the criticism of Scholastic science that\nDescartes develops in the preface to the French translation of\nPrincipia philosophiae and which culminates in the idea of\nthe unity of all the sciences (CSM I, 185–186; AT IXB,\n12–14). \nIn Descartes’ metaphor, metaphysics constitutes the roots of the\ntree of philosophy and we must therefore assume that one cannot be a\nCartesian philosopher without adopting Descartes’ metaphysics.\nPoulain did do so, though he was, as we will see in the next section,\nless profoundly influenced by it than by Descartes’\nphilosophical methodology. \nIn the second part of De l’égalité,\nPoulain claims that “the mind has no sex” and loosely\nconnects his claim to Descartes’ dualism (T1en 157–158;\nTTfr 99–100). The claim in itself was not new—we find it\nalready in the theological doctrine of Augustine, who holds that the\nrational souls of women and men are equally created in the image of\nGod (De trinitate XII 7.12), and in Poulain’s time it had recently been stated,\nwith strong feminist emphasis, by Marie le Jars de Gournay (G-EMW 65;\nG-OC 978). Still, many of Poulain’s contemporaries as well as\nmodern scholars agree that Descartes’ dualism strengthened the\nidea that the mind has no sex (different positions have been argued by\nHoffmann 1969; Perry 1985; Harth 1992: 81–86; Atherton 1993;\nO’Neill 1999 and 2011; Broad 2002: 4–12 and 2017;\nPellegrin 2011: 28–37 and 2019: 568–569; Reuter 2013 and\n2019: 38–41; Detlefsen 2017). It might seem surprising that\nPoulain does not make more out of Descartes’ dualism than he\nactually does. \nIn the passage in question, Poulain points out that if “the mind\nis considered in itself, it […] have the same nature in all\nhuman beings” (T1en 158; TTfr 100). In order to consider the\nmind in itself one has to presuppose that it can in some respect be\ndistinguished from the body, but Poulain does not discuss the\nmetaphysical nature of the relation between mind and body. Instead he\nleaves the discussion of the mind considered in itself behind and\nfocuses on the mind-body union, which he describes in the following\nwords: \nIt is God who unites the mind with the body of a woman as with that of\na man, and who unites them by means of the same laws. This union is\nestablished and maintained by sensations, passions, and acts of the\nwill; and since the mind acts in the same way in both sexes, it is\nequally capable of the same things in both of them. (T1en 158; TTfr\n101) \nThis description is indeed very close to the description Descartes\ngives in the Sixth Meditation, when he examines “what God has\nbestowed on me as a combination of mind and body” (CSM II, 57;\nAT VII, 82), but whereas Descartes begins this last Meditation by\nemphasizing the real distinction between mind and body, according to\nwhich it “is certain that I am really distinct from my body, and\ncan exist without it” (CSM II, 54; AT VII, 78), Poulain does not\ndiscuss the real distinction between mind and body before he focuses\non their union. \nPoulain’s focus on the mind-body union is continued in De\nl’éducation, where the fourth conversation stages a\ndetailed discussion of self-knowledge. Here the young Timander, who is\nusually a spokesperson of Scholastic views, raises a significantly\nCartesian objection. He points out that  \nit would be easier to begin with the study of the mind. For if it is\neasier for man to know himself and what immediately surrounds him than\nwhat is remote from him [as has been previously established], by the\nsame token it seems that the mind would know itself better than it\nwould know the body. (TTen 214; TTfr 246; see also Welch 2002b: 139)\n \nTimander’s point resembles Descartes’ emphasis in the\nSecond Meditation, where he begins by examining himself as a thinking\nthing (CSM II, 19; AT VII, 28), but rather than following this order\nof metaphysical inquiry, Stasimachus points out that though this is\ntrue  \nprovided one can separate the mind from the body […] if we\nconsider them a single, interdependent entity […] I am\nconvinced that knowledge of the body should precede that of the mind.\n(TTen 214: TTfr 246)  \nAgain, Poulain proceeds directly to a study of the mind-body union and\nhere his reference to the distinction between mind and body is even\nmore fleeting than in De l’égalité. \nThe lack of any explicit discussion of the soul as a distinct\nsubstance has led Desmond Clarke to argue that Poulain rejected\nDescartes’ notion of the soul as a substance and held this\nnotion to be a mere Scholastic residue. According to Clarke, Poulain\ndefended the view that the  \nunion of the body and the soul and their reciprocal interdependence\nwas a more fundamental datum of human experience than the speculative\ndistinction of the soul as a scholastic substance. (Clarke 2013: 43)\n \nFollowing the same line of inquiry Marie-Frédérique\nPellegrin argues that for Poulain “anthropology is more decisive\nthan metaphysics” (Pellegrin 2019: 576). \nPoulain’s emphasis on the embodied aspect of human nature was\nnot unique among his contemporary Cartesians, on the contrary, he\nshares it with Jacques Rohault and Louis de la Forge, for example, who\nare both mentioned in his list of suggested readings presented in\nDe l’éducation (TTen 237; TTfr 272). Some\ninfluence is very likely and Clarke compares Poulain’s above\ncited account of the mind-body union in De\nl’égalité with the account de la Forge gives\nin his Traitté de l’Esprit de l’Homme\n[Treatise on the Human Mind] (1666) (T1en 158n45).\nStill, we must note that while stressing the union, de la\nForge’s account was firmly anchored in substance dualism and his\naim was to address—within a strictly Cartesian\nframework—unsolved problems related to the operations of the\nmind and the interaction between mind and body (Drieux 2019). \nPoulain’s unorthodox Cartesianism is most evident when he\ndescribes the relation between individual thoughts and the body. In\nDe l’éducation, Poulain writes that “all\nthe actions of the mind […] depend on the participation of the\nbody” and a few pages later, less rigorously, that “one\nalmost never acts without the other” (TTen 213, 223; TTfr 244,\n256). These claims overlook the distinction Descartes makes between\nthe actions and the passions of the mind, according to which passions\ndepend on the body whereas actions, such as volitions, do not (CSM I,\n335; AT XI, 342–343; for more detail see Reuter 2013:\n79–82). Poulain does acknowledge the distinction between\nvolitions and passions in one passage in De\nl’égalité, where he writes: \nAs for the causes that quicken the passions, we can understand their\nworkings as soon as we have studied physics sufficiently to understand\nhow the things that surround us affect us and influence us, and\nthrough experience and use how we can yoke our will to them or\ndissociate it from them. (TTen 84; TTfr 102; see also Broad 2017:\n76) \nThis passage relies on Descartes’ dualism by distinguishing\nbetween the passions, that are dependent on the body, and the will,\nthat is free to either yoke or dissociate itself. But again there is\nno further discussion and Poulain seems to be unaware of the\nmetaphysical dimension of the distinction he makes. \nPoulain does not seem to hold that there is a necessary\ndependence of mind upon body. He is not explicitly arguing for a\nmaterialist alternative to Descartes’ dualism, but rather\nemphasizing the interdependence between mind and body, without taking\nan explicit stand on what kind of metaphysical foundation this\ninteraction requires. Poulain was young when he wrote his feminist\ntreatises and though he was evidently familiar with a wide range of\nCartesian topics, it is possible that he was not very deeply read in\nthe Cartesian corpus. Compared to other Cartesians such as Rohault, de\nla Forge, Nicolas Malebranche, and Antoine Arnauld, Poulain did not\ncontribute by examining unsolved problems in Descartes’ physics\nand metaphysics. Instead, his unrivalled contribution lies in his\nCartesian analyses of the moral, political, physical, and metaphysical\nrelations between the sexes. \nPoulain’s analysis of the subjugation of women combines a\nCartesian criticism of prejudice with a historical analysis of the\norigin of these prejudiced opinions. \nRight at the beginning of the first part of De\nl’égalité, Poulain compares prejudice\nconcerning the sexes to other equally persistent, but unjustified\nbeliefs. First, he points out that apart  \nfrom a few scholars, everyone thinks that it is indubitable that the\nSun moves around the Earth, despite the fact that what we observe in\nthe revolutions of the days and the years leads those who examine it\nto believe that it is the Earth that moves around the Sun. (T1en 122;\nTTfr 59)  \nSecond, he refers to people, who imagine that animals are intelligent\nbeings guided by reason, just  \nlike primitive people who suppose that there are little souls inside\nthe clocks and machines that they are shown though they know nothing\nabout their construction or their inner springs. (T1en 122–123;\nTTfr 59)  \nFinally, and perhaps most interestingly, Poulain refers to social\nprejudices, which cause people to believe that their own country is\nthe best, because it is most familiar, and  \nthat the religion in which they were reared is the true religion that\nmust be followed, even if they may never have thought of examining it\nor comparing it with other religious traditions. (T1en 123; TTfr 60)\n \nThese social prejudices also include beliefs concerning wealth and\nrank, and Poulain points out that “the unequal distribution of\ngoods and offices causes many people to conclude that human beings are\nnot equal to each other” (ibid.). \nPoulain’s comparisons place his analysis of the relations\nbetween the sexes in the framework of new science, including both\nastronomy and mechanistic explanations of the animal body, as well as\nin the framework of current ideas about religious freedom and human\nequality. He claims that when properly examined, the equality of the\nsexes should be as evident as the newly established fact that the\nearth moves around the sun. \nPoulain continues by emphasizing that when one examines the\nfoundations of prejudice one finds that these beliefs are based on\nmere self-interest and custom. Interestingly, he is also quite aware\nthat beliefs based on prejudice are more difficult to change than\nbeliefs based on reason. He points out that when  \nsomeone’s opinion is based only on prejudice, it is incomparably\nmore difficult to change their minds than if they had been convinced\nby reasons that seem strong and persuasive to them. (T1en 123; TTfr\n60)  \nPeople can make mistakes when they think that they have strong\nevidence to believe what they believe, but people who make this kind\nof mistakes are more prone to change their minds when they encounter\nnew evidence than people who hold untrue beliefs based on prejudice (for an excellent discussion of Poulain’s Cartesian analysis of prejudice, see Schmitter 2018; also Fraisse 1985).\nThe persistance of prejudice is an important insight, which is still very relevant for\ndiscussions about our “post-truth” society and different forms of populist rhetoric. \nWhen discussing prejudices about the inferiority of women, Poulain\nemphasizes that these are particularly difficult to overcome because\nthey are shared by both men and women. He writes that these beliefs,\nthough unjustified, seem \nall the more convincing when one considers how women themselves\ntolerate their condition. They accept it as if it were natural to\nthem, either because they do not think at all about what they are or\nbecause, having been born and reared in dependency, they think about\nit in the same way as men. (T1en 126; TTfr 63) \nHere Poulain touches upon the important—and also still\nrelevant—topic of internalized prejudice (also Schmitter 2018, 6–9). The subjugation of\nwomen does not consist only in the political and economic power men\nexercise over them, but also in the fact that women internalize their\nsubjected position and perceive it as natural. In twenty-first\ncentury feminist philosophy this same insight provides the ground for\ndiscussions about the objectification of women (Haslanger 1993;\nLangton 2000) as well as about implicit biases and so called\nstereotype threat, which can affect the performance of disadvantaged\ngroups in situations where they identify themselves as inadequate\nperformers (Saul 2013). \nSince subjection is in part based on false self-understanding, Poulain\nis very aware that we need true self-knowledge in order to liberate\nourselves. In De l’égalité he points out\nthat “[s]elf-knowledge is absolutely necessary in order to\naddress [the equality of the sexes] properly” and following his\nemphasis on the bodily aspect of the human condition, he adds that\nthis concerns “especially knowledge of the body” (T1en\n155; TTfr 97). In De l’éducation, Poulain\ndevotes the whole fourth conversation to the topic of self-knowledge\nand though he does not in this context explicitly address the question\nof the equality of the sexes, he makes several important remarks on\nhow our self-knowledge is affected by the prejudiced opinions of\nothers. Stasimachus explains: \nWe are prejudiced about nearly everything that exists, and most of all\nabout ourselves. We are not only the authors of the prejudice but also\nits theater and its victims. As far as the things that touch us most\nclosely are concerned, we immolate ourselves to our ghosts, so to\nspeak. […] Although we are made in a certain way, and nature\nmakes us realize that and protests constantly against our own\nimagination, we still try to be the way people tell us we are. (TTen\n212; TTfr 243) \nPoulain’s account is remarkably aware of what we would call the\nunconscious aspects of our minds and of the difficulties to change our\nself-conception even in cases when we consciously know that we are the\nvictim of prejudice. He was clearly aware of the ongoing French\ndiscussion of self-knowledge, where Neo-Augustinian thinkers such as\nPierre Nicole and Blaise Pascal questioned its possibility, and he\ncombined a defense of the achievability of self-knowledge against\nthose who claim that knowing oneself is  \nlike moving mountains and that we will never get to the end of it,\nthat man is hidden from himself, that there are countless hidden\nrecesses of the heart he can never uncover (TTen 211; TTfr 242)  \nwith a nuanced awareness of the difficulties involved (for a detailed\ndiscussion see Reuter 2017: 44–49). \nPoulain’s finely tuned analysis of the psychological aspects of\noppression is combined with a robust analysis of the historical origin\nof the prejudiced opinion that women are inferior to men. He explains\nthat we need to trace the prejudiced opinion about women “back\nto its origin” and that would \ninvolve evaluating what was done in earlier times by reference to\ncurrent practices, and judging ancient customs by comparison with\nthose that we see developing in our own day. If we had followed that\nrule, we would not have fallen into so many mistakes in innumerable\njudgments. And, in respect of the current condition of women, we would\nhave recognized that they were dominated only by the law of the\nstrongest, and that it was not because of a lack of natural capacity\nor merit on their part that they failed to share the advantages that\ngive men a superior position in society. (T1en 126; TTfr\n63–64) \nAccording to Poulain, the law of the stronger (la Loi du plus\nfort) is in several respects arbitrary. He emphasizes that with\nthe exception for the dependence of children upon their parents,\ndependence “is a purely physical or civil relation” and it\nshould be “considered only as an effect of change, violence, or\ncustom” (T1en 153; TTfr 95). As argued by Stuurman, Poulain can\nhave been influenced by Thomas Hobbes’ views about the\nartificial nature of political power (Stuurman 2004: 177–178).\nInequality is not natural and neither is the male sex oppressive by\nnature. Poulain explicitly rejects the idea that men, when they\nusurped power over women, were “driven by some hidden\ninstinct—that is, by a general command of the author of\nnature—to act in this way” (T1en 126; TTfr 63). God has\nnot made men oppressive. From the arbitrary nature of the power\nrelation between the sexes follows also that “women might have\n[favored their sex] had they been in a similar situation” (T1en\n152; TTfr 95). Neither sex is by its nature oppressive or\nsubmissive. \nPoulain does not deny that men are, on an average, physically stronger\nthan women or that “the interruptions of pregnancy and its\nafter-effects reduced the strength of women for periods of time”\nand made them dependent on “their husbands’\nassistance” (T1en 127; TTfr 65). This was not a problem, though,\nas long as “families consisted of just a mother, a father, and a\nfew small children” but it became problematic when families\nexpanded into larger units, when household chores became more\ndiversified and all family members submitted to the rule of the father\n(T1en 127–128; TTfr 65). \nPoulain is committed to the idea of an original golden age, preceding\nthe present diversified society, and he emphasizes the idea of\noriginal liberty in particular in his third treatise De\nl’excellence des hommes, where he also describes the\nprocess through which natural liberty was lost. He explains that\nwhen \nsome men took advantage of their strength and their leisure to try to\nsubjugate others, the golden age of liberty gave way to an iron age of\nservitude. Self-interest and wealth were so bound together through\ndomination that it became impossible not to have to depend on others.\nThis combination increased in proportion to the distance from the\nstate of innocence and peace, giving rise to greed, ambition, vanity,\nextravagance, idleness, pride, cruelty, tyranny, deceit, schisms,\nwars, chance, worries—in short, all the infirmities of mind and\nbody that afflict us. (TTen 313; TTfr 392) \nLike Jean-Jacques Rousseau after him, Poulain connects the origins of\ninequality to wealth and the dependence on others that follows from an\nincreasing division of labor. This historical process does not only\ngive raise to unequal material conditions, it is also the origin of\nnegative emotions such as greed, pride and cruelty. The tyranny of men\nover women has the same historical origin. In De\nl’égalité Poulain describes how the original\nvoluntary dependence between husband and wife becomes subjugation when\nwars forced women “to accept as husbands unknown strangers who\nconsidered them merely as the most beautiful part of their\nbooty” (T1en 128; TTfr 66). The commodification of women is\nthus, according to Poulain, an integral part of the historical\norigin of inequality. \nPoulain’s understanding of the difference between the original\nharmony of mother, father and a few children and the oppression of\nwomen in developed societies is further illuminated by his remarks on\nthe difference between marriage and political society. In De\nl’excellence he compares political society and the\n“society of marriage [which] is composed only of two persons, of\nwhom one, therefore, cannot use authority and coercion towards the\nother” (TTen 280; TTfr 313). Poulain argues that marriage does\nnot require a hierarchical division of power because it is “not\nfounded on fear, but on love” (ibid.). Marriage can thus be\nbased directly on the natural equality of wife and husband, without\neither of them usurping power over the other, whereas a society of\nthree or more people, where one is “able to join forces with\nanother to force the third to abide”, requires submission to\nlaws and sovereigns, otherwise people will “be constantly at\nwar” (ibid). In order to avoid war and tyranny established\nthrough war, political society requires sovereign power, but like\nHobbes, Poulain emphasizes that the right to command  \ndoes not belong naturally to any one person more than to another,\nsince it consists in the voluntary submission of those who give it to\nthe one who is vested with it. (ibid.)  \nBoth marriage and political rule must thus acknowledge that human\nbeings are naturally equal, even if political society cannot be based\non natural equality in the same direct manner as marriage\ncan—and was, according to Poulain, during the golden age of\nliberty, before the arbitrary subjugation of women. \nWe have seen that Poulain claims that all human beings are equal, but\nhow does he argue for the equality of the sexes? We do not know if\nPoulain was familiar with Marie de Gournay’s treatise\nÉgalité des hommes et des femmes [The Equality\nof Men and Women] (1622), but he shares her emphasis on equality based\non the similarity of the sexes. Gournay self-consciously distinguished\nherself from earlier participants in the querelle des femmes,\nwho often argued for the superiority of either sex, and emphasizes\nthat she is “content to make women equal to men, for nature is\nalso as opposed to superiority as to inferiority in this\nrespect” (G-EMW 54; G-OC 965; see also Deslauriers 2018).\nWhereas Gournay followed Aristotle and argued that the unique form of\nthe human animal consists in the rational soul, which is the same in\nboth sexes (G-EMW 65; G-OC 978; also Deslauriers 2019), Poulain\nrejected Scholastic philosophy and attempted to ground most of his\narguments on Descartes’ philosophy. When we analyze his\ndiscussions of the equality of the sexes, we can distinguish four main\narguments. First, Poulain argues that there is no evidence in favor of\ninequality, which is a mere false belief. Second, he argues that women\nand men are in all relevant respects mentally and physically similar\nand therefor equal. Third, he refers to a normative concept of natural\nequality, and finally, he develops a normative demand for equal\nopportunity. I have devoted one subsection to each argument. \nThis argument is based on Descartes’ method for the search of\ntruth\n (section 2.1)\n and closely connected to Poulain’s criticism of prejudice\n (section 3.1).\n It is Poulain’s most substantial argument in the sense that a\nlarge part of De l’égalité consists of\nhis refutations of claims about the inferiority of women. Poulain\nargues that beliefs about women are not based on women’s essence\nor nature, but historically constructed prejudices\n (section 3.2).\n Desmond Clarke, in particular, has emphasized this aspect of\nPoulain’s criticism and connected it to a general Cartesian\ncriticism of Scholastic explanatory models, which explain “any\nphenomenon simply by postulating a ‘form’ or\n‘nature’ that corresponds to each reality that needs to be\nexplained” (Clarke 2013: 41). Poulain’s criticism of a\nscholastic notion of ‘nature’ is most explicit in a\npassage where he argues against “Lawyers’ opinions”,\nwhich carry “a lot of weight for many people because they\nprofess specifically to give everyone their due” (T1en 152; TTfr\n94). These Scholastic lawyers, among whom scholars claim that Poulain\nincludes Hugo Grotius (Stuurman 2004: 166–167), say “that\nit is nature that assigns women to the lowest functions in society and\nremoves them from public offices”, but they would, according to\nPoulain,  \nbe hard pressed if they were required to explain intelligibly what\nthey mean by ‘nature’ in this context, and to explain how\nnature distinguished the two sexes, as they claim. (T1en 152; TTfr\n94–95)  \nPoulain argues that ‘nature’ is, in this context, a\nnon-explanatory concept. We can compare his criticism with that of\nGournay: whereas she argues that when correctly interpreted, the\nScholastic concept of the human being does not allow for a distinction\nof sex, he argues that this kind of concept cannot explain the true\nnature of the sexes in the first place. \nPoulain also argues that inequality is a false belief by giving\nnumerous examples of the equal and even superior abilities of women.\nMany of these examples are speculative generalizations, which would\nnot satisfy Cartesian criteria for certainty. Poulain writes, for\nexample, that it  \nis a pleasure to hear a woman pleading a legal case. No matter how\ncomplicated a case may be, she unravels it and explains it clearly.\n[…] One finds throughout women’s conduct of legal cases a\ncertain competence that men lack. (T1en 139; TTfr 79)  \nThe generalization made here is not valid and does in fact resemble\nthe generalizations about women’s inferiority that Poulain is\nattacking. But we must also note that he does not need more than one\nexample of a woman who pleads her case well in order to show that\nwomen are not by their nature unable to do so. In this sense\nhis generalizations are superfluous. Poulain seems to be aware of this\nphilosophically more valid aspect of arguing from examples when he\nwrites: \nJust as it is rather unfair to believe that all women are indiscreet\nsimply because one knows five or six who are such, one should be\nequally fair and conclude that women are capable of scientific study\nbecause one sees that a number of them have been able to raise\nthemselves to such heights. (T1en 142; TTfr 82) \nEven here Poulain is not completely clear about the crucial difference\nbetween invalid generalizations from examples and the valid use of\nexamples in order to show that a given generalization is untrue. But\nhe allows for a generous interpretation according to which his primary\naim is to show that generalizations about the inferiority of women are\nfalse. \nIn addition to showing that claims about inequality are false, Poulain\naims to show that the sexes are equal, because they are in all\nrelevant respects similar. In the second part of De l’égalité, this argument is placed under the subtitle\nWomen, when considered from the perspective of the principles of\nsound philosophy, are as capable as men of every kind of\nknowledge and begins with the above (in\n section 2.2)\n cited claim that “the mind has no sex” (T1en 157; TTfr\n99). Poulain argues: \nIt is easy to see that sexual differences apply only to the body.\nSince, strictly speaking, the body alone is involved in the\nreproduction of human beings and the mind merely gives its assent and\ndoes so in the same manner in everyone, it follows that the mind has\nno sex. (T1en 157; TTfr 99–100) \nHere, Poulain is primarily concerned with the nature of the mind, but\nthe way he connects reproduction and assent is also noteworthy and\ncorresponds to his emphasis, in De l’exellence, that\nwhen a woman and a man “agree to live together it is purely\nvoluntary” (TTen 280; TTfr 313; see also De\nl’égalité, T1en 153; TTfr 95). From his claim\nabout equal consent, Poulain draws the conclusion that if “the\nmind is considered in itself, it is found to be equal and to have the\nsame nature in all human beings, and to be capable of every kind of\nthought” (T1en 158; TTfr 100; see also\n section 2.2). \nThe equality of independent minds is not enough, though, since human\nbeings are compounds of minds and bodies. Minds are constantly\naffected by bodies. Therefore Poulain continues by arguing that the\nbodies of the sexes are also similar in all cognitively relevant respects. He claims that this is particularly true of the brain: \n[The fact that the mind functions no differently in one sex than in\nthe other] is even clearer if one considers only the head, which is\nthe unique organ of scientific knowledge and in which the mind\nexercises all its functions. Even with the most detailed anatomical\ninvestigations, we cannot observe any difference in this organ between\nmen and women. The brains of the latter are completely similar to\nours; they receive and combine sensory impressions there in the same\nway as we do, and they store them for the imagination and memory in\nexactly the same way. (T1en 158; TTfr 101) \nThe problem with an argument based on the similarity of cognitive\norgans such as the brain, is that it makes equality dependent on\nempirical findings. The “most detailed anatomical\ninvestigations” to which Poulain refers was not very advanced\naccording to today’s standards and the contemporary Cartesian\nMalebranche drew different conclusions about women’s brains,\nincluding their imaginations (see also Clarke 2013: 44, 50).\nMalebranche does not claim that all women have weaker capacities than\nall men, quite the contrary: “some women are found to have\nstronger minds than some men”, but he argues that most women\n“cannot use their imagination for working out complex and\ntangled questions” and connects this inability to the\n“delicacy of the brain fibers [that] is the principal cause of\nall these effects” (Malebranche 1674–75 [1997: 130]).\nPresent day brain research is more advanced, but has still not settled\nthe question of whether there are cognitively significant differences\nbetween women and men. Considered as a philosophical argument, an\nappeal to brain research remains weak. In order to avoid reducing the\nquestion of mental capacity to a question to be answered by brain\nscientists, we need a concept of the mind that cannot be reduced to\nthe physiological body. \nEven if Poulain emphasizes the similarity of the cognitively\nsignificant physical organs of women and men, he does not seem to want\nto provide a thoroughly materialist account (see also\n section 2.2).\n Jacqueline Broad has developed a nuanced interpretation of\nPoulain’s position, where she emphasizes the role of the free\nwill and in particular its capacity to assent or dissent (Broad 2017:\n74–76). Descartes famously argued that a judgment consists of\ntwo elements: a perception of the intellect and an action of the will.\nIn order to avoid error, the will must assent only to those\nperceptions that are clear and distinct (e.g., Principia\n§§ 32–35; CSM I, 204; AT VIIIA, 17–18).\nAccording to this account it is ultimately the will which is\nresponsible when we err. Broad’s interpretation builds on the\npassage in De l’égalité where Poulain\nclaims that “we can yoke our will to [the causes of the\npassions] or dissociate it from them” (TTen 84; TTfr 102; see\nalso\n section 2.2).\n She argues that  \nlike Descartes, Poullain suggests that agents are capable of\novercoming the influence of their bodies through the exercise of free\nwill: they might either “yoke” their will to the causes of\ntheir passions or “dissociate” it from them. (Broad 2017:\n76; on Descartes’ and Poulain’s\naccounts of judgment, see also Reuter 2013: 79–80) \nBroad’s interpretation captures Poulain’s egalitarian\nintentions and an account built on the independence of the will has\nthe obvious advantage that even if there would be empirically\ndetectable differences in how women and men are influenced by their\nbodies, they may share an equal freedom of will to assent or dissent\nto their passions as well as imaginings (see also Reuter 2019:\n49–51). The philosophical problem with this account is that it\nleaves Poulain’s position open to the objections raised most\nprominently by Elisabeth of Bohemia in her correspondence with\nDescartes. On 22 June 1645 she writes: \nI know well that in removing everything upsetting to me (which I\nbelieve to be represented only by the imagination) from the idea of an\naffair, I would judge it healthily and would find in it the remedies\nas well as the affection which I bring to it. But I have never known\nhow to put this into practice until the passion has already played its\nrole. (Shapiro [ed.] 2007: 93; AT IV, 233–234) \nElisabeth is describing her inability to dissociate her will from the\naffairs that affect her. This lack of ability is not due to a lack of\nknowledge about how external influences act on her, quite the\ncontrary, she is well aware of the roles played by the passions and\nthe imagination, but argues that regardless of her knowledge, she is\nunable to voluntarily dissociate her assent. In this letter Elisabeth\nis arguing from her personal experience, but her criticism is framed\nby the metaphysical questions she raised in her early letters. In her\nsecond letter (10 June 1643) she summarizes the point: \nit is altogether very difficult to understand that a soul, as you have\ndescribed it, after having had the faculty and the custom of reasoning\nwell, can lose all of this by some vapors, and that, being able to\nsubsist without the body, and having nothing in common with it, the\nsoul is still so governed by it. (Shapiro [ed.] 2007: 68; AT III,\n685) \nElisabeth raises the question of how it is possible that the mind can\nbe simultaneously distinct from and affected by the body. These are\nexactly the kind of metaphysical worries that Poulain leaves\nunaddressed, with the consequence that he is unable to provide a valid\nmetaphysical basis for his claims about the similarity of the\nsexes. \nRegardless of how successfully Poulain is able to show the similarity\nbetween the intellectual capacities of women and men, such descriptive\nsimilarity provides a weak—if any—foundation for a\nnormative concept of equality (also Clarke 2013: 49; Hoekstra 2013).\nIn order to find a normative basis for Poulain’s claim about the\nequality of the sexes I will first look at his references to the\nnatural equality and liberty of humankind. In De\nl’égalité, Poulain writes that\n“dependence and servitude are contrary to the law of nature\nwhich makes all men equal” (TTen 78; TTfr 95) and a few pages\nlater he points out that when humans are imagined separate from civil\nsociety, they are found “completely free and equal, with only a\ndesire for self-preservation and an equal right to everything that\nwould be necessary to achieve it” (T1en 164; TTfr 106). Poulain\ndoes not elaborate on what he means by the law of nature or by the\nstate of nature preceding civil society. It is not clear to what\nextent he is relying on the Scholastic tradition of natural law, which\nhe would have known from his studies at Sorbonne, and to what extent\nhe is inspired by more recent developments, such as the natural law\ntheory of Hugo Grotius and Thomas Hobbes. \nBoth passages cited above are situated in contexts that do have\nHobbesian connotations: in the first case Poulain is distinguishing\nnatural equality from the arbitrary nature of dependence in the civil\nstate (see also\n section 3.2)\n and in the second case he continues: \nBut [the woman studying law and politics] would also notice that this\nequality would involve them in war or a permanent state of mutual\ndistrust, which would be inconsistent with their objective, and that\nthe natural light of reason would dictate that they could not live in\npeace unless everyone surrendered their rights and made contracts or\nconventions. She would also see that, in order to validate these\ndecisions and to protect people from anxiety, it would be necessary to\nhave recourse to a third party who would have authority to force\neveryone to observe what they had promised to others. (T1en 164; TTfr\n106; see also Hobbes, Leviathan, part I, chap.\n13–15) \nOn these grounds, and considering which works were available in\nPoulain’s intellectual context, Stuurman concludes that\n“Hobbes is his most likely source” (2004: 177). The\nprobable influence of Hobbes is very illuminating, in particular when\nwe consider Poulain’s view of the arbitrary nature of power, but\nStuurman seems to overemphasize the Hobbesian nature of\nPoulain’s views when he indicates that Poulain rejects natural\nsociability (Stuurman 2004: 178). Poulain does indeed emphasize the\nrole of fear as a motive for political society in De\nl’égalité (T1en 164; TTfr 106) as well as\nDe l’excellence (TTen 280; TTfr 313), but it is crucial\nto note that he does not consider fear to be a necessary aspect of the\nnatural condition of humankind. The description of “the golden\nage of liberty”, which Poulain gives in De\nl’excellence, is a description of natural sociability: \nAt the dawn of the world, traces of which are still to be seen in the\ninnocent loves of shepherds and shepherdesses and in the pleasures of\nthe rustic life, which is untroubled by the fear of powers or enemies,\nall men were equal, just, and sincere, since their only rule and law\nwas that of good sense. (TTen 313; TTfr 392) \nAs we can see, fear does not exist in this original state, it is\nintroduced as a consequence of “some men [taking] advantage of\ntheir strength and their leisure to try to subjugate others”\n(ibid.; see also the passage cited in\n section 3.2).\n Poulain does claim that humans have “a desire for\nself-preservation and an equal right to everything that would be\nnecessary to achieve it” (T1en 164; TTfr 106), but when we\nconsider his writings as a whole, he does not seem to claim that this\ndesire is in itself the origin of constant confrontations and the fear\nraised by these confrontations. \nPoulain’s discussions of natural equality and liberty in De\nl’excellence are framed by theological references,\nincluding a reference to “St. Augustine, who claims that man\nshould place nothing above himself save God alone” (TTen 279;\nTTfr 312; also Wilkin 2019: 234–236). Poulain may have in mind a\npassage in De civitate Dei (book XIX, chap. 15), where\nAugustine writes: \nGod wanted rational man, made to his image, to have no dominion except\nover irrational nature. He meant no man, therefore, to have dominion\nover man, but only man over beast. So it fell out that those who were\nholy in primitive times became shepherds over sheep rather than\nmonarchs over men, […]. (Augustine 413–427 [2008:\n223]) \nKinch Hoekstra, among others, has emphasized that this chapter from\nDe civitate Dei, as well as a passage in De doctrina\nChristiana (book I, chap. 23), where Augustine states that human beings are naturally\nequal, influenced discussions about natural equality and liberty well\ninto the seventeenth century (Hoekstra 2013: 95). When we look for the\nnormative basis of Poulain’s claim that all humans are equal\n(shepherds and all), this theological origin, deriving equality from\nthe creation of humankind, is at least as probable as Hobbes’\naccount of equality (for an influential interpretation of the\nnormative nature of the latter, see Hoekstra 2013). Here we do not\nfind a definite break with the scholastic tradition. Poulain is using\nits concept of equality in order to argue—against many\nScholastic authors—that natural equality must be applied to the\nrelation between women and men. \nDesmond Clarke and Jacqueline Broad both emphasize that\nPoulain’s concept of equality is normative in the sense that it\nincludes a demand for equal opportunity. According to Clarke\nwe find in Poulain (and other seventeenth-century feminist authors) a\n“claim to the effect that all persons should enjoy equal access\nto certain human goods” (2013: 49). This demand is in itself\ndependent on the idea that people are in some relevant respect equal\nand in the case of Poulain we can see that his demand for equal\nopportunity is rooted in his discussions of ability\n (section 4.2)\n as well as his notion of natural equality\n (section 4.3). \nBroad points at a passage in De l’égalité\nwhere Poulain’s demand for equal right is clearly put:\n“all of us, men or women, have an equal right to truth since the\nminds of both are equally able to apprehend it” (TTen 91; TTfr\n111). Here the connection between equal right and equal ability is\nexplicit and we can see why it is so urgent for Poulain to show that\nwomen and men have equal minds. The claim that there are no relevant\ndifferences between the minds of women and men is not in itself\nnormative, but provides a basis for demanding the equal right to\nexercise ones mind. As Broad shows, Poulain’s demand for an\nequal right to truth is closely connected to the pursuit of virtue and\nultimately of true happiness, that can be achieved only through virtue\n(Broad 2017: 79; 2019: 32). Poulain writes that “[s]ince the two\nsexes are capable of the same happiness, they have the same right to\neverything that may be used to acquire it” (T1en 169; TTfr\n111). \nIt is important to note, as Broad does, that Poulain, following\nDescartes almost word by word, defines virtue as “a firm and\nstable resolve to do what one thinks is best in various\ncircumstances” (T1en 187; TTfr 131; also Descartes’ letter\nto Elisabeth of 4 August 1645, Shapiro [ed.] 2007: 98; AT IV, 265).\nFrom this emphasis on resolve follows that we do not need to assume\nthat the will is always actually able to yoke itself to or dissociate\nitself from the passions (see\n section 4.2):\n it is sufficient to make a resolute attempt in order to be virtuous.\nPoulain’s claim that women and men have an equal ability of\nresolution, an ability he explicitly claims belongs to the mind and\ndepends on the body only as its instrument (T1en 187; TTfr 131), is\nthus valid regardless of whether the sexes are actually able to\nsimilarly govern their passions (even if he holds that the second\nclaim is also true). An equal ability of resolution is in itself\nenough as a basis for the demand that women and men have an equal\nright to knowledge and all other additional means of achieving full\nvirtue and thereby, according to Poulain, happiness. (There is an\nextensive scholarly discussion of exactly how Descartes connects\nvirtue and happiness; for a recent account see Svensson 2019.) \nPoulain’s demand for an equal right to knowledge is in effect a\ndemand for an equal right to proper education. When Poulain refers to\neducation, it is most often in order to lament “the minimal\neducation that women are given” (T1en 196; TTfr 141). In De\nl’égalité he argues that if we conceive a\nlack of cognitive ability in women, that “should be attributed\nuniquely to the conditions in which they live and the education they\nare given, which include the ignorance in which they are left”\n(T1en 188; TTfr 132–133; see also G-EMW 59–60; G-OC\n971–972). But Poulain’s criticism of the current state of\naffairs includes a demand for change and right at the beginning of the\nfirst conversation in De l’éducation,\nStasimachus points out: “as I think it absolutely essential to\nhave an education, I would organize things in such a way that women\ncould get one as easily as men” (TTen 144; TTfr 163). Following\nfrom Poulain’s Cartesian criticism of the Scholastic\ninstitutions of learning, articulated in detail by Stasimachus,\neducation is pictured as a private enterprise and the outline of\nDe l’éducation, five conversations set in\nSophia’s private home, can be read as Poulain’s example of\nthe ideal form of education. In this setting equality is emphasized by\nthe fact that we have one learned person of each sex, Stasimachus and\nSophia, and one eager pupil of each sex, Eulalia and Timander (on the roles of the four characters, see Schmitter 2018, 7–9). \nThe topic of education is also the topic that Poulain most evidently\nshares with many of his predecessors as well as successors. The\nquestion was forcefully raised by Christine de Pizan in Le Livre\nde la Cité des Dames (part I, chap. 27), where she argues\nthat  \nif it were the custom to send little girls to school and to teach them\nall sorts of different subjects there, as one does with little boys,\nthey would grasp and learn the difficulties of all the arts and\nsciences just as easily as the boys do, (Christine 1405 [1999: 57])\n \nand is still an essential theme in Mary Wollstonecraft’s A\nVindication of the Rights of Woman (1792). \nPoulain’s feminist treatises did not have a large following in\nFrance, but neither were they without impact. There were some\nauthorized as well as unauthorized re-editions (for a complete list\nsee Alcover 1981; also Welch 2002a: 25–31), but the references\nto his works are scarce. One exception is Gabrièle Suchon, who\nmentions “the author of the Equality” in her\nTraité de la morale et de la politique [Treatise on ethics and politics] (1693), where she defends women’s liberty as well as capacity of learning (Welch 2002a: 29; Shapiro 2017; Wilkin 2019). In the next\ncentury Louise Dupin cites Poulain in her unfinished manuscript Ouvrage\nsur les femmes [Work on Women] (ca. 1745), and we have direct evidence that Montesquieu spoke highly of De\nl’égalité (Thielemann 1983: 321–326;\nStuurman 2004: 283–289; Wilkin 2019). It is also very likely\nthat Rousseau, who was working as Dupin’s secretary while she\nworked on her manuscript, was familiar with at least Poulain’s\nfirst treatise. \nAlready in 1677, De l’égalité was\nanonymously published in English translation under the name The\nWoman as Good as the Man and Poulain’s thoughts, if not his\nname, seems to have influenced English discussions of the equality of\nthe sexes well into the eighteenth century (Leduc 2010; Clarke 2013:\n12–13). One important mediator was the treatise Woman Not\nInferior to Man: or, A short and modest Vindication of the natural\nRight of the FAIR-SEX to a perfect Equality of Power, Dignity, and\nEsteem, with the Men (1739), published under the pseudonym\n“Sophia, A Person of Quality”. This treatise, which has\nonly recently received attention from scholars, appropriated several\npassages from Poulain’s treatise and radicalized his claims into\nan even more explicit demand for the rights of women (Clarke 2013:\n43–44; Broad 2019). We do not yet know enough about the\nreception history of Sophia’s treatise, or about\nWollstonecraft’s use of sources, in order to be able to even\nguess if there was a direct influence between the two vindications of\nthe rights of women, but Broad has recently shown that we can detect a\ncontinuity in the topic of dignity as the foundation for women’s\nrights that stretches from Poulain to Wollstonecraft (Broad 2019). \nWhen we consider Poulain’s influence in France during the\neighteenth century, we must take into account that the idea of\nequality based on the similarity of the sexes was much more contested\nthan in England. In Émile (1762), Rousseau famously\nclaims:  \nhow vain are disputes as to whether one of the two sexes is superior\nor whether they are equal—as though each, in fulfilling\nnature’s ends according to its own particular purpose were\nthereby less perfect than if it resembled the other more!. (1762\n[1979: 358]; 2012: 825)  \nRousseau argued that the sexes are neither equal nor unequal, they are\ndifferent, and should aim at perfecting their differences in order to\nform a harmonious couple. Poulain’s demand for equality based on similarity was something to be argued against rather than adopted. Though\nRousseau’s views on the relations between the sexes were heavily\ncriticized by English feminists such as Wollstonecraft (Reuter 2014),\nthey influenced many French feminists (Bergès 2016). When\nOlympe de Gouges declares the rights of women during the French\nRevolution, she does not appeal to the similarity of the sexes, but to\ntheir harmonious union, which is fulfilled by all other animals except\nhumans. In her famous Les droits de la femme. A La Reine [The\nrights of women. To the Queen] (1791), she writes, addressing\ntyrannical men,  \ndistinguish, if you can, between the sexes in the workings of nature.\nEverywhere you will find them intermixed; everywhere they cooperate in\nthis immortal masterpiece with a harmonious togetherness. (1791 [2011:\n30]; 1993: 206)  \nWe do hear an echo from the golden age of liberty, but it is an echo\nformed by Rousseau’s emphasis on the harmonious union of the\nsexes. \nDuring the early decades of the twentieth century there was a new\ninterest in what was seen as the history of feminist thought,\nactualized by the hotly debated question of women suffrage, and this\nresulted in some early scholarly essays on Poulain (Grappin 1913,\n1914; Lefevre 1914). In 1949 Simone de Beauvoir made Poulain’s\nname known when she (rather freely) cites his phrase “one should\nbe suspicious of everything that men have said about women because\nthey are both judges and litigants” (T1en 151; TTfr 93) as a\nmotto for her Le deuxième sexe [The second sex].\nPoulain is more than a motto for Beauvoir and when discussing facts\nand myths about women, she describes his analysis in the following\nwords: \n[Poulain] thinks that since men are stronger, they favor their sex and\nwomen accept this dependence out of custom. They never had their\nchances: in either freedom or education. Thus they cannot be judged by\nwhat they did in the past. Nothing indicates their inferiority to men.\nAnatomy reveals differences, but none of them constitutes a privilege\nfor the male. (Beauvoir 1949/1989: 184–185 [2011: 123–124]) \nIn addition to being an excellent summary of Poulain’s argument,\nthis passage is an interesting key to Beauvoir’s own analysis of\nhow women become the second sex (see also Welch 2002a: 32; on\nCartesian aspects of Beauvoir’s thought, see Heinämaa\n2005).","contact.mail":"anna.m.reuter@jyu.fi","contact.domain":"jyu.fi"}]
