Distinguished\nscholars, such as Arthur Lovejoy, Northrop Frye and Isaiah Berlin,\nhave remarked on the notorious challenges facing any attempt to define\nromanticism. Lovejoy, for example, claimed that romanticism is\n“the scandal of literary history and criticism” (1960:\n234). The main difficulty in studying the romantics, according to him,\nis the lack of any “single real entity, or type of entity”\nthat the concept “romanticism” designates. Lovejoy\nconcluded, “the word ‘romantic’ has come to mean so\nmany things that, by itself, it means nothing” (1960: 235).\n\n\nThe more specific task of characterizing romantic aesthetics\nadds to these difficulties an air of paradox. Conventionally,\n“aesthetics” refers to a theory concerning beauty and art\nor the branch of philosophy that studies these topics. However, many\nof the romantics rejected the identification of aesthetics with a\ncircumscribed domain of human life that is separated from the\npractical and theoretical domains of life. The most characteristic\nromantic commitment is to the idea that the character of art and\nbeauty and of our engagement with them should shape all aspects of\nhuman life. Being fundamental to human existence, beauty and art\nshould be a central ingredient not only in a philosophical or artistic\nlife, but also in the lives of ordinary men and women. Another\nchallenge for any attempt to characterize romantic aesthetics lies in\nthe fact that most of the romantics were poets and artists whose views\nof art and beauty are, for the most part, to be found not in developed\ntheoretical accounts, but in fragments, aphorisms and poems, which are\noften more elusive and suggestive than conclusive.\n\n\nNevertheless, in spite of these challenges the task of characterizing\nromantic aesthetics is neither impossible nor undesirable, as numerous\nthinkers responding to Lovejoy’s radical skepticism have noted.\nWhile warning against a reductive definition of romanticism, Berlin,\nfor example, still heralded the need for a general\ncharacterization:\n\n\n\n\n[Although] one does…have a certain sympathy with\nLovejoy’s despair…[he is] in this instance mistaken.\nThere was a romantic movement; it did have something which\nwas central to it; it did create a great revolution in consciousness,\nand it is important to discover what it is. (1999: 20) \n\n\n\nRecent attempts to characterize romanticism and to stress its\ncontemporary relevance follow this path. Instead of overlooking the\nundeniable differences between the variety of romanticisms of\ndifferent nations that Lovejoy had stressed, such studies attempt to\ncharacterize romanticism, not in terms of a single definition, a\nspecific time, or a specific place, but in terms of “particular\nphilosophical questions and concerns” (Nassar 2014b: 10,\nn.9).\n\n\nThis entry approaches the topic along similar lines in order to\nidentify a cluster of related questions, concerns, themes, and\napproaches that are characteristics of the aesthetics of various\nromanticisms, and in order to bring out what is “romantic”\nin them. In lieu of a chronological, geographical, national, or\nfigure-based organization, the following is structured\nthematically—it focuses on the central romantic commitment to\nthe primacy of aesthetics (introduced in\n §1),\n and offers different philosophical explanations of this primacy (in\nthe remaining sections).\n\n\nWhile the German, British and French romantics are all considered, the\ncentral protagonists in the following are the German romantics. Two\nreasons explain this focus: first, because it has paved the way for\nthe other romanticisms, German romanticism has a pride of place among\nthe different national romanticisms (cf. Lovejoy 1960 and Berlin\n1999). Second, the aesthetic outlook that was developed in Germany\nroughly between 1796 and 1801–02—the period that\ncorresponds to the heyday of what is known as “Early\nRomanticism”\n [Frühromantik][1]—offers\n the most philosophical expression of romanticism since it is\ngrounded primarily in the epistemological, metaphysical, ethical, and\npolitical concerns that the German romantics discerned in the\naftermath of Kant’s\n philosophy.[2]\n The entry elaborates on these concerns and explains how they shed\nlight on the romantic understanding of beauty and art as fundamental\nin human life.\n\nOne common concern strikingly unifies otherwise different romantic\ncontributions. Early and late, German, British and French, the\nromantics advocated what may legitimately be called “the primacy\nof the aesthetic”. In romanticism, the\n“aesthetic”—most broadly that which concerns beauty\nand art—is not just one aspect of human life or one branch of\nthe humanistic studies. Rather, if the romantic ideal is to\nmaterialize, aesthetics should permeate and shape human life.\nFriedrich Schlegel, one of the leading figures in Early German\nRomanticism, put this idea in a few memorable phrases: “The\nRomantic imperative demands [that] all nature and science should\nbecome art [and] art should become nature and science” (FLP:\n#586); “poetry and philosophy should be united” (CF:\n#115), and “life and society [should be made] poetic” (AF:\n#16). \nSchlegel is not alone on this matter. Similar sentiments and slogans\nhad been expressed just a little earlier in what is commonly regarded\nas the manifesto of German romanticism, The Oldest Programme:\n \nThe idea that unites everyone [is] the idea of\nbeauty…I am now convinced that the highest act of\nreason, by encompassing all ideas, is an aesthetic act, and that\ntruth and goodness are siblings only in beauty.\n(Hölderlin, in Bernstein 2003:  186).[3] \nThe British romantics have taken up and developed this view that the\naesthetic is the foundation of knowledge and the pursuit of truth.\n“‘Beauty is truth, truth beauty,’—that is\nall//Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know”, Keats famously\ndeclared in the Ode on a Grecian Urn ([1820] lines 49–50,\nPJK). And in the Preface to Coleridge and Wordsworth's Lyrical\nBallads (1800), we read, “Poetry is the first and last of\nall knowledge—it is as immortal as the heart of man”\n(paragraph 20, in PWWW, I, p. 141). \nHow is this core feature of romantic aesthetics, the primacy of the\naesthetic, to be explained? \nA textually grounded and philosophically viable way to approach the\nimperative is as a structural or formal demand. On that reading, the\nimperative requires that we model our epistemological,\nmetaphysical, ethical, political, social and scientific pursuits\naccording to the form of the aesthetic comportment to the world,\nexemplified in poetry. On such an approach, rather than aiming to\nreplace “real” life, science and philosophy with\npoetry, the romantics urge human beings to fashion their ordinary\nlives and to do science and philosophy according to the model provided\nby poetry. Philosophy, science and everyday life need not be\npoetry, but poetic or poetry-like.\nStructurally, they should become similar. Why so? The main\ntask of this entry is to offer an answer to this question and to show\nthat the reasons for “poeticizing” life, science and\nphilosophy are philosophical. \nFor over a century, romanticism has standardly been regarded as a\nreaction against the Enlightenment (e.g., Haym 1870). The primacy of\naesthetics may seem to speak in favor of this story because, on this\ninterpretation, the romantics replaced the Enlightenment’s faith\nin the sovereignty of reason with a belief in the sovereignty of art\nand the affective and imaginative capacities that are involved in\naesthetic experience. On this traditional interpretation, romanticism\nis antirationalist or irrationalist. But, while the romantic pursuit\nof the primacy of aesthetics marks a break with the Enlightenment,\nregarding romantic aesthetics as antirational or irrational and as\nantagonistic to the core Enlightenment values is unjustified for a\nhost of reasons (cf. Beiser 2003, Engell 1981, Gregory 2005). \nFirst, the romantics’ focus on and praise for rational and\nautonomous criticism is continuous with the Enlightenment’s\ncommitment to the value of rational criticism. Admiring Goetthold\nEphraim Lessing’s ideal of criticism and his devotion to\nindependent thinking, Friedrich Schlegel writes, “critique is\nthe common pillar on which the entire edifice of knowledge and\nlanguage rests” (Critique: 271). Rather than discontinuing the\nEnlightenment’s call to submit every belief and every action to\nthe authority of rational criticism, the romantics are responsible for\ncontinuing “the age of criticism”—which is usually\ntaken to characterize the eighteenth century—well into the\nnineteenth century. In that sense, they are the “children”\nof the Enlightenment. \nSecond, many of the core features of romantic aesthetics in addition\nto criticism—like the relation between beauty, truth and\ngoodness, the pursuit of unity among variety and the significance of\nthe imagination and the sublime—would have been impossible\nindependently of key Enlightenment thinkers. \nThird, the romantic elevation of aesthetic feeling and the creative\nimagination did not come at the price of their faith in and respect\nfor reason. Even Friedrich Schlegel, who is often considered to be the\nmost enthusiastically inclined romantic, opened his Lectures on\nTranscendental Philosophy by arguing that philosophy is “a\nstriving towards a knowledge…of the whole person” (ITP:\n241). In one of his fragments, he commanded: “Never tire of\ncultivating the intellect until you will have finally found what is\noriginal and essential” (Ideas: #124). And yet in\nanother fragment, he claimed that one of the two centers of genuine\nphilosophy is “the rule of reason” (Ideas:\n#117). \nSuch proclamations challenge the alleged break between the\nEnlightenment and romanticism as much as they challenge another\nstandard interpretation of romanticism, one that takes it to be a\ndirect outgrowth of Sturm und Drang, a counter-Enlightenment\nmovement that flourished in the 1760s and 1770s. Briefly, this\nresponse to the Enlightenment, expressed in works of literature,\ntheatre, music and the plastic arts, heralded individual subjectivity\nand the free expression of unconstrained feelings as the proper\nreplacements for the values of the Enlightenment. \nNo doubt, the romantics shared with this movement the belief in a call\n“back to feeling”. But regarding romanticism as simply a\ncontinuation of Sturm und Drang finds no grounding in\nromantic texts. In his review of Friedrich Jacobi, one of the main\nsources of influence on Sturm und Drang, Schlegel declared,\n“Only when striving toward truth and knowledge\ncan a spirit be called a philosophical spirit” (Review of\nJacobi’s Woldamer, KA II: 71–2). In the same review,\nSchlegel harshly criticized what is known as Jacobi’s salto\nmortale or “leap of faith”: this is Jacobi’s\nview that the only way to salvage our ethical and religious beliefs,\nin the face of the limitations of the Enlightenment, is to renounce\nreason in favor of mere sensation and faith. In contrast to\nJacobi, the German romantics never attempted to replace\nreason with faith, sensation, unconstrained feeling or intuition.\nInstead, they wished to bring out the rationality of the passions and\nthe passionate nature of reason as part of a unified and balanced\npicture of human life. Rather than a straight development of Sturm\nund Drang, then, romanticism is better understood as an attempt\nto synthesize the grain of truth in the movement with the grain of\ntruth in the philosophy of Enlightenment, or simply put, to synthesize\nreason and sensibility. \nSimilarly, the British and French romantics did not mean to dismiss\nreason and replace it with passion and imagination, but strived after\n“a conjunction of reason and passion” (Wordsworth,\n“Essays on Epitaphs 1810” in PWWW). Accordingly, what\nColeridge, for example, admired in Wordsworth was not imagination and\nfeeling alone, but  \nthe union of deep feeling with profound thought; the fine balance of\ntruth in observing with the imaginative faculty in modifying the\nobjects observed. (Coleridge, BL: Ch. 4) \nThe romantics, then, sought to supplement but not to supplant\nreason with the receptive capacities of the mind, primarily with the\ncapacities involved in aesthetic apprehension and artistic production.\nThey extended Kant’s renowned view of concepts and intuitions,\nsuggesting that reason without feeling is empty and feeling\nwithout reason is blind. Without the former, human beings would\nbe reduced to mere animality; without the latter they would lose their\nhumanity: \nWe cannot deny the drive to free ourselves, to ennoble ourselves, to\nprogress into the infinite. That would be animalistic. But we can also\nnot deny the drive to be determined, to be receptive; that would not\nbe human. (Hölderlin, Hyperion, HSA 3:194) \nFor the romantics, our receptive and spontaneous capacities could only\nbe abstracted in thought, but not separated in reality: “Action\nand passion are inseparable as north and south” (Novalis, FS:\n#317). Human dignity is grounded in rational and normatively\nconstrained receptivity just as much as it is grounded in spontaneity.\n \nThe restless striving after activity, the highest criterion of\njudgment, does not exclude all the virtues of receptivity but can\nonly exist with them. (F. Schlegel, KA 12: 130) \nRather than dismissing the role and the significance of reason as\nsuch, the romantics challenged merely certain uses of reason—for\nexample, dogmatic uses of reason, the laying down of absolute\nfoundations, and system-building. And in a Kantian manner, they were\nconcerned to expose the limits of reason and constrain its uses to\nlegitimate boundaries. But even the romantic exposure of limits is, as\nit were, “aesthetic”. “Aesthetic?” one may\nask. Yes, aesthetic in the sense that some of the romantic central\ndevices for exposing the limits of reason are (originally)\n“aesthetic”, “artistic” or\n“literary”. “Romantic Poetry” is one such\ndevice and “Irony” is another. \n“Romantic Poetry” is a notion that Friedrich Schlegel\ncoined and described in most detail in Athenaeum Fragments\n(AF) number 116. Rather than a particular genre or kind of poetry,\nRomantic Poetry is poetry as such insofar as “all poetry is or\nshould be romantic” (Schlegel, AF: #116). Romantic Poetry brings\nout the limits of reason in virtue of being reflective,\n“[hovering] on the wings of poetic reflection, and [capable of\nraising] that reflection again and again to a higher power” (AF:\n#116). Rather than being merely the “portrayed” object\nitself—a poetic representation—it “hover[s] at the\nmidpoint between the portrayed and the portrayer” (AF: #116),\nand so, like Kant’s transcendental philosophy, reflects on the\nconditions of its own possibility and of human mindedness itself. It\nis not surprising, then, that Romantic Poetry is called\n“transcendental” poetry: “a poetry and a poetry of\npoetry” (AF: #238). Goethe’s Wilhelm Meister, a\nromantic favorite, manifests this dual reflective and substantive\nnature:  \nIt was so much the poet’s intentions to set up a comprehensive\ntheory of art or rather to represent one in living examples and\naspects.…This might suggest that the novel is as much an\nhistorical philosophy of art as a true work of art, and that\neverything which the poet so lovingly presents as his true aim and end\nis ultimately only means. But that is not so: it is all poetry, high,\npure poetry. (F. Schlegel, WM: 274) \nThe transcendental nature of romantic poetry suggests that it does not\ntranscend merely the boundaries of a particular genre, but even the\nboundaries of the literary as such. Romantic Poetry is poetry as much\nas it is a philosophical method and a vital approach to human life. It\nis a creative and reflective human power, manifested in the\ntheoretical, practical and aesthetic aspects of life:  \ntranscendental poetry…really embraces all transcendental\nfunctions…. The transcendental poet is the transcendental\nperson altogether. (Novalis, Logological Fragments: #41) \nRomantic poetry is not alone in exposing the conditions of finite\nexistence, but accompanied by an ironic way of living. Irony is a mode\nof self-restriction, whose “value and dignity” as\na crucial dimension of human life, must be recognized (F. Schlegel,\nCF: #28). Irony is the balance between “self-creation and\nself-destruction” (CF: #28), which means that irony is\ncreative—it is constructive of its own perspective on the world.\nBut at the same time, it is also “destructive” of the\npretensions implicit in any perspective—the pretention to be\nholistic. Irony thus presents its perspective as restricted—as\nonly one among many different perspectives on the unconditioned whole.\nAccordingly, what romantic irony insists on through its restricting\nfunction is (a) the conceptual inaccessibility of the\n“Absolute” (explained in\n §3),\n and (b) what is known as “perspectivism”—the view\nthat human beings are capable only of finite and limited perspective\non the universe as a whole. Being ironic is a way of consciously and\nintentionally bringing out the fragmentary nature of the human\nsituation as lacking a “view from nowhere”. \nLike Romantic Poetry, irony is not merely a literary or even a\nrhetorical device. Nor is it a purely theoretical method. Rather, in a\nSocratic spirit, romantic irony is a way of life. For it is,  \nafter all, for the artist as well as the man, the first and the last,\nthe most necessary and the highest duty…most necessary because\nwherever one does not restrict oneself, one is restricted by the\nworld; and that makes one a slave. (CF: #37)  \nEveryone, then, not only the writer, should be ironic. For, as\nexposing our finitude, irony is not only another romantic analogue of\nKant’s transcendental method—the antidote to\nreason’s natural but spurious tendency to transcend its\nlimits—but also an existential condition of humility (On irony\nsee also CF: #26, #42, #48, 108; AF: 51, 121; and On\nIncomprehensibility). \nThe romantic use of irony was sharply criticized, most famously by\nHegel, as free floating form of subjectivity. But not only does this\ncriticism fail to do justice to the romantic insistence that irony\nitself is a form of self-constraint, but also to the imperative:\n“Don’t exaggerate self-restriction” (F. Schlegel,\nCF: #37). This demand to constrain and regulate self-restriction\nitself is of equal importance to the demand to practice irony. Rather\nthan a free floating form of subjectivity, then, romantic irony is a\nconstrained, and normatively governed form of life, meant to expose\nthe limits of reason and facilitate a life of humility (cf. Rush 2006:\n187). Romantic irony is a commitment to the form of life that is\ngoverned by the acknowledgement of finitude; a\n“transcendentally-Socratic” life of humility. \nAccordingly, rather than an irrational or an anti-Enlightenment\nstance, romantic aesthetics is marked by a respect for and devotion to\nreason and rationality “within their bounds”. \nEven a cursory glance through the writings of the romantics assures\nthe reader that their interest in art and aesthetics is closely tied\nto their epistemological and metaphysical concerns. The primacy that\nthe romantics attributed to aesthetics is explained by (but is not\nreduced to) the roles that art and beauty may play in the pursuits of\nepistemic and metaphysical goals. One such goal concerns what the\nGerman romantics, and following them, Coleridge, called the\n“Absolute” [das Absolute]. \nBriefly, this is how this explanation goes: in the aftermath of\nKant’s philosophy, the romantics were concerned with the\nAbsolute, understood as the unconditioned totality of all conditions.\nLike Kant, they believed that such an unconditioned totality is\ninaccessible to discursive reason and is, to that extent,\nunknowable to human beings. But reason’s natural drive towards\nthis “Absolute” is nonetheless significant and valuable\n (§3.1).\n In aesthetics they found a mode of life that best approximates (even\nif never reaches or grasps) the Absolute, insofar as the aesthetic\napproach to artworks (a) includes indeterminate affective aspect\n (§3.2),\n (b) involves a sui generis normativity, constituting its own\nnorms in attunement with the artwork it faces\n (§3.3),\n (c) is particularly suited to approach individual unities\n (§3.4),\n and (d) is open-ended\n (§3.5). \nMost broadly, by the “Absolute”, the romantics refer to\nthe unconditioned totality of all conditions. While the absolute\nitself is conditioned by nothing, it conditions all the finite\nphysical and mental manifestations of the world. Inspired by\nKant’s discussion of omnitudo\nrealitatis—“All of Reality”—and by\nSpinoza’s all encompassing “substance”, the romantic\nAbsolute is a whole, rather than an aggregate, that encompasses\neverything else, physical and mental: “Only the whole is\nabsolute” (Novalis, AB: #454); “The universe is the\nabsolute subject, or the totality of all predicates” (AB: #633).\nMetaphysically, every finite thing is merely one manifestation of an\nunconditional totality: only a single perspective on the whole. It is\nthus ultimately finite but also infinite, as part and parcel of the\ninfinite whole. \nThis notion of the Absolute is not distinctively romantic. The German\nIdealists, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, were also concerned with\nrelated conceptions of the Absolute. But the romantic treatment of the\nAbsolute is distinctively different from the idealistic one. And it is\nthe distinctive romantic treatment of the Absolute that\nexplains much in romantic aesthetics: While the idealists took the\nAbsolute to be transparent to the human mind, conceptually\nrepresentable, and inferentially related to other items of knowledge,\nthe romantics regarded it as (1) ungraspable by concepts (i.e., as\n“non-discursive”) and (2) as non-foundational. \nFollowing Kant, the romantics believed that all knowledge is\ndiscursive: knowing requires conceptualization. But since concepts\ncondition everything that might be known by determining it to be one\nway or another according to the forms of discursive thought, the\nAbsolute, by its very definition as unconditioned, cannot be known.\n \nKnowledge [Erkennen] already denotes conditioned knowledge.\nThe unknowability of the absolute is, therefore, an identical\ntriviality. (F. Schlegel, KA 18: 511, #64) \nThe romantics further argued that the attempt to ground the whole\nedifice of knowledge in the Absolute—familiar to them from\nFichte’s project, which they both admired and harshly\ncriticized—is futile. Like Kant, they believed that\nreason’s natural and necessary drive to proceed towards the\nunconditioned can never be fully realized. The unconditioned totality\nof experience is “a regulative idea” (Novalis,\nFS: #472): it cannot serve as a systematic grounding of experience. As\nNovalis memorably puts it:  \nWe seek the unconditioned [Das Ubedingte] and always find\nonly [conditioned] things [Dinge].\n(Blüthenstaub, NS 2: 413, #1) \nSkeptical as they were about the discursive accessibility of the\nAbsolute and about its capacity to ground all knowledge, the romantics\nnever questioned either its existence or the worth of (open-endedly)\nstriving after it: \nNeither our knowledge nor our action can ever attain the point at\nwhich…. All is one; the determinate line can be united with the\nindeterminate only through an infinite approximation [in\nunendlicher Annäherung] (Hölderlin, “Hyperion”, HSA 3:\n326). \nTherefore, philosophy, whose first theorem is “All is One and\nOne is All” (F. Schlegel, ITP: 244), must be “a\nstriving” (ITP: 244). Even though philosophy cannot\nsystematically deduce all knowledge from the Absolute, it must\nnonetheless pursue its approximation. But if not through concepts, how\ncan one approximate the Absolute? \nThis is where aesthetics comes into the picture. Although scholars of\nromanticism disagree about the exact nature of the romantic\napproximation of the\n Absolute,[4]\n they widely agree that it includes a variety of feelings associated\nwith the aesthetic, like aesthetic pleasure, poetic feeling,\n“longing for the infinite [Sehnsucht nach dem\nUnendlichen]” and “love”, and that it depends\non the deployment of critical notions like “romantic\npoetry”, wit, irony, allegory, myth and the creative\nimagination: \nIf we abstract from all knowledge and will…we still find\nsomething more, that is feeling and striving. We\nwant to see if we will perhaps find something here that is analogous\nto the consciousness of the infinite…. (F. Schlegel, ITP:\n244–45). \nPoetry elevates each single thing through a particular combination\nwith the rest of the whole, [by allowing] the individual [to] live in\nthe whole and the whole in the individual. (Novalis,\nPoësie, NS 2: 533, #31). \nThe romantics believed that these aesthetic and affective attitudes\nmake it impossible for us to deny that there is something “which\nis not I, nor comes from the I, and which is also not merely a\nNon-I” (F. Schlegel, Thoughts, KA 18: #83). Baudelaire\nsummarizes these romantic sentiments, declaring,  \nThe one who says romanticism says modern art—which is to say\nintimacy, spirituality, color, aspiration towards the\ninfinite—expressed by all the resources of art. (Salon of\n1846 [1981]) \nWhat is it about the aesthetic engagement with art and beauty that is\nparticularly suitable for approximating the Absolute? The rest of this\nsection will develop a few possible answers to this question. \nIn the introduction to the Critique of the Power of Judgment,\nKant writes that the feeling of pleasure in general, and aesthetic\npleasure in particular, is the only representation that can never\n“become an element of cognition at all” (AK 5: 189). \nOne might think that feelings are thus placed outside of rationality.\nBut this would be a mistake. On Kant’s picture, aesthetic\nfeeling is rational insofar as it is grounded in a universal mental\nstate that underlies our capacity to judge in general (the free play\nof the imagination and the understanding), and insofar as it is,\nthrough this mental state, responsive to the claims that beautiful\nobjects make on everyone’s satisfaction (AK 5: 282).\nRationality, then, is irreducible to cognition both in the Kantian\nframework and in its romantic inheritance. Aesthetic feeling is\nrational because of its ground and responsiveness to a claim, but\nnon-cognitive insofar as it cannot be subsumed under concepts. Feeling\ndoes not determine any concrete property that its object has\nindependently of subjectivity (as cognition would), but is rather\nresponsive to a relation between a subject and an object. Aesthetic\npleasure, particularly, is a non-determining mode of reflecting on the\nrelation, not between a particular subject and a particular object,\nbut between subjectivity and objectivity as such. \nThis rational but non-cognitive nature of feeling, in general, and of\naesthetic feeling, in particular, is perhaps the central feature that\nrenders aesthetic feeling an attractive ingredient in addressing the\nepistemic and metaphysical concerns that occupied the romantics. For\nwhile all cognition is determination through concepts, Kant’s\naesthetics suggests a mode of reflective awareness that is not\ndetermining, but yet a way of being aware of and responsive to aspects\nof the world. This is exactly what the romantics have been looking\nfor—a non-discursive, but rational and normatively governed mode\nof awareness. And they found it in poetry, regarding it as grounded in\nfeeling: \nNot art and artworks make the artist, but feeling and inspiration and\nimpulse. (F. Schlegel, CF: #63) \nPoetry is passion. (Wordsworth, “Note to the Thorn” in LB:\n 136) \nAll good poetry [originates in] the spontaneous overflow of powerful\nfeelings. (Wordsworth, Preface to Lyrical Ballads (1800), paragraph\n26, in LB) \nIf, then, feelings and passions are constitutive of art, and if\naesthetic or poetic feeling is a key ingredient in the pursuit of the\nAbsolute, then philosophy should become poetic and “poetry and\nphilosophy should be made unified” (F. Schlegel, CF: #115). We\nare now in a position to appreciate that this romantic imperative is\nexplained partly by the view that philosophy cannot be reduced to\nconcepts and propositions, but must also include certain kinds of\naffective mental states. To paraphrase Wittgenstein, discursive\nreasoning comes to an end.  \nThe non-determining character of aesthetic feeling is related to the\ndistinctive kind of normativity that characterizes artistic production\nand aesthetic appreciation. An expression borrowed from Kant is\nfitting here: on the romantic picture, both artistic production and\naesthetic appreciation are “lawful without a law”. Both\nare the source of their own normativity, without being subject to any\nexternal law. Given that, they are appropriate for approximating the\nAbsolute insofar as this approximation must be non-determining\n(applying no conditions), but normatively governed rather than\narbitrary. \nFollowing Kant’s account of the genius, the romantics developed\nan understanding of the artist as, on the one hand, original and\nimaginative (rather than submitting to any law of nature or principle\nborrowed from the tradition of art), and, on the other hand, receptive\nto nature: “Every good poem must be wholly intentional and\nwholly instinctive” (F. Schlegel, CF: #23). This combination of\nbeing independent of given rules and attuned to\nsomething other than yourself is required not only for the genius, but\nalso for approximating the Absolute. And it is this requirement that\nexplains “the categorical imperative of genius[:] You should\ndemand genius from everyone” (F. Schlegel, CF: #16). If everyone\nis to approximate the Absolute, then everyone should model herself\nafter the genius. \nCriticism consists of a related combination of features. While it is\nbased on no prior rules, it is also open and receptive to the work it\nconcerns. And it is through the engagement with the work that each\ncritical judgment constitutes its own norms. Although we can and\nshould legitimize our judgments of beauty and art, we cannot do so by\nappeal to any given concepts or norms that are external to the work at\nstake. The artwork, on this picture, is sui generis—it\nprovides its own standards of appreciation: “Poetry is a\nrepublican speech: a speech which is its own law and end unto\nitself” (F. Schlegel, CF: #65). The critic should seek to\nexpress the work in a way that is faithful to its individual nature\nand be responsive to the specific norms that it constitutes: \nTo judge [Goethe’s Wilhelm Meister] according to an\nidea of genre drawn from custom and belief, accidental experiences and\narbitrary demands is as if a child tried to clutch the stars and the\nmoon in his hand and pack them in his satchel…. Fortunately,\n[the novel] turns out to be one of those books, which carries its own\njudgment within it. (F. Schlegel, WM: 275) \nThat means that beauty makes demands on us, demands that, according to\nthe romantics, are analogous to the demands that other persons make on\nus. Beautiful objects make a claim on us to respond to them as the\nspecific individuals that they are, on their own terms: “See\nyour statues, your paintings, your friends as they are”\n(Diderot, Salon of 1767). Hence, the romantic declaration,\n“one cannot really speak of poetry except in the language of\npoetry” (F. Schlegel, DP).  \nThis lawfulness without a law fits the requirements of the Absolute.\nFor, if we adopt this structure of normativity and expression in our\npursuit of the Absolute, we may approach it in a normatively governed\nand committed way, without determining and thus conditioning it\naccording to any given law, principle, or concept. Here, then, is\nanother reason why philosophy should become poetic, and the true\nphilosopher, not merely a “half critic” (as the romantics\nalleged against Kant), but a complete critic: philosophy should be\nopen and attuned to the Absolute without trying to subsume it under\nany principle of reason, just as criticism is open and attuned to each\nwork without subsuming it under any external\n law.[5] \nLike Spinoza’s God and Kant’s omnitudo realitatis\n(All of Reality), the Absolute is an all-encompassing\nindividual: while it comprehends everything else, the\nAbsolute is also concrete. It is an individual whole—a totality,\nthe parts of which could be understood only negatively, as its\nlimitations. To approximate the Absolute, then, we need a mode of\nconsciousness that is particularly suited to discern a holistic unity\nin an individual. While\n §5.3\n discusses what is required in order to apprehend holistic unities,\nand the holistic unities of artworks and natural beauties, this\nsection focuses on the individual character of artworks and natural\nbeauties. \nOn the romantic picture, an artwork that does not present itself as a\n“living individual” (Novalis, Poësie, NS 2:\n534, #35) is not worthy of the title of a work of art, and the one who\ndoes not approach artworks as unique individuals is not a genuine\naesthetic critic: “Whoever conceives of poetry or philosophy as\nindividuals has a feeling for them” (F. Schlegel, AF: #415). The\naesthetic approach to beauty, then, is an approach to those things\nthat are irreducibly individuals, those that should not be approached\nmerely as ones of many—as instances of general kinds—but\nas concrete individuals: “Everything that is to be criticized\nmust be an individual” (F. Schlegel, FLP: #634).And\nthis is the very approach that is required in the pursuit of the\nAbsolute given its individual nature. \nKant attributes to aesthetic pleasure: \na causality in itself, namely that of maintaining the state of the\nrepresentation of the mind and the occupation of the cognitive powers\nwithout a further aim. We linger over the consideration of the\nbeautiful because this consideration strengthens and reproduces\nitself. (AK 5: 222) \nAesthetic feeling is open-ended and future-oriented. In contrast to\npractical pleasures (the “pleasure in the good”) and to\nprivate, sensory pleasures (the “pleasure in the\nagreeable”) that need to bring forth an action or an object in\norder to maintain themselves, aesthetic pleasure is self-maintaining.\nThis is partly because aesthetically enjoying an object involves a\ncommitment to remain faithful to the beauty of that object, beauty\nthat calls for and deserves an open-ended affective pursuit. The\nromantics welcomed this structure of aesthetic feeling as particularly\nsuitable for the pursuit of the Absolute. Since the Absolute can never\nbe determined, the stance that approximates it must itself be\nopen-ended. It should involve a commitment to keep striving after the\nAbsolute open-endedly. \nSince the romantics take philosophy to be a tendency “towards\nthe Absolute” (Schlegel, ITP: 242), philosophy itself should be\nreconceived. The systematic search after first principles is not only\nhopeless, but also unfortunate. It can only slight the significance of\nthe Absolute by the effort to determine it through principles.\nInstead, philosophy should be aesthetically shaped, as an open-ended\npursuit: \nIf knowledge of the infinite is itself infinite, therefore always only\nincomplete, imperfect, then philosophy as a science can never be\ncompleted closed and perfect, it can always only strive for these high\ngoals, and try all possible ways to come closer and closer to them.\n(Schlegel, Lectures on Transcendental Philosophy, KA 12:\n166) \nThe intersection between romantic aesthetics, ethics and politics\noffers a particularly clear challenge to the standard view of the\nromantics as anti-Enlightenment (discussed in\n §2).\n This is because the romantics turned to aesthetics to a large extent\nin order to pursue, rather than to reject, some of the core ethical\nand political values of the Enlightenment, such as autonomy or\nself-determination and the ideal of Bildung. Art and\naesthetics also provided a model for the romantic political ideal: a\ndemocratic, egalitarian community grounded in the republican values of\nliberty, equality and fraternity. \nIn addition to proving the anti-Enlightenment interpretation of the\nromantics false, tracing these romantic notions of autonomy,\nBildung and political community also offers a challenge to\nanother well-known interpretation of the movement as apolitical (see\nSchmitt 1986). In contrast to this interpretation, we find the\nromantics exploring and emphasizing the importance of aesthetics for\nethical and political concerns. Shelley, for example, wrote in a\nletter to a friend: “I consider Poetry subordinate to moral\n& political science” (Shelley, LS 2: 71). In his famous\nDefence of Poetry (1821), he proclaimed, “Poets are the\nunacknowledged legislators of the world” (SPP). Rather than\n“aestheticizing” politics, then, the romantics found in\nart and aesthetics resources for solving ethical and political\nproblems. \nYet, a central difficulty facing any interpretation of romantic ethics\nand politics lies in the change that this view has undergone during\nthe later years of many a romantic: the strong democratic and\negalitarian views of the likes of Friedrich Schlegel and Friedrich\nSchleiermacher gave way to a growing conservatism and religiosity\nafter 1800. The first generation of British romantics likewise turned\nfrom their conviction that to be young during the revolution was, as\nWordsworth said, “bliss” and “heaven”, to an\nacknowledgement of the challenges awaiting a genuine political reform.\nWith this shift in mind, they turned from political optimism to\nreligion. A unified account of romantic politics is thus untenable.\nInstead, the section will focus on the political views of the German\nromantics during their “formative years” (from\n1797–1800) and of the British romantics mainly during their\nearly and middle phases This is because the ideals developed during\nthese phases, though different from some of the later ideals, can shed\nlight on the romantic path towards conservatism later on (Beiser\n1992).\n §4.5\n will briefly present the romantics’ later political\nthought. \n“Freedom is the only reality in wishing, willing, sensing and\nstriving”, writes F. Schlegel (TPL II: 155). While the absolute\nreality of freedom might not admit of a proof, according to many of\nthe romantics, human beings should nonetheless approximate freedom by\ndeveloping autonomy—self-determination and self-legislation.\nAutonomy is the right of the individual to think for herself and act\nrationally and freely (TPL II: 155). The work of art and aesthetic\njudgment were seen as paradigmatic expressions of autonomy and, as\nsuch, as splendid models for the cultivation of individual human\nautonomy. For (as discussed in\n §3.3)\n neither the creation of art nor its appreciation is grounded in prior\ngiven laws. And yet, both the production and judgment of art are not\nlawless, but normatively governed by the laws generated autonomously\nby each individual work and by each individual aesthetic judgment.\nPoetry is a “law unto itself”. \nThis characteristic of the production and judgment of art should not\nonly be incorporated into the way every person is to govern\nherself—as the source of her own rational laws rather than as\nsubject to external laws, and as self-determining rather than\npassively determined—but also serve as a model for the way in\nwhich every person should be respected and treated. Aesthetics\nprovides us with a paradigm for following two central ethical\ndemands—the demand to govern oneself autonomously and the demand\nto respect everyone else as autonomous. \nThese two duties, then, constitute another explanation of the\n“categorical imperative of the genius” previously\nmentioned—the demand that every person be a genius. For if every\nindividual is to be autonomous, she should fashion herself after the\nmodel of the artist. \nBildung is another characteristic romantic value that each\nindividual should develop in herself. While literally meaning\n“formation”, Bildung is best understood as a mode\nof ethical and cultural cultivation, or self-realization that allows\nthe individual to mature into independence and responsibility.\n“Concerning Bildung, we speak not of external culture,\nbut the development of independence” (F. Schlegel, TPL\nII: 148). Bildung is a particularly modern value,\nformed at least in part as a challenge to what the romantics regarded\nas the rift between sensibility and reason in modern life. To achieve\nBildung, each individual has to constitute herself as a\nunified whole that coordinates a balance between sensibility and\nreason: “The end of humanity is…to achieve harmony in\nknowing, doing and enjoying” (F. Schlegel, On the Study of\nGreek Poetry, in KA I, 627). \nThe artwork is a good model for such an ideal insofar as it is,\naccording to the romantics, an organic and harmonious whole of diverse\nand even conflicting parts: \nPoetry…must be a harmonious mood of our mind…where\neverything finds its proper aspect…. Everything in a truly\npoetic book seems so natural—and yet so marvelous. We\nthink it could not be otherwise…and we feel the\ninfinite…sensations of a plurality in agreement. (Novalis, Last\nFragments: #3) \nThis is why “Every human being who is cultivated and who\ncultivates himself”, namely, the person who achieves\nBildung, “contains a novel within himself” (F.\nSchlegel, AF: #78). \nAesthetic judgment is also a harmony of reason and sensibility. On\nthis issue too, the romantics were inspired by Kant’s\naesthetics, according to which aesthetic judgment consists in the free\nplay between the understanding, imagination and pleasure. Approaching\nthe world, ourselves and one another aesthetically, then, is\napproaching it with a harmony of “knowing, doing, and\nenjoying”. And achieving this harmony constitutes a genuine\nmoral being: a balanced rational, sensible and affective person. For\nthat reason, it is not surprising to find Coleridge, the critic,\naiming to establish “the close and reciprocal connections of\nJust Taste with pure Morality” (Lecture I, CLL). \nRomantic Bildung was a political ideal as much as it was an\nethical one. It was needed, not only for the sake of independent\nindividual responsibility, but also for the possibility of a genuine\nnon-revolutionary republic: \nThere is no greater need of the age than the need for a spiritual\ncounterweight to the Revolution and to the despotism which the\nRevolution exercises over people…. Where can we seek and find\nsuch a counterweight? The answer isn’t hard: unquestionably in\nourselves…the center of humanity lies there. (F. Schlegel,\nIdeas: #41) \nThe French revolution had shown the romantics both the value of a\nrepublic based on liberty, equality and fraternity, but also the\ndangers of anarchism and strife that revolutions carry with them. The\nproper path to a republic, they thought, is not through a\nrevolutionary act, but through proper education. Art does not only\noffer a model for a harmonious, cultivated soul, but is also the best\nmedium through which to achieve the moral education that\nleads to this harmony and, on its basis, to the best republic.\nAttending to art (as well as producing it) is a form of\nself-cultivation because the spirit of art allows human beings to\ntranscend baseness (a particular danger given modern instrumentalism\nand materialism), and to develop their humanity.  \nAs we now turn to see, the romantics regarded art also as a\nparticularly effective medium for uniting people, no matter their\ndifferences, and so took it to be a great spur for united, social and\npolitical action. \nThe allegiance to autonomy and to the value of Bildung may\nseem to indicate individualism. And it does, to an extent.\nWhile individuality is indeed a romantic value, anti-communal\nindividualism is not. The romantics never celebrated uncurbed\nindividuality, but called for a balance between individuality and\nsociality: “A certain regulated interaction between\nindividuality and universality…constitutes the first condition\nfor moral well-being” (F. Schlegel, OP: 427).  \nWithout doubt, the romantics criticized Kant’s categorical\nimperative as proposing a problematically universalistic ethics that\ndiscourages the free expression of unique personalities. They viewed\nsuch a universalist ethics as problematic because they regarded\nindividual expression and the development of a unique, characteristic\nand unified self as intrinsically and morally valuable. Yet, the\nromantics were also critical of extreme individualism, such as the one\nthey found promoted by some Enlightenment thinkers. In other words,\nthey challenged those individualists who criticized any form of social\nand communal participation as potentially a form of passive submission\nto external authority. \nIn response to these two extremes of universalism and radical\nindividualism, the romantics sought after a golden mean—romantic\nethics strived to preserve and strengthen social bonds and encouraged\na pluralistic communal life while supporting rational\ncriticism, autonomy, individual rights, liberties and freedom of\nexpression: “Does not the universal gain from the individual,\nthe individual from universal relations?” (Novalis, Faith and\nLove: #5). The romantics believed that individualism is not merely\ncompatible with sociality and communitarianism, but that it actually\ndepends on genuine forms of the latter: “The vocation of man is\nattainable only through human society” (F. Schlegel, TPL II:\n144). Autonomy and Bildung, in particular, though nothing\nother than individual freedom and self-realization, can never\nbe divorced from the social:  \nAutonomy should be universal and not relate to the individual but the\nwhole, for otherwise it would destroy itself…. We cannot\nconsider human beings individually. (TPL II: 156)  \nOn the romantic picture, the achievement of free, fully-formed\nindividuality is impossible independently of strong sociality and\nvice versa. An ideal of sociality is deficient if it leaves\nno freedom for the distinct expression and liberties of each\nindividual, and the individual is most herself, as an individual only\ninsofar as she freely interacts with others: “A person can be a\nperson only among people” (TPL II: 145). \nRather than contradictory impulses, as they are often regarded today,\nsociality and individuality, on the romantic picture, are not only\ncompatible but also naturally harmonious—grounded in human\nnature:[6] \nNo man is merely man, but…at the same time he can and should be\ngenuinely and truly all mankind. Therefore, man, in reaching out time\nand again beyond himself to seek and find the complement of his\ninnermost being in the depths of another, is certain to return to\nhimself. (F. Schlegel, DP: 54) \nIt is this romantic view of natural human\nsociability—rather than some exaggerated zeal or\neffusiveness—that explains and is explained by the centrality of\nlove in romanticism. In contrast to many a modern thinker, the\nromantics regarded love rather than self-interest as a basic condition\nof human nature (“Love is…the core of ourselves”\n(F. Schlegel, TPL II: 151)), and as the proper basis for a genuine\nsociable but pluralistic community: \nYes, love, you power of attraction of the spiritual world! No\nindividual life or development is possible without you. Without you\neverything must degenerate into a crude, homogeneous mass….\nThere is no individual development without love, and without the\ndevelopment of one’s individuality there is no perfection in\nlove. When one complements the other, both grow together inseparably.\nI feel united within me the two fundamental conditions of ethical\nlife! (Schleiermacher, ”Monologue II”, 180). \nBut as natural as it may be, the romantics believed that love has\nsuffered paralysis in modernity. On their view, the rise of capitalism\nand instrumentalism had suppressed natural social bonds and encouraged\nself-interest. The consequent view of human beings as solely\nquantitatively distinct further leveled them and inhibited their\ndistinctive and unique expressions. \nHow could people balance individuality and sociality in the face of\nmodernity? Here too romantic poetry and the creative imagination come\nto the rescue. Poetry is not only based in love, but is itself a form\nof love insofar as it bonds different individuals: \nPoetry befriends and binds with unseverable ties the hearts of all\nthose who love it. Even though in their own lives they may pursue the\nmost diverse ends, may feel contempt for what the other holds most\nsacred, may fail to appreciate or communicate with one another, and\nremain in all other realms strangers forever; in poetry through a\nhigher magic power, they are united and at peace. (F. Schlegel, DP:\n53) \nThe poet is, quintessentially, “a social being” (F.\nSchlegel, DP: 55) insofar as he both expresses, “in\nlasting works the expression of his unique poetry” (DP: 55)\nand reaches to others and reciprocally communicates with\nthem. The poet integrates:  \nhis part with the entire body of poetry…. He can do this when\nhe has found the center point through communication with those who\nhave found theirs from a different side, in a different way. Love\nneeds a responding love. Indeed, for the true poet’s\ncommunication…can be beneficial and instructive. (DP: 55) \nFollowing the “categorical imperative of the genius” is\nrequired, then, also for achieving Bildung and autonomous\nindividuality in and through society: it is an ethical and social\ndemand as well. \nWhile sociality and communal spirit are ethically required for the\nachievement of autonomy and Bildung, community was also a\nromantic political ideal. Such an ideal required that what\nthe romantics viewed as modern alienation—estrangement of the\nself from others—be challenged in three ways: by promoting love\n(as discussed above), developing a sphere of free social interaction\nand pursuing a holistic, social unity. \nThe ideal political community must facilitate a sphere of social life,\nwhich is free and independent of political control because free\nsociality and conversation, the ends of this sphere, are both valuable\nin themselves and the best alternative for external laws. The\nromantics believed that social bonds should not be upheld by laws that\nare imposed on individual citizens from outside, but by the love\nencouraged by a common culture and free interaction. Romantic poetry\nis an exemplary model for achieving such a free domain since it is\n“a republican speech…in which all the parts are free\ncitizens and have the right to vote” (Schlegel, CF: #65). \nAesthetics is at the center of this political vision also because the\npolitical ends of free sociability and conversation are the very same\nones that the romantics practiced in their intellectual-artistic\nsalons and in their communal, cooperative aesthetic projects. The\npolitical community should allow for creative and artistic endeavors\nsuch as the Athenaeum journal, which was the mouthpiece of\nthe German romantics at the end of the eighteenth century and a\njournal that was independent of the control of the publishing\nestablishment. It was written in collaboration (mainly by the Schlegel\nbrothers, Novalis, and Schleiermacher), and aimed at rational\ncriticism and Bildung. Such aesthetic projects are a model\nfor the politician. This is because “sympoetry” and\n“symphilosophy”, as Schlegel and Novalis called such\ncooperative intellectual and aesthetic projects, should be an integral\npart of political life: \nPerhaps a whole new epoch of science and art would be inaugurated were\nsymphilosophy and sympoetry to become so common and deeply felt that\nthere would be nothing odd were several people of mutually\ncomplementary natures to create works in communion with each other.\n(F. Schlegel, AF: #125) \nThe ideal political community must also be characterized by a specific\nkind of relation between the political body as a whole and its\nmembers: the state should be an organic or holistic whole, which means\nmost broadly that the state as a whole must be prior to the parts (see\nBeiser 1992). \nFirst, the best state is prior to its parts since, as we saw, it is\nnecessary for individual identity and self-realization. \nAdditionally, the romantic community as a whole is prior to the\nindividual citizens (i.e., its parts), insofar as genuine social bonds\nand a well-functioning political entity cannot be\n“constructed” out of separate self-sufficient and\nself-interested individuals (as the modern social contract theory has\nit). To properly function and achieve the ethical aim of sociality,\nthe links between the political members should be organic: the members\nshould not be connected to one another by an externally imposed social\ncontract, but by natural love, affection and attraction.\nUnsurprisingly, it is through poetry that the familial-like bonds,\nrequired for the ideal state, should be developed over and above the\nunit of the biological family. “Within the family, minds become\norganically one, and for this reason, the family is total\npoetry” (F. Schlegel, Ideas: #152). \nWhile the state as a whole should be prior to its parts in this\nsense, the law of such a state should not be imposed on its\ncitizens from outside, but be self-determined. Individual\nautonomy should be supported by promoting the direct and active\nparticipation of all individuals in the political process. The organic\nunity of the state, then, implies reciprocity: the parts are\ndependent on and are posterior to the whole, while the whole, in\nrespect of its essential self-determination, also depends on and is\nposterior to its parts. \nThe work of art provides, once again, the structural model for this\npolitical ideal by virtue of its organic unity, where “every\nwhole can be a part and every part really a whole” (Schlegel,\nCF: #14). When genuine, art is characterized exactly by the kind of\nholistic, organic, but egalitarian and pluralistic unity that must\ncharacterize the ideal community: \nMany works that are praised for the beauty of their coherence have\nless unity than a motley heap of ideas simply animated by the ghost of\na spirit and aiming at a single purpose. What really holds the latter\ntogether is that free and equal fellowship in which, so the wise man\nassures us, the citizens of the perfect state will live at some future\ndate; it’s that unqualifiedly social spirit…. (F.\nSchlegel, CF: #103) \nAn organic state is called for also because the mechanistic structure\nof the modern state is responsible for the decline of religion. This\nstructure caused, according to the romantics, a form of\n“enslavement” and a faith in materialism and\ninstrumentalism, both of which prevent people from cultivating their\nspirituality and relation to the divine. Both in their early and late\nphases, the romantics believed that poetry was the best way for\ninspiring spirituality and religiosity. “Every artist is a\nmediator for all other men”, writes F. Schlegel (Ideas:\n#44), regarding this “mediator” as mediating between man\nand God. Schleiermacher confirms and develops this connection when\nsuggesting that poets are: \nthe true priests of the Highest…. They place the heavenly and\neternal before them as an object of pleasure and unity, as the sole\ninexhaustible source of that toward which their poetry is directed.\nThey strive…to ignite a love for the Highest…This is the\nhigher priesthood that proclaims the inner meaning of all spiritual\nsecrets and speaks from the kingdom of God. (Schleiermacher, On\nReligion [translation modified]). \nIt is for these reasons that “at the time of the republic, the\nartists will not be a special class” (F. Schlegel, PF: #749). In\nsuch an ideal republic everyone must be an artist who, by means of the\npoetic spirit of love, is related to the other citizens as artists\nrelate to one another. \nStatements such as Blake’s claim, “Princes…and\nHouses of Commons & Houses of Lords [are] something Else besides\nHuman Life” (“Public Address” (1809) in PPWB) clearly display\nthe revolutionary nature of the romantics. But the romantic transition\nfrom a more liberal framework to a more conservative one is explained\nprimarily by their reaction to the terror of the French revolution.\nThough many of the romantics kept allegiance to the revolution until\nfairly late (1798), the acknowledgement of its failures and the\ndangers involved in any revolutionary act led them to modify, though\nnot to renounce, their republican ideal. Even during this stage of\ntheir development, the romantics believed that the republic offered\nthe best political structure. But, while still involving democratic\nelements, a proper republic, they argued should also involve\naristocratic and monarchical elements because the educated should rule\nover the uneducated: \nA perfect republic would have to be not just democratic but\naristocratic and monarchic at the same time: to legislate justly and\nfreely, the educated would have to outweigh and guide the uneducated,\nand everything would have to be organized into an absolute whole. (F.\nSchlegel, AF: #214) \nRather than opposed to the original romantic ideal, this late view is\na natural outgrowth of the earlier ideal since it does not only\nmaintain the early republicanism, but also continues, through\nmodification, the early romantic emphasis on Bildung as a\nnecessary condition for a proper republic. \nSince even during this later period, the romantic political ideal\nconsisted of a republican, holistic community grounded in love, art\nand aesthetics still played significant ethical and political roles in\nthe late romantic phase. Even later on in their careers, the romantics\ninsisted that art and aesthetics were crucial models and resources for\nthe pursuit of ethical and political ends. \nOne of the romantics’ central aims was to (re)enchant nature in\nthe face of what they regarded as a threat from modern science. The\nthreat was embodied primarily in the worry that modern science\nalienated (rational and free) human beings from nature, which, through\nthe lens of this new science, had been viewed as a domain of brute,\ndetermined, mechanical causality\n (§5.1).\n Aesthetics is capable of (re)enchanting nature insofar as it brings\nout a different conception of nature as organic rather than mechanic.\nOn this organic conception, nature is (a) an organic whole, which is\nreciprocally interdependent on its parts; (b) a domain of teleological\nrather than merely mechanical causality; and (c) a dynamic and living\nforce, which is self-organizing and self-generating\n (§5.2).\n “Science should become poetic” insofar as it should\napproach nature in the same way that criticism approaches romantic\npoetry. Like romantic poetry, nature should be viewed as an organic\nand spontaneous whole. Under this conception of nature, rational,\nautonomous human beings are not alienated from, but are rather part\nand parcel of, nature\n (§5.3). \nWe have fallen out with nature, and what was once (as we believe) One\nis now in conflict with itself, and mastery and servitude alternate on\nboth sides. It often seems to us as if the world were everything and\nwe nothing, but often too as if we were everything and the world\nnothing. (Hölderlin, Preface to Hyperion, HSA 3:\n326). \nHölderlin expresses here a ubiquitous romantic sentiment. Not\nonly has modernity divided man from himself by enforcing the duality\nbetween reason and sensibility and severed the individual from his\nnatural social relations (section 4), but it also alienated man from\nnature. Modern science, “[a] vulture, whose wings are dull\nrealities”, was regarded as the main culprit (Edgar Allen Poe,\n“Sonnet—To Science”). \nThrough the lens of modern science, nature was regarded as an\ninanimate, mechanistic domain of dead and meaningless matter that is\ncomposed of separate atoms and thoroughly determined by efficient\ncausality. Modern science “dissected [nature] atomistically like\na dead corpse” (Eichendorff, EW 5: 423). The romantics regarded\nthis approach to nature as reductive as much as they regarded it as\n“dissecting”: it reduces nature to mere matter,\ndevoid of the features that the romantics took to be essential to it,\nlike holistic unity, self-organization and life. The growing sense of\nman’s alienation from his natural surrounding was seen as a\nproduct of this reduction of nature: human beings seemed alienated\nfrom nature exactly because the rational, soulful and sense-making\ncharacter that is usually associated with them is opposed to a\nmechanistic and deterministic domain. \nThe troublesome consequences of this approach to nature are multiple.\nFirst, there is the psychological and existential crisis that is well\nencapsulated by Novalis’s claim, “Philosophy is actually\nhomesickness—the urge to be everywhere at home”\n(General Draft: #45), and commemorated by landmark romantic\nworks, such as Caspar David Friedrich’s “The Wanderer\nabove the Mist” (1818). \nIn the epistemological and metaphysical domains, varieties of\nskeptical doubts loom large behind the modern approach to nature. If\nmodern science is right then the relation between nature and\nnormativity is unclear. But if nature cannot provide rational norms,\nthen how can we account for and justify our empirical claims to\nknowledge (human experience)? On the flipside of this epistemological\nworry is a metaphysical concern about the nature of the subject. For\nthe subject, as the source of meaning, is seen as only\nthat—a dematerialized source of meaning, devoid not only of a\nbody, as Descartes emphasized, but, if Kant is right, of any\nsubstantiality at all (see Bernstein 2003). \nThird among the consequences is the threat to any awe-inspiring stance\ntowards the world. Not only can the divinity once attributed to nature\nno longer be found therein, but modern science was also seen as posing\na challenge to any attempt at a secular alternative to religion. Seen\nas fully accessible to the calculative part of the human mind, nature\nbecomes transparent and devoid of any mystery or human-transcending\npower. Are we left without a source of wonder, awe or reverence in our\nmodern world? \nAccording to the romantics, the way out of these worrisome\nconsequences requires that we recognize that modern science is\nreductive not only in terms of its object—nature—but also\nin terms of its methodology: modern science employs merely what\nWordsworth called the “independent intellect”. The\nromantics understood this as calculative reason when it is isolated\nfrom non-calculative reason, sensibility and imagination. Employed\nthusly, the independent intellect works as a “knife in\nhand” (Wordsworth, The Prelude (1805), book X, line\n877). \nThis is crucial because, if the romantics are to retrieve the lost\nunity of nature itself and our lost unity with nature, they must\npropose a new scientific methodology, or, what comes to the same\nthing, a new approach to nature. The romantics aspired to reform and\ncounterbalance the merely calculative, quantitative and mathematical\nuse of reason that is characteristic of modern science, and open an\nera “When no more numbers and figures feature//As the keys to\nunlock every creature” (Novalis, Henry von Ofterdingen,\nNS 1:344). Human beings should strive to return to “the laws of\nthings which lie/beyond the reach of human will or power;/The life of\nnature” (Wordsworth, “The Tables Turned”, 1798, LB)\nby adopting a more holistic approach that includes practical reason,\nsensibility, feeling, imagination, and above all the aesthetic\ncapacity of the mind. \nIt should be no surprise that this holistic approach to\nnature—the new romantic science—is, in essence, poetic. It\nis romantic poetry, which, as Athenaeum Fragments (AF) #116\nannounces, “fuses and mixes” opposing forces: reason,\nfeeling, imagination, physics, poetry, philosophy, medicine and\nalchemy—when it comes to methodology—and matter, form,\nfreedom and nature—when it comes to the object of study,\nnature: \nAnyone who finds in infinite nature nothing but one whole, one\ncomplete poem, in every word, every syllable of which the harmony of\nthe whole rings out and nothing destroys it, has won the highest prize\nof all. (Ritter, Fragmente 2: 205) \nWhile Kant’s discussions of nature, organisms and teleological\njudgment in the third Critique, and Schelling’s On\nthe World Soul (1798) and First Outline of a System of\nPhilosophy of Nature (1799) are the primary sources of\ninspiration for romantic science, the metaphysical starting point for\nthe romantic view of nature is what Fredrick Beiser aptly dubbed\n“a strange wedding plan” between Fichte’s idealism\nand Spinoza’s realistic monism (2003:\n 131).[7] \nWhy synthetize these seemingly opposed philosophical projects—a\nform of idealism with realism, indeterminism with determinism, and\ndualism with monism? Briefly, in Fichte, the romantics found a\nphilosopher that took the Kantian insight about the absolute value of\nfreedom a step further, and in Spinoza, one who recognized the genuine\nmonistic structure of the universe, where the mental (in the form of\nreason and subjectivity, the seats of freedom) is the flipped side of\nthe physical (in the form of matter and objectivity). If nature itself\nis both physical and mental, if it has a soul or reason and a body,\nthen, it differs from human beings only in degree, not in kind.\nNatural phenomena and human beings are simply different manifestations\nof an encompassing nature, which is therefore nothing other than\nSpirit: “Nature should be visible spirit, and spirit should be\ninvisible nature” (Schelling, Ideas for a Philosophy of\nNature, SW 2: 56). \nThus, the marriage between the philosophical outlooks of Fichte and\nSpinoza promises to consummate the valuable nucleus of modernity (the\nEnlightenment’s emphasis on freedom and individual rational\ncriticism), while rebutting the modern ills of division and\nalienation. It promises to allow human beings to “feel at\nhome” in a meaningful, free and natural world.  \nBut this is only the metaphysical presupposition behind the romantic\nconception of nature. Their understanding of nature, not only as\nmonistic but also as an organic whole that is self-forming and\nself-generating—in their terms, as a creative, living\nforce—is inspired by what, according to them, Kant only started\nto point to, but failed fully to develop in the third\nCritique since he restricted it to a regulative and heuristic\nconception: namely, the conception of organic nature. \nThinking about nature as Spirit, different from the human merely in\ndegree, already presupposes a holistic conception of nature, where the\nwhole is prior to the parts. For, if all individuals are, in\nSpinoza’s words “modes” of nature, namely, merely\ndifferent manifestations of the one and same whole, then these parts\nare necessarily dependent on the whole. But insofar as nature is also\nan (all encompassing) organism, then just as its parts are dependent\non it (for their existence and intelligibility), so it depends on its\nparts for its existence as the organism that it is: independently of\nits parts, an organism could not sustain its particular organization,\ni.e., its life form. In an organism, the parts are the\nreciprocal cause and effect of one another and of the\norganism as a whole. \nBut an organism is also self-organizing and\nself-forming. While the organization of artifacts is imposed\non them from outside by their producers, the particular organization\nand so the life form of any organism is self-produced. Consequently,\nto view nature as an organism is to view it dynamically—not as a\ndead matter, but as self-forming and self-generating. Indeed, for the\nromantics, nature is one living force, whose different parts—not\nonly self-conscious philosophers, creative artists, animals, plants,\nand minerals, but also kinds of matter—are different stages of\nits organization. \nFrom moss, in which the trace of organization is hardly visible, to\nthe noble Form [Gestalt] which seems to have shed the chains\nof matter, the one and same drive within rules, a drive that strives\nto work according to one and the same ideal of purposiveness, strives\nto express ad infinitum one and the same archetype\n[Urbild], the pure form of our Spirit. (Schelling,\n“Review of the Newest in Philosophical Literature,\n1796”) \nBeauty in nature and art is a key for this organic and dynamic\nconception of nature for multiple reasons. First, the holistic and\nunifying character of poetry is suitable not only for the reformed\nscientific methodology that fuses together reason, imagination and\nfeeling, but also for unraveling analogies and unities that are\nusually hidden from the bare eye, for example, the unity between kinds\nof matter and self-conscious human beings as different stages in the\norganization of the same life force. \nSecond, natural beauties and artworks inspire an interest in natural\norganization and life by their analogy with organisms, or as the\nromantics often put it, by being themselves organic in nature.  \nThe transcendental poetry of the future could be called organic. When\nit is invented it will be seen that all true poets up to now made\npoetry organically without knowing it. (Novalis,\nLogological Fragments: I, #38).  \nArtworks and natural beauties are analogous to organisms in various\nrespects. \nTo begin with, the analogy concerns their structure or unity. Both\nhave holistic unities, where the parts and the whole are reciprocally\ninterdependent. Artworks and natural beauties are so structured since\n(1) their beauty as a whole depends on the existence and the exact\norganization of their parts (for, if, say, any of the specific shapes,\nhues, or composition of a painting were to change, the painting as a\nwhole may not be beautiful any longer), and (2) their parts are\nrecognized as what they are (as beauty-making parts, or parts of a\nbeautiful object) only in light of the whole (so that, for\nexample, a mere shade of white may be beautiful only in light of the\nbeauty of the painting to which it contributes as a whole, but not\nnecessarily beautiful on its own, or when it figures in any other\nobject). “In poetry”, then, just as in organisms,\n“every whole can be a part and every part really a whole”\n(F. Schlegel, CF: #14). \nKant claimed that the main difference between the holistic unity of\norganisms and the holistic unities of artworks and natural beauties is\nthe difference between a causal or existential unity and what he\ncalled a formal unity. In organic life, the reciprocal interdependence\nbetween parts and wholes is causal and existential in the sense that\nit is life-sustaining. Kant thought that in aesthetics, the reciprocal\ninterdependence is formal, rather than causal or existential, in the\nsense that it does not explain the existence of the objects\nat stake, but their beauty. While, for example, a painting might\ncontinue to exist as a painting even if some of its parts changed\n(say, if its composition, shapes, or hues changed), the beauty of this\npainting is unlikely to survive such a change. In this case, it is the\nbeauty of the whole painting that depends on its parts, and\nit is the beauty of the parts, rather than their existence,\nthat depends on the beauty of the whole: for were the painting as a\nwhole not beautiful, its parts would not be recognized as what they\nare, namely, beauty-making parts.  \nThe romantics seemed to diverge from Kant on that matter. For them,\ngreat poetry is materially and not merely formally organic: \nThe innate impulse of this work [Wilhelm Meister], so\norganized and organizing down to its finest detail to form a whole. No\nbreak is accidental or insignificant;…everything is at the same\ntime both means and end. (F. Schlegel, WM: 273–74) \nThis means that the romantics took the work of art to be analogous to\norganisms in yet a stronger sense—not only in terms of its\nholistic unity, but also in terms of its life—its\nself-organization and self-judgment. Recall the sui\ngeneris character of artworks (discussed in\n §3.2):\n each work constitutes the norms according to which alone it could be\nproperly judged. In romantic terms, every work has its own\nself-judgment. Seen as such, the artwork is not a mere\nartifact, but a quasi-organism in the sense that it organizes\nand regulates itself. And like other organic products of nature, the\nwork too has, as it were, a life of its own, even though it is not\nself-organizing in the strict sense:  \nJust as a child is only a thing which wants to become a human being,\nso a poem is only a product of nature which wants to become a work of\nart. (F. Schlegel, CF: #21)  \nIt is the holistic unity and life in the aesthetic domain that draws\nour attention to organisms and inspires us to seek the organic\nstructure of nature as a whole. \nThird, following Kant, the romantics believed that the beauty of\nnature reveals the purposiveness without a purpose of nature as a\nwhole. It inspires and guides us in seeing nature as purposively\norganized—organized as if according to a specific\npurpose—even though we cannot attribute this purposive structure\nto any will, creator, or any end-governed activity: \nThat which reminds us of nature and thus stimulates a feeling for the\ninfinite abundance of life is beautiful. Nature is organic, and\ntherefore, the highest beauty is forever vegetative; and the same is\ntrue for morality and love. (F. Schlegel, Ideas: #86) \nWhile this view is to be found in the third Critique, the\nromantics went a few steps further than Kant: first, they considered\npurposiveness, teleological structure and life real features of\nnature, rather than regulative principles for approaching nature.\nSecond, they took these features to indicate that nature is different\nfrom self-conscious, creative human beings only in degree, but not in\nkind: like human beings, nature is end-governed. It is beauty, above\nall, that inspires this realization. As Novalis puts it,\n“Through beauty, nature transforms itself into a human\nbeing” (Heinrich von Ofterdingen, NS 1), the same being\nthat governs itself by creatively and self-consciously setting ends.\nThe more we properly attend to beauty and art the more capable we\nwould be of seeing nature and humanity as different aspects of a\nsingle, unified phenomenon:  \nActually criticism…that doctrine which in the study of\nnature directs our attention to ourselves…and in the study of\nourselves directs it to the outside world, to outer observations and\nexperiments—is…the most fruitful of all\nindications. It allows us to sense nature, or the outside\nworld, like a human being. (Novalis, General Draft:\n#42). \nAesthetics is central for the romantic “scientific\nrevolution” for yet another reason that concerns its capacity to\n“enchant” nature. “Enchanting” stands here for\nthe process of rendering nature magical, or mysterious, and thus\ninspiring reverence and awe (see Stone 2005). While bringing out\nnature’s organic structure is decisive for rebutting modern\nalienation, enchantment is required primarily for challenging two\nother consequences of modern science: the threat of a detached and\nunresponsive treatment of nature and what the romantics regarded as a\nthreat of secularization. Not only did modern science portray nature\nas a brute domain of mechanism, and thus devoid of any awe-inspiring\npower, but it also rendered it completely transparent to the human\nmind, and thus lacking in the kind of mystery and magic that may\ninspire awe in a secular world. Changing our attitude towards nature\nand inspiring awe for it requires that we recover a sense of mystery\nand magic in nature, and, indeed, in everything ordinary, in\neverything that we have come to take for granted. This\nprocess—of recovering a sense of mystery and magic in nature and\nthe ordinary—is so central in romanticism that it takes on the\nmovement’s name: \nRomanticizing is nothing other than a qualitative raising into higher\npower…. By giving a higher meaning to the ordinary, a\nmysterious appearance to the ordinary, the dignity of the unacquainted\nto that of which we are acquainted, the mere appearance of infinity to\nfinite, I romanticize them. (Novalis, Logological Fragments:\n#66) \nPoetry is most suitable for the business of romanticizing by virtue of\ntwo of its main features: (a) its “defamiliarizing” power,\nand, (b) its “ironic” ability to point to the limits of\nour knowledge, and thus to what must remain mysterious—beyond\nour cognitive capacities. \nFirst, by virtue of its power to subtly describe even the most\nconcrete of details and to bring to life even what, independently of\nit, attracts no attention, poetry has a special capacity for\ndefamiliarization—a power that was first noticed by the\nromantics in their account of “romanticizing”, but dubbed\n“defamiliarization” only later, by 20th century\nliterary theorists. By its non-ordinary use of language, attention to\ndetails and evoking power, poetry brings out in vivid colors what we\nare usually blind to, even if it is, literally, the closest and most\nfamiliar to us. Poetry has the power to make the most familiar new,\nrefreshing, and thus, other than familiar—different and even\nmysterious. \nLike Novalis, Wordsworth is one of the first proponents of\nromanticizing in this sense. He instructs: while romantic poetry\nshould start with the most familiar and contingent—“the\nincidents and situations from common life”—it should also\nstrive to elevate them by  \nthrow[ing] over them a certain coloring of the imagination, whereby\nordinary things should be presented to the mind in an unusual way; and\nfurther and above all [poetry should aim] to make these incidents and\nsituations interesting by tracing in them…the primary laws of\nour nature. (Preface to the Lyrical Ballads.)  \nWordsworth calls on poets to write in the language of “low and\nrustic life”. But it is exactly the poetic use of this language\nthat allows the “passions” of those whose language it\nis—ordinary people—to be “incorporated with the\nbeautiful and permanent forms of Nature” (ibid.). And it is\nthrough this process of romanticizing that nature appears again as\ngreat and awe-inspiring, “The great Nature that exists in\nwords/Of might Poets” (Wordsworth, The Prelude (1805),\nBook V, lines 618–19). \nSecond, romantic poetry is essentially ironic insofar as it brings our\nfinitude, particularly the limits of our knowledge, to consciousness\n(see\n §2.2).\n While romantic irony is the basis for a way of life that is centered\non humility, it also paves the way for awe and reverence for it\nsuggests that there is much beyond our comprehension, much that\nremains mysterious, incomprehensible, greater than our capacities and\npossibly infinite rather than finite like us. There is much around us\nthat merits awe. \nWordsworth’s description of nature is possibly the most powerful\nportrayal of the awe-inspiring character of nature as it is revealed\nby the poetic imagination: \nA sense sublime\n\nOf something far more deeply interfused,\n\nWhose dwelling is the light of setting suns,\n\nAnd the round ocean, and the living air,\n\nAnd the blue sky, in the mind of man,\n\nA motion and a spirit, that impels,\n\nAll thinking things, all objects of all thought,\n\nAnd rolls through all things.\n\n…\n\nI, so long\n\nA worshipper of Nature, hither came,\n\nUnwearied in that service: rather say\n\nWith warmer love, oh! With far deeper zeal\n\nOf holier love.\n\n(Wordsworth, “Lines Written a Few Miles above Tintern\nAbbey” (1798), lines 96–103 and 154–57, in LB) \nThrough the romantic lens, then, nature becomes alive and a locus of\nSpirit. Rather than an alien force, nature speaks to us as we speak to\nit and to each other.  \nNature is a temple where living columns\n\nSometimes let confused words come out;\n\nMan walks through these forests of symbols\n\nWhich observe him with a familiar gaze.\n\n(La Nature est un temple où de vivants piliers\n\nLaissent parfois sortir de confuses paroles\n\nL'homme y passe à travers des forêts de symbols\n\nQui l'observent avec des regards familiers) \n\n(Baudelaire,\nCorrespondences, 1861 [2000])  \nThis is liberating and re-enchanting, but it also puts certain demands\non us, for example, the demands to love nature as we love other human\nbeings: \nOh, most magnificent and noble Nature!\n\nHave I not worshipped thee with such a love\n\nAs never mortal man before displayed?\n\nAdored thee in thy majesty of visible creation,\n\nAnd searched into thy hidden and mysterious ways\n\nAs Poet, as Philosopher, as Sage?\n\n(unknown date, Humphry Davy [1778–1829], Fragmentary\nRemains, 14) \nAs eccentric as the romantic call to poeticize nature and science may\ninitially seem, it is arguably of relevance today. The organic and\nre-enchanted conception of nature did not only anticipate some\ncurrents in the modern ecological movement, but it also contains\nresources for further developments in contemporary environmental\nphilosophy and philosophy of science. \nInterestingly, scholars tend to explain romantic aesthetics not only\nin terms of its sources (discussed in\n §2.1),\n but also in terms of its legacy. While there are very interesting and\nwell-established connections between romantic aesthetics and modernism\n(see Abrams 1971, Frye 1968, Cavell 1979), this section focuses on the\nattempt to draw a link between the former and postmodernism, a link\nwhose ground is significantly weaker. \nIn recent decades, a large number of romantic scholars have argued\nthat romanticism, in general, and the romantic primacy of aesthetics,\nin particular, is a precursor of the fundamental outlook of\npostmodernist and poststructuralist views (see, for example,\nLacoue-Labarthe and Nancy 1988, Bowie 2003, Bowman 2014, and Gasche\n1991). This reading is based on the skepticism the romantics raised\nabout first principles and about systematicity, the romantic emphasis\non human creation and language, historicism and hermeneutics, their\nview of the fragmented nature of modern life and on certain\nformulations of the primacy of aesthetics that may seem, initially, to\nerase any distinction between what is “real” and what is\n“poetic”, a product of the creative imagination. Friedrich\nSchlegel, for example, proclaims: “No poetry, no\nreality…. There is, despite all the senses, no external world\nwithout imagination” (AF: #350), and “Everything that\nrests on the opposition between appearance and reality…is not\npurely poetic” (FLP: #146).  \nThese proclamations may seem to suggest that “there is no way\nout” of creative constructions, or “texts”, or that\n“art…does not need to point beyond itself” (Bowie\n2003: 53), as if romantic aesthetics anticipates central trends in\npost-modernism and\n post-structuralism.[8]\n But there are reasons to worry about such a\n“postmodernist” reading. Some lines in\nromanticism—skepticism about foundationalist philosophy and\nsystem-building, the emphasis on human creation, language, and the\nrole of historicism and hermeneutics—are indeed related to\ncertain strands in postmodernism. But reading romantic aesthetics as\nproto-postmodernist is limited for a host of reasons. \nFirst, the romantic faith in the imaginative and emotive capacities\nassociated with the production and reception of art, and their\nskepticism of absolute principles and philosophical systems did not\nmake them skeptical of reason, as many postmodernist thinkers are (see\n §2.1\n and Beiser 2003: 3). Even romantic skepticism of absolute principles\n(see\n §3.1).\n cannot be equated with the rejection of all principles and rules. For\nexample, though art and art appreciation cannot be reduced to any\ngiven, prior rules, they are not lawless, but the source of their own\nnormativity (see\n §3.3). \nSecond, in spite of the romantic stress on the fragmentary nature of\nhuman experience (embodied in their choice of the aphoristic style,\nwhich is emphasized by their post-modernist readers), the romantics\nnever gave up the striving after unity and wholeness. Art was not\nmeant as a replacement for unity, but exactly as the best way to\nstrive after and approximate unity in our modern and fragmentary\ncondition.  \nFor the philosopher…art is supreme, for it opens to him the\nholiest of holies, where that which is separated in nature and\nhistory, and which can never be united either in life and action or in\nthought, burns as though in a single flame in eternal and primordial\nunity. (Schelling, System of Transcendental Philosophy, 1800,\nin Heath 1978: 231) \nThird, the romantics’ desire for and search after the Absolute\n(discussed in 3) is another reason to reject the post-modernist\ninterpretation. For such a desire is anathema to most post-modernist\nthinkers, who resist and shun the possibility (and desirability) of\nany absolute reality. \nMoreover, if one opposes the idea that there is “no way out of\ntexts”, or that reality is “nothing other than\nconstruction”, then the post-modernist reading of the romantics\nappears uncharitable. Fortunately, this interpretation does not force\nitself on us since there are many other charitable and (historically,\ntextually and philosophically) well-grounded readings of the\nproclamations just mentioned and of the romantic primacy of the\naesthetics. Many of these readings were proposed in this entry under\nthe umbrella of the formal approach to romantic aesthetics. On this\nformal account, rather than claiming that there is no distinction\nbetween “reality” and “fiction”, or that there\nis “no way out of imaginative constructions”, the\nromantics urged human beings to fashion their ordinary life and\nphilosophy aesthetically for epistemological, metaphysical, ethical,\npolitical and scientific reasons. \nArguably, romantic aesthetics is not of merely historical interest.\nThis entry has pointed to a few facets of the relevance of romantic\naesthetics, thus supporting views like Berlin’s, for example,\naccording to which the revolution brought about by romanticism is\n“the deepest and most lasting of all changes in the life of the\nWest…” (1999: xiii). Its tremendous impact on generations\nto come all the way up to the present day is one explanation of the\ndifficulty of precisely delimiting when the age of romanticism begins\nand when it ends. Indeed, rather than a post-romantic age, our age may\nbe yet another phase in the age of romanticism:  \nRomanticism…is the first major phase in an imaginative\nrevolution which has carried on until our own day, and has by no means\ncompleted itself yet.
