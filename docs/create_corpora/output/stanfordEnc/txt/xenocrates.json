D.L. says he\nheld that position for twenty-five years, and died at 82. So his dates\nwork out to 396/395–314/313.\n\n\nOn the death of Plato, when Speusippus became head of the Academy,\nXenocrates and Aristotle may have left Athens together at the\ninvitation of Hermeias of Atarneus (see Strabo XIII 57, printed in\nGaiser 1988, 380–381, discussed at 384–385), and\nXenocrates returned to succeed Speusippus. According to D.L. (iv 3),\nthis was at Speusippus’ request, while the Academicorum Index\nHerculanensis (cols. VI-VII: Mekler 1902, 38–39, Gaiser\n1988, 193) tells us that the younger members of the Academy voted on\nthe succession and confirmed Xenocrates by a narrow margin. These two\naccounts, although not incompatible, do not tell the same story, and\nit does not appear  possible to get behind them to what really\nhappened.\n\n\nD.L.’s bibliography (iv 11–14) lists over 70 titles; nothing\nwhatever of these has survived, even in the form of identifiable\nquotations in other authors. Reconstruction of Xenocrates’ views\nturns, as in the case of Speusippus, on Aristotle, and, again as in\nthe case of Speusippus, this is made the more difficult by Aristotle’s\nfrequent failure actually to name Xenocrates when talking about his\nviews. In fact, Aristotle never mentions Xenocrates by name in\ndiscussing his metaphysical views.\n\n\nWhat is left of Xenocrates’ views is here divided up under three\nheadings: Metaphysics, Theory of Knowledge, and Ethics. Sextus\nEmpiricus tells us (Adversus mathematicos vii 16; fr. 1H,\n82IP: here and in the sequel ‘H’ refers to the collection\nof fragments in Heinze 1892 and ‘IP’ to that in Isnardi\nParente 1982) that Xenocrates was explicit about the division of\nphilosophical topics implicit in Plato, into ‘physics’,\n‘ethics’, and ‘logic’; this became the norm in\nStoicism and Hellenistic philosophy in general. We have a great deal\nmore to work with under the first heading than under the other two. As\nis standard with this terminology, what we are accustomed to refer to\nas metaphysics and theory of knowledge are included in\n‘physics’ and ‘logic’, respectively.\n\n\nSextus’ report about the standard division of philosophy coming\nthrough Xenocrates but ultimately from Plato is typical of much of\nwhat we hear about Xenocrates: he appears to have been at least as\nconcerned to carry on the thought of Plato as to promulgate ideas of\nhis own.\n\nMost of what we can reconstruct about Xenocrates pertains to his\nmetaphysics. We do this largely by identifying views of his that\nappear in Aristotle’s criticisms of the metaphysical views of his\npredecessors and contemporaries, and chaining together with these\nother texts that can plausibly be taken as dealing with his views. But\nthere are a few sources other than Aristotle. \nOne of them is Proclus, who says, commenting on the\nParmenides (Cousin 1864, 888.11–19, 36–38; fr.\n30H, 94IP): \n‘The founder’ is Plato. The phrase ‘mounted on a\nholy pedestal’ comes from Plato, Phaedrus 254b7, where\nthe soul has been likened to a charioteer who sees the Forms of the\nbeautiful and temperance so mounted. Some of the phrasing is no doubt\nneoplatonist rather than Xenocratean, but the formulation, ‘the\nidea is a paradigmatic cause’, seems to be, as Proclus says,\nXenocrates’ attempt to capture Plato’s intent: see here Plato,\nParmenides 132d. \nThere is disagreement over the rest of the formulation Proclus\nattributes to Xenocrates: in speaking of ‘the things that are\nalways constituted according to nature’, did Xenocrates intend\nto rule out forms for individuals, which are transitory, and for\nartefacts, which are not constituted according to nature? This is the\nway Proclus goes on to interpret Xenocrates, and it is hard to see how\nto get around that, although attempts have been made (see Cherniss\n1944 [1962], 256). But there is indirect confirmation of Proclus’\ninterpretation, at least where artefacts are concerned, from Clement\nof Alexandria, who tells us (in Stromateis II 5) that\nXenocrates claimed that knowledge of the intelligible substance is\ntheoretical as opposed to practical ‘judgment’; at that\nrate, carpenters are not contemplating forms when they make beds and\nshuttles, despite what is said by Plato in Republic X 596b\nand Cratylus 389a–b, and (if it is by Plato) Letter\nvii 342d. But it should be noted that the rejection of forms for\nartefacts is in agreement with what Aristotle has to say about Plato\nand Platonists in Metaphysics I 9. 991b6–7, XII 3.\n1070a13–19, and in the fragmentary remains of On Ideas\nin Alexander (see esp. Hayduck 1891, 79.23–24, 80.6). Likewise\nthe rejection of forms for individuals squares with Aristotle’s attack\non the ‘argument from thinking’ (Metaphysics I 9.\n990b14–15 = XIII 4. 1079a10–11, supplemented by Alexander,\nHayduck 1891, 81.25–82.7): if every object of thought is a form,\nthen there are forms also “for the perishables” (990b14 =\n1079b10) or “for the particulars and perishables, such as\nSocrates, Plato” (Alexander, Hayduck 1891, 82.2–3). \nThe version of the Theory of Forms associated with Xenocrates is that\nwhich Aristotle ascribes to the later Plato (see Metaphysics\nXIII 4. 1078b10–12 for the qualification ‘later’),\nin which the Forms are ‘generated’ and are, in the first\ninstance, numbers. Xenocrates operated, in parallel with Speusippus\nand Plato (as Aristotle reports Plato), with a scheme in which two\nprinciples--the One and something called any or all of ‘the\neverflowing’, ‘plurality’ (Aëtius i 3. 23), or\n‘the Indefinite Dyad’ (Theophrastus, Metaphysics\nvi)--generate these form-numbers, and then, in turn, lines, planes,\nsolids, and perceptible things. \nThe talk of generation Xenocrates reinterpreted as a mere pedagogical\ndevice; we hear about this technique from Aristotle, De caelo\nI 10. 279b32–280a2, and Simplicius’ commentary ad loc. (Heiberg\n1893, 303.33–34) names Xenocrates in this connection, as does\nPlutarch (De animae procreatione in Timaeo 3. 1013a–b,\nCherniss 1976, 168–171). Here it is a device for interpreting\nthe creation story in the Timaeus; that Xenocrates also\napplied it to the generation of the formal numbers we learn from\nAristotle, Metaphysics XIV 4. 1091a28–29 and the\ncommentary on that passage in pseudo-Alexander (Hayduck 1891,\n819.37–820.3). \nIn trying to understand what Aristotle tells us about formal numbers,\nit is necessary to bear in mind the fundamental distinction he draws\nbetween formal numbers and mathematical numbers: both are, according\nto Aristotle, composed of units, but formal numbers are composed of\nvery strange units, such that those in one formal number cannot be\ncombined with those in any other. The units of which mathematical\nnumbers are composed can be added and subtracted freely. (See here\nMetaphysics XIII 6. 1080a15–b4.) And furthermore there\nis only one formal number for each of the numbers 2, 3, 4, etc., where\nthere are indefinitely many instances of each among the mathematical\nnumbers. (See here Metaphysics I 6. 987b14–18.) The\nmathematical numbers are the ones mathematicians work with, e.g. in\nperforming arithmetical operations, and that is presumably why they\nare called ‘mathematical’. There is a corresponding\ndivision between types of geometrical figures, but we hear too little\nabout this; most of what follows will be concerned with numbers. \nThe position that there are both formal numbers and mathematical\nnumbers Aristotle ascribes to Plato. Speusippus rejects the formal\nnumbers (and the entire theory of forms along with them; see the entry\non\n Speusippus).\n The position Aristotle ascribes to Xenocrates is a bit more\nelusive. \nIn Metaphysics VII 2, Aristotle tells us, in\n1028b19–21, that Plato accepted three sorts of entities: forms,\nmathematicals, and perceptibles; in this context that means formal\nnumbers, mathematical numbers, and perceptibles. He then, in\nb21–24, talks about Speusippus’ views (see the entry on\n Speusippus).\n In both cases he gives us the names. Then, in b24–27 he says\nthis: \nAsclepius’ commentary on this passage (Hayduck 1888, 379.17–22)\ntells us that it is dealing with Xenocrates. \nThe core of Xenocrates’ view is that “the forms and the numbers\nhave the same nature:” that is, the formal numbers and the\nmathematical numbers have the same nature. A series of half a dozen\npassages in the Metaphysics can, in consequence of this\nidentification, be associated with Xenocrates (see XII 1.\n1069a30–b2, XIII 1. 1076a20, 6. 1080b21–30, 8.\n1083b1–8, 9. 1086a5–11, XIV 3. 1090b13–1091a5). From\nthese passages it appears that he is saying that the distinction\nbetween formal and mathematical numbers (as well as the corresponding\ndistinction among geometrical objects) is unnecessary; he does this by\nassimilating mathematical numbers to form-numbers and telling us that\nmathematics can be done entirely with formal numbers. In other words,\nsince he thinks that mathematics can be done with formal numbers, he\nfeels it acceptable to call formal numbers mathematical numbers. \n1086a5–9 makes it sound as if some part of Xenocrates’ case for\nhis position was based on the consideration that all that can be based\non the two ultimate principles, the One and the Indefinite Dyad, is\nthe series of formal numbers. Without some further comment, it is hard\nto see much of an argument here, but we may be able to piece together\na little about the relationship of the numbers to the One. In Eudemian\nEthics (I 8. 1218a24–33) Aristotle attacks an Academic\n‘demonstration’  aimed at showing that The One is the\ngood itself, i.e the Idea of the good. He calls it\n‘tricky’ or ‘bizarre’ (translations of\nparabolos vary considerably), and it is indeed bizarre: from the\npremises that the numbers aim for unification and that “all the\nthings that are aim for some one good” it concludes that the\ngood itself must be the One. As it stands, this is gappy, but what is\nreally bizzare is the first premise, that numbers strive to get their\nunits to stick together; that is too much for Aristotle (and no doubt\nfor the rest of us as well). \n\nIn the passage of Proclus’ Parmenides commentary cited above\nthere appears a passage dealing with a view that makes the\nparticipants in an Idea ‘aim for’ that Idea, which in turn\naims for that which ‘comes before’ it, which must be the\nOne. So Xenocrates looks to be the source for the\n‘bizarre’ demonstration, and if so he is invoking final\ncausality in relating the forms (which are formal numbers) to the One.\nAristotle himself has the heavenly spheres move as they do out of a\ndesire to emulate the unmoved mover (Metaphysics XII 7. 1072a26-b4),\nand even says that the matter in a form/matter compound ‘aims\nat’ its form (Physics I 9. 192a16–25), so this use of final\ncausality was, one supposes, Academic. But about Xenocrates’\n‘demonstration’ Aristotle is merciless: “one should\n… not without reason give any credit at all to things it is not\neasy to believe even with reason”. \nIt may help a little, but not a lot, to notice that Xenocrates makes\n(see below) the soul is a self-moving number.  In any case, the\nresulting position is possibly quite unstable: Aristotle certainly\nthinks so. For Plato and Speusippus, the addition of 2 and 3 is a\nmatter of putting together a group of units that is a mathematical 2\nwith a disjoint group of units that is a mathematical 3 (that numbers\nare such collections of units is a view that can still be found later,\nperhaps most importantly, given his influence, in\nEuclid, Elements VII def. 2). Aristotle, too, understood\naddition in this way, although with a completely different take on the\nunderlying ontology. We do not know how Xenocrates understood\naddition: perhaps as a sort of map telling you that if you are on the\nunique formal number 2 and you want to add the unique formal number 3\nto it, you cannot, strictly speaking, do that, but taking three steps\non in the series will get you to the unique formal number 5, and that\nis what ‘2 + 3 = 5’ really means. There is, as far as I\nknow, no evidence to support this conjecture, but it has the advantage\nof explaining Aristotle’s complaint, voiced more than once in\nthe passages cited (see 1080b28–30, 1083b4–6,\n1086a9–11), that Xenocrates actually makes doing mathematics\nimpossible: he ends up destroying mathematical number, and if the\nabove guess should be correct about Xenocrates’ handling of\naddition, it is readily seen how someone of Aristotle’s\npersuasion might think that Xenocrates is not so much explaining\naddition as explaining it away. \nAristotle complains in 1080b28–30 that on Xenocrates’ view\nit is not so that every two units make up a pair, and also that on his\nview not every geometrical magnitude divides into smaller\nmagnitudes. This has to do with Xenocrates’ acceptance of the\nidea that there are indivisible lines; this idea Aristotle ascribes to\nPlato in\nMetaphysics I 9. 992a20–22, and Alexander’s commentary\non that passage adds the name Xenocrates, in a way that suggests that\nXenocrates’ acceptance of indivisible magnitudes was even better known\nthan Plato’s (Hayduck 1891, 120.6–7; see also Simplicius on\nDe caelo, Heiberg 1894, 563.21–22 and many other\npassages in the commentators in which this ascription occurs: frs.\n41–49H, 123–147IP). As Proclus understood Xenocrates’\nposition, it applied to the Form of the line rather than to\ngeometrical or physical magnitudes (see Diehl 1904,\n245.30–246.4), but this is very much a minority view: Porphyry\nis quoted by Simplicius in the latter’s commentary on the\nPhysics (Diels 1882, 140.9–13) as saying that,\naccording to Xenocrates, what is: \nThis suggests that Xenocrates might have thought he could do with the\nnotion of a line what Aristotle was prepared to do with\nnotions such as man. Aristotle is prepared to say that a man\nis indivisible, and so a suitable unit for the arithmetician’s\ncontemplation, in the sense that if you divide a man into two parts\nwhat you get is not two men (see Metaphysics XIII 3.\n1078a23–26). Xenocrates may have thought the notion of a line\ncould be made to work in the same way: beyond a certain point,\ndivisions will no longer yield lines. It is difficult to think how he\ncould have made this plausible; once again, one can see why Aristotle\nmight have regarded Xenocrates’ position as unmathematical. \nXenocrates’ espousal of indivisible magnitudes has led to the\nconjecture that the pseudo-Aristotelian treatise On Indivisible\nLines is at least in part an attack on him, and that the\narguments recounted in its first chapter in favor of the claim that\nthere are indivisible lines, which are rebutted in the sequel, might\ncome from Xenocrates. Unfortunately, those arguments are quite\nobscure, and the text itself is not in very good shape (an admirably\nconcise summary of the first four of these arguments may be found in\nFurley 1967, 105). But some of the arguments owe a lot to Zeno of\nElea: that Xenocrates was influenced by Zeno is only what one would\nexpect, and is confirmed elsewhere (see esp. the passage from Porphyry\ncited in part above, apud Simplicius on the Physics,\nDiels 1882, 140.6–18). \nIn the passage of Metaphysics VII 2 quoted above, after we\nget the identification of formal and mathematical numbers, with the\nformal numbers actually carrying the weight, there is a brief\ndescription of the rest of the universe: “while the others,\nlines and planes, come next, {and so on} down to the substance of the\nheavens and to the perceptibles.” It appears that Xenocrates\npictured the universe as unfolding in the sequence: (1) forms =\nnumbers; (2) lines; (3) planes; (4) solids; (5) solids in motion, i.e.\nastronomical bodies; …; (n) ordinary perceptible things. Solid\nshapes aren’t mentioned in this sentence, but they were earlier, in\n1028b17–18, and they are a standard stage in this sequence. \nThere is here an implicit contrast between Xenocrates and Speusippus,\nwhose universe was to Aristotle discontinuous or disjointed:\nXenocrates’ universe is at least a more orderly one (see the entry on\n Speusippus).\n And something like this rather faint praise is echoed in\nTheophrastus’ Metaphysics. Theophrastus complains that\nPythagoreans and Platonists fail to give us a full story about the\nconstruction of the universe: they just go so far and stop\n(6a15–b6). Then he says (6b6–9): \nSo we have it from Aristotle that Xenocrates’ universe showed\ncontinuity, and from Theophrastus that it covered everything. Of\ncourse, we do not know how. \nExactly what Theophrastus means by ‘the divine things’ is\nhard to say. There are two candidates: the objects of astronomical\nstudies, which would connect with Aristotle’s account, or those of\ntheological studies, about which Xenocrates also had much to say.\nThese are not exclusive candidates. A passage in Aëtius (Diels\n1879, 304b1–14) tells us that Xenocrates took the ‘unit\nand the dyad’ to be gods, the first male and the second female,\nand also thought of the heavenly bodies as gods; in addition he\nsupposed there were sublunary daimones. These latter were\nbeings intermediary between gods and men, also mentioned in Plato,\nSymposium 202d–203a. \nWe hear more about the gods, daimones, and men from Plutarch,\nwho tells us (De defectu oraculorum 416c–d, Babbitt\n1936, 386–387) that Xenocrates associated them with types of\ntriangle: gods with equilateral ones, daimones with isosceles\nones, and men with scalene triangles: as isosceles triangles are\nintermediate between equilateral ones and scalene ones, so\ndaimones are intermediate between gods and men. According to\nPlutarch (417b, De Iside et Osiride 360d–f: in Babbitt\n1936, 390–391 and 58–61, respectively.), Xenocrates’\ndaimones come in good and bad varieties: they may have had\nsomething to do with the explanation of the existence of evil. \nIn addition, there are isolated snatches of other views of Xenocrates\nthat might fall under the heading ‘metaphysics’. \nSimplicius, in his commentary on Aristotle’s Categories\n(Kalbfleisch 1907, 63.21–24) tells us that Xenocrates objected\nto Aristotle’s list of ten categories as too long: he thought all that\nwas needed was the distinction, visible in Plato, between things that\nare ‘by virtue of themselves’ and things that are\n‘relative to something’ (see, e.g., Sophist 255c,\nand Dancy 1999). The standard examples help clarify this: the terms\nman and horse are of the first sort, whereas\nlarge, relative to small, good relative to\nbad, etc., are of the latter type. \nThere was, it appears from a text also preserved by Simplicius (in his\ncommentary on the Physics, Diels 1882, 247.30–248.20,\nfrom Hermodorus, an early associate of Plato’s), an internal\nconnection between these ‘old academic categories’ and the\nOne and the Indefinite Dyad. The One was the heading over the category\nof things that are ‘by virtue of themselves’: such things\nare standalone entities, one thing. The Indefinite Dyad was\nthe heading over the category of relatives: such a term refers to an\nindefinite continuum pointing in two directions. All this is referred\nto Plato, not Xenocrates, but if Xenocrates accepted Plato’s later\ntheory, or at least some of it, he presumably accepted this as well,\nand saw in Aristotle’s proliferation of categories a threat to the\nbasic two principles he shared with Plato. \nA text preserved in Arabic (see Pines 1961) has Alexander of\nAphrodisias criticizing Xenocrates for saying that the (less general)\nspecies is prior to the (more general) genus because the latter, being\nan element in the definitions of the former, is a part of them (and\nwholes are subsequent to parts). \nA long passage in Themistius’ commentary on Aristotle’s De\nanima (Heinze 1899, 11.18–12.33) seems to stem from\nXenocrates’ On Nature (in 11.37–12.1 Themistius says\n“It is possible to gather all these {things} from the On\nNature of Xenocrates”). This is a discussion of a story\nabout the composition of the soul from the formal numbers 1, 2, 3, and\n4 (although 1 was not normally considered a number), mentioned in\nDe anima 408b18–27. The motivation for this account of\nthe soul, in both Aristotle and Themistius, is the explanation of how\nwe can know things about the universe: the universe is derivative from\nthose numbers, and so, if the soul is similarly derivative, the soul\ncan know things under the principle that like things are known by\nlike. This cognitive sort of account is contrasted with another\nmotivic type of account, that takes as the primary thing to be\nexplained the fact that the soul can initiate motion. \nHowever, it is quite clear that, even if the story about the reduction\nof the soul to numbers stems from Xenocrates’ On Nature, the\nnumerical reduction was supposed by Themistius not to be Xenocrates’,\nbut (perhaps) Plato’s. Aristotle and Themistius both give separate\nmention to the account of the soul that is traditionally ascribed to\nXenocrates: that it is a self-moving number (De anima\n408b32–33; Themistius in 12.30–33; the ascription to\nXenocrates is supported by a large number of texts gathered as frs.\n60H, 165–187IP: e.g., Alexander of Aphrodisias on Aristotle’s\nTopics, Wallies 1891, 162.17). Both Aristotle and Themistius\ncharacterize this account as an attempt to combine the cognitive and\nthe motivic ways of thinking about the soul; as Themistius puts it\n(12.30–33): \nThemistius does not here tell us that this is Xenocrates’ account, but\nhe does later on (see esp. 32.19–34, which refers expressly to\nXenocrates’ On Nature book 5). \nAs already noted, this heading comes under ‘logic’ in\nSextus Empiricus. No one reports anything for Xenocrates about what we\nwould think of as pure logic; Sextus (Adversus mathematicos\nvii 147–149) gives us a scrap about epistemology. Xenocrates is\nsupposed to have divided the substances or entities into three groups:\nperceptible, intelligible, and believable (also referred to as\n‘composite’ and ‘mixed’). The intelligible\nones were objects of knowledge, which Xenocrates apparently spoke of\nas ‘epistemonic logos’ or ‘knowing account’,\nand were ‘located’ outside the heavens. The perceptible\nones were objects of perception, which was capable of attaining truth\nabout them but nothing that counted as knowledge; they were within the\nheavens. The composite ones were the heavenly objects themselves, and\nobjects of belief, which is sometimes true and sometimes false. \nThis scheme descends from that in Plato, Republic V ad\nfin., where the objects of knowledge were differentiated from\nthose of belief, and from Republic VI ad fin., where\nthat division is portrayed on a divided line. In the latter passage,\nPlato seems actually to have four divisions of types of cognition and\ntheir objects, but this is notoriously difficult (see Burnyeat 1987),\nand Xenocrates appears to have rethought it. His tripartite division\nof objects looks like that in Aristotle, Metaphysics XII\n1. \nThe phrase ‘epistemonic logos’ is one Sextus (145) also\nassigns to Speusippus; it also recalls discussions in Aristotle (e.g.\nMetaphysics VII 15) and the end of Plato’s\nTheaetetus. An ‘epistemonic logos’ is the sort of\naccount that carries knowledge with it. \nThe intelligible domain must have included the formal numbers dealt\nwith above, which was also, as mentioned, the domain of mathematics,\nwhile the special place for the heavens accords with the fact that one\nof the items in D.L.’s bibliography is “On Astronomy, 6\nbooks”. \nThis picture seems to square with Aristotle’s exempting Xenocrates\nfrom the charge, leveled against Speusippus, of producing a\ndiscontinuous universe, and with Theophrastus’ comment to the effect\nthat Xenocrates’ universe encompassed everything. \nHere again we encounter Xenocrates the theologian: Sextus tells us\n(149) that Xenocrates associated the three fates with his three groups\nof substances: Atropos with the intelligible ones, Clotho with the\nperceptible ones, and Lachesis with the believable ones. This sounds a\nXenocratean touch: it connects with the interpretation of Plato (see\nRepublic X 620d–e) and takes mythology very\nseriously. \nHere we are very much in the dark: we have only disconnected snippets\nto consider. \nAristotle names Xenocrates in the Topics in connection with\ntwo ethical views: at II 6. 112a37–38 he ascribes to him the\nview that a happy man is one with a good soul, along with (perhaps)\nthe claim that one’s soul is one’s daimon, whatever that\nmeans; at VII 1. 152a7–9 he ascribes to him an argument to the\neffect that the good life and the happy life are the same, employing\nas premises the claims that the good life and the happy life are both\nthe most choosable (a little later, in 152a26–30, Aristotle\nobjects to this argument). \nPlutarch claims (De communibus notitiis adversus Stoicos\n1069e–f) that Xenocrates made happiness turn on living in\naccordance with nature; since this may derive from Antiochus of\nAscalon, whose project it was to assimilate the Academy to Stoicism,\nit is suspect. Clement (Stromateis II 22) ascribes to him the\nview that happiness is the possession of one’s own excellence in the\nsoul. This view bears a family resemblance to Aristotle’s (NE\nI 7. 1098a16–17, 9. 1099b26). The negative emphasis in\nXenocrates’ evaluation of philosophical activity as “stopping\nthe disturbance of the affairs of life” ([Galen], Historia\nphilosophiae 8, in Diels 1879 605.7–8) sounds like a step\nin the direction of the Hellenistic goal of undisturbedness.","contact.mail":"rmdancy@fsu.edu","contact.domain":"fsu.edu"}]
