The nebulous core shared by all\ncosmopolitan views is the idea that all human beings, regardless of\ntheir political affiliation, are (or can and should be) citizens in a\nsingle community. Different versions of cosmopolitanism envision this\ncommunity in different ways, some focusing on political institutions,\nothers on moral norms or relationships, and still others focusing on\nshared markets or forms of cultural expression. In most versions of\ncosmopolitanism, the universal community of world citizens functions\nas a positive ideal to be cultivated, but a few versions exist in\nwhich it serves primarily as a ground for denying the existence of\nspecial obligations to local forms of political\norganizations. Versions of cosmopolitanism also vary depending on the\nnotion of citizenship they employ, including whether they use the\nnotion of ‘world citizenship’ literally or metaphorically. The\nphilosophical interest in cosmopolitanism lies in its challenge to\ncommonly recognized attachments to fellow-citizens, the local state,\nparochially shared cultures, and the like.\n\n\n\nThe political culture idealized in the writings of Plato and\nAristotle is not cosmopolitan. In this culture, a man identifies\nhimself first and foremost as a citizen of a particular polis or city,\nand in doing so, he signals which institutions and which body of people\nhold his allegiance. He would then be counted on for help in defending\nthe city from attacks, sustaining its institutions of justice, and\ncontributing to its common good. In this way, his own pursuit of a good\nlife is inextricably bound to the fate of the city and to the similar\npursuit carried out by other inhabitants of the city. By contrast, the\ngood person would not be expected to share with or serve any foreigners\nwho live outside the city. Any cosmopolitan expectations on a good\nAthenian extended only to concern for those foreigners who happen to\nreside in Athens. \n\nIt would, however, be wrong to assume that Classical Greek thought\nwas uniformly anti-cosmopolitan. Actively excluding foreigners\nfrom any ethical consideration or actively targeting foreigners for\nmistreatment goes one step beyond focusing one’s service and\nconcern on compatriots, and in fact, the targeting of\n‘barbarians’ is historically linked with the rise of\npanhellenism and not with the more narrow emphasis on the polis. It\nwould be more accurate to call the Classical emphasis on the polis\nuncosmopolitan. \n\nYet even as Plato and Aristotle were writing, other Greeks were\nissuing cosmopolitan challenges. Perhaps the most obvious challenges\ncame from the traveling intellectuals who insisted on the contrast\nbetween the conventional ties of politics and the natural ties of\nhumanity. Notice, for example, the way Plato has the Sophist Hippias\naddress the motley crew of Athenians and foreigners present at Callias’\nhouse in Plato’s Protagoras (337c7–d3): \n\nSocrates, too, it can be argued, was sensitive to this more\ncosmopolitan identification with human beings as such. At least as\nPlato characterizes him, Socrates avoids traditional political\nengagement as much as he can, in favor of an extraordinary career of\nexamining himself and others, and he insists that these examinations\nare both genuinely political (Gorg 521d6–8) and extended to\nall, Athenians and foreigners alike (Apol 23b4–6, 30a3–7; cf. Eu. 3d5–9). Of course,\nSocrates chose not to travel widely, but this decision could well have\nbeen consistent with cosmopolitan ideals, for he may have thought that\nhis best bet for serving human beings generally lay in staying at\nhome, on account, ironically, of Athens’ superior freedom of speech\n(Gorg 461e1–3; cf. Apol 37c5–e2 and Meno\n80b4–7). Whether Socrates was self-consciously cosmopolitan in this\nway or not, there is no doubt that his ideas accelerated the\ndevelopment of cosmopolitanism and that he was in later antiquity\nembraced as a citizen of the world. \n\nIn fact, the first philosopher in\nthe West to give perfectly explicit expression to cosmopolitanism was\nthe Socratically inspired Cynic Diogenes in the fourth century BCE. It\nis said that “when he was asked where he came from, he replied,\n‘I am a citizen of the world\n[kosmopolitês]’” (Diogenes Laertius VI 63).\nBy identifying himself not as a citizen of Sinope but as a citizen of\nthe world, Diogenes apparently refused to agree that he owed special\nservice to Sinope and the Sinopeans. So understood, ‘I am a\ncitizen of the cosmos’ is a negative claim, and we might wonder\nif there is any positive content to the Cynic’s world citizenship. The\nmost natural suggestion would be that a world citizen should serve the\nworld-state, helping to bring it about in order to enable the later\nwork of sustaining its institutions and contributing to its common\ngood. But the historical record does not suggest that Diogenes the\nCynic favored the introduction of a world-state. In fact, the\nhistorical record does not unambiguously provide Diogenes any positive\ncommitments that we can readily understand as cosmopolitan. The best\nwe can do to find positive cosmopolitanism in Diogenes is to insist\nthat the whole Cynic way of life is supposed to be cosmopolitan: by\nliving in accordance with nature and rejecting what is conventional,\nthe Cynic sets an example of high-minded virtue for all other human\nbeings. \n\nA fuller exploration of positively committed philosophical\ncosmopolitanism arrives only with the Socratizing and Cynic-influenced\nStoics of the third century CE. These Stoics are fond of saying that\nthe cosmos is, as it were, a polis, because the cosmos is put in\nperfect order by law, which is right reason. They also embrace the\nnegative implication of their high standards: \nconventional poleis do not, strictly speaking, deserve the name, and human beings who are not wise and virtuous do not count as citizens of the cosmos. But\nthe Stoics do not believe that living in agreement with the cosmos –\nas a (virtuous) citizen of the cosmos – requires maintaining critical distance\nfrom conventional poleis. Rather, as the traces of Chrysippus’ On\nLives make clear, the Stoics believe that goodness requires\nserving other human beings as best one can,\nthat serving all human beings equally well is impossible, and that the\nbest service one can give typically requires political engagement. Of\ncourse, the Stoics recognize that political engagement will not be\npossible for everyone, and that some people will best be able to help\nother human beings as private teachers of virtue rather than as\npoliticians. But in no case, the Stoics insist, is consideration of\npolitical engagement to be limited to one’s own polis. The motivating\nidea is, after all, to help human beings as such, and sometimes the\nbest way to do that is to serve as a teacher or as a political advisor\nin some foreign place. In this fashion, the Stoics introduce clear,\npractical content to their metaphor of the cosmopolis: a cosmopolitan\nconsiders moving away in order to serve, whereas a non-cosmopolitan\ndoes not. \n\nThis content admits of a strict and a more moderate interpretation.\nOn the strict view, when one considers whether to emigrate, one\nrecognizes prima facie no special or stronger reason to serve\ncompatriots than to serve a set of human beings abroad. On the moderate\nview, one does introduce into one’s deliberations extra reason to serve\ncompatriots, although one might still, all things considered, make the\nbest choice by emigrating. The evidence does not permit a decisive\nattribution of one or the other of these interpretations to any of the\nearliest Stoics. But if we think that Chrysippus was deeply\nattracted to the Cynics’ rejection of what is merely conventional, then\nwe will find it easy to think of him as a strict\ncosmopolitan. \n\nThings are a bit different for at least some of the Stoics at Rome.\nOn the one hand, the cosmopolis becomes less demanding. Whereas\nChrysippus limits citizenship in the cosmos to those who in fact live\nin agreement with the cosmos and its law, Roman Stoics extend\ncitizenship to all human beings by virtue of their rationality. On the\nother hand, local citizenship becomes more demanding. There is no\ndoubt that the Stoicism of Cicero’s De Officiis or of\nSeneca’s varied corpus explicitly acknowledges obligations to\nRome in addition to obligations to the cosmos. This is a moderate Stoic cosmopolitanism, and empire made the\ndoctrine very easy for many Romans by identifying the Roman\npatria with the cosmopolis itself. But neither imperialism\nnor a literal interpretation of world citizenship is required for the\nphilosophical point. The maximally committed cosmopolitan looks around\nto determine whom he can best help and how, knowing full well that he\ncannot help all people in just the same way, and his decision to help\nsome people far more than others is justified by cosmopolitan lights\nif it is the best he can do to help human beings as such. \n\nStoic cosmopolitanism in its various guises was enormously persuasive\nthroughout the Greco-Roman world. In part, this success can be\nexplained by noting how cosmopolitan the world at that time was.\nAlexander the Great’s conquests and the subsequent division of his\nempire into successor kingdoms sapped local cities of much of their\ntraditional authority and fostered increased contacts between cities,\nand later, the rise of the Roman Empire united the whole of the\nMediterranean under one political power. But it is wrong to say what\nhas frequently been said, that cosmopolitanism arose as a\nresponse to the fall of the polis or to the rise of the Roman\nempire. First, the polis’ fall has been greatly exaggerated. Under the\nsuccessor kingdoms and even – though to a lesser degree –\nunder Rome, there remained substantial room for important political\nengagement locally. Second, and more decisively, the cosmopolitanism\nthat was so persuasive during the so-called Hellenistic Age and under\nthe Roman Empire was in fact rooted in intellectual developments that\npredate Alexander’s conquests. Still, there is no doubting\nthat the empires under which Stoicism developed and flourished made\nmany people more receptive to the cosmopolitan ideal and thus\ncontributed greatly to the widespread influence of Stoic\ncosmopolitanism. \n\nNowhere was Stoic cosmopolitanism itself more influential than in\nearly Christianity. Early Christians took the later Stoic recognition\nof two cities as independent sources of obligation and added a twist.\nFor the Stoics, the citizens of the polis and the citizens of\nthe cosmopolis do the same work: both aim to improve the\nlives of the citizens. The Christians respond to a different call:\n“Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and\nunto God the things that are God’s” (Matthew 22:21). On this\nview, the local city may have divine authority (John 19:11;\ncf. Romans 13:1,4,7), but the most important work for human\ngoodness is removed from traditional politics, set aside in a sphere in\nwhich people of all nations can become “fellow-citizens with the\nsaints” (Ephesians 2:20). \n\nThis development has two important and long-lasting consequences,\nwhich are canonized by Augustine. First, the cosmopolis again becomes a\ncommunity for certain people only. Augustine makes this point most\nexplicitly by limiting the citizenship in the city of God to those who\nlove God. All others are relegated to the inferior – though still\nuniversal – earthly city by their love of self. These two cities of\nthe world, which are doomed to coexist intertwined until the Final\nJudgment, divide the world’s inhabitants. Second, the work of politics\nis severed from the task of building good human lives, lives of\nrighteousness and justice. While Augustine can stress that this allows\ncitizens in the city of God to obey local laws concerning “the\nnecessaries for the maintenance of life,” he must also\nacknowledge that it sets up a potential conflict over the laws of\nreligion and the concerns of righteousness and justice (e.g.,\nCivitas Dei XIX 17). \n\nFor hundreds of years to come, debates in political philosophy would\nsurround the relation between ‘temporal’ political\nauthority and the ‘eternal Church.’ But emphasis on the\ncosmopolitan aspect of the Church waned, despite its ideal of a\nreligious community comprising all humans. In a nutshell, the debate\nnow opposed the secular and the religious, and not the local and the\ncosmopolitan. To be sure, this debate often had cosmopolitan\nramifications, which are clear enough in Dante Alighieri’s plea for a\nuniversal monarchy in De Monarchia (ca. 1314).  But his case\ndraws from Aristotle and Roman history, not explicitly from the ideal\nof a cosmopolis or of world citizenship, and he remains deeply\nconcerned to adjudicate between the pope and the Holy Roman Emperor.\n \n\nCosmopolitanism slowly began to come to the fore again with the\nrenewed study of more ancient texts, but during the humanist era\ncosmopolitanism still remained the exception. Despite the fact that\nancient cosmopolitan sources were well-known and that many humanists\nemphasized the essential unity of all religions, they did not develop\nthis idea in cosmopolitan terms. A few authors, however, most notably\nErasmus of Rotterdam, explicitly drew on ancient cosmopolitanism to\nadvocate the ideal of a world-wide peace. Emphasizing the unity of\nhumankind over its division into different states and peoples, by\narguing that humans are destined by Nature to be sociable and live in\nharmony, Erasmus pleaded for national and religious tolerance and\nregarded like-minded people as his compatriots (Querela\nPacis). \n\nEarly modern natural law theory might seem a likely candidate for\nspawning philosophical cosmopolitanism. Its secularizing tendencies and\nthe widespread individualist view among its defenders that all humans\nshare certain fundamental characteristics would seem to suggest a point\nof unification for humankind as a whole. However, according to many\nearly modern theorists, what all individuals share is a fundamental\nstriving for self-preservation, and the universality of this striving\ndoes not amount to a fundamental bond that unites (or should unite) all\nhumans in a universal community. \n\nStill, there are two factors that do sometimes push modern natural\nlaw theory in a cosmopolitan direction.  First, some\nnatural law theorists assume that nature implanted in humans, in\naddition to the tendency to self-preservation, also a\nfellow-feeling, a form of sociability that unites all humans at a\nfundamental level into a kind of world community. The appeal to such a\nshared human bond was very thin, however, and by no means does it\nnecessarily lead to cosmopolitanism. In fact, the very notion of a\nnatural sociability was sometimes used instead to legitimate war\nagainst peoples elsewhere in the world who were said to have violated\nthis common bond in an ‘unnatural’ way, or who were easily\nsaid to have placed themselves outside of the domain of common human\nmorality by their ‘barbaric’ customs. Second, early modern\nnatural law theory was often connected with social contract theory, and\nalthough most social contract theorists worked out their views mostly,\nif not solely, for the level of the state and not for that of\ninternational relations, the very idea behind social contract theory\nlends itself for application to this second level. Grotius, Pufendorf,\nand others did draw out these implications and thereby laid the\nfoundation for international law. Grotius envisioned a “great\nsociety of states” that is bound by a “law of\nnations” that holds “between all states” (De Iure\nBelli ac Paci, 1625, Prolegomena par. 17; Pufendorf, De Iure\nNaturae et Gentium, 1672). \n\nThe historical context of the philosophical resurgence of\ncosmopolitanism during the Enlightenment is made up of many factors:\nThe increasing rise of capitalism and world-wide trade and its\ntheoretical reflections; the reality of ever expanding empires whose\nreach extended across the globe; the voyages around the world and the\nanthropological so-called ‘discoveries’ facilitated through\nthese; the renewed interest in Hellenistic philosophy; and the\nemergence of a notion of human rights and a philosophical focus on\nhuman reason. Many intellectuals of the time regarded their membership\nin the transnational ‘republic of letters’ as more\nsignificant than their membership in the particular political states\nthey found themselves in, all the more so because their relationship\nwith their government was often strained because of censorship issues.\nThis prepared them to think in terms other than those of states and\npeoples and adopt a cosmopolitan perspective. Under the influence of\nthe American Revolution, and especially during the first years of the\nFrench Revolution, cosmopolitanism received its strongest impulse. The\n1789 declaration of ‘human’ rights had grown out of\ncosmopolitan modes of thinking and reinforced them in turn. \n\nIn the eighteenth century, the terms ‘cosmopolitanism’\nand ‘world citizenship’ were often used not as labels for\ndeterminate philosophical theories, but rather to indicate an attitude\nof open-mindedness and impartiality. A cosmopolitan was someone who was\nnot subservient to a particular religious or political authority,\nsomeone who was not biased by particular loyalties or cultural\nprejudice. Furthermore, the term was sometimes used to indicate a\nperson who led an urbane life-style, or who was fond of traveling,\ncherished a network of international contacts, or felt at home\neverywhere. In this sense the Encyclopédie mentioned that\n‘cosmopolitan’ was often used to signify a “man of no\nfixed abode, or a man who is nowhere a stranger.” Though\nphilosophical authors such as Montesquieu, Voltaire, Diderot, Addison,\nHume, and Jefferson identified themselves as cosmopolitans in one or\nmore of these senses, these usages are not of much philosophical\ninterest. \n\nEspecially in the second half of the century, however, the term was\nincreasingly also used to indicate particular philosophical\nconvictions. Some authors revived the Cynic tradition. Fougeret de\nMontbron in his 1753 autobiographical report, Le Cosmopolite,\ncalls himself a cosmopolitan, describes how he travels everywhere\nwithout being committed to anywhere, declaring “All the countries\nare the same to me” and “[I am] changing my places of\nresidence according to my whim” (p. 130). \n\nDespite the fact that only a few authors committed\nthemselves to this kind of cosmopolitanism, this was the version that\ncritics of cosmopolitanism took as their target. For example, Rousseau\ncomplains that cosmopolitans “boast that they love everyone\n[tout le monde, which also means ‘the whole\nworld’], to have the right to love no one” (Geneva\nManuscript version of The Social Contract, 158). Johann Georg\nSchlosser, in the critical poem ‘Der Kosmopolit’ writes,\n“It is better to be proud of one’s nation than to have\nnone,” obviously assuming that cosmopolitanism implies the\nlatter. \n\nYet most eighteenth-century defenders of cosmopolitanism did not\nrecognize their own view in these critical descriptions. They\nunderstood cosmopolitanism not as a form of ultra-individualism, but\nrather, drawing on the Stoic tradition, as implying the positive moral\nideal of a universal human community, and they did not regard this\nideal as inimical to more particular attachments. \nSome, like the German author Christoph Martin Wieland, stayed quite\nclose to Stoic views. Others developed a cosmopolitan moral theory that\nwas distinctively new. According to Kant, all rational beings are\nmembers in a single moral community. They are analogous to citizens in\nthe political (republican) sense in that they share the characteristics\nof freedom, equality, and independence, and that they live under their own laws. Their common laws, however, are the laws of morality, grounded\nin reason. Early utilitarian cosmopolitans like Jeremy Bentham, by\ncontrast, defended their cosmopolitanism by pointing to the\n“common and equal utility of all nations.” Moral\ncosmopolitanism could be grounded in human reason, or in some other\ncharacteristic universally shared among humans (and in some cases other\nkinds of beings) such as the capacity to experience pleasure or pain, a\nmoral sense, or the aesthetic imagination. Moral cosmopolitans regarded\nall humans as ‘brothers’ – an analogy with which they aimed to indicate the fundamental\nequality of rank of all humans, which precluded slavery, colonial\nexploitation, feudal hierarchy, and tutelage of various sorts. As the term ‘brothers’ indicates, however, this does not mean that their own thought was always free from bias and inconsistency. Indeed, numerous authors combined their moral cosmopolitanism with a defense of the superiority of men over women, or that of “whites” over other “races.” A notable example is Kant, who defended European colonialism before he became very critical of it in the mid 1790s (Kleingeld 2014), and who never gave up the view that women were inferior to men in morally relevant respects. \n\nSome cosmopolitans developed their view into a political theory\nabout international relations. The most radical of eighteenth-century\npolitical cosmopolitans was no doubt Anacharsis Cloots (Jean-Baptiste\ndu Val-de-Grace, baron de Cloots, 1755–1794). Cloots advocated the\nabolition of all existing states and the establishment of a single\nworld state under which all human individuals would be directly\nsubsumed. His arguments drew first of all on the general structure of\nsocial contract theory. If it is in the general interest for everyone\nto submit to the authority of a state that enforces laws that provide\nsecurity, then this argument applies world-wide and justifies the\nestablishment of a world-wide “republic of united\nindividuals,” not a plurality of states that find themselves in\nthe state of nature vis-à-vis each other. Second, he argues that\nsovereignty should reside with the people, and that the concept of\nsovereignty itself, because it involves indivisibility, implies that\nthere can be but one sovereign body in the world, namely, the human\nrace as a whole (La république universelle ou adresse aux\ntyrannicides, 1792; Bases constitutionelles de la\nrépublique du genre humain, 1793). Most other political cosmopolitans did not go as far as\nCloots. Immanuel Kant, most famously, advocated a much weaker form of\ninternational legal order, namely, that of a ‘league of\nnations.’ In Toward Perpetual Peace (1795) Kant argues\nthat true and world-wide peace is possible only when states organize\nthemselves internally according to ‘republican’\nprinciples, when they organize themselves externally in a voluntary\nleague for the sake of keeping peace, and when they respect the human\nrights not only of their citizens but also of foreigners. He argues\nthat the league of states should not have coercive military powers\nbecause that would violate the internal sovereignty of states.  Some critics argued in response that Kant’s position was\ninconsistent, because on their view, the only way to fully overcome\nthe state of nature among states was for the latter to enter into a\nfederative union with coercive powers. The early Fichte transformed\nthe concept of sovereignty in the process, by conceiving it as\nlayered, and this enabled them to argue that states ought to transfer\npart of their sovereignty to the federal level, but only that part\nthat concerns their external relations to other states, while\nretaining the sovereignty of the states concerning their internal\naffairs. Romantic authors, on the other hand, felt that the ideal\nstate should not have to involve coercion at all, and hence also that\nthe cosmopolitan ideal should be that of a world-wide republic of\n‘fraternal’ non-authoritarian republics (the young\nFriedrich Schlegel). Especially the first objection has been repeated ever since, but\nmore recent interpretations have questioned its legitimacy (Kleingeld\n2004, 2012), arguing that Kant can also be read as advocating the\nloose league as a first step on the road toward a federation with\ncoercive powers. Because joining this stronger form of federation\nshould be a voluntary decision on the part of the peoples involved, to\nhonor their political autonomy, the strong federation is not a matter\nof coercive international right. On this interpretation, Kant’s\ndefense of the loose league is much more consistent.  \n\nKant also introduced the concept of “cosmopolitan law,” suggesting a\nthird sphere of public law – in addition to constitutional law\nand international law – in which both states and individuals\nhave rights, and where individuals have these rights as “citizens of\nthe earth” rather than as citizens of particular states. In addition to moral and political forms of cosmopolitanism, there\nemerged an economic form of cosmopolitan theory. The freer trade\nadvocated by eighteenth-century anti-mercantilists, especially Adam\nSmith, was developed further into the ideal of a global free market by\nDietrich Hermann Hegewisch (Kleingeld 2012). His ideal was a world in\nwhich tariffs and other restrictions on foreign trade are abolished, a\nworld in which the market, not the government, takes care of the needs\nof the people. Against mercantilism, he argued that it is more\nadvantageous for everyone involved if a nation imports those goods\nwhich are more expensive to produce domestically, and that the\nabolition of protectionism would benefit everyone. If other states\nwere to gain from their exports, they would reach a higher standard of\nliving and become even better trading partners, because they could\nthen import more, too. Moreover, on Hegewisch’s view, after trade will\nhave been liberalized world-wide, the importance of national\ngovernments will diminish dramatically. As national governments are\nmostly focused on the national economy and defense, he argued, their\nfuture role will be at most auxiliary. The freer the global market\nbecomes, the more the role of the states will become negligible. Enlightenment cosmopolitanism continued to be a source of debate in\nthe subsequent two centuries. First, in the nineteenth century,\neconomic globalization provoked fierce reactions. Marx and Engels tag\ncosmopolitanism as an ideological reflection of capitalism. They\nregard market capitalism as inherently expansive, breaking the bounds\nof the nation-state system, as evidenced by the fact that production\nand consumption had become attuned to faraway lands. In their hands,\nthe word ‘cosmopolitan’ is tied to the effects of\ncapitalist globalization, including especially the bourgeois ideology\nwhich legitimizes ‘free’ trade in terms of the freedom\nof individuals and mutual benefit, although this very capitalist order\nis the cause of the misery of millions, indeed the cause of the very\nexistence of the proletariat. At the same time, however, Marx and\nEngels also hold that the proletariat in every country shares\nessential features and has common interests, and the Communist\nmovement aims to convince proletarians everywhere of these common\ninterests. Most famously, the Communist Manifesto ends with\nthe call, “Proletarians of all countries, unite!” This,\ncombined with the ideal of the class-less society and the expected\nwithering away of the states after the revolution, implies a form of\ncosmopolitanism of its own. \n\nDebates about global capitalism and about an international workers’\nmovement have persisted. Frequently economic cosmopolitanism can be\nfound in the advocacy of open markets, in the tradition from Adam Smith\nto Friedrich von Hayek and Milton Friedman. Communist versions of\ncosmopolitanism also developed further, although the Leninist-Stalinist\ntradition kept using ‘cosmopolitan’ itself as a derogatory\nterm. \n\nThe second inheritance from eighteenth century cosmopolitanism is\nfound in the two centuries’ worth of attempts to create peace. It has\noften been noted that there are parallels between Kant’s peace\nproposal in Toward Perpetual Peace and the structure of the\nLeague of Nations as it existed in the early part of the 20th century\nas well as the structure of the current United Nations, although it\nshould also be pointed out that essential features of Kant’s plan were\nnot implemented, such as the abolition of standing armies. After the end of the cold war, discussion about the most appropriate world order to promote global peace resurged, just as it did after the first and second world wars. \n\nThe International Criminal Court should be mentioned here as an\ninnovative form of cosmopolitanism, going much beyond Kant’s\nconception of ‘cosmopolitan law.’ The ICC itself\nrepresents an extension of the long trend, in international law, to do\naway with the principle of the absolute subjection of individuals to\nthe state and strengthen the status of individuals. Individuals are\nnow the bearers of certain rights under international law, and they\ncan be held responsible for crimes under international law in ways\nthat cut through the shield of state sovereignty. \n\nThird, moral philosophers and moralists in the wake of\neighteenth-century cosmopolitanisms have insisted that we human beings\nhave a duty to aid fellow humans in need, regardless of their\ncitizenship status. There is a history of international relief efforts\n(International Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, famine relief\norganizations, and the like) in the name of the reduction of human\nsuffering and without regard to the nationality of those affected. \n\nIn addition, because cosmopolitan duty is not restricted to duties of\nbeneficence but also requires justice and respect, cosmopolitan values\nand principles have often been invoked as a motivation to oppose\nslavery and apartheid, and to advocate the emancipation of women. \n\nMost past cosmopolitan authors did not fully live up to the literal\ninterpretation of their cosmopolitan theories, and one can find\nmisogynist, racist, nationalist, sectarian, or class-based biases and\ninconsistencies in their accounts. These shortcomings have often been\nused as arguments against cosmopolitanism, but they are not as easily\nused for that purpose as it may seem. Because the universalist\npotential in the discourse of ‘world citizenship’ can\nitself be used as a basis for exposing these shortcomings as\nproblematic, one should say that they stem from too little, rather than\ntoo much, cosmopolitanism. \n\nEven this brief glance backwards reveals a wide variety of views that\ncan be called cosmopolitan. Every cosmopolitan argues for some\ncommunity among all human beings, regardless of social and political\naffiliation. For some, what should be shared is simply moral\ncommunity, which means only that living a good human life requires\nserving the universal community by helping human beings as such,\nperhaps by promoting the realization of justice and the guarantee of\nhuman rights.  Others conceptualize the universal community in terms\nof political institutions to be shared by all, in terms of cultural\nexpressions that can be shared or appreciated by all, or in terms of\neconomic markets that should be open to all.  \n\nThe most common cosmopolitanism – moral cosmopolitanism\n– does not always call itself such. But just as ancient\ncosmopolitanism was fundamentally a ‘moral’ commitment to\nhelping human beings as such, much contemporary moral philosophy\ninsists on the duty to aid foreigners who are starving or otherwise\nsuffering, or at least on the duty to respect and promote basic human\nrights and justice.  One can here distinguish between strict and\nmoderate forms of cosmopolitanism. The strict cosmopolitans\nin this sphere operate sometimes from utilitarian assumptions (e.g.,\nSinger, Unger), sometimes from Kantian assumptions (e.g., O’Neill),\nand sometimes from more ancient assumptions (e.g., Nussbaum), but\nalways with the claim that the duty to provide aid neither gets\nweighed against any extra duty to help locals or compatriots nor\nincreases in strength when locals or compatriots are in\nquestion. Among these strict cosmopolitans some will say that it is\npermissible, at least in some situations, to concentrate one’s\ncharitable efforts on one’s compatriots, while others deny this\n– their position will depend on the details of their moral\ntheory. Other philosophers whom we may call moderate\ncosmopolitans (including, e.g., Scheffler) acknowledge the\ncosmopolitan scope of a duty to provide aid, but insist that we also\nhave special duties to compatriots. Among the moderate cosmopolitans,\nmany further distinctions can be drawn, depending on the reasons that\nare admitted for recognizing special responsibilities to compatriots\nand depending on how the special responsibilities are balanced with\nthe cosmopolitan duties to human beings generally. \n\nMoral cosmopolitanism has sometimes led to political\ncosmopolitanism. Again, we can draw useful distinctions among the\npolitical cosmopolitans. Some advocate a centralized world state, some\nfavor a federal system with a comprehensive global body of limited\ncoercive power, some would prefer international political institutions\nthat are limited in scope and focus on particular concerns (e.g., war\ncrimes, environmental preservation), and some defend a different\nalternative altogether. Prominent philosophical discussions of\ninternational political arrangements have recently clustered around\nthe heirs of Kant (e.g., Habermas, Rawls, Beitz, and Pogge) and around\nadvocates of ‘cosmopolitan democracy’ (e.g., Held) or\n‘republican cosmopolitanism’ (Bohman 2001, Laborde 2010, Pettit 2010, 2016). \n\nA number of theorists have objected to the focus, in much of the\ndebate over political cosmopolitanism, on the role of states. In their\nview, a genuinely cosmopolitan theory should address the needs and\ninterests of human individuals directly – as world\ncitizens – instead of indirectly, as state citizens, that is via\ntheir membership in particular states. What is needed instead is a\ntheory that focuses not merely on the moral duties of individuals or\non the political relations among states, but on the justice of social\ninstitutions world-wide and the measures required to attain it. This\n‘cosmopolitan’ position in the debate over global\ndistributive justice, is especially critical of what they see as\nJohn Rawls’ privileging of the interests of states over those of\nindividuals, in his Theory of Justice as well as in his\nsubsequent Law of Peoples. In order to establish principles\nof global justice, Rawls should have applied his famous thought\nexperiment of the ‘original position’ at the global level\nof all human individuals, they charge, instead of arguing, as Rawls\ndoes, for a second original position, one that involves\nrepresentatives of all ‘peoples’. The debate between Rawls\nand his cosmopolitan critics points to the issue of the proper role\nand status of states: are they indispensable instruments in the\npursuit of justice (ideally embodying the principle of the democratic\nself-determination of peoples), or are they rather inimical to it,\nbecause they entrench state interests at the expense of individuals in\nneed? \n\nFurthermore, there has been a good deal of debate\nover cultural cosmopolitanism, with disputes over\nmulticulturalism in educational curricula and with resurgent\nnationalisms. The cosmopolitan position in these\ndisputes rejects exclusive attachments to a particular culture. So on\nthe one hand, the cosmopolitan encourages cultural diversity and\nappreciates a multicultural mélange, and on the other hand, the\ncosmopolitan rejects a strong nationalism. In staking out these\nclaims, the cosmopolitan must be wary about very strong ‘rights\nto culture,’ respecting the rights of minority cultures while\nrebuffing the right to unconditional national\nself-determination. Hence, recent advocates of ‘liberal\nnationalism’ (e.g., Margalit and Raz, Tamir) or of the rights of\nminority cultures (e.g., Kymlicka) generally seem to be\nanti-cosmopolitan. But the cosmopolitan’s wariness towards very strong\nrights to culture and towards national self-determination need not be\ngrounded in a wholesale skepticism about the importance of particular\ncultural attachments. Cosmopolitanism can acknowledge the importance\nof (at least some kinds of) cultural attachments for the good human\nlife (at least within certain limits), while denying that this implies\nthat a person’s cultural identity should be defined by any bounded or\nhomogeneous subset of the cultural resources available in the world\n(e.g., Waldron). \n\nEconomic cosmopolitanism is perhaps less often defended\namong philosophers and more often among economists (e.g., Hayek,\nFriedman) and certain politicians, especially in the richer countries\nof this world. It is the view that one ought to cultivate a single\nglobal economic market with free trade and minimal political\ninvolvement. It tends to be criticized rather than advanced by\nphilosophical cosmopolitans, as many of them regard it as at least a\npartial cause of the problem of vast international economic inequality.\nThese debates about the desirability of a fully globalized market have\nintensified in recent years, as a result of the end of the Cold War and\nthe increasing reach of the market economy. \n\nOne of the most common objections to cosmopolitanism attacks a position\nthat is in fact made of straw. Often it is said that cosmopolitanism is\nmeaningless without the context of a world–state or that\ncosmopolitanism necessarily involves the commitment to a world state.\nThese claims are historically uninformed, because cosmopolitanism as a\nconcept arose in the first instance as a metaphor for a way of life and\nnot in literal guise. Ever since, there have been cosmopolitans who do\nnot touch on the issue of international political organization, and of\nthose who do, very few defend the ideal of a world–state. Furthermore,\neven those cosmopolitans who do favor a world-state tend to support\nsomething more sophisticated that cannot be dismissed out of hand, such as a\nthin conception of world government with layered sovereignty.  Another common objection to cosmopolitanism associates it with imperialism, colonialism, and paternalism. Some cosmopolitans, despite taking themselves to be opposed to imperialism, colonialism, and paternalism, are charged with focusing too narrowly on the responsibilities (and perspectives) of the affluent while conceiving of those living in poverty mainly as the passive recipients of their “aid.” Such focus indeed shows little sensitivity to questions of epistemic justice and to the wide range of perspectives that merit being taken seriously (Flikschuh 2017). These charges are often internal to cosmopolitanism, however, as they do not so much call into question the cosmopolitan ideal itself as reject certain limited instantiations of it. Cosmopolitans can and do examine the entitlements of those living in poverty (Caney 2015) and argue in favor of poor-led social movements (Deveaux 2018) and alternative forms of cosmopolitanism “from below” (Bailey 2017). Others point to the relevance, for cosmopolitan theorizing, of poverty-driven labor migration and migrant activism as acts of world citizenship (Caraus and Paris 2018). \n\nThere are, however, serious and philosophically interesting challenges to\ncosmopolitanism itself, and they come in two main forms. The first calls into question\nthe possibility of realizing the cosmopolitan ideal, while the second\nqueries its desirability. We discuss these two challenges to the\ndifferent forms of cosmopolitanism in turn. \n\nIt is often argued that it is impossible to change the current system\nof states and to form a world–state or a global federation of\nstates. This claim is hard to maintain, however, in the face of the\nexistence of the United Nations, the existence of states with more\nthan a billion people of heterogeneous backgrounds, and the experience\nwith the United States and the European Union. So in order to be taken\nseriously, the objection must instead be that it is impossible to form\na good state or federation of that magnitude, i.e., that it\nis impossible to realize or even approximate the cosmopolitan ideal in\na way that makes it worth pursuing and that does not carry prohibitive\nrisks. Here political cosmopolitans disagree among themselves. On one\nend of the spectrum we find those who argue in favor of a strong\nworld-state, on the other end we find the defenders of a loose and\nvoluntary federation, or a different system altogether. \n\nThe defenders of the loose, voluntary and noncoercive federation warn\nthat a world-state easily becomes despotic without there being any\ncompeting power left to break the hold of despotism (Rawls).\nDefenders of the world-state reply that a stronger form of federation,\nor even merger, is the only way to truly exit the state of nature\nbetween states, or the only way to bring about international\ndistributive justice (Nielsen, Cabrera). Other authors have argued that the focus among\nmany political cosmopolitans on only these two alternatives overlooks\na third cosmopolitan position, and that a concern for human rights should lead one to focus\ninstead on institutional reform that disperses sovereignty vertically,\nrather than concentrating it in all-encompassing international\ninstitutions. On this view, peace, democracy, prosperity, and the\nenvironment would be better served by a system in which the political\nallegiance and loyalties of persons are widely dispersed over a number\nof political units of various sizes, without any one unit being\ndominant and thus occupying the traditional role of the state\n(Pogge). \n\nOf the objections brought up by non- or anti-cosmopolitans, two\ndeserve special mention. First, some authors argue that the (partial or\nwhole) surrender of state sovereignty required by the cosmopolitan\nscheme is an undue violation of the principle of the autonomy of states\nor the principle of democratic self-determination of their citizens.\nSecond, so-called ‘realists’ argue that states are in a\nHobbesian state of nature as far as the relations among them are\nconcerned, and that it is as inappropriate as it is futile to subject\nstates to normative constraints. To these objections cosmopolitans have\nvarious kinds of response, ranging from developing their alternative\nnormative theory (e.g., by arguing that global democracy increases\nrather than diminishes the democratic control of individual world\ncitizens) to pointing out, as has been done at least since Grotius,\nthat states have good reasons even on Hobbesian grounds to submit to\ncertain forms of international legal arrangements. \n\nVarious arguments have been used to show that economic cosmopolitanism\nis not a viable option. Marx and later Marxists have argued that\ncapitalism is self-destructive in the long run, because the\nexploitation, alienation, and poverty that it inflicts on the\nproletariat will provoke a world-wide revolution that will bring about\nthe end of capitalism. In the twentieth century, when nationalist\ntendencies proved to be stronger (or in any case more easily mobilized)\nthan international solidarity, and when the position of workers was\nstrengthened to the point of making them unwilling to risk a\nrevolution, this forced the left to reconsider this view.  \n\nCritics of the economic cosmopolitan ideal have also started to\nemphasize another way in which capitalism bears the seeds of its own\ndestruction within itself, namely, insofar as it is said to lead to a\nglobal environmental disaster that might spell the end of the human\nspecies, or in any event the end of capitalism as we know it. The\neffects of excessive consumption (in some parts of the world) and the\nexploitation of nature would make the earth inhospitable to future\nhuman generations. \n\nEven if one does not think that these first two problems are so\nserious as to make economic cosmopolitanism unviable, they can still\nmake it seem undesirable in the eyes of those who are\nconcerned with poverty, environmental destruction, and the impact of climate change. \n\nMoreover, there are several other concerns that lead critics to\nregard economic cosmopolitanism as undesirable. First among these is\nthe lack of effective democratic control by the vast majority of the\nworld’s population, as large multinationals are able to impose demands\non states that are in a weak economic position and their populations,\ndemands that they cannot reasonably refuse to meet, although this does\nnot mean that they meet them fully voluntarily. This concerns, for\nexample, labor conditions or the use of raw materials in developing countries. \n\nSecond, economic cosmopolitans are accused of failing to pay attention\nto a number of probable side-effects of a global free market. In\nparticular, they are criticized for neglecting or downplaying issues\nsuch as (a) the vast inequality of wealth and extreme poverty without\nthere being any reliable mechanism to provide relief, if they reduce\nthe role of political institutions (b) the presupposition of\nlarge-scale migration or re-schooling when jobs disappear in one area\n(the loss of ties to friends and family, language, culture, etc., and\nthe monetary costs of moving or re-tooling), (c) the lack of a\nguarantee that there will be a sufficient supply of living-wage jobs\nfor all world citizens (especially given increasing automation. They\nare similarly accused of failing to take seriously the fact that there\nmight be circumstances under which it would be profitable for some\nstates to be protectionist or wage war, such as wars about markets or\nraw materials and energy (e.g., oil). \n\nAnother version of the criticism that cosmopolitanism is impossible\ntargets the psychological assumptions of moral cosmopolitanism. Here\nit is said that human beings must have stronger attachments toward\nmembers of their own state or nation, and that attempts to disperse\nattachments to fellow-citizens in order to honor a moral community\nwith human beings as such will undermine our psychological\nfunctioning. If this is a viability claim and not simply\na desirability claim, then it must be supposed that moral\ncosmopolitanism would literally leave large numbers of people unable\nto function. So it is claimed that people need a particular sense of\nnational identity in order to be agents, and that a particular sense\nof national identity requires attachment to particular others\nperceived to have a similar identity. But this does not seem to be\ntrue as an empirical generalization. The cosmopolitan does not need to\ndeny that some people do happen to have the need for national\nallegiance, so long as it is true that not all people do; and insofar\nas some people do, the strict cosmopolitan will say that perhaps it\ndoes not need to be that way and that cosmopolitan education might\nlead to a different result. The historical record gives even the\nstrict cosmopolitan some cause for cheer, as human psychology and the\nforms of political organization have proven to be quite plastic.  \n\nIn fact, some cosmopolitans have adopted a developmental psychology\naccording to which patriotism is a step on the way to cosmopolitanism:\nas human individuals mature they develop ever wider loyalties and\nallegiances, starting with attachments to their caregivers and ending\nwith allegiance to humanity at large. These different attachments are\nnot necessarily in competition with each other. Just as loyalty to\none’s family need not be an obstacle for state citizens, so loyalty to\none’s state need not be a problem for cosmopolitans. Thus,\ncosmopolitanism is regarded as an extension of a developmental process\nthat also includes the development of patriotism. This claim is just\nas much in need of empirical support, however, as the opposite claim\ndiscussed in the previous paragraph. \n\nOften, though, the critic’s arguments about psychological\npossibility are actually run together with desirability\nclaims. The critic says that the elimination of a special motivating\nattachment to fellow-citizens is not possible, but the critic means\nthat the elimination of special motivating attachments to\nfellow-citizens will make a certain desirable form of political life\nimpossible. To respond to this sort of argument, the cosmopolitan has\ntwo routes open. First, she can deny the claim itself. Perhaps the\nviability of politics as usual depends not upon certain beliefs that\nfellow-citizens deserve more of one’s service, but upon commitments to\nthe polity itself. If strictly cosmopolitan patriotism is a\npossibility, it lives in a commitment to a universal set of principles\nembodied in a particular political constitution and a particular set of\npolitical institutions. If such commitment is enough for desirable\npolitics, then the anti-cosmopolitan is disarmed. But second, the\ncosmopolitan can of course also deny the value of the form of political\nlife that is posited as desirable. At this point, moral commitments run\nover into a discussion of political theory. \n\nOccasionally it is said that cosmopolitans are treasonous or at least\nunreliable citizens. But many recognizably cosmopolitan theses (that\nis, the moderate ones) are consistent with loyalty to fellow-citizens,\nand even the strictest cosmopolitan can justify some forms of service\nto fellow-citizens when they are an optimal way to promote justice or\nto do good for human beings (who might happen to be\nfellow-citizens). \n\nThis last criticism can be developed further, however, and tailored\nspecifically to target the strict cosmopolitan. If the strict\ncosmopolitan can justify only some forms of service to fellow-citizens,\nunder some conditions, it might be said that she is blind to other\nmorally required forms or conditions of service to fellow-citizens. At\nthis point, the critic offers reasons why a person has special\nobligations to compatriots, which are missed by the strict\ncosmopolitan. Many critics who introduce these reasons are themselves\nmoderate cosmopolitans, wishing to demonstrate that there are special\nobligations to fellow-citizens in addition to general duties to the\ncommunity of all human beings. But if these reasons are demanding\nenough, then there may be no room left for any community with all human\nbeings, and so these objections to strict cosmopolitanism can also\nprovide some impetus toward an anti-cosmopolitan stance. Because there\nare several such reasons that are frequently proposed, there are, in\neffect, several objections to the strictly cosmopolitan position, and\nthey should be considered one-by-one. \n\nThe first narrow objection to strict cosmopolitanism is that it\nneglects the obligations of reciprocity. According to this argument, we\nhave obligations to give benefits in return for benefits received, and\nwe receive benefits from our fellow-citizens. The best strictly\ncosmopolitan response to this argument will insist on a distinction\nbetween the state and fellow-citizens and will question exactly who\nprovides which benefits and what is owed in return. On grounds of\nreciprocity the state may be owed certain things – cooperative\nobedience – and these things may in fact generally benefit\nfellow-citizens. But the state is not owed these things\nbecause one owes the fellow-citizens benefits. One does not\nappropriately signal gratitude for benefits received from the state by,\nsay, giving more to local charities than to charities abroad because\ncharity like this does not address the full agent responsible for the\nbenefits one has received, and does not even seem to be the sort of\nthing that is commensurate with the benefits received. In assessing\nthis exchange of arguments, there are some significantly difficult\nquestions to answer concerning exactly how the receipt of benefits\nobliges one to make a return. \n\nA second objection to strict moral cosmopolitanism gives contractarian\ngrounds for our obligations to fellow-citizens. Because actual\nagreements to prioritize fellow-citizens as beneficiaries are\ndifficult to find, the contractarians generally rely upon an implicit\nagreement that expresses the interests or values of the\nfellow-citizens themselves. So the contractarian argument turns on\nidentifying interests or values that obligate fellow-citizens to\nbenefit each other. Perhaps, then, it will be argued that citizens\nhave deep interests in what a successful civil society and state can\noffer them, and that these interests commit the citizens to an\nimplicit agreement to benefit fellow-citizens. The strict cosmopolitan\nwill reply to such an argument with skepticism about what is required\nfor the civil society. Why is more than cooperative obedience required\nby our interests in what a successful state and civil society can\nprovide?  Surely some citizens have to dedicate themselves to working\non behalf of this particular society, but why can they not do so on\nthe grounds that this is the best way to benefit human beings as such?\nPerhaps an intermediate position here is the (Kantian) view that it is\nmorally necessary to establish just democratic states and that just\ndemocratic states need some special commitment on the part of their\ncitizens in order to function as democracies, a special commitment\nthat goes beyond mere cooperative obedience but that can still be\ndefended in universalist cosmopolitan terms. For given that\ndemocracies require this special commitment as a condition of their\npossibility, it would be incoherent to promote justice in general by\npromoting just democracies while rejecting, as a matter of principle,\nthat which is required for just democracies to function. \n\nThe final argument for recognizing obligations to benefit\nfellow-citizens appeals to what David Miller has called\n‘relational facts.’ Here the general thought is that\ncertain relationships are constituted by reciprocal obligations: one\ncannot be a friend or a brother without having certain\nfriendship-obligations or sibling-obligations, respectively. If\nfellow-citizenship is like these other relations, then we would seem to\nhave special obligations to fellow-citizens. But this argument, which\ncan be found in Cicero’s De Officiis, depends upon our\nintuitions that fellow-citizenship is like friendship or brotherhood\nand that friendship and brotherhood do come with special obligations,\nand both intuitions require more argument. Frequently, these arguments\nappeal to alleged facts about human nature or about human psychology,\nbut these appeals generally raise still further questions. \n\nIn sum, a range of interesting and difficult philosophical issues is\nraised by the disputes between cosmopolitans of various stripes and\ntheir critics. As the world becomes a smaller place through increased\nsocial, political, and economic contacts, these disputes and the issues\nthey raise will only become more pressing.","contact.mail":"pauline.kleingeld@rug.nl","contact.domain":"rug.nl"},{"date.published":"2002-02-23","date.changed":"2019-10-17","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cosmopolitanism/","author1":"Pauline Kleingeld","author1.info":"https://sites.google.com/view/ericbrownphilosophy/eric-brown","entry":"cosmopolitanism","body.text":"\n\n\n\nThe word ‘cosmopolitan’, which derives from the Greek\nword kosmopolitēs (‘citizen of the world’),\nhas been used to describe a wide variety of important views in moral\nand socio-political philosophy. The nebulous core shared by all\ncosmopolitan views is the idea that all human beings, regardless of\ntheir political affiliation, are (or can and should be) citizens in a\nsingle community. Different versions of cosmopolitanism envision this\ncommunity in different ways, some focusing on political institutions,\nothers on moral norms or relationships, and still others focusing on\nshared markets or forms of cultural expression. In most versions of\ncosmopolitanism, the universal community of world citizens functions\nas a positive ideal to be cultivated, but a few versions exist in\nwhich it serves primarily as a ground for denying the existence of\nspecial obligations to local forms of political\norganizations. Versions of cosmopolitanism also vary depending on the\nnotion of citizenship they employ, including whether they use the\nnotion of ‘world citizenship’ literally or metaphorically. The\nphilosophical interest in cosmopolitanism lies in its challenge to\ncommonly recognized attachments to fellow-citizens, the local state,\nparochially shared cultures, and the like.\n\n\n\nThe political culture idealized in the writings of Plato and\nAristotle is not cosmopolitan. In this culture, a man identifies\nhimself first and foremost as a citizen of a particular polis or city,\nand in doing so, he signals which institutions and which body of people\nhold his allegiance. He would then be counted on for help in defending\nthe city from attacks, sustaining its institutions of justice, and\ncontributing to its common good. In this way, his own pursuit of a good\nlife is inextricably bound to the fate of the city and to the similar\npursuit carried out by other inhabitants of the city. By contrast, the\ngood person would not be expected to share with or serve any foreigners\nwho live outside the city. Any cosmopolitan expectations on a good\nAthenian extended only to concern for those foreigners who happen to\nreside in Athens. \n\nIt would, however, be wrong to assume that Classical Greek thought\nwas uniformly anti-cosmopolitan. Actively excluding foreigners\nfrom any ethical consideration or actively targeting foreigners for\nmistreatment goes one step beyond focusing one’s service and\nconcern on compatriots, and in fact, the targeting of\n‘barbarians’ is historically linked with the rise of\npanhellenism and not with the more narrow emphasis on the polis. It\nwould be more accurate to call the Classical emphasis on the polis\nuncosmopolitan. \n\nYet even as Plato and Aristotle were writing, other Greeks were\nissuing cosmopolitan challenges. Perhaps the most obvious challenges\ncame from the traveling intellectuals who insisted on the contrast\nbetween the conventional ties of politics and the natural ties of\nhumanity. Notice, for example, the way Plato has the Sophist Hippias\naddress the motley crew of Athenians and foreigners present at Callias’\nhouse in Plato’s Protagoras (337c7–d3): \n\nSocrates, too, it can be argued, was sensitive to this more\ncosmopolitan identification with human beings as such. At least as\nPlato characterizes him, Socrates avoids traditional political\nengagement as much as he can, in favor of an extraordinary career of\nexamining himself and others, and he insists that these examinations\nare both genuinely political (Gorg 521d6–8) and extended to\nall, Athenians and foreigners alike (Apol 23b4–6, 30a3–7; cf. Eu. 3d5–9). Of course,\nSocrates chose not to travel widely, but this decision could well have\nbeen consistent with cosmopolitan ideals, for he may have thought that\nhis best bet for serving human beings generally lay in staying at\nhome, on account, ironically, of Athens’ superior freedom of speech\n(Gorg 461e1–3; cf. Apol 37c5–e2 and Meno\n80b4–7). Whether Socrates was self-consciously cosmopolitan in this\nway or not, there is no doubt that his ideas accelerated the\ndevelopment of cosmopolitanism and that he was in later antiquity\nembraced as a citizen of the world. \n\nIn fact, the first philosopher in\nthe West to give perfectly explicit expression to cosmopolitanism was\nthe Socratically inspired Cynic Diogenes in the fourth century BCE. It\nis said that “when he was asked where he came from, he replied,\n‘I am a citizen of the world\n[kosmopolitês]’” (Diogenes Laertius VI 63).\nBy identifying himself not as a citizen of Sinope but as a citizen of\nthe world, Diogenes apparently refused to agree that he owed special\nservice to Sinope and the Sinopeans. So understood, ‘I am a\ncitizen of the cosmos’ is a negative claim, and we might wonder\nif there is any positive content to the Cynic’s world citizenship. The\nmost natural suggestion would be that a world citizen should serve the\nworld-state, helping to bring it about in order to enable the later\nwork of sustaining its institutions and contributing to its common\ngood. But the historical record does not suggest that Diogenes the\nCynic favored the introduction of a world-state. In fact, the\nhistorical record does not unambiguously provide Diogenes any positive\ncommitments that we can readily understand as cosmopolitan. The best\nwe can do to find positive cosmopolitanism in Diogenes is to insist\nthat the whole Cynic way of life is supposed to be cosmopolitan: by\nliving in accordance with nature and rejecting what is conventional,\nthe Cynic sets an example of high-minded virtue for all other human\nbeings. \n\nA fuller exploration of positively committed philosophical\ncosmopolitanism arrives only with the Socratizing and Cynic-influenced\nStoics of the third century CE. These Stoics are fond of saying that\nthe cosmos is, as it were, a polis, because the cosmos is put in\nperfect order by law, which is right reason. They also embrace the\nnegative implication of their high standards: \nconventional poleis do not, strictly speaking, deserve the name, and human beings who are not wise and virtuous do not count as citizens of the cosmos. But\nthe Stoics do not believe that living in agreement with the cosmos –\nas a (virtuous) citizen of the cosmos – requires maintaining critical distance\nfrom conventional poleis. Rather, as the traces of Chrysippus’ On\nLives make clear, the Stoics believe that goodness requires\nserving other human beings as best one can,\nthat serving all human beings equally well is impossible, and that the\nbest service one can give typically requires political engagement. Of\ncourse, the Stoics recognize that political engagement will not be\npossible for everyone, and that some people will best be able to help\nother human beings as private teachers of virtue rather than as\npoliticians. But in no case, the Stoics insist, is consideration of\npolitical engagement to be limited to one’s own polis. The motivating\nidea is, after all, to help human beings as such, and sometimes the\nbest way to do that is to serve as a teacher or as a political advisor\nin some foreign place. In this fashion, the Stoics introduce clear,\npractical content to their metaphor of the cosmopolis: a cosmopolitan\nconsiders moving away in order to serve, whereas a non-cosmopolitan\ndoes not. \n\nThis content admits of a strict and a more moderate interpretation.\nOn the strict view, when one considers whether to emigrate, one\nrecognizes prima facie no special or stronger reason to serve\ncompatriots than to serve a set of human beings abroad. On the moderate\nview, one does introduce into one’s deliberations extra reason to serve\ncompatriots, although one might still, all things considered, make the\nbest choice by emigrating. The evidence does not permit a decisive\nattribution of one or the other of these interpretations to any of the\nearliest Stoics. But if we think that Chrysippus was deeply\nattracted to the Cynics’ rejection of what is merely conventional, then\nwe will find it easy to think of him as a strict\ncosmopolitan. \n\nThings are a bit different for at least some of the Stoics at Rome.\nOn the one hand, the cosmopolis becomes less demanding. Whereas\nChrysippus limits citizenship in the cosmos to those who in fact live\nin agreement with the cosmos and its law, Roman Stoics extend\ncitizenship to all human beings by virtue of their rationality. On the\nother hand, local citizenship becomes more demanding. There is no\ndoubt that the Stoicism of Cicero’s De Officiis or of\nSeneca’s varied corpus explicitly acknowledges obligations to\nRome in addition to obligations to the cosmos. This is a moderate Stoic cosmopolitanism, and empire made the\ndoctrine very easy for many Romans by identifying the Roman\npatria with the cosmopolis itself. But neither imperialism\nnor a literal interpretation of world citizenship is required for the\nphilosophical point. The maximally committed cosmopolitan looks around\nto determine whom he can best help and how, knowing full well that he\ncannot help all people in just the same way, and his decision to help\nsome people far more than others is justified by cosmopolitan lights\nif it is the best he can do to help human beings as such. \n\nStoic cosmopolitanism in its various guises was enormously persuasive\nthroughout the Greco-Roman world. In part, this success can be\nexplained by noting how cosmopolitan the world at that time was.\nAlexander the Great’s conquests and the subsequent division of his\nempire into successor kingdoms sapped local cities of much of their\ntraditional authority and fostered increased contacts between cities,\nand later, the rise of the Roman Empire united the whole of the\nMediterranean under one political power. But it is wrong to say what\nhas frequently been said, that cosmopolitanism arose as a\nresponse to the fall of the polis or to the rise of the Roman\nempire. First, the polis’ fall has been greatly exaggerated. Under the\nsuccessor kingdoms and even – though to a lesser degree –\nunder Rome, there remained substantial room for important political\nengagement locally. Second, and more decisively, the cosmopolitanism\nthat was so persuasive during the so-called Hellenistic Age and under\nthe Roman Empire was in fact rooted in intellectual developments that\npredate Alexander’s conquests. Still, there is no doubting\nthat the empires under which Stoicism developed and flourished made\nmany people more receptive to the cosmopolitan ideal and thus\ncontributed greatly to the widespread influence of Stoic\ncosmopolitanism. \n\nNowhere was Stoic cosmopolitanism itself more influential than in\nearly Christianity. Early Christians took the later Stoic recognition\nof two cities as independent sources of obligation and added a twist.\nFor the Stoics, the citizens of the polis and the citizens of\nthe cosmopolis do the same work: both aim to improve the\nlives of the citizens. The Christians respond to a different call:\n“Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and\nunto God the things that are God’s” (Matthew 22:21). On this\nview, the local city may have divine authority (John 19:11;\ncf. Romans 13:1,4,7), but the most important work for human\ngoodness is removed from traditional politics, set aside in a sphere in\nwhich people of all nations can become “fellow-citizens with the\nsaints” (Ephesians 2:20). \n\nThis development has two important and long-lasting consequences,\nwhich are canonized by Augustine. First, the cosmopolis again becomes a\ncommunity for certain people only. Augustine makes this point most\nexplicitly by limiting the citizenship in the city of God to those who\nlove God. All others are relegated to the inferior – though still\nuniversal – earthly city by their love of self. These two cities of\nthe world, which are doomed to coexist intertwined until the Final\nJudgment, divide the world’s inhabitants. Second, the work of politics\nis severed from the task of building good human lives, lives of\nrighteousness and justice. While Augustine can stress that this allows\ncitizens in the city of God to obey local laws concerning “the\nnecessaries for the maintenance of life,” he must also\nacknowledge that it sets up a potential conflict over the laws of\nreligion and the concerns of righteousness and justice (e.g.,\nCivitas Dei XIX 17). \n\nFor hundreds of years to come, debates in political philosophy would\nsurround the relation between ‘temporal’ political\nauthority and the ‘eternal Church.’ But emphasis on the\ncosmopolitan aspect of the Church waned, despite its ideal of a\nreligious community comprising all humans. In a nutshell, the debate\nnow opposed the secular and the religious, and not the local and the\ncosmopolitan. To be sure, this debate often had cosmopolitan\nramifications, which are clear enough in Dante Alighieri’s plea for a\nuniversal monarchy in De Monarchia (ca. 1314).  But his case\ndraws from Aristotle and Roman history, not explicitly from the ideal\nof a cosmopolis or of world citizenship, and he remains deeply\nconcerned to adjudicate between the pope and the Holy Roman Emperor.\n \n\nCosmopolitanism slowly began to come to the fore again with the\nrenewed study of more ancient texts, but during the humanist era\ncosmopolitanism still remained the exception. Despite the fact that\nancient cosmopolitan sources were well-known and that many humanists\nemphasized the essential unity of all religions, they did not develop\nthis idea in cosmopolitan terms. A few authors, however, most notably\nErasmus of Rotterdam, explicitly drew on ancient cosmopolitanism to\nadvocate the ideal of a world-wide peace. Emphasizing the unity of\nhumankind over its division into different states and peoples, by\narguing that humans are destined by Nature to be sociable and live in\nharmony, Erasmus pleaded for national and religious tolerance and\nregarded like-minded people as his compatriots (Querela\nPacis). \n\nEarly modern natural law theory might seem a likely candidate for\nspawning philosophical cosmopolitanism. Its secularizing tendencies and\nthe widespread individualist view among its defenders that all humans\nshare certain fundamental characteristics would seem to suggest a point\nof unification for humankind as a whole. However, according to many\nearly modern theorists, what all individuals share is a fundamental\nstriving for self-preservation, and the universality of this striving\ndoes not amount to a fundamental bond that unites (or should unite) all\nhumans in a universal community. \n\nStill, there are two factors that do sometimes push modern natural\nlaw theory in a cosmopolitan direction.  First, some\nnatural law theorists assume that nature implanted in humans, in\naddition to the tendency to self-preservation, also a\nfellow-feeling, a form of sociability that unites all humans at a\nfundamental level into a kind of world community. The appeal to such a\nshared human bond was very thin, however, and by no means does it\nnecessarily lead to cosmopolitanism. In fact, the very notion of a\nnatural sociability was sometimes used instead to legitimate war\nagainst peoples elsewhere in the world who were said to have violated\nthis common bond in an ‘unnatural’ way, or who were easily\nsaid to have placed themselves outside of the domain of common human\nmorality by their ‘barbaric’ customs. Second, early modern\nnatural law theory was often connected with social contract theory, and\nalthough most social contract theorists worked out their views mostly,\nif not solely, for the level of the state and not for that of\ninternational relations, the very idea behind social contract theory\nlends itself for application to this second level. Grotius, Pufendorf,\nand others did draw out these implications and thereby laid the\nfoundation for international law. Grotius envisioned a “great\nsociety of states” that is bound by a “law of\nnations” that holds “between all states” (De Iure\nBelli ac Paci, 1625, Prolegomena par. 17; Pufendorf, De Iure\nNaturae et Gentium, 1672). \n\nThe historical context of the philosophical resurgence of\ncosmopolitanism during the Enlightenment is made up of many factors:\nThe increasing rise of capitalism and world-wide trade and its\ntheoretical reflections; the reality of ever expanding empires whose\nreach extended across the globe; the voyages around the world and the\nanthropological so-called ‘discoveries’ facilitated through\nthese; the renewed interest in Hellenistic philosophy; and the\nemergence of a notion of human rights and a philosophical focus on\nhuman reason. Many intellectuals of the time regarded their membership\nin the transnational ‘republic of letters’ as more\nsignificant than their membership in the particular political states\nthey found themselves in, all the more so because their relationship\nwith their government was often strained because of censorship issues.\nThis prepared them to think in terms other than those of states and\npeoples and adopt a cosmopolitan perspective. Under the influence of\nthe American Revolution, and especially during the first years of the\nFrench Revolution, cosmopolitanism received its strongest impulse. The\n1789 declaration of ‘human’ rights had grown out of\ncosmopolitan modes of thinking and reinforced them in turn. \n\nIn the eighteenth century, the terms ‘cosmopolitanism’\nand ‘world citizenship’ were often used not as labels for\ndeterminate philosophical theories, but rather to indicate an attitude\nof open-mindedness and impartiality. A cosmopolitan was someone who was\nnot subservient to a particular religious or political authority,\nsomeone who was not biased by particular loyalties or cultural\nprejudice. Furthermore, the term was sometimes used to indicate a\nperson who led an urbane life-style, or who was fond of traveling,\ncherished a network of international contacts, or felt at home\neverywhere. In this sense the Encyclopédie mentioned that\n‘cosmopolitan’ was often used to signify a “man of no\nfixed abode, or a man who is nowhere a stranger.” Though\nphilosophical authors such as Montesquieu, Voltaire, Diderot, Addison,\nHume, and Jefferson identified themselves as cosmopolitans in one or\nmore of these senses, these usages are not of much philosophical\ninterest. \n\nEspecially in the second half of the century, however, the term was\nincreasingly also used to indicate particular philosophical\nconvictions. Some authors revived the Cynic tradition. Fougeret de\nMontbron in his 1753 autobiographical report, Le Cosmopolite,\ncalls himself a cosmopolitan, describes how he travels everywhere\nwithout being committed to anywhere, declaring “All the countries\nare the same to me” and “[I am] changing my places of\nresidence according to my whim” (p. 130). \n\nDespite the fact that only a few authors committed\nthemselves to this kind of cosmopolitanism, this was the version that\ncritics of cosmopolitanism took as their target. For example, Rousseau\ncomplains that cosmopolitans “boast that they love everyone\n[tout le monde, which also means ‘the whole\nworld’], to have the right to love no one” (Geneva\nManuscript version of The Social Contract, 158). Johann Georg\nSchlosser, in the critical poem ‘Der Kosmopolit’ writes,\n“It is better to be proud of one’s nation than to have\nnone,” obviously assuming that cosmopolitanism implies the\nlatter. \n\nYet most eighteenth-century defenders of cosmopolitanism did not\nrecognize their own view in these critical descriptions. They\nunderstood cosmopolitanism not as a form of ultra-individualism, but\nrather, drawing on the Stoic tradition, as implying the positive moral\nideal of a universal human community, and they did not regard this\nideal as inimical to more particular attachments. \nSome, like the German author Christoph Martin Wieland, stayed quite\nclose to Stoic views. Others developed a cosmopolitan moral theory that\nwas distinctively new. According to Kant, all rational beings are\nmembers in a single moral community. They are analogous to citizens in\nthe political (republican) sense in that they share the characteristics\nof freedom, equality, and independence, and that they live under their own laws. Their common laws, however, are the laws of morality, grounded\nin reason. Early utilitarian cosmopolitans like Jeremy Bentham, by\ncontrast, defended their cosmopolitanism by pointing to the\n“common and equal utility of all nations.” Moral\ncosmopolitanism could be grounded in human reason, or in some other\ncharacteristic universally shared among humans (and in some cases other\nkinds of beings) such as the capacity to experience pleasure or pain, a\nmoral sense, or the aesthetic imagination. Moral cosmopolitans regarded\nall humans as ‘brothers’ – an analogy with which they aimed to indicate the fundamental\nequality of rank of all humans, which precluded slavery, colonial\nexploitation, feudal hierarchy, and tutelage of various sorts. As the term ‘brothers’ indicates, however, this does not mean that their own thought was always free from bias and inconsistency. Indeed, numerous authors combined their moral cosmopolitanism with a defense of the superiority of men over women, or that of “whites” over other “races.” A notable example is Kant, who defended European colonialism before he became very critical of it in the mid 1790s (Kleingeld 2014), and who never gave up the view that women were inferior to men in morally relevant respects. \n\nSome cosmopolitans developed their view into a political theory\nabout international relations. The most radical of eighteenth-century\npolitical cosmopolitans was no doubt Anacharsis Cloots (Jean-Baptiste\ndu Val-de-Grace, baron de Cloots, 1755–1794). Cloots advocated the\nabolition of all existing states and the establishment of a single\nworld state under which all human individuals would be directly\nsubsumed. His arguments drew first of all on the general structure of\nsocial contract theory. If it is in the general interest for everyone\nto submit to the authority of a state that enforces laws that provide\nsecurity, then this argument applies world-wide and justifies the\nestablishment of a world-wide “republic of united\nindividuals,” not a plurality of states that find themselves in\nthe state of nature vis-à-vis each other. Second, he argues that\nsovereignty should reside with the people, and that the concept of\nsovereignty itself, because it involves indivisibility, implies that\nthere can be but one sovereign body in the world, namely, the human\nrace as a whole (La république universelle ou adresse aux\ntyrannicides, 1792; Bases constitutionelles de la\nrépublique du genre humain, 1793). Most other political cosmopolitans did not go as far as\nCloots. Immanuel Kant, most famously, advocated a much weaker form of\ninternational legal order, namely, that of a ‘league of\nnations.’ In Toward Perpetual Peace (1795) Kant argues\nthat true and world-wide peace is possible only when states organize\nthemselves internally according to ‘republican’\nprinciples, when they organize themselves externally in a voluntary\nleague for the sake of keeping peace, and when they respect the human\nrights not only of their citizens but also of foreigners. He argues\nthat the league of states should not have coercive military powers\nbecause that would violate the internal sovereignty of states.  Some critics argued in response that Kant’s position was\ninconsistent, because on their view, the only way to fully overcome\nthe state of nature among states was for the latter to enter into a\nfederative union with coercive powers. The early Fichte transformed\nthe concept of sovereignty in the process, by conceiving it as\nlayered, and this enabled them to argue that states ought to transfer\npart of their sovereignty to the federal level, but only that part\nthat concerns their external relations to other states, while\nretaining the sovereignty of the states concerning their internal\naffairs. Romantic authors, on the other hand, felt that the ideal\nstate should not have to involve coercion at all, and hence also that\nthe cosmopolitan ideal should be that of a world-wide republic of\n‘fraternal’ non-authoritarian republics (the young\nFriedrich Schlegel). Especially the first objection has been repeated ever since, but\nmore recent interpretations have questioned its legitimacy (Kleingeld\n2004, 2012), arguing that Kant can also be read as advocating the\nloose league as a first step on the road toward a federation with\ncoercive powers. Because joining this stronger form of federation\nshould be a voluntary decision on the part of the peoples involved, to\nhonor their political autonomy, the strong federation is not a matter\nof coercive international right. On this interpretation, Kant’s\ndefense of the loose league is much more consistent.  \n\nKant also introduced the concept of “cosmopolitan law,” suggesting a\nthird sphere of public law – in addition to constitutional law\nand international law – in which both states and individuals\nhave rights, and where individuals have these rights as “citizens of\nthe earth” rather than as citizens of particular states. In addition to moral and political forms of cosmopolitanism, there\nemerged an economic form of cosmopolitan theory. The freer trade\nadvocated by eighteenth-century anti-mercantilists, especially Adam\nSmith, was developed further into the ideal of a global free market by\nDietrich Hermann Hegewisch (Kleingeld 2012). His ideal was a world in\nwhich tariffs and other restrictions on foreign trade are abolished, a\nworld in which the market, not the government, takes care of the needs\nof the people. Against mercantilism, he argued that it is more\nadvantageous for everyone involved if a nation imports those goods\nwhich are more expensive to produce domestically, and that the\nabolition of protectionism would benefit everyone. If other states\nwere to gain from their exports, they would reach a higher standard of\nliving and become even better trading partners, because they could\nthen import more, too. Moreover, on Hegewisch’s view, after trade will\nhave been liberalized world-wide, the importance of national\ngovernments will diminish dramatically. As national governments are\nmostly focused on the national economy and defense, he argued, their\nfuture role will be at most auxiliary. The freer the global market\nbecomes, the more the role of the states will become negligible. Enlightenment cosmopolitanism continued to be a source of debate in\nthe subsequent two centuries. First, in the nineteenth century,\neconomic globalization provoked fierce reactions. Marx and Engels tag\ncosmopolitanism as an ideological reflection of capitalism. They\nregard market capitalism as inherently expansive, breaking the bounds\nof the nation-state system, as evidenced by the fact that production\nand consumption had become attuned to faraway lands. In their hands,\nthe word ‘cosmopolitan’ is tied to the effects of\ncapitalist globalization, including especially the bourgeois ideology\nwhich legitimizes ‘free’ trade in terms of the freedom\nof individuals and mutual benefit, although this very capitalist order\nis the cause of the misery of millions, indeed the cause of the very\nexistence of the proletariat. At the same time, however, Marx and\nEngels also hold that the proletariat in every country shares\nessential features and has common interests, and the Communist\nmovement aims to convince proletarians everywhere of these common\ninterests. Most famously, the Communist Manifesto ends with\nthe call, “Proletarians of all countries, unite!” This,\ncombined with the ideal of the class-less society and the expected\nwithering away of the states after the revolution, implies a form of\ncosmopolitanism of its own. \n\nDebates about global capitalism and about an international workers’\nmovement have persisted. Frequently economic cosmopolitanism can be\nfound in the advocacy of open markets, in the tradition from Adam Smith\nto Friedrich von Hayek and Milton Friedman. Communist versions of\ncosmopolitanism also developed further, although the Leninist-Stalinist\ntradition kept using ‘cosmopolitan’ itself as a derogatory\nterm. \n\nThe second inheritance from eighteenth century cosmopolitanism is\nfound in the two centuries’ worth of attempts to create peace. It has\noften been noted that there are parallels between Kant’s peace\nproposal in Toward Perpetual Peace and the structure of the\nLeague of Nations as it existed in the early part of the 20th century\nas well as the structure of the current United Nations, although it\nshould also be pointed out that essential features of Kant’s plan were\nnot implemented, such as the abolition of standing armies. After the end of the cold war, discussion about the most appropriate world order to promote global peace resurged, just as it did after the first and second world wars. \n\nThe International Criminal Court should be mentioned here as an\ninnovative form of cosmopolitanism, going much beyond Kant’s\nconception of ‘cosmopolitan law.’ The ICC itself\nrepresents an extension of the long trend, in international law, to do\naway with the principle of the absolute subjection of individuals to\nthe state and strengthen the status of individuals. Individuals are\nnow the bearers of certain rights under international law, and they\ncan be held responsible for crimes under international law in ways\nthat cut through the shield of state sovereignty. \n\nThird, moral philosophers and moralists in the wake of\neighteenth-century cosmopolitanisms have insisted that we human beings\nhave a duty to aid fellow humans in need, regardless of their\ncitizenship status. There is a history of international relief efforts\n(International Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, famine relief\norganizations, and the like) in the name of the reduction of human\nsuffering and without regard to the nationality of those affected. \n\nIn addition, because cosmopolitan duty is not restricted to duties of\nbeneficence but also requires justice and respect, cosmopolitan values\nand principles have often been invoked as a motivation to oppose\nslavery and apartheid, and to advocate the emancipation of women. \n\nMost past cosmopolitan authors did not fully live up to the literal\ninterpretation of their cosmopolitan theories, and one can find\nmisogynist, racist, nationalist, sectarian, or class-based biases and\ninconsistencies in their accounts. These shortcomings have often been\nused as arguments against cosmopolitanism, but they are not as easily\nused for that purpose as it may seem. Because the universalist\npotential in the discourse of ‘world citizenship’ can\nitself be used as a basis for exposing these shortcomings as\nproblematic, one should say that they stem from too little, rather than\ntoo much, cosmopolitanism. \n\nEven this brief glance backwards reveals a wide variety of views that\ncan be called cosmopolitan. Every cosmopolitan argues for some\ncommunity among all human beings, regardless of social and political\naffiliation. For some, what should be shared is simply moral\ncommunity, which means only that living a good human life requires\nserving the universal community by helping human beings as such,\nperhaps by promoting the realization of justice and the guarantee of\nhuman rights.  Others conceptualize the universal community in terms\nof political institutions to be shared by all, in terms of cultural\nexpressions that can be shared or appreciated by all, or in terms of\neconomic markets that should be open to all.  \n\nThe most common cosmopolitanism – moral cosmopolitanism\n– does not always call itself such. But just as ancient\ncosmopolitanism was fundamentally a ‘moral’ commitment to\nhelping human beings as such, much contemporary moral philosophy\ninsists on the duty to aid foreigners who are starving or otherwise\nsuffering, or at least on the duty to respect and promote basic human\nrights and justice.  One can here distinguish between strict and\nmoderate forms of cosmopolitanism. The strict cosmopolitans\nin this sphere operate sometimes from utilitarian assumptions (e.g.,\nSinger, Unger), sometimes from Kantian assumptions (e.g., O’Neill),\nand sometimes from more ancient assumptions (e.g., Nussbaum), but\nalways with the claim that the duty to provide aid neither gets\nweighed against any extra duty to help locals or compatriots nor\nincreases in strength when locals or compatriots are in\nquestion. Among these strict cosmopolitans some will say that it is\npermissible, at least in some situations, to concentrate one’s\ncharitable efforts on one’s compatriots, while others deny this\n– their position will depend on the details of their moral\ntheory. Other philosophers whom we may call moderate\ncosmopolitans (including, e.g., Scheffler) acknowledge the\ncosmopolitan scope of a duty to provide aid, but insist that we also\nhave special duties to compatriots. Among the moderate cosmopolitans,\nmany further distinctions can be drawn, depending on the reasons that\nare admitted for recognizing special responsibilities to compatriots\nand depending on how the special responsibilities are balanced with\nthe cosmopolitan duties to human beings generally. \n\nMoral cosmopolitanism has sometimes led to political\ncosmopolitanism. Again, we can draw useful distinctions among the\npolitical cosmopolitans. Some advocate a centralized world state, some\nfavor a federal system with a comprehensive global body of limited\ncoercive power, some would prefer international political institutions\nthat are limited in scope and focus on particular concerns (e.g., war\ncrimes, environmental preservation), and some defend a different\nalternative altogether. Prominent philosophical discussions of\ninternational political arrangements have recently clustered around\nthe heirs of Kant (e.g., Habermas, Rawls, Beitz, and Pogge) and around\nadvocates of ‘cosmopolitan democracy’ (e.g., Held) or\n‘republican cosmopolitanism’ (Bohman 2001, Laborde 2010, Pettit 2010, 2016). \n\nA number of theorists have objected to the focus, in much of the\ndebate over political cosmopolitanism, on the role of states. In their\nview, a genuinely cosmopolitan theory should address the needs and\ninterests of human individuals directly – as world\ncitizens – instead of indirectly, as state citizens, that is via\ntheir membership in particular states. What is needed instead is a\ntheory that focuses not merely on the moral duties of individuals or\non the political relations among states, but on the justice of social\ninstitutions world-wide and the measures required to attain it. This\n‘cosmopolitan’ position in the debate over global\ndistributive justice, is especially critical of what they see as\nJohn Rawls’ privileging of the interests of states over those of\nindividuals, in his Theory of Justice as well as in his\nsubsequent Law of Peoples. In order to establish principles\nof global justice, Rawls should have applied his famous thought\nexperiment of the ‘original position’ at the global level\nof all human individuals, they charge, instead of arguing, as Rawls\ndoes, for a second original position, one that involves\nrepresentatives of all ‘peoples’. The debate between Rawls\nand his cosmopolitan critics points to the issue of the proper role\nand status of states: are they indispensable instruments in the\npursuit of justice (ideally embodying the principle of the democratic\nself-determination of peoples), or are they rather inimical to it,\nbecause they entrench state interests at the expense of individuals in\nneed? \n\nFurthermore, there has been a good deal of debate\nover cultural cosmopolitanism, with disputes over\nmulticulturalism in educational curricula and with resurgent\nnationalisms. The cosmopolitan position in these\ndisputes rejects exclusive attachments to a particular culture. So on\nthe one hand, the cosmopolitan encourages cultural diversity and\nappreciates a multicultural mélange, and on the other hand, the\ncosmopolitan rejects a strong nationalism. In staking out these\nclaims, the cosmopolitan must be wary about very strong ‘rights\nto culture,’ respecting the rights of minority cultures while\nrebuffing the right to unconditional national\nself-determination. Hence, recent advocates of ‘liberal\nnationalism’ (e.g., Margalit and Raz, Tamir) or of the rights of\nminority cultures (e.g., Kymlicka) generally seem to be\nanti-cosmopolitan. But the cosmopolitan’s wariness towards very strong\nrights to culture and towards national self-determination need not be\ngrounded in a wholesale skepticism about the importance of particular\ncultural attachments. Cosmopolitanism can acknowledge the importance\nof (at least some kinds of) cultural attachments for the good human\nlife (at least within certain limits), while denying that this implies\nthat a person’s cultural identity should be defined by any bounded or\nhomogeneous subset of the cultural resources available in the world\n(e.g., Waldron). \n\nEconomic cosmopolitanism is perhaps less often defended\namong philosophers and more often among economists (e.g., Hayek,\nFriedman) and certain politicians, especially in the richer countries\nof this world. It is the view that one ought to cultivate a single\nglobal economic market with free trade and minimal political\ninvolvement. It tends to be criticized rather than advanced by\nphilosophical cosmopolitans, as many of them regard it as at least a\npartial cause of the problem of vast international economic inequality.\nThese debates about the desirability of a fully globalized market have\nintensified in recent years, as a result of the end of the Cold War and\nthe increasing reach of the market economy. \n\nOne of the most common objections to cosmopolitanism attacks a position\nthat is in fact made of straw. Often it is said that cosmopolitanism is\nmeaningless without the context of a world–state or that\ncosmopolitanism necessarily involves the commitment to a world state.\nThese claims are historically uninformed, because cosmopolitanism as a\nconcept arose in the first instance as a metaphor for a way of life and\nnot in literal guise. Ever since, there have been cosmopolitans who do\nnot touch on the issue of international political organization, and of\nthose who do, very few defend the ideal of a world–state. Furthermore,\neven those cosmopolitans who do favor a world-state tend to support\nsomething more sophisticated that cannot be dismissed out of hand, such as a\nthin conception of world government with layered sovereignty.  Another common objection to cosmopolitanism associates it with imperialism, colonialism, and paternalism. Some cosmopolitans, despite taking themselves to be opposed to imperialism, colonialism, and paternalism, are charged with focusing too narrowly on the responsibilities (and perspectives) of the affluent while conceiving of those living in poverty mainly as the passive recipients of their “aid.” Such focus indeed shows little sensitivity to questions of epistemic justice and to the wide range of perspectives that merit being taken seriously (Flikschuh 2017). These charges are often internal to cosmopolitanism, however, as they do not so much call into question the cosmopolitan ideal itself as reject certain limited instantiations of it. Cosmopolitans can and do examine the entitlements of those living in poverty (Caney 2015) and argue in favor of poor-led social movements (Deveaux 2018) and alternative forms of cosmopolitanism “from below” (Bailey 2017). Others point to the relevance, for cosmopolitan theorizing, of poverty-driven labor migration and migrant activism as acts of world citizenship (Caraus and Paris 2018). \n\nThere are, however, serious and philosophically interesting challenges to\ncosmopolitanism itself, and they come in two main forms. The first calls into question\nthe possibility of realizing the cosmopolitan ideal, while the second\nqueries its desirability. We discuss these two challenges to the\ndifferent forms of cosmopolitanism in turn. \n\nIt is often argued that it is impossible to change the current system\nof states and to form a world–state or a global federation of\nstates. This claim is hard to maintain, however, in the face of the\nexistence of the United Nations, the existence of states with more\nthan a billion people of heterogeneous backgrounds, and the experience\nwith the United States and the European Union. So in order to be taken\nseriously, the objection must instead be that it is impossible to form\na good state or federation of that magnitude, i.e., that it\nis impossible to realize or even approximate the cosmopolitan ideal in\na way that makes it worth pursuing and that does not carry prohibitive\nrisks. Here political cosmopolitans disagree among themselves. On one\nend of the spectrum we find those who argue in favor of a strong\nworld-state, on the other end we find the defenders of a loose and\nvoluntary federation, or a different system altogether. \n\nThe defenders of the loose, voluntary and noncoercive federation warn\nthat a world-state easily becomes despotic without there being any\ncompeting power left to break the hold of despotism (Rawls).\nDefenders of the world-state reply that a stronger form of federation,\nor even merger, is the only way to truly exit the state of nature\nbetween states, or the only way to bring about international\ndistributive justice (Nielsen, Cabrera). Other authors have argued that the focus among\nmany political cosmopolitans on only these two alternatives overlooks\na third cosmopolitan position, and that a concern for human rights should lead one to focus\ninstead on institutional reform that disperses sovereignty vertically,\nrather than concentrating it in all-encompassing international\ninstitutions. On this view, peace, democracy, prosperity, and the\nenvironment would be better served by a system in which the political\nallegiance and loyalties of persons are widely dispersed over a number\nof political units of various sizes, without any one unit being\ndominant and thus occupying the traditional role of the state\n(Pogge). \n\nOf the objections brought up by non- or anti-cosmopolitans, two\ndeserve special mention. First, some authors argue that the (partial or\nwhole) surrender of state sovereignty required by the cosmopolitan\nscheme is an undue violation of the principle of the autonomy of states\nor the principle of democratic self-determination of their citizens.\nSecond, so-called ‘realists’ argue that states are in a\nHobbesian state of nature as far as the relations among them are\nconcerned, and that it is as inappropriate as it is futile to subject\nstates to normative constraints. To these objections cosmopolitans have\nvarious kinds of response, ranging from developing their alternative\nnormative theory (e.g., by arguing that global democracy increases\nrather than diminishes the democratic control of individual world\ncitizens) to pointing out, as has been done at least since Grotius,\nthat states have good reasons even on Hobbesian grounds to submit to\ncertain forms of international legal arrangements. \n\nVarious arguments have been used to show that economic cosmopolitanism\nis not a viable option. Marx and later Marxists have argued that\ncapitalism is self-destructive in the long run, because the\nexploitation, alienation, and poverty that it inflicts on the\nproletariat will provoke a world-wide revolution that will bring about\nthe end of capitalism. In the twentieth century, when nationalist\ntendencies proved to be stronger (or in any case more easily mobilized)\nthan international solidarity, and when the position of workers was\nstrengthened to the point of making them unwilling to risk a\nrevolution, this forced the left to reconsider this view.  \n\nCritics of the economic cosmopolitan ideal have also started to\nemphasize another way in which capitalism bears the seeds of its own\ndestruction within itself, namely, insofar as it is said to lead to a\nglobal environmental disaster that might spell the end of the human\nspecies, or in any event the end of capitalism as we know it. The\neffects of excessive consumption (in some parts of the world) and the\nexploitation of nature would make the earth inhospitable to future\nhuman generations. \n\nEven if one does not think that these first two problems are so\nserious as to make economic cosmopolitanism unviable, they can still\nmake it seem undesirable in the eyes of those who are\nconcerned with poverty, environmental destruction, and the impact of climate change. \n\nMoreover, there are several other concerns that lead critics to\nregard economic cosmopolitanism as undesirable. First among these is\nthe lack of effective democratic control by the vast majority of the\nworld’s population, as large multinationals are able to impose demands\non states that are in a weak economic position and their populations,\ndemands that they cannot reasonably refuse to meet, although this does\nnot mean that they meet them fully voluntarily. This concerns, for\nexample, labor conditions or the use of raw materials in developing countries. \n\nSecond, economic cosmopolitans are accused of failing to pay attention\nto a number of probable side-effects of a global free market. In\nparticular, they are criticized for neglecting or downplaying issues\nsuch as (a) the vast inequality of wealth and extreme poverty without\nthere being any reliable mechanism to provide relief, if they reduce\nthe role of political institutions (b) the presupposition of\nlarge-scale migration or re-schooling when jobs disappear in one area\n(the loss of ties to friends and family, language, culture, etc., and\nthe monetary costs of moving or re-tooling), (c) the lack of a\nguarantee that there will be a sufficient supply of living-wage jobs\nfor all world citizens (especially given increasing automation. They\nare similarly accused of failing to take seriously the fact that there\nmight be circumstances under which it would be profitable for some\nstates to be protectionist or wage war, such as wars about markets or\nraw materials and energy (e.g., oil). \n\nAnother version of the criticism that cosmopolitanism is impossible\ntargets the psychological assumptions of moral cosmopolitanism. Here\nit is said that human beings must have stronger attachments toward\nmembers of their own state or nation, and that attempts to disperse\nattachments to fellow-citizens in order to honor a moral community\nwith human beings as such will undermine our psychological\nfunctioning. If this is a viability claim and not simply\na desirability claim, then it must be supposed that moral\ncosmopolitanism would literally leave large numbers of people unable\nto function. So it is claimed that people need a particular sense of\nnational identity in order to be agents, and that a particular sense\nof national identity requires attachment to particular others\nperceived to have a similar identity. But this does not seem to be\ntrue as an empirical generalization. The cosmopolitan does not need to\ndeny that some people do happen to have the need for national\nallegiance, so long as it is true that not all people do; and insofar\nas some people do, the strict cosmopolitan will say that perhaps it\ndoes not need to be that way and that cosmopolitan education might\nlead to a different result. The historical record gives even the\nstrict cosmopolitan some cause for cheer, as human psychology and the\nforms of political organization have proven to be quite plastic.  \n\nIn fact, some cosmopolitans have adopted a developmental psychology\naccording to which patriotism is a step on the way to cosmopolitanism:\nas human individuals mature they develop ever wider loyalties and\nallegiances, starting with attachments to their caregivers and ending\nwith allegiance to humanity at large. These different attachments are\nnot necessarily in competition with each other. Just as loyalty to\none’s family need not be an obstacle for state citizens, so loyalty to\none’s state need not be a problem for cosmopolitans. Thus,\ncosmopolitanism is regarded as an extension of a developmental process\nthat also includes the development of patriotism. This claim is just\nas much in need of empirical support, however, as the opposite claim\ndiscussed in the previous paragraph. \n\nOften, though, the critic’s arguments about psychological\npossibility are actually run together with desirability\nclaims. The critic says that the elimination of a special motivating\nattachment to fellow-citizens is not possible, but the critic means\nthat the elimination of special motivating attachments to\nfellow-citizens will make a certain desirable form of political life\nimpossible. To respond to this sort of argument, the cosmopolitan has\ntwo routes open. First, she can deny the claim itself. Perhaps the\nviability of politics as usual depends not upon certain beliefs that\nfellow-citizens deserve more of one’s service, but upon commitments to\nthe polity itself. If strictly cosmopolitan patriotism is a\npossibility, it lives in a commitment to a universal set of principles\nembodied in a particular political constitution and a particular set of\npolitical institutions. If such commitment is enough for desirable\npolitics, then the anti-cosmopolitan is disarmed. But second, the\ncosmopolitan can of course also deny the value of the form of political\nlife that is posited as desirable. At this point, moral commitments run\nover into a discussion of political theory. \n\nOccasionally it is said that cosmopolitans are treasonous or at least\nunreliable citizens. But many recognizably cosmopolitan theses (that\nis, the moderate ones) are consistent with loyalty to fellow-citizens,\nand even the strictest cosmopolitan can justify some forms of service\nto fellow-citizens when they are an optimal way to promote justice or\nto do good for human beings (who might happen to be\nfellow-citizens). \n\nThis last criticism can be developed further, however, and tailored\nspecifically to target the strict cosmopolitan. If the strict\ncosmopolitan can justify only some forms of service to fellow-citizens,\nunder some conditions, it might be said that she is blind to other\nmorally required forms or conditions of service to fellow-citizens. At\nthis point, the critic offers reasons why a person has special\nobligations to compatriots, which are missed by the strict\ncosmopolitan. Many critics who introduce these reasons are themselves\nmoderate cosmopolitans, wishing to demonstrate that there are special\nobligations to fellow-citizens in addition to general duties to the\ncommunity of all human beings. But if these reasons are demanding\nenough, then there may be no room left for any community with all human\nbeings, and so these objections to strict cosmopolitanism can also\nprovide some impetus toward an anti-cosmopolitan stance. Because there\nare several such reasons that are frequently proposed, there are, in\neffect, several objections to the strictly cosmopolitan position, and\nthey should be considered one-by-one. \n\nThe first narrow objection to strict cosmopolitanism is that it\nneglects the obligations of reciprocity. According to this argument, we\nhave obligations to give benefits in return for benefits received, and\nwe receive benefits from our fellow-citizens. The best strictly\ncosmopolitan response to this argument will insist on a distinction\nbetween the state and fellow-citizens and will question exactly who\nprovides which benefits and what is owed in return. On grounds of\nreciprocity the state may be owed certain things – cooperative\nobedience – and these things may in fact generally benefit\nfellow-citizens. But the state is not owed these things\nbecause one owes the fellow-citizens benefits. One does not\nappropriately signal gratitude for benefits received from the state by,\nsay, giving more to local charities than to charities abroad because\ncharity like this does not address the full agent responsible for the\nbenefits one has received, and does not even seem to be the sort of\nthing that is commensurate with the benefits received. In assessing\nthis exchange of arguments, there are some significantly difficult\nquestions to answer concerning exactly how the receipt of benefits\nobliges one to make a return. \n\nA second objection to strict moral cosmopolitanism gives contractarian\ngrounds for our obligations to fellow-citizens. Because actual\nagreements to prioritize fellow-citizens as beneficiaries are\ndifficult to find, the contractarians generally rely upon an implicit\nagreement that expresses the interests or values of the\nfellow-citizens themselves. So the contractarian argument turns on\nidentifying interests or values that obligate fellow-citizens to\nbenefit each other. Perhaps, then, it will be argued that citizens\nhave deep interests in what a successful civil society and state can\noffer them, and that these interests commit the citizens to an\nimplicit agreement to benefit fellow-citizens. The strict cosmopolitan\nwill reply to such an argument with skepticism about what is required\nfor the civil society. Why is more than cooperative obedience required\nby our interests in what a successful state and civil society can\nprovide?  Surely some citizens have to dedicate themselves to working\non behalf of this particular society, but why can they not do so on\nthe grounds that this is the best way to benefit human beings as such?\nPerhaps an intermediate position here is the (Kantian) view that it is\nmorally necessary to establish just democratic states and that just\ndemocratic states need some special commitment on the part of their\ncitizens in order to function as democracies, a special commitment\nthat goes beyond mere cooperative obedience but that can still be\ndefended in universalist cosmopolitan terms. For given that\ndemocracies require this special commitment as a condition of their\npossibility, it would be incoherent to promote justice in general by\npromoting just democracies while rejecting, as a matter of principle,\nthat which is required for just democracies to function. \n\nThe final argument for recognizing obligations to benefit\nfellow-citizens appeals to what David Miller has called\n‘relational facts.’ Here the general thought is that\ncertain relationships are constituted by reciprocal obligations: one\ncannot be a friend or a brother without having certain\nfriendship-obligations or sibling-obligations, respectively. If\nfellow-citizenship is like these other relations, then we would seem to\nhave special obligations to fellow-citizens. But this argument, which\ncan be found in Cicero’s De Officiis, depends upon our\nintuitions that fellow-citizenship is like friendship or brotherhood\nand that friendship and brotherhood do come with special obligations,\nand both intuitions require more argument. Frequently, these arguments\nappeal to alleged facts about human nature or about human psychology,\nbut these appeals generally raise still further questions. \n\nIn sum, a range of interesting and difficult philosophical issues is\nraised by the disputes between cosmopolitans of various stripes and\ntheir critics. As the world becomes a smaller place through increased\nsocial, political, and economic contacts, these disputes and the issues\nthey raise will only become more pressing.","contact.mail":"eabrown@wustl.edu","contact.domain":"wustl.edu"}]
