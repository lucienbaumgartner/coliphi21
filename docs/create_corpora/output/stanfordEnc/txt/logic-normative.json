Similarly, we\ncriticize others for failing to appreciate (at least the more obvious)\nlogical consequences of their beliefs. In both cases there is a\nfailure to conform one’s attitudes to logical strictures. We\ngenerally take agents who fall short of the demands of logic to be\nrationally defective. This suggests that logic has a normative role to\nplay in our rational economy; it instructs us how we ought or ought\nnot to think or reason. The notion that logic has such a normative\nrole to play is deeply anchored in the way we traditionally think\nabout and teach logic. To consider just two examples, Kant\ncharacterizes what he calls “pure general” logic as\nembodying the “absolutely necessary rules of thought without\nwhich there can be no employment whatsoever of the\nunderstanding” (A52/B76), which instruct us not “how the\nunderstanding is and thinks” but “how it ought to\nproceed” (Kant 1974 [1800]: 16). Similarly, Frege, in his\nvehement opposition to the psychologistic tendencies of his time,\nclassifies logic, “like ethics” as a “normative\nscience” (Frege 1897/1979: 228), one whose laws “prescribe\nuniversally how one should think if one is to think at all”\n(Frege 1893/1903/2009: xv). This entry is concerned with the question\nas to whether the tradition and the intuitions that appear to\nunderwrite it are correct. In other words, it is concerned with the\nquestion as to whether logic has normative authority over us. And if\nit does, in what sense exactly it can be said to do so?\n\n\nBefore we can hope to make any headway with these questions a number\nof clarifications are in order. First and foremost, in asking after\nthe normative status of logic, we had better get clearer on what we\nmean by “logic”. For present purposes, I will take a logic\nto be a specification of a relation of logical consequence on a set of\ntruth-bearers. Moreover, I will assume consequence relations to\nnecessarily preserve truth in virtue of logical form. For simplicity,\nI will use “\\(\\models\\)” to denote such a consequence\nrelation. My default assumption will be to take the double turnstile\nto denote the semantic consequence relation of the classical\nfirst-order predicate calculus. But not much hangs on this. Partisans\nof other types of non-classical consequence relations may read\n“\\(\\models\\)” as referring to their preferred consequence\nrelation. \nPresumably, if logic is normative for thinking or reasoning, its\nnormative force will stem, at least in part, from the fact that truth\nbearers which act as the relata of our consequence relation and the\nbearers of other logical properties are identical to (or at least are\nvery closely related in some other way) to the objects of thinking or\nreasoning: the contents of one’s mental states or acts such as\nthe content of one’s beliefs or inferences, for example. For\npresent purposes I will assume the identity between truth-bearers and\nthe contents of our attitudes, and I will assume them to be\npropositions. \nOne may approach the question of the normativity of logic by\ntaking the notions of logical consequence and of validity to be settled\nand to then investigate how these (and perhaps related) notions\nconstrain our attitudes towards the propositions standing in various\nlogical relations to one\n another.[1]\n An alternative approach has it that logic’s normative role in\nthinking or reasoning may be partly definitive of what logic is.\nHartry Field, for one, advances an account of validity along the\nlatter lines. In his 2015, he argues that neither the standard model-\nor proof-theoretic accounts of validity nor the notion of necessary\ntruth-preservation in virtue of logical form succeed in capturing the notion of validity. More\nspecifically, neither of these approaches is capable of capturing the\nnotion of validity in a way that does justice to logical disputes,\ni.e., debates over which logical system is the correct one. On the\nstandard approaches to validity, such disputes are reduced to merely\nverbal disputes inasmuch as “validity” is defined relative\nto the system of logic in question. No one, of course, ever disputed\nthat a given classical argument form is valid relative to the notion\nof validity-in-classical logic, where as an intuitionistically valid\nargument is valid relative to the notion of validity-in-intuitionistic\nlogic. The problem is that there is no neutral notion of validity one\ncould appeal to that would enable one to make sense of logical\ndisputes as genuine debates, which, arguably, they are. What is needed\nto capture the substantive nature of these disputes, therefore, is a\nworkable non-partisan notion of validity, one that is not internal to\nany particular system of logic. The key to availing ourselves of such\nan ecumenical notion of validity, Field claims, resides in its\nconceptual role. The conceptual role of the notion of\nvalidity, in turn, is identified with the way in which a\nvalid argument normatively constrains an agent’s doxastic\nattitudes. Roughly, in the case of full belief, in accepting an\nargument as valid, the agent is bound by the norm that she ought not\nbelieve the argument’s premises while at the same time not\nbelieving its conclusion. In other words, validity’s conceptual\nrole resides (at least in part) in the normative role played by valid\narguments in reasoning. Note that Field is not proposing\nto define validity in terms of its normative role. The notion\nof validity, Field contends, is best taken to be primitive. But even\nonce we take it to be primitive, it still stands in need of\nclarification. It is this clarificatory work that is done by a\ncharacterization of validity’s conceptual role. And it is in\nthis sense that the normative role of logic is supposed to\ncharacterize the very nature of validity (understood as a notion\nshared by various distinct logics). \nIn a similar vein, John MacFarlane (2004, Other Internet Resources;\nhenceforth cited as MF2004) contends that a fuller understanding of\nhow logical consequence normatively constrains reasoning may help us\nsettle long-standing issues in the philosophy of logic, debates surrounding the\nvery nature of validity. Attempts at resolving such questions have\nbeen thwarted because of their suspect methodology: they relied on the\nunreliable (because theory-laden) testimony of our intuitions about\nvalidity. Appealing to the normative role of logic, MacFarlane hopes,\nwould give us a new angle of attack and hence a potentially better\nhandle on these vexed questions. MacFarlane, too, may therefore be\nread as suggesting that a proper account of logic’s normative\nrole in reasoning will ultimately enable us to hone in on the correct\nconception of logical consequence. As examples MacFarlane considers\nthe dispute between advocates of relevantist restrictions of the\nnotion validity and those who reject such restrictions (see entry\n relevance logic),\n and the question of the formality of logical validity (see entry\n logical consequence).  The\n hope, in other words, is that an account of the normative role of\n logic, will help us pin down the correct concept of validity. In this\n respect, then, MacFarlane’s project may be thought to be more\n ambitious than Field’s whose aim is to provide a logic-neutral\n core concept of validity in terms of its normative role. For\n MacFarlane a correct account of the normativity of logic would\n constitute a potential avenue through which logical disputes may be\n decided; for Field such an account merely renders such disputes\n intelligible and so serves as a starting point for their\n resolution.[2] \nA potential problem with approaches like Field’s and\nMacFarlane’s is that logical consequence does not appear to have\na unique normative profile that sets it apart from other, non-logical\nconsequence relations. For instance, that one ought not believe each\nmember of a set of premises while at the same time not believing (or\ndisbelieving) its conclusion, is a feature that logical consequence\nseems to share with strict implication. At least in one sense of\n“ought”, I ought to believe that this is colored, if I\nbelieve it to be red, just as much as I ought to believe \\(A\\), if I\nbelieve \\(A \\land B\\). If the general principles characterizing\nlogic’s normative role fail to discriminate logical\nconsequence among other types of consequence, we cannot identify the\nconceptual role of validity with its normative role as Field\nproposes. We cannot do so, at least, unless we impose further\nconditions to demarcate properly logical consequence (see entry\n logical constants).\n The problem discussed here was raised (albeit in a different context)\nby Harman (1986: 17–20) when he argues that logic is not\n“specially relevant to reasoning”. One response, of\ncourse, is simply to concede the point and so to simply broaden the\nscope of the inquiry: Instead of asking how logic (narrowly construed)\nnormatively constrains us, we might ask how strict implication\n(Streumer 2007) or perhaps a priori implication\n does.[3]\n A further response is that neither Field nor MacFarlane are committed\nto demarcating logic or carving out any “special” role for\nit. Their principles are left-to-right conditionals: the existence of\na logical entailment gives rise to a normative constraint on doxastic\nattitudes. One can thus question the operative notion of entailment by\nquestioning the normative constraint. This, it might reasonably be\nmaintained, is all that Field and MacFarlane need for their\npurposes. \nWe said that not much of our discussion below hinges on the choice of\none’s logic. However, while we countenanced the possibility of\ndisagreement over which logic is correct, we have simply presupposed\nthat there must be a unique correct logic. And this latter assumption\ndoes seem to bear on our question in potentially significant ways. The\nissue has yet to be explored more fully. Here I offer a number of preliminary distinctions\nand observations. \nLogical pluralists maintain that there is more than one correct logic\n(see entry on\n logical pluralism).\n Now, there are perfectly uncontroversial senses in which several distinct\nlogical systems might be thought to be equally legitimate: different\nlogical formalisms might lend themselves more or less well to\ndifferent applications, e.g., classical propositional logic may be\nused to model electric circuits, the Lambek calculus naturally models\nphrase structure grammars, and so forth. If “correct” or\n“legitimate” is merely understood as “having a\nuseful application”, monists should have no complaints about\nsuch anodyne forms of “pluralism”. The monist may happily admit that there is a vast number of systems of logic that make for\nworthy objects of study, many of which will have useful\napplications. What monists must have in mind, then, is a more demanding sense of “correctness”.\nAccording to Priest, the monist takes there to be, over and above\nquestions of local applicability, a core or “canonical”\n(Priest 2006: 196) application of logic. The canonical use of logic\nconsists in determining “what follows from what—what\npremises support what conclusion—and why” (idem). It is\nonly when the question is framed in these terms, that the full force\nof the opposition between monists and pluralists can be appreciated.\nThe monist maintains that there is but one logic fit to play this core\nrole; the pluralist insists that several logics have an equally good\nclaim to playing it. \nOne consequence of pluralism, then, is that in a dispute between\nadvocates of different logics both of which lay claim to being the\ncorrect logic in this sense—say, a dispute between a classical\nlogician and an advocate of intuitionistic logic—neither party\nto the dispute needs to be at fault. Each logic may be equally\nlegitimate. For this to be possible, it must be the case that even the\ncanonical application of logic can be realized in multiple ways.\nPluralists differ in the accounts they offer of this multiple\nrealizability. One\ninfluential such account has been advanced by J.C. Beall and Greg\nRestall (2005). According to their account, several logics may be\nequally qualified to fulfill the core function of logic, because “logical consequence” admits of several distinct interpretations (within a specified range). Roughly, \\(A\\) is a logical consequence of a set of formulas \\(\\Gamma\\) if and\nonly if, in every case in which all of the members of \\(\\Gamma\\) are\ntrue, so is \\(A\\). Depending on how we understand “case”\nin our definition—e.g., as Tarskian models (classical logic),\nstages (intuitionistic logic), situations (relevant logic),\netc.—we arrive at different concepts of logical consequence. \nWhat does this mean for the question of logic’s normative\nstatus? It follows that it is only once we choose to disambiguate\n“logical consequence” in a particular way—as classical or\nintuitionistic, say—that the normative import of that particular\nconception of consequence makes itself felt. After all, on the\npluralist picture a given conception of consequence cannot be\nnormatively binding in virtue of being (uniquely) correct, i.e., in\nvirtue of being descriptively adequate with respect to the entailment\nfacts, as it were. Hence, if I opt for an intuitionistic conception of\nconsequence and you go in for a classical one, I have no grounds for\ncriticizing your move from, say, \\(\\neg \\neg A\\) to \\(A\\), save\nperhaps pragmatic ones. To be sure, such a move would be impermissible\naccording to my preferred notion of consequence, but it is perfectly\nacceptable according to yours. According to the pluralist, then, there\nexists no absolute sense, but only system-relative senses, in which a\nlogic can normatively bind us. Pluralism about logic thus seems to give rise\nto pluralism about logical normativity: If there are several equally\nlegitimate consequence relations, there are also several equally legitimate sets of logical norms. Consequently, it is hard to see prima\nfacie how substantive normative conflicts can arise. If the consequence\nrelations of classical and intuitionistic logic are equally\nlegitimate, there is little to disagree about when it comes to the\nnorms they induce. The classicist and the intuitionist simply have\nopted to play by different rules. \nThis line of thought leads to a potential worry, however. For logical\nnorms do not merely bind us in the way that the rules of a game bind\nus. I hold myself to be answerable to the rules governing a game\n(of chess, say) so long as I wish to participate in it. However, the\nnormativity of logic does not seem to be optional in the same way. The\nnorms of logic are themselves responsible to our broader epistemic\naims (and would thus need to be coordinated with other epistemic\nnorms). Hence, if my epistemic aim is, say, acquiring true beliefs\n(and avoiding false ones), this may give me a reason to prefer one set\nof logical norms over another. For imagine I could choose either of\ntwo logics \\(L_{1}\\) and \\(L_{2}\\). Suppose, moreover, that \\(A\\) is\ntrue and that \\(A \\models_{L_{1}} B\\) but \\(A \\not \\models_{L_{2}}\nB\\), for some relevant proposition \\(B\\). Even according to Beall and\nRestall, not all logics are equal. To pass muster, a logic must\nsatisfy certain core conditions. In particular, it must be\ntruth-preserving. Assuming that both \\(L_{1}\\) and \\(L_{2}\\) are\ntruth-preserving, it follows that \\(B\\) is true. But then it would\nseem that there is a clear sense in which \\(L_{1}\\) outperforms\n\\(L_{2}\\) in terms of the guidance it affords us. According to the\nnorms \\(L_{2}\\) gives rise to, there is presumably nothing amiss about\nan agent who believes \\(A\\) but not \\(B\\); according to \\(L_{1}\\)\nthere presumably is. Hence, \\(L_{1}\\) is more conducive to our\nepistemic aims. It follows that whenever two putatively equally\ncorrect logics, \\(L_{1}\\) and \\(L_{2}\\) are such that \\(L_{2}\\) is a\nproper sub-system of \\(L_{1}\\), one would appear to have reason to opt\nfor \\(L_{1}\\) since it is more conducive to one’s aim of having\ntrue beliefs. In cases where we are dealing with two logics \\(L_{1}\\)\nand \\(L_{2}\\) such that \\(\\models_{L_{1}}\\) and \\(\\models_{L_{2}}\\)\nare not sub-relations of one another, things may be more complicated.\nAll the same, even in such cases, it may well be that our overarching\nepistemic aims and norms give us reason to prefer one logic over\nanother, and hence that from the standpoint of these epistemic aims,\nthe logics are not equally good after all. The aim of these\nconsiderations is not to undermine forms of logical pluralism like the\none advanced by Beall and Restall, but merely to point out that once\nwe take the normative dimension of logic into account, we must also\nreckon with the broader epistemic goals, which the norms of logic\nmay be thought to be subservient to. \nField (2009b) argues for a different form of logical pluralism, one\nwhich leaves more room for normative conflict. Logical pluralism is\nnot, for Field, the result of ambiguity in our notion of logical\nconsequence. Rather, it has its source in non-factualism of epistemic\nnorms. His non-factualism, in turn, is fueled partly by general\nconcerns, partly by the nature of how we choose such norms. Among the\ngeneral concerns Field (2009c) mentions are Hume-style worries about\nthe impossibility of integrating irreducible normative facts into a\nnaturalistic world view, Benacerraf-style worries about our ability to\ngain epistemic access to such facts, and Mackie-style worries about\nthe “queerness” of such facts (i.e., that they not only\nappear to have no room within our scientific picture of the world, but\nthat, furthermore, they are supposed to have a somewhat mysterious\nmotivational pull to them). The latter issue of norm selection amounts\nto this. Given a set of epistemic goals, we evaluate candidate norms\nas better or worse depending how well they promote those goals.\nAccording to Field, we have no reason to assume that there should be a\nfact of the matter as to which choice of logic is the uniquely correct\none; there will typically not be a unique system that best optimizes\nour (often competing) constraints. \nThat being said, it seems that we can sensibly engage in rational\ndebates over which logic to adopt in the light of various issues\n(vagueness, the semantic paradoxes, etc.). Consequently, there is a\nclear sense in which normative conflicts do arise. Now, since Field\ntakes it to be an essential component of the notion of logical\nconsequence that it should induce norms (Field 2009a,b, 2015), we\nchoose a logic by finding out which logical norms it makes most sense\nfor us to adopt. But because Field does not take there to be a fact of\nthe matter as to which set of norms is correct and since the question\nas to which of the norms best promotes our epistemic ends is often\nunderdetermined, we may expect there to be several candidate sets of\nlogical norms all of which are equally well-motivated. We are thus\nleft with a (more modest) form of logical pluralism on our hands. \nWhat both of these types of pluralism have in common from the\npoint of view of the question of the normativity of logic, though, is\ntheir rejection of the view that logical norms might impose themselves\nupon us simply as a result of the correctness of the corresponding\nlogical principles. As such, pluralist views stand diametrically\nopposed to realist forms of monism such as the one championed by Gila\nSher (2011). According to Sher, logical principles are grounded,\nultimately, in “formal laws” and so in reality. It is\nthese formal laws that ultimately also ground the corresponding\nlogical\n norms.[4] \nNext let us ask what it is that logic is normative for, if indeed it\nis normative. The paradigmatic objects of normative appraisal are\nactions, behaviors or practices. What, then, is the activity or\npractice that logical norms apply to? \nOne response—perhaps the most common one—is that logic\nsets forth norms for (theoretical) reasoning. Unlike\nthinking, which might consist merely of disconnected sequences of\nconceptual activity, reasoning is presumably a connected, usually\ngoal-directed, process by which we form, reinstate or revise doxastic\nattitudes (and perhaps other types of states) through inference.\nConsider the following two examples of how logic might give rise to\nnorms. First, suppose I am trying to find Ann and that I can be sure\nthat Ann is either in the museum or at the concert. I am now reliably\ninformed that she is not in the museum. Using logic, I conclude that\nAnn is at the concert. Thus, by inferring in conformity with the valid\n(by the standards of classical logic) logical principle of disjunctive\nsyllogism, I have arrived at a true belief about Ann’s\nwhereabouts. Second, if I believe that Ann is either at the concert or\nthe museum, while at the same time disbelieving both of the disjuncts,\nit would seem that there is a tension in my belief set, which I have\nreason to rectify by revising my beliefs appropriately. Logic may thus\nbe thought to normatively constrain the ways we form and revise\ndoxastic attitudes. And it does so, presumably, in our everyday\ncognitive lives (as in our example), as well as in the context of more\nself-conscious forms of theoretical inquiry, as in mathematics, the\nsciences, law, philosophy and so on, where its normative grip on us\nwould seem to be even\n tighter.[5] \nOther philosophers have taken the normativity of logic to kick in at\nan even more fundamental level. According to them, the normative force\nof logic does not merely constrain reasoning, it applies to all\nthinking. The thesis deserves our attention both because of its\nhistorical interest—it has been attributed in various ways to\nKant, Frege and\n Carnap[6]—and\n because of its connections to contemporary views in epistemology and\nthe philosophy of mind (see Cherniak 1986: §2.5; Goldman 1986:\nCh. 13; Milne 2009; as well as the references below). \nTo get a better handle on the thesis in question, let us agree to\nunderstand “thought” broadly as conceptual\n activity.[7]\n Judging, believing, inferring, for example, are all instances of\nthinking in this sense. It may seem puzzling at first how logic is to\nget a normative grip on thinking: Why merely by engaging in\nconceptual activity should one automatically be answerable to the\nstrictures of\n logic?[8]\n After all, at least on the picture of thought we are currently\nconsidering, any disconnected stream-of-consciousness of imaginings\nqualifies as thinking. One answer is that logic is thought to put\nforth norms that are constitutive for thinking. That is, in order for\na mental episode to count as an episode of thinking at all, it must,\nin a sense to be made precise, be “assessable in light of the\nlaws of logic” (MacFarlane 2002: 37). Underlying this thesis is\na distinction between two types of rules or norms: constitutive ones\nand regulative ones. \nThe distinction between regulative and constitutive norms is Kantian\nat root (KRV A179/B222). Here, however, I refer primarily to a related\ndistinction due to John Searle. According to Searle, regulative norms\n“regulate antecedently or independently existing forms of\nbehavior”, such as rules of etiquette or traffic laws.\nConstitutive norms, by contrast \ncreate or define new forms of behavior. The rules of football or\nchess, for example, do not merely regulate playing football or chess\nbut as it were they create the very possibility of playing such games.\n(Searle 1969: 33–34; see also Searle 2010: 97) \nTake the case of traffic\n rules.[9]\n While I ought to abide by traffic rules in normal circumstances, I\ncan choose to ignore them. Of course, rowdy driving in violation of\nthe traffic code might well get me in trouble. Yet no matter how\ncavalier my attitude towards traffic laws is, my activity still counts\nas driving. Contrast this with the rules governing the game of chess.\nI cannot in the same way opt out of conforming to the rules of chess\nwhile continuing to count as playing chess; in systematically\nviolating the rules of chess and persisting in doing so even in the\nface of criticism, I forfeit my right to count as partaking in the\nactivity of playing chess. Unless one’s moves are appropriately\nassessable in light of the rules of chess, one’s activity\ndoes not qualify as playing chess. \nAccording to the constitutive conception of logic’s normativity\nthe principles of logic are to thought what the rules of chess are to\nthe game of chess: I cannot persistently fail to acknowledge that the\nlaws of logic set standards of correctness for my thinking without\nthereby jeopardizing my status as a thinker (i.e., someone presently\nengaged in the act of thinking). \nTwo important clarifications are in order. For one, on its most\nplausible reading, the thesis of the constitutive normativity of logic\nfor thought must be understood so as to leave room for the possibility\nof logical error: an agent’s mental activity may continue to\ncount as thinking, despite his committing logical\n blunders.[10] \nThat is, although one may at times (perhaps even frequently and\nsystematically) stray from the path prescribed by logic in one’s\nthinking, one nevertheless counts as a thinker provided one\nappropriately acknowledges logic’s normative authority over\none’s thinking. Consider again the game of chess. In violating\nthe rules of chess, deliberately or out of ignorance, I can plausibly\nstill be said to count as playing chess, so long, at least, as I\nacknowledge that my activity is answerable to the rules; for example,\nby being disposed to correct myself when an illegal move is brought to\nmy\n attention.[11]\n Similarly, all that is necessary to count as a thinker is to be\nsensitive to the fact that my practice of judging, inferring,\nbelieving, etc., is normatively constrained by the laws of logic. It\nis not easy to specify, in any detail, what the requisite\nacknowledgment or sensitivity consists in. A reasonable starting\npoint, however, is provided by William Taschek who, in his\ninterpretation of Frege, proposes that acknowledging \nthe categorical authority of logic will involve one’s possessing\na capacity to recognize—when being sincere and reflective, and\npossibly with appropriate prompting—logical mistakes both in\none’s own judgmental and inferential practice and that of others.\n(Taschek 2008: 384) \nA second point of clarification is that the agent need not be able to\nexplicitly represent to herself the logical norms by which she is\nbound. For instance, it may be that my reasoning ought to conform to\ndisjunctive syllogism in appropriate ways. I may be able to display\nthe right kind of sensitivity to the principle by which I am bound\n(with the right prompting if need be), without my having to possess\nthe conceptual resources to entertain the metalogical proposition that\n\\(\\neg A, A\\lor B \\models B\\). Nor must I otherwise explicitly\nrepresent that proposition and the normative constraint to which it\ngives rise. \nWith these clarifications in place, let us turn to a central\npresupposition of the approach I have been sketching. What is being\npresupposed, of course, is a conception of thinking that does not\nreduce to brute psychological or neurophysiological processes or\nevents. If this naturalistic level of description were the only one\navailable, the constitutive account of the normativity of logic would\nbe a non-starter. What is being presupposed, therefore, is the\npermissibility of irreducibly normative levels of descriptions of our\nmental lives. In particular, it is assumed that the boundary between\nthe kinds of mental activity that constitute thinking and other kinds\nof mental activity (non-conceptual activity like being in pain, for\ninstance) is a boundary best characterizable in normative terms. This\nis not to deny that much can be learned about mental phenomena through\ndescriptions that operate at different, non-normative levels—the\n“symbolic” or the neurological level of description,\nsay—the claim is merely that if we are interested in demarcating\nconceptual activity from other types of mental phenomena, we should\nlook to the constitutive norms governing it. Davidson (1980, 1984),\nDennett (1987), and Millar (2004) all hold views according to which\nhaving concepts and hence thinking requires that the agent be\ninterpretable as at least minimally sensitive to logical norms. Also,\ncertain contemporary “normativist approaches” according to which\naccounts of certain intentional states involve ineliminable appeals to\nnormative concepts may advocate the constitutive conception of logic’s normativity\n(e.g., Wedgwood 2007, 2009; Zangwill 2005). \nSo far the answers to the question “What is logic normative\nfor?” we considered had in common that the “activities” in\nquestion—reasoning and thinking—are internal, mental\nprocesses of individual agents. But logic also seems to exert\nnormative force on the external manifestations of these\nprocesses—for instance, it codifies the standards to which we\nhold ourselves in our practices of assertion, rational dialogue and\nthe like. While much of the literature on the normativity of logic\nfocuses on internal processes of individuals, some authors have\ninstead emphasized logic’s role as a purveyor of public standards for normatively regulated practices. \nTake the practice of asserting. Assertion is often said to “aim\nat truth” (or knowledge, Williamson 2000: Ch. 11) as well as\nbeing a “matter of putting forward propositions for others to\nuse as evidence in the furtherance of their epistemic projects”\n(Milne 2009: 282). Since I take the asserted propositions to be true\nand since truths entail further truths, I am “committed to\nstanding by” the logical consequences of my assertions or else\nto retract them if I am unable to meet challenges to my assertion or\nits consequences. Similarly, if the set of propositions I assert is\ninconsistent at least one of my assertions must fall short of being\ntrue and the set as a whole cannot be regarded as part of my evidence.\nPlausibly, therefore, logic does have a normative role to play in\ngoverning the practice of assertion. \nPeter Milne takes an interest in assertion mainly in order to\n“work back” from there to how logic constrains belief. He\nconcludes that logic exerts normative force at least on the stock of\nbeliefs that constitute the agent’s evidence (Milne 2009: 286).\nOther authors explicitly prioritize the external dimension of\nreasoning, conceived of as a social, inter-personal phenomenon.\nAccording to them, it is reasoning in this external sense (as opposed\nto intra-personal processes of belief revision, etc.) that is the\nprimary locus of logical normativity (MacKenzie 1989). The norms\ngovern our rational interactions with our peers. For instance, they\nmight be thought to codify the permissions and obligations governing\ncertain kinds of dialogues. Viewed from this perspective,\nlogic’s normative impact on the intra-personal activity of\nreasoning is merely derivative, arrived at through a process of\ninteriorization. A view along these lines has been advanced by\nCatarina Dutilh Novaes (2015). In a similar vein Sinan Dogramaci\n(2012, 2015) has proposed a view he calls “epistemic\ncommunism”. According to epistemic communism our use of\n“rational” applied to certain deductive rules has a\nspecific functional role. Its role is to coordinate our epistemic\nrules with a view to maximizing the efficiency of our communal\nepistemic practices. On the basis of this view, he then elaborates an\nargument for the pessimistic conclusion that no general theory of\nrationality is to be had. \nWe will here follow the bulk of the literature in asking after the\nnormative role logic might play in reasoning understood as an\nintra-personal activity. Yet, much of the discussion to follow applies\nmutatis mutandis to the other approaches. \nDespite its venerable pedigree and its intuitive force, the thesis that\nlogic should have a normative role to play in reasoning has not gone\nunchallenged. Gilbert Harman’s criticisms have been particularly\ninfluential. Harman’s skeptical challenge is rooted in a\ndiagnosis: our deep-seated intuition that logic has a special\nnormative connection with reasoning is rooted in a confusion. We have\nconflated two very different kinds of enterprises, viz. that of\nformulating a theory of deductive logic, on the one hand, and what\nHarman calls “a theory of reasoning” (Harman 2002) on the other. Begin\nwith the latter. A theory of reasoning is a normative account about\nhow ordinary agents should go about forming, revising and maintaining\ntheir beliefs. Its aim is to formulate general guidelines as to which\nmental actions (judgments and inferences) to perform in which\ncircumstances and which beliefs to adopt or to abandon (Harman 2009:\n333). As such, the subject matter of a theory of reasoning are the\ndynamic “psychological events or processes” that\nconstitute reasoning. In contrast, “the sort of implication and\nargument studied in deductive logic have to do with [static,\nnon-psychological] relations among propositions” (idem). Consequently,  \nlogical principles are not directly rules of belief revision.\nThey are not particularly about belief [or the other mental states and\nacts that constitute reasoning] at all. (Harman 1984: 107)  \nOnce we disabuse ourselves of this confusion, Harman maintains, it is\nhard to see how the resulting gap between logic and reasoning can be\nbridged. This is Harman’s challenge. \nAt least two lines of response come to mind. One reaction to\nHarman’s skeptical challenge is to take issue with his way of\nsetting up the problem. In particular, we might reject his explanation of the provenance\nof our intuitions to the effect that logic has a normative role to\nplay in reasoning as stemming from a mistaken identification of\ndeductive logic and theories of reasoning. It might be thought, for\ninstance, that Harman is led to exaggerate the gulf between deductive\nlogic and theories of reasoning as a result of a\ncontestable—because overly narrow—conception of either\nlogic or reasoning, or both. Advocates of broadly logical accounts of\nbelief revision (belief revision theories, non-monotonic logics,\ndynamic doxastic logic, etc.) may feel that Harman is driven to his\nskepticism out of a failure to consider more sophisticated logical\ntools. Unlike standard first-order classical logic, some of these\nformalisms do make explicit mention of beliefs (and possibly other\nmental states). Some formalisms do seek to capture the dynamic\ncharacter of reasoning in which beliefs are not merely accumulated but\nmay also be revised. Harman’s response, it would seem (Harman\n1986: 6), is that such formalisms either tacitly rely on mistaken\nassumptions about the normative role of logic or else fall short of\ntheir objectives in other ways. But even if one disagrees with\nHarman’s assessment, one can still agree that such formal\nmodels of belief revision do not obviate the need for a philosophical\naccount of the normativity of logic. That is because such models do typically tacitly rely on assumptions concerning the normative role of logic. An account of the normativity of logic would thus afford us a fuller\nunderstanding of the presuppositions that undergird such theories. \nOn the other hand, some philosophers—externalists of various\nstripes, for instance—may find fault with the epistemological\npresuppositions underlying Harman’s conception of a theory of\nreasoning. Harman views the aim of epistemology as closely linked to\nhis project of providing a theory of reasoning. According to\nHarman’s “general conservatism”, central\nepistemological notions, like that of justification are approached\nfrom the first-personal standpoint: “general conservatism is a\nmethodological principle, offering methodological advice of a sort a\nperson can take” (Harman 2010: 154). As such Harman's approach contrasts with much of\ncontemporary epistemology which, unconcerned with direct epistemic\nadvice, is mainly in the business of seeking to lay down explanatorily\nilluminating necessary and sufficient conditions for epistemic\n justification.[12]\n Summarizing the first line of response, then, Harman's skepticism is partly premised on particular conceptions of logic and of epistemological methodology both of which may be called into question. \nThe second line of response is to (largely) accept Harman’s\nassumptions regarding the natures of deductive logic and of epistemology\nbut to try to meet his challenge by showing that there is a\ninteresting normative link between the two after all. In what follows, I focus\nprimarily on this second line of response. \nOf course, saying that deductive logic and theories of reasoning are\ndistinct is one thing, affirming that there could not be an\ninteresting normative connection between them is quite another. As a\nfirst stab at articulating such a connection, we might try the\nfollowing simple line of thought: theoretical reasoning aims to\nprovide an accurate representation of the world. We accurately\nrepresent the world by having true (or perhaps knowledgeable) beliefs\nand by avoiding false ones. But our doxastic states have\ncontents—propositions—and these contents stand in certain\nlogical relations to one another. Having an awareness of these logical\nrelations would appear to be conducive to the end of having true\nbeliefs and so is relevant to theoretical reasoning. In particular,\nthe logical notions of consequence and consistency seem to be relevant.\nIf I believe truly, the truth of my belief will carry over to its\nlogical consequences. Conversely, if my belief entails a falsehood it\ncannot be true. Similarly, if the set of propositions I believe (in\ngeneral or in a particular domain) is inconsistent, they cannot\npossibly afford an accurate representation of the world; at least one\nof my beliefs must be false. Harman may be able to agree with all of this. His\nskepticism pertains also (and perhaps primarily) to the question whether logic has a privileged role to play in reasoning; that the principles of logic are relevant to reasoning in a way that principles of other sciences are not (Harman 1986: 20). However, I want to set this further issue to one side for now. \nNotice that this simple reflection on the connection between logic and\nnorms of reasoning leads us right back to the basic intuitions at the beginning of this entry: that there is something wrong with us when\nwe hold inconsistent beliefs or when we fail to endorse the logical\nconsequences of our beliefs (at least when we can be expected to be\naware of them). Let us spell these intuitions out by way of the following two principles. Let \\(S\\) be an agent and \\(P\\)\na\n proposition.[13] \nLogical implication principle (IMP): If \\(S\\)’s beliefs\nlogically imply \\(A\\), then \\(S\\) ought to believe that\n\\(A\\). \nLogical consistency principle (CON): \\(S\\) ought to avoid having\nlogically inconsistent beliefs. \nNotice that on the face of it\n IMP\n and\n CON\n are distinct.\n IMP,\n in and of itself, does not prohibit inconsistent or even\ncontradictory beliefs, all it requires is that my beliefs be closed\nunder logical consequence.\n CON,\n on the other hand, does not require that I believe the consequences\nof the propositions I believe, it merely demands that the set of\npropositions I believe be consistent. However, given certain\nassumptions,\n IMP\n does entail\n CON.\n Against the background of classical logic, the entailment obtains\nprovided we allow the following two assumptions: (i) one cannot (and,\nvia the principle that “ought” implies “can”,\nought not) both believe and disbelieve one and the same\nproposition simultaneously; and (ii) that disbelieving a proposition is\ntantamount to believing its\n negation.[14]\n For let \\(\\{ A_{1}, \\dots, A_{n}\\}\\) be \\(S\\)’s inconsistent\nbelief set. By classical logic, we have \\(A_{1}, \\dots, A_{n-1}\\models\n\\neg A_{n}\\). Since \\(S\\)’s beliefs are closed under logical\nconsequence, \\(S\\) believes \\(\\neg A_{n}\\) and hence, by (ii), disbelieves \\(A_{n}\\). So, \\(S\\) both believes and\ndisbelieves \\(A_{n}\\). \n\n IMP\n and\n CON\n are thus a first—if rather flatfooted—attempt at pinning\ndown the elusive normative connection between logic and norms of\nreasoning. Harman considers these responses and responds in turn. The\nfollowing four objections against our provisional principles can, in\nlarge part, be found in the writings of Harman. \n(1) Suppose I believe \\(p\\) and \\(p \\supset q\\) (as well as Modus\nPonens). The mere fact that I have these beliefs and that I recognize\nthem to jointly entail \\(q\\) does not normatively compel any\nparticular attitude towards \\(q\\) on my part. In particular, it is not\nthe case in general that I ought to come to believe \\(q\\) as\n IMP\n would have it. After all, \\(q\\) may be at odds with my evidence in\nwhich case it may be unreasonable for me to slavishly follow Modus\nPonens and to form a belief in \\(q\\). The rational course of\n“action”, rather, when \\(q\\) is untenable, is for me to\nrelinquish my belief in at least one of my antecedent beliefs \\(p\\)\nand \\(p \\supset q\\) on account of their unpalatable implications.\nThus, logical principles do not invariably offer reliable guidance in\ndeciding what to believe (at least, when the relation between logical\nprinciples and our practices of belief-formation are understood along\nthe lines of\n IMP).\n Let us therefore call this the Objection from Belief Revision. \nJohn Broome (2000: 85) offers a closely related objection, which\nnevertheless deserves separate mention. Broome observes that any\nproposition trivially entails itself. From\n IMP\n it thus follows that I ought to believe any proposition I in\nfact believe. But this seems patently false: I might hold any number\nof irresponsibly acquired beliefs. The fact that, by mere\nhappenstance, I hold these beliefs, in no way implies that I ought to\nbelieve them. Call this variation of the Objection from Belief Revision, the\nBootstrapping Objection. \n(2) A further worry is that a reasoner with limited cognitive\nresources would be unreasonable to abide by\n IMP\n because she would be obligated to form countless utterly useless\nbeliefs. Any of the propositions I believe entails an\ninfinite number of propositions that are of no interest to me\nwhatsoever. Not only do I not care about, say, the disjunction\n“I am wearing blue socks or pigs can fly” entailed by my\ntrue belief that I am wearing blue socks, it would be positively\nirrational of me to squander my scarce cognitive resources of time,\ncomputational power and storage capacity in memory and so on, on idly deriving implications of\nmy beliefs when these are of no value to me. Harman fittingly dubs the\nprinciple of reasoning in question Principle of Clutter\nAvoidance. Let us call the corresponding objection the\nObjection from Clutter Avoidance. \n(3) There is another sense in which both\n principles—IMP\n and\n CON—place\n excessive demands on agents whose resources are limited. Consider the\nfollowing example. Suppose I believe the axioms of Peano arithmetic.\nSuppose further that a counterintuitive arithmetical proposition that\nis of great interest to me is entailed by the axioms, but that its\nshortest proof has more steps than there are protons in the visible\nuniverse. According to\n IMP,\n I ought to believe the proposition in question. However, if the\nlogical “ought” implies “can” (relative to \ncapacities even remotely like our own),\n IMP\n cannot be correct. An analogous objection can be leveled at\n CON.\n An agent may harbor an inconsistent belief set, yet detecting the\ninconsistency may be too difficult for any ordinary agent. We may summarize\nthese objections under the label Objection from Excessive Demands. \n(4) Finally, I may find myself in epistemic circumstances in which\ninconsistency is not merely excusable on account of my “finitary\npredicament” (Cherniak 1986), but where inconsistency appears to\nbe rationally required. Arguably, the Preface Paradox constitutes such\na scenario (Makinson\n 1965).[15]\n Here is one standard way of presenting it. Suppose I author a\nmeticulously researched non-fiction book. My book is composed of a\nlarge set of non-trivial propositions \\(p_{1},\\dots, p_{n}\\). Seeing\nthat all of my claims are the product of scrupulous research, I have\nevery reason firmly to believe each of the \\(p_{i}\\) individually. But\nI also have overwhelming inductive evidence for \\(q\\): that at least\none of my beliefs is in error. The \\(p_{i}\\) and \\(q\\) cannot be\njointly true since \\(q\\) is equivalent to the negation of the\nconjunction of the \\(p_{i}\\). Yet, it would seem irrational to abandon\nany of my beliefs for the sake of regaining consistency, at least in\nthe absence of any new evidence. The Preface Paradox thus may be\nthought to tell against\n CON:\n arguably, I may be within my rational rights in holding inconsistent\nbeliefs (at least in certain contexts). However, it also seems to\nconstitute a direct counterexample to\n IMP.\n For in the Preface scenario I believe each of the \\(p_{i}\\) and yet\nit looks as if I ought to disbelieve an obvious logical consequence\nthereof: their conjunction (because \\(q\\) is transparently equivalent\nto \\(\\neg (p_{1} \\land \\dots \\land p_{n})\\)). \nSo much for the objections to\n IMP\n and\n CON.\n The question raised by these considerations is whether these principles can be improved upon. \nLet us focus on\n IMP\n for now. Harman’s objections establish that\n IMP—in\n its current form, at least—is untenable. The question is\nwhether\n IMP\n can be improved upon in a way that is invulnerable to Harman’s\nobjections. In other words, the question is whether a tenable version\nof what MacFarlane (MF2004) calls a bridge principle is to be\nhad. A bridge principle, in this context, is a general principle that\narticulates a substantive relation between “facts” about\nlogical consequence (or perhaps an agent’s attitudes towards\nsuch facts) on the one hand, and norms governing the agent’s\ndoxastic attitudes vis-à-vis the propositions standing\nin these logical relations on the other.\n IMP\n is a bridge principle, albeit not a promising one. \nHarman’s skepticism about the normativity of logic can thus be\nunderstood as skepticism as to whether a serviceable bridge principle\nis to be had. In order properly to adjudicate whether Harman’s\nskepticism is justified, we need to know what “the options\nare”. But how? John MacFarlane (MF2004) offers a helpful taxonomy of bridge principles which constitutes a very good\nfirst approximation of the range of options. This section briefly\nsummarizes MacFarlane’s classification, as well as subsequent\ndevelopments in the literature. \nLet us begin with a general blue print for constructing bridge\n principles:[16] \nA bridge principle thus takes the form of a material conditional. The\nconditional’s antecedent states “facts” about\nlogical consequence (or attitudes toward such “facts”).\nIts consequent contains a (broadly) normative claim concerning the\nagent’s doxastic attitudes towards the relevant propositions.\nDoxastic attitudes, as I use the term, include belief, disbelief, and\ndegree of\n belief.[17]\n Here \\(\\alpha\\) may (but need not) represent the same attitude as\n\\(\\beta\\). In fact, for principles with negative polarity, it may\nrepresent the negation of an attitude: “do not disbelieve the\nconclusion, if you believe the premises”. \nIn what ways, now, can we vary this schema so as to generate the space\nof possible bridge principles? MacFarlane introduces three parameters\nalong which the schema may be varied. Each parameter allows for\nmultiple “discrete settings”. We can think of the logical\nspace of bridge principles as the range of possible combinations among\nthese parameter settings. \nIn order to express the normative claims, we will need deontic\nvocabulary. Bridge principles may differ in the deontic operator they\ndeploy: does the normative constraint take the form of an\nought (o), a permission (p) or merely of having (defeasible)\nreason (r)? \nWhat is the polarity of the normative claim? Is it a\npositive obligation/permission/reason to believe a\ncertain proposition given one’s belief in a number of premises (+)? Or rather is it a\nnegative obligation/prohibition/reason not to\ndisbelieve (−)? \nWhat is the scope of the deontic operator? Different bridge principles\nresult from varying the scope of the deontic operator. Let \\(O\\) stand\ngenerically for one of the above deontic operators. Given that the\nconsequent of a bridge principle will typically itself take the form\nof a conditional, the operator can take \nThese three parameters admit of a total of eighteen combinations of\ntheir settings and hence eighteen bridge principles. The symbols in\nparentheses associated with each parameter setting combine to\ndetermine a unique label for each of the principles: The first letter\nindicates the scope of the deontic operator (C, W or B), the second\nletter indicates the type of deontic operator (o[bligation],\np[ermissions], r[easons]) and the “+” or\n“−” indicate positive and negative polarity\n respectively.[19]\n For example, the label “Co+” corresponds to our original\nprinciple\n IMP: \nIf \\(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\dots, A_{n} \\models C\\), then if \\(S\\) believes\n\\(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\dots, A_{n}\\), \\(S\\) ought to believe\n\\(C\\). \nAnd “Wr−” designates: \nIf \\(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\dots, A_{n} \\models C\\), then \\(S\\) has reason to\n(believe \\(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\dots, A_{n}\\), only if \\(S\\) does not\ndisbelieve \\(C\\)). \nMany will regard the bridge principles we have presented thus far to\nbe problematic. They all relate “facts” about logical\nentailment—assuming there are such things—to certain\nnormative constraints on the agent’s attitudes. The trouble, they will say, is\nthat these principles are not sensitive to the cognitive limitations\nof ordinary agents. Agents, if they are even remotely like us, are not\napprised of all entailment “facts”. Consequently,\nespecially the “ought”-based principles (at least on some\nunderstanding of “ought”) are therefore vulnerable to\nHarman’s\n Objection from Excessive Demands. \nA natural response is to consider attitudinal bridge principles.  I\ncall attitudinal bridge principles whose antecedents are\nrestricted to logical implications to which the agent bears an\nattitude. For instance, to take the type of attitudinal principle\nconsidered by MacFarlane, Co+ may be transformed into: \nAccording to (Co+k), the agent’s belief set ought to be closed\nonly under known logical consequence. Let us call this an\nattitudinally constrained or, more specifically, the\nepistemically constrained variant of Co+ (whence the\n“k” in the label). Different authors may go in for\ndifferent types of attitudes. Knowledge, of course, is a factive\nattitude. Some will wish to leave room for the possibility of\n(systematic) logical error. For instance, an agent might mistakenly\ncomply with the principle \\(A\\supset B, B \\models A\\). Perhaps even\nsomeone with erroneous logical convictions such as this should, for\nthe sake of internal coherence, comply with the principles he deems\ncorrect. An agent who sincerely took an erroneous principle to be\ncorrect but failed to reason in accordance with it may be seen to\nmanifest a greater degree of irrationality than someone who at least\nconformed to principles he endorses. But we can also imagine more\ninteresting cases of systematic error. Suppose I am impressed with an\nargument for a particular non-classical logic as a means of parrying\nthe semantic paradoxes. I thus come to espouse the logic in question\nand begin to manage my doxastic attitudes accordingly. But now suppose\nin addition that unbeknownst to me the arguments that persuaded me are\nnot in fact sound. Again, it might be thought that though I am\nmistaken in my adherence to the logic, so long as I had good reasons\nto espouse it, it may nevertheless be proper for me to comply with its\nprinciples. If logical error in either of these two senses is to be\naccommodated, the appropriate attitude would have to be\nnon-factive. \nA further issue is that ordinary agents are presumably normatively\nbound by logical principles without being able to articulate or\nrepresent those principles to themselves explicitly. Assuming\notherwise runs the risk of overly intellectualizing our ability to\nconform to logical norms. The attitudes borne by such logically\nuntrained agents to the logical principles therefore presumably are\nnot belief-like. Perhaps such agents are better thought of as\nexercising an ability or having a disposition to take certain forms of\nentailment to be correct. See Corine Besson 2012 for a criticism of\ndispositionalist accounts of logical competence, and Murzi &\nSteinberger 2013 for a partial defense. \nHaving thus outlined the classificatory scheme, a number of additional\ncomments are in order. Notice that disbelieving \\(A\\) is to be\ndistinguished from not believing \\(A\\). One cannot rationally believe\nand disbelieve the same proposition (although see\n note 12).\n Hence, I ought to ensure that when I disbelieve \\(A\\), I do not\nbelieve \\(A\\). The converse, however, obviously does not hold since I\ncan fail to believe \\(A\\) without actively disbelieving it. I may, for\ninstance, choose to suspend my judgment as to whether \\(A\\) pending\nfurther evidence, or I may simply never have considered whether \\(A\\).\nFurthermore, I will remain neutral on the question as to whether the\nattitude of disbelieving \\(A\\) should be identified with that of\nbelieving \\(\\neg A\\). \nMoreover, a note on deontic modals is in order. “You ought not\n\\(\\Phi\\)” (\\(O\\neg \\Phi\\)) is not the same as saying “It\nis not the case that you ought to \\(\\Phi\\)” (\\(\\neg O \\Phi\\)).\nBut rather “You are forbidden from \\(\\Phi\\)ing”.\nConsequently, “You ought not disbelieve \\(A\\)” should be\nread as “disbelieving \\(A\\) would be a mistake”, as\nopposed to “it is not the case that you ought to disbelieve\n\\(A\\)”, which is compatible with the permissibility of\ndisbelieving \\(A\\). \nOught and may are understood to be strict notions. By contrast,\nreason is a pro tanto or contributory notion. Having\nreason to \\(\\Phi\\) is compatible with simultaneously having reason not\nto \\(\\Phi\\) and indeed with it being the case that I ought not to\n\\(\\Phi\\). Reasons, unlike oughts, may be weighed against each\nother; the side that wins out determines what ought to be done.\nFinally, I am here treating all deontic modals as propositional\noperators. This too is not uncontroversial. Peter Geach (1982) and\nmore recently Mark Schroeder (2011) have argued that so-called\ndeliberative or practical oughts are best analyzed not as\noperators acting on propositions but rather as expressing relations\nbetween agents and actions. (Interestingly, MacFarlane (2014: Ch. 11)\nhas recently followed suit.) Nevertheless, I will assume without\nargument that the operator-reading can be made to work even in the case of deliberative oughts. For defenses\nof this position see e.g., Broome 2000, 2013; Chrisman 2012; and\nWedgwood 2006. We can capture the particular connection between an\nagent and the obligation she has towards a proposition at a particular\ntime, by indexing the operator: \\(O_{S, t}\\). I will drop the indices\nin what follows. \nA last comment: MacFarlane is not explicit as to whether bridge\nprinciples are to be understood as synchronic\nnorms—norms that instruct us which patterns of doxastic\nattitudes are, in a specified sense, obligatory, permissible or\nreasonable at a given point in time; or whether they are to provide\ndiachronic norms—norms that instruct us how an\nagent’s doxastic state should or may evolve over time. To\nillustrate the distinction, let us consider Co+ (aka\n IMP)\n once again. Understood synchronically, the principle should be\nspelled out as follows. \nIf \\(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\dots, A_{n} \\models C\\), then if, at time \\(t\\),\n\\(S\\) believes \\(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\dots, A_{n}\\), then \\(S\\)\nought to believe \\(C\\) at time \\(t\\). \nIn other words, the principle demands that one’s beliefs be, at\nall times, closed under logical consequence. Alternatively, on might\ninterpret Co+ as a diachronic norm as follows: \nIf \\(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\dots, A_{n} \\models C\\), then if, at time \\(t\\),\n\\(S\\) believes \\(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\dots, A_{n}\\), then \\(S\\)\nought to believe \\(C\\) at time \\(t'\\) (where \\(t\\) precedes\n\\(t'\\) suitably closely). \nDifferent principles lend themselves more or less well to these two\nreadings. \\(C\\)- and \\(B\\)-type principles can be interpreted as\neither synchronic or diachronic principles on account of the fact that\nthey make explicit claims as to what an agent ought, may or has reason\nto believe or disbelieve given her other beliefs. The \\(W\\)s, by\ncontrast, are most plausibly read as synchronic principles. Such\nprinciples do not, in and of themselves, instruct the subject which\ninferences to make. Rather, they tend to proscribe certain patterns of\nbelief (and, perhaps, disbelief) or distributions of degrees of belief. \nWith the logical terrain of bridge principles charted, the question\nnow arises as to which principles (if any) are philosophically viable.\nThis is discussed in the following supplementary document: In that supplement we discuss a variety of desiderata that\nhave been put forward and consider candidate principles\nwith respect to those desiderata. \nGiven that the Preface Paradox constitutes a major stumbling block for\nmany otherwise plausible principles, we do well to explore the ways in\nwhich the Preface Paradox might be dealt with.  One way, of course, of\ndealing with the Preface Paradox is to deny it its force.  That is,\none might try to outright solve, or in some way dissolve, the\nparadox. Since it seems fair to say that no such approach has won the\nday (see entry\n epistemic paradoxes),\n I will assume that the Preface Paradox intuitions are to be take\n seriously.[20] \nAlternatively, one might acknowledge the force of the Preface\nintuitions while at the same time trying to hold on to a strict,\nought-based principle. But how? According to all such principles, I,\nthe author of a non-trivial non-fiction book (let us assume), ought to believe (or at\nleast not disbelieve) the conjunction of the propositions in my book,\ngiven that I firmly endorse each conjunct individually.\nMacFarlane’s response is that we must simply reconcile ourselves\nto the irreconcilable: the existence of an ineliminable normative conflict. Our strict\nlogical obligations clash with other epistemic obligations, namely,\nthe obligation to believe that some of my beliefs must be mistaken.\nOur agent becomes a tragic heroine. Through no fault of her own, she\nfinds herself in a situation in which, no matter what she does, she\nwill fall short of what, epistemically speaking, she ought to do. \nIt might be retorted that, as a matter of sound methodology, admitting\nan irresolvable normative clash should only be our last resort. A\nbetter approach (all other things being equal) would consist in\nfinding a way of reconciling the conflicting epistemic norms. \nAmong the qualitative principles we have been considering, the only\nway out is via non-strict principles like (Wr+b*), which we considered\nat the end of the previous section. On this principle, I, the author,\nmerely have reason (as opposed to having sufficient reason) for\nbelieving the conjunction of the claims that make up the body of my\nbook, given that I believe each of the claims individually. The\ncrucial difference resides in the fact that this leaves open the\npossibility that my reason for being logically coherent can be\noverridden. In particular, it can be outweighed by reasons stemming\nfrom other epistemic norms. In the case at hand, it might be thought\nthat our logical obligations are superseded by a norm of epistemic\nmodesty. This, of course, is not uncontroversial. Some maintain that\nwhat the Preface Paradox shows is not merely that the normative grip\nof logic does not take the form of a strict ought, but rather\nthat we in fact have no reason at all to believe in\nmulti-premise closure of belief under logical consequence: my reasons\nfor believing in the conjunction of my claims are not being trumped by\nweightier reasons for disbelieving it; I have no logic-based reason\nwhatsoever to believe the conjunction in the first place. \nSo far, then, we have considered the following reactions to the\nPreface Paradox: reject the Preface Paradox altogether; follow\nMacFarlane and cling to the strict ought-based principle at the cost\nof accepting an irresolvable normative clash; or opt for the weaker\nreason operator and give up the intuition motivating the\n Strictness Test.\n But none of these proposals incorporates what is perhaps the most\nnatural response to the Preface Paradox outside of the debate\nsurrounding the normativity of logic. A standard response to the\nPreface Paradox consists in appealing to graded credal states in lieu\nof “full” (“qualitative”, “binary”\nor “all-or-nothing”) beliefs. Such “credences”\nor “degrees of belief” (I will use the two labels\ninterchangeably) are typically modeled by means of a (possibly\npartial) credence function (which we will denote by\n“\\(cr\\)”) that maps the set of propositions into the unit\ninterval. Probabilists maintain that an ideally rational\nagent’s credence function ought to be (or at least ought to be\nextendable to) a probability function (i.e., it ought to satisfy the\nstandard axioms of probability theory). In other words, an ideally\nrational agent should have probabilistically coherent credences. \nProbabilists have no trouble accounting for the Preface phenomena: the\nsubjective probability of a (large) conjunction may well be\nlow—even zero, as in the case of the Lottery Paradox (see entry\n epistemic paradoxes)—even\nif the probability assigned to each of the individual conjuncts is\nvery high (reflecting the high degree of confidence the author rightly\nhas in each of her claims). \nA tempting strategy for formulating a bridge principle capable of\ncoping with the Preface Paradox is to incorporate these insights. This\nmight be done by going beyond MacFarlane’s classification and\ndevising instead a quantitative bridge principle: one in\nwhich logical principles directly constrain the agent’s degrees\nof belief (as opposed to constraining her full beliefs). \nHartry Field (2009a,b, 2015} proposes a bridge principles of just this\nform. Here is a formulation of such a principle: \nNote first that\n DB\n is a wide scope principle: it requires that our degrees of belief\nrespect the specified inequality, which can be achieved in one of two\nways: by suitably raising one’s degree of belief in the\nconclusion or else by readjusting one’s degrees of belief in the\npremises. \n\n DB\n is based on a well-known result in probability logic, which is\nusually stated in terms of “uncertainties” (see Adams 1998\nfor more details; for a helpful overview, see Hájek 2001).\nDefine the uncertainty of a proposition \\(A\\), \\(u(A)\\) as\n\\(u(A) = 1-cr(A)\\). Put in this way,\n DB\n says that the uncertainty of the conclusion must not exceed the sum of the uncertainties of the premises.\n DB\n can be seen to share a number of important features with standard\nprobability theory. Plug in \\(0\\) for \\(n\\) and you get that one\nshould assign \\(1\\) to any logical truth. Plug in \\(1\\) and you get\nthat one’s degree of belief in the premise of a valid\nsingle-premise argument should not exceed your degree of belief in the\nconclusion. The idea underlying\n DB\n is that uncertainties can add up and therefore need to be accounted\nfor when we are trying to determine how the logical relations between\nour belief contents should affect our degrees of belief in those\ncontents. Even if my uncertainty about each of a large number of\npremises is next to negligible when taken individually, the\nuncertainty may accumulate so as to make the conclusion highly\n(perhaps even maximally) uncertain. It is for this reason that\n DB\n gets us around the Preface Paradox; in the Preface case the number of\npremises is sufficiently high for the conclusion to admit of a very\nlow credence. \nLogical norms are naturally regarded as a species of rational\nrequirements. If I believe a set of propositions and at the same time\ndisbelieve an obvious logical consequence thereof my set of beliefs\npresumably exhibits a rational defect. Rational requirements are\ncharacterized by their demand for coherence: they demand either a\nparticular kind of coherence among our attitudes or else coherence\nbetween our attitudes and the evidence. Niko Kolodny has dubbed the\nformer “requirements of formal coherence as such” (Kolodny\n2007: 229). They are formal in the sense that they concern\nlogical relationships between attitude contents or the arithmetical\nrelationships between the degrees of confidence we invest in those\ncontents. The qualification “as such” indicates that an\ninternal coherence among the attitudes is demanded to the exclusion of\nother epistemologically relevant factors (evidential considerations,\nfor example). Requirements of this type, it has been argued (Broome\n2000; Dancy 1977), take the form of wide scope principles. Hence, they\ndo not generally prescribe a particular attitude, but are satisfiable\nin a number of ways. Or, to put it another way, they prohibit\nparticular constellations of attitudes. For instance, Wo−\nproscribes states like the one just imagined, in which the agent\nbelieves all of the premises of a valid argument while disbelieving its conclusion. It may\nbe satisfied, as we have seen, by either coming to believe the\nconclusion or by abandoning some of the premises. \nThe status of logical norms as a species of rational requirement\nraises weighty questions. For one, Kolodny (2005) has challenged the\nseemingly natural assumption that rationality is normative at all.\nThat is, he has questioned whether we in fact have reason to\ndo what rational requirements require of us. It might be that\nrationality makes certain demands on us, but that it is an open\nquestion as to whether we should want to be rational. Here is not the\nplace to develop these ideas, let alone to try to resolve the\n“normative question” for rationality (see Way 2010 for an\noverview). In the absence of a convincing response to Kolodny’s\nchallenge, some might take umbrage at our talk of logical\nnorms. Strictly speaking, we should speak of them as\nnecessary conditions for rationality, leaving open whether we have\nreason to be rational. \nWhile it would take us too far afield to address the question of the\nnormativity of rationality, there is a related strand of Kolodny’s\nargument that is more directly relevant to our discussion. The claim\nin question, put forth in Kolodny 2007 & 2008, is that there\nsimply is no reason for postulating the existence of formal coherence\nrequirements as such at all. This may seem surprising. After all, to\ntake Kolodny’s simplest example, we certainly do have the\nintuition that an agent who, at a given time, believes both \\(p\\) and\n\\(\\neg p\\) is violating a requirement—a requirement, presumably,\nof something like the following form: \nIf Kolodny is right that there are no pure formal coherence\nrequirements like\n (NC),\n how are we to explain our intuitions? Kolodny’s strategy is to\ndevise an error theory, thereby seeking to show how coherence (or near enough\ncoherence) in the relevant sense emerges as a by-product of our\ncompliance with other norms, norms that are not themselves pure formal\ncoherence requirements, thus obviating the need for postulating pure\nformal coherence requirements. \nConsider how this plays out in the case of\n (NC).\n Kolodny proposes an evidentialist response. Any violation of\n (NC)\n is indeed a violation of a norm, but the relevant norm being violated\nis a (narrow scope) evidential norm: the norm, roughly, that one has\nreason to believe a proposition only in so far as “the evidence\nindicates, or makes likely, that” the proposition is true. A\nnorm, in other words, much like\n (EN)\n (in the supplement on Bridge Principles). The thought is that any\n instance of my violating\n (NC)\n is eo ipso an instance in which my beliefs are out of whack\nwith the evidence. For when I hold contradictory beliefs, at least one\nof the beliefs must be unsupported by the evidence. As Kolodny puts\nit, \nThe attitudes that reason requires, in any given situation, are\nformally coherent. Thus, if one has formally incoherent attitudes, it\nfollows that one must be violating some requirement of reason. The\nproblem is not, as the idea of requirements of formal coherence as\nsuch suggests, that incoherent attitudes are at odds with each other.\nIt is instead that when attitudes are incoherent, it follows that one\nof these attitudes is at odds with the reason for it—as it would\nbe even if it were not part of an incoherent set. (Kolodny 2007: 231) \nAnother way of making Kolodny’s point is to note the following.\nSuppose I find myself believing both \\(p\\) and \\(\\neg p\\), but that\nthe evidence supports \\(p\\) (over its negation). If\n (NC)\n were the operative norm, I could satisfy it “against\nreason”, i.e., by coming to believe \\(\\neg p\\). But adherence to\n (NC)\n contra the evidence seems like an unjustified\n“fetish” for “psychic tidiness”. (Kolodny\nproposes similar maneuvers for other types of putative formal\ncoherence norms, and for norms of logical coherence in\nparticular.) \nWhat Kolodny assumes here is that there are, in Broome’s words,\n“no optional pairs of beliefs” (Broome 2013: 85). That is,\nit is never the case that belief in \\(A\\) and belief in \\(\\neg A\\) is\nequally permissible in light of the evidence. As Broome points out,\nKolodny’s assumption is founded on a commitment to\nevidentialism, which may cause some to get off the bus. Notice,\nthough, that even if we accept Kolodny’s argument along with its\nevidentialist presuppositions, there may still be room for logical\nnorms. Such norms would not constrain beliefs directly, since only\nevidence constrains our beliefs on Kolodny’s view. Yet, the\nevidence itself would be structured by logic. For instance, if \\(A\\)\nentails \\(B\\), then since \\(A\\) cannot be true without \\(B\\) being\ntrue, any evidence that counts in favor of \\(A\\) should also count in\nfavor of \\(B\\). Logic would then still exert normative force. However,\nits normative force would get only an indirect grip on the\nagent’s doxastic attitudes by constraining the evidence. It is not clear how robust the distinction is, especially against the background of conceptions that take evidence to be constituted largely (or entirely) by one's beliefs. Moreover, Alex Worsnip 2015 has argued that in cases of misleading higher-order evidence, failures of coherence cannot ultimately be explained in terms of failures to respond adequately to the evidence. \nAt the outset we identified two logical properties as the two central\nprotagonists in any story about the normative status of logic:\nconsistency and logical consequence. So far our focus has been almost\nexclusively on consequence. Let us now briefly turn to norms of\nconsistency. \nThe most natural and straightforward argument for consistency is that\nthe corresponding norm—something along the lines of\n CON—is\n entailed by the truth norm for belief: \nThe truth norm entails the consistency norm (given certain\nassumptions): \nFor if the set of propositions I believe at a particular point in time\nis inconsistent, they cannot all be true, which is to say that I am\nviolating the truth norm with respect to at least one of my\nbeliefs. \nSome objections to the consistency norm are closely related to the\nconsiderations of\n Excessive Demands.\n And even in cases where it would be within our powers to discover an\ninconsistency given our resources of computational power, time and so\non, it may still be reasonable to prioritize other cognitive aims\nrather than expending significant resources to resolve a minor\ninconsistency (Harman 1986). However, many authors who invoke\n (CN)\n do so in a highly idealized context. They think of the norm not as\nreason-giving or as a basis for attributing blame, but merely as an\nevaluative norm: an agent with an inconsistent belief set is less than\nperfectly\n rational.[22] \nAnother reason for rejecting\n CON\n is dialetheism (see entry on\n dialetheism).\n Clearly, if there are true contradictions, there are special cases in which one ought to have inconsistent beliefs. \nBut there is a further worry about consistency borne out of less\ncontroversial assumptions. It stems from the aforementioned fact that\nwe do not only evaluate our beliefs according to their truth status\nbut also in terms of their reasonableness in light of the evidence.\nAccordingly, there would seem to be an epistemic norm, like\n (EN)\n in the supplement on Bridge Principles,\n  that one ought to (or may) believe a proposition only if that\nproposition is likely to be true given the evidence. But if that is\nso, the following well-known scenario may arise: it may be that, for a\nset of propositions, I ought to (may) believe each of them in light of\nthe evidence, yet—because evidential support is not\nfactive—the resulting belief set turns out to be inconsistent.\nTherefore, if rationality demands that I align my beliefs with the\nevidence, rationality is no guarantee for logical consistency. Of\ncourse, it is precisely this clash between our (local) evidential norm\nand the (global) coherence norm of logical consistency that is\ndramatized in the Preface and in the Lottery paradoxes. \nIn light of such considerations, no small number of\nauthors have come to reject the consistency norm (see inter\nalia Kyburg 1970 and Christensen 2004). A particularly\ninteresting positive alternative proposal was recently made by Branden\nFitelson and Kenny Easwaran (Fitelson and Easwaran 2015, Easwaran 2015). They advance\na range of sub-consistency coherence norms for full belief inspired by\nJoyce-style accuracy-dominance arguments for probabilism as a norm for\ncredences (see Joyce 1998, 2009 and also the entry on\n epistemic utility arguments for probabilism).\n One important such norm is based on the following conception of\ncoherence. Roughly, a belief set is coherent just in case there is no\nalternative belief set that outperforms it in terms of its lower\nmeasure of inaccuracy across all possible worlds, i.e., just in case\nit is not weakly dominated with respect to accuracy. \nEven if there is a plausible sense in which logic can be said to be\nnormative for thought or reasoning, there remains a worry about\ncompetition. Logic-based norms usually target full beliefs. If that\nis correct, a significant range of rationally assessable doxastic\nphenomena fall outside of the purview of logic—most\nsignificantly for present purposes, degrees of\n belief.[23]\n Degrees of belief, according to the popular probabilist picture, are\nsubject not to logical, but to probabilistic norms, in particular the\nsynchronic norm of probabilistic\n coherence.[24]\n Consequently, the normative reach of logic would seem (at best) to be limited;\nit does not exhaust the range of doxastic phenomena. \nWorse still, some philosophers maintain that degrees of belief are the\nonly doxastic attitudes that are, in some sense, “real”,\nor at least the only ones that genuinely matter. According to them,\nonly degrees of belief are deserving of a place in our most promising\naccounts of both theoretical (broadly Bayesian) and practical (broadly\ndecision-theoretic) accounts of rationality. Full belief talk is\neither to be eliminated altogether (Jeffrey 1970), or reduced to talk\nof degrees of belief (ontologically, explanatorily or otherwise).\nOthers still acknowledge that the concept of full belief plays an\nindispensable role in our folk-psychological practices, but\nnevertheless deem it to be too blunt an instrument to earn its keep in\nrespectable philosophical and scientific theorizing (Christensen\n2004). Virtually all such “credence-first” approaches have\nin common that they threaten to eliminate the normative role of logic,\nwhich is superseded or “embedded” (Williams 2015) in\nprobabilism. \nA number of replies might be envisaged. Here we mention but a few.\nFirst, one may question the assumption that logical norms really have\nno say when it comes to credences. Field’s quantitative bridge\nprinciple is a case in point. As we have seen, it does directly\nconnect logical principles (or our attitudes towards them) with\nconstraints on the allowable ways of investing confidence in the\npropositions in question. To this it might be retorted, however, that\nField’s proposal in effect presupposes some (possibly\nnon-classical) form of subjective probability theory. After all, in\norder to align one’s credences with the demands of logic, one\nmust be capable of determining the numerical values of one’s\ncredences in logically complex propositions on the basis of\none’s degrees of belief in simple propositions. This is most\nnaturally done by appealing to probability\n theory.[25]\n But if so, it looks as if probability theory is really doing all of\nthe normative work and hence that logic would seem to be little more\nthan a redundant tag-along. Second, one might try to downplay the\nimportance of degrees of belief in our cognitive economy. In its\nstrongest form such a position amounts to a form of eliminativism or\nreduction in the opposite direction: against credences and in favor of\nfull belief. Harman (1986), for instance, rejects the idea that\nordinary agents operate with anything like credences. Harman does not\ndeny that beliefs may come in varying degrees of strength. However, he\nmaintains that this feature can be explained wholly in terms of full\nbeliefs: either as belief in a proposition whose content is\nprobabilistic or else  \nas a kind of epiphenomenon resulting from the operation of rules of\nrevision [e.g., you believe \\(P\\) to a higher degree than \\(Q\\) iff it\nis harder to stop believing \\(P\\) than to stop believing \\(Q\\)].\n(Harman 1986: 22)  \nMore moderate positions accord both graded and categorical beliefs\nalong with their respective attendant norms a firm place in our\ncognitive economies, either by seeking to give a unified account of\nboth concepts (Foley 1993; Sturgeon 2008; Leitgeb 2013) or else by\nreconciling themselves to what Christensen (2004) calls a\n“bifurcation account”, i.e., the view that there is no\nunifying account to be had and hence that both types of belief and\ntheir attendant norms operate autonomously (Buchak 2014; Kaplan 1996;\nMaher 1993; Stalnaker 1984). Summarizing, then, so long, at least, as\nfull belief continues to occupy an ineliminable theoretical role to in\nour best theories, there still is a case to be made that it is to\nlogic that we should continue to look in seeking to articulate the\nnorms governing these qualitative doxastic states.","contact.mail":"f.steinberger@bbk.ac.uk","contact.domain":"bbk.ac.uk"}]
