To say that something\nis authentic is to say that it is what it professes to be, or what it\nis reputed to be, in origin or authorship. But the distinction between\nauthentic and derivative is more complicated when discussing\nauthenticity as a characteristic attributed to human beings. For in\nthis case, the question arises: What is it to be oneself, at one with\noneself, or truly representing one’s self? The multiplicity of puzzles\nthat arise in conjunction with the conception of authenticity connects\nwith metaphysical, epistemological, and moral issues (for recent discussion, see Newman and Smith 2016; Heldke and Thomsen 2014). On the one hand,\nbeing oneself is inescapable, since whenever one makes a choice or\nacts, it is oneself who is doing these things. But on the other hand,\nwe are sometimes inclined to say that some of the thoughts, decisions\nand actions that we undertake are not really one’s own and\nare therefore not genuinely expressive of who one is. Here, the issue\nis no longer of metaphysical nature, but rather about\nmoral-psychology, identity and responsibility.\n\nWhen used in this latter sense, the characterization describes a\nperson who acts in accordance with desires, motives, ideals or beliefs\nthat are not only hers (as opposed to someone else’s), but that also\nexpress who she really is. Bernard Williams captures this when he\nspecifies authenticity as “the idea that some things are in some\nsense really you, or express what you are, and others aren’t”\n(quoted in Guignon 2004: viii).\n\nBesides being a topic in philosophical debates, authenticity is\nalso a pervasive ideal that impacts social and political\nthinking. In fact, one distinctive feature of recent Western\nintellectual developments has been a shift to what is called the\n“age of authenticity” (Taylor 2007; Ferrarra 1998).\nTherefore, understanding the concept also involves investigating its\nhistorical and philosophical sources and on the way it impacts the\nsocio-political outlook of contemporary societies.\n\nA number of significant cultural changes in the seventeenth and\neighteenth centuries led to the emergence of a new ideal in the\nWestern world (Trilling 1972). During this period, human beings came to be\nthought of more as individuals than as placeholders in systems of\nsocial relations. This emphasis on the importance of the individual is\nseen in the prevalence of autobiographies and self-portraits, where\nthe individual becomes the centre of attention not because of\nextraordinary feats or access to special knowledge, but because he or\nshe is an individual. In the same period, society comes to be seen not as an organic\nwhole of interacting components, but as an aggregate of individual\nhuman beings, a social system with a life of its own, which presents\nitself to the individual as not itself quite human but rather as\nartificial, the result of a “social contract”. Being human\nis understood as being best achieved through being unique and\ndistinctive, even when these collide with certain social norms. At the\nsame time, there is an increasing awareness of what Charles Taylor\n(1989) calls “inwardness” or “internal\nspace”. The result is a distinction between one’s private and\nunique individuality, and one’s public self (Taylor 1991; Trilling\n1972). With these social changes there is a sharp shift in the conceptions\nof approbation and disapproval that are commonly used in judging\nothers and oneself. For instance, concepts like sincerity and honor\nbecome obsolescent (Berger 1970). In earlier times, a sincere person\nwas seen as someone who honestly attempts to neither violate the\nexpectations that follow from the position he holds in society, nor to\nstrive to appear otherwise than he ought to. However, by the time of\nHegel, the ideal of sincerity had lost its normative appeal. Hegel\npolemically refers to sincerity as “the heroism of dumb\nservice” (Hegel 2002 [1807]: 515) and launches an attack on the\nbourgeois “honest man,” who passively internalizes a\nparticular conventional social ethos. In the condition of sincerity,\nthe individual is uncritically obedient to the power of\nsociety—a conformity that for Hegel leads to subjugation and a\ndeterioration of the individual (Hegel 2002 [1807]; Golomb 1995: 9;\nTrilling 1972).  For Hegel, in the progress of “spirit”,\nthe individual consciousness will eventually move from this condition\nof sincerity to a condition of baseness, in which the individual\nbecomes antagonistic to external societal powers and achieves a\nmeasure of autonomy. Hegel shows this clearly in a comment on\nDiderot’s Rameau’s Nephew, a story in which the narrator\n(supposedly Diderot himself) is portrayed as the reasonable, sincere\nman who respects the prevailing order and who has achieved bourgeois\nrespectability. In contrast, the nephew is full of contempt for the\nsociety in which he figures as a worthless person. However, he is in\nopposition to himself, because he still aspires to a better standing\nin a society, which he believes has nothing but emptiness to offer\n(Despland 1975: 360; Golomb 1995: 13–15). For Hegel, the\nnarrator is an example of the sincere, honest soul, while the nephew\nfigures as the “disintegrated,” alienated\nconsciousness. The nephew is clearly alienated, but for Hegel this\nalienation is a step in the progression towards autonomous existence\n(Williams 2002: 190). In the midst of this conceptual change, the term\n‘authenticity’ becomes applicable in demarcating a\nsomewhat new set of virtues. The older concept of sincerity, referring\nto being truthful in order to be honest in one’s dealings with others,\ncomes to be replaced by a relatively new concept of authenticity,\nunderstood as being true to oneself for one’s own benefit.  Earlier,\nthe moral advice to be authentic recommended that one should be true\nto oneself in order thereby to be true to others.  Thus,\nbeing true to oneself is seen as a means to the end of\nsuccessful social relations. In contrast, in our contemporary\nthinking, authenticity as a virtue term is seen as referring to a way\nof acting that is choiceworthy in itself (Ferrara 1993; Varga\n2011a; Varga 2011b). The growing appeal of the idea of authenticity has led to the\nemergence of a highly influential modern “ethic of\nauthenticity” (Ferrara 1993; Ferrara 2017). This ethic acknowledges the value\nof the dominant “ethic of autonomy” that shapes modern\nmoral thought (Schneewind 1998; Dworkin 1988). The idea of autonomy\nemphasizes the individual’s self-governing abilities, the independence\nof one’s deliberation from manipulation and the capacity to decide for\noneself. It is connected to the view that moral principles and the\nlegitimacy of political authority should be grounded in the\nself-governing individual who is free from diverse cultural and social\npressures. According to the ethic of autonomy, each individual should\nfollow those norms he or she can will on the basis of rational\nreflective endorsement. To some extent, authenticity and autonomy\nagree in supposing that one should strive to lead one’s life according\nto one’s own reasons and motives, relying on one’s capacity to\nfollow self-imposed guidelines. In both cases, it is crucial\nthat one has the ability to put one’s own behavior under reflexive\nscrutiny and make it dependent on self-determined goals (Honneth\n1994). One crucial difference is that the ethic of authenticity introduces\nthe idea that there are motives, desires and commitments that\nsometimes should outweigh the restrictions of rational\nreflection. This is because those motives are so fundamental to the\ncohesion of one’s own identity that overriding them would mean\ndisintegrating the very self which is necessary to be a moral\nagent. The point is that there are types of moral philosophical\nreasoning that can be repressive if they arise from “an\nautonomous moral conscience not complemented by sensitivity to the\nequilibrium of identity and by authenticity” (Ferrara 1993:\n102). Besides leading an autonomous life, guided by one’s own,\nnon-constrained reasons and motives, authenticity requires that these\nmotives and reasons should be expressive of one’s\nself-identity. Authenticity guides the moral agent to follow only\nthose “moral sources outside the subject [that speak in\na language] which resonate[s] within him or her”, in\nother words, moral sources that accord with “an order which is\ninseparably indexed to a personal vision” (Taylor 1989:\n510). Hence, authenticity entails an aspect that lies beyond the scope\nof autonomy, namely, a “language of personal resonance”\n(Taylor 1991: 90). This points to the gap between (Kantian) autonomy\nand authenticity: one can lead an autonomous life, even if this way of\nliving fails to express a person’s self-understanding.  In recent years, more attention has been devoted to highlighting how autonomy and authenticity can come apart (e.g. Oshana 2007; Roessler 2012; MacKay forthcoming). Some argue that authenticity demands more than is necessary for autonomy: a person does not have to reflectively endorse key aspects of her identity in order to qualify as autonomous (Oshana 2007). If she acknowledges that aspects of her identity contradict her self-conception, she might still be autonomous, even if this acknowledgement injects ambivalence into her life.  In all, the ideal of authenticity does not object to the importance\nof the self-given law, but disagrees that full freedom consists in\nmaking and following such a law (Menke 2005: 308). It is not just\nabout being involved in the authorship of such a law, but about how\nthis law fits with the wholeness of a person’s life, and how or\nwhether it expresses who the person is. In this sense, the idea of\nautonomy already represents a counterposition to an ethic that is\nsolely concerned with strict adherence to social norms. Another decisive factor in the development of the ideal of\nauthenticity was that it emerged together with a distinctively modern\nconception of the self. This is visible in the work of Rousseau, who\nargues that the orientation toward life that should guide the conduct\none chooses should come from a source within. This led to questions\nabout inwardness, self-reflection and introspection, many of them\naddressed in his Confessions (1770). When the space of\ninteriority becomes a guiding authority, the individual must detect\nand distinguish central impulses, feelings and wishes from ones that\nare less central or conflict with one’s central motives. In other\nwords, interiority must be divided into what is at the core and what\nis peripheral. In this picture, the measure of one’s actions is\nwhether they spring from and express essential aspects of one’s\nidentity or whether they come from a peripheral place. Such a conception of the self exhibits decisive parallels to the\ntradition of “religious individualism” that centers\nreligious life on the individual and stresses the importance of\ninwardness and the introspective examination of one’s inner motives,\nintentions and conscience. Investigating the characteristics of the\nmodern subject of inwardness, Foucault (1980: 58–60) suggests\nthat “it seems to us that truth, lodged in our most secret\nnature, ‘demands’ only to surface.” For Foucault,\nconfession—the look inward to monitor one’s interior life and to\ntell certain “truths” about oneself—has become a\npart of a cultural life, reaching from religious contexts to\npsychological therapy. The radicalization of the distinction between\ntrue and false interiority has led to new possibilities; inner states,\nmotivations and feelings are now increasingly thought of as\nobjectifiable and malleable in different contexts.  Rousseau also adds that acting on motives that spring from the\nperiphery of the self, while ignoring or denying essential aspects of\none’s self, simply amounts to self-betrayal and annihilation of the\nself. Rousseau’s The New Heloise (1997 [1761]) emphasizes\nthis aspect by showing how the novel accentuates the significant costs\nand the potential self-alienation involved in suppressing one’s\ndeepest motivations. But, in addition, in the Discourse on the\nOrigin of Inequality, Rousseau argues that, with the emergence of\na competitive public sphere, the ability to turn inward is\nincreasingly compromised, because competitive relations require\nintense role-playing, which Rousseau calls an “excessive\nlabor” (Rousseau 1992 [1754]: 22). The ongoing instrumental\nrole-playing not only causes alienation, but ultimately inequality and\ninjustice, since it destroys the immanent moral understanding with\nwhich, according to Rousseau, humans are hard-wired. Social life requires identification with social roles, but because role identity is determined by other people’s normative expectations, role-playing leads to a tension that might be understood as a matter of politics more than anything else (Schmid 2017).  \n The idea of autonomy—the view that each individual must\ndecide how to act based on his or her own rational deliberations about\nthe best course of action—has in many ways paved the way for the\nidea of authenticity. However, authenticity goes beyond autonomy by\nholding that an individual’s feelings and deepest desires can outweigh\nboth the outcome of rational deliberation in making decisions, and our\nwillingness to immerse ourselves into the reigning norms and values of\nsociety. Whereas sincerity generally seems to accept a given social\norder, authenticity becomes an implicitly critical concept, often\ncalling into question the reigning social order and public opinion. In\nRousseau’s optic, one of our most important projects is to avert from\nthe social sphere and to unearth what is truly us underneath\nthe ‘masks’ that society forces on us. But when\nauthenticity comes to be regarded as something like sincerity for its\nown sake (Ferrara 1993: 86), it becomes increasingly hard to see what\nthe moral good is that it is supposed to bring into being. A frequently mentioned worry with the ideal of authenticity is that\nthe focus on one’s own inner feelings and attitudes may breed a\nself-centered preoccupation with oneself that is anti-social and\ndestructive of altruism and compassion toward others.  Christopher\nLasch (1979)\npoints out similarities between the clinical disorder referred to as\nNarcissistic Personality Disorder and authenticity. According to\nLasch, narcissism and authenticity are both characterized by deficient\nempathic skills, self-indulgence and self-absorbed\nbehavior. Similarly, Allan Bloom (1987: 61) maintains that the culture\nof authenticity has made the minds of the youth “narrower and\nflatter,” leading to self-centeredness and the collapse of the\npublic self. While Lasch and Bloom worry about the threat that the\nself-centeredness and narcissism of the “culture of\nauthenticity” poses to morality and political coherence, Daniel\nBell voices worries about its economic viability.  What Bell fears is\nthat the “megalomania of self-infinitization” that comes\nwith the culture of authenticity will erode the foundations of market\nmechanisms that are “based on a moral system of reward rooted in\nthe Protestant sanctification of work” (Bell 1976: 84).\nMore recently, critics have argued that when properly analyzed, authenticity demands positing the existence of a “true self.” It requires positing an essentialist structure leading to metaphysical problems that current accounts of authenticity fail to solve (Bialystok 2014). Correspondingly, Feldman (2014) argues in favor of abandoning the ideal of authenticity because it builds on confused assumptions about the self, the value of one’s “gut feelings” in revealing one’s values, and the supposedly corrupting influence of the “external” social realm (for a critique of this position, see Bauer 2017; Ferrara 2009)\n However, one might argue that this only becomes a problem if one\nthinks of authenticity as entirely a personal virtue. In other words,\nthere is only a clash between morality and social life and being\nauthentic if the “true” self is regarded as fundamentally\nprone to anti-social behaviour. But many thinkers at this time\nunderstood human nature as fundamentally disposed toward beneficence,\nso that evil was seen as arising from socialization and upbringing\nrather than from deep drives within the human being. For instance,\nRousseau holds that certain immoral characteristics are immanent in\nman but were produced by the dynamics of modern society, which is\ncharacterized by a competitive way of relating to others and striving\nfor acknowledgement in the public sphere. Rousseau thus externalizes\nthe origins of societal evil and alienation from the original nature\nof man. The undistorted self-relation of natural man inspires sympathy\nand considerate relations with others, sensitive to “seeing any\nsentient being, especially our fellow-man, perish or suffer,\nprincipally those like ourselves” (Rousseau 1992 [1754]: 14). In\nsomewhat the same way, economic theorists of the time supposed that\nunregulated markets are self-correcting, as human beings are naturally\ninclined to engage in mutually advantageous commercial activities\n(Taylor 2007: 221–269). On this view, authenticity does not\namount to egoism or self-absorption. On the contrary, the prevailing\nview seems to have been that, by turning inward and accessing the\n“true” self, one is simultaneously led towards a deeper\nengagement with the social world. This is why Taylor (1989:\n419–455) describes the trajectory of the project of authenticity\nis “inward and upward”. It might however be objected that supposing that the\n“inner” is a morally worthy guide is deeply misguided and\nbuilds upon an overly optimistic idea of human nature. It may be\nargued that once the idea of rational deliberation is set aside, the\npowerful impact of the non-rational becomes apparent. Thinkers such as\nNietzsche and Freud have put in question the conception of human\nnature, and especially of our “inner” nature, as\nfundamentally good.  Following their “hermeneutics of\nsuspicion” (Ricoeur 1970), human nature comes to be seen as\nincluding forces of violence, disorder and unreason as well as\ntendencies toward beneficence and altruism. In that case, any idea of\nan ethic based primarily on the ideal of authenticity is simply\nuntenable. Others have expressed serious concerns not about the optimistic\nview of human nature, but about the conception of the self that\nunderlies the idea of authenticity. Some argued that the dichotomies\nthat the concept authenticity was built on, like conformity\nvs. independence, individual vs. society, or inner-directedness\nvs. other-directedness, were entirely misguided. The underlying\nassumption that considers the individual separate from the environment\nis an absurd assumption that erodes that bond between the individual\nand community, which ultimately is the source of the authentic self\n(Slater 1970: 15; Sisk 1973). In agreement with Slater (1970) and Yankelovich\n(1981), Bellah et al. (1985) and Fairlie (1978) contend\nthat such a pursuit of authenticity is self-defeating, for with the\nloss of the bond with community, the sense of self is also\ndiminished. Additionally, in The Jargon of Authenticity, Adorno\ncontended that the “liturgy of inwardness” is founded on\nthe flawed idea of a self-transparent individual who is capable of\nchoosing herself (Adorno 1973: 70).  The doubtful picture of the\nself-centered individual covers up the constitutive alterity and\nmimetic nature of the self. In the concluding part of The Order of\nThings, Foucault maintained that present society was witnessing a\ncrisis, not only of authenticity but also of the whole idea of the\nsubject in its temporary historically contingent constitution,\nforeseeing that “man would be erased, like a face drawn in sand\nat the edge of the sea” (Foucault 1994: 387). Foucault clearly\nopposed the idea of a hidden authentic self, which he critically\nreferred to as the “Californian cult of the self” (1983:\n266). The recognition that the subject is not given to itself in\nadvance leads him to the practical consequence that it must create\nitself as a work of art (Foucault 1983: 392). Rather than searching for a hidden true\nself, one should attempt to shape one’s life as a work of art,\nproceeding without recourse to any fixed rules or permanent truths in\na process of unending becoming (Foucault 1988: 49). In a similar vein,\nRichard Rorty has argued that the idea of coming to “know a\ntruth which was out there (or in here) all the time” (Rorty\n1989: 27) is simply a myth. Postmodern thought raises questions about\nthe existence of an underlying subject with essential properties\naccessible through introspection. The whole idea of the authentic as\nthat which is “original”, “essential”,\n“proper”, and so forth now seems doubtful. If we are\nself-constituting beings who make ourselves up from one moment to the\nnext, it appears that the term “authenticity” can refer\nonly to whatever feels right at some particular moment. Yet others have based their criticism of authenticity especially on\nthe emergence of a pervasive “culture of\nauthenticity”. Cultural critics have argued that the ostensible\n“decline” of modern society might not primarily be a\nresult of economical or structural transformations, but as the outcome\nof an increasingly ubiquitous ideal of authenticity. Before we turn to\nthese critiques, it is helpful to understand how the ideal of\nauthenticity became so widespread. First, we should mention that\nRousseau’s work, made a significant contribution to the popularization\nof authenticity.  Indeed, some argue that authenticity can be seen as a “keystone” in Rousseau’s work, giving unity to his reflections on sociality, political order, and education (Ferrara 2017: 2). Particularly The New Heloise (1997 [1761])\nwas enormously influential, with at least 70 editions in print before\n1800 (Darnton 1984: 242). This dispersion of the ideal of authenticity\ninto popular culture was further strengthened by several factors. For\ninstance, a wide array of intellectuals of the nineteenth and the\nearly twentieth century had embraced the idea of authenticity, and\neven radicalized it by resisting established codes and publicly\ndefending alternative, “artistic” or\n“bohemian” modes of life.  The reception of the work of Sartre and Heidegger has surely\ncontributed to the popularization of the idea of authenticity, and the\ndecisive impact of this idea first began to manifest itself after the\nSecond World War (Taylor 2007: 475). Rossinow contends that the\npolitics of the 1960s were centered on questions of authenticity.\nFollowing his account, the main driving force towards political and\nsocial changes of the New Left movement in the 1960s was “a\nsearch for authenticity in industrial American life” (Rossinow\n1998: 345).  Both J. Farrell (1997) and Rossinow argue that the New\nLeft emerged partly as a reaction to traditional American liberalism\nand Christian existentialism, replacing the negative concept of\n“sin” with “alienation” and the positive goal\nof “salvation” with that of\n“authenticity”. Confronted with what they understood as\nalienation that “isn’t restricted to the poor” (Rossinow\n1998: 194), New Left activism reached beyond civil rights to moral\nrights and attempted to bring about a recovery of a sense of personal\nwholeness and authenticity by curing the institutions of American\nsociety. The emerging youth culture was characterized by a severe\ndissatisfaction with the “morass of conformity” of the\nparental generation (Gray 1965: 57). The critique of the growing\nconformity of life got more persistent during the 1950s, and a number\nof social scientists in widely read books criticized what they saw as\nwidespread conformity and inauthenticity. Among these, The Lonely\nCrowd (1950) by Riesman and The Organization Man (1956)\nby Whyte received the most attention. Riesman points out that the\nefficacious functioning of modern organizations requires\nother-directed individuals who smoothly adjust to their\nenvironment. However, he also notes that such people compromised\nthemselves, and a society consisting mostly of other-directed\nindividuals faces substantial deficiencies in leadership and human\npotential. On the background of this development, it seems that at a time when\nrelativism appears difficult to surmount, authenticity has become a\nlast measure of value and a common currency in contemporary cultural\nlife (Jay 2004). So, under the impact of existentialism on Western\nculture, the ubiquitous desire for authenticity has emerged in modern\nsociety as “one of the most politically explosive of human\nimpulses,” as Marshall Berman argues (1970: xix).  Kierkegaard’s work on authenticity and his suggestion that\neach of us is to “become what one is” (1992 [1846]: 130),\nis best seen as linked to his critical stance towards a certain social\nreality and a certain essentialist trend in philosophical and\nscientific thought. On the one hand, he (1962 [1846]) condemned\naspects of his contemporary social world, claiming that many people\nhave come to function as merely place-holders in a society that\nconstantly levels down possibilities to the lowest common\ndenominator. In more contemporary terms, we can say that Kierkegaard\nprovides a criticism of modern society as causing\n“inauthenticity”. Living in a society characterized by\nsuch “massification” lead to what he refers to as\nwidespread “despair” that comes to the fore as\nspiritlessness, denial, and defiance. On the other hand, he rejected\nthe view that a human being should be regarded as an object,\nas a substance with certain essential attributes.  Rather than\nbeing an item among others, Kierkegaard proposes to understand the\nself in relational terms: “The self is a relation that relates\nitself to itself…” (Kierkegaard 1980 [1849]:13).  This\nrelation consists in the unfolding project of taking what we find\nourselves with as beings in the world and imparting some meaning or\nconcrete identity to our own life course. Thus, the self is defined by\nconcrete expressions through which one manifests oneself in\nthe world and thereby constitutes one’s identity over time. In\nKierkegaard’s view, “becoming what one is” and evading\ndespair and hollowness is not a matter of solitary introspection, but\nrather a matter of passionate commitment to a relation to something\noutside oneself that bestows one’s life with meaning. For Kierkegaard,\nas a religious thinker, this ultimate commitment was his defining\nrelation to God. The idea is that passionate care about something\noutside ourselves gives diachronic coherence in our lives and provides\nthe basis for the narrative unity of the self (Davenport 2012). Heidegger’s conception of human existence (or, as calls it,\nDasein, ‘being-there’) echoes Kierkegaard’s\nconception of the “self”. Rather than being an object\namong others, Dasein is a “relation of being”\n(Seinsverhältnis; Heidegger 1962 [1927]: 12)—a\nrelation that obtains between what one is at any moment and what one\ncan and will be as the temporally extended unfolding of life into a\nrealm of possibilities. To conceive Dasein as relational means that in\nliving out our lives, we always already care: for each of us,\nour being is always at issue and this is made concrete in the\nspecific actions we undertake and the roles we enact. Over the course\nof our lives, our identities are always in question: we are always\nprojections into the future, incessantly taking a stand on who we\nare. The most familiar conception of “authenticity” comes to\nus mainly from Heidegger’s Being and Time of 1927. The word\nwe translate as ‘authenticity’ is actually a neologism\ninvented by Heidegger, the word Eigentlichkeit, which comes\nfrom an ordinary term, eigentlich, meaning\n‘really’ or ‘truly’, but is built on the\nstem eigen, meaning ‘own’ or\n‘proper’. So the word might be more literally translated\nas ‘ownedness’, or ‘being owned’, or even\n‘being one’s own’, implying the idea of owning up to and\nowning what one is and does (for a stimulating recent interpretation, see McManus 2019). Nevertheless, the word\n‘authenticity’ has become closely associated with\nHeidegger as a result of early translations of Being and Time\ninto English, and was adopted by Sartre and Beauvoir as well as by\nexistentialist therapists and cultural theorists who followed\nthem.[1] Heidegger’s conception of ownedness as the most fully realized\nhuman form of life emerges from his view of what it is to be a human\nbeing. This conception of human Dasein echoes Kierkegaard’s\ndescription of a “self”. On Heidegger’s account, Dasein is\nnot a type of object among others in the totality of what is on hand\nin the universe. Instead, human being is a “relation of\nbeing”, a relation\nthat obtains between what one is at any moment (the immediacy of the\nconcrete present as it has evolved) and what one can and will be as\nthe temporally extended unfolding or happening of life into\nan open realm of possibilities. To say that human being is a relation\nis to say that, in living out our lives, we always care about\nwho and what we are. Heidegger expresses this by saying that, for each\nof us, our being (what our lives will amount to overall) is\nalways at issue. This “being at stake” or\n“being in question for oneself” is made concrete in the\nspecific stands we take—that is, in the roles we\nenact—over the course of our lives. It is because our being (our\nidentity) is in question for us that we are always taking a stand on\nwho we are. Since the German word for\n‘understanding’, Verstehen, is etymologically\nderived from the idea of ‘taking a stand’, Heidegger can\ncall the projection into the future by which we shape our identity\n‘understanding’. And because any stand one takes is\ninescapably “being-in-the-world”, understanding carries\nwith it some degree of competence in coping with the world around us.\nAn understanding of being in general is therefore built into human\nagency. To the extent that all our actions contribute to realizing an\noverarching project or set of projects, our active lives can be seen\nas embodying a life-project of some sort. On Heidegger’s view, we\nexist for the sake of ourselves: enacting roles and\nexpressing character traits contribute to realizing some image of what\nit is to be human in our own cases. Existence has a directedness or\npurposiveness that imparts a degree of connection to our life\nstories. For the most part, having such a life-plan requires very\nlittle conscious formulation of goals or deliberation about means. It\nresults from our competence in being members of a historical culture\nthat we have mastered to a great extent in growing up into a shared\nworld. This tacit “pre-understanding” makes possible our\nfamiliar dwelling with things and others in the familiar, everyday\nworld. Heidegger holds that all possibilities of concrete understanding\nand action are made possible by a background of shared practices\nopened up by the social context in which we find ourselves, by what he\ncalls the ‘They’ (das Man). Far from it being the\ncase that social existence is something alien to and opposed to our\nhumanity, Heidegger holds that we are always essentially and\ninescapably social beings. As he says, They itself prescribes that way of interpreting\nthe world that lies closest. Dasein is for the sake of the They in an\neveryday manner… In terms of the They, and as the They, I am\n‘given’ proximally to ‘myself’…. (1962\n[1927]: 167, translation modified) To be a teacher, for instance, I must adopt (and\nperhaps blend) some set of the ready-made styles of classroom\npresentation and of dealing with students laid out in advance by\nexisting norms and conventions of professional conduct.  To say that we are always the They is not to say we are automata,\nhowever. Heidegger suggests that even in the bland conformism of\n“average everydayness” we are constantly making choices\nthat reflect our understanding of who we are. Nevertheless, in average\neverydayness, we are as a rule adrift, acting as one of the\n“herd” or “crowd”—a form of life\nHeidegger calls “falling” (Verfallen). Heidegger\n(1962 [1927]: 220) emphasizes that calling this way of living\n“falling” does not imply that it is “a bad or\ndeplorable ontical property of which, perhaps, more advanced stages of\nhuman culture might be able to rid themselves” (1962 [1927]:\n220). On the contrary, since there is no exit from the social\nworld—since it is the “only game in town”—it\nplays a positive role in creating the background of shared\nintelligibility that lets us be fully human in the first\nplace. Nevertheless, Heidegger is aware that there is something deeply\nproblematic about this falling mode of existence. In “doing what\none does”, he suggests, we fail to own up to who we are. We do\nnot take over our own choices as our own and, as a result, we are not\nreally the authors of our own lives. To the extent that our lives are\nunowned or disowned, existence is inauthentic (uneigentlich),\nnot our own (eigen). Our condition as They-selves is one of dispersal, distraction and\nforgetfulness. But this “downward plunge” captures only\none aspect of Dasein, Heidegger says. In order to be able to realize\nthe capacity for authenticity, one must undergo a personal\ntransformation, one that tears us away from falling. This is possible\nonly given certain fundamental insights arising in a life. The first\nmajor shift can occur when one experiences an intense bout of\nanxiety. In anxiety, the familiar world that seemed to assure one’s\nsecurity suddenly breaks down, and in this world-collapse one finds\nthat the significance of things is “completely lacking”\n(1962 [1927]: 186).  One finds oneself alone, with no worldly supports\nfor one’s existence. In anxiety, Dasein encounters itself as\nan individual, ultimately alone. In Heidegger’s words,\n“Anxiety individualizes Dasein and thus discloses it as\n‘solus ipse’” (1962 [1927]: 188). The\nsecond transformative event is the encounter with one’s\n“ownmost” possibility, the possibility of death as the\npossible loss of all possibilities. In facing our own finitude, we\nfind that we are always future-directed happenings or projects, where\nwhat is crucial to that ongoing forward movement is not its\nactualization of possibilities, but the “How” with which\none undertakes one’s life. Heidegger tries to envision a way of life\nhe calls anticipatory running-forward (Vorlaufen) as\na life that clear-sightedly and intensely carries out its projects, no\nmatter what they may be. The third transformative event is hearing the\ncall of conscience. What conscience calls out to us is the fact that\nwe are “guilty” in the German sense of that word, which\nmeans that we have a debt (Schuld) and are\nresponsible for ourselves. Conscience tells us that we are falling\nshort of what we can be, and that we are obliged to take up the task\nof living with resoluteness and full engagement. Such resoluteness is\nseen clearly in the case of vocational commitments, where one has\nheard a calling and feels pulled toward pursuing that\ncalling.[2] The three “existentialia” that structure Dasein’s\nBeing-in-the-world make up the “formal existential totality of\nDasein’s structural whole”, what Heidegger\ncalls care. To be Dasein, an entity must have some sense of\nwhat it is “coming toward” (Zu-kunft, the German\nfor “future”), what has “come before” (what is\n“passed”, Vorbei), and what one is dealing with\nin one’s current situation (“making present”). The\ndefining characteristics of Dasein’s potentiality-for-Being are\ndisplayed in the transformative events that lead to the possibility of\nbeing authentic (eigentlich, as we saw, from the stem meaning\n“proper” or “own”). When Dasein confronts and\ngrasps its authentic possibility of being, it becomes possible to see\nthe whole of Dasein, including both its being as a They-self\nand as authentic being-one’s-self.  “Dasein is authentically\nitself in [its] primordial individualization”, where the\n“constancy [Ständigkeit] of the Self\n… gets clarified” (1962 [1927]: 322).  What defines the\nwholeness and unity of Dasein is determined not by an underlying\nsubstance (e.g., the sub-ject, that which underlies), but by the\n“steadiness and steadfastness” (beständigen\nStandfestigkeit, ibid) of authenticity. The key to understanding authenticity lies, as we have seen, in the\ncharacterization of Dasein’s being as a relation between two\naspects or dimensions making up human existence. On the one hand, we\nfind ourselves thrown into a world and a situation not of our\nown making, already disposed by moods and particular commitments, with\na past behind us that constrains our choices. With respect to this\ndimension of human life, we are generally absorbed in practical\naffairs, taking care of business, striving to get things done as they\ncrop up from time to time. This “being-in-a-situation”\nnaturally inclines us to everyday falling as Heidegger describes\nit. At the same time, however, to be human is to be underway toward\nachieving ends that are understood as integral to one’s overarching\nlife-project. My actions at any moment, though typically aimed at\naccomplishing tasks laid out by the demands of circumstances, are also\ncumulatively creating me as a person of a particular sort. In this\nsense, my futural projection as “understanding” has the\nstructure of being a projection onto one’s ownmost possibility of\nbeing. So, for example, when I attend a boring parent/teacher\nconference, I do so as part of handling my current duties. But this\nact is also part of being a parent insofar as it contributes\nto determining “that for the sake of which” I understand\nmyself as existing. Given this distinction between current means/ends\nstrategic actions and long-range life-defining undertakings, it is\npossible to see that there are two senses of freedom in play in\nHeidegger’s account of human existence. There is freedom in the\nhumdrum sense of doing what I choose to do under ordinary conditions,\na freedom Heidegger presumably interprets in an agent-libertarian way.\nBut there is also freedom in an ethically more robust sense. In\naddition to choosing courses of action among options, Dasein is\ncapable of “choosing to choose a kind of being-one’s-self”\n(1962 [1927]: 314) through its ongoing constitution of that identity\nfor the sake of which it exists. Thus, I attend the parent/teacher\nconference and behave in a particular way because I care about being a\nparent and a citizen of a particular sort. I understand this stance as\nhaving repercussions for my life as a whole, and I grasp the need\nfor resoluteness in holding steady to undertakings of this\nsort if I am to shape my identity in the way I can care about. For\nHeidegger, the resolute commitment that is made concrete and defined\nin one’s day-to-day actions is what imparts steadiness\nand steadfastness to a life. It is also the condition for\nbeing responsible for one’s own existence: “Only so can\n[one] be responsible [verantwortlich]”,\nHeidegger says (1962 [1927]: 334, translation modified). Authenticity,\ndefined as standing up for and standing behind what one\ndoes—as owning and owning up to one’s deeds as\nan agent in the world—becomes possible in this sort of resolute\ncommitment to the “for the sake of which” of one’s\nexistence. It should be obvious that this conception of authenticity has very\nlittle to do with the older idea of being true to one’s own pregiven\nfeelings and desires. But there is still a clear respect in which the\nidea of “being true to oneself” has a role to play\nhere. What distinguishes this conception from the conceptions of pop\npsychology and romantic views of authenticity is the fact that the\n“true self” to which we are to be true is not some\npre-given set of substantive feelings, opinions and desires to be\nconsulted through inward-turning or introspection. On the contrary,\nthe “true self” alluded to here is an on-going narrative\nconstruction: the composition of one’s own autobiography through one’s\nconcrete ways of acting over the course of a life as a whole. Feelings\nand desires are, of course, profoundly important, as are the features\nof one’s situation and one’s concrete connections to others. Heidegger\nwants to recover a firm sense of the wholeness of the existing\nindividual. But this wholeness is found in the connectedness of what\nHeidegger calls the “happening” or “movement”\nof a life—that is, in the unfolding and constantly\n“in-progress” storyizing that continues until death. What\nis at stake in the ideal of authenticity is not being true to some\nantecedently given nature, then, but being a person of a\nparticular sort. Heidegger emphasizes that being authentic presupposes\nthat one instantiate such virtues as perseverance, integrity,\nclear-sightedness, flexibility, openness, and so forth. It should be\nobvious that such a life is not necessarily opposed to an ethical and\nsocially engaged existence. On the contrary, authenticity seems to be\nregarded as a “executive virtue” that provides the condition\nfor the possibility of being a moral agent in any meaningful sense\nwhatsoever. Others argue that Heidegger uses authenticity in both\nevaluative-normative and purely descriptive senses. In the descriptive\nuse of the term, inauthenticity is simply the default condition of\neveryday life, in which our self-relations are mediated by others. In\nthis sense, authenticity involves no judgment about which mode of\nbeing is superior for Dasein. But sometimes Heidegger’s language turns\nnormative (Carman 2003), and the seemingly neutral inauthentic form of\nrelating transforms into something negative. Inauthentic Dasein is now\n“not itself”, loses itself (Selbstverlorenheit), and\nbecomes self-alienated. At this point, it is argued that when\nintroducing the normative-evaluative sense, Heidegger presents three\nmodes of life: authentic—average(ness)—inauthentic, where\nthe authentic and inauthentic modes are existential modifications of\naverage everydayness (Blattner 2006: 130; Dreyfus\n1991). In this\npicture, an authentic way of life is owned, an inauthentic disowned,\nand the middle one—which is how we live much of the\ntime—is simply one that is unowned. Dasein and authenticity\nemerge in contrast to this background and out of this background, so\nthat the primordially indifferent mode is the condition of possibility\nfor authenticity or inauthenticity. In addition, Carman (2003: 295)\nargues that Heidegger’s notion of conscience can help us further\nillustrate his account of authenticity and shows how the “call\nof conscience” may be interpreted as expressive responsiveness\nto one’s own particularity. Published in 1943, Sartre’s opus magnum, Being and\nNothingness: A Phenomenological Essay on Ontology, had a\nsignificant influence on philosophical thought and intellectual life\nin the second half of the twentieth century. His principal goal in\nthis book is to “repudiate the spirit of\nseriousness” of traditional philosophy as well as of\nbourgeois culture (Sartre 1992a [1943]: 796). The spirit of\nseriousness assumes (1) that there are transcendent values that exist\nantecedently to humans, and (2) that the value of a thing is part of\nthe actual being of the valued thing. Sartre’s view, in contrast, is\nthat all values are generated by human interactions in situations, so\nthat value is a human construct with no extra-human existence in\nthings. To address the question of human existence, Sartre scrutinizes our\neveryday lives, focusing on two particular aspects. He notes that\nhuman beings, like other entities in the world, have certain concrete\ncharacteristics that make up what he calls their\n“facticity” or what they are “in themselves”\n(en soi). Facticity makes up the element of\n“givenness” we must work with: I find myself with a past,\na body and a social situation that constrains me in what I can\ndo. This “just being there” is above all contingent: there\nis no prior justification or reason for the existence of my being. On\nSartre’s view, the “in itself” does not even have any\ndeterminate characteristics, since every determination (every\n“this, not that”) is first introduced into the\ntotality of being by our specific interpretations of things. While human beings share their “facticity” with other\nentities in the world, they are unique among the totality of entities\ninsofar as they are capable of distancing themselves from what is\n“in itself” through reflection and self-awareness. Rather\nthan being an item in the world with relatively fixed attributes, what\nis distinctive about me as a human being is that I am capable of putting\nmy own being in question by asking myself, for example, whether I want\nto be a person of a particular sort. This capacity for gaining\ndistance inserts a “not” or a “nonbeing” into\nthe totality of what is, which allows me to organize what surrounds me\ninto a meaningfully differentiated whole. In addition, human\nconsciousness is the source of the “not” because it is\nitself a “nothingness”. In other words, a human being is\nnot just an “in itself” but also a “for itself\n(pour soi), thus characterized by what Sartre calls\n“transcendence”. As transcendence, I am always more than I\nam as facticity because, as surpassing my brute being, I stand before\nan open range of possibilities for self-definition in the future. Sartre’s notion of transcendence is closely linked with the idea of\nfreedom. Humans are free in the sense that they have the\nability to choose how they are going to interpret things, and in these\ninterpretations they are deciding how things are to count or\nmatter. We constitute the world through our freedom to the extent that\nour ways of taking things determine how reality will be sorted out and\nmatter to us. At the same time, we constitute ourselves\nthrough our own choices: though the facticity of my situation creates\nsome constraints on my possible self-interpretations, it is always up\nto me to decide the meaning of those constraints, and this means that\nwhat I take to be limitations are in fact produced by my own\ninterpretations or meaning-giving activities. Such limitations are\ngrasped in light of antecedent commitments, on the background of which\nsituations becomes intelligible, as affording certain actions and/or\nmodes of evaluation. It is our antecedent commitments that shape our\nworld, making situations and objects intelligible as threatening or\nfavorable, easy or full of obstacles, or more generally, as affording\ncertain actions (Sartre 1992a [1943]: 489). Our engagements provide a\nhermeneutic structure within which our situations and motives become\ncomprehensible and reveal themselves in the way situations appear to\nus—as significant, requiring our attention, etc. (1992a [1943]:\n485). It is important to note that Sartre’s notion of freedom is\nradical. Freedom is absolute to the extent that each person decides\nthe significance of the constraints in his or her facticity: “I\nfind an absolute responsibility for the fact that my facticity\n… is directly inapprehensible”, because supposed\n“facts” about me are never brute facts, “but always\nappear across a projective reconstruction of my for-itself”\n(Sartre 1992a [1943]: 710).  For Sartre, only our choices and their\nprojected ends define our situations as meaningful, as threatening or\nfavorable, as affording certain actions etc. The resistances and\nobstacles that one encounters in a situation acquire meaning only in\nand through the free choice.  Thus, individuals are responsible not\nonly for their identities, but for the way the world presents itself\nin their experiences. Even others are just\n“opportunities and chances” for my free\ncreative activity. According to this early formulation, it is up to us\nto interpret how other people are to matter to us relative to\nsituations in which we find ourselves engaged (Sartre 1992a [1943]:\n711). But human beings are not merely characterized by facticity and\ntranscendence; they are also seen as embodying a deep and\nirreconcilable tension between facticity and transcendence. This\ntension comes to the fore in Sartre’s account of “bad\nfaith”. Bad faith, a kind of self-deception, involves believing\nor taking oneself to be an X while all along one is (and knows\noneself to be) actually a Y. The most familiar form of bad\nfaith is acting as if one were a mere thing—solely\nfacticity—and thereby denying one’s own freedom to make oneself\ninto something very different. Thus, the person who thinks she is a\ncoward “just as a matter of fact” is excluding from view\nthe ability to transform her existence through changed ways of\nbehaving. Such bad faith is a denial of transcendence or freedom. At first, it might seem that one could escape bad faith by making a\nsincere, deep commitment to something and abiding by that\ncommitment—for example, a total, resolute engagement of the self\ncomparable to Kierkegaard’s notion of an “infinite\npassion”. In this regard, Sartre considers a person who tries to\nwholeheartedly believe that his friend really likes\nhim. “I believe it”, he says, “I decide to\nbelieve in it and maintain myself in this decision…”\n(Sartre 1992a [1943]: 114).  My belief will be steady and solid, like\nsomething “in itself” that informs my being and cuts\nthrough all the tenuousness and unsteadiness of my subjective\nlife. I know I believe it, I will say. If I could\nmake myself believe something in this way, then to achieve this might\nbe what we could call “good faith:” to\nactually be something, without the questionability of the\n“not” creeping in. However, Sartre doubts that such an\nabsolute, being-determining commitment is possible. In fact, Sartre\nclaims that any such sort of “good faith” would actually\namount to little more than another form of self-deception. For if my\ndecision to believe is in fact a decision, it must always be something\nthat to some extent distances me from what is decided. That is why we\nuse the word ‘believe’ to imply some degree of\nuncertainty, as when we say, “Is he my friend?  Well,\nI believe he is”. Lucid self-awareness shows us that in\nmaking a choice, we can never attain the condition of the “in\nitself”, because what we are is always in question for us. This\nis what Sartre means when he says human being is always\n“previously corrupted” and that “bad faith [always]\nreapprehends good faith” (Sartre 1992a [1943]: 116). Thus, the\nproject of being in good faith seems impossible, as we are always\nnecessarily in bad faith. The inescapable nature of bad faith seems to leave no room for the\npossibility of authenticity. This might be why the word translated as\n“authentic” only appears twice in this vast tome. On one\noccasion, Sartre attacks Heidegger for introducing the idea of\nauthenticity as a way of providing something foundational in an\notherwise totally contingent world. The concept of authenticity\n“shows all too clearly [Heidegger’s] anxiety to establish an\nontological foundation for an Ethics…” (Sartre 1992a\n[1943]: 128). A second and more obscure appearance of the word comes\nat the end of the discussion of bad faith early in the book. Here\nSartre acknowledges that his account of bad faith seems to have the\nconsequence that there can be no such thing as good faith, so that\n“it is indifferent whether one is in good faith or in bad\nfaith”, and that in turn seems to imply that “we can never\nradically escape bad faith”. Nevertheless, he goes on, there may\nbe a “self-recovery of being which has been previously\ncorrupted”, a recovery “we shall call authenticity, the\ndescription of which has no place here” (Sartre 1992a [1943]:\n116n). One might thus conclude that there is no way to be true to what one\nis, because there is nothing that one is. However, such a negative\nconclusion would be reached only by someone who embraced from the\noutset the “spirit of seriousness” Sartre sets out to\nattack. Seriousness would lead us to think that there is simply a fact\nof the matter about a person: the person is either a believer or he is\nnot. But, as Linda A. Bell (1989: 45) has noted, there is another\npossibility. If one rejects the spirit of seriousness, one might\nlucidly acknowledge that, as transcendence, one’s belief is\nalways in question and so not really a secure belief. Yet, at the same\ntime, one might also recognize that, as facticity, one\ngenuinely holds a belief, and that the belief is central to one’s\nbeing as an engaged agent in this situation. In Sartre’s convoluted\nstyle of formulation, “he would be right if he recognized\nhimself as a being that is what it is not and is not what it is”\n(Bell 1989: 45). On this account, I believe, but I also acknowledge my\nability to retract the belief, since nothing is ever fixed in\nstone. What is suggested here is that a correlate of authenticity can be\nfound in the idea of being true to the inescapable tension at the core\nof the human self. This would be attained if one clear-sightedly\nacknowledged the fundamental ambiguity of the human\ncondition.  Authenticity would then be what Sartre calls a\n“self-recovery of being which was previously corrupted”\n(1992a [1943]: 116). In a sense, humans can never really be\nanything in the way brute objects can be things with determinate\nattributes. In Bell’s words, authenticity would be “the\nawareness and acceptance of—this basic ambiguity” (1989:\n46). This conclusion is supported by Sartre’s later\nwork, Anti-Semite and Jew where he writes, Authenticity, it is almost needless to say,\nconsists in having a true and lucid consciousness of the situation, in\nassuming the responsibilities and risks it involves, in accepting it\n… sometimes in horror and hate. (1948: 90) Lucid recognition of the ambiguity of the human condition is the\nleading idea behind Beauvoir’s The Ethics of Ambiguity.\nBeauvoir takes over Sartre’s characterization of the human condition\nand expands on ideas only hinted at in Sartre’s famous lecture,\n“The Humanism of Existentialism” (1946), in developing a\nconception of authenticity. According to Beauvoir, Sartre’s conception\nof the human being as “engaged freedom” implies not just\nthat each individual finds his or her “reason for being”\nin concrete realizations of freedom, but that willing one’s own\nfreedom necessarily involves willing the freedom of all humans. In\nachieving one’s own freedom, she writes, freedom must also will\n“an open future, by seeking to extend itself by means of the\nfreedom of others” (1948: 60). The point here is that a\ndedication to freedom, when clearly grasped in its full implications,\nwill be seen to call for a future in which an unrestricted range of\npossibilities is open to all. Beauvoir also builds on Sartre’s notion of engagement to\nextend the idea of authenticity. Following Sartre, we are always\nalready engaged in the affairs of the world, whether we realize it or\nnot. To be human is to be already caught up in the midst of social and\nconcrete situations that call for commitments of certain sorts on our\npart. Sartre takes this ground-level fact of engagement as the basis\nfor exhorting us to be engaged in a deeper sense, where this implies\nthat we decisively and wholeheartedly involve ourselves in what the\ncurrent situation demands. Of course, once we have abandoned the\nspirit of seriousness, we will recognize that there are no\nantecedently given principles or values that dictate the proper course\nfor our existential engagement, so that any commitment will be tenuous\nand groundless. But the authentic individual will be the one who takes\nup the terrifying freedom of being the ultimate source of values,\nembraces it, and acts with a clarity and firmness suitable to his or\nher best understanding of what is right in this context. In this way,\nthe conception of authenticity is continuous with the ideal of being\ntrue to ourselves: we are called upon to become, in our concrete\nlives, what we already are in the ontological structure of our\nbeing. This is in agreement with the manner in which Sartre describes the\nconsequences of acting against one’s deepest commitments. There is no doubt that I could have done\notherwise, but that is not the problem. It ought to be formulated like\nthis: could I have done otherwise without perceptibly modifying the\norganic totality of the projects that make up who I am? Sartre goes on to say that the character of the\nact may be such that instead of remaining a purely local and accidental\nmodification of my behavior, it could be effected only by means of a\nradical transformation of my being-in-the-world… In other\nwords: I could have acted otherwise. Agreed. But at what price?\n(Sartre 1992a [1943]: 454) Thus, acting otherwise or, more precisely,\nfailing to act on one’s fundamental commitments, comes at the price of\ntransforming who one is.  This change effectively precludes one from\ncarrying on with an unchanged self-conception. In the last three decades, authors like Taylor (1989, 1991, 1995,\n2007), Ferrara (1993; 1998), Jacob Golomb (1995), Guignon (2004, 2008) and\nVarga (2011a) have attempted to reconstruct authenticity by\nmaintaining that the justified criticism of self-indulgent forms of\nthe idea does not justify the total condemnation of the idea itself\n(see Taylor 1991: 56). Instead of abandoning the notion of\nauthenticity, they attempt to reconstruct it in a manner that leads\nneither to aestheticism nor to atomistic self-indulgence.  In The Ethics of Authenticity, and the more fully\narticulated Sources of the Self, Taylor makes a case for\nretaining the concept of authenticity (and the practices associated\nwith it) on the grounds that the original and undistorted idea of\nauthenticity contains an important element of self-transcendence\n(Taylor 1991: 15; Anderson 1995).  Unsatisfied with the widespread\ncriticism of authenticity as an adequate ethical orientation, Taylor\nsets out to prove that authenticity does not necessarily lead to\naestheticism or self-indulgence: the justified criticism of\nself-indulgent forms of the ideal does not justify the complete\ncondemnation of the ideal itself (Taylor 1991: 56). This would mean\nextricating aestheticism, subjectivism, individualism, and\nself-indulgent interpretations of this ideal from what Taylor (Ibid.:\n15) holds to be an original understanding of that concept as achieving\nself-transcendence (Anderson 1995). Restoring an undistorted version,\nTaylor says, could guard against meaninglessness, which is one of the\n“malaises of modernity” that Taylor regards as tied to\ntrivialized forms of the culture of authenticity. Self-transcendence,\nwhich once was a crucial element in the ideal of authenticity, is\npractically lost from the contemporary version, giving rise to\ncultures of self-absorption, which ultimately deteriorate into the\nmalaise of absurdity. Already in Sources of the Self, Taylor draws attention to\nhow modernism gives birth to a new kind of inward turn that not only\nattempts to overcome the mechanistic conception of the self linked to\ndisengaged reason but also the Romantic ideal of a faultless alignment\nof inner nature and reason. Instead, for the modernists, a turn inward\ndid not mean a turn towards a self that needs articulation. On the contrary, the turn inward may take us\nbeyond the self as usually understood, to a fragmentation of\nexperience which calls our ordinary notions of identity into\nquestion. (Taylor 1989: 462) While in modernism, the turn inward still contained a\nself-transcending moment, the critical point where the ideal of\nauthenticity becomes flattened is when it becomes\n‘contaminated’ by a certain form of\n‘self-determining freedom’ that also contains elements of\ninwardness and unconventionality (Taylor 1991: 38). Self-determining\nfreedom is the idea that I am free when I decide for myself what concerns\nme, rather than being shaped by external influences. It is a standard\nof freedom that obviously goes beyond what has been called negative\nliberty (being free to do what I want without interference by others)\nbecause that is compatible with one’s being shaped and influenced by\nsociety and its laws of conformity. Instead, self-determining freedom\ndemands that one break free of all such external impositions and\ndecide for oneself alone. (Taylor 1991: 27) Not only is self-determining freedom not a necessary part of\nauthenticity, it is also counterproductive because its\nself-centeredness flattens the meanings of lives and fragments\nidentities. For Taylor, the process of articulating an identity\ninvolves adopting a relationship to the good or to what is important,\nwhich is connected to one’s membership in a language community (Taylor\n1989: 34–35). As he clearly states, “authenticity is not\nthe enemy of demands that emanate from beyond the self; it presupposes\nsuch demands” (Taylor 1991: 41). It cannot be up to me to decide\nwhat is important, since this would be self-defeating.  Instead,\nwhatever is important for me must connect to an inter-subjective\nnotion of the good, wherefrom a good part of its normative force\nlastly emanates. In this sense, authenticity simply requires\nmaintaining bonds to collective questions of worth that point beyond\none’s own preferences. Taylor wants to show that modes of contemporary\nculture that opt for self-fulfillment without regard (a) to the demands of our ties with others, or (b)\nto demands of any kind emanating from something more or other than\nhuman desires or aspirations are self-defeating, that they destroy the\nconditions for realizing authenticity itself. (Taylor 1991:\n35) Thus, not only do we need the recognition of concrete others in\norder to form our identities, but we must also (critically) engage\nwith a common vocabulary of shared value orientations. In other words,\nTaylor points out that authenticity needs the appropriation of values\nthat make up our collective horizons. In his Reflective Authenticity, Alessandro Ferrara also\nsets out to defend authenticity as an ideal, but in contrast to Taylor\nhe is interested in the social and philosophical issues of the\nrelation between authenticity and validity. According to Ferrara’s\ndiagnosis, we are currently witnessing a profound transition that,\nbesides affecting cultures, values and norms, also touch on the\n“foundations of validity,” thereby affecting the\n“bedrock of the symbolic network through which we relate to\nreality and reproduce our life-forms” (Ferrara 1998: 1). At the\ncore of this transformation is the reformulation of\n“well-being” (eudaimonia) as the normative ideal\nof authenticity, which can be of help in reconstructing a contemporary\nunderstanding of normativity. For Ferrara, it can ground a new ideal\nof universal validity “ultimately linked with the model of\nexemplary uniqueness or enlightening singularity thus far associated\nwith ‘aesthetics’” (Ferrara 1998: 10). Authenticity\nis then characterized by the “self-congruency” of an\nindividual, collective or symbolic identity (Ferrara 1998: 70), and is\nthought of as providing a new universal validity that does not build\non the generalizable but rather on the exemplary. Ferrara views\nSimmel’s idea of an individual law as an instructive example of such\nan anti-generalizing universalism, and it is exactly this\ncharacteristic that makes it better suited to the pluralist contexts\nfaced by modern Western societies. More recently, Ferrara (2019) has argued that authenticity currently faces a “dual paradox” and is misconstrued by many critics  advocating its deconstructionist dismissal. Golomb (1995) provides an informative historical overview of the\ngenesis and development of the concept of authenticity, paying\nattention to both literary and philosophical sources. While\ncontinuously reminding us of the inherently social dimension of\nauthenticity, one of the achievements here is the focus on boundary\nsituations where authenticity “is best forged and\nrevealed” (Ibid.: 201). Golomb takes a neutral position on the\nethical value of authenticity, maintaining that “there is no\nreason to suppose that it is any better or any more valuable to be\nauthentic than to act inauthentically” (Ibid.: 202). Guignon (2004) explores both the philosophical roots of\nauthenticity and its contemporary manifestations in popular\nculture. He thoughtfully criticizes pop-psychological literature that\ndeals with the authentic life by making recourse to the subdued\n‘inner child’. Since Rousseau, the dichotomy between\nauthentic and inauthentic has often been interpreted akin to the\ndistinction between child and adult (Guignon 2004: 43). Like the inner\nchild, the authentic self is depicted as not yet corrupted by the\npressures, competitiveness, and conformity of modern public\nlife. Guignon draws on the psychoanalytic theories of Freud and Jung\nto remind us of less romanticized visions of the inner\nchild. Additionally, Guignon (2004: 151) aims to identify the manner\nin which authenticity can be understood as being at the same time a\npersonal and a “fundamentally and irreducibly” social\nvirtue. Authenticity then involves reflectively discerning what is\nreally worth pursuing in the social context in which the agent is\nsituated (Ibid.: 155). If the ideal of authenticity is possible only\nin a free society with a solid foundation of established social\nvirtues, it would seem that trying to be authentic, if it is to be\ncoherent, must involve a commitment to sustaining and nurturing the\ntype of society in which such an ideal is possible. A reflection on\nthe social embodiment of virtues therefore suggests that authenticity,\nlike many other character ideals, carries with it an obligation to\ncontribute to the maintenance and well-being of a particular type of\nsocial organization and way of life (Guignon 2008: 288; 2004: 161). On\nthe other hand, Guignon (2004, 2008) argues that in a democratic\nsociety, in which the authority of government—in setting the\npolitical course—stems from the consent of the governed, there\nis good reason to promote virtues like authenticity that sustain such\nan organization of government. To be authentic is to be clear about\none’s own most basic feelings, desires and convictions, and to openly\nexpress one’s stance in the public arena. But that capacity is\nprecisely the character trait that is needed in order to be an\neffective member of a democratic society (Guignon 2008: 288).  Varga (2011a) shares the fundamental assumption that authenticity\nhas a certain potential (and therefore deserves to be reformulated),\nbut he also thinks that it could be used for a critical inquiry into\nthe practices of the self in contemporary life. By way of an analysis\nof self-help and self-management literature, Varga detects a\n“paradoxical transformation:” the ideal of authenticity\nthat once provided an antidote to hierarchical institutions and\nrequirements of capitalism, now seems to function both as an\ninstitutionalized demand towards subjects to match the systemic\ndemands of contemporary capitalism and as a factor in the economic\nutilization of subjective capacities.  Varga argues that it is in\n“existential” choices that we express who we are, and that\nthese have a complex phenomenology characterized by a sense of\nnecessity. In such choices, described as “alternativeless\nchoices”, we articulate who we are, bringing into reality some\ntacit intuitions that often only take on a gestalt-like formation. In\nthese cases, we both discover who we are “on the inside”,\nand actively constitute ourselves. Varga’s examination of the\nstructure of our commitments culminates in the claim that the internal\nstructure of our commitments commits us to more than what we happen to\ncare about. In many cases it may actually commit us to publicly\nintelligible values that we take our commitments to embody—an\naspect that may constrain the manner of our practical deliberation and\nthe way in which we can pursue our commitments (Varga 2011a,b). Along similar lines, Bauer (2017) defends authenticity as an ethical ideal, arguing that the ideal should understood as the combination of the ideal of expressing one’s individual personality and the ideal of being an autonomous and morally responsible person. Others have argued that authenticity might require more than living in accord with commitments that one wholeheartedly endorses. For example, Rings (2017) highlights an epistemic criterion. The point is that the commitments in question have to be chosen in light of an acknowledgment of facts concerning one’s personal history and present context. Thus, self-knowledge might matter more than hitherto recognized, even if the self-relation most pertinent to authenticity is not primarily of an epistemic nature.  \n","contact.mail":"varga@cas.au.dk","contact.domain":"cas.au.dk"}]
