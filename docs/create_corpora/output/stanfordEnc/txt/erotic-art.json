Do all paintings with a sexual theme qualify as\nerotic? How to distinguish between erotica and erotic art? In what way\nare aesthetic experiences related to, or different from, erotic\nexperiences and are they at all compatible? Both people and works of\nart can be sensually appealing, but is the beauty in each case\nsubstantially the same? How helpful is the distinction\nbetween the nude and the naked? Can we draw a strict line between\nerotic art and pornography? We tend to think of art as complex and of\npornography as one-dimensional, but how compelling is that differentiation?\nPornography is often considered harmful, objectifying, and\nexploitative, but to what extent is erotic art immune to moral\ncriticism of this sort? In addressing such questions this entry will\nprovide an overview of current philosophical debates on erotic art. It\nwill also place those debates in historical perspective and, in the\nclosing section, explore some important avenues for future\nresearch.\n\nIn Sex and Reason, Richard Posner proposes to use the word\n“erotic” to describe   presentations and representations that are, or at\nleast are taken by some viewers to be, in some sense\n“about” sexual activity. (Posner 1994:\n351)  \nThis characterization needs some narrowing down if one wants to arrive\nat a definition that captures the extension of what we ordinarily\nthink counts as erotic art. For one thing, an extensionally adequate\ndefinition should exclude scientific-behavioral studies or medical\nillustrations of sexual activity (which tend to be neither erotic nor\nartistic in nature). Furthermore, it’s not the case, simply because\nsome viewers take a painting or a sculpture to be about sexual\nactivity, that we are ipso facto dealing with an erotic\nrepresentation.  Someone who is unfamiliar with the story of the Christian Bible\nmight take a crucifixion painting to be a depiction of a\nsado-masochistic act, but that would be insufficient grounds to call,\nsay, Tintoretto’s Crucifixion (1565)\na work of erotic art. Peter Webb’s definition of erotic art as   art on a sexual theme related specifically to emotions\nrather than merely actions, and sexual depictions which are\njustifiable on aesthetic grounds (Webb 1975: 2)  \nis already closer to the mark. But even though Webb’s emphasis on\nemotions is understandable from an etymological point of\nview—the term “erotic” derives from the Greek word\n“eros” meaning love or passion—he does not succeed\nin spelling out the necessary or sufficient conditions for erotic\nart.  Man Ray’s photograph The Prayer\n(1930) shows only the hands, feet, and buttocks of a woman; it is not\na sexual depiction in the strict sense and there is no show of\nemotions. Still, it is widely considered to be an erotic\nmasterpiece. Conversely, Ian McEwan’s novella On\nChesil Beach, set in the early 1960s and telling the story\nof a wedding night that goes horribly wrong, does qualify as\n“art on a sexual theme related specifically to emotions”\nand yet it would be misleading to label it as erotic literature. Instead of claiming that erotic art is about sexual\nfeelings or desires, one could say that erotic art elicits\nsexual feelings or desires. But this characterization would also be\ntoo broad. A pious Madonna and Child painting may elicit sexual\nfeelings or desires in some people, but that in and of itself does not\nmake it erotic art. The intention to be sexually stimulating\nappears crucial, as Jerrold Levinson acknowledges in his definition of\nerotic art as   art which aims to engage viewers sexually through\nexplicit sexual content, and that succeeds, to some extent, in doing\nso. (Levinson 2006: 252) \nBut does erotic art need to be explicit? Take Nobuyoshi Araki’s\nfamous close-up photograph of a woman’s eye, sometimes\nentitled The Look. The artist has\ntilted the picture 90 degrees to make it suggestive of female\ngenitalia, thereby soliciting sensuous feelings and associations in\nspectators. It is highly erotic, though it has no explicit sexual\ncontent. A more adequate definition, and one that will be adhered to in this\narticle, is the following: erotic art is art that is made with the\nintention to stimulate its target audience sexually, and that succeeds\nto some extent in doing so. This raises the further question what\nsexual stimulation precisely entails. According to Guy Sircello (1979:\n119) it is the inducing of sexual feelings where the latter might be\n(1) feelings in our sexual parts, or (2) feelings in other erogenous\nparts—typically generated by or generating feelings in sexual\nparts. However, a kick below the belt will give a man certain feelings\nin his sexual parts, but not of the sort that erotic art is supposed\nto bring about. So, an important qualification is needed. Sexual\nstimulation is probably best understood as the inducing of sexual\nfeelings, desires and imaginings, that would generally be regarded\nas pleasant in themselves. Alternatively, one could adopt\nMatthew Kieran’s nutshell definition of erotic art as art which\n“essentially aims at eliciting sexual thoughts, feelings and\nassociations found to be arousing” (2001: 32). Levinson (2005) makes a useful distinction between erotic art and\nwhat he calls erotica, that is, images intended to sexually\nstimulate but not to reward artistic interest (such as provocative\nlingerie ads). In general, it is good to keep in mind that the domain\nof erotic art only constitutes a small subsection of the much larger\nclass of items that are called erotic (erotic massages, erotic games,\nerotic toys, etc.). Erotic art also seems to fall within the broader\ncategory of sexually themed art. All works of erotic art have\na sexual theme, it could be argued, but not the other way around: many\nartworks with a sexual theme are not works of erotic art. Ian\nMcEwan’s On Chesil Beach has already been mentioned.  Another\nexample might be Tracey Emin’s Is Anal Sex\nLegal? (1998), which simply consists of that question writ\nlarge in pink neon light. (The piece is usually exhibited together\nwith its complement, Is Legal Sex Anal?\nalso from 1998). Sexually themed art should be distinguished from sexually\nstimulating art, i.e., art that stimulates its target audience\nsexually, even though it may not have had the aim to do so.  While\nsome may find it difficult to think of any examples in this category,\nSircello argues on phenomenological grounds that everything that is\ntruly beautiful, and hence every work of art that is truly beautiful,\nwill be experienced as sexually titillating. For instance, when he\nstudies The Burghers of Calais, with\nits stooped and despondent old men,   the beauty of Rodin’s restless surface leads me\n… to rub that glorious bronze, and once again comes that warmth\nin the testicles, that stirring in the penis, that itch in the nipples\nand the tongue. (1979: 225) \nSimilarly,   when I inspect the austere and meticulous Zurbaran\nstill life, notice the painstaking precision of its details …\n(I) feel forthwith those stirrings in the groin. (1979:\n225) \nHowever, while Sircello judges his arousal to be “neither\nabnormal nor idiosyncratic” and to be fully “appropriate\nand natural” (1979: 226) not everyone might agree with that\nassessment. The counterpart of sexually stimulating art is failed erotic\nart (or as Levinson 2006 would have it “nominally erotic\nart”): art that aims but does not succeed in stimulating its\ntarget audience sexually (see also Mag Uidhir 2010). Anti-erotic\nart, on the other hand, is art that aims to\ninduce negative sexual feelings, thoughts, and imaginings in\nits target audience.  Otto Dix’s Old Couple\n(1923) or George Grosz’s Sex Murder in\nthe Ackerstrasse (1916–7) could serve as\nillustrations. More recently, feminist artists such as Kiki Smith have\nexplored the dark, violent, abject aspects of sexuality in their work\n(see, for instance, Smith’s Tale,\n1992, and Blood Pool,\n1992).  Finally, because censorship and moral policing have often prevented\nartists from making work that is openly erotic, it is worth drawing\nattention to the existence of covertly erotic art, that is,\nart made with the covert intention to stimulate its target\naudience sexually and that succeeds to some extent in doing so. A good\nexample are the so called “sukashi shunga” (hidden shunga)\nthat were popular in Japan at the beginning of the 20th\ncentury. Shunga are woodblock prints, often created by Japan’s leading\nartists, depicting highly erotic scenes. While there were already\nregulations in the early 18th century against the\ndistribution of shunga, it was only at the end of the 19th\ncentury, in the wake of Japan’s increasing openness towards the West,\nthat censorship laws were really being enforced. As a result, hidden\n(see-through) shunga prints were designed to escape the strict eye of\nthe censor. What at first sight appear to be beautifully drawn\npostcards depicting landscapes with some space in the middle and at\nthe corners to write one’s message, when held up to the light, turn\nout to be sexually explicit lovemaking scenes (Aki 2013: 47). An\nexample of an entirely different kind might\nbe Vermeer’s Milk Maid\n(1657–58). Given that milk maids had a reputation for\nsexual availability in 17th century Holland, some scholars have argued\nthat the painting has a covert erotic message, with the foot warmer on\nthe floor suggesting feminine desire (because foot warmers would heat\nnot only the feet but everything under a woman’s skirt) and one of the\nDelft tiles in the scene depicting Cupid, while another tile shows a\ntraveling man possibly suggesting that the maid is thinking of an\nabsent lover (Liedtke 2009). Are there überhaupt any works of erotic art? This may seem\na silly question, especially to anyone who is familiar with art\nhistory and with the well-established tradition of erotic art in\nparticular. But to students of modern aesthetics, that is, the\nphilosophy of art and beauty from roughly the beginning of the\n18th century to the end of the 19th century,\nthat question will not appear absurd at all. Modern aesthetics famously built a wall between aesthetic pleasure,\non the one hand, and sensual or sexual pleasures, on the other hand,\nleaving precious little room for works that aim to combine the\ntwo. The problem becomes clear when we consider Immanuel Kant’s\nCritique of Judgment (1790), arguably the most central and\ninfluential work of that period. According to Kant, a pure aesthetic\njudgment is based entirely on a feeling of disinterested pleasure,\ni.e., a pleasure that does not depend on or generate a desire for the\nobject. But since works of erotic art are meant precisely to tap into\nand stimulate our sexual appetites and desires, it is hard to see how\nthey can be the object of an aesthetic judgment. They are rather\nprimed to be the object of what Kant calls a judgment of the\nagreeable, based on an “interested pleasure”, in this case\nthe titillation provided by the alluring depictions of attractive\nbodies and seductive poses. The sensual pleasure offered by such\nrepresentations is very different from the enjoyment that occurs in an\naesthetic experience and which results from the free play of the\ncognitive faculties of imagination and understanding. According to\nKant, it is because aesthetic judgments are grounded not in any\ninterest, but rather in the subjective conditions of cognition, which\nare shared by all rational beings, that they can lay claim to\nuniversality. The pleasure solicited by erotic art can obviously not\nlay claim to such universality since it will depend on one’s sexual\npreferences and inclinations. Kant was not the first to introduce disinterestedness as hallmark\nof the aesthetic and isolate it as such from what is merely sensually\nor sexually appealing. Anthony Ashley Cooper, the third Earl of\nShaftesbury, is often credited with this insight. In\nhis Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times (1711)\nShaftesbury already stated that the response solicited by beauty is\none of rational and refined contemplation, far removed from the crude\npleasures that we receive through our senses. A problem that immediately arises for Shaftesbury’s account is the\none posed by the “dazzling form” of a beautiful woman\n(1964 [1711]: 136). Here, beauty and sensual appeal, far from being\nantithetical, actually seem to go hand in hand. Still, Shaftesbury\ninsists that the two kinds of pleasure are utterly distinct, even\nthough, in this particular case, erotic pleasure may indeed follow in\nthe wake of aesthetic pleasure. One could make a comparison, he\nwrites, with someone who goes from contemplating the beauty of a tree\nto fantasizing about its tasty fruits. Both activities are\npleasurable, but the pleasures involved are very different: one is a\ndisinterested aesthetic pleasure, the other is a pleasure informed by\nour self-interest. It points to a sensual joy, based on an appetite\nthat we have in common with animals, or “brutes” as\nShaftesbury prefers to call them. The contemplation of beauty, by\ncontrast, is unique to us rational beings. That’s because beauty is\nexclusively an object of the mind. But can one really draw the distinction in such absolute terms?\nWhen we admire an attractive man or woman, isn’t it precisely\ntheir beauty that activates the senses and gives rise to\ncertain bodily passions? And if so, doesn’t this prove that the two\nare intimately linked? Shaftesbury dismisses this line of thought\nalmost out of hand. After all, we wouldn’t say that it is\nthe beauty of the fruit that attracts and brings joy to the\nprowling animal in search of food; or that it is the beauty of the\nfood served at the dinner table that makes us humans hungry. What\nwhets and satisfies appetite of both humans and animals is not the\nstriking form, but what lies beneath that striking form, that which is\nmere matter.  (Accordingly, the more a mouthwatering dish or body is\nviewed, the further they are from satisfying by mere view.) Just as it\nis not the material that makes a sculpture beautiful, but rather the\nartistic intentions and designs that shape the material, so it is not\nthe body in itself, something that is mere matter, that is\nbeautiful:   What is it you admire but mind, or the\neffect of mind? Tis mind alone which forms. All which is void of mind\nis horrid, and matter formless is deformity itself. (1964 [1711]:\n132) \nMind is the only true object of beauty. Moreover, it is\nonly through the mind that beauty can be apprehended and\nappreciated, for if animals can’t know and enjoy beauty precisely\nbecause they have only senses, it follows that man can’t conceive or\nenjoy beauty through his senses (the “brutish part”). It is evident that, for Shaftesbury, erotic art, which is all about\npresenting desirable bodies and stirring up sensual pleasures, can\nhave no legitimate place within the realm of the aesthetic. Yet, apart\nfrom a brief passage in which he denounces the “self-improving\nartist” who makes a fortune by “studying bodies”\n(1964 [1711]: 144), Shaftesbury does not explicitly criticize or\nattack any kind of art or artist. (Like Kant, his primary focus is not\nart, but beauty.) Someone who does explicitly take up such a critical\nstance, however, is Arthur Schopenhauer. If Shaftesbury is the\nphilosopher who inspired Kant to develop the theory of\ndisinterestedness, then Schopenhauer is the philosopher who, inspired\nby Kant, has taken this notion of disinterestedness and worked it up\ninto a fully-fledged philosophy of art.  This is not the place to discuss all the minutiae of\nSchopenhauer’s The World as Will and Representation\n(1818). Crucial, for our purposes, is his concept of “das\nReizende”, which will here be translated as “the\nstimulating.” The stimulating is “that which excites the\nwill by directly presenting to it satisfaction, fulfillment”\n(Schopenhauer 1969 [1818]: 207). It ought to be shunned at all price\nin art, says Schopenhauer, because it  draws the beholder down from pure contemplation, demanded by every\napprehension of the beautiful, since it necessarily stirs his will by\nobjects that directly appeal to it. Thus the beholder no longer\nremains pure subject of knowing, but becomes the needy and dependent\nsubject of willing.  (Schopenhauer 1969 [1818]: 207) This is contrary to the aim of art, which is to facilitate\nwill-less contemplation of the Ideas.  Schopenhauer is quite specific about what the stimulating consists\nin:   In historical painting and in sculpture (it) consists\nin nude figures, the position, semi-drapery, and whole treatment of\nwhich are calculated to excite lustful feeling in the beholder. (1969\n[1818]: 207–8) \nIt is important to note that he does not object to depicting the nude\nfigure as such—after all, “the ancients” did so\n“almost always free from … fault”\n(ibid.). What he objects to is a\nparticular treatment of the nude, one which is designed to\nexcite lustful feelings in the beholder. In other words, what he\ntargets and denounces is erotic art. Like Shaftesbury and Kant he is\ndrawn to make a comparison with food. Fruit is admissible as a\nsubject matter for paintings   for it exhibits itself as a further development of the\nflower, and as a beautiful product of nature through form and colour,\nwithout our being positively forced to think of its\nedibility. (ibid.: 207–8) \nBut what is not admissible are prepared and served-up dishes,\ndepicted with a high degree of realism. Dutch still life paintings\ndepicting oysters, herrings, crabs, bread, butter, beer, wine, excite\nthe appetite and are objectionable for the exact same reasons as\nerotic paintings and sculptures, which excite sexual appetite, are\nobjectionable: they stimulate the will and as such put an end to any\naesthetic contemplation of the object. Given that the function of art\nis to facilitate aesthetic experience, it follows for Schopenhauer\nthat “the stimulating … is everywhere to be avoided in\nart” (ibid: 208; see also Neill 2012). Modern aesthetics has cast a long shadow into the 20th\nand even the 21st century, and the idea that the aesthetic\nand the erotic are fundamentally incompatible has proved to be very\ninfluential throughout. Clive Bell, the great champion of aesthetic formalism, inscribes\nhimself neatly in that tradition. In his landmark book, Art\n(1914), he begins by drawing a sharp contrast between the aesthetic\nemotion, which is provoked by works of art in virtue of a certain\npleasing combination of lines and colors, and sexual feelings and\ndesires which are provoked by sensually appealing bodies. The two\ncould not be more different, he thinks:   let no one imagine, because he has made merry in the\nwarm tilth and quaint nooks of romance, that he can even guess at the\naustere and thrilling raptures of those who have climbed the cold,\nwhite peaks of art. (1961 [1914]: 42) \nNevertheless, Bell acknowledges, as did Shaftesbury, that the two\nemotions are often confused partly because in everyday speech the\nword “beauty” is used indiscriminately for items that\nfall in each of the two categories (beautiful works of art,\nattractive men and women). To prevent any further confusion, he\ninsists therefore on using the word “significant form,”\ninstead of beauty, for the combination of lines and colors that\nproduces the aesthetic emotion. (Shaftesbury, one will recall, was\nrevisionist in the opposite direction, refusing to employ the word\nbeauty for that which is merely desirable.) What about those works of art that appeal to our sensual feelings\nand desires and that are so popular with the man in the street? The art that they call “beautiful” is generally closely\nrelated to the women. A beautiful picture is a photograph of a pretty\ngirl; beautiful music, the music that provokes emotions similar to\nthose provoked by young ladies in musical farces; and beautiful\npoetry, the poetry that recalls the same emotions felt, twenty years\nearlier, for the rector’s daughter. (1961 [1914]:\n28–29) Bell has no patience with ignorant folks who seek out pictures,\npoems, or music for these reasons. They are simply confusing the\nsensual and the aesthetic. Of course, this does not mean that\npaintings depicting pretty girls cannot be art. They can, but if they\nare art, they will be so despite their erotic content. For\nexample, when Manet’s Olympia, a\npicture of a prostitute, caused a storm of indignation in Paris of the\n1860s, Emile Zola defended the painting in terms that Bell would have\napproved of: Tell them aloud, dear master, that you are not what they think you\nare, that a painting is for you a mere pretext for analysis.  You\nneeded … clear and luminous tones, and you introduced a\nbouquet; you needed black tones and you placed in a corner a Negress\nand a cat. (Zola 1991: 161) For Bell and his fellow formalists, significant form is the only\nimportant artistic criterion. Where it comes to insulating the\naesthetic from the erotic, many prominent philosophers in the\n20th century have followed in Bell’s footsteps, even when\nthey do not subscribe to his formalism. In The Principles of\nArt (1938), R. G. Collingwood observes how “the words\n‘beauty’, ‘beautiful’, as actually used, have\nno aesthetic implication” since they often indicate “the\nsatisfaction of some desire or the arousing of some emotion”\n(1938: 38–41). For Collingwood, a beautiful man or woman\nordinarily means one whom we find sexually desirable. And he firmly\nstates that this “has nothing whatever to do with aesthetic\nexperience. It has to do with that other kind of experience that Plato\ncalled eros” (1938: 41). Similarly, Monroe Beardsley\ninsisted on a strict divide between the two sorts of responses and\nrevised his theory of aesthetic experience when it was pointed out to\nhim that it did not exclude sexual experiences from the realm of the\naesthetic (Beardsley 1982). Edward Bullough famously posited\n“psychical distance” as a prerequisite for experiencing\nart and concluded that  explicit references to organic affections, …\nespecially to sexual matters, lie normally below the Distance-limit,\nand can be touched on by Art only with special precautions. (1969:\n403) Even in the 21st century one will find philosophers who\nare deeply sceptical about the aesthetic and artistic potential of the\nerotic. Mohan Matthen, for instance, states that “erotic art\ntends not to be great art” because   even when erotica are artistic … they have too\ndirect an effect on sexual response, and this distracts the viewer’s\nattention away from the work itself. (2011: 354) \nThe more erotic a work of art, the more difficult it is to appreciate\naesthetically. Matthen makes this claim in an essay review of The\nArt Instinct (2009), a book on evolutionary aesthetics written\nby Denis Dutton, who also claims that eroticism is best avoided in\nart, though for different reasons than Matthen. While the latter\nconsiders the sexual response too distracting, Dutton argues that it\nis rather too crude and too basic to count as a proper aesthetic\nresponse. A high degree of meaning-complexity is the hallmark of all\ngreat art, according to Dutton, but while love is complex,\n“(s)ex itself is just too simple” (2009: 238). As a\nconsequence,   love is the most pervasive theme for representative\narts everywhere, (whereas) explicit eroticism does not tend to figure\nimportantly in the greatest masterpieces. (2009: 238) \nJust like a bowl of corn syrup and a plate of sugar will never be\ndinner, Dutton flippantly observes, erotic paintings, novels, and\npoems will never qualify as art of the highest order. (It is\ncertainly noteworthy that Dutton, who is the antipode of modern\naesthetics in doing away with the very notion of a disinterested\npleasure and assuming that matters of sexual reproduction are vital\nin explaining our interest in art and aesthetics, actually finds\nhimself in the company of Schopenhauer, Kant, and Shaftesbury where\nerotic art is concerned.) To recapitulate: if (disinterested, contemplative) aesthetic\nresponses are indeed irreconcilable with (interested, bodily) sexual\nresponses, as so many philosophers of art in the past have thought,\nthen there hardly remains any conceptual space for works that aim for\nboth kinds of response. Yet, we do, as a matter of fact, have this\nlongstanding tradition of erotic art, not just in the West but also in\nmany non-Western cultures. How to account for this? Proponents of modern aesthetics could simply bite the bullet here\nand argue, as Mohan Matthen does, that erotic art tends not to be\ngreat art, or, following Bell, that erotic paintings, books, poems can\nonly attain art status despite their erotic content. But that is a\nbig bullet to bite, by any standard. Not only are there so many\noutstanding works of erotic art, but the eroticism of these works is\nalso more often than not an integral part of their status and value as\nart. To be sure, there are nude paintings and sculptures which seem to\nqualify first and foremost as studies in formal beauty (certain\nsculptures of Henry Moore come to mind). But anyone who would regard,\nsay, the Rokeby Venus by Velázquez\n(c. 1647–51) or The Naked Maja\nby Goya (c. 1797–1800) as a mere formal exercise would\nentirely misunderstand and fail to appreciate what these works are\nabout. That is why the great majority of aestheticians today prefer\nthe other horn of the dilemma. Instead of denying the existence of\ngenuinely erotic art, they will deny that aesthetic and erotic\nresponses are antithetical and hence reject the basic tenets of modern\naesthetics. Modern aesthetics and its 20th century formalist and\nexperientialist heirs have been criticized from many sides. But\ninstead of offering a general critique, let us consider briefly some\nof the philosophers who, in attacking modern aesthetics, have\nexplicitly pleaded for the inclusion of the sexual within the domain\nof aesthetics.  One of the most vehement early critics was Friedrich Nietzsche. In\nan oft-quoted passage in On the Genealogy of Morals (1887:\nIII.6) Nietzsche shifts attention to the artist’s point of view to\nreveal a fundamental flaw in modern aesthetics:   When our aestheticians tirelessly rehearse, in support\nof Kant’s view, that the spell of beauty enables us to view even nude\nfemale statues “disinterestedly” we may be allowed to\nlaugh a little at their expense. The experiences of artists in this\ndelicate matter are rather more “interesting”; certainly\nPygmalion was not entirely devoid of aesthetic\nfeeling. \n(NB: For Nietzsche’s texts we have relied on the classic edition of\nColli & Montinari, 1967–78. On the Genealogy of\nMorals is abbreviated as GM, The Will to Power is\nabbreviated as WP, and Twilight of the Idols is abbreviated\nas TI. The translations we have used are listed in the\nbibliography) Pygmalion fell under the spell of the beautiful statue he had\ncreated, but his enjoyment was certainly not bereft of any desire. For\nNietzsche, the case of Pygmalion is not exceptional, but rather\nemblematic: “All art works tonically, increases strength,\ninflames desire” (WP §809). And, as he writes\nin Twilight of the Idols (1889),   all beauty incites to procreation—…\nprecisely this is the proprium of its effect, from the most\nsensual regions up into the most spiritual…. (TI\nIX.22) \nTo believe, as Schopenhauer, Kant, Shaftesbury seem to have done,\nthat in matters of beauty and art there is such a thing as\n“immaculate perception” (an aesthetic regard pure of any\ndesire), is simply to deceive oneself. Far from building a wall between the aesthetic and the sexual,\nNietzsche sees them as intimately linked: “The demand for art\nand beauty is an indirect demand for the ecstasies of sexuality”\n(WP §805). The two experiences really share the same structure\nand phenomenology. As with sexual experience, if there is to be\n“any aesthetic doing or seeing, one physiological condition is\nindispensable: rapture” (TI IX, 8). And the pleasure that one\nreceives is not a disembodied, cognitive pleasure—a unique kind\nof experience that would set us apart from animals. No, art reminds (us) of states of animal vigour: it is on the one hand\nan excess and overflow of blooming corporeality into the\nworld of images and desires: on the other, an excitation of the animal\nfunctions through the images and desires of intensified life. (WP\n§802) Thus, while the erotic masterpieces of the past must qualify as\nregrettable anomalies for someone like Schopenhauer, Nietzsche has no\ntrouble at all in giving them a place. Within contemporary aesthetics, Alexander Nehamas and Richard\nShusterman are perhaps the two most high-profile philosophers to have\nmade a serious and sustained effort to make room for the erotic within\naesthetics and art. In the first few pages of his book Only a\nPromise of Happiness (2007), Nehamas lays his cards on the table.\nMentioning Kant and Schopenhauer as his adversaries, he states\nuncompromisingly that “the only reaction appropriate to beauty\nis eros—love, the desire to possess it” (2007:\n6).  While eros should not necessarily be understood in a\nsexual sense here, Nehamas does think that erotic encounters provide\nan instructive model for aesthetic experiences in general:   The most abstract and intellectual beauty provokes the\nurge to possess it no less than the most sensual inspires the passion\nto come to know it better. (2007: 7) \nEach judgment of beauty is future oriented, is identical with the\nspark of desire, and contains, in the words of Stendhal, a promise of\nhappiness (Stendhal 1926: 74; Nehamas 2007: 55). For Nehamas, too, erotic art is not at all a recalcitrant exception\nin need of explanation. Quite the contrary, it offers the best\npossible inroad to understanding what beauty and art are all\nabout. It’s not a coincidence that the touchstone work of art, to\nwhich Nehamas returns again and again, is\nManet’s Olympia. Far from being an exercise in formal beauty,\nas Zola would have it, this is a painting that is precisely\ndesigned   to jolt the audience, especially the men, into\nacknowledging that what they were enjoying was not a painted canvas or\nan idealized figure with an edifying message but a naked woman of\ntheir own place and time. (Nehamas 2007: 27) \nIt is erotic in every sense of the word and for Nehamas it does what\nall great art should do: spark the audience’s desire. If Nehamas mainly takes issue with the disavowal of desire within\nmodern aesthetics, Richard Shusterman’s main target is the\n“idealist-rationalist repugnance for the body” which he\nfinds is permeating the entire tradition of Western philosophy (2005:\n324; see also Irvin (ed.) 2016). To counter this, Shusterman proposes a new discipline,\n“somaesthetics,” which aims to study the “experience\nand use of one’s body as a locus of sensory-aesthetic appreciation and\ncreative self-fashioning” (1999: 302) and which has as one of\nits main subsidiary ambitions to “(i)mprove our appreciation of\nthe artistry, beauty, meaning that sexual experience can offer”\n(2008: 85). In several of his essays he argues that sexual experience\nitself can qualify as an aesthetic experience, since most of the\ncrucial features attributed to aesthetic experiences are also\nattributable to erotic experiences: they are pursued and valued for\ntheir own sake, they are rich in intensity and stand out distinctively\nfrom the flow of ordinary humdrum experience, they display harmonies\nof structure and developing form, they are being subjectively savored\nbut also intentionally directed at an object, they deeply engage\nthought, feeling, and imagination, and stimulate both body and mind\n(2007: 57, 2008: 93). Hence, instead of ignoring or disenfranchising\nthe tradition of erotic art, Shusterman pleads for the reassertion of\nan “ars erotica” which would not just involve a renewed\nattention for certain works of the past, but would entail the\ndevelopment of genuine erotic art forms that could help increase our\nunderstanding of the relation between aesthetics and sex, deliver\naesthetically rewarding erotic experiences, and deepen our\nappreciation of the aesthetic potential of other somatic practices\n(2007: 57). While not everyone will take the aesthetic recuperation of the\nerotic as far as Shusterman and Nehamas, very few philosophers today\nwill deny the existence and aesthetic legitimacy of erotic art. So, does this\nmean that the wall between the sexual and the aesthetic has been torn\ndown? Not entirely. It seems more accurate to say that the battle\nlines have been redrawn. The suspicion towards the erotic may have\nlargely subsided in contemporary aesthetics, but it has been replaced\nby a very pronounced scepticism of the pornographic. Many philosophers\nof art, including Roger Scruton, Jerrold Levinson, and Christy Mag\nUidhir, deny that there is (or can be) such a thing as pornographic\nart. In other words, they advocate a strict divide between erotic art\nand pornography. Some of their scepticism, one cannot fail to notice,\nbears a significant resemblance to the earlier resistance against\nerotic art. Pornographic representations are sexually explicit and rich in\nanatomical detail, Scruton points out, whereas works of erotic art\nrely on suggestion and, instead of focusing on certain body parts,\nwill try to capture the individuality, personality, and subjectivity\nof the represented person. In Titian’s Venus of\nUrbino (1538), for instance, it is not the sexual organs\nbut the face, as “window to the soul,” that provides the\nfocus of attention (1986: 154, 2005: 11, 2009: 149). A pornographic\nimage, by contrast, “is like a magic wand that turns subjects\ninto objects, people into things—and thereby disenchants them,\ndestroying the source of their beauty” (2009: 163). As part of\nhis project to rehabilitate beauty as the central aesthetic and\nartistic category, Scruton also appeals to the distinction between\n“the nude” and “the naked” made famous by\nKenneth Clark (1956). The artistic nude constitutes, as the subtitle\nof Clark’s book indicates, a “Study in Ideal Form”: the\nbody is beautifully shaped and framed by the conventions of art. The\npeople in pornographic images are not nude, but naked. They are\ndeprived of clothes, and as such exposed in an embarrassing\nway. Furthermore, while the Titian nude retains a detached serenity,\npornography arouses the viewer, which is always “an aesthetic\ndefect, a “fall” into another kind of interest than that\nwhich has beauty as its target” (2009: 160).  Levinson also wishes to separate erotic art from pornography in\nterms of the kind of response they call for, yet his argument is\nmarkedly different from Scruton’s. Here’s a summary of Levinson’s\nargument:  Elsewhere in the article Levinson makes it clear that by\n“R1” he means aesthetic delight or aesthetic experience\nand that “R2” refers to sexual arousal and release: the aims of true pornography and the aims of art, erotic art\nincluded, are not compatible, but war against one another (…).\nOne induces you, in the name of arousal and release, to ignore the\nrepresentation so as to get at the represented, the other induces you,\nin the name of aesthetic delight, to dwell on the\nrepresentation. (2005: 234) This has been the single most influential argument in recent\ndebates on the relation between erotic art and pornography, winning\nmany supporters (Matthen 2011; Nanay 2012; Neill 2012) but also\nattracting a substantial amount of criticism (see, for instance, Kania\n2012; Davies 2012; van Brabandt and Prinz 2012; Patridge 2013). While\none may want to challenge some of Levinson’s premises (as Maes 2009\ndoes in a systematic way), one could also question whether his rather\nradical conclusion really follows from said premises. After all, it\nseems that one can (coherently and successfully) aim at\nincompatible audience responses, as long as one does not expect these\nresponses to be elicited at the same time, in the same audience (see\nMaes 2011). As opposed to key representatives of modern aesthetics, both\nLevinson and Scruton have no problem acknowledging the existence of\nerotic art. However, they do object very strongly to the possibility\nof there being pornographic art, and it’s not hard to discern in their\nrespective objections—which rely on notions such as beauty,\ncontemplation, ideal form, aesthetic experience—the remnants and\nresidual influence of modern aesthetics. This is less obvious in\nChristy Mag Uidhir’s recent attempt to draw a line between pornography\nand art. While Scruton insists on the controversial connection between\nart and beauty, and Levinson builds his case on the idea that a work\nof art’s main purpose is to produce an aesthetic experience and draw\nattention to its own formal features, Mag Uidhir’s argument does not\nrely on any such substantial claims.  He does not even claim that art\nhas or should have a purpose. Mag Uidhir asks us only to accept\nthat if a work of art has a purpose, including perhaps the\npurpose of sexual titillation as is the case in erotic art, then that\npurpose must be manner specific.  Here’s how he arrives at his\nexclusivist position (2009: 194):  For a purpose to be manner specific, according to Mag Uidhir, is\nfor it to be essentially constituted both by an action (or state of\naffairs) and a manner, such that the purpose is to perform that action\n(or bring about that state of affairs) in that particular manner. A\npurpose is manner inspecific, on the other hand, if failure to perform\nthe action (or bring about the state of affairs) in the prescribed\nmanner does not necessarily constitute failure to satisfy the\npurpose. Mag Uidhir’s approach is markedly different from Scruton’s and\nLevinson’s. Still, regarding the central issue, he aligns himself\nsquarely with other sceptics. He, too, thinks that artists or\npornographers attempting to produce something that is both (erotic)\nart and pornography, in fact attempt the impossible.  However, recent\ncritics of Mag Uidhir have raised doubts about his second premise\n(Davies 2012; Patridge 2013), as well as the general validity of his\nargument (Maes 2012). These critics belong to a growing number of\nphilosophers who find exclusivists” arguments unconvincing and\nargue for the existence of pornographic art as a subclass of erotic\nart (Kieran 2001, van Brabandt and Prinz 2012, Fokt 2012). Besides aesthetics, there are at least two other areas of academic\nstudy where the distinction between erotic art and pornography has\nbeen at the centre of serious philosophical debate: feminist theory\nand art history. Art historians who write about erotic art are often quite anxious\nto draw a strict dividing line between “high brow” erotic\nart and “low brow” pornography. Kenneth Clark, mentioned\nearlier, famously stated to the Longford Committee Investigating\nPornography:   To my mind art exists in the realm of contemplation\n… the moment art becomes an incentive to action it loses its\ntrue character. (Longford 1972: 280) \nThis was his main objection to pornography: that it was in essence an\nincentive to sexual acts.  However, as a justification for the\nradical separation of art and pornography this will not do. For one\nthing, Clark seems to overlook the fact that there are numerous\nreligious or politically inspired masterpieces that call on people to\nchange their lives or perform certain actions\n(the Isenheim Altarpiece,\n1512–16, or Delacroix’s Liberty\nLeading the People, 1830, come to mind). This brings us to another rationale for separating erotic art and\npornography that is very popular among art historians (and is somewhat\nreminiscent of Dutton’s expressed reservations towards eroticism in\nart). Art is necessarily multi-layered, it is argued, whereas\npornography is one-dimensional; it has only one job to do and\ntherefore lacks the formal and structural intricacy, the cognitive\ncomplexity, and interpretive openness of art (see, for example, Webb\n1975: 6; Mahon 2005: 14; Wallace et al. 2007:\n15). But\nwhile the Isenheim Altarpiece and Liberty Leading the\nPeople may indeed be very complex works, there is good reason to\nbelieve that the insistence on the simplicity of pornography is itself\nthe result of an oversimplification. Let us examine this claim in more\ndetail. (1) A simple purpose? It is tempting to think of\npornography as having only one, very rudimentary purpose: sexual\narousal of the audience. But a look at very early pornographic works,\nthose that were produced in France and England between 1500 and 1800,\nshows how misleading that conception is. Almost all pornographic works\nof that era deliberately used the shock of sex to criticize religious\nand political authorities (Hunt 1996: 35). With their truth-telling\ntrope they were meant to function as a powerful antidote to the many\nforms of repression in society and often had the explicit aim to\neducate people about politics, religion, society, and of course, sex.\nIt is not a coincidence that these books were known in 18th century\nFrance as “livres philosophiques” (they were considered\njust as dangerous to society as philosophical treatises) and that the\nrise in pornography around 1740 coincided with the hey-day of the\nEnlightenment (Hunt 1996; Darnton 1995). Quite a few of the\npornographic novels of that time even carried the term\n“philosophy” in the title (think\nof Sade’s La Philosophie dans le Boudoir,\n1795) and some of them were actually written by prominent\nphilosophers who were keen to use this extremely popular genre to\ndivulge some of their ideas to the masses (think\nof Diderot’s Les Bijoux Indiscrets,\n1748). In one of the most notorious examples of the\ngenre, Thérèse Philosophe (1748),\nwritten by the philosopher Jean-Baptiste de Boyer, Marquis d’Argens, a\ngreat variety of copulations is used to communicate what is in essence\na materialist and mechanistic metaphysics. In anonymous bedrooms,\nbodies brought together by individual need and interest collide just\nlike the atoms of the natural philosophers (Jacob 1996: 160). And the\nbodies themselves are described as machines powered by the relentless\nmotion inherent in matter, by passions they cannot control:   The arrangement of our organs, the disposition of our\nfibers, a certain movement of our fluids, all determine the type of\npassions which work upon us, directing our reason and our will in the\nsmallest as well as the greatest actions we perform. (Thérèse\nPhilosophe, excerpted in Darnton 1995: 100) \nOr, as the main character herself observes:  Men and women couple like machines.  Love for them is\na tingling in the epidermis, a surge of liquids, a rush of particles\nthrough the fibers, and nothing more.  (Thérèse Philosophe,\nexcerpted in Leemans 2002: 257) (2) Formal and structural simplicity? Pornography of the\nenlightenment era also serves to tackle another misconception. It has\nbeen argued that, because the main aim of pornographers is to sexually\narouse the audience, they are forced to include as many sexually\nexplicit scenes as possible, leaving precious little room for plot\ndevelopment or formal intricacies (Steiner 1975). The pornographer\n“concocts no better than a crude excuse for a beginning; and\nonce having begun, it goes on and on and ends nowhere” (Sontag\n1994: 39). Pornography, as Adorno already noted, lacks the\nbeginning-middle-end form characteristic of literature (Sontag 1994:\n39). Yet, again, this gives us far from a waterproof criterion for\ndistinguishing erotic literature from pornography. For instance, the\nstructural complexity of the pornographic\nnovel, Histoire de Dom B… Portier des\nChartreux (1741), with its embedded stories and variety of\nnarrators, has often been noted by scholars (Frappier-Mazur 1996:\n211). The careful composition of Thérèse, where the author\nhas arranged the parts to maximize the refraction, so that wherever\nthe reader turns he seems to see throbbing sexuality, provides another\ncounterexample (Darnton 1995). (3) One-dimensional in its effect on the audience?  It\ncould be thought that sexual arousal is such a powerful, bodily state\nthat it must block out all other functions, most notably our cognitive\nfaculties. Levinson claims that this is precisely what distinguishes\nsexual arousal from sexual stimulation, which he thinks\nis not incompatible with the cognitive activity required for\naesthetic appreciation (2005: 232). Other philosophers have challenged\nthis controversial distinction (Blackburn 2006: 52; Maes 2012).\nMoreover, even if one were to accept the animal-like nature of sexual\narousal, that does not mean that it cannot be cognitively rewarding\nand artistically appropriate. As one commentator\nof Cleland’s Fanny Hill notes:   The stimulus of reading a scene in Fanny Hill\nmakes in the reader’s own nature the point made in the text. The\nreader may be moved to reconsider the merits of stoicism, revaluate\nthe powers of the mind to control the body, reread his Descartes and\nthink again of the dividing line between mind and the\nbête-machine. (Braudy 1991: 85) (4) Simple to interpret? While questions of interpretation\narise frequently in relation to works of erotic art, people rarely\nseem to have interpretive qualms where pornography is\nconcerned. Indeed, if an interpretation typically attempts to account\nfor those elements in a work whose presence is not immediately obvious\nto the target audience (Carroll 2009), there may seem no need for an\ninterpretation in the case of pornography since it is all too obvious\nwhy such films or novels include one sexually explicit scene after\nanother. Still, here too it is important not to jump to\nconclusions. There are (at least) two different kinds of\ninterpretative projects one could engage in, each with its own set of\nlead questions. “What is the work about?” is one question\none could ask. Another question is “What does the work reveal\nabout the author or the time, place, culture, society in which it was\nmade?” While the former is central to the discipline of art\ncriticism, the latter question will usually be the starting point of\ninterpretations offered by cultural historians, sociologists,\npsychoanalysts. These latter interpretations, where pornography is\nconcerned, will be everything but simple given the incredible\ncomplexity of the pornographic landscape with its huge catalogue of\ntaboos, body types, sex acts, and other things that get people’s blood\nflowing. Pornography offers us, in the words of Laura Kipnis,\n“the royal road to the cultural psyche” (2006:\n118) and as such can\nprove to be a gold mine for interpretations. The other\nquestion—What is the work about?—seems less pertinent,\nespecially in relation to the formulaic and repetitive video clips one\nfinds on porn websites. Nevertheless, there are other types of\npornography where issues about meaning and “aboutness” do\nseem highly relevant, such as the philosophical pornography mentioned\nabove and the feminist pornography that will be discussed in the next\nsection. In a short but oft-quoted essay, Gloria Steinem describes what is\nfor her “a clear and present difference”: Look at any photo or film of people making love, really making\nlove.  … there is usually sensuality and touch and warmth, an\nacceptance of bodies and nerve endings. … Now look at any\ndepiction of sex in which there is clear force, or an unequal power\nthat spells coercion. … The first is erotic: a mutually\npleasurable, sexual expression between people who have enough power to\nbe there by positive choice. … The second is pornographic: its\nmessage is violence, dominance, and conquest. (Steinem 1995:\n31) This idea that there is an important moral difference\nbetween erotic art and pornography, in so far as pornography focuses\non sex that is aggressive, emotionless, or alienated, while the focus\nof erotic art is on love, passion, and equality between partners, has\nbeen very influential (see, for example, Ellis 2006: 30; Mahon 2005:\n15; Ridington 1989: 27). However, delineating the distinctiveness of\nerotic art, as opposed to pornography, in terms of a particular\ncontent will not in and of itself establish that the latter is\nimmoral, while the former is not. As Theodore Gracyk (1987) has\nargued, the morally objectionable character of a representation can\nnever be just a matter of represented subject matter. For an artist\ncan decide to depict rape or other aggressive forms of abuse in an\nattempt to precisely warn and protest against such degradation of\nwomen or men (recall the work of Kiki Smith). That is why Helen\nLongino is careful to define pornography as   verbal or pictorial material which represents or\ndescribes sexual behavior that is degrading or abusive to one or more\nof the participants in such a way as to endorse the\ndegradation. (1980: 43, our emphasis) \nLongino is only one of the many authors who have tried to capture\nwhat is morally problematic about pornography. But the intricacies of\nthat debate will not concern us here. Our focus is on erotic art,\nrather than pornography. Still, it is worth considering some of the\nmore basic arguments, because they can be, and have been, put to use\nin discussions on the distinction between erotic art and\npornography. Perhaps the most straightforward way to argue that pornography is\nmorally objectionable (in a way that erotic art is not) is to argue\nthat it is harmful. The harm that pornography does may occur in the\nproduction phase, and take the form of coercion, brutality, violence,\nor rape. But even if no harm takes place in the making of pornography,\nand models are treated fairly and with respect, there can still be\npost-production harms. Some have argued that the pornographic\nmaterials themselves constitute harm because, as a form of\nhate speech, they silence and subordinate women (MacKinnon 1987;\nLangton 1993, 2009; Maitra 2009). Others have emphasized that exposure\nto pornographic material may cause harm (Eaton 2007). The\nlatter claim is further refined by specifying the frequency of\nexposure (isolated/cumulative), the nature of the material\n(egalitarian/inegalitarian), the kind of harm inflicted\n(physical/psychological), and whom it is mainly inflicted on\n(consumer/third party). By systematically eroticizing aspects of\ngender inequality, inegalitarian pornography is mainly thought to\ncause harm to a third party, in particular women, through the\npernicious effect it has on its consumers (Eaton 2007). “Exploitation” and “objectification” are\nterms that are used particularly often to describe what is wrong with\npornography. Martha Nussbaum (1995), for instance, has written a\nseminal essay on different forms of objectification and how they apply\nto pornography (see also Stock 2015). Artists like Nancy Spero have defined pornography as\n“stuff that exploits women’s bodies” (quoted in Cembalest\n1989: 142). It might be thought, and indeed Spero and others have\nargued, that these ethical terms may serve to demarcate (erotic) art\nfrom pornography—pornography being exploitative or objectifying\nin a way that (erotic) art is not. This way of drawing the line is significantly problematized by the\nemergence of feminist pornography. Examples are\nfilms like Skin.Like.Sun (2010,\ndir. Jennifer Lyon Bell and Murielle Scherre), Molly Kiely’s graphic\nnovel That Kind of Girl (1999),\nor Dirty Diaries, a collection of Swedish\nmovie shorts (2009).  Mutual pleasure and consent are\nabsolutely key in these pornographic works which seem to exhibit none\nof the moral flaws manifest in mainstream pornography (no\nexploitation, objectification, or eroticization of gender\ninequality). What is more, in rejecting sexual repression,\nself-oppression, and hypocrisy, these works are often said to have a\npositive, consciousness-raising force (Willis 1995; Taormino et al.\n2013; Maes 2017; Eaton 2017). But even if one were to disregard this rapidly growing subgenre of\npornography, and argue that there is something deeply wrong\nwith any type of pornography, that in itself would still not\njustify a strict divide between erotic art and pornography. For every\nplausible account of the relation between moral and artistic\nvalue—whether it is autonomism, ethicism, immoralism, or\ncontextualism—will acknowledge that works of art, including\nworks of erotic art, can be deeply morally flawed (Gaut 2007; see also\nEaton 2003 for an in depth analysis\nof Titian’s Rape of Europa,\n1562). What is more, it appears that whatever (moral) objection\none wants to bring forward against mainstream pornography, it is\nlikely to apply to some erotic art as well (Patridge 2013). First,\nharm may be inflicted when erotic art is being produced (Brown 2002\ntells the harrowing story of Cellini and the Nymph of Fontainebleau).\nSecond, some erotic art may also constitute harm. At least,\nLangton and MacKinnon’s arguments seem to carry over seamlessly to\n(certain strands of) erotic art. One of the difficult questions for\nLangton and MacKinnon—do pornographers possess the appropriate\nauthority to perform the speech acts of silencing and subordinating\nwomen?—appears even easier to answer in the affirmative in the\ncase of artists since their perceived authority is much less\ncontentious. Third, some erotic art may cause harm in the same way as\npornography, that is, by eroticizing aspects of gender inequality and\nthus shaping people’s sexual preferences in such a way that sustains\nthe current inequality between genders (Eaton 2012). Finally, a\ndetailed case is made by, respectively, Cooke 2012 and Eaton 2012 that\nneither exploitation nor objectification is unique to pornography and\nthat both are present in many works of erotic art—a presence\nthat is frequently unacknowledged precisely because critics tend to\nfocus exclusively on pornography and too often consider art to be\nabove (moral) criticism. To conclude, it does not seem possible to make a clear-cut\ndistinction between erotic art and pornography based on moral or\nfeminist grounds. Critiques of pornography have focused on features\nthat are shared by a much wider class of cultural products and by\n(some) works of erotic art in particular. This is not necessarily bad\nnews for feminists. On the contrary, feminists could embrace\nthis conclusion as it implies that their critiques are wider ranging\nthan they at first appear to be (see Kania 2012; Mikkola (ed.) 2017). Many more philosophical questions remain to be examined in relation\nto erotic art. The following will likely play an important role in\nfuture research on this topic. First, what exactly does it mean for a\nrepresentation to be voyeuristic and what, if anything, is the\ndifference between voyeurism in artistic and non-artistic\nrepresentations? The question was already raised in John Berger’s\nclassic Ways of Seeing (1972) and has recently been addressed\nin Schellekens 2012 and Eaton 2012. The latter also offers a\nphilosophical re-interpretation of the influential but strongly\npsychoanalytically informed concept of the “male gaze”\n(Mulvey 1989). To say that a work embodies the male gaze, Eaton\nsuggests, is simply to say that it prescribes that its audience\nperceives the woman represented as primarily a sex object. And:\n“To describe this “way of seeing” as\n“male” is not to claim anything about how all, or even\nmost, men respond to such pictures; rather, it is to note that this is\nthe “way of seeing” proper to someone in the masculine\nsocial role, a role which, it should be noted, is avowedly\nheterosexual” (Eaton 2012: 293). Second, what is the role of transgression in erotic art? While\nfeminist philosophers have rightly highlighted the moral dangers\ninvolved in the production and dissemination of sexual imagery, other\nphilosophers and most notably Georges Bataille (1985, 1986), have\nargued that norm-breaking, and in particular the violation of social\nor moral norms about sexual behavior, is indispensable for sexual\narousal and provides a basis for other affective states, such as\ndisgust, humor, and awe, which are often in play in sexual encounters\nand representations. (For a demystified and less radical version of\nthis argument, see Newall 2012. For a general discussion of the role\nof transgression in art, see Julius 2002). Third, how does the degree of eroticism of a work of erotic art\nrelate to its goodness as art, and how do the criteria for assessing\nerotic art differ from those appropriate to assessing art of other\nsorts? By reflecting on the appreciation and artistic status of art\nwith a non-artistic primary intended function, such as religious,\npolitical or erotic art, Davies (2012) makes a good start in answering\nthese questions. Fourth, there are interesting differences between art forms that\nare worth investigating. For instance, Adil Mustafa Ahmad notes in\nrelation to Islamic art that   practically all that is perceived as erotic\n(acceptable, sublime) when described in literature is seen as\npornographic (off-putting and vulgar) if projected in painting and\nsculpture. (Ahmad 1994: 281) \nIn Western art, too, there appear to be different degrees of\npermissibility if one compares literature with the visual arts. How\nto explain this? How to explain, furthermore, the absence, or\nnear-absence, of the genre of erotic art in what are sometimes called\nthe non-representational arts? There seems to be very little erotic\narchitecture and it is not entirely clear whether there is any\nabsolute music that qualifies as erotic. There are erotic dances, of\ncourse, but these are rarely performed within an art context or\nconsidered as art works. To illuminate the latter phenomenon it might be helpful to reflect\non issues of fictionality and imagination—a fifth important\nresearch strand. As Cain Todd (2012) argues, the awareness of\nfictionality of sexual representations ensures that one’s imaginative\nengagement implies merely imagined “desire-like” states,\nwhereas the voyeuristic appreciation of a stripper’s erotic dance\nseems to preclude this sort of engagement, and in virtue of doing so,\ninvolves real sexual desire. One might think that, characteristically,\narousal-directed imagining towards a sexual representation is de\nse in that one uses the image as a prop to imagine committing or\nwitnessing certain sexual acts and, indeed, Todd argues that the\nengagement with sexual imagery can possess certain cognitive values,\ninsofar as it involves the self in de se imaginative\nprojects. But notwithstanding the apparent plausibility of such\nclaims, this is denied by Stock (2012) who argues that enjoying\nerotica does not always involve imagining something about oneself. Sixth, if erotic art and pornography are not mutually exclusive,\nwhy is there not more art that qualifies as both? Van Brabandt and\nPrinz (2012) address this question in relation to cinema. Despite the\nmany resemblances between art films and pornographic films—jump\ncuts, long takes, “Brechtian” acting, a cinema\nvérité-like grittiness, arousal of strong emotions, an\nexploration of the extremes of human experience and of the margins of\nsociety—they argue that market forces are mainly to be blamed\nfor the lack of overlap between the two. Mari Mikkola (2013), by\ncontrast, builds on recent work in the ontology of artifacts to\nspeculate about the possibility of porno-art—a new class of\nobjects growing out of the extant categories of pornography and art,\nwithout being reducible to either one. Seventh, obscenity and censorship issues will continue to play a\nkey part in research on erotic art. They crop up in philosophical\ndiscussions of the nude (Nead 1992; Hammer 1997; Danto 2000; Scruton\n2009) and of art that challenges the classical ideal of beauty (O’Hear\n1991, Danto 1995, Mey 2007). They are also central\nto stipulative distinctions between erotic art and\npornography (Maes 2012). George P. Elliott, for instance, defines\npornography as   the representation of directly or indirectly erotic\nacts with an intrusive vividness which offends decency without\naesthetic justification. (1970: 74–75)  \nA normative definition of this kind will bring to mind certain legal\ndescriptions of obscenity such as the U.S. Supreme Court’s notorious\nMiller test, set forth in Miller v. California (1973). This\ntest proposed a three-pronged criterion for obscenity: x is\nobscene if (1) it is found appealing to the prurient interest by an\naverage person applying contemporary community standards, (2) it\ndepicts sexual conduct, specifically defined by the applicable state\nlaw, in a patently offensive way and (3) taken as a whole, it lacks\nserious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. The Miller\ntest has proved problematic in many respects, one of its most evident\nflaws being the conflation of two ideas—the pornographic and the\nobscene (Nussbaum 2004). Recent philosophical attempts to define the\nobscene have avoided this mistake—allowing for non-pornographic\nobscenities and obscene erotic art (e.g., Kieran 2002). Finally, if erotic representations and art works help to shape how\nwe see and engage with bodies, how can they be mobilised to challenge\n(or perpetuate) oppression based on race, sexual orientation, age,\nsize, and disability? Davidson (2016), Cahill (2016), Lintott &\nIrvin (2016) and Mikkola (ed., 2017) offer some useful perspectives,\nbut much more work still needs to be done on this front. In sum, it will be clear that any serious thinking about erotic art\nleads to fundamental questions about the nature of aesthetics, the\nmoral impact and status of representations, and the boundaries of art.\nAs such there can be little doubt that this topic will prove to be\nfruitful for further philosophical investigation.","contact.mail":"H.Maes@kent.ac.uk","contact.domain":"kent.ac.uk"}]
