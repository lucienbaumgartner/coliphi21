Do names have meanings, or do\nthey simply refer to particular things without that reference being\nmediated by a meaning?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cambridge Grammar of English distinguishes the syntactic category\nof proper name from that of proper\nnoun (Payne & Huddleston 2002: 516). A\nproper noun is a word-level unit of the category noun, while\na proper name is a type of noun phrase. So, for example, the\nproper name “Alice Walker” consists of two proper\nnouns: “Alice” and “Walker”. A proper\nname (the noun phrase) may also—and often\ndoes—consist of a single proper noun, just as a verb phrase may\nconsist of a lone verb. Hence, the sentence “Alice sleeps”\nis comprised of a noun phrase/proper name and a verb phrase; the noun\nphrase contains a single proper noun, and the verb phrase consists of\na lone verb. Its analysis into syntactic constituents would look like\nthis:  \nProper names may contain other parts of speech, too: “Brooklyn\nBridge” places the common noun “Bridge” alongside\nthe proper noun “Brooklyn”. “The Raritan\nRiver” includes the determiner “the”. “The\nBronx” combines a determiner and a proper noun. Finally,\n“the Golden Gate Bridge” is a proper name with no proper\nnouns in it at all. \nProper names occur in different formats depending on the sort of thing\nnamed (Carroll 1985). For instance, official names of persons in most\nWestern cultures consist of (at least) first and last names,\nthemselves proper nouns. Names of bridges have an optional definite\narticle and often include the common noun “bridge”. We\nhave bridge names that embed other proper names like “The George\nWashington Bridge”. We can even imagine structurally ambiguous\nnames, such as “the New New York Public Library”. \nTo accommodate the full range of proper names, we need one more\nsyntactic category. Following the Cambridge English Grammar once again\nfor convenience, a noun phrase consists of an optional determiner\nfollowed by a nominal phrase. Thus in the noun\nphrase “the man who was Thursday”, the nominal phrase\nconstituent is “man who was Thursday”. If we assume a\nsimilar construction for proper names, then “the Raritan\nRiver” has a constituent “Raritan River” (itself\nmade up of the proper noun “Raritan” and the common noun\n“River”). We will call the constituent that is the\ncomplement of the (optional) determiner in a proper name a proper\nnominal. Thus the full analysis of the proper\nname “Alice” looks like this:  \nNames are standardly categorized as definite\nnoun phrases (Mulkern 1996; Abbott 2002). They can occur with markers of definiteness, such as\nthe definite article “the” in English (though in some\nlanguages, such as Samoan, proper names obligatorily occur with a\nspecial proprial article, distinguished from\nthe ordinary definite article). Since definite descriptions also\nbelong under the general head of definite noun phrases (along with\npronouns and demonstratives), this evidence is used to support views\non which names are a type of definite description (Sloat 1969; Larson\n& Segal 1995: 354–355; Elbourne 2005), but is consistent\nwith names forming their own species of definite. \nProper nominals (proper names without their determiner) can modify\nother nouns, as in “a Bronx resident”. They can also occur\nas the restrictor of determiners other than “the”, as in\n“every University of California, from Berkeley to Santa\nCruz”. Some (Sloat 1969; Burge 1973) see the predicate meanings\nof proper nominals as primary, and attempt to generate the meaning of\nthe more common argumental occurrences of proper names from them.\nHowever, it is also reasonable to regard predicative proper nominals\nas on a par with “coerced” expressions such as the verb\n“to google” (Leckie 2013; Schoubye 2017). \nIs there just one proper name “Alice” or are there many\nhomonyms, one for each person or thing so named? It is tempting to\ninfer the uniqueness of the name, on syntactic grounds, from the\nuniqueness of the proper noun. Arguably the same noun recurs in the\ndifferent names “Alice Waters” and “Alice\nWalker”, as well as in the phrase “two famous\nAlices” (though see Sainsbury 2015 and Gray 2015 on the latter).\nAnd if the name “Alice” is a complex expression built up\nfrom a unique noun, then presumably there should be only one such\nexpression built up in that particular way. \nOn the other hand, the name “Alice” can be used to refer\nto many different people. If the same syntactic item is responsible in\neach case, this profligacy must be explained. Supposing the name is\nmeaningful (the topic of the next section), it is either (massively)\nambiguous, or else has the sort of meaning that constrains, without\ndetermining, the reference of a specific utterance, or perhaps instead\na general meaning that identifies a different referent when uttered in\ndifferent contexts (in the manner of indexicals like\n“here” and “now”). \nIf, on the other hand, there are many homonyms, then each may be\nallocated its own semantic convention, independently determining its\nparticular referent (see Kripke 1980: 7–8; Kaplan 1990). It is\nreasonable to say, then, that the uniquely denoting name is a\ntechnical innovation meeting a specific theoretical need in semantics.\nAlternative terminology employed with the same goal in mind, but a\ngreater reluctance to embrace genuine homonymy, includes\n“use” (Strawson 1950), “name-using practice”\n(Evans 1982), “naming convention” (Matushansky 2008: 592;\nRecanati 1997), and even “discourse entity” (Cumming\n2014). \nFor the exposition to come, we will not presume the issue settled, and\nwill speak, at different times, of the many homonymous specific\nnames “Alice”, as well as the\nunique generic name “Alice”. \nAs well as having a range of entities to which it applies, the common\nnoun “bachelor” has a meaning; it means man who has\nnever been married. What about names? “Socrates”\ncertainly applies to things. It applies, most obviously, to the\nfounder of Western philosophy. Understood as a generic name (see\n Section 1),\n “Socrates” applies to several individuals: to a first\napproximation, all those who are called “Socrates”. But\ndoes “Socrates” also possess a meaning? \nSome names have meanings in a sense. I have heard “Merlot”\nused to summon a child, and once knew of a married couple whose\nrespective names were “Sunshine” and\n“Moonlight”. These names, we would say, have meanings.\n“Moonlight”, for instance, means light from the\nMoon. Something similar goes on when we say that\n“Theodore” means gift of god, or interpret a\nMohawk name as a verb phrase. But this sense of meaning turns out not\nto be the one we are after. \nConsider that for “bachelor” the meaning—man who\nhas never been married—is also what determines the\nnoun’s range of application. When the noun\n“bachelor” applies to someone, it’s because they are\na man who has never been married. And when it fails to apply to\nsomeone, it’s because they are not. By contrast, the kind of\nmeaning just canvassed for the names “Merlot” or\n“Moonlight” places no direct constraint on what they apply\nto. One may be named “Merlot”, and so fall within the\nname’s range of application, no matter what relationship one\nbears to the wine grape variety, Merlot (Mill 1843: 34).\nMoreover, one’s particular relationship to the grape is not the\nreason the name applies. \nIn this long tail of the article on semantics, we will confine\nourselves to the question of whether names have a meaning in the sense\nin which “bachelor” does. Do they have a meaning that\ndetermines, or at least restricts, their extension\n(i.e., either range of application or\nreference)? As we will see, even pursuing this reduced target,\nphilosophers have had to consider a series of foundational questions\nabout language and meaning. It is not off-limits to ask a different\nquestion about names, or to think about their meaning in some other\nway, but this question will open a path through the important topics\nin the semantics of names, and indeed the philosophy of language. \nLet’s begin with the generic name “Alice”. Consider\nthe range of individuals to which it applies. Unlike the range of\n“bachelor”, this set is not united under a brief\ndefinition, but consists of all the various people (including Alice\nCooper), and perhaps things, referred to by (occurrences of) the name\n“Alice”. A natural view, then, is that the individual\nreferential relationships are what’s basic here, and any\ngeneralization concerning a generic name’s range of application\nis based on them, rather than the other way around. According to this\nview, there is no general meaning of the name, responsible for\ndetermining to whom it correctly applies. While one could articulate a\n(complex) condition that correctly sorts Alices from non-Alices on\nsome basis other than those referential relationships (for instance, a\ndisjunction consisting of each Alice’s unique time and place of\nbirth), it is clear that any such condition would be a superstructure\nbuilt atop of those relationships, rather than being, with any\nplausibility, their originating source. \nThe only concise way of delimiting the range of generic\n“Alice” is with a metalinguistic feature, such as\nbeing named “Alice”. And indeed some have\ndefended a metalinguistic account of the\nmeaning of generic names (see\n Section 2.10\n below). The challenge for the account is to distinguish the relevant\nfeature from that of being in the extension of\n“Alice”, which clearly cannot determine the extension\nin the robust sense required of a meaning (Kripke 1980: 68; Geurts\n1997: 326ff; Bach 2002: 83; Gray 2014). \nNext consider the specific name “Socrates”. It refers to a\ncertain Athenian, and, in contrast to the generic case, this (unitary)\nextension may be delimited concisely without appeal to its onomastic\nfeatures. Moreover, just like “bachelor”,\n“Socrates” appears in (some) dictionaries along with an\nexplanation supplying just this sort of non-linguistic identifying\ninformation. The following is from Lexico (see the link in Other\nInternet Resources): \n(469–399 BC), Greek philosopher. As represented in the writings\nof his disciple Plato, he engaged in dialogue with others in an\nattempt to define ethical concepts by exposing and dispelling error\n(the Socratic method). Charged with introducing strange gods and\ncorrupting the young, Socrates was sentenced to death and died by\ndrinking hemlock. \nOf course, the majority of specific names do not appear in any\ndictionary. Moreover, it should not be thought that dictionary\n“definitions” always purport to give the meaning of the\nword they appear under (one entry for “Socrates” on\nWiktionary just says “A male given name of mostly historical\nuse”). But suppose we have a condition satisfied by, and only\nby, the referent of “Socrates”; one which is, moreover,\nlisted below the name in certain dictionaries. For the sake of\nargument, suppose it is the teacher of Plato and Xenophon.\nWould it follow that “Socrates” meant the teacher of\nPlato and Xenophon? \nNot necessarily. First note that, prima facie,\n“Socrates” simply does not mean the teacher of Plato\nand Xenophon. While we would agree that Socrates was the\nteacher of Plato and Xenophon, we would not be inclined to say that\nthis is what the word “Socrates” means. By\ncontrast, we are happy to say that “bachelor” means\nman who has never been married. \nSimilarly, though a dictionary might offer a definition of\n“cat” as domestic animal with retractile claws,\nwe would not be inclined to say that “cat” meant\ndomestic animal with retractile claws, though we would admit\nthat cats were such animals. Even if cats are the only\ndomestic animals in existence having retractile claws, it does not\nseem correct to say that this is the meaning of “cat”. The\nmeaning of a word is more than just an accurate description of the\ncontents of its extension. \nIn the first place, a condition that selects the correct range for a\nword is not necessarily the condition that determines that the word\nhas that range. Suppose all and only ascetics have matted hair. Still,\n“ascetic” doesn’t mean person with matted\nhair, because having matted hair, though it may be a distinction\nof ascetics, is not what makes one an ascetic. But even supposing our\ncondition is the one in virtue of which “Socrates” applies\nto the relevant Athenian, it still doesn’t follow that it is the\nmeaning of “Socrates”. It may yet be that\n“Socrates” doesn’t have a meaning (compare Kripke\n1980: 32–33). Though we take the meaning of a word to determine\nits range of application, we do not assume the converse, that whatever\ndetermines the range of application of a word must be its meaning. We\nallow that names might work differently from “bachelor”.\nTheir extension might be determined by something other than a meaning;\nfor instance, their previous use\n (Section 2.7). \nTo put it another way, the question as to whether a name has a meaning\nis not trivial. The name “Socrates” refers to a particular\nAthenian, and, unless reference is metaphysically basic, there must be\nsome feature of the world in virtue of which it does (cf. Kripke 1980:\n88, fn.38). However, this feature may or may not comprise the meaning\nof the specific name “Socrates”. It is really a further\nquestion whether this feature is semantic or meta-semantic, whether it\nis part of the meaning, or whether it establishes the name’s\nreference without belonging to its meaning. The theory of (nominal)\nreference (see the entry) should be distinguished from\nthe—intertwined—theory of the semantics of names (Dickie\n2011). \nAnother issue we must disentangle from the semantics of names is that\nof their cognitive significance and allied\nbehavior in opaque contexts, including especially attitude reports\n(see the entry on Propositional Attitude Reports). \nNames that corefer do not always communicate the same information. For\ninstance, to one who is ignorant of the fact that the names\n“Hesperus” (i.e., the Evening Star) and\n“Phosphorus” (i.e., the Morning Star) both refer to the\nplanet Venus, the sentence “Hesperus is a planet” and the\nsentence “Phosphorus is a planet” transmit different\ninformation, producing different cognitive states and resultant action\n(Frege 1892). One who mishears an utterance of one of these sentences,\nmistaking it for the other, has misunderstood the speaker, despite\narriving at an interpretation that is extensionally correct (Loar\n1976). \nMoreover, coreferring names may be used with distinguishing import\neven by those in the know. When (in Wharton’s novel) Miranda\nfalls upon the Abbot’s mercy, and admits she has been playing\nthe part of a man to sidestep an ecclesiastical restriction on female\nperformers, he mercifully lifts the ban: \n“My only condition,” he added with a truly paternal smile,\n“is that, after the Signorina Miranda’s performance at the\ntheatre her twin brother the Signor Mirandolo shall return every\nevening to the monastery.” (Wharton, The Valley of\nDecision) \nThe Abbot’s condition is not met unless Miranda returns to the\nmonastery each night in male guise (compare Saul 2007). \nRelatedly, coreferring names cannot always be substituted salva\nveritate in the context of a propositional attitude report (Frege\n1892). If Daphnis doesn’t know that Hesperus is Phosphorus, then\nit could be true that \nWhile being false that \nThese observations are connected with the main question of this\nsection—do names have meanings? For names with the same\nreference could yet differ in meaning, and this might explain their\ndiffering cognitive significance. In particular, if a name’s\nmeaning is (part of) what it contributes to the truth condition of an\nutterance, then a difference in meaning, in spite of an equivalence in\nreference, could lead to a different truth-value for the sentence. \nNevertheless, we will not consider this source of evidence for nominal\nmeaning further in the article. In the first place, the phenomena just\nrecounted are general to all kinds of referring expression (and\nperhaps other sorts of expression too), rather than being particular\nto names, and so their discussion properly belongs under a more\ngeneral head. Second, in cases where we are less uncertain that\nmeaning exists, it does not seem to correspond to cognitive\nsignificance. For example, given the right scenario,\n“bachelor” and the phrase documenting its\nmeaning—“man who has not been married”—would\nalso fail to substitute salva veritate in an attitude report.\nFinally, the debate over cognitive significance devolves into a\nstalemate, as any detailed explanation of the phenomena that relies on\nnames having meanings can be approximated by one that relies instead\non information which, while associated with a name, is not considered\nits meaning (Soames 2002). \nI will substantiate the last point at length, by considering a\nparticular account of the cognitive significance of names. The account\nassimilates cognitive significance to the identifying\ninformation associated with a specific name in an agent’s\nmind (Strawson 1974: 43ff). To illustrate this, suppose I know of two\nindividuals bearing the name “Zera Yacob”. Most likely, I\nassociate a different sobriquet, or description, with each specific\nversion of the name, as a way of maintaining the distinction in my\nmind. Moreover, whenever I speak or hear the name “Zera\nYacob”, I implicitly associate the utterance with one of those\ndescriptions; either it is the seventeenth century philosopher or the\nfifteenth century Emperor of Ethiopia who is being named in this\ninstance. Plausibly, I cannot felicitously utter “Zera\nYacob” without selecting either the prince or the philosopher as\nmy intended referent, and I can’t fully interpret\nanother’s utterance of the name without forming a parallel\ndetermination. \nIf each specific name is annexed to some identifying\ninformation—enough to single out its bearer at least in the mind\nof the agent—then this could explain the different cognitive\nsignificances of coreferring names. But does the identifying sobriquet\nalso represent the meaning of the name? There are several reasons to\ndoubt that it does. First, different agents could well associate\ndifferent identifying information with the same specific name (Frege\n1892), which would seem to conflict with the natural assumption that a\nname like “Socrates” has a single meaning throughout a\ncommunity. Different responses are available here. We might say that\nthe meaning of a name is relative to the idiolect of the individual,\nrather than the dialect of the group. Another option would be to claim\nthat the meaning of a name in a public language is aggregated in some\nway from the identifying information associated with it by each member\nof the relevant public (Strawson 1959: 191–192). Note that, on\nthe latter sort of account, it would be possible for a user (or even\nevery user) of the name to only have a partial grip on its (aggregate)\nmeaning (see\n Section 2.3). \nSecond, information that is sufficient for identificational purposes\n(internally distinguishing one bearer of a name from another) may yet\nbe inadequate to determine the extension of a name (Strawson 1959:\n20–21). For instance, “the Roman author” is enough\nto distinguish Marcus Tullius Cicero from Cicero, Illinois (the two\nCiceros some agent happens to know about). But it is not sufficient to\nselect a unique Cicero in the world (Kripke 1980: 81; Donnellan 1970:\n343). There is, for instance, Cicero’s younger brother, Quintus\nTullius Cicero, also an author of several works. \nA description can also function as identifying though it is false of\nthe proper referent of the specific name. For instance, many would\nhave inaccurately identified Christopher Columbus as the first\nEuropean to visit the Americas (Searle 1958: 168; Strawson 1964: 102;\nDonnellan 1970: 341; Kripke 1980: 83–84). \nIf the feature used for identificational purposes is false of the\nreferent of the name, then by our criterion it cannot serve as the\nmeaning of the name. If it is true, but insufficient to discriminate\nthe referent, then the situation is different. It is possible to claim\nthat the identifying feature is the meaning of the name, while\nadmitting that nominal meaning merely constrains, without fully\ndetermining, nominal reference. Names would then be akin to certain\npronouns (arguably, the meaning of “she” merely limits its\npossible referents in certain respects). \nThus, it is possible to find a place in one’s theory for\nidentifying descriptions, and even use them to explain cognitive\nsignificance, while still denying that they correspond to the meanings\nof names. Strawson himself, who developed the account of\nidentification on display, and who thought that a name’s\nreference was determined by its associated identifying description\n(1959: 181–182), did not conceive of that description as\nexpressing the name’s meaning (1950: 340). \nMore generally, suppose we call whatever theoretical posit captures\nthe cognitive significance of names, sense,\nfollowing Frege. The crucial point is that we need not conflate the\nlinguistic meaning of a name with its sense (Kripke 1980: 59; Burge\n1977). This is so even if we take a name to contribute its sense to\nthe truth condition of an attitude report, as Frege also suggested.\nRemember, we understand meaning as something that (if present)\ndetermines or constrains the extension of a word. We have refrained\nfrom identifying meaning with a word’s contribution to the truth\ncondition of a declarative sentence (what is usually called its semantic\nvalue). If we had, then it would follow,\nfrom the fact that names do contribute to truth conditions, that names\nhave meanings; and we had wanted to frame the issue of a name’s\nmeaning so that it didn’t have a trivial answer. Instead, we\nhave left open whether a name’s contribution—sense or\nreferent—is determined by its meaning, or else, in the absence\nof such a meaning, by extra-semantic factors, such as use. \nThere are propositions we can only confirm or justify by observation\nand experiment. There are, for example, various ways to establish that\nthe Earth is round, an especially conclusive one being\ncircumnavigation. There are other propositions that no observation can\nconfirm, nor, indeed, disconfirm; for instance, the proposition that\nbachelors are unmarried. Since “bachelor” is defined as\nman who has never been married, we derive this proposition\nprior to any consultation of the external world. It is a\npriori. \nBy similar reasoning, if “Socrates” meant the teacher\nof Plato and Xenophon, it would be a priori that\nSocrates taught Plato (Kripke 1980: 65). However, unlike the\nproposition that bachelors are unmarried, this claim does not seem to\nbe a priori. Intuitively speaking, the widely held belief\nthat Socrates taught Plato could turn out to be false. Perhaps one day\ndocuments will come to light establishing that the person who served\nas a model for the character of Socrates in Plato’s dialogues\n(and other similar traditions) lived out his life prior to\nPlato’s birth. Such evidence would appear to refute the\ntradition according to which Plato was Socrates’ pupil. \nBy contrast, no observation could unseat the belief that bachelors are\nunmarried. Even irrefutable evidence that each individual we thought a\nbachelor had in fact been married would not convince us that bachelors\nwere, after all, married men. We would conclude instead that those men\nweren’t bachelors (compare Putnam 1962 and Unger 1983 on\n“cat”). \nNow an a priori proposition is not automatically known. If\none is ignorant of the meaning of the relevant terms, then one\npresumably won’t know the a priori proposition that\nfollows from the meaning. Someone might be unaware, for example, that\nall language is either verse or prose, or that all planets have\nsufficient mass to assume hydrostatic equilibrium; yet both\npropositions follow from the definitions of the relevant words\n(“prose” is defined as language without the metrical\nstructure of verse; and the official definition of\n“planet” includes a clause requiring hydrostatic\nequilibrium). \nThe fact that some users of “Socrates” don’t realize\nthat Socrates taught Plato does not immediately show that the\nproposition is a posteriori. It could be that they are\nignorant of the meaning of “Socrates”, and if they had\nknown it, they would also have known (a priori) that Socrates\ntaught Plato. The same goes for the intuition that it could turn\nout that Socrates did not teach Plato. This intuition could\nsimilarly originate in obscuring ignorance of meaning. It should be\nkept in mind that the argument we are considering in this section\n(often termed the epistemic argument) takes\nfor granted that if “Socrates” had a meaning, we would\nknow what it was, and be in a position to draw a priori\nconclusions from it. \nWith this one caveat, the epistemic argument is an effective challenge\nto many accounts that provide names with a substantial meaning. Often\nwhat would follow from the proposed meaning is something that,\naccording to our intuition, could turn out to be false. An ingenious\nresponse to the argument is to identify the meaning of a name with\n(roughly speaking) whatever claims about its extension could not turn\nout to be false, according to ordinary speakers’ intuitions\n(Chalmers & Jackson 2001). Such an account of meaning (call it\napriorist) is of course immune to the\nepistemic argument. \nWhat sorts of claims are we talking about here? Not the claim that\nSocrates taught Plato: this, intuitively, could turn out to be false.\nBut what about the claim that it could turn out false that\nSocrates taught Plato. The justification for this claim was not\nobservational evidence, but an intuition about a hypothetical\nscenario, and what we would say about Socrates in that scenario. We\nfelt that if the true source of Plato’s character had died\nbefore Plato was born, then it would follow that Socrates did not\nteach Plato. But whence this judgment? Perhaps it stems from the\nconviction that, roughly, “Socrates” will refer to whoever\nturns out to be the actual source of the eponymous character in\nPlato’s dialogues (and other similar traditions). This is not\nquite a priori either. As a claim, it stands or falls on our\nempirical knowledge of the relevant traditions. Still, one imagines\nthe claim could be winnowed down further, until, as it were, all the\na posteriori chaff is removed. The remaining polished kernel\ncould then serve as the apriorist meaning of\n“Socrates”. \nIt would be interesting to see this exercise carried out in full, but\nwhat would it show? Not that a certain core of knowledge must\nconstitute the meaning of “Socrates”. There is always the\npossibility that “Socrates” has no meaning. Even if the\naccount of what determines the reference of a name has an a\npriori core, we may yet conclude that such reference is\ndetermined extra-semantically. Perhaps the a priori core is\nsimply an (a priori) theory of reference in general, applied\nto the special case of “Socrates”. \nFurthermore, the apriorist account, like the epistemic argument that\nled us to it, relies on the assumption that meanings, and their a\npriori consequences, are known to speakers, who then lean on this\nknowledge in forming intuitive judgments about what could turn out to\nbe true of Socrates—or bachelors. But consider the person who\nfinds it intuitive that a planet might not have achieved hydrostatic\nequilibrium? We would like to say that they don’t fully\nunderstand what “planet” means, given that this is one of\nthe conditions in the 2006 definition arrived at by the International\nAstronomical Union (see Other Internet Resources). However,\non the apriorist account, we are forced to say instead that the\nproposition that all planets have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium\ndoes not follow from the meaning of “planet”, as it does\nnot belong to the a priori core (as proven by the one speaker\nwho doesn’t find it intuitive). Indeed, the a priori\ncore, whatever it is, only supports the judgment that all planets have\nachieved hydrostatic equilibrium in conjunction with the a\nposteriori knowledge that achieving hydrostatic equilibrium was a\nclause in the definition of “planet” stipulated by an\nauthority. \nThe concern is that many uncontroversial examples of word meaning are\nnot known to some speakers (and for any example, including\n“bachelor”, we could easily contrive a case in which it\nwas not known to someone), and hence must be excluded by the\napriorist. Even if one is convinced that whatever (directly)\ndetermines the extension of a word constitutes its meaning, there is\nstill no guarantee that a particular (or general) theory of extension\ndetermination can be found, however implicit, in native speaker\nintuitions. Or, supposing it can be, that the process of deriving it\nfrom those intuitions is one of a priori demonstrative\ninference. Like other aspects of linguistic theory, the road from\nnative speaker judgments to theory is presumably the ampliative method\nof science. \nThe fact that “bachelor” means man who has never been\nmarried makes it the case that that bachelors are\nnecessarily unmarried. A married bachelor is an\nimpossibility, a contradiction in terms. A man who in fact lived his\nlife a bachelor could have (instead) married, but if he had, his\nbachelor status would have immediately ceased. But this is a possible\nscenario in which one who, actually a bachelor, got married instead,\nrather than a scenario containing a married bachelor. \nThis is a separate topic from that of the previous section, since\nnecessity and the a priori can come apart. Consider the claim\nthat the nucleus of an atom of gold contains 79 protons. This claim is\nnot a priori. It is the fruit of an empirical inquiry into\nthe nature of gold, and could certainly not have been deduced from the\nmeaning of “gold”. It is, however, a necessary truth\n(Kripke 1980: 123–125). The nature of gold is, in this respect,\nimmutable. If you added or subtracted protons from the nucleus, you\nwould no longer have an atom of gold, but some other element\ninstead. \nConsider once more the view that “Socrates” means the\nteacher of Plato and Xenophon. Does it similarly predict a\nnecessary relation between being Socrates and being the teacher of\nPlato and Xenophon? Is it committed to the impossibility of a Socrates\nwho never taught? If so, the view would seem to be in trouble. For it\nappears a contingent fact—one that could have been\notherwise—that Socrates taught Plato (Searle 1958: 172; Kripke\n1980: 74). Socrates could, after all, have died in infancy; or else\nhave lived, but declined to take on his most famous pupil. \nNote that “Socrates” is a referring expression, while\n“bachelor” is a nominal predicate. In carrying over the\nanalogy from “bachelor”, we had to convert\n“Socrates” into a predicate (“being\nSocrates”). This was because the necessities we recorded for\n“bachelor” involved the co-instantiation of\nproperties—one can’t be a bachelor without\nbeing unmarried (compare Dummett 1973: 131). But it may be\nthat referring expressions relate to their meanings in a manner\ndifferent to predicates—one that implies no necessary\nco-instantiation of properties. Indeed, we will find that this is the\ncase, for at least one sort of referring expression, in\n Section 2.5. \nA different test using modal sentences relies on the assumption that\nsynonymous expressions should be substitutable salva veritate\nin modal contexts. To accede to this, we need not think that the\nmeaning of an expression corresponds to its truth-conditional\ncontribution; only that, in identical linguistic contexts, synonymous\nexpressions will make (or are likely to make) the same contribution.\n(Keep in mind that synonymous expressions are certainly not\nsubstitutable salva veritate in all contexts. Substituting\n“man who has never been married” for\n“bachelor” might change the truth-value of an attitude\nreport if the attitude holder is ignorant of the meaning of\n“bachelor”.) \nAs it turns out, “Socrates” and “the teacher of\nPlato and Xenophon” cannot be substituted salva\nveritate in modal contexts (compare Kripke 1980:\n40–42): \nIf we consider that Plato and Xenophon could have been raised by\nwolves, (3) sounds true, while (4) remains false. Thus, if we agree\nthat synonyms should substitute in this context,\n“Socrates” cannot mean the teacher of Plato and\nXenophon. \nHowever, observe that (3) also has a (false) reading on which it says\nroughly the same thing as (4). This suggests that “the teacher\nof Plato and Xenophon” might be ambiguous and synonymous with\n“Socrates” on only one of its two readings. (A competing\nexplanation is that “Socrates” is lexically univocal, but\ngives rise to a structural ambiguity, as it is analyzed as a\nscope-taking expression—see Russell 1905; Neale 1990. Note,\nhowever, that this approach doesn’t lend itself as well to the\ndefense of our hypothesis. Such a defense needs to claim that names,\nperhaps similarly to the quantifier “each”, gravitate\ntowards the widest possible scope in the sentence—see Dummett\n1981: Ch.9; Soames 1998; and Sosa 2001 for further discussion of this proposal.) \nFollowing Rothschild (2007) and Nichols (in unpublished work; see\n other internet resources),\n we could say that while the name “Socrates” refers to an\nindividual, the definite description “the teacher of Plato and\nXenophon” can refer either to that same individual, or else to a\nparticular role—namely, that of teacher to Plato and Xenophon.\nWhen understood in the second way, (3) means something like “The\nrole of teacher to Plato and Xenophon might have been filled by a\nnon-human”. Since we clearly can use definite descriptions to\nrefer to roles, as in “The president is the highest office in\nthe country”, the basic premise is not far-fetched. \nAn allowance in definite descriptions which lets them refer\nadditionally to roles would explain their different behavior in modal\nsentences without threatening the idea that a name could be synonymous\nwith a definite description on its non-role reading. Still, the\nforegoing reflections offer no further help in interpreting the claim\nthat “Socrates” means the teacher of Plato and\nXenophon. The claim can’t simply be that\n“Socrates” and “the teacher of Plato and\nXenophon” corefer. Even one who denies a meaning to\n“Socrates” admits this. But if there are no detectable\nmodal consequences of a name’s having some meaning, in what\nother substantial sense should this possession be understood? \nThe Oxford English Dictionary’s entry for the first person\npronoun “I” says: “Used by the speaker or writer\nreferring to himself or herself.” This is plausibly a linguistic\nrule: it is correct English to use “I” this way. The\ndefinition also determines the reference of (a particular utterance\nof) “I”. It seems reasonable, then, to think of this rule\nas giving the meaning of “I” (Kaplan 1989a: 520–521;\nReichenbach 1947, 284). \nThis is handy: we now have an example of the form the meaning of a\nreferring expression can take. The first benefit is that we can\nconfirm that this kind of meaning doesn’t generate necessities,\nthe way the meaning of “bachelor” did. Suppose\n“I” means the speaker in the context (Kaplan\n1989a: 495). Well, it is possible to be me without being the speaker\nin the context. Though I am speaking now, I might have remained silent\n(Kaplan 1989a: 509). \nIt is evident, too, that the meaning of “I” cannot perform\nthe duties of an interpersonal Fregean sense (discussed in\n Section 2.2).\n The rule determining the reference of an utterance of “I”\n(what Kaplan calls its character) is not the\nsame as the contribution such an utterance makes to the communicated\ncontent (the cognitive significance of the utterance) on a particular\noccasion of use. Indeed, whereas “I” has a fixed\ncharacter, it contributes different senses when uttered by different\npeople (see Frege 1918–1919 [1956: 296]). \nThe rule is not irrelevant to the cognitive significance of an\nutterance of the term, of course; and may be considered the mode by\nwhich its interpersonal content is presented (Kaplan 1989a: 530).\nMoreover, the meaning of “I” supports a priori\ninferences of a particular sort (Kaplan 1989a: 508–509). For\ninstance, no empirical investigation is required to divine that an\nutterance of “I” refers to the one uttering it. Hence,\n“I am the one uttering this sentence” is a\npriori. \nThe meaning of “I” provides a model for the meaning of\nnames, but is there a candidate meaning for a name that fits this\nmodel? “I” does not refer to the same person every time it\nis used, so we might reasonably suppose that it provides a better\nmodel for a generic name—also used for different\npeople—than a specific one. The rough thinking being that if a\nname is only ever used to refer to one thing (as a specific name is),\nthere is no real need for a general rule of use. \nWhat would a rule of use for a generic name look like? If\n“I” constrains reference to the speaker in the context,\nthen generic “Alice”, in most situations (unless the\nreferent is a protected witness, for example), constrains reference to\npersons called “Alice”. A semantic rule of use for generic\n“Alice” would thus amount to a metalinguistic account of\nits meaning. More will be said motivating and criticizing such a\nstance in the dedicated\n section (2.10)\n to come, but I will preview a major criticism of the view that names\nhave a metalinguistic rule of use below. \nThe rule governing the use of a generic name like “Alice”\nhas been spelled out by various theorists in similar ways (Burks 1951;\nLerner & Zimmermann 1984, 1991; Haas-Spohn 1995; Recanati 1997;\nPelczar & Rainsbury 1998). On each occasion of use, a referent for\nthe name will be more-or-less available, or obligatory, depending on\nthe familiarity and salience of a convention that tags that referent\nwith that generic name. So a minimal rule of use for\n“Alice” would require each utterance to refer to one to\nwhom that (generic) name has been conventionally attached. A stronger\nversion would have it that an utterance of “Alice”\nobligatorily refers to the most salient individual of this sort. \nAs Kaplan (1989a: 562) points out, there is a competing account of the\nvariable reference of names that does not treat them as generic\nexpressions with a metalinguistic meaning (rule of use). On that\naccount, the variation in reference is due to either ambiguity or\nhomonymy (i.e., there are many different “specific” names\nwith the same form), and what passes for a rule of use on the\nmetalinguistic theory is not properly ascribed to the meaning of names\nat all, but is rather a more generally applicable procedure of\ndisambiguation (see also Evans 1973, as well as Evans 1982, where\nname-using practices, rather than specific names, are settled on in\nthe process of disambiguation). \nTo illustrate the difference, recall that it is a convention of\nEnglish that a speaker uses “I” to refer to themselves.\nThat convention is available to us, roughly speaking, whenever we are\nconversing with fellow English speakers, and we must always\ndisambiguate an uttered token of “I” (distinguishing it,\nsay, from homophone “eye”) prior to applying this\nconvention to determine the token’s referent. The availability\nof the “I” convention in a conversation, and the\ndisambiguation of an individual token of “I”, while\ncrucial to communication, are matters that come before applying its\nrule of use, and so are distinct from the matters addressed in that\nrule. \nWe might go so far as to say that the sort of things a metalinguistic\nrule of use ranges over—conventions and the like—are just\nnot suitable targets for linguistic meanings (compare Pelczar &\nRainsbury 1998: 297–298). However, a rule of use just like the\none advanced for generic “Alice” is very plausible for\ncertain other expressions. For instance, “the tall Alice”\nor even just “the Alice” (see Jeshion 2017 for\nunexceptionable examples of the latter) is a context-sensitive phrase\nused to refer to the most salient individual satisfying a\nmetalinguistic predicate (either being tall and being called\n“Alice”, or just being called “Alice”). For\nsuch examples, disambiguation between a number of different senses (of\neither “the Alice” or “the tall Alice”) is not\na plausible account. \nIt is obvious in hindsight that natural language, in its versatility,\nwould not disbar metalinguistic rules of use. Still, the point remains\nthat ceteris paribus we should prefer pre-semantic\ndisambiguation as an explanation, since it is required anyway, to\nadding complicated metalinguistic rules of use alongside it. \nSuppose we are convinced, perhaps by arguments already given, that\nthe teacher of Plato and Xenophon is not, by itself, a\nsatisfactory specification of the meaning of “Socrates”.\nWe might beat an orderly retreat, maintaining that it is still part of\nthat meaning. Instead of being specifiable in a single succinct\ncondition, the meaning of “Socrates” is constructed from a\ncluster of conditions, which includes, but is not exhausted\nby, the teacher of Plato and the teacher of\nXenophon. \nStrawson, though he did not think names were meaningful, proposed that\nthe referent of a specific name was determined by the collection of\nidentifying descriptions associated with the name in the\ncommunity: \nSuppose we take a group of speakers who use, or think they use, the\nname, “Socrates”, with the same reference. Suppose we then\nask each member of the group to write down what he considers to be the\nsalient facts about Socrates, and then form from these lists of facts\na composite description incorporating the most frequently mentioned\nfacts. Now it would be too much to say that the success of\nterm-introduction within the group by means of the name requires that\nthere should exist just one person of whom all the propositions in the\ncomposite description are true. But it would not be too much to say\nthat it requires that there should exist one and only one person of\nwhom some reasonable proportion of these propositions is true. If, for\nexample, it should be found that there was just one person of whom\nhalf the propositions were jointly true, and just one person, a\ndifferent one, of whom the other half of the propositions were jointly\ntrue, then, unless some indication were given of which Socrates was\nmeant, it would become impossible to give a straightforward answer to\nthe question, whether any particular “proposition about\nSocrates” was true or false. It is true, perhaps, of\nSocrates\\(_1\\), and not of Socrates\\(_2\\). It is neither true nor\nfalse of Socrates simpliciter, for, it turns out, there is no\nsuch person. (Strawson 1959: 191–192) \nSearle (1958) responds to the epistemic argument (see\n Section 2.3)\n by proposing a cluster theory. That argument seemed to show that\nindividual components of the cluster, such as taught Plato,\ncould not be necessary conditions on belonging to the name’s\nextension. For otherwise it would be knowable a priori that\nSocrates taught Plato. (Note that there is a similar problem with\ntreating it as a sufficient condition; for then it would be a\npriori that no-one other than Socrates taught Plato.) Instead,\nSearle suggests that a name’s meaning imposes the weaker\nrequirement that some member of the cluster be true of the\nreferent. On his account, it is only a priori that the\nreferent possesses the disjunction of the conditions of the\ncluster. (Note that this weak condition is unlikely to single out a\nreferent for the name; hence Searle does not seem to provide a\ncomplete picture of reference determination. But strengthening the\naccount would only make the a priori consequences\nstronger.) \nSearle’s escape route is blocked if one can show that, for any\nfinite list of the relevant sort (and for persons fully knowledgeable\nof the name’s meaning—see\n Section 2.3),\n it is conceivable that the true referent satisfies none of the\nconditions on the list. If clusters are finite lists of conditions,\nthen the theory predicts that there is some such list for which it is\na priori that the referent satisfies at least one of its\nconditions. \nOne way of so arguing would be to cultivate the intuition that any\nfinite list must be incomplete. Given any list, there is a conceivable\nscenario in which some further property—one that was left off\nthe list—proves crucial in determining the name’s\nreference. This kind of argument was used by Friedrich Waismann (1945)\nto demonstrate the “open texture” of empirical predicates,\nsuch as “gold” and “cat”. But it seems that\nthe list of factors that could conceivably be relevant to determining\nthe referent of “Socrates” is similarly open ended. If\nthis hunch is correct, then the best we could hope for from a finite\ncluster theory is a kind of ceteris paribus determination:\n \nIf such-and-such facts obtain and no other facts relevant to the\ndetermination of the reference of “Socrates”, then\n“Socrates” refers to so-and-so. \nKripke (1980: 66–67) argues that, so long as our cluster\nconsists only of properties commonly attributed to the bearer of the\nname, as on Strawson’s account, it is conceivable that none of\nits members applies to the referent. His case is buoyed by examples\nwhere experts posit or even identify a historical figure behind a\npopular legend, and treat the historical personage, who might share\nnone of the attributes of the legendary one, as the true referent of\nthe name. We might respond by applying Strawson’s method to the\ncommunity of experts, rather than the general populace where the\nlegend holds sway, as it would then succeed in picking out the\nhistorical figure. However, the general observation is that no group\nis incorrigible. Even those experts could turn out, it seems, to be\nwholly wrong in their descriptions of the name’s referent (as\nrevealed, perhaps, by a new wave of experts). \nKripke thus provides a direct challenge to a cluster theory based on\nidentifying descriptions. A complication is that Strawson explicitly\ncountenances identifying descriptions that are parasitic on other\nspeakers’ use (such as the individual Plato referred to as\n“Socrates”). Kripke attempts to repulse this\nmaneuver, noting that the reference of one’s own utterance of a\nname is ultimately determined by the reference of the person from whom\none in fact learned the name, rather than the person one might\nmistakenly identify as such (1980: 90–91; see also Geach 1969:\n288–289; and Donnellan 1970). \nSuppose we could craft a version of the cluster theory that was\nmaterially correct (it satisfies all of our intuitions about the\nreference of the name in different eventualities). We might\nlegitimately ask, as we have done before, whether this theory succeeds\nin giving the meaning of the name. It seems that many have favored\nthis conclusion chiefly for want of an alternative: if a cluster of\ncommonly attributed features is not the meaning of a name, then what\nis? Or if, alternatively, names don’t have meanings, then what\ncould it be that determines their extension? We will supply one\ngeneral answer to the second of these questions in the next\nsection. \nThe range of application of the noun “bachelor” is\ndetermined in two steps. First, something (we haven’t seen what)\nestablishes that “bachelor” means man who has never\nbeen married. Second, “bachelor” applies to all and\nonly those things that satisfy the condition specified in its\nmeaning—the men who have never been married. If names have\nmeanings, then their referents or ranges (in the case of generic\nnames) will be determined in the same way. However, many philosophers\nhave found the view that names do not have a meaning intuitively\ncompelling (Mill 1843: 34, 36–37; Strawson 1950; Ziff 1960:\n85–89, 93–94; Marcus 1961). They still believe names\nrefer, and so require an alternative metasemantics—an account,\nin this case, of what determines reference—to the\nmeaning-mediated one. \nThe now standard alternative to the meaning-mediated model is one on\nwhich reference (or range) is directly established by use.\nThe referent is the referent (or the range the range) because it\nsatisfies a particular condition, but that condition amounts to\nconsistency with past use, rather than encapsulating the meaning of\nthe expression. Proponents of the use model tend to emphasize the\nexternalism of this determining use. For\nexample, in the quote below, Evans elaborates the rough idea of the\nreferent being known as NN by citing the “actual\npattern of dealings” with the referent—by which he means\nspecifically the occasions where the referent has been identified as\nNN by certain members of the community (the “producers” of\nthe particular name-using practice)—rather than basing it on the\nrecognitional capacities that enable the identification (which would\nhew closer to Strawson). \nIt seems reasonable to suggest that what makes it the case that an\nordinary proper-name-using practice involving the name\n“NN” concerns a particular individual is that that\nindividual should be known to the producers in the practice as\nNN. It is the actual pattern of dealings the producers have had\nwith an individual—identified from time to time by the exercise\nof their recognitional capacities in regard to that\nindividual—which ties the name to the individual. (Evans 1982:\n382, emphasis in the original) \nWe will now look, in a general way, at how the reference of a name\ncould be determined by other aspects of its use. Our approach will\nsingle out attribution (of a name to someone)\nas the relevant basis. Other approaches are possible, but the\n(technical) notion of attribution will be broad enough to cover the\nuse theories of Evans and Kripke. \nTo refer is to use an expression to identify some individual, usually\nin order to talk about them. Attribution of a name, by contrast,\nrequires the attributee to be identified (at least partially)\nindependently of the deployment of the name. To attribute a name to\nsomeone is just to treat someone—thus extrinsically\nidentified—as belonging to its extension; to assert or\npresuppose that the name applies to them. A straightforward example,\nwhere the attributee is identified by a gesture (or her proximity),\nwould be: \nOthers include vocative address (“Hello, Miranda!”), where\nthe name is attributed to the addressee, and stipulation (“Let\nthis one be Zappa”). Constructions with appellative verbs like\n“call” are tailor-made for name attribution (“Call\nme Ishmael”), but attribution may also be discerned in the\nbackground of a more casual kind of utterance. Even “Homer was a\nmaster of narrative” could be seen to presuppose an attribution\nof “Homer” to the author of certain narrative works (Evans\n1982: 394–395). \nAttributions can be to individuals identified by description\nas well as by acquaintance. As we will see, Evans restricts\ncanonical applications by fiat to the by-acquaintance variety, while\nKripke seems to allow both sorts (1980: 94). \nThe main tenet of the use theory, as we will understand it, is that an\nutterance of a name is constrained in its reference by a set of prior\napplications. Assuming, for the moment, that the applications in that\nset were all to one individual (the same one was independently\nidentified in each case), then the utterance is simply constrained to\nrefer to that individual (in order, as we might put it, to be\nconsistent with those past applications). The use theory in outline is\nalmost the same as Strawson’s view that the reference of a name\nis determined by the identifying descriptions associated with it in\nthe minds of its users, except that it replaces users’\ndispositions to identify the referent of a name in a certain way with\ntheir public acts of committing to particular identifications. \nAnother difference exhibited by the use theories of Kripke and Evans\nis their flight from Strawson’s democratic approach to\nidentification (Kripke 1980: 65). Both philosophers distinguish a\nproper subset of the applications of a name as canonical for\ndetermining its reference (see also Putnam 1975). \nIndeed, only one attribution is authoritative on the picture Kripke\noffers: an inaugurating stipulation that tyrannically governs all\nsubsequent use. The paradigm of this initiating act is the naming\nceremony, where a name is officially conferred on a person or thing.\nSince no subsequent attribution can alter the reference of downstream\nuse, Kripke’s account makes no allowance for reference change\n(each “change” in fact requires the institution of a new\nspecific name, with a new inaugural event). \nEvans loosens Kripke’s restriction to allow for the influence of\nsubsequent attributions, and hence makes it possible to model change\nin the reference of a name. On his account, the authoritative\napplications are those of the (current) “producers” of a\nname-using practice—those in a position to make identifications\nbased on direct acquaintance, as they are capable of recognizing the\nindividual to which they attribute the name (Evans 1982:\n376–377). Those who are not producers—the\nconsumers—have a more limited role in the practice. While they\ncan use the name to refer to the relevant individual, their own\nattributions need not be consistent with its reference. \nStandard use theories provide vague guidelines for selecting the set\nof historical attributions (the “precedent”) that\nconstrains the reference of a particular utterance. For Kripke,\nselection involves tracing back the (intentionally mediated)\nhistorical chain from the utterance to an initial naming ceremony. For\nEvans it requires resolving the utterance to its proper name-using\npractice (a process he conceives of on the model of lexical\ndisambiguation), and then sifting out the attributions of the\nproducers in that practice. \nIt follows that Kripke is committed to the coreference of\n(appropriately) historically connected name-utterances, while Evans is\ncommitted to the coreference of all (simultaneous) utterances\nbelonging to the one practice. It is worth noting that a use theory\nneed not carry either of these commitments. We might instead,\nfollowing Donnellan (1974: 16), take the relevant applications to be\nthose that contribute to the historically correct explanation of the\nutterance in question. Since the same speaker, manifestly intending to\ncontribute to the same name-using practice, might utter the same name\nin pursuit of different goals, and hence with differing overall\nexplanations for each of their utterances, Donnellan’s account\ndoes not carry the constraints of the other theories (for some pros\nand cons, see Donnellan 1970: 349–351 and Evans 1973: 202). \nIf the precedent consists of more than one attribution, the theory\nadditionally needs some way to resolve conflicts—cases where one\nattribution is to x, while another is to y. We could say\nthat any conflict in the precedent results in either reference failure\n(Evans 1982: 389) or referential indeterminacy (Lewis 1984). But we\ncan also imagine a more nuanced rule that prioritized certain\nproperties in the event of a conflict (the way Evans prioritizes the\napplications of producers over those of consumers). \nIn sum, the general framework for a use theory has it that a set of\nattributions P provides a constraint on the reference of an\nutterance u of a name (the theory may provide a means of\ndetermining P from u and its circumstances, or, at the\nextreme of relativism, will only say that reference is dependent on a\nchoice of precedent P). Each element \\(P_i\\) of P\ncontributes a general descriptive or situational feature that serves\nto identify the subject of the application (think of each \\(P_i\\) as a\nproperty, applied at the world of utterance). Additionally, the use\ntheory may specify a priority relation on P (or other means of\nresolving conflicts). The result is a condition (we can call it\n\\(C(u)\\) if we assume that an utterance u determines this\ncondition, by determining its proper precedent) that specifies the\nconstraint on the reference of the utterance required by consistency\nwith its proper precedent of attributions. \nThe general use theory we have just described has an obvious affinity\nwith the cluster theory discussed just prior to it. The set of\ncanonical attributions in the use theory boils down to a cluster of\nconditions that jointly determine reference. Theories of both sorts\nare specified by providing a means of selecting the set, and a means\nof resolving conflicts among the properties in the set (in the event\nthat it does not turn out to be unitary). \nUse theories, like cluster theories, can be seen as open-ended in what\ncounts towards reference (I was careful to allow for this in the\ngeneral statement at the end of the previous section). Even an\nopen-ended cluster theory can issue in ceteris paribus claims\nsuch as: if these are the only considerations operating in the case,\nthen the reference is to so-and-so. In use theories, this\nopen-endedness crops up (at least) in the choice of precedent; so that\nthe best we might say, in some cases, is: if we fix the precedent like\nthis, then the reference is to such-and-such. Though we are certainly\nnot at a loss in deciding the proper precedent for any particular\ncase, it is difficult to say in general and with precision which\napplications should count. Evans’ invocation of a name-using\npractice is too vague to guide us in concretely described cases, and\nKripke explicitly disclaims that he is providing a prediction-making\ntheory of nominal reference. \nIf we generalize cluster theories to allow them to include identifying\nproperties extracted from use (instead of restricting them to\ndispositional identifying descriptions), we can treat use theories as\na species of cluster theory. Indeed, a general umbrella is a good idea\nif it turns out that dispositional identifying descriptions play a\npart in determining reference alongside “the actual pattern of\ndealings” (see Lewis 1984: 226–27, for this argument, and\nUnger 1983 for the cases on which it is based). For example, Evans\nobserves that one’s utterance of “Anir” cannot refer\nto King Arthur’s son if one believes it to be the name of\nArthur’s burial place instead (1973: 198; see Dickie 2011 for a\nhost of similar examples). \nWe have already noted that a cluster theory need not give the meaning\nof a name; that adopting one is consistent with thinking that names\nare meaningless. Our example, recall, was Strawson, who denied the\nmeaningfulness of names (he would not even grant them a rule of use),\nyet thought their reference was determined by a cluster of identifying\ndescriptions. On the other hand, one might have reasons for thinking\nthe cluster—even one that includes properties derived from\nuse—accurately represents the meaning of a name (this appears,\nfor instance, to be Lewis’s view). Finally, the cluster could\ncomprise influences from meaning alongside influences from use, with\nthe rule for adjudicating conflict, in part, deciding between factors\nof those different types. \nA direct argument for the claim that a name’s meaning is the\ncluster condition determining its reference comes from a consideration\nof claims of nonexistence (or “negative\nexistentials”): \nConsider this example. If one says “Moses did not exist”,\nthis may mean various things. It may mean: the Israelites did not have\na single leader when they withdrew from Egypt—or: their\nleader was not called Moses—or: there cannot have been anyone\nwho accomplished all that the Bible relates of Moses—or etc.,\netc. (Wittgenstein 1953: sec. 79) \nThere is something compelling about Wittgenstein’s observation.\nThe three alternatives he outlines (while being clear they are not\nexhaustive) describe different kinds of situation in which we might\nwell agree that Moses did not exist. While one could claim that the\nsentence is ambiguous, with an interpretation analyzed in each of\nthese ways at least, this is not what Wittgenstein has in mind. This\nis a good thing, since “Moses did not exist” cannot\nliterally mean that the Israelites did not have a single\nleader, as it is certainly conceivable that Moses existed but did not\nlead the Israelites (Kripke 1980: 66–67). Instead, we must treat\nhis alternatives in the manner already suggested for the components of\na cluster theory: as conditions that are neither strictly necessary\nnor inevitably sufficient, but which instead count as factors in favor\nof the nonexistence claim, interacting with an open-ended set of other\nfactors both for and against. Perhaps, indeed, Wittgenstein himself\nheld this view in an inchoate way: \nHas the name “Moses” got a fixed and unequivocal use for\nme in all possible cases?—Is it not the case that I have, so to\nspeak, a whole series of props in readiness, and am ready to lean on\none if another should be taken from under me, and vice versa?\n(Wittgenstein 1953: sec. 79) \nIntuitions aside, negative existentials pose a serious challenge to\nthe view that names have no meaning. The difficulty is most acute on\nthe view that names only contribute their referent to the truth\ncondition of an utterance (but see Kripke 2013; Braun 1993; the papers in\nEverett & Hofweber 2000); there is a way out, sketched below, for\none willing to treat nonreferring names as still contributing a sense\n(which, as you will recall from\n Section 2.2,\n is consistent with the claim that names have no linguistic\nmeaning). \nGenerally speaking, the point of a singular negative existential\ncannot be to make a (false) claim about a certain individual, referred\nto by the singular term in the subject position, to the effect that\nthat individual does not exist. In this way, singular negative\nexistentials differ from run-of-the-mill utterances, such as: \nLet C(“Socrates”) stand for the (putative) cluster\ncondition that determines the referent of “Socrates”. We\nare able to state the condition under which (6) is true as: \nWhile (7) is an accurate statement of the truth condition of (6), it\nmay not be the truth condition we get when we put together the\nsemantic contributions of the parts. (Once again, following Kripke,\nBurge and others, we must maintain a distinction between the semantic\ncontribution—or semantic value—of\nan uttered expression, and that expression’s linguistic\nmeaning.) In particular, if we think that “Socrates”\ncontributes its referent (and only its referent) to the compositional\ntruth condition of a sentence, then we will prefer the following\nstatement (where s is an individual constant denoting\nSocrates): \nIf a name does not refer (take a name such as Urbain Le\nVerrier’s “Vulcan” or Algernon’s\n“Bunbury”—from Wilde’s play, The\nImportance of Being Earnest), then we obviously lack the option\nof expressing a truth condition that cites its referent. If a claim\ninvolving an empty name has a truth condition at all, it would have to\nbe a condition that, like (7), incorporates the condition that\ndetermines reference, rather than one that, like (8), incorporates the\nreferent itself. \nWe might not require a truth condition for statements like\n“Bunbury drank hemlock” or “This is a fine red\none” where nothing is demonstrated (cf. Strawson 1950: 333).\nThose sentences aren’t true, and perhaps don’t make\ntruth-evaluable claims at all. But Wittgenstein has drawn our\nattention to negative existentials, and we do have a grip on the sort\nof situations in which they would turn out to be true. If\nC(“Moses”) represents the cluster condition that\nsingles out Moses in all those situations in which we would say he did\nexist, then the truth condition for (9a) could be represented as (9b),\nbut not as (9c). \nNow suppose, for a moment, we agree with Davidson (1967) that (i) when\nwe state the truth condition of a sentence in the right way, we give\nits semantic value. If the truth condition of (9a) cannot be stated as\n(9c), then that leaves (9b) as the remaining candidate for the\nsemantic value of the sentence. And (ii) if the semantic value of a\nsentence is determined by the semantic values of its parts, then\nC(“Moses”) must be the contribution of\n“Moses” (or possibly some larger constituent including\n“Moses”). Since we distinguish meaning and semantic value,\nit doesn’t follow directly that C(“Moses”) is\nthe meaning of “Moses”. However, we cannot, according to\nthis argument, think of C(“Moses”) as a mere\nmetasemantic condition (perhaps derived from use), because\nmetasemantic conditions determine the semantic values of expressions,\nrather than vice versa. \nEither premise (i)–(ii) in this argument could be challenged.\nSo, one could distinguish the (compositional) semantic value of a\nsentence from its truth condition. It would then be possible to say\nthat a name that does not refer makes no contribution to the semantic\nvalue of a sentence, and even that a sentence containing an empty name\ndoes not have a semantic value, while still maintaining that (9b)\ngives the correct truth condition for “Moses does not\nexist”. This is the approach of Donnellan (1974: 25), for whom\nthe compositional semantic value of an uttered sentence is the\nproposition that it expresses—not quite its truth condition.\nWhile the utterance is true if that proposition holds and false if it\nfails to hold, Donnellan also thinks it may be true or false even if\nno proposition is generated. In particular, he proposes a rule that\nwould make a nonexistence statement true if generation fails in\nparticular way: specifically, if the historical explanation of its\nsingular subject’s use does not serve to identify any\nappropriate individual. \nA different approach would replace\nC(“Moses”)—which is just shorthand for a\ncluster condition—with a truly metalinguistic condition, one\nthat includes the reference relation itself. Note that (10) entails\n(9b), given that C(“Moses”) is the condition that\ndetermines the referent of “Moses”. \nMetalinguistic analyses of nonexistence statements face certain\nobjections. One is that “Moses did not exist” and its\ntranslation into French have different semantic values, since they say\nof different words that they don’t refer to someone who once\nlived. This particular problem could be addressed if there was a\ncommon sense—associated with at most one\nreferent—expressed by English speakers uttering\n“Moses” and French speakers uttering its translation\n“Moïse” (see Cumming 2013 for a proposal). The truth\ncondition could then replace parochial reference to language with\nreference to sense. If we let \\(\\delta\\) denote the sense expressed by\n“Moses”, then the truth condition would be: \nA further advantage of (11) is that we can give a compositional\nsemantics on which “Moses” contributes its sense,\n\\(\\delta\\), while the predicate contributes the existential\nquantification over the variable x as well as the relation\nconnecting the sense of an expression to its referent (glossed simply\nas refers in (11)). Musan (1997) and others\nhave given empirical arguments that a large class of predicates (those\nthat are not “existence independent” in her terminology)\nhave such an existential component to their meaning. It is eminently\nreasonable to place “exists” in their company. \nA parallel compositional treatment of (10) would have\n“Moses” contributing itself (as though it occurred in a\nquotation). It perhaps seems more plausible, should we opt for (10),\nto carve the truth condition up differently, so that we assign\n“Moses” the metalinguistic meaning the individual\nreferred to by “Moses”. We will now turn to a\nconsideration of such a metalinguistic account of the meaning of\nnames. \nThe nominal phrase N in a definite description “the\nN” contributes a condition that should be sufficient to\ndiscriminate the referent of the description from its local\ndistractors. If I felicitously utter “the red one”, then\nyou should be able to successfully identify the referent I have in\nmind on the basis of its being red. In this case, the condition that\nserves for identification in context is not specific enough to\ndetermine the referent outright—there are of course many red\nthings in existence other than the one I refer to. \nAs referring expressions, names can be seen to work in a similar way\n(compare Gray 2014: 216). In a felicitous utterance of\n“Alice”, some one individual is identified to the\naudience. In the case of names, the discriminating condition is\nmetalinguistic: the referent of the utterance is distinguished from\ndistractors by her feature of being called\n“Alice”. \nThis parallel suggests that a syntactic constituent of the\nname—the proper nominal phrase—contributes this\nmetalinguistic property; and the (generic) name “Alice”,\nas a whole, means the individual called\n“Alice”. \nThis compositional theory of a name’s import is corroborated by\nseveral pieces of circumstantial evidence. First, many names,\nincluding certain names of places and things in English and of people\nin Greek and other languages, actually incorporate a definite\ndeterminer (“the” in English). This suggests that names\nmight have a compositional semantics just like that of a definite\ndescription, where the determiner meaning combines with a property\ncontributed by the nominal complement to generate the meaning of the\noverall phrase. \nSecond, when a proper nominal occurs with other kinds of overt\ndeterminer, it often takes a metalinguistic meaning (Sloat 1969; Burge\n1973): \nThe (proper) nominal “Alice” in (12) has a meaning one\nmight parse as being called “Alice”; or, even\nmore specifically, since (12) is a written sentence, as having a\nname spelled A-l-i-c-e (Gray 2015). \nOn the other hand, the metalinguistic property attributed to the\nproper nominal appears superfluous in accounting for the way a name\nidentifies its referent to the audience. The fact that the referent of\nthe speaker’s use of “Alice” is called\n“Alice” is something that can reasonably be inferred from\nthe form of the referring expression alone, and doesn’t require\naccess to its meaning. It is a familiar point that we should think\ntwice before attributing to meaning an inference that requires nothing\nmore than common sense (Grice 1975). Indeed, it is not clear that such\nan interpretation could belong to a conventional meaning, since a\nconvention requires a possible alternative, and there is no\nalternative to taking an utterance of “Alice” to narrow\nthe field to those individuals who are called “Alice”. \nThis brings us to a circularity objection brought against the\nmetalinguistic view (Strawson 1950: 340; Kripke 1980: 68–70).\nOne way of explicating having a name spelled A-l-i-c-e is to\nsay that there is a linguistic item—a specific name with that\nspelling—referring to one. Thus (12) says in effect that there\nare two individuals in the class referred to by such a name. This\nwould be consistent with an account on which specific names (unlike\nproper nominals occurring in contexts like (12)) do not have a\nmeaning, their reference being determined by use instead. More\ngenerally, this explication treats the reference of specific names as\nthe more basic notion, and the predicate meaning of the proper nominal\nas defined in terms of such reference. \nTo think of names (not nominals) as having a metalinguistic meaning\nwhich then (partially) determines their reference, reverses this\npicture. Instead of the metalinguistic meaning being explicated in\nterms of the reference of names, the reference of names would be\nexplained with the help of the metalinguistic meaning. To avoid a\ntheory in which the explanation goes in a circle, the metalinguistic\npredicate having a name spelled A-l-i-c-e must be explicated\nin terms other than those of the reference of names. \nFortunately, we already have the materials at hand to see how this\ncould go. Back in\n Section 2.7,\n we distinguished the attribution of a name to someone (previously\nidentified) from the act of referring to someone with a name. It would\nbe quite natural to interpret a metalinguistic predicate as applying\nto someone on the basis of a pattern of attributions of a name, rather\nthan on that of reference to them using that name. Indeed, the\nordinary sense of “calling someone Alice” is a reasonable\ngloss of the technical notion of attributing the name Alice to them\n(Evans in fact employs this terminology—see his 1982: 383). So,\nfor instance, I could not have mistakenly called someone Alice without\nidentifying them independently, and people I refer to with a name but\ncan’t identify independently—for instance people whose\nnames I am reading off a roll—have not, intuitively speaking,\nbeen called that name by me. \nEven if name attribution is not the right way to ground metalinguistic\npredicates, any use theory, in attempting to explain the reference of\na name in terms of (distinct) features of its use, will have to employ\nsomething of the sort. In that sense, use theories and metalinguistic\ntheories are in the same boat. Of course, what ends up working for one\nwon’t necessarily work for the other. However, it does not seem\nthat the metalinguistic theory is uniquely afflicted by a circularity\nobjection, but rather both theories stand in need of a suitable\nreductive base (for related discussion, see Burge 1973: 428; Geurts\n1997: 326–327; Bach 2002: 83; Fara 2011; Gray 2014; Rami 2014:\n858; García-Carpintero 2017: 25). \nThe decision whether to grant a metalinguistic meaning to names\nappears to come down to what is basic and what is generated in the\nsemantic theory. If the meaning of a name is generated from the\nmetalinguistic meaning of the constituent proper nominal, then names\nwill accordingly have a metalinguistic meaning (most likely in the\nform of a rule of use). If instead names are treated as basic by the\nsemantics, then there is less motivation to assign them such a meaning\n(we shouldn’t simply do so by default, as already discussed in\n Section 2.5). \nBut to treat both names and metalinguistically interpreted nominal\npredicates as semantically basic is generally thought to be inferior\ntheoretical economy (Gray 2017: 436–437). This is surely too\nquick; a nominal predicate, though semantically basic, would still\ncount as a natural expression of the metalinguistic property\nit denotes (see Johnson 2018), and the naturalness of the choice could\nexplain the prevalence of the convention across languages and its ease\nof uptake. In any event, a parallel attempt is made on the\nanti-metalinguistic side to generate the metalinguistic\ninterpretations of proper nominals from existing resources\n(Boëer 1975: 395; Leckie 2013; Jeshion 2015: 381; Gray\n2017). However, unless those basic resources include the references of\nnames (and Gray 2017 argues that this is hardly a promising route),\nthe metalinguistic theory is welcome to adopt the same\nthrift. There’s nothing in the metalinguistic account that says\nthe metalinguistic predicates are themselves basic, just that they are\nmore basic than the meanings of names constructed out of them. \nDialectically speaking, then, the crucial issue appears to be the\ncompositional derivation of the name’s meaning. I will go over a\nlittle of the linguistic data that has appeared so far in the debate.\nMuch of this data would appear, out of context, as the sheerest\nminutia. But the fate of what has recently been regarded as the best\nprospect for assigning a meaning to a proper name comes down to the\ninterpretation of these details. \nFirstly, a problem arises for the metalinguistic account when the name\nincludes an overt determiner (Cumming 2007: 22). “The\nBronx” consists of the determiner “the” and the\nproper nominal “Bronx”. According to a compositional\naccount of its meaning, it should refer to the most salient entity\ncalled “Bronx”. However, the northernmost borough of New\nYork City is not called “Bronx”; it is called “the\nBronx”. Furthermore, despite the fact that this borough is\ncalled the Bronx, we do not refer to it using an expression that\ncombines a phrase that expresses this metalinguistic property with a\ndefinite determiner, as the compositional theory would predict. We\ndon’t use “the the Bronx”, which might be seen as\nsuch a combination (with “the Bronx” expressing the\nproperty of being called the Bronx). Nor is it plausible that\n“the Bronx” sports a covert definite determiner, as the\novert “the” is not fused with “Bronx” into a\nproper nominal phrase, but is dropped in such expressions as “a\nBronx resident”. \nThis drawback of the metalinguistic theory is concealed when we\nrestrict our consideration to proper names that can\noccur—optionally or obligatorily—without an article, names\nsuch as “Alice” or “(the) George Washington\nBridge”. The George Washington Bridge also happens to be called\nGeorge Washington Bridge—in the sense that people also refer to\nit this way (and attribute the name sans article to it). But this\nappears an accident of naming, rather than a vindication of the\ncompositional view. There are many names that fit the formula of\n“the Bronx” instead. The World Cup is not, properly\nspeaking, called (just) World Cup; the Eiffel Tower is not called\nEiffel Tower (the way Sears Tower is); the Mona Lisa is not called\nMona Lisa (though its subject, Lisa del Giocondo, was; and\ninterestingly, we would say that the painting is titled Mona\nLisa). \nThe situation is different if we confine our attention to personal\nnames. As mentioned earlier, in many languages outside English,\npersonal names come with a (definite) determiner. Matushansky (2008:\n580–581) provides evidence for a cross-linguistic pattern of\ndropping the determiner on personal names in naming environments like\n“is called”, just as the compositional account would\npredict. \nA problem remains even for a curtailed version of the metalinguistic\nview on which it applies only to personal names. It can be brought out\nwith data from English. It was originally claimed that “the\nAlice” (with neutral stress on “the”) was\nungrammatical, and hence that “Alice” accompanied by a\nnull determiner with the same meaning as “the” filled its\nslot in the paradigm (Sloat 1969). However, “the Alice” is\nnot ungrammatical, merely unusual. It is used when the possession of\nthe relevant metalinguistic property is particularly prominent. For\ninstance, when sorting people into groups based on their names, or\ncollecting examples of people with a particular name (Jeshion 2017:\n235; Gray 2017: 452). \nCritics of the metalinguistic view have noted subtle differences in\ninterpretation that prevent us from treating “Alice” as\nequivalent to the more clearly metalinguistic phrase “the\nAlice”. In each pair below, the (b) member allows the individual\nwho counts as the Alice to vary with the occasion, while the (a)\nmember doesn’t (Hawthorne & Manley 2012: 236–237; Fara\n2015c; Schoubye 2016). \nAnother difference is that “the Alice” licenses subsequent\none-anaphora, while “Alice” does not (King 2006; Jeshion\n2017: 238): \nA natural explanation of these differences is that a compositional\nsemantics on which the proper nominal contribute a metalinguistic\nproperty is correct for “the Alice”, but not for\n“Alice”.","contact.mail":"sam.cumming@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
