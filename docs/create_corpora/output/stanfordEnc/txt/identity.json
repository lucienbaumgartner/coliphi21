Various interrelated problems have been\nat the centre of discussion, but it is fair to say that recent work\nhas focussed particularly on the following areas: the notion of a\ncriterion of identity; the correct analysis of identity over time,\nand, in particular, the disagreement between advocates of perdurance\nand advocates of endurance as analyses of identity over time; the\nnotion of identity across possible worlds and the question of its\nrelevance to the correct analysis of de re modal discourse;\nthe notion of contingent identity; the question of whether the\nidentity relation is, or is similar to, the composition relation; and\nthe notion of vague identity. A radical position, advocated by Peter\nGeach, is that these debates, as usually conducted, are void for lack\nof a subject matter: the notion of\nabsolute identity they presuppose has no application; there\nis only relative identity. Another increasingly popular view\nis the one advocated by Lewis: although the debates make sense they\ncannot genuinely be debates about identity, since there are no\nphilosophical problems about identity. Identity is an utterly\nunproblematic notion.  What there are, are genuine problems which can\nbe stated using the language of identity. But since these can be\nrestated without the language of identity they are not problems about\nidentity. (For example, it is a puzzle, an aspect of the so-called\n“problem of personal identity”, whether the same\nperson can have different bodies at different times. But this is just\nthe puzzle whether a person can have different bodies at\ndifferent times.  So since it can be stated without the language of\npersonal “identity”, it is not a problem about\npersonal identity, but about personhood.) This article\nprovides an overview of the topics indicated above, some assessment of\nthe debates and suggestions for further reading.\n\n\n\nTo say that things are identical is to say that they are the same.\n“Identity” and “sameness” mean the same; their\nmeanings are identical. However, they have more than one meaning. A\ndistinction is customarily drawn between qualitative and\nnumerical identity or sameness. Things with qualitative\nidentity share properties, so things can be more or less qualitatively\nidentical. Poodles and Great Danes are qualitatively identical because\nthey share the property of being a dog, and such properties as go along\nwith that, but two poodles will (very likely) have greater qualitative\nidentity. Numerical identity requires absolute, or total, qualitative\nidentity, and can only hold between a thing and itself. Its name\nimplies the controversial view that it is the only identity relation in\naccordance with which we can properly count (or number) things:\nx and y are to be properly counted as one just in\ncase they are numerically identical (Geach 1973). \n\nNumerical identity is our topic. As noted, it is at the centre of\nseveral philosophical debates, but to many seems in itself wholly\nunproblematic, for it is just that relation everything has to itself\nand nothing else – and what could be less problematic than that?\nMoreover, if the notion is problematic it is difficult to see how the\nproblems could be resolved, since it is difficult to see how a thinker\ncould have the conceptual resources with which to explain the concept\nof identity whilst lacking that concept itself. The basicness of the\nnotion of identity in our conceptual scheme, and, in particular, the\nlink between identity and quantification has been particularly noted by\nQuine (1964). \n\nNumerical identity can be characterised, as just done, as the\nrelation everything has to itself and to nothing else. But this is\ncircular, since “nothing else” just means “no\nnumerically non-identical thing”. It can be defined, equally\ncircularly (because quantifying over all equivalence relations\nincluding itself), as the smallest equivalence relation (an equivalence\nrelation being one which is reflexive, symmetric and transitive, for\nexample, having the same shape). Other circular definitions are\navailable. Usually it is defined as the equivalence relation (or: the\nreflexive relation) satisfying Leibniz’s Law, the principle of the\nindiscernibility of identicals, that if x is identical with\ny then everything true of x is true of y.\nIntuitively this is right, but only picks out identity uniquely if\n“what is true of x” is understood to include\n“being identical with x”; otherwise it is too\nweak. Circularity is thus not avoided. Nevertheless, Leibniz’s Law\nappears to be crucial to our understanding of identity, and, more\nparticularly, to our understanding of distinctness: we exhibit our\ncommitment to it whenever we infer from “Fa” and\n“Not-Fb” that a is not identical with\nb. Strictly, what is being employed in such inferences is the\ncontrapositive of Leibniz’s Law (if something true of a is\nfalse of b, a is not identical with b),\nwhich some (in the context of the discussion of vague identity) have\nquestioned, but it appears as indispensable to our grip on the concept\nof identity as Leibniz’s Law itself. \n\nThe converse of Leibniz’s Law, the principle of the identity of\nindiscernibles, that if everything true of x is true of\ny, x is identical with y, is correspondingly\ntrivial if “what is true of x” is understood to\ninclude “being identical with y” (as required if\nLeibniz’s Law is to characterise identity uniquely among equivalence\nrelations). But often it is read with “what is true of\nx” restricted, e.g., to qualitative, non-relational,\nproperties of x. It then becomes philosophically\ncontroversial. Thus it is debated whether a symmetrical universe is\npossible, e.g., a universe containing two qualitatively\nindistinguishable spheres and nothing else (Black 1952). \n\nLeibniz’s Law has itself been subject to controversy in the sense\nthat the correct explanation of apparent counter-examples has been\ndebated. Leibniz’s Law must be clearly distinguished from the\nsubstitutivity principle, that if “a” and\n“b” are codesignators (if\n“a=b” is a true sentence of English) they\nare everywhere substitutable salva veritate. This principle is\ntrivially false. “Hesperus” contains eight letters,\n“Phosphorus” contains ten, but Hesperus (the Evening Star)\nis Phosphorus (the Morning Star). Again, despite the identity, it is\ninformative to be told that Hesperus is Phosphorus, but not to be told\nthat Hesperus is Hesperus (“On Sense and Reference” in\nFrege 1969). Giorgione was so-called because of his size, Barbarelli\nwas not, but Giorgione was Barbarelli (Quine, “Reference and\nModality”, in 1963) . It is a necessary truth that 9 is greater\nthan 7, it is not a necessary truth that the number of planets is\ngreater than 7, although 9 is the number of planets. The explanation of\nthe failure of the substitutivity principle can differ from case to\ncase. In the first example, it is plausible to say that\n“‘Hesperus’ contains eight letters” is not\nabout Hesperus, but about the name, and the same is true, mutatis\nmutandis, of “‘Phosphorus’ contains ten\nletters”. Thus the names do not have the same referents in the\nidentity statement and the predications. In the Giorgione/Barbarelli\nexample this seems less plausible. Here the correct explanation is\nplausibly that “is so-called because of his size” expresses\ndifferent properties depending on the name it is attached to, and so\nexpresses the property of being called “Barbarelli” because\nof his size when attached to “Barbarelli” and being called\n“Giorgione” because of his size when attached to\n“Giorgione”. It is more controversial how to explain the\nHesperus/Phosphorus and 9/the number of planets examples. Frege’s own\nexplanation of the former was to assimilate it to the\n“Hesperus”/“Phosphorus” case: in “It is\ninformative to be told that Hesperus is Phosphorus” the names do\nnot stand for their customary referent but for their senses. A Fregean\nexplanation of the 9/number of planets example may also be offered:\n“it is necessary that” creates a context in which numerical\ndesignators stand for senses rather than numbers. \n\nFor present purposes the important point to recognise is that,\nhowever these counter-examples to the substitutivity principle are\nexplained, they are not counter-examples to Leibniz’s Law, which says\nnothing about substitutivity of codesignators in any language. \n\nThe view of identity just put forward (henceforth “the\nclassical view”) characterises it as the equivalence relation\nwhich everything has to itself and to nothing else and which satisfies\nLeibniz’s Law. These formal properties ensure that, within any theory\nexpressible by means of a fixed stock of one- or many-place predicates,\nquantifiers and truth-functional connectives, any two predicates which\ncan be regarded as expressing identity (i.e., any predicates satisfying\nthe two schemata “for all x, Rxx” and\n“for all x, for all y, Rxy →\n(Fx → Fy)” for any one-place predicate in\nplace of “F”) will be extensionally equivalent.\nThey do not, however, ensure that any two-place predicate does express\nidentity within a particular theory, for it may simply be that the\ndescriptive resources of the theory are insufficiently rich to\ndistinguish items between which the equivalence relation expressed by\nthe predicate holds (“Identity” in Geach 1972). \n\nFollowing Geach, call a two-place predicate with these properties in\na theory an “I-predicate” in that theory. Relative to\nanother, richer, theory the same predicate, interpreted in the same\nway, may not be an I-predicate. If so it will not, and did not even in\nthe poorer theory, express identity. For example, “having the\nsame income as” will be an I-predicate in a theory in which\npersons with the same income are indistinguishable, but not in a richer\ntheory. \n\nQuine (1950) has suggested that when a predicate is an I-predicate in\na theory only because the language in which the theory is expressed\ndoes not allow one to distinguish items between which it holds, one\ncan reinterpret the sentences of the theory so that the I-predicate in\nthe newly interpreted theory does express identity. Every sentence\nwill have just the same truth-conditions under the new interpretation\nand the old, but the references of its subsentential parts will be\ndifferent. Thus, Quine suggests, if one has a language in which one\nspeaks of persons and in which persons of the same income are\nindistinguishable the predicates of the language may be reinterpreted\nso that the predicate which previously expressed having the same\nincome comes now to express identity. The universe of discourse\nnow consists of income groups, not people. The extensions of the\nmonadic predicates are classes of income groups, and, in general, the\nextension of an\nn-place predicate is a class of n-member sequences of\nincome groups (Quine 1963: 65–79). Any two-place predicate expressing\nan equivalence relation could be an I-predicate relative to some\nsufficiently impoverished theory, and Quine’s suggestion will be\napplicable to any such predicate if it is applicable at all. \n\nBut it remains that it is not guaranteed that a two-place predicate\nthat is an I-predicate in the theory to which it belongs expresses\nidentity. In fact, no condition can be stated in a first-order language\nfor a predicate to express identity, rather than mere indiscernibility\nby the resources of the language. However, in a second-order language,\nin which quantification over all properties (not just those\nfor which the language contains predicates) is possible and Leibniz’s\nLaw is therefore statable, identity can be uniquely characterised.\nIdentity is thus not first-order, but only second-order definable. \n\nThis situation provides the basis for Geach’s radical contention that\nthe notion of absolute identity has no application and that there is\nonly relative identity. This section contains a brief discussion of\nGeach’s complex view. (For more details see the entry on\n relative identity,\n Deutsch 1997, Dummett 1981 and 1991, Hawthorne 2003\nand Noonan 2017.) Geach maintains that since no criterion can be given\nby which a predicate expressing an I-predicate may be determined to\nexpress, not merely indiscernibility relative to the language to which\nit belongs, but also absolute indiscernibility, we should jettison the\nclassical notion of identity (1991). He dismisses the possibility of\ndefining identity in a second-order language on the ground of the\nparadoxical nature of unrestricted quantification over properties and\naims his fire particularly at Quine’s proposal that an I-predicate in\na first-order theory may always be interpreted as expressing\nabsolute identity (even if such an interpretation is not\nrequired).  Geach objects that Quine’s suggestion leads to a\n“Baroque Meinongian ontology” and is inconsistent with\nQuine’s own expressed preference for “desert landscapes”\n(“Identity” in Geach 1972: 245). \n\nWe may usefully state Geach’s thesis using the terminology of\nabsolute and relative equivalence relations. Let us say that an\nequivalence relation R is absolute if and only if, if\nx stands in it to y, there cannot be some other\nequivalence relation S, holding between anything and either\nx or y, but not holding between x and\ny. If an equivalence relation is not absolute it is relative.\nClassical identity is an absolute equivalence relation. Geach’s main\ncontention is that any expression for an absolute equivalence relation\nin any possible language will have the null class as its extension, and\nso there can be no expression for classical identity in any possible\nlanguage. This is the thesis he argues against Quine. \n\nGeach also maintains the sortal relativity of identity statements,\nthat “x is the same A as y” does\nnot “split up” into “x is an A and\ny is an A and x=y”. More\nprecisely stated, what Geach denies is that whenever a term\n“A” is interpretable as a sortal term in a\nlanguage L (a term which makes (independent) sense following\n“the same”) the expression (interpretable as)\n“x is the same A as y” in\nlanguage L will be satisfied by a pair\n<x,y> only if the I-predicate of L is\nsatisfied by <x,y>. Geach’s thesis of the\nsortal relativity of identity thus neither entails nor is entailed by\nhis thesis of the inexpressibility of identity. It is the sortal\nrelativity thesis that is the central issue between Geach and Wiggins\n(1967 and 1980). It entails that a relation expressible in the form\n“x is the same A as y” in a\nlanguage L, where “A” is a sortal term in\nL, need not entail indiscernibility even by the resources of\nL. \n\nGeach’s argument against Quine exists in two versions, an earlier\nand a later. \n\nIn its earlier version the argument is merely that following Quine’s\nsuggestion to interpret a language in which some expression is an\nI-predicate so that the I-predicate expresses classical identity sins\nagainst a highly intuitive methodological programme enunciated by Quine\nhimself, namely that as our knowledge expands we should unhesitatingly\nexpand our ideology, our stock of predicables, but should be much more\nwary about altering our ontology, the interpretation of our bound name\nvariables (1972: 243). \n\nGeach’s argument is that in view of the mere possibility of carving\nout of a language L, in which the relational expressions,\nE1, E2,\nE3… are not I-predicates, sub-languages\nL1, L2,\nL3… in which these expressions are\nI-predicates, if Quine’s suggested proposal of reinterpretation is\npossible for each Ln, the user of\nL will be committed to any number of entities not quantified\nover in L, namely, for each Ln,\nthose entities for which the I-predicate of\nLn (En) gives\na criterion of absolute identity. This will be so because any sentence\nof L will retain its truth conditions in any\nLn to which it belongs, reinterpreted as\nQuine proposes, but “of course, it is flatly inconsistent to say\nthat as a member of a large theory a sentence retains its\ntruth-conditions but not its ontological commitment”\n(1973:299). \n\nThe crucial premiss of this argument is thus that sameness of\ntruth-conditions entails sameness of ontological commitment. But this\nis not true. The ontological commitments of a theory (according to\nQuine, whose notion this is) are those entities that must lie within\nthe domain of quantification of the theory if the theory is to be true;\nor, the entities the predicates of the theory have to be true of if the\ntheory is to be true. A theory is not ontologically committed, we may\nsay, to whatever has to be in the universe for it to be true,\nbut only to whatever has to be in its universe for it to be\ntrue. Thus there is no argument from sameness of truth-conditions to\nsameness of ontological commitments. \n\nThe later version of Geach’s argument needs a different response.\nThe difference between the earlier version and the later one is that in\nthe later (to be found in Geach 1973) Geach’s claim is not merely that\nQuine’s thesis about possible reinterpretation has a consequence which\nis unpalatable, but that it leads to an out-and-out logical absurdity,\nthe existence of what he calls “absolute surmen” (entities\nfor which having the same surname constitutes a criterion of absolute\nidentity, ie., entails indiscernibility in all respects). Because Geach\nis now making this stronger claim, the objection that his argument\ndepends upon the incorrect assumption that sameness of truth-conditions\nentails sameness of ontological commitment is no longer relevant. In\norder to make out his case Geach has to establish just two points.\nFirst, that there are sentences of English supplemented by the\npredicate “is the same surman as” (explained to mean\n“is a man and has the same surname as”), which are\nevidently true and which, considered as sentences of that fragment of\nEnglish in which “is the same surman as” is an I-predicate,\nwhen this is interpreted in the way Quine suggests, can be true only if\nabsolute surmen exist. And secondly, that the existence of absolute\nsurmen is absurd. \n\nBut in the end Geach fails to establish these two points. Quine would\nsay that, for the fragment of English in question, the domain of the\nvariables can be considered to consist of classes of men with the same\nsurname and the predicates interpreted as holding of such classes.\nThus, the predicate “is the same surman as” will no longer\nbe true of pairs of men if we adopt Quine’s suggestion\n(I am writing, remember in English, not in the fragment of English\nunder discussion), but rather of pairs of classes of men with the same\nsurname – these then will be Geach’s “absolute\nsurmen”. Now, Geach attempts to rule this out by the argument\nthat “whatever is a surman is by definition a man.” But\nthis argument fails. The predicate “is a man” will also be\nin the language-fragment in which “is the same surman as”\nis the I-predicate; and so it, too, will, be reinterpreted, if we\nfollow Quine’s suggestion, as holding of classes of men with the\nsame surname. Thus the sentence “Whatever is a surman is a\nman” will be true in the language fragment interpreted in\nQuine’s way, just as it is in English as a whole. What will not\nbe true, however, is that whatever the predicate “is a\nsurman” is true of, as it occurs in the language-fragment\nreinterpreted in Quine’s way, is a thing of which “is\na man”, as it occurs in English as a whole, is true\nof. But Geach has no right to demand that this should be the\ncase. Even so, this demand can be met. For the domain of the\ninterpretation of the language fragment in which “is the same\nsurman as” is the I-predicate can, in fact, be taken to consist\nof men, namely, to be a class containing exactly one representative\nman for each class of men with the same surname. Thus, as Geach says,\nabsolute surmen will be just some among men (1973, 100). Geach goes\non, “there will, for example, be just one surman with the\nsurname ‘Jones’, but if this is an absolute surman, and he\nis a certain man, then which of the Jones boys is he?” But this\nquestion, which is, of course, only answerable using predicates which\nbelong to the part of English not included in the language fragment in\nwhich “is the same surman as” is the I-predicate, is not\nan impossible one to answer. It is merely that the answer will depend\nupon the particular interpretation that the language fragment has, in\nfact, been given. Geach is, therefore not entitled to go on,\n“Surely we have run into an absurdity.” It thus seems that\nhis argument for the non-existence of absolute identity fails. \n\nGeach’s argument for his second thesis, that of the sortal\nrelativity of identity, is that it provides the best solution to a\nvariety of well known puzzles about identity and counting at a time and\nover time. The most well known puzzle is that of the cat on the mat,\nwhich comes in two versions. \n\nThe first version goes like this. (Wiggins 1968 contains the first\nappearance of this version in present-day philosophical literature; an\nequivalent puzzle is that of Dion and Theon, see Burke 1995.) Suppose\na cat, Tibbles, is sitting on a mat. Now consider that portion of\nTibbles that includes everything except its tail – its\n“tail complement” – and call it\n“Tib”. Tib is smaller than Tibbles so they are not\nidentical. But what if we now amputate the cat’s tail? (A\ntime-reversed, or “growing”, version can be considered in\nwhich a tail is grafted on to a tailless cat; the same responses\nconsidered below will be available, but may differ in relative\nplausibility.) Tibbles and Tib will now coincide. If Tibbles is still\na cat, it is hard to see by what criterion one could deny that Tib is\na cat. Yet they are distinct individuals, since they have different\nhistories. But there is just one cat on the mat. So they cannot be\ndistinct cats. They must be the same cat, even though they are\ndistinct individuals; and so identity under the sortal concept\ncat must be a relative identity relation. \n\nThe second version (presented in Geach 1980, compare Unger 1980)\ngoes as follows. Tibbles is sitting on the mat and is the only cat\nsitting on the mat. But Tibbles has at least 1,000 hairs. Geach\ncontinues: “Now let c be the largest continuous mass of\nfeline tissue on the mat. Then for any of our 1,000 hairs, say\nhn, there is a proper part\ncn of c which contains precisely\nall of c except that hair hn; and\nevery such part cn differs in a\ndescribable way both from any other such part say\ncm, and from c as a whole.\nMoreover, fuzzy as the concept cat may be, it is clear that\nnot only is c a cat, but also any part\ncn is a cat:\ncn would clearly be a cat were the hair\nhn to be plucked out, and we cannot\nreasonably suppose that plucking out a hair generates a cat,\nso cn must already have been a\ncat.” \n\nThe conclusion, of course, is the same as in the previous version of\nthe argument: there is only one cat on the mat so all the distinct\nentities that qualify as cats must be the same cat. \n\nThis version of the argument can be resisted by insisting that the\nconcept of a cat is maximal, i.e. no proper part of a cat is a\ncat. The first version may be resisted in a variety of ways. Some deny\nthe existence of the tail-complement at all (van Inwagen 1981, Olson\n1995); others deny that the tail-complement survives the amputation\n(Burke 1995). Another possibility is to say that certain of the\nhistorical and/or modal predicates possessed by Tibbles and not Tib\nare essential to being a cat, so that Tib is not (predicatively) a cat\n(Wiggins 1980). Again, it can be accepted that both Tib and Tibbles\nare cats, but deny that in counting them as one we are counting by\nidentity, rather, we are counting by “almost identity”\n(Lewis 1993). Another possibility is to accept that both Tib and\nTibbles are cats, but deny that they are distinct: rather\n“Tib” and “Tibbles” are two names of the same\ncat-stage (Hawley 2001, Sider 2001). \n\n\nThere is, then, no very compelling argument for Geach’s sortal\nrelativity thesis to be based on such examples, given the variety of\nresponses available, some of which will be returned to below. On the\nother hand, no alternative solution to the puzzle of the cat on the\nmat stands out as clearly superior to the rest, or clearly superior to\nthe sortal relativity thesis as a solution. We should conclude that\nthis component of Geach’s position, though not proven, is not refuted\neither, and, possibly, that the linguistic data provide no basis for a\ndecision for or against. \n\nA notion that Geach deploys extensively, and which is also in common\nuse by his opponents, is that of a criterion of identity, a standard by\nwhich identity is to be judged. This section will attempt to untangle\nsome of the complexities this notion involves. \n\nThe notion of a criterion of identity was introduced into\nphilosophical terminology by Frege (1884) and strongly emphasised by\nWittgenstein (1958). Exactly how it is to be interpreted and the extent\nof its applicability are still matters of debate. \n\nA considerable obstacle to understanding contemporary philosophical\nusage of the term, however, is that the notion does not seem to be a\nunitary one. In the case of abstract objects (the case discussed by\nFrege) the criterion of identity for Fs is thought of as an\nequivalence relation holding between objects distinct from Fs.\nThus the criterion of identity for directions is parallelism of\nlines, that is, the direction of line a is identical\nwith the direction of line b if and only if line a\nis parallel to line b. The criterion of identity for numbers\nis equinumerosity of concepts, that is, the number\nof As is identical with the number of Bs if and only\nif there are exactly as many As as Bs. The relation\nbetween the criterion of identity for Fs and the criterion of\napplication for the concept F (the standard for the\napplication of the concept to an individual) is then said by some\n(Wright and Hale 2001) to be that to be an F is just to be\nsomething for which questions of identity and distinctness are to\nsettled by appeal to the criterion of identity for Fs. (Thus,\nwhen Frege went on to give an explicit definition of numbers as\nextensions of concepts he appealed to it only to deduce what has come\nto be called Hume’s Principle – his statement of his\ncriterion of identity for numbers in terms of equinumerosity of\nconcepts, and emphasised that he regarded the appeal to extensions as\ninessential.)  In the case of concrete objects, however, things seem\nto stand differently. Often the criterion of identity for a concrete\nobject of type F is said to be a relation R such\nthat for any\nFs, x and y, x=y if and\nonly if Rxy. In this case the criterion of identity for\nFs is not stated as a relation between entities distinct from\nFs and the criterion of identity cannot plausibly be thought\nof as determining the criterion of application. Another example of the\nlack of uniformity in the notion of a criterion of identity\nin contemporary philosophy is, in the case of concrete objects, a\ndistinction customarily made between a criterion of diachronic identity\nand a criterion of synchronic identity; the former taking the form\n“x is at t the same F as y is\nat t′ if and only if…”, where what fills\nthe gap is some statement of a relation holding between objects\nx and y and times t and t′.\n(In the case of persons, for example, a candidate criterion of\ndiachronic identity is: x is at t the same person as\ny is at t′ if and only if x at\nt is psychologically continuous with y at\nt′.) A criterion of synchronic identity, by contrast,\nwill typically specify how the parts of an F-thing existing at\na time must be related, or how one F at a time is marked off\nfrom another. \n\nOne way of bringing system into the discussion of criteria of identity\nis to make use of the distinction between one-level and two-level\ncriteria of identity (Williamson 1990, Lowe 2012). The Fregean\ncriteria of identity for directions and numbers are two-level. The\nobjects for which the criterion is given are distinct from, and can be\npictured as at a higher level than, the entities between which the\nrelation specified holds. A two-level criterion for the Fs\ntakes the form (restricting ourselves to examples in which the\ncriterial relation holds between objects): \ne.g., If x and y are lines then the direction\nof x is identical with the direction of y\niff x and y are parallel. \n\nA two-level criterion of identity is thus in the first place an\nimpliicit definition of a function “d( )”\n(e.g., “the direction of”) in terms of which the sortal\npredicate “is an F” can be defined (“is a\ndirection” can be defined as “is the direction of some\nline”). Consistently with the two-level criterion of identity\nstated several distinct functions may be the reference of the functor\n“d”. Hence, as emphasised by Lowe (1997: section 6),\ntwo-level criteria of identity are neither definitions of identity,\nnor of identity restricted to a certain sort (for identity is\nuniversal), nor even of the sortal terms denoting the sorts for which\nthey provide criteria. They merely constrain, but not to uniqueness,\nthe possible referents of the functor “d” they implicitly\ndefine and they thus give a merely necessary condition for falling\nunder the sortal predicate “is an F” (where\n“x is an F” is explained to mean\n“for some y, x is identical with\nd(y)”). \n\nOn the other hand, the criterion of identity for sets given by the\nAxiom of Extensionality (sets are the same iff they have the same\nmembers), unlike the criterion of identity for numbers given by Hume’s\nPrinciple, and Davidson’s criterion of event identity (events are the\nsame iff they have the same causes and effects (“The\nIndividuation of Events” in his 1980)) are one-level: the\nobjects for which the criterion of identity is stated are the same as\nthose between which the criterial relation obtains. In general, a\none-level criterion for objects of sort F takes the form: \n\nNot all criteria of identity can be two-level (on pain of infinite\nregress), and it is tempting to think that the distinction between\nobjects for which a two-level criterion is possible and those for\nwhich only a one-level criterion is possible coincides with that\nbetween abstract and concrete objects (and so, that a two-level\ncriterion for sets must be possible). \n\nHowever, a more general application of the two-level notion is\npossible. In fact, it can be applied to any type of object K,\nsuch that the criterion of identity for\nKs can be thought of as an equivalence relation between a\ndistinct type of object, K*s, but some such objects may\nintuitively be regarded as concrete. \n\nHow general this makes its application is a matter of controversy.\nIn particular, if persisting things are thought of as composed of\n(instantaneous) temporal parts (see discussion below), the problem of\nsupplying a diachronic criterion of identity for persisting concrete objects can\nbe regarded as the problem of providing a two-level criterion. But if\npersisting things are not thought of in this way then not all\npersisting things can be provided with two-level criteria. (Though some\ncan. For example, it is quite plausible that the criterion of identity\nover time for persons should be thought of as given by a relation\nbetween bodies.) \n\nAs noted by Lowe (1997) and Wright and Hale (2001) any two-level\ncriterion can be restated in a one-level form (though, of course, not\nconversely). For example, to say that the direction of line a\nis identical with the direction of line b if and only if\nline a is parallel to line b is to say that\ndirections are the same if and only if the lines they are of are\nparallel, which is the form of a one-level criterion. A way of\nunifying the various different ways of talking of criteria of identity\nis thus to take as the paradigmatic form of a statement of a criterion\nof identity a statement of the form: for any x, for any\ny, if x is an F and y is an\nF then x=y if and only if Rxy (Lowe\n1989, 1997). \n\nIf the notion is interpreted in this way then the relation between\nthe criterion of identity and the criterion of application will be that\nof one-way determination. The criterion of identity will be determined\nby, but not determine, the criterion of application. \n\nFor, in general, a one-level criterion of identity for Fs as\nexplained above is equivalent to the conjunction of: Each of these gives a merely necessary condition for being\nan F. And the second says something about Fs which\nis not true of everything only if “Rxy” does not\nentail “x=y” \n\nTogether these are equivalent to the proposition that every F\nis the F “R-related” to it. By its form this\nstates a merely necessary conditon for being a thing of sort\n“F”. The one-level criterion of identity thus again merely\nspecifies a necessary condition of being an object of sort\n“F”. \n\nHence, once the necessary and sufficient conditons of being an\n“F” are laid down, no further stipulation is\nrequired of a criterion of “F”-identity, whether\none-level or two-level. \n\nThis conclusion is, of course, in agreement with Lewis’s view that\nthere are no genuine problems about identity as such (Lewis 1986, Ch.\n4), but it is in tension with the thought that sortal concepts, as\ndistinct from adjectival concepts, are to be characterised by their\ninvolvement of criteria of identity as well as criteria of\napplication. \n\nA conception of identity criteria which allows this characterisation\nof the notion of a sortal concept, and which has so far not been\nmentioned, is that of Dummett (1981). Dummett denies that a criterion\nof identity must always be regarded as a criterion of identity for a\ntype of object. There is a basic level, he suggests, at which\nwhat a criterion of identity is a criterion of, is the truth of a\nstatement in which no objects are referred to. Such a\nstatement can be expressed using demonstratives and pointing gestures,\nfor instance, by saying “This is the same cat as that”,\npointing first to a head and then a tail. In such a statement, which he\ncalls a statement of identification, in Dummett’s view, there need be\nno reference to objects made by the use of the demonstratives, any more\nthan reference is made to any object in a feature-placing sentence like\n“It’s hot here”. A statement of identification is merely,\nas it were, a feature-placing relational statement, like “This is\ndarker than that”. A grasp of a sortal concept F\ninvolves both grasp of the truth-conditions of such statements of\nidentification involving “F” and also grasp of the\ntruth-conditions of what Dummett calls “crude predications”\ninvolving “F”, statements of the form “this\nis F”, in which the demonstrative again does not serve\nto refer to any object. Adjectival terms, which have only a criterion\nof application and no criterion of identity, are ones which have a use\nin such crude predications, but no use in statements of identification.\nSortal terms, as just noted, have a use in both contexts, and sortal\nterms may share their criteria of application but differ in their\ncriteria of identity since grasp of the truth-conditions of the crude\npredication “This is F” does not determine grasp\nof the truth-conditions of the statement of identification “This\nis the same F as that” (thus I can know when it is right\nto say “This is a book” without knowing when it is right to\nsay “This is the same book as that”). \n\nOn Dummett’s account, then, it may be possible to accept that whenever\na criterion of identity for a type of object is to be given\nit must be (expressible as) a two-level criterion, which implicity\ndefines a functor. Essentially one-level criteria (one-level criteria\nnot expressible in a two-level form) are redundant, determined by\nspecifications of necessary and sufficient conditions for being\nobjects of the sorts in question. \n\nAs noted in the last section, another source of apparent disunity in\nthe concept of a criterion of identity is the distinction made between\nsynchronic criteria of identity and diachronic criteria of\nidentity. Criteria of identity can be employed synchronically, as in\nthe examples just given, to determine whether two coexistent objects\nare parts of the same object of a sort, or diachronically, to\ndetermine identity over time. But as Lowe notes (2012: 137), it is an\nerror to suppose that diachronic identity and synchronic identity are\ndifferent kinds of identity and so demand different kinds of identity\ncriteria. What then is a criterion of identity over time? \n\nIdentity over time is itself a controversial notion, however, because\ntime involves change. Heraclitus argued that one could not bathe in\nthe same river twice because new waters were ever flowing in. Hume\nargued that identity over time was a fiction we substitute for a\ncollection of related objects. Such views can be seen as based on a\nmisunderstanding of Leibniz’s Law: if a thing changes something is\ntrue of it at the later time that is not true of it at the earlier, so\nit is not the same. The answer is that what is true of it at the later\ntime is, say, “being muddy at the later time”, which was\nalways true of it; similarly, what is true of it at the earlier time,\nsuitably expressed, remains true of it. But the question remains how\nto characterise identity through time and across change given that\nthere is such a thing. \n\nOne topic which has always loomed large in this debate has been the\nissue (in the terminology of Lewis 1986, Ch. 4) of perdurance\nversus endurance. (Others, for which there is no space for\ndiscussion here, include the debate over Ship of Theseus and\nreduplication or fission problems and associated issues about\n“best candidate” or “no rival candidate”\naccounts of identity over time, and the debate over Humean\nsupervenience – see articles on relative identity, personal\nidentity, Hawley 2001 and Sider 2001.) \n\nAccording to one view, material objects persist by having\ntemporal parts or stages, which exist at different times and\nare to be distinguished by the times at which they exist – this\nis known as the view that material objects perdure. Other philosophers\ndeny that this is so; according to them, when a material object exists\nat different times, it is wholly present at those times, for it has no\ntemporal parts, but only spatial parts, which likewise are wholly\npresent at the different times they exist. This is known as the view\nthat material objects endure. \n\nPerdurance theorists, as Quine puts it, reject the point of view\ninherent in the tenses of our natural language. From that point of view\npersisting things endure and change through time, but do not\nextend through time, but only through space. Thus persisting\nthings are to be sharply distinguished from events or processes, which\nprecisely do extend through time. One way of describing the position of\nthe perdurance theorist, then, is to say that he denies the existence\nof a distinct ontological category of persisting things, or\nsubstances. Thus, Quine writes, “physical objects, conceived thus\nfour-dimensionally in space-time, are not to be distinguished from\nevents, or, in the concrete sense of the term, processes. Each\ncomprises simply the content, however heterogeneous, of some portion of\nspace-time, however disconnected and gerrymandered”\n(1960:171). \n\nIn recent controversy two arguments have been at the centre of the\nendurance/perdurance debate, one employed by perdurance theorists and\nthe other by endurance theorists (for other arguments and issues see\nthe separate article on temporal parts, Hawley 2001 and Sider\n2001). \n\nAn argument for perdurance which has been hotly debated is due to\nDavid Lewis (1986). If perdurance is rejected, the ascription of dated\nor tensed properties to objects must be regarded as assertions of\nirreducible relations between objects and times.  If Tabby is\nfat on Monday, that is a relation between Tabby and Monday, and if\nperdurance is rejected it is an irreducible relation between Tabby and\nMonday. According to perdurance theory, however, while it is still, of\ncourse, a relation between Tabby and Monday it is not irrreducible; it\nholds between Tabby and Monday because the temporal part of Tabby on\nMonday, Tabby-on-Monday, is intrinsically fat. If perdurance is\nrejected, however, no such intrinsic possessor of the property of\nfatness can be recognised: Tabby’s fatness on Monday must be regarded\nas an irreducible state of affairs. \n\nAccording to Lewis, this consequence of the rejection of the\nperdurance theory is incredible. Whether he is right about this is the\nsubject of intense debate (Haslanger 2003). \n\nEven if Lewis is right, however, the perdurance theory may still be\nfound wanting, since it does not secure the most commonsensical\nposition: that fatness is a property of a cat (Haslanger\n2003). According to perdurance theory, rather, it is a property of a\n(temporal) cat part. Those known as stage theorists (Hawley 2001, Sider\n2001), accepting the ontology of perdurance theory, but modifying its\nsemantics, offer a way to secure this desirable result. Every temporal\npart of a cat is a cat, they say, so Tabby-on-Monday (which is\nwhat we refer to by “Tabby”, on Monday) is a cat and is\nfat, just as we would like. Stage theorists have to pay a price for\nthis advantage over perdurance theory, however. For they must accept\neither that our reports of the cross-temporal number of cats\nare not always reports of the counting of cats (as when I say, truly,\nthat I have only ever owned three cats) or that two cat-stages\n(cats) may be counted as one and the same cat, so that counting cats is\nnot always counting in accordance with absolute identity. \n\nAn argument against the perdurance theory that has been\nthe focus of interest is one presented in various guises by a\nnumber of writers, including Wiggins (1980), Thomson (1983) and van\nInwagen (1990). Applied to persons (it can equally well be applied to\nother persisting things), it asserts that persons have different\nproperties, in particular, different modal properties, from the\nsummations of person-stages with which the perdurance theory identifies\nthem. Thus, by Leibniz’s Law, this identification must be mistaken. As\nDavid Wiggins states the argument: “Anything that is a part of a\nLesniewskian sum [a mereological whole defined by its parts] is\nnecessarily part of it…But no person or normal material object\nis necessarily in the total state that will correspond to the\nperson- or object-moment postulated by the theory under\ndiscussion” (1980: 168). \n\nTo elaborate a little. I might have died when I was five years old.\nBut that maximal summation of person-stages which, according to\nperdurance theory, is me and has a temporal extent of at least\nfifty years, could not have had a temporal extent of a mere five years.\nSo I cannot be such a summation of stages. \n\nThis argument illustrates the interdependence of the various topics\ndiscussed under the rubric of identity. Whether it is valid, of course,\ndepends on the correct analysis of modal predication, and, in\nparticular, on whether it should be analysed in terms of\n“identity across possible worlds” or in terms of Lewisean\ncounterpart theory. This is the topic of the next section. \n\nIn the interpretation of modal discourse recourse is often made to\nthe idea of “identity across possible worlds”. If modal\ndiscourse is interpreted in this way it becomes natural to regard a\nstatement ascribing a modal property to an individual as asserting the\nidentity of that individual across worlds: “John might have been\na millionaire”, on this view, asserts that there is a possible\nworld in which an individual identical with John is a millionaire.\n“John could not have been a millionaire” asserts that in\nany world in which an individual identical with John exists that\nindividual is not a millionaire. \n\nHowever, though this is perhaps the most natural way to interpret\nde re modal statements (once it has been accepted that the\napparatus of possible worlds is to be used as an interpretative tool),\nthere are well-known difficulties that make the approach\nproblematic. \n\nFor example, it seems reasonable to suppose that a complex artefact\nlike a bicycle could have been made of different parts. On the other\nhand, it does not seem right that the same bicycle could have been\nconstructed out of completely different parts. \n\nBut now consider a series of possible worlds, beginning with the\nactual world, each containing a bicycle just slightly different from\nthe one in the previous world, the last world in the sequence being one\nin which there is a bicycle composed of completely different parts from\nthe one in the actual world. One cannot say that each bicycle is\nidentical with the one in the neighbouring world, but not identical\nwith the corresponding bicycle in distant worlds, since identity is\ntransitive. Hence it seems one must either adopt an extreme\nmereological essentialism, according to which no difference of parts is\npossible for an individual, or reject the interpretation of de\nre modal discourse as asserting identity across possible\nworlds. \n\nThis and other problems with cross-world identity suggest that some\nother weaker relation, of similarity or what David Lewis calls\ncounterparthood, should be employed in a possible world analysis of\nmodal discourse. Since similarity is not transitive this allows us to\nsay that the bicycle might have had some different parts without having\nto say that it might have been wholly different. On the other hand,\nsuch a substitution does not seem unproblematic, for a claim about what\nI might have done hardly seems, at first sight, to be\ncorrectly interpretable as a claim about what someone else\n(however similar to me) does in another possible world (Kripke 1972\n[1980], note 13). \n\nAn assessment of the counterpart theoretic analysis is vital not\njust to understanding modal discourse, however, but also to getting to\nthe correct account of identity over time. For, as we saw,\nthe argument against perdurance theory outlined at the end of the last\nsection depends on the correct interpretation of modal discourse. In\nfact, it is invalid on a counterpart theoretic analysis which allows\ndifferent counterpart relations (different similarity relations) to be\ninvoked according to the sense of the singular term which is the\nsubject of the de re modal predication (Lewis 1986, Ch. 4),\nsince the counterpart relation relevant to the assessment of a de\nre modal predication with a singular term whose sense determines\nthat it refers to a person will be different from that relevant to the\nassessment of a de re modal predication with a singular term\nwhose sense determines that it refers to a sum of person-stages.\n“I might have existed for only five years” means on the\nLewisean account “There is a person in some possible world\nsimilar to me in those respects important to personhood who exists for\nonly five years”; “The maximal summation of person stages\nof which this current stage is a stage might have existed for only five\nyears” means “There is a summation of person stages similar\nto this one in those respects important to the status of an entity as a\nsummation of stages which exists for only five years”. Since the\ntwo similarity relations in question are distinct the first modal\nstatement may be true and the second false even if I am identical with\nthe sum of stages in question. \n\nCounterpart theory is also significant to the topic of identity over\ntime in another way, since it provides the analogy to which the stage\ntheorist (who regards all everyday reference as reference to momentary\nstages rather than to perdurers) appeals to explain de re\ntemporal predication. Thus, according to the stage theorist, just as\n“I might have been fat” does not require the existence of a\npossible world in which an object identical with me is fat, but only\nthe existence of a world in which a (modal) counterpart of me is fat,\nso “I used to be fat” does not require the existence of a\npast time at which someone identical with (the present momentary stage\nwhich is) me was fat, but only the existence of a past time at which a\n(temporal) counterpart of me was fat. The problem of identity over time\nfor things of a kind, for stage theorists, is just the problem of\ncharacterizing the appropriate temporal counterpart relation for things\nof that kind. \n\nFor a more detailed discussion of the topic,\nsee the entry \n  transworld identity.\n Whether de re modal discourse is to be interpreted in terms\nof identity across possible worlds or counterpart theoretically (or in\nsome other way entirely) is also relevant to our next topic, that of\ncontingent identity.    \n\nBefore Kripke’s writings (1972 [1980]), it seemed a platitude that\nstatements of identity could be contingent – when they contained\ntwo terms differing in sense but identical in reference and so were not\nanalytic. Kripke challenged this platitude, though, of course, he did\nnot reject the possibility of contingent statements of identity. But he\nargued that when the terms flanking the sign of identity were what he\ncalled rigid designators, an identity statement, if true at all, had to\nbe necessarily true, but need not be knowable a priori, as an\nanalytic truth would be. Connectedly, Kripke argued that identity and\ndistinctness were themselves necessary relations: if an object is\nidentical with itself it is necessarily so, and if it is distinct from\nanother it is necessarily so. \n\nKripke’s arguments were very persuasive, but there are examples that\nsuggest that his conclusion is too sweeping – that even identity\nstatements containing rigid designators can be, in a sense, contingent.\nThe debate over contingent identity is concerned with the assessment\nand proper analysis of these examples. \n\nOne of the earliest examples is provided by Gibbard (1975). Consider\na statue, Goliath, and the clay, Lumpl, from which it is composed.\nImagine that Lumpl and Goliath coincide in their spatiotemporal extent.\nIt is tempting to conclude that they are identical. But they might not\nhave been. Goliath might have been rolled into a ball and destroyed;\nLumpl would have continued to exist. The two would have been distinct.\nThus it seems that the identity of Lumpl and Goliath, if admitted, must\nbe acknowledged as merely contingent. \n\nOne reaction to this argument available to the convinced Kripkean is\nsimply to deny that Lumpl and Goliath are identical. But to accept\nthis is to accept that purely material entities, like statues and\nlumps of clay, of admittedly identical material constitution at all\ntimes, may nonetheless be distinct, though distinguished only by\nmodal, dispositional or counterfactual properties. To many, however,\nthis seems highly implausible, which provides the strength of the\nargument for contingent identity. Another way of thinking of this\nmatter is in terms of the failure of the supervenience of the\nmacroscopic on the microscopic. If Lumpl is distinct from Goliath then\na far distant duplicate of Lumpl, Lumpl*, coincident with a statue\nGoliath*, though numerically distinct from Goliath will\nbe microscopically indistinguishable from Goliath\nin all general respects, relational as well as\nnon-relational, past and future as well as present, even modal and\ndispositional as well as categorical, but will\nbe macroscopically distinguishable in general respects, since\nit will not be a statue, and will have modal properties, such as the\ncapacity to survive radical deformation in shape, which no statue\npossesses. \n\nDavid Lewis (in “Counterparts of Persons and their\nBodies”, 1971) suggests that the identity of a person with his\nbody (assuming the person and the body, like Goliath and Lumpl, are at\nall times coincident) is contingent, since bodily interchange is a\npossibility. He appeals to counterpart theory, modified to allow a\nvariety of counterpart relations, to explain this. Contingent identity\nthen makes sense, since “I and my body might not have been\nidentical” now translates into counterpart theory as\n“There is a possible world, w, a unique personal\ncounterpart\nx in w of me and a unique bodily counterpart\ny in w of my body, such that x and y\nare not identical”. \n\nWhat is crucial to making sense of contingent identity is an\nacceptance that modal predicates are inconstant in denotation (that\nis, stand for different properties when attached to different singular\nterms or different quantifying expressions). Counterpart theory\nprovides one way of explaining this inconstancy, but is not\nnecessarily the only way (Gibbard 1975, Noonan 1991, 1993). However,\nwhether the examples of contingent identity in the literature are\npersuasive enough to make it reasonable to accept the certainly\ninitially surprising idea that modal predications are inconstant in\ndenotation is still a matter of considerable controversy. \n\nFinally, in this section, it is worth noting explicitly the\ninterdependence of the topics under discussion: only if the possibility\nof contingent identity is secured, by counterpart theory or some other\naccount of de re modality which does not straightforwardly\nanalyse de re modal predication in terms of identity across\npossible worlds, can perdurance theory (or stage theory) as an account\nof identity across time be sustained against the modal arguments of\nWiggins, Thomson and van Inwagen. \n\nA thesis that has a long pedigree but has only recently been gathering\nattention in the contemporary literature is the “Composition as\nIdentity” thesis. The thesis comes in a weak and a strong\nform. In its weak form the thesis is that the mereological composition\nrelation is analogous in a number of important ways to the identity\nrelation and so deserves to be called a kind of identity. In\nits strong form the thesis is that the composition relation is\nstrictly identical with the identity relation, viz. that the parts of\na whole are literally (collectively) identical with the whole\nitself. The strong thesis was considered by Plato in\nParmenides and versions of the thesis have been discussed by\nmany historical figures since (Harte 2002, Normore and Brown\n2014). The progenitor of the modern version of the thesis is Baxter\n(1988a, 1988b, 2001) but it is most often discussed under the\nformulation of it given by Lewis (1991), who first considers the\nstrong thesis before rejecting it in favour of the weak thesis.  Both the strong and the weak versions of the thesis are motivated\nby the fact that there is an especially intimate relation between a\nwhole and its parts (a whole is “nothing over and above”\nits parts), buttressed by claims that identity and composition are\nalike in various ways. Lewis (1991: 85) makes five likeness\nclaims: \n\nClearly not all will agree with each of Lewis’s likeness\nclaims. Anyone who denies unrestricted mereological composition, for\nexample, will deny 2. And the defender of strong pluralism in the\nmaterial constitution debate (i.e. one who defends the view that there\ncan be all-time coincident entities) will deny 3. And some\nendurantists who think that ordinary material objects can have\ndistinct parts at distinct times will deny 5. But there is a more\ngeneral problem with 1, as van Inwagen has made clear (1994:\n213). Consider a world w1 that contains just two simples s1 and\ns2. Now consider the difference between someone p1 who believes that\ns1 and s2 compose something and someone p2 who does not. Ask: how many\nobjects do p1 and p2 believe there to be in w1? The answer, it seems,\nis that p1 believes that there are three things and p2 only two. So\nhow can a commitment to the existence of fusions be ontologically\ninnocent? One recent suggestion is that although a commitment to the\nexistence of fusions is not ontologically innocent, it almost\nis: to commit oneself to fusions is to commit oneself to further\nentities, but because they are not fundamental entities they are not\nones that matter for the purpose of theory choice (Cameron 2014,\nSchaffer 2008, Williams 2010, and see also Hawley 2014). \n\nIf one believes Lewis’s likeness claims one will be tempted by at\nleast the weak Composition as Identity thesis. If composition is a\ntype of identity this gives some kind of explanation of why the\nparallels between the two hold. But the strong thesis, that the\ncomposition relation is the identity relation, gives a fuller\nexplanation. So why not hold the strong thesis? Because, many think,\nthere are additional challenges that face anyone who wishes to defend\nthe strong thesis.  The classical identity relation is one that can only have single\nobjects as relata (as in: “George Orwell = Eric\nBlair”). If we adopt a language that allows the formation of\nplural terms we can unproblematically define a plural identity\nrelation that holds between pluralities of objects too. Plural\nidentity statements such as “the hunters are identical with the\ngatherers” are understood to mean that for all x,\nx is one of the hunters iff x is one of the\ngatherers. But, according to the strong Composition as Identity\nthesis, there can also be true hybrid identity statements that relate\npluralities and single objects. That is, sentences such as “the\nbricks = the wall” are taken by the defender of strong\nComposition as Identity to be well-formed sentences that express\nstrict identities. The first challenge facing the defender of the strong thesis is the\nleast troublesome. It is the syntactic problem that hybrid identity\nstatements are ungrammatical in English (Van Inwagen, 1994:\n211). Whilst “George Orwell is identical with Eric Blair”\nand “the hunters are identical with the gatherers” are\nwell-formed, it seems that “the bricks are identical with the\nwall” is not. However, there is in fact some doubt about whether\nhybrid identity statements are ungrammatical in English, and some have\npointed out that this is anyway a mere grammatical artefact of English\nthat is not present in other languages (e.g. Norwegian and\nHungarian). So it seems that the most this challenge calls for is a\nmild form of grammatical revisionism. And we have, at any rate, formal\nlanguages that allow hybrid constructions to be made in which to\nexpress the claims made by the defender of the strong Composition as\nIdentity thesis. (Sider 2007, Cotnoir 2013) (NB The claims regarding\nNorwegian and Hungarian are to be found in these two papers.)  The second challenge is more troublesome. It is the semantic\nproblem of providing coherent truth-conditions for hybrid identity\nstatements. The standard way to provide the truth-conditions for the\nclassical identity relation is to say that an identity statement of\nthe form “a=b” is true iff\n“a” and “b” have the same\nreferents. But this account clearly does not work for hybrid identity\nstatements, for there is no (single) referent for a plural\nterm. Moreover, the standard way of giving the truth-conditions for\nplural identity statements (mentioned above) does not work for hybrid\nidentity statements either. To say that “x is one of\nthe ys” is to say that x is (classically)\nidentical with one of the things in the plurality, i.e., that x\nis identical with\ny1, or identical with y2…\nor identical with yn. But then “the\nbricks = the wall” is true only if the wall is (classically)\nidentical with one of the bricks, i.e. with b1, or\nwith b2… or with bn,\nwhich it isn’t.  The third challenge is the most troublesome of all. In section 2\nit was noted that Leibniz’s Law (and its contrapositive) appear to be\ncrucial to our understanding of identity and distinctness. But it\nseems that the defender of strong Composition as Identity must deny\nthis. After all, the bricks are many, but the wall is one. The onus is\nthus on the defender of strong Composition as Identity to explain why\nwe should think the “are” in hybrid identity statements\nreally expresses the relation of identity. \n\nThe second and the third challenges have been thought by many to be\ninsurmountable (Lewis, for example, rejects strong Composition as\nIdentity on the basis of them). But, in recent semantic work in this\narea, accounts have emerged that promise to answer both\nchallenges. (Wallace 2011a, 2011b, Cotnoir 2013). Whether they do so,\nhowever, remains to be seen. Like the impossibility of contingent identity, the impossibility of\nvague identity appears to be a straightforward consequence of the\nclassical concept of identity (Evans 1978, see also Salmon 1982). For\nif a is only vaguely identical with b, something is\ntrue of it – that it is only vaguely identical with b\n– that is not true of b, so, by Leibniz’s Law, it is not\nidentical with b at all. Of course, there are vague statements\nof identity – “Princeton is Princeton Borough” (Lewis\n1988) – but the conclusion appears to follow that such vagueness\nis only possible when one or both of the terms flanking the sign of\nidentity is an imprecise designator. Relatedly, it appears to follow\nthat identity itself must be a determinate relation. \n\nBut some examples suggest that this conclusion is too sweeping\n– that even identity statements containing precise designators\nmay be, in some sense, indeterminate. Consider Everest and some\nprecisely defined hunk of rock, ice and snow, Rock, of which it is\nindeterminate whether its boundaries coincide with those of Everest. It\nis tempting to think that “Everest” and “Rock”\nare both precise designators (if “Everest” is not, is\nanything? (Tye 2000)) and that “Everest is Rock” is\nnonetheless in some sense indeterminate. \n\nThose who take this view have to respond to Evans’s original argument,\nabout which there has been intense debate (see separate article on\nvagueness, Edgington 2000, Lewis 1988, Parsons 2000, van Inwagen 1990,\nWilliamson 2002 and 2003), but also to more recent variants. There is\nno space to go into these matters here, but one particular variant of\nthe Evans argument worth briefly noting is given by Hawley\n(2001). Alpha and Omega are (two?) people, the first of whom steps\ninto van Inwagen’s (1990) fiendish cabinet which disrupts whatever\nfeatures are relevant to personal identity, and the second of whom\nthen steps out: \n\n(2) Alpha is such that it is indeterminate whether she steps out of\nthe cabinet \n\n(3) It is not indeterminate whether Omega steps out of the\ncabinet \n\n(4) Omega is not such that it is indeterminate whether she steps out\nof the cabinet \n\n(5) Alpha is not identical to Omega. \n\nThis argument differs from the standard version of Evans’s argument\nby not depending upon identity-involving properties (e.g. being such\nthat it is indeterminate whether she is Omega) to establish\ndistinctness, and this removes some sources of controversy. Others, of\ncourse, remain. \n\nThe debate over vague identity is too vast to survey here, but to\nfinish we can relate this debate to the previously discussed debate\nabout identity over time. \n\nFor some putative cases of vagueness in synchronic identity it seems\nreasonable to accept the conclusion of Evans’s argument and locate the\nindeterminacy in language (see the “Reply” by Shoemaker in\nShoemaker and Swinburne 1984 for the following example). A structure\nconsists of two halls, Alpha Hall and Beta Hall, linked by a flimsy\nwalkway, Smith is located in Alpha Hall, Jones in Beta Hall. The nature\nof the structure is such that the identity statement “The\nbuilding in which Smith is located is the building in which Jones is\nlocated” is neither true nor false because it is indeterminate\nwhether Alpha Hall and Beta Hall count as two distinct buildings or\nmerely as two parts of one and the same building. Here it is absolutely\nclear what is going on. The term “building” is vague in a\nway that makes it indeterminate whether it applies to the whole\nstructure or just to the two halls. Consequently, it is indeterminate\nwhat “the building in which Smith is located” and\n“the building in which Jones is located” denote. \n\nPerdurance theorists, who assimilate identity over time to identity\nover space, can accommodate vagueness in identity over time in the same\nway. In Hawley’s example they can say that there are several entities\npresent: one that exists before and after the identity-obscuring\noccurrences in the cabinet, one that exists only before, and one that\nexists only after. It is indeterminate which of these is a person and\nso it is indeterminate what the singular terms “Alpha” and\n“Omega” refer to. \n\nThis involves taking on an ontology that is larger than we\nordinarily recognise, but that is not uncongenial to the perdurance\ntheorist, who is happy to regard any, however spatiotemporally\ndisconnected, region as containing a physical object (Quine\n1960:171). \n\nBut what of endurance theorists? \n\nOne option for them is to adopt the same response and to accept a\nmultiplicity of entities partially coinciding in space and time where\nto common sense there seems to be only one. But this is to give up on\none of the major advantages claimed by the endurance theorist, his\nconsonance with common sense. \n\nThe endurance theorist has several other options. He may simply deny\nthe existence of the relevant entities and restrict his ontology to\nentities which are not complex; he may insist that any change destroys\nidentity so that in a strict and philosophical sense Alpha is distinct\nfrom Omega; or he may reject the case as one of vagueness, insisting\nthat, though we do not know the answer, either Alpha is Omega or she is\nnot. \n\nHowever, the most tempting option for the endurance theorist, which\nkeeps closest to common sense, is to accept that the case is one of\nvagueness, deny the multiplicity of entities embraced by the perdurance\ntheorist and reject Evans’s argument against vague identity. \n\nThat this is so highlights the fact that there is no easy solution\nto the problem consonant in every respect with common sense. Locating\nthe vagueness in language requires us to acknowledge a multiplicity of\nentities of which we would apparently otherwise have to take no notice.\nWhilst locating it in the world requires an explanation of how,\ncontrary to Evans’s argument, the impossibility of vague identity is\nnot a straightforward consequence of the classical conception of\nidentity, or else the abandonment of that conception.","contact.mail":"Harold.Noonan@nottingham.ac.uk","contact.domain":"nottingham.ac.uk"},{"date.published":"2004-12-15","date.changed":"2018-05-25","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity/","author1":"Harold Noonan","author1.info":"http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/philosophy/staff/harold-noonan.php","author2.info":"https://www.ntu.ac.uk/staff-profiles/education/benjamin-curtis","entry":"identity","body.text":"\n\n\n\nMuch of the debate about identity in recent decades has been about\npersonal identity, and specifically about personal identity over time,\nbut identity generally, and the identity of things of other kinds,\nhave also attracted attention. Various interrelated problems have been\nat the centre of discussion, but it is fair to say that recent work\nhas focussed particularly on the following areas: the notion of a\ncriterion of identity; the correct analysis of identity over time,\nand, in particular, the disagreement between advocates of perdurance\nand advocates of endurance as analyses of identity over time; the\nnotion of identity across possible worlds and the question of its\nrelevance to the correct analysis of de re modal discourse;\nthe notion of contingent identity; the question of whether the\nidentity relation is, or is similar to, the composition relation; and\nthe notion of vague identity. A radical position, advocated by Peter\nGeach, is that these debates, as usually conducted, are void for lack\nof a subject matter: the notion of\nabsolute identity they presuppose has no application; there\nis only relative identity. Another increasingly popular view\nis the one advocated by Lewis: although the debates make sense they\ncannot genuinely be debates about identity, since there are no\nphilosophical problems about identity. Identity is an utterly\nunproblematic notion.  What there are, are genuine problems which can\nbe stated using the language of identity. But since these can be\nrestated without the language of identity they are not problems about\nidentity. (For example, it is a puzzle, an aspect of the so-called\n“problem of personal identity”, whether the same\nperson can have different bodies at different times. But this is just\nthe puzzle whether a person can have different bodies at\ndifferent times.  So since it can be stated without the language of\npersonal “identity”, it is not a problem about\npersonal identity, but about personhood.) This article\nprovides an overview of the topics indicated above, some assessment of\nthe debates and suggestions for further reading.\n\n\n\nTo say that things are identical is to say that they are the same.\n“Identity” and “sameness” mean the same; their\nmeanings are identical. However, they have more than one meaning. A\ndistinction is customarily drawn between qualitative and\nnumerical identity or sameness. Things with qualitative\nidentity share properties, so things can be more or less qualitatively\nidentical. Poodles and Great Danes are qualitatively identical because\nthey share the property of being a dog, and such properties as go along\nwith that, but two poodles will (very likely) have greater qualitative\nidentity. Numerical identity requires absolute, or total, qualitative\nidentity, and can only hold between a thing and itself. Its name\nimplies the controversial view that it is the only identity relation in\naccordance with which we can properly count (or number) things:\nx and y are to be properly counted as one just in\ncase they are numerically identical (Geach 1973). \n\nNumerical identity is our topic. As noted, it is at the centre of\nseveral philosophical debates, but to many seems in itself wholly\nunproblematic, for it is just that relation everything has to itself\nand nothing else – and what could be less problematic than that?\nMoreover, if the notion is problematic it is difficult to see how the\nproblems could be resolved, since it is difficult to see how a thinker\ncould have the conceptual resources with which to explain the concept\nof identity whilst lacking that concept itself. The basicness of the\nnotion of identity in our conceptual scheme, and, in particular, the\nlink between identity and quantification has been particularly noted by\nQuine (1964). \n\nNumerical identity can be characterised, as just done, as the\nrelation everything has to itself and to nothing else. But this is\ncircular, since “nothing else” just means “no\nnumerically non-identical thing”. It can be defined, equally\ncircularly (because quantifying over all equivalence relations\nincluding itself), as the smallest equivalence relation (an equivalence\nrelation being one which is reflexive, symmetric and transitive, for\nexample, having the same shape). Other circular definitions are\navailable. Usually it is defined as the equivalence relation (or: the\nreflexive relation) satisfying Leibniz’s Law, the principle of the\nindiscernibility of identicals, that if x is identical with\ny then everything true of x is true of y.\nIntuitively this is right, but only picks out identity uniquely if\n“what is true of x” is understood to include\n“being identical with x”; otherwise it is too\nweak. Circularity is thus not avoided. Nevertheless, Leibniz’s Law\nappears to be crucial to our understanding of identity, and, more\nparticularly, to our understanding of distinctness: we exhibit our\ncommitment to it whenever we infer from “Fa” and\n“Not-Fb” that a is not identical with\nb. Strictly, what is being employed in such inferences is the\ncontrapositive of Leibniz’s Law (if something true of a is\nfalse of b, a is not identical with b),\nwhich some (in the context of the discussion of vague identity) have\nquestioned, but it appears as indispensable to our grip on the concept\nof identity as Leibniz’s Law itself. \n\nThe converse of Leibniz’s Law, the principle of the identity of\nindiscernibles, that if everything true of x is true of\ny, x is identical with y, is correspondingly\ntrivial if “what is true of x” is understood to\ninclude “being identical with y” (as required if\nLeibniz’s Law is to characterise identity uniquely among equivalence\nrelations). But often it is read with “what is true of\nx” restricted, e.g., to qualitative, non-relational,\nproperties of x. It then becomes philosophically\ncontroversial. Thus it is debated whether a symmetrical universe is\npossible, e.g., a universe containing two qualitatively\nindistinguishable spheres and nothing else (Black 1952). \n\nLeibniz’s Law has itself been subject to controversy in the sense\nthat the correct explanation of apparent counter-examples has been\ndebated. Leibniz’s Law must be clearly distinguished from the\nsubstitutivity principle, that if “a” and\n“b” are codesignators (if\n“a=b” is a true sentence of English) they\nare everywhere substitutable salva veritate. This principle is\ntrivially false. “Hesperus” contains eight letters,\n“Phosphorus” contains ten, but Hesperus (the Evening Star)\nis Phosphorus (the Morning Star). Again, despite the identity, it is\ninformative to be told that Hesperus is Phosphorus, but not to be told\nthat Hesperus is Hesperus (“On Sense and Reference” in\nFrege 1969). Giorgione was so-called because of his size, Barbarelli\nwas not, but Giorgione was Barbarelli (Quine, “Reference and\nModality”, in 1963) . It is a necessary truth that 9 is greater\nthan 7, it is not a necessary truth that the number of planets is\ngreater than 7, although 9 is the number of planets. The explanation of\nthe failure of the substitutivity principle can differ from case to\ncase. In the first example, it is plausible to say that\n“‘Hesperus’ contains eight letters” is not\nabout Hesperus, but about the name, and the same is true, mutatis\nmutandis, of “‘Phosphorus’ contains ten\nletters”. Thus the names do not have the same referents in the\nidentity statement and the predications. In the Giorgione/Barbarelli\nexample this seems less plausible. Here the correct explanation is\nplausibly that “is so-called because of his size” expresses\ndifferent properties depending on the name it is attached to, and so\nexpresses the property of being called “Barbarelli” because\nof his size when attached to “Barbarelli” and being called\n“Giorgione” because of his size when attached to\n“Giorgione”. It is more controversial how to explain the\nHesperus/Phosphorus and 9/the number of planets examples. Frege’s own\nexplanation of the former was to assimilate it to the\n“Hesperus”/“Phosphorus” case: in “It is\ninformative to be told that Hesperus is Phosphorus” the names do\nnot stand for their customary referent but for their senses. A Fregean\nexplanation of the 9/number of planets example may also be offered:\n“it is necessary that” creates a context in which numerical\ndesignators stand for senses rather than numbers. \n\nFor present purposes the important point to recognise is that,\nhowever these counter-examples to the substitutivity principle are\nexplained, they are not counter-examples to Leibniz’s Law, which says\nnothing about substitutivity of codesignators in any language. \n\nThe view of identity just put forward (henceforth “the\nclassical view”) characterises it as the equivalence relation\nwhich everything has to itself and to nothing else and which satisfies\nLeibniz’s Law. These formal properties ensure that, within any theory\nexpressible by means of a fixed stock of one- or many-place predicates,\nquantifiers and truth-functional connectives, any two predicates which\ncan be regarded as expressing identity (i.e., any predicates satisfying\nthe two schemata “for all x, Rxx” and\n“for all x, for all y, Rxy →\n(Fx → Fy)” for any one-place predicate in\nplace of “F”) will be extensionally equivalent.\nThey do not, however, ensure that any two-place predicate does express\nidentity within a particular theory, for it may simply be that the\ndescriptive resources of the theory are insufficiently rich to\ndistinguish items between which the equivalence relation expressed by\nthe predicate holds (“Identity” in Geach 1972). \n\nFollowing Geach, call a two-place predicate with these properties in\na theory an “I-predicate” in that theory. Relative to\nanother, richer, theory the same predicate, interpreted in the same\nway, may not be an I-predicate. If so it will not, and did not even in\nthe poorer theory, express identity. For example, “having the\nsame income as” will be an I-predicate in a theory in which\npersons with the same income are indistinguishable, but not in a richer\ntheory. \n\nQuine (1950) has suggested that when a predicate is an I-predicate in\na theory only because the language in which the theory is expressed\ndoes not allow one to distinguish items between which it holds, one\ncan reinterpret the sentences of the theory so that the I-predicate in\nthe newly interpreted theory does express identity. Every sentence\nwill have just the same truth-conditions under the new interpretation\nand the old, but the references of its subsentential parts will be\ndifferent. Thus, Quine suggests, if one has a language in which one\nspeaks of persons and in which persons of the same income are\nindistinguishable the predicates of the language may be reinterpreted\nso that the predicate which previously expressed having the same\nincome comes now to express identity. The universe of discourse\nnow consists of income groups, not people. The extensions of the\nmonadic predicates are classes of income groups, and, in general, the\nextension of an\nn-place predicate is a class of n-member sequences of\nincome groups (Quine 1963: 65–79). Any two-place predicate expressing\nan equivalence relation could be an I-predicate relative to some\nsufficiently impoverished theory, and Quine’s suggestion will be\napplicable to any such predicate if it is applicable at all. \n\nBut it remains that it is not guaranteed that a two-place predicate\nthat is an I-predicate in the theory to which it belongs expresses\nidentity. In fact, no condition can be stated in a first-order language\nfor a predicate to express identity, rather than mere indiscernibility\nby the resources of the language. However, in a second-order language,\nin which quantification over all properties (not just those\nfor which the language contains predicates) is possible and Leibniz’s\nLaw is therefore statable, identity can be uniquely characterised.\nIdentity is thus not first-order, but only second-order definable. \n\nThis situation provides the basis for Geach’s radical contention that\nthe notion of absolute identity has no application and that there is\nonly relative identity. This section contains a brief discussion of\nGeach’s complex view. (For more details see the entry on\n relative identity,\n Deutsch 1997, Dummett 1981 and 1991, Hawthorne 2003\nand Noonan 2017.) Geach maintains that since no criterion can be given\nby which a predicate expressing an I-predicate may be determined to\nexpress, not merely indiscernibility relative to the language to which\nit belongs, but also absolute indiscernibility, we should jettison the\nclassical notion of identity (1991). He dismisses the possibility of\ndefining identity in a second-order language on the ground of the\nparadoxical nature of unrestricted quantification over properties and\naims his fire particularly at Quine’s proposal that an I-predicate in\na first-order theory may always be interpreted as expressing\nabsolute identity (even if such an interpretation is not\nrequired).  Geach objects that Quine’s suggestion leads to a\n“Baroque Meinongian ontology” and is inconsistent with\nQuine’s own expressed preference for “desert landscapes”\n(“Identity” in Geach 1972: 245). \n\nWe may usefully state Geach’s thesis using the terminology of\nabsolute and relative equivalence relations. Let us say that an\nequivalence relation R is absolute if and only if, if\nx stands in it to y, there cannot be some other\nequivalence relation S, holding between anything and either\nx or y, but not holding between x and\ny. If an equivalence relation is not absolute it is relative.\nClassical identity is an absolute equivalence relation. Geach’s main\ncontention is that any expression for an absolute equivalence relation\nin any possible language will have the null class as its extension, and\nso there can be no expression for classical identity in any possible\nlanguage. This is the thesis he argues against Quine. \n\nGeach also maintains the sortal relativity of identity statements,\nthat “x is the same A as y” does\nnot “split up” into “x is an A and\ny is an A and x=y”. More\nprecisely stated, what Geach denies is that whenever a term\n“A” is interpretable as a sortal term in a\nlanguage L (a term which makes (independent) sense following\n“the same”) the expression (interpretable as)\n“x is the same A as y” in\nlanguage L will be satisfied by a pair\n<x,y> only if the I-predicate of L is\nsatisfied by <x,y>. Geach’s thesis of the\nsortal relativity of identity thus neither entails nor is entailed by\nhis thesis of the inexpressibility of identity. It is the sortal\nrelativity thesis that is the central issue between Geach and Wiggins\n(1967 and 1980). It entails that a relation expressible in the form\n“x is the same A as y” in a\nlanguage L, where “A” is a sortal term in\nL, need not entail indiscernibility even by the resources of\nL. \n\nGeach’s argument against Quine exists in two versions, an earlier\nand a later. \n\nIn its earlier version the argument is merely that following Quine’s\nsuggestion to interpret a language in which some expression is an\nI-predicate so that the I-predicate expresses classical identity sins\nagainst a highly intuitive methodological programme enunciated by Quine\nhimself, namely that as our knowledge expands we should unhesitatingly\nexpand our ideology, our stock of predicables, but should be much more\nwary about altering our ontology, the interpretation of our bound name\nvariables (1972: 243). \n\nGeach’s argument is that in view of the mere possibility of carving\nout of a language L, in which the relational expressions,\nE1, E2,\nE3… are not I-predicates, sub-languages\nL1, L2,\nL3… in which these expressions are\nI-predicates, if Quine’s suggested proposal of reinterpretation is\npossible for each Ln, the user of\nL will be committed to any number of entities not quantified\nover in L, namely, for each Ln,\nthose entities for which the I-predicate of\nLn (En) gives\na criterion of absolute identity. This will be so because any sentence\nof L will retain its truth conditions in any\nLn to which it belongs, reinterpreted as\nQuine proposes, but “of course, it is flatly inconsistent to say\nthat as a member of a large theory a sentence retains its\ntruth-conditions but not its ontological commitment”\n(1973:299). \n\nThe crucial premiss of this argument is thus that sameness of\ntruth-conditions entails sameness of ontological commitment. But this\nis not true. The ontological commitments of a theory (according to\nQuine, whose notion this is) are those entities that must lie within\nthe domain of quantification of the theory if the theory is to be true;\nor, the entities the predicates of the theory have to be true of if the\ntheory is to be true. A theory is not ontologically committed, we may\nsay, to whatever has to be in the universe for it to be true,\nbut only to whatever has to be in its universe for it to be\ntrue. Thus there is no argument from sameness of truth-conditions to\nsameness of ontological commitments. \n\nThe later version of Geach’s argument needs a different response.\nThe difference between the earlier version and the later one is that in\nthe later (to be found in Geach 1973) Geach’s claim is not merely that\nQuine’s thesis about possible reinterpretation has a consequence which\nis unpalatable, but that it leads to an out-and-out logical absurdity,\nthe existence of what he calls “absolute surmen” (entities\nfor which having the same surname constitutes a criterion of absolute\nidentity, ie., entails indiscernibility in all respects). Because Geach\nis now making this stronger claim, the objection that his argument\ndepends upon the incorrect assumption that sameness of truth-conditions\nentails sameness of ontological commitment is no longer relevant. In\norder to make out his case Geach has to establish just two points.\nFirst, that there are sentences of English supplemented by the\npredicate “is the same surman as” (explained to mean\n“is a man and has the same surname as”), which are\nevidently true and which, considered as sentences of that fragment of\nEnglish in which “is the same surman as” is an I-predicate,\nwhen this is interpreted in the way Quine suggests, can be true only if\nabsolute surmen exist. And secondly, that the existence of absolute\nsurmen is absurd. \n\nBut in the end Geach fails to establish these two points. Quine would\nsay that, for the fragment of English in question, the domain of the\nvariables can be considered to consist of classes of men with the same\nsurname and the predicates interpreted as holding of such classes.\nThus, the predicate “is the same surman as” will no longer\nbe true of pairs of men if we adopt Quine’s suggestion\n(I am writing, remember in English, not in the fragment of English\nunder discussion), but rather of pairs of classes of men with the same\nsurname – these then will be Geach’s “absolute\nsurmen”. Now, Geach attempts to rule this out by the argument\nthat “whatever is a surman is by definition a man.” But\nthis argument fails. The predicate “is a man” will also be\nin the language-fragment in which “is the same surman as”\nis the I-predicate; and so it, too, will, be reinterpreted, if we\nfollow Quine’s suggestion, as holding of classes of men with the\nsame surname. Thus the sentence “Whatever is a surman is a\nman” will be true in the language fragment interpreted in\nQuine’s way, just as it is in English as a whole. What will not\nbe true, however, is that whatever the predicate “is a\nsurman” is true of, as it occurs in the language-fragment\nreinterpreted in Quine’s way, is a thing of which “is\na man”, as it occurs in English as a whole, is true\nof. But Geach has no right to demand that this should be the\ncase. Even so, this demand can be met. For the domain of the\ninterpretation of the language fragment in which “is the same\nsurman as” is the I-predicate can, in fact, be taken to consist\nof men, namely, to be a class containing exactly one representative\nman for each class of men with the same surname. Thus, as Geach says,\nabsolute surmen will be just some among men (1973, 100). Geach goes\non, “there will, for example, be just one surman with the\nsurname ‘Jones’, but if this is an absolute surman, and he\nis a certain man, then which of the Jones boys is he?” But this\nquestion, which is, of course, only answerable using predicates which\nbelong to the part of English not included in the language fragment in\nwhich “is the same surman as” is the I-predicate, is not\nan impossible one to answer. It is merely that the answer will depend\nupon the particular interpretation that the language fragment has, in\nfact, been given. Geach is, therefore not entitled to go on,\n“Surely we have run into an absurdity.” It thus seems that\nhis argument for the non-existence of absolute identity fails. \n\nGeach’s argument for his second thesis, that of the sortal\nrelativity of identity, is that it provides the best solution to a\nvariety of well known puzzles about identity and counting at a time and\nover time. The most well known puzzle is that of the cat on the mat,\nwhich comes in two versions. \n\nThe first version goes like this. (Wiggins 1968 contains the first\nappearance of this version in present-day philosophical literature; an\nequivalent puzzle is that of Dion and Theon, see Burke 1995.) Suppose\na cat, Tibbles, is sitting on a mat. Now consider that portion of\nTibbles that includes everything except its tail – its\n“tail complement” – and call it\n“Tib”. Tib is smaller than Tibbles so they are not\nidentical. But what if we now amputate the cat’s tail? (A\ntime-reversed, or “growing”, version can be considered in\nwhich a tail is grafted on to a tailless cat; the same responses\nconsidered below will be available, but may differ in relative\nplausibility.) Tibbles and Tib will now coincide. If Tibbles is still\na cat, it is hard to see by what criterion one could deny that Tib is\na cat. Yet they are distinct individuals, since they have different\nhistories. But there is just one cat on the mat. So they cannot be\ndistinct cats. They must be the same cat, even though they are\ndistinct individuals; and so identity under the sortal concept\ncat must be a relative identity relation. \n\nThe second version (presented in Geach 1980, compare Unger 1980)\ngoes as follows. Tibbles is sitting on the mat and is the only cat\nsitting on the mat. But Tibbles has at least 1,000 hairs. Geach\ncontinues: “Now let c be the largest continuous mass of\nfeline tissue on the mat. Then for any of our 1,000 hairs, say\nhn, there is a proper part\ncn of c which contains precisely\nall of c except that hair hn; and\nevery such part cn differs in a\ndescribable way both from any other such part say\ncm, and from c as a whole.\nMoreover, fuzzy as the concept cat may be, it is clear that\nnot only is c a cat, but also any part\ncn is a cat:\ncn would clearly be a cat were the hair\nhn to be plucked out, and we cannot\nreasonably suppose that plucking out a hair generates a cat,\nso cn must already have been a\ncat.” \n\nThe conclusion, of course, is the same as in the previous version of\nthe argument: there is only one cat on the mat so all the distinct\nentities that qualify as cats must be the same cat. \n\nThis version of the argument can be resisted by insisting that the\nconcept of a cat is maximal, i.e. no proper part of a cat is a\ncat. The first version may be resisted in a variety of ways. Some deny\nthe existence of the tail-complement at all (van Inwagen 1981, Olson\n1995); others deny that the tail-complement survives the amputation\n(Burke 1995). Another possibility is to say that certain of the\nhistorical and/or modal predicates possessed by Tibbles and not Tib\nare essential to being a cat, so that Tib is not (predicatively) a cat\n(Wiggins 1980). Again, it can be accepted that both Tib and Tibbles\nare cats, but deny that in counting them as one we are counting by\nidentity, rather, we are counting by “almost identity”\n(Lewis 1993). Another possibility is to accept that both Tib and\nTibbles are cats, but deny that they are distinct: rather\n“Tib” and “Tibbles” are two names of the same\ncat-stage (Hawley 2001, Sider 2001). \n\n\nThere is, then, no very compelling argument for Geach’s sortal\nrelativity thesis to be based on such examples, given the variety of\nresponses available, some of which will be returned to below. On the\nother hand, no alternative solution to the puzzle of the cat on the\nmat stands out as clearly superior to the rest, or clearly superior to\nthe sortal relativity thesis as a solution. We should conclude that\nthis component of Geach’s position, though not proven, is not refuted\neither, and, possibly, that the linguistic data provide no basis for a\ndecision for or against. \n\nA notion that Geach deploys extensively, and which is also in common\nuse by his opponents, is that of a criterion of identity, a standard by\nwhich identity is to be judged. This section will attempt to untangle\nsome of the complexities this notion involves. \n\nThe notion of a criterion of identity was introduced into\nphilosophical terminology by Frege (1884) and strongly emphasised by\nWittgenstein (1958). Exactly how it is to be interpreted and the extent\nof its applicability are still matters of debate. \n\nA considerable obstacle to understanding contemporary philosophical\nusage of the term, however, is that the notion does not seem to be a\nunitary one. In the case of abstract objects (the case discussed by\nFrege) the criterion of identity for Fs is thought of as an\nequivalence relation holding between objects distinct from Fs.\nThus the criterion of identity for directions is parallelism of\nlines, that is, the direction of line a is identical\nwith the direction of line b if and only if line a\nis parallel to line b. The criterion of identity for numbers\nis equinumerosity of concepts, that is, the number\nof As is identical with the number of Bs if and only\nif there are exactly as many As as Bs. The relation\nbetween the criterion of identity for Fs and the criterion of\napplication for the concept F (the standard for the\napplication of the concept to an individual) is then said by some\n(Wright and Hale 2001) to be that to be an F is just to be\nsomething for which questions of identity and distinctness are to\nsettled by appeal to the criterion of identity for Fs. (Thus,\nwhen Frege went on to give an explicit definition of numbers as\nextensions of concepts he appealed to it only to deduce what has come\nto be called Hume’s Principle – his statement of his\ncriterion of identity for numbers in terms of equinumerosity of\nconcepts, and emphasised that he regarded the appeal to extensions as\ninessential.)  In the case of concrete objects, however, things seem\nto stand differently. Often the criterion of identity for a concrete\nobject of type F is said to be a relation R such\nthat for any\nFs, x and y, x=y if and\nonly if Rxy. In this case the criterion of identity for\nFs is not stated as a relation between entities distinct from\nFs and the criterion of identity cannot plausibly be thought\nof as determining the criterion of application. Another example of the\nlack of uniformity in the notion of a criterion of identity\nin contemporary philosophy is, in the case of concrete objects, a\ndistinction customarily made between a criterion of diachronic identity\nand a criterion of synchronic identity; the former taking the form\n“x is at t the same F as y is\nat t′ if and only if…”, where what fills\nthe gap is some statement of a relation holding between objects\nx and y and times t and t′.\n(In the case of persons, for example, a candidate criterion of\ndiachronic identity is: x is at t the same person as\ny is at t′ if and only if x at\nt is psychologically continuous with y at\nt′.) A criterion of synchronic identity, by contrast,\nwill typically specify how the parts of an F-thing existing at\na time must be related, or how one F at a time is marked off\nfrom another. \n\nOne way of bringing system into the discussion of criteria of identity\nis to make use of the distinction between one-level and two-level\ncriteria of identity (Williamson 1990, Lowe 2012). The Fregean\ncriteria of identity for directions and numbers are two-level. The\nobjects for which the criterion is given are distinct from, and can be\npictured as at a higher level than, the entities between which the\nrelation specified holds. A two-level criterion for the Fs\ntakes the form (restricting ourselves to examples in which the\ncriterial relation holds between objects): \ne.g., If x and y are lines then the direction\nof x is identical with the direction of y\niff x and y are parallel. \n\nA two-level criterion of identity is thus in the first place an\nimpliicit definition of a function “d( )”\n(e.g., “the direction of”) in terms of which the sortal\npredicate “is an F” can be defined (“is a\ndirection” can be defined as “is the direction of some\nline”). Consistently with the two-level criterion of identity\nstated several distinct functions may be the reference of the functor\n“d”. Hence, as emphasised by Lowe (1997: section 6),\ntwo-level criteria of identity are neither definitions of identity,\nnor of identity restricted to a certain sort (for identity is\nuniversal), nor even of the sortal terms denoting the sorts for which\nthey provide criteria. They merely constrain, but not to uniqueness,\nthe possible referents of the functor “d” they implicitly\ndefine and they thus give a merely necessary condition for falling\nunder the sortal predicate “is an F” (where\n“x is an F” is explained to mean\n“for some y, x is identical with\nd(y)”). \n\nOn the other hand, the criterion of identity for sets given by the\nAxiom of Extensionality (sets are the same iff they have the same\nmembers), unlike the criterion of identity for numbers given by Hume’s\nPrinciple, and Davidson’s criterion of event identity (events are the\nsame iff they have the same causes and effects (“The\nIndividuation of Events” in his 1980)) are one-level: the\nobjects for which the criterion of identity is stated are the same as\nthose between which the criterial relation obtains. In general, a\none-level criterion for objects of sort F takes the form: \n\nNot all criteria of identity can be two-level (on pain of infinite\nregress), and it is tempting to think that the distinction between\nobjects for which a two-level criterion is possible and those for\nwhich only a one-level criterion is possible coincides with that\nbetween abstract and concrete objects (and so, that a two-level\ncriterion for sets must be possible). \n\nHowever, a more general application of the two-level notion is\npossible. In fact, it can be applied to any type of object K,\nsuch that the criterion of identity for\nKs can be thought of as an equivalence relation between a\ndistinct type of object, K*s, but some such objects may\nintuitively be regarded as concrete. \n\nHow general this makes its application is a matter of controversy.\nIn particular, if persisting things are thought of as composed of\n(instantaneous) temporal parts (see discussion below), the problem of\nsupplying a diachronic criterion of identity for persisting concrete objects can\nbe regarded as the problem of providing a two-level criterion. But if\npersisting things are not thought of in this way then not all\npersisting things can be provided with two-level criteria. (Though some\ncan. For example, it is quite plausible that the criterion of identity\nover time for persons should be thought of as given by a relation\nbetween bodies.) \n\nAs noted by Lowe (1997) and Wright and Hale (2001) any two-level\ncriterion can be restated in a one-level form (though, of course, not\nconversely). For example, to say that the direction of line a\nis identical with the direction of line b if and only if\nline a is parallel to line b is to say that\ndirections are the same if and only if the lines they are of are\nparallel, which is the form of a one-level criterion. A way of\nunifying the various different ways of talking of criteria of identity\nis thus to take as the paradigmatic form of a statement of a criterion\nof identity a statement of the form: for any x, for any\ny, if x is an F and y is an\nF then x=y if and only if Rxy (Lowe\n1989, 1997). \n\nIf the notion is interpreted in this way then the relation between\nthe criterion of identity and the criterion of application will be that\nof one-way determination. The criterion of identity will be determined\nby, but not determine, the criterion of application. \n\nFor, in general, a one-level criterion of identity for Fs as\nexplained above is equivalent to the conjunction of: Each of these gives a merely necessary condition for being\nan F. And the second says something about Fs which\nis not true of everything only if “Rxy” does not\nentail “x=y” \n\nTogether these are equivalent to the proposition that every F\nis the F “R-related” to it. By its form this\nstates a merely necessary conditon for being a thing of sort\n“F”. The one-level criterion of identity thus again merely\nspecifies a necessary condition of being an object of sort\n“F”. \n\nHence, once the necessary and sufficient conditons of being an\n“F” are laid down, no further stipulation is\nrequired of a criterion of “F”-identity, whether\none-level or two-level. \n\nThis conclusion is, of course, in agreement with Lewis’s view that\nthere are no genuine problems about identity as such (Lewis 1986, Ch.\n4), but it is in tension with the thought that sortal concepts, as\ndistinct from adjectival concepts, are to be characterised by their\ninvolvement of criteria of identity as well as criteria of\napplication. \n\nA conception of identity criteria which allows this characterisation\nof the notion of a sortal concept, and which has so far not been\nmentioned, is that of Dummett (1981). Dummett denies that a criterion\nof identity must always be regarded as a criterion of identity for a\ntype of object. There is a basic level, he suggests, at which\nwhat a criterion of identity is a criterion of, is the truth of a\nstatement in which no objects are referred to. Such a\nstatement can be expressed using demonstratives and pointing gestures,\nfor instance, by saying “This is the same cat as that”,\npointing first to a head and then a tail. In such a statement, which he\ncalls a statement of identification, in Dummett’s view, there need be\nno reference to objects made by the use of the demonstratives, any more\nthan reference is made to any object in a feature-placing sentence like\n“It’s hot here”. A statement of identification is merely,\nas it were, a feature-placing relational statement, like “This is\ndarker than that”. A grasp of a sortal concept F\ninvolves both grasp of the truth-conditions of such statements of\nidentification involving “F” and also grasp of the\ntruth-conditions of what Dummett calls “crude predications”\ninvolving “F”, statements of the form “this\nis F”, in which the demonstrative again does not serve\nto refer to any object. Adjectival terms, which have only a criterion\nof application and no criterion of identity, are ones which have a use\nin such crude predications, but no use in statements of identification.\nSortal terms, as just noted, have a use in both contexts, and sortal\nterms may share their criteria of application but differ in their\ncriteria of identity since grasp of the truth-conditions of the crude\npredication “This is F” does not determine grasp\nof the truth-conditions of the statement of identification “This\nis the same F as that” (thus I can know when it is right\nto say “This is a book” without knowing when it is right to\nsay “This is the same book as that”). \n\nOn Dummett’s account, then, it may be possible to accept that whenever\na criterion of identity for a type of object is to be given\nit must be (expressible as) a two-level criterion, which implicity\ndefines a functor. Essentially one-level criteria (one-level criteria\nnot expressible in a two-level form) are redundant, determined by\nspecifications of necessary and sufficient conditions for being\nobjects of the sorts in question. \n\nAs noted in the last section, another source of apparent disunity in\nthe concept of a criterion of identity is the distinction made between\nsynchronic criteria of identity and diachronic criteria of\nidentity. Criteria of identity can be employed synchronically, as in\nthe examples just given, to determine whether two coexistent objects\nare parts of the same object of a sort, or diachronically, to\ndetermine identity over time. But as Lowe notes (2012: 137), it is an\nerror to suppose that diachronic identity and synchronic identity are\ndifferent kinds of identity and so demand different kinds of identity\ncriteria. What then is a criterion of identity over time? \n\nIdentity over time is itself a controversial notion, however, because\ntime involves change. Heraclitus argued that one could not bathe in\nthe same river twice because new waters were ever flowing in. Hume\nargued that identity over time was a fiction we substitute for a\ncollection of related objects. Such views can be seen as based on a\nmisunderstanding of Leibniz’s Law: if a thing changes something is\ntrue of it at the later time that is not true of it at the earlier, so\nit is not the same. The answer is that what is true of it at the later\ntime is, say, “being muddy at the later time”, which was\nalways true of it; similarly, what is true of it at the earlier time,\nsuitably expressed, remains true of it. But the question remains how\nto characterise identity through time and across change given that\nthere is such a thing. \n\nOne topic which has always loomed large in this debate has been the\nissue (in the terminology of Lewis 1986, Ch. 4) of perdurance\nversus endurance. (Others, for which there is no space for\ndiscussion here, include the debate over Ship of Theseus and\nreduplication or fission problems and associated issues about\n“best candidate” or “no rival candidate”\naccounts of identity over time, and the debate over Humean\nsupervenience – see articles on relative identity, personal\nidentity, Hawley 2001 and Sider 2001.) \n\nAccording to one view, material objects persist by having\ntemporal parts or stages, which exist at different times and\nare to be distinguished by the times at which they exist – this\nis known as the view that material objects perdure. Other philosophers\ndeny that this is so; according to them, when a material object exists\nat different times, it is wholly present at those times, for it has no\ntemporal parts, but only spatial parts, which likewise are wholly\npresent at the different times they exist. This is known as the view\nthat material objects endure. \n\nPerdurance theorists, as Quine puts it, reject the point of view\ninherent in the tenses of our natural language. From that point of view\npersisting things endure and change through time, but do not\nextend through time, but only through space. Thus persisting\nthings are to be sharply distinguished from events or processes, which\nprecisely do extend through time. One way of describing the position of\nthe perdurance theorist, then, is to say that he denies the existence\nof a distinct ontological category of persisting things, or\nsubstances. Thus, Quine writes, “physical objects, conceived thus\nfour-dimensionally in space-time, are not to be distinguished from\nevents, or, in the concrete sense of the term, processes. Each\ncomprises simply the content, however heterogeneous, of some portion of\nspace-time, however disconnected and gerrymandered”\n(1960:171). \n\nIn recent controversy two arguments have been at the centre of the\nendurance/perdurance debate, one employed by perdurance theorists and\nthe other by endurance theorists (for other arguments and issues see\nthe separate article on temporal parts, Hawley 2001 and Sider\n2001). \n\nAn argument for perdurance which has been hotly debated is due to\nDavid Lewis (1986). If perdurance is rejected, the ascription of dated\nor tensed properties to objects must be regarded as assertions of\nirreducible relations between objects and times.  If Tabby is\nfat on Monday, that is a relation between Tabby and Monday, and if\nperdurance is rejected it is an irreducible relation between Tabby and\nMonday. According to perdurance theory, however, while it is still, of\ncourse, a relation between Tabby and Monday it is not irrreducible; it\nholds between Tabby and Monday because the temporal part of Tabby on\nMonday, Tabby-on-Monday, is intrinsically fat. If perdurance is\nrejected, however, no such intrinsic possessor of the property of\nfatness can be recognised: Tabby’s fatness on Monday must be regarded\nas an irreducible state of affairs. \n\nAccording to Lewis, this consequence of the rejection of the\nperdurance theory is incredible. Whether he is right about this is the\nsubject of intense debate (Haslanger 2003). \n\nEven if Lewis is right, however, the perdurance theory may still be\nfound wanting, since it does not secure the most commonsensical\nposition: that fatness is a property of a cat (Haslanger\n2003). According to perdurance theory, rather, it is a property of a\n(temporal) cat part. Those known as stage theorists (Hawley 2001, Sider\n2001), accepting the ontology of perdurance theory, but modifying its\nsemantics, offer a way to secure this desirable result. Every temporal\npart of a cat is a cat, they say, so Tabby-on-Monday (which is\nwhat we refer to by “Tabby”, on Monday) is a cat and is\nfat, just as we would like. Stage theorists have to pay a price for\nthis advantage over perdurance theory, however. For they must accept\neither that our reports of the cross-temporal number of cats\nare not always reports of the counting of cats (as when I say, truly,\nthat I have only ever owned three cats) or that two cat-stages\n(cats) may be counted as one and the same cat, so that counting cats is\nnot always counting in accordance with absolute identity. \n\nAn argument against the perdurance theory that has been\nthe focus of interest is one presented in various guises by a\nnumber of writers, including Wiggins (1980), Thomson (1983) and van\nInwagen (1990). Applied to persons (it can equally well be applied to\nother persisting things), it asserts that persons have different\nproperties, in particular, different modal properties, from the\nsummations of person-stages with which the perdurance theory identifies\nthem. Thus, by Leibniz’s Law, this identification must be mistaken. As\nDavid Wiggins states the argument: “Anything that is a part of a\nLesniewskian sum [a mereological whole defined by its parts] is\nnecessarily part of it…But no person or normal material object\nis necessarily in the total state that will correspond to the\nperson- or object-moment postulated by the theory under\ndiscussion” (1980: 168). \n\nTo elaborate a little. I might have died when I was five years old.\nBut that maximal summation of person-stages which, according to\nperdurance theory, is me and has a temporal extent of at least\nfifty years, could not have had a temporal extent of a mere five years.\nSo I cannot be such a summation of stages. \n\nThis argument illustrates the interdependence of the various topics\ndiscussed under the rubric of identity. Whether it is valid, of course,\ndepends on the correct analysis of modal predication, and, in\nparticular, on whether it should be analysed in terms of\n“identity across possible worlds” or in terms of Lewisean\ncounterpart theory. This is the topic of the next section. \n\nIn the interpretation of modal discourse recourse is often made to\nthe idea of “identity across possible worlds”. If modal\ndiscourse is interpreted in this way it becomes natural to regard a\nstatement ascribing a modal property to an individual as asserting the\nidentity of that individual across worlds: “John might have been\na millionaire”, on this view, asserts that there is a possible\nworld in which an individual identical with John is a millionaire.\n“John could not have been a millionaire” asserts that in\nany world in which an individual identical with John exists that\nindividual is not a millionaire. \n\nHowever, though this is perhaps the most natural way to interpret\nde re modal statements (once it has been accepted that the\napparatus of possible worlds is to be used as an interpretative tool),\nthere are well-known difficulties that make the approach\nproblematic. \n\nFor example, it seems reasonable to suppose that a complex artefact\nlike a bicycle could have been made of different parts. On the other\nhand, it does not seem right that the same bicycle could have been\nconstructed out of completely different parts. \n\nBut now consider a series of possible worlds, beginning with the\nactual world, each containing a bicycle just slightly different from\nthe one in the previous world, the last world in the sequence being one\nin which there is a bicycle composed of completely different parts from\nthe one in the actual world. One cannot say that each bicycle is\nidentical with the one in the neighbouring world, but not identical\nwith the corresponding bicycle in distant worlds, since identity is\ntransitive. Hence it seems one must either adopt an extreme\nmereological essentialism, according to which no difference of parts is\npossible for an individual, or reject the interpretation of de\nre modal discourse as asserting identity across possible\nworlds. \n\nThis and other problems with cross-world identity suggest that some\nother weaker relation, of similarity or what David Lewis calls\ncounterparthood, should be employed in a possible world analysis of\nmodal discourse. Since similarity is not transitive this allows us to\nsay that the bicycle might have had some different parts without having\nto say that it might have been wholly different. On the other hand,\nsuch a substitution does not seem unproblematic, for a claim about what\nI might have done hardly seems, at first sight, to be\ncorrectly interpretable as a claim about what someone else\n(however similar to me) does in another possible world (Kripke 1972\n[1980], note 13). \n\nAn assessment of the counterpart theoretic analysis is vital not\njust to understanding modal discourse, however, but also to getting to\nthe correct account of identity over time. For, as we saw,\nthe argument against perdurance theory outlined at the end of the last\nsection depends on the correct interpretation of modal discourse. In\nfact, it is invalid on a counterpart theoretic analysis which allows\ndifferent counterpart relations (different similarity relations) to be\ninvoked according to the sense of the singular term which is the\nsubject of the de re modal predication (Lewis 1986, Ch. 4),\nsince the counterpart relation relevant to the assessment of a de\nre modal predication with a singular term whose sense determines\nthat it refers to a person will be different from that relevant to the\nassessment of a de re modal predication with a singular term\nwhose sense determines that it refers to a sum of person-stages.\n“I might have existed for only five years” means on the\nLewisean account “There is a person in some possible world\nsimilar to me in those respects important to personhood who exists for\nonly five years”; “The maximal summation of person stages\nof which this current stage is a stage might have existed for only five\nyears” means “There is a summation of person stages similar\nto this one in those respects important to the status of an entity as a\nsummation of stages which exists for only five years”. Since the\ntwo similarity relations in question are distinct the first modal\nstatement may be true and the second false even if I am identical with\nthe sum of stages in question. \n\nCounterpart theory is also significant to the topic of identity over\ntime in another way, since it provides the analogy to which the stage\ntheorist (who regards all everyday reference as reference to momentary\nstages rather than to perdurers) appeals to explain de re\ntemporal predication. Thus, according to the stage theorist, just as\n“I might have been fat” does not require the existence of a\npossible world in which an object identical with me is fat, but only\nthe existence of a world in which a (modal) counterpart of me is fat,\nso “I used to be fat” does not require the existence of a\npast time at which someone identical with (the present momentary stage\nwhich is) me was fat, but only the existence of a past time at which a\n(temporal) counterpart of me was fat. The problem of identity over time\nfor things of a kind, for stage theorists, is just the problem of\ncharacterizing the appropriate temporal counterpart relation for things\nof that kind. \n\nFor a more detailed discussion of the topic,\nsee the entry \n  transworld identity.\n Whether de re modal discourse is to be interpreted in terms\nof identity across possible worlds or counterpart theoretically (or in\nsome other way entirely) is also relevant to our next topic, that of\ncontingent identity.    \n\nBefore Kripke’s writings (1972 [1980]), it seemed a platitude that\nstatements of identity could be contingent – when they contained\ntwo terms differing in sense but identical in reference and so were not\nanalytic. Kripke challenged this platitude, though, of course, he did\nnot reject the possibility of contingent statements of identity. But he\nargued that when the terms flanking the sign of identity were what he\ncalled rigid designators, an identity statement, if true at all, had to\nbe necessarily true, but need not be knowable a priori, as an\nanalytic truth would be. Connectedly, Kripke argued that identity and\ndistinctness were themselves necessary relations: if an object is\nidentical with itself it is necessarily so, and if it is distinct from\nanother it is necessarily so. \n\nKripke’s arguments were very persuasive, but there are examples that\nsuggest that his conclusion is too sweeping – that even identity\nstatements containing rigid designators can be, in a sense, contingent.\nThe debate over contingent identity is concerned with the assessment\nand proper analysis of these examples. \n\nOne of the earliest examples is provided by Gibbard (1975). Consider\na statue, Goliath, and the clay, Lumpl, from which it is composed.\nImagine that Lumpl and Goliath coincide in their spatiotemporal extent.\nIt is tempting to conclude that they are identical. But they might not\nhave been. Goliath might have been rolled into a ball and destroyed;\nLumpl would have continued to exist. The two would have been distinct.\nThus it seems that the identity of Lumpl and Goliath, if admitted, must\nbe acknowledged as merely contingent. \n\nOne reaction to this argument available to the convinced Kripkean is\nsimply to deny that Lumpl and Goliath are identical. But to accept\nthis is to accept that purely material entities, like statues and\nlumps of clay, of admittedly identical material constitution at all\ntimes, may nonetheless be distinct, though distinguished only by\nmodal, dispositional or counterfactual properties. To many, however,\nthis seems highly implausible, which provides the strength of the\nargument for contingent identity. Another way of thinking of this\nmatter is in terms of the failure of the supervenience of the\nmacroscopic on the microscopic. If Lumpl is distinct from Goliath then\na far distant duplicate of Lumpl, Lumpl*, coincident with a statue\nGoliath*, though numerically distinct from Goliath will\nbe microscopically indistinguishable from Goliath\nin all general respects, relational as well as\nnon-relational, past and future as well as present, even modal and\ndispositional as well as categorical, but will\nbe macroscopically distinguishable in general respects, since\nit will not be a statue, and will have modal properties, such as the\ncapacity to survive radical deformation in shape, which no statue\npossesses. \n\nDavid Lewis (in “Counterparts of Persons and their\nBodies”, 1971) suggests that the identity of a person with his\nbody (assuming the person and the body, like Goliath and Lumpl, are at\nall times coincident) is contingent, since bodily interchange is a\npossibility. He appeals to counterpart theory, modified to allow a\nvariety of counterpart relations, to explain this. Contingent identity\nthen makes sense, since “I and my body might not have been\nidentical” now translates into counterpart theory as\n“There is a possible world, w, a unique personal\ncounterpart\nx in w of me and a unique bodily counterpart\ny in w of my body, such that x and y\nare not identical”. \n\nWhat is crucial to making sense of contingent identity is an\nacceptance that modal predicates are inconstant in denotation (that\nis, stand for different properties when attached to different singular\nterms or different quantifying expressions). Counterpart theory\nprovides one way of explaining this inconstancy, but is not\nnecessarily the only way (Gibbard 1975, Noonan 1991, 1993). However,\nwhether the examples of contingent identity in the literature are\npersuasive enough to make it reasonable to accept the certainly\ninitially surprising idea that modal predications are inconstant in\ndenotation is still a matter of considerable controversy. \n\nFinally, in this section, it is worth noting explicitly the\ninterdependence of the topics under discussion: only if the possibility\nof contingent identity is secured, by counterpart theory or some other\naccount of de re modality which does not straightforwardly\nanalyse de re modal predication in terms of identity across\npossible worlds, can perdurance theory (or stage theory) as an account\nof identity across time be sustained against the modal arguments of\nWiggins, Thomson and van Inwagen. \n\nA thesis that has a long pedigree but has only recently been gathering\nattention in the contemporary literature is the “Composition as\nIdentity” thesis. The thesis comes in a weak and a strong\nform. In its weak form the thesis is that the mereological composition\nrelation is analogous in a number of important ways to the identity\nrelation and so deserves to be called a kind of identity. In\nits strong form the thesis is that the composition relation is\nstrictly identical with the identity relation, viz. that the parts of\na whole are literally (collectively) identical with the whole\nitself. The strong thesis was considered by Plato in\nParmenides and versions of the thesis have been discussed by\nmany historical figures since (Harte 2002, Normore and Brown\n2014). The progenitor of the modern version of the thesis is Baxter\n(1988a, 1988b, 2001) but it is most often discussed under the\nformulation of it given by Lewis (1991), who first considers the\nstrong thesis before rejecting it in favour of the weak thesis.  Both the strong and the weak versions of the thesis are motivated\nby the fact that there is an especially intimate relation between a\nwhole and its parts (a whole is “nothing over and above”\nits parts), buttressed by claims that identity and composition are\nalike in various ways. Lewis (1991: 85) makes five likeness\nclaims: \n\nClearly not all will agree with each of Lewis’s likeness\nclaims. Anyone who denies unrestricted mereological composition, for\nexample, will deny 2. And the defender of strong pluralism in the\nmaterial constitution debate (i.e. one who defends the view that there\ncan be all-time coincident entities) will deny 3. And some\nendurantists who think that ordinary material objects can have\ndistinct parts at distinct times will deny 5. But there is a more\ngeneral problem with 1, as van Inwagen has made clear (1994:\n213). Consider a world w1 that contains just two simples s1 and\ns2. Now consider the difference between someone p1 who believes that\ns1 and s2 compose something and someone p2 who does not. Ask: how many\nobjects do p1 and p2 believe there to be in w1? The answer, it seems,\nis that p1 believes that there are three things and p2 only two. So\nhow can a commitment to the existence of fusions be ontologically\ninnocent? One recent suggestion is that although a commitment to the\nexistence of fusions is not ontologically innocent, it almost\nis: to commit oneself to fusions is to commit oneself to further\nentities, but because they are not fundamental entities they are not\nones that matter for the purpose of theory choice (Cameron 2014,\nSchaffer 2008, Williams 2010, and see also Hawley 2014). \n\nIf one believes Lewis’s likeness claims one will be tempted by at\nleast the weak Composition as Identity thesis. If composition is a\ntype of identity this gives some kind of explanation of why the\nparallels between the two hold. But the strong thesis, that the\ncomposition relation is the identity relation, gives a fuller\nexplanation. So why not hold the strong thesis? Because, many think,\nthere are additional challenges that face anyone who wishes to defend\nthe strong thesis.  The classical identity relation is one that can only have single\nobjects as relata (as in: “George Orwell = Eric\nBlair”). If we adopt a language that allows the formation of\nplural terms we can unproblematically define a plural identity\nrelation that holds between pluralities of objects too. Plural\nidentity statements such as “the hunters are identical with the\ngatherers” are understood to mean that for all x,\nx is one of the hunters iff x is one of the\ngatherers. But, according to the strong Composition as Identity\nthesis, there can also be true hybrid identity statements that relate\npluralities and single objects. That is, sentences such as “the\nbricks = the wall” are taken by the defender of strong\nComposition as Identity to be well-formed sentences that express\nstrict identities. The first challenge facing the defender of the strong thesis is the\nleast troublesome. It is the syntactic problem that hybrid identity\nstatements are ungrammatical in English (Van Inwagen, 1994:\n211). Whilst “George Orwell is identical with Eric Blair”\nand “the hunters are identical with the gatherers” are\nwell-formed, it seems that “the bricks are identical with the\nwall” is not. However, there is in fact some doubt about whether\nhybrid identity statements are ungrammatical in English, and some have\npointed out that this is anyway a mere grammatical artefact of English\nthat is not present in other languages (e.g. Norwegian and\nHungarian). So it seems that the most this challenge calls for is a\nmild form of grammatical revisionism. And we have, at any rate, formal\nlanguages that allow hybrid constructions to be made in which to\nexpress the claims made by the defender of the strong Composition as\nIdentity thesis. (Sider 2007, Cotnoir 2013) (NB The claims regarding\nNorwegian and Hungarian are to be found in these two papers.)  The second challenge is more troublesome. It is the semantic\nproblem of providing coherent truth-conditions for hybrid identity\nstatements. The standard way to provide the truth-conditions for the\nclassical identity relation is to say that an identity statement of\nthe form “a=b” is true iff\n“a” and “b” have the same\nreferents. But this account clearly does not work for hybrid identity\nstatements, for there is no (single) referent for a plural\nterm. Moreover, the standard way of giving the truth-conditions for\nplural identity statements (mentioned above) does not work for hybrid\nidentity statements either. To say that “x is one of\nthe ys” is to say that x is (classically)\nidentical with one of the things in the plurality, i.e., that x\nis identical with\ny1, or identical with y2…\nor identical with yn. But then “the\nbricks = the wall” is true only if the wall is (classically)\nidentical with one of the bricks, i.e. with b1, or\nwith b2… or with bn,\nwhich it isn’t.  The third challenge is the most troublesome of all. In section 2\nit was noted that Leibniz’s Law (and its contrapositive) appear to be\ncrucial to our understanding of identity and distinctness. But it\nseems that the defender of strong Composition as Identity must deny\nthis. After all, the bricks are many, but the wall is one. The onus is\nthus on the defender of strong Composition as Identity to explain why\nwe should think the “are” in hybrid identity statements\nreally expresses the relation of identity. \n\nThe second and the third challenges have been thought by many to be\ninsurmountable (Lewis, for example, rejects strong Composition as\nIdentity on the basis of them). But, in recent semantic work in this\narea, accounts have emerged that promise to answer both\nchallenges. (Wallace 2011a, 2011b, Cotnoir 2013). Whether they do so,\nhowever, remains to be seen. Like the impossibility of contingent identity, the impossibility of\nvague identity appears to be a straightforward consequence of the\nclassical concept of identity (Evans 1978, see also Salmon 1982). For\nif a is only vaguely identical with b, something is\ntrue of it – that it is only vaguely identical with b\n– that is not true of b, so, by Leibniz’s Law, it is not\nidentical with b at all. Of course, there are vague statements\nof identity – “Princeton is Princeton Borough” (Lewis\n1988) – but the conclusion appears to follow that such vagueness\nis only possible when one or both of the terms flanking the sign of\nidentity is an imprecise designator. Relatedly, it appears to follow\nthat identity itself must be a determinate relation. \n\nBut some examples suggest that this conclusion is too sweeping\n– that even identity statements containing precise designators\nmay be, in some sense, indeterminate. Consider Everest and some\nprecisely defined hunk of rock, ice and snow, Rock, of which it is\nindeterminate whether its boundaries coincide with those of Everest. It\nis tempting to think that “Everest” and “Rock”\nare both precise designators (if “Everest” is not, is\nanything? (Tye 2000)) and that “Everest is Rock” is\nnonetheless in some sense indeterminate. \n\nThose who take this view have to respond to Evans’s original argument,\nabout which there has been intense debate (see separate article on\nvagueness, Edgington 2000, Lewis 1988, Parsons 2000, van Inwagen 1990,\nWilliamson 2002 and 2003), but also to more recent variants. There is\nno space to go into these matters here, but one particular variant of\nthe Evans argument worth briefly noting is given by Hawley\n(2001). Alpha and Omega are (two?) people, the first of whom steps\ninto van Inwagen’s (1990) fiendish cabinet which disrupts whatever\nfeatures are relevant to personal identity, and the second of whom\nthen steps out: \n\n(2) Alpha is such that it is indeterminate whether she steps out of\nthe cabinet \n\n(3) It is not indeterminate whether Omega steps out of the\ncabinet \n\n(4) Omega is not such that it is indeterminate whether she steps out\nof the cabinet \n\n(5) Alpha is not identical to Omega. \n\nThis argument differs from the standard version of Evans’s argument\nby not depending upon identity-involving properties (e.g. being such\nthat it is indeterminate whether she is Omega) to establish\ndistinctness, and this removes some sources of controversy. Others, of\ncourse, remain. \n\nThe debate over vague identity is too vast to survey here, but to\nfinish we can relate this debate to the previously discussed debate\nabout identity over time. \n\nFor some putative cases of vagueness in synchronic identity it seems\nreasonable to accept the conclusion of Evans’s argument and locate the\nindeterminacy in language (see the “Reply” by Shoemaker in\nShoemaker and Swinburne 1984 for the following example). A structure\nconsists of two halls, Alpha Hall and Beta Hall, linked by a flimsy\nwalkway, Smith is located in Alpha Hall, Jones in Beta Hall. The nature\nof the structure is such that the identity statement “The\nbuilding in which Smith is located is the building in which Jones is\nlocated” is neither true nor false because it is indeterminate\nwhether Alpha Hall and Beta Hall count as two distinct buildings or\nmerely as two parts of one and the same building. Here it is absolutely\nclear what is going on. The term “building” is vague in a\nway that makes it indeterminate whether it applies to the whole\nstructure or just to the two halls. Consequently, it is indeterminate\nwhat “the building in which Smith is located” and\n“the building in which Jones is located” denote. \n\nPerdurance theorists, who assimilate identity over time to identity\nover space, can accommodate vagueness in identity over time in the same\nway. In Hawley’s example they can say that there are several entities\npresent: one that exists before and after the identity-obscuring\noccurrences in the cabinet, one that exists only before, and one that\nexists only after. It is indeterminate which of these is a person and\nso it is indeterminate what the singular terms “Alpha” and\n“Omega” refer to. \n\nThis involves taking on an ontology that is larger than we\nordinarily recognise, but that is not uncongenial to the perdurance\ntheorist, who is happy to regard any, however spatiotemporally\ndisconnected, region as containing a physical object (Quine\n1960:171). \n\nBut what of endurance theorists? \n\nOne option for them is to adopt the same response and to accept a\nmultiplicity of entities partially coinciding in space and time where\nto common sense there seems to be only one. But this is to give up on\none of the major advantages claimed by the endurance theorist, his\nconsonance with common sense. \n\nThe endurance theorist has several other options. He may simply deny\nthe existence of the relevant entities and restrict his ontology to\nentities which are not complex; he may insist that any change destroys\nidentity so that in a strict and philosophical sense Alpha is distinct\nfrom Omega; or he may reject the case as one of vagueness, insisting\nthat, though we do not know the answer, either Alpha is Omega or she is\nnot. \n\nHowever, the most tempting option for the endurance theorist, which\nkeeps closest to common sense, is to accept that the case is one of\nvagueness, deny the multiplicity of entities embraced by the perdurance\ntheorist and reject Evans’s argument against vague identity. \n\nThat this is so highlights the fact that there is no easy solution\nto the problem consonant in every respect with common sense. Locating\nthe vagueness in language requires us to acknowledge a multiplicity of\nentities of which we would apparently otherwise have to take no notice.\nWhilst locating it in the world requires an explanation of how,\ncontrary to Evans’s argument, the impossibility of vague identity is\nnot a straightforward consequence of the classical conception of\nidentity, or else the abandonment of that conception.","contact.mail":"benjamin.curtis@ntu.ac.uk","contact.domain":"ntu.ac.uk"}]
