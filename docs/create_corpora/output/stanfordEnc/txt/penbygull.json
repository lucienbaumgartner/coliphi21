Among the\nauthors who followed his doctrines (the so called Oxford Realists),\nWilliam Penbygull (+1420) was almost certainly the most faithful to\nthe master, since his extant writings appear to be essentially devoted\nto a defence and/or explanation of Wyclif's main philosophical theses.\nNotwithstanding such an attitude, Penbygull made an original\ncontribution to logic by developing a new theory of identity, which\nsolved the problems that Wyclif's analysis of predication had raised,\nand by refining Wyclif's theory of predication itself. \n\nThe information on the life and works of William Penbygull (or\nPenbegyll) is scanty. He was from Exeter diocese; he studied at\nOxford, where he was fellow of Exeter College in 1399, and rector in\n1406–07. He was licensed to preach in the diocese of Bath and\nWells on 28 February 1410. He probably died at Oxford in 1420.\nAccording to Emden 1957–59, he wrote the following treatises on\nlogic: De universalibus (On Universals), Divisio\nentis (The Division of Being), and Super Porphyrii\nIsagogen (On Porphyry's Isagoge).  \nThe starting point of Penbygull’s theories on universals and\npredication are those worked out by Wyclif and one of his Oxford\nfollowers of the generation leading up to Penbygull: Robert\nAlyngton. \nAs is well known, Wyclif presents his opinion on universals as\nintermediate between those of Thomas Aquinas and Giles of Rome, on the\none side, and Walter Burley, on the other (see the entry on \n Wyclif). \nLike Giles Wyclif recognizes three main kinds of\nuniversals: (1) ideal universals, which are the ideas in God and\narchetypes of all that is; (2) formal universals, which are the common\nnatures shared by individual things; and (3) intentional universals,\nwhich are the mental signs by which we refer to the formal universals,\nor universals in re. On the other hand, like Burley, Wyclif\nholds that formal universals exist outside our minds in actu\nand not in potentia, even if, unlike Burley, he maintains\nthat they are really identical with their own individuals (De enti\nin communi, ch. 5. p. 58). More precisely, universals and\nindividuals are really the same but formally distinct, since they\nshare the same empirical reality, which is that of individuals, but if\nconsidered as universals and individuals, they have opposite\nconstituent principles: the generality or\nnatural-tendency-to-be-common for universals, and the thisness or\nimpossibility-of-being-common for individuals (see Tractatus de\nuniversalibus, ch. 2, pp. 62-63, ch. 4, pp. 86-87; ch. 10, pp.\n208-13). \nThis description of the logical relationship between universals and\nindividuals entailed the possibility of an indirect inherence of an\naccidental form in a substantial universal and of a second intention\nin any other. Therefore in the Tractatus de universalibus\nWyclif distinguished three main types of real predication in order to\nguarantee such possibilities: formal predication (praedicatio\nformalis), predication by essence (praedicatio secundum\nessentiam), and habitudinal predication (praedicatio secundum\nhabitudinem). These three kinds of predication are described by\nhim as three non-mutually exclusive ways of predicating, each more\ngeneral than the preceding (Tractatus de universalibus, ch.\n1, p. 35), but it is evident that habitudinal predication does not\nrequire any kind of identity between the entities signified by the\nsubject and predicate terms in the same way as formal predication and\nessential predication do. Formal predication is that in which the form\ndesignated by the predicate-term is directly present in the entity\nsignified by the subject- term. Predication by essence (note that in\nthis expression the term ‘essence’ has Wyclif’s technical\nmeaning of real entity with a given nature—see the entry on\n Wyclif) \nis that in which the same empirical reality is both\nthe real subject and predicate, even though the formal principle\nconnoted by the predicate-term differs from that connoted by the\nsubject-term. ‘God is man’ and ‘The universal is\nparticular’ are instances of this kind of predication. Finally,\nhabitudinal predication is that in which the form connoted by the\npredicate-term does not inhere, directly or indirectly (namely, not by\nitself but by means of something that is directly present in the thing\nsignified by the subject-term), in the essence designated by the\nsubject but simply implies a relation to it, so that the same\npredicate may be at different times said truly or falsely of its\nsubject without any change in the subject itself (Tractatus de\nuniversalibus, ch. 1, p. 34). According to Wyclif, we use such\npredication mainly to express theological truths, such as God is known\nand loved by many creatures or brings about, as efficient, exemplar,\nand final cause many good effects. \nAs we have seen, the ontological presuppositions of the most general\ntype of predication differ completely from those of the other two\ntypes by which it is implied. The final result of Wyclif’s\nchoices was therefore an incompletely developed system of intensional\nlogic that he superimposed on the traditional system. Because the\nontological basis of the most general type of predication, namely\nhabitudinal predication, is completely different from those of the\nother two types of predication that should imply it, Alyngton and\nother Oxford authors of the subsequent generation tried to improve\nWyclif’s theory by excluding habitudinal predication and\nredefining the other two kinds in a slightly different way. \nAccording to Alyngton, who depends on Avicenna and Wyclif on this\ntopic, the formal universals are common natures in virtue of which the\nindividuals that share them are exactly what they are, just as\nhumanity is the form by which every man formally is a man. Unlike\nWyclif, however, he does not think that universals exist in\nactu in the external world (see Alyngton, Litteralis\nsententia super Praedicamenta Aristotelis., ch. de\nsubstantia, in A.D. Conti, \"Linguaggio e realtà nel\ncommento alle Categorie di Robert Alyngton,\" Appendix\n(provisional edition of part of Alyngton's commentary on the\nCategories), Documenti e studi sulla tradizione\nfilosofica medievale, 4 (1993): 179-306, at p. 279). As natures,\nthey are prior and indifferent to any division into universals and\nindividuals. Although universality is not a constitutive mark of the\nnature itself, it is its unique, inseparable property. Also for\nAlyngton, universals are really identical-to and formally\ndistinct-from their individuals. In fact, universals are formal causes\nin relation to their own individuals, while individuals are material\ncauses in relation to their universals (see Litteralis sententia\nsuper Praedicamenta Aristotelis., ch. de substantia, pp.\n275-76). On this basis, Alyngton stated that (1) a universal in the\ncategory of substance can directly receive only the predications of\nsubstantial forms more common than it. So, for instance, only\ncorporeity and animality can be directly predicated\nof humanity. And (2) the accidental forms inhering in\nindividual substances can be predicated of the universal substantial\nform that those individuals instantiate only indirectly (or\nessentialiter according to his terminology) through and in\nvirtue of the individuals themselves of that substantial form (see\nLitteralis sententia super Praedicamenta Aristotelis., ch.\nde substantia, pp. 288-89). For instance, the general form of\nwhiteness can be indirectly predicated of the general form of\nhumanity in virtue of the individual forms of\nwhiteness which inhere in individual men. \nFor this reason, Alyngton’s description of the logical structure\nof the relationship between universals and individuals demanded a\nredefinition of predication. Indeed, he was the first one to\nameliorate Wyclif ’s theory by dividing predication into\n(1)formal predication (praedicatio formalis) and (2) remote\ninherence (inhaerentia remota)—or, in other words,\npredication by essence (praedicatio secundum essentiam).\nRemote inherence is grounded on a partial identity between subject and\npredicate, which share some, but not all, metaphysical constituents,\nand does not demand that the form signified by the predicate-term be\ndirectly present in the entity signified by the subject-term. On the\ncontrary, such a direct presence is required by formal predication.\n‘Man is an animal’ and ‘Socrates is white’ are\ninstances of formal predication; ‘(What is) singular is (what\nis) common’ (‘singulare est commune’) and\n‘Humanity is (something) running’ (‘humanitas\nest currens’) are instances of remote inherence, since,\naccording to Alyngton, the property of running is imputable to the\nform of humanity, if at least one man is running. He is careful,\nhowever, to use a substantival adjective in its neuter form as a\npredicate-term, because only in this way can it appear that the form\nsignified by the predicate-term is not directly present in the\nsubject, but is indirectly attributed to it through its individuals\n(see Litteralis sententia super Praedicamenta Aristotelis.,\nch. de substantia, p. 289—see the entry on \n Alyngton). \nLike many other Oxford Realists, Penbygull lists three main kinds of\nuniversals: (i) the metaphysical causes of everything, like God and\nthe angelic intelligences; (ii) the general concepts abstracted by our\nmind, or mental universals; and (iii) the common natures existing in\nthe singulars, or real universals (De universalibus, p. 178).\nSuch common natures are type-forms naturally apt to be present-in and\npredicated-of a set of individuals, which therefore instantiate them.\nReal universals are the main metaphysical components of the\nindividuals, but they have no being outside the being of their\nindividuals, as universals and their individuals are really\n(realiter) the same and only formally (formaliter)\ndistinct (De universalibus, p. 189). In fact, real universals\nare identical with their own individuals when considered as natures of\na certain kind (for instance, man is the same thing as Socrates), but\ndifferent from them when considered qua universals and\nqua individuals respectively, because of the opposite\nconstitutive principles: generality for universals and thisness for\nindividuals (De universalibus, p. 181).  \nLike Walter Burley and Wyclif, Penbygull holds that such formal\nuniversals exist in act (in actu) outside our minds, and not\nin potency (in potentia) only, as moderate realists (like St.\nThomas Aquinas) thought, since for Penbygull the necessary and\nsufficient condition that a thing must meet for being a universal is\nthe existence of at least one individual in which it is present\n(De universalibus, p. 178). So the actual existence of\nuniversals depends entirely on that of their individuals; without\nthem, common natures could not be really universals. \nOn the logical side, this description of the relationship between\nuniversals and individuals in terms of real identity and formal\ndistinction, entails that not all that is predicated of individuals\ncan be directly (formaliter) attributed to their\nuniversals and vice versa. In particular, the accidental\nforms inhering in substantial individuals (for instance, the whiteness\ninhering in Socrates) can be predicated of the universal forms proper\nto these individuals (for instance, the form of humanity or that of\nanimality) only indirectly (essentialiter), through\nand in virtue of the individuals themselves. As a consequence, a\nredefinition of the standard kinds predication and the introduction of\na new type, unknown to Aristotle, was required, in order to cover the\ncases of indirect inherence of an accidental form in a substantial\nuniversal, admitted by this theory. \nPenbygull, like other Oxford logicians of his generation, tried to\nimprove Wyclif's theory by excluding habitudinal predication and\nredefining the other two kinds in a slightly different way. Penbygull\ntherefore divides predication (which he conceives as a real relation\nwhich holds between metaphysical objects [De universalibus,\np. 188]) into formal predication (praedicatio formalis),\npredication by essence (secundum essentiam), and causal\npredication. Predication by essence shows a partial identity between\nsubject and predicate, which share some, but not all, metaphysical\ncomponent parts, and does not require that the form connotated by the\npredicate-term be directly present in the essence denotated by the\nsubject-term. Formal predication, on the contrary, requires such a\ndirect presence. If the form connotated by the predicate-term is\nintrinsic to the nature of the subject, then the predication is a case\nof formal essential predication, while if it is extrinsic, the\npredication is a case of formal accidental predication. “Man is\nan animal” is an instance of formal essential predication;\n“Socrates is white” is an instance of formal accidental\npredication. Unlike Wyclif, who applied predication by essence to\nsecond intentions only—since he admitted sentences like\n“(What is) universal is (what is) singular” (that is,\nuniversale est singulare) as well-formed and\ntrue—Penbygull thinks that it holds also when applied to first\nintentions. So he claims that it is possible to predicate of the\nuniversal-man (homo in communi) the property of being white,\nif at least one of its individuals is white. However he makes sure to\nuse as a predicate-term a substantival adjective in its neuter form,\nbecause only in this way can it appear that the form connoted by the\npredicate-term is not directly present in the subject, but is\nindirectly attributed to it, through its individuals. Therefore he\nacknowledges the proposition “The universal-man is (something)\nwhite” (homo in communi est album) as a true one, if at\nleast one of the existing men is white (De universalibus, pp.\n186–87). Finally, there is causal predication when the item\nsignified by the predicate-term is not present in any way in the item\nsignified by the subject-term, but the real subject has been caused by\nthe real predicate (De universalibus, p. 188). \nAccording to him formal essential predication and formal accidental\npredication would correspond to Aristotle's essential and accidental\npredication. But, as a matter of fact, he agrees with Wyclif in\nregarding predication by essence as more general than formal\npredication. As a consequence, in his theory formal predication is a\nparticular type of predication by essence. This means that he\nimplicitly recognizes a single ontological pattern, founded on a sort\nof partial identity, as the basis of every kind of standard\nphilosophical statement (subject, copula, predicate). But in this way,\nformal essential predication and formal accidental predication are\nvery different from their Aristotelian models, as they express degrees\nof identity as well as predication by essence. \nFormal accidental predication is then further divided into\nsecundum motum and secundum habitudinem (De\nuniversalibus, pp. 187–88). The basic idea of this last\ndivision seems to be that modes of being and natures of the accidental\nforms determine the set of substantial items which can play the role\nof their substrate. Penbygull distinguishes between those accidental\nforms that require a substance capable of undergoing change (per\nse mobile) as their own direct substrate of inherence, and those\nwhich do not need a substrate with such a characteristic. Forms like\nquantity, whiteness, alteration, diminution and so on belong to the\nfirst group, while relations of reason and respectus, like\ncausation, difference, and so on, fall under the second one. The forms\nof the first group bring about formal accidental predication\nsecundum motum, and the forms of the second group formal\naccidental predication secundum habitudinem. The former\nnecessarily entail singular substances as their substrates, since\nindividuals alone can undergo change, while the latter can directly\ninhere in both individual and universal substances (insunt\ndenominative tam communibus quam singularibus—De\nuniversalibus, p. 188). \nThis interpretative scheme of the nature and kinds of predication is\nultimately grounded on a notion of identity, necessarily different\nfrom the standard one. According to the most common opinion the\nlogical criteria for identity and (real) distinction were the\nfollowing:  \na differs from (is [really] distinct from) b iff\nthere is at least one z such that a is predicated of\nz and b is not, or vice versa, or there is\nat least one w such that w is predicated of\na and not of b, or vice versa. \nOn this basis one can easily conclude that universals and individuals\ncan never be the same, at least because of the forms of generality\n(which cannot be predicated of individuals) and of thisness (which\ncannot be predicated of universals). So Penbygull had to put forward\nnew criteria for identity and distinction. First of all, he\ndistinguishes between the notion of non-identity and that of\ndifference (or distinction) and denies that the notion of difference\nimplies that of non-identity (De universalibus, p. 190); then\nhe affirms that the two notions of difference and (real) identity are\nlogically compatible (ibid.); finally he suggests the\nfollowing definitions for these three notions non-identity, difference\nor distinction, and (absolute) identity (De universalibus,\npp. 190–91): \na differs from b iff there is at least one form\nF such that F is directly present in\na but not in b or vice versa; \na is (absolutely) identical with b if and only if\nfor any form F, F is present in a iff it is\npresent in the same way in b. \nThe criterion for non-identity is stronger than the common one for\nreal distinction: two things can be qualified as non-identical iff\nthey belong to distinct categories. On the other side, the definition\nof difference does not exclude the possibility that two things which\ndiffer from each other share one or more properties (or forms). Thus,\nthere are degrees of distinction, and what is more, the degree of\ndistinction between two things can be read as the inverse measure of\ntheir (partial) identity. For instance, if we compare the list of the\nforms (both substantial and accidental) which constitute Socrates and\nthose which make up the universal-man, it is evident that Socrates and\nthe universal-man differ from each other, since there are forms which\ndirectly inhere in Socrates and not in the universal-man and vice\nversa; but it is also evident that the two lists are identical\nfor a long section, that is, that Socrates and the universal-man,\nconsidered from the point of view of their metaphysical composition,\nare partially the same. As a result, the copula of the propositions\nwhich Penbygull deals with cannot be extensionally interpreted, as it\ndoes not mean that a given object is a member of a certain set, nor\nthat a given set is included in another, but it always means degrees\nin identity between two compound entities.","contact.mail":"alessandro.conti@cc.univaq.it","contact.domain":"cc.univaq.it"}]
