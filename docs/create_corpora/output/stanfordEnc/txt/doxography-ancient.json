But this loss is made good to some extent not\nonly by quotations from lost works recorded by later writers, but also\nby the varieties of ancient reportage that are extant. The modern name\nfor these forms of reportage is ‘doxography’, which could\nbe be translated ‘tenet-writing’. Broadly speaking,\ndoxography encompasses those writings, or parts of writings, in which\nthe author presents philosophical views of some or other of the\nancient philosophers or schools, in some or other areas, or on some or\nother topics, of philosophy, whether with or without presentation of\nthe argumentation or analysis through which they offered philosophical\nsupport or reasons in favor of their ‘tenets’, and whether\nor not they also include critical evaluations and comments of the\nauthor's own. In other words, these are works (or sections of works)\ntaking as their subject matter the tenets or doctrines of the\nphilosophers, rather than independent works of philosophy in which the\nauthor addresses in the first instance issues or topics of philosophy,\nwith ancillary discussion along the way of the opinions of other\nphilosophers. The terms for tenets, or views, in ancient Greek are\ndoxai or dogmata, in Latin opiniones; those\nfor doctrines are, in Greek, areskonta, translated into Latin\nas placita. But note that these designations were used\ninterchangeably.\n\nThe term ‘doxography’ has come to be applied in a much\nlarger sense than seems to have been intended by its creator Hermann\nDiels. This name for the genre, if we may misleadingly call it that,\nderives from the Latin neologism ‘doxographi’ used by\nDiels to indicate the authors of a rather strictly specified type of\nliterature studied and edited in his monumental Doxographi\nGraeci (‘Greek Doxographers’) of 1879. His researches\nwere focused on writings concerned with the physical part of\nphilosophy (including principles, theology, cosmology, astronomy,\nmeteorology, biology and part of medicine). But today overviews in the\nfield of ethics are also called doxographical. And scholars speak of\n‘doxographies’ to be found in the dialogues of Plato and\nthe treatises of Aristotle, although these are works in which issues\nof philosophy are addressed, with only ancillary discussion of the\nviews of others. \nThe following authors and main works, listed in chronological order,\nare representative of doxography in the broad as well as in\nthe narrower sense (a complete list of names and titles would\nbe\n impractical).[1] \nCicero, 1st c. BCE: one of our indispensable sources for (the debates\namong the) schools of Hellenistic philosophy, esp. Stoicism,\nEpicureanism, and Academic Skepticism: Academics (book two\ndeals with questions of epistemology from Stoic and Academic Skeptic\nangles); On the Chief Ends of Good and Evil; On the\nNature of the Gods (contrasting Epicurean and Stoic views on\nnature and the gods and criticizing them from the viewpoint of\nmoderate Skepticism); On Fate (hellenistic arguments pro and\ncontra determinism); On Duties (largely based on a treatise\nof the Middle Stoic Panaetius). (Broad) \nPhilodemus, 1st c. BCE: works more or less extant on charred papyrus\nscrolls: Arrangement of the Philosophers, esp. two books\ndealing with the Academic and Stoic schools from an institutional\nangle; also a polemical treatise On the Stoics. A section\nfrom his On Piety briefly dealing with the tenets of the\nphilosophers about the gods is closely parallel to a section in book\none of Cicero’s On the Nature of the Gods; both\npassages printed in parallel columns in Diels 1879.\n(Broad) \nPs-Plutarch, 2nd c. CE: Placita (‘tenets’,\n‘doctrines’) dealing with physics in five books ranging\nfrom first principles to diseases and old age. Issues in physical\nphilosophy are presented in chapters which (as a rule) contrast the\ntenets of the philosophers and occasionally of some physicians and\nastronomers, in a systematic not a chronological sequence. As a rule\neach individual tenet is formulated in an extremely brief way. No\ninformation is provided about individuals later than 1st c. BCE. See\nbelow, section 2, on Aëtius’ Placita of which this\ntract is an epitome. Edited as left column of reconstructed\nAëtius in Diels 1879. (Narrow) \nArius Didymus, late 1st c. CE: smaller and larger fragments from works\ncited as On Schools, or as Abstract(s), in\ntheir present form mainly dealing with Stoic and Peripatetic physics\non the one hand (edited Diels\n 1879),[2]\n and Stoic and Peripatetic ethics (extant in Stobaeus, see below) on\nthe other. (Narrow) \nPlutarch, after 45 – after 120 CE: esp. polemical treatises\nagainst Epicureans and Stoics: That Epicurus Makes a Pleasant Life\nImpossible, Reply to Colotes, Is ‘Live\nUnknown’ a Wise Precept?, and On Stoic\nSelf-Contradictions, Against the Stoics on Common Conceptions.\n(Broad) \nClement of Alexandria, late 2nd c. CE, a Christian author:\nStromateis (‘Patchworks’), numerous passages\nadducing, and explaining, the views of poets and prose-writers,\nphilosophers and others, on a great variety of issues.\n(Broad) \nDiogenes Laërtius, early 3rd c. CE, indispensable for the history\nof Greek, esp. Hellenistic, philosophy: Lives and Maxims of Those\nwho Have Distinguished themselves in Philosophy and the Doctrines of\nEach Sect, in ten books. As the title shows this work offers a\nblend of biography and doxography. Lay-out is according to\nphilosophical schools: e.g., book seven gives the common\ndogmata of the Stoic school in the life of its founder.\nRanges from the Seven Sages and the Presocratics to the Hellenistic\nschools up to the 2nd – 1st c. BCE. (Broad) \nHippolytus, early 3rd c. CE, a Christian author, Refutation of All\nHeresies: important esp. as source for Presocratic doctrines (and\nfragments!) (Osborne 1987, Mansfeld 1992b). Book one edited Diels\n1879. (Narrow, more or less) \nPs-Galen, Philosophical History, date uncertain (3rd-5th c.\nCE?): mostly a sorry epitome of Ps-Plutarch Placita. Edited\nDiels 1879, in part Jas 2018. (Narrow) \nStobaeus, 5th c. CE: Anthology, of which in the first two\nbooks (Eclogae) among other invaluable excerpts chunks of\nAëtius (see below, section 2) are preserved; edited as right column\nfor Aëtius in Diels 1879, and also containing large and smaller\nabstracts from Arius Didymus (see above). (Broad) (Arius\nDidymus) and (narrow) (Aëtius). \nTheodoret, 5th c. CE, Christian bishop: Cure for the Diseases of\nthe Greeks, contains excerpts from Aëtius (see below,\nsection 2) quoted at bottom of Aëtian page in Diels 1879 and in\nMansfeld & Runia 2020. (Narrow) \nThe starting-point of Diels' (1879) inquiries was a hypothesis\nprovided by his Bonn teacher and Doktorvater Hermann Usener\n(who had predecessors himself), concerning the identical or closely\nsimilar language used in reports of pre-Socratic and other\nphilosophical doctrines contained in two late compendia, the\nPlacita (‘Tenets’) surviving among our\nmanuscripts of Plutarch, and the Eclogae of the anthologizer\nStobaeus; this hypothesis Diels modified in certain respects, and also\nmade much more complicated, as he attempted to trace back from\nps-Plutarch and Stobaeus a long line of predecessors, each\nsuccessively relied upon by later authors in compiling\nphilosophers’ doctrines, all the way down to ps-Plutarch and\nStobaeus themselves. In a truly magisterial way he gave it the aura of\nabsolute certainty and unassailability which did much to ensure its\ndominating position in the study of ancient philosophy until today.\nThe hypothesis may be briefly set out as follows. \nThe tradition of authors of works in the doxography of physics begins\nwith Aristotle’s pupil and successor Theophrastus. In the\ncatalogue of his oeuvre preserved in his Life in Diogenes\nLaertius a treatise is listed of ‘Physikôn\nDoxôn, sixteen books’. For the Greek title in the\nnominative one has a choice between Physikôn Doxai\n(‘Tenets of the Natural Philosophers’) and Physikai\nDoxai (‘Tenets in Natural Philosophy’). Usener and\nDiels opted for the first alternative, but in the opinion of many\nscholars today the second option is much more plausible. To this\ntreatise they attributed a number of fragments dealing with the\nprinciples (archai: Thales’ water, Heraclitus’\nfire, etc.) transmitted for the most part by Simplicius, a\nNeoplatonist commentator on Aristotle of the 6th c. CE. That\nSimplicius and others explicitly quote from Theophrastus’\nPhysics, a different treatise, did not bother them. They\nfurther posited that a short monograph of Theophrastus, the De\nSensibus, dealing with theories concerning the senses and their\nobjects from Parmenides to Democritus and Plato, is a fragment of this\ntreatise as well. The simple fact however that Plato, not first and\nforemost a philosopher of nature, is treated here on the same level as\nDemocritus and the other natural philosophers (as is also the case in\nthe fragments dealing with the principles) should have made them more\nhesitant, even within the scope of their own hypothesis, as to the\ninterpretation of the title of the foundational treatise in sixteen\nbooks.  \nThe Metarsiology attributed to Theophrastus, extant in Syrian\nand Arabic translation, was discovered and published too late to be\ntaken into account by Diels. Doubts about the attribution are\nformulated by Bakker 2016. For the text see Daiber 1992, and for the\nrelation to the Placita Mansfeld & Runia 2020,\n4.3.1135–37.  \nAccording to Diels’ revision of the hypothesis a number of\nextant writings (as well as sections of writings) concerned with\ndoctrines in the fields of natural philosophy ultimately derive from\nfrom the Physikôn Doxai (as he called the work), via several\nintermediary stages. These stages are:  \nThe Aëtius hypothesis was new; it has proved to be tenable,\nthough it has been shown to be in need of revision. Before Diels,\nscholars believed in the existence of a single early source, parts of\nwhich would have been taken over and adapted by Cicero as well as much\nlater by, for instance, ps-Galen. The Vetusta Placita\nhypothesis, on the other hand, is dubious, and the way back to\nTheophrastus is much more complicated and uncertain, if only because\nhard evidence is so scarce, than Diels, who just stuck to\nUsener’s point of view about Theophrastus, wished to consider.\n \nDiels next posited that Theophrastus’ treatise, the Vetusta\nPlacita, and Aëtius had the same kind of systematic lay-out\nas the extant Placita of ps-Plutarch, viz. according to\nsubject. The individual books and sections of books of this tract are\nindeed concerned with specific themes, such as for instance book two,\nwhich deals with the cosmos and the heavenly bodies. Within the\nframework of a section devoted to a particular subject, e.g., the sun,\nor the moon, the individual chapters may be concerned with various\nspecific issues pertaining to the sun, or the moon, and so on.  \nDiels further argued that other reports, in other authors, should also\nbe connected with Theophrastus’ foundational treatise. The\npassages dealing with the tenets of Presocratic philosophers in the\nhistory of philosophy by Diogenes Laërtius, which is arranged\naccording to schools and individuals, not subjects, as well as similar\nsections of the first book of Hippolytus’ Refutation of All\nHeresies and of the Stromateis\n(‘Patchworks’) of another ps-Plutarch, in Diels’\nview also went back, ultimately, to the Tenets of the Natural\nPhilosophers. He failed to take the difference between treatment\naccording to subject and that according to person, or school,\nsufficiently into account. His argumentation is also dubious in other\nrespects. From the undeniable fact that there are striking\nresemblances between Theophrastus’ fragments concerned with the\nprinciples on the one hand, and what is found on that score in\nAëtius, Diogenes Laërtius, and Hippolytus on the other, it\ndoes not follow that corresponding passages in these later authors for\nwhich we have no Theophrastean parallels derive from Theophrastus too.\nThis is source criticism, or Quellenforschung, at its most\nvulnerable. Diels moreover preferred to overlook the equally\nundeniable fact that Aristotle’s treatment of the principles in\nthe first book of the Metaphysics exhibits equally striking\ncorrespondences with Theophrastus’ fragments (Zeller 1877), and\nso with the later tradition as well, which could therefore go back\nultimately to Aristotle, and not to Theophrastus. \nDiels saw the development from Theophrastus to these later and (in his\nview) dependent authors as a decline, and a progressive obfuscation\nand deterioration. His cladistic reconstruction of the doxographical\ntradition is clearly related to the famous so-called\n‘Lachmannian’ stemma of a group of manuscripts, from later\ncopies to the lost common ancestor, or archetype, the text of which\n(as scholars believed at the time) may be reconstructed in a virtually\nmechanical way. Diels was very much aware of this analogy, which\nsurely was an important factor in convincing him and others that the\nsplendid results of his investigations were irrefutable. In the 19th\ncentury the method attributed to Lachmann was assumed to be beyond\ncriticism. \nBy thus (so to speak automatically) tracing back these mutually\ncorresponding passages in later authors to the, as he assumed,\nfaithful reporter Theophrastus, Diels believed he gained access to\nreliable information about Presocratic philosophy. Thanks to the\nstemmatic method back to the archetype it became possible to bestow\nupon a passage (a brief lemma in, for instance, Aëtius) dealing\nwith a tenet of a Presocratic philosopher, the conditional status of\nbeing an attestation which, though still at second hand, should be\nearly and therefore the more to be trusted. It is with the importance\nmeted out to such so-called ‘fragments’ that these\nlemmata, removed by Diels’ scissors from Aëtian chapters\ndealing with subjects, figure in the chronological series of\nchapters devoted to persons in two fundamental works he\npublished. These are the Poetarum Philosophorum Fragmenta\n(‘Fragments of the Poet-Philosophers’) of 1901, reprinted\n2000, and the famous, several times revised (in later editions by\nDiels’ collaborator Kranz), and often reprinted Fragmente\nder Vorsokratiker (‘Fragments of the Presocratics’,\nabbreviated D.-K.), first published in 1903. Scholars indeed still\ntend to view these Aëtian lemmata as a sort of Theophrastean\nfragments, and Theophrastus is believed to be a bona fide source. This\nalso holds for those passages in Hippolytus, Diogenes Laërtius\nand other authors in D.-K. which had been traced back to Theophrastus\nhypothetically. \nHowever, when one compares Aëtian lemmata concerned with tenets\nof extant authors, like Plato or Aristotle, with the doctrines found\nin the original texts, it becomes clear to what extent these\ndoxai have been adapted and distorted, or\n‘modernized’, in some sense of the word. This consequently\nshould also hold for lemmata dealing with lost authors, as Xylander\nalready pointed out in his 16th century edition of Plutarch, which\nincluded the Epitome of ps-Plutarch. (For further reading on\nthis topic, see Mansfeld & Runia 1997, and Runia 1999, 2004.) \nThe role of Theodoret as a source for Aëtius has been questioned\nand doubted by Lebedev 1983, Frede 1999, Gourinat 2011, and Bottler\n(2015). However, no one doubts that there must be a source PS shared\nby ps.Plutarch and Stobaeus. One can also prove that there must be\nsuch a source (TS) shared by Theodoret and Stobaeus. As a final step\none can prove that the PS source and the TS source cannot be\ndistinguished from each other so are identical. Thus Diels’\noriginal intuition is vindicated. For details see Mansfeld 2018 and\nsection 8 below. \nUsener’s influence is also the cause of a fatal blind spot in\nDiels. He failed to acknowledge that Theophrastus, too, had a sort of\nDoktorvater, namely Aristotle. Aristotle, in his treatises,\nas a rule lists and discusses the opinions (doxai) of men in\ngeneral and of the experts (who often are philosophers) in particular,\nconcerning an issue in metaphysics, or physics, or psychology, and\nsometimes ethics, before embarking on his own investigations. These\nopinions are ordered according to the method of diaeresis, or\ndivision: a classification according to sets, sub-sets and\nsub-sub-sets with specific differences. Aristotle checks to what\nextent these opinions are in agreement among themselves or contradict\neach other, and then tries to establish to what extent one of the\navailable options may prove acceptable, at least as the starting-point\nfor further inquiry, or whether some option may be available which\nothers have failed to consider. We call these exegetical and\nevaluative overviews ‘dialectical’, in the Aristotelian\nsense of the word of course. An overview of this nature should\nestablish which genus, or set, is at issue, that is to say\nwhether we are faced with a theoretical discipline, such as physics\n(and then with what species, or sub-set, e.g., zoology), or\nwith a non-theoretical discipline such as poetics. This approach\nshould also be applied to the sub-sets, or particular objects of\ninquiry, embraced by a particular sub-set. According to Posterior\nAnalytics 2.1 various aspects should (or may) be treated\nseparately, viz.: (1) does the object of the inquiry possess a\nparticular property or attribute, or not; (2) the reason why it does\npossess this attribute; (3) the existence or non-existence of the\nobject (for instance: do gods exist?—a question one does not\nneed to ask when humans, or the sun, are at issue); and (4), the\nsubstance or definition of the object. Here an important part is\nplayed by the Aristotelian so-called categories and other kinds of\npredicates, because it is of major importance to establish to what\ncategory (viz. substance, or quality, or quantity, or place, or doing\nand being-affected etc.) a given object of inquiry and/or its\nattributes belong, or whether and in what sense for instance motion\n(or rest) may be predicated of it. These four different primary\nquestions, or types of questions, may moreover be formulated in\nrespect of each category (viz., not only of substance, but also of\nquality, etc.). Take the objects of mathematics. According to\nAristotle these do not belong to the category of substance but to that\nof quantity. But within this latter category one may formulate\nquestions about properties, or attributes, which may belong to them;\nenquire whether they exist, and if so, in what way; ask whether they\nmove or not; and so on. \nIn his treatise on dialectic and its methods, the Topics\n(1.14), Aristotle provides instructions on how to select and classify\npropositions (protaseis) and problems\n(problêmata): \nWe should also make selections from the literature and include these\nin separate lists for each set, with separate headings, for instance\n‘On the Good’, or ‘On the Living\nBeing’—that is to say the Good as a whole, starting with\n(the question) ‘what is it?’ One should cite the\ndoxai [opinions, tenets] of individual thinkers, e.g., that\nEmpedocles said that the elements of bodies are four in number\n[…]. \nOf propositions and problems there are—to comprehend the matter\nin outline—three sets: some are ethical, others physical, others\nagain logical. Ethical: for instance (the problem) whether one should\nobey one’s parents or the law, when these disagree with each\nother. Logical: for instance (the problem) whether the knowledge of\nopposites is the same, or not. Physical: for instance (the problem)\nwhether the cosmos is eternal or not. \nConsequently, propositions and problems can be, and therefore in some\ncases should be, elucidated by means of tenets, or opinions:\ndoxai. As there are three sets of propositions, so there are\nthree sets of doxai: physical, ethical, and\n‘logical’ (i.e., general). An example of such a diaeresis,\nor division, of a sub-set which is of fundamental importance for\nAristotle is found at the beginning of his Physics. This\ndivision pertains to two categories and one predicate of a different\nsort: the number (category of quantity), nature (category of\nsubstance) and motion vs. rest (category of doing and being-affected)\nof the principles (archai) and elements (stoicheia)\nposited by Aristotle’s predecessors in the field of natural\nphilosophy. In line with the rule formulated in the Topics\nnames of philosophers are added to some of the doxai.\nNumerous other examples of this ingredient of the dialectical method\nare to be found in Aristotle’s writings. \nThe above-cited passage from the Topics, and\nAristotle’s general practice, help to determine and explain the\ntitle of the Theophrastean treatise Diels believed to be foundational:\nit should be Physikai Doxai, i.e., ‘Tenets in [the\nvarious fields of] Natural Philosophy’. And one of the rare\nextant fragments of this treatise not only proves (because of the\nformulation in Greek of the title as quoted) that this title really is\n‘Physical Tenets’, but also demonstrates that such tenets\nwere criticized according to the rules of dialectic. Theophrastus, we\nare informed, cited a tenet of Plato’s and then formulated\n‘the objections’ against it. The Greek word for\n‘objections’ found in this fragment, enstaseis,\nis a technical term in Aristotle’s Topics. Physical\ntenets are tenets, or theses, in the fields of natural philosophy in\nthe largest sense, ranging from the principles, via cosmology,\nastronomy and meteorology etc., to human psychology (including\nphilosophy of mind), biology, and even nosology or the theory of\ndiseases. Physical tenets are not only formulated by\nphysikoi, natural philosophers, but also by physicians and\nastronomers. Aëtius indeed contains a number of\n medical[4]\n and astronomical doxai, the oldest of which may derive from\nsources that can perhaps be attributed to some of Aristotle’s\ncollaborators. (For further reading on this topic, see Mansfeld 1990,\n1992, 1998, 2016a, Mansfeld & Runia 1997, Runia 1999a, Runia 2004,\nwith criticism in Zhmud 2001 and rejoinder in Mansfeld 2002.)  \nTheophrastus applies the diaeretic method in his treatise De\nSensibus. The chief division—already found in corresponding\npassages in Aristotle—is between those who posit that knowledge\nis to be ascribed to similarity (‘like knows like’) and\nthose who posit that it is to be ascribed to contrast (‘unlike\nknows unlike’). Another division, not paralleled in Aristotle,\nalso plays an important part in classifying and dialectically\ndiscussing the tenets, viz. between those who assume that there is a\ndifference between thinking and sense-perception, and those who do\nnot. Finally, within each class the philosophers are treated in a\nsequence determined by the number of senses that are posited (category\nof quantity). The last philosopher to be discussed is Democritus, not\nPlato. This is because Democritus according to Theophrastus assumes\nthat knowledge comes about through both similarity and contrast. \nThis presentation, viz. a division, or divisions, of contrasting\ntenets (names included) dealing with specific issues, followed by an\nexceptional (or compromise) view, which fails to fit this division, is\nnot a standard feature of Aristotle’s dialectical\noverviews. However we do find partial anticipations of this\nmethodology in Aristotle, e.g. in the second chapter of De\nAnima I he opposes three views concerned with the principles that\nconstitute the soul: some hold that these are corporeal, others that\nthey are incorporeal, while a third group posits a blend of corporeal\nand incorporeal principles. In Aristotle however we do not find the\nstrings of detailed sortings of individual tenets followed by a\ncompromise or maverick opinion typical of numerous Placita\nchapters, while Theophrastus’ presentation in the De\nSensibus is in this respect close to the Placita\nroutine.\n [5]\n Consequently, we may submit that it is Aristotle’s dialectical\nmethodology, as revised by Theophrastus, which determines the\nstructure of large sections of the Placita. It should be\nnoted, moreover, that the introduction of ps-Plutarch’s\nPlacita, that ‘according to Aristotle and Theophrastus\nand almost all the Peripatetics a perfect human being should devote\nhimself to problems in the fields of natural philosophy and\nethics’. \nTheophrastus and Aristotle, then, were used in this way. An\nexample: The chapters in Aëtius (Placita 3.9–15)\nand Cicero (Academics 2.122) dealing with a number of various\nand occasionally even bizarre views concerning the position, motion,\nshape, etc. of the earth in the last resort patently derive, as to\ntheir main themes and oppositions and even as to some telling details,\nfrom a chapter in Aristotle’s On the Heavens (2.13)\n(Mansfeld 1992). Cicero here mentions Theophrastus by name; he\ntherefore may well be involved too, as an intermediary source. But we\nhave no further evidence concerning his contribution in this\nparticular instance. \nIt is rather amazing that the great Diels, who clearly was aware of\nthe importance of the diaeretic method in Aristotle’s writings\nand in Theophrastus’ De Sensibus, failed to apply this\ninsight to the Placita literature. The diaphonic\norganization, moreover, of chapters containing tenets that are listed\naccording to criteria determined by various divisions obviously\ndetermines not only the presentation but also, to some extent, the\ncontents of the material. \nIt would seem that, just as is the case for Aristotle, also in that of\nTheophrastus more than one treatise provided material that ultimately\nfound a home in the Placita, namely at the very least the\nPhysikai Doxai, the Physics, the De\nsensibus, and the Metarsiology. \nWhen we inquire into the way ancient authors have used the information\nprovided by Aëtius’ Placita, by its progeny, and\nby its post-Theophrastean predecessors, we often find that the\nfunction of these collections of doxai is not much different\nfrom the functions of similar overviews in the context of\nAristotle’s dialectical discussions. The main objective of these\nauthors, who are in a position to base themselves on evidence that has\nalready been provided with a definite structure, is to ascertain\nwhether a given doxa may eventually prove to be useful, and\nwhich doxai should be rejected—depending, naturally, on\nthe point of view of the user (who may be a physician or a\nphilosopher, a Stoic or an Epicurean, a Platonist or an Aristotelian,\na pagan or a Christian). Sometimes all the doxai belonging to\na specific sub-set, or dealing with a specific theme, may turn out to\nbe unacceptable, or useless, under certain circumstances or to\nsomebody in particular. The fact should never be lost from view that\nthe Placita merely provides a status quaestionis:\nmaterial for instruction, discussion and reflection on, say, the shape\nof the moon, or the size of the sun, or the causes of earthquakes, or\nof the flooding of the Nile, or the various explanations of visual\nperception. Neither a suspension of judgement, in the manner of the\nSkeptics, nor a positive outcome, in the manner of Aristotle or the\nStoics, is ever formulated, no explicit advice ever given either way.\nOnly very rarely is there a critical note. \nFurthermore, there is a significant difference between\nAristotle’s overviews (which we know much better than those of\nTheophrastus, so for the sake of clarity one may restrict oneself to\nAristotle) and the corresponding passages and sections in Aëtius\nand his family. Aristotle’s purpose was to make a choice and to\nfind a solution, and many later authors also wanted this. But numerous\nchapters in the Placita literature when taken at face-value\nseem to make a decision impossible, because the bald diaeretic\ncontrast between the tenets listed in the lemmata results in a logjam,\nor diaphonia (‘discordance’), as the ancient\nSkeptics called it. It might be concluded from this stalemate that the\nonly remaining option is to suspend one’s judgment. It was at\nthe time impossible, for instance, to find out whether there is one\ncosmic system, or more. It is an attractive idea that at least part of\nthe material (in the course of time naturally updated by the inclusion\nof post-Aristotelian tenets) was adapted by Academic Skeptics to\ninduce the tranquillity of mind which follows upon suspension of\njudgment. \nConsequently, doxography in the narrower sense (derived from the\nnature of the majority of the sources discussed and edited by Diels in\nthe Doxographi Graeci), can be defined as: the normally very\nbrief presentation according to theme, or subject, of contrasting (or\neven bizarre, or compromise) tenets in natural philosophy (or science,\nif you wish), which in itself does not provide a decisive answer to\nthe issue involved although it may assist you to find a solution. The\napplication of the term ‘doxography’ to what one finds in\nAristotle (or, on a much more limited scale, in Plato, who\noccasionally quotes the views of others to further a discussion) can\ntherefore be misleading (see Mansfeld 2000). \nTurning now to doxography in the broad sense, we observe that\nCicero’s leisured and extensive presentations, e.g., in his\nOn the Nature of the Gods of the Epicurean and Stoic\ndoctrines in the field of theology-cum-physics—presentations\nfollowed by Academic-Skeptical refutations—may be, and have\nbeen, called by the name of doxography. But there are obvious\ndifferences from doxographies of the Aëtian type. To be sure, one\nmight perhaps, with some hesitation, maintain that what we have here\nis a sort of blow-up of the dialectical scheme one also finds in the\nPlacita literature, with the skeptical component made\nexplicit: contrasting doctrines which turn out to be improvable.\nSuch  a move however  is less valid for Diogenes\nLaërtius, in spite of the fact that this author several times\nmakes a distinction between the life (bios) of a person\n(Plato; the Stoic Zeno of Citium) and the areskonta or\ndogmata of this person, or of his school. It is therefore\nperhaps better to classify these overviews in Cicero and Diogenes\nLaërtius as belonging with an ancient genre which we may view as\na sub-species of doxography, namely the (largely lost) literature\nPeri Haireseôn (‘On Schools’), which deals\nwith philosophical, or medical, schools and eventually may include\narguments against the position of a particular hairesis\n(‘school’). Philodemus, and Arius Didymus (on ethics),\nbelong here as well. \nScholars, as we have noticed, also speak of ethical doxographies. One\ncould justify this usage by submitting that this is going beyond\nDiels, and back to Aristotle. We have seen that Aristotle advised his\npupils (and himself) also to construct lists of ethical propositions\nand problems. In his ethical treatises we actually find dialectical\noverviews concerning problems in ethics, though on a much more modest\nscale than in the physical treatises. But a doxographical literature\nin the field of ethics, which as to scale and taxonomy would be even\nremotely comparable to physical doxography, never existed. Yet one\noccasionally encounters short lists and overviews of ethical tenets in\nsome later authors. It is therefore possible that modest doxographical\ncollections of ethical views did circulate, and we may have some\nevidence concerned with the circulation (and adaptation) of a\ndiaeretical overview of tenets about the End, or Highest Good (Algra\n1997). \nA text of Aëtius in a single column has now been published (Mansfeld\nand Runia 2020), superseding Diels’ text in two columns. The\nevidence of the primary and secondary sources for the reconstruction\nof each individual chapter is cited in full, though for Plutarch and\nStobaeus only in the positive apparatus criticus. A detailed\ncommentary follows. For each chapter its reconstruction from the\nwitnesses is explained, its position in the context of the\nPlacita and sometimes of the wider tradition determined, its\ncontents and structure analyzed, such parallel evidence as is\navailable, both earlier and later to much later, analyzed, and\nproblems of interpretation raised by the text and contents of\nindividual tenets are often separately discussed. Each chapter ends\nwith a generous collection of further related texts to widen the\nhorizon and place the topic of the chapter in the context of the\nhistory of ancient philosophy from beginning to end. These\ncommentaries and collections of texts situate the Placita at\na key point in the development over the centuries of Greek philosophy,\nlooking backwards as well as forward. The existing remains amount to\nabout six-sevenths of the original (see Jeremiah 2018). \nFinally, it should be pointed out that doxographic works are tools of\na sort. They constitute a type of secondary literature of a fluid and\nunstable character, both as to form and as to contents. Shorter and\nlonger versions may be available alongside each other; in fact, for\nall the losses sustained by ancient literature, some still are.\nMaterials may be added, or lost, or added again in a continuous\nprocess of epitomizing and enlarging and updating—and it\nremained possible, of course, to inspect and excerpt original sources\nat least in some cases.  \nIn order the better to understand the value of the available evidence\npertaining to lost philosophical works from Antiquity one therefore\nshould attempt to understand the traditions and transmissions that are\ninvolved as a whole. One should take the rationale of the extant\noverviews into account, and try to discover the intentions of authors\nwho made use of doxographies. A naïve use of the available\ncollections of philosophical fragments, implying the putting on the\nsame level of reliability of most of the evidence that remains, does\nnot always produce good results.","contact.mail":"jaap.mansfeld@phil.uu.nl","contact.domain":"phil.uu.nl"}]
