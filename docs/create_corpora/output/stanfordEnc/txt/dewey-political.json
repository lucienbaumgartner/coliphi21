His immense philosophical and other written output\nencompasses most areas of philosophy as well as a host of other\neducational, social and political concerns. Although much of Dewey’s\npolitical writing is prompted by specific issues, his overall\norientation is deeply shaped by his pragmatism or (as he preferred)\n“experimentalism”. At the core of his political thinking are the\nbeliefs that science and democracy are mutually supportive and\ninterdependent enterprises, that they are egalitarian, progressive and\nrest on habits of open social communication, and that powerful\ninterpretations of liberal individualism and democracy have become\nossified and self-defeating. \n\n\n\nDewey’s earliest philosophical work was deeply influenced by the\nIdealism imbibed from his teacher and colleague George\nS. Morris. Through the 1890s, and particularly after a move to the\nnewly founded University of Chicago in 1894, Dewey began a steady\ndrift away from Idealist metaphysics, a process that he describes in\nan autobiographical essay “From Absolutism to\nExperimentalism”. Influenced notably by William James’s Principles\nof Psychology (1890), Dewey came to repudiate both the Idealist’s\nclaim that the study of empirical phenomena leads to the conclusion\nthat the world is mind, and the belief that the only alternative to\nthis is an atomistic empiricism. Yet he retained the Idealist ambition\nof articulating a unified account of human progress.  While at Chicago\nDewey’s interest in educational theory and conception of the school as\na central institution for a democratic society came to fruition, in\nthe foundation of the University Elementary School (the “Lab School”),\nand in books such as The School and Society (1899), The\nChild and the Curriculum (1902), and later in the culminating\nstatement Democracy and Education (1916). After a dispute\nwith the university president, Dewey left Chicago in 1904 for Columbia\nUniversity, where he remained until his retirement.\n\n\n\nThe period between the wars also saw an imposing series of books\narticulating and developing his philosophical beliefs. This includes\nReconstruction in Philosophy (1920), Human Nature and\nConduct (1922), Experience and Nature (1925), The\nQuest for Certainty (1929), Art as Experience (1934),\nA Common Faith (1934), Logic: The Theory of Inquiry\n(1938), and Theory of Valuation (1939).  The Public and\nIts Problems (1927) contained a defence of participatory\ndemocratic ideals against sceptics such as Walter Lippmann, who argued\nthat there was only space for a minimally democratic politics in\ncomplex modern societies. Dewey was a critic of laissez-faire\nliberalism and its accompanying individualistic view of society from\nhis early writings. This criticism was amplified during the\nDepression, where he expressed a form of liberal and democratic\nsocialism in writings such as Individualism, Old and New\n(1930), Liberalism and Social Action (1935), and Freedom\nand Culture (1939).\n\n\n\nAs a public intellectual, Dewey was a supporter of such causes as\nwomen’s suffrage and the Settlement House movement (he was a frequent\nvisitor to the philosopher Jane Addams’s and Ellen Gates Starr’s\nfamous Hull House in Chicago). He lectured to international audiences\nand his educational writing in particular was influential in a wide\nrange of settings, including notably China. His immense range of\npublic and political activities included presidency of the teachers’\nunion, sponsorship of the American Civil Liberties Union and NAACP,\nsupport for the Outlawry of War movement in the interwar years,\nchairing the People’s Lobby, and (persuaded by his student Sidney\nHook) participation in the “trial” of Leon Trotsky in Mexico in\n1938. After his move to New York, and particularly after the onset of\nthe First World War, a substantial part of his published output\nconsisted of commentary on current domestic and international\npolitics, and public statements on behalf of many causes, both\ndomestic and international. (He is probably the only philosopher in\nthis Encyclopaedia to have published both on the Treaty of Versailles\nand on the value of displaying art in post offices.) He was a\nprominent critic from the left of Roosevelt’s New Deal while at the\nsame time opposing Soviet communism and its western apologists. By the\ntime of his death he was lionized as a national sage (as with Bertrand\nRussell, this status was compatible with his promotion of\ncontroversial and often radical public positions). Both his\nphilosophical reputation and public status dimmed somewhat in\nsubsequent years. However, his work has remained an important\nreference point and resource for democratic theory.\n\n\n\nWe can see some of Dewey’s abiding concerns in political philosophy\nsketched in some of his early, overtly Idealist work.  In texts such\nas “The Ethics of Democracy” (EW1) and “Christianity and\nDemocracy” (EW4), Dewey elaborates a version of the Idealist\ncriticisms of classical liberal individualism. For this line of\ncriticism, classical liberalism envisages the individual as an\nindependent entity in competition with other individuals, and takes\nsocial and political life as a sphere in which this competitive\npursuit of self-interest is coordinated. By contrast, the Idealists\nrejected this view of social and political life as the aggregation of\ninherently conflicting private interests. Instead, they sought to view\nindividuals relationally: individuality could be sustained only where\nsocial life was understood as an organism in which the well-being of\neach part was tied to the well-being of the whole. Freedom in a\npositive sense consisted not merely in the absence of external\nconstraints but the positive fact of participation in such an\nethically desirable social order. On this foundation, Dewey rebuts\nHenry Maine’s bleak assessment in Popular Government that\ndemocracy is the rule of the ignorant majority. While it is important\nthat voters can reject their rulers and so control them to some\nextent, democracy is not simply a form of government defined by the\ndistribution of the franchise or majority rule. Rather what matters,\nas Dewey puts it, is the way that the majority is formed. To\nunderstand that requires grasping what Maine misses, in Dewey’s view:\nthat “men are not isolated non-social atoms, but are men only when in\nintrinsic relations” to one another, and the state in turn only\nrepresents them “so far as they have become organically related to one\nanother, or are possessed of unity of purpose and interest” (“The\nEthics of Democracy”, EW1, 231-2). Democracy is a form of\nmoral and spiritual association that recognizes the contribution that\neach member can make in his or her particular way to this ethical\ncommunity. And each of us can contribute to this community since we\neach only become the individuals we are through our engagement in the\ninstitutions and practices of our society. \n\nOther important themes also appear in these early\nstatements. Democracy is not “simply and solely a form of government”,\nbut a social and personal ideal; in other words, it is not only a\nproperty of political institutions but of a wide range of social\nrelationships. This ideal is common to a range of social spheres, and\nshould take [“industrial, as well as civil and political” forms (“The\nEthics of Democracy”, EW1, 246).  Through democracy in this\nexpansive and ideal sense, \nWhile the Christian conception of democracy recedes (but does not\nentirely disappear) in Dewey’s later work, the idea that\ndemocracy should be viewed as a form of relationship that encompasses\nand unifies different spheres of social life remains\nimportant. Dewey’s later work is more questioning of the traditional\nethical standards and ideals that he appeals to in an essay like “The\nEthics of Democracy”, and he is sharply critical of what he sees as\nthe residual Kantianism in Green’s idealism, although the\ngeneral orientation remains: individuals are not presocial atoms, and\ndemocracy is more than a method of majority rule through voting; it is\nalso a social and ethical ideal. \n\nAt the core of Dewey’s later work is his pragmatist or\n“experimentalist” notion of what he calls intelligence or inquiry as\nproblem-solving. This has reached its apogee in the successes of\nmodern science, medicine, and engineering, but in Dewey’s naturalistic\nand historical view is continuous with, and arises from, mundane\nprocesses of inquiry and problem-solving or, as he put it in a text\nfor educationalists, with How We Think (MW6,\nLW8). The goal of an inquiry is not to arrive at a certain\npicture of the nature of things, but to come up with an inevitably\nprovisional solution to the practical and intellectual problem that\nsparked it – to resolve problematic situations. Inquiry should be\nunderstood as part of our struggle with an objectively precarious but\nimprovable environment. Inquiry is demanded by what he calls an\n“incomplete” or “problematic” situation, that is, one in which our\ninherited habits and standard ways of doing things run into trouble,\nperhaps through our actions’ having unexpected consequences, through\nnew needs and desires, or through conflict with others. These\nchallenges prompt us to step back, identify the problem we are\nconfronted with, and reflect on what to do next. Modern societies have\nan awesome exemplar of successful inquiry, in the natural sciences\nwhich, Dewey argues, have been progressive and cumulative, giving us\ngreater and greater understanding and control of the natural\nworld. This has above all been the result of their\nexperimental character, in which no intellectual element is\ntaken to be beyond rational scrutiny. Theories and hypotheses are\ninvented, used, tested, revised, and so on. At the same time, new\nmethods for the invention, use, testing and revision of theories and\nhypotheses are developed and refined, and so are new standards for\nevaluating theories and hypotheses. What counts as success in inquiry\nis some practice’s meeting these standards, but these standards\nthemselves may be judged in the light of how they square with ongoing\npractices of inquiry. In this way, the methods used by science are not\nfixed but themselves have a history and develop progressively and\nsometimes in unexpected ways. A crucial dimension of the experience\nthat has established these standards and practices is social or\ncommunal, as we must look to the community of our fellow inquirers for\ntesting and confirmation of our findings. \nDewey’s conception of inquiry is intended as a general model of\nreflective intelligence: we struggle with problems in all sorts of\nareas of human experience, including art and ethics. Accordingly he\nrejects non-cognitivism about values and holds that values can be true\nor false in his pragmatic sense, responsive to reasons and corrigible\nin the light of experience. He argues that we should generally think\nof values as reflective responses to problematic situations, with the\naim of providing means for what Dewey calls their “directed\nresolution” (most fully in these terms in the late work,  Theory of\nValuation  (LW13)). As his treatment of art within this\nframework suggests, Dewey’s view of problem-solving is far from being\nonly narrowly “practical”. Practical inquiry encompasses instrumental\nreasoning about means: so if we our path to the beach is blocked by a\ngiant rock (the problematic situation) we can reflect on what it would\ninvolve to take another route, to climb the rock, to dynamite it,\netc., (and can imaginatively rehearse the options). But it also\nincludes reflective criticism of ends: if the journey now has to\ninclude arduous rock-climbing, we may reconsider how important our end\nof getting to the beach is. Inquiry as practical judgment involves\nreflecting on, and revising our ends, in the light of what is involved\nfor us in achieving them, and this often leads us creatively to\ntransform our values and to develop new ends.\n \nIn keeping with this pragmatic naturalism, Dewey’s ethical writings\napproach moral theory in a distinctive way. Moral theories are\ngenerated in contingent historical circumstances, are responsive to\nthe particular needs and conflicts of those circumstances, and reflect\ntheir prejudices and assumption. Ideas that were functional for a\nparticular social order can cease to make sense or become\ndysfunctional as that order changes. Mistaking contingent social\nproducts for unchangeable features of human nature or psychology is\none of the core occupational hazards of moral philosophers. Famously,\nfor example, he thinks that the philosophical preference for\n“intrinsic” goods of contemplation and related values such as\naesthetic purity originally reflect a form of Greek society structured\naround a slave class and a leisured class but is reproduced (with\nincreasing difficulty) in other class-divided societies. \nDewey isn’t a sceptic about inherited moral theory. Rather, he\nsees it as as a repertoire of conceptual resources and tools that we\nhave for dealing with the problems of value judgement in a world of\nplural and changing values. In Ethics, Dewey and James\nH. Tufts offer an interpretation of different canonical value\ntheories, teleology, deontology and virtue ethics as providing\ncontrasting methodological orientations for identifying, describing\nand solving problems. Instead of asking which of these approaches best\ncaptures “our intuitions” and so should be used as an unvarying\nstandard to guide decision-making in concrete situations, Dewey argues\nthat no one approach constitutes a theoretically adequate guide to how\nto act in particular situations. Instead, these provide standpoints\nfrom which agents can identify and analyze problems, sift important\nfrom unimportant considerations, and appraise our raw preferences and\nalternative plans of action. Conflict among these approaches cannot be\nresolved in theory, only in practice, if at all, where an agent must\nmake “the best adjustment he can among forces which are genuinely\ndisparate” (“Three Independent Factors in Morals”, MW5,\n288). This rejection of fixed moral standard should also not be\nconfused with ethical “neutrality” on Dewey’s part, as\nwe’ll see when we turn to his political theory.   \n\nValues, Dewey suggests, can be viewed as constructs to solve\npractical problems. Like an outmoded piece of technology, a past value\nwhich was once constructed to address a problem in one set of\ncircumstances can outlive its usefulness, and become a hindrance to\nthe capacity of those in the present to deal with their practical\nneeds and worries. This, Dewey believes, is the case with values of\nclassical liberalism. These have come to block the capacity to resolve\nsocial problems in a way compatible with what he takes to be\nliberalism’s core commitment to individual liberty. It is in this way\nthat “the slogans of liberalism in one period can become the\nbulwarks of reaction” in the next (“Logical Method and\nLaw”, MW15, 76). He develops this thought in discussing\nthe relation of individual and society, the character and value of\nfreedom, and the scope of legitimate social and political action. \n\nDewey criticises classical liberalism for conceiving of the individual\nas “something given, something already there”, prior to\nsociety and for viewing social institutions merely as instruments for\ncoordinating the interests of pre-social individuals. Instead, he\nargues, social institutions are “means for creating\nindividuals” (Reconstruction in Philosophy, MW12,\n190-192). In this way, classical liberalism exemplifies what Dewey\ndescribes as “the most pervasive fallacy of philosophical thinking”\n(“Context and Thought”, LW5, 5). This is the tendency to\ndivide up experienced phenomena, and to take the distinct analysed\nelements to be separate existences, independent both of the analysis\nand of each other. That this abstraction is in particular\ncircumstances essential for inquiry is an important theme in\nDewey’s philosophy. But this abstraction goes wrong “whenever\nthe distinctions or elements that are discriminated are treated as if\nthey were final and self-sufficient” (“Context and Thought”,\nLW5, 7), as when classical liberalism treats the individual\nas “something given”. Instead, he argues, a genuine: \n\nThe abstraction of the individual from social context in classical\nliberalism shapes its ethics. If the individual is thought of as\nexisting prior to social institutions, then it is easier to envisage\nsecuring freedom for the individual in purely negative terms as solely\nconsisting in the removal of external impediments on individual\naction, such as legal restrictions on freedom of speech. By contrast,\nDewey argues that, while removal of external constraints may often be\nimportant for supplying the conditions of liberty, liberty in the\nsense in which it is a value for liberals does not consist in the mere\nabsence of external constraint. For classical liberalism or “old\nindividualism”, the individual is viewed as surrounded by a protective\ncordon of rights, which define his or her freedom. Freedom is taken to\nconsist in the absence of some intentional constraint on the\nindividual’s ability to pursue his or her chosen goals. For Dewey,\nthis negative view of freedom is at the root of the wider social,\nethical and political defects of this form of individualism (“Religion\nand Morality in a Free Society”, LW15, 181). What is valuable\nabout freedom is not the negative absence of interference but the\npositive “power to be an individualized self” (The Public and Its\nProblems, LW2, 329). \n\n\n\nThree features of Dewey’s view of individuality in this sense are most\nprominent: individuality is reflective, it is social, and it must be\nexercised in order to be enjoyed. The first point is that freedom is\nheld to consist in the capacity and willingness on the part of a\nperson to reflect on her or his own goals, aims and projects, and to\nrevise them as a result of this reflection. Individuality in what we\nmay call a weak sense is universally possessed and consists in the\ndistinctive patterns of response to the environment that each person\ndisplays, “a distinctive way of feeling the impacts of the world and\nof showing a preferential bias in response to these impacts”\n(Individualism Old and New, LW5, 121). In the\nstronger sense in which it is a value for liberals, according to\nDewey, individuality consists in the personal capacity for\nchoice, “the most characteristic activity of a self”\n(Ethics, 2nd edition, LW7, 285). This is\nnot a matter of arbitrarily or whimsically plumping for one option\nrather than another, for Dewey.  Rather, choice that is expressive of\nindividuality in the strong sense involves intelligent criticism of\noptions. Accordingly, we can understand why Dewey claims that “to\nforesee future objective alternatives and to be able by deliberation\nto choose one of them and thereby weigh its chances in the struggle\nfor future existence, measures our freedom” (Human Nature and\nConduct, MW14, 210). Second, freedom as individuality is\nsocial: it is thought to involve participation in shaping the social\nconditions that bear on individuality. As Dewey puts it in The\nPublic and Its Problems, liberty “is that secure release and\nfulfilment of personal potentialities which take place only in rich\nand manifold association with others: the power to be an\nindividualized self making a distinctive contribution and enjoying in\nits own way the fruits of association” (The Public and Its\nProblems, LW2, 329).  Freedom in its fullest sense,\nthen, is only possible in a canonical form of social order, in which\nall take part in shaping the conditions of common life. Third, this is\nwhat has been called an exercise rather than an\nopportunity concept of freedom. For some positive theories of\nliberty, including Dewey’s, it is a necessary condition of an agent’s\nbeing free that he or she should actually pursue those ends outlined\nby that theory as constitutive of the good – that is, he or she\nshould exercise the opportunity: I am in possession of my liberty in\nthis valuable sense for Dewey only if I actually act in these\nways. \n\nThis account of the character and value of freedom was for Dewey, as\nfor the Idealists and New Liberals that he drew on and for later\nwriters on negative and positive liberty such as Isaiah Berlin, flowed\ninto a debate about the proper scope of social and political\naction. The classical identification of liberty with negative liberty\nbolsters the identification of freedom with the sphere of life outside\nthe scope of political action. By contrast, for Dewey the scope of\nlegitimate social and political action had to be determined\nexperimentally: laissez-faire should not be assumed to be the\ndefault position for a liberal, according to Dewey, since what he\ncalled intelligent social control or social action (rather, it should\nbe noted, than state control) is often a requirement of positive\nliberty or individuality, in modern industrial\nconditions. Unsurprisingly, this drew a hostile reception from\nadvocates of a negative concept of liberty such as F. A. Hayek. The\nidentification of freedom with individuality in Dewey’s sense allows\nthe necessary means for achieving individuality to be understood as\nnecessary conditions of freedom. So, for example, throughout his life\nhe argued that education to produce undocile, unservile citizens was\nessential, in the name of individuality. More pointedly, Dewey argued,\nparticularly in the 1930s, that a socialized economy was necessary for\nindividuality. Dewey drew on a wide range of sources to flesh out his\nconception of social action or social control, including the utopian\nEdward Bellamy and British guild socialist G. D.  H. Cole. While much\nof his writing is unstructured and occasional – and spread\nacross many different contexts over a long period – rather than\nsystematic or prescriptive in a very specific way, Dewey supported\nsocial reforms that tended to strengthen workers’ rights, including\nrights to form and join unions, and to take strike action, and the\nextension of democratic control in the workplace, in the name of\nfreedom as individuality.   \n\nSince both positive liberty and the idea of social control have been\nthought to have worrying authoritarian implications, and Dewey is\nsometimes thought of as a technocrat, it is worth emphasising the\nliberal and democratic character of Dewey’s conception of social\naction. Individuality as an ethical ideal requires that individuals\nfind their own way, and not have particular doctrines or social roles\nimposed on them.  Dewey doesn’t think that the liberal rights\nprotected in the name of individual liberty (such as freedoms of\nspeech, thought, movement, and so on) should be dispensed\nwith. Furthermore, viewing liberty through the prism of individuality\nonly opens up the possibility of political action in the name of\nliberty, but it does not itself require it. Finally, and in contrast\nto technocratic critics of laissez-faire such as Walter\nLippmann, Dewey argues that an extensive form of democracy is\nessential for social action, and he vests little faith in experts. \nWhile democracy is the key organising concept of Dewey’s political\nphilosophy, it is one that he thinks of in a very unusual way. As he\nputs it in Democracy and Education, it is “more than a form\nof government; it is primarily a mode of associated living, of\nconjoint communicated experience” (Democracy and Education,\nMW 9 p. 93). What does Dewey mean by this kind of claim? \n\nOne place to start is with Dewey’s most developed and distinctive work\nin political theory, The Public and Its Problems, which is in\npart a response to Walter Lippmann’s influential sceptical attack on\ndemocratic theory in books such as Public Opinion (1922) and\nThe Phantom Public (1925). Lippmann (who like Dewey was\ninfluenced by William James and who shared many philosophical and\npolitical commitments with Dewey at an earlier stage of his career)\nagrees that contemporary moral and political thinking has not caught\nup with the modern world. Unlike Dewey, however, Lippmann thinks that\nunderstanding the complexity and opacity of modernity requires us to\nset aside the democratic illusion that citizens are “omnicompetent”,\nand instead embrace the legitimacy of decision-making by qualified\nexperts. The force of this critique of democracy for Dewey in part\nderives from its deployment of his own intellectual strategy for ends\nwith which he vehemently disagrees. Dewey’s response to this is to\npoint out that experts have their own biases, and need correction from\nthose who have to live with the consequences of their\ndecisions. Although Dewey can sometimes appear to sound dismissive\nabout what he calls the “political machinery” of democracy such as the\nvote and majority rule, he never regards this as inessential or\ndisposable. At the minimum, for Dewey, this machinery helps to protect\nindividuals from putative experts about where the interests of people\nlie. A class of experts will inevitably slide into a class whose\ninterests diverge from those of the rest and becomes a committee of\noligarchs. So “the strongest point to be made in behalf of even such\nrudimentary political forms as democracy has attained, popular voting,\nmajority rule and so on, is that to some extent they involve a\nconsultation and discussion which concerns social needs and troubles”\n(The Public and Its Problems, LW2, p. 364). Taken in\nisolation, this way of viewing the desirability of democratic\npolitical machinery seems instrumental and minimal; instrumental, in\nthat the desirability of democracy derives from its protecting the\ninterests of each individual against the depredations of an elite\nclass, and minimal, in that the rationale for popular participation is\nlimited to the need to keep the elite informed about where the shoe\npinches, if its policies are not to be misguided. While Dewey\nsometimes refers rather scathingly to the “machinery” conception of\ndemocracy, he is committed to improving this machinery (by supporting\nthe equal distribution of the franchise, for example) rather than\nmerely dismissing it as unimportant. The real target of his ire is the\nexclusive identification of democracy with a particular current set of\npolitical institutions, particularly only with elections and majority\nrule. As in the case of the defunct idea of liberalism, Dewey thinks\nof this as a once liberating conception that now contains an inbuilt\nconservative bias that prevents more imaginative institutional\nthinking. \nDemocracy is more than merely a means to check on political leaders\nand administrators or call them to account. Dewey thinks that this\nmisses out the importance of democracy for a much wider range of\nsocial institutions than this narrow view captures, including the\nworkplace. It is “superficial” to think that “government is located in\nWashington and Albany. There is government in the family, in business,\nin the church, in every social group” which regulates the behaviour of\nits members (“Democracy and Educational Administration”,\nLW11, 221). The scope of democracy, in the sense of the range\nof institutions to which it applies, should not be construed\nnarrowly. If our individuality is shaped by the wide range of\ninstitutions that make up our social habitat, as Dewey thinks, then\nthe rules and norms governing these institutions are too important to\nus to be left to chance, dogma, tradition or inherited hierarchy. So\nrestricting democratic scrutiny and control to a single sphere of\nsocial life would be a mistake.    \nFurther, as Dewey says, “[d]emocracy is only estimable through the\nchanged conception of intelligence that forms modern science”\n(“Intelligence and Morals”, MW4, 39); that is, through his\nconception of inquiry. Democracy is a method for identifying and\nsolving the common problems confronted by communities. democracy is\nunderstood as consisting in and as providing the conditions for\nexperimental inquiry. Robust inquiry requires that we must have access\nto all the available evidence and arguments. If we want our inquiry to\nbe successful, we should not prejudge its outcomes, by excluding\nsources of experience that allow us to explore and correct our\nhypotheses. By contrast, \nAlthough the “democratic faith” suggests that we are all capable of\nmeaningfully contributing to critical inquiry, the development of\nhabits of intelligent conduct isn’t taken for granted: they can\nbe degraded by social disempowerment, propaganda and ideology.  And,\nas we’ve seen, they are in any case viewed as hard-won\nachievements of schooling and a generally supportive society.  \nDemocratic societies are thought of as both seeking to attain\ndesirable goals, and arguing over how to do so, and also as arguing\nover what a desirable goal is. In other words, democratic politics is\nnot simply a channel through which we can assert our interests (as it\nis for the first argument), but a forum or mode of activity in which\nwe can arrive at a conception of what our interests are. Accordingly,\nlike recent deliberative democrats, Dewey ascribes a central\nimportance to discussion, consultation, persuasion and debate in\ndemocratic decision-making. As the experimentalist conception of\ninquiry insists, this does not imply that we need a priori\ncriteria in order to establish if this process has been\nsuccessful. Rather, criteria for what counts as a satisfactory\nsolution may be hammered out in the process of searching for\none. Democracy is experimental for Dewey in that it allows, or should\nallow, a profound questioning of the idées fixes of\nthe established order, even if, of course, much democratic politics\nwill not take the form of such questioning.    \nDewey views democracy as an ideal of associated life in the sense that\nas an ideal it reconciles individual and collective\ninterests. As he describes this ideal, \nWe can understand Dewey this way. In working out what to do,\nindividuals and groups are confronted by dilemmas about what to\ndo. Some of us (such as a gang of thieves, in Dewey’s example)\naddress these problems in ways that promote certain kinds of growth\nand development (you can flourish as a thief) but ultimately frustrate\ntheir members and their own goals, since these activities inherently\ngenerate conflict with other individuals and groups. It is only a\ndemocratic community, Dewey believes, which allows each member fully\nto realize her potentialities without conflict and coercion. For the\nindividual, democracy means having a share in directing the activities\nof the group, while for the group it demands liberation of the\npotentialities of the individual members in harmony with their common\ninterests. Yet even at his most optimistic, Dewey doesn’t\nimagine away differences of opinion, conflicts of interest and value\npluralism as ineliminable features of social and political life. Even\nwhen his epistemological standards are adhered to, “[d]ifferences of\nopinion in the sense of differences of judgment as to the course which\nit is best to follow, the policy which it is best to try out, will\nstill exist” (The Public and Its Problems, LW2,\n362).  Democracy as public discussion is viewed as the best way of\ndealing with the conflict of interests in a society:  \nOn Dewey’s death, obituarists eulogized him as the authoritative\nAmerican philosopher of democracy. Both during his life and\nsubsequently, he has been a more controversial figure than this\nreputation would suggest. In part, this reflects his profile and\nfecundity. Precisely because he ranged so prominently across such a\nwide intellectual terrain, Dewey has been a point of reference and\ntarget for commentators in all the fields he explored: his educational\nwritings in particular became a default fons et origo of the\nalleged ills ascribed to schemes of progressive education by their\ncritics. Further, across a long and active career as a public\nintellectual, Dewey adopted bold and controversial political positions\non deeply divisive issues, including (for example) robustly supporting\nUS entry into the First World War and later opposing intervention in\nthe Second World War, which also attracted fierce opprobrium as well\nas support. \nDewey’s pragmatism was always highly contentious and by the\nmid-twentieth century to some extent staled in the face of stimulating\nnew research programmes, such as logical empiricism, the Frankfurt\nSchool, existentialism, and other approaches. To skeptics in\ndemocratic theory, following in the tracks of Lippmann and other of\nDewey’s contemporaries such as Reinhold Niebuhr, Dewey’s radical and\nunconventional idea of democracy is extravagantly optimistic about the\nepistemic capacities of the individual citizen and of democratic\ninstitutions.  \nThe philosopher who probably did the most singlehandedly to promote\nthe recrudescence of interest in Dewey’s thinking after this period of\nrelative marginality, Richard Rorty, found in his work an\nhistorically-minded questioning of epistemological foundations and\naspirations to a God’s-eye point of view that of course provided\nfodder for Rorty’s own project. Yet, in relation to political\nphilosophy, Rorty’s skeptical postmodern liberal ironism glossed over\nthe detailed architecture of Dewey’s ethical and political theory, and\nmade very little both of Dewey’s own naturalistic confidence in the\nmutually supportive and progressive character of scientific method and\ndemocracy. Even among those philosophers who have been keen to draw on\nthe pragmatist tradition as a resource for more positively elaborating\na political theory than Rorty was inclined to there are important\nfigures, such as Cheryl Misak, who seek foundations for their view\nelsewhere, notably in Peirce’s view of the precondition of belief, and\nexpress doubts about what they see as Dewey’s less clearly grounded\nethical commitments. However, others such as Hilary and Ruth Anna\nPutnam and Philip Kitcher more wholeheartedly identify with, and try\nto develop, the commitments of Dewey’s pragmatic naturalism, in\nthinking through the relationship between scientific inquiry, ethics\nand democracy. In part, recent increased engagement with Dewey’s\npolitical philosophy from philosophers across a range of traditions,\nincluding epistemic democrats, such as Elizabeth Anderson, and\nFrankfurt School critical theorists, such as Axel Honneth, flows from\nan interest in developing a fuller understanding of democracy as a\nmethod of social learning. Dewey’s political philosophy remains an\nimportant reference point and source of inspiration for thinkers who\nseek to explore radical forms of democratic liberalism.
