It amounts to the claim\nthat social phenomena must be explained by showing how they result\nfrom individual actions, which in turn must be explained through\nreference to the intentional states that motivate the individual\nactors. It involves, in other words, a commitment to the primacy of\nwhat Talcott Parsons would later call “the action frame of\nreference” (Parsons 1937: 43–51) in social-scientific\nexplanation. It is also sometimes described as the claim that\nexplanations of “macro” social phenomena must be supplied\nwith “micro” foundations, ones that specify an\naction-theoretic mechanism (Alexander, 1987).\n\n\n\nA contrast is often drawn, following J.W.N. Watkins (1952a), between\nmethodological individualism and methodological holism. This is\nusually tendentious, since there are very few social scientists who\ndescribe themselves as methodological holists. There are, however,\nforms of social-scientific explanation with more active adherents that\nmethodological individualism precludes or downgrades. These include,\nmost importantly, functionalism, many types of sociobiology,\n“memetics” or evolutionary cultural explanation,\npsychoanalytic and “depth hermeneutic” methods, and any\nform of explanatory generalization grounded in purely statistical\nanalysis.\n\n\n\nDefenders of methodological individualism generally claim that it is\nan innocent doctrine, devoid of any political or ideological\ncontent. Weber himself cautioned that “it is a tremendous\nmisunderstanding to think that an ‘individualistic’\nmethod should involve what is in any conceivable sense an\nindividualistic system of values” (Weber 1922:\n18). Nevertheless, the doctrine of methodological individualism became\nembroiled in a number of highly politicized debates during the\n20th century, largely because it was often invoked as a way\nof discrediting historical materialism.  There were two distinct\nrounds of controversy on this score. The first occurred primarily\nduring the 1950s, in response to the work of Friedrich von Hayek and\nKarl Popper. The second round occurred during the 1980s, in\nresponse to Jon Elster, this time as part of critical debates within\nthe movement known as “analytical Marxism.” During the\nlatter period, methodological individualism became widely associated\nwith what many called “rational choice imperialism.”\n\n\n\nThe phrase methodische Individualismus was actually coined by\nWeber’s student, Joseph Schumpeter, in his 1908 work Das Wesen und\nder Hauptinhalt der theoretischen Nationalökonomie. The\nfirst use of the term “methodological individualism” in\nEnglish was again by Schumpeter in his 1909 Quarterly Journal of\nEconomics paper, “On the Concept of Social Value”\n(see Udehn 2001, 214). However, the theoretical elaboration of the\ndoctrine is due to Weber, and Schumpeter uses the term as a way of\nreferring to the Weberian view. \n\nIn Economy and Society, Weber articulates the central precept\nof methodological individualism in the following way: When discussing\nsocial phenomena, we often talk about various “social\ncollectivities, such as states, associations, business corporations,\nfoundations, as if they were individual persons”(Weber 1922,\n13).  Thus we talk about them having plans, performing actions,\nsuffering losses, and so forth. The doctrine of methodological\nindividualism does not take issue with these ordinary ways of\nspeaking, it merely stipulates that “in sociological work these\ncollectivities must be treated as solely the resultants and modes of\norganization of the particular acts of individual persons, since these\nalone can be treated as agents in a course of subjectively\nunderstandable action” (Weber 1922, 13). \n\nFor Weber, the commitment to methodological individualism is very\nclosely related to the commitment to verstehende (or\ninterpretive) patterns of explanation in sociology. The reason for\nprivileging individual action in sociological explanation is that only\naction is “subjectively understandable.” Weber reserves\nthe term “action” to refer to the subset of human behavior\nthat is motivated by linguistically formulated or\n“meaningful” mental states. (Generally speaking: coughing\nis behavior, apologizing afterwards is action.) Updating the\nterminology somewhat, we can say that the defining characteristic of\nan action is that it is motivated by a mental state with propositional\ncontent, i.e., an intentional state. The importance of action for\nWeber is that we have interpretive access to it, by virtue of our\ncapacity to understand the agent’s underlying motive. This permits the\nsocial scientist to “accomplish something which is never\nattainable in the natural sciences, namely the subjective\nunderstanding of the action of the component individuals” (Weber\n1922, 15). Action-theoretic explanation is central to\nsocial-scientific analysis, therefore, because without knowing\nwhy people do what they do, we do not really understand why\nany of the more large-scale phenomena with which they are embroiled\noccur. \n\nThus methodological individualism is a slightly misleading term, since\nthe goal is not to privilege the individual over the collective in\nsocial-scientific explanation, but rather to privilege the\naction-theoretic level of explanation. This privileging of the\naction-theoretic level is methodological because it is imposed by the\nstructure of interpretive social science, where the goal is to provide\nan understanding of social phenomena. Actions can be\nunderstood in a way that other social phenomena cannot, precisely\nbecause they are motivated by intentional states. Yet only individuals\npossess intentional states, and so the methodological privileging of\nactions entails the methodological privileging of individuals. Thus\nthe “individualism” in methodological individualism is\nmore a byproduct of its central theoretical commitment than a\nmotivating factor. This is what defenders to the doctrine have tried\nto communicate, with greater or lesser degrees of success, by claiming\nthat it is politically or ideologically neutral. \n\nIt is worth emphasizing the difference between methodological\nindividualism, in Weber’s sense, and the older traditions of atomism\n(or unqualified individualism) in the social sciences. Many writers\nclaim to find the origins of methodological individualism amongst\neconomists of the Austrian School (especially Carl Menger), and\ndoctrines articulated during the Methodenstreit of the 1880s\n(Udehn 2001). Others trace it back to Thomas Hobbes, and the\n“resolutive-compositive” method elaborated in the opening\nsections of the Leviathan (Lukes 1968, 119). Yet the\ndistinctive character of this type of atomism was summed up quite\nclearly by Hobbes, with his injunction to “consider men as if\nbut even now sprung out of the earth, and suddainly (like Mushromes)\ncome to full maturity without all kind of engagement to each\nother” (1651, 8:1). The atomistic view is based upon the\nsuggestion that it is possible to develop a complete characterization\nof individual psychology that is fully pre-social, then deduce what\nwill happen when a group of individuals, so characterized, enter into\ninteraction with one another. Methodological individualism, on the\nother hand, does not involve a commitment to any particular claim\nabout the content of the intentional states that motivate\nindividuals, and thus remains open to the possibility that human\npsychology may have an irreducibly social dimension. Thus one way of\naccentuating the difference between atomism and methodological\nindividualism is to note that the former entails a complete reduction\nof sociology to psychology, whereas the latter does not. \n\nFinally, it should be noted that Weber’s commitment to methodological\nindividualism is closely related to his more well-known methodological\ndoctrine, viz., the theory of ideal types. Historical explanation may\nmake reference to the actual content of the intentional states that\nmotivated particular historical actors, but the sociologist is\ninterested in producing much more abstract explanatory\ngeneralizations, and so cannot appeal to the specific motives of\nparticular individuals. Thus sociological theory must be based upon a\nmodel of human action. And because of the constraints that\ninterpretation imposes, this model must be a model of\nrational human action (Weber writes: “it is convenient\nto treat all irrational, affectually determined elements of behavior\nas factors of deviation from a conceptually pure type of rational\naction” [1922, 6].) \n\nThus one of the most important consequences of Weber’s methodological\nindividualism is that it puts rational action theory at the core of\nsocial-scientific inquiry. This is why subsequent generations of\nsocial theorists, under Weber’s influence, sought to bring about the\nmethodological unification of the social sciences by producing what\ncame to be known as a “general theory of action” –\none that would broaden the economic model of action in such a way as\nto incorporate the central action-theoretic insights of (primarily)\nsociologists, anthropologists, and psychologists. The work of Talcott\nParsons in the first half of the century was the most important in\nthis regard, with the unification movement reaching its apogee in the\ncollaborative publication in 1951 of Toward a General Theory of\nAction, co-edited by Parsons and Edward Shils. Yet shortly\nthereafter, partly due to problems with the unification program,\nParsons abandoned his commitment to both methodological individualism\nand action theory, adopting a purely systems-theoretic view. This led\nto an overall lapse in the project of producing a general theory of\naction, until it was revitalized in 1981 by the publication of\nJürgen Habermas’s The Theory of Communicative\nAction. \n\nIt has never escaped anyone’s attention that the discipline that most\nclearly satisfies the strictures of methodological individualism is\nmicroeconomics (in the tradition of neoclassical marginalism), and\nthat homo economicus is the most clearly articulated model of\nrational action. Of course, this tradition has not always been in the\nascendancy within the economics profession. In particular, there are\nmany who have felt that macroeconomics could be a completely\nself-standing domain of inquiry (reflected in the fact that the\nundergraduate economics curriculum is still often divided into\n“micro” and “macro.”) There have always been\nthose who would like to plot the movements of the business cycle, or\nof the stock market, in a way that disregards entirely the motives\nthat individual actors may have for doing what they do. Similarly,\nmany have tried to discover correlations between macroeconomic\nvariables, such as unemployment and inflation rates, without feeling\nthe need to speculate as to why a change in one rate might lead to\nmovement in the other.  Thus there has always been a very lively\ndebate within the economics profession about the value of the\n“rational actor” model that is at the heart of general\nequilibrium theory. \n\nOne of the earliest iterations of this debate occurred during the\nso-called Methodenstreit between members of the Austrian\nSchool in Economics and the German Historical School. However, members\nof the “first generation” of the Austrian School, such\nas Carl Menger, were atomists (Menger defended his individualistic method\nin terms of conceptual gains achieved by “reducing complicated\nphenomena to their elements” [Menger 1883, 93]). It was\nonly members of the second generation, first and foremost Friedrich\nvon Hayek, who would explicitly identify themselves with the Weberian\ndoctrine of methodological individualism and defend it through\nreference to the demands of interpretive social science. The key text\nis Hayek’s paper, “Scientism and the Study of Society,”\nserialized in Economica (1942–44), and later published as the\nfirst part of The Counter-Revolution of Science (1955). \n\nIn Hayek’s view, the desire on the part of social scientists to\nemulate the physical sciences creates an exaggerated fear of\nteleological or “purposive” concepts. This leads many\neconomists to eschew any reference to intentional states and to focus\npurely upon statistical correlations between economic variables. The\nproblem with this focus is that it leaves the economic phenomena\nunintelligible. Take, for example, the movement of prices. One might\nnotice a constant correlation between the date of the first frost and\nfluctuations in the price of wheat. But we do not really\nunderstand the phenomenon until it has been explained in\nterms of the rational actions of economic agents: an early frost\nreduces yields, leading to less intense price competition among\nsuppliers, more among consumers, etc. Thus Hayek insists that, in\neffect, all macroeconomic analysis is incomplete in the absence of\n“micro” foundations. \n\nIt is important to note, however, that while Hayek has a model of\nrational action as the centerpiece of his view, his is most\nemphatically not a form of rationalism. On the contrary, he puts\nparticular emphasis upon the way that various economic phenomena can\nemerge as the unintended consequences of rational action. Even though\nthe outcomes that people achieve may bear no resemblance to the ones\nthat they intended, it is still important to know what they\nthought they were doing when they chose to pursue to course\nof action that they chose – not least because it is important to\nknow why they persist in pursuing that course of action, despite the\nfact that it is not producing the intended consequences. \n\nOf course, part of Hayek’s motivation for endorsing methodological\nindividualism and demanding that social-scientific explanations\nspecify a mechanism at the action-theoretic level is that he wants to\nemphasize the limitations of the individual’s actor’s\nperspective. It’s fine to talk about macroeconomic variables like\n“the inflation rate,” but it is important to remember that\nindividual actors (generally speaking) do not respond directly to such\nindicators. All that they can see are changes in the immediate prices\nthat they must pay for production inputs or consumption goods, and\nthis is what they respond to. The large-scale consequences of the\nchoices they make in response to these changes are largely unintended,\nand so any regularity in these consequences constitutes a spontaneous\norder. This is a crucial element of Hayek’s information-based argument\nfor capitalism: economic actors do not have access to the same\ninformation as economic theorists, thus it is only when we see the\noperations of the economy through their eyes that we can begin to see\nthe advantages of a decentralized system of coordination like the\nmarket. \n\nTo illustrate the importance of the individual’s perspective, Hayek\ngives the example of the process that leads to the development of a\npath in the woods. One person works his way through, choosing the\nroute that offers the least local resistance. His passage reduces,\never so slightly, the resistance offered along that route to the next\nperson who walks though, who is therefore, in making the same set of\ndecisions, likely to follow the same route. This increases the chances\nthat the next person will do so, and so on. Thus the net of effect of\nall these people passing through is that they “make a\npath,” even though no one has the intention of doing so, and no\none even plans out its trajectory. It is a product of spontaneous\norder: “Human movements through the district come to conform to\na definite pattern which, although the result of deliberate decisions\nof many people, has yet not been consciously designed by anyone”\n(Hayek 1942, 289). \n\nThe problem with ignoring the agent’s perspective, in Hayek’s view, is\nthat it can easily lead us to overestimate our powers of rational\nplanning and control, and thus to fall into “rationalism.”\nBy contrast, the central virtue of methodological individualism is\nthat it helps us to see the limitations of our own reason (Hayek 1944,\n33). Formulating theories that refer directly to the “interest\nrate,” or “inflationary pressures,” or “the\nunemployment rate” can mislead us into thinking that we can\nmanipulate these variables, and thus intervene successfully in the\neconomy. We forget that these concepts are abstractions, used not to\nguide individual action, but rather to describe the net effect of\nmillions of individual decisions. The key characteristic of\nmethodological individualism is that it “systematically starts\nfrom the concepts which guide individuals in their actions and not\nfrom the results of their theorizing about their actions” (1942,\n286). It therefore encourages, in Hayek’s view, greater modesty with\nrespect to social planning. \n\nHayek does not mention methodological individualism after the\n1950s. Indeed, the role that evolutionary explanations come to play in\nhis later work implies a tacit retraction of his commitment to the\ndoctrine. \n\nFor many years, the term methodological individualism was associated\nprimarily with the work of Karl Popper. This is due to the extensive\ndebate triggered by Popper’s papers, “The Poverty of\nHistoricism” (1944/45), and later his book, The Open Society\nand Its Enemies (1945). Popper, however, although making use of\nthe term, did little to defend his commitment to it. Instead he left\nthis job to his former student, J.W.N. Watkins. It was this debate\nbetween Watkins and his critics that (perhaps unfairly) solidified the\nassociation in many people’s minds between Popper and methodological\nindividualism. (It was also this debate that brought the doctrine to\nthe widespread attention of philosophers.) \n\nUnfortunately, the version of methodological individualism that Popper\nbequeathed to his student Watkins was considerably more difficult to\ndefend than the one he inherited from Hayek. Since the beginning, the\nprecepts of methodological individualism were thought to have been\nimposed by the special requirements of the social sciences.  For both\nWeber and Hayek, it was the reflection of a key difference between the\nGeisteswissenschaften and the\nNaturwissenschaften. Popper, however, denies that there are\nany significant methodological differences between the two. Indeed,\nhis initial discussion of methodological individualism in “The\nPoverty of Historicism,” occurs in a section called “The\nUnity of Method,” in which he claims that both are simply in the\nbusiness of “causal explanation, prediction and\ntesting.”(1945, 78). He goes on to deny that\n“understanding” plays any special role in the social\nsciences. \n\nThe problem that this creates for the doctrine of methodological\nindividualism is readily apparent. A social science that aims at\ninterpretation, or that uses interpretation as part of the centerpiece\nof its explanatory strategy, has a very clear methodological reason\nfor privileging explanations that refer to individual actions –\nsince it is precisely the underlying intentional states that serve as\nthe object of interpretation. But if social scientists are merely in\nthe business of providing causal explanations, just like natural\nscientists, then what is the rationale for privileging individual\nactions in these explanations? There no longer appears to be any\nmethodological reason for doing so.  Thus critics like Leon\nGoldstein (1958), and later Steven Lukes (1968), would argue that\nmethodological individualism was actually just an oblique way of\nasserting a commitment to metaphysical or ontological\nindividualism. In other words, Popper’s “methodological\nindividualism” was actually a claim about what the world\n“really” consisted of, little more than a fancy way of\nsaying “there is no such thing as society.” Watkins went\non to reinforce this impression by reformulating the thesis as the\nclaim that the “ultimate constituents of the social world are\nindividual people” (1957, 105). \n\nWatkins also provoked doubts about the methodological status of the\nprinciple by distinguishing between “unfinished or half-way\nexplanations” of social phenomena, which might not specify an\naction-theoretic or individualistic mechanism, and so-called\n“rock-bottom explanations,” which would (1957, 106). Yet\nin so doing, he grants that these half-way explanations (the example\nhe gives is the relationship between inflation and the unemployment\nrate), while they may not tell us everything we would like to know,\nneed not be meaningless or false. This creates problems, as Lars Udehn\npoints out, since the mere fact that one can explain social\nphenomena in terms of individuals “does not imply the\nmethodological rule that they should be explained this way”\n(2001, 216) – especially not if the “half-way”\nknowledge obtained is sufficient for our (extra-scientific)\npurposes. \n\nFinally, it should be noted that Popper introduced a contrast between\nmethodological individualism and “psychologism,” viz., the\nview that “all laws of social life must be ultimately reducible\nto the psychological laws of ‘human nature’”(1945,\n89).  Nevertheless, in Popper’s formulation, methodological\nindividualism does appear equivalent to at least some form of\npsychological reductionism. At very least, his formulation – and\nlater Watkins’s – left many commentators confused about how one\ncould affirm the former without committing to the latter (Udehn 2001,\n204). More generally, it created a great deal of confusion about the difference between methodological individualism and atomism (Hodgson 2007, 214). \n\nFor both Hayek and Popper, the primary motivation for respecting the\nprecepts of methodological individualism was to avoid “grand\ntheory” in the style of Auguste Comte, G.W.F. Hegel and Karl\nMarx. Yet the motivation for avoiding this sort of grand theory was\nnot so much that it promoted bad theory, but that it promoted habits\nof mind, such as “collectivism,”\n“rationalism,” or “historicism,” that were\nthought to be conducive to totalitarianism. Thus the sins of\n“collectivism,” and “collectivist” thought\npatterns, for both Hayek and Popper, were primarily political. Yet as\ntime wore on, and the dangers of creeping totalitarianism in Western\nsocieties became increasingly remote, the fear of collectivism that\nunderlay the debates over methodological individualism became\nincreasingly attenuated. \n\nThus the concern over methodological individualism began to fade away,\nand might have disappeared completely had it not been for the sudden\nexplosion of interest in game theory (or “rational choice\ntheory”) among social scientists in the 1980s. The reason for\nthis can be summed up in two words (and an article): the prisoner’s\ndilemma. Social scientists had always been aware that individuals in\ngroups are capable of getting stuck in patterns of collectively\nself-defeating behavior. Paul Samuelson’s “The Pure Theory of\nPublic Expenditure” (1954), Garrett Hardin’s “The Tragedy\nof the Commons,” (1968), and Mancur Olson’s The Logic of\nCollective Action (1965), had all provided very clear examples of\ncases where the mere existence of a common interest among individuals\nnevertheless failed to provide them with an incentive to perform the\nactions necessary to realize that interest. What the story of the\nprisoner’s dilemma – and more importantly, the accompanying game\nmatrix – provided was a simple yet powerful model that could be\nused to represent the structure of all these interactions (see\nR. Hardin 1982). \n\nThis in turn gave renewed impetus to methodological individualism,\nbecause it allowed theorists to diagnose with unparalleled precision\nthe errors that social theorists could be (and often were) led into if\nthey ignored the action-theoretic level of analysis. Methodological\nindividualism became important, not as a way of avoiding the political\nthought-crime of “collectivism,” but rather as a way of\navoiding demonstrably fallacious inferences about the dynamics of\ncollective action. For example, the traditional “interest\ngroup” theory of democratic politics generally presupposes that\ngroups who share a common interest also have an incentive to promote\nthat interest, by lobbying politicians, funding research, and so\non. Olson’s major contribution was to have driven home the point that\nthe existence of such a common interest just as often generates a\nfree-rider incentive. Individuals would benefit from acting to promote\nthat interest, but they would benefit even more by sitting\nback while the other members of the group acted to promote it. As a\nresult, no one may act to promote it.  However, Olson confined this\nobservation to large groups. The prisoner’s dilemma, on the other\nhand, demonstrated the ubiquity of this incentive structure. \n\nJon Elster’s contribution to the history of methodological\nindividualism must be understood against this background. He presents\nthe doctrine as part of a friendly yet trenchant critique of the use\nof functionalist explanations in the Marxist tradition; particularly\nthose that seek to explain events as ones that “serve the\ninterests of capital.” The problem with these explanations,\nElster argues, is that they “postulate a purpose without a\npurposive actor” (1982, 452), and therefore (he claims)\nentail a commitment to some form of objective teleology. In itself,\nthere is very little new in this criticism. As G.A. Cohen argued, in\nhis response to Elster, there is no reason that the Marxian\nfunctionalist cannot provide “elaborations” (Cohen 1982,\n131) of these explanations, ones that specify how the benefit\nproduced evokes the phenomenon, without reference to any objective\nteleology. This could be done either by appealing to an intentional\nmechanism at the action-theoretic level or else a Darwinian\n“selection” mechanism (Cohen 1982, 132).  In such cases,\nElster’s critique of functional explanation becomes just another\nversion of Watkins’s demand for “rock-bottom” rather than\n“half-way” explanations. \n\nThus what made Elster’s attack so forceful was not the accusation of\nobjective teleology in Marxist theory, but rather the suggestion that\nmuch of Marxian “class analysis” overlooked the potential\nfor collective action problems among the various world-historical\nactors. Consider, for example, the familiar claim that capitalists\nretain a “reserve army of the unemployed” in order to\ndepress wages. This means that individual capitalists must stop hiring\nnew workers at a point where marginal benefits still exceed the\nmarginal costs. What is their incentive for doing so? They have an\nobvious free-rider incentive to keep hiring, since the benefits\nstemming from depressed wages would largely be enjoyed by rival firms,\nwhereas the benefits of further hiring would flow to the bottom line.\nIn other words, the mere fact that it is in the “interests of\ncapital” to have a reserve army of the unemployed does not mean\nthat individual capitalists have an incentive to take the steps\nnecessary to maintain such a reserve army. \n\nAn even more disturbing consequence of the “rational\nchoice” perspective is the observation that the working class\nfaces a major collective action problem when it comes to carrying out\nthe socialist revolution (Elster 1982, 467). Fomenting revolution can\nbe dangerous business, and so absent some other incentive (such as\nclass solidarity), even workers who were convinced that a communist\neconomic order would offer them a superior quality of life might still\nfail to show up at the barricades. Yet these possibilities were\nlargely overlooked, Elster suggests, because the failure to respect the\nprecepts of methodological individualism, along with the promiscuous\nuse of functional explanation, had led generations of Marxian\ntheorists simply to ignore the actual incentives that individuals face\nin concrete social interactions.  \n\nBeyond the critique of functional explanations, Elster does not\nadvance any original argument in support of methodological\nindividualism. He does, however, return to the earlier Weberian\nformulation of the position, with its emphasis on intentional action\n(Elster 1982, 463): “The elementary unit of social life is the\nindividual human action,” he argues. “To explain social\ninstitutions and social change is to show how they arise as the result\nof the actions and interaction of individuals. This view, often\nreferred to as methodological individualism, is in my view trivially\ntrue” (Elster, 1989, 13). Here one must assume that when he says\n“trivially true,” he is using the term in the vernacular\nsense of “platitudinous” rather than the philosophical\nsense of “tautologous,” since he goes on to derive a\nnumber of very substantive doctrines from his commitment to\nmethodological individualism. For example, he goes on to claim at\nvarious points that methodological individualism commits him to\npsychologistic reductionism with respect to sociology (although he\ndoes not offer an argument for this claim).  \n\nElster does not draw as sharp a distinction as he might have\nbetween the commitment to methodological individualism and the\ncommitment to rational choice theory. Indeed, he also assumes that the\nlatter flows directly from the former. The version of rational choice\ntheory that Elster endorses, however, is one that is based upon a\ntraditional instrumental (or homo economicus) conception of\nrationality, according to which “actions are valued and chosen\nnot for themselves, but as more or less efficient means to the a\nfurther end” (Elster 1989, 22). He claims that this conception\nof rationality is implied by the fact that decision theorists are able\nto represent the rational actions of any agent possessing a\nwell-behaved preference ordering as the maximization of a utility\nfunction. Yet whether utility-maximization implies instrumentalism\ndepends upon the version of expected utility theory that one\nsubscribes to. So-called “world Bayesian” versions of\ndecision theory, such as Richard Jeffrey’s (1983) do not impose an\ninstrumental conception of rationality, since they permit agents to\nhave preferences over their own actions. Thus Elster’s move from\nmethodological individualism to the instrumental conception of\nrationality is based upon a non sequitur. \n\nNevertheless, as a result of Elster’s arguments, methodological\nindividualism became synonymous in many quarters with the commitment\nto rational choice theory. Such an equation generally fails to\ndistinguish what were for Weber two distinct methodological issues:\nthe commitment to providing explanations at an action-theoretic level,\nand the specific model of rational action that one proposes to use at\nthat level (i.e., the ideal type). There are multiple\npermutations. For instance, there is no reason that one cannot be a\nmethodological individualist while choosing to employ Habermas’s\ntheory of communicative action rather than rational choice theory as\nthe model of rational action. In fact, this would make greater sense,\nsince game theory, strictly construed, has never purported to offer a\ngeneral theory of rational action. The Nash solution concept, which\nprovides the standard definition of a game-theoretic equilibrium,\nspecifically excluded all forms of communication between the players\n(and the solution does not work in cases where communication does\nintrude [Heath 2001]). Thus much of the furor over rational choice\nimperialism has been based upon a failure to appreciate the\nlimitations of that model (in many cases both by its defenders and its\ncritics). \n\nIn the philosophy of mind, the phrase “methodological\nindividualism” is commonly associated with a claim made by Jerry\nFodor concerning the individuation of psychological states (1980,\n1987, 42). It is important to emphasize that Fodor’s use of the term\nhas nothing in common with its traditional use in the philosophy of\nsocial science. Fodor introduces it by way of a distinction between\n“methodological individualism” and “methodological\nsolipsism.” His goal is to deal with variations on the\ntwin-earth problem, introduced by Hilary Putnam. The question is\nwhether an individual with a belief about water on earth, where water\nis made up of H2O, has the same belief as an\nindividual with a belief about water in a parallel universe, where\nwater has the same appearance and behavior, but happens to be made up\nof XYZ. The “externalist” is one who says that they are\nnot the same, whereas an “internalist” like Fodor wants to\nsay that they are – speaking roughly, that the content of\nbeliefs is determined by what is in the agent’s head, and not what is\nin the world. \n\nThe issue comes down to one concerning the individuation of mental\nstates. How do we determine what is and is not the “same”\nbelief? Fodor begins by introducing the constraint that he calls\n“methodological individualism,” viz., “the doctrine\nthat psychological states are individuated with respect to their\ncausal powers” (1987, 42). This implies, among other\nthings, that if one psychological state is incapable of causing\nanything different to happen than some other psychological state, then\nthe two must be the same. “Methodological solipsism” is\nthe stronger claim that “psychological states are individuated\nwithout respect to the semantic evaluations” (1987,\n42). This implies, among other things, that even if one state is\n“true” in some context and another is “false,”\nthe two may still turn out to be the same. As Fodor goes on to point\nout, the semantic evaluation of a mental state will typically be\nrelational, e.g. whether certain beliefs about water are true will\ndepend upon how things happen to stand with water in the world; thus\nmethodological solipsism has the consequence of precluding one type of\nrelational property from playing a role in the individuation of mental\nstates. It is therefore “individualistic” in the everyday\nsense of the term, since it suggests that what’s going on in the\nagent’s head does most or all of the work in the individuation of\nmental states.  Methodological individualism, on the other hand,\n“does not prohibit the relational individuation of mental\nstates; it just says that no property of mental states,\nrelational or otherwise, counts taxonomically unless it affects causal\npowers”(1987, 42). Thus it is very unclear why Fodor chooses to\ncall this a form of “individualism,” since these relations\ncould also be relations to other speakers, and not just the physical\nword. \n\nThere is considerable infelicity in Fodor’s choice of terms. He is\nable to offer a cogent account of why methodological individualism\ncounts as a methodological constraint. He argues that the desire to\nalign terminological distinctions with objects having different causal\npowers is “one which follows simply from the scientist’s goal of\ncausal explanation and which, therefore, all scientific taxonomies\nmust obey” (1987, 42). Thus it is a methodological\nprecept. (Although one can see clearly here the stark contrast between\nFodor’s use of the term and that of Weber or Hayek, for whom the\nability of the social scientist to provide something beyond\nmerely causal explanation was what imposed the methodological\ncommitment to the action-theoretic level of analysis.) It is simply\nunclear why Fodor chooses to call it individualism. With\nmethodological solipsism, on the other hand, one can see why he calls\nit solipsism, but it is unclear what makes it methodological. Indeed,\nFodor goes on to state that “solipsism (construed as prohibiting\nthe relational taxonomy of mental states) is unlike individualism in\nthat it couldn’t conceivably follow from any general considerations\nabout scientific goals and practices. ‘Methodological\nsolipsism’ is, in fact, an empirical theory about the\nmind.”(1987, 43). Thus in Fodor’s use of the terms,\n“methodological individualism” is not really\nindividualistic, and “methodological solipsism” is not\nreally methodological. \n\nMuch of the critical discussion of methodological individualism in the\nphilosophy of social science concerns the relationship between what\nWatkins called “rock-bottom” explanations and\n“half-way” ones – or those that do and those that do\nnot specify an action theoretic mechanism. In general, there is no\nquestion that, given any particular half-way explanation of a social\nphenomenon, it would always be nice to know what agents are\nthinking, when they perform the actions that are involved in the\nproduction of that phenomenon. The question is whether the explanation\nis somehow deficient, or unscientific, in the absence of this\ninformation. The answer to that question will depend upon one’s\nbroader commitments concerning the status and role of the social\nsciences. Nevertheless, it is worth noting two very common types of\nsocial-scientific inquiry that fall short of providing the sort of\nrock-bottom explanations that methodological individualism\ndemands: \n\nConsider the following example of a social-scientific debate: During\nthe 1990s, there was a precipitous decline in violent crime in the\nUnited States. Many social scientists naturally began to apply\nthemselves to the question of why this had occurred, i.e., they set\nout to explain the phenomenon. A number of different hypotheses were\nadvanced: the hiring of more police, changes in community policing\npractices, more severe sentencing guidelines for offenders, decreased\ntolerance for minor infractions, an increase in religiosity, a decline\nin the popularity of crack, changes in the demographic profile of the\npopulation, etc. Since the decline in crime occurred in many different\njurisdictions, each using some different combination of strategies\nunder different circumstances, it is possible to build support for\ndifferent hypotheses through purely statistical analysis. For example,\nthe idea that policing strategies play an important role is\ncontradicted by the fact that New York City and San Francisco adopted\nvery different approaches to policing, and yet experienced a similar\ndecline in the crime rate. Thus a very sophisticated debate broke out,\nwith different social scientists producing different data sets, and\ncrunching the numbers in different ways, in support of their rival\nhypotheses. \n\nThis debate, like almost every debate in criminology, lacks\nmicrofoundations. It would certainly be nice to know what is going\nthrough people’s mind when they commit crimes, and thus how likely\nvarious measures are to change their behavior, but the fact is we do\nnot know. Indeed, there is considerable skepticism among\ncriminologists that a “general theory” of crime is\npossible. Nevertheless, we can easily imagine criminologists deciding\nthat one particular factor, such as a demographic shift in the\npopulation (i.e., fewer young men), is the explanation for\nthe late-20th century decline in violent crime in the\nUnited States, and ruling out the other hypotheses. And even though\nthis may be a “half-way” explanation, there is no question\nthat it would represent a genuine discovery, one that we could learn\nsomething important from. \n\nFurthermore, it is not obvious that the “rock-bottom”\nexplanation – the one that satisfies the precepts of\nmethodological individualism – is going to add anything very\ninteresting to the “half-way” explanation provided by the\nstatistical analysis. In many cases it will even be derived from\nit. Suppose that we discovered, through statistical analysis, that the\ncrime rate varied as a function of the severity of punishment\nmultiplied by the probability of apprehension. We would then infer\nfrom this that criminals were rational utility-maximizers. On the\nother hand, if studies showed that crime rates were completely\nunaffected by changes in the severity of punishments or the\nprobability of apprehension, we would infer that something else must\nbe going on at the action-theoretic level. \n\nResults at the action-theoretic level might also prove to be random or\nuninteresting, from the standpoint of the explanatory\nvariables. Suppose it turns out that the decline in crime can be\nexplained entirely by demographic change. Then it doesn’t really\nmatter what the criminals were thinking – what matters is simply\nthat a certain percentage of any given demographic group has the\nthoughts that lead to criminal behavior, so fewer of those people\ntranslates into less crime. The motives remain inside the “black\nbox” – and while it might to nice to know what those\nmotives are, they may not contribute anything to this particular\nexplanation. In the end, it may turn out that each crime is as unique\nas the criminal. So while there is a concrete explanation in terms of\nactual people’s intentional states, there is nothing that can be said\nat the level of a general “model” of rational action.  (In\nthis context, it is important to remember that methodological\nindividualism in the Weberian sense explains actions in terms of a\nmodel of the agent, not the actual motivations of the real\npeople.) \n\nConsider another social-scientific debate, this time the controversy\nover the data showing that stepparents have a far greater propensity\nto kill very young children in their care than biological\nparents. What would be involved in providing a rock-bottom explanation\nfor this phenomenon, one that satisfied the precepts of methodological\nindividualism? How informative would this be? It does not take much\neffort to imagine what people are thinking, when they shake a baby or\nhit a toddler. The motives are all-too familiar – almost\neveryone experiences episodes of intense frustration or anger when\ndealing with children. But that clearly does not explain the\nphenomenon. The question is why one group systematically fails to\nexercise control over these violent impulses, relative to some other\ngroup. Since very few people do it as part of a well-conceived plan,\nit is not clear that there is going to be an explanation available at\nthe level of intentional states, or even that a complementary account\nof what is going on at this level will be in the least bit\ninformative. The problem is that the behavior is generated by biases\nthat function almost entirely at a subintentional level (Sperber,\n1997). This suggests that an explanation in terms of intentional\nstates is not really “rock bottom,” but that there are\ndeeper layers to be explored. \n\nIt is not difficult to imagine how such an explanation might\nrun. People experience a reaction to juvenile (or neotenous)\ncharacteristics of the young that is largely involuntary. This\nreaction is very complex, but one of its central characteristics is\nthe inhibition of aggression. People are also quite poor at\narticulating the basis of this reaction, other than by repeated\nreferences to the fact that the child is “cute.” Of\ncourse, the overall strength of this reaction varies from individual\nto individual, and the particular strength varies with different\nchildren. Thus it is possible that biological parents simply find\ntheir own children “cuter” than stepparents do, and that\nthis translates into a slightly lower average propensity to commit\nacts of aggression against them. Because they are unable to articulate\nthe basis of this judgment, any analysis at the intentional level will\nsimply fail to provide much in the way of an explanation for their\nactions. \n\nFurthermore, it would seem that much “deeper” explanations\nof these behavioral tendencies are available. Most obviously, there is\nan evolutionary account available, which explains parental investment\nin terms of inclusive fitness (and also explains “new mate\ninfanticide” in terms of sexual selection).  Because of this,\nproponents of methodological individualism are open to the charge that\nthey are promoting half-way explanations, and that the evolutionary\nperspective offers rock-bottom ones. More generally, any theory that\npurports to explain the origin of our intentional states in terms of\ndeeper underlying causes, or that claims to explain much of human\nbehavior without reference to intentional states (such as Freudianism,\nwhich treats many of our beliefs as rationalizations, our desires as\nsublimations), will be unmoved by the methodological individualist’s\ndemand that pride of place be assigned to explanations formulated at\nthe action-theoretic level. \n\nChristian List and Kai Spiekermann (2013) have recently argued that\n“causal-explanatory holism” is called for in the social\nsciences under a very precise set of circumstances. Their general\nthought is that descriptions can usually be formulated at different\nlevels of generality, and that in certain circumstances it may be more\nilluminating to formulate explanations using concepts at a higher, rather\nthan a lower, level of generality. This is particularly so when a\nhigher-level property can be instantiated in various ways, but some\ncausal relation in which it is embedded continues to obtain regardless\nof the particular instantiation (a condition that they refer to as\n“microrealization-robustness”). This suggests that\nmethodological individualism will not be appropriate in cases where\n“social regularities are robust to changes in their\nindividual-level realization” (629). Under such conditions,\n“explanatory holism” is required. List and Spiekermann\nspecify three “jointly necessary and sufficient\nconditions” (639) under which this will be so: Multiple levels of description: The system admits\nlower and higher levels of description, associated with different\nlevel-specific properties (e.g. individual-level properties versus\naggregate properties). \n\nMultiple realizability of higher-level properties: The system’s\nhigher-level properties are determined by its lower-level properties,\nbut can be realized by numerous different configurations of them and\nhence cannot feasibly be redescribed in terms of lower-level\nproperties. \n\nMicrorealization-robust causal relations: The causal relations\nin which some of the system’s higher-level properties stand are robust\nto changes in their lower-level realization.  \n\nAn example they give is the “democratic peace hypothesis” (2013, 640),\nthat democracies do not go to war with one another. This is typically\nexplained in terms of internal structural features of democracies that\nprivilege norms of cooperation and compromise. There are, however, so\nmany ways of instantiating these features that an explanation at the\nlower level of description, such as that of the individual, would be\nunable to articulate the relevant causal relation. \n\nThe primary methodological reason, among social scientists, for adopting\na commitment to methodological individualism was to caution against\ncertain fallacies (ones that were quite common in 19th\ncentury social science). Perhaps the greatest of these fallacies was\nthe one based on a widespread tendency to ignore the potential for\ncollective action problems in groups, and thus to move far too easily\n“down” from an identification of a group interest to the\nascription of an individual interest. One way of avoiding such\nfallacies was to force social scientists to look always at\ninteractions from the participant’s perspective, to see what sort of\npreference structure governed his or her decisions. \n\nAt the same time, it is worth noting that too much emphasis on the\naction-theoretic perspective can generate its own fallacies. One of\nthe most powerful resources of sociological inquiry is precisely the\ncapacity to objectivate and aggregate social behavior using\nlarge-scale data collection and analysis. The analysis of\nsocial phenomena at this level can often generate results that are\ncounterintuitive from an action-theoretic perspective. Too much\nemphasis on the action-theoretic perspective, because of its proximity\nto common sense, can generate false assumptions about what must be\ngoing on at the aggregate level. As Arthur Stinchcombe observes in his\nclassic work, Constructing Social Theories, constructing\n“demographic explanations” of social phenomena often\nrequires a break with our everyday interpretive perspective. Too much\nfocus upon individual attitudes can lead us to make illegitimate\ngeneralizations about the characteristics of these attitudes in groups\n(1968, 67). For example, the stability of a belief in a population\nonly very rarely depends upon its stability in individuals. There can\nbe considerable volatility at the individual level, but so long as it\nruns with equal force both ways, its prevalence in the population will\nbe unchanged (68). If ten per cent of the population loses their faith\nin God every year, yet ten per cent have a conversion experience, then\nthere will be no change in the overall level of religiosity. This may\nseem obvious, but as Stinchcombe observes, it is “intuitively\ndifficult for many people” (67), and inattention to it is a\ncommon source of fallacious sociological thinking. \n\nIt is also worth noting that the action-theoretic level of analysis,\nwith its focus upon the intentional states of the agent, can generate\nconsiderable mischief when combined haphazardly with evolutionary\nreasoning. The most common fallacy arises when theorists treat the\n“self-interest” of the individual, defined with respect to\nhis or her preferences, as a stand-in for the “fitness” of\na particular behavior (or phenotype), at either the biological or the\ncultural level, then assumes that there is some selection mechanism in\nplace, again at either the biological or cultural level, that will\nweed out forms of behavior that fail to advance the individual’s\nself-interest. The problem is that neither biological nor cultural\nevolution function in this way. It is an elementary consequence of\n“selfish gene” theory that biological evolution does not\nadvance the interests of the agent (the most conspicuous example being\ninclusive fitness). For similar reasons, cultural evolution benefits\nthe “meme” rather than the interests of the agent\n(Stanovich 2004). Thus the evolutionary perspective imposes a much\ngreater break with the rationality-based perspective than many social\ntheorists appreciate. Thus methodological individualism can sometimes\nimpede the sort of radical objectivation of social phenomena that the\nuse of certain sociotheoretic models or tools requires.","contact.mail":"joseph.heath@utoronto.ca","contact.domain":"utoronto.ca"}]
