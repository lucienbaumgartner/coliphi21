From this it follows that all other apparent\npropositions are pseudo-propositions of various types and that all\nother uses of ‘true’ and ‘truth’ deviate\nmarkedly from the truth-by-correspondence (or agreement) that\ncontingent propositions have in relation to reality. Thus, from the\nTractatus to at least 1944, Wittgenstein maintains that\n“mathematical propositions” are not real propositions and\nthat “mathematical truth” is essentially non-referential\nand purely syntactical in nature. On Wittgenstein’s view, we\ninvent mathematical calculi and we expand mathematics by calculation\nand proof, and though we learn from a proof that a theorem\ncan be derived from axioms by means of certain rules in a\nparticular way, it is not the case that this proof-path\npre-exists our construction of it.\n\n\nAs we shall see, Wittgenstein’s Philosophy of Mathematics begins\nin a rudimentary way in the Tractatus, develops into a\nfinitistic constructivism in the middle period (Philosophical\nRemarks (1929–30) and Philosophical Grammar\n(1931–33), respectively; hereafter PR and PG,\nrespectively), and is further developed in new and old directions in\nthe manuscripts used for\nRemarks on the Foundations of Mathematics (1937–44;\nhereafter RFM). As Wittgenstein’s substantive views on\nmathematics evolve from 1918 through 1944, his writing and\nphilosophical styles evolve from the assertoric, aphoristic\nstyle of the Tractatus to a clearer, argumentative style in\nthe middle period, to a dialectical, interlocutory style in\nRFM and the Philosophical Investigations (hereafter\nPI).\n\nWittgenstein’s non-referential, formalist conception of\nmathematical propositions and terms begins in the\n Tractatus.[1]\n Indeed, insofar as he sketches a rudimentary Philosophy of\nMathematics in the Tractatus, he does so by\ncontrasting mathematics and mathematical equations with\ngenuine (contingent) propositions, sense, thought, propositional signs\nand their constituent names, and truth-by-correspondence. \nIn the Tractatus, Wittgenstein claims that a genuine\nproposition, which rests upon conventions, is used by us to assert\nthat a state of affairs (i.e., an elementary or atomic fact;\n‘Sachverhalt’) or fact (i.e., multiple states of\naffairs; ‘Tatsache’) obtain(s) in the one and\nonly real world. An elementary proposition is isomorphic to the\npossible state of affairs it is used to represent: it must\ncontain as many names as there are objects in the possible state of\naffairs. An elementary proposition is true iff its possible\nstate of affairs (i.e., its ‘sense’;\n‘Sinn’) obtains. Wittgenstein clearly states this\nCorrespondence Theory of Truth at (4.25):  \nIf an elementary proposition is true, the state of affairs exists; if\nan elementary proposition is false, the state of affairs does not\nexist.  \nBut propositions and their linguistic components are, in and of\nthemselves, dead—a proposition only has sense because we human\nbeings have endowed it with a conventional sense (5.473).\nMoreover, propositional signs may be used to do any number of\nthings (e.g., insult, catch someone’s attention); in order to\nassert that a state of affairs obtains, a person must\n‘project’ the proposition’s sense—its possible\nstate of affairs—by ‘thinking’ of (e.g., picturing)\nits sense as one speaks, writes or thinks the proposition (3.11).\nWittgenstein connects use, sense,\ncorrespondence, and truth by saying that “a\nproposition is true if we use it to say that things stand in\na certain way, and they do” (4.062; italics added). \nThe Tractarian conceptions of genuine (contingent)\npropositions and the (original and) core concept of truth are used to\nconstruct theories of logical and mathematical\n‘propositions’ by contrast. Stated boldly and\nbluntly, tautologies, contradictions and mathematical propositions\n(i.e., mathematical equations) are neither true nor false—we say\nthat they are true or false, but in doing so we use the words\n‘true’ and ‘false’ in very different senses\nfrom the sense in which a contingent proposition is true or false.\nUnlike genuine propositions, tautologies and contradictions\n“have no ‘subject-matter’” (6.124),\n“lack sense”, and “say nothing” about the\nworld (4.461), and, analogously, mathematical equations are\n“pseudo-propositions” (6.2) which, when ‘true’\n(‘correct’; ‘richtig’ (6.2321)),\n“merely mark … [the] equivalence of meaning [of\n‘two expressions’]” (6.2323). Given that\n“[t]autology and contradiction are the limiting\ncases—indeed the disintegration—of the\ncombination of signs” (4.466; italics added), where  \nthe conditions of agreement with the world—the representational\nrelations—cancel one another, so that [they] do[] not stand in\nany representational relation to reality,  \ntautologies and contradictions do not picture reality or possible\nstates of affairs and possible facts (4.462). Stated differently,\ntautologies and contradictions do not have sense, which means we\ncannot use them to make assertions, which means, in turn, that they\ncannot be either true or false. Analogously, mathematical\npseudo-propositions are equations, which indicate or show that two\nexpressions are equivalent in meaning and therefore are\nintersubstitutable. Indeed, we arrive at mathematical equations by\n“the method of substitution”:  \nstarting from a number of equations, we advance to new equations by\nsubstituting different expressions in accordance with the equations.\n(6.24)  \nWe prove mathematical ‘propositions’ ‘true’\n(‘correct’) by ‘seeing’ that two expressions\nhave the same meaning, which “must be manifest in the two\nexpressions themselves” (6.23), and by substituting one\nexpression for another with the same meaning. Just as “one can\nrecognize that [‘logical propositions’] are true from the\nsymbol alone” (6.113), “the possibility of proving”\nmathematical propositions means that we can perceive their correctness\nwithout having to compare “what they express” with facts\n(6.2321; cf. RFM App. III, §4). \nThe demarcation between contingent propositions, which can be used to\ncorrectly or incorrectly represent parts of the world, and\nmathematical propositions, which can be decided in a purely formal,\nsyntactical manner, is maintained by Wittgenstein until his death in\n1951 (Zettel §701, 1947; PI II, 2001 edition,\npp. 192–193e, 1949). Given linguistic and symbolic conventions,\nthe truth-value of a contingent proposition is entirely a function of\nhow the world is, whereas the “truth-value” of a\nmathematical proposition is entirely a function of its constituent\nsymbols and the formal system of which it is a part. Thus, a second,\nclosely related way of stating this demarcation is to say that\nmathematical propositions are decidable by purely formal means (e.g.,\ncalculations), while contingent propositions, being about the\n‘external’ world, can only be decided, if at all, by\ndetermining whether or not a particular fact obtains (i.e., something\nexternal to the proposition and the language in which it resides)\n(2.223; 4.05). \nThe Tractarian formal theory of mathematics is, specifically, a theory\nof formal operations. Over the past 20 years,\nWittgenstein’s theory of operations has received considerable\nexamination (Frascolla 1994, 1997; Marion 1998; Potter 2000; and Floyd\n2002), which has interestingly connected it and the Tractarian\nequational theory of arithmetic with elements of Alonzo Church’s\n\\(\\lambda\\)-calculus and with R. L. Goodstein’s equational\ncalculus (Marion 1998: chapters 1, 2, and 4). Very briefly stated,\nWittgenstein presents:  \nadding that “[t]he concept of number is… the general form\nof a number” (6.022). As Frascolla (and Marion after him) have\npointed out, “the general form of a proposition is a\nparticular case of the general form of an\n‘operation’” (Marion 1998: 21), and all three\ngeneral forms (i.e., of operation, proposition, and natural number)\nare modeled on the variable presented at (5.2522) (Marion 1998: 22).\nDefining “[a]n operation [as] the expression of a relation\nbetween the structures of its result and of its bases” (5.22),\nWittgenstein states that whereas “[a] function cannot be its own\nargument,… an operation can take one of its own results as its\nbase” (5.251). \nOn Wittgenstein’s (5.2522) account of ‘[\\(a, x, O \\spq\nx\\)]’,  \nthe first term of the bracketed expression is the beginning of the\nseries of forms, the second is the form of a term \\(x\\) arbitrarily\nselected from the series, and the third [\\(O \\spq x\\)] is the form of\nthe term that immediately follows \\(x\\) in the series.  \nGiven that “[t]he concept of successive applications of an\noperation is equivalent to the concept ‘and so on’”\n(5.2523), one can see how the natural numbers can be generated by\nrepeated iterations of the general form of a natural number, namely\n‘[\\(0, \\xi , \\xi +1\\)]’. Similarly, truth-functional\npropositions can be generated, as Russell says in the Introduction to\nthe Tractatus (p. xv), from the general form of a proposition\n‘[\\(\\overline{p}\\), \\(\\overline{\\xi}\\), \\(N(\\overline{\\xi})\\)]’ by\n \ntaking any selection of atomic propositions [where \\(p\\) “stands\nfor all atomic propositions”; “the bar over the variable\nindicates that it is the representative of all its values”\n(5.501)], negating them all, then taking any selection of the set of\npropositions now obtained, together with any of the originals [where\n\\(x\\) “stands for any set of propositions”]—and so\non indefinitely.  \nOn Frascolla’s (1994: 3ff) account,  \na numerical identity “\\(\\mathbf{t} = \\mathbf{s}\\)” is an\narithmetical theorem if and only if the corresponding equation\n“\\(\\Omega^t \\spq x = \\Omega^s \\spq x\\)”, which is framed\nin the language of the general theory of logical operations, can be\nproven.  \nBy proving  \nthe equation “\\(\\Omega^{2 \\times 2}\\spq x = \\Omega^{4}\\spq\nx\\)”, which translates the arithmetic identity “\\(2 \\times\n2 = 4\\)” into the operational language (6.241),  \nWittgenstein thereby outlines “a translation of numerical\narithmetic into a sort of general theory of operations”\n(Frascolla 1998: 135). \nDespite the fact that Wittgenstein clearly does not attempt\nto reduce mathematics to logic in either Russell’s manner or\nFrege’s manner, or to tautologies, and despite the fact that\nWittgenstein criticizes Russell’s Logicism (e.g., the Theory of\nTypes, 3.31–3.32; the Axiom of Reducibility, 6.1232, etc.) and\nFrege’s Logicism (6.031, 4.1272,\n etc.),[2]\n quite a number of commentators, early and recent, have interpreted\nWittgenstein’s Tractarian theory of mathematics as a variant of\nLogicism (Quine 1940 [1981: 55]; Benacerraf & Putnam 1964a: 14;\nBlack 1964: 340; Savitt\n1979 [1986: 34]; Frascolla 1994: 37; 1997: 354, 356–57, 361;\n1998: 133; Marion 1998: 26 & 29; and Potter 2000: 164 and\n182–183). There are at least four reasons proffered for this\ninterpretation. \nThough at least three Logicist interpretations of the\nTractatus have appeared within the last 20 years, the\nfollowing considerations (Rodych 1995; Wrigley 1998) indicate that\nnone of these reasons is particularly cogent. \nFor example, in saying that “[m]athematics is a method of\nlogic” perhaps Wittgenstein is only saying that since the\ngeneral form of a natural number and the general form of a proposition\nare both instances of the general form of a (purely formal) operation,\njust as truth-functional propositions can be constructed using the\ngeneral form of a proposition, (true) mathematical equations can be\nconstructed using the general form of a natural number. Alternatively,\nWittgenstein may mean that mathematical inferences (i.e., not\nsubstitutions) are in accord with, or make use of, logical inferences,\nand insofar as mathematical reasoning is logical reasoning,\nmathematics is a method of logic. \nSimilarly, in saying that “[t]he logic of the world” is\nshown by tautologies and true mathematical equations (i.e., #2),\nWittgenstein may be saying that since mathematics was invented to help\nus count and measure, insofar as it enables us to infer contingent\nproposition(s) from contingent proposition(s) (see 6.211 below), it\nthereby reflects contingent facts and “[t]he logic of\nthe world”. Though logic—which is inherent in natural\n(‘everyday’) language (4.002, 4.003, 6.124) and which has\nevolved to meet our communicative, exploratory, and survival\nneeds—is not invented in the same way, a valid logical\ninference captures the relationship between possible facts and a\nsound logical inference captures the relationship between\nexistent facts. \nAs regards #3, Black, Savitt, and Frascolla have argued that, since we\nascertain the truth of tautologies and mathematical equations without\nany appeal to “states of affairs” or “facts”,\ntrue mathematical equations and tautologies are so analogous\nthat we can “aptly” describe “the philosophy of\narithmetic of the Tractatus… as a kind of\nlogicism” (Frascolla 1994: 37). The rejoinder to this is that\nthe similarity that Frascolla, Black and Savitt recognize does not\nmake Wittgenstein’s theory a “kind of logicism” in\nFrege’s or Russell’s sense, because Wittgenstein does not\ndefine numbers “logically” in either Frege’s way or\nRussell’s way, and the similarity (or analogy) between\ntautologies and true mathematical equations is neither an identity nor\na relation of reducibility. \nFinally, critics argue that the problem with #4 is that there is no\nevidence for the claim that the relevant operation is logical\nin Wittgenstein’s or Russell’s or Frege’s sense of\nthe term—it seems a purely formal, syntactical operation. “Logical operations are performed with propositions,\narithmetical ones with numbers”, says Wittgenstein (WVC\n218); “[t]he result of a logical operation is a proposition, the\nresult of an arithmetical one is a number”. In sum, critics of\nthe Logicist interpretation of the Tractatus argue that\n##1–4 do not individually or collectively constitute cogent\ngrounds for a Logicist interpretation of the Tractatus. \nAnother crucial aspect of the Tractarian theory of\nmathematics is captured in (6.211). \nIndeed in real life a mathematical proposition is never what we want.\nRather, we make use of mathematical propositions only in\ninferences from propositions that do not belong to mathematics to\nothers that likewise do not belong to mathematics. (In philosophy the\nquestion, ‘What do we actually use this word or this proposition\nfor?’ repeatedly leads to valuable insights.) \nThough mathematics and mathematical activity are purely formal and\nsyntactical, in the Tractatus Wittgenstein tacitly\ndistinguishes between purely formal games with signs, which have no\napplication in contingent propositions, and mathematical propositions,\nwhich are used to make inferences from contingent proposition(s) to\ncontingent proposition(s). Wittgenstein does not explicitly say,\nhowever, how mathematical equations, which are not\ngenuine propositions, are used in inferences from genuine\nproposition(s) to genuine proposition(s) (Floyd 2002: 309; Kremer\n2002: 293–94). As we shall see in\n §3.5,\n the later Wittgenstein returns to the importance of\nextra-mathematical application and uses it to distinguish a mere\n“sign-game” from a genuine, mathematical\nlanguage-game. \nThis, in brief, is Wittgenstein’s Tractarian theory of\nmathematics. In the Introduction to the Tractatus, Russell\nwrote that Wittgenstein’s “theory of number”\n“stands in need of greater technical development”,\nprimarily because Wittgenstein had not shown how it could deal with\ntransfinite numbers (Russell 1922[1974]: xx).\nSimilarly, in his review of\nthe Tractatus, Frank Ramsey wrote that Wittgenstein’s\n‘account’ does not cover all of mathematics partly because\nWittgenstein’s theory of equations cannot explain inequalities\n(Ramsey 1923: 475). Though it is doubtful that, in 1923, Wittgenstein\nwould have thought these issues problematic, it certainly is true that\nthe Tractarian theory of mathematics is essentially a sketch,\nespecially in comparison with what Wittgenstein begins to develop six\nyears later. \nAfter the completion of the Tractatus in 1918, Wittgenstein\ndid virtually no philosophical work until February 2, 1929, eleven\nmonths after attending a lecture by the Dutch mathematician L.E.J.\nBrouwer. \nThere is little doubt that Wittgenstein was invigorated by L.E.J.\nBrouwer’s March 10, 1928 Vienna lecture “Science,\nMathematics, and Language” (Brouwer 1929), which he attended\nwith F. Waismann and H. Feigl, but it is a gross overstatement to say\nthat he returned to Philosophy because of this lecture or that his\nintermediate interest in the Philosophy of Mathematics issued\nprimarily from Brouwer’s influence. In fact,\nWittgenstein’s return to Philosophy and his intermediate work on\nmathematics is also due to conversations with Ramsey and members of\nthe Vienna Circle, to Wittgenstein’s disagreement with Ramsey\nover identity, and several other factors. \nThough Wittgenstein seems not to have read any Hilbert or Brouwer\nprior to the completion of the Tractatus, by early 1929\nWittgenstein had certainly read work by Brouwer, Weyl, Skolem, Ramsey\n(and possibly Hilbert) and, apparently, he had had one or more private\ndiscussions with Brouwer in 1928 (Finch 1977: 260; Van Dalen 2005:\n566–567). Thus, the rudimentary treatment of mathematics in the\nTractatus, whose principal influences were Russell and Frege,\nwas succeeded by detailed work on mathematics in the middle period\n(1929–1933), which was strongly influenced by the 1920s work of\nBrouwer, Weyl, Hilbert, and Skolem. \nTo best understand Wittgenstein’s intermediate Philosophy of\nMathematics, one must fully appreciate his strong variant of\nformalism, according to which “[w]e make\nmathematics” (WVC 34, note 1; PR §159) by\ninventing purely formal mathematical calculi, with\n‘stipulated’ axioms (PR §202), syntactical\nrules of transformation, and decision procedures that enable us to\ninvent “mathematical truth” and “mathematical\nfalsity” by algorithmically deciding so-called mathematical\n‘propositions’ (PR §§122, 162). \nThe core idea of Wittgenstein’s formalism from 1929 (if\nnot 1918) through 1944 is that mathematics is essentially syntactical,\ndevoid of reference and semantics. The most obvious aspect of this\nview, which has been noted by numerous commentators who do not refer\nto Wittgenstein as a ‘formalist’ (Kielkopf 1970:\n360–38; Klenk 1976: 5, 8, 9; Fogelin 1968: 267; Frascolla 1994:\n40; Marion 1998: 13–14), is that, contra Platonism, the\nsigns and propositions of a mathematical calculus do not\nrefer to anything. As Wittgenstein says at (WVC 34,\nnote 1), “[n]umbers are not represented by proxies; numbers\nare there”. This means not only that numbers are there\nin the use, it means that the numerals are the\nnumbers, for “[a]rithmetic doesn’t talk about numbers, it\nworks with numbers” (PR §109). \nWhat arithmetic is concerned with is the schema \\(||||\\).—But\ndoes arithmetic talk about the lines I draw with pencil on\npaper?—Arithmetic doesn’t talk about the lines, it\noperates with them. (PG 333) \nIn a similar vein, Wittgenstein says that (WVC 106)\n“mathematics is always a machine, a calculus” and\n“[a] calculus is an abacus, a calculator, a calculating\nmachine”, which “works by means of strokes, numerals,\netc”. The “justified side of formalism”, according\nto Wittgenstein (WVC 105), is that mathematical symbols\n“lack a meaning” (i.e.,\nBedeutung)—they do not “go proxy\nfor” things which are “their\nmeaning[s]”. \nYou could say arithmetic is a kind of geometry; i.e. what in geometry\nare constructions on paper, in arithmetic are calculations (on\npaper).—You could say it is a more general kind of geometry.\n(PR §109; PR §111) \nThis is the core of Wittgenstein’s life-long formalism. When we\nprove a theorem or decide a proposition, we operate in a purely\nformal, syntactical manner. In doing mathematics, we do\nnot discover pre-existing truths that were “already there\nwithout one knowing” (PG 481)—we invent\nmathematics, bit-by-little-bit. “If you want to know what \\(2 +\n2 = 4\\) means”, says Wittgenstein, “you have to ask how we\nwork it out”, because “we consider the process of\ncalculation as the essential thing” (PG 333). Hence,\nthe only meaning (i.e., sense) that a mathematical proposition has is\nintra-systemic meaning, which is wholly determined by its\nsyntactical relations to other propositions of the calculus. \nA second important aspect of the intermediate Wittgenstein’s\nstrong formalism is his view that extra-mathematical application\n(and/or reference) is not a necessary condition of a\nmathematical calculus. Mathematical calculi do not require\nextra-mathematical applications, Wittgenstein argues, since we\n“can develop arithmetic completely autonomously and its\napplication takes care of itself since wherever it’s applicable\nwe may also apply it” (PR §109; cf. PG\n308, WVC 104). \nAs we shall shortly see, the middle Wittgenstein is also drawn to\nstrong formalism by a new concern with questions of\ndecidability. Undoubtedly influenced by the writings of\nBrouwer and David Hilbert, Wittgenstein uses strong formalism to forge\na new connection between mathematical meaningfulness and algorithmic\ndecidability. \nAn equation is a rule of syntax. Doesn’t that explain why we\ncannot have questions in mathematics that are in principle\nunanswerable? For if the rules of syntax cannot be grasped,\nthey’re of no use at all…. [This] makes intelligible the\nattempts of the formalist to see mathematics as a game with signs.\n(PR §121) \nIn\n Section 2.3,\n we shall see how Wittgenstein goes beyond both Hilbert and Brouwer by\nmaintaining the Law of the Excluded Middle in a way that\nrestricts mathematical propositions to expressions that are\nalgorithmically decidable. \nThe single most important difference between the Early and Middle\nWittgenstein is that, in the middle period, Wittgenstein rejects\nquantification over an infinite mathematical domain, stating that,\ncontra his Tractarian view, such ‘propositions’\nare not infinite conjunctions and infinite disjunctions simply because\nthere are no such things. \nWittgenstein’s principal reasons for developing a\nfinitistic Philosophy of Mathematics are as follows. \nThese two reasons have at least five immediate consequences\nfor Wittgenstein’s Philosophy of Mathematics. \nSince we invent mathematics in its entirety, we do not\ndiscover pre-existing mathematical objects or facts or that\nmathematical objects have certain properties, for “one cannot\ndiscover any connection between parts of mathematics or logic that was\nalready there without one knowing” (PG 481). In\nexamining mathematics as a purely human invention, Wittgenstein tries\nto determine what exactly we have invented and why exactly, in his\nopinion, we erroneously think that there are infinite mathematical\nextensions. \nIf, first, we examine what we have invented, we see that we have\ninvented formal calculi consisting of finite extensions and\nintensional rules. If, more importantly, we endeavour to determine\nwhy we believe that infinite mathematical extensions exist\n(e.g., why we believe that the actual infinite is intrinsic to\nmathematics), we find that we conflate mathematical\nintensions and mathematical extensions, erroneously\nthinking that there is “a dualism” of “the law and\nthe infinite series obeying it” (PR §180). For\ninstance, we think that because a real number “endlessly yields\nthe places of a decimal fraction” (PR §186), it\nis “a totality” (WVC 81–82, note\n1), when, in reality, “[a]n irrational number isn’t the\nextension of an infinite decimal fraction,… it’s a\nlaw” (PR §181) which “yields\nextensions” (PR §186). A law and a list are\nfundamentally different; neither can ‘give’ what the other\ngives (WVC 102–103). Indeed, “the mistake in the\nset-theoretical approach consists time and again in treating laws and\nenumerations (lists) as essentially the same kind of thing”\n(PG 461). \nClosely related with this conflation of intensions and extensions is\nthe fact that we mistakenly act as if the word ‘infinite’\nis a “number word”, because in ordinary discourse we\nanswer the question “how many?” with both (PG\n463; cf. PR §142). But “‘[i]nfinite’\nis not a quantity”, Wittgenstein insists (WVC\n228); the word ‘infinite’ and a number word like\n‘five’ do not have the same syntax. The words\n‘finite’ and ‘infinite’ do not function as\nadjectives on the words ‘class’ or ‘set’,\n(WVC 102), for the terms “finite class” and\n“infinite class” use ‘class’ in completely\ndifferent ways (WVC 228). An infinite class is a recursive\nrule or “an induction”, whereas the symbol for a finite\nclass is a list or extension (PG 461). It is because an\ninduction has much in common with the multiplicity of a finite class\nthat we erroneously call it an infinite class (PR\n§158). \nIn sum, because a mathematical extension is necessarily a finite\nsequence of symbols, an infinite mathematical extension is a\ncontradiction-in-terms. This is the foundation of Wittgenstein’s\nfinitism. Thus, when we say, e.g., that “there are infinitely\nmany even numbers”, we are not saying “there are\nan infinite number of even numbers” in the same sense\nas we can say “there are 27 people in this house”; the\ninfinite series of natural numbers is nothing but “the infinite\npossibility of finite series of numbers”—“[i]t is\nsenseless to speak of the whole infinite number series, as if\nit, too, were an extension” (PR §144). The\ninfinite is understood rightly when it is understood, not as a\nquantity, but as an “infinite possibility” (PR\n§138). \nGiven Wittgenstein’s rejection of infinite mathematical\nextensions, he adopts finitistic, constructive views on mathematical\nquantification, mathematical decidability, the nature of real numbers,\nand Cantor’s diagonal proof of the existence of infinite sets of\ngreater cardinalities. \nSince a mathematical set is a finite extension, we cannot\nmeaningfully quantify over an infinite mathematical domain,\nsimply because there is no such thing as an infinite mathematical\ndomain (i.e., totality, set), and, derivatively, no such things as\ninfinite conjunctions or disjunctions (G.E. Moore 1955: 2–3; cf.\nAWL 6; and PG 281). \n[I]t still looks now as if the quantifiers make no sense for numbers.\nI mean: you can’t say ‘\\((n) \\phi n\\)’, precisely\nbecause ‘all natural numbers’ isn’t a bounded\nconcept. But then neither should one say a general proposition follows\nfrom a proposition about the nature of number. \nBut in that case it seems to me that we can’t use\ngenerality—all, etc.—in mathematics at all. There’s\nno such thing as ‘all numbers’, simply because there are\ninfinitely many. (PR §126; PR §129) \n‘Extensionalists’ who assert that\n“\\(\\varepsilon(0).\\varepsilon(1).\\varepsilon(2)\\) and so\non” is an infinite logical product (PG 452) assume or\nassert that finite and infinite conjunctions are close\ncousins—that the fact that we cannot write down or enumerate all\nof the conjuncts ‘contained’ in an infinite conjunction is\nonly a “human weakness”, for God could surely do so and\nGod could surely survey such a conjunction in a single glance and\ndetermine its truth-value. According to Wittgenstein, however, this is\nnot a matter of human limitation. Because we\nmistakenly think that “an infinite conjunction” is similar\nto “an enormous conjunction”, we erroneously reason that\njust as we cannot determine the truth-value of an enormous conjunction\nbecause we don’t have enough time, we similarly cannot, due to\nhuman limitations, determine the truth-value of an infinite\nconjunction (or disjunction). But the difference here is not one of\ndegree but of kind: “in the sense in which it is impossible to\ncheck an infinite number of propositions it is also impossible to try\nto do so” (PG 452). This applies, according to\nWittgenstein, to human beings, but more importantly, it applies also\nto God (i.e., an omniscient being), for even God cannot write down or\nsurvey infinitely many propositions because for him too the series is\nnever-ending or limitless and hence the ‘task’ is not a\ngenuine task because it cannot, in principle, be done (i.e.,\n“infinitely many” is not a number word). As Wittgenstein\nsays at (PR 128; cf. PG 479): “‘Can God\nknow all the places of the expansion of \\(\\pi\\)?’ would have\nbeen a good question for the schoolmen to ask”, for the question\nis strictly ‘senseless’. As we shall shortly see, on\nWittgenstein’s account, “[a] statement about all\nnumbers is not represented by means of a proposition, but by means of\ninduction” (WVC 82). \nSimilarly, there is no such thing as a mathematical proposition about\nsome number—no such thing as a mathematical proposition\nthat existentially quantifies over an infinite domain (PR\n§173). \nWhat is the meaning of such a mathematical proposition as\n‘\\((\\exists n) 4 + n = 7\\)’? It might be a\ndisjunction—\\((4 + 0 = 7) \\vee{}\\) \\((4 + 1 = 7) \\vee {}\\) etc. ad\ninf. But what does that mean? I can understand a proposition with\na beginning and an end. But can one also understand a proposition with\nno end? (PR §127) \nWe are particularly seduced by the feeling or belief that an infinite\nmathematical disjunction makes good sense in the case where\nwe can provide a recursive rule for generating each next member of an\ninfinite sequence. For example, when we say “There exists an odd\nperfect number” we are asserting that, in the infinite sequence\nof odd numbers, there is (at least) one odd number that is\nperfect—we are asserting ‘\\(\\phi(1) \\vee \\phi(3) \\vee\n\\phi(5) \\vee{}\\) and so on’ and we know what would make it true\nand what would make it false (PG 451). The mistake here made,\naccording to Wittgenstein (PG 451), is that we are implicitly\n“comparing the proposition\n‘\\((\\exists n)\\)…’ with the proposition…\n‘There are two foreign words on this page’”, which\ndoesn’t provide the grammar of the former\n‘proposition’, but only indicates an analogy in their\nrespective rules. \nOn Wittgenstein’s intermediate finitism, an expression\nquantifying over an infinite domain is never a meaningful\nproposition, not even when we have proved, for instance, that a\nparticular number \\(n\\) has a particular property. \nThe important point is that, even in the case where I am given that\n\\(3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2\\), I ought not to say ‘\\((\\exists x,\ny, z, n) (x^n + y^n = z^n)\\)’, since taken extensionally\nthat’s meaningless, and taken intensionally this doesn’t\nprovide a proof of it. No, in this case I ought to express only the\nfirst equation. (PR §150) \nThus, Wittgenstein adopts the radical position that all\nexpressions that quantify over an infinite domain, whether\n‘conjectures’ (e.g., Goldbach’s Conjecture, the Twin\nPrime Conjecture) or “proved general theorems” (e.g.,\n“Euclid’s Prime Number Theorem”, the Fundamental\nTheorem of Algebra), are meaningless (i.e.,\n‘senseless’; ‘sinnlos’) expressions\nas opposed to “genuine mathematical\nproposition[s]” (PR §168). These\nexpressions are not (meaningful) mathematical propositions, according\nto Wittgenstein, because the Law of the Excluded Middle does not\napply, which means that “we aren’t dealing with\npropositions of mathematics” (PR §151). The\ncrucial question why and in exactly what sense the Law of the\nExcluded Middle does not apply to such expressions will be answered in\nthe next section. \nThe middle Wittgenstein has other grounds for rejecting unrestricted\nquantification in mathematics, for on his idiosyncratic account, we\nmust distinguish between four categories of concatenations of\nmathematical symbols. \nIn his 2004 (p. 18), Mark van Atten says that … [i]ntuitionistically, there are four [“possibilities\nfor a proposition with respect to truth”]: \nWhat is immediately striking about Wittgenstein’s ##1–3\nand Brouwer’s ##1–3 (Brouwer 1955: 114; 1981: 92) is the\nenormous similarity. And yet, for all of the agreement, the\ndisagreement in #4 is absolutely crucial. \nAs radical as the respective #3s are, Brouwer and Wittgenstein agree\nthat an undecided \\(\\phi\\) is a mathematical proposition (for\nWittgenstein, of a particular mathematical calculus) if we\nknow of an applicable decision procedure. They also agree that until\n\\(\\phi\\) is decided, it is neither true nor false (though, for\nWittgenstein, ‘true’ means no more than “proved in\ncalculus \\(\\Gamma\\)”). What they disagree about is the status of\nan ordinary mathematical conjecture, such as Goldbach’s\nConjecture. Brouwer admits it as a mathematical proposition, while\nWittgenstein rejects it because we do not know how to algorithmically\ndecide it. Like Brouwer (1948 [1983: 90]), Wittgenstein holds that\nthere are no “unknown truth[s]” in mathematics, but unlike\nBrouwer he denies the existence of “undecidable\npropositions” on the grounds that such a\n‘proposition’ would have no ‘sense’,\n“and the consequence of this is precisely that the propositions\nof logic lose their validity for it” (PR §173). In\nparticular, if there are undecidable mathematical\npropositions (as Brouwer maintains), then at least some mathematical\npropositions are not propositions of any existent\nmathematical calculus. For Wittgenstein, however, it is a defining\nfeature of a mathematical proposition that it is either decided or\ndecidable by a known decision procedure in a mathematical\ncalculus. As Wittgenstein says at (PR §151),  \nwhere the law of the excluded middle doesn’t apply, no other law\nof logic applies either, because in that case we aren’t dealing\nwith propositions of mathematics. (Against Weyl and Brouwer).  \nThe point here is not that we need truth and falsity in\nmathematics—we don’t—but rather that every\nmathematical proposition (including ones for which an applicable\ndecision procedure is known) is known to be part of a\nmathematical calculus. \nTo maintain this position, Wittgenstein distinguishes between\n(meaningful, genuine) mathematical propositions, which have\nmathematical sense, and meaningless, senseless\n(‘sinnlos’) expressions by stipulating that an\nexpression is a meaningful (genuine) proposition of a mathematical\ncalculus iff we know of a proof, a refutation, or an\napplicable decision procedure (PR §151; PG 452;\nPG 366; AWL 199–200). “Only where\nthere’s a method of solution [a ‘logical method for\nfinding a solution’] is there a [mathematical] problem”,\nhe tells us (PR §§149, 152; PG 393).\n“We may only put a question in mathematics (or make a\nconjecture)”, he adds (PR §151), “where the\nanswer runs: ‘I must work it out’”. \nAt (PG 468), Wittgenstein emphasizes the importance of\nalgorithmic decidability clearly and emphatically:  \nIn mathematics everything is algorithm and nothing\nis meaning [Bedeutung]; even when it\ndoesn’t look like that because we seem to be using\nwords to talk about mathematical things. Even these\nwords are used to construct an algorithm.  \nWhen, therefore, Wittgenstein says (PG 368) that if\n“[the Law of the Excluded Middle] is supposed not to hold, we\nhave altered the concept of proposition”, he means that an\nexpression is only a meaningful mathematical proposition if we\nknow of an applicable decision procedure for deciding it\n(PG 400). If a genuine mathematical proposition is\nundecided, the Law of the Excluded Middle holds in the sense\nthat we know that we will prove or refute the\nproposition by applying an applicable decision procedure (PG\n379, 387). \nFor Wittgenstein, there simply is no distinction between syntax and\nsemantics in mathematics: everything is syntax. If we wish to\ndemarcate between “mathematical propositions” versus\n“mathematical pseudo-propositions”, as we do, then the\nonly way to ensure that there is no such thing as a\nmeaningful, but undecidable (e.g., independent), proposition\nof a given calculus is to stipulate that an expression is only a\nmeaningful proposition in a given calculus (PR\n§153) if either it has been decided or we know of an\napplicable decision procedure. In this manner, Wittgenstein defines\nboth a mathematical calculus and a mathematical\nproposition in epistemic terms. A calculus is defined in\nterms of stipulations (PR §202; PG 369),\nknown rules of operation, and known decision\nprocedures, and an expression is only a mathematical proposition\nin a given calculus (PR §155), and only if that\ncalculus contains (PG 379) a known (and applicable)\ndecision procedure, for “you cannot have a logical plan of\nsearch for a sense you don’t know” (PR\n§148). \nThus, the middle Wittgenstein rejects undecidable mathematical\npropositions on two grounds. First, number-theoretic\nexpressions that quantify over an infinite domain are not\nalgorithmically decidable, and hence are not meaningful mathematical\npropositions. \nIf someone says (as Brouwer does) that for \\((x) f_1 x = f_2 x\\),\nthere is, as well as yes and no, also the case of undecidability, this\nimplies that ‘\\((x)\\)…’ is meant extensionally and\nwe may talk of the case in which all \\(x\\) happen to have a property.\nIn truth, however, it’s impossible to talk of such a case at all\nand the ‘\\((x)\\)…’ in arithmetic cannot be taken\nextensionally. (PR §174) \n“Undecidability”, says Wittgenstein (PR\n§174) “presupposes… that the bridge cannot\nbe made with symbols”, when, in fact, “[a] connection\nbetween symbols which exists but cannot be represented by symbolic\ntransformations is a thought that cannot be thought”, for\n“[i]f the connection is there,… it must be possible to\nsee it”. Alluding to algorithmic decidability, Wittgenstein\nstresses (PR §174) that “[w]e can assert anything\nwhich can be checked in practice”, because\n“it’s a question of the possibility of\nchecking” (italics added). \nWittgenstein’s second reason for rejecting an undecidable\nmathematical proposition is that it is a\ncontradiction-in-terms. There cannot be “undecidable\npropositions”, Wittgenstein argues (PR §173),\nbecause an expression that is not decidable in some actual\ncalculus is simply not a mathematical proposition, since\n“every proposition in mathematics must belong to a calculus of\nmathematics” (PG 376). \nThis radical position on decidability results in various radical and\ncounter-intuitive statements about unrestricted mathematical\nquantification, mathematical induction, and, especially, the\nsense of a newly proved mathematical proposition. In\nparticular, Wittgenstein asserts that uncontroversial mathematical\nconjectures, such as Goldbach’s Conjecture (hereafter\n‘GC’) and the erstwhile conjecture “Fermat’s\nLast Theorem” (hereafter ‘FLT’), have no sense (or,\nperhaps, no determinate sense) and that the\nunsystematic proof of such a conjecture gives it a sense that\nit didn’t previously have (PG 374) because  \nit’s unintelligible that I should admit, when I’ve got the\nproof, that it’s a proof of precisely this proposition,\nor of the induction meant by this proposition. (PR\n§155) \nThus Fermat’s [Last Theorem] makes no sense until I can\nsearch for a solution to the equation in cardinal numbers.\nAnd ‘search’ must always mean: search systematically.\nMeandering about in infinite space on the look-out for a gold ring is\nno kind of search. (PR §150) \nI say: the so-called ‘Fermat’s Last Theorem’\nisn’t a proposition. (Not even in the sense of a proposition of\narithmetic.) Rather, it corresponds to an induction. (PR\n§189) \nTo see how Fermat’s Last Theorem isn’t a proposition and\nhow it might correspond to an induction, we need to examine\nWittgenstein’s account of mathematical induction. \nGiven that one cannot quantify over an infinite mathematical domain,\nthe question arises: What, if anything, does any\nnumber-theoretic proof by mathematical induction actually\nprove? \nOn the standard view, a proof by mathematical induction has the\nfollowing paradigmatic form. \nIf, however, “\\(\\forall n\\phi(n)\\)” is not a\nmeaningful (genuine) mathematical proposition, what are we to make of\nthis proof? \nWittgenstein’s initial answer to this question is decidedly\nenigmatic. “An induction is the expression for arithmetical\ngenerality”, but “induction isn’t itself a\nproposition” (PR §129). \nWe are not saying that when \\(f(1)\\) holds and when \\(f(c + 1)\\)\nfollows from \\(f(c)\\), the proposition \\(f(x)\\) is therefore\ntrue of all cardinal numbers: but: “the proposition \\(f(x)\\)\nholds for all cardinal numbers” means “it holds\nfor \\(x = 1\\), and \\(f(c + 1)\\) follows from \\(f(c)\\)”.\n(PG 406) \nIn a proof by mathematical induction, we do no actually prove the\n‘proposition’ [e.g., \\(\\forall n\\phi(n)\\)] that is\ncustomarily construed as the conclusion of the proof\n(PG 406, 374; PR §164), rather this\npseudo-proposition or ‘statement’ stands\n‘proxy’ for the “infinite possibility” (i.e.,\n“the induction”) that we come to\n‘see’ by means of the proof (WVC 135).\n“I want to say”, Wittgenstein concludes, that “once\nyou’ve got the induction, it’s all over”\n(PG 407). Thus, on Wittgenstein’s account, a particular\nproof by mathematical induction should be understood in the following\nway. \nHere the ‘conclusion’ of an inductive proof [i.e.,\n“what is to be proved” (PR §164)] uses\n‘\\(m\\)’ rather than ‘\\(n\\)’ to indicate that\n‘\\(m\\)’ stands for any particular number, while\n‘\\(n\\)’ stands for any arbitrary number. For\nWittgenstein, the proxy statement “\\(\\phi(m)\\)”\nis not a mathematical proposition that “assert[s] its\ngenerality” (PR §168), it is an\neliminable pseudo-proposition standing proxy for the proved\ninductive base and inductive step. Though an inductive proof\ncannot prove “the infinite possibility of\napplication” (PR §163), it enables us “to\nperceive” that a direct proof of any\nparticular proposition can be constructed (PR\n§165). For example, once we have proved “\\(\\phi(1)\\)”\nand “\\(\\phi(n) \\rightarrow \\phi(n + 1)\\)”, we need not\nreiterate modus ponens \\(m - 1\\) times to prove the\nparticular proposition “\\(\\phi(m)\\)” (PR\n§164). The direct proof of, say, “\\(\\phi\\)(714)”\n(i.e., without 713 iterations of modus ponens) “cannot\nhave a still better proof, say, by my carrying out the derivation as\nfar as this proposition itself” (PR §165). \nA second, very important impetus for Wittgenstein’s radically\nconstructivist position on mathematical induction is his rejection of\nan undecidable mathematical proposition. \nIn discussions of the provability of mathematical propositions it is\nsometimes said that there are substantial propositions of mathematics\nwhose truth or falsehood must remain undecided. What the people who\nsay that don’t realize is that such propositions, if we\ncan use them and want to call them “propositions”, are not\nat all the same as what are called “propositions” in other\ncases; because a proof alters the grammar of a proposition.\n(PG 367) \nIn this passage, Wittgenstein is alluding to Brouwer, who, as early as\n1907 and 1908, states, first, that “the question of the validity\nof the principium tertii exclusi is equivalent to the question\nwhether unsolvable mathematical problems exist”,\nsecond, that “[t]here is not a shred of a proof for the\nconviction… that there exist no unsolvable mathematical\nproblems”, and, third, that there are meaningful\npropositions/‘questions’, such as “Do there\noccur in the decimal expansion of \\(\\pi\\) infinitely many pairs of\nconsecutive equal digits?”, to which the Law of the\nExcluded Middle does not apply because “it must be\nconsidered as uncertain whether problems like [this] are\nsolvable” (Brouwer, 1908 [1975: 109–110]). “A\nfortiori it is not certain that any mathematical problem can either be\nsolved or proved to be unsolvable”, Brouwer says (1907 [1975:\n79]), “though HILBERT, in ‘Mathematische Probleme’,\nbelieves that every mathematician is deeply convinced of\nit”. \nWittgenstein takes the same data and, in a way, draws the opposite\nconclusion. If, as Brouwer says, we are uncertain whether all\nor some “mathematical problems” are solvable, then we\nknow that we do not have in hand an applicable\ndecision procedure, which means that the alleged mathematical\npropositions are not decidable, here and now. “What\n‘mathematical questions’ share with genuine\nquestions”, Wittgenstein says (PR §151), “is\nsimply that they can be answered”. This means that if we do not\nknow how to decide an expression, then we do not know how to\nmake it either proved (true) or refuted (false), which means\nthat the Law of the Excluded Middle “doesn’t apply”\nand, therefore, that our expression is not a mathematical\nproposition. \nTogether, Wittgenstein’s finitism and his criterion of\nalgorithmic decidability shed considerable light on his highly\ncontroversial remarks about putatively meaningful conjectures\nsuch as FLT and GC. GC is not a mathematical proposition because we do\nnot know how to decide it, and if someone like G. H. Hardy\nsays that he ‘believes’ GC is true (PG 381;\nLFM 123; PI §578), we must answer that s/he\nonly “has a hunch about the possibilities of extension of the\npresent system” (LFM 139)—that one can only\nbelieve such an expression is ‘correct’ if one\nknows how to prove it. The only sense in which GC (or FLT)\ncan be proved is that it can “correspond to a proof by\ninduction”, which means that the unproved inductive step (e.g.,\n“\\(G(n) \\rightarrow G(n + 1)\\)”) and the expression\n“\\(\\forall nG(n)\\)” are not mathematical propositions\nbecause we have no algorithmic means of looking for an induction\n(PG 367). A “general proposition” is senseless\nprior to an inductive proof “because the question would only\nhave made sense if a general method of decision had been known\nbefore the particular proof was discovered”\n(PG 402). Unproved ‘inductions’ or inductive\nsteps are not meaningful propositions because the Law of the Excluded\nMiddle does not hold in the sense that we do not know of a decision\nprocedure by means of which we can prove or refute the expression\n(PG 400; WVC 82). \nThis position, however, seems to rob us of any reason to search for a\n‘decision’ of a meaningless ‘expression’ such\nas GC. The intermediate Wittgenstein says only that “[a]\nmathematician is… guided by… certain analogies with the\nprevious system” and that there is nothing “wrong or\nillegitimate if anyone concerns himself with Fermat’s Last\nTheorem” (WVC 144). \nIf e.g. I have a method for looking at integers that satisfy the\nequation \\(x^2 + y^2 = z^2\\), then the formula \\(x^{n} + y^n = z^{n}\\)\nmay stimulate me. I may let a formula stimulate me. Thus I shall say,\nHere there is a stimulus—but not a question.\nMathematical problems are always such stimuli. (WVC 144, Jan.\n1, 1931) \nMore specifically, a mathematician may let a senseless conjecture such\nas FLT stimulate her/him if s/he wishes to know whether a calculus can\nbe extended without altering its axioms or rules (LFM\n139). \nWhat is here going [o]n [in an attempt to decide GC] is an\nunsystematic attempt at constructing a calculus. If the attempt is\nsuccessful, I shall again have a calculus in front of me, only a\ndifferent one from the calculus I have been using so far.\n(WVC 174–75; Sept. 21, 1931; italics added) \nIf, e.g., we succeed in proving GC by mathematical induction (i.e., we\nprove “\\(G(1)\\)” and “\\(G(n) \\rightarrow G(n +\n1)\\)”), we will then have a proof of the inductive step, but\nsince the inductive step was not algorithmically decidable beforehand\n(PR §§148, 155, 157; PG 380), in\nconstructing the proof we have constructed a new calculus, a\nnew calculating machine (WVC 106) in which we\nnow know how to use this new “machine-part”\n(RFM VI, §13) (i.e., the unsystematically proved\ninductive step). Before the proof, the inductive step is not a\nmathematical proposition with sense (in a particular calculus),\nwhereas after the proof the inductive step is a mathematical\nproposition, with a new, determinate sense, in a newly created\ncalculus. This demarcation of expressions without mathematical sense\nand proved or refuted propositions, each with a determinate sense in a\nparticular calculus, is a view that Wittgenstein articulates in myriad\ndifferent ways from 1929 through 1944. \nWhether or not it is ultimately defensible—and this is an\nabsolutely crucial question for Wittgenstein’s Philosophy of\nMathematics—this strongly counter-intuitive aspect of\nWittgenstein’s account of algorithmic decidability, proof, and\nthe sense of a mathematical proposition is a piece with his\nrejection of predeterminacy in mathematics. Even in the case\nwhere we algorithmically decide a mathematical proposition, the\nconnections thereby made do not pre-exist the algorithmic decision,\nwhich means that even when we have a “mathematical\nquestion” that we decide by decision procedure, the expression\nonly has a determinate sense qua proposition when it is\ndecided. On Wittgenstein’s account, both middle and later,\n“[a] new proof gives the proposition a place in a new\nsystem” (RFM VI, §13), it “locates it in the\nwhole system of calculations”, though it “does not\nmention, certainly does not describe, the whole system of calculation\nthat stands behind the proposition and gives it sense”\n(RFM VI, §11). \nWittgenstein’s unorthodox position here is a type of\nstructuralism that partially results from his rejection of\nmathematical semantics. We erroneously think, e.g., that GC has a\nfully determinate sense because, given “the misleading way in\nwhich the mode of expression of word-language represents the sense of\nmathematical propositions” (PG 375), we call to mind\nfalse pictures and mistaken, referential conceptions of\nmathematical propositions whereby GC is about a mathematical\nreality and so has just a determinate sense as “There exist\nintelligent beings elsewhere in the universe” (i.e., a\nproposition that is determinately true or false, whether or\nnot we ever know its truth-value). Wittgenstein breaks with this\ntradition, in all of its forms, stressing that, in\nmathematics, unlike the realm of contingent (or empirical)\npropositions, “if I am to know what a proposition like\nFermat’s last theorem says”, I must know its\ncriterion of truth. Unlike the criterion of truth for an\nempirical proposition, which can be known before the\nproposition is decided, we cannot know the criterion of truth for an\nundecided mathematical proposition, though we are “acquainted\nwith criteria for the truth of similar propositions”\n(RFM VI, §13). \nThe intermediate Wittgenstein spends a great deal of time wrestling\nwith real and irrational numbers. There are two distinct reasons for\nthis. \nFirst, the real reason many of us are unwilling to abandon\nthe notion of the actual infinite in mathematics is the prevalent\nconception of an irrational number as a necessarily infinite\nextension. “The confusion in the concept of the ‘actual\ninfinite’ arises” (italics added), says\nWittgenstein (PG 471),  \nfrom the unclear concept of irrational number, that is, from the fact\nthat logically very different things are called ‘irrational\nnumbers’ without any clear limit being given to the concept. \nSecond, and more fundamentally, the intermediate Wittgenstein wrestles\nwith irrationals in such detail because he opposes foundationalism and\nespecially its concept of a “gapless mathematical\ncontinuum”, its concept of a comprehensive theory of\nthe real numbers (Han 2010), and set theoretical conceptions and\n‘proofs’ as a foundation for arithmetic, real number\ntheory, and mathematics as a whole. Indeed, Wittgenstein’s\ndiscussion of irrationals is one with his critique of set theory, for,\nas he says, “[m]athematics is ridden through and through with\nthe pernicious idioms of set theory”, such as “the way\npeople speak of a line as composed of points”, when, in fact,\n“[a] line is a law and isn’t composed of anything at\nall” (PR §173; PR §§181, 183,\n& 191; PG 373, 460, 461, & 473). \nSince, on Wittgenstein’s terms, mathematics consists exclusively\nof extensions and intensions (i.e., ‘rules’ or\n‘laws’), an irrational is only an extension insofar as it\nis a sign (i.e., a ‘numeral’, such as\n‘\\(\\sqrt{2}\\)’ or ‘\\(\\pi\\)’). Given that there\nis no such thing as an infinite mathematical extension, it\nfollows that an irrational number is not a unique infinite\nexpansion, but rather a unique recursive rule or law\n(PR §181) that yields rational numbers (PR\n§186; PR §180). \nThe rule for working out places of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is itself the numeral\nfor the irrational number; and the reason I here speak of a\n‘number’ is that I can calculate with these signs (certain\nrules for the construction of rational numbers) just as I can with\nrational numbers themselves. (PG 484) \nDue, however, to his anti-foundationalism, Wittgenstein takes the\nradical position that not all recursive real numbers (i.e., computable\nnumbers) are genuine real numbers—a position that distinguishes\nhis view from even Brouwer’s. \nThe problem, as Wittgenstein sees it, is that mathematicians,\nespecially foundationalists (e.g., set theorists), have sought to\naccommodate physical continuity by a theory that\n‘describes’ the mathematical continuum (PR\n§171). When, for example, we think of continuous motion and the\n(mere) density of the rationals, we reason that if an object moves\ncontinuously from A to B, and it travels only the distances\nmarked by “rational points”, then it must skip\nsome distances (intervals, or points) not marked by rational\nnumbers. But if an object in continuous motion travels distances that\ncannot be commensurately measured by rationals alone, there\nmust be ‘gaps’ between the rationals (PG 460),\nand so we must fill them, first, with recursive irrationals, and then,\nbecause “the set of all recursive irrationals”\nstill leaves gaps, with “lawless irrationals”. \n[T]he enigma of the continuum arises because language misleads us into\napplying to it a picture that doesn’t fit. Set theory preserves\nthe inappropriate picture of something discontinuous, but makes\nstatements about it that contradict the picture, under the impression\nthat it is breaking with prejudices; whereas what should really have\nbeen done is to point out that the picture just doesn’t\nfit… (PG 471) \nWe add nothing that is needed to the differential and integral calculi\nby ‘completing’ a theory of real numbers with\npseudo-irrationals and lawless irrationals, first because there are no\ngaps on the number line (PR §§181, 183, & 191;\nPG 373, 460, 461, & 473; WVC 35) and, second,\nbecause these alleged irrational numbers are not needed for a theory\nof the ‘continuum’ simply because there is no mathematical\ncontinuum. As the later Wittgenstein says (RFM V, §32),\n“[t]he picture of the number line is an absolutely natural one\nup to a certain point; that is to say so long as it is not used for a\ngeneral theory of real numbers”. We have gone awry by\nmisconstruing the nature of the geometrical line as a continuous\ncollection of points, each with an associated real number, which has\ntaken us well beyond the ‘natural’ picture of the number\nline in search of a “general theory of real numbers” (Han\n2010). \nThus, the principal reason Wittgenstein rejects certain constructive\n(computable) numbers is that they are unnecessary creations which\nengender conceptual confusions in mathematics (especially set theory).\nOne of Wittgenstein’s main aims in his lengthy discussions of\nrational numbers and pseudo-irrationals is to show that\npseudo-irrationals, which are allegedly needed for the mathematical\ncontinuum, are not needed at all. \nTo this end, Wittgenstein demands (a) that a real number must be\n“compar[able] with any rational number taken at random”\n(i.e., “it can be established whether it is greater than, less\nthan, or equal to a rational number” (PR §191))\nand (b) that “[a] number must measure in and of itself”\nand if a ‘number’ “leaves it to the rationals, we\nhave no need of it” (PR §191) (Frascolla 1980:\n242–243; Shanker 1987: 186–192; Da Silva 1993:\n93–94; Marion 1995a: 162, 164; Rodych 1999b, 281–291;\nLampert 2009). \nTo demonstrate that some recursive (computable) reals are not genuine\nreal numbers because they fail to satisfy (a) and (b), Wittgenstein\ndefines the putative recursive real number \nas the rule “Construct the decimal expansion for \\(\\sqrt{2}\\),\nreplacing every occurrence of a ‘5’ with a\n‘3’” (PR §182); he similarly defines\n\\(\\pi '\\) as \n(PR §186) and, in a later work, redefines \\(\\pi '\\)\nas \n(PG 475). \nAlthough a pseudo-irrational such as \\(\\pi '\\) (on either definition)\nis “as unambiguous as … \\(\\pi\\) or \\(\\sqrt{2}\\)”\n(PG 476), it is ‘homeless’ according to\nWittgenstein because, instead of using “the idioms of\narithmetic” (PR §186), it is dependent upon the\nparticular ‘incidental’ notation of a particular system\n(i.e., in some particular base) (PR §188; PR\n§182; and PG 475). If we speak of various\nbase-notational systems, we might say that \\(\\pi\\) belongs to\nall systems, while \\(\\pi '\\) belongs only to one, which shows\nthat \\(\\pi '\\) is not a genuine irrational because “there\ncan’t be irrational numbers of different types”\n(PR §180). Furthermore, pseudo-irrationals do\nnot measure because they are homeless, artificial\nconstructions parasitic upon numbers which have a natural place in a\ncalculus that can be used to measure. We simply do not need these\naberrations, because they are not sufficiently comparable to rationals\nand genuine irrationals. They are not irrational numbers\naccording to Wittgenstein’s criteria, which define, Wittgenstein\ninterestingly asserts, “precisely what has been meant or looked\nfor under the name ‘irrational number’” (PR\n§191). \nFor exactly the same reason, if we define a “lawless\nirrational” as either (a) a non-rule-governed,\nnon-periodic, infinite expansion in some base, or (b) a\n“free-choice sequence”, Wittgenstein rejects\n“lawless irrationals” because, insofar as they are not\nrule-governed, they are not comparable to rationals (or irrationals)\nand they are not needed.  \n[W]e cannot say that the decimal fractions developed in accordance\nwith a law still need supplementing by an infinite set of irregular\ninfinite decimal fractions that would be ‘brushed under the\ncarpet’ if we were to restrict ourselves to those\ngenerated by a law,  \nWittgenstein argues, for “[w]here is there such an infinite\ndecimal that is generated by no law” “[a]nd how would we\nnotice that it was missing?” (PR §181; cf.\nPG 473, 483–84). Similarly, a free-choice sequence,\nlike a recipe for “endless bisection” or “endless\ndicing”, is not an infinitely complicated mathematical\nlaw (or rule), but rather no law at all, for after each\nindividual throw of a coin, the point remains “infinitely\nindeterminate” (PR §186). For closely related\nreasons, Wittgenstein ridicules the Multiplicative Axiom (Axiom of\nChoice) both in the middle period (PR §146) and in the\nlatter period (RFM V, §25; VII, §33). \nSuperficially, at least, it seems as if Wittgenstein is offering an\nessentialist argument for the conclusion that real number arithmetic\nshould not be extended in such-and-such a way. Such an\nessentialist account of real and irrational numbers seems to\nconflict with the actual freedom mathematicians have to extend and\ninvent, with Wittgenstein’s intermediate claim (PG 334)\nthat “[f]or [him] one calculus is as good as another”, and\nwith Wittgenstein’s acceptance of complex and imaginary numbers.\nWittgenstein’s foundationalist critic (e.g., set theorist) will\nundoubtedly say that we have extended the term “irrational\nnumber” to lawless and pseudo-irrationals because they are\nneeded for the mathematical continuum and because such\n“conceivable numbers” are much more like rule-governed\nirrationals than rationals. \nThough Wittgenstein stresses differences where others see similarities\n(LFM 15), in his intermediate attacks on pseudo-irrationals\nand foundationalism, he is not just emphasizing differences, he is\nattacking set theory’s “pernicious idioms”\n(PR §173) and its “crudest imaginable\nmisinterpretation of its own calculus” (PG\n469–70) in an attempt to dissolve “misunderstandings\nwithout which [set theory] would never have been invented”,\nsince it is “of no other use” (LFM 16–17).\nComplex and imaginary numbers have grown organically within\nmathematics, and they have proved their mettle in scientific\napplications, but pseudo-irrationals are inorganic creations\ninvented solely for the sake of mistaken foundationalist aims.\nWittgenstein’s main point is not that we cannot create\nfurther recursive real numbers—indeed, we can create as many as\nwe want—his point is that we can only really speak of different\nsystems (sets) of real numbers (RFM II, §33)\nthat are enumerable by a rule, and any attempt to speak of “the\nset of all real numbers” or any piecemeal attempt to add or\nconsider new recursive reals (e.g., diagonal numbers) is a useless\nand/or futile endeavour based on foundational misconceptions. Indeed,\nin 1930 manuscript and typescript (hereafter MS and TS, respectively)\npassages on irrationals and Cantor’s diagonal, which were not\nincluded in PR or PG, Wittgenstein says: “The\nconcept ‘irrational number’ is a dangerous\npseudo-concept” (MS 108, 176; 1930; TS 210, 29; 1930).  As we\nshall see in the next section, on Wittgenstein’s account, if we\ndo not understand irrationals rightly, we cannot but engender\nthe mistakes that constitute set theory. \nWittgenstein’s critique of set theory begins somewhat benignly\nin the Tractatus, where he denounces Logicism and says\n(6.031) that “[t]he theory of classes is completely superfluous\nin mathematics” because, at least in part, “the generality\nrequired in mathematics is not accidental generality”. In his\nmiddle period, Wittgenstein begins a full-out assault on set theory\nthat never abates. Set theory, he says, is “utter\nnonsense” (PR §§145, 174; WVC 102;\nPG 464, 470), ‘wrong’ (PR §174),\nand ‘laughable’ (PG 464); its “pernicious\nidioms” (PR §173) mislead us and the crudest\npossible misinterpretation is the very impetus of its invention\n(Hintikka 1993: 24, 27). \nWittgenstein’s intermediate critique of transfinite set theory\n(hereafter “set theory”) has two main components: (1) his\ndiscussion of the intension-extension distinction, and (2) his\ncriticism of non-denumerability as cardinality. Late in the\nmiddle period, Wittgenstein seems to become more aware of the\nunbearable conflict between his strong formalism (PG\n334) and his denigration of set theory as a purely formal,\nnon-mathematical calculus (Rodych 1997: 217–219),\nwhich, as we shall see in\n Section 3.5,\n leads to the use of an extra-mathematical application criterion to\ndemarcate transfinite set theory (and other purely formal sign-games)\nfrom mathematical calculi. \nThe search for a comprehensive theory of the real numbers and\nmathematical continuity has led to a “fictitious\nsymbolism” (PR §174). \nSet theory attempts to grasp the infinite at a more general level than\nthe investigation of the laws of the real numbers. It says that you\ncan’t grasp the actual infinite by means of mathematical\nsymbolism at all and therefore it can only be described and not\nrepresented. … One might say of this theory that it buys a pig\nin a poke. Let the infinite accommodate itself in this box as best it\ncan. (PG 468; cf. PR §170) \nAs Wittgenstein puts it at (PG 461),  \nthe mistake in the set-theoretical approach consists time and again in\ntreating laws and enumerations (lists) as essentially the same kind of\nthing and arranging them in parallel series so that one fills in gaps\nleft by the other.  \nThis is a mistake because it is ‘nonsense’ to say\n“we cannot enumerate all the numbers of a set, but we can give a\ndescription”, for “[t]he one is not a substitute for the\nother” (WVC 102; June 19, 1930); “there\nisn’t a dualism [of] the law and the infinite series obeying\nit” (PR §180). \n“Set theory is wrong” and nonsensical (PR\n§174), says Wittgenstein, because it presupposes a fictitious\nsymbolism of infinite signs (PG 469) instead of an actual\nsymbolism with finite signs. The grand intimation of set theory, which\nbegins with “Dirichlet’s concept of a function”\n(WVC 102–03), is that we can in principle\nrepresent an infinite set by an enumeration, but because of human or\nphysical limitations, we will instead describe it\nintensionally. But, says Wittgenstein, “[t]here can’t be\npossibility and actuality in mathematics”, for mathematics is an\nactual calculus, which “is concerned only with the\nsigns with which it actually operates” (PG\n469). As Wittgenstein puts it at (PR §159), the fact\nthat “we can’t describe mathematics, we can only do\nit” in and “of itself abolishes every ‘set\ntheory’”. \nPerhaps the best example of this phenomenon is Dedekind, who in giving\nhis ‘definition’ of an “infinite class” as\n“a class which is similar to a proper subclass of itself”\n(PG 464), “tried to describe an infinite\nclass” (PG 463). If, however, we try to apply this\n‘definition’ to a particular class in order to ascertain\nwhether it is finite or infinite, the attempt is\n‘laughable’ if we apply it to a finite class,\nsuch as “a certain row of trees”, and it is\n‘nonsense’ if we apply it to “an infinite\nclass”, for we cannot even attempt “to co-ordinate\nit” (PG 464), because “the relation \\(m = 2n\\)\n[does not] correlate the class of all numbers with one of its\nsubclasses” (PR §141), it is an “infinite\nprocess” which “correlates any arbitrary number with\nanother”. So, although we can use \\(m = 2n\\) on the\nrule for generating the naturals (i.e., our domain) and\nthereby construct the pairs (2,1), (4,2), (6,3), (8,4), etc., in doing\nso we do not correlate two infinite sets or extensions\n(WVC 103). If we try to apply Dedekind’s definition as\na criterion for determining whether a given set is infinite\nby establishing a 1–1 correspondence between two inductive rules\nfor generating “infinite extensions”, one of which is an\n“extensional subset” of the other, we can’t possibly\nlearn anything we didn’t already know when we applied the\n‘criterion’ to two inductive rules. If Dedekind or anyone\nelse insists on calling an inductive rule an “infinite\nset”, he and we must still mark the categorical difference\nbetween such a set and a finite set with a determinate, finite\ncardinality. \nIndeed, on Wittgenstein’s account, the failure to properly\ndistinguish mathematical extensions and intensions is the root cause\nof the mistaken interpretation of Cantor’s diagonal proof as a\nproof of the existence of infinite sets of lesser and greater\ncardinality. \nWittgenstein’s criticism of non-denumerability is primarily\nimplicit during the middle period. Only after 1937 does he provide\nconcrete arguments purporting to show, e.g., that Cantor’s\ndiagonal cannot prove that some infinite sets have greater\n‘multiplicity’ than others. \nNonetheless, the intermediate Wittgenstein clearly rejects the notion\nthat a non-denumerably infinite set is greater in cardinality than a\ndenumerably infinite set. \nWhen people say ‘The set of all transcendental numbers is\ngreater than that of algebraic numbers’, that’s nonsense.\nThe set is of a different kind. It isn’t ‘no longer’\ndenumerable, it’s simply not denumerable! (PR\n§174) \nAs with his intermediate views on genuine irrationals and the\nMultiplicative Axiom, Wittgenstein here looks at the diagonal proof of\nthe non-denumerability of “the set of transcendental\nnumbers” as one that shows only that transcendental numbers\ncannot be recursively enumerated. It is nonsense, he says, to go from\nthe warranted conclusion that these numbers are not, in principle,\nenumerable to the conclusion that the set of transcendental\nnumbers is greater in cardinality than the set of algebraic numbers,\nwhich is recursively enumerable. What we have here are two very\ndifferent conceptions of a number-type. In the case of algebraic\nnumbers, we have a decision procedure for determining of any given\nnumber whether or not it is algebraic, and we have a method\nof enumerating the algebraic numbers such that we can see\nthat ‘each’ algebraic number “will be”\nenumerated. In the case of transcendental numbers, on the other hand,\nwe have proofs that some numbers are transcendental (i.e.,\nnon-algebraic), and we have a proof that we cannot\nrecursively enumerate each and every thing we would call a\n“transcendental number”. \nAt (PG 461), Wittgenstein similarly speaks of set\ntheory’s “mathematical pseudo-concepts” leading to a\nfundamental difficulty, which begins when we unconsciously presuppose\nthat there is sense to the idea of ordering the rationals by\nsize—“that the attempt is\nthinkable”—and culminates in similarly thinking that it is\npossible to enumerate the real numbers, which we then\ndiscover is impossible. \nThough the intermediate Wittgenstein certainly seems highly critical\nof the alleged proof that some infinite sets (e.g., the reals) are\ngreater in cardinality than other infinite sets, and though he\ndiscusses the “diagonal procedure” in February 1929 and in\nJune 1930 (MS 106, 266; MS 108, 180), along with a diagonal diagram,\nthese and other early-middle ruminations did not make it into the\ntypescripts for either PR or PG. As we shall see in\n Section 3.4,\n the later Wittgenstein analyzes Cantor’s diagonal and claims of\nnon-denumerability in some detail. \nThe first and most important thing to note about Wittgenstein’s\nlater Philosophy of Mathematics is that RFM, first published\nin 1956, consists of selections taken from a number of\nmanuscripts (1937–1944), most of one large typescript (1938),\nand three short typescripts (1938), each of which constitutes an\nAppendix to (RFM I). For this reason and because some\nmanuscripts containing much material on mathematics (e.g., MS 123)\nwere not used at all for\nRFM, philosophers have not been able to read\nWittgenstein’s later remarks on mathematics as they were written\nin the manscripts used for RFM and they have not had access\n(until the 2000–2001 release of the Nachlass on CD-ROM)\nto much of Wittgenstein’s later work on mathematics. It must be\nemphasized, therefore, that this Encyclopedia article is\nbeing written during a transitional period. Until philosophers have\nused the Nachlass to build a comprehensive picture of\nWittgenstein’s complete and evolving Philosophy of Mathematics,\nwe will not be able to say definitively which views the later\nWittgenstein retained, which he changed, and which he dropped. In the\ninterim, this article will outline Wittgenstein’s later\nPhilosophy of Mathematics, drawing primarily on RFM, to a\nmuch lesser extent LFM (1939 Cambridge lectures), and, where\npossible, previously unpublished material in Wittgenstein’s\nNachlass. \nIt should also be noted at the outset that commentators disagree about\nthe continuity of Wittgenstein’s middle and later Philosophies\nof Mathematics. Some argue that the later views are significantly\ndifferent from the intermediate views (Frascolla 1994; Gerrard 1991:\n127, 131–32; Floyd 2005: 105–106), while others argue\nthat, for the most part, Wittgenstein’s Philosophy of\nMathematics evolves from the middle to the later period without\nsignificant changes or renunciations (Wrigley 1993; Marion 1998). The remainder of this article adopts the\nsecond interpretation, explicating Wittgenstein’s later\nPhilosophy of Mathematics as largely continuous with his intermediate\nviews, except for the important introduction of an extra-mathematical\napplication criterion. \nPerhaps the most important constant in Wittgenstein’s Philosophy\nof Mathematics, middle and late, is that he consistently maintains\nthat mathematics is our, human invention, and that, indeed, everything\nin mathematics is invented. Just as the middle Wittgenstein says that\n“[w]e make mathematics”, the later Wittgenstein\nsays that we ‘invent’ mathematics (RFM I,\n§168; II, §38; V, §§5, 9 and 11; PG\n469–70) and that “the mathematician is not a discoverer:\nhe is an inventor” (RFM, Appendix II, §2;\n(LFM 22, 82). Nothing exists mathematically unless\nand until we have invented it. \nIn arguing against mathematical discovery, Wittgenstein is not just\nrejecting Platonism, he is also rejecting a rather standard\nphilosophical view according to which human beings invent mathematical\ncalculi, but once a calculus has been invented, we thereafter discover\nfinitely many of its infinitely many provable and true theorems. As\nWittgenstein himself asks (RFM IV, §48), “might it\nnot be said that the rules lead this way, even if no one went\nit?” If “someone produced a proof [of\n‘Goldbach’s theorem’]”,\n“[c]ouldn’t one say”, Wittgenstein asks\n(LFM 144), “that the possibility of this proof\nwas a fact in the realms of mathematical reality”—that\n“[i]n order [to] find it, it must in some sense be\nthere”—“[i]t must be a possible\nstructure”? \nUnlike many or most philosophers of mathematics, Wittgenstein resists\nthe ‘Yes’ answer that we discover truths about a\nmathematical calculus that come into existence the moment we\ninvent the calculus (PR §141; PG 283, 466;\nLFM 139). Wittgenstein rejects the modal reification of\npossibility as actuality—that provability and constructibility\nare (actual) facts—by arguing that it is at the very least\nwrong-headed to say with the Platonist that because “a straight\nline can be drawn between any two points,… the line\nalready exists even if no one has drawn it”—to say\n“[w]hat in the ordinary world we call a possibility is in the\ngeometrical world a reality” (LFM 144; RFM I,\n§21). One might as well say, Wittgenstein suggests (PG\n374), that “chess only had to be discovered, it was\nalways there!” \nAt MS 122 (3v; Oct. 18, 1939), Wittgenstein once again emphasizes the\ndifference between illusory mathematical discovery and genuine\nmathematical invention. \nI want to get away from the formulation: “I now know more about\nthe calculus”, and replace it with “I now have a different\ncalculus”. The sense of this is always to keep before\none’s eyes the full scale of the gulf between a mathematical\nknowing and non-mathematical\n knowing.[3] \nAnd as with the middle period, the later Wittgenstein similarly says\n(MS 121, 27r; May 27, 1938) that “[i]t helps if one says: the\nproof of the Fermat proposition is not to be discovered, but to be\ninvented”. \nThe difference between the ‘anthropological’ and the\nmathematical account is that in the first we are not tempted to speak\nof ‘mathematical facts’, but rather that in this account\nthe facts are never mathematical ones, never make\nmathematical propositions true or false. (MS 117, 263; March\n15, 1940) \nThere are no mathematical facts just as there are no (genuine)\nmathematical propositions. Repeating his intermediate view, the later\nWittgenstein says (MS 121, 71v; 27 Dec., 1938): “Mathematics\nconsists of [calculi | calculations], not of propositions”. This\nradical constructivist conception of mathematics prompts Wittgenstein\nto make notorious remarks—remarks that virtually no one else\nwould make—such as the infamous (RFM V, §9):\n“However queer it sounds, the further expansion of an irrational\nnumber is a further expansion of mathematics”. \nAs in the middle period, the later Wittgenstein maintains that\nmathematics is essentially syntactical and non-referential, which, in\nand of itself, makes Wittgenstein’s philosophy of mathematics\nanti-Platonist insofar as Platonism is the view that mathematical\nterms and propositions refer to objects and/or facts and that\nmathematical propositions are true by virtue of agreeing with\nmathematical facts. \nThe later Wittgenstein, however, wishes to ‘warn’ us that\nour thinking is saturated with the idea of “[a]rithmetic as the\nnatural history (mineralogy) of numbers” (RFM IV,\n§11). When, for instance, Wittgenstein discusses the claim that\nfractions cannot be ordered by magnitude, he says that this sounds\n‘remarkable’ in a way that a mundane proposition of the\ndifferential calculus does not, for the latter proposition is\nassociated with an application in physics,  \nwhereas this proposition … seems to\n[solely] concern… the natural history of\nmathematical objects themselves. (RFM II, §40)  \nWittgenstein stresses that he is trying to ‘warn’ us\nagainst this ‘aspect’—the idea that the foregoing\nproposition about fractions “introduces us to the mysteries of\nthe mathematical world”, which exists somewhere as a completed\ntotality, awaiting our prodding and our discoveries. The fact that we\nregard mathematical propositions as being about mathematical objects\nand mathematical investigation “as the exploration of these\nobjects” is “already mathematical alchemy”, claims\nWittgenstein (RFM V, §16), since  \nit is not possible to appeal to the meaning\n[Bedeutung] of the signs in\nmathematics,… because it is only mathematics that gives them\ntheir meaning [Bedeutung].  \nPlatonism is dangerously misleading, according to\nWittgenstein, because it suggests a picture of pre-existence,\npredetermination and discovery that is completely at odds\nwith what we find if we actually examine and describe mathematics and\nmathematical activity. “I should like to be able to\ndescribe”, says Wittgenstein (RFM IV, §13),\n“how it comes about that mathematics appears to us now as the\nnatural history of the domain of numbers, now again as a collection of\nrules”. \nWittgenstein, however, does not endeavour to refute\nPlatonism. His aim, instead, is to clarify what Platonism is and what\nit says, implicitly and explicitly (including variants of Platonism\nthat claim, e.g., that if a proposition is provable in an\naxiom system, then there already exists a path [i.e., a proof] from\nthe axioms to that proposition (RFM I, §21; Marion 1998:\n13–14, 226; Steiner 2000:\n334). Platonism is either “a mere truism” (LFM\n239), Wittgenstein says, or it is a ‘picture’ consisting\nof “an infinity of shadowy worlds” (LFM 145),\nwhich, as such, lacks ‘utility’ (cf. PI\n§254) because it explains nothing and it misleads at every\nturn. \nThough commentators and critics do not agree as to whether the later\nWittgenstein is still a finitist and whether, if he is, his finitism\nis as radical as his intermediate rejection of unbounded mathematical\nquantification (Maddy 1986: 300–301, 310), the overwhelming\nevidence indicates that the later Wittgenstein still rejects the\nactual infinite (RFM V, §21; Zettel §274,\n1947) and infinite mathematical extensions. \nThe first, and perhaps most definitive, indication that the later\nWittgenstein maintains his finitism is his continued and consistent\ninsistence that irrational numbers are rules for constructing finite\nexpansions, not infinite mathematical extensions. “The\nconcepts of infinite decimals in mathematical propositions are not\nconcepts of series”, says Wittgenstein (RFM V,\n§19), “but of the unlimited technique of expansion of\nseries”. We are misled by “[t]he extensional definitions\nof functions, of real numbers etc”. (RFM V, §35),\nbut once we recognize the Dedekind cut as “an extensional\nimage”, we see that we are not “led to\n\\(\\sqrt{2}\\) by way of the concept of a cut” (RFM V,\n§34). On the later Wittgenstein’s account, there simply is\nno property, no rule, no systematic means\nof defining each and every irrational number intensionally,\nwhich means there is no criterion “for the irrational\nnumbers being complete” (PR §181). \nAs in his intermediate position, the later Wittgenstein claims that\n‘\\(\\aleph_0\\)’ and “infinite series” get their\nmathematical uses from the use of ‘infinity’ in ordinary\nlanguage (RFM II, §60). Although, in ordinary language,\nwe often use ‘infinite’ and “infinitely many”\nas answers to the question “how many?”, and though we\nassociate infinity with the enormously large, the principal\nuse we make of ‘infinite’ and\n‘infinity’ is to speak of the unlimited\n(RFM V, §14) and unlimited techniques\n(RFM II, §45; PI §218). This fact is\nbrought out by the fact “that the technique of learning\n\\(\\aleph_0\\) numerals is different from the technique of learning\n100,000 numerals” (LFM 31). When we say, e.g., that\n“there are an infinite number of even numbers” we mean\nthat we have a mathematical technique or rule for generating even\nnumbers which is limitless, which is markedly different from\na limited technique or rule for generating a finite number of numbers,\nsuch as 1–100,000,000. “We learn an endless\ntechnique”, says Wittgenstein (RFM V, §19),\n“but what is in question here is not some gigantic\nextension”. \nAn infinite sequence, for example, is not a gigantic extension because\nit is not an extension, and ‘\\(\\aleph_0\\)’ is not a\ncardinal number, for “how is this picture connected with the\ncalculus”, given that “its connexion is not that\nof the picture | | | | with 4” (i.e., given that\n‘\\(\\aleph_0\\)’ is not connected to a (finite) extension)?\nThis shows, says Wittgenstein (RFM II, §58), that we\nought to avoid the word ‘infinite’ in mathematics wherever\nit seems to give a meaning to the calculus, rather than acquiring its\nmeaning from the calculus and its use in the calculus. Once we see\nthat the calculus contains nothing infinite, we should not be\n‘disappointed’ (RFM II, §60), but simply\nnote (RFM II, §59) that it is not “really\nnecessary… to conjure up the picture of the infinite (of the\nenormously big)”. \nA second strong indication that the later Wittgenstein maintains his\nfinitism is his continued and consistent treatment of\n‘propositions’ of the type “There are three\nconsecutive 7s in the decimal expansion of \\(\\pi\\)” (hereafter\n ‘PIC’).[4]\n In the middle period, PIC (and its putative negation, \\(\\neg\\)PIC,\nnamely, “It is not the case that there are three consecutive 7s\nin the decimal expansion of \\(\\pi\\)”) is not a\nmeaningful mathematical “statement at all” (WVC\n81–82: note 1). On Wittgenstein’s intermediate view,\nPIC—like FLT, GC, and the Fundamental Theorem of\nAlgebra—is not a mathematical proposition because we do\nnot have in hand an applicable decision procedure by which we can\ndecide it in a particular calculus. For this reason, we can only\nmeaningfully state finitistic propositions regarding the\nexpansion of \\(\\pi\\), such as “There exist three consecutive 7s\nin the first 10,000 places of the expansion of \\(\\pi\\)”\n(WVC 71; 81–82, note 1). \nThe later Wittgenstein maintains this position in various passages in\nRFM (Bernays 1959: 11–12). For example, to someone who says that since “the\nrule of expansion determine[\\(s\\)] the series\ncompletely”, “it must implicitly determine all\nquestions about the structure of the series”, Wittgenstein\nreplies: “Here you are thinking of finite series”\n(RFM V, §11). If PIC were a mathematical\nquestion (or problem)—if it were finitistically\nrestricted—it would be algorithmically decidable, which it is\nnot (RFM V, §21; LFM 31–32, 111, 170;\nWVC 102–03). As Wittgenstein says at (RFM V,\n§9): “The question… changes its status, when it\nbecomes decidable”, “[f]or a connexion is made then, which\nformerly was not there”. And if, moreover, one invokes\nthe Law of the Excluded Middle to establish that PIC is a mathematical\nproposition—i.e., by saying that one of these “two\npictures… must correspond to the fact” (RFM V,\n§10)—one simply begs the question (RFM V,\n§12), for if we have doubts about the mathematical status of PIC,\nwe will not be swayed by a person who asserts “PIC \\(\\vee\n\\neg\\)PIC” (RFM VII, §41; V, §13). \nWittgenstein’s finitism, constructivism, and conception of\nmathematical decidability are interestingly connected at (RFM\nVII, §41, par. 2–5). \nWhat harm is done e.g. by saying that God knows all\nirrational numbers? Or: that they are already there, even though we\nonly know certain of them? Why are these pictures not harmless? \nFor one thing, they hide certain problems.— (MS 124: 139; March\n16, 1944) \nSuppose that people go on and on calculating the expansion of \\(\\pi\\).\nSo God, who knows everything, knows whether they will have reached\n‘777’ by the end of the world. But can his\nomniscience decide whether they would have reached\nit after the end of the world? It cannot. I want to say: Even God can\ndetermine something mathematical only by mathematics. Even for him the\nmere rule of expansion cannot decide anything that it does not decide\nfor us. \nWe might put it like this: if the rule for the expansion has been\ngiven us, a calculation can tell us that there is a\n‘2’ at the fifth place. Could God have known this, without\nthe calculation, purely from the rule of expansion? I want to say: No.\n(MS 124, pp. 175–176; March 23–24, 1944) \nWhat Wittgenstein means here is that God’s omniscience\nmight, by calculation, find that ‘777’ occurs at\nthe interval [\\(n,n+2\\)], but, on the other hand, God might go on\ncalculating forever without ‘777’ ever turning up. Since\n\\(\\pi\\) is not a completed infinite extension that can be\ncompletely surveyed by an omniscient being (i.e., it is not a fact\nthat can be known by an omniscient mind), even God has only the rule,\nand so God’s omniscience is no advantage in this case\n(LFM 103–04; cf. Weyl 1921 [1998: 97]). Like us, with\nour modest minds, an omniscient mind (i.e., God) can only calculate\nthe expansion of \\(\\pi\\) to some \\(n\\)th decimal\nplace—where our \\(n\\) is minute and God’s \\(n\\) is\n(relatively) enormous—and at no \\(n\\)th decimal place\ncould any mind rightly conclude that because\n‘777’ has not turned up, it, therefore, will never turn\nup. \nOn one fairly standard interpretation, the later Wittgenstein says\nthat “true in calculus \\(\\Gamma\\)” is identical to\n“provable in calculus \\(\\Gamma\\)” and, therefore, that a\nmathematical proposition of calculus \\(\\Gamma\\) is a concatenation of\nsigns that is either provable (in principle) or refutable (in\nprinciple) in calculus \\(\\Gamma\\) (Goodstein 1972: 279, 282; Anderson\n1958: 487; Klenk 1976: 13; Frascolla 1994: 59). On this\ninterpretation, the later Wittgenstein precludes undecidable\nmathematical propositions, but he allows that some undecided\nexpressions are propositions of a calculus because they are\ndecidable in principle (i.e., in the absence of a known, applicable\ndecision procedure). \nThere is considerable evidence, however, that the later Wittgenstein\nmaintains his intermediate position that an expression is a meaningful\nmathematical proposition only within a given calculus and\niff we knowingly have in hand an applicable and effective\ndecision procedure by means of which we can decide it. For example,\nthough Wittgenstein vacillates between “provable in PM”\nand “proved in PM” at (RFM App. III, §6,\n§8), he does so in order to use the former to consider the\nalleged conclusion of Gödel’s proof (i.e., that there exist\ntrue but unprovable mathematical propositions), which he then rebuts\nwith his own identification of “true in calculus\n\\(\\Gamma\\)” with “proved in calculus\n\\(\\Gamma\\)” (i.e., not with “provable in\ncalculus \\(\\Gamma\\)”) (Wang 1991: 253; Rodych 1999a: 177). This\nconstrual is corroborated by numerous passages in which Wittgenstein\nrejects the received view that a provable but unproved\nproposition is true, as he does when he asserts that (RFM\nIII, §31, 1939) a proof “makes new connexions”,\n“[i]t does not establish that they are there” because\n“they do not exist until it makes them”, and when he says\n(RFM VII, §10, 1941) that “[a] new proof gives the\nproposition a place in a new system”. Furthermore, as we have\njust seen, Wittgenstein rejects PIC as a non-proposition on the\ngrounds that it is not algorithmically decidable, while admitting\nfinitistic versions of PIC because they are algorithmically\ndecidable. \nPerhaps the most compelling evidence that the later Wittgenstein\nmaintains algorithmic decidability as his criterion for a mathematical\nproposition lies in the fact that, at (RFM V, §9, 1942),\nhe says in two distinct ways that a mathematical\n‘question’ can become decidable and that when\nthis happens, a new connexion is ‘made’\nwhich previously did not exist. Indeed, Wittgenstein cautions us\nagainst appearances by saying that “it looks as if a\nground for the decision were already there”, when, in fact,\n“it has yet to be invented”. These passages strongly\nmilitate against the claim that the later Wittgenstein grants that\nproposition \\(\\phi\\) is decidable in calculus \\(\\Gamma\\) iff it is\nprovable or refutable in principle. Moreover, if Wittgenstein\nheld this position, he would claim, contra (RFM V,\n§9), that a question or proposition does not become\ndecidable since it simply (always) is decidable. If it is\nprovable, and we simply don’t yet know this to be the case,\nthere already is a connection between, say, our axioms and\nrules and the proposition in question. What Wittgenstein says,\nhowever, is that the modalities provable and\nrefutable are shadowy forms of reality—that possibility\nis not actuality in mathematics (PR §§141, 144,\n172; PG 281, 283, 299, 371, 466, 469; LFM 139).\nThus, the later Wittgenstein agrees with the intermediate Wittgenstein\nthat the only sense in which an undecided mathematical\nproposition (RFM VII, §40, 1944) can be\ndecidable is in the sense that we know how to decide\nit by means of an applicable decision procedure. \nLargely a product of his anti-foundationalism and his\ncriticism of the extension-intension conflation, Wittgenstein’s\nlater critique of set theory is highly consonant with his intermediate\ncritique (PR §§109, 168; PG 334, 369, 469;\nLFM 172, 224, 229; and RFM III, §43, 46, 85,\n90; VII, §16). Given that mathematics is a “MOTLEY of\ntechniques of proof” (RFM III, §46), it does not\nrequire a foundation (RFM VII, §16) and it cannot be\ngiven a self-evident foundation (PR §160;\nWVC 34 & 62; RFM IV, §3). Since set theory\nwas invented to provide mathematics with a foundation, it is,\nminimally, unnecessary. \nEven if set theory is unnecessary, it still might constitute a solid\nfoundation for mathematics. In his core criticism of set theory,\nhowever, the later Wittgenstein denies this, saying that the diagonal\nproof does not prove non-denumerability, for “[i]t means nothing\nto say: ‘Therefore the X numbers are not\ndenumerable’” (RFM II, §10). When the diagonal is\nconstrued as a proof of greater and lesser infinite sets it\nis a “puffed-up proof”, which, as Poincaré argued\n(1913: 61–62), purports to prove or show more than “its\nmeans allow it” (RFM II, §21). \nIf it were said: Consideration of the diagonal procedure shews you that the\nconcept ‘real number’ has much less analogy with\nthe concept ‘cardinal number’ than we, being misled by\ncertain analogies, are inclined to believe, that would have a good and honest sense. But just the\nopposite happens: one pretends to compare the\n‘set’ of real numbers in magnitude with that of cardinal\nnumbers. The difference in kind between the two conceptions is\nrepresented, by a skew form of expression, as difference of extension.\nI believe, and hope, that a future generation will laugh at this hocus\npocus. (RFM II, §22) \nThe sickness of a time is cured by an alteration in the mode of life\nof human beings… (RFM II, §23) \nThe “hocus pocus” of the diagonal proof rests, as always\nfor Wittgenstein, on a conflation of extension and intension, on the\nfailure to properly distinguish sets as rules for generating\nextensions and (finite) extensions. By way of this confusion “a\ndifference in kind” (i.e., unlimited rule vs. finite extension)\n“is represented by a skew form of expression”, namely as a\ndifference in the cardinality of two infinite\nextensions. Not only can the diagonal not prove that one\ninfinite set is greater in cardinality than another infinite set,\naccording to Wittgenstein, nothing could prove this, simply\nbecause “infinite sets” are not extensions, and\nhence not infinite extensions. But instead of interpreting\nCantor’s diagonal proof honestly, we take the proof to\n“show there are numbers bigger than the infinite”, which\n“sets the whole mind in a whirl, and gives the pleasant feeling\nof paradox” (LFM 16–17)—a “giddiness\nattacks us when we think of certain theorems in set\ntheory”—“when we are performing a piece of logical\nsleight-of-hand” (PI §412; §426; 1945). This\ngiddiness and pleasant feeling of paradox, says Wittgenstein\n(LFM 16), “may be the chief reason [set theory] was\ninvented”. \nThough Cantor’s diagonal is not a proof of\nnon-denumerability, when it is expressed in a constructive\nmanner, as Wittgenstein himself expresses it at (RFM II,\n§1), “it gives sense to the mathematical proposition that\nthe number so-and-so is different from all those of the system”\n(RFM II, §29). That is, the proof proves\nnon-enumerability: it proves that for any given\ndefinite real number concept (e.g., recursive real), one\ncannot enumerate ‘all’ such numbers because one can always\nconstruct a diagonal number, which falls under the same concept and is\nnot in the enumeration. “One might say”, Wittgenstein\nsays,  \nI call number-concept X non-denumerable if it has been stipulated\nthat, whatever numbers falling under this concept you arrange in a\nseries, the diagonal number of this series is also to fall under that\nconcept. (RFM II, §10; cf. II, §§30, 31,\n13) \nOne lesson to be learned from this, according to Wittgenstein\n(RFM II, §33), is that “there are diverse\nsystems of irrational points to be found in the number\nline”, each of which can be given by a recursive rule, but\n“no system of irrational numbers”, and “also no\nsuper-system, no ‘set of irrational numbers’ of\nhigher-order infinity”. Cantor has shown that we can construct\n“infinitely many” diverse systems of irrational numbers,\nbut we cannot construct an exhaustive system of all\nthe irrational numbers (RFM II, §29). As Wittgenstein\nsays at (MS 121, 71r; Dec. 27, 1938), three pages after the passage\nused for (RFM II, §57):  \nIf you now call the Cantorian procedure one for producing a new real\nnumber, you will now no longer be inclined to speak of a system of\nall real numbers. (italics added)  \nFrom Cantor’s proof, however, set theorists erroneously conclude\nthat “the set of irrational numbers” is greater in\nmultiplicity than any enumeration of irrationals (or the set of\nrationals), when the only conclusion to draw is that there is no such\nthing as the set of all the irrational numbers. The\ntruly dangerous aspect to ‘propositions’ such as\n“The real numbers cannot be arranged in a series” and\n“The set… is not denumerable” is that they make\nconcept formation [i.e., our invention] “look like a\nfact of nature” (i.e., something we discover)\n(RFM II §§16, 37). At best, we have a vague idea of\nthe concept of “real number”, but only if we restrict this\nidea to “recursive real number” and only if we recognize\nthat having the concept does not mean having a set\nof all recursive real numbers. \nThe principal and most significant change from the middle to later\nwritings on mathematics is Wittgenstein’s (re-)introduction of\nan extra-mathematical application criterion, which is used to\ndistinguish mere “sign-games” from mathematical\nlanguage-games. “[I]t is essential to mathematics that its signs\nare also employed in mufti”, Wittgenstein states, for\n \n[i]t is the use outside mathematics, and so the meaning\n[Bedeutung] of the signs, that makes the\nsign-game into mathematics. (i.e., a mathematical\n“language-game”; RFM V, §2, 1942;\nLFM 140–141, 169–70)  \nAs Wittgenstein says at (RFM V, §41, 1943),  \n[c]oncepts which occur in ‘necessary’ propositions\nmust also occur and have a meaning\n[Bedeutung] in non-necessary ones. (italics\nadded)  \nIf two proofs prove the same proposition, says Wittgenstein, this\nmeans that “both demonstrate it as a suitable instrument for the\nsame purpose”, which “is an allusion to something\noutside mathematics” (RFM VII, §10, 1941;\nitalics added). \nAs we have seen, this criterion was present in the Tractatus\n(6.211), but noticeably absent in the middle period. The reason for\nthis absence is probably that the intermediate Wittgenstein wanted to\nstress that in mathematics everything is syntax and nothing is\nmeaning. Hence, in his criticisms of Hilbert’s\n‘contentual’ mathematics (Hilbert 1925) and\nBrouwer’s reliance upon intuition to determine the meaningful\ncontent of (especially undecidable) mathematical propositions,\nWittgenstein couched his finitistic constructivism in strong\nformalism, emphasizing that a mathematical calculus does not need an\nextra-mathematical application (PR §109; WVC\n105). \nThere seem to be two reasons why the later Wittgenstein reintroduces\nextra-mathematical application as a necessary condition of a\nmathematical language-game. First, the later Wittgenstein has\nan even greater interest in the use of natural and formal\nlanguages in diverse “forms of life” (PI\n§23), which prompts him to emphasize that, in many cases, a\nmathematical ‘proposition’ functions as if it were an\nempirical proposition “hardened into a rule” (RFM\nVI, §23) and that mathematics plays diverse applied roles in many\nforms of human activity (e.g., science, technology, predictions).\nSecond, the extra-mathematical application criterion relieves the\ntension between Wittgenstein’s intermediate critique of set\ntheory and his strong formalism according to which “one calculus\nis as good as another” (PG 334). By demarcating\nmathematical language-games from non-mathematical sign-games,\nWittgenstein can now claim that, “for the time being”, set\ntheory is merely a formal sign-game.  \nThese considerations may lead us to say that \\(2^{\\aleph_0} \\gt\n\\aleph_0\\). \nThat is to say: we can make the considerations lead us to\nthat. \nOr: we can say this and give this as our reason. \nBut if we do say it—what are we to do next? In what practice is\nthis proposition anchored? It is for the time being a piece of\nmathematical architecture which hangs in the air, and looks as if it\nwere, let us say, an architrave, but not supported by anything and\nsupporting nothing. (RFM II, §35) \nIt is not that Wittgenstein’s later criticisms of set theory\nchange, it is, rather, that once we see that set theory has no\nextra-mathematical application, we will focus on its calculations,\nproofs, and prose and “subject the interest of the\ncalculations to a test” (RFM II, §62). By\nmeans of Wittgenstein’s “immensely\nimportant” ‘investigation’ (LFM 103), we\nwill find, Wittgenstein expects, that set theory is uninteresting\n(e.g., that the non-enumerability of “the reals” is\nuninteresting and useless) and that our entire interest in it lies in\nthe ‘charm’ of the mistaken prose interpretation of its\nproofs (LFM 16). More importantly, though there is “a\nsolid core to all [its] glistening concept-formations”\n(RFM V, §16), once we see it as “as a mistake of\nideas”, we will see that propositions such as\n“\\(2^{\\aleph_0} \\gt \\aleph_0\\)” are not anchored in an\nextra-mathematical practice, that “Cantor’s\nparadise” “is not a paradise”, and we will\nthen leave “of [our] own accord” (LFM\n103). \nIt must be emphasized, however, that the later Wittgenstein still\nmaintains that the operations within a mathematical calculus are\npurely formal, syntactical operations governed by rules of syntax\n(i.e., the solid core of formalism). \nIt is of course clear that the mathematician, in so far as he really\nis ‘playing a game’…[is] acting in\naccordance with certain rules. (RFM V, §1) \nTo say mathematics is a game is supposed to mean: in proving, we need\nnever appeal to the meaning [Bedeutung] of the\nsigns, that is to their extra-mathematical application. (RFM\nV, §4) \nWhere, during the middle period, Wittgenstein speaks of\n“arithmetic [as] a kind of geometry” at (PR\n§109 & §111), the later Wittgenstein similarly speaks of\n“the geometry of proofs” (RFM I, App. III,\n§14), the “geometrical cogency” of proofs\n(RFM III, §43), and a “geometrical\napplication” according to which the “transformation of\nsigns” in accordance with “transformation-rules”\n(RFM VI, §2, 1941) shows that “when mathematics is\ndivested of all content, it would remain that certain signs can be\nconstructed from others according to certain rules”\n(RFM III, §38). Hence, the question whether a\nconcatenation of signs is a proposition of a given\nmathematical calculus (i.e., a calculus with an\nextra-mathematical application) is still an internal, syntactical\nquestion, which we can answer with knowledge of the proofs and\ndecision procedures of the calculus. \nRFM is perhaps most (in)famous for Wittgenstein’s\n(RFM App. III) treatment of “true but unprovable”\nmathematical propositions. Early reviewers said that “[t]he\narguments are wild” (Kreisel 1958: 153), that the passages\n“on Gödel’s theorem… are of poor quality or\ncontain definite errors” (Dummett 1959: 324), and that\n(RFM App. III) “throws no light on Gödel’s\nwork” (Goodstein 1957: 551). “Wittgenstein seems to want\nto legislate [[q]uestions about completeness] out of\nexistence”, Anderson said, (1958: 486–87) when, in fact,\nhe certainly cannot dispose of Gödel’s demonstrations\n“by confusing truth with provability”. Additionally,\nBernays, Anderson (1958: 486), and Kreisel (1958: 153–54)\nclaimed that Wittgenstein failed to appreciate\n“Gödel’s quite explicit premiss of the consistency of\nthe considered formal system” (Bernays 1959: 15), thereby\nfailing to appreciate the conditional nature of Gödel’s\nFirst Incompleteness Theorem. On the reading of these four early\nexpert reviewers, Wittgenstein failed to understand Gödel’s\nTheorem because he failed to understand the mechanics of\nGödel’s proof and he erroneously thought he could refute or\nundermine Gödel’s proof simply by identifying “true\nin PM” (i.e., Principia Mathematica) with\n“proved/provable in PM”. \nInterestingly, we now have two pieces of evidence (Kreisel 1998: 119;\nRodych 2003: 282, 307) that Wittgenstein wrote (RFM App. III)\nin 1937–38 after reading only the informal,\n‘casual’ (MS 126, 126–127; Dec. 13, 1942)\nintroduction of (Gödel 1931) and that, therefore, his use of a\nself-referential proposition as the “true but unprovable\nproposition” may be based on Gödel’s introductory,\ninformal statements, namely that “the undecidable proposition\n[\\(R(q);q\\)] states… that [\\(R(q);q\\)] is not provable”\n(1931: 598) and that “[\\(R(q);q\\)] says about itself that it is\nnot provable” (1931: 599). Perplexingly, only two of the four\nfamous reviewers even mentioned Wittgenstein’s (RFM\nVII, §§19, 21–22, 1941)) explicit remarks on\n‘Gödel’s’ First Incompleteness Theorem (Bernays\n1959: 2; Anderson 1958: 487), which, though flawed, capture the\nnumber-theoretic nature of the Gödelian proposition and\nthe functioning of Gödel-numbering, probably because Wittgenstein\nhad by then read or skimmed the body of Gödel’s 1931 paper. \nThe first thing to note, therefore, about (RFM App. III) is\nthat Wittgenstein mistakenly thinks—again, perhaps because\nWittgenstein had read only Gödel’s Introduction—(a)\nthat Gödel proves that there are true but unprovable propositions\nof PM (when, in fact, Gödel syntactically proves that if\nPM is \\(\\omega\\)-consistent, the Gödelian proposition is\nundecidable in PM) and (b) that Gödel’s proof uses\na self-referential proposition to semantically show that there are\ntrue but unprovable propositions of PM. \nFor this reason, Wittgenstein has two main aims in (RFM App.\nIII): (1) to refute or undermine, on its own terms, the\nalleged Gödel proof of true but unprovable propositions of\nPM, and (2) to show that, on his own terms, where “true\nin calculus \\(\\Gamma\\)” is identified with\n“proved in calculus \\(\\Gamma\\)”, the very idea of\na true but unprovable proposition of calculus \\(\\Gamma\\) is\nmeaningless. \nThus, at (RFM App. III, §8) (hereafter simply\n‘§8’), Wittgenstein begins his presentation of what\nhe takes to be Gödel’s proof by having someone say:  \nI have constructed a proposition (I will use ‘P’ to\ndesignate it) in Russell’s symbolism, and by means of certain\ndefinitions and transformations it can be so interpreted that it says:\n‘P is not provable in Russell’s system’.  \nThat is, Wittgenstein’s Gödelian constructs a proposition\nthat is semantically self-referential and which specifically\nsays of itself that it is not provable in PM. With this\nerroneous, self-referential proposition P [used also at\n(§10), (§11), (§17), (§18)], Wittgenstein presents\na proof-sketch very similar to Gödel’s own\ninformal semantic proof ‘sketch’ in the\nIntroduction of his famous paper (1931: 598). \nMust I not say that this proposition on the one hand is true, and on\nthe other hand is unprovable? For suppose it were false; then it is\ntrue that it is provable. And that surely cannot be! And if it is\nproved, then it is proved that it is not provable. Thus it can only be\ntrue, but unprovable. (§8) \nThe reasoning here is a double reductio. Assume (a) that\nP must either be true or false in Russell’s system, and (b)\nthat P must either be provable or unprovable in Russell’s\nsystem. If (a), P must be true, for if we suppose that\nP is false, since P says of itself that it is unprovable,\n“it is true that it is provable”, and if it is provable,\nit must be true (which is a contradiction), and hence, given what\nP means or says, it is true that P is unprovable (which is a\ncontradiction). Second, if (b), P must be unprovable, for if P\n“is proved, then it is proved that it is not provable”,\nwhich is a contradiction (i.e., P is provable and not\nprovable in PM). It follows that P “can only be\ntrue, but unprovable”. \nTo refute or undermine this ‘proof’, Wittgenstein says\nthat if you have proved \\(\\neg P\\), you have proved that P is\nprovable (i.e., since you have proved that it is not the case\nthat P is not provable in Russell’s system), and “you\nwill now presumably give up the interpretation that it is\nunprovable” (i.e., ‘P is not provable in\nRussell’s system’), since the contradiction is only proved\nif we use or retain this self-referential interpretation (§8). On\nthe other hand, Wittgenstein argues (§8), ‘[i]f you assume\nthat the proposition is provable in Russell’s system, that means\nit is true in the Russell sense, and the interpretation\n“P is not provable” again has to be given up’,\nbecause, once again, it is only the self-referential interpretation\nthat engenders a contradiction. Thus, Wittgenstein’s\n‘refutation’ of “Gödel’s proof”\nconsists in showing that no contradiction arises if we do not\ninterpret ‘P’ as ‘P is not provable in\nRussell’s system’—indeed, without this\ninterpretation, a proof of P does not yield a proof of \\(\\neg P\\)\nand a proof of \\(\\neg P\\) does not yield a proof of P. In other\nwords, the mistake in the proof is the mistaken assumption that a\nmathematical proposition ‘P’ “can be so\ninterpreted that it says: ‘P is not provable in\nRussell’s system’”. As Wittgenstein says at\n(§11), “[t]hat is what comes of making up such\nsentences”. \nThis ‘refutation’ of “Gödel’s\nproof” is perfectly consistent with Wittgenstein’s\nsyntactical conception of mathematics (i.e., wherein mathematical\npropositions have no meaning and hence cannot have the\n‘requisite’ self-referential meaning) and with what he\nsays before and after (§8), where his main aim is to show (2)\nthat, on his own terms, since “true in calculus\n\\(\\Gamma\\)” is identical with “proved in calculus\n\\(\\Gamma\\)”, the very idea of a true but unprovable proposition\nof calculus \\(\\Gamma\\) is a contradiction-in-terms. \nTo show (2), Wittgenstein begins by asking (§5), what he takes to\nbe, the central question, namely, “Are there true propositions\nin Russell’s system, which cannot be proved in his\nsystem?”. To address this question, he asks “What is\ncalled a true proposition in Russell’s system…?”,\nwhich he succinctly answers (§6): “‘p’\nis true = p”. Wittgenstein then clarifies this answer\nby reformulating the second question of (§5) as “Under what\ncircumstances is a proposition asserted in Russell’s game [i.e.,\nsystem]?”, which he then answers by saying: “the answer\nis: at the end of one of his proofs, or as a ‘fundamental\nlaw’ (Pp.)” (§6). This, in a nutshell, is\nWittgenstein’s conception of “mathematical truth”: a\ntrue proposition of PM is an axiom or a proved proposition,\nwhich means that “true in PM” is identical with,\nand therefore can be supplanted by, “proved in\nPM”. \nHaving explicated, to his satisfaction at least, the only real,\nnon-illusory notion of “true in PM”, Wittgenstein\nanswers the (§8) question “Must I not say that this\nproposition… is true, and… unprovable?”\nnegatively by (re)stating his own (§§5–6)\nconception of “true in PM” as\n“proved/provable in PM”:  \n‘True in Russell’s system’ means, as was said:\nproved in Russell’s system; and ‘false in Russell’s\nsystem’ means: the opposite has been proved in Russell’s\nsystem.  \nThis answer is given in a slightly different way at (§7) where\nWittgenstein asks “may there not be true propositions which are\nwritten in this [Russell’s] symbolism, but are not provable in\nRussell’s system?”, and then answers “‘True\npropositions’, hence propositions which are true in\nanother system, i.e. can rightly be asserted in another\ngame”. In light of what he says in (§§5, 6, and 8),\nWittgenstein’s (§7) point is that if a proposition is\n‘written’ in “Russell’s symbolism” and\nit is true, it must be proved/provable in another system,\nsince that is what “mathematical truth” is. Analogously\n(§8), “if the proposition is supposed to be false in some\nother than the Russell sense, then it does not contradict this for it\nto be proved in Russell’s sense”, for “[w]hat is\ncalled ‘losing’ in chess may constitute winning in another\ngame”. This textual evidence certainly suggests, as Anderson\nalmost said, that Wittgenstein rejects a true but unprovable\nmathematical proposition as a contradiction-in-terms on the grounds\nthat “true in calculus \\(\\Gamma\\)” means nothing more (and\nnothing less) than “proved in calculus \\(\\Gamma\\)”. \nOn this (natural) interpretation of (RFM App. III), the early\nreviewers’ conclusion that Wittgenstein fails to understand the\nmechanics of Gödel’s argument seems reasonable. First,\nWittgenstein erroneously thinks that Gödel’s proof is\nessentially semantical and that it uses and requires a\nself-referential proposition. Second, Wittgenstein says (§14)\nthat “[a] contradiction is unusable” for “a\nprediction” that “that such-and-such construction is\nimpossible” (i.e., that P is unprovable in PM),\nwhich, superficially at least, seems to\nindicate that Wittgenstein fails to appreciate the “consistency\nassumption” of Gödel’s proof (Kreisel, Bernays,\nAnderson). \nIf, in fact, Wittgenstein did not read and/or failed to understand\nGödel’s proof through at least 1941, how would he have\nresponded if and when he understood it as (at least) a proof of the\nundecidability of P in PM on the assumption of\nPM’s consistency? Given his syntactical conception of\nmathematics, even with the extra-mathematical application criterion,\nhe would simply say that P, qua expression syntactically\nindependent of PM, is not a proposition of PM, and\nif it is syntactically independent of all existent mathematical\nlanguage-games, it is not a mathematical proposition. Moreover, there\nseem to be no compelling non-semantical reasons—either\nintra-systemic or extra-mathematical—for Wittgenstein to\naccommodate P by including it in PM or by adopting a\nnon-syntactical conception of mathematical truth (such as Tarski-truth\n(Steiner 2000)). Indeed, Wittgenstein questions the intra-systemic and\nextra-mathematical usability of P in various discussions\nof Gödel in the Nachlass and, at\n(§19), he emphatically says that one cannot “make the truth\nof the assertion [‘P’ or ‘Therefore\nP’] plausible to me, since you can make no use of it except\nto do these bits of legerdemain”. \nAfter the initial, scathing reviews of RFM, very little\nattention was paid to Wittgenstein’s (RFM App. III and\nRFM VII, §§21–22) discussions of\nGödel’s First Incompleteness Theorem (Klenk 1976: 13) until\nShanker’s sympathetic (1988b). In the last 22 years, however,\ncommentators and critics have offered various interpretations of\nWittgenstein’s remarks on Gödel, some being largely\nsympathetic (Floyd 1995, 2001) and others offering a more mixed\nappraisal (Rodych 1999a, 2002, 2003; Steiner 2001; Priest 2004; Berto\n2009a). Recently, and perhaps most interestingly, Floyd & Putnam\n(2000) and Steiner (2001) have evoked new and interesting discussions\nof Wittgenstein’s ruminations on undecidability, mathematical\ntruth, and Gödel’s First Incompleteness Theorem (Rodych\n2003, 2006; Bays 2004; Sayward 2005; and Floyd & Putnam 2006). \nThough it is doubtful that all commentators will agree (Wrigley 1977:\n51; Baker & Hacker 1985: 345; Floyd 1991: 145, 143; 1995: 376;\n2005: 80; Maddy 1993: 55; Steiner 1996: 202–204), the following\npassage seems to capture Wittgenstein’s attitude to the\nPhilosophy of Mathematics and, in large part, the way in which he\nviewed his own work on mathematics. \nWhat will distinguish the mathematicians of the future from those of\ntoday will really be a greater sensitivity, and that\nwill—as it were—prune mathematics; since people will then\nbe more intent on absolute clarity than on the discovery of new\ngames. \nPhilosophical clarity will have the same effect on the growth of\nmathematics as sunlight has on the growth of potato shoots. (In a dark\ncellar they grow yards long.) \nA mathematician is bound to be horrified by my mathematical comments,\nsince he has always been trained to avoid indulging in thoughts and\ndoubts of the kind I develop. He has learned to regard them as\nsomething contemptible and… he has acquired a revulsion from\nthem as infantile. That is to say, I trot out all the problems that a\nchild learning arithmetic, etc., finds difficult, the problems that\neducation represses without solving. I say to those repressed doubts:\nyou are quite correct, go on asking, demand clarification!\n(PG 381, 1932) \nIn his middle and later periods, Wittgenstein believes he is providing\nphilosophical clarity on aspects and parts of mathematics, on\nmathematical conceptions, and on philosophical conceptions of\nmathematics. Lacking such clarity and not aiming for absolute clarity,\nmathematicians construct new games, sometimes because of a\nmisconception of the meaning of their mathematical\npropositions and mathematical terms. Education and especially advanced\neducation in mathematics does not encourage clarity but rather\nrepresses it—questions that deserve answers are either not asked\nor are dismissed. Mathematicians of the future, however, will be more\nsensitive and this will (repeatedly) prune mathematical extensions and\ninventions, since mathematicians will come to recognize that new\nextensions and creations (e.g., propositions of transfinite cardinal\narithmetic) are not well-connected with the solid core of mathematics\nor with real-world applications. Philosophical clarity will,\neventually, enable mathematicians and philosophers to “get down\nto brass tacks” (PG 467).","contact.mail":"rodych@uleth.ca","contact.domain":"uleth.ca"}]
