His greatest work\nis The Nature of Existence, the first volume of which was\npublished in 1921 while the second volume was published posthumously\nin 1927 with C.D. Broad as the editor of the manuscript. In addition,\nhe authored many important articles on metaphysics, including his\nfamous “The Unreality of Time” in 1908, some of which are\ncollected in his Philosophical Studies (1934). \n\n\n\nMcTaggart was also a dedicated interpreter and champion of Hegel, and\nin addition to many articles on the Hegelian philosophy, he published\nthe following books: Studies in the Hegelian Dialectic (1896,\n2nd edition printed in 1922), which contains a painstaking\ndiscussion of the nature of the dialectic as well as the results\nachieved by its means, many of which are conclusions that McTaggart\ncontinued to argue for throughout his career, including among them\nthat time is unreal, that existence exhausts reality, that modal\nnotions cannot be applied to reality as a whole, and that absolute\nreality contains imperfections; Studies in Hegelian Cosmology\n(1901, 2nd edition printed in 1918), in which cosmology is\nunderstood as the discipline that applies a priori conclusions to\nthose entities and features that we are acquainted with via\nexperience, such as selves, the universe, and good and evil, and in\nwhich topics ranging from the ethical status of punishment and the\nnature of sin to whether the absolute is a person, whether human\nbeings are immortal, or whether Hegel is a Christian are discussed in\ngreat detail; and A Commentary on Hegel’s Logic (1910), which\nconsists of a critical commentary on the alleged logical connections\nbetween various categories by which experience must be organized and\nthe various transitions that lead one from Hegel’s category of Being\nto the category of Absolute Idea.\n\n\n\nThe extent to which McTaggart’s interpretations of Hegel are\ncorrect is not a matter on which I am competent to determine. For what\nit is worth, McTaggart’s work on Hegel does not appear to be\nhighly regarded by contemporary scholars of Hegel, insofar as this is\nreflected in the paucity of references to\nMcTaggart’s\n interpretations.[1]\nIn what follows, I will spend little time on those works of McTaggart\nthat occupy themselves with the Hegelian philosophy. This is\nunfortunate, since this might give the impression that grappling with\nHegel’s philosophy was merely a side project for McTaggart rather\nthan a task of much importance for his philosophical development. In\nhis Commentary on Hegel’s Logic, McTaggart tells us that\nthe exposition of Hegel’s philosophy has been the chief object of\nhis life for the last twenty-one\n years (Commentary on Hegel’s Logic, 311).\nMcTaggart’s Hegelianism was also\nimportant for the development of other philosophers such as Bertrand\nRussell, whose early work was inspired by the idealism defended by\nMcTaggart in his Studies of the Hegelian\n Dialectic.[2]\n However, it is\nworth noting that McTaggart himself later abandoned the dialectical\nmethod that he took to be central to Hegel’s own\nmetaphysics.\n\n\n\nThe plan for this article is as follows. Section 1 will provide\nbiographical information about McTaggart. I will then begin to discuss\nthe central themes of McTaggart’s philosophy. Section 2 focuses on\nMcTaggart’s views on the methods of metaphysics. Section 3 discusses\nMcTaggart’s famous argument for the unreality of time.  Section 4 will\nfocus on McTaggart’s philosophy of religion, which was a kind of\natheistic mysticism. Section 5 will focus on\nMcTaggart’s ontological idealism, which is a view akin to the\nidealism of Leibniz and Berkeley. Section 6 will focus on McTaggart’s\nposition on what was perhaps the central metaphysical debate of his\nperiod, namely, the issue of monism vs.\npluralism as well as the concordant issue of the reality of\nrelations. Section 7 will be devoted to a smorgasbord of topics of\ninterest to contemporary metaphysicians, including McTaggart’s\nviews on parts and wholes, the distinction between existence\nand reality, and questions about essentialism.\n\n\n\nSection 8 will be the final part of this article, and will focus on\nMcTaggart’s views on ethics. I will discuss McTaggart’s views on the\nnature of intrinsic value, focusing on the questions of to what\nontological category the bearers of intrinsic value belong and what\nkinds of features determine the intrinsic value of these entities.  I\nwill also discuss McTaggart’s views on love, the emotion that he\naccords the highest place in his ethical system.\n\n\n\nJohn McTaggart Ellis McTaggart was born on the third of September,\n1866, in Norfolk Square in London, to Francis Ellis and Susan\nMcTaggart (Rochelle 1991, 16). He was named at birth “John\nMcTaggart Ellis”, but took on the second iteration of\n“McTaggart” after his great-uncle, also named “John\nMcTaggart”, died without descendents and willed his money to\nFrancis Ellis on the condition that his family assumed the surname\n“McTaggart”. And so John McTaggart Ellis became John\nMcTaggart Ellis McTaggart. (At Cambridge, he was sometimes referred to\nas “McT”.) \nHe began preparatory school at Weybridge, but because of his frequent\nadvocacy of atheism he was removed, and transplanted to Caterham.\nThere he became notorious for refusing to play football, preferring\nrather to lie in the middle of the field (Levy 1981, 101).\nHe began to study Immanuel Kant’s\nCritique of Pure Reason around this\n time (Rochelle 1991, 20).\nHe moved from Caterham to Clifton College as a boarding student in 1882. He\n cherished his memories of Clifton College, despite the perhaps not\n infrequent bullying he encountered\n there.[3] \nHe began his study of philosophy at Trinity College in Cambridge in\n1885 (Rochelle 1991, 42).  In 1886 he joined the influential secret\ndiscussion group, the Cambridge Apostles (Rochelle 1991, 45; Levy\n1981, 103).  At this time, A.N. Whitehead was already a member of the\ngroup, and G.  E. Moore and Bertrand Russell would soon join in the\nearly 1890s.  McTaggart graduated in 1888 (Rochelle 1991, 57).  He was\nelected a Prize Fellow of Trinity College in 1891 on the basis of his\ndissertation on Hegel’s dialectic, which was later recast as\nhis Studies in the Hegelian Dialectic. In 1897 he was made a\nlecturer in Moral Sciences (Philosophy) at Trinity College, and he\nheld this post until he retired in 1923 at the age of 56 (Geach 1979,\n14). He died unexpectedly two years later, in 1925. \n\nInspired by the work of F.H. Bradley, he published a pamphlet\n“The Further Determination of the Absolute” in 1893. (This\npamphlet is reprinted in his Philosophical Studies.) There he\nargued that there are three stages to demonstrating the\n“idealist’s philosophy”. First, prove that the world\nis not exclusively matter, next prove that it is exclusively spiritual,\nand finally determine the nature of spirituality. He argues that it\nfollows from Hegel’s dialectic that the universe is timeless, and\nthat both knowledge and desire are mere appearance. The true reality\nthat gives rise to these appearances consists in finite spirits\nperceiving and loving one another. The production of “The Further\nDetermination of the Absolute” was an emotional experience as\nwell for McTaggart. He wrote in a letter that “It was like\nturning one’s heart inside\n out” (Dickinson 1931, 37). \n\nThroughout his life, he defended the claim that ultimate reality\nconsists of loving spirits. He did not live to see his final defense in\nprint. He died in 1925, at the age of 58, two years before the second\nvolume of the Nature of Existence was published in 1927 under\nthe editorial care of C.D. Broad. \nF.H. Bradley was an important influence on McTaggart. McTaggart thought\nthat Bradley was “the greatest of living philosophers” and\nonce told G.E. Moore that when Bradley walked in, “he felt as if\na Platonic Idea had entered the\n room”.[4]\nMcTaggart also greatly admired\nSpinoza, enough to have a quotation from Spinoza engraved on his\ntombstone. But McTaggart’s philosophical views were distinctively\nhis own. \nIn turn, McTaggart was influential in the intellectual development of\nG.E. Moore. McTaggart was Moore’s youngest philosophy teacher at\nCambridge. According to Paul Levy what influenced Moore most was\nMcTaggart’s “constant insistence on clearness, on asking\nthe question ‘what does this mean’” (Levy 1981, 60).\nMoore read and commented on early drafts of both\nMcTaggart’s Some Dogmas of Religion, published first in\n1906, and the first volume of the Nature of\n Existence.[5] \n\nBertrand Russell, whose early work was deeply influenced by McTaggart,\nclaims that McTaggart was very shy. In his autobiography, Russell\nwrites: \n\nRussell also tells us later in his autobiography that he wondered if\nhe would ever do as good as work as McTaggart (Russell 1951, 200). \nC.D. Broad described McTaggart, who was his director of studies\nat\n Cambridge (Redpath 1997, 571),\nthusly: \nHe was on most accounts an unusual fellow, with a big head and a\ncrab-like\n walk (Rochelle 1991, 97).\nPeter Geach (1971, 10) reports that,\n“To the end of his days he walked down corridors with a curious\nshuffle, back to the wall, as if expecting a sudden kick from\nbehind.” Unlike F.H. Bradley, whose feline-directed nocturnal\nactivities were not so benign, McTaggart saluted cats whenever he\nmet\n them (Dickinson 1931, 68; Rochelle 1991, 97). \n(F.H.\nBradley preferred to shoot cats; see the entry on \n F. H. Bradley.) His preferred\nmethod of transportation was a tricycle, a fact which led a Cambridge\npaper to publish the following poem about him: \n\nMcTaggart was delighted by this\n poem.[6] \n\nAlthough McTaggart’s early forays in metaphysics employed a\n“Hegelian” dialectical method, McTaggart’s most\nwell-known works proceed in a fashion that would be familiar to some\ncontemporary analytic metaphysicians. \nMcTaggart conducts metaphysics almost entirely from the armchair. In\nthe first chapter of Some Dogmas of Religion, McTaggart\ncharacterizes metaphysics as the systematic study of the ultimate\nnature of reality. He then argues that the empirical sciences, such as\nphysics, cannot replace metaphysical inquiry. The argument is roughly\nas follows. First, the claim that some empirical science such as\nphysics provides knowledge of ultimate reality is not itself a claim of\nphysics, but rather a metaphysical claim made about physics. And as\nsuch the evaluation of this claim goes beyond the province of physics.\nSecond, McTaggart claims that metaphysical materialists, dualists,\nBerkeleyian idealists, and Hegelians all accept the same system of\nscientific propositions, whilst differing amongst themselves on the\nissue of how these propositions are to be interpreted. McTaggart\nconcludes from this claim that there are metaphysical issues remaining\neven after we have settled on our best scientific theory. \nA similar conclusion is defended in chapter 3 of the first volume of\nThe Nature of Existence. McTaggart there raises the following\nworries about using ‘inductive methods’ to arrive at\nmetaphysical results. First, McTaggart claims that the rationality of\nusing induction in general is questionable. According to\nMcTaggart, we need an argument for the rationality of induction, and\nsuch an argument will not be an inductive argument. Second, McTaggart\nraises two specific worries about using inductive arguments to derive\nmetaphysical claims about reality as a whole. The first specific worry\nis that, since there is only one entity that is reality as a whole, we\ncannot use an inductive argument to determine the features of this\nentity. (McTaggart appears to conceive of inductive arguments as\nexemplifying the pattern there are many As and each observed A is\nF, so every A is F.) The second worry is that,\nsince there are infinitely many existing entities (a claim for which\nMcTaggart will argue for later in the Nature of Existence),\nand we observe only finitely many of them, any inductive argument\nmoving from claims about the features of what we observe to the\nfeatures of existent entities in general will be dubious. \nPerhaps McTaggart’s skepticism about the usefulness of empirical\ninquiry for metaphysical investigations is why his twentieth-century\nworks are almost entirely devoid of commentary on the revolutions\noccurring in fundamental physics. (Einstein is mentioned exactly once\nin both volumes of The Nature of Existence, briefly and in\npassing in section 369 of the second volume.) Unlike some of his\nnear-contemporaries, such as A.N. Whitehead and Bertrand Russell,\nMcTaggart proceeds as if he were blithely unaware of the potential for\ninterplay between physics and\n philosophy.[7] \nMcTaggart by and large proceeds deductively by appealing to\npropositions he holds to be synthetic a priori and then deriving\nfurther claims from them. McTaggart does allow that experience has a\nrole to play in metaphysical inquiry, albeit a limited one.\nMcTaggart’s The Nature of Existence explicitly appeals\nto two empirical claims, first that something exists and second that\nwhat exists is differentiated, i.e., has proper parts. McTaggart holds\nthat only the former claim is knowable only by experience; the latter\nclaim is derivable, he claims, from the synthetic a priori position\nthat everything has proper parts. This latter claim will be further\ndiscussed in sections 6 and 8 of this article. \nMoreover, McTaggart grants that the data provided by sense-perception\nare prima facie true. That is, if we seem to perceive P, then\nunless there are compelling a priori reasons or reasons\nderiving from other perceptions to believe ~P, we should\nbelieve P. This principle does real work in McTaggart’s\nsystem. We apparently perceive that objects are ordered in time: some\nevents occur before others, whilst others are simultaneous. McTaggart\nholds that there is a powerful a priori argument that nothing\nis actually in time. (McTaggart’s argument will be discussed in\nsection 6 of this article.) But there is no powerful argument that the\nobjects that are apparently ordered by temporal relations are not\nordered by some other (non-temporal) relation. Perception teaches\nus both that objects are in time and that they are ordered by some\nrelation. Only the former is called into question by McTaggart’s\nargument against the reality of time. In this way, McTaggart arrives at\nthe question: what is the nature of the ordering relation that, in\nconjunction with other facts, gives rise to the appearance that the\nobjects which it orders are in time? \nWere McTaggart alive today, his (perhaps excessive) apriorism would\nprobably put off many of his analytic colleagues. But all of them would\nappreciate his strong desire to make his arguments as clear and as\nrigorous as he could make\n them.[8]\nG.E. Moore, who imbibed this philosophical\nvalue during his time at Cambridge, had this to say: \n\nMcTaggart is most famous for arguing that time is unreal. He was\nattracted to this conclusion early in his career, perhaps as a result\nof his mystical experiences. In June of 1889, McTaggart wrote in a\nletter to Roger Fry that he had some ideas about the elimination of\ntime (1991, 59). His 1896 book Studies in the Hegelian\nDialectic contains an argument for the unreality of time in\nsections 141–142, but this argument is very unlike the ones that\nsucceed it. In 1908, he published “The Unreality of Time”\nin Mind. This argument was later reincarnated in the second\nvolume of the Nature of Existence. \n\nMcTaggart distinguished two ways of ordering events or positions in\ntime. First, they might be ordered by the relation of earlier\nthan. This ordering gives us a series, which McTaggart calls\nthe B-series. A second ordering is imposed by designating some\nmoment within the B-series as the present moment. This second\nordering gives us a series that McTaggart calls the\nA-series. According to McTaggart, in order for time to be\nreal both series must exist, although McTaggart holds that, in some\nsense, the A-series is more fundamental than the B-series.\n \nAlthough there are various ways to reconstruct McTaggart’s\nargument, for our purposes it will suffice to consider the following\none: \n\nTherefore, time is not real. \nMcTaggart has comparatively little to say in support of premise (1).\n(We find McTaggart accepting premise (1) in as early a work as his\nStudies in the Hegelian Dialectic, section 144.) Roughly,\nMcTaggart’s rationale for premise (2) is that the contents of\npositions are events. There is real change only if events change, and\nthe only way an event can change is by first being future, then\npresent, and then past, i.e., by changing positions in the A-series.\nAccording to McTaggart, an event enjoying qualitative variation across\nits temporal axis, such as a poker that begins hot and later cools,\ndoes not constitute an example of real change, since it is always the\ncase that the earlier part of this event is hotter than the later part\nof this event. For this reason, McTaggart rejects the account of\nchange offered by Bertrand Russell in his Principles of\nMathematics (section 442), according to which something changes\njust in case a proposition true of it at one time is not true of it\nwhen evaluated at a later time. (With respect to any\nproposition P, if P has some truth-value when\nevaluated at a time, it is always the case that P has that\ntruth-value when evaluated at that time.) \n\nIn general, McTaggart believes that facts about positions in\nB-series are ‘fixed’ in the sense that they are always true\nno matter which time is present. The only thing left to change then is\nwhich events are actually present. So if there is no A-series, if\nnothing is truly ever present, past or future, then there is no\nchange. \nMcTaggart argues for premise (3) by attempting to demonstrate that the\nexistence of the A-series would generate a contradiction.\nAccording to McTaggart, being present, being past,\nand being future are incompatible determinations. But\neverything in time must have each of them. How best to reconstruct the\n rationale for this premise is highly\n contentious.[9]\n The intuitive picture seems to\nbe this. Consider an event that from our perspective is past. Perhaps\nit is the event of McTaggart first considering the unreality of time.\nFrom the perspective of that event, it is present (and we are future).\nHowever, the ordering generated by the A-series is supposed to be an\nobjective ordering: an A-series is not thereby generated simply by\none’s arbitrary choice of a point of time as the present. Since\nthe respective situations are symmetrical, there is no reason to prefer\none perspective over the other. If we take both perspectives as being\ncorrect, then we must say of some event (and every event by parity of\nreasoning) that it is past, present, and future. So instead we should\nsay that neither perspective is correct, and that the A-series does not\nexist. \n\nAlthough time is unreal, our perception of temporal order is not wholly\ndelusory, for there is a real relation that really orders apparently\ntemporal events in the way that they appear to be ordered in the\nB-series. This relation itself generates a series, which McTaggart\ncalls the C-series. (For this reason, McTaggart describes his denial of\nthe reality of time as Hegelian rather than Kantian, since (on\nMcTaggart’s interpretation) although both thinkers denied the\nreality of time, only Hegel thought that there was an underlying\nreality to which the apparent reality of time corresponded.) Were there\nto be an A-series, the conjunction of it with the C-series would yield\na B-series. \n\nMcTaggart entertained several theories about the nature of the\nC-series. One theory that he did not seriously argue against is the\nview that the C-relation is a primitive transitive, asymmetric relation\nfor which nothing positive may be said concerning\n it.[10]\nI will briefly discuss a\ntheory that he entertains in his article “The Relation of Time to\nEternity”, which was re-published in Mind in 1909 but\nwas written at least two years before. (This article is also reprinted\nin Philosophical Studies.) \nIn this article, McTaggart distinguishes three meanings of the term\n“eternity”: the sense in which time might be eternal in\nthat it is infinitely extended, the sense in which\npropositions (conceived as abstract objects) are eternally or\ntimelessly true, and the sense of eternity that pertains to existent\nthings that are not temporally located. An example of a putatively\neternal being in this sense is a God conceived as existing outside of\ntime. McTaggart focuses on the third sense of “eternal”,\nwhich is the sense in which, given the unreality of time, every\nexistent is eternal. \n\nAlthough the eternal is timeless, some temporal metaphors might more\naptly characterize the eternal than others. Some theists describe the\nlife of the divine being as one that is ‘eternally\npresent’, an expression that on its face is explicitly\ncontradictory. Yet describing the divine life as eternally present\nseems more apt than describing it as eternally past. McTaggart cites\nseveral considerations that favor metaphorically describing the eternal\nas present. First, the present changes only by ceasing to be present\nand the eternal never changes. The constancy of the eternal is like\nthat of the present while it continues to be present. Second,\nmany hold that the present enjoys more reality than the past or the\nfuture, and many also hold that eternal things enjoy more reality than\nthat which is in time. So the present is more like the eternal than is\nthe past, at least in this respect. Third, the role of the eternal in\nour emotional lives seems similar to the role of the present. McTaggart\nclaims that one who loves an eternal God experiences an emotion\nrelevantly like one who loves a presently existing thing, and not at\nall alike the emotion of one who loves something that is merely past or\nyet to be. Finally, neither past things nor future things have causal\nefficacy, but arguably both present and eternal things do. \n\nAlthough these considerations favor metaphorically describing the\neternal as present, they are not decisive. McTaggart argues that there\nis some reason to favor instead metaphorically describing the eternal\nas future. Suppose that time is unreal, but there is a real ordering\ncorresponding to the apparent temporal ordering. In other words,\nsuppose that there is a C-series. One theory of the C-series is that it\nis an adequacy series. The things ordered by the C-series are\nrepresentations of how reality actually is, and the relation\nthat generates the C-series is x is less adequate than y. On\nthis view, states that appear to be present more accurately represent\nreality than states that appear to be past, but both in turn are less\naccurate representations than states that appear to be future. The\nterminal end of the C-series consists in maximally adequate, i.e., true\nrepresentations of how reality is. Reality is timeless. So the final\nstage of a series of representations that gives rise to the appearance\nof a temporal order is a stage that represents reality as being\ntimeless. For this reason, McTaggart holds that it is appropriate to\ndescribe the eternal as being future. \nIn chapters 44–50 of the second volume of the Nature of\nExistence, McTaggart reassesses and rejects the theory that the\nC-series is generated by the relation of being less adequate than. He\nultimately settles on the view that the C-series is an “inclusion\nseries”, one in which each element in the series has as a proper\npart its predecessor in the C-series. The elements of the inclusion\nseries are misperceptions of reality, but they are not ordered merely\nby the relation x is less accurate than y. Strictly,\nMcTaggart distinguishes many C-series, one for which each perceiver,\nbut argues that they are commensurable. The illusion of time is\nsomehow generated by facts about the parthood relations obtaining\nbetween mistaken perceptions, but how exactly this illusion is\ngenerated is a question McTaggart admits to not having an answer. \n\nAccording to McTaggart, although time is unreal, temporal judgments\ncan be well or ill-founded in the sense that, given how things actually\nare, some judgments about time and temporal ordering capture real facts\nabout the underlying reality that gives rise to the appearance of time.\nSo, for example, reality is such that it is better to say that World\nWar I took place after the American civil war than it is to say that\nthe American civil war took place after World War I. Although\nboth judgments are false, the former judgment at least correctly orders\nsome events in a real series, whereas the latter does not. \n\nAlthough McTaggart was an atheist from a very early age, he was\ncertainly a religious person, at least on his own definition of\n“religion”. In chapter 1 of Some Dogmas of\nReligion, McTaggart defined “religion” as “an\nemotion that rests on a conviction of harmony between ourselves and the\nuniverse at large.” According to McTaggart, a necessary condition\non judging that there is harmony between the universe at large and\nourselves is that one judge that the universe is good on the whole\n(Some Dogmas of Religion, section 11). \n\nIn an earlier pamphlet, titled “Dare to Be Wise”\n(reprinted in his Philosophical Studies), McTaggart defined\n“pessimism” as the view that the universe as a whole is\nmore bad than good, and “optimism” as the view that the\nuniverse as a whole is more good than bad. According to\nMcTaggart, whether optimism is true is one of the central religious\nquestions. Probably no philosophical belief was more important to\nMcTaggart than optimism. McTaggart defended optimism very early in his\ncareer, in a pamphlet published in 1893 titled “On the\nFurthermore determination of the Absolute” (reprinted in his\nPhilosophical Studies), and the second volume of the\nNature of Existence concludes with a full-throttled argument for\noptimism.  \nHowever, McTaggart denied that the truth of optimism required the truth\nof theism. As noted earlier, McTaggart was throughout his adult life an\nunwavering atheist. In chapter VI of Some Dogmas of Religion,\nMcTaggart defines “God” as “a being who is personal,\nsupreme, and good.” Although McTaggart’s definition\nrequires that God be a person in the philosophical sense, it neither\nrequires that God be omnipotent nor requires that God be\nomnibenevolent. It merely requires that God be more powerful than any\ncreated thing and that God be more good than evil. McTaggart held that\nthe three most popular arguments for the existence of God, which he\ntook to be the cosmological argument, the argument from design, and the\nargument from goodness, cannot prove the existence of an omnipotent\nGod. McTaggart also raises worries in this chapter about the coherence\nof the notion of omnipotence by calling attention to various paradoxes\nand puzzles surrounding the notion. It should be noted that\nMcTaggart’s conception of omnipotence is very strong: for one to\nbe omnipotent in his sense one must be able to perform impossible\ntasks. \nSome Dogmas of Religion does not contain a direct argument for\nthe non-existence of God, but rather contains rebuttals of arguments\nfor the existence of God. The Nature of Existence does\ncontain a direct argument for atheism, which appears in chapter 43 of\nvolume II. This argument is roughly as follows. At this point in the\nbook, McTaggart believes that he has established that the universe\nconsists of some number of immaterial spirits, each of which is a\nprimary part of the universe. Roughly, to say that the\nxs form primary parts of y is to say that the way of\ncarving up y into the xs is a privileged or\nfundamental way of carving up y. For an intuitive example,\nconsider a sphere whose top half is blue and whose bottom half is red.\nPerhaps the sphere has infinitely many arbitrary undetached parts, but\nthe way of carving the sphere into the top and the bottom half is a\nprivileged way of carving it. McTaggart then argues that, if there is a\nGod, then it is either identical with the sum of all that exists, or is\nthe creator of all that is distinct from God, or is the mere guider and\nshaper of all that is distinct from God. God cannot be the sum of all\nthat exists, since then God would be a person who is composed of other\npersons. But according to McTaggart, no person can have as a part\nanother\n person.[11] \nSecond, God cannot be the creator of all else that exists.\nAccording to McTaggart, that would make God more fundamental than any\nof the other selves that are primary parts of the universe. But all\nselves are equally fundamental. McTaggart has a second argument for the\nconclusion that God cannot be the creator of everything else that\nexists. According to McTaggart, nothing is truly in time. Since time is\nunreal, there can be no creation. However, even if time is unreal,\nMcTaggart believes that we can truly say of two things that there is a\ncausal relation between them. But, if time is unreal, this relation\nmust be symmetric; in order to distinguish the cause from the effect,\nMcTaggart holds that we must appeal to temporal asymmetries, none of\nwhich exist. Since creation is an asymmetric causal relation, and there\nare no such relations if time is unreal, there is no creation, and\nhence God cannot be identified with the creator of everything that is\nnot identical with God. For similar reasons, McTaggart held that there\ncannot be a being who is the shaper and guider of everything that is\nnot him. \nMcTaggart was a mystic. McTaggart held that there are two essential\ncharacteristics of mysticism. (These two characteristics are\narticulated in his article “Mysticism”, which is reprinted\nin Philosophical Studies.) First, mysticism requires the\nrecognition of a unity of the universe that is greater than that\nrecognized by ordinary experience or by science. The universe might be\nhighly unified without it being the case that the apparently\nnumerically distinct parts of the universe are actually identical.\nAccording to McTaggart, Hegel believed in a mystic unity although he\ndid not believe that this unity amounted to numerical identity. On\nMcTaggart’s interpretation, Hegel identified God as a community\nof finite spirits. McTaggart’s own view was substantially the\nsame, although he did not label the community of spirits\n“God”. \n\nA second essential characteristic of mysticism is the view that it\nis possible to be conscious of this unity in a way different from that\nof ordinary discursive thought. We can be conscious of abstract truths\nor of spiritual reality directly in a matter akin to sense perception.\nMcTaggart calls this consciousness “mystic intuition”, and\nthat of which it is a recognition “mystic unity”. Mystic\nunity is more fundamental than mystic intuition. The existence of\nmystic intuition implies the existence of mystic unity, but the clearly\nthe converse does not hold. The universe might be highly unified\nwithout anyone recognizing that it is so. \nFrom a very early age, McTaggart had what he took to be mystical\nexperiences. These experiences presented the world as being\nfundamentally unified by the relation of love. Reality as it appeared\nto him in these experiences consisted fundamentally of immaterial\nspirits who stand in the relation of love to one another. These\nexperiences provided him with great comfort, but he believed that the\nfact that he had them did not provide others with a reason to believe\nin the unity he took them to\n reveal.[12]\nPhilosophical argument was needed to supply\nothers with a reason. \nIn general, McTaggart held that religious (or metaphysical) beliefs\ncannot rest merely on the unfounded convictions of believers, or on\nthe claim that most people believe it, or on that we must believe it\nin order to be happy, or that we should believe it on faith (Some\nDogmas of Religion, section 31).  With respect to matters of\nmetaphysics, we need arguments. According to McTaggart, we also need\nthe courage to search for the truth and to follow the arguments were\nthey lead, even when are unhappy with where they lead. Since\nexperience cannot correct the beliefs of metaphysicians, if a lack of\ncourage leads them astray, nothing will lead them back to the\ntruth. We do not want to be driven to false\ncomfort.[13] \nAlthough McTaggart denied the reality of time, he did in a sense defend\nthe immortality of the self. Since some judgments about time can be\nwell-founded even though false, it might be that judgments about\nwhether we will enjoy life again after our deaths are well-founded.\nMcTaggart held that they were, and moreover defended the view that each\nof us existed prior to our births as\n well.[14] \nMcTaggart endorsed both ontological idealism and\nepistemological realism. Epistemological realism, as loosely\nformulated by McTaggart, is the view that knowledge is true (justified)\nbelief, and that truth consists in correspondence with\n reality.[15]\nOntological\nidealism is the view that the sum total of all that exists consists\nin\n persons.[16]\nAccording to McTaggart, although\nreality is composed of persons, it does not follow that nothing is real\nunless it can be known by some\n person.[17] \n\nMcTaggart’s version of ontological idealism was inspired by\nhis reading of Hegel. In one of his earlier writings, “The\nFurther Determination of the Absolute” (reprinted in his\nPhilosophical Studies), McTaggart tells us that Hegel’s\nview of the absolute spirit is that it is made of finite individuals,\neach of which is individuated by how it is related to the others, and\neach of which perceives that every other self is of the same nature as\nitself. \n\nMcTaggart more or less interpreted Hegel as holding\nMcTaggart’s own view, which is that reality consists of a series\nof either finitely many or infinitely many persons. Reality is\ncomposed of persons and their states, which are parts of them. Each\nperson is perceived by some person or persons, and a person perceives\nanother person either by perceiving the whole person or by perceiving\nsome part of the person. Since, on McTaggart’s view, persons have\ntheir perceptions (and other mental states) as proper parts, one way to\nperceive a person is by perceiving a perception of that\n person.[18]\nBecause\nMcTaggart allows that x might perceive a perception of\ny without y’s perception being also a\nperception of x, McTaggart distinguishes between perceiving a\nperception (or, more generally, any mental state) and having that\nperception (or, more generally, having that mental\n state).[19] \n\nAlthough selves have proper parts, McTaggart denies that any two\nselves can ever share a proper part. Nor is it possible that one self\nis a proper part of another. Further, no experience or mental state in\ngeneral can occur without it being a part of some self. McTaggart\nclaims that these are ultimate synthetic a priori\n truths.[20] \n\nAlthough persons have proper parts, the property of being a person\n(which McTaggart calls personality) is a simple,\nunanalyzable\n quality.[21]\nAlthough the self is, in a sense, a bundle of mental states, not every\nbundle of mental states is a\n self.[22]\nWe are acquainted with the property\npersonality, and contra Hume, Bradley, and perhaps Bertrand\nRussell, each of us is acquainted with something that has this\nproperty, namely oneself. \nOn McTaggart’s view, our perceptions are grossly mistaken about\nhow things are. It is not clear whether McTaggart holds that our\nperceptions are grossly mistaken about what there is. When a\nmisperception represents the world as containing material objects, are\nthere some objects such that we misperceive them as being\nmaterial? \nIn the second volume of the Nature of Existence, McTaggart\nendorsed the view that we never directly perceive material objects, but\nrather infer material objects from what we directly\n perceive.[23]\nSo, on\nMcTaggart’s view, strictly speaking perception never represents\nobjects as being material\n objects.[24]\nPerception, however, does represent the\nexistence of sense-data. But McTaggart also denies that anything is\na\n sense-datum.[25]\nHowever, apparent perceptions of sense-data are really perceptions of\nsomething, namely persons, parts of persons, or sums of person-parts.\nSo my perceptions do succeed in correctly representing the existence of\nsomething other than myself, although my perceptions grossly\nmisrepresent the nature of what is\nperceived. \nWhy do we misperceive our perceptions of persons or their parts as\nbeing perceptions of sense-data? Unlike the case of material\nobjects, when we perceive something as a sense-datum, our perception\nitself (rather than a judgment we are led to by the perception) is\nmistaken. McTaggart hypothesizes that, if there is a single cause\nof this widespread error, it must be connected with the fact that we\nmisperceive a C-series as an A-series. This hypothesis is somewhat\nsupported by the fact that whenever we perceive some object, we always\nperceive that object as being in\n time.[26]\nSo the appearance of time is systematically\nconnected with every appearance of something else, and is possibly\nresponsible for radically distorting how that something else appears.\n \nMcTaggart’s argument for ontological idealism resists easy\nsummary. In outline, the main moves are as follows. McTaggart first\nargues that every substance is gunky, that is, every substance\nis such that it has a proper part that is also a substance. So for each\nsubstance, there is an infinite series of substances that are parts of\nit (Nature of Existence I, chapter XXII). McTaggart holds\nthat a priori reflection reveals that every substance is necessarily\ngunky, although there might be respects in which some substance is\nsimple. (Were there to be persisting material atoms, there might be\nentities that lack spatial parts, but they would nonetheless have\ntemporal parts.) \n\nSecond, according to McTaggart, for each substance, there must be a\nsufficient description of that substance (Nature of Existence\nI, section 105). A substance is described by mentioning its\nqualities. An exclusive description of a substance is a description\nthat applies only to that substance. A sufficient description of a\nsubstance is an exclusive description that mentions only qualities that\nmake no reference to other substances (Nature of Existence I,\nsections\n 101–102).[27] \nThird, given that each substance must have a sufficient description,\nthe gunkyness of substances implies a contradiction if substances are\neither material objects or sense-data. McTaggart holds that the\ngunkyness of substances and the requirement that every substance have\nsufficient description result in a contradiction unless the following\nrequirement is satisfied: that the universe divides itself into a set\nof entities – call them primary parts – whose\nsufficient descriptions imply sufficient descriptions of every set of\nparts of the universe onto infinity. In order for the sufficient\ndescriptions of primary parts to imply the sufficient descriptions of\nall others, there must exist a relation of ‘determining\ncorrespondence’ such that all other objects are individuated by\nstanding in the transitive closure of that relation to the primary\nparts, which in turn are individuated independently of standing in any\nrelation of determining\n correspondence.[28] \n\nIf material objects or sensa are part of reality, either there is no\nrelation suitable to be a relation of determining correspondence or\nthere are no objects suitable to serve as primary parts of the universe\nbecause they could not be individuated prior to standing in such\na\n relation.[29]\nOne of McTaggart’s arguments for\nthis conclusion has as a premise that objects with spatial properties,\nsuch as material objects, always have their natures in virtue of the\nnatures of their parts. But in this case, unless some material objects\nare such that at each level of their decomposition into proper parts,\nnew qualities sufficient to describe them uniquely are present, no\nmaterial object could serve as a primary part of the universe.\nMcTaggart then argues that no such qualitative variation is to be found\nin the actual\n world.[30] \n\nHowever, if the primary parts of reality are persons and the\nrelation of determining correspondence is the relation of perception,\nthen McTaggart holds that every substance can have a sufficient\ndescription even though every substance is\n gunky.[31]\nSince it is possible\nthat every spiritual substance be both gunky and have a sufficient\ndescription, idealism is a live option. That it is possible does not\nshow conclusively that it is actual, but according to McTaggart, absent\nany better hypothesis, it is the one that is reasonable to accept.\nMcTaggart holds that we can conceive of nothing that is not a material\nobject, a sense-datum, or something spiritual, and since the first two\nkinds of objects are metaphysically impossible, the hypothesis of\nidealism is the only conceivable hypothesis left standing. \n\nMcTaggart, unlike many of the idealists that were his contemporaries,\nwas a friend of the reality of relations and a kind of metaphysical\npluralist. \n\nMcTaggart’s realism about relations seems to be a relatively\nmild realism: he believes in the existence of relations, and grants\nthat statements attributing relations to things might be true to the\nfullest degree, but it is not clear the extent to which he believed\nthat facts about the obtainings of relations were\nmetaphysically\n basic.[32]\nIt is true that the notion of perception, which is on the face of it a\nrelational notion, plays a fundamental role in his idealistic system.\nRecall that McTaggart held that reality consists of immaterial selves\nthat are unified by perceiving each other. What is not clear is whether\nMcTaggart believed that whenever some x perceives some\ny, it is virtue of the intrinsic qualities of x and\ny. (In one sense of the term “intrinsic relation”,\nperception would be an intrinsic relation if this claim were\ntrue.) \n\nMcTaggart believed that the most extreme kind of monism, namely the\ndoctrine that there is exactly one thing, is incoherent. For if there\nwere exactly one thing, it could have no attributes or features, and\nhence, on McTaggart’s view, would really be\n nothing.[33]\nFor this\nreason, McTaggart held that we must not think of ‘the absolute\nspirit’ as an undifferentiated unity. In McTaggart’s early\npaper, “The Further Determination of the Absolute”,\nMcTaggart argues that if the absolute has features, then it must have\nparts standing in relations to one another. \nMcTaggart also rejected the less radical version of monism that holds\nthat there is only one substance. In first volume of the Nature of\nExistence, sections 65 and 73, McTaggart defined\n“substance” as that which has features without being a\nfeature. In his later article, “an Ontological Idealism”,\nhe defines “substance” as that which has features without\nbeing a feature or having a feature as a part. The reason for the\nrevision is that at this point in McTaggart’s career, he accepted\nthe existence of facts construed as complexes of particulars\nand properties. Facts satisfy the older definition of\n“substance” but not the newer one. McTaggart argues\nthat we perceive that there are many substances, but also holds that it\nis a priori that, if there is one substance, then there are many, since\nit is a priori that every substance has infinitely many parts.\nMcTaggart also rejected solipsism understood as the view that\nreality consists of a single person, which although infinitely divided\nis such that nothing exists that is not a part of him. Solipsism thus\nunderstood is strictly compatible with the existence of a plurality of\nsubstances; however, McTaggart held that solipsism was ruled out by the\nrequirement that there be a relation of determining\n correspondence.[34] \n\nInterestingly, although McTaggart holds that some pantheistic\nphilosophers of the east held the view that there is exactly one\nsubstance, McTaggart denies that Spinoza held this view, and moreover\ndoes not attribute the view to his contemporaries, such as F.H.\nBradley. His pluralism consists in the fact that individual selves are\nthe fundamental units of being in his theory: from facts about the\nselves, all else follows. He is clearly a monist in the sense that he\nbelieved that all substances are immaterial substances. \n\nMcTaggart was a systematic metaphysician and so did what systematic\nmetaphysicians do: on his way to defending one metaphysical view, he\nended up defending several. We will briefly discuss some of the\ninteresting positions he advocated. \n\nHyper-essentialism. McTaggart endorsed a radical form of\nessentialism. Any individual substance save reality as a whole has all\nof its features essentially. In several places, McTaggart seems to\nassert that it is meaningless to ascribe modal features to reality as a\nwhole. See, for example, Studies in the Hegelian Dialectic,\nsection 47, and remarks made in his “The Further Determination of\nthe Absolute”. This view is motivated by the thought that,\nalthough a substance is distinct from its nature understood as the sum\nof its qualities, it nonetheless is individuated by its nature and so\nmust have it essentially. (See the first volume of the Nature of\nExistence, sections 109–113). McTaggart calls the relation between\nthe parts of a substances’ nature extrinsic\ndetermination, since, given the existence of that substance, all\nof those properties that are parts of that subject’s nature must\nexist and so in that sense determine each other. \n\nMcTaggart seems to have flirted with a kind of counterpart theory as a\nway to soothe intuitions that substances might have had different\nproperties than the ones that they in fact have. After considering the\nconsequences of his view for the modal profile of ordinary objects,\nsuch as the mountain Snowdon, he writes: \n\nAlthough the actual Snowdon couldn’t have been shorter, there\ncould have been a mountain sufficiently like it to warrant us giving it\nthe name “Snowdon.” \nReality and Existence. McTaggart distinguished between\nreality and existence, both of which he held to be\nsimple and undefinable qualities. According to McTaggart, the concept\nof being is the same as the concept of reality, and so it is a\ntautology to say whatever is, is\n real.[35]\nReality is a monadic property, and does not\ncome in degrees. Existence is not to be identified with the conjunctive\nproperty of being real and being spatiotemporal, for McTaggart held\nthat no existent is\n spatiotemporal.[36]\nMoreover, reality is not to be\nidentified with existence, since it is conceptually possible that\nsomething might be real without existing. \nThat said, everything that is real might also exist. The first portion\nof McTaggart’s the Nature of Existence is devoted to\nshowing that either reality and existence are in fact coextensive, or,\nfailing this, that can learn everything important about what is real by\nstudying what exists. As part of the project of showing this, McTaggart\nargues against the reality of some putative entities that might be\ntaken to be real but non-existent. For example, McTaggart argues that\nthere is no reason to believe propositions (construed as\nabstract objects). According to McTaggart, truth is a relation\nnot between a proposition and a fact but rather between a belief and a\nfact, whereas falsity is a relation between a belief and all\nthe facts: to be false is to fail to correspond with any fact.\nMoreover, on McTaggart’s view, there are no non-existent\nfacts. \nMcTaggart also dispenses with possibilities, and argues that\nall statements about possibilities are best understood as concerning\nconnections between existing things. Statements apparently about\npossibilities are really statements about actualities: they are about\nthe actual implications and non-implications of various characteristics\nhad by actual entities. (See section 40 of the first volume of the\nNature of Existence for further discussion.) \nMereological Doctrines. McTaggart holds the following\ndoctrines concerning the part-whole relation as it applies to\nsubstances. First, McTaggart endorses unrestricted\ncomposition: whenever there are some substances, there is a\nfurther substance that is composed of them. McTaggart dismisses the\nworry that unrestricted composition implies that there are bizarre\nsubstances such as the substance composed of all the readers of the SEP\nand the moon. (See chapter 16 of the first volume of the Nature of\nExistence.) For this reason, McTaggart holds that there is a\nsubstance that is composed of everything that there is. He calls this\nsubstance “the Universe”. (See section 77 and chapter 18 of\nthe first volume of the Nature of Existence.) \n\nSecond, McTaggart accepts that the doctrine of temporal\nparts is well-founded: if time is real, then objects have temporal\nparts corresponding to each moment at which they exist. If time is\nunreal, then objects have parts corresponding to each node in the real\nC-series that they occupy. This view is articulated in several places\nin both volumes of the Nature of Existence, and it plays a\nminor argumentative role in section 163 of volume I.\nInterestingly, McTaggart does not explicitly argue for the\ndoctrine, but rather seems to think that the doctrine of temporal parts\nwill be ‘generally admitted’. (See the second volume of\nthe Nature of Existence, section 412.) \n\nThird, McTaggart argues that it is a priori that every\nsubstance is gunky. A substance is gunky just in case it has\nproper parts, and every proper part of that substance in turn has\nfurther proper parts. Chapter 22 of the first volume of the Nature\nof Existence contains a defense of this position. \nFourth, McTaggart distinguishes between compound substances and\ngroups. A compound substance is a substance that has other\nsubstances as proper parts. On McTaggart’s view, every substance\nis a compound substance. A group also has substances as proper parts,\nbut it not merely a compound substance. Rather, it is something more\nakin to a set or a collection. However, McTaggart\nexplicitly claims that groups are not classes because a class is\n“determined by a class-concept, while a group is determined by a\ndenotation.” (See page 276 of “An Ontological\nIdealism” in his Philosophical Studies, as well as\nchapter XV of the first volume of the Nature of Existence,\nwherein he claims that classes are determined by properties.) \n\nIn addition to having substances as parts, groups have them\nas members. On McTaggart’s view, parthood is not\nsufficient for membership. Although the parthood relation is\ntransitive, the membership relation is not. According to McTaggart,\nwhenever there are some substances, they also form a group, and\nwhenever there are some groups they too from a group. Although there is\na universal substance, no group contains all the other groups. Finally,\nno group contains itself as a part. McTaggart appears to have an\niterative conception of the group-theoretic hierarchy, although he\ndenies that there are groups with only one or fewer members. \nOne puzzling feature of McTaggart’s mereological system is his\napparent acceptance of a form of relative identity: x\nand y might be the same substance while simultaneously being\ndifferent groups. In section 128 of the first volume of the Nature\nof Existence, McTaggart considers the group consisting of the\ncounties of Great Britain and the group consisting of the parishes of\nGreat Britain. McTaggart argues that although these are not the same\ngroups, we ought to say that they are the same substance. He does not\nappear to merely mean that this substance may be partitioned in two\ndifferent ways, and that corresponding to these ways are two\nnumerically distinct groups. \n\nIt is fair to say that McTaggart dedicated much more of philosophical\nenergy to metaphysics than ethics. That said, McTaggart did have\ninteresting ethical views, some of which will be discussed here. \n\nIn the Hegelian phase of McTaggart’s career, McTaggart defended a\nform of consequentialism in which the ultimate good coincided with what\nis ultimately real: a series of persons each of whose final end is in\ncomplete harmony with the universe (and so with the final ends of every\nother individual), resulting in the happiness of each\n individual.[37]\nAlthough the\nproduction of this ultimate good is our obligation, it is exceedingly\ndifficult for us to know which actions of ours are what we ought to do.\nFor this reason, McTaggart suggests that we need a\n‘criterion’ for moral rightness, i.e., a decision-procedure\nsuch that if we follow it we are most apt to do what we ought to do.\nMcTaggart argues that a form of hedonistic utilitarianism is the best\ncriterion for moral rightness that we can reasonably hope\n for.[38]\nMcTaggart\ngrants that sometimes this criterion could give incorrect results, and\nthat since following it is not a certain guide to what is right, we\nmust admit that our ethical knowledge is limited and incomplete. \n\nThe latter McTaggart was a moral realist cut from the same cloth as\nhis former student G.E. Moore. He held that (intrinsic)\ngoodness and badness were simple qualities, not\nreducible to non-normative properties, and not reducible to the\nrelation is intrinsically better than. (See chapter 64 of the\nsecond volume of the Nature of Existence for\ndiscussion.) \n\nThe fundamental bearers of intrinsic value are either\npersons (or other conscious beings) or states of\npersons (which in turn he took to be proper parts of\npersons). Because no person is a part of another person, the universe\nitself cannot be taken to be a fundamental bearer of intrinsic\nvalue. Therefore, one can say of the universe that it is intrinsically\ngood or intrinsically bad only if one means by this either something\nabout the average value of parts of the universe or by their total\nvalue. (This view is defended in “The Individualism of\nValue”, reprinted in Philosophical Studies.)  McTaggart\nopts for the latter view, and for this reason, McTaggart\naccepts the repugnant conclusion, which is that a universe\ncontaining millions of people whose lives are barely worth living\nmight be better than a world containing far fewer people, each of whom\nlive lives of spectacular value. McTaggart notes that this conclusion\nwould be repugnant to certain moralists, but sees no reason to think\n‘repugnance in this case would be right.’ (See section 870\nof the second volume of the Nature of Existence.) \n\nAlthough persons or states of persons are the bearers of intrinsic\nvalue, they have their value in virtue of having other properties.\nMcTaggart was an ethical pluralist, granting that many different sorts\nof properties can contribute to the value of a state of a person.\nPleasure and pain are both intrinsically valuable (the latter having\nnegative value, of course), and both are present in timeless reality.\nPain is always intrinsically bad, regardless of whether the recipient\nof the pain deserves to be in pain. On the basis of this claim,\nMcTaggart argued against the justifiability of vindictive punishment.\n(See Some Dogmas of Religion, section 133, as well as\n“Hegel’s Theory of Punishment”, which further\ndevelops this view; chapter five of Studies in Hegelian\nCosmology is devoted to a discussion of punishment.) And\nunfortunately, delusory perceptions, of which we are susceptible, are\nintrinsically bad. For this reason, McTaggart concludes that absolute\nreality is not free from intrinsic disvalue. (Even if pain is illusory,\nthe illusion that there is pain is real, and is itself bad. See\nhis Studies in the Hegelian Dialectic, page 155.) For this\nreason, Hegel’s attempts to prove that the absolute is perfect\nare doomed to\n failure.[39] \nLove is central in McTaggart’s theory of the good. Love is not to\nbe identified with benevolence, which McTaggart did not regard as an\nemotion but rather as a desire to do good for others. Furthermore, love\nis not to be identified with sympathy or sexual desire, but may\noccasion both. Love is not invariably caused by pleasure and it does\nnot invariably cause pleasure. We might be caused to love someone\nbecause of that person’s qualities, but we do not love that\nperson’s qualities but rather the person himself. We can love a\nperson whom we do not believe to be good. \n\nAccording to McTaggart, love is “supremely” good. By\nthis, McTaggart does not mean that love is incommensurably better than\nall other goods; were it, the smallest increase in love would be\ngreater than any other increase in any other valuable thing. However,\nlove is supreme in the following way: there is some amount of\nlove such that that particular amount of love is greater in intrinsic\nvalue than any amount of any other good. On McTaggart’s\nview, the goodness of other goods asymptotically approach the goodness\nof that amount of love, whereas the goodness of love enjoys no upper\nbound. (See sections 850–853 of the second volume of the\nNature of Existence.) \nThe optimistic conclusion of the Nature of Existence is that\ntimeless reality consists of persons who experience tremendous love for\neach other. The quantity of love is sufficient in value to dwarf any\nevils that remain. McTaggart argues that the value of this quantity of\nlove might well be\n infinite.","contact.mail":"kmcdani1@nd.edu","contact.domain":"nd.edu"}]
