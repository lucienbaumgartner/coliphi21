It has not, however, been subject to the same kind of intense\ndebate and scrutiny as, for example, the semantics of definite\ndescriptions or of propositional attitude verbs. Many\nphilosophers probably share Davidson’s experience: ‘When I was\ninitiated into the mysteries of logic and semantics, quotation was\nusually introduced as a somewhat shady device, and the introduction\nwas accompanied by a stern sermon on the sin of confusing the use and\nmention of expressions’ (Davidson 1979, p. 79). Those who leave\nit at that, however, miss out on one of the most difficult and\ninteresting topics in the philosophy of language.\n\nConsider the following \n sentences:[1]\n\n(1)\n\n‘Snow is white’ is true in English iff snow is white.\n\n\n(2)\n\n‘Aristotle’ refers to Aristotle.\n\n\n(3)\n\n‘The’ is the definite article in English.\n\n\n(4)\n\n‘Bachelor’ has eight letters.\n\n\nQuotation interests philosophers and linguists for various reasons,\nincluding these:\n\nWhen language is used to attribute properties to language or\notherwise theorize about it, a linguistic device is needed that\n‘turns language on itself’. Quotation is one such device.\nIt is our primary meta-linguistic tool and if you don’t\nunderstand quotation, then you can’t understand sentences like\n(1)–(4). Those who are in the business of theorizing about\nlanguage are particularly interested in understanding the mechanisms\nthat render (1)–(4) intelligible.\n\nTheories of quotation address questions not just about\nhow quotations refer, but also about what they refer\nto. In this regard, theories of quotation tell us what we are talking\nabout in (1)–(4).\n\nQuotation is a paradigmatic opaque context, i.e. a context in\nwhich substitution of synonymous or co-referential expressions can fail\nto preserve truth-value. To understand the nature of opacity you must\nunderstand how quotation functions.\n\nQuotation is a device for talking about language, but it does so\nin a particularly tricky way: somehow quotation manages to use its\nreferent to do (or at least to participate in) the referring. Putting\nquotation marks around a word creates a device that refers to that\nvery word: ‘‘Aristotle’’ refers to\n‘Aristotle’. As such, quotation is a particularly\ninteresting referential device.\n\nAs with all issues in the philosophy of language, theories of\nquotation harbor assumptions about how best to draw the distinction\nbetween semantics and pragmatics, and they do so in a particularly\nilluminating way.\n\nAccounting for quotation presents some interesting technical\nchallenges in formal semantics, attempting to resolve which can shed\nlight on our understanding of such fundamental notions as\nindexicality, monstrosity, and compositionality.\nThe entry is structured as follows:\n\n\n\nProblems arise right at the outset since quotation is not an easy\nthing to characterize. We start with reflections on how one might try to do so. \n\nThere’s an easy and relatively non-controversial way to\nidentify quotation: it is the sort of linguistic\nphenomenon exemplified by the subject in (4) and the direct\n object[2]\n in (5); these are instances of pure and direct\nquotation, respectively. \n\nThat leaves open the question of which semantic and syntactic devices\nbelong to that sort. Any characterization of a more specific nature,\neither of a syntactic or a semantic sort, moves into controversial\nterritory immediately. \n\nA syntactic characterization might go something like this:\nTake two quotation marks— single apostrophes in Britain,\ndouble in the United States, double angles in parts of Europe —\nand put, for example, a letter, a word, or a sentence between the two.\nWhat results is a quotation, as in (4)–(5). But then consider\nthe following sentences: \nWe can see there are two problems with the syntactic\ncharacterization: \n\nOther devices employed as substitutes for quotation marks include bold\nface, indentation, and line indentation (cf. Quine 1940, pp. 23–24;\nGeach 1957, p. 82). There’s no clear limit on the range of distinct\nwritten options, other than that they are used as quotation marks, but\nthis renders the syntactic characterization incomplete, and thus,\nunsatisfactory. \n\nAnother tempting strategy is to say that an expression is quoted if\nit is mentioned. There are two problems with this\ncharacterization. \n\nIn order to remain as neutral as possible, we will stick with a\nsimple identification-through-examples strategy, and emphasize that it\nis an open question as to how to identify the sort of linguistic\ndevices to which the subject in (4) belongs. \n\nQuotation is a subject matter that brings together a rather\nspectacular array of linguistic and semantic issues. Here are six basic\nquotational features of particular importance (BQ1–BQ6, for short) that\nwill guide our search for an adequate account: \n\nBQ1. In quotation you cannot substitute\nco-referential or synonymous terms salva veritate.\n \nAn inference from (4) to (8), for example, fails to preserve\ntruth-value. \n\nNo theory of quotation is adequate unless it explains this feature\n(and no theory of opacity is complete before it explains why quotation\nhas this feature). \n\nBQ2. It is not possible to quantify into\nquotation. \n\n(9), for example, does not follow from (4): \n\nAn adequate theory of quotation must explain why not. The product of\nquoting ‘x’ is an expression that refers to the\n24th letter of the Roman alphabet. The point is that\nquotation marks, at least in natural language, cannot be quantified\ninto because they trap the variable; what results is a quotation that\nrefers to that very variable. \n\nBQ3. Quotation can be used to introduce novel\nwords, symbols and alphabets; it is not limited to the extant lexicon\nof any one language. Both (10) and (11) are true English sentences: \n\nAn adequate theory of quotation must explain what makes this\npractice possible. \n\nBQ4. There’s a particularly close relationship\nbetween quotations and their semantic values. \n\n“lobsters” and its semantic value are more intimately\nrelated than ‘lobster’ and its semantic value, i.e., the\nrelationship between “lobster” and ‘lobster’\nis closer than that which obtains between ‘lobsters’ and\nlobsters. Whereas the quotation (i.e., “lobster”), in some\nway to be further explained, has its referent (i.e.,\n‘lobster’) contained in it, the semantic value of\n‘lobsters’, i.e., lobsters, are not contained in\n‘lobster’. One way to put it is that an expression e is\nin the quotation of e. No matter how one chooses to spell\nthis out, any theory of quotation must explain this relationship. \n\nBQ5. To understand quotation is to have an\ninfinite capacity, a capacity to understand and generate a potential\ninfinity of new quotations. \n\nWe don’t learn quotations one by one. Never having encountered the\nquotation in (10) or (11) does nothing to prohibit comprehending them\n(Christensen 1967, p. 362) and identifying their semantic values. \n\nSimilarly, there doesn’t seem to be any upper bound on a\nspeaker’s ability to generate novel quotations. One natural\nexplanation for this is that quotation is a productive device\nin natural language. \n\nBQ6. Quoted words can be simultaneously used\nand mentioned. \n\n(12) is called a ‘mixed quotation’. This is because it\nmixes the direct quotation (as in (5)) and indirect (as in (13)). \n\nIn this regard, the quotation in (12) is, in an intuitive sense,\nsimultaneously used and mentioned. It is used to say what Quine said\n(viz. that quotation has a certain anomalous feature), and\nalso to say that Quine used the words ‘has a certain anomalous\nfeature’ in saying it. \n\nMixed quotation had not been much discussed prior to Davidson (1979)\nbut it has recently taken center stage in discussions of theories of\nquotation. For those who believe themselves unfamiliar with the data,\nwe point out that mixed quotation is one of the most\nfrequently used forms of quotation. Casually peruse any newspaper and you will find passages like the following from the New York Times: \nIn the 21st century, mixed quotation has become one of the central\ntopics in the theory of quotation: a range of interesting data has\nbeen brought to light and a flurry of theories have been\ndefended. In Section 4 below we introduce some of the\ndata. \n\nIn what follows we will refer back to these six features and make\nthe following assumption: \n\nIt is a necessary adequacy condition on a theory of quotation that it\neither explains how quotations can exhibit features (BQ1)–(BQ6),\nor, if it fails to do so, then it must present an argument for why any\nunexplained feature doesn’t require explanation. \nBefore going on, an important note: quotation, perhaps more than any other area of language, is difficult because not only is there no consensus about what the correct theory is, but there’s also basic disagreements about the space of options, and about the data to be accounted for. We’ll see this below, but it’s important to bear in mind that when it comes to quotation, the consensus is that there’s no consensus, and disagreement is the norm. \n\nBQ1–BQ6 play an important role because theories of quotation are\nattempts to answer certain questions, and those questions won’t have\nsatisfactory answers unless BQ1–BQ6 are accounted for. Three questions\ncan be thought of as the guiding questions for a theory of\nquotation: \n\nAlternatively, one might hold that quotations fail to refer at all,\nbut rather that speakers refer contingent upon the intentions with\nwhich they use an expression—with or without quotation\nmarks. \n\nQ2. How do quotations refer? \n\nAre they names, descriptions, demonstratives, functors or some\nsui generis linguistic category? \n\nIn addition to Q1 and Q2, theories of quotation often try answer a\nthird question: \n\nQ3. What do quotations refer to? \n\nWhat kinds of objects are picked out? Is it always the same object\nor are quotations\n ambiguous?[4] \n\nOur primary focus in what follows will be in Q1 and Q2, but along\nthe way we will also address Q3. \n (Section 5 is entirely devoted to Q3.) \n\nIt is standard practice in philosophy to distinguish the\nuse of an expression from the mentioning of it.\nConfusing these two is often taken to be a philosophical mortal sin.\nDespite its ubiquitous appeal, it is controversial exactly how to draw\nthe distinction. The initial thought is easy enough. Consider (D1) and\n(D2): \n\nD1. Jim went to Paris \n\nD2. ‘Jim’ has three letters \n\nIn (D1) the word ‘Jim’ is used to talk about (or signify,\nor denote) a person, i.e. Jim, and the sentence says about that person\nthat he went to Paris. In (D2) the word is not used in that way.\nInstead, ‘Jim’ is used to talk about (or signify or denote)\na word, i.e. ‘Jim’, and the sentence says about that word\nthat it has three\n letters[5].\nIn (D1), ‘Jim’ is being\nused and in (D2) it is being mentioned. \nThe initial thought seems right as far as it goes, but it might be thought it doesn’t go far enough. One might hope that we could say more to flesh it out in an uncontroversial way, a theory-neutral way that any party to the debate could agree on. In fact, though (and this is not recognized enough), this is not straightforward. To see this, consider a couple of ways to try to build on the initial characterization:\n \n\nA problem with this is that according to some theories, an expression can be mentioned\nwithout being quoted (see Objection 3 in section 3.3.2). \n\nThis is problematic in a couple of ways. First, notice that according to (ii), E must be\nused in order to mention it; that’s potentially puzzling. More\nsignificantly, it is controversial whether standard meta-linguistic\ndevices such as quotation are referring expressions. The theories\npresented in sections 3.2 and 3.3 treat quotations as descriptions. If\ndescriptions are quantified expressions, then quotations are\nquantifiers, and quantifiers are typically not treated as referring\nexpressions. Proposals along the lines of (ii) would also have to\nensure that ‘the first seven words in this sentence’ in\n(D3) don’t end up referring to ‘the first seven words in this\nsentence’: \n\nD3. The first seven words in this sentence contain thirty-two\nletters. \n\nWhat this suggests is that any attempt to\ncharacterize the distinction between use and mention\nmore sophisticated than the initial characterization in this section\nwill need to address at least some of the tricky issues that face the\nvarious theories of quotation we describe in what follows. \n\nThere are, roughly, five kinds of theories of quotation that have been\ncentral to the discussion of quotation: the Proper Name Theory, the\nDescription Theory, the Demonstrative/Paratactic Theory, the\nDisquotational Theory, and the Use/Identity Theory. (See here\nMaier’s taxonomy (2014b), which just includes the first four\ntheories, and which evaluates them according in terms of formal\ndesiderata like compositionality and productivity, and cf. Saka 2013,\nwhich includes ten. This divergence, incidentally, is a good\nillustration of the point we made above about lack of consensus among\ntheorists of quotation.) In the following sections we discuss each of\nthese and review their strengths and weaknesses. \n\nIt is now almost a tradition in the literature on quotation to include\na brief dismissive discussion of the Proper Name Theory of\nQuotation. This view is described, although not clearly endorsed, in\npassages in Quine and Tarski (e.g., Quine 1940, pp. 23–26; 1961,\np. 140; Tarski 1933, p. 159ff), and comments in passing in both\nReichenbach (1947, p. 335) and Carnap (1947, p. 4) strongly suggest\nthey were adherents. That said, there is some debate about whether\nQuine and Tarski ever held the view (see, e.g., Bennett 1988, Richard\n1986, Saka 1998, and Gomez-Torrente 2001). It is worth mentioning that\nalthough we quote them below, we do not thereby mean to attribute the\nProper Name Theory to them; we do so merely because they describe it\nclearly. \nUntil recently, it was generally held that the name theory was\n‘an utter failure’ (Saka 1998, p. 114), of interest only as\nshowing us how not to theorize about quotation. In recent years,\nhowever, there have been at least two defenses of something like the\nname theory (Gomez-Torrente 2013 and Johnson 2018). We here present\nthe reasons the name theory was long taken to be a non-starter, as\nwell as the responses to these problems by the authors mentioned\nabove. \n\nAccording to the Proper Name Theory, quotations are unstructured\nproper names of the quoted expressions. Quine writes: \n\nThe personal name buried within the first word of the statement\n‘‘Cicero’ has six letters’, e.g., is logically no more\ngermane to the statement than is the verb ‘let’ which is\nburied within the last word. (Quine 1940, p.  26) \n\nTarski formulates the view as follows: \n\nThe Proper Name Theory nicely accommodates (BQ1)–(BQ3); that is, on\nthis theory we see why co-referential expressions cannot be substituted\nfor one another. According to the Proper Name Theory, the name\n‘Cicero’ does not occur in\n‘‘Cicero’’; from the mere fact that Cicero = Tully, it does not follow that \n‘Tully’ can be substituted for ‘Cicero’ in\n‘‘Cicero’’. As Quine puts it, ‘[t]o make\nsubstitution upon a personal name, with such a context, would be no\nmore justifiable than to make a substitution upon the term\n‘cat’ within the context ‘cattle’ (Quine 1961,\np. 141). The Proper Name Theory permits the creation of new quotations\nmuch as natural languages permit the introduction of new names. And it\nprohibits quantifying in, since each quotation is a single word, and\nso there is nothing to quantify into. To see that this is so, think of\nthe left and right quotation marks as the 27th and\n28th letters of the roman alphabet; in that case quantifying into\n(4) in deriving (9) makes as much sense as deriving (16) from (14) and\n(15) by quantifying into (14): \n\nThe occurrence of the 24th letter of the alphabet in (9),\nas Quine notes with regards to a similar sentence, ‘is as\nirrelevant to the quantifier that precedes it as is the occurrence of\nthe same letter in the context ‘six’’ (Quine 1961, p.\n147). \n\nHere are three objections to the Proper Name Theory of Quotation.\n(The main objections are in Davidson (1979, pp. 81–83), though some\nwere anticipated by Geach (1957, p.79ff).) \n\nObjection 1: The Proper Name Theory cannot\nexplain how we can generate and interpret an indefinite number of novel\nquotations (see BQ5).\n\n \n\nIf quotations were proper names and lacked semantic structure\naltogether, then there would be no rule for determining how to\ngenerate or interpret novel quotations. To understand one would be to\nlearn a new name. (Remember, the quotation marks, according to Quine,\ncarry no more significance than the serifs you see on these letters.)\nBut (11), e.g., can be understood by someone who has never encountered\nits quoted symbol before. \n\nUnderstanding (11) is not like understanding a sentence with a\npreviously unknown proper name. Upon encountering (11), it would seem that\nyou know exactly which symbol is being referenced in a way that you do not with\na name you’ve never before encountered. \nFor a long time, this objection was thought fatal. However, a paper by\nMario Gomez-Torrente (2013) suggests a way to square something like\nthe name view with Objection 1. In brief, he points out that there are\nsome names that can be indefinitely generated and interpreted. For\nexample, street names. ‘East 6th Street’, presumably, is a\nbona fide name, but one doesn’t either need to individually\nbestow it on the particular street it applies to (the street between\nEast 5th and East 7th), nor does one need to have already learned it\nto understand what ‘East 6th Street has some great bars’\nmeans. \n\nObjection 2: There’s a special relationship\nbetween quotations and their semantic values (see BQ4).\n\n \n\nAccording to the Proper Name Theory, the relationship between\n“lobsters” and ‘lobsters’ is no closer than\nthe relationship between ‘lobsters’ and lobsters. That\nseems to miss the fundamental aspect of quotation spelled out in\n(BQ4). \n\nDavidson summarizes these first two objections succinctly: \nAgain, however, some work has pushed back against these old\nobjections. Michael Johnson (forthcoming) points to some names which\nbear special relationships to their referents. In particular, he\npoints to onomatopoeia. For example, ‘buzz’\nrefers to a sound, a buzzing sound. But the word ‘buzz’,\nwhen uttered, makes the sound it refers to. Roughly speaking, Johnson\nholds that we could view quotations in the same way: as he says,\n‘the name of a person sounds like the name of his name’\n(forthcoming). \n\nObjection 3: Proper Name Theory leaves no room\nfor dual use and mention (see BQ6).\n \n\nIf quotations were proper names, and if their interiors lacked\nsignificant structure, there would seem to be no room for dual usage of\nthe kind found in (12); indeed, on the Proper Name Theory, (12) has the\nsame interpretive form as (17): \n\nThat is, the Proper Name Theory fails to account for (BQ6). \n\nOther objections have been raised against the Proper Name Theory of\nQuotation. For further discussion, see Davidson (1979), Cappelen and\nLepore (1997b) and Saka (1998). Whether the recent defenders of the\nname theory will be able to take it off its deathbed remains to be\nseen, but it’s fair to say that their work shows that reports of\nits demise have been, at least, a bit premature. \n\nThe Description Theory of Quotation was introduced in order to\nguarantee that ‘a quoted series of expressions is always a series\nof quoted expressions’ (Geach 1957, p. 82) and not ‘a\nsingle long word, whose parts have no separate significance’\n(ibid., p. 82). According to this theory, there is a set of\nbasic units in each language: words, according to Geach\n(ibid., Ch. 18 and 1970); letters, according to Tarski\n(1956, p. 160) and Quine (1960, p. 143, p.\n 212)).[6] \n\nThis view retains the Proper Name Theory for basic quotations, e.g.,\naccording to Quine, “a” is a name of one letter,\n“b” a name of another, etc. For Geach, each word\nhas a quotation name. Complex quotations, i.e., quotations with more\nthan one basic unit, are understood as descriptions of concatenations\nof the basic units. Here is an illustration from Geach (where\n‘-’ is his sign for concatenation): \n\nFor Quine and Tarski, (4) gets analyzed as (18): \n\nwhere ‘-’ is their sign for concatenation and the\nindividual quotations are names of the letters. \n\nDavidson characterizes the difference between the two versions as\nfollows: \nThat is to say, if Geach’s theory were true, the appropriate representation of (4) is simply (4), whereas for Tarski and Quine it’s the much more unwieldy (18). On the other hand, a Geachian language has (at least) twice as many words as we might expect: for each word in the dictionary, there would also be the word that stands for that word (got by enclosing the initial word in quotation marks).\n \n\nIn one respect the Description Theory is an immense improvement over\nthe Proper Name Theory: it deals with no more than a finite set of\nbasic names, thus, potentially accommodating (BQ5). In other respects,\nhowever, the theory is, by a wide consensus, not much of an improvement\nover the Proper Name Theory. At the basic level, the theory still\ntreats quotations as names. So, at that level, it inherits many of the\nproblems confronting the simpler Proper Name Theory. Some of the more obvious objections\nare these (again we mention only some of the most obvious ones\nhere since the theory is not central to contemporary discussions): \n\nThe seminal paper on quotation in the twentieth century is, by almost universal consensus, Davidson’s ‘Quotation’ (1979). It\nis without comparison the most discussed and influential paper on the\nsubject. The view Davidson defends is called the Demonstrative Theory.\n(It is also called the Paratactic Theory, though we shall use the former\nlabel in our discussion.) The Demonstrative Theory is presented in the\nfinal pages of ‘Quotation’ and the key passages\n are\n these:[7] \n…quotation marks…help refer to a shape by pointing out\nsomething that has it…The singular term is the quotation marks,\nwhich may be read ‘the expression a token of which is\nhere’. (Davidson 1979, p. 90) \n\nOn my theory which we may call the demonstrative theory of\nquotation, the inscription inside does not refer to anything at all,\nnor is it part of any expression that does. Rather it is the quotation\nmarks that do all the referring, and they help to refer to a shape by\npointing out something that has it. (Davidson 1979, p. 90) \n\nQuotation marks could be warped so as to remove the quoted material\nfrom a sentence in which they play no semantic role. Thus instead\nof: \n\nwe could write: \n\nThe Demonstrative Theory has three central components. First, the\nquotation marks are treated as contributing a definite description\ncontaining a demonstrative to sentences in which they occur, i.e., the\nquotation marks in (4) become ‘The expression of which this is a\ntoken’, as in (19): Second, in the logical form of a sentence containing a quotation,\nthe token that occurs between the two quotation marks in the surface\nsyntax is discharged, so to speak, from the sentence containing the\nquotation.  What occurs between the quotation marks in the surface\nsyntax is not part of the sentence in which those quotation marks\noccur. It is demonstrated by a use of the quoting sentence. Third, utterances of quotation marks, by virtue of having a\ndemonstrative/indexical ingredient, refer to the expression\ninstantiated by the demonstrated token, i.e., the expression\ninstantiated by the token that in surface syntax sits between the\nquotation marks. \n\nThe Demonstrative Theory is attractive for at least five\nreasons. First, to grasp the function of quotation marks is to acquire\na capacity with infinite applications (BQ5). The Demonstrative Theory\nexplains why: there’s no limit to the kinds of entities we can\ndemonstrate.  Hence, (BQ5) is explained without making quotation a\nproductive device (for elaboration see Cappelen and Lepore\n1997b). \nSecond, opacity is explained (BQ1): There’s no reason to think\nthat two sentences demonstrating different objects will have the same\ntruth-value. (4) and (8) demonstrate different objects, so\nthere’s no more reason to think the move from (4) to (8) is\ntruth preserving than there is to think that the move from (20) to\n(21) is: \nThird, we have an elegant explanation of mixed quotation, i.e., we can\nexplain (BQ6). Davidson says: \n\nThis, according to Davidson, is what goes on in (12). A token that is\nbeing used for one purpose is at the same time demonstrated for\nanother: ‘Any token may serve as target for the arrows of\nquotation, so in particular a quoting sentence may after all by chance\ncontain a token with the shape needed for the purposes of\nquotation’ (Davidson 1979, pp. 90–91; cf., also, Cappelen\nand Lepore 1997b). On this view, (12) is understood as (22).  (Note:\nthe ‘these’ in (22) is accompanied by a pointing or\nindexing to the token of Quine’s words.) Fourth, there is no mystery about how to introduce new vocabulary;\nsince there’s no limit to what can be demonstrated,\nthere’s no limit to what can be quoted. (BQ3) is explained. Finally, quantifying-in is obviously ruled out, since the quoted\ntoken is placed outside the quoting sentence, i.e., the Demonstrative\nTheory can explain (BQ2). \n\nThe Demonstrative Theory is both bold and radical. It triggered an\nentire cottage industry devoted to criticizing and defending it. For\nproponents, see, for example, Partee (1973), Garcia-Carpintero (1994,\n2017, forthcoming), Cappelen and Lepore (1997b), McCullagh (2007),\nPredelli (2008); for critics, see just about anyone else writing on\nquotation after 1979. \n\nIn what follows we present five criticisms of the Demonstrative\nTheory. Needless to say, the list is not exhaustive (e.g., see\nSorensen 2008 and Saka 2011b on the problem of empty quotation),\nand indeed, each objection has triggered lively discussion which space\nlimitations prohibit our taking up here. \n\nObjection 1. If the Demonstrative Theory were\ncorrect, it should be possible for (4) to demonstrate, e.g., a\npenguin.\n\n \n\nHere is an argument that mimics a range of objections raised against\nDavidson’s account of the semantics for indirect reports (Burge\n1986, Stainton\n 1999).[9] \nRecall that according to Davidson the logical form of (4) is\n(19). \n\n(19) contains a demonstrative and demonstratives refer to whatever\nis demonstrated with their use. What is demonstrated on a given\noccasion depends on the speaker (either the demonstration or the\nintention or some combination of the two). It should be possible, then,\nfor a speaker to utter (4) and not demonstrate the exhibited\ntoken of ‘bachelor’. That is to say, if there really is a\ndemonstrative in (19), that demonstrative should have the same kind of\nfreedom that other demonstratives have: it should be able to refer to,\nfor example, a nearby penguin. Of course, no utterance of (4) makes\nreference to a penguin. So the Demonstrative Theory is\n wrong.[10]\n (For replies to this objection see Cappelen and Lepore 1999b.) \n\nObjection 2. The Problem of\nRelevant Features \n\nAccording to Davidson, a quotation refers to an expression indirectly,\nby referring to a token that instantiates that expression.  Davidson\nthinks expressions are shapes or patterns (see\nDavidson 1979, p. 90). A problem for this view is that any one token\ninstantiates indefinitely many distinct shapes or patterns, i.e.  many\ndifferent expressions. So how, on Davidson’s view, do we get from a\nparticular token to a unique type, i.e., from a token to an\nexpression? \n\nJonathan Bennett formulates the problem as follows: \n\nA related worry is this: Read (4) out loud. It seems obvious that a\nspoken utterance says (makes) the same claim as a written utterance of\n(4). On the Demonstrative Theory it is unclear why this should be so:\nthe spoken utterance demonstrates a vocal pattern, and the written\nutterance a graphemic pattern. They seem to be attributing properties\nto different objects. (Several suggestions are on offer for how to\namend the Demonstrative Theory in this respect: cf., Garcia-Carpintero\n1994, Cappelen and Lepore 1997b, 1999c, and Davidson 1999.) \n\nObjection 3. The Problem of Missing Quotation\nMarks\n \n\nAccording to Davidson, quotation marks are what are used to do the\nreferring. They are descriptions containing demonstratives whose uses\nrefer to whatever pattern is instantiated by the demonstrated token.\nThis makes the presence of quotation marks essential. Much recent work\non quotation argues that we can quote (or do something quote-like)\nwithout quotation marks and that a theory of quotation should\nbe capable of explaining how quotation can take place in the absence of\nquotation marks. Here is Reimer’s version of this objection: Consider the following sentence: \n\nHere, we have a case in which an expression is quoted—not by means\nof quotation marks—but by means of italicization. But surely it would\nbe absurd to suppose (consistently with Davidson’s view) that the\nitalicization of (7)’s subject term is itself a demonstrative\nexpression! (Reimer 1996, p. 135) \n\nThe same idea is expressed by Washington (1992): \n\nThe Demonstrative Theory depends on the presence of quotation marks\n(inasmuch as they are what get used to do the referring), so if\nquotation can occur without quotation marks (as in the Reimer and\nWashington cases), it’s hard to see how the Demonstrative Theory is\nadequate. \n\nProponents have been unimpressed. Consider an utterance of (6): Several possible replies can be made by proponents of the\nDemonstrative Theory.  One thing a Demonstrative Theorist might say is\nthat there are no missing quotation marks in (6): they are in the\nlogical form of the sentence, not in its surface syntax. Alternatively, quotation marks for an utterance of (6) could be\ngenerated as conversational or conventional implicatures. (He\ncan’t be saying that Donald, the person, is his name as he knows\nthat that is false, so he must be conversationally implicating that\nthe expression of which he used a token is a name\n(cf. Garcia-Carpintero 1994, pp. 262–63)). Or by an appeal to the\ndistinction between semantic reference and speaker reference. (6) is\ngrammatically correct but false; nonetheless, someone can succeed in\ncommunicating something true about Donald’s name if he succeeds\nin conveying to his audience his intention to refer to it (cf.,\nGomez-Torrente 2001). Finally, a Demonstrative Theorist can argue that these other\nquotation-like phenomena are just that—quotation-like. They\nrequire a separate treatment. There’s no need for a unified\ntheory (cf., Cappelen and Lepore 2003). \n\nObjection 4. The Problem of Iteration \n\nThe Demonstrative Theory seems to have difficulty dealing with\niterated quotation. (24) refers to the quotation in (23): \n\nThe Demonstrative Theory’s account for (23) is (25). \n\nHow, then, can the account accommodate (24)? (24), after all, includes\ntwo sets of quotation marks. It might seem like the\nDemonstrative Theory would have to treat it as the ungrammatical (26)\nor the unintelligible (27). \n\nThis objection has been raised by Saka (1998, pp. 119–20), Reimer\n(1996), and Washington (1992). \n\nIn response, Demonstrative Theorists insist that quotations are not\niterative. Cappelen and Lepore write: \n\nFor further discussion of whether quotation is a genuinely iterative\ndevice, see Cappelen and Lepore (1999a) and Saka (2013). \n\nObjection 5. The Problem of Open Quotation:\nDangling Singular Terms\n\n \n\nRecanati (2001) focuses on cases where quoted expressions do not\nserve as noun phrases in sentences. He has in mind cases like (29) and\n(30): \n\nIn these cases it looks like the Demonstrative Theory would have to\npostulate a dangling singular term, something like (31) or (32): \n\nIn response to the idea that (29) is elliptical for (33), \n\nRecanati says: \n\nLess baroque than the Demonstrative Theory, the Disquotational Theory\nis probably the simplest, most natural and obvious account of\nquotation. It is endorsed by a wide range of authors, often in passing,\nas if completely obvious. A simple version of it can be found in\nRichard’s Disquotational Schema (DQR): \n\nDQR: For any expression e, the left quote (lq) followed by e\nfollowed by the right quote (rq) denotes e (Richard 1986, p. 397)\n\n \n\nLudwig and Ray write: \n\nwhere the ‘┌’ and\n‘┐’ are the left and right corner\nquotes. (See also Smullyan 1957, Mates 1972, p. 21; Wallace 1972,\np. 237; Salmon 1986, p. 6, Gomez-Torrente 2001, Botteral and Stainton\n2005. A nearby view is the minimalism of Cappelen and Lepore 2007;\ndiscussion of it can be found in Garcia-Carpintero 2011.) \n\nOn this account, quotations are not proper names, or descriptions or\ndemonstratives but rather they are functors that take an expression as\ntheir argument and return it as value. \n\nThe two most obvious strengths of the Disquotational Theory are its\nsimplicity and intuitiveness. If asked how quotation functions, the\nobvious reply is something along the lines of (DQR). It is also an\naxiom (or axiom schema) that’s pleasingly simple and requires no\ncomplicated assumptions about the surface structure of the sentence\n(in this respect, it has a clear edge on the Demonstrative Theory). \n\nIn addition to be being exceedingly simple and intuitive, this\ntheory easily accounts for three of the Basic Facts about\nQuotation. \nFirst, it explains opacity: ‘bachelor’ and\n‘unmarried man’ have different semantic values because\nwhat is between the quotation marks are distinct expressions. An\nexpression’s semantic value is irrelevant for determining the\nsemantic value of the quotation of that expression, thus accounting\nfor (BQ1). Second, since quotations are functor expressions without internal\nstructure, (BQ2) is explained: there’s no possibility of\nquantifying into a quotation on this view. Finally, since quotations, as functors, map all expressions onto themselves,\nthis account can explain the special relationship between a quotation\nand the quoted expression—namely, identity—thus explaining\n(BQ4). \n\nEven with these advantages, at least three serious difficulties\nconfront the Disquotational Theory. \n\n(DQR) says we can take any expression e, put quotation\nmarks around e, and what results is an expression that refers to e. What\nexactly is meant by ‘any expression’ in (DQR)? Richard\noffers the following answer: \n\nIf this is how expressions are generated, how then are we to account\nfor the truth of (9) and (10)? More generally, the worry is this: (DQR)\nneeds to specify, in some manner or other, the domain of expressions over\nwhich it quantifies. How can it do this without unreasonably limiting\nthe kinds of symbols that can be\n quoted?[11]\n (See Lepore (1999) for elaboration on this point.) Second, according to (BQ6), a theory of quotation should leave room for\ndual use and mention. It is hard to see how (DQR) leaves such room. If\nquotes are referring expressions (as they are according to DQR), then\nif we let ‘Ted’ name the expression ‘has a certain\nanomalous feature’, (12) should say the same as, express the\nsame proposition as, (17). Not only should (12) and (17) express the same proposition, according\nto DQR, they should also have the same logical form. That’s an\nobviously incorrect account of (12). (For further discussion of mixed\nquotation \n see Section 4 below.) \nFinally, those who raise Objection 4 against the Demonstrative Theory would\nprobably raise the same objection here: the Disquotational Theory\nfails to account for quotation without quotation marks. All the work\nis being done by quotation marks, so there’s no room for quotation\nwithout quotation marks. (DQR) proponents would presumably be as\nunimpressed as Demonstrative Theorists and their replies would be much\nthe same (see above). \n\nThe label ‘the Identity Theory of Quotation’ was first\nused, as far as we know, by Washington (1992), though he attributes the\nview to Frege (1892) and Searle (1969). However, the passages in which\nthis view was allegedly offered prior to Washington hardly count as\npresenting a theory; they read more like dogmatic pronouncements devoid\nof argumentation. Since Washington’s paper was published related views have been developed in more detail by Saka (1998, 2004, 2011a), Reimer (1996),\nRecanati (2000, 2001) and others. \n\nWashington’s presentation of the Identity Theory is somewhat\ncompressed—the key passage is this: \n\nThere are three important components of this\n view:[12],[13] \n\nOne way to get a handle on this kind of view is to consider a spoken\nutterance of (6) \n\nAccording to the Use/Identity theory, (6), when spoken, is grammatical\n(Washington 1992, pp. 588–90). There are no missing (or implicit)\nquotation marks. When uttered by a person whose name is\n‘Donald’ it is true (if ‘Donald’ is used\nquotationally). The function of quotation marks in written language is\nsimply to indicate that words are being used in this special,\nquotational, way, i.e. not (only) with their regular extensions. In\nother words, ‘Donald’ can be used in two different ways:\nwith its usual semantic value (its regular referent) or\nquotationally. In the latter case, its semantic value is an\nexpression. We wish that the Identity Theory were not called ‘the\nIdentity Theory’. (In private communication, Washington has\nexpressed the same sentiment.) The ‘identity’ component is\npicked up from the formulation, ‘a quoted expression is related\nto its value by identity: a quoted expression mentions itself’.\nThis formulation, however, is deeply misleading, since according to both Washington (and later,\nfor example, Saka (1998)), quotations are ambiguous. They can,\naccording to Washington, refer to types, tokens, or shapes (see\nWashington 1992, p. 594) and according to another proponent of this\nkind of view, Saka, they are even more flexible (Saka 1998, see\nfurther presentation of Saka’s view below). A better label would be\n‘the Use-Theory of Quotation’, since this emphasizes the\npoint that a proper understanding of quotation requires appealing to a\nspecial way of using language. In what follows, we use the ungainly\ncompromise ‘the Use/Identity Theory’. \n\nIt is useful to contrast Washington’s account with the\nDisquotational Theory. Recall, that, according to DQR, quotation\nmarks have a semantic function and that function is spelled out in\nthe disquotational schema (DQR). (DQR) is a semantic axiom. It treats\nquotation marks as identity functions. Speakers’ intentions figure not\nat all in this axiom (other than the intention to speak English). There\nis no need, on the Disquotational Theory, to appeal to a special kind\nof quotational usage. For Washington, the quotation marks have no\ngenuine semantic function. They are no more than a heuristic device for\nindicating that expressions are used in a special way, i.e.\nquotationally. \n\nSeveral recent views share important components of Washington’s. Reimer\n(2003) combines versions of the Demonstrative Theory and the Identity\nTheory. Recanati (2000, 2001, 2010) doesn’t explicitly discuss any\nversion of the Identity Theory, but his theory incorporates some of its\ncomponents; it is distinctive by focusing on what he calls ‘Open\nQuotation’ (see Objection 5 to the Demonstrative Theory above)\nand the iconic aspects of quotation (see Recanati 2001 for\nelaboration). Two theories might be worth a closer look for those\ninterested in exploring Use/Identity Theories further (the second of\nthese is mostly of historical interest). \nFirst, Saka (1998, 1999, 2003) has developed a theory that has\nmuch in common with Washington’s (though it also differs in important\nrespects). He agrees with Washington in emphasizing ‘quotational\nuse’ (Saka calls it ‘mentioning’), but Saka has more\nto say about mentioning than Washington has to say about quotational\nuse (see Saka 1998 and 2003). Saka also goes further than\nWashington in claiming that quotation marks are not required for\nmentioning even in written language. (For Washington, it is only in\nspoken language that we can quote without quotation marks). According\nto Saka, (34) ‘is a grammatical and true sentence’ (Saka 1998, p.118.) \n\nEven though Saka agrees with Washington that quotation marks\n‘announce ‘I am not (merely) using expression X;\nI am also mentioning it’’ (Saka 1998, p. 127), he\ndiffers from Washington in that he assigns them a genuine syntactic\nand semantic function (Saka, 1998, p. 128). In this respect he\nincorporates components of what we above called the Disquotational\nTheory.[14],[15] \n\nSaka’s account also differs from Washington’s in that he emphasizes\nthat quotations are ambiguous (or indeterminate) and that what they\nrefer to depends on the speaker’s intentions (see Saka 1998, pp.\n123–4). For further discussion of this point, \n see Section 5 below. Second, there is one view we have not discussed and which might\n(admittedly with some difficulty) be squeezed into the category of the\nUse/Identity Theory. Quine said a number of things about quotation; in\none passage he writes: \nDavidson (1979), taking his cue from this passage and others, baptized\nthe view intimated in Quine’s passage as ‘the Picture Theory of\nQuotation’ (cf., also, Christensen 1967, p. 362). As Davidson\nnotes, on this view: \n\nNotice that according to Davidson’s description of this view, the\nquotation marks per se have no semantic function; rather,\nthey indicate that the words are being used in a special way. They are\nbeing used ‘autonymously’, that is, to name\nthemselves.  So understood, the Picture Theory has at least\nthis much in common with a Use/Identity Theory: they agree that\nquotation marks are inessential; they only indicate a special\nuse. They indicate that expressions are being used as a picture (or as\na hieroglyph). The Picture Theory—if it’s even appropriate\nto call it a theory—is never elaborated in any great detail and\nwe suspect that if it were, it would become obvious that it is a\nversion of the Use/Identity Theory. \n\nUse/Identity Theorists claim that their theories are explanatorily\nmore powerful than traditional semantic theories. By seeing quotation\nmarks as a parasitic phenomenon, they are able to explain the semantics\nof both quotation and this more general phenomenon in a unified\nway. \n\nThere’s a great deal of specific data that these theories claim to be\nable to explain. The most important of these is the possibility of\nmentioning without quotation marks (as in spoken language and in\nwritten language when no quotation marks are used). If we take\nappearances at face value, that means meta-linguistic discourse (call\nit mentioning or quotational use) can take place in the absence of\nquotation marks. Hence, an account of meta-linguistic discourse must\nproceed independently of an account of the semantics (or pragmatics)\nfor quotation marks. \n\nThe following are additional claims made on behalf of the\nUse/Identity Theory (we take it to be an open question at this point\nwhether these points are sustainable): \n\nDiscussion of the Use/Identity Theories is not yet as extensive as\ndiscussion of the Demonstrative Theory, so there are fewer objections\nto report. We discuss four concerns that have surfaced in various\ndiscussions. \n\nQuestion about the Relevance of Quotational Use/Mention:\nUse/Identity Theories put a great deal of weight on the idea that the\nsemantics for quotation cannot be developed without an account of\nquotational usage (mention in Saka’s terminology.) There\nare several reasons for doubting this, two of which are these: \n\nQuestion about the Semantics-Pragmatics Divide: On the\nUse/Identity Theory, a lot of work is done by pragmatic mechanisms.\nThe appeal to speaker intentions plays a central role on all levels of\nanalysis. On Saka’s view, for example, what a quoted expression refers\nto is largely up to the speaker’s intentions (and, maybe, what’s\nsalient in the context of utterance). A consequence of this view is\nthat there is no guarantee, for example, that an utterance of (35) or\n(36) will be true: \n\nThe two ‘a’s in (35) could refer to different\nobjects; the “run” in (36) might refer to, for example, a\nconcept (see Cappelen and Lepore 1999b and Saka 1999, 2003, 2011). \n\nOver-generation Problems: According to Use/Identity Theories,\nyou can do a lot with quotation. The question is whether this results\nin such theories running into problems of over-generation.  Take, for\nexample, Saka’s claim that a quotation refers to an item\nassociated with the expression. There’s only one restriction:\nThis item cannot be the expression’s regular extension. If this is the\nsole restriction on what quotations can be used to refer to,\nwe should be able to do things with quotation that there’s no evidence\nthat we can. It could, for example, be the case that in a particular\ncontext, the (regular) extension of ‘love’, call it\nlove, was associated with the expression ‘money’;\nmaybe, for some reason, that association was contextually salient.\nNonetheless, (37) cannot be used to say that love plays a\ncentral role in many peoples’ lives. \n\nUse/Identity Theories have to explain what blocks such readings (or\nshow that they are possible). (See Saka 2003, and Cappelen and Lepore\n2003.) \n\nDual Use-Mention (BQ6): Washington says that quotation marks\nindicate quotational usage and that expressions used quotationally\nrefer to themselves (or some related entity). If so, the logical form\nof (12) should be that of (17), clearly not a correct result. \n\nIt is at least a challenge to Identity/Use theorists to explain how\nthe theory can accommodate simultaneous use and mention. \n\nIn addition to the above points, there’s a lively debate about\nthe specifics of identity/use theories. For discussions of Saka, see\nCappelen and Lepore (2003), Reimer (2003), and for discussions of\nRecanati, see Cappelen and Lepore (2003), Reimer (2003), Benbaji\n(2003, 2004a, 2004b), and Cumming (2003). \n\nWe now turn from discussions of large-scale theories of quotation to\ndiscussions of how to understand specific aspects of our quotational\npractice. Two issues have been particularly important in the recent\ndiscussions: Mixed Quotation and the alleged ambiguity of quotations.\nOne’s view of these issues has wide reaching implications for which\ntheory of quotation one favors. We discuss these in turn. From around the millennium, beginning with Cappelen and\nLepore’s 1997a, which made the topic mainstream, mixed quotation\nhas been, arguably, the area in which theorizing about quotation has\nadvanced the most. The problem has attracted the attention of both\nphilosophers and linguists, and our understanding of both the data to\nbe accounted for, and the various possibilities for doing so, has been\ngreatly improved. It’s important to reiterate our above note that here as\nelsewhere in the theory of quotation what comprises the phenomenon is\nup for debate; different theorists emphasise or play down different\nbits of data. What follows, accordingly, doesn’t represent a\nconsensus position on the problem, simply because there is none\n(indeed, somewhat unfortunately, there isn’t even consensus\nabout the terminology, some calling it ‘hybrid’ or ‘impure’, and some\nsubsuming mixed quotation under ‘scare quoting’; De Brabanter 2010 is\nhelpful here, as well as being a useful survey of the field from a\nlinguist’s point of view). We will simply present some of the\nmore interesting and central data points and problems for a theory of\nmixed quotation (for the theories themselves, we refer the reader to\nMaier’s (2017) overview article which presents some of the main\nformal semantic theories out there. For recent theories by\nphilosophers on mixed quotation, see Gomez-Torrente 2005, Kirk and\nLudwig 2017, McCullagh 2007, 2017. The main linguists to consult are\ncited in this section.) The paradigm example of mixed quotation is the following, repeated: \nIt is mostly agreed that this sentence puts forward the following\nclaim: Quine said (expressed the proposition or content) that\nquotation has an anomalous feature, and did so by uttering the\nexpression ‘has an anomalous feature’. This suggests two\ninitial requirements: \nLet’s call these the use requirement and\nthe mention requirement, respectively. \nWhile these both seem clearly on the right lines (if you doubt this,\nopen or scroll to a newspaper and read until you find the first mixed\nquotation (it shouldn’t take long) and see if the requirements\nare operative) there are problems with both of them. It might\ninitially seem that the mention requirement requires that the reportee\nhave uttered verbatim the words ascribed to him or her. That would\naccount for the anomalousness of:\n \nThings aren’t so clear, though. Certain other pieces of data are in tension with this purported feature of the mention requirement, most notably that one can mixed quote someone correctly in a language other than the one they spoke (Cappelen and Lepore 2007 p. 44). Thus the following, as well as its parenthesised continuation, is fine: \nMoreover, more subtle problems for the use requirement come from\ninflected languages (Shan 2010, Maier 2014a). Thus in Italian, nouns\nmust agree in gender and number with adjectives. Imagine Ken says: \nThis means ‘I find Italian men very cute’, and since the\nnoun ‘uomini’ (men) is m.pl, so is the adjective\n‘carini’ (cute). But if one wanted to mixed quote Ken,\nusing a different word than ‘uomini’, that different word\nwould have to agree: \nSo the mixed quoted material used to report Ken’s utterance is not what he said verbatim: he said ‘carini’ and he is reported as saying ‘carine’ (the example is from Shan 2010). Maier presents similar cases for Dutch. Yet a third problem comes from the fact that one can ‘clean up’ quotations, by removing grammatical slurs, umms and ahhs, and so on (see Cappelen and Lepore 2007 p. 45).\n \nWhat exactly the mention requirement requires is uncertain, then. But\nnor, however, is the use requirement without its problems. There are\nat least two, which again differ in subtlety. From the beginning,\nit’s been realised that indexicals in mixed quotations cause\nintriguing problems. Consider: \nIf the second mixed quotation were simply being used, then the second\nsentence should be true provided accord was a surprise to the people\nwriting the report, not to Greenspan and Reich. That’s clearly\nthe wrong result, and shows that the use requirement needs some\nmodifiction (for discussion about indexicals in mixed quotation, and\nwhether they call for Kaplanian monstrous operators, see also Recanati\n(2001), Cumming (2003), Geurts and Maier (2003), and Maier\n(2016)). \nThe behaviour of indexicals in mixed quotation is important, because\nit gives strong evidence against the possibility that mixed quotation\nis a pragmatic phenomenon. A typical pragmatic analysis would say that\nthe semantic contribution of the quoted material in a mixed quotation\nis just its unquoted semantic value (so that the literal semantic\ncontent of (12) is simply ‘Quine said that quotation has a\ncertain anomalous feature’), but that to utter a mixed quotation\nis to imply, but not to say, that the quoted material was used by the\nspeaker to say what they said. The advantages of a pragmatic analysis of mixed quotation are those\ntypical of pragmatic analyses in general: no extra semantic machinery\nis required to account for the problem cases. As such, versions of\nsuch an analysis have had many adherents at the end of the twentieth\ncentury (see, for example, Recanati (2001), Clark & Gerrig (1990),\nWilson (2000), Sperber & Wilson (1981), Tsohatzidis (1998),\nStaintion (1999), Saka (2003) and the discussion in by Reimer\n(2003)). However, the behaviour of indexicals in mixed quotation make the\npragmatic analysis harder to uphold. One needs to say that (42) is\nliterally false, and while that is a move that can be made, it’s\nnot particularly attractive, and so the pragmatic analysis has gone\nsomewhat out of fashion, and has been argued against explicitly\nexplicitly by Gomez-Torrente (2017), and implicitly by most of the\nlinguists working in the field, who view the behaviour of indexicals\nas a key explanandum of a theory of mixed quotation, and not something\nto be explained away. \nThe second, more subtle, problem is a consequence of the fact that one\ncan mixed quote an expression belonging to a dialect other than the\none one speaks, or even to no dialect at all (Shan 2010). Thus even in\ninformal British English, ‘accident’ always takes the\npreposition ‘by’ and never ‘on’. A British\nspeaker can draw attention to this fact, by uttering, about an\nAmerican friend of theirs: \nBut a British speaker can’t felicitiously use ‘on\naccident’ because that’s not a part of British English speakers'\ndialect. Similarly, ‘misunderestimated’ isn’t a word\nin most anybody’s dialects, but we can say: \nA different, more fundamental, source of complication arises from the\nfact that it’s unclear exactly how much to include under mixed\nquotation. Thus consider: \nShould we include such phenomena in our theory of mixed quotation? The\nfirst sentence doesn’t contain a speech verb, while the second\ndoes, but the person to whom the mixed quotation is attributed\nisn’t the person who uttered the mixed quoted words. It’s\nunclear. Things get even more uncertain when we consider scare quotes\n(Predelli 2003a,b, Saka 2013, Gomez-Torrente 2017) and what are known\neuphemistically as grocers’ quotes: \nIn the former case, there isn’t any one person who used\n‘sexting’; rather, the writer is marking that it’s\nused in a community which they are not part of or disapprove of. In\nthe latter case, the quotation marks are serving as emphasis. While we\nprobably don’t want to spend a lot of time seriously theorizing\nabout grocers’ quotes (although see Abbott 2003), whether or not\nscare quotes should be treated as we treat mixed quotation (indeed,\nwhether or not they’re one and the same) is an open question\n(see McCullagh 2017 for discussion and an affirmative answer to these\nquestions; Gomez-Torrente 2017 demurs). \nThis isn’t even an exhaustive characterization. Thus it’s\nimportant to attend to cognate phenomena like dequotation (Shan 2010)\nand free indirect discourse (Maier 2015, 2017). And the theorist of\nmixed quotation should at least be aware of the problem of mixed\nquoting non-constituent clauses (Abbott 2003), and the possibility\nthat one can mixed quote without quotation marks (De Brabanter\n2010). The complexity of the data has inspired much interesting\ntheorizing, and we expect that mixed quotation will continue to be a\nfocal question in the theory of quotation.  \n\nRunning parallel to the debate about how quotations refer\n(how they manage to hook up with their semantic values) is a debate\nabout what quotations refer to. One view that is widespread\nis that quotations are ambiguous or indeterminate. That is, one and\nthe same quotation, e.g. “lobster” can, on this view,\nrefer to different objects on different occasions of use, all\ndepending on the context of utterance. Garcia-Carpintero (1994,\np. 261) illustrates this kind of view and the kind of argument\ntypically given for it. He says that “gone” can refer to\nany of the following: \n\nOthers think quotation can pick out contents or concepts. Goldstein\nsays: \n\nSaka (1998, p. 124) concurs and claims that “premise” and\n“premiss” in (38) pick out concepts: \n\nTsohatzidis (1998) claims that since T1 is true, even though Descartes\ndidn’t speak English, “is a thinking substance” in T1\ncan’t refer to an English expression. \n\n(T1) In one of the greatest philosophy books ever written in Latin,\nDescartes said that man ‘is a thinking substance’. \n\nThese arguments all take the same form: first, they identify a\nsentence S that we are inclined to interpret as true and\nsuggest that the only way to understand how S can be true is\nto assume that quotations can refer to some kind of object\nO. This is then alleged to be evidence that quotations can be\nused to refer to objects of kind O. \n\nIf quotation has this kind of flexibility, the five theories\ndiscussed above will all have to be evaluated with respect to whether\nthey can accommodate it. The Proper Name Theory, Description theory,\nand Disquotational Theory, all seem to have particular difficulties in\nthis respect. \n\nNot all, however, are convinced that quotations are flexible in just\nthis way. Some have expressed skepticism both about the form of\nargument (see Cappelen and Lepore 1999a) and about the specific\nexamples. Cappelen and Lepore (1999a) also argue that the multiple\nambiguity view over-generates, i.e., it predicts that it is possible to\nexpress propositions with quotation sentences that it is not possible\nto express with such sentences. For further discussion, see also Saka\n(2003). \n\nA number of authors over the years have thought that our standard\npractices of quotation are not suitable for all purposes and have, in\neffect, introduced new technical devices. They cannot all be summarized\nhere, but here is a brief sketch of some such devices. \n\nReichenbach (1947, p. 284) writes: ‘Whereas the\nordinary-quotes operation leads from a word to the name of that word,\nthe token-quotes operation leads from a token to a token denoted by that\ntoken’. Reichenbach uses little arrows (\\(\\tokenquote{\\,}\\))\nfor token quotes, so that the sign (39): \n\nrepresents not a name for the token of ‘a’, but a token\nfor it. That is, the token in (39) cannot be repeated. (40), for\nexample, is not only a token different from (39) but refers to a\ndifferent token (Reichenbach 1947, pp. 285–86). \n\nToken quotes then are much like writing a demonstrative expression\nlike ‘this’ and fastening to it an object to produce a\nsymbol of that object. (As noted above, some authors (Bennett 1988,\nSaka 1998, Washington 1992) opine that this is how ordinary\nquotation sometimes functions.) \n\nAs Quine (1940, §6) notes, the quotation: \n\ndesignates only the specific expression therein depicted, containing a\nspecific Greek letter. In order to effect reference to the unspecified\nexpression he introduces a new notation of corners (namely,\n‘┌’ and\n‘┐’). So, for example, if we take the\nexpression ‘Quine’ as μ, then\n┌(μ)┐ is\n‘(Quine)’. The quasi-quotation is synonymous with the\nfollowing verbal description: The result of writing ‘(’\nand then μ and ‘)’ (Quine 1940, p. 36). For an\ninteresting suggestion about quasi-quotation in natural language, see\nSaka (2017). \n\nSomeone who uses the word ‘red’ in speaking or thinking\nwould generally be held to be employing the same concept as a French\nperson who uses ‘rouge’. Assuming that ‘rouge’\nis a good translation of ‘red’, Sellars (1963) thought it\nconvenient to have a general term by which to classify words that are\nfunctional counterparts in this way. Such a term is provided by\nSellars’ dot quotes. Dot-quotes form a common noun true of items in\nany language that play the role performed in our language by the\ntokens exhibited between them, so any expression that is a functional\ncounterpart to ‘red’ can be described as a\n·red·. In Sellars’ terminology,\nthe concept red is something that is common and peculiar to\n·red·s. Consider (41): Michael Ernst claims this sentence is ambiguous. Read one way, (41)\nmeans that the concatenation of the first letter of the Roman alphabet\nwith the second letter is an expression; read another way it means\nthat the expression between the two outer quote marks is an\nexpression.  Confronted with this ambiguity, Boolos (1995) introduced\na notation for quotation in which every quotation mark ‘knows\nits mate’.  So understood there are denumerably many distinct\nquotation marks, each formed by prefixing a natural number n of\nstrokes to a small circle, and in order to meaningfully enclose an\nexpression with Boolos quotation marks we have to choose quotation\nmarks of a ‘higher order’ than the quotation marks that\noccur in the expression to be quoted (if there are any) and each\nquotation mark in a grammatical sentence is to be ‘paired’\nwith the next identical quotation mark (Boolos 1995,\np. 291). Accordingly, reading (41) as containing Boolos quotation\nmarks, we get the more natural reading according to which it says that\nthe first letter of the Roman alphabet concatenated with the second is\nan expression. \n\nCarnap introduced in Logical Syntax of Language (1937) a\ndistinction between formal and material modes. The material mode is\ngenerally used to describe the non-linguistic world; the formal mode\nis generally used to discuss the language that is used to describe the\nmaterial world. Thus ‘one is a number’ is a sentence in\nmaterial mode; and ‘‘one’ is a number\nword’ is its sentential counterpart in formal mode. This\ndistinction is mentioned in passing here since some authors have\nthought it corresponds to the use/mention distinction. Since the\nuse/mention distinction isn’t particularly about quotation, there\nisn’t much that needs to be said about the material/formal mode here\neither.  Revealing that a statement is basically about the use of\nlanguage may succeed in removing some of its metaphysical mystery. And\nit may even be that semantic ascent (that is, the device of making a\nsentence the topic, instead of what the sentence purports to refer to)\nsucceeds in demystifying much of what goes on in certain quarters of\nphilosophy. But as we’ve said, this distinction, and the various\nphilosophical moves surrounding it, doesn’t have much to do with\nquotation per se.","contact.mail":"h.w.cappelen@ifikk.uio.no","contact.domain":"ifikk.uio.no"},{"date.published":"2005-07-16","date.changed":"2019-02-08","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quotation/","author1":"Herman Cappelen","author2":"Matthew McKeever","author1.info":"http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/faculty/lepore.html","entry":"quotation","body.text":"\n\n\n\nStarting with Frege, the semantics (and pragmatics) of quotation has\nreceived a steady flow of attention over the last one hundred or so\nyears. It has not, however, been subject to the same kind of intense\ndebate and scrutiny as, for example, the semantics of definite\ndescriptions or of propositional attitude verbs. Many\nphilosophers probably share Davidson’s experience: ‘When I was\ninitiated into the mysteries of logic and semantics, quotation was\nusually introduced as a somewhat shady device, and the introduction\nwas accompanied by a stern sermon on the sin of confusing the use and\nmention of expressions’ (Davidson 1979, p. 79). Those who leave\nit at that, however, miss out on one of the most difficult and\ninteresting topics in the philosophy of language.\n\nConsider the following \n sentences:[1]\n\n(1)\n\n‘Snow is white’ is true in English iff snow is white.\n\n\n(2)\n\n‘Aristotle’ refers to Aristotle.\n\n\n(3)\n\n‘The’ is the definite article in English.\n\n\n(4)\n\n‘Bachelor’ has eight letters.\n\n\nQuotation interests philosophers and linguists for various reasons,\nincluding these:\n\nWhen language is used to attribute properties to language or\notherwise theorize about it, a linguistic device is needed that\n‘turns language on itself’. Quotation is one such device.\nIt is our primary meta-linguistic tool and if you don’t\nunderstand quotation, then you can’t understand sentences like\n(1)–(4). Those who are in the business of theorizing about\nlanguage are particularly interested in understanding the mechanisms\nthat render (1)–(4) intelligible.\n\nTheories of quotation address questions not just about\nhow quotations refer, but also about what they refer\nto. In this regard, theories of quotation tell us what we are talking\nabout in (1)–(4).\n\nQuotation is a paradigmatic opaque context, i.e. a context in\nwhich substitution of synonymous or co-referential expressions can fail\nto preserve truth-value. To understand the nature of opacity you must\nunderstand how quotation functions.\n\nQuotation is a device for talking about language, but it does so\nin a particularly tricky way: somehow quotation manages to use its\nreferent to do (or at least to participate in) the referring. Putting\nquotation marks around a word creates a device that refers to that\nvery word: ‘‘Aristotle’’ refers to\n‘Aristotle’. As such, quotation is a particularly\ninteresting referential device.\n\nAs with all issues in the philosophy of language, theories of\nquotation harbor assumptions about how best to draw the distinction\nbetween semantics and pragmatics, and they do so in a particularly\nilluminating way.\n\nAccounting for quotation presents some interesting technical\nchallenges in formal semantics, attempting to resolve which can shed\nlight on our understanding of such fundamental notions as\nindexicality, monstrosity, and compositionality.\nThe entry is structured as follows:\n\n\n\nProblems arise right at the outset since quotation is not an easy\nthing to characterize. We start with reflections on how one might try to do so. \n\nThere’s an easy and relatively non-controversial way to\nidentify quotation: it is the sort of linguistic\nphenomenon exemplified by the subject in (4) and the direct\n object[2]\n in (5); these are instances of pure and direct\nquotation, respectively. \n\nThat leaves open the question of which semantic and syntactic devices\nbelong to that sort. Any characterization of a more specific nature,\neither of a syntactic or a semantic sort, moves into controversial\nterritory immediately. \n\nA syntactic characterization might go something like this:\nTake two quotation marks— single apostrophes in Britain,\ndouble in the United States, double angles in parts of Europe —\nand put, for example, a letter, a word, or a sentence between the two.\nWhat results is a quotation, as in (4)–(5). But then consider\nthe following sentences: \nWe can see there are two problems with the syntactic\ncharacterization: \n\nOther devices employed as substitutes for quotation marks include bold\nface, indentation, and line indentation (cf. Quine 1940, pp. 23–24;\nGeach 1957, p. 82). There’s no clear limit on the range of distinct\nwritten options, other than that they are used as quotation marks, but\nthis renders the syntactic characterization incomplete, and thus,\nunsatisfactory. \n\nAnother tempting strategy is to say that an expression is quoted if\nit is mentioned. There are two problems with this\ncharacterization. \n\nIn order to remain as neutral as possible, we will stick with a\nsimple identification-through-examples strategy, and emphasize that it\nis an open question as to how to identify the sort of linguistic\ndevices to which the subject in (4) belongs. \n\nQuotation is a subject matter that brings together a rather\nspectacular array of linguistic and semantic issues. Here are six basic\nquotational features of particular importance (BQ1–BQ6, for short) that\nwill guide our search for an adequate account: \n\nBQ1. In quotation you cannot substitute\nco-referential or synonymous terms salva veritate.\n \nAn inference from (4) to (8), for example, fails to preserve\ntruth-value. \n\nNo theory of quotation is adequate unless it explains this feature\n(and no theory of opacity is complete before it explains why quotation\nhas this feature). \n\nBQ2. It is not possible to quantify into\nquotation. \n\n(9), for example, does not follow from (4): \n\nAn adequate theory of quotation must explain why not. The product of\nquoting ‘x’ is an expression that refers to the\n24th letter of the Roman alphabet. The point is that\nquotation marks, at least in natural language, cannot be quantified\ninto because they trap the variable; what results is a quotation that\nrefers to that very variable. \n\nBQ3. Quotation can be used to introduce novel\nwords, symbols and alphabets; it is not limited to the extant lexicon\nof any one language. Both (10) and (11) are true English sentences: \n\nAn adequate theory of quotation must explain what makes this\npractice possible. \n\nBQ4. There’s a particularly close relationship\nbetween quotations and their semantic values. \n\n“lobsters” and its semantic value are more intimately\nrelated than ‘lobster’ and its semantic value, i.e., the\nrelationship between “lobster” and ‘lobster’\nis closer than that which obtains between ‘lobsters’ and\nlobsters. Whereas the quotation (i.e., “lobster”), in some\nway to be further explained, has its referent (i.e.,\n‘lobster’) contained in it, the semantic value of\n‘lobsters’, i.e., lobsters, are not contained in\n‘lobster’. One way to put it is that an expression e is\nin the quotation of e. No matter how one chooses to spell\nthis out, any theory of quotation must explain this relationship. \n\nBQ5. To understand quotation is to have an\ninfinite capacity, a capacity to understand and generate a potential\ninfinity of new quotations. \n\nWe don’t learn quotations one by one. Never having encountered the\nquotation in (10) or (11) does nothing to prohibit comprehending them\n(Christensen 1967, p. 362) and identifying their semantic values. \n\nSimilarly, there doesn’t seem to be any upper bound on a\nspeaker’s ability to generate novel quotations. One natural\nexplanation for this is that quotation is a productive device\nin natural language. \n\nBQ6. Quoted words can be simultaneously used\nand mentioned. \n\n(12) is called a ‘mixed quotation’. This is because it\nmixes the direct quotation (as in (5)) and indirect (as in (13)). \n\nIn this regard, the quotation in (12) is, in an intuitive sense,\nsimultaneously used and mentioned. It is used to say what Quine said\n(viz. that quotation has a certain anomalous feature), and\nalso to say that Quine used the words ‘has a certain anomalous\nfeature’ in saying it. \n\nMixed quotation had not been much discussed prior to Davidson (1979)\nbut it has recently taken center stage in discussions of theories of\nquotation. For those who believe themselves unfamiliar with the data,\nwe point out that mixed quotation is one of the most\nfrequently used forms of quotation. Casually peruse any newspaper and you will find passages like the following from the New York Times: \nIn the 21st century, mixed quotation has become one of the central\ntopics in the theory of quotation: a range of interesting data has\nbeen brought to light and a flurry of theories have been\ndefended. In Section 4 below we introduce some of the\ndata. \n\nIn what follows we will refer back to these six features and make\nthe following assumption: \n\nIt is a necessary adequacy condition on a theory of quotation that it\neither explains how quotations can exhibit features (BQ1)–(BQ6),\nor, if it fails to do so, then it must present an argument for why any\nunexplained feature doesn’t require explanation. \nBefore going on, an important note: quotation, perhaps more than any other area of language, is difficult because not only is there no consensus about what the correct theory is, but there’s also basic disagreements about the space of options, and about the data to be accounted for. We’ll see this below, but it’s important to bear in mind that when it comes to quotation, the consensus is that there’s no consensus, and disagreement is the norm. \n\nBQ1–BQ6 play an important role because theories of quotation are\nattempts to answer certain questions, and those questions won’t have\nsatisfactory answers unless BQ1–BQ6 are accounted for. Three questions\ncan be thought of as the guiding questions for a theory of\nquotation: \n\nAlternatively, one might hold that quotations fail to refer at all,\nbut rather that speakers refer contingent upon the intentions with\nwhich they use an expression—with or without quotation\nmarks. \n\nQ2. How do quotations refer? \n\nAre they names, descriptions, demonstratives, functors or some\nsui generis linguistic category? \n\nIn addition to Q1 and Q2, theories of quotation often try answer a\nthird question: \n\nQ3. What do quotations refer to? \n\nWhat kinds of objects are picked out? Is it always the same object\nor are quotations\n ambiguous?[4] \n\nOur primary focus in what follows will be in Q1 and Q2, but along\nthe way we will also address Q3. \n (Section 5 is entirely devoted to Q3.) \n\nIt is standard practice in philosophy to distinguish the\nuse of an expression from the mentioning of it.\nConfusing these two is often taken to be a philosophical mortal sin.\nDespite its ubiquitous appeal, it is controversial exactly how to draw\nthe distinction. The initial thought is easy enough. Consider (D1) and\n(D2): \n\nD1. Jim went to Paris \n\nD2. ‘Jim’ has three letters \n\nIn (D1) the word ‘Jim’ is used to talk about (or signify,\nor denote) a person, i.e. Jim, and the sentence says about that person\nthat he went to Paris. In (D2) the word is not used in that way.\nInstead, ‘Jim’ is used to talk about (or signify or denote)\na word, i.e. ‘Jim’, and the sentence says about that word\nthat it has three\n letters[5].\nIn (D1), ‘Jim’ is being\nused and in (D2) it is being mentioned. \nThe initial thought seems right as far as it goes, but it might be thought it doesn’t go far enough. One might hope that we could say more to flesh it out in an uncontroversial way, a theory-neutral way that any party to the debate could agree on. In fact, though (and this is not recognized enough), this is not straightforward. To see this, consider a couple of ways to try to build on the initial characterization:\n \n\nA problem with this is that according to some theories, an expression can be mentioned\nwithout being quoted (see Objection 3 in section 3.3.2). \n\nThis is problematic in a couple of ways. First, notice that according to (ii), E must be\nused in order to mention it; that’s potentially puzzling. More\nsignificantly, it is controversial whether standard meta-linguistic\ndevices such as quotation are referring expressions. The theories\npresented in sections 3.2 and 3.3 treat quotations as descriptions. If\ndescriptions are quantified expressions, then quotations are\nquantifiers, and quantifiers are typically not treated as referring\nexpressions. Proposals along the lines of (ii) would also have to\nensure that ‘the first seven words in this sentence’ in\n(D3) don’t end up referring to ‘the first seven words in this\nsentence’: \n\nD3. The first seven words in this sentence contain thirty-two\nletters. \n\nWhat this suggests is that any attempt to\ncharacterize the distinction between use and mention\nmore sophisticated than the initial characterization in this section\nwill need to address at least some of the tricky issues that face the\nvarious theories of quotation we describe in what follows. \n\nThere are, roughly, five kinds of theories of quotation that have been\ncentral to the discussion of quotation: the Proper Name Theory, the\nDescription Theory, the Demonstrative/Paratactic Theory, the\nDisquotational Theory, and the Use/Identity Theory. (See here\nMaier’s taxonomy (2014b), which just includes the first four\ntheories, and which evaluates them according in terms of formal\ndesiderata like compositionality and productivity, and cf. Saka 2013,\nwhich includes ten. This divergence, incidentally, is a good\nillustration of the point we made above about lack of consensus among\ntheorists of quotation.) In the following sections we discuss each of\nthese and review their strengths and weaknesses. \n\nIt is now almost a tradition in the literature on quotation to include\na brief dismissive discussion of the Proper Name Theory of\nQuotation. This view is described, although not clearly endorsed, in\npassages in Quine and Tarski (e.g., Quine 1940, pp. 23–26; 1961,\np. 140; Tarski 1933, p. 159ff), and comments in passing in both\nReichenbach (1947, p. 335) and Carnap (1947, p. 4) strongly suggest\nthey were adherents. That said, there is some debate about whether\nQuine and Tarski ever held the view (see, e.g., Bennett 1988, Richard\n1986, Saka 1998, and Gomez-Torrente 2001). It is worth mentioning that\nalthough we quote them below, we do not thereby mean to attribute the\nProper Name Theory to them; we do so merely because they describe it\nclearly. \nUntil recently, it was generally held that the name theory was\n‘an utter failure’ (Saka 1998, p. 114), of interest only as\nshowing us how not to theorize about quotation. In recent years,\nhowever, there have been at least two defenses of something like the\nname theory (Gomez-Torrente 2013 and Johnson 2018). We here present\nthe reasons the name theory was long taken to be a non-starter, as\nwell as the responses to these problems by the authors mentioned\nabove. \n\nAccording to the Proper Name Theory, quotations are unstructured\nproper names of the quoted expressions. Quine writes: \n\nThe personal name buried within the first word of the statement\n‘‘Cicero’ has six letters’, e.g., is logically no more\ngermane to the statement than is the verb ‘let’ which is\nburied within the last word. (Quine 1940, p.  26) \n\nTarski formulates the view as follows: \n\nThe Proper Name Theory nicely accommodates (BQ1)–(BQ3); that is, on\nthis theory we see why co-referential expressions cannot be substituted\nfor one another. According to the Proper Name Theory, the name\n‘Cicero’ does not occur in\n‘‘Cicero’’; from the mere fact that Cicero = Tully, it does not follow that \n‘Tully’ can be substituted for ‘Cicero’ in\n‘‘Cicero’’. As Quine puts it, ‘[t]o make\nsubstitution upon a personal name, with such a context, would be no\nmore justifiable than to make a substitution upon the term\n‘cat’ within the context ‘cattle’ (Quine 1961,\np. 141). The Proper Name Theory permits the creation of new quotations\nmuch as natural languages permit the introduction of new names. And it\nprohibits quantifying in, since each quotation is a single word, and\nso there is nothing to quantify into. To see that this is so, think of\nthe left and right quotation marks as the 27th and\n28th letters of the roman alphabet; in that case quantifying into\n(4) in deriving (9) makes as much sense as deriving (16) from (14) and\n(15) by quantifying into (14): \n\nThe occurrence of the 24th letter of the alphabet in (9),\nas Quine notes with regards to a similar sentence, ‘is as\nirrelevant to the quantifier that precedes it as is the occurrence of\nthe same letter in the context ‘six’’ (Quine 1961, p.\n147). \n\nHere are three objections to the Proper Name Theory of Quotation.\n(The main objections are in Davidson (1979, pp. 81–83), though some\nwere anticipated by Geach (1957, p.79ff).) \n\nObjection 1: The Proper Name Theory cannot\nexplain how we can generate and interpret an indefinite number of novel\nquotations (see BQ5).\n\n \n\nIf quotations were proper names and lacked semantic structure\naltogether, then there would be no rule for determining how to\ngenerate or interpret novel quotations. To understand one would be to\nlearn a new name. (Remember, the quotation marks, according to Quine,\ncarry no more significance than the serifs you see on these letters.)\nBut (11), e.g., can be understood by someone who has never encountered\nits quoted symbol before. \n\nUnderstanding (11) is not like understanding a sentence with a\npreviously unknown proper name. Upon encountering (11), it would seem that\nyou know exactly which symbol is being referenced in a way that you do not with\na name you’ve never before encountered. \nFor a long time, this objection was thought fatal. However, a paper by\nMario Gomez-Torrente (2013) suggests a way to square something like\nthe name view with Objection 1. In brief, he points out that there are\nsome names that can be indefinitely generated and interpreted. For\nexample, street names. ‘East 6th Street’, presumably, is a\nbona fide name, but one doesn’t either need to individually\nbestow it on the particular street it applies to (the street between\nEast 5th and East 7th), nor does one need to have already learned it\nto understand what ‘East 6th Street has some great bars’\nmeans. \n\nObjection 2: There’s a special relationship\nbetween quotations and their semantic values (see BQ4).\n\n \n\nAccording to the Proper Name Theory, the relationship between\n“lobsters” and ‘lobsters’ is no closer than\nthe relationship between ‘lobsters’ and lobsters. That\nseems to miss the fundamental aspect of quotation spelled out in\n(BQ4). \n\nDavidson summarizes these first two objections succinctly: \nAgain, however, some work has pushed back against these old\nobjections. Michael Johnson (forthcoming) points to some names which\nbear special relationships to their referents. In particular, he\npoints to onomatopoeia. For example, ‘buzz’\nrefers to a sound, a buzzing sound. But the word ‘buzz’,\nwhen uttered, makes the sound it refers to. Roughly speaking, Johnson\nholds that we could view quotations in the same way: as he says,\n‘the name of a person sounds like the name of his name’\n(forthcoming). \n\nObjection 3: Proper Name Theory leaves no room\nfor dual use and mention (see BQ6).\n \n\nIf quotations were proper names, and if their interiors lacked\nsignificant structure, there would seem to be no room for dual usage of\nthe kind found in (12); indeed, on the Proper Name Theory, (12) has the\nsame interpretive form as (17): \n\nThat is, the Proper Name Theory fails to account for (BQ6). \n\nOther objections have been raised against the Proper Name Theory of\nQuotation. For further discussion, see Davidson (1979), Cappelen and\nLepore (1997b) and Saka (1998). Whether the recent defenders of the\nname theory will be able to take it off its deathbed remains to be\nseen, but it’s fair to say that their work shows that reports of\nits demise have been, at least, a bit premature. \n\nThe Description Theory of Quotation was introduced in order to\nguarantee that ‘a quoted series of expressions is always a series\nof quoted expressions’ (Geach 1957, p. 82) and not ‘a\nsingle long word, whose parts have no separate significance’\n(ibid., p. 82). According to this theory, there is a set of\nbasic units in each language: words, according to Geach\n(ibid., Ch. 18 and 1970); letters, according to Tarski\n(1956, p. 160) and Quine (1960, p. 143, p.\n 212)).[6] \n\nThis view retains the Proper Name Theory for basic quotations, e.g.,\naccording to Quine, “a” is a name of one letter,\n“b” a name of another, etc. For Geach, each word\nhas a quotation name. Complex quotations, i.e., quotations with more\nthan one basic unit, are understood as descriptions of concatenations\nof the basic units. Here is an illustration from Geach (where\n‘-’ is his sign for concatenation): \n\nFor Quine and Tarski, (4) gets analyzed as (18): \n\nwhere ‘-’ is their sign for concatenation and the\nindividual quotations are names of the letters. \n\nDavidson characterizes the difference between the two versions as\nfollows: \nThat is to say, if Geach’s theory were true, the appropriate representation of (4) is simply (4), whereas for Tarski and Quine it’s the much more unwieldy (18). On the other hand, a Geachian language has (at least) twice as many words as we might expect: for each word in the dictionary, there would also be the word that stands for that word (got by enclosing the initial word in quotation marks).\n \n\nIn one respect the Description Theory is an immense improvement over\nthe Proper Name Theory: it deals with no more than a finite set of\nbasic names, thus, potentially accommodating (BQ5). In other respects,\nhowever, the theory is, by a wide consensus, not much of an improvement\nover the Proper Name Theory. At the basic level, the theory still\ntreats quotations as names. So, at that level, it inherits many of the\nproblems confronting the simpler Proper Name Theory. Some of the more obvious objections\nare these (again we mention only some of the most obvious ones\nhere since the theory is not central to contemporary discussions): \n\nThe seminal paper on quotation in the twentieth century is, by almost universal consensus, Davidson’s ‘Quotation’ (1979). It\nis without comparison the most discussed and influential paper on the\nsubject. The view Davidson defends is called the Demonstrative Theory.\n(It is also called the Paratactic Theory, though we shall use the former\nlabel in our discussion.) The Demonstrative Theory is presented in the\nfinal pages of ‘Quotation’ and the key passages\n are\n these:[7] \n…quotation marks…help refer to a shape by pointing out\nsomething that has it…The singular term is the quotation marks,\nwhich may be read ‘the expression a token of which is\nhere’. (Davidson 1979, p. 90) \n\nOn my theory which we may call the demonstrative theory of\nquotation, the inscription inside does not refer to anything at all,\nnor is it part of any expression that does. Rather it is the quotation\nmarks that do all the referring, and they help to refer to a shape by\npointing out something that has it. (Davidson 1979, p. 90) \n\nQuotation marks could be warped so as to remove the quoted material\nfrom a sentence in which they play no semantic role. Thus instead\nof: \n\nwe could write: \n\nThe Demonstrative Theory has three central components. First, the\nquotation marks are treated as contributing a definite description\ncontaining a demonstrative to sentences in which they occur, i.e., the\nquotation marks in (4) become ‘The expression of which this is a\ntoken’, as in (19): Second, in the logical form of a sentence containing a quotation,\nthe token that occurs between the two quotation marks in the surface\nsyntax is discharged, so to speak, from the sentence containing the\nquotation.  What occurs between the quotation marks in the surface\nsyntax is not part of the sentence in which those quotation marks\noccur. It is demonstrated by a use of the quoting sentence. Third, utterances of quotation marks, by virtue of having a\ndemonstrative/indexical ingredient, refer to the expression\ninstantiated by the demonstrated token, i.e., the expression\ninstantiated by the token that in surface syntax sits between the\nquotation marks. \n\nThe Demonstrative Theory is attractive for at least five\nreasons. First, to grasp the function of quotation marks is to acquire\na capacity with infinite applications (BQ5). The Demonstrative Theory\nexplains why: there’s no limit to the kinds of entities we can\ndemonstrate.  Hence, (BQ5) is explained without making quotation a\nproductive device (for elaboration see Cappelen and Lepore\n1997b). \nSecond, opacity is explained (BQ1): There’s no reason to think\nthat two sentences demonstrating different objects will have the same\ntruth-value. (4) and (8) demonstrate different objects, so\nthere’s no more reason to think the move from (4) to (8) is\ntruth preserving than there is to think that the move from (20) to\n(21) is: \nThird, we have an elegant explanation of mixed quotation, i.e., we can\nexplain (BQ6). Davidson says: \n\nThis, according to Davidson, is what goes on in (12). A token that is\nbeing used for one purpose is at the same time demonstrated for\nanother: ‘Any token may serve as target for the arrows of\nquotation, so in particular a quoting sentence may after all by chance\ncontain a token with the shape needed for the purposes of\nquotation’ (Davidson 1979, pp. 90–91; cf., also, Cappelen\nand Lepore 1997b). On this view, (12) is understood as (22).  (Note:\nthe ‘these’ in (22) is accompanied by a pointing or\nindexing to the token of Quine’s words.) Fourth, there is no mystery about how to introduce new vocabulary;\nsince there’s no limit to what can be demonstrated,\nthere’s no limit to what can be quoted. (BQ3) is explained. Finally, quantifying-in is obviously ruled out, since the quoted\ntoken is placed outside the quoting sentence, i.e., the Demonstrative\nTheory can explain (BQ2). \n\nThe Demonstrative Theory is both bold and radical. It triggered an\nentire cottage industry devoted to criticizing and defending it. For\nproponents, see, for example, Partee (1973), Garcia-Carpintero (1994,\n2017, forthcoming), Cappelen and Lepore (1997b), McCullagh (2007),\nPredelli (2008); for critics, see just about anyone else writing on\nquotation after 1979. \n\nIn what follows we present five criticisms of the Demonstrative\nTheory. Needless to say, the list is not exhaustive (e.g., see\nSorensen 2008 and Saka 2011b on the problem of empty quotation),\nand indeed, each objection has triggered lively discussion which space\nlimitations prohibit our taking up here. \n\nObjection 1. If the Demonstrative Theory were\ncorrect, it should be possible for (4) to demonstrate, e.g., a\npenguin.\n\n \n\nHere is an argument that mimics a range of objections raised against\nDavidson’s account of the semantics for indirect reports (Burge\n1986, Stainton\n 1999).[9] \nRecall that according to Davidson the logical form of (4) is\n(19). \n\n(19) contains a demonstrative and demonstratives refer to whatever\nis demonstrated with their use. What is demonstrated on a given\noccasion depends on the speaker (either the demonstration or the\nintention or some combination of the two). It should be possible, then,\nfor a speaker to utter (4) and not demonstrate the exhibited\ntoken of ‘bachelor’. That is to say, if there really is a\ndemonstrative in (19), that demonstrative should have the same kind of\nfreedom that other demonstratives have: it should be able to refer to,\nfor example, a nearby penguin. Of course, no utterance of (4) makes\nreference to a penguin. So the Demonstrative Theory is\n wrong.[10]\n (For replies to this objection see Cappelen and Lepore 1999b.) \n\nObjection 2. The Problem of\nRelevant Features \n\nAccording to Davidson, a quotation refers to an expression indirectly,\nby referring to a token that instantiates that expression.  Davidson\nthinks expressions are shapes or patterns (see\nDavidson 1979, p. 90). A problem for this view is that any one token\ninstantiates indefinitely many distinct shapes or patterns, i.e.  many\ndifferent expressions. So how, on Davidson’s view, do we get from a\nparticular token to a unique type, i.e., from a token to an\nexpression? \n\nJonathan Bennett formulates the problem as follows: \n\nA related worry is this: Read (4) out loud. It seems obvious that a\nspoken utterance says (makes) the same claim as a written utterance of\n(4). On the Demonstrative Theory it is unclear why this should be so:\nthe spoken utterance demonstrates a vocal pattern, and the written\nutterance a graphemic pattern. They seem to be attributing properties\nto different objects. (Several suggestions are on offer for how to\namend the Demonstrative Theory in this respect: cf., Garcia-Carpintero\n1994, Cappelen and Lepore 1997b, 1999c, and Davidson 1999.) \n\nObjection 3. The Problem of Missing Quotation\nMarks\n \n\nAccording to Davidson, quotation marks are what are used to do the\nreferring. They are descriptions containing demonstratives whose uses\nrefer to whatever pattern is instantiated by the demonstrated token.\nThis makes the presence of quotation marks essential. Much recent work\non quotation argues that we can quote (or do something quote-like)\nwithout quotation marks and that a theory of quotation should\nbe capable of explaining how quotation can take place in the absence of\nquotation marks. Here is Reimer’s version of this objection: Consider the following sentence: \n\nHere, we have a case in which an expression is quoted—not by means\nof quotation marks—but by means of italicization. But surely it would\nbe absurd to suppose (consistently with Davidson’s view) that the\nitalicization of (7)’s subject term is itself a demonstrative\nexpression! (Reimer 1996, p. 135) \n\nThe same idea is expressed by Washington (1992): \n\nThe Demonstrative Theory depends on the presence of quotation marks\n(inasmuch as they are what get used to do the referring), so if\nquotation can occur without quotation marks (as in the Reimer and\nWashington cases), it’s hard to see how the Demonstrative Theory is\nadequate. \n\nProponents have been unimpressed. Consider an utterance of (6): Several possible replies can be made by proponents of the\nDemonstrative Theory.  One thing a Demonstrative Theorist might say is\nthat there are no missing quotation marks in (6): they are in the\nlogical form of the sentence, not in its surface syntax. Alternatively, quotation marks for an utterance of (6) could be\ngenerated as conversational or conventional implicatures. (He\ncan’t be saying that Donald, the person, is his name as he knows\nthat that is false, so he must be conversationally implicating that\nthe expression of which he used a token is a name\n(cf. Garcia-Carpintero 1994, pp. 262–63)). Or by an appeal to the\ndistinction between semantic reference and speaker reference. (6) is\ngrammatically correct but false; nonetheless, someone can succeed in\ncommunicating something true about Donald’s name if he succeeds\nin conveying to his audience his intention to refer to it (cf.,\nGomez-Torrente 2001). Finally, a Demonstrative Theorist can argue that these other\nquotation-like phenomena are just that—quotation-like. They\nrequire a separate treatment. There’s no need for a unified\ntheory (cf., Cappelen and Lepore 2003). \n\nObjection 4. The Problem of Iteration \n\nThe Demonstrative Theory seems to have difficulty dealing with\niterated quotation. (24) refers to the quotation in (23): \n\nThe Demonstrative Theory’s account for (23) is (25). \n\nHow, then, can the account accommodate (24)? (24), after all, includes\ntwo sets of quotation marks. It might seem like the\nDemonstrative Theory would have to treat it as the ungrammatical (26)\nor the unintelligible (27). \n\nThis objection has been raised by Saka (1998, pp. 119–20), Reimer\n(1996), and Washington (1992). \n\nIn response, Demonstrative Theorists insist that quotations are not\niterative. Cappelen and Lepore write: \n\nFor further discussion of whether quotation is a genuinely iterative\ndevice, see Cappelen and Lepore (1999a) and Saka (2013). \n\nObjection 5. The Problem of Open Quotation:\nDangling Singular Terms\n\n \n\nRecanati (2001) focuses on cases where quoted expressions do not\nserve as noun phrases in sentences. He has in mind cases like (29) and\n(30): \n\nIn these cases it looks like the Demonstrative Theory would have to\npostulate a dangling singular term, something like (31) or (32): \n\nIn response to the idea that (29) is elliptical for (33), \n\nRecanati says: \n\nLess baroque than the Demonstrative Theory, the Disquotational Theory\nis probably the simplest, most natural and obvious account of\nquotation. It is endorsed by a wide range of authors, often in passing,\nas if completely obvious. A simple version of it can be found in\nRichard’s Disquotational Schema (DQR): \n\nDQR: For any expression e, the left quote (lq) followed by e\nfollowed by the right quote (rq) denotes e (Richard 1986, p. 397)\n\n \n\nLudwig and Ray write: \n\nwhere the ‘┌’ and\n‘┐’ are the left and right corner\nquotes. (See also Smullyan 1957, Mates 1972, p. 21; Wallace 1972,\np. 237; Salmon 1986, p. 6, Gomez-Torrente 2001, Botteral and Stainton\n2005. A nearby view is the minimalism of Cappelen and Lepore 2007;\ndiscussion of it can be found in Garcia-Carpintero 2011.) \n\nOn this account, quotations are not proper names, or descriptions or\ndemonstratives but rather they are functors that take an expression as\ntheir argument and return it as value. \n\nThe two most obvious strengths of the Disquotational Theory are its\nsimplicity and intuitiveness. If asked how quotation functions, the\nobvious reply is something along the lines of (DQR). It is also an\naxiom (or axiom schema) that’s pleasingly simple and requires no\ncomplicated assumptions about the surface structure of the sentence\n(in this respect, it has a clear edge on the Demonstrative Theory). \n\nIn addition to be being exceedingly simple and intuitive, this\ntheory easily accounts for three of the Basic Facts about\nQuotation. \nFirst, it explains opacity: ‘bachelor’ and\n‘unmarried man’ have different semantic values because\nwhat is between the quotation marks are distinct expressions. An\nexpression’s semantic value is irrelevant for determining the\nsemantic value of the quotation of that expression, thus accounting\nfor (BQ1). Second, since quotations are functor expressions without internal\nstructure, (BQ2) is explained: there’s no possibility of\nquantifying into a quotation on this view. Finally, since quotations, as functors, map all expressions onto themselves,\nthis account can explain the special relationship between a quotation\nand the quoted expression—namely, identity—thus explaining\n(BQ4). \n\nEven with these advantages, at least three serious difficulties\nconfront the Disquotational Theory. \n\n(DQR) says we can take any expression e, put quotation\nmarks around e, and what results is an expression that refers to e. What\nexactly is meant by ‘any expression’ in (DQR)? Richard\noffers the following answer: \n\nIf this is how expressions are generated, how then are we to account\nfor the truth of (9) and (10)? More generally, the worry is this: (DQR)\nneeds to specify, in some manner or other, the domain of expressions over\nwhich it quantifies. How can it do this without unreasonably limiting\nthe kinds of symbols that can be\n quoted?[11]\n (See Lepore (1999) for elaboration on this point.) Second, according to (BQ6), a theory of quotation should leave room for\ndual use and mention. It is hard to see how (DQR) leaves such room. If\nquotes are referring expressions (as they are according to DQR), then\nif we let ‘Ted’ name the expression ‘has a certain\nanomalous feature’, (12) should say the same as, express the\nsame proposition as, (17). Not only should (12) and (17) express the same proposition, according\nto DQR, they should also have the same logical form. That’s an\nobviously incorrect account of (12). (For further discussion of mixed\nquotation \n see Section 4 below.) \nFinally, those who raise Objection 4 against the Demonstrative Theory would\nprobably raise the same objection here: the Disquotational Theory\nfails to account for quotation without quotation marks. All the work\nis being done by quotation marks, so there’s no room for quotation\nwithout quotation marks. (DQR) proponents would presumably be as\nunimpressed as Demonstrative Theorists and their replies would be much\nthe same (see above). \n\nThe label ‘the Identity Theory of Quotation’ was first\nused, as far as we know, by Washington (1992), though he attributes the\nview to Frege (1892) and Searle (1969). However, the passages in which\nthis view was allegedly offered prior to Washington hardly count as\npresenting a theory; they read more like dogmatic pronouncements devoid\nof argumentation. Since Washington’s paper was published related views have been developed in more detail by Saka (1998, 2004, 2011a), Reimer (1996),\nRecanati (2000, 2001) and others. \n\nWashington’s presentation of the Identity Theory is somewhat\ncompressed—the key passage is this: \n\nThere are three important components of this\n view:[12],[13] \n\nOne way to get a handle on this kind of view is to consider a spoken\nutterance of (6) \n\nAccording to the Use/Identity theory, (6), when spoken, is grammatical\n(Washington 1992, pp. 588–90). There are no missing (or implicit)\nquotation marks. When uttered by a person whose name is\n‘Donald’ it is true (if ‘Donald’ is used\nquotationally). The function of quotation marks in written language is\nsimply to indicate that words are being used in this special,\nquotational, way, i.e. not (only) with their regular extensions. In\nother words, ‘Donald’ can be used in two different ways:\nwith its usual semantic value (its regular referent) or\nquotationally. In the latter case, its semantic value is an\nexpression. We wish that the Identity Theory were not called ‘the\nIdentity Theory’. (In private communication, Washington has\nexpressed the same sentiment.) The ‘identity’ component is\npicked up from the formulation, ‘a quoted expression is related\nto its value by identity: a quoted expression mentions itself’.\nThis formulation, however, is deeply misleading, since according to both Washington (and later,\nfor example, Saka (1998)), quotations are ambiguous. They can,\naccording to Washington, refer to types, tokens, or shapes (see\nWashington 1992, p. 594) and according to another proponent of this\nkind of view, Saka, they are even more flexible (Saka 1998, see\nfurther presentation of Saka’s view below). A better label would be\n‘the Use-Theory of Quotation’, since this emphasizes the\npoint that a proper understanding of quotation requires appealing to a\nspecial way of using language. In what follows, we use the ungainly\ncompromise ‘the Use/Identity Theory’. \n\nIt is useful to contrast Washington’s account with the\nDisquotational Theory. Recall, that, according to DQR, quotation\nmarks have a semantic function and that function is spelled out in\nthe disquotational schema (DQR). (DQR) is a semantic axiom. It treats\nquotation marks as identity functions. Speakers’ intentions figure not\nat all in this axiom (other than the intention to speak English). There\nis no need, on the Disquotational Theory, to appeal to a special kind\nof quotational usage. For Washington, the quotation marks have no\ngenuine semantic function. They are no more than a heuristic device for\nindicating that expressions are used in a special way, i.e.\nquotationally. \n\nSeveral recent views share important components of Washington’s. Reimer\n(2003) combines versions of the Demonstrative Theory and the Identity\nTheory. Recanati (2000, 2001, 2010) doesn’t explicitly discuss any\nversion of the Identity Theory, but his theory incorporates some of its\ncomponents; it is distinctive by focusing on what he calls ‘Open\nQuotation’ (see Objection 5 to the Demonstrative Theory above)\nand the iconic aspects of quotation (see Recanati 2001 for\nelaboration). Two theories might be worth a closer look for those\ninterested in exploring Use/Identity Theories further (the second of\nthese is mostly of historical interest). \nFirst, Saka (1998, 1999, 2003) has developed a theory that has\nmuch in common with Washington’s (though it also differs in important\nrespects). He agrees with Washington in emphasizing ‘quotational\nuse’ (Saka calls it ‘mentioning’), but Saka has more\nto say about mentioning than Washington has to say about quotational\nuse (see Saka 1998 and 2003). Saka also goes further than\nWashington in claiming that quotation marks are not required for\nmentioning even in written language. (For Washington, it is only in\nspoken language that we can quote without quotation marks). According\nto Saka, (34) ‘is a grammatical and true sentence’ (Saka 1998, p.118.) \n\nEven though Saka agrees with Washington that quotation marks\n‘announce ‘I am not (merely) using expression X;\nI am also mentioning it’’ (Saka 1998, p. 127), he\ndiffers from Washington in that he assigns them a genuine syntactic\nand semantic function (Saka, 1998, p. 128). In this respect he\nincorporates components of what we above called the Disquotational\nTheory.[14],[15] \n\nSaka’s account also differs from Washington’s in that he emphasizes\nthat quotations are ambiguous (or indeterminate) and that what they\nrefer to depends on the speaker’s intentions (see Saka 1998, pp.\n123–4). For further discussion of this point, \n see Section 5 below. Second, there is one view we have not discussed and which might\n(admittedly with some difficulty) be squeezed into the category of the\nUse/Identity Theory. Quine said a number of things about quotation; in\none passage he writes: \nDavidson (1979), taking his cue from this passage and others, baptized\nthe view intimated in Quine’s passage as ‘the Picture Theory of\nQuotation’ (cf., also, Christensen 1967, p. 362). As Davidson\nnotes, on this view: \n\nNotice that according to Davidson’s description of this view, the\nquotation marks per se have no semantic function; rather,\nthey indicate that the words are being used in a special way. They are\nbeing used ‘autonymously’, that is, to name\nthemselves.  So understood, the Picture Theory has at least\nthis much in common with a Use/Identity Theory: they agree that\nquotation marks are inessential; they only indicate a special\nuse. They indicate that expressions are being used as a picture (or as\na hieroglyph). The Picture Theory—if it’s even appropriate\nto call it a theory—is never elaborated in any great detail and\nwe suspect that if it were, it would become obvious that it is a\nversion of the Use/Identity Theory. \n\nUse/Identity Theorists claim that their theories are explanatorily\nmore powerful than traditional semantic theories. By seeing quotation\nmarks as a parasitic phenomenon, they are able to explain the semantics\nof both quotation and this more general phenomenon in a unified\nway. \n\nThere’s a great deal of specific data that these theories claim to be\nable to explain. The most important of these is the possibility of\nmentioning without quotation marks (as in spoken language and in\nwritten language when no quotation marks are used). If we take\nappearances at face value, that means meta-linguistic discourse (call\nit mentioning or quotational use) can take place in the absence of\nquotation marks. Hence, an account of meta-linguistic discourse must\nproceed independently of an account of the semantics (or pragmatics)\nfor quotation marks. \n\nThe following are additional claims made on behalf of the\nUse/Identity Theory (we take it to be an open question at this point\nwhether these points are sustainable): \n\nDiscussion of the Use/Identity Theories is not yet as extensive as\ndiscussion of the Demonstrative Theory, so there are fewer objections\nto report. We discuss four concerns that have surfaced in various\ndiscussions. \n\nQuestion about the Relevance of Quotational Use/Mention:\nUse/Identity Theories put a great deal of weight on the idea that the\nsemantics for quotation cannot be developed without an account of\nquotational usage (mention in Saka’s terminology.) There\nare several reasons for doubting this, two of which are these: \n\nQuestion about the Semantics-Pragmatics Divide: On the\nUse/Identity Theory, a lot of work is done by pragmatic mechanisms.\nThe appeal to speaker intentions plays a central role on all levels of\nanalysis. On Saka’s view, for example, what a quoted expression refers\nto is largely up to the speaker’s intentions (and, maybe, what’s\nsalient in the context of utterance). A consequence of this view is\nthat there is no guarantee, for example, that an utterance of (35) or\n(36) will be true: \n\nThe two ‘a’s in (35) could refer to different\nobjects; the “run” in (36) might refer to, for example, a\nconcept (see Cappelen and Lepore 1999b and Saka 1999, 2003, 2011). \n\nOver-generation Problems: According to Use/Identity Theories,\nyou can do a lot with quotation. The question is whether this results\nin such theories running into problems of over-generation.  Take, for\nexample, Saka’s claim that a quotation refers to an item\nassociated with the expression. There’s only one restriction:\nThis item cannot be the expression’s regular extension. If this is the\nsole restriction on what quotations can be used to refer to,\nwe should be able to do things with quotation that there’s no evidence\nthat we can. It could, for example, be the case that in a particular\ncontext, the (regular) extension of ‘love’, call it\nlove, was associated with the expression ‘money’;\nmaybe, for some reason, that association was contextually salient.\nNonetheless, (37) cannot be used to say that love plays a\ncentral role in many peoples’ lives. \n\nUse/Identity Theories have to explain what blocks such readings (or\nshow that they are possible). (See Saka 2003, and Cappelen and Lepore\n2003.) \n\nDual Use-Mention (BQ6): Washington says that quotation marks\nindicate quotational usage and that expressions used quotationally\nrefer to themselves (or some related entity). If so, the logical form\nof (12) should be that of (17), clearly not a correct result. \n\nIt is at least a challenge to Identity/Use theorists to explain how\nthe theory can accommodate simultaneous use and mention. \n\nIn addition to the above points, there’s a lively debate about\nthe specifics of identity/use theories. For discussions of Saka, see\nCappelen and Lepore (2003), Reimer (2003), and for discussions of\nRecanati, see Cappelen and Lepore (2003), Reimer (2003), Benbaji\n(2003, 2004a, 2004b), and Cumming (2003). \n\nWe now turn from discussions of large-scale theories of quotation to\ndiscussions of how to understand specific aspects of our quotational\npractice. Two issues have been particularly important in the recent\ndiscussions: Mixed Quotation and the alleged ambiguity of quotations.\nOne’s view of these issues has wide reaching implications for which\ntheory of quotation one favors. We discuss these in turn. From around the millennium, beginning with Cappelen and\nLepore’s 1997a, which made the topic mainstream, mixed quotation\nhas been, arguably, the area in which theorizing about quotation has\nadvanced the most. The problem has attracted the attention of both\nphilosophers and linguists, and our understanding of both the data to\nbe accounted for, and the various possibilities for doing so, has been\ngreatly improved. It’s important to reiterate our above note that here as\nelsewhere in the theory of quotation what comprises the phenomenon is\nup for debate; different theorists emphasise or play down different\nbits of data. What follows, accordingly, doesn’t represent a\nconsensus position on the problem, simply because there is none\n(indeed, somewhat unfortunately, there isn’t even consensus\nabout the terminology, some calling it ‘hybrid’ or ‘impure’, and some\nsubsuming mixed quotation under ‘scare quoting’; De Brabanter 2010 is\nhelpful here, as well as being a useful survey of the field from a\nlinguist’s point of view). We will simply present some of the\nmore interesting and central data points and problems for a theory of\nmixed quotation (for the theories themselves, we refer the reader to\nMaier’s (2017) overview article which presents some of the main\nformal semantic theories out there. For recent theories by\nphilosophers on mixed quotation, see Gomez-Torrente 2005, Kirk and\nLudwig 2017, McCullagh 2007, 2017. The main linguists to consult are\ncited in this section.) The paradigm example of mixed quotation is the following, repeated: \nIt is mostly agreed that this sentence puts forward the following\nclaim: Quine said (expressed the proposition or content) that\nquotation has an anomalous feature, and did so by uttering the\nexpression ‘has an anomalous feature’. This suggests two\ninitial requirements: \nLet’s call these the use requirement and\nthe mention requirement, respectively. \nWhile these both seem clearly on the right lines (if you doubt this,\nopen or scroll to a newspaper and read until you find the first mixed\nquotation (it shouldn’t take long) and see if the requirements\nare operative) there are problems with both of them. It might\ninitially seem that the mention requirement requires that the reportee\nhave uttered verbatim the words ascribed to him or her. That would\naccount for the anomalousness of:\n \nThings aren’t so clear, though. Certain other pieces of data are in tension with this purported feature of the mention requirement, most notably that one can mixed quote someone correctly in a language other than the one they spoke (Cappelen and Lepore 2007 p. 44). Thus the following, as well as its parenthesised continuation, is fine: \nMoreover, more subtle problems for the use requirement come from\ninflected languages (Shan 2010, Maier 2014a). Thus in Italian, nouns\nmust agree in gender and number with adjectives. Imagine Ken says: \nThis means ‘I find Italian men very cute’, and since the\nnoun ‘uomini’ (men) is m.pl, so is the adjective\n‘carini’ (cute). But if one wanted to mixed quote Ken,\nusing a different word than ‘uomini’, that different word\nwould have to agree: \nSo the mixed quoted material used to report Ken’s utterance is not what he said verbatim: he said ‘carini’ and he is reported as saying ‘carine’ (the example is from Shan 2010). Maier presents similar cases for Dutch. Yet a third problem comes from the fact that one can ‘clean up’ quotations, by removing grammatical slurs, umms and ahhs, and so on (see Cappelen and Lepore 2007 p. 45).\n \nWhat exactly the mention requirement requires is uncertain, then. But\nnor, however, is the use requirement without its problems. There are\nat least two, which again differ in subtlety. From the beginning,\nit’s been realised that indexicals in mixed quotations cause\nintriguing problems. Consider: \nIf the second mixed quotation were simply being used, then the second\nsentence should be true provided accord was a surprise to the people\nwriting the report, not to Greenspan and Reich. That’s clearly\nthe wrong result, and shows that the use requirement needs some\nmodifiction (for discussion about indexicals in mixed quotation, and\nwhether they call for Kaplanian monstrous operators, see also Recanati\n(2001), Cumming (2003), Geurts and Maier (2003), and Maier\n(2016)). \nThe behaviour of indexicals in mixed quotation is important, because\nit gives strong evidence against the possibility that mixed quotation\nis a pragmatic phenomenon. A typical pragmatic analysis would say that\nthe semantic contribution of the quoted material in a mixed quotation\nis just its unquoted semantic value (so that the literal semantic\ncontent of (12) is simply ‘Quine said that quotation has a\ncertain anomalous feature’), but that to utter a mixed quotation\nis to imply, but not to say, that the quoted material was used by the\nspeaker to say what they said. The advantages of a pragmatic analysis of mixed quotation are those\ntypical of pragmatic analyses in general: no extra semantic machinery\nis required to account for the problem cases. As such, versions of\nsuch an analysis have had many adherents at the end of the twentieth\ncentury (see, for example, Recanati (2001), Clark & Gerrig (1990),\nWilson (2000), Sperber & Wilson (1981), Tsohatzidis (1998),\nStaintion (1999), Saka (2003) and the discussion in by Reimer\n(2003)). However, the behaviour of indexicals in mixed quotation make the\npragmatic analysis harder to uphold. One needs to say that (42) is\nliterally false, and while that is a move that can be made, it’s\nnot particularly attractive, and so the pragmatic analysis has gone\nsomewhat out of fashion, and has been argued against explicitly\nexplicitly by Gomez-Torrente (2017), and implicitly by most of the\nlinguists working in the field, who view the behaviour of indexicals\nas a key explanandum of a theory of mixed quotation, and not something\nto be explained away. \nThe second, more subtle, problem is a consequence of the fact that one\ncan mixed quote an expression belonging to a dialect other than the\none one speaks, or even to no dialect at all (Shan 2010). Thus even in\ninformal British English, ‘accident’ always takes the\npreposition ‘by’ and never ‘on’. A British\nspeaker can draw attention to this fact, by uttering, about an\nAmerican friend of theirs: \nBut a British speaker can’t felicitiously use ‘on\naccident’ because that’s not a part of British English speakers'\ndialect. Similarly, ‘misunderestimated’ isn’t a word\nin most anybody’s dialects, but we can say: \nA different, more fundamental, source of complication arises from the\nfact that it’s unclear exactly how much to include under mixed\nquotation. Thus consider: \nShould we include such phenomena in our theory of mixed quotation? The\nfirst sentence doesn’t contain a speech verb, while the second\ndoes, but the person to whom the mixed quotation is attributed\nisn’t the person who uttered the mixed quoted words. It’s\nunclear. Things get even more uncertain when we consider scare quotes\n(Predelli 2003a,b, Saka 2013, Gomez-Torrente 2017) and what are known\neuphemistically as grocers’ quotes: \nIn the former case, there isn’t any one person who used\n‘sexting’; rather, the writer is marking that it’s\nused in a community which they are not part of or disapprove of. In\nthe latter case, the quotation marks are serving as emphasis. While we\nprobably don’t want to spend a lot of time seriously theorizing\nabout grocers’ quotes (although see Abbott 2003), whether or not\nscare quotes should be treated as we treat mixed quotation (indeed,\nwhether or not they’re one and the same) is an open question\n(see McCullagh 2017 for discussion and an affirmative answer to these\nquestions; Gomez-Torrente 2017 demurs). \nThis isn’t even an exhaustive characterization. Thus it’s\nimportant to attend to cognate phenomena like dequotation (Shan 2010)\nand free indirect discourse (Maier 2015, 2017). And the theorist of\nmixed quotation should at least be aware of the problem of mixed\nquoting non-constituent clauses (Abbott 2003), and the possibility\nthat one can mixed quote without quotation marks (De Brabanter\n2010). The complexity of the data has inspired much interesting\ntheorizing, and we expect that mixed quotation will continue to be a\nfocal question in the theory of quotation.  \n\nRunning parallel to the debate about how quotations refer\n(how they manage to hook up with their semantic values) is a debate\nabout what quotations refer to. One view that is widespread\nis that quotations are ambiguous or indeterminate. That is, one and\nthe same quotation, e.g. “lobster” can, on this view,\nrefer to different objects on different occasions of use, all\ndepending on the context of utterance. Garcia-Carpintero (1994,\np. 261) illustrates this kind of view and the kind of argument\ntypically given for it. He says that “gone” can refer to\nany of the following: \n\nOthers think quotation can pick out contents or concepts. Goldstein\nsays: \n\nSaka (1998, p. 124) concurs and claims that “premise” and\n“premiss” in (38) pick out concepts: \n\nTsohatzidis (1998) claims that since T1 is true, even though Descartes\ndidn’t speak English, “is a thinking substance” in T1\ncan’t refer to an English expression. \n\n(T1) In one of the greatest philosophy books ever written in Latin,\nDescartes said that man ‘is a thinking substance’. \n\nThese arguments all take the same form: first, they identify a\nsentence S that we are inclined to interpret as true and\nsuggest that the only way to understand how S can be true is\nto assume that quotations can refer to some kind of object\nO. This is then alleged to be evidence that quotations can be\nused to refer to objects of kind O. \n\nIf quotation has this kind of flexibility, the five theories\ndiscussed above will all have to be evaluated with respect to whether\nthey can accommodate it. The Proper Name Theory, Description theory,\nand Disquotational Theory, all seem to have particular difficulties in\nthis respect. \n\nNot all, however, are convinced that quotations are flexible in just\nthis way. Some have expressed skepticism both about the form of\nargument (see Cappelen and Lepore 1999a) and about the specific\nexamples. Cappelen and Lepore (1999a) also argue that the multiple\nambiguity view over-generates, i.e., it predicts that it is possible to\nexpress propositions with quotation sentences that it is not possible\nto express with such sentences. For further discussion, see also Saka\n(2003). \n\nA number of authors over the years have thought that our standard\npractices of quotation are not suitable for all purposes and have, in\neffect, introduced new technical devices. They cannot all be summarized\nhere, but here is a brief sketch of some such devices. \n\nReichenbach (1947, p. 284) writes: ‘Whereas the\nordinary-quotes operation leads from a word to the name of that word,\nthe token-quotes operation leads from a token to a token denoted by that\ntoken’. Reichenbach uses little arrows (\\(\\tokenquote{\\,}\\))\nfor token quotes, so that the sign (39): \n\nrepresents not a name for the token of ‘a’, but a token\nfor it. That is, the token in (39) cannot be repeated. (40), for\nexample, is not only a token different from (39) but refers to a\ndifferent token (Reichenbach 1947, pp. 285–86). \n\nToken quotes then are much like writing a demonstrative expression\nlike ‘this’ and fastening to it an object to produce a\nsymbol of that object. (As noted above, some authors (Bennett 1988,\nSaka 1998, Washington 1992) opine that this is how ordinary\nquotation sometimes functions.) \n\nAs Quine (1940, §6) notes, the quotation: \n\ndesignates only the specific expression therein depicted, containing a\nspecific Greek letter. In order to effect reference to the unspecified\nexpression he introduces a new notation of corners (namely,\n‘┌’ and\n‘┐’). So, for example, if we take the\nexpression ‘Quine’ as μ, then\n┌(μ)┐ is\n‘(Quine)’. The quasi-quotation is synonymous with the\nfollowing verbal description: The result of writing ‘(’\nand then μ and ‘)’ (Quine 1940, p. 36). For an\ninteresting suggestion about quasi-quotation in natural language, see\nSaka (2017). \n\nSomeone who uses the word ‘red’ in speaking or thinking\nwould generally be held to be employing the same concept as a French\nperson who uses ‘rouge’. Assuming that ‘rouge’\nis a good translation of ‘red’, Sellars (1963) thought it\nconvenient to have a general term by which to classify words that are\nfunctional counterparts in this way. Such a term is provided by\nSellars’ dot quotes. Dot-quotes form a common noun true of items in\nany language that play the role performed in our language by the\ntokens exhibited between them, so any expression that is a functional\ncounterpart to ‘red’ can be described as a\n·red·. In Sellars’ terminology,\nthe concept red is something that is common and peculiar to\n·red·s. Consider (41): Michael Ernst claims this sentence is ambiguous. Read one way, (41)\nmeans that the concatenation of the first letter of the Roman alphabet\nwith the second letter is an expression; read another way it means\nthat the expression between the two outer quote marks is an\nexpression.  Confronted with this ambiguity, Boolos (1995) introduced\na notation for quotation in which every quotation mark ‘knows\nits mate’.  So understood there are denumerably many distinct\nquotation marks, each formed by prefixing a natural number n of\nstrokes to a small circle, and in order to meaningfully enclose an\nexpression with Boolos quotation marks we have to choose quotation\nmarks of a ‘higher order’ than the quotation marks that\noccur in the expression to be quoted (if there are any) and each\nquotation mark in a grammatical sentence is to be ‘paired’\nwith the next identical quotation mark (Boolos 1995,\np. 291). Accordingly, reading (41) as containing Boolos quotation\nmarks, we get the more natural reading according to which it says that\nthe first letter of the Roman alphabet concatenated with the second is\nan expression. \n\nCarnap introduced in Logical Syntax of Language (1937) a\ndistinction between formal and material modes. The material mode is\ngenerally used to describe the non-linguistic world; the formal mode\nis generally used to discuss the language that is used to describe the\nmaterial world. Thus ‘one is a number’ is a sentence in\nmaterial mode; and ‘‘one’ is a number\nword’ is its sentential counterpart in formal mode. This\ndistinction is mentioned in passing here since some authors have\nthought it corresponds to the use/mention distinction. Since the\nuse/mention distinction isn’t particularly about quotation, there\nisn’t much that needs to be said about the material/formal mode here\neither.  Revealing that a statement is basically about the use of\nlanguage may succeed in removing some of its metaphysical mystery. And\nit may even be that semantic ascent (that is, the device of making a\nsentence the topic, instead of what the sentence purports to refer to)\nsucceeds in demystifying much of what goes on in certain quarters of\nphilosophy. But as we’ve said, this distinction, and the various\nphilosophical moves surrounding it, doesn’t have much to do with\nquotation per se.","contact.mail":"mipmckeever@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
