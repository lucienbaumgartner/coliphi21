Throughout the middle decades of the\ntwentieth century he exercised considerable influence on a number of\nareas of philosophical inquiry: especially on epistemology, the\nphilosophy of religion, and political theory.\n\n\n\nThe influence of Kant over Jaspers is widely acknowledged in the\nliterature, to the extent that he has been depicted as “The\nfirst and the last Kantian” (Heinrich Barth, quoted in Ehrlich\n1975, 211). Usually this evaluation is based on his reliance on the\nsubjective-experiential transformation of Kantian philosophy, which\nreconstructs Kantian transcendentalism as a doctrine of particular\nexperience and spontaneous freedom, and emphasizes the constitutive\nimportance of lived existence for authentic knowledge. However,\ncurrent commentators of his philosophy have started questioning this\nview.  Jaspers obtained his widest influence, not through his\nphilosophy, but through his writings on governmental conditions in\nGermany, and after the collapse of National Socialist regime he\nemerged as a powerful spokesperson for moral-democratic education and\nreorientation in the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\n\n\nDespite his importance in the evolution of both philosophy and\npolitical theory in twentieth-century Germany, today Jaspers is to a\nlarge extent a neglected thinker. The explanations that are given for\nthis are various. In the first place, it is argued that he did not\nfound a particular philosophical school. For him, philosophy is a way\nof thought, which uses expert knowledge while going beyond it. He\nbelieved that by means of devoting oneself to philosophy, individuals\ndo not cognize objects but explicate and actualize their being as\nthinkers and thus become  themselves. Consequently, he did not\nattract a cohort of apostles, and, outside Germany at least, his works\nare not often the subject of high philosophical discussion. This is\npartly the result of the fact that the philosophers who now enjoy\nundisputed dominance in modern German philosophical history,\nespecially Martin Heidegger, Georg Lukács and Theodor\nW. Adorno, wrote disparagingly about Jaspers, and they were often\nunwilling to take his work entirely seriously. Another explanation for\nJaspers’s relative marginality relates to problematic nature of the\nEnglish translations of his writings that render his thinking rather\nincommunicable to readers from English speaking countries. To be sure,\nhe was extremely fortunate with his many translators, the most\nprominent of whom are Ralph Manheim and E.B. Ashton. But the\ntranslations often use misleading expression, choose different words\nto express the very same word in the original German, and thus confuse\nthe readers. Also, unindicated omissions and other problems that\nresult from favouring aesthetic considerations over accuracy all\ncontribute to falsifying the original. It has been argued that Jaspers\ncould not appeal to the English-speaking philosophical mind due to\nbeing too speculative and metaphysical or simply beyond the reach of\nthe Anglo-American cultural horizons. To all these factors, one might\nadd the fact of Jaspers’s association with the more prosaic\nperiods of German political life, and of his name being tarred with an\naura of staid bourgeois common sense. Nonetheless, Jaspers’s work set\nthe parameters for a number of different philosophical debates, the\nconsequences of which remain deeply influential in contemporary\nphilosophy, and in recent years there have been signs that a more\nfavourable reconstructive approach to his work is beginning to\nprevail.\n\n\n\nKarl Theodor Jaspers was born on 23rd February 1883 in\nthe North German town of Oldenburg near the North Sea, where his\nancestors had lived for generations. He was the son of a banker and a\nrepresentative of the parliament (Landtagesabgeordneten), Carl Wilhelm\nJaspers (1850–1940) and Henriette Tantzen (1862–1941), who also came\nfrom a family that was involved in local parliament. Jaspers’s family\nmilieu was strongly influenced by the political culture of North German\nliberalism, and he often referred to the climate of early liberal\ndemocratic thought as a formative aspect of his education. Moreover,\nalthough he claimed not to have been influenced by any specifically\necclesiastical faith, his thought was also formed by the spirit of\nNorth German Protestantism, and his philosophical outlook can in many\nrespects be placed in the religiously inflected tradition of Kant and\nKierkegaard. \n\nJaspers was a pupil at the Altes Gymnasium in Oldenburg.\nSince his early childhood, Jaspers suffered from chronic\nbronchiectasis that impaired his physical capabilities and awareness\nof his physical disabilities shaped his routine throughout his adult\nlife and formed his sensitivity to psychological issues, including\nhuman suffering. Jaspers attributed his ability to conduct a\nnormative routine and to devote his life to his creative work to his\nstrict discipline regarding his health. \n\nIn 1910 he married Gertrud Mayer (1879–1974), who came from a\npious German-Jewish merchant family. At the time, she was working as\nan assistant in the sanatorium of the neurologist and psychiatrist\nOskar Kohnstamms (1871–1917) and was the sister of his close\nfriends Gustav Mayer and the philosopher Ernest Mayer. Only thanks to\nher marriage to the already known philosopher Karl Jaspers was Gertrud\nMayer able to stay in Germany during the Nazi period. \n\nJaspers received an extremely diverse and broad-ranging education. He\ninitially enrolled as a student of law at the University of Heidelberg\nfor three semesters. Despite his already vivid interest in philosophy,\nhis decision for medicine was based on his belief that it best\nilluminated life itself and the challenges of human existence. Jaspers\nthen became a student of medicine at Heidelberg from\n1902–1908. He graduated M.D. in 1909.  He was a research\nassistant in the psychiatric clinic of the university of Heidelberg\nfrom 1909–1915, where he worked with some of the most famous\npsychiatrists in Germany, including Nissl, Wilmanned, Gruhle, and\nMayer-Gross. Due to his illness with bronchiectasis, he was incapable\nof carrying out heavy duties in the clinic. The director of the\npsychiatric clinic of the university of Heidelberg, Franz Nissl,\npermitted him to spend the majority of his time at the library rather\nthan in the clinic and the laboratory. Indeed, his extraordinary\nskills of critical thinking and abstract observation on human\nsituations were evident already then. From 1913 onward, Jaspers read\nphilosophy systematically. In 1913 he published his Allgemeine\nPsychopathologie (General Psychopathology) which already\nmade apparent the viewpoints and methods that belong to the world of\nthe humanities and social studies that were regarded by him as\nconverging into psychopathology. In the same year, he obtained his\nsecond doctorate (Habilitation) in psychology from the\nPhilosophy Faculty at the University of Heidelberg, supervised by\nWilhelm Windelband. He was a lecturer and later an Associate Professor\nof Psychology (Privatdozent) from 1913 to 1921. During this\nperiod, in 1919, he published his Psychologie der\nWeltanschauungen (Psychology of World Views). This work\nis considered as a transitional work, in which his psychological\nmethod was clearly shaped by philosophical influences and objectives,\nand was already evolving into a consistent philosophical doctrine and\nacquiring some of the main issues that were to be explored later\nwithin his philosophy of existence. Then, in 1922, he took over the\nfull professorial chair of philosophy in the University of Heidelberg\n(after Heinrich Maier), a position from which he was dismissed in 1937\nby the Nazis. To a large extent, the two first major publications were\nworks of psychology that contain many elements, albeit in inchoate\nform, of his later philosophy.  Following his nomination as professor,\nhe wrote nothing for ten years, except for two small works—a\npatholography Stirnberg and van Gogh in 1922 and Die Idee\nder Universität (The Idea of the University) in 1923. \n\nWhile he was working as a psychiatrist in Heidelberg, Jaspers came\ninto contact with Max Weber, and also with the other intellectuals who\nwere grouped around Weber, including Ernst Bloch, Emil Lask, Georg\nSimmel, and Lukács. His intellectual formation was marked in a\nnumber of ways by this intellectual milieu. At a political level, he\nintegrated aspects of Weber’s enthusiasm for heroic liberalism,\nresponsible nationalism and elite democracy into his own thought and\nattitudes. At a more theoretical level, his ideas were determined by\nthe increasingly critical responses to neo-Kantian philosophy, which\ndominated methodological discussions around Weber and Lukács,\nand which subsequently coloured the intellectual horizon during World\nWar I and throughout the Weimar Republic. This period witnessed the\ndethroning of neo-Kantianism as the philosophical orthodoxy in the\nGerman academic establishment, and it was marked by a proliferation of\nphilosophical models which rejected Kantian formalism and sought to\nintegrate experiential, historical and even sociological elements into\nphilosophical discourse. The attempt to rescue Kantian philosophy from\nthe legalistic formalism of the South West German School of\nneo-Kantian philosophy, centred around Heinrich Rickert and Wilhelm\nWindelband, became one of the central features of Jaspers’s\nwork, and in many ways his entire philosophical evolution was\nmotivated by the desire to reconstruct Kantian thought, not as a\nformalist doctrine of self-legislation, but as an account of\nmetaphysical experience, spontaneously decisive freedom, and authentic\ninner life. His early career as professor of philosophy was also\ndeeply (and adversely) affected by neo-Kantian hostility to his\nwork. Indeed, both neo-Kantians and phenomenological philosophers\nsubjected his work to trenchant criticism in the early stages of his\nphilosophical trajectory, and members of both these camps, especially\nRickert and Edmund Husserl, accused him of importing anthropological\nand experiential questions into philosophy and thus of contaminating\nphilosophical analysis with contents properly pertaining to other\ndisciplines. \n\nIf Weber was the first decisive personal influence and Kant was the\nfirst decisive philosophical influence on Jaspers, in the early 1920s\nhe encountered a further figure who assumed a decisive role in his\nformation: that is, Martin Heidegger. It cannot be claimed without\nqualification that Heidegger directly determined the conceptual\nstructure or underlying preconditions of Jaspers’s work, nor that\nHeidegger assimilated aspects of Jaspers’s thought into his own\nphilosophy. Throughout their theoretical trajectories, the differences\nbetween Heidegger and Jaspers were in many ways greater than the\nsimilarities. Indeed, the theoretical controversies between them\neventually culminated in an embittered personal and political\naltercation, caused by Heidegger’s publicly declared sympathy for the\nNational Socialists in 1933. Jaspers felt himself personally\nthreatened by Heidegger’s infamous decision to support the Nazis, as\nhe was married to a Jewish woman, and he had previously attached\nhimself to eminent liberal politicians and philosophers, most notably\nWeber, who were now vilified by Heidegger and other intellectuals\nattached to the NSDAP. In 1933, Jaspers himself was briefly tempted\ninto making certain incautiously optimistic statements about the\nHitler regime. Indeed, these were remarks were not entirely out of\nkeeping with his other publications of the early 1930s. In the last\nyears of the Weimar Republic he published a controversial political\nwork, Die geistige Situation der Zeit (The Spiritual\nCondition of the Age, 1931), which—to his later acute\nembarrassment—contained a carefully worded critique of\nparliamentary democracy. Throughout this period, he also stressed the\nrelevance of Weberian ideas of strong leadership for the preservation\nof political order in Germany. The souring of his relations with\nHeidegger, however, seems to have hardened his mind into a strict and\nsustained opposition to National Socialism, and, unlike Heidegger, his\nworks of the 1930s avoided political themes and were largely\nconcentrated on elaborating the interior or religious aspects of his\nphilosophy. In 1932, he published his trilogy Philosophie,\nconsisting of three separate volumes, each based on its own object of\ntranscending: Weltorientierung (Orientation of the\nWorld), Existenzerhellung (Illumination of Existence)\nand Metaphysik (Metaphysics). This book is generally\nconsidered as his magnum opus and he testified in retrospect\nthat is was the closest work to his heart. The choice not to grant the\nbook the expected title of “Existential Philosophy”,\ndespite the extensive use of the term\nExistenzphilosophie, reflects his discontent about its\nnarrowing his guiding ideal of Philosophia Perennis. Later in his\nVernunft und Widervernunft in unserer Zeit (Reason and\nAnti-Reason in Our Time), from 1950 he would express his preference for\nthe expression ‘philosophy of reason’. \n\nDespite the at times envenomed relations between them, however,\nHeidegger and Jaspers are usually associated with each other as the two\nfounding fathers of existential philosophy in Germany. This\ninterpretation of their philosophical status and relationship is at\nleast questionable. Heidegger resented being described as an\nexistentialist, and Jaspers, at least after 1933, resented being\nidentified with Heidegger. Even during their early friendship Heidegger\nwas very critical of Jaspers’s philosophy; he wrote a commentary on\nPsychology of World Views, in which he claimed that Jaspers’s\nmethodological approach remained ensnared in the falsehoods of\nsubjectivist metaphysics and Cartesian ontology, and that it\nillegitimately introduced the categories of Weberian sociology into\nphilosophical analysis. Similarly, throughout his life Jaspers kept a\nbook of critical notes on Heidegger, and he routinely described\nHeidegger’s fundamental ontology in a tone of moral-humanistic\ndisapprobation. Nonetheless, there remains a residue of validity in the\ncommon association of Heidegger and Jaspers, and, although it requires\nqualification, this association is not in every respect misleading.\nExistentialism was, and remains, a highly diffuse theoretical movement,\nand it cannot be expected that two philosophers connected with this\nmovement should hold similar views in all respects. However,\nexistentialism had certain unifying features, and many of these were\ncommon to both Jaspers and Heidegger. In the early stages of its\nevolution, therefore, existentialism might be described as a\ntheoretical stance which: a) moved philosophical discourse away from\nKantian formalism and emphasized the belief that the content of thought\nmust reside in particular experiences and decisions; b) followed\nKierkegaard in defining philosophy as a passionate and deeply engaged\nactivity, in which the integrity and the authenticity of the human\nbeing are decisively implicated; c) sought to overcome the antinomies\n(reason/experience; theory/praxis; transcendence/immanence; pure\nreason/practical reason) which determine the classical metaphysical\ntradition by incorporating all aspects (cognitive, practical and\nsensory) of human life in an encompassing account of rational and\nexperiential existence. If this definition of existentialism is\naccepted, then the suggestion of a family connection between Jaspers\nand Heidegger cannot be entirely repudiated, for both contributed to\nthe reorganization of philosophical questioning in the 1920s in a\nmanner which conforms to this definition. Ultimately, however,\nrelations between Heidegger and Jaspers degenerated to a terminal\nimpasse, and after World War II Jaspers refused to explain or exonerate\nHeidegger’s political actions during the Nazi years and he even\nrecommended to a de-Nazification committee that Heidegger should be\nsuspended from his university teaching responsibilities. \n\nDuring the Nazi period from 1933 onwards, Jaspers was excluded from\nany co-operation in the administration of the university until he\nwas dismissed from his chair as a professor in 1937 and was subject to\na publication ban (Publikationsverbot). During the war, he\nand his wife were in no physical danger. Yet he felt himself a marked\nman until the end of World War II. Jaspers once heard indirectly that\nthere was a plan to deport him and his wife to a concentration camp in\nthe middle of April 1945. Fortunately, the American troops arrived in\nHeidelberg two weeks earlier, on April 1st 1945. However,\nafter 1945, his fortunes changed dramatically, and he figured\nprominently on the White List of the US-American occupying forces:\nthat is, on the list of politicians and intellectuals who were deemed\nuntarnished by any association with the NSDAP, and who were allowed to\nplay a public role in the process of German political\nre-foundation. From this time on Jaspers defined himself primarily as\na popular philosopher and educator. In the first role, he contributed\nextensive edifying commentaries on questions of political orientation\nand civic morality—first, in the interim state of\n1945–1949, and then, after 1949, in the early years of the\nFederal Republic of Germany. In the second role, as one of the\nprofessors responsible for reopening the University of Heidelberg, to\nwhich he was appointed by the American Army of Occupation as a\ncontemporary rector, he wrote at length on the necessity of university\nreforms, he emphasized the role of liberal humanistic education as a\nmeans of disseminating democratic ideas throughout Germany, and he\ntook a firm line against the rehabilitation of professors with a\nhistory of Nazi affiliation. In 1946, The Idea of the\nUniversity was published in an essentially different form from\nthe book with the same title from 1923. The later work presents the\nuniversity as a free community of scholars and students engaged in the\ntask of seeking truth. As such, the university and the scholars that\npopulate it can and should play a decisive role in rehabilitation of\nEurope based on the noblest ideas of the enlightenment. At that time\nand still, Jaspers is one of few who can justly speak for value and\nthe need for such a stance against the threats upon freedom and\nhumanity. The acknowledgment of Jaspers’s noble humanism in the first\nyears after the war is apparent in the numerous honors granted to him,\nincluding the Goethe Prize in 1947, the Peace Prize of the German Book\nTrade in 1958, the Erasmus Prize in 1959, and the Prize of the\nFoundation of Oldenburg for Honorary Citizens. \n\nOf his post-1945 publications, therefore, Jaspers’s political\ncontributions are perhaps the most significant. His contribution to\nthe promotion of a democratic civic culture in West Germany at this\ntime was of great importance, and his writings and radio broadcasts\nshaped, in part, the gradually evolving democratic consensus of the\nearly Federal Republic. In Die Schuldfrage (The Question\nof German Guilt, 1946), published at the time of the\nNürnberg trials, he argued that, although not all Germans could\nbe legitimately brought to trial for war crimes, all Germans should\naccept an implicit complicity in the holocaust and only the critical\nself-reflection of all Germans could lead to cultural and political\nrenewal. In the 1950s, he supported the main policies of the\nliberal-conservative governments led by Konrad Adenauer\n(1949–1963), and he particularly endorsed the formation of the\nWestern Alliance, which he saw as a means of protecting the cultural\nresources of Western European culture from their colonization by the\nSoviet Union. Throughout this time, however, the cautiously\nconservative tenor of Jaspers’s political thought was\nprogressively modified by his frequent and at times intense\nintellectual exchanges with Hannah Arendt, who might well be seen as\nthe fourth great influence on his work. Jaspers had been\nArendt’s tutor and supervisor before she emigrated from Germany\nin the 1930s, but the period after 1945 saw something of a role\nreversal in this relationship, which Jaspers seems to have accepted\nquite graciously. Influenced by Arendt’s agonistic\nrepublicanism, he gradually turned against the relatively complacent\nspirit of political and intellectual restoration in the early Federal\nRepublic, and he finally devoted himself to elaborating models of\ncitizenship founded in constitutional rights and legally enshrined\nidentities. In this respect, he can be viewed as an important\nprecursor of Jürgen Habermas, and his works contain an early\nconception of the doctrine later known as\nconstitutional patriotism. His views on German re-unification\nwere also particularly influential; he opposed the dominant outlooks of\nthe time by claiming that the demand for re-unification meant that\nGerman politics remained infected with the damaging traces of old\ngeo-political ideas and ambitions, and it prevented the fundamental\nredirection of German political life. Finally, then, in symbolic\ndemonstration of disgust at the persistence of pernicious political\nattitudes in Germany he relinquished his German citizenship, and,\nhaving earlier moved across the border to University of Basel in 1948,\nhe became a Swiss national. In his last works, he placed himself closer\nto the political left, and he even argued that only a legal revolution\ncould ensure that the German state was organized on the basis of a\nmorally decisive constitution. He died of a stroke in Basel,\nSwitzerland on February 26 1969 at the age of 86. His wife, Gertrud\nJaspers, who served as his amanuensis throughout his entire life as a\nscholar, died in Basel on May 25 1974 at the age of 95. \n\nLess well-known, at least among the world of English-speaking\npsychiatry, is Jaspers’s lasting contribution to the field of\npsychiatry that preceded his philosophical work, and in retrospect\ntranspires as not wholly unrelated it, at least in its common\nguiding spirit. During his distinguished career as a psychiatrist,\nJaspers achieved an outstanding contribution to psychiatric thinking,\nlater called ‘The Heidelberg School’ and led by Kurt Schneider. As a\nyoung man, he authored a number of scientific articles on homesickness\nand crime, on intelligence tests, on hallucinations – all\nillustrated with detailed case histories. Also, Jaspers published\nreports of the mental pathology of Van Gogh and Stirnberg. Among these,\nof special importance are his outstanding article from 1910, in which\nhe introduced his method and fundamental principles regarding ‘mental\nprocesses' and ‘personality development’, and an article on the\nphenomenological method in psychiatry from 1912, which established his\npioneer status as a first commentator on the phenomenological study of\nsubjective experiences at the conscious level. At the age of barely\nthirty, in 1913, while he was working as a physician in the psychiatric\nhospital at Heidelberg, Jaspers published his\nAllgemeine Psychopathologie: Ein Leitfaden für Studierenden,\nÄrzte und Psychologen (General Psychopathology: A Guide for\nStudents, Physicians and Psychologists). The aims of this book were to\nprovide the framework of the scientific field of psychopathology and\nits related facts and approaches, not only for practitioners in this\nfiled but also for interested intellectuals. This framework covers the\nproblems and methods that capture the body of knowledge of the field\nrather than empirical evidence or a system based on a theory. Instead\nof deciding between the different existing approaches of his time, he\nstressed their peculiarity that entails the inherent justifications\nand the way they might complement each other and together portray the\nmany sides of the psychopathological science. The hint of the spirit\nof his existential philosophy, yet to become expressed, is apparent in\nhis declaration in the preface of the book, according to which\n“in psychopathology it is dangerous merely to learn the matter,\nour task is not to ‘learn psychopathology’ but to learn to\nobserve, ask questions, analyze, and think in psychopathological\nterms”. However, despite the very impressive of the achievement\nof the mentioned book, which within the German speaking world was\nrecognized by leading psychiatrists as a monumental achievement in the\nfield, it marked the culmination of Jaspers’s psychiatric\nproductivity. Just two years later, Jaspers moved away forever from\npsychiatric practice and medicine in general, first towards psychology\nand then philosophy. Interestingly, though, Jaspers saw fit to revise\nand expand the text in a few of its several editions. The first\nedition is the shortest. In the second and third editions, there were\nminor changes. The most considerably revised and expanded edition is\nthe fourth, which appeared in 1942. To a large extent, the integration\nof many ideas from his then already mature existential philosophy from\nthe thirties onwards, which more than doubled the scope of the text,\nin fact amount to a new version of the book. Now, the subtitle that\nappeared in the earlier versions was removed and in the preface\nJaspers indicates its high aim of satisfying the demand for knowledge,\nnot only for physicians but for all who make mankind their theme. In\nthis enlarged version of the book, the imprint of Husserl's\ndescriptive psychology is apparent in the attempt to address the inner\nmental experiences of mentally ill people (mainly schizophrenic\npatients) and regard them as indicative of the general phenomena of\nhuman consciousness, i.e.: delusions, modes of ego-consciousness, and\nmodes of emotions. At the same time, the imprint of Wilhelm Dilthey\n(1833–1911) was perceptible in the centrality given to the\ndistinction between ‘understanding psychology’\n(Verstehende Psychologie), which relates to meaningful and\ncomprehensible connections that are inherent in one’s\npersonality and biography, and ‘explaining psychology’\n(Erklärende Psychologie), which focuses on causal\nconnections that are mainly rooted in\n  biology.1] \nJaspers’s declared conviction that the methodological principles\nremain largely unaffected by the increased materials supported his\nefforts to add entire sections to the new versions of the book –\nsections that aptly reveal his philosophical view on the pertinent\nconsiderations in curing mental illness. Notwithstanding this, Jaspers\nopposed the attempts to address existentialist ideas for the sake of\nunderstanding mental illness. For him it is not possible that a human\nbeing as a whole falls ill or alternatively that illness of any kind\ncan cover one's entire being, rather there are always parts that\nremain uninfected with illness or healthy. \n\nIt is worth noting that the appearance of the fourth edition of\nGeneral Psychopathology was enabled despite the publication\nban to which Jaspers was subject since 1938 for his outspoken and\nuncompromising resistance to the Nazis regime and his persistent\nloyalty to his Jewish wife. Probably the same title from 1913 and the\nscientific character, which covered the fact of incorporation of the\nof considerable sections which where imprinted with his philosophical\nthinking, were helpful in this regard. Despite ceasing practicing\npsychiatry, Jaspers retain his interest in psychopathology and was\nfully aware of the developments in the field, in particular regarding\nthe neurological and somatic aspects of mental illness. However, after\nthe fourth edition appeared, five more were printed in the same format\nas the fourth, the latest appearing in 1973. An English translation\nexists for the seventh edition only and was published in 1963 by J.\nHoenig and Miriam Hamilton. For various reasons—starting from\nnot considering the ‘real causes’ of mental illness,\ncontinuing with its loaded style of writing and argumentation, its\nsevere (though inconsistent) criticism of psychoanalysis, which at\nthat time was regarded as indispensable in any consideration of\npsychopathology, and other reasons—the reception of General\nPsychopathology in the English-speaking countries was far from\nenthusiastic, except for the most respectful, and was sometimes even\nhostile. \n\nJaspers’s first intervention in philosophical debate, Psychology\nof World Views, constructed a typology of mental attitudes, which,\nclose to Weber's model of ideal types, was intended to provide an\ninterpretive account of basic psychological dispositions. The\nunderlying argument in this work is that the constitutive fact of human\nmental life is the division between subject and object\n(Subjekt-Objekt-Spaltung). Human psychological\nforms—or world views—are positioned as antinomical moments\nwithin this founding antinomy, and they give distinct paradigmatic\nexpression to the relation between human subjective inclinations and\nfreedoms and the objective phenomena which the subject encounters.\nUnlike Weber, however, Jaspers argued that the construction of world\nviews is not a merely neutral process, to be judged in non-evaluative\nmanner. Instead, all world views contain an element of pathology; they\nincorporate strategies of defensiveness, suppression and subterfuge,\nand they are concentrated around false certainties or spuriously\nobjectivized modes of rationality, into which the human mind withdraws\nin order to obtain security amongst the frighteningly limitless\npossibilities of human existence. World views, in consequence, commonly\ntake the form of objectivized cages (Gehäuse), in which\nexistence hardens itself against contents and experiences which\nthreaten to transcend or unbalance the defensive restrictions which it\nhas placed upon its operations. Although some world views possess an\nunconditioned component, most world views exist as the limits\nof a formed mental apparatus. It is the task of psychological\nintervention, Jaspers thus argued, to guide human existence beyond the\nrestricted antinomies around which it stabilizes itself, and to allow\nit decisively to confront the more authentic possibilities, of\nsubjective and objective life, which it effaces through its normal\nrational dispositions and attitudes. \n\nIn addition to this psychological typology, Jaspers’s analysis of world\nviews also contains a wider critique of human rationality. Most modes\nof rationality, he suggested, are conveniently instrumental or\nideological forms, which serve distinct subjective and objective\nfunctions, and they habitually stand in the way of genuine knowledge.\nAt the same time, however, he also claimed that rationality possesses\ncapacities of communicative integrity and phenomenological\nself-overcoming, and, if authentically exercised, it is able to escape\nits narrowly functional form, to expose itself to new contents beyond\nits limits and antinomies, and to elaborate new and more cognitively\nunified conceptual structures. He therefore indicated that\nformal-epistemological concepts of rationality must be expanded to\nrecognize that experience and committed actions are formative of\nauthentic knowledge, and that reason cannot, in Cartesian manner, be\nmonadically dislocated from its historical, sensory, experiential and\nvoluntaristic foundations. From the outset, therefore, Jaspers's work,\nalthough methodologically marked by Weber, was also indelibly stamped\nby Hegel's philosophy, and it sought to integrate the preconditions of\nHegel's phenomenology into a systematic psychological\ndoctrine. Indeed, at this early stage in his development Jaspers’s\nthought hinged on an existential—or\nKierkegaardian—alteration of Hegelian philosophy. In this, he\ntransposed the dialectical process through which Hegel accounted for\nthe overcoming of cognitive antinomies in the emergence of\nself-consciousness into an analysis of cognitive formation which sees\nthe resolution of reason's antinomies as effected through vital\nexperiences, decisive acts of self-confrontation, or communicative\ntranscendence. \n\nIn this early work, Jaspers introduced several concepts which assumed\ngreat importance for all his work. Most importantly, this work\ncontains a theory of the limit (Grenze). This term designates\nboth the habitual forms and attitudes of the human mental apparatus,\nand the experiences of the mind as it recognizes these attitudes as\nfalsely objectivized moments within its antinomical structure, and as\nit transcends these limits by disposing itself in new ways towards\nitself and its objects. In his early philosophy Jaspers thus ascribed\ncentral status to ‘limit situations’\n(Grenzsituationen). Limit situations are moments, usually\naccompanied by experiences of dread, guilt or acute anxiety, in which\nthe human mind confronts the restrictions and pathological narrowness\nof its existing forms, and allows itself to abandon the securities of\nits limitedness, and so to enter new realm of self-consciousness. In\nconjunction with this, then, this work also contains a theory of the\nunconditioned (das Unbedingte). In this theory,\nJaspers argued that limit situations are unconditioned moments of human\nexistence, in which reason is drawn by intense impulses or imperatives,\nwhich impel it to expose itself to the limits of its consciousness and\nto seek higher or more reflected modes of knowledge. The unconditioned,\na term transported from Kantian doctrines of synthetic regress, is thus\nproposed by Jaspers as a vital impetus in reason, in which reason\nencounters its form as conditioned or limited and desires to transcend\nthe limits of this form. In relation to this, then, Jaspers’s early\npsychological work also introduced, albeit inchoately, the concept of\nexistential communication. In this, he argued that the freedom\nof consciousness to overcome its limits and antinomies can only be\nelaborated through speech: that is, as a process in which consciousness\nis elevated beyond its limits through intensely engaged communication\nwith other persons, and in which committed communication helps to\nsuspend the prejudices and fixed attitudes of consciousness.\nExistentially open consciousness is therefore always communicative, and\nit is only where it abandons its monological structure that\nconsciousness can fully elaborate its existential possibilities. In\nthis early doctrine of communication, Jaspers helped to shape a wider\ncommunicative and intersubjective shift in German philosophy; indeed,\nthe resonances of his existential hermeneutics remained palpable in the\nmuch later works of Hans-Georg Gadamer and Paul Ricoeur. Less\nobviously, however, in this doctrine he also guided early existential\nthinking away from its original association with Kierkegaard and\nNietzsche and, although assimilating Kierkegaardian elements of\ndecisiveness and impassioned commitment, he claimed that Kierkegaard's\ncult of interiority, centred in the speechlessness of inner life, was a\nmiscarried attempt to envision the conditions of human authenticity.\nThe decision for authentic self-overcoming and cognitive unity can only\noccur, he argued, through shared participation in dialogue. \n\nThe major publication of Jaspers’s earlier period, and probably of\nhis entire career, is the three-volume work: Philosophy\n(1932). In this work, he retained the partly Hegelian focus of his\nearlier publications, and he followed the spirit of Hegelian\nphenomenology in providing an account of the formation of human\nconsciousness, which grasps consciousness as proceeding from the level\nof immediate knowledge and progressing through a sequence of antinomies\ntowards a level of truthfully unified reflection and self-knowledge. In\nthis, Jaspers again accentuated the claim that the antinomies which\nreason encounters and resolves in its unfolding as truth are at once\nboth cognitive and experiential antinomies, and that the lived moments\nof human existence are always of cognitively constitutive relevance for\nthe formation of consciousness. These ideas in fact remained central to\nJaspers’s philosophy throughout its subsequent evolution. In his later\nphilosophical works, especially Von der Wahrheit (Of\nTruth, 1947), he continued to give prominence to cognitive models\nderived from Hegelian phenomenology, and he proposed a concept of\nthe encompassing (das Umgreifende) to determine the\nphenomenological gradations of thought and being. However, in addition\nto its concern with Hegelian themes, Philosophy also contains\na fundamental reconstruction of Kantian themes, it has its foundation\nin a critical reconstruction of Kant's doctrine of transcendental\nideas, and it is built around an endeavour to explain the elements of\nKantian idealism as a systematic doctrine of subjective-metaphysical\nexperience. \n\nThe three volumes of Philosophy bear the titles\nPhilosophical World Orientation (volume I), The\nIllumination of Existence (volume II), and Metaphysics\n(volume III). Each volume of this book thus describes a particular way\nof being: orientation, existence and metaphysical\ntranscendence are the three essential existential modalities\nof human life. At the same time, each volume also describes a\nparticular way of knowing, which is correlated with a way of being:\norientation is cognitively determined by objectively verifiable\nknowledge or by positive or scientific proof-forms, existence is\ndetermined by subjective/existential self-reflection, and transcendence\nis determined by the symbolic interpretation of metaphysical contents.\nTogether, the three volumes of Philosophy are designed to show\nhow human existence and human knowledge necessarily progress from one\nlevel of being and one level of knowledge to another, and how\nconsciousness gradually evolves, through confrontation with its own\nantinomies, from an immediate and unformed state towards a condition of\nunity and integral self-experience. The three volumes are consequently\nbound together by the argument that at the level of immediate objective\nknowledge—of orientation in the world—human consciousness\nraises subjective-existential questions about itself and the grounds of\nits truth which it cannot resolve at this level of consciousness, and\nit encounters antinomies which call it to reflect existentially upon\nitself and to elevate it to the level of existence or existentially\ncommitted self-reflection. At this higher level of consciousness, then,\nexistence raises metaphysical questions about itself and its origin\nwhich it cannot begin to answer without an awareness that existence is,\nat an originary or authentic level, transcendent, and that its\ntruth is metaphysical. \n\nEach level of being in Jaspers’s Philosophy corresponds to\none of the Kantian transcendental ideas, and the modes of thinking and\nknowing defining each level of existence elucidate the intellectual\ncontent of Kant's ideas. The level of orientation in the world\ncorresponds to the idea of the unity of the world; the level of\nexistence corresponds to the idea of the soul's immortality; the level\nof transcendence corresponds to the idea of God's necessary existence.\nHowever, whereas Kant saw transcendental ideas as the formal-regulative\nideas of reason, serving, at most, to confer systematic organization on\nreason's immanent operations, Jaspers viewed transcendental ideas as\nrealms of lived knowledge, through which consciousness passes and by\nwhose experienced antinomies it is formed and guided to a knowledge of\nitself as transcendent. Jaspers thus attributed to\ntranscendental ideas a substantial and experiential content. Ideas do\nnot, as for Kant, simply mark the formal limits of knowledge, marking\nout the bounds of sense against speculative or metaphysical questions.\nInstead, ideas provide a constant impulsion for reason to overcome its\nlimits, and to seek an ever more transcendent knowledge of itself, its\ncontents and its possibilities. In his mature philosophy, therefore,\nJaspers transformed the Kantian transcendental ideas into ideas of\ntranscendence, in which consciousness apprehends and elaborates\nthe possibility of substantial or metaphysical knowledge and\nself-knowledge. Central to this adjustment to Kant's conception of\nideas was also an implied, yet quite fundamental critique of the key\nKantian distinction between the transcendent and the transcendental. In\ncontrast to contemporary neo-Kantian readings of Kant, which were\nprepared to acknowledge the ideal element in Kantian idealism only, at\nmost, as a regulative framework, generated by reason's own autonomous\nfunctions, Jaspers argued that Kantian philosophy always at once\ncontains and suppresses a vision of experienced transcendence, and that\nthe Kantian ideas should be viewed as challenges to reason to think\nbeyond the limits of its autonomy, towards new and more authentic\ncontents, self-experiences and freedoms. \n\nIn replacing the transcendental with the transcendent, however,\nJaspers did not argue that transcendent contents are obtainable as\npositive elements of human knowledge. On the contrary, he argued that\nconsciousness only acquires knowledge of its transcendence by\ncontemplating the evanescent ciphers of transcendence, which\nsignify the absolute limits of human consciousness. These ciphers might\nbe encountered in nature, in art, in religious symbolism, or in\nmetaphysical philosophy. But it is characteristic of all ciphers that,\nin alluding to transcendence, they also withhold transcendent knowledge\nfrom consciousness, and that they can only act as indices of the\nimpossibility of such knowledge. The attitude of consciousness which\napprehends its limits and its possible transcendence can therefore only\nbe an attitude of foundering or failing (Scheitern), and\ntranscendence can intrude in human consciousness only as an experience\nof the absolute insufficiency of this consciousness for interpreting\nits originary or metaphysical character. At this level, then, although\nopposing the formality and experiential vacuity of neo-Kantianism,\nJaspers also accepted the original Kantian prohibition on positive\ntranscendent or metaphysical knowledge. He argued that consciousness\nalways has a metaphysical orientation to be other than, or transcendent\nto, its existing forms, but he also claimed that this orientation can\nonly factually culminate in a crisis of transcendence, or in a crisis\nof metaphysics. Although reconsolidating the metaphysical aspects of\nKantian philosophy, therefore, Jaspers’s own metaphysics is always a\npost-Kantian metaphysics: it is a negative metaphysics, which\nresists all suggestion that human reason might give itself an account\nof metaphysical essences, which defines the realm of human meaning as\nformed by its difference against positive metaphysical knowledge, but\nwhich nonetheless sees reason, in Kierkegaardian manner, as driven by a\ndespairing desire for metaphysical transcendence. \n\nJaspers’s metaphysical reconstruction of Kantian idealism has been\ndenounced by other philosophers, most notably those in the broad milieu\nof the Frankfurt School, as a stage in a wider course of cognitive\ndegeneration, which falsely translates absolute metaphysical contents\ninto moments of human inner experience. Despite this, there are good\ngrounds for arguing that Jaspers’s metaphysics is an important critique\nof the fully autonomist accounts of rationality proposed by\nneo-Kantianism, and it even coincides with the critiques of Kantian\nformalism which underpinned the philosophies widely associated with the\nFrankfurt School. Jaspers intuited that Kantian transcendentalism\nsuppressed a deep-lying impulse for transcendence, and this aspect of\nKant's thought was badly neglected by interpreters who saw Kant's\nphilosophy as a doctrine of pure immanence or autonomy. Adorno's later\nargument that Kant's transcendental idealism always contains a lament\nover the closure of reason against transcendence was thus anticipated\nby Jaspers, albeit in subjectivist terms, and Jaspers and\nAdorno—for all their political differences—can be placed\nclose together as thinkers who endeavoured to revitalize the\nmetaphysical traces in idealism. In any case, Jaspers’s insistence,\ncontra Kant and the neo-Kantians, that reason itself is not\nthe sole source of knowledge, and that the task of reason is not\nproscriptively to circumscribe the sphere of its validity against\ntranscendence, but to overcome its cognitive limits and to envision\ncontents which cannot be generated by its own autonomous functions,\ndeserves to be rehabilitated as an abidingly significant contribution\nto modern debates on metaphysics and epistemology. \n\nThe influences of Weber, Kant, Hegel and Kierkegaard are not\ndifficult to discern in Jaspers’s work. Similarly, it is also not\ndifficult to identify the ways in which his work was influenced by\nNietzsche. Jaspers borrowed from Nietzsche a psychologistic approach to\nphilosophical perspectives, and, like Nietzsche, he tended to view\nphilosophical claims, not as formally verifiable postulates, but as\nexpressions of underlying mental dispositions. For this reason, he also\nborrowed from Nietzsche a dismissive approach to absolutized claims to\ntruthful knowledge, and a resultant rejection of all rational purism.\nMost especially, however, like Heidegger, he took from Nietzsche a\ncritical approach to the residues of metaphysics in European\nphilosophy, and he denied the existence of essences which are external\nor indifferent to human experience. At the same time, however, Jaspers\nalso clearly positioned his philosophy against many elements of the\nNietzschean legacy. He was clearly opposed to the naturalistic vitalism\nevolving from Nietzsche's work, and his emphasis on human subjectivity\nas a locus of truthful transcendence meant that Kierkegaard, rather\nthan Nietzsche, was the existential prototype for his work. \n\nOne further important formative influence on Jaspers’s philosophy,\nhowever, was Schelling. Although he was at times critical of the simple\nmysticism and the metaphysics of natural process in Schelling's\nreligious works, his metaphysical reconstruction of Kantian idealism\nrearticulated some elements of the positive philosophy of the later\nSchelling, and it mirrored his attempt to account for truthful\nknowledge as a cognitive experience in which reason is transfigured by\nits encounter with contents other than its own form. In this respect,\nJaspers adopted from Schelling a non-identitarian model of cognitive\nlife, which views true (or truthful) knowledge as obtained through acts\nof positive interpretation and revelation at the limits of rational\nconsciousness. Unlike Schelling, he always rejected claims to absolute\npositive knowledge; to this extent, he remained—in the ultimate\nanalysis—a Kantian philosopher. However, he was clearly\nsympathetic to Schelling's critique of formal epistemological\nnegativism. Indeed, through his hermeneutical transformation of\nidealism into a metaphysics of symbolic interpretation, he might be\nseen, like both Schelling and Johann Georg Hamann before him, as a\nphilosopher who was intent on re-invoking the truth of revelation, as\nan absolute and non-identical content of knowledge, against the\nrational evidences of epistemology, and so on elaborating an\ninterpretive methodology adapted to a conception of truth as disclosed\nor revealed. \n\nThe discrete but important influence of Schelling on Jaspers’s\nphilosophy also provides a clue to understanding Jaspers’s\nphilosophy of religion. At one level, Jaspers was philosophically\ncommitted to a sympathetic retrieval of religious contents. He was\ninsistent that truth can only be interpreted as an element of radical\nalterity in reason, or as reason's experience of its own\nlimits. Similarly, he was insistent that the conditions of human\nfreedom are not generated by human reason alone, but are experienced\nas incursions of transcendence in rational thought. For these reasons,\nhis philosophy is sympathetic towards the primary implications of\nrevelation theology, and it cautiously upholds the essential\nphilosophical claim of revelation: namely, that truth is a disclosure\nof otherness (transcendence) to reason, or at least an interpreted\nmoment of otherness in reason. At the same time, however, Jaspers\ncannot in any obvious way be described as a religious philosopher. In\nfact, he was very critical of revelation theology, and of orthodox\nreligions more generally, on a number of quite separate counts. First,\nhe argued that the centre of religion is always formed by a falsely\nobjectivized or absolutized claim to truth, which fails to recognize\nthat transcendence occurs in many ways, and that transcendent truths\ncannot be made concrete as a set of factual statements or\nnarratives. Religious world views are therefore examples of limited\nmental attitudes, which seek a hold in uniform doctrine in order to\nevade a confrontation with the uncertainty and instability of\ntranscendence. In positing transcendence as a realized element of\nrevelation, religion in fact obstructs the capacity for transcendence\nwhich all people possess; religion claims to offer transcendence, but\nit actually obstructs it. Second, then, as the foundations of dogma\nand doctrinal orthodoxy, revealed truth-claims eliminate the\nself-critical and communicative aspect of human reason, and they\nundermine the dialogical preconditions of transcendence and\nexistential self-knowledge. Jaspers thus viewed orthodox religion as\nan obstruction to communication, which places dogmatic limits on the\ncommon human capacity for truthfulness and transcendence. Nonetheless,\nas a philosopher of transcendence, he was also clear that human\ntruthfulness, or humanity more generally, cannot be conceived without\na recuperation of religious interpretive approaches and without a\nrecognition of the fact that the founding contents of philosophy are\ntranscendent. Much of his work, in consequence, might be construed as\nan attempt to free the contents of religious thinking from the\ndogmatic orthodoxies imposed upon these contents in the name of\norganized religion. \n\nThe central idea in Jaspers’s philosophy of religion is the\nconcept of philosophical faith, set out most extensively\nin Der Philosophische Glaube (Philosophical Faith,\n1948) and Der Philophische Glaube angesichts der christlichen\nOffenbarung (Philosophical Faith in face of Christian\nRevelation, 1962). This notoriously difficult concept contains a\nnumber of quite distinct meanings. First, it means that true\nphilosophy must be guided by a faith in the originary transcendence of\nhuman existence, and that philosophy which negatively excludes or\nignores its transcendent origin falls short of the highest tasks of\nphilosophy. Second, however, it also means that true philosophy\ncannot simply abandon philosophical rationality for positively\ndisclosed truth-contents or dogma, and that the critical function of\nrationality has a constitutive role in the formation of absolute\nknowledge. In this respect, Jaspers revisited some of the\ncontroversies concerning the relation between religion and philosophy\nwhich shaped the philosophy of the Young Hegelians in the 1830s. Like\nthe Young Hegelians, he insisted that faith needs philosophy, and\nfaith devalues its contents wherever these are dogmatically or\npositively proclaimed. Third, then, this concept also indicates that\nthe evidences of faith are always paradoxical and uncertain and that\nthose who pursue knowledge of these contents must accept an attitude\nof philosophical relativism and discursive exchange: if faith results\nin dogmatism, it immediately undermines its claims to offer\ntranscendent knowledge. The concept of philosophical faith is thus\nproposed, not as a doctrine of factual revelation or accomplished\ntranscendence, but as a guide to transcendent communication, which\nbalances the element of disclosure in faith with a critical\nphilosophical veto on the absolutism of religious claims, and which\nconsequently insists that transcendent knowledge must be accepted as\nrelative and incomplete. In this regard, Jaspers held the religious\naspects of his philosophy on a fine dialectic between theological and\nanthropological assertions. He implied, at one level, that purely\nsecularist accounts of human life occlude existence against its\noriginary transcendent possibilities and freedoms. At the same time,\nhowever, he also suggested that pure theological analysis closes\nhumanity against the relativity and precariousness of its truths, and\nagainst the communicative processes through which these truths are\ndisclosed. Only philosophy which can at once embrace and relativize\nsecularism and embrace and relativize religion is able to undertake\nadequate existential inquiry, and philosophy which, in either\ndirection, abandons the dialectical edge between these two commitments\nceases to be genuine philosophy. \n\nThis critical-recuperative attitude towards religious inquiry was\nfundamental to many of the public controversies in which Jaspers\nengaged. The religious elements of his work came under attack from the\nCalvinist theologian, Karl Barth, who denounced the lack of objective\nreligious content in his concept of transcendence. More significantly,\nthough, Jaspers also entered into a lengthy and influential\ncontroversy with Rudolf Bultmann, the resonances of which still impact\non liberal theological debate. At the centre of this debate was\nJaspers’s critique of Bultmann's strategy of\nscriptural de-mythologization: that is, his attempt to\nclarify the truth-contents of the scriptures by eliminating the\nhistorical or mythological elements of the New Testament, and by\nconcentrating, in an existentially intonated exegesis, on the\nperennially valid and present aspects of the Bible. At the time when\nBultmann first proposed this de-mythologizing approach Jaspers was\nwidely (although erroneously) identified with the liberal wing of\nProtestant theology, and it was perhaps expected that he might declare\nsympathy for Bultmann's hermeneutical approach. Jaspers, however,\nturned sharply on Bultmann. He accused him, first, of propagating a\nfalse rationalism in religious debate; second, of arbitrarily\ndismissing the manifestations, embedded in myth, of the spiritual\nexperiences of those living in earlier historical époques; and,\nthird, of aligning all transcendent experiences to a standard scheme\nof relative value, and so of imposing a new system of orthodoxy in\ntheology and undermining the manifold possibilities of\ntranscendence. In opposition to Bultmann, therefore, Jaspers concluded\nthat only a religious hermeneutic based in absolute\nliberality, excluding all orthodoxy, could be appropriate to\nthe task of interpreting the transcendent contents of human life.\nInterpretive methods which efface the traces of historical contingency\nfrom transcendence and reduce transcendence to one predetermined\nreligious truth, he suggested, fail to reflect on the plural and\nvarious forms in which transcendence can be interpreted, they\nerroneously presuppose that transcendence can be encased in the\ncategories of one exclusive doctrine, and they undervalue the\nconstitutive historical variability of transcendence. As a consequence,\nJaspers argued implicitly for the importance of mythical or symbolic\nforms in religious inquiry, and he indicated that both myth and\nreligion contain, in similar measure, the interpreted residues of\ntranscendence. His analysis of religion culminated in a discussion of\nTrinitarian theology which, echoing Ludwig Feuerbach's anthropological\nanalysis, asserted that the three parts of the trinity should be\ninterpreted, not as factual elements of deity, but as symbolic ciphers\nof human possibility. In this, he ascribed particular significance to\nthe second person of the Trinity, Jesus Christ, as a cipher for the\nhuman existential possibility of inner change, reversal and\ntransformation. Wherever this cipher is hypostatically defined as mere\npositive fact of belief, he concluded however, the freedom of\ntranscendence obtained through the sympathetic interpretation and\nrecuperation of this cipher is obstructed. \n\nUnderlying Jaspers’s interest in religion was a determination to\nconvert the elements of religious doctrine into an account of human\npossibilities and freedoms. Indeed, the ambition behind his work on\nreligion and myth was no less than to liberate transcendence from\ntheology, and to permit an interpretive transformation of religiously\nconceived essences into the free moments of human self-interpretation.\nIf his thought can truly be placed in the terrain of theological\ndiscourse, therefore, his approach to religion is one of extreme\nliberalism and latitudinarianism, which dismisses the claim that\ntranscendence is exclusively or even predominantly disclosed by\nreligion. The truth of religion, he intimated, only becomes true if it\nis interpreted as a human truth, not as a truth originally external or\nprior to humanity. In its orthodox form, however, religion normally\nprevents the knowledge of transcendence which it purports to\noffer. \n\nThese humanistic reflections on the philosophy of religion are not\nisolated components of Jaspers’s work. In fact, his criticism of\nreligious dogmatism evolved in conjunction with a wider doctrine of\nhumanism, which ultimately became the defining component of his later\nwork. Arguably, Jaspers was always a humanist; certainly, if humanism\nis defined as a doctrine which seeks to account for the specificity,\nuniqueness and dignity of human life his work can, from the outset, be\nseen as a variant on philosophical humanism. The argument runs through\nall his early works that human beings are distinguished by the fact\nthat they have authentic attributes of existence and\ntranscendence—that is, by their ability to raise questions about\nthemselves and their freedoms which cannot be posed in material or\nscientific terms, and by their resultant capacity for decisive\nreversal, self-transformation and transcendence. True humanity is thus\na condition of free self-possession and transcendent authenticity. In\ngeneral terms, existentialism can be divided between philosophers,\nsuch as Jean-Paul Sartre, who defined existentialism as a humanism,\nand those, such as Heidegger, who saw the organization of philosophy\naround the analysis of human determinacy as a metaphysical corruption\nof philosophy. Jaspers clearly belonged to the first category of\nexistential philosophers. \n\nIn his writings after 1945, most especially in Vom\nUrsprung und Ziel der Geschichte (The Origin and Goal of\nHistory, 1949) and Die Atombombe und die Zukunft des\nMenschen (The Atom Bomb and the Future of Mankind, 1961),\nJaspers structured his work quite explicitly as a humanist doctrine.\nFrom this time on, moreover, he attached greater importance to the\nsocial and collective conditions of human integrity and he tended to\ntone down his earlier construction of interiority as the place of human\nfreedom. In fact, even the term Existenz became increasingly\nscarce in his post-1945 publications, and it was replaced, to a large\nextent, by ideas of shared humanity, founded, not in the decisive\nexperiences of inner transformation, but in the resources of culture,\ntradition and ethically modulated political life. Central to these\nlater works, consequently, was not only a turn towards humanistic\nreflection, but also an inquiry into the politics of humanism and the\ndistinctively human preconditions of political existence. \n\nBroadly reconstructed, in his later political work he argued that the\nemergence of European totalitarianism—exemplified by both\nNational Socialism and Communism—was the result of a decline in\npolitical humanity and of an increasing primacy of modes of technical\nor instrumental rationality, which erode the authentic resources of\nhuman life. He therefore sought to offer an account of a human polity,\nable to provide an enduring bastion against totalitarian inhumanity.\nFirst, he argued, the human polity must be sustained by an integral\ncultural tradition, so that human beings can interpret the ciphers of\ntheir integrity in the ethical contents of a national culture. The\npolitical betrayal of humanity, he suggested, is usually flanked by,\nand in fact presupposes, a cultural betrayal of humanity, and\ntotalitarian governance normally arises from the erosion or\ninstrumental subjection of culture. In the nineteenth century Marx had\nargued that the reactionary malaise of German politics was caused by\nthe fact that German society habitually allowed culture to stand in\nfor politics and defined the relatively de-politicized educated\nbourgeois elite [Bildungsbürgertum] as the pillar of\nsocial order and the arbiter of progress. Jaspers responded to this\ncharacterization of Germany by claiming that societies which undermine\nthe cultural role of the bourgeois elite are inherently unstable, and\nthat the educated bourgeoisie has a primary role to play in upholding\nthe preconditions of democratic culture. Second, he argued that the\nhuman polity must be based in free communication between citizens:\ncommunicative freedom is a prerequisite of public virtue. The human\npolity, he thus implied, is likely to be some kind of democracy, based\nin some degree of publicly formed consensus. Like Arendt, in fact, he\nconcluded that social atomization creates cultures in which\ntotalitarianism is likely to flourish, and that only unregulated\ndebate in the public sphere can offset this latent pathology of mass\nsociety. Third, he argued that the resources of technological,\nscientific and economic planning employed by the political system\nshould be kept at a minimum, and that the existence of an unplanned\nsphere of human interaction is necessary for the maintenance of a\nhuman political order. In this respect, he fervently opposed all\ntendencies towards technocratic governance, which he identified both\nin the Communist bloc in Eastern Europe, and in the rapidly expanding\nwelfare state of the Federal Republic under Adenauer. Technocracy, he\nasserted, is the objective form of the instrumental tendencies in\nhuman reason, and if it is not counterbalanced by the integrally human\nresources of cultural or rational communication it is likely to result\nin oppressive government. In this respect, he moved close to quite\nstandard variants on political liberalism, and he endorsed limited\ngovernment, relative cultural and economic freedom, and protection for\nsociety from unaccountable political direction. Fourth, he also\nargued that a human polity requires a constitutional apparatus,\nenshrining basic rights, imposing moral-legal order on the operations\nof the state, and restricting the prerogative powers of the political\napparatus. Like Kant, therefore, he advocated the institution of an\ninternational federation of states, with shared constitutions, laws\nand international courts. Fifth, however, he also retained aspects of\nthe elite-democratic outlook which he had first inherited from Weber,\nand he continued to argue that the human polity must be supported and\nguided by reasonable persons or responsible elites. \n\nAfter the traumas of National Socialism and the war, however, it is\nfair to say that Jaspers’s political philosophy never moved\nfinally beyond a sceptical attitude towards pure democracy, and his\npolitical writings never fully renounced the sense that German society\nwas not sufficiently evolved to support a democracy, and Germans\nrequired education and guidance for democracy to take hold. Even in\nhis last writings of the 1960s, in which he declared tentative support\nfor the activities of the student movement around 1968, there remain\ntraces of elite-democratic sympathy. For all his importance in modern\nGerman politics, therefore, his philosophy of politics was always\nslightly anachronistic, and his position remained embedded in the\npersonalistic ideals of statehood which characterized the old-liberal\npolitical culture of Imperial Germany and persisted in the\nconservative-liberal fringes of the Weimar Republic. \n\nJaspers left unfinished Die Großen Philosophen, whose\ndeclared aim was “promoting the happiness that comes of meeting\ngreat men and sharing in their thoughts”, and employed his\npersonal method of constant questioning and struggle. This is a\nmonumental project of universal history of philosophy, whose creators\nwere the outstanding philosophers who inspired the human\nthought. Jaspers, who believed that only through communication with\nothers can we come to ourselves and to wisdom, regarded the\nphilosophers he discusses in this book as his “eternal\ncontemporaries” and “the disturbers” in the sense of\nthinkers for whom doubt and despair loomed large. The first two\nvolumes of this work appeared in 1958, while the third and fourth have\nbeen gathered from the vast material of his posthumous papers. The\neditors Ermarth and Ehrlich have, however, been able to stitch\ntogether a coherent book that, in accordance with Jaspers’s\nplan, primarily covers the philosophers whom he termed “the\ndisturbers”: thinkers for whom doubt and despair loomed\nlarge. The English translations were by Ralf Manheim and edited by\nHannah Arendt, and appeared in parts until 1994. \n\nThe Heidelberg Academy (“Heidelberger Forum Edition”) and\nthe academy of sciences in Göttingen initiated a project of\ngathering in one standard edition the unconnected variety of\ndistinguished editions, commentaries, and translations of the writings\nof Karl Jaspers. The project is chaired by Otfried Höffe,\ntogether with the editors Thomas Fuchs, Jens Halfwassen, and Reinhard\nSchulz, with the cooperation of Anton Hügli, Kurt Salamun, und\nHans Saner. The planned project consists of three major divisions,\naltogether comprising 50 volumes: works (I. 1–27), estate (II. 1–11),\nand letters (III. 1–12). While the first division covers all the works\nthat were printed and published during Jaspers’s lifetime, the\nsecond and the third encompass selections from the vast material of\nhis posthumous papers, some already published and others that have\nnever appeared. The set’s general objective is reviving the\ninvestigation of the philosophical, contemporary, and cultural\npreconditions for Jaspers’s thinking, and also tracing the\nhistory of his impact. The work on this edition at the Universities of\nHeidelberg and Oldenburg is projected to take 18 years and is the\nfruit of cooperation with the Karl Jaspers Foundation in Basel. The\neditors will have recourse to the unpublished writings kept at the\nGerman Literary Archives in Marbach and the 11,000 volumes of the\nJaspers Research Library in the future Karl Jaspers House in\nOldenburg. Over and above the commentary itself, the edition is\ndesigned to provide new impulses for research on the philosopher and\nto enable the debates on present-day cultural and political issues to\nprofit from a species of thinking that can be described as\ninterdisciplinary and cosmopolitan in the best sense of those\nterms.
