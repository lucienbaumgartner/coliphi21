His activity is set in the\nvery crucial period of late Scholasticism, when the new ideas and\ndoctrines there propounded accelerated the transition to the modern\nway of thought. On the one hand, he led a movement of opposition to\nthe medieval Church and to some of its dogmas and institutions, and\nwas a forerunner of the Reformation; on the other, he was also the\nmost prominent English philosopher of the second half of the\n14th century. His logical and ontological theories are, at\nthe same time, the final result of the preceding realistic tradition\nof thought and the starting-point of the new forms of realism at the\nend of the Middle Ages, since many authors active during the last\ndecades of the 14th and the first decades of the\n15th centuries (Robert Alyngton, William Penbygull,\nJohannes Sharpe, William Milverley, Roger Whelpdale, John Tarteys, and\nPaul of Venice), were heavily influenced by his metaphysics and\nlargely used his logical apparatus. However, his philosophical system,\nrigorous in its general design, contains unclear and aporetic points\nthat his followers attempted to remove. Although an influential\nthinker, Wyclif pointed to the strategy the Realists at the\nend of the Middle Ages were to adopt, rather than fully developed\nit.\n\nJohn Wyclif was born near Richmond (Yorkshire) before 1330 and\nordained in 1351. He spent the greater part of his life in the schools\nat Oxford: he was fellow of Merton in 1356, master of arts at Balliol\nin 1360, and doctor of divinity in 1372. He definitely left Oxford in\n1381 for Lutterworth (Leicestershire), where he died on 31 December,\n1384. It was not until 1374 (when he went on a diplomatic mission to\nBruges) that Wyclif entered the royal service, but his connection with\nJohn of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, probably dates back to 1371. His\nideas on lordship and church wealth, expressed in De civili\ndominio (On Civil Dominion), caused his first official\ncondemnation in 1377 by the Pope (Gregory XI), who censured nineteen\narticles. As has been pointed out (Leff 1967), in 1377–78 Wyclif\nmade a swift progression from unqualified fundamentalism to a\nheretical view of the Church and its Sacraments. He clearly claimed\nthe supremacy of the king over the priesthood (see for instance his\nDe ecclesia [On the Church], between early 1378 and\nearly 1379), and the simultaneous presence in the Eucharist of the\nsubstance of the bread and the body of Christ (De eucharistia\n[On the Eucharist], and De apostasia [On\nApostasy], both ca. 1380). His theses would influence Jan Hus and\nJerome of Prague in the 15th century. So long as he limited\nhis attack to abuses and the wealth of the Church, he could rely on\nthe support of a (more or less extended) part of the clergy and\naristocracy, but once he dismissed the traditional doctrine of\ntransubstantiation, his (unorthodox) theses could not be defended any\nmore. Thus in 1382 Archbishop Courtenay had twenty-four propositions\nthat were attributed to Wyclif condemned by a council of theologians,\nand could force Wyclif’s followers at Oxford University to\nretract their views or flee. The Council of Constance (1414–18)\ncondemned Wyclif’s writings and ordered his books burned and his\nbody removed from consecrated ground. This last order, confirmed by\nPope Martin V, was carried out in 1428. \nThe most complete biographical study of Wyclif is still the monograph\nof Workman 1926, but the best analysis of his intellectual development\nand of the philosophical and theological context of his ideas is\nRobson 1961. \nWyclif produced a very large body of work, both in Latin and English,\na great portion of which has been edited by the Wyclif Society between\nthe end of the 19th and the beginning of the\n20th centuries, even though some of his most important\nbooks are still unpublished — for instance, his treatises on\ntime (De tempore) and on divine ideas (De ideis). W.\nR. Thomson 1983 wrote a full bibliography of Wyclif’s Latin\nwritings, among which the following can be mentioned: De\nlogica (On Logic — ca. 1360); Continuatio\nlogicae (Continuation of [the Treatise on] Logic —\ndate of composition: about 1360–63 according to Thomson 1983,\nbut between 1371 and 1374 according to Mueller 1985); De ente in\ncommuni (On Universal Being — ca. 1365); De\nente primo in communi (On Primary Being — ca.\n1365); De actibus animae (On the Acts of Soul\n– ca. 1365); Purgans errores circa universalia in\ncommuni (Amending Errors about Universals —\nbetween 1366 and 1368); De ente praedicamentali (On\nCategorial Being — ca. 1369); De intelleccione Dei\n(On the Intellection of God – ca. 1370); De\nvolucione Dei (On the Volition of God – ca. 1370);\nTractatus de universalibus (Treatise on Universals\n— ca. 1368–69 according to Thomson 1983, but between 1373\nand 1374 according to Mueller 1985); De materia et forma\n(On matter and form — between late 1370 and early 1372\naccording to Thomson 1983, but about 1374–75 according to\nMueller 1985). Many of these treatises were later arranged as a\nSumma, called Summa de ente (Summa on\nBeing), in two books, containing seven and six treatises\nrespectively. (On the genesis, nature, structure, and tasks of this\nwork see Robson 1961, pp. 115–40.) \nLate medieval Nominalists, like Ockham and his followers, drew a\ndistinction between things as they exist in the extra-mental world and\nthe schemata by means of which we think of and talk about them. While\nthe world consists only of two genera of individuals, substances and\nqualities, the concepts by which they are grasped and expressed are\nuniversal and of ten different types. Nor do the relations through\nwhich we connect our notions in a proposition analytically correspond\nto the real links that join individuals in a state of affairs. Thus,\nour conceptual forms do not coincide with the elements and structures\nof reality, and our knowledge does not reproduce its objects but\nmerely regards them. \nWyclif maintained that such an approach to philosophical questions was\nmisleading and deleterious. Many times in his works he expressed the\ndeepest hostility to such a tendency. He thought that only on the\nbasis of a close isomorphism between language and the world could the\nsignifying power of terms and statements, the possibility of\ndefinitions, and finally the validity and universality of our\nknowledge be explained and ensured. So the nucleus of his metaphysics\nlies in his trust in the scheme object-label as the\ngeneral interpretative key of every logico-epistemological problem. He\nfirmly believed that language was an ordered collection of signs, each\nreferring to one of the constitutive elements of reality, and that\ntrue (linguistic) propositions were like pictures of those\nelements’ inner structures or/and mutual relationships. From\nthis point of view, universals are conceived of as the real essences\ncommon to many individual things, which are necessary conditions for\nour language to be significant. Wyclif thought that by associating\ncommon terms with such universal realities the fact could be accounted\nfor that each common term can stand for many things at once and can\nlabel all of them in the same way. \nThis conviction explains the main characteristic of his philosophical\nstyle, to which all his contributions can be traced back: a strong\npropensity towards hypostatisation. Wyclif methodically replaces\nlogical and epistemological rules with ontological criteria and\nreferences. He thought of logic as turning on structural forms,\nindependent of both their semantic contents and the mental acts by\nwhich they are grasped. It is through these forms that the network\nconnecting the basic constituents of the world (individuals and\nuniversals, substances and accidents, concrete properties, like\nbeing-white, and abstract forms, like whiteness) is disclosed to us.\nHis peculiar analysis of predication and his own formulation of the\nScotistic formal distinction are logically necessary requirements of\nthis philosophical approach. They are two absolute novelties in late\nmedieval philosophy, and certainly the most important of\nWyclif’s contributions to the thought of his times. \nWyclif’s last formulation of the theory of difference and his\ntheory of universals and predication are linked together, and rest\nupon a sort of componential analysis where things substitute for\nlexemes and ontological properties substitute for semantic features.\nWithin Wyclif’s world, difference (or distinction) is defined in\nterms of partial identity, and is the main kind of transcendental\nrelation holding among the world’s objects, since in virtue of\nits metaphysical composition everything is at the same time partially\nidentical to and different from any other. When the objects at issue\nare categorial items, and among what differentiates them is their own\nindividual being, the objects differ essentially. If the\nobjects share the same individual being and what differentiates them\nis (at least) one of their concrete metaphysical components\n(or features), then the objects differ really, whereas if\nwhat differentiates them is one of their abstract\nmetaphysical components, then they differ formally. Formal\ndistinction is therefore the tool by means of which the dialectic of\none-many internal to the world’s objects is regulated. It\nexplains why one and the same thing is at the same time an atomic\nstate of affairs and how many different beings can constitute just one\nthing. \nWyclif explains the notion of formal distinction (or difference) in\nthe Purgans errores circa universalia in communi (chap. 4, p.\n38) and in the later Tractatus de universalibus. (On\nWyclif’s formulation of the formal distinction see Spade 1985,\npp. xx-xxxi, and Conti 1997, pp. 158–63.) The two versions\ndiffer from each other on some important points, and are both\nunsatisfactory, since Wyclif’s definitions of the different\ntypes of distinction are rather ambiguous. \nIn the Tractatus de universalibus (chap. 4, pp. 90–92),\nWyclif lists three main kinds of differences (or distinctions): \nHe does not define the real-and-essential difference, but identifies\nit through a rough account of its three sub-types. The things that\ndiffer really-and-essentially are those that differ from each other\neither (i) in genus, like man and quantity, or (ii) in species, like\nman and donkey, or (iii) in number, like two human beings. \nThe real-but-not-essential difference is more subtle than the first\nkind, since it holds between things that are the same single essence\nbut really differ from each other nevertheless — like memory,\nreason, and will, which are one and the same soul, and the three\nPersons of the Holy Trinity, who are the one and same God. \nThe third main kind of difference is the formal one. It is described\nas the difference by which things differ from each other even though\nthey are constitutive elements of the same single essence or supposit.\nAccording to Wyclif, this is the case for: \nThis account of the various kinds of distinctions is more detailed\nthan that of the Purgans errores circa universalia in\ncommuni, but not more clear. What is the difference, for\ninstance, between the definition of the real-but-not-essential\ndistinction and the definition of the formal distinction? What feature\ndo all the kinds of formal distinction agree in? Some points are\nobvious, however: \nThe main apparent dissimilarities between the analyses proposed in the\nTractatus de universalibus and in the Purgans errores\ncirca universalia in communi are the following: \nWyclif presents his opinion on universals as intermediate between\nthose ones of St. Thomas (and Giles of Rome) and Walter Burley. Like\nGiles, whom he quotes by name, Wyclif recognizes three main kinds of\nuniversals: \nThe ideas in God are the causes of the formal universals, and the\nformal universals are the causes of the intentional universals. On the\nother hand, like Burley, Wyclif holds that formal universals exist\nin actu outside our minds, not in potentia as\nmoderate Realists thought — even though, unlike Burley, he\nmaintains they are really identical with their own individuals. So\nWyclif accepts the traditional realistic account of the relationship\nbetween universals and individuals, but translates it into the terms\nof his own system. According to him, universals and individuals are\nreally the same, but formally distinct, since they\nshare the same empirical reality (that of individuals) but, considered\nas universals and individuals, they have opposite constituent\nprinciples. On the logical side, this means that, notwithstanding real\nidentity, not all that is predicated of individuals can be\ndirectly predicated of universals or vice versa,\nthough an indirect predication is always possible. Hence\nWyclif’s description of the logical structure of the\nrelationship between universals and individuals demanded the\nintroduction of a new kind of predication, unknown to Aristotle, to\ncover cases, admitted by the theory, of indirect inherence of an\naccidental form in a substantial universal and of one second intention\nin another. \nTherefore Wyclif distinguished three main types of predication, which\nhe conceived as a real relation that holds between metaphysical\nentities. (On Wyclif’s theory of predication, see Spade 1985,\npp. xxxi-xli, and Conti 1997, pp. 150-58.) \nIn the Purgans errores circa universalia in communi (chap.\n2), the three main types of predication are the following: formal\npredication, essential predication, and causal predication. In the\nTractatus de universalibus (chap. 1, pp. 28–37), causal\npredication has been replaced by habitudinal predication — a\nkind of predication that Wyclif had already recognized in the\nPurgans errores circa universalia in communi, but whose\nposition within the main division of types of predication was not\nclear. In the Tractatus de universalibus, formal predication,\nessential predication, and habitudinal predication are described as\nthree non-exclusive ways of predicating, each more general than the\npreceding. We speak of causal predication when the form designated by\nthe predicate term is not present in the entity signified by the\nsubject term, but is something caused by that entity. No instances of\nthis kind of predication are given by Wyclif. Formal predication,\nessential predication, and habitudinal predication are defined in\nalmost the same way in the Purgans errores circa universalia\nand in the Tractatus de universalibus. \nFormal predication is that in which the form designated by the\npredicate term is directly present in the entity signified by the\nsubject term. This happens whenever an item in the categorial line is\npredicated of something inferior, or an accident is predicated of its\nsubject of inherence. In fact, in both cases, the subject term and the\npredicate term refer to the same reality in virtue of the form\nconnoted by the predicate term itself. \nTo speak of essential predication, it is sufficient that the same\nempirical reality is both the real subject and the predicate, even\nthough the formal principle connoted by the predicate term differs\nfrom that connoted by the subject term. ‘God is man’ and\n‘The universal is particular’ are instances of this kind\nof predication. In fact, the same empirical reality (or essence) that\nis a universal is also an individual, but the forms connoted by the\nsubject term and by the predicate term differ from each other. \nFinally we speak of habitudinal predication when the form connoted by\nthe predicate term does not inhere, either directly or indirectly, in\nthe essence designated by the subject, but simply implies a relation\nto it, so that the same predicate may be at different times truly or\nfalsely spoken of its subject without there being any change in the\nsubject itself. According to Wyclif, we use such a kind of predication\nmainly when we want to express theological truths, like: God is known\nand loved by many creatures, and brings about, as efficient, exemplar,\nand final cause, many good effects. It is evident that habitudinal\npredication does not require any kind of identity between the entity\nsignified by the subject term and the entity signified by the\npredicate term, but formal predication and essential predication do.\nSo the ontological presuppositions of the most general type of\npredication, implied by the other types, are completely different from\nthose of the other two. \nThe final result of Wyclif’s revolution is therefore an\nincomplete system of intensional logic, which he superimposes on the\nstandard extensional system inherited from Aristotle. As a result, the\ncopula of the philosophical propositions that are dealt with cannot be\nextensionally interpreted, since it does not properly mean that a\ngiven object is a member of a certain set or that a given set is\nincluded in another; rather it means degrees of identity. Only in\nvirtue of renouncing any extensional approach to the matter were\nWyclif’s followers able to give a logically satisfactory\nsolution of the problem of the relationship between universals and\nindividuals, which had always been the most difficult issue for\nmedieval Realists. \nThe relationship between thought and reality was a focal point of\nWyclif’s reflection. On the one hand, Wyclif believed that\nthought was linguistically constrained by its own nature; on the other\nhand, he considered thought to be related to reality in its elements\nand constitution. Hence he deemed language, thought, and external\nreality to be of the same logical coherence (see Conti 2006, pp.\n114–18, and Spruyt 2008, pp. 24–25). Within this context,\nthe theory of supposition was intended to explain the different roles\nthat words (or phrases) can have in relation to language and the\nextra-mental world when they appear as extremes (that is, as subject\nor predicate) in propositions. Characteristically, his theory of\nsupposition provides an account not only of the truth-values of a\nsentence, but also of its meaning; it is not therefore simply a theory\nof reference, but a sort of complex analysis of language viewed as a\nsemiotic system whose unique interpretative model was the reality\nitself. It gives clear evidence of Wyclif’s realist choice and\nof his conviction that any kind of linguistic and semantic features\nmust be grounded on ontological structures. \nIn what follows, I shall consider the most important aspects of\nWyclif’s theory of supposition, trying to set it in relation to\nthe medieval tradition of treatises on signification and supposition\nand particularly to its main source, the theory expounded by Walter\nBurley in his De puritate artis logicae tractatus longior\n(composed between 1325 and 1328), which contains an original and\nintelligent defence of the old view of signification and simple\nsupposition against Ockham’s attacks. \nWyclif defines supposition as the signification of one categorematic\nextreme of a proposition (subject or predicate) in relation to the\nother extreme (De logica, chap. 12, vol. I, p. 39). This\ndefinition, which is drawn from Burley’s De\nsuppositionibus (composed in 1302), sounds partially different\nfrom the standard definition of supposition, as it seems to somehow\nequate signification and supposition, since supposition is considered\nas a particular kind of signification. On the contrary, according to\nthe most common view, which went back to Peter of Spain’s\nSummulae logicales, signification and supposition of terms\nwere clearly distinct functions, inasmuch as the latter presupposed\nthe former, but it was a proprietas terminorum (a term\nproperty) totally different from it. In fact, (1) signification\nconsisted in the relation of a linguistic sign to what it signifies\napart from any propositional context; (2) a word capable of standing\nfor something else or for itself in a proposition had first to have\nsignification; (3) a term only had supposition in a propositional\ncontext; and (4) the kind of supposition a term had depended on its\npropositional context. In any case, in a traditional realist\nperspective, supposition served to tell us which things are involved\nin the truth-conditions of a given sentence: whether they are\nexpressions, real universals, or individuals. \nAt the very beginning of the chapter on supposition, like Walter\nBurley, Wyclif divides supposition into improper, in which a term\nstands for something different from its primary significatum by\nspecial custom (ex usu loquendi), and proper, in which a term\nstands for something by the virtue of the expression itself. So a term\nhas improper supposition when it is used in a figurative speech. It is\nthe case of the term ‘cup’ in the sentence ‘I have\ndrunk a cup <of wine>’. Wyclif divides proper supposition\ninto material, when the term stand for itself or its sound (as it\noccurs in “‘I’ is a pronoun” or\n“‘Iohannes’ is trisyllabic”), and formal, when\nthe term stands for what it properly signifies. Formal supposition is\ntwofold: simple and personal. Like William of Sherwood, Peter of\nSpain, and Burley, and against Ockham and his followers, Wyclif\naffirms that the supposition is simple if the term stands for an\nextra-mental universal only, as it occurs in ‘Man can be\npredicated of every man’, and ‘Man is a species’.\nAccording to Wyclif, in both cases the term ‘man’\nsupposits for the human nature, which is an extra-mental form common\nto a multiplicity of singulars. Simple supposition is divided into\nequal and unequal. A term is in simple equal supposition if it stands\nfor the common nature that it directly signifies, as it occurs in\n‘man is a species’. A term is in simple unequal\nsupposition when it stands for (1) a less common nature than that it\nsignifies, as it occurs in ‘substance is a species’, or\n(2) a concrete accident or the characterizing property (pro\naccidente vel proprio primo), as it occurs in ‘this\nuniversal-man is capable of laughing’ (‘hic homo\ncommunis est risibilis’) — where the presence of the\ndemonstrative ‘this‘ modifies the significate of the\nsubject-term ‘universal-man’, so that in the sentence it\nsupposits for that concrete exemplification (the human nature proper\nto an individual man) which is identical with the subject of inherence\n(a given human being) of the accidental form, or characterizing\nproperty (in the example, the capacity-of-laughing), signified by the\npredicate-term. The supposition is personal when the term which plays\nthe role of subject in a sentence stands for one or more individuals.\nIn the first case, the supposition is personal and singular, as it\noccurs in ‘this man is’ (‘hic homo\nest’); in the second one, it is personal and common. The\npersonal and common supposition is twofold. If the term stands for\nmany singulars considered separately or for some (that is, at least\none) determinate individual named by the common term itself, the\nsupposition is personalis distincta (or determinate, as\nWyclif calls it in the final section of the chapter 12), as it occurs\nin ‘these (men) are’ (‘isti sunt’).\nIf the term stands for many singulars considered together, the\nsupposition is a personal universal supposition (personalis\nuniversalis). In turn, the personal universal supposition is\ndivided into confused and distributive (confusa distributiva)\nand merely confused (confusa tantum). There is suppositio\npersonalis communis universalis confusa distributiva when the\n(subject-)term stands for everything which has the form it signifies,\nas it occurs in ‘every man is’ (‘omnis homo\nest’). There is suppositio personalis communis\nuniversalis confusa tantum when the form (or property) signified\nby the term at issue is affirmed (or not affirmed) equally well of one\nof the bearers of that form as of another, since it applies (or does\nnot apply) to each for exactly the same reasons, as it occurs in\n‘both of them are one of the two’ (‘uterque\nistorum est alter istorum’), where the expression\n‘one of the two’ has merely confused supposition, since\nnone of the two can be both of them. The confused suppositions are so\ncalled since they involve many different individuals, and this is the\ncase for the subject of a universal affirmative proposition (De\nlogica, chap. 12, pp. 39–40). \nWyclif takes a resolutely realist stand, as his formulation and\ndivision of supposition (where simple supposition is described as that\npossessed by a term in relation to a universal outside the intellect\nand personal supposition as that possessed by a term in relation to\none or more individual) make evident. In this way, he stresses the\nontological entailments of Burley’s theory. In his De\nsuppositionibus and De puritate artis logicae Burley had\nadopted a semantic point of view in describing supposition, since he\nhad defined formal supposition as the supposition that a term has when\nit stands for its own significatum or for the (individual)\nitems which fall under it. In the first case, we properly speak of\nsimple supposition, and in the second, we speak of personal\nsupposition. Wyclif makes clear what Burley had stated only\nimplicitly: the significatum of a common term is always a\ncommon nature (that is, a universal form) really existing outside the\nintellect. This fits in with his theory of meaning and his\nontology. \nIn the first chapter of his treatise on logic (De logica,\nchap. 1, pp. 2–7) Wyclif maintains that: (1) a categorematic\nterm is a dictio to which a mental concept, sign of a thing,\ncorresponds in the soul. (2) Categorematic terms are divided into\ncommon (namely, general expressions), like ‘man’ and\n‘dog’, and discrete (namely, singular referring\nexpressions), such as personal and demonstrative pronouns and proper\nnames. (3) Common terms originally and primarily signify common\nnatures — for instance, the term ‘man’ originally\nand primarily signifies the human nature. (4) Categorematic terms can\nbe divided into substantial terms, such as ‘man’, and\naccidental terms, such as ‘white’. A substantial term\nsignifies a common nature proper to a set of individuals (of which the\nterm is the name) without connoting any accidental property; while an\naccidental term signifies (but we would rather say: ‘referes\nto’) a common essence, proper to a set of individuals, and also\n(we would add: connotes) an accidental property, that is, a property\nwhich is not constitutive of the essence referred to. (5)\nCategorematic common terms can be divided also into abstract and\nconcrete. According to Wyclif, a concrete term, like\n‘man’, is a term which signifies a thing that can have\nboth simple and personal supposition at once. On the contrary, an\nabstract term is a term which signifies only a common nature without\nconnoting anything else, like ‘humanity’ and\n‘whiteness’. It is worth noticing that in defining\nconcrete terms Wyclif a) plainly attributes the capacity for\nsuppositing to things; b) does not clarify the metaphysical\ncomposition of such things signified by concrete terms; and c)\ndescribes the twofold supposition of concrete terms as a sort of\nsignification. (6) Finally, categorematic terms can be divided into\nterms of first and second intention. A term of first intention is a\nsign which signifies without connoting the properties of\nbeing-individual or being-universal which characterize categorial\nitems. For example, ‘God’ and ‘man’ are terms\nof first intention. On the contrary, a term of second intention is a\nterm which connotes such properties and refers to a common nature\nwithout naming it. ‘Universal’ and ‘primary\nsubstance’ are terms of second intention. \nAs is evident, the basic ideas of Wyclif’s theory of meaning are\nthat (1) every simple expression in our language is like a label\nnaming just one essence in the world; and (2) distinctions among terms\nas well as their linguistic and semantic properties are derived from\nthe ontological features of signified things. He affirms that\neverything which exists signifies in a complex manner that it is\nsomething real (De logica, chap. 5, p. 14 — see Cesalli\n2005); expressly claims that supposition is also a property of\nsignified things; and explains the semantic difference between general\nterms, such as ‘man’, which can name a set of individuals,\nand singular expressions, such as ‘Socrates’ or ‘a\ncertain man’ (‘aliquis homo’), which name\njust one item, by means of the different modalities of existence of\ntheir different signified things (significata). Singular\nexpressions name and signify individuals, albeit general terms name\nand signify common natures. In Wyclif’s view, a common term\ngives name to a certain set of individuals only by way of the nature\nthat it originally and directly signifies, and is common to a certain\ngroup of individuals as their own quiddity (De logica, chap.\n1, p. 7). As is evident from what he says in the first three chapters\nof his De logica (on terms, universals, and categories\nrespectively), Wyclif identifies secondary substances (that is, the\nuniversals of the category of substance) with the significata\nof general (concrete) terms of that category (such as\n‘man’ or ‘animal’) and individual substances\nwith the significata of singular expressions of that category\n(such as ‘this man’, which refers to a single human\nindividual only). Furthermore, he holds that (1) common terms of the\ncategory of substance, when used predicatively, specified which kind\nof substance a certain individual substance is; (2) individual\nsubstances are unique physical entities, located at a particular place\nin space and time; and (3) universal substances are the specific or\ngeneric natures proper to the individual substances, immanent in them,\nand apt to be common to many individuals at the same time. As a\nresult, like Burley, Wyclif thinks of universals and individuals as\nlinked together by a sort of relation of instantiation. In other\nwords, he conceives of individuals as the tokens of universal natures,\nand universal natures as the types of individuals. This consequence is\ncommon also to many other Realist authors of the 13th and 14th\ncenturies. But, because of his peculiar reading of the relation\nbetween universals and individuals, Wyclif derives from it an original\nconception of the signification and suppostion of concrete accidental\nterms, such as ‘white’, that inspired the new theories and\ndivisions of supposition developed in Oxford between 14th and 15th\ncenturies. According to them, any concrete accidental term which\noccurs as an extreme in a proposition can stand for (1) the substrate\nof inherence of the accidental form that it connotes (suppositio\npersonalis), or (2) the accidental form itself (suppositio\nabstractiva), or (3) the aggregate composed of the individual\nsubstance, which plays the role of the substrate of the form, and the\nsingular accidental form at issue (suppositio concretiva)\n(so, for instance, William Penbygull in his treatise on\nuniversals). \nWyclif ends chapter 12 of his De logica with three\nnotanda (pp. 40–42), by which he completes his\ntreatment of supposition. In the first one, he recalls that\ncategorematic common concrete terms can supposit both\npersonaliter and simpliciter at once\n(mixtim) when the propositions where they occur as subjects\nare universal affirmative or indefinite. For instance, the term\n‘animal’ in (1) ‘every animal was in Noah’s\nark’ (‘omne animal fuit in archa Noe’ as\nwell as the term ‘man’ in (2) ‘man dies’\n(‘homo moritur’) can supposit personaliter for\nevery individual animal and man respectively, and if so, the first\nsentence is false and the second true, and simpliciter for\nevery species of animals and the human nature respectively, and then\nboth sentences are true. In the second notandum, Wyclif\ncontends that proper names, personal and demonstrative pronouns, and\nthose terms of second intention by which we speak of the singular\nitems considered as such (namely, expression like\n‘persona’ and ‘individuum’)\ncannot supposit distributively, since they were devised in order to\nsignify discrete vel singulariter only. Finally, in the third\none, he lays down the following rules about the supposition possessed\nby the subject-term and the predicate-term in the Square of\nOppositions: (1) in every universal affirmative proposition, the\nsubject supposits mobiliter, that is: it has confused and\ndistributive supposition, while the predicate has suppositio\nconfusa tantum or simple. The supposition is merely confused if\nit does not allow for descent to a certain singular nor a universal\n— in other words, a (predicate-)term has the supposition\nconfusa tantum when it is used attributively of its\nextension. The supposition is simple if the predicate-term refers to a\ncommon nature, as it is the case in ‘every man is man’,\nwhere the predicate ‘man’ supposits for the human nature.\n(2) Both the subject and predicate of a universal negative proposition\nhave confused distributive supposition, if they are common terms, as\nit occurs in ‘no man is a stone’. (3) In particular\naffirmative propositions, such as ‘some man is animal’,\nboth the subject and predicate have determinate supposition. (4) In\nparticular negative propositions, the subject-term has determinate\nsupposition and the predicate-term has distributive confused\nsupposition. \nWyclif’s own discussion of the sophism I promise you a coin\nthat I do not promise (Logicae continuatio, tr. 3, chap.\n3, vol. 2, pp. 55–72; but see also the Tractatus de\nuniversalibus, chap. 7, pp. 133–35) makes evident the\nrealist stand showed by his theories of meaning and supposition. Like\nBurley before him, in his Logicae continuatio Wyclif defends\nthe claim that what is explicitly promised in such a promise, ‘I\npromise you one or other of these coins I have in my hands’\n(promitto tibi alterum illorum denariorum in altera manuum\nmearum), is the universal-coin, and not a singular one, even if I\ncan fulfil the promise only by giving any singular coin, since a\nuniversal cannot be given or possessed except by a singular\n(Logicae continuatio, tr. 3, chap. 3, p. 62). Thanks to his\ndistinction between simple and personal supposition, Wyclif is able to\nexplain from a semantic point of view the difference between promising\na coin in general and promising a particular coin: in the first case\nthe term ‘coin’ (denarius) has simple\nsupposition, and therefore the proposition is true if and only if what\nis said is true of the universal-coin; on the contrary, if the term\n‘coin’ has personal supposition (more precisely, personal\nand singular supposition), the proposition is true if and only if what\nis said is true of a particular coin. According to him, by\npromising a singular, a universal is promised secundarie and\nconfuse, and conversely (ibid., p. 64). So, given\ntwo coins in my hands, the coin A and the coin B,\nthe proposition ‘I promise you one or other of these\ncoins’ is true, even though, when asked whether I promised the\ncoin A, my answer is ‘No’, and so too when asked\nwhether I promised the coin B. In fact, according to Wyclif,\nwhat I promised is the universal-coin, since the phrase ‘one or\nother of these coins’ has simple supposition and therefore\nstands for a universal, however restricted in its instantiations to\none or other of the two coins in my hands (ibid., p. 67). \nThis does not mean that the universal-coin is a sort of third coin\nover and above the two coins in my hands. Wyclif had already rejected\nthis mistaken conclusion in the previous chapter of the Logicae\ncontinuatio. He argues that to add the universal-man as a third\nman to Socrates and Plato, given that there are only these two\nindividual men in the world, exhibits a fallacy of equivocation. When\na number is added to a term of first intention (like\n‘man’), the presence of this numerical term modifies the\nkind of supposition from simple to personal; but one can refer to a\nuniversal only with a term with simple supposition. As a consequence\nthe universal cannot be counted with its individuals – and in\nfact any universal is really identical to each one of its individuals,\nand so it cannot differ in number from each of them (ibid.,\nchap. 2, p. 48). \nThe point of departure for Wyclif’s metaphysics is the notion of\nbeing, since it occupies the central place in his ontology. After Duns\nScotus, the real issue for metaphysics was the relationship between\nbeing and, on the other side, God and creatures, as Scotus’\ntheory of the univocity of the concept of being was an absolute\nnovelty, full of important consequences for the development of later\nmedieval philosophy. Wyclif takes many aspects from Scotus’\nexplanation, but strongly stresses the ontological implications of the\ndoctrine. Wyclif, like Scotus, claims that the notion of being is the\nmost general one, a notion entailed by all others, but he also states\nthat an extra-mental reality corresponds to the concept of\nbeing-in-general (ens in communi). This extra-mental reality\nis predicated of everything (God and creatures, substances and\naccidents, universal and individual essences) according to different\ndegrees, since God is in the proper sense of the term and any\nother entity is (something real) only insofar as it shares the being\nof God (De ente in communi, chap. 1, pp. 1–2; chap. 2,\np. 29; De ente praedicamentali, chap. 1, p. 13; chap. 4, p.\n30; Tractatus de universalibus, chap. 4, p. 89; chap. 7, p.\n130; chap. 12, p. 279; De materia et forma, chap. 6, p.\n213). \nIf being is a reality, it is then clear that it is impossible to\naffirm its univocity. The Doctor Subtilis thought of being as\nsimply a concept, and therefore could describe it as univocal in a\nbroad sense (one name — one concept — many natures).\nWyclif, on the contrary, is convinced that the being-in-general is an\nextra-mental reality, so he works out his theory at a different level\nthan does Scotus: no more at the intensional level (the meaning\nconnected with the univocal sign, or univocum univocans), but\nat the extensional one (the thing signified by the mental sign,\nconsidered as shared by different entities according to different\ndegrees). For that reason, he cannot use Aristotelian univocation,\nwhich hides these differences in sharing. Thus he denies the univocity\nof being and prefers to use one of the traditional notions of analogy\n(De ente praedicamentali, chap. 3, pp. 25, 27), since the\nbeing of God is the measure of the being of other things, which are\ndrawn up on a scale with the separated spiritual substances at the top\nand prime matter at the bottom. Therefore he qualifies being as an\nambiguous genus (ibidem, p. 29), borrowing an expression\nalready used by Grosseteste in his commentary on Aristotle’s\nPosterior Analytics. The analogy of being does not entail a\nmultiplicity of correlated meanings, however, as in Thomas Aquinas.\nSince Wyclif hypostatizes the notion of being and considers\nequivocity, analogy, and univocity as real relations between things,\nnot as semantic relations between terms and things, his analogy is\npartially equivalent to the standard Aristotelian univocity, since\nwhat differentiates analogy from univocity is the way a certain nature\n(or property) is shared by a set of things: analogous things\n(analoga) share it according to different degrees\n(secundum magis et minus, or secundum prius et\nposterius), while univocal things (univoca) share it all\nin the same manner and at the same degree. This is the true sense of\nhis distinction between ambiguous genera, like being and accident\n(accidens), and logical genera, like substance (De ente\npraedicamentali, chap. 4, pp. 30, 32). Hence, according to this\naccount, being in general is the basic component of the metaphysical\nstructure of each reality, which possesses it in accordance with its\nown nature, value, and position in the hierarchy of created\nbeings. \nUnfortunately, this theory is weak in an important point, since Wyclif\ndoes not clarify the relation between being-in-general and God. On the\none hand, being is a creature, the first of all the creatures; on the\nother hand, God should share it, as being-in-general is the most\ncommon reality, predicated of all, and according to him\nto-be-predicated-of something means to-be-shared-by it. As a\nconsequence, a creature would be in some respect superordinated to God\n— a theological puzzle that Wyclif failed to acknowledge. \nAccording to Wyclif, the constitutive property of each kind of being\nis the capacity to be the object of a complex act of signifying\n(De ente in communi, chap. 3, p. 36; De ente primo in\ncommuni, chap. 1, p. 70). This choice implies a revolution in the\nstandard medieval theory of transcendentals, since Wyclif actually\nreplaces being (ens) with true (verum). According to\nthe common belief, among the transcendentals (being, thing, one,\nsomething, true, good) being was the primitive notion, from which all\nthe others stemmed by adding a specific connotation in relation to\nsomething else, or by adding some new determination. So true\n(verum) was nothing but being (ens) itself\nconsidered in relation to an intellect, no matter whether divine or\nhuman. In Wyclif’s view, on the contrary, being is no longer the\nmain transcendental and its notion is not the first and simplest;\nrather there is something more basic to which being can be reduced:\ntruth (veritas or verum). According to the English\nphilosopher, only what can be signified by a complex expression is a\nbeing, and whatever is the proper object of an act of signifying is a\ntruth. Truth is therefore the true name of being itself (Tractatus\nde universalibus, chap. 7, p. 139). Thus everything that is is a\ntruth, and every truth is something not simple but complex. Absolute\nsimplicity is unknown within Wyclif’s metaphysical world. From\nthe semantic point of view, this means the collapsing of the\nfundamental distinction in the common Aristotelian theory of meaning,\nthe one between simple signs (like nouns) and compound signs (like\npropositions). From the ontological point of view, this entails the\nuniqueness in type of what is signified by every class of\ncategorematic expressions (Logica, chap. 5, p. 14). Within\nWyclif’s world, it is the same kind of object that both concrete\nterms and propositions refer to, as individual substances have to be\nregarded as (atomic) states of affairs. According to him, from the\nmetaphysical point of view a singular man is nothing but a real\nproposition (propositio realis), where actual existence in\ntime as an individual plays the role of the subject, the common nature\n(i.e., human nature) plays the role of the predicate, and the singular\nessence (i.e., that by means of which this individual is a man) plays\nthe role of the copula (ibid., pp. 14–15). \nDespite appearances, Wyclif’s opinion on this subject is not\njust a new formulation of the theory of the complexe\nsignificabile. According to the supporters of the complexe\nsignificabile theory, the same things that are signified by\nsimple concrete terms are signified by complex expressions (or\npropositions). In Wyclif’s thought, on the contrary, there are\nno simple things in the world that correspond to simple concrete\nterms; rather, simple concrete terms designate real propositions, that\nis, atomic states of affairs. Wyclif’s real proposition is that\neverything that is, as everything save God is composed at least of\npotency and act (De ente praedicamentali, chap. 5, pp.\n38–39), can therefore be conceived of and signified both in a\ncomplex (complexe) and in a non-complex manner\n(incomplexe) (Tractatus de universalibus, chap. 2,\npp. 55–56; chap. 3, pp. 70, 74, and 84; chap. 6, pp.\n118–19). When we conceive of a thing in a complex manner, we\nconsider that thing according to its metaphysical structure, and so\naccording to its many levels of being and kinds of essence. As a\nconsequence, Wyclif’s metaphysical world, like his physical\nworld, consists of atomic objects, that is, single essences belonging\nto the ten different types or categories. But these metaphysical atoms\nare not simple but rather composite, because they are reducible to\nsomething else, belonging to a different rank of reality and unable to\nexist by themselves: being and essence, potency and act, matter and\nform, abstract genera, species and differences. For that reason,\neverything one can speak about or think of is both a thing and an\natomic state of affairs, while every true sentence expresses a\nmolecular state of affairs, that is, the union (if the sentence is\naffirmative) or the separation (if the sentence is negative) of two\n(or more) atomic objects (on Wyclif’s theory of proposition see\nCesalli 2005). \nAmong the many kinds of beings Wyclif lists, the most important set is\nthat consisting of categorial beings. They are characterized by the\ndouble fact of having a nature and of being the constitutive elements\nof finite corporeal beings or atomic states of affairs. These\ncategorial items, conceived of as instances of a certain kind of\nbeing, are called by Wyclif ‘essences’\n(essentiae). An essence therefore is a being that has a well\ndefined nature, even if the name ‘essence’ does not make\nthis nature known (De ente primo in communi, chap. 3, pp.\n88–89; De ente praedicamentali, chap. 5, p. 43;\nTractatus de universalibus, chap. 7, pp. 128–29; De\nmateria et forma, chap. 4, pp. 185–86). So the term\n‘essence’ (essentia) is less general than\n‘being’ (ens), but more general than\n‘quiddity’ (quidditas), since (i) every essence\nis a being, and not every being is an essence, and (ii) every quiddity\nis an essence, and not every essence is a quiddity, as individual\nthings are essences but are not quiddities (see Kenny 1985, pp. 21\nff.; and Conti 1993, pp. 171–81). \nAccording to Wyclif, being is the stuff that the ten categories\nmodulate according to their own nature, so that everything is\nimmediately something that is (De ente praedicamentali, chap.\n4, p. 30; Tractatus de universalibus, chap. 7, p. 130);\ntherefore, he maintains no real distinction between essence and being.\nThe essences of creatures do not precede their beings, not even\ncausally, since every thing is identical with its essence. The being\nof a thing is brought into existence by God at the same instant as its\nessence, since essence without being and being without essence would\nbe two self-contradictory states of affairs. In fact, essence without\nbeing would imply that an individual could be something of a given\ntype without being real in any way, and being without essence would\nimply that there could be the existence of a thing without the thing\nitself (Tractatus de universalibus, chap. 6, pp.\n122–23). As a consequence, the pars destruens of his\ntheory of being and essence is a strong refutation of the twin\nopinions of St. Thomas and Giles of Rome. Although Wyclif does not\nname either the Dominican master or the Augustinian one, it is\nnevertheless clear from the context that their conceptions are the\nobject of his criticisms (ibid., pp. 120–22). \nOn the other hand, it is evident that while from the extensional point\nof view the being and essence of creatures are equipollent, since\nevery being is an essence and vice versa, from the\nintensional point of view there is a difference, because the being of\na thing logically presupposes its essence and not vice\nversa (De materia et forma, chap. 4, pp. 184–85).\nMoreover, in Wyclif’s opinion, every creature has two different\nkinds of essence and four levels of being. Indeed, he clearly\ndistinguishes between singular essence and universal essence\n(essentia quidditativa speciei vel generis) — that is,\nthe traditional forma partis and forma totius. The\nsingular essence is the form that in union with the matter brings\nabout the substantial composite. The universal essence is the type\nthat the former instantiates; it is present in the singular substance\nas a constitutive part of its nature, and it discloses the inner\nmetaphysical structure of the substantial composite (Tractatus de\nuniversalibus, chap. 6, pp. 116–18). Furthermore, he speaks\nof four-fold level of reality (esse): \nThus the identity between essence and being cannot be complete.\nConsequently Wyclif speaks of a formal difference (distinctio\nor differentia formalis) — which he also calls a\n‘difference of reason’ (distinctio rationis)\n— between essence and being. More precisely, he holds that: \nIn this way, Wyclif establishes a close connection between singular\nessence and essential being, on the one hand, and a real identity\nbetween universal and individual (that is, between universal essence\nand singular essence), on the other hand. Essential being is the level\nof being that matches singular essence, while actual existence is in a\ncertain way accidental to the singular essence, as the latter is\nnothing else but the universal essence considered as informing\nmatter. \nSince Wyclif thought of substance as the ultimate substrate of\nexistence and subject of predication in relation to anything else, the\nonly way to demonstrate the reality of the items belonging to other\ncategories was to conceive of them as forms and attributes of\nsubstance. Accordingly, he insists that quantity, quality, and\nrelations, considered as accidents, are forms inherent in the\ncomposite substances (cf. De ente praedicamentali, ch. 6, p.\n48). In this way, just like Walter Burley, Wyclif wanted to safeguard\nthe reality of accidents as well as their (real) distinction from\nsubstance and from each other, while at the same time affirming their\ndependence on substance in existence.  \nAmong the nine genera of accidents, quantity is the most important\none, as it is the basis of all further accidents, because every other\naccident presupposes it. Indeed, quantity orders substance for\nreceiving quality and the other accidental forms. In his commentary on\nthe Categories (ch. 10, § 4) and in the first part of\nhis Summa Logicae (pars I, ch. 44) Ockham had\nclaimed that it was superfluous to posit quantitative forms really\ndistinct from substance and quality, since quantity presupposes what\nit is intended to explain, that is, the extension of material\nsubstances and their having parts outside parts. As an accident,\nquantity presupposes substance as its substrate of inherence. Like\nBurley, Wyclif also denies that material substance can be actually\nextended without the presence of quantitative forms in it, thereby\naffirming their necessity (cf. De ente praedicamentali, ch.\n6, p. 50.), and consequently he tries to confute Ockham’s\nargumentation (ibidem, pp. 50–58). He admits that the\nexistence of any quantity always implies that of substance, but he\nalso believes that the actual existence of parts in a substance\nnecessarily implies the presence of a quantitative form in it,\ndistinct (1) from the substance (say Socrates) in which it inheres,\nand (2) from the truth, grounded on the substance at issue, that this\nsame substance is a quantified thing (ibidem, pp.\n51–53). He does not give us any sound metaphysical reason for\nthis preference. Nevertheless, it is easily understandable, when\nconsidered from the point of view of his semantic presuppositions,\naccording to which, the reality itself is the interpretative pattern\nof our language. \nAs a consequence, the structure of language is a mere mirroring of\nthat of reality. In Wyclif’s opinion, therefore, some entities\nmust correspond in the world to the abstract terms of the category of\nquantity (like ‘magnitudo’) – entities\nreally distinct from the things signified by the substantial terms. In\nany case, the most important evidence he offers for proving his thesis\nis a sort of abductive reasoning, whose implicit premise is the\nfollowing inferential rule: if we can recognize a thing as the same\nthing before and after its undertaking a process of change, then what\nis changed is not the thing at issue, but a distinct entity really\npresent in that thing as one of its real aspects. The second premise\nis the observation that men are of different size during their lives.\nAnd the conclusion is that those changes are due to an accidental form\ndistinct from the substances in which it inheres (ibidem, p.\n50). \nImmediately after quantity, quality comes. Following Aristotle\n(Categories, ch. 8, 8a 25), Wyclif defines quality as that in\nvirtue of which substances are said to be qualified. The chief feature\nof Wyclif ’s treatment of quality is his twofold consideration\nof quality as an abstract form and as a concrete accident. In De\nente praedicamentali he clearly states that quality is an\nabsolute entity, with a well determined nature, and really distinct\nfrom substance (cf. ch. 7, p. 61). Furthermore, even if incidentally,\nagainst Burley, he notes that qualitative forms can admit a more or a\nless, since the propria passio of the category of quality is to be\nmore or less intense (see ibidem, ch. 3, p. 28).  \nBy contrast, in the De actibus animae (pars II, ch.\n4), he seems to conceive of it as a mode of substance, without an\nactually distinct reality. Truly, there is no effective difference\nbetween the theses on quality maintained in those two works, but only\na difference of point of view. As what he says about the\nreal-and-essential distinction and the first sub-type of formal\ndistinction makes evident, quality considered in an absolute way,\naccording to its main level of being, is an abstract form, really\ndistinct from substance; yet, if considered from the point of view of\nits existence as a concrete accident, it is not really distinct from\nthe substance in which it is present, but only formally. In the latter\ncase,it is a mere mode of the substance, like any other concrete\naccident. In fact, in the De ente praedicamentali Wyclif\nspeaks of quality,using the abstract term, while in the De actibus\nanimae he constantly utilises concrete expressions, such as\n‘quale’ and ‘substantia\nqualis.’ \nAristotle’s treatment of relations in the Categories\n(ch. 7) and in the Metaphysics (V, ch.15) is opaque and\nincomplete. Because of this fact, in the Late Antiquity and in the\nMiddle Ages many authors tried to reformulate the doctrine of\nrelatives. Wyclif ’s attempt is one of the most interesting\namong those of the whole Middle Ages, as he very likely was the first\nmedieval author able to work out a concept of relation conceived of as\nan accidental form which is in both the relatives at once, even though\nin different ways. Consequently his relation can be considered the\nontological equivalent to our modern functions with two variables, or\ntwo-place predicates, whereas all the other authors of the Middle Ages\nhad thought of the relations in terms of monadic functions. As a\nmatter of fact, according to Wyclif, relation is different from\nquality and quantity, since it presupposes them just as what follows\nby nature presupposes what precedes. Moreover, quantity and quality\nare, in a certain way, absolute entities, but relation qua such is a\nsort of link between two things (see De ente praedicamentali,\nch. 7, p. 61). \nWyclif thinks that the items directly falling into any categorial\nfield are simple accidental forms, therefore he distinguishes between\nrelations (relationes) and relatives (relativa or\nad aliquid) – these latter being the aggregates formed\nby a substance, a relation, and the foundation (fundamentum),\nof the relation. Accordingly, the relationship between relation and\nrelatives is, for him, similar to the ones between quantity and what\nis quantified, and quality and what is qualified. The relation is the\nvery cause of the nature of the aggregates (that is, the relatives) of\nwhich it is a constituent; yet, unlike the other accidental forms,\nrelations do not directly inhere in their substrates, but are present\nin them only by means of other accidental forms, that Wyclif,\nfollowing a well established tradition, calls ‘foundations of\nthe relation’. In his view, quantity and quality only can be the\nfoundation of a categorial relation (ibidem, pp.\n61–62).Thus, according to Wyclif’s description, in the act\nof relating one substance to another four different constitutive\nelements can be singled out: (1) the relation itself (for instance,\nthe form of similarity); (2) the foundation of the relation, that is,\nthe absolute entity in virtue of which the relation at issue is\npresent in the two substances correlated to each other (in this case,\nthe form of whiteness which makes the two substances at issue similar\nto each other); (3) the subject of the relation (or its first\nextreme), that is, the aggregate compound of (a) the\nsubstance which denominatively receives the names of the relation (in\nour example, the substance which is similar to another, say Socrates)\nand (b) of the foundation of the relation ; (4) the second\nextreme (of the relation), that is, another aggregate compund of a\nsubstance and its own foundation, that the subject of the relation is\nconnected with, (in our example, a second substance which is, in its\nturn, similar to the first one, say Plato). \nThe fundamentum of the relation is the main component, since\nit (1) joins the relation to the underlying substances, (2) lets the\nrelation link the subject to the object, and (3) transmits to the\nrelation some of its properties. Even though relation depends for its\nexistence on the foundation, its being is really distinct from it, as\nwhen the foundation fails the relation also fails, but not vice versa\n(ibidem, pp. 62–64 and 67). \nSome rather important conclusions about the nature and the ontological\nstatus of relations and relatives follow from these premisses: \nLike Duns Scotus, Wyclif divides relations into transcendental and\ncategorial relations (ibidem p. 61–62), and, moreover,\nlike many of his predecessors and contemporaries, among the latter he\ncontrasts real relatives (relativa secundum esse) with\nrelatives of reason (relativa rationis), or linguistic\nrelatives (relativa secundum dici – see\nibidem, pp. 62–64). Wyclif defines real relatives as\nthose aggregates (1) made up of a substance and (2) an absolute\naccidental form (quantity or quality), (3) whose reality consists in\nbeing correlated to something else. If one of these three conditions\nis not fulfilled, we will speak of relatives of reason (cf.\nibidem, p. 63). \nIn this way, Wyclif eliminates from the description of the relatives\nof reason any reference to our mind, and utilizes objective criteria\nonly, based on the framework of reality itself. In fact he maintains\nthat there are three kinds of relations of reason, each one\ncharacterized by the occurrence of at least one of these negative\nconditions: (1) one of the two extremes of the relation is not a\nsubstance with its foundation; (2) both the extremes of the relation\nare not substances; (3) there is no foundation for the relation, or it\nis not an absolute accident – that is, a quantity, or a quality\n(ibidem). The strategy which supports this choice is evident:\nWyclif attempts to substitute references to mental activity by\nreferences to external reality. In other words, he seeks to reduce\nepistemology to ontology, in accordance with his realist program. \nWyclif’s world is ultimately grounded on divine essence. Thus\nthere is a close connection between any kind of truth and the\ndivine ideas (cf. Tractatus de universalibus, chap. 15, pp.\n371–74; De materia et forma, chap. 2, pp.\n170–76). Divine ideas play a threefold role in relation to God\nand creatures: they are (i) the specific essences of individual things\nthemselves, considered according to their intelligible being in the\nmind of God; (ii) God’s principles of cognition of creatures;\nand (iii) the eternal models of creatures. If we also take into\naccount that in his opinion (iv) divine ideas are really the same as\nthe divine essence and formally distinct from it, and (v) this\ndistinction originates from their being efficient (con)causes in\nrelation to the different kinds of creatures, we can easily realize\nwhy Wyclif’s position on this matter leads to heretical\nconsequences from the point of view of the Catholic theology: (i)\nmetaphysical and theological necessitarianism; (ii) restriction of\ndivine omnipotence; (iii) negation of the process of\ntransubstantiation in the Eucharist. In fact, Wyclif defines ideas as\nthe divine nature in action, since they are the means by which God\ncreates all that is outside Himself. In this way, any distinction\nbetween the ideas as pure rationes and the ideas as\nexemplaria, stated by St. Thomas in his Summa\ntheologiae (I, q. 15), is abolished. Furthermore, ideas are the\nconstitutive principles of divine nature, essentially identical with\nit. Thus divine ideas become as necessary as the divine nature itself.\nOn the other side, ideas are the first of the four levels of being\nproper to creatures. Indeed, since God could not help but create this\nUniverse (as we shall see in Section 4.2), everything which is is\nnecessary and so is a necessary object of God’s volition. Thus,\nthe three spheres of possible, existent, and necessary totally\ncoincide. As a matter of fact, Wyclif, having defined necessary truths\nas those truths which cannot not be the case, (i) distinguishes\nbetween absolutely necessary truths and conditionally (or relatively\n– secundum quid) necessary truths, and (ii) tries to\nshow how relative necessity is consistent with supreme contingence\n(Logicae continuatio, tr. 1, chap. 11, vol. 1, pp.\n156–65). He thought that such distinctions enabled him to\nmaintain simultaneously the necessity of all that happens and human\nfreedom (cf. Tractatus de universalibus, ch. 14, pp.\n333–47); and many times he affirms that it would be heretical to\nsay that all things happen by absolute necessity; but his\nattempt failed in achieving its goal. \nAccording to him, absolutely necessary truths are such truths as (i)\nthose of theology (like the real proposition that God exists), that\nare per se necessary and do not depend on something else;\n(ii) those of geometry, that neither can, nor ever could, nor ever\nwill be able to be otherwise, even though they depend on something\nelse (est ab alio sed non potuit non esse); and (iii) the\npast and present truths (like the real proposition that I have existed\n– me fuisse), that cannot be, but might have been\notherwise (per accidens necessarium, quia est necessarium quod\npotuit non esse). On the contrary, relative necessity applies to\nthose events that must follow certain conditions in order to be or\nhappen – so that any contingent truth is relatively necessary if\nconsidered in relation to its conditions (Logicae\ncontinuatio, tr. 1, chap. 11, p. 157). In its turn, relative\nnecessity is divided into antecedent, consequent, and concomitant. (i)\nA certain truth is an antecedent relative necessity when its existence\ncauses the existence of another contingent truth (antecedens ut\ncausa contingentis, inferens posterius naturaliter). An instance\nof such a necessity is the necessity of volition, as where my\nunconstrained will or the unconstrained will of God is the cause which\nnecessitates something else (ibid., p, 158). (ii) A certain\ntruth is a consequent relative necessity when its existence is caused\nby an antecedent (relative) necessity. And finally, (iii) a certain\ntruth is a concomitant relative necessity when it merely accompanies\nanother true event (ibid., p. 157). These features proper to\nthe relative necessity are not opposites, and the same truth may be\nnecessary in all the three ways (ibid., pp. 157–58).\nWyclif insists that all three kinds of relative necessity are\ncontingent truths in themselves (ibid., p. 158), yet he was\nunable to show how this is possible. He thought he had an explanation,\nbut he was mistaken. In his Tractatus de universalibus (where\nhe uses all these distinctions in order to try to solve the problem of\nthe relationship between divine power and human freedom), he\nexplicitly maintains that in relation to the foreknowledge of God\nevery effect is necessary to come about (Tractatus de\nuniversalibus, chap. 14, p. 333), and the Aristotelian principle\nthat everything which is, when it is, necessarily is (the well known\nformulation of the diachronic contingence), applies also to what will\nbe and has been (ibid., p. 334). Taking into account that God\nhimself cannot begin or cease actually to know or will something, and\nthus He cannot change from knowing that p to knowing that\nnot-p (where p is a given truth), nor from volition\nto non-volition or vice versa (ibid., p.\n335; cf. also De volucione Dei, chap. 3, p. 149), the logical\nresult is that in Wyclif’s world nothing may happen purely\ncontingently. It is true that Wyclif insists that even if God can\nnever change from volition to non-volition, the fact that God wills\np is in itself contingent, if p is not a theological\ntruth (De volucione Dei, chap. 7, p. 192), but, like\nBradwardine, he maintains that God’s antecedent will is\nnaturally prior to what He foresees. Given that God is immutable, and\nhence that the divine power is not affected by the passage of time,\nand divine ideas, within Wyclif’s system, are as necessary as\nthe divine essence itself, the logical consequence is that, despite\nWyclif’s claims of the contrary, the whole history of the world\nis determined from eternity. As a matter of fact, Wyclif’s\nconditional (or relative) necessity is as necessary as his absolute\nnecessity: given God, the world’s entire history follows. \nThis doctrine of divine ideas and the connected theory of being had a\nsignificant result also for the notion of divine omnipotence. In the\nMiddle Ages, one of the most important features of divine omnipotence\nwas the capacity of annihilating, which was viewed as the necessary\ncounterpart of the divine capacity of creating. Wyclif denies the\nthesis of an opposition between creation and annihilation, and\nexplicitly denies that God can annihilate creatures. He argues that\nnothing is contrary to creation, since the act of creating is peculiar\nto God, and nothing is opposite or contrary to God. In fact,\nabsolute non-being (the only “thing” that could\nbe considered opposite to God) is something self-contradictory, and\ntherefore logically impossible. Accordingly, there cannot be any\naction opposite to creation. The only possible kind of non-being\nadmitted by Wyclif is corruption (corruptio), that is, the\nnatural destruction of the actual existence in time of an object in\nthe world (Tractatus de universalibus, chap. 13, pp.\n302–3). \nOn the other hand, according to Wyclif, annihilation, if possible,\nwould be equivalent to the total destruction of all of a\ncreature’s levels of being (ibid., p. 307), and thus\nwould imply the following absurdities: \nThe image of God Wyclif draws here is not the Christian image of the\nLord of the universe, who freely creates by an act of His will and has\nabsolute power and control over everything, but a variation of the\nNeoplatonic notion of the One. Wyclif’s God is simply the\nsupreme principle of the universe from which everything necessarily\nflows. Within Wyclif’s system, creation is a form of emanation,\nas each creature is necessarily connected with the divine essence\nitself by means of its esse ideale. God has been deprived of\nthe power of revocation (ibid., pp. 304–5), and the\nonly action He can, or rather has to, perform is creation. Because of\nthe necessary links between (i) the divine essence and the eternal\nmental being that every creature has in God and (ii) this first level\nof being of creatures and the remaining three, for God to think of\ncreatures is already to create them. But God cannot help thinking of\ncreatures, since to think of Himself is to think of His constitutive\nprinciples, that is, of the ideas of creatures. Therefore, God cannot\nhelp creating. Indeed, He could not help creating just this\nuniverse. \nWyclif’s rejection of the possibility of annihilation and the\nsubsequent new notion of divine onnipotence shed light on his theory\nof universals, as they help us to appreciate the difference between\nhis thesis of the identity between universals and individuals and the\nanalogous thesis of moderate Realists. For these latter theses, this\nidentity meant that the individuals are in potentia\nuniversal; for Wyclif it means that the individuals are\nthe universals qua existing in actu —\nthat is, the individuals are the outcome of a process of production\nthat is inscribed into the nature of general essences themselves, and\nthrough which general essences change from an incomplete type of\nsubsistence as forms to a full existence as individuals. This position\nis consistent with (i) his theory of substance, where the main and\nbasic composition of every substance, both individual and universal,\nis not the hylemorphic one, but the composition of potency and act\n(De ente praedicamentali, chap. 5, pp. 38–39), and (ii)\na Neoplatonic reading of Aristotelian metaphysics, where universal\nsubstances, and not individual ones as the Stagirite had taught, are\nthe main and fundamental kind of being (on Wyclif’s doctrine of\nthe divine omnipotence see A. D. Conti, “Annihilatio e\ndivina onnipotenza nel Tractatus de universalibus di\nJohn Wyclif,” in MT. Fumagalli Beonio Brocchieri & S.\nSimoneta 2003, pp.71–85. \nWyclif’s heretical theses concerning the Eucharist are the\nlogical consequence of the application of this philosophical apparatus\nto the problem of the real presence of the body of Christ in the\nconsecrated host. According to Catholic doctrine, after consecration\nthe body of Christ is really present in the host instead of the\nsubstance of the host itself, while the accidents of the host are the\nsame as before. St. Thomas’s explanation of this process, called\n‘transubstantiation’, was that the substance of the bread\n(and wine) was changed into the body (and blood) of Christ, whereas\nits quantity, through which the substance of the bread received\nphysical extension and the other accidental forms, was now the entity\nthat kept the other accidental forms physically in being. Duns Scotus\nand Ockham, on the contrary, had claimed that after consecration the\nsubstance of the bread (and wine) was annihilated by God, while the\naccidents of the bread (and wine) remained the same as before because\nof an intervention of divine omnipotence. \nWyclif rejects both solutions as well as the Catholic formulation of\nthe dogma, since he could not accept the ideas of the destruction of a\nsubstance by God and of the existence of the accidents of a given\nsingular substance without and apart from that singular substance\nitself — two evident absurdities within the metaphyisical\nframework of his system of thought. As a consequence, Wyclif affirms\nthe simultaneous presence in the Eucharist of the body of Crhist and\nof the substance of the bread (and wine), which continues to exist\neven after the consecration. According to him, transubstantiation is\ntherefore a twofold process, natural and supernatural. There is\nnatural transubstantiation when a substitution of one substantial form\nfor another takes place, but the subject-matter remains the same. This\nis the case with water that becomes wine. There is supernatural\ntransubstantiation when a miraculous transformation of the substantial\nentity at issue takes place. This was the case, for instance, with the\nincarnation of the second person of the Trinity, who is God and became\nman (De apostasia, p. 170). The Eucharist implies this second\nkind of transubstantiation, since the Eucharist, like Christ, has a\ndual nature: earthly and divine. According to its earthly nature the\nEucharist is bread (and wine), but according to its divine nature it\nis the body of Christ, which is present in the host spiritually or in\na habitudinal fashion, since it is in virtue and by means of faith\nonly that it could be received (De apostasia, pp. 180 and\n210; De eucharistia, pp. 17, 19, 51–52, and 230; for a\ndescription of the habitudinal presence, see the definition of the\nhabitudinal predication above, Section 2.3 – on the links\nbetween his realism and his eucharistic doctrine see P. J. J. M.\nBakker, “Réalisme et rémanence. La doctrine\neucharistique de Jean Wyclif,” in MT. Fumagalli Beonio\nBrocchieri & S. Simoneta 2003, pp. 87–112; see also Kenny\n1985, pp. 68–90). \nWyclif conceives of Sacred Scripture as a direct emanation from God\nhimself, and therefore as a timeless, unchanging, and archetypal truth\nindependent of the present world and of the concrete material text by\nmeans of which it is manifested. As a consequence, in his De\nveritate Sacrae Scripturae (On the Truth of Sacred\nScripture — between late 1377 and the end of 1378) he tries\nto show that, despite appearences, the Bible is free from error and\ncontradictions. The exegetic principle he adopts is the following:\nsince the authority of Scripture is greater than our capacity of\nunderstanding, if some errors and/or inconsistencies are found in the\nBible, there is something wrong with our interpretation. The Bible\ncontains the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so that nothing\ncan be added to it or subtracted from it. Every part of it has to be\ntaken absolutely and without qualification (De veritate Sacrae\nScripturae, vol. 1, pp. 1–2, 395, 399; vol. 2, pp. 99,\n181–84). \nIn attributing inerrancy to the Bible, Wyclif was following the\ntraditional attitude towards it, but the way he viewed the book\ndetached him from Catholic tradition, as he thought that his own\nmetaphysical system was the necessary interpretative key for the\ncorrect understanding of Biblical truth. In fact, in the\nTrialogus (Trialogue — between late 1382 and\nearly 1383), where Wyclif gives us the conditions for achieving the\ntrue meaning of the Bible, they are the following: \nOnly on the basis of this logical and metaphysical machinery is it\npossible to grasp the five different levels of reality of the Bible,\nwhich are at the same time: \nThis same approach, when applied to the Church, led Wyclif to fight\nagainst it in its contemporary state. (On Wyclif’s ecclesiology\nsee Leff 1967, pp. 516–46.) The starting point of Wyclif’s\nreflection on the Church is the distinction between the heavenly and\nthe earthly cities that St. Augustine draws in his De civitate\nDei. In St. Augustine such a division is metaphorical, but Wyclif\nmade it literal. So he claims that the Holy Catholic Church is the\nmystical and indivisible community of the saved, eternally bound\ntogether by the grace of predestination, while the foreknown, i.e. the\ndamned, are eternally excluded from it (De civili dominio,\nvol. 1, p. 11). This community of the elect is really distinct from\nthe various particular earthly churches (ibid., p. 381). It\nis timeless and outside space, and therefore is not a physical entity;\nits being, like the actual being of any other universal, is wherever\nany of its members is (De ecclesia, p. 99). All its members\nalways remain in grace, even if temporally in mortal sin\n(ibid., p. 409), as conversely the damned remain in mortal\nsin, even if temporally in grace (ibid., p. 139). The true\nChurch is presently divided into three parts: the triumphant Church in\nheaven; the sleeping Church in purgatory; and the militant Church on\nearth (ibid., p. 8). But the militant Church on earth cannot\nbe identified with the visible church and its hierarchy. Even more,\nsince we cannot know who are the elect, there is no reason for\nconsenting to recognize and obey the authority of the visible church\n(see De civili dominio, vol. 1, p. 409; De ecclesia,\npp. 71–2). Authority and dominion rely on God’s law\nmanifested by Sacred Scripture. As a consequence, obedience to any\nmember of the hierarchy is to be subordinated to his fidelity to the\nprecepts of the Bible (De civili dominio, vol. 2, p. 243;\nDe potestate papae [On the Power of the Pope —\nca. 1379], p. 149; De ecclesia, p. 465). Faithfulness to the\ntrue Church can entail the necessity of rebelling against the visible\nchurch and its members, when their requests are in conflict with the\nteaching of Christ (De civili dominio, vol. 1, pp. 384,\n392). \nIn conclusion, since the visible church cannot help the believers gain\nsalvation, which is fixed from eternity, and its authority depends on\nits fidelity to divine revelation, it cannot perform any of the\nfunctions traditionally attributed to it, and it therefore has no\nreason for its own existence. To be ordained a priest offers no\ncertainty of divine approval and authority (De ecclesia, p.\n577). Orthodoxy can only result from the application of right reason\nto the faith of the Bible (De veritate Sacrae Scripturae,\nvol. 1, p. 249). The Pope, bishops, abbots, and priests are expected\nto prove that they really belong to the Holy Catholic Church through\ntheir exemplary behavior; they should be poor and free from worldly\nconcerns, and they should spend their time preaching and praying\n(De ecclesia, pp. 41, 89, 129). In particular, the Pope\nshould not interfere in worldly matters, but should be an example of\nholiness. Believers are always allowed to doubt the clergy’s\nlegitimacy, which can be evaluated only on the basis of its\nconsistency with the Evangelic rules (ibid., pp. 43, 456).\nUnworthy priests forfeit their right to exercise authority and to hold\nproperty, and lay lords might deprive them of their benefices (De\ncivili dominio, vol. 1, p. 353; vol. 3, pp. 326, 413; De\necclesia, p. 257). \nAs Leff remarked (Leff 1967, p. 546), the importance of Wyclif’s\nteaching on dominion and grace has been exaggerated. His doctrine\ndepends on Richard Fitzralph’s theory, according to which the\noriginal lordship is independent of natural and civil circumstances\n(on Fitzralph’s conception see Robson 1961, pp. 70–96),\nand is only a particular application of Wyclif’s general view on\nelection and damnation. In fact, the three main theses of the first\nbook of his De civili dominio are the following: \nWyclif defines dominion as the right to exercise authority and,\nindirectly, to hold property. According to him, there are three kinds\nof possession: natural, civil, and evangelical. Natural possession is\nthe simple possession of goods without any legal title. Civil\npossession is the possession of goods on the basis of some civil law.\nEvangelical possession requires, beyond civil possession, a state of\ngrace in the legal owner. Thus God alone can confer evangelical\npossession (ibid., p. 45). On the other hand, a man in a\nstate of grace is lord of the visible universe, but on the condition\nthat he shares his lordship with all the other men who are in a state\nof grace, as all men in a state of grace have the same rights. This\nultimately means that all the goods of God should be in common, just\nas they were before the Fall. Private property was introduced as a\nresult of sin. From this point of view it is also evident that\nAristotle’s criticisms against Plato are unsound, since Platonic\ncommunism is correct in essence (ibid., pp. 96 ff.). The\npurpose of civil law is to preserve the necessities of life\n(ibid., pp. 128–29). The best form of government is\nmonarchy. Kings must be obeyed and have taxes paid to them, even if\nthey become tyrants, since they are God’s vicars that He alone\ncan depose — so that only secular lordship is justified in the\nworld (ibid., p. 201).","contact.mail":"alessandro.conti@cc.univaq.it","contact.domain":"cc.univaq.it"}]
