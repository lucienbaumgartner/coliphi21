He also\nspeaks of eternal and necessary truths that are the product of\nGod’s free and wholly unconstrained activity. One of the\ninterpretive projects that is inspired by Descartes’ sometimes\nprovocative claims about possibility and necessity is the construction\nof a general Cartesian theory of modality. Any such theory would of\ncourse need to be sensitive to all of the claims that Descartes makes\nthat bear on possibility and necessity, but it would also need to\nunderstand and interpret those claims in the light of the terminology\nand commitments of his larger metaphysical system.\n\nThough Descartes makes a number of claims about possibilities and\nnecessities, not all of them are to be considered in determining his\nviews on modality if we take seriously his view that when doing\nmetaphysics we ought not affirm what we do not clearly and distinctly\nperceive. Descartes reveals his commitment to this view in a number of\nplaces:  \nIf Descartes holds that when doing strict metaphysics we ought not\nspeak of what we do not clearly and distinctly perceive, a general\nCartesian theory of modality should not be sensitive to claims about\npossibilities or necessities that Descartes himself would identify as\nwholly confused. There are modal claims that seem intuitive and\nobvious, Descartes might say, and modal claims that actually are\nintuitive and obvious, and he would want his account of modality to\naccommodate only the latter.  \nIndeed, one reason why it is important to highlight the distinction\nbetween modal claims that are confused and modal claims that are not\nis that there are many modal claims that we might want to give a\nrigorous analysis but that Descartes would not. That is to say, the\naccount that he offers will not necessarily square with all of the\nmodal claims that we would advance pre-reflectively. For example, we\nmight observe a blue table in front of us and put forward the claim\nthat it is possible that the table not be blue and that it could have\nbeen black. Descartes himself is going to be careful about accepting\nsuch a claim at face-value. He subscribes to the view that strictly\nspeaking our senses “provide only very obscure\ninformation” (The Sixth Meditation, AT 7:84, CSM 2:58) about the\nbodies located outside of us. Our “knowledge of the truth of\nsuch things [located outside of us] seems to belong to the mind alone,\nnot to the combination of mind and body” (ibid., AT\n7:82–83, CSM 2:57), and what the mind perceives clearly about\nbodies are non-sensory qualities like extendedness and flexibility\n(The Second Meditation, AT 7:30–31, CSM 2:20). Or as he says\nelsewhere, the certainty that we seek in metaphysical inquiry\n“occurs in the clear perceptions of the intellect and nowhere\nelse” (Second Replies, AT 7:145, CSM 2:104). Returning\nnow to the claim that it is possible that a given table not be blue\nand that it could have been black, we need to keep in mind that on\nDescartes’ view colors are not in objects in the way that we\nnormally imagine them to be (Principles of Philosophy I.68,\nAT 8A:33, CSM 1:217). We might also advance the claim that our blue\ntable could occupy a different position in empty space, or the claim\nthat it could begin to move without being pushed into motion by a\ncause. The first claim supposes what Descartes denies – that\nthere is empty space (Principles II.10–12, AT\n8A:45–47, CSM 1:226–28) – and the second contradicts\na Cartesian law of motion that falls immediately out of our idea of\nGod (Principles II.36–37, AT 8A:61–63, CSM\n1:240–41; Nadler 1987). However the debate is resolved on these\nimportant systematic issues, it is important to keep in mind that\nDescartes’ theory of modality will be somewhat\n circumscribed.[2]\n His theory of modality will do justice to truths about possibility\nand truths about necessity, but much of what he takes to be possible\nor necessary is not what we would take to be possible or necessary at\nfirst glance. If we suppose that we are being charitable by allowing\nhis theory of modality to accommodate a modal claim that we are\ncertain is true, we might be foisting upon him an interpretation that\nhe would prefer to resist. No doubt he might be mistaken in what he\ntakes to be the set of true modal claims, but his account would end up\nbeing mindful of those and not any others. \nA related reason why it is important to highlight the distinction\nbetween modal claims that are confused and modal claims that are not\nis that in what is perhaps his most important and influential\nphilosophical work – Meditations on First Philosophy\n– Descartes often advances a claim that in the final analysis he\nrejects. He advances modal claims that he takes to be false, and many\nother claims that he advances he takes to be false as well. For\nexample, he says that what we know best we know either from or through\nthe senses (First Meditation, AT 7:18, CSM 2:17); that it is possible\nthat God is an extreme deceiver (CSM 2:19); that it is possible that\nGod does not exist (CSM 2:19); that it is possible that God, the\nsupreme being on whom all entities depend for their existence, has\nallowed the existence of an evil demon that is constantly deceiving\n(CSM 2:20); that we should use imagination to get to know our selves\nbetter (Second Meditation, AT 7:27, CSM 2:18); that general\nperceptions are apt to be more confused than particular ones\n(ibid., AT 7:30, CSM 2:20); that bodies literally possess\nqualities like color and taste and sound (ibid.) and heat\n(Third Meditation, AT 7:41, 43–44, CSM 2:28, 30–31); and\nthat the appropriate way to inquire into whether or not the works of\nGod are perfect is to examine the universe in its entirety (The Fourth\nMeditation, AT 7:55–56, CSM 2:38–39). Descartes does not\nsubscribe to a single one of these views. He thinks that upon further\nreflection we can recognize that God is a necessary existent and that\nit is impossible for Him to be a radical deceiver or to allow the\nexistence of a radical deceiver; that what is known best is known by\npurely mental scrutiny (Second Meditation, AT 7:31, CSM 2:21); that\ngeneral perceptions are more clear than perceptions of particulars\n(ibid.); that color and taste and sound and heat are not in\nbodies in anything like the way that we imagine (Sixth Meditation, AT\n7:81–83, CSM 2:56–58; Principles IV.198, AT\n8A:322–23, CSM 1:285); and that things are good by virtue of the\nfact that God wills them (Sixth Replies, AT 7:431–36,\nCSM 2:291–94). \nDescartes advances a number of claims that are false in the\nMeditations, but he does this for good reason. He is writing\nin the voice of a meditator who at the start of inquiry is not yet a\nCartesian and who in the course of inquiry is expressing views that\nseem to him to be true from his non-Cartesian point-of-view. The\nmeditator will express and evaluate these views and see for himself\nhow they collapse on their own weight. \nIt might seem surprising that as a philosopher Descartes ever flirts\nwith confusions at all. When he does so he is just employing his\nanalytic method – what he calls the “best and\ntruest method of instruction…” (Second Replies,\nAT 7:156, CSM 2:111). Descartes does not hide that he sometimes makes\nclaims early in the Meditations that from a later and more\nsophisticated point of view he will retract. He says, \nDescartes advances these claims because he is trying to teach his\nmetaphysics and because he thinks that his readers will not be in a\nposition to grasp that metaphysics if he only makes claims that are\n true.[4]\n Reflecting the epistemic individualism that is common in 17th-Century\nPhilosophy, Descartes insists that we should not accept a view until\nwe see its truth for ourselves (Appendix to Fifth Replies, AT\n9A:208, CSM 2:272–73). But he also holds that at the start of\ninquiry our conceptions and commitments are way off. Most of us are\ninclined to affirm that what we know best we know through the senses,\nalong with the other falsities already mentioned, but in addition: our\nconceptions of mind and God represent mind and God as sensible when\nthey are not; we think and speak by way of terms that we do not\nunderstand or that may have no corresponding idea; and what we take to\nbe the paradigm of a distinct perception is hardly distinct at\n all.[5]\n We take in information against the background of our current\ncommitments and conceptions, and so are primed to reject what\nconflicts with\n them.[6]\n When we work through the Meditations from the first-person\npoint-of-view, we accept or reject things when we see for ourselves\nthat they are to be accepted or rejected, but until our intellects are\nemended we do not have the best perspective from which to see the\ntruth. \nDescartes sees little alternative to proceeding as he does. If he just\nasserts the claims that he is certain are true, other individuals who\nare in a position to see those claims as obvious will recognize their\ntruth, but these are not necessarily the individuals whom Descartes is\ntrying to reach. He is also trying to reach a much larger set of\nindividuals: those who disagree with him, and who disagree with him\ndeeply. He must say something to these people, but if they are not in\na position to see the true, he will have to meet them where they are\nor else they will not be prepared to engage. About the many false\nclaims that Descartes puts forward in the Meditations, he\nwrites  \nIn Second Replies Descartes makes a distinction\nbetween the simple and primary notions of metaphysics – which\nare not derivable from anything – and other truths that can be\ngenerated from these (CSM 2:104, 111). A dilemma that he highlights is\nthat if a person is so confused that they do not recognize the truth\nof primary notions, it is not clear what to say to them. The primary\nnotions are not derived from other notions – that is\nwhat makes them simple and fundamental – and so they cannot be\ndemonstrated or argued for, but if the philosopher just repeats them,\nthat won’t do much good either. A further dilemma, according to\nDescartes, is that primary notions often contradict the everyday\nworldview to which most of us subscribe uncritically (CSM\n2:111–112). If so, we are primed to reject the primary notions\nof metaphysics and the further disorienting conclusions that they\nentail. A philosopher like Descartes needs to say something\nto his audience – to get them to see the force of his view\n– but ironically enough, the truth will not cut it, at least not\nat first. What Descartes does, then, is to employ a version of the\nanalytic method of ancient geometry, in which claims are made that\nstrictly speaking are false but that help a student to see\n(eventually) what is true. In the First Meditation especially,\nDescartes will advance claims that are false but that he anticipates\nhis readers will find plausible: we will think through the\nimplications of these claims in a way that puts us on course to arrive\nat a clear and distinct grasp of the primary notions of metaphysics.\nOn the way Descartes will make claims – including modal claims\n– that range from false to incoherent, but later on we will be\nin a position to juxtapose these against the obvious truths at which\nwe have arrived, and our earlier claims will be seen for the\nconfusions that they are.\n\n \nFor example, in the First Meditation Descartes entertains a number of\npossibilities to the effect that we might be mistaken about results\nthat are perfectly evident to us. One such possibility is that we have\nbeen created by a supremely good God but that, for reasons unbeknownst\nto us, our nature is such that we “go wrong every time [we] add\ntwo and three or count the sides of a square, or in some even simpler\nmatter” (AT 7:21, CSM 2:14). Another is that we have not been\ncreated by God but have “arrived at [our] present state by fate\nor chance or a continuous chain of events” (AT 7:21, CSM 2:14).\nA third is that we are constantly deceived by a malicious demon (AT\n7:22, CSM 2:15). Descartes mentions all of these possibilities to set\nup his Third Meditation point that until we know what made our minds,\nwe are not in a position to trust them and so not in a position to\nknow anything at all (AT 7:36, CSM 2:25). None of these is an actual\npossibility, though Descartes allows that we may not appreciate this\nuntil later: \nDescartes allows that if we are careless or not paying attention, we\ncan entertain the supposition that “God” does not exist or is a\ndeceiver, but he holds that upon reflection the supreme being is a\nnecessary existent, and a necessary existent that cannot deceive (The\nFifth Meditation, CSM 2:46–48). We might have thought otherwise\nat the start of inquiry, before we had carefully unpacked and examined\nour concepts – at a moment when we were not yet putting forward\na priori non-sensory claims, which are the only sort of claim that are\nsuitable as premises in a metaphysical argument. As often happens in\nphilosophy, we come to recognize that there are things that seem clear\nto us before we have thought them through, and we recognize that the\nreason why they seemed clear was that we hadn’t thought them\nthrough yet. As Descartes himself writes,  \nWhen we construct arguments on the basis of basic a priori principles\nof metaphysics – what Descartes calls “primary\nnotions” (Second Replies, AT 7:145–46, CSM 2:104;\nPrinciples I.50, AT 8A:23–24, CSM 1:209) – and\nnot the non a priori premises that constitute much of the early\nthinking of Descartes’ meditator, we recognize that God is a\nnecessary existent who cannot deceive and also that He is the\nindependent and supreme creator of all reality, both possible and\nactual (“To [Mesland], 2 May 1644,” AT 4:118–19,\nCSMK 235; “To [Mersenne], 27 May 1630,” AT 1:152, CSMK 25;\nThird Meditation, AT 7:45, CSM 2:31). If so, we know on a priori\ngrounds that the possibilities introduced in the First Meditation are\nfictional and indeed are not possibilities at all. It turns out, upon\nreflection, that God did not create them. This is not just to say that\nthe possibilities exist but do not obtain. To say that a possibility\nexists but does not obtain would be to say that it exists as a\npossibility that is not actualized; it would be to say that in\naddition to actual reality there also exists possible reality and that\nsome possible reality is never actualized. If in Descartes’s\nsystem God created only actual reality and not in addition any\npossible reality, then possibilities themselves are not real –\nthey have no ontological status and so are not in fact possibilities,\nbecause they are not anything. God did not create the possibility that\nwe exist with minds that might be certain of things that are false; He\ndid not create the possibility that we evolved from chance; He did not\ncreate the possibility of an evil demon. None of these possibilities\nexists automatically, and they do not exist just because the cognitive\ndeliverances of the First Meditation meditator tell us that they do.\nWhen we (or the meditator) postulated their existence in the First\nMeditation, we were being hasty, and all that we had to go on at that\nearly stage of inquiry was our confused pre-Meditations\nconceptions. \nWe might wonder though if Descartes would be happy to identify the\npossibilities of the First Meditation as epistemic\npossibilities, even if they are not real possibilities. After all, the\nmeditator is entertaining doubts in the First Meditation, and she is\nhonestly reporting that because she is not yet certain that God exists\nor is not a deceiver, for all she knows God might not exist exist or\nmight be a deceiver. She concludes that it is possible that God does\nnot exist and that it is possible that He is a deceiver, and indeed\nboth of those claims, in the sense in which they are uttered, would\nappear to be true at the moment that she utters them. It certainly\nseems as though the meditator is saying something true when she\nexpresses that for all she knows God is a deceiver (or does not\nexist), but a complication arises when we consider Descartes’\nown view that a mind is not really thinking of God if they are\nimagining an extremely powerful being that is a deceiver\n(“Letter to Voetius,” May 1643, CSMK 222, cited above).\nNor are we thinking of God if we have an imagistic idea of a giant man\non a cloud (Fifth Replies, CSM 2:252), and we are not\nthinking of mind or self if we have an imagistic idea of air or fire\n(Fifth Replies, CSM 2:264). Regardless of how we might report\nor describe our own thinking in such cases, those just are not the\nthings that we have in mind. If so, a question arises about whether or\nnot Descartes would want to allow that the First Meditation\npossibility that (for example) God is a deceiver is in fact the\nepistemic possibility that (for all the First Meditation meditator\nknows) God might be a deceiver. He would be reluctant to allow this, I\nthink, because he is committed to saying that the First Meditation\nmeditator who thinks of God as a deceiver is not thinking of God at\nall. But even if Descartes did want to speak in line with common sense\nand accept the First Meditation meditator’s understanding of\ntheir own thought processes, he would still conclude that none of the\npossibilities of the First Meditation is a real possibility. \nDescartes is very explicit about the importance of employing (what\nsome might regard as a not completely honest) pedagogical method. In\norder to maneuver his readers into a position in which they\nare able to understand his metaphysics, he needs to help them\nto clear up their ideas. If he simply tells us his view, we will hear\nit against the background of confused ideas that (on his view) it is\nimperative we discard. The view that we would walk away with would not\nbe Descartes’ view but something else. Descartes therefore opts\nfor a special strategy for presenting his metaphysics: he puts things\nin terms of the confusions that we understand, otherwise we will not\nunderstand him. If we object (as does Gassendi) to this kind of\nmaneuver, Descartes insists that under the circumstances it is only\nappropriate. He does not see anything objectionable in guiding us to\ntruth by way of conceptions that are false or incoherent. Instead, he\nis providing a service: \nThe possibilities that Descartes mentions early in the\nMeditations are not a part of his ontology. When he talks\nabout these, he is not interested in truth but, rather, in helping his\nreader to move through and past\n confusion.[7]\n Unless we are going to saddle Descartes with the view that it really\nis possible that our minds are radically defective and that\nnonetheless we ought to go on reasoning anyway, we should\nconclude that Descartes holds that the possibilities of the First\nMeditation were never created and that hence they are nothing at\nall. \nDescartes is infamous for his doctrine of the creation of the eternal\ntruths:  \nOn the surface the position is baffling, especially when considered in\nconjunction with Descartes’ view that God is omnipotent. The\nauthor of Fifth Objections, Pierre Gassendi, complained that\nthe view is very difficult to conceive. Descartes’ reply is\ninteresting:  \nDescartes holds that each and every thing depends on God for its\nexistence and that, as things, eternal truths depend on God as well.\nOne of Gassendi’s worries is that if God can do anything and\nthus can alter any item that He creates, nothing that He creates is\nimmutable. \nAnother reason that Descartes’ view is difficult to conceive is\nthat Descartes takes eternal truths to be necessary. That is, it is\ndifficult to conceive how eternal truths could be necessary if they\nwere created by a free act of God. Descartes is clear that the eternal\ntruths are necessary: he says that “the necessity of these\ntruths does not surpass our knowledge” (“To Mersenne, 6\nMay 1630,” AT 1:150, CSMK 25). If eternal truths are necessary,\nhowever, it should not be the case that they could have been\notherwise. Yet Descartes’ commitment to divine omnipotence\nappears to commit him to this view: \nIt appears that something in Descartes’ comments about the\neternal truths has to give. It might be that, since Descartes is\nclearly not prepared to adjust his commitment to divine omnipotence,\nhe instead has to abandon his view that they are\n necessary.[8]\n On this interpretation, developed and defended by Harry Frankfurt,\nall eternal truths are inherently contingent because they could have\nbeen false, and they could have been false because God could have made\ntheir contradictories true. Frankfurt’s interpretation is\nmotivated not only by Descartes’ commitment to divine\nomnipotence; there are also some texts: \nIf Frankfurt is right, Cartesian eternal truths are not really\nnecessary; they “are inherently as contingent as any other\npropositions” (42). They may appear to be necessary to our\nrational faculties, but this is just a function of the makeup of our\nrational faculties and not of the necessity of the truths themselves.\nFrankfurt then argues more generally that Descartes holds that for all\nwe know our rational faculties may be wrong about other things as\nwell. After all, we are mistaken about the necessity of the eternal\ntruths, which seems so very obvious, and so we might might be mistaken\nabout anything else that is similarly evident. If Frankfurt is\ncorrect, Descartes holds that there is a way that reality appears from\nthe viewpoint of the clearest of human reasoning, and the best that we\ncan do as rational agents is to take up that viewpoint. But we can\nnever get outside of it to see how things are\n absolutely.[11] \nIf Descartes holds that eternal truths are necessary in any robust\nsense, Frankfurt’s view has an obvious drawback. It also suffers\nfrom the problem that it [Frankfurt’s view] cannot be formulated\nwithout supposing that Descartes allows that there is a human\nperspective from which eternal truths can be seen to be non-necessary,\nbut an important component of Frankfurt’s view is the thesis\nthat Descartes thinks that it is part of the structure of a human mind\nto regard eternal truths as wholly necessary. \nThe most serious drawback for Frankfurt’s view, however, is that\nit is self-contradictory in postulating that, according to Descartes,\nwe cannot make claims about what reality is like absolutely. On\nFrankfurt’s view, Descartes holds that God is omnipotent in the\nsense that He can do anything at all and has authority over even the\neternal truths. That is to say, Descartes holds that it is\ntrue that God is omnipotent in this sense. Descartes then\nconcludes that the eternal truths could have been other than they are\nand hence are not necessary; they just appear to be necessary to\nfinite human minds. Indeed, to a finite human mind it is\nobvious that eternal truths like that 2+2=4 are necessary,\neven though we are mistaken and 2+2=4 is just as contingent as any\nother truth. Frankfurt then concludes that for Descartes what is\nmaximally obvious to a clear-thinking finite mind is no more than that\n– it is what is maximally obvious to a finite mind, and it is\nnot a guarantee of actual truth. However, Frankfurt cannot generate\nthe result that for Descartes it is false that the eternal truths are\nnecessary, or the result that eternal truths are as contingent as any\nother truths, unless he supposes on Descartes’s behalf that it\nis actually true that God is omnipotent in the sense that he\n[Frankfurt] specifies.  \nAn alternative view (developed and defended by Edwin Curley) is that\nDescartes holds that eternal truths are necessary, but that they are\nnot necessarily so. On this reading, Descartes’ view involves\niterated modalities: a number of truths are possibly necessary, but\nGod chooses only some of these possibilities to be the actual\nnecessary\n truths.[12]\n One of the passages that supports such a reading is from the\nalready-cited letter to Mesland: \nOn Curley’s reading, Descartes secures the necessity of eternal\ntruths by arguing that God willed them to be necessary, and hence it\ncan be said that it is false that they could have been otherwise. But\nDescartes also holds that God created the possibility that they not be\nnecessary, and that is why they are not necessarily necessary, as it\ncould have been the case that they could have been otherwise. Some\ncommentators have argued that a problem for Curley’s view is\nthat it cannot allow Descartes to hold that eternal truths are\nabsolutely necessary – if it could have been the case that a\ngiven truth could have been otherwise, then it is not a necessary\n truth.[14]\n Curley indeed admits that, on his view, Descartes was confused about\nthe modal status of eternal truths (Curley 1984, 589). They might be\nhypothetically necessary, but nothing more than that. Another problem\nis that Curley’s view appears to put a severe constraint on\ndivine omnipotence: if God wants to make an eternal truth false, He\ncannot make it false without first willing that it not be necessary,\nfor a necessary truth cannot be made false. If God alters the status\nof the truth so that it is no longer a necessary truth, He can make it\nfalse, but He cannot make it false straightaway. A final problem is\nthat Curley’s reading supposes that there is some point at which\nGod’s will could have been otherwise, but God is eternal, and\npart of His essential perfection is to be wholly immutable\n(Principles II.36, AT 8A:62). \nAn alternative reading of Descartes’ comments on the eternal\ntruths suggests still another interpretation. Jonathan Bennett has\npointed out that in some of the key passages in question Descartes\ndoes not say that God can make contradictories true, but that we\nshould not say that God cannot make contradictories true (Bennett\n1994, 653–55). In such passages, for example in the\nalready-cited 1648 letter to Arnauld, Descartes is not saying anything\nabout God’s power but about us and what we ought not say.\nPresumably, he is just invoking his Fourth Meditation rule for judging\nin these passages, as he is very explicit that when we do metaphysics\nwe ought not affirm what we do not clearly and distinctly\n understand.[15]\n Since we do not come close to understanding what it would be for one\nand two to add up to something other than three, and since we do not\nunderstand God’s being unable to do something, the prospect that\nGod cannot make 1 and 2 not add to 3 is hopelessly confused.\nAccordingly, we ought not speak of it. The same analysis also applies\nto the important passage in the Mesland letter. Immediately after\nsaying that God can make contradictories true together, Descartes\ntakes it back: “… even if this be true, we should not try\nto comprehend it, since our nature is incapable of doing so.”\nDescartes’ claim that God can make contradictories true is\nsomething that we ought not affirm when doing metaphysics and thus\nsomething that should have no bearing on our interpretation of\nDescartes’ system. \nBennett is right to emphasize the passages in which Descartes says of\na number of incoherent states of affairs that we ought not say that\nGod cannot bring them about. Bennett extends his view in ways that\nlead to some of the same problems that arose for Frankfurt, however.\nAccording to Bennett, Descartes does not take true modal claims to\napply or conform to real possibilities or necessities. In particular,\nthey do not apply to God. Instead, modality is just a function of how\nour minds have been constructed. Bennett thus arrives at a conclusion\nthat is similar to the one in Frankfurt, but from a different point of\ndeparture. Frankfurt supposes that for Descartes God is omnipotent in\nsuch a way that He can make eternal truths false, and thus that for\nany truth that we find to be necessary, its necessity is merely\napparent. But Bennett does not think that any modal truths\npertain to God. He grounds his interpretation on a text in which\nDescartes appears to offer the conceptualist account straightaway: \nBennett also relies on the set of passages in which Descartes says\nthat what we take to be necessary or possible is a function of how our\nminds have been structured, and that our minds might have been\nstructured in such a way that we would have found other things to be\nnecessary or possible instead (Bennett 1994, 656–658). Like\nFrankfurt, Bennett concludes that any claims that we make about God\nand His necessary existence, or about the impossibility of His being a\ndeceiver, are not a reflection of real possibilities and necessities\nthat pertain to God, but just a reflection of our minds and how we are\ncompelled to think. A worry for Bennett (which was also raised for\nFrankfurt) is that Descartes appears to want to secure the actual\nnecessity of eternal truths, and that he appears to want his\nepistemology to yield results that are true absolutely speaking. But\neven if we are not so concerned about this worry, and we suppose that\nDescartes is not interested in absolute truth, a textual concern for\nBennett is that in the passage that he takes to be the “strongest\nevidence for [his] reading” (Bennett 1994, 647) Descartes does not\nsay that possibility has no relation to the “object itself.” He\nsays that any serious account of possibility must coincide with what\nour concepts tell us is possible; otherwise, there would be no way for\nour minds to know possibility, and “every other item of human\nknowledge… [would be] undermine[d]” as a result. This is an\nevidential misfire, but even worse – Bennett’s interpretation\nsupposes that there is an unbridgeable gap between what we take to be\ntrue and what is actually true, and as such it would appear to\nundermine all human knowledge from the very start. It rules out all\nhuman knowledge from the start by supposing that for Descartes we can\nnever obtain any assurance that our clearest and most compelling\nperceptions of reality correspond to the way that reality is in fact.\nIf there is an interpretation of Descartes according to which there is\nno such gap, Cartesian knowledge would have at least some chance at\nvindication. \nLilli Alanen has proposed an interpretation along these lines. She\nobjects to all of the views considered above: if they do not downplay\nthe necessity of Descartes’ eternal truths by making them merely\nhypothetical, the interpretations eliminate their necessity altogether\nand at the same time commit Descartes to saying that best we can do\nepistemologically speaking is to arrive at results that seem to be\ntrue from human our point-of-view (Alanen 2008, 359–364). Alanen\nherself concludes that in Descartes’s system there are necessary\ntruths that are fully necessary and that have been authored by God.\nShe adds, however, that our understanding of divine activity is\nlimited in such a way that we have no understanding of how necessities\n(or possibilities) could be the product of His free will\n(Ibid., 364–367). A fulcrum point of Alanen’s view is that\nthere are no modal claims that apply to divine activity because God is\nalways the author of any modal claims and hence they are always the\nsubsequent product of that activity: \nAlanen argues that for Descartes we are being hasty if we attempt to\npoint to considerations that we do not at all understand – for\nexample divine activity and any modalities that we think might apply\nto it – and if we then appeal to those considerations as a basis\nfor understanding the necessity of eternal truths. But that does not\nmean that we should conclude that truths about the necessary and the\npossible are merely subjective. Eternal truths like that two and two\nadd to four are in fact necessary, even if we do not understand the\nbackstory of God’s production of them (Ibid., 365–367). \nAlanen’s view is ingenious, but a serious worry that arises for it\nis that Descartes appears to hold (and without the slightest bit of\nequivocation) that there are modal claims that pertain to God and that\nare useful for explicating His behavior. For example, we conclude in\nthe Fourth Meditation that God cannot be a deceiver and therefore that\nwhatever we clearly and distinctly perceive is true. We would also\nappear to be entitled to include that because God is wholly immutable,\nthe laws of nature are utterly constant (Principles of\nPhilosophy II.36, CSM 1:240). Alanen is certainly right that none\nof the necessary truths that God wills would apply to His activity,\nbut that does not mean that no modal notions at all apply to His\nactivity – especially if Descartes himself makes so clear that\ndivine immutability and the impossibility of divine deception are data\nthat are to guide us in inquiry. And they are not simply guides in the\nsense of regulative principles or heuristics. We cannot once and for\nall lay down a result, for Descartes, unless we recognize that it is\ntrue that God exists and that it is impossible for Him to be\na deceiver.  \nAnother attempt to preserve the necessity of eternal truths in\nDescartes’ system is is to run with such data and argue that if\nGod wills a truth for eternity and His will is wholly immutable, the\ntruth is eternal and necessary, and there does not exist the\npossibility that it be otherwise. Such a possibility would not exist\nautomatically – for it would only exist if God created it\n– and if Descartes holds that eternal truths are necessary, that\nis a signal that he supposes that God never created that possibility\nat all. \nOne important passage is in the 1644 letter to Mesland (quoted above)\nin which Descartes says that “God cannot have been determined to\nmake it true that contradictories be true together, and therefore that\nhe could have done the opposite.” As has already been noted, later\nin the paragraph he takes it all back:  \nThere are similar passages elsewhere in Descartes’ corpus, where the\nview that Descartes that takes himself to be able to express, and to\nexpress intelligibly, is that “there is always a single identical\nand perfectly simple act by means of which he [God] simultaneously\nunderstands, wills, and accomplishes everything.” If God is wholly\nimmutable and wills the truths of mathematics and geometry in a single\nact for eternity, it would appear that we are entitled to infer the\nresult that those truths are necessary, just like we can infer from\nthe impossibility of divine deception that our clear and distinct\nperceptions are true. We might also consider the Third Meditation\npassage in which Descartes says that in God there is absolutely\nnothing that is potential (AT 7:47, CSM 2:32). If there is just a\nsingle activity in God, and if it is simple and eternal, and also\nimmutable, then it makes no sense to talk of God as changing course\nand actualizing an alternative set of possibilities aside from than\nthe one that actually obtains. There do not exist alternative possible\neternal truths, and there does not exist the possibility of a change\nin God’s eternal and immutable will, and so (contra Frankfurt et\nal) eternal truths are absolutely necessary. \nA final consideration to mention in favor of the view that Descartes\nholds that eternal truths are absolutely necessary is that it is\nsensitive to the important worry raised by Broughton (1987) and Nadler\n(1987) – that if Descartes holds that the eternal truths of\nmathematics, etc., could have been otherwise, then he is committed to\nthe conclusion that physical laws admit of more necessity than (for\nexample) the truth that two and two add to four. Descartes is clear\nthat physical laws follow from God’s nature (for example\nPrinciples II.36–37, CSM 1:240–241), and so they\nare absolutely necessary, but that would mean that he supposes that\nphysical laws are more necessary than eternal truths. If anything, we\nwould expect the story to go the other way around – that eternal\ntruths would be necessary and that physical laws would be wholly\ncontingent. In Descartes’ system it would appear that laws of\nphysics are necessary and that eternal truths are necessary as\nwell. \nStill, we need to contend with the passage in which Descartes says\nthat God was free to make the radii of a circle unequal, and with the\npassages in which Descartes says more generally that God is free with\nrespect to each and every thing that He does. One way to read these\npassages is to make the assumption that Descartes has a libertarian\nconception of divine freedom and then conclude that if Descartes says\nthat God is free to do something, there exists the possibility that He\ndo it and also the possibility that He do something else (perhaps the\n opposite).[16]\n Descartes himself appears to understand divine freedom in very\ndifferent terms, however. He writes, \nDescartes holds that God is free in creating the eternal truth about\nthe radii of a circle. If God’s freedom in this and other cases\njust consists in His complete indifference and independence, then the\nCartesian claim that God is free to do x does not entail that\nthere exists the possibility that God not do x or that there\nexists the possibility that God do something else. As Descartes makes\nvery clear, such possibilities exist only if God takes the extra step\nof creating them. \nDescartes makes a number of otherwise puzzling claims about\nGod’s freedom to create the eternal truths, but if we interpret\nthese in the light of Descartes’ stated conception of divine\nfreedom, they begin to look fairly mundane. A problem, however, is\nthat taken together the claims encourage the reading that Descartes is\na necessitarian. We consider for example the following comment that\nDescartes makes to Mersenne: \nHere Descartes allows that there exists the possibility that God\ncreate alternate eternal truths only if God’s will is mutable,\nbut of course Descartes holds that God’s will is wholly\nimmutable, and immutable for eternity. God is still free of course,\nbut in a way that squares with His immutability: divine freedom is to\nbe understood in terms of indifference and independence. The worry\nthat is starting to arise is that if God is the immutable and eternal\nauthor of all reality – the eternal truths and everything else\nthat exists – then there does not exist the possibility that God\nwill an alternate series of creatures, and hence God does not author\nthat possibility, but instead everything that happens happens\nnecessarily. Descartes subscribes to a version of the Spinozistic view\nthat divine freedom is a matter of\n indifference,[17]\n and there is also some systematic evidence that Descartes accepts the\nSpinozistic doctrine of necessitarianism. As Descartes recognizes in\nthe 15 April 30 letter to Mersenne, we might encounter some cognitive\ndissonance in recognizing God’s freedom as\n omnipotence.[18]\n He appears to subscribe to the view that the eternal truths are\nnecessary and that everything else that happens is necessary as\n well.[19]\n As he is reported to have said in Conversation with\nBurman: \nWe must repeat again, however, that this latter passage is from\nConversation with Burman, which was an interview in which\nDescartes reported his views, and not a primary text that Descartes\nwrote himself. The view that Descartes puts forward in the passage is\nvery much in line with the texts in which Descartes says that God is\nsimple and immutable, and creates by way of a single unchanging act\nfor all eternity, and indeed it pushes those texts to their logical\nconclusion. The passage is from an interview, however, and some might\nworry that it is not fully authoritative. \nIf Descartes holds in the final analysis that everything that happens\nhappens necessarily, it is easy to see how he can hold that eternal\ntruths are necessary and created by a God that is free (in the\nCartesian sense). However, Descartes will still have to contend with\nthe objection that there are texts in which he seems to be committed\nto the existence of unactualized possibilities and, in particular,\ntexts in which he appears to be committed to a non-compatibilist view\nof human\n freedom.[20]\n This objection will be discussed in sections four and six below.  \nThus far we have considered the interpretive issue of whether or not\nDescartes’ eternal truths could have been otherwise. A question\nthat still remains to be considered concerns the ontological status of\nDescartes’ eternal truths, regardless of whether or not they\ncould have been otherwise. \nOne view is that since Descartes’ eternal truths are neither\nfinite mental things, finite physical things, nor God, they must be\nsomething akin to Platonic\n forms.[21]\n A problem with this view, of course, is that it does violence to\nDescartes’ parsimonious dualism. Another problem with the view\nis that Descartes says that eternal truths are beings which\n“have no existence outside our thought”\n(Principles I.48, AT 8A:23, CSM 1:208). \nA second view is that eternal truths are to be located in\n God.[22]\n One of the merits of this view is that it provides for eternal truths\nto be eternal in a very robust sense. God is eternal, and anything\nelse is eternal if it is housed in His eternal mind. Still, the view\nconflicts with the fact that Descartes holds that eternal truths are\ncreatures and are housed in finite minds only. \nA third reading of Descartes on eternal truths is that they are ideas\nin finite minds. If truth is the conformity of thought with its object\n(“To Mersenne, 16 October 1639,” AT 2:597, CSMK 139), then\neternal truths are ideas. But Descartes has also said that eternal\ntruths have no existence outside of our thought. They are true ideas,\nbut not true ideas in the mind of God because eternal truths are\ncreatures. A problem with this third reading, however, is that,\nalthough it allows eternal truths to be truths, it is not\nclear that it allows them to be\n eternal.[23]\n In some passages Descartes does distance himself from the appellation\n‘eternal truth’: he refers to “those truths which\nare called eternal” (“To Mersenne, 27 May 1638,” AT\n2:138, CSMK 103) and to “[t]he mathematical truths which you\ncall eternal” (To Mersenne, 15 April 1630, AT 1:145, CSMK 23).\nAnd he allows that things can be identified as ‘eternal’\nso long as they “are always the same” (Fifth\nReplies, AT 7:381, CSM 2:262). So a deflationary view of the\neternality of Cartesian eternal truths might be in order. However,\nDescartes says to Mersenne that “from all eternity [God] willed\nthem [eternal truths] to be, and by that very fact he created\nthem” (“To [Mersenne], 27 May 1630,” AT 1:152, CSMK\n25). Descartes as a rule shies away from making claims about\ntheological matters, but it is not clear that we want to attribute to\nhim the view that finite minds are co-eternal with \n God.[24]\n Perhaps he holds that human minds exist at every point in the series\nthat God wills, or perhaps his understanding of the eternality of\neternal truths is more deflationary: God wills a single series for all\neternity, and that series includes unchanging true ideas in finite\nminds. \nDescartes is unambiguous that there are some things that we clearly\nand distinctly perceive to be possible. To Mersenne he speaks of\nbeings whose existence we clearly perceive to be possible (“To\nMersenne, March 1642,” AT 3:544–45, CSMK 211); he also\nsays that God “can bring about everything that I clearly and\ndistinctly recognize as possible” (Fourth Replies, AT\n7:219, CSM 2:154). In First Replies he says that \nIn addition, he says to Mesland that “our mind is finite and so\ncreated as to be able to perceive as possible things which God has\nwished to be in fact\n possible.”[26]\n The interpretive issue here is what Descartes is talking about when\nhe speaks in such terms. One interpretation that immediately suggests\nitself is that Descartes holds that there are things or states of\naffairs that, though not actual, are counterfactually\n possible.[27]\n A number of considerations speak in favor of such a reading. One is\nthat Descartes’ view that mind and body are really distinct\nappears to be the view that minds and bodies that are in fact united\ncan exist\n apart.[28]\n Another is that Descartes says that we have clear and distinct\nperceptions of possible existence and of what is possible, thus making\nit appear that he holds that God’s creatures include not only\nactuals but also unactualized\n possibles.[29]\n Finally, this sort of reading fits Descartes within a long tradition\nof figures like Scotus and Bradwardine who posit possible being to\nsecure the meaning and reference of claims about things that could be\nbut\n aren’t.[30]\n If Descartes wants to make claims about unactualized possibles and if\nhe does not want those claims to be non-sensical, unactualized\npossibles need to have some kind of ontological status in his\nsystem. \nDescartes may in fact be committed to attributing reality to\nunactualized possibles, but a few interpretive problems arise if he\ndoes. One is that Descartes says elsewhere that unactualized being is\nnothing. In the Third Meditation, he argues that the objective reality\nof the idea of God cannot have been caused by potential perfections\ntowards which a finite being might be evolving because potentialities\nare nothing and so have no causal power. He says, \nIf Descartes holds that potential being is nothing, then it is\ndifficult to see how he can include unactualized possibles in his\nontology. \nAnother interpretive problem is that it is difficult to see exactly\nwhere possible reality would fit into Descartes’ ontology. For\nDescartes, all reality depends for its existence on God – even\npossible reality (“To [Mesland], 2 May 1644,” AT\n4:118–9, CSMK 235). A possible being is thus a creature with an\nontological status. Descartes holds that truth is the conformity of\nthought with its object, that “[t]ruth consists in being”\n(“To Clerselier, 23 April 1649,” AT 5:356, CSMK 377), and\nthat true ideas are “ideas of real things” (The Third\nMeditation, AT 7:43, CSM 2:30). Clear and distinct perceptions of\npossibilities conform to reality and are of real things; they have a\ntruth-maker. A clearly and distinctly perceived possibility has some\nontological status, and the question is what exactly that is. This is\na question on which the Descartes literature has been largely silent,\nbut the options would appear to be that possibilities are either\ncreatures or ideas in the mind of God. \nIf possible beings are creatures, there is some difficulty in making\nroom for them in Descartes’ ontology. Descartes is fairly clear\nthat the only creatures that exist are finite minds and bodies and\ntheir modes: \nOne category of being in Descartes’ ontology is thinking\nsubstance (and its modes), and another is extended substance (and its\nmodes). If Descartes’ possibles are just created thinking or\nextended substances, then presumably they are actuals and not\npossibles. \nOf course, one might suggest that Descartes’ dualism entails\nthat there are two kinds of things – thinking things and\nmaterial things – but that in each of these classes there are\nsubstances with actual existence and also substances with possible\nexistence. On such a view, the class of thinking substances (for\nexample) includes thinking substances with actual existence and\nthinking substances with possible existence. \nThere are a couple of problems with this view, however. One is that\nDescartes holds that it follows from God’s essence that God is\neternal and that His will is wholly immutable (The Third Meditation,\nAT 7:45, CSM 2:31; Principles I.56, AT 8A:26, CSM 1:211;\n“To Mersenne, 15 April 1630,” AT 1:145–6, CSMK 23;\nPrinciples II:36, AT 8A:61, CSM 1:24). If it is a necessary\ntruth that God is eternal and that His will is immutable, then there\ndoes not exist the possibility that God’s eternal will could\nhave been other than it is. So that possibility does not exist; and\nneither does it appear that there exist any possible creatures.\nDescartes holds that there is a single series that God preordains and\nthat is (as would be expected) immutable (Principles\nI.40–41, AT 8A:20, CSM 1:206). If God created things that were\nmerely possible, it is unclear how He would be able to actualize them\ninstead of the things that are actualized in the series, if none of\nthe requisite possibilities exist, and so it is unclear how they would\nconstitute possibilities. These alleged possibilities (if\nthey are anything) would be among all of the other creatures; they\nwould be actuals. \nIt might of course be the case that Descartes just insists that there\nare possible existents in addition to actual existents. Alternately,\nit might be the case that like Spinoza (in Ethics Part IV,\ndefinitions three and four), Descartes uses the expression\n“possible existence” to describe actually-existing\ncreatures, and in a way that is consistent with a denial of non-actual\nreality. For example, in some places Descartes identifies things as\nhaving possible existence to highlight that they are dependent\ncreatures, and creatures whose existence cannot be read straight from\ntheir concept. To describe the kind of existence had by finite\ncreatures generally, he uses ‘possible existence’ and\n‘contingent existence’ interchangeably: he sometimes\nspeaks of the beings that depend on God for their existence as having\n“possible or contingent existence” (Second\nReplies, AT 7:166, CSM 2:117; Notae, AT 8B:361, CSM\n1:306), and sometimes he speaks of them as having just\n“contingent existence” (Principles I.15, AT\n8A:10, CSM 1:198). When he says that creatures have possible\nor contingent existence, he identifies the two kinds of\nexistence: “possible or [vel] contingent\nexistence.” If contingent existence is just the kind of\nexistence had by beings that depend for their existence on God’s\nwill and whose existence cannot be established by an analysis of their\nconcept alone (Fifth Meditation, AT 7:63–66, CSM 2:44–46;\nRules for the Direction of the Mind, AT 10:421–22, CSM\n1:45–46), then the fact that a thing has possible existence in\nDescartes’ ontology does not suggest that the thing does not\nactually exist. Such a thing exists, but in a way that has it wholly\ndependent on God. Descartes also suggests this definition of\n“possible existence” when he contrasts necessary existence\nwith the kind of existence had by creatures in First Replies:\nunlike necessary existence, the existence had by a creature is marked\nby the fact that it “has no power to create itself or maintain\nitself in existence” (AT 7:118, CSM 2:84). It might be that like\nsome of his predecessors Descartes is using ‘possible\nexistence’ to describe a kind of being had by actually existing\n things.[32] \nIf possibilities are not creatures that exist in addition to thinking\nsubstances and extended substances, another interpretive option is to\nsay that they are ideas in the mind of God, but that God does not\nactualize. This interpretive option is precluded by Descartes’\ncommitment to the identity of God’s will, intellect, and\ncreative activity: \nA philosopher like Leibniz will insist on a distinction between\nGod’s understanding and will so as to secure the existence of\nthings in God’s understanding that God does not actually create.\nA philosopher like Spinoza will point out that a thinker who is\ncommitted to the identity of God’s will and intellect is\ncommitted to the view that there is nothing that God understands that\nGod does not create. Spinoza will add that such a thinker is not\nrestricting God’s omnipotence if God is the cause of all being\nand if alleged unactualized possibilities are outside the scope of\nGod’s intellect and will. Descartes appears to be siding with\nSpinoza here: what is not the object of God’s\nunderstanding is nothing at all, and what is the object of God’s\nunderstanding is created and made\n actual.[33]\n If Descartes is seriously committed to the identity of God’s\nintellect and will, it is difficult to see how he can also be\ncommitted to the existence of unactualized possibles. \nThere are a number of passages in which Descartes speaks of what is\npossible. To fix an interpretation of these passages, we can look to a\nnumber of different places. One is common-sense. We might argue that\nany view is crazy that does not admit that there are things that could\nhappen or exist but that do not. Since Descartes is not crazy, what he\nmust mean when he speaks of the possible is unactualized being. Or, we\nmight argue that Descartes is continuing in the tradition of thinkers\nwho clearly do posit unactualized possibles. If these figures\ninclude unactualized being within their ontologies, and if Descartes\nis building on their work, then his claims about the possible are\nabout unactualized being. Or, we might attempt to isolate parts of\nDescartes’ system that have a bearing on what\n“possible” might mean in his system. Parts of this system\nentail that ‘possible existence’ is just the actual\nexistence of dependent beings. If by “possible existence”\nDescartes just means the dependent existence of actually existing\ncreatures, then passages in which Descartes speaks of a thing as being\npossible or having possible existence are not evidence that Descartes\nholds that there are things that could be but are not. Of course, it\nmight just be the case that Descartes has reason to help himself to\nentities that the rest of his system shuts out. \nIf Descartes does hold that there are things that could be but are\nnot, his view still demands the important qualification discussed in\nthe first section above. He of course realizes that in everyday\ndiscourse we speak of things that can happen but don’t. However,\nif our understanding of these things is not clear and distinct, and if\nour understanding of them as possible is not clear and distinct, then\nDescartes will not introduce them as possibilities. Descartes\nappreciates that according to common ways of speaking, all kinds of\nthings are possible. As we have seen, he considers this concept of\n‘possible’ after Mersenne introduces it in Second\nObjections: \nHere Descartes might seem to be offering a theory of possibility\naccording to which what it means for something to be possible is just\nfor it to be\n conceivable.[34]\n However, this cannot be Descartes’ view. Descartes holds that\nwhatever we clearly and distinctly perceive is true and that truth is\n“the conformity of thought with its object” (“To\nMersenne, 16 October 1639,” AT 2:597, CSMK 139). If a\npossibility that we are considering is clearly and distinctly\nperceived, then our clear and distinct perception conforms to reality,\nand the possibility that we are conceiving is not merely conceptual.\nInstead, there is also an object to which the clear and distinct\nperception conforms – the sort of thing posited by commentators\nwho argue that Descartes holds that God’s creation consists not\nonly of actuals but of unactualized possibles. Thus, for any\npossibility of which we have a conception, if there is no object to\nwhich that conception conforms – that is, if the possibility\nexists only in thought – the possibility is not clearly\nand distinctly perceived. Possibilities which exist only in\nthought are not part of Descartes’ ontology and so on\nDescartes’ view are not possibilities at all. Descartes’\nremarks to Mersenne actually bear this out. He is indeed considering\nthe view of possibility as conceivability, but in doing so he is\nmerely acknowledging what “everyone commonly means” by\n‘possible’. Descartes sometimes speaks of the possible as\nclearly and distinctly perceived. It is on these passages that any\ninterpretation of Descartes’ views on possibility must be\nbuilt. \nAny interpretation of Descartes’ views on modality needs to be\nsensitive to his view that mind and body are really distinct. The\nconclusion of his Sixth Meditation argument for substance dualism is\nthat “I am really distinct from my body, and can exist without\nit” (AT 7:78, CSM 2:54). A natural reading of Descartes’\nconclusion has him saying that, for any minds and bodies that are\nunited, it is counterfactually possible that they be\n separated.[35]\n His argument would be as follows:  \nSuch a reading is sensitive not only to Descartes’ Sixth\nMeditation comments but also to his further remarks on real\ndistinction in Fourth Replies. There Descartes says that for\n“establishing a real distinction it is sufficient that two\nthings can be understood as ‘complete’ and that each one\ncan be understood apart from the other” (AT 7:221, CSM 2:156). A\nthing is complete, for Descartes, when it is a substance: \nSince a Cartesian substance is a thing that is ontologically\nindependent (Principles I.51–52), a complete thing is\nan ontologically independent thing. When we clearly and distinctly\nperceive mind and body to be complete, we know that they are\nsubstances. When we still clearly and distinctly perceive them to be\nsubstances after clearly and distinctly perceiving them apart from\neach other, we know that they are not the same substance under\ndifferent descriptions. On this view, Descartes holds that mind and\nbody are ontologically independent substances, and their distinctness\nconsists in their ability to continue to exist even after God\nseparates\n them.[36] \nAn alternative interpretation of Descartes on the real distinction\nbetween mind and body reads the distinction as consisting in the\nontological independence of mind and body, but not in their\n separability.[37]\n Descartes holds that a sufficient condition for establishing a real\ndistinction between two things is clearly and distinctly perceiving\nthem to be non-identical substances (“Synopsis of these\nfollowing six Meditations,” AT 7:13, CSM 2:9; Fourth\nReplies, AT 7:221–223, CSM 2:156–58). If so, he holds\nthat the substantiality of two non-identical substances does not\nconsist in their being separable, even though in fact they are\n separable.[38]\n On this view, mind and body are separable for Descartes; it’s\njust that their separability is a consequence of the (different) fact\nthat they are really\n distinct.[39] \nA third reading of the Cartesian real distinction stresses the\ndifficulty in making room for unactualized possibilities in\nDescartes’ system. The reading also highlights that Descartes\nholds that our clear and distinct perceptions are veridical but says\n(in his proof of real distinction) that God can bring about\nwhatever we clearly and distinctly perceive. Descartes is clear in\nother texts that the reason why he mentions God’s power in the\nproof of real distinction is to remind us that no matter how unlikely\nwe think it is that our intimately united minds and bodies could also\nbe really distinct, God has enough power to have made all of\nour clear and distinct perceptions veridical: \nIn Fourth Replies Descartes say that his reason for\nmentioning God’s power in the Sixth Meditation proof of real\ndistinction is to remind his reader that our clear and distinct\nperceptions are veridical (AT 7:226, CSM 2:159). In the Sixth\nMeditation itself he arrives at a clear and distinct perception of\nmind as an immaterial substance and body as a material non-thinking\nsubstance and is immediately struck by the union of his mind and body:\n“It is true that I may have… a body that is very closely\njoined to me” (AT 7:78, CSM 2:54). He says that\n“nevertheless” his mind and body are really distinct.\nDescartes appreciates that the facts of mind-body union and mind-body\nseparation are\n opposed.[41]\n In the context of demonstrating the real distinction between mind and\nbody he reminds us that God’s power is such that there can be\ncreatures that have nothing in common but that are intimately\n united.[42] \nIf we take seriously the consideration that there is no room in\nDescartes’ ontology for unactualized possibilities, the real\ndistinction between mind and body does not amount to their\ncounterfactual\n separation.[43]\n God has willed the series of creatures from eternity, and the claim\nthat mind and body can exist apart might amount to the claim that when\na given mind and body are separated in the series, each is\nontologically independent and so continues to\n exist.[44]\n That is, instead of reflecting that there is anything more in\nDescartes’ ontology than what is contained in the series that\nGod wills and preordains, the claim that mind and body can exist apart\nmight amount to Descartes’ note in “Synopsis of these\nfollowing six Meditations” that in the Sixth Meditation he is\nattempting to re-assure us that “the decay of the body does not\nimply the destruction of them mind” (AT 7:13, CSM 1:10). \nIf Descartes holds that potential being is strictly speaking nothing,\nand if his ontology and his commitment to divine immutability, divine\npreordination, and (his particular conception of) omnipotence bar\npossibilities from his system, it is not exactly clear what to make of\nthe possibility of mind and body existing in separation. One view is\nthat Descartes is committed to the reality of this possibility and\nthat, with his commitment to other possibilities, this commitment is\npart of a pattern of Descartes’ helping himself to entities that\nhis system does not allow. That is, it might be the case that\nDescartes wants his system to be rich enough to posit possibilities\nand that, when it isn’t, he posits them anyway. Or, it might be\nthe case that because the Meditations does not attempt to\nanalyze (and then refine) the meditator’s\npre-Meditations view of modality, the ‘can’ in\nDescartes’ claim that mind and body can exist apart is the not\nfully analyzed ‘can’ of the\n vernacular.[45] \nThe whole project of the Fourth Meditation would appear to suggest\nthat Descartes is committed to the view that human beings can do\nsomething other than what God preordains. The Fourth Meditation tells\nus that error is avoidable, that we err not as as a result of the way\nthat we are constructed but as a result of our mis-use of one of the\nfaculties that God has provided us, and that to avoid error we must\nrefrain from affirming what we do not perceive clearly and\ndistinctly. \nBut there are passages in Descartes’ corpus that make a surface\nreading of the Fourth Meditation problematic. One is of course the\nPrinciples I.40–41 text in which Descartes says that\nGod pre-ordains everything from eternity. He does admit that “we\ncan easily get ourselves into great difficulties if we attempt to\nreconcile this divine preordination with the freedom of our will, or\nattempt to grasp both these things at once” (AT 8A:20, CSM\n1:206). But this just means that he himself appreciates the\nproblem. \nThere are other difficult texts as well: \nIn the Principles I.40–41 discussion, Descartes appeals\nto divine incomprehensibility to make sense of how human freedom and\ndivine preordination are to be reconciled. God is infinitely powerful,\nand He somehow made a universe in which it is true both that human\nbeings are free and that God has preordained everything from eternity\n(AT 8A:20, CSM 1:206). Perhaps we should just assume that Descartes\nthinks that human freedom is inconsistent with divine pre-ordination\nand that we cannot make sense of human freedom (except by appeal to\ndivine incomprehensibility). \nAnother interpretive option is to emphasize that in\nPrinciples 1.40–41 Descartes is saying only that our\nexperience of freedom and independence is in tension with divine\npre-ordination (Cunning 2010, 138–42). There is a way in which\nour experience of freedom is perfectly consistent with divine\npre-ordination, of course, if God has immutably decreed all of our\nmental life for all eternity and if our mental life includes some\nexperiences and not others. But it might seem puzzling why we have an\nexperience of freedom at all. Still, if Descartes allows that human\nfreedom itself is consistent with divine pre-ordination, then he is\nnot a libertarian but a compatibilist.  \nPassages outside of the Meditations might be easily read as\nconsistent with the view that for Descartes there does not exist any\nunactualized possible reality, but the view appears not to square with\nmany of the claims of the Fourth Meditation. The Meditation does\ncontain compatibilist-sounding claims – for example, that the\nwill is maximally free when it is compelled to affirm truth (AT 7:58,\nCSM 2:40); that it would be impossible for us to be in a state of\nindifference if we had distinct perceptions only (ibid.); and\nthat assent and dissent are a matter of the will being pulled and\ncompelled by reasons (AT 7:59; CSM 2:41). However, the whole point of\nthe Fourth Meditation would seem to be that God is imperfect if our\nerrors (and false affirmations) are inevitable, and thus that on any\ngiven occasion it is always possible for us to affirm or deny. In a\nrecent book, C.P. Ragland reasons along these lines – he argues\nthat the Fourth Meditation supposes a view of freedom according to\nwhich a finite mind has a two-way libertarian power to affirm or not\naffirm in cases where its perception is not clear and distinct.\nOtherwise, it is not clear what the sense is in which finite minds\nwould have the power to avoid error, or what the sense is in which\nerror would be on us and not on God (Ragland 2016,77–81, 234).\nRagland points to a number of other passages in defense of his\nlibertarian interpretation. One is Principles I.37, in which\nDescartes says that  \nThis passage as quoted is strongly suggestive of the libertarian\nreading, especially the bit at the end, but there is actually an issue\nof translation that needs to be addressed. A more literal translation\nof the last clause – “… quam si non possemus non amplecti”\n– is “… than if we were not able to not embrace it.” This\nlatter language is in fact similar to the language in the Fourth\nMeditation, where Descartes sounds quite compatibilist. He says in the\nFourth Meditation that “the will consists simply in our ability to do\nor not do something” (CSM 2:40), but he also says in the same breath\nthat our will is free in cases where it is irresistibly compelled to\naffirm a clearly and distinctly perceived truth. The will does not\npossess a two-way power in such instances, but it still consists in an\nability to do or not do. That is to say, the will has in its arsenal a\ncapacity to affirm and a capacity to deny, but not a two-way\ncontra-causal power. Ragland would presumably respond to the\ntranslational concerns about Principles I.37 by saying that\nthere is a larger and more pressing philosophical concern: that\nDescartes holds that volitions are praiseworthy, but volitions cannot\nbe said to be praiseworthy if they could not be otherwise (Ragland,\n61–62, 77–78). However, we might present the same concern\nback to the libertarian: if a volition is a modification of a mental\nsubstance, and it materializes in that substance without a prior\nmodification as its cause, volitions would seem to pop into existence\nfrom nowhere, and the will instead would be a loose cannon. Perhaps\nRagland might respond here by introducing the notion of agent\ncausation and saying that, for Descartes, a mental substance itself is\nable to generate a volition, and not as a result of the activity of\nany of its modes. However, there are tremendous difficulties in trying\nto make sense of how agent causation would work in a substance-mode\nontology. If we imagined a substance with no modes whatsoever –\nin line with the thought experiment that Spinoza presents in Short\nTreatise on God, Man, and His Well-Being (84) – it is\ndifficult to make any sense at all of the process by which a volition\nwould form in that substance. If the substance has no modes, but then\nit all of a sudden had a volition, there would be no reason why it\nformed that particular volition rather than some other, and there\nwould be no reason why it formed the volition at that particular\nmoment and not at a different moment. If we do start positing reasons,\nin terms of some specific underlying mental activity that was brewing\nbeforehand and was a precursor to the volition, we could then think\nabout the case of two identical substances that both have that same\nunderlying activity and a lot more activity besides. If both\nsubstances are identical and have all of the same modes, we could ask\nif a volition could occur in one that did not occur in the other. But\nthe same set of concerns would seem to arise. There would be no reason\nfor the volition to appear, in which case it would again be random,\nand the notion of accountability for volitions would make little\nsense. \nA compatibilist reading of the Fourth Meditation resolution of the\nproblem of error would have to emphasize the following: that the\nMeditation provides reasons that push and compel the will to refrain\nfrom affirming perceptions that are not clear and distinct; that the\nMeditation speaks of the will as being pushed and pulled by reasons\nthat are presented to it (CSM 2:40–41); and that Descartes\ninsists that upon further reflection – reflection which occurs\npast the Meditations – it is clear that the entirety of\nour mental lives depends on God’s eternal and immutable will and\nthat, as a result, nothing that happens (including pain and death, and\npresumably error) is bad; and that something (like error) can be the\noutcome of God’s will if we just understand it in its full\ncontext. In the Sixth Meditation, Descartes offers a similar theodicy\nto explain the occurrence of misleading sensations – for\nexample, the feeling of a pain in a part of the body that has been\namputated. Descartes argues there that if we are going to have a body,\nthings like that will sometimes happen; they are just part of the\nterritory for a mind that is embodied, and for reasons that are not\nentirely clear to us, it is better to be embodied than not (CSM\n2:57–61). The Fourth Meditation theodicy might be exactly\nparallel. If we had just a will or just an intellect, we would never\nerr, but there are advantages to having both. When the two are brought\ntogether, however, the intellect sometimes pushes and pulls the will\nto affirm or deny. A finite intellect has limited information, and\nsome of the affirmations that it compels the will to make will not\nconform exactly to reality, but it is better that we have both than\nthat we have just one. Furthermore, we can trust that “insofar as\nthese acts depend on God, they are wholly true and good” (CSM 2:42),\nand so perhaps there is a perspective from which even our erroneous\naffirmation are getting at truth, in an incomplete manner, or just\nconfusedly. \nA final problem for the view that Descartes subscribes to a\nlibertarian conception of freedom is that in the end it is required to\nappeal to a doctrine of divine incomprehensibility to explain how\ndivine providence and foreknowledge are consistent with libertarian\nfreedom. Ragland does this (Ragland 2016, 230–235), as does Wee\n(in Wee 2014, 199–200). We do not need to force Descartes to\nappeal to divine incomprehensibility if we interpret him as a\ncompatibilist, and as we have seen we could save him from additional\ntrouble as well. He does appeal to divine incomprehensibility in the\ncourse of trying to understand why we would have an\nexperience of independence if God has preordained everything\nfrom eternity, and that experience is mysterious indeed, but Descartes\ndoes not say anywhere that freedom itself is inconsistent with divine\npreordination. As we have seen, however, in one passage he speaks of\nthe \nA final issue to consider in the context of discussing\nDescartes’ view on human freedom is the issue of the extent to\nwhich finite minds are compelled or drawn to affirm clear and distinct\nperceptions. There are a number of texts in which Descartes reflects\nthat view that finite minds are wholly unable to refrain from\naffirming a clear and distinct\n perception.[46]\n Indeed, we might think that the only way that we would be able to\nknow that God’s non-deceiverhood secures the truth of clear and\ndistinct perceptions is if those perceptions are utterly compelled.\nThere are passages, however, in which Descartes appears to reflect the\nview that it is within the power of the will to refrain from affirming\na clear and distinct perception. One is Principles I.37, in\nwhich Descartes says that “when we embrace the truth, our doing\nso voluntarily is much more to our credit than would be the case if we\ncould not do otherwise” (AT 8A:19, CSM 1:205). But this passage\nis especially odd given that only a few lines later in\nPrinciples I.43 Descartes offers one of his statements of the\nview that we are unable to doubt clear and distinct perceptions (in\nwhich we are embracing the\n truth…).[47] \nAnother passage in which Descartes appears to reflect the view that it\nis within the power of a finite will to refrain from affirming a clear\nand distinct perception is in “To [Mesland], 9 February\n1645.” There Descartes writes that \nAn examination of the larger context of this passage in the shows that\nit is not in fact evidence that Descartes holds that it is within the\npower of a finite will to refrain from affirming a clear and distinct\nperception. In the previous letter to Mesland Descartes had said\nthat \nDescartes’ view that clear and distinct perceptions are\nwill-compelling is the view that so long as the intellect has a clear\nand distinct idea, it is impossible for the will to refrain from\naffirming it. What it is for a finite mind to clearly and distinctly\nperceive X is for its intellect to have a clear and distinct\nidea of X and for its will to affirm X, but while the intellect\nis presenting this clear and distinct idea, the will cannot stop\naffirming it to turn its attention to something else. Instead, another\nidea must be put in place of the clear and distinct idea, and by\nsomething other than the\n will.[48]\n As Descartes says by way of qualification in the February 1645\nletter, we suspend judgment when something else distracts the will\nfrom a clear and distinct idea (AT 4:173, CSMK 245) – for\nexample the desire to exhibit our\n freedom.[49] \nIt is tempting to assume that Descartes accepts the Spinozistic view\nthat the will is at the mercy of the clarity with which the intellect\nhas ideas. (Of course, in Spinoza’s language the view is that\nthere is no distinction between will and intellect and that to the\nextent that we understand something our will is drawn to affirm it.)\nDescartes appears to accept this view in the case of clear and\ndistinct ideas at least, and it would make sense for him to think that\nthe compellingness of truth and goodness does not disappear when our\ngrasp of it is slightly weakened. But such a reading is speculative at\nbest. \nIt is presumably an adequacy condition on the interpretation of the\nwork of any systematic philosopher that the work be interpreted in\nlight of the central tenets of that philosopher’s system. The\ninterpretive problem of course is that for almost any such philosopher\nthere are controversies about what these central tenets are. It is\nuncontroversial that Descartes sometimes speaks of possibility and\nnecessity. What is not so uncontroversial is what he is talking about\nwhen he talks about these. In particular, if Descartes is committed to\nthe view that there is unactualized possible being, then either (1)\nthe alleged parts of his system that seem to disallow such being are\nnot parts of his system, (2) the parts of his system that seem to\ndisallow such being do not really disallow it, or (3) he is not a\nwholly systematic philosopher. There is no chance that (3) is right,\nbut much work remains to be done in debates over (1) and (2).","contact.mail":"david-cunning@uiowa.edu","contact.domain":"uiowa.edu"}]
