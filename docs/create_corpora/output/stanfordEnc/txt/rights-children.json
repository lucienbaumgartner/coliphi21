Some children are very young human\nbeings. As human beings children evidently have a certain moral\nstatus. There are things that should not be done to them for the\nsimple reason that they are human. At the same time children are\ndifferent from adult human beings and it seems reasonable to think\nthat there are things children may not do that adults are permitted to\ndo. In the majority of jurisdictions, for instance, children are not\nallowed to vote, to marry, to buy alcohol, to have sex, or to engage\nin paid employment. Equally there are things that arguably should not\nbe done to children because they are children, such as conscription\ninto military service. What makes children a special case for\nphilosophical consideration is this combination of their humanity and\ntheir youth, or, more exactly, what is thought to be associated with\ntheir youth. One very obvious way in which the question of what\nchildren are entitled to do or to be or to have is raised is by\nasking, Do children have rights? If so, do they have all the rights\nthat adults have and do they have rights that adults do not have? If\nthey do not have rights how do we ensure that they are treated in the\nmorally right way? Most jurisdictions accord children legal rights.\nMost countries—though not the United States of\nAmerica—have ratified the United Nations Convention on the\nRights of the Child which was first adopted in 1989. The Convention\naccords to children a wide range of rights including, most centrally,\nthe right to have their ‘best interests’ be ‘a\nprimary consideration’ in all actions concerning them (Article\n3), the ‘inherent right to life’ (Article 6), and the\nright of a child “who is capable of forming his or her own views\n… to express these views freely in all matters affecting the\nchild” (Article 12) (United Nations 1989). However it is normal\nto distinguish between ‘positive’ rights, those that are\nrecognised in law, and ‘moral’ rights, those that are\nrecognised by some moral theory. That children have\n‘positive’ rights does not then settle the question of\nwhether they do or should have moral rights. However there are at\nleast good political reasons why one might think that the UNCRC\nprovides an exemplary statement—in the language of positive\nrights—of how children should be treated and regarded.\nNevertheless the idea of children as rights holders has been subject\nto different kinds of philosophical criticism At the same time there\nhas been philosophical consideration of what kinds of rights children\nhave if they do have any rights at all. The various debates shed light\non both the nature and value of rights, and on the moral status of\nchildren. \n\n\nThese matters, to be considered below, need also to be seen as closely\ntied to at least two other philosophical questions: what is childhood?\n(See the entry on\n childhood.)\n And, how do the putative rights of children stand in relation to the\nrights of those adults who, arguably, have rights over children? The\nfirst question is considered at length in Part I of Archard (2015).\nThe second question broaches the issues of parental rights and\nresponsibilities. (See the entry on\n procreation and parenthood.)\n \nArticle 1 of the United Nations Convention defines a child as any\nhuman being below the age of eighteen years ‘unless,’ it\nadds, ‘under the law applicable to the child, majority is\nattained earlier’ (United Nations 1989). In what follows this\ndefinition will be assumed. Some think it obvious that children do\nhave rights and believe that the only interesting question is whether\nchildren possess all and only those rights which adults possess.\nOthers are sceptical believing that given the nature both of rights\nand of children it is wrong to think of children as right-holders.\n \nOne background worry against which such scepticism may be set is an\noft-expressed concern at the proliferation of rights by either\nextending the list of right-holders or expressing more demands as\nrights claims. The concern is that the prodigality of rights\nattributions devalues them rights. A favoured metaphor in this context\nis monetary: the inflation of rights talk devalues the currency of\nrights (Sumner 1987, 15; Steiner 1998, 233).  \nThis thought must trouble the defenders of children’s rights\nsince, after all, talk of children having rights has post-dated the\nintroduction and general acceptance of rights talk as such. There are,\nhowever, more particular reasons for being suspicious of the idea that\nchildren have rights. To appreciate these it is necessary to be\nclearer about the language of rights. With respect to rights in\ngeneral we can inquire as to what it is for someone to have a right,\nor, put another way, we can ask what being a right-holder consists in.\nThere are here two competing accounts, one of which is seen as fatal\nto the idea of children as right-holders. We can ask a different\nquestion, namely what must be true for there to be rights. That is, we\ncan try to specify what have been called the ‘existence\nconditions for rights’ (Sumner 1987, 10–11). We can also\nconstruct a taxonomy of the different kinds of rights. Finally we can\nask what the moral significance of having a right is, or what weight\nrights have. With regard to any acknowledged right we can identify it\nby means of its content (what is it a right to?) and its scope (who\nhas it and against whom do they have it?), as well as its weight\nrelative to other rights and to other moral considerations. Not all of\nthese questions are relevant when we want to focus on the particular\nissue of whether or not children have rights, and, if so, which ones.\nHowever the first question raised above is especially salient. \nWhat is it for someone to have a right? Here there are two competing\ntheories whose respective virtues and vices have been extensively\ndebated. In one camp is the will or choice theory (Hart 1973; Sumner\n1987; Steiner 1994); inthe opposing camp is the welfare or interest\ntheory (MacCormick 1982; Raz 1984; Kramer 1998). The first theory sees\na right as the protected exercise of choice. In particular to have a\nright is to have the power to enforce or waive the duty of which the\nright is the correlative. The second theory sees a right as the\nprotection of an interest of sufficient importance to impose on others\ncertain duties whose discharge allows the right-holder to enjoy the\ninterest in question. It is natural to think that each theory is more\nappropriate for certain kinds of rights. The will theory fits rights\nactively to do things (to speak, to associate with others) whereas the\ninterest theory fits rights passively to enjoy or not to suffer things\n(to receive health care, not to be tortured). However the distinction\nbetween the theories of what it is to have a right is not the\ndistinction between different kinds of rights, even if there are\nimportant relations between the two distinctions. \nIn this present context one alleged defect of the will theory\nis——its exclusion of some humans from the category of\nright-holders. This is because whilst all humans, and perhaps many\nclasses of non-humans such as animals, have interests that ought to be\nprotected, not all humans have the capacity to exercise choice.\nChildren—along with the severely mentally disabled and the\ncomatose—cannot thus, on the will theory, be the holders of\nrights. For at least one prominent defender of the interest theory the\nfact that children evidently do have rights is sufficient to display\nthe falsity of the will theory, thus making children a\n‘test-case’ for the latter (MacCormick 1982). Of course\nsomeone who is convinced of the correctness of the will theory might\nreadily concede that the theory entails the denial of rights to\nchildren but see no reason to abandon the theory. For her the\nentailment is not, ‘Children have rights. Therefore, the will\ntheory is false’. It is, ‘The will theory is true.\nTherefore, children cannot have rights’. \nThe claims in question can be set out as follows. These are not\npremises in a single argument. Rather they are claims made and\nconclusions drawn by the different theories of rights. In particular\nclaims 1–4 are made by the will theory, and claims 5–7 by\nthe interest theory.: \nTo explain (6). An important claim held by many is that for each and\nevery right there is a correlative duty. To say that I have a right to\nsomething is to say that someone else has a duty to me in respect of\nthat thing. This of course does not mean that there may not be some\nkinds of duties which do not correlate withany rights. Indeed some\ncritics of children’s rights will concede that adults have\nduties to protect important interests of children but deny that these\ninterests correlate with rights held by children. Now clearly (4) and\n(7) contradict one another: either children are right-holders or they\nare not. (4) follows from (2) and (3). (2) expresses the will theory.\n(3) is obviously a contestable, and contested, claim. But insofar as\nchildren cannot exercise choice and are required to do so on the will\ntheory if they are to have rights, then it follows that they cannot\nhave rights. (7), on the other hand, follows from (5) and (6) which\ngive expression to the interest theory, although they do so only\ninsofar as the duties adults have in respect of children are such that\nthey do correlate with rights held by children. If they do then as\nthings stand either the will theory is true and children do not have\nrights, or the interest theory is true and they do. Or, put another\nway, either children have rights in which case the will theory cannot\nbe true, or they do not in which case that theory could be true. \nA will theorist who did not want to deny that children have rights\nmight deny (2). He might say that although it is true that children\nare themselves incapable of exercising choice it does not follow that\nthey cannot still be possessors of rights. For children might have\nrepresentatives, such as most obviously their parents or guardians,\nwho could exercise the choices on behalf of the children. The\nrepresentatives would choose for the children as the children would\nchoose if they were capable of choosing for themselves. This proxy\nexercise of choice would take place only during the period when the\nchildren were incapable of exercising choice and in acknowledgment of\nthe fact that the children will eventually be capable of exercising\ntheir own choices. The will theory’s most prominent defender\n(Hart 1973, 184 n.86) makes just such a modification of the will\ntheory in respect of children. \nNow such a modification must meet a number of challenges. First, how\nshould the representatives be selected? Should those empowered to act\nas representatives be those who are most likely to choose as the\nchildren would choose if capable, or are there are other independent\ngrounds on which they are selected—such, as most obviously, that\nthey are the child’s parents? Think of the representation of\nchildren as like a trust. The children entrust their decision-making\nto their representatives who are thus their trustees. Now, second, are\nthe terms of the trust sufficiently clear and determinate? Is it, for\ninstance, perspicuous and evident what a child would choose if capable\nof choosing? Note that the criterion is not what is in the best\ninterests of the child for, consistent with the will theory, we must\nappeal to choices rather than interests. It is not easy to say what\nsome adult who cannot currently choose—because she is, for\ninstance, temporarily comatose—would choose if able. It is even\nharder in the case of someone, a child, who is for the period of\nchildhood simply incapable of making any choices. Third, how is the\ntrust to be enforced and by whom? The representative may be presumed\nto have a duty to choose as the child would choose if able. If rights\nare correlative with duties then someone other than the representative\nand the child must be in a position to enforce or waive this duty.\nCould this be the state or its representative? \nIf the will theory can meet these formidable challenges it can accord\nrights to children who are not then a straightforward\n‘test-case’ for determining which theory of rights is\ncorrect. Moreover, the will theorist can make two further points.\nFirst she might accept (6)—that rights and duties are\ncorrelative— but deny or at least significantly modify\n(5)—that adults have duties to protect the important interests\nof children. She could say that the duties that are rightly specified\nunder (5) are not the duties that correlate with rights. This is just\nto say, as all rights theorists will repeatedly say, that rights do\nnot exhaust the moral domain. What we must do because others have\nrights against us is not everything we must morally do. (6) asserts\nthat for each and every right there is a correlate duty. It is not the\nclaim that for each and every duty there is a correlate right. So we\nshould, as adults, ensure that the interests of children are protected\nand promoted. It does not follow that they have rights against us. \nSecond a will theorist might accept (5) and (6) as they stand but say\nthat the rights which correlate with these duties are possessed not by\nthe children but by adults who are in the best position to protect the\nchildren. Thus even if the duties adults have in respect of children\ndo correlate with rights it does not follow that the rights in\nquestion are held by those whose interests they protect. Indeed it\nmight be argued that it does not matter whether the rights are\npossessed by those whose interests they protect. Does it really\nmatters whether the rights that correlate with adult duties to\nchildren are held by the children or by those who would act as best\nthey could for the children? (Steiner 1998, 261). \nThis review of the will and interest theory has simply examined the\nissue of whether the denial of children’s rights can be thought\nof as a test case for the probity of the will theory. There may of\ncourse be other considerations that tell against the will theory and\nin favour of the interest theory; or the converse. \nGrant that on either account of what it is to have a right children\ncould, in principle, be the holders of rights. Ought children to have\nrights? And, if so, what rights should they have? Note that the rights\ncan be moral or legal. Children do have rights in law (under the UN\nConvention most notably). These need not be accepted as moral rights.\nHowever someone could believe that the best way, on balance, to\nprotect the interests of children is by continuing to accord them the\nlegal rights they have under something like the Convention. Someone\nmight also believe that children should have legal rights but not\nthose they are currently accorded. Conversely, if children do have\nmoral rights, these need not be enshrined in law, although there would\nevidently be a strong presumption that they should. In the first\ninstance the question is whether children should have moral rights. If\nthey should then there would be a good case for thinking that these\nshould be legally protected rights.  \nThose who claim that children should have all the rights that adults\npresently have are called ‘liberationists’ to be discussed\nin the next section and include Holt, Farson and Cohen (Farson 1974;\nHolt 1975; Cohen 1980). We can distinguish real from rhetorical\nliberationists. The latter are those who see the demand for equal\nrights for children as a means both of drawing attention to the\ndiscrimination that children suffer by comparison with adults in their\ntreatment and for improving their condition. A rhetorical\nliberationist does not actually believe that children should be the\nequals of adults. Rather he thinks that claiming as much is the best\nway of advancing their interests. A real liberationist does view\nchildren as the equals of adults. Then there are those who think that\nchildren should have some but not all of the rights which adults have.\nFinally there are those who think that children should not have any\nrights. Or, put less brusquely, they are sceptical, for theoretical\nand political reasons, about attributing rights to children. Their\ncase is made in three ways. The first is to assert what liberationists\ndeny, namely that children are not qualified as adults are to have\nrights. The second is to argue that the ascription of rights to\nchildren is inappropriate because it displays a misunderstanding of\nwhat childhood is, what children are like, or what relationships\nchildren stand in to adults. The third is to argue that,\nnotwithstanding their lack of rights, children can be assured of\nadequate moral protection by other means. \nLet me take the first claim first. The question of qualification is\nthe question of whether children have the requisite capacity for\nrights. On the will theory of rights the relevant capacity qualifying\nchildren for possession of rights is that of the ability to choose.\nBut there is a more general issue of capacity that is in dispute\nwhatever theory of rights is defended and that follows from attention\nto the fact that rights have a content. Each right is a right to do,\nto be or to have something. Arguably only those rights can be\npossessed whose content can be appropriately attributed to their\nowners. A right to free speech cannot properly be possessed by an\nentity incapable of speech. One conventional way to think of rights in\nterms of their content is to distinguish between freedom rights\n(rights to choose, such as to vote, practise a religion, and to\nassociate) and welfare rights (rights that protect important interests\nsuch as health). \nChildren in general lack certain cognitive abilities—to acquire\nand to process information in an ordered fashion, to form consistent\nand stable beliefs, to appreciate the significance of options and\ntheir consequences. They also lack certain volitional\nabilities—to form, retain and act in the light of consistent\ndesires, to make independent choices. Children are not unique amongst\nhumans in this respect. Those adults who are seriously mentally\nimpaired are also disqualified in this sense. Which is of course just\nto say that these adults are childlike. Children are unique in the\nfollowing regard. Not all humans are seriously mentally impaired, but\nall humans were once children. Thus every one of us was, during our\nearly years, not qualified to be a holder of rights even if now we are\nso qualified. \nIt is worth distinguishing – as Schapiro (1999, 2003) does\n– between two ways in which a child is, relative to an adult,\nincapable. Schapiro argues that childhood is a ‘normative\npredicament’ wherein the child is in a state of nature, lacking\nany independent will whereby she might authoritatively and in her own\nvoice order her desires. She is an ‘instinctual wanton’.\nOn her account the capacities a child lacks are not those of making\ngood choices, but those of making any choices as such. \nA child’s incapacity, in the senses indicated above, would seem\nto disqualify them from having liberty rights. Someone incapable of\nchoosing cannot have a right whose content is a fundamental choice.\nIf, as some maintain, all human rights are best interpreted as\nprotecting human agency and its preconditions, then it would follow\nthat those incapable of agency, such as young children, should not be\naccorded human rights (Griffin 2002). On the other hand it could be\nmaintained that whilst children lack agency they certainly have\nfundamental interests meriting protection and thus at least have\nwelfare rights (Brighouse 2002). Moreover it can be important to\nrecognise that children become beings capable of making choices and\nthat rights may be attributed in recognition of this gradual\ndevelopment (Brennan 2002). \nThe second claim that may be made in denying rights to children is\nthat the ascription of rights to children is inappropriate because it\ndisplays a misunderstanding of what childhood is, of what children are\nlike, or of what relationships children do or ought to stand in to\nadults. This claim comes in various forms. \nOn one view we should start our thinking about what morally we owe to\nchildren by specifying our obligations as adults to them\n(O’Neill 1988). There certainly exist what are called perfect\nobligations. These are obligations that are either owed to all\nchildren or to some specified set of children. They are perfect in\nthat it is completely specified whom they are owed to and what is owed\nto them. We all are obliged not to maltreat any child and parents have\na particular duty to care for their children. But then there are\nimperfect obligations which are those of caring for children to whom\nwe do not, as parents for instance, have specific obligations. All\nadults owe these but they are not owed to all children (how could they\npossibly be?) nor is it specified what precisely is owed to them (this\nwill depend on circumstances). \nPerhaps then we can agree that we are all under a duty to prevent the\nabuse of children. But clearly we cannot, as individuals, each act to\nstop every child being abused. Moreover what we ought to do—for\ninstance, by reporting suspected cases of abuse—will depend on\nthe circumstances, and also on what is in place by way of particular\ninstitutions and laws to deal with child abuse. \nCrucially whilst perfect obligations correlate with rights, imperfect\nobligations do not. This means that anyone who starts and finishes\nthinking about what morally is owed to children in terms of their\nrights is unable to capture what imperfect obligations express. Yet\nthis is to miss much of what is most important about the way in which,\nmorally, we should as adults stand in relation to children. For the\nfulfilment of these imperfect duties of care and concern is what\ncentrally protects and promotes the lives of children as children.\nThinking ethically about children’s lives in terms of their\nputative rights is to misperceive what is of central importance and\nvalue in these lives. \nOne possible response to O’Neill’s argument is as follows\n(Coady 1992). She does not deny that perfect obligations correlate\nwith rights. Thus to the extent that we do have perfect obligations to\nchildren they do have corresponding rights. Yet O’Neill denies\nthat imperfect obligations correlate with rights. But why should we\nthink that? The imperfect obligations are fundamental ones. They are\nnot supererogatory, that is beyond duty. Adults must show\nconsideration and kindness to children in general. So why cannot\nchildren claim such kindness and consideration from adults as their\nright? O’Neill does say that when imperfect obligations are\ninstitutionalised—when, for instance there are laws and\ninstitutions specifying who should act and how to detect and prevent\nchild abuse—there are created positive special obligations to\nwhich correspond positive rights. But she adds that the obligations\nof, say, the social worker exceed the positive obligations associated\nwith her job. However this is true of all our obligations, whether\nperfect or imperfect. A parent can have positive, that is legally\nrecognised and sanctioned, duties to her child. Yet her perfect\nobligations to her children are not exhaustively specified by what the\nlaw requires of her. \nO’Neill’s argument does not rely on any specification of\nthe content of the obligations that might be owed by adults to\nchildren. Rather it is about the structure of our moral reasoning in\nrespect of children, and the priority—false in the\nargument’s view—that is given to rights. As an argument it\nthus bears some comparison with a view that expresses general\nscepticism about rights in the context of adult-child relations and\nwhich emphasises the particular character of the family (Schrag 1980;\nSchoeman 1980). This view draws attention to the quality and nature of\nthe relationships within a family. These are marked by an especial\nintimacy and by deep, unconditional love between its members. One can\ngrant that many families do not conform to this ideal and yet\nacknowledge that when the family does conform to the ideal it is a\ndistinctive, and distinctively valuable, form of human\nassociation. \nWhat arguably follows from this ideal of the family is the\ninappropriateness of asserting or claiming rights. For to do so would\nbe to subvert and ultimately destroy what constitutes the family as\nthe distinctive form of human association it is. Appeal is being made\nhere to a familiar and oft-drawn distinction between two ways in which\nindividuals engaged in a common enterprise or bound together in some\nenduring association can be assured of their beneficent, or at least\nminimally good, treatment of one another. One way is by the\nrecognition—in law or custom or shared morality—of rights\nthat all individuals can claim, or by rules of justice—similarly\nand generally recognised—which provide an assurance of fair\ntreatment. Another way is by reliance on the dispositions or attitudes\nthat the individuals bound together have—spontaneously and\nnaturally—towards one another. Thus, for instance, if each is\nmotivated by general benevolence in respect of all then no one has any\nneed to claim or assert what is due to him as of right or rule. In the\ncase of the family, it is argued, neither justice nor benevolence\nsuffices but love does. Of course children may have rights against\nthose who are not family members (a right, for instance, that their\nschool teachers provide them with information and skills). Some rights\nare held against particular individuals. Others, including the most\nimportant ones, are held against everyone, including parents and other\nfamily members \nA further and quite distinct allegation is that not only is there no\nneed for any such claims, but that allowing them to be made will\nerode, and in due course destroy, the dispositions and attitudes that\nrendered the need for rights and rules of justices unnecessary in the\nfirst place. This further claim is an influential one in the general\ncritique communitarianism makes, within political philosophy, of what\nis characterised as a rights-based and individualistic liberalism\n(see, for instance, Sandel 1982, 32–5). In the context of the\nfamily the claim is that granting its members rights will subvert and\nbring about the end of the love between them that made rights\nsuperfluous in the first place. \nThe arguments considered thus far have appealed to the role that\nrights generally do and should play in our moral lives. A further\nargument considers what would actually follow from granting rights to\nchildren (Purdy 1992). The argument is that we need as adults to have\nacquired certain traits of character if we are to be able to pursue\nour goals and lead a valuable life. To acquire these traits it is\nessential that we not be allowed as children to make our own choices.\nGranting children the liberty to exercise rights is destructive of the\npreconditions for the possibility of having fulfilling adult lives.\nThe central, and empirical, premise in this argument is that children\ndo not spontaneously and naturally grow into adults. They need to be\nnurtured, supported, and, more particularly, subjected to control and\ndiscipline. Without that context giving children the rights that\nadults have is bad for the children. It is also bad for the adults\nthey will turn into, and for the society we share as adults and\nchildren. \nThe defence of the view that children should not, as the liberationist\nasserts, have all the rights that adults have has rested on the claims\nthat, first, children lack the capacities that qualify adults for the\npossession of rights, and, second, that talk of children’s\nrights does not capture the truth about their lives or about the\nfamily or encourages a destructive permissiveness that has poor\nconsequences for adults and their society. The third step in defence\nof the denial of rights to children is to provide reassurance that\nsuch a denial is not bad for children. \nOne can thus maintain that rights do not exhaust the moral domain.\nThere are things we ought to do which do not correspond to the\nobligations we have as the correlates of rights. As adults we should\nprotect and promote the welfare of children. It need not follow that\nthey have rights against us.  \nBut does not talk of the rights of children nevertheless still serve a\npolitical or rhetorical function by reminding of us of what must be\ndone for them? Might not such talk also serve as a critique of the\nextent to which we, as adults, may maintain children in an artificial\ncondition of dependence and vulnerability, denying them the\nopportunity to make their own choices? Are not children one of the\nlast social groups to be emancipated as others—women,\nblacks—already have been, and is not the language of rights the\nappropriate mode in which to campaign for that emancipation? The reply\n(O’Neill 1988, 459– 463) is that such talk about rights\ntalk misses what is distinctively different about children as a group.\nThis is that childhood is not a permanently maintained status\nassociated with oppression or discrimination. It is rather a stage of\nhuman development which all go through. Moreover the adults who deny\nthat children do have rights may nevertheless also believe that it is\ntheir duty to ensure that the children for whom they have care do pass\nfrom childhood into adulthood. \nThe first claim in the defence of the denial of rights to children is\nthat children are disqualified by virtue of their incapacity to have\nrights. Liberationists dispute this. Liberationists can allow that the\nkey to the appropriateness of giving or not giving rights to children\nturns on capacity (Cohen 1980 ix). They will argue, however, that\nchildren are not disqualified from having rights by virtue of their\nlack of a capacity that adults do have. Note that on this view\nchildren are entitled to both welfare and freedom rights whereas those\nwho concede that children lack the latter in virtue of a certain\nincapacity can still insist that they ought to have welfare rights\nwhere such an incapacity is not relevant. There are two respects in\nwhich this liberationist case might be modified or qualified. The\nfirst is in its scope. The liberationist might claim that all children\nare qualified to have rights, or she might claim only that some\nchildren are so qualified. The latter is the more plausible position\nin view of the fact that the very young infant is evidently\nincapacitated. Indeed some liberationists seem to recognise as much\neven whilst they insist that every child should have rights (Farson\n1974, 31, 172, and 185). If the scope of the liberationist claim is\nthus limited it does not amount to the view that no line dividing\nhuman rights holders from humans who lack rights should be drawn.\nRather it is the view that such a line has been drawn in the wrong\nplace. \nA second possible qualification of the liberationist view is that\ngiving rights to children will play an important part in their\nacquiring the qualifying capacity. It is not thus argued that children\nare capable now and are illegitimately denied their rights. It is\nrather that they will only—or at least will more readily or will\nat an earlier stage—acquire that capacity if given their rights.\nThe denial of rights to children is, on this account, one significant\nelement in a culture that serves artificially to maintain children in\ntheir childlike state of dependence, vulnerability, and immaturity.\nAgain the qualification can concede that children of a very young age\nare not capable enough to have rights, and will not acquire that\ncapacity even if given rights. Yet it insists that the denial of\nrights to children of a certain age on account of their alleged\nincapacity is simply self-confirming. They cannot have rights because\nthey are incapable but they are incapable only because they do not\nhave these rights.  \nOne plausible version of the claim refers to the facts of experience.\nChildren, or at least children of a certain age, may not differ\nmarkedly from adults in respect of their cognitive and volitional\ncapacities. They may be as capable as older humans of making their own\nminds up about what to do and be as independent in their resolution to\nact on their choices. But they may simply not have had as much\nexperience of the world as their adult counterparts. Being thus\nnaïve and inexperienced in the ways of the world they will not be\nas able, that is as qualified, as older (and wiser) humans are to make\nsensible choices. Grant that such a lack of experience can be\nattributed to a lack of opportunities to exercise choice. If such a\nlack of opportunity is in turn attributable not simply to not having\nbeen around for as long but to a denial of the freedom to make their\nown choices, then there is a powerful case for liberty rights being\nextended, even if cautiously, to these young people. \nThere are different ways in which the liberationist claim about\ncapacity—whether qualified or not—can be made. One is by\ndefending a ‘thin’ definition of capacity. For example it\nmay be said that children can make choices if what this means is\nexpressing preferences. Of course the response is that the ability to\nchoose, thus minimallydefined, is indeed possessed by children (even\nfairly young children) but it is not a capacity sufficient to qualify\nfor rights ownership. What is needed for that is more than simply the\nability to express or communicate a desire; what is needed is an\nability to understand and appreciate the significance of the options\nfacing one, together with independence of choice. After all the animal\nwho moves from one feeding bowl to another may be said thereby to\n‘choose’ the food in the latter bowl. But the animal does\nnot have a general capacity of choice sufficient to qualify it as a\nholder of liberty rights. \nLiberationists might move in the other direction and argue that the\ncapacity which qualifies adults to have rights is in fact not a\ncapacity that most, or perhaps any, adults actually possess. Thus it\nwill be said that no adult fully understands the nature of the choices\nshe faces, nor is she consistent in her beliefs and desires, nor is\nshe really independent of the influences of her environment and peers.\nWhether the liberationist urges a ‘thin’ definition of\ncapacity—which the child satisfies as much as the adult—or\nargues that on a ‘thick’ definition of capacity neither\nadult nor child qualifies as capable, the point is the same. This is\nthat the alleged differences between children and adults in respect of\na qualifying capacity are not sufficient to warrant the ascription of\nrights to the latter and their denial to the former. \nOne way then to charge that age is an arbitrary means of\ndistinguishing those qualified and those not qualified to have rights\nis that there is, in fact, no real division of capacities. (Cohen\n1980, 48) However another way to make the charge of arbitrariness in\nturns on the idea that dividing lines as such—‘any’\nlines—are arbitrary. Thus, either it will be said that this age\nis the wrong dividing point or that using any age is wrong. The first\nobjection may concede that there is a better age to be used, just as\nthe second objection may concede that there is a way, better than\nusing age, to mark the division. The initial and obvious reply to the\nsecond objection is that age as such is not the issue but rather the\nreliable correlation of age with the acquisition of those capacities\nthat qualify a person for the attribution of rights. Some\nliberationists may thus not dispute that there should be a threshold\nage—one beyond which adult rights are acquired—but think\nthat the conventional or orthodox threshold is fixed too late.\nLiberationists may also simply deny that there should be any threshold\non the grounds that there just is no difference between children and\nadults in respect of their respective capacities for any threshold age\nto mark. This version of the arbitrariness claim concedes that if age\nfunctions as a threshold it does so only inasmuch as it reliably\ncorrelates with the acquisition of capacities which are necessary\nqualifications for the possession of rights. In sum, the arbitrariness\nclaim amounts either to the denial that the acquisition of the\nspecified capacities does correlate with the threshold in question or\nto the denial that there is any age at which the capacities are\nacquired. \nSetting aside this version of the arbitrariness claim what remains of\nthe charge that ‘[a]ny line which uses age to distinguish people\nwith rights from people without can be shown to be arbitrary’?\nThere are two ideas. The first is that although the threshold of age\ndoes serve to mark a difference within the class of human beings it is\nbeing human as such which is important. Or, relatedly, what is being\ndistributed, namely rights, is so important that all humans should\nhave them. It is being human which should make the difference not\nbeing of a certain age. Rights are too important to be denied to some\nhumans on account of their (lesser) age and given to others on account\nof their (greater) age. \nThe reply is simple. Being human does matter and it is precisely\nbecause they are human beings, albeit young ones, that children are\nentitled to be treated in ways that non-humans may not. not. However\nit is rights that are being distributed and to that end a threshold\nage does mark a significant point. Although having rights is better\nthan not having them, those who lack rights do not lack any moral\nstatus whatever. Children are acknowledged to be humans and yet to be\nyoung humans. \nHowever, it may still be insisted that a threshold age does not mark a\nsignificant enough difference. A 40-year-old differs greatly from a\n4-year-old. Someone who is 18 years and 1 month does not differ\ngreatly from someone who is 17 years and 11 months. It is\nunderstandable that the 40-year-old should have rights whereas the\n4-year-old should not. But this is not the case for the latter\npairing. This is a point about the extent to which real differences\nbetween classes are displayed by the members of each class at the edge\nof these classes. The reply will be that the criticism concedes a\ndifference between being too young to have rights and being old enough\nto have them. These differences are not arbitrary. Moreover a\nthreshold has to be fixed. The fact that there may not be\nsignificant—or significant enough—differences between the\nmembers of the two classes being distinguished at the edges of each\nclass is the price one pays for having to operate with a\nthreshold. \nBut is this price one that has to be paid? The complaint is that age\ndoes not always reliably correlate with competence. Thus using age may\nrisk unfairly penalising some who are in fact competent just as it may\nrisk unfairly rewarding some who are in fact incompetent. Moreover the\npenalties and rewards in question—lacking or possessing\nrights—are far too important to run such risks. Why then should\none not take each individual on her own and determine whether or not\nshe is qualified be have rights? \nThe problems with the suggested use of a test are various. First,\nthere is the sheer administrative scale of its employment in such a\ncase as human rights. Second, there is the problem of agreeing a\ndeterminate procedure for testing. How exactly are we to examine\nsomeone in respect of their competence to possess rights? Third, there\nis the problem of fairness. Any test must not unfairly disqualify some\ngroup of putative rights-holders by, for instance, having a bias in\nthe testing procedure which, in effect, discriminates against that\ngroup. Fourth, the administration of any official test—and\nespecially one whose passing yields such important goods—is\nsubject to the risks of corruption or of misuse for the\nself-interested ends of those administering it. Again this can not be\ntrue of the use of age as a threshold. To summarise, these problems\nattaching to the use of a test are large and insuperable. The charges\nof arbitrariness can be argued to be false or overstated. Children do\ndiffer from adults in respect of their competence to possess rights. A\nthreshold of age may be the appropriate way to register that\ndifference. One should, thus, acquire rights only on reaching a\ncertain age. However, two riders to this summary are appropriate. \nFirst, different rights may be acquired at different ages. After all\nit is plausible to think that the capacities needed for, and\nqualifying a person to possess, different rights are themselves\ndifferent. More particularly, different rights would seem to require\ndifferent degrees of competence. Liberty rights entitle their\npossessors to make choices, and the matters in respect of which\nchoices are made differ in their complexity, importance, and\nconsequential impact. Those who are allowed to choose require greater\nor lesser amounts of maturity, independence, and deliberative\nproficiency in order to be able to make these different kinds of\nchoice. The decisions to marry, consume alcohol, serve in the armed\nforces, undertake paid labour, vote, buy goods in a shop, travel\nunaccompanied, and open a bank account seem to presuppose different\nlevels of understanding and autonomy. Assuming that these levels are\nprogressively acquired at different ages it makes sense to accord the\ncorresponding rights not all at once but in stages. \nSecond, there should be an ordered but consistent acquisition of\nrights. If children are assumed to display the competence required for\none kind of right, they should not be refused another kind of right\nwhich presupposes the same or even a lesser degree of ability. It\nwould not make sense, for instance, to deny a young person the right\nto refuse medical treatment but allow them to choose to die in the\narmed services of their state. \nThe liberationist may make one last move. He may concede that children\ndo lack the capacities that are a prerequisite for the possession of\nrights. However he can suggest that children should be permitted\n‘to borrow the capacities of others to secure whatever it is we\nare entitled to’ (Cohen 1980, 56). Child agents would advise\ntheir clients with a view to ensuring that the child’s right is\nproperly exercised. There are, however, various problems with this\nmove. Most of these exactly parallel those discussed earlier that\nbeset the idea of entrusting the choices of a child to a\nrepresentative. First, who are to be the advisers? These may be\nselected by some fact, such as their biological kinship or their\nsocially recognised role of guardianship, but this fact does not\nensure that they will be the best advisers. A parent is not, by the\nmere fact of parenthood, qualified to give her children the best\nadvice. On the other hand there is unlikely to be any clear fact of\nthe matter as to who is the best adviser or what is the best advice.\nIndeed the various adults who might best advise a child could well\ngive conflicting advice. Second, how is one to determine what should\nguide the advice? Is it what the child would herself choose if\ncompetent to choose or what is in the best interests of the child? The\nproblems with understanding either determination will be discussed in\nSection 7. Third, is the child still free to act or not on the advice\ngiven? If the child is not so free then the role of the adviser is a\nstrictly paternalist one. The ‘adviser’ is simply in a\nposition to supplant the child’s choice as to what is best for\nherself with her own choice as her adviser. If on the other hand the\nchild is free to reject the adviser’s advice then the child is\nfree to do what she wants anyway. This is so even though it has been\nconceded that she is not competent to recognise what is in her best\ninterests. In this case the role of adviser is beside the point. \nOne needs only to ‘borrow’ what one does not have. Not\nusing what could be borrowed leaves one with the lack—and its\nconsequences—that made the borrowing necessary. On the other\nhand if a child can distinguish good from bad advice then the\nborrowing is unnecessary. The child can give as good advice to herself\nas would be given to her by an adviser. But then no adviser is needed\nand this is precisely what Cohen denies. \nIf children can have at least some rights, what rights should they\nhave? One important reason for asking, and for giving a satisfactory\nanswer to, this question is a concern that the child’s moral\nstatus should be adequately secured and protected. Some, like Onora\nO’Neill, believe that this is assured by discharging our\nobligations as adults to children. One can consistent believe both\nthat there are things we ought not to do to children and that children\ndo not have rights. Yet as human beings ought children to have the\nbasic rights that humans have?  \nSince children are humans they are surely entitled to the basic human\nrights. But there are some rights possessed by adults which children\ncannot possess. This is a view defended by Brennan and Noggle (Brennan\nand Noggle 1997). The rights which adults possess are\n‘role-dependent rights’. These are rights associated with\nparticular roles, and possession of the relevant right is dependent on\nan ability to play the role. Thus doctors have rights that their\npatients do not, and car-drivers have rights that those who have not\npassed their driving test do not. This argument is interesting not\nleast because it does not provide, in respect of their rights, a\nfundamental distinction between adults and children. After all some\nadults could conceivably possess no more than the basic rights\npossessed by children since they might have none of the abilities\nrequired to play any of the roles associated with the role-dependent\nrights. \nHowever it is not obvious that children do have the basic human rights\nthat adults have. Central amongst these rights is that of\nself-determination, that is the right to make choices in respect of\none’s own life. This right is the basis of derivative rights to\nmarry, have sex, choose one’s work, purse a course of education,\nand so on. But it is just this right that is normally denied to\nchildren, and it seems that Noggle and Brennan do deny, in effect,\nthat children have this right. If parents can, as Brennan and Noggle\nthink they may, overrule a child’s life-choice it is hard to see\nhow nevertheless the right of choice does not vanish (Brennan and\nNoggle 1997, 16–17). If one adult were to deny that another\nadult could choose as she wished it would be natural to describe this\nas a denial of the second adult’s right of choice. \nTo say that children do not have all the basic human rights that\nadults do is not to deny them their status as humans. After all it\nmakes sense to insist that children have – as humans – a\nbasic right to life. Yet it also makes sense, as suggested, to say\nthat children do not have an adult right of self-determination. It is\ncontroversial to say that children are ‘persons’, since,\nfollowing John Locke, this term denotes those possessed of moral\nagency and capable of being responsible for their actions. Weaker or\nstronger conceptions of ‘personhood’ would lead to the\ninclusion or exclusion of humans at various ages from the category of\nperson. However it is not controversial to state that children are\nhuman, and in saying this to insist that they are entitled to a\ncertain moral regard \nMost who believe that adults have rights which children do not have\nmake the cut between liberty and welfare rights. Feinberg\ndistinguishes between rights that belong only to adults (A-rights),\nrights that are common to both adults and children (A-C-rights), and\nrights that children alone possess (C-rights) (Feinberg 1980). Thus a\ncommon position is that the A-rights include, centrally, the liberty\nrights, and that the A-C-rights include, centrally, the welfare\nrights. To repeat, liberty rights are rights of choice (how and\nwhether to vote, what to say publicly, whether to practise a religion\nand which one, which if any association to join, and so on) whereas\nwelfare rights protect important interests (such as health, bodily\nintegrity, and privacy). \nWhat might be included in the C-rights? Feinberg distinguishes between\ntwo sub-classes of C-rights. There are, first, those rights which\nchildren possess in virtue of their condition of childishness.\nAlthough Feinberg does not further divide this first sub-class of\nC-rights this can be done. There are the rights children have to\nreceive those goods they are incapable of securing for themselves, and\nare incapable of so doing because of their dependence upon adults.\nThese goods might include food and shelter. There are, second, the\nrights to be protected against harms which befall children because of\ntheir childlike vulnerability and whose particular harmfulness is a\nfunction of a fact that they befall children. These harms might\ninclude abuse and neglect. Note that some adults might be argued to\nmerit the same degree of rights-based protection on account of their\nchildlike vulnerability and dependence. Finally, there are goods that\nchildren should arguably receive just because they are children. The\nmost central, and contentious, example is a child’s right to be\nloved. This is not an A-C-right but it is arguably a C-right, and\nindeed is cited by many as a C-right (MacCormick 1976, 305). Various\ndeclarations of children’s rights include such a right and a\nrespectable case can be made to meet the various objections normally\nraised against its attribution (Liao 2015). \nMost of these C-rights can be termed ‘protection’ rights\nsince, they seek to provide protection for children. Further they do\nso because the state or condition of childhood calls forth and\nrequires this protection. We should be careful to distinguish\nprotection from provision or welfare rights. Children, along with\nadults, have welfare rights but the content of these will differ\nbetween children and adults. It will do so because of the particular\nform that children’s needs and circumstances take. Thus grant\nthat both children and adults have a welfare right to health care. In\nthe case of children but not that of adults paediatric care and\ntreatment is appropriate. But that fact is no different in its\nsignificance from the fact that amongst different adults the proper\nform of health care should vary in line with their various\ndisabilities, diseases, and circumstances. \nThe second sub-class of C-rights are those which Feinberg\ncharacterises as ‘rights-in-trust’ and which he thinks can\nbe resumed under the single title of a ‘right to an open\nfuture’. These are the rights given to the child in the person\nof the adult she will become. They are the rights whose protection\nensures that, as an adult, she will be in a position to exercise her\nA- and A-C-rights to the maximal or at least to a very significant\ndegree. They keep her future open. Such rights impose limits on the\nrights of parents, and also impose duties on the part of the state to\nprotect these rights.  \nA couple of things are worth noting about these rights-in-trust.\nFirst, Feinberg refers to these C-rights as ‘anticipatory\nautonomy rights’, which might suggest that they are only\nA-rights-in-trust. But he also speaks of rights-in-trust of class C as\nprotecting those future interests a child will have as an adult. This\nimplies that they are also anticipatory welfare rights (Feinberg 1980,\n126–7). Hence this sub-class of C-rights ensures that the adult\ncan later exercise both her A-rights (liberty) and her A-C-rights\n(welfare). \nSecond, there is the question of how open a child’s future\nshould be. Some interpret the demand for an education for an\n‘open future’ as requiring individuals to acquire\n‘to the greatest possible extent’ the capacity to choose\nbetween ‘the widest possible variety of ways of life’\n(Arneson and Shapiro 1996, 388). They have pointed out several\nobjections to such a ‘maximising’ interpretation. It may\nnot be possible to quantify in a determinate fashion the number of\noptions open to a future adult. Furthermore some fulfilling life\nchoices are only available at the expense of denying the child a\nnumber of otherwise possible choices. For instance, a child\nintensively trained to realise his considerable innate musical\nabilities may be unable to pursue careers that would have been open to\nhim in the absence of such a dedicated education. The following\nfurther criticisms can be added. Requiring that a child be brought up\nto be able eventually to choose between as many options as possible\nmay impose unreasonable burdens on parents. It also seems implausible\nto think that a child suffers if she is denied one or even several\npossible insignificant further options beyond some threshold number of\nchoices. Is it really harmful to a child that she does not learn to\nplay all of the orchestral instruments and is thereby denied the\nopportunity to pursue a solo career in those she does not? Finally\nsome future options are surely morally base or in some other respect\nwithout value (Mills 2003). \nFeinberg does sometimes talk only of the harms of closing off\nsignificant life choices. Yet he does also on occasion employ the\nlanguage of maximisation. ‘[Education] should send [the child]\nout into the adult world with as many open opportunities as possible,\nthus maximising his chances for self-fulfillment’. (1980, 135;\nsee also 151). However it seems much more plausible to suggest that a\nchild should have enough autonomy to be able to make reasonable life\nchoices. The preconditions of autonomy are both internal (a capacity\nto think for oneself, to acquire and appreciate relevant information,\nand a volitional ability to act independently) and external (the\nprovision of a range of feasible and valuable options). In respect of\nboth conditions it is perfectly possible to have a good sense of what\ncounts as adequate autonomy, even if there is no clear bright line\nmarking the point of sufficiency. \nClosely related to Feinberg’s idea of\n‘rights-in-trust’ is Eekelaar’s idea of a\nchild’s ‘developmental’ rights (Eekelaar 1986).\nThese are the rights of a child to develop her potential so that she\nenters adulthood without disadvantage. Whereas Feinberg attributes the\nrights to the child’s adult-self, the child holding them only in\n‘anticipatory’ form, Eekelaar attributes the rights to the\nadult’s child-self. Arguably this makes no difference since the\nchild and the adult are one and the same person. Although this is a\nmetaphysically contentious claim (Parfit 1984) grant that child and\nadult are merely distinct temporal stages of a single individual.\nWhether each temporal stage of the person has the same interest in the\nchild developing into an adult is a further issue which will be\nconsidered shortly. \nHowever child and adult do stand in an asymmetrical relationship to\none another in a way that does not seem to be true of the different\ntemporal stages of the same adult. After all adult Smith can now\nexercise her liberty rights in such a fashion that at a later time she\nis not able to exercise them and her welfare rights, to the same\ndegree as she can now. Smith can, for instance, choose now to enter\ninto a slavery contract or to engage in a dangerous sport that risks\ndeath or serious disability. A child, on the other hand, is denied the\nright to make choices that will fetter the adult exercise of her\nrights. This is justified by three thoughts. First, a child, unlike an\nadult, simply lacks the ability to make considered choices and should\nnot have liberty rights. An adult can make unwise choices but is\npresumed to possess a general minimal capacity which the child lacks\nto make wise choices. Second, what is done or not done in childhood\naffects the whole of one’s later life and does so in a way that\nis largely irreversible. Third, a life in which choices can be made is\nmore valuable than one in which they cannot. So the preconditions for\nthe possibility of such a life should be secured. That is just to say\nthat the child must allow for the possibility of becoming its adult\nself. \nHowever consider the case of a child who will not develop into an\nadult, say someone who is suffering from a terminal disease that will\nprevent her living beyond the age of majority. Such a child lacks\ndevelopmental rights. Or rather she has them but her circumstances do\nnot allow for their protection. However, she does still have welfare\nand protection rights whose correlate duties can be discharged. The\nchild has an interest in not suffering harm and in enjoying a certain\nstandard of life even if she never lives beyond her childhood. \nWhen, for instance, we provide a child with health care or protect her\nfrom abuse we not only thereby serve her immediate interests as a\nchild but we also ensure that she will grow into a mentally and\nphysically healthy adult. At its simplest a child’s welfare\nright not to be killed is a precondition of the very possibility of\nthere being a future adult with any rights at all. Even the education\nof a child can be represented as not merely of instrumental worth to\nthe future adult but of value to the child here and now. A child has\nan interest now in learning things and does so independently of what\nthis might later mean for her future adult self. (Coady 1992, 51). \nWhat kind of adult does her childhood self have an interest in\ndeveloping into? The answer to this question is important not least\nfor indicating appropriate constraints on any parental upbringing.\nThere is a very influential and recognisably liberal view of what sort\nof adult a child has an interest in developing into. This is an\nautonomous individual, one able independently to evaluate and to\nchoose as appropriate its own ends. On the liberal view a child is not\nautonomous but can with the proper upbringing become autonomous. This\nview is most directly contrasted with a conception of the individual\nas equipped with a set of values and beliefs, authoritatively acquired\nduring its childhood as a result of its upbringing, and not open to\nrevision, or at least not open to any substantial revision. However an\nemphasis upon the capacity to revise one’s ends may be at the\nexpense of a deeper understanding of autonomy as a capacity rationally\nto adhere to some ends (Callan 2002). \nReturning to the case of the child with the terminal illness. She will\nnot develop into an adult. Can we say of anybody that she has an\ninterest, as a child, in developing into an adult, an interest that is\nfrustrated by her terminal condition? Or is there an interest in only\nbeing a child and never becoming an adult? Grant that the child-Q and\nthe adult-Q are two stages of one and the same individual. Could we\nspeak of a conflict between the present interest of child-Q in staying\na child and the future interest of adult-Q in child-Q developing into\nher later adult self? The latter interest seems perfectly\nstraightforward. However it is at least controversial whether\neverybody does have an interest in growing up. Work on the putative\ngoods of childhood can be used to argue that childhood as such has a\nvalue that adulthood does not, with the further questions arising of\nwhether the former value exceeds the latter and of whether they can be\ncompared at all (Gheaus 2015; Hannan 2018). It has has been argued\nthat it would be better for human beings never to have been born\n(Benatar 2008). Even if this is not a general truth it may be true of\nsome humans that not growing into adulthood and ceasing to exist is\nbetter than becoming an adult. This might be true, for instance, of\nsomebody facing the prospect of a life of unrelieved, extreme pain and\nmisery. Could there be an interest—even without such a\nprospect—in being forever child?T \nSuch an interest cannot be physically satisfied in this world. It is\nsatisfied in the fictional world of Peter Pan but the author of that\nfantasy, J.M. Barrie, clearly deprecates his eponymous hero’s\ninfantile desire to escape the realities of the world (Barrie 1995).\nIf we mean only by the imagined interest that of remaining childish\nthen it is hard to see how any individual in our world could, if\nrational, have such an interest. It is one thing to be a child forever\nin a child’s world as Peter Pan is. It is quite another to\nremain a child in our adult world. Childhood is something best\nappreciated by the child. It is also something that needs to be left\nbehind. In the words of Paul, ‘When I was a child, I spoke as a\nchild, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I\nbecame a man I put away these childish things’ (I Corinthians\n13:11). \nIf children are not thought to have the A-rights, and, chiefly, do not\nhave the liberty rights to choose for themselves how to conduct their\nlives, nevertheless they are not morally abandoned to their own\ndevices. In the first place it is a standard principle of child\nwelfare law and policy that the ‘best interests’ of a\nchild should be promoted. Article 3.1 of the United Nations Convention\non the Rights of the Child states that ‘In all actions\nconcerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social\nwelfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or\nlegislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary\nconsideration’ (United Nations 1989).  \nSecond, Article 12.1 of the Convention asserts that, ‘States\nParties shall assure to the child who is capable of forming his or her\nown views the right to express those views freely in all matters\naffecting the child, the views of the child being given due weight in\naccordance with the age and maturity of the child’ (United\nNations 1989). \nSection 8 discusses the right to be heard. This section discusses the\nbest interest principle, henceforward the BIP. The principle has been\ngiven different explicit formulations. Indeed it should be noted that\nthe principle’s possible definitions vary in at least two\nimportant dimensions: what is being given weight, and how much weight\nit is being given. Thus we may speak of a child’s ‘best\ninterests’ or simply of a child’s ‘interests’\nor ‘welfare’. The former is the more familiar version of\nthe principle and it is this understanding of the principle that will\nbe discussed. The difficulties with this maximising interpretation\nwill be considered in due course. \nAs to the weight of the principle the distinct terms\n‘paramount’ and ‘primary’ have been employed,\nalong with either the definite or indefinite article, to qualify the\nconsideration that should be given to a child’s (best)\ninterests. There are therefore at least four possible weightings: (a)\nthe paramount; (b) a paramount; (c) the primary; (d) a primary. A\nfifth—that a child’s (best) interests should merely be\n‘a consideration’—is otiose. Some consideration\nshould obviously be given to a child’s interests. The question\nhowever is how much. The distinction between ‘paramount’\nand ‘primary’ may be understood as follows. A\nconsideration that is paramount outranks and trumps all other\nconsiderations. It is, in effect, the only consideration determinative\nof an outcome. A consideration that is ‘primary’ is a\nleading consideration, one that is first in rank among several. But\nalthough no considerations outrank a primary consideration there may\nbe other considerations of equal, first rank. Furthermore a leading\nconsideration does not trump even if it outranks all other\nconsiderations. A primary consideration is not the only consideration\ndeterminative of an outcome. \nSo it should be evident that (a) and (b) are equivalent, and that the\nreal contrast is between a paramount consideration that trumps all\nothers and a primary one that need not. In effect the interesting\nchoice is between (a) and (d). That is, one between a child’s\n(best) interests being the only consideration and their being an\nimportant but not the sole consideration. Indeed a debate took place\nas to which of these two versions should be included within the UN\nConvention on the Rights of the Child with the weaker formulation\nbeing eventually adopted (Alston 1994 12).  \nWe can speak either of ‘a’ child or, more generally, of\n‘children’. There is a difference between considering how\nin some matter the child most directly concerned is affected and\nconsidering how any policy or action in respect of that one child may\nalso have consequences for other children. Indeed we might consider\nhow any policy or action at all has implications—even if very\nindirect and attenuated—for all children. However, it is\nplausible to construe a use of ‘children’ within a\nformulation of the BIP as requiring us to attend to the impact of a\npolicy, practice, or activity upon those young persons most obviously\nand directly affected. The BIP’s origins are to be found in\ncustody disputes where the law had to make a determination in respect\nof a couple’s children. Even if there were several children the\ncourt had to decide in respect of each individual child what was the\nmost appropriate course of action. The provenance of the BIP shows\nitself in the continued use of the singular term\n‘child’. \nThere is a still further question of how we should understand the\nscope of the best-interests principle. The BIP has operated in at\nleast two important domains (Kopelman 1997a). One is in the medical\ncontext when determining which option should be selected for an ill or\ndiseased child. The second is in custody disputes following the\nseparation or divorce of the child’s guardians. Here, where\nthere is unresolved argument as to who should now raise the child, the\ncourt must decide. However, beyond these two specified domains, the\nBIP has also been given broader application in respect of all policies\nand laws affecting children. This is certainly what the UN Convention\nArticle 3.1 appears to require. \nThere are at least two kinds of difficulty in accepting the BIP (for a\nsummary of various criticisms see Kopelman 1997b). The first of these\nconcerns the import of the principle, the second concerns how we\nshould interpret ‘best interests’. Each will be considered\nin turn. As to its import the BIP is, in the first instance, a\nmaximising maxim. It requires that the best shall be done for a child\nand not simply that good or enough must be done. One must act\n‘so as to promote maximally the good’ of the child\n(Buchanan and Brock 1989, 10). \nIn some contexts where the BIP operates there appears to be a\ndeterminate number of options, and perhaps even only a pair of\noptions. This seems to be the case in custody disputes and medical\ndecision-making. In this context the better option is the best. By\ncontrast in the area of general policy affecting children there seem\nto be very many different possibilities. Yet even with custody and\nmedical decisions we can expand the range of possible options. Thus\nwhat might be best for the child is not that she is cared for by\neither of the parents claiming custody, but that she is adopted by\nsomeone else entirely. Again, what might be best for the child is not\nthat she receive the medical treatment on offer rather than not do so,\nthough it may well be better that she does. What is best is that she\nis treated by the most skilled medical personnel within the finest\nmedical facility, with no expense spared, and so on. \nBut then the obvious criticism of the BIP is that it is unfeasibly\ndemanding of agencies charged with the care of children. Should we\nreally demand that our law and policy makers do the best for children\nrather than charge them with doing enough for children? We do not, it\nseems, require parents to promote their children’s best\ninterests. Nor should we. Indeed the standard principles of child\nwelfare policy, even when they include a version of the best-interests\nmaxim, do not stipulate that a child’s parents shall do more\nthan ensure that the child receives a threshold of care. Beyond that\nparents are not normally required maximally to promote their\nchild’s interests, and indeed they have considerable discretion\nas to how they raise the child. So the BIP is not best interpreted as\na maximising principle. We should do so much for a child; we should\nnot be obliged to do everything that in principle we might do. \nA second problem of the import of the BIP is that it does not, as it\nstands, take account of the interests of others. In the first place I\nmight be able to improve the situation of child A but only at the cost\nof worsening that of child B. Every child should be considered of\nequal value. Yet we may not be able to promote the interests of every\nchild to the same degree. The BIP directs courts, social workers or\nmedical practitioners in some case to promote the interests of a\nparticular child. This should not be done by treating the interests of\nany other child who might be affected as having no value or a lesser\nvalue than those of the particular child attended to. Yet, as with\nadults there are questions of what fairness requires in balancing the\ninterests of the different children affected by any decision or state\nof affairs. It would not be reasonable to expect that parents should\nview the interests of their own children as having the same weight as\nthat of other children. It is reasonable to ask policy makers and care\nprofessionals to do so. \nIn the second place we cannot be required to promote the best\ninterests of a child over and above, and without regard to, the\ninterests of any relevant adult. It might be in the best interests of\na child that her guardian give up every waking minute to her care. But\nno adult should have to sacrifice her own welfare for that of her\nchild. The BIP should thus be interpreted so as to give at least equal\nconsideration to the interests of any adults affected by policies and\nactions promoting the child’s welfare. \nThe second set of difficulties surrounding the BIP concern the\ninterpretation of ‘best interests’. One way to understand\nthis phrase is by reference to what a child would choose for herself\nunder specified hypothetical circumstances. We could call this the\n‘hypothetical choice’ interpretation of the BIP. The other\nway to understand ‘best interests’ is simply through\noffering an account of what is, as a matter of fact, best for the\nchild, an account which is distinct from and independent of the\nchild’s desires, actual or hypothetical. Let us call this the\n‘objectivist’ interpretation of the BIP. Each\ninterpretation will now be examined in turn. \nThe ‘objectivist’ interpretation of the BIP is beset by a\nnumber of difficulties. Some urge that what is best for any child is\nnecessarily indeterminate. There certainly is no fact of the matter in\nthis regard for we must attach values to the options and their\noutcomes in respect of any choice of action towards a child. However\nit will be said that independently of questions of value we cannot,\nwith certainty, determine what is best for a child. We cannot in\npractice make complete and accurate assessments of what will be the\noutcome of each and every policy option that we might adopt in respect\nof a child (Mnookin 1979). How can we know with certainty whether this\nchild will flourish if raised by this set of parents rather than by\nsome others in an alternative setting? Even where we are seeking to\nrank the outcomes of the options within a simple custody dispute\nbetween mother and father things may prove impossibly difficult. After\nall, any number of things may happen if the child is in the\nmother’s custody, and the same is true if the child is given to\nthe father. The BIP is indeterminate even where there are only two\npossible decisions to be made (Elster 1989, 134–139). \nThis difficulty can be spelled out in the following fashion. Imagine\nthat indeterminacy afflicts each of the four conditions of a full\ndecision procedure (Parker 1994, 29–31). For a decision to be\nmade the possible options must be known, the possible outcomes of each\npossible option must be known, the probabilities of each possible\noutcome occurring must be known, and the value of each outcome must be\nknown. Independently of the uncertainty in respect of the last\ncondition—value of the outcomes—there is uncertainty in\nrespect of the other three conditions. This is probably true. However,\nit is not clear why the problem is one that is especially or uniquely\ntrue of policies affecting children. Any political or legal\ndetermination is going to face such indeterminacy in the specification\nof choices and their outcomes. \nOf course once we put values back into the equation there is,\narguably, clear indeterminacy. Moral pluralists will hold that it is\nnot possible to rank as better or worse different kinds of life. Each\nrealises its own distinctive but strictly incommensurable set of human\nexcellences. How then can we say that there is a best life for a child\nto grow into, rather than a range of equally possible yet incomparable\nlives? \nThe pluralist claim is not directed uniquely at the case of children.\nThe value of some at least of the lives of adults, are for the\npluralist, strictly incomparable. Grant that the pluralist claim is\nfalse and assume that there is for each and every child a uniquely\nbest life that it could be brought to lead. There is a still further\ndifficulty. We do happen to disagree in our basic values. Indeed it is\na commonplace of contemporary moral and political philosophy that\nequally sincere, conscientious, and reasonable individuals espouse\nfundamentally different, and frequently conflicting, views about\nmorality. There is what John Rawls has termed the ‘fact of\npluralism’ (Rawls 1993, xvi-xvii). As a society we may be able\nto agree about what is a poor, neglectful or abusive upbringing, but\nwe are likely to be in irresolvable disagreement about what\nis‘good’, even what is ‘better’, parenting\n(McGough 1995, 375). We just cannot agree what is in a child’s\nbest interests. This is important for a further reason. An education\nor upbringing shapes the values of the emerging adult. Whether the\nadult’s life goes better or worse will depend crucially on how\nshe evaluates her life in the light of these values. Educators and\nparents in acting for a child’s best interest are also making a\ndifference to the kind of adult thereby formed, and, in consequence,\nto the goodness of the life she will lead. \nThe fact of extensive disagreement about what is best for children, or\nfor a child, is often set in the context of broader cultural\ndisagreements about morality in general. It is said that the BIP is\nsubverted, or at least rendered deeply problematic, by the existence\nof these deep and pervasive cultural disagreements (Alston (ed.)\n1994). Care is needed. The statement ‘what is best for a child\nis different in different cultures’ is ambiguous. In the first\nplace, the phrase ‘in different cultures’ may be\ninterpreted as meaning something like ‘in different\ncircumstances’. Most moral philosophers will acknowledge that a\nuniversal moral principle that all are agreed upon can nevertheless\nhave differential application in differently specified circumstances.\nHere we do not dispute what in general terms is best for a child. But\nwe do recognise that what it is best to do for any individual child\nwill depend on the particular conditions in which that child finds\nitself. \nOn the other hand what is meant by the statement ‘what is best\nfor a child is different in different cultures’ may be that\nthere is no general agreement across cultures about what is best for a\nchild. Each culture has its own understanding of what is in a\nchild’s best interests. There is a BIP specific to each culture.\nWhat culture A thinks is best for any child is best for any\nchild. What culture B thinks is best for any child—even\nthough it contradicts what culture A thinks best—is also what is\nbest for any child. Moral relativism, in some form, has its defenders\nbut its attendant problems are well documented. \nIf the claim ‘what is best for a child is different in different\ncultures’ is a report of cultural difference—what each\nculture believes to be best for its children differs—then it is\nstill consistent with the BIP having a single universal content. What\nis best for children is the same whatever the culture, and allowing\nfor the variation in application of the same principle to different\ncontexts. It is just that some cultures do not adhere to the BIP in\nthis form. However things are clearly not that simple. It is one thing\nto acknowledge in principle that there must be a single BIP; it is\nquite another to find agreement on what that principle is. The\ndiscussions surrounding the formulation of international conventions\nof human rights have been notoriously beset by significant, and\nculturally based, differences of moral and political outlook. The\nUnited Nations Conventions on the Rights of the Child was no different\n(LeBlanc 1995). \nEven within single cultures which share a broad understanding of what\nis in a child’s best interests there will nevertheless be some\nmeasure of disagreement. For instance, within Western societies there\nare continuing disputes about whether it is morally proper to smack a\nchild. \nBy contrast with an ‘objectivist’ interpretation of the\nBIP what is best for a child can be understood in terms of a\nchild’s hypothetical choices. Strictly speaking a hypothetical\nchoice interpretation of the BIP amounts to a distinct principle. It\nis one Buchanan and Brock define as that of the ‘substituted\njudgement’—‘acting according to what the incompetent\nindividual, if competent, would choose’ (Buchanan and Brock\n1989, 10). However it is natural to think that what is best for\nsomeone is what they themselves would choose if fully informed and\ndeliberating fully rationally. Thus a striking and influential thought\nin this context is that we choose what is best for the child if we\nchoose for the child as the child would choose for herself if the\nchild were adult. For instance John Rawls thinks the following\nformulation defines the acceptable paternalism of a guardian’s\ntreatment of his child: ‘We must choose for others as we have\nreason to believe they would choose for themselves if they were at the\nage of reason and deciding rationally’ (Rawls 1999, 183). This\napparently simple formulation is in fact susceptible of three quite\ndifferent interpretations, each of which brings with it its own\nproblems. In each case we are seeking to specify the adult person who\nchooses for the child. \nWe might first mean that we should choose for this child as the\nparticular adult the child will become would choose. However this does\nnot determine a unique choice for, crucially, the nature of the\nparticular adult that the child will become depends on the choices\nthat are made for it whilst a child. We can conceive of each of the\ndifferent adult selves the child might develop into approving,\nrespectively, of the different choices made for its childhood\nself—choices which were responsible for the development of these\ndifferent selves. Let us take a very basic example. Should we allow\nthe child to go off and play football with his peers, or require him\nto attend his violin lessons? The child who is allowed to play\nfootball becomes a well-paid sportsman who, retrospectively, approves\nof the decision to free him from music lessons which hampered his\nability to develop his footballing skills. On the other hand the child\nwho is made to practise his violin progresses to a fulfilling solo\ncareer. This adult—by contrast with the footballer he did not\nbecome—approves of the enforced musical education away from\nfootball that allowed him to have such a career. \nThe second sense we might give to the phrase ‘choose for the\nchild as the child would if adult’ is by thinking of the\nsituation in which the choice confronts the child, and then choosing\nas an adult would. The person who chooses for the child is any adult.\nThis will serve well enough for some choices where there is no doubt\nas to what a rational adult would choose. In classic adult-child\npaternalistic scenarios we are not unclear or undecided about what we\nas adults should do. Would a rational adult choose to stick her hand\nin the fire, walk out into the traffic, eat whatever was placed in\nfront of her? However if the adult is confronted with other sorts of\nchoices the answer is far less clear. Faced with our imagined choice\nbetween playing football and a music lesson how would the adult\nchoose? This of course is wholly indeterminate since different adults\nwill presumably choose differently in the same situation. The adult\nwho prefers football to music will choose the former; the adult who\nprefers music will choose otherwise. \nThis leads us then to the third possible interpretation. The adult\nperson who chooses for the child is an adult analogue of the child.\nThis is not the child’s future adult self, which as we have seen\nis indeterminate, but this child made into an adult version of itself.\nThat is, we do not imagine this child developing in the future into\nits particular adult self. Rather we imagine a mature or grown-up\nversion of this child now making choices. This interpretation however\nwill still not work. The adult version of the child is one with\nchildish beliefs and desires filtered out. But, in the first place, it\nis not clear what remains of the child in any choice situation\nrendered hypothetical in this fashion. For the child just is someone\nwho has these childish beliefs and desires. What is it to be a child\nif not to think and want as a child does? Second, it is entirely\nindeterminate what should replace these beliefs and desires. \nThese varying interpretations of what it is to choose for a child as\nan adult would, and their attendant difficulties, display the problems\nof construing the best interests of a child in terms of the\nhypothetically adult choices the child would make. The problems are in\nthe last analysis due to the following basic fact. In the cases of\nadults paternalistically choosing for other adults, and where the\npaternalism is warranted by a temporary failure of reason, we can have\na determinate sense of how the adult would have chosen in the absence\nof the failure. If she had known that the bridge was unsafe she would\nhave chosen not to cross it. If she was not persuaded by the influence\nof the drug to think she could fly she would not have decided to jump\noff the tall building. And so on. \nHowever in the case of children we cannot cash out these hypothetical\nconditionals. We do not know what a child would choose if possessed of\nadult rational powers of choice because what makes a child a child\njust is its lack of such powers (its ignorance, inconstant wants,\ninconsistent beliefs, and limited powers of ratiocination). At the\nsame time we cannot ask how an adult would choose if in the\nchild’s situation just because an adult would not be in that\nsituation, or would not be in a child’s situation. We must, it\nseems, choose for a child because a child cannot choose for itself,\nand we must choose what is best for a child not what some imagined\nadult version of the child would choose for itself. \nThe putative possession by a child of a right to an ‘open\nfuture’ together with the imperative to promote any\nchild’s best interests raises the question of what, if anything,\nis wrong with the transmission to a child of cultural values. These\nare those values by which the child’s parent lives and which may\nalso help to define the identity of a community. Article 2 of the\nUNCRC accords the child a right to non-discrimination on various\ngrounds including ‘ national, ethnic or social origin’ and\nArticle 30 recognises that a child belonging to an ‘ethnic,\nreligious or linguistic’ minority ‘shall not be denied the\nright, in community with other members of his or her group, to enjoy\nhis or her own culture, to profess and practise his or her own\nreligion, or to use his or her own language.’ \nYet for many liberals there is a tension between the recognition of\nsuch rights and the requirement that a child not be inducted into a\ncommunity in such a manner that his or her future adult choices are\nconstrained. The main way in which this is set out is by means of an\nemphasis upon a liberal ideal of an autonomous life, one in which an\nindividual is able both to form his or her own conception of the good\nlife to lead and is not prevented – by external social\ncircumstances or the actions of others – from being able to lead\nthe preferred life.  Often the target that is juxtaposed to such\na liberal ideal is the values of religious minorities. The Supreme\nCourt judgment that prompted Joel Feinberg’s defence of a\nchild’s right to an ‘open future’, and which has\nbeen extensively discussed is Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972). This\nexempted the Amish community from the requirement to keep their\nchildren in school to the age others are so required in the interests\nof maintaining that community’s identity. Arneson and Shapiro in\nresponse contrast  ‘religious traditionalist’ and a\n‘secular worldly’ ways of life, seeing an education for\nthe latter as the best preparation for an open future (Arneson and\nShapiro 1996). \nThe problem with this approach is that the preferential treatment\n– in the way that children are schooled – is both\ndiscriminatory and may violate the central precept of liberal\nneutrality, the requirement that the state not, in its law and\npolicies, favour any conception of the good (See the entry on\nPerfectionism in Moral and Political Philosophy). Moreover, some\nliberals will argue that the character traits and dispositions of\nautonomy, for instance steadfastness of character, are best taught by\nbeing raised in adherence to a particular way of life, such as one of\nreligious faith (Callan, 2002; Burtt 1996). \nLiberals may escape the charge of violating the principle of\nneutrality by arguing that a liberal society requires that its\ncitizens be motivated by a sense of justice and an ability to\nparticipate effectively within democratic institutions. This\nrequirement is satisfied only if children are brought up in certain\nvalues and are able, when adults, to make maximally autonomous\nchoices. In this manner the promotion of autonomy and an open future\ncan be seen as an indirect consequence of a necessary education in\nthose civic capacities that are the necessary precondition of stable\nand sustainable liberal institutions. \nThe tension that is broached by a child’s right to an open\nfuture is given a clear and provocative reading in Matthew\nClayton’s book (Clayton 2006). He argues that parents may not\n‘enroll their children into comprehensive doctrines’, in\nother words bring them up to believe in general truths about the best\nway to lead a life, whatever the provenance of those truths. Thus his\nview is broader than a critique of a religious education. But at the\nsame time it would indict the vast majority of conscientious parents\nseeking to bring up their children as they see best. \nHis defence of this view relies on a claimed analogy between the\nexercises of political and of parental power. The former is only\nlegitimate on liberal grounds in the absence of any appeal to the\ncorrectness of some comprehensive doctrine. Clayton thinks that the\nsimilarities between the two exercises of power are sufficiently\nstrong and robust for parental conduct to be constrained by the same\nliberal principle of legitimacy. \nIn response it may be argued that the two domains of power are not\nanalogous. It may also be suggested that there is a morally relevant\ndifference between parents setting out to enrol their children in a\ncomprehensive doctrine and children coming to share such a doctrine as\na consequence of sharing their life with their parents (Archard 2002).\nIndeed if the institution of the family as an essentially intimate and\nprivate community of adults and children can be defended and if,\nfurther, adults have a protected right to lead their lives by the\nlight of their preferred conception of the good, then such unintended\nenrolment is inevitable. \nIt is of course a further question of whether certain communal values\nviolate liberal values other than autonomy – such as equality.\nIt would be wrong then to rear boys and girls in gendered stereotypes\nthat perpetuate inequality and discrimination. \nThe right to be heard is a valuable right. What makes it valuable is\nboth that there is a point to making one’s views known and,\nfurther, that making one’s views known makes a difference. It\nmatters to me that I can speak out on political questions. It matters\nalso, and probably more, if what I say leads to the changes I favour.\nCorrelatively it is true both that I do not want to be silenced and\nthat I do not want the statement of my views to be ineffectual. As a\nfurther general point it is clear that there will always be some\nissues on which it is more important that I be allowed to speak and\nthat what I say about these issues carries weight in determining\noutcomes. Those are the issues that matter to me, and the more they\nmatter the more important it is that I have the freedom to speak about\nthem and be heard. On one account since children’s views should\nnot be ‘authoritative’, that is determinative of what is\ndone, they have only a ‘consultative’ role (Brighouse\n2003). They may influence an outcome by, most obviously, providing\nthose who do make the decisions affecting a child’s interests\nwith a clearer picture of what in fact is in those interests. On\nanother account encouraging and according a weight to the expression\nof children’s views—even where this is unlikely to affect\noutcomes in line with the views’ content—is valuable just\nbecause the child is capable of expressing a view and deserves to be\nlistened to (Archard and Skivenes 2009). \nHow is it with the child’s right to be heard? It will be\nimportant for the child to be listened to. But it is also important\nthat the child is heard in the sense that her views are given due\nconsideration and may influence what is done. Note that the\nchild’s right to be heard on matters affecting its own interests\nis a substitute for the liberty right to make one’s own choices.\nThe right to be heard is only a right to have the opportunity to\ninfluence the person who will otherwise choose for the child. The\npower to make those choices resides with the adult guardian or\nrepresentative of the child. All the child retains is the right to try\nto motivate that adult to choose as the child herself would choose if\nshe was allowed to. \nArticle 12.1 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the\nChild not only accords the child the right freely to express its views\non matters affecting the child. It also, and crucially, gives the\nchild an assurance that these views will be given ‘due weight in\naccordance with the age and maturity of the child’. Great\nemphasis is now placed on what are termed a child’s\n‘participation rights’ as opposed to his or her\n‘protection rights’. The latter, as the name suggests,\nprotect the child from violent, abusive, cruel or exploitative\ntreatment. ‘Participation rights’ by contrast, give the\nchild some entitlement to be the agents of their own lives. Article\n12.1 provides a crucial underpinning justification for such rights.\nThere are problems in understanding how practically to implement such\nrights (Ang et al, 2006). There are also theoretical issues in making\nprecise sense of what a right such as that enshrined in Article 12.1\nmight mean. The celebrated British legal judgement in the Gillick case\n(Gillick [1986]) provides a useful guide. This judgement has been\nextensively discussed, and it has also been highly influential in\nmatters relating to the consent of children to medical treatment. \nThe Gillick judgement arose from the dissatisfaction of a mother with\nthe failure of her local health authority to withdraw an advisory\ncircular to the area’s doctors. This advised doctors that they\ncould counsel and inform young girls under the age of 16 about sexual\nmatters as well as provide them with contraception, and that they\ncould do this without the consent of the child’s parents. The\nmother, Victoria Gillick, went to court to have the circular declared\nunlawful. The final judgement by the British House of Lords was that\nthe circular was not unlawful. A key issue, relevant to the present\ndiscussion, concerned the proper relationship between the\nchild’s right to decide for itself and the parent’s right\nto decide for the child. \nIn deciding in favour of the health authority one of the Law Lords,\nLord Scarman, made a statement crucial to his finding and one that has\nsubsequently been much cited. It is worth reproducing: \nI would hold that as a matter of law the parental right to determine\nwhether or not their minor child below the age of 16 will have medical\ntreatment terminates if and when the child achieves a sufficient\nunderstanding and intelligence to enable him to understand fully what\nis proposed. (Gillick [1986] 186, 188–9) \nLet me now discuss various issues that arise. First, what does it mean\nfor a child to get to a particular point in their development? On what\ncould be called the threshold interpretation once a child has achieved\na certain level of competence her views as to what shall happen to her\nhave a determinate weight, either amounting to a liberty right of\nchoice (on a strong version) or (on a weak version) being counted in\nthe balance against her parents’ views and the state’s\njudgement of her best interests. On what could be called the\nproportionality interpretation the child’s views progressively\nincrease in weight as she gains a greater competence to choose for\nherself. They increase up to the acquisition of a full liberty right\nof choice. \nSecond, on either the threshold or the proportionality account we need\na measure of that ability that marks the threshold or is simply\nprogressively acquired. How much intelligence and understanding, for\ninstance, is sufficient? In the first place this measure must be taken\nindependently of any judgement of what is in the child’s best\ninterest. That a child would choose what is taken to be in her best\ninterests is at most evidence that she does have sufficient\nintelligence and understanding of the relevant issue. Her making such\na choice is not a necessary condition of her having the requisite\nability. Similarly the making by a child of a poor choice is not\nconclusive evidence of her general incapacity to choose for herself.\nWise adults can occasionally make stupid decisions just as fools\nsometimes get it right. \nIn the Gillick judgement Scarman required of the child that she\nmanifest an understanding of the ‘nature’ of the\ncontraceptive advice offered and ‘also have a sufficient\nmaturity to understand what is involved’ (Gillick [1986] 189).\nWe can distinguish here a number of possible elements. There is,\nfirst, knowledge of certain facts. A child, for instance, knows that a\ncontraceptive acts to prevent conception that might otherwise result\nfrom sexual intercourse. Another child, by contrast, could simply be\nignorant of or unable to comprehend the facts of reproduction. There\nis, second, an understanding of what follows for the child from an act\nor its omission. Thus failure to use a contraceptive could lead a\nyoung person who had sexual intercourse to become pregnant. These two\nunderstandings together constitute knowledge of the\n‘nature’ of the act. Finally there is what arguably comes\nwith ‘maturity’ which is the ability to appreciate the\nsignificance both of an act or its omission and of the relevant\nconsequences. It is one thing to know what it is to become pregnant,\nand another to understand what that means. This latter understanding\ninvolves realising that pregnancy brings in its wake physical changes,\nthat any resultant birth leaves a young person with a child to care\nfor, and so on. Scarman even insisted that the child would need to\nhave an appreciation of the ‘moral and family’ questions\ninvolved. \nThird, it is important in measuring a child’s competence against\nthat in respect of which he or she is expressing a view to distinguish\nbetween the complexity and the seriousness of the matter. A simple\nchoice—for instance that between only two options such as\nwhether or not to have a life-saving operation—may nevertheless\nbe portentous, having enormous and far-reaching consequences. It may\nthus require much greater appreciation of what is involved than a more\ncomplex decision, one that ranges over many possibilities. Yet the\nlatter kind of choice—consider choosing a five-course meal from\na very large menu—is far less serious in its consequences. In\nshort, the difficulty or complexity of a choice should not be confused\nwith its importance or significance for the child. \nFourth, the English courts at least have detected a fundamental\nasymmetry between refusing and choosing to have treatment. A competent\nadult has a right both to choose to have treatment and to refuse it.\nShould this not also be the case with a competent child? A 15-year-old\nwho wants to have a particular operation against her parents’\nwishes and even contrary to the best judgement of her doctors may be\njudged competent and thus have her wishes respected. However the\nEnglish courts in a series of judgements after Gillick have argued\nthat matters are somehow different when it is a case of a child\nrefusing an operation.  \nOf course there is no inconsistency if a refusal requires a greater\ndegree of understanding and appreciation of the issues than a positive\nacceptance. But where the choice is a simple disjunction it is hard to\nsee how this can be the case. Are not the issues at stake the same for\nboth disjuncts? If the courts believe that an obligation to act in the\nbest interests of the child trumps one to respect the wishes of a\ncompetent child it needs to be shown why this obligation does not have\nforce in all circumstances. Why would a court not deny treatment to a\nchild it does not believe in her best interests when it judges her\ncompetent to choose? If a child is competent then she is in all\nsignificant and relevant respects the equal of an adult and should be\nable both to choose and to refuse treatment. \nThree final comments on the child’s right to choose are in\norder. First, what is deemed to be in the child’s best interests\nis evidence for but not finally determinative of a judgement as to the\ncompetence of the child. Nevertheless balancing a child’s right\nto be heard against a child’s right to have its best interests\npromoted is difficult. Second, it is arguably enough to show a\nchild’s competence that a child understands the nature of the\nact. After all no more is needed for an adult’s consent to be\ninformed. In the law of contract adults need only to know what they\nare signing up to. They do not need a full appreciation of the\ncontract’s significance and of its import for their future\nlives. Third, Gillick competence as specified is very demanding.\nIndeed there are many adults who in making their choices fail to\ndisplay the maturity and ‘understanding of what is\ninvolved’ that is dictated as necessary for the child. Why then\nshould a child have to display a competence that many adults lack both\nin general and in particular cases? \nOne important, indeed central, manner of understanding the moral\nstatus of the child is by questioning whether or not children have\nrights. It is normally thought that according to the\n‘will’ theory of rights children cannot have rights,\nwhereas according to the ‘interest’ theory they can. It\nis, however, at least possible on the ‘will’ theory that\nchildren could have rights, albeit ones that are exercised by trustees\nor representatives.  \nChild ‘liberationists’ claim that children have all the\nrights that adults do. Others deny this, either believing that\nchildren have no rights or believing that children have only some of\nthe rights which adults possess. Those who believe children have no\nrights deny that children are qualified as adults are to have rights.\nThey further argue that the ascription of rights to children manifests\na misunderstanding of what children are like and of the nature of\nfamily relationships. Those who deny children all or some of the\nrights possessed by adults nevertheless believe that children, as\nhumans, have a certain moral status that ought to be protected. \nThose who say that drawing a line between adults and children in\nrespect of their possession of rights is arbitrary may mean different\nthings. To deny that different capacities are progressively acquired\nat different ages is implausible. To insist that drawing a line as\nsuch is wrong ignores the point of doing so, and recourse to the\nalternative of a competency test is not appropriate or practicable. On\nthe standard view children have welfare but not liberty rights,\nwhereas adults have both. Adults also have the right that their\nchildhood selves shall grow up to be adults of a certain sort.\nChildren do not have an interest in remaining in childhood. \nThe best-interest principle should arguably have only limited\napplication. It is not possible unambiguously to interpret the best\ninterests of a child in terms of a hypothetical adult self, and any\nobjective interpretation will be the subject of contested views. A\nchild’s right to be heard in matters affecting its interests is\na substitute not a complement to the right of choosing for herself,\nand the Gillick competence which qualifies a child to exercise its\nrights of decision-making is arguably stringently defined.","contact.mail":"d.archard@qub.ac.uk","contact.domain":"qub.ac.uk"}]
