In addition to the usual singular quantification, as\nin\n\n(1) There is\nan apple on the table\n\nthere is plural quantification, as in \n\n(2) There are\nsome apples on the table.\n\nEver since Frege, formal logic has favored the two singular\nquantifiers \\(\\forall{x}\\) and \\(\\exists{x}\\) over their plural\ncounterparts \\(\\forall{xx}\\) and \\(\\exists{xx}\\) (to be read as\nfor any things \\(xx\\) and there are some things\n\\(xx)\\). But in recent decades it has been argued that we have good\nreason to admit among our primitive logical notions also the plural\nquantifiers \\(\\forall{xx}\\) and \\(\\exists{xx}\\) (Boolos 1984 and\n1985a). \n\n\nMore controversially, it has been argued that the resulting formal\nsystem with plural as well as singular quantification qualifies as\n“pure logic”; in particular, that it is universally\napplicable, ontologically innocent, and perfectly well understood. In\naddition to being interesting in its own right, this thesis will, if\ncorrect, make plural quantification available as an innocent but\nextremely powerful tool in metaphysics, philosophy of mathematics, and\nphilosophical logic. For instance, George Boolos has used plural\nquantification to interpret monadic second-order\n logic[1]\n and has argued on this basis that monadic second-order logic\nqualifies as “pure logic”. Plural quantification has also\nbeen used in attempts to defend logicist ideas, to account for set\ntheory, and to eliminate ontological commitments to mathematical\nobjects and complex objects.\n\nThe logical formalisms that have dominated in the analytic tradition\never since Frege do not allow for plural quantification. In\nintroductory logic courses students are therefore typically taught to\nparaphrase away plural locutions. For instance, they may be taught to\nrender “Alice and Bob are hungry” as “Alice is\nhungry & Bob is hungry”, and “There are some apples on\nthe table”, as “\\(\\Exists{x} \\Exists{y} (x\\) is an apple\non the table & \\(y\\) is an apple on the table & \\(x \\ne\ny)\\)”. However, not only are such paraphrases often unnatural,\nbut they may not even be available. One of the most interesting\nexamples of plural locutions which resist singular paraphrase is the\nso-called Geach-Kaplan sentence: \nThis sentence provably has no singular first-order paraphrase using\nonly the predicates occurring in the sentence\n itself.[2] \nHow are we to formalize such sentences? The traditional view, defended\nfor instance by Quine, is that all paraphrases must be given in\nclassical first-order logic, if necessary supplemented with set\ntheory. In particular, Quine suggests that\n (3)\n should be formalized as \n(1973: 111 and 1982:\n 293).[3] \nIn two important articles from the 1980s George Boolos challenges this\ntraditional view (Boolos 1984 and 1985a). He argues that it is simply\na prejudice to insist that the plural locutions of natural language be\nparaphrased away. Instead he suggests that just as the singular\nquantifiers \\(\\Forall{x}\\) and \\(\\Exists{x}\\) get their legitimacy\nfrom the fact that they represent certain quantificational devices in\nnatural language, so do their plural counterparts \\(\\Forall{xx}\\) and\n\\(\\Exists{xx}\\). For there can be no doubt that in natural language we\nuse and understand the expressions “for any things” and\n“there are some things”.[4]\n Since these quantifiers bind variables that take name (rather than\npredicate) position, they are first-order quantifiers, albeit\nplural ones. \nI will now describe a simple formal language which can be used to\nregiment plural quantification as it occurs in English and other\nnatural languages. \nThe formal language \\(L_{\\textrm{PFO}}\\). Let the formal\nlanguage \\(L_{\\textrm{PFO}}\\) (for Plural First-Order) be as\nfollows. \nIn \\(L_{\\textrm{PFO}}\\) we can formalize a number of English claims\ninvolving plurals. For instance,\n (2)\n can be formalized as \nAnd the Geach-Kaplan sentence\n (3)\n can be formalized as  \nHowever, the language \\(L_{\\textrm{PFO}}\\) has one severe limitation.\nWe see this by distinguishing between two kinds of plural predication.\nA predicate \\(P\\) taking plural arguments is said to be\ndistributive just in case it is analytic that: \\(P\\) holds of\nsome things \\(xx\\) if and only if \\(P\\) holds of each \\(u\\) such that\n\\(u\\prec\n xx\\).[5]\n For instance, the predicate “is on the table” is\ndistributive, since it is analytic that some things \\(xx\\) are on the\ntable just in case each of \\(xx\\) is on the table. A predicate \\(P\\)\nthat isn’t distributive is said to be non-distributive\nor\n collective.[6]\n For instance, the predicate “form a circle” is\nnon-distributive, since it is not analytic that whenever some things\n\\(xx\\) form a circle, each of \\(xx\\) forms a circle. Another example\nof non-distributive plural predication is the second argument-place of\nthe logical predicate \\(\\prec\\): for it is not true (let alone\nanalytic) that whenever \\(u\\) is one of \\(xx, u\\) is one of each of\n\\(xx\\). It is therefore both natural and useful to consider a slightly\nricher language: \nShould we also allow predicates with argument places that take both\nsingular and plural arguments? Lots of English\npredicates work this way, for instance “… is/are on the\ntable”. So if our primary interest was to analyze natural\nlanguage, we would probably have to allow such predicates. However,\nfor present purposes it is simpler not to allow such predicates. We\nwill anyway soon allow pluralities that consist of just one\n thing.[8] \nFor now, the formal languages \\(L_{\\textrm{PFO}}\\) and\n\\(L_{\\textrm{PFO}+}\\) will be interpreted only by means of a\ntranslation of them into ordinary English, augmented by indices to\nfacilitate cross-reference (Boolos 1984: 443–5 [1998a:\n67–9]; Rayo 2002: 458–9). (More serious semantic issues\nwill be addressed in\n Section 4,\n where our main question will be whether our theories of plural\nquantification are ontologically committed to any sort of\n“set-like” entities.) The two clauses of this translation\nwhich are immediately concerned with plural terms are \nThe other clauses are obvious, for instance: \\(\\Tr(\\phi \\amp \\psi) =\n(\\Tr(\\phi)\\) and \\(\\Tr(\\psi))\\). This translation allows us to\ninterpret all sentences of \\(L_{\\textrm{PFO}}\\) and\n\\(L_{\\textrm{PFO}+}\\), relying on our intuitive understanding of\nEnglish. It is useful to consider some examples. Applying \\(\\Tr\\) to\n(\\ref{ex2prime}), say, yields: \nWe will now describe a theory PFO of plural first-order\nquantification based on the language \\(L_{\\textrm{PFO}}\\). Let’s\nbegin with an axiomatization of ordinary first-order logic with\nidentity. For our current purposes, it is convenient to axiomatize\nthis logic as a natural deduction system, taking all tautologies as\naxioms and the familiar natural deduction rules governing the singular\nquantifiers and the identity sign as rules of inference. We then\nextend in the obvious way the natural deduction rules for the singular\nquantifiers to the plural ones. Next we need some axioms which for\nsuitable formulas \\(\\phi(x)\\) allow us to talk about the \\(\\phi\\)s. In\nordinary English the use of plural locutions generally signals a\nconcern with two or more objects. But the existence of two or more\nobjects may not be semantically required; for instance, “The\nstudents who register for this class will learn a lot” seems\ncapable of being true even if only one student registers. It is\ntherefore both reasonable and convenient to demand only that there be\nat least one object satisfying \\(\\phi(x)\\). (Most people who write on\nthe subject make this concession.) This gives rise to the plural\ncomprehension axioms, which are the instances of the schema \nwhere \\(\\phi\\) is a formula in \\(L_{\\textrm{PFO}}\\) that contains\n“\\(u\\)” and possibly other variables free but contains no\noccurrence of “\\(xx\\)”. (That is, if something is \\(\\phi\\)\nthen there are some things such that everything is one of them if and\nonly if it is \\(\\phi\\).) In order fully to capture the idea that all\npluralities are non-empty, we also adopt the axiom  \n(That is, for any things, there is something that is one of them.) Let\nPFO+ be the theory based on the language \\(L_{PFO+}\\) which\narises in an analogous way, but which in addition has the following\naxiom schema of extensionality:  \n(That is, for any things\\(_1\\) and any things\\(_2\\) (if something is\none of them\\(_1\\) if and only it is one of them\\(_2\\), then they\\(_1\\)\nare \\(\\phi\\) if and only if they\\(_2\\) are \\(\\phi)\\).) This axiom\nschema ensures that all coextensive pluralities are indiscernible. \nNote on terminology. For ease of communication we will use\nthe word “plurality” without taking a stand on whether\nthere really exist such entities as pluralities. Statements involving\nthe word “plurality” can always be rewritten more\nlongwindedly without use of that word. For instance, the above claim\nthat “all pluralities are non-empty” can be rewritten as\n“whenever there are some things \\(xx\\), there is something \\(u\\)\nwhich is one of the things \\(xx\\)”. Where an ontological claim\n\\(is\\) made, this will be signalled by instead using the locution\n“plural entity”. \nBy “second-order logic” we understand a logic that extends\nordinary first-order logic by allowing for quantification into\npredicate position. For instance, from “\\(a\\) is an\napple” we can in second-order logic infer\n“\\(\\Exists{F}\\mstop Fa\\)”. But the plural logics described\nabove extend ordinary first-order logic in a different way, namely by\nallowing quantification into plural argument position. But\npredicates and plural noun phrases belong to different syntactic and\nsemantic categories. For instance, the former consists of expressions\nthat are unsaturated (in Frege’s sense) — that is, that\ncontain gaps or argument places — whereas the latter consists of\nexpressions that are saturated (Higginbotham 1998: sect. 7; Oliver and\nSmiley 2001; Rayo and Yablo 2001: sect. X; Simons 1997; Williamson\n2003: sect. IX; Yi 2005). Accordingly, second-order quantification and\nplural quantification are generally regarded as different forms of\nquantification. In this section I discuss some of the differences and\nsimilarities.  \n(Readers less interested in technical issues may want to skim this\nsection.) Boolos observed that it is possible to interpret monadic\nsecond-order logic in the theory\n PFO.[9]\n Let MSO be some standard axiomatization of (full\nimpredicative) monadic second-order logic in some suitable language\n\\(L_{\\textrm{MSO}}\\) (Shapiro 1991: ch. 3; Boolos et al.\n2002: ch. 22). Boolos first defines a translation \\(\\Tr'\\) that maps\nany formula of \\(L_{\\textrm{MSO}}\\) to some formula of\n\\(L_{\\textrm{PFO}}\\). This definition, which proceeds by induction on\nthe complexity of the formulas of \\(L_{\\textrm{MSO}}\\), has as its\nonly non-trivial clauses the following two, which are concerned with\nthe second-order variables: \nwhere \\(\\phi*\\) is the result of substituting \\(x_i \\ne x_i\\)\neverywhere for \\(X_j x_i\\). The idea behind these two clauses is to\nreplace talk about concepts (or whatever entities one takes the\nmonadic second-order variables to range over) with talk about the\nobjects that fall under these concepts. Thus, instead of saying that\n\\(x_i\\) falls under the concept \\(X_j\\), we say that \\(x_i\\) is one of\n\\(xx_j\\). The only difficulty is that some concepts have no instances,\nwhereas all pluralities must encompass at least one thing. But the\npossibility that a concept be uninstantiated is accommodated by the\nsecond disjunct on the right-hand side of (9). \nBy induction on derivations in MSO one easily proves that each theorem\nof MSO is mapped to some theorem of PFO. Moreover, it is easy to\ndefine a “reverse” translation that maps formulas of\n\\(L_{\\textrm{PFO}}\\) to formulas of \\(L_{\\textrm{MSO}}\\) and to prove\nthat this translation maps theorems of the former to theorems of the\nlatter. This shows that PFO and MSO are equi-interpretable. A similar\nresult can be proved about PFO+ and an extension MSO+ of MSO\nwhich allows predicates of (first-level) concepts, provided MSO+\ncontains an axiom schema to the effect that coextensive concepts are\nindiscernible. \nIt is important to be clear on what the equi-interpretability of PFO\nand PFO+ with respectively MSO and MSO+ does and does not show. It\nshows that these two pairs of theories are equivalent for most\ntechnical purposes. But by itself it does not show anything about\nthese two pairs of theories’ being equivalent in any of the more\ndemanding senses that philosophers often care about (such as having\nthe same epistemic status, ontological commitments, or degree of\nanalyticity). (For instance PFO is equi-interpretable with atomic\nextensional mereology, which philosophers tend to find much more\nproblematic than PFO.) In order to show that the two pairs of theories\nare equivalent in some philosophically important respect \\(F\\), we\nwould need to show that the above translations preserve\n\\(F\\)-ness. \nAlthough plural quantification provides a fairly natural\ninterpretation of quantification over (monadic) concepts, it\nprovides no natural interpretation of quantification over (polyadic)\nrelations. \nThis limitation can be overcome (at least for technical purposes) if\nthere is a pairing function on the relevant domain, that is, if there\nis a function \\(\\pi\\) such that \\(\\pi(u, v) = \\pi(u', v')\\) just in\ncase \\(u = u'\\) and \\(v = v'\\). For then quantification over dyadic\nrelations can be represented by plural quantification over ordered\npairs. Moreover, by iterated applications of the ordered pair function\nwe can represent \\(n\\)-tuples and thus also quantification over\n\\(n\\)-adic relations. The question is how this pairing function is to\nbe understood. One option is to proceed as in mathematics and simply\npostulate the existence of a pairing function as an abstract\nmathematical object. But this option has the obvious disadvantage of\nstepping outside of what most people are willing to call “pure\nlogic”. A cleverer option, explored in the Appendix to Lewis\n1991 and in Hazen 1997 and 2000, is to simulate talk about ordered\npairs using only resources that arguably are purely logical. It turns\nout that talk about ordered pairs can be simulated in monadic\nthird-order logic, given some plausible extra assumptions.\nMonadic third-order logic can in turn be interpreted either in a\ntheory which combines plural quantification with mereology (Lewis\n1991: ch. 3; Burgess and Rosen 1997: II.C.1) or in terms of\nhigher-level plural quantification\n (Section 2.4). \nAnother way in which plural quantification and second-order\nquantification come apart emerges in modal contexts. It is often a\ncontingent matter whether an object falls under a concept. Although I\nam wearing shoes, I might not have done so. So there is a concept\n\\(F\\) under which I fall but might not have fallen. In contrast, it\nseems that being one of some objects is never contingent. Consider the\npeople \\(aa\\) who are all and only the people currently wearing shoes.\nThen not only am I one of these people, but this seems to hold of\nnecessity (assuming the existence of the relevant objects). Removing\nme from this plurality of people would just result in a different\nplurality. For the plurality \\(aa\\) to be the plurality it is, it must\ninclude precisely the objects that it in fact includes. So in any\nworld in which the objects \\(aa\\) exist at all, I must be one of them.\nTrue, I might not have been wearing shoes. But even so I would have\nbeen one of \\(aa\\), only then \\(aa\\) would not have been all and only\nthe people wearing shoes. Plural names and variables thus seem to be\nrigid in a way that is analogous to the familiar rigidity of singular\nnames and variables: in any world in which a plural term denotes at\nall, it denotes the same objects. In particular it seems that\npluralities are subject to the following two principles: \nwhere \\(\\EExists xx\\) and \\(\\EExists u\\) are suitable formalizations\nof the claims that respectively \\(xx\\) and \\(u\\) exist.[10] \nOne way of going beyond PFO+ would be by allowing quantification into\npredicate positions, including those of predicates taking plural\narguments. Doing so would result in an extension which stands to PFO+\nas ordinary (singular) second-order logic stands to ordinary\n(singular) first-order logic. Such extensions will not be considered\nhere: for whether they are legitimate, and if so what axioms they may\nsupport, has less to do with plurals and plural quantification than it\ndoes with predication and quantification over the semantic values of\n predicates.[11] \nWhat \\(is\\) relevant for present purposes is whether there is some\nform of “super-plural” quantification that stands to\nordinary plural quantification as ordinary plural quantification\nstands to singular quantification. If so, let’s call this\nsecond-level plural quantification. More generally, we may\nattempt to introduce plural quantification of any finite level. This\nwould result in a theory which for technical purposes is just like a\nsimple type theory (Hazen 1997: 247; Linnebo 2003: sect. IV; Rayo\n2006). \nIt is fairly straightforward to develop formal languages and theories\nof higher-level plural quantification (Rayo 2006). For instance, we\ncan introduce variables of the form xxx to be thought of as\nranging over second-level pluralities and the relation \\(xx \\prec_2\\)\nxxx to be understood in analogy with the relation \\(x \\prec\nxx\\). (See Linnebo and Rayo 2012 for extensions to transfinite levels\nand comparison of the resulting theories with those of ordinary set\ntheory.) But can these formal theories of higher-level plural\nquantification be justified by considerations similar to those that\njustify the theories PFO and PFO+? \nBoolos and many other philosophers deny that higher-level plural\nquantification can be thus justified. Two kinds of arguments are given\nfor this view. Firstly, it is argued that a plurality is always a\nplurality of things. But since plural quantification is\nontologically innocent, there are no such things as pluralities. There\nis thus nothing that can be collected into a second-level plurality\n(McKay 2006: 46–53 and 137–139). Secondly, ordinary plural\nquantification is justified by the fact that it captures certain\nquantificational devices of English and other natural languages. But\nEnglish and other natural languages contain no higher-level plural\nquantification (Lewis 1991: 70–71)\n\n \nBoth arguments are controversial. Concerning the first, it is not\nclear why ontology should be relevant to the legitimacy of\nhigher-level plurals quantification. It should be sufficient that the\nbase-level objects can be organized in certain complex ways. For\ninstance, the second-level plurality based on Cheerios organized as\noo oo oo should be no more\nontologically problematic than the first-level plurality based on the\nsame objects organized as oooooo,\nalthough the former has an additional level of structure or\narticulation (Linnebo 2003: 87–8). \nThe second of the above two arguments is also problematic. To begin\nwith, the claim that there are no higher-level plural locutions in\nnatural language is almost certainly false. In Icelandic, for\ninstance, the number words have plural forms which count, not\nindividual objects, but pluralities of objects that form\nnatural groups. Here is an example: \nThis allows us to talk about pairs of shoes as a second-level\nplurality rather than as a first-level plurality of objects such as\npairs. For an English example, consider a video game in which\nany number \\(n\\) of teams can compete in an \\(n\\)-way competition.\nThen the following sentence seems to involve a superplural term: \n(See also Oliver and Smiley 2004: 654–656 and 2005: 1063;\nBen-Yami 2013; and Simons 2016) \nMoreover, the very idea that the legitimacy of higher-level plural\nquantification is decided by the existence or non-existence of\nhigher-level plural locutions in English and other natural languages\nis problematic (Hazen 1993: 138 and 1997: 247; Linnebo 2003: 87; Rayo\n2006). What really matters is presumably whether we can iterate the\nprinciples and considerations on which our understanding of ordinary\nfirst-level plural quantification is based: if we can, then\nhigher-level plural quantification will be justified in much the same\nway as ordinary first-level plural quantification; and if not, then\nnot. Thus, even if there were no higher-level plural locutions in\nnatural languages, this would provide little or no evidence for the\nstronger — and philosophically more interesting — claim\nthat there can be no iteration of the step from the singular to the\nplural in any language spoken by intelligent agents.\nMoreover, any evidence of this sort could be defeated by pointing to\nindependent reasons why higher-level plural locutions are scarce in\nnatural languages. One such independent reason may simply be that\nordinary speakers aren’t very concerned about their ontological\ncommitments and thus find it more convenient to express facts\ninvolving second-level pluralities by positing objects to represent\nthe first-level pluralities (for instance by talking about two\npairs of shoes) rather than by keeping track of additional\ngrammatical device for second-level plurals (as in the above example\nfrom Icelandic). \nIt is often claimed that the theories PFO and PFO+ qualify as\n“pure logic”. We will refer to this (admittedly vague)\nclaim as the Logicality Thesis. Since the corresponding\nlanguages are interpreted by the translation \\(\\Tr\\) into ordinary\nEnglish, this is a claim about the logicality of certain axioms and\ninferences rules of ordinary\n English.[12] \nEven before the Logicality Thesis is made more precise, it is possible\nto assess its plausibility for at least some of the axioms and\ninference rules of PFO and PFO+. First there are the tautologies and\nthe inference rules governing identity and the singular quantifiers.\nThere is broad consensus that these qualify as logical. Next there are\nthe inference rules governing the plural quantifiers. Since these\nrules are completely analogous to the rules governing the singular\nquantifiers, it can hardly be denied that they too qualify as logical.\nThen there are the extensionality axioms and the axiom that all\npluralities are non-empty. These axioms are unproblematic because they\ncan plausibly be taken to be analytic. What remains are the plural\ncomprehension axioms, where things are much less clear. For these\naxioms have no obvious singular counterparts, and their syntactical\nform indicates that they make existential claims. So it is not obvious\nthat these axioms can be taken to be purely logical. \nThis is not to say that it has not struck people as obvious\nthat the plural comprehension axioms are purely logical. For instance,\nBoolos asserts without argument that the translation of each plural\ncomprehension axiom into English “expresses a logical\ntruth if any sentence of English does” (Boolos 1985b: 342\n[1998a: 167]; his emphasis).  \nIn order to assess the Logicality Thesis in a more principled way,\nmore will have to be said about what it might mean for a theory to be\n“purely logical”. So I will now survey some of the\nfeatures commonly thought to play a role in such a definition.\nAlthough people are free to use the word “logic” as they\nplease, it is important to get clear on what different usages entail;\nin particular, theories that qualify as purely logical are often\nassumed to enjoy a variety of desirable philosophical properties such\nas epistemic and ontological innocence. In the next section, where\nvarious applications of plural quantification will be discussed, I\nwill carefully note which strains of the notion of logicality our\ntheories PFO and PFO+ must possess for the various applications of\nthem to succeed. \nPerhaps the least controversial candidate for a defining feature of\nlogic is its absolute generality. A logical principle is\nvalid in any kind of discourse, no matter what kind of objects this\ndiscourse is concerned with. For instance, modus ponens is valid not\nonly in physics and mathematics but in religion and in the analysis of\nworks of fiction. Frege captures the idea nicely when he says that a\nlogical principle is valid in “the widest domain of all;\n[…] not only the actual, not only the intuitable, but\neverything thinkable” (Frege 1884: 21). Thus, whereas the\nprinciples of physics are valid only in the actual world and in worlds\nthat are nomologically similar to it, the principles of logic govern\neverything thinkable. If one of these principles is denied,\n“complete confusion ensues” (ibid.). \nAnother feature widely believed to be defining of logic is its\nformality: the truth of a principle of logic is guaranteed by\nthe form of thought and/or language and does not in any way\ndepend upon its matter. What this feature amounts to will\nobviously depend on how the distinction between form and matter is\nunderstood. The most popular explication of the distinction between\nform and matter derives from the widely shared view that no objects\nexist by conceptual necessity (Field 1993; Yablo 2000). On this view\nit is natural to regard anything having to do with the existence of\nobjects and with their particular characteristics as belonging to the\nmatter of thought rather than to its form. This gives rise to two\nfeatures that are often regarded as defining of logic. Firstly, logic\nhas to be ontologically innocent; that is, a principle of\nlogic cannot introduce any new ontological commitments (Boolos 1997;\nField 1984). Secondly, the basic notions of logic must not\ndiscriminate between different objects but must treat them all alike.\nThis latter idea is often spelled out as the requirement that logical\nnotions must be invariant under permutations of the domain of objects\n(Tarski 1986). \nA third feature which is often regarded as defining of logic is its\n(alleged) cognitive primacy. Primitive logical notions must\nbe completely understood, and our understanding of them must be direct\nin the sense that it doesn’t depend on or involve an\nunderstanding of notions that must be classified as extra-logical.\nAssume, for instance, that certain set theoretic principles must be\nregarded as extra-logical. Then our understanding of the primitive\nlogical notions cannot depend on or involve any of these\nprinciples. \nI will now outline some applications of the theories PFO and PFO+. In\nthe previous section three strains of the notion of logicality were\ndisentangled. Special attention will be paid to the question which of\nthese three strains PFO and PFO+ must possess for the applications to\nsucceed.  \nAs we saw in\n Section 2.1\n Boolos defined an interpretation of the theory MSO of monadic\nsecond-order logic in the theory PFO of plural quantification. He\nsought to use this translation to establish the logicality of MSO.\nDoing so will require two steps. The first step is to argue that PFO\nis pure logic, that is, to establish the full Logicality Thesis\n(however exactly it is interpreted). The second step is to argue that\nthe interpretation of MSO in PFO preserves logicality. \nSome of the challenges facing the first step will be examined in\n Section 5.\n The second step too should not be underestimated. Perhaps the\ngreatest worry here is that Boolos’s translation renders\nexpressions from one category (that of monadic predicates) in terms of\nexpressions from another category (that of plural noun phrases). For\ninstance, “… is an apple” is rendered as “the\napples”. But these categories are very different\n (Section 2). \nHowever, since the thesis that MSO is pure logic is very abstract,\nmuch of its cash value will lie in its applications. And given the\nequi-interpretability of MSO and PFO, it is likely that many\napplications of the logicality of the former can be served equally\nwell by the logicality of the latter. This reduces somewhat the\nimportance of carrying out the second step. \nBoth Fregean and post-Fregean logicism make essential use of\nsecond-order quantification. Frege defined the various objects of pure\nmathematics as extensions of concepts, and his famous Basic Law V\nstated that two concepts \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) have the same extension just\nin case they are co-extensive: \nBut as is well known, Russell’s paradox shows that the\nsecond-order theory with (V) as an axiom is inconsistent. \nPhilosophers have attempted to rescue some ideas of Fregean logicism\nby using axioms weaker than (V). One of the most important such\nattempts is Bob Hale and Crispin Wright’s neo-logicism,\nwhich gives up Frege’s theory of extensions but holds on to the\ncentral idea of his definition of cardinal numbers, namely that the\nnumber of \\(F\\)s is identical to the number of \\(G\\)s just in case the\n\\(F\\)s and the \\(G\\)s can be one-to-one correlated. This has become\nknown as Hume’s Principle, and can be formalized as \nwhere \\(F\\approx G\\) says there is a relation that one-to-one\ncorrelates the \\(F\\)s and the \\(G\\)s. The second-order theory with\n(HP) as an axiom is consistent and allows us to derive all of ordinary\n(second-order Peano-Dedekind) arithmetic, using some very natural\ndefinitions (see the entry on\n Frege’s Logic, Theorem, and Foundations for Arithmetic). \nEven more modest is Boolos’s sub-logicism, which\nrejects the idea (endorsed by both logicists and neo-logicists) that\nthere are logical objects, but insists that Frege’s definition\nof the ancestral of a relation can be used to show, as\nagainst Kant, that at least some non-trivial mathematics is analytic\n(Boolos 1985b). Recall that a relation \\(R\\) stands to its ancestral\n\\(\\Rarel\\) as the relation is a parent of stands to is an\nancestor of. (More precisely, \\(\\Rarel\\) holds between two\nobjects \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) just in case \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are connected\nthrough a finite sequence of objects each of which bears \\(R\\) to its\nsuccessor.) Frege gives a second-order definition of the ancestral\nrelation \\(\\Rarel\\) by laying down that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are related by\n\\(\\Rarel\\) just in case \\(y\\) has every property that is had by\n\\(x\\)’s \\(R\\)-successors and inherited under the\n\\(R\\)-relation: \nUsing this definition, Frege 1879 proves some non-trivial mathematical\ntruths, such as that the ancestral \\(\\Rarel\\) is transitive and that,\nfor any functional relation \\(R\\), the \\(R\\)-ancestors of any object\nare \\(\\Rarel\\)-comparable (that is, he proved: Functional \\((R) \\amp\nx\\Rarel y \\amp x\\Rarel z \\rightarrow y\\Rarel z \\lor z\\Rarel y\\)). \nIt has been suggested that PFO be used to accommodate the post-Fregean\nlogicists’ need for second-order quantification. Since the\nancestral of a dyadic predicate can be defined using only monadic\nsecond-order quantification, PFO does indeed serve the logical needs\nof Boolos’s\n sub-logicism.[13]\n But since the neo-logicist definition of \\(F\\approx G\\) uses\ndyadic second-order logic, PFO alone does not have sufficient\nexpressive power to accommodate the needs of neo-logicism. The\nneo-logicist may attempt to solve this problem by regarding\nequinumerosity as a primitive logical quantifier or by simulating\ndyadic second-order quantification in some suitable extension of PFO,\nas discussed in\n Section 2.2[14]\n (see Boccuni 2010 for another option). \nWhich strains of the Logicality Thesis are needed for these\napplications to succeed? Since these logicists attempt to show that\nparts of mathematics are analytic (or at least knowable a\npriori), this would require that PFO be analytic (or at least\nknowable a priori), which in turn is likely to require that\nPFO enjoy some form of cognitive primacy. Moreover, PFO would have to\nbe either ontologically innocent or committed only to entities whose\nexistence is conceptually necessary (or at least establishable a\npriori). \nAnother application of the Logicality Thesis is concerned with set\ntheory. One may for a variety of reasons want to talk about and\nquantify over collections of sets (Linnebo 2003: 80–81). For\ninstance, one may want to assert \nIf we formalize this as \nhow is the quantifier \\(\\exists{R}\\) to be understood? It clearly\ncannot be taken to range over all sets, as this would lead straight to\nRussell’s paradox: (13′) would then assert the existence\nof the Russell-set. Three other responses are prominent in the\nliterature. \nThe first response is that \\(\\exists{R}\\) ranges over classes\nbut that some classes are too large (or otherwise unsuited) to be\nsets. In particular,\n (13)\n asserts the existence of the Russell-class, which isn’t a set.\nThis response has been found problematic because it postulates the\nexistence of different kinds of “set-like” entities\n(Boolos 1984: 442 [1998a: 66] and 1998b: 35). It has also been\nobjected that this response only postpones the problem posed by\n (13).\n For it would also be true that \nWhat kind of entity would this collection of classes be? A\nsuper-class? If so, we will be forced to postulate higher and higher\nlevels of classes. Lewis (1991: 68) argues that Russell’s\nparadox is still inescapable because, when we consider all set-like\nentities, we realize that the following is true: \nHowever, Hazen (1993: 141–2) has pointed out that Lewis’s\nobjection violates essential type-restrictions. Classes of different\nlevels belong to different logical types, just as concepts of\ndifferent levels do. So Lewis’s attempt to talk about all\nset-like entities in one fell swoop involves an attempt to quantify\nacross different logical types. But this violates type restrictions in\nthe same way as an attempt to quantify simultaneously over objects and\nconcepts of all different levels. Although we can quantify over\neach level of classes, we can never quantify over all\nlevels simultaneously. \nThe second response is that\n (13)\n asserts the existence of a set \\(R\\), but that \\(R\\) isn’t in\nthe range of the quantifier \\(\\forall{x}\\). This prevents us from\ninstantiating the quantifier \\(\\forall{x}\\) with respect to \\(R\\),\nwhich means that we cannot draw the fatal conclusion that \\(R\\) is a\nmember of itself just in case it isn’t. However, this response\nentails that the quantifier \\(\\forall{x}\\) cannot be chosen to range\nover absolutely all sets; for if it could be so chosen, we would not\nbe able deny that \\(R\\) is in this range of quantification. This means\nthat the universe of sets has a certain inexhaustibility:\nwhenever we have formed a conception of quantification over some range\nof sets, we can define a set which isn’t in this range (Dummett\n1981: ch. 15 and 1991: ch. 24; Glanzberg 2004; Parsons 1977). However,\nthis response has been criticized for being, at best hard to state,\nand at worst self-refuting (Boolos 1998b: 30; Lewis 1991: 68;\nWilliamson 2003: sect. V). (See also Rayo and Uzquiano 2006 for a\nnumber of essays discussing whether absolutely general quantification\nis possible.) \nBecause of the difficulties involved in the first two responses, a\nthird response has become popular in recent years (Boolos 1984 and\n1985a; Burgess 2004; Cartwright 2001; Rayo and Uzquiano 1999; Uzquiano\n2003). This is that the quantifier \\(\\exists{R}\\) is a plural\nquantifier (and would thus be better written as \\(\\exists{rr})\\) and\nthat plural quantification is ontologically innocent. Therefore\n (13)\n does not assert the existence of any “set-like” entity\nover and above the sets in the range of the quantifier \\(\\forall{x}\\).\nBut as we will see in\n Section 5,\n the claim about ontological innocence is controversial. \nSome of the most popular applications of the plural quantification are\nconcerned with ontological economy. The idea is to pay the ontological\nprice of a mere first-order theory and then use plural quantification\nto get for free (a theory with the force of) the corresponding monadic\nsecond-order theory. That would obviously be an ontological bargain.\nApplications of this sort fall into two main classes, which will be\ndiscussed in this sub-section and the next. \nOne class of applications of plural quantification aim to make\nontological bargains in the philosophy of mathematics. In particular,\na number of philosophers have attempted to use plural quantification\nas an ingredient of nominalistic interpretations of mathematics. A\nnice example is Geoffrey Hellman’s modal nominalism, according\nto which mathematical statements committed to the existence of\nabstract objects are to be eliminated in favor of statements about the\npossible existence of concrete objects. For instance, instead\nof claiming, as the platonist does, that there exists an infinite\ncollection of abstract objects satisfying the axioms of Peano\narithmetic (namely the natural numbers), Hellman claims that there\ncould exist an infinite collection of concrete objects\nrelated so as to satisfy these axioms (Hellman 1989 and 1996).\nHowever, even this modal claim appears to talk about\ncollections of concrete objects and relations on\nthese objects. To forestall the objection that this smuggles in\nthrough the back door abstract objects such as sets, Hellman needs\nsome alternative, nominalistically acceptable interpretation of this\ntalk about collections and relations. Plural quantification may offer\nsuch an interpretation. \nFor this application of plural quantification to work, PFO must be\napplicable to all kinds of concrete objects, and it must be\nontologically innocent, or at least not committed to any entities that\nshare those features of abstract objects that are found to be\nnominalistically objectionable. Moreover, in order to simulate\nquantification over relations, we will need not just PFO but a theory\nmore like monadic third-order logic (Sections\n 2.2\n and\n 2.4). \nAnother class of applications attempts to eliminate the commitments of\nscience and common sense to (some or all) complex objects. For\ninstance, instead of employing usual singular quantification over\ntables and chairs, it is proposed that we use plural quantification\nover mereological atoms arranged tablewise or chairwise (Dorr and\nRosen 2002; Hossack 2000; van Inwagen 1990). For instance, instead of\nsaying that there is a chair in one’s office, one should say\nthat there are some atoms in one’s office arranged chairwise. In\nthis way one appears to avoid committing oneself to the existence of a\nchair. Note that such analyses require PFO+, not just PFO, since the\nnew predicates “are arranged \\(F\\)-wise” are\nnon-distributive. \nLet’s set aside purely metaphysical worries about such analyses\nas irrelevant to our present concern. What \\(we\\) would like to know\nis what demands these analyses put on the theory PFO+, in particular,\nwhich strains of the Logicality Thesis are needed. The most obvious\ndemands are that PFO+ be applicable to all kinds of simple objects and\nthat it be ontologically innocent, or at least not committed to\ncomplex objects of the sort to be eliminated. \nA less obvious demand has to do with the need to analyze ordinary\nplural quantification over complex objects, for instance \nWe have already “used up” ordinary plural quantification\nand predication to eliminate apparent commitment to individual chairs\n(Uzquiano 2004). So in order to analyze (16), we will need something\nlike “super-plural” quantification — quantification\nthat stands to ordinary plural quantification as ordinary plural\nquantification stands to singular — and corresponding\nnon-distributive predication. The legitimacy of such linguistic\nresources was discussed in\n Section 2.4. \nThe traditional view in analytic philosophy has been that all plural\nlocutions should be paraphrased away, if need be, by quantifying over\nsets\n (Section 1).\n George Boolos and others objected that it is both unnatural and\nunnecessary to eliminate plural locutions. This led to the theories\nPFO and PFO+. Proponents of plural quantification claim that these\ntheories allow plural locutions to be formalized in a way that is\nfundamentally different from the old set-theoretic paraphrases. In\nparticular, they claim that these theories are ontologically innocent\nin the sense that they introduce no new ontological commitments to\nsets or any other kind of “set-like” entities over and\nabove the individual objects that compose the pluralities in question.\nLet’s call this latter claim Ontological Innocence. \nOther philosophers question Ontological Innocence. For instance,\nMichael Resnik expresses misgivings about the alleged ontological\ninnocence of the plural formalization (\\ref{ex3pprime}) of the\nGeach-Kaplan sentence\n (3).\n For when (\\ref{ex3pprime}) is translated into English as instructed,\nit reads: \nBut \\((3''')\\), Resnik says,  \nseems to me to refer to collections quite explicitly. How else are we\nto understand the phrase “one of them” other than as\nreferring to some collection and as saying that the referent of\n“one” belongs to it? (Resnik 1988: 77)  \nRelated worries have been expressed in Hazen 1993, Linnebo 2003,\nParsons 1990, and Rouilhan 2002; see also Shapiro 1993. \nI will now discuss three arguments in favor of Ontological\nInnocence. \nThe first argument begins by asking us to consider the claim \nand admit that it is true. It continues by arguing that, if plural\nexpressions were committed to collections or any other\n“set-like” objects, then the truth of (17) would lead\nstraight to Russell’s paradox. This is sometimes thought to be a\nknock-down argument in favor of Ontological Innocence (Boolos 1984:\n440–443 [1998a: 64–67]; Lewis 1991: 65–69; McKay\n2006: 31–32). But in fact it is less conclusive than it appears.\nFor as we saw in\n Section 4.3,\n Russell’s paradox will follow only if two alternative views are\nruled out. Since these views cannot be dismissed out of hand, much\nwork remains before this argument can be said to be conclusive. \nThe second argument is nicely encapsulated by Boolos’s remark\nthat “It is haywire to think that when you have some Cheerios,\nyou are eating a set” (1984: 448–9 [1998a: 72]).\nWhat Boolos is suggesting here is that analyses which deny Ontological\nInnocence are likely to get the subject of plural predications\nwrong. \nThe obvious response is to interpret plural predicates in a way which\nensures that what we eat are the elements of a set and not\nthe set itself. Consider the sentence: \nWhen the direct object of the verb “ate” is plural, we can\nfor instance interpret the verb by means of the relation x\nate-the-elements-of y. \nIt will be objected that this response makes the verb\n“ate” ambiguous in an implausible way (Oliver and Smiley\n2001). For when the verb has a direct object that is singular, it will\npresumably be interpreted by means of the ordinary relation x ate\ny. But there is fairly strong evidence that the verb\n“ate” isn’t ambiguous in this way. For instance, one\neffect of an ambiguity is to disallow certain kinds of ellipsis. An\nexample is the ambiguity of “make” in “make\nbreakfast” and “make a plan”, which disallows the\nfollowing ellipsis: \nSo if “ate” was ambiguous in the way just described, the\nfollowing ellipsis would be disallowed as well, which it\nisn’t: \nHowever, it is far from clear that the above response to\nBoolos’s argument needs to be committed to any such problematic\nambiguities. We can for instance let all predicates take\nplural entities as their arguments. The verb “ate” will\nthen always receive as its interpretation the relation\nthe-elements-of x ate-the-elements-of y, thus removing any\nambiguity. Whether or not this response is ultimately acceptable, it\nshows that the argument in question remains inconclusive. \nPerhaps the most popular argument for Ontological Innocence is the one\nto which I now turn. In its simplest form, this argument is based on\nour intuitions about ontological commitments. When you assert\n (18),\n you don’t have the feeling that you are committing yourself\nontologically to a collection or to any other kind of\n“set-like” object. Nor do you have any such feeling when\nyou assert the Geach-Kaplan sentence or any other translation of a\nsentence of PFO or PFO+ into English. Or so the argument goes. \nIn this simple form the argument is vulnerable to the objection that\npeople’s intuitions provide a poor basis for settling\ntheoretical disputes about ontological commitments. We have seen that\nthere are competent speakers of English, such as Michael Resnik, who\ndon’t share these intuitions. Moreover, as Davidson’s\npopular analysis of action sentences in terms of events makes clear,\nordinary people’s intuitions about ontological commitments\ncannot always be trusted (Davidson 1967). For instance, someone may\nsincerely assert that John walked slowly, without being aware that he\nhas committed himself to the existence of an event (namely a walking\nwhich was by John and which was slow). \nAlthough this objection has force, the argument can be sharpened by\nundertaking a more careful study of what forms of existential\ngeneralization are warranted on a sentence containing plural\nexpressions (Boolos 1984: 447 [1998a: 70]; McKay 2006: ch. 2; Yi 2002:\n7–15 and 2005: 469–472). For instance, we may ask whether\nthe following can be inferred from\n (18): \nThis inference would no doubt be quite peculiar. This provides\nevidence that\n (18)\n isn’t committed to any kind of “set-like”\nentity. \nHowever, this evidence is not incontestable. For there are analogous\ninferences that seem quite natural. For instance, from \nmost speakers of English would be perfectly happy to infer that  \nSo perhaps the peculiarity of the inference from\n (18)\n to\n (21)\n is a pragmatic rather than a semantic phenomenon. Perhaps it has to\ndo with the fact that it is less natural to regard some Cheerios as a\nset (or some other sort of plural entity) than it is to regard some\nstudents as a group.  \nHowever, let’s assume that the defenders of the Direct Argument\nare right that\n (18)\n does not entail\n (21).\n What would follow? It would follow that\n (18)\n does not incur any additional ontological commitments of the sort\nthat can be incurred by singular first-order quantifiers. But\nthis conclusion falls short of the argument’s desired conclusion\nthat\n (18)\n does not incur any additional ontological commitments of any\nsort. In order to get from the actual conclusion to the desired\none, we would in addition have to assume that all ontological\ncommitments are of the sort incurred by singular first-order\nquantifiers. But there is an influential philosophical tradition that\ndenies this assumption and instead holds that all kinds of quantifiers\nincur ontological commitments, not just singular first-order\n ones.[15]\n The most famous exponent of this tradition is Frege, who claims that\nsecond-order quantifiers are committed to concepts, just as singular\nfirst-order quantifiers are committed to objects. This tradition ties\nthe notion of ontological commitment very closely to that of a\nsemantic value. This will be the topic of the next and final\nsubsection. \nIn semantics it is widely assumed that each component of a complex\nexpression makes some definite contribution to the meaning of the\ncomplex expression. This contribution is known as the semantic\nvalue of the component expression. It is also assumed that the\nmeaning of the complex expression is functionally determined by the\nsemantic values of the component expressions and their syntactic mode\nof composition. This assumption is known as\ncompositionality. \nAccording to Frege, the semantic value of a sentence is just its\ntruth-value, and the semantic value of a proper name is its referent\n(that is, the object to which it refers). Once we have fixed the\nsemantic values assigned to sentences and proper names, it is easy to\ndetermine what kinds of semantic value to assign to expressions of\nother syntactic categories. For instance, the semantic value of a\nmonadic predicate will have to be a function from objects to\ntruth-values. Frege calls such functions concepts. \nAs an example, let’s consider the simple subject-predicate\nsentence \nThe logical form of (24) is \\(\\mathbf{M}(\\mathbf{s})\\), where\n\\(\\mathbf{M}\\) is the predicate “is mortal” and\n\\(\\mathbf{s}\\) is the singular term “Socrates”.\nLet’s write [\\(\\mathbf{E}\\)] for the semantic value of an\nexpression \\(\\mathbf{E}\\). In accordance with the previous paragraph,\nthe semantic values relevant to (24) are as follows: \nThe truth-value of\n (24)\n is thus determined as \nFrege took the connection between semantic values and ontological\ncommitments to be a very close one. For on the above analysis,\n (24)\n supports two kinds of existential generalizations: not just to\n\\(\\Exists{x}\\mstop\\mathbf{M}(x)\\) (which is true just in case there\nexists some object which is mortal) but also to \\(\\Exists{F}\\mstop\nF(s)\\) (which is true just in case there exists some concept under\nwhich Socrates falls). According to Frege, this shows that sentences\nsuch as\n (24)\n are ontologically committed not just to an object but also to a\nconcept. \nWhat matters for present purposes is not the truth or falsity of\nFrege’s claim about concepts but whether a cogent argument of\nthis sort can be developed for plural expressions. To investigate\nthis, let’s consider a simple non-distributive plural\npredication such as \nThe logical form of (28) appears to be \\(\\mathbf{C}(\\mathbf{aa})\\),\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) is the predicate “form a circle” and\n\\(\\mathbf{aa}\\) is the plural term “these apples”. (If you\nthink complex plural demonstrative have internal semantic structure,\nuse instead some plural name stipulated to refer directly to the\napples in question.) The natural view will then be as follows. \nThe truth-value of\n (28)\n will then be determined as \nwhich is what one would expect, given the syntactic similarity between\n (24)\n and (28). \nAssume that this analysis is correct and that each plural term thus\nhas some objects as its semantic value, just as each singular term has\none object as its semantic value. What will this mean for the question\nof Ontological Innocence? According to the Fregean tradition, which\nconnects the notion of ontological commitment to that of a semantic\nvalue, this will mean that plural expressions incur commitment to\nplural entities, much as predicates incur commitment to concepts. For\nto say that a sentence incurs a commitment to a plural entity is just\nto say that the truth of the sentence requires there to be some\nsemantic value of the sort appropriate to plural expressions. However,\nthis line of reasoning will be resisted by other philosophers, who\nbelieve that the notion of ontological commitment should be tied (at\nmost) to singular first-order variables. \nHow can this disagreement be adjudicated? On the one hand, it may\ncount in favor of the Fregean tradition that their view is highly\nsystematic. There may be something ad hoc about the idea that\nsome sorts of semantic value give rise to ontological commitments\nwhile other sorts don’t. On the other hand, it may count in\nfavor of the alternative view that it does better justice to many\npeople’s strongly felt intuition that plural locutions are\nontologically innocent. \nAnother possibility is that the whole controversy is ultimately just a\npseudo-disagreement (see especially Florio and Linnebo 2016, but also\nParsons 1990; Shapiro 1993; Linnebo 2003; Rayo 2007; and Linnebo and\nRayo 2012). If both parties agree that plural expressions have\nsemantic values, and if both agree that commitments to\nobjects are incurred only by singular first-order terms and\nvariables, then perhaps it does not matter whether other sorts of\nterms and variables should be regarded as introducing their own\ndistinctive kinds of ontological commitment. Some philosophers speak\nabout a theory’s ideological commitments and not just\nabout its ontological commitments. By this is meant the logical and\nconceptual resources that the theory employs. Perhaps philosophers\nwould be well advised to focus more on the metaphysical and\nepistemological questions raised by a theory’s ideological\ncommitments and worry less about whether these ideological commitments\nshould be also regarded as introducing a distinctive kind of\nontological commitment. After all, the notion of an ontological\ncommitment is a theoretical one, not one that has any sharp content\noutside of philosophy. So perhaps we should regard the notion more as\na means to the end of providing good philosophical explanations and\nless as a goal in itself.","contact.mail":"oystein.linnebo@ifikk.uio.no","contact.domain":"ifikk.uio.no"}]
