Feminist\npolitical philosophy is a branch of both feminist philosophy and\npolitical philosophy. As a branch of feminist philosophy, it serves as\na form of critique or a hermeneutics of suspicion (Ricœur\n1970). That is, it serves as a way of opening up or looking at the\npolitical world as it is usually understood and uncovering ways in\nwhich women and their current and historical concerns are poorly\ndepicted, represented, and addressed. As a branch of political\nphilosophy, feminist political philosophy serves as a field for\ndeveloping new ideals, practices, and justifications for how political\ninstitutions and practices should be organized and reconstructed.\n\n\n\nWhile feminist philosophy has been instrumental in critiquing and\nreconstructing many branches of philosophy, from aesthetics to\nphilosophy of science, feminist political philosophy may be the\nparadigmatic branch of feminist philosophy because it best exemplifies\nthe point of feminist theory, which is, to borrow a phrase from Marx,\nnot only to understand the world but to change it (Marx and Engels 1998). And, though other fields have effects that may change the\nworld, feminist political philosophy focuses most directly on\nunderstanding ways in which collective life can be improved. This\nproject involves understanding the ways in which power\nemerges and is used or misused in public life (see the entry on \n feminist perspectives on power).  \n As with other kinds of feminist theory, common themes have emerged for\ndiscussion and critique, but there has been little in the way of\nconsensus among feminist theorists on what is the best way to\nunderstand them.  This introductory article lays out the various\nschools of thought and areas of concern that have occupied this\nvibrant field of philosophy for the past forty years. It understands\nfeminist philosophy broadly to include work conducted by feminist\ntheorists doing this philosophical work from other disciplines,\nespecially political science but also anthropology, comparative\nliterature, law, and other programs in the humanities and social\nsciences.\n\n\n\nCurrent feminist political philosophy is indebted to the work of\nearlier generations of feminist scholarship and activism, including the\nfirst wave of feminism in the English-speaking world, which took place\nfrom the 1840s to the 1920s and focused on improving the political,\neducational, and economic system primarily for middle-class women. Its\ngreatest achievements were to develop a language of equal rights for\nwomen and to garner women the right to vote. It is also indebted to the\nsecond wave of feminism, which, beginning in the 1960s, drew on the\nlanguage of the civil rights movements (e.g., the language of\nliberation) and on a new feminist consciousness that emerged through\nwomen’s solidarity movements and new forms of reflection that\nuncovered sexist attitudes and impediments throughout the whole of\nsociety. By 1970, feminism had expanded from activism to scholarship with\nthe publication of Shulamith Firestone’s The Dialectic of\nSex (Firestone 1971); Kate Millett’s Sexual\nPolitics (Millett 1970); and Robin Morgan’s\nSisterhood is Powerful (Morgan 1970). \n\nOne of the first theoretical advances of second wave feminism was to\nseparate out biological conceptions of women’s identity from\nsocially-constructed ones in order to disprove the notion that biology\nwas destiny and hence that women’s main role was as mothers and\ncaregivers. Drawing on the social sciences and psychoanalytic theory,\nanthropologist Gayle Rubin developed an account of a “sex/gender\nsystem” (Rubin 1975; Dietz 2003, 401; and the entry on \n feminist perspectives on sex and gender). \nThe sex/gender distinction pointed to “a set of arrangements by which\nthe biological raw material of human sex and procreation is shaped by\nhuman, social intervention” (Rubin 1975, 165). While biological sex\nwas fixed, in Rubin’s view, gender was a social construction that\nserved to divide the sexes and privilege men. Because gender was\nmutable, the sex/gender distinction gave feminists a powerful tool to\nlook for ways to address women’s oppression. \n\nWith this socially-constructed notion of gender, early second-wave\ntheorists sought out an understanding of woman as a universal subject\nand agent of feminist politics. \n\nA major set of fault lines in feminist thought since the 1990s is over\nthe questions of the subject of “woman.” According to Mary\nDietz’s 2003 article laying out the field, there are two large groups\nhere.  One champions the category of woman (in the singular and\nuniversal), arguing that the specificity of women’s identity, their\nsexual difference from men, should be appreciated and revalued. (The\nother, discussed below, takes up women’s diversity.) This “difference\nfeminism” includes two distinct groups: (i) those who look at\nhow gendered sexual difference is socially constituted and (ii) those\nwho look at how sexual difference is constructed symbolically and\npsychoanalytically. The first, social difference feminism, includes\ntheories that revalue mothering and caring and has been developed\nlargely in the Anglo-American context. (See for example Tronto 1993\nand Held 1995.) The second, symbolic difference feminism, is that of\nwhat are often referred to as the French Feminists, including\nIrigaray, Cixous, and Kristeva. They belong in this group to the\nextent that they value and distinguish women’s specific sexual\ndifference from men’s. Irigaray’s focus on sexual difference is\nemblematic of this. Social-difference and symbolic-difference\nfeminisms have very little to do with each other but, Dietz argues,\nthey share the notion that a feminist politics requires a\ncategory woman that has a determinate meaning (Dietz 2003,\n403; Nicholson 1994, 100). \nJust as Marxist theory sought out a\nuniversal subject in the person of the worker, feminists theorists\nsought it out in a shared and common condition that afflicted women\nacross cultures. But this notion of a universal womanhood was\ninterrupted by other thinkers, such as bell hooks, saying that it\nexcluded non-white and non-middle-class women’s experience and\nconcerns. Hooks’ 1981 book titled Ain’t I a Woman? exposed\nmainstream feminism as a movement of a small group of middle- and\nupper-class white women whose experience was very particular, hardly\nuniversal. The work of hooks and later Cherrie Moraga, Gloria\nAnzaldúa, Maria Lugones, Elizabeth Spelman, and others\nforegrounded the need to account for women’s multiple and complex\nidentities and experiences. By the 1990s the debates about whether\nthere was a coherent concept of woman that could underlie feminist\npolitics was further challenged by non-Western women challenging the\nWestern women’s movement as caught up in Eurocentric ideals that led\nto the colonization and domination of “Third World”\npeople. What is now known as postcolonial theory further heightened\nthe debate between feminists who wanted to identify a universal feminist\nsubject of woman (e.g. Okin, Nussbaum, and Ackerly) and those who call\nfor recognizing multiplicity, diversity, and intersectionality (e.g.,\nSpivak, Narayan, Mahmood, and Jaggar). \n\nThe effects of this diversity movement would be felt more in the 1990s\nand beyond. In the meantime, in the 1970s and 1980s feminist theory\nbegan to develop in the various areas of the social sciences and\nhumanities, and in philosophy it began to arise in what were already\nthe different traditions and areas of research. As a branch of\npolitical philosophy, feminist political philosophy has often mirrored\nthe various divisions at work in political philosophy more\nbroadly. Prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold\nWar, political philosophy was usually divided into categories such as\nliberal, conservative, socialist, and Marxist.  Except for\nconservatism, for each category there were often feminists working and\ncritiquing alongside it. Hence, as Alison Jaggar’s classic\ntext, Feminist Politics and Human Nature, spelled out, each\nideological approach drew feminist scholars who would both take their\ncue from and borrow the language of a particular ideology (Jaggar\n1983). Jaggar’s text grouped feminist political philosophy into four\ncamps: liberal feminism, socialist feminism, Marxist feminism, and\nradical feminism. The first three groups followed the lines of Cold\nWar global political divisions: American liberalism, European\nsocialism, and a revolutionary communism (though few in the west would\nembrace Soviet-style communism). Radical feminism was the most\nindigenous of the feminist philosophies, developing its own political\nvocabulary with its roots in the deep criticisms of patriarchy that\nfeminist consciousness had produced in its first and second\nwaves. Otherwise, feminist political philosophy largely followed the\nlines of traditional political philosophy. But this has never been an\nuncritical following.  As a field bent on changing the world, even\nliberal feminist theorists tended to criticize liberalism as much or\nmore than they embraced it, and to embrace socialism and other more\nradical points of view more than to reject them. Still, on the whole,\nthese theorists generally operated within the language and framework\nof their chosen approach to political philosophy. \n\nPolitical philosophy began to change enormously in the late 1980s, just\nbefore the end of the Cold War, with a new invocation of an old Hegelian\ncategory: civil society, an arena of political life intermediate\nbetween the state and the household. This was the arena of\nassociations, churches, labor unions, book clubs, choral societies and\nmanifold other nongovernmental yet still public organizations. In the\n1980s political theorists began to turn their focus from the state to\nthis intermediate realm, which suddenly took center stage in Eastern\nEurope in organizations that challenged the power of the state and\nultimately led to the downfall of communist regimes. \n\nAfter the end of the Cold War, political philosophy along with\npolitical life radically realigned. New attention focused on civil\nsociety and the public sphere, especially with the timely translation\nof Jürgen Habermas’s early work, the Structural Transformation\nof the Public Sphere (Habermas 1989). Volumes soon appeared on\ncivil society and the public sphere, focusing on the ways in which\npeople organized themselves and developed public power rather than on\nthe ways that the state garnered and exerted its power. In fact, there\narose a sense that the public sphere ultimately might exert more power\nthan the state, at least in the fundamental way in which public will is\nformed and serves to legitimate—or not—state\npower. In the latter respect, John Rawls’s work was\ninfluential by developing a theory of justice that tied the legitimacy\nof institutions to the normative judgments that a reflective and\ndeliberative people might make (Rawls 1971). By the early 1990s,\nMarxists seemed to have disappeared or at least become very circumspect\n(though the downfall of communist regimes needn’t have had any effect\non Marxist analysis proper, which never subscribed to Leninist or\nMaoist thought). Socialists also retreated or transformed themselves\ninto “radical democrats” (Mouffe 1992, 1993, 2000). \n\nNow the old schema of liberal, radical, socialist, and Marxist\nfeminisms were much less relevant. There were fewer debates about what\nkind of state organization and economic structure would be better for\nwomen and more debates about the value of the private sphere of\nthe household and the nongovernmental space of associations. Along\nwith political philosophy more broadly, more feminist political\nphilosophers began to turn to the meaning and interpretation of civil\nsociety, the public sphere, and democracy itself. \n\nFeminist theorists have also done substantial work in rescuing from obscurity feminist political philosophers who were excluded from the canon and rethinking the canon itself. See the entry on Feminist History of Philosophy.\n \n\nNow in the second decade of the twenty-first century, feminist\ntheorists are doing an extraordinary variety of work on matters\npolitical and democratic, including global ethics, human rights,\ndisabilities studies, bioethics, climate change, and international\ndevelopment. Some\nof the tensions that came to the fore in previous decades are played\nout in any of these areas.  \n\nFor example, in global ethics there is a debate over whether there are\nuniversal values of justice and freedom that should be intentionally\ncultivated for women in the developing world or whether cultural\ndiversity should be prized. Feminist theorists have sought to answer\nthis question in a number of different and compelling ways. (For some\nexamples see Ackerly 2000, Ackerly & Okin 1999, Benhabib 2002 and\n2008, Butler 2000, Gould 2004, and Zerilli 2009.) \n\nLikewise new philosophical work on disabilities, as the entry on\n feminist perspectives on disability\n explains, is\ninformed by a great deal of feminist theory, from standpoint\nphilosophy to feminist phenomenology, as well as political\nphilosophical questions of identity, difference, and diversity. (See\nalso Carlson & Kittay, 2010.) \n\nUltimately, the number of approaches that can be taken on any of these\nissues is as high as the number of philosophers there are working on\nthem. Nonetheless there are some general family resemblances to be\nfound in certain groupings, not altogether unlike Jaggar’s 1983\nclassification. The remainder of this entry will identify how the\nprevious schema has changed and what new constellations have\nemerged. \n\nOf Jaggar’s categories,\n liberal feminism \nremains a strong current in feminist political\nthought. Following liberalism’s focus on freedom and equality, liberal feminism’s primary concern is to protect and enhance women’s\npersonal and political autonomy, the first being the freedom to live\none’s life as one wants and the second being the freedom to help\ndecide the direction of the political community. This approach was\ninvigorated with the publication of John Rawls’s A Theory of\nJustice (Rawls 1971) and subsequently his Political\nLiberalism (Rawls 1993).  Susan Moller Okin (Okin 1989, 1979;\nOkin et al. 1999) and Eva Kittay (Kittay 1999) have used Rawls’s work\nproductively to extend his theory to attend to women’s concerns. \n\nFrom a more critical perspective, several feminist theorists have argued\nthat some of the central categories of liberalism occlude women’s\nlived concerns; for example, the central liberal private/public\ndistinction sequesters the private sphere, and any harm that may occur\nthere to women, away from political scrutiny (Pateman 1983). Perhaps\nmore than any other approach, liberal feminist theory parallels\ndevelopments in liberal feminist activism. While feminist activists\nhave waged legal and political battles to criminalize, as just one\nexample, violence against women (which previously, in marital\nrelations, hadn’t been considered a crime), feminist political\nphilosophers who have engaged the liberal lexicon have shown how the\ndistinction between private and public realms has served to uphold\nmale domination of women by rendering power relations within the\nhousehold as “natural” and immune from political\nregulation. Such political philosophy uncovers how seemingly innocuous\nand “commonsensical” categories have covert power\nagendas. For example, old conceptions of the sanctity of the private\nspace of the household and the role of women primarily as\nchild-bearers and caregivers served to protect male domination of\nwomen in the household from public scrutiny. Feminist critiques of the\npublic/private split supported legal advances that finally led in the\n1980s to the criminalization in the United States of spousal rape\n(Hagan and Sussman 1988). \n\nOther feminist critics note that liberalism continues to treat unproblematically\nmany of the concepts that theorists in the 1990s and since have\nproblematized, such as “woman” as a stable and\nidentifiable category and the unity of the self underlying self-rule\nor autonomy. Critics (such as Zerilli 2009) have argued that the\nuniversal values that liberals such as Okin invoked were really\nexpanded particulars, with liberal theorists mistaking their\nethnocentrically derived values as universal ones. At the same time,\nhowever, some feminist critics are showing how many of the values of\nliberalism could be performatively reconstituted. (See section\n2.7)  \n\nNonetheless there is very important work going on in this field. For\nexample, Carole Pateman and Charles Mills have been working within the\nliberal tradition to show the limits and faults of social contract\ntheory for women and people of color. Their jointly authored book, Contract\n& Domination, levels a devastating critique against systems\nof sexual and racial domination. This work engages and\ncritiques some of the most dominant strains of political philosophy.  Beyond liberal feminism, contemporary feminist philosophers have\nled the way in theorizing and critiquing what is known as\nneoliberalism, especially the ways that neoliberal social and economic\nforces impact the lives of women. On Wendy Brown’s account (2015),\nneoliberalism refers to a set of relations between state, society, and\nsubjects that mimics and reinforces radical free-market ideals in the\neconomy. These forces, Brown argues, undermine liberal democratic\ncitizenship, public institutions, and popular sovereignty. Nancy\nFraser (2013), Jodi Dean (2009), and Judith Butler (2015) join Brown\nin asking whether democracy—or “the demos”—can\nbe sustained under neoliberal conditions of rapidly increasing\neconomic precariousness and diminishing social and political resources\nfor resistance.  \n\nWhile feminist liberalism continues to flourish, the historical\ndevelopments and emerging debates described in the previous sections\nhave eclipsed or deeply transformed Jaggar’s other three categories of\nradical, Marxist, and socialist feminism (Jaggar 1983). Also, the\n“grand narratives” that underlay these views, especially\nthe latter two, have fallen out of favor (Snyder 2008). \n\nThose who work in radical feminism continue to take issue with many of\nthe central tenets of liberal feminism, especially its focus on the\nindividual and the supposedly free choices that individuals can\nmake. Where the liberal sees the potential for freedom, the radical\nfeminist sees structures of domination that are bigger than any\nindividual. Patriarchy itself, according to this view, dominates women\nby positioning them as objects of men’s desire (Welch 2015). Radical\nfeminists remain committed to getting at the root of male domination\nby understanding the source of power differentials, which some radical\nfeminists, including Catharine MacKinnon, trace back to male sexuality\nand the notion that heterosexual intercourse enacts male domination\nover women.  “Women and men are divided by gender, made into the\nsexes as we know them, by the requirements of its dominant form,\nheterosexuality, which institutionalizes male sexual dominance and\nfemale sexual submission. If this is true, sexuality is the linchpin\nof gender inequality” (MacKinnon 1989,113). Radical feminists of\nthe 1980s tended to see power as running one-way, from those with\npower over those who are being oppressed. As Amy Allen puts it,\n“Unlike liberal feminists, who view power as a positive social\nresource that ought to be fairly distributed, and feminist\nphenomenologists, who understand domination in terms of a tension\nbetween transcendence and immanence, radical feminists tend to\nunderstand power in terms of dyadic relations of\ndominance/subordination, often understood on analogy with the\nrelationship between master and slave.” (See the section on \nradical feminist approaches\n in the entry on feminist perspectives on power.)\nUnlike the more reformist politics of liberal feminism, radical\nfeminists of the 1980s largely sought to reject the prevailing order\naltogether, sometimes advocating separatism (Daly 1985, 1990). \nA new generation of radical feminist theorists are renewing the\ntradition, showing how it has respected concerns such as\nintersectionality (Whisnant 2016) and shares some of the commitments\nof the postmodern feminists discussed below, e.g., skepticism about\nany fixed gender identity or gender binaries and a more fluid and\nperformative approach to sexuality and politics (Snyder 2008), as well\nas the ways that power and privilege continue to hold women back\n(Chambers in Garry et al 2017, 656). \n\nThrough much of the twentieth century, many political theorists in\nEurope, the United States, and Latin America drew on socialist and\nMarxist texts to develop theories of social change attentive to issues\nof class relations and exploitation in modern capitalist\neconomies. After learning of the horrors of Stalinism, most Western\nMarxists and socialists were extremely critical of the communist\nsystems in the Soviet Union and later in China. Western, mostly\nanti-communist, Marxist thought flourished in Italy (with Antonio\nGramsci’s work), England (with Stuart Hall and Raymond Williams’\nwork), France (with the Socialisme ou Barbarie group), and\nthe United States (but less so there after McCarthyism, yet renewed\nsomewhat in the 1960s with the New Left). Jaggar’s 1983 book summed up\nwell the way feminists were using socialist and Marxist ideas to\nunderstand the way women were exploited and their laboring and\nreproductive work devalued and unpaid though necessary for capitalism\nto function. In the entry on\n feminist perspectives on class and work,\nthe authors point to much of the work that was going on in this field\nup through the mid-1990s.  But since then, the authors note, various postmodern,\npostcolonial, poststructuralist, and deconstructive theories have\ncriticized the bases for socialist and Marxist thought, including the\n“grand narrative” of economic determinism and the\nreduction of everything to economic and material relations. At the\nsame time, Marxist analyses are important parts of other contemporary\nfeminist philosophers’ work.  (See Dean 2009, Fraser 2009, Spivak\n1988.) So while the categories of socialist and Marxist feminisms are\nless relevant today, many feminist philosophers still take seriously\nthe need to attend to the material conditions of life and engage in\nthe hermeneutics of suspicion that Marxist analysis calls for. This is\nespcially evident in new feminist work in critical theory (See for\nexample Fraser 2009, Allen 2007, McAfee 2008, and Young 2000.)  \n\nWhere liberal feminists prefer to focus on equality, not just between\npeople but between the sexes more generally, radical feminists tend to\nsee sexual difference as something instituted by power. So in a\ncurious way, neither approach, however at odds with each other, takes\nsexual difference seriously. Rather, they see it as an effect of\npower, not something real in its own right. In contrast, the variety\nof theories addressed in this and the next section take seriously the\ncategory of woman and want to develop an ethics and politics upon\nit. The views considered in this section, largely developed from in\nthe Anglo-American context, take their cue from the material and lived\nconditions of women, both as mothers and as subjects, and the politics\nthat these experiences give rise to.  \n\nA prime example is care ethics,\nwhich, originally developed as an alternative to mainstream ethical\ntheory, has been harnessed to counter liberal political theory\n(Gilligan 1982; Held 1995). (See the discussion in the entry\non feminist ethics.)  Drawing on\nfeminist research in moral psychology (Gilligan 1982; Held 1995), this\nfield explores the ways in which the virtues that society and\nmothering cultivate in women can provide an alternative to the\ntraditional emphases in moral and political philosophy on\nuniversality, reason, and justice. Some care ethicists have sought to\ntake the virtues that had long been relegated to the private realm,\nsuch as paying particular attention to those who are vulnerable or\ntaking into consideration circumstances and not just abstract\nprinciples, and use them as well in the public realm. This approach\nhas led to intense debates between liberals who advocated universal\nideals of justice and care ethicists who advocated attention to the\nparticular, to relationships, to care. By the 1990s, however, many care\nethicists had revised their views. Rather than seeing care and justice\nas mutually exclusive alternatives, they began to recognize that\nattention to care should be accompanied by attention to fairness\n(justice) in order to attend to the plight of those with whom we have\nno immediate relation (Koggel 1998). \n\nThe care ethics approach raises the question of whether and, if so,\nhow women-as-care-givers have distinct virtues. Feminists as a whole have long\ndistanced themselves from the idea that women have any particular essence,\nchoosing instead to see femininity and its accompanying virtues as\nsocial constructs, dispositions that result from culture and\nconditioning, certainly not biological givens. So for care ethicists to\nchampion the virtues that have inculcated femininity seems also to\nchampion a patriarchal system that relegates one gender to the role of\ncaretaker. The care ethicists’ answer to this problem has largely been to flip the\nhierarchy, to claim that the work of the household is more meaningful\nand sustaining than the work of the polis. But critics, such as\nDrucilla Cornell, Mary Dietz, and Chantal Mouffe, argue that such a\nrevaluation keeps intact the dichotomy between the private and the\npublic and the old association of women’s work with childcare.\n(Butler and Scott 1992; Phillips and NetLibrary Inc 1998, pp.\n386–389) \nDisregard for the role of emotion in political life has long been\na policy in the history of philosophy, in particular because\nemotionality—like care—is frequently associated with women\nand racialized others. However, women philosophers have insisted on\nthe importance of this intersection (for example Hall 2005, Krause\n2008, and Nussbaum 2015). Building on the contributions of feminist\ncare ethicists and difference feminists who worked to show the\nsignificance of positive affects typically associated with\nfemininity—such as love, interest, and care—in ethical\nencounters (see Held 1995, Tronto 1993), other thinkers worried that\nthis appraisal merely reified a false (gendered) dichotomy between\nreason and emotion, mind and body. Instead, early work by Alison\nJaggar (1990), Elizabeth Spelman (1989 and 1991), Genevieve Lloyd\n(1993), Elizabeth Grosz (1994), and others argued that reason is both\nembodied and emotion-laden, and that emotion is an important resource\nfor epistemology in particular. Building on this work, feminist\npolitical theorists have argued that understanding the role of emotion\nand affect is crucial for understanding a number of important\npolitical phenomena: motivation for action (Krause 2008), collective\naction and community formation (Beltrán 2009 and 2010, Butler\n2004 and 2015), solidarity and patriotism (Nussbaum 2005 and 2015), as\nwell as vulnerability (Fineman 2013), racism and xenophobia (Ahmed\n2015, Anker 2014, Ioanide 2015). Meanwhile, others examine the\npolitical significance of specific emotions, for instance: shame\n(Ahmed 2015), precarity and grief (Butler 2004), anger (Spelman 1989,\nLorde 1984), fear (Anker 2015), and love (Nussbaum 2015).   More recently, many feminist critics have turned their attention\nto how neoliberalism demands resiliency in the face of increasing\nprecarity. Some borrow from Michel Foucault’s late work on\nbiopolitics, examining how neoliberal demands for autonomy,\nself-sufficiency, delf-discipline, and self-investment impact\nindividuals on the level of subjectivity, making both life and the\npossibility of political action to transform the conditions of life\nincreasingly untenable. Individuals, they argue, are met with\nincreasing vulnerability to economic forces and fewer resources to\novercome vulnerability due to social isolation and limited access to\nsocial services (Butler 2015, Povinelli 2011). Some feminists study\nhow subjectivity, affect, and morality accommodate these neoliberal\ntrends. For instance, this shows up in how the demand to\n“overcome vulnerability” via the contemporary emphasis on\nindividual “resilience” attempts to transform vulnerable\npersons, especially women, into productive neoliberal subjects (James\n2015), how productive emotions like “happiness” are\nencouraged and unruly ones like “willfulness” are\ndiscouraged (Berland 2011, Ahmed 2014), or how the targeted discourse\naround “self-care” can contribute to individualist\nconsumer culture that diminishes women’s capacities for collective\naction (Ahmed 2017). Instead, many feminist critiques challenge\nneoliberal individualism by reasserting that agency need not be\nsynonymous with autonomy, and propose nonsovereign or relational\naccounts of the agentic subject instead.   Another group of feminist political theorists who take sexual\ndifference seriously are those who work in the continental traditions,\nespecially poststructuralism, and attend to the ways in which language\nand meaning-systems structure experience. Notable among them are the\nso-called French Feminists, namely Cixous, Kristeva, and Irigaray. Of\nthem all, Irigaray may have the most developed political philosophy,\nincluding several books on the rights that should be afforded to girls\nand women. Irigaray’s early work (1985a and 1985b) made the case that\nin the history of philosophy women have been denied their own essence\nor identity. Rather, they have been positioned as men’s mirror\nnegation.  So that to be a man is to not be a woman, and hence that\nwoman equals only not-man. Her strategy in response to this is to\nspeak back from the margins to which women have been relegated and to\nclaim some kind of “essence” for women, and along with\nthat a set of rights that are specifically for girls and women\n(Irigaray 1994 and 1996). Criticisms of her views have been heated,\nincluding among feminists themselves, especially those who are wary of\nany kind of essentialist and biological conflation of women’s\nidentity. To the extent that Irigaray is an essentialist, her view\nwould indeed be relegated to the approach outlined here as symbolic\ndifference feminism, as Dietz 2003 does. But there are compelling\narguments that Irigaray is wielding essentialism strategically or\nmetaphorically, that she isn’t claiming that women really do have some\nkind of irreducible essence that the history of metaphysics has denied\nthem (Fuss 1989). This other reading would put Irigaray more in the\nperformative group described below.  The same kind of argument could\nbe made for the work of Julia Kristeva, that her metaphors of the\nfemale chora, for example, are describing the western imaginary, not\nany kind of womanly reality. So whether French feminist thought should\nbe grouped as difference feminism or performative feminism is still\nvery much open to debate. \n\nTo the extent that the above two types of feminist theory are\npinpointing some kind of specific difference between the sexes,\nthey raise concerns about essentialism or\nidentifying distinct values that women have as women. Such concerns\nare part of a larger set of criticisms that have run through feminist\ntheorizing since the 1970s, with non-white, non-middle-class, and\nnon-western women questioning the very category of\n“woman” and the notion that this title could be a\nboundary-spanning category that could unite women of various walks of\nlife. (See the entries on\n identity politics and\n feminist perspectives on sex and gender.)\n Criticisms of a unitary identity of\n“woman” have been motivated by worries that much feminist\ntheory has originated from the standpoint of a particular class of\nwomen who mistake their own particular standpoint for a universal\none. In her 1981 book, Ain’t I a Woman?: Black women and\nfeminism, bell hooks notes that the feminist movement pretends to\nspeak for all women but was made up of primarily white, middle class\nwomen who, because of their narrow perspective, did not represent the\nneeds of poor women and women of color and ended up reinforcing class\nstereotypes (hooks 1981). What is so damning about this kind of\ncritique is that it mirrors the one that feminists have leveled\nagainst mainstream political theorists who have taken the particular\ncategory of men to be a universal category of mankind, a schema that\ndoes not in fact include women under the category of mankind but marks\nthem as other (Lloyd 1993). \n\nHence, one of the most vexing issues facing feminist theory in\ngeneral and feminist political philosophy in particular is the matter\nof identity (see the entry on\n  identity politics).\nIdentity politics, itself a politically vexed term, refers to political practices of\nmobilizing for change on the basis of a political identity (women,\nBlack, Chicana, etc.). The philosophical debate is whether such\nidentities are based on some real difference or history of oppression,\nand also whether people should embrace identities that have\nhistorically been used to oppress them. Identity politics in feminist\npractice is fraught along at least two axes: whether there is any real\nessence or identity of woman in general and even if so whether the\ncategory of woman could be used to represent all women. People at the\nintersection of multiple marginalized identities (e.g, Black women) have raised\nquestions about which identity is foremost or whether either identity\nis apt. Such questions play out with the question of \n political representation—what \naspects of identity are politically salient and truly\nrepresentative, whether race, class, or gender (Phillips 1995; Young\n1997, 2000). The ontological question of women’s identity\ngets played out on the political stage when it comes to matters of\npolitical representation, group rights, and affirmative action. The\n2008 U.S. Democratic Party primary battle between Senators Barack Obama\nand Hillary Clinton turned this philosophical question into a very real\nand heated one from Black women throughout the United States. Was a\nBlack woman who supported Clinton a traitor to her race, or a Black\nwoman who supported Obama a traitor to her sex? Or did it make\nany sense to talk about identity in a way that would lead to charges of\ntreason? Of the approaches discussed above, radical and maternal\nfeminism seem particularly wedded to feminist identity politics. \n\nThe other large group of contemporary feminist philosophers that Dietz\n(2003) describes disagrees entirely with the idea that there is or\nneeds to be a single and universal category of “woman.”\nDietz refers to this group as diversity feminism, which began with\nwhat we described earlier: women of color and others pointing out that\nthe presuppositions of mainstream feminism were based on their very\nparticular race and class.  In the 1980s and 1990s philosophy along\nwith the rest of Western culture started grappling with demands for\nmulticultural perspectives. Shortly thereafter postcolonial theory\nraised the need to become aware of multiple global perspectives. As\nSharon Krause describes it, “this development involved the\n‘world diversification’ of feminism to a more global,\ncomparative, and differentiated body of work” (Krause 2011,\n106). This diversification, Krause notes, is also due to new\nliterature on intersectionality, that is, the ways in which\nthe intersections of our multiple identities (race, gender, orientation, ethnicity, etc.)\nall need to be attended to in talking about political change (Krause\n2011, 107). Intersectionality also links up with discussions of\n“hybridity” in postcolonial literature, of religion and\nglobalization, and of the experiences of LGBTQ people. “The\nresult is an explosion of knowledge about the lived experience of\ndifferently placed and multiply-positioned women” (Krause 2011,\n107). \n\nDecolonial feminists overlap in many areas with other women of color\nfeminists, but they bring several unique concerns specific to the\ncolonial and post-colonial experience. In contemporary decolonial\ntheory, these concerns are largely framed within the discourse of\n“coloniality,” first theorized in terms of “coloniality of power” by\nAnibal Quijano (Quijano 2003). Here, “coloniality” refers to how\nrelations between colonizer and colonized are racialized, for instance\nhow labor, subjectivity, and authority are racialized around the\ncolonial system of capitalist exploitation. (For more on\n“coloniality,” see Lugones 2010, Mignolo 2000, Maldonado Torres 2008,\nWynter 2003.) For feminist thinkers like María Lugones (2007, 2010),\ngender is another axis around which the global capitalist system of\npower classifies and dehumanizes people. For Lugones and others,\nincluding Oyeronke Oyewumi (1997), gender is a colonial imposition in\ntension with non-modern cosmologies, economies, and modes of\nkinship. Lugones calls this the “coloniality of gender,” noting that\nde-colonizing gender is part of a wider project of decolonial\nresistance opposed to the categorial, dichotomous, and hierarchical\nlogics of capitalist modernity that are rooted in the colonization of\nthe Americas.  \nIn feminist decolonial literature, resistance is often discussed in\nterms of the coloniality of gender (Lugones 2003, 2007, 2010; Oyewumi\n1997, 2004); language (Spivak 2010); identity and subjectivity – for\ninstance, accounts of hybridity, multiplicity, and mestizaje\n(Anzaldúa 1987, Ortega 2016, Moraga and Anzaldúa 2015); and\n“world-traveling” (Lugones 1995, Ortega 2016). Many of these same\nthinkers argue that feminism itself must be decolonized, critiquing\nfeminist universalisms that claim to account for the complex\nintersections of sexuality, race, gender, and class (see Mohanty 2003,\nLugones 2010).\n  Instersectionality, which is in part a theory of power, grew out\nof groundbreaking works by Black feminist theorists such as\nKimberlé Crenshaw’s “Demarginalizing the Intersection of\nRace and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination\nDoctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Practice” (Crenshaw\n1989), Patricia Hill Collins’s book Black Feminist Thought:\nKnowledge, Consciousness and the Politics of Empowerment (Collins\n1990), Angela Davis’s Women, Race, and Class (Davis 1981),\nand Patricia Williams’s The Alchemy of Race and Rights\n(Williams 1992). The impact of this work was felt strongly where it\noriginated in feminist legal theory (see\n feminist philosophy of law), and has\ncontinued to be an important concept for theories of power and\noppression in and out of feminist political philosophy. (See also the\nsection on intersectionality in\nthe  entry on\n discrimination.)  \n\nIf the diversity feminists, from multiculuturalists to postcolonial\nand intersectional thinkers, are right, then there is no reliable\ncategory of woman on which to base feminist politics.  By the end of\nthe 1990s some saw this as a radical danger of relativism, and the\nfield seemed to be at an impasse. But then another approach began to\nemerge. As Mary Dietz writes in her 2003 essay on current\ncontroversies in feminist theory, \n\nFollowing up on what has happened in feminist political theory since\nDietz’s article, Sharon Krause writes that this work is\n“contesting the old assumption that agency equals\nautonomy” and makes room “within agency for forms of\nsubjectivity and action that are nonsovereign but nevertheless\npotent” (Krause 2011, citing Allen 2007,\nBeltrán 2010, Butler 2004, Hirschman 2002, and Zerilli 2005.)\n“For some theorists,” Krause writes, “this shift\ninvolves thinking of agency and freedom in more collective ways, which\nemphasize solidarity, relationality, and constitutive\nintersubjectivity” (Krause 2011, 108, citing Butler 2004,\nCornell 2007, Mohanty 2003, and Nedelsky 2005). \n\nThis constellation of thinkers could be working in what we could call\nperformative political philosophy, performative in several senses: in\ntheorizing how agency is constituted, how political judgments can be\nmade in the absence of known rules (Honig 2009, 309), how new\nuniversals can be created and new communities constituted.\nPerformative feminist politics doesn’t worry about whether it is\npossible to come up with a single definition of “woman” or\nany other political identity; it sees identity as something that is\nperformatively created. “How we assume these identitites,”\nDrucilla Cornell writes, “is never something ‘out\nthere’ that effectively determines who we can be as men and\nwomen—gay, lesbian, straight, queer, transsexual, transgender,\nor otherwise” (Cornell 2003, 144). It is something that is\nshaped as we live and externalize identities. From a performative\nfeminist perspective, feminism is a project of anticipating and\ncreating better political futures in the absence of foundations. As\nLinda Zerilli writes, “politics is about making claims and\njudgments—and having the courage to do so—in the absence\nof the objective criteria or rules that could provide certain\nknowledge and the guarantee that speaking in women’s name will be\naccepted or taken up by others” (Zerilli 2005, 179). Drawing\nlargely on Arendt and Butler, Zerilli calls for a\n“freedom-centered feminism” that “would strive to\nbring about transformation in normative conceptions of gender without\nreturning to the classical notion of freedom as sovereignty”\nthat feminists have long criticized but found difficult to resist\n(ibid.). \n\nIn its feminist incarnations, this view also takes its cue from\nJudith Butler’s performative account of gender as well as Hannah\nArendt’s observation that human rights are created politically, as well\nas other thinkers’ ideas, to describe an anticipatory ideal of\npolitics. Linda Zerilli describes this kind of feminist politics as\n“the contingently based public practice of soliciting the\nagreement of others to what each of us claims to be\nuniversal” (Zerilli 2005, p. 173). From a performatve\nperspective, normative political claims appeal to other people, not to\nsupposed truths or foundations. \n\nThis view recuperates many of the ideals of the\nEnlightenment—such as freedom, autonomy, and justice—but in\na way that drops the Enlightenment’s metaphysical assumptions\nabout reason, progress, and human nature. Instead of seeing these\nideals as grounded in some metaphysical facts, this new view sees them\nas ideals that people hold and try to instantiate through practice and\nimagination. Where many ancient and modern ideals of politics were\nbased on suppositions about the nature of reality or of human beings,\ncontemporary political philosophies generally operate without\nsupposing that there are any universal or eternal truths. Some might\nsee this situation as ripe for nihilism, arbitrariness, or the exercise\nof brute power. The performative alternative is to imagine and try to\ncreate a better world by anticipating, claiming, and appealing to\nothers that it should be so. Even if there is no metaphysical\ntruth that human beings have dignity and infinite worth, people can act\nas if it were true in order to create a world in which it is seen to be\nso. \n\nPeformative feminist political philosophy shares liberal feminism’s\nappreciation for Enlightenment ideals but in a way that is skeptical\nabout foundations. Just as Zerilli performatively reconstitutes the\nconcept of freedom, Drucilla Cornell recuperates ideas of autonomy,\ndignity, and personhood, in a new performative capacity, as ideals\nthat people aspire to rather than as moral facts waiting to be\ndiscovered, applied, or realized. \n\nDespite the shared post-foundational theorizing among performative\nfeminists, when it comes to thinking about democratic politics, there\nare sharp divergences, namely on the question of “what it means\nto actualize public spaces and enact democratic politics” (Dietz\n2003, 419). On this questions, theorists tend to diverge into two\ngroups: associational and agonistic.  Associational theorists (e.g.,\nBenhabib 1992, 1996; Benhabib and Cornell 1987; Fraser 1989; Young\n1990, 1997, 2000) gravitate more toward deliberative democratic\ntheory, while agonistic theorists (e.g., Mouffe 1992, 1993, 1999,\n2000; Honig 1995; Ziarek 2001) worry that democratic theories that\nfocus on consensus can silence debate and thus they focus more on\nplurality, dissensus, and the ceaseless contestation within\npolitics. \n\nThe differences spring from, or perhaps lead to, different readings of\nthe philosopher who has most inspired performative political theory:\nHannah Arendt, namely Arendt’s ideas of speech and action in the\npublic sphere, of the meaning of plurality, of the ways in which human\nbeings can distinguish themselves. As Bonnie Honig, a champion of the\nagonistic model writes, Associational theorists tend to look for ways, amidst all the\ndifferences and questions about the lack of foundations, it is\npossible to come to agreement on matters of common concern. This is\nseen in feminist democratic theory, perhaps best known through the\nworks of Seyla Benhabib (Benhabib 1992, 1996), greatly inspired by her\nnon-agonistic reading of Arendt and of the work of the German critical\ntheorist, Jürgen Habermas. Benhabib’s work engages democratic\ntheorists quite broadly, not just feminist theorists. This passage of\nhers helps to clarify what she takes to be the best aim of a political\nphilosophy: a state of affairs to which all affected would assent. As\nshe writes, \n\nFollowing Habermas, Benhabib contends that certain conditions need to\nbe in place in order for members of a political community to arrive at\ndemocratic outcomes, namely the proceedings need to be\ndeliberative. Some take deliberation to be a matter of reasoned\nargumentation; others see it as less about reason or argumentation but\nmore about an open process of working through choices. (McAfee\n2004.) \n\nNot all theorists who tend toward the associational model embrace\ndeliberative theory so readily. Iris Young’s pioneering\nbook, Justice and the Politics of Difference and several of\nher subsequent works have been very influential and have led to a good\ndeal of hesitance in feminist theoretical communities about the claims\nof deliberative theory. Where Benhabib is confident that conditions\ncan be such that all who are affected can have a voice in\ndeliberations, Young points out that those who have been historically\nsilenced have a difficult time having their views heard or\nheeded. Young is skeptical of the claims of mainstream democratic\ntheory that democratic deliberative processes could lead to outcomes\nthat would be acceptable to all (Young 1990, 1997). Young, along with\nNancy Fraser (Fraser 1989) and others, worried that in the process of\ntrying to reach consensus, the untrained voices of women and others\nwho have been marginalized would be left out of the final\ntally. Young’s criticisms were very persuasive, leading a\ngeneration of feminist political philosophers to be wary of\ndeliberative democratic theory. Instead of deliberative democracy, in\nthe mid 1990s Young proposed a theory of communicative democracy,\nhoping to make way for a deliberative conception that was open to\nmeans of expression beyond the rational expression of mainstream\ndeliberative democratic theory. Young worried that deliberation as\ndefined by Habermas is too reason-based and leaves out forms of\ncommunication that women and people of color tend to use, including,\nas she puts it, “greeting, rhetoric, and\nstorytelling”. Young argued that these alternative modes of\ncommunication could provide the basis of a more democratic,\ncommunicative theory. In her last major book, Inclusion and\nDemocracy (Young 2000), Young had clearly moved to\nembrace deliberative theory itself, seeing the ways in which it could\nbe constructed to give voice to those who had been otherwise\nmarginalized. More recent feminist democratic theory has engaged\ndeliberative theory more positively. (See McAfee and Snyder 2007.) \n\nWhere liberal feminists inspired by John Rawls and democratic feminists\ninspired by \n Jürgen Habermas\nand/or \n John Dewey\n\nhold out the hope that democratic deliberations might lead to\ndemocratic agreements, agonistic feminists are wary of consensus as\ninherently undemocratic. Agonistic feminist political philosophy comes\nout of poststructural continental feminist and philosophical\ntraditions. It takes from Marxism the hope for a more radically\negalitarian society. It takes from contemporary continental philosophy\nnotions of subjectivity and solidarity as malleable and\nconstructed. Along with postmodern thought, it repudiates any notion\nof pre-existing moral or political truths or foundations (Ziarek\n2001). Its central claim is that feminist struggle, like other\nstruggles for social justice, is engaged in politics as ceaseless\ncontestation. Agonistic views see the nature of politics as inherently\nconflictual, with battles over power and hegemony being the central\ntasks of democratic struggle.  Advocates of agonistic politics worry\nthat the kind of consensus sought by democratic theorists (discussed\nabove) will lead to some kind of oppression or injustice by silencing\nnew struggles. As Chantal Mouffe puts it, “We have to accept\nthat every consensus exists as a temporary result of a provisional\nhegemony, as a stabilization of power, and that it always entails some\nform of exclusion” (Mouffe 2000, 104). \n\nWhere associational theorists seek out ways that people can overcome\nsystematically distorted communication and deliberation, Dietz notes\nthat agonists eschew this project because they understand politics as\n“essentially a practice of creation, reproduction,\ntransformation and articulation.... Simply put, associational\nfeminists scrutinize the conditions of exclusion in order to theorize\nthe emancipation of the subject in the public sphere of communicative\ninteraction; agonistic feminists deconstruct emancipatory procedures\nto disclose how the subject is both produced through political\nexclusions and positioned against them” (Dietz 2003, 422). \n\nNew work in democratic theory and new readings of Arendt’s philosophy\noffer hope of moving beyond the associational/agonistic divide in\nperformative feminist politics (Barker et al. 2012). Benhabib’s\nproceduralism is being surpassed with more affect-laden accounts of\ndeliberation (Krause 2008; Howard 2017). Instead of the rational back-and-forth of\nreasoned argumentation, theorists are beginning to see deliberative\ntalk as forms of constituting the subject, judging without pre-conceived truths,\nand performatively creating new political projects. \n\nIn sum, feminist political philosophy is a still evolving field of\nthought that has much to offer mainstream political philosophy. In the\npast two decades it has come to exert a stronger influence over\nmainstream political theorizing, raising objections that mainstream\nphilosophers have had to address, though not always very convincingly.\nAnd in its newest developments it promises to go even further.","contact.mail":"noelle.c.mcafee@emory.edu","contact.domain":"emory.edu"},{"date.published":"2009-03-01","date.changed":"2018-10-12","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-political/","author1":"Noëlle McAfee","author2":"Katie B.

Feminist\npolitical philosophy is a branch of both feminist philosophy and\npolitical philosophy. As a branch of feminist philosophy, it serves as\na form of critique or a hermeneutics of suspicion (Ricœur\n1970). That is, it serves as a way of opening up or looking at the\npolitical world as it is usually understood and uncovering ways in\nwhich women and their current and historical concerns are poorly\ndepicted, represented, and addressed. As a branch of political\nphilosophy, feminist political philosophy serves as a field for\ndeveloping new ideals, practices, and justifications for how political\ninstitutions and practices should be organized and reconstructed.\n\n\n\nWhile feminist philosophy has been instrumental in critiquing and\nreconstructing many branches of philosophy, from aesthetics to\nphilosophy of science, feminist political philosophy may be the\nparadigmatic branch of feminist philosophy because it best exemplifies\nthe point of feminist theory, which is, to borrow a phrase from Marx,\nnot only to understand the world but to change it (Marx and Engels 1998). And, though other fields have effects that may change the\nworld, feminist political philosophy focuses most directly on\nunderstanding ways in which collective life can be improved. This\nproject involves understanding the ways in which power\nemerges and is used or misused in public life (see the entry on \n feminist perspectives on power).  \n As with other kinds of feminist theory, common themes have emerged for\ndiscussion and critique, but there has been little in the way of\nconsensus among feminist theorists on what is the best way to\nunderstand them.  This introductory article lays out the various\nschools of thought and areas of concern that have occupied this\nvibrant field of philosophy for the past forty years. It understands\nfeminist philosophy broadly to include work conducted by feminist\ntheorists doing this philosophical work from other disciplines,\nespecially political science but also anthropology, comparative\nliterature, law, and other programs in the humanities and social\nsciences.\n\n\n\nCurrent feminist political philosophy is indebted to the work of\nearlier generations of feminist scholarship and activism, including the\nfirst wave of feminism in the English-speaking world, which took place\nfrom the 1840s to the 1920s and focused on improving the political,\neducational, and economic system primarily for middle-class women. Its\ngreatest achievements were to develop a language of equal rights for\nwomen and to garner women the right to vote. It is also indebted to the\nsecond wave of feminism, which, beginning in the 1960s, drew on the\nlanguage of the civil rights movements (e.g., the language of\nliberation) and on a new feminist consciousness that emerged through\nwomen’s solidarity movements and new forms of reflection that\nuncovered sexist attitudes and impediments throughout the whole of\nsociety. By 1970, feminism had expanded from activism to scholarship with\nthe publication of Shulamith Firestone’s The Dialectic of\nSex (Firestone 1971); Kate Millett’s Sexual\nPolitics (Millett 1970); and Robin Morgan’s\nSisterhood is Powerful (Morgan 1970). \n\nOne of the first theoretical advances of second wave feminism was to\nseparate out biological conceptions of women’s identity from\nsocially-constructed ones in order to disprove the notion that biology\nwas destiny and hence that women’s main role was as mothers and\ncaregivers. Drawing on the social sciences and psychoanalytic theory,\nanthropologist Gayle Rubin developed an account of a “sex/gender\nsystem” (Rubin 1975; Dietz 2003, 401; and the entry on \n feminist perspectives on sex and gender). \nThe sex/gender distinction pointed to “a set of arrangements by which\nthe biological raw material of human sex and procreation is shaped by\nhuman, social intervention” (Rubin 1975, 165). While biological sex\nwas fixed, in Rubin’s view, gender was a social construction that\nserved to divide the sexes and privilege men. Because gender was\nmutable, the sex/gender distinction gave feminists a powerful tool to\nlook for ways to address women’s oppression. \n\nWith this socially-constructed notion of gender, early second-wave\ntheorists sought out an understanding of woman as a universal subject\nand agent of feminist politics. \n\nA major set of fault lines in feminist thought since the 1990s is over\nthe questions of the subject of “woman.” According to Mary\nDietz’s 2003 article laying out the field, there are two large groups\nhere.  One champions the category of woman (in the singular and\nuniversal), arguing that the specificity of women’s identity, their\nsexual difference from men, should be appreciated and revalued. (The\nother, discussed below, takes up women’s diversity.) This “difference\nfeminism” includes two distinct groups: (i) those who look at\nhow gendered sexual difference is socially constituted and (ii) those\nwho look at how sexual difference is constructed symbolically and\npsychoanalytically. The first, social difference feminism, includes\ntheories that revalue mothering and caring and has been developed\nlargely in the Anglo-American context. (See for example Tronto 1993\nand Held 1995.) The second, symbolic difference feminism, is that of\nwhat are often referred to as the French Feminists, including\nIrigaray, Cixous, and Kristeva. They belong in this group to the\nextent that they value and distinguish women’s specific sexual\ndifference from men’s. Irigaray’s focus on sexual difference is\nemblematic of this. Social-difference and symbolic-difference\nfeminisms have very little to do with each other but, Dietz argues,\nthey share the notion that a feminist politics requires a\ncategory woman that has a determinate meaning (Dietz 2003,\n403; Nicholson 1994, 100). \nJust as Marxist theory sought out a\nuniversal subject in the person of the worker, feminists theorists\nsought it out in a shared and common condition that afflicted women\nacross cultures. But this notion of a universal womanhood was\ninterrupted by other thinkers, such as bell hooks, saying that it\nexcluded non-white and non-middle-class women’s experience and\nconcerns. Hooks’ 1981 book titled Ain’t I a Woman? exposed\nmainstream feminism as a movement of a small group of middle- and\nupper-class white women whose experience was very particular, hardly\nuniversal. The work of hooks and later Cherrie Moraga, Gloria\nAnzaldúa, Maria Lugones, Elizabeth Spelman, and others\nforegrounded the need to account for women’s multiple and complex\nidentities and experiences. By the 1990s the debates about whether\nthere was a coherent concept of woman that could underlie feminist\npolitics was further challenged by non-Western women challenging the\nWestern women’s movement as caught up in Eurocentric ideals that led\nto the colonization and domination of “Third World”\npeople. What is now known as postcolonial theory further heightened\nthe debate between feminists who wanted to identify a universal feminist\nsubject of woman (e.g. Okin, Nussbaum, and Ackerly) and those who call\nfor recognizing multiplicity, diversity, and intersectionality (e.g.,\nSpivak, Narayan, Mahmood, and Jaggar). \n\nThe effects of this diversity movement would be felt more in the 1990s\nand beyond. In the meantime, in the 1970s and 1980s feminist theory\nbegan to develop in the various areas of the social sciences and\nhumanities, and in philosophy it began to arise in what were already\nthe different traditions and areas of research. As a branch of\npolitical philosophy, feminist political philosophy has often mirrored\nthe various divisions at work in political philosophy more\nbroadly. Prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold\nWar, political philosophy was usually divided into categories such as\nliberal, conservative, socialist, and Marxist.  Except for\nconservatism, for each category there were often feminists working and\ncritiquing alongside it. Hence, as Alison Jaggar’s classic\ntext, Feminist Politics and Human Nature, spelled out, each\nideological approach drew feminist scholars who would both take their\ncue from and borrow the language of a particular ideology (Jaggar\n1983). Jaggar’s text grouped feminist political philosophy into four\ncamps: liberal feminism, socialist feminism, Marxist feminism, and\nradical feminism. The first three groups followed the lines of Cold\nWar global political divisions: American liberalism, European\nsocialism, and a revolutionary communism (though few in the west would\nembrace Soviet-style communism). Radical feminism was the most\nindigenous of the feminist philosophies, developing its own political\nvocabulary with its roots in the deep criticisms of patriarchy that\nfeminist consciousness had produced in its first and second\nwaves. Otherwise, feminist political philosophy largely followed the\nlines of traditional political philosophy. But this has never been an\nuncritical following.  As a field bent on changing the world, even\nliberal feminist theorists tended to criticize liberalism as much or\nmore than they embraced it, and to embrace socialism and other more\nradical points of view more than to reject them. Still, on the whole,\nthese theorists generally operated within the language and framework\nof their chosen approach to political philosophy. \n\nPolitical philosophy began to change enormously in the late 1980s, just\nbefore the end of the Cold War, with a new invocation of an old Hegelian\ncategory: civil society, an arena of political life intermediate\nbetween the state and the household. This was the arena of\nassociations, churches, labor unions, book clubs, choral societies and\nmanifold other nongovernmental yet still public organizations. In the\n1980s political theorists began to turn their focus from the state to\nthis intermediate realm, which suddenly took center stage in Eastern\nEurope in organizations that challenged the power of the state and\nultimately led to the downfall of communist regimes. \n\nAfter the end of the Cold War, political philosophy along with\npolitical life radically realigned. New attention focused on civil\nsociety and the public sphere, especially with the timely translation\nof Jürgen Habermas’s early work, the Structural Transformation\nof the Public Sphere (Habermas 1989). Volumes soon appeared on\ncivil society and the public sphere, focusing on the ways in which\npeople organized themselves and developed public power rather than on\nthe ways that the state garnered and exerted its power. In fact, there\narose a sense that the public sphere ultimately might exert more power\nthan the state, at least in the fundamental way in which public will is\nformed and serves to legitimate—or not—state\npower. In the latter respect, John Rawls’s work was\ninfluential by developing a theory of justice that tied the legitimacy\nof institutions to the normative judgments that a reflective and\ndeliberative people might make (Rawls 1971). By the early 1990s,\nMarxists seemed to have disappeared or at least become very circumspect\n(though the downfall of communist regimes needn’t have had any effect\non Marxist analysis proper, which never subscribed to Leninist or\nMaoist thought). Socialists also retreated or transformed themselves\ninto “radical democrats” (Mouffe 1992, 1993, 2000). \n\nNow the old schema of liberal, radical, socialist, and Marxist\nfeminisms were much less relevant. There were fewer debates about what\nkind of state organization and economic structure would be better for\nwomen and more debates about the value of the private sphere of\nthe household and the nongovernmental space of associations. Along\nwith political philosophy more broadly, more feminist political\nphilosophers began to turn to the meaning and interpretation of civil\nsociety, the public sphere, and democracy itself. \n\nFeminist theorists have also done substantial work in rescuing from obscurity feminist political philosophers who were excluded from the canon and rethinking the canon itself. See the entry on Feminist History of Philosophy.\n \n\nNow in the second decade of the twenty-first century, feminist\ntheorists are doing an extraordinary variety of work on matters\npolitical and democratic, including global ethics, human rights,\ndisabilities studies, bioethics, climate change, and international\ndevelopment. Some\nof the tensions that came to the fore in previous decades are played\nout in any of these areas.  \n\nFor example, in global ethics there is a debate over whether there are\nuniversal values of justice and freedom that should be intentionally\ncultivated for women in the developing world or whether cultural\ndiversity should be prized. Feminist theorists have sought to answer\nthis question in a number of different and compelling ways. (For some\nexamples see Ackerly 2000, Ackerly & Okin 1999, Benhabib 2002 and\n2008, Butler 2000, Gould 2004, and Zerilli 2009.) \n\nLikewise new philosophical work on disabilities, as the entry on\n feminist perspectives on disability\n explains, is\ninformed by a great deal of feminist theory, from standpoint\nphilosophy to feminist phenomenology, as well as political\nphilosophical questions of identity, difference, and diversity. (See\nalso Carlson & Kittay, 2010.) \n\nUltimately, the number of approaches that can be taken on any of these\nissues is as high as the number of philosophers there are working on\nthem. Nonetheless there are some general family resemblances to be\nfound in certain groupings, not altogether unlike Jaggar’s 1983\nclassification. The remainder of this entry will identify how the\nprevious schema has changed and what new constellations have\nemerged. \n\nOf Jaggar’s categories,\n liberal feminism \nremains a strong current in feminist political\nthought. Following liberalism’s focus on freedom and equality, liberal feminism’s primary concern is to protect and enhance women’s\npersonal and political autonomy, the first being the freedom to live\none’s life as one wants and the second being the freedom to help\ndecide the direction of the political community. This approach was\ninvigorated with the publication of John Rawls’s A Theory of\nJustice (Rawls 1971) and subsequently his Political\nLiberalism (Rawls 1993).  Susan Moller Okin (Okin 1989, 1979;\nOkin et al. 1999) and Eva Kittay (Kittay 1999) have used Rawls’s work\nproductively to extend his theory to attend to women’s concerns. \n\nFrom a more critical perspective, several feminist theorists have argued\nthat some of the central categories of liberalism occlude women’s\nlived concerns; for example, the central liberal private/public\ndistinction sequesters the private sphere, and any harm that may occur\nthere to women, away from political scrutiny (Pateman 1983). Perhaps\nmore than any other approach, liberal feminist theory parallels\ndevelopments in liberal feminist activism. While feminist activists\nhave waged legal and political battles to criminalize, as just one\nexample, violence against women (which previously, in marital\nrelations, hadn’t been considered a crime), feminist political\nphilosophers who have engaged the liberal lexicon have shown how the\ndistinction between private and public realms has served to uphold\nmale domination of women by rendering power relations within the\nhousehold as “natural” and immune from political\nregulation. Such political philosophy uncovers how seemingly innocuous\nand “commonsensical” categories have covert power\nagendas. For example, old conceptions of the sanctity of the private\nspace of the household and the role of women primarily as\nchild-bearers and caregivers served to protect male domination of\nwomen in the household from public scrutiny. Feminist critiques of the\npublic/private split supported legal advances that finally led in the\n1980s to the criminalization in the United States of spousal rape\n(Hagan and Sussman 1988). \n\nOther feminist critics note that liberalism continues to treat unproblematically\nmany of the concepts that theorists in the 1990s and since have\nproblematized, such as “woman” as a stable and\nidentifiable category and the unity of the self underlying self-rule\nor autonomy. Critics (such as Zerilli 2009) have argued that the\nuniversal values that liberals such as Okin invoked were really\nexpanded particulars, with liberal theorists mistaking their\nethnocentrically derived values as universal ones. At the same time,\nhowever, some feminist critics are showing how many of the values of\nliberalism could be performatively reconstituted. (See section\n2.7)  \n\nNonetheless there is very important work going on in this field. For\nexample, Carole Pateman and Charles Mills have been working within the\nliberal tradition to show the limits and faults of social contract\ntheory for women and people of color. Their jointly authored book, Contract\n& Domination, levels a devastating critique against systems\nof sexual and racial domination. This work engages and\ncritiques some of the most dominant strains of political philosophy.  Beyond liberal feminism, contemporary feminist philosophers have\nled the way in theorizing and critiquing what is known as\nneoliberalism, especially the ways that neoliberal social and economic\nforces impact the lives of women. On Wendy Brown’s account (2015),\nneoliberalism refers to a set of relations between state, society, and\nsubjects that mimics and reinforces radical free-market ideals in the\neconomy. These forces, Brown argues, undermine liberal democratic\ncitizenship, public institutions, and popular sovereignty. Nancy\nFraser (2013), Jodi Dean (2009), and Judith Butler (2015) join Brown\nin asking whether democracy—or “the demos”—can\nbe sustained under neoliberal conditions of rapidly increasing\neconomic precariousness and diminishing social and political resources\nfor resistance.  \n\nWhile feminist liberalism continues to flourish, the historical\ndevelopments and emerging debates described in the previous sections\nhave eclipsed or deeply transformed Jaggar’s other three categories of\nradical, Marxist, and socialist feminism (Jaggar 1983). Also, the\n“grand narratives” that underlay these views, especially\nthe latter two, have fallen out of favor (Snyder 2008). \n\nThose who work in radical feminism continue to take issue with many of\nthe central tenets of liberal feminism, especially its focus on the\nindividual and the supposedly free choices that individuals can\nmake. Where the liberal sees the potential for freedom, the radical\nfeminist sees structures of domination that are bigger than any\nindividual. Patriarchy itself, according to this view, dominates women\nby positioning them as objects of men’s desire (Welch 2015). Radical\nfeminists remain committed to getting at the root of male domination\nby understanding the source of power differentials, which some radical\nfeminists, including Catharine MacKinnon, trace back to male sexuality\nand the notion that heterosexual intercourse enacts male domination\nover women.  “Women and men are divided by gender, made into the\nsexes as we know them, by the requirements of its dominant form,\nheterosexuality, which institutionalizes male sexual dominance and\nfemale sexual submission. If this is true, sexuality is the linchpin\nof gender inequality” (MacKinnon 1989,113). Radical feminists of\nthe 1980s tended to see power as running one-way, from those with\npower over those who are being oppressed. As Amy Allen puts it,\n“Unlike liberal feminists, who view power as a positive social\nresource that ought to be fairly distributed, and feminist\nphenomenologists, who understand domination in terms of a tension\nbetween transcendence and immanence, radical feminists tend to\nunderstand power in terms of dyadic relations of\ndominance/subordination, often understood on analogy with the\nrelationship between master and slave.” (See the section on \nradical feminist approaches\n in the entry on feminist perspectives on power.)\nUnlike the more reformist politics of liberal feminism, radical\nfeminists of the 1980s largely sought to reject the prevailing order\naltogether, sometimes advocating separatism (Daly 1985, 1990). \nA new generation of radical feminist theorists are renewing the\ntradition, showing how it has respected concerns such as\nintersectionality (Whisnant 2016) and shares some of the commitments\nof the postmodern feminists discussed below, e.g., skepticism about\nany fixed gender identity or gender binaries and a more fluid and\nperformative approach to sexuality and politics (Snyder 2008), as well\nas the ways that power and privilege continue to hold women back\n(Chambers in Garry et al 2017, 656). \n\nThrough much of the twentieth century, many political theorists in\nEurope, the United States, and Latin America drew on socialist and\nMarxist texts to develop theories of social change attentive to issues\nof class relations and exploitation in modern capitalist\neconomies. After learning of the horrors of Stalinism, most Western\nMarxists and socialists were extremely critical of the communist\nsystems in the Soviet Union and later in China. Western, mostly\nanti-communist, Marxist thought flourished in Italy (with Antonio\nGramsci’s work), England (with Stuart Hall and Raymond Williams’\nwork), France (with the Socialisme ou Barbarie group), and\nthe United States (but less so there after McCarthyism, yet renewed\nsomewhat in the 1960s with the New Left). Jaggar’s 1983 book summed up\nwell the way feminists were using socialist and Marxist ideas to\nunderstand the way women were exploited and their laboring and\nreproductive work devalued and unpaid though necessary for capitalism\nto function. In the entry on\n feminist perspectives on class and work,\nthe authors point to much of the work that was going on in this field\nup through the mid-1990s.  But since then, the authors note, various postmodern,\npostcolonial, poststructuralist, and deconstructive theories have\ncriticized the bases for socialist and Marxist thought, including the\n“grand narrative” of economic determinism and the\nreduction of everything to economic and material relations. At the\nsame time, Marxist analyses are important parts of other contemporary\nfeminist philosophers’ work.  (See Dean 2009, Fraser 2009, Spivak\n1988.) So while the categories of socialist and Marxist feminisms are\nless relevant today, many feminist philosophers still take seriously\nthe need to attend to the material conditions of life and engage in\nthe hermeneutics of suspicion that Marxist analysis calls for. This is\nespcially evident in new feminist work in critical theory (See for\nexample Fraser 2009, Allen 2007, McAfee 2008, and Young 2000.)  \n\nWhere liberal feminists prefer to focus on equality, not just between\npeople but between the sexes more generally, radical feminists tend to\nsee sexual difference as something instituted by power. So in a\ncurious way, neither approach, however at odds with each other, takes\nsexual difference seriously. Rather, they see it as an effect of\npower, not something real in its own right. In contrast, the variety\nof theories addressed in this and the next section take seriously the\ncategory of woman and want to develop an ethics and politics upon\nit. The views considered in this section, largely developed from in\nthe Anglo-American context, take their cue from the material and lived\nconditions of women, both as mothers and as subjects, and the politics\nthat these experiences give rise to.  \n\nA prime example is care ethics,\nwhich, originally developed as an alternative to mainstream ethical\ntheory, has been harnessed to counter liberal political theory\n(Gilligan 1982; Held 1995). (See the discussion in the entry\non feminist ethics.)  Drawing on\nfeminist research in moral psychology (Gilligan 1982; Held 1995), this\nfield explores the ways in which the virtues that society and\nmothering cultivate in women can provide an alternative to the\ntraditional emphases in moral and political philosophy on\nuniversality, reason, and justice. Some care ethicists have sought to\ntake the virtues that had long been relegated to the private realm,\nsuch as paying particular attention to those who are vulnerable or\ntaking into consideration circumstances and not just abstract\nprinciples, and use them as well in the public realm. This approach\nhas led to intense debates between liberals who advocated universal\nideals of justice and care ethicists who advocated attention to the\nparticular, to relationships, to care. By the 1990s, however, many care\nethicists had revised their views. Rather than seeing care and justice\nas mutually exclusive alternatives, they began to recognize that\nattention to care should be accompanied by attention to fairness\n(justice) in order to attend to the plight of those with whom we have\nno immediate relation (Koggel 1998). \n\nThe care ethics approach raises the question of whether and, if so,\nhow women-as-care-givers have distinct virtues. Feminists as a whole have long\ndistanced themselves from the idea that women have any particular essence,\nchoosing instead to see femininity and its accompanying virtues as\nsocial constructs, dispositions that result from culture and\nconditioning, certainly not biological givens. So for care ethicists to\nchampion the virtues that have inculcated femininity seems also to\nchampion a patriarchal system that relegates one gender to the role of\ncaretaker. The care ethicists’ answer to this problem has largely been to flip the\nhierarchy, to claim that the work of the household is more meaningful\nand sustaining than the work of the polis. But critics, such as\nDrucilla Cornell, Mary Dietz, and Chantal Mouffe, argue that such a\nrevaluation keeps intact the dichotomy between the private and the\npublic and the old association of women’s work with childcare.\n(Butler and Scott 1992; Phillips and NetLibrary Inc 1998, pp.\n386–389) \nDisregard for the role of emotion in political life has long been\na policy in the history of philosophy, in particular because\nemotionality—like care—is frequently associated with women\nand racialized others. However, women philosophers have insisted on\nthe importance of this intersection (for example Hall 2005, Krause\n2008, and Nussbaum 2015). Building on the contributions of feminist\ncare ethicists and difference feminists who worked to show the\nsignificance of positive affects typically associated with\nfemininity—such as love, interest, and care—in ethical\nencounters (see Held 1995, Tronto 1993), other thinkers worried that\nthis appraisal merely reified a false (gendered) dichotomy between\nreason and emotion, mind and body. Instead, early work by Alison\nJaggar (1990), Elizabeth Spelman (1989 and 1991), Genevieve Lloyd\n(1993), Elizabeth Grosz (1994), and others argued that reason is both\nembodied and emotion-laden, and that emotion is an important resource\nfor epistemology in particular. Building on this work, feminist\npolitical theorists have argued that understanding the role of emotion\nand affect is crucial for understanding a number of important\npolitical phenomena: motivation for action (Krause 2008), collective\naction and community formation (Beltrán 2009 and 2010, Butler\n2004 and 2015), solidarity and patriotism (Nussbaum 2005 and 2015), as\nwell as vulnerability (Fineman 2013), racism and xenophobia (Ahmed\n2015, Anker 2014, Ioanide 2015). Meanwhile, others examine the\npolitical significance of specific emotions, for instance: shame\n(Ahmed 2015), precarity and grief (Butler 2004), anger (Spelman 1989,\nLorde 1984), fear (Anker 2015), and love (Nussbaum 2015).   More recently, many feminist critics have turned their attention\nto how neoliberalism demands resiliency in the face of increasing\nprecarity. Some borrow from Michel Foucault’s late work on\nbiopolitics, examining how neoliberal demands for autonomy,\nself-sufficiency, delf-discipline, and self-investment impact\nindividuals on the level of subjectivity, making both life and the\npossibility of political action to transform the conditions of life\nincreasingly untenable. Individuals, they argue, are met with\nincreasing vulnerability to economic forces and fewer resources to\novercome vulnerability due to social isolation and limited access to\nsocial services (Butler 2015, Povinelli 2011). Some feminists study\nhow subjectivity, affect, and morality accommodate these neoliberal\ntrends. For instance, this shows up in how the demand to\n“overcome vulnerability” via the contemporary emphasis on\nindividual “resilience” attempts to transform vulnerable\npersons, especially women, into productive neoliberal subjects (James\n2015), how productive emotions like “happiness” are\nencouraged and unruly ones like “willfulness” are\ndiscouraged (Berland 2011, Ahmed 2014), or how the targeted discourse\naround “self-care” can contribute to individualist\nconsumer culture that diminishes women’s capacities for collective\naction (Ahmed 2017). Instead, many feminist critiques challenge\nneoliberal individualism by reasserting that agency need not be\nsynonymous with autonomy, and propose nonsovereign or relational\naccounts of the agentic subject instead.   Another group of feminist political theorists who take sexual\ndifference seriously are those who work in the continental traditions,\nespecially poststructuralism, and attend to the ways in which language\nand meaning-systems structure experience. Notable among them are the\nso-called French Feminists, namely Cixous, Kristeva, and Irigaray. Of\nthem all, Irigaray may have the most developed political philosophy,\nincluding several books on the rights that should be afforded to girls\nand women. Irigaray’s early work (1985a and 1985b) made the case that\nin the history of philosophy women have been denied their own essence\nor identity. Rather, they have been positioned as men’s mirror\nnegation.  So that to be a man is to not be a woman, and hence that\nwoman equals only not-man. Her strategy in response to this is to\nspeak back from the margins to which women have been relegated and to\nclaim some kind of “essence” for women, and along with\nthat a set of rights that are specifically for girls and women\n(Irigaray 1994 and 1996). Criticisms of her views have been heated,\nincluding among feminists themselves, especially those who are wary of\nany kind of essentialist and biological conflation of women’s\nidentity. To the extent that Irigaray is an essentialist, her view\nwould indeed be relegated to the approach outlined here as symbolic\ndifference feminism, as Dietz 2003 does. But there are compelling\narguments that Irigaray is wielding essentialism strategically or\nmetaphorically, that she isn’t claiming that women really do have some\nkind of irreducible essence that the history of metaphysics has denied\nthem (Fuss 1989). This other reading would put Irigaray more in the\nperformative group described below.  The same kind of argument could\nbe made for the work of Julia Kristeva, that her metaphors of the\nfemale chora, for example, are describing the western imaginary, not\nany kind of womanly reality. So whether French feminist thought should\nbe grouped as difference feminism or performative feminism is still\nvery much open to debate. \n\nTo the extent that the above two types of feminist theory are\npinpointing some kind of specific difference between the sexes,\nthey raise concerns about essentialism or\nidentifying distinct values that women have as women. Such concerns\nare part of a larger set of criticisms that have run through feminist\ntheorizing since the 1970s, with non-white, non-middle-class, and\nnon-western women questioning the very category of\n“woman” and the notion that this title could be a\nboundary-spanning category that could unite women of various walks of\nlife. (See the entries on\n identity politics and\n feminist perspectives on sex and gender.)\n Criticisms of a unitary identity of\n“woman” have been motivated by worries that much feminist\ntheory has originated from the standpoint of a particular class of\nwomen who mistake their own particular standpoint for a universal\none. In her 1981 book, Ain’t I a Woman?: Black women and\nfeminism, bell hooks notes that the feminist movement pretends to\nspeak for all women but was made up of primarily white, middle class\nwomen who, because of their narrow perspective, did not represent the\nneeds of poor women and women of color and ended up reinforcing class\nstereotypes (hooks 1981). What is so damning about this kind of\ncritique is that it mirrors the one that feminists have leveled\nagainst mainstream political theorists who have taken the particular\ncategory of men to be a universal category of mankind, a schema that\ndoes not in fact include women under the category of mankind but marks\nthem as other (Lloyd 1993). \n\nHence, one of the most vexing issues facing feminist theory in\ngeneral and feminist political philosophy in particular is the matter\nof identity (see the entry on\n  identity politics).\nIdentity politics, itself a politically vexed term, refers to political practices of\nmobilizing for change on the basis of a political identity (women,\nBlack, Chicana, etc.). The philosophical debate is whether such\nidentities are based on some real difference or history of oppression,\nand also whether people should embrace identities that have\nhistorically been used to oppress them. Identity politics in feminist\npractice is fraught along at least two axes: whether there is any real\nessence or identity of woman in general and even if so whether the\ncategory of woman could be used to represent all women. People at the\nintersection of multiple marginalized identities (e.g, Black women) have raised\nquestions about which identity is foremost or whether either identity\nis apt. Such questions play out with the question of \n political representation—what \naspects of identity are politically salient and truly\nrepresentative, whether race, class, or gender (Phillips 1995; Young\n1997, 2000). The ontological question of women’s identity\ngets played out on the political stage when it comes to matters of\npolitical representation, group rights, and affirmative action. The\n2008 U.S. Democratic Party primary battle between Senators Barack Obama\nand Hillary Clinton turned this philosophical question into a very real\nand heated one from Black women throughout the United States. Was a\nBlack woman who supported Clinton a traitor to her race, or a Black\nwoman who supported Obama a traitor to her sex? Or did it make\nany sense to talk about identity in a way that would lead to charges of\ntreason? Of the approaches discussed above, radical and maternal\nfeminism seem particularly wedded to feminist identity politics. \n\nThe other large group of contemporary feminist philosophers that Dietz\n(2003) describes disagrees entirely with the idea that there is or\nneeds to be a single and universal category of “woman.”\nDietz refers to this group as diversity feminism, which began with\nwhat we described earlier: women of color and others pointing out that\nthe presuppositions of mainstream feminism were based on their very\nparticular race and class.  In the 1980s and 1990s philosophy along\nwith the rest of Western culture started grappling with demands for\nmulticultural perspectives. Shortly thereafter postcolonial theory\nraised the need to become aware of multiple global perspectives. As\nSharon Krause describes it, “this development involved the\n‘world diversification’ of feminism to a more global,\ncomparative, and differentiated body of work” (Krause 2011,\n106). This diversification, Krause notes, is also due to new\nliterature on intersectionality, that is, the ways in which\nthe intersections of our multiple identities (race, gender, orientation, ethnicity, etc.)\nall need to be attended to in talking about political change (Krause\n2011, 107). Intersectionality also links up with discussions of\n“hybridity” in postcolonial literature, of religion and\nglobalization, and of the experiences of LGBTQ people. “The\nresult is an explosion of knowledge about the lived experience of\ndifferently placed and multiply-positioned women” (Krause 2011,\n107). \n\nDecolonial feminists overlap in many areas with other women of color\nfeminists, but they bring several unique concerns specific to the\ncolonial and post-colonial experience. In contemporary decolonial\ntheory, these concerns are largely framed within the discourse of\n“coloniality,” first theorized in terms of “coloniality of power” by\nAnibal Quijano (Quijano 2003). Here, “coloniality” refers to how\nrelations between colonizer and colonized are racialized, for instance\nhow labor, subjectivity, and authority are racialized around the\ncolonial system of capitalist exploitation. (For more on\n“coloniality,” see Lugones 2010, Mignolo 2000, Maldonado Torres 2008,\nWynter 2003.) For feminist thinkers like María Lugones (2007, 2010),\ngender is another axis around which the global capitalist system of\npower classifies and dehumanizes people. For Lugones and others,\nincluding Oyeronke Oyewumi (1997), gender is a colonial imposition in\ntension with non-modern cosmologies, economies, and modes of\nkinship. Lugones calls this the “coloniality of gender,” noting that\nde-colonizing gender is part of a wider project of decolonial\nresistance opposed to the categorial, dichotomous, and hierarchical\nlogics of capitalist modernity that are rooted in the colonization of\nthe Americas.  \nIn feminist decolonial literature, resistance is often discussed in\nterms of the coloniality of gender (Lugones 2003, 2007, 2010; Oyewumi\n1997, 2004); language (Spivak 2010); identity and subjectivity – for\ninstance, accounts of hybridity, multiplicity, and mestizaje\n(Anzaldúa 1987, Ortega 2016, Moraga and Anzaldúa 2015); and\n“world-traveling” (Lugones 1995, Ortega 2016). Many of these same\nthinkers argue that feminism itself must be decolonized, critiquing\nfeminist universalisms that claim to account for the complex\nintersections of sexuality, race, gender, and class (see Mohanty 2003,\nLugones 2010).\n  Instersectionality, which is in part a theory of power, grew out\nof groundbreaking works by Black feminist theorists such as\nKimberlé Crenshaw’s “Demarginalizing the Intersection of\nRace and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination\nDoctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Practice” (Crenshaw\n1989), Patricia Hill Collins’s book Black Feminist Thought:\nKnowledge, Consciousness and the Politics of Empowerment (Collins\n1990), Angela Davis’s Women, Race, and Class (Davis 1981),\nand Patricia Williams’s The Alchemy of Race and Rights\n(Williams 1992). The impact of this work was felt strongly where it\noriginated in feminist legal theory (see\n feminist philosophy of law), and has\ncontinued to be an important concept for theories of power and\noppression in and out of feminist political philosophy. (See also the\nsection on intersectionality in\nthe  entry on\n discrimination.)  \n\nIf the diversity feminists, from multiculuturalists to postcolonial\nand intersectional thinkers, are right, then there is no reliable\ncategory of woman on which to base feminist politics.  By the end of\nthe 1990s some saw this as a radical danger of relativism, and the\nfield seemed to be at an impasse. But then another approach began to\nemerge. As Mary Dietz writes in her 2003 essay on current\ncontroversies in feminist theory, \n\nFollowing up on what has happened in feminist political theory since\nDietz’s article, Sharon Krause writes that this work is\n“contesting the old assumption that agency equals\nautonomy” and makes room “within agency for forms of\nsubjectivity and action that are nonsovereign but nevertheless\npotent” (Krause 2011, citing Allen 2007,\nBeltrán 2010, Butler 2004, Hirschman 2002, and Zerilli 2005.)\n“For some theorists,” Krause writes, “this shift\ninvolves thinking of agency and freedom in more collective ways, which\nemphasize solidarity, relationality, and constitutive\nintersubjectivity” (Krause 2011, 108, citing Butler 2004,\nCornell 2007, Mohanty 2003, and Nedelsky 2005). \n\nThis constellation of thinkers could be working in what we could call\nperformative political philosophy, performative in several senses: in\ntheorizing how agency is constituted, how political judgments can be\nmade in the absence of known rules (Honig 2009, 309), how new\nuniversals can be created and new communities constituted.\nPerformative feminist politics doesn’t worry about whether it is\npossible to come up with a single definition of “woman” or\nany other political identity; it sees identity as something that is\nperformatively created. “How we assume these identitites,”\nDrucilla Cornell writes, “is never something ‘out\nthere’ that effectively determines who we can be as men and\nwomen—gay, lesbian, straight, queer, transsexual, transgender,\nor otherwise” (Cornell 2003, 144). It is something that is\nshaped as we live and externalize identities. From a performative\nfeminist perspective, feminism is a project of anticipating and\ncreating better political futures in the absence of foundations. As\nLinda Zerilli writes, “politics is about making claims and\njudgments—and having the courage to do so—in the absence\nof the objective criteria or rules that could provide certain\nknowledge and the guarantee that speaking in women’s name will be\naccepted or taken up by others” (Zerilli 2005, 179). Drawing\nlargely on Arendt and Butler, Zerilli calls for a\n“freedom-centered feminism” that “would strive to\nbring about transformation in normative conceptions of gender without\nreturning to the classical notion of freedom as sovereignty”\nthat feminists have long criticized but found difficult to resist\n(ibid.). \n\nIn its feminist incarnations, this view also takes its cue from\nJudith Butler’s performative account of gender as well as Hannah\nArendt’s observation that human rights are created politically, as well\nas other thinkers’ ideas, to describe an anticipatory ideal of\npolitics. Linda Zerilli describes this kind of feminist politics as\n“the contingently based public practice of soliciting the\nagreement of others to what each of us claims to be\nuniversal” (Zerilli 2005, p. 173). From a performatve\nperspective, normative political claims appeal to other people, not to\nsupposed truths or foundations. \n\nThis view recuperates many of the ideals of the\nEnlightenment—such as freedom, autonomy, and justice—but in\na way that drops the Enlightenment’s metaphysical assumptions\nabout reason, progress, and human nature. Instead of seeing these\nideals as grounded in some metaphysical facts, this new view sees them\nas ideals that people hold and try to instantiate through practice and\nimagination. Where many ancient and modern ideals of politics were\nbased on suppositions about the nature of reality or of human beings,\ncontemporary political philosophies generally operate without\nsupposing that there are any universal or eternal truths. Some might\nsee this situation as ripe for nihilism, arbitrariness, or the exercise\nof brute power. The performative alternative is to imagine and try to\ncreate a better world by anticipating, claiming, and appealing to\nothers that it should be so. Even if there is no metaphysical\ntruth that human beings have dignity and infinite worth, people can act\nas if it were true in order to create a world in which it is seen to be\nso. \n\nPeformative feminist political philosophy shares liberal feminism’s\nappreciation for Enlightenment ideals but in a way that is skeptical\nabout foundations. Just as Zerilli performatively reconstitutes the\nconcept of freedom, Drucilla Cornell recuperates ideas of autonomy,\ndignity, and personhood, in a new performative capacity, as ideals\nthat people aspire to rather than as moral facts waiting to be\ndiscovered, applied, or realized. \n\nDespite the shared post-foundational theorizing among performative\nfeminists, when it comes to thinking about democratic politics, there\nare sharp divergences, namely on the question of “what it means\nto actualize public spaces and enact democratic politics” (Dietz\n2003, 419). On this questions, theorists tend to diverge into two\ngroups: associational and agonistic.  Associational theorists (e.g.,\nBenhabib 1992, 1996; Benhabib and Cornell 1987; Fraser 1989; Young\n1990, 1997, 2000) gravitate more toward deliberative democratic\ntheory, while agonistic theorists (e.g., Mouffe 1992, 1993, 1999,\n2000; Honig 1995; Ziarek 2001) worry that democratic theories that\nfocus on consensus can silence debate and thus they focus more on\nplurality, dissensus, and the ceaseless contestation within\npolitics. \n\nThe differences spring from, or perhaps lead to, different readings of\nthe philosopher who has most inspired performative political theory:\nHannah Arendt, namely Arendt’s ideas of speech and action in the\npublic sphere, of the meaning of plurality, of the ways in which human\nbeings can distinguish themselves. As Bonnie Honig, a champion of the\nagonistic model writes, Associational theorists tend to look for ways, amidst all the\ndifferences and questions about the lack of foundations, it is\npossible to come to agreement on matters of common concern. This is\nseen in feminist democratic theory, perhaps best known through the\nworks of Seyla Benhabib (Benhabib 1992, 1996), greatly inspired by her\nnon-agonistic reading of Arendt and of the work of the German critical\ntheorist, Jürgen Habermas. Benhabib’s work engages democratic\ntheorists quite broadly, not just feminist theorists. This passage of\nhers helps to clarify what she takes to be the best aim of a political\nphilosophy: a state of affairs to which all affected would assent. As\nshe writes, \n\nFollowing Habermas, Benhabib contends that certain conditions need to\nbe in place in order for members of a political community to arrive at\ndemocratic outcomes, namely the proceedings need to be\ndeliberative. Some take deliberation to be a matter of reasoned\nargumentation; others see it as less about reason or argumentation but\nmore about an open process of working through choices. (McAfee\n2004.) \n\nNot all theorists who tend toward the associational model embrace\ndeliberative theory so readily. Iris Young’s pioneering\nbook, Justice and the Politics of Difference and several of\nher subsequent works have been very influential and have led to a good\ndeal of hesitance in feminist theoretical communities about the claims\nof deliberative theory. Where Benhabib is confident that conditions\ncan be such that all who are affected can have a voice in\ndeliberations, Young points out that those who have been historically\nsilenced have a difficult time having their views heard or\nheeded. Young is skeptical of the claims of mainstream democratic\ntheory that democratic deliberative processes could lead to outcomes\nthat would be acceptable to all (Young 1990, 1997). Young, along with\nNancy Fraser (Fraser 1989) and others, worried that in the process of\ntrying to reach consensus, the untrained voices of women and others\nwho have been marginalized would be left out of the final\ntally. Young’s criticisms were very persuasive, leading a\ngeneration of feminist political philosophers to be wary of\ndeliberative democratic theory. Instead of deliberative democracy, in\nthe mid 1990s Young proposed a theory of communicative democracy,\nhoping to make way for a deliberative conception that was open to\nmeans of expression beyond the rational expression of mainstream\ndeliberative democratic theory. Young worried that deliberation as\ndefined by Habermas is too reason-based and leaves out forms of\ncommunication that women and people of color tend to use, including,\nas she puts it, “greeting, rhetoric, and\nstorytelling”. Young argued that these alternative modes of\ncommunication could provide the basis of a more democratic,\ncommunicative theory. In her last major book, Inclusion and\nDemocracy (Young 2000), Young had clearly moved to\nembrace deliberative theory itself, seeing the ways in which it could\nbe constructed to give voice to those who had been otherwise\nmarginalized. More recent feminist democratic theory has engaged\ndeliberative theory more positively. (See McAfee and Snyder 2007.) \n\nWhere liberal feminists inspired by John Rawls and democratic feminists\ninspired by \n Jürgen Habermas\nand/or \n John Dewey\n\nhold out the hope that democratic deliberations might lead to\ndemocratic agreements, agonistic feminists are wary of consensus as\ninherently undemocratic. Agonistic feminist political philosophy comes\nout of poststructural continental feminist and philosophical\ntraditions. It takes from Marxism the hope for a more radically\negalitarian society. It takes from contemporary continental philosophy\nnotions of subjectivity and solidarity as malleable and\nconstructed. Along with postmodern thought, it repudiates any notion\nof pre-existing moral or political truths or foundations (Ziarek\n2001). Its central claim is that feminist struggle, like other\nstruggles for social justice, is engaged in politics as ceaseless\ncontestation. Agonistic views see the nature of politics as inherently\nconflictual, with battles over power and hegemony being the central\ntasks of democratic struggle.  Advocates of agonistic politics worry\nthat the kind of consensus sought by democratic theorists (discussed\nabove) will lead to some kind of oppression or injustice by silencing\nnew struggles. As Chantal Mouffe puts it, “We have to accept\nthat every consensus exists as a temporary result of a provisional\nhegemony, as a stabilization of power, and that it always entails some\nform of exclusion” (Mouffe 2000, 104). \n\nWhere associational theorists seek out ways that people can overcome\nsystematically distorted communication and deliberation, Dietz notes\nthat agonists eschew this project because they understand politics as\n“essentially a practice of creation, reproduction,\ntransformation and articulation.... Simply put, associational\nfeminists scrutinize the conditions of exclusion in order to theorize\nthe emancipation of the subject in the public sphere of communicative\ninteraction; agonistic feminists deconstruct emancipatory procedures\nto disclose how the subject is both produced through political\nexclusions and positioned against them” (Dietz 2003, 422). \n\nNew work in democratic theory and new readings of Arendt’s philosophy\noffer hope of moving beyond the associational/agonistic divide in\nperformative feminist politics (Barker et al. 2012). Benhabib’s\nproceduralism is being surpassed with more affect-laden accounts of\ndeliberation (Krause 2008; Howard 2017). Instead of the rational back-and-forth of\nreasoned argumentation, theorists are beginning to see deliberative\ntalk as forms of constituting the subject, judging without pre-conceived truths,\nand performatively creating new political projects. \n\nIn sum, feminist political philosophy is a still evolving field of\nthought that has much to offer mainstream political philosophy. In the\npast two decades it has come to exert a stronger influence over\nmainstream political theorizing, raising objections that mainstream\nphilosophers have had to address, though not always very convincingly.\nAnd in its newest developments it promises to go even further.","contact.mail":"k.b.howard@emory.edu","contact.domain":"emory.edu"}]
