When those steps involve preferential\nselection—selection on the basis of race, gender, or\nethnicity—affirmative action generates intense controversy.\n\n\n\nThe development, defense, and contestation of preferential affirmative\naction has proceeded along two paths. One has been legal and\nadministrative as courts, legislatures, and executive departments of\ngovernment have made and applied rules requiring affirmative action.\nThe other has been the path of public debate, where the practice of\npreferential treatment has spawned a vast literature, pro and con.\nOften enough, the two paths have failed to make adequate contact, with\nthe public quarrels not always very securely anchored in any existing\nlegal basis or practice.\n\n\n\nThe ebb and flow of public controversy over affirmative action can\nbe pictured as two spikes on a line, the first spike representing a\nperiod of passionate debate that began around 1972 and tapered off\nafter 1980, and the second indicating a resurgence of debate in the\n1990s leading up to Supreme Court’s decisions in 2003 and 2016\nupholding certain kinds of affirmative action. The first spike\nencompassed controversy about gender and racial preferences alike. This\nis because in the beginning affirmative action was as much about the\nfactory, the firehouse, and the corporate suite as about the college\ncampus. The second spike represents a quarrel about race and ethnicity.\nThis is because the burning issue at the turn of the twentieth-first\ncentury is about college\n admissions. At selective colleges, women\nneed no boost; African-Americans and Hispanics\n do.[1]\n\n\n\nIn 1972, affirmative action became an inflammatory public issue.\nTrue enough, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 already had made something\ncalled “affirmative action” a remedy federal courts could\nimpose on violators of the Act. Likewise, after 1965 federal\ncontractors had been subject to President Lyndon Johnson’s Executive\nOrder 11246, requiring them to take “affirmative action” to\nmake sure they were not discriminating. But what did this 1965 mandate\namount to? The Executive Order assigned to the Secretary of Labor the\njob of specifying rules of implementation. In the meantime, as the\nfederal courts were enforcing the Civil Rights Act against\ndiscriminating companies, unions, and other institutions, the\nDepartment of Labor mounted an ad hoc attack on the construction\nindustry by cajoling, threatening, negotiating, and generally\nstrong-arming reluctant construction firms into a series of region-wide\n“plans” in which they committed themselves to numerical\nhiring goals. Through these contractor commitments, the Department\ncould indirectly pressure recalcitrant labor unions, who supplied the\nemployees at job sites. \n\nWhile the occasional court case and government initiative made the\nnews and stirred some controversy, affirmative action was pretty far\ndown the list of public excitements until the autumn of 1972, when the\nSecretary of Labor’s Revised Order No. 4, fully implementing the\nExecutive Order, landed on campus by way of directives from the\nDepartment of Health, Education, and Welfare. Its predecessor, Order\nNo. 4, first promulgated in 1970, cast a wide net over American\ninstitutions, both public and private. By extending to all contractors\nthe basic apparatus of the construction industry “plans,”\nthe Order imposed a one-size-fits-all system of \n“underutilization analyses,” “goals,” and\n“timetables” on hospitals, banks, trucking companies,\nsteel mills, printers, airlines—indeed, on all the scores of\nthousands of institutions, large and small, that did business with the\ngovernment, including a special set of institutions with a\nparticularly voluble and articulate constituency, namely, American\nuniversities. \n\nAt first, university administrators and faculty found the rules of\nOrder No. 4 murky but hardly a threat to the established order. The\nnumber of racial and ethnic minorities receiving PhDs each year and\nthus eligible for faculty jobs was tiny. Any mandate to increase their\nrepresentation on campus would require more diligent searches by\nuniversities, to be sure, but searches fated nevertheless largely to\nmirror past results. The 1972 Revised Order, on the other hand, effected a\nchange that punctured any campus complacency: it included women among\nthe “protected classes” whose\n“underutilization” demanded the setting of\n“goals” and “timetables” for “full\nutilization” (Graham 1990, 413). Unlike African-Americans and\nHispanics, women were getting PhDs in substantial and growing\nnumbers. If the affirmative action required of federal contractors was\na recipe for “proportional representation,” then Revised\nOrder No. 4 was bound to leave a large footprint on campus. Some among\nthe professoriate exploded in a fury of opposition to the new rules,\nwhile others responded with an equally vehement defense of\nthem.[2] \n\nAs it happened, these events coincided with another development,\nnamely the “public turn” in philosophy. For several\ndecades Anglo-American philosophy had treated moral and political\nquestions obliquely. On the prevailing view, philosophers were suited\nonly to do “conceptual analysis”—they could lay\nbare, for example, the conceptual architecture of the idea of justice,\nbut they were not competent to suggest political principles,\nconstitutional arrangements, or social policies that actually did\njustice.  Philosophers might do “meta-ethics” but not\n“normative ethics.” This viewed collapsed in the 1970s\nunder the weight of two counter-blows. First, John Rawls published in\n1971 A Theory of Justice, an elaborate, elegant, and inspiring\ndefense of a normative theory of justice (Rawls 1971).\nSecond, in the same year Philosophy & Public Affairs,\nwith Princeton University’s impeccable pedigree, began life, a few\nmonths after Florida State’s Social Theory and\nPractice. These journals, along with a re-tooled older\nperiodical, Ethics, became self-conscious platforms for\nsocially and politically engaged philosophical writing, born out of\nthe feeling that in time of war (the Vietnam War) and social tumult\n(the Civil Rights Movement, Women’s Liberation), philosophers ought to\ndo, not simply talk about, ethics.  In 1973, Philosophy &\nPublic Affairs published Thomas Nagel’s “Equal Treatment\nand Compensatory Justice” (Nagel 1973) and Judith Jarvis\nThomson’s “Preferential Hiring” (Thomson 1973), and the\nphilosophical literature on affirmative action burgeoned\n forth.[3] \n\nIn contention was the nature of those “goals” and\n“timetables” imposed on every contractor by Revised Order\nNo. 4. Weren’t the “goals” tantamount to\n“quotas,” requiring institutions to use racial or gender\npreferences in their selection processes? Some answered\n“no” (Ezorsky 1977, 86).  Properly understood, affirmative\naction did not require (or even permit) the use of gender or racial\npreferences.  Others said “yes” (Goldman 1976, 182–3).\nAffirmative action, if it did not impose preferences outright, at\nleast countenanced them.  Among the yea-sayers, opinion divided\nbetween those who said preferences were morally permissible and those\nwho said they were not.  Within the “morally permissible”\nset, different writers put forward different justifications. \n\nThe essays by Thomson and Nagel defended the use of preferences but on\ndifferent grounds. Thomson endorsed job preferences for women and\nAfrican-Americans as a form of redress for their past exclusion\nfrom the academy and the workplace. Preferential policies, in her\nview, worked a kind of justice. Nagel, by contrast, argued that\npreferences might work a kind of social good, and without doing\nviolence to justice.  Institutions could for one or another good\nreason properly depart from standard meritocratic selection criteria\nbecause the whole system of tying economic reward to earned\ncredentials was itself indefensible. \n\nJustice and desert lay at the heart of subsequent arguments. Several\nwriters took to task Thomson’s argument that preferential hiring\njustifiably makes up for past wrongs. Preferential hiring seen as\nredress looks perverse, they contended, since it benefits\nindividuals (African-Americans and women possessing good educational\ncredentials) least likely harmed by past wrongs while it burdens\nindividuals (younger white male applicants) least likely to be\nresponsible for past wrongs (Simon 1974, 315–19; Sher 1975, 162;\nSher 1979, 81–82; and Goldman 1976, \n190–1).[4]\n Instead of doing justice, contended the critics, preferential\ntreatment violated rights. What rights were at issue? The right of an\napplicant “to equal consideration” (Thomson 1973, 377;\nSimon 1974, 312), the right of the maximally competent to an open\nposition (Goldman 1976, 191; Goldman 1979, 24–8), or the right\nof everyone to equal opportunity (Gross 1977a, 382; Gross 1978,\n97). Moreover, according to the critics, preferential treatment\nconfounded desert by severing reward from a “person’s character,\ntalents, choices and abilities” (Simon 1979, 96), by\n“subordinating merit, conduct, and character to race”\n(Eastland and Bennett 1979, 144), and by disconnecting outcomes from\nactual liability and damage (Gross 1978, 125–42). \n\nDefenders of preferences were no less quick to enlist justice and\ndesert in their cause. Mary Anne Warren, for example, argued that in a\ncontext of entrenched gender discrimination, gender preferences might\nimprove the “overall fairness” of job selections. Justice\nand individual desert need not be violated. \n\nLikewise, James Rachels defended racial preferences as devices to\nneutralize unearned advantages by whites. Given the pervasiveness of\nracial discrimination, it is likely, he argued, that the superior\ncredentials offered by white applicants do not reflect their greater\neffort, desert, or even ability. Rather, the credentials reflect their\nmere luck at being born white. “Some white…[applicants]\nhave better qualifications…only because they have not had to\ncontend with the obstacles faced by their African-American\ncompetitors” (Rachels 1978, 162).  Rachels was less confident\nthan Warren that preferences worked uniformly accurate\noffsets. Reverse discrimination might do injustice to some whites; yet\nits absence would result in injustices to African-Americans who have\nbeen unfairly handicapped by their lesser advantages. \n\nRachels’ diffidence was warranted in light of the counter-responses.\nIf racial and gender preferences for jobs (or college admissions) were\nsupposed to neutralize unfair competitive advantages, they needed to\nbe calibrated to fit the variety of backgrounds aspirants brought to\nany competition for these goods. Simply giving blanket preferences to\nAfrican-Americans or women seemed much too ham-handed an approach if\nthe point was to micro-distribute opportunities fairly (Sher 1975,\n165ff). \n\nTo many of its critics, reverse discrimination was simply\nincoherent. When “the employers and the schools favor\nwomen and blacks,” objected Lisa Newton, they commit the same\ninjustice perpetrated by Jim Crow discrimination. “Just as the\nprevious discrimination did, this reverse discrimination violates the\npublic equality which defines citizenship” (Newton 1973,\n 310).[5] \n\nWilliam Bennett and Terry Eastland likewise saw racial preferences\nas in some sense illogical: \n\nWhen Eastland and Bennett alluded to those who favored using race to\nget to a point where race doesn’t count, they had in mind specifically\nthe Supreme Court’s Justice Blackmun who, in the famous 1978\nBakke case (discussed below), put his own view in just those\nsimple terms. For Blackmun, the legitimacy of racial preferences was\nto be measured by how fast using them moves us toward a society where\nrace doesn’t matter (a view developed in subtle detail by the\nphilosopher Richard Wasserstrom in Wasserstrom 1976). While the\ncritics of preferences claimed to find the very idea of using race to\nend racism illogical and incoherent, they also fell back on principle\nto block Blackmun’s instrumental defense should it actually prove both\nreasonable and plausible. “The moral issue comes in classic\nform,” wrote Carl Cohen. “Terribly important\nobjectives…appear to require impermissible means.”  Cohen asked,\n“might we not wink at the Constitution this once” and allow\npreferences to do their good work (Cohen 1995, 20)?  Neither he nor\nother critics thought so.  Principle must hold firm. “[I]n the\ndistribution of benefits under the laws all racial\nclassifications are invidious” (Cohen 1995, 52). \n\nBut what, exactly, is the principle—constitutional or\nmoral—that always bars the use of race as a means to\n“terribly important objectives”? Alan Goldman did more\nthan anyone in the early debate to formulate and ground a relevant\nprinciple. Using a contractualist framework, he surmised that rational\ncontractors would choose a rule of justice requiring positions to be\nawarded by competence. On its face, this rule would seem to preclude\nfilling positions by reference to factors like race and gender that\nare unrelated to competence. However, Goldman’s\n“rule” blocked preferences only under certain empirical\nconditions. Goldman explained the derivation of the rule and its\nconsequent limit this way: \n\nIn other words, if “terribly important\nobjectives” having to do with\nequalizing opportunities in a system rife with unjust inequalities could in\nfact be furthered by measured and targeted reverse\ndiscrimination, justice wouldn’t stand in the way. Goldman’s principle\ndid not have the adamantine character Cohen and other critics sought\nin a bar to preferences. Where can such an unyielding principle be\nfound? I postpone further examination of this question until I discuss\nthe Bakke case, below, whose split opinions constitute an\nextended debate on the meaning of constitutional equality. \n\nThe terms of the popular debate over racial and gender preferences\noften mirrored the arguments philosophers and other academics were\nmaking to each other. Preference’s defenders offered many reasons to\njustify them, reasons having to do with compensatory or distributive\njustice, as well as reasons having to do with social utility (more\nAfrican-Americans in the police department would enable it better to\nserve the community, more female professors in the classroom would\ninspire young women to greater achievements). Critics of preferences\nretorted by pointing to the law. And well they should, since the text\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964 seemed a solid anchor even if general\nprinciple proved elusive. Title VI of the Act promised that\n“[n]o person…shall, on the ground of race, color, or\nnational origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the\nbenefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or\nactivity receiving Federal financial\n assistance.”[7]\n Title VII similarly prohibited\nall employment practices that discriminated on the basis of race,\ngender, religion, or national\n origin.[8] \n\nIn face of the plain language of Titles VI and VII, how did\npreferential hiring and promotion ever arise in the first place? How\ncould they be justified legally? Part of the answer lies in the meaning\nof “discrimination.” The Civil Rights Act did not define\nthe term. The federal courts had to do that job themselves, and the\ncases before them drove the definition in a particular direction. Many\nfactories and businesses prior to 1964, especially in the South, had\nin place overtly discriminatory policies and rules. For example, a\ncompany’s policy might have openly relegated African-Americans to the\nmaintenance department and channeled whites into operations, sales,\nand management departments, where the pay and opportunities for\nadvancement were far better. If, after passage of the Civil Rights\nAct, the company willingly abandoned its openly segregative policy,\nit could still carry forward the effects of its past segregation\nthrough other already-existing facially neutral rules. For example, a\ncompany policy that required workers to give up their seniority\nin one department if they transferred to another would have locked in\nplace older African-American maintenance workers as effectively as the\ncompany’s own prior segregative rule that made them ineligible to transfer\nat all. Consequently, courts began striking down facially neutral\nrules that carried through the effects of an employer’s past\ndiscrimination, regardless of the original intent or provenance of the\nrules. “Intent” was effectively decoupled from\n“discrimination.” In 1971, the Supreme Court ratified this\nprocess, giving the following\nconstruction of Title VII: \nThe objective of Congress in the enactment of Title VII…was\nto achieve equality of employment opportunities and remove barriers\nthat have operated in the past to favor an identifiable group of white\nemployees over other employees. Under the Act, practices, procedures,\nor tests neutral on their face, and even neutral in terms of intent,\ncannot be maintained if they operate to “freeze” the status\nquo of prior discriminatory employment practices. \n\nWhat is required by Congress is the removal of artificial,\narbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to employment when the barriers\noperate invidiously to exclude on the basis of racial or other\nimpermissible\n classification.[9] \n\nIn a few short paragraphs the Court advanced from proscribing\npractices that froze in place the effects of a firm’s own past\ndiscrimination to proscribing practices that carried through the\neffects of past discrimination generally. The Court characterized\nstatutory discrimination as any exclusionary practice not necessary\nto an institution’s activities. Since many practices in most\ninstitutions were likely to be exclusionary, rejecting minorities and\nwomen in greater proportion than white men, all institutions needed to\nreassess the full range of their practices to look for, and correct,\ndiscriminatory effect. Against this backdrop, the generic idea of\naffirmative action took form: \n\nThe point of such affirmative action: to induce change in institutions\nso that they could comply with the nondiscrimination mandate of the\nCivil Rights Act. \n\nHowever, suppose this self-monitoring and revising fell short? In\nearly litigation under the Civil Rights Act, courts concluded that some\ninstitutions, because of their histories of exclusion and\ntheir continuing failure to find qualified women or minorities, needed\nstronger medicine. Courts ordered these institutions to adopt\n“quotas,” to take in specific numbers of formerly excluded\ngroups on the assumption that once these new workers were securely\nlodged in place, the institutions would adapt to this new\n reality.[11] \n\nThroughout the 1970s, courts and government enforcement agencies\nextended this idea across the board, requiring a wide range of firms\nand organizations—from AT&T to the Alabama Highway\nPatrol—temporarily to select by the numbers. In all these cases,\nthe use of preferences was tied to a single purpose: to prevent\nongoing and future discrimination. Courts carved out this\njustification for preferences not through caprice but through\nnecessity. They found themselves confronted with a practical dilemma\nthat Congress had never envisaged and thus never addressed when it\nwrote the Civil Rights Act.  The dilemma was this: courts could impose\nracial preferences to change foot-dragging or inept defendants (and by\ndoing so apparently transgress the plain prohibition in Title VII) or\nthey could order less onerous steps they knew would be ineffective,\nthus letting discrimination continue (and by doing so violate their\nduty under Title VII). Reasonably enough, the federal courts resolved\nthis dilemma by appeal to the broad purposes of the Civil Rights Act\nand justified racial preferences where needed to prevent ongoing and\nfuture\n discrimination.[12] \n\nThus, preferential affirmative action in the workplace served the\nsame rationale as the non-preferential sort. Its purpose was\nnot to compensate for past wrongs, offset unfair advantage,\nappropriately reward the deserving, or yield a variety\nof social goods; its purpose was to change institutions so they could\ncomply with the nondiscrimination mandate of the Civil Rights Act. \n\nIn the 1970s, while campuses were embroiled in debate about how to\nincrease African-Americans and women on the faculty, universities were\nalso putting into effect schemes to increase minority presence within\nthe student body. Very selective universities, in particular, needed\nnew initiatives because only a handful of African-American and\nHispanic high school students possessed test scores and grades good\nenough to make them eligible for admission. These institutions faced a\nchoice: retain their admissions criteria unchanged and live with the\nupshot—hardly any African-Americans and Hispanics on\ncampus—or fiddle with their criteria to get a more substantial\nrepresentation. Most elected the second path. \n\nThe Medical School of the University of California at Davis\nexemplified a particularly aggressive approach. It reserved sixteen of\nthe one hundred slots in its entering classes for minorities. In 1973\nand again in 1974, Allan Bakke, a white applicant, was denied\nadmission although his test scores and grades were better than most or\nall of those admitted through the special program. He sued. In 1977,\nhis case, Regents of the University of California v. Bakke,\nreached the Supreme Court. The Court rendered its decision a year\n later (438 U.S. 265 [1978]).[13] \n\nAn attentive reader of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act might have\nthought this case was an easy call. So, too, thought four justices on\nthe Supreme Court, who voted to order Bakke admitted to the Medical\nSchool. Led by Justice Stevens, they saw the racially segregated,\ntwo-track scheme at the Medical School (a recipient of federal funds)\nas a clear violation of the plain language of the Title. \n\nFour other members of the Court, led by Justice Brennan, wanted very\nkeenly to save the Medical School program. To find a more attractive\nterrain for doing battle, they made an end-run around Title VI, arguing\nthat, whatever its language, it had no independent meaning itself. It\nmeant in regard to race only what the Constitution\n meant.[14]\n Thus,\ninstead of having to parse the stingy and unyielding language of Title\nVI (“no person shall be subjected to…on the ground of\nrace”), the Brennan group could turn their creative energies to\ninterpreting the broad and vague language of the Fourteenth Amendment\n(“no person shall be denied the equal protection of the\nlaws”), which provided much more wiggle-room for justifying\nracial preferences. The Brennan justices persuaded one other member,\nJustice Powell, to join them in their view of Title VI. But Powell\ndidn’t agree with their view of the Constitution. He argued that the\nMedical School’s policy was unconstitutional and voted that Bakke must\nbe admitted. His vote, added to the four votes of the Stevens group,\nmeant that Allan Bakke won his case and that Powell got to write the\nopinion of the Court. The Brennan strategy didn’t reap the fruit it\nintended. \n\nAgainst the leanings of the Brennan group, who would distinguish\nbetween “benign” and “malign” uses of race and\ndeal more leniently with the former, Powell insisted that the\nFourteenth Amendment’s promise of “equal protection of the\nlaw” must mean the same thing for all, black and white alike. To\nparaphrase Powell: \n\nWhat, then, was the practical meaning of a “sufficiently\nabsolute” rendering of the principle of equal protection? It was\nthis: when the decisions of state agents ‘touch upon an\nindividual’s race or ethnic background, he is entitled to a judicial\ndetermination that the burden he is asked to bear on that basis is\nprecisely tailored to serve a compelling governmental\n interest (Bakke, at 300).\n\n \n\nPowell, with this standard in hand, then turned to look at the four\nreasons the Medical School offered for its special program: (i) to\nreduce “the historic deficit of traditionally disfavored\nminorities in medical schools and the medical profession;” (ii)\nto counter “the effects of societal discrimination;” (iii)\nto increase “the number of physicians who will practice in\ncommunities currently underserved;” and (iv) to obtain “the\neducational benefits that flow from an ethnically diverse student\n body” (Bakke, at 307). Did any or all of them specify a\ncompelling governmental interest? Did they necessitate use of racial\npreferences? \n\nAs to the first reason, Powell dismissed it out of hand. \n\nAs to the second reason, Powell allowed it more force. A state has a\nlegitimate interest in ameliorating the effects of past discrimination.\nEven so, contended Powell, the Court, \n\nAnd the Medical School does not purport to have made, and is in no\nposition to make, such findings. Its broad mission is education, not\nthe formulation of any legislative policy or the adjudication of\nparticular claims of illegality.…[I]solated segments of our vast\ngovernmental structures are not competent to make those decisions, at\nleast in the absence of legislative mandates and legislatively\ndetermined criteria (Bakke, at 309). \n\nAs to the third reason, Powell found it, too, insufficient. The\nMedical School provided no evidence that the best way it could\ncontribute to increased medical services to underserved communities was\nto employ a racially preferential admissions scheme. Indeed, the\nMedical School provided no evidence that its scheme would result in any\nbenefits at all to such\n communities (Bakke, at 311). \n\nThis left the fourth reason. Here Powell found merit. A university’s\ninterest in a diverse student body is legitimated by the First\nAmendment’s implied protection of academic freedom. This constitutional\nhalo makes the interest “compelling.” However, the Medical\nSchool’s use of a racial and ethnic classification scheme was not\n“precisely tailored” to effect the School’s interest in\ndiversity, argued Powell. \n\nThe diversity which provides an educational atmosphere\n“conducive to speculation, experiment and creation”\nincludes a nearly endless range of experiences, talents, and attributes\nthat students might bring to campus. In reducing diversity to racial\nand ethnic quotas, the Medical School wholly misconceived this\nimportant educational interest. \n\nIn sum, although the last of the Medical School’s four reasons\nencompassed a “compelling governmental interest,” the\nSchool’s special admissions program was not necessary to effect the\ninterest. The special admissions program was unconstitutional. So\nconcluded Justice Powell. \n\nThis was a conclusion Justice Brennan tried vigorously to forestall.\nBrennan agreed with Powell that “equal protection” must\nmean the same thing—that is, remain one rule—whether\napplied to blacks or whites. But the same rule applied to different\ncircumstances need not yield the same results. Racial preferences\ncreated for different reasons and producing different outcomes need not\nall be judged in the same harsh, virtually fatal, manner. This point\nwas the crux of Brennan’s defense of the Medical School’s policy. \n\nPowell thought there was no principled way to distinguish\n“benign” from “malign” discrimination, but\nBrennan insisted there was. He argued that if the Court looked\ncarefully at its past cases striking down Jim Crow laws, it would see\nthe principle at work. What the Court found wrong in Jim Crow was that\nit served no purpose except to mark out and stigmatize one group of\npeople as inferior. The “cardinal principle” operating in\nthe Court’s decisions condemned racial classifications “drawn on\nthe presumption that one race is inferior to another” or that\n“put the weight of government behind racial hatred and\n separation” (Bakke, at 358 [Brennan, dissenting]).\n Brennan agreed with Powell that no public\nracial classification motivated by racial animus, no classification\nwhose purpose is to stigmatize people with the “badge of\ninferiority,” could withstand judicial scrutiny. However, the\nMedical School’s policy, even if ill-advised or mistaken, reflected a\npublic purpose far different from that found in Jim Crow. The policy\nought not be treated as though it were cut from the same cloth. \n\nBrennan granted that if a state adopted a racial classification for\nthe purpose of humiliating whites, or stigmatizing Allan Bakke as\ninferior and confining him to second-class citizenship, that\nclassification would be as odious as Jim Crow. But the Medical School’s\npolicy had neither this purpose nor this effect. Allan Bakke may have\nbeen upset and resentful at losing out under the special plan, but he\nwasn’t “in any sense stamped as an inferior by the Medical\nSchool’s rejection of him.” Nor did his loss constitute a\n“pervasive injury,” in the sense that wherever he went he\nwould be treated as a “second-class citizen” because of his\n color (Bakke, at 376 [Brennan, dissenting]). \n\nIn short, argued Brennan, the principle expressed in the Equal\nProtection Clause should be viewed as an anti-caste principle,\na principle that uniformly and consistently rejects all public\nlaw whose purpose is to subject people to an inferior and degraded\nstation in life, whether they are black or \n white.[15]\n Of course, given\nthe asymmetrical position of whites and blacks in our country, we are\nnot likely to encounter laws that try to stigmatize whites as an\ninferior caste (much less succeed at it). But this merely shows that a\nprinciple applied to different circumstances produces different\nresults. Because the Medical School’s program sought to undo the\neffects of a racial caste system long-enduring in America, it\nrepresented a purpose of great social importance and should not be\nfound Constitutionally infirm: so maintained\n Brennan (Bakke, at 363 [Brennan, dissenting]). \n\nJustice Powell never successfully engaged this way of reading\n“constitutional equality.” His insistence on clear, plain,\nunitary, absolute principle did not cut against the Brennan view. The\nissue between Powell and Brennan was not the consistency and stringency\nof the principle but its content. If the Constitution says, “The\nstate cannot deliberately burden someone by race if its purpose is\nto create or maintain caste,” then constitutional law\ndoesn’t block any of the Medical School’s\n justifications.[16] \n\nIf we turn away from exegesis of the Constitution, are we likely to\nfind in political theory itself any principle of equality implying that\nevery use of racial preferences in every circumstance\nworks an intolerable injustice?  \nThe prospects seem dim. Won’t very general notions of equality\nlend themselves to defending affirmative action (and the social\ninclusion it effects) as well as condemning it (and the racial\nnon–neutrality it\n involves)?[17] \nThe challenge here is well-illustrated by\nCarl Cohen’s most recent effort, in a debate with James Sterba,\nto extract a strict prohibition on racial preferences from the\nAristotelian principle that “equals should be treated\nequally” (Cohen and Sterba 2003, 23).  This principle, urges\nCohen, “certainly entails at least this: It is wrong, always and\neverywhere, to give special advantage to any group simply on the basis\nof physical characteristics that have no relevance to the award given\nor the burden imposed” (Cohen and Sterba 2003, 25).  Whether\nanything interesting follows from this proposition depends on how we\nconstrue “relevance.” Cohen admits that public policy may\nrightly treat some people differently because of their physical\ncharacteristics. For example, the state might offer special assistance\nto the old or disabled. Now, this example suggests that the relevance\nof physical differences is something independent of social policy. Age\nand disability, it seems, are real features of persons and public\npolicy simply tracks them. However, the difference that differences\nmake is not something itself given by nature; it is determined by\npublic purposes. Age and disability are made relevant in this\nmanner—in the one case, by the social purpose of assuring that\npeople do not have to live in poverty when they can no longer work; in\nthe other case, by the social purpose of assuring that people are not\nforeclosed from developing and marketing their talents by impediments\nin the (largely constructed) physical environment.  \n\nPurpose determines relevancy, and this is true whether or not the\nrelevant differences are physical. If the nation thinks it desirable to change white\ninstitutions so that they are less uniformly white, that purpose links\nskin color to recruitment. \n\nBecause the Aristotelian principle by itself doesn’t rule out\nracial preferences (since blacks and whites may be relevantly\ndifferent with respect to certain legitimate public purposes), it is\nnot surprising that Cohen also invokes a substantive conception of\nequality: “All members of humankind are equally ends in themselves,\nall have equal dignity—and therefore all are entitled to equal\nrespect from the community and its laws” (Cohen and Sterba 2003,\n24). This principle, however, brings us back to the interpretive\nquestions about “equal protection of the laws” played out in the\nPowell-Brennan exchange in Bakke. By Justice Brennan’s lights,\nAllen Bakke’s basic dignity was not violated. The Medical\nSchool’s two-track policy that resulted in Bakke’s\nrejection did not, by intent or effect, stigmatize him as inferior, or\nmark him off as a member of a despised caste, or turn him into a\nsecond-class citizen. Bakke arguably had to bear a particular burden\nbecause of his race but the burden was not significantly different\nobjectively from others that public policy might have thrown his\nway. If the Medical School had reserved sixteen of its seats for\napplicants from economically deprived backgrounds, no one would have\nsuggested that it had violated the equal protection clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment. Yet under this hypothetical policy Allan Bakke\ncould have lost out as well—lost out to low-income applicants\nwhose college grades and MCAT scores were inferior to his own. Allen\nBakke may have felt aggrieved at losing out under the Medical\nSchool’s policy of racial preferences, but it is not enough to\nshow that those who lose out under some public scheme feel offended or\ndisgruntled. Cohen needs to specify a conception of dignity in which\nbearing unequal burdens on behalf of urgent social ends invariably\namounts to an assault on dignity if the burdens happen to be assigned\nby race. This specification remains unfinished in his work so far.\n \n\nHow, if it held the Medical School’s policy unconstitutional, did\nJustice Powell’s Bakke opinion become the basis upon which\nuniversities across the land enacted—or\nmaintained—racially preferential admissions policies? \n\nIf Powell had concluded with his assessment of the Medical School’s\nfour justifications, Bakke would have left university\naffirmative action in a precarious situation. However, he didn’t stop\nthere. In an earlier ruling on Bakke’s lawsuit, the California Supreme\nCourt had forbidden the Medical School to make any use of race or\nethnicity in its admissions decisions. Powell thought this went too\nfar. Given higher education’s protected interest in\n“diversity,” and given that a student’s race or ethnicity\nmight add to diversity just in the same way that her age, work\nexperience, family background, special talents, foreign language\nfluency, athletic prowess, military service, and unusual\naccomplishments might, Powell vacated that portion of the California\nSupreme Court’s order. \n\nThen he added some dicta for guidance. If universities want to\nunderstand diversity and the role that race and ethnicity might play in\nachieving it, they should look to Harvard, proposed Powell, and he\nappended to his opinion a long statement of Harvard’s affirmative action program.\nIn such a program, Powell contended, racial or ethnic background\nmight \n\nIn these off-hand comments, universities saw a green light for pushing\nahead aggressively with their affirmative action programs.  Justice\nPowell’s basic holding could not have been plainer: any system like\nthe Medical School’s that assessed applications along two different\ntracks defined by race or that used numerical racial quotas must fail\nconstitutional muster. Yet by the mid-1980s universities across the\nland had in place systems of admissions and scholarships that\nexhibited one or both of these features. When the University of\nMaryland’s Banneker scholarships—awarded only to\nAfrican-American students—were held in violation of the\nConstitution in 1994, the house of cards forming university\naffirmative action began to\n fall.[18]\n In 1996, the Court of Appeals for\nthe Fifth Circuit struck down the University of Texas Law School’s two-track\nadmissions program.\n In 1998, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit struck down a Boston plan\nassigning students to selective high schools by\n race.[19]\n In 2001, two more schools saw their admissions programs invalidated\nby federal courts: the University of\n Georgia[20]\n and the University of Michigan Law\n School.[21]\n In many of these cases, educational\ninstitutions were using schemes that made race something very much more than\nJustice Powell’s “plus”\n factor.[22]\n The Fifth Circuit Court’s ruling in the University of Texas case (Hopwood\nv. Texas, 78 F 3d 932 [Fifth Circuit, 1996]) threw a cloud\neven over this small window for affirmative action, boldly asserting\nthat the Bakke holding was now dead as law and that race\ncould not be used at all in admissions. \n\nGiven Justice Powell’s singular opinion, supported by no one else on\nthe Court, and given the drift of Supreme Court decisions on racial\npreferences since\n 1978,[23]\n the Hopwood court was not\noutlandish, if a bit presumptuous, in declaring Powell’s holding in\nBakke dead. As it happened, Powell’s opinion was far from dead.\nIn the University of Michigan Law School case, Grutter v.\nBollinger, eventually decided by the Supreme Court in June 2003,\nJustice Sandra Day O’Connor’s lead opinion declared: “today we\nendorse Justice Powell’s view that student body diversity is a\ncompelling state interest that can justify the use of race in\nuniversity admissions” (Grutter v. Bollinger, 539\nU.S. 306 [2003], at 330).  Diversity was alive after all. But how it\nworked its affirmative action elixir remained as unclear in 2003 as it\nhad been in 1978. \n\nTo see why, consider how in Grutter Justice\nO’Connor posed the issue: \n\nNow, posing the issue this way and allowing the Law School to assert a\nspecial interest in “one particular type of diversity”\ninvites the conflation of general diversity—a diversity\nof opinions, experiences, backgrounds, talents, aspirations, and\nperspectives—with ethnic and racial diversity\nthat Justice Powell appeared strongly to resist. After all, the\nMedical School too had asserted in its defense a similar special\ninterest. \n\nRecall Justice Powell’s principal objection to the Medical School’s\nset-asides. In making the race or ethnicity of an applicant a\n“plus,” a scheme like Harvard’s does \n\nBy contrast, Allan Bakke was not able to compete for all one hundred\nseats at the Medical School; sixteen were reserved for candidates not\nlike him. \n\nIt is Powell’s resistance to this reservation that underpins Justice\nO’Connor’s opinion in Grutter, where she observed: \n\nWhat vindicated the Law School in O’Connor’s eyes was its\n“highly individualized, holistic review of each applicant’s file,\ngiving serious consideration to all the ways an applicant might\ncontribute to a diverse educational\nenvironment” (Grutter, at\n 339).[24]\n This “individualized consideration” is crucial; in\nGratz v.  Bollinger, decided the same day as\nGrutter, Justice O’Connor switched sides to hold\nunconstitutional the undergraduate admissions process at the\nUniversity of Michigan. The undergraduate admissions office operated\ndifferently than the Law School. It computed an index score for each\napplicant by assigning numerical points for academic factors such as\nhigh school grades, admissions test scores, quality of high school,\nstrength of curriculum; and for nonacademic factors such as being a\nresident of Michigan, a child of an alumnus, a recruited athlete, or a\nmember of “an underrepresented minority group.” An\napplicant falling in this last category automatically received 20\n points (Gratz v. Bollinger,\n539 U. S. 244 [2003], at 287).\n In O’Connor’s view, this “mechanical” procedure meant\nthat the undergraduate admissions office did not fully take account in\neach application “of all factors that may contribute to student\nbody\n diversity” (Gratz, at 288).\n  \n\nBut O’Connor’s conclusion here simply draws us back to the lacuna in\nJustice Powell’s Bakke opinion. Why should the undergraduate\nadmissions office take account of all the factors that may\ncontribute to student body diversity if it especially wants to select\nfrom certain parts of the diversity spectrum? Why can’t it, like the\nLaw School, claim a special interest in “one particular type of\ndiversity”? Why bar the undergraduate admissions office from\nusing an effective tool to promote its interest even if the tool is\n“mechanical”? In fact, the Law School’s\n“non-mechanical” procedure differed from the undergraduate\nadmissions policy only on its face, not in its results. During\nadmissions season, the Law School’s director of admissions frequently\nconsulted the “daily reports” that “kept track of\nthe racial and ethnic composition” of the incoming class. He did\nso to make sure a “critical mass” of minority students was\n included (Grutter, at 326).\n In short, the Law School\n“managed” its admissions process so that roughly 6 to 7\npercent of each entering class was African-American. The undergraduate\nadmissions procedure, with its index scores, yielded a similar\n outcome (Grutter, at 367–69 [Rehnquist, dissenting] and 374 [Kennedy,\ndissenting]).\n Only surface appearance distinguished the\ntwo procedures. Justice Scalia called\nthe Law School’s “holistic” admissions process “a\nsham,” and not without\n reason (Grutter, at 375 [Scalia, dissenting]). \n\nAs it turned out, Grutter failed to close the book on\nuniversity affirmative action. A new legal challenge soon arose, this\ntime against the University of Texas, which had revised its own\nadmission program in 2004 to emulate the scheme validated\nin Grutter. The case, Fisher v. Texas, wound its way\nthrough the courts for a decade, twice landing on the steps of the\nSupreme Court before final disposition in 2016. \nJustice Kennedy, writing for the Court, left the Grutter\ndefense of racial preferences intact, essentially retracing Justice\nO’Connor’s opinion. Universities bent upon pursuing the\n“educational benefits that flow from student body\ndiversity,” he wrote, are due a degree of judicial deference\n(Fisher v. University of Texas, 133 S. Ct. 2411, 2419\n[2013]). \nPersuaded that race–neutral policies didn’t allow the\nUniversity fully to succeed in deriving the “educational\nbenefits” of diversity, the Court majority found the\nUniversity’s modest use of race permissible.  \n\nBut despite these legal victories, have universities actually made a\ncase for diversity as the justifying basis for race–conscious\nadmissions? Caught napping in the mid–1990s when the legal\nchallenges began, higher education rushed to put meat on\nthe Bakke bones and turn Justice Powell’s\noff–hand remarks into a full–fledged defense. As the\nUniversity of Michigan cases approached a final test in 2003, the\nSupreme Court was bombarded with scores of\nfriend–of–the–court briefs from business groups,\nmilitary officers, higher education associations, coteries of\nscholars, and other interested parties lauding the benefits of\ndiversity. A similar outpouring preceded the two decisions\nin Fisher v. University of\nTexas.[25] \nConsider some of the claims in these briefs. “[S]tudent body\ndiversity is essential” if universities are to provide\nstudents with “skills necessary for…success in an\nincreasingly globalized world” (Leading Public Research\nUniversities 2015, 11–12; emphasis added). Racial and ethnic\ndiversity on campus are vital to securing a capable\nworkforce; it is  essential that [students] be educated in an\nenvironment where they are exposed to diverse people, ideas,\nperspectives, and interactions (65 Leading American Businesses 2003,\n1, 2; emphasis added). Otherwise, the education of students is\n“degraded” (823 Social Scientists 2015, 5;\nemphasis added). “[S]tudents today must receive direct\nexperience with people of different backgrounds” (American\nCouncil on Education 2015, 6; emphasis added). The\n“only means of obtaining properly qualified employees\nis through diversity at institutions of higher\neducation…[Appropriate] skills can only be developed\nthrough exposure to widely diverse people, culture, ideas, and\nviewpoints” (Fortune 100 and Other Leading Businesses 2013, 3,\n5; emphasis added). “Diversity is an indispensable\nprerequisite to establishing the most productive problem–solving\ngroups” (Social and Organizational Psychologists 2015, 47;\nemphasis added). \n\nAccording to the briefs the positive effects of diversity are\nbountiful. They include “improvements in cognitive abilities,\nanalytical problem solving skills and complex thinking\nskills…[C]ross racial interactions are more strongly linked\nwith cognitive growth than are interactions with non–racial\ndiversity” (American Educational Research Association 2012,\n12). “[R]esearch shows that by increasing diversity, universities can\nhelp their graduates enter society with better problem–solving\ncapabilities than students who are not exposed to diversity” (Social\nand Organizational Psychologists 2015, 37).  \nNow consider four points. First, the promiscuous use of “diversity” in\nthe argument for affirmative action opens the door to waffling and\nequivocation. Students learn through “exposure to widely diverse\npeople, culture, ideas, and viewpoints” announces the Fortune 100\nbrief. Of course. But the issue at hand is racial\ndiversity. Wrapping the latter into the former is not an aid to\nprecision.[26]\nSecond, can we imagine that the University of Michigan or the\nUniversity of Texas would abandon its affirmative action program if\nstudies showed no particular educational benefit to diversity? Suppose\nit turns out that students in general don’t show additional “cognitive\ngrowth” from increased racial diversity. Suppose it turns out students\nwould best prepare for our “increasingly globalized world” by learning\nMandarin Chinese or Spanish. \nThird, the straining by academics to show that cross-racial\ninteraction\nis essential, indispensable, vital, necessary,\nor imperative to a good education, if taken at face value,\nleads to an unpleasant conclusion, namely that a lot of black college\nstudents suffer a deficient education. The young woman who excels at\nDunbar High School in Washington, DC (enrollment 95 % black, 1 %\nwhite) and then gets her Bachelor of Science degree in\nstatistics magna cum laude at Spelman College (enrolling, in\n2017, one white among its 2097 students) is, according to Fortune 100\ncompanies, not the sort of employee they want. Graduates of Fisk\nUniversity (0.7% white) or Tougaloo (0.6% white) or Florida A & M\n(3.5% white) haven’t achieved enough cognitive growth,\nhaven’t sufficiently honed their problem–solving\nskills—is that what we are supposed to conclude? The University\nof Texas (enrolling 25% Hispanics and 5% blacks) contends that without\na “critical mass” of minority students it can’t reap\n“the educational benefits of diversity.” Does this mean\nthat Prairie View University, two hours down the road from Austin and\nenrolling 7% Hispanics and 1.8% whites, has to do without those\nbenefits? Are its students poorly prepared for “our increasingly\ndiverse workforce and society” (Fisher 2016, at 2210,\n2211)? Defenders of affirmative action should think twice about\nclaiming an education in a “non–diverse” setting\nmust be degraded.  \nFourth, there is a noticeable lack of “fit” between university\naffirmative action practices and the diversity rationale (see, for\nexample, Anderson 2002, 27; Anderson 2004, 1217, 1221; Anderson 2010,\n142–143). Race is not treated just like any other special factor\nthat might warrant an admission “plus.” Universities work diligently\nto maintain a relatively constant percentage of black and Hispanic\nenrollees but give variable attention to other of the myriad qualities\nstudents can bring to campus. As one proponent of affirmative action\nnotes, “affirmative action programs…do not look or operate as\nif they were testing for ‘diversity’.” He suggests that many\nsupporters of affirmative action nevertheless disregard this fact,\nbelieving “that there is no harm in [a] miscast reliance on diversity\nbecause, with a wink and a nod, everyone understands that diversity is\nreally a proxy for integration” (Issacharoff 2002, 30, 34;\nemphasis added).  \n\nAlthough the University couched its legal defense in terms of the\n“educational benefits of diversity,” another rationale lay ready at\nhand. The main reason the University of Michigan strives for a\nreasonable representation of minorities on campus is because of the\nway it conceives of its mission: to prepare Michigan’s future\nleaders. \n\nThe argument is straightforward: \n\nThis is the “Michigan Mandate” (Gratz\nv. Bollinger, 135 F. Supp. 2d 790 [2001], at 796–797).\nRacial and ethnic diversity aren’t incidental contributors to a\ndistinct academic mission; they are part of the mission of\nthe University, just as educating young people from Michigan is part\nof it (see Fullinwider and Lichtenberg 2004, 165–188). And\nsomething like a national version of the mandate underlies the\nMichigan Law School’s affirmative action policy, since its\ngraduates move into elite law firms or government service outside\nMichigan (see Lempert et al. 2000, 399; Wilkins 2000,\n530–534). \n\nThis “integration” rationale seems better aligned with the\nactual practice of university affirmative action than the diversity\nrationale. Indeed, in the midst of her nominally Powell-like defense\nof the Law School, Justice O’Connor in Grutter for a\nmoment veered away from the “educational benefits of\ndiversity” to go down a quite different path. Institutions like\nthe University of Michigan and its Law School, she noted,\n“represent the training ground for…our Nation’s\nleaders.” She went on: \n\nThis “legitimacy” argument—not in any way about\nenriching the climate of opinion on campus or improving\nstudents’ complex thinking skills—parallels the simple\nsyllogism set out just above. Justice O’Connor inserted this new\nrationale into the middle of her Grutter\nopinion—inserted it unexpectedly and then abandoned it just as\nquickly to resume tracing the byways of diversity. Justice Kennedy did\nthe same in Fisher (2016, 2211).   \n\nCertainly, something in the spirit of the “Michigan\nMandate” has animated elite universities, including those\nstudied by William Bowen and Derek Bok in The Shape of the River:\nLong-Term Consequences of Considering Race in College and University\nAdmissions. The primary aim of these institutions is not through\nvigorous affirmative action to enhance the liberal learning of their\nstudents (although they welcome this gain for all students). Their\nmain motive for assuring that the percentage of African-Americans and\nHispanics on their campuses is more than token derives from their\nself-conceptions as institutions training individuals who will some\nday take up national and international leadership roles in the\nprofessions, arts, sciences, education, politics, and government\n(Bowen and Bok 1998, 7).  Society, they believe, will be stronger and\nmore just if the ranks of its leading citizens include a racially and\nethnically broader range of people than it does now. Nor are they\nwrong in thinking that the pipeline to local and national elites runs\nthrough top-notch universities. \n\nElizabeth Anderson, in two long essays (2002, 2004), bookending\nthe Grutter decision, makes a thorough and cogent case for\nputting racial integration at the center of conceptions of affirmative\naction. The diversity argument is insufficient, she\nwrites. “Considered as a purely cognitive end, divorced from the\nvalues of democracy and social justice, the ‘robust exchange of\nideas’ cannot support the scope of racial preferences in college\nadmissions” (Anderson 2002, 1221). She goes on: \nThe integrative model of affirmative action offers an alternative\nrationale for race–sensitive admissions that unites educational\nwith democratic and social justice concerns. It begins with a\nrecognition that Americans live in a profoundly segregated society, a\ncondition inconsistent with a fully democratic society and with equal\nopportunity. To achieve the latter goals, we need to\ndesegregate—to integrate, that is—to live together as one\nbody of equal citizens (Anderson 2002, 1222).\n \n\nThe integrative model has several legal advantages over the diversity\nand compensation models of affirmative action. It makes sense of the\nscope and weight that educational institutions actually give to race\nin the admissions process. It thus closes the gap between theory and\npractice that makes affirmative action programs so vulnerable under\nstrict scrutiny. It also shows how race can be directly relevant to a\ncompelling state interest, rather than merely a proxy for something\nelse, such as diversity of opinions (Anderson 2002, 1226).\n \n\nGiven the realities of race in the U.S., people of different races\noccupy different walks of life. So in the U.S., democracy requires\nracial integration of the main institutions of civil society, the\nplaces where discussion of public import among citizens take place:\npublic accommodations, workplaces, schools, and neighborhoods. The\nsame point applies to society’s elites, those who play a pivotal\nrole in formulating and adopting policies of public import. Elites, to\nbe legitimate, must serve a representative function: they must be\ncapable of and dedicated to representing the concerns of people from\nall walks of life, so that the policies they forge are responsive to\nthese concerns. An elite drawn only from segments of society that live\nin isolation from other segments will be ignorant of the circumstances\nand concerns of those who occupy other walks of life (Anderson 2004,\n22).\n \nAnderson sees integration as an end courts can accept, one that\ninforms many past judicial opinions and acts of legislation, and one\ngiven endorsement in Grutter: \n(It is hard to see how Grutter represents a\n“robust” defense of integrative affirmative\naction. Justice O’Connor introduced the “legitimacy”\nargument without prior preparation and left it hanging without further\ndevelopment. Justice Kennedy in Fisher likewise seemed not to\nnotice that the “legitimacy” argument departs considerably\nfrom the diversity rationale he was rehearsing. Nevertheless, there it\nis in the majority opinions, to be seized on and developed by a future\ncourt if it is so disposed.)[27]  \nOther writers, too, have talked about affirmative action in terms\nof integration (Warnke 1998; Estlund 2002; Jacobs 2004; Boddie\n2016).  \n\nThe integration argument, like the diversity argument, is\nstraightforwardly instrumental. It points to hoped-for outcomes of\naffirmative action. If those outcomes don’t materialize, then\naffirmative action’s cause is weakened. Moreover, the little\nintegration syllogism isn’t complete as it stands. It needs to include\nanother premise: that the gains from achieving racially and ethnically\nintegrated classes don’t come at a disproportionate cost. \n\nPerhaps the cost is high, or even too high. Stephan and Abigail\nThernstrom certainly think so. They contend that most of the cost\nfalls on the very persons affirmative action is supposed to benefit.\nUnder-prepared African-Americans are thrown into academic environments\nwhere they cannot succeed (Thernstrom and Thernstrom 1997, 395–411).\nIn the Thernstroms’ view, race-blind admissions policies will result\nin a desirable “cascading,” with African-American and\nHispanic students ending up at colleges and universities where the\nacademic credentials of their fellow students match their\nown. However, the Bowen and Bok study provides some evidence that\ncascading isn’t necessarily a valuable phenomenon. In fact, at the\nschools they studied, the better the institution a student entered,\nwhatever his academic credentials, the more likely he was to graduate,\ngo on to further education, and earn a good\nincome (Bowen and Bok 1998, 63, 114,\n 144). \n\nEven so, the select schools Bowen and Bok studied may be quite\nunrepresentative of the full range of schools that\nresort to racial preferences and the cost-benefit picture that holds\nfor these schools may not hold for the rest. Indeed, the picture drawn\nby Richard Sander in a lengthy review of affirmative action in law\nschools, published in the November 2004 Stanford Law Review,\nlends credence to the Thernstrom’s academic mismatch thesis. Ranking\nlaw schools from best to worst, Sander found that affirmative action\nboosts African-American students 20 or more steps up the ladder,\nputting them in schools with white classmates who possess considerably\nbetter LSAT scores and undergraduate college grades.  The upshot:\n“close to half of black students end up in the bottom tenth of\ntheir classes.” This bad performance yields three bad\nconsequences.  First, African-American students suffer high attrition\nrates.  Second, they fail the bar exam at a high rate (the principal\npredictor of a student’s passing or failing is her grades, not the\nquality of her school).  Third, they suffer a significant employment\npenalty for low grades “in all schools outside the top\nten.” Sander estimates that under a race-blind admissions\nsystem, American law schools would actually create more\nAfrican-American lawyers than they do under affirmative action (Sander\n2004, 449, 460, 478, 479). \n\nSander’s article inspired a flurry of responses disputing his\nmethodology and conclusions (e.g., Ayers and Brooks 2005, Chambers,\net al. 2005, Wilkins 2005, Ho 2005, Barnes 2007, and\nRothstein and Yoon 2008).  Sander replied to his critics (Sander\n2005); other writers found evidence of mismatch effects in educational\ndomains outside law schools (Elliott et al. 1996, Smith and\nMcArdle, 2004, Arcidiacono et al. 2012); yet other scholars\npresented independent confirmation of Sander’s hypothesis\n(Arcidiacono et al. 2011b, Williams 2013), One critic, upon\nre-analysis, had to withdraw her refutation of Sander (Barnes 2007,\nBarnes 2011); and in 2012 Sander joined with co-author Stuart Taylor\nto publish Mismatch, a book-length treatment setting out old\nand new research supporting Sander’s hypothesis. Others continue\nto find the law school mismatch hypothesis dubious and unsupported\n(Camilli and Welner 2011; Camilli and Jackson 2011; Kidder and Lempert\n2015)  \nOther researchers, following the lead of Bowen and Bok, have focused\non undergraduate performance. Fischer and Massey, for example,\nconcluded that though affirmative action has “both positive and\nnegative implications for minority students, [such policies] operate,\non balance, to enhance the academic achievement of minority\nstudents” (Fischer and Massey 2007, 546). In another study,\nMassey and Mooney found “little support for the mismatch\nhypothesis” (Massey and Mooney 2007, 114). Dale and Krueger\ndetermined that “the effect of attending a school with a higher\naverage SAT score is positive for black and Hispanic students”\n(Dale and Krueger 2014, 350). Similarly, Melguizo held:  \n\nOne reason disputes persist about cause and effect is imperfect\ndata. Although often operating with large sets of information,\nresearchers must decide which statistical models most appropriately\ntease out significance, decisions that involve debatable assumptions\nabout filling in missing pieces. Two researchers note that\n“[b]etter data would undoubtedly permit more relevant and\nconvincing analyses of the effects of mismatch and and would\nespecially help to identify any threshold below which potential\nmismatch effects become more probable” (Camilli and Welner 2011,\n500). Much of the back–and–forth about the effects of\naffirmative action could be resolved if educational institutions\ndisclosed information about their admissions processes, student\ngrades, graduation rates, and the like. But institutional resistance\nmakes this unlikely.[28] \n\nThe affirmative action debate throws up many ironies but one in\nparticular should be noted. From the time in 1973 when Judith Jarvis\nThomson conjectured that it was “not entirely\ninappropriate” that white males bear the costs of the\ncommunity’s “making amends” to African-Americans and women\nthrough preferential affirmative action, the affirmative action debate\nhas been distracted by intense quarrels over who deserves\nwhat. Do the beneficiaries of affirmative action deserve\ntheir benefits (Allen 2011)? Do the losers deserve their loss? \n\nChristopher Edley, the White House assistant put in charge of\nPresident Clinton’s review of affirmative action policy in 1994–95,\nspeaks of how, during the long sessions he and his co-workers put in\naround the conference table, the discussion of affirmative action kept\ncircling back to the “coal miner’s son” \n question (I’ve changed the gender for expository purposes). \n\nWhy, indeed? This is a hard question if one defends affirmative action\nin terms of compensatory or distributive justice. If directly doing\njustice is what affirmative action is about, then its mechanisms must\nbe adjusted as best they can to reward individual desert and true\nmerit. The “coal miner’s son” example is meant to throw\ndesert in the defender’s face: here is affirmative action at\nwork thwarting desert, for surely the coal miner’s son—from the\nhard scrabble of Harlan County, say—has lived with far less\nadvantage than the neurosurgeon’s son who, we may suppose, has reaped\nall the advantages of his father’s (or mother’s) standing. Why should\nthe latter get a preference? \n\nA defender might answer in the way that Charles Lawrence and Mari\nMatsuda do in their 1997 book, We Won’t Go Back:\n“All the talk about class, the endless citings of the\n‘poor white male from Appalachia,’ cannot avoid the\nreality of race and gender privilege” (Lawrence and Matsuda\n1997, 190–191). As they see it, because white privilege persists\nracial preferences really do balance the scales. Because male\nprivilege persists, gender preferences really do make selections\nfairer. Lawrence and Matsuda brook no concession: in every case the\nloser in affirmative action is not the more deserving. \n\nEven Justice Brennan tried his hand at this argument, writing in\nBakke: \n\nBakke was not denied anything to which he had moral claim in the\nfirst place.\n \n\nJust as Mary Anne Warren and James Rachels in the 1970s thought that\nthe losers under affirmative action were losing only illicit\nprivileges, and the gainers merely gaining what should have been theirs\nto start with, so Michel Rosenfeld in the 1990s, in his extended\n“dialogic” defense of affirmative action, echoes the same\nthought: \n\nHowever, programs that give blanket preferences by race or gender are\nhardly “precisely tailored” to match desert and reward\nsince, as Lawrence and Matsuda themselves acknowledge at one place,\nthe white male “privilege” is “statistical”\n(Lawrence and Matsuda 1997, 252).  Yet it is individuals, not\nstatistical averages, who gain or lose in admissions determinations\nand employment selections.[29] \n\nThe persistence of this strategy of defense reflects a residual\nfeeling that the fruits of affirmative action are somehow spoiled if they are\nnot deserved (Harris 2003). Nevertheless, it is the wrong strategy for defending\nreal world affirmative action. The programs legitimated under the\nCivil Rights Act, in both their nonpreferential and preferential\nforms, had—and have—a clear aim: to change institutions so\nthat they can meet the nondiscrimination mandate of the Act. Selection\nby race or gender was—and is—a means to such change. To\nthe extent that such selection also compensates individuals for past\nwrongs or puts people in places they really deserve, these are\nincidental by-products of a process aimed at something else. \n\nThe same is true with university admissions policy. When the Medical\nSchool of the University of California at Davis offered four reasons\nin defense of the special admissions program that left Bakke on the\noutside, none of these reasons said anything about matching admissions\nand desert. The criteria of the special admissions program—race\nand ethnicity—were instruments to further ends: integrating the\nclassroom, the profession, and the delivery of medical services, and\nbreaking the chain of self-reproducing societal discrimination.\nLikewise, when the University of Michigan and the University of Texas\ndefended their programs they pointed not to desert rewarded but\neducational value generated. \n\nNow, if the neurosurgeon’s son because of his race can\nadvance each of these goals and the coal miner’s son, because of\nhis race, cannot, then isn’t the selection decision easy? Pick\nthe African-American neurosurgeon’s son (however advantaged\nhe may be) over the\nwhite coal miner’s son (even if he is the\nmost deserving creature imaginable). The aims of real world\naffirmative action make race and ethnicity (and sometimes gender)\nsalient, not personal desert or merit. The test of real world\naffirmative action lies in the urgency of its ends (preventing\ndiscrimination, promoting diversity or integration) and the aptness\n(moral and causal) of its means (racial, ethnic, and gender\npreferences).  Both remain much in dispute.\n","contact.mail":"rfullinwider@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
