Natural selection requires\nvariation in a population of organisms. For the process to work, at\nleast some of that variation must be heritable and passed on to\norganisms’ descendants in some way. That variation is acted upon\nby the struggle for existence, a process that in effect\n“selects” variations conducive to the survival and\nreproduction of their bearers. Much like breeders choose which of\ntheir animals will reproduce and thereby create the various breeds of\ndomesticated dogs, pigeons, and cattle, nature effectively\n“selects” which animals will breed and creates\nevolutionary change just as breeders do. Such “selection”\nby nature, natural selection, occurs as a result of the struggle for\nexistence and, in the case of sexual populations, the struggle for\nmating opportunities. That struggle is itself the result of checks on\nthe geometric population increase that would occur in the absence of\nthe checks. All populations, even slow-breeding ones such as those of\nelephants, will increase in size in the absence of limitations on\ngrowth that are imposed by nature. These checks take different forms\nin different populations. Such limitations may take the form of\nlimited food supply, limited nesting sites, predation, disease, harsh\nclimactic conditions, and much else besides. One way or another, only\nsome of the candidate reproducers in natural populations actually do\nreproduce, often because others simply die before maturity. Owing to\nthe variations among the candidate reproducers, some have better\nchances of making it into the sample of actual reproducers than do\nothers. If such variations are heritable, the offspring of those with\nthe “beneficial” traits will be likely to produce\nespecially many further descendants themselves. To use one of\nDarwin’s own examples, wolves with especially long legs that\nallow them to run more quickly will be more likely to catch prey and\nthereby avoid starvation and so produce offspring that have especially\nlong legs that allow them, in turn, to breed and produce still more\nlong-legged descendants, and so on. By means of this iterative\nprocess, a trait conducive to reproduction that is initially found in\none or a few population members will spread through the\npopulation.\n\n\nMultiple bouts of Darwin’s process involving different traits,\nacting sequentially or in concert, may then explain both how\nspeciation and the evolution of complex adaptations occur through the\ngradual evolution (change over time) of natural populations. Darwin\naimed to convince his audience that even such structures as the\nvertebrate eye, which at first seem explicable only as the product of\ndesign, could instead be explained by incremental, directional\nevolution, a complex but still naturalistic process (Darwin 1859: ch.\n6). What is initially a light sensitive patch may be transformed into\nan eye by means of a great many bouts of selection that gradually\nimprove and enhance its sensitivity. Showing that something is\nexplicable is importantly different from explaining it (Lennox 1991);\nstill, a theory must be an explanatory sort of theory for it to\naccomplish either task. After Darwin, the appearance of novel species\nin the geological record and the existence of designed-appearing\nadaptations cannot be used as grounds for invoking supernatural causes\nas a matter of last explanatory resort.\n\nNatural selection is chiefly discussed in two different ways among\ncontemporary philosophers and biologists. One usage, the\n“focused” one, aims to capture only a single element of\none iteration of Darwin’s process under the rubric\n“natural selection”, while the other, the\n“capacious” usage, aims to capture a full cycle under the\nsame rubric. These are clearly alternative, non-competing uses of the\nterm, and distinct philosophical controversies surround each one. This\nsection distinguishes these two uses and the following two sections\nare dedicated to the debates that surround each one. Sections 4 and 5\nconsider how natural selection connects to explanation and causation.\n \nIn Darwin’s wake, theorists have developed formal, quantitative\napproaches to modeling Darwin’s process. The\n“focused” usage of natural selection finds its home as an\ninterpretation of a single term in some of these formalisms (and only\nsome of them). Below, we will consider two formal approaches, type\nrecursions and the Price Equation, elements of which have been\ninterpreted as quantifying selection. In the Price Equation, the\ncovariance of offspring number and phenotype is interpreted as\nquantifying selection; in type recursions, fitness variables (or,\nequivalently, selection coefficients) are interpreted as quantifying\nselection. What makes these interpretations focused is that they\nquantify only a single element of Darwin’s process using the\nnotion natural selection; other facets of Darwin’s process are\nhandled in other ways. So, in type recursions for instance, type\nfrequency variables quantify how the population varies, and\n“spontaneous” variations are quantified by mutation\nparameters. Similarly, in the Price Equation, inheritance is captured\nby a different term than the term that is interpreted as quantifying\nnatural selection. The point is that each formal apparatus as a whole\nis understood to capture Darwin’s process, while only a single\nelement of that apparatus is said to refer to natural selection. \nSome philosophers’ definitions of natural selection are clearly\nintended to capture this focused usage of the term. Millstein, for\ninstance, characterizes selection as a discriminate sampling process\n(Millstein 2002: 35). Otsuka identifies natural selection with the\ncausal influence of traits on offspring number in causal-graphical\nmodels (Otsuka 2016: 265). Okasha interprets the covariance of\noffspring number and offspring phenotype as quantifying the causal\ninfluence of selection (Okasha 2006: 28) Clearly, these uses of\n“natural selection” are meant to capture only an element\nof Darwin’s process; they make no mention of inheritance or\nreplication. As discussed further below, controversies over the\nfocused notion of selection have to do with whether the focused notion\nof selection can be distinguished from that of drift\n (section 3),\n and whether selection, in the focused sense, should be counted as a\ncause\n (section 5). \nThe alternative, “capacious”, usage of the notion of\nnatural selection is to capture Darwin’s process in its\nentirety, rather than a single contributor to it. Because\nDarwin’s process is cyclical, specifying what is sufficient for\na single cycle of it, a single instance of, say, replication of genes\nfor long legs caused by long-legged wolves making narrow captures, is\nsufficient to specify a process that may explain adaptation and\nspeciation. This is true, anyway, when it is added that the process\ngets repeated. The capacious notion, capturing a cycle of\nDarwin’s process, is used by Lewontin and later authors working\nin the same vein, who put forward conditions for evolution by natural\nselection: these include variation, inheritance, and reproduction.\nWhile falling within the scope of “natural selection” in\nthe capacious sense used by Lewontin, these elements of Darwin’s\nprocess are treated as distinct from natural selection when that\nnotion is used in its focused sense. \nPhilosophers and biologists have been concerned to state the\nconditions for evolution by natural selection, many because they take\nit that there is a single theory, evolutionary theory, that governs\nDarwin’s process. In many ways, the attempt to state the\nconditions for natural selection is a typical philosophical\nundertaking. We know, for instance, that confirmatory evidence may be\nused to raise our confidence in what it confirms and this recognition\nspawns a debate over what, exactly, should count as confirmation (see\nentry on\n confirmation).\n Similarly, Darwin’s theory shows how some natural phenomena may\nbe explained (including at least adaptations and speciation), and thus it is a\nsimilar philosophical concern to state exactly when the deployment of\nthe theory is licensed. Such a statement would then issue in a verdict\non what, beyond the phenomena targeted by Darwin, is equally explicable\nusing his theory. Such a verdict could be used to arbitrate whether\nthe spread of cultural variations, “memes”, is genuinely\nexplicable using the theory, as Dawkins (1982) suggested. The\nmammalian immune system may equally involve dynamics that are\nexplicable as selection processes (see section 4.1 of the entry on\n replication and reproduction).\n Zurek (2009) has even defended using the theory to explain phenomena\nin quantum mechanics. \nHere are the three principles that form the “logical\nskeleton” of “Darwin’s argument”, according to\nLewontin (1970: 1): \nLewontin’s principles invoke, implicitly or explicitly, a number\nof causal processes, including development, reproduction, survival,\nand inheritance. Though it is controversial whether Lewontin succeeds,\nclearly his three principles aim to capture at least what is\nsufficient for a cycle of evolutionary change by natural selection,\nsomething which, if repeated, could be used to explain adaptation and\nspeciation. \nLewontin’s 1970 statement of the requirements for selection\nshould be contrasted with a similar statement in a later work, in\nwhich that author once again states that “the theory of\nevolution by natural selection” rests on three principles: \nDifferent individuals within a species differ from one another in\nphysiology, morphology, and behavior (the principle of variation); the\nvariation is in some way heritable, so that on the average offspring\nresemble their parents more than they resemble other individuals (the\nprinciple of heredity); different variants leave different numbers of\noffspring either immediately or in remote generations (the principle\nof natural selection). (Lewontin 1978: 220) \nThis later statement is in many ways similar to the earlier one, but\nthere are some crucial differences in the formulations. According to\nthe later article, the different individuals must be within the same\nspecies, and it is phenotypic variations, rather than fitness, that\nmust be inherited. Many authors have echoed Lewontin’s\ninfluential principles (see Godfrey-Smith (2007) for a thorough\nreview); for markedly different approach to formalizing the theory,\nsee Tennant (2014)). \nLewontin’s conditions have been criticized from many directions.\nFor one thing, they make no mention of the populations in which\nselection occurs, and though the second set of conditions refers to\nspecies, all the members of a single species may not form a single\npopulation for the purposes of applying selection theory. Populations\nmust be appropriately circumscribed for some of the key vocabulary of\nevolutionary theory (focused selection, drift) to be deployed in a\nnon-arbitrary fashion (Millstein 2009). Lewontin’s formulations\nalso make no mention of the struggle for existence, a seminal notion\nfor Darwin (see discussion in Lennox & Wilson 1994). The\nprinciples have also been subject to counterexamples. On the one hand,\nauthors put forward cases of evolving populations that fail to meet\nLewontin’s conditions. Earnshaw-White (2012) puts forward a\npopulation in which offspring do not inherit their parents’\ntraits, but whose members exhibit differential survival such that the\npopulation will evolve to a stable equilibrium. Equally, differential\nheritability may lead to evolutionary change without differential\nfitness (Earnshaw-White 2012; but see Bourrat 2015). Despite failing\nto meet Lewontin’s conditions, populations will evolve that\nfeature variants that differ not in average offspring number, but only\nin generation time, such that one variant reproduces twice as fast as\nthe other (Godfrey-Smith 2007: 495). On the other hand, authors put\nforward cases of systems that fail to evolve despite meeting\nLewontin’s conditions. A system exhibiting stabilizing\nselection, such that it tends to evolve toward an equilibrium state\nwhere multiple variants remain within the population, may meet either\nset of Lewontin’s conditions despite failing to evolve\n(Godfrey-Smith 2007: 504). Counterexamples of these sorts depend upon\nthe assumption that we can tell whether a system is undergoing\nselection without applying any set of criteria for doing so (see\nJantzen 2019 for a discussion of how a Lewontin-style approach to\nwhether a system undergoes selection is question-begging). \nOkasha makes an important point about the intransitivity of covariance\nthat is relevant to Lewontin’s principles. Okasha writes that Lewontin’s last two conditions essentially require covariance\nbetween offspring number and parental character (Principle 2), along\nwith covariance between parental character and offspring character\n(Principle 3). (Here, Okasha is interpreting “fitness” in\nLewontin’s conditions as offspring number rather than as a\nvariable in a formalism quantifying selection in its focused sense.)\nBoth those last two covariances might be positive without the system\nexhibiting an evolutionary response (as would occur if some of the\nparents with a given character have especially many offspring that do\nnot especially resemble them, while other parents with the same\ncharacter have offspring that especially resemble them but do not have\nespecially many of them). For a system to exhibit an evolutionary\nresponse, Okasha requires that the covariance between parental\noffspring number and average offspring character be positive (2006:\n37). \nOkasha’s alternative condition is intended to replace a pair of\nLewontin’s principles. Interestingly, Okasha further differs\nfrom Lewontin in allowing that systems that do not evolve may meet his\nrequirements. A system in which selection is exactly offset by\ntransmission bias will not evolve but will undergo natural selection,\naccording to Okasha (2006: 39). \nAn alternative approach to stating conditions for natural selection\ninvolves attention to replicators, of which genes are the paradigm\ninstance. This approach was motivated by the discovery of genetic\nvariations that spread despite not being conducive to the\nreproduction of the organisms that bear them, for instance, genes that\nexhibit meiotic drive. Replicator selectionism, which makes\ngenes/replicators the units of selection, was developed in contrast\nwith the Lewontin-style approaches, which make larger entities,\norganisms and even species, units of selection (see entry on\n units and levels of selection). \nDawkins defines replicators as anything in the universe of which\ncopies are made (1982: 82). Hull has a similar definition: a\nreplicator is an entity that passes on its structure largely intact in\nsuccessive replications (Hull 1988: 408). Germ-line replicators have\nthe potential to have indefinitely many descendants; they contrast\nwith somatic replicators, the genes found in body cells, which produce\ncopies only as part of mitosis and whose lineages of descendants end\nwhen the body dies. Active replicators have some causal influence on\ntheir probability of being copied in contrast to inactive,\n“neutral” ones, which do not have any effects on\ndevelopment. Natural selection will occur wherever we find active\ngerm-line replicators (Dawkins 1982: 83). Dawkins distinguished\nreplicators from vehicles, his notion meant to replace and generalize\nthat of organism. Hull proposed the notion of interactor as a similar\ncomplement to the notion of replicator. Neither notion, however, is\nmeant to further delineate the circumstances in which selection\noccurs, or to narrow the scope of application of evolutionary theory\n(for further discussion of these notions, see entry on\n units and levels of selection).\n This is evident, for Hull at least, insofar as genes may be both\nreplicators and interactors (1988: 409).  \nThe view that evolutionary theory is a theory that applies to active\ngerm-line replicators has come under fire from a multitude of\ndirections. Genes need not be germ-line to undergo selection, as it is\nat least arguable that the immune system exhibits selection processes\n(Okasha 2006: 11). Copying is beside the point, since only similarity\nacross generations, rather than identity, is necessary for\nevolutionary change (Godfrey-Smith 2000, 2007 and entries on\n units and levels of selection\n and\n replication and reproduction).\n For his part, Hull seems to agree with this last point, as he allows\nthat organisms might well count as replicators, at least in cases in\nwhich they reproduce asexually (Hull 2001: 28–29). \nDespite the bevy of attacks on replicator selectionism, replicator\nselectionists have not, to my knowledge at least, been criticized for\nbeing too permissive and allowing that systems that do not evolve\ncount as undergoing selection. But germ-line replicators may exert a\ncausal influence on their probability of being copied without\nspreading in a natural population as a result, as in some cases of\nfrequency-dependent selection of systems already at equilibrium. In\ncases of frequency-dependent selection, variant genes cause their own\nreproduction, but the extent of influence on reproduction is a\nfunction of their frequency. Suppose each type spreads when it is\nrarer. At 50% frequency, the influences of each gene on reproduction\ncancel each other out, and a stable intermediate frequency is the\nresult (for a case of a natural system that behaves this way, see Hori\n1993). Because causing replication may not lead to differential\nreplication in these and other cases, replicator selectionists do not\neffectively take evolution to be necessary for selection while\nLewontin and those who follow his basic approach typically do do\nso. \nOne natural way to arbitrate the issue of whether systems that undergo\nselection must evolve is to attend to the point of statements of\nprinciples of natural selection, or statements of the requirements for\nselection. Many theorists take it that the point of these principles\nis to set out the scope of a theory in the special sciences that deals\nwith selection and evolution, evolutionary theory. Lewontin claims\nthat the theory of evolution by natural selection rests on his three\nprinciples (1978: 220). Equally, Godfrey-Smith claims that statements\nof conditions for evolution by natural selection exhibit the coherence\nof evolutionary theory and capture some of its core principles (2007:\n489). Finally, Maynard-Smith (1991) offered a statement of conditions\nfor selection that include evolution as a necessary component, calling\nthe theory so delineated, “Darwin’s theory”. For\nthese writers, the (or at least a) point of the principles\nseems to be to capture the domain of application of the theory we have\ninherited from Darwin. \nDarwin would have been surprised to hear that his theory of natural\nselection was circumscribed so as to apply only to evolving\npopulations. He himself constructed an explanation of a persistent\npolymorphism, heterostyly, using his own theory. Plants exhibiting\nheterostyly develop two, or sometimes three, different forms of flower\nwhose reproductive organisms vary in a number of ways, principally\nlength. Some plants exhibit different forms of flower on the same\nplant, while some are dimorphic and trimorphic, with only one sort of\nflower per plant. Darwin interpreted the flower variations as\nconducive to intercrossing, which he thought was beneficial, at least\nfor many organisms. Populations should not evolve directionally such\nthat a single form of flower spreads throughout the population;\ninstead, multiple variants should be retained, a polymorphism. Darwin\nthinks it clear that heterostyly is an adaptation:  \nThe benefit which heterostyled dimorphic plants derive from the\nexistence of the two forms is sufficiently obvious [….] Nothing\ncan be better adapted for this end than the relative positions of the\nanthers and stigmas in the two forms. (Darwin 1877: 30; thanks to Jim\nLennox for this reference)  \nEven though the population is not evolving, but instead remaining the\nsame over time, it exhibits an adaptation that consists in this\npersistent lack of change, an adaptation that Darwin thought\nexplicable using his theory. For a more recent and especially\ncompelling case of a selectionist explanation of a polymorphism, see\nBayliss, Field, and Moxon’s selectionist explanation of a\nfimbriae polymorphism produced by contingency genes (Bayliss, Field,\n& Moxon 2001). \nDarwin thought his theory could explain a lack of evolution, and\nDarwinists in Darwin’s wake have explained not only stable\npolymorphisms, but unstable ones, cyclical behaviors, protected\npolymorphisms, and a variety of other behaviors that differ from\nsimple directional evolution. These sorts of behaviors result from\nspecific assignments of values for theoretical parameters in many of\nthe very same models that are used to explain simple directional\nselection (where a single variant spreads throughout a population, as\nin the wolf case discussed in the introduction). The point is that\nsystems seemingly governed by evolutionary theory exhibit a variety of\ndifferent sorts of dynamics, and this variety includes both different\nsorts of evolution, including at least cyclical and directional, as well\nas a lack of evolution at all, as in cases of stabilizing\nselection. \nConsider in particular how the difference between stabilizing and\ndirectional selection in the simplest deterministic models of diploid\nevolution lies in the value of a single parameter in the genotypic\nselection model, heterozygote fitness: \nwhere \nIn the above simple, “deterministic” models, if we set the\nfitness parameters such that \\(w_{D} > w_{H} > w_{R},\\) the\n\\(A\\) allele spreads throughout the population, together with\nwhatever traits it causes. Suppose we include within the purview of\nDarwin’s theory models of this sort, together with the systems\nthey (approximately) govern. If we change the value of the fitness\ncoefficients such that \\(w_{D} < w_{H} > w_{R},\\) the system\nwill exhibit a different sort of dynamics. It will evolve to an\nequilibrium point, where there exist some \\(A\\) alleles as well as\nsome \\(a\\) alleles in the population, and remain there, resulting\nin a stable polymorphism. If we hold evolution as a condition for\nselection, we will issue the curious ruling that a system governed by\nthe first sort of model falls within the scope of evolutionary theory\nwhile a system governed by the second sort of model only does so up\nuntil it reaches a stable intermediate state but then no longer.\nMoreover, populations exhibiting stable polymorphisms resulting from\nheterozygote superiority, or overdominance, are just one case among\nmany different sorts of systems that equally exhibit stable\npolymorphisms. \nConsider further that it is more realistic for systems’ dynamics\nto be a function of effective population size in the binomial sampling\nequation, as well as fitness. The above models are deterministic,\nwhile the dynamics of natural systems are to some extent random. A\nmore realistic systems of equations, one capturing the randomness\ninvolved in evolutionary change, would feed the \\(p'\\) value issued by\nthe above equations into the binomial sampling equation by making \\(p'\n= j\\): \nwhere \\(x_{ij}\\) is the probability of \\(i\\) \\(A\\) alleles in\nthe next generation given \\(j\\) \\(A\\) alleles in this\ngeneration, and \\(N\\) is effective population size. A system\ngoverned by both the deterministic equations and the binomial sampling\nequation is said to undergo drift; all natural systems do so. (For\nmore on drift, effective population size, and randomness in\nevolutionary theory, see entry on\n genetic drift).\n A system exhibiting heterozygote superiority whose dynamics are a\nfunction of the binomial sampling equation will not simply rest at its\nstable intermediate frequency but will hover around it, in some\ngenerations evolving toward it, more rarely evolving away, and in some\ngenerations exhibiting no evolution at all. Which of these cases are\ncases in which the system undergoes natural selection in the capacious\nsense? That is, which cases are cases in which the system falls within\nthe purview of evolutionary theory? A natural answer is all of them.\nTo answer in this way, however, we must not make evolution necessary\nfor natural selection. If we do make evolution necessary, we issue the\nverdict that systems governed by the above systems of equations\nsometimes fall within this purview of evolutionary theory and\nsometimes fall outside it, on a generation to generation basis,\ndespite being governed the whole time by a single same system of\nequations, ones undeniably developed as an outgrowth of Darwin’s\ninitial theorizing. \nThis last pattern of argument can be extended. Indeed, given that\nevery natural system undergoing selection also undergoes drift,\nevolutionary theory is arguably applicable also to systems that\nundergo drift even in the absence of selection (in the focused sense).\nGradually reduce the importance of focused selection in the above\nsystem of equations, that is, gradually reduce the differences between\n\\(w_{D}\\), \\(w_{H}\\), and \\(w_{R}\\). Is the point at which the values\nequalize so momentous that it marks the point at which systems\ngoverned by the equations cease to fall within the purview of one\ntheory and instead fall within the purview of another? Does\nKimura’s neutral theory of genetic polymorphism belong in a\ndifferent theory than does Ohta’s (1973) competing nearly\nneutral theory? Brandon (2006) argues that the principle of drift is\nbiology’s first law, writing that neutral evolution is to\nevolutionary theory what inertia is to Newtonian mechanics: both being\nthe natural or default states of the systems to which they apply. If\nBrandon is right, then conditions for the application of evolutionary\ntheory must not even include conditions for selection in the focused\nsense, much less conditions for evolutionary change. \nThe point of stating conditions for evolution by natural selection\nneed not be to state the conditions of deployment of a particular\ntheory in the special sciences. Godfrey-Smith mentions that the\nprinciples may be important to discussions of extensions of\nevolutionary principles to new domains. Statements of the conditions\nfor evolution by natural selection might have value for other reasons.\nBut evolutionary theory is, despite the name, at least arguably a\ntheory that is applicable to more systems than just those that evolve,\nas the replicator selectionists would have it. \nOne of the two chief uses of the notion of natural selection is as an\ninterpretation of one or another quantity in formal models of\nevolutionary processes; this is the focused sense distinguished above.\nTwo different quantities are called selection in different formal\nmodels widely discussed by philosophers. On the one hand, fitness\ncoefficients are said to quantify selection in type recursion models\nof selection; the \\(w\\)’s in the above genotypic selection\nmodel are fitness coefficients. This is standard textbook usage (Rice\n2004; Hedrick 2011). The recursive structure of these models is\nimportant. They can be used to infer how a system will behave into the\nfuture (though of course only if causes of the variables in the system\ndo not change their values in dynamically-relevant ways that are not\nexplicitly modeled in the recursive equations). At their simplest,\ntype recursions make system dynamics a function of fitness\ncoefficients weighting type frequencies/numbers together with\neffective population size (quantifying drift), as in the genotypic\nselection model discussed above. More complex variants of type\nrecursions include frequency-dependent selection models, for cases in\nwhich population members’ fitness is a function of the type\nfrequency variables; density-dependent selection models, for cases in\nwhich fitness is a function of population size; spatially and\ntemporally variable selection models, for cases in which fitness\nvaries as a function of a varying environmental variable that\ninteracts with type differences, and many more. Writers working with\ntype recursion models have developed explicit interpretations of their\ntheoretical terms, including the fitness variables quantifying\nselection. So, for instance, Beatty and Millstein defend the view that\nthe fitness coefficients representing selection in type recursions\nshould be understood as modeling a discriminate sampling process,\nwhile drift, controlled by effective population size, should be\nunderstood as indiscriminate sampling (Beatty 1992; Millstein\n2002). \nPhilosophers have also contended that particular terms in models of\nsystems featuring the formation of groups (or collectives) should be\nunderstood as quantifying the influence of selection at different\nlevels. So, some type recursions of systems involving groups feature\n“group fitness” or “collective fitness”\nparameters, ones analogous to individual or particle fitness\nparameters. Kerr and Godfrey-Smith (2002) discuss one such system of\nrecursions; Jantzen (2019) defends an alternative parameterization of\ngroup selection as part of different system of equations. (See also\nKrupp 2016 for causal-graphical conceptualization of the notion of\ngroup selection.) For much more on multi-level selection, see entry on\n units and levels of selection. \nThe other formal model of particular interest to philosophers is the\nPrice Equation. The Price Equation represents the extent of evolution\nin a system with respect to a given trait across a single generation\nusing statistical functions: \nwhere \nIn the Price Equation, selection is associated with the first\nright-hand side quantity, while the second represents transmission\nbias. \nIdentities among algebraic functions of statistical functions make\npossible the mathematical manipulation of the Price Equation such that\nit may feature a variety of different quantities. As with type\nrecursions, quantities in various transformations of the Price\nEquation are equated with selection at different levels for different\nsystems; Okasha, following Price, treats the covariance of the fitness\nof collectives with the phenotype of collectives as collective-level\nselection, while the average of the within-collective covariances\nbetween particle character and particular fitness is identified with\nparticle-level selection. The persistence of altruistic variants in\nnatural populations has been explained as the result of the\nstabilizing conflict between selection at these different levels\n(Sober & Wilson 1998; and again see entry on\n units and levels of selection.\n The Price Equation can equally be manipulated to yield distinct\nnotions of inheritance; Bourrat distinguishes temporal, persistence,\nand generational heritabilities and argues for the temporal notion as\nappropriate for the purposes of stating conditions for evolution by\nnatural selection (Bourrat 2015).  \nThe distinction between type recursions and the Price Equation is\nimportant, because selection is interpreted differently in each. The\ntwo formalisms will issue in different verdicts about whether, and the\nextent to which, focused selection operates within a single system. If\nwe fix upon a single natural system, and ask how selection operates\nwithin it, we will get different answers if we associate selection\nwith fitness variables in type recursions rather than\n\\(\\textrm{Cov}(w_{i},z_{i})\\) in the Price Equation. To see this,\nconsider how type recursions are structured such that inferences about\ndynamics over multiple generations may be made by means of them. If\nfitness coefficients in these models quantify selection, and these\ntake fixed values (as they do in the genotypic selection model\nconsidered above and a great many others), then the extent of\nselection will remain the same over the time period governed by the\nmodel: the fitness variables remain at fixed values so selection\nremains an unchanging influence. But, in just the same cases, the\nvalue of \\(\\textrm{Cov}(w_{i},z_{i})\\) in the Price Equation will\nchange across generations as the system evolves: the covariance\nfunction in the Price Equation will be highest at intermediate\nfrequencies, when evolution proceeds quickly, and lowest at liminal\nones, when evolution goes more slowly. Consider, for instance, the\nextent to which the population evolves, according to the genotypic\nselection model above, when the following values are plugged into the\nmodel: \nIn that case, the frequency of the \\(A\\) alleles moves from 0.9 to\n0.92 across a single generation; there is some covariance between\n\\(A\\) types and reproduction. Inputting \\(p = 0.5,\\) and\n\\(q = 0.5,\\) the frequency change is greater, \\(A\\) types go\nfrom being half the population to frequency 0.56, and the covariance\nbetween offspring production and being an \\(A\\) type is\ncorrespondingly greater as well. \nTo see even more starkly how what is called selection in the Price\nEquation differs from what is called selection in type recursions,\nconsider a system exhibiting heterozygote superiority like the one\nfrom earlier, where \\(w_{D} = w_{R} < w_{H}.\\) Recall that a system\nof this sort will evolve to a stable equilibrium (provided drift is\nidealized away). Using the recursive equations above, the reader can\ninput values that meet the constraint that heterozygotes have the\nhighest fitness, set \\(p' = p,\\) and compute the stable equilibrium\nvalue for \\(p\\), the frequency of the \\(A\\) alleles. If we\nunderstand selection as quantified by the fitness coefficients in this\nsort of set-up, then the whole time, selection operates in a constant\nfashion, since the fitness coefficients remain fixed. In particular,\nthe operation of selection is the same when the system is evolving\ntoward its stable equilibrium as when it remains at that stable\nequilibrium. By contrast, the covariance term in Price Equation model\nof the system will diminish in value until it reaches zero as the\nsystem evolves to its equilibrium state. When selection is identified\nwith the covariance between type and reproduction, the frequency of\nthe different types matters to the extent of selection. When selection\nis identified with fitness variables in type recursions, the frequency\nof different types has no influence on the extent of selection in the\nsystem. Thus, the different interpretations of selection that\ncorrespond to different quantities in different formal models are\nactually incompatible. We should expect, then, at least one of these\ninterpretations of selection to fail, since focused selection cannot\nbe two different things at once, at least if what counts as natural\nselection is non-arbitrary. \nOne way to reconcile these competing interpretations of selection is\nto make first right-hand side term in the Price Equation quantify\nthe extent of the influence of selection in a system. If we\nassume that focused selection accounts for whatever covariance exists\nbetween parental offspring number and phenotype, then we may treat the\nfirst right-hand side term of the Price Equation as a measure of the\nextent of the influence of focused selection, at least at a given type\nfrequency (see Okasha 2006: 26). This approach puts the logical house\nin order, allowing for a univocal concept of selection, but it does so\nat the expense of other commitments. To note just one, the Price\nEquation will no longer be causally interpretable, since its\nquantities may no longer be said to represent causes (but instead\nmeasure the extents of their influences given further limiting\nassumptions). There exists a sizable literature on which of multiple\nalternative manipulations of the Price Equation represents the actual\ncausal structure of different sorts of system (see Okasha 2016 and\n section 5\n below for more on this issue). \nIt was noted earlier that if what counts as selection is\nnon-arbitrary, then it cannot be the case that what is quantified by\nthe \\(w\\)’s in type recursions and the covariance of\noffspring number and phenotype both count as selection. A substantial\ndebate has arisen over the question of whether what counts as\nselection is indeed non-arbitrary. In particular, some philosophers\ndubbing themselves “statisticalists” have challenged the\nnon-arbitrary character of the distinction, claiming that it is\nmodel-relative (Walsh, Lewens, & Ariew 2002; Walsh 2004, 2007;\nWalsh, Ariew, & Matthen 2017). (For more on the arbitrariness of\nthe selection/drift distinction, see entry on\n genetic drift).\n A related issue, discussed in the subsequent section, concerns the\ncausal interpretability of the theory: Advocates of the non-arbitrary\ncharacter of selection also typically treat selection and drift not\nonly as non-arbitrary quantities, but also as causes, while those who\nallege that the distinction is arbitrary typically equally challenge\nthe treatment of selection and drift as causes.  \nThere exists very little discussion of formal models in statisticalist\nwritings; various toy scenarios are put forward instead, and these are\nnot analyzed using the techniques of formal population genetics\n(Matthen & Ariew 2002; Walsh, Lewens, & Ariew 2002; Walsh\n2007; Walsh, Ariew, & Matthen 2017). When biologically realistic\nscenarios are discussed, systems of equations for inferring how such\nsystems behave are not made part of the discussion (for more on\npopulation genetics, see entry on\n population genetics).\n We consider next a case they discuss because it provides a way of\ncontrasting how the contrast between selection and drift is made in\ntype recursions and how it is made in the Price Equation. There is a\nsort of arbitrariness here, but it emerges only from analysis of a\nhypothetical system using population genetics modeling techniques. \nIn a recent paper, Walsh, Ariew, and Matthen put forward a case of\ntemporally variable selection and claim that it could be treated as a\ncase either of selection or of drift (2017). The case is of a\ndiscrete-generation system with yearly reproduction in which each of\ntwo types of organisms produce different numbers of offspring\ndepending on whether the year is warm or cold, with each type of year\nbeing equally probable: the H types produce 6 offspring in warm years\nwhile the T types produce 4, and the reverse holds for cold years. The\nauthors take the position that the system “looks like”\nboth a case of selection and a case of drift, but without\nconsideration of any formal model of it. Instead, we are invited to\nthink it is a case of selection because the fitnesses of the different\ntypes vary year-to-year; we are invited to think it is a case of drift\nbecause, allegedly, over long stretches of time the two types have\nequal fitnesses and we should, allegedly, predict no net increase in\nfrequency for either type (Walsh, Ariew, & Matthen 2017:\n12–13). \nThe scenario is illuminating because it involves randomness that\ncannot be quantified by effective population size in a type recursion\nbut can be quantified as such by the drift parameter in Price\nEquation. When deploying type recursions, we must treat cases of\ntemporally variable selection as cases of selection, but we are under\nno similar constraint when it comes to the Price Equation. \nThe dynamics of the warm/cold system cannot be inferred from a type\nrecursion in which fitness coefficients are set equal and\nnext-generation frequencies are determined entirely by the\n“drift” term, effective population size in the binomial\nsampling equation. When fitnesses are equal, the frequency of each\ntype is determined solely by the binomial sampling equation above\n(since post-selection frequency, the input to the sampling equation,\nis just pre-selection frequency). Such a determination makes\nnext-generation frequency a normal, bell-shaped distribution whose\nmean is the initial frequency of the types in the system. The\ndistribution of next-generation frequencies in the warm/cold system\ndoes not look like this. The type recursions for the warm/cold system\nmust be calculated using a temporally variable selection model: \nwhere \nWhat is inputted into the binomial sampling equation, \\(p'\\), when the\ndynamics of the system are calculated using the temporally variable\nselection model is never the same as what is inputted into the\nbinomial sampling equation when the dynamics of the system are treated\nas solely a function of drift. In the latter case, the input into the\nequation is just \\(p\\). But since the temperature always favors one\nor another type, post-selection frequency, \\(p'\\) is never equal to\npre-selection frequency, \\(p\\). Treating a system of warm/cold type\nthat undergoes temporally variable selection as though it undergoes\ndrift would lead to making false inferences about its dynamics. Cases\nof temporally variable selection of the warm/cold sort simply must be\nmodeled using type recursions in which fitness parameters are a\nfunction of time; the pioneering analysis of such systems was done by\nDempster (1955). The above point generalizes: what is quantifiable as\nselection and drift in type recursions is made definite by how fitness\nvariables and effective population size function in those models. \nThe story is different, however, with the Price Equation, owing to how\nrandomness is handled in that formalism. A version of the Price\nEquation in which both selection and drift are represented is this\n(Okasha 2006: 32): \nwhere \nHere, the second term quantifies change due to drift (Okasha 2006:\n33). Note how the \\(\\mu_{i}\\) parameter quantifies deviation from\nexpectation, and hence drift is a function of how the expectation is\ndetermined. Nothing about the Price Equation formalism constrains such\ndeterminations. In the warm/cold population, whether a given\nyear’s evolution is quantified by the first right-hand side\nterm, and hence constitutes change due to selection, or the second\none, and hence constitutes change due to drift, will be determined by\nwhether the theorist treats the weather as contributing to expected\nfitness. If, for instance, she is ignorant of how the weather changes\nyear to year, she may treat the weather as drift; if she can predict\nit, she may not do so. Deployment of the Price Equation is compatible\nwith both treating the weather as contributing to expected fitness and\ntreating it as causing deviation from expectation. \nThe result is that a theorist deploying the Price Equation may treat\nas drift (that is, quantify as deviation from expectation) what a\ntheorist deploying type recursions must treat as selection (quantify\nby fitness variables). It is possible to make assumptions using the\nPrice Equation such that the drift term quantifies what is quantified\nby the drift term in type recursions, but nothing about the Price\nEquation proper forces one to do this, and indeed proponents of the\nPrice Equation, such as Grafen (2000), tout how the drift term in the\nPrice Equation may quantify all sorts of randomness, explicitly\nincluding randomness that is not quantifiable as drift in type\nrecursions. \nAs noted earlier, selection and drift are construed in logically\ndistinct fashions in type recursions and the Price Equation. What is\ncalled is selection in type recursions is one sort of definite thing:\nit’s whatever it is that must be quantified by fitness\nvariables. What is called selection in the Price Equation is another\nthing, and this will be determined by researchers’ understanding\nof the system, in particular how they generate expectations about\nfitness. Ultimately, the conflict between the two modeling approaches\nwith respect to what counts as selection may be resolvable in at least\na couple of ways. Perhaps one modeling approach is simply wrong about\nwhat selection is. Alternatively, something having to do with\nselection is arbitrary here. In particular, whether some or another\nform of randomness should be treated as selection or drift is a\nfunction of one’s choice of which modeling approach to use,\nwhere distinct approaches provide logically distinct understandings of\n“selection” and “drift”. Once one chooses to\nmodel the system using type recursions, one’s hand is forced:\nthe temperature must be modeled as selection. Once one chooses to\nmodel the system using the Price Equation, one’s hand remains\nfree: one may treat the changing temperature as relevant to expected\nfitness, and hence treat it as selection, or instead treat it as\nproducing deviation from expectation, and thereby treat it as drift.\nAccording to this second way of resolving the conflict, the choice\nbetween the two modeling approaches is not dictated by nature, and is\nthus at least metaphysically (if not pragmatically) arbitrary. \nAs noted above, evolutionary theory cannot do its job unless it has an\nexplanatory structure. Philosophers have contended selection explains\na variety of things in a variety of ways. \nThere exists a longstanding debate among both scientists and\nphilosophers over exactly what natural selection can explain, one\nbegun by Sober and Neander who were concerned with what natural\nselection can explain (Sober 1984, 1995; Neander 1988, 1995). In a\nrecent expansive treatment, Razeto-Barry & Frick 2011 distinguish\nbetween the creative and non-creative views of natural selection. On\nthe non-creative view, natural selection merely eliminates traits\nwhile doing nothing to create new ones; the latter phenomenon is the\nresult of mutation. Proponents of the creative view see natural\nselection as a creative force that makes probable combinations of\nmutations that are necessary for the development of at least some\ntraits. While Razeto-Barry and Frick grant that natural selection\ncannot explain the origin of traits that arise by a single mutation,\nthey argue that it can explain the occurrence of sequences of\nphenotypic changes that would otherwise be wildly unlikely to occur\nwithout selection operating to cause the spread of the changes prior\nto the final one in the sequence. Additionally, it is disputed whether\nnatural selection can explain why an arbitrary individual has the\ntraits it has (Walsh 1998; Pust 2004; Birch 2012). On the positive\nview, selection affects the identity of individual organisms, and it\nis part of the identity of an individual to have been produced by the\nparents that produced it, so natural selection explains why\nindividuals have the traits they do. On the negative view, the\nexplanatory scope of natural selection is limited to population level\nproperties. Razeto-Barry and Frick further consider the question of\nwhether natural selection can explain the existence of individuals,\nultimately arguing against it. \nThe capacity for natural selection to explain has come under fire from\nseveral directions. An important challenge to the explanatory power of\nselection was made by Gould and Lewontin who impugn the veracity of\nselectionist accounts of the origin of traits whose correctness is\npinned on nothing more than their plausibility and capacity to explain\n(Gould & Lewontin 1979: 588). Gould and Lewontin offer several\nexamples of traits for which such “just so” stories are\neasy to construct but nonetheless taken to be true on the basis of\nlittle or no evidence beyond the plausibility of the accounts and\ntheir consistency with the theory. Lennox argues that, when not taken\nas even purportedly true, “just so stories” can play a\ngenuine, if modest, role in the evaluation of scientific theories as\nthought experiments used to assess the explanatory potential of the\ntheory (see also Mayr 1983; Lennox 1991; entry on\n adaptationism).\n In the debate over Darwin’s theory, thought experiments of this\nsort were deployed by both Darwin and his critics in ways both\nlegitimate and rhetorically effective (Lennox 1991). \nAnother attack, or set of attacks, on the ability of natural selection\nto explain have to do with the threat that selectionist explanations\nare circular. This sort of problem with a would-be explanation arises\nwhen one must already know what one means to explain in order to\nconstruct one’s (thereby failed) explanation of it. This problem\nsurfaces, in different ways, in the contexts of Lewontin’s\nrequirements, type recursions, and the Price Equation. \nLewontin’s requirements for evolution by natural selection\ncontain an ambiguity. “Fitness” could refer either to\noffspring number or to fitness variables of the sort found in the\ngenotypic selection equation above (the \\(w\\)’s).\nGodfrey-Smith, in noting that some formalisms do not feature fitness\nvariables at all, is using the term in the latter sense (2007: 496),\nwhile Okasha’s treatment of Lewontin’s requirements uses\nfitness in the former sense. Suppose fitness means offspring number\nand suppose further that the requirements play the role of determining\nunder what circumstances evolutionary theory may be deployed. If these\nthings hold, then the circularity problem arises: we must know that\nthe variants in the system have different numbers of offspring in\norder to apply Lewontin’s requirements to deploy the theory that\nwould explain the very same offspring production despite such\nproduction serving to license the theory’s deployment in the\nfirst place. \nConsider type recursions next. Suppose we must know actual\nreproduction rates to assign relative fitnesses values in type\nrecursions. Were this so, an alleged explanation of the extent of\nevolutionary change in the system that makes crucial use of type\nrecursions would be circular. The circularity problem does not come up\nfor practicing biologists deploying type recursions, as those workers\nrely upon fitness estimates that are inferred from statistical facts\nabout a target system during the estimation phase in order to assign\nvalues to variables in type recursions that are then deployed over the\nsystem during the projection phase. What such biologists mean to\nexplain, the behavior during the projection phase, is different from\nwhat they use to construct the explanation, the behavior during the\nestimation phase (Mills & Beatty 1979; Bouchard & Rosenberg\n2004; the estimation/projection phase contrast is due to Glymour\n2006). \nThat the scientists largely agree about the practice of statistical\nestimation shows that they largely share some tacit concepts of\nselection and fitness, ones it would be an advance for philosophers to\ndefine. Philosophers have developed definitions of fitness. Brandon\nwas the first to defend the propensity interpretation of fitness and\nit has earned much discussion since (Brandon 1978; Mills & Beatty\n1979; Rosenberg 1982; Brandon & Beatty 1984; Brandon 1990; Sober\n2000). Rosenberg and Bouchard have developed a recent definition of\nfitness based on the relationships between an individual and its\nenvironment that contribute to the individual’s success\n(Bouchard & Rosenberg 2004; for more on “fitness” see\nentry on\n fitness). \nTurning finally to how the tautology problem surfaces in the context\nof the Price Equation, consider how that equation formally represents\nthe extent of evolution across some time period in which reproduction\noccurs. Assigning values to its statistical functions requires\ninformation that spans that time period, such as information about the\noffspring number of the parents and the phenotypes of the offspring.\nThe deployment of the Price Equation does not involve any\nestimation/projection period contrast. It cannot be used a source of\nnew information about some time period that remains otherwise\nunexamined. The Price Equation could not, for instance, be used to\nmake a prediction about the dynamics of some system into the future in\nthe same way that type recursions can do. This is because “an\napplication of the Price equation for the purpose of prediction would\npresuppose the very information you want to predict with it”\n(Otsuka 2016: 466). For this reason, Otsuka claims that the equation\nis not explanatory (2016: 466). \nAnother difficulty faced by selectionist explanations has to do with\ntheir reliability. Glymour has argued against the reliability of\nexplanations constructed using type recursions: “population\ngenetics models evolving populations with the wrong variables related\nby the wrong equations employing the wrong kinds of parameters”\n(Glymour 2006: 371). Glymour demonstrates that exogenous fitness\nvariables cannot be used to quantify environmental causes of\nreproduction that change in their influence during the projection\nperiod. Fitness cannot be a kind of summary variable that abstracts\naway from the causal details of the natural population while also\nfunctioning to reliably predict and explain the dynamics of the\nsystems to which type recursions apply. Gildenhuys (Gildenhuys 2011)\nprovides a response to Glymour, acceding that his arguments are valid\nbut contending that there are a variety of ways to complexify type\nrecursions to formally handle the influence of environmental causes;\nGlymour (2013) provides a reply. \nPhilosophers interested in explanation have recently turned their\nattention to mechanisms: “mechanisms are sought to explain how a\nphenomenon comes about or how some significant process works”\n(Machamer, Darden, & Craver 2000: 2). One way to secure\nexplanatory status for selection would be to show that it functions as\na mechanism. Whether natural selection qualifies as a mechanism is\ncontroversial. Skipper and Millstein gainsay the position: natural\nselection not organized in the right sort of way to count as a\nmechanism, exhibits a lack of productive continuity between stages,\nand further lacks the requisite sort regularity of operation (Skipper\n& Millstein 2005: 335). Barros (2008) has argued that natural\nselection may be characterized as a two-level mechanism, with a\npopulation-level mechanism and an individual-level mechanism working\ntogether. Havstad (2011) responds that the account Barros offers is\ntoo general and so includes any selective process, not just natural\nselection. Moreover, the parts/entities and activities/interactions\nthat supposedly make-up the mechanism of selection can only be\nspecified by the roles in the selective process, whereas mechanistic\nexplanation works by associating these roles with specific phenomena\n(Havstad 2011: 522–523). Matthews (2016) offers a case study of\nthe debate over selection as a mechanism, while DesAutels (2016)\nprovides a defense of a mechanistic view. \nGodfrey-Smith makes the point that some character could fit\nLewontin’s conditions for evolution by natural selection by mere\nchance. Parents with a particular trait could have more offspring than\nparents without it, even though the trait does not causally influence\noffspring number (Godfrey-Smith 2007: 511). In such cases, Lewontin\nwould rule there is evolution by natural selection, provided that the\ntrait is heritable, since individuals with it have a de facto\nhigher rate of survival and reproduction, if only by chance. Equally,\na trait could spread by hitchhiking and meet Lewontin’s\nrequirements for selection (or Okasha’s for that matter). A\nhitchhiking trait is correlated with one that causes reproduction, and\nas a result, individuals with the trait exhibit increased\nreproduction, despite the trait not causing reproduction at all. But,\nfor Godfrey-Smith, there is no natural selection, at least in the\nfocused sense, on the trait in these sorts of cases because\ndifferences in the character had no causal role in producing variation\nin offspring number (Godfrey-Smith 2007: 513). \nAs noted earlier, theorists working on type recursions who defend the\nview that selection is a distinct quantity from drift typically defend\nthe view that it is also a distinct cause. Forber and Reisman\nexplicitly invoke the interventionist account of causation and argue\nthat natural selection (and drift) qualify as causes (Reisman &\nForber 2005). They do so on the basis of an examination of\nexperimental work in which selection (and drift) are manipulated to\nproduce changes in population-level behavior. “Causalists”\nworking with type recursions must confront the natural philosophical\nchallenge of stating, precisely, what cause or causes count as\nselection, that is, what exactly fitness coefficients quantify. The\nBeatty/Millstein interpretation of selection as discriminate sampling\nis explicitly causal. Equally, Otsuka’s position that fitness\ncoefficients should be interpreted as linear path coefficients from\nphenotype to offspring number in causal graphs is clearly causal as\nwell. \nThe Price Equation may be deployed for some system without regard to\nwhat causal relationships hold within it. Okasha argues that variants\nof the equation may constitute causally adequate representations under\nspecial circumstances. It is important to distinguish this contention\nfrom the contention that the Price Equation is causally interpretable.\nThe right-hand side terms of the Price Equation are (algebraic\nfunctions of) statistical functions, while, in causally interpretable\nequations, causes are variables (Woodward 2003: 93). A causally\ninterpretable system of equations is one that one features causal\nvariables on its right-hand side and effects on the left: \\(a = b\\) is\ncausally interpretable if \\(b\\) causes \\(a\\) but not if the\nreverse. Okasha does not call any formulation of the Price Equation\ncausally interpretable. However, the notion of causal adequacy he does\ndeploy seems to have been developed solely in the context\nOkasha’s discussion of the Price Equation and thus risks being\nabout causation in name only. \nOkasha’s basic approach is to assess whether some formulation of\nthe Price Equation as a causally adequate representation in terms of\nwhether the statistical functions in the equation take positive values\nwhile their arguments are causally related (2016: 447). In a\nmulti-level, causally adequate version of the Price Equation, \nwhere \nOkasha proposes a test for causal adequacy that works this way: if the\nfirst term takes a positive value, then \\(W_{k}\\) and \\(P_{k}\\) must\nbe causally related, or else the equation is not causally adequate.\nEqually, a version of the Price Equation is not causally adequate if\nits statistical functions take a positive value despite their\ncomponents failing to be causally related, or if its statistical\nfunctions take value zero when their components are causally related.\nWhether a version of the Price Equation is causally adequate is thus a\nfunction of the causal relationships among the variables in the\nsystem. On this approach, the concept of causal adequacy means\nsomething different than causal interpretability does for equations\nthat exhibit dependencies between variables that represent causes. \nThis entry initially distinguished two usages of “natural\nselection”, the focused and the capacious one, the focused one\npicking out a single formal element of the process captured by the\ncapacious sense. There are some intermediate cases. Brandon offers\nthis definition of selection: selection is differential reproduction\nthat is due to differential adaptedness to a common selective\nenvironment (Brandon 2005: 160). This definition does not attempt to\ncapture the entirety of Darwin’s process: while it identifies\nnatural selection with a type of reproduction, there is no mention of\ninheritance or replication. Repeat a process specified to fit\nBrandon’s definition as often as you like and we still might not\nhave something that makes adaptation or speciation explicable. But\nneither is Brandon’s definition of selection appropriate as an\ninterpretation of a theoretical term in any formalism. Instead, that\ndefinition connects with an effort to develop a Principle of\nNatural Selection which would serve a seminal role in a\nqualitative version of Darwin’s theory. The Principle is\nformulated using probability talk along with the notion of fitness.\nThe historical development of the Principle of Natural Selection,\nbeginning with Brandon together with Beatty and Mills (Brandon 1978;\nMills & Beatty 1979), has been guided by debates over the\ninterpretation of probability and fitness addressed elsewhere (Brandon\n1990: ch. 1; Sober 2000; Campbell & Robert 2005; entry on\n fitness). \n“Natural selection” has been used to pick out one, or\nmultiple, or all the elements of a single cycle of the recursive\nprocess that we learned from Darwin. Seemingly, there is arbitrariness\nin how one decides to deploy the term natural selection, such that any\npart of Darwin’s recursive process could be treated as the\nnatural selection part. It is difficult to say that either\nBrandon, or Okasha, or Otsuka, or Millstein is wrong in their\ncharacterizations of selection, even though the characterizations are\nsuperficially logically incompatible. The several definitions pick out\ngenuine elements of genuine processes, each with their own significant\ntheoretical importance.","contact.mail":"gildenhp@lafayette.edu","contact.domain":"lafayette.edu"}]
