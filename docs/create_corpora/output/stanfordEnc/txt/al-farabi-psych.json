He\nwrote extensively on logic, philosophy of language, metaphysics,\nnatural philosophy, ethics, political philosophy, philosophical\npsychology and epistemology. His teachings had a strong Aristotelian\nbackground and at the same time a significant Neoplatonic bent. One of\nthe greatest Islamic thinkers, Avicenna (d. 1037), explicitly admits\nin his autobiography his intellectual debt to al-Fārābī\nthrough whom he was able to understand the Metaphysics of\nAristotle. Overall, al-Fārābī became an important\nreference within the Islamic intellectual milieu as a source of both\ninfluence and contention.\n\n\nThe precise chronology of al-Fārābī’s works is\ndifficult to establish. He wrote treatises devoted to the explanation\nof Plato and Aristotle, commentaries and paraphrases of\nAristotle’s works, and other treatises where he develops his own\nphilosophical thought unifying his metaphysical and cosmological views\nwith his psychology, and even with his political philosophy. His views\nconcerning psychological and epistemological matters appear in several\nplaces within his treatises. Hence, it is necessary to consider\nseveral works where he clarifies and completes his thoughts on the\nmatter. The Principles of Existing Things, also known as\nThe Political Regime (Kitāb al-siyāsa\nal-madaniyya), and The Principles and Opinions of the People\nof the Virtuous City (Mabādi’ ārā’\nahl al-madīnah al-fāḍilah), are some of\nal-Fārābī’s major works where he deals with\npsychological topics such as the nature of the soul, its cognitive\ncapacities, and the doctrine of the intellect. Furthermore, there is\nanother important treatise where al-Fārābī directly\ndeals with the intellective faculty, namely, The Treatise on the\nIntellect (Risālah fi’l-‘aql). This\nwork shows signs of the influence of Aristotle’s doctrine of the\nsoul and its interpretation by Alexander of Aphrodisias. In fact, M.\nGeoffroy (2002: 191–231) contends that al-Fārābī\nprobably never read a complete translation of Aristotle’s On\nthe Soul but knew it through Alexander’s treatises, mainly\nthe On the Intellect. Al-Fārābī addresses\nepistemological topics such as the understanding of scientific\nknowledge and the nature of demonstration and certitude mainly in the\nBook of Demonstration (Kitāb al-burhān)\nand the Book on the Conditions of Certitude (Kitāb\nŠara’iṭ al-yaqīn). In order to cover the\ndiversity of psychological and epistemological matters in\nal-Fārābī’s works, this article is divided as\nfollows:\n\n\nIn one of his best-known introductory works, Enumeration of the\nSciences (Iḥṣā’ al-Ulūm),\nal-Fārābī (ES: 87) explains that the eighth part of the\nscience of physics is devoted to what is common to the different kinds\nof animals, namely, the soul, and is studied in Aristotle’s\nBook of Animals and in On the Soul.\nAl-Fārābī describes the soul as Aristotle did in On\nthe Soul 2.1, 412a19, that is, as the form or actualization\n(ἐντελέχεια /\nantalāshiyā or at-tamām) of a natural\norganic body that potentially has\n life.[1]\n Living beings have different faculties: the nutritive, sensitive,\nappetitive, and rational faculties. The presence of these capacities\nin living beings is due to the different kinds of soul. The origin of\nthese souls and their capacities is explained by\nal-Fārābī from a metaphysical, cosmological, and\nbiological perspective. \nIn fact, al-Fārābī’s entire philosophy, including\nhis psychological and epistemological views, must be understood in\nlight of his ontological and cosmological worldview, a matter that has\nbeen a source of considerable debate. In The Political Regime\nand The Virtuous City, al-Fārābī provides a\nmetaphysical and ontological explanation of the structure of the\nuniverse, combining Neoplatonic emanationism and Aristotelian views on\nthe celestial spheres (M. Mahdi 2001: 6–11; 121–124).\nOthers have argued that al-Fārābī’s account\nconcerning these matters in both treatises should not be taken\nliterally, but as a political metaphor of the kind of regimes that can\nbe conceived in political philosophy. In contrast, P. Vallat and D.\nJanos have rejected this view and have shown that far from a mere\nrhetorical strategy, al-Fārābī’s cosmology\nconstitutes the foundation of his political thought. Though these\ndifferent approaches have motivated controversial interpretations of\nal-Fārābī’s philosophy, this article concurs with\nthe interpretation of Vallat (2004: 85–128) and Janos (2012:\n38–43). To take al-Fārābī’s cosmology as a\ntrue component of his philosophy has serious implications for the\nunderstanding of his philosophical psychology:\nal-Fārābī’s conception of the soul and intellect\ncannot be understood without taking into account his cosmological\nmodel. In this way it becomes clear that his psychology and cosmology\ntaken together motivate his political philosophy.  \nAs D. Janos (2010: 19–44) has shown in depth,\nal-Fārābī’s cosmology draws on the Proclus\nArabus (mainly the Maḥd al-khayr [Elements of\nTheology]), late ancient commentators such as Alexander,\nSimplicius, Themistius, and in general from the Neoplatonica\nArabica, including the Plotinus Arabus (Janos 2012:\n4–6; 11–37; D’Ancona 2014). Both The Political\nRegime and The Virtuous City are key sources for the\nreconstruction of al-Fārābī’s cosmology which\nconsists in a hierarchical emanationist model constituted by six\nprinciples: (1) the First Existent or First Cause, (2) the second\nintellects, (3) the active (or agent) intellect, (4) the soul, (5)\nform, and (6) matter (al-Fārābī KS: 31; PR: 29). The\nFirst Cause is one and unique, precluding any multiplicity, whereas\nall other principles are multiple. The first three principles are not\nbodies, nor are in a body; they are immaterial and separate, whereas\nthe three last principles are not bodies but are connected to the\nbodies. Notice that the soul is one of the principles that will be\noriginated through the emanative process and is described as a\nprinciple that is not a body in itself but is in a body.\nAl-Fārābī explains that the universe contains six kinds\nof body. In decreasing order of perfection, there are: (1) celestial\nbodies, (2) rational animals, (3) non-rational animals, (4) plants,\n(5) minerals, and (6) the four elements (al-Fārābī KS:\n31; PR: 29). \nAccording to the emanation (fayḍ) process described by\nal-Fārābī, the existence of every being proceeds from\nthe First Existent (mawjūd al-awwal), which is perfect,\neternal, everlasting, uncaused, free of matter and without form, with\nno purpose or aim external to itself, with no partner or opposite, and\nindivisible (al-Fārābī VC: 56–89). The First\nExistent is distinguished from all other beings due to its oneness,\nwhich is its essence. This description seems very close to the\nNeoplatonic conception of the One, but it is not exactly the same.\nAl-Fārābī instead argues that, given that this First\nExistent is not in matter and has no matter, it should be an actual\nintellect (‘aql bi’l fi‘l). The First\nExistent is also intelligible (ma‘qūl) through its\nsubstance, and its identity consists in simultaneously being the act,\nthe subject, and the object of its own intellection\n(al-Fārābī VC: 70–71). This description is based\non Aristotle’s characterization of the unmoved mover in\nMetaphysics Lambda as thought thinking itself. \nEvery existent comes to be, according to al-Fārābī, by\nthe First Existent. This takes place through a sort of expansion or\nemanation through which the First Existent necessarily gives existence\nto every being in the universe. Yet this does not imply any addition\nto its own perfection. In the initial emanation, from the First\nExistent proceed the second intellects. These intellects themselves,\nthrough the apprehension of themselves and the First Existent, are in\nturn the cause of the celestial bodies. In The Political\nRegime al-Fārābī mentions that the number of\nsecond intellects or second causes is identical to the number of\ncelestial spheres from the highest, the first heaven, to the last,\nnamely, the sphere of the moon (al-Fārābī KS: 32; PR:\n29). In The Virtuous City he explicitly enumerates nine\nspheres starting with the first heaven, and then the fixed stars,\nSaturn, Jupiter, Mars, the sun, Venus, Mercury, and the moon\n(al-Fārābī VC: 100–105). There is a tenth\nintellect, namely, the active intellect (‘aql al-fa\n‘‘āl), whose activity is very relevant mainly\nfor two reasons: (1) this intellect governs together with the\ncelestial spheres the sublunary world, and is even involved in the\nprocesses of generation and corruption (al-Fārābī LI:\n29–30; OI:\n 75);[2]\n (2) furthermore, as will be explained in the fourth section, this\nintellect also provides the first principles of understanding through\nwhich human beings can attain happiness (al-Fārābī VC:\n204–205). \nThus far we have explained the first three principles in\nal-Fārābī’s emanationist model (the First Cause,\nthe second intellects, and the active intellect). The other three\nprinciples (the soul, the matter and the form) have in common their\nconnection to the different bodies that comprise the universe. In\nThe Political Regime al-Fārābī explains these\nprinciples following a particular order: first the soul, then the\nmatter, and finally the form; in The Virtuous City, however,\nhe first explains what matter and form are and subsequently gives a\nprecise account of the soul and its faculties\n(al-Fārābī VC: 134–163). This latter approach is\nclearer for two main reasons: (1) the long explanation that\nal-Fārābī provides concerning the origin of matter from\nthe most imperfect, that is, prime matter, to the most excellent,\nnamely, rational animals, sets forth a precise framework for the\nunderstanding of the rational human soul; (2) the explanation\nconcerning the relation between matter and form gives us a better\nunderstanding of the relation between body and soul. Matter is the\nsubstratum of the form and, hence, the form does not have subsistence\nby itself since it needs matter; however, matter only exists due to\nthe form (al-Fārābī VC: 108–109). \nConcerning the origin and composition of matter,\nal-Fārābī explains that the circular motion of the\ncelestial spheres generates prime matter (al-madda\nal-ūlā), which is common to all bodies in the sublunary\nworld. The four elements proceed from prime matter and, when these\nelements combine and mix in different ways and undergo the influence\nof the heavenly bodies, they generate numerous kinds of bodies:\nminerals, plants, non-rational animals, and rational animals\n(al-Fārābī VC:\n 112–115).[3]\n Given that matter is the substratum of form, the different forms\nappear when the combination of the elements takes place, giving rise\nto different kinds of bodies. As there are different kinds of bodies,\nthere are also different kinds of forms, some of them of lower\nperfection, as the form of minerals or plants, and others more\nperfect, as the form of rational animals. This perfection is given by\nthe faculties that each body has according to its natural disposition:\nwhile plants have basic faculties such as nutrition or reproduction,\nrational animals have a higher faculty, the intellect, which enables\nhuman beings to attain intelligibles in act. \nIn The Political Regime al-Fārābī deals with\nthe relation between matter and form, and explains that form is the\nactualization of matter in the sense that form is more excellent than\nmatter; however, matter is the substratum of form and without matter\nthere is no form (al-Fārābī KS: 39; PR: 36). As can be\nseen, al-Fārābī is a partisan of Aristotelian\nhylomorphism. This relates to his understanding of the soul as the\nform or actualization of the body and thus perishable with the body.\nFor al-Fārābī, as for Aristotle, the soul is\nresponsible for the capacities or operations of the human body. When\nreferring to the human soul, al-Fārābī holds that the\nrational part can come to realize itself to such a degree of\nperfection that it no longer has need of the body, and can come very\nclose to reaching the status of a separate being\n(al-Fārābī KS: 42; PR: 38). In other words, the\nrational part is able to separate itself from its other\nfaculties—sensitive, appetitive, and imaginative—in order\nto attain perfection by transforming itself into an eternal\nimperishable intellect. As can be seen, al-Fārābī\nrenders an account on the origin of the soul and its faculties by\nmeans of a rather complex ontological and cosmological process,\nthrough which the human soul progressively attains greater perfection.\nNevertheless, before explaining what this perfection consists in, I\nshall discuss al-Fārābī’s understanding of the\nfaculties of the soul and their function.  \nIn The Virtuous City al-Fārābī devotes an\nentire chapter to the faculties of the human soul, from the most basic\nand lowest, namely nutrition, to the most perfect and highest, that\nis, the rational or intellective faculty (al-Fārābī VC:\n164–175). Nutrition is shared among plants, animals and human\nbeings; next there is a group of faculties, the external senses\n(touch, taste, smell, hearing, and sight). Animals and human being\nshare these senses. Along with these sensitive faculties there is also\nthe appetitive faculty through which humans and animals experience\ndesire or aversion towards the objects they perceive through the\nsenses. Then, proceeding with the internal senses, there is the\nimaginative faculty whose function is to retain the sensible\nimpressions when these are no longer present to the external senses.\nThis faculty also has the capacity to combine sensibles with each\nother, to connect and disconnect them in different compositions and\ndivisions, some of them being false, and some true\n(al-Fārābī VC: 168–169). The imaginative faculty\nis also linked to the appetitive faculty given that it is possible to\ndesire imaginative representations. The role of this faculty in human\ncognition is particularly relevant and is given separate attention in\nthe next section. Last and highest in al-Fārābī’s\naccount is the rational or intellective faculty\n(‘aql). \nAl-Fārābī gives a complete explanation of the way in\nwhich all the faculties of the soul work together. Each faculty has a\nruling organ and others that are auxiliaries and subordinates\n(al-Fārābī VC: 174–187). He holds that the ruling\norgan in the human body is the heart; the brain is a secondary ruling\norgan subordinated to the heart; however, all the other organs and\nlimbs are subordinated to the brain. The heart rules every faculty\nthrough subordinate organs and limbs. Thus, the ruling organ of\nnutrition is the heart and the subordinates are the other organs that\nintervene in the process of nutrition, that is, the stomach, the\nliver, the spleen, etc. The faculty of sensation is explained\nfollowing the same model: the heart rules sensation, and its\nsubordinates or auxiliaries are the five senses whose function is to\napprehend sensibles. The imaginative faculty is located in the heart\nand has no auxiliaries distributed in other organs, but it controls\nwhat is provided by the five senses. According to\nal-Fārābī, the imaginative faculty is able to separate\nand connect what is provided by the five senses in different ways,\nsometimes attaining an image in agreement with what has been\nperceived, sometimes something different (al-Fārābī VC:\n168–169). Concerning the rational faculty,\nal-Fārābī explains that it is also located in the heart\nand has neither auxiliaries nor subordinates, but rules the other\nfaculties, namely, the imaginative, the sensitive, and the nutritive\n(al-Fārābī VC: 169–171). \nThe appetitive faculty makes the will (irāda) arise once\nthe sensitive, the imaginative, or the rational faculties have\napprehended something. Appetite, according to\nal-Fārābī, may be towards knowing or doing a thing,\neither with the whole body or with some limb or organ. The auxiliaries\nand subordinates of this faculty are, therefore, all the organs\ninvolved in the motion of the body. In other words, the limbs, nerves,\nand muscles spread throughout the body serve as instruments and\nsubordinates of the appetitive faculty (al-Fārābī VC:\n170–171). \nNotice that al-Fārābī is following Aristotle according\nto whom the heart is the center of the biological and even perceptive\ncapacities of animals and human beings. The heart is relevant because\nit is the source of innate heat or the vital innate spirit, which\nspreads through the blood vessels sustaining and preserving all the\nparts of the body. The second major organ, the brain, regulates the\nheat disseminated by the heart (al-Fārābī VC:\n176–177). This innate heat is the principle of life. This\nbiological account helps explain the origin and nature of the soul. In\nthe previous section I explained al-Fārābī’s\nunderstanding of the origin and composition of matter and its relation\nto the form. When referring specifically to the conformity of the\nhuman body and the origin of the rational soul,\nal-Fārābī holds that the conformity of this kind of\nbody with its corresponding set of faculties is only possible when the\nheat of the heart reaches a certain temperature. \nFollowing Aristotle, al-Fārābī explains the role of the\nreproductive faculty (al-Fārābī VC: 186–197) in\nthe origin of the body and the soul. He holds that the female prepares\nthe matter while the male prepares the form. Once again, he insists on\nthe centrality of the heart, which provides the matter of the living\nbeing through the womb and the form through the organ that generates\nthe semen. The semen, once entering the womb, finds inside of it the\nblood that had been previously prepared by the womb in order to\nreceive the human form contained in the semen. The semen in turn\nendows this blood with a capacity that enables the blood to move and\nstart forming the different organs that make up the human body. Hence,\nthe blood from the womb serves as the matter that receives the human\nform contained in the semen, which is to say that the semen serves as\nthe rennet by which the milk is curdled. Just as the rennet is that by\nvirtue of which fresh milk curdles, while not being part of the\ncurdled milk nor of its matter, so it happens with the semen, which is\nnot part of the clogged blood or of its matter. Hence, the embryo is\nconstituted in the same way that fresh milk is curdled by the action\nof the curdling principle, that is, the rennet. \nWhen the blood in the womb receives the form from the semen, the first\nthing that arises is precisely the heart (al-Fārābī VC:\n186–187). The other organs in the body emerge only once the rest\nof the faculties, beginning with the nutritive faculty, are present in\nthe heart. The developing organs include those that are endowed with\nspecifically female or male procreative faculties. Therefore, male and\nfemale individuals share all organs but those with reproductive\nfunctions and, similarly, both share all the faculties of the soul,\nthat is, the sensitive, the imaginative, and the rational faculties\n(al-Fārābī VC: 196–197). \nAll of this detailed biological discussion helps explain the emergence\nof the perceptive faculties in animals and human beings. Both have\nsensation so that they can receive the impressions produced by\nexternal objects and, through the imaginative faculty, they can retain\nsensibles while no longer being in contact with the exterior world.\nAnimals are able to react to the external world because they possess\nsensation and imagination, so they can experience pleasure and pain,\nor detect those situations that are damaging or dangerous for them. In\nthe case of human beings, in addition to the imaginative faculty, the\nrational faculty is essential for cognition: human cognition is\ncharacterized not by the mere attainment of sensible forms but,\nrather, by the attainment of intelligibles. Furthermore, it is the\nfaculty through which human beings attain the sciences and the arts,\nand through which they are able to discern between good habits and\ngood deeds from those that are bad. By this faculty humans are able to\nreflect on whether something should be done and they can recognize\nwhat is useful, pleasant, and harmful (al-Fārābī VC:\n165). \nThe rational faculty is both theoretical and practical\n(al-Fārābī KS: 32–33; PR: 29–31). In its\ntheoretical aspect, the rational faculty allows humans to attain the\nknowledge of things that are in a certain way and cannot be otherwise;\nthat is, humans are not able to act upon them or alter them. For\nexample, we cannot do anything to alter the fact that three is an odd\nnumber and four an even number (al-Fārābī SA: §7,\n15–16). In contrast, in its practical aspect, the rational\nfaculty deals with those things humans can act upon and alter. In this\npractical dimension, the rational faculty involves skills and\ncalculation. Skills refer to acquired abilities for practicing\nactivities such as carpentry, farming, medicine, or sailing, while\ncalculation is related to those situations where we need to deliberate\nabout something we want to do, when we want to do it, whether it is\npossible to do it and, if possible, how it should be done\n(al-Fārābī VC: 208–209; SA: §7,\n15–16). \nAs can be seen, the rational faculty is responsible for human\ncognition in all its aspects. However, though al-Fārābī\ngives much importance to this faculty, he also devotes much attention\nto the imaginative faculty in itself and its interactions with the\nrational faculty. The two following sections review in more detail the\nrole of the imaginative and the rational or intellective faculties in\nhuman cognition, respectively. \nAccording to al-Fārābī the imaginative faculty is very\nactive in human cognitive acts. As outlined above, its function is to\nretain sense impressions when they are no longer perceived as external\nstimuli, and also to combine, compose, and even reproduce, those\nimpressions. Following the Aristotelian account,\nal-Fārābī thinks that the imaginative faculty is\nintermediate between the sensitive and rational faculties. In fact, in\nthe case of human beings, its function is to provide reason with the\nimpressions attained through the senses, but it also serves the\nrational faculty in other ways, as will be shown. \nIn the waking state the imaginative faculty is permanently engaged\nwith the rational, appetitive, and sensible faculties. In such a state\nthe sensible faculty is actively working in interaction with sensibles\nand sense impressions. Likewise, as mentioned, the imaginative faculty\nprovides both the rational and appetitive faculties with these sense\nimpressions. Nevertheless, when in the sleeping state, the sensitive,\nappetitive, and rational faculties cease their activities, and this is\nwhen the imaginative faculty performs a distinctive action of its own.\nGiven that the sensitive faculty is at ease and no longer receiving\nfresh sense impressions, the imaginative faculty turns now to the\nimpressions preserved in itself, and acts upon them by means of\ncomposition and division. Hence, the imaginative faculty has the power\nto preserve and manipulate sense impressions through composition or\ndivision, both in the case of those freshly offered by the senses\nwhile in the waking state and those that have been stored in it\n(al-Fārābī VC: 210–227). \nIn addition to the powers described above, the imaginative faculty has\na distinctive capacity, that is, “reproductive imitation”\nor mimesis (muhākāt). Reproductive imitation refers\nto the capacity displayed by the imaginative faculty to imitate a\nseries of elements by means of the sensibles stored in it. Through\nthese sensibles, the imaginative faculty can imitate impressions that\npertain to the sensitive faculty, intelligibles that pertain to the\nrational faculty, desires that pertain to the appetitive faculty, and\nalso aspects proper to the nutritive faculty and even the temperament\nof the body (al-Fārābī VC: 210–213). This is why\nthe imagination has the capacity to stimulate particular emotions,\nhumors, desires, and temperaments that move the body and put it into\naction (al-Fārābī VC: 216–219). \nRegarding the relation between the imaginative and rational faculties,\nsince the imaginative faculty only deals with sensibles, in order to\nrelate to the intelligibles it must imitate them by means of\nsensibles. For this reason, when providing his theory of prophecy and\ndivination, al-Fārābī argues that while the active\nintellect usually enables the actualization of the potential\nintelligibles in the material intellect, in some special cases the\nactive intellect directly provides intelligibles that are accessible\nto the imaginative faculty in the form of particular sensibles. These\nevents can take place both in the waking and sleeping states, but are\nrather rare while waking and restricted to a few people\n(al-Fārābī VC: 220–223). \nWhen an individual has a very powerful imaginative faculty, to such a\ndegree that it is no longer restricted to the supply of images to the\nother faculties, it is thus free to experience sensibles of extreme\nbeauty and perfection by means of imitation. The highest rank of\nperfection that the imaginative faculty can achieve is precisely when\nan individual attains prophecy or awareness of present or future\nevents, as well as the capacity to see glorious or divine beings. This\ncan be achieved by means of present and future particulars and the\ntranscendent intelligibles of divine beings, both granted by the\nactive intellect. However, al-Fārābī also expounds a\nseries of inferior ranks below this most perfect attainment of vision,\neach progressively more imperfect than the precedent in terms of\nwhether the vision takes place during waking or sleeping states, and\nwhether the individual has access to particulars or intelligibles.\nAccording to al-Fārābī, the most common kind of vision\nis that of individuals who receive particulars while in the sleeping\nstate. \nAlthough al-Fārābī’s conception of the\nimaginative faculty departs from Aristotle’s view, it combines\nsome elements coming from the Hellenistic and the Middle Platonist\ntraditions that, as Walzer (1957: 142–148) points out, may have\nbeen taken from Porphyry and Proclus. The result is a psychological\nexplanation of prophecy and divination. In recent years, scholars\nworking on the Arabic version of Aristotle’s treatise On\nDivination in Sleep (Hansberger 2008: 73–74; 2010: 158)\nhave suggested that this work is a relevant source for the\nunderstanding of the Islamic philosophical conception of prophecy,\nincluding that of al-Fārābī. The Arabic On\nDivination in Sleep is an adulterated version of\nAristotle’s text and provides a different explanation of\nveridical dreams within a Neoplatonic metaphysical framework, where a\nuniversal intellect distributes veridical dreams and some people with\noutstanding psychological capacities are able to receive them and\ninterpret\n them.[4]\n Even though no explicit references are made to On Divination in\nSleep in al-Fārābī’s The Virtuous\nCity, there are noticeable similarities between the two\ntreatises. \nIt has been mentioned that it is through the intellect that human\nbeings know intelligibles, attain the sciences and the arts, and\ndiscern and reflect on practical matters. In The Treatise on the\nIntellect, known in Latin as De intellectu,\nal-Fārābī provides a complete account of the different\nsenses of the term ‘aql (νοῦς,\nintellect or reason) starting with (1) the use that most people have\ngiven to the term, then (2) the way in which Islamic theologians have\nused it and, (3) finally, the different senses it has in\nAristotle’s works, concretely, in Posterior Analytics,\nNicomachean Ethics, On the Soul, and\nMetaphysics (al-Fārābī LI: 3–4; OI: 68).\n \nMost people use the term ‘aql to describe the capacity\nthat enables a person to discern which deeds are virtuous and which\nare not by means of deliberation. This first sense is very close to\nAristotle’s conception of prudence. Similarly, Islamic\ntheologians use this term to refer to those actions that are accepted\nor repudiated in general or by the majority. More important for our\npurposes in this article are the different senses of the term in the\nAristotelian corpus. According to al-Fārābī, in\nPosterior Analytics 2.19, ‘aql is understood\nas a faculty of the soul by means of which certainty about necessary,\ntrue, and universal premises is attained. Premises of this kind are\nnot arrived at by means of syllogisms, but are present in the subject\nin a prior way, either by nature or without one being aware of how\nthese premises were acquired. Hence, this faculty is some part of the\nsoul by which humans have access to the first principles of the\ntheoretical sciences. I shall refer to this use of the term in detail\nin the final section of this article (al-Fārābī LI:\n5–9; OI: 69–70). \nIn Nicomachean Ethics 6.6, Aristotle uses the term\nνοῦς to refer to a part of the soul, namely\nprudence (φρονησις /\nta‘aqqul), the ability to apprehend through experience\nthe principles of practical matters. Certainly, just as Aristotle\nrefers to the first principles of the theoretical sciences, he\nholds—and al-Fārābī after him—that there\nare also first principles of the practical\n sciences.[5]\n Another sense is found in On the Soul 3.4 where, according\nto al-Fārābī, Aristotle divides the intellect into (1)\npotential (also known as material or passive) (‘aql\nbi-l-quwah), (2) actual or intellect in actuality (‘aql\nbi’l-fi‘l), (3) acquired intellect (‘aql\nal-mustafāḍ), and (4) active or agent intellect\n(‘aql al-fa ‘‘āl)\n(al-Fārābī LI: 9–11; LC: 215; OI: 70–71).\nNotice that these stages are not present in Aristotle’s On\nthe Soul, but in Alexander’s On the Intellect.\nThis is one of the aspects that show evidence that\nal-Fārābī draws extensively upon Alexander, as several\nscholars have noticed (Davidson 1992: 48–63 & 65–70;\nGeoffroy 2002: 191–231; Vallat 2004: 33–42). Finally, in\nMetaphysics Lambda, according to\nal-Fārābī’s account, Aristotle refers to the\nFirst Principle of existing things as the First Intellect\n(al-Fārābī LI: 35–36; OI: 78).  \nGiven the purpose of this article, the account of the intellect as\nused in the psychological context of the On the Soul deserves\ndeeper consideration (al-Fārābī LI: 12–35; LC:\n215–221; OI: 71–78). This approach is exhaustively\nexamined both in The Treatise on the Intellect and in The\nVirtuous City. In the latter there is a complete account of the\nway in which the rational or intellectual faculty acts\n(al-Fārābī VC: 196–211). Once\nal-Fārābī has explained the role of the imaginative\nfaculty as that which provides the intellect with impressions attained\nthrough the senses, he next explains the process whereby they become\nintelligibles in act. Following Aristotle and the Aristotelian\ntradition, al-Fārābī describes the intellect as being\nitself potential or, using Alexander’s terminology, an innate\n“natural disposition”\n(ἐπιτηδειότης\n/ isti‘dād) (al-Fārābī VC:\n198–199; Geoffroy 2002: 204). This kind of intellect is\nfrequently called “potential”, “material”, or\n“passive”, and is simply the rational faculty with which\nall human beings are endowed. \nIn The Treatise on the Intellect al-Fārābī\nrefers to the material intellect (νοῦς\nὑλικὸς, a Greek term coined by\nAlexander) as a soul or part of the soul, or one of the faculties of\nthe soul, or something that is in potency to abstract the forms from\ntheir matter and turning these into forms for itself\n(al-Fārābī LI: 12–16; LC: 215; OI:\n 71–72).[6]\n When these forms are abstracted, they become intelligibles or forms\nfor the material intellect. It can be rightly said that for\nal-Fārābī the material intellect is like the matter\nwhere the abstracted forms come to be, where the material intellect\nitself becomes the abstracted forms, just as the imprinted object\nleaves its mark on a piece of wax. \nBefore a form of the objects outside the soul has been abstracted, the\nmaterial intellect is just in potency to receive those forms or\npotential intelligibles; but when these latter come to be in the\nmaterial intellect, the material intellect becomes an actual\nintellect, and the potential intelligibles are actualized. Now, the\nexistence of actual intelligibles is different from their existence as\npotential intelligibles or forms in matter. When external to the soul\nand linked to matter, forms are affected by place, time, position,\nquantity, and the like. But when forms are actualized in the soul,\nmany of these qualities are removed and their existence thus becomes\ndifferent from their former existence as forms of bodies outside the\nsoul (al-Fārābī LI: 16–17; LC: 216; OI: 72). \nSince the actual intellect becomes itself the actual intelligibles,\nthen they are one and the same thing: what is understood is not\ndifferent from the intellect itself, since the actual intelligible has\nbecome the form of the actual intellect. If other intelligibles come\nto be in the actual intellect, they will also be actualized. As a\nconsequence, the actual intellect will be able to understand on its\nown and not by means of forms in matter outside from itself. When this\nstage of intellection is attained, the actual intellect becomes the\nso-called “acquired” intellect (al-Fārābī\nLI: 19–21; LC: 216–217; OI: 72–73). \nWhereas forms linked to matter have to be abstracted in order to\nbecome actual intelligibles in the actual intellect, the process of\nabstraction is not required in the case of forms separate from matter,\nthat is, the separate entities that belong to the supralunar realm.\nThese separate forms are grasped by the intellect not as actual\nintellect but as the acquired intellect, and thus become forms for it.\nMoreover, the acquired intellect is a perfection of the human\nintellect because it has no need to perform the activity of\nabstraction in order to grasp forms existing separately from matter.\nIn other words, it is the acquired intellect that enables the grasping\nof separate forms through the assistance of the active intellect.\nEvidently, this view differs from Aristotle’s original stance,\nsince al-Fārābī, once again following Alexander, links\npsychology and cosmology, that is, the acquired intellect and the\nactive intellect.  \nRegarding the active intellect, as mentioned in the first section,\nthis intellect is a separate form, which is not linked to matter, and\nhas never been and never will be. According to\nal-Fārābī, in its species the active intellect is an\nactual intellect quite similar to the acquired intellect. The active\nintellect is what turns the material intellect into an actual\nintellect and what turns the potential intelligibles into actual\nintelligibles. To describe the assistance of the active intellect in\nthis process, al-Fārābī resorts to the well-known\nanalogy of light, used by Aristotle in On the Soul 3, which\nraised a great deal of discussion among late ancient and medieval\ncommentators of Aristotle. \nThe way al-Fārābī builds the referred analogy echoes\nAlexander and Themistius (Davidson 1992: 50). Al-Fārābī\ndescribes the relationship of the active intellect and the material\nintellect as that held between the sun and sight\n(al-Fārābī LI: 24–27; LC: 218–219; OI:\n74–75). As H. A. Davidson (1992: 50–51) states, the\nanalogy is built upon Aristotle’s theory of vision, but\nal-Fārābī stresses the sun as the source of the\n light.[7]\n Therefore, al-Fārābī equates the sun as the source of\nlight with the active intellect, and not with the light itself. In\nthis sense, following Davidson’s description, the light from the\nsun does four things: (1) it enters the eye and turns its potential\nvision into actual vision; (2) it enables potentially visible colors\nto become visible in actuality; (3) it itself becomes visible to the\neye; and (4) it renders the sun, its source, visible to the eye. The\nanalogy works as follows: (1) the active intellect turns the material\nor passive intellect into intellect in actuality; (2) it transforms\npotential intelligibles (sense impressions stored in the imaginative\nfaculty) into actual intelligibles; (3) it itself becomes an\nintelligible object for the human intellect; and (4) it renders the\nactive intellect as an intelligible object for the human intellect.\nWith this analogy al-Fārābī suggests that the active\nintellect provides some sort of illumination or flow of light by which\nthe human intellect is actualized enabling it to grasp the forms by\nabstraction. \nThrough the intellective process described, the active intellect makes\nthe forms that are in matter progressively more immaterial and brings\nabout the acquired intellect. Since the acquired intellect is of the\nsame sort as the active intellect, the human intellect thus becomes\nprogressively closer to the active intellect. In the view of\nal-Fārābī, this is precisely the ultimate goal and\nhappiness (sa‘ādah) of human beings, and\nconstitutes the way in which they attain definitive perfection:\nthrough the intellectual process the acquired intellect gradually\nbecomes a substance that performs the action by virtue of which it\nrealizes itself fully as substance and, in this way, remains in\nexistence in the afterlife (hayāh al-ākhīrah)\n(al-Fārābī LI: 27; 31–32; LC: 219–220; OI:\n75–76). Through this gradual process of perfection, the acquired\nintellect ends up acting only within itself, equating its own action\nwith its own existence. When this stage is reached, the body is no\nlonger needed as its matter in order to subsist, whereas it was\ninitially needed for actions such as sensation and imagination to take\nplace. Hence, the most perfect state the intellect can achieve is when\nit can subsist independently from the body. Nevertheless, the way in\nwhich al-Fārābī understood the relation between the\nacquired and agent intellects, was harshly criticized by Averroes who\njudged it impossible to conceive the transformation of the material\nintellect within the perishable human being into an immaterial and\neternal substance at the level of the agent intellect (Averroes LCD:\n387–388).  \nAs mentioned in the previous section, the term ‘aql\n(intellect) is used in different ways. We have dealt with the way in\nwhich al-Fārābī uses it in the psychological context of\nAristotle’s treatise On the Soul. However, in his\naccount of the different senses of the term, al-Fārābī\nalso refers to its use in Posterior Analytics 2.19, where\nAristotle uses the term νοῦς in an\nepistemological context when he talks about a faculty of the soul by\nmeans of which certainty about necessary, true, and universal premises\nis attained. In his Aphorisms al-Fārābī\ndescribes the theoretical intellect in the same terms when he says\nthat this intellect  \nis the faculty by which we attain by nature, and not by examination or\nsyllogistic reasoning, certain knowledge concerning the necessary,\nuniversal premises that are principles of the sciences.\n(al-Fārābī SA: §34, 28–29) \nBy “principles of the sciences”, al-Fārābī\nrefers to principles such as ‘the whole is greater than the\npart,’ ‘amounts equal to a single amount are mutually\nequal,’ and premises of this kind, following Aristotle\nexplicitly once again. These premises are the first point from which a\nthing is known or comes to be known (Aristotle Metaphysics 5,\n1013a18). As explained earlier, the human intellect passes from\npotency to act through the assistance of the active intellect, and\nwhen the intellect in act becomes acquired intellect and reaches the\ncapacity to understand on its own, this means that it already has the\nactual disposition to infer and reason by itself. In other words, the\nintellect has attained the habit of knowledge, and therefore is able\nto attain scientific knowledge (‘ilm).\nAl-Fārābī’s understanding of “scientific\nknowledge”, has nothing to do with the modern notion of\n“science”; rather he is using Aristotle’s notion of\napodeixis, that is, a type of knowledge that guarantees\ncertainty, and is confined to mathematics and metaphysics. In this\nrespect, Aristotle and the Aristotelian tradition after him are far\nfrom modern experimental science, since the main concern of the former\nis the attainment of absolute certainty. According to\nal-Fārābī, scientific knowledge is a virtue of the\ntheoretical intellect that enables the rational soul to attain\ncertainty about those beings whose existence and constitution do not\ndepend on human artifice, as well as what those beings are and how\nthey are,  \nfrom demonstrations composed of accurate, necessary, and primary\npremises of which the intellect becomes certain and attains knowledge\nby nature. (al-Fārābī SA: §35, 29)  \nThis language resembles that found in Posterior Analytics\n2.19, and also in Nicomachean Ethics 6.3. \nFollowing al-Fārābī’s explanation of\n‘ilm in his Aphorisms, there are two types of\nscientific knowledge: (1) becoming certain of the existence and the\nreason of the existence of a thing, and why it cannot possibly be\notherwise; and (2) becoming certain of the existence of a thing and\nwhy it cannot be something else, but without considering the reason\nfor its existence. \nAl-Fārābī goes on to define scientific knowledge as\nbeing accurate, certain, and steadfast in any given moment, which\nmeans it does not change through time and does not go in and out of\nexistence. Certainty cannot contain doubt and falsehood, since what\ncan in any way be false cannot be considered certain or be said to be\nknowledge. For this very reason, al-Fārābī points out\nthat the ancients did not consider sensation of what can change as\nknowledge; rather, scientific knowledge is confined to the\n“certainty” about the existence of things that cannot\npossibly change. In order to explain this al-Fārābī\noffers the example of the number three being always an odd number, and\nhow it cannot be otherwise. \nThe notion of “certainty” (yaqīn) has a\nrelevant place in al-Fārābī’s epistemology and is\nlinked also to his conception of the logical arts. In fact, he\nunderstands logic (manṭiq) as a tool\n(ālah) that leads to certainty when used correctly. He\nconceives five logical arts: demonstration, dialectic, sophistry,\nrhetoric, and poetics (al-Fārābī ES: 37–45).\nDialectic engenders belief (ẓann) through arguments\nbuilt upon generally-accepted opinions; sophistry is a logical art\nthat makes general opinions appear true; rhetoric persuades by means\nof appealing elocutions; poetics persuades by means of alluring or\nrepulsive images; finally, demonstration, the highest of the logical\narts, leads to certainty by means of universal and necessary\n premises.[8]\n The non-demonstrative logical arts—dialectic, sophistry,\nrhetoric, and poetics—engender opinion in different degrees\nwhereas, in contrast, demonstration engenders certainty. However, in\nsome places al-Fārābī admits that it could be the case\nthat these non-demonstrative arts would lead to assent to beliefs in a\nway very close to certainty (al-Fārābī KB: 20–21;\nBD: 64–65). For this reason, as D. Black (2006: 11–45) has\npointed out, it is important to distinguish in\nal-Fārābī between “certainty”\n(yaqīn) and “absolute certainty”\n(al-yaqīn ‘alā al-iṭlāq).  \nThere are two works where al-Fārābī treats the notion\nof absolute certainty in detail. The first is his Book of\nDemonstration (Kitāb al-burhān) and the second\nis the Book on the Conditions of Certitude (Kitāb\nŠara’iṭ al-yaqīn). In both treatises\nal-Fārābī provides some conditions for absolute\ncertainty. The second treatise contains an exhaustive account of these\nconditions, six in number: (1) to believe that something is in some\nway and not another, (2) to agree that this belief corresponds and is\nnot opposed to the external existence of the thing, (3) to know the\ncorrespondence between the belief of the existence and the existence\nof the thing in reality, (4) to know that it is not possible for this\ncorrespondence to happen and there to be opposition, (5) to know that\nopposition between belief and reality cannot happen at any time, and\n(6) to know that all this is not accidental, but essential\n(al-Fārābī KY: 98). According to D. Black (2006: 16),\nthese conditions can be understood as follows: \nD. Black realizes that al-Fārābī’s first three\nconditions for certainty seem to evoke the traditional tripartite\ndefinition of knowledge as “justified true belief”, an\nessential and debated notion in contemporary epistemology. However, as\nD. Black herself notices, in al-Fārābī the\njustification condition, that is, ‘having good reasons or\nsufficient evidence to believe something,’ is replaced by the\nknowledge condition and, in this sense, knowledge itself becomes a\nnecessary ingredient within certainty, and therefore is insufficient\nfor raising a belief to the status of absolute certainty. For this\nreason, certainty for al-Fārābī requires two conditions\nfrom the knower: (1) to know that a proposition x is true, and\n(2) to know that she knows. This is very close, as D. Black notices,\nto what contemporary epistemology calls “second\norder-knowledge” (Black 2006: 19–21).  \nIn the Book of Demonstration al-Fārābī states\nthat the goal of scientific demonstration is precisely absolute or\nnecessary certainty (al-Fārābī KB: 26; BD: 68). In a\nvery short treatise entitled Introductory Letter on Logic\n(Risālah sudira bihā al-kitāb)\nal-Fārābī writes:  \nPhilosophical discourse is called demonstrative. It seeks to teach and\nmake clear the truth in the things which are such that they afford\ncertain knowledge. (al-Fārābī IR: 231)  \nIt seems, therefore, that al-Fārābī has a strict\nconception of demonstrative science inspired by Aristotle’s\nPosterior Analytics. Nevertheless, although\nal-Fārābī gives demonstration and absolute certainty a\nrelevant place in his conception of philosophy, he also considers that\nour knowledge is not limited to absolute certainty. He also takes into\nconsideration other forms of knowledge that can lead us to what should\nbe called non-necessary certainty, as is the case with the different\nkinds of knowledge we attain by means of the non-demonstrative logical\narts. In this regard, al-Fārābī considers that from the\ndifferent kinds of arguments we can conceive different degrees of\ncertainty and therefore, different kinds of beliefs (from absolute\ncertainty to non-necessary certainty or strong belief).","contact.mail":"llopez@up.edu.mx","contact.domain":"up.edu.mx"}]
