He was born in Ancemont and in 1636 became a monk\nin the Benedictine order. He taught theology at Saint-Evre at Toul\nbetween 1635–1655, and served as Procurer General of Mihiel to Paris\nduring 1648–49. Although he is little-known today, he played an\nimportant role in the development and transmission of the Cartesian\nphilosophy, especially in Paris and Toulouse. He is best known for his\nrole in the theological controversy over the Cartesian explication of\nthe Eucharist (Desgabets, 1671), and for his defense of Nicolas\nMalebranche against the skeptic Simon Foucher (Desgabets, 1675). His\nmajor philosophical writings were not published until\n 1983.[1] His\ncontributions in natural philosophy include pioneering work in the\nstudy of blood transfusion and mechanics. His unusual marriage of\nCartesianism and empiricism challenges many standard views of\nDescartes and the Cartesian philosophy.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough Robert Desgabets (1610–1678) is perhaps the most original of\nthe Cartesian thinkers, even lauded by his most famous student,\nPierre-Sylvain Régis, as “one of the greatest metaphysicians of\nour century” (Regis, 1704, p. 328), only one book and two small works\nwere published during his\n lifetime.[2]\n His correspondence indicates that he was interested in mechanics\nbefore 1644, prior to his acquaintance with the writings of Descartes.  For a\nmetaphysical thinker like Desgabets, it was Descartes, not Galileo or\nBacon, who offered a new and complete philosophic system. In\nDesgabets’s estimation, the only legitimate rival system to\nDescartes’s was the one developed by Pierre Gassendi, but in the final\nanalysis, the “new scientific discoveries” weighed decisively in Descartes’s\nfavor. \n\nIn 1658 Desgabets participated in the Cartesian conferences held at\nM. de Montmort’s, where he reportedly participated in discussions with\nRohault, Clerselier, and Cordemoy. Desgabets delivered a lecture which\noutlined his invention of an apparatus and procedure for blood\ntransfusion, but he seems to have abandoned its study shortly\nthereafter. In 1667, after a controversy erupted between the English\nand the French over who first invented the procedure, a physician by\nthe name of Jean Denis was spurred to publish the written version of\nDesgabets’s lecture. This appeared in 1668, four years after the\nphysicians Clark and Henshaw of England had attempted the operation on\nanimals without success (Desgabets, 1668). Prior to this research, in\n1656, Christopher Wren successfully injected medications directly into\nthe veins of animals, after which in 1665, another Englishman and\nphysician, Richard Lower, a teacher and friend of John Locke, successfully\ninjected blood into animals using this same method. Genevieve Rodis-Lewis has\nsorted out many of the details of this history, and shows that the two\nprocedures created by Lower and Desgabets are so different as to\nconfirm the independence of their inventions (Rodis-Lewis, 1974). But\nwhether and when Desgabets experimented with his procedure has not been\nfirmly established. What is evident, however, is that Desgabets, like\nWren, was inspired by Harvey’s discovery of the circulation of blood.\nOnce Harvey had shown how the circulation of blood is best understood\nas a mechanism operating according to lawful movements, he opened the\nway for blood transfusion to be understood along similar lines, as a\nspecies of the communication of movement. Where evidence of Desgabets’s\nactual experimentation with blood transfusion is lacking, his\ndescriptions of it show that he was aware of the possibility of shock\nif the quantities transferred were too great for the subject\n(Rodis-Lewis, 1974). \n\nThroughout his lifetime Desgabets engaged in many theological and\nphilosophical controversies with such distinguished\nseventeenth-century thinkers as Mabillon, Rapin, Foucher, Malebranche,\nCordemoy, Arnauld and Poisson. One of his more famous interlocutors\nwas the Cartesian Gérauld de Cordemoy\n(1626–1684). Despite his admiration for Cordemoy, Desgabets was\nshocked by the atomism in the Discernement du corps et de\nl’âme (1666), a copy of which had been sent to him by\nClerselier. Desgabets subsequently wrote to Clerselier, opposing\nCordemoy’s arguments in favor of the existence of the void and\nagainst the infinite divisibility of extension. According to\nDesgabets, the marriage of Cartesian and anti-Cartesian elements in\nthis work formed an irreconcilable schism in the Cartesian\nphilosophy. Although Desgabets himself was not one to adopt\nCartesianism in its entirety, in his view his own criticisms perfected\nand maintained the integrity of the Cartesian principles, while\nCordemoy’s adoption of atoms and the void was a direct affront\nto the Cartesian \nmetaphysics.[3] \n\nAnother, much more scandalous interchange took place between Desgabets\nand Thomas Le Géant between 1671–1672 over\nDesgabets’s thoughts on the Eucharist, which he stated in an\nanonymous work, the second of his publications,\nConsidérations sur l’état présent de la\ncontroverse touchant le T. S. Sacrement de l’autel\n(1671). Lemaire credited this work with having been the primary cause\nof the persecution of Cartesianism in France, since it brought to\nlight the incompatibility of the Cartesian philosophy with the\nofficial Church doctrine on the mystery of the Eucharist (Lemaire,\n1901, p. 124). Desgabets had entered this on-going debate in 1654 at\nClerselier’s request. Desgabets’s intention was to defend\nthe Cartesian doctrine of material substance against the Peripatetic\ndoctrine of substantial forms in his explication of\ntransubstantiation. Clerselier and Rohault had defended\nDescartes’s ideas on the subject along similar lines, but no one\nhad been willing, either privately or publicly, to argue as Desgabets\neventually did, that the body of Christ is really extended in the\nhost. In addition, Desgabets’s persistence and perhaps even\nimprudence, pushed the issue into the open. For, it was shortly after\nthe publication of the anonymous Considérations in\n1671, that Desgabets sent additional writings on the topic to Abbey Le\nRoi, who communicated them to Nicole and Arnauld. The latter found\nDesgabets’s views dangerous and completely against tradition. It\nwas through his acquaintance with Nicole and Arnauld, that the\nnon-Cartesian Le Géant learned of the document and the identity\nof its author. Le Géant alerted the Procurer General of the\nCongregation of Benedictines, who ordered Desgabets to report to his\nsuperiors concerning the matter. This led to an interrogation and the\nsubsequent issuance of an order on the 15th of December 1672, which\ndemanded that Desgabets renounce his views on the Eucharist\n(Armogathe, 1977, pp. 104–105; Lemaire, pp. 51,\n127–128). Desgabets promised to obey, and retreated to a\nmonastery at Breuil. Fortunately this did not end his philosophical\nwork. The controversy attracted the attention of Cardinal de Retz, who\nwas known for his radical spirit of reform among conservative\necclesiastics in France. Cardinal de Retz, who was a partisan of the\nnew Cartesian philosophy, provided protection for Desgabets and\ninvited him to the Cartesian conferences held at Chateau de\nCommercy. It was here that Desgabets criticized and corrected what he\nsaw as the errors of Descartes, and completed his\n“indefectibility thesis,” which he had started in\n1653–1654. \n\nDesgabets’s last published work, Critique de la critique de\nla Recherche de la vérité (1675), was intended as a\ndefence of Malebranche against the sceptic Simon Foucher. However,\nMalebranche did not share this assessment, writing that although he\nwas pleased with the person, he was not pleased with the contents of\nhis book; he further lamented that Desgabets ought to have better\nunderstood his ideas before taking on a defense. Desgabets himself was\nnever to see Malebranche’s scolding response which was published\nin the “Advertissement” of the third edition of the\nSearch After Truth (Malebranche, 1958–84, v2,\npp. 500–503), since Desgabets died at Breuil on March 13, 1678,\njust fourteen days before it appeared. \n\nDesgabets’s most important Cartesian text, Supplément\nà la philosophie de M. Descartes (1675), was intended as a\nsupplement to Descartes’s Meditations. In this work, Desgabets\nexamines many of Descartes’s important doctrines and arguments.\nDesgabets defends the Cartesian doctrines of sensible qualities,\nmatter, mind-body dualism, mind-body union and interaction in man while\ncriticizing Descartes’s argument for the cogito as the first\nprinciple of knowledge, the claim that there is such a process as pure\nintellection, that there are innate ideas, and that ideas have\nobjective reality (pure possibility). What is particularly interesting\nis the central importance that Desgabets gives to the role of sensation\nin knowledge, and his development of Descartes’s treatment of truth as\nboth eternal and immutable but in some sense (one much contested in the\nliterature) contingent. Desgabets more than once remarks in this work\nthat “M. Descartes is not always a good Cartesian,” which typifies his\nconviction that Cartesianism is more than the sum of the particulars\nset down by Descartes himself.  Viewing Desgabets’s work as a whole, there is no doubt that\nwhat he viewed as a revision or perfection of the Cartesian philosophy\nothers have viewed as a fundamental departure. In his favor, he never\nstrayed from the Cartesian metaphysics, i.e., its substance dualism of\nmind and matter, substance-mode ontology, mind-body union and\ninteraction, and the view that extension is the essence of matter and\nthought the essence of mind; and he remained loyal to the Cartesian\nphysics against the atomists. However, heretically to some, he\nstrongly rejected the rationalist epistemology which often dominates\nin Descartes, and argued that Descartes’s own principles favor a\nsensory foundation for knowledge. \n\nDespite the originality of many of Desgabets’s ideas, he was orthodox\nin his Cartesianism (Watson, 1966; 1987). Desgabets adhered strictly to\nDescartes’s doctrine of matter as body extended in three dimensions.\nPhysics, as Desgabets conceived it, was both mathematically and\nmetaphysically grounded in the solid of the geometer. He also\nmaintained the substance dualism of mind and matter while retaining\ntheir causal interaction. And he, like Descartes, insisted upon the\nsubstantial unity of man and the specificity of his nature and defended\nthe Cartesian interpretation of ideas against such non-orthodox\nCartesians as Malebranche. Although he claimed that the nature of the\nmind-body union is “the most impenetrable thing in the world,” he had\nmuch to say about its sensory basis and its operations.   Desgabets subscribed completely to the Cartesian doctrine of\nmatter as a substance extended in length, width, and breadth. It was\nposited against the prevailing Peripatetic view that posits prime\nmatter and substantial forms in order to explain the permanence\nunderlying the continuous change that matter undergoes. On\nDescartes’s view, the essence of matter is its extension in\nthree dimensions, and all of its changing attributes, properties and\nmodes, such as movement, rest, figure, situation and composition of\nparts, are completely dependent upon and follow from this unified\nextension (OPD 2: 27). Matter, or corporeal substance, is clearly\nknown when it is viewed as the geometrical object of mathematicians,\nas a magnitude extended in length, width and breadth.  Likewise,\ncorporeal bodies are best viewed as the movements, rest, figures,\narrangements and sizes of which corporeal substance is capable, and\nwhich, in its various diversifications and assemblages,\n“… now pass for the form of all particular bodies of\nwhich the world is composed” (OPD 1: 3). And, in all of this,\n“… there is nothing which is not governed by the laws of\nmechanics” (OPD 2: 4). \n\nFurthermore, Desgabets viewed bodies as portions of matter, which in\nthe case of animals are highly delicate and organized machines composed\nof an infinite number of parts capable of an infinite diversity of\nmovements. He held this view against that of the Peripatetics who\nbelieved that there must be an internal principle of thought in beasts\nbecause of the intricacy and apparent human-like intelligence of their\nmovements. According to Desgabets, the kind of thinking that attributes\nsuch an internal principle to beasts is the same kind of thinking that\nresults in the attribution of intelligence to clocks, “However, the\nsame affront to reason and philosophy is committed by the Americans and\nthe Barbarians of the Orient who not being able to understand the\nmechanical reasons for the movement of clocks, or the true causes of\nnatural effects, attribute souls and intelligence to machines, and\nlikewise to fire, lakes etc., and in doing so expose themselves to the\nmockery of Europeans” (OPD 4: 132–133). In other words, no appeal to\ninternal principles, or final causes is required to explain the\nmovements of beasts, any more than it is needed to explain the\nmovements of clocks. The complexity of movements, whether involved in\nthe operations of clocks or those of animate bodies, is explicable in\npurely mechanistic terms. \n\nLikewise, all motions communicated within or between material bodies\nare effected by physical contact and proceed according to the laws of\nlocal motion. Desgabets was careful to stress that the ultimate source\nof movement is not matter but God, who imparted motion to the universe in\nits creation. For Desgabets, it is this fact that grounds the laws of\nnature: “It is the constant and uniform manner of the action of God\nwhich founds these laws, by means of which He forms and maintains this\nbeautiful harmony in the world which is one of the greatest objects of\nour sciences” (OPD 1: 13). As Desgabets saw it, the operation of these\nlaws of nature and the rules of the communication of movement were the\ntrue and unique foundations of the new physics.  Desgabets also subscribed to the Cartesian conception of mind as\nan immaterial substance whose essence is thought. The distinction\nbetween mind and matter is thus a real and substantial one, impossible\nnot to perceive: “Never has an infant asked for lies or truths\nfor breakfast, nor has he imagined that the stones encountered along\nhis path were the gross thoughts of some countryman” (OPD 5:\n197). Minds, or immaterial substances, are of three kinds: uncreated,\nwhich is God; mind detached from body, which is an angel; and mind\nunited with organized body, which is a reasonable soul. The second of\nthese, angels, are the only pure minds in the created universe and\nthey have no corporeal extension, no local presence or correspondence\nto time—they are simple and indivisible minds. Such minds or\nspirits cannot be perfected by any substantial union since their\nspecific spiritual being does not require anything corporeal to carry\nout its functions.  However, they are capable of participating in the\nmovements of the visible world, though in doing so, they must undergo\na kind of degradation and punishment in order to receive pain. The\nthird of these spiritual beings is man, who consists of a cross\nbetween purely intellectual and purely corporeal things. In this\nDesgabets appears to have strayed slightly from the official Cartesian\ndoctrine of dual substances, since he claimed that outside of God\nthere are three sorts of simple created substances, matter or body,\nangel, and one which is composed of body and soul, which is\nman. However, this tripartite division of substances is supported by a\nmore fundamental bipartite division of material and spiritual\nsubstances, so that man is best understood as a state of being which\nemerges out of the conjunction of two substances, rather than as a\nsubstance in the primary sense. This is not unlike Descartes’s\naccount of man as a “composite entity” possessing two\nprinciple attributes, namely extension and thought, a being which\nitself is not a simple substance. Nonetheless, in Desgabets as in\nDescartes, how to interpret the human soul as as substance (Miller,\n2008), or as a modal being (Lennon, 1994), is contentious. \n\nIt was an important point for Desgabets that man, unlike angels, is a\nbeing composed of body and soul, who continually experiences\nthe union of the two substances by the endless impressions he finds in\nhimself. The relation of mind and body in man is an essential one\nwhich must not be regarded as a penal state of the soul, but as the\naccomplishment of its natural perfection. Human thought has\nduration, succession, a beginning and an end—qualities that\ndepend on the movements of the corporeal organs and which follow the\nrules of local movement. Although Descartes and Malebranche after him\nclaimed that the human mind is capable of detachment from the body,\nDesgabets rejected this, since the human mind is not like an\nangel’s but requires continual commerce with the body and its\nsenses for all its operations. \n\nOne further issue concerning Descartes’s general account of the\nnature of the mind-body union, which Desgabets raised in order to\ndispel, concerns the common complaint that the Cartesian view fails to\naccount for the interaction of material and immaterial substances.\nDesgabets did not regard this as a true problem because he thought\nthat the question demanded the impossible—an explanation of how\nthe organized body and reasonable soul, which are in fact made for\neach other, can exercise a mutual commerce. He likened this\nto asking an artisan to explain how the convex surface of a peg\ncan possibly fill that of a concave hole. It is akin to\nasking why extension is the essence of body, or why thought is the\nessence of mind. It’s just the way God made the world. \n\nWhat could be explained, according to Desgabets, is the way in which\nthe mind and body are united and dependent upon one another. He found\nan analogue in the nature of the body-body relation: two bodies are\nunited when their superficies touch and their movements take on a\nmutual dependence. Similarly, two minds are united when their thoughts\nand wills agree and depend on one another. The union of mind and body\nis not by touch, nor by agreement of thoughts, but by the dependence\nthat exists between certain thoughts and certain movements such that\none in fact follows from the other. The union of the mind and\nbody in man is so strict that it founds a species of communication for\ntheir commerce, in virtue of which our thoughts are said to have\nduration, succession, etc., without themselves being corporeal. The\nunion and its interaction cannot be further reduced in explanation. In\nshort, the essence of man, who is composed of mind and body,\nis the union of mind and body, and the only legitimate\nquestions which concern this union relate to how, given the\nunion, the mind determines the body and the body determines the mind,\nwhich is an empirical question, known through experience not\nreason. \nDesgabets’s thesis concerning the indefectibility of created\nsubstances, which underlies his metaphysics, is perhaps his most\noriginal if not radical philosophical contribution (Schmaltz, 2002;\nEaston, 2005; Gatto, 2017). Gatto argues that this thesis is the key to\nunderstanding Desgabets’s peculiar development of\nDescartes’s philosophy (Gatto, 2017). In a letter from Desgabets\nto Malebranche, we learn that he had begun the Treatise on the\nIndefectibility of Substances, as early as 1649 (Letter from\nDesgabets, Sept. 1674, Malebranche, 1958–84, vol. II: 85). It was\nDesgabets’s view that substances, in their essence and\nexistence, are eternal, indivisible, immutable, and indestructible,\nwhich is to say, indefectible. While the modes of substance can\nundergo change, the essence of substance and its existence\ncannot. According to Desgabets, the indestructibility, eternality, and\nindivisibility of substances follow from the fact that God created\nsubstances by a free and indifferent will. Once the world was created,\nit could not be uncreated. Thus, the key to understanding\nDesgabets’s indefectibility thesis lies not only in his analysis\nof the Cartesian doctrine of substance, but in his interpretation of\nDescartes’s notoriously opaque doctrine of the free creation of\nthe eternal truths, discussed in a later section, under “Truth.”   We can see Desgabets adoption of the new Cartesian philosophy in\nhis adherence to the core Cartesian metaphysics of dualism, mechanism,\nand union, and his critique of the Scholastic doctrines. However, his\ndevelopment of the doctrine of matter in the Eucharist controversy,\nhis development of the interaction of mind and body as essential for\nall operations of the human mind, his development of the doctrine of\nindefectibility especially with respect to matter, and his defense of\nthe “Creation Doctrine” led to many controversies in his day. Each of\nthese, particularly the metaphysics of the human being as a\nsubstantial union of mind and matter whose interaction underlies all\nour thoughts has some interesting epistemological consequences. It is\nnot surprising that Desgabets was known for his spirit of reform and\nearned Regis’s title as “one of the greatest metaphysicians of\nour century.”  \n\nIn Desgabets’s estimation, Descartes’s truly great\ndiscovery was his identification of the true nature of sensible\nqualities (OPD 5: 164).  As Desgabets understood it, sensible\nqualities “… are nothing else in objects but the local\ndispositions of the small parts from which result the sensations that\nwe call heat, sound, light, etc.” (OPD 2: 17).  Moreover,\nsensible qualities qua modes of the mind have no resemblance\nor similarity to the modes or accidents of matter. Sensible qualities\nare states or modes of the human mind having only a causal relation to\nthe specific local movements of our sensory organs, which in turn, are\nthe effects of the local movements produced by the arrangements and\nlocal dispositions of parts of matter. Unfortunately, the ontological\nstatus of these qualities becomes less clear when they are considered\nas qualities in objects. In this context, for both Descartes and\nDesgabets, sensible qualities are “various dispositions”\nin objects. Since Descartes clearly held that sensible qualties are\nnot the forms of material things but rather modes of the mind, the\nonly sense in which sensible qualites could be “in” the\nvarious dispositions of objects is in the causal sense, that is, as\ntheir effects. While the status and nature of these dispositions in\nDescartes’s account has been a subject of much debate, it is\nclear that he distinguished between such qualities as light, colour,\nsmell, taste, sound and touch, which are sensed or perceived\nqualities, and other qualities, such as size, shape and motion, which\nare found in all bodies. Descartes wrote that the former qualities are\ndispositions which depend on size, shape and motion. So, it would seem\nthat for Descartes, secondary qualities are sensible qualities bearing\nno resemblance to qualities of matter, while primary qualities are\nqualities belonging to physical objects.  \n\nThe importance of this discovery and its interpretation in Desgabets’s\nthought is paramount, since he believed that because of it, the way\nhad been opened at last to lay the foundations of a true\nphilosophy. Based on Descartes’s conception of matter, and his\nconsequent discovery of the true nature of sensible qualities,\nDesgabets concluded that our perception of sensible qualities and\nsensible objects does not constitute knowledge of the true\nstate of exterior things. In fact, sensible qualities and objects\nconsidered in relation to their being as modes of the mind are not the\ntrue objects of knowledge or of science, since they are only modal\nbeings subject to change. In this, Descartes would concur. But\nDesgabets went on to argue that all (true) knowledge depends on the\nsenses, and hence on our perception of these sensible qualities and\nobjects; this is a point of great contention in Descartes scholarship,\nand one of much significance and growing contention in understanding\nDesgabets’s marriage of Cartesianism and empiricism. The story is a\nsomewhat complicated and intricate, and scholars disagree about the\nnature of the empiricism. There is a long tradition of interpreting\nDesgabets as an empiricist from Victor Cousin (1852), and Francisque\nBouillier (1868), to Genevieve Rodis-Lewis (1981, 1993), Patricia\nEaston and Thomas Lennon (1992), Tad Schmaltz (2002a; 2002b) and Sean\nAllen-Hermenson (2008). Monte Cook (2008) has raised an important\nchallenge to the empiricist reading, questioning whether the senses\nprovide any real content to our ideas. Despite the ongoing\ndisagreements, there is consensus that Desgabets held that the eternal\ntruths are contingent not necessary, rejected hyperbolic doubt and\npure intellection, and insisted on the necessary role of sensible\nsigns in the formation of all ideas. Each of these positions leans\naway from Descartes in varying degrees and while perhaps not a\nLockean-type empiricism can be seen as an attempt to develop a\nposition somewhere in between, a kind of Cartesian empiricism.  \n\nDesgabets claimed that the corporeal form of all particular bodies\nresults from an assemblage of the local dispositions\nof matter, and that these dispositions of matter in turn come from\nextended matter. Thus, in the same way that sensible qualities are\nnothing outside us but the local dispositions of matter, sensible\nobjects are nothing outside us but assemblages of local\ndispositions of matter. If sensible qualities such as heat, colour and\nlight are really modes of the mind which have no resemblance to the\nmodes or accidents of matter that cause them then, for the same reason,\nsensible bodies such as earth, water and animals must also be modes of\nthe mind that have no resemblance to the assemblages of local\ndispositions of matter that cause them. This is a simple but\nperspicuous consequence of the Cartesian doctrine of sensible qualities\nand its conception of matter. It treats particular bodies as\nassemblages of local dispositions of matter, and it treats sensible\nbodies as our grasp of those assemblages. Hence, sensible bodies are\nbeings of the mind which are merely caused by assemblages of local\ndispositions of matter. The analogy between sensible qualities such as\nheat, light etc., and sensible bodies such as earth, water, animals\netc., is meant to be an exact one. Just as sensible qualities are the\nimmediate effects of local dispositions of matter acting upon the\nsenses, sensible bodies are the immediate effects of assemblages of\nlocal dispositions of matter acting upon the senses. \n\nAnother important consequence of the true nature of sensible\nqualities is that the senses are not the source of error. This is a\ntheme found in Descartes that depends on an important distinction\nbetween the scope of the two basic operations of the mind—that of\nthe intellect and that of the will. The functions of assenting and\ndissenting are performed only by the will, while those of perception\nand conception are performed by the senses and intellect. For\nDesgabets, as for Descartes, simple conception is always true and\nconforms to its object, while error is a product of precipitous\njudgement. But unlike Descartes, Desgabets concluded that\neverything that is conceived of is a simple conception, not\njust God, soul and body. For Desgabets, a thing truly conceived,\nactually exists. Errors and so-called beings of reason which are said\nnot to exist outside our conceptions, are not really conceptions, and\nare “… nothing but a false judgement which extends itself beyond\nperception. Likewise the failure that is often attributed to the senses\nis equally nothing but a precipitous judgement by which one says that\nthe senses do not know” (OPD 6: 227). According to Desgabets, after\nhaving distinguished simple ideas from judgement in the Third\nMeditation, Descartes erred gravely in placing chimeras and other\nsuch beings of reason among the number of objects of simple conception.\nIt was this that led to Descartes’s fundamental error—the\nreversal of the basic truth that the first operation of the mind has\nonly real things for its object. By including chimerical\nbeings among the objects of conception Descartes opened the door to the\npossibility of thoughts without true objects. But, judgement or the\nextension of the will beyond the domain of what is conceived is the\ntrue source of chimeras and error (OPD 4: 103). \n\nAll conceptions conform to their object, and error consists in the\nwill forming a judgement beyond conception. On this point, Desgabets’s\naccount of error looks very much like that found in Descartes. However,\nin Desgabets, the domain of simple conception is less restricted, as is\nthe proper function of the senses. The senses not only serve to\ndetermine what is good or harmful in life, but they also serve in\nknowing the nature of things. However, we often form false judgements\nof the true nature of the movements experienced by the senses because\nof their role in preserving life (OPD 6: 228). On Desgabets’s account,\nit is because the senses serve to promote the preservation of our life\nby telling us immediately which particular bodies are harmful or\nprofitable that they can not also provide immediate knowledge\nof the true nature of these movements that impinge upon us. If the\nsenses were such that they gave us immediate knowledge of the true\nnature of the movements impinging upon them, then they could not tell\nus at the same time what particular bodies are good or harmful\nto us. Thoughts are successive, and so the senses, in order to preserve\nlife by warding off immediate and unexpected dangers, must be able to\nrespond first and foremost to the preservation value of a particular\nobject. \n\nThis does not mean that the senses cannot access the true nature\nof things as well. In fact, for Desgabets, since all knowledge comes\nfrom the senses, the function of knowing the essences of things is a\nnecessary role served by the senses. Recall that the true nature of\nparticular objects consists in the local dispositions of parts of\nmatter which produce the course of the movements we experience. These\nmovements are the first and sole contact we have with the material\nworld, and so the senses present, in some form, not only the existence\nof a given object, but first and foremost, the value of that object in\nrelation to our survival. We only reach knowledge of the true nature of\nmaterial objects by considering their being in relation to their\nsubstance. In order to achieve this, we must abstract from all\nrelations of time, and only then see it as it is in itself. What the\nsenses offer us is knowledge of matter in its various divisions,\nshapes, sizes, etc., that is, as matter exists at a certain time and\nplace. Thus, what Desgabets seemed to have assumed was that the reason\nwe so often err with regard to the true nature of these movements is\nthat we judge precipitously, or too quickly, before the mind has had a\nchance to conceive of material substance as it is in itself,\nindependent of any temporal or spatial ties. Worth noting is that\nDesgabets’s explanation for the mind’s natural tendency to judge\nprecipitously derives from the other function of the senses, namely, to\nimmediately grasp the preservation value of a given object. \n\nBut what on Desgabets’s account is the difference between a simple\nconception and a precipitous judgement? What is the criterion for\ndistinguishing one from the other? In his Supplément,\nhe offers the example of imaginary space. When we speak of imaginary\nspace, many are persuaded that it does not include any judgement on\ntheir part, but if one looks closely, one sees that the simple object\nof conception here is space and extension with its perceived dimensions\nfrom which we form a judgement concerning its imaginary\nnature. Similarly, when someone approaches fire and has the sensation\nof heat, pain or pleasure, he may be persuaded that the heat he feels\nis in the fire just as he perceives it, since this sensation is known\nto him clearly. But, he has erred because of a tacit judgement. His\nconception of the fire and of the heat, as well as of his intervening\njudgement are all the immediate and true objects of his thought. These\nall qualify as simple conceptions in so far as they relate to their\ntrue object. But, that the heat is in the fire by which it is claimed\nthat the heat in us resembles that of the fire, is a tacit judgement\nwhich is false. In this sense, the illusions that are attributed to the\nsenses always involve false judgement. It is a genuine question to ask\nabout a baton partially submerged in water whether it is straight or\ncurved, but whether the baton, straightness, curvature etc., are real\nthings, is not. Simple conceptions are the mind’s grasp of things as\nthey are in themselves, which is to say, in relation to their essence\nas extended substances, or as thinking minds. Space, as an attribute of\nmatter, is extended in three dimensions, and sensations, as attributes\nof the mind, are perceptions not qualities of material objects. \n\nThis explains what Desgabets meant by his claim that all simple\nconceptions always have an existent object outside the understanding,\nsince simple conceptions are, in virtue of their relation to\nsubstances, of things which actually exist. It is only when\none judges of things outside one’s conception that one is erroneously\nsaid to conceive something which does not exist. The task in the search\nafter truth, then, is to separate precipitous judgements from\njudgements based only on what is simply, and hence, actually\nconceived. \n\nDesgabets drew yet another, final consequence from Descartes’s\ndiscovery of the true nature of sensible qualities (and bodies). This\nconsquence bears directly on our ability to see the right path to a\ntrue physics which was hitherto impossible. The true physics is one\nthat recognizes that “everything that happens in matter by the\ndifferent movements and modes of its parts, belongs to mathematics and\nmechanics, which have all of this for their object” (OPD 5:\n166). The object of the true physics is not the substantial forms of\nthe Scholastics, but matter whose essence is extension, and its modes\nwhich are nothing else but various divisions and groupings of its\nparts.  Thus, the natural object of the physcists is the same as the\nsolid of the mathematician. The solid of the mathematicians, according\nto Desgabets, consists in a magnitude that has three dimensions, i.e.,\nlength, width, and thickness while the natural body of the physicist\nconsists in a solid substance extended in three dimensions. This is\nthe crowning statement of Desgabets’s metaphysical view that the\nphysical world is really a single object or substance whose\nparts, under various divisions, shapes and arrangements, form all the\nappearances in the “grand theatre of nature” (OPD\n5: 166). \n\nThis, of course, does not make the world, or its particular\ninhabitants any less real (or any more phenomenal) in Desgabets’s view.\nQuite to the contrary, Desgabets thought that the foundation he had\nlaid out supports the natural realist in each of us. The individuation\nof matter into sensible objects is a mode of thought in so far as the\nmind gives particular objects (local assemblages of dispositions of\nmatter) their extrinsic form, but that such conceived or known objects\nactually exist outside the understanding by an intrinsic form, as modes\nor states of matter. \n\nIn Part 1, chapter three of the Supplément, Desgabets\nexplicitly examines Descartes’s rejection of the empiricist\nmotto, that all knowledge comes from the senses. While Desgabets\nrejects the Scholastic rendering of the motto, he is equally critical\nof Descartes’s precipitous rejection of it. According to\nDesgabets, the proper sense of the empiricist motto is that all\nthoughts originate by the senses [a sensu] rather\nthan in the senses [in sensu], and what reaches the intellect\nis not what is found in the senses. As Lennon nicely puts it, “For him\nthings are directly perceived and an idea is the means by which, and\nnot in which, a thing is perceived” (Lennon, 1998, p. 353). The soul\nmust always be in commerce with the senses, and although our thoughts\ndepend on the corporeal traces in the brain for their source or\norigin, it does not follow that our ideas must be corporeal, or even\nsimilar to corporeal things. The very fact that all of our thoughts\nhave a beginning, duration, cessation, and sucession proves that they\ndepend on motion, and motion is only communicated through the\nsenses. This is why he modifies the empiricist motto from: nihil\nest in intellectu quin prius fuerit in sensu, to a\nsensu. \n\nIt is not surprising then, that Desgabets argued against\nDescartes’s “pretention” that he could detach\nhimself from all commerce with the senses, which sets the rationalist\ntone of the Meditations. Of course, Descartes saw this\ndetachment as desirable because he thought it was in virtue of it that\nhe could defend the certainty of human knowledge. He thought that the\nsoul is known more clearly than the body because we, as thinking\nthings, are intimately tied to the immaterial, thinking substance,\nwhich is our soul. The body, on the other hand, is part of material\nnot immaterial substance, and so is not known immediately. It is\nbecause of this that Descartes erroneously took the cogito to\nbe the foundation of certainty in human knowledge, and our knowledge\nof body to be less clear and less immediate. However, according to\nDesgabets, this is where Descartes goes terribly astray. Had Descartes\nreflected more deeply on the nature of the mind-body union, he would\nhave seen that our ideas of body and mind are equally clear, and\nequally evident. For, the soul of man is not an immaterial substance,\nbut a result of the union of mind and body, and all our ideas, even of\nthe soul, equally depend upon the operation of the senses. From here,\nthe new foundation of certainty can be seen to be the principle of\nintentionality, that to think is to think of something.\nClarity and distinctness, according to Desgabets, tells us when we\nhave grasped something truthfully, but the intentionality of thought\ngrounds clarity and distinctness.   According to Desgabets, it is undeniable that man is a being who\nreasons, draws consequences, does not see things indivisibly, who has\nthoughts in succession which begin, continue, and finish, and who\noften experiences doubt and conjecture. Such doubting, discursive\nreasoning and succession of thought prove that all thought is tied to\nthe body since duration and successive extension are nothing but the\nlocal movements of the body (OPD 7: 299). A pure thought, the kind\nthat Descartes (and Malebranche after him) envisioned for metaphysical\nreasoning, would have no beginning, duration, end, or succession. In\nshort, such a thought would be indivisible, and hence unthinkable by\nthe human mind. Both Descartes and Malebranche rejected the empiricist\nthesis because they erroneously thought that it would commit them to\nthe materialist thesis that thoughts and the soul are material.  This\nled them to adopt the intellectualist thesis regarding the\nmind’s perception of metaphysical essences. However, Desgabets\nsaw a third option, one which is founded on the mind-body union and\nthe sensory basis of all knowledge, and one which founds the proper\nsense of the empiricist motto, that all ideas originate by the\nsenses. \n\nDesgabets, having declared that all thoughts depend on movement, was\nespecially concerned to defend his empiricist thesis against charges of\nmaterialism. Since movement is a mode belonging to body, many\ntended to conclude that if minds depend on movement, then minds must\nhave something corporeal in them. How could it be that our thoughts,\nwhich have something corporeal in them, namely, movement, are not\nthemselves corporeal? And yet, this is exactly what Desgabets argued.\nHe believed that thoughts have something corporeal in their being\nwithout themselves being corporeal—in the same way that every\nobject in our thought has a beginning, continuation, and end without\nthese objects having duration in themselves. While things really have\nduration, it is only extrinsically and by thought, “the same\nway a pole is divided into ten feet when one imagines the ten feet”\n(OPD 7: 299). \n\nAt first glance, Desgabets’s analogy between attributing a\ncorporeal nature to thoughts and attributing a duration or division to\nthings serves more to confuse than clarify. But if we draw on his\nearlier point about the true nature of individual bodies, we can make\nsome sense of it. Recall that individual bodies are real in that they\nresult from the division of matter by motion into assemblages of local\ndispositions of parts of matter. Bodies then act upon our sensory\norgans which in turn are received as ideas in the mind. But the\nindividuation of perception into sensible ideas of\nbodies is essentially an operation performed by the mind, even though\nit has its foundation in the local dispositions of matter itself. For\nexample, our perception of a ten foot pole is the effect of a specific\nassemblage of local dispositions of matter acting upon our sensory\norgans at a certain time and the mind’s division of\nthat sensible body into ten feet. The local disposition itself is not\nintrinsically a pole, or ten feet long, but it is so extrinsically,\nthat is, by thought. Similarly, thoughts themselves are not\nintrinsically extended or subject to movement, but they are so\nextrinsically, that is, as an effect of the operations of the sensory\norgans of the body. In other words, just as the local movements of\nmatter individuate thought extrinsically giving the mind individual\nthoughts, the thought of immaterial substance individuates matter\nextrinsically thereby giving it perceptions of individual bodies. The\nmind-body union, and the essential intentionality which results from\nit, create the mutual dependence of the operations of mind and matter\nwithout requiring that mind be material or matter be immaterial. \n\nThis is at the heart of Desgabets’s “fundamental\ntruth,” that for the proper use of reason we must recognize that\nall our ideas or simple conceptions have a real object outside of it,\nwhich is in itself what is represented by thought, and which actually\ncontains the degree of being that one sees there. If individual bodies\nand sensible objects are modal beings in the sense claimed by\nDesgabets then there is no cleavage between object and object known\nbecause they are one and the same thing. What is represented to our\nthought is the real object of knowledge, namely, material and\nspiritual substance, but what we sense are these substances as they\nexist in time, or in other words, as they exist at a given time by\nthought in virtue of the particular local dispositions of\nmatter.   According to Desgabets, Descartes’s fine doctrine concerning\nthe creation of the eternal truths, is the foundation of the true\n(Cartesian) philosophy. He claimed that had Descartes attended\nconsistently to this doctrine, he would have avoided all error. Due to\nits importance and opaqueness in Desgabets’s writings, the\n“Creation Doctrine” has generated a great deal of examination and\ndebate, most recently stimulated by Beaude’s and\nRodis-Lewis’s publication of Desgabets’s philosophical\nwritings (Desgabets, 1981). Rodis Lewis (1981) and Lennon (1998) set\nthe stage for the dialectic of the debates in the period. Schmaltz\n(2002), Cook (2005), Faye (2005), and Easton (2009) variously argue\nfor the importance of the doctrine in Desgabets’s development of\nthe Cartesian philosophy, and its philosophical significance. Gatto\n(2017) presents a nice synthesis of the literature, and sorts out the\ncomplicated reception and role of Descartes’s doctrine,\nparticularly for Desgabets. Despite the controversies surrounding the\ninterpretation and significance of this doctrine, there are some\npoints of agreement. As Desgabets understood it, it requires that God\nbe equally the author of all created things, in their being and their\nessence. It requires that there be no essence without existence, which\nis to say, that there can be no purely possible beings either in the\nhuman mind as Descartes allowed, or in God’s mind, as\nMalebranche argued. The notion that such truths are in some way prior\nto God’s creation of the world, existing as purely possible\nessences separate from actual existence, involves a separation of\nessence from existence, and supposes that essence is something\nactually separable and conceivable without existence.   Truth, which exists only by the relation of conformity of thought\nto its object, is contingent in that it depends on God’s will in\nhis free creation of the universe. Truth is eternal in its\nindependence from time or temporal variations, and it is immutable in\nthat once God wills the world, things never change in respect to their\nsubstance but only in respect to their modes of being. Although we\nmust wait to know what things God actually created, we are guaranteed\nof the truth of our ideas since it is the object itself that\ndetermines what we perceive.  Truth is necessary in that God gives all\nobjects He creates an irrevocable being, but it is contingent in\nrelation to His absolute and unlimited power. God is the equal author\nof the essence and the existence of things He created, He\n“… gave them their essence and their existence which are\nequally contingent, and which once received, are nevertheless\npossessed by them irrevocably” (OPD 6: 249). Desgabets’s\nvoluntarism, then, is a qualified one, for though the eternal truths\ndepend upon God for their existence as their primary cause, they are\nno less indefectible, that is, they are unchangeable in their\nsubstantial being. \nThe tenets that Desgabets drew from the Creation Doctrine show us\nwhere Desgabets parts ways with Descartes on many points. For example,\nDescartes erroneously concludes in Meditation V that essences, such as\nthe true and immutable nature of a triangle, can exist separately from\nmaterial existence as a purely possible being. According to\nDesgabets’s strict adherence to the Creation Doctrine,\n“… objects precede truth in the order of nature,”\nsuch that, “… it is impossible that there be a triangle\nseparate from its existence, or that the whole be greater than its\npart if there is no whole or parts, which is to say in a word, that\nour principle is found yet more true, and it is impossible to think of\nnothing” (OPD 6: 232). The Creation Doctrine also grounds\nDesgabets’s treatment of the senses as the foundation of all\nknowledge, and his view that the substances are indefectible. Although\nat times elusive, the unity of Desgabets’s thought can be seen\nin his defense of the Creation Doctrine.  To conclude, when we view Desgabets’s work as a whole, there\nis no doubt that what he viewed as a revision or perfection of the\nCartesian philosophy others have argued are a fundamental\ndeparture. In his favor, he never strayed from the Cartesian\nmetaphysics of substance dualism, substance-mode ontology, mind-body\nunion and interaction, and the view that extension is the essence of\nmatter and thought the essence of mind. He remained loyal to the\nCartesian physics against the atomists. Moreover, and perhaps\nheretically to some, he strongly rejected the rationalist epistemology\nwhich often dominates in Descartes, and argued that Descartes’s\nown principles favor a sensory foundation for knowledge.","contact.mail":"patricia.easton@cgu.edu","contact.domain":"cgu.edu"}]
