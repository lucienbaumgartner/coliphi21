This much is\nuncontroversial. But it is natural to wonder about the extent of\nthe contributions of the two broad factors and about the nature of the\ninteractions. This is where the innateness controversy\nbegins. In the history of philosophy, the focus of the innateness\ndebate has been on our intellectual lives: does our inherent nature\ninclude any ideas, concepts, categories, knowledge, principles, etc, or\ndo we start out with blank cognitive slates (tabula rasa) and get all\nour information and knowledge from perception. Nativists defend\nsome variant of the first option, while Empiricists lean towards the\nsecond.\n\n\n\nTo modern ears this sounds like a straightforward empirical question\nthat can only be addressed scientifically. But even if we grant\nthat the philosophical controversy was to some extent\npremature – like Greek speculations about the ultimate constituents\nof the world – it is important to understand that the question\nloomed large in philosophy not only because of its inherent interest,\nbut primarily because of what followed – or was thought to\nfollow – from the competing positions. The innateness\nquestion was taken as a lynchpin in settling questions in morality,\nreligion, epistemology, metaphysics, and so on.\n\n\n\nA survey of the philosophical career of innateness reveals that\nalthough it is an easy doctrine to attack, it is a hard one to\nkill. Innateness has been in the philosophical limelight in two\nperiods – each time flaring, and then receding. In the ancient\nworld, it played a pivotal role in Plato’s philosophy, but was\nexcluded from the Aristotelian system that came to dominate subsequent\nphilosophical thinking. In the 17th and 18th century, it was\nrevived. It played an important role in Descartes’ theory of\nknowledge, Locke mounted a sustained assault against it at the very\nbeginning of his Essay, and Leibniz produced a detailed rebuttal\nagainst Locke. But the Lockean Empiricist approach carried the day,\nand innateness was written off as a backward and discredited\nview. Nineteenth century Kantianism, although potentially friendlier\nto innateness, left it on the sidelines as philosophically\nirrelevant. Recently, however, prompted by Noam Chomsky’s claims\nthat findings in linguistics vindicate Nativism against Empiricism\n(see Chomsky 1965 for an early example), innateness has made a strong\ncomeback; it is once again the subject of philosophical and scientific\ncontroversy.\n\n\n\nEven before the competing positions on innateness were delineated,\nreflective thinkers were drawn to one or the other pole of the\ncontroversy. We can already see a precursor of the debate in the\nopposing theories of knowledge of the pre-Socratic philosophers\nEmpedocles and Anaxagoras. \n\nThe poetic Empedocles, who speculated that reality is the product of\never-recurring cycles of Love and Strife, held that sensation,\nperception, and even wisdom, is a matter of knowing “like by\n like”.[1]\nHis rival\nAnaxagoras held that “perception is by\n opposites”.[2]\n One way to read these obscure fragments is to see them as emblematic\nof two different ways of thinking about the mind. For Empedocles, the\nmind is made for the world. Mind grasps reality because it is\npre-tuned to the world and resonates with it. For Anaxagoras, the\nworld has to impress itself upon us; to shape our unformed minds into\nits form. This image of the world ‘informing’ the\nknower becomes the tabula rasa of 17th century\nEmpiricism. But there is another connection. Empedocles, with his\ncycles of Love and Strife, is unabashedly speculative.  Anaxagoras, on\nthe other hand, comes down to us as “dry, clear-headed,\n…[having a] common sense attitude”. This difference in\nintellectual personality is reflected in the subsequent debate.\nEmpedocles would be very much at home with the Nativistic Rationalist\nphilosophers and their “rather dreamlike vision of the\nuniverse”, as Bernard Williams has put it. The British\nEmpiricists are more likely to share Anaxagoras’ commonsensical\nimpatience with such flights of fancy. \n\nOne last parallel worth noting while we have these early figures in\nview is the very radical nature of Empedocles’ Nativism. The\nfragment can be read as saying that all our modes of\nunderstanding are somehow mirrored in our makeup. Despite their\nvery different philosophical commitments and interests, ancient,\nmodern, and contemporary Nativists are all drawn to this\ntotalistic version of the doctrine. It is not so much\nthat they all defend this radical position, but they are all at least\nattracted to it. The prevailing thought is that something about\nthe nature of concepts (ideas, knowledge etc.) per se pushes us to the\nNativist position. \n\nAs with most philosophical matters, Plato is the first in the\nWestern tradition to address the innateness question directly and to\nwork out some of its broader implications. The issue first comes\nup in the Meno, where he puts forth the doctrine of anamnesis,\nwhich holds that all learning is recollection, that everything\nwe will ever learn is already in us before we are\n taught.[3]\nAccording to\nthis view, perception and inquiry remind us of what is innate\nin us. In the dialogue, Socrates supports this view by showing\nthat by simply asking an uneducated slave the right questions, the\nslave can ‘discover for himself’ a version of the\nPythagorean theorem. Socrates does not elaborate the\nanamnesis claim as much as we would like. Among other\nthings, it is not clear what counts as knowledge in this context, what\nexactly is innate, or how the innate interacts with perception and/or\ninquiry to give rise to knowledge. Still, Nativists have treated\nthe slave-episode in the Meno as a touchstone for their view\n(‘Platonism’ has at different times referred to the\ninnateness doctrine). Apart from the interpretive problems\njust noted, the Meno has never been treated as a significant defense of\nNativism, because it is too easy to doubt Socrates’ claim that\nthe slave has not been told the solution. Skeptics see\nSocrates’ ‘questioning’ as really implicitly feeding\nthe slave the right answers. The upshot is that the demonstration\nhas remained famous as a pedagogical tour de force, but not as\na compelling defense for the doctrine of recollection. \n\nIn the later dialogue Phaedo, Socrates argues that the notion of\nequality involved in perceiving a pair of sticks as equal could not\nhave its source in experience and therefore must be\n innate.[4]\nHere the\nfocus is not on knowledge per se, but on concept-application,\nand Plato introduces the theory of forms as part of his explanation: we\nhave an innate grasp of the form Equality, and this (grasp of the) form\nis somehow involved in our perceiving sticks as equal. Here again\nthe case is less than compelling for at least two reasons: first, it is\nhard to pin down exactly how the equality argument is supposed to go,\nand second, we are still not sure about the content of Plato’s\ntheory of forms. \n\nDespite the weaknesses in the arguments, Plato’s discussions\nbegin to put key Nativist pieces into play. One could argue,\nfollowing Whitehead’s famous remark, that all the key elements in\nsubsequent Nativist theorizing are anticipated in Plato.\nEspecially important is (i) the form of argument (now termed\nthe poverty of the stimulus argument): some x must be innate\nbecause of the inadequacy of sensory experience, and (ii) the\nfocus on mathematical knowledge and concepts. \n\nThough the innateness doctrine is, strictly speaking, an hypothesis\nabout cognitive development, it is attractive to Plato because of its\ndeeper metaphysical and methodological consequences. In the Meno,\ninnateness solves what is sometimes termed the paradox of\ninquiry. The paradox: inquiry into the nature of x only makes\nsense if we don’t know the nature of x, and we have a\nway to determine if a candidate account of x’s nature is\ncorrect. But if we don’t know the nature of x, how\nare we supposed to determine whether a solution is correct?\nPlato’s anamnesis solution sees inquiry as a kind of\ndeep memory recall. The right answer to our question is already\nwithin us. Inquiry, when successful, reminds us of that answer,\nin the same way that we are reminded of the name that goes with a\nface. Once the name is consciously brought to mind, we (somehow)\nknow we have it. In this way, innateness provides a\nrationale for Socrates’ philosophical practice. We once\ngrasped the transcendent Ideas that represent the real nature of\nthings. The trace of that earlier understanding remains in our\nsouls, waiting to be awakened by inquiry. So it makes sense to\nembark on a philosophical search for the nature of Truth, Justice,\nPiety, Courage, and so on. \n\nGiven innateness, Socrates ultimately arrives at a doctrine of\npre-existence – that there is a stage of our existence, before this\nlife, in which we came by our knowledge – and he goes on to use\npre-existence in an argument for the immortality of the soul.\nThis connection between innateness and immortality prompts\nSocrates’ deathbed discussion of innateness in the Phaedo, where\nthe topic of discussion is the immateriality and immortality of the\nsoul. Plato seems to be aware that the connection between\nNativism and immortality is tenuous, but the purported tie will haunt\n(or edify, depending on one’s perspective) Nativism as it evolves\nin the modern period. \n\nPlato is the ur-Nativist, so one might have expected Aristotle to be\nthe ur-Empiricist. They do disagree on innateness, but assigning\nAristotle a place in the innateness controversy is complicated.\nAristotelian thinking rejects Platonic Nativism, in large part because\nit rejects Plato’s poverty of the stimulus argument.\nThe key here is the Aristotelian rejection of the theory of\ntranscendent forms. For Aristotelians, the form of a thing is\nnot a transcendent reality that the thing strives for and\nfails to reach, but is rather part and parcel of the thing\nitself. Material things are forms embodied in matter. For\nAristotle, our grasp of the nature or form of things is based in\nperception, which he understands as a process in which the form of\nthings – the sensible as well as the intelligible form – is\nconveyed to the mind (and the matter left\n behind).[5]\nSo there is no poverty of\nthe stimulus to motivate the Nativist account. Variations on this\nanti-Nativist approach dominated European thought for two millennia,\nand Aristotle’s more down-to-earth and less-speculative approach\nto philosophy is reflected in 17th and 18th\ncentury Empiricism. But it would obscure too many\ndifferences – especially in their views of perception and\nreason – to put Aristotle at the head of the Empiricist line. \n\nIntelligibility is at the heart of the revival of the innateness\ndoctrine in the modern period. From the very start of the Western\ntradition, it has been widely accepted that we not only sense the\nworld, but that we also make sense of it; that it is not only\nsensible but also intelligible. Platonism\nexplains intelligibility in terms of the innate forms that we are\nreminded of by sense-experience. Aristotelianism explains\nintelligibility in terms of a richer theory of perception – viz.,\nit holds that we receive the intelligible nature of things\nfrom the things themselves. The scientific revolution of the\n17th century, with its stress on the distinction between\nprimary and secondary qualities and its materialist conception of the\nphysical world, undercut the Aristotelian view of perception\ncompletely. The problem can be illustrated with the new account\nof vision. What happens when we see, according to the new\nscientific picture, is that light bouncing off an object carries a\npattern of motion to the eye. These motions cause motions in the\nbrain, and (somehow) conscious visual experience results. How can\nwe explain the richness of our conception of the world given that only\nmotions reach the sense organs? There seems to be no natural way\nto incorporate the transmission of Aristotelian intelligible forms into\nthis account, so the problem of intelligibility returns. In the\nSecond Meditation, Descartes exposes this gap between what the senses\nreceive and what the mind knows and understands. Considering a\npiece of wax, which presents itself to us as a contingent set of actual\nand possible sensory images, he asks how we come to understand it in\nthe way scientists must – as an inherently colorless, odorless,\npersistent object with an underlying nature that is subject to\nmathematical laws? The answer, for Descartes, is that we all have\nan abstract, non-sensory idea of a physical object.\nSense-perception makes it possible for us to ‘fill out’\nthis abstract idea with the contingent details of our actual\nsituation. But intelligibility, our most general\nunderstanding of the world – of physical objects, of\nspace, of causality, of God, and so on – is grounded in these\nabstract ideas. But where do these general abstract ideas come\nfrom, given the ‘poverty’ of sense? Nativism now\nseems an attractive answer. We must come into the world\npre-loaded with the categories (concepts, principles, general ideas,\netc) that will enable us to make sense of what we actually see, hear,\netc. Reason can mine this innate endowment to arrive at an\napriori understanding of things. \n\nOne can see the concept of innateness at work behind the scenes in\nDescartes’ wax argument, but that passage is designed more to\nrid us of the idea that our deepest understanding of things comes from\nthe senses than to defend innateness. It is in working out the\nimplications of the wax discussion that we arrive at an innate\nabstract concept of spatial extension. Innateness is also at work, but\nagain behind the scenes, in the central argument of the Meditations\nthat takes us from the fact that we have an idea of God to the\nexistence of God outside the mind. This (innate) idea of an infinite\nbeing (God’s ‘signature’ in us his creatures, as\nDescartes has it) is what makes it possible for us to know that there\nis a world beyond our thoughts and that our thoughts are not\nsystematically mistaken. But in the discussion in Meditation III,\nDescartes again does not feature the concept of innateness – when\nand how we’ve come by our idea of God is less to the point than\nthat we have it and could not have constructed it from our thoughts\nabout our own mind. What’s more, that argument takes as a given\na causal principle to the effect that the cause of an idea must have\nat least as great a ‘degree of formal reality’ (read: reality)\nas the ‘objective reality’ (read: the degree of reality of the\nobject/content) of the idea.  The principle is arcane, and it’s hard\nto imagine how Descartes could have explained its availability to the\nMeditator except by claiming that it rests on a clear and distinct\ninsight into the nature of causality, which would presumably have to\nbe given innately.  In both these arguments, as in most of his main\nworks, Descartes does not address the concept of innateness head-on\n(the outburst in his Notes Directed Against a Certain Program, which\nincludes a defense of the radical view that\nall our ideas are innate, is the most notable\nexception). Part of the problem might be that it is not easy to\nintegrate the claim that there are innate ideas or principles with\nDescartes’ identification of mind and consciousness. What\nis innate is in the mind prior to experience. He suggests at one\npoint that ideas may be in the mind innately in the way that gout may\nrun in a family. To the extent that this is read as a propensity\ntheory, it will come in for heavy criticism in the Empiricist attack on\ninnateness. \n\nLeibniz, the other important Rationalist defender of innateness,\nelaborates the theory in a number of important ways in his New Essays\non Human Understanding. He famously challenges Locke’s\nanalogy of the mind as blank slate with a competing image of the mind\nas a block of marble whose veins already mark out the shape of Hercules\n(52). A more significant point is his sharpening of the poverty\nof the stimulus claim. He argues that our experience of the world\nis always of contingent particulars, but our knowledge can be general,\nand sometimes necessary (50). Going back to the Meno example, the\nslave can see that the squares Socrates has scratched out in the dirt\nstand in a certain relation, but he ends up knowing that such a\nconnection must hold of any possible set of squares that meets\nSocrates’ initial description; that it holds – to use a phrase\nLeibniz introduced – in all possible worlds. Leibniz\nargues that rationality must involve more than induction from\ncontingent experience. It must ultimately rely on innate ideas\nand principles that allow us to grasp not just how things\nhappen to be, but also why they must be that\nway. \n\nLeibniz also addresses the question of how the innateness doctrine\nneeds to be integrated into a broader epistemology and theory of\nmind. Among his most important contributions in this area: (i)\nthe defense of unconscious mental states (53), (ii) the suggestion that\nnot all of our innate endowment needs to be realized as (unconscious)\nideas and thoughts, but might instead be\n‘procedural’ – inborn ways of thinking and reasoning\n(84), (iii) a clear distinction between something’s being innate\nin us and its being known innately, and (iv) the provocative\nidea, also hinted at in Descartes, that our innate endowment is not\nsimply a grab-bag of elements that God thought it would be good for us\nto start out with, but is in some way a systematic reflection of our\nnature – for example, the fact that we are substances and can\nreflect on our natures somehow provides us with the innate idea of\nsubstance (as Leibniz has it: we are “innate to\nourselves” (51–2)). Leibniz, like Plato, saw the innateness\nissue as being the most important point of disagreement\nbetween himself and Locke, and perhaps as the central issue in\nphilosophy. He suspected that Locke’s anti-Nativism was an\nindirect attack on the immaterial soul and therefore a challenge to the\nidea of the afterlife and immortality, and therefore a challenge to\nreligion, to ethics, and to public order. \n\nFinally, we note that there are really two distinct but related\nLeibnizian philosophies. The foregoing represents Leibniz’s\nattempt to ‘mainstream’ his thought and contribute to the\nbroader 17th century controversy over science, epistemology,\nand innateness. But there is another Leibniz that we find in his\nmore speculative, more Empedoclean, metaphysical writings, particularly\nthe Monadology. Leibniz’ goal there is presciently like the\nwork of contemporary string theorists – i.e., to look\nbehind the scientific picture and lay out the still-deeper\nontological and metaphysical nature of reality. The relevant\npoint for us is that the ultimate simple elements in this\nsystem – the individual ‘monads’ – contain\nrepresentations of the world beyond themselves, but these\nrepresentations are not caused by the world. For Leibniz,\nworld-to-mind causality is only an appearance. The reality is\nthat each monad contains, as part of its essential nature, a preloaded\nset of representations of the world. The sequential\n‘unfolding’ or ‘playing out’ of these\nrepresentations can be thought of, in the case of minds, as a stream of\nconsciousness. But the monads do not interact; instead, the\nstreams are coordinated by a pre-established divine harmony\n(Leibniz’s analogy is a pair of synchronized clocks). The\nupshot of all this is that we arrive (again) at the radical conclusion\nthat all thought and experience is innate. There can be\nno external origin for a mental element in Leibniz’s\nmonadology, and the same can be said for the metaphysics of Spinoza,\nthe third of the great Rationalists. \n\nThe three Nativist thinkers we have so-far discussed also happen to\nbe Rationalists; that is, they all hold that Reason allows us to go\nbeyond experience and to arrive at a more profound grasp of the\nworld. There is a natural affinity between Nativism and\nRationalism, but it needs to be stressed that despite the tendency to\nidentify the two, they are different. Nativism is about the\ninitial conditions of our mental life. Rationalism is about the\ncharacter of what we can know. Nativism is a supporting element\nin these larger Rationalist philosophies. But this raises a\nquestion that perceptive critics of 17th century Rationalism\nasked – viz., even if it were granted that there are\ninnate concepts and principles, how can they support Rationalism unless\nwe know independently that they are correct? Otherwise, we have\nno warrant to hold that these innate materials reveal the ultimate\nnature of the world (let alone all possible worlds). It is\ntempting to think that the 17th century response would be to\nadd the premise that such innate ideas and principles are God-given,\nand God would not deceive us. But this reply is inadequate.\nFirst, it is hard to avoid the charge of circularity, but second, it is\nalso dogmatic about God’s plans. How do we know, as one\ncritic put it, that the (purported) innate materials we start with are\nnot meant to be burnt away by experience, in the manner of the natural\nwild growth of soil before it is cultivated? \n\nAs it happens, the Rationalist can resist the temptation to invoke\nGod, and avoid the dead-end to which it leads. For Descartes, the\npresence in us of innate materials is of course a contingent fact, but\nthe warrant for the deeper truths we derive from what is\ninnate does not involve any premises about their origin. It is\nbecause we have innate ideas that we can think of mind and extension in\nthe abstract way we do. But the principle that matter\n(extension) cannot think is an a priori truth (according to\nDescartes) because we see clearly and distinctly that it is\nholds. Clarity-and-distinctness as a criterion of truth raises\nits own difficulties, but the difficulties are not the obvious and\ndevastating ones raised above. Once we disentangle Nativism from\nRationalism, we can look back and identify the non-Nativist Rationalist\nelements in Aristotle, and see Rationalist elements in the Empiricist\nand arch anti-Nativist Locke. Both present us with forms of\nRationalism without Nativism. By the same light, contemporary\nnativists inspired by Chomsky’s Linguistic Nativism are\nemphatically \nanti-Rationalist.[6] \n\nThe modern debate about innateness really begins with\nLocke’s polemic against innate principles and innate ideas in the\nopening chapters of his Essay Concerning Human Understanding, which\nhappens to also be the founding document of modern Empiricism.\nThe point of the polemic is to delegitimize innateness as a candidate\nexplanation of our knowledge and understanding, and to thereby leave\nthe field to the Empiricist account that is developed in the rest of\nthe Essay. The thrust of Locke’s arguments is\ntwo-fold: first, that the facts Nativists cite in favor of their views\nare not facts at all; second, that even if the facts were granted for\nthe sake of argument, Empiricist accounts are preferable, because they\nare simpler. The simplicity resides in the fact that both parties\naccept a role for experience in knowledge acquisition.\nEmpiricists presume there is only experience; Nativists think\nthere is experience plus innate principles and ideas. If we can\naccount for knowledge without innate ideas, principles, and so on, the\nEmpiricist wins. Given the logic of the situation as Locke\nunderstands it, the whole polemical negative attack on\ninnateness is almost beside the point. The real epistemological\nprize he is after can only be won by providing a satisfactory\npositive innateness-free account of how knowledge is produced\nfrom experience. But Locke is probably right in thinking that his\nEmpiricist doctrines will be more convincing if there is no Nativist\nalternative to challenge them. \n\nWhy, according to Locke, is Nativism not only unnecessary but\nillegitimate? One prominent theme is that if there were innate\nprinciples in the mind – his example is Whatsoever is,\nis – we would be aware of them, and they would therefore be\nuniversally assented to. But, he argues, children and idiots cannot\neven make sense of such claims, let alone assent to them.  He goes on\nto argue that various fallback positions – assent when they\nunderstand, assent when they begin to reason, capacity to assent under\nappropriate conditions – all reduce the claim to a sort of\ntriviality. The upshot is that innateness is either a real alternative\nto Empiricism but obviously false, or trivially true but not\nincompatible with Empiricism. \n\nUnderlying much of Locke’s attack is the Cartesian view that\nto claim something is ‘in the mind’, innately or not, is to\ngive it a place in our conscious awareness. Leibniz’s bold\nhypothesis of non-conscious mental states would, if successful, sweep\naside most of Locke’s arguments against innateness. But we\nneed to keep in mind that the polemics in the Essay, though they were\nhistorically influential, are almost a sideshow. The real issue\nis whether the Empiricist can construct a satisfactory account of human\nknowledge without adverting to any innate ideas and principles.\nTo meet this challenge, Locke (and to an even greater extent Hume)\noffered what may be termed adequacy of the stimulus\ncounterarguments. Locke constructs a theory of experience\n(perception and reflection) as the source of all our ideas, sketches an\naccount of the mental faculties that can be brought to bear on these\nideas, and applies these materials to our ideas of infinity, number,\nspace, substance, our understanding of general principles of causality,\nand so on. These were the abstract ideas and principles that\nRationalists had claimed could not be derived from perceptual\nexperience. Locke wants to demonstrate that such ideas and\nprinciples can be acquired without the need for any innate\n‘pre-seeding’. Locke believes that the key to\nintelligibility and understanding lies in a proper appreciation of what\nour faculty of Reason can accomplish when set to work on the ideas\nreceived in our experience. \n\nIn considering Locke’s execution of this plan in the Essay we\ndiscover a trend that grows stronger in subsequent Empiricist thinkers\nlike Hume and his 19th and 20th century\nsuccessors. One can be easily misled into thinking that there was\na general agreement on both sides of this controversy about the\nexplanandum: we can call that our understanding, or simply the\nintelligibility of the world. The innateness controversy would\nthen be about which theory can provide the best explanation of this\nagreed-upon ‘Understanding’. But this positivistic\nparadigm of the dynamics of theory-selection does not fit the real\ndebate. A Kuhnian perspective is closer to the truth.\nEmpiricists inevitably reconfigured the explanandum – some\nelements of the original explanandum were to be (better)\nexplained by the Empiricist account, but a good deal of it was\nto be explained away as Rationalist over-reaching. Our\nearlier example of Descartes’ a priori claim that matter\ncannot think is a case in point. Locke’s system was\ncriticized for not being able to exclude the possibility of thinking\nmatter. But for Locke, that possibility was not excludable,\ndespite Descartes’ clear and distinct perception to the\ncontrary. So Locke does not accept the explanatory burden of\nproviding an Empiricist account of how it is that the Understanding\ngrasps the falsity of materialism and the truth of dualism. Our\nknowledge of the world does not extend as far as the Rationalist\nthinks, and the true explanatory burden is therefore lighter\nthan the Rationalist makes it out to be. This pattern of\nexplaining away reaches its culmination in Hume, who sees more\nclearly than Locke that the fact that the mind can make the world\nintelligible is itself a philosophical presumption that needs to be\nexplained away. Hume replaces it with a naturalistic account of\nhow we track the way the world appears to us, and collate the results\nto guide us in the future. Our understanding of the world, in\nHume’s philosophy, is thinned out into something the Rationalists\nwould not count as Understanding at all; his conception of human reason\nis, appropriately enough, a pale shadow of their Reason. \n\nThe doctrinally pure(r) Empiricism that we find in Hume also\ncontains a surprising twist for the innateness doctrine. The\nalternative to innateness, at least in Locke’s shorthand form, is\nthat ideas come via the senses from the world outside us. But it\ncan be argued that Hume’s Empiricism has no room for thinking of\na world outside us, and certainly not for ideas as copies of properties\nof things or as caused by things in that world (a point also stressed\nby the other prominent British Empiricist, Bishop Berkeley).\nHume, perhaps a bit tongue-in-cheek, tells us that the innateness\ndebate is totally wrong-headed and that as he sees it, all our\nimpressions are innate, in that they are original to the\n mind.[7]\nAlong these\nlines, one can argue that for Hume, innateness is a red herring.\nWhat matters to Empiricism is not the history of ideas in the mind and\nthe before or after, but the nature of those ideas.\nSpecifically, what’s foundationally important for Humean\nEmpiricism is not anti-Nativism, but what we might call\nexperientialism, the thesis that all our ideas are\nrepresentations of particular sensory states. We can\nsummarize this and say they must be ‘copies of\nexperiences’, but for Hume, it has no philosophical import if we\none day learn how to tinker with a fetus to produce in its mind an\n‘innate’ representation of the taste of chocolate.\nWhat counts is that the idea produced be experiential in the right\nsense. For Hume we will never be able to tinker away to produce\nan abstract idea of causal power, because there is no such\nidea – all ideas are experiential or constructs of such.\n(These points, I think, can explain why Hume is so cavalier about the\nfamous missing shade of blue that seems to not be copied from\nexperience – i.e., because it is still an experiential\n idea.)[8] \n\nKant is usually given short shrift in discussions of the history of\nthe Nativism-Empiricism controversy. He is certainly not an\nEmpiricist; he sees his philosophy as a response to the\nchallenge of Humean Empiricism. Nevertheless, he is critical of\nRationalist versions of the Innateness doctrine at every turn. In\nmy view, Kant is a\n Nativist.[9] \nThe reason for the anomalies is that he is\nmuch more than a Nativist, and assigns a very different role\nto what is innate in us than the role assigned by his Rationalist\npredecessors.  \n\nThe ‘more’ here is Kant’s distinctive approach\nto metaphysics and epistemology; his Transcendental Idealism. \nHume had argued that since knowledge is based on experience, our\nknowledge of the world could not go beyond registering and mining\nregularities in that experience. The prospect of what Kant called\nsynthetic a priori knowledge – of an understanding of the\nnecessary structuring principles of reality – was beyond us. \nKant takes it as a given that we have such knowledge and sets out to\nconstruct a system that explains how such knowledge is possible. \nHis response to Hume’s challenge is to argue that the\ndistinctive structure of experience is a function of our nature. \nWe impose regularities. If these regularities are\nrecognized as our contribution, and we understand the structuring\nprinciples that are at work, we can make sense of the actuality of\nsynthetic apriori knowledge. But the price we pay is that this is\nknowledge of the world of appearances, not about things as\nthey are in themselves. \n\nKant divides these ordering principles into the Forms of Sensible\nIntuition and the Categories. Space and Time\nare pre-experiential ordering principles that give us sense experience\nof a spatial and temporal world. The Categories play a parallel\nrole for the understanding. Through the category of\nCausality, for example, we impose causal structure on the\nevents that we perceive. This imposed structure allows us to move\nfrom the subjectivity of successive sensations to experience of an\nobjective world. Consider an analogy: the pixel structure of\nevery picture that a digital camera takes is the result of an ordering\nprinciple imposed on every photograph by the nature of the\ncamera. The pixel structure of the representations does\nnot capture a feature of the camera-independent reality. \nSimilarly, the spatiotemporality and categorical structure of our\nexperience is not a feature of a mind-independent\nreality.  \n\nKant’s main complaint against Rationalist Nativism was that\nit accepted that the innate had to correspond to an independent\nreality, but it could not explain how we could establish such a\ncorrespondence or use it to account for the full range of our\nknowledge. In this, it failed to meet\nHume’s\n challenge.[10] \nKant finds the\nposition guilty of a number of related fatal errors.  \n\nThe root problem of Rationalist Nativism, as seen through the lens\nof Kant’s Transcendental Idealism, is that it needs to say more\nthan that something – a framework of concepts, ideas, principles,\netc. – is innate in us. It needs to say that it is\nonly in us. It must acknowledge that we\ncreate the structure that we find in our experience. The\nproblems of Rationalist Nativism all arise from trying to get from the\nmind’s structuring to the world’s inherent\nstructure. Once we drop the idea that we are aiming for the\nworld’s inherent, mind-independent structure, the problems\n(should) dissolve.  \n\nFrom Plato until Kant, Nativism was supposed to serve Realism. \nWhatever the vision of reality was – Forms for Plato, matter and\nmind for Descartes, etc. – our grasp of that reality was possible\nbecause we were provided with a map to that reality before we set\nout. Kant rejects the Realist aspirations of this\ntradition. For him, we can never understand the\nultimate nature of things as they are in themselves. Our\ntheoretical knowledge can only go as deep as the structure we\nimpose. The only necessity we can grasp is the one we have\nspontaneously made. \n\nWe’ve discussed Kant’s main complaint about the\nNativist tradition, at least as a reply to the Empiricist\nchallenge. But he also argues that we have no innate\nrepresentations of Space, of Time, of Causality, or of any of\nthe ordering principles we impose apriori (Zoeller 1989). To\nreturn to our earlier analogy: the initial state of the camera includes\nno pictures/representations of the innate abstract pixel structure that\nthe camera imposes. But unlike the camera, we can\nacquire representations of these ordering\nconstraints – these Kant terms ‘pure apriori ideas’ of\nSpace, of Time, of Causality, of Substance, and so on. These pure\napriori ideas play a crucial role in our understanding of how\nknowledge of mathematics and metaphysics and natural science is\npossible. In this respect Kant agrees with Locke that there are no\ninnate principles or ideas to be ‘found’ in us. Both hold\nthat all our ideas have their origin in experience. But Locke thinks\nthat we build these ideas by abstracting from experience and\nrecombining abstracted elements. Kant holds that such representations\nor ideas cannot be abstracted from experience; they must be\nthe product of careful reflection on the nature of\nexperience.[13] \n\nThe camera analogy can help highlight an important shift.\n Imagine that our camera is damaged and its resolution in part of\nthe screen is diminished. This newly acquired constraint will be\nreflected in every subsequent photo, and this low-resolution element\nwould be an ‘apriori’ feature of each photo: it would be a\ncontribution of the representational structure of the camera, not of\nthe scene. The point is that the key feature of Kant’s\nframework elements is the role they play in structuring experience,\nnot whether they are present as part of the initial\ncondition. In principle, acquired changes could play\nthis\n role.[14] \nIn this respect,\nKant shifted the epistemological focus away from genetic questions of\norigins to questions about sources of warrant. \nIt could be argued that this shift moved innateness to the periphery of\nphilosophical concern until its 20th century\nrevival. \n\nIn terms of the historical contest, Empiricism emerged triumphant,\nand as inevitably happens in such victories, anti-Nativism triumphed\nover Nativism. The doctrine of innate ideas came to\nbe seen as backward and unscientific, as inextricably tied to\ndiscredited metaphysical and theological doctrines, and as therefore\nincompatible with a naturalistic approach to human nature.\nEmpiricism developed very much along Humean lines (and with\nAnaxagoras’ anti-speculative hard-headedness). The\n20th century Logical Positivists and Logical Empiricists\nagreed with Hume that we have no a priori knowledge about the\nintelligible structure of the\n world.[15]A priori knowledge is only\npossible in the formal sciences, and this is so only because such\nknowledge is ultimately about the structure of our concepts and/or our\nlanguage. Others, following Quine, have gone a step further and\nfollowed John Stuart Mill’s lead in rejecting all claims to\nknowledge of apriori necessary truths. For Quine, only\nour sensory evidence ultimately warrants the claim that\n 2+2=4.[16]\nOn both\nviews, once we get straight about the true nature and extent of our\nknowledge, Nativism turns out to be an unnecessary extravagance. \n\nEven without its 17th century metaphysical and theological\n‘baggage’, the Nativist view, and the entire controversy\nsurrounding it, came to be seen as born in conceptual confusion about\nthe proper task of a theory of knowledge. Real philosophical questions\nare about the\nnature of our ideas and about the structure and\njustification of our knowledge. Nativism deflects attention\nfrom these issues, and distracts us with empirical claims about\nthe genesis of ideas and beliefs.  Kantianism, the main\n19th century alternative to the Empiricist project, presses\nmany of these ideas. The modern scientific temperament was influenced\nby both these approaches, and eventually to be identified with\nEmpiricism. We learn about the world only from our perceptual\nencounter with it; nothing is revealed to us beforehand. So innateness\nwas triply condemned: it was born of superstitious religious thinking,\nit is empirically false, and it is philosophically beside the\npoint. \n\nAlthough the battleground for the historical controversy over\ninnateness was epistemology, if we take one step back we see the\nRationalist defense of the doctrine as part of a broader set of\nmetaphysical, theological, and ethical commitments. Different\nNativists would highlight different elements, but the underlying\npicture of human nature that emerges from the Nativist side of the\nhistorical debate is something like this. We human beings,\ndistinct from all other created things, are not fully of this material\nworld. We are guided in our thought and action by a special gift\nfrom our creator, who has seen fit to implant in our souls the deeper\ntruth of the nature of the world, and special guidance about how we are\nto act in it. We must discover this inner truth, and adhere to it\nin the face of the often-distracting course of our experience. \n\nLooking at Locke as the voice for the other side of the controversy,\nwe find a very different set of motivations. Nativism makes\nunderstanding seem too much like inherited wealth. It suggests\nthat without our innate legacy we would not have the resources to\nunderstand the world we live in. To this extent, Nativism stands\nagainst the ethos of individual initiative. It can also be too\neasily abused as a tool of intellectual authoritarianism, because those\nwho are not up to the task of uncovering these rarified innate truths\nmust take their lead from those who are. For the Empiricist this\nis an invitation to superstition, obscurity, and abuse. The\nEmpiricist does not see our understanding as in any way given to us as\na gift. It is the product of our individual labor. God has\ngiven all of us the general ability to reason, and this includes the\nability to acquire knowledge from experience; it is our job to exercise\nthat ability. We fully own our knowledge: we collect the raw\nmaterials and add our mental labor to create it. Locke is more\ndrawn to the dignity of the worker than to the status of the aristocrat\nwho has received a special inherited honor. \n\nThe factors that drove Locke’s rejection of Nativism\nultimately led, in no small part through Hume’s philosophy, to\nthe now-dominant naturalistic picture of human beings. On this\npicture we humans are material beings continuous with the rest of the\nnatural world, we have no divine element in our nature and no divine\nguidance to help us along, and no recourse but to build our\nunderstanding of our world on our experience. But I close with\ntwo points about these developments. The first has to do with\nLocke, our arch anti-Nativist, and it is that he would have been\nhorrified at what his Empiricism has wrought. The underlying\nRationalist picture I sketched two paragraphs back is a picture that\nLocke would, with some small reservations, have accepted. He was\na dualist and a theist, he believed in an afterlife, and he saw our\ngod-given faculty of Reason as capable of discovering the most\nimportant truths about our world and our lives – i.e., the\nexistence of God and the nature of our moral duties. The second\npoint is that even though our contemporary naturalism was inspired by\nanti-Nativist Empiricism, it has seen a revival of Nativist\nthinking. The turning point in this revival, Chomsky’s work\nin linguistics, is an area set apart from the concerns that energized\nthe historical controversy over\n innateness.[17]\nBut contemporary\nresearch in cognitive development, genetics, evolutionary psychology,\nand other fields has extended Chomsky’s Nativist thinking to the\nvery concepts and principles that were at the heart of the historical\ndebate (god, morality, personhood/mind, causality, mathematics, basic\nontology, etc.).","contact.mail":"samet@brandeis.edu","contact.domain":"brandeis.edu"}]
