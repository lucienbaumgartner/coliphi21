Of Scholem Martin Buber once remarked,\n“all of us have students, schools, but only Gershom Scholem has\ncreated a whole academic discipline!” His contribution lay in\nfive distinct yet connected areas which will be detailed below: the\nresearch and analysis of kabbalistic literature spanning from late\nantiquity to the twentieth century; the phenomenology of mystical\nreligion; Jewish historiography; Zionism, and the spiritual and\npolitical condition of contemporary Judaism and Jewish civilization. He\npublished over 40 volumes and close to 700 articles almost all of which\nare listed in the Scholem Bibliography published in 1977. He trained at\nleast three generations of scholars of Kabbala many of whom still teach\nin Israel and the Diaspora. Scholem was also part of a select group of\nGerman-Jewish intellectuals from the Weimar period who rejected their\nparents' assimilationist liberal lives in favor of Zionism. He\nimmigrated to Palestine in 1923 and quickly became a central figure in\nthe German-Jewish immigrant community that dominated the intellectual\nlandscape in Mandate Palestine from the 1920's until the Second\nWorld War.\n\n\n\nGershom Scholem was born Gerhard Scholem in Berlin in 1897. The\nScholem family had lived in Berlin since the early part of the\nnineteenth century. Gerhard's father Arthur was an assimilated\nJew and German nationalist, quite common among middle-class Berlin Jews\nat that time. Arthur Scholem had a successful business as a printer and\nit was there Scholem first became exposed to books at a very young age.\nThere is a story that in 1911, when Scholem had already rejected his\nfather's politics and openly espoused Zionism, his mother bought\nhim a portrait of Theodore Herzl as a Christmas present. Another\nversion has it that the portrait was hung on the Christmas tree in the\nScholem home. There were four boys in the Scholem family three of whom\nrebelled against their father's politics and Jewish identity in\ndifferent ways. The eldest son Reinhold joined the staunchly\nnationalist Deutsche Volkspartie, the third son Werner became a\ncommunist, and Gershom became a Zionist. Having no Jewish education\nprior to his Zionist turn in 1911 the adolescent Scholem began learning\nHebrew and studying Talmud in one of the Berlin community schools. By\n1915 he was immersing himself in any kabbalistic works he could find\neven though he admitted understanding very little. Although Zionism\nbrought Judaism to the center of the young Gershom's life it\nnever really inspired religious observance although Scholem tells us in\nthe biography of his early life From Berlin to Jerusalem that\nhe did experiment with some form of observance while still an\nadolescent in Germany. Throughout his life, however, Scholem remained a\ncommitted secularist, and secularism played an important role in his\nrendering of Jewish history and the study of Kabbala. \n\nThe rift between Scholem and his father grew as Gershom openly\ncriticized his father's German nationalism and bourgeois\nlifestyle. It reached a breaking point after a heated argument about\nhis brother Werner's impending court-martial for treason while\nserving in the German army. Arthur exploded and banished the young\nGershom from the family home, giving him 100 German Marks for his\njourney. This forced Gershom to find other living arrangements in\nBerlin. He had already become acquainted with the young Zionist Zalman\nRubashov who later became Zalman Shazar, the third president of Israel.\nRubashov, claiming Scholem's banishment made him a “refugee\nfor Zionism,” invited him to board at a rooming house on the west\nside of Berlin that housed numerous Eastern European Jewish immigrants\none of whom was Shai Agnon. Many of the Zionists he met there were\nolder and would subsequently have an important influence on his life\nespecially after he immigrated to Palestine in 1923. \n\nInspired by his radical Zionism and utter disdain for German\nnationalism Scholem expressed strong opposition to the Great War (and\nsubsequently nationalism more generally), a belief he held throughout\nhis life and affected his Zionism later on. Unable to avoid the draft\nafter two deferments, he entered the German army where he spent a mere\ntwo months before being discharged, labeled a “psychopath\ntemporarily unfit for duty.” Scholem then entered The University\nof Berlin with an interest in studying pure mathematics which he\npursued for a few semesters before deciding he did not have sufficient\ntalent to succeed. It was around that time, in 1917, that Scholem\ndecided to immigrate to Palestine and the rest of his education in\nGermany was geared toward that end. During those years (approximately\n1916–1917) he met Martin Buber and, more importantly, Walter Benjamin,\nwho would have a profound influence on Scholem's intellectual\ntrajectory. \n\nAs was common among college youth in Germany, Scholem attended numerous\nuniversities. He ended up in Munich where he turned his attention to\nhis dissertation. He produced a translation and annotated version of\none of the first kabbalistic books Sefer ha-Bahir (the Book of\nIllumination), successfully defending his dissertation in January 1922\nand graduating summa cum laude. After graduation Scholem put\nall his energy into his immigration and in mid-September 1923 set off\nfor Palestine without any concrete plans as to how he would support\nhimself. \n\nSoon after his arrival he was offered a position as librarian of the\n“Hebrew Section” of the newly founded National Library\nconnected with what would become the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. It\nwas in that position that Scholem began collecting and cataloging the\nhundreds of kabbalistic manuscripts that few had interest in and fewer\ncould read. His career began at that moment even though he was not\nappointed to a faculty position until some time later. Once he received\nhis faculty appointment, he remained at the Hebrew University until his\ndeath in 1982. \n\nScholem's early work consists of two main areas of research.\nFrom 1921 (while still in Germany) until around 1936 Scholem spent\nuntold hours collecting and analyzing every kabbalistic manuscript he\ncould locate. This required traveling to various libraries in Europe.\nOnce he arrived in Palestine he concentrated on the growing collection\nof Hebrew manuscripts located at the new National Library. This taxing,\narduous, and tedious work created a data base for Scholem that would\nserve his entire career. During this same period he undertook a series\nof highly critical reviews and essays on previous scholars who dealt\nwith Kabbala, most of which were published in the German-Jewish journal\nDer Jude and some in Hebrew Keriat Sefer a\njournal of Jewish Bibliography centered in Jerusalem. These early book\nreviews constitute an important — and often overlooked—part of\nScholem's career. It is here that he distinguishes himself from\nhis predecessors and develops the beginning of his historiographical\napproach that would only emerge in the next period of his research. His\ndissertation Das Buch Bahir was published in Leipzig in1923.\nHis first major publications after his dissertation were Kitvei Yad\nha-Kabbala, 1930; Perakim le-Toldot sifrut\nha-Kabbala,1931; and Bibliographia Kabbalistica, 1927,\nall bibliographical works examining his discoveries. In addition he\npublished more theoretical studies such as “Kabbalat R.\nYa'akov ve-R. Yizhak [ha-Cohen],” 1927; “Ha-Mekubal\nR. Avraham b. Eliezer ha-Levi” 1925, 26 and “Die Theologie\ndes Sabbatianismus im Lichte Abraham Cardosos” in 1928. Parts of\nthese studies would appear later in more expanded works dealing with\nvarious kabbalistic periods. In short, Scholem began his publishing\ncareer by first absorbing the entire scope of the history of Kabbala\nand then slowly putting it together from the earliest period until the\nlatest (Hasidism). \n\nIt is not without irony that Scholem's most celebrated works\nwere written in German or Hebrew yet his most popular and arguably most\ninfluential work Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism was written\nin English at a time when most scholarship in Judaica was still being\nwritten in German. By the end of the 1930's Scholem was already\nhard at work on Sabbateanism which would result in a major book (two\nvolumes in Hebrew, one large volume in English) entitled Sabbatei\nZevi: Mystical Messiah. A preliminary study on Sabbatean\nantinomianism “Redemption through Sin” was published in\n1936 and then appeared in English in 1970. During that time, in the\nlate 1930's, Scholem received an invitation from the Jewish\nInstitute of Religion in New York City to deliver a series of lectures\non Jewish Mysticism. He accepted the invitation and wrote the lectures\nin English (a first for him). These lectures were subsequently\npublished as Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism in 1941. This\nwork was a watershed for the entire field of Kabbala studies and Jewish\nStudies more generally. For the first time he offered a synoptic yet\ndetailed presentation of the entire history of Kabbala beginning with\nthe German Rhineland pietists (Hasidei Ashkenaz) from the\n12th century until Hasidism in the 18th and\n19th centuries. In this work Scholem presents his theory of\nthe authorship and construction of the Zohar, one of the first\nprogrammatic studies of the enigmatic kabbalist Abraham Abulafia, and\noffers the first glimpses of his own historiography. Moreover, the last\npage of Major Trends presents a few parenthetical observations\nabout the “possibility for Jewish mysticism today” that\nwould occupy a number of essays later in his career. His\nhistoriographical musings in Major Trends are important\nbecause it is here we are presented with Scholem's dialectical\napproach to history and his claim, for example, that Lurianic Kabbala\nwith its intense focus on creation as rupture and catastrophe was a\nresponse to the Jewish expulsion from Spain in 1492. This suggests that\nkabbalistic circles were using metaphysics to reify historical reality,\nwhich led Scholem to coin the term “historiosophy” to\ndescribe his understanding of history and metaphysics. It also offers\nanother first glimpse of his work on Sabbateanism which Scholem claimed\nwas a heretical but not necessary deviant form of Jewish mysticism. By\nthat I mean that even fairly early in his career Scholem held that\nKabbala is a theology that requires a normative law (tradition)\n— largely as a foil — but is always in dialectical\ntension with that law. The fact that antinomianism rose to the surface\nin the Sabbatean movement, breaking the normative tradition through its\ncombination of messianism and mysticism, should not be seen as an\naberration as much as a tragic inevitability. This Sabbatean heresy,\nargued Scholem, did not end with the failure of the movement but\ninfluenced, and even set the conditions for, Jewish modernity. His\nspeculations about possible influences between Sabbatean and Reform\nJudaism in Hungary were duly criticized by Jacob Katz for lack of\nhistorical evidence. However, the more theoretical and structural point\nabout Kabbala more generally and Sabbateanism in particular as being in\ntension with normative Jewish law (halakha) and the ways that\nSabbateanism may have (indirectly) informed early Reform which rejected\nhalakha outright is a topic worthy of further thought even though it\nmay be historically unprovable. While direct links between Sabbateans\nand Reformers have not been definitively unearthed, the geographical\nproximity of Sabbateans and early Reformers in Hungary and the extent\nto which Sabbateans functioned in clandestine ways is curious. \n\nOne of the great merits of Major Trends, and why it has\nbeen as influential as it has, is that all the “trends”\nincluded therein are set side by side to give one a sense that there is\na definite trajectory to mystical Judaisms even if that trajectory does\nnot follow a straight line. The descriptive part of the book begins (in\nChapter 2) with hekhalot mysticism and other pre-rabbinic and\nrabbinic mysticisms that appear in such apocryphal works as the Book of\nEnoch, including angelology and magic. It then moves on to the the\nRhineland German pietists, Abraham Abulafia and only then reaches the\ntextus classicus of medieval Kabbala, the Zohar. What are\nconspicuous in their absence are Sefer Yezeria (the Book of\nCreation) and Sefer ha-Bahir (the Book of Illumination). These\nomissions are intentional. This work is intended to discuss major\ntrends in Jewish mysticism and not major trends in\nKabbala. The distinction is an important one for Scholem. He\ndevotes another work called the Origins of the Kabbala (that\nappears in different versions in German, Hebrew, and English) where he\npresents a detailed analysis of the emergence of Kabbala beginning with\nthe Bahir and the Provencal circle, and maturing in Castile and Gerona\nin the two centuries immediately preceding the appearance of the Zohar\nin Guadalajara Spain at the end of the 13th century. The\nfirst chapter of Major Trends offers us one of Scholem's\nearliest lengthy statements on the phenomenology of mysticism that is\nexpanded later in his lectures at the Eranos conferences and published\nin the 1960's. It is here Scholem tries to define\n“mysticism” (he admits he is unsuccessful in doing so) and\nit is here he reveals some of the people he values as preceding him in\nthis endeavor (both Jewish and Christian scholars of Kabbala). This\nfirst chapter is an important part of Scholem's early move to\nexpand beyond the formal study of Kabbala into the area of philosophy\nof religion. \n\nScholem is convinced that Kabbala is a medieval phenomenon. That is,\nwhile there are important works of Jewish mysticism composed before the\nMiddle Ages, the metaphysics and cosmology we know as Kabbala emerges\nas a reaction against the rationalism of medieval Jewish philosophy\nthat posits a distant and unapproachable God in line with the\nAristotelian and Platonic (and Neoplatonic) schools. These kabbalists,\nwhile protesting such rationalism, were themselves very influenced by\ntwo dominant trends: Gnosticism and Neo-Platonism. In his\nOrigins, Scholem traces both Gnostic and Neoplatonic\ninfluences on these early kabbalistic thinkers, viewing them as deeply\nembedded in their medieval context. Kabbala in this period emerged in\nthree locales: Provence, Castile, and Gerona and included prominent\nrabbinic figures, most importantly Moses Nahmanides. Origins of the\nKabbala begins with an analysis of the Book Bahir (taken\nlargely from his doctoral thesis) a work Scholem claims emerges from a\ncircle of mystics led by the enigmatic Isaac the Blind in Provence\nalthough he suggests some strata of this enigmatic work may originate\nin some unknown Jewish Gnostic groups. For Scholem, the Bahir\nis the first book of Kabbala. When we move to Castile and Gerona,\nKabbala becomes more actively engaged in posing an alternative theology\nto rationalist philosophy. Scholem maintains that the Gerona school was\nnot an independent entity but more of an extension of the earlier\nProvencal circle that produced the Bahir. This polemic (between\nphilosophers and kabbalists and between Talmudists and kabbalists)\ncontinued until the end of the sixteenth century when Kabbala won the\nhearts and minds of many Jews after the Spanish expulsion in 1492 and\nthe forced conversions and expulsions in Portugal in 1496. Scholem\nargued this was in large part due to two factors: First, that\nphilosophy too easily justified bogus Jewish conversion, that is, the\nchoice to internalize Judaism and abandon outward ritual; and more\nimportantly, that philosophy could not offer solace for the historical\ncrisis of the expulsion. After the expulsion Kabbala moves from the\nperiphery to become the default theology of Judaism. It is in these\npolemical centuries, however, that Kabbala develops its most important\nfeatures that become the foundation of all subsequent Kabbala. One is\nits emanationist theory of creation and the descent of divine effluence\ninto the world. Another is its elaborate version of ta'amei\nha-mitzvot or reasons for the commandments (a discipline initiated\nin its medieval form by the most famous Jewish rationalist Moses\nMaimonides). Unlike many earlier pre-kabbalistic mysticisms, this\ninextricably connects mystical doctrine to Jewish law and ritual. A\nclassic example of this is Ezra of Gerona's Ta'amei\nha-Mitzvot printed erroneously in the name of Nahmanides. Another\nis the beginning of kabbalistic exegesis of Scripture. Bahya ben Asher\nof Saragossa's kabbalistic commentary is a classical example of\nthis phenomenon in the pre-zoharic period that is expanded and deepened\nlater in the Zohar and its commentaries. Yet another is the\nproliferation of mystical commentaries on prayer that first emerge in\nthe Provencal fraternities of Isaac the Blind. Finally in this period\nwe see the first systematic cosmologies that become templates for later\nkabbalistic doctrine. One example would be Azriel of Gerona's\nSefer Esser Sephirot. I will discuss the historiographic\nissues implicit in these two works in another section. Suffice it to\nsay that given the many publications of Scholem in this middle period\nof his career, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism and\nOrigins of the Kabbala stand out as the most important and\ninfluential.  \n\nFor Scholem Jewish messianism and Sabbateanism are intimately\nconnected. This is not because Sabbateanism is the only form of Jewish\nmessianism but because Sabbateanism represents, for him, the\nquintessence of the tension between tradition and its self-destruction\nthat lies at the root of all forms of Jewish messianism reaching back\nto the Hebrew Bible. This idea came to Scholem very early in his\ncareer, decades before he even began serious work on his magisterial\nSabbatai Zevi: Mystical Messiah. He was first made aware of\nSabbateanism by his friend Zalman Rubashov probably between 1916–1918,\nbut he didn't begin research on the movement until 1927 and\npublished his first article on the Marrano Sabbatean Abraham Miguel\nCardozo “Die Theologie des Sabbatianismus im Lichte Abraham\nCardosos” in 1928. This was followed by the more important\ntheoretical study “Redemption though Sin” published in\n1936. In this essay Scholem posits what would become his central claim\nabout messianism and tradition. First, that there are essentially two\nkinds of messianism; restorative and utopian-catastrophic. Both of\nthese are manifest in the singular movement of Sabbateanism. The\nrestorative model envisioned the messianic as a return to an older era\n(i.e., the Davidic kingdom) that was revolutionary but only within the\nconfines of the tradition. The utopian-catastrophic model (Scholem also\ncalls it apocalyptic) envisions a rupture of tradition and the\ninauguration of an entirely new era. While these models existed before\nSabbateanism, the restorative model in the Maimonidean messianism and\nthe utopian model in the messianic theology of the anonymous\n14th century Sefer Temunah and later apocalyptic\nmystics such as David Reuveni, only in Sabbateanism do they both emerge\nfully as “dark forces” that affect, and threaten, the\nentire Jewish nation. Moreover, once these forces are unleashed —\nespecially in a traditional world whose authority had already been\nweakened — they can never again be totally suppressed, even\nthough the formal Sabbatean movement loses much of its direct influence\nby the 18th century either through attrition or religious\nconservatism. That is, for Scholem, Sabbateanism is such an important\ntopic precisely because it re-directs Jewish history by exposing the\nunderside of Jewish mysticism, Judaism's\n“counter-history,” in a way that creates the conditions for\nJewish modernity, including Zionism. In this sense, Sabbateanism is the\nlynchpin to Scholem's entire intellectual project. \n\nThe Sabbatean heresy did not emerge in a vacuum. There are many\ntheories about why it became as popular as it did. Scholem's\ngeneral approach is that while Kabbala, like all intellectual\nconstructs, reacts to history, it is the esoteric trends that are often\nthe most potent forces needed to unleash innovation, which is often\ndeemed heretical (at least at the outset). Thus the roots of\nSabbateanism were not the impoverished or oppressed state of the Jews\n(although these factors may have played a role) but the dominance of\nLurianic Kabbala born in mid-16th century Safed. Scholem\nnotes that the messianic in Lurianism was not apocalyptic and may even\nhave been a conservative protest again utopian messianists like Reuveni\na generation earlier. Lurianism offered a gradual progressive\nmessianism of tikkun or the reparation of the broken cosmos\nbuilt on the foundations of its theory of creation as rupture and\nexile. Yet Lurianism also rose at a time (a generation after the\nSpanish expulsion) when Jews were in need of a new theology to justify\ntheir new reality. The fact that the Ottoman Sultan Bayazid II invited\nJews to re-settle Erez Israel after 1516 and the fact that Lurianic\nKabbala arose in Safed, one of the four holy cites according to\ntradition (the others are Jerusalem, Hebron, and Tiberias) gave added\nheft to its messianic teachings. In short, according to Scholem, with\nLurianic Kabbala, Kabbala emerged from its subterranean — and\nlargely conservative—existence (or at least without a\nformidable competitor) and set the stage for the antinomian\ncounter-traditional dimensions of Kabbala to erupt and gain popular\nattention. There are at least three factors that contributed to\nLurianism's success and subsequently the success of Sabbateanism:\n(1) the weakening of rabbinic authority in the sixteenth-century (even\nconsidering that the same locale and same decades gave us the\nShulkhan Arukh); (2) the lack of any viable ideological\ncompetitor with the demise of philosophy after the expulsion; and\n(3)Luria's comprehensive and compelling myth coupled with the\npositive historical development of the first systematic, albeit slow,\nre-settlement of Jews in Erez Israel since the early Middle Ages. \n\nWhat Lurianism did not offer was a charismatic messianic figure to\nfinalize its messianic vision. Here is where Sabbateanism found its\nrole. Scholem notes that Nathan of Gaza, Sabbatai Zevi's prophet\nand spokesperson, largely nullified the need for continued Lurianic\npractice once the “messiah” was revealed. Not unlike\nPaul's view of the law, for Nathan once the messiah arrived\none's faith must now be focused on his role in finalizing the\nprocess. In fact, culminating the process required the messiah to break\nthe law in order to redeem his people, thus opening the\n“counter-historical” notion of antinomianism that lay\ndormant in so much of mystical Jewish doctrine. \n\nAfter Sabbatai Zevi's decision, under duress, to convert to Islam\nand remain under the protection of the Sultan (where he died a decade\nlater) his disciples split into “moderate” and\n“radical” camps. The moderates held that they should remain\nJews, even observant ones, and keep their faith in Sabbatai Zevi as a\nsecret doctrine. The “radicals” held they must imitate\ntheir master and thus convert to Islam to continue the redemptive\nprocess. Included in this radical camp was Jacob Frank (1726–1791)\n(about whom Scholem had little to say) who, with most of his disciples,\nconverted to Catholicism in 1759. The radicals did not present much of\na problem for the Jews as they disappeared from the community. The\nmoderates, however, presented a grave problem and inspired a whole\nindustry of Sabbatean hunting that extended into the 19th\ncentury. The point in all this, according to Scholem, is that\nSabbateanism destroyed Jewish tradition from within a century before\nthe Enlightenment, and may have even brought the latter into\nexistence. \n\nIn the year 1933, on the suggestion of Rudolph Otto, the Dutch\nheiress Olga Froebe-Kapteyn initiated an annual conference on her\nestate near Ascona, Switzerland that became known as the Eranos\nConference. The goal of this gathering was to bring together scholars\nof different religious traditions to discuss themes related to religion\nand spirituality. Scholem attended many of these conferences, presented\nnumerous papers, and took part in the larger ecumenical discussions. In\nthe years Scholem attended, Carl Jung was a central figure and many of\nthe themes in the conferences reflected Jung's particular\ninterest in religious symbolism and mythology. Other important figures\nincluded Mircea Eliade, Henri Corbin, Karl Lowith, Gerhard van der\nLeeuw, Erich Neumann, and Paul Tillich. This conference proved to be an\nimportant outlet for Scholem to move beyond his more parochial studies\nin Israel and explore the areas of comparative religion and\nphenomenology that interested him in his youth. It also enabled him to\nreturn to a more cosmopolitan European and international setting and\npresent his more specific Hebraic research to a new audience. Scholem\npublished some of these essays in the conference's annual\nproceedings, the Eranos Yearbook, and some in German and\nEnglish journals. Other essays from Eranos appeared in a six-volume\ncollection entitled Judaica published in Germany between\n1963–1997. The best collection of some of these articles in English\nappears in On the Kabbalah and its Symbolism, 1965. In\nparticular “Religious Authority and Mysticism,”\n“Kabbalah and Myth,” and “Tradition and New Creation\nin the Ritual of the Kabbalists” represent Scholem's\nattempt to present his research to a non-specialist yet educated\naudience of scholars of religion and psychology. While some of his\nstudents claim that these essays do not make up an essential part of\nScholem's oeuvre, others claim that, in fact, these are some of\nthe richest and perhaps the most provocative dimensions of\nScholem's intellectual project. Combined with other essays such\nas “Tradition and Revelation as Religious Categories in\nJudaism” these essays address larger questions of philosophy and\nphenomenology of religion as they relate to Kabbala that are not dealt\nwith in his more technical Hebrew essays. When later scholars reflect\non the intellectual trajectory of Scholem's project, these essays\nprove indispensable. Moreover, the relationships he cultivated from\nattending these conferences expanded his own thinking and, by\nextension, his reconstruction of the history of Kabbala. \n\nEarly on Scholem became committed to critical historical scholarship\nas a mode of not only understanding the past but reconstructing the\npresent. That is, history and philology were, for him, the only basis\nfor any legitimate Jewish theology in a world that could no longer\nsupport authentic mysticism. While he did write theological essays, one\ncould argue that his historical/philological essays also had a\ntheological foundation. Scholem grew up in a world (Weimar Germany and\nthen Mandate Palestine) that was rife with intellectual activity all\nfocused on the reconstruction of Jewish life and culture around\nZionism. The Hebrew University (which began as an “Institute for\nJewish Studies” in 1924) where he taught, was expressly created\nfor that purpose. Scholem's historical work emerged as a critique\nof two distinct movements. \n\nThe first was the Wissenschaft des Judentums (the Science\nof Judaism), led by the 19th century Jewish historians\nLeopold Zunz, Moritz Steinschneider, and Henrich Graetz.\nThese historians reconstructed Jewish history for a newly\nemancipated western European Jewish community placing special emphasis\non normative rabbinic literature and culture (Talmud and Midrash) and\nthe medieval rationalist tradition as the backbone of Judaism. They\nignored or disparaged all forms of mysticism and Kabbala, claiming it\nto be an outdated and dark part of the Jewish past. Scholem's\nentire re-construction of Kabbala (and by extension of Judaism) would\nbe an unrelenting battle against them. As he wrote in a 1944 essay\n“Modern Jewish Studies” “In brief: the stones that\nwere rejected by the builders [the Science of Judaism] will become the\ncornerstone.” Scholem referred to their rejection of\nKabbala as the “origin sin” of the Science of Judaism from\nwhich everything else was merely an extension. This sentiment was\nreiterated in a 1962 essay “What Others Rejected: Kabbala and\nHistorical Criticism” delivered upon receiving one of the\nRothschild Prizes. While Scholem claimed laconically that the exilic\nand thus apologetic mentality that tainted the Science of\nJudaism's historical project was not, in fact, rectified with the\nnew national and sovereign consciousness he also acknowledged that\nnationalism (one form of Zionism) presented its own distorting lenses\neven as it corrected some mistakes of the past. \n\nSecond, in the early decades of the 20th century the philosophies of\nHermann Cohen and Martin Buber — the former a neo-Kantian\nrationalist, the latter a romantic existentialist—were immensely\npopular. Scholem rejected both grand schemes in favor of careful\nhistorical analysis of the regnant literary sources of Judaism. In\naddition, in response to Adolph von Harnack's influential The\nEssence of Christianity (Harnack argued, among other things, that\nChristianity was rooted in Gnosticism and thus needn't be\ndependent on any Jewish sources damaging the very idea of a German\nJewish culture) theologians such as Leo Baeck argued for an\n‘essence’ of Judaism to counter Harnack's position\nthat Judaism was irrelevant and illegitimate for Christianity.\nBuber and Scholem both rejected the notion of an essence of Judaism yet\nboth differed on the alternative. Buber focused on the notion of\nErlebnis, or intuitive experience, as the anchor of a\nhuman's relationship to God via revelation (or relation). That\nis, for Buber, experience was a meta-lingual phenomenon and thus\nlanguage was inferior to pure experience. For Buber, then, there is no\nessence of Judaism but there may be an essence of religious experience\nthat transcends language and thus particularity. Scholem rejected this\nand argued that Judaism can only be renewed through the historical\nconsciousness of Erfahrung or concrete historical experience.\nThis kind of experience is mediated through language, specifically, the\nlanguage of the textual tradition. Influenced by Walter\nBenjamin's early theory of language, Scholem argued that language\nwas of “divine origin” (however this is understood) and\nthus the experience of revelation was itself linguistic. For Scholem,\ntherefore, there is no essential religious experience as all\nhuman experience is mediated through language and thus particular to a\ncultural and linguistic context. He also held there was no essence of\nJudaism if by that we mean some core sets of values that can be\nexhibited in all forms of Jewish literature.  \n\nFor him Judaism is, according to one close reader of Scholem\n“an anarchistic plurality of sources.” Thus the best way to\nunderstand Judaism is through the philological and historical analysis\nof those sources without any pre-conceived vision of a grand narrative\nthat unites them. Scholem's position against the Essentialist\nschool surfaces in the first chapter of Major Trends where he\nstruggles to define the mystical experience. It surfaces again in the\n1960's and 1970's in light of the nature of language in\n“On the Name of God and Linguistic Theory in Kabbala.” The\n“Name of God” essay was a topic Scholem first expressed\ninterest in writing in the early 1920's until he realized he did\nnot have sufficient knowledge of Kabbala to do so. The essay was\npublished in two parts in 1972. In Major Trends he navigates a\nposition between the essentialists and the pure constructivist\nposition. It should be noted that even given Scholem's dependence\non language, he does not advocate a pure constructivist position on the\nnature of experience. That is, he does not argue there is\nsimply no meaning whatsoever to experience outside of language or that\nthere is no experience outside of language. Language for Scholem is a\nvehicle for understanding experience but whether it is, in fact, the\nvery origin of experience is something Scholem never definitively\nargues and remains a issue of debate among Scholem's\ninterpreters. \n\nThe historiographical dimension of Scholem's reconstruction of\nJudaism is perhaps his most contested thesis. He offers a kind of\nHegelian position. In brief it unfolds as follows: The biblical period\nis where Judaism struggles to free itself of pure myth and, while\npartially successful, never quite severs itself from the mythic world\nof its surroundings. This period is followed by the rabbinic period of\nlate antiquity introducing the institutional period of the Jewish\nreligion. The rabbis suppressed myth, magic, and cult in favor of a\nnormalized legal system that rationalized biblical mythic motifs and\npresented a God who, while not impersonal, was more distant from human\nexperience than in the biblical period which was centered on prophecy.\nThe Jewish Middle Ages began with Judaism's absorption of\nHellenistic/rational culture and produced a God even more distant than\nthe rabbinic God. Moreover, in this period while law remained\nobligatory it was challenged by reason as the sine qua non of the\nreligious life. Myth moves from a sate of suppression to being outright\nrejected. It is here, Scholem posits, that Kabbala enters. In part a\nreaction against medieval rationalism (curiously not unlike\nScholem's rejection of the Enlightenment rationalism of the\nScience of Judaism) Kabbala emerges in part to revive the biblical myth\nand also offer myths of its own born from a reification of rabbinic\nMidrash into a mystical cosmology. In Hegelian fashion, this mystical\nperiod then results in a renewal of rationalism in the Enlightenment\nwhere mysticism moves underground again (it is rejected by the\nproponents of the Science of Judaism) to be followed by its resurgence\nin yet another period of Jewish self-assertion and its re-connection to\nland and power in Zionism. This dialectical approach has been duly\ncriticized as “too neat” ignoring the messy edges of any\nhistorical epoch. For example, some have argued that Scholem\nintentionally downplays the mythic components in rabbinic Judaism and\nthe ways in which early kabbalists also fashioned themselves as\nphilosophers. For example, the ecstatic mystic Abraham Abulafia wrote\ncommentaries to Maimonides' rational work and did not consider\nhis own project as contradictory to Maimonides. The critique continues\nthat Scholem favored the more “mythic” kabbalistic schools\nsuch as the Rhineland pietists, the Zohar, Luria, Sabbatai Zevi, and\nHasidism because they serve his purpose and viewed those who do not as\nnot central to the historical trajectory of Kabbala. \n\nOne of the vexing questions in Scholem's historiographical\nrendering of Kabbala is the place of myth in medieval kabbalistic\nliterature. On the one hand, Scholem seems to prefer symbol over myth\nwhen discussing Kabbala, suggesting that Kabbala's reification of\nthe biblical narrative does not yield a mythic drama, including a cadre\nof mythic figures, but rather a series of symbolic clusters or\nhypostatic forms that are identified through the prism of the\npersonalities in the Hebrew Bible. On the other hand, in numerous\nplaces Scholem suggests Kabbala re-introduces myth into the Jewish\ndiscourse as a critique of Judaism's rational expositors. Critics\nhave suggested Scholem underestimated the mythic nature of theosophic\nKabbala (the Zohar and its interpreters) and was too invested in\nnotions of symbolism that were common in his time (e.g. Jung, Ricoeur,\nEliade). In any event, the question of myth versus symbol in Kabbala\nremains an important issue to be examined by Scholem's readers\nand future scholars. One important consequence of this question is\nwhether one defines Scholem's dialectical historiography as\nHegelian or psychoanalytic. If we say myth yields to symbolism in\nKabbala, Kabbala's new Jewish theology would better fit into the\nHegelian mode as an antithesis to medieval rationalism. If we say myth\ndominates symbol in Kabbala, we could argue for a case of the Freudian\n“return of the repressed” where the ancient Israelite myth\nrepressed by rabbinic institutionalization and medieval rationalism\nreturns to undermine both, even as it ostensibly remains wedded to the\northodoxy rabbinic Judaism provides. \n\nIn any case, it is hard to know exactly how seriously Scholem intended\nus to take his dialectical historiography or whether, in fact, it\nserved more as a heuristic tool to enable us to see a sweeping picture\nthat subsequent generations could revise. It is also worth considering\nhow much the warp and woof of the messianic and antinomian that\nunderlies much of Scholem's historiography of Kabbala is born\nfrom, and serves, his Zionism, In an interview a short time before his\ndeath he admitted that he believed his work was already\n“dated” and thus, I assume, in need of revision and\nrevaluation. Given the waning belief in grand narratives,\nScholem's historiography has met sharp criticism yet there is\nlittle doubt its main features have thus far stood the test of\ntime. \n\nA second component that accompanies Scholem's dialectic of myth,\nrationalism, and mysticism is his theory of esotericism. Committed to\nthe notion that social and cultural change are driven by ideas more\nthan events, Scholem adds that the ideas that often have the most\nprofound impact are esoteric ones that are suppressed yet surface when\ncertain historical conditions arise. This serves as one of his main\ncriticisms of Wissenschaft des Judentums, that is, that the\npresentation of Judaism without its esoteric components is not only\nbad history but misunderstands the main forces that drive change in\nJewish life and ideas. One scholar termed this Scholem's\n“counter-history.” For Scholem Judaism's ostensible\nanchor, tradition, is always in danger of undermining itself because\nit contains the seeds of its own demise in the form of esotericism,\nmysticism, and myth. As history unfolds, it often adjusts and survives\nits own inner challenge but other times, as in Sabbateanism, it does\nso only by a combination of draconian means (this often backfires) or\nby exercising its own elasticity to absorb the heretical and thereby\nmake it normative. \n\nFor Scholem, the one case where tradition may not have been able to\nrecover is modernity. For him modernity, and the secular, undermines\nthe central pillar of tradition, its belief in the divine nature of\nScripture. Once this goes, he posits, in some way the dialectic is\nbroken in that mysticism needs tradition as its foil in order to\nsurvive. The shattered ideational foundation of Jewish identity in\nmodernity can only be replaced with something that is heretical,\nmessianic, and secular: that is, Zionism. One scholar refers to this as\nScholem's “creative anarchy.” In his famous last\ncomments on the last page of Major Trends Scholem acknowledges\nthat modernity destroyed the conditions for mysticism as we knew it\nhistorically but he acknowledges it could indeed rise in a different\nguise in the future. This all seems to embody Scholem's own\nidentification as a “religious anarchist.” He may mean\nnumerous things by this enigmatic assertion. He may mean that he\nbelieves, as mentioned above, that Judaism has no essence but is only a\nseries of connected yet not always coherent textual traditions and sets\nof ideas. He may also mean that he believes controlled anarchy as the\ndemise of any heteronomous authority sets the proper conditions for the\ndiscovery of suppressed esoteric trends in a society. As he believes\nthese trends are crucial to understanding any culture, he supports\nreligious anarchy to the extent that it enables “the\nprofessor” of Jewish mysticism to do his (or her) work. In this\nsecond case, anarchy appears synonymous with secularity. \n\nAs mentioned, Scholem became a Zionist in 1911 when he was 14 years\nold. In many ways, and like many in his generation and locale, his\nZionism was one of protest against the bourgeois lifestyle and\nassimilated Jewish identity of his parents. In his native Germany\nHerzl's political Zionism was dominant but Scholem soon met\nEastern European immigrants and became exposed to the spiritual and\ncultural Zionism of Ahad ha-Am. He became involved in the Zionist youth\nmovement Blau Weiss (but later spoke out critically against it) and was\nstrongly influenced by the charismatic Martin Buber who was a leader\namong the Zionist youth in Germany at that time. He committed to\nimmigrating to Palestine quite early in his life, to some extent\nmotivated by the banishment from his home the fact that he was young,\nstill unmarried, and had few financial obligations. In any case, once\nhe arrived in Palestine he quickly became part of the German immigrant\nintelligentsia, some of whom had formed a group called Brit Shalom\ndedicated to the creation of a Jewish-Arab binational state. Some in\nthe group were committed radicals and liberals and others, like\nScholem, were more pragmatic in their approach, although he also viewed\nbinationalism as a moral obligation. In either case, almost all the\nmembers of Brit Shalom came from Germany (or spent time there) and,\nhaving experienced the Great War, had a bitter disdain for nationalism\nin general. They all saw the dangers of ethnocentric nationalism from\ntheir German past and all, as Zionists, wanted to deter any Jewish\nstate from repeating those errors. \n\nScholem's active participation in Brit Shalom was fairly\nshort-lived. He soured on the idea after the 1929 Hebron riots where\nPalestinian Arabs marauders attacked and killed Jewish civilians. This\nmassacre, which was a watershed event for many on the Jewish left at\nthat time, gave Scholem pause at to whether any true co-existence could\nbe possible. However, as late as 1937, in a letter to Walter Benjamin,\nhis life-long friend who never accepted Zionism, Scholem wrote against\npartition (of separate Jewish and Arab states) and upheld his belief in\nbinationalism as the “moral ideal solution.” After the\nHolocaust Scholem's belief in binationalism eroded even more,\neven though he never abandoned a belief that, given other\ncircumstances, it was the best option. In a letter in 1972 he admitted\nBrit Shalom had mistakenly read the historical situation and that\n“Hitler totally changed the perspective.” As time went on\nScholem became reconciled with the state, and even defended it,\nalthough be spoke vociferously against the settlements after 1967 and\ncorrectly saw the movement as a dangerous combination of messianic\ntriumphalism and mystical optimism. \n\nScholars disagree as to the extent Scholem separated the two parts of\nhis life, first as a scholar of Jewish mysticism and second as a public\nintellectual, particularly a Zionist. Some argue that his Zionism is\nreflected in his entire scholarly career while others suggest he\nsuccessfully bifurcated both parts of his life. As a believer in the\nalmost mystical power of language he maintained that the revival of the\nHebrew language in Mandate Palestine/Israel was necessary to bring the\nesoteric components of the tradition — founded so deeply on the\nplay of language — to the fore. He also believed that Zionism in\nMandate Palestine/Israel, as a growing culture in need of a new\nidentity, was fertile ground for a renaissance constructed from the\nresources of forgotten dimensions of the tradition. This is not to say\nhe believed in some kind of neo-kabbalistic culture. He did not.\nScholem remained a committed secularist throughout his life believing,\nI think, that secularism and secular Zionism were a crucial part of any\nnew Jewish society. Perhaps, then, even those who maintain that\nScholem's academic work is not tainted by his ideology can agree\nthat for him Zionism, in its cultural and political manifestations,\nserved as the necessary frame for his project of reconstructing Jewish\nhistory from the perspective of mystical esotericism. \n\nThroughout his career Scholem played the important role of public\nintellectual in Mandate Palestine/Israel. He often wrote in Israeli\nnewspapers, magazines, was frequently interviewed in print and radio,\nand weighed in on a variety of political, cultural, and social issues.\nMany of these essays were collected in the two-volume Devarim\nbe-Go published in 1976 and a third volume entitled ‘Od\nDavar published in 1989. A selection of these and other essays\nwere published in English in Jews and Judaism in Crisis, 1976\nand more recently in On the Possibility of Jewish Mysticism\nToday, 1997. In these volumes Scholem reflects on everything from\nthe state of the university, general Israeli education, Israeli\npolitics, the state of the Diaspora, and personal reflections of his\nown on studying Jewish mysticism. These include book reviews, short\ncomments about his contemporaries, and letters he wrote to various\ncolleagues and friends. One of his most well-known, and revealing,\nletters about his own investment in the study of Kabbala was a 1925\nletter to the Israeli poet Hayyim Nahman Bialik that was published in\nHebrew in Devarim be-Go and now appears in German translation.\nScholem knew the importance of his stature as the founder of the modern\nstudy of Kabbala and he responded by engaging with issues of his day\nfrom that perch. He was often self-deprecating about his\n“popular” essays but he took them very seriously and they\noccupied a fair amount of his psyche and energy. \n\nHe also wrote hundreds of letters to scholars and dignitaries around\nthe world that have recently been published in Gershom Scholem: A\nLife in Letters: 1914–1982. The correspondence between him and\nWalter Benjamin was published separately as The Correspondence of\nGershom Scholem and Walter Benjamin: 1932–1940. A volume of his\npoetry was published as In the Fullness of Time: Poems, 2003.\nA new volume of his early diaries has just been published as\nLamentations of Youth: the Diaries of Gershom Scholem,\n1913–1919, 2008. \n\nComing in Israel in the 1920's when Zionism was still a\nrevolutionary cultural project Scholem knew he was in the midst of a\nsecular revolution whose origins, according to him, extended back to\nthe distant esoteric past. His role was not simply to unearth but also\nto interpret, not only publish but to educate a generation. He was\narguably the most important Jewish Studies scholar in the twentieth\ncentury and surely one of its most important and influential\nvoices. \n\nThe hundreds of texts and personalities he brought to light from\nlate antiquity to modernity and the forcefulness and complexity of his\ngrand theses about Kabbala and Jewish history has fed more than three\ngenerations of scholars and will surely nurture many more. More\nrecently, he is being discovered in European circles as an important\nfigure in Weimar Jewish culture. Serious studies in German are\npresently being published by young scholars who know little about\nKabbala and do not have much interest in Zionism but view Scholem as an\nimportant intellectual and philosophical mind compared with such\nfigures as Benjamin, Strauss, Adorno, Horkheimer, and Arendt. His\nintellectual reach was, in fact, extraordinary, and thus this new\ninterest should be celebrated.","contact.mail":"smagid@indiana.edu","contact.domain":"indiana.edu"}]
