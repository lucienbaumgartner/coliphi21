He is primarily known for his long collaboration\nwith his friend Wilhelm Dilthey (1833–1911) and for his impact\non Martin Heidegger (1889–1976) and Hans-Georg Gadamer\n(1900–2002). Together with Dilthey, Yorck was the first\nphilosopher to elaborate the specific concept of historicity\n[Geschichtlichkeit] as a defining characteristic in\nthe ontology of human beings. In particular, Yorck\nemphasized the generic difference between the ontic and the\nhistorical, i.e., the difference between what is seen or\nconceptualized (and aesthetically contemplated) as permanent nature,\nor essence, or idea, and the felt historical rhythm of life, i.e.,\nlife's immersion in and belonging to the overarching and always\nchanging waves of history. In contradistinction to Dilthey's\nepistemological endeavors to clarify the foundations of the historical\nsciences vis-à-vis the natural sciences, Yorck aimed\nexclusively at the ontology of historical life, particularly the\nhistorical band (syndesmos) and effective connection\n(virtuality) that unites generational life. Based on the\nprimacy of historical life, Yorck adopted a decidedly\nanti-metaphysical stance, rejecting all claims of knowledge\nsub specie aeternitatis. He combined this with a Christian,\nparticularly Lutheran, conception of a historical and personal but\nentirely transcendent God, relative to whom each individual person, in\ninescapable singularity, defines his or her own life story.  Yorck's\nideas were first made public in the form of a posthumous volume of\nhis Correspondence with Dilthey in 1923 (Yorck 1923). Through\nthis publication he influenced not only Heidegger (see Farin 2016 and\nRuin 1994) and Gadamer (1990), but also Misch, Rothacker, Scholem,\nBultmann, Marcuse, and others. Between 1956 and 1970 various\nunfinished fragments of Yorck's writings were published\n(see Bibliography). They contain the outline of\nYorck's systematic psychology of history and history of philosophy, as\nwell as extensive reflections on the partial negation or suppression\nof temporality in thought and metaphysics (due to the inherently\nspatial character of representation and thought as such). These later\nworks have not received as much attention as his earlier views in\nhis Correspondence with Dilthey.\n\n\n\nCount Paul Yorck von Wartenburg was born in Berlin on March 1, 1835.\nHis grandfather was the famous Field Marshal Hans David Ludwig Yorck\nvon Wartenburg. (The Field Marshal's courageous signing of the\nConvention of Tauroggen, originally unauthorized by the king and thus\nin effect treasonous, started the Prussian War of Liberation against\nNapoleon in 1813. It made the Field Marshal Yorck a national hero.)\nPaul Yorck's father, Ludwig David Yorck von Wartenburg, managed\nthe family's estate at Klein-Oels in Silesia (near Breslau, today\nWrokław) where Paul Yorck grew up. Paul Yorck's parents were\nwell-connected to a number of literary, philosophical, and artistic\ncircles in Berlin and elsewhere. They were acquainted with Friedrich Schleiermacher,\nLudwig Tieck, Bettina von Arnim, Alexander von Humboldt, Karl August\nVarnhagen, Johann Gustav Droysen, Karl Friedrich Schinkel, and Ernst\nvon Wildenbruch, to name but a few. The family Yorck von Wartenburg\nbelonged to the dominant elite in Prussia and the German Empire.\nYorck's life-long enthusiasm for history and historical reality\nmust be seen against this biographical background.\n \n\nIn 1855 Paul Yorck began his university studies in law at Bonn, but\nsoon moved to the university at Breslau where he also enrolled in\nphilosophy courses. After passing the second law exam, Yorck published\nhis exam essay “The Catharsis of Aristotle and Sophocles’\nOedipus of Colonus” (Yorck 1866), the only publication by him\nduring his lifetime. When his father passed away in 1865 Yorck took\nover the management of the family estate at Klein-Oels. He also assumed\nhis father's hereditary seat in the Prussian Upper Chamber\n[Herrenhaus] where he participated in political debates. He\ntook part in the Franco-Prussian war (1870–1871); and he was present at\nthe Proclamation of the German Empire in the Hall of Mirrors at the\nPalace of Versailles in 1871.  \n\nIn the same year Yorck met Dilthey, who had been called to the\nUniversity at Breslau. They quickly became friends and Dilthey was a\nfrequent guest at Klein-Oels, often staying for prolonged working\nholidays. The posthumously published Dilthey–Yorck\nCorrespondence (Yorck 1923) is an impressive testimony to this\nfriendship.  \n\nFrom the early 1890s Yorck worked on a manuscript on Heraclitus\n(Yorck 1896/97) and a book about the Stances of Consciousness and\nHistory (Yorck\n 1892–1897).[1]\nBefore his death, Yorck declared the two works unfinished and not ready\nfor publication. Published only posthumously, they are, in the words of\nKarlfried Gründer (1970, 55), “sketches” of first\ndrafts for “great philosophical books.” Paul Yorck died at\nKlein-Oels, September 12, 1897. His grandson, Count Peter Yorck, who\nhad studied Yorck's unfinished works, was a leading member of the\nKreisauer Circle, the German resistance cell responsible for the failed\nattempt to assassinate Hitler on July 20, 1944. \n\nWhen in 1923 the Correspondence between Yorck and Dilthey\n(Yorck 1923) (abbreviated hereafter as CR) was published as “a\nmemorial” to their philosophical friendship (CR, VI), it\nestablished Yorck not only as an equal to Dilthey and a faithful\ninterlocutor and eager co-worker on Dilthey's\n project(s),[2]\nbut also as a philosopher and keen\nobserver of his times in his own right.\n \n\nIn 1892 Yorck writes to Dilthey:  Our time portends something\nof an end of an epoch. A token of this is the disappearance of the\nelemental pleasure in historical realities. The feeling that everything\npasses [Gefühl der Vergänglichkeit] haunts\nthe world once again. (CR, p. 140)  Dilthey clearly shares this\nsentiment. In a more extensive note about the same topic Yorck writes:\n \nIt is my growing conviction that today we stand at a historical\nturning point similar to the one of the 15th century. In\ncontradistinction to the scientific-technological progress, which\nconsists in increased abstraction and isolation, a new formation comes\ninto being because the human being in his entirety [der ganze\nMensch] once again takes a stand and faces the problems of life.\nEvery time it is a new stance towards life [Lebensstellung]\nand a new conception of it that ushers in a new epoch, not any old\ndiscovery or invention, even if it is of the greatest import. The\nthread on which science hangs has become so long and spun ever so thin,\nthat now it is snapping in the face of the impetuous question: What is\ntruth? (CR, p. 128)  \nIn yet another letter, Yorck claims\nthat, since the Renaissance, science and knowledge—abstracted\nfrom feeling and volition—have followed an eccentric\ntrajectory, in which they have lost sight of man, resulting in profound\nself-alienation: The ripple effects caused by the eccentric\nprinciple, which ushered in a new age more than four hundred years ago,\nseem to me to have become exceedingly broad and flat; knowledge has\nadvanced to the point of nullifying itself, and man has become so far\nremoved from himself that he no longer catches sight of himself.\n‘Modern’ man, that is, man since the Renaissance, is fit\nfor the grave. (CR, p. 83)  The general thrust of these reflections\nand the language used are reminiscent of Nietzsche's descriptions\nof the “uncanniest of all guests,” nihilism. In fact, it is\nthe usually so cautious Dilthey who, in one of his last letters to\nYorck, remarks that the true but “horrible word about the age has\nbeen announced” by no one other than Nietzsche (CR, p. 238). There\nis no reason to believe that Yorck would have disagreed. \n\nYorck's and Dilthey's awareness of an epochal shift,\nwritten some twenty years before World War I, could not fail to impress\nthe generation of students who, in the aftermath of this European\ncatastrophe, their predicament exacerbated by continued economic\nhardship and hyperinflation, returned to studying philosophy in the\nearly 1920s. This may explain why, much later, in the 1980s, Gadamer\nwould still speak of the enormous significance of the publication of\nthe Dilthey–Yorck correspondence in 1923, calling it an\n“epoch-making moment” in its own\n right (Gadamer 1995, p. 8).\n \nAccording to Yorck, the analysis and evaluation of the contemporary\nintellectual-historical situation is integral to philosophy—all\nthe more so if philosophy self-reflexively grasps its ineluctably\nhistorical nature, which in itself is one of Yorck's main\nphilosophical objectives. The basic idea for the historicity of\nphilosophy is straightforward. For Yorck, as for Dilthey, philosophy is\n“a manifestation of life”\n[Lebensmanifestation] (CR, p. 250), a product or an\nexpression in which life articulates itself in a certain way. But all\nlife is intrinsically historical. Life is inconceivable without its\nhistorical development. Yorck writes: The entire given\npsycho-physical reality is not something that is, but\nsomething that lives: that is the germ cell of historicity. And\nself-reflection, which is directed not at an abstract I, but the\nentirety of my own self, will find that I am historically determined,\njust as physics grasps me as determined by the cosmos. Just as I am\nnature, I am history. And in this decisive sense we have to understand\nGoethe's dictum of [our] having lived [Gelebthaben] for\nat least three thousand years. Conversely, it follows that history as a\nscientific discipline exists only as psychology of history. (CR\n71/72) \n\nFor Yorck, as for Dilthey, human life is incorrectly understood if\nit is subsumed under the generic catch-all category of\n“existence.” The first point is that human life is\ninconceivable without temporal and historical development, movement,\nand change; life always transcends itself, hence it never simply\n“is.” The mode of being for humans is “life,”\nnot\n “existence.”[3]\nAnd life, unlike existence, is intrinsically historical. Precisely this\ndistinction is brought home by Yorck's demand to always observe\n“the generic difference between the ontic and the\nhistorical” (CR, p. 191). The ontic is what is simply\n“there” without inner life, temporality, or history. It\nincludes the physical entities in the world, as well as abstract\nobjects, numbers, essences, ideas, etc. The “ontic” is\ntoto caelo other than “the historical.”\nYorck's second point is that all history is a development\nof human powers or human psychology, where psychology does not\nmean some inert or fixed “nature,” but the constant play of\nforces, the ever shifting configurations between understanding,\naffectivity, and volition. (See Section 3.1 below.)\n \n\nIn addition, Yorck emphasizes the “virtuality” or\n“effectivity” of history, i.e., the cumulative effects and\nresults of individual persons exerting power and influence in\ntransmitting the possibility and conception of life to their\ndescendants. Successor-generations develop their own stance towards\nlife in response to what they have inherited from the individuals and\ngenerations preceding them. History is the ongoing transmission of\nlife's potentiality, including the transmission of power, ideas,\nand material conditions.  The child gains through the\nmother's sacrifice, her sacrifice benefits the child. Without\nsuch virtual transmission of power [Kraftübertragung]\nthere is no history at all. (CR, p. 155)  Yorck does not refer to\nsome anonymous bio-power or power structures, as discussed in much of\ncontemporary philosophy, but to the authority, sacrifice, and direct\naction and communication through which an individual person or groups\nof persons form and shape the lives and behaviours of coming\ngenerations. It is for this reason that Yorck insists that\n“person” is the key historical category (CR, p. 109). History\nis the history of historical, individual agents, projecting their power\nand authority into the future.  \n\nSince Yorck understands history as a connecting band of ideas and\nconditions passed on from one person to another, and indeed from one\ngeneration to another, his position must not be associated with\nhistoricism. For Yorck, there is one continuous and common line of\nhistorical life—a living syndesmos. Past generations\nand past persons are not “outside” a present horizon in a\npast world of their own. Rather, they live on, as it were, in their\ndescendents. Moreover, because of this connecting band, one can go\n“backwards” by way of what Yorck calls\n“transposition” (CR, p. 61), transposing oneself into the\nlives of others and thus “re-enacting,” as Dilthey would\nsay, the positions towards life that have been lived by one's\npredecessors. That life is historical means that each person is always\nalready outside his or her own individual “nature” and\nplaced within the historical connection to predecessor- and\nsuccessor-generations. For Yorck, living self-consciousness is, to use\nHegel's fortuitous phrase, “the I that is\n we and the we that is I” (Hegel 1807, p. 140).\n \nConsequently, Yorck rejects from the start the transcendental method\nin philosophy as insufficient for grasping lived historical reality.\nTranscendental philosophy reduces historical life to the merely\n“subjective,” which misses the genuine characteristic of\nGeist, spirit or mind, namely its real, historical extension\nand connection. As Yorck puts it, “the transcendental\nmethod” merely suspends or sublates “the realm of the\nobjective,” but it fails to “extend the region of\nGeist” (CR, p. 194). Insisting that “the\ncharacter of subjectivity does not even reach the realm of\nGeist” (CR, p. 194), Yorck clearly implies that the\n“realm of history” is the proper domain for Geist. It follows\nthat, despite his criticism of the narrow confines of transcendental\nand/or subject-centred philosophy, Yorck's philosophical\nconception of history is still inscribed within the confines of\nGeist-philosophy. Following Hegel, who argues that everything hinges\non the understanding that “substance is\n subject” (Hegel 1807, p. 19),\nYorck agrees that\neverything hinges on the understanding that “substance is\nhistory” or “substance is historical\n spirit.”[4] \n\nYorck's primary category of historical life does not only\nchallenge transcendental philosophy as too-narrow a foothold for\nphilosophy. A fortiori, it also challenges the entire\nmetaphysical tradition, which presupposes or searches for an ultimate\nobjective reality (being, idea, substance, and so on), divorced from\nthe ground of the always shifting historical life. Yorck rejects claims\nto “knowledge” sub specie aeternitatis. For Yorck,\nmetaphysics is a flight from the historical reality ‘on the\nground.’ By making historical life primary, Yorck effectively\naims to dismantle the predominance of Greek metaphysics, including the\nmodes of thought of modern science derived from it. \n\nBut Yorck is not content with just opposing metaphysics and\ntranscendental philosophy. Instead, he attempts to instill and to\ncultivate historical awareness in philosophy itself, based on the\nprinciple that all productions of life are as historical as life\nitself. He writes: Since “to philosophize is to live,”\n“there is no real philosophizing which would not be\nhistorical” (CR, p. 251). More radical than Dilthey, Yorck calls for\nthe “historicization”\n[Vergeschichtlichung] of philosophy:  Just as physiology cannot abstract from physics, so\nphilosophy—especially if it is critical—cannot abstract\nfrom historicity [Geschichtlichkeit]. After all, the\nuncritical\nCritique of Kant's can be understood historically only,\nand thus be overcome. [Human] behaviour and historicity are like\nbreathing and air pressure—and—this may sound somewhat\nparadoxical—the failure to historicize philosophizing appears\nto me, in methodological respects, a metaphysical remnant. (CR,\n69)  It is therefore not surprising that, unlike Dilthey, Yorck\nspecifically appreciates the emphasis on historicity\n [Geschichtlichkeit][5]\nin\nHegel and some of his followers, despite his rejection of Hegel's\nspeculative or ontical superstructure (CR,\n 59).[6] \n\nIn light of the historical nature of philosophy, Yorck draws two\ndecisive methodological inferences. First, he rejects as too rigid and\nuntenable the opposition between theoretical or systematic philosophy\nand the history of ideas (CR, p. 251), because, as an ongoing historical\ndevelopment, philosophy always requires both a genetic and historical\nclarification, as well as a systematic and theoretical account. Instead\nof a mutually exclusive relation, Yorck sees a mutually productive\ncombination. Second, because Yorck always includes the present\nsituation within the domain of history, he calls for a\n“critical,” and not “antiquarian,” or\nquietistic mode of philosophizing (CR, p. 19). Speaking for Dilthey and\nhimself, Yorck argues that this critical work of philosophy lays the\ngroundwork for the practical intent or the historical vocation of\nphilosophy:  The potential for practical application is of course\nthe real justification for any science. Yet mathematical\npraxis is not the only kind. In practical terms, our\nstandpoint is pedagogical in intent, in the broadest and deepest sense\nof the word. It is the soul of all true philosophy and the truth of\nPlato and Aristotle. (CR, pp. 42/ 43) \n\nIn the condensed and all too general format of the\nCorrespondence with Dilthey, Yorck develops the practical\n“application” of philosophy in only the most fragmentary\nfashion. Its most important part is the actual clarification of the\ncontemporary situation, the determination of the given historical\npossibilities, and the avenues for implementing some of them. Yorck\nholds that since the Renaissance and through the works of such thinkers\nas Galileo, Descartes, and Hobbes, the self-interpretation of life has\nfound its centre of gravity in the cultivation of the theoretical\nunderstanding [Verstand]. The primacy accorded to theoretical\nunderstanding and what it projects as objective, unchangeable, and\nultimate reality (metaphysical & physical) has ushered in\n“the natural sciences,” “nominalism,”\n“rationalism,” and “mechanism,” (CR, pp. 68, 63\n& 155). But this has come at the exclusion of the full\nthematization, expression, and appreciation of human affectivity\n[Gefühl], including the underlying feeling of human\nconnectivity through a shared life in history. Blocked-out are\nquestions which affect the temporal, historical and personal existence\nof human beings, or what Yorck once calls “existential\nquestions” [Existenzialfragen] (CR, p. 62), which relate to\nthe life-goals human beings strive after, the recognition of\ndependency, and the awareness of human mortality, finitude, and death\n(CR, p. 120). The relative sidelining of these aspects in the psychology\nof human beings lies at the bottom of Yorck's diagnosis of the\nincreasing self-alienation of modern man and the crisis of his\ntime. \n\nWith Dilthey, Yorck attempts to highlight the “full human\nbeing” [den ganzen Menschen] (CR, p. 157), as opposed\nto the rationalistically reduced, one-dimensional individual that has\npreoccupied modern philosophy and shaped modern culture. The\nhistoricization of philosophy belongs to this project, as does the\nacknowledgment of transcendence. According to Yorck, transcendence\n(CR, pp. 120, 144) facilitates the withdrawal from the world in its\nobjective reality (as represented by thought and metaphysics). It lets\nhuman life pivot around the personal, historical, and affective\ndimension, foregrounding personal responsibility and accountability to\nthe transcendent God. Against the theoretical-metaphysical stance\ndirected at an ever present objective reality, Yorck insists on the\nprimacy of the personal, historical relation to the transcendent God.\nYorck's dictum “Transcendence contra metaphysics!”\nexpresses not only a very strong leitmotif in his philosophical\nthought (CR, p. 42); it is actually the very\ncapstone.[7] For\nthis reason, Yorck has been interpreted as a religious existentialist\n(Kaufmann, 1928). This sets him apart from Dilthey. Yorck's conception\nof Christianity is heavily biased in favour of Luther's\ntheology. According to Yorck, Luther's anti-metaphysical, historical\nstance towards transcendence remains a historical task for the future\ndevelopment of philosophy (CR, pp. 144 & 145).  \n\nSince Yorck frequently and conspicuously uses the term\nBodenlosigkeit [groundlessness], or bodenloses\nDenken [groundless thought] to describe the one-sided\nintellectualism of the scientific-technological civilization since the\nRenaissance (CR, pp. 39, 103, 250, 230, 143), questions have been raised\nabout Yorck's preference for autochthony\n[Bodenständigkeit] and the political\nimplications\n thereof.[8] \n\nMore than half a century after his death, three philosophical\nfragments by Yorck—originally written in the last six years of\nhis life—were published between 1956 and 1970 (see the\nBibliography). The most important is entitled\nBewusstseinsstellung und Geschichte [“Stances of\nConsciousness and History”] (abbreviated hereafter as ST). It\naddresses the sources and the development of human history, providing\nthe philosophical underpinning and more detailed exploration of views\nthat Yorck had mentioned in his\nCorrespondence with Dilthey. The following section presents\nthe major points of this systematic fragment.\n \n\nYorck's main aim is to provide an analysis of the underlying\npsychology of human life, which he considers the basis for all\nhistorical development. According to Yorck, particular configurations\nin the psychology of man, or stances of consciousness, determine the\ndominant shape of historical epochs. In other words, certain positions\nadopted on the level of “primary life” [primäre\nLebendigkeit], the stances taken by consciousness within life,\ndetermine “historical life” [historische\nLebendigkeit] at large and can define entire epochs (ST,\np. 5; also pp. 52, 53). Therefore, Yorck speaks of the\n“psychology of history” and, the “philosophic\nhistory of philosophy” (which traces the stances of\nconsciousness through empirical history) (ST, p. 10). \n\nAll this is predicated on the supposition of our intuitive access to\npsychological or primary life through “self-reflection”\n[Selbstbesinnung]. Yorck interprets Dilthey's insight that\none cannot go beyond life to mean that one cannot surpass or transcend\n“the empirical givenness of self-consciousness,” which\nentails that philosophy is “empirical,” not speculative\n(ST, pp. 8, 3). Evidence can only be found in self-consciousness. What\ndoes not pass the test in one's own life cannot count as a valid\nexpression of life: The seat of all necessary truth is\n“self-experimentation” (ST, 9, also\n54).[9] \n\nNot unlike Husserl, Yorck pursues, albeit without an elaborate set of\nmethodological rules, a “re-duction” of all objectivity to\nself-consciousness, where self-consciousness is a living and historical\nstructure that cannot be restricted to knowing or any other particular\nfunction of life. As Gadamer (1990, pp. 246–269) has pointed out,\ndespite his critique of transcendental philosophy, Yorck may be read as\nactually expanding the transcendental focus, which traditionally used\nto be on knowing, so as to include the entire gamut of human\nexperiences and their necessary conditions in human\nlife. Following Dilthey, Yorck sees human consciousness\nas a living structure where the emphasis lies on its\n“aliveness,” Lebendigkeit, which includes not only\noutward-directed intentionality towards objectivity (representation and\nvolition), but also self-awareness, and self-feeling of inner life.\nClose to Schleiermacher, Yorck even specifies that “the ultimate\ndatum” in self-consciousness is “the feeling of life”\n[Lebensgefühl] itself (ST, p. 11). \n\nAccording to Yorck, life is divided and articulated in itself,\nnamely as an ongoing process of self-differentiation relative to others\nand the environment. Yorck writes: The primary and exclusive\ndatum is self-consciousness, which, although divided\n[dirimiert] into self and other, soul and lived body\n[Leib], I and world, inner and outer, is nonetheless, polarity\n[Gegensätzlichkeit] and articulateness\n[Gegliedertheit] in one. But self-consciousness experiences\nitself in the play and counter-play of its constitutive factors, that\nis, as something alive [ein Lebendiges]. This\naliveness is the basic constitution. (ST, p. 8)  But there is no way\nthat this aliveness can ever be grasped in its purity outside the\nfundamental differentiation. The antithetical division in\n“self” and “other” is so fundamental that one\ncannot go back behind it.  The separation [Trennung] of\nself and other, I and world, soul and lived body [Leib] is\nsuch an early separation, indeed, the first act of life, as it were,\nsuch that these derivatives appear as absolute, autonomous, and\nself-sufficient. (ST, pp. 11/12)  Yorck concludes: “The self is\nonly through the other, just as the other is only through the\nself” (ST, p. 11). \n\nYet “life” remains the primary datum for Yorck.\nReminiscent of German Idealism, particularly Hegel and Hölderlin,\nYorck understands life as “differentiated unity”\n[differenzierte Einheitlichkeit] (ST, p. 38). Life\nexplicates itself in form of an inner division and polarity. Each\nstance of life is a particular configuration of life's original\ndivision [Urtheil or Urtheilung] (ST, p. 25). Yorck\nwrites:  Observation shows that primary life manifests a double\ndiremption into [1] polarity [Gegensätzlichkeit] and [2]\ndifference [Verschiedenheit], such that the character of\npolarity permeates and determines the elements of the\narticulation. (ST, p. 10)  Life articulates or expresses itself differently\nin three “functions” or “comportments”\n[Verhaltungen], as life is lived in [1] “feeling”\n[Empfinden] or affectivity, [2] “willing”\n[Wollen], and [3] “cognizing”\n[Vorstellen] (ST, 32). Life is divided between the\ntwo antithetical or opposite poles of spontaneity and dependence (ST,\np. 9), which, applied to the different comportments or functions of\nlife, yields [1] the tension between motivation and spontaneity in\nvolition, [2] the opposition in cognition between objective,\nmatter-of-fact representation [Sachlichkeit] and spontaneous\nprojection of formed images [Bildlichkeit] as the object of\nknowledge, and [3] the polarity between dependence on others versus\nownness [Eigenheit] in the domain of affectivity (ST,\np. 32). \n\nYorck claims that the three psychological “functions” or\ncomportments circumscribe the fixed and unalterable “natural\nground” [Naturboden], or the parameters within which\nall human history is played out (ST, p. 26). There is no history\nwithout such fixed reference points. The economy of the three\nfunctions is not fixed (unlike the functions as such), but is always\nopen to the play of shifting configurations and imbalances (ST, p. 24\n& 54). More specifically, the three functions are neither\nreducible to each other nor derivable from another source, making them\nin effect equiprimordial. However, they stand in a variable and\ninverse relationship to each other, where the relative preponderance\nof one function is offset by the relative subordination of the\nremaining ones, but at no time can any particular function be\ncancelled out altogether (ST, p. 98). This inverse relationship,\ncoupled with the internal polarity within each function, accounts for\n“the restlessness of primary life” (ST, p. 32). Since life\ndoes not exist in some generality, but only as a particular\nconfiguration or alignment of its functions, the overall\n“totality” of the shape of a particular life is always\ndetermined by a pre-dominant position of one of its functions (ST,\np. 55). This lopsidedness, which necessarily fails to express life in\nits “entire\n fullness”[10]\n (ST, p. 54), results in the instability\nof each particular shape of consciousness. Each real configuration of\nconsciousness and its particular bias to one function, as well as one\nof the antithetical poles within, lends itself to a new correction, a\nnew stance of consciousness, which, in turn is only a particular form,\nbiased to a particular function, and so on. As “historical\nlife” is nothing other than “primary life” writ\nlarge, Yorck holds that this inbuilt instability and restlessness in\nprimary life also constitutes the “engine of history” (ST,\n33). (See Section 3.2 below.) \n\nYorck holds that two functions of life, willing and cognition, are\n“eccentric;” they pursue objects that are projected outside\nthe felt interiority of self-consciousness (ST, p. 120). Concerning\nrepresentation or cognition, Yorck writes: Self-reflection\nreveals representation [Vorstellen] as an act of\nexteriorization, as a projection, which therefore is primarily marked\nby its opposition to feeling. The feature of projection, [i.e.,]\nexpulsion from within [innere Entfernen], being the\ncharacteristic element of all representation, is spatialization\n[Verraümlichung] as such. (ST, p. 70)  Spatialization\nis thus necessary for representation or the work of the understanding,\nthought. By contrast, temporality (located in affectivity) is not at\nall necessary for cognition or representation: Thought can\nabstract from temporality. Indeed, every act of thought contains\n[…] an abstraction from [temporality], inasmuch as thought\ninvolves an expropriation [of inner feeling]. By contrast, spatiality\nis the precondition of all\n thought.[11]\n(ST, p. 147)  All thought is inherently spatial,\nrepresenting objects at a distance in space: “Spatiality is the\nbasic character of all thought” (ST, p. 119). According to Yorck,\nthought or cognition may abstract from particular characters of space,\nsuch as “direction” and “place,” but it cannot\ndo without the projective opening of spatiality as such (ST, p. 100). And\nYorck suggests that it is the inherent spatiality in all thought which,\nwithin the intellectualist tradition of the West, has rendered\n“space” an unsurpassable “metaphysical”\nreality, or transcendental condition of reality as such (ST, p. 100).\nSince thought or cognition is an achievement of life in abstraction\nfrom temporality and feeling, space itself appears as eternal, neutral\nexteriority. \n\nYorck emphasizes that cognition of objects in space amounts to an\nact of “liberation,” because what has been\n“placed” at a “psychological distance” in the\nrealm of an eternal, and neutral objectivity has lost its power over\nthe representing subject, has no impact on the person's\naffectivity, and can no longer excite the feeling that everything\npasses away (ST, p. 74).  \n\nThere is thus a positive correlation between cognition and volition.\nCognitive projection is already an attempt to gain a foothold relative\nto “the flight of impressions, appearances, and\nstrivings,” and the fixation of an object in space goes hand in\nhand with the search for self-constancy and\n“self-affirmation” [Selbstbehauptung] (ST,\np. 66). Therefore, Yorck holds that philosophy and science, as\ncognitive comportments in life, are rooted in the striving for\nself-affirmation. He thus attributes an eminent ethical impetus to\nthem. “Freedom” and “autonomy” are the\npsychological motivation for philosophy and science (ST, p. 42). \n\nIn contrast to cognition and volition, which are\n“eccentric” and directed towards the “outer,”\nfeeling or affectivity [Gefühl or Empfindung]\nis the awareness of inwardness or interiority. Yorck writes:\n“The essence of the inner [des Innen] is feeling\n[Empfindung]” (ST, p. 71). At the limit, feeling is\nobject-less and an immersion in subjective life. As Yorck explains,\nfeelings are only secondarily attached to objects. Pain or pleasure,\nfor instance, has no “representational content”\n[Vorstellungsinhalt]. Yorck writes: When “I feel, I\nstay within me” (ST, 71)—chez moi, bei\nmir. Feeling is only minimally projective. However, since\npolarity permeates all psychological functions, Yorck is quick to\nrecognize “a relation” to the other, for there is no\n“inner” without an\n“outer.”[12] \nBut the centre of feeling or affectivity\nis the sphere of one's own, pure interiority, not as representation,\nbut as something felt. Therefore, it is the actual seat of “all\nthings personal” [alles Persönliche], the\ninnermost centre of personal life (ST, p. 85). It is the\n“central” and immediate pulse of life, antecedent to the\nobjectifications by cognition and volition (ST, p. 14). Yorck writes:\n“The relation of self to feeling is more immediate” than\nthe subject's relation to representation (ST, p. 99). Since the\npersonal is something\nfelt in the interiority of one's life, and not something\nthought or represented and projected outwards, Yorck concludes\nthat self-relation is not cognitive in the first place; it is not\n“knowledge” (ST, p. 72). Therefore, Yorck also finds it a\nmisguided effort “to grasp natural and historical communities by\nmeans of representation,” because it misses the felt personal\nattachment, which alone lends reality to the historical connectivity\nand relation (ST, p. 72). Already in the Correspondence, Yorck\nhad stated that “historical reality is a reality of feeling\n[Empfindungsrealität]” (CR, p. 113).\n \n\nNext, Yorck also claims that “time originates in feeling”\n(ST, p. 135). But as feeling is non-projective, it follows that,\noriginally, “temporality” is not\n“objective”[13]\n (ST, 146). Yorck distinguishes between\nthe feeling of transitoriness, i.e., that everything passes away\n[Vergänglichkeitsgefühl] (ST, p. 33), and the\nfeeling or awareness of one's own mortality\n[Sterblichkeitsgefühl][14]\n (ST, p. 90). Acquiescence into one's own\nmortality constitutes the opposite pole to self-affirmation,\n“self-renunciation” [Selbsthingabe]\n(ST, p. 14), which is thus distinct from and even antithetical to the\nethical impetus in philosophy and science. Yorck argues that the\ninversion of volitional and cognitive projection in feeling and its\nconcentration in pure, passive interiority amounts to a\n“religious comportment” and the feeling of dependency (ST,\n121). To the extent that the religious concentration of life in\ninteriority is inversely related to projective representation, Yorck\nunderstands religious life in terms of its “freedom from the\nworld” or Weltfreiheit (ST, p. 81 &\n112). Psychologically, freedom from the world is the precondition for\nthe consciousness of a world-transcendent God, or the consciousness of\ntranscendence (ST, p. 105). Yorck only hints at the projection\nsui generis involved in transcendence. But it is a\nprojection that has no cognitive or volitional content, such that God\nis intended without becoming “an object,” and willing\nbecomes a “non-willing,” albeit without loss of energy (ST,\n104). \n\nDrawing on Dilthey and Schleiermacher, Yorck argues that immediate\nand indubitable reality of life is exclusively “guaranteed”\nthrough volition and affectivity alone. Yorck writes: “That which\nopposes me or that which I feel, I call real,” because I cannot\ndoubt what resists my will or affects my personal life, whereas it is\nalways possible to doubt objects neutrally represented in space outside\nme (ST, p. 89). What is thought and grasped as an unchanging, stable and\nself-same object in the space of thought does not affect me or solicit\na desire. For Yorck, cognition, in abstraction from feeling and\nvolition, is the realm of pure “phenomenality,” which is\nalways open to doubt in virtue of its being merely represented or\nthought (ST, p. 88). Because “the category of reality is a predicate\nof feeling and willing” alone (ST, p. 128), Yorck concludes that it\nis an “utterly uncritical” and self-contradictory\nundertaking to attempt to prove “the reality of the world”\nby means of the understanding (ST, p. 129). What Yorck writes to Dilthey\nin a more general vein is also applicable to this particular problem: \nThinking moves in circles and the people appear to me like flies\nwhich always bump into the window pane when they try to get out into\nthe open. Someone has got to open the window, but much work and leisure\nis required for\n that.[15] \n\nAccording to Yorck, the characteristics of human psychology and the\neconomy of primary life delimit the course of history, since historical\nlife merely repeats or amplifies the primary stances of consciousness.\nAlthough there is thus a natural ground for history, Yorck is at pains\nto emphasize that the three psychological functions outline\n“possibilities” only, without any inbuilt teleology or\nfixed equilibrium, or a relation to “an unchanging\nordo” as a permanent backdrop for history (ST, p. 4).\nAgainst such approximations of history to nature, Yorck argues for a\nthoroughly historical conception of the historical: “History has\nnothing of the isolation [Selbständigkeit] of the natural\n[order]” (ST, p. 6), but rather, in each of its phases, history is\nself-reflexively involved in its own historicity—“as the\nferment of its aliveness”—and thus opens itself to the\never new “historical contrapposto” (ST, p. 6).\nNothing is exempt from historical change. Philosophical categories\nthrough which the world is understood are historical products of life\nand hence inextricably bound up with the historicity of humankind. For\ninstance, Yorck explicitly claims that the category of\n“being” is itself “a result of life” (ST, p. 8).\nThis liberates history from all relation to an unchanging, fixed point\nof reference outside historical\n life.[16] \nAlthough Yorck provides only an unfinished sketch of the empirical\ncourse of the history of life, he marks three decisive turning-points:\n(1) The breakthrough to philosophy and science on the basis of the\ndominant stance of the psychological function of representation or\ncognition, primarily in ancient Greece and India; (2) the predominance\nof willing in the Roman and Jewish stance towards the world; and (3)\nthe focal centrality of feeling and interiority in Christianity,\nparticular in the Reformation, i.e., Luther. Somewhat like Hegel, Yorck\nholds that history unfolds through particular primary stances towards\nlife which then become dominant in particular\nhistorical\n peoples.[17] \n\nAccording to Yorck, in Ancient Greece consciousness displayed a\nparticular configuration of the primacy of cognition. For the Greeks,\nthe stance of consciousness towards the world is pure looking. It is\nthrough looking that reality is understood. Affectivity (feeling) and\nvolition are not countenanced as functions that disclose the world\nas\n such.[18]\nTruth lies in the\nbeholding eye alone; contemplation, theoria, and intuition\ntake centre stage. It is as if the clear-sighted eye is\nexpressed in words. On the basis of this condition of consciousness,\nthe function of looking [Anschauung], ocularity\n[Okularität], becomes the organ of all free work of the\nmind, particularly of philosophy. (ST, p. 30)  Yorck finds evidence\nfor the prevalence of ocularity or the aesthetic attitude, which is\ncentred on plasticity [Gestaltlichkeit], in Homer, Pythagoras,\nPlato, and Aristotle, among others. Form and content constitute\nthe aesthetic dichotomy which governs Greek thought in its entirety,\nthe result of the liberation of ocularity from all other sensuality,\nthe aesthetic liberation, which strikes a chord in everyone who has\nentered the threshold of Greek life. Looking is the essential\ncomportment; hence, Gestalt or Form [qualifies as] ousia\nor\n substance.[19]\n(ST, p. 31) \nThat Greek metaphysics seeks the unchangeable and impassable is the\nresult of the relative suppression of feeling and willing that is\nlatent in all cognition, which abstracts from feeling and temporality,\nas well as objects of human desire (ST, p. 42). Put differently, the\nstructural timelessness of thought as such is intensified in\nmetaphysical thought where it becomes “absolute” (ST, p. 42).\nYorck emphasizes that “negation of temporality” marks\n“the decisive metaphysical step” (ST, p. 66). Metaphysics\nconstitutes the counter-move against the feeling of temporality (that\neverything passes away), as well as the liberation from the dependence\non objects desired by the will. According to Yorck, the escape from\ntemporality and attachment determines the entire metaphysical tradition\nup to and including Hegel (because even Hegel “ontologizes”\nlife) (ST, p. 83).  \n\nThe breakthrough to a form of life predominantly lived through\nstriving and volition is, according to Yorck, characteristic of the\nJewish and Roman world. Concerning the former, Yorck writes: \nWhereas the Greek, metaphysical cast of mind abstracts from\ntemporality, temporality is the determining element [in the Hebrew\nworld], as the non-aesthetic character of the Jewish way of thought is\nalready expressed in Genesis where time takes precedence over\nspace. Yet the moment of time is here placed in some metaphysical\ndistance, is, as it were, projected into the future, the realization of\nwhich is the prerogative of God. Thus, the stance of consciousness is\none of hope. The messiah, who does not fulfil the law, but, rather,\ndelivers on the promise, is hoped for. (ST, p. 20)  Thus, the\nfeeling of time is here aligned with volition and its projective\nexteriorization. Relative to the Greek contemplation of the everlasting\npresence of the cosmos, the intensive expectation of the future reality\nin the Jewish world is “a-cosmic.” Comparing the Greek to\nthe Jewish world, Yorck writes: Here, contemplative, eternal\npresence; there, intense hope for an invisible futurity. Here,\nknowledge and science; there, coupled with a radical devaluation of the\nobject of knowledge, faith as personally grown postulate. Here,\npleasant expansion and the fullness of existing objectivity; there,\nformless energy directed at the reality anticipated. (ST, p. 22) \nThe unfinished character of Yorck's manuscript is apparent\nespecially in these passages, for there is no further exploration or\nexposition of the Jewish world (let alone anything like a justification\nfor the juxtaposition of the Jewish world with the Roman period).\nYorck's comments concerning the Roman world are likewise very\nsketchy at best. Although Yorck positions the Romans as a\nworld-historical people of the will, he does not do much more than to\nrefer to the popular notion of the “imperialist drive of the\nRomans” (ST, p. 30). Once, in a letter to Dilthey, Yorck emphasizes\nthat the Roman pursuit of power locks life into pure immanence, without\ntemporality and transcendence: “Might is everything,” he\nwrites (CR, p. 120). Yorck continues by contending that the proverbial\nepithet of Rome as the “Eternal City” is by no means a mere\nsaying. Rather, for Yorck, it captures something of the ostentatious\ndisplay of Rome's imperial power—its splendid oblivion of\ntime. Yorck writes: “Rome does not, just as no Roman ever does,\ncomprehend—death” (CR, p. 120). By way of historical\ncontraposition, Yorck then describes, in the same letter, the\n“mute, simple crosses” scratched into the walls of the\nunderground Carcere Mamertino by imprisoned early\nChristians. Yorck characterizes these crosses as “light-points on\nthe underground sky [of the prison], signs of the transcendence of\nconsciousness” (CR, p. 120). The immanence of a life lived for power\nand might is contrasted with the interiority of a conscious feeling of\ntranscendence.  \n\nFor Yorck, the Christian life is the breakthrough to a fully\nhistorical life. Unencumbered by the projection of objective knowledge\n(Greek metaphysics and ocularity) and freed from the expectation of a\nmessiah (hope for the promised future), the Christian lives the\ntemporality of “absolute aliveness” [absolute\nLebendigkeit] in the depths of inwardness\nor\n interiority[20]\n(ST, p. 4). Since\nChristian consciousness has its dominant focus in interiority and\nfeeling, it is free from the cognitive and volitional bonds to any\nobjectivity, but free for the rhythm of temporality and history. The\nChristian “freedom from the world”\n[Weltfreiheit] (ST, p. 81) is at the same time\nfreedom for history and transcendence, i.e., the\nworld-transcendent God, and the personal, felt relationship to him,\nwhich is based on the personal responsibility for one's\nhistorical life before God. Yorck writes: Through Christianity\nan essentially transcendent stance of consciousness is achieved, namely\nby way of the basic factor of feeling. This is a transcendent stance,\nin contradistinction to a metaphysical\n one,[21]\nbecause feeling [Gefühl]—the\nfocal point of aliveness [Lebendigkeit]—is here turned\ninwards, even turned against itself and hence free of all givenness\n[Gegebenheit]. (ST, pp. 13/14)  The release from cognitive\nand volitional projection facilitates an inversion of life's\ntendency; it leaves behind the goals of “certainty and\nsecurity” (CR, p. 143) and grounds life in the personal and\nintrinsically historical relationship to God. \nOn the one hand, Yorck emphasizes the absolute focus on inner life and\nindividual conscience, and the entirely unpredictable and historical\nrelationship to God, this side of all objective worldly realities and\npublic\n opinion.[22]\nThe\nindividual person is singled out in his relationship to God. On the\nother hand, Yorck also holds that the Christian inversion of the\nprojective tendency of life ultimately results in\n“self-renunciation” [Selbstaufgabe],\nwhich expresses the religious pole, opposite to ethical\nself-affirmation through philosophy and science. But precisely through\nthis self-renunciation, life is lived as life, instead of\nbeing lost in the preoccupation with that which is merely intended\nthrough life—the objectively known and desired world. With\nreference to Matthew (10:39), Yorck writes: He who\nfinds his life, will lose it, he who loses it, will find it. This word\nof the Lord describes the law of life itself, the basic condition of\nall life. Death is a mark of life and the radical transcendence of the\ndeepest, the Christian standpoint postulates life as a mark of\ndeath. (ST, p. 58)  Yorck's well-known love for paradox here\nhas its definitive\n origin.[23] \n\nFreed from the bonds to objective representation and the objective\nworld, Christian religion realizes the most concentrated or enhanced\nform of living life as life; it is “supreme\naliveness” [höchste Lebendigkeit] and thus supreme\nhistoricity (ST, p. 104; CR, p. 154). The Christian life is not\ndistracted by the aims of cognition (objectivity) or the ties to\nobjects of desire within the world (in the past, present, or\nfuture). Accordingly, Yorck holds that the historical\n“origin” and “supreme” manifestation of\nlife—fully lived as historical life—lies in\nChristianity. \n\nIn his Einleitung in die Geisteswissenschaften (1883),\nDilthey had made a similar, but by no means identical, point, arguing\nthat “historical consciousness” first came into existence\nthrough the Christian freedom from the outer world (the cosmos) and\nthe newfound centre of life in inwardness (Dilthey 1959, p. 254).\nDilthey writes: \nFor the Greek mind,\nknowledge was the depiction [Abbilden] of something objective,\n[given] to intelligence. Now [after the emergence of Christianity],\nlived experience [Erlebnis] becomes the centre point of all\ninterests for the new communities; but this is nothing other than the\nsimple, inner awareness [Innewerden] of what is given to the\nperson in\nself-consciousness. (Dilthey 1959, p. 251)\n \nYet Dilthey sees this as the first potential\nbreakthrough to a new science, the science of inner experience and the\nhistorical disciplines, the Humanities or\nGeisteswissenschaften. According to Dilthey, Augustine's\nfateful dependence on Greek conceptuality made it impossible to fully\narticulate the new Christian sense of inwardness and history (Dilthey\n1959, p. 264).  Only through the work of Schleiermacher and Kant has\nthere been progress in articulating the original Christian insight\ninto inwardness and historicity of life (Dilthey 1959, p. 267).  Not\nonly does Dilthey fully accept that the meaning of the original\nChristian experience is thus adequately comprehended and harnessed for\nthe understanding, but he also sees his own work on the logic of the\nhistorical sciences as a continuation and fulfilment of this same\nproject. \n\nBy contrast, Yorck eschews all cooptation of the Christian\nbreakthrough to supreme historical aliveness and historicity for the\nestablishment of a science, fearing that this would not only\nconceptualize life as something “ontic,” always present and\navailable for the understanding, but also ignore the vital\nconsciousness of transcendence, or bury it in a\nnew\n scholasticism.[24]\nYorck, who\nalways regarded Luther's work as the vital re-affirmation of the\nearly Christian historical life, suggests, therefore, that instead of\nKant and Schleiermacher, a return to Luther's conception of life\nis the more fruitful way of safeguarding and cultivating the\nbreakthrough to historical life. Acknowledging this difference, Yorck\nwrites to Dilthey:  You will not agree when I say that Luther\nshould and must be more topical to the present time than Kant, if this\npresent time is to have a historical future [historische\nZukunft].
