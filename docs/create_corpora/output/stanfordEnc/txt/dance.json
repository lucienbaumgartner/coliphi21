Is interdisciplinary philosophy that incorporates not\njust insights from other fields but their methods, commitments, and\nforms of discourse still “philosophy”? This article\nassumes that it is, holding that a philosophy of something\ncan make recourse to conversations and practices in all the domains\nthat are relevant to what it is of (in this case dance) so long as\ndoing so aids our thinking about the meaning of that domain.\n“Philosophy” is thus construed broadly here in keeping\nwith how the term is used in the rapidly growing field of the\nphilosophy of dance. The potential for dance philosophy is enormous,\nin part because dance itself is multifaceted enough to make it connect\nwith many branches of philosophy. Indeed, dance has been practiced\nthroughout history for artistic, educational, therapeutic, social,\npolitical, religious and other purposes. There are also types of dance\non the margins of what many would consider dance proper, such as\ndigital dance, or types of competition dance that have features that\nmake them similar to aesthetic sports like gymnastics or figure\nskating, so what counts as “dance” is at issue in some\ncases as well.\n\n\nOf course, philosophical approaches (once these are identified)\nprovide just some of the many ways to approach dance in order to\nbetter understand what it is and why it matters to us. There are\ntheories and insights offered by dance cultural theorists,\nsociologists, historians, educators, anthropologists, ethnographers,\npractitioners, dance critics, evolutionary biologists, cognitive\nscientists, psychologists and others, for example, that are relevant\nto the questions asked by philosophers but which rely primarily on the\nmethods of analysis culled from those fields. The field known as\n“dance studies” typically makes use of cultural studies\nand history but often also includes one or more of the perspectives\nabove, including all forms of philosophy (particularly applied and\nphenomenology). Recently the Congress on Research in Dance and the\nSociety of Dance History Scholars merged to form the Dance Studies\nAssociation (see Franko 2014a for more on the field of dance studies).\nDance studies research journals and books often provide good resources\nfor academic philosophy and yet often philosophy students neglect to\nconsult them, sometimes due to ignorance and sometimes due to a fear\nthat they might learn to handle dance\n“non-philosophically” while they are being trained in\ntraditional philosophic methods. This, among other things, has led to\nthe misperception by some scholars that the field of dance philosophy\nis smaller than it in fact is.\n\n\nAn additional difficulty is that since the research domain of dance\nstudies is more thoroughly interdisciplinary, and sometimes\ntransdisciplinary, than that of those of us working under the\nconstraints of philosophy departments and their research guidelines\n(where tenure is dependent on publishing in traditional philosophy\njournals, for example) it is not always easy to identify the\nphilosophy and philosophy-relevant discourses within it. Indeed, it is\noften the case that dance philosophers who are multi-methodological,\nnotably Sondra Horton Fraleigh and Maxine Sheets-Johnstone, have rich\nphilosophical insights that are erroneously overlooked or\nmisunderstood, especially in those places where their writing deviates\nfrom that of traditional philosophy (see also Erin Manning’s\nprocess philosophy [2013]). It is also the case that some scholars who\nwork in dance rather than philosophy departments, like Anna Pakes, an\nanalytic dance philosopher, do adhere to the disciplinary boundaries\nof academic philosophy and yet their work that is published in dance\nstudies rather than philosophy books and journals can pass by\nunnoticed. \n\n\nPhilosophy students and others who are interested in dance philosophy\nare advised to take note of these research-relevant conditions and to\nconsider the meta-philosophical question of both methodology and focus\non inquiry when determining how they will write their own work and\nevaluate that of others. Analytic aesthetics philosophers, for\nexample, might want to know what the “work” of dance as\nart is and this may not be a question of relevance to the continental,\npragmatic, process or dance-studies integrated philosopher. Similarly,\naccounts of dance that focus heavily on the lived experience of dance\nfor dance-makers and performers that answers to the truth of that\nexperience for dance practitioners may be of interest to performance\nphilosophers, pragmatists and phenomenological philosophers but may\nnot be accepted as relevant by those analytic philosophers who are\ninterested in the critical-appreciative stance.\n\n\nThese methodological choices by dance philosophers reflect normative\nas well as epistemic commitments (cf. McFee 2018 for another account\nof dance philosophy normativity). Issues of social power, oppression,\nand silencing of viewpoints, for example, may be of interest and\nconcern to one group of dance philosophers while another group sees\nthese concerns as external to questions that interest them (such as\nwhether a triple pirouette counts as expert action, say). Finally, as\nthe institutional field of philosophy in the U.S. and elsewhere\nexpands to include non-Western and non-traditional sources of\nphilosophy, such as that by philosophers whose viewpoints were\nmarginalized or excluded for a variety of reasons, what\n“counts” as the philosophy of dance will need to expand\nwith it. Noticing which domain or sets of domains or non-domains a\ndance philosopher is working in, which questions interest them, and\nwhat counts as evidence for them can go a long way towards avoiding\nmisunderstandings and inapt criticisms of others’ work. This\npresents both the challenge of the Tower of Babel and the opportunity\nof a truly rich and multi-cultural dance philosophy world. (For more\non the relation between philosophy and dance as well as questions of\ndance philosophy and interdisciplinarity see Boyce 2013 and\nforthcoming; Burt 2009; Carroll 2003; Challis 1999; Cohen 1962;\nColebrook 2005; Conroy 2012; cf. Cull Ó Maoilearca 2018 [this\nfocuses on philosophy and theatre but there are interesting parallels\nwith dance]; Cvejić 2015b; DeFrantz 2005; Redfern 1983; Foster,\nRothfield, and Dunagan 2005; Fraleigh 1999; cf. Franko 2014a [this\ndiscusses dance studies and aesthetics]; Friedman with Bresnahan\nforthcoming; Levin 1983; T. Lewis 2007; McFee 2013a; Pakes 2019;\nSheets-Johnstone 1984; Shusterman 2005; Sparshott 1982a, 1982b, 1983,\n1988, 1993, 1995, 2004; and Van Camp 1996a and 2009.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dance philosophy that is a subset of philosophical aesthetics is\ninterested in the question, “what is the nature of dance as\nart?” Here one set of philosophical problems center on\nidentifying what the art product of dance is—whether it is an\nobject or structure of some or a more fluid process or event. Dance\nphilosophers differ on which features of dance as art should have\nprimary of place for purposes of ontology. Some philosophers with\ncommitments to dancework structure and repeatability (notably Nelson\nGoodman (1976) and Graham McFee (1992b, 2011b, and 2018)) treat the\nart-relevant aspect of dance as its abstract structure, looking to an\nactual or in-principle score for guidance even if they deny (as McFee\ndoes) that this is an attempt to find a true definition or\n“essence” of dance. It is important to these philosophers\nthat there be an object of appreciation that can be evaluated\nindependently of any particular subjective experience or perspective\nof it, in this way hoping to identify something “true”\nabout dance as art that is subject to the sort of rational appraisal,\nanalysis, and what McFee calls “reconstruction” that\nanalytic philosophy does well (see McFee 2018). \nThere are dance works of art that are relatively stable throughout\ndance history in terms of historical identification despite variations\n(the perennial Swan Lake, for example) and McFee points to\nthese as support for his perspective on dance as a practice that\ncreates dance works of are that are “performables”\ninstantiated in repeatable performances. There are dance philosophers,\nhowever, who think that the art-relevant focus of dance might lie\nelsewhere than in the structure of the “dancework” treated\nas art object. Mark Franko, for example, points out that  \ncontemporary thought on dance is frequently split between a concept of\ndance-as-writing and a concept of dance as beyond the grasp of all\nlanguage, especially written language. (2011a: 322; see also Franko\n2011b)  \n(For more on the idea of dance as texts see Franko 1993.) Other dance\nphilosophers think that dance can be characterized by words and\nconcepts but that these either apply to features of performance or to\ndance practices or events rather than to texts or structures. The\nnon-structuralist dance philosophers observe that dances usually lack\nwords or texts and are often developed without the use of a written\nplan, script or score of any kind (see Franko 1989 and 2011a; see also\nFranko 2017 for a recent anthology of dance and reconstruction, in\nparticular the essay by Pakes [2017b] within it). They also note that\neven when there is a score, this score is not always used as an\nessential recipe for the performances but can instead just serve as\nthe inspiration for a performance that is completely different (see\nFranko 1989). In addition, standardized notation forms are\ncontroversial, and no one form is universally accepted (see Franko\n2011a and Van Camp 1998). Finally, there are dance philosophers who\nthink that what makes dance special and worthy of philosophers’\ninterest lies in dance’s bodily, tactile, dynamic, felt,\nperceived and intuited aspects (sometimes referred to as its\nkinaesthetic or somatic elements). (See this entry’s\n Sections 2 and 3\n for more on these latter aspects of dance. See\n Sections 1.1–1.2\n  below for more on focus\non dance’s structural vs. non-structural features. See also\nPakes 2006 for one account of the “mind-body” problem in\ndance.) \nFor more on the general question, “What is dance?”, see D.\nCarr 1987; Carroll 2003, Copeland and Cohen 1983; McFee 1998a and\n2013a; Pakes 2019; Sparshott 1988; and Van Camp 1981. For more on\nmeaning, expression, authenticity and communication in dance see D.\nCarr 1997; Best 1974; Franko 2014b; Hanna 1983 and 1979 [1987]; Martin\n1933a, 1939, and 1946; and Van Camp 1996b. \nAs mentioned briefly in the section above, there are many problems of\nidentity for dance that arise in analytic aesthetics (cf. Fraleigh\n2004 for an alternative usage of the word “identity” for\ndance). One is that the moment that a dance is composed does not\n“fix” the dance for all time in that form. Dances are\nusually known by the name and date of their first performance but\nsubsequent performances and casts can change the structural and other\nqualitative features that were present in the original performance.\nFurther, as mentioned earlier, many dances have no notated score and,\nif they are preserved via video or other method, subsequent\nperformances can still deviate from these frameworks in significant\nand perhaps identity-changing ways. In addition, even where there is a\nscore, it may not result in performances from that score that are\nexperientially identifiable as the “same” work of art. A\ndance notation might also function as the jumping-off point from which\nto make a radically new kind of dance rather than a limitation on\ninnovation and changes to which a dance choreographer or set of\nperformers must adhere. There is also the issue that what a dance\n“is” in practice or for appreciation, in its\n“essential” features (if there are any), may not be\nidentical with what a dance “is” for purposes of numerical\nidentity and historical preservation. In this way dance is not unlike\nmusic (for more on this S. Davies 1991). (See Armelagos and Sirridge\n1978; D. Davies 2011b; Goodman 1976; McFee 2011b and 2018 for more on\nthis particular debate. Cf. S. Davies 1991 for a relevant discussion\nin the philosophy of music and Meskin 1999 for an alternative view of\ndancework ontology that holds that dance audiences experience\nthree works of art: 1) a choreographic-work, 2) a\nproduction-work, and 3) a performance-interpretation work.) \nFor more on the question of “What is Dance?” see D. Carr\n1997; Cohen 1982; Conroy 2015 (who provides an account of dance as\ngestural fiction); McFee 1994 and 1998a; Rubidge 2000; Sparshott 1988\nand 1995; Thomas 2018; and Van Camp 1981. \nOne of the features of dance as a performing art that has been often\nnoted is that it moves and it changes, both during the course of any\ngiven performance and over time. A catchall phrase for this sort of\nimpermanence—reflecting the lack of entirely stable art\n“objects” in every case—has been to say that\n“dance is an ephemeral art”, although there are\nalternative versions of what this means (see Conroy 2012; see also\nCopeland and Cohen 1983 and Copeland 1993. This does not mean that\ndance is insubstantial or unserious. Instead, what it means is that\nthere is something vital about dance performances and events that\ndisappears as it is being performed. As noted in\n Section 3,\n above, this may or may not distinguish dance from theater or music,\nalthough dance does seem to rely less on recordings and written\nnotations in the making and performing of dances overall. \nDance critic Marcia Siegel famously wrote that dance “exists as\na perpetual vanishing point”, which means for Siegel that dance\nexists in “an event that disappears in the very act of\nmaterializing.” (1972: 1). Siegel posits that dance has escaped\nthe mass marketing of the industrial revolution “precisely\nbecause it doesn’t lend itself to any\nreproduction…” (1972: 5). Conroy (2012: 158) acknowledges\nthat the “safest” ontological interpretation of\nSiegel’s claim would suggest that dance performances are\none-time, transient events. If this is the case it would mean that\nthere is no enduring “type” that constitutes a dance work\nof art that is “tokened” by various instancing\nperformances. This would mean that the “classical\nparadigm” discussed by D. Davies (2011b) and upheld by Goodman\n(1976) and by McFee (2011b and 2018) is wrong. If we hold that\nsome dance performances are transient but not others, then\nthe classical paradigm would still need to account for those\nperformances that do not fit, much like the ontology of music has had\nto deal with the ontology of highly or entirely improvised jazz\nperformances that seem to be “one-offs” and that are not\npreserved via recording. (See Anna Pakes’ forthcoming book,\nChoreography Invisible: The Disappearing Work of Dance, for\nmore on this issue.) \nMcFee (2011b; also see 2018) believes that the instability of dance\nworks of art is a problem that is due to poor preservation and\nreconstruction of dances rather than a feature that tells us something\nmeaningful about the nature of dance. He also thinks that dance\nnotation might be developed in the future to provide a workable way to\npreserve and reconstruct dances, something that Van Camp and Franko\nsuggest may not be possible (the specifics of their claims here can be\nfound in\n Section 2\n of this entry, above). We can take this to be the negative view of\nthe ephemerality of dance. \nA positive version of dance as an ephemeral art, however, is one that\nholds that we ought to appreciate, rather than decry, dance’s\never-changing and disappearing nature as something that makes a live\nperformance of a dance that will not happen again the same way into a\nvital experience for both the dance performers and the audience. The\npositive account celebrates the live nature of the dance performance\nand helps to explain why kinesthetic responses to dance performances\nare both relevant and powerful. It also suggests that ephemerality is\nan aesthetic value for dance that gives dance the ability to provide a\n“you had to be there” sort of event. (See Bresnahan 2014a\nfor an account of improvisational artistry in live dance performance\nas a sort of agency that is consistent with this positive view.)\nConroy agrees with McFee that the phrase “dance is an ephemeral\nart” does apply to the difficulty of preserving dances, but she\nalso thinks it should be conceived as a statement of a danceworld\nvalue; as a way of conveying “a communal attitude of tolerance\nfor change with respect to choreography that has been previously\nperformed” (2012: 160). \nAs mentioned in the introduction to this entry, dance philosophers\nvary in terms of where within dance practice and performance they\nwould like to focus their attention. Many philosophers who focus on\ndance as agency and intentional action are looking at the expert\naction involved in dance as art, although some consider agency and\nintentionality in social or other forms of dance. It is also the case\nthat when considering dance as a form of expert action (akin to\nsports, say) that often technical and athletic prowess as well as\nartistic skills like expressivity or grace are the focus on analysis\n(see, e.g., Montero 2016). Among these are philosophers of art who are\ninterested in questions of dance work identity, for purposes of\nhistorical identification and reconstruction among others. These, like\nMcFee (2018), treat dance-relevant actions as part of what is needed\nto create and instantiate a dance work of art (dancework) with the\nfocus being on the structure created by these actions. (For more on\nMcFee’s account of dance and action see McFee 2011b, 2018 and forthcoming.) \nAnother traditional way, besides those mentioned in\n Section 1,\n that dance philosophers in analytic aesthetics have considered the\nquestion “what is dance?” is to characterize dance as a\nparticularly expressive form of art, or one that involves\n“action” in a particular way. Dance historian Selma Jean\nCohen (1962) has held that expressiveness is present in all dance, for\nexample, causing Monroe C. Beardsley (1982) to posit that\nexpressiveness might be a necessary if not sufficient condition for\ndance as art. Borrowing from action theory, Beardsley says that one\nbodily action can, under the right circumstances, be sortally\ngenerated into another kind of action. Thus, the act of running, can,\nunder the right circumstances, be expressive and part of the art of\ndance accordingly. We can also infer here that other conditions of\ndance as art might also apply (being on a stage in a theater, being\noffered for appreciation as a dance, conducted in ways that are part\nof a dance vocabulary, etc.). In making this claim, Beardsley rejects\nHaig Khatchadourian’s view (1978) that dance movements are not\nactions, crediting Van Camp’s Philosophical Problems of\nDance Criticism (1981) for helping him to critique Khatchadourian\nin this way. (See Meskin 1999 for more on dances as action sequences\nrather than mere movements; See Carroll and Banes 1982 for a critique\nof Beardsley’s theory of dance as expressive action.) \nSusanne K. Langer (1953b) holds that dance is an art that is in\nessence a symbol-making endeavor but she does not call this activity\n“action.” For Langer dance’s products are symbols\nbut these are a sort of coalescence and transforming of real\nactivities into a virtual (“artistic”) form. For Langer,\ndance’s special symbol or “primary illusion” is what\nshe calls “virtual power” or gesture rather than virtual\ntime (the symbol for music), virtual space (the symbol for the plastic\narts) or the illusion of life (the symbol for poetry, when it is in\nwords and for drama when it is presented in the mode of action). Thus,\nher view departs from Beardsley’s here significantly. Instead,\nit seems more in line with that of Graham McFee (2018), who holds that\ndance is “embodied meaning.” McFee is presumably following\nArthur C. Danto’s 1981 account of art in The Transfiguration\nof the Commonplace here but since Danto was Langer’s\nstudent she may have been the ultimate genesis of this idea. (For\nMcFee’s view of dance as action see\n Section 2\n of this entry.) \nAnna Pakes’ view of dance as action is in line with that of\nBeardsley and Van Camp, against Khatchadourian and Langer. She (2013)\nagrees that action is a necessary feature of dance. Both Aaron Meskin\n(1999) and Pakes suggest that it is the embodiment of dance in a\nphysical, intentional event that makes dances better construed as\naction-structures than as eternal types. It is for this reason (among\nothers) that they find dance to be ill-suited for analysis under a\nPlatonic ontology of art in which the structure of the work of art is\ndiscovered rather than created. Sondra Horton Fraleigh (1996) can be\nplaced on Pakes and Meskin’s side here, since she holds that\ndance is necessarily expressive and transitive action. \nThere are other contemporary dance philosophers, some working within\nthe analytic tradition and some not, who treat the minded agency and\naction involved in either choreography, performing dance, or both, as\nprimary areas of dance interest as well. Often these are connected to\nnormative, epistemic and ontological commitments about what dance is\nand why it matters (David Davies (2004), for example, treats all art,\nincluding dance art, as performance). Many of these philosophers (such\nas Bresnahan 2014a, 2017a, and 2019b; Merritt 2015; and Montero 2016)\nuse both traditional philosophy, in the forms of analytic philosophy\nand phenomenological philosophy, and insights from research in the\ncognitive sciences as aids in their analysis. (For more on dance\nphilosophy and its connections to cognitive science see\n Section 4.\n See also\n Section 3.3 for a discussion of dance\nas expertise.) \nThere is also a great deal of literature on agency and intentional\naction in dance philosophy, which focuses on the thinking and embodied\nactivities that take place in the studio or on the stage or other\nperformance contexts as well as literature on the agency and\nactivities of audience members or appreciators who are not also\ndancers and dance-makers. (For more dance philosophy literature on\ndance agency and intentional action see D. Carr 1987; J. Carr 2013;\nBunker, Pakes and Rowell 2013; Noland 2009; and Sheets-Johnstone 1981,\n1999, 2011, and 2012.) \nVan Camp (1980) holds that, for purposes of artistic judgment and\nappreciation at least, it is the case that sometimes the dance\nperformer “creates”, and not just performs and interprets,\nthe dance. The dancer, for example, often supplies structural and\nstylistic elements of a dance during the course of rehearsing and\nperforming the piece that were not specified or provided by the\nchoreographer. If these contributions are significant then what the\ndancer provides might be better understood as “creation”\nrather than “interpretation”, she maintains. \nThis view is opposed by McFee (2011b, 2013c and 2018), who believes\nthat dance works of art are created by choreographers and are\nperformed by dancers to fulfill the choreographer’s intentions.\nChris Challis (1999)’s work supports this account. On\nMcFee’s choreographer-as-dancework-author view the\ndancer’s role is both instrumental and subsidiary to the\nchoreographer’s vision and their expertise is in dancing, not in\ndance-art creation. It follows from this that dancers contribute the\nraw material for dance performances but are more like skilled\ntechnicians or artisans than author-artists. This view has been\ncriticized for neglecting the performers’ role in making and\nperforming dances in art-relevant ways by Lauren Alpert in an American\nSociety for Aesthetics conference (2016), by Aili Bresnahan (2013 and\nat a dance philosophy conference at Texas State and in a\nwork on interpretation in dance performing), and by Pakes (2019). (For\nmore on creative decision-making and choreography in dance see\nCvejić 2015a and 2017; Foster 2011; and Melrose 2017. For an\narticle on video choreography see Salzer and Baer 2015. Cf. S. Davies\n1991 for a discussion of whether creative additions to a\n“thin” work of art can “thicken” it.) \nMcFee bolsters this account with his idea that artistic authorship of\ndance works of art is and should be attributable only to those who\nbear “responsibility” for these works (2018). This comes\nclose to and yet stops short of equating dance-making credit for\ndances with intellectual property rights, where it is by no means the\ncase (particularly in the U.S.) that those who create art are the ones\ntaking credit and who are granted legal copyright in them. (For more\non issues of authorship in dance and copyright see Kraut 2010, 2011\nand 2016 and Van Camp 1994. For a book on dance, disability and the\nlaw see Whatley et al. 2018.) \n“Improvisation” in dance often refers to the intentional\nagency and action of dance-makers and performers (who may or may not\nbe the same people) rather than the result of that activity. Three\ntypes of improvisation in theater dance have been identified by Carter\n(2000: 182): 1) embellishments where set choreography persists, 2)\nimprovisation as spontaneous free movement for use in set choreography\nand 3) improvisation for its own sake brought to a high level of\nperformance. An example of 1) would be the situation in which a dance\nperformer is allowed to amplify existing movements (doing a triple\npirouette in place of a double, for example), or a stylistic flourish\nsuch as an extra flick of the wrist or tilt of the head. An example of\n2) would be the case in which no choreography has been provided for\neight bars of music and the dancer(s) is given the freedom to insert\nwhatever he or she wishes in the open space. Finally, 3) would cover\nthe situation that D. Davies (2011b) might call a “work\nperformance”, where a work is choreographed by the dancers while\ndancing. It would also include the situation where either the whole\nperformance or a substantial part of it is improvised from start to\nfinish. Dances comprised of Steve Paxton’s “contact\nimprovisation”, for example, would count as improvisation for\nits own sake (see Paxton 1975 and 1981). \nDanielle Goldman (2010) provides a critical analysis of the idea of\nimprovisational “freedom”, as represented in\nCarter’s improvisation type 2, above. She suggests that we\nexamine social and historical constraints on the possibility of\n“freedom”, since such freedom cannot exist in oppressive\nconditions such as slavery where prohibitive social as well as\nphysical barriers exist. Goldman thus suggests an alternative form of\nimprovisation, one that is  \na rigorous mode of making oneself ready for a range of potential\nsituations…an incessant preparation, grounded in the present\nwhile open to the next moment’s possible actions and\nconstraints. (2010: 142) \nIn “Taken by Surprise: Improvisation in Dance and Mind”,\nSusan Leigh Foster (2003) shares Goldman’s view that it is the\nmoment right before an actual dance movement within a performance that\nmatters to the special aesthetic experience of dance improvisation.\nShe says, “it is this suspense-filled plenitude of the\nnot-quite-known that gives live performance its special\nbrilliance” (2003: 4). Her essay also contains a\nphenomenological account of the agency involved in improvisation,\nequating the lived experience of improvisation with a “middle\nvoice”, in which a dancer finds herself in a flow of movement\nthat takes the middle position between deliberative choices and\npassive direction. \nDance philosophers have also identified other forms of dance\nimprovisation that do not fit within Carter’s three categories.\nKent de Spain (2003), for example, brings our attention to a type of\ndance improvisation that is practiced by dancers in order to achieve a\nmovement-based somatic state, what we shall call “somatic\nimprovisation”. Somatic improvisation, or the results of these\nimprovisational exercises, may be included in a theater performance\nfor an audience but need not be. Constance Valis Hill (2003) includes\n“challenge dance” performances, stemming from the\nAfrican-American tradition of dance “battles”, where the\npurpose is to win an ever-escalating competition of skill and style.\nLike somatic improvisation, challenge dance improvisation can be\noffered for audience appreciation in a concert context but need not\nbe—it has taken place in social and street settings, for\nentertainment as well as for “artistic” purposes. Aili Bresnahan\n(2014a) has made the claim that all live dance performance\ninvolves improvisational artistry to at least some extent and that\nthis can be seen as a kind of embodied and extended agency under\nembodied and extended mind theories, in particular that of Andy Clark\nin his book, Supersizing the Mind: Embodiment, Action, and\nCognitive Extension (2011). \nFor more on improvisation in dance, see Albright and Gere 2003;\nClemente 1990; De Spain 1993, 2014, and 2019; Kloppenberg 2010;\nMatheson 2005; Novack 1990 and 1988 [2010]; Pallant 2006; Paxton 1975\nand 1981; Zaporah 2003; and The Oxford Handbook of Improvisation\nin Dance (Midgelow 2019). For more on improvisation in the arts,\nsee the Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism special issue\non Improvisation in the Arts, Spring, 2000 [Hagberg 2000]; Alperson\n1984, 1998, and 2010; Bresnahan 2015; Brown 1996; Hagberg 1998;\nG. Lewis 2014; the Oxford Handbook of Critical Improvisation\nStudies (2 volumes, Lewis and Piekut 2016/Piekut and Lewis 2016);\nand Sawyer 2000. Cf. Symposium, 2010, “Musical\nImprovisation” in The Journal of Aesthetics and Art\nCriticism. \nThere are fields of philosophy, particularly in the Continental,\npragmatic, and non-Western traditions, that treat art as both activity\nand as experiential phenomena. These phenomenological kinds of\nphilosophy treat lived experience, including bodily and somatic\nexperience, as something that can provide legitimate descriptive or\ncausal evidence for philosophic claims. (See, e.g., Dewey 1934;\nMerleau-Ponty 1945 and 1964; along with Berleant 1991; Bresnahan\n2014b; \n Foultier and Roos 2013 (Other Internet Resources); \n Johnson 2007; Katan 2016; Lakoff and\nJohnson 1999; and Merritt 2015 for work on dance following Dewey and\nMerleau-Ponty. For more on phenomenological approaches to dance see\nAlbright 2011; Fraleigh 1996 [which also contains quite a lot of\nmaterial on the history of dance in aesthetics], 2000, and 2018;\nFranko 2011b; and Sheets-Johnstone 1966 and 2015. Cf. Ness 2011 for an\naccount of a shift in dance away from phenomenology with\nFoucault.) \nRichard Shusterman has developed his own phenomenological theory,\nwhich he calls “somaesthetics”, in order to explain an\nembodied engagement with art, including dance, that includes a sort of\nkinesthetic awareness of interior, somatic processes (see 2008, 2009,\n2011a, 2011b, 2011c and 2012). (For more on dance and somatic\nengagement see Eddy 2002; Fraleigh 2015; Weber 2019; and Williamson et\nal. 2014. See also LaMothe 2009; Pakes 2003, 2017a, and 2019; and\nParvainen 2002 for work on the related field of dance, the body and\nepistemology.) \nThose philosophers, some of whom are mentioned above, who treat lived\nexperience as legitimate descriptive and explanatory evidence are\nfirmly committed to the validity of practice in philosophy of dance.\nAnalytic aesthetics philosophers, however (such as D. Davies and\nMontero), often find it necessarily to legitimize their recourse to\npractice in an explicit way. D. Davies’ view is that ontologies\nof art should operate under a “pragmatic constraint” that\ntethers their views to what can be demonstrated in practice (2009).\nMontero’s is that there is empirical evidence to support the\nidea that practitioners are experts in their domain of practice (see\n2012, 2013, and 2016). \nJulie Van Camp and Renee Conroy have argued that analytic dance\naesthetics needs to be more reflective of and responsive to actual\ndanceworld and artworld practice. Van Camp has proposed  \nthat the identity of works of art [including dance] be understood\npragmatically as ways of talking and acting by the various communities\nof the art world. (2006: 42)  \nConroy (2013b) has instead of a definition provided an argument for\nwhat she calls three “minimal desiderata” for an adequate\naccount of dancework identity, two of which require that any theory be\nresponsive to and applicable in danceworld practice, and one that\nrequires that criteria of metaphysical adequacy be met. (For an\naccount of practice as dance research see Pakes 2003 and 2017a.) \nIn dance philosophy there is controversy about how to construe the\nfelt, bodily responses that the audience can and often does have while\nwatching a dance performance. These felt, bodily responses are often\ncalled “kinaesthetic”, with the alternate spelling of\n“kinesthetic” (combining the movement sense of\n“kinetic” with a physical sort of sense of the aesthetic\nas beautiful, or graceful and the like) and the mechanism by which\nthese responses occur is one of the things that is debated. Two of the\nquestions that arise here are the following: 1) What is the causal\nprocess by which kinesthetic responses are felt? and 2) To what\nextent, if any, does an understanding of this causal process inform a\nproper understanding of dance qua dance as art? \nTo take the first question first: Causal processes that can explain\nkinesthetic responses in dance are by no means well understood. It is\nnot clear, for example, how “empathy”, understood in the\nbroad sense as the ability to feel something based on what we perceive\nas someone else’s experience, like a dance performer’s,\ninforms our kinaesthetic and other appreciative responses. (For more\non empathy and the kinaesthetic aspect of performance see Foster 2008\nand 2011.) \nSome contemporary philosophers of dance such as Barbara Montero\n(2006a, 2006b, 2012, and 2013) use research in cognitive science and\nin neuroscience in order to ascertain the answers to why audience\nmembers report feeling kinesthetic responses such as a quickening\nheart rate and certain tensions along with more mysterious feelings in\ntheir muscles and nervous systems. (For more on how dance philosophy\nincorporates approaches from cognitive science in these and other\nareas see\n Section 4,\n below. See also Bresnahan 2017b; Reason and Reynolds 2010; Sklar\n2008; and Smyth 1984 for more on kinaesthetic response to dance.) \nMontero’s view (2012) is that trained dancers have enhanced and\nmore nuanced kinaesthetic responses than do persons with no dance\ntraining, something that she believes can contribute to a richer\nappreciative evaluation of dance (see Bresnahan 2017b for a fuller\ndiscussion of this view). Conroy agrees that Montero’s evidence\nshows that trained dancers might be able “to identify subtle\ndiscrepancies between multiple performances of canonical movement\ntypes” but denies that this necessarily translates into better\nappreciation of dance qua dance as art, where what matters is\nappreciation of aesthetic properties which may or may not\ndepend on the kind of perception Montero’s evidence identifies\nin every case (2013: 205). McFee, as mentioned in\n Section 3.2,\n disagrees that dance training is ever relevant to the understanding\nof dance as art, which he seems to equate with critical appreciation.\nVan Camp (2019) lends support for this view.\n \nBresnahan has sided with Montero on this point (2017b). This is due to\nBresnahan’s pragmatic perspective that the art-determining features of\n“art” lie in the experience of art, both as an appreciator\nand as a dancer and practitioner. Further, Bresnahan believes that\nthere are some aspects of the experience of dance that are not\navailable to the non-dance-trained appreciator or not available to the\nsame extent. Bresnahan agrees that this is an empirical question but\nshe sides with Montero, Carroll and Seeley in holding that answers to\nempirical questions can aid philosophic understanding. (For more\ndiscussion on the appropriateness of empirical support for philosophic\ninquiry in dance see\n Sections 3.2\n and\n 4\n of this entry. See He and Ravn 2018; Melrose 2017; Montero 2010,\n2012, and 2013; Vass-Rhee 2018; and Washburn et al. 2014 for more on\ndance and expertise.) \nThe number of dance philosophers who are interested and involved in\nusing empirical research in the cognitive sciences to help our\nunderstanding of the cognitive-physical components of making dance art\nin actions, events and performances is large and growing. These\ninclude Bläsing et al. 2012 and Bläsing et al. 2019;\nBresnahan 2014a; Cross and Ticini 2012; Hagendoorn 2012; Katan 2016;\nJang and Pollick 2011; He and Ravn 2018; Jola, Ehrenberg, and Reynolds\n2012; Legrand and Ravn 2009; McKechnie and Stevens 2009; Merritt 2015;\nMontero 2006a, 2006b, 2010, 2012, and 2013; Seeley 2011 and 2013;\nVass-Rhee 2018. Maxine Sheets-Johnstone’s body of dance\nphilosophy work that incorporates research from the cognitive and\nother sciences is so extensive that they would require their own entry\nto list in full (see the ones in this entry’s bibliography for a\nstart). See Bresnahan 2017a for an account of how dance training\naffects our temporal experience and Bresnahan 2019a for the view that\nexpert dance movements are often experienced and perceived via\nsubconscious processes before they are fully cognized. For a series of\nsustained arguments against the philosophical fruitfulness of using\ninsights from cognitive science see McFee 2003, 2011a, and 2018. \nMontero has written on how proprioception (the capacity that lets a\nperson know their bodily position in space) might be construed as an\naesthetic sense, how mirror neurons might be part of an audience\nexperience of this sense, and how trained dancers might make better\naesthetic judges at least in part due to some of these mechanisms.\n(See the discussion on expertise that precedes this discussion in\n Section 3.3.)\n Carroll is one philosopher who has followed Montero’s research\n(see Carroll and Moore 2011) in his thinking about how dance and music\nmight work together to affect our kinaesthetic responses. He has also\nconsidered (see Carroll and Seeley 2013) how Montero’s research\nand other research in neuroscience might bolster dance critic John\nMartin’s theory of “metakinetic transfer” from dance\nperformers to audience dances. (For more on Martin’s theory of\n“metakinetic transfer”, which he says is due to\n“muscular sympathy” and “inner mimicry” see\nMartin 1939 and Franko 1996.) \nThe philosophers who support the use of research on neurological\nprocessing of kinesthetic responses to dance in general hold that it\nis relevant to our proper understanding of dance qua the art\nof dance. Carroll and Seeley (2013) argue, for example, that one of\nthe central features of understanding dance is to understand the\nnature of the experience of dance in all its aspects, cognitive as\nwell as kinesthetic and felt. Thus, connecting this\nexperience with causal explanations is elucidating and appropriate to\na full and broad understanding of that experience in all of\nits aspects. This can be called the “moderately optimistic\nview”, following D. Davies 2013. D. Davies’ own answer to\nthe question of how scientific research can be used in understanding\nand appreciating dance is what he calls the “moderately\npessimistic” view (2013). He agrees with McFee that there are\nsome questions relevant to philosophical dance aesthetics that cannot\nbe answered by empirical research, no matter how accurate that\nresearch may be for answering certain scientific, causal questions.\nThere are normative questions, for example, such as “what counts\nas proper appreciation of a work of art?” that science cannot\nanswer. Empirical research, where used by dance and other\nphilosophers, must, according to D. Davies, be applied carefully to\nthe relevant questions (see 2011a and 2013; see also 2014). \nD. Davies (2013) is only moderately pessimistic about empirical\nresearch, however, because he thinks that philosophy ought not to\npartition itself away from science and away from other disciplines\nthat might inform our thinking. Here he suggests that we ought to\nfollow the Quinean idea that philosophy ought to respond to and at\nleast be cognizant of current science so that we know how our\nphilosophic views fit into our web of other beliefs about the world.\nD. Davies (2013) is also sympathetic with the part of Seeley’s\nview (in Seeley 2011) that holds that empirical research can at least\nhelp us to avoid false assumptions pertaining to the arts that are\ntacitly or explicitly based on empirical misunderstandings. (For a\nfull discussion of the various optimisms and pessimisms regarding how\nempirical research can affect our understanding of art here see Bullot\net al. 2017.) \nMcFee (2011a, 2013b and 2018) denies that causal explanations about\nkinesthetic responses are ever relevant to dance appreciation. This\nview can be called (following D. Davies 2013) “the extremely\npessimistic view”. McFee holds that causal accounts,\nparticularly from the sciences, of the appreciation and experience of\ndance, either in terms of kinesthetic responses or anything else,\nare never relevant to understanding dance as art. He says\nthat the idea that “our bodily reactions—our toe-tapping,\nsitting up straight, holding our breaths, tensing our legs, and so\non” is relevant to dance appreciation “makes no\nsense” (2013b: 189, a view reinforced in 2018). His thought here\nis that dance appreciation happens at the level of a person\nwho appreciates, someone with the cultural resources to understand\ndance as a form of art, not at the level of neurobiology. Montero,\nCarroll and Seeley would probably agree that kinesthetic responses\ncannot alone provide an appreciation of dance as art. The difference\nis that, unlike McFee, they think that neurobiologic studies can\ncontribute to our understanding of dance as art in some ways. (For\nmore on McFee’s view here see McFee 2003, 2013b, and 2018. For\nanother neuroscientific approach to audience engagement with dance see\nSeeley 2013.) \nThis section is last and is sparse for the reasons mentioned in the\nintroduction. The reader is encouraged to seek out sources beyond the\nfew ones mentioned here and to look in the ancillary locations\nrecommended within each section for additional information, along with\ndoing searches in dance and performance studies journals. (See the\nentries in the\n Related Entries section\n below.) \nHere the reader is encouraged to consult sources that may not be\ncalled “philosophy” but something else, such as religious\nstudies, ethnography, cultural anthropology, oral history, and the\nlike, particularly in those traditions where philosophy and religious\nscholarship combines (as in Islamic philosophy and some forms of East\nAsian and Indian philosophy) or where the traditions of thought are\ncommunicated orally rather than in writing (as is often the case in\nthe philosophy of native and indigenous peoples). There is also much\nof philosophy of dance interest to be found in the literature, poetry,\nand song of groups and peoples who are not a traditionally\nenfranchised part of the Western philosophical canon. \nThe bibliographic sources provided here on non-Western and\nnon-traditional philosophy and/or non-Western forms of dance include\nS. Davies (2006, 2008, 2012, and 2017) on Balinese Legong, Fraleigh\n(2010 and 2015) on the Japanese form of dance known as Butoh,\nincluding asking whether Butoh is a philosophy, Friedman’s\nforthcoming essay on post-colonial African philosophical frameworks as\napplied to dance, Hall 2012 on Fanon’s view of dance, Osumare\n2007 on Africanist aesthetics and hip-hop, Schroeder 2009 on Nietzsche\nand the Kyoto school, Welch 2019 on Native American dance and the\nphenomenology of performative knowledge, and Welsh-Asante 1990, who\nhas published a piece on Cabral, Fanon and dance in Africa. See also\n Section 5.2\n below, particularly for Western non-traditional philosophy, some of\nwhich is critical work that has been placed under the social-political\ncategory. \nHere the reader is encouraged to consult ethics, social and political\nphilosophy journals as well as those journals that highlight cultural\nand critical studies (such as gender, race, disability, ethnicity,\nLGBTQ+ and others), along with dance studies and dance history\njournals and books. For a subject-related entry that discusses the\ninfluence of post-structuralism and politics on dance philosophy see\nPakes 2019. (Cf. Cull Ó Maoilearca 2012 for a Deleuzean account\nof the ethics of performance that might apply to dance.) \nAdditional sources one might consult here include Fiona Bannon’s\nbook (2018) and dance and ethics, which among other things makes use\nof Spinoza and Martin Buber’s theories of ethics, Karen\nBond’s comprehensive and multifaceted book, Dance and\nQuality of Life (which addresses among other things how dance\ncontributes to what is good for human beings, which is why this work has been included under the ethics category), Bresnahan and Deckard 2019\nand Hall 2018 on disability and dance, DeFrantz’s work on black\ndance and aesthetics (forthcoming and elsewhere), Eva Kit Wah\nMan’s new book on bodies, aesthetics and politics in China\n(2019) (which is not specifically on dance), Royona Mitra’s work\non Akram Khan’s style of dance and choreography as a form of\ninter-culturalism (2015 and 2018), Eric Mullis’ forthcoming\nessay on dance and political power, Halifu Osumare’s powerful\nmemoir, Dancing in Blackness (2018), and Sherman 2018 on\ndancers, soldiers and emotional engagement. See also the three-part\nessay on dance as embodied ethics in Bresnahan, Katan-Schmid, and\nHouston (2020). \nDance is developing in ways that include not just live, bodily\nperformances on stage but dance that is in digital, filmic and other\ntechnological or technologically-enhanced forms. New dance philosophy\n(as philosophy of these new dance arts) is emerging\naccordingly. Besides the short list of sources mentioned below the\nreader is encouraged to conduct dance philosophy research in film and\nemerging technology journals. \nDance philosophers who write on dance in film (or on film or filmic\ndance) include Brannigan 2014; Carroll 2001; McFee 2018; and Salzer\nand Baer 2015. Hetty Blades (2015a and 2015b) has written on dance,\nvirtual technology and scoring and her work centers on other forms of\ndance technology as well. For a piece on dance, ethics and technology\nsee Mullis 2015.
