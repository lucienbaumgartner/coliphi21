It is the\nsimplest example of what is often called a hidden variables\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics. In Bohmian mechanics a system of\nparticles is described in part by its wave function, evolving, as\nusual, according to Schrödinger’s equation. However, the\nwave function provides only a partial description of the system. This\ndescription is completed by the specification of the actual positions\nof the particles. The latter evolve according to the\n “guiding equation”,\n which expresses the velocities of the particles in terms of the wave\nfunction. Thus, in Bohmian mechanics the configuration of a system of\nparticles evolves via a deterministic motion choreographed by the wave\nfunction. In particular, when a particle is sent into a two-slit\napparatus, the slit through which it passes and its location upon\narrival on the photographic plate are completely determined by its\ninitial position and wave function.\n\n\nBohmian mechanics inherits and makes explicit the nonlocality implicit\nin the notion, common to just about all formulations and\ninterpretations of quantum theory, of a wave function on the\nconfiguration space of a many-particle system. It accounts for all of\nthe phenomena governed by nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, from\nspectral lines and scattering theory to superconductivity, the quantum\nHall effect and quantum computing. In particular, the usual\nmeasurement postulates of quantum theory, including collapse of the\nwave function and probabilities given by the absolute square of\nprobability amplitudes, emerge from an analysis of the two equations\nof motion: Schrödinger’s equation and the guiding equation.\nNo invocation of a special, and somewhat obscure, status for\nobservation is required.\n\nConceptual difficulties have plagued quantum mechanics since its\ninception, despite its extraordinary predictive successes. The basic\nproblem, plainly put, is this: It is not at all clear what quantum\nmechanics is about. What, in fact, does quantum mechanics describe?\n \nIt might seem, since it is widely agreed that any quantum mechanical\nsystem is completely described by its wave function, that quantum\nmechanics is fundamentally about the behavior of wave functions. Quite\nnaturally, no physicist wanted this to be true more than did Erwin\nSchrödinger, the father of the wave function. Nonetheless,\nSchrödinger ultimately found this impossible to believe. His\ndifficulty had little to do with the novelty of the wave function:\n \nThat it is an abstract, unintuitive mathematical construct is a\nscruple that almost always surfaces against new aids to thought and\nthat carries no great message. (Schrödinger [1935] 1980: 327)\n \nRather, it was that the “blurring” that the spread out\ncharacter of the wave function suggests “affects macroscopically\ntangible and visible things, for which the term ‘blurring’\nseems simply wrong”. \nFor example, in the same paper Schrödinger noted that it may\nhappen in radioactive decay that \nthe emerging particle is described … as a spherical wave\n… that impinges continuously on a surrounding luminescent\nscreen over its full expanse. The screen however does not show a more\nor less constant uniform surface glow, but rather lights up at\none instant at one spot …. (Schrödinger\n[1935] 1980: 327–328)  \nAnd he observed that one can easily arrange, for example by including\na cat in the system, “quite ridiculous cases” with  \nthe \\(\\psi\\)-function of the entire system having in it the living and\nthe dead cat (pardon the expression) mixed or smeared out in equal\nparts. (Schrödinger [1935] 1980: 328)  \nIt is thus because of the “measurement problem”, of\nmacroscopic superpositions, that Schrödinger found it difficult\nto regard the wave function as “representing reality”. But\nthen what does? With evident disapproval, Schrödinger observes\nthat \nthe reigning doctrine rescues itself or us by having recourse to\nepistemology. We are told that no distinction is to be made between\nthe state of a natural object and what I know about it, or perhaps\nbetter, what I can know about it if I go to some trouble.\nActually—so they say—there is intrinsically only\nawareness, observation, measurement. (Schrödinger [1935] 1980:\n328)  \nMany physicists pay lip service to the Copenhagen\ninterpretation—that quantum mechanics is fundamentally about\nobservation or results of measurement. But it is becoming increasingly\ndifficult to find any who, when pressed, will defend this\ninterpretation. It seems clear that quantum mechanics is fundamentally\nabout atoms and electrons, quarks and strings, not those particular\nmacroscopic regularities associated with what we call\nmeasurements of the properties of these things. But if these\nentities are not somehow identified with the wave function\nitself—and if talk of them is not merely shorthand for elaborate\nstatements about measurements—then where are they to be found in\nthe quantum description? \nThere is, perhaps, a very simple reason why it is so difficult to\ndiscern in the quantum description the objects we believe quantum\nmechanics ought to describe. Perhaps the quantum mechanical\ndescription is not the whole story, a possibility most prominently\nassociated with Albert Einstein. (For a general discussion of\nEinstein’s scientific philosophy, and in particular of his\napproach to the conflicting positions of realism and positivism, see\nthe entry on\n Einstein’s philosophy of science.) \nIn 1935 Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen defended this\npossibility in their famous EPR paper. They concluded with this\nobservation: \nWhile we have thus shown that the wave function does not provide a\ncomplete description of the physical reality, we left open the\nquestion of whether or not such a description exists. We believe,\nhowever, that such a theory is possible. (Einstein et al. 1935: 780)\n \nThe argument that the EPR paper advances to support this conclusion\ninvokes quantum correlations and an assumption of locality. (See the\nentries on\n the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument in quantum theory\n and on\n quantum entanglement and information.) \nLater, on the basis of more or less the same considerations as those\nof Schrödinger quoted above, Einstein again concluded that the\nwave function does not provide a complete description of individual\nsystems, an idea he called “this most nearly obvious\ninterpretation” (Einstein 1949: 672). In relation to a theory\nincorporating a more complete description, Einstein remarked that  \nthe statistical quantum theory would … take an approximately\nanalogous position to the statistical mechanics within the framework\nof classical mechanics. (Einstein 1949: 672)  \nWe note here, and show below, that Bohmian mechanics exactly fits this\ndescription. \nJohn von Neumann, one of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth\ncentury, claimed that he had proven that Einstein’s dream of a\ndeterministic completion or reinterpretation of quantum theory was\nmathematically impossible. He concluded that  \nIt is therefore not, as is often assumed, a question of a\nre-interpretation of quantum mechanics—the present system of\nquantum mechanics would have to be objectively false, in order that\nanother description of the elementary processes than the statistical\none be possible. (von Neumann [1932] 1955: 325)  \nPhysicists and philosophers of science almost universally accepted von\nNeumann’s claim. For example, Max Born, who formulated the\nstatistical interpretation of the wave function, assured us that  \nNo concealed parameters can be introduced with the help of which the\nindeterministic description could be transformed into a deterministic\none. Hence if a future theory should be deterministic, it cannot be a\nmodification of the present one but must be essentially different.\n(Born 1949: 109)  \nBohmian mechanics is a counterexample to the claims of von Neumann.\nThus von Neumann’s argument must be wrong. In fact, according to\nJohn Bell, von Neumann’s assumptions (about the relationships\namong the values of quantum observables that must be satisfied in a\nhidden-variables theory) are so unreasonable that the “the proof\nof von Neumann is not merely false but foolish!”\n(Mermin 1993: 805, fn 8, quoting an interview in Omni, May,\n1988: 88). Nonetheless, some physicists continue to rely on von\nNeumann’s proof.  \nRecently, however, physicists more commonly cite the\n Kochen-Specker Theorem\n and, more frequently,\n Bell’s inequality\n in support of the contention that a deterministic completion of\nquantum theory is impossible. We still find, a quarter of a century\nafter the rediscovery of Bohmian mechanics in 1952, statements such as\nthese: \nThe proof he [von Neumann] published …, though it was made much\nmore convincing later on by Kochen and Specker (1967), still uses\nassumptions which, in my opinion, can quite reasonably be questioned.\n… In my opinion, the most convincing argument against the\ntheory of hidden variables was presented by J.S. Bell (1964). (Wigner\n[1976] 1983: 291)  \nNow there are many more statements of a similar character that we\ncould cite. This quotation is significant because Wigner was one of\nthe leading physicists of his generation. Unlike most of his\ncontemporaries, moreover, he was also profoundly concerned about the\nconceptual foundations of quantum mechanics and wrote on the subject\nwith great clarity and insight. \nThere was, however, one physicist who wrote on this subject with even\ngreater clarity and insight than Wigner himself: the very J. S. Bell\nwhom Wigner praises for demonstrating the impossibility of a\ndeterministic completion of quantum theory such as Bohmian mechanics.\nHere’s how Bell himself reacted to Bohm’s discovery: \nBut in 1952 I saw the impossible done. It was in papers by David Bohm. Bohm showed explicitly how parameters could indeed be\nintroduced, into nonrelativistic wave mechanics, with the help of\nwhich the indeterministic description could be transformed into a\ndeterministic one. More importantly, in my opinion, the subjectivity\nof the orthodox version, the necessary reference to the\n“observer”, could be eliminated. … \nBut why then had Born not told me of this “pilot wave”? If\nonly to point out what was wrong with it? Why did von Neumann not\nconsider it? More extraordinarily, why did people go on producing\n“impossibility” proofs, after 1952, and as recently as\n1978? … Why is the pilot wave picture ignored in text books?\nShould it not be taught, not as the only way, but as an antidote to\nthe prevailing complacency? To show us that vagueness, subjectivity,\nand indeterminism, are not forced on us by experimental facts, but by\ndeliberate theoretical choice? (Bell 1982, reprinted in 1987c: 160)  \nWigner to the contrary notwithstanding, Bell did not establish the\nimpossibility of a deterministic reformulation of quantum theory, nor\ndid he ever claim to have done so. On the contrary, until his untimely\ndeath in 1990, Bell was the prime proponent, and for much of this\nperiod almost the sole proponent, of the very theory, Bohmian\nmechanics, that he supposedly demolished. \nBohmian mechanics is of course as much a counterexample to the\nKochen-Specker argument for the impossibility of hidden variables as\nit is to the one of von Neumann. It is obviously a counterexample to\nany such argument. However reasonable the assumptions of such an\nargument, some of them must fail for Bohmian mechanics. \nWigner was quite right to suggest that the assumptions of Kochen and\nSpecker are more convincing than those of von Neumann. They appear, in\nfact, to be quite reasonable indeed. However, they are not. The\nimpression that they are arises from a pervasive error, an uncritical\nrealism about operators, that we discuss below in the sections on\n quantum observables,\n spin, and\n contextuality. \nJohn Bell replaced the “arbitrary axioms” (Bell 1966,\nreprinted 1987c: 11) of Kochen-Specker and others by an assumption of\nlocality, of no action-at-a-distance. It would be hard to argue\nagainst the reasonableness of such an assumption, even if one were so\nbold as to doubt its inevitability. Bell showed that any\nhidden-variables formulation of quantum mechanics must be nonlocal,\nas, indeed, Bohmian mechanics is. But he showed much much more. (For\nmore detail on Bell’s locality assumption, see Goldstein et al.\n2011 and Norsen 2011.)  \nIn a celebrated paper he published in 1964, Bell showed that quantum\ntheory itself is irreducibly nonlocal. (More precisely, Bell’s\nanalysis applies to any single-world version of quantum theory, i.e.,\nany version for which measurements have outcomes that, while they may\nbe random, are nonetheless unambiguous and definite, in contrast to\nthe situation with Everett’s many-worlds version of quantum\ntheory.) This fact about quantum mechanics, based as it is on a short\nand mathematically simple analysis, could have been recognized soon\nafter the discovery of quantum theory in the 1920’s. That this\ndid not happen is no doubt due in part to the obscurity of\n orthodox quantum theory\n and to the ambiguity of its commitments. (It almost did happen:\nSchrödinger 1935, in his famous cat paper, came remarkably close\nto discovering a Bell-type argument for quantum nonlocality. For\ndetails see Hemmick and Shakur 2012, chapter 4.) It was, in fact, his\nexamination of Bohmian mechanics that led Bell to his nonlocality\nanalysis. In the course of investigating Bohmian mechanics, he\nobserved that: \nin this theory an explicit causal mechanism exists whereby the\ndisposition of one piece of apparatus affects the results obtained\nwith a distant piece. … \nBohm of course was well aware of these features of his scheme, and has\ngiven them much attention. However, it must be stressed that, to the\npresent writer’s knowledge, there is no proof that\nany hidden variable account of quantum mechanics\nmust have this extraordinary character. It would therefore be\ninteresting, perhaps, to pursue some further “impossibility\nproofs”, replacing the arbitrary axioms objected to above by\nsome condition of locality, or of separability of distant systems.\n(Bell 1966: 452; reprinted 1987c: 11)  \nIn a footnote, Bell added that “Since the completion of this\npaper such a proof has been found” (1966: 452, fn. 19). He\npublished it in his 1964 paper, “On the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen\nParadox”. In this paper he derives Bell’s inequality, the\nbasis of his conclusion of quantum nonlocality. (See the entry on\n Bell’s Theorem.\n For a discussion of how nonlocality emerges in Bohmian mechanics, see\n Section 13.) \nIt is worth stressing that Bell’s analysis indeed shows that any\n(single-world) account of quantum phenomena must be nonlocal, not just\nany hidden variables account. Bell showed that the predictions of\nstandard quantum theory itself imply nonlocality. Thus if these\npredictions govern nature, then nature is nonlocal. [That nature is so\ngoverned, even in the crucial EPR-correlation experiments, has by now\nbeen established by a great many experiments. The first rather\nconclusive such experiment was that of Aspect (Aspect, Dalibard, &\nZanghì 1982). More conclusive still is the experiment of Weihs\net al. 1998. Very recently there have been several “loop-hole\nfree” tests of Bell’s inequality (Giustina et al. 2015;\nHensen et al. 2015; and Shalm et al. 2015).] \nBell, too, stressed this point (by determinism Bell here means hidden\nvariables): \nIt is important to note that to the limited degree to which\ndeterminism plays a role in the EPR argument, it is not\nassumed but inferred. What is held sacred is the principle of\n“local causality”—or “no action at a\ndistance”… \nIt is remarkably difficult to get this point across, that determinism\nis not a presupposition of the analysis. (Bell 1981a,\nreprinted 1987c: 143) \nDespite my insistence that the determinism was inferred rather than\nassumed, you might still suspect somehow that it is a preoccupation\nwith determinism that creates the problem. Note well then that the\nfollowing argument makes no mention whatever of determinism. …\nFinally you might suspect that the very notion of particle, and\nparticle orbit … has somehow led us astray. … So the\nfollowing argument will not mention particles, nor indeed fields, nor\nany other particular picture of what goes on at the microscopic level.\nNor will it involve any use of the words “quantum mechanical\nsystem”, which can have an unfortunate effect on the discussion.\nThe difficulty is not created by any such picture or any such\nterminology. It is created by the predictions about the correlations\nin the visible outputs of certain conceivable experimental set-ups.\n(Bell 1981a, reprinted 1987c: 150)  \nThe “problem” and “difficulty” to which Bell\nrefers above is the conflict between the predictions of quantum theory\nand what can be inferred, call it \\(C\\), from an assumption of\nlocality in Bohm’s version of the EPR argument, a conflict\nestablished by Bell’s inequality. \\(C\\) happens to concern the\nexistence of a certain kind of hidden variables, what might be called\nlocal hidden variables, but this fact is of little substantive\nimportance. What is important is not so much the identity of \\(C\\) as\nthe fact that \\(C\\) is incompatible with the predictions of quantum\ntheory. The identity of \\(C\\) is, however, of great historical\nsignificance: it is responsible for the misconception that Bell proved\nthat hidden variables are impossible, a belief that physicists until\nrecently almost universally shared, as well as for the view, even now\nalmost universally held, that what Bell’s result does is to rule\nout local hidden variables, a view that is misleading. \nHere again is Bell, expressing the logic of his two-part\ndemonstration of quantum nonlocality, the first part of which is\nBohm’s version of the EPR argument, concerning EPRB correlations: \nLet me summarize once again the logic that leads to the impasse. The\nEPRB correlations are such that the result of the experiment on one\nside immediately foretells that on the other, whenever the analyzers\nhappen to be parallel. If we do not accept the intervention on one\nside as a causal influence on the other, we seem obliged to admit that\nthe results on both sides are determined in advance anyway,\nindependently of the intervention on the other side, by signals from\nthe source and by the local magnet setting. But this has implications\nfor non-parallel settings which conflict with those of quantum\nmechanics. So we cannot dismiss intervention on one side as a\ncausal influence on the other. (Bell 1981a, reprinted 1987c: 149)  \nAs with just about everything else in the foundations of quantum\nmechanics, there remains considerable controversy about what exactly\nBell’s analysis demonstrates. (For further insight into the\nvarious controversies see Maudlin 2014 and Goldstein et al. 2011.)\nNonetheless, the opinion of Bell himself about what he showed is\nperfectly clear. See Norsen 2011 for a nice overview of Bell’s\nviews on the matter. \nThe pilot-wave approach to quantum theory was initiated by Einstein,\neven before the discovery of quantum mechanics itself. Einstein hoped\nthat interference phenomena involving particle-like photons could be\nexplained if the motion of the photons was somehow guided by the\nelectromagnetic field—which would thus play the role of what he\ncalled a Führungsfeld or guiding field (see Wigner\n[1976] 1983: 262 and Bacciagaluppi and Valentini 2009: Ch. 9). While\nthe notion of the electromagnetic field as guiding field turned out to\nbe rather problematical, Max Born explored the possibility that the\nwave function could play this role, of guiding field or pilot wave,\nfor a system of electrons in his early paper founding quantum\nscattering theory (Born 1926). Heisenberg was profoundly\nunsympathetic.  \nNot long after Schrödinger’s discovery of wave mechanics in\n1926, i.e., of Schrödinger’s equation, Louis de Broglie in\neffect discovered Bohmian mechanics: In 1927, de Broglie found an\nequation of particle motion equivalent to\n the guiding equation\n for a scalar wave function (de Broglie 1928: 119), and he explained\nat the 1927 Solvay Congress how this motion could account for quantum\ninterference phenomena. However, despite what is suggested by\nBacciagaluppi and Valentini (2009), de Broglie responded very poorly\nto an objection of Wolfgang Pauli (Pauli 1928) concerning inelastic\nscattering, no doubt making a rather bad impression on the illustrious\naudience at the congress. \nBorn and de Broglie very quickly abandoned the pilot-wave approach and\nbecame enthusiastic supporters of the rapidly developing consensus in\nfavor of the Copenhagen interpretation. David Bohm (1952) rediscovered\nde Broglie’s pilot-wave theory in 1952. He was the first person\nto genuinely understand its significance and implications. John Bell\nbecame its principal proponent during the sixties, seventies and\neighties. \nFor a very good discussion of the history of quantum mechanics, the\ndebates about its foundations, and about the reception of Bohmian\nmechanics in particular, see Bricmont 2016. See also Beller 1999. \nIn Bohmian mechanics the wave function, obeying\nSchrödinger’s equation, does not provide a complete\ndescription or representation of a quantum system. Rather, it governs\nthe motion of the fundamental variables, the positions of the\nparticles: In the Bohmian mechanical version of nonrelativistic\nquantum theory, quantum mechanics is fundamentally about the behavior\nof particles; the particles are described by their positions, and\nBohmian mechanics prescribes how these change with time. In this\nsense, for Bohmian mechanics the particles are primary, or primitive,\nwhile the wave function is secondary, or derivative.  \nWarning: It is the positions of the particles in Bohmian mechanics\nthat are its “hidden variables”, an unfortunate bit of\nterminology. As Bell writes, referring to Bohmian mechanics and\nsimilar theories, \nAbsurdly, such theories are known as “hidden variable”\ntheories. Absurdly, for there it is not in the wavefunction that one\nfinds an image of the visible world, and the results of experiments,\nbut in the complementary “hidden”(!) variables. Of course\nthe extra variables are not confined to the visible\n“macroscopic” scale. For no sharp definition of such a\nscale could be made. The “microscopic” aspect of the\ncomplementary variables is indeed hidden from us. But to admit things\nnot visible to the gross creatures that we are is, in my opinion, to\nshow a decent humility, and not just a lamentable addiction to\nmetaphysics. In any case, the most hidden of all variables, in the\npilot wave picture, is the wavefunction, which manifests itself to us\nonly by its influence on the complementary variables. (1987a,\nreprinted 1987c: 201–202)  \nBohmian mechanics is the minimal completion of\nSchrödinger’s equation, for a nonrelativistic system of\nparticles, to a theory describing a genuine motion of particles. For\nBohmian mechanics the state of a system of \\(N\\) particles is\ndescribed by its wave function \\(\\psi = \\psi(\\boldsymbol{q}_1 ,\\ldots\n,\\boldsymbol{q}_N) = \\psi(q)\\), a complex (or spinor-valued) function\non the space of possible configurations \\(q\\) of the system, together\nwith its actual configuration \\(Q\\) defined by the actual positions\n\\(\\mathbf{Q}_1 ,\\ldots ,\\mathbf{Q}_N\\) of its particles. (The word\n“spinor” refers to a suitable array of complex numbers in\nplace of a single one. Spinor-valued wave functions are used in\nquantum mechanics to describe electrons and other quantum particles\nthat “have spin”.) The theory is then defined by two\nevolution equations: Schrödinger’s equation \n\n\\[\ni\\hslash\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} = H\\psi\n\\]\n\n for\n\\(\\psi(t)\\), where \\(H\\) is the nonrelativistic (Schrödinger)\nHamiltonian, containing the masses of the particles and a potential\nenergy term, and (writing \\(\\Im[z]\\) for the imaginary part \\(b\\) of a\ncomplex number \\(z = a +\\di b)\\) a first-order evolution equation,\n \nThe Guiding Equation \n\n\\[ \\frac{d\\mathbf{Q}_k}{dt} = \\frac{\\hslash}{m_k} \\Im\n{{\\psi^*\\partial_k\\psi} \\over{\\psi^*\\psi}} (\\mathbf{Q}_1 ,\\ldots\n,\\mathbf{Q}_N) \\]\n\n  \nfor \\(Q(t)\\), the simplest first-order evolution equation for the\npositions of the particles that is compatible with the Galilean (and\ntime-reversal) covariance of the Schrödinger evolution\n(Dürr, Goldstein, & Zanghì 1992a: 852–854). Here\n\\(\\hslash\\) is Planck’s constant divided by \\(2\\pi\\),\nm\\(_k\\) is the mass of the \\(k\\)-th particle, and\n\\(\\partial_k = (\\partial /\\partial x_k,\\partial /\\partial y_k,\\partial\n/\\partial z_k)\\) is the gradient with respect to the generic\ncoordinates \\(\\boldsymbol{q}_k = (x_k,y_k,z_k)\\) of the \\(k\\)-th\nparticle. If \\(\\psi\\) is spinor-valued, the two products involving\n\\(\\psi\\) in the equation should be understood as scalar products\n(involving sums of products of spinor components). When external\nmagnetic fields are present, the gradient should be understood as the\ncovariant derivative, involving the vector potential. (Since the\ndenominator on the right hand side of the guiding equation vanishes at\nthe nodes of \\(\\psi\\), global existence and uniqueness for the Bohmian\ndynamics is a nontrivial matter. It is proven in Berndl, Dürr, et\nal. 1995 and in Teufel and Tumulka 2005.)  \nFor an \\(N\\)-particle system these two equations (together with the\ndetailed specification of the Hamiltonian, including all interactions\ncontributing to the potential energy) completely define Bohmian\nmechanics. This deterministic theory of particles in motion accounts\nfor all the phenomena of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, from\ninterference effects to spectral lines (Bohm 1952: 175–178) to\nspin (Bell 1964: 10). It does so in an entirely ordinary manner, as we\nexplain in the following sections. \nFor a scalar wave function, describing particles without spin, the\nform of\n the guiding equation\n above is a little more complicated than necessary, since the complex\nconjugate of the wave function, which appears in the numerator and the\ndenominator, cancels out. If one looks for an evolution equation for\nthe configuration compatible with the space-time symmetries of\nSchrödinger’s equation, one almost immediately arrives at\nthe guiding equation in this simpler form as the simplest\npossibility. \nHowever, the form above has two advantages: First, it makes sense for\nparticles with spin—and, in fact, Bohmian mechanics without\nfurther ado accounts for all the apparently paradoxical quantum\nphenomena associated with spin. Secondly, and this is crucial to the\nfact that Bohmian mechanics is empirically equivalent to orthodox\nquantum theory, the right hand side of the guiding equation is\n\\(J/\\varrho\\), the ratio of the quantum probability current to the\nquantum probability density. This shows that it should require no\nimagination whatsoever to guess the guiding equation from\nSchrödinger’s equation, provided one is looking for one,\nsince the classical formula for current is density times velocity.\nMoreover, it follows from the quantum continuity equation \\(\\partial\n\\varrho /\\partial t + \\textrm{div} J = 0\\), an immediate consequence\nof Schrödinger’s equation, that if at some time (say the\ninitial time) the configuration \\(Q\\) of our system is random, with\ndistribution given by \\(\\lvert \\psi \\rvert^2 = \\psi *\\psi\\), this will\nalways be true (provided the system does not interact with its\nenvironment). \nThis demonstrates that it is wrong to claim that the predictions of\nquantum theory are incompatible with the existence of hidden\nvariables, with an underlying deterministic model in which quantum\nrandomness arises from averaging over ignorance. Bohmian mechanics\nprovides us with just such a model: For any quantum experiment we\nmerely take as the relevant Bohmian system the combined system,\nincluding the system upon which the experiment is performed as well as\nall the measuring instruments and other devices used to perform the\nexperiment (together with all other systems with which these have\nsignificant interaction over the course of the experiment). We then\nobtain the “hidden variables” model by regarding the\ninitial configuration of this big system as random in the usual\nquantum mechanical way, with distribution given by \\(\\lvert \\psi\n\\rvert^2\\). The guiding equation for the big system then transforms\nthe initial configuration into the final configuration at the\nconclusion of the experiment. It then follows that this final\nconfiguration of the big system, including in particular the\norientation of instrument pointers, will also be distributed in the\nquantum mechanical way. Thus our deterministic Bohmian model yields\nthe usual quantum predictions for the results of the experiment. \nAs the preceding paragraph suggests, and as we discuss in more detail\nlater, Bohmian mechanics does not need any “measurement\npostulates” or axioms governing the behavior of other\n“observables”. Any such axioms would be at best redundant\nand could be inconsistent. \nBesides the\n guiding equation,\n there are other velocity formulas with nice properties, including\nGalilean symmetry, and yielding theories that are empirically\nequivalent to orthodox quantum theory—and to Bohmian mechanics\n(Deotto & Ghirardi 1998). The Bohmian choice is arguably the\nsimplest. Moreover, Wiseman (2007) has shown that it is the Bohmian\nvelocity formula, given by the\n guiding equation,\n that, according to orthodox quantum theory, would be found in a\n“weak measurement” of the velocity of a particle. (Marian,\nZanghì, and Oriols 2016 have recently proposed an explicit\nprocedure for performing such a measurement.) And, somewhat\nparadoxically, it can be shown (Dürr, Goldstein, &\nZanghì 2009) that according to Bohmian mechanics such a\nmeasurement is indeed a genuine measurement of the particle’s\nvelocity—despite the existence of empirically equivalent\nvelocity formulas! Similarly, weak measurements could be used to\nmeasure trajectories. In fact, quite recently Kocsis et al. (2011)\nhave used weak measurements to reconstruct the trajectories for single\nphotons “as they undergo two-slit interference”, finding\n“those predicted in the Bohm-de Broglie interpretation of\nquantum mechanics”. And Mahler et al. 2016 have experimentally\nfound, using weak measurements, “Bohmian trajectories” for\nentangled photons, illustrating quantum nonlocality and the phenomenon\nof “surreal Bohmian trajectories”.  \nFor a single particle the guiding equation defines the motion of a\nparticle guided by a wave in physical 3-dimensional space. One might\nexpect that similar motions might arise classically. Couder & Fort\n(2006) have shown, by investigating interference-like phenomena in the\nmotion of bouncing oil droplets in a fluid, that this is indeed so.\nBush (2015) has further explored this sort of possibility for the\nemergence of a Bohmian version of quantum mechanics from something\nlike classical fluid dynamics. A serious obstacle to the success of\nsuch a program is the quantum entanglement and nonlocality\ncharacteristic of many-particle quantum systems. \nThe “many interacting worlds” approach of Hall, Deckert,\n& Wiseman (2014), independently advanced by Sebens (2015), retains\nparticle trajectories but attempts to do away with a wave-function at\nthe level of fundamental ontology. What takes its place is a large\nnumber of trajectories of points in configuration space, each\ncorresponding to the motions of a finite number of particles in\nphysical space regarded as describing a a world in its own right.\nThese interact in such a way as to mimic trajectories guided by a wave\nfunction: a coarse-grained density of worlds takes the place of\n\\(\\lvert \\psi \\rvert^2\\). The velocities of the world-particles are\nrequired to at least approximately be related to their configurations\nvia some smooth function on configuration space. This condition would\nbe a rather surprising one for the sorts of large systems studied in\nstatistical mechanics. Even more unmotivated from a classical\nperspective, the velocity function must be the gradient of a\nmultivalued function that obeys a Bohr-Sommerfeld-like quantum\ncondition.  \nWe stress that Bohmian mechanics should be regarded as a theory in its\nown right. Its viability does not depend on its being derivable from\nsome other theory, classical or otherwise. \nBohmian mechanics as presented here is a first-order theory, in which\nit is the velocity, the rate of change of position, that is\nfundamental. It is this quantity, given by\n the guiding equation,\n that the theory specifies directly and simply. The second-order\n(Newtonian) concepts of acceleration and force, work and energy do not\nplay any fundamental role. Bohm, however, did not regard his theory in\nthis way. He regarded it, fundamentally, as a second-order theory,\ndescribing particles moving under the influence of forces, among\nwhich, however, is a force stemming from a “quantum\npotential”. \nIn his 1952 hidden-variables paper, Bohm arrived at his theory by\nwriting the wave function in the polar form \\(\\psi =\nR\\)exp\\((iS/\\hslash)\\), where \\(S\\) and \\(R\\) are real, with \\(R\\)\nnonnegative, and rewriting Schrödinger’s equation in terms\nof these new variables to obtain a pair of coupled evolution\nequations: the continuity equation for \\(\\varrho = R^2\\) and a\nmodified Hamilton-Jacobi equation for \\(S\\). This differs from the\nusual classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation only by the appearance of an\nextra term, the quantum potential \n\n\\[\nU = {-}\\sum_k (\\hslash^2 /2m_k) (\\partial_{k}^2 R / R ),\n\\]\n\n alongside the\nclassical potential energy term.  \nBohm then used the modified Hamilton-Jacobi equation to define\nparticle trajectories just as one does for the classical\nHamilton-Jacobi equation, that is, by identifying \\(\\partial_k S\\)\nwith \\(m_k\\boldsymbol{v}_k\\), i.e., by setting \n\n\\[\nd\\mathbf{Q}_k /dt = \\partial_k S / m_k.\n\\]\n\n This is\nequivalent to\n the guiding equation\n for particles without spin. [In this form the (pre-Schrödinger\nequation) de Broglie relation \\(\\boldsymbol{p} = \\hslash\n\\boldsymbol{k}\\), as well as by the eikonal equation of classical\noptics, already suggest the guiding equation.] The resulting motion is\nprecisely what would be obtained classically if the particles were\nacted upon by the force generated by the quantum potential, in\naddition to the usual forces. \nThe quantum potential formulation of the de Broglie-Bohm theory is\nstill fairly widely used. For example, the monographs by Bohm and\nHiley and by Holland present the theory in this way. And regardless of\nwhether or not we regard the quantum potential as fundamental, it can\nin fact be quite useful. In order to see most clearly that Newtonian\nmechanics should be expected to emerge from Bohmian mechanics in the\nclassical limit, it is convenient to transform the theory into\nBohm’s Hamilton-Jacobi form. Then the (size of the) quantum\npotential provides a measure of the deviation of Bohmian mechanics\nfrom its classical approximation. Moreover, the quantum potential is\nalso useful for developing approximation schemes for solutions to\nSchrödinger’s equation (Nerukh & Frederick 2000). \nHowever, Bohm’s rewriting of Schrödinger’s equation\nin terms of variables that seem interpretable in classical terms is\nnot without a cost. The most obvious is an increase in complexity:\nSchrödinger’s equation is rather simple, and it is linear,\nwhereas the modified Hamilton-Jacobi equation is somewhat complicated,\nand highly nonlinear. Moreover the latter, since it involves \\(R\\),\nrequires the continuity equation for its closure. The quantum\npotential itself is neither simple nor natural. Even to Bohm it seemed\n“rather strange and arbitrary” (Bohm 1980: 80). And it is\nnot very satisfying to think of the quantum revolution as amounting to\nthe insight that nature is classical after all, except that there is\nin nature what appears to be a rather ad hoc additional force\nterm, the one arising from the quantum potential. The artificiality\nthat the quantum potential suggests is the price one pays for casting\na highly nonclassical theory into a classical mold. \nMoreover, the connection between classical mechanics and Bohmian\nmechanics that the quantum potential suggests is rather misleading.\nBohmian mechanics is not simply classical mechanics with an additional\nforce term. In Bohmian mechanics the velocities are not independent of\npositions, as they are classically, but are constrained by the guiding\nequation. (In classical Hamilton-Jacobi theory we also have this\nequation for the velocity, but there the Hamilton-Jacobi function\n\\(S\\) can be entirely eliminated and the description in terms of \\(S\\)\nsimplified and reduced to a finite-dimensional description, with basic\nvariables the positions and the (unconstrained) momenta of all the\nparticles, given by Hamilton’s or Newton’s equations.) \nArguably, the most serious flaw in the quantum potential formulation\nof Bohmian mechanics is that it gives a completely false impression of\nthe lengths to which we must go in order to convert orthodox quantum\ntheory into something more rational. The quantum potential suggests,\nas has often been stated, that transforming Schrödinger’s\nequation into a theory that can account in “realistic”\nterms for quantum phenomena, many of which are dramatically nonlocal,\nrequires adding to the theory a complicated quantum potential of a\ngrossly nonlocal character. It should be clear that this view is\ninappropriate. After all, the quantum potential need not even be\nmentioned in the formulation of Bohmian mechanics, and it in\nany case merely reflects the wave function, which Bohmian mechanics\nshares with orthodox quantum theory. \nAccording to Richard Feynman, the two-slit experiment for electrons is\n \na phenomenon which is impossible, absolutely impossible, to\nexplain in any classical way, and which has in it the heart of quantum\nmechanics. In reality it contains the only mystery. (Feynman,\nLeighton, & Sands 1963: 37–2)  \nThis experiment  \nhas been designed to contain all of the mystery of quantum mechanics,\nto put you up against the paradoxes and mysteries and peculiarities of\nnature one hundred per cent. (Feynman 1967: 130)  \nAs to the question,  \nHow does it really work? What machinery is actually producing this\nthing? Nobody knows any machinery. Nobody can give you a deeper\nexplanation of this phenomenon than I have given; that is, a\ndescription of it. (Feynman 1967: 145)  \nBut Bohmian mechanics is just such a deeper explanation. It resolves\nin a rather straightforward manner the dilemma of the appearance of\nboth particle and wave properties in one and the same phenomenon:\nBohmian mechanics is a theory of motion describing a particle (or\nparticles) guided by a wave. Here we have a family of Bohmian\ntrajectories for the two-slit experiment. \nFigure 1: An ensemble of trajectories\nfor the two-slit experiment, uniform in the slits.\n\n(adapted by Gernot Bauer from Philippidis, Dewdney, & Hiley 1979:\n23, fig. 3) \nWhile each trajectory passes through only one slit, the wave passes\nthrough both; the interference profile that therefore develops in the\nwave generates a similar pattern in the trajectories guided by the\nwave. \nCompare Feynman’s presentation with Bell’s: \nIs it not clear from the smallness of the scintillation on the screen\nthat we have to do with a particle? And is it not clear, from the\ndiffraction and interference patterns, that the motion of the particle\nis directed by a wave? De Broglie showed in detail how the motion of a\nparticle, passing through just one of two holes in screen, could be\ninfluenced by waves propagating through both holes. And so influenced\nthat the particle does not go where the waves cancel out, but is\nattracted to where they cooperate. This idea seems to me so natural\nand simple, to resolve the wave-particle dilemma in such a clear and\nordinary way, that it is a great mystery to me that it was so\ngenerally ignored. (Bell [1989] 1987c: 191)  \nPerhaps the most puzzling aspect of the two-slit experiment is the\nfollowing: If, by any means whatsoever, it is possible to determine\nthe slit through which the particle passes, the interference pattern\nwill be destroyed. This dramatic effect of observation is, in fact, a\nsimple consequence of Bohmian mechanics. To see this, one must\nconsider the meaning of determining the slit through which the\nparticle passes. This must involve interaction with another system\nthat the Bohmian mechanical analysis must include. \nThe destruction of interference is related, naturally enough, to the\nBohmian mechanical analysis of quantum measurement (Bohm 1952). It\noccurs via the mechanism that in Bohmian mechanics leads to the\n “collapse of the wave function”. \nFor an accessible presentation of the behavior of Bohmian trajectories\nin scattering and tunneling phenomena, see Norsen 2013. \nThe\n measurement problem\n is the most commonly cited of the conceptual difficulties that plague\nquantum mechanics. (It amounts, more or less, to the paradox of\nSchrödinger’s cat.) Indeed, for many physicists the\nmeasurement problem is not merely one conceptual difficulty of quantum\nmechanics; it is the conceptual difficulty.  \nThe problem is as follows. Suppose that the wave function of any\nindividual system provides a complete description of that system. When\nwe analyze the process of measurement in quantum mechanical terms, we\nfind that the after-measurement wave function for system and apparatus\nthat arises from Schrödinger’s equation for the composite\nsystem typically involves a superposition over terms corresponding to\nwhat we would like to regard as the various possible results of the\nmeasurement—e.g., different pointer orientations. In this\ndescription of the after-measurement situation it is difficult to\ndiscern the actual result of the measurement—e.g., some specific\npointer orientation. But the whole point of quantum theory, and the\nreason we should believe in it, is that it is supposed to provide a\ncompelling, or at least an efficient, account of our observations,\nthat is, of the outcomes of measurements. In short, the measurement\nproblem is this: Quantum theory implies that measurements typically\nfail to have outcomes of the sort the theory was created to\nexplain. \nIn contrast, if we, like Einstein, regard the description provided by\nthe wave function as incomplete, the measurement problem vanishes:\nThere is no measurement problem with a theory or interpretation in\nwhich, as in Bohmian mechanics, the description of the\nafter-measurement situation includes, in addition to the wave\nfunction, at least the values of the variables that register the\nresult. In Bohmian mechanics pointers always point. \nOften, the measurement problem is expressed a little differently.\nTextbook quantum theory provides two rules for the evolution of the\nwave function of a quantum system: A deterministic dynamics given by\nSchrödinger’s equation when the system is not being\n“measured” or observed, and a random collapse of the wave\nfunction to an eigenstate of the “measured\nobservable” when it is. However, the objection continues,\ntextbook quantum theory does not explain how to reconcile these two\napparently incompatible rules. \nThat this formulation of the measurement problem and the preceding one\nare more or less equivalent should be reasonably clear: If a wave\nfunction provides a complete description of the after-measurement\nsituation, the outcome of the measurement must correspond to a wave\nfunction that describes the actual result, that is, a\n“collapsed” wave function. Hence the collapse rule. But it\nis difficult to take seriously the idea that different laws than those\ngoverning all other interactions should govern those interactions\nbetween system and apparatus that we happen to call measurements.\nHence the apparent incompatibility of the two rules. \nThe second formulation of the measurement problem, though basically\nequivalent to the first, raises an important question: Can Bohmian\nmechanics itself reconcile these two dynamical rules? How does Bohmian\nmechanics justify the use of the “collapsed” wave function\ninstead of the original one? This question was answered in\nBohm’s first papers on Bohmian mechanics (Bohm 1952: Part I,\nSection 7 and Part II, Section 2). What would nowadays be called\neffects of decoherence, which interaction with the environment (air\nmolecules, cosmic rays, internal microscopic degrees of freedom, etc.)\nproduces, make difficult the development of significant overlap\nbetween the component of the after-measurement wave function\ncorresponding to the actual result of the measurement and the other\ncomponents of the after-measurement wave function. (This overlap\nrefers to the configuration space of the very large system that\nincludes all systems with which the original system and apparatus come\ninto interaction.) But without such overlap that component all by\nitself generates to a high degree of accuracy the future evolution of\nthe configuration of the system and apparatus. The replacement is thus\njustified as a practical matter (see also Dürr, Goldstein &\nZanghì 1992a: Section 5). \nMany proponents of orthodox quantum theory believe that decoherence\nsomehow resolves the measurement problem itself. It is not easy to\nunderstand this belief. In the first formulation of the measurement\nproblem, nothing prevents us from including in the apparatus all\nsources of decoherence. But then decoherence can no longer be in any\nway relevant to the argument. Be that as it may, Bohm (1952) gave one\nof the best descriptions of the mechanisms of decoherence, though he\ndid not use the word itself. He recognized its importance several\ndecades before it became fashionable. (See also the encyclopedia entry\non\n The Role of Decoherence in Quantum Mechanics.) \nIn the previous section we indicated that collapse of the wave\nfunction can be regarded in Bohmian mechanics as a pragmatic affair.\nHowever, there is a sense in which the collapse of the wave function\nin Bohmian mechanics is more than a matter of convenience. If we focus\non the appropriate notion of the wave function, not of the composite\nof system and apparatus—which strictly speaking remains a\nsuperposition if the composite is treated as closed during the\nmeasurement process—but of the system itself, we find that for\nBohmian mechanics this does indeed collapse, precisely as the quantum\nformalism says. The key element here is the notion of the\nconditional wave function of a subsystem of a larger system,\nwhich we describe briefly in this section and that Dürr,\nGoldstein, & Zanghì 1992a: Section 5, discuss in some\ndetail, together with the related notion of the effective wave\nfunction.  \nFor the evolution of the wave function, Bohmian mechanics is\nformulated in terms of Schrödinger’s equation alone.\nNonetheless the textbook collapse rule is a consequence of the Bohmian\ndynamics. To appreciate this one should first note that, since\nobservation implies interaction, a system under observation cannot be\na closed system but rather must be a subsystem of a larger closed\nsystem, which we may take to be the entire universe, or any smaller\nmore or less closed system that contains the system to be observed,\nthe subsystem. The configuration \\(Q\\) of this larger system\nnaturally splits into \\(X\\), the configuration of the subsystem, and\n\\(Y\\), the configuration of the environment of the\nsubsystem. \nSuppose the larger system has wave function \\(\\Psi = \\Psi(q) = \\Psi(x,\ny)\\). According to Bohmian mechanics, the larger system is then\ncompletely described by \\(\\Psi\\), evolving according to\nSchrödinger’s equation, together with \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). The\nquestion then arises—and it is a critical question—as to\nwhat should be meant by the wave function of the subsystem. \nThere is a rather obvious answer for this, a natural function of \\(x\\)\nthat suitably incorporates the objective structure at hand, namely the\nconditional wave function \n\n\\[\\psi(x) = \\Psi(x, Y)\\]\n\n obtained by plugging\nthe actual configuration of the environment into the wave function of\nthe larger system. (This definition is appropriate only for scalar\nwave functions; for particles with spin the situation would be a\nlittle more complicated.) It then follows immediately that the\nconfiguration of the subsystem obeys\n the guiding equation\n with the conditional wave function on its right-hand side. \nMoreover, taking into account the way that the conditional wave\nfunction depends upon time \\(t\\) \n\n\\[\\psi_t (x) = \\Psi_t (x, Y_t)\\]\n\n via the time dependence\nof \\(Y\\) as well as that of \\(\\Psi\\), it is not difficult to see\n(Dürr, Goldstein, & Zanghì 1992a) the following two\nthings about the evolution of the conditional wave: First, that it\nobeys Schrödinger’s equation for the subsystem when that\nsystem is suitably decoupled from its environment. Part of what is\nmeant by this decoupling is that \\(\\Psi\\) has a special form, what\nmight be called an effective product form (similar to but more general\nthan the superposition produced in an “ideal quantum\nmeasurement”), in which case the conditional wave function of\nthe subsystem is also called its effective wave function.\nSecond, using the\n quantum equilibrium hypothesis,\n that it randomly collapses according to the usual quantum mechanical\nrules under precisely those conditions on the interaction between the\nsubsystem and its environment that define an ideal quantum\nmeasurement. \nIt is perhaps worth noting that orthodox quantum theory lacks the\nresources that make it possible to define the conditional wave\nfunction, namely, the actual configuration \\(Y\\) of the environment.\nIndeed, from an orthodox point of view what should be meant by the\nwave function of a subsystem is entirely obscure. \nAccording to the quantum formalism, for a system with wave function\n\\(\\psi\\) the probability density for finding its configuration to be\n\\(q\\) is \\(\\lvert\\psi(q)\\rvert^2\\). To the extent that the results of\nmeasurement are registered configurationally, at least potentially, it\nfollows that the predictions of Bohmian mechanics for the results of\nmeasurement must agree with those of orthodox quantum theory (assuming\nthe same Schrödinger equation for both) provided that it is\nsomehow true for Bohmian mechanics that configurations are random,\nwith distribution given by the quantum equilibrium\ndistribution \\(\\lvert\\psi(q)\\rvert^2\\). Now the status and\njustification of this quantum equilibrium hypothesis is a\nrather delicate matter, one that has been explored in considerable\ndetail (Dürr, Goldstein, & Zanghì 1992a). Here are a\nfew relevant points. \nIt is nowadays a rather familiar fact that dynamical systems quite\ngenerally give rise to behavior of a statistical character, with the\nstatistics given by the (or a) stationary probability distribution for\nthe dynamics. So it is with Bohmian mechanics, except that for the\nBohmian system stationarity is not quite the right concept. Rather it\nis the notion of equivariance that is relevant. A probability\ndistribution on configuration space \\(\\varrho^{\\psi}\\), depending upon\nthe wave function \\(\\psi\\), is equivariant if \n\n\\[(\\varrho^{\\psi})_t = \\varrho^{\\psi_t}\\]\n\nwhere the dependence on \\(t\\) on the right arises from\nSchrödinger’s equation and on the left from the evolution\non probability distributions arising from the flow that\n the guiding equation\n induces. Thus equivariance expresses the mutual compatibility,\nrelative to \\(\\varrho^{\\psi}\\), of the Schrödinger evolution of\nthe wave function and the Bohmian motion of the configuration. It is\nan immediate consequence of\n the guiding equation\n and the quantum continuity equation that \\(\\varrho^{\\psi} =\n\\lvert\\psi(q)\\rvert^2\\) is equivariant. (It can be shown in fact that\nthis is more or less the only equivariant possibility that is suitably\nlocal (Goldstein & Struyve 2007).) \nIn trying to understand the status in Bohmian mechanics of the quantum\nequilibrium distribution, it is perhaps helpful to think of \nquantum equilibrium, \\(\\varrho = \\lvert\\psi \\rvert^2\\) \nas roughly analogous to (classical)  \nthermodynamic equilibrium, \\(\\varrho = \\textrm{exp} (-H/kT)\n/Z\\), \nthe probability distribution of the phase-space point of a system in\nequilibrium at temperature \\(T\\). (\\(Z\\) is a normalization constant\ncalled the partition function and \\(k\\) is Boltzmann’s\nconstant.) This analogy has several facets: In both cases the\nprobability distributions are naturally associated with their\nrespective dynamical systems. In particular, these distributions are\nstationary or, what amounts to the same thing within the framework of\nBohmian mechanics, equivariant. In both cases it seems natural to try\nto justify these equilibrium distributions by means of mixing-type,\nconvergence-to-equilibrium arguments (Bohm 1953; Valentini &\nWestman 2005). It has been argued, however, that in both cases the\nultimate justification for these probability distributions must be in\nterms of statistical patterns that ensembles of actual subsystems\nwithin a typical individual universe exhibit (Bell 1981b,\nreprinted 1987c: 129; Dürr, Goldstein, & Zanghì\n1992a). In both cases the status of, and justification for,\nequilibrium distributions is still controversial. It is also perhaps\nworth noting that the typicality-grounded account of quantum\nrandomness in Bohmian mechanics is extremely similar to\nEverett’s account (Everett 1957) of quantum randomness for\n“many worlds”, despite the huge metaphysical differences\nthat exist between these two versions of quantum theory. It can be\nshown (Dürr, Goldstein, & Zanghì 1992a) that\nprobabilities for positions given by the quantum equilibrium\ndistribution emerge naturally from an analysis of\n“equilibrium” for the deterministic dynamical system that\nBohmian mechanics defines, much as the Maxwellian velocity\ndistribution emerges from an analysis of classical thermodynamic\nequilibrium. (For more on the thermodynamic side of the analogy see\nGoldstein 2001.) Thus with Bohmian mechanics the statistical\ndescription in quantum theory indeed takes, as Einstein anticipated,\n“an approximately analogous position to the statistical\nmechanics within the framework of classical mechanics”. \nOrthodox quantum theory supplies us with probabilities not merely for\npositions but for a huge class of quantum observables. It might thus\nappear that it is a much richer theory than Bohmian mechanics, which\nseems exclusively concerned with positions. Appearances are, however,\nmisleading. In this regard, as with so much else in the foundations of\nquantum mechanics, Bell made the crucial observation:  \n[I]n physics the only observations we must consider are position\nobservations, if only the positions of instrument pointers. It is a\ngreat merit of the de Broglie-Bohm picture to force us to consider\nthis fact. If you make axioms, rather than definitions and theorems,\nabout the “measurement” of anything else, then you commit\nredundancy and risk inconsistency. (Bell 1982, reprinted 1987c: 166)\n \nConsider classical mechanics first. The observables are functions on\nphase space, functions of the positions and momenta of the particles.\nThe axioms governing the behavior of the basic\nobservables—Newton’s equations for the positions or\nHamilton’s for positions and momenta—define the theory.\nWhat would be the point of making additional axioms, for other\nobservables? After all, the behavior of the basic observables entirely\ndetermines the behavior of any observable. For example, for classical\nmechanics, the principle of the conservation of energy is a theorem,\nnot an axiom.  \nThe situation might seem to differ in quantum mechanics, as usually\nconstrued. Here there is no small set of basic observables having the\nproperty that all other observables are functions of them. Moreover,\nno observables at all are taken seriously as describing objective\nproperties, as actually having values whether or not they are or have\nbeen measured. Rather, all talk of observables in quantum mechanics is\nsupposed to be understood as talk about the measurement of the\nobservables. \nBut if this is so, the situation with regard to other observables in\nquantum mechanics is not really that different from that in classical\nmechanics. Whatever quantum mechanics means by the measurement of (the\nvalues of) observables—that, we are urged to believe,\ndon’t actually have values—must at least refer to some\nexperiment involving interaction between the “measured”\nsystem and a “measuring” apparatus leading to a\nrecognizable result, as given potentially by, say, a pointer\norientation. But then if some axioms suffice for the behavior of\npointer orientations (at least when they are observed), rules about\nthe measurement of other observables must be theorems, following from\nthose axioms, not additional axioms. \nIt should be clear from the discussion\n towards the end of Section 4\n and at the\n beginning of Section 9\n that, assuming the quantum equilibrium hypothesis, any analysis of\nthe measurement of a quantum observable for orthodox quantum\ntheory—whatever it is taken to mean and however the\ncorresponding experiment is performed—provides ipso facto at\nleast as adequate an account for Bohmian mechanics. The only part of\northodox quantum theory relevant to the analysis is the\nSchrödinger evolution, and it shares this with Bohmian\nmechanics. The main difference between them is that orthodox quantum\ntheory encounters\n the measurement problem\n before it reaches a satisfactory conclusion while Bohmian mechanics\ndoes not. This difference stems of course from what Bohmian mechanics\nadds to orthodox quantum theory: actual configurations. \nThe rest of this section will discuss the significance of quantum\nobservables for Bohmian mechanics. (It follows from what has been said\nin the three preceding paragraphs that what we conclude here about\nquantum observables for Bohmian mechanics holds for orthodox quantum\ntheory as well.) \nBohmian mechanics yields a natural association between experiments and\nso-called generalized observables, given by\npositive-operator-valued measures (Davies 1976), or POVMs, \\(O(dz)\\),\non the value spaces for the results of the experiments (Berndl,\nDaumer, et al. 1995). This association is such that the probability\ndistribution of the result \\(Z\\) of an experiment, when performed upon\na system with wave function \\(\\psi\\), is given by \\(\\langle \\psi |\nO(dz)\\psi \\rangle\\) (where \\(\\langle | \\rangle\\) is the usual\n inner product\n between quantum state vectors). \nMoreover, this conclusion is follows immediately from the very meaning\nof an experiment from a Bohmian perspective: a coupling of system to\napparatus leading to a result \\(Z\\) that is a function of the final\nconfiguration of the total system, e.g., the orientation of a pointer.\nAnalyzed in Bohmian mechanical terms, the experiment defines a map\nfrom the initial wave function of the system to the distribution of\nthe result. It follows directly from the structure of Bohmian\nmechanics, and from the fact that the quantum equilibrium distribution\nis quadratic in the wave function, that this map is bilinear (or, more\nprecisely, sesquilinear, in that its dependence on one factor of the\nwave function is antilinear, involving complex conjugation, rather\nthan linear). Such a map is equivalent to a POVM. \nThe simplest example of a POVM is a standard quantum observable,\ncorresponding to a self-adjoint operator \\(A\\) on the Hilbert space of\nquantum states (i.e., wave functions). For Bohmian mechanics, more or\nless every “measurement-like” experiment is associated\nwith this special kind of POVM. The familiar quantum measurement axiom\nthat the distribution of the result of the “measurement of the\nobservable \\(A\\)” is given by the spectral measure for\n\\(A\\) relative to the wave function (in the very simplest cases just\nthe absolute squares of the so-called probability amplitudes)\nis thus obtained. \nFor various reasons, after the discovery of quantum mechanics it\nquickly became almost universal to speak of an experiment associated\nwith an operator \\(A\\) in the manner just sketched as a\nmeasurement of the observable \\(A\\)—as if the\noperator somehow corresponded to a property of the system that the\nexperiment in some sense measures. It has been argued that this\nassumption, which has been called naive realism about\noperators, has been a source of considerable confusion about the\nmeaning and implications of quantum theory (Daumer et al. 1997a). \nThe case of spin illustrates nicely both the way Bohmian mechanics\ntreats non-configurational quantum observables, and some of the\ndifficulties that the naive realism about operators mentioned above\ncauses.  \nSpin is the canonical quantum observable that has no classical\ncounterpart, reputedly impossible to grasp in a nonquantum way. The\ndifficulty is not quite that spin is quantized in the sense that its\nallowable values form a discrete set (for a spin-1/2 particle, \\(\\pm\n\\hslash/2\\)). Energy too may be quantized in this sense. Nor is it\nprecisely that the components of spin in the different directions fail\nto commute—and so cannot be simultaneously discussed, measured,\nimagined, or whatever it is that we are advised not to do with\nnoncommuting observables. Rather the problem is that there is no\nordinary (nonquantum) quantity which, like the spin observable, is a\n3-vector and which also is such that its components in all possible\ndirections belong to the same discrete set. The problem, in other\nwords, is that the usual vector relationships among the various\ncomponents of the spin vector are incompatible with the quantization\nconditions on the values of these components. \nFor a particle of spin-1 the problem is even more severe. The\ncomponents of spin in different directions aren’t simultaneously\nmeasurable. Thus, the impossible vector relationships for the spin\ncomponents of a quantum particle are not observable. Bell (1966), and,\nindependently, Simon Kochen and Ernst Specker (1967) showed that for a\nspin-1 particle the squares of the spin components in the various\ndirections satisfy, according to quantum theory, a collection of\nrelationships, each individually observable, that taken together are\nimpossible: the relationships are incompatible with the idea that\nmeasurements of these observables merely reveal their preexisting\nvalues rather than creating them, as quantum theory urges us to\nbelieve. Many physicists and philosophers of physics continue to\nregard the\n Kochen-Specker Theorem\n as precluding the possibility of hidden variables. \nWe thus might naturally wonder how Bohmian mechanics copes with spin.\nBut we have already answered this question. Bohmian mechanics makes\nsense for particles with spin, i.e., for particles whose wave\nfunctions are spinor-valued. When such particles are suitably directed\ntoward Stern-Gerlach magnets, they emerge moving in more or less a\ndiscrete set of directions—2 possible directions for a spin-1/2\nparticle, having 2 spin components, 3 for spin-1 with 3 spin\ncomponents, and so on. This occurs because the Stern-Gerlach magnets\nare so designed and oriented that a wave packet (a localized wave\nfunction with reasonably well defined velocity) directed towards the\nmagnet will, by virtue of the Schrödinger evolution, separate\ninto distinct packets—corresponding to the spin components of\nthe wave function and moving in the discrete set of directions. The\nparticle itself, depending upon its initial position, ends up in one\nof the packets moving in one of the directions. \nThe probability distribution for the result of such a\n Stern-Gerlach experiment\n can be conveniently expressed in terms of the quantum mechanical spin\noperators—for a spin-1/2 particle given by certain 2 by 2\nmatrices called the Pauli spin matrices—in the manner alluded to\n above.\n From a Bohmian perspective there is no hint of paradox in any of\nthis—unless we assume that the spin operators correspond to\ngenuine properties of the particles. \nFor further discussion and more detailed examples of the Bohmian\nperspective on spin see Norsen 2014. \nThe\n Kochen-Specker Theorem,\n the earlier theorem of Gleason (Gleason 1957 and Bell 1966), and\nother no-hidden-variables results, including Bell’s inequality\n(Bell 1964), show that any hidden-variables formulation of quantum\nmechanics must be contextual. It must violate the\nnoncontextuality assumption “that measurement of an observable\nmust yield the same value independently of what other measurements may\nbe made simultaneously” (1964, reprinted 1987c: 9). To many\nphysicists and philosophers of science contextuality seems too great a\nprice to pay for the rather modest benefits—largely\npsychological, so they would say—that hidden variables provide.\n \nEven many Bohmians suggest that contextuality departs significantly\nfrom classical principles. For example, Bohm and Hiley write that  \nThe context dependence of results of measurements is a further\nindication of how our interpretation does not imply a simple return to\nthe basic principles of classical physics. (1993: 100) \nHowever, to understand contextuality in Bohmian mechanics almost\nnothing needs to be explained. Consider an operator \\(A\\) that\ncommutes with operators \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) (which however don’t\ncommute with each other). What is often called the “result for\n\\(A\\)” in an experiment for “measuring \\(A\\) together with\n\\(B\\)” usually disagrees with the “result for \\(A\\)”\nin an experiment for “measuring \\(A\\) together with\n\\(C\\)”. This is because these experiments differ and different\nexperiments usually have different results. The misleading reference\nto measurement, which suggests that a pre-existing value of \\(A\\) is\nbeing revealed, makes contextuality seem more than it is. \nSeen properly, contextuality amounts to little more than the rather\nunremarkable observation that results of experiments should depend\nupon how they are performed, even when the experiments are associated\nwith the same operator in the manner alluded to\n above.\n David Albert (1992: 153) has given a particularly simple and striking\nexample of this dependence for Stern-Gerlach experiments\n“measuring” the \\(z\\)-component of spin. Reversing the\npolarity in a magnet for “measuring” the \\(z\\)-component\nof spin while keeping the same geometry yields another magnet for\n“measuring” the \\(z\\)-component of spin. The use of one or\nthe other of these two magnets will often lead to opposite conclusions\nabout the “value of the \\(z\\)-component of spin” prior to\nthe “measurement” (for the same initial value of the\nposition of the particle). \nAs Bell insists: \nA final moral concerns terminology. Why did such serious people take\nso seriously axioms which now seem so arbitrary? I suspect that they\nwere misled by the pernicious misuse of the word\n“measurement” in contemporary theory. This word very\nstrongly suggests the ascertaining of some preexisting property of\nsome thing, any instrument involved playing a purely passive role.\nQuantum experiments are just not like that, as we learned especially\nfrom Bohr. The results have to be regarded as the joint product of\n“system” and “apparatus”, the complete\nexperimental set-up. But the misuse of the word\n“measurement” makes it easy to forget this and then to\nexpect that the “results of measurements” should obey some\nsimple logic in which the apparatus is not mentioned. The resulting\ndifficulties soon show that any such logic is not ordinary logic. It\nis my impression that the whole vast subject of “Quantum\nLogic” has arisen in this way from the misuse of a word. I am\nconvinced that the word “measurement” has now been so\nabused that the field would be significantly advanced by banning its\nuse altogether, in favour for example of the word\n“experiment”. (Bell 1982, reprinted 1987c: 166)  \nBohmian mechanics is manifestly nonlocal. The velocity, as expressed\nin\n the guiding equation,\n of any particle of a many-particle system will typically depend upon\nthe positions of the other, possibly distant, particles whenever the\nwave function of the system is entangled, i.e., not a product of\nsingle-particle wave functions. This is true, for example, for the\nEPR-Bohm wave function, describing a pair of spin-1/2 particles in the\nsinglet state, that Bell and many others analyzed. Thus Bohmian\nmechanics makes explicit the most dramatic feature of quantum theory:\nquantum nonlocality, as discussed in Section 2.  \nIt should be emphasized that the nonlocality of Bohmian mechanics\nderives solely from the nonlocality, discussed in\n Section 2,\n built into the structure of standard quantum theory. This nonlocality\noriginates from a wave function on configuration space, an abstraction\nwhich, roughly speaking, combines—or binds—distant\nparticles into a single irreducible reality. As Bell has stressed, \nThat the guiding wave, in the general case, propagates not in ordinary\nthree-space but in a multidimensional-configuration space is the\norigin of the notorious “nonlocality” of quantum\nmechanics. It is a merit of the de Broglie-Bohm version to bring this\nout so explicitly that it cannot be ignored. (Bell 1980, reprinted\n1987c: 115)  \nThus the nonlocal velocity relation in the guiding equation is but one\naspect of the nonlocality of Bohmian mechanics. There is also the\nnonlocality, or nonseparability, implicit in the wave function itself,\nwhich is present even without the structure—actual\nconfigurations—that Bohmian mechanics adds to orthodox quantum\ntheory. As Bell has shown, using the connection between the wave\nfunction and the predictions of quantum theory about experimental\nresults, this nonlocality cannot easily be eliminated (see\n Section 2). \nThe nonlocality of Bohmian mechanics can be appreciated perhaps most\nefficiently, in all its aspects, by focusing on the\n conditional wave function.\n Suppose, for example, that in an EPR-Bohm experiment particle 1\npasses through its Stern-Gerlach magnet before particle 2 arrives at\nits magnet. Then the orientation of the Stern-Gerlach magnet for\nparticle 1 will significantly affect the conditional wave function of\nparticle 2: If the Stern-Gerlach magnet for particle 1 is oriented so\nas to “measure the \\(z\\)-component of spin”, then after\nparticle 1 has passed through its magnet the conditional wave function\nof particle 2 will be an\n eigenvector\n (or eigenstate) of the \\(z\\)-component of spin (in fact, belonging to\nthe eigenvalue that is the negative of the one “measured”\nfor particle 1), and the same thing is true for any other component of\nspin. You can dictate the kind of spin eigenstate produced\nfor particle 2 by appropriately choosing the orientation of an\narbitrarily distant magnet. As to the future behavior of particle 2,\nin particular how its magnet affects it, this of course depends very\nmuch on the character of its conditional wave function and hence the\nchoice of orientation of the distant magnet strongly influences\nit. \nThis nonlocal effect upon the conditional wave function of particle 2\nfollows from combining the standard analysis of the evolution of the\nwave function in the EPR-Bohm experiment with the definition of the\nconditional wave function. (For simplicity, we ignore permutation\nsymmetry.) Before reaching any magnets the EPR-Bohm wave function is a\nsum of two terms, corresponding to nonvanishing values for two of the\nfour possible joint spin components for the two particles. Each term\nis a product of an eigenstate for a component of spin in a given\ndirection for particle 1 with the opposite eigenstate (i.e., belonging\nto the eigenvalue that is the negative of the eigenvalue for particle\n1) for the component of spin in the same direction for particle 2.\nMoreover, by virtue of its symmetry under rotations, the EPR-Bohm wave\nfunction has the property that any component of spin, i.e., any\ndirection, can be used in this decomposition. (This property is very\ninteresting.) \nDecomposing the EPR-Bohm wave function using the component of spin in\nthe direction associated with the magnet for particle 1, the evolution\nof the wave function as particle 1 passes its magnet is easily\ngrasped: The evolution of the sum is determined (using the\n linearity of Schrödinger’s equation)\n by that of its individual terms, and the evolution of each term by\nthat of each of its factors. The evolution of the particle-1 factor\nleads to a displacement along the magnetic axis in the direction\ndetermined by the (sign of the) spin component (i.e., the eigenvalue),\nas described in the fourth paragraph of\n Section 11.\n Once this displacement has occurred (and is large enough) the\nconditional wave function for particle 2 will correspond to the term\nin the sum selected by the actual position of particle 1. In\nparticular, it will be an eigenstate of the component of spin\n“measured by” the magnet for particle 1. (For a more\nexplicit and detailed discussion see Norsen 2014.) \nThe nonlocality of Bohmian mechanics has a remarkable feature: it is\nscreened by quantum equilibrium. It is a consequence of the\n quantum equilibrium hypothesis\n that the nonlocal effects in Bohmian mechanics don’t yield\nobservable consequences that can be controlled—we can’t\nuse them to send instantaneous messages. This follows from the fact\nthat, given the quantum equilibrium hypothesis, the observable\nconsequences of Bohmian mechanics are the same as those of orthodox\nquantum theory, for which instantaneous communication based on quantum\nnonlocality is impossible (see Eberhard 1978). Valentini (1991)\nemphasizes the importance of quantum equilibrium for obscuring the\nnonlocality of Bohmian mechanics. (Valentini [2010a] has also\nsuggested the possibility of searching for and exploiting quantum\nnon-equilibrium. However, in contrast with thermodynamic\nnon-equilibrium, we have at present no idea what quantum\nnon-equilibrium, should it exist, would look like, despite claims and\narguments to the contrary.) \nLike nonrelativistic quantum theory, of which it is a version, Bohmian\nmechanics and special relativity, a central principle of physics, are\nnot compatible: Bohmian mechanics is not Lorentz invariant. Nor can it\neasily be modified to accommodate Lorentz invariance. Configurations,\ndefined by the simultaneous positions of all particles, play\ntoo crucial a role in its formulation, with\n the guiding equation\n defining an evolution on configuration space. (Lorentz\ninvariant extensions of Bohmian mechanics for a single particle,\ndescribed by the Dirac equation (Bohm & Hiley 1993; Dürr et\nal. 1999) or the Klein-Gordon equation (Berndl et al. 1996; Nikolic\n2005), can easily be achieved, though for a Klein-Gordon particle\nthere are some interesting subtleties, corresponding to what might\nseem to be a particle traveling backwards in time.) \nThis difficulty with Lorentz invariance and the nonlocality in Bohmian\nmechanics are closely related. Since quantum theory itself, by virtue\nmerely of the character of its predictions concerning EPR-Bohm\ncorrelations, is irreducibly nonlocal (see\n Section 2),\n one might expect considerable difficulty with the Lorentz invariance\nof orthodox quantum theory as well with Bohmian mechanics. For\nexample, the collapse rule of textbook quantum theory blatantly\nviolates Lorentz invariance. As a matter of fact, the intrinsic\nnonlocality of quantum theory presents formidable difficulties for the\ndevelopment of any (many-particle) Lorentz invariant formulation that\navoids the vagueness of orthodox quantum theory (see Maudlin\n1994). \nBell made a somewhat surprising evaluation of the importance of the\nproblem of Lorentz invariance. In an interview with the philosopher\nRenée Weber, not long before he died, he referred to the\nparadoxes of quantum mechanics and observed that  \nThose paradoxes are simply disposed of by the 1952 theory of Bohm,\nleaving as the question, the question of Lorentz invariance.\nSo one of my missions in life is to get people to see that if they\nwant to talk about the problems of quantum mechanics—the real\nproblems of quantum mechanics—they must be talking about Lorentz\ninvariance. (Interview with John Bell, in Weber 1989, Other Internet\nResources) \nThe most common view on this issue is that a detailed description of\nmicroscopic quantum processes, such as would be provided by a putative\nextension of Bohmian mechanics to the relativistic domain, must\nviolate Lorentz invariance. In this view Lorentz invariance in such a\ntheory would be an emergent symmetry obeyed by our\nobservations—for Bohmian mechanics a statistical consequence of\nquantum equilibrium that governs the results of quantum experiments.\nThis is the opinion of Bohm and Hiley (1993), of Holland (1993), and\nof Valentini (1997). \nHowever—unlike nonlocality—violating Lorentz invariance is\nnot inevitable. It should be possible, it seems, to construct a fully\nLorentz invariant theory that provides a detailed description of\nmicroscopic quantum processes. One way to do this is by using an\nadditional Lorentz invariant dynamical structure, for example a\nsuitable time-like 4-vector field, that permits the definition of a\nfoliation of space-time into space-like hypersurfaces providing a\nLorentz invariant notion of “evolving configuration” and\nalong which nonlocal effects are transmitted. See Dürr et al.\n1999 for a toy model. Another possibility is that a fully Lorentz\ninvariant account of quantum nonlocality can be achieved without the\ninvocation of additional structure, exploiting only what is already at\nhand, for example, the wave function of the universe or light-cone\nstructure. For more on the latter possibility, see Goldstein and\nTumulka’s model (2003), in which they reconcile relativity and\nnonlocality through the interplay of opposite arrows of time. For a\ndiscussion of the former possibility, see Dürr et al. 2014. In\nthe sort of theory discussed there, the wave function of the universe\nprovides a covariant prescription for the desired foliation. Such a\ntheory would be clearly Lorentz invariant. But it is not so clear that\nit should be regarded as relativistic. \nBe that as it may, Lorentz invariant nonlocality remains somewhat\nenigmatic. The issues are extremely subtle. For example, Bell rightly\nwould find  \ndisturbing … the impossibility of “messages” faster\nthan light, which follows from ordinary relativistic quantum mechanics\nin so far as it is unambiguous and adequate for procedures \\(we\\)\n[emphasis added] can actually perform. The exact elucidation of\nconcepts like “message” and “we”, would be a\nformidable challenge. (1981a, reprinted 1987c: 155)  \nWhile quantum equilibrium and the absolute uncertainty that it entails\n(Dürr, Goldstein, & Zanghì 1992a) may be of some help\nhere, the situation remains puzzling. \nBohmian mechanics has never been widely accepted in the mainstream of\nthe physics community. Since it is not part of the standard physics\ncurriculum, many physicists—probably the majority—are\nsimply unfamiliar with the theory and how it works. Sometimes the\ntheory is rejected without explicit discussion of reasons for\nrejection. One also finds objections that are based on simple\nmisunderstandings; among these are claims that some no-go theorem,\nsuch as von Neumann’s theorem, the Kochen-Specker theorem, or\nBell’s theorem, shows that the theory cannot work. Such\nobjections will not be dealt with here, as the reply to them will be\nobvious to those who understand the theory. In what follows only\nobjections that are not based on elementary misunderstandings will be\ndiscussed. \nA common objection is that Bohmian mechanics is too complicated or\ninelegant. To evaluate this objection one must compare the axioms of\nBohmian mechanics with those of standard quantum mechanics. To\nSchrödinger’s equation, Bohmian mechanics adds the\n guiding equation;\n standard quantum mechanics instead requires postulates about\nexperimental outcomes that can only be formulated in terms of a\ndistinction between a quantum system and the experimental apparatus.\nAnd, as noted by Hilary Putnam, \nIn Putnam ([1965]), I rejected Bohm’s interpretation for several\nreasons which no longer seem good to me. Even today, if you look at\nthe Wikipedia encyclopaedia on the Web, you will find it said that\nBohm’s theory is mathematically inelegant. Happily, I did not\ngive that reason in Putnam ([1965]), but in any case it is\nnot true. The formula for the velocity field is extremely simple: you\nhave the probability current in the theory anyway, and you take the\nvelocity vector to be proportional to the current. There is nothing\nparticularly inelegant about that; if anything, it is remarkably\nelegant! (2005: 262)  \nOne frequent objection is that Bohmian mechanics, since it makes\nprecisely the same predictions as standard quantum mechanics (insofar\nas the predictions of standard quantum mechanics are unambiguous), is\nnot a distinct theory but merely a reformulation of standard quantum\ntheory. In this vein, Heisenberg wrote, \nBohm’s interpretation cannot be refuted by experiment, and this\nis true of all the counter-proposals in the first group. From the\nfundamentally “positivistic” (it would perhaps be better\nto say “purely physical”) standpoint, we are thus\nconcerned not with counter-proposals to the Copenhagen interpretation,\nbut with its exact repetition in a different language. (Heisenberg\n1955: 18)  \nMore recently, Sir Anthony Leggett has echoed this charge. Referring\nto the measurement problem, he says that Bohmian mechanics provides\n“little more than verbal window dressing of the basic\nparadox” (Leggett 2005: 871). And in connection with the\ndouble-slit experiment, he writes, \nNo experimental consequences are drawn from [the assumption of\ndefinite particle trajectories] other than the standard predictions of\nthe QM formalism, so whether one regards it as a substantive\nresolution of the apparent paradox or as little more than a\nreformulation of it is no doubt a matter of personal taste (the\npresent author inclines towards the latter point of view). (Leggett\n2002: R419)  \nNow Bohmian mechanics and standard quantum mechanics provide clearly\ndifferent descriptions of what is happening on the microscopic quantum\nlevel. So it is only with a purely instrumental attitude towards\nscientific theories that Bohmian mechanics and standard quantum\nmechanics can possibly be regarded as different formulations of\nexactly the same theory. But even if they were, why would this be an\nobjection to Bohmian mechanics? Even if they were, we should still ask\nwhich of the two formulations is superior. Those impressed by the\n“not-a-distinct-theory” objection presumably give\nconsiderable weight to the fact that standard quantum mechanics came\nfirst. Supporters of Bohmian mechanics give more weight to its greater\nsimplicity and clarity. \nThe position of Leggett, however, is very difficult to understand.\nThere should be no measurement problem for a physicist with a purely\ninstrumentalist understanding of quantum mechanics. But for more than\nthirty years Leggett has forcefully argued that quantum mechanics\nindeed suffers from the measurement problem. For Leggett the problem\nis so serious that it has led him to suggest that quantum mechanics\nmight fail on the macroscopic level. Thus Leggett is no\ninstrumentalist, and it is hard to understand why he so cavalierly\ndismisses a theory like Bohmian mechanics that obviously doesn’t\nsuffer from the measurement problem, with which he has been so long\nconcerned.  \nSir Roger Penrose also seems to have doubts as to whether Bohmian\nmechanics indeed resolves the measurement problem. He writes that \nit seems to me that some measure of scale is indeed needed, for\ndefining when classical-like behaviour begins to take over from\nsmall-scale quantum activity. In common with the other quantum\nontologies in which no measurable deviations from standard quantum\nmechanics is expected, the point of view (e) [Bohmian mechanics] does\nnot possess such a scale measure, so I do not see that it can\nadequately address the paradox of Schrödinger’s cat. (2005:\n811)  \nBut contrary to what he writes, his real concern seems to be with the\nemergence of classical behavior, and not with the measurement problem\nper se. With regard to this, we note that the Bohmian\nevolution of particles, which is always governed by the wave function\nand is always fundamentally quantum, turns out to be approximately\nclassical when the relevant de Broglie wave length, determined in part\nby the wave function, is much smaller than the scale on which the\npotential energy term in Schrödinger’s equation varies (see\nAllori et al., 2002). Under normal circumstances this condition will\nbe satisfied for the center of mass motion of a macroscopic\nobject. \nIt is perhaps worth mentioning that despite the empirical equivalence\nbetween Bohmian mechanics and orthodox quantum theory, there are a\nvariety of experiments and experimental issues that don’t fit\ncomfortably within the standard quantum formalism but are easily\nhandled by Bohmian mechanics. Among these are dwell and tunneling\ntimes (Leavens 1996), escape times and escape positions (Daumer et al.\n1997b), scattering theory (Dürr et al., 2000), and quantum chaos\n(Cushing 1994; Dürr, Goldstein, & Zanghì 1992b).\nEspecially problematical from an orthodox perspective is quantum\ncosmology, for which the relevant quantum system is the entire\nuniverse, and hence there is no observer outside the system to cause\ncollapse of the wave function upon measurement. In this setting\nBohmian models have clarified the issue of the inevitability of the\npresence of singularities in theories of quantum gravity (Falciano,\nPinto-Neto, & Struyve 2015). Moreover, the additional resources\npresent in Bohmian mechanics, in particular the notion of the\nconditional wave function defined in Section 8, have been useful for\nthe development of approximation schemes for dealing with practical\nquantum applications (Oriols & Mompart 2012). \nAnother claim that has become popular in recent years is that Bohmian\nmechanics is an Everettian, or “many worlds”,\ninterpretation in disguise (see entry on\n the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics\n for an overview of such interpretations). The idea is that Bohmians,\nlike Everettians, must take the wave-function as physically real.\nMoreover, since Bohmian mechanics involves no wave-function collapse\n(for the wave function of the universe), all of the branches of the\nwave function, and not just the one that happens to be occupied by the\nactual particle configuration, persist. These branches are those that\nEverettians regard as representing parallel worlds. As David Deutsch\nexpresses the charge, \nthe “unoccupied grooves” must be physically real. Moreover\nthey obey the same laws of physics as the “occupied\ngroove” that is supposed to be “the” universe. But\nthat is just another way of saying that they are universes too.\n… In short, pilot-wave theories are parallel-universes theories\nin a state of chronic denial. (Deutsch 1996: 225)  \nSee Brown and Wallace (2005) for an extended version of this argument.\nNot surprisingly, Bohmians do not agree that the branches of the wave\nfunction should be construed as representing worlds. For one Bohmian\nresponse, see Maudlin (2010). Other Bohmian responses have been given\nby Lewis (2007) and Valentini (2010b).  \nThe claim of Deutsch, Brown, and Wallace is of a novel character that\nwe should perhaps pause to examine. On the one hand, for anyone who,\nlike Wallace, accepts the viability of a functionalist many-worlds\nunderstanding of quantum mechanics—and in particular accepts\nthat it follows as a matter of functional and structural analysis that\nwhen the wave function develops suitable complex patterns these ipso\nfacto describe what we should regard as worlds—the claim should\nbe compelling. On the other hand, for those who reject the functional\nanalysis and regard many worlds as ontologically inadequate (see\nMaudlin 2010), or who, like Vaidman (see the SEP entry on the\n many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics),\n accepts many worlds on non-functionalist grounds, the claim should\nseem empty. In other words, one has basically to have already accepted\na strong version of many worlds and already rejected Bohm in order to\nfeel the force of the claim.  \nAnother interesting aspect of the claim is this: It seems that one\ncould consider, at least as a logical possibility, a world consisting\nof particles moving according to some well-defined equations of\nmotion, and in particular according to the equations of Bohmian\nmechanics. It seems entirely implausible that there should be a\nlogical problem with doing so. We should be extremely sceptical of any\nargument, like the claim of Deutsch, Brown, and Wallace, that suggests\nthat there is. Thus what, in defense of many worlds, Deutsch, Brown,\nand Wallace present as an objection to Bohmian mechanics should\nperhaps be regarded instead as an objection to many worlds itself. \nThere is one striking feature of Bohmian mechanics that is often\npresented as an objection: in Bohmian mechanics the wave function acts\nupon the positions of the particles but, evolving as it does\nautonomously via Schrödinger’s equation, it is not acted\nupon by the particles. This is regarded by some Bohmians, not as an\nobjectionable feature of the theory, but as an important clue about\nthe meaning of the quantum-mechanical wave function. Dürr,\nGoldstein, & Zanghì (1997) and Goldstein & Teufel\n(2001) discuss this point and suggest that from a deeper perspective\nthan afforded by standard Bohmian mechanics or quantum theory, the\nwave function should be regarded as nomological, as an object for\nconveniently expressing the law of motion somewhat analogous to the\nHamiltonian in classical mechanics, and that a time-dependent\nSchrödinger-type equation, from this deeper (cosmological)\nperspective, is merely phenomenological. \nBohmian mechanics does not account for phenomena such as particle\ncreation and annihilation characteristic of quantum field theory. This\nis not an objection to Bohmian mechanics but merely a recognition that\nquantum field theory explains a great deal more than does\nnonrelativistic quantum mechanics, whether in orthodox or Bohmian\nform. It does, however, underline the need to find an adequate, if not\ncompelling, Bohmian version of quantum field theory, and of gauge\ntheories in particular. Some rather tentative steps in this direction\ncan be found in Bohm & Hiley 1993, Holland 1993, Bell 1987b), and\nin some of the articles in Cushing, Fine, & Goldstein 1996. A\ncrucial issue is whether a quantum field theory is fundamentally about\nfields or particles—or something else entirely. While the most\ncommon choice is fields (see Struyve 2010 for an assessment of a\nvariety of possibilities), Bell’s is particles. His proposal is\nin fact the basis of a canonical extension of Bohmian mechanics to\ngeneral quantum field theories, and these “Bell-type quantum\nfield theories” (Dürr et al. 2004 and 2005) describe a\nstochastic evolution of particles that involves particle creation and\nannihilation. (For a general discussion of this issue, and of the\npoint and value of Bohmian mechanics, see the exchange of letters\nbetween Goldstein and Weinberg by following the link provided in the\n Other Internet Resources\n section below.) \nFor an accessible introduction to Bohmian mechanics see Bricmont\n2016.","contact.mail":"oldstein@math.rutgers.edu","contact.domain":"math.rutgers.edu"}]
