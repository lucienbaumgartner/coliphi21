The name is somewhat misleading, for in a single\nsection of his Pensées, Pascal apparently presents at\nleast three such arguments, each of which might be called a\n‘wager’—it is only the final of these that is\ntraditionally referred to as “Pascal’s Wager”. We\nfind in it the extraordinary confluence of several important strands\nof thought: the justification of theism; probability theory and\ndecision theory, used here for almost the first time in history;\npragmatism; voluntarism (the thesis that belief is a matter of the\nwill); and the use of the concept of infinity. \n\n\n\nWe will begin with some brief stage-setting: some historical\nbackground, some of the basics of decision theory, and some of the\nexegetical problems that the Pensées pose. Then we will\nfollow the text to extract three main arguments. The bulk of the\nliterature addresses the third of these arguments, as will the bulk of\nour discussion here. Some of the more technical and scholarly aspects\nof our discussion will be relegated to lengthy footnotes, to which\nthere are links for the interested reader. All quotations are from\n§233 of Pensées (1910, Trotter translation), the\n‘thought’ whose heading is\n“Infinite—nothing”.\n\n\n\nIt is important to contrast Pascal’s argument with various putative\n‘proofs’ of the existence of God that had come before it.\nAnselm’s ontological argument, Aquinas’ ‘five ways’,\nDescartes’ ontological and cosmological arguments, and so on, purport\nto prove that God exists. Pascal is\napparently unimpressed by such attempted justifications of theism:\n“Endeavour … to convince yourself, not by increase of proofs of\nGod…” Indeed, he concedes that “we do not know if He is …”.\nPascal’s project, then, is radically different: he seeks to provide\nprudential reasons for believing in God. To put it simply, we\nshould wager that God exists because it is the best bet. Ryan\n1994 finds precursors to this line of reasoning in the writings of\nPlato, Arnobius, Lactantius, and others; we might add Ghazali to his\nlist—see Palacios 1920. But what is distinctive is Pascal’s\nexplicitly decision-theoretic formulation of the reasoning. In fact,\nHacking 1975 describes the Wager as “the first well-understood\ncontribution to decision theory” (viii). Thus, we should pause briefly\nto review some of the basics of that theory.  \n\nIn any decision problem, the way the world is, and what an agent\ndoes, together determine an outcome for the agent. We may assign\nutilities to such outcomes, numbers that represent the degree\nto which the agent values them. It is typical to present these numbers\nin a decision matrix, with the columns corresponding to the various\nrelevant states of the world, and the rows corresponding to the various\npossible actions that the agent can perform. \n\nIn decisions under uncertainty, nothing more is\ngiven—in particular, the agent does not assign subjective\nprobabilities to the states of the world. Still, sometimes rationality\ndictates a unique decision nonetheless. Consider, for example, a case\nthat will be particularly relevant here. Suppose that you have two\npossible actions, \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\), and the worst outcome\nassociated with \\(A_1\\) is at least as good as the best outcome associated\nwith \\(A_2\\); suppose also that in at least one state of the world,\n\\(A_1\\)’s outcome is strictly better than \\(A_2\\)’s. Let us say in\nthat case that \\(A_1\\)\nsuperdominates \\(A_2\\). Then rationality seems to require you to\nperform \\(A_1\\).[1] \n\nIn decisions under risk, the agent assigns subjective\nprobabilities to the various states of the world. Assume that the\nstates of the world are independent of what the agent does. A figure of\nmerit called the expected utility, or the expectation\nof a given action can be calculated by a simple formula: for each\nstate, multiply the utility that the action produces in that state by\nthe state’s probability; then, add these numbers. According to decision\ntheory, rationality requires you to perform the action of maximum\nexpected utility (if there is one). \n\nExample. Suppose that the utility of money is\nlinear in number of dollars: you value money at exactly its face value.\nSuppose that you have the option of paying a dollar to play a game in\nwhich there is an equal chance of returning nothing, and returning\nthree dollars. The expectation of the game itself is \n\nso the expectation of paying a dollar for certain, then playing, is  \n\nThis exceeds the expectation of not playing (namely 0), so you should\nplay. On the other hand, if the game gave an equal chance of returning\nnothing, and returning two dollars, then its expectation would be:  \n\nThen consistent with decision theory, you could either pay the dollar\nto play, or refuse to play, for either way your overall expectation\nwould be 0.  \n\nConsiderations such as these will play a crucial role in Pascal’s\narguments. It should be admitted that there are certain exegetical\nproblems in presenting these arguments. Pascal never finished the\nPensées, but rather left them in the form of notes of\nvarious sizes pinned together. Hacking 1972 describes the\n“Infinite—nothing” as consisting of “two pieces of paper covered\non both sides by handwriting going in all directions, full of erasures,\ncorrections, insertions, and afterthoughts”\n (24).[2]\n This may explain why certain passages are notoriously difficult to\ninterpret, as we will see. Furthermore, our formulation of the\narguments in the parlance of modern Bayesian decision theory might\nappear somewhat anachronistic. For example, Pascal did not\ndistinguish between what we would now call objective and\nsubjective probability, although it is clear that it is the\nlatter that is relevant to his arguments. To some extent, “Pascal’s\nWager” now has a life of its own, and our presentation of it here is\nperfectly standard. Still, we will closely follow Pascal’s text,\nsupporting our reading of his arguments as much as possible. (See also Golding 1994 for another detailed analysis of Pascal’s reasoning, broken down into more steps than the presentation here.) \n\nThere is the further problem of dividing the\nInfinite-nothing into separate arguments. We will locate three\narguments that each conclude that rationality requires you to wager for\nGod, although they interleave in the\n text.[3]\n Finally, there is some disagreement over just what “wagering for God”\ninvolves—is it believing in God, or merely\nengendering belief? We will conclude with a discussion of what Pascal\nmeant by this. \n\nPascal maintains that we are incapable of knowing whether God exists or\nnot, yet we must “wager” one way or the other. Reason cannot settle\nwhich way we should incline, but a consideration of the relevant\noutcomes supposedly can. Here is the first key passage:  \n\nThere are exegetical problems already here, partly because Pascal\nappears to contradict himself. He speaks of “the true” as\nsomething that you can “lose”, and “error” as\nsomething “to shun”. Yet he goes on to claim that if you\nlose the wager that God is, then “you lose\nnothing”. Surely in that case you “lose the true”,\nwhich is just to say that you have made an error. Pascal believes, of\ncourse, that the existence of God is “the \ntrue”—but that is not something that he can appeal to in this\nargument. Moreover, it is not because “you must of necessity\nchoose” that “your reason is no more shocked in choosing\none rather than the other”. Rather, by Pascal’s own account, it\nis because “[r]eason can decide nothing here”. (If it\ncould, then it might well be shocked—namely, if you chose in a\nway contrary to it.)  \n\nFollowing McClennen 1994, Pascal’s argument seems to be best\ncaptured as presenting the following decision matrix: \n\nWagering for God superdominates wagering against God: the worst\noutcome associated with wagering for God (status quo) is at least as\ngood as the best outcome associated with wagering against God (status\nquo); and if God exists, the result of wagering for God is strictly\nbetter than the result of wagering against God. (The fact that the\nresult is much better does not matter yet.) Pascal draws the\nconclusion at this point that you should wager for\nGod. \n\nWithout any assumption about your probability assignment to God’s\nexistence, the argument is invalid. Rationality does not\nrequire you to wager for God if you assign probability 0 to God\nexisting, as a strict atheist might. And Pascal does not explicitly rule this possibility out\nuntil a later passage, when he assumes that you assign positive\nprobability to God’s existence; yet this argument is presented as if it\nis self-contained. His claim that “[r]eason can decide nothing here”\nmay suggest that Pascal regards this as a decision under uncertainty,\nwhich is to assume that you do not assign probability at all\nto God’s existence. If that is a further premise, then the argument is apparently\nvalid; but that premise contradicts his subsequent assumption that you\nassign positive probability. See McClennen for a reading of this\nargument as a decision under uncertainty. \n\nPascal appears to be aware of a further objection to this argument,\nfor he immediately imagines an opponent replying: \n\nThe thought seems to be that if I wager for God, and God does not\nexist, then I really do lose something. In fact, Pascal himself speaks\nof staking something when one wagers for God, which\npresumably one loses if God does not exist. (We have already mentioned\n‘the true’ as one such thing; Pascal also seems to regard\none’s worldly life as another.) In that case, the matrix is mistaken\nin presenting the two outcomes under ‘God does not exist’\nas if they were the same, and we do not have a case of superdominance\nafter all.  \n\nPascal addresses this at once in his second argument, which we will\ndiscuss only briefly, as it can be thought of as just a prelude to the\nmain argument. \n\nHe continues:  \n\nHis hypothetically speaking of “two lives” and\n“three lives” may strike one as odd. It is helpful to bear\nin mind Pascal’s interest in gambling (which after all provided the\ninitial motivation for his study of probability) and to take the\ngambling model quite seriously here. Indeed, the Wager is permeated\nwith gambling metaphors: “game”, “stake”,\n“heads or tails”, “cards” and, of course,\n“wager”. Now, recall our calculation of the expectations\nof the two dollar and three dollar gambles. Pascal apparently assumes\nnow that utility is linear in number of lives, that wagering\nfor God costs “one life”, and then reasons analogously to\nthe way we did in our expectation calculations above! This is, as it were, a warm-up. Since wagering for\nGod is rationally required even in the hypothetical case in which one\nof the prizes is three lives, then all the more it is rationally\nrequired in the actual case, in which one of the prizes is\nan eternity of life (salvation).  \n\nSo Pascal has now made two striking assumptions: \n\nMorris 1994 is sympathetic to (1), while Hacking 1972 finds it “a\nmonstrous premiss”. One way to defend it is via the classical\ninterpretation of probability, according to which all possibilities are\ngiven equal weight. The interpretation seems attractive for various gambling games, which by design involve an evidential symmetry with respect to their outcomes; and Pascal even likens God’s existence to a coin toss, evidentially speaking. However, unless more is said, the interpretation\nyields implausible, and even contradictory results. (You have a\none-in-a-million chance of winning the lottery; but either you win the\nlottery or you don’t, so each of these possibilities has probability\n1/2?!) Pascal’s argument for (1) is presumably that “[r]eason can\ndecide nothing here”. (In the lottery ticket case, reason can decide\nsomething.) But it is not clear that complete ignorance\nshould be modeled as sharp indifference. Morris imagines, rather, an\nagent who does have evidence for and against the existence of God, but\nit is equally balanced. In any case, it \\(is\\) clear that there\nare people in Pascal’s audience who do not assign probability 1/2 to\nGod’s existence. This argument, then, does not speak to them.  \n\nHowever, Pascal realizes that the value of 1/2 actually plays no\nreal role in the argument, thanks to (2). This brings us to the third,\nand by far the most important, of his arguments. \n\nWe continue the quotation.  \n\nAgain this passage is difficult to understand completely. Pascal’s talk\nof winning two, or three, lives is a little misleading. By his own\ndecision theoretic lights, you would not act stupidly “by\nrefusing to stake one life against three at a game in which out of an\ninfinity of chances there is one for you”—in fact, you should not\nstake more than an infinitesimal amount in that case (an amount that is\nbigger than 0, but smaller than every positive real number). The point,\nrather, is that the prospective prize is “an infinity of an infinitely\nhappy life”. In short, if God exists, then wagering for God results in\ninfinite utility.  \n\nWhat about the utilities for the other possible outcomes? There is\nsome dispute over the utility of “misery”. Hacking interprets this as\n“damnation”, and Pascal does later speak of “hell” as the outcome in\nthis case. Martin 1983 among others assigns this a value of\nnegative infinity. Sobel 1996, on the other hand, is one\nauthor who takes this value to be finite. There is some textual support\nfor this reading: “The justice of God must be vast like His compassion.\nNow justice to the outcast is less vast … than mercy towards the\nelect”. As for the utilities of the outcomes associated with God’s\nnon-existence, Pascal tells us that “what you stake is finite”. This\nsuggests that whatever these values are, they are finite. \n\nPascal’s guiding insight is that the argument from expectation goes\nthrough equally well whatever your probability for God’s\nexistence is, provided that it is non-zero and finite\n(non-infinitesimal)—“a chance of gain against a finite number\nof chances of\n loss”.[4] \n\nPascal’s assumptions about utilities and probabilities are now in\nplace. In another landmark moment in this passage, he next presents a\nformulation of expected utility theory. When gambling, “every\nplayer stakes a certainty to gain an uncertainty, and yet he stakes a\nfinite certainty to gain a finite uncertainty, without transgressing\nagainst reason”. How much, then, should a player be prepared to\nstake without transgressing against reason? Here is Pascal’s answer:\n“… the uncertainty of the gain is proportioned to the\ncertainty of the stake according to the proportion of the chances of\ngain and loss …” It takes some work to show that this\nyields expected utility theory’s answer exactly, but it is work well\nworth doing for its historical \n importance.[5]\n(The interested reader can see this work done at \n footnote 5.) \n\nLet us now gather together all of these points into a single\nargument. We can think of Pascal’s Wager as having three premises: the\nfirst concerns the decision matrix of rewards, the second concerns the\nprobability that you should give to God’s existence, and the third is a\nmaxim about rational decision-making. Specifically: Either God exists or God does not exist, and you can either wager\nfor God or wager against God. The utilities of the relevant possible\noutcomes are as follows, where \\(f_1, f_2\\), and\n\\(f_3\\) are numbers whose values are not specified beyond the\nrequirement that they be finite:  \n\nWe have a decision under risk, with probabilities assigned to the ways the world could be, and utilities assigned to the outcomes. In particular, we represent the infinite utility associated with salvation as ‘\\(\\infty\\)’. We assume that the real line is extended to include the element ‘\\(\\infty\\)’, and that the basic arithmetical operations are extended as follows: \nFor all real numbers \\(r\\): \\(\\infty + r = \\infty\\).\n\nFor all real numbers \\(r\\): \\(\\infty \\times r = \\infty\\) if \\(r \\gt 0\\).\n \nThe first conclusion seems to\nfollow from the usual calculations of expected utility\n(where \\(p\\) is your positive, non-infinitesimal probability for\nGod’s existence):  \n\nThat is, your expected utility of belief in God is infinite—as\nPascal puts it, “our proposition is of infinite force”. On\nthe other hand, your expected utility of wagering against God is  \n\nThis is\n finite.[6]\n By premise 3, rationality requires\nyou to perform the act of maximum expected utility. Therefore,\nrationality requires you to wager for God.  \n\nWe now survey some of the main objections to the argument. \n\nHere the objections are manifold. Most of them can be stated\nquickly, but we will give special attention to what has generally been\nregarded as the most important of them, ‘the many Gods\nobjection’ (see also the link to footnote 7). \n\n1. Different matrices for different people. The argument\nassumes that the same decision matrix applies to everybody. However,\nperhaps the relevant rewards are different for different people.\nPerhaps, for example, there is a predestined infinite reward for the\nChosen, whatever they do, and finite utility for the rest, as Mackie\n1982 suggests. Or maybe the prospect of salvation appeals more to some\npeople than to others, as Swinburne 1969 has noted. \n\nEven granting that a single \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrix applies to\neverybody, one might dispute the values that enter into it. This\nbrings us to the next two objections. \n\n2. The utility of salvation could not be infinite. One might\nargue that the very notion of infinite utility is suspect—see\nfor example Jeffrey 1983 and McClennen\n 1994.[7]\n Hence, the\nobjection continues, whatever the utility of salvation might be, it\nmust be finite. Strict finitists, who are suspicious of the notion of\ninfinity in general, will agree—see Dummett 1978 and Wright\n1987. Or perhaps the notion of infinite utility makes sense, but an\ninfinite reward could only be finitely appreciated by a human\nbeing. \n\n3. There should be more than one infinity in the matrix.  There\nare also critics of the Wager who, far from objecting to infinite\nutilities, want to see more of them in the matrix. For\nexample, it might be thought that a forgiving God would bestow\ninfinite utility upon wagerers-for and wagerers-against\nalike—Rescher 1985 is one author who entertains this\npossibility. Or it might be thought that, on the contrary, wagering\nagainst an existent God results in negative infinite\nutility. (As we have noted, some authors read Pascal himself as saying\nas much.) Either way, \\(f_2\\) is not really finite at all, but\n\\(\\infty\\) or \\(-\\infty\\) as the case may be.  And perhaps \\(f_1\\) and\n\\(f_3\\) could be \\(\\infty\\) or \\(-\\infty\\). Suppose, for instance,\nthat God does not exist, but that we are reincarnated ad\ninfinitum, and that the total utility we receive is an infinite\nsum that diverges to infinity or to negative infinity. \n\n4. The matrix should have more rows. Perhaps there is more\nthan one way to wager for God, and the rewards that God bestows vary\naccordingly. For instance, God might not reward infinitely those who\nstrive to believe in Him only for the very mercenary reasons that\nPascal gives, as James 1956 has observed. One could also imagine\ndistinguishing belief based on faith from belief based on evidential\nreasons, and posit different rewards in each case. \n\n5. The matrix should have more columns: the many Gods\nobjection. If Pascal is really right that reason can decide nothing\nhere, then it would seem that various other theistic hypotheses are\nalso live options. Pascal presumably had in mind the Catholic\nconception of God—let us suppose that this is the God who\neither ‘exists’ or ‘does not exist’. By\nexcluded middle, this is a partition. The objection, then, is that the\npartition is not sufficiently fine-grained, and the ‘(Catholic)\nGod does not exist’ column really subdivides into various\nother theistic hypotheses. The objection could equally run\nthat Pascal’s argument ‘proves too much’: by parallel\nreasoning we can ‘show’ that rationality requires believing\nin various incompatible theistic hypotheses. As Diderot (1746) puts\nthe point: “An Imam could reason just as well this\n way”.[8] \n\nSince then, the point has been presented again and refined in various\nways. Mackie 1982 writes, “the church within which alone salvation is\nto be found is not necessarily the Church of Rome, but perhaps that of\nthe Anabaptists or the Mormons or the Muslim Sunnis or the worshippers\nof Kali or of Odin” (203). Cargile 1966 shows just how easy it is to\nmultiply theistic hypotheses: for each real number \\(x\\), consider\nthe God who prefers contemplating \\(x\\) more than any other\nactivity. It seems, then, that such ‘alternative gods’ are\na dime a dozen—or \\(\\aleph_1\\), for that matter. In response, some authors argue that in such a competition among\nvarious possible deities for one’s belief, some are more probable than\nothers. Although there may be ties among the expected \nutilities—all infinite—for believing in various ones among them,\ntheir respective probabilities can be used as\ntie-breakers. Schlesinger (1994, 90) offers this principle: “In\ncases where the mathematical expectations are infinite, the criterion for\nchoosing the outcome to bet on is its probability”. (Note that this\nprinciple is not found in the Wager itself, although it might be regarded as\na friendly addition.) Are there\nreasons, then, for assigning higher probability to some Gods than\nothers? Jordan (1994a, 107) suggests that some outlandish theistic\nhypotheses may be dismissed for having “no backing of\ntradition”. Similarly, Schlesinger maintains that Pascal is\naddressing readers who “have a notion of what genuine religion\nis about” (88), and we might take that to suggest that Cargile’s\nimagined Gods, for example, may be correspondingly assigned lower\nprobability than Pascal’s God. Lycan and Schlesinger 1989 give more\ntheoretical reasons for favoring Pascal’s God over others in one’s\nprobability assignments. They begin by noting the familiar problem in\nscience of underdetermination of theory by evidence. Faced with a\nmultiplicity of theories that all fit the observed data equally well,\nwe favor the simplest such theory. They go on to argue that simplicity\nconsiderations similarly favor a conception of God as\n“absolutely perfect”, “which is theologically unique\nin that it implies all the other predicates traditionally ascribed to\nGod” (104), and we may add that this conception is\nPascal’s. Conceptions of rival Gods, by contrast, leave open various\nquestions about their nature, the answering of which would detract\nfrom their simplicity, and thus their probability. Finally, Bartha 2012 models one’s probability assignments to\nvarious theistic hypotheses as evolving over time according to a\n‘deliberational dynamics’ somewhat analogous to the\ndynamics of evolution by natural selection. So understood, Pascal’s\nWager is not a single decision, but rather a sequence of decisions in\nwhich one’s probabilities update sequentially in proportion to how\nchoiceworthy each God appeared to be in the previous round. (This\nrelies on a sophisticated handling of infinite utilities in terms of\nutility ratios given in his 2007; see below.) He argues that a given\nprobability assignment is choiceworthy only if it is an equilibrium of\nthis deliberational dynamics. He shows that certain assignments are\nchoiceworthy by this criterion, thus providing a kind of vindication\nof Pascal against the many Gods objection. \n\nThere are four sorts of problem for this premise. The first two are\nstraightforward; the second two are more technical, and can be found by\nfollowing the link to footnote 9. \n\n1. Undefined probability for God’s existence. Premise 1\npresupposes that you should have a probability for God’s\nexistence in the first place. However, perhaps you could rationally\nfail to assign it a probability—your probability that\nGod exists could remain undefined. We cannot enter here into\nthe thorny issues concerning the attribution of probabilities to\nagents. But there is some support for this response even in Pascal’s\nown text, again at the pivotal claim that “[r]eason can decide nothing\nhere. There is an infinite chaos which separated us. A game is being\nplayed at the extremity of this infinite distance where heads or tails\nwill turn up…” The thought could be that any probability assignment\nis inconsistent with a state of “epistemic nullity” (in Morris’ 1986\nphrase): to assign a probability at all—even 1/2—to\nGod’s existence is to feign having evidence that one in fact totally\nlacks. For unlike a coin that we know to be fair, this metaphorical\n‘coin’ is ‘infinitely far’ from us, hence\napparently completely unknown to us. Perhaps, then, rationality\nactually requires us to refrain from assigning a probability\nto God’s existence (in which case at least the Argument from\nSuperdominance would apparently be valid). Or perhaps rationality does not require\nit, but at least permits it. Either way, the Wager would not\neven get off the ground. \n\n2. Zero probability for God’s existence. Strict atheists may\ninsist on the rationality of a probability assignment of 0, as Oppy\n1990 among others points out. For example, they may contend that reason\nalone can settle that God does not exist, perhaps by arguing\nthat the very notion of an omniscient, omnipotent, omnibenevolent being\nis contradictory. Or a Bayesian might hold that rationality places no\nconstraint on probabilistic judgments beyond coherence (or conformity\nto the probability calculus). Then as long as the strict atheist\nassigns probability 1 to God’s non-existence alongside his or her\nassignment of 0 to God’s existence, no norm of rationality has been\nviolated. Furthermore, an assignment of \\(p = 0\\) would clearly block the route to\nPascal’s conclusion, under the usual assumption that \n For then the expectation calculations become: \nAnd nothing in the argument implies that \\(f_1 \\gt f_3\\). (Indeed,\nthis inequality is questionable, as even Pascal seems to allow.) In\nshort, Pascal’s wager has no pull on strict\n atheists.[9] \n\nFinally, one could question Pascal’s decision theoretic assumption\nthat rationality requires one to perform the act of maximum expected\nutility (when there is one). Now perhaps this is an analytic\ntruth, in which case we could grant it to Pascal without further\ndiscussion—perhaps it is constitutive of rationality\nto maximize expectation, as some might say. But this premise has met\nserious objections. The Allais 1953 and Ellsberg 1961 paradoxes, for\nexample, are said to show that maximizing expectation can lead one to\nperform intuitively sub-optimal actions. So too the St. Petersburg\nparadox, in which it is supposedly absurd that one should be prepared\nto pay any finite amount to play a game with infinite expectation.\n(That paradox is particularly apposite\n here.)[10] \n Various refinements of expected utility theory have been suggested as\na result of such problems. For example, we might consider expected\ndifferences between the pay-offs of options, and prefer one\noption to another if and only if the expected difference of the former\nrelative to the latter is positive—see Hájek and Nover 2006,\nHájek 2006, Colyvan 2008, and Colyvan & Hájek 2016. Or we might consider\nsuitably defined utility ratios, and prefer one option to\nanother if and only if the utility ratio of the former relative to the\nlatter is greater than 1—see Bartha 2007. If we either admit\nrefinements of traditional expected utility theory, or are pluralistic\nabout our decision rules, then premise 3 is apparently false as it\nstands. Nonetheless, the door is opened to some suitable reformulation\nof it that might serve Pascal’s purposes. Indeed, Bartha argues that\nhis ratio-based reformulation answers some of the most pressing\nobjections to the Wager that turn on its invocation of infinite\nutility. \n\nFinally, one might distinguish between practical\nrationality and theoretical rationality. One could then\nconcede that practical rationality requires you to maximize expected\nutility, while insisting that theoretical rationality might require\nsomething else of you—say, proportioning belief to the amount\nof evidence available. This objection is especially relevant, since\nPascal admits that perhaps you “must renounce reason” in order to\nfollow his advice. But when these two sides of rationality pull in\nopposite directions, as they apparently can here, it is not obvious\nthat practical rationality should take precedence. (For a discussion of\npragmatic, as opposed to theoretical, reasons for belief, see Foley\n1994.) \n\nA number of authors who have been otherwise critical of the Wager\nhave explicitly conceded that the Wager is valid—e.g. Mackie\n1982, Rescher 1985, Mougin and Sober 1994, and most emphatically,\nHacking 1972. That is, these authors agree with Pascal that wagering\nfor God really is rationally mandated by Pascal’s decision matrix in\ntandem with positive probability for God’s existence, and the decision\ntheoretic account of rational action. \n\nHowever, Duff 1986 and Hájek 2003 argue that the argument is\nin fact invalid. Their point is that there are strategies besides\nwagering for God that also have infinite expectation—namely,\nmixed strategies, whereby you do not wager for or against God\noutright, but rather choose which of these actions to perform on the\nbasis of the outcome of some chance device. Consider the mixed\nstrategy: “Toss a fair coin: heads, you wager for God; tails, you wager\nagainst God”. By Pascal’s lights, with probability 1/2 your expectation\nwill be infinite, and with probability 1/2 it will be finite. The\nexpectation of the entire strategy is: \n\nThat is, the ‘coin toss’ strategy has the same expectation\nas outright wagering for God. But the probability 1/2 was incidental to\nthe result. Any mixed strategy that gives positive and finite\nprobability to wagering for God will likewise have infinite\nexpectation: “wager for God iff a fair die lands 6”, “wager for God iff\nyour lottery ticket wins”, “wager for God iff a meteor quantum tunnels\nits way through the side of your house”, and so on.  \n\nIt can be argued that the problem is still worse than this, though, for there is a sense\nin which anything that you do might be regarded as a mixed\nstrategy between wagering for God, and wagering against God, with\nsuitable probability weights given to each. Suppose that you choose to\nignore the Wager, and to go and have a hamburger instead. Still, you\nmay well assign positive and finite probability to your winding up\nwagering for God nonetheless; and this probability multiplied by\ninfinity again gives infinity. So ignoring the Wager and having a\nhamburger has the same expectation as outright wagering for God. Even\nworse, suppose that you focus all your energy into avoiding\nbelief in God. Still, you may well assign positive and finite\nprobability to your efforts failing, with the result that you wager for\nGod nonetheless. In that case again, your expectation is infinite\nagain. So even if rationality requires you to perform the act of\nmaximum expected utility when there is one, here there isn’t one.\nRather, there is a many-way tie for first place, as it\n were. All hell breaks loose: anything you might do is maximally \n good by expected utility lights![11] \nMonton 2011 defends Pascal’s Wager against this line of\nobjection. He argues that an atheist or agnostic has more than one\nopportunity to follow a mixed strategy. Returning to the first example\nof one, suppose that the fair coin lands tails. Monton’s thought is\nthat your expected utility now changes; it is no longer infinite, but\nrather that of an atheist or agnostic who has no prospect of the\ninfinite reward for wagering for God. You are back to where you\nstarted. But since it was rational for you to follow the mixed\nstrategy the first time, it is rational for you to follow it again\nnow—that is, to toss the coin again. And if it lands tails\nagain, it is rational for you to toss the coin again … With\nprobability 1, the coin will land heads eventually, and from that\npoint on you will wager for God. Similar reasoning applies to wagering\nfor God just in case an n-sided die lands 1 (say): with probability 1\nthe die will eventually land 1, so if you repeatedly base your mixed\nstrategy on the die, with probability 1 you will wind up wagering for\nGod after a finite number of rolls. Robertson 2012 replies that not\nall such mixed strategies are (probabilistically) guaranteed to lead\nto your wagering for God in the long run: not ones in which the\nprobability of wagering for God decreases sufficiently fast on\nsuccessive trials. Think, for example, of rolling a 4-sided die, then\na 9-sided die, and in general an \\((n+1)^2\\)-sided die on the\n\\(n\\)th trial …, a strategy for which the probability that\nyou will eventually wager for God is only 1/2, as Robertson\nshows. However, Easwaran and Monton 2012 counter-reply that with a\ncontinuum of times at which the dice can be rolled, the sequence of\nrolls that Robertson proposes can be completed in an arbitrarily short\nperiod of time. In that case, what should you do next? By Monton’s\nargument, it seems you should roll a die again. Easwaran and Monton\nprove that if there are uncountably many times at which one implements\na mixed strategy with non-zero probability of wagering for God, then\nwith probability 1, one ends up wagering for God at one of these\ntimes. (And they assume, as is standard, that once one wagers for God\nthere is no going back.) They concede that imagining uncountably rolls\nof a die, say, involves an idealization that is surely not physically\nrealizable. But they maintain that you should act in the way that an\nidealized version of yourself would eventually act, one\nwho can realize the rolls as described—that is, wager\nfor God outright. There is a further twist on the mixed strategies objection. To\nrepeat, the objection’s upshot is that even granting Pascal all his\npremises, still wagering for God is not rationally required. But we\nhave seen numerous reasons not to grant all his\npremises. Very well then; let’s not. Indeed, let’s suppose that you\ngive tiny probability p to them all being true,\nwhere \\(p\\) is positive and finite. So you assign\nprobability \\(p\\) to your decision problem being exactly as\nPascal claims it to be. But if it is, according to the mixed\nstrategies objection, all hell breaks loose. Yet again, \\(p\\)\nmultiplied by infinity gives infinity. Hence, it seems that each\naction that gets infinite expected utility according to Pascal\nsimilarly gets infinite expected utility according to you;\nbut by the previous reasoning, that is anything you might do. The full\nforce of the objection that hit Pascal now hits you too. There are\nsome subtleties that we have elided over; for example, if you also\nassign positive and finite probability to a source\nof negative infinite utility, then the expected utilities\ninstead become \\(\\infty\\) – \\(\\infty\\), which is undefined. But that\nis just another way for all hell to break loose for you: in that case,\nyou cannot evaluate the choiceworthiness of your possible actions at\nall. Either way, you face decision-theoretic paralysis. We might call\nthis Pascal’s Revenge. See Hájek (2015) for\nmore discussion.  \n\nLet us grant Pascal’s conclusion for the sake of the argument:\nrationality requires you to wager for God. It still does not obviously\nfollow that you should wager for God. All that we have granted\nis that one norm—the norm of rationality—prescribes\nwagering for God. For all that has been said, some other norm\nmight prescribe wagering against God. And unless we can show that the\nrationality norm trumps the others, we have not settled what you should\ndo, all things considered. \n\nThere are several arguments to the effect that morality\nrequires you to wager against God. Pascal himself appears to\nbe aware of one such argument. He admits that if you do not believe in\nGod, his recommended course of action “will deaden your\nacuteness” (This is Trotter’s translation. Pascal’s\noriginal French wording is “vous abêtira”, whose\nliteral translation is even more startling: “will make you a\nbeast”.)  One way of putting the argument is that wagering for\nGod may require you to corrupt yourself, thus violating a Kantian duty\nto yourself. Clifford 1877 argues that an individual’s believing\nsomething on insufficient evidence harms society by promoting\ncredulity. Penelhum 1971 contends that the putative divine plan is\nitself immoral, condemning as it does honest non-believers to loss of\neternal happiness, when such unbelief is in no way culpable; and that\nto adopt the relevant belief is to be complicit to this immoral\nplan. See Quinn 1994 for replies to these arguments. For example,\nagainst Penelhum he argues that as long as God treats non-believers\njustly, there is nothing immoral about him bestowing special favor on\nbelievers, more perhaps than they deserve. (Note, however, that Pascal\nleaves open in the Wager whether the payoff for non-believers \\(is\\)\njust; indeed, as far as his argument goes, it may be extremely\nunjust.) \n\nFinally, Voltaire protests that there is something unseemly about the\nwhole Wager. He suggests that Pascal’s calculations, and his appeal to\nself-interest, are unworthy of the gravity of the subject of theistic\nbelief. This does not so much support wagering against God, as\ndismissing all talk of ‘wagerings’ altogether. Schlesinger\n(1994, 84) canvasses a sharpened formulation of this objection: an\nappeal to greedy, self-interested motivations is incompatible with\n“the quest for piety” that is essential to religion. He\nreplies that the pleasure of salvation that Pascal’s Wager\ncountenances is “of the most exalted kind”, and that if\nseeking it counts as greed at all, then it is “the manifestation\nof a noble greed that is to be acclaimed” (85).  \n\nLet us now grant Pascal that, all things considered (rationality and\nmorality included), you should wager for God. What exactly does this\ninvolve? \n\nA number of authors read Pascal as arguing that you should\nbelieve in God—see e.g. Quinn 1994, and Jordan 1994a.\nBut perhaps one cannot simply believe in God at will; and rationality\ncannot require the impossible. Pascal is well aware of this objection:\n“[I] am so made that I cannot believe. What, then, would you have me\ndo?”, says his imaginary interlocutor. However, he contends that one\ncan take steps to cultivate such belief: \n\nBut to show you that this leads you there, it is this which will\nlessen the passions, which are your stumbling-blocks. \n\nWe find two main pieces of advice to the non-believer here: act like a\nbeliever, and suppress those passions that are obstacles to becoming a\nbeliever. And these are actions that one can perform at will. \n Believing in God is presumably one way to wager for God. This\npassage suggests that even the non-believer can wager for God, by\nstriving to become a believer. Critics may question the psychology of\nbelief formation that Pascal presupposes, pointing out that one could\nstrive to believe (perhaps by following exactly Pascal’s prescription),\nyet fail. To this, a follower of Pascal might reply that the act of\ngenuine striving already displays a pureness of heart that God would\nfully reward; or even that genuine striving in this case is itself a\nform of believing. \n According to Pascal, ‘wagering for God’ and\n‘wagering against God’ are contradictories, as there is no\navoiding wagering one way or another: “you must wager. It is not\noptional.” The decision to wager for or against God is one that\nyou make at a time—at \\(t\\), say. But of course Pascal does\nnot think that you would be infinitely rewarded for wagering for God\nmomentarily, then wagering against God thereafter; nor that you would\nbe infinitely rewarded for wagering for God sporadically—only on\nthe last Thursday of each month, for example. What Pascal intends by\n‘wagering for God’ is an ongoing action—indeed, one\nthat continues until your death—that involves your adopting a\ncertain set of practices and living the kind of life that fosters\nbelief in God. The decision problem for you at \\(t\\), then, is\nwhether you should embark on this course of action; to fail to do so\nis to wager against God at \\(t\\). \nPascal’s Wager vies with Anselm’s Ontological Argument for being the most famous argument in the philosophy of religion. Indeed, the Wager arguably has greater influence nowadays than any other such argument—not just in the service of Christian apologetics, but also in its impact on various lines of thought associated with infinity, decision theory, probability, epistemology, psychology, and even moral philosophy. It has provided a case study for attempts to develop infinite decision theories. In it, Pascal countenanced the notion of infinitesimal probability long before philosophers such as Lewis 1980 and Skyrms 1980 gave it prominence. It continues to put into sharp relief the question of whether there can be pragmatic reasons for belief, and the putative difference between theoretical and practical rationality. It raises subtle issues about the extent to which one’s beliefs can be a matter of the will, and the ethics of belief. \nReasoning reminiscent of Pascal’s Wager, often with an explicit\nacknowledgment of it, also informs a number of debates in moral\nphilosophy, both theoretical and applied. Kenny 1985 suggests that\nnuclear Armageddon has negative infinite utility, and some might say\nthe same for the loss of even a single human life. Stich 1978\ncriticizes an argument that he attributes to Mazzocchi, that there\nshould be a total ban on recombinant DNA research, since such research\ncould lead to the “Andromeda scenario” of creating a\nkiller strain of bacterial culture against which humans are helpless;\nthe ban, moreover, should be enforced if the “Andromeda scenario\nhas even the smallest possibility of occurring” (191), in\nMazzocchi’s words. This is plausibly read, then, as an\nassignment of negative infinite utility to the Andromeda\nscenario. More recently, Colyvan, Cox, and Steele 2010 discuss\nPascal’s Wager-like problems for certain deontological moral\ntheories, in which violations of duties are assigned negative infinite\nutility. Colyvan, Justus and Regan 2011 canvas difficulties associated\nwith assigning infinite value to the natural environment. Bartha and\nDesRoches 2017 respond, with an appeal to relative utility\ntheory. Stone 2007 argues that a version of Pascal’s Wager\napplies to sustaining patients who are in a persistent vegetative\nstate; see Varelius 2013 for a dissenting view. \nPascal’s Wager is a watershed in the philosophy of religion. As we have seen, it is also a great deal more besides.","contact.mail":"alan.hajek@anu.edu.au","contact.domain":"anu.edu.au"}]
