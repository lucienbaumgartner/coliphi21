What is perhaps surprising, however, is the degree to which\neven our current conscious knowledge typically depends on memory.  For\nexample, you look at the sky and come to believe that the sunset is\nbeautiful.  This is a newly formed belief about an event currently\ntaking place.  Nevertheless, its justification is no doubt dependent\non other beliefs that you hold.  For example, if you didn't at least\ntacitly believe that you were looking west or that it is evening and\nnot morning, the belief wouldn't be justified (I assume that the\nphenomenology of sunsets and sunrises is indistinguishable). Now I am\nnot, however, supposing that all knowledge of the external world is\ninferential. Your belief that the sky is red might well be\nepistemically basic.  Nor am I insisting that your sunset belief is\npsychologically inferential.  My only claim here is that many\nrelatively simple beliefs we form about the external world typically\ndepend for their justification on background beliefs; and background\nbeliefs are memory beliefs.\n\nYet the matter of the epistemology of memory belief is important\nfor its own sake as well. Virtually all of what we know (or are\njustified in believing) at any given time resides in memory.  However,\nepistemology has been focussed almost exclusively, even if implicitly,\non the epistemology of belief formation — of coming to\nbelieve a proposition.  Yet it is not at all clear that the conditions\nnecessary and sufficient for justifiably coming to believing a\nproposition are necessary and sufficient for justifiably maintaining\nit.  So if we are to understand how we know the vast majority of what\nwe know at any given time, we'll need an account of the epistemology\nof memory. This essay will focus on the issues that arise when one\nattempts to construct such a thing.\n\nThe nature of memory was hotly debated in the early modern period\nby British empiricists David Hume and John Locke, and by Scottish\nCommon Sense Realist Thomas Reid.  Our selective excursion into\nhistorical discussions will also include a consideration of Bertrand\nRussell's from The Analysis of Mind.  We'll conclude our\nhistorical review with the briefest of surveys from the small\nliterature of the second half of the last century.\n\nWith our limited survey completed, we'll next clarify the various\nways that “memory belief” can be construed. This turns out to\nbe a more complicated business than one might have thought.  Having\nmade a number of relevant distinctions and defined our terms, we'll at\nlast be prepared to consider how different kinds of theories account\nfor the justification of that which we remember.  Finally, we'll have\na look at the prospects for demonstrating the general reliability of\nmemory.\n\nMemory makes possible knowledge of the past.  But how it does this\nis far from clear.  The theory that has the best claim to the\n“traditional view” label is the “Representational\nTheory of Memory” (or RTM). When I recall my twenty-first birthday, I bring to mind something\nthat is now in the past; I think of an event that is no longer\noccurring. Therefore, the friend of RTM reasons, I can't now\nbe directly related to my twenty-first birthday since there is not\nnow an event that is my twenty-birthday.  The direct or\nimmediate object of a recollection must surely be something that\nexists at the time of the memorial event; one can't be directly aware\nof an entity that doesn't exist.  So what is it that one is immediately aware of in memory if not the\npast?  As its name implies, the RTM answer is that one is aware of a\nrepresentation of that past event.  Recall some important event in\nyour life — your twenty-first birthday, your bar mitzvah or\nconfirmation, your wedding, etc. You recall such events by bringing to\nmind images. So you picture, say, a large cake with twenty-one candles\nsitting on a table around which sit your parents and siblings.  You\nremember your twenty first birthday by recalling this image.  So as\nwith the representational theory of perception, the RTM claims that\nthe object of your immediate awareness in memory is a representation\nor image, and that it is in virtue of your now having that image that\nyou are now able to recall the event you are remembering.  A difficulty arises almost immediately.  As the last sentence of\nthe above paragraph suggests, other cognitive processes or faculties\nalso make use of images or representations.  Most obviously,\nperception and imagination depend crucially on the subject's having\nthe appropriate imagery.  What, then, makes a representation a\nmemory image rather than a perceptual or imaginary\nrepresentation? In his Treatise on Human Nature, David Hume discusses this\nvery question. No perceptual realist, Hume nevertheless went along\nwith the representational component of representational\nrealism.  Like the other empiricists of his time, Hume believed that\nthe immediate objects of cognition are representations.  It was his\nview of the relation of these perceptions to sensible objects that\ndistinguished the view of Hume from that of Locke (and from Berkeley's\nidealism). Hume divided the representations that inhabit the mind into two\ntypes: impressions and ideas. Impressions are the basic building\nblocks of cognition. In contrast with ideas of memory and imagination,\nimpressions come upon us with “force and liveliness.” Once\nwe've had an impression, we often find that “it again makes its\nappearance there as an idea.” When this happens, the impression\nretains some of its vivacity and forcefulness, and “is somewhat\nintermediate betwixt an impression and an idea” [Hume, 1739, Bk\n1, Part 1, Section 2], in which case it is a memory image.  Should it\nlose its vivacity entirely, it is then a “perfect idea” and\nis of the imagination. Hume, then, answers our question about the distinguishing\ncharacteristic of memory images by appealing to the relative vivacity\nand force of the image.  Memory images are, by definition, fainter\nthan impressions but more vivacious and forceful than images of\nimagination. While there may be a certain surface plausibility to Hume's account\nof memory, its inadequacies quickly come to light.  First, as Hume\nhimself recognizes, there is nothing in principle to prevent an idea\nof memory from being decidedly faint and without force (just as ideas\nof imagination can be vivid and forceful).  Hume can and does say that\nwhen memory ideas are faint, they are often not recognized as memory\nimages, but are instead taken to be of the imagination.  But this\nresponse confuses the issue.  Our concern here, and the one that Hume\nis addressing in the relevant sections of the Treatise, is\nwith the metaphysics of memory and not with its epistemology.  So it\ndoesn't matter that sometimes memory images may be mistaken for images\nof the imagination.  For even in describing such a circumstance, one\nassumes that the fact of the matter is that the image in question is a\nmemory image and that the subject has made a mistake in judging the\nimage to be of imagination.  We are trying to figure out the criteria\naccording to which an image is of memory and not the conditions under\nwhich one can introspectively know that this. Things don't get a lot better if we seek help from Hume's comrade\nin empiricism John Locke.  In the first edition of An Essay\nConcerning Human Understanding, Locke describes memory as the\n“storehouse” of ideas, but he never offers an account of\nwhat distinguishes a memory idea from an idea of imagination.  And\nwhile the storehouse metaphor remains in the second edition of the\nEssay, Locke nevertheless backs away from it dramatically.\nHe argues that because ideas don't exist unperceived there is no\nsignificant sense in which the ideas of memory continue to exist when\nwe are not thinking about them.  Rather the mind has the power to\n“revive” ideas that we are said to remember.  Be this as it\nmay, although Locke is clearly a proponent of RTM, he does nothing to\nhelp us answer the question of what it is that distinguishes memory\nimages from those of other kinds. We'll look at Locke's account a\nlittle more closely when we discuss Reid's criticisms of the RTM. While one finds little help in our query from Hume (because his\naccount is clearly flawed) or from Locke (he doesn't even appear to\nrecognize the issue), there is another empiricist who is more helpful,\nviz., Bertrand Russell.  In his The Analysis of Mind, Russell\noffers a distinctly RTM that clearly addresses the issue of what it is\nin virtue of which an image is a memory image.  Here is a clear\nstatement of his position as it involves a particular example:  Memory-images and imagination-images do not differ in their\nintrinsic qualities, so far as we can discover.  They differ by the\nfact that the images that constitute memories, unlike those that\nconstitute imagination, are accompanied by a feeling of belief which\nmay be expressed in the words “this happened.” The mere\noccurrence of images, without this feeling of belief constitutes\nimagination; it is the element of belief that is distinctive in\nmemory. [Russell 1921, pages 175-176] Russell's concludes his account as follows: Hume's and Russell's accounts of memory are both versions of the\nRTM.  They differ, however, in two important respects.  First, Hume's\naccount of memory sees the objects of memory as ideas.  But Humean\nideas are not essentially propositional.  In fact, a propositional\nrepresentation will have to be constructed from two or more ideas.  So\ninasmuch as we are interested in an account of memory belief,\nwhich is essentially propositional, we'll have to look elsewhere.  On\nthe other hand, the “images” that are the primary component\nof Russell's view surely have propositional content.  Russell's second\nimportant point of departure from Hume concerns that which is\ndistinctive of memory representations.  On Hume's account, memory\nimages are distinguished by an intrinsic property; memory images are\nmore vivid and forceful than images of imagination and less vivid and forceful\nthan impressions.  Pace Hume, Russell takes the\ndistinguishing feature of memory images to be relational: an image is\na memory image if it is associated with a certain feeling or belief to\nthe effect that the content of that image refers to an event in the\npast. One major advantage of Russell's view over Hume's is that Russell's\nis decidedly more economical.  For any event that one perceives,\nremembers, and imagines, one will need three distinct images each with\nthe appropriate level of vivacity and forcefulness.  Russell's view,\nin contrast, sees the difference between the different mental types as\ncoming in the relation to the same representation.  Russell's view, or\nsomething like it, has become standard in contemporary philosophy of\nmind: the difference between the thought that p, the desire\nthat p, and the belief that p is taken to be found\nnot in the representation itself but in the relationship one bears to\nthe representation.  In this way, the same thing can be the object of\nbelief, thought, desire, and any other propositional attitude. The most severe critic of the RTM was Scottish philosopher Thomas\nReid, a contemporary of Hume.  I'll close this section of this\nessay by looking at Reid's critique of Locke and Hume.  This will\nprovide us with a natural transition to the next section on the Direct\nTheory of Memory, the chief proponent of which is none other than Reid\nhimself. Reid begins his attack on the RTM by quoting Locke's concession\nthat the metaphor of the mind as a repository of ideas is not to be\ntaken strictly.  For on the standard Early Modern view, an idea is\nnecessarily consciously perceived. Stored ideas of which one is not\ncurrently aware are not possible; a non-conscious idea is an\nunperceived idea and hence an impossibility.  So Locke notes that to\nsay that the mind is a storehouse of ideas is only to say that the\nmind has: Reid notes that Locke's view here seems to be that no-longer\nexistent ideas are “revived” or brought back from the purely\nmetaphorical storehouse.  But as Locke himself acknowledges elsewhere\nin the Essay, no object can have two beginnings of existence\n— that is, it cannot come into existence at two distinct times.\nSo there is no serious sense in which an old idea is revived.  What\nLocke must be committed to, then, is not the mind's ability to\nresurrect nonexistent ideas but its power to produce new ideas that\nare similar in certain respects to ideas it has had before.  So Locke\nmust be read as saying that when we remember, our minds produce ideas\nthat we recognize as similar to ideas we have had before.  Of course,\nwe might take these ideas of memory to be the very same token ideas we\npreviously had, but this is just a pre-reflective opinion that we can\nsee on reflection is not quite right.  But even this somewhat sympathetic reading of Locke creates\nproblems.  For Locke's view entails not just that the mind has the\npower to produce these ideas but also that we have the ability (at\nleast much of the time) to recognize these ideas as ones (or like\nones) we've seen before.  Yet this ability would seem to itself\npresuppose memory.  As Reid says, this recognition (that this idea has\nbeen seen before) “supposes a remembrance of those we had\nbefore, otherwise the similitude or identity could not be\nperceived” [Reid 1785, Essay III, Chapter VII]. Far from\nilluminating the nature of memory, then, Locke's version of the RTM\nmerely presupposes what it sets out to explain. Yet even if this serious difficulty is resolved or ignored, there\nare other problems lurking nearby.  For, Reid argues, Locke's RTM does\nnot provide a sufficient condition for having a memory.  I'll let Reid\nspeak for himself: Lest I give the impression that Reid picks only on Locke, I should\nnote with due haste that he also has little patience with Hume's\naccount of memory.  Recall that Hume's theory is that a memory is an\nidea that is less vivid and forceful than an impression but more vivid\nand forceful than an idea of imagination.  Always the attentive\nreader, Reid quotes the passage from Hume's Treatise of Human\nNature in which Hume offers his initial characterization of\nmemory.  At the beginning of Book I, Part I, Section III of the\nTreatise, Hume writes “We find by experience when any\nimpression has been present with the mind, it again makes its\nappearance as an idea; and this it may do after two different\nways,” one of which is by memory.  Reid asks what Hume could mean\nby experience in the quoted sentence.  Reid can think of only\none plausible answer: memory.  So while Hume offers us a deflationary\naccount of memory according to which to remember something is merely\nto have an idea that is midway between an impression and an idea of\nimagination, he helps himself in forming the account to experience\nwhich, Reid argues, turns out to require the robust memory of common\nsense.  Reid says, According to vulgar apprehension, memory is an immediate knowledge\nof something past.  Our author [i.e., Hume] does not admit that there\nis any such knowledge in the human mind.  He maintains that memory is\nnothing but a present idea or impression. But, in defining what he\ntakes memory to be, he takes for granted that kind of memory which he\nrejects.  For can we find by experience, that an impression, after its\nfirst appearance to the mind, makes a second, and a third, with\ndifferent degrees of strength and vivacity, if we have not so distinct\na remembrance of its first appearance, as enables us to know it, upon\nits second and third, notwithstanding that, in the interval, it has\nundergone a very considerable change.   All experience supposes memory; and there can be no such thing as\nexperience, without trusting to our own memory or that of others; so\nthat it appears from Mr. Hume's account of this matter, that he found\nhimself to have that kind of memory, which he acknowledges and\ndefines, by exercising that kind which he rejects. [Reid 1785, Essay\nIII, Chapter VII]  So Reid thinks that Hume is illegitimately smuggling in a more\nstandard understanding both of what memory is and of the knowledge it\nprovides in giving his deflationary account.  But it gets worse.\nHume's theory does no better than Locke's in offering a sufficient\ncondition for memory. First, as Locke and Reid have previously noted,\nit isn't literally true that the ideas of memory are the same ideas\nthat were experienced before; when we cease to be conscious of the\noriginal ideas, they cease to exist.  So memory must be nothing but\n“the faculty of making a weak impression…after a\ncorresponding strong one.” But to this, Reid offers the\nfollowing counterexample: Reid's point is that Hume's account of memory entails that the\nperson who is able to both bring about an impression and then,\nsometime later, a somewhat less forceful impression or idea (say, by\nliterally hitting his head against a wall, once hard enough to really\nhurt, once not so hard), thereby remembers the first. But surely such\nhead banging is not remembering.  Reid offers one further criticism of the RTM.  He notes the\nstructural similarity between the RTM and the representational theory\nof perception.  He claims that Hume followed the logic of the view\nthat the only objects that are truly given in perception are ideas,\nthat all we ever experience are representations, to its natural\nconclusion: all we can have knowledge of are our ideas.  If there is\nany single lesson taught by the history of epistemology, it is that\nthere are no successful arguments that have only premises about the\ncontents of our ideas and which conclude with propositions about\nphysical objects.  The so-called Theory of Ideas in the realm of sense\nperception brings with it skepticism about the physical world. Reid argues that for exactly similar reasons, the RTM leads to\nskepticism about the past.  If we begin with the thesis that in memory\nall that one is aware of are ideas, then in order to justify beliefs\nabout the past one will have to provide an argument with premises\nabout our present ideas and a conclusion that the past is how we\nremember it.  But there is no more reason to think that such an\nargument will be forthcoming than there is for thinking that on the\nbasis of our ideas of sense we can show that the world is as we\nsuppose it to be. In sum, then, Reid argues that the both Lockean and Humean versions\nof RTM fail because (a) they presuppose a more robust variety of\nmemory than they can allow for, (b) they fail to shed light on the\nnature of memory because of (a), (c) the accounts they do offer are\nsatisfied by many things that aren't memory, and (d) finally, they\nlead to skepticism about the past.  Each of these points is well-taken\nand taken together seem more than adequate reason for rejecting\nLocke's and Hume's accounts of memory. But what about Russell's view? Do Reid's objections hit the mark\nthere too? It would seem that they do.  As we have seen, Russell's\nview is that remembering involves the having of an image together with\na “belief-feeling” that what the image depicts is in the\npast.  On the assumption that we are at least generally reliable\nregarding which images we have previously experienced (that is, on the\nassumption that we don't have these memory feelings willy nilly),\nRussell's theory includes an unanalyzed component that includes the\nsubstance of memory.  Furthermore, Russell's theory is consistent with\none's being mistaken about the pastness of the image. That is, images\nthat are the products of imagination but which have a misleading air\nof familiarity to them, will count as memories on Russell's view as\nlong as they are associated with a belief feeling.  Finally, inasmuch\nas the RTM theories of Locke and Hume can be fairly charged with\naiding and abetting the skeptic, Russell's theory is guilty of the\nsame.  To remember is to have an image and a belief feeling;\ndemonstrating a reliable connection between these two and the past\nevent one is said to be remembering looks to be just another instance\nof arguing from the current contents of one's mind to the truth of\nclaims about the external world (in this case, about the way the\nexternal world was). Thomas Reid's view of memory is worth discussing if only because it\nprovides a clear contrast to the view of the Locke, Hume, Russsell,\nand the whole RTM.   Reid was not only a critic of the RTM but of the whole\n“Theory of Ideas” on which it was based.  Thus, he was\njust as opposed to the representative theory of perception as he was\nto the RTM.  In contrast to the RTM and to representative theories in\ngeneral, Reid held to a theory of memory that I'll call the Direct\nTheory of Memory (the DTM).  On Reid's view, memory is immediate in\nthe same way that perception is immediate.  My, say, seeing the table\nis immediate if and only if there is no other object O such\nthat it is in virtue of my seeing O that I see the table.\nThe Representative Theory of Perception holds that our perception of\nthe world is always mediated by the perception of our ideas of sense\nor, in Hume's vocabulary, our impressions. These ideas and\nimpressions, these representations, mediate our knowledge of the\nworld, if knowledge of the world there be.   Reid believed that there was no reason to posit ideas that we\nperceive immediately.  This is not to say, of course, that our\nperception of the world lacks an experiential component but only to\ndeny that it is in virtue of perceiving that element that we perceive\nthe world.  Reid thought that just as representationalism for\nperception was flawed, so was the RTM.  When I remember having corn\nflakes for breakfast, Reid argues, it isn't in virtue of my now\nremembering an image of a bowl of cereal that I now remember\nmy breakfast.  Rather, my remembering breakfast is a direct\napprehension of the past.  Of course, there is an experiential element\nto my memory, but that doesn't begin to show that I only remember\nbreakfast in virtue of “remembering” the mental image.  To\nget from the experience to the representative theory requires two\nsteps: a reification of the experience into an idea or image and the\nepistemic claim that my knowing that I had cornflakes for breakfast is\nmediated by my knowledge of that idea or image. What, then, is memory on Reid's view? According to Reid, memory is\na faculty by which we:  The object of memory…must be something that is\npast…What now is, cannot be an object of memory; neither can\nthat which is past and gone be an object of perception or of\nconsciousness.  Memory is always accompanied with the belief of that\nwhich we remember, as perception is accompanied with the belief that\nthat which we perceive… [Reid 1785, Essay III, Chapter\nI] So Reid's account of memory is “direct” in that he\ninsists that we have “immediate knowledge of things past.”\nA remembrance is an act of the mind and it is in virtue of this act\nthat we have knowledge of the past.  So Reid flatly rejects what some\nhave claimed to be a datum: when one is remembering what one is\nremembering must be present at the time of the remembering.  Indeed,\nnot only does Reid reject this principle, but he accepts its contrary:\nwhen one is remembering what one is remembering must not be present\nwhen one is remembering, but must be in the past instead.   Does Reid's view carry with it any absurdity?  It has seemed to\nsome that it does. How, it might be asked, can something be remembered\nand hence be present before the mind while at the same time not in the\npresent but in the past?  Isn't that like saying that is it possible\nto perceive objects that don't exist?  Reid would allow that nothing\ncould be both present before the mind and at the same time past but\ninsist that his theory entails no such consequence.  Reid claims that\nwhile, necessarily, the object of memory is in the past at the time it\nis remembered, nevertheless “the remembrance of it is a\nparticular act of the mind which now exists, and of which we are\nconscious.” [Reid 1785, Essay III, Section I] That is, when one\nremembers p, the act of remembering is what is\npresent (or better “occurring”) although\np is not. We are currently aware of our act of remembering\nbut the object of the act is in the past.  So far, so good.  But what exactly is the cognitive act of\nremembering? And what distinguishes it from other mental events? If we\nare looking for full-blown analysis of memory from Reid, we're going\nto be disappointed.  Although Reid points to certain characteristics\nof memory (i.e., that the object must be in the past, that it\nprovides immediate knowledge, that the thing remembered is distinct\nfrom the remembrance of it, etc), he seems to hold that it is in the\nend unanalyzable.  He writes: His claim that memory is “unaccountable” could be\nunderstood in at least two different ways.  He might mean only that he\ndoesn't have an account of the actual workings of the faculty, that he\nlacks a psychological theory of the operation of the mechanism by\nwhich we remember. Yet this would not be a reason for thinking that\nmemory is “unaccountable,” but only “presently\nunaccounted for”. So the most plausible interpretation is that\nmemory is unanalyzable.  Reid's insistence that memory cannot be\naccounted for via a relationship to an image, but that it is instead\nan immediate knowledge of the past would seem to support the\nunanalyzablity reading.  To call memory “unanalyzable” in\nthe sense Reid has in mind is to say that it cannot be analyzed or\nreduced to component parts, at least not over and above its\ncharacterization as direct knowledge of the past. When looking for problems with the DTM a good place to start is by\nrecalling the problems that face a Direct Theory of Perception.  The\nmost obvious and possibly most serious problem for the DTP is the\nproblem of error.  If perceiving X as F is nothing\nmore than having a direct awareness of X's being F,\nthen how is it that we are often wrong in our perceptual beliefs?  To\nallow for the possibility of error, it seems that an account must\nprovide space for things to go wrong.  Similarly, the DTM tells us\nsimply that memory provides us with immediate knowledge of the past.\nBut it doesn't seem that it always does that; after all, memory is\nfallible.  This “problem,” though, might not bother Reid\nwho claims that when memory is “distinct and determinate”\nand when the mind is sound, then what is believed is “no less\ncertain than if it was grounded on demonstration” [Reid 1785,\nEssay III, Section I].  Reid also claims, when considering a case of\nhis remembering something from earlier in the day, “It is\nimpossible that this act [of remembrance] should be, if the event\n[i.e., the event remembered] did not happen” [Reid 1785, Essay\nIII, Section II].  So Reid might welcome the result that the DTM\napparently entails the infallibility of memory (at least where what it\nremembered is distinct and the mind is in good working order).  But\nwhether Reid acknowledges it or not, it surely it a problem.  Even\nclear and distinct “memories” in those who suffer from no\npsychological disorder can turn out to be false. The twentieth century saw rather little work on the epistemology of\nmemory. We've already seen that Russell continued and improved upon\nthe RTM tradition of the empiricists. Inasmuch as memory was discussed\nin the epistemological literature in the middle of the last century,\nthe issue of concern was the nature of remembering, or more precisely,\nthe nature of “remembering.” What is the proper analysis\nof “S remembers P at t”? As we have seen, there was a tradition going back to Locke and Hume\naccording to which having a memory of an event required having a\nbelief that the event occurred.  In their classic essay\n“Remembering,” C.B. Martin and Max Deustscher read Locke\n(and others) as claiming that the belief condition is necessary for\nS's remembering.  In defense of Locke, it can be argued that\nhe was interested in giving an account of what it is that makes a\nbelief a memory belief; if that is correct, then the belief condition\nsurely is unobjectionable. Martin and Deutscher offer a compelling reason for thinking that\nbelief is not necessary for S to remember something.  They\ngive an example of a painter who believes that the scene he is\npainting derives from his imagination rather than from his memory.\nYet it turns out that the mental image guiding his work is the product\nof his experience at a farm when he was very young.  So he remembers,\nsay, the horse galloping across the meadow, although, believing that\nthis is the product of his imagination, he does not believe that what\nhe is depicting is an actual event.  Yet so long as the image is\ncausally connected with his past experience in the right way, the\npainter will be remembering the horse even though he doesn't believe\nthat there was such a horse in such a meadow. The Martin and Deutscher account of remembering is essentially\nthis: S remembers (that) X iff X,\nS has observed (that) X in the past, S's\ncurrent representation of X is appropriately causally related\nto S's earlier experience of (that) X via a memory\ntrace.  It is not enough that S's current state be simply\n“causally dependent” on S's earlier state since\nthere are deviant causal chain examples in which this condition is\nsatisfied without their being instances of memory.  For instance,\nsuppose Jones has an altercation with Smith that he then describes to\nJohnson.  Five years later, Jones has irretrievably forgotten about\nhis disagreement with Smith but Johnson, who possesses a much better\nmemory, remembers what Jones told him five years ago, and tells Jones\neverything he remembers about the incident.  Now Jones has a\nrepresentation that is causally dependent upon his earlier\nrepresentation of his altercation with Smith, but Jones still doesn't\nremember the relevant interaction with Smith. It should be noted that\nMartin and Deutscher have a fair amount to say about what the\nappropriate causal relation is (indeed, that phrase doesn't appear in\ntheir article), but their discussion is too long and complicated to\nreproduce here. The analysis of remembering that Martin and Deutscher offered was\nnot particularly in the spirit of the times.  More common was the view\nof Norman Malcolm, who explicitly eschewed a causal condition because\nhe thought that if one were included, it would follow that anytime\nsomeone remembered something, she would have to have beliefs about the\nneurophysiology of memory.  (Martin and Deutscher correctly point out\nthat the claim that the concept of “remembering” includes\na causal component has no such implication.)  The non-causal accounts\nof Malcolm, Gilbert Ryle, and R.F. Holland tend to require only\nprevious experience and a lack of a current, independent source of\ninformation about the event, perhaps (as in the case of Malcolm) with\nthe additional claim of the following counterfactual dependence:\nwithout the previous experience the subject would not be having the\ncurrent representation.  Again, Martin and Deutscher put their\ncollective finger on a problem with such accounts. One might have the\nrelevant experience, lack a current source and still not be\nremembering. For example, it might turn out that the current apparent\nmemory is causally unrelated to the original source.  Even if we add\nMalcom's counterfactual component to the account, there can still be\ncases in which a person has the current present experience only\nbecause of the earlier experience, but the chain that leads from the\nearlier experience to the present is not of the right sort for\nmemory. No matter what exactly the facts about the metaphysics of memory\nand the analysis of remembering are, we will need a more precise\ncharacterization of the notion of a memory belief before we can\nproceed. To begin with, it will be useful to see what memory is not.\nFirst, it is tempting to think that memory is knowledge of the past.\nBut this definition is doubly problematic.  Although everyone but the\nskeptic thinks that there is memory knowledge, it is universally\nagreed upon that not every belief in memory is an instance of\nknowledge.  There is remembered false belief.  The second reason that\nmemory can't be defined as knowledge of the past is that one can\nremember an event that has yet to take place or at least an event that\nis temporally present.  I might recall now that I have a doctor's\nappointment in two hours. One might take this to be memory of a future\nevent. However, it can be reasonably argued that this is only a\nrecollection of the fact that I currently have an appointment to see\nthe doctor at a future time.  The fact that one can have a memory belief about the future (or at\nleast about the present) might be easier to see once another\ndistinction has been made. I have a memory belief that the Japanese\nattacked Pearl Harbor on December 7th 1941, but there is a\nperfectly straightforward sense of ‘remember’ in which I\ncan't be said to remember the attack.  Some philosophers want to make\nthis distinction by saying that although I can remember that\nPearl Harbor was attacked on that date, I can't remember the event\nitself.  To have the relevant sort of memory of the event (as opposed\nto only remembering a proposition about the event), I have to have\nexperienced it myself.  Exactly what the “experience”\nrequirement comes to is not entirely clear.  Although no one born\nafter the event can truly be said to remember it in this sense, it\nisn't obvious that one had to be at Pearl Harbor on that date\nto have this kind of memory.  Hearing about it on the radio that\nevening is arguably sufficient for having remembering the event.\nLet's mark the distinction of this paragraph by calling the former\n‘propositional memory’ and the latter ‘event\nmemory.’ The objects of propositional memory are propositions;\nthe objects of event memory are events.  My memory that the\ncake at the party was chocolate is propositional; my memory\nof the party is an event memory. While one can't have event\nmemory of a future event, one might have propositional memory of a\nproposition that refers to an event that has yet to happen; one can\nremember that an event will take place. Although it is clear that this distinction is real and significant,\nI don't propose to have too much more to say about it here.  Since\nepistemology is primarily the study of knowledge and rational belief,\nand since knowledge and belief are propositional in nature, we'll here\nlimit our focus to propositional memory. The question now is whether there is any important, structural\ndifference between propositional memory that begins as event memory of\nthe event that the proposition is about and propositional memory that\ndoesn't significantly involve event memory.  For example, my memory\nthat my driveway was icy last Christmas is propositional, yet it is\nbased on my experience of the event in question.  My memory belief\nthat Abraham Lincoln was shot in Ford's Theatre is not based on any\nsuch event (although, of course, for virtually any non-innate belief,\nthere will be some event that leads to its formation).  There can be cases of propositional memory that are not based on\nevent memory even when the memory is due to one's experience of the\nevent in question.  Last Christmas, I came to believe that my driveway\nwas then icy; that's why I parked on the street.  My belief that my\ndriveway was icy was formed on the basis of my perceiving the ice.\nBut now that I recall the condition of my driveway, I don't base my\nbelief on my event memory of the icy driveway.  I just remember that\nmy driveway was icy.  On the other hand, there are cases where one\ndoes recall an event and form a new belief on the basis of a memory\nimage. For example, if I were asked whether the ice on my driveway\nlast Christmas was uniform, I might well call to mind a memory image\nof the driveway and see if it contains that information.  In this\ncase, it seems, I am using event memory (i.e., memory of my\nseeing the driveway) to form a belief about the uniformity of the\nthickness of the ice.  There is a real sense, then, in which the\nbelief that the ice's thickness was (say) uniform is not a memory\nbelief in at least one legitimate sense of that term. There is surely\na suitable way of thinking of memory beliefs that stipulates that only\nbeliefs that have been formed at a prior time count as memory\nbeliefs. So there are myriad philosophical and even epistemological issues\nthat memory raises.  To keep this discussion manageable, we will have\nto narrow our focus a bit.  First, we will be concerned in what\nfollows only with the epistemology of memory beliefs.  But as we've\nseen, there are a number of things that ‘memory belief’\nmight designate.  So to make the domain of our discussion precise,\nwe'll have to give it a stipulative (and hence somewhat artificial)\ndefinition.  Let the following be our working definition of memory\nbelief: This definition requires some explanation.  Clause (a)\ndistinguishes memory belief from beliefs newly formed on the basis of\na memory image. If one has never before believed p, then\nS can't now have a memory belief that p, although one might\nnow form a belief for the first time on the basis of an event memory.\nClause (b) is necessary to distinguish cases in which one believes\nthat P at one time, completely and utterly forgets\nP, and then relearns P from an independent source.\nClause (c) requires that the belief not be occurrent all the time from\nthe time it was formed until the time at which we are calling it a\nmemory belief.  I'm not certain this restriction is required, but I\nthink having it rules out certain complicating factors.  For example,\nif I believe that P and hold it in occurrent, working memory\nfor one minute, say, shall we now count it as a memory belief?  What\nif I hold it in memory for ten seconds?  Two seconds?  If we require\nthat a belief must have been nonoccurrent (while still continuing to\nexist) for a time before it's now counting as a memory belief, we\ndon't have to deal with these issues, which are anyway not central to\nour concerns.  One other important note here: I have required that it\nbe the “same belief” that is at one time occurrent, then\ndispositional, and then occurent again.  This is not the requirement\nthat it be the same token belief all along, but only a belief with the\nsame content that, after its first appearance, is appropriately\ncausally related to earlier tokens of that person's having that belief\nwith that content.  When I believe that my car is locked because I\njust checked the doors, and later recall that my car is locked, it\nmight be that my later belief is not token identical with the earlier\nbelief.  On the other hand, I don't want to insist that it is not the\nsame token.  I shall be leaving this issue open. Another issue that needs discussing here is whether\n‘S has the memory belief that P at\nt’ includes only beliefs that are occurrent at\nt.  Or do we mean to be including in the domain of our\ndiscussion beliefs that are at the time dispositional?  This is an\nimportant question because if we mean to be including nonoccurrent\nbeliefs then our domain is a great deal larger than it would otherwise\nbe. There is good reason to be inclusive here.  At any given time,\nnearly all a person's beliefs are dispositional.  A good\nepistemological theory will then have to say something about the\nepistemic status of these beliefs.  So our definition of memory belief\nshould not be limited to the exceedingly small class of occurrent\nmemory beliefs.  Perhaps the epistemologist will need to have\nsomething special to say about occurrent memory beliefs, but our main\ntopic will be more general than that. Having carefully circumscribed the domain of our inquiry, we are\nnow in a position to consider how memory belief gets its\njustification. This is not the place to argue for any particular\ntheory, so we'll canvas the theoretical means that different types of\ntheories have for avoiding skepticism about memorial belief.  In this\nsection, we will discuss foundationalism, coherentism, deontological\ntheories, and reliabilism as well as the relevance of internalist and\nexternalist considerations for the justification of memory belief. Perhaps the most common theory of the justification of memory\nbelief is a variety of foundationalism.  We can distinguish between\ntwo types of foundational theories of the justification of memory\nbelief: simple foundationalism holds that every memory belief, just in\nvirtue of being a memory belief, is prima facie justified.\nMemory is not merely a repository for belief but a generation\nmechanism for justification (see Audi 1998 pp. 68-69).  In contrast to this is what we might call “experiential\nfoundationalism.” The experiential foundationalist requires that\na memory belief be accompanied by an image or at least an experiential\n“memory seeming” in order to be justified.  In demanding\nthat memory requires an image, such a view ipso facto implies\nthat the justification of memory belief requires the having of an\nexperience of a certain type if the memory is to be justified. (For a\ncritical discussion of both varieties of foundationalism see Senor\n1993. For a somewhat sympathteic treatment see Huemer 1999 and for a\ndefense of memory foundationalism see Schroer 2008.)   How plausible this variety of foundationalism is will depend on\nthe variety of epistemic justification it is concerned with.  For\nexample, if one is committed to a strong truth-connection and thinks\nthat a belief that is justified must be in some significant sense\nlikely to be true, then adopting either of the above versions of\nfoundationalism is out of the question. For there is no necessary\nconnection between a belief's being stored and recalled (with or\nwithout a memorial seeming) and its being likely to be true.  This\nisn't to say that memory is not generally reliable.  But its\nreliability is at best conditional: miracles aside, an agent's\nrecalled beliefs will be likely to be true only if her belief-forming\n(as opposed to preserving) processes are generally reliable.  So the\nsimple foundationalist will see herself as giving conditions for an\ninternalistic variety of justification that minimizes the connection\nbetween a belief's being justified and its being true.   One difficulty that experiential foundationalism faces is that it\naccounts only for the justificatory status of occurrent memory\nbeliefs.  But as was argued above, this leaves almost all of our\nbeliefs either unjustified (since the foundationalist might be read as\nclaiming that a memory belief is justified only if it is occurrent) or\nepistemically unaccounted for (since, as is more likely, the\nfoundationalist will see herself only providing conditions for the\njustification of occurrent memory beliefs).  This problem might be\nthought resolved by appealing to counterfactuals or dispositions. That\nis, a stored belief might be thought to be prima facie\njustified iff were this belief to become occurrent, it would be would\nbe accompanied by the appropriate memory image or seeming.  Yet this\ncondition is pretty clearly false.  The phenomenology of recollection\ndepends crucially on the context in which the belief is recalled.\nTypically, the experience one has when one recalls a belief depends at\nleast on how the recollection was cued, how much attention one is\ncurrently paying to the recalled belief, and what other beliefs are\nthen occurrent. For reasons that will presently become apparent, we will consider\nthe problems of simple foundationalism when we discuss negative\ncoherentism. We can divide coherentist theories into two types: positive and\nnegative.  The positive coherentist will claim that a memory belief is\njustified if it possesses a sufficiently strong coherence relation\nwith one's system of belief.  This is “positive” coherence\nbecause such coherence demands more than an absence of doxastic\nconflict. For a belief to positively cohere it must in some way be\nsupported or made probable by the doxastic system with which it\ncoheres.  (BonJour 1985 never discusses the epistemology of memory in\nparticular, but the view he presents there entails a positive\ncoherentist account; and in BonJour 2002, pp. 183-184, he gives a\npositive coherentist account of memory justification and explicitly\nrejects the foundationalism he accepts in other epistemic domains.)\nThe negative coherentist, on the other hand, will insist only that\nthere be an absence of conflict with the belief system in order for\nthe memory belief to be justified. In effect, the negative coherence\ntheory and the simple version of foundationalism are just the same:\neach claims that in the absence of defeat, memory beliefs are\njustified. (For a defense of negative coherentism see Harman 1986 and\nMcGrath 2007; for a critical discussion see Senor 1995.) Both varieties of the coherence theory can be understood in a way\nthat allows them to avoid the problem we noted for experiential\nfoundationalism: each can be taken as a theory of justification for\nmemory beliefs, both dispositional and occurrent (and since negative\ncoherentism and simple foundationalism are essentially the same\ntheory, we will consider simple foundationalism here as well).  Taken\nas global theories of the justification of memory belief, they claim\nthat any stored belief is prima facie justified.  Yet there other\nproblems that infect both theories.  The primary problem for positive\ncoherence theories is what has been dubbed the “problem of\nforgotten evidence.” A belief might positively cohere with the\nsubject's belief system at the time the belief was formed but later\nfail to positively cohere even though it intuitively remains\njustified.  One might have once had a web beliefs about American\nhistory with which the belief that Lincoln was assassinated in Ford\nTheatre neatly cohered.  Yet years after having had one's last history\nclass, this belief might remain while much of the imbedding web was\ndisappeared.  Yet, intuitively, it is still justified.  The\ncoherentist might hope to reply to this problem by claiming that there\nis still a justificatory web: the belief is a memory belief and one\nmight believe that most of one's memory beliefs are true; therefore,\nthis belief is likely to be true and is hence justified.  The problem\nwith this response is that it works for just any memory belief; if\nthis gambit is allowed, then every memory belief will be prima facie\njustified.  That is, accepting this solution to the problem of\nforgotten evidence amounts to trading in positive coherence theory for\nits negative sister. A problem for negative coherentism (and hence for simple\nfoundationalism) is that a belief that is unjustified when formed will\nbecome justified simply in virtue of being stored in memory.  Suppose\nthat I come to believe, unreliably and for no reason at all, that\nPresident Kennedy loved green tea.  My belief is unjustified when I\nform it.  But when I come to have it and it becomes a memory belief,\nthe conditions of its justification are now wholly different.  As long\nas I have no defeaters for my memory belief, the negative coherentist\ntells us, it is justified.  So the next day, when I believe that\nKennedy loved green tea, my belief will be justified (since I possess\nno defeater for it).  And while it isn't quite as acute, the problem\nexists also for the other versions of foundationalism and coherentism.\nTake experiential foundationalism first; suppose it seems to me that I\nremember reading that Kennedy loved green tea but that in fact I've\nnever read any such thing and that any historical belief I possess\ncomes with a strong conviction (a “memory seeming”) that I\nacquired the belief by reading it in a very reputable publication.\nThen again, my forming the belief unjustifiably together with my\nepistemic vice of always believing that my history beliefs come from\n“very reputable” sources together turn an unjustified\nbelief into a justified one. But this seems to be the epistemic\nequivalent of two wrongs making a right.  Notice that the same kind of\ncase will show a similar difficulty for positive coherentism.  For a\nperson who thinks his every history belief comes from a very reputable\nsource and who believes that he has a given history belief, will have\na system with which his belief that Kennedy loved green tea\ncoheres.  The Kennedy case might be thought to indicate that foundationalist\nand coherentist accounts of the justification of memory belief share a\ncommon flaw: they are both (at least as typically construed)\nsynchronic rather than diachronic theories.  They make the\njustificatory status of a memory a belief purely a function of the\ncurrent, internal state of the person at the time in question.  Put\nsomewhat differently, the only properties relevant to the\njustification of my belief are my current, non-historical properties.\nBut, arguably, what the Kennedy case shows is that, in at least some\ncircumstances, whether a memory belief is justified now is\npartially dependent on whether it was justified earlier.\n One might think that even if some forms of internalism are thereby\nshown to require a diachronic component, a deontological internalism\n— a theory of justification that emphasizes epistemic duty and\nresponsibility — will surely be synchronic.  What matters for\nduty fulfillment is that you are now doing the best you can\nand not that you did the best you could when you initially formed the\nbelief.  So, the synchronic holdout continues, if you now sincerely\nbelieve that Kennedy was partial to green tea, and you also believe\nthat this belief was generated from a very reputable source, then you\nare doing your best and surely must be deemed deontologically\njustified in your memory belief.   This consideration shows one can describe a concept of\ndeontological justification according to which only synchronic\nconsiderations matter. Its theoretical use will be akin to the use of\nthe parallel synchronic notion of ethical duty fulfillment and\nresponsibility.  Suppose I owe you a hundred dollars and am in a\nposition to repay you.  But instead of doing paying my debt, I spend\nmy money frivolously and become once again broke.  Looked at\nsynchronically, my present inability to pay apparently makes my\nfailing to pay excusable. I can't give you what I don't have, and if\n‘ought’ implies ‘can,’ then it's not the case that I\nought to pay you.  I daresay that you won't be impressed by this line\nof defense, should I be foolish enough to use it. This shows that\nsynchronic deontological concepts are dubious philosophical\nsignificance.  So there is no significant refuge for the synchronic\ntheory of the justification of memory belief in deontologism.  If internalism in its various guises fails to generate an adequate\naccount of the justification of memory belief, then we should consider\nexternalism. Since reliabilism is the most plausible and popular\nexternalism theory, we'll do well to put our focus there.  Loosely,\nreliabilism claims that a belief is justified if it is the product of\na reliable belief-forming process. Perhaps, then, we should say that a\nmemory belief is justified if it is a product of a reliable memory\nprocess.  As long as we are thinking of reliability as propensity to\ngenerate truth rather than as a measure of the track-record of a\nprocess, then a process's being reliable is a synchronic property of\nthat process.  So will the reliabilist believe that the justificatory\nstatus of a belief earlier is irrelevant to its status as a memory\nbelief?  No, she won't.  The reliabilist will think of memory as what\nAlvin Goldman has called a “belief-dependent process”\n(Goldman 1979).  The input of the belief-dependent process is a\nbelief.  Memory belief is (normally, at any rate) belief that has been\nkept in memory.  So a reliabilist will hold that a memory belief is\njustified only if the memorial process that maintains it is reliable\nand if it was justified when originally formed.  To hold otherwise\nwould be very much out of keeping with the spirit of reliabilism.  The lesson, the reliabilist will tell us, is that the justificatory\nstatus of a memory belief is, in standard cases, partially a function\nof the belief's justificatory status at an earlier time.  I say\n“in standard cases” because it is possible, of course, for\none to acquire new information that will turn a formerly unjustified\nbelief into a now justified memory belief.  But in the majority of\ncases, when the memory belief is not accompanied by new information,\none will be justified now only if one was justified at an earlier\ntime.  This consequence of the theory is plausible because memory is\ngenerally a belief-preserving rather than a belief-generating process.\nUnlike perception, which takes nondoxastic inputs and produces\nbeliefs, memory aims at preservation.  Thus it is natural that the\nepistemology of the former depends only on the conditions at the time\nof the operation of the process, while the justification of the latter\nsort of belief makes demands on its history.  What both have in common\nis that the pedigree of the belief is relevant to its epistemic\nstatus; the pedigree of memory belief is just a more complicated and\nhistorically robust affair.  Although reliabilism might seem to be particularly suited to\naccounting for the diachronic aspects of the justification of memory\nbelief, other theories we've looked at are able to accommodate the\nhistorical point too.  Exactly how these diachronic\ncomponents figure into a full-blown theory of the justification of\nmemory belief is a complex and controversial matter.  This is not the\nplace to arbitrate between competing epistemic perspectives.  Suffice\nit to say that the kinds of general problems we've seen in standard\ntheories of justified memory belief can apparently be handled within\nthe theoretical means available to foundationalist and coherentist\nepistemologies.  Each theory can be amended, for instance, to simply\nrequire that when the memory belief has not come to be based on new\ninformation it will be now justified only if it was justified when the\nbelief was initially formed, where the conditions of initial\njustifications are those that theory spells out.  The claim that there is a key diachronic element to the\njustification of memory belief has come to be known\nas preservationism.  Memory, it is thought, serves to\npreserve both the belief and its justification; a belief that had no\njustification when it was formed, has no justification to be\npreserved. According to the preservationist, then, such a belief will\nbe unjustified when recalled (and, for that matter, while in\nmemory). (Preservationist accounts can be found in Audi 1995, Audi\n1998, Dummett 1994, Goldman 1999, and Plantinga 1993.) Although the preservationist can allow that memory generates\njustification when it also generates a new belief (recall the example\nof my using my event memory of the ice on my driveway to form the new\nbelief that the ice on my driveway was of uniform thickness), she'll\ninsist that when memory acts only to preserve belief, it is not an\nepistemically generative process. However, the claim that memory is\nnot generative has recently come under attack. Jennifer Lackey has\npresented cases in which, at t1, S has\na prima facie justified but defeated belief that P\nbut over time comes to lose the defeater and hence\nat t2 has an ultima facie justified\nbelief that P. That is to say, at t1 the\nbelief is unjustified but at t2 the belief is\njustified even though S has acquired no new evidence\nregarding P. So, it is argued, memory can generate epistemic\njustification. (For discussion of these cases see Lackey 2005, Senor\n2007, and Lackey 2007.) We'll conclude our discussion of the epistemology of memory with a\nbrief consideration of an issue absolutely fundamental to the whole\nenterprise.  Epistemologists of all stripes will agree that the\nreliability of memory is crucial if there is to be memory knowledge.\nAnd while space prohibits a long exploration into this matter, we will\nbe able to make some important points about the likelihood of\nsuccessfully showing the reliability of memory. There is little doubt that within certain parameters, there can be\nevidence of the reliability of memory, and of its reliability in\nparticular situations and among particular groups. Cognitive\npsychologists can test people's memory for associated word pairs, and\ndetermine under what conditions forgetting is more likely to occur.\nSuch studies are not only intrinsically interesting (in part because\nwe depend on memory for so much) but potentially very useful in\nhelping us to know what to do to increase our ability to recall\ninformation when it is needed.  But as interesting and useful as such\nempirical studies are, there is reason to doubt their ability ever to\nshow the general reliability of memory. To see this, suppose Sid is a cognitive psychologist running\nexperiments in which subjects hear word pairs and an hour later are\ngiven the first word of each pair as a cue and are asked to remember\nthe second word.  Sid collects his data with the utmost care, and\nholds to the highest standards of data collection and interpretation.\nSuppose Sid does many such studies and concludes that his studies show\nthat in conditions C, memory for words that have been paired with\nwords that are used as cues is generally reliable.  Finally, suppose\nthat given his general assumptions, Sid is right in claiming\nthat his research indicates general reliability.  Still, in conducting\nhis research as he does, Sid depends on the general reliability of his\nown memory at many turns.  For example, in setting up the experiment,\nSid draws on his memory of the principles for conducting his research;\nin cuing the subjects and collecting the data of their responses, he\ndepends on his memory for believing that this group of people is the\nsame group of people to whom the lists were originally read;\ncollecting the data from the each person, Sid remembers not just that\nthis person is in the group, but also which person in the group this\nis, so that the data can be accurately recorded; finally, in drawing\nout the conclusions from his research, Sid must, at the very least,\nkeep in mind the procedures of the study, the summaries of the\nempirical data, and the principles guiding inductive inferences.   The problem here is perfectly general.  In order to construct an\nargument for anything that is not a simple syllogism (and perhaps even\nthen), one must depend on the reliability of one's memory for the\nearlier steps and for their justifications.  Therefore, if one wants\nto construct anything other than the simplest of arguments for the\nreliability of memory, one will have to depend on the reliability of\nmemory.  This means that any such argument is infected with a kind of\ncircularity: one will be able to construct such an argument only by\ndepending on the reliability of memory.  Of course, the inability to\nconstruct a noncircular argument for memory does not tend to show that\nmemory is unreliable.  William Alston (Alston 1986) has argued\nconvincingly that all of the basic epistemic processes share this\ncommon trait: their reliability cannot be shown without circularity.\nStill, we have no choice but to trust them and we shouldn't take our\ninability to offer a non-circular argument for them to impugn them in\nany way.","contact.mail":"senor@uark.edu","contact.domain":"uark.edu"}]
