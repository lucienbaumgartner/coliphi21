He spent his entire life in Bohemia (today\npart of the Czech Republic), which remained part of the Austrian\nEmpire until 1918. He studied philosophy, mathematics and theology and\nbecame a Catholic priest and professor of the science of religion at\nthe University of Prague. He devoted his life to the reform of the\nbackward semi-feudal Austrian society and of the a priori\nsciences: logic, mathematics and theology. Because of his unorthodox\nviews on the constitution and the government, he was removed in 1819\nfrom the University and spent the rest of his life in retirement\nwriting treatises on the theory of science (1837), mathematics\n(Grössenlehre, manuscript not yet completely\npublished), Science of Religion (1834), a utopia On the\nBest State (published only in 1932) and the posthumous Paradoxes of the\ninfinite (1851).\n\nBolzano's presentation of logic is embedded in the vast Theory\nof Science (henceforth TS). His logic is based on the\nabstract concepts of propositions and ideas in themselves (an\nsich), which are independent of thought and language. His logic\nof ideas contains a new treatment of their content and extension and,\namong other things, provides an analysis of ideas without objects. A\npurely logical definition of intuitions as simple singular ideas\nallowed Bolzano to distinguish them from concepts and to characterize\nthe traditional epistemological distinction between a priori\nand a posteriori in terms of the logical distinction between\nconceptual and empirical propositions (and sciences). The main\ninnovations of Bolzano's logic consist in the definitions of validity,\nanalyticity and logical truth, and the creation of a complete system\nof extensional relations between propositions, the most important of\nthese being compatibility, deducibility (= consequence), and\nequivalence. Bolzano discovered the link between deducibility and\nconditional probability, according to which deducibility and\nincompatibility appear as two limit cases of conditional probability\n(this idea was taken over or reinvented by Wittgenstein in\nthe Tractatus). Deductive logic is thus extended to inductive\nlogic based on probability. Bolzano's theory of the grounding relation\n(Abfolge) leading to a hierarchical order of theorems is the\nfirst modern study of axiomatic systems. Morover, the thorough\ndiscussions of concepts of logic and many other insights contribute to\nmake the TS one of the classical works in logic and\nepistemology, on a par with those of Aristotle, Leibniz, and Frege.\nThe extensive historical notes contained in it are a unique source for\nthe history of logic. Although written in natural language, Bolzano's\nlogic represents a decisive breakthrough in the development of modern\nlogic.\n\nIn 1810, Bolzano published a booklet entitled Contributions to\na better founded presentation of mathematics (Bolzano 1810;\nBolzano 2004b) where he developed his views about the unsatisfactory\nstate of the mathematics of his time and the need for its reform. He\nproposed a new definition of mathematics as “the science which\ndeals with the general laws (forms) to which things must conform in\ntheir existence” (Bolzano 1810, I, §8; Bolzano 2004b: 94),\na new division of mathematics into universal mathematics (arithmetic,\nalgebra, analysis and elements of his future theory of collections)\nand particular mathematical disciplines (mathematical theory of time,\ngeometry and mechanics), and also put forth some considerations on\nlogic. As with Leibniz, logic is again seen as closely connected with\nmathematics. The logical theory of the Contributions is still fairly\ntraditional, sometimes Kantian in spite of Bolzano's criticisms, but\nit contains some important innovations. Following Aristotle, Bolzano\ndistinguished two sorts of proofs: those which show that\nsomething is the case and those which also show why it is\nso. He called the former “certifications” (Bolzano 2004b:\n254: “confirmations”) [Gewissmachungen], the\nlatter “groundings” [Begründungen]. The\nconcept of grounding reflects the “objective dependence among\ntruths” [objektiver Zusammenhang der Wahrheiten].  It\nwould later become the fundamental concept in Bolzano's treatment of\naxiomatic theories in the TS. Another innovation consisted in\nthe criteria for the correctness of proofs and in the treatment of\nsimple, undefinable concepts. On one hand, already in\nthe Betrachtungen Bolzano pointed out that he “could\nnever be satisfied with a completely strict proof if it were not\nderived from the same concepts which the thesis to be\nproved contained” (Bolzano 2004b: 32). On the other hand,\n“[…] in any correct proof of [the] proposition all\ncharacteristics of the subject must be used, i.e., they must be\napplied in the derivation of the predicate” (Bolzano 1810, II,\n§28; Bolzano 2004b: 122–123). With Aristotle, Bolzano\nprohibits crossing from one genus to another in demonstrations. Proofs\nof theorems of mathematical analysis such as his proof of the\nintermediate value theorem (Bolzano 1817; Bolzano 2004b:\n252–277) must not contain concepts alien to the domain of\ninvestigation; in the case of this theorem, one must not introduce\ngeometrical or kinematic considerations to prove a theorem of\nuniversal (pure) mathematics. According to Bolzano, a mathematical theory should be presented in\nthe form of an axiomatic theory, whose propositions are deduced from\nprevious propositions according to their objective dependence and\neventually from the axioms. Axioms are not necessarily evident truths\nand intuition has no place either in the proofs or the axioms. An\naxiom is simply an indemonstrable proposition from which other\npropositions may be deduced. A science thus becomes an autonomous,\nordered system of propositions, independent of the human mind; the\ngoal of foundational research is to discover and to reproduce this\nobjective order. A further important innovation consists in the treatment of simple,\nundefinable concepts. How do we understand them? Our understanding \nis brought about by mentioning several sentences, in which the concept\nin question, designated by its own word, appears in various\ncombinations. From the comparison of these sentences, the reader is\nable to abstract which determinate concept the word\ndesignates. […] This means is well known as that by which each\nof us learned the first meanings of words in our mother tongue\n(Bolzano 1810, II, §8; Bolzano 2004b: 107; here Rusnock's 2000\ntranslation). Bolzano called such circumlocutions “paraphrases” or\n“circumscriptions” [Umschreibungen]. His method\npoints to a solution of the paradox of definition according to which\nall concepts are ultimately defined in terms of simple concepts, but\nthese remain undefined and thus devoid of meaning. Bolzano's new logic responded to the needs of both mathematics and\nthe “science of religion” which Bolzano taught from 1805\nto 1819. In 1812, profoundly dissatisfied with the state of logic,\nBolzano conceived the project of a new logic which would lead to a\n“total transformation of the a priori\nsciences”. The idea of the “objective connection of\ntruths”, based on the grounding relation of consequence\n[Abfolge] was the core of the project. The Theory of\nScience, published in 1837, marks the realization of the project,\nenlarged in the broader context of general epistemology and\nmethodology of science. Bolzano defined the theory of science by its ultimate goal, which\nis the division of human knowledge into disciplines and the\ncomposition of scientific treatises. According to the definition, the\ntheory of science is the collection of all rules which we must follow,\nif we want to do a competent piece of work, when we divide the total\ndomain of truths into individual sciences, and present them in their\nrespective treatises. (TS, I, §1, 9; Bolzano 1973: 38) Bolzano calls this last part of the TS\n the Theory of Science Proper. This definition presupposes a whole sequence of disciplines\ninvolved in the construction of a science, each of which is founded on\nthe preceding. The ultimate discipline in this sequence deals with the\nclassification of sciences and the principles of style of scientific\nwriting that should lead to the composition of a series of scientific\ntreatises forming an encyclopedia. Bolzano hoped that, following the\nGreat Encyclopedia of Diderot and D'Alembert, the ideal of the\nEnlightenment, the effort to spread scientifically organized useful\nknowledge would again find its finest expression in the completion of\nan encyclopedia. In this way, the TS, would contribute to the\ngeneral well-being. In order to divide truths into different disciplines and present\nthem in particular treatises, we first have to discover them. Such is\nthe goal of The Art of Discovery [Erfindungskunst]\nor Heuristics, which yields the rules for finding new truths.\nHeuristics presupposes the possibility of recognizing truths, which is\nthe object of The Theory of Knowledge\n[Erkenntnislehre]. Now, the decisive step in the exploration\nof the layers of science leads to the most important part of\nthe TS, The Theory of Elements, which analyses the\nobjective conditions of the subjective activity of knowing, namely the\ntheory of ideas, propositions and deduction, in short: formal\nlogic. The Theory of Fundamentals shows that these elements\nare propositions in themselves and ideas in themselves, that there are\ninfinitely many truths in themselves and that we can know at least\nsome of them. Taking all the disciplines of the TS in the due\norder, we obtain the following structure: Bolzano's terminology often differs from current logical usage. For\na proper understanding of Bolzano's logic, it is thus necessary to\nkeep in mind Bolzano's fundamental distinctions and definitions. This\nis why the presentation of Bolzano's logic must begin with the\nexamination of several preliminary concepts. The expression “in itself” [an sich] is\napplied only to propositions and ideas, never to things or\nmetaphysical objects such as the soul or God. Only logical objects are\n“in themselves”. The determination “in itself”\nor “as such” (a translation proposed recently by Jan Berg)\nwith its synonym “objective” means that we take an object\nwithout any other qualification, independently of its being thought or\nexpressed linguistically. Bolzano's term for ideas in themselves is\n‘representations in themselves’ [Vorstellungen an\nsich], and he even speaks of intuitions in themselves; he is\naware of the incongruity of such a designation, but he has no other\nterm to propose. For what we call—after Tarski—logical consequence,\nBolzano uses the word deducibility (Ableitbarkeit,\nliterally derivability, but it is a sort of semantical relation). He\ncalls consequence or entailment [Abfolge]\nthe ground-consequence relation [Grund und Folge]; with\nRusnock (Bolzano 2004a), I translate Abfolge\nby grounding. In English, the same word grounding is\nalso used for Begründung which is the objective\nproof, objektiver Beweis, carried out by means of the\ngrounding relation [Abfolge]. Thus, grounding\ntranslates both the Abfolge relation between the ground and\nthe consequence, and Begründung, the complete objective\nproof. Bolzano has two words to designate\nproperties: Beschaffenheit and Eigenschaft. In\ntranslation, the difference often disappears, but it is possible to\ncapture it by translating Beschaffenheit by\n“attribute”. An Eigenschaft is a property in the\nstrict sense; “attribute” is the general term for both\nproperties and relations, and also covers the states and structure of\nan object.  The ‘Beschaffenheit’ of a thing means\nhow it is beschaffen, made, organized, arranged, structured,\nconstituted. Nevertheless, often Beschaffenheit simply\ndesignates an Eigenschaft, a property. There are two fundamental kinds of objects in Bolzano's ontology:\nthe real ones, localized in space and time and subject to causality,\nand the non-real, logical and mathematical objects. Real objects are\nfurther divided into external and internal, subjective (mental\nevents). Thus, we have the first world of external, material things,\nthe second world of subjective states (mental events) and the third\nrealm of abstract meanings and mathematical objects; nevertheless, the\nultimate ontological division is between the real world\ncontaining substances, their collections, states and properties, and\nthe abstract realm of logical and mathematical objects. One can only say of real objects that they exist or have being in\nthe proper sense [Existenz, Dasein, Sein]. Bolzano marks the\ndifference in the modes of being of real and non-real objects by\nsaying that “there are [es gibt] non-real\nobjects”, although they do not exist. With Bergmann\n(1970) and other critics\nwho stress that we do not have different concepts of existence\naccording to the nature of the objects, I shall in both cases use the\nword “exist”. Both kinds of being, real and non real, can nevertheless be\nexpressed by means of an important second-level concept: objectuality\n[Gegenständlichkeit], a property of ideas expressing\nexistential quantification, the property of having an object. The idea\nof a function is just as objectual as the idea of a horse, but in the\ncase of the idea of a horse, one may add that it is an idea of a real\nbeing. The idea of a round square is objectless, without object, not\ninstantiated, because the existence of round squares implies a\ncontradiction. The idea of a golden mountain is objectless for\nempirical reasons. Surprisingly, Bolzano lacks a theory of quantification. He knows\nbetter than other mathematicians of his time how to treat quantifiers\nin his mathematical work (he was, for example, the first to give a\nviable definition of continutity, and to formulate the Bolzano-Cauchy\ncriterion for the convergence of infinite series) but he gives no\ntheoretical treatment of quantifiers in his logic. He considers that\nit is not necessary to prefix a universal quantifier to universal\npropositions. “Man is mortal” differs from “All men\nare mortal” only in grammatical expression; both sentences\nexpress the same proposition. Existential quantification is reduced to\nobjectuality, a property of second order. “There are inhabitants\non other planets” becomes “The idea of an inhabitant on\nother planets is objectual”. Bolzano's first important innovation in the TS, which is\nat the same time the most controversial, aims at the transformation of\nthe domain of logic. According to him, logic is not a theory of ideas\nand judgments in our mind, it is not an art de pensée\nin the sense of Arnauld's and Nicole's Port-Royal Logic or\nan exposition of the laws of thought. Logic is the theory of formal\nrelations between propositions in themselves (Sätze an\nsich; Bolzano also uses as a synonym “objective\npropositions”; here I shall simply use the term\n“proposition”). Bolzano does not succeed in defining what\nobjective propositions are; he can only characterize them by a set of\nspecific properties (see Berg 1962: 46–47). In contradistinction\nto judgments, which are mental acts, and to sentences, which are\nsequences of signs of a language, propositions form the\n“matter” of a thought or of a judgment as well as the\nmeaning or sense (Sinn) of a sentence. Bolzano points out\nthat ‘to be in itself’ is not a new property of\npropositions or ideas; it means simply to take a proposition or an\nidea as it is, independently of its being grasped or expressed by a\nhuman being. Conversely, thinking and speaking involve\n‘grasping’ (in the metaphorical sense) the meaning and\nexpressing it. \nOne will gather what I mean by proposition as soon as I remark that I\ndo not call a proposition in itself or an objective proposition that\nwhich the grammarians call a proposition, namely, the linguistic\nexpression, but rather simply the meaning of this expression, which\nmust be exactly one of the two, true or false; and that accordingly I\nattribute existence to the grasping of a proposition, to thought\npropositions as well as to the judgments made in the mind of a\nthinking being (existence, namely, in the mind of the one who thinks\nthis proposition and who makes the judgment); but the mere proposition\nin itself (or the objective proposition) I count among the kinds of\nthings that do not have any existence whatsoever, and never can attain\nexistence. (Bolzano 2004a: 40–41) Like mathematical objects, propositions are non-mental and\nnon-linguistic intensional entities; they do not belong to the real\nworld, but rather, as Bolzano puts it, to “the realm of those\nthings which make no claim to reality but only to possibility”\n(Bolzano 2004b: §13, 607). Contrary to other\nintensional objects, each proposition has a truth value, true or\nfalse. The best approach to Bolzano's concept of proposition (and of\nidea in itself) is to consider them as forming the universal realm of\nabstract meanings, from which each language selects specific meanings\nand associates signs with them. Against psychologism, especially that of Kant, Herbart, and others,\nBolzano propounded the concept of a proposition in order to prevent\nthe interpretation of logical objects as mental entities. Bolzano's\narguments in favor of the existence of propositions invoke the\nexistence of unknown truths or of truths that nobody except God will\never know (a truth is simply a true proposition). Such is, for\ninstance, the truth that a certain tree had determinate number of\nflowers last spring. But God's knowledge of that number does not mean\nthat propositions depend on his mind: propositions and truths, not\nbeing real, are not created by him. Something is true not because God knows that it is\nso; on the contrary, God knows that it is so because in fact it is\nso. (TS I: §25, 113–115)\n  The proposition “God exists” is not\ntrue because God thinks it; God thinks this because it is true. The most plausible argument in favor of the existence of\npropositions deals with mathematical truths: the Pythagorean theorem,\nfor example, is true independently of the language in which it is\nformulated, and does not even depend on the existence of thinking\nbeings. According to Morscher (1973: 278), Bolzano wanted to guarantee\nthe objectivity and universality of logic by means of\npropositions. Already during his life, Bolzano was obliged to defend his theory\nof propositions against the attacks of Franz Exner, who wrote to\nBolzano: Every truth exists only in the consciousness of an\n individual, in an individual understanding, nowhere else and in no\n other way. (Bolzano 2004a: 85)\n  Exner also speaks of the “ghostly\nbeing” of propositions. He objected that Bolzano's theory of\npropositions makes it a mystery how human beings, who belong to the\nreal world, grasp immaterial meanings. Bolzano replied that the word “grasp” as well as all similar\nwords [… ] are only figurative expressions used in the\nhope that anyone who understands the language can gather from the\nwhole context which simple [or almost simple]\nconcepts are designated with these words (Bolzano 2004a:\n162). Against Exner, again and again he puts forward as argument the\nexistence of unknown truths and the existence of meanings independent\nof any particular language. Much later, Frege, the early Husserl, Heinrich Scholz, Alonzo\nChurch, and Jerrold Katz advanced ideas similar to those of Bolzano,\nwhile Wittgenstein, Schlick, Patočka, Quine and others presented\nobjections based on the analysis of human, subjective representations\nand the use of language. For Patočka, who echoes Exner's\ncriticism, Bolzano's doctrine does not represent a\n solution.[…]. Bolzano's problem can be solved only if the\n first place in the sequence of the layers of science is occupied not\n by the mythical propositions in themselves, but by the critical\n doctrine of knowledge as a progressing and historical process. (1958:\n 120) On the other hand, in his Metaphysics of Meaning\n(1990), Katz exposed an\nessentially Bolzanian theory showing how to respond to Wittgensteinian\nand Quinian arguments. According to Katz, his critics mix up\nthe language with the use of the language. The\nmeanings constitute a universal field from which every language\nselects its own meanings, not necessarily the same for all\nlanguages. A balanced position is expressed in Rusnock (2000:\n115): \n[…] the question may fairly be asked whether Bolzano's view on\nlogical objects can be usefully adapted to the modern\nsetting—that is […] whether the notion of proposition is\nstill useful. […] In my opinion, this question turns mainly on\nthe issue of whether or not formal language theory is judged to have\ngiven an exhaustive description of possible forms of\nmeaningfulness. If so, it would seem that propositions as entities\nover and above formal expressions would yield nothing that one did not\nalready possess in a more precise form. On the other hand, if the\nquestion of analysis of possible forms of meaning remains open, then\nBolzano's position, suitably adapted, becomes more reasonable.  And\nthe latter, it seems to me, is closer to the truth. […] when\nconsiderations of tractability, perspicuity, elegance, etc. are\nintroduced, the question becomes once again interestingly\nopen. Bolzano's concept of proposition also includes orders, questions\nand expressions of desire. A question like “Is Newton's law of\nuniversal gravitation an a priori truth?” means\n“I want to know if Newton's law of universal gravitation is\nan a priori truth” and it has a truth value. Here and\nin similar cases, Bolzano confuses the question of truth with the\nsincerity of the speaker. What is truth? Truths are true propositions. Bolzano's theory is\nessentially Aristotelian: true propositions “state things as\nthey are” (TS I: §25, 112; 1972: 32). A\nproposition is true if it says how things are. More precisely, \nA proposition is true when it attributes to a subject a predicate that\nit possesses, or (in other words) when every object that stands under\nthe subject concept of the proposition has an attribute that stands\nunder the predicate concept. I do not usually like to speak\nof agreement on such occasions. (Bolzano 2004a (letter to\nExner): 167) This formulation is linked to the canonical form of all\npropositions “A has (the attribute) b” (see\nbelow). Moreover, empirical propositions must contain determinations\nof space and time. Without these determinations, the sentence\n“It is snowing” has no truth value, it is just a\npropositional form which does not correspond to a complete\nproposition; in order to be true, such propositions require the\naddition of such specifications as to time (and oftentimes also a\nlocation), “In this place, it is snowing\ntoday”. (TS I: §25, 113; Bolzano 1973:\n57) There are infinitely many truths in themselves. Bolzano proposed\nseveral proofs for this claim, the simplest being the following. Let\nus take as a first proposition p, e.g., that “there is no\ntruth”. Then if p is true, it is our first truth;\nif p is false, some other proposition is true, e.g.,\nnon-p. Thus there is at least one truth. Now,\n“p is true” is our second truth,\ndifferent from the first one, because it has a different subject and\ndifferent predicate than those of p;\n“ ‘p is true’ is true” is\nour third truth, and so on ad infinitum. If p if\nfalse, we have the same argument starting with non-p. Other\nproofs, by complete induction, are more sophisticated, but hardly more\nconvincing. Traditional logic begins with concepts or ideas, moves on to\njudgments and ends with reasoning (syllogisms, arguments). Bolzano\nreversed this order with regard to ideas and\npropositions. Propositions are composed of ideas, but for Bolzano,\npropositions are primary, undefined objects, and ideas in themselves\n[Vorstellungen an sich; hereafter just ideas in\ncontradistinction to subjective ideas] are defined as parts of\npropositions that are not themselves propositions. This is an\nimportant innovation, which appears already in Kant (see Coffa 1991),\nbecause it allows one to grasp the meaning of a term in a sentence\nfrom the context of the whole sentence, and authorizes concept\nformation from sentential forms obtained from propositions by\ndeclaring one or several of its components variable. Ideas do not have truth values. They can nevertheless contain whole\npropositions as parts, e.g., the idea of “the astronomer who discovered\nthat the planets have elliptic orbits”. They have the same\nontological status as propositions: they are the “stuff”\nof subjective ideas, they do not belong to the real world, they can\nonly be grasped by a mind and thus be thought by means of subjective\nideas. To every subjective idea belongs an objective one which is what\nis thought by the subjective idea (see TS I: §48,\n158). Ideas can be simple or composed of other ideas. The non-ordered set\nor the sum of the parts of a complex idea is its content.\nThe parts of an idea form a sum, i.e., according to Bolzano's\ndefinition, a collection in which “the parts of a part are parts\nof the whole”. His definition means that the content of an idea\nis invariant with respect to substitutions of the system or sequence\nof simpler parts of a part for that part. Thus, substituting\n“divisible by 2” for “even” in “even\nnumber”, we obtain “number divisible by 2” which has\nthe same content. On the other hand, two different ideas may have the same content.\n“The learned son of an unlearned father” and “the\nunlearned son of a learned father” for instance have the same\ncontent. An idea is therefore not determined solely by its content.\nIts complete determination requires its content and the order of the\nparts. In their ultimate form, many ideas are systems or sequences of\nsimple ideas which form their content. Nevertheless, in certain ideas\nhaving the form “A which has the properties \\(b, b',\nb'',\\ldots\\)”, no linear ordering is supposed between the parts\n\\(b, b', b'',\\ldots\\). All complex ideas can in principle be analyzed into their ultimate\nparts which are simple. Bolzano does not give a list of simple ideas\nbut occasionally conjectures that a given idea is simple.  Among\nothers, the following ideas are claimed to be simple:\n“something”, “attribute”, “being”,\n“composition” (Zusammengesetzheit, which is the\nprimitive idea allowing one to define collections and sets as\n“something which has composition”), “to grasp or\napprehend”, “not”, “ought”. There are a variety of ways of conveying the meaning of\nexpressions.  Definitions in a broad sense start with explanations,\nand explanations are divided into contextual definitions of simple\nconcepts (or of concepts that we are not able to define) and\ndefinitions in the strict sense, namely the decompositions of a\nconcept into its parts. Each concept has a unique definition. A given\ndecomposition may or may not attain the ultimate parts, but different\npartial decompositions and the complete decomposition into ultimate\nparts define the same concept. As we have seen, already before\nGergonne and Jeremy Bentham, Bolzano advanced the idea of contextual\ndefinitions in the Contributions (1810): we grasp the meaning\nof a sign designating a simple idea “from its use” or\n“from the context” (Bolzano 2004b: 107; the quotation is\nfrom TS IV: §668, 547).  Complete determinations are\nsimilar to definitions: they state an exclusive, characteristic\nproperty of an object and yield thus a concept equivalent to the\ndefined concept. Another important division concerns the division of attributes\n[Beschaffenheiten] into internal properties, expressed by\nmonadic predicates, and external properties, i.e., relations, which in\nfact correspond to internal properties of the whole composed from the\nrelated parts. In the fundamental idiom, which approximates closely\nthe structure of propositions, “A is the father\nof B” should be translated as “The whole which\ncontains A and B has the following property: the\nfirst element is the father of the second”. In fact, Bolzano\ntransfers the weight of the relation to the predicate. Here are two\nexamples of something which looks like a property but is in fact a\nrelation: the attribute of being prime, which is a relation between a\nprime number and all other natural numbers, and sensible qualities,\nwhich are not internal properties but relations between external\nthings and sense organs. Thus, “a is red” becomes\n“in relation to our sense organ of vision, a is\nred”. Two theorems, or rather simply observations, govern Bolzano's\ntheory of ideas. They invalidate theories of some of Bolzano's\ncontemporaries or predecessors by means of counterexamples. (1) The\nparts of an idea are not necessarily the ideas of the parts\nof their object. In the example “roof of a house”, the\nidea “house” is not the idea of a part of the roof of the\nhouse. (2) The parts of an idea are not always ideas of\nthe properties of their object. The idea\n“\\(\\sqrt{2}\\)”, for instance has parts such as\n“root”, “square”, “of” and\n“2”, but none of the infinity of its properties is\nrepresented by any of these parts.  In any case, many complex ideas\ncontain also logical particles (e.g., “which”,\n“of”) that connect their parts and can be neither ideas of\nthe parts nor ideas of the properties of the object. Both observations\nshow that the traditional formation of concepts by mere agglomeration\nof characters does not exhaust the multiple ways that concepts are\nformed. Moreover, both refute not only all naive picture theories of\nknowledge, but also, as Joëlle Proust (1999: 370–377) has noted, the\nLeibnizian idea of isomorphism between signs and things. The examples\nquoted by Bolzano show that there is no direct correspondence between\nthe composition of things and the compositions of the ideas that\nrepresent them.  Ideas are not images of their objects. The relation of an idea to its object is primitive, hence\nindefinable relation. Ideas may have or represent or refer to one or\nmore objects; these are called objectual\n[gegenständlich].  Others represent no object, they are\nobjectless, empty [gegenstandslos, leer]. Bolzano supposes\nthat for any object there is an idea that represents it uniquely. An\nidea of an idea is called symbolic. Examples of the first kind: ideas like “Greek” (each\nGreek is one of its objects), “black”,\n“universe”, “prime number”; of the second kind\nare ideas like “nothing”, “round square”,\n“regular pentahedron”, “golden mountain”\n(empirically empty), logical particles such as “has” or\n“which”, and curiously also ideas of\n“imaginary” (complex) numbers like \\(\\sqrt{-1}\\). Objects\nof ideas may be real, e.g., real beings or their properties\n(“man”, “virtue”), but also not real, as in\nthe case of logical and mathematical objects\n(“proposition”, “deducibility”,\n“number”, “function”). Altogether, we have the\nfollowing relations: Before Frege, Husserl and others, Bolzano carefully distinguished\nbetween subsumption (in set-theoretical terminology: to be an element\nof a set) and subordination (to be a subset). Loosely speaking, the extension of an idea is “the\ncollection of all the objects falling under it” (Bolzano 2004a:\n46), but strictly speaking, it is “that particular attribute of\nan idea by virtue of which it represents only those and no other\nobjects” (TS I, §66, 298; Bolzano 1973: 104). That particular\ninternal property mediates the association of a collection (the\nextension) with an idea. In this manner, Bolzano wants to stress the\ninternal link between ideas and their extensions, and the uniqueness\nof the extension of each idea; moreover, simple ideas are individuated\nby their extensions (ibid., 299; Bolzano 1973: 105). The fact that the idea of prime number represents all prime numbers\nis thus an internal property of this idea, that is, it is not a\nrelation (the concept of prime number is a relational one, but its\nextension is a property). In practice, however, Bolzano takes the\nextension of an idea to be a collection of all its objects. Each objectual idea has a unique extension, and only objectual\nideas have an extension (in other words, Bolzano does not recognize\nthe empty collection or set). Objectual ideas are divided into singular (e.g., “God”,\n“universe”, “Aristotle”, “my actual\nintuition of the pleasant fragrance of this rose”, “even\nprime number”) and general (“animal”,\n“substance”, “quantity”). Against the law of inverse relation between content and extension\nof ideas, advocated by logicians since Arnauld and\nNicole's Port-Royal Logic, Bolzano invokes the existence of\nredundant ideas (e.g., “triangular figure which has\nangles”) and of contradictory ideas, which have content, but no\nextension. The following example aroused criticism and even provoked a\ncontroversy (see Šebestik 1992: 151–152): the idea “man\nwho knows all living European languages” has at the same time a\nlarger content and a larger extension than the idea “man who\nknows all European languages”. Rusnock (2000) proposed a less\ncontroversial example: the idea “1” has both smaller\ncontent and smaller extension than the idea “solution of the\nequation \\(x^2 - 1= 0\\)”. The rule of the inverse relation between\ncontent and extension nevertheless holds in the case of concepts\nformed by the conjunction of characteristics. Bolzano takes over Kant's distinction between two kinds of ideas,\nintuitions and concepts, but rejects Kant's definitions. For Bolzano,\na pure concept is an idea that is not an intuition and does not\ncontain an intuition as a part. To these two kinds, Bolzano adds a\nthird: the mixed ideas, which contain both concepts and\nintuitions as parts.  As pure concepts play an important role in\nBolzano's theory of science, mathematics, for example, being a purely\nconceptual science, everything depends on how intuitions are\ndefined. Although many subjective intuitions are indirectly produced by the\naction of an external object that causes a sensation in us, they\ncorrespond to ideas in themselves. There are intuitions in themselves\nbecause intuitions can be parts of propositions and thus have the same\nobjective status as other ideas. For this reason, Bolzano cannot\ndefine them by means of subjective intuitions, which are mental\nevents. He advances a definition in purely objective terms: an\nintuition is nothing other than a simple singular idea,\nsimple with respect to content, singular with respect to\nextension. According to Kant, intuitions are singular (subjective)\nrepresentations, but according to his definition, even ideas expressed\nby a proper name like “Alexander the Great” or\n“Sirius” would be intuitions. Bolzano's subjective\nintuitions are just ideas of the immediate effect of an external\nobject on our sensibility; they represent the change aroused in\nourselves on that occasion. Subjective intuitions are representations\nof sensations and other mental events, and intuitions in themselves\ntheir objective counterparts. The object of an intuition is always\nreal, but one should not confuse it with the external object. The\nsingular idea of a physical object, e.g., the idea “Alexander\nthe Great”, cannot be an intuition, because it contains both\nintuitions and concepts. In fact, we infer the existence of an\nexternal object from the intuitions we receive due to its causal\naction.  […] we infer that there is an outer object\nacting on us only because a certain change in our inner self takes\nplace, a change that we interpret as the object's effect on\nus. (Bolzano 2004a: 50) Expressed in words, an intuition is the idea of “this, which\noccurs in me just now, which I just now see or hear or feel” and\nits object is just “that change that then takes place in\nus” and nothing else (ibid.).  The uniqueness of that\nchange means that its idea is singular. Despite the fact that verbal expressions of intuitions usually\ncontain several words, intuitions are simple ideas. In fact, the only\nword that designates an intuition is the demonstrative\n“this” [dies], the rest of the expression being\njust a redundancy, because “the object that it represents\nremains throughout the same single one, whether we think the additions\nor not” (ibid. 51). Thus, in the idea “this\nred”, the part “red” does nothing to narrow the\nextension; the remaining part, “this”, is simple and,\nbeing singular, is an intuition.  As a consequence, concepts may be singular, but complex (e.g.,\n“God”, “7”), or simple, but either objectless\nor general (i.e., having no object at all or more than one)\n(“round square” has no object, “proposition”\nhas infinitely many objects). Proper names, which can be expressed by\nmeans of definite descriptions, always designate mixed ideas; the\nintuitions present in the idea “Socrates”, for example,\nmight represent the sounds of which the name is composed. Propositions containing only pure concepts are called conceptual\npropositions; those containing intuitions are called empirical\npropositions. This classification of propositions, founded only on the\nstructural properties of ideas, is the logical counterpart of Kant's\ndistinction between a priori and a posteriori\njudgments, which is relative to the origin of the ideas that occur in\nthem and is defined in subjective terms\n(TS II,\n§§133, 306).\n\n Of the two main parts of Bolzano's formal logic, the extensional\nlogic of ideas (the logic of classes) and the extensional logic of\npropositions, the first part comes from a long tradition beginning\nwith Boethius (and derived from Aristotelian syllogistic) and\nending — in Bolzano's times — with Gergonne. Bolzano did not\ntake his logic of ideas from Gergonne or Euler, the most influential\nauthors in their time, but rather from a small booklet Outline of\nLogic (Grundriss\nder Logik) by a now completely forgotten logician, J.G.E. Maass,\npublished in 1793. Bolzano's fundamental schema of extensional relations between ideas\ncan already be found in Maass' Logic. Bolzano made some\nmodifications and generalized it to relations between classes of ideas\nand also to relations between empty (objectless) ideas. This last\ngeneralization is important for Bolzano's propositional logic: the\nrelations between empty ideas are defined by means of the method of\nvariation that appears here for the first time in the TS. Bolzano defined a system of relations between the extensions of\nideas. The first relations he defines are compatibility\n[Verträglichkeit] and its negation, incompatibility.\nTwo ideas A and B are compatible if they have\n(represent) at least one object in common, i.e., if at least one\nobject falls under both A and B. In the case in which\nnot only some but all objects represented by A are also\nrepresented by B, A is included in B.  If this\nrelation is reciprocal, i.e., if A is included in B\nand B included in A, the ideas A and B are\nequivalent (coextensive). Further, we have two special cases: proper\ncompatibility, i.e., compatibility where neither A is included\nin B, nor B in A; this relation is called by\nBolzano overlapping or linking [Verschlungenheit oder\nVerkettung]. Another is subordination [Unterordnung]\nwhich is proper inclusion, without reciprocity. The negative cases give rise to three kinds of incompatibility:\nexclusion (omnilateral incompatibility), contradiction and contrariety\n(incompatibility without contradiction). Exclusion\n[Ausschliessung] differs from incompatibility only in\ncomparing three or more ideas or collections of ideas: the\nideas A, B, C, … exclude each other if\nthey are incompatible and if not even two of them are compatible with\neach other.  The ideas A and B are contradictory if B \"will have an extension that includes everything that does not stand under the idea A\" (TS II, §103, 477), i.e. if B is equivalent to not-A. Contrary to Bolzano, who defines contradiction only for objectual ideas whose extension is not of the greatest extent, I simplify his system admitting also universal ideas such as “something in general” [Etwas überhaupt], objectless ideas and their extensions (for Bolzano, objectless ideas have no extension). As all these relations are derived from compatibility and its\nnegation, it is possible to represent both the relations between ideas\nand those between propositions in the form of a genealogical tree (see\nŠebestik 1992: 174 and 238). Here are only the definitions of the most important of\nthem for pairs of objectual ideas, written in our symbolic language. Bolzano's logic of extensional relations between propositions\nrepresents a major innovation which has no equivalent in traditional\nlogic. It is based on what is called the method of variation. Its\nfundamental concepts are defined by means of propositional or rather\nsentential forms. The method of variation consists in the substitution of appropriate\nideas for variables at the places indicated by some sentential form\nand the examination of the truth values of the resulting\npropositions. According to Bolzano, logical relations imply some\nvariation in the propositions which they connect. The sentential form\n[Satzform] is a linguistic expression obtained from a\nproposition, or rather from a sentence which expresses it, by\nconsidering some of its parts variable. This characteristic Bolzanian concept has, so to speak, two faces.\nSometimes, Bolzano expresses it by means of letters: “A\nhas [the property] b” or “A\nis B”. But very often, he simply writes “Caius has\nwisdom and in this proposition, the idea Caius is\nvariable”. These two ways of writing correspond to two different\nlevels. On the first, linguistic level, we deal with proper sentential\nforms, i.e., with expressions containing variables, which become\nsentences (and express propositions) after appropriate substitutions\nare made. When we write sentential forms, we do not write incomplete\npropositions, because there are no such entities. We write only\n“satzähnliche Verbindungen”, combinations of\nsigns which resemble propositions. The second level is the level of\npropositions and ideas in themselves, the level of meaning. Here,\nBolzano cannot use variables, letters or other indeterminate signs.\nIn the realm of the propositions and ideas in themselves, there are no\nindeterminate entities that would correspond to sentential forms;\nthere are only propositions, true or false. This might be the reason\nfor Bolzano's cumbersome way of speaking about “the\nidea Caius considered variable”. For Bolzano, the use\nof genuine sentential forms is just a convenient linguistic procedure\nyielding results which can be interpreted in terms of propositions.\nSpeaking of substitutions in sentential forms is then nothing more\nthan a façon de parler about atemporal relations\nbetween species of propositions. Bolzano's loose manner of speaking\nabout substitutions of ideas in a sentential form instead of speaking\nabout their linguistic expressions is adopted in what follows. To\nconsider one or several ideas in a given proposition variable means to\ntake the class of all propositions which have the same structure and\ncontain the same ideas except at places occupied by the\n“variable ideas”. This is the sense of Bolzano's\nidentification of a propositional form with a species or class of\npropositions, proposed already in the Contributions in 1810,\nand confirmed by several passages of the TS. A sentential\nform, or equivalently the corresponding proposition “in which\ncertain ideas are considered variable”, can generate a whole\nclass of propositions if appropriate ideas are substituted for the\nvariable ideas. A proposition which results from such a substitution\nperformed on the given proposition (on the given sentential form) is\ncalled a variant. As in the case of mathematical functions,\nBolzano insists that speaking about variation is only metaphorical.\nThere is no actual variation, no change in time, only atemporal\nrelations between a proposition, the class of ideas admitted for\nsubstitution, and the class of propositions resulting from the\nsuccessive substitutions. Simultaneous substitutions for several\n“variable ideas” in the same proposition also have their\nplace in Bolzano's logic. Which ideas are admitted for variation? Siebel thinks that  in Bolzano, the variable and the constant ideas\nmay come from the logical domain as well as from the non-logical\ndomain. (1996: 195) If, however, we take into account Bolzano's practice, we\nnotice that Bolzano never varies logical and mathematical\nideas other than ideas of numbers and quantities, although he never\nforbids it (one could for instance conceive of the variation of some\npropositional connectives, others staying constant). Another critical point of Bolzano's theory requires elucidation:\nthe notion of “appropriate” substitution (substitution of\nappropriate ideas). Bolzano's only explicit criterion is the objectual\ncharacter of the resulting proposition (i.e., the objectuality of its\nsubject-idea). Some other constraints are needed in his logic of\nprobability: the set of ideas admitted for substitution in a\nproposition must contain only non-equivalent ideas. The ideas admitted for substitution cannot transform an objectual\nproposition into an empty (non-objectual) one. In the proposition\n“the man Caius is mortal”, I may substitute\n“Sempronius”, “Titus”, etc. for\n“Caius” and obtain true propositions. On the other hand, if we take some other idea,\ne.g., “rose” or “triangle”, then the\nproposition that emerges not only has no truth, it does not even have\nobjectuality, (TS II: §147, 79; Bolzano 1973: 189)\n  because their subject-ideas “the man\nrose” and “the man triangle” are empty. If we begin\nwith the proposition “Caius is mortal”, by contrast, the\nsubstitution of “rose” for “Caius” yields an\nobjectual proposition which is moreover true. Validity and other logical properties and relations are defined\nonly under the assumption of admissible substitutions. Two concepts prepare the construction of the logical system:\nvalidity and analyticity. When the method of variation is applied to a\nproposition, three different cases may arise: either the class of\npropositions obtained by substitution contains only true propositions,\nor it contains only false propositions, or it contains both true and\nfalse propositions. In the first case, the initial proposition is\ncalled universally valid (relative to given variables), in\nthe second universally invalid.  Bolzano does not give a name\nto the third case; such propositions could be called neutral. Here are\nsome examples: \nThe man Caius is mortal\n is universally valid relative to the variable idea\n“Caius” because each appropriate substitution generates a\ntrue proposition, or alternatively, because all its objectual variants\nare true. \nThe man Caius is omniscient is universally invalid relative to the same variable idea\n“Caius”, because all its variants are false.  The same proposition \nThe man Caius is omniscient is neutral relative to the variable idea “omniscient”,\nbecause some of its variants are true (e.g., the first example quoted)\nwhile others are false (the second example). The degree of validity [Grad der Gültigkeit] of a\nproposition relative to chosen variables is the ratio of the number\nof true propositions obtained by variation to the number\nof all propositions obtained. There may be an infinity of\npropositions in either case, but here, constraints on the admissible\nsubstitutions apply and above all, Bolzano only considers propositions\nhaving a finite number of variants. As an example, let us take the\nproposition “2, which is a number between 1 and 10, is\nprime” and vary 2: its degree of validity is 2/5. The degree of\nvalidity of a proposition is a number from the closed interval\n[0,1]. It is 1 for valid propositions, 0 for invalid propositions and\na proper fraction for other propositions. Properly speaking, Bolzano's concept of universal validity is not a\nlogical notion. It depends on specifically chosen variables. To obtain\nwhat we call a logical truth (Bolzano used the term ‘logically\nanalytic’), he defined another preliminary notion:\nanalyticity. Bolzano's analyticity is not our analyticity, and can be\nexplained as a generalization of his notion of validity (Bolzano's\nterm is “universal validity” [allgemeine\nGültigkeit]; as this notion is relative to ideas considered\nvariable, I prefer to use simply the term “validity”).\nValid propositions are those whose variants relative to the given\nvariables are all true. Analytic propositions are those which contain\nat least one variable idea such that the resulting variants are either\nall true (analytically true propositions) or all false (analytically\nfalse propositions). Such a definition implies a very broad conception\nof analyticity, as is shown by the following example: \nA morally evil man enjoys eternal happiness. It is analytically false, because it contains the idea\n“man” relative to which all the variants are false. Beside its own merits (mathematics is full of such propositions),\nthis kind of analyticity is an intermediate step towards logical\nanalyticity. After quoting such examples as “A\nis A”, “A which is B\nis A”, “Every object is B or\nnot B”, Bolzano also defines logically analytic\npropositions. They are propositions whose only invariable parts are\nlogical ideas. The logically analytic true propositions are instances\nof logical laws. Bolzano does not give a definition or a list of logical concepts\npermitting to separate them from non-logical ideas. He simply says  that nothing is necessary for judging the analytic\nnature of [the previous examples] besides logical knowledge, because\nthe concepts that make up the invariant part of these propositions all\nbelong to logic. (TS II: §148.3, 84; Bolzano 1973:\n193) Nevertheless, he is aware of the difficulty to separate logical and\nnon-logical ideas: the “domain of concepts belonging to logic is\nnot circumscribed to the extent that controversies could not arise at\ntimes” (ibid.). The main problems arise from the\nconfrontation of Bolzano's definition with his examples. He declares\nsome of them analytic by means of problematic definitions (example:\n“every effect has a cause”). The examples of §447 are\nanalytically true: “the soul of Socrates is a simple\nsubstance” (the variable idea being “Socrates”),\n“the angles of an equilateral triangle make altogether two right\nangles” (analytic with the variable idea\n“equilateral”), “if \\(a^2/2=b\\), then \\(a = \\pm\n\\sqrt{2b}\\)” (the variable idea is “2”), but the\ngeneral truths from which they follow are synthetic: “every soul\nis a simple substance” (even though a soul is defined as a kind\nof simple substance), “the angles of each triangle make\naltogether two right angles”, “if \\(a^2/c = b\\), then \\(a\n= \\pm\\sqrt{cb}\\)”. The construction of the system is based on the method of variation:\nthe different logical relations between propositions or classes of\npropositions are defined by means of relations between classes of\ntheir true variants. As in the case of validity, these relations are\nfirst defined relative to given variables; afterwards, in some\nparticularly important cases such as deducibility, Bolzano defines\nthem in an absolute way, i.e., relative to all non-logical ideas. Bolzano's system of extensional propositional logic is closely\nconnected with his extensional logic of ideas. In most cases, the same\nterminology is used for relations between ideas as for relations\nbetween propositions: this is the case for compatibility,\nsubordination, equivalence, exclusion, contradiction, contrariety and\nothers. Moreover, in a crucial passage, Bolzano sets up a\ncorrespondence between the truth values of propositions and the\nobjectuality and emptiness of ideas: With ideas, the crucial question was whether or not a certain\nobject is indeed represented by them; the corresponding question for\npropositions is whether or not they are true.  Just as I have called\nideas compatible or incompatible with each other, depending on whether\nor not they have certain objects in common, so I call propositions\ncompatible or incompatible, depending on whether or not there are\ncertain ideas which make all of them true. (TS II: §154,\n101; Bolzano 1973: 198–199) How are extensional relations between propositions obtained from\nthose between ideas? In order to transfer the relations between ideas\nto propositions, Bolzano has to resort to the method of variation: to\nthe referring relation between an idea and its object will\nthen correspond the verifying relation between an idea and a\npropositional form (or, in the fundamental idiom, between one or more\nideas and a proposition in which one or more ideas are considered\nvariable). Now Bolzano can define compatibility for propositions in complete\nanalogy with compatibility for ideas: The\npropositions A, B, C, D, … are all\nmutually compatible with respect to the variable\nideas i, j, … common to all of them if there is a\nsequence of ideas which, substituted for the\nvariables i, j, …, makes all these propositions\ntrue (ibid.). To the existence (or non-existence) of an object\nrepresented by each of the compatible (or incompatible) ideas\ncorresponds the existence (or non-existence) of an idea or a sequence\nof ideas which make each of the compatible (or incompatible)\npropositions true. The examples quoted by Bolzano suggest a simplification of the\ncorrespondence between ideas and propositions by applying a concept\nused by Bolzano on several occasions, though not systematically: the\nconcept of the system of ideas whose substitution for i,\nj…, makes all of A, B, C, D… true\n(“Inbegriff von Vorstellungen, welche die Sätze A, B,\nC, D, … wahr machen”; TS II: §155,\n114, 122, and §156, 133). More precisely, such a system of\nverifying ideas \\(\\mathbf{VA}(\\mathbf{i})\\) for the sentential forms\n\\(\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{i}) = (A(i, j, \\ldots), B(i, j, \\ldots), C(i, j,\n\\ldots), \\ldots)\\) is the set of the sequences of ideas that make the\nsentential forms \\(\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{i})\\) true (bold letters\nrepresent sets or sequences, ordinary letters single predicates or\nvariables).  Two examples: the system of verifying ideas for the\nproposition A “Caesar was a good citizen”,\nrelative to the variable “Caesar”, is \\(\\mathbf{V}A\\)\n(Caesar) = {Socrates, Aristeides, …}. Such a system for the\nproposition “Romeo loves Juliet” or, alternatively, for\nthe sentential form “Loves (i, j)” is\n\\(\\mathbf{V}L(i, j) = \\{\\langle\\)Othello, Desdemona\\(\\rangle,\n\\langle\\)Romeo, Juliet\\(\\rangle, \\langle\\)Juliet, Romeo\\(\\rangle,\n\\langle\\)Goethe, Lotte\\(\\rangle, \\ldots\\}\\). Bolzano's examples of compatible propositions are like the\nfollowing: let A be “a lion is a\nmammal”, B “a lion has two\nwings”. Then A and B are compatible with\nrespect to the variable idea “lion”.  There is indeed an\nidea which makes both A and B true; the system of\nverifying ideas of A and the system of verifying ideas\nof B contain both the idea “bat”: \nVA(lion) = {man, dog, lion, bat, …},\nVB(lion) = {swallow, eagle, bat, …} In this example, the two propositions are compatible because the\nsame idea “bat” makes both true. Bolzano's compatibility\nis our simultaneous realizability or satisfiability. Now it is possible to propose the following definition of\ncompatible propositions: Two propositions A and B\nare compatible if their systems of verifying ideas are\ncompatible in the sense of the logic of classes: \nA(i) and B(i) are compatible if\n\\(\\mathbf{V} A(\\mathbf{i}) \\cap\n\\mathbf{V}B(\\mathbf{i}) \\not= \\emptyset\\). All extensional logical relations between propositions can now be\nconstructed by means of elementary set-theoretical relations between\ntheir systems of verifying ideas. The result is a genealogical tree\nwhose fundamental structure is exactly the same as the structure of\nthe tree representing the relations between ideas. In order to stress\nthe correspondence between ideas and propositions Bolzano uses the\nsame terms (except deducibility) for the relations between ideas and\nthose between propositions. As before, i is the\nsequence of variable ideas\n(i, j…); A(i)\n=\n(A(i), B(i), C(i),\n…); M(i) =\n(M(i), N(i), O(i),\n…). In the following definitions, variables are omitted; the\nreader may supply them or may consider the defined relations as\nlogical relations strict sense, all non-logical terms being\ntaken as variables; the systems of verifying ideas have to be adapted\naccordingly. As in the case of the logic of classes, Bolzano\nconstructed the complete system of extensional relations between\npropositions; here only the most important ones are given. A is compatible with M \n\\((\\mathbf{VA} \\cap \\mathbf{VM} \\not= \\emptyset)\\) M is deducible [ableitbar]\nfrom A  (the sets of\npropositions A and M are compatible\nand \\(\\mathbf{VA} \\subset \\mathbf{VM}\\)) A is equivalent to M \n(A is deducible from M\nand M is deducible from A, i.e.,\n\\(\\mathbf{VA} = \\mathbf{VM}\\)) A is incompatible with M \n\\((\\mathbf{VA} \\cap \\mathbf{VM} = \\emptyset)\\) A and M are contradictory \n(\\(\\neg\\mathbf{A}\\) is equivalent to M\nand A equivalent to \\(\\neg\\mathbf{M}\\), i.e.,\n\\(\\mathbf{VA} = \\mathbf{V} \\neg\\mathbf{M}\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{V}\\neg\\mathbf{A}= \\mathbf{VM}\\)) Bolzano's system of relations between propositions is constructed\nfrom the extensional relations between ideas as defined in the\nMaass-Bolzano logic of classes. The concept of a system of verifying\nideas plays a crucial role in the systematic reconstruction of\nBolzano's variation logic. Both the class-logical relations and the relations between\npropositions are constructed from the initial relation of\ncompatibility by adding specific conditions to previously defined\nrelations. Compatibility is thus the basic relation of Bolzano's\nextensional logic. It is embedded in the very foundations of his\nsystem and all other relations (with the exception of different cases\nof disjunction, TS II, §160), deducibility included, are special cases\nof it. Bolzano considered the relation of deducibility “the most\nimportant concept of logic”. One especially noteworthy case occurs, however, if\nnot just some, but all of the ideas that, when substituted\nfor i, j,…\nin A, B, C, … make all these true,\nalso make all of M, N, O, …. true\n[…] with respect to the variable parts i, j,\n…. (Bolzano 2004: 54)  Note that Bolzano's definition, in agreement with Aristotle but\ncontrary to the modern concept of logical consequence, requires\ncompatibility. For Bolzano, it is impossible to deduce anything from contradictory\npremises (see Berg 1962 and 1992: 82); in particular, nothing follows\nfrom the premise \\(A\\not=A\\). It is nevertheless possible to deduce\nfrom false non-contradictory premises. In the general case, Bolzano's deducibility is a triadic relation\nbetween the premises, the conclusion and the variable ideas. Our logic\nfocuses immediately on the variation of all and only non-logical\nelements, but Bolzano's concept is very useful allowing one to make\ndeductions in a domain whose non-logical concepts are not submitted to\nvariation. Let us examine some examples: The relation of deducibility in the general sense holds\nbetween the premise: “Leipzig is north of Dresden (both places being in the northern hemisphere)” and the conclusion: “In winter, the days are shorter in Leipzig than in Dresden”. Such a deduction works with two variable ideas,\n“Leipzig” and “Dresden”, and depends also on\nastronomical knowledge. The next example shows logical deducibility where the only\ninvariable ideas are logical concepts: Notice that Bolzano uses the predicate “it is false\nthat” as a synonym for the logical particle\n“not”. He has no concept of metalanguage and in the same\nsentence or formula may appear concepts that we would qualify as\nbelonging to metalanguage. This distinction is immaterial for singular\nsentences, but it becomes relevant for sequences of propositions:  when it comes to propositional sequences of more than\none term, we have to distinguish between False(S) and non-S. \n(Berg 1962: 134; see also p. 138). Bolzano's adherence to Aristotelian tradition has some slight\ndrawbacks. The requirement that the premises be compatible complicates\nsome inferences. Against Herbart and Fries, Bolzano thinks that\ncontraposition requires a supplementary premise: From\n“all X are Y”, it is possible to deduce\n“all not-Y are not-X” only if we add as\npremise “the idea not-Y is not empty”. Tarski's concept of logical consequence is close to Bolzano's\nlogical deducibility. Tarski's first formulation in terms of\nsubstitution is even simply a paraphrase of Bolzano's\ndefinition. Tarski speaks about the replacement of all non-logical\nconstants by any other constants in the sentences of the class\n\\(\\mathbf{K}\\) and in the sentence X, the result of these\nreplacements being \\(\\mathbf{K}'\\) and \\(X'\\), and states that\n“the sentence \\(X'\\) must be true provided only that all\nsentences of the class \\(\\mathbf{K}'\\) are true” (Tarski\n1936 [1983]: 415). This preliminary formulation must, however, be\nabandoned, if “the language we are dealing with does not\nposses a sufficient stock of extra-logical constants”\n(ibid.). Bolzano escapes this objection, because his\nlogic deals with ideas in themselves and not with linguistic\nexpressions, and because he assumes that for every object there is\nan idea that represents it (the difficulties involved with this\nassumption were discussed in detail by Simons (1987: 42) and Siebel\n(1996: 216–223); briefly, the\nprice for this hypothesis seems too high for a contemporary\nlogician). Tarski, who did not make Bolzano's assumption with\nrespect to languages, stated his definitive formulation in terms\nof models, or the satisfaction of sentential functions by\nsequences of objects. There are three main differences between Bolzano's and Tarski's\nconcepts. Marc Siebel tried to show that “the resemblances between\nBolzanian deducibility and Tarski's logical consequence are quite\nlimited (sehr gering)” (1996: 185–223),\nconsidering the distance that separates Bolzano's and Tarski's\nconcepts. I agree with Siebel that it is a question of appraisal\n(eine Ermessungsfrage). If we take into account not the\ninitial Bolzanian concept of deducibility relative to given variable\nideas, but logical derivability, and either adapt or cancel the\nrequirement of consistency of the premises, the distance seems rather\nshort. For me, the main reasons for thinking the two conceptions to be\nquite similar are the facts that in all logical literature between\nBolzano and Tarski (with the possible exception of Carnap), we cannot\nfind anything else so close to Tarski, and that many of Bolzano's\ntheorems about deducibility may be easily translated into Tarski's\nidiom and remain true. Bolzano tried to refine the concept of deducibility by adapting it\nto the then-current inferential practices in science. The result is\nthe concept of exact or strict, adequate,\nirredundant deducibility (genaue, genau bemessene\nAbleitbarkeit) or deducibility in the narrower sense, where there\nare no idle elements. The proposition M is exactly\ndeducible from the premises A, B, C,\n… if M is deducible from those premises and\n“when the same does not hold for any part of the [set of]\npropositions A, B, C, …” and\n(Bolzano 2004a: 54) “we cannot leave out a single constituent of\nthe first two propositions, let alone an entire\nproposition”. (TS II: §155.26, 2, 123; Bolzano\n1973: 213). Bolzano proves that the premises of an exact inference are\nindependent and one can prove that in cases of exact deducibility, the\npremises and the conclusion must share at least one variable (see\nGeorge 1983). A deduction which is not exact is\ncalled redundant (überfüllt). In exact\ndeducibility the conclusion cannot be deduced from any proper subset\nof the premises. The syllogism Barbara (i.e., All A\nare B, All B are C, so All A\nare C) is an exact deduction, while the deduction of\n“Some B are A” from the same two\npremises is redundant. Exact deducibility requires that all\nthe premises and all the ideas contained in them are\nnecessary to draw the conclusion; this condition is the translation\ninto logical terms of the condition of analytic proofs. Propositions\nof degree 0 or 1 (e.g., universally invalid or universally valid\npropositions) are excluded both from the premises and the\nconclusion. Bolzano's exact deducibility thus anticipates the logic of\nrelevance of Anderson and Belnap (1975) in certain respects. is valid, then so is: One of the main reasons why Bolzano's notion of deducibility\npresupposes the compatibility of the premises is that it renders\npossible the extension of deductive logic to inductive logic via\nprobability.  He defines the conditional probability (or\nrelative validity) of a proposition M(i)\nwith respect to a class of premises or\nhypotheses A(i) and\nvariables i, as the ratio of the number of cases in\nwhich all the propositions of the class as well\nas M(i) are true to the number of cases in\nwhich only the propositions A(i) are\nall true. In other words, it is the ratio of the number of true\nvariants of A(i)\nand M(i) to the number of true variants\nof A(i). (As with the concept of\ndegree of validity, Bolzano's definition applies only if the number of\nvariants is finite.) As a consequence, the probability\nof M(i) relative\nto A(i) is a fraction in the closed\ninterval [0,1]. Bolzano's conditional probability is objective, an\nsich. In probability inferences, only one idea from each\ncollection of equivalent (coextensive) ideas is admitted for\nsubstitutions, because if for each variable idea we admit ideas\nequivalent to it, “the totality of the true as well as false\npropositions which can be generated from a given proposition will be\ninfinitely large” (TS II: §147, 79; Bolzano 1973:\n189), and the probability relation might not be well determined. One can immediately see why the premises of a probable deduction\nmust be compatible: the probability of M(i)\nis defined only if the denominator of the fraction is not zero, which\nmeans that the premises A(i) are\ncompatible. On the other hand, the number of ideas that make\nboth A(i)\nand M(i) true cannot be greater than the\nnumber of ideas that make true M(i); as a\nconsequence, the conditional probability\nof M(i) cannot be greater than 1. It is 1\nexactly when the number of ideas that make true\nboth A(i)\nand M(i) is equal to the number of ideas\nthat make true A(i) alone, which\nmeans that all substitutions of ideas that make\ntrue A(i) also make\ntrue M(i), i.e.,\nif M(i) is deducible\nfrom A(i). In other words,\nif M(i) is deducible\nfrom A(i), its probability relative\nto A(i) is equal to 1, which means\nthat the probability equals certainty. The probability is zero if no\nideas make both A(i)\nand M(i) true, i.e.,\nif A(i)\nand M(i) are incompatible. Incompatibility\nand certainty are thus two extreme cases of probability with values of\n0 and 1. This is an extraordinary achievement. Bolzano's approach yields the\nfirst logical definition of probability. For the first time deductive\nlogic and inductive logic are united in a global theory and the former\nappears as a limit case of the latter. It is possible that in\nhis Tractatus 5.15, Wittgenstein took over Bolzano's\ntreatment of probability, perhaps through the mediation of the 1st\nedition of the Philosophical Propedeutic of R. Zimmermann\n(1853). Carnap's regular confirmation functions, too, are strongly\nreminiscent of Bolzano's approach. Bolzano adds proofs of some standard theorems, and also defines\nsubjective probability and different important probabilistic notions\nsuch as the degree of confidence, the credibility of a witness, etc.\nHe gives the formula of the degree of credibility of an event reported\nby independent testimonies as a function of the number of witnesses,\nof the number of testimonies, and of the number of true and false\npropositions stated by each witness. All these concepts play an\nimportant role in the chapter “on the nature of historical\nknowledge, particularly concerning miracles” in Bolzano\n1834. The idea of a reform of logic already appeared in 1810 under the\nheading “objective connection among truths” in\nthe Contributions. Developed in the TS, it\nrepresents the last stage of the development of formal logic in\nBolzano and at the same time the first modern study of axiomatic\nsystems. Although the logical relations studied in the previous\nsections of the TS include relations among collections of\ntruths, they do not take into account the relationship\nof Abfolge (explained below), which is necessary to transform\na simple collection of truths into a theory. Bolzano's idea of an objective order among truths has its origin in\nthe Aristotelian distinction between proofs of the fact and\nthose that yield the reason of the fact. Bolzano's problem is\nthat of providing precise criteria for distinguishing the two types of\nproofs. Proofs of facts, which Bolzano considers to be simple\nsubjective proofs or certifications, may, if correct, be used in\nscience, but they are not explanatory, for they do not capture the\nobjective connections among truths. The goal of a science is to order\nits theorems according their relations of objective dependence, to\nground such theorems objectively in previous theorems and eventually\nin axioms. Objective proofs are assumed to be explanatory and Bolzano\ncalls them grounding proofs [Begründungen]. Are indirect proofs (apagogical, proofs by reduction to\nabsurdity) explanatory? Bolzano definitely preferred direct proofs,\nbecause in indirect proofs the “false conclusion could never\nhave been produced if all the premises from which we derive it were\ntrue” (Bolzano 2004a: 78). Hafner (1999: 387) showed that\nBolzano's objections to indirect proofs were not related to the\ncompatibility requirement or the concept of deducibility, but only to\nthe concept of grounding, which requires true premises.  At several places both in\nthe Wissenschaftslehre and in the Einleitung zur\nGrössenlehre [= On the Mathematical Method, Bolzano\n2004] Bolzano urges that—whenever possible—we put\nforward grounding proofs and don't contend ourselves with\nproofs yielding merely certainty. In other words, he demands that we\nalways aim at proofs that represent a genuine Abfolge\nrelation between propositions (Hafner 1999: 392). According to Hafner, Bolzano prefers direct proofs for two reasons:\n(1) indirect proofs proceed by a detour [Umweg] and contain\nredundant premises, (2) indirect proofs always contain a false premise\nwhich cannot be admitted as the ground of other truths. Bolzano thinks\nthat indirect proofs can be transformed into direct proofs through the\nsimplification of the false propositions contained in\nthem. Nevertheless, for pragmatic reasons, namely the simplicity of\nexpression, in his Theory of Magnitudes\n[Grössenlehre, see bibliography], he also sometimes\naccepts “here and there” indirect proofs as (approximate)\ngroundings. Bolzano calls the ground-consequence relation Abfolge\n(translated as “consequence” or “entailment”,\nmore recently as grounding; I shall take grounding\nrelation and ground-consequence [Grund und\nFolge] relation as synonyms: Abfolge\n= Grund und Folge Verhältnis). It must not be confused\nwith the purely logical relation of deducibility. It has no exact\nequivalent in our logic because it is a “material”\nrelation in the sense that it depends on the “particular\ncharacter of ideas” that occur in it (TS II: §200,\n348). The notion of grounding is central to Bolzano's theory; however,\nBolzano acknowledges that his analysis of grounding is incomplete and\ntentative, merely a first attempt to circumscribe the new\nconcept. “Almost everything I advance in this part is tinged\nwith uncertainty, on many topics I have not reached any decision, and\nat best my inquiries are only fragments and suggestions which will\nhave attained their goal if they provide others with the stimulus to\nreflect further on these matters” (TS II: §195,\n327–8). For a recent exhaustive analysis of the notion\nof grounding, see Roski 2014, one of the best pieces of\nBolzano literature. According to Bolzano, the ground-consequence relation\nholds only between truths, not between propositions in general. He has\nno definite answer as to whether the relation is simple or\ndefinable. He tries to characterize it implicitly by its properties\nexpressed in a series of theorems. In order to obtain a general\nconcept valid for all disciplines, he takes examples from various\nsciences: metaphysics, morals, physics, mathematics, and\nlogic. Despite his initial conjecture that the ground-consequence\nrelation might be simple and thus undefinable, at the end of his\ninvestigation, he conjectures that grounding might well be a formal\nrelation definable in terms of deducibility in an axiomatic\nsystem. The grounding relation holds between a set of truths and their\nimmediate consequences. “There is only one [grounding] for each\ntruth, because the objective ground can only be a single ground”\n(TS IV: §528, 266). If a truth is the consequence of\nseveral truths, they constitute its total ground while each true\npremise is a partial ground. Bolzano begins by comparing the grounding relation to deducibility\nand causality. Contrary to grounding, deducibility can hold also\nbetween false propositions. It can be reciprocal (equivalence) and it\nis transitive and reflexive for propositions of degree of validity\n\\(\\not= 0\\). Moreover, deducibility presupposes the notions of\nsentential form and of variable. On the other hand, grounding is\nneither reflexive nor transitive; it is anti-symmetrical and (in some\ncases at least) connects truths independently of all variation. The\ntwo relations are compatible, however: the same proposition may be at\nthe same time deduced from and grounded in its premise. Hence there\nare two kinds of grounding: formal grounding that is at the\nsame time deducibility and material grounding that holds\nwithout deducibility. Mechanics, particularly the theorem of the composition of forces\n(see Bolzano 1842), yields a causal model of grounding. It is\ncausality that confers the particular character on the grounding\nrelation but eventually, causality is absorbed by it. Finally, for\nBolzano, the proposition “A is the cause\nof B” means that the proposition “A\nexists” contains the ground of the proposition “B\nexists”. As causality holds only between actual things, it is\nreduced to propositions about the grounding relation between real\nobjects. Let us take an example. The propositions “it is warmer in\nsummer than in winter” and “the thermometer stands higher\nin summer than in winter” are equivalent (one is deducible from\nthe other) relative to the variables “summer” and\n“winter”, but “only the latter can be considered as\na consequence of the former”\n(TS II:\n§162, 192; Bolzano 1973: 256). The different examples Bolzano considers show the difficulty if not\nthe impossibility of constructing a general concept of grounding which\nis valid for all disciplines. The situation is different in purely\nconceptual sciences. If we take the following example: we have a grounding relation, because the premises are simpler than\nthe conclusion. Bolzano invokes the same argument against Euclid's\nparallel postulate, which is a proposition too complex to merit the\ntitle of axiom or ground and should be replaced by the principle of\nsimilarity. The Socrates example relates to the simple/complex\nopposition, but in general, simplicity is not a sufficient condition\nof the ground. According to the Contributions, all axioms\nhave simple subject- and predicate-concepts, although, conversely, a\nproposition containing only simple concepts is not necessarily an\naxiom; no such criterion is present in the TS (perhaps he\nknew better by then). Thence, simplicity would be the primary but not\nexclusive principle ordering axiomatic theories. The binomial theorem\n\\((1 + x)^n\\) with an imaginary or real exponent is more general than\nwith a positive integral exponent, but the former is considerably more\ncomplex and cannot be considered an objective ground of the latter\nwhich should be demonstrated first. In other examples taken from\ngeometry the general theorem has priority.  In his Purely\nanalytical proof (1817), too, Bolzano proves first the general\ntheorem for two continuous functions (Bolzano 2004b: §15, 274)\nand only in §18 (p. 276–7) for one continuous function. In\nthese cases, Bolzano puts forward the argument of the greater\ngenerality of the grounds relative to their consequences, even though\nthe consequences are simpler. The grounding relation in the purely conceptual sciences has the\nfollowing properties: Bolzano distinguishes between principles of a\nscience, Grundsätze, which may be demonstrated in\nanother science, and basic truths, Grundwahrheiten,\nwhich have no ground and are true axioms. With Bolzano, the status of\naxioms changes: instead of being evident, objects of intuition, they\nbecome the starting points of proofs in a deductive theory. Sometimes\neven the evidence of theorems is superior to that of axioms, but even\nevident theorems need a proof. The role of proofs, too, is\ntransformed: they have not only to provide subjective certainty, but\nabove all to integrate the theorems into the whole conceptual system.\nThe crucial elements of science are proofs exhibiting the objective\nconnection among truths. In the TS we also witness the\nappearance, for the first time in the history of logic, of proof\ntrees, i.e., diagrams showing the dependence of theorems on their\ngrounds, axioms and auxiliary truths.  For Bolzano, a grounding agument should also be explanatory. So it\nis, if it contains the most general premises from which the\nconclusion is deducible (each of these premises may be less general\nthan the conclusion, though). (Roski 2014: 370) Roski's maint point is to analyse the principles of formal\ngrounding, i.e., the relations between grounding and deducibility. He\nprefers to read them as partial answers to the question under what\nconditions a deductive argument is explanatory […] On what I\ntook to be the most charitable reading of them, Bolzano's principles\nessentially boil down to the claim that a logically valid argument is\nexplanatory, only if there is no argument with fewer\npremises, for none of the premises there is a logically equivalent\nproposition that is simpler, and none of the premises is more complexe\nthan the conclusion.[…] These principles, I have maintained,\ncan be considered to be an explication of the idea that every premise\nand every concept in an explanatory argument is deductively\nrelevant. More importantly, they can be considered to be an\nexplication of the idea that explanation ought to go in hand with some\nkind of theoretical economy. (ibid.) Indeed, at the end of his enquiry, Bolzano considers a set of\npropositions that may be both demonstrated from and grounded in given\naxioms. He thinks that from the point of view of pure deduction, not\ntaking grounding into account, there are several possible partitions\nof such a set into theorems and initial hypotheses. Is not one of\nthese partitions privileged by the grounding relation? It results from the condition of simplicity that the number of propositions which we must accept\noutright (i.e., without deduction from others) will be the smallest if\nwe arrange the propositions according to their objective\nconnection. (TS II: §221, 386; Bolzano 1973: 260) In other words, the ratio between the theorems\nand the hypotheses is the greatest when we separate them according to\nthe objective connection among truths. Pursuing this line of thought, Bolzano finally arrives at a\npossible definition of the grounding relation in terms of the whole\naxiomatic system: I occasionally doubt whether the concept of\nground and consequence, which I have above claimed to be simple, is\nnot complex after all; it may turn out to be none other than the\nconcept of an ordering of truths which allows us to deduce from the\nsmallest number of simple premises the largest possible number of the\nremaining truths as conclusions. (TS II: §221, 388 note;\nBolzano 1973: 292) Some conclusions may be drawn from this passage (even if Bolzano\ndid not draw them). The notion of a basic truth would have to be\ntransformed: a basic truth would now be one that belongs to a minimal\nset of hypotheses which allows the most efficient deduction of all the\nother truths of the system. At the same time, instead of being a\nparticular relation between the ground and its consequence, the\nconcept of grounding in deductive sciences should become a property of\nthe whole system of propositions. Grounding, being no more a simple\nconcept and defined in terms of deducibility by the optimal partition\nbetween axioms and theorems, becomes a global property of a deductive\ntheory. Mancosu (1999: 452) pointed out the difficulties of Bolzano's\nconjectural definition. In particular, Bolzano's geometrical examples\n“fail to provide sufficient intuitive evidence for\ndistinguishing grounds from consequences” (ibid.). On\nthe other hand, the holistic model of the optimal partition provides\nsimply “an arbitrary axiomatic system with the extra condition\nof optimality” (ibid.), which, he argues, is irrelevant\nfor the difference between explanatory and non-explanatory\nproofs. Nevertheless, “Bolzano had the great merit of singling\nout the problem of mathematical explanation as central to the\nphilosophy of mathematics” even if “his attempted\nsolution(s) do not satisfactorily answer the issues he cleverly\nraised” (ibid.). The theory of inferences, the part IV of the Theory of Elements, is\nthe parent pauvre of research on Bolzano. Only three\nimportant studies treat the subject: Fedorov 1980 (Russian), who\noffers five formal systems of the Schlusslehre, Berg 1988 and\nBerka 1992. Even if Bolzano's theory does not bring piercing\ninnovations, it contains nevertheless a systematic presentation of the\nmost general rules of inference. Though Bolzano lets the reader skip\nthis entire part because of its dryness, some passages belong to the\nbest of what Bolzano has written. Thus when he writes about the\ndifference between deducibility in the wide sense, where some\nnon logical ideas do not vary, and logical deducibility,\nwhere all non logical ideas are submitted to variation, he\nexplains it in the following way: In the first case, from the proposition “This is a\ntriangle” we may deduce the following proposition “This is\na figure the sum of whose angles equals two right angles” (with\nrespect to the idea “this”), and from the proposition\n“Caius is a man”, we can deduce the proposition\n“Caius has an immortal soul” (with respect to the idea\n“Caius”). For whenever we replace the indicated idea by\nsome other idea, the conclusions become true whenever the premises are\ntrue. But to realise this, we must know two truths, namely that the\nsum of the angles in any triangle equals two right angles, and that\nthe souls of all men are immortal. Since these are truths which are\nnot at all concerned with logical matters, i.e., with the nature of\nconcepts and propositions, or rules according to which we must proceed\nin scientific exposition, nobody will demand that logic should teach\ndeductions of that sort. Hence, what can be expected in this place is\nonly the description of those modes of deduction whose correctness can\nbe shown from logical concepts alone or, what comes to the same thing,\nwhich can be expressed in the form of truths, in which nothing is\nmentioned except concepts, propositions and other logical objects. So the inference about Caius needs a second\n premise saying that all men have immortal souls, and two new variable\n ideas: “man” and “soul”. To see the correctness of this deduction nothing\nis required save the knowledge of the general truth that from two\npropositions of the form “A is B” and “B is C”\na third proposition of the form “A is C” is deducible. But\nwe can see this without knowing anything at all about the nature of\nman, of death, etc. (TS II: §223, 392.) The concept of exact (adequate) inference finds its application in\nBolzano's deductive system: “[i]t would be misguided and\nexcessive to consider anything here but exact\ninferences” (TS II: §223, 393).\n\nUnder the condition of the greatest possible simplicity of the\npremises and the conclusion, all forms of inference of\nthe Schlusslehre are formale Abfolgen, i.e. grounded\ninferences. In short, the Theory of inferences (altogether 123 pages)\ncontains only logical, exact and grounded\ninferences. \n As from any proposition one may infer an infinity of them, the system\n contains only general rules of inference, not between the\n propositions themselves, but between their forms. Bolzano defines\n inference not as a conclusion or an act, but as a statement of\n deduction, so that behind all inference is the relation of\n deducibility. When he treats extensional relations among propositions\n (compatibility, deducibility, etc.), he never considers the internal\n structure of propositions while he does it systematically in his\n theory of inference. For easier reading, I shall use the standard\n notation A is B instead of the Bolzanese expressions A\n has (the property) b or  Whatever has (the property) a has\n (the property) b; Bolzano himself does it in several\n sections. Let us also remind that such universal categorical\n propositions have existential import and that a subject-idea of a\n true proposition must be objectual. Whole propositions may be subject\n to variation, too. Contrary to Aristotle, he admits also objectless\n ideas (e.g., the idea blue virtue or the idea x such\n that \\(x\\not =x\\)) and ideas having the greatest extension\n (e.g., the idea something or the idea x such that\n \\(x=x\\)). Sometimes Bolzano uses metalanguage in\n prefixing false in front of a proposition where we would\n simply put a negation.  The condition of objectuality of ideas raises sometimes a\nproblem. As Bolzano does not take into account all possibilities of\nthe logical square (he does not exploit all its diagonals), Fedorov\n(1980: 120) deems that its limitations suggest the idea of the syllogistic without the law of\nexcluded middle.[…] For example, we discover that in Bolzano's\nlogic, the judgments of the form SeP cannot be simply\nconverted. If we take No P is S, i.e., all P is not-S and\nsubstitute round square for P, and the name of any\ngeometrical object (e.g of a cube), we obtain All round squares\nare non-cubes and, taking into account the existential import of\nuniversal propositions, there are round squares which are\nnon-cubes, so that there are round squares.  For Berka (1992: 142), Bolzano’s theory of inference represents a relevant contribution to natural\ndeduction, […] although he used it only intuitively. As an\nintroduction to his theory, Bolzano begins with three general rules\n“on how conclusions to given premises can be found”\n(TS II: §224, 395–396):  The rules of inference are divided into 13 sections arranged\naccording to growing complexity. Section I begins with inferences from\none premise, which can be A is B or No A is B. From\nthe former, one can obtain following conclusions: A is\nnot-not-B; if every A is B, then A not-B is\nobjectless; ext B is not contained in ext A, so\nthat B is higher or equivalent to A; contraposition\nunder the condition that the extension of B is neither\nuniversal nor empty, and other. From the latter, e.g., The\nproposition that some A are B is false. Other inferences are obtained from the combination of several\npremises of the previous forms, e.g., the deduction theorem quoted in\nthe section 6.6, and the following:  In §227 Bolzano treats nine Aristotelian modes of syllogism;\nten additional modes are treated in §235. Bolzano has less modes,\nbecause in Bolzanese several different forms of inferences merge.  In section II Bolzano works with the negations of the previous\nforms I (inferences modo tollente). An example: from\n(A is B) is false, one may obtain that A is\nempty or that A not-B has objectuality (is not\nempty). Section III treats inferences from the objectuality of an idea\nor from its denial, e.g., the inferences from \\(\\exists xAx\\) to\n\\(\\neg\\forall x\\neg Ax\\), and from \\(\\neg\\exists xAx\\) to \\(\\forall\nx\\neg Ax\\). If we combine the proposition: the idea X which is\nnot-A + not-B + … has no objectuality, with\nseveral propositions of the forms: A is M, B is M, … or instead\nwith the more restricted propositions XA is M, XB is\nM, …, we obtain the conclusion Every X is\nM.  Other sections deal with singular ideas (section IV,\nexample: if A is a singular idea, not-A has an infinity of objects; in\nthis section, Bolzano also combines inferences from all forms)\nand general ideas. Important is the section VI which\ncontains, under the heading Determination of the width of an\nidea, the determination of numbers. Such is the\ninference which from The totality of A is = n and A is\nB concludes to The totality of B is certainly no less than\nn. Section VII has as premises extensional relations\nbetween ideas, e.g., from A is included in B, we\nconclude to the equivalence of this premise with A is B. The\nfollowing sections treat extensional relations\nbetween propositions (compatibility, deducibility, etc.) and\nthe last one, XIII (§253), the relation\nof probability. Here one finds the following important\ntheorem:  If the probability of the proposition M\nrelative to the assumptions A, B, C,\n… and with respect to the variables i, j,\n… is equal to m, then the probability\nof not-M relative to the same assumptions and the same\nvariables is equal to 1−m.  In the same paragraph 253, which concludes the exposition of\nBolzano's logic, the author states the inference of incomplete\ninduction which contains two premises; 1) A propery which\nbelongs to all A that has so far been observed probably belongs to all\nA in general and adds that “The probability depends in part\non the absolute number of observed A, in part on the proportion\nbetween observed A and all A” (TS II: §253,\n511). 2) The second premise states that b is such an\nattribute; in the conclusion that attribute b is assigned\nto A with a certain degree of probability.  Special cases of incomplete induction are arguments\nfrom analogy or similarity, where the premises\nare: The major: “We surmise with a greater or lesser\ndegree of probability that an attribute which we have always or almost\nalways found whenever we found the\nattributes a, b, c, … united shall\nalso be found in every object where the\nattributes a, b, c, … are all\npresent (where the probabillity increases with the number of mutually\nindependent attributes a, b, c, …,\nand also with the number of times this attribute has been present\nwhere the others were, and with the probability on other grounds that\nthis attribute is a consequence of a, b, c,\n…, etc.” (ibid.), The minor: x is is an attribute and M an object,\nas described in the major, and the conclusion is: x belongs probably\nto M.  We have an example with the famous inference by means of which we\nappeal to the many attributes the earth has in common with other\nheavenly bodies and the fact that the earth is inhabited to infer that\nthe others are as well (ibid., 513). Are inductive inferences just empirical generalisations? Bolzano\nreplies that, contrary to the opinion of important logicians (and\ncontrary to Husserl's criticism (1939, p. 326) directed against Bolzano's alleged\n“empiricism”), the validity of these two rules does not\ndepend on experience, but that they are absolutely valid, purely conceptual truths, just like\nthe rules of inference for ordinary syllogisms or subalternation. We\ndo not have to consult experience to find out if these rules hold;\nrather, we must presuppose their validity to learn from experience in\nthe first place(ibid.).  Bolzano's TS is a turning point not only in logic, but\nalso in epistemology. The author examines human knowledge in its most\naccomplished forms, realised in scientific knowledge. According to\nCavaillès (2008: 35), for the first time perhaps, science is not\n considered as only mediating between the human mind and the being in\n itself, dependent on both and having no proper reality, but as an\n object sui generis, original in its essence, autonomous in\n its movement. Science is defined by its structure “which\n not only is demonstration, but which merges together with\n demonstration” (ibid., 39). Stressing the fundamental\n role of demonstrations in scientific knowledge, Bolzano presented a\n viable alternative to Kant's philosophy of mathematics based on\n constructions in pure intuition. A truly scientific proof should ground\nthe theorem, i.e., to integrate it into a scientific theory organised\naccording to the “objective connection of truths”,\nstarting with axioms and fundamental concepts.[…]. These ideas\nindicate the direction of future research: the notion of normal proof\nin the sense of Gentzen, the proof trees, König lemma (Šebestik\n1992: 478).  Mathematicians were the first to respond to Bolzano's\nappeal. While at least some of Bolzano's mathematical works drew the\nattention the greatest German mathematicians (Weierstrass, Cantor, and\nDedekind), until the end of the XIXth century his logic met for the\nmost part with indifference and incomprehension. In mathematics,\nBolzano proved some of the fundamental theorems of analysis, sketched\nthe first theory of real numbers, produced an extraordinary theory of\nreal functions, introduced the concept of set and that of the actual\ninfinite, and stated the characteristic condition of infinite\nsets. Even his friend Exner, who had had the benefit of additional\ndetailed explanations, was unable to understand his reform of logic.\nHe was not happy with the TS because of Bolzano's concepts of\nproposition and intuition in itself and of his criticisms of\nHerbart. Bolzano's treatment of logic was so radically new that only\nat the end of the 19th century, did philosophers of the\nBrentano school begin to understand some of its parts, starting with\nKerry, Twardowski, Meinong and Husserl. Some of the most important\nlogical ideas of Bolzano spread among Austrian secondary school\nstudents through the first edition of Zimmermann's textbook (1853),\nwhich contained a summary of Bolzano's logic. Being accused of\nplagiarism, Zimmermann omitted these passages from Bolzano in the\nsecond edition.  Wittgenstein might have taken inspiration from them\nin writing his Tractatus. Russell knew the Paradoxes of\nthe infinite and some of his thoughts on logic are parallel to\nBolzano's. Curiously, Frege, whose ideas were often so close to those\nof Bolzano and who in his time was the only logician capable of\nunderstanding him, never mentioned him. He was confronted with\nBolzano's ideas three times: in one of Kerry's articles, in the\ncorrespondence with Husserl, and later in the controversy with Korselt\n(see Sundholm 2000); he never reacted to their allusions.  It is quite\npossible that he never laid hands on any of Bolzano's works (see\nKreiser 1981), apart, perhaps, from the Paradoxes of the\ninfinite.  (In §530 of TS, Bolzano presents a\ntheorem to the effect that every indirect proof can be transformed\ninto a direct proof.  Mancosu (1996, 110-117 and note 69, p. 234)\npoints out the striking similarity of this claim with a claim to the\nsame effect presented by Frege in one of his posthumous writings\n(“Logic in Mathematics”). In addition, Bolzano and Frege\nused the very same example to exemplify their claims, Euclid I.19.)\n\n \nAfter Twardowski (1894), it was chiefly Husserl who drew philosophers'\nattention to Bolzano with his memorable words about TS (1970,\nI: 222), a work which, in its treatment of the logical 'theory\nof elements', far surpasses everything that the world-literature has\nto offer in the way of a systematic sketch of logic.  Bolzano did not,\nof course, expressedly discuss or support any independent demarcation\nof pure logic in our sense, but he provided one de facto in\nthe first two volumes of his work, in his discussion of what underlay a\nWissenschaftslehre or theory of science in the sense of his\nconception; he did so with such purity and scientific strictness, and\nwith such a rich store of original, scientifically confirmed and ever\nfruitful thoughts, that we must count him as one of the greatest\nlogicians of all time. Neveretheless, he always insisted on the originality of his own\nphenomenological method.  Between the two wars, Bolzano's logic and\nphilosophy of mathematics inspired Heinrich Scholz and Jean\nCavaillès. At the same time Tarski discovered the concept of\nlogical consequence independently of Bolzano, but Tarski discovered\nthe affinity between his work and Bolzano's only after Scholz pointed\nit out to him. However, already in Twardowski (1894), the founder of\nthe Polish Lvov-Warsaw school, Bolzano's ideas are discussed and\ncriticized at length, and some of them might have become the common\nground of the Polish school (some of Bolzano's expressions are found\nliterally in Tarski). In 1920, Hans Hahn edited the Paradoxes of\nthe infinite with important critical notes, comparing Bolzano\nwith Cantor. Karl Menger might have taken inspiration for his theory\nof dimension not only from Poincaré, but also from the\nParadoxes. Neurath praised Bolzano as one of the ancestors of\nthe Vienna Circle, because of the conciseness of his style and the\nrejection of Kant's philosophy. Some important Bolzanian ideas are\nalso found in the work of Quine. All these currents are indebted to\nBolzano for the lesson of intellectual rigor and of analytic power. It\nis Bolzano who is the true founder of the kind of analytical\nphilosophy whose core is logic and which is impregnated with\nscience. His logic has archaic aspects, but he introduced not only new\nconcepts, methods and theories, new themes and new problems, but above\nall a new spirit that has pervaded philosophy ever since.","contact.mail":"sebestik@flu.cas.cz","contact.domain":"flu.cas.cz"}]
