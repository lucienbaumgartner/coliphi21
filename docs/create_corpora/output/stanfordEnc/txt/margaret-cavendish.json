One is that it lays out\nan early and very compelling version of the naturalism that is found\nin current-day philosophy and science. It also offers important\ninsights that bear on recent discussions of the nature and\ncharacteristics of intelligence and the question of whether or not the\nbodies that surround us are intelligent or have an intelligent cause.\nAnother reason that the work of Cavendish is important is that it\nanticipates some of the central views and arguments that are more\ncommonly associated with figures like Thomas Hobbes and David Hume.\nShe also offers novel and compelling responses to questions that are\ncentral to the discussions of the Seventeenth Century – for example,\nabout whether sense perception is by means of impressions; about\nwhether human beings are free in a libertarian or a compatibilist\nsense; about whether whether there is any true disorder in the natural\nworld; about the limits of knowledge, and the limits of ideas and\nlanguage; and about how motion is transferred between bodies. In\naddition, she takes on important debates in social and political\nphilosophy, with a focus on issues of agency and authority, and in\nparticular on the relation between an individual's desire to live a\nlife with which they identify and the receptivity and accommodation\nthat that desire encounters in the world outside the mind. Finally,\nshe anticipates discussions in the work of contemporary philosophers\nabout whether or not our ability to understand how matter thinks is\nrelevant to the question of whether it does think. \n\nMargaret Lucas was born in 1623 in Colchester, Essex. She did not\nreceive a formal education in disciplines such as mathematics,\nhistory, philosophy, and the classical languages, but she had access\nto scholarly libraries and was an avid reader. She began to put her\nown ideas to paper at a very early age, and although it was regarded\nas unseemly at the time for a woman to be publicly intellectual, she\nwas able to be an intellectual in private in regular conversations\nwith her middle-brother John. This is noteworthy because John was\nalready a well-established scholar: a student of law, philosophy, and\nnatural science, he was fluent in Hebrew, Latin and Greek, and would\neventually become a founding member of the Royal Society (Whitaker\n2002, 11–12). In 1643, seeking a life of independence, Lucas\napplied to be a maid of honor at the court of Queen Henrietta Maria.\nWhen the queen was exiled to France in 1644, Lucas accompanied her and\nshortly thereafter met William Cavendish. They married in 1645, and\nwould remain in exile (in Paris, then Rotterdam, then Antwerp) until\nthe restoration of the crown in 1660 (Battigelli 1998,\n1–10). \nThere are two reasons why it is important to mention the marriage of\nMargaret Lucas and William Cavendish. One is that in the\nmid-seventeenth-century it was unusual for a publisher to print the\nphilosophical and scientific work of a woman. Cavendish was a\nsufficiently brilliant and impressive writer that she was able to\npublish some of her work without assistance (Whitaker 2002, 154),\nincluding her very first work [Poems and Fancies, 1653], but\nsome of her writings were published with the help of her\nwell-connected husband. The second reason why it is important to\nmention the marriage of Lucas to Cavendish is that through the\n“Cavendish Circle” meetings that he organized in the\n1640s, she interacted with such figures as Thomas Hobbes, Rene\nDescartes, Marin Mersenne, Pierre Gassendi, and Kenelm Digby (Hutton\n1997a, 422–3; Whitaker 2002, 92–4; Clucas 1994,\n256–64). But these philosophers would not engage with her\ndirectly. Unfortunately and sadly for her and for us, she had no\nwritten philosophical correspondence with any of these philosophers.\nWhen they would not critically correspond with her in print, she\nengaged their views critically in the form of a correspondence between\nherself and a fictional third\n person.[1] \nCavendish lived and wrote in the thick of the mechanistic revolution\nof the seventeenth century, though many of her views—about\nthinking matter, the transfer of motion, and the nature of scientific\nexplanation—are largely anti-mechanistic, and in many respects\nher arguments ran against the grain. In her own age, she was regarded\nalternately as mad, pretentious, a curiosity, and a genius. She\nfinally received some much-wanted recognition from her male peers in\n1667, when she was offered an extremely rare invitation to participate\nin a meeting of the Royal Society, though to be sure she was regarded\nas a spectacle by many in attendance (Whitaker 2002, 291–306).\nShe died in December 1673 and was buried at Westminster Abbey. Over\nthe course of her short life she produced a number of important works\nin philosophy. These include Worlds Olio (1655),\nPhilosophical and Physical Opinions (1656), Philosophical\nLetters (1664), Observations Upon Experimental\nPhilosophy (1666), The Description of a New World, Called the\nBlazing World (1666), and Grounds of Natural Philosophy\n(1668). \nThe central tenet of Cavendish's philosophy is that everything in the\nuniverse—including human beings and their minds—is\ncompletely material. Her commitment to this tenet is reflected\nthroughout her corpus: \nAccording to Cavendish, none of the achievements of bodies are to be\ntraced to immaterial agents such as God, immaterial finite minds, or\nsubstantial forms, because bodies have the resources to bring about\neverything that they do on their own. Cavendish also holds that bodies\nare ubiquitous and that there is no vacuum, because extensions of\nspace cannot be extensions of nothing but must be extensions of\n matter.[3]\n Every body is infinitely divisible (Cavendish 1668a, 125, 263;\nCavendish 1668b, 239), and all of the bodies in nature, at every level\nof division, are intelligent and perceptive (Cavendish 1668a, 16, 156;\nCavendish 1668b, 7). As we will see, one of Cavendish's motivations\nfor accepting the latter view is that it makes sense of the order that\nwe encounter in the natural world. \nCavendish is aware that she is writing in a tradition in which the\nprospect of thinking matter is not going to be taken seriously. In the\neyes of many of her contemporaries and predecessors, matter is not\nonly unintelligent, but also inert and utterly worthless. She\nwrites, \nCavendish does not accept a conception of matter according to which\nmatter is low-grade being. Her view that minds are corporeal is not\nthe view that minds are \nCavendish will argue that the processes that are traditionally\nidentified as material are wondrous and impressive and that the\nprocesses that she would identify as material, but that others would\nidentify as immaterial, are even more so. As we will see, her view on\nthe sophistication of matter also informs other aspects of her\nthinking – for example, her metaphysics of imagination, according to\nwhich imaginings are not static pictures, but living figures that are\ncreative and able to take on a life of their own; and also her view of\nthe superiority of natural productions to human artifacts. According\nto Cavendish, the latter are composed of bodies that are put together\nquickly and do not have the same history of communication and\nsynchronization as the entities that compose a production of nature\n(Cunning 2016, 185-196). When Cavendish says that ideas are material\nimages, or that natural productions are more sophisticated than\nartifacts, she is not supposing a conception of matter according to\nwhich it is static and inert and dead. Her own views employ some of\nthe language of the tradition – for example matter,\nimage, and idea – but she fleshes out her system in\na number of novel directions in part because she uses that language\nvery differently and argues that, traditionally speaking, it has been\nvery much abused. \nCavendish is working within a philosophical tradition in which the\ndoctrine that matter is self-moving and intelligent is almost\ncompletely unintelligible. To those of her opponents who allow that\nthe doctrine can be entertained, it is unlikely at best, and\nif true it is a terrible disappointment. \nFor example, in Plato we find the view that “the philosopher\nfrees the soul from association with the body as much as\npossible” (Plato, 64e-65a). For Plato, souls are invisible and\nintangible and hence indivisible and divine, and bodies are their\ncomplete opposite (78b-80b). We know from an analysis of our concept\nof body, and from our presumably related observation of the sudden\ninactivity of things that die, that animated bodies have a soul and\nthat bodies on their own are inert (105c-e). A soul is obviously what\nactivates and enlivens a body, and the opposite of a soul, its body,\nis “death” (105e). Our embodiment and our resulting\nphysical needs incline us to pursue sensible objects, but these are\nnot worthy of our attention, and they interfere with our ability to\nattend to things that are. \nWe find a similar contempt for the body in prominent philosophers of\nlater ancient philosophy and in medieval and early modern philosophers\nas well. In “On Beauty,” Plotinus speaks to “the\ndarkness inherent in matter” (Plotinus, I.6, 37). He praises the\nsensible, but only to the extent that it imitates immaterial ideas and\nminds: \nFire is still material, of course, and material things are no\nsubstitute for things that are immaterial and (hence) divine (40).\nPlotinus continues, \nIn a word, Plotinus thinks that we should do all that we can to\nmitigate the unfortunate fact of our embodiment and instead engage in\nphilosophical reflection. A hundred years later Augustine repeats the\nsame view exactly: \nFor Augustine, body is so bad that sin consists in turning our\nattention away from eternal things to things that are temporal and\ncorporeal (27). Augustine is working in the Christian tradition, and\nit cannot be ignored that although Christ made a tremendous sacrifice\nin giving up his body, the abandonment of the physical in favor of the\npurely spiritual reads very differently through an Augustinian and\nPlatonic lens. \nThis same manner of thinking finds its way into the seventeenth\ncentury as well. In the Cartesian (and very Augustinian and Platonic)\nphilosopher Nicolas Malebranche, we find the view that bodies are\n“inferior things” that are essentially passive and inert\n(Malebranche 1674–5, VI.ii.3, 447, 448). He brings together the\nwhole spectrum of themes that are advanced by his body-dismissing\npredecessors. In Dialogues on Metaphysics and on Religion,\nhis spokesperson Theodore says to his opponent Aristes that our\nembodiment is a burden and that we should neutralize it to whatever\nextent we can: \nFor Malebranche, the search for truth is very literally a matter of\nretreating to the study, where the possibility is minimized that we\nwill be distracted by the lures of the sensible world. In\nMalebranche's (and Cavendish's) contemporary Ralph Cudworth we find a\nsimilar disgust for the body. Cudworth argues that there is a\nhierarchy of being that applies to creatures and that minds are at the\ntop. Bodies are dead and lowly, and are squarely at the bottom: \nCudworth is certainly aware that the bodies that surround us are\nactive and engage in behaviors that are orderly and (at least\napparently) teleological, but none of this is evidence that matter is\nnot dead. Cudworth concludes that because matter is dead, its\norderly and purposive behavior can only be explained on the assumption\nthat it is accompanied by a (necessarily immaterial) guide (Cunning\n2010). \nThere are other philosophers in the seventeenth century who agree that\nmatter is a detestable sort of being, but conclude that it does not\nexist, or at least that it does not exist as conceived by the\ntradition. In Anne Conway we find the view that God would not, and did\nnot, create it: \nFor Conway, God creates only beings that are alive, and so the\neveryday objects that surround us are something other than what\nPlotinus, Malebranche and Digby had thought. There exists nothing that\nis brute, inert, and unthinking, and instead there is a continuum of\ncreatures that exist on a spectrum from highly intelligent and active\nto largely dim and dull. Cavendish agrees with Conway that nothing\nanswers to the traditional conception of matter, but unlike Conway she\nis happy to say that matter surrounds us. Cavendish and Conway are for\nthe most part in agreement; she [Cavendish] simply rejects the\ntraditional conception of matter as inadequate, and then proceeds to\nargue that the things that our concept of matter has always picked\nout—the things that our language has designated as\n‘material’—are something more. Unlike many of her\nopponents, she is not disappointed by the result that minds are\nmaterial. She thinks on the contrary that it is a source of hope. For\nexample, if we appreciate that minds are corporeal, we will be able to\ncome up with better and more systematic and less groping treatments of\nmental\n illness.[6]\n As evidence for her view, Cavendish points to the obvious facts that\na person's mood and energy are affected by nutrition (Cavendish 1663,\n431–2), and that old age and injury to the brain can neutralize\nsome of our cognitive functions (Cavendish 1668b, 85–6, 113;\nCavendish 1663, 334–5). Cavendish is breaking with her tradition\nand arguing that the fulfillment of a person is not a matter of\nturning away from the body but understanding all of its dynamics and\nembracing\n it.[7] \nAn important strand in Cavendish's argument for materialism is her\ndefense of the view that matter thinks. If she can successfully defend\nthis view, then the fact of the existence of thinking will not be\nevidence against the view that everything is material. One of her\narguments for the doctrine of thinking matter begins with the\nassumption that our minds are housed in our bodies. She assumes that\nwe are being serious when we say that our thinking takes place in the\nhead, and concludes that to the extent to which we are speaking\nliterally our thoughts must have figure and be spatially situated: \nSince “[p]lace [is] an attribute that belongs onely to a\nBody” (Cavendish 1664, 8), minds and their ideas are material. A\nrelated reason that Cavendish offers in favor of the view that\nthinking is material is that \nCavendish takes it to be obvious that ideas are located in the brain,\nand she is thereby committed to the view that when a person travels\nfrom one place to another, the person's mind partakes of motion as\nwell. Cavendish is appealing to the premise that there is no\nimmaterial motion as support her view that minds are material, and she\nis implicitly assuming the premise that when a person travels from one\nplace to another, so do the thoughts that the person has along the\nway. She writes:  \nHere Cavendish is anticipating a line of argumentation that we later\nfind in Locke: \nLocke only hints at the conclusion that minds are material, but\nCavendish by contrast is not concerned to pull any\n punches.[10]\n The thesis that matter thinks is an unrevisable element of her\nphilosophical system. It is not an unwelcome appendage but instead is\na straightforward consequence of tenets that she takes to be\nobvious. \nPulling the two arguments together, modifications like motion and\nlocation pertain only to bodies, and because our minds travel with our\nbodies and are housed in them, they are material. Cavendish is in\neffect trying to corner her opponent into explaining what the sense is\nin which minds move or our housed in our brains if they are not\nmaterial. A figure like Leibniz is comfortable elucidating the nature\nof (immaterial) minds in terms of the language of windows, dizziness,\nponds and spatial perspective (Monadology, sections 7, 21,\n67, 57). Cavendish is insisting that the language of motion and\ndimension applies to bodies alone. \nAnother argument that Cavendish puts forward for the view that\nthinking is material is from mind-body interaction. First, she\npresupposes a standard materialist premise: that nothing can interact\nwith or come into contact with a body but a body. She writes, \nIn fine, I cannot conceive, how a Spirit … can have the effects\nof a body, being none it self; for the effects flow from the cause;\nand as the cause is, so are its effects…. (Cavendish 1664,\n197) \nit is, in my opinion, more probable, that one material should act upon\nanother material, or one immaterial should act upon another\nimmaterial, then that an immaterial should act upon a material or\ncorporeal. (Cavendish 1664, 207) \nThis is a standard kind of argument that we find in philosophers\nranging from Lucretius to Gassendi to Spinoza to Searle: that things\ncannot stand in causal relations with bodies unless they are material\n themselves.[11]\n Cavendish does allow that there are many instances in which bodies\nare at a distance from each other but still stand in causal relations.\nThere are obvious cases like our perception of the sun, which had\nbetter be far away if we are to be in a position to sense it, and also\ncases like a shout of loud noise. But Cavendish holds that in the end\nthese amount to interaction by contact. She writes, \nThis is in fact a fairly controversial view to attribute to Cavendish\n-- that interaction is always by contact. As we will see in more\ndetail later, she subscribes to an occasionalist doctrine of causation\nthat would appear to allow that causation often occurs at a distance.\nFor Cavendish, bodies never transfer motion to other bodies, but\ninstead a body always moves by its own internal motions. More\nspecifically, when the behavior of body A leads to a change in the\nbehavior of body B, B acts by means of motions that it already had. A\nis thus the \"occasional\" cause of the change in the behavior of B; it\ninforms B of the motions that it would like B to undertake, but there\nis no transfer of motion from A to B, because motion is always\ninseparable from the body that has it. In the case of sense\nperception, for example, an external body A does not stamp itself on a\nsense organ B and transfer to it new motions by means of which B forms\nan image of A. Instead, A presents an image of itself to B, and B\nforms a pattern or copy of that image by means of motions that B\nalready had. The internal motions that are continuously present in a\n\"patient\" body B may not always be overtly noticeable – for example,\nthere are the motions of the microscopic bodies that compose a table\nor chair, which itself appears to be wholly at rest – but such\nmotions are continuously present in B, and on the occasion of an\n\"active\" body A, they just take on a new direction. \nNow we return to the controversial interpretive question about whether\nor not Cavendish holds that interaction is always by contact. A reason\nfor thinking that she allows for action at a distance is that she is\ncommitted to saying that, in cases in which we perceive an object that\nis at a distance, the image that is formed via our sense organ is due\nto motions that are entirely its own. However, a reason for thinking\nthat Cavendish holds that strictly speaking there is no action at a\ndistance is that in the above passage she suggests that apparent cases\nof action at a distance in the end always involve \"touch.\" There are\nmany other reasons to suppose that Cavendish does not allow action at\na distance. One is that, as we will see, there are a number of\npassages in which she describes bodies as dominating and subordinating\nbodies that are at a distance, and forcing them to act as they do, and\nit is difficult to understand how these could be cases of domination\nor subordination if the external body was merely presenting a\nrecommendation – or the equivalent of a stern talking-to – from\nafar. In addition, if Cavendish holds that occasional causes are a\nkind of trigger or occasion for the action of any \"patient\" body B,\nthen even if she supposes that motion is never transferred from one\nbody to another, she still needs a way to make sense of how an\noccasional cause A signals or communicates to a body B how it would\nlike B to behave. As we will see, she defends a plenum metaphysic\naccording to which the universe is a continuum of perceptive bodies,\nand so an obvious explanation that she can offer for cases of apparent\naction at a distance is that the universe is a plenum of contiguous\nand communicative bodies, and a given message is often patterned from\none body to the next to the next. \nCavendish subscribes to the view that interaction is always by\ncontact, and she aims to apply the view as well. Our bodies interact\nwith our minds, and so our minds must be material; but anything that\nour minds detect must be material as well. Anything that we know,\nanything that we try to explain, anything that we theorize about,\nanything that we encounter, anything of which we can become\naware—these are all material. Cavendish writes, \nWherefore no part of nature (her parts being corporeal) can perceive\nan immaterial; because it is impossible to have a perception of that\nwhich is not perceptible, as not being an object fit or proper for\ncorporeal\n perception.[12] \n[N]atural reason cannot know nor have naturally any perception or idea\nof an Incorporeal being. (Cavendish 1668a, 78) \nBut as for Immaterial, no mind can conceive that, for it cannot put it\nself into nothing, although it can dilate and rarifie it self to an\nhigher degree, but must stay within the circle of natural\nbodies…. (Cavendish 1664, 69)  \nOur minds are material, but the only things that they can come into\ncontact with and detect are things that are material as well. Even if\nthere happen to be immaterials in our environment, we cannot perceive\nor form ideas of them, and hence the entities that we do\nconceive and discuss are not these immaterials but something else.\nCavendish writes, \nthere may be supernatural spiritual beings or substances in Nature,\nwithout any hinderance to Matter or corporeal Nature. The same I may\nsay of the natural material, and the divine and supernatural Soul; for\nthough the divine Soul is in a natural body, and both their powers and\nactions be different, yet they cause no ruine or disturbance to each\n other….[13] \nNature is a corporeal substance, and without a substance Motion cannot\nbe, and without Motion opposition cannot be made, nor any action in\nNature…. (Cavendish 1664, 242) \nInstead of trying to circumscribe every single existent and then offer\nan account of each in turn, Cavendish assumes the existence of the\nmaterial objects in our local surroundings and argues that because our\nminds detect them, our minds are material, as is everything else that\nwe come to encounter. Immaterial things might exist, Cavendish is\ncertainly conceding, but if so they are nothing to us, and are not\nincluded in the domain of inquiry when we do metaphysics or\nscience. \nSometimes Cavendish comes close to saying something even stronger:\nthat material things are the only things that exist or are real. For\nexample, she writes, \nIf Cavendish holds that the only things that are real are things that\nhave dimension, she is not alone. Her contemporary Thomas Hobbes\nargued along the same lines: \nCavendish does subscribe to the view that only material things are\nreal and\n substantial,[14]\n but she is not thereby committed to the view that the only existents\nare material. She might hold that our word ‘real’ picks\nout things that are tangible and spatial, but that there are other\nexistents as well. Cavendish suggests as much when she says that we\nmight be surrounded by immaterials, but that we cannot detect them.\nShe also emphasizes that when she denies the existence of immaterials,\nshe is merely denying the existence of natural immaterials\n— she is saying that the ideas and minds that we detect and know\nare a part of nature and hence are material. She writes, \nall that is called Immaterial, is a Natural Nothing, and an Immaterial\nNatural Substance, in my opinion, is non-sense…. (Cavendish\n1664, 321) \nCavendish is committed to saying that the ideas and minds that we\nencounter are a part of nature and are material. She is not thereby\ndenying the existence of immaterials simpliciter. She is committed to\nthe view that there are no natural immaterials. \nA problem that arises, however, is that Cavendish also appears to be\ncommitted to saying that human minds cannot perceive or detect\nimmaterials and that we cannot form ideas of them. For example, she\nsays that “when we name God, we name an Unexpressible, and\nIncomprehensible Being” (Cavendish 1664, 315). Cavendish\nsuggests (very strongly) that we can think and speak of immaterials in\nher remark that they might in fact surround us; she says that even if\nthey did, we would be none the wiser. But still the question remains\nabout how Cavendish can allow that we are able to think or talk about\nimmaterials at all, if we are not able to perceive or detect or have\nideas of them. \nThere are a number of ways that Cavendish might maneuver here. One\nwould be to defend the thesis that although our natural (and hence\nmaterial) minds can form no conception of an immaterial, there is\nanother aspect of our minds — an aspect that is not material\n— and it can form conceptions of immaterials. Cavendish\nhints at the thesis when she states that natural reason cannot have an\nidea of an incorporeal being, leaving open that non-natural reason\ncould have an idea of an incorporeal being. A problem of course is\nthat Cavendish does not seem to be able to allow that natural reason\ncan have an idea of non-natural reason or that it can put forward the\nthesis that non-natural reason can form conceptions of\nimmaterials. \nAnother maneuver would be to make a distinction between knowledge and\nfaith and argue that although our minds cannot detect immaterials or\nhave any evidence for their existence, there must be some way in which\nour minds are able to conceive of immaterials (such as God), or else\nwe would not even be capable of faith. Cavendish writes for example\nthat \nthe rational [component of the mind] perceives some effects of the\nomnipotent power of God; which effects are perceptible by finite\ncreatures, but not his infinite nature, nor essence, nor the cause of\nhis infiniteness and omnipotency. (Ibid., 90) \nA problem of course is that if Cavendish is committed to the view that\nnatural reason can form no conception of an immaterial, then she can\nallow that we have ideas of things that are the effect of an\nimmaterial cause, but it is difficult to see how we could have an idea\nof that immaterial cause itself. So long as she \"take[s] and idea to\nbe the picture of some object\" (Cavendish 1668, 74) and so long as\nimmaterials cannot be captured in a figure or image, it would appear\nthat she is committed to saying that we can have no ideas of\nimmaterials at all. \nA third maneuver that Cavendish could make is to say that when she\ntalks in the language of immaterials, she is using terms that she does\nnot take to be referential, but that are still serving an important\ncommunicative role. For example, when she speaks of the immaterial\nsouls that might surround us, and the way in which they would be\nnothing to us, she might be trying to make a point in the language of\nher opponents. They speak in terms of immaterials, and\nCavendish might want to attempt to engage them. She says for example\nat the start of Philosophical Letters, \nA potential problem for the view that Cavendish is making this third\nmaneuver in all cases in which she uses the word \"God\" is that there\nare texts outside of Philosophical Letters in which she uses\nthe word but is not directly responding to the view of a theistic\nopponent. But she is also clear in numerous passages that we have no\nidea of God or any other immaterials, and no idea of infinitude, and\nso it is likely that in those texts she is responding to a presumptive\nopponent, or perhaps just that she is being careful to articulate her\npiety.  \nIndeed, a final interpretive proposal is that in some cases Cavendish\nmight be using the language of immaterials to exhibit piety and\ndevotion. There is a further discussion of this proposal, and also of\nthe third maneuver, in section six below. \nFor Cavendish, philosophical inquiry is not a matter of attempting to\nconverge on an understanding of all that there is. It is instead a\nmatter of satisfying our curiosity as to the details of those things\nthat have already gotten (or that are capable of getting) our\nattention. It is a matter of attempting to converge on what our\nlanguage has designated as ‘real’. There may be things\nthat are not material, but these cannot be the subject of\ninvestigation (at least not by us). We cannot speak or think or\ntheorize about them. It would appear that strictly speaking we cannot\neven make the assertion that these things might exist, as we\ndo not have any ideas of them. Cavendish speaks of them nonetheless,\nand we are left with the interpretive question of why. \nA final argument that Cavendish offers for the view that matter thinks\nand is intelligent is from the orderly behavior of bodies. One of the\nlongstanding puzzles of seventeenth-century philosophy and science was\nhow to explain this behavior. Cudworth lays out the puzzle very\nneatly. First, he offers a trilemma: \nCudworth settles on the third horn of the trilemma after ruling out\nthe other two. Bodies are dumb and dead, and so are not the source of\ntheir own order, and it would be beneath God to attend to bodily\naffairs Himself (Cunning 2003, 348–50). Cudworth also considers\na fourth option—that the orderly behavior of bodies is secured\nby the existence of laws of\n nature.[15]\n He concludes that it is not an additional option after all but is\nsubsumed by the other three: \nHere Cudworth is pointing out, and Cavendish will agree, that we do\nnot account for the orderly behavior of bodies by positing laws of\nnature if we do not know what a law of nature is or how it operates.\nOn Cudworth's view, the orderly behavior of bodies is secured by\nimmaterial minds (or plastic natures) that attach to bodies and work\nto keep them on the rails. In something like the way that our\n(immaterial) minds intelligently guide our bodies, plastic natures\nintelligently guide the bodies that compose the plant and animal and\nmineral world. Cavendish agrees with a [highly modified] version of\nthis last statement. She will raise the objection, though, that minds\nthat move and come into contact with and attach to bodies must be\nmaterial themselves. \nLike Cudworth, Cavendish generates her view on the orderly behavior of\nbodies from a rejection of the Epicurean doctrine that the order that\nwe encounter in nature arises by chance. She writes, \nSomething is keeping bodies in line, according to Cavendish, and to do\nits job it must be active and knowledgeable and perceptive. It cannot\nbe immaterial, however, and so \nCavendish rejects the view that matter is not capable of engaging in\norderly behavior on its own. It does not require the assistance of a\nplastic nature, for example, and it is not clear how such a thing\ncould be of any help anyway. Cavendish is indeed shocked at the\ntemerity of those who think that we can speak intelligibly of an\nimmaterial divine being but then allow that some of its creatures\nwould be dead and barren. She writes, \nCavendish does not appear to allow that we can speak intelligibly of\nGod (or other immaterials), and so perhaps she is making the point\nthat if we could, we would conclude that whatever He would pack into\nsuch a proxy He would have packed into bodies in the first\n place.[18]\n They would be knowledgeable of the order that they are supposed to\nrealize, and they would know the details of the bodies in their\n vicinity.[19] \nBodies have information about the bodies in their vicinity, according\nto Cavendish, and this is in part because bodies are perceptive and in\npart because the universe is a plenum of contiguous bodies that are in\na position to communicate with each other. Cavendish offers a number\nof reasons for supposing that the universe is a plenum, including that\nnothingness can have no properties and that God would not create\nnon-being. She writes, \nCavendish will have to be careful about putting any weight on this\nlast argument, if she also holds that we have no idea of God and no\nideas of any immaterials more generally, but she does make sure to\noffer the additional argument that contains no theological premises.\nThe universe is a plenum of contiguous bodies, she supposes, and these\nbodies are also perceptive and are in regular communication with the\nbodies in their local environment. Bodies must be in communication\nwith each other, she thinks, if they are to exhibit the organized and\norderly behavior that they do. \nCavendish defends the view that the universe is a plenum of contiguous\nbodies that are perceptive and intelligent. The view is in part a\nreminder that the natural world is more active and vital than we might\nhave thought. Cavendish also leverages the view to generate a\ndistinction between natural productions, which she takes to be highly\nsophisticated and intricate, and human artifacts, whose components are\noften rushed together and, as a result, lack the history of\ncommunication and collaboration that is found in bodies that humans\nhave left untouched. Cavendish says of the bodies of nature very\ngenerally that \nThe bodies that compose an artifact are also natural bodies, of\ncourse, and so they have a history of perception and communication\nwith the bodies with which they are standardly continguous, but human\nartifice is often a matter of extracting such bodies from their normal\ncontext and putting them in a position that is foreign and unfamiliar.\nThese bodies are still perceptive, but the combinations into which\nthey are forced to enter are not as well-functioning. An everyday\nexample that might shed light on Cavendish's thinking here is the\ndifference between an office staff of individuals who have a long\nhistory of working together and a group of office workers that was\njust recently assembled. Statistically speaking the first group would\nbe able to get a lot more done. \nCavendish expects in advance that artifacts would not be as\nwell-functioning as natural productions, but she points to examples as\nwell: \nThe language here from Cavendish is no doubt strong, and she is\noverstating her case if she thinks that instruments and other\nartifacts are bound to be defective in principle. She would be right\nto note, however, that many of the instruments of her own time were\nfalse informers, at least to some degree. She would also argue that\nthe best sort of artifact is one that incorporates bodies that have a\nlong history of communication and collaboration – that is, artifacts\nthat in large part are not artifacts, but that consist of components\nthat are already productions of nature (Cunning 2016, 185-196). She\nsingles the \"perfect natural eye,\" for example, and she would argue\nthat one of the reasons that it is able to do what it does is because\nof the complexity and coordination of the smaller bodies that enter\ninto it. If we create an artificial eye, Cavendish thinks, it had\nbetter be made up of similar items. In that case, we should also be\ncareful for taking too much credit for our production, if we are\nrelying on work that had already been long underway.  \nThere are some potential problems with Cavendish's argumentation for\nthe view that matter thinks. For example, her argument that it is\ninconceivable that minds could move and not be material might seem to\ncontradict another argument that features prominently in her system\n(and that is considered more fully in section 4): namely, that most of\nthe things that happen in nature are beyond our capacity to\nunderstand. In particular, Cavendish will argue that much of what\nhappens in the natural world is incomprehensible to us in the sense\nthat we do not understand why bodies have the brute capacities by\nwhich they do all that they do. She considers the example of magnetic\nattraction, for example, and familiar Humean examples like the ability\nof certain foods to nourish, and she argues that although we do not\nunderstand how or why bodies have the capacities that they do, bodies\nhave them nonetheless. She offers all of these examples in partial\ndefense of her view that matter thinks: we do not understand how it\nthinks, but that is just a fact about us and what we are in a position\nto find intelligible. Cavendish accordingly leaves herself open to the\nobjection that although we may not understand how minds could be\nimmaterial and also partake of motion, minds might in fact be\nimmaterial movers. Cavendish might reply to this objection by making a\ndistinction between things that are inconceivable in the (strong)\nsense that there is a contradiction in our conception of them, and\nthings that are inconceivable in the weaker sense that we lack the\ncognitive resources to understand them. She might argue that\nimmaterial motion is incoherent in the former sense. An opponent might\nat the same time propose that our inability to understand how\nimmaterial minds and bodies could interact is no evidence that they do\nnot interact: instead, it is just evidence of our own cognitive\nlimitations. Cavendish would presumably reply that bodily interaction\nmust always involve contact and hence that material-immaterial\ninteraction is incoherent in the strong sense. \nAnother potential objection is in effect a reductio response\nto Cavendish's argument that the bodies that surround us need to be\nintelligent if they are to exhibit the order that they do. The\nobjection is simply that bodies are not intelligent, and so there must\nbe some other explanation for that order. Here Cavendish would just\nbite the bullet – and insist that in fact it is not a bullet – and\nrespond that a number of the predications that we make of the objects\nthat surround us presuppose that those objects are perceptive\nintelligent. We notice that ants and spiders engage in behaviors that\nare smart and sophisticated (Cunning 2016, 70-79), or to use an\nexample that Cudworth likes, that the fingers of an “exercised\nlutonist” are able to create beautiful music without being\nconscious, and without the lutonist thinking about fingers at all\n(Cudworth 1678, 157). We might point to other examples of expert\nbehavior that are more mundane, and we might reflect on how we can get\ntripped up if we attempt to bring that behavior to the level of\nattention. Cavendish herself supposes that a lot of skillful and\nadaptive human behavior takes place below the threshold of\nawareness: \nCavendish would anticipte that some of us might squirm at using\nexpressions like “muscle memory”, but she would worry that\nwhen we do squirm, we are in the grip of a theory, and a theory that\nhas us denying the obvious. Cavendish is not opposed to appealing to a\nbackground philosophy theory to help to make sense of particular\nphenomena – but she does not want to deny the paradigm cases to any\nsuch theory must be accountable. \nA different objection that Cavendish faces is that there is something\nodd in saying that minds move or that they are spatial. There are\nplenty of figures in the history of philosophy who have posited the\nexistence of entities that are not in space, even though these\nentities still in some way apply to, or are a part of, everyday\nobjects. Most famous, perhaps, is Plato's positing of the existence of\nnumbers, perfect geometrical figures, and other universal entities.\nHere Cavendish and her opponents are presumably at loggerheads. There\nmay be something odd about saying that minds move, she would insist,\nbut there is something even more odd about saying that the entirety of\nperson partakes of motion without their mind partaking of motion as\nwell. Perhaps we have immaterial minds that exist in a non-spatial\nPlatonic realm, or that are otherwise non-spatial, but these are not\nthe minds that we have in mind when we are speaking of the earthly\nentities that have imagistic and dimensional ideas and partake of\nmotion. Cavendish is in effect imploring us to take seriously that the\nlanguage of moving minds is only unusual against the background of an\nimpoverished conception of matter. \nOne of the objections that Cavendish has to address, courtesy of her\nseventeenth-century opponents, is that the prospect of thinking matter\nis unintelligible and thus that it is false that all of reality is\nmaterial. For example, Descartes insists that something is not a\nproperty of a body unless there is a conceptual tie between it and the\nessence of body: \nFor Descartes, shape is a property of bodies because something cannot\nbe a shape unless it is the shape of an extended thing. Motion is a\nproperty of bodies because something cannot have motion unless it has\na location and so cannot have motion unless it is extended (Descartes\n1644, II.25–27). Our thoughts and volitions, however, cannot be\nconceived as having length, breadth, or depth. We find a similar\nargument in the work of Malebranche: \nFor Malebranche, “the ways of being” of a body are\nrestricted to what can be understood as bearing relations of distance\nto other things. It is impossible to conceive of a thought as having a\nsize, or as being a certain distance from another thought or from a\nbody, so a thought is not a body or the property of a body (Cunning\n2006). \nCavendish could not disagree more. In tackling the question of the\nnature of mind, her first order of business is to establish\nthat matter thinks. Only then does she consider the question\nof whether or not we can understand how it thinks. She argues that we\ndo not and that it is not surprising that we do not, given that we do\nnot know the answer to hardly any of the how and why questions about\nthe things that we encounter in nature. For example, \nFor Cavendish, the fact that we do not understand how matter thinks is\nnot evidence that matter does not think. If it was, then we would have\nevidence against the occurrence of many of the phenomena that we\nencounter on a daily basis. Anticipating Hume, Cavendish is arguing\nthat particular causal relations are not known a priori, and\nthat if we did not have the relevant experience, every causal\nconnection would seem just as arbitrary as any other (Hume 1748, 112).\nThere is “Natural Magick” (Cavendish 1664, 299), according\nto Cavendish, even in the case of things that we take to be wholly\nunmysterious: \nHere Cavendish is again pre-figuring Hume. The attraction of a magnet\nis mysterious, she insists, but so is the power of fire, and the\n“Knowledge we have of several things” is on a par. This is\na sustained theme throughout her\n corpus.[21] \nFor example, we do not understand why the bodies that are involved in\ndigestion would work together to digest, rather than to do something\nelse (Cavendish 1664, 358–9). Nor do we know why the bodies that\ncompose water and ice are transparent, when the bodies that come\ntogether to form other beings are not (Cavendish 1664, 472). We can\nspeculate on these, but in the end \nThinking matter is no exception: \nBodies in the natural world clearly have capacities, Cavendish is\nmaintaining, and it is by such capacities that they do what they do.\nWe do not understand why a particular body or configuration of bodies\nwould have the particular capacities that it does, and there is no\nspecial problem posed by the fact that we cannot understand how matter\nthinks (Cunning 2006). \nAs we saw in Section 3, Cavendish's metaphysics is circumscribed\ninsofar as it does not aim to constitute a complete account of all\nthat there is. In addition, it will provide only limited accounts of\nthe things whose existence it does capture. Cavendish is fully aware\nof the limits of her project, and indeed part of that project is to\nmotivate the view that we do not understand nearly as much as we\nordinarily presume (Clucas 2003, 202–4; Broad 2007,\n496–7). Anticipating Hume yet again, and also Locke, she is\nsupposing that once we identify the line beyond which philosophical\ninquiry is no longer productive, we will devote our energies\nelsewhere, and to better effect. She writes, \nFor Cavendish and Hume, many of the sharpest minds are engaged in the\npursuit of goals that are in fact a dead end. These individuals could\nbe working on down-to-earth projects that benefit humankind generally;\nand by expressing their nature in a more sustainable way, they would\nbe happier themselves. Another case is point is the attempt that\nphilosophers might make to offer wholly perspicuous definitions or\naccounts of fundamental notions – like those of matter, motion,\ndivisibility, dependence, agency, and authority. Cavendish discusses\nthese of course, and indeed they are among the bedrocks of her\nphilosophical system, but she nowhere attempts anything like a\nfull-blown account of what they are. What she says about matter and\nits properties is especially telling –  \nFor Cavendish, there will be no explication of the nature of motion in\nterms of matter or vice versa, but that does not mean that she\nsupposes that we do not know matter or motion when we encounter them.\nShe supposes that we know these well enough to draw conclusions that\nare relevant to our most pressing matters of concern, but she does not\nthink that in order to be able to identify instances (of motion,\netc.), we have to have in hand an account of each. The order of\napproach would appear to be the other way around – a full-blown\naccount would have to do justice to incontrovertible paradigm cases;\nbut the identification of paradigm cases would not require that we\nhave in hand the more general theory that paradigm cases are supposed\nto help us to generate. Cavendish appears to be thinking that if we\nwait for a clear and full-blown account of our most rock-bottom\nnotions before we take on the pressing issues of the day, we will\nnever in fact get to them, and the discipline of philosophy will lose\nits relevance if not its luster. \nAn interesting wrinkle in Cavendish's view of the orderly behavior of\nbodies is her insistence that when bodies interact they do not\ntransfer motion to each\n other.[25]\n Instead, bodies communicate with each other about how to coordinate\ntheir behavior, and each is then the source of its own motion. On the\nassumption that properties cannot literally slide or hop from one body\nto another, cases in which one body does take on the motion of another\nbody would be cases in which the second body also takes on the matter\nthat has that motion. But we do not observe a body to become more\nmassive when it is moved as a result of its contact with another body.\nAs Cavendish explains in her description of a hand that moves a\nbowl, \nCavendish adds that “if it did, the hand would in a short time\nbecome weak and useless, by losing so much\n substance….”[26]\n She instead proposes that when one body appears to move another, it\nis simply an occasion or prompt for the second body to move on its\nown. The second body moves in the right way in response to the first\nbody (and the other bodies in its vicinity), but only because all\nbodies are intelligent and perceptive and (for the most part)\nagreeable, and they communicate with each other about how to\n proceed.[27]\n A body B might appear to acquire new motion from a body A if body B\nat first was still, or a body B might appear to be stationary after a\nbody A \"stops\" it from moving, but Cavendish supposes that bodies that\nappear to be stationary are always quite active below the surface:\n \nA given amount of motion is inseparably tied to the body that has it,\naccording to Cavendish, and so motion never transfers from a first\nbody to a second – unless of course the first body loses some of its\nmatter, in which case there is a transfer of motion, but only because\nthere is at the same time a transfer of matter. The motion that is\ntransferred is not transferred from the matter that has it; instead,\nthat matter and motion both transfer together. Cavendish supposes that\nmotion is never transferred on its own, but she also allows that a\nbody can redirect motions that another body already has. That is, a\nbody never transfers any amount of motion to a second body, but a body\ncan (and often does) redirect the motions of a second body. Bodies\nindeed often dominate other bodies and force their motions to run\ncounter to what they would otherwise be: \nA body never loses its motion, and motion is never transferred on its\nown from one body to another, but a body can redirect the motions that\na second body already has, and in a way that might give the appearance\nthat motion has been transferred. Cavendish will allow appearances to\ntell part of the story of a given body-body interaction, but she also\nmakes sure that any such story is informed by deeper metaphysical\nconsiderations like that strictly speaking a body and its motion are\ninseparable. \nA given body never loses or acquires motion, according to Cavendish.\nBodies also have enough packed into them, she supposes, that there is\na sense in which they are the cause of their own perceptions. A\npotentially counter-intuitive view, Cavendish would argue that the\navailable alternative accounts of perception make no sense at all and\nthat her own view is a close and more coherent cousin of the\nprevailing (mechanist) view of her time. First, she rejects the\nscholastic doctrine that perception of an object is a matter of\nreceiving from that object an immaterial image or species or form of\n itself.[28]\n Such a thing would have to travel from one object to another, and so\nit would have to be material. Cavendish also rejects the mechanist\nview according to which perception is a matter of unintelligent light\ntraveling from one body to another and then actively producing an\nimage of the first body in the mind of the second. She worries\nthat \nThe absurdity of the opinion needs no demonstration, but Cavendish\nelaborates in just the ways that we would expect. The opinion is\nabsurd in part because it includes that sense organs are passive and\ninert in the course of the production of sensory images. The opinion\nis also absurd because the material medium that is light does not\ncarry within itself any image of the perceived object, and so it does\nnot bring along the resources to produce a perception of that object\nspecifically, or to produce any perception at all. In her own words,\nCavendish says that it is unlikely that \nCavendish instead argues that when one body perceives another, the\nsecond body by its own power generates an image or\n“pattern” of the first body. She writes, \nFor Cavendish, perception is an almost entirely active process.\nAlthough the objects that we sense put constraints on the images that\nwe produce of them, we produce those images in their\n entirety.[29]\n Her mechanist opponents might raise the objection, and we might\nobject as well, that if Cavendish is right the power by which we\nproduce such images is mysterious and occult, and not at all\nexplanatory. Cavendish has a ready reply. According to the view of her\nopponents, the microscopic bodies that affect our senses do not have\nqualities like color or taste or smell, but they somehow are able to\nmake us have sensations of these. On this view, the color- and taste-\nand odor-less microscopic bodies might serve as a kind of trigger, but\nthe production of the relevant sensations is due in large part to\ndispositions and capacities that are found on the side of the\nperceiver. Cavendish would agree that much of the work of a sensory\nperception takes place in the perceiver. She would add that one of the\nthings that her opponents are overlooking is that, because motion is\nalways inseparable from the body that has it, the motions that enter\ninto the formation of a sensory image are the work of the perceiver as\nwell. \nCavendish holds that when one body appears to transfer motion to\nanother, the second body moves of its own accord, but does so in the\nlight of its communication with the first body. Commentators have\nworried that even if we allow Cavendish the view that bodies are\nactive and vital and the source of their own motion, she has no way to\naccount for how it is that bodies communicate so successfully with\neach other if nothing is transmitted between them. Bodies seem to\n“suggest” (Detlefsen 2007, 168), or “induc[e]”\n(O'Neill 2001, xxx), or perhaps they transmit “a sort of signal\nthat triggers the self-motion” of the body that moves\n(Michaelian 2009, 47), but the question is how they do this. As\nDetlefsen writes, \nO'Neill points the way to an answer. First, she points out that even\nthough (for Cavendish) a body never transfers its motion to a second\nbody, it still serves as a partial cause of its movement (O'Neill\n2001, xxx-xxxi). Cavendish says, \nIn line with the results of section three, Cavendish is applying the\nview that bodies must come into contact with each other in order to\ninteract. She appears to hold that at the point of mutual contact one\nbody triggers the perceptual activity and self-motion of another, but\nwe are still left with the question of how the first body does this.\nThat is, we are left with the question of how the second body comes to\nacquire all of the information that it needs to act in a coordinated\nand orderly way. Cavendish does not make clear the process by which\nthis occurs (Detlefsen 2006, 232), but she gives us enough material to\nallow us to speculate. She says that the second body forms a pattern\nof the first body; it makes a “copy” of it (Cavendish\n1668a, 187). If the second body makes a copy of the first, and if it\ndoes so at the point of interaction, then one obvious proposal is that\nthe first body presents an image of itself at that point of\ninteraction. The second body then makes a copy of that image. It is\nclear how this would work even in apparent cases of action at a\ndistance. The universe is a dense plenum of contiguous bodies that are\nperceptive and that communicate with the bodies that surround\nthem: \nIn sense perception and other cases of occasional causation,\ninformation passes through the air from one body to the next, but not\nin the form of (unintelligent) light that stamps an impression on\npassive and inert sense organs. Since the universe is a plenum,\ninformation passes from an \"agent\" body to the air that surrounds it,\nand the air then actively patterns an image of that body, and that\nimage is then patterned again – wash, rinse, and repeat – all the\nway until the \"patient\" body is reached. Along the way, some of the\nair will travel with a patterned image of the perceived object, and\nsome will communicate an image of the object to bodies that are\ncontiguous – all until the perceiver is reached. Cavendish is also\nclear that part of what it is for a body to think and be intelligent\nis for it to have\n self-knowledge,[30]\n and contiguous bodies would be regularly copying such information in\norder to maximize the coordination of behavior. In many cases, that\ninformation just happens to travel a lot farther. \nCavendish has to be to offering an account along these lines if she is\ngoing to be able to reject as less plausible the views of her\nscholastic and mechanist opponents. She herself thinks that qualities\nlike color and smell and taste literally exist in objects and that a\nperceiving body patterns all of\n these.[31]\n Microscopic bodies are not able to literally produce the resulting\nperception, and if they prompt the perceiver to produce that\nperception on its own, they also make available to the perceiver an\nimage to serve as the basis for a copy of the perceived body along\nwith its wide range of features. \nWe have seen that Cavendish holds that natural reason cannot perceive\nor have an idea of an immaterial being. She says in particular that\n“as for Immaterial, no mind can conceive that” (Cavendish\n1664, 69) and that “when we name God, we name an Unexpressible,\nand Incomprehensible Being” (Cavendish 1664, 315). One way to\nreconcile her view that we cannot have ideas of immaterials with her\nnumerous attempts to speak of God is to say that she is attempting to\nspeak in the language of her opponents. A problem, however, is that\nthere are passages in which she seems to want to be doing a lot more.\nFor example, she writes that, \nI Sent you word in my last, I would not meddle with writing any thing\nof the Divine Soul of Man, by reason it belongs to Faith and Religion,\nand not to Natural Philosophy; but since you desire my opinion\nconcerning the Immortality of the Divine Soul, I cannot but answer you\nplainly, that first I did wonder much you made me question of that,\nwhose truth, in my opinion, is so clear, as hardly any rational man\nwill make a doubt of it; for I think there is almost no Christian in\nthe world, but believes the Immortality of the Soul, no not Christians\nonely, but Mahometans and Jews: But I left to wonder at you, when I\nsaw Wise and Learned Men, and great Divines, take so much pains as to\nwrite whole Volumes, and bring so many arguments to prove the\nImmortality of the Soul, for this was a greater Miracle to me, then if\nNature had shewed me some of her secret and hidden effects, or if I\nhad seen an Immaterial Spirit. Certainly, Madam, it seems as\nstrange to me to prove the Immortality of the Soul, as to convert\nAtheists; for it is impossible, almost, that any Atheist should be\nfound in the World: For what Man would be so senceless as to deny a\nGod? Wherefore to prove either a God, or the Immortality of the Soul,\nis to make a man doubt of either: for as Physicians and Surgeons apply\nstrengthening Medicines onely to those parts of the body which they\nsuppose the weakest, so it is with proofs and arguments, those being\nfor the most part used in such subjects, the truth of which is most\nquestionable. \nHere Cavendish is stating quite straightforwardly that we can have\nfaith in the existence of immaterials, and in particular in the\nexistence of God, but that immaterials are not within the province of\nnatural reason. If so, Cavendish is reflecting the view that our best\nand only interface with God is via faith; she is reflecting her\ncommitment to fideism. \nA problem, of course, is that it would seem that a person would need\nto have an idea of God in order to have faith that God exists.\nCavendish is clear that we can have an idea of the effects of\nGod's omnipotence, but she does not think that natural reason can have\nan idea of an immaterial itself. We can have an idea that there is a\ncause of these effects, but not an idea of what the cause is, or what\nit is that makes that idea and idea of God as opposed to something\nelse. Cavendish might posit that we have supernatural and immaterial\nsouls and that these can have an idea of God, but the question again\nis how she would be entitled to make suppositions about immaterial\nsouls. One of her aims in circumscribing the limits of natural\nphilosophy is presumably to make room for faith, but there is a worry\nthat she has gone too far in holding that we cannot have ideas of\nimmaterials. As Descartes remarks, \nGod is not to be conceived or understood, according to Cavendish, but\n“is rather to be admired, adored and worshipped.” We do\nnot have any idea of Him, however, and so it is difficult to make\nsense of how our intentional states could ever point specifically in\nHis direction. \nCavendish appears to be committed to the view that the only things of\nwhich we can think or speak are the mundane things which surround us,\nor things that can come into contact with them and us but that are\nfurther off. In some passages, she refers to God and His infinitude in\norder highlight the limits of human understanding. In these passages,\nCavendish might be speaking of God in ways that are in tension with\nher view that we do not have ideas of immaterials. An alternate\nexplanation is that she might instead be attempting to rein in the\nambitions of natural reason. She writes, \nCavendish is clear in this passage that if a finite mind is able to\nsubsume a being under its necessarily limited ideas and categories,\nthen whatever that being is, it is not God. Our attempts to\ninvestigate the ways and nature of God are hopeless, and accordingly,\nwe should restrict our faculties to a subject matter to which they are\nappropriately\n fitted.[32]\n Even then, we should still be appropriately humble and fallibilistic.\nCavendish's criticism of the scientist William Harvey is a case in\npoint: \nHere Cavendish is also referencing her view that matter is eternal,\nwhich she thinks is an obvious consequence of the datum that it is\n\"impossible, to wit, that something should be made or produced out of\nnothing\" (Cavendish 1664, 53). Not wanting to ground her metaphysics\nin ideas of God that we do not have, she does not want to venture that\nGod created matter out of nothing, and the only remaining option if\nsomething cannot come from nothing is to suppose that it is eternal.\nShe wants to emphasize however that it is not heretical to say that\nthe matter out of which the earth and heavens are created has no\nbeginning of existence itself, and so in the passage immediately above\nshe highlights that there are no passages in scripture that deny that.\nCavendish is not the most humble philosopher, but she is careful to\nexercise restraint when it comes to matters that our beyond our ken.\nShe is assuming that there is a difference between the domains that\nour minds are capable of investigating and the domains that piety\nsuggests are not accessible to us. Infallibilism with respect to\neither domain is inappropriate, but it is especially so with respect\nto the\n second.[33] \nIn some passages Cavendish speaks of God to say that He is\ninconceivable and inexpressible. In other passages she speaks of God\nto say that our knowledge of His existence has to be via faith and not\nnatural reason. In other passages she speaks of God to highlight the\nways in which a finite mind should not expect to understand matters\nthat are beyond it. In other passages she speaks of God to offer\npositive evidence for her view that everything in nature is material.\nFor example, she says that it follows from the premise that God is\ngood and just that He would make sure that all of His creatures would\nbe able to worship Him, and so would make sure that all of His\ncreatures had knowledge and perception (Cavendish 1664, 518–9).\nShe also speaks of God's creation of everything, including the\nintellectual and perceptual capacities of matter, as a way of making\nsense of the teleology that we find (and that given the features of\nthe creator we would expect to find) in\n nature.[34] \nCavendish is not entitled to offer these arguments, it would seem. If\nshe is not contradicting her view that we do not have ideas of\nimmaterials, or her view that God is outside the province of natural\nreason, she might just be attempting to speak in the language of her\nopponents to show that their own (putative) commitments entail that\nher view is to be accepted instead. We know from her views on\noccasional causation that causal interaction is not a matter of an\nagent literally doing something to a patient, but of an\n“agent” communicating with a “patient” and the\n“patient” actively responding. In the case of some of the\narguments that she offers, she might just be assuming that the only\nway that she can get a response from her opponents is to speak in\nterms with which they identify. If so, she would have to discount the\narguments in question, as they could not be considered a part of\nnatural philosophy. The overall defensibility of her views would not\nbe affected so long as she had plenty of other arguments to offer\n— arguments of the sort that can be thought and expressed. \nFor all of its apparent problems, one of the reasons that it is\nimportant to remark upon Cavendish's view on our inability to conceive\nof God is to highlight that even though she thinks that the organized\nbehavior of bodies is due to intelligence, she does not subscribe to\nany version of a theory of intelligent design. There is a difference\nbetween the thesis that the orderly behavior of bodies is due to the\nintelligence and perceptual capacities of the bodies themselves and\nthe thesis that it is due to the intelligence of a designer. Cavendish\nmight add that either thesis has to posit the existence of intelligent\nand perceptive matter. If God had created matter that was not equipped\nwith the resources to detect the matter around it and act in ways that\nare coordinated, chaos would ensue almost immediately. Cavendish\nis forced to admit that if matter is intelligent and\nperceptive, there is no further explanation as to why it is\nintelligent and perceptive, or at least not one that can be known by\nnatural reason. Intelligence and perceptive matter just is. It is\nsomething that has always existed (Cavendish 1664, 14, 462) and that\nhas the resources within itself to bring about all the things that we\nobserve it to bring about on a daily basis. She would side with Hume\non the question of whether or not it is more likely that the only\nbeings that exist with such resources are immaterial: \nFor Cavendish, matter has a tremendous number of resources built into\nit. If it is eternal, then we can offer no account of its origin, but\nin this respect the competing thesis that God is the source of the\norder in the universe is on a par. The latter thesis has additional\nproblems, however: if God is wholly immaterial, then it is not clear\nhow He could produce matter, or how He would be able to interact with\nit once it was made (Cavendish 1668a, 199–200; Cavendish 1668b,\n241; Detlefsen 2009, 430); and if God's supremacy is inversely\nproportional to our finite ability to conceive of Him, it is difficult\nto see how our confidence about His nature and operations could be\nanything more than arrogance. Cavendish thinks that the view that\nmatter has always existed and is the source of its own order is not\nonly a contender, but is really the only option. \nAn issue of interpretation that arises in the attempt to reconstruct\nCavendish's social and political philosophy is that for the most part\nthe texts in which she addresses social and political questions are\nnot formal philosophical treatises but works of fiction. What is\nregarded as her central work on political philosophy, Description\nof a New World, Called the Blazing World, is a novel, and in\nanother central text, Orations of Divers Sorts, Cavendish\npresents a multiplicity of opposing perspectives on social and\npolitical topics: gender roles, virtue, war, and the proper form of\ngovernment, among others. Cavendish is indeed the author of\nBlazing World, and she also makes an appearance as a\ncharacter, but it is difficult to be certain that all of the\nconclusions and insights of the narrator are ones that Cavendish would\nidentify as her own. The interpretive problem is even worse in the\ncase of Orations, as there are as many as three or four\nspeeches that are offered on any given subject, and the speeches are\nin some cases contradictory. Still, there are a few texts in which\nCavendish puts forward claims about social and political matters and\nin which she is clearly speaking in her own voice — in\nparticular, World's Olio. We can use these claims to\ndetermine which of the perspectives she is endorsing in her more\nfictional work and to get a concrete sense of how she might follow up\non these (Boyle 2006, 253–254).  \nCavendish disagrees with Hobbes on a number of questions of natural\nphilosophy. For Hobbes, thoughts and sensations are motions in the\nbrain (Hobbes 1651, 27–28). For Cavendish thinking and\nintelligence are basic features of bodies – they are basic features\nthat are ubiquitous in nature and that admit of no further\nexplanation. Nor would Hobbes agree with Cavendish that when bodies\ninteract their rational elements communicate with each other and\nco-ordinate their behavior. But on questions of social and political\nphilosophy Cavendish and Hobbes to a significant degree align. Like\nHobbes, Cavendish holds that human beings are primarily motivated by\nself-interest: \nShe adds that self-love is “the strongest Motion of the\nMind” (Ibid.). Also like Hobbes, Cavendish thinks that life\noutside of civil society is so dangerous and chaotic that it does not\nallow us to pursue our self-interest in a stable and consistent way.\nOutside of civil society, we cannot secure food or shelter without\nthreat that they will be taken; we do not have, and we cannot create\nand sustain, the infrastructure that enables commerce; we cannot make\nplans; and the bulk of our energy is expended on security and safety\nin the moment. Orations offers multiple perspectives on\nsocial and political issues, but the emphasis on social stability is a\nconstant (Boyle 2006, 258 and 282–286): \nAs for Hobbes, for Cavendish the stability of civil society is not an\nend in itself; it is instead a necessary condition for us to pursue\nour self-interested projects and goals. If we remained in a state of\nnature, we would be in perpetual fear. We would not be likely to live\nvery long, and we would not live well. We would not be healthy. We\nwould not be able develop our latent skills and abilities, and we\nwould not be able to engage in the activities of which those skills\nand abilities are an expression. \nCavendish also agrees with Hobbes that civil society is most stable\nand secure when it is ruled by a single individual who has absolute\npower and sovereignty (Lewis 2001, 345; Boyle 2006, 282). She writes,\n \nIf a sovereign is to have absolute power, there is some risk of course\nthat they might use that power unwisely and in a way that does not\noptimally promote peace and stability. Cavendish is worried however\nabout all of the alternatives. For example, democracy is not a\nsustainable option:  \nIf the security and order of civil society is left in the hands of the\nmajority, or in the hands of a person who is selected by the majority,\nthere is too high a risk that society will return to chaos. Cavendish\nalso holds that power should not be in the hands of a smaller but very\ntalented and intelligent and sophisticated minority: she appears to\nthink that the likelihood is high that such a body will become divided\nand govern ineffectively, perhaps because “It is the nature of\nmost of Mankind … to be Ungratefull, Malicious, Revengefull,\nand Inhumane” (Cavendish 1662a, 259). The members of such a body\nmight be in perpetual conflict as a result of honest disagreement or\nas a result of their ambition to have more power for themselves.\nCavendish concludes that the best prospect for security and stability\nthough to be sure this is not a guarantee — is to have all power\nin the hands of a single\n individual.[35] \nCavendish does not get into a lot of detail about how the sovereign\nshould best bring about peace and security, but she does offer a\nnumber of suggestions. In Blazing World, she depicts a scene\nin which the Empress returns to her home world (from the Blazing\nWorld) and saves her people from an enemy attack. The Empress is\ndepicted as possessing super-human abilities, as having the\nall-encompassing breadth and reach and power of a god: \nWhile still on Blazing World, the Empress had received intelligence\nthat her people were under attack and that their kingdom was likely to\nbe destroyed (90). The clear suggestion is that peace and security are\nbest secured and maintained if a country is governed by a sovereign\nwho is and is believed to be capable of the extraordinary. The\nsovereign should not be selected by democracy, and ideally the\nsovereign will be one of the few who is naturally born with the\ntalents that are requisite to do the job: \nIt is difficult to resist the thought that Cavendish is writing in\npart with an eye to Hobbes and the problem of the fool (Hobbes 1651,\n90). To the subject who thinks that it is rational to break the\ncovenants of civil society, and who thinks that he can get away with\nit, Cavendish is suggesting that a capable sovereign would make sure\nthat subjects have reason to believe that the eyes and ears of the\nsovereign are ubiquitous and that situations in which a subject\nconcludes that is he under the radar are likely to be situations that\nthe sovereign has had skillfully and majestically staged. Perhaps\nCavendish is also suggesting that there is no good Hobbesian response\nto the problem of the fool in that she is fleshing out what a\nsovereign would have to be to make the behavior of the\n“fool” count as irrational, and how a sovereign cannot\nrealistically be anything close to that. \nCavendish also does not speak in a lot of detail about how a sovereign\nis established or about the formation of a commonwealth. She appears\nto assume that a sovereign will emerge from the among the most\npowerful and talented and that the majority of people will come to see\nsubjugation as in their overall interest. She does however sketch some\nparameters that she thinks a wise sovereign will keep in mind, and\nthese parameters tend to be in keeping with her occasionalist view\nthat things or persons have power not as a function of what they force\nonto their objects but as a function of whether or not these objects\nrespond to the person or thing as requested. For example, Cavendish\nsays that a wise sovereign will be fair and consistent in the\napplication and enforcement of laws (Cavendish 1655, 112). The\nsovereign will also be a model of virtue, and in a way that allows his\nor her subjects to register that the highest forms of happiness and\npleasure do not in fact accompany the life of vice. (Cavendish 1664b,\n114) A wise sovereign will also make sure that subjects have access to\nletters and to education more generally — to poetry that softens\nour animalistic and reactive side (Cavendish 1655, 64); to plays and\nother representations that not only articulate and defend but also\nexhibit the virtues and joys that come with enacting them; and also\nphilosophy and history (Cavendish 1655, 6). Cavendish writes, \nOne of the benefits of an education is that our minds become more\nfilled with information that helps us to navigate the world —\nnot only to achieve our local aims but to work toward the more global\nresult of peace and security (Boyle 2006, 285–287). Cavendish\ndoes not think that we can achieve these aims blindly and by a brute\nact of will. We need knowledge and familiarity with the ways of the\nworld, and we cannot come up with these by a brute act of will either.\nHere it appears that Cavendish's view on occasional causation is\nmaking a systematic appearance yet again. Ecosystems and other\ncollections of bodies are able to sustain themselves in existence, in\nlarge part because of the skillful communication that takes place\nbetween their members. A commonwealth will have a better chance of\nsurviving for the long haul if its members are prepared to listen to\neach other and if they are in synchrony with respect to a larger aim\nand if they have the wherewithal to respond to each other\nintelligently and without resistance. \nCavendish would also recommend that a sovereign hold constant the\nextent to which human beings are driven by the pursuit of public\nrecognition and fame. Cavendish herself thinks that our material minds\ndo not live on after we die and that, if we have immaterial souls that\ncontinue to exist, we have absolutely no notion of these or how or why\nwe would identify with them. She thinks that deep down the rest of us\nare suspicious as well: \nCavendish is very astute to point out the extent to which human beings\nare motivated by a desire for public recognition. She saw the evidence\nin her own day, and we can clearly see it in our\n own.[36]\n She can then argue that if generally speaking people are interested\nin the promotion of peace and stability, one of the ways that an\nindividual will have a good chance at achieving fame is by engaging in\nactivities and projects that help to secure peace and stability. These\nwould include inventions, infrastructure, and the construction of\nschools and libraries (Boyle 2006, 264). A wise sovereign will make\nsure that such behavior is encouraged and that it is also\nacknowledged. Not everybody is noble and exalted and impressive by\nbirth, and not everybody has all of the same talents (Cavendish 1655,\n69; Cavendish 1662a, 27, 37–38), but there are still a number of\nways that any human being can contribute to peace and stability.\nSociety can be structured so that people can work to their own talents\nand be acknowledged for what they do well — whether they be\nscientists, philosophers, laborers, members of the military, writers,\nor something else — and a wise sovereign would recognize all of\nthese achievements so that a person would not be motivated to secure\nfame in ways that are more unseemly. We are remembered well if we do\nour part to promote peace and social stability. And it is only if\nsociety lives on, and is stable and orderly and civilized, that there\nwill be people who might remember us. \nAnother issue that comes up in interpreting Cavendish's social and\npolitical philosophy is whether or not she is a feminist. It is\ntempting again to look to her view on occasional causation to shed\nlight on her view of the proper roles for females and males. Cavendish\nherself wanted to be a practicing scientist and philosopher, but\nwhether or not she could be so was a function not only of her\ndecisions but also of the receptivity of the surrounding world. She\ncould decide to be a scientist, but whether or not she would be a\nscientist is up to a lot of additional factors — whether her\nresults are disseminated and discussed, whether they are published,\nwhether she is taken seriously and seen as authoritative, and whether\nshe is part of a larger scientific community. Alternately, she (or a\nCavendish in a nearby possible world) might decide to open a business,\nor be a constable or barrister, but whether or not she is successful\nwould depend only in part on what she decides to do. To be a\nbusinessperson she would need to have a customer base, and to be an\nattorney she would need to be authoritative and believable in front of\nthose who deliver a verdict. Cavendish was not a prominent scientist\nin her time; nor was she a prominent philosopher. She attempted to\ncorrespond with Hobbes and others, but unlike the bodies that interact\nin constituting the ecosystems of nature and other organic units,\nthese philosophers were not cooperative. \nIn her natural philosophy Cavendish argues that the behavior of bodies\nis due in part to messages that are signaled from the\n“agent” body and in part to the response of the\n“passive” body and to whether or not the\n“passive” body is appropriately hospitable. Some of the\ntexts suggest very strongly that her social and political philosophy\nis informed by her view of the normal operations of nature. In\nBlazing World, the Empress is transported from her home\nplanet and is pleased to find that the beings on the Blazing World\nwill interact with her and respect her authority. In real life, the\nhuman males on earth would not engage with Cavendish, but the worm-men\nand bear-men and bird-men and fish-men and ape-men have extensive\nconservations with the Empress about the cosmos, the nature of matter\nand mind, chemistry, and mathematics (29–42). At one point the\nEmpress seeks counsel from “the soul of one of the most famous\nmodern writers, as either of Galileo, Gassendus, Descartes, Helmont,\nHobbes, H. More, etc.” (67–68). She is informed, however,\nthat “they would scorn to be scribes to a woman” (68). The\natmosphere of the Blazing World is quite different from the atmosphere\non earth, and whether or not a person is a scientist or philosopher or\nother authority is only in part dependent on what is happening on her\nend. \nCavendish presents women as accomplished and successful in other texts\nas well. In Bell in Campo, Cavendish has a group of women\nform an army for the sake of showing men that women should be\n“co-partners” in government, and “help rule the\nWorld” (588–589). The women submit to a powerful\ngeneralless, and together they defeat the enemy and save the male army\nat the same time. The events in Bell in Campo are fairly\nstraightforward, but there might remain a question about Cavendish's\nown attitude toward those events, and in particular about her attitude\ntoward the achievements of the female army. On the one hand, it is\nreported in Bell in Campo that men take women to be “a\ntrouble in the Commonwealth” (588). In addition, the members of\nthe female army are rewarded for their achievements — rewarded\nby the men in power — with the right to control their family\nfinances, and the freedom to wear whatever they choose. On the other\nhand, Cavendish depicts the female army as being capable of doing what\na male army is normally commissioned to do, and as capable of doing\neven more. Furthermore, she is depicting how males in power would in\nfact respond (or how the males in her own world have responded) to a\ncircumstance in which a female army sweeps in to save the day. On one\nreading, Cavendish herself is suggesting that men and women are not\nequal in terms of the roles that they should perform and that men are\nin important ways superior. On another reading, Cavendish is\nreflecting that men are not superior to women but that the\nachievements of women have always occurred in an atmosphere in which\nmen are heavily advantaged. \nSome commentators have suggested that Cavendish leaves open the\nquestion of whether or not women are inferior by training and\neducation or if they are inferior by nature (for example Boyle 2006,\n278–281). It seems unlikely that Cavendish thinks that women are\ninferior by nature if she depicts women as capable of the highest\nlevels of achievement in alternative possible worlds. Women are still\nwomen in these alternative worlds; what is different is the\nstructure of the surrounding audiences with which men and women have\nto contend. Cavendish herself was a remarkable person, as was the\nEmpress and the generalless of Bell in Campo. It is true that\nwomen are depicted as exceptional only in Cavendish's fictional work\n(McGuire 1978, 198; Boyle 2006, 279), and that might indicate that she\ntakes the idea of a skilled and capable woman to be fictional, but as\nper her view on occasional causation she might just be reflecting in\nthese alternative worlds that what it is for an agent to be successful\nis in part due to what the agent signals and in part to how its larger\nenvironment is responsive. Cavendish might have thought (with Spinoza)\nthat an individual is not an island and that what it can do and cannot\ndo is to some degree a part of its physical and psychological\nconstitution and to a large degree a part of the lay of the land on\nwhich the individual would act. \nCavendish does however encourage a very conservative set of behaviors\nfor women to perform, and again the question arises of whether she is\nbasing her view on some assumptions about the nature of women more\ngenerally or if she has an eye to the environment in which women have\nhappened to find themselves. In World's Olio she emphasizes\nthe importance of the virtue of chastity, and also patience, humility\nand being fashionable and constant (73). The list is expanded by one\nof the speakers of Orations: \nHere Cavendish might be reflecting how women ought to behave in any\npossible world irrespective of the power and responses of the beings\nthat surround them. If she thinks that the nature of women is such\nthat women should be chaste and humble and quiet, then to the extent\nthat she thinks that other characteristics are higher and more exalted\nshe takes women to be an inferior part of the species. If she is\ninstead reading off of her own world what behaviors are regarded as\nlegitimate for women, then she is just describing the behavior that is\nadaptive to that environment. The generalless of Bell in\nCampo is not especially modest or temperate or quiet, but her\nbehavior would not “gain us praise” or “love in this\nworld” — the seventeenth-century environment in which\nCavendish thinks we find ourselves. But perhaps Cavendish thinks that\nthe generalless is operating counter to her own nature. Alternately,\nif Cavendish is reading off of her culture how women would be most\nwise to behave, then she might just be offering conservative advice\nabout how women can best flourish in the short material life that has\nbeen allotted to them. \nA final interpretive issue that arises for Cavendish is exactly how\nthe sovereign is supposed to have so much power and authority if power\nand achievement are in large part a function of the responsiveness of\nthe surrounding world. A sufficiently powerful sovereign would have to\nhave full control of the military and other underlings, and these in\nturn would need to be able to control the larger populace (James 2003,\nxxv-xxvi). The sovereign would have to have enough power to force all\nof these people to act in accord with his or her will, but in the\nlight of her view on occasional causation Cavendish is committed to\nthe view that all that a sovereign would be able to do is send a\nsignal or message to these beings in the hope that they would obey.\nThe sovereign might try to take steps to increase the odds that\nunderlings will abide by his message, but that would be a matter of\nsending another message still. A sovereign cannot simply decree that\ncertain things happen: whether or not they happen is a function of the\nresponsiveness of the members of the commonwealth. For Cavendish, an\necosystem holds together, but not because a single member imposes its\nwill on the others. Instead, the members work together as a group, and\nif human beings are a part of nature, they would function under the\nsame constraints. If Cavendish is right, a sovereign has to be\nextremely powerful to secure peace and stability, but what it is for a\nsovereign to have power is to be wise enough to figure out which are\nthe messages that his subjects would accommodate (also Walters 2014,\n180-182)  \nLike many of her seventeenth-century contemporaries, Cavendish\nsubscribes to the view that the universe is a plenum of contiguous\nbodies and that there is no empty space. We might wonder how\nindividual bodies would have any freedom or wiggle room to behave as\nthey please if they are so surrounded and tightly packed in. Cavendish\ndoes defend the view that the bodies of nature are generally speaking\nfree; indeed the view is a pillar of her system. She writes for\nexample that \nBodies are free, Cavendish supposes, but she has not yet taken a stand\non whether the freedom of bodies is of a libertarian or a\ncompatibilist variety. She does not use these contemporary terms\nherself, of course, and so the question is whether or not she cashes\nout freedom in terms of a contra-causal power by which bodies possess\nthe ability to do otherwise than they do – again, even if she does\nnot use that language – or if she takes freedom to be a matter of the\nwherewithal that a body has to act by the motions that are internal to\nit and to keep those motions from being squelched or redirected by an\nobstacle or hindrance. She nowhere speaks in these exact\nterms either, but she does make some comments that are very\nrevealing. \nFor example, she defines voluntary motion as self-motion, and she\ndescribes the freest bodies at those that are able to make their way\nthrough the plenum with agility and without constraint. She\nwrites, \nWe might want to be more skeptical of this last passage, because\nCavendish is making a claim that makes reference to the nature and\nactivity of being of which she thinks we have no idea, but the claim\nis still suggestive. Bracketing a miracle, nothing can happen in\nnature other than it in fact happens, she is saying, but she also\nsupposes that bodies are still generally speaking free. They are free,\nshe indicates in the other two passages, when their activity and\nbehavior is not obstructed or constrained. \nThere are numerous passages throughout the corpus in which Cavendish\ndescribes bodies as free, but there are just a few in which she\nfleshes out what it is to which the freedom of a body amounts. In\nthese, her view is squarely compatibilist. There are also passages in\nwhich address the issue of free will from a theological perspective --\nwhere she considers whether or not an omniscient God would have\npreordained all things from eternity or whether God would have left\nthe behavior of creatures more open (for example in Cavendish 1668a,\n295-296, \"Further Observations Upon Experimental Philosophy\") – but\nin these she is careful to suspend judgment. Her view appears to be\nthat bodies are free in the sense that for the most part the bodies\nthat surround them are cooperative and do not prevent them from moving\nas they please, and that bodies are not free when other bodies\ndominate them or otherwise force a redirection of their motions. Other\npassages suggest a compatibilist reading of the free behavior of\ncreatures as well: \nIn a plenum of contiguous bodies, a body will sometimes redirect the\nmotions of a second body in way that that body resists, and in such\ncases the behavior of the second body is not free. In other cases the\nbehavior of the second body is amenable to the redirection of motion,\nand in yet other cases still, a body moves by way of motions that (of\ncourse) are internal to it, and without any outside interference or\nobstruction. In these cases the bodies are in effect cooperating with\neach other, and the behavior of the second body is free – even though\nit would not appear to have a contra-causal ability to do otherwise.\nIt has the motions that it has; it will not be the spontaneous source\nof any new motion, nor will it acquire any new motion from other\nbodies. It has the motions that it has, and it acts accordingly. \nOne potential objection to a compatibilist reading of Cavendish on\nfreedom is that there are numerous passages in her corpus in which she\nsays that bodies behave in a manner that is irregular. If bodies\nexhibit irregularity and disorder, they would appear to be in\npossession of a faculty of spontaneity, and Cavendish would appear to\nhold that in at least some instances they exercise freedom of the\nlibertarian variety. \nHere are some of the passages in which Cavendish speaks of\nirregularities that occur in nature: \nCavendish certainly speaks of irregularities and disorder, but there\nare also passages in which she steps back and says that what she has\nin mind when she speaks of an irregularity is just an entity or event\nthat appears irregular to us against the background of our\nexpectations and conceptions. She says for example that \nThere are a couple of different ways to read the passages in which\nCavendish speaks of irregularities in nature. One is to count them up\nand argue that because they outnumber the competing passages – and\nthey do – Cavendish holds that irregularities are real. Another is to\nargue that she holds that there exist no irregularities at all. On\nthis approach, we would emphasize the passages in which she says that\nwe identify something as an irregularity when it runs counter\nto our expectations. Any such passage would be treated as a kind of\nmeta-text that is instructing us how to read the passages in which\nirregularities are introduced. In that case, Cavendish could speak of\nirregularities in a million passages or even more, but if she also\ntells us that all that she means by the term \"irregularity\" is\nsomething that runs counter to our expectations, then there is no need\nto count up the passages pro and con. They are all consistent with the\nview that nature exhibits an exceptionless order.  \nCavendish holds that what it is for a being to be free is for it to\nhave the wherewithal to do as it pleases without obstacle or\ninterference. She holds that many beings are in fact unfree, because\nthey have goals and aims that the surrounding world of objects works\nto thwart and prohibit. Cavendish's own goals of being a philosopher\nand scientist and political leader are a case in point. In many of her\ntexts she proposes that an appropriate response to the obstacles and\nconstraints of the real-world plenum is to develop and employ our\nfaculty of imagination to model alternative worlds that are more\namenable to our values, interests, and needs. She suggests a number of\nreasons why the construction of imaginary worlds might be of benefit:\n(1) they allow us to experience a version of the life that we are\nblocked from pursuing in the actual world; (2) they are enjoyable to\ninhabit; (3) they allow us to hold onto the self with which we\nidentify when the actual world does not room for us to express it; (4)\nthey allow us to register for the record and for posterity why that\nself was not a viable option. \nCavendish writes in \"To all Noble and Worthy Ladies,\" a preface to\nBlazing World, that if the real life blocks her from\nembodying a life with which she identifies, she will construct an\nanalogue of that life in her imagination. She writes, \nCavendish supposes that imaginary worlds are enjoyable to inhabit.\nHere she is reflecting a view that is uncontroversial, at least if we\ntake seriously the level of pleasure that individuals seem to secure\nfrom getting lost in a book or play or other fictional realm. A person\nwill sometimes encounter a significant amount of frustration in their\nday-to-day life, for example in their job or their personal\nrelationships, and that person might be quite impatient to return a\nstory in which they have been immersed. Cavendish herself suggests\nthat in a vividly imagined world can be a source of greater\nsatisfaction than the world that is in front of us: \nCavendish also has some of the characters in her fiction express a\nsimilar view. In The Lady Contemplation, the main character\nproposes that \nWe might concede that Cavendish is right that a fictional world can\noften be a welcome alternative to our actual everyday affairs (also\nWalters 2014, 167-168), but we might worry that she is overstating the\ncase if she supposes that we can be just as fulfilled imagining a life\nwith which we identify as we can by living it in fact. There is a\ndifference between inhabiting a world of fictional characters – for\nexample in an engrossing book or play – and inhabiting a world that\nrepresents our own longing for a life that has been denied to us. To\ninhabit the latter sort of world might just bring despair. Cavendish\ndoes not appear to think so, however, but she might also be supposing\nthat there is pleasure in capturing for the record why a particular\nworld has been cut off from us, rather than just allowing ourselves to\ndissolve into one of the lives that has been made available. She might\nalso be supposing that we can achieve an afterlife of fame if we write\nabout alternative worlds and what they have going for them, in a way\nthat helps them to come to be. If there is an alternative world that\nis much more desirable than the one in which we find ourselves, a\nwritten record of it might have both a personal and a social\nimpact. \nCavendish indeed speaks in a wide spectrum of texts of the ways in\nwhich the seventeenth-century world that surrounds her is not as\naccommodating to the pursuits and goals of women as it is to the\npursuits and goals of men. In some of these texts she says that the\nclimate for women has been so hostile that it is in fact true that\nwomen do not have the same capacities as men: women are either denied\nthe relevant training and expertise, or they are not taken seriously\nand their capacities are not allowed a platform. She writes, \nIn this last passage Cavendish is suggesting that one outlet for the\nenergies of an individual who is blocked from pursuing their more\noutwardly directed aspirations is to write. In Blazing World,\nBell in Campo, and other texts, Cavendish indeed utilizes\nthat outlet to enact roles that are regularly denied to women in the\nplenum of seventeenth-century England. The plenum does not allow women\nto take on any number of roles, and it does not advance them the\nopportunity to acquire the requisite skill and training and know-how.\nBut even if women did acquire that training, there is an\nimportant sense in which they would still lack the capacities for the\nroles in question. Consider the following scene that Cavendish\nconstructs in the Introduction to her Playes: \nWe might consider alternative cases that are just as easy to envision\n-- a woman who is highly trained as doctor or attorney, but who does\nnot come across as sufficiently authoritative to a patient or jury; an\nAsian-American who is a seriously talented actor but who cannot get a\nrole in a movie except as a caricature, if that is what audiences are\nwilling to see; a highly-trained African American carpenter who has\ntrouble getting hired to build a backyard fence or deck if that means\nleaving him with a key to enter the house during the day; a figure\nlike Mersault in Camus's The Stranger, who would have easily\nmerited acquittal by self-defense if he had not come across as such an\noutsider. In all of these cases, there are the motions that take place\non the side of the agent, and there are the motions that occur in the\noutside environment. Cavendish is pointing out that our ability to\nlive a life with which we identify is a function of both kinds of\nmotion and that the second kind of motion is much more amenable to\nsome than to others. The judge and jury in all such cases do not\nnecessarily run through a conscious pattern of exclusionary reasoning\nto single out the agent in question; there might just be a feeling of\ndiscomfort, and often it is easiest to take the path of least\nresistance. \nThere are number of explicit reasons that Cavendish suggests as to why\nthe construction of imaginary worlds would be of benefit. There are\nadditional reasons that she might have as well, but to posit these on\nher behalf is a bit more speculate and requires further research. The\nreasons include: (5) they allow us to model a picture of a world that\nmight come to be – that is, to model a route by which we might get\nthere, and to shine a light on otherwise invisible obstacles that\nmight be in our way; (6) they habituate other minds and ready them for\nchange that would otherwise feel sudden and abrupt; and (7) written\nrecords of the most successful of our imaginings might survive and\nsecure us an afterlife of fame. Cavendish was fairly conservative in\nher politics, but that does not mean that the she did not single out\nparticular phenomena for criticism, and it does not mean that she had\nan in-principle aversion to social change. In passages that we have\nconsidered, she certainly takes issue with practices that perpetuate\ngender inequality, and she models science-fictional worlds that expose\nhow that inequality would be dramatically reduced if our own world\nwere very different. She also indicates in some passages that an\nadvantage of modeling alternative scenarios in imagination, as opposed\nto straightforwardly imposing them on the world, is that certain kinds\nof violence and unrest can be avoided. In the Epilogue to Blazing\nWorld, she writes, \nIn this passage, Cavendish speaks to the way in which participation in\nfictional stories does not lead to some of the difficult and\nproblematic consequences that would occur if those stories unfolded in\nreal life. We know that Cavendish witnessed the horrors of civil war\nin her own time, and she might subscribe to the view that social\nchange needs to be gradual if it is to occur at all and not lead to\nsuch consequences – in particular, to the kind of backlash that sets\nprogress back further still. Writing is no doubt a platform that can\nmake more malleable some of the resistance to social change. If a\ntradition is predominant and entrenched, and a critical mass of\nindividuals benefit from its continued existence, the attempt to\noverturn it in real life will be countered with at least as much\nforce. Imagination would appear to be more fluid, and over the long\nhaul a vividly entertained scenario might become so familiar as to be\ninnocuous. If we are the author of that scenario, we might even become\nfamous for playing a part to change the world.  \nCavendish's philosophical work was not taken very seriously in the\nseventeenth century, but it is certainly relevant today. She is\npresumably right to warn about the inconsistency in insisting that God\nis utterly transcendent while being utterly confident in putting\nforward claims about His nature. She has also anticipated a\ncontemporary emphasis on the study of the brain and body in addressing\nmental health. In addition, she has made a contribution to the current\ndebate about whether or not our inability to understand how matter\nthinks is relevant to the question of whether or not it does think\n(McGinn 1999, 6–18; Chalmers 1996, 3–6; and Nagel 1974,\n435–450). She is also important insofar as she anticipates the\narguments and views of early modern thinkers who are firmly in the\ncanon and who already secure a great deal of attention. Finally, she\noffers extremely compelling insights into issues of agency and\nauthority. She argues that one of the reasons why an individual is\noften unsuccessful in embodying a life with which they identify is\nthat, even if everything is in order on the side of their decisions\nand talents and skills, there is often social and political corrosion\nin the interface between their decisions and the world.","contact.mail":"david-cunning@uiowa.edu","contact.domain":"uiowa.edu"}]
