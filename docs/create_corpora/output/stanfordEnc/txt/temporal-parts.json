But how do they persist through time?\nAccording to some philosophers, things have temporal parts as well as\nspatial parts: accepting this is supposed to help us solve a whole\nbunch of metaphysical problems, and keep our philosophy in line with\nmodern physics. Other philosophers disagree, arguing that neither\nmetaphysics nor physics give us good reason to believe in temporal\nparts. \n\nYou’re performing an amazing trick right now: you’re in\ntwo places at once. How do you manage to be down there, near the\nfloor, and yet also be a metre or two up in the air? Well, it’s\nnot so very amazing: your feet are down there on the floor, and your\nhead is up in the air. Having spatial parts enables you to be in\nseveral different places, and to have different properties in\ndifferent places: you’re cold down there on the tiled floor, and\nalso warm up there by the heater, because your feet are cold and your\nhead is warm. Moreover, having parts could let you be in the same\nplace as someone else: if you shared a hand with a conjoined\n(‘Siamese’) twin, then you could both wear the same glove\nwithout jostling for space. \nNone of this is special to people: inanimate objects also extend\nthrough space by having spatial parts. They have different properties\nin different places, and sometimes they overlap by sharing their\nparts. These simple facts about spatial parts explain basic features\nabout the way things and people occupy space. \nThings and people take up time as well as taking up space: you existed\nyesterday, and, unless reading this article is a real strain, you will\nexist tomorrow too. Just as you can have different properties at\ndifferent places (hot up here, cold down there), you can have\ndifferent properties at different times (yesterday you hadn’t\nheard of temporal parts, by tomorrow you’ll know plenty about\nthem).  \nSome philosophers believe that you take up time by having different\ntemporal parts at different times. Your spatial parts are things like\nyour head, your feet and your nose; your temporal parts are things\nlike you-yesterday, you-today and you-tomorrow. If you have different\ntemporal parts, this would explain how you can exist at different\ntimes, and it would also explain how you can have different properties\nat different times (you-yesterday hasn’t heard of temporal\nparts, you-tomorrow is an expert). According to these philosophers,\nthen, persisting through time is pretty much like extending through\nspace: it’s all a matter of parts. \nOther philosophers reject this picture. They argue that you persist\nthrough time as a whole: it’s not just a part of you sitting in\nfront of the computer right now, it’s you, the whole you! It was\nthe very same whole person yesterday who knew nothing about temporal\nparts, and, by tomorrow, the very same whole person will be an expert.\n‘You-yesterday’ isn’t a name for some mysterious\npart of you which only existed for a day; instead, it’s a\nstilted way of talking about you, and what you were like\nyesterday. \nDiscussions of time, space, identity and change have been part of\nphilosophy since its earliest days, and not every question about\npersistence obviously concerns temporal parts. For example, can we\ngive criteria of identity through time for artefacts, animals or\npeople? What happens to a ship if you replace all of its planks one by\none? What if you keep the old planks, then build a new ship out of\nthem? In addressing these questions during recent decades, however, it\nhas proven useful to discuss whether objects have temporal parts,\nbecause the answers that philosophers give to these questions can\noften depend upon whether they believe in temporal parts. \nThis article is divided into a number of sections. Section 2 looks\nmore closely at what exactly temporal parts are supposed to be, and at\nwhat sorts of things are supposed to have them. Sections\n 3,\n 4 and\n 5\n look at a range of arguments in favour of believing in temporal\nparts, and at the responses of those who reject temporal parts.\n Section 6\n discusses connections between debate about temporal parts, and debate\nabout the nature of time more generally.\n Section 7\n considers whether physics can teach us anything about temporal parts.\n Section 8\n discusses a question internal to temporal-parts theories: what\nrelationship is there between the different temporal parts of a single\nobject?  Finally,\n section 9\n touches on special concerns about the persistence of people through\ntime. \nThe two most popular accounts of persistence are perdurance theory\n(perdurantism) and endurance theory (endurantism). Perdurantists\nbelieve that ordinary things like animals, boats and planets have\ntemporal parts (things persist by ‘perduring’).\nEndurantists believe that ordinary things do not have temporal parts;\ninstead, things are wholly present whenever they exist (things persist\nby ‘enduring’). This looks like a straightforward\nontological disagreement, a dispute about what exists. Perdurantists\nthink that objects have both spatial and temporal parts, while\nendurantists think that they only have spatial parts. \nFrom an endurantist point of view, however, it is difficult even to\nsay what temporal parts are supposed to be. Your temporal parts are\nparts of you which lie in the past or in the future. But endurantists\nagree that you have different spatial parts at different times: you\nexchange molecules with the environment, you grow new hairs or lose a\ntooth to decay. So, yes, some of your (former) parts lie in the past,\nand some of your (future) parts lie in the future, but that\ndoesn’t mean that you’re somehow less than a whole person,\nright here and now. Why do perdurantists make such a big deal of the\nobvious fact that you have different parts at different times? \nEndurantists think about what parts you have at different times, past,\npresent or future. But perdurantists prefer to think atemporally about\nwhat parts you have, full stop (what parts you have, period). And they\nclaim that you have you-yesterday, you-today and you-tomorrow amongst\nyour parts. Endurantists don’t accept this atemporal way of\ntalking about parthood, and so they find it difficult even to say what\nthey don’t like about temporal parts. \nWhat moral should we draw from this communication breakdown? Some\nperdurantists think ‘so much the worse for endurantists: they\ncan’t even say what they’re against’. Some\nendurantists think ‘so much the worse for perdurantists: their\ntheory doesn’t even make sense’. And some philosophers on\nboth sides look for a neutral way to spell out the notion of a\ntemporal part (for more detail on this, see the reading suggestions at\nthe end of this section). For now, let’s take it that the basic\nidea of a temporal part is well-enough understood, perhaps via the\nanalogy with spatial parts; later sections will show how the idea is\nput to work. \nSo the two standard views of persistence are endurance and perdurance\ntheories. But there are also non-standard views.  According to\nmixed views, some persisting objects have temporal parts, and others\ndo not. For example, perhaps changing objects have temporal parts,\nwhilst objects with unchanging intrinsic natures do not. Or perhaps\nontologically self-sufficient things like organisms don’t have\ntemporal parts, but ontologically dependent things like ocean waves,\nsmiles or universities do. (Most endurantists, perdurantists and\nothers agree that processes or events have temporal parts: whether or\nnot I have earlier and later parts, my birthday party certainly\ndoes.) \nOther non-standard views take the basic perdurantist idea that\npersistence is much like spatial extension, then they develop the idea\nin different ways. For example, perhaps persisting things stretch out\nfour-dimensionally through time, but without being subdivided into\ntemporal parts. Or perhaps, as stage theorists claim, the world is\nfull of four-dimensional objects with temporal parts, but when we talk\nabout ordinary objects like boats and people, we talk about brief\ntemporal parts or ‘stages’ of four-dimensional\nobjects. \nHow is this supposed to work? Imagine that someone refers to you by\nname. According to perdurantists, the name refers to a\nninety-year-long (let’s hope) four-dimensional object. According\nto stage theorists, the name refers to a brief part of that\nninety-year-long object, a different one at different times. This\nsounds peculiar: after all, your name refers to you and you have a\nfuture (and quite a past), while stages exist only momentarily. Stage\ntheorists say that when we speculate about what you’re going to\ndo next week, our speculations are made true or false by the behaviour\nof your counterparts next week. These future counterparts of yours are\nthe very objects which, according to perdurantists, are your future\ntemporal parts. \nJust how brief are temporal parts or stages? Typically, objects which\nhave any temporal parts are thought to have instantaneous temporal\nparts (‘time-slices’), which do not themselves persist\nthrough time. (Most perdurantists think that things have\nnon-instantaneous temporal parts too, like you-during-1999.) But an\nalternative is to claim that an object has only as many temporal parts\nas it has genuinely differentiated periods in its existence; this is a\nmixed view, because changing objects will have temporal parts, while\nunchanging objects and temporal parts will persist without having\ntemporal parts of their own. \nSome philosophers and some non-philosophers suspect that debate about\nwhether things have temporal parts is empty, that there is no genuine\nissue at stake here. One idea is that we can’t know for sure\nwhether things have temporal parts: all the theories on offer have\ngood and bad aspects and we’ll never find an undisputed\nchampion. If this is true, it doesn’t undermine the debate\nunless consensus and certainty are our only goals. A second idea is\nthat metaphysical enquiry is pointless, since irrelevant to daily\nlife. This claim needs support from accounts of relevance, and of the\nconnection between irrelevance and pointlessness. A third idea is that\nmetaphysical enquiry is doomed to fail because there are no absolute\nmetaphysical truths. This claim needs support from accounts of truth,\nlanguage and reality. All of these topics are too grand for this\narticle. A fourth idea is the much more focused claim that, while\ncertain metaphysical disputes are legitimate, the debate about\ntemporal parts is empty: this doubt may be reinforced by the\ndifficulty of giving a neutral account of what temporal parts are\nsupposed to be, or by scepticism about the so-called ‘problem of\nchange’, as discussed in the next section. \nAs noted above, the debate between endurantists and perdurantists is\nan ontological dispute: do temporal parts of ordinary material objects\nexist, or not? Moreover the endurantist notion of ‘being wholly\npresent’ was understood in terms of parts and wholes. In the\npast few years, however, some have suggested that debates about\npersistence are better understood as debates about location –\nhow are material objects located in (or extended through) time, and\nhow does this compare with the way(s) in which material objects are\nlocated in (or extended through) space? Temporal parts were introduced\nat the beginning of this entry via an analogy with spatial parts, but\nthis recent work challenges even the assumption that\nspatially-extended objects inevitably have spatial parts. The present\narticle focuses, appropriately enough, on persistence questions\nunderstood via the notion of temporal parthood, but you can read about\nalternative approaches in the separate entry on\n Location and Mereology,\n especially section 6.3.2. \nBefore we plunge into arguments about whether temporal parts exist,\nit’s worth clarifying some terminology. First: perdurance theory\nis sometimes called ‘worm theory’, especially when it is\ncontrasted with stage theory. This is because perduring objects\nstretch out through time just as (we all agree) earthworms stretch out\nthrough space. Worm theory has nothing to do with wormholes, and,\nsadly, people don’t usually describe themselves as ‘worm\ntheorists’. Second: ‘four-dimensionalism’ is\nsometimes used as an umbrella term for perdurance theory and stage\ntheory, and ‘three-dimensionalism’ as a name for endurance\ntheory. This is because perduring objects (and sums of stages) are\nfour-dimensional, whereas enduring objects are three-dimensional,\nwholly present at each moment. But some non-standard views of\npersistence, including ‘mixed’ views, do not fall neatly\ninto either category. And beware: other authors use\n‘four-dimensionalism’ and\n‘three-dimensionalism’ as names for different theories of\ntime, rather than different theories of things in time. Third:\n‘continuant’ is sometimes used as a neutral term for any\nordinary persisting thing. In this sense, we can ask whether\ncontinuants endure or perdure. But the label ‘continuant’\nis more commonly reserved for enduring, three-dimensional objects.\nThis marks a contrast with processes or events, and carries the\nimplication that perdurantists foolishly identify material objects\nwith events. So it tends only to be endurantists who use the term\n‘continuant’. \nSuggested Reading: good introductions to the debate\nabout temporal parts include Loux (1998, chapter 6), Haslanger (2003),\nMcGrath (2007), Sider (2008), Effingham (2009), Balashov (2011),\nEffingham (2012), Goswick (2013), and Curtis and Robson (2016: chapter\n7). Amongst the more recent contributions, Effingham (2009), Goswick,\nand Curtis and Robson are good on the basics; Effingham (2012) is more\ndetailed and comprehensive; Balashov (2011) is more advanced, guided\nby relativistic physics. Lewis (1986a, p. 202) introduces the terms\n‘endurance’ and ‘perdurance’, attributing them\nto Johnston. Sider (1997; 2001, section 3.3) discusses the difficulty\nof defining ‘temporal part’; see also Merricks (1999a),\nHawley (2001, section 1.6) and McKinnon (2002). Wasserman (2016)\nargues that we often conflate the ontological question whether things\nhave temporal parts with the explanatory question whether things\npersist in virtue of having those parts. Donnelly (2016) is a very\nhelpful exploration of different attempts to define endurance –\nin terms of parthood, or location, or grounding. Lewis (1976,\npostscript B) tries to make the notion of a temporal part acceptable\nto endurantists; van Inwagen (2000) and Noonan (2003a) object, whilst\nBraddon-Mitchell and Miller (2004) respond. Perdurantists include\nQuine (1950; 1960), Taylor (1955), Lewis (1971; 1976; 1986a),\nArmstrong (1980), Noonan (1980), Robinson (1982), Heller (1984; 1990),\nLe Poidevin (1991), Jubien (1993), and Hudson (2001). Endurantists\ninclude Thomson (1965; 1983), Geach (1966; 1967), Chisholm (1976),\nMellor (1980; 1981; 1998), Lowe (1983; 1998b), Simons (1987), Forbes\n(1987), Haslanger (1989a), van Inwagen (1990a; 1990b), Oderberg\n(1993), Merricks (1994), Fine (2008/2006), and Shoemaker (2015);\nSimons (2008) responds to Fine. Miller (2005b) defines\n‘endurance’, see also Keinanen and Hakkarainen (2010),\nwhile Janzen (2011) defends endurantism. Melia (2000) eliminates\nprocesses in favour of enduring things. Johnston (1987) explores a\nmixed view, and so, differently, do Hofweber and Velleman (2011),\nGrygianiec (2016), and Brzozowski (2017, 2019). Parsons (2000)\ndevelops four-dimensionalism without temporal parts, and Miller (2009)\ndevelops this further. See also Daniels (2019). Other non-standard\naccounts of persistence include Giordani and Costa (2013), Miller\n(2013), Costa (2017), and Giberman (2019b). For stage theory see Sider\n(1996; 2001) and Hawley (2001); Varzi (2003) is a sympathetic\ndiscussion, whilst Balashov (2007) attempts a precise definition of\n‘exdurance’ aka stage theory. Moyer (2008), Moss (2012)\nand Viebahn (2013) compare stage theory with perdurantism. More on\nstage theory: Stuchlik (2003), Hansson Wahlberg (2008), Wright (2010),\nRychter (2012), McKeever (2017) and Giberman (2019a). Questions about\nhow fine-grained temporal parts or stages must be are discussed by Le\nPoidevin (2000), Stuchlik (2003), Traynor (2013), Effingham (2013),\nMazzola (2015), Kleinschmidt (2017), and Giberman (2019a); Leonard\n(2018) explores endurantism without temporal instants. Cahen (2017)\ndiscusses individuation for temporal parts. \nFor arguments that there is no real dispute here, see McCall and Lowe\n(2003), Lowe and McCall (2004), and Miller (2005); Reydon (2008)\nresponds by drawing analogies with debate about biological species.\nHirsch (2008) shows how more general scepticism about metaphysical\ndisputes might play out here; McGrath (2007) draws out a number of\nconnections with the burgeoning literature on metaontology; see also\nBenovsky (2011), Hansson Wahlberg (2014b), and Giberman (2018). The\nrole of intuitions and ‘folk theory’ in debate about\npersistence is discussed by Rose (2015), Benovsky (2016), and Rose et\nal (2018); the role of experience as evidence is discussed by Prosser\n(2012), Traynor (2014), Prosser (2015) and Young (2018). Scholl (2007)\nconnects the philosophy and psychology of object persistence.\nHawthorne (2006, 2008) explores the distinction between three- and\nfour-dimensionalism (the second of these articles is the more\naccessible). For discussion of how to define ‘wholly\npresent’, see Wasserman (2004a), Crisp and Smith (2005), Olson\n(2006), and Donnelly (2016). Cotnoir’s (2015) review of\nKleinschmidt (2014) highlights issues about persistence and location;\nKleinschmidt’s introduction is very useful,and provides further\nreferences; see also Eagle (2016a). Donnelly (2011) advocates the\nlocation approach, articulated in Parsons (2007); for further\nreferences see the separate entry on\n Location and Mereology,\n especially section 6.3.2. Steward (2015) discusses continuants. The\npresent encyclopedia article focuses on contemporary debate in analytic\nphilosophy; work which makes connections to other times and other\ntraditions includes Hirsch (1999a), Helm (2009), Gorham (2010), Fan\n(2018), McKeever (2018), Costa (2020) and Hayashi (2019). \nEnough about what temporal parts are supposed to be. Why believe in\nthem at all? It’s not clear whether ordinary thinking involves\nany commitment for or against temporal parts: some believe that it is\nneutral, while others believe that the default assumption is that\nthings don’t have temporal parts. Regardless of what ordinary\nthinking tells us, advocates of temporal parts argue that their view\noffers the best solutions to a number of metaphysical problems.\nEndurance theorists respond by offering solutions of their own,\ncriticising the temporal-parts solutions, or both. \nOne metaphysical problem concerns how change is possible (this has\nbecome known as the ‘problem of temporary intrinsics’ or\nsometimes the ‘problem of change’). The banana in the\nfruitbowl was unripe a few days ago, and today it is overripe. Surely\nnothing can be both unripe and overripe?  Of course, it’s\nthe fact that the banana is unripe and overripe at different times\nwhich saves it from metaphysical peril: we all know that. But it would\nbe nice to understand why this fact is crucial: what is it about the\npassage of time which makes it possible for one and the same object to\nhave apparently incompatible properties? \nIf the banana has temporal parts, this explains how it can change: an\nearlier temporal part of the banana is unripe, while a later temporal\npart of the banana is overripe. More grandly: an earlier temporal part\nhas the property being-unripe, while a later temporal part\nhas the property being-ripe. There’s no mystery here,\nany more than there is mystery in your being both hot and cold by\nhaving a hot head and cold feet: we’re all familiar with the\nfact that different parts of the same object can have different\nproperties. \nIs this a good explanation of change? One objection is that\nperdurance-style temporal variation is not really change at all: \nthe whole four-dimensional banana is neither unripe nor overripe, so\ncan’t change between these states, and the temporal parts are\neither permanently unripe or permanently overripe, so they don’t\nchange either. In response, perdurantists distinguish two ways of\ntalking about persisting things – an atemporal way, which takes\nin all times at once, and a temporal way of talking, relative to\nvarious times. On the atemporal way of talking, the whole\nfour-dimensional banana is neither unripe nor overripe; nevertheless,\nit’s true to say in temporal terms that the whole banana is\nunripe on Monday, and the whole banana is overripe on Friday, because\nof the properties of the relevant temporal parts. Endurantists who\nclaim that temporal variation is not genuine change must challenge\nthis combination of temporal and atemporal talk. \nStage theorists give the same basic account of change as perdurantists\ndo, but they have a slightly different response to the no-change\nobjection. According to perdurantists, talk about the same banana at\ndifferent times is straightforwardly made true by one and the same\nfour-dimensional object existing at different times. But some fancy\nfootwork is needed to explain what it is for that object to be\noverripe right now: it’s for it to have an overripe temporal\npart right now. In contrast, according to stage theorists, talk about\nthe banana being overripe right now is straightforwardly made true by\nthe banana being overripe, since the banana just is a momentary stage\nwhich exists right now. But some fancy footwork is needed to explain\nwhat it is for the same banana to exist at different times: it is for\nthe current momentary banana to stand in certain intimate causal\nrelations to momentary bananas in the past and the future. \nTemporal-parts accounts of change seem OK, but can endurantists come\nup with anything equally good or better? How can one and the same\nthing have different properties at different times? One radical answer\nis presentism, the view that only present objects, events and states\nexist: past and future do not exist. Presentism seems to dissolve the\nproblem of change: since only the overripe banana is present, its\nunripe state does not exist, so there’s nothing to worry about.\n(For further discussion of presentism, see\n section 6.) \n But unless there are independent reasons for accepting presentism\n(see the separate entry on\n time),\n it seems like a drastic response to the problem of change. \nLess radically, endurantists may claim that objects change by standing\nin different relations to different times. There is no absolute fact\nof the matter regarding the ripeness of the banana: instead, the\nbanana bears the being-unripe-on relation to Monday, and the\nbeing-overripe-on relation to Friday.  (Alternatively,\nperhaps the banana possesses two compatible properties,\nbeing-unripe-on-Monday, and\nbeing-overripe-on-Friday.) There’s no mystery in an\nobject which bears apparently incompatible relations to different\nthings: you are bigger than the Mona Lisa, and smaller than the\nLouvre, but metaphysicians don’t puzzle over how you can be both\nbigger-than and smaller-than. Those who oppose this relational view of\nchangeable properties claim that it’s just too relational: the\nbanana seems to lose all its intrinsic nature. We may also worry that,\nas with the temporal parts account, it’s not clear whether\nanything really changes on this picture: the banana always stands in\nthe same relations to the various times. \n(For further discussion see the separate entry on\n intrinsic vs. extrinsic properties,\n especially section 1.1.) \nA third endurantist account of change is adverbialism. Change is\npuzzling because it seems that a single object (like the banana) both\nhas and doesn’t have a single property (like\nbeing-unripe). The adverbialist idea is that, instead of\nsubdividing the object into temporal parts (the banana-on-Monday and\nthe banana-on-Friday), or subdividing the property (into\nbeing-unripe-on-Monday and being-unripe-on-Friday),\nwe should subdivide the way in which the object has the property. The\nbanana has the property being-unripe in a Monday way, and it\nfails to have that same property in a Friday way. (Adverbialism is\nso-called because it focuses on ways of having properties: an adverb\ntells you about the way something is done.) Objections to adverbialism\nfocus on whether this relativisation of ways things have (or\n‘instantiate’) properties can explain change without\nsimply raising further problems about the nature of instantiation. \nIn summary, then, those who believe in temporal parts seem to have a\nnice explanation of change to hand. But those who reject temporal\nparts also have a range of options, none of which seems decisively to\nhave been ruled out. (For further discussion, see the separate entries\non\n change\n and on\n singular propositions\n .) \nThere have been a number of challenges to the idea there is any\ngenuinely metaphysical ‘problem of change’; this is\nsometimes diagnosed as a problem arising from confusions about tensed\nlanguage. However, there is no consensus about what the consequence\nwould be if there were no metaphysical problem of change: should we\ndefault to endurance, or to perdurance, or should we conclude that the\ncontrast between these two positions is also somehow illusory?  \nSuggested Reading: It’s a good idea to start\nwith Lewis (1986a, pp. 203–4), who coins the phrase\n‘problem of temporary intrinsics’, argues that none of the\nendurance theories of change are satisfactory, and sets out the\nperdurance account of change. Wasserman (2006) surveys the debate; see\nalso Wasserman (2010). McTaggart (1927, sections 315–6), Simons\n(1987), Mellor (1998, section 8.4), McCall and Lowe (2009), and\nOderberg (2004) argue that variation between temporal parts is not\ngenuine change (Oderberg 2004 is also sceptical as to whether there is\nany genuine puzzle here). For a response see Heller (1992), then\nLombard (1994) in return. Botterell (2004) also criticises the\ntemporal parts account of change; Sattig (2002, 2003) objects to the\nperdurantist and stage accounts of predication; see also Hansson\nWahlberg (2009, 2010), Lombard (2006) and Perovic (2019); Giberman\n(2017) argues against endurantist accounts of change. For the\npresentist account of change, see Merricks (1994), Hinchliff (1996),\nZimmerman (1998a), and Fiocco (2010); Rettler (2012) makes other\nconnections between the metaphysics of persistence and of time. van\nInwagen (1990a) advocates a relations-to-times view of temporary\nproperties, as do Wasserman (2003) and Mellor (1981), although Mellor\n(1998) has a different account, in terms of fact-constituents;\nEffingham and Melia (2007) defend the view against objections from\nSider (2001). For discussion of Lewis’s objection to the\nrelations-to-times view, see MacBride (2001) and Rodriguez-Pereyra\n(2003); for a related objection see Browning (1988). Rychter (2008)\ndiscusses what it is to have a property atemporally. Lowe (1987),\nJohnston (1987) and Haslanger (1989b) all propose versions of\nadverbialism. For discussion of these, see Lewis (1988; 2002), Lowe\n(1988b) and Lombard (2003). Miller and Braddon-Mitchell (2007) defend\nboth adverbialism and relations-to-times against objections; see also\nBottani (2016). Rea (1998b) argues that consideration of change does\nnot favour perdurantism. For stage theory see Sider (2000; 2001,\nsection 4.6). Hawley (2001, chapter 1) also advocates stage theory,\nand discusses most of the issues covered in this section. Alternative\naccounts of change are mooted by Ehring (1997; 2001), Simons (2000a),\nMacBride (2001), Parsons (2001), and Brower (2010). Klein (1999)\nargues that neither endurance nor perdurance theories permit genuine\nchange; see also Meincke (2019). In various ways, Rychter (2009),\nHansson (2007), and Hofweber (2009) argue that there is no genuine\nproblem of change; Raven (2011) argues that there is, whilst Einheuser\n(2012) gives a nuanced assessment. Eddon (2010a) argues that the\nproblem cannot give us purchase on which theory of persistence to\nadopt. \nWe usually assume that two different things can’t be in the same\nplace at the same time: how could there be room? But certain puzzle\ncases challenge this assumption. These puzzles are of interest in\ntheir own right, but they feature in this article because, as with the\nproblem of change, perdurantists have argued that believing in\ntemporal parts is the best way to solve the puzzles. And, as with the\nproblem of change, endurantists may reply that temporal parts\ndon’t help, or that there is a perfectly good endurantist\nalternative, or both. \nIn some puzzle cases it seems that two objects occupy the same place\nat the same time, but not forever: one or both of them exist either\nbefore or after the period of coincidence. For example, suppose you\ntake a lump of clay, and by moulding and shaping it create a statue,\nwhich you place proudly on a plinth. What’s on the plinth? Well,\nthe statue is. Is the original lump of clay also on the plinth? It\nseems so: you didn’t destroy or even damage the lump of clay\njust by changing its shape. So are there are two statue-shaped things\non the plinth, a statue and a lump of clay? On the one hand it seems\ndaft to count these as two different objects. But on the other hand\nthey do seem different: the lump of clay is older than the statue, for\nexample, and perhaps it makes sense to describe the statue as\n‘well-made’ or as ‘yet another derivative bit of\nart-as-therapy’, while the lump of clay is neither well-made nor\nderivative: it was just dug out of the garden. These differences\nsuggest that the lump of clay and the statue are two different things,\noccupying the same place at the same time. \nThis argument is sometimes expressed using Leibniz’s Law, the\nprinciple which says that if objects differ in their properties, they\ncannot be one and the same thing. Leibniz’s Law should be\ndistinguished from the more controversial Principle of the Identity of\nIndiscernibles, which says that if objects share all their properties,\nthey must be one and the same thing. (See the separate entry on the\n identity of indiscernibles.) \nSimilar examples of temporary coincidence can arise when objects gain\nor lose parts. Tibbles the cat is made of the usual catty parts,\nincluding a tail, and a tail-complement, i.e., all of Tibbles except\nfor her tail. A tail-complement is a slightly strange object, but\nit’s rather like a torso, i.e., all of an animal except for its\nlimbs and head. Tibbles has a whimsical owner, who names the\ntail-complement ‘Tib’. One eventful day, Tibbles loses her\ntail in an accident: she shrinks to become exactly the same size and\nshape as Tib. On the one hand it seems daft to count Tibbles and Tib\nas two different objects after the accident. But on the other hand\nthey do seem different: Tibbles has been a cat for years, unlike Tib,\nand Tibbles is her owner’s favourite animal, while perhaps we\ncannot say this of Tib. These differences suggest that, after the\naccident, Tibbles and Tib are two different things occupying the same\nplace at the same time. \n(Related problems about cats and their parts are dealt with in the\nseparate entry on the\n problem of the many.) \nWhat have these puzzles about temporary coincidence got to do with\ntemporal parts? If we accept that statues, lumps of clay, cats, tails\nand tail-complements all have temporal parts, then we can tell a\ncoherent story about these cases. This should tempt us to believe in\ntemporal parts, unless endurantists can come up with a good story of\ntheir own. Let’s look at the perdurantist and endurantist\nstories in turn. \nCentral to the perdurantist account of temporary coincidence is the\nclaim that, while it is bizarre to think that two distinct objects\ncould entirely coincide, there is nothing bizarre about two objects\npartially coinciding by sharing a part, and nothing bizarre about an\nobject partially coinciding with one of its own parts. Recall the\nexample of you and your conjoined twin. If you share a hand, there is\nno puzzle about how you can both be in the same glove without jostling\nfor space: you and your twin partially coincide by sharing a part. And\nthink of your left foot: there is no mystery about how you and your\nfoot can both be in the same sock, nor about how you can be partially\nin the same place as your own foot. According to perdurantists, cases\nof temporary coincidence involve objects which partially overlap by\nsharing temporal parts, or objects which partially overlap because one\nis a temporal part of the other (we can think of this as a limiting\ncase of sharing parts). \nThink of the lump of clay and the statue. Suppose you formed the lump\nout of smaller bits on Monday, made it into a statue on Wednesday,\nthen smashed the thing to pieces on Sunday. According to\nperdurantists, the lump of clay is a week-long four-dimensional\nobject, and the statue is a five-day-long four-dimensional object.\nIndeed, the statue is a temporal part of the lump of clay, composed of\nsome of the instantaneous temporal parts which compose the lump. Now,\nhow many statue-shaped things are on the plinth on Thursday? Well, the\nlump of clay and the statue both have a temporal part sitting on the\nplinth on Thursday, so they’re both partially on the plinth on\nThursday. But neither the lump nor the statue is wholly there on the\nplinth on Thursday. This explains both our intuition that\nthere’s only one object there (there’s just the one\narty-looking temporal part at any given moment) and our intuition that\nthe statue and the lump are different objects with different\nproperties (they occupy different four-dimensional regions). \nMuch the same can be said for Tib and Tibbles. Tib and Tibbles are\nboth long-lasting four-dimensional objects, according to\nperdurantists. Before the accident, at any given moment a temporal\npart of Tib is a spatial part of a temporal part of Tibbles. After the\naccident, Tib and Tibbles share temporal parts. But there’s no\nmystery as to how Tib and Tibbles can coincide after the accident yet\nstill be different things: neither the whole Tib nor the whole Tibbles\nis there, just some of their shared temporal parts. \nObjections to the perdurance account of temporary coincidence focus on\nmore general (alleged) difficulties for perdurantism; on whether the\naccount can generalise to cope with all coincidence problems (see\n section 4.2);\n and on whether it can explain why we are happy to call the statue but\nnot the lump ‘well-made’ or ‘derivative’.\nThere are also specific objections to the perdurance account of cases\nof temporary coincidence which involve people (see\n section 9\n for these). What can endurantists come up with instead? \nOne popular endurantist option is simply to accept that two different\nobjects can wholly occupy exactly the same location at the same time.\nThis view is sometimes called the ‘standard account’ of\ncoincidence. The relationship between wholly-coinciding objects is\noften called ‘constitution’, and so the slogan of the\nstandard account is ‘constitution is not identity’. The\nlump of clay constitutes the statue, so they do not have to jostle for\nspace, but they are distinct objects, so they can differ in their age,\nin whether they are derivative, and so on. (Beware: the\nsimilar-sounding ‘composition is not identity’ usually\nrepresents the quite different view that a whole is not identical to\nits several parts.) \nThe examples we have seen so far involve coincidence between objects\nof different kinds: a cat and a tail-complement, a statue and a lump\nof clay. According to some versions of the standard account,\nconstitution is always a one-way relationship: the lump constitutes\nthe statue, but not vice versa. Accounts without this restriction can\nbe sympathetic to coincidence between objects of the same kind. This\nmay occur, for example, if objects of the same kind can\n‘merge’ without losing their identity, or if what looks\nlike a single object can ‘divide’ into two of the same\nkind (some versions of the ‘ship of Theseus’ problem have\nthis form). The most intriguing imagined cases of fusion and fission\ninvolve people, and will be discussed briefly in\n section 9.\n (The claim that same-kind coincidence is impossible is sometimes\ncalled ‘Locke’s thesis’.) \nOpponents of the standard account make the following objections: it\nrequires just too many objects (a particular problem in vague cases,\nsee\n section 5);\n it entails that when a 1kg statue is constituted by a distinct 1kg\nlump, the result ought to weigh 2kg; and, most seriously, it fails to\nexplain how two distinct objects, made of the same parts and matter,\narranged in the same way and at the same place and time, can be\ndistinct objects with different properties. How could all these facts\nabout the arrangement of parts fail to fix the facts about the\nwhole? \nDefenders of the standard account make various responses. \nRegarding the ‘too many objects’ accusation, some point\nout that perdurantists require even more objects when you count up all\nthe temporal parts, some attempt to establish principled limits on how\nmany objects are required, and others simply accept the\nmultitude.  After all, it’s not so bad having all those\nobjects when you realise they don’t all need separate locations.\nThe response to the objection about mass turns on an analogy with\nordinary parts and wholes: your various internal organs and limbs\nweigh several kilos each, but we wouldn’t expect these to show\nup on the scales in addition to your total body mass, since you are\nmade of the same stuff as your organs and limbs. Likewise, supposedly,\nalthough the lump and the statue are distinct 1kg objects, we\nshouldn’t expect these to show up separately on the scales,\nsince they are made of the same stuff. \nExplanations of how coinciding objects can have different properties\nvary with different versions of the standard account. Some claim that\ncoinciding objects share all their parts (and are parts of one\nanother). Others claim that, for example, the arm of the statue is not\npart of the lump of clay, although there may be an arm-shaped lump of\nclay which constitutes the statue-arm and is part of the bigger lump\nof clay. But a couple of themes recur in defences of the standard\naccount: first, there is an attempt to shift the burden of proof. Why\nexpect all the properties of a composite object to be\ndetermined by the identity, properties and interrelations of its\npresent parts? Second, there is the point that, although the standard\naccount entails that objects made of the same parts may differ, there\nis no arbitrariness here. Not every object made of suitably-arranged\nparticles of clay is a lump of clay, for some are statues, but\nwhenever there are suitably-arranged particles of clay, there is a\nlump of clay. \nThose who find these explanations unsatisfactory and thereby reject\nthe standard account needn’t become perdurantists, however, for\nthere are several less-popular endurantist accounts of temporary\ncoincidence. Perhaps identity can be temporary: the statue and the\nlump are identical once the statue exists, although the lump was not\nalways identical to the statue; Tib and Tibbles begin as\nnon-identical, and become identical. This proposal requires us to\nchange our views of identity, and of the connection between identity\nand sharing of properties. Or perhaps objects can be destroyed more\neasily than we had realised: the lump of clay ceases to exist when the\nstatue is created (it is replaced by a new, statue-shaped lump of\nclay, made from the same clay particles); the cat’s\ntail-complement ceases to exist when it is separated from the\ntail. \nOr perhaps we should be more restrictive about the kinds of object we\naccept into our ontology. After all, a tail-complement seemed like a\ndubious object from the beginning, and if there is no such thing as\nTib, we don’t have to explain what relationship holds between\nTib and Tibbles (we may grandly deny that cats have ‘arbitrary\nundetached parts’). Similarly, perhaps it is a mistake to think\nthat there literally are such things as statues and lumps of clay, as\nopposed to mere quantities of stuff or pluralities of particles.\nRestrictive ontologies come in different strengths: accepting only\npartless objects and living organisms; accepting only partless objects\nand those composite objects which are ‘greater than the sum of\ntheir parts’; accepting only partless objects; accepting only\n‘stuff’ or matter and not objects at all; accepting only\n‘proper’ objects and not quantities of stuff. \nDifficulties here include reconciling such radical claims with our\neveryday beliefs, and, for the more moderate versions, ensuring that\neach and every possible case of coincidence really has been ruled\nout. \nFurther discussion of these and other options can be found in the\nseparate entry on\n relative identity. \nThe cases discussed so far involve objects which seem to coincide for\na while, yet fail to coincide at other times at which at least one of\nthem exists. Perdurantists claim that temporarily-coincident objects\nare not wholly coincident: their non-coincident parts lie in the past\nor future. But other puzzle cases seem to involve\npermanently-coincident objects: even perdurantists have to accept that\npermanently-coinciding objects wholly coincide. \nSuppose that, instead of first forming or digging up the lump of clay\nthen later moulding it into a statue, you make the two halves of the\nstatue separately, then create both statue and large lump in one fell\nswoop, by sticking the halves together. Later, you petulantly smash\nthe thing into pieces, destroying statue and lump simultaneously.\nHere, it seems that the lump of clay and the statue coincide at every\nmoment at which either exists, yet they seem to be distinct objects\nbecause they differ in how they could have been: for example, the\nstatue could have been made of a different lump of clay, but the lump\ncould not. Talk of temporal parts doesn’t help here: lump and\nstatue share all their temporal parts, and differ only in their modal\nfeatures (in how they could have been different). \nCan perdurantists accept that the lump and statue are distinct,\ncoinciding objects? In principle, yes, but this would be strategically\nunwise: accepting the possibility of complete coincidence without\nidentity leaves perdurantism with no advantage over the standard\nendurantist account of coincidence. Perdurantists are better advised\nto claim that the statue and the lump of clay are one and the same\nobject, then come up with some explanation of why they appear to have\ndifferent properties. We may say that the object in question could,\nqua statue, have been made out of a different lump of clay,\nbut could not, qua lump, have been made out of a different\nlump of clay. There are various ways of explaining what the\n‘qua’ clauses are doing in this peculiar claim,\nand perhaps the most popular explanation involves counterpart theory,\na controversial theory about our talk of possibilities. Objections\nhere turn either on problems for counterpart theory, or else on\nwhether a satisfactory theory of how we talk about actual things can\never be compatible with this view. \nEndurantists are in a happier position regarding permanent\ncoincidence: whatever solution they have adopted in response to\ntemporary coincidence will also handle permanent coincidence (although\nadjustments are necessary in some cases). \nSuggested reading: This is a large field, but Rea\n(1995) provides a helpful overview, and the papers collected in Rea\n(ed.) (1997) are a useful next step. Sider (2001, chapter 5) and\nHawley (2001, chapters 5 and 6) also survey this area, both from a\ntemporal-parts perspective. Korman (2015: chapter 11) and Sattig\n(2015: chapters 3 and 5) provide more up-to-date entry points to the\ndebate. The standard account is advocated or discussed sympathetically\nby Doepke (1982), Baker (1997), Fine (2000; 2003), Johnston (1992),\nRobinson (1985), Levey (1997), Lowe (1983; 1997; 2003), Moyer (2006),\nOderberg (1996), Rea (1997), Simons (1985; 1986; 1987; 1997), Yablo\n(1987), Thomson (1983; 1998), Paul (2006) and Wasserman (2002);\ncritics include Olson (1997), Heller (2000), Hughes (1997a; 1997b),\nLewis (1971), Noonan (1993) and Burke (1992). Gilmore (2007) argues\nthat endurance theorists can handle coincidence by paying attention to\nthe appropriate notion of spatiotemporal location; Eagle (2010a)\ncriticises this argument, and Gilmore (2010) responds, followed by\nEagle (2010b). McGrath (2007a) argues that temporal parts views suffer\nthe same difficulties as the standard account; Hawley (2008) discusses\nthis further, whilst Hawley (2005) explores related issues; see also\nDonnelly (2016). Moyer (2009) argues that coincidence is neutral\nbetween endurance and perdurance; in response, Eddon (2010) defends\nperdurance; Rychter (2011) also defends perdurance here. Sattig (2008)\nargues that perdurantists cannot combine coincidence with informative\nidentity criteria. Temporary identity is advocated by Baxter (1989)\nand Gallois (1990; 1998). The claim that objects can be very easily\ndestroyed is advocated by Burke (1994a; 1994b; 1997a; 1997b) and Rea\n(2000), and critically discussed by Carter (1997), Denkel (1995), Lowe\n(1995b), Noonan (1999b), Olson (1997a), Zimmerman (1997) and Zammiello\n(2001). Restrictive ontologies are discussed by Chisholm (1973), Elder\n(1999), Merricks (2000; 2001), Olson (1996; 1997b), van Inwagen (1981;\n1990b), and Zimmerman (1997; 1995); Sidelle (1998) explores a number\nof interesting options, as does Needham (2010). Walters (2019) draws\nconnections with debates in mereology. It’s hard to avoid\nWiggins (1980; 2001). The classic discussion of permanent coincidence\nis Gibbard (1975). Temporal-parts accounts of permanent coincidence\ninclude Noonan (1988; 1993; 1999a). Counterpart theory is advocated by\nLewis (1986, chapter 4). Magidor (2016) argues that the arguments\ndiscussed in this section cannot settle the endurance-perdurance\ndebate. A more formal approach to problems concerning change of parts\ncan be found in the separate entry on\n mereology,\n especially in section 3.2; further discussion can also be found in\nthe separate entries on\n material constitution,\n on\n relative identity\n and on\n ordinary objects. \n(The so-called ‘argument from vagueness’, sometimes\ninvoked in support of temporal parts, is discussed in\n Section 8\n below.) \nVagueness, or indeterminacy, seems to be a feature of our everyday\nexperience of persisting things, and it creates problems which,\naccording to temporal parts theorists, can best be solved by accepting\nthat things have temporal parts. As with the problems of change and of\ncoincidence, endurantists may criticise the temporal parts solution to\nthis problem, provide solutions of their own, or both. \nVagueness often occurs at the beginning and ending of existence. It is\nnotoriously controversial whether there is a precise moment at which\nhuman people begin to exist, and if so when that moment is. But most\nof us will have a grey area at the end of our existence, a few\nseconds, a few minutes, or even longer during which we seem to be\nneither clearly alive nor clearly dead. More mundanely, formation and\ndecay are gradual processes for many kinds of object, both natural and\nartificial: think of a lake or haystack which gradually comes into\nexistence, or a building or a rock formation which slowly crumbles\naway. Let’s call this phenomenon ‘fuzzy temporal\nboundaries’. \nIndeterminacy can also arise when objects intermingle in a way which\nseems to leave it clear that they survive the process, but unclear\nwhich object is which. Suppose you remove about half the parts from\nthe bicycle your uncle gave you, about half the parts from the bicycle\nyour aunt gave you, and switch them over. Afterwards, you have two\nbicycles, each half-made of parts that used to be in the bicycle your\nuncle gave you, and half-made of parts that used to be in the bicycle\nyour aunt gave you. Which post-repair bicycle is the one your uncle\ngave you, and which the one your aunt gave you? There seems to be no\nclear fact of the matter. Let’s call this phenomenon\n‘radical disruption’. \nIn their bare essentials, the two types of indeterminacy are the same\n(and it is possible to construct cases of intermediate types). In each\ncase, we are not sure how to pin down the career of an object. In\nfuzzy-boundary cases, we don’t know which of many overlapping\ncareer paths an object follows (one which begins earlier, or later?);\nin radical disruption cases, we don’t know which of (at least)\ntwo intersecting career paths an object follows. \nTypical temporal parts theorists argue that such indeterminacy results\nfrom a mismatch between human language and temporarily-coincident\nobjects (of the sort discussed in\n section 4.1).\n Take a building which slowly crumbles away to nothing. According to\nmost temporal parts theorists, there are very many\n‘nested’ four-dimensional objects involved in this\nprocess, some of which end before others do. We are unclear about when\nthe building ceases to exist because our use of language just\ndoesn’t determine which of these many four-dimensional objects\nis ‘the building’. \nLikewise, in radical disruption cases like that of the bicycles,\nperdurantists typically recognise a number of different\ntemporarily-coincident four-dimensional objects. Suppose the bicycle\nyour uncle gave you starts off made of parts A and parts\nB, and the bicycle your aunt gave you starts off made of parts\nC and parts D. After the switch-around, you have a\nbicycle made of parts A and parts C, and a bicycle made\nof parts B and parts D. Perdurantists recognise (at\nleast) the following four-dimensional objects: \nBefore the switch-around, objects (1) and (2) temporarily coincide, in\nthe place where you keep the bicycle your uncle gave you, and objects\n(3) and (4) temporarily coincide, in the place where you keep the\nbicycle your aunt gave you. After the switch-around, objects (1) and\n(3) coincide, and objects (2) and (4) coincide. When we initially\ntalked about ‘the bicycle your uncle gave you’, there was\nno fact of the matter as to whether we were talking about (1) or (2).\nAnd (1) and (2) end up in different places after the switch-around,\nwhich is why we don’t know what to say about the final location\nof the bicycle your uncle gave you. \nFrom a typical perdurantist perspective, apparent indeterminacy in\npersistence arises from our fumbling failures to deal with the\nmultitude of precise four-dimensional objects around us. This account\nof indeterminacy is not a consequence of perdurance theory alone: as\nwell as the claim that ordinary things have temporal parts, it\ninvolves the claim that there are many more persisting things than we\nrecognise in ordinary life. It is possible to believe in temporal\nparts without accepting this second claim but, as we will see in\n section 8,\n most perdurantists do accept the second claim. The typical\nperdurantist story also involves a theory of vagueness which traces it\nto our use of language; it is not compulsory for perdurantists to\nthink about vagueness in this way, but many do adopt this\n‘linguistic’ or ‘semantic’ approach to\nvagueness. \nObjections to the typical temporal parts account of indeterminacy in\npersistence turn on the sheer number of temporarily coincident objects\nrequired to make the story work; or on independent objections to the\nlanguage-based account of vagueness (see the separate entry on\n vagueness);\n or on particular objections to telling such a story about\nindeterminacy involving people (see\n section 9). \nWhat can endurantists say about indeterminacy in persistence? \nOne option is to mimic the perdurantist temporary-coincidence account,\nbut without the temporal parts. That’s to say, endurantists\ncould claim that there are very many wholly-present coincident\nbuilding-like objects where the building stands, each of which ends at\na slightly different moment from all the others. This multiplicity,\ntogether with our loose talk, accounts for the unclarity in when the\nbuilding ceases to exist. Likewise, endurantists could recognise\nobjects (1)–(4), just as perdurantists do, but claim that each\nis wholly present whenever it exists. This strategy is unpopular,\nbecause temporarily-coincident enduring objects can seem worse than\ntemporarily-coincident perduring objects: temporarily-coincident\nendurers are wholly coincident, unlike temporarily-coincident\nperdurers. Endurantists may want to recognise some temporarily\ncoinciding things (see\n section 4.1),\n yet stop short of the multitudes which would be required to explain\nfuzzy boundaries. \nA second endurantist option is to accept that sometimes there just are\nno precise facts of the matter about the temporal boundaries and\ncareers of objects, because the world itself is sometimes\nindeterminate. This is the claim that there can be worldly\n(‘ontic’, or ‘metaphysical’) vagueness. (A\nworldly-vagueness option is also available to perdurantists, and might\nbe attractive to those who want to avoid commitment to a multitude of\ntemporarily-coincident four-dimensional objects. But typical\nperdurantists adopt the\ntemporary-coincidence-plus-linguistic-vagueness account outlined\nabove.) \nMany people recoil at the thought that the world itself could be vague\nor indeterminate, perhaps because they believe that indeterminacy must\nbe a result of mismatch between what is represented (the world), and\nwhat does the representing (thought or language). Even those who\ndon’t mind a bit of worldly vagueness may have reason to reject\nworldly vagueness in persistence, because this amounts to worldly\nvagueness in identity: it’s vague whether the original bicycle\nyour uncle gave you is identical with the bicycle you now ride to\nwork. Worldly vagueness in identity is thought to be especially\nproblematic, because all identity is self-identity, and it’s\nhard to see how there could be any vagueness in self-identity. \nThird, endurantists could claim that we speak precisely, that there\nalways are determinate facts of the matter about the identity,\nexistence and careers of objects, but it’s just that sometimes\nwe can’t tell what these facts are. (This involves an\n‘epistemicist’ account of vagueness.) This claim could be\ndeveloped in one of two ways. In the case of the crumbling building,\nfor example, endurantists could claim that there is a single\nbuilding-shaped object with an unknown final moment. Or they could\nclaim that there are very many temporarily-coincident building-like\nobjects, each with a different final moment, that we refer to just one\nof these when we say ‘the building’ but we do not know\nwhich. (Again, perdurantists may adopt one of these epistemicist\nstrategies, but typically do not.) \nObjections here may turn on problems for the epistemicist view of\nvagueness in general; on the oddity of insisting that, for example,\nthere is an exact number of molecules which a building can lose before\nit stops existing (on the first version of the view); or on objections\nto multitudinous temporary coincidents (on the second version of the\nview). \nFinally, endurantists could adopt a restricted ontology, as some do in\nresponse to temporary coincidence. If there aren’t really any\nsuch things as bicycles, buildings or lakes, just particles moving\naround and interacting, then there are no issues to resolve about the\ncareers and identities of bicycles, buildings or lakes. As before, the\nmain difficulty here is in reconciling our everyday beliefs with a\nsufficiently restricted ontology: after all, people and even\nfundamental particles seem sometimes to be indeterminate. (Again, it\nis open to perdurantists to adopt a restricted ontology, but typically\nthey do not.) \nIn summary then, both perdurantists and endurantists can adopt various\nresponses to apparent vagueness in persistence; which they choose\ndepends in part upon their more general views about the nature of\nvagueness. Typical perdurantists posit temporary coincidence between\nobjects, and a failure on our part to talk determinately about any one\nof these. Endurantists could make the same claim, but typically do\nnot. A temporary-coincidence view could instead be paired with an\nepistemic account of vagueness, and our failure to know which object\nwe’re talking about. Alternatively, vagueness may be either\nattributed to objects themselves, and their failure to have\ndeterminate careers, or else to our failure to know what careers they\nhave. A radical option is to deny that any genuine object is involved\n(thus restricting ontology). In different ways, all of these options\nare available to perdurantists and endurantists alike, but the costs\nand benefits differ. \nSuggested Reading: For a way into the general debate\nabout vagueness, try Keefe and Smith (eds.) (1997), and the separate\nentry on\n vagueness.\n Stalnaker (1988) is a particularly nice discussion of vague\npersistence.  Issues discussed in this section are covered in\nmore detail by Hawley (2001, chapter 4). Temporal parts accounts of\nvague persistence are defended by Sider (2001, section 4.9) (Sider\npresents a distinctive argument which will be discussed in\n section 8)\n and Heller (2000); these are criticised by Lowe (2005). Romerales\n(2008) compares perdurance and stage theory on this front. Endurantist\nworldly vagueness is defended by van Inwagen (1988; 1990b) and\ndiscussed by Cowles (1994), Garrett (1991), and Hirsch (1999). The\nclassic argument against worldly vagueness in identity can be found in\nEvans (1978) and Salmon (1981). Heller (1996) objects to worldly\nvagueness of all kinds. Hudson (2000) defends an epistemicist temporal\nparts theory. Williamson (1994, chapter 9) discusses an epistemicist\naccount of vague objects. Haslanger (1994) considers multitudes of\ncoinciding endurers, and Sosa (1987; 1999) looks kindly upon the idea,\nas does Kurtsal Steen (2010). Further discussion can also be found in\nthe separate entries on\n ordinary objects\n and on\n identity.\n  \nAs well as disagreeing about whether persisting things have temporal\nparts, philosophers disagree about the nature of time itself. Does\ntime flow? Are the past and the future as real as the present?\nPhilosophers also disagree about the connection between these\ndisagreements: does taking a certain view about the nature of time\ncommit you to any particular view about the existence of temporal\nparts? What about vice versa? \nYou can find a more detailed discussion of the nature of time\nelsewhere in this encyclopedia (see the separate entry on\n time).\n The most relevant debate for our purposes turns on whether distant\ntimes are like distant places. For example, people, objects and places\nin Antarctica exist, even though they are far away (if you are reading\nthis in Antarctica, please adjust the example). It can be difficult to\ncommunicate with distant places, and they may be less important to us\nthan our immediate surroundings, but they exist nevertheless. What\nabout eighteenth-century people, objects and times? Does David Hume\nexist, despite being far away in time? Or is it more reasonable to say\nthat Hume used to exist, but now does not exist?  Eternalists\nbelieve that past and future things exist, just like present things.\nPresentists, in contrast, believe that distant times are not like\ndistant places: things in distant places exist, but things at distant\ntimes do not. According to the intermediate ‘growing\nuniverse’ theory, past and present things exist, but future\nthings do not. \nWhat connection is there between the eternalism-presentism debate, and\nthe debate about temporal parts? It’s natural to suppose that\npresentists should be endurantists, claiming that things are wholly\npresent whenever they exist. If you don’t believe in either the\npast or the future, there’s nowhere and nowhen for any\n‘missing’ parts to be. This argument from presentism to\nendurantism needs some work, however. Presentists think that only the\npresent exists, but they’re happy for us to talk about the\ncauses of the First World War, about next week’s seminar, or\nabout David Hume. Although Hume does not exist, it’s right to\nsay that David Hume wrote An Enquiry Concerning Human\nUnderstanding, and wrong to say that David Hume wrote The\nFeminine Mystique. Presentists worth their salt provide a story\nabout what makes certain statements about the past and the future\nright, and others wrong. Can presentists claim that, although past and\nfuture temporal parts of the banana do not exist, the banana did have\ntemporal parts in the past, and will have other temporal parts in the\nfuture? This takes us back to the question of how to define\n‘temporal part’ (see\n section 2),\n and it raises a methodological issue: should ‘temporal\npart’ be defined in such a way that presentists can believe in\ntemporal parts, or not? \nWell, perhaps presentists should reject temporal parts and so be\nendurantists. Must eternalists, who believe in the past and the\nfuture, accept temporal parts and so be perdurantists? Or are\neternalists free to choose between endurantism and perdurantism? \nOne reason to think that eternalists should believe in temporal parts\nis that without them they may have difficulty explaining how things\nchange. How can you both know about theories of persistence (tomorrow)\nand fail to know about theories of persistence (yesterday)?\nPresentists don’t seem to have a problem here: your failure\nyesterday to know about theories of persistence just doesn’t\nexist. But eternalists are committed to the existence of your two\napparently-conflicting states. If eternalists accept temporal parts,\nthey have a neat explanation at hand: your yesterday temporal part\ndoesn’t know about theories of persistence, but your tomorrow\npart does know about theories of persistence. But if eternalists\nreject temporal parts, then the two apparently-conflicting states are\nstates of one and the same thing (you), and it’s not obvious how\nto resolve the conflict. So perhaps eternalists should believe in\ntemporal parts, and, conversely, those who reject temporal parts\nshould be presentists. This argument succeeds only if eternalists\nreally can’t explain change without believing in temporal parts\n(see\n section 3). \nIf we could establish that things have temporal parts if and only if\nthe past and the future exist, this would raise a number of issues.\nFirst, should we attempt to establish a theory of persistence, and\nthen let this dictate our theory of time? Or should we start with the\ntheory of time? (See\n section 7\n for an argument from physics against presentism and thus, perhaps,\nagainst endurantism.) Or can we somehow establish both at once?\nSecond, tying the dispute about persistence to the dispute about time\nmakes trouble for anyone who thinks that one of the disputes is\ngenuine but the other is merely a verbal disagreement. And, third,\nsince presentism and eternalism seem clearly to be incompatible, if\neach compels a different account of persistence, then there\ncan’t be ‘mixed’ worlds in which some things perdure\nand others endure (a peculiar consequence, since most endurantists\nthink that processes perdure). \nAttempts to connect debates about time with debates about persistence\nhave focused on the disagreement between eternalists and presentists.\nBut there is another dispute about time which may have some bearing on\nwhether things have temporal parts. Eternalists agree that past,\npresent and future times all exist, but they disagree amongst\nthemselves as to whether there are important ontological differences\nbetween the three categories. Advocates of the ‘A-theory’\nof time argue that the flow of time pushes events from one ontological\nstatus to another (presentists are usually taken to be A-theorists\ntoo). But advocates of the ‘B-theory’ of time think that\nthere is no important ontological difference between past, present and\nfuture, and that there is no such thing as ‘the flow of\ntime’. There is some tendency to think that the A-theory is more\nhospitable to endurantism, and the B-theory more hospitable to\nperdurantism, but there is no consensus on this matter. \nFinally, considerations about the possibility of time-travel have been\nused to argue both for and against the existence of temporal parts;\nthese arguments connect with debate about whether we should approach\npersistence as an issue about parthood and/or as an issue about\nlocation. For more on this debate, see section 4.2 of the separate\nentry on\n Time Travel,\n and section 6.3.5 of the separate entry on\n Location and Mereology. \nSuggested Reading: Earlier discussions of temporal\nparts paid close attention to analogies and disanalogies between space\nand time: e.g. Taylor (1955), Meiland (1966); Butterfield (1985)\nreflects on these. Lombard (1999) and Brogaard (2000) argue that\npresentism is compatible with perdurantism, while Merricks (1995) and\nHestevold and Carter (2002) argue that presentism compels endurantism.\nBenovsky (2009) takes an even-handed approach. Merricks (1995) and\nHinchliff (1996) argue that eternalism rules out endurantism, because\nof the problem of change; see the suggested reading at the end of\n section 3\n for endurance-friendly eternalist accounts of change. Lowe (1998a)\nargues for a connection between theories of time and theories of\npersistence. Markosian (1994) attempts to formulate the\nendurance-perdurance debate in a way which is independent of the\neternalism/presentism debate. Mellor (1981; 1998) and Johnston (1987)\ncombine eternalism and endurantism, whilst Ingthorsson (2009) opposes\nthis combination, and Pezet (2019) favours endurance with presentism.\nTallant (2018) argues that presentism is incompatible with each of\nperdurantism, endurantism, and stage theory; responses include Baron\n(2019), Noonan (2019), Iaquinto (2019), and Hochstetter and Hess\n(2020). For discussion of the relationship between the A/B-theory\ndebate and the debate about persistence, see Butterfield (1985),\nOaklander (1992), Wilson (1955), and Carter and Hestevold (1994).\nParsons (2005) highlights a semantic problem for B-theory\nperdurantists. Barker and Dowe (2003) criticise endurantism by drawing\non rival theories of time; McDaniel (2003) and Beebee and Rush (2003)\nrespond, provoking Barker and Dowe (2005); see also Benovsky (2009a).\nFollowing Sider (2001), Effingham and Robson (2007) argue that\nendurantism cannot account for the possibility of time travel, as does\nSimon (2005), whilst Miller (2006a) defends endurantism; Gilmore\n(2007) and Effingham (2011a) argue that time travel is a problem for\nperdurantism. See also Effingham (2010) and Daniels (2014). Wasserman\n(2017: chapter 6) sets this discussion in the context of wider debates\nabout time travel; Proetti and Smid (2019) are sceptical about time\ntravel arguments here. See also Mooney (2019a, 2019b), Valaris and\nMichael (2015). Gilmore et al (2016) consider other connections\nbetween the metaphysics of time and debates about persistence. \nDidn’t Einstein show that space and time are basically the same\nthing? It’s true that Einstein’s two theories of\nrelativity radically altered our scientific picture of space and time,\nalthough it is more controversial what consequences the theories have\nfor metaphysics. (See section 3 of the separate entry on\n being and becoming in modern physics\n for more detail on this issue.) It is the Special Theory of\nRelativity (STR) which has had most impact on the debate about\ntemporal parts: three quite different arguments have been proposed,\neach of which purports to show that STR lends support to the\nperdurantist claim that things have temporal parts. \nFor our purposes, the key feature of STR is its claim that, for many\npairs of events, there is no absolute fact of the matter as to which\nevent, if either, happened first, or whether both occurred at the same\ntime. The question of precedence has different answers according to\ndifferent frames of reference, and there are no grounds for selecting\nany single frame of reference as the one which gives the\n‘real’ answer. This means that, for many events, there is\nno absolute fact of the matter as to whether they are occurring in the\npresent, in the past or in the future. (If they were occurring now,\nthey’d be occurring simultaneously with your reading this\nsentence, but there’s no absolute fact of the matter about this\nsimultaneity issue.) \nA first argument from STR to perdurantism goes as follows: STR shows\nspace to be much like time, objects extend in space by having spatial\nparts, so objects persist through time by having temporal parts. \nBut this argument is weak: although STR does show space to be like\ntime in some respects, the theory does still differentiate between\nspatial and temporal dimensions. Even if it did not, we would need\nsome further reason to believe that persistence must be just like\nspatial extension. \nA second argument from STR to perdurantism proceeds via the debate\nabout time (see\n section 6).\n According to STR, for many events there is no absolute fact of the\nmatter as to whether those events are simultaneous with now.\nThat’s to say, at any moment, there is no absolute fact of the\nmatter as to which events are present. This makes life difficult for\npresentists, who claim that only present events exist. If STR thereby\nrules out presentism, and if endurantism requires presentism in order\nto explain change (see\n section 3),\n then STR rules out endurantism: things have temporal parts. But not\nall endurantists agree that they must be presentists, and not all\npresentists agree that their view is undermined by STR. \nA third argument from STR to perdurantism does not rely on the claim\nthat STR is out-and-out incompatible with endurantism. Instead, the\nclaim is that STR highlights a phenomenon which can better be\nexplained by perdurantists than by endurantists. To understand the\nphenomenon, imagine a three-dimensional cylindrical chocolate cake\nwhich you want to cut up into two-dimensional pieces (you’ve got\na lot of friends). If you cut only at right angles to the length of\nthe cake, then each piece will be circular. But if you cut at a\ndifferent angle, then each piece will be oval. The cylindrical shape\nof the cake explains the shapes of the various pieces produced by\ncutting at various angles. \nNow imagine a four-dimensional object, cut into three-dimensional\ntimeslices. In a non-relativistic world, there’s only one way to\ndo this, because there’s only one way to divide up events into\ngroups of simultaneous events: it’s like cutting the cake at\nright-angles. But, by relativising simultaneity to reference frames,\nSTR gives us lots of different ways to cut the four-dimensional object\ninto three-dimensional slices, just as there are lots of different\nangles at which to cut the cake. The shape of the three-dimensional\nslices you get by cutting in different ways, from the perspective of\ndifferent reference frames, can all be explained by the shape of the\nfour-dimensional object you’re cutting up. \nEndurantists don’t think there is any four-dimensional object to\ndo this explaining job. There are only the three-dimensional slices,\nwhich are just the single, persisting three-dimensional object (each\nslice is that object, at a different time). STR tells us that the\npersisting thing has different three-dimensional shapes with respect\nto different reference frames. The different shapes in different\nreference frames are correlated, but according to the endurance\ntheorist there is no ‘underlying’ four-dimensional object\nto explain these correlations. Endurantists may respond by questioning\nthe need for explanation here. \nIn short, while the general ambience of modern physics may seem more\nfriendly to perdurance than to endurance theory, it is remarkably\ndifficult to devise any conclusive argument from physics to temporal\nparts. \nMore recent concerns have focused on how the various theories of\npersistence can be formulated within a relativistic framework: can we\nsustain a distinction between temporal and spatial parts, or should we\nthink in terms of spatiotemporal parts?  \nSuggested Reading: Balashov (2011) is an advanced\noverview of these issues, Hawley (2009) is much more introductory, and\nGilmore (2008) is a very useful middle ground; Balashov (2008) is a\nmore technical paper which attempts precise definitions of the rival\ntheories of persistence against a relativistic backdrop. Broad (1927,\nchapter 2) is an early discussion of the links between perdurantism\nand STR; see also Quine (1960, p. 172); Rea (1998b, section 1.1)\nresponds. Mellor (1981) argues that STR is compatible with\nendurantism, while Mellor (1980) argues that the General Theory of\nRelativity is also compatible with endurantism, contrary to Nerlich\n(1979). Balashov (1999; 2000a) argues that perdurantism can better\nexplain relativistic phenomena. Balashov (2002) argues that STR\nfavours perdurantism over stage theory; Balashov (2000b) raises\nfurther problems for endurantism, while Gilmore (2002) responds,\nfollowed by Balashov (2005a); Gilmore (2006) develops a relativistic\nversion of endurance theory. Hales and Johnson (2003) weigh in against\nendurance theory; see also Hales and Johnson (2007), and Schmidt\n(2015). Further installments include Balashov (2009), Sattig (2006),\nMiller (2004), Harrington (2005), Gibson and Pooley (2006). See also\nHudson (2005) and Balashov (2010) for book-length treatments of this\nand related topics. McCall and Lowe (2003) argue for an STR-friendly\nnotion of the flow of time. Davidson (2013). Balashov (2014), and\nCalosi (2015) exchange arguments about four-dimensional shapes in\nrelativistic contexts. Pashby (2013) argues that quantum objects lack\ntemporal parts, see also Pashby (2016); Gomori and Szabo (2019)\ndiscuss the persistence of the electromagnetic field . \nSuppose we accept that ordinary persisting things have temporal parts.\nWhat can we say about the relations which hold between those temporal\nparts? For example: must the different temporal parts of a single\nobject lie along a smooth trajectory through space and time, or can\nobjects jump about instantaneously, or pop out of and back into\nexistence? Similar questions also arise for endurantists, and not all\nperdurantists answer these questions in the same way, but for the most\npart perdurantists do agree on a particular type of answer to these\nquestions. This is because perdurantism is very often held in\nconjunction with two other doctrines: the doctrine of universalism,\nand that of Humean Supervenience. \nUniversalism is the view that any collection of objects whatsoever has\na sum, an object they compose. Thinking just of the present moment,\nthis entails that there is an object composed right now of your left\near, the front fork of your bicycle, and the Louvre. If you think\nabout all times, and imagine that ordinary things are made of\ninstantaneous temporal parts, then you can see that universalist\nperdurantists believe in quite an extraordinary number of objects. Any\ncombination of temporal parts of any objects from any times, no matter\nhow scattered and disparate, composes an object. So there is an object\nmade of your maternal grandmother’s wedding ring on the day she\nwas married, your right ear yesterday and a brief temporal part of an\nelectron in the year 2525. (Universalism is sometimes called\n‘unrestricted mereology’, ‘unrestricted\ncomposition’ or ‘unrestricted fusion’;\n‘fusion’ means ‘sum’. For more on\nuniversalism, see the separate entry on\n mereology,\n especially section 4.2.) \nThere are a number of reasons why perdurantists typically adopt\nuniversalism  First, the claim that there is a large number of\nnested four-dimensional objects is central to the most common\nperdurantist account of vagueness in persistence (see\n section 5).\n The building doesn’t seem to have a clear last moment of\nexistence because there are very many coinciding building-shaped\nfour-dimensional objects, each of which ends at a slightly different\nmoment, and it is vague which of these is ‘the building’.\nWhether its role in this story is a reason to accept universalism\ndepends upon the strength or weakness of alternative accounts of\nvagueness in persistence. \nSecond, it often seems that whether or not an object survives a\ncertain kind of change is in some sense conventional, or up to us.\nMany believe that we set the standards for how many repairs you can\nmake to your bicycle without destroying it, and that whether or not a\nperson can survive massive memory loss is partly a matter of what we\nmean by ‘person’. How things persist seems sometimes to be\na matter of what kind of classifications we choose to use. A radical\nversion of this suggests that physical objects come into and out of\nexistence when we decide they do. This sounds mysterious: how could we\nhave such powers? But the combination of universalism and perdurantism\npermits a less radical version of the view: there are lots of\nfour-dimensional objects which share temporal parts with the wheeled\nthing in your bike shed, and it’s up to us which one of those\ncounts as a ‘bicycle’. Similarly, perhaps it’s up to\nus which of the multitude of four-dimensional objects count as\n‘people’.  \nThird, perdurantists who reject universalism seem committed to giving\nan account of the difference between collections of temporal parts\nwhich have a sum, and collections which do not. But such accounts seem\nto permit borderline cases, in which it’s not clear whether a\ncertain collection has a sum. And borderline cases look like cases in\nwhich it is not clear whether a certain object (the sum of those\nparts) exists or not. And many find such vagueness in existence\nunacceptable. Objections to this argument turn on whether\nnon-universalists really have to give such an account, and on whether\nvague existence really is unacceptable. \nThis third type of argument for universalism has also been used to\nargue directly for the existence of temporal parts. Roughly speaking,\ninstead of asking which temporal parts have a sum, we ask which\nmatter-filled regions exactly contain objects. Unless we agree that\nthey all do, we will get into trouble with borderline cases,\nas in the previous paragraph. But if every matter-filled region\nexactly contains an object, then even three-dimensional matter-filled\nregions exactly contain objects. So the world is full of instantaneous\nobjects: these look very like temporal parts. This argument is now\noften known as the ‘argument from vagueness’. Objections\nhere include those mentioned in the previous paragraph; we might also\nquestion whether the instantaneous objects are really temporal\nparts. \nHowever they argue for their position, perdurantists who are also\nuniversalists have an easy answer to some questions about what paths\nobjects may take through space-time: any series of\nobject-stages composes an object. It is certainly interesting to ask\nwhich of those objects are bicycles, or ships, or people, but these\nnow look like questions about the classification of objects, rather\nthan questions about persistence. \nThe other doctrine which usually goes along with perdurantism is\nHumean Supervenience. This is the claim that, roughly speaking, facts\nabout which intrinsic properties are instantiated at which points\ndetermine all the facts there are. There are no irreducibly holistic\nfacts. In conjunction with perdurantism, this entails that all the\nfacts about a given persisting object supervene upon intrinsic facts\nabout its briefest temporal parts. That’s to say, if you fix\nwhat’s happening at each moment, you’ve fixed everything.\nThis sounds pretty plausible, but it turns out that it’s rather\ndifficult to reduce facts about motion, for example, to suitable\nmoment-by-moment facts. \nThere are various responses to this difficulty. Endurantists are not\nusually tempted by Humean Supervenience, since they are committed to\nfacts about identity between objects wholly existing at different\ntimes, and these identity facts are not easily reducible to\nmoment-by-moment facts. So some take the difficulty for Humean\nSupervenience to be a reason for adopting endurantism. Some\nperdurantists stick with perdurantism, but reject Humean\nSupervenience. Instead, they accept that some facts about persisting\nobjects cannot be reduced to facts about their briefest temporal\nparts; they may accept, for example, that causal relations between\nearlier and later parts are irreducible in this way. Finally, some\nperdurantists insist that the supposed facts which seem to cause\nproblems for Humean Supervenience are not real facts after all. \nSuggested Reading: Lewis (1986a, pp. 212–3),\nHeller (1990, section 2.9), Jubien (1993, section 2.2), Quine (1981,\nchapter 1), Rea (1998a) and Hudson (2000) argue for universalism; van\nInwagen (1990b, section 8), Markosian (1998), Merricks (2001) and\nVarzi (2003) object in various ways. Balashov (2007a) discusses\nuniversalism and stage theory; Campdelacreu (2010) responds. Sosa\n(1999) investigates the options for endurantist universalism, whilst\nMiller (2006) develops an endurantist ‘universalism’ based\non constitution rather than parthood; see also Inman (2014). Sider\n(1997; 2001, section 4.9) develops the ‘argument from\nvagueness’ via universalism to temporal parts; Koslicki (2003)\nis critical, while Sider (2003a) responds. Further discussions of\nSider’s argument include Balashov (2005), Nolan (2006),\nMarkosian (2004), Sider (2004), Miller (2005a), Varzi (2005), Noonan\n(2010), Magidor (2015) and Eagle (2016b). Korman (2010) provides an\noverview of this debate, with further references. Hirsch (1982) is an\nextensive, rewarding discussion of criteria of persistence. Humean\nSupervenience is articulated by Lewis (1986b, pp. ix-x), and discussed\nby Loewer (1996). The problem about motion is raised by Armstrong\n(1980), and addressed by Robinson (1989) Hawley (1999; 2001, chapter\n3), Zimmerman (1998b; 1999), Callender (2001), Sider (2001, section\n6.5), Lewis (1999), Teller (2002) and Butterfield (2006), while\nJaskolla (2017) makes intriguing connections between this debate and\npanpsychism. Butterfield (2005) raises many interesting connections\nbetween the physics of motion and the metaphysics of persistence, see\nalso Pashby (2016). Balashov (2003a, 2003b, 2010), Hudson (2002,\n2003), Effingham (2011) and Torre (2015) discuss issues about\nrestricted composition and laws of nature. Haslanger (1994) discusses\nthe connection between endurance and Humean Supervenience; Hawley\n(2015) discusses links between persistence, temporary intrinsics and\nHumean Supervenience in Lewis’s work. Oakes (2004) raises causal\ndifficulties for perdurantism without relying on HS. Magidor (2016)\nargues that much of the debate around perdurance and endurance looks\nvery different when we notice implicit assumptions about universalism;\nsee also Miller (2008) and Varzi (2007). Della Rocca (2011) argues\nthat endurantists must adopt an implausible kind of anti-reductionism\nabout persistence; Baker (2013) responds. \nIssues about the persistence of people are the subject of an entire\nencyclopedia article in their own right (see the separate entry on\n personal identity),\n but it is worth highlighting points where the arguments discussed in\nearlier sections have special consequences for personal survival.\nPeople have various distinctive features: we have moral status, we\nhave mental properties like reasoning and being conscious, and we are\nassociated in an intimate but somewhat puzzling way with living\norganisms.  Moreover, most of us seem to have a special concern\nfor our own future, and are willing to limit current pleasures like\nsmoking, shopping, and not writing encyclopedia articles, because we\nbelieve that sacrifices made now will benefit us in the future. We\nalso feel a distinctive kind of pride or shame about our own past\nactions, and are bound by our own past promises but not by those of\nother people. \nIs there room for these distinctive features within the different\ntheories of persistence? It has been suggested that only endurantists\ncan justify our willingness to make sacrifices for our future selves,\nto act upon the plans formulated by our past selves, and to rely upon\nthe evidence gathered by our past selves . The idea is that these\nactivities make sense only if a present person is identical to her\npast and future selves. Perdurantists may respond in one of two ways.\nFirst, they may argue that it is the whole, identical,\nfour-dimensional person who makes sacrifices, acts upon plans and\nreasons from evidence, via the activities of her temporal parts.\nAlternatively, they may accept that it is short-lived temporal parts\nwhich act, sacrifice and reason, but that past- and future-regarding\nactions can be justified by the intimate relations between distinct\ntemporal parts of the same person. Stage theorists must take this\nsecond route, for they claim that the person just is a brief stage,\nwho takes responsibility for the actions of her past counterparts, and\nacts to benefit her future counterparts. \nThere are a number of issues about coincidence involving people. For\nexample, it seems that we human people at least coincide with human\norganisms. You occupy the same location as a human organism right now,\nbut it seems that you differ in various ways: the organism may have\nexisted since conception, and will go on until biological death, but\nsome believe that the person does not come into existence until the\norganism is relatively well-developed, and that the person may cease\nto exist before biological death, by entering a persistent vegetative\nstate. You also seem to differ from the organism regarding\nwhat’s possible: perhaps you could have been a robot, or a\ndisembodied intelligence, whereas the organism could not. \nCertain puzzle cases also seem to suggest that a person might divide\ninto two: suppose that, as a result of philosophical confusion on the\nhospital ethics committee, a doctor is permitted to remove the two\nhalves of your brain and implant them into two different (brainless)\nbodies. On one understanding of this process, each of the resulting\npeople has a good claim to be you. Is this a reason to think that two\ncoincident people were walking around together before the operation,\nand that they have only now been separated? \nMoreover, it seems that people are prone to indeterminacy, just like\ncrumbling buildings and bicycles: some people have gradual endings,\nand sometimes, in stories at least, a person can undergo such a\ntraumatic change that it’s not clear whether the same person\nexists after the change. \nWe saw a number of ways of dealing with coincidence and indeterminacy\nmore generally, in\n section 4\n and\n section 5.\n But any talk of either partial or total coincidence involving people\ncan seem problematic, because of concerns about the use of\nfirst-person pronouns (who does your ‘I’ refer to before\nyour brain-splitting operation, if there are two of you?), and about\nmultiplying conscious entities (could two people have literally the\nsame headache? if you merely coincide with a human organism, are you\nsure it’s you who has the headache, and not the organism?).\nIt’s not clear, however, whether we should revise our theories\nof persistence as a consequence of these problems, or whether we\nshould revise our ideas about people. This ‘too many\nthinkers’ problem is discussed in more detail in the entry on\n personal identity. \nThe ‘too many thinkers’ problem looms even if we just\nconsider two entities, the person and the organism, but it\nproliferates if we adopt a combination of perdurantism and\nuniversalism (as discussed in\n section 8).\n On such a view, there seem to be a multitude of person-like entities\nsitting in your chair right now, each with slightly different\nstart-dates and end-dates. Perdurantists may argue that only the\nlongest-lived of these is really a person, and that the others are\nmere temporal parts of a person, but opponents resist this move. \nPeople are especially interesting, but metaphysical questions about\npersistence have been raised for objects of various other kinds,\nincluding musical works, social entities such as institutions or\ngroups of people, and biological species. It is often controversial\nwhat sort of entities these are – material objects, abstract\ntypes, processes, sets? – and so it is also controversial how\nfar the arguments discussed above, which focus on material objects,\nare relevant to these special cases. Useful articles elsewhere in this\nEncyclopedia include\n Philosophy of Music,\n Philosophy of Theater,\n Biological Individuals,\n and\n Social Ontology. \nFinally, this article has focused on debates about temporal parts\nwithin philosophy, with a dash of physics. However temporal parts are\nalso significant within applied ontology, where they may feature\nwithin the conceptual schemes adopted by computer scientists,\nbiologists and others to represent information systematically. \nSuggested Reading: There is a huge literature on\npersonal identity, but everyone should read Williams (1973) and Parfit\n(1971; then 1984 part 3 (at least)). Work on people which is informed\nby the broader debate about persistence includes Lowe (1996), Olson\n(1997; 2007), Merricks (2001), Baker (2000), Hudson (2001), Noonan\n(2003b), Tappenden (2011), Langford (2016), Oyowe (2016). Lewis (1976)\nand Hudson (1999) provide perdurantist accounts of people, while\nMerricks (1999b) advocates endurantism, and Brueckner (2009) responds\nto Merricks; Patrone (2017) advocates stage theory. Haslanger (1992)\nargues that rational enquirers must endure; Rosenkrantz (2005) argues\nfrom self-knowledge to endurance; Prosser (2006) uses the nature of\nexperience to explain away the appeal of endurantism in general;\nParsons (2015) argues from the nature of experience to stage theory,\nsee also Smith (2010); Brink (1997) discusses self-concern in a\nperdurantist framework; Broome (1991 chapter 11) discusses connections\nbetween theories of persistence and utilitarianism; Braddon-Mitchell\nand West (2001) argue that stages are primary. Other questions of\nethics and self-concern are addressed by Olson (2010), Tognazzini\n(2010), Taylor (2013), Miller (2014, 2015), Mullins (2014), and Briggs\nand Nolan (2015). Duncan (2015) argues from the temporal extendedness\nof thought to the falsity of certain views about personal persistence.\nDietz (2020) argues that temporal parts can be agents, whilst\nHochstetter (2015) argues that stages cannot act. Rimmel (2018) argues\nthat tensed belief creates difficulties for perdurantists. Hedden\n(2015) challenges many standard assumptions about the connection\nbetween personal persistence and rationality. Special concerns about\ncoincidence involving people, including ‘too many\nthinkers’ are discussed by Noonan (1999a), Merricks (2003),\nOlson (1997a), Shoemaker (1999), Sider (2003b), Sutton (2014),\nJohnston (2016, 2017), Kovacs (2016, 2019), Kaiserman (2019), Eklund\n(2019), and Longenecker (2019). Burke (1997b), Ehring (1995), Heller\n(2000), Roache (2010), Wasserman (2005) and Demarest (2016) are also\nrelevant.  \nDodd (2004), Thomasson (2004), Caplan and Matheson (2006), Tillman\n(2011), Aliyev (2017), Moruzzi (2018), Alward (2019), Friedell (2020)\ndiscuss the persistence of musical works. Slater and Varzi (2007),\nJansen (2008), Hansson Wahlberg (2014a), Epstein (2015 ch.12), Hawley\n(2017), Faller (2019), Hansson Wahlberg (2019), and Wilhelm (2020)\ndiscuss the persistence of social entities. Merkouris (2014) discusses\nthe persistence of legal treaties. Reydon (2008) discusses biological\nspecies. Nicholson and Dupre eds. (2018) is an open-access collection\nincluding many interesting articles about the persistence and broader\nmetaphysics of biological entities, from a ‘process’\nperspective. A final very special case: Baber (2002) discusses\nGod’s temporal parts; for discussion see the entry on\n the Trinity.\n There are many resources on applied ontology at the Buffalo Ontology\nSite (see Other Internet Resources), whilst Bittner, Donnelly and\nSmith (2004) explicitly discusses endurance and perdurance in an\napplied ontology context.
