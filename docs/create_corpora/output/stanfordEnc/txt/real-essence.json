In order to\nunderstand a great many of Locke’s arguments in Books III and IV of\nthe Essay, it is important to understand what a real essence\nis. Thus, the purpose of this entry is to explain the various\ninterpretations of ‘real essence’ that are in the current\nliterature.  Another reason why this matters is that the concept of\n‘real essence’ (or variations of it) has been at the\ncenter of much of the philosophical debate over natural kind realism\nsince the time of Locke, so some of this entry can serve as an\nhistorical introduction to that debate as well.\n\n\nVery simply stated, a real essence, for Locke, is what makes\nsomething what it is, and in the case of physical substances, it is the\nunderlying physical cause of the object’s observable qualities\n(unless otherwise noted, we shall confine our discussion in this\narticle to the real essences of material substances). A nominal\nessence, on the other hand, is an abstract idea that we make when we\nidentify similar qualities shared by objects; the nominal essence is\nthe idea of those shared similarities. The distinction between\nreal and nominal essences plays an important semantic role in Book III\nand an important epistemological role in Book IV of the\nEssay. The semantic role will be discussed more below,\nbut in a nutshell, Locke argues in Book III that words have meaning\nonly insofar as we can attach ideas to them. Since nominal\nessences are the abstract ideas we use to name and distinguish the\nspecies or genera of things, the meanings of our species or genera\nterms just are abstract ideas. For example, a common idea of\npenguins is of short, black and white flightless waterfowl. That\nabstract idea is the meaning of the word ‘penguin’.\nBy contrast, Locke goes on to argue, we have no ideas of real essences\nand so our species or genus terms refer to the nominal essences, not to\nthe real essences (II.xxxi.6; citations to Locke’s\nEssay are given as book, chapter, section; so Book II, chapter\nxxxi, section 6 is given as “II.xxxi.6”).\n\n\nRegarding knowledge, in Book IV Locke argues that knowledge is real\nonly if our ideas correspond to their archetypes in the appropriate\nway. Scientific knowledge occurs when our nominal essence ideas\nmatch the real essences. According to Locke, in mathematics\nand morality the nominal and real essences are the same. That is,\nthe definitions of mathematical or moral concepts constitute both the\nnominal and real essences of those concepts. For that reason it\nis possible to have a human science of mathematics and morality.\nIn the case of substances, however, the real and nominal essences are\nalways different, and so there is no possible human science of\nsubstances (IV.vi.12–16).\n\n\n\nThe canonical definition of the real essences is given in\nIII.iii.15, where Locke contrasts his ‘real essences’ with\nwhat he calls ‘nominal essences’: \nFirst, Essence may be taken for the very being of any thing,\nwhereby it is, what it is. And thus the real internal, but generally in\nSubstances,   unknown Constitution\nof Things, whereon their discoverable Qualities depend, may be called\ntheir Essence…Secondly,…it being\nevident, that Things are ranked under Names into sorts or\nSpecies, only as they agree to certain abstract\nIdeas, to which we have annexed those Names, the \nEssence of each Genus, or Sort, comes to\nbe nothing but that abstract Idea, which the General, or\nSortal (if I may have leave so to call it from\nSort, as I do General from\nGenus,) Name stands for. And this we shall find to be\nthat, which the Word Essence imports, in its most familiar\nuse.   These two sorts of\nEssences, I suppose, may not unfitly be termed, the one the\nReal, the other the Nominal Essence. \n\nReal essences are the submicroscopic constitutions which cause the\nobservable qualities of substances, and the nominal essences are the\nabstract ideas that constitute the definitions of species or\ngenera. To flesh this out a little more clearly we must define a\nfew more terms. Locke defines the ‘quality’ of any substance as\n“the Power to produce any Idea in our mind”\n(II.viii.8). There are three categories of qualities according to\nthe mechanical natural philosophy. Primary qualities are\nthe inseparable features of a body, e.g., its size, shape, solidity,\nmobility, texture, weight, etc. (II.viii.9). Secondary\nqualities are the colors, sounds, smells, tastes, etc., of any\nobject. These are secondary because these features of\nobjects do not exist in the objects themselves, but rather are nothing\nbut the power of the primary qualities of the object to produce an idea\nin us of a certain kind (II.viii.10). So, for example, the color of the\ntable is not in the table, rather, it is part of how the matter and\ntexture of the table (i.e., its primary qualities), as it reflects,\nabsorbs and refracts light, has the power to produce ideas in us of\nthat color. Finally, the tertiary qualities of a body\nare those powers in it that, by virtue of its primary qualities, give\nit the power to produce observable changes in the primary qualities of\nother bodies, e.g., the power of the sun to melt wax is a tertiary\nquality of the sun (II.viii.23). \n\nWhen one creates a nominal essence, one is cobbling together a\ncollection of particular qualities—from among these three kinds\nof qualities—that one observes together in a substance and making\nthat collection definitive of a species or genus. Having said\nthat, I should point out that when Locke thinks of a species\nor genus, he is not thinking of these terms as applying\nexclusively in the biological realm, but rather as applying generally\nto any possible classification scheme we create when we organize our\nworld through naming. So, for example, gold is as much a\nspecies of the genus metal as human is a species of\nthe genus animal. \n\nThe term ‘nominal’ refers to names or naming, and is\nused by Locke to indicate that classifying substances based on their\nsimilar qualities is an exercise in naming. For example, the\nnominal essence of gold is the abstract idea that constitutes our\ndefinition of ‘gold’, i.e., yellowish, heavy, malleable\nmetal that can be dissolved in Aqua Regia, but not in\nsulfuric acid, etc. According to Locke, the nominal essence\ncontains the properties that give meaning to the name\n‘gold’ and allow us to know what gold is wherever we find\nit. What makes the nominal essence an essence is that it\ncontains both the necessary and sufficient conditions for something to\nbelong to its species or genus. Because of how gold is defined,\nevery yellowish, heavy, malleable metal that dissolves in water and\nhydrochloric acid and not in sulfuric acid, is gold. \n\nIn this way, nominal essences are created by human choice: we decide\nwhat we want to include in our definitions of species or genera.\nTo borrow from Locke, species are “the workmanship of the\nunderstanding”, not of nature. \n\n I\nwould not here be thought to forget, much less to deny, that Nature in\nthe Production of Things, makes several of them alike: there is nothing\n more obvious, especially in the Races of Animals, and all Things\npropagated by Seed. But yet, I think, we may say, the sorting\nof them under Names, is the Workmanship of the Understanding,\ntaking occasion from the similitude it observes amongst them, to\nmake abstract general Ideas,\n and set them up in the\nmind, with Names annexed to them, as Patterns, or Forms, (for in that\nsence the word Form has a very proper signification,) to which, as\nparticular Things existing are found to agree, so they come to be of\nthat Species, have that Denomination, or are put   into that\nClassis. (III.iii.13) \n\nNature provides us with similarities and we create definitions of\nspecies and genera. However, no matter how dependent general names are\non our definitions, we are answerable to nature and must keep our\ndefinitions as close as we can to what nature provides. It is in\nthis sense that species and genera are the workmanship of the human\nunderstanding; we take what nature gives us and we create our own\ndefinitions and taxonomical categories. \n\nOn the other hand, a real essence is an essence\nbecause it makes the object to be what it is. It is real\nin that it does not include human choice for it to be what it is,\nrather, it is precisely as nature made it. In the case of a piece\nof gold, the real essence is that collection of particles that make up\nthat particular piece of gold and give it its qualities of color,\nweight, electrical conductivity, malleability, etc.. \n\nLocke’s above definition of real and nominal essences is given\nas a critical response to the Aristotelian influenced Scholasticism of\nthe late medieval and early renaissance natural philosophy.\nLocke’s distinction between real and nominal essences appears to\nbe in reference to the Aristotelian distinction between real and\nnominal definitions. A real definition, according to the\nAristotelian tradition, is one that accords with the natural hierarchy\nand identifies the essence of the species or genus being studied, e.g.,\n‘man is the rational animal’ (reason being the\nessence of the species, animal being the genus). A\nnominal definition, by contrast, is a pseudo-definition that identifies\nthe members of the species or genus, but fails to capture the essence,\ne.g., ‘man is the featherless biped’. A science of\nnature, for Aristotle and the Scholastics, consists of real definitions\nand not mere nominal ones. While Locke agrees that a science\nrequires knowledge of essences, and thus of species, he differs from\nthe Aristotelians by arguing that there are no real definitions of\nsubstances, but there are of moral and mathematical concepts (see\nAyers 1996, Locke, vol. II, pp. 18–30). \n\nAccording to the Scholastic way of understanding the term\n‘essence’, it refers to what makes a thing what it is: \n\nConcerning the real Essences of corporeal Substances, (to mention those\nonly,) there are, if I mistake not, two Opinions. The one is of those,\nwho   using the Word Essence, for they know not what,\nsuppose a certain number of those Essences, according to which, all\nnatural things are made,   and wherein they do exactly every\none of them partake, and so become of this or that Species.\n(III.iii.17) \n\nThe Scholastic concept of essence, or what is more properly called a\n‘substantial form’, is of an imperceptible, immaterial\nessence that imposes order onto the matter that it is joined with and\nmakes it a member of a natural species or genus, imbuing it with all of\nits relevant characteristics, i.e., its essential properties.\nEssential properties are those features that tell us to what species or\ngenus an object belongs, e.g., being warm blooded is an essential\nproperty of mammals, being rational is an essential property of humans,\nbeing yellowish and heavy are essential properties of gold. Each\nof these essential properties is caused by the substantial form that is\nconjoined with the matter of the substance to make it what it is.\n In this way, then, the substantial form of any object in the\nScholastic theory plays two roles: it (a) tells us to what species the\nsubstance belongs; and (b) it causes the observable qualities and\nproperties of the substance. For example, according to the\nScholastic theory, a lump of gold is an instance of gold\nbecause its matter possesses the substantial form of gold which causes\nall of the properties of gold, e.g., malleability, yellowish color,\nheaviness, etc.. \n\nBy contrast, however, Locke does not think of the essence of a\nphysical object as an immaterial substantial form, nor does he think\nthat a single entity can play both roles of determining the species or\ngenus membership of a substance and be the unobservable\nunderlying cause of the qualities of the substance. Instead,\nLocke divides up the concept of essence into two different concepts\nplaying two distinct roles. First, he defines the real\nessence of physical objects as the internal constitution of the\nsubstance that is the cause of the observable qualities of the\nobject. He then argues that this internal constitution is not\nwhat answers the ‘what is it?’ question because the species\nmembership of physical beings is only determined by their outward\nappearance, i.e., by their nominal essences. Second, he defines\nthe nominal essence as that collection of observable qualities that are\nincluded in the definition of the species or genus. This process\nhas three stages; we create an abstract idea based on similarities\namong objects, we then give a name to that abstract idea, and finally\nwe classify objects that fit our abstract idea into the same species or\ngenus. So, for Locke, the real essence plays role (b), that is,\nthe causal and explanatory role of being the physical cause of the\nproperties and qualities of each substance; but only the nominal\nessence plays role (a), that is, the nominal essence alone determines\nits species or genus membership. The chart below illustrates this\ndivision of labor: \nOne of Locke’s main purposes in making this distinction is to\ndeploy it in his criticisms of the Scholastic account of (a), the\nspecies of natural substances. However, when criticizing the\nScholastic account of (b), the explanation of the qualities of bodies,\nLocke typically refrains from invoking the concept of ‘real\nessence’ and instead talks about the primary, secondary and\ntertiary qualities of bodies (see, for example II.viii.10–26).\nSo, at a minimum, it seems that Locke invoked this distinction between\nreal and nominal essences in order to prove a negative point: real\nessences are not relevant to role (a). \n\nAs noted above, according to the Scholastics, species and genera are\ncreated by nature; every natural substance is a combination of matter\nand substantial form. Matter, on its own, is inert and does not\ncause anything. By contrast, the substantial form of any\nsubstance is its species essence, which is an immaterial entity that\nmakes the object what it is, makes it a member of a particular species\nand genus and causes its characteristic properties. So, for the\nScholastics, all natural substances belong to a determinate species by\nnature, independently of any human naming activities. On this\nview then, if we know what qualities a substance possesses, and we know\nthat all qualities are produced by a substantial form, then it is a\nsimple matter to determine its species simply by noting the qualities\nthe substance exhibits. For example, if what makes a particular\nobject a piece of gold is the possession of the substantial form of\ngold, then whatever exhibits the properties of gold has the substantial\nform of gold, and so we know the species to which it belongs is\ngold. Creating a taxonomy for the Scholastics is\nattempting to discover how nature has already classified substances\ninto species and genera by looking for similarities among their\npersistent qualities (qualities that tend to remain even when the\ncircumstances or conditions of the object change) that reveal the\ndeeper similarity of sharing substantial forms. \n\nBy distinguishing between real and nominal essences, Locke can\ndeploy these new concepts in a sustained critique of the Scholastic\ntheory of species. Locke offers three main arguments\nagainst the Scholastic view. \n\nFirst, he deploys the corpuscularian hypothesis against the\nScholastics to argue that ‘borderline cases’ create a\nserious challenge to their doctrine of substantial forms, but which are\nallowed for, and even explained by, corpuscularian principles. By\nhis lights, if we assume that nature produces substances by imposing a\nsubstantial form (what Locke mockingly calls ‘moulds and forms’),\nor species essence onto them, then the existence of entities that do\nnot fit into any single species shows us at least that not all beings\nare produced according to natural moulds and forms: \n\n[The opinion] which supposes these Essences, as a certain\nnumber of Forms or Molds, wherein all natural Things, that exist, are\ncast, and do   equally partake, has,\nI imagine, very much perplexed the Knowledge of natural Things. The\nfrequent Productions of Monsters, in all the Species\n of Animals, and\nof Changelings, and other strange Issues of humane Birth, carry with\nthem difficulties, not possible to consist with this \nHypothesis: Since it is as impossible, that two Things,\npartaking exactly of the same real Essence, should have\ndifferent Properties, as that two Figures partaking in the same real\nEssence of a Circle, should have different Properties.\n(III.iii.17) \n\nIf nature made species or genera by giving all members of the same\nkind the same form or mould (or, he seems to suggest above, real\nessence), then there would be no way to explain generative variation in\nnature (he reiterates this kind of argument in III.vi.15–17) or the\ndifferences between samples of the same species of chemicals or\nminerals. On the other hand, if nature makes real essences, which\nare material structures that cause the observable qualities of each\nsubstance, then these kinds of variations can be explained by\nvariations among the physical structures of the bodies (see Jolley 1999,\npp. 144–50). \n\nSecondly, as we saw above, Locke adduces the semantic point that our\ngeneral terms (and their corresponding ideas), being human constructs\nvia the process of abstraction, constitute the (nominal)\nessences of things, not some immaterial substantial form:\n“Whereby it is evident, that the Essences of the\nsorts, or (if the Latin word pleases better) Species\nof Things, are nothing else but these abstract Ideas”\n(III.iii.12). Abstract ideas are formed when we take a set of objects\nand mentally strip away enough particular ideas to reveal what\nproperties they all have in common. The resulting ideas are\npurely mental constructions; the putative substantial forms of the\nobjects are irrelevant to this process. Therefore, essences and\nspecies are human constructs, not the products of nature, i.e., they\nare purely nominal. \n\nLocke’s third argument rests on the Scholastic’s\nassumption that nature produces many things alike. The natural\nproduction of physically similar entities, however, is a double-edged\nsword. Nature not only produces similarities among objects, but\nit produces far too many similarities. That is, among the vast\narray of similar qualities that objects share we must select those few\nwhich we take to be important enough to constitute the meaning of the\ngeneral term and thereby constitute the species or genus. This\nselection process is not something that nature can do, only we can\ndecide which qualities are important enough to count as part of the\ndefinition of a species or genus. \n\nBy introducing the distinction between real and nominal essences and\nthereby dividing their roles, Locke has provided himself with a number\nof resources to criticize the Scholastic theory of species. \n\nWhile the concept and definition of ‘real essence’ is\noriginal with Locke, at least a generation before him there were\nEnglishmen who defended non-Scholastic taxonomical theories that\nemployed material structures, either atomic or corpuscularian\nstructures, to play both roles (a) and (b), and therefore serve as the\nessences of physical substances. One notable example is from Sir\nFrancis Bacon. \n\nIn Book II §§i–vii of The New Organon (1620),\nBacon seems to give a version of corpuscular natural kinds by\nredefining the concept of ‘formal cause’ as both the\nmaterial structure of bodies and the laws that govern the natural\neffects of these structures that accounts for their species and genus\nmembership. For example, in II.ii he says,\n \nFor though\nnothing exists in nature except individual bodies which exhibit pure\nindividual acts [powers] in accordance with law…It is this law\nand its clauses which we understand by the term Forms….\n(Bacon 1620, 103)\n \nAnd later in II.iii: “But he who knows forms comprehends the\nunity of nature in very different materials” (Bacon 1620,\n103). These Baconian forms, as they constitute the powers of material\nbodies, divide nature into two classes of material structures: the\nelements (what he calls ‘major associations’) and the\ngenera and species of natural bodies (his ‘minor\nassociations’): \n\nWe want elements to be understood in the sense not of the prime\nqualities of things, but of the major constituents of natural\nbodies. For the nature of things is so distributed that the\nquantity or mass of certain bodies is very great, because their\nstructure requires the texture of an easy and common\nmaterial…But the quantity of certain other bodies in the\nuniverse is small and occurs rarely, because the texture of their\nmatter is very different, very subtle and for the most part delimited\nand organic; such are the species of natural things, metals, plants,\nanimals. (Bacon 1620, 226) \n\nAccording to Bacon, more general material structures convene to\ncreate larger—and more sparse—bodies, and given the laws of\nnature that correlate powers to these structures, these bodies have\ntheir natures and belong to a species or genus due to the structures\nand causal powers of their constituent parts. Baconian forms\nexhibit the two features of what me might call ‘corpuscular\nforms’: material structures plus the laws of nature combine to\ncause and explain the properties of bodies and determine their\nspecies\n membership.[2] \n\nSimilarly, in the Origine of Formes and Qualities,\nRobert Boyle employs the concept of a material essence when he argues\nfor the existence of corpuscular forms that do all the same\nphilosophical and explanatory work as both the real and nominal\nessences: \n\n…why may we not say, that the Form of a Body, being made up\nof those Qualities united in one Subject, doth likewise consist in such\na Convention of those newly nam’d Mechanical Affections of\nMatter, as is necessary to constitute a Body of that Determinate\nkind. And so, though I shall for brevities sake retain the word\nForme, yet I would be understood to mean by it, not a Real\nSubstance distinct from Matter, but onely the Matter it self\nof a Natural Body, consider’d with its peculiar manner of Existence\n[corpuscular structure], which I think may not inconveniently be\ncall’d either its Specifical or its Denominating\nState, or its Essential Modification, or, if you would\nhave me express it in one word, its Stamp: for such a\nConvention of Accidents is sufficient to perform the Offices that are\nnecessarily requir’d in what Men call a Forme, since it makes\nthe body such as it is, making it appertain to this or that\nDeterminate Species of Bodies, and discriminating it from all other\nSpecies of Bodies whatsoever…. (Boyle 1666, p. 324.) \n\nThat is, Boylean corpuscular forms both cause and explain the\nqualities of bodies and sort natural bodies into species based on the\nstructure of the matter and the laws binding qualities to the\nspecific\n structures.[3] \n\nSo, we see that there are corpuscular versions of natural kind\nrealism afoot in early seventeenth-century England where both roles of\ndetermining the species or genus membership and of causing and\nexplaining the observable qualities are played by the same entity:\ncorpuscular structure. The degree to which Locke agrees with,\nrejects or even engages with these views is a matter of scholarly\ncontroversy. \n\nNevertheless, we can say that, just as with the Scholastic natural\nphilosophy, there were adherents to the mechanical natural philosophy\nwho postulated a single entity to play both the causal and\nclassificatory roles; we can call these philosophers ‘corpuscular\nrealists’ and we may say that they argue for the existence of\nwhat we might call ‘corpuscular species’, i.e., species\ncreated by nature by corpuscular forms. By contrast, again, Locke\nobjects to this general approach for the creation of a scientific\ntaxonomy: \n\nNor indeed can we rank, and sort Things, and\nconsequently (which is the end of sorting) denominate them by their\nreal Essences, because we \nknow them not. Our Faculties carry us no farther towards the knowledge\nand distinction of Substances, than a Collection of those sensible\nIdeas, which we observe in them; which however made with the\ngreatest diligence and exactness, we are capable of, yet is more remote\nfrom the true internal Constitution, from which those Qualities flow,\nthan, as I said, a Countryman’s Idea is from the inward\ncontrivance of that famous Clock   at Strasburg, whereof\nhe only sees the outward Figure and Motions. (III.vi.9) \n\nIf we have no knowledge of real essences, then there is no way to\nuse real essences in our sorting practice. Moreover, as he\nalludes at the end of the quotation, in order for a general inference\nabout the internal constitutions of substances to be justified, we\nwould have to know a lot more about the causal connections between the\ninternal constitution and what we observe than we do:\n \n …it\nis impossible for us to know, that this or that quality or\nIdea has a necessary connexion with a real Essence, of which\nwe have no Idea at all, whatever Species that supposed real\nEssence may be imagined to constitute. (IV.vi.5) \n\nThe differences between Locke and the natural kind realists from\namong the ranks of the corpuscularians can be illustrated by the\nfollowing chart: \n\nThere are Locke scholars who (though this is controversial) argue\nthat Locke uses this distinction between real and nominal essences to\ncriticize the taxonomical theories of both the Scholastics and those\nmechanistic natural philosophers who invoke corpuscular species forms\n(see Jones 2010, pp. 147–172). \n\nIt is universally agreed that Locke thinks that we sort things into\nspecies and genera based on nominal essences and species and genera are\na kind of human linguistic categorization process. On the other\nhand, one might think, Locke has no reason to reject natural kinds\n(which concern the metaphysics of nature, and not the meanings of\nnames) simply because our sorting process is arbitrary. In other\nwords, there are those who argue that Locke was a natural kind realist,\neven though he was convinced that taxonomies are the workmanship of the\nunderstanding. Whether Locke thinks that there are natural kinds,\ni.e., types of real essences independently of human sorting activities,\nis an interpretive issue we shall address in\n 4.3 below. \n\nIn this section, I discuss four main areas of interpretive dispute\nconcerning real essences: (i) relativized real essences; (ii)\nindividual real essences; (iii) real essences and natural kinds; and\n(iv) real essences, internal constitutions and substance. \n\nThere are two main interpretations of real essences in the\nliterature: the relativized real essence thesis, according to which a\nreal essence just is whatever microstructure causes the nominally\nessential qualities of the object; and (for lack of a better name) the\nunrelativized real essence thesis, whereby the real essences consist of\nthe total microstructure of the substance, not just the features\ncausally responsible for the nominal essence. Textual evidence\nfor the relativized real essence thesis comes from III.vi.6: \n\nBy this real Essence, I mean, that real constitution of any\nThing, which is the foundation of all those Properties, that are\ncombined in, and are constantly found to co-exist with the nominal\nEssence; that particular constitution, which every Thing has\nwithin it self, without any relation to any thing without it. But\nEssence, even in this sense, relates to a Sort, and\nsupposes a Species: For being that real Constitution, on which\nthe Properties depend, it necessarily supposes a sort of Things,\nProperties belonging only to Species, and not to\nIndividuals…Here are Essences and Properties,\nbut all upon supposition of a Sort, or general abstract Idea,\nwhich is considered as immutable: but there is no individual parcel of\nMatter, to which any of these Qualities are so annexed, as to be\nessential to it, or inseparable from it. That which is\nessential, belongs to it as a Condition, whereby it is of this\nor that Sort: But take away the consideration of its being ranked under\nthe name of some abstract Idea, and then there is nothing\nnecessary to it, nothing inseparable from it.\n [4] \n\nSome Locke scholars take this to imply that the real essence is\nalways relativized to the nominal essence for Locke. If\nproperties belong only to species—not to individuals—and\nreal essences are defined as the real constitution of a thing that is\nthe foundation of its properties, then it seems to follow that the real\nessence of a thing is defined in relation to the species to which the\nthing belongs. \n\nCritics of the relativized real essence interpretation of the Essay\nwill point out that if real essences are only for sorted substances,\nthen Locke ought to consistently use the term ‘real\nessence’ whenever referring to the submicroscopic structure of\nsorted individuals. However, in II.xxiii.37 Locke uses\n‘internal constitution,’ not ‘real essence’ to\nrefer to the causal ground of the nominally essential qualities of\ngold: \n\n…the greatest part of the Ideas, that make our complex\nIdea of Gold, are Yellowness, great Weight,\nDuctility, Fusibility, and Solubility, in Aqua\n Regia, etc. all united together in an unknown Substratum; all which\nIdeas, are nothing else, but so many relations to other\nSubstances; and are \nnot really in the Gold, considered barely in it self, though they\ndepend on those real, and primary Qualities of its internal\nconstitution, whereby it   has\na fitness, differently to operate, and be operated on by several other\nSubstances. \n\nThese powers he lists are nominally essential properties of gold,\nbut since Locke refers to their causal ground as an ‘internal\nconstitution’ and not as a ‘real essence,’ one might\nargue, it seems that ‘real essence’ is not uniquely\nemployed to designate the submicroscopic foundation of the powers\nincluded within the nominal essence. \n\nMoreover, critics of the relativized real essence interpretation\nwill likely focus on the part of (III.vi.6) that seems to bracket off\nall nominally essential qualities from a real essence: “By\nthis real Essence, I mean, that real constitution of any\nThing…which every Thing has within it self, without any relation\nto any thing without it.” That is, one might argue that if\nwe can consider a real essence all by itself, independently of any\nrelations to other objects or observers, then real essences are not\nrelativized to nominal essences because we can consider a real essence\nwithout reference to “any relation to anything without it”\nand nominally essential qualities require relations to observers. \n\nThere are important issues here that a consistent and plausible\ninterpretation of Locke on real essences must take into account.\nHow one does so will impact what one may say with respect to the\npossibility of real essences for individual objects in Locke. \n\nA related, but importantly distinct issue, concerns the possibility\nof real essences for individuals. On the one hand, if every\nobject has an underlying physical constitution, then there seems to be\nno problem with thinking of individuals has possessing real\nessences. On the other hand, if real essences are only for sorted\nindividuals, then there are no real essences for individuals until we\nhave classified them by a nominal essence; until an individual is\nsorted, it only has an internal constitution, not a real essence.\nIf one adopts the relativized real essence interpretation of the\nEssay, then there are no real essences for unsorted\nindividuals. If, however, one adopts the unrelativized real\nessence interpretation, then it appears possible that Locke could think\nthat unsorted individuals have a real essence and not just an internal\nconstitution. \n\nOf course, in III.vi.4 Locke famously denies that anything is\nessential to a particular: \n\n‘Tis necessary for me to be as I am; GOD and Nature has made me\nso: But there is nothing I have, is essential to me. An Accident, or\nDisease, may very much alter my Colour, or Shape; a Fever, or Fall,\nmay take away my Reason, or Memory, or both; and an Apoplexy leave\nneither Sense, nor Understanding, no nor Life…None of these are\nessential to the one, or the other, or to any Individual whatsoever,\ntill the Mind refers it to some Sort or Species of things;\nand then presently, according to the abstract Idea of that\nsort, something is found\nessential. Let any one\nexamine his own Thoughts, and he will find, that as soon as he supposes or\nspeaks of Essential, the consideration of some\nSpecies, or the\ncomplex Idea, signified by some general name, comes into his Mind: And\n‘tis in reference to that, that this or that Quality is said to be\nessential.  So that if it be asked, whether it\nbe essential to me, or any other particular corporeal Being\nto have Reason? I say no; no more than it is essential to\nthis white thing I write on, to have words in it. But if that\nparticular Being, be to be counted of the sort Man, and to\nhave the name Man given it, then Reason is essential\nto it, supposing Reason to be a part of the complex Idea the\nname Man stands for…. \n\nHowever, one might argue that in this section Locke is only\nconsidering nominally essential qualities and saying that none of the\ncandidates for nominally essential qualities are essential to a being,\nqua species or genus member, until it has been sorted. \n\nMoreover, the second sentence of III.vi.6, where he inserts the\nclarification that a real essence is “…that particular\nconstitution, which every Thing has within it self, without any\nrelation to any thing without it,” appears to say that there can\nbe real essences of unsorted individuals. If a real essence is\ndefinable as a corpuscular structure cum causal powers that a\nbody has independently of anything else, then it seems to\nfollow that there are individual real essences independently of how we\nsort them. That is, if every natural substance has some\nsubmicroscopic corpuscular constitution on which its observable\nqualities depend, then it seems to follow that unsorted individuals\nhave a real\n essence (see Owen 1991 and Vienne\n 1993).[5] \n\nIt is possible that Locke was not always clear and consistent in his\nuse of the term ‘real essence’ and that these puzzles are\nimpossible to resolve. However, it is also possible that when\nLocke was focusing on the precise meanings of terms that he was indeed\ncareful, and there is a consistent interpretation of his views on this\nissue. Either way, any interpretation of Locke on real essences\nmust determine whether there are real essences for only sorted\nindividuals or not. \n\nAnother important exegetical issue that arises in the Essay\nis whether Locke thought that there are natural kinds based on real\nessences. Scientific disciplines categorize the objects they\nstudy into kinds. To say that a kind is natural\nis to say that a grouping of similar individuals exists independently\nof human decisions. The hope of each scientific discipline is to\nidentify as many natural kinds as possible within their domain and to\ndetermine their properties accurately. To this end, we create\nscientific taxonomies, like the periodic table of elements, the\nphylogenetic tree, etc., to organize the kinds we have identified and\nto study their properties. On the face of it, the question of\nwhether there are natural kinds in Locke seems to be the same as the\nquestion of whether there are species, and as we saw above (in\n§§1–3) Locke denies that there are natural species.\nHowever, it is possible to distinguish between a species (a\nclassification humans make based on observed similarities) and a\nnatural kind (a grouping that occurs naturally and independently of\nhuman naming practices). Locke is clearly aware of this\ndistinction, so it is possible that what he has said about sorting and\nnominal essences only reveals what he thinks about nominal essences and\nour practice of sorting, which is a semantic issue, not about the\nmetaphysics of nature. \n\nTo be sure, there are passages in the Essay that seem to\nindicate that Locke was a natural kind realist even if he was a\nconventionalist about taxonomical practices. For example: \n\nThe other, and more rational Opinion, is of those, who look on all\nnatural Things to have a real, but unknown Constitution of their\ninsensible Parts, from which flow those sensible Qualities, which\nserve us to distinguish them one from another, according as we have\nOccasion to rank them into sorts, under common\nDenominations. (III.iii.17) \n\nIn other words, one might argue, if real essences cause the\nobservable qualities of bodies, and we sort things into species based\non observable similarities, then if we assume that similarities among\nthe real essences always results in similar observable qualities, and\nsimilar observable qualities are always caused by similar real\nessences, there is reason to think that Locke assumed that our nominal\nessences track, at least to some degree, real kinds in nature. \n\nThere are places in the Essay where Locke seems to think\nalong these lines. In III.vi.36 he says “Nature makes\nmany particular Things, which do agree one with another, in many\nsensible Qualities, and probably too, in their internal frame and\nConstitution.” In a letter to Molyneux, Locke says: \n\nI hope I have no where said, there is no such sort of creatures in\nnature as birds; if I have, it is both contrary to the truth and to my\nopinion. This I do say, that there are real constitutions in things\nfrom whence these simple ideas flow, which we observ’d combined in\nthem. And this I farther say, that there are real distinctions and\ndifferences in those real constitutions one from another; whereby they\nare distinguished one from another, whether we think of them or name\nthem or no. (Locke, Works, vol. IV, pp. 305–6) \n\nIndeed, there are passages where Locke speaks of the\n“imperfection” of our species ideas and the need to make\nthem better conform to nature. For example, in III.xi.24 he says\nthat: \n\nAnd therefore in Substances, we are not always to rest in the ordinary\ncomplex Idea, commonly received as the signification of that\nWord, but must go a little farther, and enquire into the Nature and\nProperties of the Things themselves, and thereby perfect, as much as\nwe can, our Ideas of their distinct Species… \n\nThere is no reason, so one may argue, to suspect that our species\nideas could be either perfected or imperfect if there is no natural\nkind archetype. On the other hand, there is some evidence that\nLocke anticipated this kind of account and rejected it. For\nexample, he says: \n\n…That we find many of the Individuals that are ranked into one\nSort, called by one common Name, and so received as being of one\nSpecies, have yet Qualities depending on their real\nConstitutions, as far different one from another, as from others, from\nwhich they are accounted to differ\nspecifically. This, as it is easy to be observed by all, who\nhave to do with natural Bodies; so Chymists especially are often, by\nsad Experience, convinced of it, when they, sometimes in vain, seek\nfor the same Qualities in one parcel of Sulphur, Antimony, or Vitriol,\nwhich they have found in others. For though they are Bodies of the\nsame Species, having the same nominal Essence, under\nthe same Name; yet do they often, upon severe ways of examination,\nbetray Qualities so different one from another, as to frustrate the\nExpectation and Labour of very wary Chymists.  But if Things were\ndistinguished into Species, according to their real Essences,\nit would be as impossible to find different Properties in any two\nindividual Substances of the same Species, as it is to find\ndifferent Properties in two Circles, or two equilateral\nTriangles. (III.vi.8) \n\nThis argument is a modus tollens: if the members of a\nnominally defined species had the same type of real essence, then they\nshould all exhibit the same qualities (including those not included in\nthe nominal essence), but they do not exhibit all of the same\nqualities, therefore they do not all have the same type of real\nessence. This question of whether real essences could be the\nfoundation of natural kinds for Locke is as old as the Essay\nitself. Both Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Edward Stillingfleet,\nLord Bishop of Worcester, point out that Locke’s position on real\nessences seems to entail that there are natural kinds based on\nsimilarities among the real essences. As Leibniz put it in his\ncritique of the Essay entitled New Essays on Human\nUnderstanding (1704),   [i]t is true that we cannot define a species in terms\nof something which is unknown to us [e.g., real essences]; but the\nouter features serve in place of it…. (Leibniz 1704, p. 311)\n \nAgain later, he reiterates this point: \n \n[when] I think of a body\nwhich is at once yellow, fusible and resistant to cupellation, I am\nthinking of a body whose specific essence, though hidden from me within\nit, gives rise to these qualities and reveals itself, at least\nconfusedly, through them. (Leibniz 1704, p. 405) \n \nLocke died before Leibniz’s New Essays on Human Understanding\nwere published (they were not published until 1765, sixty-one years\nafter Locke’s death and nearly fifty years after Leibniz’s death), so\nwe do not have Locke’s response to Leibniz’s arguments, nevertheless,\nStillingfleet gave a similar argument and we have Locke’s replies to\nhim. Like Leibniz, Stillingfleet appeals to the concept of real\nessence as a “natural kind” concept, claiming that there\nare types of real essences, and belonging to the same natural kind is a\nfunction of possessing the same kind of real essence: \nBut in this one sun there is a real essence, and not a mere nominal or\nabstracted essence; but suppose there were more suns; would not each\nof them have the real essence of the sun? For what is it makes the\nsecond sun to be a true sun, but having the same real essence with the\nfirst? If it were but a nominal essence, then the second would have\nnothing but the name.  (Locke, Works, vol. IV, p. 83. Here\nLocke is quoting from Stillingfleet’s Discourse in Vindication of\nthe Doctrine of the Trinity, where the latter criticizes\nLocke’s Essay.) Locke’s response is to turn the whole discussion away\nfrom real essences and back onto the nominal essences: \nYour lordship’s proof here brought out of my Essay,\nconcerning the sun, I humbly conceive will not reach it; because what\nis said there, does not at all concern the real, but nominal essence;\nas is evident from hence, that the idea I speak of there, is a complex\nidea; but we have no complex idea of the internal constitution, or\nreal essence of the sun. Besides, I say expressly, that our\ndistinguishing substances into species by names, is not at all founded\non their real essences. So that the sun being one of these substances,\nI cannot, in the place quoted by your lordship, be supposed to mean by\nessence of the sun, the real essence of the sun, unless I had so\nexpressed it. But all this argument will be at an end, when your\nlordship shall have explained what you mean by these words,\n“true sun.” In my sense of them, any thing will be a true\nsun, to which the name sun may be truly and properly applied; and to\nthat substance or thing, the name sun may be truly and properly\napplied, which has united in it that combination of sensible\nqualities, by which any thing else that is called sun is distinguished\nfrom other substances, i.e. by the nominal\nessence…. (Locke, Works, vol. IV, pp. 83–4) Although this is controversial exegetical territory, it\nappears that Locke is aware of this ‘real essence’ version\nof natural kinds, but it further appears that he is unwilling to\ndiscuss it; his response was to steer clear of the metaphysical claim\nand return to the semantic issue of nominal essences. As natural as it is to interpret Locke as a natural kind realist,\nthere are problematic passages for that interpretation.  With respect\nto the similarities among real essences, which was the main concern of\nLeibniz and Stillingfleet, in IV.vi.4 Locke argues that the assumption\nthat species are determined by real essences fails to tell us what\nwould count as a member of any species. That is, because we have no\nknowledge of real essences, no general claims about species would be\njustified and no individual would obviously belong to a particular\nspecies. So the assumption that Leibniz and Stillingfleet propose\nappears to be theoretically unmotivated.  Moreover, as Locke’s\nargument in III.vi.39 suggests, similarities in structure of the real\nessences, even if known, would still require us to decide which\nsimilarities (not to mention what degrees of similarity) would amount\nto similar enough to belong together in the same class: \nFor what is sufficient in the inward Contrivance, to make a new\nSpecies? There are some Watches, that are made with\nfour Wheels, others with \nfive: Is this a specifick difference to the Workman? Some have Strings\nand Physies, and others none; some have the Balance loose, and others\nregulated by a spiral Spring, and others by Hogs Bristles: Are any, or\nall of these enough to make a specifick difference to the Workman, that\nknows each of these, and several other\ndifferent contrivances, in the internal Constitutions of\nWatches? ‘Tis certain, each of these hath a real\ndifference from the rest: But whether it be an essential, a specifick\ndifference or no, relates only to the complex Idea, to which\nthe name Watch is\ngiven: as long as they all agree in the Idea which that name\nstands for, and that name does not as a generical name comprehend\ndifferent Species   under it, they are\nnot essentially nor specifically different. (III.vi.39) \nOf course, this view has been challenged recently. Allison Kuklok\n(2018) argues that this watch passage does not show that Locke took\nour sorting practices (at either the phenomenal or microphysical\nlevel) to be arbitrary. For her, a mistake that interpreters of Locke\nmake is to claim that the watch passage asserts that there is no fact\nof the matter about how things should be classified, and therefore,\nour classifications are arbitrary. According to her, this watch\nanalogy is intended to show the irrelevance of hidden internal\ndifferences to species whose boundaries are antecedently drawn at the\nphenomenal level by our natural sorting practices. By her lights, once\nwe acknowledge that passages like the watch analogy do not concern\nclassification, we see that Locke never argued that classification is\narbitrary. \nOn her reading, Locke thinks that species are made by the vulgar prior\nto our theorizing about internal constitutions, and these species\ncannot plausibly be understood as the result of arbitrary\nchoice. According to Kuklok, the naturalness of our classifications\nstems from the fact that Locke holds that humans have a natural\ndisposition toward species realism, and the fact that nature presents\nus with clusters of ‘leading qualities’ that appear as\npatterns or standards. Given the vulgar realism and the leading\npatterns in nature, the vulgar classify based on non-arbitrary natural\nsimilarities. \nHowever, those who interpret the watch passage as implying\narbitrariness in classification (see Uzgalis (1988) and Jones (2010))\nwould have at least two replies. First, that ‘arbitrary’\ndoes not mean ‘random’ or that all qualities are equally\nadequate as differentia. The vulgar have good empirical\nreasons for their taxonomies, however, there are lots of similarly\ngood and natural reasons for different taxonomies. That does not imply\nthat every taxonomy is equally as acceptable. Moreover, given the\nbackground of corpuscularians who appeal to corpuscular forms as a\nground for natural kind realism, and given that Locke’s focus is\nthe internal structure and arrangement of objects, it is plausible to\nsee the watch passage as insisting that real essences are not an\nadequate foundation for a theory of natural kinds. \nAs we can see, whether, in fact, Locke employed real essences as the\nfoundations of natural kinds is currently one of the hottest debates\namong Locke scholars, and there have been a number of good studies\nwritten in recent years. \n\nThroughout the Essay, Locke discusses real essences,\ninternal constitutions and substratum, and getting clear on each\nconcept is required in order to produce a consistent and accurate\ninterpretation of Locke on real essences. While it is not\npossible to do justice to any of the subjects here, it is important to\ngive some background before proceeding. When Locke defines the\n‘real essence’, he often describes it as “that\nConstitution, whereon the Properties of these several things\ndepended” (III.iii.19). On occasion he even connects\ninternal constitutions with essences as if they were synonymous:\n“[collections of simple ideas] are therefore supposed to flow\nfrom the particular internal Constitution, or unknown Essence of that\nSubstance” (II.xxiii.3). Similarly, the concept of\n‘substance’ or ‘substratum’, i.e., pure\nsubstance in general, is conceived as an underlying ‘thing’\nwhich supports, or upholds, the properties of bodies: \n\nThe Idea then we have, to which we give the general name\nSubstance, being nothing, but the supposed, but unknown support of\nthose Qualities, we find existing, which we imagine cannot\nsubsist, sine re substante, without something to support\nthem, we call that Support Substantia; which, according to\nthe true import of the Word, is in\nplain English, standing under,\nor upholding. (II.xxiii.2) \n\nThe fact that the Essay uses internal constitutions,\nsubstance, and real essences as the underlying ground of the qualities\nof physical objects has led to some debate over the way Locke\nunderstands the relationship between the three concepts. \n\nRegarding the relationship between real essences and substance in\ngeneral, Michael Ayers has argued that Locke uses the terms\n‘substance’ and ‘real essence’ as extensionally\nequivalent, but not intensionally equivalent. That is, both terms\nrefer to the same objects, but convey a very different meaning.\nFor Ayers, Locke’s use of ‘substance’ conveys the\nidea of a thing that supports properties, whereas ‘real\nessence’ conveys the idea of a submicroscopic material structure\nthat causes the powers of the object; these are different meanings, but\nboth terms refer to only one\n object.[6] \n\nOn the other hand, some Locke scholars interpret the concepts of\n‘substance’ (in the sense of pure substance in general, or\n‘substratum’) and ‘real essence’ as both\nintensionally and extensionally distinct because they play very\ndifferent philosophical roles. For example, according to Nicholas\nJolley, Locke employs the concept of a real essence when he is\naddressing issues of scientific explanation and he appeals to\nsubstratum when he is discussing the general concept of what it is to\nbe a thing (as opposed to a property or mode) (see\nJolley 1999, pp. 70–78). \n\nOn the relationship between real essences and internal\nconstitutions, one view is that Locke uses the terms ‘real\nessence’ and ‘internal constitution’\ninterchangeably. For example, in II.xxxi.6 he says “its\nreal Essence, or internal Constitution, on which these Qualities\ndepend, can be nothing but the Figure, Size, and Connexion of its solid\nParts.” Again in III.iii.19 he uses ‘real\nessence’ as if it were synonymous with ‘internal\nconstitution’: “In all which, and the like Changes, ‘tis\nevident, their real Essence, i.e. that Constitution, whereon\nthe Properties of these several things depended, is destroy’d,\nand perishes with them.” \n\nBy contrast, Susanna Goodin (1998) argues that ‘real essence’\nand ‘internal constitution’ cannot be synonymous because,\naccording to Locke, real essences are unknowable (IV.vi.5 &\n12), but internal constitutions are knowable (II.xxiii.12). One\nway to distinguish them is, as we saw above, to adopt the relativized\nview and interpret the real essence as the internal constitution that\nunderlies the nominally essential properties, whereas the internal\nconstitution of a substance is simply its physical make-up,\nindependently of considerations of its nominal essence. So, on\nthis view, Locke’s uses of ‘real essence’ and\n‘internal constitution’ are non-synonymous technical\nterms. \n\nP. Kyle Stanford (1998), on the other hand, distinguishes real essences\nfrom internal constitutions by arguing that real essences, by\ndefinition, include the causal powers of the body, whereas the internal\nconstitution is simply its material components. Thus, for\nStanford, a real essence “consists of those features of an entity\nfrom which all of its observable or experienceable properties can be\nlogically deduced” (Stanford 1998, p. 80). By contrast, knowledge of the\ninternal constitution, qua mere material components, entails\nno such deducibility. For example, in IV.vi.11 he says that\nknowledge of the real essence of an object entails knowledge of all of\nits powers, but knowledge of mere material structure cannot entail that\nkind of knowledge. Moreover, in all the quotations where Locke\ntalks about real essences, he does not just define them as a material\nstructure, but also as the causal grounds of the observable qualities\nof the body, indicating that the powers are included in the\ndefinition. \n\nOne of Locke’s epistemological projects is to distinguish\nmetaphysics and natural philosophy from ethics and mathematics, and one\nway he does that is to distinguish their subject matters.\nMetaphysics and natural philosophy are concerned with substances,\nwhereas mathematics and ethics are concerned with modes. For\nLocke, since an essence accounts for the existence and nature of any\nbeing, i.e., “Essence may be taken for the very being of\nanything, whereby it is what it is”, it follows that the concepts\nof real and nominal essences apply outside the realm of metaphysics and\nnatural philosophy as well. By his lights, both simple ideas and\nmodes have real and nominal essences. To see this, some\ndefinitions are in order. \n\nBy ‘simple idea’, Locke means a single, uniform concept\nor appearance that cannot be analyzed into more basic parts: \n\nThe coldness and hardness, which a Man feels in a piece of\nIce, being as distinct Ideas in the Mind, as the\nSmell and Whiteness of a Lily; or as   the taste of Sugar,\nand smell of a Rose: And there is nothing can be plainer to a Man, than\nthe clear and distinct Perception he has of those simple \nIdeas; which being each in it self uncompounded, contains in\nit nothing but one uniform Appearance, or Conception in the\nmind, and is not \ndistinguishable into different Ideas. (II.ii.1) \n\nOur complex idea of gold might include its color, heaviness,\nsolidity, etc., but each of these ideas can be set aside and considered\nall on its own as a simple idea. One simple idea, e.g., that of\nthe yellowness of the lump of gold, is simple because it is a single,\nuniform appearance of that particular shade and not a collection of\nmore basic appearances. The same goes for our idea of its\nhardness and heaviness. We can mentally separate the color from\nthe hardness or heaviness and think of it all on its own. \n\nBy ‘mode’, Locke means complex ideas of qualities that\ndepend upon substances for their existence: \n \nFirst,\nModes I call such complex Ideas, which however\ncompounded, contain not in them the supposition of subsisting by\nthemselves, but are considered as Dependences on, or Affections of\nSubstances; such are the Ideas signified by the Words\nTriangle, Gratitude, Murther, etc.\n(II.xii.4) \n \nSo, for example, gratitude does not exist on its own,\nrather it requires a thing that is grateful in order to\nexist. Mixed modes are, \n\nthe Complex Ideas, we mark by the names Obligation,\nDrunkenness, a Lye, etc. which consisting of several\nCombinations of simple Ideas of   different kinds,\nI have called Mixed Modes, to distinguish them from the more\nsimple Modes, which consist only of simple Ideas of the same\n kind. These mixed Modes being also such Combinations of simple\nIdeas, as are not looked upon to be the characteristical Marks\nof any real   Beings that have a steady existence, but\nscattered and independent Ideas, put together by the Mind, are\nthereby distinguished from the complex Ideas of Substances.\n(II.xxii.1) \n\nGiven that there are real and nominal essences for modes and that a\ngeneral knowledge consists in knowledge of essences, then Locke needs\nsome way to distinguish the essences of modes from those of\nsubstances. \n\nAccording to Locke, one of the main differences between substances\non the one hand and simple ideas and modes on the other is that the\nreal essences of substances are distinct from their nominal essences,\nwhereas for simple ideas and modes, they are the same. \n\nEssences being thus distinguished into Nominal and\nReal, we may farther observe, that in the Species of\nsimple Ideas and Modes, they are always the\nsame: But in Substances, always quite different. Thus a\nFigure including a Space between three Lines, is the real, as well as\nnominal Essence of a Triangle; it being not only the\nabstract Idea to which the general Name is annexed, but the\nvery Essentia, or Being, of the thing it self, that\nFoundation from which all its Properties flow, and to which they are\nall inseparably annexed. But it is far otherwise concerning that\nparcel of Matter, which makes the Ring on my Finger, wherein these\ntwo Essences are apparently different. For it is the real\nConstitution of its insensible Parts, on which depend all those\nproperties of Colour, Weight, Fusibility, Fixedness, etc.\nwhich are to be found in it. Which Constitution we know not; and so\nhaving no particular\nIdea of, have no Name that is the Sign of it. But yet it is\nits Colour, Weight, Fusibility, and Fixedness, etc.\n which makes it to be\nGold, or gives it a right to that Name, which is therefore its\nnominal Essence. (III.iii.18) \n\nSo the real essences of a triangle, or gratitude, or murder, or\nyellow, or sweet, etc., are exactly the same as their nominal\nessences. There is nothing more to being a triangle than being a\nplane, closed three-sided figure. Similarly, there is nothing\nmore to being a particular ‘species’ or shade of yellow\nthan the nominal\n definition.[7] \n\nWhile it is clear that Locke envisioned some analogy between the\nreal and nominal essences of substances with those of modes, it is\nunclear, however, just how that analogy should be cashed out. For\nexample, Roger Woolhouse  argues that it is a mistake for Locke to say\nthat mode ideas have a real essence at all because there is nothing\nlike a corpuscular structure that is analogous to the definition of a\nconcept like triangle or lying. Moreover, there is, according to\nWoolhouse, nothing that binds the nominally essential qualities of\nmodes together, whereas, for substances there is an underlying physical\nstructure (see Woolhouse 1971, pp. 125–128). Indeed it is quite\ndifficult to see how a mode could have a real essence if the model for\nwhat a real essence is comes from corpuscular structures. If\nWoolhouse is right, then Locke has no way to make good on his intended\nanalogy and he is unable to adequately differentiate modes from\nsubstances. \n\nP. Kyle Stanford (1998), on the other hand, suggests that the analogy\nbetween real and nominal essences was intended to be based in their\nentailment relations. Stanford argues that, just as every\nproperty of a substance flows from the real essence with geometrical\nnecessity (IV.vi.11), so too does every property of a triangle follow\nfrom its definition with geometrical necessity. And this fact is\nwhat all real and nominal essences have in common for Locke. By\nhis way of thinking, even though the connection between the real\nessence of a piece of gold is the causal ground of the\nnominally essential properties of gold, and the real essence of a\ntriangle is the logical ground for the nominally essential\nproperties of a triangle, they are alike in that all nominally\nessential properties can be deduced from the idea of the real essence;\nif we knew the real essence of a triangle, then we could deduce from it\nany of the properties of a triangle. To make this analogy work,\nStanford argues that the real essence of a substance is more than a\ncorpuscular structure, it must also include the causal powers that\nproduce the observable qualities of the substance; in like fashion, the\nreal essence of modes includes the logical ground from which the\nnominally essential properties of the term flow. If Stanford is\ncorrect, then there is a possible analogy between the real and nominal\nessences of modes and substances that yields an interesting\ninterpretation of the real essences of both modes and substances. \n\nOn either reading, however, it appears that Locke is saddled with\nthe view that in cases of simple ideas, ideas of modes and mixed modes,\nif we understand the meanings of the words, we know all that there is\nto know regarding those concepts. Moral and mathematical concepts\nand ideas are mere trifling propositions, analytic truths and\nuninformative. However, it will be difficult for many moral\nphilosophers to accept that all they are doing is cashing out the\ndefinitions of terms and dealing with uninformative analytic truths;\nasserting that lying is wrong seems to be more than a trifling\nopinion. Moreover, it is unclear how Locke thinks moral terms can\nbe normative, i.e., how they can constitute commands we ought to\nobey—if his position is correct. \n\nIn a similar vein, since many mixed modes, which include all moral\nconcepts, are arbitrary mental constructs, it follows that we create\nmoral concepts by producing their definitions. Since the real and\nnominal essences of mixed modes are the same, it follows that if we\nknow the real essence of lying (knowingly and falsely asserting that\n‘p’ with the intention to mislead someone whom we\nought not to mislead, etc.), we can deduce from that idea all the\ncomponents of lying, and so there is nothing more to know about lying\nthan the ideas contained within its definition. A problem with Locke’s\naccount here is that, as John Mackie points out, social scientists\nseek out the real essences of social phenomena such as adultery,\nincest, jealousy, lying and suicide, but understanding these complex\nphenomena involves more than simply understanding the meaning of the\nword.  If we are to understand why people lie, we must know more than\na definition of lying. Of course, it is possible for Locke to argue\nthat once we understand all that is included in lying, we have\nuncovered its real essence, why people lie, and the many ways they do\nso, however, are separate questions that we cannot expect to be\ndecided by a semantic theory. It is unclear how he would solve the\nnormative problem (see Mackie 1976, pp. 90–91; see also Jolley\n1999, pp.  155–161).","contact.mail":"je.jones@svu.edu","contact.domain":"svu.edu"}]
