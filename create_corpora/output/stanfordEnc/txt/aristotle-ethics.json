Its methodology must match its subject\nmatter—good action—and must respect the fact that in this\nfield many generalizations hold only for the most part. We study\nethics in order to improve our lives, and therefore its principal\nconcern is the nature of human well-being. Aristotle follows Socrates\nand Plato in taking the virtues to be central to a well-lived life.\nLike Plato, he regards the ethical virtues (justice, courage,\ntemperance and so on) as complex rational, emotional and social\nskills. But he rejects Plato's idea that to be completely virtuous one\nmust acquire, through a training in the sciences, mathematics, and\nphilosophy, an understanding of what goodness is. What we need, in\norder to live well, is a proper appreciation of the way in which such\ngoods as friendship, pleasure, virtue, honor and wealth fit together\nas a whole. In order to apply that general understanding to particular\ncases, we must acquire, through proper upbringing and habits, the\nability to see, on each occasion, which course of action is best\nsupported by reasons. Therefore practical wisdom, as he conceives it,\ncannot be acquired solely by learning general rules. We must also\nacquire, through practice, those deliberative, emotional, and social\nskills that enable us to put our general understanding of well-being\ninto practice in ways that are suitable to each occasion.\n\nAristotle wrote two ethical treatises: the Nicomachean Ethics\nand the Eudemian Ethics. He does not himself use either of\nthese titles, although in the Politics (1295a36) he refers\nback to one of them—probably the Eudemian\nEthics—as “ta êthika”—his\nwritings about character. The words “Eudemian”\nand “Nicomachean” were added later, perhaps\nbecause the former was edited by his friend, Eudemus, and the latter\nby his son, Nicomachus. In any case, these two works cover more or\nless the same ground: they begin with a discussion of\neudaimonia (“happiness”,\n“flourishing”), and turn to an examination of the nature\nof aretê (“virtue”, “excellence”)\nand the character traits that human beings need in order to live life\nat its best. Both treatises examine the conditions in which praise or\nblame are appropriate, and the nature of pleasure and friendship; near\nthe end of each work, we find a brief discussion of the proper\nrelationship between human beings and the divine. \nThough the general point of view expressed in each work is the same,\nthere are many subtle differences in organization and content as well.\nClearly, one is a re-working of the other, and although no single\npiece of evidence shows conclusively what their order is, it is widely\nassumed that the Nicomachean Ethics is a later and improved\nversion of the Eudemian Ethics. (Not all of the Eudemian\nEthics was revised: its Books IV, V, and VI re-appear as V, VI,\nVII of the Nicomachean Ethics.) Perhaps the most telling\nindication of this ordering is that in several instances the\nNicomachean Ethics develops a theme about which its\nEudemian cousin is silent. Only the Nicomachean\nEthics discusses the close relationship between ethical inquiry\nand politics; only the Nicomachean Ethics critically examines\nSolon's paradoxical dictum that no man should be counted happy until\nhe is dead; and only the Nicomachean Ethics gives a series of\narguments for the superiority of the philosophical life to the\npolitical life. The remainder of this article will therefore focus on\nthis work. [Note: Page and line numbers shall henceforth refer to this\ntreatise.] \nA third treatise, called the Magna Moralia (the “Big\nEthics”)is included in complete editions of Aristotle's works,\nbut its authorship is disputed by scholars. It ranges over topics\ndiscussed more fully in the other two works and its point of view is\nsimilar to theirs. (Why, being briefer, is it named the Magna\nMoralia? Because each of the two papyrus rolls into which it is\ndivided is unusually long. Just as a big mouse can be a small animal,\ntwo big chapters can make a small book. This work was evidently named\n“big” with reference to its parts, not the whole.) A few\nauthors in antiquity refer to a work with this name and attribute it\nto Aristotle, but it is not mentioned by several authorities, such as\nCicero and Diogenes Laertius, whom we would expect to have known of\nit. Some scholars hold that it is Aristotle's earliest course on\nethics—perhaps his own lecture notes or those of a student;\nothers regard it as a post-Aristotelian compilation or adaption of one\nor both of his genuine ethical treatises. \nAlthough Aristotle is deeply indebted to Plato's moral philosophy,\nparticularly Plato's central insight that moral thinking must be\nintegrated with our emotions and appetites, and that the preparation\nfor such unity of character should begin with childhood education, the\nsystematic character of Aristotle's discussion of these themes was a\nremarkable innovation. No one had written ethical treatises before\nAristotle. Plato's Republic, for example, does not treat\nethics as a distinct subject matter; nor does it offer a systematic\nexamination of the nature of happiness, virtue, voluntariness,\npleasure, or friendship. To be sure, we can find in Plato's works\nimportant discussions of these phenomena, but they are not brought\ntogether and unified as they are in Aristotle's ethical writings. \nThe principal idea with which Aristotle begins is that there are\ndifferences of opinion about what is best for human beings, and that\nto profit from ethical inquiry we must resolve this disagreement. He\ninsists that ethics is not a theoretical discipline: we are asking\nwhat the good for human beings is not simply because we want to have\nknowledge, but because we will be better able to achieve our good if\nwe develop a fuller understanding of what it is to flourish. In\nraising this question—what is the good?—Aristotle is not\nlooking for a list of items that are good. He assumes that such a list\ncan be compiled rather easily; most would agree, for example, that it\nis good to have friends, to experience pleasure, to be healthy, to be\nhonored, and to have such virtues as courage at least to some degree.\nThe difficult and controversial question arises when we ask whether\ncertain of these goods are more desirable than others. Aristotle's\nsearch for the good is a search for the highest\ngood, and he assumes that the highest good, whatever it turns out to\nbe, has three characteristics: it is desirable for itself, it is not\ndesirable for the sake of some other good, and all other goods are\ndesirable for its sake. \nAristotle thinks everyone will agree that the terms\n“eudaimonia” (“happiness”) and\n“eu zên” (“living well”) designate\nsuch an end. The Greek term “eudaimon” is\ncomposed of two parts: “eu” means\n“well” and “daimon” means\n“divinity” or “spirit”. To be\neudaimon is therefore to be living in a way that is\nwell-favored by a god. But Aristotle never calls attention to this\netymology in his ethical writings, and it seems to have little\ninfluence on his thinking. He regards “eudaimon”\nas a mere substitute for eu zên (“living well”).\nThese terms play an evaluative role, and are not simply descriptions\nof someone's state of mind. \nNo one tries to live well for the sake of some further goal; rather,\nbeing eudaimon is the highest end, and all\nsubordinate goals—health, wealth, and other such\nresources—are sought because they promote well-being, not\nbecause they are what well-being consists in. But unless we can\ndetermine which good or goods happiness consists in, it is of little\nuse to acknowledge that it is the highest end. To resolve this issue,\nAristotle asks what the ergon (“function”,\n“task”, “work”) of a human being is, and\nargues that it consists in activity of the rational part of the soul\nin accordance with virtue (1097b22–1098a20). One important\ncomponent of this argument is expressed in terms of distinctions he\nmakes in his psychological and biological works. The soul is analyzed\ninto a connected series of capacities: the nutritive soul is\nresponsible for growth and reproduction, the locomotive soul for\nmotion, the perceptive soul for perception, and so on. The biological\nfact Aristotle makes use of is that human beings are the only species\nthat has not only these lower capacities but a rational soul as well.\nThe good of a human being must have something to do with being human;\nand what sets humanity off from other species, giving us the potential\nto live a better life, is our capacity to guide ourselves by using\nreason. If we use reason well, we live well as human beings; or, to be\nmore precise, using reason well over the course of a full life is what\nhappiness consists in. Doing anything well requires virtue or\nexcellence, and therefore living well consists in activities caused by\nthe rational soul in accordance with virtue or excellence. \nAristotle's conclusion about the nature of happiness is in a sense\nuniquely his own. No other writer or thinker had said precisely what\nhe says about what it is to live well. But at the same time his view\nis not too distant from a common idea. As he himself points out, one\ntraditional conception of happiness identifies it with virtue\n(1098b30–1). Aristotle's theory should be construed as a\nrefinement of this position. He says, not that happiness is virtue,\nbut that it is virtuous activity. Living well consists in\ndoing something, not just being in a certain state or condition. It\nconsists in those lifelong activities that actualize the virtues of\nthe rational part of the soul. \nAt the same time, Aristotle makes it clear that in order to be happy\none must possess others goods as well—such goods as friends,\nwealth, and power. And one's happiness is endangered if one is\nseverely lacking in certain advantages—if, for example, one is\nextremely ugly, or has lost children or good friends through death\n(1099a31–b6). But why so? If one's ultimate end should simply be\nvirtuous activity, then why should it make any difference to one's\nhappiness whether one has or lacks these other types of good?\nAristotle's reply is that one's virtuous activity will be to some\nextent diminished or defective, if one lacks an adequate supply of\nother goods (1153b17–19). Someone who is friendless, childless,\npowerless, weak, and ugly will simply not be able to find many\nopportunities for virtuous activity over a long period of time, and\nwhat little he can accomplish will not be of great merit. To some\nextent, then, living well requires good fortune; happenstance can rob\neven the most excellent human beings of happiness. Nonetheless,\nAristotle insists, the highest good, virtuous activity, is not\nsomething that comes to us by chance. Although we must be fortunate\nenough to have parents and fellow citizens who help us become\nvirtuous, we ourselves share much of the responsibility for acquiring\nand exercising the virtues. \nA common complaint about Aristotle's attempt to defend his conception\nof happiness is that his argument is too general to show that it is in\none's interest to possess any of the particular virtues as they are\ntraditionally conceived. Suppose we grant, at least for the sake of\nargument, that doing anything well, including living well, consists in\nexercising certain skills; and let us call these skills, whatever they\nturn out to be, virtues. Even so, that point does not by itself allow\nus to infer that such qualities as temperance, justice, courage, as\nthey are normally understood, are virtues. They should be counted as\nvirtues only if it can be shown that actualizing precisely these\nskills is what happiness consists in. What Aristotle owes us, then, is\nan account of these traditional qualities that explains why they must\nplay a central role in any well-lived life. \nBut perhaps Aristotle disagrees, and refuses to accept this\nargumentative burden. In one of several important methodological\nremarks he makes near the beginning of the Nicomachean\nEthics, he says that in order to profit from the sort of study he\nis undertaking, one must already have been brought up in good habits\n(1095b4–6). The audience he is addressing, in other words,\nconsists of people who are already just, courageous, and generous; or,\nat any rate, they are well on their way to possessing these virtues.\nWhy such a restricted audience? Why does he not address those who have\nserious doubts about the value of these traditional qualities, and who\ntherefore have not yet decided to cultivate and embrace them? \nAddressing the moral skeptic, after all, is the project Plato\nundertook in the Republic: in Book I he rehearses an argument\nto show that justice is not really a virtue, and the remainder of this\nwork is an attempt to rebut this thesis. Aristotle's project seems, at\nleast on the surface, to be quite different. He does not appear to be\naddressing someone who has genuine doubts about the value of justice\nor kindred qualities. Perhaps, then, he realizes how little can be\naccomplished, in the study of ethics, to provide it with a rational\nfoundation. Perhaps he thinks that no reason can be given for being\njust, generous, and courageous. These are qualities one learns to love\nwhen one is a child, and having been properly habituated, one no\nlonger looks for or needs a reason to exercise them. One can show, as\na general point, that happiness consists in exercising some skills or\nother, but that the moral skills of a virtuous person are what one\nneeds is not a proposition that can be established on the basis of\nargument. \nThis is not the only way of reading the Ethics, however. For\nsurely we cannot expect Aristotle to show what it is about the\ntraditional virtues that makes them so worthwhile until he has fully\ndiscussed the nature of those virtues. He himself warns us that his\ninitial statement of what happiness is should be treated as a rough\noutline whose details are to be filled in later (1098a20–22).\nHis intention in Book I of the Ethics is to indicate in a\ngeneral way why the virtues are important; why particular\nvirtues—courage, justice, and the like—are components of\nhappiness is something we should be able to better understand only at\na later point. \nIn any case, Aristotle's assertion that his audience must already have\nbegun to cultivate the virtues need not be taken to mean that no\nreasons can be found for being courageous, just, and generous. His\npoint, rather, may be that in ethics, as in any other study, we cannot\nmake progress towards understanding why things are as they are unless\nwe begin with certain assumptions about what is the case. Neither\ntheoretical nor practical inquiry starts from scratch. Someone who has\nmade no observations of astronomical or biological phenomena is not\nyet equipped with sufficient data to develop an understanding of these\nsciences. The parallel point in ethics is that to make progress in\nthis sphere we must already have come to enjoy doing what is just,\ncourageous, generous and the like. We must experience these activities\nnot as burdensome constraints, but as noble, worthwhile, and enjoyable\nin themselves. Then, when we engage in ethical inquiry, we can ask\nwhat it is about these activities that makes them worthwhile. We can\nalso compare these goods with other things that are desirable in\nthemselves—pleasure, friendship, honor, and so on—and ask\nwhether any of them is more desirable than the others. We approach\nethical theory with a disorganized bundle of likes and dislikes based\non habit and experience; such disorder is an inevitable feature of\nchildhood. But what is not inevitable is that our early experience\nwill be rich enough to provide an adequate basis for worthwhile\nethical reflection; that is why we need to have been brought up well.\nYet such an upbringing can take us only so far. We seek a deeper\nunderstanding of the objects of our childhood enthusiasms, and we must\nsystematize our goals so that as adults we have a coherent plan of\nlife. We need to engage in ethical theory, and to reason well in this\nfield, if we are to move beyond the low-grade form of virtue we\nacquired as children. \nRead in this way, Aristotle is engaged in a project similar in some\nrespects to the one Plato carried out in the Republic. One of\nPlato's central points is that it is a great advantage to establish a\nhierarchical ordering of the elements in one's soul; and he shows how\nthe traditional virtues can be interpreted to foster or express the\nproper relation between reason and less rational elements of the\npsyche. Aristotle's approach is similar: his “function\nargument” shows in a general way that our good lies in the\ndominance of reason, and the detailed studies of the particular\nvirtues reveal how each of them involves the right kind of ordering of\nthe soul. Aristotle's goal is to arrive at conclusions like Plato's,\nbut without relying on the Platonic metaphysics that plays a central\nrole in the argument of the Republic. He rejects the\nexistence of Plato's forms in general and the form of the good in\nparticular; and he rejects the idea that in order to become fully\nvirtuous one must study mathematics and the sciences, and see all\nbranches of knowledge as a unified whole. Even though Aristotle's\nethical theory sometimes relies on philosophical distinctions that are\nmore fully developed in his other works, he never proposes that\nstudents of ethics need to engage in a specialized study of the\nnatural world, or mathematics, or eternal and changing objects. His\nproject is to make ethics an autonomous field, and to show why a full\nunderstanding of what is good does not require expertise in any other\nfield. \nThere is another contrast with Plato that should be emphasized: In\nBook II of the Republic, we are told that the best type of\ngood is one that is desirable both in itself and for the sake of its\nresults (357d-358a). Plato argues that justice should be placed in\nthis category, but since it is generally agreed that it is desirable\nfor its consequences, he devotes most of his time to establishing his\nmore controversial point—that justice is to be sought for its\nown sake. By contrast, Aristotle assumes that if A is desirable\nfor the sake of B, then B is better than A\n(1094a14–16); therefore, the highest kind of good must be one\nthat is not desirable for the sake of anything else. To show that\nA deserves to be our ultimate end, one must show that all other\ngoods are best thought of as instruments that promote A in some\nway or other. Accordingly, it would not serve Aristotle's purpose to\nconsider virtuous activity in isolation from all other goods. He needs\nto discuss honor, wealth, pleasure, and friendship in order to show\nhow these goods, properly understood, can be seen as resources that\nserve the higher goal of virtuous activity. He vindicates the\ncentrality of virtue in a well-lived life by showing that in the\nnormal course of things a virtuous person will not live a life devoid\nof friends, honor, wealth, pleasure, and the like. Virtuous activity\nmakes a life happy not by guaranteeing happiness in all circumstances,\nbut by serving as the goal for the sake of which lesser goods are to\nbe pursued. Aristotle's methodology in ethics therefore pays more\nattention than does Plato's to the connections that normally obtain\nbetween virtue and other goods. That is why he stresses that in this\nsort of study one must be satisfied with conclusions that hold only\nfor the most part (1094b11–22). Poverty, isolation, and dishonor\nare normally impediments to the exercise of virtue and therefore to\nhappiness, although there may be special circumstances in which they\nare not. The possibility of exceptions does not undermine the point\nthat, as a rule, to live well is to have sufficient resources for the\npursuit of virtue over the course of a lifetime. \nAristotle distinguishes two kinds of virtue (1103a1–10): those\nthat pertain to the part of the soul that engages in reasoning\n(virtues of mind or intellect), and those that pertain to the part of\nthe soul that cannot itself reason but is nonetheless capable of\nfollowing reason (ethical virtues, virtues of character). Intellectual\nvirtues are in turn divided into two sorts: those that pertain to\ntheoretical reasoning, and those that pertain to practical thinking\n1139a3–8). He organizes his material by first studying ethical\nvirtue in general, then moving to a discussion of particular ethical\nvirtues (temperance, courage, and so on), and finally completing his\nsurvey by considering the intellectual virtues (practical wisdom,\ntheoretical wisdom, etc.). \nAll free males are born with the potential to become ethically\nvirtuous and practically wise, but to achieve these goals they must go\nthrough two stages: during their childhood, they must develop the\nproper habits; and then, when their reason is fully developed, they\nmust acquire practical wisdom (phronêsis). This does not\nmean that first we fully acquire the ethical virtues, and then, at a\nlater stage, add on practical wisdom. Ethical virtue is fully\ndeveloped only when it is combined with practical wisdom\n(1144b14–17). A low-grade form of ethical virtue emerges in us\nduring childhood as we are repeatedly placed in situations that call\nfor appropriate actions and emotions; but as we rely less on others\nand become capable of doing more of our own thinking, we learn to\ndevelop a larger picture of human life, our deliberative skills\nimprove, and our emotional responses are perfected. Like anyone who\nhas developed a skill in performing a complex and difficult activity,\nthe virtuous person takes pleasure in exercising his intellectual\nskills. Furthermore, when he has decided what to do, he does not have\nto contend with internal pressures to act otherwise. He does not long\nto do something that he regards as shameful; and he is not greatly\ndistressed at having to give up a pleasure that he realizes he should\nforego. \nAristotle places those who suffer from such internal disorders into\none of three categories: (A) Some agents, having reached a decision\nabout what to do on a particular occasion, experience some\ncounter-pressure brought on by an appetite for pleasure, or anger, or\nsome other emotion; and this countervailing influence is not\ncompletely under the control of reason. (1) Within this category, some\nare typically better able to resist these counter-rational pressures\nthan is the average person. Such people are not virtuous, although\nthey generally do what a virtuous person does. Aristotle calls them\n“continent” (enkratês). But (2) others are less\nsuccessful than the average person in resisting these\ncounter-pressures. They are “incontinent”\n(akratês). (The explanation of akrasia is a topic\nto which we will return in section 7.) In addition, (B) there is a\ntype of agent who refuses even to try to do what an ethically virtuous\nagent would do, because he has become convinced that justice,\ntemperance, generosity and the like are of little or no value. Such\npeople Aristotle calls evil (kakos, phaulos). He\nassumes that evil people are driven by desires for domination and\nluxury, and although they are single-minded in their pursuit of these\ngoals, he portrays them as deeply divided, because their\npleonexia—their desire for more and more—leaves\nthem dissatisfied and full of self-hatred. \nIt should be noticed that all three of these\ndeficiencies—continence, incontinence, vice—involve some\nlack of internal harmony. (Here Aristotle's debt to Plato is\nparticularly evident, for one of the central ideas of the\nRepublic is that the life of a good person is harmonious, and\nall other lives deviate to some degree from this ideal.) The evil\nperson may wholeheartedly endorse some evil plan of action at a\nparticular moment, but over the course of time, Aristotle supposes, he\nwill regret his decision, because whatever he does will prove\ninadequate for the achievement of his goals (1166b5–29).\nAristotle assumes that when someone systematically makes bad decisions\nabout how to live his life, his failures are caused by psychological\nforces that are less than fully rational. His desires for pleasure,\npower or some other external goal have become so strong that they make\nhim care too little or not at all about acting ethically. To keep such\ndestructive inner forces at bay, we need to develop the proper habits\nand emotional responses when we are children, and to reflect\nintelligently on our aims when we are adults. But some vulnerability\nto these disruptive forces is present even in more-or-less virtuous\npeople; that is why even a good political community needs laws and the\nthreat of punishment. Clear thinking about the best goals of human\nlife and the proper way to put them into practice is a rare\nachievement, because the human psyche is not a hospitable environment\nfor the development of these insights. \nAristotle describes ethical virtue as a “hexis”\n(“state” “condition”\n“disposition”)—a tendency or disposition, induced by\nour habits, to have appropriate feelings (1105b25–6). Defective\nstates of character are hexeis (plural of hexis) as\nwell, but they are tendencies to have inappropriate feelings. The\nsignificance of Aristotle's characterization of these states as\nhexeis is his decisive rejection of the thesis, found\nthroughout Plato's early dialogues, that virtue is nothing but a kind\nof knowledge and vice nothing but a lack of knowledge. Although\nAristotle frequently draws analogies between the crafts and the\nvirtues (and similarly between physical health and\neudaimonia), he insists that the virtues differ from the\ncrafts and all branches of knowledge in that the former involve\nappropriate emotional responses and are not purely intellectual\nconditions. \nFurthermore, every ethical virtue is a condition intermediate (a\n“golden mean” as it is popularly known) between two other\nstates, one involving excess, and the other deficiency\n(1106a26–b28). In this respect, Aristotle says, the virtues are\nno different from technical skills: every skilled worker knows how to\navoid excess and deficiency, and is in a condition intermediate\nbetween two extremes. The courageous person, for example, judges that\nsome dangers are worth facing and others not, and experiences fear to\na degree that is appropriate to his circumstances. He lies between the\ncoward, who flees every danger and experiences excessive fear, and the\nrash person, who judges every danger worth facing and experiences\nlittle or no fear. Aristotle holds that this same topography applies\nto every ethical virtue: all are located on a map that places the\nvirtues between states of excess and deficiency. He is careful to add,\nhowever, that the mean is to be determined in a way that takes into\naccount the particular circumstances of the individual\n(1106a36–b7). The arithmetic mean between 10 and 2 is 6, and\nthis is so invariably, whatever is being counted. But the intermediate\npoint that is chosen by an expert in any of the crafts will vary from\none situation to another. There is no universal rule, for example,\nabout how much food an athlete should eat, and it would be absurd to\ninfer from the fact that 10 lbs. is too much and 2 lbs. too little for\nme that I should eat 6 lbs. Finding the mean in any given situation is\nnot a mechanical or thoughtless procedure, but requires a full and\ndetailed acquaintance with the circumstances. \nIt should be evident that Aristotle's treatment of virtues as mean\nstates endorses the idea that we should sometimes have strong\nfeelings—when such feelings are called for by our situation.\nSometimes only a small degree of anger is appropriate; but at other\ntimes, circumstances call for great anger. The right amount is not\nsome quantity between zero and the highest possible level, but rather\nthe amount, whatever it happens to be, that is proportionate to the\nseriousness of the situation. Of course, Aristotle is committed to\nsaying that anger should never reach the point at which it undermines\nreason; and this means that our passion should always fall short of\nthe extreme point at which we would lose control. But it is possible\nto be very angry without going to this extreme, and Aristotle does not\nintend to deny this. \nThe theory of the mean is open to several objections, but before\nconsidering them, we should recognize that in fact there are two\ndistinct theses each of which might be called a doctrine of the mean.\nFirst, there is the thesis that every virtue is a state that lies\nbetween two vices, one of excess and the other of deficiency. Second,\nthere is the idea that whenever a virtuous person chooses to perform a\nvirtuous act, he can be described as aiming at an act that is in some\nway or other intermediate between alternatives that he rejects. It is\nthis second thesis that is most likely to be found objectionable. A\ncritic might concede that in some cases virtuous acts can be described\nin Aristotle's terms. If, for example, one is trying to decide how\nmuch to spend on a wedding present, one is looking for an amount that\nis neither excessive nor deficient. But surely many other problems\nthat confront a virtuous agent are not susceptible to this\nquantitative analysis. If one must decide whether to attend a wedding\nor respect a competing obligation instead, it would not be\nilluminating to describe this as a search for a mean between\nextremes—unless “aiming at the mean” simply becomes\nanother phrase for trying to make the right decision. The objection,\nthen, is that Aristotle's doctrine of the mean, taken as a doctrine\nabout what the ethical agent does when he deliberates, is in many\ncases inapplicable or unilluminating. \nA defense of Aristotle would have to say that the virtuous person does\nafter all aim at a mean, if we allow for a broad enough notion of what\nsort of aiming is involved. For example, consider a juror who must\ndetermine whether a defendant is guilty as charged. He does not have\nbefore his mind a quantitative question; he is trying to decide\nwhether the accused committed the crime, and is not looking for some\nquantity of action intermediate between extremes. Nonetheless, an\nexcellent juror can be described as someone who, in trying to arrive\nat the correct decision, seeks to express the right degree of concern\nfor all relevant considerations. He searches for the verdict that\nresults from a deliberative process that is neither overly credulous\nnor unduly skeptical. Similarly, in facing situations that arouse\nanger, a virtuous agent must determine what action (if any) to take in\nresponse to an insult, and although this is not itself a quantitative\nquestion, his attempt to answer it properly requires him to have the\nright degree of concern for his standing as a member of the community.\nHe aims at a mean in the sense that he looks for a response that\navoids too much or too little attention to factors that must be taken\ninto account in making a wise decision. \nPerhaps a greater difficulty can be raised if we ask how Aristotle\ndetermines which emotions are governed by the doctrine of the mean.\nConsider someone who loves to wrestle, for example. Is this passion\nsomething that must be felt by every human being at appropriate times\nand to the right degree? Surely someone who never felt this emotion to\nany degree could still live a perfectly happy life. Why then should we\nnot say the same about at least some of the emotions that Aristotle\nbuilds into his analysis of the ethically virtuous agent? Why should\nwe experience anger at all, or fear, or the degree of concern for\nwealth and honor that Aristotle commends? These are precisely the\nquestions that were asked in antiquity by the Stoics, and they came to\nthe conclusion that such common emotions as anger and fear are always\ninappropriate. Aristotle assumes, on the contrary, not simply that\nthese common passions are sometimes appropriate, but that it is\nessential that every human being learn how to master them and\nexperience them in the right way at the right times. A defense of his\nposition would have to show that the emotions that figure in his\naccount of the virtues are valuable components of any well-lived human\nlife, when they are experienced properly. Perhaps such a project could\nbe carried out, but Aristotle himself does not attempt to do so. \nHe often says, in the course of his discussion, that when the good\nperson chooses to act virtuously, he does so for the sake of the\n“kalon”—a word that can mean\n“beautiful”, “noble”, or “fine”\n(see for example 1120a23–4). This term indicates that Aristotle\nsees in ethical activity an attraction that is comparable to the\nbeauty of well-crafted artifacts, including such artifacts as poetry,\nmusic, and drama. He draws this analogy in his discussion of the mean,\nwhen he says that every craft tries to produce a work from which\nnothing should be taken away and to which nothing further should be\nadded (1106b5–14). A craft product, when well designed and\nproduced by a good craftsman, is not merely useful, but also has such\nelements as balance, proportion and harmony—for these are\nproperties that help make it useful. Similarly, Aristotle holds that a\nwell-executed project that expresses the ethical virtues will not\nmerely be advantageous but kalon as well—for the\nbalance it strikes is part of what makes it advantageous. The young\nperson learning to acquire the virtues must develop a love of doing\nwhat is kalon and a strong aversion to its opposite—the\naischron, the shameful and ugly. Determining what is\nkalon is difficult (1106b28–33, 1109a24–30), and\nthe normal human aversion to embracing difficulties helps account for\nthe scarcity of virtue (1104b10–11). \nIt should be clear that neither the thesis that virtues lie between\nextremes nor the thesis that the good person aims at what is\nintermediate is intended as a procedure for making decisions. These\ndoctrines of the mean help show what is attractive about the virtues,\nand they also help systematize our understanding of which qualities\nare virtues. Once we see that temperance, courage, and other generally\nrecognized characteristics are mean states, we are in a position to\ngeneralize and to identify other mean states as virtues, even though\nthey are not qualities for which we have a name. Aristotle remarks,\nfor example, that the mean state with respect to anger has no name in\nGreek (1125b26–7). Though he is guided to some degree by\ndistinctions captured by ordinary terms, his methodology allows him to\nrecognize states for which no names exist. \nSo far from offering a decision procedure, Aristotle insists that this\nis something that no ethical theory can do. His theory elucidates the\nnature of virtue, but what must be done on any particular occasion by\na virtuous agent depends on the circumstances, and these vary so much\nfrom one occasion to another that there is no possibility of stating a\nseries of rules, however complicated, that collectively solve every\npractical problem. This feature of ethical theory is not unique;\nAristotle thinks it applies to many crafts, such as medicine and\nnavigation (1104a7–10). He says that the virtuous person\n“sees the truth in each case, being as it were a standard and\nmeasure of them” (1113a32–3); but this appeal to the good\nperson's vision should not be taken to mean that he has an\ninarticulate and incommunicable insight into the truth. Aristotle\nthinks of the good person as someone who is good at deliberation, and\nhe describes deliberation as a process of rational inquiry. The\nintermediate point that the good person tries to find is  \ndetermined by logos (“reason”,\n“account”) and in the way that the person of practical\nreason would determine it. (1107a1–2)  \nTo say that such a person “sees” what to do is simply a\nway of registering the point that the good person's reasoning does\nsucceed in discovering what is best in each situation. He is “as\nit were a standard and measure” in the sense that his views\nshould be regarded as authoritative by other members of the community.\nA standard or measure is something that settles disputes; and because\ngood people are so skilled at discovering the mean in difficult cases,\ntheir advice must be sought and heeded. \nAlthough there is no possibility of writing a book of rules, however\nlong, that will serve as a complete guide to wise decision-making, it\nwould be a mistake to attribute to Aristotle the opposite position,\nnamely that every purported rule admits of exceptions, so that even a\nsmall rule-book that applies to a limited number of situations is an\nimpossibility. He makes it clear that certain emotions (spite,\nshamelessness, envy) and actions (adultery, theft, murder) are always\nwrong, regardless of the circumstances (1107a8–12). Although he\nsays that the names of these emotions and actions convey their\nwrongness, he should not be taken to mean that their wrongness derives\nfrom linguistic usage. He defends the family as a social institution\nagainst the criticisms of Plato (Politics II.3–4), and\nso when he says that adultery is always wrong, he is prepared to argue\nfor his point by explaining why marriage is a valuable custom and why\nextra-marital intercourse undermines the relationship between husband\nand wife. He is not making the tautological claim that wrongful sexual\nactivity is wrong, but the more specific and contentious point that\nmarriages ought to be governed by a rule of strict fidelity.\nSimilarly, when he says that murder and theft are always wrong, he\ndoes not mean that wrongful killing and taking are wrong, but that the\ncurrent system of laws regarding these matters ought to be strictly\nenforced. So, although Aristotle holds that ethics cannot be reduced\nto a system of rules, however complex, he insists that some rules are\ninviolable. \nWe have seen that the decisions of a practically wise person are not\nmere intuitions, but can be justified by a chain of reasoning. (This\nis why Aristotle often talks in term of a practical syllogism, with a\nmajor premise that identifies some good to be achieved, and a minor\npremise that locates the good in some present-to-hand situation.) At\nthe same time, he is acutely aware of the fact that reasoning can\nalways be traced back to a starting point that is not itself justified\nby further reasoning. Neither good theoretical reasoning nor good\npractical reasoning moves in a circle; true thinking always\npresupposes and progresses in linear fashion from proper starting\npoints. And that leads him to ask for an account of how the proper\nstarting points of reasoning are to be determined. Practical reasoning\nalways presupposes that one has some end, some goal one is trying to\nachieve; and the task of reasoning is to determine how that goal is to\nbe accomplished. (This need not be means-end reasoning in the\nconventional sense; if, for example, our goal is the just resolution\nof a conflict, we must determine what constitutes justice in these\nparticular circumstances. Here we are engaged in ethical inquiry, and\nare not asking a purely instrumental question.) But if practical\nreasoning is correct only if it begins from a correct premise, what is\nit that insures the correctness of its starting point? \nAristotle replies: “Virtue makes the goal right, practical\nwisdom the things leading to it” (1144a7–8). By this he\ncannot mean that there is no room for reasoning about our ultimate\nend. For as we have seen, he gives a reasoned defense of his\nconception of happiness as virtuous activity. What he must have in\nmind, when he says that virtue makes the goal right, is that\ndeliberation typically proceeds from a goal that is far more specific\nthan the goal of attaining happiness by acting virtuously. To be sure,\nthere may be occasions when a good person approaches an ethical\nproblem by beginning with the premise that happiness consists in\nvirtuous activity. But more often what happens is that a concrete goal\npresents itself as his starting point—helping a friend in need,\nor supporting a worthwhile civic project. Which specific project we\nset for ourselves is determined by our character. A good person starts\nfrom worthwhile concrete ends because his habits and emotional\norientation have given him the ability to recognize that such goals\nare within reach, here and now. Those who are defective in character\nmay have the rational skill needed to achieve their ends—the\nskill Aristotle calls cleverness (1144a23–8)—but often the\nends they seek are worthless. The cause of this deficiency lies not in\nsome impairment in their capacity to reason—for we are assuming\nthat they are normal in this respect—but in the training of\ntheir passions. \nSince Aristotle often calls attention to the imprecision of ethical\ntheory (see e.g. 1104a1–7), it comes as a surprise to many\nreaders of the Ethics that he begins Book VI with the\nadmission that his earlier statements about the mean need\nsupplementation because they are not yet clear (saphes). In\nevery practical discipline, the expert aims at a mark and uses right\nreason to avoid the twin extremes of excess and deficiency. But what\nis this right reason, and by what standard (horos) is it to\nbe determined? Aristotle says that unless we answer that question, we\nwill be none the wiser—just as a student of medicine will have\nfailed to master his subject if he can only say that the right\nmedicines to administer are the ones that are prescribed by medical\nexpertise, but has no standard other than this (1138b18–34). \nIt is not easy to understand the point Aristotle is making here. Has\nhe not already told us that there can be no complete theoretical guide\nto ethics, that the best one can hope for is that in particular\nsituations one's ethical habits and practical wisdom will help one\ndetermine what to do? Furthermore, Aristotle nowhere announces, in the\nremainder of Book VI, that we have achieved the greater degree of\naccuracy that he seems to be looking for. The rest of this Book is a\ndiscussion of the various kinds of intellectual virtues: theoretical\nwisdom, science (epistêmê), intuitive understanding\n(nous), practical wisdom, and craft expertise. Aristotle\nexplains what each of these states of mind is, draws various contrasts\namong them, and takes up various questions that can be raised about\ntheir usefulness. At no point does he explicitly return to the\nquestion he raised at the beginning of Book VI; he never says,\n“and now we have the standard of right reason that we were\nlooking for”. Nor is it easy to see how his discussion of these\nfive intellectual virtues can bring greater precision to the doctrine\nof the mean. \nWe can make some progress towards solving this problem if we remind\nourselves that at the beginning of the Ethics, Aristotle\ndescribes his inquiry as an attempt to develop a better understanding\nof what our ultimate aim should be. The sketchy answer he gives in\nBook I is that happiness consists in virtuous activity. In Books II\nthrough V, he describes the virtues of the part of the soul that is\nrational in that it can be attentive to reason, even though it is not\ncapable of deliberating. But precisely because these virtues are\nrational only in this derivative way, they are a less important\ncomponent of our ultimate end than is the intellectual\nvirtue—practical wisdom—with which they are integrated. If\nwhat we know about virtue is only what is said in Books II through V,\nthen our grasp of our ultimate end is radically incomplete, because we\nstill have not studied the intellectual virtue that enables us to\nreason well in any given situation. One of the things, at least,\ntowards which Aristotle is gesturing, as he begins Book VI, is\npractical wisdom. This state of mind has not yet been analyzed, and\nthat is one reason why he complains that his account of our ultimate\nend is not yet clear enough. \nBut is practical wisdom the only ingredient of our ultimate end that\nhas not yet been sufficiently discussed? Book VI discusses five\nintellectual virtues, not just practical wisdom, but it is clear that\nat least one of these—craft knowledge—is considered only\nin order to provide a contrast with the others. Aristotle is not\nrecommending that his readers make this intellectual virtue part of\ntheir ultimate aim. But what of the remaining three: science,\nintuitive understanding, and the virtue that combines them,\ntheoretical wisdom? Are these present in Book VI only in order to\nprovide a contrast with practical wisdom, or is Aristotle saying that\nthese too must be components of our goal? He does not fully address\nthis issue, but it is evident from several of his remarks in Book VI\nthat he takes theoretical wisdom to be a more valuable state of mind\nthan practical wisdom.  \nIt is strange if someone thinks that politics or practical wisdom is\nthe most excellent kind of knowledge, unless man is the best thing in\nthe cosmos. (1141a20–22)  \nHe says that theoretical wisdom produces happiness by being a part of\nvirtue (1144a3–6), and that practical wisdom looks to the\ndevelopment of theoretical wisdom, and issues commands for its sake\n(1145a8–11). So it is clear that exercising theoretical wisdom\nis a more important component of our ultimate goal than practical\nwisdom. \nEven so, it may still seem perplexing that these two intellectual\nvirtues, either separately or collectively, should somehow fill a gap\nin the doctrine of the mean. Having read Book VI and completed our\nstudy of what these two forms of wisdom are, how are we better able to\nsucceed in finding the mean in particular situations? \nThe answer to this question may be that Aristotle does not intend Book\nVI to provide a full answer to that question, but rather to serve as a\nprolegomenon to an answer. For it is only near the end of Book X that\nhe presents a full discussion of the relative merits of these two\nkinds of intellectual virtue, and comments on the different degrees to\nwhich each needs to be provided with resources. In X.7–8, he\nargues that the happiest kind of life is that of a\nphilosopher—someone who exercises, over a long period of time,\nthe virtue of theoretical wisdom, and has sufficient resources for\ndoing so. (We will discuss these chapters more fully in section 10\nbelow.) One of his reasons for thinking that such a life is superior\nto the second-best kind of life—that of a political leader,\nsomeone who devotes himself to the exercise of practical rather than\ntheoretical wisdom—is that it requires less external equipment\n(1178a23–b7). Aristotle has already made it clear in his\ndiscussion of the ethical virtues that someone who is greatly honored\nby his community and commands large financial resources is in a\nposition to exercise a higher order of ethical virtue than is someone\nwho receives few honors and has little property. The virtue of\nmagnificence is superior to mere liberality, and similarly greatness\nof soul is a higher excellence than the ordinary virtue that has to do\nwith honor. (These qualities are discussed in IV.1–4.) The\ngrandest expression of ethical virtue requires great political power,\nbecause it is the political leader who is in a position to do the\ngreatest amount of good for the community. The person who chooses to\nlead a political life, and who aims at the fullest expression of\npractical wisdom, has a standard for deciding what level of resources\nhe needs: he should have friends, property, and honors in sufficient\nquantities to allow his practical wisdom to express itself without\nimpediment. But if one chooses instead the life of a philosopher, then\none will look to a different standard—the fullest expression of\ntheoretical wisdom—and one will need a smaller supply of these\nresources. \nThis enables us to see how Aristotle's treatment of the intellectual\nvirtues does give greater content and precision to the doctrine of the\nmean. The best standard is the one adopted by the philosopher; the\nsecond-best is the one adopted by the political leader. In either\ncase, it is the exercise of an intellectual virtue that provides a\nguideline for making important quantitative decisions. This supplement\nto the doctrine of the mean is fully compatible with Aristotle's\nthesis that no set of rules, no matter how long and detailed, obviates\nthe need for deliberative and ethical virtue. If one chooses the life\nof a philosopher, one should keep the level of one's resources high\nenough to secure the leisure necessary for such a life, but not so\nhigh that one's external equipment becomes a burden and a distraction\nrather than an aid to living well. That gives one a firmer idea of how\nto hit the mean, but it still leaves the details to be worked out. The\nphilosopher will need to determine, in particular situations, where\njustice lies, how to spend wisely, when to meet or avoid a danger, and\nso on. All of the normal difficulties of ethical life remain, and they\ncan be solved only by means of a detailed understanding of the\nparticulars of each situation. Having philosophy as one's ultimate aim\ndoes not put an end to the need for developing and exercising\npractical wisdom and the ethical virtues. \nIn VII.1–10 Aristotle investigates character\ntraits—continence and incontinence—that are not as\nblameworthy as the vices but not as praiseworthy as the virtues. (We\nbegan our discussion of these qualities in section 4.) The Greek terms\nare akrasia (“incontinence”; literally:\n“lack of mastery”) and enkrateia\n(“continence”; literally “mastery”). An\nakratic person goes against reason as a result of some pathos\n(“emotion”, “feeling”). Like the akratic, an\nenkratic person experiences a feeling that is contrary to reason; but\nunlike the akratic, he acts in accordance with reason. His defect\nconsists solely in the fact that, more than most people, he\nexperiences passions that conflict with his rational choice. The\nakratic person has not only this defect, but has the further flaw that\nhe gives in to feeling rather than reason more often than the average\nperson. \nAristotle distinguishes two kinds of akrasia: impetuosity\n(propeteia) and weakness (astheneia). The person who\nis weak goes through a process of deliberation and makes a choice; but\nrather than act in accordance with his reasoned choice, he acts under\nthe influence of a passion. By contrast, the impetuous person does not\ngo through a process of deliberation and does not make a reasoned\nchoice; he simply acts under the influence of a passion. At the time\nof action, the impetuous person experiences no internal conflict. But\nonce his act has been completed, he regrets what he has done. One\ncould say that he deliberates, if deliberation were something that\npost-dated rather than preceded action; but the thought process he\ngoes through after he acts comes too late to save him from error. \nIt is important to bear in mind that when Aristotle talks about\nimpetuosity and weakness, he is discussing chronic conditions. The\nimpetuous person is someone who acts emotionally and fails to\ndeliberate not just once or twice but with some frequency; he makes\nthis error more than most people do. Because of this pattern in his\nactions, we would be justified in saying of the impetuous person that\nhad his passions not prevented him from doing so, he would have\ndeliberated and chosen an action different from the one he did\nperform. \nThe two kinds of passions that Aristotle focuses on, in his treatment\nof akrasia, are the appetite for pleasure and anger. Either\ncan lead to impetuosity and weakness. But Aristotle gives pride of\nplace to the appetite for pleasure as the passion that undermines\nreason. He calls the kind of akrasia caused by an appetite\nfor pleasure “unqualified akrasia”—or, as\nwe might say, akrasia “full stop”;\nakrasia caused by anger he considers a qualified form of\nakrasia and calls it akrasia “with respect to\nanger”. We thus have these four forms of akrasia: (A)\nimpetuosity caused by pleasure, (B) impetuosity caused by anger, (C)\nweakness caused by pleasure (D) weakness caused by anger. It should be\nnoticed that Aristotle's treatment of akrasia is heavily\ninfluenced by Plato's tripartite division of the soul in the\nRepublic. Plato holds that either the spirited part (which\nhouses anger, as well as other emotions) or the appetitive part (which\nhouses the desire for physical pleasures) can disrupt the dictates of\nreason and result in action contrary to reason. The same threefold\ndivision of the soul can be seen in Aristotle's approach to this\ntopic. \nAlthough Aristotle characterizes akrasia and\nenkrateia in terms of a conflict between reason and feeling,\nhis detailed analysis of these states of mind shows that what takes\nplace is best described in a more complicated way. For the feeling\nthat undermines reason contains some thought, which may be implicitly\ngeneral. As Aristotle says, anger “reasoning as it were that one\nmust fight against such a thing, is immediately provoked”\n(1149a33–4). And although in the next sentence he denies that\nour appetite for pleasure works in this way, he earlier had said that\nthere can be a syllogism that favors pursuing enjoyment:\n“Everything sweet is pleasant, and this is sweet” leads to\nthe pursuit of a particular pleasure (1147a31–30). Perhaps what\nhe has in mind is that pleasure can operate in either way: it can\nprompt action unmediated by a general premise, or it can prompt us to\nact on such a syllogism. By contrast, anger always moves us by\npresenting itself as a bit of general, although hasty, reasoning. \nBut of course Aristotle does not mean that a conflicted person has\nmore than one faculty of reason. Rather his idea seems to be that in\naddition to our full-fledged reasoning capacity, we also have\npsychological mechanisms that are capable of a limited range of\nreasoning. When feeling conflicts with reason, what occurs is better\ndescribed as a fight between feeling-allied-with-limited-reasoning and\nfull-fledged reason. Part of us—reason—can remove itself\nfrom the distorting influence of feeling and consider all relevant\nfactors, positive and negative. But another part of us—feeling\nor emotion—has a more limited field of reasoning—and\nsometimes it does not even make use of it. \nAlthough “passion” is sometimes used as a translation of\nAristotle's word pathos (other alternatives are\n“emotion” and “feeling”), it is important to\nbear in mind that his term does not necessarily designate a strong\npsychological force. Anger is a pathos whether it is weak or\nstrong; so too is the appetite for bodily pleasures. And he clearly\nindicates that it is possible for an akratic person to be defeated by\na weak pathos—the kind that most people would easily be\nable to control (1150a9–b16). So the general explanation for the\noccurrence of akrasia cannot be that the strength of a\npassion overwhelms reason. Aristotle should therefore be acquitted of\nan accusation made against him by J.L. Austin in a well-known footnote\nto his paper, “A Plea For Excuses”. Plato and Aristotle,\nhe says, collapsed all succumbing to temptation into losing control of\nourselves—a mistake illustrated by this example:  \nI am very partial to ice cream, and a bombe is served divided into\nsegments corresponding one to one with the persons at High Table: I am\ntempted to help myself to two segments and do so, thus succumbing to\ntemptation and even conceivably (but why necessarily?) going against\nmy principles. But do I lose control of myself? Do I raven, do I\nsnatch the morsels from the dish and wolf them down, impervious to the\nconsternation of my colleagues? Not a bit of it. We often succumb to\ntemptation with calm and even with finesse. (1957: 24, fn 13 [1961:\n146])  \nWith this, Aristotle can agree: the pathos for the bombe can\nbe a weak one, and in some people that will be enough to get them to\nact in a way that is disapproved by their reason at the very time of\naction. \nWhat is most remarkable about Aristotle's discussion of\nakrasia is that he defends a position close to that of\nSocrates. When he first introduces the topic of akrasia, and\nsurveys some of the problems involved in understanding this\nphenomenon, he says (1145b25–8) that Socrates held that there is\nno akrasia, and he describes this as a thesis that clearly\nconflicts with the appearances (phainomena). Since he says\nthat his goal is to preserve as many of the appearances as possible\n(1145b2–7), it may come as a surprise that when he analyzes the\nconflict between reason and feeling, he arrives at the conclusion that\nin a way Socrates was right after all (1147b13–17). For, he\nsays, the person who acts against reason does not have what is thought\nto be unqualified knowledge; in a way he has knowledge, but in a way\ndoes not. \nAristotle explains what he has in mind by comparing akrasia\nto the condition of other people who might be described as knowing in\na way, but not in an unqualified way. His examples are people who are\nasleep, mad, or drunk; he also compares the akratic to a student who\nhas just begun to learn a subject, or an actor on the stage\n(1147a10–24). All of these people, he says, can utter the very\nwords used by those who have knowledge; but their talk does not prove\nthat they really have knowledge, strictly speaking. \nThese analogies can be taken to mean that the form of akrasia\nthat Aristotle calls weakness rather than impetuosity always results\nfrom some diminution of cognitive or intellectual acuity at the moment\nof action. The akratic says, at the time of action, that he ought not\nto indulge in this particular pleasure at this time. But does he know\nor even believe that he should refrain? Aristotle might be taken to\nreply: yes and no. He has some degree of recognition that he must not\ndo this now, but not full recognition. His feeling, even if it is\nweak, has to some degree prevented him from completely grasping or\naffirming the point that he should not do this. And so in a way\nSocrates was right. When reason remains unimpaired and unclouded, its\ndictates will carry us all the way to action, so long as we are able\nto act. \nBut Aristotle's agreement with Socrates is only partial, because he\ninsists on the power of the emotions to rival, weaken or bypass\nreason. Emotion challenges reason in all three of these ways. In both\nthe akratic and the enkratic, it competes with reason for control over\naction; even when reason wins, it faces the difficult task of having\nto struggle with an internal rival. Second, in the akratic, it\ntemporarily robs reason of its full acuity, thus handicapping it as a\ncompetitor. It is not merely a rival force, in these cases; it is a\nforce that keeps reason from fully exercising its power. And third,\npassion can make someone impetuous; here its victory over reason is so\npowerful that the latter does not even enter into the arena of\nconscious reflection until it is too late to influence action. \nAristotle frequently emphasizes the importance of pleasure to human\nlife and therefore to his study of how we should live (see for example\n1099a7–20 and 1104b3–1105a16), but his full-scale\nexamination of the nature and value of pleasure is found in two\nplaces: VII.11–14 and X.1–5. It is odd that pleasure\nreceives two lengthy treatments; no other topic in the Ethics\nis revisited in this way. Book VII of the Nicomachean Ethics\nis identical to Book VI of the Eudemian Ethics; for unknown\nreasons, the editor of the former decided to include within it both\nthe treatment of pleasure that is unique to that work (X.1–5)\nand the study that is common to both treatises (VII.11–14). The\ntwo accounts are broadly similar. They agree about the value of\npleasure, defend a theory about its nature, and oppose competing\ntheories. Aristotle holds that a happy life must include pleasure, and\nhe therefore opposes those who argue that pleasure is by its nature\nbad. He insists that there are other pleasures besides those of the\nsenses, and that the best pleasures are the ones experienced by\nvirtuous people who have sufficient resources for excellent\nactivity. \nBook VII offers a brief account of what pleasure is and is not. It is\nnot a process but an unimpeded activity of a natural state\n(1153a7–17). Aristotle does not elaborate on what a natural\nstate is, but he obviously has in mind the healthy condition of the\nbody, especially its sense faculties, and the virtuous condition of\nthe soul. Little is said about what it is for an activity to be\nunimpeded, but Aristotle does remind us that virtuous activity is\nimpeded by the absence of a sufficient supply of external goods\n(1153b17–19). One might object that people who are sick or who\nhave moral deficiencies can experience pleasure, even though Aristotle\ndoes not take them to be in a natural state. He has two strategies for\nresponding. First, when a sick person experiences some degree of\npleasure as he is being restored to health, the pleasure he is feeling\nis caused by the fact that he is no longer completely ill. Some small\npart of him is in a natural state and is acting without impediment\n(1152b35–6). Second, Aristotle is willing to say that what seems\npleasant to some people may in fact not be pleasant (1152b31–2),\njust as what tastes bitter to an unhealthy palate may not be bitter.\nTo call something a pleasure is not only to report a state of mind but\nalso to endorse it to others. Aristotle's analysis of the nature of\npleasure is not meant to apply to every case in which something seems\npleasant to someone, but only to activities that really are pleasures.\nAll of these are unimpeded activities of a natural state. \nIt follows from this conception of pleasure that every instance of\npleasure must be good to some extent. For how could an unimpeded\nactivity of a natural state be bad or a matter of indifference? On the\nother hand, Aristotle does not mean to imply that every pleasure\nshould be chosen. He briefly mentions the point that pleasures compete\nwith each other, so that the enjoyment of one kind of activity impedes\nother activities that cannot be carried out at the same time\n(1153a20–22). His point is simply that although some pleasures\nmay be good, they are not worth choosing when they interfere with\nother activities that are far better. This point is developed more\nfully in Ethics X.5. \nFurthermore, Aristotle's analysis allows him to speak of certain\npleasures as “bad without qualification”\n(1152b26–33), even though pleasure is the unimpeded activity of\na natural state. To call a pleasure “bad without\nqualification” is to insist that it should be avoided, but allow\nthat nonetheless it should be chosen in constraining circumstances.\nThe pleasure of recovering from an illness, for example, is bad\nwithout qualification—meaning that it is not one of the\npleasures one would ideally choose, if one could completely control\none's circumstances. Although it really is a pleasure and so something\ncan be said in its favor, it is so inferior to other goods that\nideally one ought to forego it. Nonetheless, it is a pleasure worth\nhaving—if one adds the qualification that it is only worth\nhaving in undesirable circumstances. The pleasure of recovering from\nan illness is good, because some small part of oneself is in a natural\nstate and is acting without impediment; but it can also be called bad,\nif what one means by this is that one should avoid getting into a\nsituation in which one experiences that pleasure. \nAristotle indicates several times in VII.11–14 that merely to\nsay that pleasure is a good does not do it enough justice; he\nalso wants to say that the highest good is a pleasure. Here he is\ninfluenced by an idea expressed in the opening line of the\nEthics: the good is that at which all things aim. In VII.13,\nhe hints at the idea that all living things imitate the contemplative\nactivity of god (1153b31–2). Plants and non-human animals seek\nto reproduce themselves because that is their way of participating in\nan unending series, and this is the closest they can come to the\nceaseless thinking of the unmoved mover. Aristotle makes this point in\nseveral of his works (see for example De Anima\n415a23–b7), and in Ethics X.7–8 he gives a full\ndefense of the idea that the happiest human life resembles the life of\na divine being. He conceives of god as a being who continually enjoys\na “single and simple pleasure” (1154b26)—the\npleasure of pure thought—whereas human beings, because of their\ncomplexity, grow weary of whatever they do. He will elaborate on these\npoints in X.8; in VII.11–14, he appeals to his conception of\ndivine activity only in order to defend the thesis that our highest\ngood consists in a certain kind of pleasure. Human happiness does not\nconsist in every kind of pleasure, but it does consist in one kind of\npleasure—the pleasure felt by a human being who engages in\ntheoretical activity and thereby imitates the pleasurable thinking of\ngod. \nBook X offers a much more elaborate account of what pleasure is and\nwhat it is not. It is not a process, because processes go through\ndevelopmental stages: building a temple is a process because the\ntemple is not present all at once, but only comes into being through\nstages that unfold over time. By contrast, pleasure, like seeing and\nmany other activities, is not something that comes into existence\nthrough a developmental process. If I am enjoying a conversation, for\nexample, I do not need to wait until it is finished in order to feel\npleased; I take pleasure in the activity all along the way. The\ndefining nature of pleasure is that it is an activity that accompanies\nother activities, and in some sense brings them to completion.\nPleasure occurs when something within us, having been brought into\ngood condition, is activated in relation to an external object that is\nalso in good condition. The pleasure of drawing, for example, requires\nboth the development of drawing ability and an object of attention\nthat is worth drawing. \nThe conception of pleasure that Aristotle develops in Book X is\nobviously closely related to the analysis he gives in Book VII. But\nthe theory proposed in the later Book brings out a point that had\nreceived too little attention earlier: pleasure is by its nature\nsomething that accompanies something else. It is not enough to say\nthat it is what happens when we are in good condition and are active\nin unimpeded circumstances; one must add to that point the further\nidea that pleasure plays a certain role in complementing something\nother than itself. Drawing well and the pleasure of drawing well\nalways occur together, and so they are easy to confuse, but\nAristotle's analysis in Book X emphasizes the importance of making\nthis distinction. \nHe says that pleasure completes the activity that it accompanies, but\nthen adds, mysteriously, that it completes the activity in the manner\nof an end that is added on. In the translation of W.D. Ross, it\n“supervenes as the bloom of youth does on those in the flower of\ntheir age” (1174b33). It is unclear what thought is being\nexpressed here, but perhaps Aristotle is merely trying to avoid a\npossible misunderstanding: when he says that pleasure completes an\nactivity, he does not mean that the activity it accompanies is in some\nway defective, and that the pleasure improves the activity by removing\nthis defect. Aristotle's language is open to that misinterpretation\nbecause the verb that is translated “complete”\n(teleein) can also mean “perfect”. The latter\nmight be taken to mean that the activity accompanied by pleasure has\nnot yet reached a sufficiently high level of excellence, and that the\nrole of pleasure is to bring it to the point of perfection. Aristotle\ndoes not deny that when we take pleasure in an activity we get better\nat it, but when he says that pleasure completes an activity by\nsupervening on it, like the bloom that accompanies those who have\nachieved the highest point of physical beauty, his point is that the\nactivity complemented by pleasure is already perfect, and the pleasure\nthat accompanies it is a bonus that serves no further purpose. Taking\npleasure in an activity does help us improve at it, but enjoyment does\nnot cease when perfection is achieved—on the contrary, that is\nwhen pleasure is at its peak. That is when it reveals most fully what\nit is: an added bonus that crowns our achievement. \nIt is clear, at any rate, that in Book X Aristotle gives a fuller\naccount of what pleasure is than he had in Book VII. We should take\nnote of a further difference between these two discussions: In Book X,\nhe makes the point that pleasure is a good but not the\ngood. He cites and endorses an argument given by Plato in the\nPhilebus: If we imagine a life filled with pleasure and then\nmentally add wisdom to it, the result is made more desirable. But the\ngood is something that cannot be improved upon in this way. Therefore\npleasure is not the good (1172b23–35). By contrast, in Book VII\nAristotle strongly implies that the pleasure of contemplation\nis the good, because in one way or another all living beings\naim at this sort of pleasure. Aristotle observes in Book X that what\nall things aim at is good (1172b35–1173a1); significantly, he\nfalls short of endorsing the argument that since all aim at pleasure,\nit must be the good. \nBook VII makes the point that pleasures interfere with each other, and\nso even if all kinds of pleasures are good, it does not follow that\nall of them are worth choosing. One must make a selection among\npleasures by determining which are better. But how is one to make this\nchoice? Book VII does not say, but in Book X, Aristotle holds that the\nselection of pleasures is not to be made with reference to pleasure\nitself, but with reference to the activities they accompany.  \nSince activities differ with respect to goodness and badness, some\nbeing worth choosing, others worth avoiding, and others neither, the\nsame is true of pleasures as well. (1175b24–6)  \nAristotle's statement implies that in order to determine whether (for\nexample) the pleasure of virtuous activity is more desirable than that\nof eating, we are not to attend to the pleasures themselves but to the\nactivities with which we are pleased. A pleasure's goodness derives\nfrom the goodness of its associated activity. And surely the reason\nwhy pleasure is not the criterion to which we should look in making\nthese decisions is that it is not the good. The standard we should use\nin making comparisons between rival options is virtuous activity,\nbecause that has been shown to be identical to happiness. \nThat is why Aristotle says that what is judged pleasant by a good man\nreally is pleasant, because the good man is the measure of things\n(1176a15–19). He does not mean that the way to lead our lives is\nto search for a good man and continually rely on him to tell us what\nis pleasurable. Rather, his point is that there is no way of telling\nwhat is genuinely pleasurable (and therefore what is most pleasurable)\nunless we already have some other standard of value. Aristotle's\ndiscussion of pleasure thus helps confirm his initial hypothesis that\nto live our lives well we must focus on one sort of good above all\nothers: virtuous activity. It is the good in terms of which all other\ngoods must be understood. Aristotle's analysis of friendship supports\nthe same conclusion. \nThe topic of Books VIII and IX of the Ethics is friendship.\nAlthough it is difficult to avoid the term “friendship” as\na translation of “philia”, and this is an\naccurate term for the kind of relationship he is most interested in,\nwe should bear in mind that he is discussing a wider range of\nphenomena than this translation might lead us to expect, for the\nGreeks use the term, “philia”, to name the\nrelationship that holds among family members, and do not reserve it\nfor voluntary relationships. Although Aristotle is interested in\nclassifying the different forms that friendship takes, his main theme\nin Books VIII and IX is to show the close relationship between\nvirtuous activity and friendship. He is vindicating his conception of\nhappiness as virtuous activity by showing how satisfying are the\nrelationships that a virtuous person can normally expect to have. \nHis taxonomy begins with the premise that there are three main reasons\nwhy one person might like someone else. (The verb,\n“philein”, which is cognate to the noun\n“philia”, can sometimes be translated\n“like” or even “love”—though in other\ncases philia involves very little in the way of feeling.) One\nmight like someone because he is good, or because he is useful, or\nbecause he is pleasant. And so there are three bases for friendships,\ndepending on which of these qualities binds friends together. When two\nindividuals recognize that the other person is someone of good\ncharacter, and they spend time with each other, engaged in activities\nthat exercise their virtues, then they form one kind of friendship. If\nthey are equally virtuous, their friendship is perfect. If, however,\nthere is a large gap in their moral development (as between a parent\nand a small child, or between a husband and a wife), then although\ntheir relationship may be based on the other person's good character,\nit will be imperfect precisely because of their inequality. \nThe imperfect friendships that Aristotle focuses on, however, are not\nunequal relationships based on good character. Rather, they are\nrelationships held together because each individual regards the other\nas the source of some advantage to himself or some pleasure he\nreceives. When Aristotle calls these relationships\n“imperfect”, he is tacitly relying on widely accepted\nassumptions about what makes a relationship satisfying. These\nfriendships are defective, and have a smaller claim to be called\n“friendships”, because the individuals involved have\nlittle trust in each other, quarrel frequently, and are ready to break\noff their association abruptly. Aristotle does not mean to suggest\nthat unequal relations based on the mutual recognition of good\ncharacter are defective in these same ways. Rather, when he says that\nunequal relationships based on character are imperfect, his point is\nthat people are friends in the fullest sense when they gladly spend\ntheir days together in shared activities, and this close and constant\ninteraction is less available to those who are not equal in their\nmoral development. \nWhen Aristotle begins his discussion of friendship, he introduces a\nnotion that is central to his understanding of this phenomenon: a\ngenuine friend is someone who loves or likes another person for the\nsake of that other person. Wanting what is good for the sake of\nanother he calls “good will” (eunoia), and\nfriendship is reciprocal good will, provided that each recognizes the\npresence of this attitude in the other. Does such good will exist in\nall three kinds of friendship, or is it confined to relationships\nbased on virtue? At first, Aristotle leaves open the first of these\ntwo possibilities. He says:  \nit is necessary that friends bear good will to each other and wish\ngood things for each other, without this escaping their notice,\nbecause of one of the reasons mentioned. (1156a4–5)  \nThe reasons mentioned are goodness, pleasure, and advantage; and so it\nseems that Aristotle is leaving room for the idea that in all three\nkinds of friendships, even those based on advantage and pleasure\nalone, the individuals wish each other well for the sake of the\nother. \nBut in fact, as Aristotle continues to develop his taxonomy, he does\nnot choose to exploit this possibility. He speaks as though it is only\nin friendships based on character that one finds a desire to benefit\nthe other person for the sake of the other person.  \nThose who wish good things to their friends for the sake of the latter\nare friends most of all, because they do so because of their friends\nthemselves, and not coincidentally. (1156b9–11)  \nWhen one benefits someone not because of the kind of person he is, but\nonly because of the advantages to oneself, then, Aristotle says, one\nis not a friend towards the other person, but only towards the profit\nthat comes one's way (1157a15–16). \nIn such statements as these, Aristotle comes rather close to saying\nthat relationships based on profit or pleasure should not be called\nfriendships at all. But he decides to stay close to common parlance\nand to use the term “friend” loosely. Friendships based on\ncharacter are the ones in which each person benefits the other for the\nsake of other; and these are friendships most of all. Because each\nparty benefits the other, it is advantageous to form such friendships.\nAnd since each enjoys the trust and companionship of the other, there\nis considerable pleasure in these relationships as well. Because these\nperfect friendships produce advantages and pleasures for each of the\nparties, there is some basis for going along with common usage and\ncalling any relationship entered into for the sake of just one of\nthese goods a friendship. Friendships based on advantage alone or\npleasure alone deserve to be called friendships because in\nfull-fledged friendships these two properties, advantage and pleasure,\nare present. It is striking that in the Ethics Aristotle\nnever thinks of saying that the uniting factor in all friendships is\nthe desire each friend has for the good of the other. \nAristotle does not raise questions about what it is to desire good for\nthe sake of another person. He treats this as an easily understood\nphenomenon, and has no doubts about its existence. But it is also\nclear that he takes this motive to be compatible with a love of one's\nown good and a desire for one's own happiness. Someone who has\npractical wisdom will recognize that he needs friends and other\nresources in order to exercise his virtues over a long period of time.\nWhen he makes friends, and benefits friends he has made, he will be\naware of the fact that such a relationship is good for him. And yet to\nhave a friend is to want to benefit someone for that other person's\nsake; it is not a merely self-interested strategy. Aristotle sees no\ndifficulty here, and rightly so. For there is no reason why acts of\nfriendship should not be undertaken partly for the good of one's\nfriend and partly for one's own good. Acting for the sake of another\ndoes not in itself demand self-sacrifice. It requires caring about\nsomeone other than oneself, but does not demand some loss of care for\noneself. For when we know how to benefit a friend for his sake, we\nexercise the ethical virtues, and this is precisely what our happiness\nconsists in. \nAristotle makes it clear that the number of people with whom one can\nsustain the kind of relationship he calls a perfect friendship is\nquite small (IX.10). Even if one lived in a city populated entirely by\nperfectly virtuous citizens, the number with whom one could carry on a\nfriendship of the perfect type would be at most a handful. For he\nthinks that this kind of friendship can exist only when one spends a\ngreat deal of time with the other person, participating in joint\nactivities and engaging in mutually beneficial behavior; and one\ncannot cooperate on these close terms with every member of the\npolitical community. One may well ask why this kind of close\nfriendship is necessary for happiness. If one lived in a community\nfilled with good people, and cooperated on an occasional basis with\neach of them, in a spirit of good will and admiration, would that not\nprovide sufficient scope for virtuous activity and a well-lived life?\nAdmittedly, close friends are often in a better position to benefit\neach other than are fellow citizens, who generally have little\nknowledge of one's individual circumstances. But this only shows that\nit is advantageous to be on the receiving end of a friend's help. The\nmore important question for Aristotle is why one needs to be on the\ngiving end of this relationship. And obviously the answer cannot be\nthat one needs to give in order to receive; that would turn active\nlove for one's friend into a mere means to the benefits received. \nAristotle attempts to answer this question in IX.11, but his treatment\nis disappointing. His fullest argument depends crucially on the notion\nthat a friend is “another self”, someone, in other words,\nwith whom one has a relationship very similar to the relationship one\nhas with oneself. A virtuous person loves the recognition of himself\nas virtuous; to have a close friend is to possess yet another person,\nbesides oneself, whose virtue one can recognize at extremely close\nquarters; and so, it must be desirable to have someone very much like\noneself whose virtuous activity one can perceive. The argument is\nunconvincing because it does not explain why the perception of\nvirtuous activity in fellow citizens would not be an adequate\nsubstitute for the perception of virtue in one's friends. \nAristotle would be on stronger grounds if he could show that in the\nabsence of close friends one would be severely restricted in the kinds\nof virtuous activities one could undertake. But he cannot present such\nan argument, because he does not believe it. He says that it is\n“finer and more godlike” to bring about the well being of\na whole city than to sustain the happiness of just one person\n(1094b7–10). He refuses to regard private life—the realm\nof the household and the small circle of one's friends—as the\nbest or most favorable location for the exercise of virtue. He is\nconvinced that the loss of this private sphere would greatly detract\nfrom a well-lived life, but he is hard put to explain why. He might\nhave done better to focus on the benefits of being the object of a\nclose friend's solicitude. Just as property is ill cared for when it\nis owned by all, and just as a child would be poorly nurtured were he\nto receive no special parental care—points Aristotle makes in\nPolitics II.2–5—so in the absence of friendship\nwe would lose a benefit that could not be replaced by the care of the\nlarger community. But Aristotle is not looking for a defense of this\nsort, because he conceives of friendship as lying primarily in\nactivity rather than receptivity. It is difficult, within his\nframework, to show that virtuous activity towards a friend is a\nuniquely important good. \nSince Aristotle thinks that the pursuit of one's own happiness,\nproperly understood, requires ethically virtuous activity and will\ntherefore be of great value not only to one's friends but to the\nlarger political community as well, he argues that self-love is an\nentirely proper emotion—provided it is expressed in the love of\nvirtue (IX.8). Self-love is rightly condemned when it consists in the\npursuit of as large a share of external goods—particularly\nwealth and power—as one can acquire, because such self-love\ninevitably brings one into conflict with others and undermines the\nstability of the political community. It may be tempting to cast\nAristotle's defense of self-love into modern terms by calling him an\negoist, and “egoism” is a broad enough term so that,\nproperly defined, it can be made to fit Aristotle's ethical outlook.\nIf egoism is the thesis that one will always act rightly if one\nconsults one's self-interest, properly understood, then nothing would\nbe amiss in identifying him as an egoist. \nBut egoism is sometimes understood in a stronger sense. Just as\nconsequentialism is the thesis that one should maximize the general\ngood, whatever the good turns out to be, so egoism can be defined as\nthe parallel thesis that one should maximize one's own good, whatever\nthe good turns out to be. Egoism, in other words, can be treated as a\npurely formal thesis: it holds that whether the good is pleasure, or\nvirtue, or the satisfaction of desires, one should not attempt to\nmaximize the total amount of good in the world, but only one's own.\nWhen egoism takes this abstract form, it is an expression of the idea\nthat the claims of others are never worth attending to, unless in some\nway or other their good can be shown to serve one's own. The only\nunderived reason for action is self-interest; that an act helps\nanother does not by itself provide a reason for performing it, unless\nsome connection can be made between the good of that other and one's\nown. \nThere is no reason to attribute this extreme form of egoism to\nAristotle. On the contrary, his defense of self-love makes it clear\nthat he is not willing to defend the bare idea that one ought to love\noneself alone or above others; he defends self-love only when this\nemotion is tied to the correct theory of where one's good lies, for it\nis only in this way that he can show that self-love need not be a\ndestructive passion. He takes it for granted that self-love is\nproperly condemned whenever it can be shown to be harmful to the\ncommunity. It is praiseworthy only if it can be shown that a\nself-lover will be an admirable citizen. In making this assumption,\nAristotle reveals that he thinks that the claims of other members of\nthe community to proper treatment are intrinsically valid. This is\nprecisely what a strong form of egoism cannot accept. \nWe should also keep in mind Aristotle's statement in the\nPolitics that the political community is prior to the\nindividual citizen—just as the whole body is prior to any of its\nparts (1253a18–29). Aristotle makes use of this claim when he\nproposes that in the ideal community each child should receive the\nsame education, and that the responsibility for providing such an\neducation should be taken out of the hands of private individuals and\nmade a matter of common concern (1337a21–7). No citizen, he\nsays, belongs to himself; all belong to the city (1337a28–9).\nWhat he means is that when it comes to such matters as education,\nwhich affect the good of all, each individual should be guided by the\ncollective decisions of the whole community. An individual citizen\ndoes not belong to himself, in the sense that it is not up to him\nalone to determine how he should act; he should subordinate his\nindividual decision-making powers to those of the whole. The strong\nform of egoism we have been discussing cannot accept Aristotle's\ndoctrine of the priority of the city to the individual. It tells the\nindividual that the good of others has, in itself, no valid claim on\nhim, but that he should serve other members of the community only to\nthe extent that he can connect their interests to his own. Such a\ndoctrine leaves no room for the thought that the individual citizen\ndoes not belong to himself but to the whole. \nIn Book I Aristotle says that three kinds of lives are thought to be\nespecially attractive: one is devoted to pleasure, a second to\npolitics, and a third to knowledge and understanding\n(1095b17–19). In X.6–9 he returns to these three\nalternatives, and explores them more fully than he had in Book I. The\nlife of pleasure is construed in Book I as a life devoted to physical\npleasure, and is quickly dismissed because of its vulgarity. In X.6,\nAristotle concedes that physical pleasures, and more generally,\namusements of all sorts, are desirable in themselves, and therefore\nhave some claim to be our ultimate end. But his discussion of\nhappiness in Book X does not start from scratch; he builds on his\nthesis that pleasure cannot be our ultimate target, because what\ncounts as pleasant must be judged by some standard other than pleasure\nitself, namely the judgment of the virtuous person. Amusements will\nnot be absent from a happy life, since everyone needs relaxation, and\namusements fill this need. But they play a subordinate role, because\nwe seek relaxation in order to return to more important\nactivities. \nAristotle turns therefore, in X.7–8, to the two remaining\nalternatives—politics and philosophy—and presents a series\nof arguments to show that the philosophical life, a life devoted to\ntheoria (contemplation, study), is best. Theoria is\nnot the process of learning that leads to understanding; that process\nis not a candidate for our ultimate end, because it is undertaken for\nthe sake of a further goal. What Aristotle has in mind when he talks\nabout theoria is the activity of someone who has already\nachieved theoretical wisdom. The happiest life is lived by someone who\nhas a full understanding of the basic causal principles that govern\nthe operation of the universe, and who has the resources needed for\nliving a life devoted to the exercise of that understanding. Evidently\nAristotle believes that his own life and that of his philosophical\nfriends was the best available to a human being. He compares it to the\nlife of a god: god thinks without interruption and endlessly, and a\nphilosopher enjoys something similar for a limited period of time. \nIt may seem odd that after devoting so much attention to the practical\nvirtues, Aristotle should conclude his treatise with the thesis that\nthe best activity of the best life is not ethical. In fact, some\nscholars have held that X.7–8 are deeply at odds with the rest\nof the Ethics; they take Aristotle to be saying that we\nshould be prepared to act unethically, if need be, in order to devote\nourselves as much as possible to contemplation. But it is difficult to\nbelieve that he intends to reverse himself so abruptly, and there are\nmany indications that he intends the arguments of X.7–8 to be\ncontinuous with the themes he emphasizes throughout the rest of the\nEthics. The best way to understand him is to take him to be\nassuming that one will need the ethical virtues in order to live the\nlife of a philosopher, even though exercising those virtues is not the\nphilosopher's ultimate end. To be adequately equipped to live a life\nof thought and discussion, one will need practical wisdom, temperance,\njustice, and the other ethical virtues. To say that there is something\nbetter even than ethical activity, and that ethical activity promotes\nthis higher goal, is entirely compatible with everything else that we\nfind in the Ethics. \nAlthough Aristotle's principal goal in X.7–8 is to show the\nsuperiority of philosophy to politics, he does not deny that a\npolitical life is happy. Perfect happiness, he says, consists in\ncontemplation; but he indicates that the life devoted to practical\nthought and ethical virtue is happy in a secondary way. He thinks of\nthis second-best life as that of a political leader, because he\nassumes that the person who most fully exercises such qualities as\njustice and greatness of soul is the man who has the large resources\nneeded to promote the common good of the city. The political life has\na major defect, despite the fact that it consists in fully exercising\nthe ethical virtues, because it is a life devoid of philosophical\nunderstanding and activity. Were someone to combine both careers,\npracticing politics at certain times and engaged in philosophical\ndiscussion at other times (as Plato's philosopher-kings do), he would\nlead a life better than that of Aristotle's politician, but worse than\nthat of Aristotle's philosopher. \nBut his complaint about the political life is not simply that it is\ndevoid of philosophical activity. The points he makes against it\nreveal drawbacks inherent in ethical and political activity. Perhaps\nthe most telling of these defects is that the life of the political\nleader is in a certain sense unleisurely (1177b4–15). What\nAristotle has in mind when he makes this complaint is that ethical\nactivities are remedial: they are needed when something has gone\nwrong, or threatens to do so. Courage, for example, is exercised in\nwar, and war remedies an evil; it is not something we should wish for.\nAristotle implies that all other political activities have the same\nfeature, although perhaps to a smaller degree. Corrective justice\nwould provide him with further evidence for his thesis—but what\nof justice in the distribution of goods? Perhaps Aristotle would reply\nthat in existing political communities a virtuous person must\naccommodate himself to the least bad method of distribution, because,\nhuman nature being what it is, a certain amount of injustice must be\ntolerated. As the courageous person cannot be completely satisfied\nwith his courageous action, no matter how much self-mastery it shows,\nbecause he is a peace-lover and not a killer, so the just person\nliving in the real world must experience some degree of\ndissatisfaction with his attempts to give each person his due. The\npleasures of exercising the ethical virtues are, in normal\ncircumstances, mixed with pain. Unalloyed pleasure is available to us\nonly when we remove ourselves from the all-too-human world and\ncontemplate the rational order of the cosmos. No human life can\nconsist solely in these pure pleasures; and in certain circumstances\none may owe it to one's community to forego a philosophical life and\ndevote oneself to the good of the city. But the paradigms of human\nhappiness are those people who are lucky enough to devote much of\ntheir time to the study of a world more orderly than the human world\nwe inhabit. \nAlthough Aristotle argues for the superiority of the philosophical\nlife in X.7–8, he says in X.9, the final chapter of the\nEthics, that his project is not yet complete, because we can\nmake human beings virtuous, or good even to some small degree, only if\nwe undertake a study of the art of legislation. The final section of\nthe Ethics is therefore intended as a prolegomenon to\nAristotle's political writings. We must investigate the kinds of\npolitical systems exhibited by existing Greek cities, the forces that\ndestroy or preserve cities, and the best sort of political order.\nAlthough the study of virtue Aristotle has just completed is meant to\nbe helpful to all human beings who have been brought up\nwell—even those who have no intention of pursuing a political\ncareer—it is also designed to serve a larger purpose. Human\nbeings cannot achieve happiness, or even something that approximates\nhappiness, unless they live in communities that foster good habits and\nprovide the basic equipment of a well-lived life. \nThe study of the human good has therefore led to two conclusions: The\nbest life is not to be found in the practice of politics. But the well\nbeing of whole communities depends on the willingness of some to lead\na second-best life—a life devoted to the study and practice of\nthe art of politics, and to the expression of those qualities of\nthought and passion that exhibit our rational self-mastery.","contact.mail":"rkraut1@northwestern.edu","contact.domain":"northwestern.edu"}]
