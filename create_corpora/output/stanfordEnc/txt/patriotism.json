How is it\nrelated to similar attitudes, such as nationalism? What is its moral\nstanding: is it morally valuable or perhaps even mandatory, or is it\nrather a stance we should avoid? Yet until a few decades ago,\nphilosophers used to show next to no interest in the subject. The\narticle on patriotism in the Historical Dictionary of\nPhilosophy, reviewing the use of the term from the\n16th century to our own times, gives numerous references,\nbut they are mostly to authors who were not philosophers. Moreover, of\nthe few well known philosophers cited, only one, J. G. Fichte, gave\nthe subject more than a passing reference – and most of what\nFichte had to say actually pertains to nationalism, rather than\npatriotism (see Busch and Dierse 1989).\n\n\nThis changed in the 1980s. The change was due, in part, to the revival\nof communitarianism, which came in response to the individualistic,\nliberal political and moral philosophy epitomized by John Rawls’\nTheory of Justice (1971); but it was also due to the\nresurgence of nationalism in several parts of the world. The beginning\nof this change was marked by Andrew Oldenquist’s account of\nmorality as a matter of various loyalties, rather than abstract\nprinciples and ideals (Oldenquist 1982), and Alasdair\nMacIntyre’s argument that patriotism is a central moral virtue\n(MacIntyre 1984). Largely in response to MacIntyre, some philosophers\nhave defended constrained or deflated versions of patriotism (Baron\n1989, Nathanson 1989, Primoratz 2002). Others have argued against\npatriotism of any sort (Gomberg 1990, McCabe 1997, Keller 2005). There\nis now a lively philosophical debate about the moral credentials of\npatriotism that shows no signs of abating. A parallel discussion in\npolitical philosophy concerns the kind of patriotism that might\nprovide an alternative to nationalism as the ethos of a stable,\nwell-functioning polity.\n\nThe standard dictionary definition reads “love of one’s\ncountry.” This captures the core meaning of the term in ordinary\nuse; but it might well be thought too thin and in need of fleshing\nout. In the first philosophical book-length study of the subject,\nStephen Nathanson (1993, 34–35) defines patriotism as\ninvolving: \nThere is little to cavil about here. There is no great difference\nbetween special affection and love, and Nathanson himself uses the\nterms interchangeably. Although love (or special affection) is usually\ngiven expression in special concern for its object, that is not\nnecessary. But a person whose love for her country was not expressed\nin any special concern for it would scarcely be considered a patriot.\nTherefore the definition needs to include such concern. Once that is\nincluded, however, a willingness to make sacrifices for one’s\ncountry is implied, and need not be added as a separate component.\nIdentification with the country, too, might be thought implied in the\nphrase “one’s country.” But the phrase is extremely\nvague, and allows for a country to be called “one’s\nown” in an extremely thin, formal sense too. It seems that if\none is to be a patriot of a country, the country must be his in some\nsignificant sense; and that may be best captured by speaking\nof one’s identification with it. Such identification is\nexpressed in vicarious feelings: in pride of one’s\ncountry’s merits and achievements, and in shame for its lapses\nor crimes (when these are acknowledged, rather than denied). \nAccordingly, patriotism can be defined as love of one’s country,\nidentification with it, and special concern for its well-being and\nthat of compatriots. \nThis is only a definition. A fuller account of patriotism is beyond\nthe scope of this article. Such an account would say something about\nthe patriot’s beliefs about the merits of his country, his need\nto belong to a group and be a part of a more encompassing narrative,\nto be related to a past and a future that transcend the narrow\nconfines of an individual’s life and its mundane concerns, as\nwell as social and political conditions that affect the ebb and flow\nof patriotism, its political and cultural influence, and more. \nDiscussions of both patriotism and\n nationalism\n are often marred by lack of clarity due to the failure to distinguish\nthe two. Many authors use the two terms interchangeably. Among those\nwho do not, quite a few have made the distinction in ways that are not\nvery helpful. In the 19th century, Lord Acton contrasted\n“nationality” and patriotism as affection and instinct vs.\na moral relation. Nationality is “our connection with the\nrace” that is “merely natural or physical,” while\npatriotism is the awareness of our moral duties to the political\ncommunity (Acton 1972, 163). In the 20th century, Elie\nKedourie did the opposite, presenting nationalism as a full-fledged\nphilosophical and political doctrine about nations as basic units of\nhumanity within which the individual can find freedom and fulfilment,\nand patriotism as mere sentiment of affection for one’s country\n(Kedourie 1985, 73–74). \nGeorge Orwell contrasted the two in terms of aggressive vs. defensive\nattitudes. Nationalism is about power: its adherent wants to acquire\nas much power and prestige as possible for his nation, in which he\nsubmerges his individuality. While nationalism is accordingly\naggressive, patriotism is defensive: it is a devotion to a particular\nplace and a way of life one thinks best, but has no wish to impose on\nothers (Orwell 1968, 362). This way of distinguishing the two\nattitudes comes close to an approach popular among politicians and\nwidespread in everyday discourse that indicates a double standard of\nthe form “us vs. them.” Country and nation are first run\ntogether, and then patriotism and nationalism are distinguished in\nterms of the strength of the love and special concern one feels for\nit, the degree of one’s identification with it. When these are\nexhibited in a reasonable degree and without ill thoughts about others\nand hostile actions towards them, that is patriotism; when they become\nunbridled and cause one to think ill of others and act badly towards\nthem, that is nationalism. Conveniently enough, it usually turns out\nthat we are patriots, while they are nationalists\n(see Billig 1995, 55–59). \nThere is yet another way of distinguishing patriotism and nationalism\n– one that is quite simple and begs no moral questions. We can\nput aside the political sense of “nation” that makes it\nidentical with “country,” “state,” or\n“polity,” and the political or civic type of nationalism\nrelated to it. We need concern ourselves only with the other, ethnic\nor cultural sense of “nation,” and focus on ethnic or\ncultural nationalism. In order to do so, we do not have to spell out\nthe relevant understanding of “nation”; it is enough to\ncharacterize it in terms of common ancestry, history, and a set of\ncultural traits. Both patriotism and nationalism involve love of,\nidentification with, and special concern for a certain entity. In the\ncase of patriotism, that entity is one’s patria,\none’s country; in the case of nationalism, that entity is\none’s natio, one’s nation (in the ethnic/cultural\nsense of the term). Thus patriotism and nationalism are understood as\nthe same type of set of beliefs and attitudes, and distinguished in\nterms of their objects, rather than the strength of those beliefs and\nattitudes, or as sentiment vs. theory. \nTo be sure, there is much overlap between country and nation, and\ntherefore between patriotism and nationalism; thus much that applies\nto one will also apply to the other. But when a country is not\nethnically homogeneous, or when a nation lacks a country of its own,\nthe two may part ways. \nPatriotism has had a fair number of critics. The harshest among them\nhave judged it deeply flawed in every important respect. In the\n19th century, Russian novelist and thinker Leo Tolstoy\nfound patriotism both stupid and immoral. It is stupid because every\npatriot holds his own country to be the best of all whereas,\nobviously, only one country can qualify. It is immoral because it\nenjoins us to promote our country’s interests at the expense of\nall other countries and by any means, including war, and is thus at\nodds with the most basic rule of morality, which tells us not to do to\nothers what we would not want them to do to us (Tolstoy 1987, 97).\nRecently, Tolstoy’s critique has been seconded by American\npolitical theorist George Kateb, who argues that patriotism is\n“a mistake twice over: it is typically a grave moral error and\nits source is typically a state of mental confusion” (Kateb\n2000, 901). Patriotism is most importantly expressed in a readiness to\ndie and to kill for one’s country. But a country “is not a\ndiscernible collection of discernible individuals”; it is rather\n“an abstraction … a compound of a few actual and many\nimaginary ingredients.” Specifically, in addition to being a\ndelimited territory, “it is also constructed out of transmitted\nmemories true and false; a history usually mostly falsely sanitized or\nfalsely heroized; a sense of kinship of a largely invented purity; and\nsocial ties that are largely invisible or impersonal, indeed abstract\n…” Therefore patriotism is “a readiness to die and\nto kill for an abstraction … for what is largely a figment of\nthe imagination” (907). \nSome of these objections can easily be countered. Even if full-fledged\npatriotism does involve a belief in one’s country’s\nmerits, it need not involve the belief that one’s country is\nbetter than all others. And the fact that a country is not a\ncollection of “discernible individuals” and that the\nsocial ties among compatriots are “largely invisible or\nimpersonal,” rather than palpable and face-to-face, does not\nshow that it is unreal or imaginary. As Benedict Anderson, who coined\nthe term “imagined community,” points out, “all\ncommunities larger than primordial villages of face-to-face contact\n… are imagined.” “Imagined community” is not\nthe opposite of “real community,” but rather of community\nwhose members have face-to-face relations (Anderson 1991, 6). \nHowever, there is another, more plausible line of criticism of\npatriotism focusing on its intellectual, rather than moral\ncredentials. Moreover, Tolstoy’s and Kateb’s arguments\nquestioning the moral legitimacy of patriotic partiality and those\nhighlighting the connection of patriotism with international tensions\nand war cannot be so easily refuted. \nWhen asked “why do you love your country?” or “why\nare you loyal to it?”, a patriot is likely to take the question\nto mean “what is so good about your country that you should love\nit, or be loyal to it?” and then adduce what she believes to be\nits virtues and achievements. This suggests that patriotism can be\njudged from the standpoint of ethics of belief – a set of norms\nfor evaluating our beliefs and other doxastic states. Simon Keller has\nexamined patriotism from this point of view, and found it wanting. \nKeller argues that whereas one’s love of and loyalty to a family\nmember or a friend may coexist with a low estimate of the\nperson’s qualities, patriotism involves endorsement of\none’s country. If the patriot is to endorse her country, she\nmust consider her beliefs about the country’s virtues and\nachievements to be based on some objectively valid standards of value\nand an unbiased examination of the country’s past and present\nrecord that leads to the conclusion that it lives up to those\nstandards. However, the patriot’s loyalty is not focused on her\ncountry simply because it instantiates a set of virtues a country can\nhave. If that were the case, and if a neighboring country turned out\nto have such virtues to an even higher degree, the patriot’s\nloyalty would be redirected accordingly. She is loyal to her country\nbecause that country, and only that country, is her country;\nhers is a loyalty “in the first instance.” Thus the\npatriot is motivated to think of the patria as blessed by all\nmanner of virtues and achievements whether the evidence, interpreted\nobjectively, warrants that or not. Accordingly, she forms beliefs\nabout her country in ways different from the ways in which she forms\nbeliefs about other countries. Moreover, she cannot admit this\nmotivation while at the same time remaining a patriot. This leads her\nto hide from herself the true source of some of the beliefs involved.\nThis is bad faith. Bad faith is bad; so is patriotism, as well as\nevery identity, individual or collective, constituted, in part, by\npatriotic loyalty. This, in Keller’s view, amounts to “a\nclear presumptive case against patriotism’s being a virtue and\nfor its being a vice” (Keller 2005, 587–88). \nThis portrayal does seem accurate as far as much patriotism as we know\nit is concerned. Yet Keller may be overstating his case as one against\npatriotism as such. When queried about one’s loyalty to\none’s country, couldn’t one say: “This is\nmy country, my home; I need no further reason to be\nloyal to it and show special concern for its well-being”? This\nmight not be a very satisfactory answer; we might agree with J.B.\nZimmermann that “the love for one’s country … is in\nmany cases no more than the love of an ass for its stall”\n(quoted in Nathanson 1993, 3). But however egocentric, irrational,\nasinine, surely it qualifies as patriotism. (In a later statement of\nhis argument (2007a, 80–81), Keller seems to be of two minds on\nthis point.) \nMany think of patriotism as a natural and appropriate expression of\nattachment to the country in which we were born and raised and of\ngratitude for the benefits of life on its soil, among its people, and\nunder its laws. They also consider patriotism an important component\nof our identity. Some go further, and argue that patriotism is morally\nmandatory, or even that it is the core of morality. There is, however,\na major tradition in moral philosophy which understands morality as\nessentially universal and impartial, and seems to rule out local,\npartial attachment and loyalty. Adherents of this tradition tend to\nthink of patriotism as a type of group\n egoism,\n a morally arbitrary partiality to “one’s own” at\nodds with demands of universal justice and common human solidarity. A\nrelated objection is that patriotism is exclusive in invidious and\ndangerous ways. Love of one’s own country characteristically\ngoes together with dislike of and hostility towards other countries.\nIt tends to encourage militarism, and makes for international tension\nand conflict. Tolstoy’s and Kateb’s moral objections to\npatriotism, mentioned above, are in line with this position. \nWhat, then, is the moral status of patriotism? The question does not\nadmit of a single answer. We can distinguish five types of patriotism,\nand each needs to be judged on its merits. \nMachiavelli is famous (or infamous) for teaching princes that, human\nnature being what it is, if they propose to do their job well, they\nmust be willing to break their promises, to deceive, dissemble, and\nuse violence, sometimes in cruel ways and on a large scale, when\npolitical circumstances require such actions. This may or may not be\nrelevant to the question of patriotism, depending on just what we take\nthe point of princely rule to be. A less well known part of\nMachiavelli’s teaching, however, is relevant; for he sought to\nimpart the same lesson to politicians and common citizens of a\nrepublic. “When the safety of one’s country wholly depends\non the decision to be taken, no attention should be paid either to\njustice or injustice, to kindness or cruelty, or to its being\npraiseworthy or ignominious” (Machiavelli 1998 [1518], 515). The\nparamount interests of one’s country override any moral\nconsideration with which they might come into conflict. \nThis type of patriotism is extreme, but by no means extremely rare. It\nis adopted much too often by politicians and common citizens alike\nwhen their country’s major interests are thought to be at stake.\nIt is encapsulated in the saying “our country, right or\nwrong,” at least on the simplest and most obvious construal of\nthis saying. Not much needs to be said about the moral standing of\nthis type of patriotism, as it amounts to rejection of morality.\n“Our country, right or wrong” cannot be\nright. \nIn his seminal lecture “Is Patriotism a Virtue?” Alasdair\nMacIntyre contrasts patriotism with the liberal commitment to certain\nuniversal values and principles. On the liberal view, where and from\nwhom I learn the principles of morality is just as irrelevant to their\ncontents and to my commitment to them, as where and from whom I learn\nthe principles of mathematics is irrelevant to their contents and my\nadherence to them. For MacIntyre, where and from whom I learn my\nmorality is of decisive importance both for my commitment to it and\nfor its very contents. \nThere is no morality as such; morality is always the morality of a\nparticular community. One can understand and internalize moral rules\nonly “in and through the way of life of [one’s]\ncommunity” (MacIntyre 1984, 8). Moral rules are justified in\nterms of certain goods they express and promote; but these goods, too,\nare always given as part and parcel of the way of life of a community.\nThe individual becomes a moral agent only when informed as such by his\ncommunity. He also lives and flourishes as one because he is sustained\nin his moral life by his community. “… I can\nonly be a moral agent because we are moral agents …\nDetached from my community, I will be apt to lose my hold upon all\ngenuine standards of judgment” (10–11). \nIf I can live and flourish as a moral agent only as a member of my\ncommunity, while playing the role this membership involves, then my\nvery identity is bound up with that of my community, its history,\ntraditions, institutions, and aspirations. Therefore, \nThis leads MacIntyre to conclude that patriotism is not to be\ncontrasted with morality; it is rather a central moral virtue, indeed\nthe bedrock of morality. \nThe object of patriotic loyalty is one’s country and polity; but\nthis does not mean that a patriot will support any government in power\nin her country. Here MacIntyre’s position is different from a\npopular version of patriotism that tends to conflate the two. The\npatriot’s allegiance, he says, is not to the status quo\nof power, but rather to “the nation conceived as a\nproject” (13). One can oppose one’s country’s\ngovernment in the name of the country’s true character, history,\nand aspirations. To that extent, this type of patriotism is critical\nand rational. But at least some practices and projects of the\npatria, some of its “large interests,” must be\nbeyond questioning and critical scrutiny. To that extent, MacIntyre\ngrants that what he considers true patriotism is “a\nfundamentally irrational attitude” (13). But a more rational and\ntherefore more constrained loyalty would be “emasculated,”\nrather than real patriotism. \nThis account of patriotism is exposed to several objections. One might\nquestion the communitarian foundations of MacIntyre’s case for\npatriotism: his view of the moral primacy of the community over the\nindividual. One might find fault with the step from communitarianism\nto patriotism: \nYet another objection would focus on the fundamentally irrational\ncharacter of robust patriotism: its insistence that “large\ninterests” of the patria must be beyond\nquestioning. \nMacIntyre concedes that “on occasion patriotism might require me\nto support and work for the success of some enterprise of my nation as\ncrucial to its overall project … when the success of that\nenterprise would not be in the best interests of mankind” (14).\nIf so, this type of patriotism would seem to involve the rejection of\nsuch basic moral notions as universal justice and common human\nsolidarity. \nTolstoy and other critics have argued that patriotism is incompatible\nwith these notions – that it is egoism writ large, an exclusive\nand ultimately aggressive concern for one’s country, and a major\ncause of international tensions and war. This is not a fair objection\nto patriotism as such. Patriotism is defined as a special\nconcern for one’s country’s well-being, and that is not\nthe same as an exclusive and aggressive concern for\nit. But the objection is pertinent, and has considerable force, when\nbrought up against the type of patriotism advocated by MacIntyre.\nMacIntyre’s patriot may promote his country’s interests in\na critical, and therefore non-exclusive way, over a range of issues.\nBut when it comes to those “large interests” of his\ncountry that are beyond criticism and must be supported in an\nirrational way, his concern will inevitably become exclusive, and most\nlikely aggressive too. If justice is understood in universal, rather\nthan parochial terms, if common human solidarity counts as a weighty\nmoral consideration, and if peace is of paramount importance and war\nis morally permissible only when it is just, then this kind of\npatriotism must be rejected. \nRejecting robust patriotism does not entail adopting sweeping\nimpartialism that acknowledges no special obligations, and allows no\npartiality, to “our own.” Nor does it entail adopting the\nmore restricted, cosmopolitan position, that allows no partiality to\nour own country and compatriots. There is considerable middle ground\nbetween these extremes. Exploring this middle ground has led some\nphilosophers to construct positions accommodating both the universal\nand the particular point of view – both the mandates of\nuniversal justice and claims of common humanity, and the concern for\nthe patria and compatriots. \nOne such position is “patriotism compatible with liberal\nmorality,” or “liberal patriotism” for short,\nadvocated by Marcia Baron (1989). Baron argues that the conflict\nbetween impartiality and partiality is not quite as deep as it may\nseem. Morality allows for both types of considerations, as they\npertain to different levels of moral deliberation. At one level, we\nare often justified in taking into account our particular commitments\nand attachments, including those to our country. At another level, we\ncan and ought to reflect on such commitments and attachments from a\nuniversal, impartial point of view, to delineate their proper scope\nand determine their weight. We can conclude, for example, “that\nwith respect to certain matters and within limits, it is good\nfor an American to judge as an American, and to put American interests\nfirst” (Baron 1989, 272). In such a case, partiality and\nparticular concerns are judged to be legitimate and indeed valuable\nfrom an impartial, universal point of view. This means that with\nrespect to those matters and within the same limits, it is also good\nfor a Cuban to judge as a Cuban and to put Cuban interests first, etc.\nActually, this is how we think of our special obligations to, and\npreferences for, our family, friends, or local community; this kind of\npartiality is legitimate, and indeed valuable, not only for us but for\nanyone. \nIn MacIntyre’s view, the type of partiality in general, and\npatriotism in particular, that is at work only at one level of moral\ndeliberation and against the background of impartiality at another,\nhigher level, lacks content and weight. For Baron, on the other hand,\nMacIntyre’s strongly particularistic type of patriotism is\nirrational and morally hazardous. Baron also finds problematic the\npopular understanding of patriotism which focuses on the\ncountry’s might and its interests as determined by whatever\ngovernment is in power. She emphasizes concern for the country’s\ncultural and moral excellence. By doing so, she argues, our patriotism\nwill leave room for serious, even radical criticism of our country,\nand will not be a force for dissension and conflict in the\ninternational arena. \nAnother middle-of-the-road view is “moderate patriotism”\npropounded by Stephen Nathanson (1989, 1993). He, too, rejects the\nchoice between MacIntyre’s robust patriotism and\ncosmopolitanism, and argues that impartiality required by morality\nallows for particular attachments and special obligations by\ndistinguishing different levels of moral thinking. A good example is\nprovided by the Ten Commandments, a major document of Western\nmorality. The wording of the commandments is for the most part\nuniversal, impartial; but they also tell us “honor your\nfather and your mother.” \nThe kind of patriotism defended by Nathanson and Baron is moderate in\nseveral distinct, but related respects. It is not unbridled: it does\nnot enjoin the patriot to promote his country’s interests under\nany circumstances and by any means. It acknowledges the constraints\nmorality imposes on the pursuit of our individual and collective\ngoals. For instance, it may require the patriot to fight for his\ncountry, but only in so far as the war is, and remains, just.\nAdherents of both extreme and robust patriotism will consider\nthemselves bound to fight for their country whether its cause be just\nor not. Extreme patriots will also fight for it in whatever way it\ntakes to win. Whether adherents of MacIntyre’s robust\npatriotism, too, will do so is a moot point. If they do not, that will\nbe because the morality of their own community places certain\nconstraints on warfare, whether of a particularistic type (“a\nGerman officer does not execute POWs”), or by incorporating some\nuniversalistic moral precepts (“an officer does not execute\nPOWs”). \nModerate patriotism is not exclusive. Its adherent will show special\nconcern for his country and compatriots, but that will not prevent him\nfrom showing concern for other countries and their inhabitants.\nMoreover, this kind of patriotism allows for the possibility that\nunder certain circumstances the concern for human beings in general\nwill override the concern for one’s country and compatriots.\nSuch patriotism is compatible with a decent degree of humanitarianism.\nBy contrast, both extreme and robust patriotism give greater weight to\nthe (substantial) interests of one’s country and compatriots\nthan to those of other countries and their inhabitants whenever these\ninterests come into conflict. \nFinally, moderate patriotism is not uncritical, unconditional, or\negocentric. For an adherent of this type of patriotism, it is not\nenough that the country is her country. She will also expect\nit to live up to certain standards and thereby deserve her support,\ndevotion, and special concern for its well-being. When it fails to do\nso, she will withhold support. Adherents of both extreme and robust\npatriotism, on the other hand, love their country unconditionally, and\nstand by it whatever it does as long as its “safety” or\nits “large interests” more generally are concerned. \nBaron and Nathanson have found a middle ground between sweeping\ncosmopolitanism that allows for no attachment and loyalty to\none’s country and compatriots, and extreme or robust patriotism\nthat rejects universal moral considerations (except those that have\nbecome part and parcel of one’s country’s morality). They\nhave shown that the main objections usually advanced against\npatriotism as such apply only to its extreme or robust varieties, but\nnot to its “liberal” or “moderate” versions.\nThe latter type of patriotism need not conflict with impartial justice\nor common human solidarity. It will therefore be judged morally\nunobjectionable by all except some adherents of a strict type of\n cosmopolitanism. \nHowever, both Baron and Nathanson fail to distinguish clearly between\nshowing that their preferred type of patriotism is morally\nunobjectionable and showing that it is morally required or virtuous,\nand sometimes seem to be assuming that by showing the former, they are\nalso showing the latter. Yet there is a gap between the two claims,\nand the latter, stronger case for moderate patriotism still needs to\nbe made. \nWhat is the case for the claim that moderate patriotism is morally\nmandatory – that we have a duty of special concern for the\nwell-being of our country and compatriots, similar to special duties\nto family or friends? \nGratitude is probably the most popular among the grounds\nadduced for patriotic duty. Echoing Socrates in Plato’s\nCrito (51c-51d), Maurizio Viroli writes: “… We\nhave a moral obligation towards our country because we are indebted to\nit. We owe our country our life, our education, our language, and, in\nthe most fortunate cases, our liberty. If we want to be moral persons,\nwe must return what we have received, at least in part, by serving the\ncommon good” (Viroli 1995, 9). \nBoth Socrates and Viroli are exaggerating the benefits bestowed on us\nby our country; surely any gratitude owed for being born or brought up\nis owed to parents, rather than patria. But there are\nimportant benefits we have received from our country; the argument is\nthat we are bound to show gratitude for them, and that the appropriate\nway to do so is to show special concern for the well-being of the\ncountry and compatriots. \nOne worry here is that considerations of gratitude normally arise in\ninterpersonal relations. We also speak of gratitude to large and\nimpersonal entities – our school, profession, or even our\ncountry – but that seems to be an abbreviated way of referring\nto gratitude to particular persons who have acted on behalf of these\nentities. A debt of gratitude is not incurred by any benefit\nreceived. If a benefit is conferred inadvertently, or advisedly but\nfor the wrong reason (e.g. for the sake of the benefactor’s\npublic image), gratitude will be misplaced. We owe a moral debt of\ngratitude (rather than the mere “thank you” of good\nmanners) only to those who confer benefits on us deliberately and for\nthe right reason, namely out of concern for our own good. And we\ncannot talk with confidence about the reasons a large and complex\ngroup or institution has for its actions. \nPerhaps we can think of compatriots as an aggregate of individuals. Do\nwe owe them a debt of gratitude for the benefits of life among them?\nAgain, it depends on the reason for their law-abiding behavior and\nsocial cooperation generally. But there is no single reason common to\nall or even most of them. Some do their part without giving much\nthought to the reasons for doing so; others believe that doing so is,\nin the long run, the most prudent policy; still others act out of\naltruistic motives. Only the last group – surely a tiny minority\n– would be a proper object of our gratitude. \nMoreover, gratitude is appropriate only for a benefit conferred\nfreely, as a gift, and not as a quid pro quo. But most of the\nbenefits we receive from our country are of the latter sort: benefits\nwe have paid for by our own law-abiding behavior in general, and\nthrough taxation in particular. \nThe benefits one has received from her country might be considered\nrelevant to the duty of patriotism in a different way: as raising the\nissue of fairness. One’s country is not a land\ninhabited by strangers to whom we owe nothing beyond what we owe to\nany other human being. It is rather a common enterprise that produces\nand distributes a wide range of benefits. These benefits are made\npossible by cooperation of those who live in the country, participate\nin the enterprise, owe and render allegiance to the polity. The rules\nthat regulate the cooperation and determine the distribution of\nburdens and benefits enjoin, among other things, special concern for\nthe well-being of compatriots which is not due to outsiders. As\nRichard Dagger puts it: \nThis argument conflates the issue of patriotism with that of\n political obligation,\n and the notion of a patriot with that of a citizen. Unlike informal\ncooperation among tenants in a building, for instance, cooperation on\nthe scale of a country is regulated by a set of laws. To do\none’s part within such a cooperative enterprise is just to obey\nthe laws, to act as a citizen. Whether we have a moral duty to obey\nthe laws of our country is one of the central issues in modern\npolitical philosophy, discussed under the heading of political\nobligation. One major account of political obligation is that of\nfairness. If successful, that account shows that we do have a moral\nduty to abide by the laws of our country, to act as citizens, and that\nthis duty is one of fairness. To fail to abide by one’s\ncountry’s laws is to fail to reciprocate, to take advantage of\ncompatriots, to act unfairly towards them. But whereas a patriot is\nalso a citizen, a citizen is not necessarily a patriot. Patriotism\ninvolves special concern for the patria and\ncompatriots, a concern that goes beyond what the laws\nobligate one to do, beyond what one does as a citizen; that\nis, beyond what one ought, in fairness, to do. Failing to\nshow that concern, however, cannot be unfair – except\non the question-begging assumption that, in addition to state law,\ncooperation on this scale is also based on, and regulated by, a moral\nrule enjoining special concern for the well-being of the country and\ncompatriots. Dagger asserts that the claim our compatriots have on us\n“extends to include” such concern, but provides no\nargument in support of this extension. \nSome philosophers seek to ground patriotic duty in its good\nconsequences (see the entry on\n consequentialism).\n The duty of special concern for the well-being of our country and\ncompatriots, just like other duties, universal and special, is\njustified by the good consequences of its adoption. Special duties\nmediate our fundamental, universal duties and make possible their most\neffective discharge. They establish a division of moral labor,\nnecessary because our capacity of doing good is limited by our\nresources and circumstances. Each of us can normally be of greater\nassistance to those who are in some way close to us than to those who\nare not. By attending first to “our own,” we at the same\ntime promote the good of humanity in the best way possible. \nPatriots will find this account of their love of and loyalty to their\ncountry alien to what they feel patriotism is all about. It presents\nthe duty of special concern for the well-being of one’s country\nand compatriots as a device for assigning to individuals some\nuniversal duties. Patriotic duty owes its moral force to the moral\nforce of those universal duties. But if so, then, as a proponent of\nthis understanding of patriotism concedes, “it turns out that\n‘our fellow countrymen’ are not so very special after\nall” (Goodin 1988, 679). They merely happen to be the\nbeneficiaries of the most effective way of putting into practice our\nconcern for human beings in general. The special relationship between\nthe patriot and the patria and compatriots – the\nrelationship of love and identification – has been\ndissolved. \nThere is also a view of patriotic duty that, in contrast to the\nconsequentialist account, does not dissolve, but rather highlight this\nrelationship. That is the view of patriotism as an associative\nduty (see the entry on\n special obligations,\n section 4). It is based on an understanding of special relationships\nas intrinsically valuable and involving duties of special concern for\nthe well-being of those we are related to. Such duties are not means\nof creating or maintaining those relationships, but rather their part\nand parcel, and can only be understood, and justified, as such, just\nas those relationships can only be understood as involving the special\nduties pertaining to them (while involving much else besides). For\ninstance, one who denies that she has an obligation of special concern\nfor the well-being of her friend shows that she no longer perceives\nand treats the person concerned as a friend, that (as far as she is\nconcerned) the friendship is gone. One who denies that people in\ngeneral have a duty of special concern for the well-being of their\nfriends shows that she does not understand what friendship is. \nAndrew Mason has offered an argument for the duty of special concern\nfor the well-being of compatriots based on the value embodied in our\nrelationship to compatriots, that of common citizenship. By\n“citizenship” he does not mean mere legal status, but\ntakes the term in a moral sense, which involves equal standing.\nCitizenship in this sense is an intrinsically valuable relationship,\nand grounds certain special duties fellow citizens have to one\nanother. Now citizenship obviously has considerable instrumental\nvalue; but how is it valuable in itself? \nMason goes on to claim: \nThe first of these two special duties can be put aside, as it is not\nspecific to patriotism, but rather pertains to citizenship. It is the\nsecond that is at issue. If we indeed have a duty of special concern\ntowards compatriots, and if that is an associative duty, that is\nbecause our association with them is intrinsically valuable and bound\nup with this duty. The claim about the intrinsic value of our\nassociation might be thought a moot point. But even if it were\nconceded, one might still resist the claim concerning the alleged\nduty. If someone were to deny that she has a duty of special\nconcern for the well-being of her country and compatriots, beyond what\nthe laws of her country mandate and beyond the concern she has for\nhumans and humanity, would she thereby cease to be a citizen (in the\nsense involving equal standing)? If she were to deny that citizens\ngenerally have such an obligation, would that betray lack of\nunderstanding of what citizenship (in the relevant sense) is? If she\ncame across two strangers in a life-threatening situation and could\nonly save one, would she have a prima facie moral duty to\nsave the one who was a compatriot? Mason’s position commits him\nto answering “yes” in each case, but all three claims are\nimplausible (Primoratz 2009). \nAll the main arguments for the claim that patriotism is a duty, then,\nare exposed to serious objections. Unless a new, more convincing case\nfor patriotism can be made, we have no good reason to think that\npatriotism is a moral duty. \nIf not a duty, is patriotism morally valuable? Someone showing concern\nfor the well-being of others well beyond the degree of concern for\nothers required of all of us is considered a morally better person\nthan the rest of us (other things equal), an example of supererogatory\nvirtue. Patriotism is a special concern for the well-being of\none’s country and compatriots, a concern beyond what we owe\nother people and communities. Isn’t a patriot, then, a morally\nbetter person than the rest of us (other things equal)? Isn’t\npatriotism a supererogatory virtue? \nOne standard example of such virtue is the type of concern for those\nin an extreme plight shown by the late Mother Theresa, or by Doctors\nWithout Borders. But they are exemplars of moral virtue for the same\nreason that makes a more modest degree of concern for others a moral\nduty falling on all of us. The same moral value, sympathy for and\nassistance to people in need, grounds a certain degree of concern for\nothers as a general moral duty and explains why a significantly higher\ndegree of such concern is a moral ideal. This explanation, however,\ndoes not apply in the case of patriotism. Patriotism is not but\nanother extension of the duty of concern for others; it is a special\nconcern for my country because it is my country, for\nmy compatriots because they are my compatriots.\nUnlike Mother Theresa and Doctors Without Borders, whose concern is\nfor all destitute, sick, dying persons they can reach, the concern of\nthe patriot is by definition selective; and the selection is performed\nby the word “my.” But the word “my” cannot, by\nitself, play the critical role in an argument showing that a certain\nstance is morally valuable. If it could, other types of\npartialism, such as tribalism, racism, or sexism, would by the same\ntoken prove morally valuable too. \nIf patriotism is neither a moral duty nor a supererogatory virtue,\nthen all its moral pretensions have been deflated. It has no positive\nmoral significance. There is nothing to be said for it,\nmorally speaking. We all have various preferences for places and\npeople, tend to identify with many groups, large and small, to think\nof them as in some sense ours, and to show a degree of special concern\nfor their members. But however important in other respects these\npreferences, identifications, and concerns might be, they lack\npositive moral import. They are morally permissible as long as they\nare kept within certain limits, but morally indifferent in themselves.\nThe same is true of patriotism (Primoratz 2002). \nAll four types of patriotism reviewed so far seek to defend and\npromote what might be termed the worldly, i.e. non-moral, interests of\nthe patria: its political stability, military power, riches,\ninfluence in the international arena, and cultural vibrancy. They\ndiffer with regard to the lengths to which these interests will be\npromoted: adherents of extreme and robust patriotism will ultimately\ngo to any length, whereas those whose patriotism is moderate or\ndeflated will respect the limits universal moral considerations set to\nthis pursuit. Marcia Baron also calls for expanding patriotic concern\nfor the flourishing of one’s country to include its “moral\nflourishing” (see 2.2.3 above). \nThus Baron’s position is half-way between the usual, worldly\nkind of patriotism, and what might be described as its distinctively\nethical type. The latter would put aside the country’s\nwell-being in a mundane, non-moral sense, and would focus instead on\nits distinctively moral well-being, its moral identity and integrity.\nA patriot of this sort would not express his love for the\npatria by seeking to husband the country’s resources\nand preserve its natural beauty and its historical heritage, or make\nit rich, powerful, culturally preeminent, or influential on the world\nscene. Instead, he would seek to make sure that the country lives up\nto moral requirements and promotes moral values, both at home and\ninternationally. He would work for a just and humane society at home,\nand seek to ensure that the country acts justly beyond its borders,\nand shows common human solidarity towards those in need, however\ndistant and unfamiliar. He would also be concerned with the\ncountry’s past moral record and its implications for the\npresent. He would support projects exploring the dark chapters of the\ncountry’s history, acknowledging the wrongs perpetrated in the\npast and responding to them in appropriate ways, whether by offering\napologies or making amends, and by making sure such wrongs are not\nperpetrated again. \nA patriot of this, distinctively ethical type, would want to see\njustice done, rights respected, human solidarity at work at any time\nand in any place. But her patriotism would be at work in a concern\nthat her country be guided by these moral principles and\nvalues which is more sustained and more deeply felt than her concern\nthat these principles and values should be put into practice\ngenerally. She would consider her own moral identity as bound up with\nthat of her country, and the moral record of the patria as\nhers too. Unlike a patriot of the more worldly type, she might not\nfeel great pride in her country’s worldly merits and\nachievements. She would be proud of the country’s moral record,\nwhen it inspires pride. But her patriotism would be expressed, above\nall, in a critical approach to her country and compatriots: she would\nfeel entitled, and indeed called, to submit them to critical moral\nscrutiny, and to do so qua patriot. \nWhile we have no moral reason to be patriots of the more usual,\nmundane kind, we do have reason to show special concern for our own\ncountry’s moral well-being. As a rule, when someone is wronged,\nsomeone else benefits from that. When a country maintains an unjust or\ninhumane practice, or enacts and enforces an unjust or inhumane law or\npolicy, at least some, and sometimes many of its citizens reap\nbenefits from it. Sometimes such a practice, legislation or policy\naffects people beyond the country’s borders; in such cases, the\npopulation as a whole may benefit. The responsibility for the\ninjustice or lack of basic human solidarity lies with those who make\nthe decisions and those who implement them. It also lies with those\nwho give support to such decisions and their implementation. But some\nresponsibility in this connection may also devolve on those who have\nno part in the making of the decisions or in their implementation, nor\neven provide support, but accept the benefits such a practice, law or\npolicy generates. \nA degree of complicity may also accrue to those who have no part in\ndesigning or putting into effect immoral practices, laws or policies,\ndo not support them or benefit from them, but do benefit in various\nways from being citizens of the country. One may derive significant\npsychological benefit from membership in and identification with a\nsociety or polity: from the sense of belonging, support and security\nsuch membership and identification afford. If one accepts such\nbenefits, while knowing about the immoral practices, laws or policies\nat issue, or having no excuse for not knowing about them, that, too,\nmay be seen as implicating him in those wrongs. To be sure, he makes\nno causal contribution to those wrongdoings, has no control over their\ncourse, and does not accept benefits from them. But in accepting\nbenefits from his association with the wrongdoers, he may be seen as\nunderwriting those wrongs and joining the class of those properly\nblamed. His complicity is lesser and the blame to be laid at his door\nis lesser too – but he still bears some moral\nresponsibility and deserves some moral blame on that account.\nHe cannot say in good faith: “Those wrongs have nothing to do\nwith me. I am in no way implicated in them.” \nIf this is correct, we have reason to develop and exercise a special\nconcern for the moral identity and integrity of our country. By doing\nso, we will be attending to an important aspect of our own moral\nidentity and integrity. While patriotism of the more usual, worldly\nkind is neither morally required nor virtuous, but at best morally\npermitted, ethical patriotism can, under certain fairly common\ncircumstances, be a moral duty (Primoratz 2006). \nWhile moral philosophers debate the standing of patriotism as an\ninstance of the problem of reconciling universal moral considerations\nwith particular attachments and loyalties, political theorists are\nprimarily interested in patriotism as an ethos of the well-ordered\npolity and an antidote to nationalism. Since the rise of the\nnation-state, it has been widely held that some form of nationalism is\nindispensable as a pre-political basis of the unity of the state that\nmakes for solidarity among citizens and provides them with motivation\nto participate in public life and make sacrifices for the common good.\nAs Roger Scruton put it, “for a liberal state to be secure, the\ncitizens must understand the national interest as something\nother than the interest of the state. Only the first can\nevoke in them the sacrificial spirit upon which the second\ndepends” (Scruton 1990, 319). But in the course of the\n20th century nationalism was deeply compromised. That has\nled political theorists to look for alternatives. Some have argued\nthat an emphatically political patriotism could perform the unifying\nfunction of nationalism while avoiding its perils. This “new\npatriotism” puts aside, or at least de-emphasizes, pre-political\nties such as common ancestry, language, or culture, and enjoins love\nof, and loyalty to, one’s political community, its laws and\ninstitutions, and the rights and liberties they make possible. \nIn view of the disastrous record of national socialism, it is not\nsurprising that German thinkers in particular should be suspicious of\npatriotism as long as it has not been dissociated from nationalism. As\nearly as 1959, political theorist Dolf Sternberger called for a new\nunderstanding of the concept of fatherland. “The fatherland is\nthe ‘republic,’ which we create for ourselves. The\nfatherland is the constitution, to which we give life. The fatherland\nis the freedom which we truly enjoy only when we ourselves promote it,\nmake use of it, and stand guard over it” (Sternberger 1990, 12).\nIn 1979, on the 30th anniversary of the Federal Republic,\nhe coined the term “constitutional patriotism”\n(Verfassungspatriotismus) to describe the loyalty to the\npatria understood in these terms (13–16). The term was\nlater adopted by Jürgen Habermas in the context of a case for\novercoming pre-political, i.e. national and cultural, loyalties in\npublic life, and supplanting them with a new, postnational, purely\npolitical identity embodied in the laws and institutions of a free and\ndemocratic state. Habermas argues that this identity, expressed in and\nreinforced by constitutional patriotism, can provide a solid\nfoundation for such a state, given the ethnic and cultural\nheterogeneity characteristic of most countries in western Europe. It\ncan also facilitate further European integration, and provide an\nantidote to the “chauvinism of affluence” tempting these\ncountries (Habermas 1990). \nConstitutional patriotism is the most widely discussed, but not the\nsole variety of “new patriotism.” Another is\n“covenanted patriotism” advocated by John H. Schaar as\nappropriate for countries whose population is much too ethnically and\nculturally heterogeneous to allow for “natural\npatriotism.” Schaar’s paradigmatic example is the United\nStates, whose citizens “were bonded together not by blood or\nreligion, not by tradition or territory, not by the walls and\ntraditions of a city, but by a political idea … by a covenant,\nby dedication to a set of principles and by an exchange of promises to\nuphold and advance certain commitments” (Schaar 1981, 291).\nStill another variety is the “patriotism of liberty”\npropounded by Maurizio Viroli, who calls for a return to what\npatriotism used to be before it was harnessed in the service of the\nnation-state and submerged in nationalism: love of the laws and\ninstitutions of one’s polity and the common liberty they make\npossible (Viroli 1995). \nThis new, emphatically political version of patriotism has been met\nwith both sympathy and skepticism. Those sympathetic to it have been\ndiscussing the prospects of a European constitutional patriotism (see\nMüller 2007, 93–139). Skeptics have argued that patriotism\ndisconnected from all pre-political attachments and identities can\ngenerate only much too thin a sense of identity and much too weak a\nmotivation for political participation – that, thus understood,\n“patriotism is not enough” (Canovan 2000).","contact.mail":"igorprim@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
