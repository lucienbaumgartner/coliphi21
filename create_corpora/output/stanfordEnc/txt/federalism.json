Unlike\nin a unitary state, sovereignty in federal political orders is\nnon-centralized, often constitutionally, between at least two levels\nso that units at each level have final authority and can be self\ngoverning in some issue area. Citizens thus have political obligations\nto, or have their rights secured by, two authorities. The division of\npower between the member unit and center may vary, typically the\ncenter has powers regarding defense and foreign policy, but member\nunits may also have international roles. The decision-making bodies of\nmember units may also participate in central decision-making\nbodies. Much recent philosophical attention is spurred by renewed\npolitical interest in federalism and backlashes against particular instances, coupled with empirical findings concerning the requisite and legitimate basis for stability and trust among citizens in federal political orders. Philosophical\ncontributions have addressed the dilemmas and opportunities facing\nCanada, Australia, Europe, Russia, Iraq, Nepal and Nigeria, to mention\njust a few areas where federal arrangements are seen as interesting\nsolutions to accommodate differences among populations divided by\nethnic or cultural cleavages yet seeking a common, often democratic,\npolitical order.\n\n\n\nMuch valuable scholarship explicates the central terms\n‘federalism’, ‘federation’ and ‘federal\nsystems’ (cf. Wheare 1964, King 1982, Elazar 1987, Elazar 1987a,\nRiker 1993, Watts 1998). \n\nA federal political order is here taken to be “the\ngenus of political organization that is marked by the combination of\nshared rule and self-rule” (Watts 1998,\n120). Federalism is the theory or advocacy of such an order,\nincluding principles for dividing final authority between member units\nand the common institutions.  \nA federation is one species of such a federal order; other\nspecies are unions, confederations, leagues and decentralised\nunions—and hybrids such as the present European Union (Elazar\n1987, Watts 1998). A federation in this sense involves\na territorial division of power between constituent\nunits—sometimes called ‘provinces’,\n‘cantons’, possibly ‘cities’, or confusingly ‘states’—and a\ncommon government. This division of power is typically entrenched in a\nconstitution which neither a member unit nor the common government can\nalter unilaterally. The member unit and the common government both\nhave direct effect on the citizenry—the common government\noperates “on the individual citizens composing the nation”\n(Federalist Paper 39)—and the authorities of both are directly\nelected (Watts 1998, 121). In comparison, decentralized authority in\nunitary states can typically be revoked by the central legislature at\nwill. Many multilevel forms of governance may also be revised by units at one level without consent by bodies at other levels. Such entrenchments notwithstanding, some centralization often occurs owing to the constitutional interpretations by a federal level\ncourt in charge of settling conflicts regarding the scopes of final\nlegislative and/or judicial authority. \n\nIn contrast, ‘confederation’ has come to mean a political order\nwith a weaker center than a federation, often dependent on the\nconstituent units (Watts 1998, 121). Typically, in a confederation a)\nmember units may legally exit, b) the center only exercises authority\ndelegated by member units, c) the center is subject to member unit\nveto on many issues, d) center decisions bind member units but not\ncitizens directly, e) the center lacks an independent fiscal or\nelectoral base, and/or f) the member units do not cede\nauthority permanently to the center.  Confederations are often based\non agreements for specific tasks, and the common government may be\ncompletely exercised by delegates of the member unit governments. Thus\nmany would count as confederations the North American states during\n1776–1787, Switzerland 1291–1847, and the present European\nUnion—though it has several elements typical of\nfederations. \n\nIn symmetric (con)federations the member\nunits have the same bundles of powers, while in asymmetric\n(con)federations such as Russia, Canada, the\nEuropean Union, Spain, or India the bundles may be different among\nmember units; some member units may for instance have special rights\nregarding language or culture. Some asymmetric arrangements involve\none smaller state and a larger, where the smaller partakes in\ngoverning the larger while retaining sovereignty on some issues\n(Elazar 1987, Watts 1998).  \n\nIf the decisions made centrally do not involve member units at all, we\nmay speak of separate (split or compact)\nfederalism. The USA is often given as example, since the two Senators\nfrom each state are not representing or selected by member unit (i.e. State)\nauthorities but by electors voted directly by citizens—though\nthis is by member unit decision (U.S. Constitution Art. II Section 1;\ncf. Dahl 2001). Federations can involve member units in central\ndecision-making in at least two different ways in various forms of\ninterlocking (or cooperative) federalism. Member\nunit representatives can participate within central bodies—in\ncabinets or legislatures—(collective agency\ncompositional arrangement); in addition they often constitute one\ncentral body that interacts with other such bodies, for instance where\nmember unit government representatives form an Upper House with power\nto veto or postpone decisions by majority or qualified majority vote\n(divided agency/relational arrangements). \n\nSeveral authors identify two quite distinct processes that lead to a federal political order (Friedrich 1968, Buchanan 1995, Stepan 1999 and\nothers).  Independent states may aggregate by ceding or pooling\nsovereign powers in certain domains for the sake of goods otherwise\nunattainable, such as security or economic prosperity. Such coming\ntogether federal political orders are typically arranged to\nconstrain the center and prevent majorities from overriding a member\nunit.  Examples include the present USA, Canada, Switzerland, and\nAustralia. Holding together federal political orders develop\nfrom unitary states, as governments devolve authority to alleviate\nthreats of unrest or secession by territorially clustered\nminorities. Such federal political orders often grant some member\nunits particular domains of sovereignty e.g. over language and\ncultural rights in an asymmetric federation, while\nmaintaining broad scope of action for the central government and\nmajorities. Examples include India, Belgium and Spain. \n\nIn addition to territorially organized federal political orders, other\ninteresting alternatives to unitary states occur\nwhen non-territorial member units are constituted by groups\nsharing ethnic, religious or other characteristics. These systems are\nsometimes referred to as ‘non-territorial’\nfederations. Karl Renner and Otto Bauer explored such arrangements for\ngeographically dispersed cultural minorities, allowing them some\ncultural and “personal” autonomy without territorial self\nrule (Bauer 1903; Renner 1907; Bottomore and Goode 1978; cf. Tamir\n1993 and Nimni 2005). Consociations consist of somewhat insulated groups in\nmember units who in addition are represented in central institutions\noften governing by unanimity rather than by majority (Lijphart 1977).\n \nA wide-spread interest among political philosophers in topics\nconcerning the centralised nation state have fuelled attention to\nhistorical contributions on unitary sovereignty. However, we can also\nidentify a steady stream of contributions to the philosophy of\nfederalism, also by those more well known for their arguments\nconcerning centralised power (cf. Karmis and Norman 2005 for such\nreadings). \nSeveral of the early contributors to federalist thought explored the\nrationale and weaknesses of centralised states as they emerged and\ndeveloped in the 17th and 18th century. Johannes Althusius\n(1557–1630) is often regarded as the father of modern federalist\nthought. He argued in Politica Methodice Digesta (Althusius\n1603) for autonomy of his city Emden, both against its Lutheran\nprovincial Lord and against the Catholic Emperor.  Althusius was\nstrongly influenced by French Huguenots and Calvinism. As a permanent\nminority in several states, Calvinists developed a doctrine of\nresistance as the right and duty of “natural leaders” to\nresist tyranny. Orthodox Calvinists insisted on sovereignty in the\nsocial circles subordinate only to God's laws. The French Protestant\nHuguenots developed a theory of legitimacy further, presented 1579 by\nan author with the telling pseudonym “Junius Brutus”\nin Vindiciae Contra Tyrannos. The people, regarded as a\ncorporate body in territorial hierarchical communities, has a\nGod-granted right to resist rulers without rightful claim. Rejecting\ntheocracy, Althusius developed a non-sectarian, non-religious\ncontractualist political theory of federations that prohibited state\nintervention even for purposes of promoting the right\nfaith. Accommodation of dissent and diversity prevailed over any\ninterest in subordinating political powers to religion or vice\nversa. \n\nSince humans are fundamentally dependent on others for the reliable\nprovision of requirements of a comfortable and holy life, we require\ncommunities and associations that are both instrumentally and\nintrinsically important for supporting [subsidia] our\nneeds. Families, guilds, cities, provinces, states and other\nassociations owe their legitimacy and claims to political power to\ntheir various roles in enabling a holy life, rather than to\nindividuals' interest in autonomy.  Each association claims autonomy\nwithin its own sphere against intervention by other\nassociations. Borrowing a term originally used for the alliance\nbetween God and men, Althusius holds that associations enter into\nsecular agreements—pactum foederis—to live\ntogether in mutual benevolence. \nSeveral early contributors explored what we may now regard as various\nspecies of federal political orders, partly with an eye to resolving\ninter-state conflicts. \nLudolph Hugo (ca. 1630–1704) was the first to distinguish\nconfederations based on alliances, decentralized unitary states such\nas the Roman Empire, and federations, characterized by ‘double\ngovernments’ with territorial division of powers, in De\nStatu Regionum Germanie (1661) (cf. Elazar 1998; Riley 1976). \n\nIn The Spirit of Laws (1748) Charles de Secondat, Baron de\nMontesquieu (1689–1755) argued for confederal arrangements as\ncombining the best of small and large political units, without the\ndisadvantages of either. On the one hand they could provide the\nadvantages of small states such as republican participation and\nliberty understood as non-domination—that is, security against\nabuse of power. At the same time confederal orders secure the benefits\nof larger states such as military security, without the risks of small\nand large states. A ‘confederate republic’ with separation\nof powers allows sufficient homogeneity and identification within\nsufficiently small member units. The member units in turn pool powers\nsufficient to secure external security, reserving the right to secede\n(Book 9, 1). Member units serve as checks on each other, since other\nmember units may intervene to quell insurrection and power abuse in\none member unit. These themes reoccur in later contributions, up to\nand including discussions concerning the European Union (cf. Levy\n2004, 2005, 2007). \n\nDavid Hume (1711–1776) disagreed with Montesquieu that smaller\nsize is better. Instead, “in a large democracy … there is\ncompass and room enough to refine the democracy.” In “Idea\nof a Perfect Commonwealth” (Hume 1752) Hume recommended a\nfederal arrangement for deliberation of laws involving both member\nunit and central legislatures. Member units enjoy several powers and\npartake in central decisions, but their laws and court judgments can\nalways be overruled by the central bodies, hence it seems that\nHume’s model is not federal as the term is used here.  He held\nthat such a numerous and geographically large system would do better\nthan small cities in preventing decisions based on “intrigue,\nprejudice or passion” against the public interest. \n\nSeveral 18th century peace plans for Europe recommended confederal\narrangements. The 1713 Peace Plan of Abbé Charles de\nSaint-Pierre (1658–1743) would allow intervention in member\nunits to quell rebellion and wars on non-members to force them to join\nan established confederation, and required unanimity for changes to\nthe agreement. \n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778) presented and critiqued\nSaint-Pierre’s proposal, listing several conditions including\nthat all major powers must be members, that the joint legislation must be\nbinding, that the joint forces must be stronger than any single state,\nand that secession must be illegal. Again, unanimity was required for\nchanges to the agreement. \n\nImmanuel Kant (1724–1804) defended a confederation for peace in\nOn Perpetual Peace (1796). His Second Definite Article of a\nPerpetual Peace holds that the right of nations shall be based on a\npacific federation among free states rather than a peace treaty or an\ninternational state: “This federation does not aim to acquire any power\nlike that of a state, but merely to preserve and secure the freedom of\neach state in itself, along with that of the other confederated states,\nalthough this does not mean that they need to submit to public laws and\nto a coercive power which enforces them, as do men in a state of\nnature.” \nThe discussions surrounding the U.S. Constitutional Convention of 1787\nmarks a clear development in federal thought. A central feature is\nthat federations were seen as uniting not only member units as in\nconfederations, but also the citizenry directly.  \nThe Articles of Confederation of 1781 among the 13 American states\nfighting British rule had established a center too weak for law\nenforcement, defense and for securing interstate commerce. What has\nbecome known as the U.S. Constitutional Convention met May\n25–September 17, 1787. It was explicitly restricted to revise the\nArticles, but ended up recommending more fundamental changes. The\nproposed constitution prompted widespread debate and arguments\naddressing the benefits and risks of federalism versus confederal\narrangements, leading eventually to the Constitution that took effect\nin 1789. \n\nThe “Anti-federalists” were fearful of undue\ncentralization. They worried that the powers of central authorities\nwere not sufficiently constrained e.g., by a bill of rights (John\nDeWitt 1787, Richard Henry Lee) that was eventually ratified\nin 1791. They also feared that the center might gradually usurp the\nmember units’ powers. Citing Montesquieu, another pseudonymous\n‘Brutus’ doubted whether a republic of such geographical\nsize with so many inhabitants with conflicting interests could avoid\ntyranny and would allow common deliberation and decision based on\nlocal knowledge (Brutus (Robert Yates?) 1787). \n\nIn The Federalist Papers, James\nMadison (1751–1836), Alexander Hamilton (1755–1804) and John Jay\n(1745–1829) argued vigorously for the suggested model of interlocking\nfederal arrangements (Federalist 10, 45, 51, 62). Madison and Hamilton\nagreed with Hume that the risk of tyranny by passionate majorities was\nreduced in larger republics where member units of shared interest could\nand would check each other: “A rage for paper money, for an abolition\nof debts, for an equal division of property, or for any improper or\nwicked project, will be less likely to pervade the whole body of the\nUnion than a particular member of it.” (Federalist 10). Splitting\nsovereignty between member unit and center would also protect\nindividuals’ rights against abuse by authorities at either level,\nor so believed Hamilton, quoting Montesquieu at length to this effect\n(Federalist 9). \n\nNoting the problems of allocating powers correctly, Madison\nsupported placing some authority with member units since they would be\nbest fit to address “local circumstances and lesser\ninterests” otherwise neglected by the center (Federalist 37). \n\nMadison and Hamilton urged centralized powers of defense and\ninterstate commerce (Federalist 11, 23), and argued for the need to\nsolve coordination and assurance problems of partial compliance,\nthrough two new means: Centralized enforcement and direct applicability\nof central decisions to individuals (Federalist 16, also noted by\nTocqueville 1835–40). They were wary of granting member units veto power\ntypical of confederal arrangements, since that would render the center\nweak and cause “tedious delays; continual negotiation and\nintrigue; contemptible compromises of the public good.” (Madison\nand Hamilton, Federalist 22; and cf. 20). \n\nThey were particularly concerned to address worries of undue\ncentralization, arguing that such worries should be addressed not by\nconstraining the extent of power in the relevant fields, such as\ndefense, but instead by the composition of the central authority\n(Federalist 31). They also claimed that the people would maintain\nstronger “affection, esteem, and reverence” towards the member unit\ngovernment owing to its public visibility in the day-to-day\nadministration of criminal and civil justice (Federalist 17). \n\nJohn Stuart Mill (1806–1873), in chapter 17 of Considerations on\nRepresentative Government (1861), recommended federations among\n“portions of mankind” not disposed to live under a common government,\nto prevent wars among themselves and protect against aggression. He\nwould also allow the center sufficient powers so as to ensure all\nbenefits of union—including powers to prevent frontier duties\nto facilitate commerce. He listed three necessary conditions for a\nfederation: sufficient mutual sympathy “of race, language, religion,\nand, above all, of political institutions, as conducing most to a\nfeeling of identity of political interest”; no member unit so powerful as\nto not require union for defense nor tempt unduly to secession; and\nrough equality of strength among member units to prevent internal\ndomination by one or two. Mill also claimed among the benefits of\nfederations that they reduce the number of weak states hence reduce\ntemptation to aggression, ending wars and restrictions on commence\namong member units; and that federations are less aggressive, only using\ntheir power defensively. Further benefits from federations—and from decentralized authority in general—might include learning from ‘experiments in living'.  \n\nPierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809–1865), in Du Principe\nfédératif (1863) defended federalism as the best way\nto retain individual liberty within ‘natural’ communities\nsuch as families and guilds who enter pacts among themselves for\nnecessary and specific purposes. The state is only one of several\nnon-sovereign agents in charge of coordinating, without final\nauthority. \nWhile Proudhon was wary of centralisation, authors such as Harold\nLaski warned of ‘The Obsolesence of Federalism’\n(1939). The important problems, such as those wrought by ‘giant\ncapitalism,’ require more centralised responses than federal\narrangements can muster.  \nPhilosophical reflections on federalism were invigorated during and\nafter the Second World War, for several reasons.  Altiero Spinelli and\nErnesto Rossi called for a European federal state in the Ventotene\nManifesto, published 1944. They condemned totalitarian,\ncentralised states and the never ending conflicts among them. Instead\nthere should be enough shared control over military and economic\npower, yet “each State will retain the autonomy it needs for a\nplastic articulation and development of political life according to\nthe particular characteristics of the various peoples.” Many\nexplain and justify the European Union along precisely these lines,\nwhile others are more critical. Hannah Arendt (1906–1975) traced both totalitarianism and\nindustrialized mass murder to flaws in the sovereign nation-state\nmodel. Skeptical both of liberal internationalism and political\nrealism, she instead urged a Republican federal model or ideal type\nwherein “the federated units mutually check and control their\npowers” (Arendt 1972).\n \nThe exit of colonial\npowers also left multi-ethnic states that required creative solutions to\ncombine self rule and shared rule (Karmis and Norman 2005). In\naddition, globalisation has prompted not only integration and\nharmonisation, but also—partly in response—explorations of ways to\nstill maintain some local self rule (Watts 1998). \nDevelopments of the European Union and backlash against its particular forms of political and legal integration is one major cause of renewed attention to the philosophy of federalism. Recent philosophical discussions have addressed\nseveral issues, including centrally the reasons for federalism, and\nattention to the sources of stability and instability; the legitimate\ndivision of power between member unit and center; distributive\njustice, challenges to received democratic theory, and concerns about\nthe politics of recognition. \n\nMany arguments for federalism have traditionally been put in terms\nof promoting various forms of liberty in the form of non-domination,\nimmunity or enhanced opportunity sets (Elazar 1987a). When considering\nreasons offered in the literature for federal political orders, many\nappear to be in favor of decentralization without requiring\nconstitutional entrenchment of split authority. Two sets of arguments\ncan be distinguished: Arguments favoring federal orders compared with\nsecession and completely independent sovereign states; and arguments\nsupporting federal arrangements rather than a (further) centralized\nunitary state. They occur in different forms and from different\nstarting points, in defense of ‘coming together’\nfederalism, and in favor of ‘holding together’\nfederalism. There are several suggested reasons for a federal order rather than\nseparate states or secession. Federations may foster peace, in the senses of preventing wars\nand preventing fears of war, in several ways. States can join a\n(con)federation to become jointly powerful enough to dissuade external\naggressors, and/or to prevent aggressive and preemptive wars among\nthemselves. The European federalists Altieri Spinelli, Ernesto Rossi\nand Eugenio Colorni argued the latter in the 1941 Ventotene Manifesto:\nOnly a European federation could prevent war between totalitarian,\naggressive states. Such arguments assume, of course, that the\n(con)federation will not become more aggressive than each state\nseparately, a point Mill argued. Federations can promote economic prosperity by removing\ninternal barriers to trade, through economies of scale, by establishing\nand maintaining inter-member unit trade agreements, or by becoming a\nsufficiently large global player to affect international trade regimes\n(for the latter regarding the EU, cf. Keohane and Nye 2001, 260). Federal arrangements may protect individuals against political\nauthorities by constraining state sovereignty, placing some powers with\nthe center. By entrusting the center with authority to intervene in\nmember units, the federal arrangements can protect minorities’ human\nrights against member unit authorities (Federalist, Watts 1999). Such\narguments assume, of course, that abuse by the center is less\nlikely. Federations can facilitate some objectives of sovereign states,\nsuch as credible commitments,certain kinds of coordination, and\ncontrol over externalities, by transferring some powers to a common\nbody. Since cooperation in some areas can ‘spill over’ and\ncreate demands for further coordination in other sectors, federations\noften exhibit creeping centralization. Federal arrangements may enhance the political\ninfluence of formerly sovereign governments, both by facilitating\ncoordination, and—particularly for small states—by giving\nthese member units influence or even veto over policy making, rather\nthan remaining mere policy takers. Federal political orders can be preferred as the appropriate form\nof nested organizations, for instance in ‘organic’\nconceptions of the political and social order. The federation may\npromote cooperation, justice or other values among and within member units\nas well as among and within their constituent units, for instance by\nmonitoring, legislating, enforcing or funding agreements, human rights,\nimmunity from interference, or development. Starting with the family,\neach larger unit responsible for facilitating the flourishing of\nmember units and securing common goods beyond their reach \nwithout a common authority. Such arguments have been offered by such\notherwise divergent authors as Althusius, the Catholic traditions of\nsubsidiarity as expressed by popes Leo XIII (1891) and Pius XI (1931),\nand Proudhon. There are several reasons for preferring federal orders over a\nunitary state: Federal arrangements may protect against central authorities by\nsecuring immunity and non-domination for minority groups or\nnations. Constitutional allocation of powers to a member unit protects\nindividuals from the center, while interlocking arrangements provide\ninfluence on central decisions via member unit bodies (Madison, Hume,\nGoodin 1996). Member units may thus check central authorities and\nprevent undue action contrary to the will of minorities: “A great\ndemocracy must either sacrifice self-government to unity or preserve\nit by federalism. The coexistence of several nations under the same\nState is a test, as well as the best security of its freedom … The\ncombination of different nations in one State is as necessary a\ncondition of civilized life as the combination of men in society”\n(Acton 1907, 277). More specifically, federal arrangements can accommodate\nminority nations who aspire to self determination and the preservation\nof their culture, language or religion. Such autonomy and immunity\narrangements are clearly preferable to the political conflicts that\nmight result from such groups' attempts at secession. Central\nauthorities may respond with human rights abuses, civil wars or ethnic\ncleansing to prevent such secessionist movements.  Federal orders may increase the opportunities for citizen\nparticipation in public decision-making; through deliberation and\noffices in both member unit and central bodies that ensures character\nformation through political participation among more citizens (Mill\n1861, ch. 15). Federal orders may facilitate learning by fostering alternative solutions to similar problems and sharing lessons from such a laboratory of ‘experiments in living' (Rose-Ackerman 1980). Federations may facilitate efficient preference maximization\nmore generally, as formalized in the literature on economic and fiscal\nfederalism—though many such arguments support decentralization\nrather than federalism proper. Research on ‘fiscal\nfederalism’ addresses the optimal allocation of authority,\ntypically recommending central redistribution but local provision of\npublic goods. Federal arrangements may allow more optimal matching of\nthe authority to create public goods to specific affected subsets of\nthe populations. If individuals' preferences vary systematically by\nterritory according to external or internal parameters such as\ngeography or shared tastes and values, federal—or\ndecentralized—arrangements that allow local variation may be\nwell suited for several reasons. Local decisions prevent overload of\ncentralised decision-making, and local decision-makers may also have a\nbetter grasp of affected preferences and alternatives, making for\nbetter service than would be provided by a central government that\ntends to ignore local preference variations (Smith 1776,\n680). Granting powers to population subsets that share preferences\nregarding public services may also increase efficiency by allowing\nthese subsets to create such ‘internalities’ and\n‘club goods’ at costs borne only by them (Musgrave 1959,\n179–80, Olson 1969, Oates’ 1972 ‘Decentralization\nTheorem’).  Federal arrangements can also shelter territorially based\ngroups with preferences that diverge from the majority population,\nsuch as ethnic or cultural minorities, so that they are not subject to\nmajority decisions severely or systematically contrary to their\npreferences. Non-unitary arrangements may thus minimize coercion and\nbe responsive to as many citizens as possible (Mill 1861 ch. 15,\nElazar 1968; Lijphart 1999). Such considerations of economic\nefficiency and majority decisions may favor federal solutions, with\n“only indivisibilities, economies of scale, externalities, and\nstrategic requirements … acceptable as efficiency arguments in\nfavor of allocating powers to higher levels of government”\n(Padou-Schioppa 1995, 155). Federal arrangements may not only protect existing clusters of\nindividuals with shared values or preferences, but may also promote\nmobility and hence territorial clustering of individuals with similar\npreferences. Member unit autonomy to experiment may foster competition\nfor individuals who are free to move where their preferences are best\nmet. Such mobility towards member units with like-minded individuals\nmay add to the benefits of local autonomy over the provision of public\nservices—absent economies of scale and externalities (Tiebout\n1956, Buchanan 2001)—though the result may be that those with\ncostly needs and who are less mobile are left worse off. \n\nMuch recent attention has focused on philosophical issues arising from\nempirical findings concerning federalism, and has been spurred by\nquite different dilemmas facing—inter alia—Canada,\nAustralia, Nepal, several European states and the European Union. \nFederal political orders require attention to several constitutional\nand other institutional issues, some of which raise peculiar and\nintriguing issues of normative political theory (Watts 1998; Norman\n2006). Composition: How to determine the boundaries of the member\nunits, e.g., along geographical, ethnic or cultural lines; whether\nestablishment of new member units from old should require\nconstitutional changes, whether to allow secession and if so how,\netc. Distribution of Power: The allocation of legislative,\nexecutive, judicial and constitution-amending power between\nthe member units and the central institutions. In asymmetric\narrangements some of these may differ among member units. Power Sharing: The form of influence by member units in central\ndecision-making bodies within the interlocking political\nsystems. These tasks must be resolved taking due account of several important\nconsiderations noted below. \nAs political orders go, federal political arrangements pose\npeculiar problems concerning stability and trust. Federations tend to drift\ntoward disintegration in the form of secession, or toward\ncentralization in the direction of a unitary state.  Such instability should come as no surprise given the tensions\ntypically giving rise to federal political orders in the first place,\nsuch as tensions between majority and minority national communities\nin multinational federations. Federal political orders are therefore\noften marked by a high level of ‘constitutional\npolitics’. The details of their constitutions and other\ninstitutions may affect these conflicts and their outcomes in drastic\nways. Political parties often disagree on constitutional issues\nregarding the appropriate areas of member unit autonomy, the forms of\ncooperation and how to prevent fragmentation. Such sampling bias among\nstates that federalize to hold together makes it difficult to assess\nclaims that federal responses perpetuate cleavages and fuel rather\nthan quell secessionist movements.  Some nevertheless argue that\ndemocratic, interlocking federations alleviate such tendencies (Simeon\n1998, Simeon and Conway 2001, Linz 1997; cf. McKay 2001, Filippov,\nOrdeshook and Shvetsova 2004). \n\nMany authors note that the challenges of stability must be addressed\nnot only by institutional design, but also by ensuring that citizens\nhave an ‘overarching loyalty’ to the federation as whole in\naddition to loyalty toward their own member unit (Franck 1968, Linz 1997).\nThe legitimate bases, content and division of such a public dual\nallegiance are central topics of political philosophies of federalism\n(Norman 1995a, Choudhry 2001). Some accept (limited) appeals to\nconsiderations such as shared history, practices, culture, or ethnicity\nfor delineating member units and placing certain powers with them, even if\nsuch ‘communitarian’ features are regarded as more\nproblematic bases for (unitary) political orders (Kymlicka 1995,\nHabermas 1996, 500). The appropriate consideration that voters and\ntheir member unit politicians should give to the interests of others in\nthe federation in interlocking arrangements must be clarified if the\nnotion of citizen of two commonwealths is to be coherent and\ndurable. \n\nAnother and related central philosophical topic is the critical\nassessment of alleged grounds for federal arrangements in general, and\nthe division of power between member units and central bodies in\nparticular, indicated in the preceding sections. Recent contributions\ninclude Knop et al. 1995, Kymlicka 2001, Kymlicka and Norman 2000,\nNicolaidis and Howse 2001, Norman 2006. Among the important issues,\nespecially due to the risks of instability, are: How the powers should be allocated, given that they should be\nused—but may be abused—by political entrepreneurs at\nseveral levels to affect their claims. The concerns about stability\nrequire careful attention to the impact of these powers on the ability\nto create and maintain ‘dual loyalties’ among the\ncitizenry. How to ensure that neither member units nor the central\nauthorities overstep their jurisdiction. As Mill noted, “the\npower to decide between them in any case of dispute should not reside\nin either of the governments, or in any functionary subject to it, but\nin an umpire independent of both.” (1861) Such a court must be\nsufficiently independent, yet not utterly unaccountable. Many scholars\nseem to detect a centralising tendency among such courts (Watts\n1998). How to maintain sufficient democratic control over central\nbodies when these are composed by representatives of the executive\nbranch of member units? The chains of accountability may be too long\nfor adequate responsiveness. This is part of the core concerns about a\n‘democratic deficit’ in the European Union (Watts 1998,\nFøllesdal and Hix 2006). Who shall have the authority to revise the constitutionally\nembedded division of power? Some hold that a significant shift in\nnational sovereignty occurs when such changes may occur without the\nunanimity characteristic of treaties. \n\nThe “Principle of Subsidiarity” has often been used to\nguide the decisions about allocation of power. This principle has\nrecently received attention owing to its inclusion in European Union\ntreaties. It holds that authority should rest with the member units\nunless allocating them to a central unit would ensure higher\ncomparative efficiency or effectiveness in achieving certain\ngoals. This principle can be specified in several ways, for instance\nconcerning which units are included, which goals are to be achieved,\nand who has the authority to apply it. The principle has multiple\npedigrees, and came to recent political prominence largely through its\nrole in quelling fears of centralization in Europe—a contested\nrole which the principle has not quite filled (Fleiner and Schmitt\n1996, Burgess and Gagnon 1993, Føllesdal 1998). \n\nRegarding distributive justice, federal political orders must manage\ntensions between ensuring member unit autonomy and securing the\nrequisite redistribution within and among the member units. Indeed,\nthe Federalists regarded federal arrangements as an important\nsafeguard against “the equal division of property”\n(Federalist 10). The political scientists Linz and Stepan may be seen\nas finding support for the Federalists’ hypothesis: Compared to\nunitary states in the OECD, the ‘coming together’\nfederations tend to have higher child poverty rate in solo mother\nhouseholds and a higher percentage of population over-sixty living in\npoverty. Linz and Stepan explain this inequality as stemming from the\n‘demos constraining’ arrangements of these federations,\nseeking to protect individuals and member units from central\nauthorities, combined with a weak party system. By comparison, the\nConstitution of Germany (not a ‘coming together’\nfederation) explicitly requires equalization of living conditions\namong the member units (Art. 72.2) Normative arguments may also\nsupport some distributive significance of federal arrangements, for\ninstance owing to trade-offs between member unit autonomy\nand redistributive claims among member units (Follesdal 2001), or the relevance of a shared ‘identity‘ (Grégoire and Jewkes 2015, de Schutter 2011). A\ncentral normative issue is to what extent a shared culture and bonds\namong citizens within a historically sovereign state reduce the claims\non redistribution among the member units. \n\nFederalism raises several challenges to democratic theory, especially\nas developed for unitary states. Federal arrangements are often more\ncomplex, thereby challenging standards of transparency, accountability and public deliberation (Habermas 2001). The restricted political agendas of each center of\nauthority also require defense (Dahl 1983; Braybrooke 1983). One of\nseveral particular issues concern the standing of member units (for\nfurther issues, cf., Norman 2006, 144–150). \n\nThe power that member units wield in federations often restricts or\nviolates majority rule, in ways that merit careful\nscrutiny. Democratic theory has long been concerned with how to\nprevent domination of minorities, and many federal political orders do\nso by granting member units some influence over common\ndecisions. Federal political orders typically influence\nindividuals' political influence by skewing their voting weight\nin favor of citizens of small member units, or by granting member unit\nrepresentatives veto rights on central decisions. Minorities thus\nexercise control in apparent violation of principles of political\nequality and one-person-one-vote—more so when member units are\nof different size. These features raises fundamental normative\nquestions concerning why member units should matter for the allocation\nof political power among individuals who live in different member\nunits. Many federal political orders accommodate minority groups in two\nways discussed above: both through a division of power, and by\ngranting them influence over common decisions. These measures\nof\n identity politics\n can be valuable ways to give public acknowledgment\nand recognition to groups and their members, sometimes on the very\nbasis of previous domination. But identity politics also create\nchallenges (Gutman 1994), especially in federal arrangements that face\ngreater risks of instability and must maintain citizens' dual\npolitical loyalties. Self-government arrangements may threaten the\nfederal political order: “demands for self-government reflect a\ndesire to weaken the bonds with the larger community and, indeed,\nquestion its very nature, authority and permanence” (Kymlicka\nand Norman 1994, 375). The emphasis on “recognition and\ninstitutionalization of difference could undermine the conditions that\nmake a sense of common identification and thus mutuality\npossible” (Carens 2000, 193). Federations are often thought to be sui generis,\none-of-a-kind deviations from the ideal-type unitary sovereign state\nfamiliar from the Westphalian world order. Indeed, every federation\nmay well be federal in its very own way, and not easy to summarize and\nassess as an ideal-type political order. Yet the phenomenon of\nnon-unitary sovereignty is not new, and federal accommodation of\ndifferences may well be better than the alternatives. When and why\nthis is so has long been the subject of philosophical, theoretical and\nnormative analysis and reflection. Such public arguments may\nthemselves contribute to develop the overarching loyalty required\namong citizens of stable, legitimate federations, who must understand\nthemselves as members of two commonwealths.","contact.mail":"andreas@follesdal.net","contact.domain":"follesdal.net"}]
