This\nlater Pyrrhonism was one of the two major traditions of sceptical\nthought in the Greco-Roman world (the other being located in Plato’s\nAcademy during much of the Hellenistic period). Perhaps the central\nquestion about Pyrrho is whether or to what extent he himself was a\nsceptic in the later Pyrrhonist mold. The later Pyrrhonists claimed\ninspiration from him; and, as we shall see, there is undeniably some\nbasis for this. But it does not follow that Pyrrho’s philosophy was\nidentical to that of this later movement, or even that the later\nPyrrhonists thought that it was identical; the claims of indebtedness\nthat are expressed by or attributed to members of the later Pyrrhonist\ntradition are broad and general in character (and in Sextus Empiricus’\ncase notably cautious—see Outlines of Pyrrhonism\n1.7), and do not in themselves point to any particular reconstruction\nof Pyrrho’s thought. It is necessary, therefore, to focus on the\nmeager evidence bearing explicitly upon Pyrrho’s own ideas and\nattitudes. How we read this evidence will also, of course, affect our\nconception of Pyrrho’s relations with his own philosophical contemporaries\nand predecessors.\n\n\n\nPyrrho appears to have lived from around 365–360 BCE until\naround 275–270 BCE (for the evidence see von Fritz (1963),\n90). We have several reports of philosophers from whom he learned, the\nmost significant (and the most reliable) of which concern his\nassociation with Anaxarchus of Abdera. Alongside Anaxarchus (and\nseveral other philosophers) he allegedly accompanied Alexander the\nGreat on his expedition to India. We are told that in the course of\nthis expedition he encountered some “naked wise men”\n(gumnosophistai); Diogenes Laertius (9.61) claims that his\nphilosophy developed as a result of this meeting, but it is not clear\nwhat basis, if any, he has for this assertion. In any case, after his\nreturn to Greece Pyrrho did espouse a philosophy that attracted\nnumerous followers, of whom the most important was Timon of\nPhlius. The travel writer Pausanias reports (6.24.5) seeing a statue\nof him in the marketplace in Pyrrho’s home town of Elis in the\nPeloponnese; Diogenes also reports (9.64) that he was made high\npriest, and that in his honor philosophers were made exempt from city\ntaxation. While Pausanias’ report is easier to accept at face\nvalue than Diogenes’, both suggest that (at least locally) he\nachieved considerable celebrity. However, there is no good reason to\nbelieve that a Pyrrhonist ‘movement’ continued beyond his\nown immediate followers; it was not until the first century BCE that\nPyrrhonism became the name of an ongoing philosophical tradition. \n\nWith the exception of poetry allegedly written while on Alexander’s expedition\n(which, as far as we can tell, did not survive that expedition),\nPyrrho wrote nothing; we are therefore obliged to try to reconstruct\nhis philosophy from reports by others. Unfortunately the reports that\nwe have are fragmentary and, in many cases, of doubtful reliability.\nPyrrho’s follower Timon wrote numerous poems and prose works; but of\nthese only fragments and in some cases second-hand reports survive. It\nis likely that much of what we hear about Pyrrho in later sources also\nderives indirectly from Timon, but it is frequently not possible to\njudge, in individual cases, whether or not this is so. Other\ndifficulties concerning Timon’s evidence are, first, that he writes as\na devotee rather than as a neutral reporter, and second, that the\ngreat majority of Timon’s fragments derive from a poem\ncalled Silloi (Lampoons), and consist of satirical\nthumbnail sketches of other philosophers rather than any kind of\ndirect exposition of Pyrrho’s outlook. Nevertheless, Timon is clearly\nthe most important and the most trustworthy source of information\nabout Pyrrho. Of the evidence from Timon, one piece is especially\nimportant. This is a summary, by the Peripatetic Aristocles of Messene\n(late 1st c. BCE), of an account by Timon of Pyrrho’s most general\nphilosophical attitudes; it is generally agreed that this passage must\nbe the centerpiece of any interpretation of Pyrrho’s philosophy. \n\nWith the exception of a very few snippets of information, the only\nother source of evidence on Pyrrho that is close to contemporary is\nAntigonus of Carystus, a biographer of the mid-third century BCE.\nDiogenes Laertius, whose life of Pyrrho is our major source of\nbiographical anecdotes, frequently cites Antigonus, and is probably\nindebted to him in many places even when he does not cite him;\nAntigonus is also mentioned by Aristocles, and is likely to be the\norigin of much or even most of the surviving biographical material on\nPyrrho. But Antigonus needs to be handled even more carefully than\nTimon. He was not a philosopher, and there is no reason to think that\nhe was capable of or particularly interested in comprehending\nphilosophical nuances. Nor is it clear that accuracy was high on his\nlist of priorities; on the contrary, what we know about him suggests\nthat he was a purveyor of sensationalist gossip rather than a reliable\nhistorian. His account probably did contain genuine information about\nPyrrho’s demeanor and activities; but it would certainly be unwise to\ntake his anecdotes as a group on trust. \n\nCicero refers to Pyrrho about ten times, and Cicero is, in general, a\nresponsible reporter of other people’s views. Unfortunately his\ninformation about Pyrrho appears to be very incomplete, and, as we\nshall see, the impression he conveys of him may very well be\ninaccurate. With one exception, he never mentions him except in\nconjunction with the famously non-orthodox Stoics Aristo and\n(sometimes) Herillus, and the remarks in question always concern the\nsame one or two points in ethics; it looks as if his knowledge of\nPyrrho derives almost entirely from a single source that conveyed\nlittle or nothing about Pyrrho individually, and nothing at all about\nany views of his in metaphysics or epistemology. In addition, a number\nof authors in later antiquity make isolated comments about Pyrrho. But\nsince these comments postdate the rise of the later Pyrrhonist\nmovement, there is often room for suspicion as to whether they reflect\ngenuine information about Pyrrho himself, as opposed to the later\nphilosophy that took his name. \n\nThe safest way to proceed, then, in attempting to interpret Pyrrho’s\nphilosophy, is to begin with a detailed analysis of the summary of\nTimon in Aristocles; the remaining evidence should be interpreted, and\nassessed for its trustworthiness, as far as possible in light of what\nthe Aristocles passage has to tell us about Pyrrho’s philosophy. This\nmethodology has been challenged by Green (2017), who proposes a more\nholistic approach in which other pieces of evidence may be used to\nshed light on the Aristocles passage itself. Pursuing that method\nwould be highly desirable, if it were possible. But it would require\nus to find other evidence that is both at least as historically\nreliable as, and clearer in purport than, the Aristocles passage; and\nit is highly doubtful whether any such evidence exists. \n\nWhatever one’s view on this last point, there is no doubt that the\ninterpretation of the Aristocles passage itself is fraught with\ncontroversy. Given the admitted centrality of this passage in any\ninterpretation of Pyrrho, it follows that the character of Pyrrho’s\nthinking is, at its very core, a matter for sharp disagreement. The\npresent survey will attempt to lay out the two main alternatives and\nexplore the consequences of each. (Numerous other readings besides\nthese two have been proposed; in particular, the interpretation of\nSvavarsson (2004) is an intriguing, though arguably unstable, hybrid\nof the two. But it is fair to say that these two are the ones that\nhave commanded by far the most scholarly attention.) \n\nA word, first, about the provenance and evidential value of the Aristocles\npassage. Several chapters from book 8 of Aristocles’ Peri\nphilosophias (On Philosophy) appear in quotation in the\nPraeparatio evangelica of Eusebius, the fourth-century bishop\nof Caesarea. These chapters expound, and then attack from an\nAristotelian perspective, a number of philosophies that impugn the\nreliability of one or other of our cognitive faculties. Among these\nAristocles counts Pyrrhonism, as represented by Pyrrho himself and by\nthe initiator of the later Pyrrhonist tradition, Aenesidemus;\nAristocles speaks of Aenesidemus (first century BCE, q.v.), as recent,\nand is apparently not aware of any subsequent members of the\nPyrrhonist tradition. The chapter on Pyrrhonism opens with a brief\nsummary of the outlook of Pyrrho specifically, as reported by Timon\n(14.18.1–5). \n\nThis convoluted transmission might lead one to doubt how much\nauthentic information can be extracted from the passage. But there is\nno reason, first, to doubt Eusebius’ explicit claim to be quoting\nAristocles verbatim. Aristocles is not quoting Timon verbatim; some of\nthe vocabulary in this passage is clearly reminiscent of Aristocles’\nown vocabulary in other chapters. However, other terms in the passage\nare quite distinct both from Aristocles’ own normal usage and from any\nof the terminology familiar to us from later Pyrrhonism, yet were in\nuse prior to Timon’s day; it seems easiest to account for these as\nauthentic reproductions of Timon’s own language. In addition, the\nfrequent mention of Timon either by name or by the word\nphêsi, ‘he says’, suggests that Aristocles\nis taking pains to reproduce the essentials of his account as\nfaithfully as possible. And finally, Aristocles’ other chapters, where\nwe are in a position to check his summaries against other evidence of\nthe views being summarized, suggest that he is in general a reliable\nreporter of other people’s views, even views to which he himself is\nstrongly opposed—or at least, that he is reliable when he has\naccess to systematic written expositions of those views, as seems to\nbe the case here. As for Timon’s reliability as a source for Pyrrho’s\nviews, a word was said about this in the previous section; this\npassage stands out from most of the surviving record from Timon in\nthat it appears to be based on a systematic account of the central\npoints of Pyrrho’s outlook. Thus, while we clearly cannot be sure that\nevery detail of the passage accurately reflects something that Pyrrho\nthought, all the indications are that the passage deserves to be taken\nseriously as evidence for Pyrrho’s philosophy. \n\nTimon is reported as telling us that in order to be happy, one must\npay attention to three connected questions: first, what are things\nlike by nature? second, how should we be disposed towards things\n(given our answer to the first question)? and third, what will be the\noutcome for those who adopt the disposition recommended in the answer\nto the second question? And the passage then gives us Pyrrho’s and\nTimon’s answers to each of the three questions in order. \n\nThe answer to the question “what are things like by\nnature?” is given by a sequence of three epithets; things are\nsaid to be adiaphora and astathmêta and\nanepikrita. Taken by themselves, these epithets can be\nunderstood in two importantly different ways: they may be taken as\ncharacterizing how things are (by nature) in themselves, or they may\nbe taken as commenting on human beings’ lack (by our nature) of\ncognitive access to things. Adiaphora is normally translated\n‘indifferent’. But this might be taken as referring either\nto an intrinsic characteristic of things—namely that, in\nthemselves and by nature, they possess no differentiating features\n— or to our natural inability to discern any such features. In\nthe latter case ‘undifferentiable’ might be a more\nperspicuous translation. (Beckwith (2011) plausibly connects the focus\non differentiating features, or the lack of them, with the\nAristotelian notion of differentiae; on either of the readings to be\nexplored, Aristotle’s picture of the world and of our ability to\nunderstand it would indeed be a prime example of the kind of view from\nwhich Pyrrho is anxious to distance himself.)\nSimilarly, astathmêta might mean ‘unstable’\nor ‘unbalanced’, describing an objective property of\nthings; or it might mean ‘not subject to being placed on a\nbalance’, and hence ‘unmeasurable’, which would\nagain place the focus on our cognitive\ninabilities. And anepikrita might mean\n‘indeterminate’, referring to an objective lack of any\ndefinite features, or ‘indeterminable’, pointing to an\ninability on our part to determine the features of things. The\nstatement as a whole, then, is either answering the question\n“what are things like by nature?” by stating that things\nare, in their very nature, indefinite or indeterminate in various ways\n— the precise nature of the thesis would be a matter for further\nspeculation—or by stating that we human beings are not in a\nposition to pin down or determine the nature of things. Let us call\nthese the metaphysical and the epistemological interpretations\nrespectively. \n\nIt is clear that the metaphysical interpretation gives us a Pyrrho who\nis not in any recognizable sense a sceptic. Pyrrho, on this\ninterpretation, is issuing a declaration about the nature of things in\nthemselves—precisely what the later Pyrrhonists who called\nthemselves sceptics were careful to avoid. On the epistemological\ninterpretation, on the other hand, Pyrrho is very much closer to the\ntradition that took his name. There is still some distance between\nthem. To say that we cannot determine the nature of things\n— as opposed to saying that we have so far failed to determine\nthe natural features of things—is already a departure from the\nsceptical suspension of judgement promoted by Sextus Empiricus. And to\nput it, as on this reading Pyrrho does put it, by saying that\nthings are indeterminable, is a further departure, in that it\ndoes attribute at least one feature to things in themselves —\nnamely, being such that humans cannot determine them. Nevertheless,\nthe epistemological interpretation clearly portrays Pyrrho as a\nforerunner—a naive and unsophisticated forerunner, perhaps\n— of later Pyrrhonist scepticism, whereas the metaphysical\ninterpretation puts him in a substantially different light. \n\nThe natural way to try to choose between these two interpretations is\nto see which of them fits best with the logic of the passage as a\nwhole. But here we encounter a further complication. The text of the\nphrase that follows the words we have just been discussing is subject\nto dispute. According to the manuscripts this phrase reads\n“for this reason (dia touto) neither our\nsensations nor our opinions tell the truth or lie”. Now, if this\nreading is correct, the thought expressed seems to favor the\nmetaphysical interpretation; the idea is that, since things are in\ntheir real nature indeterminate, our sensations and opinions, which\nrepresent things as having certain determinate features, are neither\ntrue nor false. They are not true, since reality is not the way they\npresent it as being; but they are not false either, since that too\nwould require that reality have certain determinate features, namely\nfeatures that are the negations of the ones that our sensations and\nopinions portray it as having. By contrast, it is quite unclear how\nthe claim that the nature of things cannot be determined by us could\nbe thought to license the inference “for this reason neither our\nsensations nor our opinions tell the truth or lie”. That claim\nwould seem at most to license the very different inference that\nwe cannot tell whether they tell the truth or lie. \n\nBut some scholars have suggested that the manuscripts are in error at\nthis point, and that what the text should say is “on account\nof the fact that (dia to) neither our sensations nor our\nopinions tell the truth or lie”. The change is justified on\nlinguistic grounds; it is alleged that the text in the manuscripts as\nthey stand is not acceptable Greek. The considerations for and against\nthis proposal are technical, and debate has yielded no consensus on\nthis question. However, it is clear that if one does make this small\nalteration to the text, the direction of the inference is reversed;\nthe point about our sensations and opinions now becomes a reason for\nthe point about the nature of things, not an inference from it. And\nthis, it has been argued, points towards the epistemological\ninterpretation. The idea would then be that, since our sensations and\nopinions fail to be consistent deliverers of true reports (or, for\nthat matter, false reports) about the world around us, there is no\nprospect of our being able to determine the nature of things. \n\nThis is the crux on which the decision between the two main lines of\ninterpretation of Pyrrho’s philosophy turns. The remainder of the\nAristocles passage, and indeed the remainder of the evidence on Pyrrho\nin general, can be read so as to fit with either the metaphysical or\nthe epistemological reading of his answer to the question about the\nnature of things. The Aristocles passage continues with the answer to\nthe second question, namely the question of the attitude we should\nadopt given the answer to the first question. We are told, first, that\nwe should not trust our sensations and opinions, but should adopt an\nunopinionated attitude. On the epistemological reading, the\nsignificance of this is obvious. But on the metaphysical reading, too,\nwe have already been told that our sensations and opinions are not\ntrue, which is presumably reason enough for us not to trust them; and\nthe unopinionated attitude that is here recommended may be understood\nas one in which one refrains from positing any definite\ncharacteristics as inherent in the nature of things—given that\ntheir real nature is wholly indefinite. (To the objection that this\nthesis of indefiniteness is itself an opinion, it may be replied that\ndoxa, ‘opinion’, is regularly used in earlier\nGreek philosophy, especially in Parmenides and Plato, to refer to\nthose opinions—misguided opinions, in the view of these\nauthors—that take on trust a view of the world as conforming\nmore or less to the way it appears in ordinary experience. In this\nusage, the claim that reality is indefinite would not be a (mere)\nopinion, but would be a statement of the truth.) \n\nThe passage now introduces a certain form of speech that is supposed\nto reflect this unopinionated attitude. We are supposed to say\n“about each single thing that it no more is than is not or both\nis and is not or neither is nor is not”. There are a number of\nintricate questions about the exact relations between the various\nparts of this complicated utterance, and especially about the role and\nsignificance of the ‘both’ and ‘neither’\ncomponents. But it is clear that this too is susceptible of being read\nalong the lines of either of the two interpretations introduced above.\nOn the metaphysical interpretation, we are being asked to adopt a form\nof words that reflects the utter indefiniteness of the way things are;\nwe should not say of anything that it is any particular way\nany more than that it is not that way (with ‘is’\nbeing understood, as commonly in Greek philosophy, as shorthand for\n‘is F’, where F stands for any arbitrary\npredicate). On the epistemological interpretation, we are being asked\nto use a manner of speaking that expresses our suspension of judgement\nabout how things are. Sextus Empiricus specifically tells us that\n‘no more’ (ou mallon) is a term used by the\nsceptics to express suspension of judgement, and its occurrence in the\nAristocles passage can be taken as an early example of the same type\nof usage. \n\nFinally, in answer to the third question, we are told that the result\nfor those who adopt the unopinionated attitude just recommended is\nfirst aphasia and then ataraxia.  Ataraxia,\n‘freedom from worry’, is familiar to us from later\nPyrrhonism; this is said by the later Pyrrhonists to be the result of\nthe suspension of judgement that they claimed to be able to\ninduce. The precise sense of aphasia is less clear. Beckwith\n(2011) actually argues that the transmitted text is erroneous, and\nthat we should instead read apatheia, “lack of passion”. This\nis an attractive suggestion; apatheia is indeed a term used\nnot infrequently of Pyrrho’s untroubled attitude (see section 5),\nwhereas a reference to aphasia would be unparalleled in the\nother evidence on Pyrrho. However, the proposal is inevitably\nspeculative, and aphasia is a term in use in later\nPyrrhonism; it seems worth trying to elucidate it on the assumption\nthat the transmitted text is correct. It might mean\n‘non-assertion’, as in Sextus—that is, a refusal to\ncommit oneself to definite alternatives; or it might mean, more\nliterally, ‘speechlessness’, which could in turn be taken\nto be an initial reaction of stunned silence to the radical position\nwith which one has been presented (an uncomfortable reaction that is\nsubsequently replaced by ataraxia—the passage does say\nthat aphasia comes first and ataraxia comes\nlater). But the decision between these two ways of understanding the\nterm is independent of the broader interpretive issues bearing upon\nthe passage as a whole. For some form of ‘non-assertion’\nis clearly licensed by either the metaphysical or the epistemological\ninterpretation; and on either interpretation, the view proposed might\nindeed render someone (initially) uncomfortable to the point of\n‘speechlessness’. The important point, though, is that\nataraxia is the end result; and this links back to the\nintroductory remark to the effect that the train of thought to be\nsummarized has the effect of making one happy. \n\nWe have, then, two major possibilities. On the one hand, Pyrrho can be\nread as advancing a sweeping metaphysical thesis, that things are in\ntheir real nature indefinite or indeterminate, and encouraging us to\nembrace the consequences of that thesis by refusing to attribute any\ndefinite features to things (at least, as belonging to their real\nnature) and by refusing to accept at face value (again, as revelatory\nof the real nature of things) those myriad aspects of our ordinary\nexperience that represent things as having certain definite features.\nOr, on the other hand, Pyrrho can be read as declaring that the nature\nof things is inaccessible to us, and encouraging us to withdraw our\ntrust (and to speak in such a way as to express our withdrawal of\ntrust) in ordinary experience as a guide to the nature of things. As\nnoted earlier, the second, epistemological interpretation makes\nPyrrho’s outlook a great deal closer to that of the later Pyrrhonists\nwho took him as an inspiration. But that is not in itself any reason\nfor favoring this interpretation over the other, metaphysical one. For\non either interpretation Pyrrho is said to promise ataraxia,\nthe later Pyrrhonists’ goal, and to promise it as a result of\na certain kind of withdrawal of trust in the veracity of our everyday\nimpressions of things; the connection between these two points aligns\nPyrrho with the later Pyrrhonists, and sets him apart from every other\nGreek philosophical movement that preceded later Pyrrhonism. The fact\nthat this later sceptical tradition took Pyrrho as an inspiration is\ntherefore readily understandable whichever of the two interpretations\nis correct (or whichever they thought was correct). It is also true\nthat, on the metaphysical interpretation of the passage, the grounds\non which Pyrrho advanced his metaphysical thesis of indeterminacy are\nnever specified; this too, like the precise character of the thesis\nitself, must be a matter for speculative reconstruction. But\nAristocles only purports to be giving the key points of Timon’s\nsummary; the lack of detail, though disappointing, would not be\nsurprising. \n\nThe other evidence bearing upon Pyrrho’s central philosophical\nattitudes does nothing to settle the dispute between these two\npossible interpretations of the Aristocles passage. A number of texts\nexplicitly or implicitly represent Pyrrho’s outlook as essentially\nidentical to the sceptical outlook of the later Pyrrhonists. However,\nall of these texts postdate the rise of later Pyrrhonism itself, and\nnone of them contains anything like the level of detail of the\nAristocles passage; there is no particular reason to suppose that any\nof them represents a genuine understanding of Pyrrho as distinct from\nthe later Pyrrhonists.  There are also a few texts that appear to\noffer a picture of Pyrrho’s thought that is congenial to the\nmetaphysical interpretation. The most significant of these is a\npassage from near the beginning of Diogenes Laertius’ life of Pyrrho\n(9.61); Pyrrho, we are told, “said that nothing is either fine\nor ignoble or just or unjust; and similarly in all cases that nothing\nis the case in reality (mêden einai têi\nalêtheiai), but that human beings do everything by\nconvention and habit; for each thing is no more this than that”.\nThis looks as if it is attributing to Pyrrho a metaphysical thesis,\nand a thesis according to which things have no definite features; it\ndoes not seem to be portraying Pyrrho as an advocate of suspension of\njudgement. However, the passage is undoubtedly in some way confused.\nFor immediately beforehand we are told that Pyrrho was the one who\ninitiated the type of philosophy consisting of\n“inapprehensibility and suspension of judgement”; and the\npreviously quoted passage is then cited as confirmation of this. This\npassage of Diogenes as a whole, then, fails to maintain any clear\ndistinction between epistemological and metaphysical readings of\nPyrrho’s thought, and cannot safely be used as evidence for\neither. \n\nMost of the remaining evidence about Pyrrho has to do with his\npractical attitudes and behavior. There are a number of biographical\nanecdotes, and there are a few fragments of Timon that purport to\ndepict Pyrrho’s state of mind. Some of the biographical anecdotes are\nclearly polemical inventions. For example, Diogenes (9.62) reports\nAntigonus as saying that Pyrrho’s lack of trust in his senses led him\nto ignore precipices, oncoming wagons and dangerous dogs, and that his\nfriends had to follow him around to protect him from these various\neveryday hazards. But he then reports the dissenting verdict of\nAenesidemus, according to which Pyrrho was perfectly capable of\nconducting himself in a sensible manner. This reflects a longstanding\nancient dispute as to whether it is possible to live if one radically\nabandons common-sense attitudes to the world (as, on either of the two\nmajor interpretations outlined above, Pyrrho in some sense did).\nAntigonus has transformed a hostile criticism of Pyrrho—that,\nif one really were to adopt the attitudes he recommends, one\nwould be unable consistently to live as a sane human being\n— into an account of how Pyrrho actually did act; but there is\nno reason to take this seriously as biography. (It does, however,\nraise the question of what it means to mistrust the senses—as\nthe Aristocles passage tells us, on either interpretation, that Pyrrho\ndid—if this is to be consistent with self-preservation in\none’s ordinary behavior; we shall return to this point at the end of\nthis section.) \n\nBut there are many other anecdotes, preserved in Diogenes and\nelsewhere, that cannot be dismissed in this fashion. The dominant\nimpression that they convey as a group is of an extraordinary\nimpassivity or imperturbability; with rare exceptions (which he\nhimself is portrayed as regretting), Pyrrho is depicted as maintaining\nhis calm and untroubled attitude no matter what happens to him. This\nextends even to extreme physical pain—he is reported not to\nhave flinched when subjected to the horrific techniques of ancient\nsurgery—but it also encompasses dangers such as being on a\nship in a storm. (This is not to say that he did not avoid such\ntroubles if he could, as suggested by the apocryphal stories mentioned\nin the previous paragraph; it is just to say that he did not lose his\ncomposure in the face of life’s inevitable hardships.) There is\nanother aspect to this untroubled attitude as well. In numerous\nanecdotes Pyrrho is shown as unconcerned with adhering to the normal\nconventions of society; he wanders off for days on end by himself, and\nhe performs tasks that would normally be left to social inferiors,\nsuch as housework and even washing a pig. Here, too, the suggestion is\nthat he does not care about things that ordinary people do care about\n— in this case, the disapproval of others. (The passage from\nDiogenes quoted in the previous section, according to which Pyrrho\nheld “that human beings do everything by convention and\nhabit” is not necessarily in conflict with this; by ‘human\nbeings’ Pyrrho might have meant ordinary human beings,\namong whom he would not have included himself.) \n\nThe fragments of Timon also emphasize Pyrrho’s exceptional\ntranquillity, and add a further, more philosophical dimension to it.\nSeveral fragments suggest that this tranquillity results from his not\nengaging in theoretical inquiry like other philosophers, and with his\nnot engaging in debate with those philosophers. Other thinkers are\nperturbed by their need to discover how the universe works, and their need to\nprevail in arguments with their rivals; Pyrrho is unconcerned about\nany of this. \n\nClearly it would be foolish to accept every detail of this composite\naccount. Timon’s picture is no doubt idealized, and the biographical\nmaterial surely includes a measure of embellishment. Collectively,\nhowever, these fragments and anecdotes add up to a highly consistent\nportrait; it does not seem overconfident to take this at least as\nreflecting an ideal towards which Pyrrho strived, and which he\nachieved to a sufficient degree to have attracted notice. \n\nWhat connections can be drawn between this portrait of Pyrrho’s\ndemeanor and the philosophy expounded in the Aristocles passage? What\nwe have here, plainly, is a fuller specification of the\nataraxia that the Aristocles passage promised as the outcome\nof the process of responding in the recommended way to the three\nquestions. But why should this process be thought to yield\nataraxia, and why should the outcome take the specific form\nsuggested by the material discussed in this section? Now is a\nconvenient point to address these questions (as we did not do in\ninitially examining the Aristocles passage). We may distinguish the\noverall emotional tranquillity depicted in the biographical material\nand the particular tranquillity, derived from the avoidance of\ntheoretical inquiry, that is emphasized in the fragments of Timon. \n\nThe most obvious explanation for the overall emotional tranquillity\nwould seem to be along the following lines. If one adopts the position\nrecommended in the answers to the Aristocles passage’s first two\nquestions, one will not hold any definite beliefs, about any object or\nstate of affairs, to the effect that the object or state of affairs\nreally is good, or valuable, or worth seeking—or, on the other\nhand, bad or to be avoided. (This will be true on either the\nmetaphysical or the epistemological interpretations of the Aristocles\npassage.) Hence one will attach far less importance to the attainment\nor the avoidance of any particular objects, or the occurrence or\nnon-occurrence of any particular state of affairs, than one would if\none thought that these things really did have some kind of positive or\nnegative value; nothing will matter to one to anything like the same\nextent as it matters to most people. If this is on the right lines,\nthen Pyrrho’s route to ataraxia closely resembles the one\ndescribed in several places by Sextus Empiricus (PH 1.25–30,\n3.235–8, M 11.110–67); the account I have given is in fact\nmodeled after Sextus’ explanation of how suspension of judgement\nproduces ataraxia.  Indeed, it is difficult to see how else\nthe process is to be reconstructed. One difference, however, between\nthe practical attitudes of Pyrrho and Sextus is that Sextus attributes\nan important role to convention in the shaping of one’s behavior; more\non this in a moment. \n\nAs for the avoidance of theoretical inquiry and debate, it is fair to\nassume that Pyrrho will have regarded such inquiry and debate as\ntroublesome because it is necessarily fruitless and interminable. If\nthe real nature of things is indeterminable by us, as the\nepistemological interpretation would have it, then to attempt to\ndetermine the nature of things, and to provide cogent grounds for the\nsuperiority of one’s own theories, is to attempt the impossible; such\nmatters are simply beyond our grasp. But if, as the metaphysical\ninterpretation would have it, the world is in its real nature\nindefinite, then one is also attempting the impossible, though for a\ndifferent reason; one is attempting to determine a fixed character for\nthings that inherently lack any fixed character. Of course, the thesis\nthat reality is indefinite is itself a definite statement. But it\nfollows from this statement that any attempt to establish fixed and\ndefinite characteristics for specific items in the universe is doomed\nto failure. And it seems to be this kind of theoretical inquiry that\nTimon represents Pyrrho as eschewing; as one fragment puts it\n(addressing Pyrrho), “you were not concerned to inquire what\nwinds hold sway over Greece, from where everything comes and into what\nit passes” (Diogenes Laertius 9.65). On this reading, then,\nPyrrho’s avoidance of inquiry and debate resembles the disdain for\nphysical speculation that is apparent in some writings of Plato (the\nPhaedo for example); physical speculation is fruitless\nbecause the physical world is not susceptible to rational inquiry. \n\nHere another difference may be discerned from the Pyrrhonism of Sextus\nEmpiricus. For although Sextus certainly does not claim to have\ndefinite answers of his own concerning the nature of things, he has no\nqualms about engaging with his opponents in debate, or about pitting\nthem against one another. Indeed, the Pyrrhonism of Sextus depends on\na constant interplay of competing arguments on as many topics as\npossible. One’s suspension of judgement results from one’s experience\nof the ‘equal strength’ (isostheneia) of the\ncompeting considerations on all sides of a given issue; but this\nrequires that one be regularly exposed to such competing\nconsiderations, and the works of Sextus are themselves bountiful\nsources for this. Sextus may agree with Pyrrho that such debates are\ninterminable, but they have an important role in later Pyrrhonist\npractice nonetheless. Pyrrho’s own practice is quite different,\nbecause his ataraxia flows not from an ongoing practice of\nintellectual juggling, but from a conclusion about the nature\nof things, as reported in the Aristocles passage—either that\nit is indeterminable by us or that it is indefinite—that he\nhas arrived at once and for all. \n\nWe have seen that Pyrrho was unconcerned, or aspired to be\nunconcerned, about things that most of us care about very deeply. But\nhow does one make any decisions at all, if one adopts this kind of\nattitude? Unless we are to believe the stories of Pyrrho as a madman\ndepending on his friends to rescue him from precipices and dogs, we\nare entitled to expect an answer to this question. There is some\nevidence to suggest that the answer proposed—if not by Pyrrho\nhimself, then at least by Timon—was that one relies on the\nappearances. If this is correct, we have another link, at least at a\ngeneral level, with the Pyrrhonism of Sextus, for whom appearances are\nwhat he calls the “criterion of action”. One difference,\nas mentioned earlier, is that Sextus lists laws and customs as one of\nthe four main varieties of appearances that one may use to guide one’s\nbehavior; on Sextus’ account, then, certain courses of action will\nappear to one as desirable or undesirable given that they are approved\nor disapproved of by the prevailing mores. But Pyrrho seems to have\nbeen thoroughly unconventional in some aspects of his behavior. It is\nimpossible to say specifically what kinds of phenomena were included\nfor him and Timon under the heading of ‘the appearances’\n— or whether they had anything very precise in mind\nhere. Nevertheless, it looks as if the early or proto-Pyrrhonist\nanswer to the question of how one acts and makes decisions is that one\ndoes so in light of the way things appear to one. On the\nepistemological interpretation, this will amount to “in light of\nthe characteristics that things seem to have (but, for all we know,\nmay not really have)”; on the metaphysical interpretation, it\nwill amount to “in light of the temporary and contingent\ncharacteristics that things manifest on any given occasion (but that\nare no part of how they really are, since how they really are\nis indefinite)”. In either case, the way in which one mistrusts\nsensations and common-sense opinions, as the Aristocles passage\nrecommends, is not that one pays no attention to them in one’s\neveryday behavior; one mistrusts them simply in that one does not take\nthem as a guide to the underlying nature of things. \n\nThere is one further, highly problematic fragment of Timon that seems\nto belong in the area of practical philosophy. This is a set of four\nlines of verse that make reference to “the nature of the divine\nand the good”. There is no consensus on how to translate these\nlines, and different translations yield very different consequences\nfor interpretation. The first two lines can be rendered either \n\nThe second two lines can be rendered either \n\nThere are numerous other disputes over the translation, but these\nalternatives put on display most of the central options for\ninterpretation. \n\nThe lines are quoted by Sextus Empiricus (M 11.20); there is\nno further trace of them in the surviving record. The context in which\nSextus introduces them shows that he is inclined to understand the\nfirst couplet according to reading (A) rather than reading( B); but he\nsuggests that he is not sure about this. The speaker into whose mouth\nTimon put these lines is never identified, but it has generally been\nassumed to be Pyrrho. \n\nIf one understands the second couplet according to reading (C), then\nthe speaker is apparently endorsing a position that attributes\ndefinite natures to things; and this appears flatly inconsistent with\nthe Aristocles passage, on either the metaphysical or the\nepistemological reading. The tension is especially bad if one reads\nthe first couplet according to reading (B), in which case the speaker\nis insisting that he is in possession of the truth. But even on\nreading (A), where the effect is to weaken the assertion to one about\nwhat appears to the speaker to be the case, the statement about\n“the nature of the divine and the good” seems strikingly\nout of keeping with the rest of what we hear about Pyrrho’s\nphilosophy. It has been suggested that Pyrrho made an exception, in\nthe case of the divine and the good, to his general prohibition on\nattributing definite natures to things; but it is hard to see the\nmotivation for such a move, and this interpretation has not been\ngenerally accepted. It is true that Cicero speaks of Pyrrho as holding\nthat virtue is the sole good, and that no distinctions of value are to\nbe drawn among things other than virtue and vice. However, as was\nmentioned earlier, Cicero always attributes this view to Pyrrho\nalongside the unorthodox Stoic Aristo of Chios; he never gives any\ndetails about Pyrrho’s thinking specifically. We know from other\nsources that Aristo did hold this position; and, as we have seen,\nthere is good reason to think that Pyrrho did refrain quite generally\nfrom attributing positive or negative value to ordinary objects of\nconcern (things other than virtue and vice), which is one part of the\nposition Cicero attributes to him and Aristo. So it looks as if Cicero\nhas been misled (probably by the sketchiness of the information in his\nsource) into thinking that Pyrrho agreed with Aristo in both parts of\nhis position rather than in just one part. At any rate, Cicero cannot\nbe regarded as offering any credible support for an interpretation of\nPyrrho that has him believing in a natural good; again, this is just\ntoo discordant with the remainder of the evidence. \n\nReading (D) of Timon’s second couplet (which is due, with minor\nmodifications, to Burnyeat (1980)) is intended to eliminate the\ntroublesome reference to an eternal real nature. According to this\ninterpretation, the phrase “the nature of the divine and the\ngood” refers simply to a characteristic that is attributed to\nPyrrho, and labeled by poetic hyperbole as ‘divine’, in\nanother fragment of Timon, namely his extraordinary tranquillity; the\ncouplet as a whole, then, is saying that tranquillity is the source of\nan even-tempered life. And if one combines this with the less dogmatic\nreading (A) of the first couplet, this yields a set of remarks that\nare not obviously in conflict with anything else in the record on\nPyrrho. \n\nThe acceptability of the translation in reading (D) is not beyond\nquestion. There is also some question whether the claim that\ntranquillity is the source of an even-tempered life is anything more\nthan vacuous. However, if one assumes that Pyrrho is the speaker of\nthese lines, then this interpretation or something close to it seems\nto be the only way to rescue his thought (as reported by Timon) from\ninconsistency. Another possibility, an interpretatively less\nburdensome one, is to drop the assumption that Pyrrho is the speaker;\nin this case, there is no reason to assume that the thought expressed\nby the lines must be consistent with what we know of Pyrrho’s\nphilosophy. But if one takes this option, one must devise an\nalternative explanation for why Timon would have written these\nlines—including some account of who else the speaker might\nbe. This challenge has recently been taken up in Clayman (2010),\nchapter 2. Clayman argues that the speaker is Timon himself, and that\nthe lines serve a programmatic function at the opening of the poem; in\nlight of parallel passages in other early Hellenistic poetry, the\nreference to truth is understood as an allusion to poetic\nverisimilitude rather than to anything philosophically problematic.\nFinally, it has been suggested (in Svavarsson 2002)\nthat muthon, rendered in both readings (A) and (B) by\n“word”, should rather be understood as “myth”\nin the sense of “fiction” (and “of truth”\nlinked instead, as is linguistically quite possible, with\n“standard”). In this case, again, there is no difficulty\nin understanding the second couplet as expressing a dogmatic position;\nindeed, such a reading is only to be expected, since the position is\nbeing debunked, not advocated. Green (2017) has extended\nSvavarsson’s suggestion by proposing that “word of\ntruth” and “correct standard” are to be understood\nsarcastically rather than at face value, making fun of other\nthinkers’ belief in these things (which would also render the\nthought less dogmatic; it would not simply be a declaration of\nfalsehood). But whether the word muthos, all by itself, can\ncarry this weight of significance—or whether, if that is what\nTimon had intended, he would not have chosen some less ambiguous means\nof expressing it—is open to question. It is fair to say that no\nresolution of these matters is in sight; the fragment continues to be\nregarded as one of the most intractable pieces of evidence in the\ncorpus of material on Pyrrho and Timon. \n\nMany different philosophical antecedents have been claimed for\nPyrrho. Since we know very little about which philosophical currents\nPyrrho may have been acquainted with, such claims are bound to be in\nlarge measure speculative. There are, however, a couple of exceptions\nto this; as noted at the outset, Pyrrho was associated with Anaxarchus\nand was reported to have encountered some unnamed Indian thinkers. The\nlittle that we know of Anaxarchus seems to suggest that his philosophy\nhad a good deal in common with Pyrrho’s. Diogenes Laertius (9.60)\nascribes to him an attitude of apatheia and eukolia,\n‘freedom from emotion’ and ‘contentedness’; as\nnoted earlier,\napatheia is used in some sources to describe Pyrrho’s\nattitude as well, and the combination of the two terms seems to\ndescribe something close to the state cultivated by Pyrrho. We also\nhear from Sextus Empiricus that Anaxarchus “likened existing\nthings to stage-painting and took them to be similar to the things\nwhich strike us while asleep or insane” (M 7.88). This\nhas often been taken as an early expression of a form of\nepistemological scepticism.  But it may also be taken as an\nontological comment on the insubstantiality of the world around us; it\nis things (as opposed to our impressions of things) that are\nassimilated to stage-sets and the contents of dreams and\nfantasies. Either way, the remark looks like an anticipation of\nPyrrho’s position in the Aristocles passage; the first reading\nconforms to the epistemological interpretation of that passage, and\nthe second to the metaphysical interpretation. It appears, then, that\nPyrrho may have borrowed to a considerable extent from\nAnaxarchus. There is, however, no indication that Anaxarchus drew a\nconnection between his view of the nature of things and his attitude\nof emotional contentment, such as we have seen that Pyrrho did. \n\nWe do not know the identity of the “naked wise men” whom\nPyrrho met in India, or what they thought. There are reports of other\nmeetings between Indian and Greek thinkers during Alexander’s\nexpedition, and these tend to emphasize the Indians’ extraordinary\nimpassivity and insensitivity to pain and hardship. It is not unlikely\nthat Pyrrho, too, was impressed by traits of this kind. Though\nprecedents for his ideal of ataraxia exist in earlier Greek\nphilosophy as well, his reported ability to withstand surgery without\nflinching is exceptional in the Greek context (and quite distinct from\nanything in later Pyrrhonism); if we believe this story, it is\ntempting to explain it by way of some form of training from the\nIndians. Some scholars have sought to establish more detailed links\nbetween the thought of the Aristocles passage and various currents in\nancient Indian philosophy; and Beckwith (2015) finds in Pyrrho an\nauthentic representative of early Buddhism. But there is at least room\nfor debate about how far these similarities really go. From an\nopposing perspective, some have suggested that the linguistic barriers\nwould have ruled out an interchange of any great philosophical\nsubtlety between the Indians and Pyrrho. But this may be overly\npessimistic; the expedition lasted a number of years, and some people\nmanage to learn new languages remarkably quickly. \n\nBeyond these figures with attested connections to Pyrrho, it is\nplausible to suppose a certain influence on Pyrrho from Democritus.\nPyrrho is reported to have had a special admiration for Democritus\n(Diogenes Laertius 9.67, citing Pyrrho’s associate Philo); Democritus\nis one of the few philosophers besides Pyrrho himself who seems to\nescape serious criticism in Timon’s Lampoons; and Anaxarchus\nbelonged in the tradition of thinkers stemming from Democritus. The\ninfluence may have been mainly in the ethical area; Democritus, too,\nhad an ethical ideal that is recognizably a forerunner to Pyrrho’s\nataraxia. If one adopts the epistemological interpretation of\nPyrrho’s philosophy, one may see an additional area of influence in\nDemocritus’ sceptical pronouncements about the prospects for knowledge\nof the world around us. \n\nAlternatively, if one interprets Pyrrho along metaphysical lines, one\nmay be inclined to look to Plato and the Eleatics as possible\ninfluences. Timon’s verdicts on these figures in the Lampoons\nare at least partially favorable; and, as was hinted at earlier on,\nthe dim view of sensibles that is suggested by a number of Plato’s\ndialogues—but also anticipated by the Eleatics—seems\nto have something in common with Pyrrho’s view of reality (on the\nmetaphysical interpretation) as indeterminate. The difference, of\ncourse, is that Pyrrho does not suggest any higher level of reality\nsuch as Plato’s Forms or the Eleatic Being. \n\nPyrrho’s relation to the later Pyrrhonists has already been\ndiscussed. Given the importance of Pyrrhonism in earlier modern\nphilosophy, Pyrrho’s indirect influence may be thought of as very\nconsiderable. But beyond his being adopted as a figurehead in later\nPyrrhonism—itself never a widespread philosophical movement\n— Pyrrho seems to have had very little impact in the ancient\nworld after his own lifetime. Both Cicero and Seneca refer to Pyrrho\nas a neglected figure without a following, and the surviving\ntestimonia do not contradict this impression. It is possible that he\nhad some influence on the form of scepticism adopted by Arcesilaus and\nother members of the Academy; the extent to which this is so is\ndisputed and difficult to assess. It is also possible that the\nEpicureans, whose aim was also ataraxia, learned something\nfrom Pyrrho; there are indications of an association between Pyrrho\nand Nausiphanes, the teacher of Epicurus. But if so, the extent of the\nEpicureans’ borrowing was strictly limited. For them,\nataraxia is to be attained by coming to understand that the\nuniverse consists of atoms and void; and the Epicureans’ attitude\ntowards the senses was anything but one of mistrust.","contact.mail":"rbett1@jhu.edu","contact.domain":"jhu.edu"}]
