For example, without water and oxygen, there\nwould be no human life; hence these things are necessary conditions\nfor the existence of human beings. Cockneys, according to the\ntraditional definition, are all and only those born within the sound\nof the Bow Bells. Hence birth within the specified area is both a\nnecessary and a sufficient condition for being a Cockney.\n\n\n Like other fundamental concepts, the concepts of necessary and\nsufficient conditions cannot be readily specified in other terms. This\narticle shows how elusive the quest is for a definition of the terms\n“necessary” and “sufficient”, indicating the\nexistence of systematic ambiguity in the concepts of necessary and\nsufficient conditions.  It also shows the connection between puzzles\nover this issue and troublesome issues surrounding the word\n“if” and its use in conditional sentences.\n  \n\n\n\nAn ambition of twentieth-century philosophy was to analyse and refine\nthe definitions of significant terms—and the concepts\nexpressed by them—in the hope of casting light on the tricky\nproblems of, for example, truth, morality, knowledge and existence that\nlay beyond the reach of scientific resolution. Central to this goal\nwas specifying at least in part the conditions to be met for correct\napplication of terms, or under which certain phenomena could truly be\nsaid to be present. Even now, philosophy’s unique contribution to\ninterdisciplinary studies of consciousness, the evolution of\nintelligence, the meaning of altruism, the nature of moral obligation,\nthe scope of justice, the concept of pain, the theory of perception\nand so on still relies on its capacity to bring high degrees of\nconceptual exactness and rigour to arguments in these areas. \n If memory is a capacity for tracking our own past experiences and\nwitnessings then a necessary condition for Penelope remembering giving\na lecture is that it occurred in the past. Contrariwise, that Penelope\nnow remembers the lecture is sufficient for inferring that it was\ngiven in the past. In a well-known attempt to use the terminology of\nnecessary and sufficient conditions to define what it is for one thing\nto be cause of another thing, J. L. Mackie proposed that causes are at\na minimum INUS conditions, that is, “Insufficient but Necessary\nparts of a condition which is itself Unnecessary but Sufficient”\nfor their effects (Mackie 1965). What, then, is a necessary (or a\nsufficient) condition? This article shows that complete precision in\nanswering this question is itself elusive. Although the notion of\nsufficient condition can be used in defining what a necessary\ncondition is (and vice versa), there is no straightforward way to give\na precise and comprehensive account of the meaning of the term\n“necessary (or sufficient) condition”\nitself. Wittgenstein’s warnings against premature theorising and\novergeneralising, and his insight that many everyday terms pick out\nfamilies, should mandate caution over expecting a complete and\nunambiguous specification of what constitutes a necessary, or a\nsufficient, condition. \n\nThe front door is locked. In order to open it (in a normal,\nnon-violent way) and get into the house, I must first use my key. A\nnecessary condition of opening the door, without violence, then, is to\nuse the key.  So it seems true that \nCan we use the truth-functional understanding of “if” to\npropose that the consequent of any conditional (in (i), the consequent\nis “I used the key”) specifies a necessary condition for\nthe truth of the antecedent (in (i), “I opened the door”)?\nMany logic and critical thinking texts use just such an approach, and\nfor convenience we may call it “the standard theory” (see\nBlumberg 1976, pp. 133–4, Hintikka and Bachman 1991, p. 328 for\nexamples of this approach). \n The standard theory makes use of the fact that in classical logic,\nthe truth-function “p ⊃ q”\n(“If p, q”) is false only when p is\ntrue and q is false.  The relation between\n“p” and “q” in this case is\noften referred to as material implication.  On this account of\n“if p, q”, if the conditional\n“p ⊃ q” is true, and p holds,\nthen q also holds; likewise if q fails to be true, then\np must also fail of truth (if the conditional as a whole is to\nbe true). The standard theory thus claims that when the conditional\n“p ⊃ q” is true the truth of the\nconsequent, “q”, is necessary for the truth of the\nantecedent, “p”, and the truth of the antecedent is\nin turn sufficient for the truth of the consequent.  This relation\nbetween necessary and sufficient conditions matches the formal\nequivalence between a conditional formula and its contrapositive\n(“~q ⊃ ~p” is the\ncontrapositive of “p\n⊃ q”). Descending from talk of truth of statements to\nspeaking about states of affairs, we can equally correctly say, on the\nstandard theory, that using the key was necessary for opening the\ndoor. \n\nGiven the standard theory, necessary and sufficient conditions are\nconverses of each other, and so there is a kind of mirroring or\nreciprocity between the two: B’s being a necessary condition\nof A is equivalent to A’s being a sufficient condition\nof B (and vice versa).  So it seems that any truth-functional\nconditional sentence states both a sufficient and a necessary\ncondition as well. Suppose that if Nellie is an elephant, then she has\na trunk. Being an elephant is a sufficient condition of her having a\ntrunk; having a trunk in turn is a necessary condition of Nellie’s\nbeing an elephant. Indeed, the claim about the necessary condition is\nsimply another way of putting the claim about the sufficient\ncondition, just as the contrapositive of a formula is logically\nequivalent to the original formula.  \nIt is also possible to use “only if” to identify a\nnecessary condition: we can say that Jonah was swallowed by a whale\nonly if he was swallowed by a mammal, for if a creature is not a\nmammal, it is not a whale. The standard theory usually maintains that\n“If p, q” and “p only if\nq” are equivalent ways of expressing the truth-functional\n“p ⊃ q”. Equivalent to (i) above, on\nthis account, is the sentence “I opened the door only if I used\nthe key”—a perfectly natural way of indicating that use of\nthe key was necessary for opening the door. \n The account of necessary and sufficient conditions just outlined is\nparticularly apposite in dealing with logical conditions.  For\nexample, from the truth of a conjunction, it can be inferred that each\ncomponent is true (if “p and q” is true,\nthen “p” is true and “q” is\ntrue).  Suppose, then, that it is true that it is both raining and\nsunny.  This is a sufficient condition for “it is raining”\nto be true.  That it is raining is—contrariwise—a\nnecessary condition for it being true that it is both raining and\nsunny. A similar account seems to work for conceptual and definitional\ncontexts. So if the concept of memory is analysed as the concept of a\nfaculty for tracking actual past events, the fact that an event is now\nin the past is a necessary condition of my presently recollecting it.\nIf water is chemically defined as a liquid constituted mainly of\nH2O, then if a glass contains water, it contains mainly\nH2O.  That the glass contains mostly H2O is a necessary\ncondition of its containing water. \nDespite its initial appeal, objections to the standard theory have\nbeen made by theorists from a number of backgrounds.  In summary, the\nobjections build on the idea that “if” in English does not\nalways express a uniform kind of condition.  If different kinds of\nconditions are expressed by the word “if”, the objectors\nargue, then it would be wise to uncover these before engaging in\nattempts to formalize and systematize the concepts of necessary\nand sufficient.  In trying to show that there is an ambiguity\ninfecting “if”-sentences in English, critics have focused\non two doctrines they regard as mistaken: first, that there is a\nreciprocity between necessary and sufficient conditions, and, second,\nthat “if p, q” and “p only if\nq” are equivalent.    \n\nGiven any two true sentences A\nand B, the conditional “If A, then B”\nis true. For example, provided it is true that the sun is made of gas\nand also true that elephants have four legs, then the truth-functional\nconditional “If elephants have four legs, then the sun is made\nof gas” is also true. However, the gaseous nature of the sun\nwould not normally be regarded as either a conceptually, or even\na contingently, necessary condition of the quadripedality of\nelephants. Indeed, according to the standard theory, any truth will be\na necessary condition for the truth of every statement whatsoever, and\nany falsehood will be a sufficient condition for the truth of any\nstatement we care to consider. \n\n These odd results would not arise in some non-classical logics where\nit is required that premisses be relevant to the conclusions drawn\nfrom them, and that the antecedents of true conditionals are likewise\nrelevant to the consequents.  But even in those versions of relevance\nlogic which avoid some of these odd results, it is difficult to avoid\nall of the so-called “paradoxes of implication”.  For\nexample, a contradiction (a statement of the form “p and not\np”) will be a sufficient condition for the truth of any\nstatement unless the semantics for the logic in question allow the\ninclusion of inconsistent worlds (for more details,\nsee logic: relevance, and for an\naccount of relevance in terms of the idea of ‘meaning\ncontainment’ see chapter 1 of Brady 2006). \nThese oddities might be dismissed as mere anomalies were it not for\nthe fact that writers have apparently identified a number of other\nproblems associated with the ideas of reciprocity and equivalence\nmentioned at the end of the previous section.  According to the\nstandard theory, there is a kind of reciprocity between necessary and\nsufficient conditions, and “if p,\nq” sentences can always be paraphrased by “p\nonly if q” ones. However, as writers in linguistics have\nobserved, neither of these claims matches either the most natural\nunderstanding of necessary (and sufficient) conditions, or the\nbehaviour of “if” (and “only if”) in\nEnglish. Consider, for example, the following case (drawn from\nMcCawley 1993, p. 317): \n While in the case of the door, using the key was necessary for\nopening it, no parallel claim seems to work for (ii): in the natural\nreading of this statement, my screaming is not necessary for your\ntouching me. McCawley claims that the “if”-clause in a\nstandard English statement gives the condition—whether\nepistemic, temporal or causal—for the truth of the\n“then”-clause. The natural interpretation of (ii) is that\nmy screaming depends on your touching me. To take my screaming as a\nnecessary condition for your touching me seems to get the dependencies\nback to front.  A similar concern arises if it is maintained that (ii)\nentails that you will touch me only if I scream. \n A similar failure of reciprocity or mirroring arises in the case of\nthe door example ((i) above). While opening the door depended,\ntemporally and causally, on using the key first, it would be wrong to\nthink that using the key depended, either temporally or causally, on\nopening the door. So what kind of condition does the antecedent state?\nTo get clear on this, we can consider a baffling pair of conditional\nsentences (a modification of Sanford 1989, 175–6): \nNotice that these two statements are not equivalent in meaning, even\nthough textbooks standardly treat “if p, q”\nas just another way of saying “p only if q”.\nWhile (iii) states a condition under which I buy Lambert a cello\n(presumably he first learns by using a borrowed one, or maybe he hires\none), (iv) states a necessary condition of Lambert learning to play\nthe instrument in the first place (there may be others too).  Indeed,\nif we take them together, the statements leave poor old Lambert with\nno prospect of ever getting the cello from me.  If (iv) were just\nequivalent to (iii), combining the two statements would not lead to\nan impasse like this. \n But how else can we formulate (iii) in terms of “only if”?  A\nnatural, English equivalent is surprisingly hard to formulate.\nPerhaps it would be something like: \n where the auxiliary (“has”/“have”) has been\nintroduced to try to keep dependencies in order.  Yet (v) is not quite\nright, for it can be read as implying that Lambert’s success is\ndependent on my having first bought him a cello—something that\nis certainly not implied in (iii).  A still better (but not completely\nsatisfactory) version requires further adjustment of the auxiliary,\nsay: \n This time, it is not so easy to read (vi) as implying that I bought\nLambert a cello before he learned to play.  These changes in the\nauxiliary (sometimes described as changes in “tense”) have led some\nwriters to argue that conditionals in English involve implicit\nquantification across times (see, for example, von Fintel\n1998). Assessment of this claim lies beyond the scope of the present\narticle (see the entry on\n  conditionals\n and the detailed discussion in Bennett 2003). \nWhat the case suggests is that different kinds of dependency\nare expressed by use of the conditional construction: (iv) is not\nequivalent to (iii) because the consequent of (iii) provides what might be called a reason for\nthinking that Lambert has learned to play the cello.  By contrast,\nthe very same condition—that I buy Lambert a cello—appears\nto fulfil a different function in (iv) (namely that I first\nhave to buy him a cello before he learns to play).  In the following\nsection, the possibility of distinguishing between different kinds of\nconditions is discussed.  The existence of such distinctions\nis evidence for a systematic ambiguity about the meaning of “if” and in the concepts\nof necessary (and sufficient) condition. \nThe possibility of ambiguity in these concepts raises a further\nproblem for the standard theory. According to it—as von Wright\npointed out (von Wright 1974, 7)—the notions of necessary\ncondition and sufficient condition are themselves interdefinable: \n A is a sufficient condition of B\n=df the absence of A is a necessary\ncondition of the absence of B\n \n B is a necessary condition of A =df\nthe absence of B is a sufficient condition of the absence of\nA\n \nAmbiguity would threaten this neat interdefinability. In the following\nsection, we will explore whether there is an issue of concern\nhere. The possibility of such ambiguity has been explored in work by\nDowning (1959, 1975), Wilson (1979), and has also been raised more\nrecently in Goldstein et al. (2005), ch. 6.  These writers have argued\nthat in some contexts there is a lack of reciprocity between necessary\nand sufficient conditions understood in a certain way, while in other\nsituations the conditions do relate reciprocally to each other in the\nway required by the standard theory.  If these critics are right, and\nambiguity is present, then there is no general conclusion that can\nsafely be drawn about reciprocity, or lack of it, between necessary\nand sufficient conditions. Instead there will be a need to\ndistinguish the sense of condition that is being invoked in a\nparticular context. Without specification of meaning and context, it\nwould also be wrong to make the general claim that sentences like\n“if p, q” are generally paraphrasable as\n“p only if q”.  By means of a semi-formal argument, Carsten Held has suggested a way of explaining why necessary and sufficient conditions are not converses, making appeal to a version of truthmaker theory (Held 2016).  In what follows, we do not follow this route, but instead explore ways of making sense of the lack of reciprocity between the two kinds of conditions in terms of the difference between inferential, evidential and explanatory uses of conditionals. \n\nAre the following two statements equivalent?  (see Wertheimer 1968,\n363–4): \nSanford argues that while (vii) is sensible, (viii) “has things\nbackward” (Sanford 1989, 176–7). He writes: “the\nstatement about the battle, if true, is true because of the occurrence\nof the battle. The battle does not occur because of the truth of the\nstatement” (ibid.) What he probably means is that the\noccurrence of the battle explains the truth of the statement, rather\nthan explanation being the other way around. Of course, people\nsometimes do undertake actions just to ensure that what they had\nformerly said turns out to be true; so there will be cases where the\ntruth of a statement explains the occurrence of an event. But this\nseems an unlikely reading of the sea battle case. \n Now let S be the sentence “There will be a sea battle\ntomorrow”. If S is true today, it is correct to infer\nthat a sea battle will occur tomorrow.  That is, even though the truth\nof the sentence does not explain the occurrence of the battle, the\nfact that it is true licenses the inference to the occurrence of the\nevent. Ascending to the purely formal mode (in Carnap’s sense), we can\nmake the point by explicitly limiting inference relations to ones that\nhold among sentences or other items that can bear truth values. It is\nperfectly proper to infer from the truth of S today that some\nother sentence is true tomorrow, such as “there is a sea battle\ntoday”. Since “there is a sea battle today” is true\ntomorrow if and only if there is a sea battle tomorrow, then we can\ninfer from the fact that S is true today that a sea battle will\noccur tomorrow. \nFrom this observation, it would appear that there is a gap between\nwhat is true of inferences, and what is true of explanations. There is\nan (inferential) sense in which the truth of S is both a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for the occurrence of the sea\nbattle.  However, there is an (explanatory) sense in which the\noccurrence of the sea battle is necessary and sufficient for the truth\nof S, but not vice versa.  It would appear that in\ncases like (vii) and (viii) the inferences run in both\ndirections, while explanations run only one way.  Whether we read\n(vii) as equivalent to (viii) will depend on the sense in which the\nnotions of necessary and sufficient conditions are being deployed. \n Is it possible to generalize this finding?  Our very first example seems to be a case in point.  The fact I used the key explains why I was able\nto open the door without force. That I opened the door without force\ngives a ground for inferring that I used the key. Here is a further\nexample from McCawley: \n John’s winning the race is a sufficient condition for us having a\ncelebration, and his winning the race is the reason why we will be\ncelebrating. Our celebration, however, is not likely to be the reason\nwhy he wins the race. In what sense then is the celebration a\nnecessary condition of John’s winning the race?  Again, there is a\nground for inferring: that we don’t celebrate is a ground for\ninferring that John didn’t win the race. English “tense” usage is\nsensitive to the asymmetry uncovered here, in the way noted in the\nprevious section. The natural way of writing the contrapositive of\n(ix) is not the literal “If we will not celebrate, then John does not\nwin the race”, but rather something like: or or even \nInferential reciprocity and explanatory non-reciprocity seems to be no\ndifferent in the case of conditionals than in the case of logical and\nmathematical equations in general. For example, Newton’s classical\nidentity, f = ma, can be rewritten in equivalent forms\nsuch as a = f/m or\nf/a = m. These all state just the same thing, from an\nalgebraic point of view. Now let us suppose that force is a measure of\nwhat brings a particle to a certain state. Then we would say that\nwhile force causes acceleration, the ratio f/a does not cause,\nor explain, mass, even though it does determine it (see the\nEpilogue of Pearl 2000 for a non-technical attempt at tackling\nthe representation of causal intervention by algebraic notations). \n There are at least three different relations to be\ndistinguished in connection with conditional statements, each of which bears on questions of necessity and sufficiency. First is the\nimplication relation symbolised by the hook operator,\n“⊃” or perhaps some relevant implication operator.\nSuch an operator captures some inferential relations as already noted.\nFor example, we saw that from the truth of a conjunction, it can be\ninferred that each component is true (from “p and\nq”, we can infer that “p” is true and\nthat “q” is true).  Hook, or a relevant implication\noperator, seems to capture one of the relations encountered in the sea\nbattle case, a relation which can be thought of as holding paradigmatically\nbetween bearers of truth values, but can be loosely thought of in\nterms of states of affairs. For this relation, we are able to maintain\nthe standard theory’s reciprocity thesis with the limitations already noted. \n Two further relations, however, are often implicated in reflections\non necessary and sufficient conditions. To identify these, consider\nthe different things that can be meant by saying \n One scenario in terms of which (xiii) can be understood is where\nLambert is invariably a lively contributor to any seminar he\nattends. Moreover, his contributions are always insightful, hence\nguaranteeing an interesting time for all who attend. In this case,\nLambert’s presence explains or was the reason why the seminar was good. A\ndifferent scenario depicts Lambert as someone who has an almost\nunerring knack for spotting which seminars are going to be good, even\nthough he himself is not always active in the discussion. Lambert’s\nattendance at a seminar, according to this story, provides a reason\nfor thinking that the seminar is going to be good.  We might say\nthat according to the first story, the seminar is good because Lambert\nis at it. In the second case, Lambert is at it because it is good.\nExamples of this kind were first introduced in Wilson (1979) inspired\nby the work of Peter Downing (Downing 1959, 1975).  Notice that the\nhook (as understood in classical logic) does not capture the reason\nfor thinking relation, for it permits any truth to be inferred\nfrom any other statement whatever. \n The reason why and reason for thinking that conditions\nmay help to shed light on the peculiarities encountered earlier.  That I\nopened the door is a reason for thinking that I used the key, not a\nreason why.  In case (iii) above, that he learns to play the instrument is the reason why I will buy Lambert a cello, and that I buy him a cello\nis (in the same case) a reason for thinking that—but not a\nreason why—he has learned to play the instrument.  Our\ncelebrating is a reason for thinking that John has won the race in\ncase (ix), but not a reason why. \n Although there is sometimes a correlation between reasons why, on the\none hand, and evidentiary relations, on the other, few generalisations\nabout this can be safely made (although Wilson 1979 puts forward a\nnumber of suggestions about the connections between these\nnotions). If A is a reason why B has occurred (and so perhaps also is evidence that B has occurred), then the occurrence of B will sometimes be a reason for thinking—but not a guarantee—that A has occurred. If A is no more than a reason for thinking that\nB has occurred, then B will sometimes be a reason\nwhy—but not a guarantee that—A has occurred.  Going back to our initial example, my opening the door without violence was\na reason for thinking, that is to say evidence, that I had used the key. That I used the key,\nhowever, was not just a reason for thinking that I had opened the\ndoor, but one of the reasons why I was able to open the door. What is\nimportant is that the “if” clause of a conditional may do any of three things described in the present section.  One of these is well captured by classical truth-functional logic, namely (i) introduce a sentence from which the consequent follows in the way modelled by an operator such as hook.  But there are two other jobs that  “if” may do as well, namely: (ii) state a reason why what is stated in the consequent is the case; (iii) state a reason for thinking that what is stated in the consequent is the case (but not state a reason why it is the case). \nIn general, if explanation is directional, it may not seem surprising that when A explains B, it is not usually the case that B, or its negation, is in turn an explanation\nof A (or its negation).  John’s winning the race explains our celebration, but our failure to celebrate is not (normally) a plausible explanation of his failure to win.  Lambert’s presence may explain why the seminar was such a great success, but a boring seminar is not—in any normal set of circumstances—a reason why Lambert is not at it.  This result undermines the usual understanding that if A is a sufficient condition of B, it will typically be the case that B is a necessary condition\nfor A, and the falsity of B a sufficient condition for the falsity of A.  In defence of contraposition, it might be argued that in the case of causal claims there is at least a weak form of\ncontraposition that is valid. Gomes proposes (Gomes 2009) that where\n‘A’ is claimed to be a causally sufficient\ncondition for ‘B’, or ‘B’ a\ncausally necessary condition of ‘A’, then some form\nof reciprocity between the two kinds of conditions holds, and so\nsome version of contraposition will be valid.  Going back to example\n(ii), suppose we read this as stating a causal condition—that\nyour touching me would cause me to scream.  Gomes suggests that\n‘A’ denotes a sufficient cause of\nB, provided that (1) ‘A’\nspecifies the occurrence of an event that would cause another event\n‘B’, and does this by (2) stating a condition the truth of which is sufficient for inferring the truth of\n‘B’.  In such a case, we could further maintain\nthat ‘B’, in turn, denotes a necessary effect of\n‘A’, meaning that the truth of B\nprovides a necessary condition for the truth of A\n(Gomes 2009, 377–9). This proposal preserves contraposition by treating causal conditionals as inferential.  \n While it is possible to distinguish these different roles the\n“if” clause may play (there may be others too), it is not\nalways easy to isolate them in every case.  The appeal to\n“reasons why” and “reasons for thinking”\nenables us to identify what seem to be ambiguities both in the word “if”\nand in the terminology of necessary and sufficient conditions.\nUnfortunately, the concept of explanation itself is too vague\nto be very helpful here, for we can explain a phenomenon by citing a\nreason for thinking it is the case, or by citing a reason why it is\nthe case.  A similar vagueness infest the word “because”, as we see in a moment.   Consider, for example, cases where mathematical,\nphysical or other laws that are involved\n(one locus classicus for this issue is Sellars 1948).  The truth of “that figure is a polygon” is\nsufficient for inferring “the sum of that figure’s exterior\nangles is 360 degrees”. Likewise, from “the sum of the figure’s exterior angles is not 360 degrees” we can infer “the figure is not a polygon”. Such inferences are not trivial. Rather they depend on geometrical definitions and mathematical principles, and so this is a case of mathematically necessary and sufficient conditions.  But it appears quite plausible that mathematical results also give us at least a\nreason for thinking that because a figure is a polygon its exterior angles will sum to 360 degrees.  We may even be able to think of contexts in which the fact a figure is a polygon provides a reason why its exterior angles sum to 360 degrees.  And it might not be unnatural for someone to remark that a certain figures is a polygon because its exterior angles sum to 360 degrees.  \n A similar point holds for the theory of knowledge where it is generally held that if I know that\np, then p is true. The truth of p is a necessary\ncondition of knowing that p, according to such accounts.\nIn saying this we do not rule out claims stronger than simply\nsaying that the truth of p follows from the fact that we know\nthat p.  That a belief is true—for example—may\nbe (part of) a reason for thinking it constitutes knowledge. Other\ncases involve inferences licensed by physics, biology and the natural\nsciences—inferences that will involve causal or nomic\nconditions. Again there is need for care in determining whether\nreason why or reason for thinking relations are being\nstated. The increase of mean kinetic energy of its molecules does not\njust imply that the temperature of a gas is rising but also provides a\nreason why the temperature is increasing.  However, if temperature is\njust one way of measuring mean molecular kinetic energy, then a change\nin temperature will be a reason for thinking that mean kinetic energy\nof molecules has changed, not a reason why it has changed. \n As mentioned at the start of the article, the specification of\nnecessary and sufficient conditions has traditionally been part of the\nphilosopher’s business of analysis of terms, concepts and phenomena.\nPhilosophical investigations of knowledge, truth, causality,\nconsciousness, memory, justice, altruism and a host of other matters\ndo not aim at stating explanatory relations, but rather at identifying\nand developing conceptual ones (see Jackson 1998 for a detailed\naccount of conceptual analysis). But even here, the temptation to look for reasons why\nor reasons for thinking that is not far away. It might be said that conceptual analysis is like dictionary definition, hence eschewing evidential and explanatory conditions.  But at least evidential conditions seem to be natural consequences of definition and analysis.  That Nellie is an elephant is not a (or the) reason why she is an animal, any more than that a figure is a square is a reason why it has four sides. But some evidential claims seem to make sense even in such contexts: being an elephant apparently gives a reason for thinking that Nellie is an animal, and a certain figure may be said to have four sides because it is a square, in the evidential sense of “because”.   \nTo specify the necessary conditions for the truth of the sentence “that figure is a square” is to specify a number of conditions including “that figure has four sides”, “that figure is on a plane”, and “that figure is closed”. If any one of these latter conditions is false, then the sentence “that figure is a square” is also false.  Conversely, the truth of “that figure is a square” is a sufficient condition for the truth of “that figure is closed”.  The inferential relations in this case are modelled to some extent—albeit inadequately, as noted earlier—by an operator such as hook.  \nNow consider our previous example—that of memory.  That Penelope\nremembers something—according to a standard account of\nmemory—means (among other things) that the thing remembered was\nin the past, and that some previous episode involving Penelope plays\nan appropriate causal role her present recall of the thing in\nquestion.  It would be a mistake to infer from the causal role of some\npast episode in Penelope’s current remembering, that the definition of\nmemory itself involves conditions that are explanatory in the\nreason why sense.  That Penelope now remembers some event is\nnot a reason why it is in the past.  Rather,\nphilosophical treatments of memory seek for conditions that are a\npriori constitutive of the truth of such sentences as\n“Penelope remembers doing X”.  The uncovering of such conditions does not explain Penelope’s now remembering things, but simply provides insight into whether, and how,\n“remember” is to be defined. Reason why and reason for thinking that conditions do not play a role in this part of the philosopher’s enterprise.   \n Finally, it should be noted that not all conditional sentences\nprimarily aim at giving necessary and/or sufficient conditions. A\ncommon case involves what might be called jocular\nconditionals. A friend of Lys mistakenly refers to “Plato’s\nCritique of Pure Reason” and Lys remarks, “If Plato\nwrote the Critique of Pure Reason, then I’m\nAristotle”. Rather than specifying conditions, Lys is engaging\nin a form of reductio argument. Since it is obvious that she is\nnot Aristotle, her joke invites the listener to infer (by\ncontraposition) that Plato did not write the Critique of Pure\nReason. \n\n Given the different roles for “if” just identified, it is\nhardly surprising that generalisations about necessary and/or\nsufficient conditions are hard to formulate. Suppose, for example,\nsomeone tries to state a sufficient condition for a seminar being good\nin a context where the speaker and all the listeners share the view\nthat Lambert’s presence is a reason why seminars would be good. In\nthis case, Lambert’s presence might be said to be a sufficient\ncondition of the seminar being good in the sense that his presence is\na reason why it is good. Now, is there a similar sense in which the\ngoodness of the seminar is a necessary condition of Lambert’s\npresence?  The negative answer to this question is already evident\nfrom the earlier discussion.  If we follow von Wright’s proposal,\nmentioned above, we get the following result: that the seminar is not\ngood is a sufficient condition of Lambert not being present. But this\ncannot plausibly be read as a sufficient condition in anything like\nthe sense of a reason why. At most, the fact of the seminar not being\na good one may be a reason for thinking that Lambert was not at it. So\nhow can we tell, in general, what kind of condition is being expressed\nin an “if” sentence?  As noted in the case of the sea\nbattle, when rewriting in the formal mode captures the sense of what\nis being said, and when the formulations\n“if p, q” and “p only\nif q” seem idiomatically equivalent, then an inferential\ninterpretation will be in order, von Wright’s equivalences will hold,\nand the material conditional gives a reasonable account of\nsuch cases with the limitations pointed out earlier.  \n As already noted, even the inferential use of “if” is not\nalways associated primarily with the business of stating necessary and\nsufficient conditions.  This observation, together with the cases and\ndistinctions introduced in the present article, show the need for\ncaution when we move from natural language conditionals to analysis of\nthem in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, and also the\nneed for caution in modelling the latter conditions by means of\nlogical operators. It appears that there are\nseveral kinds of conditionals, and several kinds of conditions. So\nalthough we can—and do—sometimes use conditional\nstatements to express necessary and sufficient conditions, and can\nexplicate necessary and sufficient conditions by analysis of some of\nthe roles of “if” in natural language conditionals, this\ndoes not give us as much as we might hope for.  In particular, there\nseems to be no general formal scheme for translating between\nconditionals as used in natural language and the statement of any one\nparticular type of condition, or vice versa.","contact.mail":"A.Brennan@latrobe.edu.au","contact.domain":"latrobe.edu.au"}]
