Some aspects of the\nworld, it seems, are perceived through a particular sense. Others,\nlike shape, are perceived through more than one sense. But what sense\nor senses do we use when perceiving time? It is certainly not\nassociated with one particular sense. In fact, it seems odd to say\nthat we see, hear or touch time passing. And indeed, even if all our\nsenses were prevented from functioning for a while, we could still\nnotice the passing of time through the changing pattern of our\nthought. Perhaps, then, we have a special faculty, distinct from the\nfive senses, for detecting time. Or perhaps, as seems more likely, we\nnotice time through perception of other things. But how?\n\n\nTime perception raises a number of intriguing puzzles, including what\nit means to say we perceive time. In this article, we shall\nexplore the various processes through which we are made aware of time,\nand which influence the way we think time really is. Inevitably, we\nshall be concerned with the psychology of time perception, but the\npurpose of the article is to draw out the philosophical issues, and in\nparticular whether and how aspects of our experience can be\naccommodated within certain metaphysical theories concerning the\nnature of time and causation.\n\nThe very expression ‘the perception of time’ invites\nobjection. Insofar as time is something different from events, we do\nnot perceive time as such, but changes or events in\ntime. But, arguably, we do not perceive events only, but also their\ntemporal relations. So, just as it is natural to say that we perceive\nspatial distances and other relations between objects (I see the\ndragonfly as hovering above the surface of the water), it seems\nnatural to talk of perceiving one event following another (the\nthunderclap as following the flash of lightning), though even here\nthere is a difficulty. For what we perceive, we perceive as\npresent—as going on right now. Can we perceive a\nrelation between two events without also perceiving the events\nthemselves? If not, then it seems we perceive both events as present,\nin which case we must perceive them as simultaneous, and so not as\nsuccessive after all. There is then a paradox in the notion of\nperceiving an event as occurring after another, though one that\nperhaps admits of a straightforward solution. When we perceive B as\ncoming after A, we have, surely, ceased to perceive A. In which case,\nA is merely an item in our memory. Now if we wanted to construe\n‘perceive’ narrowly, excluding any element of memory, then\nwe would have to say that we do not, after all, perceive B as\nfollowing A. But in this article, we shall construe\n‘perceive’ more broadly, to include a wide range of\nexperiences of time that essentially involve the senses. In this wide\nsense, we perceive a variety of temporal aspects of the world. We\nshall begin by enumerating these, and then consider accounts of how\nsuch perception is possible. \nThere are a number of what Ernst Pöppel (1978) calls\n‘elementary time experiences’, or fundamental aspects of\nour experience of time. Among these we may list the experience of (i)\nduration; (ii) non-simultaneity; (iii) order; (iv) past and present;\n(v) change, including the passage of time. It might be thought that\nexperience of non-simultaneity is the same as experience of time\norder, but it appears that, when two events occur very close together\nin time, we can be aware that they occur at different times without\nbeing able to say which one came first (see Hirsh and Sherrick 1961).\nWe might also think that perception of order was itself explicable in\nterms of our experience of the distinction between past and present.\nThere will certainly be links here, but it is a contentious question\nwhether the experience of tense—that is, experiencing\nan event as past or present—is more fundamental than the\nexperience of order, or vice versa, or whether indeed there is such a\nthing as the experience of tense at all. This issue is taken up below.\nFinally, we should expect to see links between the perception of time\norder and the perception of motion if the latter simply involves\nperception of the order of the different spatial positions of an\nobject. This is another contentious issue that is taken up below. \nOne of the earliest, and most famous, discussions of the nature and\nexperience of time occurs in the autobiographical Confessions\nof St Augustine. Augustine was born in Numidia (now Algeria) in 354\nAD, held chairs in rhetoric at Carthage and Milan, and become Bishop\nof Hippo in 395. He died in 430. As a young adult, he had rejected\nChristianity, but was finally converted at the age of 32. Book XI of\nthe Confessions contains a long and fascinating exploration\nof time, and its relation to God. During the course of it Augustine\nraises the following conundrum: when we say that an event or interval\nof time is short or long, what is it that is being described as of\nshort or long duration? It cannot be what is past, since that has\nceased to be, and what is non-existent cannot presently have any\nproperties, such as being long. But neither can it be what is present,\nfor the present has no duration. (For the reason why the present must\nbe regarded as durationless, see the section on the specious present,\nbelow.) In any case, while an event is still going on, its duration\ncannot be assessed. \nAugustine’s answer to this riddle is that what we are measuring,\nwhen we measure the duration of an event or interval of time, is in\nthe memory. From this he derives the radical conclusion that past and\nfuture exist only in the mind. While not following Augustine all the\nway to the mind-dependence of other times, we can concede that the\nperception of temporal duration is crucially bound up with memory. It\nis some feature of our memory of the event (and perhaps specifically\nour memory of the beginning and end of the event) that allows us to\nform a belief about its duration. This process need not be described,\nas Augustine describes it, as a matter of measuring something wholly\nin the mind. Arguably, at least, we are measuring the event or\ninterval itself, a mind-independent item, but doing so by means of\nsome psychological process. \nWhatever the process in question is, it seems likely that it is\nintimately connected with what William Friedman (1990) calls\n‘time memory’: that is, memory of when some particular\nevent occurred. That there is a close connection here is entailed by\nthe plausible suggestion that we infer (albeit subconsciously) the\nduration of an event, once it has ceased, from information about how\nlong ago the beginning of that event occurred. That is, information\nthat is metrical in nature (e.g. ‘the burst of sound\nwas very brief’) is derived from tensed information,\nconcerning how far in the past something occurred. The question is how\nwe acquire this tensed information. It may be direct or indirect, a\ncontrast we can illustrate by two models of time memory described by\nFriedman. He calls the first the strength model of time\nmemory. If there is such a thing as a memory trace that persists over\ntime, then we could judge the age of a memory (and therefore how long\nago the event remembered occurred) from the strength of the trace. The\nlonger ago the event, the weaker the trace. This provides a simple and\ndirect means of assessing the duration of an event. Unfortunately, the\ntrace model comes into conflict with a very familiar feature of our\nexperience: that some memories of recent events may fade more quickly\nthan memories of more distant events, especially when those distant\nevents were very salient ones (visiting a rarely seen and frightening\nrelative when one was a child, for instance.) A contrasting account of\ntime memory is the inference model. According to this, the\ntime of an event is not simply read off from some aspect of the memory\nof it, but is inferred from information about relations between the\nevent in question and other events whose date or time is known. \nThe inference model may be plausible enough when we are dealing with\ndistant events, but rather less so for much more recent ones. In\naddition, the model posits a rather complex cognitive operation that\nis unlikely to occur in non-human animals, such as the rat. Rats,\nhowever, are rather good at measuring time over short intervals of up\nto a minute, as demonstrated by instrumental conditioning experiments\ninvolving the ‘free operant procedure’. In this, a given\nresponse (such as depressing a lever) will delay the occurrence of an\nelectric shock by a fixed period of time, such as 40 seconds,\ndescribed as the R-S (response-shock) interval. Eventually, rate of\nresponding tracks the R-S interval, so that the probability of\nresponding increases rapidly as the end of the interval approaches.\n(See Mackintosh 1983 for a discussion of this and related\nexperiments.) It is hard to avoid the inference here that the mere\npassage of time itself is acting as a conditioned stimulus: that the\nrats, to put it in more anthropocentric terms, are successfully\nestimating intervals of time. In this case, the strength model seems\nmore appropriate than the inference model. \nThe term ‘specious present’ was first introduced by the\npsychologist E.R. Clay, but the best known characterisation of it was\ndue to William James, widely regarded as one of the founders of modern\npsychology. He lived from 1842 to 1910, and was professor both of\npsychology and of philosophy at Harvard. His definition of the\nspecious present goes as follows: ‘the prototype of all\nconceived times is the specious present, the short duration of which\nwe are immediately and incessantly sensible’ (James 1890). How\nlong is this specious present? Elsewhere in the same work, James\nasserts ‘We are constantly aware of a certain duration—the\nspecious present—varying from a few seconds to probably not more\nthan a minute, and this duration (with its content perceived as having\none part earlier and another part later) is the original intuition of\ntime.’ This surprising variation in the length of the specious\npresent makes one suspect that more than one definition is hidden in\nJames’ rather vague characterisation.  \nThere are two sources of ambiguity here. One is over whether\n‘the specious present’ refers to the object of the\nexperience, namely a duration in time, or the way in which that object\nis presented to us. The second is over how we should interpret\n‘immediately sensible’. James’ words suggest that\nthe specious present is the duration itself, picked out as the object\nof a certain kind of experience. But ‘ immediately\nsensible’admits of a number of disambiguations. So we could\ndefine the specious present as: \nIf James means the first of these, that would certainly explain his\nsuggestion that it could last up to a minute. But this does not seem\nto have much to do specifically with the experience of\npresentness, since we can certainly hold something in the\nshort-term memory and yet recognise it as past. James may be thinking\nof cases where we are listening to a sentence: if we did not somehow\nhold all the words in our conscious mind, we would not understand the\nsentence as a whole. But it is clear that the words are not\nexperienced as simultaneous, for then the result would be an\nunintelligible jumble of sounds. (2) is illustrated by the familiar\nfact that some movements are so fast that we see them as a blur, such\nas when we look at a fan. What is in fact taking place at different\ntimes is presented as happening in an instant. But this is not\nstandardly what is meant by the specious present. (3) is a construal\nthat is found in the literature (see, e.g., Kelly 2005), but it is not\nobvious that that is what James had in mind, since James is concerned\nwith the phenomenology of time perception, and whether or not an\nexperience constitutes a direct or indirect perception of an interval\ndoes not seem to be a phenomenological matter. (Besides which, as\nKelly points out, we might think it odd to suppose that past parts of\nthe interval could be directly perceived.) \nThat leaves us with (4): a duration which is perceived both as present\nand as temporally extended. This present of experience is\n‘specious’ in that, unlike the objective present (if there\nis such a thing — see\n The metaphysics of time perception\n below) it is an interval and not a durationless instant. The real or\nobjective present must be durationless for, as Augustine argued, in an\ninterval of any duration, there are earlier and later parts. So if any\npart of that interval is present, there will be another part that is\npast or future. \nBut is it possible to perceive something as extended and as present? If\nwe hear a short phrase of music, we seem to hear the phrase as\npresent, and yet — because it is a phrase rather than a single\nchord — we also hear the notes as successive, and therefore as\nextending over an interval. If this does not seem entirely convincing,\nconsider the perception of motion. As Broad (1923) puts it, ‘to\nsee a second-hand moving is quite a different thing from \"seeing\" that\na hour-hand has moved.’ It is not that we see the current\nposition of the second hand and remember where it was a second ago: we\njust see the motion. That leads to the following argument: \nStill, there is more than an air of paradox about this. If successive\nparts of the motion (or musical phrase, or whatever change we\nperceive) are perceived as present, then surely they are perceived as\nsimultaneous. But if they are perceived as simultaneous, then the\nmotion will simply be a blur, as it is in cases where it is too fast\nto perceive as motion. The fact that we do not see it as motion\nsuggests that we do not see the successive parts of it as\nsimultaneous, and so do not see them as present. But then how do we\nexplain the distinction to which Broad directs our attention? \nOne way out of this impasse is to suggest that two quite distinct\nprocesses are going on in the perception of motion (and other kinds of\nchange). One is the perception of successive states as successive, for\nexample the different positions of the second hand. The other is the\nperception of pure movement. This second perception, which may involve\na more primitive system than the first, does not contain as part the\nrecognition of earlier and later elements. (Le Poidevin 2007, Chapter\n5.) Alternatively, we might attempt to explain the phenomena of temporal experience without appeal to the notion of the specious present at all (see Arstila, 2018). \nThe previous section indicated the importance of distinguishing\nbetween perceiving the present and perceiving something as\npresent. We may perceive as present items that are past. Indeed, given\nthe finite speed of the transmission of both light and sound (and the\nfinite speed of transmission of information from receptors to brain),\nit seems that we only ever perceive what is past. However, this does\nnot by itself tell us what it is to perceive something as present,\nrather than as past. Nor does it explain the most striking feature of\nour experience as-of the present: that it is constantly changing. The\npassage (or apparent passage) of time is its most striking feature,\nand any account of our perception of time must account for this aspect\nof our experience. \nHere is one attempt to do so. The first problem is to explain why our\ntemporal experience is limited in a way in which our spatial\nexperience is not. We can perceive objects that stand in a variety of\nspatial relations to us: near, far, to the left or right, up or down,\netc. Our experience is not limited to the immediate vicinity (although\nof course our experience is spatially limited to the extent that\nsufficiently distant objects are invisible to us). But, although we\nperceive the past, we do not perceive it as past, but as present.\nMoreover, our experience does not only appear to be temporally\nlimited, it is so: we do not perceive the future, and we do not\ncontinue to perceive transient events long after information from them\nreached our senses. Now, there is a very simple answer to the question\nwhy we do not perceive the future, and it is a causal one. Briefly,\ncauses always precede their effects; perception is a causal process,\nin that to perceive something is to be causally affected by it;\ntherefore we can only perceive earlier events, never later ones. So\none temporal boundary of our experience is explained; what of the\nother? \nThere seems no logical reason why we should not directly\nexperience the distant past. We could appeal to the principle that\nthere can be no action at a temporal distance, so that something\ndistantly past can only causally affect us via more proximate events.\nBut this is inadequate justification. We can only perceive a spatially\ndistant tree by virtue of its effects on items in our vicinity (light\nreflected off the tree impinging on our retinas), but this is not seen\nby those who espouse a direct realist theory of perception as\nincompatible with their position. We still see the tree, they\nsay, not some more immediate object. Perhaps then we should look for a\ndifferent strategy, such as the following one, which appeals to\nbiological considerations. To be effective agents in the world, we\nmust represent accurately what is currently going on: to be constantly\nout of date in our beliefs while going about our activities would be\nto face pretty immediate extinction. Now we are fortunate in that,\nalthough we only perceive the past it is, in most cases, the very\nrecent past, since the transmission of light and sound, though finite,\nis extremely rapid. Moreover, although things change, they do so,\nagain in most cases, at a rate that is vastly slower than the rate at\nwhich information from external objects travels to us. So when we form\nbeliefs about what is going on in the world, they are largely accurate\nones. (See Butterfield 1984 for a more detailed account along these\nlines.) But, incoming information having been registered, it needs to\nmove into the memory to make way for more up to date information. For,\nalthough things may change slowly relative to the speed of light or of\nsound, they do change, and we cannot afford to be simultaneously\nprocessing conflicting information. So our effectiveness as agents\ndepends on our not continuing to experience a transient state of\naffairs (rather in the manner of a slow motion film) once information\nfrom it has been absorbed. Evolution has ensured that we do not\nexperience anything other than the very recent past (except when we\nare looking at the heavens). \nTo perceive something as present is simply to perceive it: we do not\nneed to postulate some extra item in our experience that is ‘the\nexperience of presentness.’ It follows that there can be no\n‘perception of pastness’. In addition, if pastness were\nsomething we could perceive, then we would perceive\neverything in this way, since every event is past by the time\nwe perceive it. But even if we never perceive anything as past (at the\nsame time as perceiving the event in question) we could intelligibly\ntalk more widely of the experience of pastness: the experience we get\nwhen something comes to an end. And it has been suggested that\nmemories—more specifically, episodic memories, those of\nour experiences of past events—are accompanied by a feeling of\npastness (see Russell 1921). The problem that this suggestion is\nsupposed to solve is that an episodic memory is simply a memory of an\nevent: it represents the event simpliciter, rather than the\nfact that the event is past. So we need to postulate something else\nwhich alerts us to the fact that the event remembered is past. An\nalternative account, and one which does not appeal to any\nphenomenological aspects of memory, is that memories dispose us to\nform past-tensed beliefs, and is by virtue of this that they represent\nan event as past. \nWe have, then, a candidate explanation for our experience of being\nlocated at a particular moment in time, the (specious) present. And as\nthe content of that experience is constantly changing, so that\nposition in time shifts. But there is still a further puzzle. Change\nin our experience is not the same thing as experience of change. We\nwant to know, not just what it is to perceive one event after another,\nbut also what it is to perceive an event as occurring after another.\nOnly then will we understand our experience of the passage of time. We\nturn, then, to the perception of time order. \nHow do we perceive precedence amongst events? A temptingly simple\nanswer is that the perception of precedence is just a sensation caused\nby instances of precedence, just as a sensation of red is caused by\ninstances of redness. Hugh Mellor (1998), who considers this line,\nrejects it for the following reason. If this were the correct\nexplanation, then we could not distinguish between x being\nearlier than y, and x being later\nthan y, for whenever there is an instance of one relation,\nthere is also an instance of the other. But plainly we are able to\ndistinguish the two cases, so it cannot simply be a matter of\nperceiving a relation, but something to do with our perception of the\nrelata. But mere perception of the relata cannot be all there is to\nperceiving precedence. Consider again Broad’s point about the\nsecond hand and the hour hand. We first perceive the hour hand in one\nposition, say pointing to 3 o’clock, and later we perceive it in\na different position, pointing to half-past 3. So I have two\nperceptions, one later than the other. I may also be aware of the\ntemporal relationship of the two positions of the hand. Nevertheless,\nI do not perceive that relationship, in that I do not see the hand\nmoving. In contrast, I do see the second hand move from one position\nto another: I see the successive positions as successive. \nMellor’s proposal is that I perceive x precede\ny by virtue of the fact that my perception of x\ncausally affects my perception of y. As I see the second hand\nin one position, I have in my short-term memory an image (or\ninformation in some form) of its immediately previous position, and\nthis image affects my current perception. The result is a perception\nof movement. The perceived order of different positions need not\nnecessarily be the same as the actual temporal order of those\npositions, but it will be the same as the causal order of the\nperceptions of them. Since causes always precede their\neffects, the temporal order perceived entails a corresponding temporal\norder in the perceptions. Dainton (2001) has objected to this that, if\nthe account were right, we should not be able to remember perceiving\nprecedence, since we only remember what we can genuinely perceive. But\nthere seems no reason to deny that, just because perception of\nprecedence may involve short-term memory, it does not thereby count as\ngenuine perception. \nThere is a further disanalogy between perception of colour and\nperception of time order. What is perceived in the case of colour is\nsomething that has a definite spatio-temporal location. The relation\nof precedence, in contrast, is not something that has any obvious\nlocation. But causes do have locations, so the perception of\nprecedence is rather harder to reconcile with the causal theory of\nperception than the perception of colour (Le Poidevin 2004, 2007). \nIn effect, Mellor’s idea is that the brain represents time by\nmeans of time: that temporally ordered events are represented by\nsimilarly temporally ordered experiences. This would make the\nrepresentation of time unique. (For example, the brain does not\nrepresent spatially separated objects by means of spatially separated\nperceptions, or orange things by orange perceptions.) But why should\ntime be unique in this respect? In other media, time can be\nrepresented spatially (as in cartoons, graphs, and analogue clocks) or\nnumerically (as in calendars and digital clocks). So perhaps the brain\ncan represent time by other means. One reason to suppose that it must\nhave other means at its disposal is that time needs to be represented\nin memory (I recall, both that a was earlier than\nb, and also the experience of seeing a occur before b) and\nintention (I intend to F after I G), but\nthere is no obvious way in which Mellor’s ‘representation\nof time by time’ account can be extended to these. \nOn Mellor’s model, the mechanism by which time-order is\nperceived is sensitive to the time at which perceptions\noccur, but indifferent to their content (what the perceptions\nare of). Daniel Dennett (1991) proposes a different model, on which\nthe process is time-independent, but content-sensitive. For example,\nthe brain may infer the temporal order of events by seeing which\nsequence makes sense of the causal order of those events. One of the\nadvantages of Dennett’s model is that it can account for the\nrather puzzling cases of ‘backwards time referral’, where\nperceived order does not follow the order of perceptions. (See Dennett\n1991 for a discussion of these cases, and also Roache 1999 for an\nattempt to reconcile them with Mellor’s account.) \nIn giving an account of the various aspects of time perception, we\ninevitably make use of concepts that we take to have an objective\ncounterpart in the world: the past, temporal order, causation, change,\nthe passage of time and so on. But one of the most important lessons\nof philosophy, for many writers, is that there may be a gap, perhaps\neven a gulf, between our representation of the world and the world\nitself, even on a quite abstract level. (It would be fair to add that,\nfor other writers, this is precisely not the lesson\nphilosophy teaches.) Philosophy of time is no exception to this.\nIndeed, it is interesting to note how many philosophers have taken the\nview that, despite appearances, time, or some aspect of time, is\nunreal. In this final section, we will take a look at how three\nmetaphysical debates concerning the nature of the world interact with\naccounts of time perception. \nThe first debate concerns the reality of tense, that is, our division\nof time into past, present and future. Is time really divided in this\nway? Does what is present slip further and further into the past? Or\ndoes this picture merely reflect our perspective on a reality in which\nthere is no uniquely privileged moment, the present, but simply an\nordered series of moments? A-theorists say that our ordinary\npicture of the world as tensed reflects the world as it really is: the\npassage of time is an objective fact. B-theorists deny this.\n(The terms A-theory and B-theory derive from McTaggart’s (1908)\ndistinction between two ways in which events can be ordered in time,\neither as an A-series—that is in terms of whether they are past,\npresent or future — or as a B-series—that is according to\nwhether they are earlier than, later than, or simultaneous with other\nevents.) \nFor B-theorists, the only objective temporal facts concern relations\nof precedence and simultaneity between events. (I ignore here the\ncomplications introduced by the Special Theory of Relativity, since\nB-theory—and perhaps A-theory also—can be reformulated in\nterms which are compatible with the Special Theory.) B-theorists do\nnot deny that our tensed beliefs, such as the belief that a cold front\nis now passing, or that Sally’s wedding was two\nyears ago, may be true, but they assert that what makes such\nbeliefs true are not facts about the pastness, presentness or futurity\nof events, but tenseless facts concerning precedence and simultaneity\n(see Mellor 1998, Oaklander and Smith 1994). On one version of the\nB-theory, for example, my belief that there is a cold front now\npassing is true because the passing of the front is simultaneous\nwith my forming the belief. Now one very serious challenge to the\ntenseless theorist is to explain why, if time does not pass in\nreality, it appears to do so. What, in B-theoretic terms, is the basis\nfor our experience as-of the passage of time? \nThe accounts we considered above, first of the temporal restrictions\non our experience, and secondly of our experience of time order, did\nnot explicitly appeal to tensed, or A-theoretic notions. The facts we\ndid appeal to look like purely B-theoretic ones: that causes are\nalways earlier than their effects, that things typically change slowly\nin relation to the speed of transmission of light and sound, that our\ninformation-processing capacities are limited, and that there can be\ncausal connections between memories and experiences. So it may be that\nthe tenseless theorist can discharge the obligation to explain why\ntime seems to pass. But two doubts remain. First, perhaps the A-\ntheorist can produce a simpler explanation of our experience. Second,\nit may turn out that supposedly B-series facts are dependent upon\nA-series ones, so that, for example, a and b are\nsimultaneous by virtue of the fact that both are present. \nWhat is clear, though, is that there is no direct argument from\nexperience to the A-theory, since the present of experience, being\ntemporally extended and concerning the past, is very different from\nthe objective present postulated by the A-theory. Further, it cannot\nbe taken for granted that the objective passage of time would explain\nwhatever it is that the experience as-of time’s passage is\nsupposed to amount to. (See Prosser 2005, 2007, 2012, 2016, 2018.) \nThe second metaphysical issue that has a crucial bearing on time\nperception is connected with the A/B-theory dispute, and that is the\ndebate between presentists and eternalists. Presentists hold that only\nthe present exists (for an articulation of various kinds of\npresentism, and the challenges they face, see Bourne 2006), whereas\neternalists grant equal reality to all times. the two debates, A-\nversus B-theory and presentism versus eternalism, do not map precisely\nonto each other. Arguably, B-theory is committed to eternalism, but\nA-theorists may not necessarily endorse presentism (though Bourne\nargues that they should). \nHow might his be connected to perception? According to the indirect\n(or, as it is sometimes called, representative) theory of perception,\nwe perceive external objects only by perceiving some intermediate\nobject, a sense datum. According to the direct theory, in contrast,\nperception of external objects involves no such intermediary. Now,\nexternal objects are at varying distances from us, and, as noted\nabove, since light and sound travel at finite speeds, that means that\nthe state of objects that we perceive will necessarily lie in the\npast. In the case of stars, where the distances are very considerable,\nthe time gap between light leaving the star and our perceiving it may\nbe one of many years. The presentist holds that past states, events\nand objects are no longer real. But if all that we perceive in the\nexternal world is past, then it seems that the objects of our\nperception (or at least the states of those objects that we perceive)\nare unreal. It is hard to reconcile this with the direct theory of\nperception. It looks on the face of it, therefore, that presentists\nare committed to the indirect theory of perception. (See Power 2010a,\n2010b, 2018, Le Poidevin 2015b.) \nThe third and final metaphysical issue that we will discuss in the\ncontext of time perception concerns causal asymmetry. The account of\nour sense of being located at a time which we considered under\n Past, present and the passage of time\n rested on the assumption that causation is asymmetric. Later events,\nit was suggested, cannot affect earlier ones, as a matter of\nmind-independent fact, and this is why we do not perceive the future,\nonly the past. But attempts to explain the basis of causal asymmetry,\nin terms for example of counterfactual dependence, or in probabilistic\nterms, are notoriously problematic. One moral we might draw from the\ndifficulties of reducing causal asymmetry to other asymmetries is that\ncausal asymmetry is primitive, and so irreducible. Another is that\nthat the search for a mind-independent account is mistaken. Perhaps\ncausation in intrinsically symmetric, but some feature of our\npsychological constitution and relation to the world makes causation\nappear asymmetric. This causal perspectivalism is the line\ntaken by Huw Price (1996). That causal asymmetry should be explained\nin part by our psychological constitution, in a way analogous to our\nunderstanding of secondary qualities such as colour, is a radical\nreversal of our ordinary assumptions, but then our ordinary\nunderstanding of a number of apparently objective features of the\nworld—tense, absolute simultaneity—have met with similarly\nradical challenges. Now, if causal asymmetry is mind-dependent in this\nway, then we cannot appeal to it in accounting for our experience of\ntemporal asymmetry—the difference between past and future. \nFurther, it is not at all clear that perspectivalism can account for\nthe perception of time order. The mechanism suggested by Mellor (see\n Time Order)\n exploited the asymmetry of causation: it is the fact that the\nperception of A causally influences the perception of B, but not vice\nversa, that gives rise to the perception of A’s being followed\nby B. We can represent this schematically as follows (where the arrow\nstands for an asymmetric causal relation): \nBut if there is no objective asymmetry, then what is the explanation?\nOf course, we can still define causal order in terms of a causal\nbetweenness relation, and we can say that the perceived order follows\nthe objective causal order of the perceptions, in this sense: on the one hand, where A\nis perceived as being followed by B, then the perception of B is\nalways causally between the perception of A and the perception of\nA’s being followed by B (the dash represents a symmetric causal\nrelation): \nOn the other hand, where B is perceived as being followed by A, the perception\nof A is always causally between the perception of B and the perception\nof B’s being followed by A: \nBut what, on the causal perspectivalist view, would rule out the\nfollowing case? \nFor such a case would satisfy the above constraints. But it is a case\nin which A is perceived by an observer both as following, and as being\nfollowed by, B, and we know that such a case never occurs in\nexperience. ‘Is perceived by x as followed by’ is\nan asymmetric relation (assuming we are dealing with a single sense\nmodality), and so one that can be grounded in the causal relation only\nif the causal relation is itself asymmetric. Now if perspectivalism\ncannot meet the challenge to explain why, when B is perceived as\nfollowing A, A is never perceived by the same observer as following B,\nit seems that our experience of time order, insofar as it has a causal\nexplanation, requires causation to be objectively asymmetric. \nOne strategy the causal perspectivalist could adopt (indeed, the only\none available) is to explain the asymmetric principle above in terms\nof some objective non-causal asymmetry. Price, for example, allows an\nobjective thermodynamic asymmetry, in that an ordered series of states\nof the universe will exhibit what he calls a thermodynamic gradient:\nentropy will be lower at one end of the series than at the end. We\nshould resist the temptation to say that entropy increases, for that\nwould be like asserting that a road goes uphill rather than downhill\nwithout conceding the perspectival nature of descriptions like\n‘uphill’. Could such a thermodynamic asymmetry explain the\nperception of time order? That is a question for the reader to\nponder.","contact.mail":"r.d.lepoidevin@leeds.ac.uk","contact.domain":"leeds.ac.uk"}]
