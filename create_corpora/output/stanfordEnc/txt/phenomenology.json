The central structure\nof an experience is its intentionality, its being directed toward\nsomething, as it is an experience of or about some object. An\nexperience is directed toward an object by virtue of its content or\nmeaning (which represents the object) together with appropriate\nenabling conditions.\n\n\n\nPhenomenology as a discipline is distinct from but related to other\nkey disciplines in philosophy, such as ontology, epistemology, logic,\nand ethics. Phenomenology has been practiced in various guises for\ncenturies, but it came into its own in the early 20th century in the\nworks of Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty and others.\nPhenomenological issues of intentionality, consciousness, qualia, and\nfirst-person perspective have been prominent in recent philosophy of\nmind.\n\n\n\nPhenomenology is commonly understood in either of two ways: as a\ndisciplinary field in philosophy, or as a movement in the history of\nphilosophy. \n\nThe discipline of phenomenology may be defined initially as the\nstudy of structures of experience, or consciousness. Literally,\nphenomenology is the study of “phenomena”: appearances of things, or\nthings as they appear in our experience, or the ways we experience\nthings, thus the meanings things have in our experience. Phenomenology\nstudies conscious experience as experienced from the subjective or\nfirst person point of view. This field of philosophy is then to be\ndistinguished from, and related to, the other main fields of\nphilosophy: ontology (the study of being or what is), epistemology (the\nstudy of knowledge), logic (the study of valid reasoning), ethics (the\nstudy of right and wrong action), etc. \n\nThe historical movement of phenomenology is the philosophical\ntradition launched in the first half of the 20th century by\nEdmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jean-Paul\nSartre, et al. In that movement, the discipline of\nphenomenology was prized as the proper foundation of all \nphilosophy—as opposed, say, to ethics or metaphysics or epistemology. The\nmethods and characterization of the discipline were widely debated by\nHusserl and his successors, and these debates continue to the present\nday. (The definition of phenomenology offered above will thus be\ndebatable, for example, by Heideggerians, but it remains the starting\npoint in characterizing the discipline.) \n\nIn recent philosophy of mind, the term “phenomenology” is often\nrestricted to the characterization of sensory qualities of seeing,\nhearing, etc.: what it is like to have sensations of various kinds.\nHowever, our experience is normally much richer in content than mere\nsensation. Accordingly, in the phenomenological tradition,\nphenomenology is given a much wider range, addressing the meaning\nthings have in our experience, notably, the significance of objects,\nevents, tools, the flow of time, the self, and others, as these things\narise and are experienced in our “life-world”. \n\nPhenomenology as a discipline has been central to the tradition of\ncontinental European philosophy throughout the 20th century,\nwhile philosophy of mind has evolved in the Austro-Anglo-American\ntradition of analytic philosophy that developed throughout the\n20th century. Yet the fundamental character of our mental\nactivity is pursued in overlapping ways within these two traditions.\nAccordingly, the perspective on phenomenology drawn in this article\nwill accommodate both traditions. The main concern here will be to\ncharacterize the discipline of phenomenology, in a contemporary\npurview, while also highlighting the historical tradition that brought\nthe discipline into its own. \n\nBasically, phenomenology studies the structure of various types of\nexperience ranging from perception, thought, memory, imagination,\nemotion, desire, and volition to bodily awareness, embodied action, and\nsocial activity, including linguistic activity. The structure of these\nforms of experience typically involves what Husserl called\n“intentionality”, that is, the directedness of experience toward things\nin the world, the property of consciousness that it is a consciousness\nof or about something. According to classical Husserlian phenomenology,\nour experience is directed toward—represents or \n“intends”—things only through particular concepts, thoughts,\nideas, images, etc. These make up the meaning or content of a given\nexperience, and are distinct from the things they present or mean. \n\nThe basic intentional structure of consciousness, we find in\nreflection or analysis, involves further forms of experience. Thus,\nphenomenology develops a complex account of temporal awareness (within\nthe stream of consciousness), spatial awareness (notably in\nperception), attention (distinguishing focal and marginal or\n“horizonal” awareness), awareness of one’s own experience\n(self-consciousness, in one sense), self-awareness\n(awareness-of-oneself), the self in different roles (as thinking,\nacting, etc.), embodied action (including kinesthetic awareness of\none’s movement), purpose or intention in action (more or less\nexplicit), awareness of other persons (in empathy, intersubjectivity,\ncollectivity), linguistic activity (involving meaning, communication,\nunderstanding others), social interaction (including collective\naction), and everyday activity in our surrounding life-world (in a\nparticular culture). \n\nFurthermore, in a different dimension, we find various grounds or\nenabling conditions—conditions of the possibility—of\nintentionality, including embodiment, bodily skills, cultural context,\nlanguage and other social practices, social background, and contextual\naspects of intentional activities. Thus, phenomenology leads from\nconscious experience into conditions that help to give experience its\nintentionality. Traditional phenomenology has focused on subjective,\npractical, and social conditions of experience. Recent philosophy of\nmind, however, has focused especially on the neural substrate of\nexperience, on how conscious experience and mental representation or\nintentionality are grounded in brain activity. It remains a difficult\nquestion how much of these grounds of experience fall within the\nprovince of phenomenology as a discipline. Cultural conditions thus\nseem closer to our experience and to our familiar self-understanding\nthan do the electrochemical workings of our brain, much less our\ndependence on quantum-mechanical states of physical systems to which we\nmay belong. The cautious thing to say is that phenomenology leads in\nsome ways into at least some background conditions of our\nexperience. \n\nThe discipline of phenomenology is defined by its domain of study,\nits methods, and its main results. \n\nPhenomenology studies structures of conscious experience as\nexperienced from the first-person point of view, along with relevant\nconditions of experience. The central structure of an experience is its\nintentionality, the way it is directed through its content or meaning\ntoward a certain object in the world. \n\nWe all experience various types of experience including perception,\nimagination, thought, emotion, desire, volition, and action. Thus, the\ndomain of phenomenology is the range of experiences including these\ntypes (among others). Experience includes not only relatively passive\nexperience as in vision or hearing, but also active experience as in\nwalking or hammering a nail or kicking a ball. (The range will be\nspecific to each species of being that enjoys consciousness; our focus\nis on our own, human, experience. Not all conscious beings will, or\nwill be able to, practice phenomenology, as we do.) \n\nConscious experiences have a unique feature: we experience\nthem, we live through them or perform them. Other things in the world\nwe may observe and engage. But we do not experience them, in the sense\nof living through or performing them. This experiential or first-person\nfeature—that of being experienced—is an essential part\nof the nature or structure of conscious experience: as we say, “I see /\nthink / desire / do …” This feature is both a phenomenological\nand an ontological feature of each experience: it is part of what it is\nfor the experience to be experienced (phenomenological) and part of\nwhat it is for the experience to be (ontological). \n\nHow shall we study conscious experience? We reflect on various types\nof experiences just as we experience them. That is to say, we proceed\nfrom the first-person point of view. However, we do not normally\ncharacterize an experience at the time we are performing it. In many\ncases we do not have that capability: a state of intense anger or fear,\nfor example, consumes all of one’s psychic focus at the time. Rather,\nwe acquire a background of having lived through a given type of\nexperience, and we look to our familiarity with that type of\nexperience: hearing a song, seeing a sunset, thinking about love,\nintending to jump a hurdle. The practice of phenomenology assumes such\nfamiliarity with the type of experiences to be characterized.\nImportantly, also, it is types of experience that phenomenology\npursues, rather than a particular fleeting experience—unless\nits type is what interests us. \n\nClassical phenomenologists practiced some three distinguishable\nmethods. (1) We describe a type of experience just as we find it in our\nown (past) experience. Thus, Husserl and Merleau-Ponty spoke of pure\ndescription of lived experience. (2) We interpret a type of experience\nby relating it to relevant features of context. In this vein, Heidegger\nand his followers spoke of hermeneutics, the art of interpretation in\ncontext, especially social and linguistic context. (3) We analyze the\nform of a type of experience. In the end, all the classical\nphenomenologists practiced analysis of experience, factoring out\nnotable features for further elaboration. \n\nThese traditional methods have been ramified in recent decades,\nexpanding the methods available to phenomenology. Thus: (4) In a\nlogico-semantic model of phenomenology, we specify the truth conditions\nfor a type of thinking (say, where I think that dogs chase cats) or the\nsatisfaction conditions for a type of intention (say, where I intend or\nwill to jump that hurdle). (5) In the experimental paradigm of\ncognitive neuroscience, we design empirical experiments that tend to\nconfirm or refute aspects of experience (say, where a brain scan shows\nelectrochemical activity in a specific region of the brain thought to\nsubserve a type of vision or emotion or motor control). This style of\n“neurophenomenology” assumes that conscious experience is grounded in\nneural activity in embodied action in appropriate \nsurroundings—mixing pure phenomenology with biological and physical science in a way\nthat was not wholly congenial to traditional phenomenologists. \n\nWhat makes an experience conscious is a certain awareness one has of\nthe experience while living through or performing it. This form of\ninner awareness has been a topic of considerable debate, centuries\nafter the issue arose with Locke’s notion of self-consciousness on the\nheels of Descartes’ sense of consciousness (conscience,\nco-knowledge). Does this awareness-of-experience consist in a kind of\ninner observation of the experience, as if one were doing two things at\nonce? (Brentano argued no.) Is it a higher-order perception of one’s\nmind’s operation, or is it a higher-order thought about one’s mental\nactivity? (Recent theorists have proposed both.) Or is it a different\nform of inherent structure? (Sartre took this line, drawing on Brentano\nand Husserl.) These issues are beyond the scope of this article, but\nnotice that these results of phenomenological analysis shape the\ncharacterization of the domain of study and the methodology appropriate\nto the domain. For awareness-of-experience is a defining trait of\nconscious experience, the trait that gives experience a first-person,\nlived character. It is that lived character of experience that allows a\nfirst-person perspective on the object of study, namely, experience,\nand that perspective is characteristic of the methodology of\nphenomenology. \n\nConscious experience is the starting point of phenomenology, but\nexperience shades off into less overtly conscious phenomena. As Husserl\nand others stressed, we are only vaguely aware of things in the margin\nor periphery of attention, and we are only implicitly aware of the\nwider horizon of things in the world around us. Moreover, as Heidegger\nstressed, in practical activities like walking along, or hammering a\nnail, or speaking our native tongue, we are not explicitly conscious of\nour habitual patterns of action. Furthermore, as psychoanalysts have\nstressed, much of our intentional mental activity is not conscious at\nall, but may become conscious in the process of therapy or\ninterrogation, as we come to realize how we feel or think about\nsomething. We should allow, then, that the domain of \nphenomenology—our own experience—spreads out from conscious\nexperience into semi-conscious and even unconscious mental activity,\nalong with relevant background conditions implicitly invoked in our\nexperience. (These issues are subject to debate; the point here is to\nopen the door to the question of where to draw the boundary of the\ndomain of phenomenology.) \n\nTo begin an elementary exercise in phenomenology, consider some\ntypical experiences one might have in everyday life, characterized in\nthe first person: \n\nHere are rudimentary characterizations of some familiar types of\nexperience. Each sentence is a simple form of phenomenological\ndescription, articulating in everyday English the structure of the type\nof experience so described. The subject term “I” indicates the\nfirst-person structure of the experience: the intentionality proceeds\nfrom the subject. The verb indicates the type of intentional activity\ndescribed: perception, thought, imagination, etc. Of central importance\nis the way that objects of awareness are presented or intended in our\nexperiences, especially, the way we see or conceive or think about\nobjects. The direct-object expression (“that fishing boat off the\ncoast”) articulates the mode of presentation of the object in the\nexperience: the content or meaning of the experience, the core of what\nHusserl called noema. In effect, the object-phrase expresses the noema\nof the act described, that is, to the extent that language has\nappropriate expressive power. The overall form of the given sentence\narticulates the basic form of intentionality in the experience:\nsubject-act-content-object. \n\nRich phenomenological description or interpretation, as in Husserl,\nMerleau-Ponty et al., will far outrun such simple\nphenomenological descriptions as above. But such simple descriptions\nbring out the basic form of intentionality. As we interpret the\nphenomenological description further, we may assess the relevance of\nthe context of experience. And we may turn to wider conditions of the\npossibility of that type of experience. In this way, in the practice of\nphenomenology, we classify, describe, interpret, and analyze structures\nof experiences in ways that answer to our own experience. \n\nIn such interpretive-descriptive analyses of experience, we\nimmediately observe that we are analyzing familiar forms of\nconsciousness, conscious experience of or about this or that.\nIntentionality is thus the salient structure of our experience, and\nmuch of phenomenology proceeds as the study of different aspects of\nintentionality. Thus, we explore structures of the stream of\nconsciousness, the enduring self, the embodied self, and bodily action.\nFurthermore, as we reflect on how these phenomena work, we turn to the\nanalysis of relevant conditions that enable our experiences to occur as\nthey do, and to represent or intend as they do. Phenomenology then\nleads into analyses of conditions of the possibility of intentionality,\nconditions involving motor skills and habits, background social\npractices, and often language, with its special place in human\naffairs. \n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary presents the following\ndefinition: “Phenomenology. a. The science of phenomena as distinct\nfrom being (ontology). b. That division of any science which describes\nand classifies its phenomena. From the Greek phainomenon,\nappearance.” In philosophy, the term is used in the first sense, amid\ndebates of theory and methodology. In physics and philosophy of\nscience, the term is used in the second sense, albeit only\noccasionally. \n\nIn its root meaning, then, phenomenology is the study of\nphenomena: literally, appearances as opposed to reality. This\nancient distinction launched philosophy as we emerged from Plato’s\ncave. Yet the discipline of phenomenology did not blossom until the\n20th century and remains poorly understood in many circles of\ncontemporary philosophy. What is that discipline? How did philosophy\nmove from a root concept of phenomena to the discipline of\nphenomenology? \n\nOriginally, in the 18th century, “phenomenology” meant the\ntheory of appearances fundamental to empirical knowledge, especially\nsensory appearances.  The Latin term “Phenomenologia” was\nintroduced by Christoph Friedrich Oetinger in 1736.  Subsequently, the\nGerman term “Phänomenologia” was used by Johann\nHeinrich Lambert, a follower of Christian Wolff. Immanuel Kant used\nthe term occasionally in various writings, as did Johann Gottlieb\nFichte.  In 1807, G. W. F. Hegel wrote a book\ntitled Phänomenologie des Geistes (usually translated\nas Phenomenology of Spirit). By 1889 Franz Brentano used the\nterm to characterize what he called “descriptive\npsychology”. From there Edmund Husserl took up the term for his\nnew science of consciousness, and the rest is history. \n\nSuppose we say phenomenology studies phenomena: what appears to \nus—and its appearing. How shall we understand phenomena? The term\nhas a rich history in recent centuries, in which we can see traces of\nthe emerging discipline of phenomenology. \n\nIn a strict empiricist vein, what appears before the mind are\nsensory data or qualia: either patterns of one’s own sensations (seeing\nred here now, feeling this ticklish feeling, hearing that resonant bass\ntone) or sensible patterns of worldly things, say, the looks and smells\nof flowers (what John Locke called secondary qualities of things). In a\nstrict rationalist vein, by contrast, what appears before the mind are\nideas, rationally formed “clear and distinct ideas” (in René\nDescartes’ ideal). In Immanuel Kant’s theory of knowledge, fusing\nrationalist and empiricist aims, what appears to the mind are phenomena\ndefined as things-as-they-appear or things-as-they-are-represented (in\na synthesis of sensory and conceptual forms of objects-as-known). In\nAuguste Comte’s theory of science, phenomena (phenomenes) are\nthe facts (faits, what occurs) that a given science would\nexplain. \n\nIn 18th and 19th century epistemology, then,\nphenomena are the starting points in building knowledge, especially\nscience. Accordingly, in a familiar and still current sense, phenomena\nare whatever we observe (perceive) and seek to explain. \n\nAs the discipline of psychology emerged late in the 19th\ncentury, however, phenomena took on a somewhat different guise. In\nFranz Brentano’s Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint\n(1874), phenomena are what occur in the mind: mental phenomena are acts\nof consciousness (or their contents), and physical phenomena are\nobjects of external perception starting with colors and shapes. For\nBrentano, physical phenomena exist “intentionally” in acts of\nconsciousness. This view revives a Medieval notion Brentano called\n“intentional in-existence”, but the ontology remains undeveloped (what\nis it to exist in the mind, and do physical objects exist only in the\nmind?). More generally, we might say, phenomena are whatever we are\nconscious of: objects and events around us, other people, ourselves,\neven (in reflection) our own conscious experiences, as we experience\nthese. In a certain technical sense, phenomena are things as\nthey are given to our consciousness, whether in perception or\nimagination or thought or volition. This conception of phenomena would\nsoon inform the new discipline of phenomenology. \n\nBrentano distinguished descriptive psychology from\ngenetic psychology. Where genetic psychology seeks the causes\nof various types of mental phenomena, descriptive psychology defines\nand classifies the various types of mental phenomena, including\nperception, judgment, emotion, etc. According to Brentano, every mental\nphenomenon, or act of consciousness, is directed toward some object,\nand only mental phenomena are so directed. This thesis of intentional\ndirectedness was the hallmark of Brentano’s descriptive psychology. In\n1889 Brentano used the term “phenomenology” for descriptive psychology,\nand the way was paved for Husserl’s new science of phenomenology. \n\nPhenomenology as we know it was launched by Edmund Husserl in his\nLogical Investigations (1900–01). Two importantly different\nlines of theory came together in that monumental work: psychological\ntheory, on the heels of Franz Brentano (and also William James, whose\nPrinciples of Psychology appeared in 1891 and greatly\nimpressed Husserl); and logical or semantic theory, on the heels of\nBernard Bolzano and Husserl’s contemporaries who founded modern logic,\nincluding Gottlob Frege. (Interestingly, both lines of research trace\nback to Aristotle, and both reached importantly new results in\nHusserl’s day.) \n\nHusserl’s Logical Investigations was inspired by Bolzano’s\nideal of logic, while taking up Brentano’s conception of descriptive\npsychology. In his Theory of Science (1835) Bolzano\ndistinguished between subjective and objective ideas or representations\n(Vorstellungen). In effect Bolzano criticized Kant and before\nhim the classical empiricists and rationalists for failing to make this\nsort of distinction, thereby rendering phenomena merely subjective.\nLogic studies objective ideas, including propositions, which in turn\nmake up objective theories as in the sciences. Psychology would, by\ncontrast, study subjective ideas, the concrete contents (occurrences)\nof mental activities in particular minds at a given time. Husserl was\nafter both, within a single discipline. So phenomena must be\nreconceived as objective intentional contents (sometimes called\nintentional objects) of subjective acts of consciousness. Phenomenology\nwould then study this complex of consciousness and correlated\nphenomena. In Ideas I (Book One, 1913) Husserl introduced two\nGreek words to capture his version of the Bolzanoan distinction:\nnoesis and noema, from the Greek verb\nnoéō (νοέω), meaning to\nperceive, think, intend, whence the noun nous or mind. The\nintentional process of consciousness is called noesis, while\nits ideal content is called\nnoema. The noema of an act of consciousness Husserl\ncharacterized both as an ideal meaning and as “the object as\nintended”. Thus the phenomenon, or object-as-it-appears, becomes the\nnoema, or object-as-it-is-intended. The interpretations of Husserl’s\ntheory of noema have been several and amount to different developments\nof Husserl’s basic theory of intentionality. (Is the noema an aspect of\nthe object intended, or rather a medium of intention?) \n\nFor Husserl, then, phenomenology integrates a kind of psychology\nwith a kind of logic. It develops a descriptive or analytic psychology\nin that it describes and analyzes types of subjective mental activity\nor experience, in short, acts of consciousness. Yet it develops a kind\nof logic—a theory of meaning (today we say logical \nsemantics)—in that it describes and analyzes objective contents of\nconsciousness: ideas, concepts, images, propositions, in short, ideal\nmeanings of various types that serve as intentional contents, or\nnoematic meanings, of various types of experience. These contents are\nshareable by different acts of consciousness, and in that sense they\nare objective, ideal meanings. Following Bolzano (and to some extent\nthe platonistic logician Hermann Lotze), Husserl opposed any reduction\nof logic or mathematics or science to mere psychology, to how people\nhappen to think, and in the same spirit he distinguished phenomenology\nfrom mere psychology. For Husserl, phenomenology would study\nconsciousness without reducing the objective and shareable meanings\nthat inhabit experience to merely subjective happenstances. Ideal\nmeaning would be the engine of intentionality in acts of\nconsciousness. \n\nA clear conception of phenomenology awaited Husserl’s development of\na clear model of intentionality. Indeed, phenomenology and the modern\nconcept of intentionality emerged hand-in-hand in Husserl’s Logical\nInvestigations (1900–01). With theoretical foundations laid in the\nInvestigations, Husserl would then promote the radical new\nscience of phenomenology in Ideas I (1913). And alternative\nvisions of phenomenology would soon follow. \n\nPhenomenology came into its own with Husserl, much as epistemology\ncame into its own with Descartes, and ontology or metaphysics came into\nits own with Aristotle on the heels of Plato. Yet phenomenology has\nbeen practiced, with or without the name, for many centuries. When\nHindu and Buddhist philosophers reflected on states of consciousness\nachieved in a variety of meditative states, they were practicing\nphenomenology. When Descartes, Hume, and Kant characterized states of\nperception, thought, and imagination, they were practicing\nphenomenology. When Brentano classified varieties of mental phenomena\n(defined by the directedness of consciousness), he was practicing\nphenomenology. When William James appraised kinds of mental activity in\nthe stream of consciousness (including their embodiment and their\ndependence on habit), he too was practicing phenomenology. And when\nrecent analytic philosophers of mind have addressed issues of\nconsciousness and intentionality, they have often been practicing\nphenomenology. Still, the discipline of phenomenology, its roots\ntracing back through the centuries, came to full flower in Husserl. \n\nHusserl’s work was followed by a flurry of phenomenological writing\nin the first half of the 20th century. The diversity of\ntraditional phenomenology is apparent in the Encyclopedia of\nPhenomenology (Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1997, Dordrecht and\nBoston), which features separate articles on some seven types of\nphenomenology. (1) Transcendental constitutive phenomenology studies\nhow objects are constituted in pure or transcendental consciousness,\nsetting aside questions of any relation to the natural world around us.\n(2) Naturalistic constitutive phenomenology studies how consciousness\nconstitutes or takes things in the world of nature, assuming with the\nnatural attitude that consciousness is part of nature. (3) Existential\nphenomenology studies concrete human existence, including our\nexperience of free choice or action in concrete situations. (4)\nGenerative historicist phenomenology studies how meaning, as found in\nour experience, is generated in historical processes of collective\nexperience over time. (5) Genetic phenomenology studies the genesis of\nmeanings of things within one’s own stream of experience. (6)\nHermeneutical phenomenology studies interpretive structures of\nexperience, how we understand and engage things around us in our human\nworld, including ourselves and others. (7) Realistic phenomenology\nstudies the structure of consciousness and intentionality, assuming it\noccurs in a real world that is largely external to consciousness and\nnot somehow brought into being by consciousness. \n\nThe most famous of the classical phenomenologists were Husserl,\nHeidegger, Sartre, and Merleau-Ponty. In these four thinkers we find\ndifferent conceptions of phenomenology, different methods, and\ndifferent results. A brief sketch of their differences will capture\nboth a crucial period in the history of phenomenology and a sense of\nthe diversity of the field of phenomenology. \n\nIn his Logical Investigations (1900–01) Husserl outlined a\ncomplex system of philosophy, moving from logic to philosophy of\nlanguage, to ontology (theory of universals and parts of wholes), to a\nphenomenological theory of intentionality, and finally to a\nphenomenological theory of knowledge. Then in Ideas I (1913)\nhe focused squarely on phenomenology itself. Husserl defined\nphenomenology as “the science of the essence of consciousness”,\ncentered on the defining trait of intentionality, approached explicitly\n“in the first person”. (See Husserl, Ideas I,\n¤¤33ff.) In this spirit, we may say phenomenology is the\nstudy of consciousness—that is, conscious experience of various\ntypes—as experienced from the first-person point of view. In\nthis discipline we study different forms of experience just as\nwe experience them, from the perspective of the subject living through\nor performing them. Thus, we characterize experiences of seeing,\nhearing, imagining, thinking, feeling (i.e., emotion), wishing,\ndesiring, willing, and also acting, that is, embodied volitional\nactivities of walking, talking, cooking, carpentering, etc. However,\nnot just any characterization of an experience will do.\nPhenomenological analysis of a given type of experience will feature\nthe ways in which we ourselves would experience that form of conscious\nactivity. And the leading property of our familiar types of experience\nis their intentionality, their being a consciousness of or about\nsomething, something experienced or presented or engaged in a certain\nway. How I see or conceptualize or understand the object I am dealing\nwith defines the meaning of that object in my current experience. Thus,\nphenomenology features a study of meaning, in a wide sense that\nincludes more than what is expressed in language. \n\nIn Ideas I Husserl presented phenomenology with a\ntranscendental turn. In part this means that Husserl took on the\nKantian idiom of “transcendental idealism”, looking for\nconditions of the possibility of knowledge, or of consciousness\ngenerally, and arguably turning away from any reality beyond\nphenomena. But Husserl’s transcendental turn also involved his\ndiscovery of the method of\nepoché (from the Greek skeptics’ notion of abstaining\nfrom belief). We are to practice phenomenology, Husserl proposed, by\n“bracketing” the question of the existence of the natural\nworld around us. We thereby turn our attention, in reflection, to the\nstructure of our own conscious experience. Our first key result is the\nobservation that each act of consciousness is a consciousness of\nsomething, that is, intentional, or directed toward\nsomething. Consider my visual experience wherein I see a tree across\nthe square. In phenomenological reflection, we need not concern\nourselves with whether the tree exists: my experience is of a tree\nwhether or not such a tree exists. However, we do need to concern\nourselves with how the object is meant or intended. I see a\nEucalyptus tree, not a Yucca tree; I see that object as a Eucalyptus,\nwith a certain shape, with bark stripping off, etc. Thus, bracketing\nthe tree itself, we turn our attention to my experience of the tree,\nand specifically to the content or meaning in my experience. This\ntree-as-perceived Husserl calls the noema or noematic sense of the\nexperience. \n\nPhilosophers succeeding Husserl debated the proper characterization\nof phenomenology, arguing over its results and its methods. Adolf\nReinach, an early student of Husserl’s (who died in World War I),\nargued that phenomenology should remain allied with a realist ontology,\nas in Husserl’s Logical Investigations. Roman Ingarden, a\nPolish phenomenologist of the next generation, continued the resistance\nto Husserl’s turn to transcendental idealism. For such philosophers,\nphenomenology should not bracket questions of being or ontology, as the\nmethod of epoché would suggest. And they were not\nalone. Martin Heidegger studied Husserl’s early writings, worked as\nAssistant to Husserl in 1916, and in 1928 succeeded Husserl in the\nprestigious chair at the University of Freiburg. Heidegger had his own\nideas about phenomenology. \n\nIn Being and Time (1927) Heidegger unfurled his rendition\nof phenomenology. For Heidegger, we and our activities are always “in\nthe world”, our being is being-in-the-world, so we do not study our\nactivities by bracketing the world, rather we interpret our activities\nand the meaning things have for us by looking to our contextual\nrelations to things in the world. Indeed, for Heidegger, phenomenology\nresolves into what he called “fundamental ontology”. We must\ndistinguish beings from their being, and we begin our investigation of\nthe meaning of being in our own case, examining our own existence in\nthe activity of “Dasein” (that being whose being is in each case my\nown). Heidegger resisted Husserl’s neo-Cartesian emphasis on\nconsciousness and subjectivity, including how perception presents\nthings around us. By contrast, Heidegger held that our more basic ways\nof relating to things are in practical activities like hammering, where\nthe phenomenology reveals our situation in a context of equipment and\nin being-with-others. \n\nIn Being and Time Heidegger approached phenomenology, in a\nquasi-poetic idiom, through the root meanings of “logos”\nand “phenomena”, so that phenomenology is defined as the\nart or practice of “letting things show themselves”. In\nHeidegger’s inimitable linguistic play on the Greek roots, “\n‘phenomenology’ means …—to let that which\nshows itself be seen from itself in the very way in which it shows\nitself from itself.” (See Heidegger, Being and Time,\n1927, ¦ 7C.) Here Heidegger explicitly parodies Husserl’s call,\n“To the things themselves!”, or “To the phenomena\nthemselves!” Heidegger went on to emphasize practical forms of\ncomportment or better relating (Verhalten) as in hammering a\nnail, as opposed to representational forms of intentionality as in\nseeing or thinking about a hammer. Much of Being and Time\ndevelops an existential interpretation of our modes of being\nincluding, famously, our being-toward-death. \n\nIn a very different style, in clear analytical prose, in the text of a\nlecture course called The Basic Problems of Phenomenology\n(1927), Heidegger traced the question of the meaning of being from\nAristotle through many other thinkers into the issues of\nphenomenology.  Our understanding of beings and their being comes\nultimately through phenomenology. Here the connection with classical\nissues of ontology is more apparent, and consonant with Husserl’s\nvision in the Logical Investigations (an early source of\ninspiration for Heidegger). One of Heidegger’s most innovative ideas\nwas his conception of the “ground” of being, looking to\nmodes of being more fundamental than the things around us (from trees\nto hammers). Heidegger questioned the contemporary concern with\ntechnology, and his writing might suggest that our scientific theories\nare historical artifacts that we use in technological practice, rather\nthan systems of ideal truth (as Husserl had held). Our deep\nunderstanding of being, in our own case, comes rather from\nphenomenology, Heidegger held. \n\nIn the 1930s phenomenology migrated from Austrian and then German\nphilosophy into French philosophy. The way had been paved in Marcel\nProust’s In Search of Lost Time, in which the narrator\nrecounts in close detail his vivid recollections of past experiences,\nincluding his famous associations with the smell of freshly baked\nmadeleines. This sensibility to experience traces to Descartes’ work,\nand French phenomenology has been an effort to preserve the central\nthrust of Descartes’ insights while rejecting mind-body dualism. The\nexperience of one’s own body, or one’s lived or living body, has been\nan important motif in many French philosophers of the 20th\ncentury. \n\nIn the novel Nausea (1936) Jean-Paul Sartre described a\nbizarre course of experience in which the protagonist, writing in the\nfirst person, describes how ordinary objects lose their meaning until\nhe encounters pure being at the foot of a chestnut tree, and in that\nmoment recovers his sense of his own freedom. In Being and\nNothingness (1943, written partly while a prisoner of war),\nSartre developed his conception of phenomenological\nontology. Consciousness is a consciousness of objects, as Husserl had\nstressed. In Sartre’s model of intentionality, the central player in\nconsciousness is a phenomenon, and the occurrence of a phenomenon just\nis a consciousness-of-an-object. The chestnut tree I see is, for\nSartre, such a phenomenon in my consciousness. Indeed, all things in\nthe world, as we normally experience them, are phenomena, beneath or\nbehind which lies their “being-in-itself”. Consciousness,\nby contrast, has “being-for-itself”, since each\nconsciousness is not only a consciousness-of-its-object but also a\npre-reflective consciousness-of-itself (conscience de\nsoi). Yet for Sartre, unlike Husserl, the “I” or self\nis nothing but a sequence of acts of consciousness, notably including\nradically free choices (like a Humean bundle of perceptions). \n\nFor Sartre, the practice of phenomenology proceeds by a deliberate\nreflection on the structure of consciousness. Sartre’s method is in\neffect a literary style of interpretive description of different types\nof experience in relevant situations—a practice that does not\nreally fit the methodological proposals of either Husserl or Heidegger,\nbut makes use of Sartre’s great literary skill. (Sartre wrote many\nplays and novels and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.) \n\nSartre’s phenomenology in Being and Nothingness became the\nphilosophical foundation for his popular philosophy of existentialism,\nsketched in his famous lecture “Existentialism is a\nHumanism” (1945).  In Being and Nothingness Sartre\nemphasized the experience of freedom of choice, especially the project\nof choosing one’s self, the defining pattern of one’s past\nactions. Through vivid description of the “look” of the\nOther, Sartre laid groundwork for the contemporary political\nsignificance of the concept of the Other (as in other groups or\nethnicities). Indeed, in The Second Sex (1949) Simone de\nBeauvoir, Sartre’s life-long companion, launched contemporary feminism\nwith her nuanced account of the perceived role of women as Other. \n\nIn 1940s Paris, Maurice Merleau-Ponty joined with Sartre and\nBeauvoir in developing phenomenology. In Phenomenology of\nPerception (1945) Merleau-Ponty developed a rich variety of\nphenomenology emphasizing the role of the body in human experience.\nUnlike Husserl, Heidegger, and Sartre, Merleau-Ponty looked to\nexperimental psychology, analyzing the reported experience of amputees\nwho felt sensations in a phantom limb. Merleau-Ponty rejected both\nassociationist psychology, focused on correlations between sensation\nand stimulus, and intellectualist psychology, focused on rational\nconstruction of the world in the mind. (Think of the behaviorist and\ncomputationalist models of mind in more recent decades of empirical\npsychology.) Instead, Merleau-Ponty focused on the “body image”, our\nexperience of our own body and its significance in our activities.\nExtending Husserl’s account of the lived body (as opposed to the\nphysical body), Merleau-Ponty resisted the traditional Cartesian\nseparation of mind and body. For the body image is neither in the\nmental realm nor in the mechanical-physical realm. Rather, my body is,\nas it were, me in my engaged action with things I perceive including\nother people. \n\nThe scope of Phenomenology of Perception is characteristic\nof the breadth of classical phenomenology, not least because\nMerleau-Ponty drew (with generosity) on Husserl, Heidegger, and Sartre\nwhile fashioning his own innovative vision of phenomenology. His\nphenomenology addressed the role of attention in the phenomenal field,\nthe experience of the body, the spatiality of the body, the motility of\nthe body, the body in sexual being and in speech, other selves,\ntemporality, and the character of freedom so important in French\nexistentialism. Near the end of a chapter on the cogito (Descartes’ “I\nthink, therefore I am”), Merleau-Ponty succinctly captures his\nembodied, existential form of phenomenology, writing: \n\nIn short, consciousness is embodied (in the world), and equally body\nis infused with consciousness (with cognition of the world). \n\nIn the years since Husserl, Heidegger, et al. wrote,\nphenomenologists have dug into all these classical issues, including\nintentionality, temporal awareness, intersubjectivity, practical\nintentionality, and the social and linguistic contexts of human\nactivity. Interpretation of historical texts by Husserl et al.\nhas played a prominent role in this work, both because the texts are\nrich and difficult and because the historical dimension is itself part\nof the practice of continental European philosophy. Since the 1960s,\nphilosophers trained in the methods of analytic philosophy have also\ndug into the foundations of phenomenology, with an eye to\n20th century work in philosophy of logic, language, and\nmind. \n\nPhenomenology was already linked with logical and semantic theory in\nHusserl’s Logical Investigations. Analytic phenomenology\npicks up on that connection. In particular, Dagfinn Føllesdal\nand J.  N. Mohanty have explored historical and conceptual relations\nbetween Husserl’s phenomenology and Frege’s logical semantics (in\nFrege’s “On Sense and Reference”, 1892). For Frege, an\nexpression refers to an object by way of a sense: thus, two\nexpressions (say, “the morning star” and “the\nevening star”) may refer to the same object (Venus) but express\ndifferent senses with different manners of presentation. For Husserl,\nsimilarly, an experience (or act of consciousness) intends or refers\nto an object by way of a noema or noematic sense: thus, two\nexperiences may refer to the same object but have different noematic\nsenses involving different ways of presenting the object (for example,\nin seeing the same object from different sides). Indeed, for Husserl,\nthe theory of intentionality is a generalization of the theory of\nlinguistic reference: as linguistic reference is mediated by sense, so\nintentional reference is mediated by noematic sense. \n\nMore recently, analytic philosophers of mind have rediscovered\nphenomenological issues of mental representation, intentionality,\nconsciousness, sensory experience, intentional content, and\ncontext-of-thought. Some of these analytic philosophers of mind hark\nback to William James and Franz Brentano at the origins of modern\npsychology, and some look to empirical research in today’s cognitive\nneuroscience. Some researchers have begun to combine phenomenological\nissues with issues of neuroscience and behavioral studies and\nmathematical modeling. Such studies will extend the methods of\ntraditional phenomenology as the Zeitgeist moves on. We\naddress philosophy of mind below. \n\nThe discipline of phenomenology forms one basic field in philosophy\namong others. How is phenomenology distinguished from, and related to,\nother fields in philosophy? \n\nTraditionally, philosophy includes at least four core fields or\ndisciplines: ontology, epistemology, ethics, logic. Suppose\nphenomenology joins that list. Consider then these elementary\ndefinitions of field: \n\nThe domains of study in these five fields are clearly different, and\nthey seem to call for different methods of study. \n\nPhilosophers have sometimes argued that one of these fields is\n“first philosophy”, the most fundamental discipline, on which all\nphilosophy or all knowledge or wisdom rests. Historically (it may be\nargued), Socrates and Plato put ethics first, then Aristotle put\nmetaphysics or ontology first, then Descartes put epistemology first,\nthen Russell put logic first, and then Husserl (in his later\ntranscendental phase) put phenomenology first. \n\nConsider epistemology. As we saw, phenomenology helps to define the\nphenomena on which knowledge claims rest, according to modern\nepistemology. On the other hand, phenomenology itself claims to achieve\nknowledge about the nature of consciousness, a distinctive kind of\nfirst-person knowledge, through a form of intuition. \n\nConsider logic. As we saw, logical theory of meaning led Husserl\ninto the theory of intentionality, the heart of phenomenology. On one\naccount, phenomenology explicates the intentional or semantic force of\nideal meanings, and propositional meanings are central to logical\ntheory. But logical structure is expressed in language, either ordinary\nlanguage or symbolic languages like those of predicate logic or\nmathematics or computer systems. It remains an important issue of\ndebate where and whether language shapes specific forms of experience\n(thought, perception, emotion) and their content or meaning. So there\nis an important (if disputed) relation between phenomenology and\nlogico-linguistic theory, especially philosophical logic and philosophy\nof language (as opposed to mathematical logic per se). \n\nConsider ontology. Phenomenology studies (among other things) the\nnature of consciousness, which is a central issue in metaphysics or\nontology, and one that leads into the traditional mind-body problem.\nHusserlian methodology would bracket the question of the existence of\nthe surrounding world, thereby separating phenomenology from the\nontology of the world. Yet Husserl’s phenomenology presupposes theory\nabout species and individuals (universals and particulars), relations\nof part and whole, and ideal meanings—all parts of\nontology. \n\nNow consider ethics. Phenomenology might play a role in ethics by\noffering analyses of the structure of will, valuing, happiness, and\ncare for others (in empathy and sympathy). Historically, though,\nethics has been on the horizon of phenomenology. Husserl largely\navoided ethics in his major works, though he featured the role of\npractical concerns in the structure of the life-world or\nof Geist (spirit, or culture, as in Zeitgeist), and\nhe once delivered a course of lectures giving ethics (like logic) a\nbasic place in philosophy, indicating the importance of the\nphenomenology of sympathy in grounding ethics. In Being and\nTime Heidegger claimed not to pursue ethics while discussing\nphenomena ranging from care, conscience, and guilt to\n“fallenness” and “authenticity” (all phenomena\nwith theological echoes). In Being and Nothingness Sartre\nanalyzed with subtlety the logical problem of “bad faith”,\nyet he developed an ontology of value as produced by willing in good\nfaith (which sounds like a revised Kantian foundation for\nmorality). Beauvoir sketched an existentialist ethics, and Sartre left\nunpublished notebooks on ethics. However, an explicitly\nphenomenological approach to ethics emerged in the works of Emannuel\nLevinas, a Lithuanian phenomenologist who heard Husserl and Heidegger\nin Freiburg before moving to Paris. In Totality and Infinity\n(1961), modifying themes drawn from Husserl and Heidegger, Levinas\nfocused on the significance of the “face” of the other,\nexplicitly developing grounds for ethics in this range of\nphenomenology, writing an impressionistic style of prose with\nallusions to religious experience. \n\nAllied with ethics are political and social philosophy. Sartre and\nMerleau-Ponty were politically engaged in 1940s Paris, and their\nexistential philosophies (phenomenologically based) suggest a\npolitical theory based in individual freedom. Sartre later sought an\nexplicit blend of existentialism with Marxism. Still, political theory\nhas remained on the borders of phenomenology. Social theory, however,\nhas been closer to phenomenology as such. Husserl analyzed the\nphenomenological structure of the life-world and Geist\ngenerally, including our role in social activity. Heidegger stressed\nsocial practice, which he found more primordial than individual\nconsciousness. Alfred Schutz developed a phenomenology of the social\nworld. Sartre continued the phenomenological appraisal of the meaning\nof the other, the fundamental social formation. Moving outward from\nphenomenological issues, Michel Foucault studied the genesis and\nmeaning of social institutions, from prisons to insane asylums. And\nJacques Derrida has long practiced a kind of phenomenology of\nlanguage, seeking social meaning in the “deconstruction”\nof wide-ranging texts.  Aspects of French\n“poststructuralist” theory are sometimes interpreted as\nbroadly phenomenological, but such issues are beyond the present\npurview. \n\nClassical phenomenology, then, ties into certain areas of\nepistemology, logic, and ontology, and leads into parts of ethical,\nsocial, and political theory. \n\nIt ought to be obvious that phenomenology has a lot to say in the\narea called philosophy of mind. Yet the traditions of phenomenology and\nanalytic philosophy of mind have not been closely joined, despite\noverlapping areas of interest. So it is appropriate to close this\nsurvey of phenomenology by addressing philosophy of mind, one of the\nmost vigorously debated areas in recent philosophy. \n\nThe tradition of analytic philosophy began, early in the 20th\ncentury, with analyses of language, notably in the works of Gottlob\nFrege, Bertrand Russell, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Then in The Concept\nof Mind (1949) Gilbert Ryle developed a series of analyses of language\nabout different mental states, including sensation, belief, and will.\nThough Ryle is commonly deemed a philosopher of ordinary language, Ryle\nhimself said The Concept of Mind could be called phenomenology. In\neffect, Ryle analyzed our phenomenological understanding of mental\nstates as reflected in ordinary language about the mind. From this\nlinguistic phenomenology Ryle argued that Cartesian mind-body dualism\ninvolves a category mistake (the logic or grammar of mental \nverbs—“believe”, “see”, etc.—does not\nmean that we ascribe belief, sensation, etc., to “the ghost in\nthe machine”). With Ryle’s rejection of mind-body dualism, the\nmind-body problem was re-awakened: what is the ontology of mind\nvis-à-vis body, and how are mind and body related? \n\nRené Descartes, in his epoch-making Meditations on First\nPhilosophy (1641), had argued that minds and bodies are two distinct\nkinds of being or substance with two distinct kinds of attributes or\nmodes: bodies are characterized by spatiotemporal physical properties,\nwhile minds are characterized by properties of thinking (including\nseeing, feeling, etc.). Centuries later, phenomenology would find, with\nBrentano and Husserl, that mental acts are characterized by\nconsciousness and intentionality, while natural science would find that\nphysical systems are characterized by mass and force, ultimately by\ngravitational, electromagnetic, and quantum fields. Where do we find\nconsciousness and intentionality in the\nquantum-electromagnetic-gravitational field that, by hypothesis, orders\neverything in the natural world in which we humans and our minds exist?\nThat is the mind-body problem today. In short, phenomenology by any\nother name lies at the heart of the contemporary mind-body problem. \n\nAfter Ryle, philosophers sought a more explicit and generally\nnaturalistic ontology of mind. In the 1950s materialism was argued\nanew, urging that mental states are identical with states of the\ncentral nervous system. The classical identity theory holds that each\ntoken mental state (in a particular person’s mind at a particular time)\nis identical with a token brain state (in that person’s brain at that\ntime). A stronger materialism holds, instead, that each type of mental\nstate is identical with a type of brain state. But materialism does not\nfit comfortably with phenomenology. For it is not obvious how conscious\nmental states as we experience them—sensations, thoughts,\nemotions—can simply be the complex neural states that somehow\nsubserve or implement them. If mental states and neural states are\nsimply identical, in token or in type, where in our scientific theory\nof mind does the phenomenology occur—is it not simply replaced\nby neuroscience? And yet experience is part of what is to be explained\nby neuroscience. \n\nIn the late 1960s and 1970s the computer model of mind set in, and\nfunctionalism became the dominant model of mind. On this model, mind is\nnot what the brain consists in (electrochemical transactions in neurons\nin vast complexes). Instead, mind is what brains do: their function of\nmediating between information coming into the organism and behavior\nproceeding from the organism. Thus, a mental state is a functional\nstate of the brain or of the human (or animal) organism. More\nspecifically, on a favorite variation of functionalism, the mind is a\ncomputing system: mind is to brain as software is to hardware; thoughts\nare just programs running on the brain’s “wetware”. Since\nthe 1970s the cognitive sciences—from experimental studies of\ncognition to neuroscience—have tended toward a mix of\nmaterialism and functionalism. Gradually, however, philosophers found\nthat phenomenological aspects of the mind pose problems for the\nfunctionalist paradigm too. \n\nIn the early 1970s Thomas Nagel argued in “What Is It Like to\nBe a Bat?” (1974) that consciousness itself—especially\nthe subjective character of what it is like to have a certain type of\nexperience—escapes physical theory. Many philosophers pressed\nthe case that sensory qualia—what it is like to feel pain, to\nsee red, etc.—are not addressed or explained by a physical\naccount of either brain structure or brain function. Consciousness has\nproperties of its own. And yet, we know, it is closely tied to the\nbrain. And, at some level of description, neural activities implement\ncomputation. \n\nIn the 1980s John Searle argued in Intentionality (1983) (and\nfurther in The Rediscovery of the Mind (1991)) that intentionality and\nconsciousness are essential properties of mental states. For Searle,\nour brains produce mental states with properties of consciousness and\nintentionality, and this is all part of our biology, yet consciousness\nand intentionality require a “first-person” ontology.\nSearle also argued that computers simulate but do not have mental\nstates characterized by intentionality. As Searle argued, a computer\nsystem has a syntax (processing symbols of certain shapes) but has no\nsemantics (the symbols lack meaning: we interpret the symbols). In this\nway Searle rejected both materialism and functionalism, while insisting\nthat mind is a biological property of organisms like us: our brains\n“secrete” consciousness. \n\nThe analysis of consciousness and intentionality is central to\nphenomenology as appraised above, and Searle’s theory of intentionality\nreads like a modernized version of Husserl’s. (Contemporary logical\ntheory takes the form of stating truth conditions for propositions, and\nSearle characterizes a mental state’s intentionality by specifying its\n“satisfaction conditions”). However, there is an important\ndifference in background theory. For Searle explicitly assumes the\nbasic worldview of natural science, holding that consciousness is part\nof nature. But Husserl explicitly brackets that assumption, and later\nphenomenologists—including Heidegger, Sartre, \nMerleau-Ponty—seem to seek a certain sanctuary for phenomenology beyond the\nnatural sciences. And yet phenomenology itself should be largely\nneutral about further theories of how experience arises, notably from\nbrain activity. \n\nSince the late 1980s, and especially the late 1990s, a variety of\nwriters working in philosophy of mind have focused on the fundamental\ncharacter of consciousness, ultimately a phenomenological issue. Does\nconsciousness always and essentially involve self-consciousness, or\nconsciousness-of-consciousness, as Brentano, Husserl, and Sartre held\n(in varying detail)? If so, then every act of consciousness either\nincludes or is adjoined by a consciousness-of-that-consciousness. Does\nthat self-consciousness take the form of an internal self-monitoring?\nIf so, is that monitoring of a higher order, where each act of\nconsciousness is joined by a further mental act monitoring the base\nact? Or is such monitoring of the same order as the base act, a proper\npart of the act without which the act would not be conscious? A variety\nof models of this self-consciousness have been developed, some\nexplicitly drawing on or adapting views in Brentano, Husserl, and\nSartre. Two recent collections address these issues: David Woodruff\nSmith and Amie L. Thomasson (editors), Phenomenology and Philosophy of\nMind (2005), and Uriah Kriegel and Kenneth Williford (editors),\nSelf-Representational Approaches to Consciousness (2006). \n\nThe philosophy of mind may be factored into the following\ndisciplines or ranges of theory relevant to mind: \n\nThis division of labor in the theory of mind can be seen as an\nextension of Brentano’s original distinction between descriptive and\ngenetic psychology. Phenomenology offers descriptive analyses of mental\nphenomena, while neuroscience (and wider biology and ultimately\nphysics) offers models of explanation of what causes or gives rise to\nmental phenomena. Cultural theory offers analyses of social activities\nand their impact on experience, including ways language shapes our\nthought, emotion, and motivation. And ontology frames all these results\nwithin a basic scheme of the structure of the world, including our own\nminds. \n\nThe ontological distinction among the form, appearance, and substrate\nof an activity of consciousness is detailed in D. W. Smith, Mind World\n(2004), in the essay “Three Facets of Consciousness”. \n\nMeanwhile, from an epistemological standpoint, all these ranges of\ntheory about mind begin with how we observe and reason about and seek\nto explain phenomena we encounter in the world. And that is where\nphenomenology begins. Moreover, how we understand each piece of\ntheory, including theory about mind, is central to the theory of\nintentionality, as it were, the semantics of thought and experience in\ngeneral. And that is the heart of phenomenology. \n\nPhenomenological issues, by any other name, have played a prominent\nrole in very recent philosophy of mind. Amplifying the theme of the\nprevious section, we note two such issues: the form of inner awareness\nthat ostensibly makes a mental activity conscious, and the phenomenal\ncharacter of conscious cognitive mental activity in thought, and\nperception, and action. \n\nEver since Nagel’s 1974 article, “What Is It Like to be a Bat?”, the\nnotion of what-it-is-like to experience a mental state or activity has\nposed a challenge to reductive materialism and functionalism in theory\nof mind. This subjective phenomenal character of consciousness is held\nto be constitutive or definitive of consciousness. What is the form of\nthat phenomenal character we find in consciousness? \n\nA prominent line of analysis holds that the phenomenal character of\na mental activity consists in a certain form of awareness of that\nactivity, an awareness that by definition renders it conscious. Since\nthe 1980s a variety of models of that awareness have been developed. As\nnoted above, there are models that define this awareness as a\nhigher-order monitoring, either an inner perception of the activity (a\nform of inner sense per Kant) or inner consciousness (per Brentano), or\nan inner thought about the activity. A further model analyzes such\nawareness as an integral part of the experience, a form of\nself-representation within the experience. (Again, see Kriegel and\nWilliford (eds.) (2006).) \n\nA somewhat different model comes arguably closer to the form of\nself-consciousness sought by Brentano, Husserl, and Sartre. On the\n“modal” model, inner awareness of an experience takes the form of an\nintegral reflexive awareness of “this very experience”. That form of\nawareness is held to be a constitutive element of the experience that\nrenders it conscious. As Sartre put the claim, self-consciousness is\nconstitutive of consciousness, but that self-consciousness is\n“pre-reflective”. This reflexive awareness is not, then, part of a\nseparable higher-order monitoring, but rather built into consciousness\nper se. On the modal model, this awareness is part of the way the\nexperience unfolds: subjectively, phenomenally, consciously. This model\nis elaborated in D. W. Smith (2004), Mind World, in the essay “Return\nto Consciousness” (and elsewhere). \n\nWhatever may be the precise form of phenomenal character, we would\nask how that character distributes over mental life. What is phenomenal\nin different types of mental activity? Here arise issues of cognitive\nphenomenology. Is phenomenality restricted to the “feel” of sensory\nexperience? Or is phenomenality present also in cognitive experiences of\nthinking such-and-such, or of perception bearing conceptual as well as\nsensory content, or also in volitional or conative bodily action? These\nissues are explored in Bayne and Montague (eds.) (2011), Cognitive\nPhenomenology. \n\nA restrictive view holds that only sensory experience has a proper\nphenomenal character, a what-it-is-like. Seeing a color, hearing a\ntone, smelling an odor, feeling a pain—these types of\nconscious experience have a phenomenal character, but no others do, on\nthis view.  A stringent empiricism might limit phenomenal experience\nto pure sensations, though Hume himself presumably recognized\nphenomenal “ideas” beyond pure sense\n“impressions”. A somewhat more expansive view would hold\nthat perceptual experience has a distinctive phenomenal character even\nwhere sensation is informed by concepts. Seeing that yellow canary,\nhearing that clear Middle C on a Steinway piano, smelling the sharp\nodor of anise, feeling a pain of the jab of the doctor’s needle in\nreceiving an injection—these types of conscious experience\nhave a character of what-it-is-like, a character informed by\nconceptual content that is also “felt”, on this view. A\nKantian account of conceptual-sensory experience, or\n“intuition”, would endorse a phenomenal character in these\ntypes of experience. Indeed, “phenomena”, in the Kantian\nidiom, are precisely things as they appear in consciousness, so of\ncourse their appearance has a phenomenal character. \n\nNow, a much more expansive view would hold that every conscious\nexperience has a distinctive phenomenal character. Thinking that 17 is\na prime number, thinking that the red in the sunset is caused by the\nsun’s light waves being bent by the atmosphere, thinking that Kant was\nmore right than Hume about the grounds of knowledge, thinking that\neconomic principles are also political—even such highly\ncognitive activities have a character of what-it-is-like to so think,\naccording to this expansive view. \n\nClassical phenomenologists like Husserl and Merleau-Ponty surely\nassumed an expansive view of phenomenal consciousness. As noted above,\nthe “phenomena” that are the focus of phenomenology were\nassumed to present a rich character of lived experience. Even\nHeidegger, while de-emphasizing consciousness (the Cartesian sin!),\ndwelt on “phenomena” as what appears or shows up to us (to\n“Dasein”) in our everyday activities such as hammering a\nnail. Like Merleau-Ponty, Gurwitsch (1964) explicitly studies the\n“phenomenal field”, embracing all that is presented in our\nexperience. Arguably, for these thinkers, every type of conscious\nexperience has its distinctive phenomenal character, its\n“phenomenology”—and the task of phenomenology (the\ndiscipline) is to analyze that character. Note that in recent debates\nthe phenomenal character of an experience is often called its\n“phenomenology”—whereas, in the established idiom,\nthe term “phenomenology” names the discipline that studies\nsuch “phenomenology”. \n\nSince intentionality is a crucial property of consciousness,\naccording to Brentano, Husserl, et al., the character of intentionality\nitself would count as phenomenal, as part of what-it-is-like to\nexperience a given type of intentional experience. But it is not only\nintentional perception and thought that have their distinctive\nphenomenal characters. Embodied action also would have a distinctive\nphenomenal character, involving “lived” characters of kinesthetic\nsensation as well as conceptual volitional content, say, in the feel of\nkicking a soccer ball. The “lived body” is precisely the body as\nexperienced in everyday embodied volitional action such as running or\nkicking a ball or even speaking. Husserl wrote at length about the\n“lived body” (Leib), in Ideas II, and Merleau-Ponty followed suit with\nrich analyses of embodied perception and action, in Phenomenology of\nPerception. In Bayne and Montague (eds.) (2011) see the article on\nconative phenomenology by Terence Horgan, and in Smith and Thomasson\n(eds.) (2005) see articles by Charles Siewert and Sean Kelly. \n\nBut now a problems remains. Intentionality essentially involves\nmeaning, so the question arises how meaning appears in phenomenal\ncharacter. Importantly, the content of a conscious experience typically\ncarries a horizon of background meaning, meaning that is largely\nimplicit rather than explicit in experience. But then a wide range of\ncontent carried by an experience would not have a consciously felt\nphenomenal character. So it may well be argued. Here is a line of\nphenomenological theory for another day."}]
