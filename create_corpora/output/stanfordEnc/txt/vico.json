He was trained in\njurisprudence, but read widely in Classics, philology, and philosophy,\nall of which informed his highly original views on history,\nhistoriography, and culture. His thought is most fully expressed in his\nmature work, the Scienza Nuova or The New Science.\nIn his own time, Vico was relatively unknown, but from the nineteenth\ncentury onwards his views found a wider audience and today his\ninfluence is widespread in the humanities and social sciences. \n\n\n\nGiovanni Battista Vico was born in Naples, Italy, June 23 1668, to a\nbookseller and daughter of a carriage maker. He received his formal\neducation at local grammar schools, from various Jesuit tutors, and at\nthe University of Naples from which he graduated in 1694 as Doctor of\nCivil and Canon Law. As he reports in his autobiography (Vita di\nGiambattista Vico), however, Vico considered himself as “teacher\nof himself,”[1]\n a habit he developed under the direction of\nhis father, after a fall at the age of 7 caused a three year absence\nfrom school. Vico reports that “as a result of this mischance he grew\nup with a melancholy and irritable temperament such as belongs to men\nof ingenuity and depth” (Vita, 111). Vico left Naples in 1686 for\nVatolla where, with occasional returns to his home city, he remained\nfor the next nine years as tutor to the sons of Domenico Rocca. Vico\nreturned to Naples in 1695 and four years later married Teresa Caterina\nDestito with whom he had eight children. Of his surviving children\n(three of them died), his younger son Gennaro was a favorite and went\non to an academic career; his daughter Lusia achieved success as a\nsinger and minor poet, and Ignazio is known to have been a source of\ndisappointment to him. Of the others (Angela Teresa and Filippo)\nlittle is known. Vico was never rich, though he made a living, and the\nlegend of his poverty derives from Villarosa’s embellishment of the\nautobiography.  He did, however, suffer bouts of ill-health, and\nfailed in his life-long ambition of succeeding to the chair of\nJurisprudence at the University of Naples, having to settle instead\nfor a lower and poorly paid professorship in Rhetoric. He retained\nthis position until 1741 at which time he was succeeded by his son\nGennaro. Vico died in Naples on January 22–23, 1744, aged 75. \n\nIn his own time Vico’s work was largely neglected and generally\nmisunderstood-he describes himself living as a “stranger”\nand “quite unknown” in his native city (Vita, 134)-and it\nwas not until the nineteenth century that his thought began to make a\nsignificant impression on the philosophical world. However, Vico’s\nthought never suffered from complete obscurity and its influence can\nbe discerned in various traditions of European thought from the\nmid-eighteenth century\n onwards.[2]\n In Italy, Vico’s impact on aesthetic and\nliterary criticism is evident in the writings of Francesco De Sanctis\nand Benedetto Croce, and in jurisprudence, economics, and political\ntheory, his influence can be traced from Antonio Genovesi (one of\nVico’s own pupils), Ferdinando Galiani, and Gaetano Filangieri. In\nGermany, Vico’s ideas were known to Johann-George Hamman and, via his\ndisciple J.G. von Herder, to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich\nHeinrich Jacobi. Vico’s ideas were sufficiently familiar to Friedrich\nAugust Wolf to inspire his article “G.B. Vico on Homer.” In France,\nVico’s thought was likely known to Charles de Secondat, baron de\nMontesquieu, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and some have seen his\ninfluence in the writings of Denis Diderot, Etienne Bonnot, abbé\nde Condillac, and Joseph Marie, comte de Maistre. In Great Britain,\nalthough Vichian themes are intimated in the philosophical writings of\nthe Empiricists and thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment, there is no\ndirect evidence that they knew of his writings. The earliest known\ndisseminator of Vico’s views in the English-speaking world is Samuel\nTaylor Coleridge, who was responsible for much of the interest in Vico\nin the second half of the nineteenth century. \n\nVico’s ideas reached a wider audience with a German translation of\nThe New Science by W.E. Weber which appeared in 1822, and,\nmore significantly, through a French version by Jules Michelet in 1824,\nwhich was reissued in 1835. Michelet’s translation was widely read and\nwas responsible for a new appreciation of Vico’s work in France.\nSubsequently, Vico’s views impacted the work of Wilhelm Dilthey, Karl\nMarx, R.G. Collingwood, and James Joyce, who used The New\nScience to structure Finnegans Wake. Twentieth century\nscholarship has established illuminating comparisons with the tradition\nof Hegelian idealism, and taken up the relationship between Vico’s\nthought and that of philosophers in the western tradition and beyond,\nincluding Plato, Aristotle, Ibn Khaldun, Thomas Hobbes, Benedict de\nSpinoza, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, and Friedrich Nietzsche.\nComparisons and connections have also been drawn between Vichean themes\nand the work of various modern and contemporary thinkers, inter\nalia W.B. Yeats, Friedrich Froebel, Max Horkheimer, Walter\nBenjamin, Martin Heidegger, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Jürgen Habermas,\nPaul Ricoeur, Jean-Francois Lyotard, and Alisdair MacIntyre. As a\nreview of recent and current literature demonstrates, an appreciation\nof Vico’s thought has spread far beyond philosophy, and his ideas have\nbeen taken up by scholars within a range of contemporary disciplines,\nincluding anthropology, cultural theory, education, hermeneutics,\nhistory, literary criticism, psychology, and sociology. Thus despite\nobscure beginnings, Vico is now widely regarded as a highly original\nthinker who anticipated central currents in later philosophy and the\nhuman sciences.\n \n\nVico’s earliest publications were in poetry rather than philosophy-the\nLucretian poem “Affetti di un disperato” (“The\nFeelings of One in Despair”) (composed in 1692) and\n“Canzone in morte di Antonio Carafa” (“Ode on the\nDeath of Antonio Carafa”) both published in 1693. After his\nappointment to Professor of Rhetoric in 1699, Vico began to address\nphilosophical themes in the first of six Orazioni Inaugurali\n(Inaugural Orations). In 1707 Vico gave a seventh\noration-intended as an augmentation of the philosophy of Bacon that he\nsubsequently revised and published in 1709 under the title De\nnostri temporis studiorum ratione (On the Study Methods of\nOur Time). Two years later his projected but uncompleted\nstatement on metaphysics appeared, De antiquissima Italorum\nsapientia ex linguae latinae originibus eruenda libri tres\n(On the Most Ancient Wisdom of the Italians Unearthed from the\nOrigins of the Latin Language).  The years that followed saw the\npublication of various works, including two replies to critical\nreviews of De antiquissima (1711 and 1712), a work of royal\nhistoriography-De rebus gestis Antonii Caraphaei libri\nquattuor (The Life of Antonio Caraffa) (1716)-Il\ndiritto universale (Universal Right) (1720–22), and in\n1725 and 1731 the two parts of his autobiography which together\ncompose the Vita di Giambattista Vico scritta da se medesimo\n(Life of Giambattista Vico Written by Himself).  Over the\ncourse of his professional career, Vico also composed and delivered\nlectures on rhetoric to students preparing to enter into the study of\njurisprudence. These survive as student transcriptions or copies of\nthe original lectures, and are collected under the title\nInstitutiones Oratoriae (1711–1741) (translated as The Art\nof Rhetoric) in which Vico’s develops his views on rhetoric or\neloquence, “the faculty of speaking appropriate to the purpose of\npersuading” through which the orator aims to “bend the spirit by his\nspeech.”[3] \n\nAlthough these early writings are increasingly studied as\nsignificant works in their right, they have generally been regarded as\nimportant for tracing the development of various themes and ideas which\nVico came to refine and express fully in his major and influential\nwork, The New Science. In De nostri temporis studiorum\nratione, for example, Vico takes up the theme of modernity and\nraises the question of “which study method is finer or better, ours or\nthe Ancients?” and illustrates “by examples the advantages and\ndrawbacks of the respective\n methods.”[4]\n Vico observes that the Moderns are equipped with the\n“instruments” of “philosophical\n‘critique’” and “analytic geometry”\n(especially in the form of Cartesian logic) (DN, 7–9), and that these\nopen realms of natural scientific inquiry (chemistry, pharmacology,\nastronomy, geographical exploration, and mechanics) and artistic\nproduction (realism in poetry, oratory, and sculpture) which were\nunknown and unavailable to the Ancients (DN, 11–12). Although these\nbring significant benefits, Vico argues, modern education suffers\nunnecessarily from ignoring the\nars topica (art of topics) which encourage the use of\nimagination and memory in organizing speech into eloquent persuasion.\nThe result, Vico argues, is an undue attention to the “geometrical\nmethod” modeled on the discipline of physics (DN, 21ff.), and an\nemphasis on abstract philosophical criticism over poetry. This\nundermines the importance of exposition, persuasion, and pleasure in\nlearning; it “benumbs...[the] imagination and stupefies...[the] memory”\n(DN, 42), both of which are central to learning, complex reasoning, and\nthe discovery of truth. Combining the methods of both Ancients and\nModerns, Vico argues that education should aim ideally at cultivating\nthe “total life of the body politic” (DN, 36): students “should be\ntaught the totality of the sciences and arts, and their intellectual\npowers should be developed to the full” so that they “would become\nexact in science, clever in practical matters, fluent in eloquence,\nimaginative in understanding poetry or painting, and strong in\nmemorizing what they have learned in their legal studies” (DN, 19). \n\nThis defense of humanistic education is expanded in the\nOrations, directed “to the flower and stock of well-born young\nmanhood,”[5]\n where Vico makes a case for modern\nhumanistic education and focuses on a certain kind of “practical\nwisdom” or prudentia which the human mind, with the\nappropriate discipline and diligence, is able to attain. This theme is\ncontinued in De Antiquissima, where Vico traces the\nconsequences of his insight that language can be treated as a source of\nhistorical knowledge. Many words of the Latin language, Vico observes,\nappear to be “derived from some inward learning rather than from the\nvernacular usage of the\n people.”[6]\n Treated as a repository\nof the past, Latin might be investigated as a way of “seek[ing] out the\nancient wisdom of the Italians from the very wisdom of their\nwords.”(DA, 40). \n\nIn the course of pursuing this task, Vico also develops two central\nthemes of his mature philosophy: the outlines of a philosophical system\nin contrast to the then dominant philosophy of Descartes already\ncriticized in De nostri temporis studiorum ratione, and his\nstatement of the principle that verum et factum convertuntur,\nthat “the true and the made are...convertible,” or that “the true is\nprecisely what is made” (verum esse ipsum factum). Vico\nemphasizes that science should be conceived as the “genus or mode by\nwhich a thing is made” so that human science in general is a matter of\ndissecting the “anatomy of nature’s works” (DA, 48), albeit through the\n“vice” of human beings that they are limited to “abstraction” as\nopposed to the power of “construction” which is found in God alone (DA,\n50–52). Given that “the norm of the truth is to have made it” (DA, 52),\nVico reasons, Descartes’ famous first principle that clear and distinct\nideas are the source of truth must be rejected: “For the mind does not\nmake itself as it gets to know itself,” Vico observes, “and since it\ndoes not make itself, it does not know the genus or mode by which it\nmakes itself” (DA, 52). Thus the truths of morality, natural science,\nand mathematics do not require “metaphysical justification” as the\nCartesians held, but demand an analysis of the causes-the\n“activity”-through which things are made (DA, 64). \n\nVico’s Vita di Giambattista Vico is of particular interest,\nnot only as a source of insight into the influences on his intellectual\ndevelopment, but as one of the earliest and most sophisticated examples\nof philosophical autobiography. Vico composed the work in response (and\nindeed the only response) to a proposal published by Count Gian Artico\ndi Porcía to Italian scholars to write their biographies for the\nedification of students. Referring to himself in the third person, Vico\nrecords the course of his life and the influence of various thinkers\nwhich led him to develop the concepts central to his mature work.\nVico reports on the importance of reading Plato, Aristotle, the\nHellenics, Scotus, Suarez, and the Classical poets, and traces his\ngrowing interest in jurisprudence and the Latin language (Vita, 116ff.\npassim). Vico describes how he came to “meditate a principle of the\nnatural law, which should be apt for the explanation of the origins of\nRoman law and every other gentile civil law in respect of history”\n(Vita, 119) and how he discovered that “an ideal eternal law...should\nbe observed in a universal city after the idea or design of providence”\n(Vita, 122). According to Vico’s own account, his studies culminated in\na distinction between ideas and languages. The first, he says,\n“discovers new historical principles of geography and chronology, the\ntwo ideas of history, and thence the principles of universal history\nlacking hitherto” (Vita, 167), while the latter “discovers new\nprinciples of poetry, both of song and verse, and shows that both it\nand they sprang up by the same natural necessity in all the first\nnations” (Vita, 168). Taken together, these form the central doctrine of\nThe New Science, namely, that there is a “philosophy and\nphilology of the human race” which produces “an ideal eternal history\nbased on the idea of...providence...[and] traversed in time by all the\nparticular histories of the nations, each with its rise, development,\nacme, decline and fall” (Vita, 169). \n\nMany themes of these early works-language, wisdom, history, truth,\ncausality, philology, rhetoric, philosophy, poetry, and the relative\nstrengths and weaknesses of ancient and modern learning-are\nincorporated into and receive their fullest treatment in Vico’s major\nwork, The New Science, first published in 1725 (an edition\nsubsequently known as the Scienza Nuova Prima or First\nNew Science) and again in a second and largely rewritten version\nfive years later. Vico published a third edition in 1744, which was\nlater edited by Fausto Nicolini and appeared in 1928. Nicoloni is\nresponsible for updating Vico’s punctuation and breaking the work up\ninto its current structure of chapters, sections, and numbered\nparagraphs (1112 in all), not originally supplied by Vico himself,\nwhich have been reproduced in many though not all subsequent\neditions. Nicolini referred to his edition as the Scienza Nuova\nseconda-Second New Science (or simply The New\nScience), under which title the definitive version is known\ntoday.  \n\nThe text consists of an overview (“Idea of the Work”)\ncouched as an explication of a frontispiece depicting a female figure\n(Metaphysics), standing on a globe of the Earth and contemplating a\nluminous triangle containing the eye of God, or Providence. Below\nstands a statue of Homer representing the origins of human society in\n“poetic wisdom.” This is followed by five Books and a\nConclusion, the first of which (“Establishment of\nPrinciples”) establishes the method upon which Vico constructs a\nhistory of civil society from its earliest beginnings in the state of\nnature (stato di natura) to its contemporary manifestation in\nseventeenth century Europe. \n\nIn the work, Vico consciously develops his notion of\nscienza (science or knowledge) in opposition to the then\ndominant philosophy of Descartes with its emphasis on clear and\ndistinct ideas, the most simple elements of thought from which all\nknowledge, the Cartesians held, could be derived a priori by way of\ndeductive rules. As Vico had already argued, one consequence and\ndrawback of this hypothetico-deductive method is that it renders\nphenomena which cannot be expressed logically or mathematically as\nillusions of one sort or another. This applies not only most obviously\nto the data of sense and psychological experience, but also to the\nnon-quantifiable evidence that makes up the human sciences. Drawing on\nthe verum factum principle first described in De\nAntiquissima, Vico argues against Cartesian philosophy that full\nknowledge of any thing involves discovering how it came to be\nwhat it is as a product of human action and the “principal\nproperty” of human beings, viz., “of being social”\n(“Idea of the Work,” §2,\n p.3).[7]\nThe reduction of all facts to the ostensibly paradigmatic form of\nmathematical knowledge is a form of “conceit,” Vico\nmaintains, which arises from the fact that “man makes himself\nthe measure of all things” (Element I, §120, p.60) and that\n“whenever men can form no idea of distant and unknown things,\nthey judge them by what is familiar and at hand” (Element II,\n§122, p.60).  Recognizing this limitation, Vico argues, is at\nonce to grasp that phenomena can only be known via their origins, or\nper caussas (through causes). For “Doctrines must take their\nbeginning from that of the matters of which they treat” (Element\nCVI, §314, p.92), he says, and it is one “great labor\nof...Science to recover...[the] grounds of truth-truth which, with the\npassage of years and the changes in language and customs, has come\ndown to us enveloped in falsehood” (Element XVI, §150,\npp.64–5). Unveiling this falsehood leads to “wisdom,”\nwhich is “nothing but the science of making such use of things\nas their nature dictates” (Element CXIV, §326, p.94). Given\nthat verum ipsum factum-“the true is the made,”\nor something is true because it is made-scienzia\nboth sets knowledge per caussas as its task and as the method for\nattaining it; or, expressed in other terms, the content\nof scienza is identical with the development of\nthat scienza itself. \n\nThe challenge, however, is to develop this science in such a way as to\nunderstand the facts of the human world without either reducing them\nto mere contingency or explaining their order by way of speculative\nprinciples of the sort generated by traditional metaphysics. They must\nbe rendered intelligible, that is, without reducing them, as did the\nCartesians, to the status of ephemera. Vico satisfies this demand by\ndistinguishing at the outset of The New Science\nbetween il vero and il certo, “the true”\nand “the certain.” The former is the object of knowledge\n(scienza) since it is universal and eternal, whereas the\nlatter, related as it is to human consciousness (coscienza),\nis particular and individuated.  This produces two pairs of\nterms-il vero/scienza and\nil certo/coscienza-which constitute, in turn, the\nexplananda of philosophy and philology (“history” broadly conceived),\nrespectively. As Vico says, “philosophy contemplates reason, whence\ncomes knowledge of the true; philology observes that of which human\nchoice is author, whence comes consciousness of the certain” (Element\nX, §138, p.63). These two disciplines combine in a method or “new\ncritical art” (nuova’arte critica) where philosophy aims at\narticulating the universal forms of intelligibility common to all\nexperience, while philology adumbrates the empirical phenomena of the\nworld which arise from human choice: the languages, customs, and\nactions of people which make up civil society. Understood as mutually\nexclusive disciplines-a tendency evident, according to Vico, in the\nhistory of philosophy up to his time-philosophy and philology appear as\nempty and abstract (as in the rational certainty of Cartesian\nmetaphysics) and merely empirical and contingent, respectively. Once\ncombined, however, they form a doctrine which yields a full knowledge\nof facts where “knowledge” in the Vichean sense means to have grasped\nboth the necessity of human affairs (manifest in the causal connections\nbetween otherwise random events) and the contingency of the events\nwhich form the content of the causal chains. Philosophy yields the\nuniversally true and philology the individually certain. \n\nThe text of The New Science then constitutes Vico’s attempt\nto develop a method which itself comes to be in the course of applying\nit to human experience, and this takes the form of a history of civil\nsociety and its development through the progress of war and peace,\nlaw, social order, commerce, and government. “Thus our\nScience,” Vico says near the beginning of the work, “comes\nto be at once a history of the ideas, the customs, the deeds of\nmankind. From these three we shall derive the principles of the\nhistory of human nature, which we shall show to be the principles of\nuniversal history, which principles it seems hitherto to have\nlacked” (“Poetic Wisdom,” §368, p.112).\nAccomplishing this task involves tracing human society back to its\norigins in order to reveal a common human nature and a genetic,\nuniversal pattern through which all nations run. Vico sees this common\nnature reflected in language, conceived as a store-house of customs,\nin which the wisdom of successive ages accumulates and is presupposed\nin the form of a sensus communis or “mental\ndictionary” by subsequent generations. Vico defines this common\nsense as “judgment without reflection, shared by an entire\nclass, an entire people, and entire nation, or the entire human\nrace” (Element XII, §145, pp.63–4). It is also available to\nthe philosopher who, by deciphering and thus recovering its content,\ncan discover an “ideal eternal history traversed in time by the\nhistories of all nations” (Proposition XLII, §114,\np.57). \n\nThe result of this, in Vico’s view, is to appreciate history as at\nonce “ideal”-since it is never perfectly actualized-and\n“eternal,” because it reflects the presence of a divine\norder or Providence guiding the development of human\ninstitutions. Nations need not develop at the same pace-less developed\nones can and do coexist with those in a more advanced phase-but they\nall pass through the same distinct stages (corsi): the ages\nof gods, heroes, and men. Nations “develop in conformity to this\ndivision,” Vico says, “by a constant and uninterrupted\norder of causes and effects present in every nation” (“The\nCourse the Nations Run,” §915, p.335). Each stage, and thus\nthe history of any nation, is characterized by the manifestation of\nnatural law peculiar to it, and the distinct languages (signs,\nmetaphors, and words), governments (divine, aristocratic\ncommonwealths, and popular commonwealths and monarchies), as well as\nsystems of jurisprudence (mystic theology, heroic jurisprudence, and\nthe natural equity of free commonwealths) that define them. \n\nIn addition to specifying the distinct stages through which social,\ncivil, and political order develops, Vico draws on his earlier\nwritings to trace the origin of nations back to two distinct features\nof human nature: the ages of gods and heroes result from memory and\ncreative acts of “imagination” (fantasia), while\nthe age of men stems from the faculty of “reflection”\n(riflessione). Vico thus claims to have discovered two kinds\nof wisdom-“poetic” and\n“philosophical”-corresponding to the dual nature of human\nbeings (sense and intellect), represented in the creations of\ntheological poets and philosophers, respectively (“Poetic\nWisdom,” §779, p.297).  Institutions arise first from the\nimmediacy of sense-experience, pure feeling, curiosity, wonder, fear,\nsuperstition, and the child-like capacity of human beings to imitate\nand anthropomorphize the world around them. Since “in the\nworld’s childhood men were by nature sublime poets” (Element\nXXXVII, §187, p.71), Vico reasons, nations must be “poetic\nin their beginnings” (Element XLIV, §200, p.73), so that\ntheir origin and course can be discovered by recreating or remembering\nthe “poetic” or “metaphysical truth” which\nunderlies them (Element XLVII, §205, p.74). This is manifest\nprimarily in fable, myth, the structure of early languages, and the\nformations of polytheistic religion. The belief systems of early\nsocieties are thus characterized by “poetic metaphysics”\nwhich “seeks its proofs not in the external world but within the\nmodifications of the mind of him who meditates it”\n(“Poetic Wisdom,” §374, p.116), and “poetic\nlogic,” through which the creations of this metaphysics are\nsignified. Metaphysics of this sort is “not rational and\nabstract like that of learned men now,” Vico emphasizes,\n“but felt and imagined [by men] without power of\nratiocination...This metaphysics was their poetry, a faculty born with\nthem...born of their ignorance of causes, for ignorance, the mother of\nwonder, made everything wonderful to men who were ignorant of\neverything” (“Poetic Wisdom,” §375,\np.116). Incapable of forming “intelligible class concepts of\nthings”-a feature of human mind realized only in the age of\nmen-people “had a natural need to create poetic characters; that\nis, imaginative class concepts or universals, to which, as to certain\nmodels or ideal portraits, to reduce all the particular species which\nresembled them” (Element XLIX, §209, p.74). \n\nFrom this genus of poetic metaphysics, Vico then extrapolates the\nvarious species of wisdom born of it. “Poetic morals” have\ntheir source in piety and shame (“Poetic Wisdom,”\n§502, p.170), he argues, while “poetic economy”\narises from the feral equality of human beings and the family\nrelationships into which they were forced by need (“Poetic\nWisdom,” §523, p.180). Similarly, “poetic\ncosmography” grows from the seeing “the world as composed\nof gods of the sky, of the underworld...and gods intermediate between\nearth and sky” (“Poetic Wisdom,” §710, p.269),\n“poetic astronomy” from raising the gods “to the\nplanets and [assigning] the heroes to the constellations”\n(“Poetic Wisdom,” §728, p.277), “poetic\nchronology” out of the cycles of harvest and the seasons\n(“Poetic Wisdom,” §732, p.279), and “poetic\ngeography” from naming the natural world through “the\nsemblances of things known or near at hand” (“Poetic\nWisdom,” §741, p.285). As the faculty of reason develops\nand grows, however, the power of imagination from which the earliest\nforms of human society grew weakens and gives way finally to the power\nof reflection; the cognitive powers of human beings gain ascendance\nover their creative capacity, and reason replaces poetry as the\nprimary way of understanding the world. This defines the age of men\nwhich makes philosophy, Vico reasons, a relatively recent development\nin history, appearing as it did “some two thousand years after\nthe gentile nations were founded” (Element CV, §313,\np.92). \n\nSince history itself, in Vico’s view, is the manifestation of\nProvidence in the world, the transition from one stage to the next and\nthe steady ascendance of reason over imagination represent a gradual\nprogress of civilization, a qualitative improvement from simpler to\nmore complex forms of social organization. Vico characterizes this\nmovement as a “necessity of nature” (“Idea of the\nWork,” §34, p.21) which means that, with the passage of\ntime, human beings and societies tend increasingly towards realizing\ntheir full potential.  From rude beginnings undirected passion is\ntransformed into virtue, the bestial state of early society is\nsubordinated to the rule of law, and philosophy replaces sentiments of\nreligion. “Out of ferocity, avarice, and ambition, the three\nvices which run throughout the human race,” Vico says,\n“legislation creates the military, merchant, and governing\nclasses, and thus the strength, riches, and wisdom of commonwealths.\nOut of these three great vices, which could certainly destroy all\nmankind on the face of the earth, it makes civil happiness”\n(Element VII, §132, p.62). In addition, the transition from\npoetic to rational consciousness enables reflective individuals-the\nphilosopher, that is, in the shape of Vico-to recover the body of\nuniversal history from the particularity of apparently random\nevents. This is a fact attested to by the form and content of The\nNew Science itself. \n\nAlthough from a general point of view history reveals a progress of\ncivilization through actualizing the potential of human nature, Vico\nalso emphasizes the cyclical feature of historical\ndevelopment. Society progresses towards perfection, but without\nreaching it (thus history is “ideal”), interrupted as it\nis by a break or return (ricorso) to a relatively more\nprimitive condition. Out of this reversal, history begins its course\nanew, albeit from the irreversibly higher point to which it has\nalready attained. Vico observes that in the latter part of the age of\nmen (manifest in the institutions and customs of medieval feudalism)\nthe “barbarism” which marks the first stages of civil\nsociety returns as a “civil disease” to corrupt the body\npolitic from within. This development is marked by the decline of\npopular commonwealths into bureaucratic monarchies, and, by the force\nof unrestrained passions, the return of corrupt manners which had\ncharacterized the earlier societies of gods and heroes. Out of this\n“second barbarism,” however, either through the appearance\nof wise legislators, the rise of the fittest, or a the last vestiges\nof civilization, society returns to the “primitive simplicity of\nthe first world of peoples,” and individuals are again\n“religious, truthful, and faithful” (“Conclusion of\nthe Work,” §1104–1106, pp.423–4). From this begins a\nnew corso which Vico saw manifest in his own time as the\n“second age of men” characterized by the\n“true” Christian religion and the monarchical government\nof seventeenth century Europe. \n\nIn addition to his account of the origins and history of civil society\ndeveloped in The New Science, Vico also advances a highly\noriginal thesis about the origin and character of Homeric poetry,\nwhich he refers to as “The Discovery of the New Homer.”\nVico observes that the “vulgar feelings and vulgar customs\nprovide the poets with their proper materials” (“Discovery\nof the True Homer,” §781, p.301), and, given that in the\nage of heroes these customs constituted a “savage” and\n“unreasonable” state of human nature, the poetry of Homer\ncannot be the esoteric wisdom or creative act of a single individual,\nas scholars have assumed, but represents the imaginative universals of\nthe Greek people themselves. Homeric poetry thus contains the\n“models or ideal portraits” which form the mental\ndictionary of the Ancients, and explains the place Vico assigns to\nHomer in the frontispiece where his statue represents the origins of\nhuman society in poetic wisdom. Vico thus applies his doctrine of the\nimaginative universal to the case of Homer and concludes that though\nit “marks a famous epoch in history it never in the world took\nplace.” The historical Homer was “quite simply a man of\nthe people” (“Discovery of the True Homer, §806,\np.308) and quite distinct from the ostensible author of the Odyssey\nand Iliad who was actually a ”purely ideal poet who never\nexisted in the world of nature...but was an idea or a heroic character\nof Grecian men insofar as they told their histories in song“\n(”Discovery of the True Homer, §873, p.323).","contact.mail":"tmcost@wm.edu","contact.domain":"wm.edu"}]
