In La Géométrie,\nDescartes details a groundbreaking program for geometrical\nproblem-solving—what he refers to as a “geometrical\ncalculus” (calcul géométrique)—that\nrests on a distinctive approach to the relationship between algebra\nand geometry. Specifically, Descartes offers innovative algebraic\ntechniques for analyzing geometrical problems, a novel way of\nunderstanding the connection between a curve’s construction and\nits algebraic equation, and an algebraic classification of curves that\nis based on the degree of the equations used to represent these\ncurves.\n\n\nThe problem-solving techniques and mathematical results that Descartes\npresents in La Géométrie were both novel and\nincredibly influential on the practice of early modern mathematics.\nHowever, we can also locate in La Géométrie a\nphilosophical significance: The blending of algebra and geometry and\nthe peculiar approach to the “geometrical” status of\ncurves which characterize Descartes’ mathematical program stand\nas notable contributions to the on-going philosophical debates that\nsurrounded early modern mathematical practice. By drawing on the\ncontext in which Descartes’ mathematical researches took place,\nand examining the main questions and issues that shaped\nDescartes’ early mathematical researches, both the historical\nand philosophical significance of Books One and Two of La\nGéométrie will be highlighted in what\n follows.[1]\n \nWhen Descartes’ mathematical researches commenced in the early\nseventeenth century, mathematicians were wrestling with questions\nconcerning the appropriate methods for geometrical proof and, in\nparticular, the criteria for identifying curves that met the exact and\nrigorous standards of geometry and that could thus be used in\ngeometrical problem-solving. These issues were given an added sense of\nurgency for practicing mathematicians when, in 1588,\nCommandino’s Latin translation of Pappus’s\nCollection (early fourth century CE) was published. In the\nCollection Pappus appeals to the ancient practice of geometry\nas he offers normative claims about how geometrical problems ought to\nbe solved. Early modern readers gave special attention to\nPappus’s proposals concerning (1) how a mathematician should\nconstruct the curves used in geometrical proof, and (2) how a geometer\nshould apply the methods of analysis and synthesis in geometrical\nproblem-solving. The construction of curves will be treated in 1.1 and\nanalysis and synthesis in section 1.2 below. \nPappus’s claims regarding the proper methods for constructing\ngeometrical curves are couched in terms of the ancient classification\nof geometrical problems, which he famously describes in Book III of\nthe Collection: \nThe ancients stated that there are three kinds of geometrical\nproblems, and that some are called plane, others solid, and others\nline-like; and those that can be solved by straight lines and the\ncircumference of a circle are rightly called plane because the lines\nby means of which these problems are solved have their origin in the\nplane. But such problems that must be solved by assuming one or more\nconic sections in the construction, are called solid because for their\nconstruction it is necessary to use the surfaces of solid figures,\nnamely cones. There remains a third kind that is called line-like. For\nin their construction other lines than the ones just mentioned are\nassumed, having an inconstant and changeable origin, such as spirals,\nand the curves that the Greeks call tetragonizousas\n[“square-making”], and which we call\n“quandrantes,” and conchoids, and cissoids, which have\nmany amazing properties (Pappus 1588, III, §7; translation from\nBos 2001, 38). \nWe notice in the above remarks that Pappus bases his classification of\ngeometrical problems on the construction of the curves necessary for\nthe solution of a problem: If a problem is solved by a curve\nconstructible by straightedge and compass, it is planar; if a problem\nis solved by a curve constructible by conic section, it is solid; and\nif a problem is solved by a curve that requires a more complicated\nconstruction—that has an “inconstant and changeable\norigin”—, it is line-like. Though a seemingly\nstraightforward directive for how to classify geometrical problems,\nthere remained an ambiguity in Pappus’s text about whether the\nso-called solid and line-like problems—problems that required\nthe construction of conics and more complicated curves, such as the\nspiral—were in fact solvable by genuinely geometrical methods.\nThat is, there was an ambiguity, and thus, an open question for early\nmodern mathematicians, about whether problems that could not be solved\nby straightedge and compass construction met the rigorous standards of\ngeometry. (For the special status of constructions by straightedge and\ncompass in Greek mathematics, see Heath (1921) and Knorr (1986). For\nhelpful overviews of the historical development of Greek mathematics,\nsee classics such as Merzbach and Boyer (2011) and volume 1 of Kline\n(1972).) \nA few examples will help clarify what is at stake here. The problem of\nbisecting a given angle is counted among planar problems, because, as\ndetailed by Euclid in Elements I.9, to construct the line\nsegment that divides a given angle into two equal parts, we construct\n(by compass) three circles of equal radius, and then (by straightedge)\njoin the vertex of the angle with the point at which the circles\nintersect (Euclid 1956, Volume I, 264–265). Notice here that, to\ngenerate the solution, curves are used to construct a point that gives\nthe solution to the problem, namely, by constructing the circles, we\nidentify a point that allows us to bisect the curve. (When dealing\nwith locus problems, such as the Pappus problem, the curves that are\nconstructed are themselves the solution to the problem. See\n section 3\n below.) The problem of trisecting an angle, on the other hand, was\nconsidered a line-like problem, because its solution required the\nconstruction of curves, such as the spiral, which were not\nconstructible by straightedge and compass. Perhaps most famous among\nline-like problems is that of squaring the circle; for those who\ndeemed this problem solvable, the solution required the construction\nof a curve such as the quadratrix, a curve that was proposed by the\nancients in order to solve this very problem (which is how the curve\nreceived its name). Certainly, the generation of such curves could be\ndescribed; Archimedes famously describes the generation of the spiral\nin Definition 1 of his Spirals and Pappus describes the\ngeneration of the quadratrix in Book IV of the Collection.\nHowever, these descriptions were considered “more\ncomplicated” precisely because they go beyond the intersection\nof curves that are generated by straightedge and compass construction.\nFor instance, according to Archimedes, the spiral is generated by\nuniformly moving a line segment around a given point while tracing the\npath of a point that itself moves uniformly along the line segment.\nAnd, according to Pappus, the quadratrix is generated by the uniform\nmotions of two line segments, where one segment moves around the\ncenter of a given circle and the other moves through a quadrant of the\ncircle. (Cf. Bos 2001, 40–42 for the details of both these\nconstructions.) In a similar vein, the construction of conics was\nconsidered more complicated: One of the accepted techniques for\nconstructing a conic required cutting a cone in a specified way, which\nagain, went beyond the consideration of intersecting curves that were\nconstructible by straightedge and compass. \nIn the Collection, Pappus does not offer a firm verdict on\nwhether the conics and “more complicated” curves meet the\nrigorous standards of geometrical construction and hence, on whether\nthey are admissible in the domain of geometry. In the case of the\nconics, he relies on Apollonius’s commentary and reports the\nusefulness of these curves for the synthesis (or proofs) of some\nproblems (Pappus, 116). However, to claim a curve useful is quite\ndifferent from claiming it can be constructed by properly geometrical\nmethods (as we’ll see more clearly below). Moreover, in the case\nof the quadratrix, Pappus sets out the description of the curve in\nBook IV of the Collection, and then immediately proceeds to\nidentify the common objections to the curve’s description, e.g.,\nthat there is a petitio principii in the very definition of\nthe curve, without commenting on whether these objections can be\novercome. Thus, although it was known by the ancients that conics and\nother complicated curves could be used to solve outstanding problems,\nit was not clear to early modern mathematicians whether the ancients\nconsidered these solutions genuinely geometrical. In other words, it\nwas not clear from Pappus’s Collection whether these\ncurves were admissible in geometrical problem-solving and therefore,\nwhether solid problems (such as identifying the mean proportionals\nbetween given line segments) or line-like problems (such as trisecting\nan angle and squaring the circle) had genuine geometrical\nsolutions. \nConsequently, after the publication of Commandino’s translation\nof the Collection, early modern mathematicians gave added\nattention to the questions of whether and why these curves should be\nused in geometrical problem-solving. The spiral and quadratrix were\nprominent in such discussions, because, as noted above, they could be\nused to address some of the more famous outstanding geometrical\nproblems, namely, angle trisection and squaring the circle.\n [2]\n For instance, in his second and expanded (1589) edition of\nEuclid’s Elements (which was first published in 1574)\nas well as in his Geometria practica (1604), Christoph\nClavius discusses the status of the quadratrix. Accepting the\nobjections to the description of the quadratrix detailed by Pappus in\nthe Collection, Clavius supplies what he deems a “truly\ngeometrical” construction of the curve that would legitimize its\nuse in geometrical problem-solving, and in solving the problem of\nsquaring the circle in particular. His construction is a pointwise\none: We begin with a quadrant of a circle (as in Pappus’s\ndescription) but rather than relying on the intersection of uniformly\nmoving segments to describe the curve, Clavius proceeds by first\nidentifying the points of intersection between segments that bisect\nthe quadrant and segments that bisect the arc of the quadrant. That\nis, we identify the several intersecting points of segments which are\nconstructible by straightedge and compass, and then, to generate the\nquadratrix, we connect the (arbitrarily many) intersecting points,\nwhich are evenly spaced along the sought after curve. Therefore, to\nconstruct the quadratrix according to Clavius’s method, we still\ngo beyond basic straightedge and compass constructions (connecting the\npoints in this case cannot be done by straightedge, as in the case of\nbisection), but one need not consider the simultaneous motions of\nlines as Pappus’s construction requires. (See Bos 2001,\n161–162 for Clavius’s construction of the quadratrix and\ncompare with Pappus’s construction on Bos 2001, 40–42. For\nDescartes’ assessment of Clavius’s pointwise construction\nsee\n section 3.3\n below.) \nAccording to Clavius’s commentary of 1589, this pointwise\nconstruction of the quadratrix was an improvement over that offered by\nPappus, because it was more accurate: Since the pointwise construction\nallowed one to identify arbitrarily many points along the curve, one\ncould trace the quadratrix with greater precision than if one had to\nconsider the intersection of two moving lines. To support his case,\nClavius relates his pointwise construction of the quadratrix with the\npointwise construction of conics proposed by the “great\ngeometer” Apollonius and claims that “unless someone wants\nto reject as useless and ungeometrical the whole doctrine of conic\nsections” proposed by Apollonius, “one is forced to accept\nour present description of the [quadratrix] as entirely\ngeometrical” (cited in Bos 2001, 163). However, in his later\nGeometria practica (1604), Clavius tempers his assessment of\nboth the quadratrix and the conics. He maintains that these more\ncomplicated curves could be constructed by pointwise methods that\noffered greater precision, but the curves thus generated were no\nlonger presented as absolutely geometrical. Instead, they were\npresented as “more accurate,” “easier,” and\ngeometrical “in a certain way” (Bos 2001,\n164–5). \nIn his Supplement of geometry (1593), François\nViète also addresses the outstanding problems of geometry that\nwere solvable by curves that could not constructed by straightedge and\ncompass. He claims that at least some such problems could be solved by\nproperly geometrically means by adopting as his postulate that the\nso-called neusis problem could be solved. That is, he assumed that\ngiven two lines, a point \\(O\\), and a segment \\(a\\), it was possible\nto draw a straight line through \\(O\\) intersecting the two lines in\npoints \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) such that \\(AB = a\\) (Bos 2001,\n167–168). In the Supplement, Viète shows that\nonce we accept as a fundamental geometrical postulate that the neusis\nproblem is solvable, then we can, by legitimately geometrical means,\nsolve the problems of trisecting a given angle and of constructing the\ntwo mean proportional between two given line segments. Specifically\nand importantly, we generate these solutions without having to rely on\nthe construction of conics or higher-order curves, such as the spiral\nor quadratrix (Bos 2001, 168). \nThe neusis postulate was a powerful tool in Viète’s\nproblem-solving arsenal: By assuming that the neusis problem could be\nsolved, he expanded the domain of acceptable geometrical constructions\nbeyond straightedge and compass. However, questions remained about the\nacceptability of this assumption as a postulate, since Viète\ndoes not detail the construction of the neusis problem but simply\nclaims that the neusis postulate should not be difficult for his\nreaders to accept. In making this assumption, he was taking a\nsignificant departure from ancient geometers, for whom the neusis\nproblem could only be solved by curves that were not constructible by\nstraightedge and compass. For instance, Pappus rendered the\nconstruction of the neusis a solid problem and solved it by means of\nconics in Book IV of the Collection, and Nicomedes rendered\nthe construction of the neusis a line-like problem and devised the\ncissoid for its solution. (See Bos 2001, 53–54 for\nPappus’s solution and 30–33 for Nicomedes’ solution.\nSee also Pappus 1986, 112–114 for the classification of the\nneusis as a sold problem.) \nNonetheless, according to Viète, if a problem could not be\nsolved by neusis, then questions of legitimacy remained. For instance,\nneither the spiral nor the quadratrix—curves used to square the\ncircle by Archimedes and Pappus, respectively—could be\nconstructed in the same obvious and “not difficult” way as\nthe neusis. Viète appears to grant that the pointwise\nconstruction of the quadratrix, such as that presented by Clavius, was\nin fact more precise than other constructions of the curve, but,\nViète claims, this greater precision does not legitimize its\nstatus as genuinely geometrical. Indeed, such precise descriptions\nrelied on instruments and, thus, on the mechanical arts and, as such,\nwere not geometrical. Moreover, Viète claimed that, in general,\ncurves not constructed by the intersection of curves, such as the\nArchimedean spiral, were “not described in the way of true\nknowledge” (Bos 2001, 177). Therefore, just as the quadratrix,\nthese curves were not legitimately geometrical, which left the problem\nof squaring the circle an open problem for Viète. \nViète’s program of geometrical problem-solving had an\nadded significance: By adopting as his postulate that the neusis\nproblem could be solved, Viète was able to link geometrical\nconstruction with his algebraic analysis of geometrical problems and\nshow that cubic equations had a genuinely geometrical solution (i.e.,\nthat the roots of cubic equations could be constructed by\nconsideration of intersecting geometrical curves).\nViète’s program nicely illustrates the merging of algebra\nwith geometrical problem-solving in early modern mathematics, and\nmoreover, nicely illustrates an influential way of interpreting\nPappus’s claims in the Collection regarding how a\nmathematician should apply the methods of analysis and synthesis in\ngeometrical problem-solving. \nAs noted above, Pappus’s remarks concerning the two-fold method\nof analysis (resolutio) and synthesis (compositio)\nin the Collection received a great deal of attention from\nearly modern readers. And as with his remarks concerning the\nconstruction of geometrical curves, there were ambiguities in his\ndiscussion, which motivated varying interpretations of the method and\nits application to geometrical problems. Here is a portion of what\nPappus claims of analysis and synthesis in Book VII of the\nCollection: \nNow analysis is the path from what one is seeking, as if it were\nestablished, by way of its consequences, to something that is\nestablished by synthesis. That is to say, in analysis we assume what\nis sought as if it has been achieved, and look for the thing from\nwhich it follows, and again what comes before that, until by\nregressing in this way we come upon some one of the things that are\nalready known, or that occupy the rank of a first principle. We call\nthis kind of method “analysis,” as if to say anapalin\nlysis (reduction backward). In synthesis, by reversal, we assume\nwhat was obtained last in the analysis to have been achieved already,\nand, setting now in natural order, as precedents, what before were\nfollowing, and fitting them to each other, we attain the end of the\nconstruction of what was sought. This is what we call\n“synthesis” (Pappus, 82–83). \nSome of the directives Pappus offers here seem straightforward. The\nmathematician begins by assuming what is sought after as if it has\nbeen achieved until, through analysis, she reaches something that is\nalready known. Then, the mathematician reverses the steps, and through\nsynthesis, sets out “in natural order” the deduction\nleading from what is known to what is sought after. However, there are\nambiguities in Pappus’s discussion. Perhaps most importantly, it\nis not clear how reversing the steps of analysis could offer a proof,\nor synthesis, of a stated problem, since the deductions of analysis\nrely on conditionals (if \\(x\\), then \\(y)\\) whereas a\nreversal would require biconditionals \\((x\\) iff \\(y)\\) to\nachieve synthesis (see Guicciardini 2009, 31–38 for further\ninterpretative problems surrounding Pappus’s remarks; for more\non analysis and synthesis in the Renaissance see the classic Hintikka\nand Remes 1974, the essays in Otte and Panza 1997, and Panza 2007).\nAmbiguities notwithstanding, for Viète and other early modern\nmathematicians there was one feature of the discussion that was\nincredibly important: Pappus makes clear that the ancients had a\nmethod of analysis at their disposal, and many early modern\nmathematicians attempted to align this method from antiquity with the\nalgebraic methods of geometrical analysis that they were using. \nPrior to the end of the sixteenth century, mathematicians had already\nused algebra in the analysis of geometrical problems, but the program\nViète details marks a significant step forward. On the one\nhand, in his Isagoge [Introduction to the analytic\nart] of 1591, which was presented as part of a larger project to\nrestore ancient analysis (entitled Book of the restored\nmathematical analysis or the new algebra), Viète\nintroduces a notation that allowed him to treat magnitudes in a\ngeneral way. The literal symbols he uses (consonants and vowels\ndepending on whether the variable in the equation was unknown or\nindeterminate, respectively) represent magnitudes generally and do not\nspecify whether they are arithmetical magnitudes (numbers) or\ngeometrical magnitudes (such as line segments or angles). He can thus\nrepresent arithmetic operations as applied to magnitudes in general.\nFor instance, \\(A + B\\) represents the addition of two\nmagnitudes and does not specify whether \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are\nnumbers (in which case the addition represents a process of counting)\nor geometrical objects (in which case the addition represents the\ncombination of two line segments) (see Viète 1591, 11–27;\nfor the significance of Viète’s “new algebra”\nfor early modern mathematics see Bos 2001, Chp. 8; Mahoney 1973, Chp.\n2; and Pycior 1997, Chp. 1). \nOn the other hand, the algebraic, symbolic analysis of geometrical\nproblems that Viète proposes was offered as the first step in a\nthree-step process that could render a geometrical solution. The three\nstages were: (1) zetetics, which involved the algebraic\nanalysis (or elaboration) of a problem; (2) poristics, which\nclarified the relations between magnitudes by appeal to the theory of\nproportions (see Giusti 1992 on the importance of proportion theory\nfor Viète’s mathematics); and (3) exegetics,\nwhich offered the genuine geometrical solution (or proof) of the\nproblem. To better understand the connection between the stages of\nzetetics and exegetics, which roughly correspond to\nthe ancient stages of analysis and synthesis, consider the problem of\nidentifying two mean proportionals. Geometrically, the problem is as\nfollows: \nGiven line segments \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), find \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) such that\n\\(a : x :: x : y :: y : b\\), or put differently, such that \nIn the zetetic (analytic) stage of Viète’s\nanalysis, we follow Pappus’s directive to treat “what is\nsought as if it has been achieved” precisely by naming the\nunknowns by variables. Then, by assuming the equivalence between\nproportions (as Viète does), we can solve for the variables\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and establish that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\nhave the following relationship to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\): \nSolving (1) for \\(y\\), we have \\(y = x^2 /a\\), and by substitution into (2), we\nget \\(y^2 = (x^2 /a)^2 = x^4 /a^2 = xb\\), which\nyields: \nSolving (2) for \\(x\\), we have \\(x = y^2 /b\\), and by substitution\ninto (1), we get \\(x^2 = (y^2 /b)^2 = y^4 /b^2 = ay\\), which\nyields: \nAlgebraically, then, the problem of finding two mean proportional can\nbe elaborated as follows: \nGiven (magnitudes) \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the problem is to find\n(magnitudes) \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) such that \\(x^3 = a^2 b\\) and \n\\(y^3 = ab^2\\). \nIn this zetetic stage of analysis, the geometrical problem is\ntransformed into the algebraic problem of solving a standard-form\ncubic equation (i.e., a cubic equation that does not include a\nquadratic term). However, for Viète, the genuine solution to\nthe problem must be supplied in the stage of exegetics, which offers\nthe geometrical construction and thus the synthesis, or\n proof.[3]\n And it is here that the neusis postulate supplies the guarantee that\nsuch a solution can be found: By assuming the neusis problem solved,\nwe can construct the curve that satisfies the two cubic equations\nabove (i.e., we can construct the roots of the equations) and thereby\nconstruct the sought after mean proportionals. In other words, there\nwas an assumed equivalence in Viète’s program between\nsolving an algebraic problem that required identifying the roots of\nspecified cubic equations and solving a geometrical problem that\nrequired the construction of a curve. We also see this in his\ntreatment of trisecting an angle: To solve the angle-trisection\nproblem is to solve two standard-form cubic equations, which\nViète reveals in his algebraic elaboration of the geometrical\nproblem (cf. Bos 2001, 173–176). In fact, assuming the neusis\npostulate, we can solve any standard-form cubic equation, and since it\nwas already known at the time that all fourth-degree equations are\nreducible to standard-form cubic equations, what Viète supplied\nwith his marriage of algebra and geometry in his 1594\nSupplement was a program that solved all line-like problems\nthat could be elaborated in terms of cubic and quartic equations. \nAs powerful as Viète’s program was, questions remained\nfor practicing mathematicians. Should we, as Viète urged,\naccept the neusis postulate as “not difficult” and thus as\na foundational construction principle for geometry? And should we\nfollow Viète in claiming that other curves that had significant\nproblem-solving power in geometry—such as the spiral and\nquadratrix—were not legitimately geometrical because they could\nnot be constructed by neusis? Moreover, there were questions about the\nconnection Viète forged between algebra and geometry. For\nDescartes in particular, there were questions of whether there was a\ndeeper, more fundamental connection that could be forged between the\nsolutions of algebraic problems that were expressed in terms of\nequations and the solutions of geometrical problems that required the\nconstruction of curves. However, these questions did not come into\nfull relief for Descartes until the early 1630s, after more than a\ndecade of studying problems in both geometry and algebra. \nBased on the autobiographical narrative included in Part One of the\nDiscourse on Method (1637), where Descartes describes what he\nlearned when he was “at one of the most famous schools in\nEurope” (AT VI, 5; CSM I, 113), it is generally agreed that\nDescartes’ initial study of mathematics commenced when he was a\nstudent at La Fleche. He reports in the Discourse that, when\nwe he was younger, his mathematical studies included some geometrical\nanalysis and algebra (AT VI, 17; CSM I, 119), and he also mentions\nthat he “delighted in mathematics, because of the certainty and\nself-evidence of its reasonings” (AT VI, 7; CSM I, 114).\nHowever, no specific texts or mathematical problems are mentioned in\nthe 1637 autobiographical sketch. Thus, we rely on remarks made in\ncorrespondence for the more specific details of Descartes’ study\nof mathematics at La Fleche, and these remarks strongly suggest that\nClavius was a key figure in Descartes’ earliest (perhaps even\ninitial) study of mathematics. For instance, in a letter from March\n1646 written by John Pell to Charles Cavendish, we have good reason to\nbelieve that ca. 1616, while a student at La Fleche, Descartes read\nClavius’s Algebra (1608). Reporting on his meeting with\nDescartes in Amsterdam earlier that same year, Pell writes in\nparticular that “[Descartes] says he had no other instructor for\nAlgebra than ye reading of Clavy Algebra above 30 years ago”\n(cited in Sasaki 2003, 47; cf. AT IV, 729–730 and Sasaki 2003,\n45–47 for other relevant portions of that letter). Moreover, in\na 13 November 1629 letter written to Mersenne, Descartes refers to the\nsecond (1589) edition of Clavius’s annotated version of\nEuclid’s Elements, in which, as noted above, Clavius\npresents his pointwise construction of the quadratrix and uses the\ncurve to solve the problem of squaring the circle (AT I, 70–71;\nthe portion of the letter that references Clavius is translated in\nSasaki (2003), 47). And following Sasaki (2003), it is reasonable to\nconclude that Descartes was at least aware of Clavius’ textbook\nGeometria practica (1604), which was included as part of the\nmathematics curriculum of La Fleche. (See Sasaki 2003, Chapter Two on\nClavius’ influence on and inclusion in the mathematics\ncurriculum of Jesuit schools in the early 1600s.) \nAlthough our evidence of the mathematics that Descartes studied at La\nFleche is sketchy, we are quite certain that Descartes’ entrance\ninto the debates of early modern mathematics began in earnest when he\nmet Isaac Beeckman in Breda, Holland in 1618. Among other things,\nBeeckman and Descartes explored the fruitfulness of applying\nmathematics to natural philosophy and discussed issues pertaining to\nphysico-mathematics. It is in this period that Descartes composed his\nCompendium musicae for Beeckman, a text in which he addresses\nthe application of mathematics to music and also famously discusses\nthe law of free fall. (Compare Koyré 1939, 99–128 and\nSchuster 2013, Chapter 3.5 on Descartes’ treatment of free fall\nin this early text. For discussion of Descartes’ pursuit of\ncausal knowledge in his physico-mathematical researches in optics\nduring this period, see Schuster 2013, Chapter 3.6.) \nBeyond having a common interest in applied mathematics, Beeckman and\nDescartes also discussed problems of pure mathematics, both in\ngeometry and in algebra, and Descartes’ interest in such\nproblems extended to 1628–1629, when he returned to Holland to\nmeet Beeckman after his travels through Germany, France, and Italy.\nOur understanding of what Descartes accomplished in pure mathematics\nduring this eleven year period relies on the following sources: \nA look at some of the problems and proposals found in these\nmathematical works will help situate Descartes in his early modern\nmathematical context and will also help to highlight the results from\nthis period that have an important connection to what is found in the\nopening books of the 1637 La Géométrie. To make\nthese connections clear, the brief narrative below emphasizes the\nproposals Descartes made during the 1618–1629 period concerning\n(1) the criteria for geometrical curves and legitimately geometrical\nconstructions, and (2) the relationship between algebra and\ngeometry. \nThe most famous letter written to Beeckman in 1619 dates from 26 March\nof that year. In this letter Descartes announces his plan to expound\nan “entirely new science [scientia penitus nova], by\nwhich all problems that can be posed, concerning any kind of quantity,\ncontinuous or discrete, can be generally solved” (AT X, 156). As\nhe elaborates on how this new science will proceed, Descartes\nclarifies that his solutions to the problems of discrete and\ncontinuous quantities—that is, of arithmetic and geometry,\nrespectively—will vary depending on the nature of the problem at\nhand. As he puts it, \n[In this new science] each problem will be solved according to its own\nnature as for example, in arithmetic some questions are resolved by\nrational numbers, others only by surd [irrational] numbers, and others\nfinally can be imagined but not solved. So also I hope to show for\ncontinuous quantities that some problems can be solved by straight\nlines and circles alone; others only by other curved lines, which,\nhowever, result from a single motion and can therefore be drawn with\nnew types of compasses, which are no less exact and geometrical, I\nthink, than the common ones used to draw circles; and finally others\nthat can be solved by curved lines generated by diverse motions not\nsubordinated to one another, which curves are certainly only imaginary\nsuch as the rather well-known quadratrix. I cannot imagine anything\nthat could not be solved by such lines at least, though I hope to show\nwhich questions can be solved in this or that way and not any other,\nso that almost nothing will remain to be found in geometry. It is, of\ncourse, an infinite task, not for one man only. Incredibly ambitious;\nbut I have seen some light through the dark chaos of the science, by\nthe help of which I think all the thickest darkness can be dispelled\n(AT X, 156–158; CSMK 2–3; translation from Sasaki 2003,\n102). \nWe notice in Descartes’ remarks concerning geometry in\nparticular that the “entirely new science” he proposes\nwill provide an exhaustive classification for problem-solving, where\neach of his three classes is determined by the curves needed for\nsolution. This suggests an important overlap between Descartes’\nthree classes of geometrical problems and Pappus’s three\nclasses, which, recall, were separated based on the types of curves\nrequired for solution: Planar problems are solvable by straightedge\nand compass, solid problems by conics, and line-like problems by more\ncomplicated curves that have an “inconstant and changeable\norigin.” However, there is also a significant difference between\ntheir classifications insofar as Descartes strongly suggests that\nthose problems that require “imaginary” curves for their\nsolution do not have a legitimately geometrical solution. Namely, just\nas some problems of arithmetic “can be imagined but not be\nsolved,” so too in geometry, there is a class of problems that\nrequire curves that are “certainly only imaginary,” i.e.,\ncurves generated by “diverse motions,” and thus that are\nnot geometrical in a proper sense. In this respect, Descartes is\nmoving from Pappus’s descriptive classification to a normative\none that separates geometrical curves from non-geometrical curves, and\nthereby distinguishes problems that have a legitimate geometrical\nsolution from those that do not. Just as importantly, we see in\nDescartes’ letter his attempt to expand the scope of legitimate\ngeometrical constructions beyond straightedge and compass by appealing\nto the motions needed to construct a curve. Specifically, as\nwe see in the passage above, Descartes relies on the “single\nmotions” of his “new types of compasses, which [he says]\nare no less exact and geometrical…than the common ones used to\ndraw circles” in order to mark out a new class of problems that\nhave legitimate geometrical solutions. \nIn his 26 March 1619 letter to Beeckman, Descartes does not elaborate\non the “new types of compasses” to which he refers; he\nsimply reports to Beeckman in the early portions of the letter that he\nhas, in a short time, “discovered four conspicuous and entirely\nnew demonstrations with the help of my compasses” (AT X, 154).\nFortunately, more details about these compasses and Descartes’\ndemonstrations are included in Cogitationes privatae, or\nPrivate Reflections (ca. 1619–1620), a text in which\nDescartes applies three different “new compasses” (often\nreferred to by commentators as “proportional compasses”)\nto the problems of (1) dividing a given angle into any number of equal\nparts, (2) constructing the roots of three types of cubic equations,\nand (3) describing a conic section. In the first two cases, as\nDescartes treats the angular section and mean proportional problems,\nthe compasses on which he relies are used to generate a curve that\nwill solve the problem at hand. Figure 1. Figure 2. \nFor instance, to solve the angular section problem, Descartes begins\nby presenting an instrument that includes four rulers (OA, OB, OC,\nOD), which are hinged at point O\n (figure 1).\n We then take four rods (HJ, FJ, GI, EI), which are of equal length\n\\(a\\), and attach them to the arms of the instrument such that\nthey are a distance \\(a\\) from O and are pair-wise hinged at\npoints J and I. Leaving OA stationary, we now move OD so as to vary\nthe measure of angle DOA, and following the path of point J, we\ngenerate the curve KLM\n (figure 2).\n As Descartes has it, we can construct the curve KLM on any\ngiven angle by means of the instrument described above, because the\nangle we are trisecting plays no role in the construction of KLM. And\nonce the curve KLM is constructed, the given angle can be trisected by\nmeans of some basic constructions with straight lines and circles. In\nthis respect, the curve KLM is, for Descartes, the means for solving\nthe angle trisection problem, and moreover, his treatment suggests\nthat the construction can be generalized further so that, by means of\nhis “new compass,” an angle can also be divided into 4, 5,\nor more equal parts. (I borrow my treatment of this construction from\nDomski 2009, 121, which is itself indebted to the presentation in Bos\n2001, 237–239.) Figure 3. Mesolabe \nA similar approach is taken by Descartes when he treats the problem of\nconstructing mean proportionals, where in this case, he appeals to his\nfamous mesolabe compass, an instrument that is used in Book Three of\nthe La Géométrie to solve the same problem. As\nin 1637, this compass is used to construct curves (the dotted lines in\n figure 3)\n that allow us to identify the mean proportionals between any number\nof given line segments. And as Viète before him, in the\nPrivate Reflections Descartes uses this construction of mean\nproportionals to identify the roots of standard-form cubic equations\n(see Bos 2001, 240–45). \nNotice that these constructions illustrate the sort of “single\nmotion” constructions to which Descartes refers in his 26 March\n1619 letter to Beeckman: His new compasses generate curves by the\nsingle motion of a designated arm of the compass, and thus, the curves\ngenerated in this manner meet the standard of geometrical\nintelligibility—the standard by which to distinguish geometrical\nfrom imaginary curves—that is alluded to in the brief outline of\nthe “entirely new science” that Descartes envisions. That\nsuch motions are completed by instruments does not threaten the\nconstructed curve’s geometrical status. (As we saw above,\nViète had leveled this charge against the instrumental,\npointwise constructions provided by Clavius.) And moreover, we already\nnotice in the mathematical research of 1619 Descartes’ focus on\nthe intelligibility of motions as a standard for identifying\nlegitimately geometrical curves. This theme will reemerge in Book Two\nof La Géométrie. \nIn addition, we find in Descartes’ early work an interest in the\nrelationship between algebra and geometry that will be crucial to the\nprogram of geometrical analysis presented in Book One of La\nGéométrie, where at this early stage of his\nresearch, Descartes, like his contemporaries, is exploring the\napplication of geometry to algebraic problems. For instance, as\npointed out above, Descartes uses the construction of mean\nproportionals to solve algebraic equations in the Private\nReflections, and in the same text he also shows an interest in\nthe geometrical representation of numbers and of arithmetical\noperations. The same interest appears again in the later\nProgymnasmata de solidorum elementis excerpta ex manuscripto\nCartesii (Preliminary exercises on the elements of solids\nextracted from a manuscript of Descartes, ca. 1623), a text in which\nDescartes offers a geometrical representation of numbers and of four\nof the five basic arithmetical operations (the four operations he\ntreats are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). \nThough there is some dispute among commentators about Descartes’\nlevel of expertise in algebra during this early 1619–1623 period\n(compare Bos 2001, 245 with Sasaki 2003, 126), texts from\n1628–1629 show Descartes making great advances in algebra in a\nrelatively small amount of time. Two textual sources are of particular\ninterest: (1) The specimen of algebra given to and transcribed by\nBeeckman in 1628 upon Descartes’ return to Holland, and (2) a\ntext on the construction of roots for cubic and quartic equations\ngiven to Beeckman in early\n 1629.[4]\n In the Specimen, Descartes presents a rather basic\nproblem-solving program (or schematism) for algebra that relies on\ntwo-dimensional figures (lines and surfaces). The texts given to\nBeeckman several months later, which Descartes composed while in\nHolland, show a great advance over what’s found in the\nSpecimen, since in these texts he appeals to conic sections\n(or solids) in his problem-solving regime. For instance, Descartes\nconstructs two mean proportionals by the intersection of circle and\nparabola (a method he had discovered around 1625 according to Bos\n2001, 255). More impressively, in a different text from this same\nperiod, Descartes offers a method for constructing all solid problems,\ni.e., for solving all third- and fourth-degree equations. \nWhile some of the results from this period are connected with the\nproblem-solving program presented in the 1637 La\nGéométrie, Rabouin (2010) points out that it is\nstill not clear whether Descartes discovered his methods for solution\nusing the techniques that are applied in 1637 (Rabouin 2010, 456). As\nsuch, Rabouin urges us to resist the somewhat standard reading of\nDescartes’ early mathematical works according to which there is\na linear and teleological progression from the 1619 pronouncement of\nan “entirely new science” to the groundbreaking program of\nLa Géométrie (a reading found, for instance, in\nSasaki 2003, especially 156–176). According to Rabouin, it is\nnot until the early 1630s, when Descartes engages with the Pappus\nproblem—what Bos also considers “the crucial\ncatalyst” of Descartes’ mature mathematical researches\n(Bos 2001, 283)—that he returns to his 1619 project to craft a\nnew science of geometry that is grounded on a new classification of\ncurves and problems. Following Rabouin, it is at this point of his\nmathematical career that Descartes more clearly sees just how crucial\nthe interplay of algebraic equations and geometry could be for a\ngeneral program of geometrical problem-solving. \nIn late 1631, the Dutch mathematician Golius urged Descartes to\nconsider the solution to the Pappus problem. Unlike the geometrical\nproblems that occupied Descartes’ early researches, the Pappus\nproblem is a locus problem, i.e., a problem whose solution requires\nconstructing a curve—the “Pappus curve” according to\nBos’s terminology—that includes all the points that\nsatisfy the relationship stated in the problem. Generally speaking,\nthe Pappus Problem begins with a given number of lines, a given number\nof angles, a given ratio, and a given segment, and the task is\nidentify a curve such that all the points on the curve satisfy a\nspecified relation to the given ratio. For instance, in the most basic\ntwo-line Pappus Problem\n (figure 4),\nwe are given two lines \\((L_1, L_2)\\), two angles \\((\\theta_1 ,\n\\theta_2)\\), and a ratio \\(\\beta\\). We designate \\(d_1\\) to be the\noblique distance between a point \\(P\\) and \\(L_1\\) such that \\(P\\)\ncreates \\(\\theta_1\\) with \\(L_1\\), and we designate \\(d_2\\) to be the\noblique distance between a point \\(P\\) in the plane and \\(L_2\\) such\nthat \\(P\\) creates \\(\\theta_2\\) with \\(L_2\\). The problem is to find\nall points \\(P\\) such that \\(d_1 : d_2 = \\beta\\). In this case, all\nthe sought after points \\(P\\) will lie along two straight lines, one\nline to the right of \\(L_1\\) and the other to the left of\n\\(L_1\\). (See\n figure 5\n for Bos’s presentation of the general problem.) Figure 4. A Two line Pappus problem \nIn the Collection, Pappus presents a solution to the three\nand four line versions of the problem (i.e., the versions of the\nproblem in which we begin with three or four given lines and angles)\nas well as Apollonius’s solution to the six-line case, which\nrelies on his theory of conics and the transformation of areas to\nconstruct the locus of points (Pappus, 118–123). However, Pappus\ndoes not treat the general \\((n\\)-line) case, and this is the\nadvance of the solution Descartes achieves in 1632, a solution\npublished in La Géométrie, where he claims\nthat, unlike the ancients, he has found a method to successfully\n“determine, describe, [and] explain the nature of the line\nrequired when the question [of the Pappus Problem] involves a greater\nnumber of lines” (G, 22). And as Descartes reports to Mersenne\nin 1632, he could not have found his general solution without the help\nof algebra: \nI must admit that I took five or six weeks to find the solution [to\nthe Pappus Problem]; and if anyone else discovers it, I will not\nbelieve that he is ignorant of algebra (To Mersenne 5 April 1632; AT\nI, 244; CSMK, 37). Figure 5. The General Pappus Problem (from Bos 2001,Fig. 19.1, 273) \nGiven: a Line \\(L_i\\) in the plane, \\(n\\) angles \\(\\theta_i\\), a\nratio \\(\\beta\\), a line segment \\(a\\). For an point \\(P\\) in plane,\nlet \\(d\\) be the oblique distance between \\(P\\) and \\(L_i\\) such that\n\\(P\\) creates \\(\\theta_i\\) with \\(L_i\\). \nProblem: Find the locus of points \\(P\\) such that the following\nratios are equal to the given ratio \\(\\beta{:}\\) \nIn general, \nAccording to Bos, consideration of the general Pappus Problem\n“provided [Descartes], in 1632, with a new ordered vision of the\nrealm of geometry and it shaped his convictions about the structure\nand the proper methods of geometry” (Bos 2001, 283). The best\nevidence we have of the impact the problem had on Descartes’\napproach to geometry is La Géométrie itself: In\nLa Géométrie, the Pappus problem is given pride\nof place as Descartes details his “geometrical calculus”\nand demonstrates the power of his novel program for solving\ngeometrical problems. It is treated in Book One, as Descartes explains\nhis geometrical analysis, and then again in Book Two, where Descartes\noffers the synthesis, i.e., the geometrical demonstration, of his\nsolution to the Pappus Problem in \\(n\\)-lines, a demonstration\nwhich relies on the famous distinction between “geometric”\nand “mechanical” curves that begins this part of the\nwork. \nBook One of La Géométrie is entitled\n“Problems the construction of which requires only straight lines\nand circles,” and it is in this opening book that Descartes\ndetails his geometrical analysis and describes how geometrical\nproblems are to be explicated algebraically. In this respect, what we\nfind in Book One is similar to the algebraic elaboration of\ngeometrical problems presented by Viète in his 1594\nSupplement of geometry as he explains the stage of exegetics.\nThat said, Descartes’ approach to analysis rests on innovations\nin notation and formalism as well as in the merging of geometry and\narithmetic which move him beyond Viète’s analysis,\nlending some credence to Descartes’ remark to Mersenne that, in\nLa Géométrie, his program for geometry begins\nwhere Viète’s left off (To Mersenne, December 1637, AT I,\n479; CSMK 77–79; See Macbeth 2004 for discussion of the\nrelationship between Viète’s “analytical art”\nand Descartes’ use of analysis in geometry). \nBook One commences with the geometrical interpretation of algebraic\noperations, which, we saw above, Descartes had already explored in the\nearly period of his mathematical research. However, what we are\npresented in 1637 is, as Guicciardini aptly describes, a\n“gigantic innovation” both over Descartes’ previous\nwork and the work of his contemporaries (Guicciardini 2009, 38). On\nthe one hand, Descartes offers a geometrical interpretation of root\nextraction and thus treats five arithmetical operations (as opposed to\nthe four operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and\ndivision that were treated in his early work). On the other hand, and\nmore significantly, his treatment relies on an interpretation of\narithmetical operations according to which these operations are taken\nto be closed operations on line segments. Traditionally, for instance,\nthe product of two segments \\(a \\times b\\) was interpreted as\na rectangle, but for Descartes, the product is interpreted as a\nsegment. This allows Descartes to translate geometrical problems into\nequations (that include products such as \\(a \\times b)\\) and\ntreat each term of the equation as similar in kind. Finally, Descartes\nuses a new exponential notation as he sets forth equations of multiple\nterms in Book One, and this notation, which replaces the traditional\ncossic notation of early modern algebra, allows Descartes to tighten\nthe connection between algebra and geometry, and more specifically,\nbetween the algebraic representation of curves through equations with\nthe geometrical classification and geometrical solution of stated\nproblems (as we will see more clearly below in\n section 3.2). \nWith his new geometrical interpretation of the five basic arithmetical\noperations at his disposal, Descartes proceeds to describes how, in\nthe stage of geometrical analysis, one is to give an algebraic\ninterpretation of a geometrical problem: \nIf, then, we wish to solve any problem, we first suppose the solution\nalready effected, and give names to all the lines that seem needful\nfor its construction,—to those that are unknown as well as to\nthose that are known. Then, making no distinction between unknown and\nunknown lines, we must unravel the difficulty in any way that shows\nmost naturally the relations between these lines, until we find it\npossible to express a single quantity in two ways. This will\nconstitute an equation, since the terms of one of these two\nexpressions are together equal to the terms of the other (G,\n6–9). \nWe notice that the key to Descartes’ analysis is to make no\ndistinction between the known and unknown quantities in the problem:\nBoth kinds of quantities are granted a variable (generally,\n\\(a, b, c\\ldots\\) for known quantities and\n\\(x, y, z\\ldots\\) for unknown quantities),\nand thus, we treat the unknowns as if their values were already found.\nOr, as Descartes puts it, we “suppose the solution already\neffected.” The task then is to reduce the problem to an equation\n(in contemporary terms, to a polynomial equation in two unknowns) that\nexpresses the unknown quantity, or quantities, in terms of the known\nquantities. For instance, take the following\n problem:[5] \nGiven a line segment AB containing point C (see\n figure 6),\n the problem is to produce AB to D such that the product AD\\(\\times\\)DB is\nequal to the square of CD. Let AC \\(= a\\), CB \\(= b\\), and\nBD \\(= x\\), which yields AD \\(= a + b + x\\) and CD \\(= b + x\\). Thus, the problem to find\nBD such that AD\\(\\times\\)DB = (CD)\\(^2\\) is algebraically equivalent to\nfinding \\(x\\) such that: \\((a + b + x)\\times(x) = (b + x)^2\\). Or,\nsolving for \\(x\\), the problem is to find \\(x\\) such that,\ngiven \\(a\\) and \\(b, x = b^2 /\n(a\\)—\\(b)\\). Figure 6.\n \nIn this example, we are dealing with a determinate problem, i.e., a\nproblem to which there are a finite number of solutions, and we can\ntherefore reduce the problem to a single equation that expresses the\nunknown quantity in terms of the known quantities. However, as\nDescartes points out, there are also indeterminate problems that\ninvolve an infinite number of solutions. (Locus problems, such as the\nPappus Problem, are of this sort, because the solution includes the\ninfinitely many points that lie along a curve.) When dealing with an\nindeterminate problem, Descartes instructs us that “we may\narbitrarily choose lines of known length for each unknown line to\nwhich there corresponds no equation” (G, 9), i.e., we are to set\nthe unknown lines as oblique coordinates that have a stated value. We\nthen generate several equations that express the unknown quantities in\nterms of one or more known quantities, and solve the equations\nsimultaneously. This is precisely the approach that Descartes takes as\nhe treats the Pappus Problem in Book One. Figure 7. The Four-Line Pappus Problem in Book One (G, 27) \nDescartes begins with consideration of the problem when we are given\nthree or four lines, which, borrowing from Guicciardini (2009), can be\nstated as follows (see\n figure 7): \nHaving three or four lines given in position, it is required to find\nthe locus of points C from which drawing three or four lines to the\nthree or four lines given in position and making given angles with\neach one of the given lines the following condition holds: the\nrectangle [or product] of two of the three lines so drawn shall bear a\ngiven ratio to the square of the third (if there be only three), or to\nthe rectangle [or product] of the other two (if there be four)\n(Guicciardini 2009, 54; based on G, 22). \nIn Book One, Descartes applies his geometrical analysis to the\nfour-line case of the Pappus problem. He begins by designating two\ngiven line segments (of unknown length) AB and BC as oblique\ncoordinates \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), respectively, such that all\nother lines needed to solve the problem will be expressed in terms of\n\\(x\\) and\n \\(y\\).[6]\n Then, by considering the angles given in the problem and the\nproperties of similar triangles, he generates an algebraic expression\nof the sought after points C in terms of the two unknowns \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\) and the known quantity \\(z\\) (where \\(z\\)\ndesignates the ratio given in the problem) (G, 29–30). \nImportantly, the analytic method that Descartes uses in the four-line\ncase is generalized to apply to the general, \\(n\\)-line version\nof the Pappus Problem. That is, Descartes’ claim is that no\nmatter how many lines and angles are given in the problem, it is\npossible, by means of his analytic method, to express the sought after\npoints C in terms of two unknown quantities (in contemporary terms, to\nreduce the problem to a polynomial equation in two unknowns) (G, 33).\nAs a result, for any \\(n\\)-line version of the Pappus Problem, we\ncan generate values for C and construct the sought after Pappus curve\nin a pointwise manner by assigning different values to \\(x\\) and\n\\(y\\). As Descartes puts it, \nFurthermore, to determine the point C, but one condition is needed,\nnamely, that the product of a certain number of lines shall be equal\nto, or (what is quite as simple), shall bear a given ratio to the\nproduct of certain other lines. Since this condition can be expressed\nby a single equation in two unknown quantities, we may give any value\nwe please to either \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) and find the value of the\nother from this equation. It is obvious that when not more than five\nlines are given, the quantity \\(x\\), which is not used to express\nthe first of the lines can never be of degree higher than the\nsecond. \nAssigning a value to \\(y\\), we have \\(x^2 = \\pm ax \\pm b^2\\), and therefore\n\\(x\\) can be found with ruler and compasses, by a method [for\nconstructing roots] already explained. If then we should take\nsuccessively an infinite number of different values for the line\n\\(y\\), we should obtain an infinite number of values for the line\n\\(x\\), and therefore an infinity of different points, such as C,\nby means of which the required curve can be drawn (G, 34). \nThe result of Descartes’ analysis, as indicated by the remarks\nabove, is that the curve that includes the sought after points C can\nbe pointwise constructed by using ruler and compass to solve for the\nroots of a second-degree equation in two unknowns. He then generalizes\nthis result and claims that the solution points for any problem that\ncan be reduced to a second-degree equation can be constructed by ruler\nand compass. If instead a problem is reduced to an equation of third\nor fourth degree, the points are constructed by conics, and if a\nproblem is reduced to an equation of fifth or sixth degree, the points\nare constructed by a curve that is “just one degree higher than\nthe conic sections” (G, 37). In other words, Descartes’\nclaim is that if a problem can be reduced to a single equation of\ndegree not higher than six, in which the unknown quantity or\nquantities are expressed in terms of a known quantity, then the roots\nof the equation can be constructed by straightedge and circle, or by\nconic, or by a more complicated curve that does not have degree higher\nthan four. Based on this result, Descartes suggests a way to\ngeneralize further and solve the \\(n\\)-line Pappus Problem, for\nno matter how many given lines and angles with which a Pappus Problem\nbegins, it will be possible to reduce the problem to an equation and\nthen pointwise construct the roots of the equation, i.e., the sought\nafter points C of the problem (G, 37). \nWhat Descartes achieves here by means of his geometrical analysis is\nno doubt significant. He has outlined a way of solving the Pappus\nProblem for any number of given lines. However, questions about\nproving the Pappus Problem solved still linger come the end of Book\nOne. As in Viète’s analysis, Descartes has shown that a\nsolution to the general problem exists but the algebraic elaboration\nof the problem does not unto itself give a clue to how we are to\ngeometrically construct the curve that solves the problem. Notice in\nparticular that in Book One the roots (i.e., the points along the\nsought after curves) are constructed by straight edge, compass,\nconics, and higher order curves, such that the Pappus curves that\ninclude the roots are constructed pointwise. But this leaves us the\nquestion: Are the Pappus curves of Book One legitimately geometrical?\nThat is, can the curves that solve the \\(n\\)-line version of the\nPappus Problem themselves be constructed by legitimately geometrical\nmethods? This is an issue broached in Book Two, the main focus of\nwhich is how to enact a synthesis, or construction, of a geometrical\nproblem. \nBook Two of La Géométrie is entitled “On\nthe Nature of Curved Lines” and commences with Descartes’\nfamous distinction between “geometric” and\n“mechanical” curves. Given its importance for\nunderstanding the program of La Géométrie as\nwell as the attention this distinction has drawn from commentators, it\nis worth examining the proposals made in the opening pages of Book Two\nwith some care. \nDescartes begins with reference to the ancient classification of\nproblems and offers his interpretation of how ancient mathematicians\ndistinguished curves that could be used in the solution to geometrical\nproblems from those that could not: \nThe ancients were familiar with the fact that the problems of geometry\nmay be divided into three classes, namely, plane, solid, and linear\nproblems. This is equivalent to saying that some problems require only\ncircles and straight lines for their construction, while others\nrequire a conic section and still others more complex curves. I am\nsurprised, however, that they did not go further, and distinguish\nbetween different degrees of those more complex curves, nor do I see\nwhy they called the latter mechanical, rather than geometrical. If we\nsay that they are called mechanical because some sort of instrument\nhas to be used to describe them, then we must, to be consistent,\nreject circles and straight lines, since these cannot be described on\npaper without the use of compasses and a ruler, which may also be\ntermed instruments. It is not because the other instruments, being\nmore complicated than the ruler and compass, are therefore less\naccurate, for if this were so they would have to be excluded from\nmechanics, in which accuracy of construction is even more important\nthan in geometry. In the latter, exactness of reasoning alone is\nsought, and this can surely be as thorough with reference to such\nlines as to simpler ones (G, 40–44). \nDescartes implies that the terms “mechanical” and\n“non-geometrical” were synonymous in ancient mathematics,\neven though it is not at altogether clear that this was the intended\nmeaning of the term “mechanical.” Namely, it is not clear,\ngiven the available textual evidence, that the classification of\ncurves into “geometrical” and “mechanical” was\nintended to serve as a normative claim concerning the legitimacy of a\ncurve’s use in geometrical problem-solving. It could just as\neasily be read as a descriptive moniker that captures the different\nways in which curves were constructed (see Molland 1976 on this issue;\nsee\n section 2.2\n above for Descartes’ blending of the descriptive and the\nnormative in his 1619 proposal for a “new science” of\ngeometry). \nDescartes’ reading of the ancients aside, what’s important\nfor understanding his own peculiar interpretation of geometrical\ncurves is the distinction he draws between the “accuracy of\nconstruction” of a curve, which he renders an issue for\nmechanics, and the “exactness of reasoning,” which he\ndeems as the sole requirement for accepting a curve as legitimately\ngeometrical. In making this claim, Descartes is carving out a unique\nplace for his notion of geometrical curves: He abandons the\n“accuracy of construction” criterion that Clavius adopted\nin his early works to render a curve acceptable in geometrical\nproblem-solving and also the claim forwarded by Viète that\ninstrumentally-constructed curves were not to be considered\ngeometrical (see\n section 1.1\n above). As Descartes’ presentation implies, both these sorts of\ncriteria confuse issues of mechanics with the “exactness of\nreasoning” that is the sole concern of geometry. Thus, as Book\nTwo continues, Descartes reiterates that to determine the geometrical\nstatus of a curve we must lay our focus on issues of exact and clear\nreasoning and, specifically, on the question of whether a curve can be\nconstructed by exact and clear motions. After presenting the\npostulate that “two or more lines can be moved, one upon the\nother, determining by their intersection other curves,”\nDescartes explains, \nIt is true that the conic sections were never freely received into\nancient geometry, and I do not care to undertake to change names\nconfirmed by usage; nevertheless, it seems very clear to me that if we\nmake the usual assumption that geometry is precise and exact, while\nmechanics is not; and if we think of geometry as the science which\nfurnishes a general knowledge of the measurement of all bodies, then\nwe have no more right to exclude the more complex curves than the\nsimpler ones, provided they can be conceived of as described by a\ncontinuous motion or by several successive motions, each motion being\ncompletely determined by those which precede; for in this way an exact\nknowledge of the magnitude of each is always obtainable (G, 43). \nWe see in these remarks that the precision and exactness of geometry\nis intimately tied with the geometer’s consideration of motions\nthat can be precisely and exactly traced. Namely, the geometer is\njustified in using simple curves as well as more complex curves, so\nlong as the construction of these curves proceeds by “precise\nand exact” motions. Descartes clarifies how a complex curve\n“can be conceived of as described by a continuous motion or by\nseveral successive motions, each motion being completely determined by\nthose which precede” by presenting the mesolabe compass that he\nfirst developed in 1619: \nConsider the lines AB, AD, AF, and so forth, which we may suppose to\nbe described by means of the instrument YZ\n [Figure 8].\n This instrument consists of several rulers hinged together in such a\nway that YZ being placed along the line AN the angle XYZ can be\nincreased or decreased in size, and when its sides are together, the\npoints B, C, D, E, F, G, H, all coincide with A; but as the size of\nthe angle is increased, the ruler BC, fastened at right angles to XY\nat the point B, pushed toward Z the ruler CD which slides along YZ\nalways at right angles. In a like manner, CD pushes DE which slides\nalong YX always parallel to BC; DE pushes EF; EF pushes FG; FG pushes\nGH, and so on. Thus we may imagine an infinity of rulers, each pushing\nanother, half of them making equal angles with YX and the rest with\nYZ. \nNow as the angle XYZ is increased, the point B describes the curve AB,\nwhich is a circle; while the intersections of the other rulers,\nnamely, the points D, F, H describe the other curves, AD, AF, AH, of\nwhich the latter are more complex than the first and this more complex\nthan the circle. Nevertheless I see no reason why the description of\nthe first cannot be conceived as clearly and distinctly as that of the\ncircle, or at least as that of the conic sections; or why that of the\nsecond, third, or any other that can be thus described, cannot be as\nclearly conceived of as the first: and therefore I see no reason why\nthey should not be used in the same way in the solution of geometric\nproblems (G,\n 44–47).[7] Figure 8. Mesolabe \nA couple points are worth emphasizing. First, Descartes presents the\nmore complex curves generated by his compass as described by motions\nthat can be as “conceived as clearly and distinctly” as\nthe motions required to construct the more simple circle. And because\nof the clear and distinct motions needed for their construction, these\ncurves are legitimately geometrical. That is, consistent with\nDescartes’ general criterion for constructing geometrical\ncurves, these complex curves can be used in the solution of geometric\nproblems. Second, we see that although Descartes takes care to\ndistinguish the concerns of geometry from those of mechanics, he does\nnot steer away from the construction of curves by means of\ninstruments. Although instrumental constructions are mechanical\nconstructions, they can nonetheless give rise to geometrical curves\nprecisely because the motions of the instruments are\n“clearly and distinctly” conceived. That the motions are\ngenerated by instruments does not render the resultant curve\nnon-geometrical. (For more on the use of instruments in La\nGéométrie, see Bos 1981.) \nIn a similar vein, curves that are non-geometrical by Descartes’\nstandard are curves that require more complicated, less clear and\ndistinct motions for their construction. He explains: \nProbably the real explanation of the refusal of ancient geometers to\naccept curves more complex than the conic sections lies in the fact\nthat the first curves to which their attention was attracted happened\nto be the spiral, the quadratrix, and similar curves, which really do\nbelong only to mechanics, and are not among the curves that I think\nshould be included here, since they must be conceived of as described\nby two separate movements whose relation does not admit of exact\ndetermination (G, 44). \nDescartes explicitly names the spiral and quadratrix as those curves\nwhose construction “must be conceived of as described by two\nseparate movements whose relation does not admit of exact\ndetermination.” Later in Book Two he clarifies why such\ndescriptions fail to be clearly and distinctly conceived: \ngeometry should not include lines that are like strings, in that they\nare sometimes straight and sometimes curved, since the ratios between\nstraight and curved lines are not known, and I believe cannot be\ndiscovered by human minds, and therefore no conclusion based upon such\nratios can be accepted as rigorous and exact (G, 91). \nGiven these remarks, the fundamental problem with the spiral, the\nquadratrix, and “lines that are like strings” is that\ntheir construction requires consideration of the ratio, or relation,\nbetween a circle and straight line. Consider the spiral. As we saw\nabove, its construction involves two uniform motions, namely, the\nuniform rectilinear motion of a point along a segment and the uniform\ncircular motion of the segment around a point. These two motions must\nsimultaneously be considered in order for the moving point’s\npath to describe the spiral, and this, for Descartes, is what is\nultimately problematic. The human mind can think about simultaneous\nrectilinear and circular motions, but it cannot do so with the clarity\nand distinctness required to meet the exact and rigorous standards of\ngeometry. (This claim is not without its problems, which will be\ndiscussed in\n section 3.3\n below. For a comparison between Descartes’ criterion for the\nconstruction of geometrical curves and the views put forward by\nPascal, see Jesseph 2007.) \nAfter presenting his construction criterion for geometrical curves,\nDescartes develops his novel connection between geometrical\nconstruction and the algebraic representation of these curves. Whereas\nin Book One Descartes details how to use algebra to establish that a\nsolution a geometrical problem exists, here, in Book Two, Descartes\nproposes a stronger connection between algebra and geometry and\nfamously claims that any legitimately geometrical curve can be\nrepresented by an equation: \nI could give here several other ways of tracing and conceiving a\nseries of curved lines, each curve more complex than any preceding\none, but I think the best way to group together all such curves and\nthen classify them in order, is by recognizing the fact that all the\npoints of those curves which we may call “geometric,” that\nis, those which admit of precise and exact measurement, must bear a\ndefinite relation to all points of a straight line, and that this\nrelation must be expressed means of a single equation (G, 48). \nHe then proceeds to classify these “geometric” curves\naccording to the degree of their corresponding equations,\nclaiming: \nIf [a curve’s] equation contains no term of higher degree than\nthe rectangle [product] of two unknown quantities, or the square of\none, the curve belongs to the first and simplest class, which contains\nonly the circle, the parabola, the hyperbola, and the ellipse; but\nwhen the equation contains one or more terms of the third or fourth\ndegree, in one or both of the two unknown quantities (for it requires\ntwo unknown quantities to express the relation between two points) the\ncurve belongs to the second class; and if the equation contains a term\nof the fifth or sixth degree in either or both of the unknown\nquantities the curve belongs to the third class, and so on\nindefinitely (G, 48). \nThe same point is made later in Book Two, where Descartes emphasizes\nthat “no matter how we conceive a curve to be described,\nprovided it be one of those which I have called geometric,” it\nwill always be possible to find an equation determining all of the\ncurve’s points (G, 56). He reiterates that geometric curves can\nbe classified according to their equations but also points out that\nwithin a specific class, a curves’ simplicity should be ranked\naccording to the motions required for construction. For instance,\nalthough the circle belongs to the same class as the ellipse,\nhyperbola, and parabola, these latter curves are “equally\ncomplex” whereas the circle “is evidently a simpler\ncurve” and will thus be more useful in the construction of\nproblems (G, 56). (See Manders 2008, 77, for discussion of\nLeibniz’s and Poncelet’s dissatisfaction with the\nconnection between the algebraic form that Descartes uses to represent\ngeometrical curves and the spatial, diagrammatic representation of\nthese curves.) \nAs in Book One, Descartes uses the Pappus Problem to illustrate the\npower of his geometrical calculus, where in Book Two, his aim is to\nshow how his algebraic classification of curves makes it easy\n“to demonstrate the solution which [he has] already given of the\nproblem of Pappus” (G, 59). The specific goal here is to\nestablish that the curves which solve the general Pappus Problem are\nlegitimately geometrical curves, i.e., to show that the Pappus curves\nmeet the exact and rigorous standards of geometrical construction that\nhe has just laid out. Descartes’ discussion of the Pappus\nProblem in Book Two begins as follows: \nHaving now made a general classification of curves, it is easy for me\nto demonstrate the solution which I have already given of the problem\nof Pappus. For, first, I have shown [in Book One] that when there are\nonly three or four lines the equation which serves to determine the\nrequired points is of the second degree. It follows that the curve\ncontaining these points [i.e., the Pappus curve] must belong to the\nfirst class, since such an equation expresses the relation between all\npoints of curves of Class I and all points of a fixed straight line.\nWhen there are not more than eight given lines the equation is at most\na biquadratic, and therefore the resulting [Pappus] curve belongs to\nClass II or Class I. When there are not more than twelve given lines,\nthe equation is of the sixth degree or lower, and therefore the\nrequired curve belongs to Class III or a lower class, and so on for\nother cases (G, 59). \nAs indicated in the passage above, Descartes establishes in Book Two\nthat Pappus curves fall into the specified classes of geometric curves\nhe has designated, where the class into which a Pappus curve falls\ndepends on the number of lines given in the problem and thus, on the\ndegree of the equation to which the problem is reduced. For instance,\nwhen Descartes treats the four-line Pappus Problem in Book Two, he\nshows that, by varying the coefficients of the second degree equation\nto which the problem has been reduced (through the analysis of Book\nOne), we can construct either a circle, parabola, hyperbola, or\nellipse (G, 59–80). That is, he shows that the Pappus curve that\nsolves the four-line problem is either a circle or one of the conic\nsections, the very “geometric” curves that he has grouped\ninto Class I. \nIn two stages, then, Descartes has demonstrated the solution to the\ngeneral Pappus Problem. In Book One he offers his algebraic analysis\nof the problem, and in Book Two he claims to provide the synthesis (or\ndemonstration) that the curves that solve the general problem are\nlegitimately geometrical curves which meet his stated standard for\ngeometrical exactness and precision. And with these two stages\ncompleted, Descartes claims to Mersenne six months after La\nGéométrie is published that his treatment of the\ngeneral Pappus Problem is proof that his new method for\ngeometrical-problem solving is an improvement over the methods of his\npredecessors: \nI do not like to have to speak well of myself, but because there are\nfew people who are able to understand my Geometry, and since\nyou will want me to tell you what my own view of it is, I think it\nappropriate that I should tell you that it is such that I could not\nwish to improve it. In the Optics and the\nMeteorology I merely tried to show that my method is better\nthan the usual one; in my Geometry, however, I claim to have\ndemonstrated this. Right at the beginning I solve a problem which\naccording to the testimony of Pappus none of the ancients managed to\nsolve; and it can be said that none of the moderns has been able to\nsolve it either, since none of them has written about it, even though\nthe cleverest of them have tried to solve the other problems which\nPappus mentions in the same place as having been tackled by the\nancients (To Mersenne, end of December 1637; AT 1, 478; CSMK,\n77–78). \nAs great as Descartes’ confidence in his solution to the Pappus\nProblem, there are questions that surround his synthesis of the\ngeneral problem in Book Two. \nAs indicated above, Descartes attempts to establish via his synthesis\nthat the curves that solve the Pappus Problem are\n“geometric” by his own stated standard, that is, that the\nPappus curves are constructible by the “precise and exact”\nmotions needed to construct genuinely geometric curves. However, it is\nnot at all clear that Descartes has proven this point. Even when\naddressing the basic four-line Pappus Problem in Book Two, Descartes\ndoes not appeal to motions that are evidently clear and distinct as he\nconstructs the Pappus curves that solve the problem (in this case, the\ncircle, parabola, hyperbola, and ellipse). Rather, he relies on\nApollonius’s theory of conics, which requires that a cone be cut\nat a designated point in the plane, and as Bos remarks, this\nApollonian technique for constructing conics “is not a method of\nconstruction that immediately presents itself to the mind as clear and\ndistinct” (Bos 2001, 325). Specifically, since it was not\nevident to mathematicians at the time whether constructions that\nrequired locating a cone in the plane met the exact and rigorous\nstandards of geometrical reasoning, Descartes’ treatment of the\nPappus curves in this four-line case does not convincingly demonstrate\ntheir “geometric” status. Later in Book Two, when he\ntreats the five-line Pappus Problem, matters get more complicated. \nRecall that in addition to his emphasis on the “precise and\nexact” motions that can be used to describe legitimately\ngeometrical curves, Descartes also claims that these curves “can\nbe conceived of as described by a continuous motion or by several\nsuccessive motions.” As such, we would reasonably expect that\nthe geometrical construction of these curves should not proceed\npointwise in the manner of Book One, where Descartes constructed the\nPappus curves by solving the equations to which the problem had been\nreduced. However, when Descartes treats the five-line Pappus Problem\nin Book Two, he in fact offers a pointwise construction of the Pappus\ncurve. He then remarks that the pointwise construction of this\n“geometric” Pappus curve is importantly different from the\npointwise construction of non-geometrical, “mechanical”\ncurves: \nIt is worthy of note that there is a great difference between this\nmethod in which the [Pappus] curve is traced by finding several points\nupon it, and that used for the spiral and similar curves. In the\nlatter, not any point of the required curve may be found at pleasure,\nbut only such points as can be determined by a process simpler than\nthat required for the composition of the curve…On the other\nhand, there is no point on these [“geometric”] curves\nwhich supplies a solution for the proposed problem that cannot be\ndetermined by the method I have given (G, 88–91). \nThe suggestion from Descartes is that when we pointwise construct a\ngeometric curve, we can identify any possible point on the curve, and\nimmediately after the above remarks, he proceeds to equate curves\nconstructed in this manner with curves that could possibly be\nconstructed by continuous motions: “this method of tracing a\ncurve by determining a number of its points taken at random applies\nonly to curves that can be generated by a regular and continuous\nmotion” (G, 91). \nThis distinction between the pointwise construction of\n“geometric” and “mechanical” curves serves two\nrather important purposes in the program of La\nGéométrie: (1) Descartes can establish that the\nPappus curves he has pointwise constructed are in fact\n“geometrical” and thereby complete his synthesis (or\ndemonstration) of the general Pappus Problem, and (2) he can maintain\na boundary between intelligible “geometric” curves and\nunintelligible “mechanical” curves. Without a clear\nindication of why the pointwise construction of a Pappus curve is\n“geometric,” Descartes would have to allow\n“mechanical” curves such as the spiral and quadratrix into\nthe domain of geometrical curves, since these curves can also be\npointwise constructed. Recall for instance Clavius’s pointwise\nconstruction of the quadratrix. According to Clavius’s\ndescription, we begin with a quadrant of a circle and then identify\nthe points of intersection between segments that bisect the quadrant\nand segments that bisect the arc of the quadrant (see\n figure 9).\n That is, we identify the several intersecting points of segments\nwhich are constructible by straightedge and compass, and then, to\ngenerate the quadratrix, we connect the intersecting points, which are\nevenly spaced along the sought after curve. Why is such a pointwise\nconstruction not “geometric”? Because, according to\nDescartes, if we proceed as Clavius does, “not any point of the\nrequired curve may be found at pleasure.” Specifically, given\nthe restrictions of Euclidean construction, we are only able to divide\nthe given arc into \\(2^n\\) parts. As such, what\nDescartes suggests is that it is not possible to divide the arc any\nway we please, and we cannot therefore locate any arbitrary point\nalong the curve by use of pointwise construction. In the case of the\n“geometric” curves, however, we can find any arbitrary\npoint on the curve by appeal to the equations corresponding to the\nproblem; or borrowing Bos’s terminology, Descartes is claiming\nthat “geometric” curves, and the Pappus curves in\nparticular, can be generated by “generic” pointwise\nconstructions. Figure 9. \nWhile consideration of Clavius’s construction of the quadratrix\noffers some reason to accept Descartes’ distinction between the\ndifferent sorts of pointwise constructions, there remains the\ncontroversial claim that curves described by “generic”\npointwise constructions are curves that can be constructed by\ncontinuous motion. This identification allows Descartes to establish\nPappus curves as “geometric” curves, but he offers no\nproof of the identity, and thus, there is question of whether\nDescartes has in fact demonstrated that the Pappus curves are\n“geometric” by his own standards. (See Grosholz 1991 and\nDomski 2009 for alternative ways of addressing this tension.) \nThere is a further question surrounding Descartes’ criterion for\n“geometric” curves. As we have seen above,\nDescartes’ explicit concern in Book Two is to offer a standard\nfor geometrical curves that is bound with intelligible, clear and\ndistinct motions needed for their construction. However, Mancosu\n(2007) offers a compelling case that behind Descartes’ explicit\nremarks in La Géométrie lies a more fundamental\nconcern: To ensure that those curves mathematicians had used to square\nthe circle, such as the spiral and quadratrix which are explicitly\nmentioned in Book Two, are rendered non-geometrical. Mancosu supports\nhis case with evidence from Descartes’ correspondence that\nshows, for Descartes, it is in fact possible in some instances to\nclearly and distinctly conceive the relation between a straight line\nand a circle, a relation he had considered inexact in La\nGéométrie. Namely, in a 1638 letter to Mersenne,\nDescartes writes, \nYou ask me if I think that a sphere which rotates on a plane describes\na line equal to its circumference, to which I simply reply yes,\naccording to one of the maxims I have written down, that is that\nwhatever we conceive clearly and distinctly is true. For I conceive\nquite well that the same line can be sometimes straight and sometimes\ncurved, like a string (To Mersenne, 27 May 1638; AT 2, 140–141;\ntranslation from Mancosu 2007, 118). \nIn La Géométrie, the relation between straight\nand curves lines was considered inexact because, as Descartes put it,\n“the ratios between straight and curved lines are not known, and\nI believe cannot be discovered by human minds” (G, 91). That\nDescartes later admits that he can clearly and distinctly conceive\nsuch a relation suggests, according to Mancosu, that the stated\ncriteria for geometrical curves presented in La\nGéométrie reveals only part of Descartes’\nmathematical agenda. A more complete portrait must, Mancosu argues,\ntake into account Descartes’ commitment to the impossibility of\nsquaring the circle (see Descartes’ letter to Mersenne, 13\nNovember 1629, AT 1, 70–71; translated in Mancosu 2007, 120; see\nalso Mancosu and Arana 2010 for further evidence in support of the\nposition of Mancosu 2007). \nWhether Descartes had the hidden agenda that Mancosu suggests, the\nexplicit claims used to define the program of problem-solving\npresented in La Géométrie point to the\nlimitations of Descartes’ mathematics. As we have seen above,\nDescartes’ primary focus is on a standard for geometry’s\n“exactness of reasoning” that is bound to clear and\ndistinct motions for construction and to the finite equations to\nrepresent curves so constructed. Consequently, there is no room in the\nprogram of La Géométrie to use infinitesimal in\nthe construction of curves or to treat curves represented by infinite\nequations. As such, Descartes eliminated from his geometrical program\nthe very elements of mathematical and geometrical reasoning that made\nit possible for Newton and Leibniz to develop the calculus come the\nlate seventeenth century. Nonetheless, given how quickly Descartes\nhoned his mathematical skills and how quickly he developed his\ninnovative program for geometry, it would not be too risky to accept\nDescartes’ self-assessment and maintain some confidence that the\ncalculus would have been in his reach had he considered the\ninfinitesimal and the infinite: \nhaving determined as I did [in La Géométrie]\nall that could be achieved in each type of problem and shown the way\nto do it, I claim that people should not only believe that I have\naccomplished more than my predecessors but should also be convinced\nthat posterity will never discover anything in this subject which I\ncould not have discovered just as well if I had bothered to look for\nit (To Mersenne, end of December 1637; AT 1, 478; CSMK,\n78–79).","contact.mail":"mdomski@unm.edu","contact.domain":"unm.edu"}]
