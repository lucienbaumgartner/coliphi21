This judgment largely turns on the intrinsic quality\nof his ideas (of which this article will try to give some impression).\nBut another aspect of it is his intellectual influence. This has been\nimmense both within philosophy and beyond it (much greater than is\nusually realized). For example, Hegel’s philosophy turns out to\nbe largely a sort of elaborate systematic development of\nHerder’s ideas (especially concerning language, the mind,\nhistory, and God); so too does Schleiermacher’s (concerning\nlanguage, interpretation, translation, the mind, art, and God);\nNietzsche is deeply influenced by Herder as well (concerning language,\nthe mind, history, and values); so too is Dilthey (especially\nconcerning history); even John Stuart Mill has important debts to\nHerder (in political philosophy); and beyond philosophy, Goethe was\ntransformed from being merely a clever but rather conventional poet\ninto the great artist he eventually became largely through the early\nimpact on him of Herder’s ideas.\n\n\nIndeed, Herder can claim to have virtually established whole\ndisciplines that we now take for granted. For example, it was\nmainly Herder (not, as has often been claimed, Hamann) who established\nfundamental ideas concerning an intimate dependence of thought on\nlanguage that underpin modern philosophy of language. It was Herder\nwho, through those same ideas, his recognition of deep variations in\nthought and language across historical periods and cultures, his\nperception of the fundamental role of grammar in language and of\ngrammar’s deep variation between languages, his empirical\napproach to languages, and in other ways, inspired Friedrich Schlegel,\nWilhelm von Humboldt, and others to found modern linguistics. It was\nHerder who developed modern interpretation-theory, or\n“hermeneutics”, in ways that would subsequently be taken\nover by Schleiermacher and then more systematically formulated by the\nlatter’s pupil August Boeckh. It was Herder who, by doing so,\nalso contributed to establishing the methodological foundations of\nnineteenth-century German classical scholarship (which rested on the\nSchleiermacher-Boeckh methodology), and hence of modern classical\nscholarship generally. It was Herder who did more than anyone else to\nestablish the general conception and the interpretive methodology of\nour modern discipline of anthropology. Finally, Herder also made vital\ncontributions to the progress of modern biblical scholarship.\n\nJohann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803) was born in Mohrungen in\nEast Prussia. His father was a schoolteacher and he grew up in humble\ncircumstances. In 1762 he enrolled at the University of\nKönigsberg, where he studied with Kant, who accorded him special\nprivileges because of his unusual intellectual abilities. At this\nperiod he also began a lifelong friendship with the irrationalist\nphilosopher Hamann. In 1764 he left Königsberg to take up a\nschool-teaching position in Riga. There he wrote the programmatic\nessay How Philosophy Can Become More Universal and Useful for the\nBenefit of the People (1765); published his first major work,\nconcerning the philosophy of language and literature, the\nFragments on Recent German Literature (1767–8); and\nalso published an important work on aesthetics, the Critical\nForests (1769). In 1769 he resigned his position and\ntravelled—first to France, and then to Strasbourg, where in 1770\nhe met, and had a powerful impact on, the young Goethe. In 1771 he won\na prize from the Berlin Academy for his best-known work in the\nphilosophy of language, the Treatise on the Origin of\nLanguage (published in 1772). From 1771–6 he served as\ncourt preacher to the ruling house in Bückeburg. The most\nimportant works from this period are the essay Shakespeare\n(1773) and his first major essay on the philosophy of history,\nThis Too a Philosophy of History for the Formation of\nHumanity (1774). In 1776, partly thanks to Goethe’s\ninfluence, he was appointed General Superintendent of the Lutheran\nclergy in Weimar, a post he would keep for the rest of his life.\nDuring this period he published an important essay in the philosophy\nof mind, On the Cognition and Sensation of the Human Soul\n(1778); a seminal work on the Old Testament, On the Spirit of\nHebrew Poetry (1782–3); his well-known longer work on the\nphilosophy of history, the Ideas for the Philosophy of History of\nHumanity (1784–91); an influential essay on the philosophy\nof religion, God: Some Conversations (1787); a work largely\non political philosophy, written in response to the French Revolution,\nthe Letters for the Advancement of Humanity (1793–7); a\nseries of Christian Writings (1794–8) concerned with\nthe New Testament; and two works opposing Kant’s critical\nphilosophy, A Metacritique on the Critique of Pure Reason\n(1799) (directed against the theoretical philosophy of the\nCritique of Pure Reason (Kant 1781/7)) and the\nCalligone (1800) (directed against the aesthetics of the\nCritique of the Power of Judgment (Kant 1790)). In addition to the works\njust mentioned, Herder also wrote many others in the course of his\ncareer. \nHerder’s earlier works are often his best. He himself wrote in\nOn the Cognition and Sensation (this article will use such\nabbreviated titles throughout) that “the first uninhibited work\nof an author is … usually his best; his bloom is unfolding, his\nsoul still dawn” (HPW 219). Whether or not that\nis generally true, it does arguably apply to Herder\nhimself. \nIn certain ways Herder’s philosophical texts are easier to read\nthan others from the period. For example, he avoids technical jargon,\nwrites in a way that is lively and rich in examples rather than dry\nand abstract, and has no large, complex system for the reader to keep\ntrack of. But his texts also have certain peculiarities that can\nimpede a proper understanding and appreciation of his thought, and it\nis important to be alerted to these. \nTo begin with, Herder’s writing often seems emotional and\ngrammatically undisciplined in ways that might perhaps be expected in\ncasual speech but not in philosophical texts. This is intentional.\nIndeed, Herder sometimes deliberately “roughed up”\nmaterial in this direction between drafts. Moreover, he has serious\nphilosophical reasons for writing in such a way, including the\nfollowing: (1) This promises to make his writing more broadly\naccessible and interesting to people—a decidedly non-trivial\ngoal for him, since he believes it to be an essential part of\nphilosophy’s vocation to have a broad social impact. (2) He\nbelieves in the expressive superiority of speech over writing. (3) One\nof his central theses in the philosophy of mind holds that thought is\nnot and should not be separate from volition, or affect, that types of\nthinking that attempt to exclude affect are inherently distorting and\ninferior. Standard academic writing has this vice, whereas spontaneous\nspeech, and writing that imitates it, do not. (4) Herder is opposed to\nany lexical or grammatical straitjacketing of language, any slavish\nobedience to dictionaries and grammar books. In his view, such\nstraitjacketing is inimical, not only to linguistic creativity and\ninventiveness, but also (much worse), since thought is essentially\ndependent on and confined in its scope by language, thereby to\ncreativity and inventiveness in thought itself. \nAnother peculiarity of Herder’s philosophical texts is their\nunsystematic nature. This is again deliberate. For Herder is\nlargely hostile toward systematicity in philosophy (a fact that is\nreflected both in explicit remarks and in many of his titles:\nFragments … , Ideas … , etc.). He is\nparticularly hostile to the ambitious sort of systematicity that is\naspired to in the tradition of Spinoza, Wolff, Kant, Fichte,\nSchelling, and Hegel: the ideal of a comprehensive theory whose parts\ndisplay some sort of strict overall pattern of derivation. He has\ncompelling reasons for this hostility: (1) He is very skeptical that\nsuch systematic designs can be made to work (as opposed to creating,\nthrough illicit means, an illusion that they do). (2) He\nbelieves that such system-building leads to a premature closure of\ninquiry, and in particular to a disregarding or distortion of new\nempirical evidence. Scrutiny of such systems amply bears out both of\nthese concerns. Herder’s well-grounded hostility to this type of\nsystematicity established an important counter-tradition in German\nphilosophy (which subsequently included, for example, Friedrich\nSchlegel, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, and Adorno). \nOn the other hand, Herder is in favor of\n“systematicity” in a more modest sense: the ideal of a\ntheory that is self-consistent and supported by argument (this marks\nan important point of methodological contrast with Hamann, whom Herder\nalready criticizes for failing to provide arguments in an essay from\nearly 1765, Dithyrambic Rhapsody [G1:38]). He by no\nmeans always achieves this ideal (so that interpreting him calls for\nmore selectivity and reconstruction than is the case with some\nphilosophers). However, his failures to do so are more often apparent\nthan real: First, in many cases where he may seem to be guilty of\ninconsistency he is really not. For he is sometimes developing\nphilosophical dialogues between two or more opposing viewpoints, in\nwhich cases it would clearly be a mistake to accuse him of\ninconsistency in any usual or pejorative sense. And (less obviously)\nin many other cases he is in effect still working in this\ndialogue-mode, only without bothering to distribute the positions\namong different interlocutors explicitly, and so is again innocent of\nreal inconsistency (examples of this occur in How Philosophy Can\nBecome and This Too a Philosophy of History). Moreover,\nhe has serious motives for using this method of (implicit) dialogue:\n(1) Sometimes his main motive is simply that when dealing with\nreligiously or politically delicate matters it permits him to state\nhis views but without quite stating them as his own and therefore\nwithout inviting trouble. But he also has philosophically deeper\nmotives: (2) He takes over from the pre-critical Kant an idea\n(inspired by ancient skepticism) that the best way for a philosopher\nto pursue the truth is by setting contrary views on a subject into\nopposition with one another in order to advance toward, and hopefully\nattain, the truth through their mutual testing and modification. (3)\nIn addition, he develops a more original variant of that idea on the\nsocio-historical plane: analogously, the way for humankind as a whole\nto attain the elusive goal of truth is through an ongoing contest\nbetween opposing positions, in the course of which the best ones will\neventually win out (this idea anticipates and indirectly influenced a\ncentral thesis of John Stuart Mill’s On Liberty\n(1859)). This yields a further motive for the dialogue-method (even\nwhen it does not lead Herder himself to any definite conclusion), in\neffect warranting the rhetorical question, And what does it matter to\nthe cause of humankind and its discovery of truth whether those\nvarious opposing positions are advanced by different people or by\nthe same person? Second, Herder’s frequent appearance\nof neglecting to give arguments is often, rather, a principled\nrejection of arguments of certain sorts. For example, he has\na general commitment to empiricism and against apriorism in philosophy\nthat usually leads him to avoid giving familiar sorts of a priori\narguments in philosophy; and a commitment to sentimentalism in ethics\nthat leads him to refrain from familiar sorts of cognitivist arguments\nin ethics. \nThe extent of Hamann’s influence on Herder’s best thought\nhas been greatly exaggerated by some of the secondary literature\n(e.g., Isaiah Berlin). But Kant’s influence was early,\nfundamental, and enduring. However, the Kant who influenced Herder in\nthis way was the pre-critical Kant of the early and middle\n1760s, not the critical Kant (against whom Herder later engaged in\nthe—rather distracting and ineffective—public polemics of\nthe Metacritique and the Calligone). \nSome of the pre-critical Kant’s key positions in the 1760s,\nsharply contrasting with ones that he would later adopt during the\ncritical period, were: a (Pyrrhonist-influenced) skepticism about\nmetaphysics; a form of empiricism; and a (Hume-influenced)\nsentimentalism in ethics. Herder took over these positions in the\n1760s and retained them throughout his career. It should by no means\nbe assumed that this debt to the early Kant is a debt to a\nphilosophically inferior Kant, though; a good case could be\nmade for the very opposite. \nHerder’s 1765 essay How Philosophy Can Become More Universal\nand Useful for the Benefit of the People is a key text for\nunderstanding both his debt to Kant and the broad orientation of his\nphilosophy. The essay was written under strong influence from Kant,\nespecially, it seems, Kant’s 1766 essay Dreams of a Spirit\nSeer, which Kant sent to Herder prior to its publication\n(“a sheet at a time”, Herder reports [B2:259]). \nHerder’s essay answers a prize question set by a society in\nBern, Switzerland: “How can the truths of philosophy become more\nuniversal and useful for the benefit of the people?” This\nquestion was conceived in the spirit of the\nPopularphilosophie that was competing with school-philosophy\nin the German-speaking world at the time. Kant himself tended to\nidentify with Popularphilosophie at this period, and\nHerder’s selection of this question shows him doing so as well.\nBut in his case the identification would last a lifetime. Philosophy\nshould become relevant and useful for the people as a whole—this\nis a basic ideal of Herder’s philosophy. \nLargely in the service of this ideal, Herder’s essay argues in\nfavor of two sharp turns in philosophy, turns that would again remain\nfundamental throughout the rest of his career. The first turn consists\nin a rejection of traditional metaphysics, and closely follows an\nargument of Kant’s in Dreams of a Spirit Seer.\nHerder’s case is roughly this: (1) Traditional metaphysics,\nthrough undertaking to transcend experience (or strictly speaking, a\nlittle more broadly, “healthy understanding”, which\nincludes, in addition to empirical knowledge, also ordinary morality,\nintuitive logic, and mathematics), succumbs to unresolvable\ncontradictions between its claims, and hence to the Pyrrhonian\nskeptical problem of an equal plausibility on both sides that requires\na suspension of judgment (“I am writing for Pyrrhonists”,\nHerder says [HPW 8]). Moreover (Herder goes on to add in the \nFragments of 1767–8), given the truth of a broadly \nempiricist theory of\nconcepts, much of the terminology of traditional metaphysics turns out\nto lack the basis in experience that is required in order even to be\nmeaningful, and is consequently meaningless (the illusion of\nmeaningfulness arising through the role of language, which\nspins on, creating illusions of meaning, even after the empirical\nconditions of meaning have been left behind). (2) Traditional\nmetaphysics is not only, for these reasons, useless; it is also\nharmful, because it distracts its adherents from the matters\nthat should be their focus: empirical nature and human society. (3) By\ncontrast, empirical knowledge (or strictly speaking, a little more\nbroadly, “healthy understanding”) is free of these\nproblems. Philosophy should therefore be based on and continuous with\nthis. \nHerder’s second sharp turn concerns ethics. Here again he is\nindebted to the pre-critical Kant, but he also goes somewhat further\nbeyond him. Herder’s basic claims are these: (1) Morality is\nfundamentally more a matter of sentiments than of cognitions. (2)\nCognitivist theories of morality—of the sort espoused in this\nperiod by Rationalists such as Wolff, but also by many other\nphilosophers before and since (for example, Plato, the critical Kant,\nand G.E. Moore)—are therefore based on a mistake, and so useless\nas means of moral enlightenment or improvement. (3) But (and here\nHerder’s theory moves beyond Kant’s), worse than that,\nthey are actually harmful to morality, because they weaken\nthe moral sentiments on which morality really rests. In This Too a\nPhilosophy of History and On the Cognition and Sensation\nHerder suggests several reasons why: (a) Abstract theorizing weakens\nsentiments generally, and hence moral sentiments in\nparticular (this is perhaps his least interesting reason). (b) The\ncognitivists’ theories turn out to be so strikingly\nimplausible that they bring morality itself into disrepute, people\nreacting to them roughly along the lines of thinking, If this is the\nbest that even the experts can say in explanation and\njustification of morality, then morality must certainly be a sham, and\nI may as well ignore it and do as I please.  (c) Such theories\ndistract people from recognizing, and working to reinforce, the\nreal foundations of morality: not an imaginary theoretical\ninsight of some sort, but a set of causal mechanisms that inculcate\nand sustain the moral sentiments. (4) More constructively, Herder\naccordingly turns instead to discovering theoretically and promoting\nin practice just such a set of causal mechanisms. In How\nPhilosophy Can Become he mainly emphasizes forms of education and\nan emotive type of preaching in this connection. But elsewhere he\nidentifies and promotes a much broader set of mechanisms as well,\nincluding: the influence of morally exemplary individuals; morally\nrelevant laws; and literature (along with other forms of art).\nLiterature is a special focus of Herder’s theory and practice\nhere. He sees literature as exerting a moral influence in several\nways—for instance, not only through fairly direct moral\ninstruction, but also through the literary perpetuation (or creation)\nof morally exemplary individuals (e.g., Jesus in the New Testament),\nand through the exposure of readers to other people’s inner\nlives and a consequent enhancement of their sympathies for them (a\nmotive that lies behind his epoch-making publication of the\nPopular Songs [Volkslieder] [1774/1778–9], a\ncollection of translations of poems from peoples around the world).\nHerder’s development of this theory and practice of moral\npedagogy was lifelong and tireless. \nThe Treatise On the Origin of Language from 1772 is\nHerder’s best known work in the philosophy of language by far.\nHowever, it is in certain respects both unrepresentative and inferior\nin comparison with other works, such as the Fragments and\nOn the Cognition and Sensation, and should not monopolize\nattention. \nThe Treatise on the Origin is primarily concerned with the\nquestion whether the origin of language can be explained in purely\nnatural, human terms or (as Süßmilch had recently argued)\nonly in terms of a divine source. Herder argues in support of the\nformer position and against the latter. His argument is quite\npersuasive (especially when supplemented on its positive side from the\nFragments). But it will probably not constitute a modern\nphilosopher’s main reason for interest in Herder’s views about\nlanguage – deriving its zest, as it does, from a religious background\nthat is no longer ours. \nOf far greater modern relevance are three interrelated theories that\nHerder develops: a philosophy of language concerning the very nature\nof language, thought, and meaning; a theory of interpretation; and a\ntheory of translation. These theories are found scattered through a\nlarge number of Herder’s works. The following are their main\nfeatures. \nAlready in the mid-1760s—for example, in On Diligence in\nSeveral Learned Languages (1764) and the Fragments\n(1767–8)—Herder began advancing three fundamental theses\nin this area: \nThe first two of these theses dramatically overturned the sort of\ndualistic picture of the relation between language, on the one hand,\nand thought/meaning, on the other, that had predominated during the\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries. They thereby essentially founded\nthe philosophy of language as we still know it today. \nHamann has often been credited with introducing something like these\ntwo revolutionary theses and then passing them on to Herder (e.g., by\nIsaiah Berlin). But that is a mistake; Herder was already committed to\nthem by the mid-1760s, Hamann only later and under Herder’s\ninfluence. \nThe third thesis, quasi-empiricism, would be far less widely accepted\nby philosophers of language today. However, it may well be correct\ntoo. Contrary to first appearances, it need not conflict with thesis\n(2), the equation of meanings with word-usages. And the most likely\nmodern ground for skepticism about it, namely, a\nFregean-Wittgensteinian anti-psychologism concerning meaning that is\npopular today, may well itself be mistaken. \nIn addition to making a fundamental contribution to the philosophy of\nlanguage, these three theses also underpin Herder’s theories of\ninterpretation and translation (as we are about to see). \nHerder’s theories of interpretation and translation both rest on\na certain epoch-making insight of his: Whereas such eminent\nEnlightenment philosopher-historians as Hume and Voltaire had normally\nstill held that, as Hume put it, “mankind are so much the same\nin all times and places that history informs us of nothing new or\nstrange” (1748: section VIII, part I, 65), Herder discovered, or\nat least saw more clearly than anyone before him, that this was false,\nthat peoples from different historical periods and cultures\nvary tremendously in their concepts, beliefs, values,\n(perceptual and affective) sensations, and so forth. He also\nrecognized that similar, albeit usually less dramatic, variations\noccur even between individuals within a single period and\nculture. These positions are prominent in many of Herder’s works\n(see, e.g., On the Change of Taste [1766], This Too a\nPhilosophy of History, and On the Cognition and\nSensation). Let us call them together his principle\nof radical mental difference. \nGiven this principle, and the gulf that consequently often\ninitially divides an interpreter’s own thought from that of the\nperson whom he wants to interpret, interpretation is often an\nextremely difficult task, requiring extraordinary efforts on\nthe part of the interpreter. (See in this connection, e.g.,\nHerder’s discussion of interpreting ancient Hebrew in\nTreatise on the Origin.) \nIn particular, the interpreter often faces, and needs to resist, a\ntemptation falsely to assimilate the thought that he is\ninterpreting to someone else’s, especially his own. (This theme\nis prominent in This Too a Philosophy of History, for\ninstance.) \nHow, given these challenges, is the interpreter supposed to achieve\naccurate interpretation? Herder’s answer comprises several\npoints: \nHis three theses in the philosophy of language undergird his whole\ntheory of interpretation and entail certain parts of the answer to the\nquestion just raised. It is an implication of his thesis that all\nthought is essentially dependent on and bounded by language that an\ninterpreted subject’s language is in a certain sense bound to be\na reliable indicator of the nature of his thought, so that the\ninterpreter at least need not worry that the interpreted subject might\nbe entertaining ineffable thoughts or thoughts whose character is\nsystematically distorted by his expression of them in language. It is\nan implication of Herder’s thesis that meaning consists in\nword-usage that interpretation essentially and fundamentally requires\npinning down an interpreted subject’s word-usages, and thereby\nhis meanings. Finally, it is an implication of Herder’s\nquasi-empiricist thesis concerning concepts that an\ninterpreter’s understanding of an interpreted subject’s\nconcepts must include some sort of recapturing of their basis in the\ninterpreted subject’s sensations. \nHerder also espouses three further important principles in\ninterpretation-theory that contribute to answering the question raised\nabove: \nA principle of secularism in interpretation: Contrary to\na practice that was still common in Herder’s day in relation to\nthe Bible, the interpretation of texts must never rely on religious\nassumptions or means, even when the texts are sacred ones, but must\ninstead rely only on secular ones. (This principle is already\nprominent in Herder’s writings on biblical interpretation from\nthe 1760s.) \nA principle of generic interpretation. In addition to the\nnature of a work’s meanings, interpretation must also identify\nthe nature of its genre (i.e., roughly, a certain set of\ngeneral purposes and rules that it aspires to realize and conform to).\nAs in the case of meanings, genres vary from age to age, culture to\nculture, and even individual to individual, and the interpreter\ntherefore faces, and needs to resist, constant temptations falsely to\nassimilate a work’s genre to others with which he happens to be\nmore familiar (for example, Shakespearean “tragedy” to\nSophoclean “tragedy”, or vice versa). (This principle is\nalready prominent in the Critical Forests from 1769, but\nfinds its classic statement in the essay Shakespeare from\n1773.) \nA principle of methodological empiricism in\ninterpretation: Interpretation must always be based on, and kept\nfaithful to, exact observations of relevant linguistic (and other)\nevidence. This applies when the interpreter investigates word-usages\nin order to discover meanings (a point that is already prominent in\nthe Fragments); when he makes conjectures about an\nauthor’s psychology (see esp. On Thomas Abbt’s\nWritings [1768]); and when he attempts to pin down a work’s\ngenre, or the purposes and rules that constitute it (see esp.\nShakespeare). \nSo far, these principles will probably seem sensible enough. But\nbeyond them, Herder also advances a further set of interpretive\nprinciples that are likely to sound much more\ntouchy-feely at first hearing (the first of them rather\nliterally so!). However, I want to suggest that they are in fact on\nthe contrary quite hard-nosed. \nHerder proposes (prominently in This Too a Philosophy of\nHistory, for instance) that the way to bridge radical mental\ndifference when interpreting is through Einfühlung,\n“feeling one’s way in”. This proposal has often been\nthought (for example, by Friedrich Meinecke) to mean that the\ninterpreter should perform some sort of psychological self-projection\nonto texts. However, that is not Herder’s main idea\nhere—for making it so would amount to advocating just the sort\nof distorting assimilation of the thought in a text to one’s own\nthat he is above all concerned to avoid. As can be seen from\nThis Too a Philosophy of History, what he mainly has in mind\nis instead an arduous process of historical-philological inquiry.\nWhat, though, more specifically, is the cash value of his metaphor of\nEinfühlung? It has at least five components, which are\nquite various in nature and all quite sensible and deep: (1) First of\nall, the metaphor implies (once again) that the interpreter typically\nfaces a radical difference, a gulf, between his own mentality and that\nof the interpreted subject, making interpretation a difficult,\nlaborious task (it implies that there is an “in” there\nthat the interpreter must carefully and laboriously “feel his\nway into”). (2) The metaphor also implies more specifically\n(This Too a Philosophy of History shows) that the\n“feeling one’s way in” should include thorough\nresearch not only into a text’s use of language but also into\nits whole geographical, historical, and social context. (3) It also\nimplies a claim—based on Herder’s quasi-empiricist theory\nof concepts—that in order to understand an interpreted\nsubject’s language the interpreter must achieve an imaginative\nreproduction of his (perceptual and affective) sensations. (4) It also\nimplies (This Too a Philosophy of History again shows) that\nhostility in an interpreter toward the people whom he interprets will\ngenerally distort his interpretation, and should therefore be avoided.\n(Herder is equally opposed to excessive identification with\nthem for the same reason.) (5) Finally, it also implies that the\ninterpreter should strive to develop his grasp of linguistic usage,\ncontextual facts, and relevant sensations to the point where it\nachieves something like the same immediacy and automaticness that it\nhad for a text’s original author and audience when they\nunderstood the text in light of such factors (so that it acquires for\nhim, as it had for them, the phenomenology more of a feeling\nthan a cognition). \nIn addition, Herder insists (for example, in the Critical\nForests) on a principle of holism in interpretation.\nThis principle rests on several motives, including the following: (1)\nParts of a text taken in isolation are typically ambiguous in various\nways (in relation to background linguistic possibilities). In order to\nresolve such ambiguities, an interpreter needs the guidance provided\nby surrounding text. (2) That problem arises once a range of\npossible linguistic meanings is established for a piece of text. But\nin the case of a text that is separated from the interpreter by\nradical mental difference, knowledge of such a range itself presents a\nproblem. How is he to pin down the range of possible meanings, i.e.,\npossible usages, for a word? This requires a collation of the\nword’s actual uses and an inference from these to the rules that\ngovern them, i.e., to their usages, a collation that in turn requires\nlooking to remoter contexts in which the same word occurs (other parts\nof the text, other works in the author’s corpus, works by his\ncontemporaries, etc.), or in short: holism. (3) Authors typically\nwrite a work as a whole, conveying ideas not only in its\nparticular parts but also through the way in which these fit together\nto make up a whole. Consequently, readings that fail to interpret the\nwork as a whole will miss essential aspects of its meaning—both\nthe ideas in question themselves and meanings of the particular parts\non which they shed important light. \nIn On Thomas Abbt’s Writings, On the Cognition\nand Sensation, and elsewhere Herder makes one of his most\nimportant innovations: interpretation must supplement its focus on\nword-usage with attention to the author’s psychology.\nHerder implies various reasons for this (several of which would\nsubsequently be elaborated more explicitly by successors such as\nSchleiermacher and Friedrich Schlegel): (1) As was already mentioned,\nhe embraces a quasi-empiricist theory of concepts that entails that in\norder to understand an author’s concepts an interpreter must\nimaginatively recapture the author’s relevant sensations. (2) As\nQuentin Skinner has recently emphasized, understanding the linguistic\nmeaning of an utterance or text is only a necessary, not a sufficient,\ncondition for understanding it tout court; in addition, one\nneeds to establish the author’s illocutionary\nintentions. For example, I meet a stranger by a frozen lake\nwho tells me, “The ice is thin over there”; I understand\nhis linguistic meaning perfectly; but is he simply informing me?,\nwarning me?, threatening me?, joking? … (3) Skinner tends to\nimply that one can determine linguistic meanings prior to establishing\nauthorial intentions. That may sometimes be so (e.g., in the\nexample just given). But is it generally? Herder implies not.\nAnd this seems right, because the linguistic meaning of a formula is\noften ambiguous (in terms of the background linguistic possibilities),\nand in order to identify the relevant meaning one must turn, not only\n(as was already mentioned) to larger bodies of text, but also to\nhypotheses, largely derived from them, concerning the author’s\nintentions (e.g., concerning the subject-matter that he intends to\ntreat). This is a further reason why interpreters need to invoke\npsychology. (4) As was already mentioned, Herder implies that an\nauthor often conveys ideas in his work, not explicitly in its parts,\nbut rather via these and the way in which they are put together to\nform a textual whole. It is necessary for the interpreter to capture\nthese ideas, both for their own sake and because doing so is often\nessential for resolving ambiguities at the level of the parts. (5)\nHerder also refers to the second half of his doctrine of radical\nmental difference—individual variations in mode of\nthought even within a single period and culture—as a source of\nthe need for psychological interpretation. Why does any special need\narise here? Part of the answer seems to be that when an interpreter is\ndealing with a concept that is distinctive of a particular author\nrather than common to a whole period/culture, he typically faces a\nproblem of relative paucity and lack of contextual variety in\nthe actual uses of the word that are available as empirical evidence\nfrom which to infer the rule for use, or usage, constitutive of its\nmeaning. Hence he needs extra help—and the author’s\ngeneral psychology may provide this. \nIn On Thomas Abbt’s Writings, On the Cognition and\nSensation, and elsewhere Herder also indicates that\ninterpretation, especially in its psychological aspect, requires the\ninterpreter to use “divination”. This is another principle\nthat is liable to sound disturbingly touchy-feely at first\nhearing—in particular, it can sound as though Herder means some\nsort of prophetic process that has a religious basis and is perhaps\neven infallible. However, what he really has in mind here is instead,\nfar more sensibly, a process of hypothesis, based on the meager\nempirical evidence that is available, but also going well beyond it,\nand therefore vulnerable to subsequent falsification, and abandonment\nor revision if falsified. \nFinally, Herder also implies an additional important point concerning\nthe general nature of interpretation: \nAfter Herder, the question was explicitly raised whether\ninterpretation is a science or an art. Herder does not himself\nexplicitly raise or address this question. But his strong inclination\nwould clearly be to say that interpretation is like rather\nthan unlike natural science. He has several reasons for thinking so:\n(1) He assumes (as indeed did virtually everyone at this period) that\nthe meaning of an author’s text is as much an objective\nmatter as the subjects investigated by the natural scientist. (2) The\ndifficulty of interpretation that results from radical mental\ndifference, and the consequent need for a methodologically\nsophisticated and painstaking approach to interpretation\nin many cases, make for further points of similarity between\ninterpretation and natural science. (3) The essential role of\n“divination”, qua hypothesis, in interpretation\nconstitutes yet a further point of similarity between interpretation\nand natural science. Moreover, (4) even the subject-matter of\ninterpretation is not, in Herder’s view, sharply different from\nthat dealt with by natural science: the latter investigates observable\nphysical processes in nature in order to determine the forces that\nunderlie and produce them, but, similarly, interpretation investigates\nobservable human verbal (and non-verbal) physical behavior in order to\ndetermine the forces that underlie and produce it (Herder\nexplicitly identifying mental conditions, such as conceptual\nunderstanding, as “forces”). \nHerder’s theory of interpretation had an enormous and beneficial\nimpact on subsequent hermeneutics. His theory was taken over almost in\nits entirety by Schleiermacher in his much more famous lectures on\nhermeneutics, delivered during the first third of the nineteenth\ncentury. In particular, such fundamental and famous positions in\nSchleiermacher’s hermeneutics as his supplementing of\n“linguistic” with “psychological”\ninterpretation and his identification of “divination” as\nthe main method of the latter are due entirely to Herder. Moreover,\nwhere Herder and Schleiermacher do occasionally disagree\nconcerning interpretation, Herder’s position almost always turns\nout to be philosophically superior on inspection. \nBy decisively influencing Schleiermacher’s hermeneutic theory\nHerder also exercised an indirect decisive influence on that of\nSchleiermacher’s great pupil August Boeckh, whose\nEncyclopedia and Methodology of the Philological Sciences\n(posthumously published in 1877) essentially\nreproduced Schleiermacher’s theory with only modest\nelaborations, and became the standard methodological work for\nclassical scholars and others. Moreover, Boeckh’s one\nsignificant departure from Schleiermacher’s theory, namely, his\naddition of generic interpretation to the aspects of\ninterpretation that Schleiermacher had already distinguished, in\neffect simply reincorporated the strong emphasis that Herder had\nalready placed on this. \nHerder already in the Fragments of 1767–8 developed an\nimportant new theory of translation that subsequently went on to have\nan enormous and beneficial impact on both the theory and the practice\nof translation in Germany. The following are some of its key\ntheses: \nTranslation (like interpretation) faces a deep challenge due to\nthe phenomenon of radical mental difference. It especially does so\nbecause of the deep differences in concepts that occur between\ndifferent historical periods and cultures, and even to some extent\nbetween individuals within a single period and culture. \nAs a result, translation is in many cases an extremely difficult\nundertaking. \nAgain as a result, translation commonly confronts a choice between\ntwo possible approaches: what Herder calls a “lax”\napproach (i.e., one in which the language and thought of the target\ntext are allowed to diverge rather freely from those of the source\ntext) and an “accommodating” approach (i.e., one in which\nthey are made to conform closely to those of the source text). \nHerder rejects the former approach. He does so largely because it\nfails to achieve the most widely accepted and fundamental goal of\ntranslation: semantic faithfulness. \nHe in particular rejects a certain rationale for it that Dryden\nand others had advocated, namely, that a translation should provide\nthe work that the author would have written had his native\nlanguage not been the one he actually had but instead the target\nlanguage.  Herder objects to this that in cases such as that of\ntranslating Homer, for example, the author could not have\nwritten his work in the modern target language. \nSo Herder urges that the translator should instead err in the\nother direction, toward “accommodating”. \nBut how is this to be achieved? \nOne essential means to achieving it that Herder identifies is that\nthe translator must have interpretive expertise. So Herder\nrequires this. \nAnother, much less obvious, means is a certain vitally important\ntechnique that Herder develops for overcoming conceptual discrepancies\nbetween the source language and the target language. That might seem\nsimply impossible (indeed, some more recent philosophers, such as\nDonald Davidson, have mistakenly assumed that it would be). But Herder, drawing on\nhis novel philosophy of language, finds a solution: Since meanings or\nconcepts are word-usages, in order to reproduce (or at least optimally\napproximate) in the target language a concept from the source language\nthat the target language currently lacks, the translator should take\nthe closest corresponding word from the target language and\n“bend” its usage for the course of the translation in such\na way as to make it mimic the usage of the source word. This technique\nessentially requires that the source word be translated uniformly\nacross its multiple occurrences in a work (and also that the single\ntarget word chosen not be used to translate any other source words).\nSuch an approach is far from being common in translation practice, so\nfar indeed that it is rarely found in translations. However, Herder\nscrupulously uses it in his own translations, as does an important\nsubsequent tradition that has followed him in adopting it (including\nSchleiermacher, Franz Rosenzweig, and Martin Buber). \nHerder is well aware that using this “bending”\napproach will inevitably make for translations that are more difficult\nto read than those that can be produced by a more “lax”\nmethod (e.g., by using multiple words in the target language to\ntranslate a single word in the source language). However, he considers\nthis price well worth paying in order to achieve maximal semantic\naccuracy. \nAnother key means that Herder adopts is to complement the goal of\nsemantic faithfulness with that of faithfulness to the musical\nform of a literary work (e.g., meter, rhyme, alliteration, and\nassonance). As might be expected, his motives for doing this are\npartly extra-semantic: in particular, aesthetic fidelity, and fidelity\nto the exact expression of feelings that is effected by means of a\nliterary work’s musical features. But they are also in part\nsemantic: in his view, musical form and semantic content are strictly\ninseparable, so that fully realizing even the goal of semantic\nfaithfulness in fact requires that a translation also be faithful to\nthe work’s musical form. Why does he believe that musical form\nand semantic content are inseparable in this way? He has two main\nreasons: First, musical forms often carry their own meanings (think,\nfor example, of the humorous and bawdy connotations of the\nmeter/rhyme-scheme of a limerick). Second, as was recently mentioned,\nHerder believes that musical form is essential to an exact expression\nof feelings; but, as we saw earlier, he also thinks that feelings are\ninternal to meanings (this is part of the force of his\nquasi-empiricism in the philosophy of language); so reproducing a\nwork’s musical form in translation turns out to be essential\neven for accurately conveying the meanings of its words and sentences\nin translation. \nIn addition to being necessary in order to achieve\ntranslation’s traditional fundamental goal of exactly\nreproducing meaning (as well as aesthetic fidelity and fidelity in the\nexpression of feelings) as fully as possible, the more\n“accommodating” sort of translation that has been\ndescribed is also necessary, in Herder’s view, in order to\nachieve certain further important goals. One of these lies in a\npotential that translation has for enriching the target language (both\nconceptually and in musical forms). Herder argues convincingly that\nwhereas “lax” translation forgoes this opportunity,\n“accommodating” translation capitalizes on it. \nAnother of these further goals lies in both expressing and\ncultivating in a translation’s readers a cosmopolitan respect\nfor the Other—something that requires that the translation\nreproduce the Other’s meanings and musical forms as accurately\nas possible. \nHerder holds that the preferred “accommodating” sort\nof translation demands that the translator be in a sense a\n“creative genius”, i.e., skilled and creative enough to\nsatisfy the heavy demands that this sort of translation imposes on\nhim, in particular, skilled and creative enough to invent the new\nconceptual and musical forms in the target language that it\nrequires. \nDespite his commitment to the central importance of this sort of\ntranslation (largely, as we have seen, due to its necessity for\nachieving translation’s traditional fundamental goal of\nfaithfully reproducing meaning), Herder is also in the end quite\nliberal about the forms that translation—or interlinguistic\ntransfer more generally, including, for example, what he sometimes\ndistinguishes from “translation\n[Übersetzung]” proper as “imitation\n[Nachbildung]” or “rejuvenation\n[Verjüngung]”—can legitimately take. He\nallows that its possible forms are quite various, and that which one\nis most appropriate in a particular case will largely depend on the\nauthor or genre in question and on the translator’s (or\ntransferer’s) purposes. \nHerder’s theory of translation (as just summarized), together\nwith his demonstration of its viability in practice, for example, in\nhis sample translations of Shakespeare in the Popular Songs,\nhad an enormous and beneficial impact on a whole generation of German\ntranslation theorists and practitioners—including Johann\nHeinrich Voss (the great translator of Homer), August Wilhelm Schlegel\n(an important translation theorist and the great translator of\nShakespeare), Goethe (a significant theorist of translation), Wilhelm\nvon Humboldt (a significant theorist of translation and translator),\nand Schleiermacher (an important theorist of translation and\nGermany’s great translator of the Platonic dialogues).\nHerder’s principle of complementing semantic faithfulness with\nfaithfulness in the reproduction of musical form had an especially\npowerful impact on these successors. His principle of\n“bending” word-usages in order to cope with conceptual\nincommensurabilities was less widely followed, but was adopted by\nSchleiermacher among others. \nHerder’s philosophy of language, interpretation, and translation\nowes significant debts to predecessors—for example, his\nphilosophy of language to Leibniz, Christian Wolff, Spinoza, and\nErnesti, his theory of interpretation again to Spinoza and Ernesti,\nand his theory of translation to Thomas Abbt. However, even his\nborrowings incorporate important refinements, and his overall\ncontribution was enormous. \nHerder’s philosophy of language and interpretation, together\nwith several further philosophical principles that he developed, made\na vitally important contribution to the birth of two whole new\nacademic disciplines that did not yet exist in his day but which we\ntoday take for granted: linguistics and cultural anthropology. (For\nfurther details, see Section 1 of the\n Supplementary Discussion.) \nIn On the Cognition and Sensation from 1778 and elsewhere\nHerder develops a very interesting and influential position in the\nphilosophy of mind. The following are some of its central\nfeatures. \nConcerning the fundamental mind-body problem, Herder tried out various\npositions over the course of his career, but the considered position\nat which he arrived was uncompromisingly naturalistic and\nanti-dualistic. \nIn On the Cognition and Sensation he tries to erase the\ntraditional sharp division between the mental and the physical in two\nspecific ways: First, he advances a theory that minds and mental\nconditions consist in forces [Kräfte] that\nmanifest themselves in people’s bodily behavior—just as\nphysical nature involves forces that manifest themselves in the\nbehavior of bodies. He officially remains agnostic on the question of\nwhat force is, except for conceiving it as something apt to produce a\ntype of bodily behavior, and as a real source thereof (not merely\nsomething reducible thereto). This, strictly speaking, absolves his\ntheory of certain common accusations (for example, H.B. Nisbet and\nFrederick Beiser’s accusation that it is\n“vitalist”). But it also leaves it with enough content to\nhave great virtues over rival theories: (1) The theory ties types of\nmental states conceptually to corresponding types of bodily\nbehavior—which seems correct, and which therefore marks a point\nof superiority over both dualistic theories and mind-brain identity\ntheories. (2) On the other hand, the theory avoids reducing\nmental states to bodily behavior—which again seems correct,\ngiven such obvious facts as that we can be, and indeed often are, in\ntoken mental states that happen to receive no behavioral manifestation\nat all, and which hence constitutes a point of superiority over\nbehaviorist theories. (3) Moreover, Herder’s official\nagnosticism about what (mental) force is can be seen as showing\nrecognition of the important conceptual fact (recently exploited by\nfunctionalists in their “multiple realizability argument”)\nthat although the concepts of mind and mental conditions imply a real\nsource of a type of behavior, they do not imply anything about the\nnature of that source’s constitution. \nSecond, Herder also tries to explain the mind in terms of the\nphenomenon of irritation [Reiz], a phenomenon that\nhad recently been identified by the physiologist Albrecht von Haller,\nand which is paradigmatically exemplified by muscle fibers contracting\nin response to direct physical stimuli and relaxing upon their\nremoval—in other words, a phenomenon which, while basically\nphysiological, also exhibits a transition to mental characteristics.\nThere is an ambiguity in Herder’s position here: Usually, he\nwants to resist physicalist reductionism, and so would be reluctant to\nsay that irritation is purely physiological and fully constitutes\nmental states. However, in the 1775 draft of On the Cognition and\nSensation, and even in parts of the published version, that\nis his position. And from a modern standpoint, this is\narguably a further virtue of his account (though, of course, we would\ntoday want to recast it in terms of different, and much more complex,\nphysiological processes than irritation). \nThis second line of thought might seem at odds with the first one\n(forces). But it need not be. For, given Herder’s official\nagnosticism about what forces are, this second line of thought could,\nso to speak, fill in the “black box” of the hypothesized\nreal forces, namely in physicalist terms. In other words, it turns out\n(not indeed as a conceptual matter, but as a contingent one) that the\nreal forces in question consist in physiological processes. \nHerder’s philosophy of mind also advances another important\nthesis: that the mind is a unity, that there is no sharp\ndivision between its faculties. This thesis contradicted theorists\nsuch as Sulzer and Kant. However, it was not in itself new with\nHerder, having already been espoused by the Rationalists, especially\nWolff (Herder’s introduction to his 1775 draft shows that he is\nfully aware of this debt). Where Herder is more original is in\nrejecting the Rationalists’ reduction of sensation and volition\nto cognition; establishing the unity thesis in an empirical rather\nthan an apriorist way; and adding a normative dimension to\nit—this is not only how the mind is but also how it\nought to be. This last feature might sound incoherent at\nfirst hearing, since if the mind is this way by its very nature, what\nsense can there be in prescribing to people that it should be so\nrather than otherwise? However, Herder’s idea here is rather the\nquite coherent one that, while the mind is indeed this way by its very\nnature, people sometimes behave as though one faculty could be\nabstracted from another, and try to effect such an abstraction, but\nthis then leads to various malfunctions, and should therefore be\navoided. \nHerder’s overall thesis of the mind’s unity rests on four\nmore specific doctrines concerning intimate mutual involvements\nbetween mental faculties, and malfunctions that arise from resisting\nthem, doctrines that are in large part empirically grounded and hence\nlend the overall thesis a sort of empirical basis as well: \nA first doctrine concerns the relation between thought and language:\nNot only does language of its very nature express thought (an\nuncontroversial point), but also (as we noted earlier) for Herder\nthought is essentially dependent on and bounded by language. Herder\nlargely bases this further claim on empirical grounds (for example,\nconcerning how children’s thought develops in step with language\nacquisition). The normative aspect of his position here is that\nattempts (in the manner of some metaphysics, for example) to cut\nthought free from the constraints of language lead to nonsense. \nA second area of intimate mutual involvement concerns cognition and\nvolition, or affects. The claim that volition is and should be based\non cognition is not particularly controversial. But Herder also argues\nthe converse, that all cognition is and should be based on volition,\non affects—and indeed, not only on such relatively anemic\naffects as the impulse to know the truth, but also on much less anemic\nones. He is especially concerned to combat the idea that theoretical\nwork in philosophy or the sciences is or should be detached from\nvolition, from affects. In his view, it never really is even when it\npurports to be, and attempts to make it so merely impoverish and\nweaken it. His grounds for this whole position are again mainly\nempirical in nature. \nA third area of intimate mutual involvement concerns thought and\nsensation. Conceptualization and belief, on the one hand, and\nsensation, on the other, are intimately connected according to Herder.\nThus, he advances the quasi-empiricist theory of concepts that was\nmentioned earlier, which entails that all of our concepts (and hence\nalso all of our beliefs) ultimately depend in one way or another on\nsensation. But conversely, he also argues (anticipating much important\ntwentieth-century work in philosophy) that there is a dependence in\nthe other direction: that the character of an adult human\nbeing’s sensations depends on his concepts and beliefs.\nNormatively, he sees attempts to violate this interdependence as\ninevitably leading to intellectual malfunction—for example, as\nhas already been mentioned, he thinks that metaphysicians’\nattempts to cut entirely free from the empirical origin of our\nconcepts lead to meaninglessness. His grounds for this whole position\nare again largely empirical in character. \nA fourth area of intimate mutual involvement concerns unity among the\nfaculties of sensation themselves. For one thing, Herder implies that\nour underlying animal nature involves a sort of primordial fusion of\nperceptual with affective sensations (albeit that, unlike other\nanimals, we also have a distinctive ability to suspend this fusion, an\nability that he calls Besonnenheit). For another thing, he\nargues that the several faculties of perceptual sensation themselves\nform a sort of unity. His grounds for these two positions are again\nmainly empirical in character. In particular, he says that the unity of the several\nfaculties of perceptual sensation is shown by clues that emerge in\nunusual situations and in pathological cases. Accordingly, he argues,\nfor example, that the dependence of the mature sense of sight on the\nsense of touch is shown both by the way in which the sense of sight\ndevelops in young children and by the way in which it develops after\nmedical operations on previously blind people such as\nCheselden’s blind man. \nIn a further seminal move in the philosophy of mind Herder argues that\nlinguistic meaning is fundamentally social—so that thought and\nother aspects of human mental life (since they are essentially\narticulated in terms of meanings), and therefore even the very self\n(since the self is essentially dependent on thought and other aspects\nof human mental life, and moreover defined in its specific identity by\ntheirs), are so too. Herder’s version of this position seems\nintended only as an empirically based causal claim. It has since\nfathered a long tradition of attempts to generate more ambitious cases\nfor stronger versions of the claim that meaning—and hence also\nthought etc. and the very self—is at bottom socially constituted\n(for example, in Hegel, Wittgenstein, Kripke, Burge, and Brandom).\nHowever, it may well be that these more ambitious cases and versions\ndo not work, and that Herder’s original version is exactly what\nshould be accepted. \nHerder also, in tension though not contradiction with this principle\nof sociality, holds that (even within a single period and culture)\nhuman minds are as a rule deeply individual, deeply different\nfrom each other—so that in addition to a generalizing psychology\nthere is also a need for a psychology oriented to individuality. This\nis an important idea that has strongly influenced many subsequent\ncontinental thinkers (for example, Schleiermacher, Nietzsche, Proust,\nSartre, and Manfred Frank). Herder himself advances it only as an\nempirical rule of thumb. By contrast, a prominent strand in\nSchleiermacher and Frank purports to establish it as an a priori\nuniversal truth. However, Herder’s original version is again\narguably the more plausible one. \nFinally, like predecessors in the Rationalist tradition and Kant,\nHerder sharply rejects the Cartesian idea of the mind’s\nself-transparency—instead insisting that much of what occurs in\nthe mind is unconscious, so that self-knowledge is often deeply\nproblematic. This is another compelling position that has had a strong\ninfluence on subsequent thinkers. \nThis whole Herderian philosophy of mind owes much to predecessors,\nespecially ones in the Rationalist tradition. But it is also in many\nways original. The theory is important in its own right. And it\nexercised an enormous influence on Herder’s successors,\nincluding Hegel, Schleiermacher, and Nietzsche. \nUnlike his teacher Kant, who had little interest in or knowledge of\nliterature or art, and whose treatment of them in the Critique of\nthe Power of Judgment (1790) is correspondingly weak, Herder had a passionate\ninterest in and a deep knowledge of them, and as a result was able to\ndevelop a rich set of original and important ideas about them. In this\nrespect he set a valuable precedent that would be followed in the next\ngeneration by the Romantics (especially Friedrich and August Wilhelm\nSchlegel) and Hegel. \nHerder also anticipated and influenced the Romantics in another\nimportant way. One of the most striking and distinctive positions of\nthe Romantics was a certain valorization of literature and art over\nother areas of culture (such as science, religion, and morality). But\nHerder had already developed such a position before them. First, from\nan early period he argued that song was the origin of all\nlanguage (and consequently also of all thought). Second, in works such\nas the Treatise on the Origin and especially the essay On\nImage, Poetry, and Fable (1787) he argued that all language (and\nconsequently also all thought) is fundamentally figurative or\nmetaphorical in nature—for example, that its grammar typically\nprojects the two genders onto the whole of nature, and that it\npervasively involves a set of creative transitions from an object to a\nsensory stimulus to an individualistically formed image and thence to\nthought and language—and is thus poetic. Third, in\nworks such as his Attempt at a History of Lyric Poetry (1764)\nand On the Spirit of Hebrew Poetry he also argued that poetry\nhas been fundamental to religion from the beginning. And elsewhere he\nargued that non-linguistic art, especially sculpture, has played an\nimportant role in religion from an early period as well. Fourth, he\nalso argued that poetry has a very important function in moral\neducation, indeed one even more important than that of other\nmechanisms of moral education such as laws. \nBesides the aforementioned, what are Herder’s most important\ncontributions to aesthetics? He is skeptical about the sort of\naprioristic and systematic aesthetics that the\ninventor of the discipline of aesthetics, the Rationalist philosopher\nBaumgarten, had recently developed. Instead, he calls for a bottom-up,\nor empirical, approach to the discipline. And his considered\nposition concerning the ideal of an aesthetic system is\ndismissive as well. It is true that he began his career aspiring to\nsomething of the kind and that in the Critical Forests (1769)\nhe accordingly set out to argue for the following little aesthetic\nsystem: whereas music is a mere succession of objects in time, and\nsculpture and painting are merely spatial, poetry has a sense, a soul,\na force; whereas music, sculpture, and painting belong solely to the\nsenses (namely, to hearing, feeling, and vision, respectively), poetry\nnot only depends on the senses but also relates to the imagination;\nwhereas music, sculpture, and painting employ only natural\nsigns, poetry uses voluntary and conventional signs.\nIt is also true that this system was later taken over (with only minor\nmodifications) by Schleiermacher in his aesthetics lectures, and that\nit has sometimes been touted as Herder’s main achievement in\naesthetics more recently (for example, by Robert Norton). But as\nHerder himself quickly came to realize after formulating it, it is a\nnaive system. And his real achievements in aesthetics are other than\nand contrary to it. \nLet us turn to those real achievements, then. One of them concerns the\nrelation between art and language. As we saw earlier, Herder’s\nphilosophy of language is committed to the two doctrines that thought\nis essentially dependent on and bounded by language, and that meaning\nis word-usage. This prompts certain questions. These doctrines make a\nplausible break with a common Enlightenment assumption that thought\nand meaning are in principle autonomous of whatever material,\nperceptible expressions they may happen to receive. Following Charles\nTaylor, we might call such a move one to\n“expressivism”. But what form should expressivism\ntake exactly? Is the dependence of thought and meaning on\nexternal symbols strictly one on language (in the usual sense\nof “language”)? Or is it rather a dependence on a broader\nrange of symbolic media including, besides language, also such things\nas painting, sculpture, and music—so that a person might be able\nto entertain thoughts that he was not able to express in language but\nonly in some other symbolic medium? Let us call the former\nposition narrow expressivism and the latter broad\nexpressivism. \nHamann in his Metacritique espoused a version of broad\nexpressivism. But, as his first two doctrines in the philosophy of\nlanguage already seem to imply, Herder adopted narrow expressivism.\nMoreover, after much wrestling with the subject, he eventually\ndeveloped a very compelling version of narrow expressivism. The key\nwork here is again the Critical Forests. By the time of\nwriting this work, Herder was already committed to the two doctrines\nin question, and, as this would suggest, from the start in the work he\nis committed to narrow expressivism. However, his commitment to it\nthere is initially unsatisfactory and even inconsistent. For one\nthing, it initially takes the implausible form of denying to the\nnon-linguistic arts any capacity to express thoughts\nautonomously of language by denying that they can express\nthoughts at all. This is the force of the naive theory\nrecently described that the work at first set out to develop. Adding\ninconsistency to this unsatisfactoriness, Herder is from the start in\nthe work also committed to saying (far more plausibly) that visual art\noften does express thoughts—for example, he intervenes\nin a quarrel between Lessing and Winckelmann on the question of\nwhether linguistic art (especially poetry) or visual art (especially\nsculpture) is expressively superior in ways that tend to support\nWinckelmann’s case for visual art. This unsatisfactoriness\nand inconsistency mainly result from Herder’s oversight of a\nsingle fact: that it is perfectly possible to reconcile narrow\nexpressivism with the attribution of thoughts to non-linguistic art,\nnamely, by insisting that the thoughts expressed by non-linguistic\nart must be derivative from and bounded by the artist’s capacity\nfor linguistic expression. However, by the time Herder writes the\nlater parts of the Critical Forests, he has found this\nsolution. Thus in the third part, focusing on a particularly\ninstructive example, he notes that the pictorial representations on\nGreek coins are typically allegorical in nature. And by the time he\nwrites the fourth part he is prepared to say something similar about\nmuch painting as well, speaking there, for example, of “the\nsense, the allegory, the story/history that is put into the whole of a\npainting” (G2:313). By 1778 he\nextends this account to sculpture as well. Thus in the essay\nSculpture [Plastik] from 1778 he abandons the merely\nsensualistic conception of sculpture that had predominated in the\nCritical Forests and instead argues that sculpture is\nessentially expressive of, and therefore needs to be interpreted by, a\nsoul. But this no longer forces him to be unfaithful to his\nprinciple that thought is essentially dependent on, and bounded by,\nlanguage, for he now conceives the thoughts that are expressed by\nsculpture as having a linguistic source:  \nThe sculptor stands in the dark of night and gropes toward the forms\nof gods. The stories of the poets are before and in him. (G4:317)\n \nSubsequently, in the Theological Letters (1780–1) and\nthe Letters for the Advancement, Herder extends the same\nsolution to instrumental music as well. \nThe considered position at which Herder eventually arrived also\nimplies that “non-linguistic” art is dependent on\nthought and language in another way: In the fourth part of the\nCritical Forests (which was only published posthumously in\nthe nineteenth century) he develops the point that human perception is\nof its nature infused with concepts and beliefs, and consequently with\nlanguage—which of course implies that the same is true of the\nperception of “non-linguistic” artworks in particular. So\n“non-linguistic” art is really doubly dependent on thought\nand language: not only for the thoughts that it expresses but\nalso for those that it presupposes in perception. \nWith Herder’s achievement of this refined form of narrow\nexpressivism and Hamann’s articulation of his broad\nexpressivism, there were now two plausible but competing theories\navailable. Nineteenth- and twentieth-century German theorists (e.g.,\nHegel, Schleiermacher, Dilthey, and Gadamer) would subsequently be\ndeeply torn between them. And the issue remains an important one\ntoday. While the philosophical considerations involved are difficult,\nI believe, and have argued elsewhere, that Herder’s position is\nthe correct one. \nHerder’s position here also carries important implications for\nhermeneutics. Since, in his considered view, thought/meaning and\nlanguage play important roles not only in literature but also in\n“non-linguistic” art, for him both cases present similar\ninterpretive challenges, requiring similar interpretive solutions. \nAnother of Herder’s most important contributions to aesthetics\nlies in his historicism, or, a bit more broadly, his recognition that\nthere are radical mental differences between historical periods,\ncultures, and even individuals. In connection with literature and art\nthis position takes five main specific forms. \nFirst, as we have already seen, Herder holds that concepts, beliefs,\nvalues, and so on vary deeply between historical periods, cultures,\nand even individuals. This obviously applies to literature in\nparticular. Moreover, since, as we have just seen, for Herder\nseemingly non-linguistic arts such as painting, sculpture, and music\nlikewise presuppose and express concepts, beliefs, and values, it also\napplies to them. \nSecond, Herder holds that genre—i.e., roughly, a certain set of\npurposes and rules—is an essential aspect of any work of\nliterature or art. But he also holds that genres differ in deep ways\nbetween historical periods (as well as between cultures and even\nindividuals), and this not only in the sense that new genres emerge\nand old ones die, but also in the sense that seeming continuities in\ngenre typically in fact mask important differences. For example, in\nthe essay Shakespeare (1773) he argues in detail that the\ngenres of ancient Greek “tragedy” and Shakespearean\n“tragedy”, which interpreters have often assumed to be the\nsame, are in fact deeply different from each other, constituted by\ndifferent purposes and rules. Similarly, in This Too a Philosophy\nof History (1774), he argues, against Winckelmann, who had tended\nto assimilate the genres of ancient Greek portrait sculpture and\nPharaonic Egyptian portrait sculpture, that whereas the former was\ndominated by the genre-purpose of portraying this-worldly life, charm,\nand beauty, the latter had the quite contrary genre-purpose of\nconveying ideas of death and eternity. \nThird, Herder argues that literature began predominantly sensuous in\ncharacter but then became increasingly intellectual as history\nproceeded. In the early essays On the Ode (1764/5) and\nAttempt at a History of Lyric Poetry he explains this\ndevelopment in terms of a diminution of strong feelings (e.g., fear)\nand an increase in mental complexity and science, and he regards it as\na sort of decline. Later on, in the Letters for the\nAdvancement, he retains the descriptive part of this account, but\nrevises its conception that a decline is involved: the more sensuous\npoetry of the ancients and the more intellectualized poetry of the\nmoderns are two different but equally legitimate types of poetry. \nFourth, Herder holds that aesthetic values such as beauty are\nultimately a matter of feelings and that the feelings in question vary\nin important ways between one period, culture, or even individual and\nanother. This theme is already prominent in On the Ode, where\nhe discusses major differences in the feelings of beauty that occur\nbetween different periods/cultures—for example, between his own\nage and the age of the ancient Greeks. It is also prominent in On\nthe Change of Taste (1766), where he adds that the changes\ninvolved are indeed sometimes extreme enough to amount to an outright\ninversion. \nFifth, Herder holds that it is an essential part of the function of\nliterature and art to communicate moral values, but he also observes\nthat the moral values communicated often differ in deep ways from one\nperiod, culture, or individual to another. For example, in Attempt\nat a History of Lyric Poetry he argues (very insightfully) that\nearly Greek poetry, especially Homer, communicates a very different\nset of moral values than ours. \nThese historicist insights concerning literature and art are extremely\nimportant in their own right. In addition, both for Herder and in\nfact, they carry deep implications for the interpretation and\nthe critical evaluation of literature and art. Let us\nreconsider the first two of them in this connection. \nThe first insight concerns radical differences in concepts, beliefs,\nvalues, and so on. Since literature paradigmatically expresses such\nthings and is linguistic, Herder’s general hermeneutic\nprinciples for interpreting linguistic texts and discourse in the face\nof radical mental difference (as already discussed) of course apply to\nliterature in particular. Accordingly, in the Critical\nForests he emphasizes that it is important to penetrate\nHomer’s alien linguistic and conceptual world by using careful\nphilological means; that it is always necessary to interpret the local\nfeatures within a work, for example, “ridiculous”\npassages, such as the Thersites passage, in the Iliad (II:\n211–277), in light of the economy of the whole work; and (this\ntime in connection with the example of interpreting the odes of\nHorace) that the solution to the problem of achieving such holism\ndespite the need to interpret the parts of a text sequentially lies in\nworking through the text in sequence in order to arrive at a\nprovisional interpretation of all its parts together, then applying\nthis provisional interpretation of the whole text in order to refine\nthe interpretation of each part, and so on indefinitely. \nBut since Herder also holds that such seemingly non-linguistic forms\nof art as painting, sculpture, and music likewise presuppose and\nexpress concepts, beliefs, values, and so on that are ultimately\ngrounded in language, he believes that the same general hermeneutic\nprinciples for interpreting linguistic works in the face of radical\nmental difference also make an essential contribution to the\ninterpretation of this sort of art. \nMoreover, since understanding what a piece of literature or art\npresupposes or expresses is obviously a prerequisite for evaluating it\nproperly, this sort of hermeneutic approach is not only essential for\ninterpreting it but also for evaluating it. \nOur second example concerns genre. Herder believes,\nplausibly, that a work of art is always written or made in order to\nexemplify a certain genre, and that it is vitally important for the\ninterpreter to identify its genre in order to understand it. \nWhy does he believe that identifying genre is essential for\nunderstanding? He has at least three reasons (all of them good ones):\nFirst, grasping a work’s genre is itself an essential\nconstituent of understanding the work and its contents (much as\ngrasping a sentence’s illocutionary force is an essential\nconstituent of understanding the sentence and its contents). Second,\nsince an author intends his work to exemplify a certain genre, there\nwill normally be aspects of the work’s meaning that are\nexpressed, not explicitly in any of its parts, but rather through its\nintended exemplification of the genre. Third, correctly identifying\nthe genre is also vitally important for accurately interpreting things\nthat are expressed explicitly in the parts of a work. \nHowever, as we noted, Herder introduces an important historicist\ninsight about genre here: he recognizes that even when different\nhistorical periods, cultures, or individuals appear to share a single\ngenre—for example, ancient Greek “tragedy” and\nShakespearean “tragedy”, or Pharaonic Egyptian\n“portrait sculpture” and ancient Greek “portrait\nsculpture”—this appearance usually in fact masks important\ndifferences. \nThis has important consequences for interpretation. For example, it\nleads Herder to an emphatic rejection of apriorism as an approach to\nidentifying a work’s genre—certainly the absolute\napriorism of refusing in one’s definition of the genre to be\nguided by an observation of examples at all, but also the more\ntempting relative apriorism of indeed allowing oneself to be guided by\nthe observation of examples though restricting these to a limited\nnumber of cases and excluding others to which the resulting\ngenre-conception is then to be applied in interpretation. For in light\nof the historicist insight just mentioned even the latter procedure\nwill usually turn out to be disastrous, in Herder’s view. \nInstead, according to Herder, the interpreter should approach the task\nof identifying the genre that is involved in a work in a thorough and\nscrupulous empirical manner. As one might expect, this above all\nrequires examining the work itself closely in order to discover which\ngenre-purposes and -rules are operative within it. But it also\nrequires taking into account the whole social context within which the\nwork was produced and the historical genesis of its genre through\nantecedent genres. In addition, it may sometimes include taking into\naccount an author’s or artist’s explicit statements about\nthe genre that he is using. \nMoreover, Herder also emphasizes that identifying the genre of a work\ncorrectly by these means is vitally important not only for\ninterpreting the work correctly, but also for critically\nevaluating it correctly: French critics not only make an\ninterpretive mistake when they go to Shakespeare with a genre\nin mind from the ancient world that was not in fact his, but they\nalso, on this basis, make an evaluative mistake: because they\nfalsely assume that he somehow must be aspiring to realize the\ngenre-purpose and -rules that Aristotle found in ancient tragedy, they\nfault him for failing to realize these, while at the same time they\noverlook the quite different genre-purpose and -rules that he really\ndoes aspire to realize and his success in realizing these.\nSimilarly, Winckelmann not only makes an interpretive mistake\nwhen he implicitly imputes to the Egyptians a Greek genre-conception\nfor sculpture that was not theirs, but also, on this basis, makes an\nevaluative one: because he falsely assumes that the Egyptians\nsomehow must be aspiring to realize the Greek genre-purpose and\n-rules, he faults them for failing to realize these, and at the same\ntime he overlooks their success in realizing the very different\ngenre-purpose and -rules that they really do aspire to realize. \nHerder’s new historicist approach to interpreting and evaluating\nliterature and art led to enormous progress in the actual\ninterpretation and critical evaluation of both. For example, it\nenabled the Schlegel brothers to achieve a much deeper understanding\nof tragedy than had been achieved before, and it enabled Friedrich\nSchlegel to develop a new, highly sophisticated form of art history\n(especially in his work on paintings in the Louvre and on cathedral\narchitecture), thereby preparing the way for nineteenth- and\ntwentieth-century scholarship on tragedy and art history. \nHerder also has important ideas concerning a topic that is often\nthought to be central to aesthetics: beauty. A first\nimportant idea he develops here (both in relation to art and more\ngenerally) is that standards of beauty vary greatly from one\nhistorical period or culture to another. At least, this is his normal\nposition, from early works such as On the Ode and On the\nChange of Taste to late ones such as the Calligone\n(where he invokes it against Kant’s Critique of the Power of\nJudgment). Occasionally—for example, in the Critical\nForests and even at points in the Calligone—he\ninstead argues (as other thinkers, such as Hume, had done before him)\nthat there is a deeper unity in standards of beauty across historical\nperiods and cultures. However, the former position is his more\nconsidered one and is the more plausible one. \nA second important idea, which he already develops in the Critical\nForests (and then repeats later in the Calligone),\nconcerns the very concept of beauty. He argues, plausibly, that the\nconcept’s origins lay in visual experience (as, he\nthinks, is suggested by the etymological connection in German between\nthe words schön [beautiful] and Schein [shine,\nappearance]), but that it has since been extended from that primary\ndomain to cover virtually “everything that has a pleasurable\neffect on the soul”, that in this sense “sight …\nallegorizes the images, the representations, the conceits of the\nsoul”, so that beauty becomes our most general term of\napproval for whatever we find pleasing in relation to any of the\nsenses and indeed mental life more broadly (G2:289–291). \nA third important idea that he develops is that beauty is in fact\nconsiderably less important in literature and art than it has often\nbeen thought to be. This demotion of beauty is not only encouraged by\nhis somewhat deflationary genealogy of the concept just mentioned but\nalso by his proto-Romantic conception that literature and art have\nfundamental functions in relation to language (and thought), religion,\nand morality, and by his mature insistence that meaning and thought\nplay an important role even in “non-linguistic” art. He\ntended to advocate this demotion of beauty increasingly as time went\non. Accordingly, whereas in early works such as On the Ode\nand the Critical Forests he still treated beauty as central\nto aesthetics, by the time he wrote the Calligone he had\nchanged his mind and now insisted that it is not nearly as essential\nto art as it is often taken to be. In particular, he argues in the\nCalligone that art is much more essentially a matter of\nBildung—cultural formation or education (especially in\nmoral respects). \nFinally, let us consider Herder’s thesis that literature and art\nhave a morally educative function. In On the Effect of Poetic Art\non the Ethics of Peoples in Ancient and Modern Times (1778),\nOn the Influence of the Belles Lettres on the Higher Sciences\n(1781), and the Calligone he not only sees this as one of\ntheir most essential functions, but also holds that literature has a\nmore powerful effect as an instrument of moral education than other\ninstruments, such as law. \nHe also develops a nuanced account of how literature and art do and\nshould perform this function. For example, in On the\nInfluence he specifies three distinct ways in which literature or\npoetry promotes the formation of moral character. First, it does so\n“through light rules”—in other words, through a\nsubtle articulation of ethical principles. Second, and more\nimportantly in his view, it does so by presenting good moral role\nmodels in a positive light so that people will emulate them:\n“still better, through good examples”. Third, it also does\nso by conveying a range of practical experience that is conducive to\nthe formation of moral character and which would otherwise have to be\nacquired, if at all, by the more arduous and painful route of\nfirst-hand experience. In addition, Herder elsewhere implies a fourth\nimportant way in which literature contributes to moral formation: it\nis a fundamental principle underlying his Popular Songs that\nby vividly conveying the inner lives—for instance, the fears,\nhopes, and joys—of other people to its audience or readership,\nliterature will stir their sympathies for them and hence inculcate\nmore moral attitudes toward them. Fifth, Herder in the\nCalligone adds a further point, concerning\n“non-linguistic” art, namely, that visual art has a power\nto make moral ideals attractive by presenting them blended with\nphysical beauty, and that, similarly, music has a power to affect\nmoral character either for good or for ill depending on the principles\nof conduct that are associated with it. \nHerder’s conception that the formation of moral character both\nis and ought to be the primary function of literature and art serves\nhim as an important criterion for evaluating individual works. Thus\nwhen he observes in On the Effect that in contrast to earlier\npoetry modern poetry has typically lost this function, he means this\nas a serious criticism of modern poetry. And he even applied this\ncriterion as a ground for criticizing certain works by his friends\nGoethe and Schiller that he considered to be immoral or amoral in\ncontent. \nHerder also develops a philosophically powerful and historically\ninfluential moral philosophy. This consists of a set of positions in\nboth meta-ethics and first-order morality. Let us consider the former\nfirst. \nAs in the philosophy of mind, Herder’s position in meta-ethics\nis naturalistic in spirit. Such a position was by no means\nuncontroversial in Herder’s day, as can be seen, for example,\nfrom his correspondence with Mendelssohn in 1769 concerning\nSpalding’s and Mendelssohn’s religious, afterlife-focused\nconception of humankind’s “vocation\n[Bestimmung]”, which Herder sharply opposed in favor of\na this-worldly conception of the same. \nAs was mentioned earlier, Herder in particular holds a sentimentalist\nposition concerning the nature of morality: rather than being a sort\nof knowledge of objective facts (as in Plato’s moral theory, for\nexample) or a set of deliverances of universal reason (as in the\ncritical Kant’s moral theory, for instance), morality is\nfundamentally an expression of human sentiments. Herder already\nespoused such a position in How Philosophy Can Become (1765),\ncontinues it in This Too a Philosophy of History (1774)\n(where he usually refers to the sentiments in question as\nNeigungen, inclinations), and still holds it in Letters\nfor the Advancement (1793–7) (where he usually refers to\nthem as Gesinnungen, attitudes). \nHerder took over this position from his teacher, the pre-critical\nKant, who had similarly espoused a form of sentimentalism in\nDreams of a Spirit Seer (1766). Via Kant it can ultimately be\ntraced back to the British sentimentalist tradition, especially Hume,\nwhose main argument for it Herder seems to echo at points in This\nToo a Philosophy of History: moral judgment of its very nature\nmotivates; but reason does not motivate, only sentiments do that;\ntherefore moral judgment must fundamentally consist of sentiments. \nHowever, Herder’s sentimentalism is not crude (as Hume’s\narguably was), for he recognizes that cognition—i.e., concepts\nand beliefs—plays a major role in morality as well. This can\nalready be seen from the Critical Forests (1769), where he\nargues against cruder theories of moral value that equate them with\nsentiments abstracted from all cognition, and where in the fourth part\nhe indeed argues that sensations in general are concept-, \nbelief-, and\ntheory-laden. It can also be seen from On the Cognition and\nSensation (1778). (Nietzsche would later take over this\nsophisticated form of sentimentalism from Herder.) \nWhere Herder’s position becomes most original, though, is in\nhistoricizing the moral sentiments in question—or (a\nlittle more broadly and more precisely) in seeing them as varying\ndeeply from one historical period to another, one culture to another,\nand even one individual to another. He already champions such a\nposition in On the Change of Taste (1766), for example,\nindeed going as far as to say that the moral sentiments in question\nsometimes even get inverted, so that what one period, culture, or\nindividual found morally praiseworthy another finds morally\nreprehensible. This radical position can also be found in his\npublished writings. This position makes Herder’s sentimentalism\nmarkedly different from Hume’s, rather a precursor of\nNietzsche’s (which it again strongly influenced here). \nAnother radical thesis that Herder champions is that moral sentiments\nas a rule turn out to be both suitable to and explicable in terms of\nthe particular type of society and mode of life to which they belong.\nThis is a central thesis in This Too a Philosophy of History.\nThus Herder tries to show there that the moral values of each of the\nmajor period/cultures that he considers in the work can be explained\nin terms of their suitability to the character of the society and the\nway of life to which they belonged—for example, the ancient\nEgyptians’ morality of diligence and civic faithfulness to their\nagricultural, industrial, and urban society and mode of life; the\nRomans’ morality of courage, prudence, and patriotism to their\nimperialistic, war-based society and mode of life; and so on.  This\nthesis reinforces Herder’s Humean argument for sentimentalism by\nshowing that moral attitudes are explicable in terms of their social\nfunction without recourse to moral facts. (Here again Herder’s\napproach would later be echoed by Nietzsche.)\n \nAnother major contribution that Herder makes in the area of\nmeta-ethics is his application of his “genetic” method of\nexplanation to the domain of morality. This method depends on\nHerder’s historicism. It purports to make a mentalistic\nphenomenon more intelligible by tracing it back to its historical\norigins and showing how these developed into it via a series of\nintermediate forms. Herder first developed this method in the\nmid-1760s in application to literary genres and language (in\nAttempt at a History of Lyric Poetry and the\nFragments respectively), but he then went on to apply it to\nmoral (and other) values in This Too a Philosophy of History\n(1774). Since moralities change over time, one can contribute to\nexplaining or better understanding the morality of a late age, for\nexample, eighteenth-century Europe, by identifying the earliest\nmorality in its historical tradition and then showing how this\ndeveloped through a chain of subsequent moralities into the late\nmorality in question. Accordingly, This Too a Philosophy of\nHistory attempts to show (roughly) that after the authoritarian\nmorality of the ancient Hebrews had laid the foundations, the\nEgyptians’ morality of diligence and citizen’s\nfaithfulness arose; this then gave way to the Phoenicians’\nmorality of freedom and openness; the Greeks next synthesized the\npreceding moralities into a morality of citizen’s faithfulness\nand freedom; Rome then modified this inheritance into moral values of\ncourage, prudence, and patriotism; following the collapse of the Roman\nEmpire, the northern tribes, together with Christianity, developed a\nricher set of values that included courage, faith, honesty, reverence\nfor gods, humanity, chastity, and knightly honor; and then finally the\n(professed) morality of modern Europe emerged as a result of this\nwhole tradition. This Herderian approach to explaining, or\ncontributing to a better understanding of, morality would subsequently\nbe taken over and developed further by Hegel, Nietzsche (especially in\nOn the Genealogy of Morality [1887]), and Foucault. \nA further important aspect of Herder’s meta-ethics has already\nbeen touched on: the complex position that he already develops in\nHow Philosophy Can Become that sentimentalism is the correct\naccount of the nature of morality; that cognitivism is therefore\nuseless as an account of morality or as an approach for inculcating\nit, and is moreover harmful because it provokes skepticism about\nmorality and distracts people from the real foundations of morality\nand from reinforcing them; and that philosophy should therefore\ninstead focus on identifying and reinforcing those real foundations,\nnamely, a set of causal mechanisms that generate and support the moral\nsentiments. \nAs was also mentioned earlier, How Philosophy Can Become\nmainly emphasizes certain forms of education and an emotive type of\npreaching in this connection—both activities that Herder went on\nto theorize about at greater length elsewhere. But these are only two\nparts of a much broader theory and practice of moral pedagogy, or\ncultivation of the moral sentiments, that he developed over the course\nof his career, in what became one of his most central, distinctive,\nand consuming projects. The additional causal mechanisms that he\nidentified and supported included the influence of morally exemplary\nindividuals, the law, and literature (as well as the other arts). \nHerder’s development of this whole theory and practice of moral\npedagogy was lifelong and tireless. It constitutes perhaps the single\nmost important philosophical contribution to moral pedagogy since the\n(strikingly similar) moral pedagogy that Protagoras developed in\nantiquity (as preserved in the Great Discourse of Plato’s\nProtagoras). \nAs can be seen from This Too a Philosophy of History, Herder\nbelieved that this project had a special historical urgency in his day\nbecause since the Renaissance and the Reformation the moral values\nthat people profess, such as love of humanity, freedom, and honor,\nhave largely become hollow, no longer genuinely anchored in moral\nsentiments, and therefore fail to serve the social function to which\nthey would correspond. \nA final very important aspect of Herder’s meta-ethics, prominent\nespecially in This Too a Philosophy of History, flows from\nseveral of the meta-ethical positions that have already been\nmentioned, specifically, from sentimentalism, the thesis of the\nprofound variability of moral sentiments between periods, cultures,\nand even individuals, and the thesis of the general suitedness of the\nvarious moralities that arise to the societies and modes of life to\nwhich they belong: there can be no justification for making\ndifferential evaluative comparisons between one morality and another,\nfor saying that one morality is better or worse than another. This is\nthe implication of a famous remark in This Too a Philosophy of\nHistory that where values are concerned  \nat bottom all comparison proves to be problematic … Each nation\nhas its center of happiness in itself, like every sphere its center of\ngravity! (HPW 296–297) \nThis relativism (as it has often, and quite reasonably, been called)\nis arguably one of Herder’s main contributions to moral\nphilosophy. However, it is also problematic, both in its relation to\nother parts of Herder’s philosophy and intrinsically. (For\nfurther details, see Section 2 of the\n Supplementary Discussion.) \nLet us now turn more briefly to some of Herder’s distinctive\npositions in first-order morality. For at this level too he developed\npositions that are of great importance—for their intrinsic\nvalue, their influence on successors, or both. \nOne very fundamental, original, and attractive principle that he\ndevelops here is what might be called pluralist\ncosmopolitanism, in contradistinction to homogenizing\ncosmopolitanism. Cosmopolitanism already had a long history by\nHerder’s day that reached back to (Cynicism and) Stoicism in the\npagan Greek world. That tradition had usually championed a\nhomogenizing form of cosmopolitanism, i.e., a form of it that grants\nequal ethical respect to all human beings only on the basis of an\nassumption that they all share much in common psychologically,\nespecially in their moral values. In particular, Herder’s\nEnlightenment predecessors, including Kant, had held such a position.\nMoreover, this version of cosmopolitanism continues to be predominant\namong moral philosophers and worthy organizations such as the United\nNations to this day. There is a huge problem with this form of\ncosmopolitanism, however: its assumption that human beings all share a\ngreat deal in common psychologically, especially in moral values, is\nfalse (and attempting to make it true would require\nmassive coercion). Herder recognized this problem, but he did not\nthrow out the baby of cosmopolitanism with the bathwater of\nhomogenization. Instead, he developed a distinctive pluralist\nform of cosmopolitanism: a commitment to equal moral respect for all\nhuman beings despite, and indeed even in part because of, the\ndiversity of their psychologies, and in particular their moral values.\nThis position is prominent in the Letters for the\nAdvancement, for example. This pluralist cosmopolitanism also\nundergirds Herder’s strong stance against imperialism and\ncolonialism in This Too a Philosophy of History, the\nIdeas, and the Letters for the Advancement. \nA second moral principle of Herder’s that deserves to be\nmentioned here is the closely related principle of humanity\n[Humanität], which he develops in the Ideas and\nthe Letters for the Advancement. This principle has both\ndescriptive aspects—in particular, an implication of the unity\nof the human species and of the mere superficiality of racial\ndifferences—and normative ones. Among the latter, it includes an\nimplication of cosmopolitanism. It also includes implications of\nspecific standards of decent treatment (e.g., not killing, physically\nabusing, or deceiving people). And it also functions as a sort of\nsubstitute for the concept of human rights, a concept that\nconstitutes a closer specification of cosmopolitanism but which Herder\ntends to shy away from for various reasons (see for this the section\non Political Philosophy). \nA further noteworthy component of Herder’s first-order morality\nis his moral ideal of Bildung, in the sense of autonomous,\nindividualistic development of all one’s capacities into a\nharmonious whole. He already worked out this ideal in writings from\n1769. Later, in On the Cognition and Sensation, he developed\nsome deeper philosophical foundations for it: an account of human\nautonomy or freedom as something compatible with the laws of nature\n(an account closely related to one he had already given in\nthe Treatise on the Origin according to which a distinctive\ncharacteristic of humankind is a certain sort of flexibility, or\nfreedom from determination by narrow instincts); a quasi-Leibnizian\naccount of individuality as a general feature of all nature,\nincluding human nature as a special case; and an account of the deep\ninterdependence of the psychological faculties, which undergirds the\n“harmonious whole” component of the ideal. This ideal\nwould later go on to have an enormous influence on successors such as\nSchiller, Wilhelm von Humboldt (who saw its realization as the highest\npurpose of the state and indeed even of the whole universe), and\nHegel. \nBesides these several striking moral ideals, Herder is also committed\nto a range of much less surprising ones, especially ones associated\nwith the Christian moral tradition, such as sympathy, love,\nforgiveness, honesty, justice, and equality. Although not surprising\nin themselves, these ideals help to illustrate another striking\nfeature of Herder’s moral philosophy: his firm avoidance of the\nsort of moral monism that began in antiquity with Plato’s\nProtagoras (specifically, with its argument for the unity of\nthe virtues) and which has continued in modernity with Kant (in his\ncommitment to the categorical imperative as the sole moral principle)\nand Utilitarianism (with its commitment to happiness as the sole moral\ncriterion), in favor of moral pluralism: a commitment to an\nirreducible plurality of moral values or ideals. This is arguably\nanother great merit of his moral philosophy. \nFinally, Herder’s ethical theory is important not only for what\nit includes but also for what it omits. In particular, he shows little\ninterest in the issue of free will, hardly ever if at all implying\nthat such a thing exists or that it is a precondition of moral\nresponsibility. (Freedom in the sense of a sort of autonomy,\nor flexibility, that exists within the limits of laws of\nnature and merely amounts to a certain liberty from constraint by\nnarrow instincts and political freedom are another matter; he\nis interested in these.) This position contrasts sharply with\nthat of most modern moral philosophers, including Hume and Kant, for\nexample. However, it looks much less idiosyncratic if one takes a\nbroader perspective and notices, for instance, that neither the\nearlier Greeks (e.g., Homer) nor the Chinese ethical tradition have\nhad any conception of free will or any inclination to think that such\na thing is required for moral responsibility. Moreover, I would argue\nthat Herder’s position here, like that of these other\ntraditions, turns out to be a great virtue, since the very conception\nof free will and of morality’s dependence on it, which has\ndominated western philosophy and religion since late antiquity, turns\nout to be thoroughly misbegotten. \nHerder’s philosophy of history mainly appears in two works:\nfirst in This Too a Philosophy of History and then later in\nthe Ideas. \nHis philosophy of history is striking for its development of a\nteleological conception of history as the progressive realization of\n“reason” and “humanity”—a conception\nthat anticipated and strongly influenced Hegel, among others. However,\nthis conception is very dubious on reflection, and is arguably\nnot one of Herder’s most intrinsically important\nachievements in this area. \nHis most intrinsically important achievement arguably rather lies in\nhis development of the thesis already mentioned\nearlier—contradicting such Enlightenment philosopher-historians\nas Hume and Voltaire—that there exist radical mental differences\nbetween different historical periods (and cultures), that\npeople’s concepts, beliefs, values, sensations, and so on differ\nin deep ways from one period (or culture) to another. This thesis is\nalready prominent in On the Change of Taste (1766) and it\nlasts throughout Herder’s career. It had an enormous influence\non successors such as the Schlegel brothers, Schleiermacher, Hegel,\nNietzsche, and Dilthey. \nHerder makes the empirical exploration of the realm of mental\ndiversity that this thesis posits the very core of the discipline of\nhistory. For, as has often been noted, he takes relatively little\ninterest in the so-called “great” political and military\ndeeds and events of history, focusing instead on the\n“innerness” of history’s participants. This choice\nis quite deliberate and self-conscious. Because of it, psychology\nand interpretation inevitably take center-stage as methods in the\ndiscipline of historiography for Herder. \nHerder has deep philosophical reasons for this choice, and hence for\nassigning psychology and interpretation a central role in\nhistoriography. To begin with, he has negative reasons\ndirected against traditional political-military historiography. Why\nshould historiography focus on the “great”\npolitical and military deeds and events of the past, after all? There\nare several possible answers: (1) A first would be that they are\nfascinating or morally edifying. But Herder will not accept this. For\none thing, he denies that mere fascination or curiosity is a\nsufficiently serious motive for doing historiography. For another\nthing, his antiauthoritarianism, antimilitarism, and borderless\nhumanitarianism cause him to find the acts of political domination,\nwar, and empire that make up the vast bulk of these\n“great” deeds and events not morally edifying but morally\nrepugnant. \nThis leaves two other types of motivation that might be appealed to\nfor doing the sort of historiography in question: (2) because\nexamining the course of such deeds and events reveals some sort of\noverall meaning in history, or (3) because it leads to\nefficient causal insights that enable us to explain the past and\nperhaps also predict or control the future. Herder is again\nskeptical about these rationales, however. This skepticism is perhaps\nclearest in the Older Critical Forestlet (1767–8)\nwhere, in criticism of rationale (2), he consigns the task of\n“the whole ordering together of many occurrences into a\nplan” not to the historian but instead to the “creator,\n… painter, and artist”, and in criticism of rationale\n(3), he goes as far as to assert (on the basis of a Hume- and\nKant-influenced general skepticism about causal knowledge) that with\nthe search for efficient causes in history “historical seeing\nstops and prophecy begins”. His later writings depart from this\nearly position in some obvious ways, but they also in important\nways remain faithful to it. (For further details, see Section 3 of the\n Supplementary Discussion.) \nHerder’s arguments against these three rationales are all\nbriefly summarized in Letters 121–122 from the 10th\nCollection of the Letters for the Advancement (though they\nare more fully stated individually elsewhere). \nComplementing this negative case against the claims of traditional\npolitical-military history to be of overriding importance, Herder also\nhas positive reasons for focusing instead on the\n“innerness” of human life in history. (1) One reason is\ncertainly just the sheer interest of this subject-matter (though, as\nwas mentioned before, that would not be a sufficient reason in his\neyes). (2) Another reason is that his discovery of radical diversity\nin human mentality has shown there to be a much broader, less\nexplored, and more intellectually challenging field for investigation\nhere than previous generations of historians have realized. Two\nfurther reasons are moral in nature: (3) He believes, quite plausibly,\nthat studying people’s minds through their literature, visual\nart, and so on generally exposes one to them at their moral best (in\nsharp contrast to studying their political-military history), so that\nthere are benefits of moral edification to be gleaned here. (4) He has\ncosmopolitan and egalitarian moral motives for studying people’s\nminds through their literature, visual art, and so forth: in sharp\ncontrast to studying unedifying and elite-focused political-military\nhistory, this promises to enhance our sympathies for peoples, and\nmoreover for peoples at all social levels, including lower ones.\nFinally, doing “inner” history is also important as an\ninstrument for our non-moral self-improvement: (5) It serves\nto enhance our self-understanding. One important reason for this is\nthat it is by, and only by, contrasting one’s own outlook with\nthe outlooks of other peoples that one comes to recognize what is\nuniversal and invariant in it and what by contrast distinctive and\nvariable. Another is that in order fully to understand one’s own\noutlook one needs to identify its historical origins and how they\ndeveloped into it (this is Herder’s justly famous\n“genetic” method, about which more will be said in a\nmoment). (6) Herder believes that an accurate investigation of the\n(non-moral) ideals of past ages can serve to enrich our own ideals and\nhappiness. This motive finds broad application in his work. One\nexample is his exploration of past literatures in the\nFragments largely with a view to drawing from them lessons\nabout how better to develop modern German literature. \nHerder’s decision to focus on the “innerness” of\nhistory’s participants, and his consequent emphasis on\npsychology and interpretation as historical methods, strikingly\nanticipated and strongly influenced Dilthey. So too did his rationale\nfor this decision, as described above, which is indeed arguably\nsuperior to Dilthey’s, especially on its positive side. \nAnother of Herder’s major contributions to the philosophy of\nhistory, likewise based on his insight into radical mental difference,\nis the “genetic” method recently mentioned. This was a\nrevolutionary invention that proved to be of enormous intrinsic value\nand which exercised a huge influence on the philosophies of important\nsuccessors such as Hegel, Nietzsche, and Foucault. \nHerder’s genetic method is first and foremost a means toward\nbetter understanding, or explaining, psychological outlooks\nand psychologically laden practices—especially a means toward\nbetter understanding one’s own, toward better\nself-understanding. The method achieves its distinctive\ncontribution to better understanding such outlooks and practices,\nsaliently including one’s own, by showing, in a naturalistic\n(i.e., non-religious, non-mythical, non-transcendent) way, that and\nhow they have developed historically out of earlier origins prior to\nwhich they were not yet really present at all and from which they have\nemerged via a series of transformations. \nHerder initially developed this method in the 1760s mainly in relation\nto poetry and language. His unpublished Attempt at a History of\nLyrical Poetry (1764) contains his earliest presentation of the\nmethod and applies it to poetry. His slightly later published work,\nthe Fragments (1767–8), refines his presentation of it\nand applies it to language. He then goes on to apply the method to\nmoral (and other) values. Thus in This Too a\nPhilosophy of History (1774) he largely focuses on moral,\naesthetic, and prudential values, developing the large-scale\n“genetic” thesis that history has consisted of a great\nchain of cultures (Oriental patriarchal culture, then Egyptian, then\nPhoenician, then Greek, then Roman, and so on) that have built on each\nother cumulatively and thus eventually generated modern European\nculture (toward which he is strikingly ambivalent). For example, he\nclaims that Greek culture combined antecedent Oriental and Egyptian\nculture’s obedience with antecedent Phoenician culture’s\nfreedom in a new synthesis, and then passed this on to subsequent\nEuropean cultures. \nHegel, especially in his Phenomenology of Spirit (1807),\nNietzsche, especially in On the Genealogy of Morality (1887),\nand Foucault subsequently took over this method and modified it in\nvarious ways. \nHow exactly is Herder’s method supposed to advance\n(self-)understanding? It aspires to do so in\ntwo distinguishable ways, which together constitute what one might\ncall the essential model of genetic explanation. \nThe method’s first contribution to (self-)understanding\nis roughly as follows. Someone who possesses his or her own\ndistinctive concepts, beliefs, values, sensations, customs, art forms,\nand so on but does not compare them with perspectives that have lacked\nthem altogether or possessed variant alternatives runs a grave risk of\ntaking them to be universal and indispensable, and also of overlooking\nwhat is distinctive in their character. The genetic method counteracts\nboth of these types of (self-)misunderstanding by making one familiar\nwith earlier historical periods that have lacked the relevant concepts\netc. altogether and with intervening historical periods in which they\nwere indeed anticipated but only in forms significantly different from\nthe form in which one possesses them oneself, thereby making it\npossible both to perceive the non-universality and dispensability of\nthe concepts etc. in question and to compare them with others in order\nto reveal their distinctive character. \nThe method’s second main contribution to (self-)understanding\nconsists at its most basic level in showing two things: first, that\nthe concepts etc. in question, rather than, say, either having been\ninnate and therefore present in human minds all along or else having\nemerged ex nihilo fully formed at some point in history, are\nthe products of historical developments before which they did not\nreally exist at all and in the course of which they only existed in\nvariant forms; second, what exactly these historical developments that\nproduced them have been. At a less basic level, it normally also\nincludes a provision of one or another further sort of explanation\nthat is more specific in character. For example, the method shows that\nlyric poetry began as, and then continued throughout its\ntransformations to be, an expression of deep emotions; that languages\ndeveloped gradually from primitive beginnings to achieve their\nstriking later complexity; or that modern culture and its values arose\nthrough a series of accumulations and transformations of earlier\ncultures and their values. \nFinally, Herder is also impressive for having recognized, and, though\nnot solved, at least grappled with, a problem that flows from his\npicture of history (and intercultural comparison) as an arena of deep\nvariations in human mentality. This is the problem of\nskepticism. (For further details, see Section 4 of the\n Supplementary Discussion.) \nHerder is not usually thought of as a political philosopher. But he\nwas one, and moreover one whose political ideals are more admirable,\ntheoretical stances more defensible, and thematic focuses of more\nenduring relevance than those of any other German philosopher of the\nperiod. His most developed treatment of political philosophy occurs\nrelatively late, in a work prompted by the French Revolution of 1789:\nthe Letters for the Advancement of Humanity (1793–7)\n(including the early draft from 1792, which is important for its frank\nstatement of his views about domestic politics). \nWhat are the main features of Herder’s political philosophy? Let\nus begin with his political ideals, first in domestic and\nthen in international politics. In domestic politics, the mature\nHerder is a liberal, a republican, a democrat, and an egalitarian\n(this, it should be noted, in historical circumstances where such\npositions were by no means commonplace, and were embraced at a\npersonal cost). \nHis liberalism is especially radical in that it advocates\nvirtually unrestricted freedom of thought and expression (including\nfreedom of worship). He has several reasons for this position: (1) He\nfeels that such freedom belongs to people’s moral dignity. (2)\nHe believes that it is essential for individuals’\nself-realization. (3) He believes that people’s capacities for\ndiscerning the truth are very limited and that it is only through an\nongoing contest between opposing viewpoints that the cause of truth\ngets advanced. (John Stuart Mill would later borrow from these\nconsiderations—largely via Wilhelm von Humboldt—to form\nthe core of his own case for freedom of thought and expression in\nOn Liberty.) \nHerder is also committed to republicanism and democracy\n(advocating a much broader franchise than Kant, for example). He has\nseveral reasons for this position, ultimately deriving from an\negalitarian concern for the interests of all members of society: (1)\nHe feels it to be intrinsically right that the mass of people should\nshare in their government, rather than having it imposed upon them.\n(2) He believes that this will better serve their other\ninterests as well, since government by also tends to be\ngovernment for. (3) He in particular believes that it will\ndiminish the warfare that is pervasive under the prevailing autocratic\npolitical régimes of Europe, where it benefits the few rulers\nwho decide on it but costs the mass of people dearly. \nFinally, Herder’s egalitarianism also extends beyond\nthis. He does not reject class differences, property, or inequalities\nof property outright. But he does oppose all hierarchical oppression;\nargue that all people in society have capacities for self-realization,\nand must receive the opportunity to fulfill them; and insist that\ngovernment must intervene to ensure that they do receive it, for\nexample, by guaranteeing education and a minimum standard of living\nfor the poor. \nConcerning international politics, Herder has often been classified as\na “nationalist” or (perhaps even worse) a “German\nnationalist” (for example, by R.R. Ergang in Herder and the\nFoundations of German Nationalism [1931] and K.R. Popper in\nThe Open Society and its Enemies [1945]). Some other\nphilosophers from the period deserve such a characterization (for\ninstance, Fichte). But where Herder is concerned it is deeply\nmisleading and unjust.  On the contrary, like Kant’s, his\nfundamental position in international politics is a\ncommitted cosmopolitanism, an impartial concern\nfor all human beings.  This is a large part of the force of\nhis ideal of “humanity”. Hence, for example, in\nthe Letters for the Advancement he approvingly quotes\nFénelon’s remark, “I love my family more than\nmyself; more than my family my fatherland; more than my fatherland\nhumankind” (HPW 389).  Moreover, Herder’s\ncosmopolitanism is arguably purer than Kant's. Kant's is undermined by\nvarious prejudices that he harbors – in particular, racism,\nantisemitism, and misogyny (Kleingeld 2013). By contrast,\nHerder’s is free of such prejudices, which he indeed worked\ntirelessly to combat. \nHerder does also insist on respecting, preserving, and\nadvancing national groupings. However, this is entirely unalarming,\nfor the following reasons: (1) For Herder, this is emphatically\nsomething that must be done for all national groupings\nequally—not just or especially Germany! (In the\nLetters for the Advancement he emphatically rejects any such\nnotion of a “favorite people [Favoritvolk]”, as\nhe puts it [HPW 394].) (2) The “nation” in question\nis not racial but linguistic and cultural (in the Ideas and\nelsewhere Herder indeed criticizes and rejects the very concept of\nrace). (3) Herder does not seek to seal off nations from each\nother’s influence or to keep them static; he regards\ninter-linguistic and -cultural exchange and linguistic-cultural\ndevelopment as normal and welcomes them. (4) Nor does his commitment\nto national groupings involve a centralized, militarized state (in\nthe Ideas and elsewhere he strongly advocates the\ndisappearance of such a state and its replacement by loosely federated\nlocal governments with minimal instruments of force). (5) In addition,\nhis insistence on respecting national groupings is accompanied by the\nstrongest denunciations of military conflict, colonial exploitation,\nand all other forms of harm between nations; a demand that nations\ninstead peacefully cooperate and compete in trade and intellectual\nendeavors for their mutual benefit; and a plea that they should indeed\nactively work to help each other. \nMoreover, Herder has compelling reasons for this insistence on\nrespecting national groupings: (1) The deep diversity of values\nbetween nations entails that homogenization is only a fantasy:\nnon-existent and impracticable. (2) Such diversity also entails that,\nto the extent that it is practicable, it cannot occur\nvoluntarily but only through external coercion. (3) In practice,\nattempts to achieve it, for example, by European colonialism, are\nmoreover coercive from, and subserve, ulterior motives of domination\nand exploitation. (4) Furthermore, real national variety is positively\nvaluable, both as affording individuals a vital sense of local\nbelonging and in itself. \nIndeed, Herder’s pluralist cosmopolitanism is an important and\nattractive alternative to the homogenizing forms of cosmopolitanism,\nbased on delusions concerning either the fact or the prospect of\nuniversally shared values, that have predominated since the\nEnlightenment and are still popular today, both among philosophers\n(especially in the Anglophone world) and in international political\norganizations such as the United Nations. \nAnother important part of Herder’s political philosophy, which\nbears on both domestic and international politics, is his striking\npreference for an ideal of humanity over his age’s\nideal of human rights. (For further details, see Section 5 of\nthe\n Supplementary Discussion.) \nNow that we have surveyed the various political ideals that make up\nHerder’s political position, one final issue still needs to be\naddressed. It might still be objected that all of this does not yet\nreally amount to a political theory—such as other\nphilosophers have provided, including some of Herder’s\ncontemporaries in Germany. In a sense that is true, but\nphilosophically defensible; in another sense it is false. \nIt is true in the following sense. There is indeed no grand\nmetaphysical theory underpinning Herder’s position—no\nPlatonic theory of forms, no correlation of political institutions\nwith “moments” in a Hegelian Logic, no\n“deduction” of political institutions from the nature of\nthe self or the will à la Fichte or Hegel, or whatnot. But that\nis quite deliberate, given Herder’s skepticism about such\nmetaphysics. And is this not indeed philosophically a good thing? \nNor does Herder have any account purporting to justify the moral\nintuitions at work in his political position as a sort of theoretical\ninsight (in the manner of Kant’s theory of the\n“categorical imperative” or Rawls’s theory of the\n“original position”, for example). But that is again quite\ndeliberate, given his sentimentalism in ethics, and his rejection of\nsuch theories as both false and harmful. And is he not again right\nabout this, and the absence of such an account therefore again a good\nthing? \nNor is Herder sympathetic with such tired staples of political theory\nas natural rights, the state of nature, the social contract, the\ngeneral will, and utopias for the future. But again, he has good\nspecific reasons for skepticism about these notions. So this again\nseems like a good thing. \nThis, then, is the sense in which the objection is correct; Herder\ndoes indeed lack a “political theory” of these\nsorts. But he lacks it on principle, and is arguably quite\nright to do so. \nOn the other hand, in another sense it is false to say that he lacks a\n“political theory”. For he does have a\n“political theory” of a different, and arguably far more\nvaluable, sort. First, consistently with his general empiricism, his\nposition in political philosophy is deeply empirically informed. For\ninstance, as can be seen from the Dissertation on the Reciprocal\nInfluence of Government and the Sciences (1780), his thesis\nconcerning the importance of freedom of thought and expression, and\nthe competition between views that it makes possible, for producing\nintellectual progress is largely based on the historical example of\nancient Greece, and in particular Athens, as contrasted with later\nsocieties, such as Rome, that lacked the freedom and competition in\nquestion. And in the 1792 draft of the Letters for the\nAdvancement he even describes the French Revolution and its\nattempts to establish a modern democracy as a sort of\n“experiment” from which we can learn (for example, learn\nwhether democracy can be successfully extended to nations that are\nmuch larger than ancient Athens). \nSecond, in conformity with his general sentimentalism in ethics, he is\nacutely aware that his political position ultimately rests on moral\nsentiments—his own and, for its success, other people’s as\nwell. For example, in the 10th Collection of the\nLetters for the Advancement he emphasizes that people’s\nmoral “dispositions” or “feelings” play a\nfundamental role as essential supports for his political\nposition’s realization. This standpoint absolves him of the need\nto do certain sorts of theorizing—not only precluding any need\nfor cognitivist groundings of the moral intuitions in question, but\nalso promising short, effective solutions to various problems that\nmight look like real brain-teasers to a cognitivist. However, it also\nleads him to engage in theorizing of another sort, namely, theorizing\nabout the ways in which, and the causal means by which, people’s\nmoral sentiments should be molded in order to realize the ideals of\nhis political position. His discussion of moral\n“dispositions” in the 10th Collection is an example of\nsuch theorizing—concerning the ways in which, rather\nthan the causal means by which. Some of his extensive\ntheorizing about causal means (education, exemplary individuals, laws,\nliterature, and so on) has already been discussed earlier in this\narticle. \nThese two sorts of political theorizing—empirical\ntheorizing and theorizing about moral sentiments—are\ndeeply developed in Herder. And they arguably have much more point\nthan the sorts that are not. \nIn short, to the extent that Herder’s political philosophy\nreally is theoretically superficial, it is, to borrow a phrase of\nNietzsche’s, “superficial—out of\nprofundity” (whereas more familiar forms of political\nphilosophy are profound—out of superficiality). And in another,\nmore important, sense it is not theoretically superficial at all. \nIn Herder’s day German philosophy was still deeply committed to\na sort of game of trying to reconcile the insights of the\nEnlightenment, especially those of modern natural science, with\nreligion, and indeed more specifically with Christianity. Leibniz,\nKant, Hegel, Schleiermacher, and many others played this\ngame—each proposing some new reconciliation or other. Herder was\npart of this game as well. This was not a good game for philosophers\nto be playing. But it was not until the nineteenth century that German\nphilosophy found the courage to cut the Gordian knot and turn from\napologetics for religion and Christianity to thoroughgoing criticism\nof them (the prime examples being Marx and Nietzsche). This situation\nimposes certain limits on the value of Herder’s philosophy of\nreligion (as on that of the other reconciling philosophers just\nmentioned). \nAlso, it should be noted that while Herder’s philosophy of\nreligion was generally very enlightened and progressive in both his\nearly and his late periods, there was a spell in the middle, the years\n1771–6 in Bückeburg, during which he fell into the sort of\nreligious irrationalism (an approach that rejects reason and instead\nbases religious views on belief alone) that is more characteristic of\nhis friend Hamann. This happened as the result of what would today be\nclassified as a mild nervous breakdown (documentable from his\ncorrespondence at the time), and should basically be discounted. \nNotwithstanding these qualifications, Herder did make important\ncontributions to the philosophy of religion—that is, important\nin terms of their intrinsic value, their influence, or both. \nOne of these contributions (important mainly for its influence) lies\nin his neo-Spinozism. Herder’s sympathetic engagement with\nSpinoza’s work goes back at least as far as 1769. But its main\nexpression occurs in God: Some Conversations from 1787.\nHerder published this work in the wake of Jacobi’s Letters\non the Doctrine of Spinoza (1785), in which Jacobi had revealed\nthat the highly respected philosopher, critic, and dramatist\nLessing—who was much admired by Herder in particular—had\nconfessed to him shortly before his death that he had abandoned\northodox religious conceptions in favor of Spinozism. Jacobi had\nhimself argued, sharply to the contrary, that Spinozism, and indeed\nall fundamental reliance on reason, implies atheism and fatalism, and\nshould therefore be rejected in favor of a leap of faith to a\nconventional Christian theism. Jacobi’s work, along with a reply\nby Moses Mendelssohn that disputed the attribution of Spinozism to\nLessing though not the perniciousness of such a position, caused a\npublic furor. In God: Some Conversations Herder intervened.\nIn this work he supports Lessing as Jacobi had characterized him by\ndeveloping a version of “Spinozism” that modifies the\noriginal in some significant respects, largely with a view to defusing\nJacobi’s objections. \nHerder shares with Spinoza the basic thesis of monism, and\nlike Spinoza equates the single, all-encompassing principle in\nquestion with God (which of course already calls into question\nJacobi’s charge of atheism). But whereas Spinoza had\ncharacterized this single, all-encompassing principle as\nsubstance, Herder instead characterizes it as force,\nor primal force. This fundamental modification involves\nseveral further ones that Herder also finds attractive, including the\nfollowing: (1) Whereas Spinoza had tended to conceive the principle in\nquestion as an inactive thing, Herder’s revision rather\nturns it into an activity. (2) Spinoza’s theory had\nattributed thought to the principle in question, but had\nrejected conceptions that it had intentions or was a\nmind. By contrast, Herder claims that it does have\nintentions. And since his general philosophy of mind identifies the\nmind with force, his identification of the principle in question with\nforce also carries an implication that it is a mind (he does\nnot yet quite say this in God: Some Conversations, but a few\nyears later in On the Spirit of Christianity of 1798 he\nexplicitly describes God as a Geist, a mind). In these ways,\nHerder in effect re-mentalizes Spinoza’s God (thereby further\nundermining Jacobi’s charge of atheism). (3) Whereas Spinoza had\nconceived nature mechanistically, in keeping with his Cartesian\nintellectual heritage (and had thereby invited Jacobi’s charge\nof fatalism), Herder (though officially still agnostic about what\nforce is) rather tends to conceive the forces at work in nature as\nliving, or organic (a conception of them that he mainly owes\nto Leibniz). (4) Herder believes that Spinoza’s original theory\ncontained an objectionable residue of dualism (again inherited from\nDescartes) in its conception of the relation between God’s two\nknown attributes, thought and extension (and similarly, in its\nconception of the relation between finite minds and bodies).\nBy contrast, Herder’s own conception of God as a force (and of\nfinite minds as likewise forces) is designed to overcome this alleged\nresidual dualism. For forces are of their very nature expressed in the\nbehavior of extended bodies. (5) Herder also sketches a more detailed\naccount of nature as a system of living forces based in the primal\nforce, God—an account that in particular ascribes an important\nrole in this system to the sort of opposition between forces that is\nexemplified by the magnet, and characterizes the system as a\nself-development toward higher and higher forms of articulation. \nDuring the last quarter or so of the eighteenth century and then well\ninto the nineteenth century a wave of neo-Spinozism swept through\nGerman philosophy and literature: in addition to Lessing and Herder,\nfurther neo-Spinozists included Goethe, Schelling, Hegel,\nSchleiermacher, Hölderlin, Novalis, and Friedrich Schlegel. This\nwave was largely a result of Herder’s embrace of neo-Spinozism\nin God: Some Conversations (and in Goethe’s case, of\nHerder’s sympathy with Spinozism even before that work).\nAccordingly, it for the most part took over Herder’s\nmodifications of Spinoza’s position. \nHowever, Herder’s most intrinsically valuable\ncontribution to the philosophy of religion concerns the interpretation\nof the Bible. In this connection, as has already been mentioned, he\nchampions a strict secularism. This was already his position\nin the 1760s. At that period he argued firmly, in the spirit of\nGalileo, for disallowing revelation any jurisdiction over natural\nscience—though he did so not in an anti-religious spirit but in\nthe hope and expectation that an autonomous natural science would\nconfirm religion. And he made a parallel case for the autonomy of\ninterpretation: Religious assumptions and means have no\nbusiness interfering in the interpretation of texts either, even when\nthe texts are sacred ones. Instead, even the Bible must be interpreted\nas the work of human beings, and by means of the same sorts of\nrigorous hermeneutic methods that are employed for interpreting other\nancient texts—any religious enlightenment coming as a\nresult of such interpretation, not entering into the process\nitself. This whole position remained Herder’s considered\nposition in his later period as well. \nThe general principle that the Bible should be interpreted in the same\nway as other texts was not the commonplace in Herder’s day that\nit has become since, but nor was it entirely new with him. In adopting\nit he was self-consciously following the lead of several recent Bible\nscholars—in particular, Ernesti, Michaelis, and Semler. However,\nhis secularism is more consistent and radical than theirs, in\nparticular because it foreswears not only any reliance on a divine\ninspiration of the interpreter but also any assumption that the Bible,\nas the word of God, must be true and consistent throughout. (For\nfurther details, see Section 6 of the\n Supplementary Discussion.)\n  \nAnother important interpretive principle of Herder’s, closely\nrelated to his strict secularism, is an insistence that interpreters\nof the Bible must resist the temptation to read the Bible as\nallegory (except in those relatively few cases—such as\nthe parables of the New Testament—where there is clear textual\nevidence that a biblical author intended to convey an allegorical\nmeaning). In On God’s Son, the World’s Savior\n(1797) Herder gives a perceptive general diagnosis of how the\ntemptation to allegorical interpretation arises: over the course of\nhistory people’s beliefs and values change, leading to\ndiscrepancies between the claims made by their traditional texts and\ntheir own beliefs and values; but they expect and want to find their\ntraditional texts to be correct; and so they try to effect a\nreconciliation of them with their own beliefs and values by means of\nallegorical readings. \nHerder’s theoretical commitment to strict secularism and to\nnon-allegorical readings in biblical interpretation led him to\ninterpretive discoveries concerning the Bible that were themselves of\ngreat importance. For example, concerning the Old Testament, his\ncommitment to applying normal interpretive methods enabled him to\ndistinguish and define the different genres of poetry in the Old\nTestament in a way that was superior to anything that had been\nachieved before. The same commitment, and his consequent readiness to\nfind falsehood and even inconsistency in the Bible, allowed him to\nmake such important interpretive observations as that the ancient\nHebrews’ conceptions about death, the afterlife, the mind, and\nthe body had changed dramatically over time. (For both of these\nachievements, see especially On the Spirit of Hebrew Poetry.)\nAnd his rejection of unwarranted allegorical interpretations allowed\nhim to substitute for the prevailing interpretation of the Song of\nSolomon as religious allegory an interpretation of it as simple\nerotic love poetry that is today generally accepted as correct. \nSimilarly concerning the New Testament, Herder’s commitment to\napplying normal interpretive methods, including his readiness to\ndiscover falsehood and inconsistency, enabled him to treat the authors\nof the four gospels as individual human authors rather than as mere\nmouthpieces of the deity, to perceive inconsistencies between their\naccounts, to establish the relative dates of the gospels correctly for\nthe first time (Mark first, Matthew and Luke in the middle, John last\nand late), and to give a broadly correct account of their genesis in\noral sermon and of their likely relations to each other (achievements\nthat he attained above all in two late works from 1796–7, On\nthe Savior of Mankind and On God’s Son, the\nWorld’s Savior). \nHerder’s strict secularism and resistance to allegory in\ninterpretation would shortly afterwards be adopted by Schleiermacher,\nwho similarly embraced the principle that the interpretation of sacred\ntexts must treat them as the works of human authors and apply exactly\nthe same interpretive methods to them as are applied to profane texts,\nand who similarly followed through on this commitment, in particular\nfinding not only falsehoods but also inconsistencies in the Bible. \nHerder’s great achievements in this whole area also have\nsomething of the character of the early acts of an inexorable personal\ntragedy, however. As was mentioned, he did not by any means intend his\nchampioning of the cause of intellectual conscience in insisting on\nthe autonomy of natural science and interpretation to undermine\nreligion in general or Christianity in particular; on the contrary,\nhis hope and expectation was that both sorts of autonomy would in the\nend support religion and Christianity. However, this hope has been\nsorely disappointed. Autonomous natural science has increasingly made\nreligion generally and Christianity in particular look\nproblematic. And Herder’s policy of reading the Bible with the\naid of normal interpretive means as a collection of human texts, with\nall of the foibles of human texts, has increasingly led to an\nundermining of the Bible’s claims to intellectual authority (a\nlandmark here was the publication of David Friedrich\nStrauss’s The Life of Jesus (1835–6)). Much of\nwhat Herder has ultimately achieved in this area would therefore be\ndeeply unwelcome to him. \nNow that we have surveyed Herder’s main achievements as a\nphilosopher, we are in a better position to see not only their\nintrinsic value but also their enormous intellectual influence, as\nadumbrated at the start of this article—an influence that\noccurred both within philosophy and beyond it, and that extended even\nto the founding of whole new disciplines.
