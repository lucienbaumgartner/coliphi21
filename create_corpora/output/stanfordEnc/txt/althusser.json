As\nthey seemed to offer a renewal of Marxist thought as well as to render\nMarxism philosophically respectable, the claims he advanced in the\n1960s about Marxist philosophy were discussed and debated\nworldwide. Due to apparent reversals in his theoretical positions, to\nthe ill-fated facts of his life, and to the historical fortunes of\nMarxism in the late twentieth century, this intense interest in\nAlthusser’s reading of Marx did not survive the 1970s. Despite the\ncomparative indifference shown to his work as a whole after these\nevents, the theory of ideology Althusser developed within it has been\nbroadly deployed in the social sciences and humanities and has\nprovided a foundation for much “post-Marxist”\nphilosophy. In addition, aspects of Althusser’s project have served as\ninspiration for Analytic Marxism as well as for Critical Realism and\nPhilosophy of Language. Though this influence is not always explicit,\nAlthusser’s work and that of his students continues to inform the\nresearch programs of literary studies, political philosophy, history,\neconomics, and sociology. In addition, his autobiography has been\nsubject to much critical attention over the last decade. At present,\nAlthusser’s philosophy as a whole is undergoing a critical\nreevaluation by scholars who have benefited from the anthologization\nof hard-to-find and previously unpublished texts and who have begun to\nengage with the great mass of writings that remain in his\narchives. His concepts are also being increasingly employed by\nphilosophers, political theorists, and activists who have returned to\nMarx and to Marxian analyses in order to explain and to envision\nalternatives to our present socio-economic conjuncture. \n\n\n\nLouis Althusser was born on October 16th, 1918 in\nBirmandreis, a suburb of Algiers. Hailing from Alsace on his\nfather’s side of the family, his grandparents were pieds\nnoirs, or French citizens who had chosen to settle in Algeria. At\nthe time of his birth, Althusser’s father was a lieutenant in the\nFrench Military. After this service was up, his father returned to\nAlgiers and to his work as a banker. By all accounts save for the\nretrospective ones contained in his autobiographies, Althusser’s\nearly childhood in North Africa was a contented one. There he enjoyed\nthe comforts of the Mediterranean environment as well as those provided\nby an extended and stable petit-bourgeois family. \n\nIn 1930, his father’s work moved the family to Marseille.\nAlways a good pupil, Althusser excelled in his studies and became\nactive in the Scouts. In 1936, the family moved again, this time to\nLyon. There, Althusser was enrolled in the prestigious Lycée du\nParc. At the Lycée, he began taking classes in order to prepare\nfor the competitive entrance exams to France’s grandes\nécoles. Raised in an observant family, Althusser was\nparticularly influenced by professors of a distinctly Catholic\ntendency. These included the philosophers Jean Guitton and Jean Lacroix\nas well as the historian Joseph Hours. In 1937, while still at the\nLycée, Althusser joined the Catholic youth group Jeunesse\nétudiantes chrétiennes. This interest in Catholicism\nand his participation in Catholic organizations would continue even\nafter Althusser joined the Communist Party in 1948. The simultaneous\nenthusiasm that Althusser showed in Lyon for Royalist politics did not\nlast the war. \n\nIn 1939, Althusser performed well enough on the national entrance\nexaminations to be admitted to the École Normale\nSupérieure (ENS) in Paris. However, before the school year\nbegan, he was mobilized into the army. Soon thereafter, he was captured\nin Vannes along with the rest of his artillery regiment. He spent the\nremainder of the war as a prisoner of war at a camp in Northern\nGermany. In his autobiographical writings, Althusser credits the\nexperiences of solidarity, political action, and community that he\nfound in the camp as opening him up to the idea of communism. Indeed,\nhis prison writings collected as Journal de captivité,\nStalag XA 1940–1945 evidence these experiences. They also provide\nevidence of the cycles of deep depression that began for Althusser in\n1938 and that would mark him for the rest of his life. \n\nAt the end of the war and following his release from the P.O.W.\ncamp in 1945, Althusser took his place at the ENS. Now 27 years old, he\nbegan the program of study that was to prepare him for the\nagrégation, the competitive examination which qualifies\none to teach philosophy in French secondary schools and that is often\nthe gateway to doctoral study and university employment. Perhaps not\nsurprisingly for a young man who had just spent half a decade in a\nprison camp, much happened during the three years he spent preparing\nfor the exam and working on his Master’s thesis. Though still\ninvolved in Catholic groups and still seeing himself as a Christian,\nthe movements that Althusser associated with after the war were leftist\nin their politics and, intellectually, he made a move to embrace and\nsynthesize Christian and Marxist thought. This synthesis and his first\npublished works were informed by a reading of 19th Century\nGerman idealist philosophy, especially Hegel and Marx, as well as by\nprogressive Christian thinkers associated with the group Jeunesse\nde l’Église. Indeed, it was 19th Century\nGerman Idealism with which he was most engaged during his period of\nstudy at the ENS. In line with this interest (one shared with many\nother French intellectuals at the time), Althusser obtained his\ndiplôme d’études supérieures in 1947\nfor a work directed by Gaston Bachelard and titled “On Content in\nthe Thought of G.W.F. Hegel.” In 1948, he passed his\nagrégation, coming in first on the written portion of\nthe exam and second on the oral. After this showing, Althusser was\noffered and accepted the post of agrégé\nrépétiteur (director of studies) at the ENS whose\nresponsibility it was to help students prepare for their own\nagrégations. In this capacity, he began offering\ncourses and tutorials on particular topics in philosophy and on\nparticular figures from the history of philosophy. As he retained this\nresponsibility for more than thirty years and worked with some of the\nbrightest thinkers that France produced during this time (including\nAlain Badiou, Pierre Bourdieu, and Michel Foucault), through his\nteaching Althusser left a deep and lasting impression on a generation\nof French philosophers and on French philosophy. \n\nIn addition to inaugurating his extended association with the ENS,\nthe first few years spent in Paris after the war saw Althusser begin\nthree other long-lasting relationships. The first of these was\nwith the French Communist Party, the second with his companion and\neventual wife, Hélène Rytman, and the third with French\npsychiatry. Begun to treat recurrent bouts of depression, this last\naffiliation continued for the rest of his life and included frequent\nhospitalization as well as the most aggressive treatments post-war\nFrench psychiatry had to offer such as electroconvulsive therapy,\nnarco-analysis, and psychoanalysis. \n\nThe second relationship begun by Althusser was little happier and no\nless dependent than the first. At its outset, Althusser’s bond\nwith Hélène Rytman was complicated by his almost total\ninexperience with women and by her being eight years older than him. It was\nalso made difficult by the vast differences in their experience of the\nworld and by her relationship with the Communist Party. Whereas\nAlthusser had known only home, school, and P.O.W. camp, Rytman had\ntraveled widely and had long been active in literary and radical\ncircles. At the time the two met, she was also embroiled in a dispute\nwith the Party over her role in the resistance during World War II. \n\nThough Althusser was not yet a Party member, like many of his\ngeneration, he emerged from the War deeply sympathetic to its moral\naims. His interest in Party politics and involvement with Party members\ngrew during his time as a student at the ENS. However, the ENS’\nsuspicion of communists as well as Hélène Rytman’s\ntroubles with the Party complicated Althusser’s relationship with\neach of these institutions. Nonetheless, shortly after\nbeing offered the post of agrégé\nrépétiteur (and thus safe from being bypassed for\nthe position due to his membership), Althusser joined the Communist\nParty. For the next few years, Althusser tried to advance the aims of\nthe Communist Party as well as the goal of getting Rytman accepted back\ninto it. He did so by being a good militant (going to cell\nmeetings, distributing tracts, etc), by re-starting a Marxist study\ngroup at the ENS (the Cercle Politzer), and by making\ninquiries into Rytman’s wartime activities in the hopes of\nclearing her name. By his own account, he made a terrible activist and\nhe also failed to rehabilitate Rytman’s reputation. Nonetheless,\nhis relationship with the Party and with Rytman deepened during this\nperiod. \n\nDuring the 1950s, Althusser lived two lives that were only somewhat\ninter-related: one was that of a successful, if somewhat obscure\nacademic philosopher and pedagogue and the other that of a loyal\nCommunist Party Member. This is not to say that Althusser was\npolitically inactive at the school or that his communism did not\ninfluence his philosophical work. On the contrary, Althusser\nrecruited colleagues and students to the Party and worked closely with\nthe communist cell based at the ENS. In addition, at mid-decade, he\npublished a few introductions to Marxist philosophy. However, in his\nteaching and advising, he mostly avoided bringing in Marxist philosophy\nand Communist politics. Instead, he catered to student interest and to\nthe demands of each new agrégation by engaging closely\nwith classic philosophical texts and with contemporary philosophy and\nsocial science. Further, the bulk of his scholarship was on\n18th Century political philosophy. Indeed, the only\nbook-length study Althusser published during his lifetime was a work on\nMontesquieu, which appeared at the end of the decade. At the ENS,\nAlthusser’s professionalism as well as his ability to think\ninstitutionally was rewarded in 1954 with a promotion to\nsecrétaire de l’école littéraire,\na post where he had some responsibility for the\nmanagement and direction of the school. \n\nIt would have surprised no one if Althusser had continued to\ninfluence French political and philosophical life subtly, through the\nstudents that he mentored, through his scholarship on the history of\npolitical philosophy, through the colloquia among philosophers,\nscientists, and historians that he organized, and through his routine\nwork as a Party member. However, in 1961, with an essay titled\n“On the Young Marx,” Althusser aggressively entered into a\nheated debate about the continuity of Marx’s oeuvre and about\nwhat constitutes the core of Marxist philosophy. Appearing at a time of\ncrisis in the French Communist Party’s direction and seeming to\noffer a “scientific” alternative to Stalinism and to the\nhumanist revisions of Marxism then being proffered, the theoretical\nviewpoint offered by Althusser gained adherents. Invigorated by this\nrecognition and by the possibility that theoretical work might actually\nchange Communist Party practice, Althusser began to publish regularly\non Marxist philosophy. These essays occasioned much public discussion\nand philosophical activity both in France and abroad. At the same time\nas these essays began creating a stir, Althusser changed his teaching\nstyle at the ENS and began to offer collaborative seminars where he and\nhis students attempted a “return to Marx” and to\nMarx’s original texts. In 1965, the fruit of one of these\nseminars was published as Reading Capital. That same year, the\nessays on Marxist theory that had made such a sensation were collected\nand published in the volume For Marx. Amplifying these\nbooks’ collective impact well beyond the realm of intra-party\ndiscussion was the general trend in literary and social scientific\ntheory labeled “structuralism” and with which\nAlthusser’s re-reading of Marx was identified. \n\nAt mid-decade, Althusser seized on these works’ popularity and the\nfact that his arguments had created a faction within the French\nCommunist Party composed mostly of young intelligentsia to try and\nforce change within the Party.  This gambit to have the Party\ndirected by theorists rather than by a Central Committee whose\nStalinism remained entrenched and who believed in the organic wisdom\nof the worker met with little success.  At the most, he succeeded in\ncarving out some autonomy for theoretical reflection within the\nParty. Even though it is his most well known intervention, this was\nnot the first attempt by Althusser to try and influence the Party (he\nhad tried once before during the mid 1950s from his position as cell\nleader at the ENS) and it would not be his last.  While he lost much\nof the student support that his work had created when he remained\nsilent during the “revolutionary” events of May 1968 (he\nwas in a psychiatric hospital at the time), he campaigned once more to\ninfluence the Party during the mid 1970s. This intervention occurred\nin response to the French Communist Party’s decision to abandon\ntraditional Marxist-Leninist aspects of its platform so as to better\nally itself with the Socialist Party. Though Althusser’s position was\nwell publicized and found its supporters, in the end, his arguments\nwere unable to motivate the Party’s rank-and-file such that its\nleadership would reconsider its decision. \n\nDuring the decades in which he became internationally known for his\nre-thinking of Marxist philosophy, Althusser continued in his post at\nthe ENS. There he took on increasing institutional responsibility\nwhile continuing to edit and, with François Maspero, to publish\nhis own work and that of others in the\nseries Théorie. In 1975, Althusser acquired the right\nto direct research on the basis of his previously published\nwork. Shortly after this recognition, he married his longtime\ncompanion, Hélène Rytman. \n\nFollowing the French Left’s and the Communist Party’s\nelectoral defeats in the 1978 elections, Althusser’s bouts of depression\nbecame more severe and more frequent. In November\n1980, after a painful surgery and another\nbout of mental illness, which saw him hospitalized for most of the\nsummer and whose symptoms continued after his return to the ENS in the\nfall, Althusser strangled his wife. Before he could be arrested for the\nmurder, he was sent to a mental hospital. Later, when an\nexamining magistrate came to inform him of the crime of which he was\naccused, Althusser was in so fragile a mental state that he could not\nunderstand the charges or the process to which he was to be submitted\nand he was left at the hospital. After an examination, a panel of\npsychiatrists concluded that Althusser was suffering at the time of the\nmurder from severe depression and iatrogenic hallucinations. Citing a\nFrench law (since changed), which states that “there is neither\ncrime nor delict where the suspect was in a state of dementia at the\ntime of the action,” the magistrate in charge of\nAlthusser’s case decided that there were no grounds on which to\npursue prosecution. \n\nThe last ten years of Althusser’s life were spent in and out of\nmental hospitals and at the apartment in Paris’ 20th\narrondissement where he had planned to retire. During this period, he\nwas visited by a few loyal friends and kept up some correspondences.\nGiven his mental state, his frequent institutionalizations, his anomie,\nand the drugs he was prescribed, these were not very productive years.\nHowever, at mid-decade, he did find the energy to re-visit some of his\nold work and to attempt to construct from it an explicit metaphysics.\nHe also managed to write an autobiography, a text he averred was\nintended to provide the explanation for the murder of his wife that he\nwas never able to provide in court. Both texts only appeared\nposthumously. When his mental and physical health deteriorated again in\n1987, Althusser went to live at a psychiatric hospital in La\nVerrière, a village to the west of Paris. There, on the\n22nd of October, 1990, he died of a heart attack \n\nDespite its being anthologized and translated during the mid 1990s,\nthere has until recently been relatively little critical attention\npaid to Althusser’s writings prior to 1961. Certainly, in terms of\nmethod, style, and inspiration, the Althusser found in these works\ndiffers significantly from the Althusser of For Marx and\nReading Capital. In his writings from the 1940s, for\ninstance, his method and conclusions resemble those of the Marxist\nHumanists of whom he would later be so critical, while texts from the\n1950s deploy without irony the Stalinist shibboleths he would later\nsubject to such castigation. Nonetheless, as these texts announce many\nof Althusser’s perennial themes and because some of the contradictions\nthese works possess are shared with his classic texts and are repeated\nagain in his late work, these early essays, books, and translations\nare worthy of examination \n\nAlthusser’s philosophical output between 1946 and 1961 can\nroughly be divided into four categories. The first category includes\nthose essays, mostly written between 1946 and 1951, where Althusser\nexplores possible rapports between Christianity and Marxism. In the\nfirst of these essays “The International of Decent\nFeelings,” Althusser argues from what he takes to be “the\ntruth of Christianity” against the popular post-war view that the\nmisery, guilt, and alienation of the human condition in the atomic age\nis equally experienced by all subjects. For him, this existentialist\ndiagnosis is a type of idolatry: it replaces recognition of our\nequality before God with our equality before the fear of death. In that\nit does so, it is twice anti-Christian. For, in addition to the sin of\nidolatry (death equals God), it fails to acknowledge the existence of a\nparticular class, the proletariat, for whom anguish is not its lot and\nwho is actually capable of delivering the emancipation from fear by\nre-appropriating the products of human production, including the atomic\nbomb. A subsequent essay from 1947, “A Matter of Fact,”\ncontinues in this vein, suggesting the necessity of socialist means for\nrealizing Christian ends. It also includes a Hegelian critique of the\nexisting Catholic Church which suggests that the church is incapable of\nsuch an alliance without a theological revolution. Each of these\nessays includes the suggestion that critique and reform will\noccasion a better church and a truer Christianity. By 1949, however,\nAlthusser was totally pessimistic about this possibility and, in a\nletter to his mentor Jean Lacroix, he argued that the sole possibility\nfor realizing Christian values is through communist action. Though some\ncritics have argued that Christian and Catholic values and modes of\nreasoning inform all of Althusser’s philosophy, any explicit\nconsideration of a practical and theoretical reconciliation between the\ntwo was abandoned at this point in Althusser’s development. \n\nThe second category of Althusser’s early work, one closely\nrelated to the first, are those texts that deal with Hegel. Written\nprimarily for an academic audience, they approach Hegel’s\nphilosophy either critically, in terms of the history of its reception\nand use, or exegetically, in terms of examining what possibility\nHegel’s metaphysics, logic, politics, epistemology, and\nunderstanding of subjectivity offer to those interested in\nunderstanding and encouraging societal transformation. Between 1946 and\n1950, the results of Althusser’s exegeses were positive: Hegel\nindeed had something to offer. This judgment finds its most detailed\nexplanation in Althusser’s 1947 thesis “On Content in the\nthought of G.W.F. Hegel.”  In addition to\ndetailing Hegel’s relation to Kant and criticizing the\nsimplification of the dialectic by Hegel’s commentators,\nAlthusser argues in this work that the dialectic “cannot be\nattacked for its form” (1947, 116). Instead, Hegel can only be\ncritiqued for a failure of the contents of the form (as these contents\nare specified in Hegel’s historical and political works) to have\nactually fulfilled the absolute idea. Following the Young Hegelians,\nthen, Althusser uses Hegel’s dialectic against itself to\ncriticize claims like the one made in The Philosophy of Right\nthat the Prussian state is the fulfillment of the dialectic. Though he\nuses Marx’s Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of\nRight to make his points and though he is in agreement with Marx\nthat the Hegelian concept, realized in thought, must now be realized in\nthe world, Althusser does not suggest in his thesis that\nMarx’s philosophy leaves Hegel’s insights about, history,\nlogic, and the subject behind. Instead, he contends\nthat Marx is guilty of committing the same error as Hegel in mistaking\nhistorical content for the fulfillment of the dialectic. Because all\nknowledge is historical, Althusser argues, Marxists can only correct\nfor this error by appeal to the idea of the dialectic and to its end in\nthe absolute and the eternal, to a time “when the human totality\nwill be reconciled with its own structure” (1947, 156). Something\nlike this argument will appear again in his classical work as a\ncritique of the empiricist tendency in Marxist philosophy. \n\nBy the early 1950s, Althusser’s judgments that Marxism was, of\nnecessity, Hegelian and that it aimed at human fulfillment had\nundergone revision. This transition to thinking about Marx as the\noriginator of a philosophy totally distinct from Hegel’s was signaled\nin a review essay from 1950 which argued that the post-war mania for\nHegel in France was only a bourgeois attempt to combat Marx.  In two\nshort essays from 1953 on Marxist philosophy, this switch is fully\napparent. In these texts, Althusser aligns himself with the position\nadvanced by Mehring and Lenin that, at a certain point in Marx’s\ndevelopment, Hegel is left behind and that, afterwards, Marx forged\nhis own original concepts and methodology. In his description of what\nthese concepts and methodology are, Althusser pretty much follows the\nParty line, insisting that Marx reversed the Hegelian dialectic, that\nhistorical materialism is a science, that the sciences verify\ndialectical materialism, and that the proletariat needs to be taught\nMarxist science from above. Though these essays repeat the Party\nphilosophy as formulated by Lenin, Stalin, and Zhdanov, they also\ninclude recognizable Althusserian themes and show his thinking about\nthese themes to be in transition. For instance, both essays retain the\nidea from Althusser’s 1947 thesis about the quasi-transcendental\nstatus of present scientific knowledge. Both also anticipate future\nconcerns in their speculations about the ideological character of\ncurrent scientific knowledge and in their incorporation of ideas from\nMao about the relationship between theory and practice. Written as a\nresponse to Paul Ricoeur and representing the last example of this\nthird category of Althusser’s early work, a text from 1955 argues for\nthe objectivity of historical science. This is a theme to which he\nwould return. Noticeably absent from this body of work, however, are\nthe detailed and original claims Althusser would make in the early\n1960s about Marx’s philosophy. \n\nTwo essays that Althusser wrote in the mid 1950s were the first to\nfocus exclusively on Marxist philosophy and are interesting inasmuch\nas they evidence his rejection of Hegel and his embrace of the\nParty’s Marxism-Leninism. In addition, these texts suggest the\nneed for a thorough study of Marx. This study, however, would wait\nuntil the beginning of the next decade. For the rest of the 1950s,\nmost of Althusser’s published work involved the study of\nphilosophical figures who preceded Marx. These figures included\nMontesquieu, on whose political philosophy and theory of history he\nwrote a book-length study, and Feuerbach, whose writings he translated\nand commented upon.  The dual thesis of Althusser’s Montesquieu\nbook: that, insofar as Montesquieu studies the “concrete\nbehavior of men” he resists idealism and inaugurates the study\nof history as a science and that, insofar as Montesquieu accepts past\nand present political formations as delimiting the possibilities for\npolitical life, he remains an idealist, is one that will find echoes\nin Althusser’s study of Marx during the next decade. Similarly,\ninasmuch as he makes the argument in a commentary (1960) that part of\nhis intention in translating Feuerbach is to show just what Marx owes\nin his early writings to the author of The Essence of\nChristianity so that these may be better seen as absent from\nMarx’s mature work, these studies of Feuerbach can also be seen\nas propaedeutic to the study of Marx which Althusser inaugurated in\n1961 with his article “On the Young Marx”. \n\nWith the perspective afforded by the mass of posthumous writings\npublished since the 1990s, it has become clear that Althusser was\nperennially concerned with important issues in metaphysics,\nepistemology, philosophy of science, historiography, hermeneutics, and\npolitical philosophy. However, it is also true that the primary medium\nAlthusser employed for thinking through problems in these areas was\nMarxist philosophy. This is especially true of the period between 1961\nand 1966 when the majority of his published and unpublished work\nconcerned itself with how to read Marx, the definition of Marxist\nphilosophy, and how to understand and apply Marxian concepts. In\naddition, if we are to take Althusser’s retrospective word for\nit, the pieces he published during this period were intended as\npolitical-theoretical acts, polemics meant to respond to contemporary\nopinions and policies and to shift the terms of these arguments as well\nas the actions which were their results. For these reasons, it is\nnatural when discussing these texts to focus upon the contexts that\nengendered them and upon the positions within Marxist philosophy that\nAlthusser stakes out by their means. Alternatively, as Althusser\nindicates in many of these pieces his debts to contemporaneous\ntheorists and to philosophical predecessors such as Spinoza, there is\nthe temptation to understand his thought as a combination of the\ninsights contributed by these thinkers with Marxist philosophy. While\neach is a useful approach to understanding and explaining\nAlthusser’s philosophy, when excessive attention is paid to one\nor another of them, one risks historicizing his contributions or\nsuggesting that they are merely derivative. Seeking to avoid either\nresult, even though the following discussion will note the context for\nAlthusser’s work, its relation to Marxist philosophy, and the\nnon-Marxist philosophical insights that contribute to its method and\nconclusions, this account will also suggest the uniqueness of his\ncontributions to hermeneutics, metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of\nscience, historiography, and political philosophy. \n\nFor multiple, overlapping, and complicated reasons of which the most\nrelevant may be the discrediting of Stalin’s personage, policies,\nand version of Marxist philosophy that followed Khrushchev’s\n“Secret Speech,” Europe in the late 1950s\nsaw a blossoming of political and philosophical alternatives to the\nversion of Marxism-Leninism promulgated by the Soviet Union. This\nversion of Marxist philosophy had dominated European leftist thought\nand action since the dawn of the Cold War in 1947 and, in France, was\nwidely disseminated via Communist Party schools and literature. While\npolitical and philosophical change were slow to occur in the French\nCommunist Party, by the late 1950s, many intellectuals associated with\nthe Party began to ask questions about what constitutes the core of\nMarx’s philosophy and about how this philosophy guides, relates\nto, or allows for political action. \n\nFor many of these intellectuals, answering this question meant a\nreturn to Marx’s early work (those texts written before 1845) in\nthe hopes of finding the “key” to his philosophy. In pieces\nlike “Contribution to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of\nRight” (1844), and the Economic and Philosophic\nManuscripts (1844), these thinkers found and championed a Marx\nobviously indebted to a Hegelian dialectical understanding of\nsubjectivity and historical development and deeply concerned about\nending human alienation. It is to this project—that of finding\nthe true method, aim, and intent of Marx’s philosophy in his\nearly work’s emphasis on the realization of full human freedom\nand potentials through dialectical historical change—that\nAlthusser made the first of his public “interventions” into\nMarxist philosophy. He inaugurated this effort with the essay “On\nthe Young Marx” (1961), which sought to demonstrate that this\nmethod of looking to Marx’s early work for the key to his\nphilosophy was methodologically suspect and ideologically driven.\nFurther, in this essay and in subsequent work, he developed an\nalternate method of investigation or “reading” that would\nallow Marx’s true philosophy to be revealed in its purity. \n\nFrom the fruits of this new method of reading, Althusser argued that\nnot only was Marx the originator of a new philosophy, Dialectical\nMaterialism, that had nothing to do with its Hegelian and Feuerbachian\npredecessors, but that he also founded a new science, Historical\nMaterialism, which broke with and superseded such ideological and\npre-scientific precursors as the political economics of Smith and\nRicardo. For the most part, the essays collected in For Marx\n(1965) and the seminar papers issued as Reading Capital (1965)\ndevelop and utilize this method of reading in order to justify and\ndescribe Marxist philosophy and Marxist science as well as to\ndistinguish between these two theoretical activities. In so doing,\nAlthusser says quite a bit about the nature of knowledge and the\ngeneral relations between philosophy, science, politics, and ideology.\nFurther, Althusser applies this hermeneutic method to argue against\nwhat he labeled “empiricist” understandings of Marx. These\nincluded the Humanist interpretations of Marx described above as well\nas variations on the orthodox Marxist-Leninist theory, which specified\nthe strict determination of culture and history by the existing modes\nof economic exchange and resulting class struggles. The following\nparagraphs discuss this theory of reading, how it produces a different\nunderstanding of Marx’s philosophy than that which is derived\nfrom Humanist and Economist readings, and how it informs his\nepistemology, philosophy of science, historiography, and political\nphilosophy. \n\nThe label that Althusser gave to the method by which he approached\nMarx’s texts was that of a “symptomatic reading.”\nInstead of looking back at Marx’s early work in order to find the\n“essence” of his philosophy, one of whose expressions was\nCapital, and also instead of trying to build a true or\nconsistent theory out of Marx’s oeuvre by explaining away\ncontradictions within it and noting certain passages as key, Althusser\nargued that Marx’s true philosophy was largely absent from his\nwork prior to 1845. Even in mature texts such as Capital,\nAlthusser maintained that Marx’s philosophy remained largely\nimplicit, as the background system of concepts which allowed the\nscientific work Marx was involved in generating to take place. The\nsymptomatic method of reading was designed to make these concepts\nexplicit and “to establish the indispensable minimum for the\nconsistent existence of Marxist philosophy”\n(1965a [2005], 35). \n\nThe three inspirations Althusser gave for this interpretive method\nwere those provided by Spinoza, Freud by way of Lacan, and that\nprovided by Marx himself. In addition, he added to these examples\ninsights from the French tradition of historical epistemology about the\nway in which sciences come to be constituted. One of the ideas borrowed\nfrom Spinoza was the contention that texts and authors are the products\nof their times and that the thoughts authors set down on the page\ncannot help but be a part of, and be affected by, the ideological\ncurrents that accompany and allow for the satisfaction of needs in a\nspecific era. So then, similar to the way in which Spinoza argued in\nthe Theological Political-Treatise that by engaging in a\nmaterialist historical study of the Bible one could disentangle those\nprophetic laws and commands which were merely the result of temporal\nexigencies and the prophet’s imagination from those which\nrepresented the true word of God, so Althusser argued that one could\ndisentangle those concepts which were merely ideological in\nMarx’s texts from those which comprised his true philosophy. \n\nThough this theory was later to be complicated and revised, during\nthis period, Althusser consistently argued that Marx’s work prior to\n1845 was ideological and that it was saturated with non-Marxian\nconcepts borrowed from Hegel’s and Feuerbach’s philosophical\nanthropologies. Althusser did recognize that some of Marx’s early work\nis marked by its rejection of idealist premises and concepts. However,\ninasmuch as this early work was seen to espouse a telic view of\nhumanity in which the individual and society was said to undergo a\nnecessary historico-dialectical development, Althusser identified it\nas fundamentally Hegelian. That there was a materialist correction to\nthis basic narrative with Marx’s embrace of Feuerbach, Althusser also\ngranted. However, the replacement by Marx of a speculative\nanthropology which saw the historical development of society as the\nself-fulfillment of human freedom with a materialist anthropology that\ncited the same logic of development but which specified that the motor\nof this development was human beings in their “sensuous life\nactivity,” was seen by Althusser to represent little conceptual\nand no logical advance from Hegel. \n\nThis “theory of the break,” which held that Marx’s early\nwork was Hegelian and ideological and that, after a decisive rupture\nin 1845 and then a long period of transition between 1845–1857,\nhis work became recognizably Marxist and scientific, would seem to\nindicate that all one has to do to understand Marx’s philosophy is to\nread this mature work. However, the actual case is not so\nsimple. While reading Capital and other late works is\nnecessary for understanding Marx’s philosophy, it is not\nsufficient. It is not sufficient, Althusser argued, because, even in\nhis post-1857 writings, Marx provides no systematic exposition of his\nepistemology or his ideas about social structure, history, and human\nnature, all of which were necessary for Marxist philosophy’s\nconsistent and continuing existence. \n\nMany interpreters of Marx, and not just those Althusser directly\nengaged with during the early 1960s, have maintained that such texts as\nthe 1859 Preface and the 1844 Manuscripts provide\nkeys to understanding Marx’s philosophy. However, Althusser made\nthe case that these texts were contradictory and insufficient for this\npurpose. It is with this contention that the models provided by\npsychoanalysis and by Marx’s own critique of classical political\neconomy come to inform Althusser’s overall hermeneutic strategy.\nPart of this strategy, Althusser maintains, is directly taken from\nMarx’s own method. Thus, in a way parallel to Marx pointing out\nin Capital V.II (1885) that Adam Smith needed the concept of\nthe “value of labor” for his explanations of capitalist\neconomic activity but could not fully generate it out of the systems of\nideas available to him, Althusser argued that, though Marx was\nrecognizably engaged in the work of Historical Materialism in\nCapital, the philosophical theory or background conceptual\nframework that allowed this investigation to proceed was not fully\narticulated. \n\nThe explicit project of Reading Capital and of many of the\nessays included in For Marx was to make these fundamental\nconcepts explicit. It was to do so by paying attention to the\ntheoretical “problematic,” or background ideological\nframework in which the work was generated, by analyzing those passages\nwhere a philosophical concept had to have been in use but was not made\nexplicit, and by noting and explaining where and why one theoretical\npronouncement is in contradiction with itself or with another passage.\nFor Althusser, such areas of Marx’s text are “symptoms,”\nin the psychoanalytic sense of the word, of the necessary but\nunarticulated philosophical framework that underwrites and allows his\nscientific investigations. Of these frameworks, Marx was not fully\nconscious. However, they were what allowed him to investigate and\ndescribe such socio-economic events as the transformation of money\ninto capital without recourse to Hegelian logic and\nconcepts. Althusser argues that by paying attention to these passages\nin Marx’s text as well as by seeking out Marxist concepts as these\nwere developed during the course of practical Marxist activity by\ntheorists such as Lenin and Mao, an attentive reader can render\nexplicit Marx’s philosophy.  \n\nThat the concepts Althusser derived from his symptomatic reading of\nMarx, Lenin, and Mao were Marxist concepts was avowed. Nevertheless,\nAlthusser also acknowledged that some of the concepts found latent in\nthese texts were derived from and consistent with his philosophical\nand social scientific contemporaries as well as with those of\nSpinoza. Of course, this is not inconsistent with the theory of\nreading and authorship that underwrites a symptomatic reading of a\ntext. Inasmuch as authors and readers are always said to think with\nconcepts borrowed from or supplied by the problematic that they\ninhabit, there is no such thing as an innocent or objective reading:\nwe understand things with and through the concepts available to us.\nPerhaps nowhere is this borrowing more evident than in Althusser’s\nideas about how scientific and philosophic knowledge is\ngenerated. Though Althusser is very careful to back up his arguments\nabout Marx’s epistemology with close analyses of Marx’s work, it is\napparent that the model for knowledge acquisition that is developed\nin Reading Capital owes much to Spinoza and to the French\ntradition of historical epistemology. \n\nWith his re-reading of Marx, Althusser wished to offer an\nalternative to the two then dominant understandings of Marx’s\nphilosophy. Both understandings were charged with the same mistake.\nThis mistake was, fundamentally, an epistemological one: each cast Marx\nas an empiricist. At first glance, this charge might seem ridiculous.\nThis is especially the case as, according to Althusser’s own\ncritique, both understandings of Marx offered variants of the Hegelian\nclaim that there is a reason to history. For Althusser, however, both\nreadings were “empiricist” inasmuch as each ascribed to\nMarx a theory of knowledge in which the subject, by means of a process\nof observation and abstraction, comes to know what an object really and\ntruly is, according to its essence. This is a definition of empiricism\nmeant to include philosophers as diverse as Locke, Kant, and Hegel and\ntraditions as varied as British Empiricism, German Idealism,\nPositivism, and Pragmatism. In the case of Humanist Marxism, the object\nthat comes to be known by its essence is the human subject in its full\nfreedom. It does so by means of critique and by creatively overcoming\nthat which is alien to it or “merely historical.” In\nthe case of orthodox Marxism-Leninism, this object is the economy, the\nreality that underlies, causes, and can explain all historical\nstructures and transformations. The economy comes to be known as it\ntruly is only by the proletariat, by those whom the historical process\nhas endowed with an objective gaze and who possess the ability to make\nthis truth objective. \n\nIn opposition to the empiricist model of knowledge production,\nAlthusser proposes that true or scientific knowledge is distinguished\nfrom ideology or opinion not by dint of an historical subject having\nabstracted the essence of an object from its appearances. Instead, this\nknowledge is understood to be produced by a process internal to\nscientific knowledge itself. Though this transformation takes place\nentirely in thought, Althusser does not maintain that scientific\nknowledge makes no use of facts. However, these facts or materials are\nnever brute. Rather, specific sciences start with pre-existing concepts\nor genera such as “humors,” “unemployment,”\n“quasars,” or “irrational numbers.” These\ngenera may be ideological in part or in whole. Science’s job is\nto render these concepts scientific. This labor is what Althusser terms\n“theoretical practice.” The result of this practice is\nscientific knowledge. Scientific knowledge is produced by means of\napplying to these genera the body of concepts or “theory”\nthat the science possesses for understanding them. This body of\nconcepts may be more or less unified and consistent and it may be more\nor less consciously articulated. Further, the sum of the individual\nconcepts that this theory consists of delimits the possible ways in\nwhich the genera that a science begins with can be understood. \n\nWhen applied, a science’s theory weeds out ideological notions\nassociated with the original concept or genera. The result of this\napplication of theory to genera is the transformation of the\n“ideological generality into a scientific generality”\n(1963b [2005], 185). An example of such a process is the\ntransformation in medical science of a concept like “phlegmatic\nhumors” into the idea of blood-borne pathogens by dint of the\ntheory of circulation and infectious disease. Once generated, such\nscientific concepts inform regular scientific practice, allowing\nspecific research programs within an individual science to\nprogress. Althusser himself gives examples of three such major\ntransformations. The first is the founding of modern physics by\nGalileo, the other that of Greek mathematics, and the third, that of\nMarx’s founding of the science of Historical Materialism out of\nClassical Political Economy. Each of these foundings is marked by what\nAlthusser terms an “epistemological break,” or a period\nwhen ideological concepts are replaced by scientific ones. Any\nsimilarity here to Kuhnian ideas about revolutionary and normal\nscience is not surprising. Both Canguilhem and Bachelard, from whom\nAlthusser drew inspiration for his theory, were part of a dialogue\nthat took in the work of Alexander Koyré on scientific\nrevolutions, a thinker from whom Kuhn, in turn, drew his\ninspiration. \n\nAlthusser’s debt to the tradition of French historical\nepistemology in this account of knowledge production and philosophy of\nscience should now be evident. However, this epistemology’s\nMarxian and Spinozistic elements may be less pronounced. The vocabulary\nadopted above to express this theory, however, gestures to both\ninfluences. For Althusser, Marx’s founding of the science of\nhistory is crucial not only to politics (as will be addressed below)\nbut also to understanding all of human activity, including scientific\nactivity. That there is a circular logic to this epistemological\ntheory, Althusser readily admits, for it is only the science of\nHistorical Materialism that allows us to understand scientific practice\nin general. Althusser, though, is comfortable with this circularity.\nThis is because, insofar as this understanding of scientific practice\nin general allows us to understand how individual sciences produce\ntheir knowledge, Historical Materialism is a science that functions\nlike any other. \n\nFor Althusser, the concept that helps to produce this understanding\nof scientific practices is that of the “mode of\nproduction.” With it, he argues, Marx supplied theorists\nwith an idea sufficient to comprehend the way in which we materially\nproduce our selves, our environments, our knowledges, and our\nhistories. Indeed, this concept makes it possible to analyze all of our\nactivities in their specificity and to understand them in their\nrelation to the totality of which they are a part. As it must be if we\nare to make sense of scientific practice as one aspect of the total\nmode of production, much more than the activity of economic production\nmust be included in this totality of productive practices. Added by\nAlthusser to these two aspects of the mode of production are those of\nideological, political, and philosophical production, among others. \n\nIn each of the practices that together comprise, at any given time, a\nspecific mode of production, some form or forms of labor uses the existing means\nof production to transform existing materials into new products.\nAccording to Althusser, this realization is Marx’s basic insight.\nIn scientific production, for example, thinkers use existing theories\nto transform existing concepts into new, scientific concepts. However,\nand this is where Althusser’s Spinozism becomes apparent and also\nwhere he breaks with economistic understandings of Marx, it is not the\ncase that the analysis of any one mode of production within the\ntotality of productive practices is capable of generating an\nunderstanding of the way in which all rest of the productive processes\nare causally determined. Rather, and in line with the parallelism\nattributed by Leibniz to Spinoza, as each productive process transforms\na unique material (concepts in science, goods in economics, social\nrelations in politics), each process can only be understood in terms of\nits unique causal structure. In addition, and again also in a way\nsimilar to Spinoza’s account of substance as seen from different\naspects, each productive process is understood to stand in relation to\nand play a part of a complexly structured whole, none of which is\nreducible to being the simple or essential cause of the others. \n\nThat Althusser regards most, if not all, human activity as consisting\nof material processes of production and reproduction can be used as a\nkey to understanding other parts of his philosophy. These include his\nthoughts on the structure of the social and political world, the\nhistorical process, and philosophy. As philosophy is closely related to\nscience and because it is charged with a task that allows the\nproduction of knowledge about the other socio-economic practices to be\ngenerated, it is probably best to start with Althusser’s\nunderstanding of philosophy as a material practice of production before\nproceeding to a discussion of how Althusser understands the other\npractices listed above. \n\nAccording to Althusser, most activity labeled\n“philosophy” is really a type of ideological production. By\nthis, he means to say that most philosophy reproduces, in highly\nabstract form, notions about the world whose effect is to sustain\nexisting socio-economic relations. As such, philosophy merely reflects\nthe background values, attitudes, and ideas that allow the\nsocio-economic world to function. However, for Althusser, genuine\nphilosophy functions as a “Theory of theoretical practice”\n(1965b). In this mode, it works to provide an aid to scientific\npractice by distinguishing between ideological concepts and scientific\nones as well as by clarifying and rendering consistent the scientific\nconcepts that enable a science to transforms existing\nideas into scientific knowledge. \n\nFor Althusser, it is not necessary that this process of distinction\nand clarification be accomplished before a specific theoretical\npractice can generate scientific knowledge. In fact, scientific\nactivity often proceeds without a clear understanding of the concepts\nthat allow it to produce its knowledge. Indeed, Althusser maintained\nthat this was Marx’s lot when he was writing Capital:\nscientific knowledge of the capitalist economic system was being\nproduced, but Marx did not possess a full awareness of the concepts\nallowing this production. According to this definition of philosophy as\nthe Theory of theoretical practice, Althusser’s re-reading of\nCapital and other texts was philosophical insofar as it was\nable to name and distinguish the concepts that allowed Marx’s\nscientific analysis of history to proceed. \n\nThe latent concepts rendered explicit by the practice of symptomatic\nreading were said by Althusser to constitute the theory of Dialectical\nMaterialism, or what is the same thing, Marx’s philosophy. With\nthese concepts made explicit, Althusser believed that Marxist science,\nor Historical Materialism, could employ them in order to achieve better\nanalyses of specific modes of production and better understandings of\nthe opportunities that specific modes of production presented for\npolitical change. Some of these concepts have already been articulated\nin the discussion of the mode of production above, but without being\nnamed. To label these concepts and then to add some more, the idea that\neach individual productive process or element stands in relation to and\nplays a part of a complexly structured whole, none of which is\nreducible to being the simple or essential cause of the others, is what\nAlthusser terms the idea of “structural causality.”\nThis concept, in turn, is closely related to the idea of\n“overdetermination” or the theory that every element in the\ntotal productive process constituting a historical moment is determined\nby all the others. \n\nAnother Marxist philosophical concept that allows the historical\nmaterialist scientist to understand the logic of a specific mode of\nproduction is that of “contradiction.” This is the\nidea that, at any given period, multiple, concrete and definite\npractices take place within a mode of production. Among and within\nthese specific practices, there may or may not be tensions. \nTo take an example from Marx’s chapter on\n“Primitive Accumulation” in Capital V.I, at the\nsame time as peasants holdings were being expropriated in the late\n15th and early 16th centuries by a nascent\nbourgeoisie, the church and the aristocracy were passing laws against\nthis appropriation. Any isolable element of the total structure, be it\na person, a social class, an institution, or the state, in some way\nreflects and embodies these practices and these antagonisms and as such\neach is said to be “overdetermined.” Further,\nAlthusser specifies that the development of productive practices within\na specific mode of production is often “uneven” in addition\nto possibly being antagonistic. This means, for instance, that some\neconomic elements within a whole may be more or less capitalistic while\nothers simultaneously operate according to socialist norms. Thus the\ndevelopment within a mode of production of the practices specific to it\nis not necessarily homogenous or linear. \n\nAdded to the Marxian concepts of structural causality,\ncontradiction, uneven development, and overdetermination is that of the\n“structure in dominance.” This concept designates\nthat major element in a structural whole that tends to organize all of\nthe other practices. In much of the contemporary world and inasmuch as\nit tends to organize the production of moral values, scientific\nknowledge, the family, art, etc. this structure is the economic\npractice of commodity production and consumption. However, in another\nera and in other places, it may be the production and dissemination of\nreligious beliefs and practices that dominates and organizes the socio-economic\nstructure. \nWith this understanding of the elements that compose any\nsocio-economic structure and their relations made explicit, something\ncan now be said about the social and political philosophies that\nfollow from it. First, with the idea that human individuals are merely\none of the sites at which the contradictory productive forces that\ncharacterize an era are enacted, Althusser signals that the primary\nobject of social philosophy is not the human individual. Second, with\nthe idea that the state produced by political activity is merely one\nproductive process among others, Althusser signals that the primary\nelement in political philosophy is not the state. Though both states\nand individuals are important elements of the socio-economic whole,\nnothing philosophical is learned by examining the essence of the\nindividual or the way in which justice is embodied by the state. \n\nAs Althusser understands them, whatever conceptions we have of the\nnature of human beings or about the proper function of the state are\nhistorically generated and serve to reproduce existing social\nrelations. In other words, they are ideological. Apart from the\nnecessity of human beings to engage in productive relations with other\nhuman beings and with their environment in order to produce their means\nof subsistence, there is no human nature or essence. This is the core\nof Althusser’s “anti-humanist” position. Further,\nthough some order must exist in order to allow for the production and\nreproduction of social life, there is no essential or best form that\nthis order must take. This is not to say that human beings do not\nconceive of or strive for the best order for social life or that they\ndo not believe that they are essentially free or equal and deserving\nof rights. It also does not mean that all of our ideas are homogenous\nand that heterogeneous ideas about what is best cannot exist side by\nside in the same system without leading to conflict (though they\nsometimes do). However, the science of Historical Materialism has\nrevealed the desire for such orders to be historically generated along\nwith the ideas about human nature that justify them. \n\nThis account of the ideological role of our conceptions of human\nnature and of the best political arrangement shows Althusser to differ\nlittle from interpretations of Marx which hold that political\nideologies are the product of and serve existing economic relations.\nHowever, and as was detailed above, Althusser rejects the simple\nunderstanding of causality offered by this model in which economic\npractices order consciousness and our cultural practices. He also\nrejects the philosophy of history that often accompanies this model.\nThis philosophy has it that certain economic practices not only\ngenerate corresponding cultural practices, but that there is a pattern\nto economic development in which each economic order inexorably leads to\nits own demise and replacement by a different economic system. In this\nunderstanding of history, feudalism must lead to capitalism and\ncapitalism to socialism. Althusser, however, argues against the idea\nthat history has a subject (such as the economy or human agency)\nand that history has a goal (such as communism or human freedom).\nHistory, for Althusser, is a process without a subject. There are\npatterns and orders to historical life and there is historical change.\nHowever, there is no necessity to any of these transformations and\nhistory does not necessarily progress. Transformations do occur.\nHowever, they do so only when the contradictions and levels of\ndevelopment inherent in a mode of production allow for such change. \n\nFrom the time of its initial dissemination, Althusser’s\nre-reading of Marx was met by almost equal amounts of enthusiasm and\ncastigation. For every reader who found in his prose an explanation of\nMarx’s philosophy and science that rendered Marx philosophically\nrespectable and offered renewed hope for Marxist theory, there were\ncritics who judged his work to be idealist, Stalinist, dogmatist, or\nexcessively structuralist, among myriad other charges. Though many of\nthe initial reactions were contradictory and evidenced\nmisunderstandings of what Althusser was up to, compelling criticisms\nwere also offered. One was that Althusser was only able to offer his\nreading by ignoring much of what Marx actually wrote about his logic\nand about the concepts important to his analysis. Another criticism,\nand one voiced to Althusser by leaders of the French Communist Party,\nwas that Althusser’s reading of Marx offered little on the\nrelationship between Marxist theory and Marxist political practice. \n\nIt took a long time before Althusser explicitly addressed the charge\nthat he had ignored much of what Marx had to say about his own logic\nand concepts. However, buffeted by these criticisms and with a sense\nthat there were idealist or “theoreticist” tendencies in\nhis reading of Marx and that the relationship between theory and\npractice was indeed under-developed, Althusser set out during the late\n1960s and 1970s to correct and revise his take on the relationships\namong philosophy, science, ideology, and politics. To some readers,\nthese revisions represented a politically motivated betrayal of his\ntheoretical accomplishments. For others, they simply revealed his\nproject as a whole to be untenable and self-contradictory. Some recent\ncritics, however, have argued that these revisions are consistent with\nand necessary to the development of what they view to be the overall\ngoal of Althusser’s work: the development of a materialist\npolitical philosophy adequate for political practice. \n\nAlthusser’s initial revisions to his understanding of the social\nstructure and knowledge production were informed by a renewed\nattention to the works of Lenin and by a seminar he convened at the\nENS in 1967 for leading scientists and interested students. This\ncourse resulted in a series of papers, gathered together\nas Philosophy and the Spontaneous Philosophy of the\nScientists (1967a), in which Althusser began rethinking the\nrelations among philosophy, science, ideology, and politics. Though\nthis revision was later to be made more explicit, one of the most\nstriking aspects of these papers was Althusser’s abandonment of the\nSpinozistic claim that the different levels of theoretical practice\nwere autonomous. He now maintained that there was no criterion\nsufficient to demarcate scientific from ideological concepts and that\nall theoretical concepts are marked by ideology. This did not mean,\nhowever, that any concept was as good as any other.  Scientists,\nthrough their work on the material real, tended to generate better\nunderstandings of things than were available intuitively.  Further, he\nargued that philosophy still had a role to play in the clarification\nof scientific concepts. This is the case because, no matter how much\nwork scientists do to understand the material real and to generate\nbetter concepts, they must always employ ideological concepts to frame\ntheir investigations and its results. Marxist philosophers, he\nmaintained, could be useful to scientists by pointing out, from the\nstandpoint of politics and by the method of historical critique, where\nand how some of the concepts scientists employed were ideological. The\nresult of this intervention of philosophy into politics would not be\n“truer” concepts, but ideas that were more\n“correct” or “right” in both the normative and\npositive senses of these words. \n\nParallel to this move, and motivated by the need to provide the link\nbetween philosophical theory and political practice that was largely\nmissing from his classic work, Althusser now argued that philosophy had\na useful role to play between politics and science. Political practice,\nAlthusser maintained, was mostly motivated by ideological\nunderstandings of what the good is and how to accomplish it. Though he\ndid not argue that there was a way to leave ideology behind and to\nreveal the good in itself, he did maintain that science could help to\ncorrect ideological thinking about political means and ends. Social\nscience in particular could do so by showing how certain goals were\nimpossible or misguided given present socio-economic relations and by\nsuggesting that, at a certain time and in a certain place, other means\nand other ends might be more fruitfully adopted and pursued. As\nscientific knowledge does not speak directly to the public or to\npoliticians, Althusser assigned materialist philosophers the job of\ncommunicating scientific knowledge of the material real, its\nconditions, and its possibilities to politicians and the public. If\nthis communication is successful, Althusser maintained, one should not\nexpect all political activity to be successful. Instead, one should\nexpect a modest shift from an idealist ideology to one that is\nmaterialist and more scientific and which has a better chance of\nrealizing its goals. \n\nDuring the 1970s, Althusser continued the revisions begun in 1967 and\nelaborated other Marxian ideas he believed to be\nunderdeveloped. Perhaps the best known of the new conceptual\nformulations resulting from these efforts is that of\n“ideological interpellation.” This account of how a human\nbeing becomes a self-conscious subject was published in an essay\ntitled “Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses”\n(1970). It was excerpted from a larger essay essay titled “On\nthe Reproduction of Capitalism.” This work analyzed the\nnecessary relationship between state and subject such that a given\neconomic mode of production might subsist. It includes not only an\nanalysis of the state and its legal and educational systems but also\nof the psychological relationship which exists between subject and\nstate as ideology. This narrative of subjectification was intended to\nhelp advance Althusser’s argument that regimes or states are able to\nmaintain control by reproducing subjects who believe that their\nposition within the social structure is a natural one.  Ideology, or\nthe background ideas that we possess about the way in which the world\nmust function and of how we function within it is, in this account,\nunderstood to be always present. Specific socio-economic structures,\nhowever, require particular ideologies. These ideologies are\ninstantiated by institutions or “Ideological State\nApparatuses” like family, schools, church, etc., which provide\nthe developing subject with categories in which she can recognize\nherself. Inasmuch as a person does so and embraces the practices\nassociated with those institutions, she has been successfully\n“hailed” or “interpellated” and recognized\nherself as that subject who does those kinds of things. As the effect\nof these recognitions is to continue existing social relations,\nAlthusser argued that a Dictatorship of the Proletariat is necessary\nso that Ideological State Apparatuses productive of the bourgeois\nsubject can be replaced with those productive of proletarian or\ncommunist subjects. \n\nIn 1978 and as a response to what he saw, yet again, as the\ntheoretical and political misdirection of the Communist movement,\nAlthusser authored a piece, “Marx in his Limits,” which was\nintended to separate the good from the bad in Marx’s philosophy.\nIn his classic work, Althusser had tried to accomplish this goal by\nseparating out ideological concepts and by bringing forth the\nscientific ones. However, in “Marx in his Limits,” he now\nargued that such a method of separation cannot work\nbecause—within Marx’s writings and throughout his\noeuvre—both good and bad, materialist and idealist concepts, are\nhopelessly intermixed and many are underdeveloped. \n\nInasmuch as Althusser admits in this piece that Marx never fully\nabandoned Hegel’s logic, the concept of human alienation, or the\nidea that history has a goal, the inventory Althusser offers can be\nseen as a positive response to the charge that he had ignored\nMarx’s explicit statements in order to imagine for Marx a\nconsistent and “true” philosophy. Althusser does not give\nup on the task of articulating a better Marxist philosophy, however.\nInstead, he argues that there is another, “materialist”\ncriterion that allows us to see the limits of Marx’s thinking and\nto recognize those points in his work where Marx was\nunable to transcend his bourgeois background and his education in\nGerman Idealism. This criterion is that of the practical success or\nfailure of Marx’s concepts as each has been employed in the\nhistory of Marxist movements. When we have affected this inventory and\ngrouped together the successful concepts, what we are left with is a\nmaterialist Marxism, a Marxism which endorses the scientific method as\nthe best way for understanding ourselves and our potential but that\nalso understands that this method is fallible. Remaining also is a\nMarxism which does not subscribe to any philosophy of history and which\ncertainly does not maintain that capitalism will inevitably lead to\ncommunism. This Marxism has no system of interrelated concepts that\nguarantee a scientific analysis. Further, it possesses no worked out\ntheory of the relations between economic structures and cultural\nstructures but for that limited knowledge which scientific practice\nprovides. Finally, this Marxism has given up the dream of analyzing the\nwhole of culture and its movement from the outside; it realizes that\none thinks inside and about the culture one inhabits in order to\npossibly effect and change that culture. \n\nAfter being interrupted by ill health and by the events following\nfrom the murder of his wife, in 1982 Althusser returned to the question\nof what was essential to Marx’s philosophy and expanded the scope\nof this inquiry to include speculation about the metaphysics that must\nunderlie it. Freed by his ignoble status from the\ntask of influencing the direction of the Communist movement, the texts\nassociated with this project and gathered together in the book\nPhilosophy of the Encounter differ tremendously in subject\nmatter, style, and method from his other writings. Whether these texts\nrepresent a continuation of, or even the key to his philosophy or\nwhether they are an aberration is presently being debated in the\nsecondary literature. However, as there is strong textural and archival\nevidence that many of the ideas explicitly expressed in these works had\nbeen gestating for a long time, the contention that these writings are\nof a piece with his earlier work seems to be gaining ground. \n\nThe principal thesis of Althusser’s last philosophical\nwritings is that there exists an “underground” or little\nrecognized tradition in the history of philosophy. Variously labeled a\n“materialism of the encounter” or “aleatory\nmaterialism,” the method which he uses to articulate this\nphilosophy is to simply comment upon works by philosophers who\nexemplify this current and to point out where, how, and to what extent\nthey do so. In addition to Marx, the philosophers that he cites as\nbeing part of this underground tradition include Democritus, Epicurus,\nLucretius, Machiavelli, Spinoza, Hobbes, Rousseau, Montesquieu,\nHeidegger, and Wittgenstein. From these readings in the history of\nphilosophy, Althusser aims to suggest that this tradition exists and\nthat it is both philosophically fecund and viable. He also wishes to\nreturn to and bolster the thesis he first ventured in the late 1960s\nthat there are really only two positions in philosophy: materialism and\nidealism. As he understood it, the two tendencies are always in a war\nof opposition with the one functioning to reinforce the status quo and\nthe other to possibly overcome it. \n\nPerhaps because it functions in opposition to the idealist tendency\nin philosophy, aleatory materialism is marked almost as much by its\nrejections as it is by the positive claims it contains about the world\nand about history. As Marx is included within this tradition, it is not\nsurprising that many of these rejections are also attributed to him\nduring the course of Althusser’s earlier work. These include a\ndismissal of what Althusser calls “the principle of\nReason,” or the idea that the universe or history has an origin\nor an end. With this prohibition, Althusser means to exclude from this\ntradition not only the usual suspects in the rationalist tradition, but\nalso mechanical and dialectical materialisms with their logics of\ndetermination. Also dismissed, he maintains, is the myth that somehow\nphilosophy and philosophers are autonomous, that they see the world\nfrom outside and objectively. Though there is an objective world,\nphilosophy does not have knowledge of this world as its object for\nthere is no way for it to ground itself and the material it thinks with\nand through arises historically. Philosophy is therefore not a science\nor the Science of sciences and it produces no universal Truth. Rather,\nthe truths it produces are contingent and are offered in opposition to\nother competing truths. If philosophy does have an object, it is the\nvoid, or that which is not yet but which could be. \n\nThat the philosophy of the encounter lacks an object does not mean\nthat it lacks positive propositions. However, given the\nepistemological status attributed to philosophy by Althusser, these\nmetaphysical propositions or “theses” are true only insofar\nas they have explanatory or practical value. First among them,\nfollowing Democritus, is the thesis that matter is all that exists.\nSecond is the thesis that chance or the aleatory is at the origin of\nall worlds. That the patterns which constitute and define these worlds\ncan be known, described, and predicted according to certain laws or\nreasons is also true. However, the fact that these worlds ever came to\nbe organized in these patterns is aleatory and the patterns themselves can only\never be known immanently. Third, new worlds and new orders themselves\narise out of chance encounters between pre-existing material elements.\nWhether or not such orders emerge is contingent: they do not have to\noccur. When material elements collide, they either “take”\nand a new order is founded, or they do not and the old world\ncontinues. \n\nTo Althusser, the propositions which have explanatory value at the\nlevel of ontology and cosmology also have value at the level of\npolitical philosophy. After first citing Rousseau and Hobbes as\nexample of philosophers who recognized that the origin and continued\nexistence of political orders is contingent, Althusser turns to\nMachiavelli and Marx for his principle examples of how aleatory\nmaterialism functions in the political realm. The anti-teleological,\nscientistic, and anti-humanist, Marxist philosophy developed by\nAlthusser over the course of his career works well with the\nmaterialist metaphysics recounted above. In this understanding of\nMarxist philosophy, societies and subjects are seen as patterns of\nactivity that behave in predictable ways. Though scientists may study\nand describe these orders in their specificity, it does not at first\nappear that philosophy can do much except to categorize these\ninteractions at the most general level. However, citing Marx’s\nwork again and taking inspiration from Machiavelli’s project of\ninstalling “a new prince in a new principality,” Althusser\nargues that the materialist philosopher may accomplish somewhat more\nthan this with her descriptions, critiques, and predictions. This is\nbecause, by examining a political order not from the perspective of\nits necessity but with an awareness of its contingency, this\nphilosopher may be able think the possibility of its\ntransformation. If chance smiles on her, if someone listens and if\neffects occur, then elements might recombine and a new political might\ntake hold. This is, to be sure, a very limited and unpredictable power\nattributed to the philosopher. However, it is also the only one that\nAlthusser in his late works argues is adequate for political practice\nand that does not, like idealism, merely serve to reproduce existing\nrelations.","contact.mail":"wlewis@skidmore.edu","contact.domain":"skidmore.edu"}]
