Among the mendicant\norders that had settled in the cities were the Dominicans (ordo\nfratrum praedicatorum), dedicated to promoting in their teaching,\nway of life, and preaching the ideal of man’s\nself-discovery—self-cultivation—as a singular cultural\nvalue. The dynamics of this self-discovery can be said to be two-fold.\nFor, on one hand, man discovers himself by liberating himself from\nhimself and therewith finding—in himself—what transcends\nhim. On the other hand, what man finds in himself displays its own\nmovement as all that remains when his self-discovery has reached its\nend. In this developmental context, Meister Eckhart directed his\ntheoretical analysis towards elucidating the self-movement of\nintellect as such, in its differentiation, as a movement representing\nin practical terms the only possible form of life. Indeed, in this era\nof radical social upheaval, Eckhart put forward the dynamics of\nintellect (reason, rationality) as the genuine wealth possessed by\nthose who are poor in spirit. His philosophical formulations and\ntheological statements served, in their reciprocal convergence, to\nunfold in theoretical terms the dynamics of intellect with a view to\nrecommending the practice of processive reason as the exemplary form\nof life.  Eckhart explained these dynamics mostly on the basis of\ntexts from the Holy Scriptures, whose philosophical content he set out\nthrough philosophical arguments—something he was able to do\nbecause he regarded the Holy Scriptures as a work of philosophy\n(cf. Echardus, In Ioh. n. 444; LW III, 380, 12–14:\n“evangelium contemplatur ens in quantum ens”:\n“the Gospel treats of being insofar as it is\nbeing”—Aristotle, as was well known, having defined the\nobject of metaphysics in precisely this manner). Yet Eckhart’s\nexplanations of these dynamics were also based on philosophical theses\nclosely linked to notions from the Holy Scriptures. In both cases, he\nclaimed to give unreserved expression to the new and rare (nova et\nrara) in propagating what was for him the only possible form of\nlife: that of processive reason or of processes directed by reason. In\nso doing, Meister Eckhart dedicated his life to philosophy: as a\nphilosopher holding a chair of theology at the University of Paris, as\na philosopher leading the Dominican Order, and as a philosopher\noccupying the preacher’s pulpit.\n\n\n\nEckhart was born in 1260 in Hochheim (Thuringia). He entered the\nDominican Order quite early, and received most of his education in the\nStudium Generale in Cologne that Albert the Great had founded\nin 1248. In 1286 Eckhart went to Paris to study. From 1294 until 1298,\nhe was Prior of the Convent of Erfurt, at the same time carrying out\nthe office of Vicar of Thuringia. Eckhart was promoted to Master of\nTheology at Paris in 1302 and taught as Professor there in the\nacademic year 1302/1303. He was elected Provincial of the newly\nfounded Province of Saxony in 1303, and held this office until\n1311. In 1307 Eckhart also took over the administration of the\nProvince of Bohemia as Vicar General. When the Provincial Chapter of\nthe Province of Teutonia elected him Provincial in 1310, the election\nwas not accepted by the General Chapter in Naples (1311). Instead,\nEckhart was sent once more to Paris. After teaching there for a second\nperiod, Eckhart went to Strasbourg in 1313, where from 1314 to 1322 he\nwas increasingly active as a preacher caring for Dominican convents\nthere. From 1323 on, Eckhart resided in Cologne, most likely at the\nStudium Generale, and probably as Lecturer. During this time,\nthe campaigns against him began that led, in 1326, to the opening of\nan inquisitional proceeding. In its course Eckhart submitted a reply\nto the syllabus of errors attributed to him, protesting as well\nagainst the proceeding itself, which was then continued at the Papal\nCourt in Avignon. It resulted in the papal bull In agro\ndominico from Pope John XXII, issued on March 27, 1329,\ncondemning 17 articles from this syllabus as heretical and 11 more as\nsuspect of heresy. Eckhart, however, did not live to see his\ncondemnation; he died sometime before April 30, 1328—probably on\nJanuary 28, 1328, possibly in Avignon. \n\nAt the beginning of the academic year 1293/94 Eckhart held an\ninaugural lecture (Collatio in libros Sententiarum) that has\nbeen preserved. An academic sermon, the Sermo Paschalis a. 1294\nParisius habitus and the Tractatus super oratione\ndominica date from the same time. Between 1294 and 1298 Eckhart\ncomposed his Instructional Talks (Die rede der\nunderscheidunge), table-talks for his confratres in the\nErfurt monastery. From his first teaching period in Paris (1302/03)\ncome the Quaestiones (Quaestio Parisiensis I,\nII and the rationes Equardi from one of the disputed\nquestions of Gonsalvus Hispanus), as well as the Sermo die beati\nAugustini Parisius habitus, a feast-day sermon in honor of\nAugustine (August 18, 1302 or February 28, 1303), and perhaps two\nother Quaestiones. Between 1303 and 1310, during a General\nChapter, Eckhart held the Sermones on Ecclesiastics 24:\n23–27a and 24: 27b–31. In 1305 he began composing the\nOpus tripartitum, his major work, comprising three parts: the\nOpus propositionum (Work of Theses), with over 1,000\ntheses in 14 treatises, the Opus quaestionum (Work of\nProblems) and the Opus expositionum (Work of\nInterpretations).  Much of the Opus tripartitum remained\nincomplete. What we have are the Prologus generalis in opus\ntripartitum, the Prologus in opus propositionum, the\nPrologus in opus expositionum I and II, and\nvarious commentaries (above all the Expositio sancti evangelii\nsecundum Iohannem).  Also preserved is an Opus sermonum\ncontaining drafts of Latin sermons. From the Strasbourg and Cologne\nperiod come the treatise Daz buoch der goetlîchen\ntroestunge and the sermon Von dem edeln menschen. (The\nauthenticity of the treatise Von abegescheidenheit has been\ndisputed in the past, but it has been recently accepted once more as a\nwork of Eckhart.) The most important German sermons also go back to\nthis last period. Among these is Predigt 52, which due to its\nextremely innovative content was later translated from Middle High\nGerman into Latin. \n\nOf all those following in the tradition of Albert the Great who\ndeveloped theories of the intellect in the 13th and 14th centuries,\nDietrich of Freiberg went the furthest. In treating of the active\nintellect (intellectus agens), Dietrich identified a\nthree-fold object, which, however, the intellect knows in a single\nintuition (uno intuitu): its principle (deus), its\nessence (essentia) and the totality of beings\n(universitas entium). According to Dietrich, the intellect\nknows its essence and all beings not only according to its essence,\nbut also “in its principle, according to the mode of this very\nprinciple” (in suo principio secundum modum ipsius\nprincipii; cf.  Dietrich of Freiberg, De intellectu et\nintelligibili II 37–40, ed. Mojsisch, 1977,\npp. 175–77). This mode of knowing is the highest that we can\nidentify. Before Dietrich, no one had formulated this mode of knowing\nin such a progressive manner by making such a radical claim.\nNevertheless, Dietrich did not further elaborate how to think\nthis mode of knowing in its individual moments, that is, the way the\nintellect actually knows “in its principle, according to the\nmode of this very principle”. \n\nMeister Eckhart begins where Dietrich of Freiberg leaves off.  Nowhere\nin his writings does Eckhart mention Dietrich by name, although they\nwere personally acquainted, and although Dietrich used his influence\nto see that Eckhart received significant posts within the Dominican\nOrder. Yet Eckhart goes a step beyond Dietrich by expanding upon what\nDietrich had given only general expression to, unfolding how the\nintellect actually moves in itself and therewith demonstrating what it\nmeans for the intellect to know “according to the mode of this\nvery principle”. Briefly put, understanding how the intellect\nreturns to its principle, where it might know “according to the\nmode of its principle”, requires that we first identify the way\nin which this principle itself knows, so that we might then grasp how\nthe intellect comes to know there. \n\nIn the initial stage of his career, Meister Eckhart composed some not\nvery exciting table-talks for his confratres and, in his lost\nCommentary on the Sentences (Goris/Pikavé, 2001), most\nlikely advocated doctrines based on the theology of Thomas\nAquinas. Once back in Paris, however, Eckhart inaugurated his teaching\nwith a bombshell. With a new thesis directed against Thomas Aquinas,\nas well as against his own Thomistic thinking prior to 1302, Eckhart\ncontends that the absolute principle (or the absolute cause: God) is\npure intellect and not being. According to this view, being\n(esse) is always caused and thus presupposes intellect,\nitself without being, as the cause of being. In line with Neoplatonic\nmodes of thinking (cf. Liber de causis, cap. XI;\nFidora/Niederberger, 2001, 76: “Causatum ergo in causa est\nper modum causae …”: “What is caused is in the\ncause in the mode of the cause …”), Eckhart holds that\nbeing is, in intellect, nothing other than intellect and, therefore,\nnot simply being, but instead being that has been elevated to\nintellect. If someone should nonetheless object that in God knowing or\nanything else might be described as ‘being’, the proper\nresponse for Eckhart is that this ‘being’ still\npresupposes the knowing of intellect (“Et si tu intelligere\nvelis vocare esse, placet mihi.  Dico nihilominus, quod, si in deo est\naliquid, quod velis vocare esse, sibi competit per\nintelligere”: “And if you wish to call intelligizing\nbeing, that is all right with me. Nonetheless, I say that if there is\nsomething in God that you wish to call being, it suits him through\nintelligizing”; cf. Echardus de Hochheim, Utrum in deo sit\nidem esse et intelligere n. 24, ed. Mojsisch, 1999, 192,\n103–105). As the absolute cause, intellect is thought of as\nabsolutely unlimited only if it is thought of as wholly without being.\nAs such, intellect becomes the principle for absolute as well as\ncontingent being. The alternative view—that knowing is simply\nidentical with being (a position advanced by Sturlese, 1993a and von\nPerger, 1997 and again, with new argumentation, by Grotz,\n2002)—disregards the more sweeping contention in Eckhart’s\nthesis that knowing is presupposed in every case of being.\n(Later, Nicholas of Cusa maintains accordingly that the maximum is\nwithout being, yet can be contracted to being; cf. Nicholas of Cusa,\nDe docta ignorantia I, 6, ed. Hoffmann/Klibansky, 1932a,\np. 14, 1: “Praeterea, contrahamus maximum ad esse et\ndicamus …”: “Besides, we might contract the\nmaximum to being and say …”) Scholars such as Klibansky,\nhowever, as well as Imbach, 1976 have drawn attention to parallel\npassages in the German sermons that make it clear that for Eckhart\nabsolute knowing is without being, indeed, that intellection is prior\nto being. \n\nBetween the uncreated and the created the predominant relationship is\none of analogy, a relationship involving as well the\ndisjunction of the two terms. Insofar as Eckhart in 1305 again takes\nup the theme of absolute being in its identity with God (esse est\ndeus), he likewise gives expression to relationships of\nanalogical causality, teaching that being as such, or absolute being\n(esse absolute), is what becomes restricted to determinate\nbeing (esse hoc et hoc), while determinate being is what\nbrings it about that a this or a that (hoc et hoc) actually\nexists.  Eckhart says ever again that the created is of itself pure\nnothing, indeed, even nothingness or nullity (nihileitas,\nnulleitas). The created is only because absolute\nbeing communicates itself to it—through determinate\nbeing—whereby determinate being, of course, is not in any\nposition to communicate being as such, but only determinacy.\nThat all of this is so, of course, is something that can be\neasily stated. Indeed, the metaphysics of being has always thrived on\ndescribing such structures, whether this being be absolute or\ndeterminate in nature. \n\nEckhart, however, breaks through that metaphysics of being with its\nanalogical base by thinking through the relation of causality\ninforming absolute being. We can assume at least hypothetically that a\ncause causes not only something dependent on it, but also something\nequal to it, namely that the cause causes in such a manner that it\ncauses itself. But if it causes itself, it causes\nsomething which is itself also cause and at the same time cause of its\ncause.  Such a mode of causality is called ‘univocal\ncausality’.  Our hypothesis of what could be thought in these\nterms turns into a certainty when we explore the structures of\nintellectual causality, for example, the relation between the act of\nthinking and what is thought, or between an ethical principle and an\nethical principiate. Their relation is precisely what Eckhart takes\nadvantage of in developing his theory of univocal causality. In these\ncases, it holds that the principle causes its principiate, and the\nprincipiate causes its principle. Even more: The principiate is in its\nprinciple nothing other than its principle. This means that the active\n(principle) is at the same time active and passive, being affected in\nthe course of its activity (as principle). In turn, the passive\n(principiate) is at the same time passive  and active, being\nactive in the course of its passivity (as principiate). Accordingly, a\ncentral proposition of Eckhart reads as follows:\n“[Principium et principiatum] … opponuntur\nrelative: in quantum opponuntur, distinguuntur, sed in quantum\nrelative, mutuo se ponunt …” (Echardus, In\nIoh. n. 197; LW III, 166, 10–12: “[The principle and the\nprincipiate] … are opposed to one another relatively:\nInsofar as they are opposed, they are distinguished, but insofar as\nthey are relative, they reciprocally posit themselves\n…”). \n\nThe breakthrough that Eckhart attains through his theory of univocal\ncausality is exemplified by the relation between thinking and thought.\nFor Eckhart, thinking presupposes no origin because a presupposed\norigin could only be thought by thinking and hence would be a thought\nof thinking, that is, itself thinking. Thinking is, then, for itself a\npresuppositionless origin, that is, it is its own principle:\nprincipium (Echardus, In Ioh. n. 38; LW III, 32, 11:\n“… ipsum principium semper est intellectus purus\n…”: “The principle itself is always pure\nintellect …”). Any thinking without act, however, is no\nthinking at all. Consequently, its own originative activity accrues to\nthinking, that is, insofar as it is a principle, the dynamics of its\nprincipiating: principiare.  In this activity, however,\nthinking directs itself towards a thought that it has originated, that\nis, towards the product that is its principiate:\nprincipiatum. But since this thought is a thought of\nthinking, it is itself nothing other than thinking. The act of this\nthinking that has been thought is, then, retrograde. This thought, as\nthinking, is in turn principle, principiating and principiate, whereby\nthis last is the original thinking. In this way, thinking thinks\nitself as thought and is therewith active thinking, while thought,\ninsofar as it thinks its thinking, is itself thinking, and its\nthinking now thought. Consequently, both thinking and thought are at\nthe same time active and passive. \n\nAnother example of univocal causality as conceived by Eckhart is found\nin the relation between justice and the just man. In the same vein as\nthat sketched out with regard to the dynamics of thinking, justice is\nin the just man, and the just man is in justice. The just man is his\njust action, and this just action is likewise justice.  Between the\njust man and justice, there is difference on account of the opposition\nbetween them, but because of their relationality they reciprocally\ninclude each other. Just as thought is the thought of thinking and\ntherewith itself thinking, so, too, is what is just for Eckhart what\nis just of justice and therewith justice itself. From this we can\ndraw, following Eckhart, a number of important conclusions. \n\nA. For the just man, there is no why to his just action, no\npurpose or goal of this action. For the action of the just man has\njustice as its goal, and this goal is identical with the just man.\nTherefore, the just man has no goal external to himself. Instead, as\njustice, he is his own goal. \n\nB. With the just man and with justice, there is no multiplicity.\nJustice is one, and the just man is one; thus, justice and the just\nman are one. Even if there are many just men: As\njust men, the many just men are one (Echardus, In Sap. n. 44;\nLW II, 366, 6–7: “… omnes iusti, in quantum iusti,\nunum sunt …”), indeed, they are even justice itself. \n\nC. Justice, which is the just man, knows neither where nor\nwhen, that is, it knows neither space nor time, neither size\nnor quality, neither inside nor outside, neither over nor under,\nneither this side nor that side, neither above nor below, neither the\nactivity of effecting nor the passivity of being effected. Hence,\njustice is indeterminate and does not accrue to anything else as an\naccident. Justice is something whose purpose lies in itself. \n\nD. Consequently, the just man is in justice, which means: The just man\nis justice. This implies a reversal of the usual way of\nlooking at things. Normally, a quality (qualitas) is what is\nfound in an underlying subject (subiectum). With the\nspiritual perfections (perfectiones spirituales), however,\nthe situation is different: The subjects are in the perfections, the\njust man is in justice. But in the realm of the spirit, being-in is\nnothing other than being-one. Hence, the just man, who is in justice,\nis justice itself.  The just man does not possess justice,\nbut rather is justice. Similarly, he who is free is freedom\nitself (Echardus, Predigt 28; DW II, 62, 3–5;\ncf. Predigt 10; DW I, 165, 2: “… und ich diu\nwîsheit selber bin, sô bin ich ein wîser\nmensche”; what applies in the cases of freedom and justice\nalso applies in the case of wisdom). If he who is free merely\npossessed freedom, then this freedom would be something external to\nhim, and he would never be freedom itself. \n\nWhat is key is that by freedom Eckhart understands nothing\nother than self-consciousness or the I. It is never\nthe case that the I wants something other, rather it wants only\nitself; the I never knows something other, rather it knows only\nitself; the I is never open for anything other, rather it is open for\nitself alone.  Thus, the I is both cause of itself and conceives\nitself alone in itself. The itself known and wanted by the I,\nas well as defining its fundamental openness, is the other\nI—that is, the moment of self-relationality constitutive\nfor the realm of the spirit. \n\nE. In summary, Eckhart can say: “… in spiritualibus\nconceptio est ipsa parturitio sive partus” (Echardus, In\nExod. n.  207; LW II, 174, 3–4): In the realm of the spirit,\nconceiving is bearing or giving birth—and therefore (passive)\nsuffering is (active) production. It should be noted that the motif of\nbirth is one of Eckhart’s favorites, for example, when he holds\nthat the divine Father bears his Son in the soul, more precisely: in\nthe ground of the soul, and in this way he bears me as himself and\nhimself as me.  This motif, however, is not limited to theological\ncontexts. It also finds application as a philosophical motif. Here,\nagain, it is necessary to become accustomed to Eckhart’s\nusage. Where others speak of “causing” or\n“principiating”, Eckhart speaks of\n“bearing”. This kind of language must be approached\ncarefully, however, and demands close scrutiny now more than\never. Such a hermeneutical approach is currently favored especially by\nLargier, Hasebrink and Köbele. \n\nF. “Swer underscheit verstât von gerehticheit und von\ngerehtem, der verstât allez, daz ich sage” (Echardus,\nPredigt 6; DW I, 105, 2–3): “Whoever understands\nthe theory of justice and the just man understands everything that I\nam saying.” With this statement, Eckhart commends to our\nattention the paradigm of univocal co-relationality in the just man\nand justice.  On one hand, this paradigm composes the precondition for\nthat analogical thinking that informs, among other things, the\nrelation of the uncreated and the created. While Wilde, 2000 asserts,\nthen, that univocal causality is subsumed in analogical causality,\nEckhart’s theory is exactly the opposite. On the other hand,\nhowever, the paradigm of univocal causality refers to what, in line\nwith Eckhart, must still be made thematic because, as what is first,\nit cannot be put into question: the one as unity. \n\nThe goal of the rational form of life—of living in and with the\nspiritual perfections at the level of that transcendental being or\nbeing (esse, ens) convertible with the termini\ntranscendentes (the one, the true, and the good)—is living\nin and from the absolute one (in and from the divine nature as\npresuppositionless unity). If the ground of the soul, as something\nuncreated and uncreatable—attributes which Meister\nEckhart’s contemporary Eckhart von Gründig\nexplicitly ascribes to the ground or ‘little\nspark’ of the soul that Meister Eckhart often invokes (cf.\nWinkler, 1999), thus indicating that he in fact employed these\nattributes—if human reason—not as human, but as\nreason—is one with the divine nature or ground (Echardus,\nPredigt 5b; DW I, 90, 8: “Hie ist gotes grunt\nmîn grunt und mîn grunt gotes grunt”:\n“Here, God’s ground is my ground and my ground God’s\nground”), then man is no longer simply on the way towards unity\n(unio). Instead, unity is something that has always already\nbeen achieved. This being-unified is alone what matters (Echardus,\nPredigt 12; DW I, 197, 8–9; Predigt\n39; DW II, 265, 6–266, 2), because man as reason\nhas left behind everything that stands in the way of his living in and\nfrom unity, and because the ground of the soul is more interior in\nthis unity than it is in itself (Mojsisch 1983a, 140–141; 2001,\n163–165). This is true equanimity—letting-go\n(Gelâzenheit)—as the goal of human life. \n\nLiving in and from unity in the manner envisioned by Eckhart as the\nend of self-discovery becomes possible through a change\n(metabole) in intellectual disposition. The possible\nintellect—which, as defined by Aristotle, can become all things\n(cf. De anima III 5, 430a14–15)—is\nable to know either as ordinary consciousness (in images,\nspecies of things) or as self-consciousness through\nself-knowledge (without images, free from images). The conversion in\ndisposition—Plato speaks of a peristrophe of the\nsoul (cf. Res publica VII, 521c5)—leads the possible\nintellect to the uncreated and uncreatable ground of the soul, whose\nmovement, as a process of reason, reaches its goal in the absolute one\n(unialiter unum, a combination suggested by Proclus; Eckhart\nspeaks of the luter pur clar Ein or indistinctum,\nthe undifferentiated). This goal, however, is itself nothing other\nthan the ground of the soul. The ground of the soul in the absolute\none is its own goal because self-consciousness is nothing other than\none and the one, because freedom is nothing other than one and the\none, because moral responsibility for oneself and others—Eckhart\nspeaks of justice—is nothing other than one and the\none.  Self-consciousness, freedom and justice are always and\neverywhere only themselves, having nothing ‘outside’ of,\nadditional or foreign to them. \n\nFor Eckhart, this means that whoever is justice is always justice,\nbecause the I that would stand out from justice would no longer be an\nI. The I always already knows that it is justice, however, because in\nknowing itself as just, it knows itself as justice; for the just man\nis justice. The I knows that it is just, however, because otherwise it\ndoes not know at all and is not even an I at all. The I is what it is\nonly as rationality, as a knowing which knows that it is and\nknows what it is. This I is not only cause of itself\n(causa sui; Eckhart, deepening the tradition of this concept,\nsays sache mîn selbes: “cause of myself”;\ncf. Summerell, 2002). It is moreover the cause for God, insofar as God\nstands in relation to his creatures. For only the uncreated and\nuncreateable ground of the soul stands not in relation to creatures,\nbut instead only in relation to itself (cf. Echardus, Predigt\n52). The I that knows itself, wills itself, and is its own abode,\nand therewith the I that is, in univocal causality, cause of itself\nand yet, in this unity, the one rationality, is, according to Eckhart,\nwhat man ought to become and what man can become in taking on the true\npoverty of spirit. This is so since man has always been this I, is now\nthis I, and always will be this I, even if he knows nothing of himself\nas this I. \n\nConsequently, the movement of reason, as Eckhart presents it, takes\nits point of departure from absolute unity and, as a principle, takes\non being. This principle knows itself and wills itself, thinking\nthought in this way as its principiate, the ground of the soul in its\nuncreatedness and uncreatability. Since this thought is a thought of\nthinking, however, and thus itself thinking, this thinking that has\nbeen thought principiates its own principle in retrograde fashion. (As\nEckhart puts it, the Son is reborn in the Father.) This movement of\nreason, as one of self-discovery and self-cultivation, ends there,\nwhere it began, in presuppositionless unity, where it might begin\nanew.  This is the fundamental process—taking place in and from\nunity—inherent to the self-knowing and self-willing I. Insofar\nas it knows itself and wills itself, this I is nothing other than what\nman is when he has transcended himself as a creature fraught with\nnothingness and entrusted himself to the movement of the ground of the\nsoul, acknowledging this movement as the sole form of life: that of\nself-consciousness, freedom, and moral responsibility.  \n\nNicholas of Cusa, when asked what he had to say about Eckhart,\nremarked that he had never read in Eckhart that the creature was\nidentical with the creator. At the same time, he praised\nEckhart’s talent (ingenium) as well as his ardor\n(studium). Yet Nicholas also suggested that Eckhart’s\nbooks should be removed from the public sphere, since they contained\nmuch that was astute and useful (subtilita et utilia) for\nthose who understood them, but the people were not ready for what, in\nEckhart, contradicted the traditional doctrines of the learned\nworld. \n Still, the teacher said that he had never read that he [Eckhart]\nthought that the creature was the creator, and praised his [Eckhart's]\ntalent and ardor. Yet he wished that his [Eckhart's] books would be\nremoved from public places; for the people are not ready for what he\n[Eckhart] often intersperses, contrary to the custom of other learned\nmen, even though the intelligent find in them many astute and useful\nthings.\n  \n What Nicholas gave voice to is not simply the divide between medieval\nand modern thought, as well as that between orthodoxy and\nunconventionality, that he himself most remarkably straddled. In fact,\nit remains a challenge even today to properly understand the\nEckhartian thought that man is free only if he (not merely\npossesses but instead) is freedom. This is so, in\npart, because even scholarly language runs up against its limits in\nEckhart. For we still cannot give adequate expression to the real\nmeaning of the statement: “The free man is, if he is really\nfree, freedom itself, yet only insofar as he is free.” For this\nvery reason, however, it is all the more necessary to engage ourselves\nin Eckhart’s thinking instead of banning his writings from the\npublic sphere. For if our thought counsels it, our language must\nchange, indeed, not only the language of scholars, but that of the\npeople as well."}]
