Defending Plato’s reputation from\nthe attacks of the arch-Aristotelian George of Trebizond—attacks\nwhich were founded in a long anti-Platonic tradition—Bessarion\nintroduced Christianized readings of Plato’s dialogues,\ncharacterizing him as the pagan philosopher best suited to Roman\ntheology. Bessarion’s argumentative strategy not only rescued\nPlato, but also opened the path to an anti-metaphysical approach to\nAristotelianism, while revealing to the Latin world a wealth of\nknowledge from his Greek cultural heritage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBessarion was born in Trebizond between 1399 and 1408, and baptized\nBasil. At a young age, he went to Byzantium, where he studied with John\nCortasmenos (d. 1431/7). He changed his name to Bessarion when he\nbecame a monk in 1423. Pursuing his ecclesiastical\ncareer, Bessarion engaged in diplomatic activity in the service\nof the emperor John VIII Palaiologos. This put him in contact with the\ncourt of the Despot of Mistra, a city where he had the opportunity to\ndeepen his philosophical and mathematical training under the guidance\nof Gemistos Pletho (d. 1454). The decisive year in the life of\nBessarion was probably 1437, when he was made metropolitan of Nicea\n(hence the common epithet of Cardinal Nicenus) and left for\nItaly as member of the Greek delegation to the Council of\nFerrara-Florence. The Council was mainly devoted to an attempt at\nunifying the Latin and Greek Churches, which the Western European\npowers had made a condition for providing military support to\nPalaiologos as he attempted to fend off the Ottoman Turks. As a member\nof the Greek delegation, the young Bessarion was not eager to concede\nthe main dogmatic point of disagreement between the two churches,\nwhich had led to their separation in the eleventh century: the problem\nof the place of the Holy Spirit in the Creed. According to the\nGreeks the Spirit proceeded only from the Father, while in the Roman formulation\nit also proceeded from the Son (Filioque). And yet, driven by\nhis concern for the unstable political situation in Greece and finally\nconvinced by the texts of the Church Fathers, Bessarion changed his\nmind and in April 1439 pronounced an oration (the Oratio dogmatica\nde unione), in which he advocated for agreement between Greek\nand Latin authors. In July 1439 Bessarion read the act of union\nbetween the Roman and the Greek Church in Florence. The same year,\nwhile he was in Greece for the last time, Bessarion was made Cardinal. \nBessarion would spend the rest of his life as one of the most\nimportant and influential members of the Roman Curia. He was selected\nfor important diplomatic missions; for example, in 1450 Niccolò\nV sent him to Bologna as legato a latere. He took particular\ncare of Greek rites abbeys, like those in Calabria, Messina, and\nGrottaferrata. He obtained a number of benefices, and in 1458 he was\nselected as protector of the Franciscan Order. In 1463 he also became\nPatriarch of Constantinople. He even came close to being elevated to\nthe papacy at least twice, but apparently his beard—which for\nmany symbolized his Greek origins—prevented him from garnering\nthe necessary support. His activities as a cardinal were coupled with\nscholarly enterprises, which he undertook personally, and also sponsored\nas the patron of a circle of intellectuals who were\nin many cases Greek emigrés like him. Men like Theodore Gaza\n(d. 1476) and Niccolò Perotti (d. 1480)—and for a short period even his nemesis-to-be George of Trebizond (d. 1473)—were\nall part of the Cardinal’s entourage.  \nAfter the fall of \nConstantinople in 1453, Bessarion’s main interest was in\nrescuing the cultural heritage of his homeland, Greece, and he pursued\nthis goal on both intellectual and political planes. From an\nintellectual point of view, Bessarion’s plan involved salvaging\nGreek texts which were until then unknown in Western Christendom and\nwere generally rare (to the extent that in some cases they survive\ntoday only in the exemplars collected by the Cardinal). An avid\nlifelong book collector, Bessarion assembled a library in order to\nprevent the loss of these treasures: “without books, the tomb\nwould cover the names of men, just as it covers their bodies”.\nBessarion feared—indeed he was consumed with\nterror—“lest all those wonderful books, the product of so\nmuch toil and study by the greatest human minds, those very beacons of\nthe earth, should be brought to danger and destruction in an\ninstant”. Bessarion felt that Venice—a city with which he\nhad entertained a long relationship and where he served as papal\nlegate in 1463—could be a safe haven for his library and the\nbooks he donated around 1468 formed the first nucleus of the\nBiblioteca Marciana. \nIn addition to saving books from destruction,\nBessarion had also a more practical political agenda for his homeland;\nhe was among the most vocal advocates for the call for a new crusade to\nfree Greece from Ottoman control. He was therefore engaged in\nseveral diplomatic missions, in Germany and then in Vienna, which\naimed to convince Western rulers to fight the Turks. After an attempt\nin 1464 failed because of the death of Pope Pius II in Ancona, Bessarion\nworked until the end of his days to build support \nfor a project that appeared more and more illusory with every passing\nyear. It was on the way back from one of these diplomatic missions in\n1472, this time to France, that Bessarion fell ill and died in\nRavenna. He was interred in his titular Church, SS. Apostoli in Rome,\nwhere Antoniazzo Romano and Melozzo da Forlì had decorated a\nchapel in his name between 1464 and 1467. \nBessarion’s opera omnia include writings prepared for\naudiences in both the Byzantine and the Roman courts, such as orations\nand pieces of poetry. Of particular interest are the orations he\naddressed to Italian rulers, in order to convince them to join a\ncrusade against the Turks (the Orationes ad principes Italiae\ncontra Turcos, 1470). The De errore Paschatis, devoted\nto calculating the proper date of Easter, was probably composed with\nthe assistance of Regiomontanus (1436–1476) and reflects\nBessarion’s early interest in astronomy, which he had cultivated\nsince the time of his training under Cortasmenos and Pletho. Bessarion\nalso left behind a rich corpus of letters which he had never edited for\npublication. In addition to being the patron of important translations, he\nalso himself translated Greek works into Latin, including Saint\nBasil’s De nativitate Domini, Xenophon’s\nMemorabilia, and Demosthenes’ First Olinthiac.\nHowever, Bessarion’s most important works, both as an\nauthor and as a translator, are focused on theology and\nphilosophy. \nDuring his years in Greece, Bessarion adopted traditionalist\npositions, which included hostility toward the tenets of the Roman\nChurch and Scholastic theology, which conflicted with the Hesicastic\ncontemplative doctrines still dominant in Greece at that time. The\nexperience of the Council of Ferrara-Florence led him to question and\nabandon some of his previous convictions. This is evident in the\nRefutationes of two writings, respectively by Maximus\nPlanudes (13–14th c.) and Marcos Eugenikos (d. 1444,\npresent himself at the Council), in which Bessarion defended the\nprocession of the Spirit from the Son. In other writings, and\nparticularly in the Encyclical letter to the Greeks, composed\nwhen he became Patriarch of Constantinople, he emphasized the primacy\nof the Roman Pontiff, inviting the Greeks to restore the union of the\ntwo Churches which had fallen apart after the Council. In On the\nEucharist, which he translated from Greek to Latin and\nre-elaborated several times over more than two decades, Bessarion\ndefended the epiclesis in the Orthodox Eucharist.  \nOne of the\nmost interesting theological writings by Bessarion, nonetheless, was\nprompted by a quarrel with George of Trebizond, which along with their\ndisagreements over George’s translations of the Aristotelian\nProblemata and Ptolemy’s Almagestus,\nultimately led to the deterioration of their relationship. When\ncommenting on John 21:22 during a banquet, Bessarion had observed that\nthe Latin text of the Vulgate Gospel was corrupted, and rather than reading\n“sic volo eum manere donec veniam, quid ad te?”, with\nreference to John, should have read “si volo eum manere donec\nveniam, quid ad te?”. George of Trebizond opposed the Cardinal,\ndefending the Vulgate. Bessarion reacted with a short writing, largely\nbased on the philological teachings of Nicholas Maniacutia\n(12th c.), which affirmed the necessity of verifying the\nLatin text of the Gospels against the original Greek. For Bessarion,\nrejection of George’s philological views went hand in hand with\na dismissal of his millenarian beliefs: by defending the version\ncontaining “sic”, George had in fact shown that he\naccepted the idea that John was alive and awaiting the second coming\nof Christ. George’s millenarianism resurfaced—with wider\nand different implications—during the Plato-Aristotle\ncontroversy, which represented the crux of his dispute with Bessarion\n(see below). \nBessarion’s reputation as a Platonist—mainly associated with\nhis struggle against the arch-Aristotelian George of\nTrebizond—has at times obscured in modern scholarship his\ncontribution to the Peripatetic tradition. By contrast,\nBessarion’s Aristotelian expertise was widely recognized in the\ncenturies after his death, when his translation of the\nMetaphysics was celebrated and reprinted several times, including in Bekker’s Corpus Aristotelicum (1831).\nUndertaken between 1446 and 1451 and dedicated to King Alfonso I of\nNaples, the translation was praised by Nicholas of Cusa for its\nexcellence, and by Giannozzo Manetti for its clarity, which he\nattributed to the Cardinal’s decision to render the text ad\nsensum, rather than ad verbum. \nIn addition to his\nlinguistic skills, Bessarion was aided in this enterprise by a deep\nknowledge of the Aristotelian works, cultivated since his\nBildungsjahre, as a number of studies on the contents of his\nlibrary have revealed. Bessarion was not only receptive to the\nAristotelian tradition, but also to its recent Latin development, as\nrepresented by Scholasticism. Again, studies of Bessarion’s\nlibrary have revealed this only apparently surprising aspect of his\nphilosophical training: Thomas Aquinas in particular was a well-known\nauthor in Byzantium, mostly because of the Greek translations of the\nSumma contra gentiles and of the Summa theologiae\nmade by Demetrios Kydones in the fourteenth century. Bessarion’s\nfamiliarity with these matters also influenced the In\ncalumniatorem Platonis, where one of the Cardinal’s\nrecurring arguments is that George of Trebizond was essentially\nignorant of the traditions (Aristotelianism and Scholasticism) he\nclaimed were superior to Platonism (see below). \nBessarion’s reputation as an expert in matters of Aristotelian\nand Scholastic philosophy is exemplified by his role as mediator in a\nquarrel over the future contingents between two theologians from\nLeuven, Henry of Zomeren and Peter de Rivo. From 1469 until his death,\nBessarion played an important role in this controversy not only\nbecause he had once been a patron of de Zomeren himself, but also\nbecause the Cardinal had gathered around him several skilled\nScholastic philosophers, including Francesco della Rovere (soon to be\nPope as Sixtus IV) and Fernando de Cordoba, both of whom took part in\nthe dispute. This was not the only circumstance in which Bessarion and\nmembers of his entourage took part in Scholastic disputes. For all\nthese reasons, the case of Bessarion calls into question the simplistic\nopposition between Aristotelian Scholasticism and a purely Platonic\nHumanism dear to past scholarship, showing instead the blurred lines\nbetween these traditions (see, e.g., Monfasani 2016b). Even the In\ncalumniatorem Platonis, a text consecrated even from its title to\nthe defense of Plato, was no less the result of this ambiguous\nrelationship between Humanism and Scholasticism, between Platonism and\nAristotelianism. \nGeorge of Trebizond’s resentment towards Bessarion was one of\nthe driving forces behind the Comparatio philosophorum Platonis et\nAristotelis (around 1458), in which George bitterly attacked\nPlato, a philosopher for whom the Cardinal’s preference was\nnotorious. In three books George attacked Plato as ignorant, impious\nand vicious, while celebrating the perfect wisdom, piety and virtue of\nAristotle. This kind of work, a comparison of the respective merits of\nPlato and Aristotle, especially in religious matters, was not uncommon\nin the Byzantine milieu, and Gemistus Pletho had composed his\nown comparatio at the time of the Council of Florence:\nPletho’s booklet, written in Greek and therefore little read,\ncelebrated the piety of Platonic philosophy in an attempt to expose\nthe frail Aristotelian foundation of Scholasticism. George’s\ncomparatio was by contrast intended to reinforce the role of Aristotle\nas authority of reference for Christian theology, to the extent of\nmaking the Stagirite aware of dogmas such as Trinity and occasionally placing him\nabove even Thomas Aquinas. George’s\ncomparatio had an apocalyptic subtext, made explicit in the\nfinal pages of the work, in which the coming of a fourth\nPlato—the second and the third were respectively Epicurus and\nMohammed—is connected to the fall of the Byzantine empire, and\ncharacterized as a threat to the Latin West. The unnamed fourth Plato\nwas possibly either Pletho or Bessarion himself. \nGeorge’s Comparatio was immediately perceived as\ndangerous by Bessarion, who needed to respond to it in order to\npreserve his reputation and that of Plato. If Plato was perceived as\nimpious, so too was the Cardinal by association. With the help of\nseveral members of his circle, Bessarion produced over the course of\nabout ten years his masterpiece: the In calumniatorem\nPlatonis (Against the Slanderer of Plato). \nThe preparation of the\nwork required several adjustments, both formal and theoretical. From a\nformal point of view, Bessarion realized that a work written in Greek,\nas the In calumniatorem initially was, would not have had the\ndesired impact. He therefore translated the work into Latin, and in\norder to make it stylistically appealing engaged a skilled Latinist,\nhis secretary Niccolò Perotti, to revise the text.\nPerotti’s re-elaboration made the work more accessible and\nelegant, though he occasionally struggled to do justice to the\nphilosophical concepts contained within. \nFrom a theoretical point of\nview, Bessarion was interested in a different kind of revision. Around\n1457, when he was involved in a debate on nature and art in an\nepistolary exchange with Theodore Gaza, Bessarion had initially\nargued, like his master Pletho, that Plato and Aristotle were\nirreconcilably opposed. Yet, the Cardinal changed this\nposition, after coming across a treatise—now lost—on the\nsame topic by George of Trebizond: in his own subsequent\nbooklet—the De natura et arte—destined to become\nthe sixth book of the In calumniatorem Platonis, Bessarion\nembraced a conciliatory view modeled on the approach of late-antique\ncommentator Simplicius. This interpretation—which is adopted\nthroughout the In calumniatorem—cast Aristotle as a\nnatural philosopher, and Plato as a theologian, thus explaining the\napparent disagreement between the two authors as merely a question of\ndifferent subject matter and of different levels of reality. This\nexegetical move allowed Bessarion to avoid openly attacking\nAristotle, while implicitly maintaining the superiority of Plato,\nin particular as an external aid for Christian faith. It also allowed him to avoid contrasts with Aristotelians in the Roman curia, and to rely on Scholastic authorities such as Albert the Great\nand Thomas Aquinas to meet his interpretative goals. \nThis arsenal of\nsources was crucial for exposing George’s scarce knowledge of\nAristotelian philosophy and tradition, and therefore the unreliability\nof his praise of the Stagirite’s alleged piety: this problem\nis the subject of the third book of the In calumniatorem\nPlatonis, which was composed at a later stage, mainly by the\nDominican theologian Giovanni Gatti (d. ante 1484). Finally,\nby defending the agreement between Plato and Aristotle, Bessarion\ncould also avoid any association with Gemistus Pletho, whose ambiguous\nreligious reputation could have tainted the Cardinal. \nThe In calumniatorem is divided into six books: books one, two\nand four mirror the three books of George’s\nComparatio. \nBook one focuses on proving Plato’s wisdom,\nin spite of the elusiveness of his style and the dialogical structure\nof his works, against George’s claim that he was ignorant. After\nlisting authors who praised Plato above Aristotle—mainly Cicero\nand Augustine, and several Fathers of the Church—Bessarion\ndiscusses the apparent absence of certain subjects in Plato’s\nworks by invoking the Pythagorean practice of secrecy. Yet, the Cardinal\nalso demonstrates that Plato was perfectly trained in all the\ndisciplines, and offered an alternative encyclopedia of wisdom\nto the Aristotelian one. \nThe second book is the closest to the\nByzantine tradition of the comparatio, and addresses the problem\nof Plato’s and Aristotle’s piety. Taking exegeses from\nauthors like Plotinus, Proclus, the Ps.-Dionysius, Simplicius, and\nmany others, Bessarion counter-analyzes the different subjects at the\ncenter of George’s invective, suggesting that Plato offered\ntheorizations of decisive topics such as creation, soul and matter\nthat were more akin to Christian dogma. Bessarion resolved\nembarrassing impasses in Plato’s philosophy, such as the\ndoctrine of matter and the doctrine of the metasomatosis as\npresented in the Timaeus, by employing elaborate distinctions\nin the first case, and allegorical explanation in the second, in the\nprocess making them acceptable to Christian readers. Again, Bessarion\nrepeatedly insists on the only apparent disagreement between Plato and\nAristotle: by recovering another argument from Simplicius, he claims\nthat the Stagirite attacked the words, and not the meaning of\nPlato’s doctrines, so as to preserve them from distortions and\nmanipulations. Aristotle, Bessarion claims, did the same with Parmenides and Melissus, who spoke\nas theologians no less than Plato. \nThe third book, as indicated above,\nreviews a number of problematic issues in George of Trebizond’s\ntreatment of Aristotle. Lighter topics—such as those related to\nsacrifices, and the reliance on poets and women—give\nway to more complex issues, such as Aristotle’s purported\nknowledge of Trinitarian dogma, his views on the immortality of the\nsoul, and the place of providence in Peripatetic cosmology.\nParticularly important here are the chapters centered on the\nimpossibility of the individual immortality of the soul in via\nAristotelis, since it contrasts with the eternity of the world\ndefended in On the Heavens. Bessarion, conversely, finds both\nAverroes’ and Alexander of Aphrodisias’ interpretations of\nthe soul acceptable according to the Aristotelian tenets, despite\ntheir contrast with the Christian faith. \nThe fourth book deals with\nthe problem of the virtue of Plato. Relying on Ps.-Dionysius,\nBessarion offers a spiritual interpretation of love—as described\nin the Symposium and in the Phaedrus—in\nradical contrast with the sexual one postulated by George. In a different section Bessarion employs Herodotus’s comparative method to justify the common use of women advocated by Plato\nin the Republic. Additionally, Bessarion defuses George’s millenarian\nprophecy about the fourth Plato by arguing that the fall of the Greek\nEmpire was due to an unescapable cyclical decline that the adoption of\nPlato’s doctrines would have forestalled. In the final chapter\nof the book, Bessarion rebukes George for his hypocrisy, since he\npraised Plato when he translated the Parmenides and the\nLaws. \nGeorge’s translation of the Laws is\nthe primary target of the fifth book, which contains a list of the\nerrors—actual and alleged—made by Trebizond in his\nedition. The goal of this chapter is to prove George’s\nincompetence in Platonic philosophy, which in turn further proves the\nunreliability of his accusations against Plato. Yet, a peculiar\nconcern with the translation of Platonic works runs throughout the\nentire In calumniatorem: Bessarion was aware that Latin\nEuropeans’ scarce knowledge of Plato might have inclined them to\nlisten to George of Trebizond. Bessarion’s practice of offering\nin his work translations of Platonic texts, accompanied by alternative\nexegeses to those offered by George—was intended to correct this\nknowledge gap in the Western world. Bessarion also presented to his\nLatin readers Aristotelian authors, such as Alexander of Aphrodisias,\nwho had until then limited circulation in the Latin world, but whose\ninterpretations of Aristotle placed the Stagirite in contradiction\nwith Christian dogma. These insertions were part of Bessarion’s\nstrategy for exposing the religious limits of Aristotelian\nphilosophy, so providing implicit support for the notion that Plato\ncould serve as a better external aid for true faith, in the tradition\nof the Church Fathers, and of Greek theologians such as Eusebius of\nCesarea and Theodore Metochites. \nThe sixth book of the In\ncalumniatorem, the above-mentioned De natura et arte, is the exegesis of a passage from the second book of the\nAristotelian Physics. Written before the other books\ncomposing the In calumniatorem, it is the only one in which\nBessarion openly names George as his adversary and—as stated\nabove—is the first work in which Bessarion expresses\nconciliaristic views about Plato and Aristotle. In this sense the De natura et arte\nrepresented a sort of “dress rehearsal” for the magnum\nopus applied to a single exegetical problem, which had\nnonetheless significant implications for crucial subjects (such as the\ndoctrine of Ideas and divine causality in the world). \nWhile George’s Comparatio appeared in print only\nposthumously in 1523 in a single defective edition, Bessarion took\nfull advantage of the newly discovered technology of the printing press to reach his\naudience: it offered Bessarion another advantage over his\nopponent by ensuring wider circulation of the finished text. The In\ncalumniatorem Platonis was printed in 1469 by Schweynheym and\nPannartz. In the very the same year they also published\nAlcinous’s Didaskalikon, and Apuleius’s De\ndeo Socratis and De Platone et eius dogmate, probably as\npart of a filo-Platonic editorial project orchestrated by\nthe Cardinal. The In calumniatorem was subsequently reprinted\ntwice, by the Aldine printing press, in 1503 and 1516. Both editions,\nwhich are not identical, included Bessarion’s own revisions to\nthe 1469 version of the text. \nBessarion’s moderate Christianized\nreading of Plato provided authors like Marsilio Ficino and Francesco\nCattani da Diacceto with powerful exegetical schemes, such as those\ntaken from Plotinus, Proclus, and the Ps.-Dionysius (whose\nauthenticity Bessarion defended even against members of his own\ncircle). In the case of Ficino, these interpretive keys were magnified\nin an even more ambitious Christianization of Plato, in which the\nancient philosopher was compared to Moses. A monumental work which\nincluded several lists of quotations and authorities, the In\ncalumniatorem quickly became a repertory of material for\nsixteenth-century writers and philosophers. Sections like those on the\nPythagorean secrets (I.2) enjoyed the attention of numerous readers,\nas did the letter of Lysis to Hipparchus. Louis le Roy (d. 1577)\nrelied heavily on the second book of the In calumniatorem for\nhis commentary to the Timaeus. Without citing his source, Symphorien Champier (d. 1540)\nrecovered passages from the In calumniatorem in many\nof his works. Champier wanted to convince his friend Jacques Lefèvre\nd’Étaples (d. 1536) of Plato’s utility for\nChristian religion and the In calumniatorem offered a wealth of material to support his efforts. Though he admired Bessarion’s translation of\nthe Metaphysics, which he was the first to publish,\nLefèvre d’Étaples—along with Guillaume\nBudé—nonetheless favored the position of George of\nTrebizond.  \nThe composite nature of the In calumniatorem\nallowed for divergent interpretations of the nature of\nBessarion’s work. In the In calumniatorem Bessarion\nhimself oscillated between describing the text as an apology of Plato\nand as a comparison between Plato and Aristotle. Despite the fact that\nthe In calumniatorem helped to disseminate the genre\nthe comparatio Platonis et Aristotelis in the\nearly modern period, the work was mostly perceived as an apology of\nPlato, and this made Bessarion an obvious target at the time of\nthe anti-Platonic reaction led by the Jesuits at the end of the sixteenth\ncentury. Members of other orders, like the Franciscans and\nAugustinians, were nonetheless more sympathetic to the Cardinal,\npraising him and the In calumniatorem well into the\nseventeenth century. Bessarion also made an impact within the walls of the universities.\nHis emphasis on Aristotle as a mere natural philosopher, in fact,\nprovided Peripatetic professors with valid arguments against\nmetaphysical interpretations of the Philosopher: for example, both Pietro\nPomponazzi (1462–1525) and Francesco Vimercato (d. 1569), though\narguing in favor of the mortality of the soul from different\nperspectives, were in debt to passages from the third book of the\nIn calumniatorem Platonis.
