In his work, and in that of the other algebraists\nof the algebraic tradition of logic of the nineteenth century, the\ndistinction between a formal language and a mathematically rigorous\nsemantics for it was still not drawn. What the algebraists in this\ntradition did was to build algebraic theories (of Boolean algebras,\nand relation algebras) with among other interpretations a logical one.\n\n\n\nThe works of Frege and Russell introduced a different perspective on\nthe way to approach logic. In those works, a logic system was given by\na formal language and a deductive calculus, namely a set of axioms and\na set of inference rules. Let us (for this entry) call such a pair a\nlogical deduction system, and the formulas derivable in the\ncalculus its theorems (nowadays it is common practice in\nalgebraic logic to refer to this kind of calculi as Hilbert-style and\nin proof complexity theory as Frege systems). In Frege and\nRussell’s approach, a formal (mathematical) semantics of\nwhatever kind (algebraic, model-theoretic, etc.) for the formal\nlanguages they used was lacking. The only semantics present was of an\nintuitive, informal kind. \n\n\nThe systems introduced by Frege and Russell were systems of classical\nlogic, but soon after systems of non-classical logics were considered\nby other logicians. The first influential attempts to introduce logics\ndifferent from classical logic remained within the Frege-Russell\ntradition of presenting a logical deduction system without any formal\nsemantics. These attempts lead to the first modal systems of C.I.\nLewis (1918, 1932) and to the\naxiomatization of intuitionistic logic by Heyting (1930).\n\n\nThe idea underlying the design of Frege and Russell’s logical\ndeduction systems is that the theorems should be the formulas that\ncorrespond (intuitively) to the logical truths or logical validities.\nThe concept of logical consequence was not central to the development,\nand this was also the case in the many systems of non-classical logics\nthat were to be designed following in the footsteps of the first modal\nsystems of C.I. Lewis. This situation influenced the way in which the\nresearch on some non-classical logics has usually been presented and\nsometimes also its real evolution. However, the concept of logical\nconsequence has been the one that logic has traditionally dealt with.\nTarski put it once again into the center of modern logic, both\nsemantically and syntactically. Nowadays, a general theory of the\nalgebraization of logics around the concept of logical consequence has\ngrown from the different algebraic treatments of the different logics\nobtained during the last century. \n\n\nThe concept of logical consequence has proved much more fruitful than\nthose of theorem and of logical validity for the development of such a\ngeneral theory. The first attempts in the process of building the\ngeneral theory of the algebraization of logics can be found in the\nstudy of the class of implicative logics by Rasiowa (1974) and in the\nsystematic presentation by Wójcicki (1988) of the\ninvestigations of a general nature on propositional logics as\nconsequence operations carried out mainly by Polish logicians,\nfollowing the studies of Tarski, Lindenbaum, Łukasiewicz and\nothers in the first part of the twentieth century. \n\n\nIt was only in the 1920s that algebras and logical matrices (an\nalgebra together with a set of designated elements) started to be\ntaken as models of logical deduction systems, that is, as providing a\nformal semantics for formal languages of logic. Moreover, they were\nalso used to define sets of formulas with similar properties to the\nones the sets of theorems of the known logical deduction systems have,\nin particular the property of being closed under substitution\ninstances; more recently logical matrices have also been used to\ndefine logics as consequence relations. \n\n\nAlgebraic logic can be described in very general terms as the\ndiscipline that studies logics by associating with them classes of\nalgebras, classes of logical matrices and other algebra related\nmathematical structures and that relates the properties that the\nlogics may have with properties of the associated algebras (or algebra\nrelated structures) with the purpose that the understanding of these\nalgebras can be used to better understand the logic at hand. \n\n\nFrom the algebraic study of particular logics a general theory of the\nalgebraization of logics slowly emerged during the last century with\nthe aim, more or less explicitly stated during the process, of\nobtaining general and informative results relating the properties a\nlogic may have with the algebraic properties the class of algebras (or\nalgebra related structures) associated with it might enjoy. Those\nalgebraic studies assumed somehow an implicit conception of what is\nthe process by which to associate with any given logic a class of\nalgebras as its natural algebraic counterpart. The development of the\ngeneral theory speeded up and consolidated at the beginning of the\n1980s with the introduction of the notion of algebraizable logic, and\nat that time the assumptions about the class of algebras that deserve\nto be taken as the natural to associate with a given logic started to\nbe made more and more explicit. \n\n\nIn this entry we concentrate on the general theory of the\nalgebraization of propositional logics taken as consequence relations.\nThis theory has evolved into the field known as Abstract Algebraic\nLogic (AAL). The entry can be taken as a mild introduction to this\nfield. \n\nTarski’s work (1930a, 1930b, 1935, 1936) on the methodology of\nthe deductive sciences of the 1920s and 1930s studies the axiomatic\nmethod abstractly and introduces for the first time the abstract\nconcept of consequence operation. Tarski had in mind mainly the\ndifferent mathematical axiomatic theories. On these theories, the\nsentences that are proved from the axioms are consequences of them but\n(of course) almost all of them are not logical truths; under a\nsuitable formalization of these theories, a logical calculus like\nFrege’s or Russell’s can be used to derive the\nconsequences of the axioms. Tarski set the framework to study the most\ngeneral properties of the operation that assigns to a set of axioms\nits consequences. \nGiven a logical deduction system \\(H\\) and an arbitrary set of\nformulas \\(X\\), a formula \\(a\\) is deducible in \\(H\\) from\n\\(X\\) if there is a finite sequence of formulas any one of which\nbelongs to \\(X\\) or is an axiom of \\(H\\) or is obtained from previous\nformulas in the sequence by one of the inference rules of \\(H\\). Such\na sequence is a deduction (or proof) in \\(H\\) of \\(a\\) with premises\nor hypotheses in \\(X\\). Let \\(Cn(X)\\) be the set of formulas deducible\nin \\(H\\) from the formulas in \\(X\\) taken as premises or hypothesis.\nThis set is called the set of consequences of \\(X\\) (relative to the\nlogical deduction system \\(H\\)). \\(Cn\\) is then an operation that is\napplied to sets of formulas to obtain new sets of formulas. It has the\nfollowing properties: For every set of formulas \\(X\\) \nClause 3 stipulates that \\(Cn(X)\\) is equal to the union of the set of\nformulas derivable from finite subsets of \\(X\\). Tarski took these\nproperties to define the notion of consequence operation\naxiomatically. In fact he added that there is a formula \\(x\\) such\nthat \\(Cn(\\{x\\})\\) is the set \\(A\\) of all the formulas and that this\nset must be finite or of the cardinality of the natural numbers.\nCondition (3) implies the weaker, and important, condition of\nmonotonicity \nTo encompass the whole class of logic systems one finds in the\nliterature, a slightly more general definition than Tarski’s is\nrequired. We will say that an abstract consequence operation\n\\(C\\) on an arbitrary set \\(A\\) is an operation that applied to\nsubsets of \\(A\\) gives subsets of \\(A\\) and for all \\(X, Y \\subseteq\nA\\) satisfies conditions (1), (2) and (4) above. If in addition \\(C\\)\nsatisfies (3) we say that it is a finitary consequence\noperation.  \nConsequence operations are present not only in logic but in many areas\nof mathematics. Abstract consequence operations are known as closure\noperators in universal algebra and lattice theory, for instance. In\ntopology the operation that sends a subset of a topological space to\nits topological closure is a closure operator. In fact the topologies\non a set \\(A\\) can be identified with the closure operators on \\(A\\)\nthat satisfy the additional conditions that \\(C(\\varnothing) =\n\\varnothing\\) and \\(C(X \\cup Y) = C(X) \\cup C(Y)\\) for all \\(X, Y\n\\subseteq A\\).  \nGiven a consequence operation \\(C\\) on a set \\(A\\), a subset \\(X\\) of\n\\(A\\) is said to be \\(C\\)-closed, or a closed set of\n\\(C\\), if \\(C(X) = X\\).  \nA different, but mathematically equivalent, (formal) approach is to\nconsider consequence relations on a set of formulas instead of\nconsequence operations. A(n) (abstract) consequence relation\non the set of formulas of a formal language is a relation \\(\\vdash\\)\nbetween sets of formulas and formulas that satisfies the following\nconditions: \nIt is finitary if in addition it satisfies \nGiven a logical deduction system \\(H\\), the relation \\(\\vdash\\)\ndefined by \\(X \\vdash a\\) if \\(a\\) is deducible from \\(X\\) in \\(H\\) is\na finitary consequence relation. Nonetheless, we are used not only to\nsyntactic definitions of consequence relations but also to semantic\ndefinitions. For example, we define classical propositional\nconsequence using truth valuations, first-order consequence relation\nusing structures, intuitionistic consequence relation using Kripke\nmodels, etc. Sometimes these model-theoretic definitions of\nconsequence relations define non-finitary consequence relations, for\nexample, the consequence relations for infinitary formal languages and\nthe consequence relation of second-order logic with the so-called\nstandard semantics.  \nIn general, an abstract consequence relation on a set \\(A\\)\n(not necessarily the set of formulas of some formal language) is a\nrelation \\(\\vdash\\) between subsets of \\(A\\) and elements of \\(A\\)\nthat satisfies conditions (1)–(3) above. If it also satisfies\n(4) it is said to be finitary. If \\(\\vdash\\) is an abstract\nconsequence relation and \\(X \\vdash a\\) we can say that \\(X\\) is a set\nof premises or hypothesis with conclusion \\(a\\) according to\n\\(\\vdash\\) and that \\(a\\) follows from \\(X\\), or is entailed by \\(X\\)\n(according to \\(\\vdash)\\). These relations correspond to\nKoslow’s implication structures; see Koslow 1992 for the closely\nrelated but different approach to logics (in a broad sense) as\nconsequence relations introduced by this author.  \nConsequence operations on a set \\(A\\) are in one-to-one correspondence\nwith abstract consequence relations on \\(A\\). The move from a\nconsequence operation \\(C\\) to a consequence relation \\(\\vdash_C\\)\nand, conversely, from a consequence relation \\(\\vdash\\) to a\nconsequence operation \\(C_{\\vdash}\\) is easy and given by the\ndefinitions: \nMoreover, if \\(C\\) is finitary, so is \\(\\vdash_C\\) and if \\(\\vdash\\)\nis finitary, so is \\(C_{\\vdash}\\).  \nFor a general discussion on logical consequence see the entry\n Logical Consequence. \nIn this section we define what propositional logics are and explain\nthe basic concepts relating to them. We will call the propositional\nlogics (as defined below) simply logic systems.  \nOne of the main traits of the consequence relations we study in logic\nis their formal character. This roughly means that if a sentence \\(a\\)\nfollows from a set of sentences \\(X\\) and we have another sentence\n\\(b\\) and another set of sentences \\(Y\\) that share the same form with\n\\(a\\) and \\(X\\) respectively, then \\(b\\) also follows from \\(Y\\). In\npropositional logics this boils down to saying that if we uniformly\nreplace basic sub-sentences of the sentences in \\(X \\cup \\{a\\}\\) by\nother sentences obtaining \\(Y\\) and \\(b\\), then \\(b\\) follows from\n\\(Y\\). (The reader can find more information on the idea of formality\nin the entry\n Logical Consequence.)\n  \nTo turn the idea of the formal character of logics into a rigorous\ndefinition we need to introduce the concept of propositional language\nand the concept of substitution.  \nA propositional language \\(L\\) is a set of connectives, that\nis, a set of symbols each one of which has an arity \\(n\\) that tells\nus in case that \\(n = 0\\) that the symbol is a propositional constant,\nand in case that \\(n \\gt 0\\) whether the connective is unary, binary,\nternary, etc. For example \\(\\{\\wedge , \\vee , \\rightarrow , \\bot ,\n\\top \\}\\) is (or can be) the language of several logics, like\nclassical and intuitionistic, \\((\\bot\\) and \\(\\top\\) are 0-ary and the\nother connectives are binary), \\(\\{\\neg , \\wedge , \\vee \\rightarrow ,\n\\Box , \\Diamond \\}\\) is the language of several modal logics, \\((\\neg\n, \\Box , \\Diamond\\) are unary and the other connectives binary) and\n\\(\\{ \\wedge , \\vee , \\rightarrow , * , \\top , \\bot , 1, 0\\}\\) is the\nlanguage of many-valued logics and also of a fragment of linear logic\n\\((\\bot , \\top , 1\\), and 0 are propositional constants and the other\nsymbols binary connectives).  \nGiven a language \\(L\\) and a set of propositional variables \\(V\\)\n(which is disjoint from \\(L)\\), the formulas of \\(L\\), or\n\\(L\\)-formulas, are defined inductively as follows: \nA substitution \\(\\sigma\\) for \\(L\\) is a map from the set of\nvariables \\(V\\) to the set of formulas of \\(L\\). It tells us which\nformula must replace which variable when we perform the substitution.\nIf \\(p\\) is a variable, \\(\\sigma(p)\\) denotes the formula that the\nsubstitution \\(\\sigma\\) assigns to \\(p\\). The result of applying a\nsubstitution \\(\\sigma\\) to a formula \\(\\phi\\) is the formula\n\\(\\bsigma(\\phi)\\) obtained from \\(\\phi\\) by simultaneously replacing\nthe variables in \\(\\phi\\), say \\(p_1 , \\ldots ,p_k\\), by,\nrespectively, the formulas \\(\\sigma(p_1), \\ldots ,\\sigma(p_k)\\). In\nthis way a substitution \\(\\sigma\\) gives a unique map \\(\\bsigma\\) from\nthe set of formulas to itself that satisfies \nA formula \\(\\psi\\) is a substitution instance of a formula\n\\(\\phi\\) if there is a substitution \\(\\sigma\\) such that when applied\nto \\(\\phi\\) gives \\(\\psi\\), that is, if \\(\\bsigma(\\phi) = \\psi\\).  \nIn order to avoid unnecessary complications we will assume in the\nsequel that all the logics use the same set \\(V\\) of variables, so\nthat the definition of formula of \\(L\\) depends only on \\(L\\). A\nlogic system (or logic for short) is given by a\nlanguage \\(L\\) and a consequence relation \\(\\vdash\\) on the set of\nformulas of \\(L\\) that is formal in the sense that for every\nsubstitution \\(\\sigma\\), every set of formulas \\(\\Gamma\\) and every\nformula \\(\\phi\\), \nwhere \\(\\bsigma[\\Gamma]\\) is the set of the formulas obtained by\napplying the substitution \\(\\sigma\\) to the formulas in \\(\\Gamma\\).\nThe consequence relations on the set of formulas of a language that\nsatisfy this property are called structural and also\nsubstitution-invariant in the literature. They were\nconsidered for the first time in Łoś & Suszko 1958.\nTarski only explicitly considered closed sets also closed under\nsubstitution instances for some consequence relations; he never\nconsidered (at least explicitly) the substitution invariance condition\nfor consequence relations.  \nWe will refer to logic systems by the letter \\(\\bL\\) with possible\nsubindices, and we set \\(\\bL = \\langle L, \\vdash_{\\bL } \\rangle\\) and\n\\(\\bL_n = \\langle L_n, \\vdash_{\\bL_n } \\rangle\\) with the\nunderstanding that \\(L \\; (L_n)\\) is the language of \\(\\bL \\;(\\bL_n)\\) and\n\\(\\vdash_{\\bL }\\; (\\vdash_{\\bL_n })\\) its consequence relation. A logic\nsystem \\(\\bL\\) is finitary if \\(\\vdash_{\\bL}\\) is a finitary\nconsequence relation.  \nThe consequence relation of a logic system can be given in several\nways, some using proof-theoretic tools, others semantic means. One can\ndefine a substitution-invariant consequence relation using a proof\nsystem like a Hilbert-style axiom system, a Gentzen-style sequent\ncalculus or a natural deduction style calculus, etc. One can also\ndefine a substitution-invariant consequence relation semantically\nusing a class of mathematical objects (algebras, Kripke models,\ntopological models, etc.) and a satisfaction relation.  \nIf \\(\\bL_1 = \\langle L,\\vdash_{\\bL_1 } \\rangle\\) is a logic system\nwith \\(\\vdash_{\\bL_1}\\) defined by a proof-system and \\(\\bL_2 =\n\\langle L, \\vdash_{\\bL_2 } \\rangle\\) is a logic system over the same\nlanguage with \\(\\vdash_{\\bL_2}\\) defined semantically, we say that the\nproof-system used to define \\(\\vdash_{\\bL_1}\\) is sound for\nthe semantics used to define \\(\\vdash_{\\bL_2}\\) if \\(\\vdash_{\\bL_1}\\)\nis included in \\(\\vdash_{\\bL_2}\\), namely if \\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL_1 }\n\\phi\\) implies \\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL_2 } \\phi\\). If the other inclusion\nholds the proof-system is said to be complete with respect to\nthe semantics that defines \\(\\vdash_{\\bL_2}\\), that is when \\(\\Gamma\n\\vdash_{\\bL_2 } \\phi\\) implies \\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL_1 } \\phi\\).  \nA set of \\(L\\)-formulas \\(\\Gamma\\) is called a theory of a\nlogic system \\(\\bL\\), or \\(\\bL\\)-theory, if it is closed under the\nrelation \\(\\vdash_{\\bL}\\), that is, if whenever \\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL }\n\\phi\\) it also holds that \\(\\phi \\in \\Gamma\\). In other words, the\ntheories of \\(\\bL\\) are the closed sets of the consequence operation\n\\(C_{\\vdash_{ \\bL}}\\) on the set of \\(L\\)-formulas. In order to\nsimplify the notation we denote this consequence operation by\n\\(C_{\\bL}\\). A formula \\(\\phi\\) is a theorem (or validity) of\n\\(\\bL\\) if \\(\\varnothing \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\). Then \\(C_{\\bL\n}(\\varnothing)\\) is the set of theorems of \\(\\bL\\) and is the least\ntheory of \\(\\bL\\). The set of all theories of \\(\\bL\\) will be denoted\nby \\(\\tTH(\\bL)\\).  \nGiven a logic \\(\\bL\\), the consequence operation \\(C_{\\bL}\\) is\nsubstitution-invariant, which means that for every set of\n\\(L\\)-formulas \\(\\Gamma\\) and every substitution\n\\(\\sigma,\\bsigma[C_{\\bL}(\\Gamma)] \\subseteq C_{\\bL}(\\bsigma[\\Gamma]\\)). Moreover,\nfor every theory \\(T\\) of \\(\\bL\\) we have a new consequence operation\ndefined as follows: \n\n\\[C_{\\bL }^T (\\Gamma) = C_{\\bL }(T \\cup \\Gamma)\\]\n\n that is, \\(C_{\\bL }^T (\\Gamma)\\) is\nthe set of formulas that follow from \\(\\Gamma\\) and \\(T\\) according to\n\\(\\bL\\). It turns out that \\(T\\) is closed under substitutions if and\nonly if \\(C_{\\bL }^T\\) is substitution-invariant.  \nIf \\(\\bL\\) is a logic and \\(\\Gamma , \\Delta\\) are sets of\n\\(L\\)-formulas, we will use the notation \\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL }\n\\Delta\\) to state that for every \\(\\psi \\in \\Delta , \\Gamma\n\\vdash_{\\bL } \\psi\\). Thus \\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\Delta\\) if and only\nif \\(\\Delta \\subseteq C_{\\bL }(\\Gamma)\\). \nIf \\(\\bL = \\langle L, \\vdash_{\\bL } \\rangle\\) is a logic system \\(\\bL'\n= \\langle L', \\vdash_{\\bL' } \\rangle\\) whose language is \\(L'\\) (hence\nall the \\(L'\\)-formulas are \\(L\\)-formulas) and whose consequence\nrelation is defined by \n\n\\[\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL' } \\phi \\txtiff \\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi,\\]\n\n for every set of \\(L'\\)-formulas\n\\(\\Gamma\\) and every \\(L'\\)-formula \\(\\phi\\). In this situation we\nalso say that \\(\\bL\\) is an expansion of \\(\\bL'\\).  \nWe give some examples of logic systems that we will refer to in the\ncourse of this essay, which are assembled here for the reader’s\nconvenience. Whenever possible we refer to the corresponding\nentries. \nWe use the standard convention of writing \\((\\phi * \\psi)\\) instead of\n\\(* \\phi \\psi\\) for binary connectives and omit the external\nparenthesis in the formulas.  \nWe take the language of Classical propositional logic \\(\\bCPL\\) to be\nthe set \\(L_c = \\{\\wedge , \\vee , \\rightarrow , \\top , \\bot \\},\\) \nwhere \n\\(\\wedge , \\vee , \\rightarrow\\) are binary connectives and \\(\\top , \\bot\\)\npropositional constants. We\nassume the consequence relation defined by the usual truth-table\nmethod \\((\\top\\) is interpreted as true\nand \\(\\bot\\) as false), that is, \n\\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bCPL } \\phi\\txtiff\\) every truth valuation that\nassigns true to all \\(\\psi \\in \\Gamma\\)\nassigns true to \\(\\phi\\). \nThe formulas \\(\\phi\\) such that \\(\\varnothing \\vdash_{\\bCPL } \\phi\\)\nare the tautologies. Note that using the language \\(L_c\\),\nthe negation of a formula \\(\\phi\\) is defined as \\(\\phi \\rightarrow\n\\bot\\). For more information, see the entry on\n classical logic\n  \nWe take the language of Intuitionistic propositional logic to be the\nsame as that of classical propositional logic, namely the set\n\\(\\{\\wedge , \\vee , \\rightarrow , \\top , \\bot \\}\\). The consequence\nrelation is defined by the following Hilbert-style calculus. \nAll the formulas of the forms \nFor more information, see the entry on\n intuitionistic logic\n  \nThe language of modal logic we consider here is the set \\(L_m =\n\\{\\wedge , \\vee , \\rightarrow , \\neg , \\Box , \\top , \\bot \\}\\) that\nexpands \\(L_c\\) by adding the unary connective \\(\\Box\\). In the standard literature on\nmodal logic a normal modal logic is defined not as a consequence\nrelation but as a set of formulas with certain properties. A\nnormal modal logic is a set \\(\\Lambda\\) of formulas of\n\\(L_m\\) which contains all the tautologies of the language of\nclassical logic, the formulas of the form \n\n\\[\\Box(\\phi \\rightarrow \\psi) \\rightarrow(\\Box \\phi \\rightarrow \\Box \\psi)\\]\n\n and is closed\nunder the rules  \nNote that the set \\(\\Lambda\\) is closed under substitution instances,\nnamely for every substitution \\(\\sigma\\), if \\(\\phi \\in L_m\\), then\n\\(\\bsigma(\\phi) \\in L_m\\).  \nThe least normal modal logic is called \\(K\\) and can be axiomatized by\nthe Hilbert-style calculus with axioms the tautologies of classical logic\nand the formulas \\(\\Box(\\phi \\rightarrow \\psi) \\rightarrow(\\Box \\phi\n\\rightarrow \\Box \\psi)\\), and with rules of inference Modus Ponens,\nModal Generalization and Substitution.  \nWith a normal modal logic \\(\\Lambda\\) it is associated the consequence\nrelation defined by the calculus that takes as axioms all the formulas\nin \\(\\Lambda\\) and as the only rule of inference Modus Ponens. The\nlogic system given by this consequence relation is called the\nlocal consequence of \\(\\Lambda\\). We denote it by\n\\(\\blLambda\\). Its theorems are the elements of \\(\\Lambda\\). It holds\nthat \n\\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\blLambda} \\phi\\txtiff\\phi \\in \\Lambda\\) or there are\n\\(\\phi_1 , \\ldots ,\\phi_n \\in \\Gamma\\) such that \\((\\phi_1 \\wedge\n\\ldots \\wedge \\phi_n) \\rightarrow \\phi \\in \\Lambda\\). \nAnother consequence relation is associated with each normal modal\nlogic \\(\\Lambda\\). It is defined by the calculus that has as axioms\nthe formulas of \\(\\Lambda\\) and as rules of inference Modus Ponens and\nModal Generalization. The logic system given by this consequence\nrelation is called the global consequence of \\(\\Lambda\\) and\nwill be denoted by \\(\\bgLambda\\). It has the same theorems as the\nlocal \\(\\blLambda\\), namely the elements of \\(\\Lambda\\). The\ndifference between \\(\\blLambda\\) and \\(\\bgLambda\\) lies in the\nconsequences they allow to draw from nonempty sets of premises. This\ndifference has an enormous effect on their algebraic behavior. \nFor more information on modal logic, see the entry on\n modal logic.\n The reader can find specific information on modal logics as\nconsequence relations in Kracht 2006. \nWe take as the language of Intuitionistic Linear Logic without\nexponentials the set \\(\\{\\wedge , \\vee , \\rightarrow , * , 0, 1, \\top\n, \\bot \\}\\), where \\(\\wedge , \\vee , \\rightarrow, *\\) are binary connectives and \\(0, 1,\\top , \\bot\\) \npropositional constants. We denote the logic by \\(\\bILL\\). The axioms and rule of\ninference below provide a Hilbert-style axiomatization of this logic.\n \nThe 0-ary connective 0 is used to define a negation by \\(\\neg \\phi :=\n\\phi \\rightarrow 0\\). No specific axiom schema deals with 0.  \nFor more information, see the entry on\n linear logic\n  \nThe language we consider is the set \\(\\{\\wedge , \\vee , \\rightarrow ,\n\\neg \\}\\), where \\(\\wedge , \\vee , \\rightarrow\\) are binary connectives and \\(\\neg\\) a unary connective. A Hilbert style axiomatization for \\(\\bR\\) can be given by\nthe rules of Intuitionistic Linear Logic without exponentials and the\naxioms L2, L3, L7-L12 of this logic together with the axioms \nFor more information, see the entry on\n relevance logic. \nThe algebraic study of a particular logic has to provide first of all\nits formal language with an algebraic semantics using a class of\nalgebras whose properties are exploited to understand which properties\nthe logic has. In this section, we present how the formal languages of\npropositional logics are given an algebraic interpretation. In the\nnext section, we address the question of what is an algebraic\nsemantics for a logic system. \nWe start by describing the first two steps involved in the algebraic\nstudy of propositional logics. Both are needed in order to endow\npropositional languages with algebraic interpretations. To expound\nthem we will assume knowledge of first-order logic (see the entries on\n classical logic\n and\n first-order model theory)\n and we will call algebraic first-order languages, or simply\nalgebraic languages, the first-order languages with equality\nand without any relational symbols, so that these languages have only\noperation symbols (also called function symbols), if any, in the set\nof their non-logical symbols.  \nThe two steps we are about to expound can be summarized in the slogan:\n \nPropositional formulas are terms. \nThe first step consist in looking at the formulas of any\npropositional language \\(L\\) as the terms of the algebraic first-order\nlanguage with \\(L\\) as its set of operation symbols. This means that\n(i) every connective of \\(L\\) of arity \\(n\\) is taken as an operation\nsymbol of arity \\(n\\) (thus every 0-ary symbol of \\(L\\) is taken as an\nindividual constant) and that (ii) the propositional formulas of \\(L\\)\nare taken as the terms of this first-order language; in particular the\npropositional variables are the variables of the first-order language.\nFrom this point of view the definition of \\(L\\)-formula is exactly the\ndefinition of \\(L\\)-term. We will refer to the algebraic language with\n\\(L\\) as its set of operation symbols as the \\(L\\)-algebraic\nlanguage.  \nThe second step is to interpret the propositional formulas in\nthe same manner in which terms of a first-order language are\ninterpreted in a structure. In this way the concept of \\(L\\)-algebra\ncomes into play. On a given set \\(A\\), an \\(n\\)-ary connective is\ninterpreted by a \\(n\\)-ary function on \\(A\\) (a map that assigns an\nelement of \\(A\\) to every sequence \\(\\langle a_1 , \\ldots\n,a_n\\rangle\\) of elements of \\(A)\\). This procedure is a\ngeneralization of the truth-table interpretations of the languages of\nlogic systems like classical logic and Łukasiewicz and\nPost’s finite-valued logics. In those cases, given the set of\ntruth-values at play the function that interprets a connective is\ngiven by its truth-table. \nA way to introduce algebras is as the models of some algebraic\nfirst-order language. We follow an equivalent route and give the\ndefinition of algebra using the setting of propositional languages.\nLet \\(L\\) be a propositional language. An algebra \\(\\bA\\) of\ntype \\(L\\), or \\(L\\)-algebra for short, is a set \\(A\\), called the\ncarrier of \\(\\bA\\), together with a function \\(* ^{\\bA}\\) on \\(A\\) of\nthe arity of \\(*\\), for every connective \\(*\\) in \\(L\\) (if \\(*\\) is\n0-ary, \\(* ^{\\bA}\\) is an element of \\(A)\\). An algebra \\(\\bA\\) is\ntrivial if its carrier is a one element set. \nA valuation on an \\(L\\)-algebra \\(\\bA\\) is a map \\(v\\) from\nthe set of variables into its carrier \\(A\\). Algebras together with\nvaluations are used to interpret in a compositional way the formulas\nof \\(L\\), assuming that a connective \\(*\\) of \\(L\\) is interpreted in\nan \\(L\\)-algebra \\(\\bA\\) by the function \\(* ^{\\bA}\\). Let \\(\\bA\\) be\nan algebra of type \\(L\\) and \\(v\\) a valuation on \\(\\bA\\). The value\nof a compound formula \\(* \\phi_1 \\ldots \\phi_n\\) is computed by\napplying the function \\(* ^{\\bA}\\) that interprets \\(*\\) in \\(\\bA\\) to\nthe previously computed values \\(\\bv(\\phi_1), \\ldots ,\\bv(\\phi_n)\\) of\nthe formulas \\(\\phi_1 ,\\ldots ,\\phi_n\\). Precisely speaking the value\n\\(\\bv(\\phi)\\) of a formula \\(\\phi\\) is defined inductively as\nfollows: \nNote that in this way we have obtained a map \\(\\bv\\) from the set of\n\\(L\\)-formulas to the carrier of \\(\\bA\\). It is important to notice\nthat the value of a formula under a valuation depends only on the\npropositional variables that actually appear in the formula.\nAccordingly, if \\(\\phi\\) is a formula we use the notation \\(\\phi(p_1 ,\n\\ldots ,p_n)\\) to indicate that the variables that appear in \\(\\phi\\)\nare in the list \\(p_1 , \\ldots ,p_n\\), and given elements \\(a_1 ,\n\\ldots ,a_n\\) of an algebra \\(\\bA\\) by \\(\\phi^{\\bA }[a_1 , \\ldots\n,a_n]\\) we refer to the value of \\(\\phi(p_1 , \\ldots ,p_n)\\) under any\nvaluation \\(v\\) on \\(\\bA\\) such that \\(v(p_1) = a_1 , \\ldots ,v(p_n) =\na_n\\).  \nA third and fundamental step in the algebraic study\nof logics is to turn the set of formulas of a language \\(L\\) into an\nalgebra, the algebra of formulas of \\(L\\), denoted by\n\\(\\bFm_L\\). This algebra has the set of \\(L\\)-formulas as carrier and\nthe operations are defined as follows. For every \\(n\\)-ary connective\n\\(*\\) with \\(n \\gt 0\\), the function \\(* ^{\\bFm_L}\\) is the map that\nsends each tuple of formulas \\((\\phi_1 , \\ldots ,\\phi_n)\\) (where\n\\(n\\) is the arity of \\(* )\\) to the formula \\(* \\phi_1 \\ldots\n\\phi_n\\), and for every 0-ary connective \\(\\dagger ,\n\\dagger^{\\bFm_L}\\) is \\(\\dagger\\). If no confusion is likely we\nsuppress the subindex in \\(\\bFm_L\\) and write \\(\\bFm\\) instead.  \nAlgebras are a particular type of structure or model. An \\(L\\)-algebra\nis a structure or model for the \\(L\\)-algebraic first-order language.\nTherefore the concepts of model theory for the first-order languages\napply to them (see the entries on\n classical logic\n and\n first-order model theory).\n We need some of these concepts. They are also used in universal\nalgebra, a field that to some extent can be considered the model\ntheory of the algebraic languages. We introduce the definitions of the\nconcepts we need.  \nGiven an algebra \\(\\bA\\) of type \\(L\\), a congruence of\n\\(\\bA\\) is an equivalence relation \\(\\theta\\) on the carrier of\n\\(\\bA\\) that satisfies for every \\(n\\)-ary connective \\(* \\in L\\) the\nfollowing compatibility property: for every \\(a_1 , \\ldots ,a_n, b_1 ,\n\\ldots ,b_n \\in A\\), \nGiven a congruence \\(\\theta\\) of \\(\\bA\\) we can reduce the algebra by\nidentifying the elements which are related by \\(\\theta\\). The algebra\nobtained is the quotient algebra of \\(\\bA\\) modulo\n\\(\\theta\\). It is denoted by \\(\\bA/\\theta\\), its carrier is the set\n\\(A/\\theta\\) of equivalence classes \\([a]\\) of the elements \\(a\\) of\n\\(A\\) modulo the equivalence relation \\(\\theta\\), and the operations\nare defined as follows: \nThe compatibility property ensures that the definition is sound. \nLet \\(\\bA\\) and \\(\\bB\\) be \\(L\\)-algebras. A homomorphism\n\\(h\\) from \\(\\bA\\) to \\(\\bB\\) is a map \\(h\\) from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) such\nthat for every 0-ary symbol \\(\\dagger \\in L\\) and every \\(n\\)-ary\nconnective \\(* \\in L\\) \nWe say that \\(\\bB\\) is a homomorphic image of \\(\\bA\\) if\nthere is a homomorphism from \\(\\bA\\) to \\(\\bB\\) which is an onto map\nfrom \\(A\\) to \\(B\\). An homomorphism from \\(\\bA\\) to \\(\\bB\\) is an\nisomorphism if it is a one-to-one and onto map from \\(A\\) to\n\\(B\\). If an isomorphism from \\(\\bA\\) to \\(\\bB\\) exists, we say that\n\\(\\bA\\) and \\(\\bB\\) are isomorphic and that \\(\\bB\\) is an\nisomorphic image (or a copy) of \\(\\bA\\). \nLet \\(\\bA\\) and \\(\\bB\\) be \\(L\\)-algebras. \\(\\bA\\) is a\nsubalgebra of \\(\\bB\\) if (1) \\(A \\subseteq B\\), (2) the\ninterpretations of the 0-ary symbols of \\(L\\) in \\(\\bB\\) belong to\n\\(A\\) and \\(A\\) is closed under the functions of \\(\\bB\\) that\ninterpret the non 0-ary symbols, and (3) the interpretations of the\n0-ary symbols in \\(\\bA\\) coincide with their interpretations in\n\\(\\bB\\) and the interpretations on \\(\\bA\\) of the other symbols in\n\\(L\\) are the restrictions to \\(\\bA\\) of their interpretations in\n\\(\\bB\\). \nWe refer the reader to the entry on\n first-order model theory\n for the notions of direct product (called product there) and\nultraproduct. \nThe majority of classes of algebras that provide semantics for\npropositional logics are quasivarieties and in most cases varieties.\nThe theory of varieties and quasivarieties is one of the main subjects\nof universal algebra. \nA variety of \\(L\\)-algebras is a class of \\(L\\)-algebras that is\ndefinable in a very simple way (by equations) using the\n\\(L\\)-algebraic language. An \\(L\\)-equation is a formula\n\\(\\phi \\approx \\psi\\) where \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are terms of the\n\\(L\\)-algebraic language (that is, \\(L\\)-formulas if we take the\npropositional logics point of view). An equation \\(\\phi \\approx \\psi\\)\nis valid in an algebra \\(\\bA\\), or \\(\\bA\\) is a\nmodel of \\(\\phi \\approx \\psi\\), if for every valuation \\(v\\)\non \\(\\bA, \\bv(\\phi) = \\bv(\\psi)\\). This is exactly the same as to\nsaying that the universal closure of \\(\\phi \\approx \\psi\\) is a\nsentence true in \\(\\bA\\) according to the usual semantics for\nfirst-order logic with equality. A variety of \\(L\\)-algebras\nis a class of \\(L\\)-algebras which is the class of all the models of a\ngiven set of \\(L\\)-equations. \nQuasivarieties of \\(L\\)-algebras are classes of \\(L\\)-algebras\ndefinable using the \\(L\\)-algebraic language in a slightly more\ncomplex way than in varieties. A proper \\(L\\)-quasiequation\nis a formula of the form \n\n\\[\\bigwedge_{i \\le n} \\phi_i \\approx \\psi_i \\rightarrow \\phi \\approx \\psi.\\]\n\n An \\(L\\)-quasiequation\nis a formula of the above form but possibly with an empty antecedent,\nin which case it is just the equation \\(\\phi \\approx \\psi\\). Hence,\nthe \\(L\\)-quasiequations are the proper \\(L\\)-quasiequations and the\n\\(L\\)-equations. An \\(L\\)-quasiequation is valid in an\n\\(L\\)-algebra \\(\\bA\\), or the algebra is a model of it, if the\nuniversal closure of the quasiequation is sentence true in \\(\\bA\\). A\nquasivariety of \\(L\\)-algebras is a class of algebras which\nis the class of the models of a given set of \\(L\\)-quasiequations.\nSince equations are quasiequations, each variety is a quasivariety.\nThe converse is false.  \nVarieties and quasivarieties can be characterized by the closure\nproperties they enjoy. A class of \\(L\\)-algebras is a variety if and\nonly if it is closed under subalgebras, direct products, and\nhomomorphic images. The variety generated by a class \\(\\bK\\) of\n\\(L\\)-algebras is the least class of \\(L\\)-algebras that includes\n\\(\\bK\\) and is closed under subalgebras, direct products and\nhomomorphic images. It is also the class of the algebras that are\nmodels of the equations valid in \\(\\bK\\). For example, the variety\ngenerated by the algebra of the two truth-values for classical logic\nis the class of Boolean algebras. If we restrict that algebra to the\noperations for conjunction and disjunction only, it generates the\nvariety of distributive lattices and if we restrict it to the\noperations for conjunction and disjunction and the interpretations of\n\\(\\top\\) and \\(\\bot\\), it generates the variety of bounded\ndistributive lattices. \nA class of \\(L\\)-algebras is a quasivariety if and only if it is\nclosed under subalgebras, direct products, ultraproducts, isomorphic\nimages, and contains a trivial algebra. The quasivariety generated by\na class \\(\\bK\\) of \\(L\\)-algebras is the least class of \\(L\\)-algebras\nthat includes \\(\\bK\\), the trivial algebras and is closed under\nsubalgebras, direct products, ultraproducts, and isomorphic images.\n \nAn SP-class of \\(L\\)-algebras is a class of \\(L\\)-algebras\nthat contains a trivial algebra and is closed under isomorphic images,\nsubalgebras, and direct products. Thus quasivarieties and varieties\nare all SP-classes. The SP-class generated by a class \\(\\bK\\) of\n\\(L\\)-algebras is the least class of \\(L\\)-algebras that includes\n\\(\\bK\\), the trivial algebras and is closed under subalgebras, direct\nproducts and isomorphic images.  \nThe term ‘algebraic semantics’ was (and many times still\nis) used in the literature in a loose way. To provide a logic with an\nalgebraic semantics was to interpret its language in a class of\nalgebras, define a notion of satisfaction of a formula (under a\nvaluation) in an algebra of the class and prove a soundness and\ncompleteness theorem, usually for the theorems of the logic only.\nNowadays there is a precise concept of algebraic semantics for a logic\nsystem. It was introduced by Blok and Pigozzi in Blok & Pigozzi\n1989. In this concept we find a general way to state in mathematically\nprecise terms what is common to the many cases of purported algebraic\nsemantics for specific logic systems found in the literature. We\nexpose the notion in this section. To motivate the definition we\ndiscuss several examples first, stressing what is common to all of\nthem. The reader does not need to know about the classes of algebras\nthat provide algebraic semantics we refer to in the examples. Its\nexistence is what is important. \nThe prototypical examples of algebraic semantics for propositional\nlogics are the class BA of\n Boolean algebras,\n which is the algebraic semantics for classical logic, and the class\nHA of Heyting algebras, which is the algebraic\nsemantics for\n intuitionistic logic.\n Every Boolean algebra and every Heyting algebra \\(\\bA\\) has a\ngreatest element according to their natural order; this element is\ndenoted usually by \\(1^{\\bA}\\) and interprets the propositional\nconstant symbol \\(\\top\\). It is taken as the distinguished element\nrelative to which the algebraic semantics is given. The algebraic\nsemantics of these two logics works as follows:  \nLet \\(\\bL\\) be classical or intuitionistic logic and let \\(\\bK(\\bL)\\)\nbe the corresponding class of algebras BA or\nHA. It holds that  \n\\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\txtiff\\) for every \\(\\bA \\in \\bK(\\bL)\\)\nand every valuation \\(v\\) on \\(\\bA\\), if \\(\\bv(\\psi) = 1^{\\bA}\\) for all \\(\\psi \\in \\Gamma \\), then \\(\\bv(\\phi) = 1^{\\bA}\\). \nThis is the precise content of the statement that BA\nand HA are an algebraic semantics for classical logic\nand for intuitionistic logic respectively. The implication from left\nto right in the expression above is an algebraic soundness theorem and\nthe implication from right to left an algebraic completeness\ntheorem. \nThere are logics for which an algebraic semantics is provided in the\nliterature in a slightly different way from the one given by the\nschema above. Let us consider the example in\n Section 3.5\n of Intuitionistic Linear Logic without exponentials. We denote by\n\\(\\bILsubZ\\) the class of IL-algebras with zero defined in Troelstra\n1992 (but adapted to the language of \\(\\bILL)\\). Each \\(\\bA \\in\n\\bILsubZ\\) is a lattice with extra operations and thus has its lattice\norder \\(\\le^{\\bA}\\). This lattice order has a greatest element which\nwe take as the interpretation of \\(\\top\\). On each one of these\nalgebras \\(\\bA\\) there is a designated element \\(1^{\\bA}\\) (the\ninterpretation of 1) that may be different from the greatest element.\nIt holds: \n\\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bILL } \\phi\\txtiff\\) for every \\(\\bA \\in \\bILsubZ\\)\nand every valuation \\(v\\) on \\(\\bA\\), if \\(1^{\\bA } \\le^{\\bA } \\bv(\\psi)\\) for all \\(\\psi \\in \\Gamma \\), then \\(1^{\\bA } \\le^{\\bA }\n\\bv(\\phi)\\). \nIn this case one does not consider only a designated element in every\nalgebra \\(\\bA\\) but a set of designated elements, namely the elements\nof \\(\\bA\\)  greater than or equal to \\(1^{\\bA}\\), to provide the\ndefinition. Let us denote this set by \\(\\tD (\\bA)\\), and notice that\n\\(\\tD (\\bA) = \\{a \\in A: 1^{\\bA } \\wedge^{\\bA} a = 1^{\\bA }\\}\\).\nHence, \n\\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bILL } \\phi\\txtiff\\) for every \\(\\bA \\in \\bILsubZ\\)\nif \\(\\bv[\\Gamma] \\subseteq \\tD (\\bA)\\), then \\(\\bv(\\phi) \\in \\tD\n(\\bA)\\). \nStill there are even more complex situations. One of them is the\nsystem \\(\\bR\\) of relevance logic. Consider the class of algebras\n\\(\\bRal\\) defined in Font & Rodríguez 1990 (see also Font\n& Rodríguez 1994) and denoted there by\n‘\\(\\bR\\)’. Let us consider for every \\(\\bA \\in \\bRal\\) the\nset \n\n\\[\\tE(\\bA) := \\{a \\in A: a \\wedge^{\\bA }(a \\rightarrow^{\\bA } a) = a \\rightarrow^{\\bA } a\\}.\\] \n\n Then \\(\\bRal\\) is said to be an algebraic semantics\nfor \\(\\bR\\) because the following holds: \n\\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bR } \\phi\\txtiff\\) for every \\(\\bA \\in \\bRal\\) and\nevery valuation \\(v\\) on \\(\\bA\\), if \\(\\bv[\\Gamma] \\subseteq \\tE\n(\\bA)\\), then \\(\\bv(\\phi) \\in \\tE (\\bA)\\). \nThe common pattern in the examples above is that the algebraic\nsemantics is given by  \nThe main point in Blok and Pigozzi’s concept of algebraic\nsemantics comes from the realization, mentioned in (3) above, that the\nset of designated elements considered in the algebraic semantics of\nknown logics is in fact the set of solutions of an equation, and that\nwhat practice forced researchers to look for when they tried to obtain\nalgebraic semantics for new logics was in fact, although not\nexplicitly formulated in these terms, an equational way to define\nuniformly in every algebra a set of designated elements in order to\nobtain an algebraic soundness and completeness theorem.  \nWe are now in a position to expose the mathematically precise concept\nof algebraic semantics. To develop a fruitful and general theory of\nthe algebraization of logics some generalizations beyond the\nwell-known concrete examples have to be made. In the definition of\nalgebraic semantics, one takes the move from a single equation to a\nset of them in the definability condition for the set of designated\nelements. \nBefore stating Blok and Pigozzi’s definition we need to\nintroduce a notational convention. Given an algebra \\(\\bA\\) and a set\nof equations \\(\\iEq\\) in one variable, we denote by \\(\\iEq(\\bA)\\) the\nset of elements of \\(\\bA\\) that satisfy all the equations in \\(\\iEq\\).\nThen a logic \\(\\bL\\) is said to have an algebraic semantics\nif there is a class of algebras \\(\\bK\\) and a set of equations\n\\(\\iEq\\) in one variable such that \nIn this situation we say that the class of algebras \\(\\bK\\) is an\n\\(\\iEq\\)-algebraic semantics for \\(\\bL\\), or that the pair\n\\((\\bK, \\iEq)\\) is an algebraic semantics for \\(\\bL\\). If\n\\(\\iEq\\) consists of a single equation \\(\\delta(p) \\approx\n\\varepsilon(p)\\) we will simply say that \\(\\bK\\) is a \\(\\delta(p)\n\\approx \\varepsilon(p)\\)-algebraic semantics for \\(\\bL\\). In fact,\nBlok and Pigozzi required that \\(\\iEq\\) should be finite in their\ndefinition of algebraic semantics. But it is better to be more\ngeneral. The definition clearly encompasses the situations encountered\nin the examples. \nIf \\(\\bK\\) is an \\(\\iEq\\)-algebraic semantics for a finitary logic\n\\(\\bL\\) and \\(\\iEq\\) is finite, then the quasivariety generated by\n\\(\\bK\\) is also an \\(\\iEq\\)-algebraic semantics. The same does not\nhold in general if we consider the generated variety. For this reason\nit is customary and useful when developing the theory of the\nalgebraization of finitary logics to consider quasivarieties of\nalgebras as algebraic semantics instead of arbitrary subclasses that\ngenerate them. Conversely, if a quasivariety is an \\(\\iEq\\)-algebraic\nsemantics for a finitary \\(\\bL\\) and \\(\\iEq\\) is finite, so is any\nsubclass of the quasivariety that generates it.  \nIn the best-behaved cases, the typical algebraic semantics of a logic\nis a variety, for instance in all the examples discussed above. But\nthere are cases in which it is not.  \nA quasivariety can be an \\(\\iEq\\)-algebraic semantics for a logic and\nan \\(\\iEq'\\)-algebraic semantics for another logic (with \\(\\iEq\\) and\n\\(\\iEq'\\) different). For example, due to Glivenko’s theorem\n(see the entry on\n intuitionistic logic)\n the class of Heyting algebras is a \\(\\{\\neg \\neg p \\approx\n1\\}\\)-algebraic semantics for classical logic and it is the standard\n\\(\\{p \\approx 1\\}\\)-algebraic semantics for intuitionistic logic.\nMoreover, different quasivarieties of algebras can be an\n\\(\\iEq\\)-algebraic semantics for the same logic. It is known that\nthere is a quasivariety that properly includes the variety of Boolean\nalgebras and is a \\(\\{p \\approx 1\\}\\)-algebraic semantics for\nclassical propositional logic. It is also known that for some logics\nwith an algebraic semantics (relative to some set of equations), the\nnatural class of algebras that corresponds to the logic is not an\nalgebraic semantics (for any set of equations) of it. One example\nwhere this situation holds is in the local normal modal logic\n\\(\\blK\\). Finally, there are logics that do not have any algebraic\nsemantics. \nThese facts highlight the need for some criteria of the goodness of a\npair \\((\\bK, \\iEq)\\) to provide a natural algebraic semantics for a\nlogic \\(\\bL\\) when some exists. One such criterion would be that\n\\(\\bL\\) is an algebraizable logic with \\((\\bK, \\iEq)\\) as an algebraic\nsemantics. Another that \\(\\bK\\) is the natural class of algebras\nassociated with the logic \\(\\bL\\). The notion of the natural class of\nalgebras of a logic system will be discussed in\n Section 8\n and the concept of algebraizable logic in\n Section 9.\n  \nIn the last section, we saw that to provide a logic with an algebraic\nsemantics we need in many cases to consider in every algebra a set of\ndesignated elements instead of a single designated one. In the\nexamples we discussed, the set of designated elements was definable in\nthe algebras by one equation. This motivated the definition of\nalgebraic semantics in\n Section 5.\n For many logics, to obtain a semantics similar to an algebraic\nsemantics using the class of algebras naturally associated with them\none needs for every algebra a set of designated elements that cannot\nbe defined using only the equations of the algebraic language or is\nnot even definable by using this language only. As we already\nmentioned, one example where this happens is the local consequence of\nthe normal modal logic \\(K\\). \nTo endow every logic with a semantics of an algebraic kind\none has to consider, at least, algebras together with a set of\ndesignated elements, without any requirement about its definability\nusing the corresponding algebraic language. These pairs are the\nlogical matrices. Tarski defined the general concept of logical matrix\nin the 1920s but the concept was already implicit in previous work by\nŁukasiewicz, Bernays, Post and others, who used truth-tables,\neither in independence proofs or to define logics different from\nclassical logic. A logical matrix is a pair \\(\\langle \\bA, D\n\\rangle\\) where \\(\\bA\\) is an algebra and \\(D\\) a subset of the\ncarrier \\(A\\) of \\(\\bA\\); the elements of \\(D\\) are called the\ndesignated elements of the matrix and accordingly \\(D\\) is\ncalled the set of designated elements (sometimes it is also\ncalled the truth set of the matrix). Logical matrices were\nfirst used as models of the theorems of specific logic systems, for\ninstance in the work of McKinsey and Tarski, and also to define sets\nof formulas with similar properties to those of the set of theorems of\na logic system, namely closure under substitution instances. This was\nthe case of the \\(n\\)-valued logics of Łukasiewicz and of his\ninfinite-valued logic. It was Tarski who first considered logical\nmatrices as a general tool to define this kind of sets.  \nThe general theory of logical matrices explained in this entry is due\nmainly to Polish logicians, starting with Łoś 1949 and\ncontinuing in Łoś & Suszko 1958, building on previous\nwork by Lindenbaum. In Łoś and Suszko’s paper matrices\nare used for the first time both as models of logic systems (in our\nsense) and to define these kinds of systems.  \nIn the rest of this section, we present the relevant concepts of the\ntheory of logical matrices using modern terminology. \nGiven a logic \\(\\bL\\), a logical matrix \\(\\langle \\bA, D \\rangle\\) is\nsaid to be a model of \\(\\bL\\) if wherever \\(\\Gamma\n\\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\) then every valuation \\(v\\) on \\(\\bA\\) that maps\nthe elements of \\(\\Gamma\\) to some designated value (i.e., an element\nof \\(D)\\) also maps \\(\\phi\\) to a designated value. When \\(\\langle\n\\bA, D \\rangle\\) is a model of \\(\\bL\\) it is said that \\(D\\) is an\n\\(\\bL\\)-filter of the algebra \\(\\bA\\). The set of\n\\(\\bL\\)-filters of an algebra \\(\\bA\\) plays a crucial role in the\ntheory of the algebraization of logic systems. We will come to this\npoint later.  \nA class \\(\\bM\\) of logical matrices is said to be a matrix\nsemantics for a logic \\(\\bL\\) if  \nThe implication from left to right says that \\(\\bL\\) is sound relative\nto \\(\\bM\\), and the other implication says that it is complete. In\nother words, \\(\\bM\\) is a matrix semantics for \\(\\bL\\) if and only if\nevery matrix in \\(\\bM\\) is a model of \\(\\bL\\) and moreover for every\n\\(\\Gamma\\) and \\(\\phi\\) such that \\(\\Gamma \\not\\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\)\nthere is a model \\(\\langle \\bA, \\tD \\rangle\\) of \\(\\bL\\) in \\(\\bM\\)\nthat witnesses the fact, namely there is a valuation on the model that\nsends the formulas in \\(\\Gamma\\) to designated elements and \\(\\phi\\)\nto a non-designated one.  \nLogical matrices are also used to define logics semantically. If \\(\\cM\n= \\langle \\bA, D \\rangle\\) is a logical matrix, the relation defined\nby \n\\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\cM } \\phi\\txtiff\\) for every valuation \\(v\\) on\n\\(\\bA\\) if \\(\\bv(\\psi) \\in D\\) for all \\(\\psi \\in \\Gamma\\), then\n\\(\\bv(\\phi) \\in D\\) \nis a consequence relation which is substitution-invariant; therefore\n\\(\\langle L, \\vdash_{\\cM } \\rangle\\) is a logic system. Similarly, we\ncan define the logic of a class of matrices \\(\\bM\\) by taking\ncondition (*) as a definition of a consequence relation. In the entry\non\n many-valued logic\n the reader can find several logics defined in this way.  \nEvery logic (independently of how it is defined) has a matrix\nsemantics. Moreover, every logic has a matrix semantics whose elements\nhave the property of being reduced in the following sense: A matrix\n\\(\\langle \\bA, D \\rangle\\) is reduced if there are no two\ndifferent elements of \\(A\\) that behave in the same way. We say that\n\\(a, b \\in A\\) behave in the same way in \\(\\langle \\bA, D\n\\rangle\\) if for every formula \\(\\phi (q, p_1 , \\ldots ,p_n)\\) and all\nelements \\(d_1 , \\ldots ,d_n \\in A\\) \n\n\\[\\phi^{\\bA }[a, d_1 , \\ldots ,d_n] \\in D \\txtiff  \\phi^{\\bA }[b, d_1 , \\ldots ,d_n] \\in D.\\]\n\n Thus \\(a, b \\in A\\)\nbehave differently if there is a formula \\(\\phi(q, p_1 , \\ldots\n,p_n)\\) and elements \\(d_1 , \\ldots ,d_n \\in A\\) such that one of\n\\(\\phi^{\\bA }[a, d_1 , \\ldots ,d_n]\\) and \\(\\phi^{\\bA }[b, d_1 ,\n\\ldots ,d_n]\\) belongs to \\(D\\) but not both. The relation of behaving\nin the same way in \\(\\langle \\bA, D \\rangle\\) is a congruence relation\nof \\(\\bA\\). This relation is known after Blok & Pigozzi 1986, 1989\nas the Leibniz congruence of the matrix \\(\\langle \\bA, D\n\\rangle\\) and is denoted by \\(\\bOmega_{\\bA }(D)\\). It can be\ncharacterized as the greatest congruence relation of \\(\\bA\\) that is\ncompatible with \\(D\\), that is, that does not relate elements\nin \\(D\\) with elements not in \\(D\\). The concept of Leibniz congruence\nplays a fundamental role in the general theory of the algebraization\nof the logic systems developed during the 1980s by Blok and Pigozzi.\nThe reader is referred to Font, Jansana, & Pigozzi 2003 and\nCzelakowski 2001 for extensive information on the developments around\nthe concept of Leibniz congruence during this period.  \nEvery matrix \\(\\cM\\) can be turned into a reduced matrix by\nidentifying the elements related by its Leibniz congruence. This\nmatrix is called the reduction of \\(\\cM\\) and is usually\ndenoted by \\(\\cM^*\\). A matrix and its reduction are models of the\nsame logic systems, and since reduced matrices have no redundant\nelements, the classes of reduced matrices that are matrix semantics\nfor logic systems are usually taken as the classes of matrices that\ndeserve study; they are better suited to encoding in algebraic-like\nterms the properties of the logics that have them as their matrix\nsemantics.  \nThe proof that every logic system has a reduced matrix semantics\n(i.e., a matrix semantics consisting of reduced matrices) is as\nfollows. Let \\(\\bL\\) be a logic system. Consider the matrices\n\\(\\langle \\bFm_L, T \\rangle\\) over the formula algebra, where \\(T\\) is\na theory of \\(\\bL\\). These matrices are known as the Lindenbaum\nmatrices of \\(\\bL\\). It is not difficult to see that the class of\nthose matrices is a matrix semantics for \\(\\bL\\). Since a matrix and\nits reduction are models of the same logics, the reductions of the\nLindenbaum matrices of \\(\\bL\\) constitute a matrix semantics for\n\\(\\bL\\) too, and indeed a reduced one. Moreover, any class of reduced\nmatrix models of \\(\\bL\\) that includes the reduced Lindenbaum matrices\nof \\(\\bL\\) is automatically a complete matrix semantics for \\(\\bL\\).\nIn particular, the class of all reduced matrix models of \\(\\bL\\) is a\ncomplete matrix semantics for \\(\\bL\\). We denote this class by\n\\(\\bRMatr(\\bL)\\). \nThe above proof can be seen as a generalization of the\nLindenbaum-Tarski method for proving algebraic completeness theorems\nthat we will discuss in the next section. \nThe class of the algebras of the matrices in \\(\\bRMatr(\\bL)\\) plays a\nprominent role in the theory of the algebraization of logics and it is\ndenoted by \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\). It has been considered for a long time the\nnatural class of algebras that has to be associated with a given logic\n\\(\\bL\\) as its algebraic counterpart. For instance, in the examples\nconsidered above, the classes of algebras that were given as algebraic\nsemantics of the different logics (Boolean algebras, Heyting algebras,\netc.) are exactly the class \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) of the corresponding logic\n\\(\\bL\\). And in fact the class \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) coincides with what was\ntaken to be the natural class of algebras for all the logics \\(\\bL\\)\nstudied up to the 1990s. In the 1990s, due to the knowledge acquired\nof several logics not studied before, some authors proposed another\nway to define the class of algebras that has to be counted as the\nalgebraic counterpart to be associated with a given logic \\(\\bL\\). For\nmany logics \\(\\bL\\) it leads exactly to the class \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) but\nfor others it gives a class that extends it properly. We will see it\nin\n Section 8. \nWe now discuss the method that is most commonly used to prove that a\nclass of algebras \\(\\bK\\) is a \\(\\delta(p) \\approx\n\\varepsilon(p)\\)-algebraic semantics for a logic \\(\\bL\\), namely the\nLindenbaum-Tarski method. It is the standard method used to prove that\nthe classes of algebras of the examples mentioned in\n Section 5\n are algebraic semantics for the corresponding logics. \nThe Lindenbaum-Tarski method contributed in two respects to the\nelaboration of important notions in the theory of the algebraization\nof logics. It underlies Blok and Pigozzi’s notion of\nalgebraizable logic and reflecting on it some ways to define for each\nlogic a class of algebras can be justified as providing a natural\nclass. We will consider this issue in\n Section 8. \nThe Lindenbaum-Tarski method can be outlined as follows. To prove that\na class of algebras \\(\\bK\\) is a \\(\\delta(p) \\approx\n\\varepsilon(p)\\)-algebraic semantics for a logic \\(\\bL\\) first it is\nshown that \\(\\bK\\) gives a sound \\(\\delta(p) \\approx\n\\varepsilon(p)\\)-semantics for \\(\\bL\\), namely that if \\(\\Gamma\n\\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\), then for every \\(\\bA \\in \\bK\\) and every\nvaluation \\(v\\) in \\(\\bA\\) if the values of the formulas in \\(\\Gamma\\)\nsatisfy \\(\\delta(p) \\approx \\varepsilon(p)\\), then the value of\n\\(\\phi\\) does too. Secondly, the other direction, that is, the\ncompleteness part, is proved by what is properly known as the\nLindenbaum-Tarski method. This method uses the theories of \\(\\bL\\) to\nobtain matrices on the algebra of formulas and then reduces these\nmatrices in order to get for each one, a matrix whose algebra is in\n\\(\\bK\\) and whose set of designated elements is the set of elements of\nthe algebra that satisfy \\(\\delta(p) \\approx \\varepsilon(p)\\). We\nproceed to describe the method step by step.  \nLet \\(\\bL\\) be one of the logics discussed in the examples in\n Section 5.\n Let \\(\\bK\\) be the corresponding class of algebras we considered\nthere and let \\(\\delta(p) \\approx \\varepsilon(p)\\) be the equation in\none variable involved in the soundness and completeness theorem. To\nprove the completeness theorem one proceeds as follows. Given any set\nof formulas \\(\\Gamma\\): \nThe proof of the completeness theorem then goes as follows.\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n imply that for every formula \\(\\psi , \\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\psi\\) if\nand only if \\([\\psi]\\) satisfies the equation \\(\\delta(p) \\approx\n\\varepsilon(p)\\) in the algebra \\(\\bFm/\\theta(T)\\). Thus, considering\nthe valuation \\(id\\) mapping every variable \\(p\\) to its equivalence\nclass \\([p]\\), and whose extension \\(\\boldsymbol{id}\\) to the set of\nall formulas is such that \\(\\boldsymbol{id}(\\phi) = [\\phi]\\) for every\nformula \\(\\phi\\), we have for every formula \\(\\psi\\), \n\\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\psi\\txtiff\\boldsymbol{id}(\\psi)\\) satisfies\nthe equation \\(\\delta(p) \\approx \\varepsilon(p)\\) in\n\\(\\bFm/\\theta(T)\\). \nHence, since by\n (5)\n \\(\\bFm/\\theta(T) \\in \\bK\\), it follows that if \\(\\Gamma\n\\not\\vdash_{\\bL }\\phi\\), then there is an algebra \\(\\bA\\) (namely\n\\(\\bFm/\\theta(T))\\) and a valuation \\(v\\) (namely \\(id)\\) such that\nthe elements of \\(\\bv[\\Gamma]\\) satisfy the equation on \\(\\bA\\) but\n\\(\\bv(\\phi)\\) does not. \nThe Lindenbaum-Tarski method, when successful, shows that the class of\nalgebras \\(\\{\\bFm/\\theta(T): T\\) is a theory of \\(\\bL\\}\\) is a\n\\(\\delta(p) \\approx \\varepsilon(p)\\)-algebraic semantics for \\(\\bL\\).\nTherefore it also shows that every class of algebras \\(\\bK\\) which is\n\\(\\delta(p) \\approx \\varepsilon(p)\\)-sound for \\(\\bL\\) and includes\n\\(\\{\\bFm/\\theta(T): T\\) is a theory of \\(\\bL\\}\\) is also a \\(\\delta(p)\n\\approx \\varepsilon(p)\\)-algebraic semantics for \\(\\bL\\). \nLet us make some remarks on the Lindenbaum-Tarski method just\ndescribed. The first is important for the generalizations leading to\nthe classes of algebras associated with a logic. The other to obtain\nthe conditions in the definition of the concept of algebraizable\nlogic. \nThe concept of algebraizable logic introduced by Blok and Pigozzi,\nwhich we will discuss in\n Section 9,\n can be described roughly by saying that a logic \\(\\bL\\) is\nalgebraizable if it has an algebraic semantics \\((\\bK, \\iEq)\\) such\nthat (1) \\(\\bK\\) is included in the natural class of algebras\n\\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) associated with \\(\\bL\\) and (2) the fact that \\((\\bK,\n\\iEq)\\) is an algebraic semantics can be proved by using the\nLindenbaum-Tarski method slightly generalized.  \nWe shall now discuss the two definitions that have been considered as\nproviding natural classes of algebras associated with a logic \\(\\bL\\).\nBoth definitions can be seen as arising from an abstraction of the\nLindenbaum-Tarski method and we follow this path in introducing them.\nThe common feature of these abstractions is that in them the specific\nway in which the relation \\(\\theta(T)\\) is defined in the\nLindenbaum-Tarski method is disregarded.  \nIt has to be remarked that, nonetheless, for many logics both\ndefinitions lead to the same class. But the classes obtained from both\ndefinitions have been considered in the algebraic studies of many\nparticular logics (for some logics one, for others the other) the\nnatural class that deserves to be studied.  \nWe already encountered the first generalization in\n Section 6\n when we showed that every logic has a reduced matrix semantics. It\nleads to the class of algebras \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\); that its definition is\na generalization of the Lindenbaum-Tarski method comes from the\nrealization that the relation \\(\\theta(T)\\), associated with an \\(\\bL\\)-theory, defined in the different\ncompleteness proofs in the literature that use the Lindenbaum-Tarski\nmethod is in fact the Leibniz congruence of the matrix \\(\\langle\n\\bFm_L, T \\rangle\\) and that therefore the matrix \\(\\langle\n\\bFm/\\theta(T), T/\\theta(T) \\rangle\\) is its reduction. As we\nmentioned in\n Section 6,\n for every logic \\(\\bL\\) every \\(\\bL\\)-sound class of matrices \\(\\bM\\)\nthat contains all the matrices \\(\\langle \\bFm/\\bOmega_{\\bFm_L }(T), T/\n\\bOmega_{\\bFm_L }(T) \\rangle\\), where \\(T\\) is a theory of \\(\\bL\\), is\na complete reduced matrix semantics for \\(\\bL\\). From this perspective\nthe notion of the Leibniz congruence of a matrix can be taken as a\ngeneralization to arbitrary matrices of the idea that comes from the\nLindenbaum-Tarski procedure of proving completeness. Following this\ncourse of reasoning the class \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) of the algebras of the\nreduced matrix models of a logic \\(\\bL\\) is the natural class of\nalgebras to associate with \\(\\bL\\). It is the class \n\\(\\{\\bA/\\bOmega_{\\bA }(F): \\bA\\) is an \\(\\bL\\)-algebra and \\(F\\) is a\n\\(\\bL\\)-filter of \\(\\bA\\}\\). \nThe second way of generalizing the Lindenbaum-Tarski method uses\nanother fact, namely that in the examples discussed in\n Section 3\n the relation \\(\\theta(T)\\) is also the relation\n\\(\\Omega^{\\sim}_{\\bFm_L }(T)\\) defined by the condition  \nFor every logic \\(\\bL\\) and every \\(\\bL\\)-theory \\(T\\) the relation\n\\(\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bFm_L }(T)\\) defined in this way is the greatest\ncongruence compatible with all the \\(\\bL\\)-theories that extend \\(T\\).\nTherefore it holds that \n\n\\[\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bFm_L }(T) = \\bigcap_{T' \\in \\tTH(\\bL)^T} \\bOmega_{\\bFm_L }(T')\\]\n\n where \\(\\tTH(\\bL)^T = \\{T' \\in\n\\tTH(\\bL): T \\subseteq T'\\}\\). The relation \\(\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bFm_L\n}(T)\\) is known as the Suszko congruence of \\(T\\) (w.r.t.\n\\(\\bL)\\). Suszko defined it—in an equivalent way—in\n1977. \nFor every logic \\(\\bL\\), the notion of the Suszko congruence can be\nextended to its matrix models. The Suszko congruence of a\nmatrix model \\(\\langle \\bA, D \\rangle\\) of \\(\\bL\\) (w.r.t. \\(\\bL)\\) is\nthe greatest congruence of \\(\\bA\\) compatible with every\n\\(\\bL\\)-filter of \\(\\bA\\) that includes \\(D\\), that is, it is the\nrelation given by \n\n\\[{\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bA}}^{\\bL}(D)  = \\bigcap_{D' \\in \\tFi_{\\bL}(\\bA)^D} \\bOmega_{\\bA}(D')\\]\n\n where \\(\\tFi_{\\bL}(\\bA)^D = \\{D': D'\\)\nis a \\(\\bL\\)-filter of \\(\\bA\\) and \\(D \\subseteq D'\\}\\). Notice that\nunlike the intrinsic notion of Leibniz congruence, the Suszko\ncongruence of a matrix model of \\(\\bL\\) is not intrinsic to the\nmatrix: it depends in an essential way on the logic under\nconsideration. The theory of the Suszko congruence of matrices has\nbeen developed in Czelakowski 2003 and recently in Albuquerque &\nFont & Jansana 2016.  \nIn the same manner that the concept of Leibniz congruence leads to the\nconcept of reduced matrix, the notion of Suszko congruence leads to\nthe notion of Suszko-reduced matrix. A matrix model of \\(\\bL\\) is\nSuszko-reduced if its Suszko congruence is the identity. Then\nthe class of algebras of the Suszko-reduced matrix models of a logic\n\\(\\bL\\) is another class of algebras that is taken as a natural class\nof algebras to associate with \\(\\bL\\). It is the class of algebras\n \n\\(\\bAlg\\bL = \\{\\bA / {\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bA}}^{\\bL}(F): \\bA\\) is an\n\\(\\bL\\)-algebra and \\(F\\) is a \\(\\bL\\)-filter of \\(\\bA\\}\\). \nThis class of algebras is nowadays taken in abstract algebraic logic\nas the natural class to be associated with \\(\\bL\\) and it\ncalled its algebraic counterpart. \nFor an arbitrary logic \\(\\bL\\) the relation between the classes\n\\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) and \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) is that \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) is the closure of\n\\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) under subdirect products, in particular \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\n\\subseteq \\bAlg\\bL\\). In general, both classes may be different. For\nexample, if \\(\\bL\\) is the \\((\\wedge , \\vee)\\)-fragment of classical\npropositional logic, \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) is the variety of distributive\nlattices (the class that has been always taken to be the natural class\nof algebras associated with \\(\\bL)\\) while \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) is not this\nclass—in fact it is not  a quasivariety. Nonetheless, for\nmany logics \\(\\bL\\), in particular for the algebraizable and the\nprotoalgebraic ones to be discussed in the next sections, and also\nwhen \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) is a variety, the classes \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) and\n\\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) are equal. This fact can explain why in the 1980s,\nbefore the algebraic study of non-protoalgebraic logics was considered\nworth pursuing, the conceptual difference between both definitions of\nthe natural class of algebras of a logic was not needed and\naccordingly it was not considered (or even discovered).  \nThe algebraizable logics are purported to be the logics with the\nstrongest possible link with their algebraic counterpart. This\nrequirement demands that the algebraic counterpart of the logic should\nbe an algebraic semantics but requires a more robust connection\nbetween the logic and the algebraic counterpart than that. This more\nrobust connection is present in the best behaved particular logics\nknown. The mathematically precise concept of algebraizable logic\ncharacterizes this type of link. Blok and Pigozzi introduced that\nfundamental concept in Blok & Pigozzi 1989 and its introduction\ncan be considered the starting point of the unification and growth of\nthe field of abstract algebraic logic in the 1980s. Blok and Pigozzi\ndefined the notion of algebraizable logic only for finitary logics.\nLater Czelakowski and Herrmann generalized it to arbitrary logics and\nalso weakened some conditions in the definition. We present here the\ngeneralized concept.  \nWe said in\n Section 7\n that, roughly speaking, a logic \\(\\bL\\) is algebraizable when 1) it\nhas an algebraic semantics, i.e., a class of algebras \\(\\bK\\) and a\nset of equations \\(\\iEq(p)\\) such that \\(\\bK\\) is a \\(\\iEq\\)-algebraic\nsemantics for \\(\\bL, 2)\\) this fact can be proved by using the\nLindenbaum-Tarski method slightly generalized and, moreover, 3) \\(\\bK\n\\subseteq \\bAlg^*\\bL\\). The generalization of the Lindenbaum-Tarski\nmethod (as we described it in\n Section 7)\n consists in allowing in step (5) (as already done in the definition of algebraic\nsemantics) a set of equations \\(\\iEq(p)\\) in one variable instead of a\nsingle equation \\(\\delta(p) \\approx \\varepsilon(p)\\) and in allowing\nin a similar manner a set of formulas \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) in at most two\nvariables to play the role of the formula \\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\) in\nthe definition of the congruence of a theory. Then, given a theory\n\\(T\\), the relation \\(\\theta(T)\\), which has to be the greatest\ncongruence on the formula algebra compatible with \\(T\\) (i.e., the\nLeibniz congruence of \\(T)\\), is defined by \nWe need some notational conventions before engaging in the precise\ndefinition of algebraizable logic. Given a set of equations\n\\(\\iEq(p)\\) in one variable and a formula \\(\\phi\\), let \\(\\iEq(\\phi)\\)\nbe the set of equations obtained by replacing in all the equations in\n\\(\\iEq\\) the variable \\(p\\) by \\(\\phi\\). If \\(\\Gamma\\) is a set of\nformulas, let \nSimilarly, given a set of formulas in two variables \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\)\nand an equation \\(\\delta \\approx \\varepsilon\\), let \\(\\Delta(\\delta ,\n\\varepsilon)\\) denote the set of formulas obtained by replacing \\(p\\)\nby \\(\\delta\\) and \\(q\\) by \\(\\varepsilon\\) in all the formulas in\n\\(\\Delta\\). Moreover, if \\(\\iEq\\) is a set of equations, let \nGiven a set of equations \\(\\iEq(p, q)\\) in two variables, this set\ndefines on every algebra \\(\\bA\\) a binary relation, namely the set of\npairs \\(\\langle a, b\\rangle\\) of elements of \\(A\\) that satisfy in\n\\(\\bA\\) all the equations in \\(\\iEq(p, q)\\). In standard\nmodel-theoretic notation, this set is the relation \nThe formal definition of algebraizable logic is as follows. A logic\n\\(\\bL\\) is algebraizable if there is a class of algebras\n\\(\\bK\\), a set of equations \\(\\iEq(p)\\) in one variable and a set of\nformulas \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) in two variables such that \n\\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\txtiff\\) for every \\(\\bA \\in \\bK\\) and\nevery valuation \\(v\\) on \\(\\bA\\), if \\(\\bv[\\Gamma] \\subseteq\n\\tEq(\\bA)\\), then \\(\\bv(\\phi) \\in \\tEq(\\bA)\\). \nA class of algebras \\(\\bK\\) for which there are sets \\(\\iEq(p)\\) and\n\\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) with these two properties is said to be an\nequivalent algebraic semantics for \\(\\bL\\). The set of\nformulas \\(\\Delta\\) is called a set of equivalence formulas\nand the set of equations \\(\\iEq\\) a set of defining\nequations. \nThe conditions of the definition imply: \nBlok and Pigozzi’s definition of algebraizable logic in Blok\n& Pigozzi 1989 was given only for finitary logics and, moreover,\nthey imposed that the sets of defining equations and of equivalence\nformulas should be finite. Today we say that an algebraizable logic is\nfinitely algebraizable if the sets of equivalence formulas\n\\(\\Delta\\) and of defining equations \\(\\iEq\\) can both be taken\nfinite. And we say that a logic is Blok-Pigozzi algebraizable\n(BP-algebraizable) if it is finitary and finitely algebraizable.  \nIf \\(\\bL\\) is finitary and finitely algebraizable, then \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\)\nis not only an SP-class, but a quasivariety and it is the quasivariety\ngenerated by any class of algebras \\(\\bK\\) which is an equivalent\nalgebraic semantics for \\(\\bL\\). \nWe have just seen that in algebraizable logics the class of algebras\n\\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) plays a prominent role. Moreover, in these logics the\nclasses of algebras obtained by the two ways of generalizing the\nLindenbaum-Tarski method coincide, that is, \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL =\n\\bAlg\\bL\\)—this is due to the fact that for any algebraizable\nlogic \\(\\bL, \\bAlg^*\\bL\\) is closed under subdirect products. Hence\nfor every algebraizable logic \\(\\bL\\) its algebraic counterpart\n\\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) is its greatest equivalent algebraic semantics, whatever\nperspective is taken on the generalization of the Lindenbaum-Tarski\nmethod. \nConditions\n (1)\n and\n (2)\n of the definition of algebraizable logic (instantiated to \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\)) encode the fact that there\nis a very strong link between an algebraizable logic \\(\\bL\\) and its\nclass of algebras \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\), so that this class of algebras\nreflects the metalogical properties of \\(\\bL\\) by algebraic properties\nof \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) and conversely. \nThe definition of algebraizable logic can be stated in terms of\ntranslations between the logic and an equational consequence relation\n\\(\\vDash_{\\bK}\\) associated with any equivalent algebraic semantics\n\\(\\bK\\) for it—which is the same relation no matter what equivalent\nalgebraic semantics we choose. \nThe equational consequence \\(\\vDash_{\\bK}\\) of a class of algebras\n\\(\\bK\\) is defined as follows.  \n\\(\\{\\phi_i \\approx \\psi_i: i \\in I\\} \\vDash_{\\bK } \\phi \\approx\n\\psi\\txtiff\\) for every \\(\\bA \\in \\bK\\) and every valuation \\(v\\) on\n\\(\\bA\\), if \\(\\bv(\\phi_i) = \\bv(\\psi_i)\\), for all \\(i \\in I\\), then\n\\(\\bv(\\phi) = \\bv(\\psi)\\). \nThe translations needed are given by the set of defining equations and\nthe set of equivalence formulas. A set of equations \\(\\iEq(p)\\) in one\nvariable defines a translation from formulas to sets of\nequations: each formula is translated into the set of equations\n\\(\\iEq(\\phi)\\). Similarly, a set of formulas \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) in two\nvariables defines a translation from equations to sets of\nformulas: each equation \\(\\phi \\approx \\psi\\) is translated into\nthe set of formulas \\(\\Delta(\\phi , \\psi)\\).  \nCondition\n (1)\n in the definition of algebraizable logic can be reformulated as\n\n\\[\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\txtiff \\iEq(\\Gamma) \\vDash_{\\bK } \\iEq(\\phi)\\]\n\n and condition\n (2)\n as \n\n\\[p \\approx q \\vDash_{\\bK } \\iEq(\\Delta(p, q)) \\textrm{ and }  \\iEq(\\Delta(p, q)) \\vDash_{\\bK } p \\approx q.\\] \nThese two conditions imply \nand condition\n (3)\n above is \nThus an algebraizable logic \\(\\bL\\) is faithfully interpreted in the\nequational logic of its equivalent algebraic semantics (condition\n (2))\n by means of the translation of formulas into sets of equations given\nby a set of defining equations, and the equational logic of its\nequivalent algebraic semantics is faithfully interpreted in the logic\n\\(\\bL\\) (condition\n (9))\n by means of the translation of equations into sets of formulas given\nby an equivalence set of formulas. Moreover, both translations are\ninverses of each other (conditions\n (2)\n and\n (3))\n modulo logical equivalence. In this way we see that the link between\n\\(\\bL\\) and its greatest equivalent algebraic semantics is really very\nstrong and that the properties of \\(\\bL\\) should translate into\nproperties of the associated equational consequence relation. The\nproperties that this relation actually has depend on the properties of\nthe class of algebras \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\). \nGiven an algebraic semantics \\((\\bK, \\iEq)\\) for a logic \\(\\bL\\), a\nway to stress the difference between it being merely an algebraic\nsemantics and being an algebraic semantics that makes \\(\\bL\\)\nalgebraizable is that the translation of formulas into equations given\nby the set of equations \\(\\iEq\\) is invertible in the sense that there\nis a translation, say \\(\\Delta\\), of equations into formulas given by\na set of formulas in two variables that satisfies condition\n (9)\n above, and such that \\(\\iEq\\) and \\(\\Delta\\) provide mutually\ninverses translations (i.e., conditions\n (2)\n and\n (3)\n hold).  \nThe link between an algebraizable logic \\(\\bL\\) and its greatest\nequivalent algebraic semantics given by the set of defining equations\nand the set of equivalence formulas allows us to prove a series of\ngeneral theorems that relate the properties of \\(\\bL\\) with the\nproperties of \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\). We will mention as a sample only three of\nthem. \nThe first concerns the deduction theorem. To prove a general theorem\nrelating the existence of a deduction theorem with an algebraic\nproperty requires first that a concept of deduction theorem applicable\nto any logic has to be defined. A logic \\(\\bL\\) has the\ndeduction-detachment property if there is a finite set of\nformulas \\(\\Sigma(p, q)\\) such that for every set of formulas\n\\(\\Gamma\\) and all formulas \\(\\phi , \\psi\\) \nNote that this is a generalization of the standard deduction theorem\n(the direction from left to right in the above expression) and Modus\nPonens (equivalent to the implication from right to left) that several\nlogics have for a connective \\(\\rightarrow\\). In those cases\n\\(\\Sigma(p, q) = \\{p \\rightarrow q\\}\\).  \nTheorem 1.\nA finitary and finitely algebraizable logic \\(\\bL\\) has the\ndeduction-detachment property if and only if the principal relative\ncongruences of the algebras in \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) are equationally\ndefinable. \nThe second theorem refers to Craig interpolation. Several notions of\ninterpolation are applicable to arbitrary logics. We consider only one\nof them. A logic \\(\\bL\\) has the Craig interpolation property\nfor the consequence relation if whenever \\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\)\nthere is a finite set of formulas \\(\\Gamma\\)’ with variables\nshared by \\(\\phi\\) and the formulas in \\(\\Gamma\\) such that \\(\\Gamma\n\\vdash_{\\bL } \\Gamma '\\) and \\(\\Gamma ' \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\). \nTheorem 2.\nLet \\(\\bL\\) be a finitary and finitely algebraizable logic with\nthe deduction-detachment property. Then \\(\\bL\\) has the Craig\ninterpolation property if and only if \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) has the\namalgamation property.  \nFinally, the third theorem concerns the Beth definability property.\nThe interested reader can find the definition in Font, Jansana &\nPigozzi 2003. It is too involved in the general setting we are in to\ngive it here.  \nTheorem 3.\nA finitary and finitely algebraizable logic has the Beth property\nif and only if all the epimorphisms of the category with objects the\nalgebras in \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) and morphisms the algebraic homomorphisms are\nsurjective homomorphisms. \nOther results relating properties of an algebraizable logic with a\nproperty of its natural class of algebras can be found in Raftery\n2011, 2013. They concern respectively a generalization of the property\nof having the deduction-detachment property and the property that\ngeneralize the inconsistency lemmas of classical and intuitionistic\nlogic. Also an abstract notion of having a theorem like\nGlivenko’s theorem relating classical and intuitionistic logic\nhas been proposed and related to an algebraic property in the case of\nalgebraizable logics in Torrens 2008.  \nFor several classes of algebras that are the equivalent algebraic\nsemantics of some algebraizable logic it has been known for a long\ntime that for every algebra in the class there is an isomorphism\nbetween the lattice of congruences of the algebra and a lattice of\nsubsets of the algebra with important algebraic meaning. For example,\nin Boolean algebras and Heyting algebras these subsets are the lattice\nfilters and in modal algebras they are the lattice filters that are\nclosed under the operation that interprets \\(\\Box\\). In all those\ncases, the sets are exactly the \\(\\bL\\)-filters of the corresponding\nalgebraizable logic \\(\\bL\\). \nAlgebraizable logics can be characterized by the existence of this\nkind of isomorphism between congruences and logic filters on the\nalgebras of their algebraic counterpart. To spell out this\ncharacterization we need a couple of definitions. Let \\(\\bL\\) be a\nlogic. The Leibniz operator on an algebra \\(\\bA\\) (relative\nto \\(\\bL)\\) is the map from the \\(\\bL\\)-filters of \\(\\bA\\) to the set\nof congruences of \\(\\bA\\) that sends every \\(\\bL\\)-filter \\(D\\) of\n\\(\\bA\\) to its Leibniz congruence \\(\\bOmega_{\\bA }(D)\\). We say that\nthe Leibniz operator of a logic \\(\\bL\\) commutes with the inverses\nof homomorphisms between algebras in a class \\(\\bK\\) if for every\nhomomorphism \\(h\\) from an algebra \\(\\bA \\in \\bK\\) to an algebra \\(\\bB\n\\in \\bK\\) and every \\(\\bL\\)-filter \\(D\\) of \\(\\bB, h^{-1}[\\bOmega_{\\bB\n}(D)] = \\bOmega_{\\bA }(h^{-1}[D]\\)). \nTheorem 4.\nA logic \\(\\bL\\) is algebraizable if and only if for every algebra\n\\(\\bA \\in \\bAlg\\bL\\) the Leibniz operator commutes with the inverses\nof homomorphisms between algebras in \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) and is an isomorphism\nbetween the set of all \\(\\bL\\)-filters of \\(\\bA\\), ordered by\ninclusion, and the set of congruences \\(\\theta\\) of \\(\\bA\\) such that\n\\(\\bA/\\theta \\in \\bAlg\\bL\\), ordered also by inclusion. \nThe theorem provides a logical explanation of the known isomorphisms\nmentioned above and similar ones for other classes of algebras. For\nexample the isomorphism between the congruences and the normal\nsubgroups of a group can be explained by the existence of an\nalgebraizable logic \\(\\bL\\) of which the class of groups is its\ngreatest equivalent algebraic semantics and the normal subgroups of a\ngroup are its \\(\\bL\\)-filters. \nA different but related characterization of algebraizable logics is\nthis: \nTheorem 5.\nA logic \\(\\bL\\) is algebraizable if and only if on the algebra of\nformulas \\(\\bFm_L\\), the map that sends every theory \\(T\\) to its\nLeibniz congruence  commutes with the inverses\nof homomorphisms from \\(\\bFm_L\\) to \\(\\bFm_L\\) and is  an isomorphismbetween the set\n\\(\\tTH(\\bL)\\) of theories of \\(\\bL\\), ordered by inclusion, and the\nset of congruences \\(\\theta\\) of \\(\\bFm_L\\) such that \\(\\bFm_L /\\theta\n\\in \\bAlg\\bL\\), also ordered by inclusion. \nUnfortunately not every logic is algebraizable. A typical example of a\nnon-algebraizable logic is the local consequence of the normal modal\nlogic \\(K\\). Let us discuss this example. \nThe local modal logic \\(\\blK\\) and the corresponding global one\n\\(\\bgk\\) are not only different, but their metalogical properties\ndiffer. For example \\(\\blK\\) has the deduction-detachment property for\n\\(\\rightarrow\\): \nBut \\(\\bgk\\) does not have the deduction-detachment property (at all).\n \nThe logic \\(\\bgk\\) is algebraizable and \\(\\blK\\) is not. The\nequivalent algebraic semantics of \\(\\bgk\\) is the variety \\(\\bMA\\) of\nmodal algebras, the set of equivalence formulas is the set \\(\\{p\n\\leftrightarrow q\\}\\) and the set of defining equations is \\(\\{p\n\\approx \\top \\}\\). Interestingly, \\(\\blK\\) and \\(\\bgk\\) have the same\nalgebraic counterpart (i.e., \\(\\bAlg \\blK = \\bAlg \\blK)\\), namely, the\nvariety of modal algebras. \nA lesson to draw from this example is that the algebraic counterpart\nof a logic \\(\\bL\\), i.e, the class of algebras \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\), does not\nnecessarily fully encode the properties of \\(\\bL\\). The class of modal\nalgebras encodes the properties of \\(\\bgk\\) because this logic is\nalgebraizable and so the link between \\(\\bgk\\) and \\(\\bAlg \\bgk\\) is\nas strong as possible. But \\(\\bAlg \\blK\\), the class of modal\nalgebras, cannot by itself completely encode the properties of\n\\(\\blK\\). \nWhat causes this difference between \\(\\bgk\\) and \\(\\blK\\) is that the\nclass of reduced matrix models of \\(\\bgk\\) is \n\n\\[\\{\\langle \\bA, \\{1^{\\bA }\\}\\rangle : \\bA \\in \\bMA\\},\\]\n\n but the\nclass of reduced matrix models of \\(\\blK\\) properly includes this\nclass so that for some algebras \\(\\bA \\in \\bMA\\), in addition to\n\\(\\{1^{\\bA }\\}\\) there is some other \\(\\blK\\)-filter \\(F\\) with\n\\(\\langle \\bA, F \\rangle\\) reduced. This fact provides a way to show\nthat \\(\\blK\\) can not be algebraizable by showing that the\n\\(\\blK\\)-filters of the reduced matrices are not equationally\ndefinable from the algebras; if they where, then for every \\(\\bA \\in\n\\bAlg \\blK\\) there would exists exactly one \\(\\blK\\)-filter \\(F\\) of\n\\(\\bA\\) such that \\(\\langle \\bA, F \\rangle\\) is reduced. \nNonetheless, we can perform some of the steps of the Lindenbaum-Tarski\nmethod in the logic \\(\\blK\\). We can define the Leibniz congruence of\nevery \\(\\blK\\)-theory in a uniform way by using formulas in two\nvariables. But in this particular case the set of formulas has to be infinite.\nLet \\(\\Delta(p, q) = \\{\\Box^n (p \\leftrightarrow q): n\\) a natural\nnumber\\(\\}\\), where for every formula \\(\\phi , \\Box^0\\phi\\) is\n\\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\Box^n\\phi\\) for \\(n \\gt 0\\) is the formula \\(\\phi\\)\nwith a sequence of \\(n\\) boxes in front \\((\\Box \\ldots^n \\ldots \\Box\n\\phi)\\). Then, for every \\(\\blK\\)-theory \\(T\\) the relation\n\\(\\theta(T)\\) defined by \nis the Leibniz congruence of \\(T\\). In this case, it happens though\nthat there are two different \\(\\blK\\)-theories with the same Leibniz\ncongruence, something that does not hold for \\(\\bgk\\). \nThe logics \\(\\bL\\) with the property that there is a set of formulas\n(possibly infinite) \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) in two variables which defines in\nevery \\(\\bL\\)-theory \\(T\\) its Leibniz congruence, that is, that for\nall \\(L\\)-formulas \\(\\phi , \\psi\\) it holds \n\n\\[\\langle \\phi , \\psi \\rangle \\in \\bOmega_{\\bFm }(T)\\txtiff \\Delta(\\phi , \\psi) \\subseteq T\\]\n\n are known as\nthe equivalential logics. If \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) is finite, the\nlogic is said to be finitely equivalential. A set \\(\\Delta(p,\nq)\\) that defines in every \\(\\bL\\)-theory its Leibniz congruence is\ncalled a set of equivalence formulas for \\(\\bL\\). It is clear\nthat every algebraizable logic is equivalential and that every\nfinitely algebraizable logic is finitely equivalential. \nThe logic \\(\\blK\\) is, according to the definition, equivalential, and\nit can be shown that it is not finitely equivalential. The local modal\nlogic lS4 is an example of a non-algebraizable logic\nthat is finitely equivalential. A set of equivalence formulas for\nlS4 is \\(\\{\\Box(p\\leftrightarrow q)\\}\\). \nA set of equivalence formulas for a logic \\(\\bL\\) should be considered\nas a generalized biconditional, in the sense that collectively the\nformulas in the set have the relevant properties of the biconditional,\nfor example of classical logic, that makes it suitable to define the\nLeibniz congruences of its theories. This comes out very clearly from\nthe following syntactic characterization of the sets of equivalence\nformulas. \nThere is some redundancy in the theorem. Conditions\n\\((\\tS_{\\Delta})\\) and \\((\\tT_{\\Delta})\\) follow from\n\\((\\tR_{\\Delta}),(\\tMP_{\\Delta})\\) and \\((\\tRe_{\\Delta})\\). \nEquivalential logics were first considered as a class of logics\ndeserving to be studied in Prucnal & Wroński 1974, and they\nhave been studied extensively in Czelakowski 1981; see also\nCzelakowski 2001.  \nWe already mentioned that the algebraizable logics are equivalential.\nThe difference between an equivalential logic and an algebraizable one\ncan be seen in the following syntactic characterization of\nalgebraizable logics: \nThe set \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) in the theorem is then an equivalence set of\nformulas for and the set \\(\\iEq(p)\\) a set of defining equations. \nThere are logics that are not equivalential but have the property of\nhaving a set of formulas \\([p \\Rightarrow q]\\) which collectively\nbehave in a very weak sense as the implication \\(\\rightarrow\\) does in\nmany logics. Namely, it has the properties \\((\\tR_{\\Delta})\\) and\n\\((\\tMP_{\\Delta})\\) in the syntactic characterization of a set of\nequivalence formulas, i.e.,  \nIf a logic is finitary and has a set of formulas with these\nproperties, there is always a finite subset with the same properties.\nThe logics with a set of formulas (finite or not) with properties\n (1)\n and\n (2)\n above are called protoalgebraic. in particular, every\nequivalential logic and every algebraizable logic are protoalgebraic.\n \nProtoalgebraic logics were first studied by Czelakowski, who called\nthem non-pathological, and a slightly later by Blok and Pigozzi in\nBlok & Pigozzi 1986. The label ‘protoalgebraic logic’\nis due to these last two authors.  \nThe class of protoalgebraic logics turned out to be the class of\nlogics for which the theory of logical matrices works really well in\nthe sense that many results of universal algebra have counterparts for\nthe classes of reduced matrix models of these logics and many methods\nof universal algebra can be adapted to its study; consequently the\nalgebraic study of protoalgebraic logics using their matrix semantics\nhas been extensively and very fruitfully pursued. But, as we will see,\nsome interesting logics are not protoalgebraic.  \nAn important characterization of protoalgebraic logics is via the\nbehavior of the Leibniz operator. The following conditions are\nequivalent: \nDue to the monotonicity property of the Leibniz operator, for any\nprotoalgebraic logic \\(\\bL\\) the class of algebras \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) is\nclosed under subdirect products and therefore it is equal to\n\\(\\bAlg\\bL\\). Hence for protoalgebraic logics the two ways we\nencountered to associate a class of algebras with a logic produce, as\nwe already mentioned, the same result. \nThere are also characterizations of equivalential and finitely\nequivalential logics by the behavior of the Leibniz operator. The\nreader is referred to Czelakowski 2001 and Font & Jansana &\nPigozzi 2003.  \nIn his Raftery 2006b, Raftery studies Condition 7 in the list of\nproperties of an algebraizable logic we gave just after the\ndefinition. The condition says: \nFor every \\(\\bA \\in \\bAlg^*\\bL\\) the class of reduced matrix models of\n\\(\\bL\\) is \\(\\{\\langle \\bA, \\iEq(\\bA) \\rangle : \\bA \\in\n\\bAlg^*\\bL\\}\\), where \\(\\iEq(p)\\) is the set of defining equations for\n\\(\\bL\\). \nThe logics with a set of equations \\(\\iEq(p)\\) with this property,\nnamely such that for every \\(\\bA \\in \\bAlg^*\\bL\\) the class of reduced\nmatrix models of \\(\\bL\\) is \\(\\{\\langle \\bA, \\iEq(\\bA) \\rangle : \\bA\n\\in \\bAlg^*\\bL\\}\\), are called truth-equational, a name\nintroduced in Raftery 2006b. Some truth-equational logics are\nprotoalgebraic but others are not. We will see later an example of the\nlast situation. \nThe protoalgebraic logics that are truth-equational are in fact the\nweakly algebraizable logics studied already in Czelakowski\n& Jansana 2000. Every algebraizable logic is weakly algebraizable.\nIn fact, the algebraizable logics are the equivalential logics that\nare truth-equational. But not every weakly algebraizable logic is\nequivalential. An example is the quantum logic determined by the\nortolattices, namely by the class of the matrices \\(\\langle \\bA, \\{1\\}\n\\rangle\\) where \\(\\bA\\) is an ortolattice and 1 is its greatest\nelement (see Czelakowski & Jansana 2000 and Malinowski 1990). \nThe classes of logics we have considered so far are the main classes\nin what has come to be known as the Leibniz hierarchy because\nits members are classes of logics that can be characterized by the\nbehavior of the Leibniz operator. We described only the most important\nclasses of logics in the hierarchy. The reader is referred to\nCzelakowski 2001, Font 2016b, Font, Jansana & Pigozzi 2003, and\nFont 2016b for more information. In particular, Czelakowski 2001\ngathers extensively the information on the different classes of the\nLeibniz hierarchy known at the time of its publication. The relations\nbetween the classes of the Leibniz hierarchy considered in this entry\nare summarized in the following diagram: \nFigure. The Leibniz Hierarchy \nRecently the Leibniz hierarchy has been refined in Cintula &\nNoguera 2010, 2016. The idea is to consider instead of sets of\nequivalence formulas \\(\\Delta\\) (that correspond to the biconditional)\nsets of formulas \\([p\\Rightarrow q]\\) with properties of the\nconditional \\((\\rightarrow)\\), among which \\((R_{\\Rightarrow})\\) and\n\\((MP_{\\Rightarrow})\\), and such that the set \\([p\\Rightarrow q]\n\\cup[p\\Rightarrow q]\\) is a set of equivalence formulas. New classes\narise when the set \\([p\\Rightarrow q]\\) has a single element. \nTwo classes of logics that are not classes of the Leibniz hierarchy\nhave been extensively studied in abstract algebraic logic. They are\ndefined from a completely different perspective from the one provided\nby the behavior of the Leibniz operator, namely from the perspective\ngiven by the replacement principles a logic might enjoy.  \nThe strongest replacement principle that a logic system \\(\\bL\\) might\nhave, shared for example by classical logic, intuitionistic logic and\nall its axiomatic extensions, says that for any set of formulas\n\\(\\Gamma\\), any formulas \\(\\phi , \\psi , \\delta\\) and any variable\n\\(p\\) \nif \\(\\Gamma , \\phi \\vdash_{\\bL } \\psi\\) and \\(\\Gamma , \\psi\n\\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\), then \\(\\Gamma , \\delta(p/\\phi) \\vdash_{\\bL }\n\\delta(p/\\psi)\\) and \\(\\Gamma , \\delta(p/\\psi) \\vdash_{\\bL }\n\\delta(p/\\phi)\\), \nwhere \\(\\delta(p/\\phi)\\) and \\(\\delta(p/\\psi)\\) are the formulas\nobtained by substituting respectively \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) for \\(p\\)\nin \\(\\delta\\). This replacement property is taken by some authors as\nthe formal counterpart of Frege’s principle of compositionality\nfor truth. Logics satisfying this strong replacement property are\ncalled Fregean in Font& Jansana 1996 and are thoroughly studied in\nCzelakowski & Pigozzi 2004a, 2004b. \nMany important logics do not satisfy the strong replacement property,\nfor instance almost all the logics (local or global) of the modal\nfamily, but some, like the local consequence relation of a normal\nmodal logic, satisfy a weaker replacement principle: for all formulas\n\\(\\phi , \\psi , \\delta\\), \nif \\(\\phi \\vdash_{\\bL }\\psi\\) and \\(\\psi \\vdash_{\\bL }\\phi\\), then\n\\(\\delta(p/\\phi) \\vdash_{\\bL } \\delta(p/\\psi)\\) and \\(\\delta(p/\\psi)\n\\vdash_{\\bL } \\delta(p/\\phi)\\). \nA logic satisfying this weaker replacement property is called\nselfextensional by Wójcicki (e.g., in Wójcicki\n1969, 1988) and congruential in Humberstone 2005. We will use\nthe first terminology because it seems more common—at least in\nthe abstract algebraic logic literature.  \nSelfextensional logics have a very good behavior from several points\nof view. Their systematic study started in Wójcicki 1969 and\nhas recently been continued in the context of abstract algebraic logic\nin Font & Jansana 1996; Jansana 2005, 2006; and Jansana &\nPalmigiano 2006. \nThere are selfextensional and non-selfextensional logics in any one of\nthe classes of the Leibniz hierarchy and also in the class of\nnon-protoalgebraic logics. These facts show that the perspective that\nleads to the consideration of the classes in the Leibniz hierarchy and\nthe perspective that leads to the definition of the selfextensional\nand the Fregean logics as classes of logics worthy of study as a whole\nare to a large extent different. Nonetheless, one of the trends of\ntoday’s research in abstract algebraic logic is to determine the\ninterplay between the two perspectives and study the classes of logics\nthat arise when crossing both classifications. In fact, there is a\nconnection between the replacement principles and the Suszko\ncongruence (and thus with the Leibniz congruence). A logic \\(\\bL\\)\nsatisfies the strong replacement principle if and only if for every\n\\(\\bL\\)-theory \\(T\\) its Suszko congruence is the interderivability\nrelation relative to \\(T\\), namely the relation \\(\\{\\langle \\phi ,\n\\psi \\rangle : T, \\phi \\vdash_{\\bL } \\psi\\) and \\(T, \\psi \\vdash_{\\bL\n} \\phi \\}\\). And a logic \\(\\bL\\) satisfies the weak replacement\nprinciple if and only if the Suszko congruence of the set of theorems\nof \\(\\bL\\) is the interderivability relation \\(\\{\\langle \\phi , \\psi\n\\rangle : \\phi \\vdash_{\\bL } \\psi\\) and \\(\\psi \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\n\\}\\). \nNot all interesting logics are protoalgebraic. In this section we will\nbriefly discuss four examples of non-protoalgebraic logics: the logic\nof conjunction and disjunction, positive modal logic, the strict\nimplication fragment of \\(\\blK\\) and Visser’s subintuitionistic\nlogic. All of them are selfextensional. In the next section, we will\nexpound the semantics of abstract logics and generalized matrices that\nserves to develop a really general theory of the algebraization of\nlogic systems. As we will see, the perspective changes in an important\nrespect from the perspective taken in logical matrix model theory. \nThis logic is the \\(\\{\\wedge , \\vee , \\bot , \\top \\}\\)-fragment of\nClassical Propositional Logic. Hence its language is the set\n\\(\\{\\wedge , \\vee , \\top , \\bot \\}\\) and its consequence relation is\ngiven by  \nIt turns out that it is also the \\(\\{\\wedge , \\vee , \\bot , \\top\n\\}\\)-fragment of Intuitionistic Propositional Logic. Let us denote it\nby \\(\\bL^{\\{\\wedge , \\vee \\}}\\). \nThe logic \\(\\bL^{ \\{\\wedge , \\vee \\}}\\) is not protoalgebraic but it\nis Fregean. Its classes of algebras \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL^{ \\{\\wedge , \\vee\n\\}}\\) and \\(\\bAlg\\bL^{ \\{\\wedge , \\vee \\}}\\) are different. Moreover,\n\\(\\bAlg\\bL^{\\{\\wedge , \\vee \\}}\\) is the variety of bounded\ndistributive lattices, the class of algebras naturally expected to be\nthe associated with \\(\\bL^{ \\{\\wedge , \\vee \\}}\\), but \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL^{\n\\{\\wedge , \\vee \\}}\\) is strictly included in it. In fact, this last\nclass of algebras is not a quasivariety, but it is first-order\ndefinable still.  \nThe logic \\(\\bL^{\\{\\wedge , \\vee \\}}\\) is thus a natural example of a logic\nwhere the class of algebras of its reduced matrix models is not the\nright class of algebras expected to correspond to it (see Font &\nVerdú 1991 where the logic is studied at length). The\nproperties of this example and its treatment in Font &\nVerdú 1991 motivated the systematic study in Font & Jansana\n1996 of the kind of\nmodels for sentential logics considered in Brown & Suszko 1973,\nnamely, abstract logics.  \nPositive Modal Logic is the \\(\\{\\wedge , \\vee , \\Box , \\Diamond , \\bot\n, \\top \\}\\)-fragment of the local normal modal logic \\(\\blK\\). We\ndenote it by \\(\\bPML\\). This logic has some interest in Computer\nScience. \nThe logic \\(\\bPML\\) is not protoalgebraic, it is not truth-equational,\nit is selfextensional and it is not Fregean. Its algebraic counterpart\n\\(\\bAlg \\bPML\\) is the class of positive modal algebras introduced by\nDunn in Dunn 1995. The logic is studied in Jansana 2002 from the\nperspective of abstract algebraic logic. The class of algebras\n\\(\\bAlg\\bPML\\) is different from \\(\\bAlg^*\\bPML\\). \nThis logic is the logic in the language of intuitionistic logic that\nhas to the least normal modal logic \\(K\\) the same relation that\nintuitionistic logic has to the normal modal logic \\(S4\\). It was\nintroduced in Visser 1981 (under the name Basic Propositional Logic)\nand has been studied by several authors, such as Ardeshir, Alizadeh,\nand Ruitenburg. It is not protoalgebraic, it is truth-equational and\nit is Fregean (hence also selfextensional).  \nThe strict implication of the language of modal logic is defined using\nthe \\(\\Box\\) operator and the material implication \\(\\rightarrow\\). We\nwill use \\(\\Rightarrow\\) for the strict implication. Its definition is\n\\(\\phi \\Rightarrow \\psi := \\Box(\\phi \\rightarrow \\psi)\\). The language\nof the logic \\(\\bSilK\\), that we call the strict implication fragment\nof the local modal logic \\(\\blK\\), is the language \\(L = \\{\\wedge ,\n\\vee , \\bot , \\top , \\Rightarrow \\}\\). We can translate the formulas\nof \\(L\\) to formulas of the modal language by systematically replacing\nin an \\(L\\)-formula \\(\\phi\\) every subformula of the form \\(\\psi\n\\Rightarrow \\delta\\) by \\(\\Box(\\psi \\rightarrow \\delta)\\) and\nrepeating the process until no appearance of \\(\\Rightarrow\\) is left.\nLet us denote by \\(\\phi^*\\) the translation of \\(\\phi\\) and by\n\\(\\Gamma^*\\) the set of the translations of the formulas in\n\\(\\Gamma\\). Then the definition of the consequence relation of\n\\(\\bSilK\\) is: \nThe logic \\(\\bSilK\\) is not protoalgebraic and is not\ntruth-equational. It is selfextensional but it is not Fregean. Its\nalgebraic counterpart \\(\\bAlg \\bSilK\\) is the class of bounded\ndistributive lattices with a binary operation with the properties of\nthe strict implication of \\(\\blK\\). This class of algebras is\nintroduced and studied in Celani & Jansana 2005, where its members\nare called Weakly Heyting algebras. \\(\\bAlg \\bSilK\\) does not coincide\nwith \\(\\bAlg^* \\bSilK\\). \nThe logic \\(\\bSilK\\) belongs, as Visser’s logic, to the family\nof so-called subintuitionistic logics. A reference to look at for\ninformation on these logics is Celani & Jansana 2003. \nThe logical matrix models of a given logic can be thought of as\nalgebraic generalizations of its theories, more precisely, of its\nLindenbaum matrices. They come from taking a local perspective\ncentered around the theories of the logic considered one by one, and\nits analogs the logic filters (also taken one by one). But, as we will\nsee, the properties of a logic depend in general on the global\nbehavior of the set of its theories taken together as a bunch;\nor—to put it otherwise—on its consequence relation. The\nconsideration of this global behavior introduces a global perspective\non the design of semantics for logic systems. The abstract logics that\nwe are going to define can be seen, in contrast to logical matrices,\nas algebraic generalizations of the logic itself and its extensions.\nThey are the natural objects to consider when one takes the global\nperspective seriously.  \nLet \\(L\\) be a propositional language. An \\(L\\)-abstract\nlogic is a pair \\(\\cA = \\langle \\bA\\), C \\(\\rangle\\) where\n\\(\\bA\\) is an \\(L\\)-algebra and \\(C\\) an abstract consequence\noperation on \\(A\\).  \nGiven a logic \\(\\bL\\), an \\(L\\)-abstract logic \\(\\cA = \\langle \\bA, C\n\\rangle\\) is a model of \\(\\bL\\) if for every set of formulas\n\\(\\Gamma\\) and every formula \\(\\phi\\) \n\\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\txtiff\\) for every valuation \\(v\\) on\n\\(\\bA, \\bv(\\phi) \\in C(\\bv[\\Gamma])\\). \nThis definition has an equivalent in terms of the closed sets of\n\\(C\\): an abstract logic \\(\\cA = \\langle \\bA, C \\rangle\\) is a model\nof \\(\\bL\\) if and only if for every \\(C\\)-closed set \\(X\\) the matrix\n\\(\\langle \\bA, X \\rangle\\) is a model of \\(\\bL\\) (i.e., \\(X\\) is an\n\\(\\bL\\)-filter). \nThis observation leads to another point of view on abstract logics as\nmodels of a logic system. It transforms them into a collection of\nlogical matrices (given by the closed sets) over the same algebra, or,\nto put it more simply, into a pair \\(\\langle \\bA, \\cB \\rangle\\) where\n\\(\\cB\\) is a collection of subsets of \\(A\\). A structure of this type\nis called in the literature a generalized matrix\n(Wójcicki 1973) and more recently it has been called an\natlas in Dunn & Hardegree 2001. It is said to be a model\nof a logic \\(\\bL\\) if for every \\(X \\in \\cB, \\langle \\bA, X \\rangle\\)\nis a matrix model of \\(\\bL\\). \nA logic system \\(\\bL = \\langle L, \\vdash_{\\bL } \\rangle\\)\nstraightforwardly provides us with an equivalent abstract logic\n\\(\\langle \\bFm_L, C_{\\vdash_{ \\bL} } \\rangle\\) and an equivalent\ngeneralized matrix \\(\\langle \\bFm_L,\\tTH(\\bL) \\rangle\\), where\n\\(\\tTH(\\bL)\\) is the set of \\(C_{\\vdash_{ \\bL}}\\)-closed sets of\nformulas (i.e., the \\(\\bL\\)-theories). We will move freely from one to\nthe other. \nThe generalized matrices \\(\\langle \\bA, \\cB \\rangle\\) that correspond\nto abstract logics have the following two properties: \\(A \\in \\cB\\)\nand \\(\\cB\\) is closed under intersections of arbitrary nonempty\nfamilies. A family \\(\\cB\\) of subsets of a set \\(A\\) with these two\nproperties is known as a closed-set system and also as a\nclosure system. There is a dual correspondence between\nabstract consequence operations on a set \\(A\\) and closed-set systems\non \\(A\\). Given an abstract consequence operation \\(C\\) on \\(A\\), the\nset \\(\\cC_C\\) of \\(C\\)-closed sets is a closed-set system and given a\nclosed-set system \\(\\cC\\) the operation \\(C_{\\cC}\\) defined by\n\\(C_{\\cC }(X) = \\bigcap \\{Y \\in \\cC: X \\subseteq Y\\}\\), for every \\(X\n\\subseteq A\\), is an abstract consequence operation. In general, every\ngeneralized matrix \\(\\langle \\bA, \\cB \\rangle\\) can be turned into a\nclosed-set system by adding to \\(\\cB \\cup \\{A\\}\\) the intersections of\narbitrary nonempty subfamilies, and therefore into an abstract logic,\nwhich we denote by \\(\\langle \\bA, C_{\\cB }\\rangle\\). In that situation\nwe say that \\(\\cB\\) is a base for \\(C_{\\cB}\\). It is obvious\nthat an abstract logic can have more than one base. Any family of\nclosed sets with the property that every closed set is an intersection\nof elements of the family is a base. The study of bases for the closed\nset system of the theories of a logic usually plays an important role\nin its study. For example, in classical logic an important base for\nthe family of its theories is the family of maximal consistent\ntheories and in intuitionistic logic the family of prime theories. In\na similar way, the systematic study of bases for generalized matrix\nmodels of a logic becomes important. \nIn order to make the exposition smooth we will now move from abstract\nlogics to generalized matrices. Let \\(\\cA = \\langle \\bA, \\cB \\rangle\\)\nbe a generalized matrix. There exists the greatest congruence of\n\\(\\bA\\) compatible with all the sets in \\(\\cB\\); it is known as the\nTarski congruence of \\(\\cA\\). We denote it by\n\\(\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bA }(\\cB)\\). It has the following characterization\nusing the Leibniz operator \nIt can also be characterized by the condition: \n\\(\\langle a, b \\rangle \\in \\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bA }(\\cB)\\txtiff\\) for\nevery \\(\\phi(p, q_1 , \\ldots ,q_n)\\), every \\(c_1 , \\ldots ,c_n \\in\nA\\) and all \\(X \\in \\cB\\)  \nor equivalently by \n\\(\\langle a, b \\rangle \\in \\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bA }(\\cB)\\txtiff\\) for\nevery \\(\\phi(p, q_1 , \\ldots ,q_n)\\) and every \\(c_1 , \\ldots ,c_n \\in\nA, C_{\\cB }(\\phi^{\\bA }[a, c_1 , \\ldots ,c_n]) = C_{\\cB }(\\phi^{\\bA\n}[b, c_1 , \\ldots ,c_n])\\). \nA generalized matrix is reduced if its Tarski congruence is\nthe identity. Every generalized matrix \\(\\langle \\bA, \\cB \\rangle\\)\ncan be turned into an equivalent reduced one by identifying the\nelements related by its Tarski congruence. The result is the quotient\ngeneralized matrix \\(\\langle \\bA / \\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bA }(\\cB),\n\\cB/\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bA }(\\cB) \\rangle\\), where\n\\(\\cB/\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bA }(\\cB) = \\{X/\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bA }(\\cB): X\n\\in \\cB\\}\\) and for \\(X \\in \\cB, X/\\bOmega^{\\sim}_{\\bA }(\\cB)\\) is the\nset of equivalence classes of the elements of \\(X\\). \nThe properties of a logic \\(\\bL\\) depend in general, as we already\nsaid, on the global behavior of the family of its theories. In some\nlogics, this behavior is reflected in the behavior of its set of\ntheorems, as in classical and intuitionistic logic due to the\ndeduction-detachment property, but this is by no means the most\ngeneral situation, as it is witnessed by the example of the local and\nglobal modal logics of the normal modal logic \\(K\\). Both have the\nsame theorems but do not share the same properties. Recall that the\nlocal logic has the deduction-detachment property but the global one\nnot. In a similar way, the properties of a logic are in\ngeneral better encoded in an algebraic setting if we consider\nfamilies of \\(\\bL\\)-filters on the algebras than if we consider a\nsingle \\(\\bL\\)-filter as it is done in logical matrices model\ntheory. \nThe generalized matrix models that have naturally attracted most of\nthe attention in the research on the algebraization of logics are the\ngeneralized matrices of the form \\(\\langle \\bA, \\tFi_{\\bL }\\bA\n\\rangle\\) where \\(\\tFi_{\\bL }\\bA\\) is the set of all the\n\\(\\bL\\)-filters of \\(\\bA\\). An example of a property of logics encoded\nin the structure of the lattices of \\(\\bL\\)-filters of the\n\\(L\\)-algebras is that for every finitary protoalgebraic logic \\(\\bL,\n\\bL\\) has the deduction-detachment property if and only if for every\nalgebra \\(\\bA\\) the join-subsemilattice of the lattice of all\n\\(\\bL\\)-filters of \\(\\bA\\) that consists of the finitely generated\n\\(\\bL\\)-filters is dually residuated; see Czelakowski 2001. \nThe generalized matrices of the form \\(\\langle \\bA, \\tFi_{\\bL }\\bA\n\\rangle\\) are called the basic full g-models of \\(\\bL\\) (the\nletter ‘g’ stands for generalized matrix). The interest in\nthese models lead to the consideration of the class of generalized\nmatrix models of a logic \\(\\bL\\) with the property that their quotient\nby their Tarski congruence is a basic full g-model. These generalized\nmatrices (and their corresponding abstract logics) are called full\ng-models. The theory of the full g-models of an arbitrary logic\nis developed in Font & Jansana 1996, where the notion of full\ng-model and basic full g-model is introduced. We will mention some of\nthe main results obtained there. \nLet \\(\\bL\\) be a logic system.  \nThe isomorphism\n theorem (4)\n above is a generalization of the isomorphism theorems we encountered\nearlier for algebraizable logics. What is interesting here is that the\ntheorem holds for every logic system. Using\n (2) above,\n theorem (4) entails the isomorphism theorem for finitary and finitely\nalgebraizable logics. Thus\n theorem (4)\n can be seen as the most general formulation of the mathematical\nlogical phenomena that underlies the isomorphism theorems between the\ncongruences of the algebras in a certain class and some kind of\nsubsets of them we mentioned in\n Section 9.\n  \nThe use of generalized matrices and abstract logics as models for\nlogic systems has proved very useful for the study of selfextensional\nlogics in general and more in particular for the study of the\nselextenional logics that are not protoalgebraic such as the logics discused in\n Section 12.\n In particular, they have proved very useful for the study of the\nclass of finitary selfextensional logics with a conjunction and the\nclass of finitary selfextensional logics with the deduction-detachment\nproperty for a single term, say \\(p \\rightarrow q\\); the logics in\nthis last class are nevertheless protoalgebraic. A logic \\(\\bL\\) has a\nconjunction if there is a formula in two variables \\(\\phi(p,\nq)\\) such that \nThe logics in those two classes have the following property: the\nTarski relation of every full g-model \\(\\langle \\bA, C \\rangle\\) is\n\\(\\{\\langle a, b \\rangle \\in A \\times A: C(a) = C(b)\\}\\). A way of\nsaying it is to say that for these logics the property that defines\nselfextensionality, namely that the interderivability condition is a\ncongruence, lifts or transfers to every full g-model. The\nselfextensional logics with this property are called fully\nselfextensional. This notion was introduced in Font & Jansana\n1996 under the name ‘strongly selfextensional’. All the\nknown and natural selfextensional logics are fully selfextensional, in\nparticular the logics discussed in\n Section 12,\n but Babyonyshev showed (Babyonyshev 2003) an ad hoc example of\na selfextensional logic that is not fully selfextensional.  \nAn interesting result on the finitary logics which are fully\nselfextensional logics with a conjunction or with the\ndeduction-detachment property for a single term is that their class of\nalgebras \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) is always a variety. The researchers in abstract\nalgebraic logic are somehow surprised by the fact that several\nfinitary and finitely algebraizable logics have a variety as its\nequivalent algebraic semantics, when the theory of algebraizable\nlogics allows in general to prove only that the equivalent algebraic\nsemantics of a finitary and finitely algebraizable logic is a\nquasivariety. The result explains this phenomenon for the finitary and\nfinitely algebraizable logics to which it applies. For many other\nfinitary and finitely algebraizable logics to find a convincing\nexplanation is still an open area of research. \nEvery abstract logic \\(\\cA = \\langle \\bA, C \\rangle\\) determines a\nquasi-order (a reflexive and transitive relation) on \\(A\\). It is the\nrelation defined by \n\n\\[a \\le_{\\cA } b\\txtiff C(b) \\subseteq C(a)\\txtiff b \\in C(a).\\] \nThus \\(a \\le_{\\cA } b\\) if and only if \\(b\\) belongs to every\n\\(C\\)-closed set to which \\(A\\) belongs. For a fully selfextensional\nlogic \\(\\bL\\), this quasi-order turns into a partial order in the\nreduced full g-models, which are in fact the reduced basic full\ng-models, namely, the abstract logics \\(\\langle \\bA, \\tFi_{\\bL }\\bA\n\\rangle\\) with \\(\\bA \\in \\bAlg\\bL\\). Consequently, in a fully\nselfextensional logic \\(\\bL\\) every algebra \\(\\bA \\in \\bAlg\\bL\\)\ncarries a partial order definable in terms of the family of the\n\\(\\bL\\)-filters. If the logic is fully selfextensional with a\nconjunction this partial order is definable by an equation of the\n\\(L\\)-algebraic language because in this case for every algebra \\(\\bA\n\\in \\bAlg\\bL\\) we have: \n\n\\[a \\le b\\txtiff C(b) \\subseteq C(a)\\txtiff C(a \\wedge^{\\bA } b) = C(a)\\txtiff a \\wedge^{\\bA } b = a,\\]\n\n where \\(C\\) is the abstract\nconsequence operation that corresponds to the closed-set system\n\\(\\tFi_{\\bL }\\bA\\), and \\(\\wedge^{\\bA}\\) is the operation defined on\n\\(\\bA\\) by the formula that is a conjunction for the logic\n\\(\\bL\\). \nA similar situation holds for fully selfextensional logics with the\ndeduction-detachment property for a single term, say \\(p \\rightarrow\nq\\), for then for every algebra \\(\\bA \\in \\bAlg\\bL\\)  \nThese observations lead us to view the finitary fully selfextensional\nlogics \\(\\bL\\) with a conjunction and those with the\ndeduction-detachment property for a single term as logics definable by\nan order which is definable in the algebras in \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) by using\nan equation of the \\(\\bL\\)-algebraic language. Related to this, the\nfollowing result is known. \n\\(\\phi_1 , \\ldots ,\\phi_n\\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\txtiff\\) for all \\(\\bA \\in\n\\bK\\) and every valuation \\(v\\) on \\(\\bA \\; \\bv(\\phi_1) \\wedge^{\\bA\n}\\ldots \\wedge^{\\bA } \\bv(\\phi_n) \\le \\bv(\\phi)\\) \nand \n\\(\\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\txtiff\\) for all \\(\\bA \\in \\bK\\) and every\nvaluation \\(v\\) on \\(\\bA \\; a \\le \\bv(\\phi)\\), for every \\(a \\in A\\).\n \nMoreover, in this case the class of algebras \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) is the\nvariety generated by \\(\\bK\\).  \nSimilar results can be obtained for the selfextensional logics with\nthe deduction-detachment property for a single term. The reader is\nreferred to Jansana 2006 for a study of the selfextensional logics\nwith conjunction, and to Jansana 2005 for a study of the\nselfextensional logics with the deduction-detachment property for a\nsingle term.  \nThe class of selfextensional logics with a\nconjunction includes the so-called logics preserving degrees of truth\nstudied in the fields of substructural logics and of many-valued\nlogics. The reader can look at Bou et al. 2009 and the references\ntherein. \nThe research on logic systems described in the previous sections has\nbeen extended to encompass other consequence relations that go beyond\npropositional logics, like equational logics and the consequence\nrelations between sequents built from the formulas of a propositional\nlanguage definable using sequent calculi. The interested reader can\nconsult the excellent paper Raftery 2006a. \nThis research arose the need for an, even more, abstract way of\ndeveloping the theory of consequence relations. It has lead to a\nreformulation (in a category-theoretic setting) of the theory of logic\nsystems as explained in this entry. The work has been done mainly by\nG. Voutsadakis in a series of papers, e.g., Voutsadakis 2002.\nVoutsadakis’s approach uses the notion of a pi-institution,\nintroduced by Fiadeiro and Sernadas, as the analog of the logic\nsystems in his category-theoretic setting. Some work in this direction\nis also found in Gil-Férez 2006. A different approach to a\ngeneralization of the studies encompassing the work done for logic\nsystems and for sequent calculi is found in Galatos & Tsinakis\n2009; Gil-Férez 2011 is also in this line. The work presented\nin these two papers originates in Blok & Jónsson 2006. The\nGalatos-Tsinakis approach has been recently extended in a way that\nalso encompasses the setting of Voutsadakis in Galatos &\nGil-Férez 2017. \nAnother recent line of research that extends the framework described\nin this entry develops a theory of algebraization of many-sorted logic\nsystems using instead of the equational consequence relation of the\nnatural class of algebras a many-sorted behavioral equational\nconsequence (a notion coming from computer science) and a weaker\nconcept than algebraizable logic: behaviorally algebraizable logic.\nSee Caleiro, Gonçalves & Martins 2009.","contact.mail":"jansana@ub.edu","contact.domain":"ub.edu"}]
