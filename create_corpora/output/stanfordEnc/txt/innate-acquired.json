It has even been argued\nthat this distinction is itself part of the evolved psychology of the\nhuman species. The distinction played an important role in the history\nof philosophy as the locus of the dispute between Rationalism and\nEmpiricism discussed in\n another entry\n in this encyclopedia. This entry, however, focuses on\ntwentieth-century accounts of the innate/acquired distinction. These\naccounts have for the most part been inspired by the sciences of mind\nand behaviour.\n\n\n\nInnateness must be clearly distinguished from heritability, at least\nin the scientific sense of that term. The idea that heritability scores\nmeasure the degree to which a characteristic is innate is a vulgar\nfallacy. Heritability is a statistical measure of the sources of\nindividual differences in a population. While heritability itself is\nwell understood, its relationship to the innate/acquired distinction\nremains highly controversial.\n\n\n\nThe belief that a trait is innate is today commonly expressed by\nsaying it is ‘in the genes’. But genes play an essential\nrole in the production of every trait. Consequently, it will not do to\nsay simply that innate traits are ‘caused by genes’ whilst\nacquired traits are ‘caused by the environment’. Any\nrelationship between genetic causation and the innate/acquired\ndistinction will be far more complex than this.\n\n\n\nRecent philosophical analyses of the innate/acquired distinction can\nbe classified into four types. The first identifies innate traits with\nthose characteristic of an entire species and identifies acquired\ntraits with those that vary between populations and individuals. A\nsecond type of analysis identifies innate traits with those that can be\nexplained by natural selection. The third, and currently the most\ninfluential, identifies innate traits with those produced by a\nparticular patterns of interaction between genes and environment. A\nfourth, quite different, type of analysis suggests that labelling a\ntrait ‘innate’ is a way to indicate that it lies outside\nthe domain of psychology.\n\n\n\nFinally, there is a tradition of scepticism about the\ninnate/acquired distinction. Sceptics argue that it confounds a number\nof distinctions that are better kept separate, or, perhaps\nequivalently, that there is no one property of a trait that corresponds\nto its being innate.\n\n\n\nInstinctive behaviour was at the heart of early 20th\ncentury psychology and accounts of instinct were offered by many\nleading psychologists of the period, including Conwy Lloyd Morgan,\nJames Mark Baldwin, William James and William McDougall (Richards\n1987). In the 1920s, however, a strong reaction against the idea of\ninstinct developed in psychology in North America (e.g. Dunlap 1919;\nKuo 1921). In part, this was a reaction to the apparently unconstrained\npostulation of new ‘instincts’. The critics were also\nsuspicious of the vitalistic sympathies of some leading instinct\ntheorists, particularly McDougall (1908; 1923). Most importantly,\nhowever, appeals to instinct appeared scientifically vacuous when set\nagainst the experimentally testable, mechanistic explanations offered\nby the emerging behaviorist school of psychology. The most radical\ncritics believed that even John Broadus Watson, the founder of\nbehaviourism, had conceded too much to instinct by allowing that a\nsmall number of links between simple stimuli and responses were inborn\n(Watson 1925). A scientist should never be satisfied to say that\nbehaviour is ‘inherited’ or ‘instinctive’,\nargued Zing Yang Kuo, since this merely poses the question ‘How\nare our instincts acquired?’ (Kuo 1922). Few psychologists went\nas far as Kuo (see, e.g. Tolman 1922) but criticisms like this\neffectively banished the idea of instinct from scientific psychology,\nat least in North America. \n\nThe study of instinct was rehabilitated in the years on either side\nof World War Two by the founders of ethology, Konrad Lorenz and Niko\nTinbergen (Tinbergen 1942; Tinbergen 1951; Lorenz 1957 (1937); Lorenz\nand Tinbergen 1957 (1938)). Ethology was a Darwinian approach to\nbehaviour and the direct ancestor of today's behavioural ecology\nand sociobiology. It treated an organism's behavior as simply one\nmore evolved characteristic alongside its skeleton and its digestive\nsystem. Instinctive behavior was thought to be composed of identifiable\nunits– ‘fixed action patterns’ — whose evolution\ncould be studied like that of a bone by comparing the different form\ntaken by the same (homologous) behavior in different species. The\nevolutionary relationships of birds, for example, were thought to be\nreflected in similarities and differences in their courtship rituals as\nsurely as in similarities and differences in their bones. \n\nThe early ethologists placed considerable emphasis on the\n‘deprivation experiment’, in which an animal is raised\nwithout the opportunity to learn a behavior and then tested to see if\nit can perform the behaviour when provided with an appropriate\nstimulus. A songbird, for example, can be raised from egg to adult\nwithout hearing a member of its own species sing, and tested to see\nwhich song it produces the following spring. If it produces the\ntypical song of its own species, then the song is innate. But the\ninnate/acquired distinction was not defined solely by this test. The\nearly ethologists also emphasised the stereotypical nature of the\nbehaviours that constitute a fixed action pattern, the fact that the\npattern is ‘released’ as a whole rather than requiring\ninput from the environment for its completion, and the fact that\ninnate behaviours occur spontaneously as ‘vacuum\nactivities’ when the animal is deprived of the specific stimuli\nthat usually elicits the behaviour. They drew further support from the\nfact that the comparative patterns found in the behaviour of different\nspecies were congruent with those found by comparing morphological\ncharacteristics. The idea of a distinctive realm of instinctive\nbehaviour was thus a theoretical postulate supported by multiple lines\nof evidence, rather than a matter of definition (for more on Lorenz\nand Tinbergen's ideas about instinct, see Griffiths 2004; Brigandt\n2005; Browne 2005 (Other Internet Resources); Burkhardt 2005). \n\nThe idea of instinct in classical ethology was strongly criticised\nby several North American psychologists, most famously by Daniel S.\nLehrman in ‘A critique of Konrad Lorenz's theory of instinctive\nbehavior’ (Lehrman 1953). This paper documented the role of\nenvironmental factors in the development of species-typical behavior\npatterns, drawing on many existing studies, including some by Kuo.\nEndogenous and exogenous influences on behavioral development interact\nin numerous ways, Lehrman argued, and no one pattern of interaction is\ndistinctive of the development of evolved features of the behavioral\nphenotype. According to Lehrman, Lorenz's attempt to draw a sharp\ndistinction between instinctive and acquired behavior was simply\nuntenable in the light of what was already known about behavioral\ndevelopment. Lehrman summarised his position at a later date: \n\nLehrman was particularly critical of the use of the deprivation\nexperiment to infer that a certain trait is innate\nsimpliciter, rather than merely that the factors controlled\nfor in the experiment are not needed for the development of that trait.\nMany of Lehrman's ideas were incorporated into mainstream\nethological theory. By the 1960s Tinbergen regarded the use of the term\n‘innate’ to characterize behaviors as “heuristically\nharmful” (Tinbergen 1963, 425) and endorsed Lehrman's\ncritique of the deprivation experiment: “The conclusion can only\nbe formulated correctly in negative terms, in describing which\nenvironmental aspect was shown not to be influential”\n(Tinbergen 1963, 424). In the same period Tinbergen and his students\nshifted the focus of their research from behaviors as stable\ntaxonomic characters to behaviors as adaptations shaped by the\necological demands of the environment (Burkhardt 2005; Griffiths 2008).\nDetermining the extent to which behaviour develops independently of the\nenvironment ceased to be important to the Tinbergen school, or to the\nnew discipline of behavioural ecology in which students of Tinbergen\nlike Richard Dawkins played such a prominent role. Interest turned\ninstead to testing population genetic and game theoretic models of\nbehavioural evolution. \n\nLorenz responded to his critics with a new account of the\ninnate/acquired distinction (Lorenz 1965; see also Browne 2005 (Other\nInternet Resources)). No trait is innate in itself, but “certain\nparts of the information which underly the adaptedness of the whole,\nand which can be ascertained by the deprivation experiment, are indeed\ninnate” (Lorenz 1965, 40). A trait is innate insofar as its\ndevelopment is guided by ‘inherited information’ rather\nthan ‘environmental\ninformation.’ Lorenz defined\n‘information’ in terms of adaptation. An adaptive trait\n‘fits’ its environment and hence can be said to contain\ninformation about that environment just as a key can be said to\ncontain information about the lock it will open. The question is where\nthat information comes from – how does the organism\n‘know’ about its environment? If a woman has calluses on\nher palms rather than on the backs of her hands, this represents\ninformation about where her skin gets rubbed most. If she\nwere born with\ncalluses on her palms, as Ostriches are born with calluses that match\npressure points on their legs, this would imply advance\n‘knowledge’ of where her skin is going to be rubbed\nmost. Such anticipatory information, Lorenz argued, must be in the\ngenome. It is in the genome as a result of natural selection, which\ncan be seen as a form of trial-and-error learning. \n\nLorenz's analysis can readily be expressed in information-theoretic\nterms, with the environment as the signal source and the organism as\nthe receiver. Organisms need to reduce their uncertainty about what\ndemands the environment will place on them and to develop in a way\nthat meets those demands. There are two ways to do this. The first way\nis to gather information about the environment during development. The\nwater flea Daphnia pulex monitors chemical traces of\npredators as it develops. If an individual flea detects evidence that\npredators are present, then that flea grows defensive armor. Thus, a\nflea's possession or lack of defensive armour reflects\nenvironmental information. The alternative is to inherit information\nfrom your ancestors. The human sickle cell allele has harmful effects\nin homozygotes and survives in a population only because it confers\nresistance to malaria in heterozygotes. Hence the fact that an\nindividual carries the allele provides information about the\nprevalence of malaria in the ancestral environment and thus, probably,\nin the environment of the organism which inherits the allele. The\nsickle cell allele can thus be seen as passing on information about\nthe environment which was ‘learnt’ by ancestors through\nnatural selection. To the extent that the functional adjustment of a\ntrait to its environment is explained by ‘inherited\ninformation’ of this kind, Lorenz argued, the trait is\ninnate. Hence, albeit in a very different way from Tinbergen, Lorenz\nalso came to see whether a behavior is an adaptation as the key\nissue. Writing in the 1960s Lorenz naturally assumed that genes were\nthe only source of inherited information. It is now known that much\ninformation about the environment is transmitted from parent to\noffspring via epigenetic signals, such as methylation patterns on the\nDNA or RNAs from the mother included in the egg. For example, if a\nfemale water flea detects predators and grows defensive armor, its\noffspring will develop armor even if they do not detect any evidence\nof predators themselves.  Lorenz's theory would imply that traits\nproduced in this way are also innate, since they reflect inherited\ninformation, albeit epigenetically rather than genetically\ninherited. \n\nClassical ethology flourished in the years immediately following\nWorld War Two (Burkhardt 2005). At the same time others started to\nquestion the emphasis on environmental factors in behavioral\ndevelopment which had developed between the wars. Numerous lines of\nevidence suggested that psychology would have to take account of\nspecies-specific biological endowments if it was to understand how\ndifferent species interact with their environment and the distinctive\nthings each species is able to learn from these interactions (e.g.\nHarlow 1953; Tomkins 1962; Seligman 1970). By far the most influential\ncriticism of behaviorism, however, came from linguistics. The linguist\nNoam Chomsky argued that existing behaviorist accounts of the\ndevelopment of language were unworkable and offered a general argument\nfor the conclusion that the ability to acquire language is innate\n(Chomsky 1957; Chomsky 1959; Chomsky 1966). According to this\n‘poverty of the stimulus’ argument, the examples of speech\nto which children are exposed do not contain enough evidence to settle\nwhich utterances are grammatical in the language they are trying to\nacquire. Nevertheless, children reliably acquire the grammar of their\nnative language. Therefore, Chomsky and his followers concluded,\nchildren must have innate knowledge about grammar which supplements the\nevidence to which they are exposed during development. If this argument\nis sound, every normal childhood is a deprivation experiment that\nconfirms the innateness of grammar. The details of the original poverty\nof the stimulus argument, its elaboration by Chomsky's followers,\nand the current state of the evidence for linguistic nativism are\ndiscussed in detail in the entry\n Innateness and Language.\n I will not\nrepeat them here. What matters for my purposes is that Chomsky's\nwork produced a very broad consensus in psychology that language\nacquisition is explained by a complex, evolved mechanism that is\npresent at birth and which can produce normal linguistic development in\na wide range of environments, including those which are\n‘impoverished’ with respect to language. \n\nThe ‘language acquisition device’ has served as an\nexemplar for research on whether other psychological and behavioral\ntraits are innate. Like the language acquisition device these\nputatively innate traits are supposed to explain patterns in the\ndevelopment of the child's mind. These patterns can be seen as\nrepresenting innate ‘knowledge’ or innate\n‘theories’ about various cognitive domains. For example,\nthe eminent cognitive developmental psychologists Susan Carey and\nElizabeth Spelke argue that children possess four domains of innate\n‘core knowledge’ which underlie much of their later\ncognitive development. These domains are ‘objects, agents,\nnumbers and space’ (Carey and Spelke 1996, 517). Children think\nabout each of these four domains in distinctive ways that do not seem\nto depend on the details of the child's environment. The\ndistinctive way in which children think about living, as opposed to\ninanimate, entities has also been proposed as a domain of innate\nknowledge (e.g. Medin and Atran 2004). The recent philosophical\nliterature on the concept of innateness which is outlined in later\nsections of this entry is mostly intended to analyse innateness as it\nis understood in this extensive body of ‘neo-nativist’\npsychology (for a thorough introduction to this field and the\ncontroversies arising from it, see Carruthers, Laurence et al.\n2005–9). \n\nIt may have struck some readers as odd that this brief sketch of the\nhistory of the innate/acquired distinction in 20th century\nscience has concentrated on behavioural biology and psychology and\nbarely touched on genetics. The next two sections deal with behavioral\ngenetics and molecular genetics respectively, and make clear how\ntenuous the connections are between these fields and the\ninnate/acquired distinction. \n\nPopular discussion of whether psychological and behavioural traits\nare innate is bedevilled by the conflation of this issue with whether\npsychological and behavioural traits are heritable.\n‘Heritability’ is a quantity calculated by behavioural\ngeneticists, with values between 0 and 1. Heritability scores for\nsocially significant behaviors are regularly reported in the media.\nPeople who do not know how these numbers are calculated typically\nunderstand a score like the 0.49 reported for the mental disorder of\nschizophrenia to mean that this disorder is 49% innate, or innate in\n49% of the people who suffer from it. To see why this is a mistake,\nconsider these two facts: 1. In a population of genetically identical\nindividuals, all traits have a heritability of zero. But it is absurd\nto suppose that my IQ would change from innate to acquired if I left a\npopulation of normal human beings and joined a population of my clones.\n2. Providing equal access to education for all children in a community\nwill increase the heritability of IQ in that community. So if\nheritability were a measure of innateness, then using education to\nincrease IQ would also be a way to make IQ more innate, which is\nobviously absurd. \n\nThe measures of heritability used in behavioural genetics, and in\nquantitative genetics more generally, are not and do not pretend to be\nmeasures of whether the traits of individual organisms owe more to the\ngenes or more to the environment. Instead, they report the results of\nan important but highly unintuitive statistical technique called the\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA). This technique and the measures of\nheritability it generates are explained in the entry\n Heredity and Heritability.\n In very simple\nterms, however, we can say that heritability analysis asks how many of\nthe pairwise differences between all individuals in a population can be\ncorrelated with genetic differences between each pair of individuals,\nand how many can be correlated with differences in the environment of\neach pair of individuals. That is why in our example above making\npeople more genetically similar reduces heritability, because\nthere are proportionally fewer genetic differences to correlate with any\nphenotypic differences. Conversely, making the environment more uniform\nincreases heritability because there are proportionally fewer\nenvironmental differences to correlate with any phenotypic\ndifferences. \n\nBut although heritability is in no way a measure of innateness, this\ndoes not mean that it is irrelevant to the distinction between innate\nand acquired characteristics. The fact that traits are highly heritable\nhas been used to argue that those traits cannot be changed by changing\nthe environment, the issue at the heart of people's concerns when\nthey ask whether a trait such as IQ or sexual orientation is innate.\nThe argument connecting heritability to environmental malleability is\nsimple. It starts with the assumption that trait differences are caused\nby the factors with which they correlate, an assumption I will not\nquestion here. Suppose that most differences between individuals in a\npopulation with respect to some trait are correlated with genetic\ndifferences and very few are correlated with differences in\nenvironment, which is simply to say that the trait is highly heritable.\nSurely, this implies that changing the environment will have little\neffect on the pattern of differences. For example, making the\nenvironments of all the individuals the same would not eliminate all\nthe differences between them, because we have postulated that most of\nthose differences were caused by genetic differences and those\ndifferences are still there. \n\nBut things are not that simple. The effect of a genetic difference\non a trait sometimes depends on the environment. In that case, changing\nthe environment can eliminate a difference caused by a gene. To take a\nsimple but not unrealistic example, suppose that a gene produces an\nenzyme which only works below a certain temperature. If two individuals\nonly one of whom has this gene are raised in environments below that\ncritical temperature, then one will show the effects of the enzyme and\nthe other will not. But if the two individuals are raised in\nenvironments above the critical temperature, then there will be no\ndifference between them. So in this case, changing the environment\neliminates a difference caused by a gene. In other cases, changing a\ngene can eliminate a difference caused by the environment. Effects like\nthese show up in heritability analyses as statistical interactions\nbetween genes and environment, meaning that how heritable the trait is\ndepends on the specific distribution of environments across the\npopulation. One practical implication of gene-environment interaction\neffects is that when they occur, heritability scores cannot be\nextrapolated from one population to another. A trait can show high\nheritability in one population, but low heritability in another.\nAnother practical implication is that high heritability does not imply\nthat changing the environment will not eliminate the differences\nbetween individuals (nor does low heritability imply that genetic\nmanipulation cannot eliminate those differences.) \n\nStatistical interactions between genes and environment are\nwell-documented in behavioural genetic studies on animals (Fuller,\nSarkar et al. 2005). Whether this lesson can be extrapolated to human\nbehaviour, and why or why not, is the subject of a set of interlocking\ncontroversies which are too intricate to pursue here. There is an\nextensive philosophical literature on these controversies and their\nhistory. Some recent contributions which include citations of the\nrelevant scientific literatures include: (Kaplan 2000; Sesardic 2005;\nSchaffner 2006a; Schaffner 2006b; Griffiths and Tabery 2008). \n\nDuring the 2008 US presidential election journalists frequently\nreferred to a candidate's characteristic beliefs or attitudes as\n‘part of their political DNA’. This is an example of how in\ncontemporary English ‘in the DNA’ or ‘in the\ngenes’ has come to replace older phrases like ‘in the\nblood’. But if genetics can be used to elucidate the\ninnate/acquired distinction it is certainly not because some traits,\nthe innate ones, are caused by the genes whilst others, the acquired\nones, are caused by the environment. While the difference\nbetween two individuals can be caused by a genetic or an environmental\ndifference between them, the development of any trait in an individual\ndepends on both genes and environment. Every aspect of development,\nincluding learning, consists in the regulated expression of the genome.\nConversely, innumerable aspects of the environment are required at each\nstage in the life of the organism to keep development on its normal\ncourse, or, in other words, to ensure that the right genes are\nexpressed in the right cells at the right time. Thus, all traits\ndevelop through the interaction of genome and environment. Philip\nKitcher has referred to this as the ‘interactionist\nconsensus’ (Kitcher 2001). \n\nBut if all traits depend on genes, it may still be that some traits\ndepend on them in a special way. If asked about phrases like ‘in\nthe DNA’ or ‘in the genes’, most people would\nprobably refer to the idea that the genes contain instructions or a\nprogram. After all, everyone knows that there is a genetic code, so it\nmust be coding for something. Perhaps genes ‘code\nfor’ innate traits but not for acquired ones. However, as Peter\nGodfrey-Smith has noted, ‘All the genes can code for, if they\ncode for anything, is the primary structure (amino acid sequence) of a\nprotein’ (Godfrey-Smith 1999, 328). Considered as a language, the\ngenetic code can only refer to the twenty-three standard amino acids\nand can only say which order to put them in. The only exceptions to\nthis are the ‘start’ and ‘stop’ codons which\naffect where DNA transcription begins and ends. Many other things\nhappen as a downstream causal consequence of the order of amino acids,\nbut to paraphrase Godfrey Smith's argument, genes do not\n‘code for’ these downstream causal consequences for the\nsame reason that President Nixon's order to cover up the\nWatergate scandal was not an ‘order’ to get him impeached\nby Congress. ‘Coding for’, like ‘ordering’ and\nother semantic locutions, is not merely another name for\n‘causing’. The idea that the ‘genetic program’\nor ‘genetic instructions’ for phenotypes are literally\nwritten in the genetic code is a continuing barrier to the public\nunderstanding of genetics, one that is reinforced every time a\njournalist reports that scientists have ‘decoded’ the gene\nfor something. In reality there are no tiny ‘traitunculi’\nhidden in the genome awaiting a sufficiently powerful genetic\nmicroscope to read them (Schaffner 1998). \n\nBut although the sequences of nucleotides in the genome do not\nliterally ‘code for’ phenotypic traits, they are, of\ncourse, amongst the causes of phenotypic traits. Several philosophers\nand scientists have introduced senses of ‘genetic\ninformation’ based on these causal relationships in order to\nexplicate the intuitive idea that genes carry information about\nphenotypes. These proposals are discussed in more detail in the\n entry\n Biological information.\n Here I\nwill simply make two points about these proposals. The first point is\nthat there are some very straightforward senses in which genes\n‘carry information’ about phenotypes. The human Y\nchromosome carries information about sex in the same way that\n‘smoke means fire’: one can be predicted from the other. In\naddition, the SRY region on the Y-chromosome is an adaptation for\nmaking organisms into males, so we can apply a version of\n‘teleosemantics’, an approach which defines information in\nterms of adaptation, to this piece of DNA (Millikan 1984; Sterelny,\nDickison et al. 1996 and see the entry on \n teleological theories of mental content).\n The second point is that these straightforward senses of\n‘information’ also seem to be applicable to environmental\ncauses in development (Oyama 1985; Griffiths and Gray 1997; Griffiths\nand Knight 1998; Griffiths and Gray 2005). Mammals have a chromosomal\nsystem of sex-determination. But many reptiles use temperature, an\nenvironmental signal, to switch genetically identical eggs between male\nor female developmental pathways. Other reptiles have a genetic system\nwhich can be overridden by an environmental signal. Some fish even\nswitch sex in adulthood in response to environmental cues. These\nenvironmental signals carry information about sex in the unproblematic\n‘smoke means fire’ sense. Moreover, the behaviours that\nparents use to give appropriate cues to their eggs, and some of the\nproducts of those behaviours, such as nests of rotting vegetation which\nmaintain a suitable temperature range, are designed by natural\nselection to ensure the correct sex-ratio in offspring, so the\nteleosemantic program can be applied to them too. The idea that genes\n‘carry information’ about phenotypes in a special sense\nwhich distinguishes them from other causes is not the piece of\ncommon-sense it is often taken to be, but rather a highly contested\nidea that is the focus of current research in the philosophy of biology\n(Oyama 1985, Maynard Smith 2000, Griffiths 2001, Robert 2004). \n\nIf all traits are caused by both genetic and environmental factors,\nthen reconstructing the innate/acquired distinction in genetic terms\nmeans distinguishing different ways in which genes interact\nwith the environment. The pattern of interaction between gene and\nenvironment is commonly represented using ‘norms of\nreaction’ — graphical representations of a phenotypic variable as\na function of genotypic and environmental variables. These diagrams\nwere introduced at around the same time as the idea of the gene and the\ndistinction between genotype and phenotype (Sarkar 1999) and have long\nbeen advocated as the clearest way to think about the role of genes in\ndevelopment (Hogben 1933; Lewontin 1974; Gottlieb 1995; Kitcher 2001).\nSuppose, for example, that with respect to some environmental variable\n(E) an organism with a given genotype (G1) will develop the same\nphenotype (P) way no matter what value the environmental variable takes\n(Figure 1). \n\nIf a norm of reaction has this shape, we can say that P is\n‘genetically determined’ even though it has an\nenvironmental factor as one of its causes. Philip Kitcher suggests that\nsome norms of reaction may have this form, but only in some limited,\nbut perhaps contextually important, range of environments (Kitcher\n2001). For example, a disease caused by the loss of one or both normal\ncopies of a gene might develop in every environment except\nthose specifically structured as clinical interventions to cure the\ndisease. \n\nAnother norm of reaction is one in which genetic and environmental\nfactors interact ‘additively’ (Figure 2). Genotype makes a\nconstant difference across some range of environment. While\nthe genetic variable does not determine the actual value of the trait\nin each individual, it does determine the differences between\nindividuals. Moreover, when the norms of reaction have this form,\nheritability scores become relevant to the question of whether and how\nmuch a phenotype can be altered by environmental intervention, as\ndiscussed in the previous section. A famous diagram in the early days\nof behaviour genetics depicted the relationship between IQ (P),\ngenotype (G) and the ‘enrichment’ of the environment (E) as\nhaving roughly this form (Gottesman 1963a). If correct, this would mean\nthat educational enrichment would cause everyone to get higher test\nscores, but would not change the ordering of their scores. \n\nIn perhaps the most famous paper on this topic the geneticist\nRichard Lewontin (1974) argued that actual norms of reaction are likely\nto be non-additive (Figure 3). In that case, it makes no sense to talk\nof a particular genotype ‘determining’ a phenotypic\ndifference. Genotype and environment jointly determine the\noutcome in the straightforward sense that the effect of each factor on\nthe outcome is a function of the particular value taken by the other\nfactor. Whether norms of reaction are typically non-additive and\nexactly what this implies is the subject of an extensive scientific and\nphilosophical literature on ‘gene-environment interaction’, as\ndiscussed in the previous section. \n\nPhilip Kitcher has argued that ‘genetic determinism’\nshould be understood as the claim that many norms of reaction have\nroughly the ‘determinist’ shapes depicted in Figures 1 and\n2 (for an alternative view, see Griffiths 2006). In Section 4.3 I\ndiscuss a recent proposal to define ‘innate’ in the same\nspirit. \n\nRecent philosophical analyses of the innate/acquired distinction can\nbe classified into four types. The first identifies innate traits with\nthose characteristic of an entire species and acquired traits with\nthose that vary between populations and individuals. A second type of\nanalysis identifies innate traits with those that can be explained by\nnatural selection. The third, and currently most influential,\ndistinguishes different patterns of interaction between genes and\nenvironment and identifies one pattern with the innate and another with\nthe acquired. A fourth, quite different, type of analysis suggests that\nlabeling a trait ‘innate’ is a way to indicate that it lies\noutside the domain of psychology. \n\nIn his seminal paper ‘The idea of innateness’ (1975)\nStephen Stich made a number of tentative suggestions about the\nstructure of the innateness concept. One was that an innate trait\nmight be defined as a trait an organism will manifest in the normal\ncourse of development. But Stich himself offered a counterexample to\nthis analysis: universally held beliefs, such as the belief that water\nquenches thirst, will count as innate traits on this analysis, which\nseems counterintuitive (Stich 1975, p. 9). André Ariew has\noffered another counterexample: humans acquire a typical gut flora\nduring development, but these bacteria are intuitively an acquired\ntrait rather than an innate trait (Ariew 1999, p. 133). Ariew suggests\nthat Stich's analysis confuses evidence for innateness with innateness\nitself. Universality is evidence for the existence of a particular\nkind of developmental mechanism (Ariew 2006, p. 10, and see 4.3\nbelow). A recent empirical study, however, suggests that universality\ninfluences judgments of innateness independently of beliefs about\ndevelopmental mechanisms (Griffiths, Machery & Linquist,\nforthcoming), so Stich's analysis may still have something to\noffer to an understanding of the innateness concept. Additional\nsupport for this view comes from the fact that a number of scientific\nauthors have used the term ‘innate’ to mean ‘shared\nby all members of the species’ (Bateson 1991; Mameli and Bateson\n2006). \n\nWe have already encountered the suggestion that a trait is innate if\nits development is guided by ‘inherited information’\nrather than ‘environmental information’ (Lorenz 1966;\nBrowne 2005 (Other Internet Resources); see Section 1 above). A\nsimilar analysis was independently suggested by Stich (1975,\n13–16). The first hurdle for any analysis along these lines, Stich\nnoted, is to specify what is meant by ‘information’ (Stich\n1975, p.  15). As we have seen above, Lorenz identified\n‘information’ in this context with adaptive fit. In\nessence his ‘inherited information’ analysis amounts to\nthe claim that a trait is innate if its fit to the environment can\nonly be explained by evolutionary adaptation. \n\nStich's 1975 suggestion has been elaborated and defended by\nMuhammad Ali Khalidi who like Stich seems not to\nhave encountered Lorenz's work (Khalidi 2002; Khalidi 2007). Both\nStich and Khalidi restrict the analysis to innate cognitive\ntraits, although it seems clear from Lorenz's work that it can be\nmade general. Khalidi presents his analysis in terms of the\n‘poverty of the stimulus’ argument outlined in Section 1\nabove : ‘…a belief (concept, idea, capacity) may be\nconsidered to be innate to the degree that it would emerge as the\nresult of an impoverished stimulus’ (Khalidi\n2002, p. 269). However, he goes on to define impoverishment as\n‘informational impoverishment’ which is in turn defined as\na gap between the information in the developmental environment and the\ninformation manifested in the trait that develops in that environment\n(e.g. Khalidi 2007, 100). Khalidi admits that severe difficulties stand\nin the way of actually measuring the information content of\ndevelopmental environments and capacities. He suggests, however, that\nscientists have rough-and-ready ways to assess the informational gap,\nusing various forms of deprivation experiment (see Section 1\nabove). \n\nIt is unclear whether Khalidi would endorse Lorenz's analysis\nof information and of the significance of the deprivation experiment.\nAccording to Lorenz, a trait contains more ‘information’\nthan its developmental environment if the functional adjustment of the\ntrait to the environment cannot be explained by the developmental\nenvironment. The deprivation experiment is designed to eliminate just\nthose factors that could explain the trait's functional\nadjustment to the environment. Khalidi makes no reference to the\nadaptive value of innate traits, and like Stich he thinks that the idea\nof innateness should be applicable to disease phenotypes as well as to\nfunctional phenotypes (Khalidi 2007, 97). But Khalidi's idea of\nan informational gap between the developmental environment and the\ninnate trait seems rather problematic in the case of innate diseases.\nIs the normal developmental environment of the human child\n‘informationally impoverished’ relative to the cognitive\ndeficits seen in Trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)? What information\nis manifest in a child born anencephalic and thus, presumably, with no\ncognitive traits at all? I suggest that without the additional\nresources offered by the concept of adaptation Khalidi's concept\nof ‘information’ would collapse into a simple notion of\ncovariance, and his analysis of innateness would be a version of the\ncanalisation analysis discussed in the next section. \n\nAndre Ariew has published an influential series of papers (1996;\n1999; 2006) arguing that the concept of an innate trait can be\nexplicated using the idea of ‘developmental canalization’.\nThis concept was introduced by the influential mid-20th\ncentury embryologist and theoretical biologist Conrad H. Waddington\n(1940; 1942; 1957; 1959). \n\nDevelopmental canalization was part of a broader vision of how an\norganism develops from the fertilized egg. The entire collection of\ngenes and their interactions makes up a ‘developmental\nsystem’ (Waddington 1952) which produces a phenotype. Many\nfeatures of the phenotype are explained by the dynamical properties of\nthat developmental system as a whole, rather than by the influence of\none or a few specific alleles. Thus, for example, Waddington sought to\nexplain one of the major biological discoveries of his day – the\nfact that extreme phenotypic uniformity can be observed in many wild\npopulations despite extensive genetic variation in those same\npopulations – by appealing to the global dynamics of\ndevelopmental systems. A genetically canalized developmental system\ntakes development to the same endpoint from many different genetic\nstarting points. The development of wild-type phenotypes can thus be\nbuffered against genetic variation. Waddington represented this idea\nwith his famous ‘developmental landscape’ (Figure 4). \n  \n  \nFigure 4. Waddington's developmental landscape (A) and its\nunderpinnings (B) (Waddington 1957, 29 & 36, reproduced with\npermission)\n \n\nThe ‘developmental landscape’ is a representation of\ndevelopment as a system whose parameters are genetic loci and whose\nstate space is a set of phenotypic states. The state space is depicted\nas a surface, each point of which represents a phenotype. The genetic\nparameters are depicted as pegs that pull on the surface and thus\ndetermine its contours. Epistatic interactions between genetic loci are\nrepresented by links between the strings by which those loci pull on\nthe surface. The development of the organism is represented by the\ntrajectory over the surface of a ball which passes through a series of\nphenotypic states as it rolls ‘downhill’ from conception to\ndeath. Waddington intended this diagram to make vivid the idea that the\neffect of a change at one genetic locus depends upon the states of all\nthe other genetic loci, since it is all the loci together which\ndetermine the shape of the landscape. Some genetic changes, such as\nthose which affect the tops of inaccessible ‘hills,’ will\nhave no effect on development. Other changes of the same intrinsic\ngenomic magnitude which affect the entrance of a valley or\n‘canal’ will have a massive effect on development. The\nphenotypic impact of a genetic change is not proportional to the\nmagnitude of the genomic change, but depends on the structure of the\ndevelopmental system. Furthermore, the phenotypic difference produced\nby a genetic difference is not explained by that genetic difference in\nitself, but by how that change interacts with the rest of the\ndevelopmental system. This picture retains considerably validity in the\nlight of contemporary developmental genetics. \n\nIf we suppose that some of the ‘pegs’ in\nWaddington's model are environmental factors, rather than genetic\nloci, then we can define separate notions of ‘environmental\ncanalisation’ and ‘genetic canalisation’. A\nphenotypic outcome is environmentally canalised if those features of\nthe surface which direct development to that endpoint are relatively\ninsensitive to the manipulation of the environmental parameters. A\nphenotypic outcome is genetically canalised if those features of the\nsurface which direct development to that endpoint are relatively\ninsensitive to the manipulation of the genetic parameters. Ariew\nproposes to identify innateness with environmental\ncanalization. Innateness-as-canalization is a matter of degree. A trait\nis more innate the more environmental parameters its development is\nbuffered against and the wider the range of variation in those\nparameters against which it is buffered. \n\nGriffiths and Machery have offered a counterexample to\nAriew's analysis (Griffiths and Machery 2008). The developmental\npsychobiologist Celia Moore showed that the spinal cord nuclei of male\nrats differ from those of female rats in ways that allow the male to\nuse his penis during copulation (Moore 1984; Moore 1992). These neural\ndifferences result from differences in gene expression in the\ndeveloping spinal cord of the rat pup, which in turn result from\ndifferences in the amount of licking of the genital area by the mother,\nwhich in turn results from greater expression in male pups of a\nchemical that elicits maternal licking. According to Ariew's\ncharacterization of innateness as canalization, these experiments show\nthat the rat's ability to copulate is not innate: \n\nThe rat's ability to copulate depends on an environmental\ncondition that is found everywhere the system develops and so,\naccording to Ariew, it is not innate. But intuitively the rat's\nability to copulate is innate. Griffiths and Machery argue\nthat this intuition results from the fact that the ability to copulate\nis an evolutionary adaptation and universal in male rats. Additional\ncounterexamples can be constructed using this formula. \n\nHowever, Ariew has argued, and his critics accept, that the\nexistence of intuitive counterexamples is not really to the point. His\nanalysis is not meant to capture what everyday speakers of English mean\nby the word ‘innate’, although it obviously has some\ncontinuity with what they mean. Instead, the analysis is meant to\nexplicate a research strategy used by scientists like Chomsky. The use\nof terms like ‘innate’ and ‘instinct’ by these\nscientists should be interpreted in the context of this research\nstrategy, which Ariew calls ‘biologicising the mind’ (Ariew\n2006). ‘Biologicising the mind’ means analysing the\ndevelopment of a psychological or behavioral trait on the model of\nparadigmatically ‘biological’ traits such as legs and\nlivers. According to Ariew, canalised development is the hallmark of\nthe development of these paradigmatically biological traits, and the\nresearch programs of scientists like Chomsky should be seen as attempts\nto demonstrate the canalised development of psychological traits. \n\nOther recent contributors to the philosophical literature on\ninnateness have adopted a similar methodological stance. Ron Mallon and\nJonathan Weinberg argue that much neo-nativist psychology can be seen\nas an investigation into psychological traits that are ‘closed\nprocess invariant’ (Mallon and Weinberg 2006). This means that\nthey develop in all normal environments (the ‘invariance\ncondition’) as the result of a set of developmental mechanisms\nthat are only capable of producing one or a few developmental outcomes\nacross a wide range of possible environments (the ‘closed process\ncondition’). Mallon and Weinberg suggest that their account of\ninnateness applies to paradigmatically biological traits such as legs\nand livers, so ‘closed process invariantism’ can be seen as\nanother attempt to elucidate the strategy of ‘biologicising the\nmind’. \n\nMallon and Weinberg's account is supposed to count examples\nlike the penile reflexes of the rat described above as innate because\nthey are produced by a ‘closed process’ – one that\ncan only produce one or a few possible outcomes. The idea of a closed\nprocess remains in need of further elaboration. Mallon and Weinberg\nthemselves are concerned about how to individuate developmental\nprocesses. They do not want early, general phases of development like\nthe closure of the neural tube to count as part of the development of\nspecific traits like language. Another significant hurdle for the\naccount is to provide individuation criteria for developmental\noutcomes. If the outcomes in the previous example are classified simply\nas ‘functional penis’ or ‘non-functional\npenis,’ then the example involves a closed process. If we attend\nto the details of the nerve ganglia of the rat's spinal cord,\ndifferent outcomes can be distinguished, resulting from different\namounts of maternal licking and it becomes an open process. While this\nmay seem somewhat artificial in this case, it is entirely natural when\ndealing with a quantitative phenotype such as the ‘stress\nreactivity’ phenotype in highly analogous work on maternal care\nin the rat by Michael J. Meaney and collaborators (Meaney 2001a; Meaney\n2001b and see below). \n\nFiona Cowie (1999) and Richard Samuels (2002) have taken a rather\ndifferent approach to the innateness concept. Cowie argues that the\nterm ‘innate’ has been used by a number of significant\nfigures in the history of psychology to indicate that the development\nof a trait does not involve the kinds of processes the study of which\nis distinctive of psychology. Samuels has suggested that this is the\nbest explication of the concept of innateness in contemporary\nneo-nativist psychology. On this account innate traits are those which\nmust be explained by developmental biologists rather than psychologists\nand which for this reason can legitimately be treated as primitives in\npsychological explanation (for this reason the approach is referred to\nas ‘primitivism’ about innateness). Primitivism becomes a\nmore substantive thesis if it is linked to an account of the nature of\npsychological explanation, or perhaps of psychological explanation as\nconceived in the neo-nativist tradition. \n\nThere is an obvious symmetry between ‘primitivism’ and\nAriew's ‘biologicising the mind’. Ariew suggests that\ninnateness guides research by embodying a strategy of investigating\npsychological traits as if they were paradigmatically biological traits\nlike hearts and hair. Cowie and Samuels suggest that innateness guides\nresearch by embodying a strategy of not investigating a trait as if it\nwere a paradigmatically psychological trait like a belief or a phobia,\nbut instead treating it as a boundary condition in psychological\nexplanations of related traits. These two ‘strategies’\nwould seem to be complementary. \n\nWhile neo-nativism thrives in contemporary psychology and cognitive\nscience, there is a strong sceptical tradition concerning the\ninnate/acquired distinction in other areas of the sciences of mind and\nbehavior. The incorporation of Lehrman's critique of Lorenz into\nthe ethological tradition had a lasting impact on animal behaviour\nresearch. After a half-century of research on the development of\nbirdsong the doyen of researchers in that field, Peter Marler sums up\nhis view of innateness like this: \n\nOther leading animal behaviour researchers see even this casual use\nof the distinction as pernicious. One concern is that the term\n‘innate’ has no definite meaning and hence leads to\nfallacies of ambiguity. Ethologist Patrick Bateson urges researchers to\n“Say what you mean (even if it uses a bit more space) rather than\nunintentionally confuse your readers by employing a word such as innate\nthat carries so many different connotations” (Bateson 1991, p.\n22). Matteo Mameli and Bateson have recently systematically reviewed\nthe scientific use of the term ‘innate’ and identified no less than\ntwenty-six proposed definitions. They judge eight of these to be both\ngenuinely independent definitions and potentially valuable scientific\nconstructs (Mameli and Bateson 2006, p. 177–8). Unless it can be\ndemonstrated that the eight properties picked out by these definitions\nare highly correlated with one another, something which they doubt on\nempirical grounds, the term ‘innate’ is confusing and\nunhelpful. \n\nSceptics also question whether there really is even a rough\n‘lability continuum’ as Marler suggests. Several recent\nphilosophical defenders of the innateness concept suggest in a spirit\nof common sense that whatever the limitations of the concept, traits\ncan at least be placed along a rough continuum of dependence on the\nenvironment (e.g. Ariew 2006; Mallon and Weinberg 2006; Khalidi 2007).\nBut this does not seem like common sense to many scientists who\nactually study behavioral development. Developmental psychobiology is a\nfield that grew out of the research tradition of which Lehrman was part\n(for a textbook treatment see Michel and Moore 1995; two excellent\npopular introductions are Bateson and Martin 1999, and Moore 2001). The\nconsensus in this field is that experimental research on the\ndevelopment of a trait typically reveals sensitive dependence on\nenvironmental parameters. These parameters are highly varied, and they\ninteract non-additively with genetic parameters. The idea of a\n‘lability continuum’ seems implausible to researchers in\nthis tradition both because there is no single set of parameters with\nwhich to compare different species, and because the idea of\npartitioning developmental causation between genes and environment in\nthe case of a single species is subject to the formal objections\narising from non-additive interaction discussed in Sections 2 and 3\nabove (on this last point see Meaney 2001a; Suomi 2003). \n\nDevelopmental psychobiologists reject a basic idea at the heart of\nmuch discussion of innateness, which is that evolution makes\ndevelopment reliable by making it insensitive to environmental\nparameters. Instead, they argue that evolution often makes development\nreliable by stabilizing environmental parameters at the right value or\nby exploiting pre-existing environmental regularities. The birdsong\nresearchers Meredith West and Andrew King have described this as\nlocating development in an ‘ontogenetic niche’ and research\nin developmental psychobiology can be conceived as the study of this\nniche and its interaction with the genome. West and King and their\ncollaborators have conducted a long term study of the ontogenetic niche\nof the brown-headed cowbird Molothrus Ater (West and King\n1987; West and King 1988; West, King et al. 2006). Cowbirds are\nobligate nest parasites (like cuckoos) and do not hear their parents\nsing as they grow up. It was therefore assumed that they sing\n‘innately’. West and King showed that, amongst other\nprocesses, male song is shaped by feedback from female cowbirds, whose\nwing stroking and gaping displays in response to the songs they prefer\nare strong reinforcers for males. Female song preferences are\nthemselves subject to social influences. As a result of these and other\nprocesses cowbirds reliably transmit not only species-typical song, but\nalso the regional song dialects typical of birds that acquire their\nsongs as a result of exposure to parental song. In stark contrast to\nthe suggestions of the philosophers discussed in Section 4.3 the\nresearchers conclude that asking whether cowbird song is innate or\nacquired is unhelpful because it demands that the developmental process\nbe assimilated to one of two prototypes, neither of which is suitable\n(West, King et al. 1990). \n\nIn many species, of course, the stabilization of the parameters of\nthe ontogenetic niche is achieved through parental care, as we saw in\nthe case of the development of penile reflexes in the rat in Section\n4.3. But parental care can also be used as a mechanism of adaptive\nphenotypic plasticity. Michael Meaney and collaborators' account\nof the role of parental care in the development of temperament in rats\nis a good exemplar of this phenomenon. The BALBc strain of laboratory\nrat is “highly fearful, and maze dull…these animals show\nincreased endocrine and behavioral responses to stress, they are\nhyperactive and show profound learning and memory deficits that are\nassociated with, among things, impaired hippocampal development”\n(Meaney, 2001, 57). Cross-fostering BALBc pups to mothers of the more\nlaid-back C57 strain removes the differences between the two strains.\nMeaney and collaborators show how the amount of licking and arched-back\nnursing which pups receive from their mother regulates gene expression\nso as to direct the development of the pup's brain (Meaney,\n2001). Although the phenotypes of these inbred laboratory strains are\nconstant, it is plausible that in wild rats maternal behavior reflects\nthe mother's stress levels. It may convey information to the pup\nabout the likely quality of its environment and ‘preset’\nstress metabolism to match that environment. This work reinforces\nanother lesson of developmental psychobiology, which is that the\nrelevant aspects of the ontogenetic niche are\n‘non-obvious’. We might guess that the rat pup will respond\nto indicators of environmental quality, and we might guess that the\nmother's behavior is a useful source of information on this\ntopic, but not that the information resides in whether the mother\narches her back during suckling. Non-obvious parameters are typically\noverlooked in deprivation experiments designed to establish that a\ntrait is innate, but are often revealed by positive efforts to\nunderstand how behaviour develops (Gottlieb 1997). \n\nDevelopmental psychobiologists have an evolutionary rationale for\nthe existence of the ‘ontogenetic niche’. Natural selection\ndoes not select for mechanisms which buffer traits against variation in\nthe environment unless variation of that kind regularly occurs in the\nenvironments in which the species lives. In fact, any buffering\nmechanism which is not actively being used will tend to decay by\nmutation. One famous example is the inability of humans and their\nrelatives to synthesise ascorbic acid (vitamin C). The ascorbic acid\nsynthesis pathway was disabled by mutation during the long period in\nwhich our fruit-eating ancestors had no chance of developing vitamin C\ndeficiences (Jukes and King 1975). As Terence Deacon has nicely put it,\norganisms are ‘addicted to’ innumerable aspects of their\nenvironments, from ascorbic acid, to gravity, to social interactions\n(Deacon 1997). Selection will also favour behaviours that allow animals\nto reliably ‘feed their addictions’. \n\nRecent philosophical scepticism about the concept of innateness\ninspired by this research tradition can be seen in the work of\nGriffiths and collaborators (Griffiths 2002; Griffiths and Machery\n2008; Griffiths, Machery & Linquist, forthcoming). These\nresearchers have argued that the idea of an innate trait is simply one\nexpression of a folkbiological theory of the ‘natures’ of\nliving things. Just as there are commonsense ideas about physical\nobjects and the forces acting on them (‘folk physics’), so\nthere are commonsense ideas about biology (‘folkbiology’\n— Medin and Atran 1999). It is part of folkbiology that some\ntraits are expressions of the inner nature of animals and plants,\nwhilst other traits result from the influence of the\nenvironment. Echoing the traditional critique of the innateness\nconcept in animal behaviour research, Griffiths and collaborators\nargue that folkbiology conflates the issues of whether a trait is\ntypical of the species, whether it is part of the design of the\nspecies, and whether its development is insensitive to the\nenvironment. Attempts to redefine innateness in a way that stresses\njust one of its many aspects and thus makes it a useful scientific\nconstruct have been and will continue to be stymied by the fact that\nthe broad concept of innateness is part of our evolved psychological\nequipment. \n\nRecent philosophical discussion of the innate/acquired distinction\nhas been driven by the desire to make sense of innateness claims in\nneo-nativist psychology. Philosophical defenders of the innate/acquired\ndistinction typically refer to its value for research in linguistics\nand psychology, and to the success of this research. It may be that\nresolving the disputes between the many competing analyses of the\ninnateness concept outlined in Section 4 will require taking these\nclaims more seriously and looking in detail at how nativist researchers\nuse the idea of innateness, perhaps through detailed case studies. \n\nPhilosophical scepticism about innateness draws on a longstanding\ntradition of scepticism in developmental psychobiology. This research\ntradition interprets many of its own results as demonstrating the\ninadequacy of the innate/acquired distinction, and it is critical of\nthe results and interpretations of results found in neo-nativist\nresearch. Philosophical defenders of the distinction would benefit from\nlooking at these cases, in which the distinction is purportedly\ninapplicable or unhelpful, in addition to the cases used by\nneo-nativists to exemplify the distinction. \n\nOne thing seems clear, which is that efforts to clarify the\ndistinction in psychology by appeal to the underlying genetics have not\nbeen successful. The innate/acquired distinction does not seem to get\nmuch grip on the findings of lower-level developmental sciences such as\nmolecular developmental biology. Once again, this suggests that the\ndistinction may be best understood via its actual use in psychological\nresearch.","contact.mail":"paul.griffiths@sydney.edu.au","contact.domain":"sydney.edu.au"}]
