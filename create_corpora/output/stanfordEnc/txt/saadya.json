Saadya defends\nthe truth as well as the reasonableness of Biblical and\nrabbinic writings within the Jewish tradition, engages in polemics\nagainst members of the Jewish community who dispense with rabbinic\nauthority, and brings a unique blend of philosophical and theological\nsensibilities to bear on questions of epistemology, morality and\nreligion. Well-known for his discussion of the difference between\n“laws of reason” and “laws of revelation,”\nSaadya is also often characterized, in his focus on the importance of\nhuman reason, as following certain trends in Islamic (in particular,\nMu‘tâzilite) Kalâm theology.\n\n\n Saadya Gaon (Saadya ben Joseph, known in Arabic as Sa'id ‘ibn\nYusuf al-Fayyûmî) was born in Fayyûm (upper Egypt)\nin 882 and died in Baghdad in 942. Theologian, philosopher and rabbi,\nSaadya's legacy includes a number of philosophical and theological\ntreatises, 2 Arabic translations of the Bible, a [mostly non-extant]\nBiblical commentary in Arabic, various rabbinical, mathematical, and\ngrammatical writings, a Hebrew dictionary, liturgical poems and a\nJewish prayer book.  \n A key figure in the life of the Jewish community, Saadya's rabbinic\ncareer included influential involvement in a controversial Jewish\ncalendrical reform and a contested rise to the position of head Rabbi\nat the Sura Academy. \n In his general philosophical comportment, Saadya upholds the need for\nand importance of reason, even in a religious context of revelation\nand faith. In fact, in his commitment to the importance of human\nreason (including the sense in which reason can judge the rightness of\nat least a number of Biblical commands and prohibitions), Saadya's\ntheological ideas may be said to reflect Islamic Kalâm\nsensibilities (in particular, the teachings of the\nMu‘tâzilites).  \n It is this commitment to upholding the importance of reason —\nand its fruits, knowledge and certainty — that lies at the core\nof Saadya's  main philosophical text, the Kitâb\nal-Amânât wal-'I‘tiqâdât, or The\nBook of Doctrines and Beliefs (known in Samuel Ibn Tibbon's\nHebrew translation as Sefer ha-'Emûnôt\nve-ha-Deôt). In what follows, we will refer to this text as\nthe Amânât. In this magnum opus, Saadya aims to\nmove people beyond the various epistemological and existential\nparalyses through which they are consigned to living always and only\nin the shadows of error and doubt.  Concerned to help cure this\ndistinctive human ill, Saadya hopes to provide people instead with\ntruth and certainty — the grounds for right living. And so,\nfollowing upon an opening passage of epistemological praise to\n“the Lord, the God of Israel, to whom the truth is known with\nabsolute certainty,” Saadya begins the\nAmânât, with a statement of his work's\nepistemological purpose: \n The sad state of affairs among men which Saadya sees as the impetus\nfor his work is described a few lines later in terms of erroneous\nlife-patterns which stem from various failures of reason: \n Concerned to remedy a people's inability to surmount error and doubt,\nSaadya's epistemological curative is directly in the service of life:\nSaadya wants to be able to provide his readers with the capacity to\nknow truly and with certainty because he wants to provide them\na genuine space in which to live truly and with certainty.  \n Saadya, we may say, essentially sets out to provide his readers with\na dual reason-based and faith-based ground for living. It is in the\nservice of this dual-ground for living that Saadya grapples throughout\nhis text with the question of reason's relation to revelation,\nbeginning with an analysis of four modes of proper knowing,\nviz. knowledge from sense perception, knowledge from reason, knowledge\nfrom inference and knowledge from tradition.  \n Tradition for Saadya demarcates a unique category of knowing, in\nthat, unlike the 3 other epistemological processes he addresses\n(viz. sensory, inferential and reason-based knowing), knowing by\ntradition comes to a person (or a group) all at once (as opposed to\nbeing a process unfolding in time, as is the case for the other 3\nmodes of knowing).  Furthermore, knowledge received from tradition is\nnot only immediately received, but is additionally\nimmediately certain to its\nrecipient(s). “tradition” translates Saadya's Arabic\n“al-kabar” (Ibn Tibbon's Hebrew: haggadah),\nwhich literally has the sense of “a report.” The\nconceptual heart of tradition can hence be understood as a kind of\nreliable report — or heard testimony transmitted from\nperson to person. It might further be noted that tradition\n(al-kabar) has its root in the Arabic verb kabara,\n“to experience,” with the additional sense of “to\nknow,” and even “to know thoroughly.” As such,\nSaadya's Arabic notion of tradition-as-report carries with it already\na suggestion of reliable knowledge. \n Here, explicitly identifying Scripture as tradition (though\nelsewhere, he speaks of rabbinic writings as tradition too), he\nexplains: \n Reliable tradition, hence, is the report that one can trust. It is an\nimmediate source for certain knowledge. \n While in his discussions of tradition, Saadya uses the word\n‘kabar’ which we have already seen to carry with it\nthe sense of reporting (but also, knowing), on this issue of\ntradition-as-report it is useful also to consider another Arabic root,\nsami‘a (to hear). While in and of itself, this root\nsimply means ‘to hear,’ it is, we might note, conceptually\nlinked to the notion of ‘report’ in the simple sense that\nreceiving a report most often involves hearing. And so, there is, in\nthe Arabic, a conceptual link between ‘to hear’ and\nSaadya's notion of tradition (kabar, as a\n“report”). In fact, the Arabic root ‘to hear’\nappears in one of its constructed forms\n(samâ‘î) with the literal straightforward\nmeaning of ‘traditional’, or ‘derived from\ntradition’. This link, then, between the notions of hearing and\ntradition in Saadya's Arabic linguistic and conceptual space is\nimportant to helping us properly ‘recover’ the essence of\nSaadya's notion of “revelation.” Contrary to the\nLatin-rooted “revelation,” which literally means,\n“recovering” (from Latin vêô, to cover,\nand hence “to reveal” literally as “to\nrecover”), the Arabic term which gets translated as\n“revelation” in Saadya's work is grounded in the Arabic\nroot “to hear.” Consider in particular Saadya's important\ndiscussion of a class of Biblical precepts, often translated as\n“laws of revelation.” Following on a distinction already\ndrawn in rabbinic sources, but providing the first extended discussion\nof this distinction in a Jewish philosophical text, Saadya draws our\nattention to the presence of 2 classes of laws in the Hebrew\nscriptures, most frequently translated as the “laws of\nreason” and the “laws of revelation.” For the\n“laws of reason,” Saadya uses the word\n‘aqliyyât, from the word ‘aql\n(lit. the faculty of intellect), and hence, we might say, these laws\nare ‘the ones that are (or, can  be) known by human\nintellect,’ or ‘the ones that are (or, at least can in\ntheory be) arrived at through human reason’. As for the\n“laws of revelation,” Saadya here employs the word\nsam‘iyyât, from the root sami‘a,\n‘to hear’; hence these laws are literally ‘the ones\nthat are heard’. The point, then, is to be aware that the Arabic\nroot of the word translated as “revelation” in the\ndistinction between “laws of reason” and “laws of\nrevelation” is a word that linguistically carries on its sleeve\nthe notion of “being heard” and, as such, carries with it\na more immediate correlation with the very concept of tradition (as\nthe [heard] report) than does the Latin-rooted term\n“revelation.”  \n Appreciating the link — through the conceptual chain of\nreporting and hearing — between tradition and\nrevelation in Saadya is important for many reasons. First, it is\nimportant in and of itself, reminding us that translation can often\nmake us miss the conceptual overtones of the tradition we are trying\nto recover. Secondly, this link speaks directly to Saadya's own\ncommitment to the rabbinic tradition in Judaism as itself just as\nimportant as — and on equal epistemological footing with —\nthe revealed scripture (contrary to the Karaite movement in Judaism\nwhich during Saadya's time was especially vociferous in flatly denying\nany binding authority to rabbinic law, and against whose ideas Saadya\ncomposed polemical responses). In other words, coming to appreciate\nthe conceptual link in Arabic between the idea of revelation and that\nof tradition (as we have shown above) might certainly be useful in\nhelping us better appreciate Saadya's own treatment of the rabbinic\ntradition (or, oral law) as divinely revealed. Furthermore, coming to\nappreciate this ‘link-in-hearing’ between\nrevelation and tradition additionally helps to elucidate the direct\nlink in Saadya between these two concepts, and prophecy. For Saadya,\nprophecy is, in part, a divinely “created word”\nheard by the prophet. On this picture, it is obvious —\nsimply from the conceptual space of the Arabic terms — that,\nthrough this idea of hearing, revelation, tradition and\nprophecy are all intimately related. Although his notion of prophecy\nalso includes a visual element, the “created glory”\n(though it is interesting to note that for Saadya, the ultimate\nprophetic experience of Moses was only auditory and did not\ninclude this visual element), it is nonetheless important to stress\nthe immediate connection between notions of divine speaking, and human\nreception-as-hearing, itself with overtones for both revelation\nand tradition as the joint repositories of ‘the things that are\n[reliably] heard’ (and hence, known). \n In addition, then, to this “created word” auditory\nphenomenon revealed to the prophet, Saadya's doctrine of prophecy also\ninvolves the “created glory”, a kind of visual element of\nthe prophecy, described in particular by Saadya as the verification\nmechanism for the prophet.  It is in seeing the created glory that the\nprophet knows his prophetic encounter to be true (though, as mentioned\nabove, Saadya suggests that the prophecy of Moses lacked this visual\naspect, consisting in an encounter with created word alone).  \n In Saadya's Commentary on the Book of Creation\n(Tafsîr Kitâb al-Mabâdî), we learn more\nabout the created glory in Saadya's doctrine of a\n“2nd air.” There, created glory, or the\n“2nd air,” is described as a prophetic\nintermediary of some sort between God and man.  \n The prophetic air in question is described by Saadya as\n“second” precisely in the sense that it is anterior to, as\nwell as subtler and more powerful than, regular elemental air (which\nhe calls “manifest air”). In other words, from the human\nvantage point, regular breathable air is “first”, and\n“prophetic air” is “second.” If we take this\nin some spatial sense, the idea would seem to be that this\n2nd more subtle, refined variety of air lies midway\nbetween the regular human realm and the divine realm. This reading\nwould suggest that created glory is not only a source for prophecy,\nbut is, at least prima facie, a cosmic intermediary, playing an\nintermediating role in the prophetic encounter.  Futhermore, thus\nseeing the 2nd air as a ‘cosmic intermediary’\nmight seem to suggest that it is an hypostasized reality, a point\nwhich seems further supported by Saadya's own description of this\n2nd air as a ‘shay makhlûq’\n(‘a created thing’).  \n Along these lines, it might be noted that in an influential study of\nthe prophetic phenomenon in Saadya, Altmann sees Saadya's\ncommitment to created glory as a commitment in particular to some sort\nof an hypostasized entity; in fact, it is precisely on the basis of\nthis hypostasizing view that Altmann argues for distinguishing\nSaadya's theory of prophecy from the Mu‘tâzilite\n view.[2]\n All this said, though, the exact nature of the created glory in\nSaadya is somewhat ambiguous, and, as such, it seems at least\nplausible to deny that this element of Saadya's prophetic view is\nintended in a strictly reified sense. What is clear, in any case, is\nthat it is through his descriptions and analyses of created word and\ncreated glory that Saadya strives to unambiguously ground the\nlegitimacy and objectivity of prophecy, and hence, of tradition\nitself. \n While the entire Bible is, for Saadya, revealed (particularly as an\nauditory prophecy-to-Moses which is then reported to — and\nhence, received as tradition by — future generations), Saadya's\nfocus on the “laws of revelation” demarcates not all of\nthe revealed Bible, and not even all of the laws found in the revealed\nBible, but rather, only a subsection of those laws. To better\nunderstand what the “laws of revelation” refer to,\nconsider again the contrast class, viz. the “laws of\nreason” (which are of course also found in the revealed\nBible). As mentioned above, this distinction between 2 classes of\nBiblical laws is already alluded to in rabbinic literature\n(cf. Babylonian Talmud, Yoma 67b); Saadya, though, is\nseen as the first Jewish writer to really engage this discussion\nphilosophically. Saadya addresses this distinction in the third\nchapter of his Amânât (a chapter devoted to an\ninvestigation of “commandment and prohibition”). The\n“laws of reason” (again, the ones described as\n“ ‘aqliyyât ” from the root\n“intellect”) are essentially characterized there as\ncommandments and prohibitions in the Bible whose reasons could be\narrived at independently by any rational human being. In other words,\nthese are laws which ought to ‘make sense’ to any\nreasonable person, and, as such, are basic (one might say, natural)\nmoral laws which, left to our own devices, we ought come up with on\nour own. Examples of such laws are the prohibitions against murder,\nadultery, theft, and lying. The “laws of reason” are\ndescribed by Saadya as legislating over matters that, as Saadya says,\nGod “has implanted approval [or, in cases of prohibition,\ndisapproval] of…in our reason” (Altmann, 97). The\n“laws of revelation” (sam‘iyyât, again,\nfrom the root sami‘a, ‘to hear’) are\ndescribed on the contrary as follows: \n In the pages immediately following, Saadya gives as examples of such\nlaws: the laws demarcating Sabbath and other festival days as separate\nfrom ‘ordinary’ days, rules about who gets chosen as a\nprophet and/or leader, the Jewish dietary laws, certain sexual\nprohibitions, and laws of purity and impurity. \n Having seen the difference between the “laws of reason”\nand the “laws of revelation,” we get an even better sense\nof Saadya's uniquely religious epistemological stance by looking more\ngenerally at how reason and revelation relate to one another in his\nsystem. Broadly considering ways in which reason and revelation come\ntogether for Saadya, we find the complexity of Saadya's\nepistemological sensibility, the sense, that is, in which revelation\nis both brought in support of, but also itself supported by,\nreason.  \n First, Saadya provides what he takes to be a reason-based account of\nwhy the “laws of reason” were included by God in the\nrevealed Bible at all — after all, if they are the sorts of\nthings that reasonably sensible human beings ought to arrive at on\ntheir own, why did God bother revealing them? To this question, Saadya\ncan be taken as providing two answers: \n 1. God, in His benevolence, did not see fit to leave us to figure\nmorality out on our own; even though we could arrive at certain\nkey moral ideas on the basis of our own human reasoning, God, by\nrevealing these moral ideas to us, essentially gives us a shortcut, as\nit were. \n For Saadya, it is only reasonable that God in His kindness reveal to\nus even those laws which we could, in theory, arrive at on the basis\nof our own reasoning, for this both expedites as well as ensures our\nengagement with proper norms for living. Human reason is in this way\nshown to be helped by revelation. And yet, in this very act of\nanalysis — in which a reasoned account of the importance of\nrevelation is given — Saadya essentially at one and the same\ntime shows us how revelation is helped — at least in the sense\nof supported — by reason. \n 2. Following a further line of reasoning (itself outlined more fully\nbelow in our treatment of Saadya's analysis of why God issued\n“laws of revelation”), Saadya explains how, by including\n“laws of reason” in the list of divinely revealed\ncommandments and prohibitions, God, in effect, allows His subjects to\ndo what they would be doing anyway (viz. acting in accordance with\nbasic, reason-based moral ideals), but enables them to get the\nadditional bonus of being rewarded for ‘doing God's\nbidding’.  \n God gives His followers more opportunity to reap rewards by making\neven the self-evident norms of moral living matters of divine\nobeisance.  We might say that for Saadya, God supplements a natural\nlaw ethics (and/or a Virtue Theory ethics) with a divine command\ntheory for the purpose of increasing human rewards. reason, in this\nway, is helped by revelation. And yet again, in the very composition\nof an account of the reasonableness of revelation, Saadya here too\nshows revelation to be helped — at least in the sense of\nsupported — by reason. \n Regarding the larger question of obeisance to God, Saadya (in chapter\n3 of the Amânât) provides what he takes to be a\nreason-based account of why one ought to follow God and obey His laws,\nand can in this way be seen as providing a reason-based appraisal of\nrevelation most broadly construed. This argument is provided in 4\nparts, and centers, in turn, on the reasonableness of God's expecting\nus to render thanks to Him, the reasonableness of God expecting us to\nrespect Him and His name, the reasonableness of God's expecting us to\nact rightly towards fellow humans, and the reasonableness of God's\ngiving us commands and prohibitions for the express purpose of being\nable to give us rewards. In this discussion, Saadya in yet another way\nemploys reason in support of revelation.  Here, revelation is once\nagain helped — at least in the sense of supported — by\nreason. \n In fact, Saadya even provides what he takes to be a reason-based\naccount of the “laws of revelation” — the very laws\n“regarding which reason passes no judgment” and which, as\nsuch, are not, in his very own opinion on the matter, subject to human\nevaluation at all! According to Saadya, humans don't know what God has\nin mind regarding this class of laws, and yet, champion of reason as\nSaadya appears to be, he nonetheless decides (albeit tentatively, and\nwith qualification) to provide reasons for these laws. In fact, Saadya\nnot only gives reasons for the “laws of revelation” as a\nclass of law in general, but he then additionally offers explanations\nfor the particularities of individual cases in point of such laws. In\nthis latter effort, Saadya not only provides numerous possible reasons\nfor the particularities of any given “law of revelation,”\nbut attempts in his explanations to show how the law in question is\nactually of practical benefit to humans.  \n Starting with the first, more general level of explanation, Saadya\nprovides a reason for God's having commanded “laws of\nrevelation” broadly speaking: First, it was a benevolent act\ndesigned by God to give humans extra opportunities to serve Him, and,\nthereby, extra opportunities to increase their rewards and\nhappiness: \n By having more opportunities to serve God, we are given more\nopportunities to reap divine rewards. For Saadya, nothing could be\nmore reasonable. \n An example, then, of Saadya's subsequent attempt to provide even\nfurther reasons for the particulars of specific “laws of\nrevelation” (reasons, moreover, which point to the practical\nbenefits of those laws) can be seen in his two attempted explanations\nof the Jewish dietary laws: \n In both his more general and more individualized attempts to explain\nthe reasonableness of the “laws of revelation,” Saadya\nonce again employs reason in support of revelation.  \n And yet, turning to some stronger senses in which, on the contrary,\nreason is supported by revelation, Saadya (in a section in chapter 3\nof the Amânât addressing why it is necessary for\nGod to send “messengers and prophets”) provides a general\nexplanation not only (as above) of why the “laws of\nreason” are themselves revealed, but of why the “laws of\nreason” must be further accompanied by additional revealed\ninformation. In this discussion, Saadya stresses that even the most\nrational moral ideal is beset with vagueness about the details of how\nbest to effect the sought after result; and so, while reason can tell\nus that we ought not commit adultery, it doesn't necessarily provide\nus with the sorts of ‘when, where and how’ details\nthat are needed to translate even the best moral theory into\nactual practice. In effect, Saadya explains that, \n In one sense, this too can be seen as another reason (supplementing\nthe two provided above) why the “laws of reason” are\nthemselves revealed in the Bible: different from anything addressed\nabove, here the idea would be that the Biblical revelation includes\ndetails for action that human reason on its own does not provide. And\nyet, it seems worth noting that Saadya in this section of his text (as\nrepresented by the above quote) seems to focus explicitly on those\nrequisite details that are provided by the rabbinic tradition\n(details about times of prayer, etc.). This seems to suggest that this\nline of reasoning about the relationship of reason and revelation is\nslightly different from what we have addressed above. And so: whereas\nabove, the question was ‘Why are the “laws of\nreason” revealed in the Bible?’, here, the question is\n‘Why are the “laws or reason” accompanied by\nrevealed Oral law traditions about these laws?’ Seeing Saadya's\nline of reasoning here in this way, we may highlight the link between\nthe notions of revelation, prophecy and tradition, here precisely in\nthe sense of rabbinic tradition. As discussed above, for Saadya, the\nauthority of the written Bible and the oral law (or, rabbinic\ntradition) are on equal footing.  Here again, though now with\nimplications for the role of rabbinic tradition, we see that, for\nSaadya, reason is helped by revelation (here, it would seem, in the\nsense of rabbinic tradition). \n In further support of some stronger senses in which Saadya employs\nrevelation in support of reason, there seems to emerge what we might\nidentify as a kind of ‘illuminationist’ strain in Saadya's\nepistemology, a strain in light of which human reason seems ultimately\ngrounded upon a personal divine revelation of sorts. Consider how\nSaadya, right at the Amânât's outset, revealingly\nqualifies the nature of human reason in a discussion of his own role\nas ‘knower’ through an especially evocative image of\nsinking men in the hands of a salvific diver. Describing his reaction\nto the state of his community's ignorance and doubt, Saadya says: \n Saadya sees himself as the able swimmer setting out to rescue the\npeople Israel — and all of mankind — from their drowning\nfates, and yet, in his image, his own reliance upon the hand of God is\nimmediately evident: Saadya sees himself as the salvific diver, or, to\nchange imagery, the ‘tongue’ that through books might\nspeak people out of their quandaries, and yet, as he states above, it\nis “my Lord [who] has granted unto me some knowledge… and\nendowed me with some ability.” Finding in himself a guiding\nvoice, he is quick to find too that his is a voice that is received\nfrom above: His voice is that of the “them that are\ntaught” — his ability to help save those who are drowning\nis not his own, but is, rather, ‘taught,’ a gift given to\nhim by God.  \n In this, there emerges an important sense in which, for Saadya,\nreason rests on a kind of personal revelation. And so, here too,\nrevelation is ultimately brought in support of reason. \n The importance of revelation as a ground in Saadya can be further\nseen in his understanding of the commandments and prohibitions as\nthemselves gracious gifts from God: \n In his sensitive responsiveness to even existence itself as divine\ngift, Saadya finds in the commandments and prohibitions of revelation\na God-given path to salvation: by following these God-given precepts,\none can hope to secure his or her welfare. In this, his understanding\nof Jewish law as heavenly gift, we can already see the sense in which\nfor Saadya, revelation is a ground for living — it is the basis\nupon which a person can live in the light of divine favor. \n In further support of a sense in which Saadya identifies revelation\nas a ground, we may look to the very methodology and structure of the\nAmânât itself. In particular, consider the\nAmânât's liberal employment of Biblical prooftexts:\nevery reason-exemplifying analysis or argument is, within Saadya's\nwork, ultimately rooted in a scriptural verse.  Beckoning, we might\nsay, to the lived experience of faith (as opposed to the important,\nthough limited, cognitive experience of reason), these prooftexts\nthemselves stand as testaments to both the centrality and\nphenomenological uniqueness of ‘knowing by tradition’ (or,\nrevelation) in Saadya's world-view.  Evocative and transformative in\ntheir scope, these Biblical verses are themselves revelations —\nand enactments — of faith in the very fabric of Saadya's\nreason-based endeavor. In this way, we may say that the method and\nform of Saadya's writing (viz. his use of prooftexts in\naddition to his use of reasoned arguments) helps emphasize the\nimportance for Saadya of revelation and knowledge-from-tradition as\nseparate from reason-based knowing. As such, we may say in particular\nof those Biblical prooftexts employed by Saadya in support of the\nimportance of reasoning, that they simultaneously (one might even\nsay, paradoxically) beckon us to (a) the limitations of reasoning, (b)\nthe need for (and consistency with reason of) revealed Knowledge, and\neven (c) the need to ground a life of reasoned reflection in a life of\nrevealed tradition. Through his constant engagement with revealed\ntexts to support the importance of reason, Saadya, in the very act of\nchampioning reason, can be seen as planting reason on the ground of\nrevelation.  \n Saadya's liberal peppering of his analyses and arguments with\nBiblical prooftexts can in this way be seen as incarnations of faith\nin his text, incarnations which speak volumes about his complex\nunderstanding of reason's relation to revelation. It would seem that\nfaith — and not simply reason — runs throughout and\ngrounds Saadya's text, itself a model for Saadya's conception of the\nwell-lived life. \n Following on many of the above considerations about the grounding of\nreason in revelation, and struck more generally by what might be\ndescribed as a ‘faith-seeks-understanding’ methodology,\none may legitimately ask: In spite of his own defense of, call for and\nengagement with reason, is reason really the hallmark of Saadya's\nworld-view? To see how one might answer “no” to this\nquestion, consider the writings of Moses Maimonides (a later Jewish\nmedieval philosopher). For Maimonides, Saadya's speculative\ntheological reasoning might easily be seen as\nreasoning-in-the-service-of-pre-established-ideas (in this case,\ntheological commitments).  This sort of ‘reasoning’ is\nprecisely the sort of thing that Maimonides (in the extended critique\nof Kalam which he offers in his Guide of the Perplexed)\nlambastes as a fanciful, non-philosophical mode of\npseudo-reasoning. To the extent that Saadya's work falls prey to\nMaimonides' critique of Kalâm theology, it would not, properly\nspeaking, be a truly reason-based system. While Saadya states that\n“the truth of reliable tradition” is “based on the\nknowledge of sense perception and the knowledge of reason”\n(Altmann, 37), there are serious grounds for suggesting, nonetheless,\nthat for Saadya, it is tradition and revelation, and the presence of\nGod in man's life that these entail, which are ultimately the first\nfoundations for knowing and living. The centrality of reason\nnotwithstanding, revelation may ultimately be Saadya's final\nground. \n In considering the possibility of revelation as ground, consider the\nsense in which, for Saadya, revelation entails praxis. In addition to\ndescribing knowledge as that which God has placed within him, Saadya,\nin the above ‘salvific diver’ quote, sees that in having\nreceived the divine gift of knowledge, he has become a locus of\nobligation: in having divinely received reason's fruit, he has, at one\nand the same time, been called to take on the God-given responsibility\nto help save those who are drowning. Acting on his responsibility to\nsnatch the lost drifters from the watery graves of doubt and error,\nSaadya hopes that \n\n As is already evident in these sentiments at the very start of the\nAmânât, and as becomes clearer throughout the\ncourse of the text, for Saadya there is always an immediate\ncorrelation between the ability to think (or reason) on the one hand,\nand, on the other hand, both (a) a receptivity to divine giving,\ncoupled with (b) an obligation of moral responsiveness in the face of\nthe Other. In this (as in other ideas of his), we find an intimate and\ninextricable link between the human capacity to manifest reason, the\nhuman capacity to receive revelation, and the human responsibility to\nbe ethically responsive. In this sense, ‘receiving\nrevelation’ must itself be understood as a person's — or\ncommunity's — joint resolution to hearing and\nacting-in-accordance-with the voice of God, itself manifest in\nhearing and acting-in-accordance-with the voice of\ntradition. tradition in this sense emerges in Saadya as a communal\nreceptacle for revelation, parallel, though on a larger scale, to the\nreceptive heart of the individual prophet who receives the word of\nGod. Along these lines, we might say that\nrevelation-cum-tradition emerges as the key ingredient to\nSaadya's epistemological prescription for truth and certainty, and as\nsuch, as the key ingredient to Saadya's prescription for living\n— his prescription, that is, for how to live life with the sort\nof fullness that only truth and certainty can provide, and which only\nfaith-with-reason can hope to attain. \n Saadya upholds the absolute unity of God, and argues firmly for\ncreation ex nihilo. In this former regard, Saadya shares a\nsensibility with the Mu‘tâzilite theologians, and reveals\na knowledge of various heated debates on this theme at play in Islamic\ncircles during his time. On the issue of creation, Saadya defends a\ncreation ex nihilo position (though here breaks further company\nwith the Mu‘tâzilites who, in addition to creation ex\nnihilo, advanced an atomistic doctrine of continuous\n[re-]creation). In fact, between the various arguments he offers in\nhis Amânât as well as in his Commentary on the\nBook of Creation, Saadya defends the creation ex nihilo\nposition against 18 other theories, each of which he critiques in\nturn. In this series of arguments, Saadya reveals a familiarity with a\nnumber of philosophical and theological doctrines, including those of\nthe pre-Socratics, Plato and the Pythagoreans (though it should be\nnoted that his knowledge of these thinkers would have been largely\nbased on doxographies and other Arabic encyclopedic sources).  \n In addition to refutations of 12 of the cosmogonic views (more of\nwhich he refutes in other works), Saadya provides us in the\nAmânât with proofs for the creation of the world\nex nihilo by God. He proceeds in three stages: he begins with\nfour proofs for the creation of the world (described respectively as\nproofs from finitude, composition, accidents, and time), moves on to\nthree reasons for why that creation must be rooted in an external\ncreator (as opposed to some idea of the self-createdness of the\nworld), and ends by showing how that creation must furthermore be\nunderstood as creation ex nihilo (as opposed to a creation out\nof some pre-existent matter). As Harry Wolfson has shown, Saadya bases\nhis four proofs for the createdness of the world on Islamic\nKalâm traditions (see Wolfson, 1943). \n Providing details of Saadya's arguments for creation ex nihilo\nis less interesting for our current purposes than making some\nobservations about Saadya's sensibilities about reason and revelation\nin these discussions. In the case of creation as well as the case of\nGod's unity, Saadya sees demonstration by reason as a cornerstone of\nbelief. At least in the case of some religious beliefs, reason alone\narrives at the ideas in question, and, furthermore, can prove that\nthey are true. It is worth noting in this regard a potential contrast\nwith some of the other chapters in the Amânât (such\nas chapters 6 and 7 on soul and resurrection respectively) which start\nwith the phrase “Our Lord has informed us that...” Might\nthis suggest that, for Saadya, the analysis of certain religious\ntopics is predicated on a somewhat different methodological\nperspective on the role of reason? However we answer this question, it\nis at least true that for Saadya, in the case of creation, reason is\nable to prove the religious idea of an external, ex nihilo\ncreatedness. And so, Saadya speaks here of the thesis which “we\nseek to establish” (49), and ends the section with the\ndescription of “having thus succeeded in demonstrating by\nargument [the doctrine of creation ex nihilo]...” (62). This\nestablished, though, he then goes on to add “...as it has been\nverified by the Tradition of the Prophets and by miracles...”\n(62). The role of revelation in Saadya's thought is always present. In\naddition to supplementing each demonstration with a supporting text\nfrom either the Bible or the Talmud (the written Rabbinic tradition),\nhe ends his exercise in reason with reference to tradition, prophets,\nand miracles. \n Following upon this delicate interplay of reason and revelation, it\nis interesting to note how the proofs for creation come up again in\nSaadya's treatment of resurrection. While the reasons Saadya gives for\nbelieving in the truth of resurrection have primarily to do with the\nreliability of Tradition, Saadya additionally invokes his reason-based\nproofs of creation ex nihilo to support the at least prima\nfacie reasonabless of such beliefs. Speaking against the critic who\nfinds the very idea of God's rejuvenating the dead philosophically\nuntenable, Saadya stresses that resurrection is not “rejected by\nreason because the second creation of a thing which was already in\nexistence and became dissolved, is more acceptable to reason than the\ncreation ex nihilo” (158). Since the idea of something's\nbeing created ex nihilo is less reasonable than the idea of its\nbeing re-created, and since the idea of creation ex nihilo has\nalready been proven true by reason, therefore, a fortiori,\nsurely belief in resurrection is at least reasonable. Here, Saadya's\nproof for creation ex nihilo emerges in the service of his\nbelief in resurrection. \n Preceeding the discussion of resurrection, and following a few\nchapters after his analyses of creation, Saadya addresses the nature\nof soul. Although rejecting Plato's creation view, Saadya rests his\nown theory of soul upon a Platonic tripartite psychology. And so,\nafter rejecting a number of other views of soul, Saadya describes the\nsoul's three faculties as “the faculty of discernment, the\nfaculty of appetite, and the faculty of courage” (147). Of\ncourse, to this Platonic foundation, he adds a number of\nTradition-rooted descriptions of soul as well. In fact, even before\nany philosophical consideration of the nature of soul, Saadya begins\nhis discussion with a quote from Zechariah 12:1 about God's\nforming “the spirit of man within him.” Also before any\nphilosophical considerations, Saadya — following on this opening\nScriptural text — speaks of God's “set[ting] a time-limit\nto the combined existence of body and soul” (141), to His\n“separating” body and soul at the time of death\n“until the time when the number of souls which His wisdom has\ndecided to call into being is completed” (141), and to the time\nwhen “He re-unites [souls] with their respective bodies and\nmetes out their reward” (141). Scriptural citations coupled with\ndoctrines of resurrection and final judgement set the stage for\nSaadya's discourse on the nature of soul, leading us once again to\nconsider the delicate interplay of reason and revelation in the pages\nof his thought. This interplay can be further seen in Saadya's own\nPlato-plus-Tradition understanding of soul. In addition to coupling\nPlatonic tripartite psychology with Jewish beliefs about resurrection,\nSaadya actually links each of Plato's three discrete soul-fuctions to\nthree discrete Hebrew terms for “soul” found in Scriptures\n(nefesh as corresponding to the appetitive function,\nruah as corresponding to the faculty of passion and courage,\nand neshamah in correspondence to the faculty of knowledge)\n(147). Saadya additionally cites the Scriptural tendency to speak of\n“heart and soul together” (148) in support of what he\ntakes to be provable on empirical grounds (upon which he elaborates),\nviz. that “the soul is in the heart of man” (148).","contact.mail":"spessin@du.edu","contact.domain":"du.edu"}]
