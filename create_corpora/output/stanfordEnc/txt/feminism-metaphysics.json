It considers, for example, concepts such\nas identity, causation, substance, and\nkind, that seem to be presupposed by any form of inquiry; and\nit attempts to determine what there is at the most general level. For\nexample, are there minds in addition to bodies? Do things persist\nthrough change? Is there freewill or is all action determined by prior\nevents? But since metaphysics not only concerns itself with what there\nis (ontology), but also the nature of that which exists,\nmetaphysicians ask, for example, whether numbers, if they exist, are\ndependent upon human thought and practices in some way, whether the\nconcepts and categories we use to think of and describe reality\ninfluence or determine in any way what is described, and whether and\nhow values are embodied in our categories and descriptions. It should\nthus not come as a surprise that there could be a specifically\nfeminist metaphysics, where the question of prime importance is to\nwhat extent the central concepts and categories of metaphysics, in\nterms of which we make sense of our reality, could be value laden in\nways that are particularly gendered.\n\n\nIn this way, feminist theorists have asked whether and, if so, to what\nextent our frameworks for understanding the world are distorting in\nways that privilege men or masculinity. What, if anything, is eclipsed\nif we adopt an Aristotelian framework of substance and essence, or a\nCartesian framework of immaterial souls present in material bodies?\nAnd is what’s left out of such frameworks relevant to the\ndevaluation or oppression of women? Feminists have also considered the\nstructure of social reality and the relationship between the social\nworld and the natural world. Because social structures are often\njustified as natural, or necessary to control what’s natural,\nfeminists have questioned whether such references to nature are\nlegitimate. This has led to considerable work on the idea of social\nconstruction and, more specifically, the social construction of\ngender.\n\nSpeaking very generally, the project of feminist metaphysics asks:\nHave metaphysical claims about what there is, and what it is like,\nsupported sexism, and if so, how? Are there particular metaphysical\nassumptions or patterns of inference that feminists should challenge\n(or endorse)? Replies to these questions have offered critiques and\nreconstructions of concepts for thinking about, e.g., the self (Meyers\n1997, 2004a; Willett, Anderson, & Meyers 2016), sex and sexuality\n(Butler 1987, 1990, 1993; Fausto-Sterling 2000), mind and body (Bordo\n1987, 1993; Young 1990; Scheman 1993; Gatens 1996; Wendell 1996;\nSchiebinger 2000), nature (Lloyd 1984; Haraway1991; Butler 1993;\nWarren 1997), essence (Witt 1993, 1995, 2011b,c; Schor & Weed\n1994; Stoljar 1995), identity (Spelman 1988; Lugones 1994; Young 1994;\nFrye 1996; Lindemann Nelson 2001; Alcoff 2006; Warnke 2008;\nHeinämaa 2011; Lindemann 2014), and objectification (Papadaki 2015).\nFeminists have also questioned whether metaphysics is a legitimate\nform of inquiry at all, raising epistemological questions about, e.g.,\nfoundationalist assumptions implicit in metaphysical inquiry (Irigaray\n1985; Flax 1986; Fraser & Nicholson 1990; Haslanger 2000a). We\nwill focus here on the former set of issues, mentioning methodological\nand epistemological questions only in passing. \nTo begin an overview of feminist metaphysics in this century, it is\nhelpful to return to Simone de Beauvoir’s classic work The\nSecond Sex (Beauvoir 1949). Two of her most famous claims appear\nto have profound metaphysical implications: “One is not born,\nbut rather becomes, a woman”, (Beauvoir [1949] 1989: 267) and\n“He is the Subject, he is the Absolute—she is the\nOther” (Beauvoir [1949] 1989: xxviii). There is disagreement\nabout how to interpret both claims, yet to many the former serves as\nthe slogan for the view that gender is socially constructed, and the\nlatter identifies the content of feminine construction as what is\nopposed to the masculine, the masculine also being what counts as the\nsubject or self. Three interconnected themes prominent in feminist\nmetaphysics emerge here: (i) the social construction of gender (and\nother categories), (ii) the relational nature of the self (and other\ncategories), (iii) the dangers of dualistic thinking. We will conclude\nby mentioning the challenges feminist metaphysics poses to the content\nand practice of mainstream metaphysics. \nIn claiming that one is not born a woman, Beauvoir was not suggesting\nthat one is never born with female body parts; rather, her concern was\nthat possession of female (or male) body parts, in and of itself, does\nnot imply how one could or should be socially\n situated.[1]\n In spite of this, societies, for the most part, reserve for females\ncertain social roles, norms, and activities that disadvantage them in\nrelation to males, casting the differences as necessary because\nnatural (Beauvoir [1949] 1989: Ch.1). If it is recognized, as Beauvoir\nurged, that what women and men are is at least partly a social matter,\nthis opens up the possibility that gender roles could be and so should\nbe made more equitable through social change. To simplify discussion,\nwe will use the terms ‘male’/‘female’ to mark\nthe currently familiar sex distinction drawn in terms of primary and\nsecondary sex characteristics, and\n‘man’/‘woman’ to mark the gender distinction,\nwhere gender is, according to the slogan, “the social meaning of\nsex”. \nThis theme—that social hierarchies are sustained through myths\nof their natural basis—has prompted a tremendous amount of work\non the construction of gender in particular (Delphy 1984; Scott 1986;\nMacKinnon 1989; Butler 1990; Wittig 1992; Alcoff 2006; Warnke 2008;\nWitt 2011a,c; Haslanger 2012), but also on the construction of other\n“naturalized” social categories such as race (Appiah 1996;\nZack 2002; Warnke 2008) and in a somewhat different way, sexuality\n(Butler 1990, 1993; Fausto-Sterling 2000). Research in history,\nanthropology, literature, and sociology has chronicled the various\nmechanisms by which gender (and other such categories) is enforced,\nand research in psychology and biology has further loosened the ties\nbetween body types and social roles. Having witnessed the power of\nnaturalizing “myths”, feminists tend to be wary of any\nsuggestion that a category is “natural” or that\nwhat’s “natural” should dictate how we organize\nourselves socially. However, there are several different\nde-naturalizing projects that are often mistaken for each other that\nengage different sorts of metaphysical issues. \nIt is important to distinguish first the construction of ideas and the\nconstruction of\n objects[2]\n (Hacking 1999: 9–16). Let’s start with ideas. On one\nreading, the claim that an idea or a concept is only possible within\nand due to a social context is utterly obvious. It would seem to be a\nmatter of common sense that concepts are taught to us by our parents\nthrough our language; different cultures have different concepts (that\ngo along with their different languages); and concepts evolve over\ntime as a result of historical changes, science, technological\nadvances, etc. Let’s (albeit contentiously) call this the\n“ordinary view” of concepts and ideas. Even someone who\nbelieves that our scientific concepts perfectly map\n“nature’s joints” can allow that scientists come to\nhave the ideas and concepts they do through social-historical\nprocesses. After all, social and cultural forces (including, possibly,\nthe practices and methods of science) may help us develop concepts\nthat are apt or accurate, and beliefs that are true. \nWe may sometimes forget that what and how we think is affected by\nsocial forces because our experiences seem to be caused simply and\ndirectly by world itself. However, it does not take much prompting to\nrecall that our culture is largely responsible for the interpretive\ntools we bring to the world in order to understand it. Once\nwe’ve noted that our experience of the world is already an\ninterpretation of it, we can begin to raise questions about the\nadequacy of our conceptual framework. Concepts help us organize\nphenomena; different concepts organize it in different ways. It is\nimportant, then, to ask: what phenomena are highlighted and what are\neclipsed by a particular framework of concepts? What assumptions\nprovide structure for the framework? \nFor example, our everyday framework for thinking about human beings is\nstructured by the assumptions that there are two (and only two) sexes,\nand that every human is either a male or a female. But in fact a\nsignificant percentage of humans have a mix of male and female\nanatomical features. Intersexed bodies are eclipsed in our everyday\nframework (Fausto-Sterling 2000). This should invite us to ask: Why?\nWhose interests are served, if anyone’s, by the intersexed being\nignored in the dominant conceptual framework? (It can’t be\nplausibly argued that sex isn’t important enough to us to make\nfine-grained distinctions between bodies!) Further, once we recognize\nthe intersexed, how should we revise our conceptual framework? Should\nwe group bodies into more than two sexes, or are there reasons instead\nto complicate the definitions of male and female to include everyone\nin just two sex categories? More generally, on what basis should we\ndecide what categories to use? (Fausto-Sterling 2000; Butler 1990: Ch.\n1) What is the proper scope of application of these categories? In\nasking these questions it is important to remember that an idea or\nconceptual framework may be inadequate without being false, e.g., a\nclaim might be true and yet incomplete, misleading, unjustified,\nbiased, etc. (Anderson 1995). \nSaying that this or that idea is socially constructed may just be an\ninvitation to recall the ordinary view of concepts and note the\nmotivations behind and limitations of our current framework. Every\nframework will have some limits; the issue is whether the limits\neclipse something that, given the (legitimate) goals of our inquiry,\nmatters. However, sometimes a social constructionist is making a more\ncontroversial claim. The suggestion would be that something or other\nis “merely” a social construction, in other words, that\nwhat we are taking to be real is only a fiction, an idea that fails to\ncapture reality. Feminists have argued, for example, that certain\nmental “disorders” that have been used to diagnose\nbattered women are merely social constructions. Andrea Westlund points\nout how \n[b]attered women’s “abnormalities” have been\ndescribed and redescribed within the psychiatric literature of the\ntwentieth century, characterized as everything from hysteria to\nmasochistic or self-defeating personality disorders (SDPD) to\ncodependency (Herman 1992, 116–118; Tavris 1992,\n170–207). Moreover, such pathologies measure, classify, and\ndefine battered women’s deviance not just from\n“normal” female behavior but also from universalized male\nnorms of independence and self-interest. (Westlund 1999,\n1050–1)  \nSuch diagnoses invite us to explain domestic violence by reference to\nthe woman’s psychological state rather than the batterer’s\nneed for power and control; they also “deflect attention from\nthe social and political aspects of domestic violence to the private\nneuroses to which women as a group are thought to be prone”\n(Westlund 1999: 1051). Westlund and others have argued that although\nvictims of domestic violence often do suffer from psychological\nconditions, e.g., major depression, there is a range of gender coded\nmental disorders included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\nMental Disorder (DSM) for which there is little, if any, good\nevidence. These diagnoses, it could be claimed, are merely social\nconstructions in the sense that they are ideas used to interpret and\nregulate social phenomena, but do not describe anything real. Applying\nthis to the case at hand would entail that “Self-Defeating\nPersonality Disorder” doesn’t really exist. The\ndescription of SDPD does not capture a mental disorder of the sort\n alleged.[3] \nSo in considering the claim that something is socially constructed, we\nshould ask first: Is it an object or an idea? If it is an idea, then\nwe should raise a series of epistemological questions, e.g., are we\njustified in employing this idea as we do, and metaphysical questions,\ne.g., is there anything real corresponding to the idea, or is it a\nfiction? Social constructionists often begin by noticing that an idea\nis functioning socially to support an unjust institution and then\nconsider how that idea functions within a broader framework of ideas\nand concepts to structure our experience: does it illegitimately or\ninappropriately privilege one set of phenomena over another? Does it\nobscure some phenomena completely? Does it create an illusion of\ncertain kinds of things? \nOf course in some contexts privileging certain phenomena is useful and\neven necessary: medical sciences are not “neutral” with\nrespect to what phenomena count as significant and how they are\ncategorized; medicine has a legitimate concern with human health and\nthe organisms that affect human health. However, other things being\nequal, medicine that privileges phenomena related to men’s\nhealth or the health of the wealthy would not be epistemically or\npolitically legitimate (Anderson 1995). Considering what is left out\nof a framework of categories, or what assumptions structure it can\nalso reveal biases of many sorts. \nIn some cases of social construction what’s at issue is the\naptness of the classification, in other cases it is whether the\nclassification captures a natural kind or a social kind. In yet\nfurther cases, the point is to reveal that classification does not\ndescribe anything real at all and, instead, is just a fiction being\ntreated as real. In such cases, substantial work must be done to\ndemonstrate that the idea in question is only a fiction. But\nthat’s not all, for we should also ask: How are such distortions\nand fictions established and maintained? Whose interests do they\nserve? \nNow consider objects (understanding ‘objects’ in the\nbroadest sense as virtually anything that’s not an idea). There\nis a sense in which any artifact is a construction; but claiming that\nscissors or cars are social constructions would not have much point,\ngiven how mundane this claim would be. Social constructionists, on the\nwhole, are arguing for a surprising thesis that they believe\nchallenges our everyday view of things. It is much more surprising to\nsay that women or Asian-Americans, homosexuals, child abusers, or\nrefugees, are social constructions. What could this mean? \nIn considering the construction of objects, the first point to note is\nthat our classificatory schemes, at least in social contexts, may do\nmore than just map pre-existing groups of individuals; rather our\nattributions have the power to both establish and reinforce groupings\nwhich may eventually come to “fit” the classifications.\nThis works in several ways. Forms of description or classification\nprovide for kinds of intention; e.g., given the classification\n“cool”, we can set about to become cool, or avoid being\ncool, etc. But also, such classifications can function in justifying\nbehavior; e.g., “we didn’t invite him because he’s\nnot cool”, and such justifications, in turn, can reinforce the\ndistinction between those who are cool and those who are uncool.\nDrawing on Ian Hacking’s work, Haslanger has referred to this as\n“discursive” construction: \nDiscursive construction: something is discursively\nconstructed just in case it is (to a significant extent) the way it is\nbecause of what is attributed to it or how it is classified.\n(Haslanger 1995: 99)  \nAdmittedly, the idea here is quite vague (e.g., how much is “a\nsignificant extent”?). However, social construction in this\nsense is ubiquitous. Each of us is socially constructed in this sense\nbecause we are (to a significant extent) the individuals we are today\nas a result of what has been attributed and self-attributed to us. For\nexample, being classified as able-bodied females from birth has\nprofoundly affected the paths available to us in life and the sort of\npersons we have become. \nNote, however, that to say that an entity is “discursively\nconstructed” is not to say that language or discourse brings a\nmaterial object into existence de novo. Rather something in\nexistence comes to have—partly as a result of having been\ncategorized in a certain way—a set of features that qualify it\nas a member of a certain kind or\n sort.[4]\n Someone’s having been categorized as a female at birth (and\nconsistently since then) has been a factor in how she has been viewed\nand treated; these views and treatments have, in turn, played an\nimportant causal role in her becoming gendered as a woman. For\nexample, let us suppose for current purposes that being gendered as a\nwoman is to occupy in one’s social context a broad role\nassociated with female reproductive capacities. It is through a\nprocess of socialization—being viewed and treated as a\ngirl—that she learned, and eventually internalized, what the\n“proper” role for females is and how to mark herself as\noccupying it. So she learned that girls only eat so much, only play\nsuch games, only wear certain clothes. Whether or not she accepts\nthese norms, negotiating them was the process by which she became a\nwoman; but discourse didn’t bring her into existence. \nIt would appear that gender (in different senses) is both an\nidea-construction and an object-construction. Gender is an\nidea-construction because the classification men/women is the\ncontingent result of historical events and forces. As we saw above,\nthe everyday distinction between males and females leaves out the\nintersexed population that might have been given its own sex/gender\ncategory. Arguably, in fact, some cultures have divided bodies into\nthree sexual/reproductive groups. At the same time the classifications\n‘woman’ and ‘man’ are what Hacking calls\n“interactive kinds”: gender classifications occur within a\ncomplex matrix of institutions and practices, and being classified as\na woman (or not), or a man (or not), or third, fourth, fifth\nsex/gender or not, has a profound effect on an individual. Such\nclassification will have a material effect on one’s social\nposition as well as affect one’s experience and\nself-understanding. In this sense, women and men—concrete\nindividuals—are constructed as gendered kinds of people, i.e.,\nwe are each object constructions (see Ásta Sveinsdóttir\n2015 for further details). \nThere is yet a further sense in which something might be a social\nconstruction. So far we’ve been focusing on social causation: to\nsay that something is socially constructed is to say that it is caused\nto be a certain way, and the causal process involves social factors,\ne.g., social forces were largely responsible for my coming to have the\nidea of a husband, and social forces were largely responsible for\nthere being husbands. But often when theorists argue that something is\na social construction the point is not about causation. Rather, the\npoint is to distinguish social kinds from physical kinds. In the case\nof gender, the point is that gender is not a classification scheme\nbased simply on anatomical or biological differences, but marks social\ndifferences between individuals. Gender, as opposed to sex, is not\nabout testicles and ovaries, the penis and the uterus, but about a\nsystem of social categories (see, e.g., Haslanger 1993, 2000b; also\nWittig 1992; Delphy 1984; MacKinnon 1989). \nConsider, for example, the category of landlords. To be a landlord one\nmust be located within a broad system of social and economic relations\nwhich includes tenants, private property, and the like. It might be\nthat all and only landlords have a mole behind their left ear. But\neven if this were the case, having this physical mark is not what it\nis to be a landlord. Similarly, one might want to draw a distinction\nbetween sex and gender, sex being an anatomical distinction based on\nlocally salient sexual/reproductive differences (see Ásta\nSveinsdóttir 2011 for an alternative conception), and gender\nbeing a distinction between the social/political positions of those\nwith bodies marked as of different sexes. One could allow that the\ncategories of sex and gender interact (so concerns with distinctions\nbetween bodies will influence social divisions and vice versa); but\neven to be clear how they interact, we should differentiate them. With\nthis distinction between sex and gender in hand, it is possible that\nsome males are women and some females are men. Because, on this\nconception, one is a female by virtue of some (variable) set of\nanatomical features, and one is a woman by virtue of one’s\nposition within a social and economic system, the sex/gender\ndistinction gives us some (at least preliminary) resources for\nincluding trans* people within our conceptual framework (see further\nBettcher 2014). \nIn considering this form of social construction, or we might call it\nsocial constitution, it is important to note that social kinds cannot\nbe equated with things that have social causes. Sociobiologists claim\nthat some social phenomena have biological causes; some feminists\nclaim that anatomical phenomena have social causes, e.g., the gap in\naverage height and strength differences between men and women in a\nparticular context depends on, among other things, gender norms in\nthat context concerning food and\n exercise.[5]\n As Ruth Hubbard explains, \n…we live in dynamic interaction with our environment. Sex\ndifferences are socially constructed because being raised as a girl or\na boy produces biological as well as social differences. Society\ndefines the sex-appropriate behavior to which each of us learns to\nconform, and our behavior affects our bones, muscles, sense organs,\nnerves, brain, lungs, circulation, everything. In this way society\nconstructs us as biologically, as well as socially, gendered people.\n(Hubbard 1990: 138)  \nIt is also significant that not all social kinds are obviously social.\nSometimes it is assumed that the conditions for membership in a kind\nconcern only or primarily biological or physical facts. Pointing out\nthat this is wrong can have important consequences. For example, the\nidea that whether or not a person is white is not simply a matter of\ntheir physical features, but concerns their position in a social\nmatrix, has been politically significant, and to many surprising. How\nshould we construe the constructionist project of arguing that a\nparticular kind is a social kind? What could be interesting or radical\nabout such a project? \nSuppose Sally says “I am a white woman”. What does this\nmean? Suppose we pose these questions to someone who is not a\nphilosopher, someone not familiar with the academic social\nconstructionist literature. A likely response will involve mention of\nher physical features: reproductive organs, skin color, etc. The\ngender and race constructionists will reject this response and will\nargue that what makes the claim apt concerns the social relations in\nwhich she stands. On this construal, the important social\nconstructionist import in Beauvoir’s claim that “one is\nnot born but rather becomes a woman”, (Beauvoir 1949) is not\nthat one is caused to be feminine by social forces; rather, the\nimportant insight was that being a woman is not an anatomical matter\nbut a social matter. \nBecause being a woman is a social matter, if we allow that social\nphenomena are highly variable across time, cultures, groups, then this\nalso allows us to recognize that the specific details of it is to be a\nwoman will differ depending on one’s race, ethnicity, class,\netc. Sally’s being a woman occurs in a context in which she is\nalso white and privileged; her actual social position will therefore\nbe affected by multiple factors simultaneously. She learned the norms\nof WASP womanhood, not Black womanhood. And even if she rejected many\nof those norms, she benefits from the fact that they are broadly\naccepted. \nThe social constructionist’s goal is often to challenge the\nappearance of inevitability of the category in question; as things are\narranged now, there are men and women, and people of different races.\nBut if social conditions changed substantially, there would be no men\nand women, and no people of different races. It would be possible,\nthen, to do away with the conceptual frameworks that we currently use.\nBut an important first step is to make the category visible as a\nsocial as opposed to physical category. This sometimes requires a\nrather radical change in our thinking. \nIt is worth keeping in mind, also, that constitutive social\nconstructionist projects offer a metaphysics of the category in\nquestion, i.e., an answer to the question what the nature of the\ncategory is. Causal constructionist projects do not do that, but\nrather cast light on the ways in which social practices are implicated\nas the causes or effects of phenomena (Ásta Sveinsdóttir\n2015). \nConsiderable amount of recent work has focused on the metaphysics of\nsocial kinds and social properties more generally (Frye 2011; Mikkola\n2006, 2011; Stoljar 2011; Ásta Sveinsdóttir 2011; Witt\n2011a,c). There has also been a lot of attention given to accounts of\ngender. We turn to that now. \nWhile the question of what gender is has always been a central\nquestion for feminism and feminist theory, it has received increased\nattention in recent years. We will discuss why an account of gender is\nimportant for feminist theory and point out how any theorizing is\nalways situated in a political landscape that is both spatially and\ntemporally bounded. The examples we will use are two recent book\nlength treatments of gender, by Sally Haslanger and Charlotte Witt;\nboth offer accounts of the metaphysics of gender, i.e., of the nature\nof gender categories. We will also mention in passing some other\nrecent accounts, but for a fuller discussion of gender see Mikkola\n2016a.  \nThe aim of feminism is, in the most general terms, to end the\noppression of women. The goal of feminist theory is, therefore, to\ntheorize how women are oppressed and how we can work towards ending\nit. But what is this group women? Whose oppression is the\nmovement aiming to end? For articulating the various ways in which\nwomen are oppressed, there is a need for a working definition of what\nit is to be a woman (for a contrary view see Mikkola 2016b). But the\nvarious accounts of the different dimensions (social, economical,\npsychological, etc.) of the oppression of women may in fact call for\ndifferent accounts of gender. It is, therefore, not always clear that\nseemingly incompatible accounts of gender are in fact incompatible.\nThey may in fact often be answering different questions.  \nLet’s go back to Simone de Beauvoir’s words, “One is\nnot born a woman, but rather becomes one”. On this picture, one\nis born biologically female or male and slowly becomes socialized into\na woman or man. What is the relationship between sex and gender here?\nThe slogan used by feminists since the seventies, as mentioned before,\nis gender is the social meaning of sex and gender is thought\nto be a social construction. \nSally Haslanger embraces the slogan gender is the social meaning\nof sex and the conception of gender that she offers is to do\njustice to that slogans (Haslanger 2012). While she discusses many\nways something can be socially constructed, a central conception of\nsocial construction she is aiming to articulate is one that makes\nsense of that slogan. Here is her account of gender (Haslanger 2012:\n234): \nS is a woman if and only if \nS is a man if and only if \nGenders are socially constructed constitutively. To be of a gender is\nto have a place in a hierarchical structure and genders are\nconstituted by the hierarchical power relations. So here we have an\naccount of constitutive construction: genders are social statuses\nconstituted by hierarchical power relations. How does this do justice\nto the aforementioned slogan? To be of a certain gender is to be taken\nto have bodily features presumed to be evidence of a role in\nbiological reproduction and occupy a hierarchical social position\nbecause of that. \nHaslanger’s account of the social construction of gender is an\nanswer to the question what type of thing genders are, how they are\ncreated and maintained. According to her account, genders are social\nstatuses within a hierarchical social structure and not, for example,\nbiological categories. On her view, when offering a theory of\nsomething, be it gender or something else, we always have to ask what\nwe want the theory for: what questions is the theory supposed to\nanswer, what bring to light? And a theory is always a child of its\nmaker, and their time and place, and is offered in the context of the\nconversations and political and activist struggles that are taking\nplace then. For instance, Haslanger first articulated her theory of\ngender in 1995–1996, and wanted to give an account that\ndidn’t define women in terms of some intrinsic (biological or\npsychological) trait, but rather, in the materialist feminist\ntradition, considered women to be a social class. The aim was to\nhighlight certain structural injustices we are all party to, but not\nto give an account of gender to settle all questions regarding gender.\nA structural account differs in aims from one that has as its central\ntarget to capture people’s own conceptions of their experience.\nFor critical engagements with Haslanger’s theory, it is helpful\nto begin with Mills 2014, Jones 2014, Haslanger 2014, Mikkola 2016a,\nand Bettcher 2012. \nCharlotte Witt offers an account of gender in her recent book, The\nMetaphysics of Gender (2011c) that draws on Aristotle as well as\nfeminist theory. The chief aim of Witt’s account is to give a\nmetaphysics of gender that can elucidate the centrality of gender in\nour lived experience and she develops a framework to make sense of\nthat centrality. Her claim is that as a matter of fact, in western\nlate-capitalist societies like the United States, gender is\nuniessential to social individuals. Let us flesh this out\n(here we draw on Ásta Sveinsdóttir 2012).  \nFirst, for a function to be uniessential to an entity is for it to\nunify and organize all the parts of that individual into the whole\nthat is the individual. For example, the time-telling function unifies\nand organizes all the tiny metal parts (hands, spring, gears, etc)\ninto the whole which is the watch itself. Similarly, the sheltering\nfunction unifies and organizes all the planks of a wooden house into\nthe entity that is the house itself. \nGender, understood in this way, is a function that organizes all the\nparts of a social individual into the social individual it is. The\nparts in question are all the other social roles the social individual\noccupies: parent, friend, professor, child, colleague, etc. Gender\n(man, woman) is a mega social role that unifies all the other\nsocial roles into the agent that is the social individual. Being a\nwoman, a parent, etc, is to occupy a social position, with which come\nnorms of behavior. The social individual is the entity that occupies\nall these social positions, the bearer of these social properties, if\nyou will. \nThe social individual is distinct from the human organism and\nthe person because the social individual stands in social\nrelations essentially, but human organisms and persons do so only\naccidentally. Similarly, the person is distinct from the human\norganism and the social individual because the person has the capacity\nto take a first person perspective on itself essentially, but the\nhuman organism and the social individual only have that accidentally.\nFinally, the human organism has certain biological features\nessentially, but the person and the social individual does so only\naccidentally. For critical engagements with Witt’s theory, it is\nhelpful to begin with Cudd 2012, Mikkola 2012, and Ásta\nSveinsdóttir 2012. \nThere are a number of other recent accounts of gender. We mention some\nhere briefly. For a fuller discussion, see Mikkola 2016a. \nNatalie Stoljar (1995) argues that the concept of gender is a cluster\nconcept. There are no features that all and only women share; rather\nthe concept of woman stands for a cluster of features and one can be a\nwoman in virtue of having one or more of these features. Linda Alcoff\n(2006) argues that gender is a position in a network of social and\ncultural institutions and ideologies. The gender position one occupies\nis defined by the possibilities one has with regard to biological\nreproduction. Ásta Sveinsdóttir (2011, 2013) offers a\nradically contextual account of gender, on which gender is a\nconferred social status. In different contexts different\nfeatures serve as base features for the conferral of gender (role in\nbiological reproduction, sexual role, self-identification, etc.).\nTheodore Bach (2012)\nargues that genders are natural kinds with a historical essence. To be\na woman, on his view, is to be produced in the right way, have the\nright lineage. A woman has the right lineage if she is the product of\n“ontogenetic processes through which a historical gender system\nreplicates women” (Bach 2012: 271). Jennifer McKitrick (2015)\nargues that gender is a dispositional property. One is of a certain\ngender just in case one is disposed to behave in certain ways in\ncertain situations. Following Haslanger 2012, Katharine Jenkins (2016)\ngives an ameliorative account of gender, but one in which there are\ntwo target concepts: gender as class and gender as identity. \nIt is important to keep in mind when approaching the literature on\ngender that different theorists have different aims in mind when\noffering a theory of gender, and different phenomena that the accounts\nare to capture. Some want to capture something about lived experience,\nothers highlight certain dimensions of injustice. For instance, while\ngender is a social position for both Witt and Haslanger, in our brief\ndiscussion we see that they are focused on different things in\ndeveloping their accounts. Witt is focused on the centrality of gender\nand gender norms in our lived experience; Haslanger on structural\ngender oppression. Also, some theorists approach gender by giving an\naccount of the (or a) concept of gender, others how certain words get\nused. Still others offer a real definition, a definition of the\nphenomenon itself, as opposed to a concept of it, or words used to\nrefer to it. Yet others focus on gender identity. How all these\nprojects are related and whether they do conflict may not be evident\nat first glance. \nThe previous section outlined ways in which feminists have\nproblematized the idea that particular categories are\n“natural”. Similarly, feminists have problematized the\nidea that particular categories are intrinsic or non-relational. The\ncritical charge, stated very generally, is that dominant frameworks\nfor representing the world, especially the social world, purport to\nclassify things on the basis of intrinsic properties when in fact the\nclassifications are crucially dependent on relational\n properties.[6] \nThere are two forms of this critique, and correspondingly, two kinds\nof response. On the first form, the charge is that dominant frameworks\nmisrepresent their subject matter by ignoring important relational\naspects of what they purport to be talking about. For example,\nfeminists have long charged that philosophical conceptions of the\nself, e.g., the conception of the independent rational self-regulator,\nare framed in atomistic terms, ignoring our inevitable and valuable\ndependence on each other. In response, feminists have urged us to\nrecognize and revalue the complexity of subjectivity not addressed in\nmodels of rational agency, and to incorporate in our understanding of\nthe self facts about the realities of human dependence and\ninterdependence for which women have been primarily responsible\n(Meyers 1997; Kittay 1999; Stoljar 2015; Willett et al. 2016). \nThe second form of such critique also alleges that the dominant\nframeworks misrepresent their subject matter by obscuring what’s\nrelational. However, the goal is not to capture and revalue the\nbackground relations as in the first form of this critique, but to\nchallenge them. In the cases in question, the charge is that although\nthe system of classification appears to be sorting individuals on the\nbasis of intrinsic properties, in fact there are invidious relations\nthat are being masked by these appearances (Flax 1986: 199–202).\nJust as there are reasons why dominant frameworks construct myths\nabout what’s natural to justify subordinating practices,\nlikewise they construct myths about what’s intrinsic. \nConsider again Beauvoir’s claim that “He is the Subject,\nhe is the Absolute—she is the Other”. Part of what is at\nstake in Beauvoir’s conception of women as Other is the idea\nthat our conceptions of gender and of the self are implicitly\nrelational, e.g., although it may seem that we can define what it is\nto be a woman without reference to men, in fact we cannot (Wittig\n1992; MacKinnon 1989; Haslanger 1993). For Beauvoir, very roughly,\nwomen are those positioned as “Absolute Other”, i.e., as\n“Other” in relation to a group counting as\n“Subject” where the relation between these two groups\nnever reverses so the “Other” becomes\n“Subject” (Beauvoir [1949] 1989: xxii, also\nxv–xxxiv). So, to be a woman is to stand in a complex set of\nsocial (and hierarchical) relations to men (mutatis mutandis\nfor men). And to be a Subject is to stand in a complex set of social\nrelations to some group of Others. For a nuanced recent account of\nBeauvoir’s view of subjectification and objectification’s\nrole in that see Bauer 2011. \nThese particular claims of Beauvoir’s are, of course,\ncontroversial and would need further argument to be made plausible;\nbut the claims are less important than the general idea that\nrelations, especially social relations, are sometimes obscured by our\nordinary frameworks for thinking of things. This is of special\ninterest to feminists (and antiracists) for reasons linked to those we\nhave for questioning the representation of a category as\n“natural”. Begin with a background assumption that social\nlife cannot help but accommodate what’s “natural”.\nWe then can contribute to some category’s appearing\n“natural” by supposing that the basis for membership in\nthe category is intrinsic (thus obscuring the social relations that\nare the real basis for membership). In this context, pressure to\nchange or abolish the category seems unreasonable. \nThese critiques raised invite us to ask: how should we\nre-conceptualize the self and other parts of our social ontology? What\nis the relation between intrinsicness and naturalness? On what basis\ncan we claim that one framework is “masking” another? \nIn the previous section we outlined a project of\n“uncovering” relations in apparently non-relational\nframeworks. In the sort of cases we had in mind what’s\n“uncovered” are concrete social relations, e.g., relations\nof sexual subordination. However, Beauvoir’s claims about\nSubject and Other point to additional insights not yet explored. \nIn saying that “He is the Subject, he is the Absolute—She\nis the Other”, part of Beauvoir’s point is that although\nit may appear that our distinction between subjects and non-subjects\nis a purely descriptive demarcation of a specific category of\nsubstances (selves), in fact, the distinction in use is normative and\nnon-substantive. Begin with the issue of substances: one of the\ntraditional characteristics of substances is that substances do not\nhave opposites, i.e., there is no opposite of horse (non-horse does\nnot count as an opposite). This is in contrast to many qualities:\nlong/short, inside/outside, loud/quiet. One way of explicating\nBeauvoir’s suggestion is that once we look at the conditions for\nsubjecthood, we see that there is an opposite to being a subject:\nsubjects are, for example, free and autonomous persons, and the\nopposite of a free and autonomous person is someone unfree, in her\nterms, someone condemned to immanence. Moreover, it is not only the\ncase that being a subject has an opposite, but that the opposition in\nquestion carries normative weight—so much so that the devalued\nside of the opposition (the Other) is denied reality in its own terms:\nwhat it is to be Other just is to be opposite to the Subject. \nAgain the feminist project is one of unmasking certain ordinary\nassumptions about our classifications of things: the category of\nSubject is not—ontologically speaking—what it may seem.\nMore specifically, categories that appear to be descriptive may in\nfact be functioning normatively; and categories that appear to be\nsubstantive, may in fact be functioning as one end of a qualitative\nspectrum. Although Beauvoir’s example has us focus on the notion\nof a subject or self; feminists have explored the same form of\nargument with other notions, notably, sex, gender, and race. \nThere are two significant consequences of this sort of analysis.\nFirst, with substances, it is standardly supposed that you are a\nmember of the kind or not and there is no middle ground: you are a\nhorse or you aren’t. (Because there is no opposite or contrary\nto horse, the only negative option a contradictory.) Again we can\ncontrast this with other opposites: there is a middle ground between\nlong/short, inside/outside, loud/quiet; and some things avoid the\nopposition altogether, e.g., my coffee mug is neither loud nor quiet.\nCasting a category as substantial, then, limits the available\ncategories for classification. For example, suppose we understand\n‘male’ substantively. If males are a substance kind, then\neverything is either male or not-male, with no middle-ground. But if,\nin practice, ‘not-male’ actually functions as a way of\npicking out females, then it would seem that everything must be either\nmale or female, and there can be no space for genuine categories of\npeople who are intersexed, or other-sexed, or for refusing to sex\npeople at all. One strategy, then, for undermining the idea that a\ncategory is substantival is to highlight the multiplicity of\nindividuals and categories “in between” the primary\ncategory and its implicit opposite. Category proliferation—the\ngeneration of a continuum or genuinely “mixed”\ncategories—can loosen the grip of substantival assumptions\n(Butler 1987; Lugones 1994; Haraway 1988; Zack 1995). \nSecond, in the case of substance kinds, those things that are not in\nthe kind don’t themselves form a kind of their own. They are\nwhat’s “left over”. The class of all things that are\nnot-horses includes computers, stars, dust, basketballs, people, etc.\nSo, if we elide ‘not man’ and ‘woman’, then\nwomen are not read as a kind. As Marilyn Frye puts it, \nWhen woman is defined as not-man, she is cast into the infinite\nundifferentiated plenum…[this partly explains why] many men can\nso naturally speak in parallel constructions of their cars and their\nwomen, and say things like, “It’s my house, my wife, and\nmy money, and the government can’t tell me what to do about any\nof it”. It also illuminates the fact that women are so easily\nassociated with disorder, chaos, irrationality, and\nimpurity….There are no categories in not-man; it is a buzzing\nbooming confusion. (Frye 1996: 1000)  \nFrye’s strategy is not to challenge the substantive status of\nthe man-kind by proliferation, but to challenge its hegemony in the\nspace of persons. So she proposes the construction of a woman-kind\nthat is defined in its own terms, not simply by opposition to men (see\nSchor & Weed 1994). She argues, among other things, that this will\nrequire a recognition of real differences not only between men and\nwomen, but among\n women.[7] \nThis barely scratches the surface of feminist discussion of the\ndualisms that guide our thinking, both in philosophy and common sense.\nThese include mind/body, reason/emotion (Jaggar 1989; Scheman 1993;\nRooney 1993, 1994; Campbell 1998), nature/culture (Ortner 1972; Butler\n1993), freedom/necessity (Mackenzie & Stoljar 2000; Hirschmann\n2003; Holroyd 2011), agent/patient (Meyers 2004a,b). However, it does,\nhopefully, provide some introduction to the feminist issues that arise\nin thinking about classification, substances, dichotomy, and the\npotential political import of ontology and the prime importance of the\nquestion of value ladenness and attention to ideology in feminist\ntheorizing (Alcoff 2011; Haslanger 2011; Janack 2011). \nThere are a couple of over-arching questions that are worth raising\nnow with a (brief) overview in place. The outline offered here\nsuggests that in a number of different ways feminists are keen to\n“unmask” or “uncover” or\n“demythologize” certain aspects of our ordinary (and\nphilosophical) thinking. Where ordinarily we take ourselves to be\ndealing with an ontology of substances, natural things, intrinsic\nproperties, we’re in fact dealing with an ontology of social\nthings, relations, and non-substantive (and often normative) kinds.\nBut what is the relationship between these sorts of\n“unmasking” projects and projects that count as part of\n“mainstream” philosophy, or more specifically,\n“mainstream” metaphysics? So much analytic metaphysics\nconsists in “reconstructions” of our ordinary concepts; a\nsignificant amount of it is unabashedly “revisionary”. So\nalong those lines, feminist metaphysics would seem to fit right in.\nClearly feminist metaphysics differs from the mainstream in its\nsubject matter and background assumptions, in particular in its focus\non the possible value ladenness of our concepts, categories and\ntheories, and its attention to the potential harms of justificatory\nideologies. But are there more substantial differences? Is feminist\nmetaphysics just “mainstream” metaphysics directed at\ndifferent issues, or is there a deep difference? And if there is a\ndeep difference, what exactly is it? Barnes and Mikkola have recently\ncharged that certain prevalent conceptions of metaphysics in\nnon-feminist circles even rule out feminist metaphysics. The charge is\nthat prevalent conceptions of metaphysics in mainstream metaphysics\ntake metaphysics to be concerned with the basic structure of reality\nand what is “fundamental”, where it is assumed that social\nreality cannot be fundamental or basic (Barnes 2014, forthcoming;\nMikkola forthcoming). Jonathan Schaffer and Ted Sider have engaged\nwith these charges (Schaffer forthcoming; Sider forthcoming),\nattempting to show that their respective metametaphysical theories\nallow room for feminist metaphysics and metaphysics of the social more\ngenerally.","contact.mail":"shaslang@mit.edu","contact.domain":"mit.edu"},{"date.published":"2007-02-27","date.changed":"2017-08-11","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-metaphysics/","author1":"Sally Haslanger","author1.info":"http://www.mit.edu/~shaslang/home/About_Me.html","author2.info":"http://online.sfsu.edu/asta/","entry":"feminism-metaphysics","body.text":"\n\n\nMetaphysics is the study of the basic structure of reality, of what\nthere is and what it is like. It considers, for example, concepts such\nas identity, causation, substance, and\nkind, that seem to be presupposed by any form of inquiry; and\nit attempts to determine what there is at the most general level. For\nexample, are there minds in addition to bodies? Do things persist\nthrough change? Is there freewill or is all action determined by prior\nevents? But since metaphysics not only concerns itself with what there\nis (ontology), but also the nature of that which exists,\nmetaphysicians ask, for example, whether numbers, if they exist, are\ndependent upon human thought and practices in some way, whether the\nconcepts and categories we use to think of and describe reality\ninfluence or determine in any way what is described, and whether and\nhow values are embodied in our categories and descriptions. It should\nthus not come as a surprise that there could be a specifically\nfeminist metaphysics, where the question of prime importance is to\nwhat extent the central concepts and categories of metaphysics, in\nterms of which we make sense of our reality, could be value laden in\nways that are particularly gendered.\n\n\nIn this way, feminist theorists have asked whether and, if so, to what\nextent our frameworks for understanding the world are distorting in\nways that privilege men or masculinity. What, if anything, is eclipsed\nif we adopt an Aristotelian framework of substance and essence, or a\nCartesian framework of immaterial souls present in material bodies?\nAnd is what’s left out of such frameworks relevant to the\ndevaluation or oppression of women? Feminists have also considered the\nstructure of social reality and the relationship between the social\nworld and the natural world. Because social structures are often\njustified as natural, or necessary to control what’s natural,\nfeminists have questioned whether such references to nature are\nlegitimate. This has led to considerable work on the idea of social\nconstruction and, more specifically, the social construction of\ngender.\n\nSpeaking very generally, the project of feminist metaphysics asks:\nHave metaphysical claims about what there is, and what it is like,\nsupported sexism, and if so, how? Are there particular metaphysical\nassumptions or patterns of inference that feminists should challenge\n(or endorse)? Replies to these questions have offered critiques and\nreconstructions of concepts for thinking about, e.g., the self (Meyers\n1997, 2004a; Willett, Anderson, & Meyers 2016), sex and sexuality\n(Butler 1987, 1990, 1993; Fausto-Sterling 2000), mind and body (Bordo\n1987, 1993; Young 1990; Scheman 1993; Gatens 1996; Wendell 1996;\nSchiebinger 2000), nature (Lloyd 1984; Haraway1991; Butler 1993;\nWarren 1997), essence (Witt 1993, 1995, 2011b,c; Schor & Weed\n1994; Stoljar 1995), identity (Spelman 1988; Lugones 1994; Young 1994;\nFrye 1996; Lindemann Nelson 2001; Alcoff 2006; Warnke 2008;\nHeinämaa 2011; Lindemann 2014), and objectification (Papadaki 2015).\nFeminists have also questioned whether metaphysics is a legitimate\nform of inquiry at all, raising epistemological questions about, e.g.,\nfoundationalist assumptions implicit in metaphysical inquiry (Irigaray\n1985; Flax 1986; Fraser & Nicholson 1990; Haslanger 2000a). We\nwill focus here on the former set of issues, mentioning methodological\nand epistemological questions only in passing. \nTo begin an overview of feminist metaphysics in this century, it is\nhelpful to return to Simone de Beauvoir’s classic work The\nSecond Sex (Beauvoir 1949). Two of her most famous claims appear\nto have profound metaphysical implications: “One is not born,\nbut rather becomes, a woman”, (Beauvoir [1949] 1989: 267) and\n“He is the Subject, he is the Absolute—she is the\nOther” (Beauvoir [1949] 1989: xxviii). There is disagreement\nabout how to interpret both claims, yet to many the former serves as\nthe slogan for the view that gender is socially constructed, and the\nlatter identifies the content of feminine construction as what is\nopposed to the masculine, the masculine also being what counts as the\nsubject or self. Three interconnected themes prominent in feminist\nmetaphysics emerge here: (i) the social construction of gender (and\nother categories), (ii) the relational nature of the self (and other\ncategories), (iii) the dangers of dualistic thinking. We will conclude\nby mentioning the challenges feminist metaphysics poses to the content\nand practice of mainstream metaphysics. \nIn claiming that one is not born a woman, Beauvoir was not suggesting\nthat one is never born with female body parts; rather, her concern was\nthat possession of female (or male) body parts, in and of itself, does\nnot imply how one could or should be socially\n situated.[1]\n In spite of this, societies, for the most part, reserve for females\ncertain social roles, norms, and activities that disadvantage them in\nrelation to males, casting the differences as necessary because\nnatural (Beauvoir [1949] 1989: Ch.1). If it is recognized, as Beauvoir\nurged, that what women and men are is at least partly a social matter,\nthis opens up the possibility that gender roles could be and so should\nbe made more equitable through social change. To simplify discussion,\nwe will use the terms ‘male’/‘female’ to mark\nthe currently familiar sex distinction drawn in terms of primary and\nsecondary sex characteristics, and\n‘man’/‘woman’ to mark the gender distinction,\nwhere gender is, according to the slogan, “the social meaning of\nsex”. \nThis theme—that social hierarchies are sustained through myths\nof their natural basis—has prompted a tremendous amount of work\non the construction of gender in particular (Delphy 1984; Scott 1986;\nMacKinnon 1989; Butler 1990; Wittig 1992; Alcoff 2006; Warnke 2008;\nWitt 2011a,c; Haslanger 2012), but also on the construction of other\n“naturalized” social categories such as race (Appiah 1996;\nZack 2002; Warnke 2008) and in a somewhat different way, sexuality\n(Butler 1990, 1993; Fausto-Sterling 2000). Research in history,\nanthropology, literature, and sociology has chronicled the various\nmechanisms by which gender (and other such categories) is enforced,\nand research in psychology and biology has further loosened the ties\nbetween body types and social roles. Having witnessed the power of\nnaturalizing “myths”, feminists tend to be wary of any\nsuggestion that a category is “natural” or that\nwhat’s “natural” should dictate how we organize\nourselves socially. However, there are several different\nde-naturalizing projects that are often mistaken for each other that\nengage different sorts of metaphysical issues. \nIt is important to distinguish first the construction of ideas and the\nconstruction of\n objects[2]\n (Hacking 1999: 9–16). Let’s start with ideas. On one\nreading, the claim that an idea or a concept is only possible within\nand due to a social context is utterly obvious. It would seem to be a\nmatter of common sense that concepts are taught to us by our parents\nthrough our language; different cultures have different concepts (that\ngo along with their different languages); and concepts evolve over\ntime as a result of historical changes, science, technological\nadvances, etc. Let’s (albeit contentiously) call this the\n“ordinary view” of concepts and ideas. Even someone who\nbelieves that our scientific concepts perfectly map\n“nature’s joints” can allow that scientists come to\nhave the ideas and concepts they do through social-historical\nprocesses. After all, social and cultural forces (including, possibly,\nthe practices and methods of science) may help us develop concepts\nthat are apt or accurate, and beliefs that are true. \nWe may sometimes forget that what and how we think is affected by\nsocial forces because our experiences seem to be caused simply and\ndirectly by world itself. However, it does not take much prompting to\nrecall that our culture is largely responsible for the interpretive\ntools we bring to the world in order to understand it. Once\nwe’ve noted that our experience of the world is already an\ninterpretation of it, we can begin to raise questions about the\nadequacy of our conceptual framework. Concepts help us organize\nphenomena; different concepts organize it in different ways. It is\nimportant, then, to ask: what phenomena are highlighted and what are\neclipsed by a particular framework of concepts? What assumptions\nprovide structure for the framework? \nFor example, our everyday framework for thinking about human beings is\nstructured by the assumptions that there are two (and only two) sexes,\nand that every human is either a male or a female. But in fact a\nsignificant percentage of humans have a mix of male and female\nanatomical features. Intersexed bodies are eclipsed in our everyday\nframework (Fausto-Sterling 2000). This should invite us to ask: Why?\nWhose interests are served, if anyone’s, by the intersexed being\nignored in the dominant conceptual framework? (It can’t be\nplausibly argued that sex isn’t important enough to us to make\nfine-grained distinctions between bodies!) Further, once we recognize\nthe intersexed, how should we revise our conceptual framework? Should\nwe group bodies into more than two sexes, or are there reasons instead\nto complicate the definitions of male and female to include everyone\nin just two sex categories? More generally, on what basis should we\ndecide what categories to use? (Fausto-Sterling 2000; Butler 1990: Ch.\n1) What is the proper scope of application of these categories? In\nasking these questions it is important to remember that an idea or\nconceptual framework may be inadequate without being false, e.g., a\nclaim might be true and yet incomplete, misleading, unjustified,\nbiased, etc. (Anderson 1995). \nSaying that this or that idea is socially constructed may just be an\ninvitation to recall the ordinary view of concepts and note the\nmotivations behind and limitations of our current framework. Every\nframework will have some limits; the issue is whether the limits\neclipse something that, given the (legitimate) goals of our inquiry,\nmatters. However, sometimes a social constructionist is making a more\ncontroversial claim. The suggestion would be that something or other\nis “merely” a social construction, in other words, that\nwhat we are taking to be real is only a fiction, an idea that fails to\ncapture reality. Feminists have argued, for example, that certain\nmental “disorders” that have been used to diagnose\nbattered women are merely social constructions. Andrea Westlund points\nout how \n[b]attered women’s “abnormalities” have been\ndescribed and redescribed within the psychiatric literature of the\ntwentieth century, characterized as everything from hysteria to\nmasochistic or self-defeating personality disorders (SDPD) to\ncodependency (Herman 1992, 116–118; Tavris 1992,\n170–207). Moreover, such pathologies measure, classify, and\ndefine battered women’s deviance not just from\n“normal” female behavior but also from universalized male\nnorms of independence and self-interest. (Westlund 1999,\n1050–1)  \nSuch diagnoses invite us to explain domestic violence by reference to\nthe woman’s psychological state rather than the batterer’s\nneed for power and control; they also “deflect attention from\nthe social and political aspects of domestic violence to the private\nneuroses to which women as a group are thought to be prone”\n(Westlund 1999: 1051). Westlund and others have argued that although\nvictims of domestic violence often do suffer from psychological\nconditions, e.g., major depression, there is a range of gender coded\nmental disorders included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\nMental Disorder (DSM) for which there is little, if any, good\nevidence. These diagnoses, it could be claimed, are merely social\nconstructions in the sense that they are ideas used to interpret and\nregulate social phenomena, but do not describe anything real. Applying\nthis to the case at hand would entail that “Self-Defeating\nPersonality Disorder” doesn’t really exist. The\ndescription of SDPD does not capture a mental disorder of the sort\n alleged.[3] \nSo in considering the claim that something is socially constructed, we\nshould ask first: Is it an object or an idea? If it is an idea, then\nwe should raise a series of epistemological questions, e.g., are we\njustified in employing this idea as we do, and metaphysical questions,\ne.g., is there anything real corresponding to the idea, or is it a\nfiction? Social constructionists often begin by noticing that an idea\nis functioning socially to support an unjust institution and then\nconsider how that idea functions within a broader framework of ideas\nand concepts to structure our experience: does it illegitimately or\ninappropriately privilege one set of phenomena over another? Does it\nobscure some phenomena completely? Does it create an illusion of\ncertain kinds of things? \nOf course in some contexts privileging certain phenomena is useful and\neven necessary: medical sciences are not “neutral” with\nrespect to what phenomena count as significant and how they are\ncategorized; medicine has a legitimate concern with human health and\nthe organisms that affect human health. However, other things being\nequal, medicine that privileges phenomena related to men’s\nhealth or the health of the wealthy would not be epistemically or\npolitically legitimate (Anderson 1995). Considering what is left out\nof a framework of categories, or what assumptions structure it can\nalso reveal biases of many sorts. \nIn some cases of social construction what’s at issue is the\naptness of the classification, in other cases it is whether the\nclassification captures a natural kind or a social kind. In yet\nfurther cases, the point is to reveal that classification does not\ndescribe anything real at all and, instead, is just a fiction being\ntreated as real. In such cases, substantial work must be done to\ndemonstrate that the idea in question is only a fiction. But\nthat’s not all, for we should also ask: How are such distortions\nand fictions established and maintained? Whose interests do they\nserve? \nNow consider objects (understanding ‘objects’ in the\nbroadest sense as virtually anything that’s not an idea). There\nis a sense in which any artifact is a construction; but claiming that\nscissors or cars are social constructions would not have much point,\ngiven how mundane this claim would be. Social constructionists, on the\nwhole, are arguing for a surprising thesis that they believe\nchallenges our everyday view of things. It is much more surprising to\nsay that women or Asian-Americans, homosexuals, child abusers, or\nrefugees, are social constructions. What could this mean? \nIn considering the construction of objects, the first point to note is\nthat our classificatory schemes, at least in social contexts, may do\nmore than just map pre-existing groups of individuals; rather our\nattributions have the power to both establish and reinforce groupings\nwhich may eventually come to “fit” the classifications.\nThis works in several ways. Forms of description or classification\nprovide for kinds of intention; e.g., given the classification\n“cool”, we can set about to become cool, or avoid being\ncool, etc. But also, such classifications can function in justifying\nbehavior; e.g., “we didn’t invite him because he’s\nnot cool”, and such justifications, in turn, can reinforce the\ndistinction between those who are cool and those who are uncool.\nDrawing on Ian Hacking’s work, Haslanger has referred to this as\n“discursive” construction: \nDiscursive construction: something is discursively\nconstructed just in case it is (to a significant extent) the way it is\nbecause of what is attributed to it or how it is classified.\n(Haslanger 1995: 99)  \nAdmittedly, the idea here is quite vague (e.g., how much is “a\nsignificant extent”?). However, social construction in this\nsense is ubiquitous. Each of us is socially constructed in this sense\nbecause we are (to a significant extent) the individuals we are today\nas a result of what has been attributed and self-attributed to us. For\nexample, being classified as able-bodied females from birth has\nprofoundly affected the paths available to us in life and the sort of\npersons we have become. \nNote, however, that to say that an entity is “discursively\nconstructed” is not to say that language or discourse brings a\nmaterial object into existence de novo. Rather something in\nexistence comes to have—partly as a result of having been\ncategorized in a certain way—a set of features that qualify it\nas a member of a certain kind or\n sort.[4]\n Someone’s having been categorized as a female at birth (and\nconsistently since then) has been a factor in how she has been viewed\nand treated; these views and treatments have, in turn, played an\nimportant causal role in her becoming gendered as a woman. For\nexample, let us suppose for current purposes that being gendered as a\nwoman is to occupy in one’s social context a broad role\nassociated with female reproductive capacities. It is through a\nprocess of socialization—being viewed and treated as a\ngirl—that she learned, and eventually internalized, what the\n“proper” role for females is and how to mark herself as\noccupying it. So she learned that girls only eat so much, only play\nsuch games, only wear certain clothes. Whether or not she accepts\nthese norms, negotiating them was the process by which she became a\nwoman; but discourse didn’t bring her into existence. \nIt would appear that gender (in different senses) is both an\nidea-construction and an object-construction. Gender is an\nidea-construction because the classification men/women is the\ncontingent result of historical events and forces. As we saw above,\nthe everyday distinction between males and females leaves out the\nintersexed population that might have been given its own sex/gender\ncategory. Arguably, in fact, some cultures have divided bodies into\nthree sexual/reproductive groups. At the same time the classifications\n‘woman’ and ‘man’ are what Hacking calls\n“interactive kinds”: gender classifications occur within a\ncomplex matrix of institutions and practices, and being classified as\na woman (or not), or a man (or not), or third, fourth, fifth\nsex/gender or not, has a profound effect on an individual. Such\nclassification will have a material effect on one’s social\nposition as well as affect one’s experience and\nself-understanding. In this sense, women and men—concrete\nindividuals—are constructed as gendered kinds of people, i.e.,\nwe are each object constructions (see Ásta Sveinsdóttir\n2015 for further details). \nThere is yet a further sense in which something might be a social\nconstruction. So far we’ve been focusing on social causation: to\nsay that something is socially constructed is to say that it is caused\nto be a certain way, and the causal process involves social factors,\ne.g., social forces were largely responsible for my coming to have the\nidea of a husband, and social forces were largely responsible for\nthere being husbands. But often when theorists argue that something is\na social construction the point is not about causation. Rather, the\npoint is to distinguish social kinds from physical kinds. In the case\nof gender, the point is that gender is not a classification scheme\nbased simply on anatomical or biological differences, but marks social\ndifferences between individuals. Gender, as opposed to sex, is not\nabout testicles and ovaries, the penis and the uterus, but about a\nsystem of social categories (see, e.g., Haslanger 1993, 2000b; also\nWittig 1992; Delphy 1984; MacKinnon 1989). \nConsider, for example, the category of landlords. To be a landlord one\nmust be located within a broad system of social and economic relations\nwhich includes tenants, private property, and the like. It might be\nthat all and only landlords have a mole behind their left ear. But\neven if this were the case, having this physical mark is not what it\nis to be a landlord. Similarly, one might want to draw a distinction\nbetween sex and gender, sex being an anatomical distinction based on\nlocally salient sexual/reproductive differences (see Ásta\nSveinsdóttir 2011 for an alternative conception), and gender\nbeing a distinction between the social/political positions of those\nwith bodies marked as of different sexes. One could allow that the\ncategories of sex and gender interact (so concerns with distinctions\nbetween bodies will influence social divisions and vice versa); but\neven to be clear how they interact, we should differentiate them. With\nthis distinction between sex and gender in hand, it is possible that\nsome males are women and some females are men. Because, on this\nconception, one is a female by virtue of some (variable) set of\nanatomical features, and one is a woman by virtue of one’s\nposition within a social and economic system, the sex/gender\ndistinction gives us some (at least preliminary) resources for\nincluding trans* people within our conceptual framework (see further\nBettcher 2014). \nIn considering this form of social construction, or we might call it\nsocial constitution, it is important to note that social kinds cannot\nbe equated with things that have social causes. Sociobiologists claim\nthat some social phenomena have biological causes; some feminists\nclaim that anatomical phenomena have social causes, e.g., the gap in\naverage height and strength differences between men and women in a\nparticular context depends on, among other things, gender norms in\nthat context concerning food and\n exercise.[5]\n As Ruth Hubbard explains, \n…we live in dynamic interaction with our environment. Sex\ndifferences are socially constructed because being raised as a girl or\na boy produces biological as well as social differences. Society\ndefines the sex-appropriate behavior to which each of us learns to\nconform, and our behavior affects our bones, muscles, sense organs,\nnerves, brain, lungs, circulation, everything. In this way society\nconstructs us as biologically, as well as socially, gendered people.\n(Hubbard 1990: 138)  \nIt is also significant that not all social kinds are obviously social.\nSometimes it is assumed that the conditions for membership in a kind\nconcern only or primarily biological or physical facts. Pointing out\nthat this is wrong can have important consequences. For example, the\nidea that whether or not a person is white is not simply a matter of\ntheir physical features, but concerns their position in a social\nmatrix, has been politically significant, and to many surprising. How\nshould we construe the constructionist project of arguing that a\nparticular kind is a social kind? What could be interesting or radical\nabout such a project? \nSuppose Sally says “I am a white woman”. What does this\nmean? Suppose we pose these questions to someone who is not a\nphilosopher, someone not familiar with the academic social\nconstructionist literature. A likely response will involve mention of\nher physical features: reproductive organs, skin color, etc. The\ngender and race constructionists will reject this response and will\nargue that what makes the claim apt concerns the social relations in\nwhich she stands. On this construal, the important social\nconstructionist import in Beauvoir’s claim that “one is\nnot born but rather becomes a woman”, (Beauvoir 1949) is not\nthat one is caused to be feminine by social forces; rather, the\nimportant insight was that being a woman is not an anatomical matter\nbut a social matter. \nBecause being a woman is a social matter, if we allow that social\nphenomena are highly variable across time, cultures, groups, then this\nalso allows us to recognize that the specific details of it is to be a\nwoman will differ depending on one’s race, ethnicity, class,\netc. Sally’s being a woman occurs in a context in which she is\nalso white and privileged; her actual social position will therefore\nbe affected by multiple factors simultaneously. She learned the norms\nof WASP womanhood, not Black womanhood. And even if she rejected many\nof those norms, she benefits from the fact that they are broadly\naccepted. \nThe social constructionist’s goal is often to challenge the\nappearance of inevitability of the category in question; as things are\narranged now, there are men and women, and people of different races.\nBut if social conditions changed substantially, there would be no men\nand women, and no people of different races. It would be possible,\nthen, to do away with the conceptual frameworks that we currently use.\nBut an important first step is to make the category visible as a\nsocial as opposed to physical category. This sometimes requires a\nrather radical change in our thinking. \nIt is worth keeping in mind, also, that constitutive social\nconstructionist projects offer a metaphysics of the category in\nquestion, i.e., an answer to the question what the nature of the\ncategory is. Causal constructionist projects do not do that, but\nrather cast light on the ways in which social practices are implicated\nas the causes or effects of phenomena (Ásta Sveinsdóttir\n2015). \nConsiderable amount of recent work has focused on the metaphysics of\nsocial kinds and social properties more generally (Frye 2011; Mikkola\n2006, 2011; Stoljar 2011; Ásta Sveinsdóttir 2011; Witt\n2011a,c). There has also been a lot of attention given to accounts of\ngender. We turn to that now. \nWhile the question of what gender is has always been a central\nquestion for feminism and feminist theory, it has received increased\nattention in recent years. We will discuss why an account of gender is\nimportant for feminist theory and point out how any theorizing is\nalways situated in a political landscape that is both spatially and\ntemporally bounded. The examples we will use are two recent book\nlength treatments of gender, by Sally Haslanger and Charlotte Witt;\nboth offer accounts of the metaphysics of gender, i.e., of the nature\nof gender categories. We will also mention in passing some other\nrecent accounts, but for a fuller discussion of gender see Mikkola\n2016a.  \nThe aim of feminism is, in the most general terms, to end the\noppression of women. The goal of feminist theory is, therefore, to\ntheorize how women are oppressed and how we can work towards ending\nit. But what is this group women? Whose oppression is the\nmovement aiming to end? For articulating the various ways in which\nwomen are oppressed, there is a need for a working definition of what\nit is to be a woman (for a contrary view see Mikkola 2016b). But the\nvarious accounts of the different dimensions (social, economical,\npsychological, etc.) of the oppression of women may in fact call for\ndifferent accounts of gender. It is, therefore, not always clear that\nseemingly incompatible accounts of gender are in fact incompatible.\nThey may in fact often be answering different questions.  \nLet’s go back to Simone de Beauvoir’s words, “One is\nnot born a woman, but rather becomes one”. On this picture, one\nis born biologically female or male and slowly becomes socialized into\na woman or man. What is the relationship between sex and gender here?\nThe slogan used by feminists since the seventies, as mentioned before,\nis gender is the social meaning of sex and gender is thought\nto be a social construction. \nSally Haslanger embraces the slogan gender is the social meaning\nof sex and the conception of gender that she offers is to do\njustice to that slogans (Haslanger 2012). While she discusses many\nways something can be socially constructed, a central conception of\nsocial construction she is aiming to articulate is one that makes\nsense of that slogan. Here is her account of gender (Haslanger 2012:\n234): \nS is a woman if and only if \nS is a man if and only if \nGenders are socially constructed constitutively. To be of a gender is\nto have a place in a hierarchical structure and genders are\nconstituted by the hierarchical power relations. So here we have an\naccount of constitutive construction: genders are social statuses\nconstituted by hierarchical power relations. How does this do justice\nto the aforementioned slogan? To be of a certain gender is to be taken\nto have bodily features presumed to be evidence of a role in\nbiological reproduction and occupy a hierarchical social position\nbecause of that. \nHaslanger’s account of the social construction of gender is an\nanswer to the question what type of thing genders are, how they are\ncreated and maintained. According to her account, genders are social\nstatuses within a hierarchical social structure and not, for example,\nbiological categories. On her view, when offering a theory of\nsomething, be it gender or something else, we always have to ask what\nwe want the theory for: what questions is the theory supposed to\nanswer, what bring to light? And a theory is always a child of its\nmaker, and their time and place, and is offered in the context of the\nconversations and political and activist struggles that are taking\nplace then. For instance, Haslanger first articulated her theory of\ngender in 1995–1996, and wanted to give an account that\ndidn’t define women in terms of some intrinsic (biological or\npsychological) trait, but rather, in the materialist feminist\ntradition, considered women to be a social class. The aim was to\nhighlight certain structural injustices we are all party to, but not\nto give an account of gender to settle all questions regarding gender.\nA structural account differs in aims from one that has as its central\ntarget to capture people’s own conceptions of their experience.\nFor critical engagements with Haslanger’s theory, it is helpful\nto begin with Mills 2014, Jones 2014, Haslanger 2014, Mikkola 2016a,\nand Bettcher 2012. \nCharlotte Witt offers an account of gender in her recent book, The\nMetaphysics of Gender (2011c) that draws on Aristotle as well as\nfeminist theory. The chief aim of Witt’s account is to give a\nmetaphysics of gender that can elucidate the centrality of gender in\nour lived experience and she develops a framework to make sense of\nthat centrality. Her claim is that as a matter of fact, in western\nlate-capitalist societies like the United States, gender is\nuniessential to social individuals. Let us flesh this out\n(here we draw on Ásta Sveinsdóttir 2012).  \nFirst, for a function to be uniessential to an entity is for it to\nunify and organize all the parts of that individual into the whole\nthat is the individual. For example, the time-telling function unifies\nand organizes all the tiny metal parts (hands, spring, gears, etc)\ninto the whole which is the watch itself. Similarly, the sheltering\nfunction unifies and organizes all the planks of a wooden house into\nthe entity that is the house itself. \nGender, understood in this way, is a function that organizes all the\nparts of a social individual into the social individual it is. The\nparts in question are all the other social roles the social individual\noccupies: parent, friend, professor, child, colleague, etc. Gender\n(man, woman) is a mega social role that unifies all the other\nsocial roles into the agent that is the social individual. Being a\nwoman, a parent, etc, is to occupy a social position, with which come\nnorms of behavior. The social individual is the entity that occupies\nall these social positions, the bearer of these social properties, if\nyou will. \nThe social individual is distinct from the human organism and\nthe person because the social individual stands in social\nrelations essentially, but human organisms and persons do so only\naccidentally. Similarly, the person is distinct from the human\norganism and the social individual because the person has the capacity\nto take a first person perspective on itself essentially, but the\nhuman organism and the social individual only have that accidentally.\nFinally, the human organism has certain biological features\nessentially, but the person and the social individual does so only\naccidentally. For critical engagements with Witt’s theory, it is\nhelpful to begin with Cudd 2012, Mikkola 2012, and Ásta\nSveinsdóttir 2012. \nThere are a number of other recent accounts of gender. We mention some\nhere briefly. For a fuller discussion, see Mikkola 2016a. \nNatalie Stoljar (1995) argues that the concept of gender is a cluster\nconcept. There are no features that all and only women share; rather\nthe concept of woman stands for a cluster of features and one can be a\nwoman in virtue of having one or more of these features. Linda Alcoff\n(2006) argues that gender is a position in a network of social and\ncultural institutions and ideologies. The gender position one occupies\nis defined by the possibilities one has with regard to biological\nreproduction. Ásta Sveinsdóttir (2011, 2013) offers a\nradically contextual account of gender, on which gender is a\nconferred social status. In different contexts different\nfeatures serve as base features for the conferral of gender (role in\nbiological reproduction, sexual role, self-identification, etc.).\nTheodore Bach (2012)\nargues that genders are natural kinds with a historical essence. To be\na woman, on his view, is to be produced in the right way, have the\nright lineage. A woman has the right lineage if she is the product of\n“ontogenetic processes through which a historical gender system\nreplicates women” (Bach 2012: 271). Jennifer McKitrick (2015)\nargues that gender is a dispositional property. One is of a certain\ngender just in case one is disposed to behave in certain ways in\ncertain situations. Following Haslanger 2012, Katharine Jenkins (2016)\ngives an ameliorative account of gender, but one in which there are\ntwo target concepts: gender as class and gender as identity. \nIt is important to keep in mind when approaching the literature on\ngender that different theorists have different aims in mind when\noffering a theory of gender, and different phenomena that the accounts\nare to capture. Some want to capture something about lived experience,\nothers highlight certain dimensions of injustice. For instance, while\ngender is a social position for both Witt and Haslanger, in our brief\ndiscussion we see that they are focused on different things in\ndeveloping their accounts. Witt is focused on the centrality of gender\nand gender norms in our lived experience; Haslanger on structural\ngender oppression. Also, some theorists approach gender by giving an\naccount of the (or a) concept of gender, others how certain words get\nused. Still others offer a real definition, a definition of the\nphenomenon itself, as opposed to a concept of it, or words used to\nrefer to it. Yet others focus on gender identity. How all these\nprojects are related and whether they do conflict may not be evident\nat first glance. \nThe previous section outlined ways in which feminists have\nproblematized the idea that particular categories are\n“natural”. Similarly, feminists have problematized the\nidea that particular categories are intrinsic or non-relational. The\ncritical charge, stated very generally, is that dominant frameworks\nfor representing the world, especially the social world, purport to\nclassify things on the basis of intrinsic properties when in fact the\nclassifications are crucially dependent on relational\n properties.[6] \nThere are two forms of this critique, and correspondingly, two kinds\nof response. On the first form, the charge is that dominant frameworks\nmisrepresent their subject matter by ignoring important relational\naspects of what they purport to be talking about. For example,\nfeminists have long charged that philosophical conceptions of the\nself, e.g., the conception of the independent rational self-regulator,\nare framed in atomistic terms, ignoring our inevitable and valuable\ndependence on each other. In response, feminists have urged us to\nrecognize and revalue the complexity of subjectivity not addressed in\nmodels of rational agency, and to incorporate in our understanding of\nthe self facts about the realities of human dependence and\ninterdependence for which women have been primarily responsible\n(Meyers 1997; Kittay 1999; Stoljar 2015; Willett et al. 2016). \nThe second form of such critique also alleges that the dominant\nframeworks misrepresent their subject matter by obscuring what’s\nrelational. However, the goal is not to capture and revalue the\nbackground relations as in the first form of this critique, but to\nchallenge them. In the cases in question, the charge is that although\nthe system of classification appears to be sorting individuals on the\nbasis of intrinsic properties, in fact there are invidious relations\nthat are being masked by these appearances (Flax 1986: 199–202).\nJust as there are reasons why dominant frameworks construct myths\nabout what’s natural to justify subordinating practices,\nlikewise they construct myths about what’s intrinsic. \nConsider again Beauvoir’s claim that “He is the Subject,\nhe is the Absolute—she is the Other”. Part of what is at\nstake in Beauvoir’s conception of women as Other is the idea\nthat our conceptions of gender and of the self are implicitly\nrelational, e.g., although it may seem that we can define what it is\nto be a woman without reference to men, in fact we cannot (Wittig\n1992; MacKinnon 1989; Haslanger 1993). For Beauvoir, very roughly,\nwomen are those positioned as “Absolute Other”, i.e., as\n“Other” in relation to a group counting as\n“Subject” where the relation between these two groups\nnever reverses so the “Other” becomes\n“Subject” (Beauvoir [1949] 1989: xxii, also\nxv–xxxiv). So, to be a woman is to stand in a complex set of\nsocial (and hierarchical) relations to men (mutatis mutandis\nfor men). And to be a Subject is to stand in a complex set of social\nrelations to some group of Others. For a nuanced recent account of\nBeauvoir’s view of subjectification and objectification’s\nrole in that see Bauer 2011. \nThese particular claims of Beauvoir’s are, of course,\ncontroversial and would need further argument to be made plausible;\nbut the claims are less important than the general idea that\nrelations, especially social relations, are sometimes obscured by our\nordinary frameworks for thinking of things. This is of special\ninterest to feminists (and antiracists) for reasons linked to those we\nhave for questioning the representation of a category as\n“natural”. Begin with a background assumption that social\nlife cannot help but accommodate what’s “natural”.\nWe then can contribute to some category’s appearing\n“natural” by supposing that the basis for membership in\nthe category is intrinsic (thus obscuring the social relations that\nare the real basis for membership). In this context, pressure to\nchange or abolish the category seems unreasonable. \nThese critiques raised invite us to ask: how should we\nre-conceptualize the self and other parts of our social ontology? What\nis the relation between intrinsicness and naturalness? On what basis\ncan we claim that one framework is “masking” another? \nIn the previous section we outlined a project of\n“uncovering” relations in apparently non-relational\nframeworks. In the sort of cases we had in mind what’s\n“uncovered” are concrete social relations, e.g., relations\nof sexual subordination. However, Beauvoir’s claims about\nSubject and Other point to additional insights not yet explored. \nIn saying that “He is the Subject, he is the Absolute—She\nis the Other”, part of Beauvoir’s point is that although\nit may appear that our distinction between subjects and non-subjects\nis a purely descriptive demarcation of a specific category of\nsubstances (selves), in fact, the distinction in use is normative and\nnon-substantive. Begin with the issue of substances: one of the\ntraditional characteristics of substances is that substances do not\nhave opposites, i.e., there is no opposite of horse (non-horse does\nnot count as an opposite). This is in contrast to many qualities:\nlong/short, inside/outside, loud/quiet. One way of explicating\nBeauvoir’s suggestion is that once we look at the conditions for\nsubjecthood, we see that there is an opposite to being a subject:\nsubjects are, for example, free and autonomous persons, and the\nopposite of a free and autonomous person is someone unfree, in her\nterms, someone condemned to immanence. Moreover, it is not only the\ncase that being a subject has an opposite, but that the opposition in\nquestion carries normative weight—so much so that the devalued\nside of the opposition (the Other) is denied reality in its own terms:\nwhat it is to be Other just is to be opposite to the Subject. \nAgain the feminist project is one of unmasking certain ordinary\nassumptions about our classifications of things: the category of\nSubject is not—ontologically speaking—what it may seem.\nMore specifically, categories that appear to be descriptive may in\nfact be functioning normatively; and categories that appear to be\nsubstantive, may in fact be functioning as one end of a qualitative\nspectrum. Although Beauvoir’s example has us focus on the notion\nof a subject or self; feminists have explored the same form of\nargument with other notions, notably, sex, gender, and race. \nThere are two significant consequences of this sort of analysis.\nFirst, with substances, it is standardly supposed that you are a\nmember of the kind or not and there is no middle ground: you are a\nhorse or you aren’t. (Because there is no opposite or contrary\nto horse, the only negative option a contradictory.) Again we can\ncontrast this with other opposites: there is a middle ground between\nlong/short, inside/outside, loud/quiet; and some things avoid the\nopposition altogether, e.g., my coffee mug is neither loud nor quiet.\nCasting a category as substantial, then, limits the available\ncategories for classification. For example, suppose we understand\n‘male’ substantively. If males are a substance kind, then\neverything is either male or not-male, with no middle-ground. But if,\nin practice, ‘not-male’ actually functions as a way of\npicking out females, then it would seem that everything must be either\nmale or female, and there can be no space for genuine categories of\npeople who are intersexed, or other-sexed, or for refusing to sex\npeople at all. One strategy, then, for undermining the idea that a\ncategory is substantival is to highlight the multiplicity of\nindividuals and categories “in between” the primary\ncategory and its implicit opposite. Category proliferation—the\ngeneration of a continuum or genuinely “mixed”\ncategories—can loosen the grip of substantival assumptions\n(Butler 1987; Lugones 1994; Haraway 1988; Zack 1995). \nSecond, in the case of substance kinds, those things that are not in\nthe kind don’t themselves form a kind of their own. They are\nwhat’s “left over”. The class of all things that are\nnot-horses includes computers, stars, dust, basketballs, people, etc.\nSo, if we elide ‘not man’ and ‘woman’, then\nwomen are not read as a kind. As Marilyn Frye puts it, \nWhen woman is defined as not-man, she is cast into the infinite\nundifferentiated plenum…[this partly explains why] many men can\nso naturally speak in parallel constructions of their cars and their\nwomen, and say things like, “It’s my house, my wife, and\nmy money, and the government can’t tell me what to do about any\nof it”. It also illuminates the fact that women are so easily\nassociated with disorder, chaos, irrationality, and\nimpurity….There are no categories in not-man; it is a buzzing\nbooming confusion. (Frye 1996: 1000)  \nFrye’s strategy is not to challenge the substantive status of\nthe man-kind by proliferation, but to challenge its hegemony in the\nspace of persons. So she proposes the construction of a woman-kind\nthat is defined in its own terms, not simply by opposition to men (see\nSchor & Weed 1994). She argues, among other things, that this will\nrequire a recognition of real differences not only between men and\nwomen, but among\n women.[7] \nThis barely scratches the surface of feminist discussion of the\ndualisms that guide our thinking, both in philosophy and common sense.\nThese include mind/body, reason/emotion (Jaggar 1989; Scheman 1993;\nRooney 1993, 1994; Campbell 1998), nature/culture (Ortner 1972; Butler\n1993), freedom/necessity (Mackenzie & Stoljar 2000; Hirschmann\n2003; Holroyd 2011), agent/patient (Meyers 2004a,b). However, it does,\nhopefully, provide some introduction to the feminist issues that arise\nin thinking about classification, substances, dichotomy, and the\npotential political import of ontology and the prime importance of the\nquestion of value ladenness and attention to ideology in feminist\ntheorizing (Alcoff 2011; Haslanger 2011; Janack 2011). \nThere are a couple of over-arching questions that are worth raising\nnow with a (brief) overview in place. The outline offered here\nsuggests that in a number of different ways feminists are keen to\n“unmask” or “uncover” or\n“demythologize” certain aspects of our ordinary (and\nphilosophical) thinking. Where ordinarily we take ourselves to be\ndealing with an ontology of substances, natural things, intrinsic\nproperties, we’re in fact dealing with an ontology of social\nthings, relations, and non-substantive (and often normative) kinds.\nBut what is the relationship between these sorts of\n“unmasking” projects and projects that count as part of\n“mainstream” philosophy, or more specifically,\n“mainstream” metaphysics? So much analytic metaphysics\nconsists in “reconstructions” of our ordinary concepts; a\nsignificant amount of it is unabashedly “revisionary”. So\nalong those lines, feminist metaphysics would seem to fit right in.\nClearly feminist metaphysics differs from the mainstream in its\nsubject matter and background assumptions, in particular in its focus\non the possible value ladenness of our concepts, categories and\ntheories, and its attention to the potential harms of justificatory\nideologies. But are there more substantial differences? Is feminist\nmetaphysics just “mainstream” metaphysics directed at\ndifferent issues, or is there a deep difference? And if there is a\ndeep difference, what exactly is it? Barnes and Mikkola have recently\ncharged that certain prevalent conceptions of metaphysics in\nnon-feminist circles even rule out feminist metaphysics. The charge is\nthat prevalent conceptions of metaphysics in mainstream metaphysics\ntake metaphysics to be concerned with the basic structure of reality\nand what is “fundamental”, where it is assumed that social\nreality cannot be fundamental or basic (Barnes 2014, forthcoming;\nMikkola forthcoming). Jonathan Schaffer and Ted Sider have engaged\nwith these charges (Schaffer forthcoming; Sider forthcoming),\nattempting to show that their respective metametaphysical theories\nallow room for feminist metaphysics and metaphysics of the social more\ngenerally.","contact.mail":"asta@sfsu.edu","contact.domain":"sfsu.edu"}]
