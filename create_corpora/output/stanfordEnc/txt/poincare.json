This survey will focus on Poincaré’s\nphilosophy. Concerning Poincaré’s scientific legacy, see\nBrowder (1983) and Charpentier, Ghys, Lesne (2010).\n\n\nPoincaré’s philosophy is primarily that of a scientist\noriginating in his own daily practice of science and in the scientific\ndebates of his time. As such, it is strongly influenced by the\nreflections of Ernst Mach, James Maxwell and Hermann von Helmholtz.\nHowever, his thinking is also strongly influenced by the philosophical\ndoctrines of his time (those of Emile Boutroux, who was his\nbrother-in-law, but also of Jules Lachelier, William James, etc.), and\nis imbued with the neokantism that was very much in vogue.\nNevertheless, one must not assume that Poincaré’s\n“Kantian” vocabulary is exactly that of the German\nphilosopher, given that Poincaré often radically changes the\nmeaning of Kant’s terms.\n\n\nIn 1880, he collaborated with Émile Boutroux on the edition of\nLeibniz’ Monadology, providing an article comparing the\nphysics of Descartes and Leibniz. It was not until the 1890s, however,\nthat he became a central actor in the French philosophical scene,\nnotably through his continuous involvement in the Revue de\nmétaphysique et de morale (in which he published some\ntwenty articles) and his participation in the organization of a large\nnumber of events: the celebration of the centenary of the birth of\nDescartes, the International Congress of Philosophy of 1900, and the\ninternational edition of the works of Leibniz.\n\n\nPoincaré is best known for his critique of logicism and for his\ngeometric conventionalism. The two traditions interpreting\nPoincaré’s work thus reflect, on the one hand, a\nphilosophy of mathematics that endorses his intuitionist tendency and\nhis polemics against logicism or formalism, and, on the other hand,\nhis conventionalism both in the philosophy of science and in a broad\nlinguistic sense. In reality, these intuitionistic and formal aspects\nare two sides of the same coin, given that Poincaré always\nsupports a single position aimed at a reconstruction of the process of\nunderstanding scientific theories (see Heinzmann 2010). Neither\nformalistic nor intuitionist nor empiricist, Poincare opens a path\nlying between a realist and an anti-realist theory of mathematical\nknowledge.\n\n\nAfter providing a short biographical sketch, we will present\nPoincaré’s views organized as follows: \n\nJules Henri Poincaré was born on April 29, 1854 in Nancy in the\nLorraine region of France. His father was professor of Hygiene in the\nSchool of Medicine at the University of Nancy. His cousin Raymond was\nto become the President of the Republic of France during the period\n1913–1920 and his younger sister Aline married the philosopher\nEmile Boutroux. Henri was a precocious student who rose immediately to\nthe top of his class, excelling in both science and letters. At age\n13, his teacher told his mother that “Henri will become a\nmathematician … I would say a great mathematician”\n(Bellivier 1956: 78). During the Franco-Prussian war in 1870 the\nGermans occupied Nancy and the Poincaré family was obliged to\nbillet the secretary of the civil commissar of Nancy, with whom Henri\nwould have a round of conversation each night after dinner in order to\nimprove his German.  \nIn 1871 Poincaré passed the exams in letters with the grade\n“good” and that in science with the grade\n“fair.” He received a zero in mathematics for answering a\ndifferent question from the one that was asked, apparently having\nmisunderstood the question. He then took the preparatory classes in\nmathematics and was first in his class, also first in the academic\ncompetition and first in the national competition (concours\ngénéral) in elementary mathematics. In Paris, he entered\nthe École Polytechnique in 1873 and after graduating in 1875\n(second in his class having apparently lost points for his inability\nto draw), entered the École des Mines. After brief service as a\nmine inspector, he submitted a dissertation on partial differential\nequations and was then hired to teach the course on differential and\nintegral calculus at the University of Caen. In 1880 he submitted a\npaper solving a problem in the theory of differential equations to the\ncompetition for the grand prize in mathematics of the Academy of\nSciences in Paris. For the first time he made use of non-Euclidean\ngeometry, which was seen by most of his contemporaries as purely\nspeculative.  \nPoincaré married Louise Poulain d’Andecy on April 20,\n1881 and soon thereafter joined the faculty of sciences at the\nUniversity of Paris. In 1886 he succeeded G. Lippmann in the chair of\nmathematical physics and probability. In 1896 he was given the chair\nof mathematical astronomy and celestial mechanics, in 1902 he was\nnamed professor of theoretical electricity at the Bureau de Poste et\nTélégraph and in 1904 professor of general astronomy at\nthe École Polytechnique. Poincaré also worked at the\nFrench Bureau des Longitudes from 1893 (Galison 2003).  \nIn 1889 Poincaré won a prize from the King of Sweden for a\nquestion posed by Weierstrass on the stability of the solar system,\nthat is, the three-body (or \\(n\\)-body) problem in classical\nmechanics. Despite a mathematical error that he discovered at the last\nmoment (after questions raised by the Swedish mathematician Lars\nEdvard Phragmén) and frantically corrected, the work was\nimportant for its use of topology and as a founding document in chaos\ntheory, for Poincaré showed that in general, the stability of\nsuch systems cannot be demonstrated. It is also in this context that\nhe proved his famous recurrence theorem. \nPoincaré joined the French Academy of Sciences in 1887 and\nbecame its president in 1906. He was elected to the Académie\nFrançaise in 1908 on the basis of his three books on\nphilosophical and general problems in science. He also became a\ncorresponding member of many international scientific organizations.\nHis travel included a trip to America to give a lecture at the St.\nLouis World’s Fair in 1904. Poincaré’s extensive\ncorrespondence demonstrates the extent of his connection to the\nscientific community of his time (Nabonnand 1999; Walter 2007). He\nalso co-signed a report that played an important role in the\nrehabilitation of Dreyfus.  \nPoincaré is also famous for his 1904 conjecture concerning the\ntopology of three-dimensional spheres which remained one of the major\nunsolved problems in mathematics until the Russian mathematician\nGrigori Perelman succeeded in demonstrating it nearly one hundred\nyears later. Poincaré lectured on contemporary mathematical\nphysics for years and was very much abreast of current developments.\nPopularizer of science, pedagogue, man of letters, he became an icon\nof the popular press (see Rollet 2017, XLVI). In all he published over\nfive hundred scientific papers and over thirty books. He died July 17,\n1912 in Paris from a blood clot to the brain which was a complication\nof surgery, survived by his wife and their four children (see Rollet\n2000, Boutroux 2012, Ginoux and Gerini 2012).  \nPoincaré sets out a hierarchical view of the sciences in\nScience and Hypothesis (1902), although he does not\nexplicitly use this terminology. In his view the special sciences\npresuppose physics, which presupposes geometry, which in turn\npresupposes arithmetic. Poincaré treats topics in a serial\norder—first arithmetic, then geometry, then physics, etc. In the\nintroduction, Poincaré says that “Such is the conclusion we\nwill reach, but to get there, we must first review the sequence of\nsciences, from arithmetic and geometry to mechanics and experimental\nphysics” (Poincaré 1902, 2017, 2). The hierarchy\ninterpretation has recently come under criticism in an important pair\nof articles (Dunlop 2016 and 2017). We believe that clarifying what is\nmeant by hierarchy will resolve this debate. What is the relationship\nbetween arithmetic, geometry and the rest of the sciences? Michael\nFriedman originated the claim that Poincaré presents the\nsciences in a hierarchy, and in doing so makes clear that what he\nmeans by hierarchy is that each lower level must first be in place in\norder to be able to proceed to the next level: \nBut the point perhaps can be made even more clearly if we consider\nNewton’s theory of universal gravitation. For Newton’s\nPrincipia had already shown clearly how we can empirically\ndiscover the law of universal gravitation—on the presupposition,\nthat is, of the Newtonian laws of motion and Euclidean geometry.\nWithout these presuppositions, however, we certainly would not have\nbeen able to discover the law of gravitation. And the same example\nalso shows clearly how each level in the hierarchy of sciences\npresupposes all of the preceding levels: we would have no laws of\nmotion if we did not presuppose spatial geometry, no geometry if we\ndid not presuppose the theory of mathematical magnitude, and of course\nno mathematics at all if we did not presuppose arithmetic (Friedman\n1999, 76). \nNote that Friedman mentions the theory of mathematical magnitude as\nwell. There is a step between arithmetic and geometry, namely the\ntheory of mathematical magnitude, which is precisely the topic of\nChapter 2 of Science and Hypothesis. The theory of\nmathematical magnitude presupposes the possibility of indefinite\nrepetition, and therefore something like mathematical induction, which\nPoincaré presents as central to arithmetic in Chapter 1 of\nScience and Hypothesis. \nThere is direct evidence that Poincaré thought that mathematics\nmust be in place before we can do any empirical science. For example,\nin the opening of Chapter 12 of Science and Hypothesis, he\nremarks that: “The purpose of mathematical theories is not to reveal\nthe true nature of things. Such a claim would be unreasonable. Their\nonly goal is to coordinate the physical laws that experiment reveals\nto us, but that we could not even state without the help of\nmathematics” (Poincaré 1902, 2017, 143). Dunlop, by contrast,\nseems to have something much stronger in mind with the idea of the\nhierarchy, which is perhaps why she calls the thesis the dependency\nhierarchy interpretation. She seems to take the interpretation to be a\nthesis of reductionism, that geometry reduces to arithmetic, or at\nleast, the intuitive reasoning used in arithmetic is all that we need\nin geometry. \nCommentators have suggested that the intuition that grounds the use of\ninduction in arithmetic also underlies the conception of a continuum,\nthat the consistency of geometrical axioms must be proved through\narithmetical induction, and that arithmetical induction licenses the\nsupposition that certain operations form a group (Dunlop 2016,\n274). \nDunlop is absolutely correct in saying that this is not\nPoincaré’s view. Rather, he says that we need arithmetic and\nfurther things in order to work in geometry. All that we take\nPoincaré to be saying is that we still need to add, subtract,\nmultiply, and divide when we are doing geometry, but we will be doing\nmore than what we do in arithmetic. The reason that we need a theory\nof magnitude before we can do geometry is because we measure things.\nThe reason we need geometry in classical mechanics is because we are\ndoing things like tracking the elliptical orbits of the planets. Thus,\nwe also agree with Dunlop when she says that “Poincaré’s\nviews of arithmetic and geometry cannot be reconciled by supposing\ngeometry to be founded on arithmetical operations or principles”\n(Dunlop 2016, 306). We need arithmetic, plus group theory, plus the\nconventions in order to have metric geometry. There may be some\nauthors who made reductionist claims, but it is not what we take from\nFriedman’s original presentation. Furthermore, the reductionist\ninterpretation cannot be right when we get to the physical sciences,\nwhere there is clearly more content in the higher-level\nsciences—empirical content that could not\npossibly be reduced to mathematics. \nPoincaré discusses the sciences in a sequence, starting with\narithmetic. Mathematical induction is essential in arithmetic, because\nonly by using it can we make assertions about all numbers.\nPoincaré considers mathematical induction to be a genuine\nsynthetic a priori. He next considers magnitude, which requires\narithmetic, but goes further. Likewise, geometry extends our knowledge\nstill further, but requires the theory of magnitude to make\nmeasurements, and arithmetic to combine numbers. Poincaré then\nconsiders classical mechanics, which again extends our knowledge while\nrelying on the mathematics that came before it. Finally, he considers\ntheories of physics, where we have genuine empirical results, but\nbased on the mathematics, hypotheses and conventions that came before.\nThus the sciences are laid out like expanding concentric circles, with\nnew content being added to the base at each level. The lower levels\nare necessary preconditions for higher levels, but they are not\nsufficient.  \nPoincaré makes hypotheses central to his analysis of science,\ndistinguishing four kinds, which are actually given in two lists of\nthree each (Poincaré 1902: 24 and 166–167; 2017: 1 and\n109-110). Combining the two lists, these are:  \nBy verifiable hypotheses, Poincaré means general statements\nthat have been confirmed by experiment. These are the backbone of\nnatural science and can be seen non-controversially to be compatible\nwith standard accounts of, say, the Hypothetical-Deductive method.\nHowever, it is important for Poincaré that this is not all of\nscience, as he is arguing for a view of science that is between\nempiricism and rationalism.  \nIndifferent hypotheses are ontological in nature and are, for example,\nmechanical models of underlying mechanism. As Poincaré\nemphasizes, these can frequently be exchanged without sacrificing\nempirical accuracy. Take, for example, the propagation of heat, where\n“through the effects of the averages and thanks to the\nmedium’s symmetry, all the differences even out” and we need\nnot inquire how each molecule radiates. Such hypotheses are mere tools\nuseful for thought but “unverifiable” and\n“useless” as such (Poincaré 1902: 169; 2017:\n111). \nNatural hypotheses are necessary conditions for science but are\nexperimentally inaccessible:  \nIt is difficult not to suppose that the influence of very distant\nbodies is altogether negligible, that small motions obey a linear law,\nthat the effect is a continuous function of its cause. I would say the\nsame of the conditions imposed by symmetry. All these hypotheses form,\nso to speak, the foundation common to all the theories of mathematical\nphysics.” Poincaré 1902: 166; 2017: 109)  \nFinally, apparent hypotheses are definitions or conventions rather\nthan actual claims about the world. They therefore may not be\nconsidered to be hypotheses at all, although they are, however, often\nmistaken for hypotheses. Poincaré argues that (metric) geometry\nis the hypothesis most prone to such confusion. Although he presents\narithmetic in Science and Hypothesis without mentioning\nhypotheses explicitly, we can see a role for them in his analysis here\nas well, which we will present in the order that he follows.  \nCentral to Poincaré’s analysis of arithmetic is the\nprinciple of recurrence, or mathematical induction, which he\nconsidered to be a synthetic a priori principle that\n“would then seem so self-evident that we would not be able to\nconceive of the opposite proposition” (Poincaré 1902: 74;\n2017: 42). The principle of mathematical induction is necessary to\nprove general statements about numbers and is thus a necessary tool in\nmathematics. Therefore the principle of mathematical induction is\nsimilar to a natural hypothesis or at least plays a similar role to\nthat of a natural hypothesis. Of course, there are important\ndifferences between mathematical induction and the principle of\ninduction used in the natural sciences. The principle of mathematical\ninduction gives certainty, while the inductive generalizations in the\nnatural sciences give only probability (1902: 27; 2017: 3). The\nprinciple of mathematical induction is based on “the affirmation\nof the power of a mind that knows itself capable of conceiving the\nindefinite repetition of a particular action as soon as this action is\npossible” (1902: 41–42; 2017: 15), so that there can be no\nuncertainty. It can be argued that Poincaré is justified in\nincluding his analysis of arithmetic in Science and\nHypothesis, that is, in his analysis of empirical science, given\nthat there is a striking similarity between the role played by the\nprinciple of mathematical induction and the principle of induction in\nnatural science, which “is as difficult to justify […] as\nit is to get along without it” (1905b: 176; 1913b: 345).  \nPoincaré argues that (metric) geometry is neither a\npriori nor empirical, but rather conventional. It is important to\nnote, however, that these conventions are guided by experience\naccording to Poincaré, rather than being totally arbitrary, as\nsome later writers take conventions to be. This connotation of the\nword ‘convention’ has led to many misrepresentations of\nPoincaré’s views. The existence of consistent alternative\ngeometries shows that the geometry of space cannot be determined a\npriori. The fact that we experience material bodies and their\nrelations, rather than space, leads Poincaré to argue that the\ngeometry of space cannot be determined empirically either. Thus,\nstatements about the geometry of space are apparent hypotheses or\nconventions that appear to be making descriptive claims, however they\nare actually closer to definitions, though they cannot be reduced to\nbeing merely linguistic.  \nPoincaré conceives of our perception of objects as a\ncombination of motor and visual impressions that are at first\nnon-spatial. In order to classify these sensations, which only appear\nbecause of the movement of our bodies, Poincaré says we\nintroduce “sensible space” as a category “of our\nunderstanding” that is not physical space and does not even have\na metric, meaning that “it involves no idea of\nmeasurement” (Poincaré 1898). Sensible space is a\nnecessary condition for our understanding of our place in the world,\nthat is, for our understanding of the objects around us, their\nrelations and how they move, but it is not a form of our sensibility,\nsince individual sensations can exist without it (Poincaré\n1898: 3). Thus sensible space can be seen as an example of a natural\nhypothesis. We introduce a metric to this space in order to measure\ndistance by using the language of group theory, that is, the\nmathematical study of abstract algebraic structures. Groups serve as a\ntool of reasoning about representations of muscular sensations. We can\nchoose a group (or sub-group) which corresponds to the geometry of\nEuclid, Lobachevskii or Riemann to describe space. Poincaré\nproposes a criterion of choice between the three possible geometries,\npositing  \nthe existence of an invariant sub-group, of which all the\ndisplacements are interchangeable and which is formed of all\ntranslations. (1898: 21)  \nOnly Euclidean geometry meets this criterion, so the conventional\nchoice of Euclidean geometry is determined by the simplicity of\ninterchangeability that “translated into analytical language\n[…] means that there are fewer terms in the equations”\n(Poincaré 1898: 43). The empirical underdetermination of the\ngroups has a purely contrastive (arbitrary) character if the groups\nare isolated from the background beliefs furnished by our mind\n(Stanford 2009). “Holistic” considerations (commodity,\nsimplicity) overcome the empirical equivalence between different\ngeometries and give more evidence for Euclidean geometry. In contrast\nto geometry, no choices between alternatives are given in arithmetic.\n \nWe have thus far discussed arithmetic and geometry and examined a\npriori principles, natural hypotheses, and apparent hypotheses.\nIn discussion of natural science Poincaré presents his views on\nverifiable hypotheses, which are characterized by mechanical laws that\nare arrived at through experiment:  \nWhat then is a good experiment? It is one that informs us of something\nbesides an isolated fact, one that allows us to make predictions; that\nis, that allows us to generalize. For without generalization, we\ncannot make predictions. (Poincaré 1902: 158; 2017: 104)  \nThe hypotheses that arise from experiment are verifiable hypotheses.\nThe process of generalization presupposes a belief in the unity and\nsimplicity of nature (see 1902: 161 ff.; 2017: 105 ff.), although it\nis important to remember that for Poincaré experience is always\na complex phenomenon that is theory laden. Any good experiment in\nphysics can be generalized in an infinite number of ways, depending on\nour preconceived ideas, and every generalization results in a\nhypothesis. While he emphasizes the creative role of the scientist,\nPoincaré does not go so far as to say that natural laws are\nsimple definitions, as Le Roy proposed (1901: 143). \nNot all laws are directly accessible to experiment. Generalization in\nphysical science has to take the mathematical form of a differential\nequation in order to grasp complexity and to unify science:  \nIt is not sufficient for each elementary phenomenon to obey simple\nlaws, all those to be combined must obey the same law as well.\n(Poincaré 1902: 171; 2017: 113).  \nThe law of inertia, for example, obtains only with respect to the\npre-existing category of differential equations. These differential\nequations are, in the final analysis, the physical laws:  \nNewton has shown that a law is only a necessary relation between the\npresent state of the world and its immediately subsequent state. All\nthe laws discovered since are nothing else; they are in sum,\ndifferential equations. (Poincaré 1905b: 119; 1913b: 292) \nIn geometry, Poincaré supposes the pre-existent category of a\ngroup. In mechanics, the categorical tools are the principle of\n(empirical) induction and differential equations. So,\nPoincaré’s position represents a hierarchy of elements\nthat, as in Kant, are presupposed as necessary conditions of the\npossibility of the science on the next level. The scheme of\ngeneralization in mechanics appears as follows: Experience provides\ncomplex phenomena, i.e., “a confused mass of facts” which\nwe reduce into a number of elementary phenomena by means of\nexperiment. From these elementary phenomena, we generalize (e.g., via\nthe empirical induction principle) to elementary facts and move, by\nmeans of differential equations, to laws and verifiable hypotheses\nwhose number should be kept as small as possible (Poincaré\n1902: 168–171; 2017: 110–113). Finally, laws can be\nelevated by decree to the status of principles, thus allowing the\nbasic principles of mechanics to become conventions; not arbitrary\nconventions however, since “They would be arbitrary [only] if we\nwere to lose sight of the experiments that led the founders of\nmechanics to adopt the laws and which, as imperfect as these\nexperiments may be, suffice to justify them” (1902: 128; 2017:\n82). For Poincaré the principles of mechanics\n(principle of inertia, law of acceleration, principle of relative\nmotion, etc.) are not hypotheses but rather conventions\n(Poincaré 1902: 151; 2017: 99), although they are of course of\nexperimental origin. These conventions do not constitute a choice\nbetween physical alternatives, but rather must be interpreted as\ndefining the basic terms of a theory. Immune to experimental\ndisconfirmation without being a priori in the classical\nsense, they are necessary preconditions to the sciences further up in\nthe hierarchy (Poincaré 1902: chap. VI and VII).  \nIn the physical sciences proper, such as optics and electrodynamics,\nthe scene changes entirely and principles seem no longer to share the\nconventional character of the geometrical postulates.\nPoincaré’s “indifferent hypotheses” are those\nthat the analyst assumes at the beginning of calculations and that are\nneither true nor false, but rather play roles as positions in a\nstructure. Indifferent hypotheses differ from geometrical conventions\nin one very important sense. While geometry rests on a conventional\ndecree, the structures of physics (mechanics included) do not\nsystematically rest on indifferent hypotheses; rather, these\nhypotheses have only a psychological and pedagogic function as mental\nconstructs that are in a sense superfluous, since they can change\nwhile leaving the experimental results intact. The basis of\nPoincaré’s structural realism can be seen in his idea\nthat the content is superfluous and that it is the relations expressed\nin natural laws that remain through time that are essential to\nscience.  \nHere then is the methodological analogy and link between the principle\nof induction, conventions in the sense of apparent hypotheses and\nverifiable hypotheses. All are guided by experience without being\n(entirely) experimental, and all involve presupposed categories or\nnatural hypotheses. Verifiable hypotheses employ conventional elements\nin the generalization process and may presuppose the (empirical)\nprinciple of induction. Geometrical conventions are apparent\nhypotheses guided by the experience of muscular sensations and involve\nthe category of groups. Both these sorts of hypotheses, verifiable and\napparent, employed in physics and geometry, are in\nPoincaré’s hierarchy of sciences framed on the one hand\nby a priori principles and natural hypotheses that are tools\nboth for mathematicians and experimenters, and on the other hand, by\nindifferent hypotheses and physical principles. The indifferent\nhypotheses are conventional (in the ordinary sense) stipulations of\nontological entities—mechanical models that increase our\ntheoretical insight, while the physical principles are either\nverifiable hypotheses elevated by decree beyond the crucible of\nexperiment or well-founded with respect to the network of actual\nscience.  \nConcerning logic and foundations of mathematics,\nPoincaré’s position is governed by two theses: \nHistorically, both theses are directed broadly against the founders of\nmodern logic and set theory such as Cantor, Peano, Frege, Russell,\nZermelo, and Hilbert. On closer inspection, the historical situation\nis more complicated. With respect to Georg Cantor, for example, we\nmust distinguish his work as a logical-set theoretical method useful\nin treating mathematical problems especially in the theory of\nfunctions on the one hand, and on the other hand, set theory as a tool\nfor foundations or for considerations on infinite cardinality. Through\nGösta Mittag-Leffler, Poincaré was familiar with\nCantor’s work of the first type and uses it in his theory of\nFuchsian functions in 1882 (Poincaré 1882: 1167), even having\npersonal contact with Cantor (see Gray 1991: 22; Cantor 1991: 188; and\nDécaillot 2008: 281). However, Poincaré rejected the\nlater foundational work of Cantor, saying that  \nThere is no actual infinity, the Cantorians have forgotten that, and\nthey have fallen into contradiction. It is true that Cantorism\nrendered services, but that was when it was applied to a real problem\nwhose terms were clearly defined, and we could walk safely.\nLogisticians as Cantorians have forgotten. (Poincaré 1908:\n212–213; 1913b: 484)  \nWhile it has been stressed by all commentators that\nPoincaré’s concerns with the foundations of mathematics\nare very different from those of the logicians, there is no unanimity\non the focus of the dispute. Emile Boutroux and Warren Goldfarb claim\nthat Poincaré is condemning the “logical” point of\nview for not providing psychological conviction (Boutroux 1914;\nGoldfarb 1985), while Detlefsen and Heinzmann argue for a difference\nat the epistemological level rather than a psychological one\n(Detlefsen 1992, 1993; Heinzmann 1995). In a famous response to\nRussell, Poincaré refuses to consider logic or epistemology\nindependently from psychology (Poincaré 1909: 482). It would be\nfalse, however, to believe that he thus conflates logic and\npsychology. Indeed, Poincaré does not use the term psychology\nin the modern sense, but rather in all situations where he wants to\nemphasize the dimension of understanding, in particular its historical\nelements, which he contrasts with the mere correct logical exposition\nof the result. It is therefore not surprising that, according to\nPoincaré, mathematics requires intuition, interpreted as an\nelement of understanding, not only in the context of discovery, but\nequally in the context of justification. As we have already seen, in\narithmetic pure intuition is necessary to justify the complete (or\nmathematical) induction principle. It should also be noted that the\nterm “intuition” is quite ambiguous, a fact that is well\nknown and explicitly discussed by Poincaré himself. In The\nValue of Science, he distinguished three kinds of intuition: an\nappeal to sense and to imagination, generalization by induction, and\nintuition of pure number—whence comes the axiom of induction in\nmathematics. The first two kinds cannot give us certainty, but, he\nsays, “who would seriously doubt the third, who would doubt\narithmetic?” (Poincaré 1905b: 33; 1913b: 216). \nFrom 1905, Poincaré therefore opposed the logicist thesis that\nclaims to be able to prove all mathematical truths without recourse to\nintuition, once the principles of logic are admitted. Poincaré\nsuspected that the logicians were actually making an equivocal use of\nthe term logic and that they no longer sought the former kind, but\nrather a “new logic” containing principles of synthetic\nproof or formations of non-logical concept. He was evidently right\ngiven that not only is the modern logic of predicates richer than the\ntraditional (syllogistic) logic, but in order to carry out the\nlogicist project, one is even led to expand logic again by certain\nset-theoretic postulates of existence. \nAs Detlefsen points out, Poincaré’s most interesting\nargument does not concern the status of the basic laws of the logical\nsystems, but rather the “place of logical inference in\nmathematical proof” (Detlefsen 1992: 349). According to\nPoincaré, today’s admitted validity of a logical, i.e.,\ntopic-neutral, inference from a proposition \\(p\\) to a\nproposition \\(q\\) (in Tarski’s conception: every model of\n\\(p\\) is a model of \\(q)\\) is not enough to sustain\nepistemic growth of mathematical knowledge, which requires\nrather that “\\(p\\) be seen mathematically to imply\n\\(q\\) (i.e., that \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) be seen as united by\na common mathematical structure)” (Detlefsen 1993:\n272). Poincaré insists on the non-invariance of mathematical\nreasoning with respect to its content and advances, so to speak, a\nlocal conception of reasoning (for example, the mathematical induction\nprinciple for arithmetical reasoning). According to this view, a gap\nin a proof is no longer a logical gap, but a gap in the mathematical\nunderstanding (Detlefsen 1992: 360, 366). If\n“formalization” and a universal calculus are, then, no\nlonger the criterion of mathematical rigor, how shall rigor be\nmaintained? Poincaré’s response mentions in particular\nthe condensing of the content of the premises to the content of the\nconclusion by means of intuition. Rigor is obtained by combining Ernst\nMach’s principle of the economy of thought with the concept of\nharmony, that is, thanks to “the fortunate inventions of\nlanguage” that introduce an order-structure, the complexity of a\ndomain of objects is made more harmonious by the introduction of an\ninvariance (see Poincaré 1908: 23–30; 1913b:\n371–375). Thus, in mathematical reasoning, rigor is placed in\nthe context of a “mathematical architecture” whose\nsimplest expression is found in mathematical induction. \nRegarding the antinomies discovered at the turn of the century—\nsuch as Richard’s or Russell’s paradoxes—they are,\naccording to Poincaré, the consequence of an abusive use of\nintuition with respect to abstract entities that arises from the\nadoption of conceptual realism (Platonism). In a definition of the\nform \\(\\exists y \\forall x ((x \\in y) \\leftrightarrow D[x])\\), the\nexistence of the set \\(y\\) is intuitively postulated without any\nrestriction for the predicate \\(D[x]\\). For an anti-Platonist like\nPoincaré was from 1906 on, intuition is not a mode for\nrepresenting an object, but rather concerns our capacity to follow a\nrule. We see this quite clearly in Poincaré’s discussion\nof mathematical induction.  \nWe know that Poincaré hoped to avoid the known antinomies by\nlimiting himself to predicative definitions (see Heinzmann 1985). It\nwas Russell who introduced the terms “predicative” and\n“non-predicative” to highlight the difference between two\nkinds of propositional functions, those that determine and those that\ndo not determine a class. He called the first\n“predicative” and the second\n“non-predicative.” Poincaré attributed the mistake\nof non-predicative definitions to a vicious circle: a definition is\n“non-predicative” if the definiens contains or\nrelates to a totality of which the definiendum is a part. He\nformulated a principle to avoid circularity, which leads directly to\nRussell’s famous vicious circle principle:  \nI recognize further this element of truth in Poincaré’s\nobjection to totality, that whatever in any way concerns all\nof any or some (undetermined) of the members of a\nclass must not be itself one of the members of a class. (Russell 1973\n[1906]: 198)  \nRussell succeeded in developing a theory that respects his principle,\nthe ramified type theory. In Poincaré, we find nothing that is\ncomparable, for he believed that the principle guarded against the\ndefinitional mistakes that he denounced. He did not seriously take up\nthe question and only formulated successively different variants of\nthe principle when he learned from Ernst Zermelo that the proof,\nproposed by Argand and Cauchy, of the fundamental theorem of algebra\nmakes an appeal precisely to the rejected, non-predicative\ndefinitions. Hence, only when the measures taken against the logical\nantinomies affected “real mathematics” did he try to\nmodify the principle. The discussion between Poincaré, Russell,\nPeano, and Zermelo on the measures to take lasted for six years. The\ndifficulty consisted in the obligation to formulate a principle that\nis neither too restrictive for the important results in analysis, nor\ntoo liberal with respect to the formations of concept to be excluded\nby reason of Poincaré’s philosophical position. The\nabsence of a truly convincing solution shows that the analysis of the\nconcept of predicativity with the help of informal methods appeared to\nhave reached its limits. \nIn 1912, the year of Poincaré’s death, Luitzen Egbertus\nJan Brouwer in his inaugural lecture at Amsterdam characterized two\nopposing orientations in mathematics: intuitionism (in large part\nFrench) and formalism (in large part German). The two orientations\nwere represented by the greatest mathematicians of the antagonistic\nFranco-German pairing: Henri Poincaré and David Hilbert\n(Brouwer 1912: 124–125). According to the historians, the\nmodernists are thos eat the beginning of the 20th century who\nsupported an algebraization of the contents up to and including the\nlanguage of signs, while the conservative tendency finds the\njustification of mathematical knowledge before language, that is, in\nthe intellect. The polemics of the period persist today, even though\nits political metaphor (conservatism/modernism) has been reversed.\nSince the death of Bourbaki, it is fashionable to emphasize the\nintuitive aspects of mathematics. Yet, it is remarkable that Brouwer\nhimself criticizes Poincaré’s conflation of “the\nlanguage of mathematics [and] the true mathematical\nconstruction” (Brouwer 1907: 176). Brouwer is quite right to\nemphasize that Poincaré does not separate language and\nmathematics. Poincaré ascribes to language—but not to\nlogic—an essential role in mathematical reasoning. In this\nsense, we may say that Poincaré is, with respect to Brouwer, a\nsemi-intuitionist who is located squarely between the two fronts of\nthe dispute. For him, mathematical reasoning possesses and must\nconserve an intuitive content that defies the formal contents. In\nsummary, the similarities and differences between Poincaré and\nBrouwer can be shown as follows: \nPoincaré was strongly influenced by and attuned to the French\nphilosophical scene, which refers to the Kantian tradition to show the\nlimits of methodological positivism. Members of the so-called\nCritique de la science movement (Benrubi 1928), which\nincludes members of the “Boutroux Circle” (Nye 1979)\nadvocate a mixture of positivism and Neo-Kantianism. They criticize\nboth Comte’s determinism and Kant’s static view of the\nmind’s structure. According to Poincaré, mathematics\nrequires intuition not only in the context of discovery but also in\nthe context of justification, especially in arithmetic and logic. So\nit is not surprising that Poincaré was discussed in German\nphilosophical circles in the Kantian tradition, for example by Ernst\nCassirer (1910), Ilse Rosenthal-Schneider (1914), who is a disciple of\nAlois Rhiel, and Moritz Schlick (1918). Thus, Poincaré was\ntaken to be one of the Neo-Kantian precursors of logical positivism.\nHowever, unlike Kant, the arithmetical “pure intuition”\nPoincaré introduces is intellectual in character and\nPoincaré does not in the least solve the problem of the unity\nof spontaneity and receptivity by the introduction of a pure\nsensibility. Rather, he changes the terms of the Kantian contrast,\nemphasizing the balance between exactness, that which is common to\nmany minds and is transmissible by discourse, and subjective\nacquaintance, which is intransmissible sensation. He expresses this\ndifficult balance in a formula well known due to its popularization by\nEinstein:  \nwhat they [mathematics] have gained in rigor, they have lost in\nobjectivity. It is by distancing themselves from reality that they\nacquired this perfect purity. (Poincaré 1908: 131; 1913b:\n435) \nBecause of his concern for the application of mathematics,\nPoincaré did not confine himself to the perfect purity of\nmathematics. \nThe existence of relatively consistent non-Euclidean geometries leads\nhim to the view that geometric propositions cannot be determined by\na priori intuitions and that it is necessary to study\n“the structural relations between Euclidean and non-Euclidean\ngeometry” (Nye 1979: 111). Poincaré established a famous\ndictionary translating concepts and propositions of\nLobachevskii’s geometry into Euclidean geometry in order to\ncreate a model to show the relative consistency of\nLobachevskii’s geometry (Poincaré 1891: 771; cf. 1902:\n68; 2017: 37). Concerning pure and applied geometry,\nPoincaré holds the modernist-sounding views that we have no\npre-axiomatic understanding of geometric primitives, that rigor\ndemands that we eliminate appeals to intuition in geometry, and that\n(metric) geometry is neither true nor false, not only because we\ncannot verify which one is true, but also because we cannot\nempirically determine the metric geometry of space ‘in\nprinciple.’ When we speak of space, all we can talk about is the\nrelations of physical bodies:  \n[B]ecause of the relativity and passivity of space, they will not\ndepend on the absolute position and orientation of the system. In\nother words, the state of the bodies and their mutual distances at a\ngiven instant will depend only on the state of these same bodies and\ntheir mutual distances at the initial instant, but will in no way\ndepend on the initial absolute position and initial absolute\norientation of the system. For brevity’s sake, this is what I might\ncall the law of relativity. […] [S]uch a statement is\nindependent of any interpretation of the experiments. If the law is\ntrue in the Euclidean interpretation, it will also be true in the\nnon-Euclidean interpretation (Poincaré 1902: 98–99; 2017:\n61–62).  \nIn rejecting physical space, Poincaré held a relationalist view\nof space that goes further than current space-time theories allow\n(Stump 1989; Walter 2010).  \nSince Poincaré so profoundly modifies the traditional view of\ngeometry as the a priori science of space, authors such as\nSchlick, Carnap, and Ernest Nagel (1939, 1979) attribute to him a\nleading role in the development of the formal conception of\nmathematics. Alberto Coffa extends Nagel’s analysis by claiming\nthat there was a crisis in the interpretation of primitive geometrical\nterms in the nineteenth century that led to the development of formal\naxiomatic systems (Coffa 1986). References to a central role played by\nPoincaré can also be found in Joan Richards’ survey\n(Richards 1994) and in Jeremy Gray’s account of the development\nof modernism (Gray 2008). The modernist character of\nPoincaré’s approach is also shown by the fact that he\nmust be ranked with Duhem among those forerunners of logical\nempiricism who survive Quine’s criticism of the movement, not\nprimarily for his holistic thesis concerning theory-confirmation, more\nso for his conception of geometrical conventions as a kind of hybrid\nanalytic-synthetic expressions “guided” by experience and\nfor his ontological “relationalism” which in certain\naspects comes close to Quine’s doctrine. Both attempt to account\nphilosophically for the incompleteness of (scientific) objects. \nPoincaré argues that  \ncontrary to the naive dogmatists’ view, that which science captures\nare not the things themselves, but simply relationships between them.\nBeyond these relations, there is no knowable reality (1902: 25; 2017:\n2). \nThus, he rejects metaphysical realism:  \nNo, beyond doubt a reality completely independent of the mind which\nconceives it, sees or feels it, is an impossibility. A world as\nexterior as that, even if it existed, would for us be forever\ninaccessible(Poincaré 1905b: 23; 1913b: 209)  \nAlthough Quine’s argument (“no entity without\nidentity”) finds a different motivation in a logical context\nquite distant from that of Poincaré’s, the result is\nsimilar. For Quine, mathematical objects are “known only by\ntheir laws” and any other properties that they may have are\nirrelevant (Quine 1969: 44). \nPoincaré’s geometrical conventions and his ontological\nrelationalism are nothing more than two different aspects of his\nstructural approach, as can be seen by considering two parallel\ndebates at the turn of the 20th century on the nature of\ngeometry—one between Henri Poincaré and Bertrand Russell\nand the other between David Hilbert and Gottlob Frege. Poincaré\nand Hilbert argue for a new conception of geometrical systems, while\nFrege and Russell defend a traditional way of looking at these\nsystems. The debate takes up the questions: Which geometry is true?\nWhat is the nature of definitions and axioms? To deal with the\nmultiplicity of geometries, questions about their truth, and the\nmeaning of their primitive terms, Poincaré and Hilbert propose\na radically new view of geometry. They hold that all that we can say\nabout the meaning of ‘point’, ‘straight line’,\n‘distance’, etc. is that which we have stated in the\naxioms or principles of the system, and that geometry is not a set of\ntruths about some previously known objects. Thus Poincaré\nformulates a new view of geometric theories, that geometry does not\nexpress true or false propositions and that there are no special\nobjects which geometry studies. Rather, geometry is just a system of\nrelations that can be applied to many kinds of objects. \nPoincaré argues against Russell’s view of definition,\nclaiming that the meaning of primitive terms can be fixed by the\ngeometrical system in which we are working. Fixing the meaning of\nprimitive terms by the system is the only way to proceed,\nPoincaré argues, because, if we were to take a primitive term\nout of the context of a system, it would lose all meaning:  \nIf one wants to isolate a term and exclude its relations with other\nterms, nothing will remain. This term will not only become\nindefinable, it will become devoid of meaning.\n(Poincaré 1900: 78, Poincaré’s emphasis)  \nAs Poincaré explains in a section entitled “Form and\nMatter” of his Monist article of 1898, the idea is that in\ngeometry the properties of the primitives or of the objects to which\ngeometrical relations are applied are not important at all, as far as\ngeometry is concerned. The set of relations that hold between the\nprimitives constitute the form, not the matter, of geometric objects,\nand these relations are what are studied. The form constitutes the\nrelational aspect of Poincaré’s structuralism. \nBy recognizing Poincaré’s heritage as a structural point\nof view, Schlick insists on the conventional aspect of his\nstructuralism. He sees in Poincaré’s conventions a third\ntype of definition between the implicit definitions of the axiomatic\nmethod and the concrete or ostensive definitions of physical objects.\nThese conventions are, as Friedman observes “crucial for an\nunderstanding of how we achieve a coordination between concepts and\nempirical reality in the mathematical exact sciences” (2007:\n100). As Schlick explains: \nTo define a concept implicitly is to determine it by means of its\nrelations to other concepts. But to apply such a concept to reality is\nto choose, out of the infinite wealth of relations in the world, a\ncertain group or complex and to embrace as a unit by designating it\nwith a name. By suitable choice it is always possible under certain\ncircumstances to obtain an unambiguous designation of the real by\nmeans of the concept. Conceptual definitions and coordinations that\ncome into being in this fashion we call conventions (using this term\nin the narrower sense, because in the broader sense, of course, all\ndefinitions are agreements). It was Henri Poincaré who\nintroduced the term convention in this narrower sense into natural\nphilosophy; and one of the most important tasks of that discipline is\nto investigate the nature and meaning of the various conventions found\nin natural science (Schlick 1925, 91–92). \nAccording to Schlick, Poincaré’s conventions combine\nconceptual definitions and coordinations. Given the fact that both\nexpressions are completely foreign to Poincaré’s style,\nhow should one understand Schlick’s claim? In fact,\nSchlick’s expressions designate two different aspects of\nPoincaré’s structural approach, which pay attention to\nthe fact that Poincaré is not an ante rem\nstructuralist (the ante rem structuralist takes the pattern\nto exist independently of any systems that exemplify it). At first\nglance he seems to be an ontological realist with respect to\nrelational universals (but not with respect to individuals\n(relata)), despite his predicativist attitude. As Elie Zahar\nemphasizes, such a position is not naturally compatible with classical\nsemantics (logic) because this latter “seems unable to interpret\nrelations except through their relata”: one cannot\nconfirm \\(R(a,b)\\) without determining  \nthe referents of both, ‘\\(a\\)’ and\n‘\\(b\\)’ in order then to ascertain whether\n\\(\\lt a,b\\gt\\) belongs to the referent of\n‘\\(R\\)’. (Zahar 2001: 38) \nAn answer to this difficulty can be found by examining four steps of\nPoincaré’s psycho-physiological reconstruction of the\ngenesis of geometry. In his early articles, Poincaré argues\nthat geometry concerns only the relations expressed in the axioms, not\nsome inherent features of the primitives:  \nWhat we call geometry is nothing but the study of formal properties of\na certain continuous group; so we may say, space is a group.\n(Poincaré 1898: 41)  \nThe first step of Poincaré’s construction of geometrical\nspace via groups proceeds from the observable fact that a set of\nimpressions can be modified in two distinct ways: on the one hand\nwithout our feeling muscular sensations, and on the other, by a\nvoluntary motor action accompanied by muscular sensations. So, as in\nCarnap’s Aufbau, the starting point here is the\ndefinition (guided by experience) of two two-place relations: an\nexternal change \\(a\\) (with ‘\\(x a y\\)’ for ‘\\(x\\)\nchanges in \\(y\\) without muscular sensation’) and an internal\nchange \\(S\\) (with ‘\\(x S y\\)’ for ‘\\(x\\) changes in\n\\(y\\) accompanied by muscular sensations’). In the second step,\nhe introduces a classification of external changes, some of which can\nbe brought back to the starting point by an internal change (changes\nof position), while others (changes of state) cannot. One presupposes\nby convention that the internal compensation for external changes is\nexact and not approximate. In the third step, Poincaré defines\nthe equivalence class of changes of position through an identity\ncondition with respect to the compensation by internal changes and\ncalls it a displacement: \nThe fourth step and Poincaré’s main result is that each\nset of displacement classes (external & internal) forms a group in\nthe mathematical sense. The general concept of a group is a form of\nour understanding that “pre-exists in our mind” (1902:107;\n2017: 56 and 68; 1898: 42–43) or an ante rem structure,\nwhich the specific displacement-structure \\((=\\) transformation group)\nexemplifies. Thus, the genesis of geometry is based on an\nepistemological process founded on previous classifications, carried\nout as a relationship between a structure as norm of invariance and\nconventionally adapted systems as instantiations or exemplifications\nof these norms. \nWhere there is a choice between different possibilities, conventions\nonly become involved at a further step of the mathematical\nconstruction where the properties of the transformation group are\nstudied and choices are made concerning distance (a metric). It\nfollows that the Euclidean axiom of distance is not\nexclusively the result of a conventional choice in the\nlinguistic sense, rather, it is a “disguised definition”\nor an “apparent hypothesis.” Poincaré uses the term\n“disguised definition” before 1899, the year of\nHilbert’s famous Foundations of Geometry, to express\nthe fact that language apparently used descriptively is not\ndescriptive in actuality. Certain axioms appear descriptive, but\ninstead define the objectivity of a fact (Poincaré 1899: 274).\nSuch a fact is found to be defined only up to structure, although it\nclearly reflects the truth of certain relations between sensations\nwhose qualities remain unknowable, as shown by Helmholtz and others\n(Poincaré 1905b: 174. \nPoincaré’s often quoted structuralist Credo that\nin mathematics the word “exist” means “that its\ndefintion does not imply a contradiction” (1902: 70; 2017:\n38–39; 1905c: 819), must be seen in a non-Hilbertian light.\nPoincaré’s geometric propositions (conventions), which\nare neither true nor false, are not propositional schemata that can be\nsatisfied by a model. For reasons concerning in particular the\ninvolvement of a vicious circle with respect to the principle of\ncomplete induction, Poincaré rejects the idea of ensuring\nmathematical reliability with a Hilbert-style consistency proof\n(Poincaré 1906: 301; cf. Detlefsen 1986: 59 ff. for a critical\nassessment). Even with respect to geometry, he takes a structural\nposition without, however, disengaging meaning and knowledge\ncompletely from ostension. Nevertheless, Poincaré begins his\nalternative reliability construction only apparently with\nsensations as ostensive contacts with the given, since he is not an\nempiricist. Instead, in a move similar to Helmholtz’s conception\nof intuition as imagined sensible impressions, Poincaré\nintroduces a representation of a two-place sensation relation, based\non the imagination of single sensations. The representation\nof an object in sensible space means nothing other than the\ndeliberate and conscious representation of muscular sensations\nthought necessary to reach the object (Poincaré 1902:\n82; 2017: 48–49). The sensation relations are then the\nplace-holder of the categories (forms) of sensible space and of\ngroups. Poincaré’s conventions in geometry are the tool\nthat he uses to close the gap between the exactness of a\nstructure and the objectivity of sensation-relations based on\nan imagined ostensive contact (reflecting on sensations). If\nthis interpretation is right, then Poincaré’s concept of\nstructure is not the new Hilbertian one that derives from the\naxiomatization of Euclidean geometry, but rather constitutes a\ndevelopment of the traditional algebraic concept of structure and\nconcerns continuous groups. His epistemological stance has a strong\naffinity with Schlick’s General Theory of Knowledge.\nGiven, on the one hand, that “pure quality is\nimpenetrable” and, on the other hand, that knowledge is\npublic—“no discourse, no objectivity”\n(Poincaré 1905b: 179; 1913b: 347–48)—how is it\npossible that although we cannot be sure that our experience\nis the same, we can intersubjectively know the same thing?\nThe answer is found in the thesis that “science is a system of\nrelations” (Poincaré 1905b: 181; 1913b: 349).  \nContrary to in re structuralists, Poincaré’s\nstructure of a general group is not ontologically but rather\nepistemically dependent on its instances. The faculty capable of\ncreating the general concept of a group is the expression of a form of\nour understanding “prior to all experience”\n(Poincaré 1898: 41). He defends a kind of epistemological\nPlatonism or anti-nominalism (Linnebo 2011), in which intuition is a\ncognitive faculty used to grasp the general group structure. The\nstructure is not itself a position in a meta-structure, but the\npsycho-physiological procedure is the way in which we know of its\nexistence in our mind. Poincaré uses it as a metamathematical\n“instrument which serves not to represents things to ourselves,\nbut to reason” upon the psycho-physiological genesis of\nreal actions with imagined sensations\n(Poincaré 1898: 41). The genesis of geometry is based on an\nepistemological process founded on previous classifications, carried\nout as a relationship between a structure as norm of invariance and\n“conventionally” adapted systems as instantiations and\nexemplifications of these norms. \nThe exemplification of the structure by a large variety of systems\n(imagined sensations, mathematical and physical facts, objects) having\nsome characters in common is an aesthetic operation, not a logical\none. The general group structure is given by intuition rather than by\nan explicit identity criterion and the determination of its formal\nproperties expressed by the means of sub-groups is the result of a\nmastery occasioned by concrete systems (samples). The mathematician\ncreates structural harmony as does an artist. In art, the structure\ncan be implicit, while in mathematics it is normally explicit, even if\nit is qualitative. The number of their exemplifications, i.e., of\ntheir applications, is the aesthetic element “uniting”\nboth, mathematical and artistic structures (Poincaré\n1905b: 104; 1913b: 280). There is for example nearly no mathematical\ntheory where the notion of group does not intervene by giving the same\nname to different “things” (Poincaré 1921: 137).\nPoincaré’s geometric or algebraic conventions form a\nconceptual construction that is irreducible to a combination of\nclearly distinguished parts of structural elements and\naesthetic exemplifications. In this sense the result of the\npsycho-physiological genesis of geometry is as a whole a system\nunderstood as a pragmatic procedure.  \nThe insight that geometry is the result of a genesis where the\ndescription and the construction of objects are two aspects of the\nsame procedure leads to an alternative interpretation of Quine’s\nthesis of the incompleteness of mathematical objects and the ideas to\nwhich they belong. The freedom that we have to choose a geometric\ndistance function is due neither to a general skepticism nor to a\npurely verbal accommodation with respect to a set theoretic\ndevelopment of the foundations of mathematics that itself possesses\nontological commitment, but rather to an ontological peculiarity of a\nnew sort (Quine 1986: 401). Structures (groups) are not patterns whose\npositions are given entities. The genesis of the geometrical metric\nstructure is as the advent of relations linked to the concrete in an\naesthetic analysis of the general idea, rather than either\nthe creation of the concrete material from the general idea (a group)\nor as the creation of the category (a group) from the concrete. What\nPoincaré calls “objective reality common to many thinking\nbeings” is exactly the “harmony expressed by mathematical\nlaws” (Poincaré 1905b: 23; 1913b: 209). To move along\nthis predefined track of a reconciliation of aesthetic sensitivity and\ncognition leads directly to Nelson Goodman (1969). \nAs Philippe Nabonnand has remarked, Poincaré’s\npresentation of geometrical space is as a whole in fact circular: \nin his 1898 paper, [Poincaré] put forward a (mathematical)\nexplanation of the three dimensions of space. He observed that the\nEuclidean group, selected after many conventions, can be seen as\nacting on a space of three, four or five dimensions. The choice of a\nthree-dimensional space is justified by considerations of commodity.\nUnfortunately, Poincaré’s argument is viciously circular\nbecause the choice of the Euclidean group was grounded on Lie’s\nclassification of transformation-groups operating on \\(\\mathrm{R}^3\\)\n(Heinzmann and Nabonnand 2008: 171).  \nNevertheless, Poincaré noted his mistake and introduced in\n1905b a three-dimensional physical continuum in order to justify his\nutilization of Lie’s classification. The consequence is that\ngeometry is not independent of any further mathematical space, the\nstructure of which must be presupposed as a primitive notion, contrary\nto the pragmatically suggested group notion existing in our mind. \nConcerning the epistemological status of mechanics, Poincaré\npositions himself, as in his discussion of geometry, as holding a\nposition between empiricism and a priorism (Poincaré 1902: 111;\n2017: 71). The principles of mechanics certainly have, according to\nPoincaré, an empirical origin, but they nonetheless surpass the\nbounds of strict empiricism since the experience that leads us to an\nexperimental result rests on the repetition of a phenomenon and\ntherefore requires physical or empirical induction (Poincaré\n1902: 26; 2017: 3). Generalizations are either a hypothesis, a law, or\na confirmable thesis obtained by the fact that each result of\nempirical physics can be generalized in different ways. Indeed, we are\nobligated to simplify the experimental data and the criterion of\nsimplicity is relative to the analytical apparatus we employ, so\nconsequently, simplicity may be only be “apparent.” Such\nanalysis of experimental data may even force us to adjust the\nexperiment. Reflecting on the generalization process shows that it\npresupposes a belief in the unity and simplicity of nature\n(Poincaré 1902: 159–165; 2017: 105–108). However,\nthis is only the most general kind of presupposition that is required.\nThe hypothesis of the law of inertia, for example, cannot be obtained\nexcept with respect to the preexisting category of the differential\nequation, which thus replaces the physical induction that leads to a\nsimple experimental fact. \nPoincaré distinguished empirical laws from conventional\nprinciples. How does one move from “simple” empirical\nlaws, understood as confirmable hypotheses, to principles as\nthe result of a conventional decision to withdraw a confirmable\nhypothesis from the judgment of experience? In mechanics he employs\nthe same methodological procedure as in geometry with regard to\nclasses of displacements and groups:  \nWhen a law has received a sufficient confirmation from experiment, we\nmay adopt two attitudes: Either we may leave this law in the fray; it\nwill then remain subject to incessant revision, which without any\ndoubt will end by demonstrating that it is only approximate. Or else\nwe may elevate it into a principle by adopting conventions.\n(Poincaré 1905b: 165–166; 1913b: 335)  \nThus, in outline, a generalization scheme in physics is presented as\nfollows: From the phenomenon we move by physical induction to the\nexperimental result and, thanks to differential equations, to the laws\nand the general hypotheses which, by a common decision of the\nscientific community, can be elevated finally to a principle.\nCertainly this is only a general scheme and the concrete process of a\ngeneralization could include many variations. The difference between\nthe geometric axiom as a “disguised definition” and the\nphysical law as a principle seems to define Poincaré’s\nepistemological criterion that distinguishes geometry from mechanics\nfrom the ontological point of view. In geometry, the convenient\nconventions (or definitions) are chosen as a function of objects\n(solid bodies, rays) which are not the objects of the geometry.\nFurthermore, in geometry we presuppose the category of group, so\ngeometry requires a double conventional abstraction. In mechanics, the\nconventions are useful and apply to physical objects (Poincaré\n1902: 152; 2017: 100). In this context we presuppose the categories of\nempirical or physical induction and of differential equations as\nnecessary preconditions for doing science. Poincaré’s\napproach therefore integrates specifically Kantian elements, the idea\nthat there are preconditions, while still completely eliminating the\ntranscendental basis of these components that we find in Kant’s\nthought.  \nPoincaré’s argument in favor of the necessary\ntransmission of the conventional character of geometry to physics is\nbased on an analogy, which shows another important relationship\nbetween geometry and physics. The methodological function of\ntransformation groups with respect to the representative space\ncorresponds to the function of geometry with respect to physics. The\nanalogy runs as follows: Just as the law of displacements may\ncorrespond only approximately to the law of groups and is consequently\nconsidered to be the result of two component changes, the first being\na displacement, and the second a qualitative alteration, so\nPoincaré regards the physical “complex” relation\nbetween two bodies \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) as the result of two\ncomponents. The first is regarded as a “simple”\ngeometrical principle, while the second is itself composed of two\n“epistemological laws.” The bodies \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\nare related to figures \\(A'\\); and \\(B'\\) of the\ngeometrical space so that \n\\(R'\\) being a “properly” geometrical\nproposition, and the \\(r_i\\) expressing the\nrelationships between objects of the representative space and the\ngeometrical space, such as the relation between solid bodies and\nmotion invariants. Poincaré declares that by changing the\nrelations \\(r_i\\), the geometrical proposition\n\\(R'(A', B')\\) could even serve to\ndescribe the relationship between two different physical bodies (see\nPoincaré 1905b: 166–67; 1913b: 336). Poincaré\nthereby rules out any application of geometry to physics based on a\nstructural isomorphism with a presupposed reality (Mette 1986:\n75–80).  \nThe conventional elements in physical theories were often\nmisunderstood by Poincaré’s contemporaries. So, for\nexample, his affirmation that neither of the two propositions\n‘The earth turns round’ and ‘The earth does not turn\nround’ is “more true than the other in the kinematic\nsense,” is not a rehabilitation of Ptolemy’s system, but\nthe consequence of the fact that in physics, the empirical systematic\n(not epistemic) under-determination of theories is limited by unifying\nconsiderations: “A physical theory is by so much the more true,\nas it puts in evidence more true relations.” So, the ‘The\nearth turns round’ has a richer content expressed by the\n“flattening of the earth, the rotation of Foucault’s\npendulum, the gyration of cyclones, the trade-winds, and who knows\nwhat else?” (Poincaré 1905b: 184–85; 1913b: 353).\nHowever, in physics proper—that is, in optics and in\nelectrodynamics—the conventional elements seem to be further\nweakened: \nWe come across a different kind of hypothesis and fully perceive its\nproductivity. Undoubtedly, the theories seem at first sight fragile\nand the history of science shows us how fleeting they are. However,\nthey do not entirely die out and something remains of each of them. It\nis this something that we must try to sort out, for there and only\nthere is true reality (Poincaré 1902: 26; 2017:\n3–30). \nIn fact, Poincaré’s model of explanation, founded on a\nminimum of well-confirmed hypotheses erected into principles and from\nwhich any meaningful propositions can be deduced, is called into\nquestion by Maxwell’s approach. In view of the crisis in physics\nthat was brewing toward the end of the 19th century,\nPoincaré’s general position will not work without posing\nproblems with respect to concrete principles. We will briefly mention\nthe most interesting case, that of the application of the principle of\nrelativity to electrodynamics, which is one of the most discussed\nsubjects by historians (e.g., Goldberg 1967; Paty 1993; Miller 1996a;\nZahar 2001; Darrigol 2004; Rouché 2008; Walter 2011, DiSalle\n2014)—not least because Poincaré and Einstein did not\ncite each other on relativity despite the fact that Einstein read\nPoincaré’s Science and Hypothesis before 1905\nand Poincaré wrote Einstein a recommendation letter sometime\nafter their only meeting at the first Solvay Congress in 1911 (Walter\n2007: chap. 59.3). What is uncontroversial is that Poincaré\ndiscovered salient points of the special theory of relativity, such as\nan operational definition of clock-synchronization to the first order\nin \\(v/c\\), and a relativistic formula of the composition of\nspeed, the determination of the structure of the Lorentz-group. \nSince the Maxwell-Lorentz equations for electromagnetics are not\nGalileo-covariant, the classical principle of relativity according to\nwhich measurement in one inertial reference frame can be converted to\nanother by Galilean transformation is called into question. Using in\nhis famous St. Louis lecture of 1904 the designation (physical)\n“principle of relativity” (Poincaré 1905a: 607),\nwhich does not apply “to finite equations that are directly\nobserved, but to differential equations” (Poincaré 1913a:\n103; 1963: 19), Poincaré reports that Lorentz introduces the\nconjectures (i.e., the ad hoc hypotheses) of “local\ntime” and of “uniform contraction in the direction of\nmotion” in an attempt to save the principle in its application\nto the electromagnetic domain (see Poincaré 1905b: 132 ff.;\n1913b: 305 ff.). It was indeed Poincaré (1906) who made\nLorentz’s theory fully compatible with the relativity principle.\nWe are thus naturally inclined, remarks Poincaré, to admit the\npostulate of relativity in every domain. In postulating the principle\nas a “general law of Nature” (Poincaré 1906: 495),\nits extended form finds its origin in the Galilean principle, and its\nmotivation in its compatibility with a theory explaining why no\nexperiment is able to inform us of the earth’s motion relative\nto the ether. So, the principle is an element of a work in progress\ncontaining several conjectures and there is the possibility that it\nwill lose its soundness (Poincaré 1905b: 146; 1913b: 319). \nIn fact, there are now two principles: the old one, which was made\nimmune to revision by considering it as a conventional\nprinciple and which serves to construct geometrical space via the\ntransformation group that is the mathematical expression of the\npsychological principle of the free mobility of “rigid”\nbodies, and the new one, where the invariance concerns differential\nequations and where the geometry could now be rooted in the Lorentz\ngroup at the price of accepting a four-dimensional spacetime with\nindefinite metric (see Gray 2012: 111; Walter 2009). So, it seems that\nPoincaré’s old conventional construction of space where\nhe prefers Euclidean geometry on the basis of considerations of\nsimplicity and commodity must be subsumed to a new convention on\nspace-time. Indeed, Poincaré never abandons Galilean spacetime\nbut it is not even clear if before 1912 the principle of special\nrelativity with Lorentz covariance (instead of with Galilean\ncovariance) was confirmed well enough to be unassailable by experiment\nand to make the principle with Galilean covariance unfruitful (Walter\n2009). This situation is what Larry Sklar has called\n“transient” underdetermination,  \nthat is, theories which are not empirically equivalent but\nare equally (or at least reasonably) well confirmed by all the\nevidence we happen to have in hand at the moment (see Stanford 2009\nand Sklar 1975: 380)  \nwhile waiting to make a decision in face of new results. \nThere is no doubt that Poincaré’s work has been very\ninfluential both in the sciences and in philosophy. His geometric\nconventionalism was widely discussed at the time it was first\npresented and also greatly influenced the logical empiricists, who\nwere linked to Poincaré’s follower Louis Rougier (Rougier\n1920), one of the organizers of the 1935 Paris congress on scientific\nphilosophy. Poincaré’s conventionalism was widely\ndiscussed again in the post-WWII literature on spacetime and\nrelativity theory in the philosophy of science. His intervention in\nthe philosophy of mathematics has been a source of great inspiration\nto critics of logicism and others. In the tradition of Kant and Mach,\nwho excluded “metaphysical” speculations from philosophy\nof science, Poincaré is also considered to be one of the\nfounders of this field as a discipline (Brenner 2003; Moulines 2006).\nPoincaré is considered the founder of structural realism and is\nthought to have held a productive middle of the road position on\nscientific realism (Worrall 1989). His discussion of scientific\ncreativity has spawned a literature of its own and became a standard\naccount of how scientific creativity works. His work on the stability\nof the solar system influenced the development of chaos theory and the\nclassical concept of causality based on the fact that similar causes\nproduce similar effects. Poincaré is one of the starting points\nfor arguments showing the compatibility of ontological determinism and\nepistemological indeterminism. His famous recurrence theorem raised\nquestions for statistical mechanics and his work on probability theory\ninfluenced the early work of Hans Reichenbach (Glymour and Eberhardt\n2012).  \nInsofar as Poincaré’s philosophical views focus on the\ncomprehension and explanation of the activities and practice of\nmathematicians and scientists, his approach seems more current today\nthan the approach of the logical empiricists, given that the\ncontemporary “practical turn” in the philosophy of science\npays less tribute to logic and the foundations of mathematics by\nformal representation than did the canonical tradition of the 20th\ncentury philosophy of science. His approach restores the depth to some\nof the critical discussions that the Vienna Circle undertook in the\nspirit of Poincaré from the 1930s onward (Heinzmann 2016).\nThough they are missing from standard histories in philosophy of\nscience, the Swiss philosopher Ferdinand Gonseth, the French\nphilosophers Jean Cavaillès and Albert Lautman, the Italian\nepistemologist Federico Enriques and, finally, Jean Piaget, all have\nin common a focus on mathematical practice that rejects the logical\nempiricists’ strict distinction of analytic and synthetic\npropositions. \nPoincaré is often invoked in the philosophy of mathematics\nbecause of his discussions of the paradoxes and his diagnosis, which\nbecame the vicious circle principle. According to\nPoincaré’s pragmatic and anti-Platonist standpoint,\nmathematical definitions and proof-procedures should be limited to\npredicative ones. Herman Weyl (1918) was the first to propose a\npredicative continuum, while later Lorenzen (1955, 1965) and,\nespecially, Kreisel (1960) and Feferman (1964) each tried to find\npredicatively definable sets following Poincaré’s rough\nsketch. Hintikka (2012) argues that logicians and mathematicians did\nnot know how to implement Poincaré’s insight because they\ndid not pay enough attention to the quantifier dependence and\nindependence and proposes a solution with IF-logic.\nPoincaré’s critical remarks about the logicist project\nand about the new logic in general have been evaluated many times and\ncontinue to be discussed in the literature and to inspire those with\nsympathy towards intuitionistic or Kantian points of view (Cassirer\n1910; Dingler 1931; Folina 1992; Goldfarb 1988; Heinzmann 1995).\nAlthough the influences on Wittgenstein’s work are notoriously\ndifficult to interpret, there are clearly evident similarities to\nPoincaré’s fundamental views (Rodych 2011). \nMoritz Schlick is mainly responsible for bringing an interpretation of\nPoincaré’s conventionalism to the Logical Empiricists. In\nparticular, he advocated Poincaré’s conventionalism (or\nat least what he thought of as Poincaré’s\nconventionalism) in letters to Hans Reichenbach in regards to\nReichenbach’s 1920 book The Theory of Relativity and A\nPriori Knowledge (Coffa 1991, Parrini 1998, Friedman 1999;\nOberdan 2009). Later, however, Schlick criticized generalized\nconventionalism in his reprinted and widely-read article of 1935\n“Are Natural Laws Conventions?” Reichenbach took up\ngeometric conventionalism in his Philosophy of Space and Time\n(1928) and Carnap generalized conventions, taking them to be the\nadoption of a formal language of science. Poincaré was widely\ncited and discussed in the heyday of the Logical Empiricists, though\nthe meaning of his conventionalism is often distorted, for example,\nwhen Popper characterizes Poincaré’s conventions as\nanalytic judgments (Popper 2007: chap. VIII). Einstein’s\ninterpretation of Poincaré in his important article\n“Geometry and Experience” is emblematic of the fate of his\ngeometric conventionalism in the philosophical literature. Einstein\nsays there that although current physics (i.e., the General Theory of\nRelativity) is not in accord with Poincaré’s views, he is\ncorrect “sub specie aeterni,” that is in\nprinciple in an ideal physics (Einstein 1921). Thus the specific\ngeometric conventionalism that Poincaré advocated was opposed,\nbut a generalized form of conventionalism was frequently embraced.\n \nAlthough Poincaré’s ideas are not the central focus of\nthe discussion of spacetime theories that blossomed in the 1960s and\n1970s, his views are always in the background. Adolf Grünbaum\n(1968) defended geometric conventionalism, albeit with his own unique\narguments rather than Poincaré’s, and critics of\nGrünbaum and of conventionalism generally could not help but\ndirect some of their attention to Poincaré who was rightly seen\nas the preeminent precursor to all further work on geometric\nconventionalism. Some of this literature does directly engage with\nPoincaré, notably Torretti (1978).  \nIn 1989 John Worrall published a paper defending structural realism as\n“the best of both worlds” in the debate over scientific\nrealism, drawing his inspiration from Poincaré. The view came\nto be widely discussed in the philosophy of science and spawned\nfurther elaborations and differentiations into different types, such\nas ontic and epistemic structural realism (Worrall 1989; Ladyman\n2009). Poincaré’s epistemological thesis that all\nstatements depend, at least partially, on a conventional conceptual\nframework is generalized in Kasimir Ajdukiewicz’s radical\nconventionalism (Ajdukiewicz 1978) and is related to the Quinean\nnotion that there are logically incompatible but empirically\nequivalent theories (Quine 1990: chap. 41). (See Poincaré\n1905b: chap. X.3, which is embedded in the discussion about nominalism\nwith his former pupil Édouard Le Roy for the limits that\nPoincaré places on these ideas.) \nPoincaré also spawned a large literature on scientific\ncreativity with his brief account of his discovery while stepping onto\nan omnibus during an outing of the relation between Fuchsian (or\nautomorphic) functions and non-Euclidean geometries:  \nAt the moment when I put my foot on the step the idea came to me,\nwithout anything in my former thoughts seeming to have paved the way\nfor it, that the transformation that I had used to define the Fuchsian\nfunctions were identical with those of non-Euclidean geometry. (1908:\n49; 1913b: 387–388)  \nThe story has been very widely cited and his four-step account of how\none arrives at novel ideas has been adopted by those presenting the\ndevelopment of creative ideas in analogy with Darwinian blind\nvariation, such as Donald Campbell (1987 [1960]: 99–100) and\nDean K. Simonton (1988: 27–33; 1995: 468–86; 1999:\n32–4); see Kronfeldner for a critical survey of the literature\n(2011: esp. 64–65). Poincaré’s creativity has also\nbeen analyzed and compared to that of other scientists, especially\nEinstein, by Arthur Miller (1984, 1992, 1996b, 1997).  \nPoincaré’s writings influenced artists (Henderson 1983),\nespecially the cubist movement which associated their artistic\napproach to that occupied by non-Euclidean geometries in the history\nof geometry. In “the mathematician of Cubism” Maurice\nPrincet closely studied the work of Poincaré (Décimo\n2006) and how he influenced Picasso among others, and Albert Gleizes\nand Jean Metzinger (1912), the authors of the famous treatise\n“Du Cubisme” that provides theory to the artistic\nmovement. Poincaré’s work combines the sensations\nproduced by movement with the sense of touch (as in Science and\nHypothesis) to create the fourth dimension. Maurits Cornelis\nEscher uses a paving motif of the Poincaré disk of the\nhyperbolic plane in order to represent an infinite structure in a\nfinite space (see Dunham 2010 (Other Internet Resources), Figure 3, p.\n3).

This survey will focus on Poincaré’s\nphilosophy. Concerning Poincaré’s scientific legacy, see\nBrowder (1983) and Charpentier, Ghys, Lesne (2010).\n\n\nPoincaré’s philosophy is primarily that of a scientist\noriginating in his own daily practice of science and in the scientific\ndebates of his time. As such, it is strongly influenced by the\nreflections of Ernst Mach, James Maxwell and Hermann von Helmholtz.\nHowever, his thinking is also strongly influenced by the philosophical\ndoctrines of his time (those of Emile Boutroux, who was his\nbrother-in-law, but also of Jules Lachelier, William James, etc.), and\nis imbued with the neokantism that was very much in vogue.\nNevertheless, one must not assume that Poincaré’s\n“Kantian” vocabulary is exactly that of the German\nphilosopher, given that Poincaré often radically changes the\nmeaning of Kant’s terms.\n\n\nIn 1880, he collaborated with Émile Boutroux on the edition of\nLeibniz’ Monadology, providing an article comparing the\nphysics of Descartes and Leibniz. It was not until the 1890s, however,\nthat he became a central actor in the French philosophical scene,\nnotably through his continuous involvement in the Revue de\nmétaphysique et de morale (in which he published some\ntwenty articles) and his participation in the organization of a large\nnumber of events: the celebration of the centenary of the birth of\nDescartes, the International Congress of Philosophy of 1900, and the\ninternational edition of the works of Leibniz.\n\n\nPoincaré is best known for his critique of logicism and for his\ngeometric conventionalism. The two traditions interpreting\nPoincaré’s work thus reflect, on the one hand, a\nphilosophy of mathematics that endorses his intuitionist tendency and\nhis polemics against logicism or formalism, and, on the other hand,\nhis conventionalism both in the philosophy of science and in a broad\nlinguistic sense. In reality, these intuitionistic and formal aspects\nare two sides of the same coin, given that Poincaré always\nsupports a single position aimed at a reconstruction of the process of\nunderstanding scientific theories (see Heinzmann 2010). Neither\nformalistic nor intuitionist nor empiricist, Poincare opens a path\nlying between a realist and an anti-realist theory of mathematical\nknowledge.\n\n\nAfter providing a short biographical sketch, we will present\nPoincaré’s views organized as follows: \n\nJules Henri Poincaré was born on April 29, 1854 in Nancy in the\nLorraine region of France. His father was professor of Hygiene in the\nSchool of Medicine at the University of Nancy. His cousin Raymond was\nto become the President of the Republic of France during the period\n1913–1920 and his younger sister Aline married the philosopher\nEmile Boutroux. Henri was a precocious student who rose immediately to\nthe top of his class, excelling in both science and letters. At age\n13, his teacher told his mother that “Henri will become a\nmathematician … I would say a great mathematician”\n(Bellivier 1956: 78). During the Franco-Prussian war in 1870 the\nGermans occupied Nancy and the Poincaré family was obliged to\nbillet the secretary of the civil commissar of Nancy, with whom Henri\nwould have a round of conversation each night after dinner in order to\nimprove his German.  \nIn 1871 Poincaré passed the exams in letters with the grade\n“good” and that in science with the grade\n“fair.” He received a zero in mathematics for answering a\ndifferent question from the one that was asked, apparently having\nmisunderstood the question. He then took the preparatory classes in\nmathematics and was first in his class, also first in the academic\ncompetition and first in the national competition (concours\ngénéral) in elementary mathematics. In Paris, he entered\nthe École Polytechnique in 1873 and after graduating in 1875\n(second in his class having apparently lost points for his inability\nto draw), entered the École des Mines. After brief service as a\nmine inspector, he submitted a dissertation on partial differential\nequations and was then hired to teach the course on differential and\nintegral calculus at the University of Caen. In 1880 he submitted a\npaper solving a problem in the theory of differential equations to the\ncompetition for the grand prize in mathematics of the Academy of\nSciences in Paris. For the first time he made use of non-Euclidean\ngeometry, which was seen by most of his contemporaries as purely\nspeculative.  \nPoincaré married Louise Poulain d’Andecy on April 20,\n1881 and soon thereafter joined the faculty of sciences at the\nUniversity of Paris. In 1886 he succeeded G. Lippmann in the chair of\nmathematical physics and probability. In 1896 he was given the chair\nof mathematical astronomy and celestial mechanics, in 1902 he was\nnamed professor of theoretical electricity at the Bureau de Poste et\nTélégraph and in 1904 professor of general astronomy at\nthe École Polytechnique. Poincaré also worked at the\nFrench Bureau des Longitudes from 1893 (Galison 2003).  \nIn 1889 Poincaré won a prize from the King of Sweden for a\nquestion posed by Weierstrass on the stability of the solar system,\nthat is, the three-body (or \\(n\\)-body) problem in classical\nmechanics. Despite a mathematical error that he discovered at the last\nmoment (after questions raised by the Swedish mathematician Lars\nEdvard Phragmén) and frantically corrected, the work was\nimportant for its use of topology and as a founding document in chaos\ntheory, for Poincaré showed that in general, the stability of\nsuch systems cannot be demonstrated. It is also in this context that\nhe proved his famous recurrence theorem. \nPoincaré joined the French Academy of Sciences in 1887 and\nbecame its president in 1906. He was elected to the Académie\nFrançaise in 1908 on the basis of his three books on\nphilosophical and general problems in science. He also became a\ncorresponding member of many international scientific organizations.\nHis travel included a trip to America to give a lecture at the St.\nLouis World’s Fair in 1904. Poincaré’s extensive\ncorrespondence demonstrates the extent of his connection to the\nscientific community of his time (Nabonnand 1999; Walter 2007). He\nalso co-signed a report that played an important role in the\nrehabilitation of Dreyfus.  \nPoincaré is also famous for his 1904 conjecture concerning the\ntopology of three-dimensional spheres which remained one of the major\nunsolved problems in mathematics until the Russian mathematician\nGrigori Perelman succeeded in demonstrating it nearly one hundred\nyears later. Poincaré lectured on contemporary mathematical\nphysics for years and was very much abreast of current developments.\nPopularizer of science, pedagogue, man of letters, he became an icon\nof the popular press (see Rollet 2017, XLVI). In all he published over\nfive hundred scientific papers and over thirty books. He died July 17,\n1912 in Paris from a blood clot to the brain which was a complication\nof surgery, survived by his wife and their four children (see Rollet\n2000, Boutroux 2012, Ginoux and Gerini 2012).  \nPoincaré sets out a hierarchical view of the sciences in\nScience and Hypothesis (1902), although he does not\nexplicitly use this terminology. In his view the special sciences\npresuppose physics, which presupposes geometry, which in turn\npresupposes arithmetic. Poincaré treats topics in a serial\norder—first arithmetic, then geometry, then physics, etc. In the\nintroduction, Poincaré says that “Such is the conclusion we\nwill reach, but to get there, we must first review the sequence of\nsciences, from arithmetic and geometry to mechanics and experimental\nphysics” (Poincaré 1902, 2017, 2). The hierarchy\ninterpretation has recently come under criticism in an important pair\nof articles (Dunlop 2016 and 2017). We believe that clarifying what is\nmeant by hierarchy will resolve this debate. What is the relationship\nbetween arithmetic, geometry and the rest of the sciences? Michael\nFriedman originated the claim that Poincaré presents the\nsciences in a hierarchy, and in doing so makes clear that what he\nmeans by hierarchy is that each lower level must first be in place in\norder to be able to proceed to the next level: \nBut the point perhaps can be made even more clearly if we consider\nNewton’s theory of universal gravitation. For Newton’s\nPrincipia had already shown clearly how we can empirically\ndiscover the law of universal gravitation—on the presupposition,\nthat is, of the Newtonian laws of motion and Euclidean geometry.\nWithout these presuppositions, however, we certainly would not have\nbeen able to discover the law of gravitation. And the same example\nalso shows clearly how each level in the hierarchy of sciences\npresupposes all of the preceding levels: we would have no laws of\nmotion if we did not presuppose spatial geometry, no geometry if we\ndid not presuppose the theory of mathematical magnitude, and of course\nno mathematics at all if we did not presuppose arithmetic (Friedman\n1999, 76). \nNote that Friedman mentions the theory of mathematical magnitude as\nwell. There is a step between arithmetic and geometry, namely the\ntheory of mathematical magnitude, which is precisely the topic of\nChapter 2 of Science and Hypothesis. The theory of\nmathematical magnitude presupposes the possibility of indefinite\nrepetition, and therefore something like mathematical induction, which\nPoincaré presents as central to arithmetic in Chapter 1 of\nScience and Hypothesis. \nThere is direct evidence that Poincaré thought that mathematics\nmust be in place before we can do any empirical science. For example,\nin the opening of Chapter 12 of Science and Hypothesis, he\nremarks that: “The purpose of mathematical theories is not to reveal\nthe true nature of things. Such a claim would be unreasonable. Their\nonly goal is to coordinate the physical laws that experiment reveals\nto us, but that we could not even state without the help of\nmathematics” (Poincaré 1902, 2017, 143). Dunlop, by contrast,\nseems to have something much stronger in mind with the idea of the\nhierarchy, which is perhaps why she calls the thesis the dependency\nhierarchy interpretation. She seems to take the interpretation to be a\nthesis of reductionism, that geometry reduces to arithmetic, or at\nleast, the intuitive reasoning used in arithmetic is all that we need\nin geometry. \nCommentators have suggested that the intuition that grounds the use of\ninduction in arithmetic also underlies the conception of a continuum,\nthat the consistency of geometrical axioms must be proved through\narithmetical induction, and that arithmetical induction licenses the\nsupposition that certain operations form a group (Dunlop 2016,\n274). \nDunlop is absolutely correct in saying that this is not\nPoincaré’s view. Rather, he says that we need arithmetic and\nfurther things in order to work in geometry. All that we take\nPoincaré to be saying is that we still need to add, subtract,\nmultiply, and divide when we are doing geometry, but we will be doing\nmore than what we do in arithmetic. The reason that we need a theory\nof magnitude before we can do geometry is because we measure things.\nThe reason we need geometry in classical mechanics is because we are\ndoing things like tracking the elliptical orbits of the planets. Thus,\nwe also agree with Dunlop when she says that “Poincaré’s\nviews of arithmetic and geometry cannot be reconciled by supposing\ngeometry to be founded on arithmetical operations or principles”\n(Dunlop 2016, 306). We need arithmetic, plus group theory, plus the\nconventions in order to have metric geometry. There may be some\nauthors who made reductionist claims, but it is not what we take from\nFriedman’s original presentation. Furthermore, the reductionist\ninterpretation cannot be right when we get to the physical sciences,\nwhere there is clearly more content in the higher-level\nsciences—empirical content that could not\npossibly be reduced to mathematics. \nPoincaré discusses the sciences in a sequence, starting with\narithmetic. Mathematical induction is essential in arithmetic, because\nonly by using it can we make assertions about all numbers.\nPoincaré considers mathematical induction to be a genuine\nsynthetic a priori. He next considers magnitude, which requires\narithmetic, but goes further. Likewise, geometry extends our knowledge\nstill further, but requires the theory of magnitude to make\nmeasurements, and arithmetic to combine numbers. Poincaré then\nconsiders classical mechanics, which again extends our knowledge while\nrelying on the mathematics that came before it. Finally, he considers\ntheories of physics, where we have genuine empirical results, but\nbased on the mathematics, hypotheses and conventions that came before.\nThus the sciences are laid out like expanding concentric circles, with\nnew content being added to the base at each level. The lower levels\nare necessary preconditions for higher levels, but they are not\nsufficient.  \nPoincaré makes hypotheses central to his analysis of science,\ndistinguishing four kinds, which are actually given in two lists of\nthree each (Poincaré 1902: 24 and 166–167; 2017: 1 and\n109-110). Combining the two lists, these are:  \nBy verifiable hypotheses, Poincaré means general statements\nthat have been confirmed by experiment. These are the backbone of\nnatural science and can be seen non-controversially to be compatible\nwith standard accounts of, say, the Hypothetical-Deductive method.\nHowever, it is important for Poincaré that this is not all of\nscience, as he is arguing for a view of science that is between\nempiricism and rationalism.  \nIndifferent hypotheses are ontological in nature and are, for example,\nmechanical models of underlying mechanism. As Poincaré\nemphasizes, these can frequently be exchanged without sacrificing\nempirical accuracy. Take, for example, the propagation of heat, where\n“through the effects of the averages and thanks to the\nmedium’s symmetry, all the differences even out” and we need\nnot inquire how each molecule radiates. Such hypotheses are mere tools\nuseful for thought but “unverifiable” and\n“useless” as such (Poincaré 1902: 169; 2017:\n111). \nNatural hypotheses are necessary conditions for science but are\nexperimentally inaccessible:  \nIt is difficult not to suppose that the influence of very distant\nbodies is altogether negligible, that small motions obey a linear law,\nthat the effect is a continuous function of its cause. I would say the\nsame of the conditions imposed by symmetry. All these hypotheses form,\nso to speak, the foundation common to all the theories of mathematical\nphysics.” Poincaré 1902: 166; 2017: 109)  \nFinally, apparent hypotheses are definitions or conventions rather\nthan actual claims about the world. They therefore may not be\nconsidered to be hypotheses at all, although they are, however, often\nmistaken for hypotheses. Poincaré argues that (metric) geometry\nis the hypothesis most prone to such confusion. Although he presents\narithmetic in Science and Hypothesis without mentioning\nhypotheses explicitly, we can see a role for them in his analysis here\nas well, which we will present in the order that he follows.  \nCentral to Poincaré’s analysis of arithmetic is the\nprinciple of recurrence, or mathematical induction, which he\nconsidered to be a synthetic a priori principle that\n“would then seem so self-evident that we would not be able to\nconceive of the opposite proposition” (Poincaré 1902: 74;\n2017: 42). The principle of mathematical induction is necessary to\nprove general statements about numbers and is thus a necessary tool in\nmathematics. Therefore the principle of mathematical induction is\nsimilar to a natural hypothesis or at least plays a similar role to\nthat of a natural hypothesis. Of course, there are important\ndifferences between mathematical induction and the principle of\ninduction used in the natural sciences. The principle of mathematical\ninduction gives certainty, while the inductive generalizations in the\nnatural sciences give only probability (1902: 27; 2017: 3). The\nprinciple of mathematical induction is based on “the affirmation\nof the power of a mind that knows itself capable of conceiving the\nindefinite repetition of a particular action as soon as this action is\npossible” (1902: 41–42; 2017: 15), so that there can be no\nuncertainty. It can be argued that Poincaré is justified in\nincluding his analysis of arithmetic in Science and\nHypothesis, that is, in his analysis of empirical science, given\nthat there is a striking similarity between the role played by the\nprinciple of mathematical induction and the principle of induction in\nnatural science, which “is as difficult to justify […] as\nit is to get along without it” (1905b: 176; 1913b: 345).  \nPoincaré argues that (metric) geometry is neither a\npriori nor empirical, but rather conventional. It is important to\nnote, however, that these conventions are guided by experience\naccording to Poincaré, rather than being totally arbitrary, as\nsome later writers take conventions to be. This connotation of the\nword ‘convention’ has led to many misrepresentations of\nPoincaré’s views. The existence of consistent alternative\ngeometries shows that the geometry of space cannot be determined a\npriori. The fact that we experience material bodies and their\nrelations, rather than space, leads Poincaré to argue that the\ngeometry of space cannot be determined empirically either. Thus,\nstatements about the geometry of space are apparent hypotheses or\nconventions that appear to be making descriptive claims, however they\nare actually closer to definitions, though they cannot be reduced to\nbeing merely linguistic.  \nPoincaré conceives of our perception of objects as a\ncombination of motor and visual impressions that are at first\nnon-spatial. In order to classify these sensations, which only appear\nbecause of the movement of our bodies, Poincaré says we\nintroduce “sensible space” as a category “of our\nunderstanding” that is not physical space and does not even have\na metric, meaning that “it involves no idea of\nmeasurement” (Poincaré 1898). Sensible space is a\nnecessary condition for our understanding of our place in the world,\nthat is, for our understanding of the objects around us, their\nrelations and how they move, but it is not a form of our sensibility,\nsince individual sensations can exist without it (Poincaré\n1898: 3). Thus sensible space can be seen as an example of a natural\nhypothesis. We introduce a metric to this space in order to measure\ndistance by using the language of group theory, that is, the\nmathematical study of abstract algebraic structures. Groups serve as a\ntool of reasoning about representations of muscular sensations. We can\nchoose a group (or sub-group) which corresponds to the geometry of\nEuclid, Lobachevskii or Riemann to describe space. Poincaré\nproposes a criterion of choice between the three possible geometries,\npositing  \nthe existence of an invariant sub-group, of which all the\ndisplacements are interchangeable and which is formed of all\ntranslations. (1898: 21)  \nOnly Euclidean geometry meets this criterion, so the conventional\nchoice of Euclidean geometry is determined by the simplicity of\ninterchangeability that “translated into analytical language\n[…] means that there are fewer terms in the equations”\n(Poincaré 1898: 43). The empirical underdetermination of the\ngroups has a purely contrastive (arbitrary) character if the groups\nare isolated from the background beliefs furnished by our mind\n(Stanford 2009). “Holistic” considerations (commodity,\nsimplicity) overcome the empirical equivalence between different\ngeometries and give more evidence for Euclidean geometry. In contrast\nto geometry, no choices between alternatives are given in arithmetic.\n \nWe have thus far discussed arithmetic and geometry and examined a\npriori principles, natural hypotheses, and apparent hypotheses.\nIn discussion of natural science Poincaré presents his views on\nverifiable hypotheses, which are characterized by mechanical laws that\nare arrived at through experiment:  \nWhat then is a good experiment? It is one that informs us of something\nbesides an isolated fact, one that allows us to make predictions; that\nis, that allows us to generalize. For without generalization, we\ncannot make predictions. (Poincaré 1902: 158; 2017: 104)  \nThe hypotheses that arise from experiment are verifiable hypotheses.\nThe process of generalization presupposes a belief in the unity and\nsimplicity of nature (see 1902: 161 ff.; 2017: 105 ff.), although it\nis important to remember that for Poincaré experience is always\na complex phenomenon that is theory laden. Any good experiment in\nphysics can be generalized in an infinite number of ways, depending on\nour preconceived ideas, and every generalization results in a\nhypothesis. While he emphasizes the creative role of the scientist,\nPoincaré does not go so far as to say that natural laws are\nsimple definitions, as Le Roy proposed (1901: 143). \nNot all laws are directly accessible to experiment. Generalization in\nphysical science has to take the mathematical form of a differential\nequation in order to grasp complexity and to unify science:  \nIt is not sufficient for each elementary phenomenon to obey simple\nlaws, all those to be combined must obey the same law as well.\n(Poincaré 1902: 171; 2017: 113).  \nThe law of inertia, for example, obtains only with respect to the\npre-existing category of differential equations. These differential\nequations are, in the final analysis, the physical laws:  \nNewton has shown that a law is only a necessary relation between the\npresent state of the world and its immediately subsequent state. All\nthe laws discovered since are nothing else; they are in sum,\ndifferential equations. (Poincaré 1905b: 119; 1913b: 292) \nIn geometry, Poincaré supposes the pre-existent category of a\ngroup. In mechanics, the categorical tools are the principle of\n(empirical) induction and differential equations. So,\nPoincaré’s position represents a hierarchy of elements\nthat, as in Kant, are presupposed as necessary conditions of the\npossibility of the science on the next level. The scheme of\ngeneralization in mechanics appears as follows: Experience provides\ncomplex phenomena, i.e., “a confused mass of facts” which\nwe reduce into a number of elementary phenomena by means of\nexperiment. From these elementary phenomena, we generalize (e.g., via\nthe empirical induction principle) to elementary facts and move, by\nmeans of differential equations, to laws and verifiable hypotheses\nwhose number should be kept as small as possible (Poincaré\n1902: 168–171; 2017: 110–113). Finally, laws can be\nelevated by decree to the status of principles, thus allowing the\nbasic principles of mechanics to become conventions; not arbitrary\nconventions however, since “They would be arbitrary [only] if we\nwere to lose sight of the experiments that led the founders of\nmechanics to adopt the laws and which, as imperfect as these\nexperiments may be, suffice to justify them” (1902: 128; 2017:\n82). For Poincaré the principles of mechanics\n(principle of inertia, law of acceleration, principle of relative\nmotion, etc.) are not hypotheses but rather conventions\n(Poincaré 1902: 151; 2017: 99), although they are of course of\nexperimental origin. These conventions do not constitute a choice\nbetween physical alternatives, but rather must be interpreted as\ndefining the basic terms of a theory. Immune to experimental\ndisconfirmation without being a priori in the classical\nsense, they are necessary preconditions to the sciences further up in\nthe hierarchy (Poincaré 1902: chap. VI and VII).  \nIn the physical sciences proper, such as optics and electrodynamics,\nthe scene changes entirely and principles seem no longer to share the\nconventional character of the geometrical postulates.\nPoincaré’s “indifferent hypotheses” are those\nthat the analyst assumes at the beginning of calculations and that are\nneither true nor false, but rather play roles as positions in a\nstructure. Indifferent hypotheses differ from geometrical conventions\nin one very important sense. While geometry rests on a conventional\ndecree, the structures of physics (mechanics included) do not\nsystematically rest on indifferent hypotheses; rather, these\nhypotheses have only a psychological and pedagogic function as mental\nconstructs that are in a sense superfluous, since they can change\nwhile leaving the experimental results intact. The basis of\nPoincaré’s structural realism can be seen in his idea\nthat the content is superfluous and that it is the relations expressed\nin natural laws that remain through time that are essential to\nscience.  \nHere then is the methodological analogy and link between the principle\nof induction, conventions in the sense of apparent hypotheses and\nverifiable hypotheses. All are guided by experience without being\n(entirely) experimental, and all involve presupposed categories or\nnatural hypotheses. Verifiable hypotheses employ conventional elements\nin the generalization process and may presuppose the (empirical)\nprinciple of induction. Geometrical conventions are apparent\nhypotheses guided by the experience of muscular sensations and involve\nthe category of groups. Both these sorts of hypotheses, verifiable and\napparent, employed in physics and geometry, are in\nPoincaré’s hierarchy of sciences framed on the one hand\nby a priori principles and natural hypotheses that are tools\nboth for mathematicians and experimenters, and on the other hand, by\nindifferent hypotheses and physical principles. The indifferent\nhypotheses are conventional (in the ordinary sense) stipulations of\nontological entities—mechanical models that increase our\ntheoretical insight, while the physical principles are either\nverifiable hypotheses elevated by decree beyond the crucible of\nexperiment or well-founded with respect to the network of actual\nscience.  \nConcerning logic and foundations of mathematics,\nPoincaré’s position is governed by two theses: \nHistorically, both theses are directed broadly against the founders of\nmodern logic and set theory such as Cantor, Peano, Frege, Russell,\nZermelo, and Hilbert. On closer inspection, the historical situation\nis more complicated. With respect to Georg Cantor, for example, we\nmust distinguish his work as a logical-set theoretical method useful\nin treating mathematical problems especially in the theory of\nfunctions on the one hand, and on the other hand, set theory as a tool\nfor foundations or for considerations on infinite cardinality. Through\nGösta Mittag-Leffler, Poincaré was familiar with\nCantor’s work of the first type and uses it in his theory of\nFuchsian functions in 1882 (Poincaré 1882: 1167), even having\npersonal contact with Cantor (see Gray 1991: 22; Cantor 1991: 188; and\nDécaillot 2008: 281). However, Poincaré rejected the\nlater foundational work of Cantor, saying that  \nThere is no actual infinity, the Cantorians have forgotten that, and\nthey have fallen into contradiction. It is true that Cantorism\nrendered services, but that was when it was applied to a real problem\nwhose terms were clearly defined, and we could walk safely.\nLogisticians as Cantorians have forgotten. (Poincaré 1908:\n212–213; 1913b: 484)  \nWhile it has been stressed by all commentators that\nPoincaré’s concerns with the foundations of mathematics\nare very different from those of the logicians, there is no unanimity\non the focus of the dispute. Emile Boutroux and Warren Goldfarb claim\nthat Poincaré is condemning the “logical” point of\nview for not providing psychological conviction (Boutroux 1914;\nGoldfarb 1985), while Detlefsen and Heinzmann argue for a difference\nat the epistemological level rather than a psychological one\n(Detlefsen 1992, 1993; Heinzmann 1995). In a famous response to\nRussell, Poincaré refuses to consider logic or epistemology\nindependently from psychology (Poincaré 1909: 482). It would be\nfalse, however, to believe that he thus conflates logic and\npsychology. Indeed, Poincaré does not use the term psychology\nin the modern sense, but rather in all situations where he wants to\nemphasize the dimension of understanding, in particular its historical\nelements, which he contrasts with the mere correct logical exposition\nof the result. It is therefore not surprising that, according to\nPoincaré, mathematics requires intuition, interpreted as an\nelement of understanding, not only in the context of discovery, but\nequally in the context of justification. As we have already seen, in\narithmetic pure intuition is necessary to justify the complete (or\nmathematical) induction principle. It should also be noted that the\nterm “intuition” is quite ambiguous, a fact that is well\nknown and explicitly discussed by Poincaré himself. In The\nValue of Science, he distinguished three kinds of intuition: an\nappeal to sense and to imagination, generalization by induction, and\nintuition of pure number—whence comes the axiom of induction in\nmathematics. The first two kinds cannot give us certainty, but, he\nsays, “who would seriously doubt the third, who would doubt\narithmetic?” (Poincaré 1905b: 33; 1913b: 216). \nFrom 1905, Poincaré therefore opposed the logicist thesis that\nclaims to be able to prove all mathematical truths without recourse to\nintuition, once the principles of logic are admitted. Poincaré\nsuspected that the logicians were actually making an equivocal use of\nthe term logic and that they no longer sought the former kind, but\nrather a “new logic” containing principles of synthetic\nproof or formations of non-logical concept. He was evidently right\ngiven that not only is the modern logic of predicates richer than the\ntraditional (syllogistic) logic, but in order to carry out the\nlogicist project, one is even led to expand logic again by certain\nset-theoretic postulates of existence. \nAs Detlefsen points out, Poincaré’s most interesting\nargument does not concern the status of the basic laws of the logical\nsystems, but rather the “place of logical inference in\nmathematical proof” (Detlefsen 1992: 349). According to\nPoincaré, today’s admitted validity of a logical, i.e.,\ntopic-neutral, inference from a proposition \\(p\\) to a\nproposition \\(q\\) (in Tarski’s conception: every model of\n\\(p\\) is a model of \\(q)\\) is not enough to sustain\nepistemic growth of mathematical knowledge, which requires\nrather that “\\(p\\) be seen mathematically to imply\n\\(q\\) (i.e., that \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) be seen as united by\na common mathematical structure)” (Detlefsen 1993:\n272). Poincaré insists on the non-invariance of mathematical\nreasoning with respect to its content and advances, so to speak, a\nlocal conception of reasoning (for example, the mathematical induction\nprinciple for arithmetical reasoning). According to this view, a gap\nin a proof is no longer a logical gap, but a gap in the mathematical\nunderstanding (Detlefsen 1992: 360, 366). If\n“formalization” and a universal calculus are, then, no\nlonger the criterion of mathematical rigor, how shall rigor be\nmaintained? Poincaré’s response mentions in particular\nthe condensing of the content of the premises to the content of the\nconclusion by means of intuition. Rigor is obtained by combining Ernst\nMach’s principle of the economy of thought with the concept of\nharmony, that is, thanks to “the fortunate inventions of\nlanguage” that introduce an order-structure, the complexity of a\ndomain of objects is made more harmonious by the introduction of an\ninvariance (see Poincaré 1908: 23–30; 1913b:\n371–375). Thus, in mathematical reasoning, rigor is placed in\nthe context of a “mathematical architecture” whose\nsimplest expression is found in mathematical induction. \nRegarding the antinomies discovered at the turn of the century—\nsuch as Richard’s or Russell’s paradoxes—they are,\naccording to Poincaré, the consequence of an abusive use of\nintuition with respect to abstract entities that arises from the\nadoption of conceptual realism (Platonism). In a definition of the\nform \\(\\exists y \\forall x ((x \\in y) \\leftrightarrow D[x])\\), the\nexistence of the set \\(y\\) is intuitively postulated without any\nrestriction for the predicate \\(D[x]\\). For an anti-Platonist like\nPoincaré was from 1906 on, intuition is not a mode for\nrepresenting an object, but rather concerns our capacity to follow a\nrule. We see this quite clearly in Poincaré’s discussion\nof mathematical induction.  \nWe know that Poincaré hoped to avoid the known antinomies by\nlimiting himself to predicative definitions (see Heinzmann 1985). It\nwas Russell who introduced the terms “predicative” and\n“non-predicative” to highlight the difference between two\nkinds of propositional functions, those that determine and those that\ndo not determine a class. He called the first\n“predicative” and the second\n“non-predicative.” Poincaré attributed the mistake\nof non-predicative definitions to a vicious circle: a definition is\n“non-predicative” if the definiens contains or\nrelates to a totality of which the definiendum is a part. He\nformulated a principle to avoid circularity, which leads directly to\nRussell’s famous vicious circle principle:  \nI recognize further this element of truth in Poincaré’s\nobjection to totality, that whatever in any way concerns all\nof any or some (undetermined) of the members of a\nclass must not be itself one of the members of a class. (Russell 1973\n[1906]: 198)  \nRussell succeeded in developing a theory that respects his principle,\nthe ramified type theory. In Poincaré, we find nothing that is\ncomparable, for he believed that the principle guarded against the\ndefinitional mistakes that he denounced. He did not seriously take up\nthe question and only formulated successively different variants of\nthe principle when he learned from Ernst Zermelo that the proof,\nproposed by Argand and Cauchy, of the fundamental theorem of algebra\nmakes an appeal precisely to the rejected, non-predicative\ndefinitions. Hence, only when the measures taken against the logical\nantinomies affected “real mathematics” did he try to\nmodify the principle. The discussion between Poincaré, Russell,\nPeano, and Zermelo on the measures to take lasted for six years. The\ndifficulty consisted in the obligation to formulate a principle that\nis neither too restrictive for the important results in analysis, nor\ntoo liberal with respect to the formations of concept to be excluded\nby reason of Poincaré’s philosophical position. The\nabsence of a truly convincing solution shows that the analysis of the\nconcept of predicativity with the help of informal methods appeared to\nhave reached its limits. \nIn 1912, the year of Poincaré’s death, Luitzen Egbertus\nJan Brouwer in his inaugural lecture at Amsterdam characterized two\nopposing orientations in mathematics: intuitionism (in large part\nFrench) and formalism (in large part German). The two orientations\nwere represented by the greatest mathematicians of the antagonistic\nFranco-German pairing: Henri Poincaré and David Hilbert\n(Brouwer 1912: 124–125). According to the historians, the\nmodernists are thos eat the beginning of the 20th century who\nsupported an algebraization of the contents up to and including the\nlanguage of signs, while the conservative tendency finds the\njustification of mathematical knowledge before language, that is, in\nthe intellect. The polemics of the period persist today, even though\nits political metaphor (conservatism/modernism) has been reversed.\nSince the death of Bourbaki, it is fashionable to emphasize the\nintuitive aspects of mathematics. Yet, it is remarkable that Brouwer\nhimself criticizes Poincaré’s conflation of “the\nlanguage of mathematics [and] the true mathematical\nconstruction” (Brouwer 1907: 176). Brouwer is quite right to\nemphasize that Poincaré does not separate language and\nmathematics. Poincaré ascribes to language—but not to\nlogic—an essential role in mathematical reasoning. In this\nsense, we may say that Poincaré is, with respect to Brouwer, a\nsemi-intuitionist who is located squarely between the two fronts of\nthe dispute. For him, mathematical reasoning possesses and must\nconserve an intuitive content that defies the formal contents. In\nsummary, the similarities and differences between Poincaré and\nBrouwer can be shown as follows: \nPoincaré was strongly influenced by and attuned to the French\nphilosophical scene, which refers to the Kantian tradition to show the\nlimits of methodological positivism. Members of the so-called\nCritique de la science movement (Benrubi 1928), which\nincludes members of the “Boutroux Circle” (Nye 1979)\nadvocate a mixture of positivism and Neo-Kantianism. They criticize\nboth Comte’s determinism and Kant’s static view of the\nmind’s structure. According to Poincaré, mathematics\nrequires intuition not only in the context of discovery but also in\nthe context of justification, especially in arithmetic and logic. So\nit is not surprising that Poincaré was discussed in German\nphilosophical circles in the Kantian tradition, for example by Ernst\nCassirer (1910), Ilse Rosenthal-Schneider (1914), who is a disciple of\nAlois Rhiel, and Moritz Schlick (1918). Thus, Poincaré was\ntaken to be one of the Neo-Kantian precursors of logical positivism.\nHowever, unlike Kant, the arithmetical “pure intuition”\nPoincaré introduces is intellectual in character and\nPoincaré does not in the least solve the problem of the unity\nof spontaneity and receptivity by the introduction of a pure\nsensibility. Rather, he changes the terms of the Kantian contrast,\nemphasizing the balance between exactness, that which is common to\nmany minds and is transmissible by discourse, and subjective\nacquaintance, which is intransmissible sensation. He expresses this\ndifficult balance in a formula well known due to its popularization by\nEinstein:  \nwhat they [mathematics] have gained in rigor, they have lost in\nobjectivity. It is by distancing themselves from reality that they\nacquired this perfect purity. (Poincaré 1908: 131; 1913b:\n435) \nBecause of his concern for the application of mathematics,\nPoincaré did not confine himself to the perfect purity of\nmathematics. \nThe existence of relatively consistent non-Euclidean geometries leads\nhim to the view that geometric propositions cannot be determined by\na priori intuitions and that it is necessary to study\n“the structural relations between Euclidean and non-Euclidean\ngeometry” (Nye 1979: 111). Poincaré established a famous\ndictionary translating concepts and propositions of\nLobachevskii’s geometry into Euclidean geometry in order to\ncreate a model to show the relative consistency of\nLobachevskii’s geometry (Poincaré 1891: 771; cf. 1902:\n68; 2017: 37). Concerning pure and applied geometry,\nPoincaré holds the modernist-sounding views that we have no\npre-axiomatic understanding of geometric primitives, that rigor\ndemands that we eliminate appeals to intuition in geometry, and that\n(metric) geometry is neither true nor false, not only because we\ncannot verify which one is true, but also because we cannot\nempirically determine the metric geometry of space ‘in\nprinciple.’ When we speak of space, all we can talk about is the\nrelations of physical bodies:  \n[B]ecause of the relativity and passivity of space, they will not\ndepend on the absolute position and orientation of the system. In\nother words, the state of the bodies and their mutual distances at a\ngiven instant will depend only on the state of these same bodies and\ntheir mutual distances at the initial instant, but will in no way\ndepend on the initial absolute position and initial absolute\norientation of the system. For brevity’s sake, this is what I might\ncall the law of relativity. […] [S]uch a statement is\nindependent of any interpretation of the experiments. If the law is\ntrue in the Euclidean interpretation, it will also be true in the\nnon-Euclidean interpretation (Poincaré 1902: 98–99; 2017:\n61–62).  \nIn rejecting physical space, Poincaré held a relationalist view\nof space that goes further than current space-time theories allow\n(Stump 1989; Walter 2010).  \nSince Poincaré so profoundly modifies the traditional view of\ngeometry as the a priori science of space, authors such as\nSchlick, Carnap, and Ernest Nagel (1939, 1979) attribute to him a\nleading role in the development of the formal conception of\nmathematics. Alberto Coffa extends Nagel’s analysis by claiming\nthat there was a crisis in the interpretation of primitive geometrical\nterms in the nineteenth century that led to the development of formal\naxiomatic systems (Coffa 1986). References to a central role played by\nPoincaré can also be found in Joan Richards’ survey\n(Richards 1994) and in Jeremy Gray’s account of the development\nof modernism (Gray 2008). The modernist character of\nPoincaré’s approach is also shown by the fact that he\nmust be ranked with Duhem among those forerunners of logical\nempiricism who survive Quine’s criticism of the movement, not\nprimarily for his holistic thesis concerning theory-confirmation, more\nso for his conception of geometrical conventions as a kind of hybrid\nanalytic-synthetic expressions “guided” by experience and\nfor his ontological “relationalism” which in certain\naspects comes close to Quine’s doctrine. Both attempt to account\nphilosophically for the incompleteness of (scientific) objects. \nPoincaré argues that  \ncontrary to the naive dogmatists’ view, that which science captures\nare not the things themselves, but simply relationships between them.\nBeyond these relations, there is no knowable reality (1902: 25; 2017:\n2). \nThus, he rejects metaphysical realism:  \nNo, beyond doubt a reality completely independent of the mind which\nconceives it, sees or feels it, is an impossibility. A world as\nexterior as that, even if it existed, would for us be forever\ninaccessible(Poincaré 1905b: 23; 1913b: 209)  \nAlthough Quine’s argument (“no entity without\nidentity”) finds a different motivation in a logical context\nquite distant from that of Poincaré’s, the result is\nsimilar. For Quine, mathematical objects are “known only by\ntheir laws” and any other properties that they may have are\nirrelevant (Quine 1969: 44). \nPoincaré’s geometrical conventions and his ontological\nrelationalism are nothing more than two different aspects of his\nstructural approach, as can be seen by considering two parallel\ndebates at the turn of the 20th century on the nature of\ngeometry—one between Henri Poincaré and Bertrand Russell\nand the other between David Hilbert and Gottlob Frege. Poincaré\nand Hilbert argue for a new conception of geometrical systems, while\nFrege and Russell defend a traditional way of looking at these\nsystems. The debate takes up the questions: Which geometry is true?\nWhat is the nature of definitions and axioms? To deal with the\nmultiplicity of geometries, questions about their truth, and the\nmeaning of their primitive terms, Poincaré and Hilbert propose\na radically new view of geometry. They hold that all that we can say\nabout the meaning of ‘point’, ‘straight line’,\n‘distance’, etc. is that which we have stated in the\naxioms or principles of the system, and that geometry is not a set of\ntruths about some previously known objects. Thus Poincaré\nformulates a new view of geometric theories, that geometry does not\nexpress true or false propositions and that there are no special\nobjects which geometry studies. Rather, geometry is just a system of\nrelations that can be applied to many kinds of objects. \nPoincaré argues against Russell’s view of definition,\nclaiming that the meaning of primitive terms can be fixed by the\ngeometrical system in which we are working. Fixing the meaning of\nprimitive terms by the system is the only way to proceed,\nPoincaré argues, because, if we were to take a primitive term\nout of the context of a system, it would lose all meaning:  \nIf one wants to isolate a term and exclude its relations with other\nterms, nothing will remain. This term will not only become\nindefinable, it will become devoid of meaning.\n(Poincaré 1900: 78, Poincaré’s emphasis)  \nAs Poincaré explains in a section entitled “Form and\nMatter” of his Monist article of 1898, the idea is that in\ngeometry the properties of the primitives or of the objects to which\ngeometrical relations are applied are not important at all, as far as\ngeometry is concerned. The set of relations that hold between the\nprimitives constitute the form, not the matter, of geometric objects,\nand these relations are what are studied. The form constitutes the\nrelational aspect of Poincaré’s structuralism. \nBy recognizing Poincaré’s heritage as a structural point\nof view, Schlick insists on the conventional aspect of his\nstructuralism. He sees in Poincaré’s conventions a third\ntype of definition between the implicit definitions of the axiomatic\nmethod and the concrete or ostensive definitions of physical objects.\nThese conventions are, as Friedman observes “crucial for an\nunderstanding of how we achieve a coordination between concepts and\nempirical reality in the mathematical exact sciences” (2007:\n100). As Schlick explains: \nTo define a concept implicitly is to determine it by means of its\nrelations to other concepts. But to apply such a concept to reality is\nto choose, out of the infinite wealth of relations in the world, a\ncertain group or complex and to embrace as a unit by designating it\nwith a name. By suitable choice it is always possible under certain\ncircumstances to obtain an unambiguous designation of the real by\nmeans of the concept. Conceptual definitions and coordinations that\ncome into being in this fashion we call conventions (using this term\nin the narrower sense, because in the broader sense, of course, all\ndefinitions are agreements). It was Henri Poincaré who\nintroduced the term convention in this narrower sense into natural\nphilosophy; and one of the most important tasks of that discipline is\nto investigate the nature and meaning of the various conventions found\nin natural science (Schlick 1925, 91–92). \nAccording to Schlick, Poincaré’s conventions combine\nconceptual definitions and coordinations. Given the fact that both\nexpressions are completely foreign to Poincaré’s style,\nhow should one understand Schlick’s claim? In fact,\nSchlick’s expressions designate two different aspects of\nPoincaré’s structural approach, which pay attention to\nthe fact that Poincaré is not an ante rem\nstructuralist (the ante rem structuralist takes the pattern\nto exist independently of any systems that exemplify it). At first\nglance he seems to be an ontological realist with respect to\nrelational universals (but not with respect to individuals\n(relata)), despite his predicativist attitude. As Elie Zahar\nemphasizes, such a position is not naturally compatible with classical\nsemantics (logic) because this latter “seems unable to interpret\nrelations except through their relata”: one cannot\nconfirm \\(R(a,b)\\) without determining  \nthe referents of both, ‘\\(a\\)’ and\n‘\\(b\\)’ in order then to ascertain whether\n\\(\\lt a,b\\gt\\) belongs to the referent of\n‘\\(R\\)’. (Zahar 2001: 38) \nAn answer to this difficulty can be found by examining four steps of\nPoincaré’s psycho-physiological reconstruction of the\ngenesis of geometry. In his early articles, Poincaré argues\nthat geometry concerns only the relations expressed in the axioms, not\nsome inherent features of the primitives:  \nWhat we call geometry is nothing but the study of formal properties of\na certain continuous group; so we may say, space is a group.\n(Poincaré 1898: 41)  \nThe first step of Poincaré’s construction of geometrical\nspace via groups proceeds from the observable fact that a set of\nimpressions can be modified in two distinct ways: on the one hand\nwithout our feeling muscular sensations, and on the other, by a\nvoluntary motor action accompanied by muscular sensations. So, as in\nCarnap’s Aufbau, the starting point here is the\ndefinition (guided by experience) of two two-place relations: an\nexternal change \\(a\\) (with ‘\\(x a y\\)’ for ‘\\(x\\)\nchanges in \\(y\\) without muscular sensation’) and an internal\nchange \\(S\\) (with ‘\\(x S y\\)’ for ‘\\(x\\) changes in\n\\(y\\) accompanied by muscular sensations’). In the second step,\nhe introduces a classification of external changes, some of which can\nbe brought back to the starting point by an internal change (changes\nof position), while others (changes of state) cannot. One presupposes\nby convention that the internal compensation for external changes is\nexact and not approximate. In the third step, Poincaré defines\nthe equivalence class of changes of position through an identity\ncondition with respect to the compensation by internal changes and\ncalls it a displacement: \nThe fourth step and Poincaré’s main result is that each\nset of displacement classes (external & internal) forms a group in\nthe mathematical sense. The general concept of a group is a form of\nour understanding that “pre-exists in our mind” (1902:107;\n2017: 56 and 68; 1898: 42–43) or an ante rem structure,\nwhich the specific displacement-structure \\((=\\) transformation group)\nexemplifies. Thus, the genesis of geometry is based on an\nepistemological process founded on previous classifications, carried\nout as a relationship between a structure as norm of invariance and\nconventionally adapted systems as instantiations or exemplifications\nof these norms. \nWhere there is a choice between different possibilities, conventions\nonly become involved at a further step of the mathematical\nconstruction where the properties of the transformation group are\nstudied and choices are made concerning distance (a metric). It\nfollows that the Euclidean axiom of distance is not\nexclusively the result of a conventional choice in the\nlinguistic sense, rather, it is a “disguised definition”\nor an “apparent hypothesis.” Poincaré uses the term\n“disguised definition” before 1899, the year of\nHilbert’s famous Foundations of Geometry, to express\nthe fact that language apparently used descriptively is not\ndescriptive in actuality. Certain axioms appear descriptive, but\ninstead define the objectivity of a fact (Poincaré 1899: 274).\nSuch a fact is found to be defined only up to structure, although it\nclearly reflects the truth of certain relations between sensations\nwhose qualities remain unknowable, as shown by Helmholtz and others\n(Poincaré 1905b: 174. \nPoincaré’s often quoted structuralist Credo that\nin mathematics the word “exist” means “that its\ndefintion does not imply a contradiction” (1902: 70; 2017:\n38–39; 1905c: 819), must be seen in a non-Hilbertian light.\nPoincaré’s geometric propositions (conventions), which\nare neither true nor false, are not propositional schemata that can be\nsatisfied by a model. For reasons concerning in particular the\ninvolvement of a vicious circle with respect to the principle of\ncomplete induction, Poincaré rejects the idea of ensuring\nmathematical reliability with a Hilbert-style consistency proof\n(Poincaré 1906: 301; cf. Detlefsen 1986: 59 ff. for a critical\nassessment). Even with respect to geometry, he takes a structural\nposition without, however, disengaging meaning and knowledge\ncompletely from ostension. Nevertheless, Poincaré begins his\nalternative reliability construction only apparently with\nsensations as ostensive contacts with the given, since he is not an\nempiricist. Instead, in a move similar to Helmholtz’s conception\nof intuition as imagined sensible impressions, Poincaré\nintroduces a representation of a two-place sensation relation, based\non the imagination of single sensations. The representation\nof an object in sensible space means nothing other than the\ndeliberate and conscious representation of muscular sensations\nthought necessary to reach the object (Poincaré 1902:\n82; 2017: 48–49). The sensation relations are then the\nplace-holder of the categories (forms) of sensible space and of\ngroups. Poincaré’s conventions in geometry are the tool\nthat he uses to close the gap between the exactness of a\nstructure and the objectivity of sensation-relations based on\nan imagined ostensive contact (reflecting on sensations). If\nthis interpretation is right, then Poincaré’s concept of\nstructure is not the new Hilbertian one that derives from the\naxiomatization of Euclidean geometry, but rather constitutes a\ndevelopment of the traditional algebraic concept of structure and\nconcerns continuous groups. His epistemological stance has a strong\naffinity with Schlick’s General Theory of Knowledge.\nGiven, on the one hand, that “pure quality is\nimpenetrable” and, on the other hand, that knowledge is\npublic—“no discourse, no objectivity”\n(Poincaré 1905b: 179; 1913b: 347–48)—how is it\npossible that although we cannot be sure that our experience\nis the same, we can intersubjectively know the same thing?\nThe answer is found in the thesis that “science is a system of\nrelations” (Poincaré 1905b: 181; 1913b: 349).  \nContrary to in re structuralists, Poincaré’s\nstructure of a general group is not ontologically but rather\nepistemically dependent on its instances. The faculty capable of\ncreating the general concept of a group is the expression of a form of\nour understanding “prior to all experience”\n(Poincaré 1898: 41). He defends a kind of epistemological\nPlatonism or anti-nominalism (Linnebo 2011), in which intuition is a\ncognitive faculty used to grasp the general group structure. The\nstructure is not itself a position in a meta-structure, but the\npsycho-physiological procedure is the way in which we know of its\nexistence in our mind. Poincaré uses it as a metamathematical\n“instrument which serves not to represents things to ourselves,\nbut to reason” upon the psycho-physiological genesis of\nreal actions with imagined sensations\n(Poincaré 1898: 41). The genesis of geometry is based on an\nepistemological process founded on previous classifications, carried\nout as a relationship between a structure as norm of invariance and\n“conventionally” adapted systems as instantiations and\nexemplifications of these norms. \nThe exemplification of the structure by a large variety of systems\n(imagined sensations, mathematical and physical facts, objects) having\nsome characters in common is an aesthetic operation, not a logical\none. The general group structure is given by intuition rather than by\nan explicit identity criterion and the determination of its formal\nproperties expressed by the means of sub-groups is the result of a\nmastery occasioned by concrete systems (samples). The mathematician\ncreates structural harmony as does an artist. In art, the structure\ncan be implicit, while in mathematics it is normally explicit, even if\nit is qualitative. The number of their exemplifications, i.e., of\ntheir applications, is the aesthetic element “uniting”\nboth, mathematical and artistic structures (Poincaré\n1905b: 104; 1913b: 280). There is for example nearly no mathematical\ntheory where the notion of group does not intervene by giving the same\nname to different “things” (Poincaré 1921: 137).\nPoincaré’s geometric or algebraic conventions form a\nconceptual construction that is irreducible to a combination of\nclearly distinguished parts of structural elements and\naesthetic exemplifications. In this sense the result of the\npsycho-physiological genesis of geometry is as a whole a system\nunderstood as a pragmatic procedure.  \nThe insight that geometry is the result of a genesis where the\ndescription and the construction of objects are two aspects of the\nsame procedure leads to an alternative interpretation of Quine’s\nthesis of the incompleteness of mathematical objects and the ideas to\nwhich they belong. The freedom that we have to choose a geometric\ndistance function is due neither to a general skepticism nor to a\npurely verbal accommodation with respect to a set theoretic\ndevelopment of the foundations of mathematics that itself possesses\nontological commitment, but rather to an ontological peculiarity of a\nnew sort (Quine 1986: 401). Structures (groups) are not patterns whose\npositions are given entities. The genesis of the geometrical metric\nstructure is as the advent of relations linked to the concrete in an\naesthetic analysis of the general idea, rather than either\nthe creation of the concrete material from the general idea (a group)\nor as the creation of the category (a group) from the concrete. What\nPoincaré calls “objective reality common to many thinking\nbeings” is exactly the “harmony expressed by mathematical\nlaws” (Poincaré 1905b: 23; 1913b: 209). To move along\nthis predefined track of a reconciliation of aesthetic sensitivity and\ncognition leads directly to Nelson Goodman (1969). \nAs Philippe Nabonnand has remarked, Poincaré’s\npresentation of geometrical space is as a whole in fact circular: \nin his 1898 paper, [Poincaré] put forward a (mathematical)\nexplanation of the three dimensions of space. He observed that the\nEuclidean group, selected after many conventions, can be seen as\nacting on a space of three, four or five dimensions. The choice of a\nthree-dimensional space is justified by considerations of commodity.\nUnfortunately, Poincaré’s argument is viciously circular\nbecause the choice of the Euclidean group was grounded on Lie’s\nclassification of transformation-groups operating on \\(\\mathrm{R}^3\\)\n(Heinzmann and Nabonnand 2008: 171).  \nNevertheless, Poincaré noted his mistake and introduced in\n1905b a three-dimensional physical continuum in order to justify his\nutilization of Lie’s classification. The consequence is that\ngeometry is not independent of any further mathematical space, the\nstructure of which must be presupposed as a primitive notion, contrary\nto the pragmatically suggested group notion existing in our mind. \nConcerning the epistemological status of mechanics, Poincaré\npositions himself, as in his discussion of geometry, as holding a\nposition between empiricism and a priorism (Poincaré 1902: 111;\n2017: 71). The principles of mechanics certainly have, according to\nPoincaré, an empirical origin, but they nonetheless surpass the\nbounds of strict empiricism since the experience that leads us to an\nexperimental result rests on the repetition of a phenomenon and\ntherefore requires physical or empirical induction (Poincaré\n1902: 26; 2017: 3). Generalizations are either a hypothesis, a law, or\na confirmable thesis obtained by the fact that each result of\nempirical physics can be generalized in different ways. Indeed, we are\nobligated to simplify the experimental data and the criterion of\nsimplicity is relative to the analytical apparatus we employ, so\nconsequently, simplicity may be only be “apparent.” Such\nanalysis of experimental data may even force us to adjust the\nexperiment. Reflecting on the generalization process shows that it\npresupposes a belief in the unity and simplicity of nature\n(Poincaré 1902: 159–165; 2017: 105–108). However,\nthis is only the most general kind of presupposition that is required.\nThe hypothesis of the law of inertia, for example, cannot be obtained\nexcept with respect to the preexisting category of the differential\nequation, which thus replaces the physical induction that leads to a\nsimple experimental fact. \nPoincaré distinguished empirical laws from conventional\nprinciples. How does one move from “simple” empirical\nlaws, understood as confirmable hypotheses, to principles as\nthe result of a conventional decision to withdraw a confirmable\nhypothesis from the judgment of experience? In mechanics he employs\nthe same methodological procedure as in geometry with regard to\nclasses of displacements and groups:  \nWhen a law has received a sufficient confirmation from experiment, we\nmay adopt two attitudes: Either we may leave this law in the fray; it\nwill then remain subject to incessant revision, which without any\ndoubt will end by demonstrating that it is only approximate. Or else\nwe may elevate it into a principle by adopting conventions.\n(Poincaré 1905b: 165–166; 1913b: 335)  \nThus, in outline, a generalization scheme in physics is presented as\nfollows: From the phenomenon we move by physical induction to the\nexperimental result and, thanks to differential equations, to the laws\nand the general hypotheses which, by a common decision of the\nscientific community, can be elevated finally to a principle.\nCertainly this is only a general scheme and the concrete process of a\ngeneralization could include many variations. The difference between\nthe geometric axiom as a “disguised definition” and the\nphysical law as a principle seems to define Poincaré’s\nepistemological criterion that distinguishes geometry from mechanics\nfrom the ontological point of view. In geometry, the convenient\nconventions (or definitions) are chosen as a function of objects\n(solid bodies, rays) which are not the objects of the geometry.\nFurthermore, in geometry we presuppose the category of group, so\ngeometry requires a double conventional abstraction. In mechanics, the\nconventions are useful and apply to physical objects (Poincaré\n1902: 152; 2017: 100). In this context we presuppose the categories of\nempirical or physical induction and of differential equations as\nnecessary preconditions for doing science. Poincaré’s\napproach therefore integrates specifically Kantian elements, the idea\nthat there are preconditions, while still completely eliminating the\ntranscendental basis of these components that we find in Kant’s\nthought.  \nPoincaré’s argument in favor of the necessary\ntransmission of the conventional character of geometry to physics is\nbased on an analogy, which shows another important relationship\nbetween geometry and physics. The methodological function of\ntransformation groups with respect to the representative space\ncorresponds to the function of geometry with respect to physics. The\nanalogy runs as follows: Just as the law of displacements may\ncorrespond only approximately to the law of groups and is consequently\nconsidered to be the result of two component changes, the first being\na displacement, and the second a qualitative alteration, so\nPoincaré regards the physical “complex” relation\nbetween two bodies \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) as the result of two\ncomponents. The first is regarded as a “simple”\ngeometrical principle, while the second is itself composed of two\n“epistemological laws.” The bodies \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\nare related to figures \\(A'\\); and \\(B'\\) of the\ngeometrical space so that \n\\(R'\\) being a “properly” geometrical\nproposition, and the \\(r_i\\) expressing the\nrelationships between objects of the representative space and the\ngeometrical space, such as the relation between solid bodies and\nmotion invariants. Poincaré declares that by changing the\nrelations \\(r_i\\), the geometrical proposition\n\\(R'(A', B')\\) could even serve to\ndescribe the relationship between two different physical bodies (see\nPoincaré 1905b: 166–67; 1913b: 336). Poincaré\nthereby rules out any application of geometry to physics based on a\nstructural isomorphism with a presupposed reality (Mette 1986:\n75–80).  \nThe conventional elements in physical theories were often\nmisunderstood by Poincaré’s contemporaries. So, for\nexample, his affirmation that neither of the two propositions\n‘The earth turns round’ and ‘The earth does not turn\nround’ is “more true than the other in the kinematic\nsense,” is not a rehabilitation of Ptolemy’s system, but\nthe consequence of the fact that in physics, the empirical systematic\n(not epistemic) under-determination of theories is limited by unifying\nconsiderations: “A physical theory is by so much the more true,\nas it puts in evidence more true relations.” So, the ‘The\nearth turns round’ has a richer content expressed by the\n“flattening of the earth, the rotation of Foucault’s\npendulum, the gyration of cyclones, the trade-winds, and who knows\nwhat else?” (Poincaré 1905b: 184–85; 1913b: 353).\nHowever, in physics proper—that is, in optics and in\nelectrodynamics—the conventional elements seem to be further\nweakened: \nWe come across a different kind of hypothesis and fully perceive its\nproductivity. Undoubtedly, the theories seem at first sight fragile\nand the history of science shows us how fleeting they are. However,\nthey do not entirely die out and something remains of each of them. It\nis this something that we must try to sort out, for there and only\nthere is true reality (Poincaré 1902: 26; 2017:\n3–30). \nIn fact, Poincaré’s model of explanation, founded on a\nminimum of well-confirmed hypotheses erected into principles and from\nwhich any meaningful propositions can be deduced, is called into\nquestion by Maxwell’s approach. In view of the crisis in physics\nthat was brewing toward the end of the 19th century,\nPoincaré’s general position will not work without posing\nproblems with respect to concrete principles. We will briefly mention\nthe most interesting case, that of the application of the principle of\nrelativity to electrodynamics, which is one of the most discussed\nsubjects by historians (e.g., Goldberg 1967; Paty 1993; Miller 1996a;\nZahar 2001; Darrigol 2004; Rouché 2008; Walter 2011, DiSalle\n2014)—not least because Poincaré and Einstein did not\ncite each other on relativity despite the fact that Einstein read\nPoincaré’s Science and Hypothesis before 1905\nand Poincaré wrote Einstein a recommendation letter sometime\nafter their only meeting at the first Solvay Congress in 1911 (Walter\n2007: chap. 59.3). What is uncontroversial is that Poincaré\ndiscovered salient points of the special theory of relativity, such as\nan operational definition of clock-synchronization to the first order\nin \\(v/c\\), and a relativistic formula of the composition of\nspeed, the determination of the structure of the Lorentz-group. \nSince the Maxwell-Lorentz equations for electromagnetics are not\nGalileo-covariant, the classical principle of relativity according to\nwhich measurement in one inertial reference frame can be converted to\nanother by Galilean transformation is called into question. Using in\nhis famous St. Louis lecture of 1904 the designation (physical)\n“principle of relativity” (Poincaré 1905a: 607),\nwhich does not apply “to finite equations that are directly\nobserved, but to differential equations” (Poincaré 1913a:\n103; 1963: 19), Poincaré reports that Lorentz introduces the\nconjectures (i.e., the ad hoc hypotheses) of “local\ntime” and of “uniform contraction in the direction of\nmotion” in an attempt to save the principle in its application\nto the electromagnetic domain (see Poincaré 1905b: 132 ff.;\n1913b: 305 ff.). It was indeed Poincaré (1906) who made\nLorentz’s theory fully compatible with the relativity principle.\nWe are thus naturally inclined, remarks Poincaré, to admit the\npostulate of relativity in every domain. In postulating the principle\nas a “general law of Nature” (Poincaré 1906: 495),\nits extended form finds its origin in the Galilean principle, and its\nmotivation in its compatibility with a theory explaining why no\nexperiment is able to inform us of the earth’s motion relative\nto the ether. So, the principle is an element of a work in progress\ncontaining several conjectures and there is the possibility that it\nwill lose its soundness (Poincaré 1905b: 146; 1913b: 319). \nIn fact, there are now two principles: the old one, which was made\nimmune to revision by considering it as a conventional\nprinciple and which serves to construct geometrical space via the\ntransformation group that is the mathematical expression of the\npsychological principle of the free mobility of “rigid”\nbodies, and the new one, where the invariance concerns differential\nequations and where the geometry could now be rooted in the Lorentz\ngroup at the price of accepting a four-dimensional spacetime with\nindefinite metric (see Gray 2012: 111; Walter 2009). So, it seems that\nPoincaré’s old conventional construction of space where\nhe prefers Euclidean geometry on the basis of considerations of\nsimplicity and commodity must be subsumed to a new convention on\nspace-time. Indeed, Poincaré never abandons Galilean spacetime\nbut it is not even clear if before 1912 the principle of special\nrelativity with Lorentz covariance (instead of with Galilean\ncovariance) was confirmed well enough to be unassailable by experiment\nand to make the principle with Galilean covariance unfruitful (Walter\n2009). This situation is what Larry Sklar has called\n“transient” underdetermination,  \nthat is, theories which are not empirically equivalent but\nare equally (or at least reasonably) well confirmed by all the\nevidence we happen to have in hand at the moment (see Stanford 2009\nand Sklar 1975: 380)  \nwhile waiting to make a decision in face of new results. \nThere is no doubt that Poincaré’s work has been very\ninfluential both in the sciences and in philosophy. His geometric\nconventionalism was widely discussed at the time it was first\npresented and also greatly influenced the logical empiricists, who\nwere linked to Poincaré’s follower Louis Rougier (Rougier\n1920), one of the organizers of the 1935 Paris congress on scientific\nphilosophy. Poincaré’s conventionalism was widely\ndiscussed again in the post-WWII literature on spacetime and\nrelativity theory in the philosophy of science. His intervention in\nthe philosophy of mathematics has been a source of great inspiration\nto critics of logicism and others. In the tradition of Kant and Mach,\nwho excluded “metaphysical” speculations from philosophy\nof science, Poincaré is also considered to be one of the\nfounders of this field as a discipline (Brenner 2003; Moulines 2006).\nPoincaré is considered the founder of structural realism and is\nthought to have held a productive middle of the road position on\nscientific realism (Worrall 1989). His discussion of scientific\ncreativity has spawned a literature of its own and became a standard\naccount of how scientific creativity works. His work on the stability\nof the solar system influenced the development of chaos theory and the\nclassical concept of causality based on the fact that similar causes\nproduce similar effects. Poincaré is one of the starting points\nfor arguments showing the compatibility of ontological determinism and\nepistemological indeterminism. His famous recurrence theorem raised\nquestions for statistical mechanics and his work on probability theory\ninfluenced the early work of Hans Reichenbach (Glymour and Eberhardt\n2012).  \nInsofar as Poincaré’s philosophical views focus on the\ncomprehension and explanation of the activities and practice of\nmathematicians and scientists, his approach seems more current today\nthan the approach of the logical empiricists, given that the\ncontemporary “practical turn” in the philosophy of science\npays less tribute to logic and the foundations of mathematics by\nformal representation than did the canonical tradition of the 20th\ncentury philosophy of science. His approach restores the depth to some\nof the critical discussions that the Vienna Circle undertook in the\nspirit of Poincaré from the 1930s onward (Heinzmann 2016).\nThough they are missing from standard histories in philosophy of\nscience, the Swiss philosopher Ferdinand Gonseth, the French\nphilosophers Jean Cavaillès and Albert Lautman, the Italian\nepistemologist Federico Enriques and, finally, Jean Piaget, all have\nin common a focus on mathematical practice that rejects the logical\nempiricists’ strict distinction of analytic and synthetic\npropositions. \nPoincaré is often invoked in the philosophy of mathematics\nbecause of his discussions of the paradoxes and his diagnosis, which\nbecame the vicious circle principle. According to\nPoincaré’s pragmatic and anti-Platonist standpoint,\nmathematical definitions and proof-procedures should be limited to\npredicative ones. Herman Weyl (1918) was the first to propose a\npredicative continuum, while later Lorenzen (1955, 1965) and,\nespecially, Kreisel (1960) and Feferman (1964) each tried to find\npredicatively definable sets following Poincaré’s rough\nsketch. Hintikka (2012) argues that logicians and mathematicians did\nnot know how to implement Poincaré’s insight because they\ndid not pay enough attention to the quantifier dependence and\nindependence and proposes a solution with IF-logic.\nPoincaré’s critical remarks about the logicist project\nand about the new logic in general have been evaluated many times and\ncontinue to be discussed in the literature and to inspire those with\nsympathy towards intuitionistic or Kantian points of view (Cassirer\n1910; Dingler 1931; Folina 1992; Goldfarb 1988; Heinzmann 1995).\nAlthough the influences on Wittgenstein’s work are notoriously\ndifficult to interpret, there are clearly evident similarities to\nPoincaré’s fundamental views (Rodych 2011). \nMoritz Schlick is mainly responsible for bringing an interpretation of\nPoincaré’s conventionalism to the Logical Empiricists. In\nparticular, he advocated Poincaré’s conventionalism (or\nat least what he thought of as Poincaré’s\nconventionalism) in letters to Hans Reichenbach in regards to\nReichenbach’s 1920 book The Theory of Relativity and A\nPriori Knowledge (Coffa 1991, Parrini 1998, Friedman 1999;\nOberdan 2009). Later, however, Schlick criticized generalized\nconventionalism in his reprinted and widely-read article of 1935\n“Are Natural Laws Conventions?” Reichenbach took up\ngeometric conventionalism in his Philosophy of Space and Time\n(1928) and Carnap generalized conventions, taking them to be the\nadoption of a formal language of science. Poincaré was widely\ncited and discussed in the heyday of the Logical Empiricists, though\nthe meaning of his conventionalism is often distorted, for example,\nwhen Popper characterizes Poincaré’s conventions as\nanalytic judgments (Popper 2007: chap. VIII). Einstein’s\ninterpretation of Poincaré in his important article\n“Geometry and Experience” is emblematic of the fate of his\ngeometric conventionalism in the philosophical literature. Einstein\nsays there that although current physics (i.e., the General Theory of\nRelativity) is not in accord with Poincaré’s views, he is\ncorrect “sub specie aeterni,” that is in\nprinciple in an ideal physics (Einstein 1921). Thus the specific\ngeometric conventionalism that Poincaré advocated was opposed,\nbut a generalized form of conventionalism was frequently embraced.\n \nAlthough Poincaré’s ideas are not the central focus of\nthe discussion of spacetime theories that blossomed in the 1960s and\n1970s, his views are always in the background. Adolf Grünbaum\n(1968) defended geometric conventionalism, albeit with his own unique\narguments rather than Poincaré’s, and critics of\nGrünbaum and of conventionalism generally could not help but\ndirect some of their attention to Poincaré who was rightly seen\nas the preeminent precursor to all further work on geometric\nconventionalism. Some of this literature does directly engage with\nPoincaré, notably Torretti (1978).  \nIn 1989 John Worrall published a paper defending structural realism as\n“the best of both worlds” in the debate over scientific\nrealism, drawing his inspiration from Poincaré. The view came\nto be widely discussed in the philosophy of science and spawned\nfurther elaborations and differentiations into different types, such\nas ontic and epistemic structural realism (Worrall 1989; Ladyman\n2009). Poincaré’s epistemological thesis that all\nstatements depend, at least partially, on a conventional conceptual\nframework is generalized in Kasimir Ajdukiewicz’s radical\nconventionalism (Ajdukiewicz 1978) and is related to the Quinean\nnotion that there are logically incompatible but empirically\nequivalent theories (Quine 1990: chap. 41). (See Poincaré\n1905b: chap. X.3, which is embedded in the discussion about nominalism\nwith his former pupil Édouard Le Roy for the limits that\nPoincaré places on these ideas.) \nPoincaré also spawned a large literature on scientific\ncreativity with his brief account of his discovery while stepping onto\nan omnibus during an outing of the relation between Fuchsian (or\nautomorphic) functions and non-Euclidean geometries:  \nAt the moment when I put my foot on the step the idea came to me,\nwithout anything in my former thoughts seeming to have paved the way\nfor it, that the transformation that I had used to define the Fuchsian\nfunctions were identical with those of non-Euclidean geometry. (1908:\n49; 1913b: 387–388)  \nThe story has been very widely cited and his four-step account of how\none arrives at novel ideas has been adopted by those presenting the\ndevelopment of creative ideas in analogy with Darwinian blind\nvariation, such as Donald Campbell (1987 [1960]: 99–100) and\nDean K. Simonton (1988: 27–33; 1995: 468–86; 1999:\n32–4); see Kronfeldner for a critical survey of the literature\n(2011: esp. 64–65). Poincaré’s creativity has also\nbeen analyzed and compared to that of other scientists, especially\nEinstein, by Arthur Miller (1984, 1992, 1996b, 1997).  \nPoincaré’s writings influenced artists (Henderson 1983),\nespecially the cubist movement which associated their artistic\napproach to that occupied by non-Euclidean geometries in the history\nof geometry. In “the mathematician of Cubism” Maurice\nPrincet closely studied the work of Poincaré (Décimo\n2006) and how he influenced Picasso among others, and Albert Gleizes\nand Jean Metzinger (1912), the authors of the famous treatise\n“Du Cubisme” that provides theory to the artistic\nmovement. Poincaré’s work combines the sensations\nproduced by movement with the sense of touch (as in Science and\nHypothesis) to create the fourth dimension. Maurits Cornelis\nEscher uses a paving motif of the Poincaré disk of the\nhyperbolic plane in order to represent an infinite structure in a\nfinite space (see Dunham 2010 (Other Internet Resources), Figure 3, p.\n3).
