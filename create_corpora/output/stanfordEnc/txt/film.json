Although philosophers were among the\nfirst academics to publish studies of the new artform in the early\ndecades of the twentieth century, the field did not experience\nsignificant growth until the 1980's when a renaissance occurred. There\nare many reasons for the field's recent growth. Suffice it to say here\nthat changes in both academic philosophy and the cultural role of the\nmovies in general made it imperative for philosophers to take film\nseriously as an artform on a par with the more traditional ones like\ntheater, dance, and painting. As a result of this surge in interest in\nfilm as a subject for philosophical reflection, the philosophy of film\nhas become an important area of research in aesthetics.\n\n\n\nThis entry is organized around a number of issues that are central to\nthe philosophy of film. They explore different aspect of film as an\nartistic medium, illustrating the range of concerns addressed within\nthe philosophy of film.\n\n\n\nThere are two features of the philosophy of film that need to be\ndiscussed before delving into more specific issues. The first is that\nfilm scholars who are not professional philosophers have made many\ncontributions to the field. (See, for example, Chatman (1990)\nand Smith (1995).) This differentiates this area from many other\nphilosophical disciplines. While physicists often write about the\nphilosophy of science, the academic discipline of the philosophy of\nphysics is dominated by professional philosophers.  Not so in the\nphilosophy of film. As a result, my use of the term “philosopher\nof film” will be broad, intended to include all of those\ninterested in theoretical issues about the cinema. \n\nThe second peculiarity is that within film studies—itself an\ninstitutionalized area of academic study—there is a sub-field\nof film theory that has significant overlap with the\nphilosophy of film even though the majority of its practitioners\noperate on significantly different philosophical assumptions than\nAnglo-American philosophers of film. In the balance of this entry, I\nshall include both of these areas under the rubric of the philosophy\nof film, although my primary emphasis is on the contributions of\nAnglo-American theorists and I will occasionally distinguish this\nfield from film theory as practiced within the area of film\nstudies. One of the characteristics of philosophy as a discipline is\nits questioning of its own nature and basis. The philosophy of film\nshares this characteristic with the field in general. Indeed, a first\nissue that the philosophy of film must address is the grounds for its\nown existence. This involves not only the question of what the field\nshould look like, but also that of whether it has any reason to exist\nat all.  \n\nIs there any need for a separate philosophic discipline devoted to\nfilm in addition to more empirical studies of film undertaken under\nthe aegis of film studies itself?  Although this question has not\nalways received the attention it deserves from philosophers, it is\nactually a pressing one, for it asks philosophers to justify their\nnewly found interest in film as more than an opportunistic\nincorporation of a highly popular form of popular culture into their\ndomain. \n\nIn one sense, however, philosophers need not justify their interest in\nfilm, for philosophical aesthetics has always had a concern not just\nwith art in general but with specific art forms. Beginning with\nAristotle's Poetics—a work devoted to explaining the\nnature of Greek tragedy—philosophers have sought to explain\nthe specific characteristics of each significant art form of their\nculture. From this point of view, there is no more reason to question\nthe existence of a philosophy of film than there is that of a\nphilosophy of music or a philosophy of painting, two fields that are\nwell accepted as components of aesthetics. Since film is a\nsignificant artform in our contemporary world, philosophy might even\nbe judged to have a responsibility to investigate its nature. \n\nStill, there are some reasons why it might seem problematic for there\nto be a separate academic field of the philosophy of film.  Because\nthe study of film is already institutionalized within academia in the\ndiscipline of film studies, and because that field includes a separate\nsub-field of film theory, it might seem that, unlike literature and\nmusic, say, film is already well-served by this institutional\nbase. From this point of view, the philosophy of film is redundant,\noccupying a space that has already been carved out by an alternative\ndiscipline. \n\nThe problem is that the sub-field of film theory within film studies\nhas been dominated by a range of theoretical commitments that many\nAnglo-American philosophers do not share. Many such philosophers have\ntherefore felt a need not just to make minor revisions in the field\nand its understanding of film but rather to make a new beginning in\nthe study of film that does not share the problematic assumptions of\nfilm theory itself. For this reason, as well as the earlier-cited view\nof film as a legitimate topic within aesthetics, they have felt it\nimportant to develop a philosophically informed mode of thinking about\nfilm. \n\nBut once the philosophy of film is granted autonomy as a separate\nsub-field of aesthetics, the question arises as to its form. That is,\nphilosophers are concerned with the issue of how the philosophy of\nfilm should be constituted as a field of study. What role is there for\nfilm interpretation in the field?  How do studies of particular films\nrelate to more theoretical studies of the medium as such?  And what\nabout philosophy in film, a popular mode of philosophic\nthinking about film?  Is there a unified model that can be employed to\ncharacterize this newly vitalized domain of philosophic inquiry? \n\nAn increasingly popular way of thinking about the philosophy of film\nis to model it on scientific theorizing. Although there is\ndisagreement on the precise details of such a proposal, its adherents\nurge that the study of film be treated as a scientific discipline with\nan appropriate relationship between theory and evidence. For some,\nthis means having an empirical body of film interpretations that gives\nrise to wider theoretical generalizations. For others, it means\ndeveloping a set of small scale theories that attempt to explain\ndifferent aspect of films and our experience of them. The emphasis\nhere is on developing models or theories of various\nfeatures of films. \n\nThis idea of modeling the discipline of the philosophy of film on the\nnatural sciences has been prominent among cognitive film\ntheorists (Bordwell and Carroll 1996; Currie 1995). This rapidly\ndeveloping approach emphasizes viewers' conscious processing of films,\nas opposed to the emphasis within traditional film theory on\nunconscious processes. In general, these theorists lean towards seeing\nthe study of film as a scientific undertaking. \n\nThe idea that the philosophy of film should model itself upon a\nscientific model has been contested from a variety of points of\nview. Some philosophers, relying on the writings of pragmatists like\nWilliam James, have questioned the idea that natural science provides\na useful way to think about what philosophers are doing in their\nreflections on film. Here, there is an emphasis on the particularity\nof films as works of art in contrast the to the urge to move to a\ngeneral theory of film. Others, making use of later Wittgenstein as\nwell as the tradition of hermeneutics, also question such a natural\nscientific orientation for philosophic reflections on film. This camp\nsees the study of film as a humanistic discipline that is\nmisunderstood when it is assimilated to a natural science. \n\nThe debates about what the philosophy of film should look like are\nreally just being joined. This is because it is only recently that a\nscientific conception of the philosophy of film has emerged as a\ncompetitor. But despite the increasing popularity of a cognitive\napproach to film, there are fundamental issues about the structure of\nthe philosophy of film that remain to be settled. \n\nOne fundamental issue is what mediums are to be included under the\nterm \"film.\"  Although \"film\" initially referred to the celluloid\nstock on which movies were recorded, restricting the term to just\ncelluloid-based works would be unduly restrictive.  After all, many of\nthe films we watch today are either recorded digitally or projected\ndigitally or both.  Such works are clearly part of the same art form\nas celluloid-based films, so the referent of the term \"film\" has to be\ntaken to include works made on both mediums. \n\nAnd then is television.  Although many film scholars and philosophers\nof film has a disparaging view of television, the emergence of such\nshows as The Sopranos and The Wire established\ntelevision as a medium for making valuable works of art.  As a result,\nit makes sense to include such shows under the rubric of films. \n\nThis stretching of the concept \"film\" to include both non-celluloid\nmovies and television and other related mediums has led some\nphilosophers of film to suggest replacing the term \"film\" with a\nbroader category, such as moving picture or moving image.  So far,\nsuch suggestions have not yet changed the way in which the field is\ndesignated, so I retain the term \"philosophy of film\" throughout this\nentry. \n\nThe question that dominated early philosophical inquiry into film was\nwhether the cinema—a term that emphasizes the institutional\nstructure within which films were produced, distributed, and\nviewed—could be regarded as an artform.  There were two reasons\nwhy cinema did not seem worthy of the honorific designation of an\nart. The first was that early contexts for the exhibition of films\nincluded such venues as the vaudeville peep show and the circus side\nshow. As a popular cultural form, film seemed to have a vulgarity that\nmade it an unsuitable companion to theater, painting, opera, and the\nother fine arts. A second problem was that film seemed to borrow too\nmuch from other art forms. To many, early films seemed little more\nthan recordings of either theatrical performances or everyday\nlife. The rationale for the former was that they could be disseminated\nto a wider audience than that which could see a live performance. But\nfilm then only seems to be a means of access to art and not an\nindependent art form on its own. The latter, on the other hand, seemed\ntoo direct a reproduction of life to qualify as art, for there seemed\nlittle mediation by any guiding consciousness. \n\nIn order to justify the claim that film deserves to be considered an\nindependent art form, philosophers investigated the ontological\nstructure of film. The hope was to develop a conception of film that\nmade it clear that it differed in significant ways from the other fine\narts. For this reason, the question of film's nature was a crucial one\nfor theorists of film during what we might call the classic\nperiod. \n\nHugo Münsterberg, the first philosopher to write a monograph\nabout the new art form, sought to distinguish film by means of the\ntechnical devices that it employed in presenting its\nnarratives (Münsterberg 1916). Flashbacks, close-ups,\nand edits are some examples of the technical means that filmmakers\nemploy to present their narratives that theater lacks. For\nMünsterberg, the use of these devices distinguished film from the\ntheater as an artform. \n\nMünsterberg went on to ask how viewers are able to understand the\nrole that these technical devices play in the articulation of\ncinematic narratives. His answer is that these devices are all\nobjectifications of mental processes. A close-up, for example,\npresents in visual form a correlate to the mental act of paying\nattention to something. Viewers naturally understand how such\ncinematic devices function because they are familiar with the workings\nof their own minds and can recognize these objectified mental\nfunctions when they see them. Although this aspect of\nMünsterberg's theory links him to contemporary cognitive\nphilosophers of film, he does not explain how viewers know that what\nthey are looking at are objectified mental functions. \n\nMünsterberg was writing during the silent era.  The development\nof the simultaneous sound track—the\n“talkie”—changed film forever. It is not surprising\nthat this important innovation spawned interesting theoretical\nreflections. \n\nThe well-known psychologist of art, Rudolph Arnheim, made the\nsurprising claim that the talkie represented a decline from the\nhighpoint of silent cinema. (Arnheim 1957) Relying on the idea\nthat, in order to be a unique artform, film had to be true to its own\nspecific medium, Arnheim denigrates the sound film as a mixture of two\ndistinct artistic media that do not constitute a satisfying whole. \n\nFor Arnheim, the silent film had achieved artistic status by focusing\non its ability to present moving bodies. Indeed, for him, the artistic\naspect of cinema consisted in its ability to present abstractions, an\nability completely lost when films began to employ simultaneous\nsoundtracks. Writing near the dawn of the talkie, Arnheim could only\nsee what we now recognize as a natural development of the artform as a\ndecline from a previously attained height. \n\nAndré Bazin, though not a professional philosopher or even an\nacademic, countered Arnheim's assessment in a series of articles that\nstill exert an important influence on the field. (Bazin 1967;\n1971) For Bazin, the important dichotomy is not that between the sound\nand the silent film but rather between films that focus on the image\nand those that emphasize reality. Although editing had emerged for\nmany such as Sergei Eisenstein as the distinctive aspect of film,\nBazin returns to the silent era to demonstrate the presence of an\nalternative means of achieving film art, namely an interest in\nallowing the camera to reveal the actual nature of the world. Relying\non a conception of film as having a realist character because of its\nbasis in photography, Bazin argues that the future of cinema as an\nartform depends on its development of this capacity to present the\nworld to us “frozen in time.” \n\nIn making his argument, Bazin valorizes the film style he dubs\nrealism, characterized by extended shots and deep focus. Jean Renoir,\nOrson Welles, and the Italian neo-Realists are the filmmakers whom\nBazin sees as culminating this imagist tradition of filmmaking that\nhas realized the true potential of the medium. \n\nIn his pathbreaking study of what he called “classical film\ntheory,” Noël Carroll (1988) argued that there were many illicit\npresuppositions at play in the classical theorists' attempts to define\nfilm's nature. In particular, he accused them of confusing particular\nstyles of filmmaking with more abstract claims about the nature of the\nmedium itself. His accusations seemed to spell the end of such\nattempts to justify film styles by their grounding in the medium's\nnature. Recently, however, Bazin's claim about film's realism has received\nnew life, albeit without the extravagances of Bazin's own writing.\nKendall Walton, in an extremely influential paper (1984), argued that\nfilm, because of its basis in photography, was a realistic medium that\nallowed viewers to actually see the objects that appear on screen.\nThe transparency thesis has been the subject of a great deal\nof debate among philosophers and aestheticians.  Gregory Currie, for\nexample, rejects the transparency thesis while still defending a form\nof realism.  He argues that film's realism is the result of the fact\nthat objects depicted on screen trigger the same recognitional\ncapacities that are used to identify real objects.   The discussion of the realist character of film continues to be a\ntopic of heated debate among philosophers of film.  Most recently,\nthe emergence of digital technologies for\nfashioning the image raise very basic questions about the plausibility\nof this view. \n\nFilms are the product of many individuals working together.  This is\napparent when one watches the credits at the end of any recent\nHollywood film and sees the myriad names that come scrolling by.  To\ncoin a phrase, it takes a village to make a movie. \n\nIt might therefore seem surprising that there is a significant\ntendency among film scholars to treat films as the product of a single\nindividual, its auteur or author. On this line of\ninterpretation, the director of the film is the creative intelligence\nwho shapes the entire film in a manner parallel to how we think of,\nsay, literary works being authored. \n\nThe idea of the director as auteur was first suggested by\nFrancois Truffaut—later to become one of the central directors\nin the French New Wave. Truffaut used the term polemically to\ndenigrate the then dominant mode of filmmaking that emphasized the\nadaptation of great works of literature to the screen. In the attempt\nto valorize a different style of filmmaking, Truffaut argued that the\nonly films that deserved to be designated art were those in which the\ndirector had complete control over its production by writing the\nscreenplay as well as actually directing the actors. Only films made\nin this way deserved to be given the status of works of art. \n\nThe well-known American film scholar and reviewer, Andrew Sarris,\nadopted Truffaut's theory in order to legitimate film studies as an\nacademic discipline. For Sarris, the auteur theory was a\ntheory of film evaluation, for it suggested to him that the works of\ngreat directors were the only significant ones. In his somewhat\nidiosyncratic use of the idea, he even argued that the flawed works of\nmajor directors were artistically better than masterpieces made by\nminor ones. A more defensible aspect of his ideas was the emphasis on\nthe entire ouvre of a director. Within film studies, the\nemphasis on synoptic studies of individual directors is derived from\nSarris' version of the auteur theory. \n\nA negative consequence of the influence of auterism is the\nrelative neglect of other important contributors to the making of a\nfilm. Actors, cinematographers, screenwriters, composers, and art\ndirectors all make significant contributions to films that the\nauteur theory underestimates. While Truffaut introduced the\nterm polemically to support a new style of filmmaking, subsequent\ntheorists have tended to ignore the context of his remarks. \n\nAs a general theory of the cinema, then, the auteur theory is\nclearly flawed. Not all films—not even all great ones—can\nbe attributed to the control of the director. Actors are the clearest\nexamples of individuals who may have such a significant impact on the\nmaking of a specific film that the film has to be seen as attributable\nto them even more importantly than the director. Although films like\nTruffaut's own may be (mostly) the product of his authoring, a Clint\nEastwood film owes a great deal of its success to that actor's\npresence. It is a mistake to treat all films as if they were simply\nthe product of one crucial individual, the director.  Still, old\nhabits die slowly, and films are still referenced by means of their\ndirectors. \n\nA more general criticism of the auteur theory is its emphasis\non individuals. Most of the great directors studied by film theorists\nworked within well-defined institutional settings, the most famous of\nwhich is Hollywood. To attempt to understand films without placing\nthem within their broader context of production has been seen as a\nreal shortcoming of the theory. \n\nThis sort of criticism of auterism has received a more\ntheoretical formulation within postmodernism, with its famous (or\ninfamous) declaration of the death of the author. What this\nself-consciously rhetorical gesture asserts is that works of art,\nincluding films, should not be seen as the product of a single\ncontrolling intelligence, but have to seen as products of their times\nand social contexts. The goal of the critic should not be to\nreconstruct the intentions of the author but to display the various\ndifferent contexts that explain the production of the work as well as\nits limitations. \n\nWhile the general institutional context is certainly crucial for\nunderstanding a film, the auteur theory does nonetheless\nprovide a useful focus for some efforts in the scholarly\nstudy of film: an exploration of the work of individual directors. But\neven here, there has been worry that the theory overemphasizes the\ncontribution of the director at the expense of other\npeople—actors, directors of photography,\nscreenwriters—whose contributions may be equally important to\nthe making of at least some films. \n\nPhilosophic discussion of viewer involvement with films starts out\nwith a puzzle that has been raised about many artforms: Why should we\ncare what happens to fictional characters?  After all, since they are\nfictional, their fates shouldn't matter to us in the way that the\nfates of real people do. But, of course, we do get involved in the\ndestinies of these imaginary beings. The question is why.  Because so\nmany films that attract our interest are fictional, this question is\nan important one for philosophers of film to answer.  \n\nOne answer, common in the film theory tradition, is that the reason\nthat we care about what happens to some fictional characters is\nbecause we identify with them. Although or, perhaps, because\nthese characters are highly idealized—they are more beautiful,\nbrave, resourceful, etc. than any actual human being could\nbe—viewers identify with them, thereby also taking themselves to\nbe correlates of these ideal beings. But once we see the characters as\nversions of ourselves, their fates matter to us, for we see ourselves\nas wrapped up in their stories. In the hands of feminist theorists,\nthis idea was used to explain how films use their viewers' pleasures\nto support a sexist society. Male viewers of film, it was held,\nidentify with their idealized screen counterparts and enjoy the\nobjectification of women through both screen images that they view\nwith pleasure and also narratives in which the male characters with\nwhom they identify come to possess the sought after female\ncharacter. \n\nPhilosophers of film have argued that identification is too crude a\ntool to use to explain our emotional engagement with characters, for\nthere is a wide variety of attitudes that we take to the fictional\ncharacters we see projected on the screen. (See, for example, Smith\n(1995).) And even if we did identify with some characters, this would\nnot explain why we had any emotional reactions to characters with whom\nwe did not identify.  Clearly, a more general account of viewer\ninvolvement with cinematic characters and the films in which they\nappear is required. \n\nThe general outline of the answer philosophers of film have provided\nto the question of our emotional involvement with films is that we\ncare about what happens in films because films get us to imagine\nthings taking place, things that we do care about. Because how we\nimagine things working out does affect our emotions, fiction films\nhave an emotional impact upon us. \n\nThere are two basic accounts that philosophers have put forward to\nexplain the effects that the imagination has upon us.  Simulation\ntheory employs a computer analogy, saying that imagining\nsomething involves one having one's usual emotional response to\nsituations and people, only the emotions are running\noff-line. What this means is that, when I have an emotional\nresponse like anger to an imagined situation, I feel the same emotion\nthat I would normally feel only I am not inclined to act on this\nemotion, say, by yelling or responding in an angry way, as I would be\nif the emotion was a full-fledged emotion.  \n\nWhat this explains, then, is a seemingly paradoxical feature of our\nfilm-going experience: that we seem to enjoy watching things on the\nscreen that we would hate seeing in real life. The most obvious\ncontext for this is horror films, for we may enjoy seeing horrific\nevents and beings that we would strongly desire not to witness in real\nlife. The last thing I would want to see more of in real life is a\nrampaging giant ape, yet I am fascinated to watch its screen\nexpoits. The simulation theorist says that the reason for this is\nthat, when we experience an emotion off-line that would be distressing\nin real life, we may actually enjoy having that emotion in the safety\nof the off-line situation. \n\nOne problem facing the simulation theorist is explaining what it means\nfor an emotion to be off-line. While this is an intriguing metaphor,\nit is not clear that the simulation theorist can provide an adequate\naccount of how we are to cash it out. \n\nAn alternative account of our emotional response to imagined scenarios\nhas been dubbed the thought theory. The idea here is that we\ncan have emotional responses to mere thoughts.  When I am told that a\njunior colleague of mine was unjustly denied reappointment, the\nthought of this injustice is sufficient to make me experience\nanger. Similarly, when I imagine such a scenario in relation to\nsomeone, the mere thought of them being treated in this way can\noccasion my anger. Mere thought can bring about real emotion. \n\nWhat the thought theory claims about our emotional response to films\nis that our emotions are brought about by the thoughts that occur to\nus as we are watching a film. When we see the dastardly villain tying\nthe innocent heroine to the tracks, we are both concerned and outraged\nby the very thought that he is acting in this way and that she is\ntherefore in danger. Yet all the time we are aware that this is a\nmerely fictional situation, so there is no temptation to yield to a\ndesire to save her. We are always aware that no one is really in\ndanger. As a result, there is no need, says the thought theorist, for\nthe complexities of simulation theory in order to explain why we are\nmoved by the movies. \n\nThere are some problems with thought theory as well. Why should a mere\nthought, as opposed to a belief, be something that occasions an\nemotional response from us?  If I believe that you were wronged,\nthat's one thing. But the thought of your being wronged is\nanother. Since we can't have full-fledged beliefs about the fictional\ncharacters in films, the thought theory needs to explain why we are so\nmoved by their fates. (See Plantinga and Smith (1999) for more\ndiscussion of this issue.) Fiction films tell stories.  Unlike literary media such as\nnovels, they do so with images and sound—including both\nwords and music.  Clearly, some films have narrators.  These\nnarrators are generally character narrators, narrators who are\ncharacters within the fictional world of the film.  They tell us\nthe film's stories and, supposedly, show us the images that we see.\n Sometimes, however, a voice-over narration presents us with an\napparently objective view of the situation of the characters, as if it\noriginated from outside of the film world.  In addition, there are\nfiction films, films that tell stories, in which there is no clear\nagent who is doing the telling. These facts have given rise to a number\nof puzzles about film narration that have been discussed by\nphilosophers of film. (See Chatman (1990) and Gaut (2004).) One central issue that has been a subject of controversy among\nphilosophers is unreliable narration.  There are films in which the\naudience comes to see that the character narrator of the film has a\nlimited or misguided view of the film world.  One example is Max\nOphuls' Letter from an Unknown Woman (1948), a film that has\nbeen discussed by a number of different philosophers.  The majority of\nthe film is a voice-over narration by Lisa Berndle, the unknown woman\nof the film's title, who recites the words of the letter she sends to\nher lover, Max Brand, shortly before her death.  The audience comes to\nsee that Lisa has a distorted view of the events she narrates, most\nclearly in her misestimation of the character of Brand.  This raises\nthe question of how the audience can come to know that Lisa's view is\ndistorted, since what we hear and see is narrated (or shown) by her.\nGeorge Wilson (1986) has argued that unreliable narratives such as\nthis require the positing of an implicit narrator of the film, while\nGregory Currie (1995) has argued that an implied filmmaker suffices.\nThis question has become very relevant with the increased popularity\nof filmmaking styles involving unreliable narration.  Bryan\nSinger's The Usual Suspects (1995) touched off a flurry of\nfilms whose narrators were unreliable in one way or another. A\nrelated issue concerning narrative that has been a\nfocus of debate is whether all films have narrators,\nincluding those without explicit ones.  Initially, it was argued\nthat the idea of a narratorless narrative did not make sense, that\nnarration required an agent doing the narrating, who was the film's\nnarrator.  In\ncases where there were no explicit narrators, an implicit narrator\nneeded to be posited to make sense of how viewers gained access to the\nfictional world of the film.  Opponents responded that the\nnarrator in the sense of the agent who gave film audiences access to a\nfilm's fictional world could be the filmmaker(s), so there was no need\nto posit such a dubious entity as an implicit narrator of a film. \n\nThere is, however, an even deeper problem in regard to film narration\nover what has been called the “Imagined Seeing Thesis”\n(Wilson 1997).  According to this Thesis, viewers of mainstream\nfiction films imagine themselves to be looking into the world of the\nstory and seeing segments of the narrative action from a series of\ndefinite visual perspectives.  In its traditional version, viewers are\ntaken to imagine the movie screen as a kind of window that allows them\nto watch the unfolding of the story on the “other side.”\nHowever, it is hard for this view to account for what is being\nimagined when, for example, the camera moves, or there is an edit to a\nshot that incorporates a different perspective on a scene, etc.  As a\nresult, an alternative view has been suggested, namely that viewers\nimagine themselves to be seeing motion picture images that have been\nphotographically derived, in some indeterminate way, from within the\nfictional world itself.  But this position runs into problems, since\nit is normally part of the film's fiction that no camera was present\nin the fictional space of the narrative.  The resulting debate is over\nwhether to reject as incoherent the Imagined Seeing Thesis or whether\nit is possible to develop an acceptable version of this Thesis.\nPhilosophers remain sharply divided on this fundamental issue. The\ntopic of film narration thus continues to be a subject of intense\nphilosophical\ndiscussion and investigation.  Various attempts to explain its\nnature remain hotly debated.  As new and more complex styles of\nfilm narration become popular, it is likely that the subject of film\nnarration will continue to receive attention from philosophers and\naestheticians. \n\nThe best way to understand the innovations made by philosophers in our\nunderstanding of how films relate to society is to look at the view\nthat was dominant in film theory some years ago. According to that\nview, popular narrative films—especially those produced by\n“Hollywood,” a term that referred to the entertainment\nindustry located in Hollywood, California, but also included popular\nnarrative films produced on a similar model—inevitably\nsupported social oppression by denying, in one way or another, its\nexistence. Such films were taken to present nothing but fairytales\nthat used the realistic character of the medium to present those\nimaginary stories as if they were accurate pictures of reality. In\nthis way, the actual character of the social domination assumed by\nsuch a view to be rampant in contemporary society was obscured in\nfavor of a rosy picture of the realities of human social\nexistence. \n\nAs part of their argument, these film theorists have gone beyond\nexamining individual films themselves and have argued that the very\nstructure of the narrative film functions to assist in the maintenance\nof social domination. From this point of view, an overcoming of\nnarrativity itself is required for films to be genuinely\nprogressive. \n\nIn opposition to such a negative view of film's relationship to\nsociety, philosophers of film have argued that popular films need not\nsupport social domination but can even give expression to socially\ncritical attitudes. In making this argument, they have corrected film\ntheory's tendency to make broad generalizations about the relationship\nbetween film and society that are not grounded in careful analysis of\nindividual films. They have instead concentrated upon presenting detailed\ninterpretations of films that show how their narratives present\ncritical takes on various social practices and institutions. Class,\nrace, gender, and sexuality are among the different social arenas in\nwhich philosophers of film have seen films make socially conscious,\ncritical interventions in public debates. \n\nOne interesting example of films that develop political stances that\nare not merely supportive of existing modes of social domination are\nthose that involve interracial couples. So Stanley Kramer's 1967 film,\nGuess Who's Coming to Dinner, investigates the plausibility\nof racial integration as a solution to the problems of anti-black\nracism in America through its portrayal of the problems facing an\ninterracial couple. Nearly 25 years later, Spike Lee's Jungle\nFever argues against the earlier film's political agenda, once\nagain using an interracial couple that encounters racism. Only this\ntime, the film asserts that the intransigent racism of White Americans\nundermines integration as a panacea to the ills of this racist society\n(Wartenberg 1999). And many other films employ this narrative figure\nto investigate other aspects of racism and possibilities for its\novercoming. \n\nSimilarly, philosophers have looked outside of Hollywood to the films\nof progressive filmmakers like John Sayles to illustrate their belief\nthat narrative films can make sophisticated political statements. A\nfilm like Matewan is shown to involve a sophisticated\ninvestigation of the relationship between class and race as sites of\nsocial domination. \n\nIn general, then, we can say that philosophers have resisted a\nmonolithic condemnation of films as socially regressive and explored\nthe different means that filmmakers have used to present critical\nperspectives on areas of social concern. While they have not ignored\nthe ways in which standard Hollywood narratives undermine critical\nsocial awareness, they have shown that narrative film is an important\nvehicle for communal reflection on important social issues of the\nday. \n\nEver since Plato banished poets from his ideal city in The\nRepublic, hostility towards the arts has been endemic to\nphilosophy. To a large extent, this is because philosophy and the\nvarious artforms were perceived to be competing sources of knowledge\nand belief. Philosophers concerned to maintain the exclusivity of\ntheir claim to truth have dismissed the arts as poor pretenders to the\ntitle of purveyors of truth. \n\nPhilosophers of film have generally opposed this view, seeing film as\na source of knowledge and, even, as potential contributor to\nphilosophy itself. This view was forcefully articulated by Stanley\nCavell, whose interest in the philosophy of film helped spark the\nfield's development. For Cavell, philosophy is inherently concerned\nwith skepticism and the different ways that it can be overcome. In his\nmany books and articles, Cavell has argued that film shares this\nconcern with philosophy and can even provide philosophic insights of\nits own (Cavell 1981; 1996; 2004). \nUntil recently, there have been few adherents to the idea that films\ncan make a philosophical contribution. (But see Kupfer (1999) and\nFreeland (2000) for counterinstances.) In part, this is because\nCavell's\nlinking of film to skepticism seems inadequately grounded, while his\naccount of skepticism as a live option for contemporary philosophy is\nbased on a highly idiosyncratic reading of the history of modern\nphilosophy. Nonetheless, Cavell's interpretations of individual films'\nencounter with skepticism are highly suggestive and have influenced\nmany philosophers and film scholars with the seriousness with which\nthey take film. (For one example, see Mulhall (2001).) Now, however, there is an ongoing debate about the philosophical\ncapacity of film.  In opposition to views like that of Cavell, a\nnumber of philosophers have argued that films can have at most a\nheuristic or pedagogic function in relation to philosophy.  Others\nhave asserted that there are clear limits to what films can accomplish\nphilosophically.  Both of these types of views regard the narrative\ncharacter of fiction films as disqualifying them from genuinely being\nor doing philosophy. Opponents to this point of view have pointed to a number of\ndifferent ways in which films can do philosophy.  Foremost among these\nis the thought experiment.  Thought experiments involve imaginary\nscenarios in which readers are asked to imagine what things would be\nlike if such-and-such were the case.  Those who think that films can\nactually do philosophy point out that fiction films can function as\nphilosophical thought experiments and thus qualify as philosophical\n(See Wartenberg 2007).  Many films have been suggested as candidates\nfor doing philosophy, including the Wachowski Brothers' 1999\nhit The Matrix, a film that has engendered more philosophical\ndiscussion than any other film, Memento (2000),\nand Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004).   Philosophers have also begun to pay attention to a strand of\navant-garde filmmaking known as structural films.  These\nfilms are analogues to minimalism in the other arts and thus give rise\nto the question of whether they are not actual experiments that seek\nto show necessary criteria for something being a film.  If this view\nis accepted, then these films—examples include The\nFlicker (1995) and Serene Velocity (1970)—could be\nseen as making a contribution to philosophy by identifying such\nputative necessary features of films. This view, while adopted by\nNöel Carroll (See Carroll and Choi 2006; Thomas Wartenberg\n2007), has also been criticized on similar grounds to those used to\ndeny the philosophical potential of fiction films, namely that films\ncannot actually do the “hard work” of philosophy. Philosophers working in the Continental tradition have advocated a\nmore sweeping account of film's contribution to philosophy.  Indeed,\nthe term \"film-philosophy\" has been introduced to refer to the\nallegedly new form of philosophizing that takes place on film.  (See\nSinnerbrink 2011 for a discussion of this idea.) Whatever position one takes\non the possibility of “cinematic philosophy,” it is clear that the\nphilosophical relevance of film has been recognized by philosophers.\n Even those who deny that films can actually do philosophy have to\nacknowledge that films provide audiences with access to philosophical\nquestions and issues.  Indeed, the success of the book series\nentitled “Philosophy and X,” where one can substitute any film or\ntelevision show for X, indicates that films are bringing philosophical\nissues to the attention of wide audiences.  There can be no doubt\nthat this is a healthy development for philosophy itself. \nThe philosophy of film has become a significant area for philosophical and\naesthetic research.  Philosophers have concentrated both on aesthetic\nissues about film as an artistic medium — the philosophy of film\n— and questions about the philosophical content of films — films\nas philosophy.  The sophistication and quantity of contributions in\nboth of these areas continue to increase, as more philosophers have taken\nfilm seriously as a subject for philosophical investigation. As film and its related digital media continue to expand in their\ninfluence upon the lives of human beings, the philosophy of film can\nbe expected to become an even more vital area for philosophic\ninvestigation.  In the coming years, we can look forward to new and\ninnovative contributions to this exciting area of philosophical\nresearch."}]
