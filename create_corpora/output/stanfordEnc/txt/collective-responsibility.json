Hence, it is, like its\ntwo more purely individualistic counterparts, almost always a notion\nof moral, rather than purely causal, responsibility.\nBut, unlike its two more purely individualistic counterparts, it does\nnot associate either causal responsibility or blameworthiness with\ndiscrete individuals or locate the source of moral responsibility in\nthe free will of individual moral agents. Instead, it associates both\ncausal responsibility and blameworthiness with groups and\nlocates the source of moral responsibility in the collective actions\ntaken by these groups understood as collectives.\n\n\nSince this notion of collective responsibility makes groups, as\ndistinct from their individual members, out to be moral agents, it has\nundergone a great deal of scrutiny in recent years by methodological\nand normative individualists alike. Methodological individualists\nchallenge the very possibility of associating moral agency with\ngroups, as distinct from their individual members, and normative\nindividualists argue that collective responsibility violates\nprinciples of both individual responsibility and fairness. In response\nto these challenges, proponents of collective responsibility set out\nto show that collective responsibility, as well as group intentions,\ncollective action, and group blameworthiness, are metaphysically\npossible and can be ascribed to agents fairly in at least some, if not\nall, cases.\n\n\nWhile the vast majority of those now writing on collective\nresponsibility in philosophical circles continue to debate the\npossibility of collective responsibility, a smaller group of scholars\nhas in recent years placed two further—and very\nimportant—concerns at the center of our attention. The first has\nto do with whether groups have to meet the same stringent conditions\nof moral responsibility that individuals do. (Intentionality becomes a\nprimary site of controversy here.) The second has to do with the\nadvantages and disadvantages of holding particular kinds of groups,\ne.g., nation states, races, and ethnic groups, morally responsible in\npractice. \n\n\nThe backward looking notion of collective responsibility cited above\nis what most philosophers have in mind when they talk about collective\nresponsibility. But during the past several years there has been a\ngrowing interest in what has come to be known as forward looking\ncollective responsibility. Forward looking collective\nresponsibility, unlike its backward looking counterpart, does not\nfocus on whether a particular collective agent caused harm in the\nsense relevant to moral blameworthiness. Instead, it focuses on what,\nif anything, the agent can be expected to do with respect to remedying\nthe harm. Hence, it is sometimes referred to as remedial\nresponsibility.\n\nBoth notions of collective responsibility are controversial. The\ntraditional, backward looking, notion does not sit well with those who\nare skeptical about the ability of collective entities to\nwill and to act as collective entities. The forward\nlooking notion is less controversial than its backward looking\ncounterpart is with respect to its metaphysical foundations. But it\ndoes raise questions about how—on the basis of what norms and\nprinciples—we can ascribe such responsibility in practice. \nThree kinds of controversies surround the traditional notion of\ncollective responsibility. \nThe first of these controversies concerns whether or not collective\nresponsibility makes sense as a form of moral responsibility. Not\nsurprisingly, the primary focus of attention here has been with both\nthe moral agency of groups in general and the possibility of group\nintentions in particular. How, participants in this controversy have\nasked, can we understand the notion of collective responsibility as a\nmatter of moral—and not just causal—responsibility? Is it\npossible for groups, as distinct from their members, to cause harm in\nthe sense required by moral responsibility? to act as collectives? to\nhave intentions? Is it possible for groups, as distinct from their\nmembers, to be morally blameworthy for bringing about harm? to be\nguilty as moral agents? \nThe second controversy, interestingly enough, is not really about the\nmoral responsibility of groups at all, even though it is couched in\nthe language of collective moral responsibility. Instead, it is about\nthe moral responsibility of individuals who belong to groups that are\nthemselves thought to be morally responsible for particular cases of\nharm. How, participants in this controversy have asked, can we\ndistribute collective responsibility across individual members of such\na group? Does it makes sense to distribute collective responsibility\nin general? Is it appropriate to hold individual group members morally\nresponsible for harm that other group members caused? that the group\nitself caused? that the group as a whole failed to prevent? If so,\nunder what conditions and with respect to what particular kinds of\ngroups? Random collections of individuals? Interest-based groups?\nCorporate entities? When collective responsibility is distributed to\nindividuals, are the individuals morally blameworthy or are they\nmerely liable for remedying harm that the group caused? \nThe third controversy is primarily normative and concerns the value of\nascribing collective responsibility in practice. In some cases, the\nconcern is with the general practice of collective responsibility and\nits consequences for our ability to sustain the values of\nindividualism, freedom, and justice. In other cases, the concern is\nwith the ascriptions of collective responsibility in particular\ncontexts, e.g., in the contexts of war tribunals, reparations for\nslavery, terrorism, and rape, and with whether such ascriptions are\nproductive and/or fair to those being blamed. What would happen,\ncritics ask, if we were to replace individual responsibility with\ncollective responsibility? Would we be letting individuals off the\nhook? Would we be eroding the practice of personal responsibility in\ngeneral? \nThe controversies surrounding forward looking collective\nresponsibility have to do with both the role of agent causation in\nascribing responsibility for remedying harm in the world and the norms\nand principles that may—or may not—be appropriate to\ninvoke in this context. Does responsibility for remedying harm come\ndown to who caused the harm? If not, what other criteria should we\nemploy? Do considerations of fairness have a place in our ascriptions\nof remedial responsibility? If so, what kind of fairness is relevant?\nWhat role, if any, should membership in a particular community play\nhere? Would a social contract be helpful in deciding who should be\nresponsible for remedying or preventing particular kinds of harm? \nAlmost all of those now writing about collective responsibility agree\nthat collective responsibility would make sense if it were merely an\naggregative phenomenon. But they disagree markedly about whether\ncollective responsibility makes sense as a non-distributive\nphenomenon, i.e., as a phenomenon that transcends the contributions of\nparticular group members. In this context, as in many others, skeptics\nset the agenda. Two claims become crucial. The first is that groups,\nunlike individuals, cannot form intentions and hence cannot be\nunderstood to act or to cause harm qua groups. The second is\nthat groups, as distinct from their individual members, cannot be\nunderstood as morally blameworthy in the sense required by moral\nresponsibility. \nBoth claims come out of classical methodological individualism of the\nsort articulated by Max Weber (Weber 1914) and H. D. Lewis (Lewis\n1948) in their respective rejections of collective responsibility. In\nEconomy and Society Vol. I, Weber (Weber 1914) argues that\ncollective responsibility makes no sense both because we cannot\nisolate genuinely collective actions, as distinct from identical\nactions of many persons, and because groups, unlike the individuals\nwho belong to them, cannot think as groups or formulate intentions of\nthe kind normally thought to be necessary to actions. H. D. Lewis\nfollows suit in his own arguments and couples his methodological\nindividualism with a sense of moral outrage at the idea of blaming\nindividuals for the actions of others. Lewis writes: \nContemporary critics of collective responsibility do not generally go\nas far as Lewis does here in equating collective responsibility with\nbarbarism. But they do generally share their predecessors’\nskepticism about the possibility of both group intentions and\ngenuinely collective actions. (See below.) Likewise, they, too, worry\nabout the fairness of ascribing collective responsibility to\nindividuals who do not themselves directly cause harm or who do not\nbring about harm purposefully. Stephen Sverdlik writes: \nBoth of these claims—that genuinely collective actions are not\npossible and that it would be unfair to consider agents morally\nblameworthy for harm that they did not bring about\npurposively—rest on two normative assumptions that are key to\nthe critic’s position. Both concern the importance of\nintentions. The first is that actions—whether they are\nindividual or collective—necessarily begin with intentions.\n(Otherwise, they are not actions but instead kinds of behavior.) The\nsecond is that moral blameworthiness has its source in and requires\nthe existence of bad intentions—or at least moral\nfaultiness—on the part of those being held responsible. \nThe first assumption, namely, that all actions begin with intentions,\nis very useful to critics because it enables them to write group\nintentions into the definition of collective action itself and hence\nrender group intentions a necessary condition of collective\nresponsibility. J. Angelo Corlett’s definition of a collective\naction is typical here. According to Corlett, \nThe second assumption, namely, that moral blameworthiness of all kinds\nis grounded in the bad intentions of moral agents who cause harm, is\nalso very useful to critics of collective responsibility, since it\nenables them to stipulate that collective responsibility requires, not\njust group intentions, but the ability of groups to have bad\nintentions or at least to be morally faulty. How, critics ask, can\ngroups, as distinct from their individual members, be understood to\nhave bad intentions? to be morally faulty? to have a moral character,\nfaulty or not? How, in other words, can they be understood as\nappropriate bearers of moral blameworthiness, guilt, or shame? \nA majority of critics here concentrate on showing either that actions\nare associated exclusively with individuals, not groups, or that\ngroups, which do not have minds of their own, cannot make choices or\nhold beliefs in the sense required by the formulation of intentions.\nH. D Lewis concentrates on making both points in his 1948 critique of\ncollective responsibility. So, too, does J. W. N. Watkins (1957).\nLater methodological individualists such as Alvin Goldman (1970),\nStephen Sverdlik (1987), J. Angelo Corlett (Corlett 2001), and Jan\nNarveson (2002), unlike their predecessors, are generally willing to\nacknowledge the sensibility of collective responsibility in a limited\nnumber of cases. But, they, too, draw attention to the host of\ndifficulties that arise for collective responsibility as a moral\nconstruct once we acknowledge the simple fact that collectives do not\nhave full blown mental lives. \nCritics of collective responsibility pay somewhat less attention to\nthe nature of collective moral blameworthiness than they do to the\nnature of collective actions. But they do sometimes worry about the\nappropriateness of associating moral blameworthiness with groups, as\ndistinct from group members. R. S. Downie, among others, places what\nturns out to be a very traditional notion of moral responsibility at\nthe center of his attention and argues that \nJan Narveson goes as far in this context as to argue that the bearers\nof moral blameworthiness have to be individuals because only\nindividuals can have moral agency. “Nothing else,”\nNarveson writes, “can literally be the bearer of full\nresponsibility” (Narveson 2002, p. 179). The word\n“literally” here turns out to be significant for those\nwriting on collective responsibility. For, it contrasts with the sense\nshared by Narveson and others that we might in the end be able to make\nsense of collective responsibility in metaphorical terms by treating\nindividual moral agency, including both agent causation and moral\nblameworthiness, as a metaphor for group agency of the sort relevant\nto moral responsibility traditionally understood. \nDefenders of collective responsibility rely on a variety of\nphilosophical strategies to debunk the above claims and to justify\nboth the possibility of collective responsibility in some, if not all,\ncases, and the coherence of collective responsibility as an\nintellectual construct. One of these strategies has been simply to\npoint out both that we blame groups all the time in practice and that\nwe do so in a way that is difficult to analyze with the precepts of\nmethodological individualism. David Cooper, among others, uses this\nstrategy to great effect in his own defense of collective\nresponsibility. According to Cooper, “[t]here is an obvious\npoint to be recognized and that obvious point is that responsibility\nis ascribed to collectives, as well as to individual persons. Blaming\nattitudes are held towards collective as well as towards\nindividuals,” (Cooper 1968, p. 258.) \nDeborah Tollefsen (Tollefsen, 2003) zeros in on the fact that we\nexpress various reactive attitudes to groups, e.g., anger, resentment,\nand moral indignation. How, she asks, can we make sense of these\nattitudes? She argues that we cannot do so by simply positing that our\nemotions are misfiring here or that our attitudes are really directed\nat group members rather than at groups themselves. Instead, we have to\nrecognize that, within our practices of moral responsibility (a\nlà Strawson), groups have the ability of moral address and\nexhibit moral competence.  \nBut of course our practices of moral responsibility, as well as the\nreactive attitudes that ground them, may not be justified. Cooper\nhimself acknowledges that both our use of language here and our\nblaming attitudes may be misguided. Hence, they find it necessary to\nshow, not just that we ascribe blame to collectives in practice, but\nthat the collective blame that we ascribe cannot be analyzed in terms\nof individual blame. Cooper himself takes on this project by exploring\nparticular cases of blame, e.g., those associated with sports clubs\nand nations, that, he argues, can only attach to groups. According to\nCooper, when we look at how such collectives act, we see that whether\nwe regard statements about collectives as propositional functions or\nnot, we cannot deduce from them statements about particular\nindividuals. “This is so,” he argues, “because the\nexistence of a collective is compatible with varying membership. No\ndeterminate set of individuals is necessary for the existence of the\ncollective” (Cooper 1968, p. 260). \nIn a similar vein, Peter French focuses on that class of predicates\nthat, he contends, can only be true of collectives. According to\nFrench, \nA majority of those who defend the possibility of group actions in\nthis context rely on linguistic analyses. But there are also those\nwho, like Larry May, turn instead to social theory and to the\nexistentialist tradition. May himself uses the relational theory of\nJean-Paul Sartre to argue that groups can legitimately be ascribed\nactions in cases where individuals are related to one another and act\nin ways together that would not be possible if they acted alone. May\nsets down two relationally-based conditions under which we can\nlegitimately say of an action that it is collective rather than\nindividual—which for May means, not trans-individual, but\nrelational. The first condition is that the individuals in question be\nrelated to each other so as to enable each to act in ways that they\ncould not manage on their own. The second is that some individuals be\nauthorized to represent their own actions as the actions of the group\nas a whole (May 1987, p. 55). \nWhat about group intentions? Not surprisingly, group intentions\npresent an even greater challenge than group actions do. For,\nintentions are mental states and hence not the kinds of things that\nare normally thought to be shareable. Are they shareable? \nAccording to Brook Sadler and others, the question is inherently\npuzzling. For, “if intentions are mental states, states which\nplay a fundamental role in an agent’s practical deliberation and\nvolition, the prospect of a shared intention introduces the specter of\nshared mental states and hence shared minds”—which is\nsomething that philosophers have traditionally hoped to leave behind.\n(Sadler 2006, p.115.) \nIndeed, the possibility that collective responsibility requires, not\nonly collective actions and intentions, but a collective mind, has\nproven to be one of the greatest challenges to those who want to\nsustain a notion of collective responsibility. For while groups can\nlegitimately be said to have beliefs and other states characteristic\nof a mind in particular cases, e.g., when the group is organized\naround such beliefs, they do not seem to have minds in any sense other\nthan their ability to build on the minds of individual members. As\nDavid Sosa argues, “groups might be said to have a mind or a\nwill but only in a derivative sense: the persons that are members of\nthe group have minds, and the group’s mind (in whatever sense it\nhas one, its beliefs and desires) is some sort of construct from those\nminds” (Sosa 2007, p. 215). \nBut does the positing of a shared intention really require us to talk\nabout a collective mind or, for that matter, a unified moral subject?\nMichael Bratman appears to have developed a coherent view of\ncollective intentions that does not require us to go that far.\nAccording to Bratman, we can talk about collective intentions as\nintentions that are shared among group members. \nIn Shared Agency: A Planning Theory of Acting Together\n(Bratman 2014), Bratman associates these shared intentions with a\npattern of ordinary intentions and beliefs that coordinates multiple\nindividuals’ activity in a fashion analogous to the way in which\nan individual’s intention coordinates her activity through time.\nHere, again, Bratman presents shared intentions as a matter of\n“meshing subplans.” According to Bratman, to say that we\nhave a “shared intention to J,” where J is a joint\nactivity, is to say that “[w]e each have intentions that we J,\nand we each intend that we J by way of each of our intentions that we\nJ and by way of subplans that mesh.” (Bratman 2014, p. 103)  \nBratman provides a very persuasive account of shared intentions here\nand by taking his planning theory of individual agency into the realm\nof coordinated activity, manages to locate and to explain a practice\nof shared agency that gets to the heart of various kinds of collective\nactivities. What, though, about collective responsibility?  \nTwo things are important to underscore here. First of all, Bratman\ndoes not set out to account for a collective mind. Instead, he sets\nout to account for collective intentions. Second, while he suggests in\nShared Agency: A Planning Theory of Acting Together that we\ncan think of shared activity as the activity of a group agent, he\nmakes clear that he is not positing a group subject of the kind\nnecessary to the ascription of moral blameworthiness to the group\nitself qua moral agent.  \nBoth points together suggest that while Bratman’s theory\nprovides us with a very helpful way of understanding both collective\nintentions and coordinated activities of various kinds, as well as a\nbasis for grasping the nature of shared deliberation and shared\nreasoning, it does not provide us with a basis for talking about the\nmoral responsibility of a collective moral agent, or for that matter,\na unified moral subject. Nor was the theory designed to do so.  \nHow, if at all, might we talk about the kind of collective moral agent\nand/or unified collective moral subject required by collective moral\nresponsibility? Interestingly enough, defenders of collective\nresponsibility frequently turn back here to the works of Durkheim\n(1895) and Simmel (1971), as well as to that of Sartre (1960), for\ninspiration, although they themselves proceed analytically. Margaret\nGilbert, who grounds several of her arguments in Durkheim’s\ntheory of social facts, develops what she calls a\n“plural-subject account” of shared intentions to justify\nthe coherence of collective responsibility (Gilbert 1989, 2000, 2006\nand 2013). She does so in large part by zeroing in on joint\ncommitments. According to Gilbert, group intentions exist when two or\nmore persons constitute the plural subject of an intention to carry\nout a particular action, or, in other words, when “they are\njointly committed to intending as a body to do A”\n(Gilbert, 2000, p. 22). David Velleman goes on to stress the unified\nnature of this plural subject. A “truly plural subject”,\nhe writes, involves “two or more subjects who combine in such a\nway as to make one subject” (Velleman 1997). Both Gilbert and\nVelleman make clear that a unified moral subject is required of a\ncollective moral responsibility.  \nWhile Gilbert and Velleman provide us with a compelling view of a\nplural subject, two questions remain. Does their plural subject\nconstitute a unified moral subject of the kind that can be morally\nblameworthy for bringing about harm? If so, is the kind of moral\nblameworthiness associated with such a unified moral subject the same\nin the case of a collective as it is in the case of individual moral\nagents? We address these questions in Section 5.  \nSuffice it to point out here both that (as Gilbert herself recognizes)\nsuch a unified moral subject is necessary to collective moral\nresponsibility and that the location of a plural subject is not the\nonly way of making sense of a collective moral agent. Raimo Tuomela\n(1989, 2005, 2006 and 2013) chooses a somewhat different strategy in\nhis defense of collective responsibility. He puts forward what he\ncalls “we intentions.” Like Gilbert, he constructs a\ncollective subject on the basis of joint commitments and then applies\nit to the notion of collective responsibility. But he does not, like\nGilbert, stress the pluralistic nature of this subject. Instead, he\nargues that collective intentional agency supervenes on\nindividual intentional agency in ways that allow us to talk about both\ncollective intentions and collective actions. According to Tuomela,\nactions by collectives supervene on the actions of the\noperative members of the collective in such a way that the properties\nof particular collectives, such as their intentions, beliefs, and\ndesires, are “embodied in” and “determined by”\nthe perspectives of the properties of individual members or\nrepresentatives of the collective in question (Tuomela 1989, p.\n494). \nInterestingly enough, Tuomela’s attempt here to save collective\nresponsibility by positing such a representative subject recalls the\nefforts of Thomas Hobbes to create a collective subject in the guise\nof his Leviathan (1651). Hobbes, in an effort both to explain\nsovereignty in general and to justify the legitimacy of the English\nmonarchy in particular, posited a higher authority in the\ncommunity—the Leviathan—whose own will, as well as\nactions, came to be those of its/his subjects as a result of their\nhaving transferred their own agency to it/him as part of the only kind\nof social contract that from Hobbes’s perspective made\ncollective life possible. Hobbes’s collective subject not only\nrepresented group members but captured their very being as members of\nhis Leviathan. \nContemporary defenders of collective responsibility sometimes recall\nHobbes’s Leviathan in their own attempt to develop a collective\nsubject (see for example: Copp 1980). But they do not, in light of\nHobbes’s own authoritarianism, go as far as to accept\nHobbes’s argument that a Leviathan is necessary to capture the\ncollective will. Nor do they generally toy with the possibility of\nreintroducing the seemingly more benevolent general will of Rousseau\n(1762) as a way of substantiating group intentions. Instead, they look\nfor an alternative, less authoritarian, way of substantiating group\nintentions—representational or not—or else argue that\ngroup intentions of the sort associated with traditional Kantian\nnotions of moral agency are not after all necessary to collective\nmoral responsibility. \nLarry May offers one of the most interesting arguments of the latter\nsort in his own defense of collective moral agency (May 1987, 2006 and\n2010). May rejects many of the above accounts of group intentions as\ntoo closely tied to Kantian notions of moral agency. But he does not\ndo away with group intentions as a necessary condition of collective\nresponsibility. Nor does he accept a fully collectivist methodology.\nInstead, he reformulates group intentions within a theory of what he\ncalls interdependence and, in doing so, develops a general outlook on\ncollective responsibility that not only combines individualism and\ncollectivism but places both relationships and social structures at\nthe center of our attention. The challenge here becomes to describe\nwhat such group intentions actually look like. \nMay relies in this context once again on the work of Sartre to develop\nhis account of group intentions and posits what he calls a\n“pre-reflective intention”, i.e., “an intention\nwhich is not yet reflected upon by each of the members of the\ngroup” (May 1987 p. 64). May makes clear here that group\nintentions of this sort arise out of the relationships between\nparticular members of a group rather than from any one group member.\nHence, while they are not trans-individual or collective in any sense\nthat stands totally above individuals, they can be treated “as\nif they are collective” (May 1987, p. 64) Moreover, these\nintentions are, May makes clear, not individual intentions\nbut group-based. “Since each member of the group comes\nto have the same intention, either reflectively or\npre-reflectively”, it is “different from their individual\nintentions.” Indeed, “the sameness of intention is\ncollective in the sense that it is caused by the group structure, that\nis, it is group-based” (May 1987, p. 65). The question for May,\nas for the others, is whether the “sameness of intention”\nis sufficient for talking about a collective moral agent worthy of\nblame. \nWhile many of those defending the possibility of collective moral\nresponsibility do not explore the conditions of collective moral\nblameworthiness, List and Pettit (2011), in an important work on the\nsubject, extend inquiry about collective moral agency into the realm\nof ethical, political, and legal accountability. List and Pettit argue\nthat groups can meet the requirements of moral agency by virtue of the\nfact that they “have representational states, motivational\nstates, and a capacity to process them and act on their basis.”\n(List and Pettit 2011, p. 21) Likewise, they argue that groups can\nhave obligations, entitlements, and power relations that have hitherto\ngone unnoticed and that require our moral attention.  \nList and Pettit devote a great deal of their own attention to how we\nmight use our recognition of these obligations, entitlements, and\npower relations to re-work various institutions in contemporary\nsociety. But they do not neglect the question of collective moral\nblameworthiness. Nor do they simply assume that such blameworthiness\nfollows automatically from group moral agency. Instead they make clear\nthat in order for a group to be morally blameworthy, its actions must\nbe associated with a “grave matter”; the group must have\n“full knowledge of guilt”; and there must have been\n“full consent of the will” (List and Pettit 2011, 155).\nList and Pettit think that these conditions can be met by at least\nsome groups. Are they right?  \nWhile they provide convincing evidence that at least some groups can\nmeet the first two conditions, we need, once again, to be worried\nabout the third, i.e., that which pertains to the willfulness or\ncontrol of a collective agent. In their own words, “the question\nraised by the third condition is whether a group agent is in control\nover the actions it takes so that we might expect its normative\njudgment, for example, to be capable of impacting on its\nbehavior” (List and Pettit, 2011, 159). How can a group, above\nits individual members, exert this level of control?  \nList and Pettit do not answer this question. Instead, they point out\n(correctly) that the question is not more serious for groups than it\nis for individuals. \nBut if we are going to justify the possibility of group moral\nblameworthiness, we cannot be satisfied with simply knowing that the\nmatter of control is no more serious for groups than it is for\nindividuals. Instead, we have to know what group control entails in\nthis context and whether it is possible. In other words, we have to\ndevelop the kind of explanation of group control that List and Pettit\nconcede is important, as well as an account of the “whatever\nsuch control involves” that they cite. \nWhile List and Pettit do not provide us with either of these things\n(leaving the possiblity of group moral blameworthiness still up in the\nair), they do make two related points of importance. The first is that\ncontrol in this context does not need to reside in the group\nor in individuals. Instead, it can reside simultaneously in\nboth places, albeit in different forms: “programming\ncauses” vs. “implementing causes” (List and Pettit,\n2011, p. 162).  \nThe second is that we need to think, not only about whether groups are\nmorally responsible for harm, but about whether we should\nhold them morally responsible for harm and, if so, under what\nconditions. List and Pettit do not take a wholly consequentialist\napproach to the latter matter. But they do underscore the positive\nconsequences that can follow from our holding groups morally\nresponsible in particular cases, consequences that range from our\n“recognition... of the true contours of the moral and political\nworld we inhabit” (List and Pettit 2011, p. 185) to the\npersuasion of group members to give up harmful behaviors to the\nsocialization of group members to act more responsibly in the future.\nWe discuss these and other consequences more fully in Section 6.  \nWhile French, Gilbert, May, and others who concentrate on redeeming\ncollective responsibility as an intellectual construct do so by\ndefending the coherence of collective actions and group intentions,\nthey do not go as far as to assert that all kinds of groups are\ncapable of acting and intending collectively. Nor do they go as far as\nto assert that all kinds of groups can be understood as collectively\nresponsible for bringing about harm. Instead, they assert that only\nparticular kinds of groups are capable of acting and intending\ncollectively and that only particular kinds of groups are capable of\nbeing collectively responsible for harm. What kinds of groups are\nthese? \nThe most common approach taken to distinguishing between appropriate\nand inappropriate sites of collective responsibility has been to focus\non nations, corporations, and other groups that have well-ordered\ndecision-making procedures in place, since, it is argued, these groups\nare, by virtue of their well-ordered decision-making procedures, able\nto demonstrate two things that are often assumed to be necessary to\ncollective responsibility. The first is a set of group actions that\nhave an identifiable moral agent, e.g., a governing board or a\nrepresentative body, behind them capable of carrying out a group\naction. The second is a set of decisions that are made\nself-consciously on a rational basis—or at least\npurposively—by the group that take the form of group intentions\nor group choices. \nPeter French considers groups that are so organized to be especially\nappropriate sites of collective responsibility because of three\nsalient features that they all share. The first is a series of\norganizational mechanisms through which courses of concerted action\ncan be, though not necessarily are, chosen on a rational basis. The\nsecond is a set of enforced standards of conduct for individuals that\nare more stringent than those usually thought to apply in the larger\ncommunity of individuals, standards that enable us to talk about both\ngroup conduct and group discipline. The third is a configuration of\n“defined roles by which individuals can exercise certain powers\n” (French 1984, pp. 13–14) All three of these features,\naccording to French, signal the existence of purposeful and controlled\nactions that are capable of rendering groups collectively responsible\nfor harm. \nA second approach to the location of appropriate sites of collective\nresponsibility has been to use groups such as ethnic communities,\nclubs, and social movements as paradigmatic cases of appropriate\ncollective responsibility on the grounds that these groups have\nmembers who share interests or needs in common. Two assumptions\nprevail here. The first is that groups whose members share interests\nor needs in common show signs of group solidarity, which Joel Feinberg\ndefines in this context as a matter of individuals taking a strong\ninterest in each others’ interests (Feinberg 1968). The second\nis that groups that show signs of group solidarity understood in this\nway are capable of acting and intending in the sense relevant to\ncollective responsibility, since while they are made up of\nindividuals, they pursue projects together. \nNot surprisingly, group solidarity is generally thought to exist\nprimarily in either cases where group members identify themselves as\ngroup members and assert their shared interests and needs or in cases\nwhere group members exhibit collective consciousness to the extent\nthat they are inclined to take pride or feel shame in group actions\nwithout prompting. But, according to at least some of those who make\nuse of the concept of group solidarity here, e.g. Larry May (1987) and\nHoward McGary (1986), group solidarity does not require group\nself-consciousness. Indeed, according to both May and McGary, group\nsolidarity can be understood as present in what McGary calls\n“loosely structured groups”, such as privileged racial\ngroups whose members provide support or benefits to other members\nqua group members, even though they may not, in\nMcGary’s words, “see themselves as interested in one\nanother’s interests” (McGary 1986, p. 158). In these\ngroups, McGary contends, mutual benefits, as well as practices that\nmay, unbeknownst to those who participate in them, maintain forms of\noppression such as racism and sexism, signal group solidarity of the\nsort relevant to collective responsibility. \nA third approach here is to pick up on shared attitudes among\ngroup members as something that renders the group itself an\nappropriate site of collective responsibility. The attitudes taken to\nbe relevant here are generally those that both produce serious harm in\nsociety and that require acceptance by many individuals in a community\ntogether in order to be effective, e.g., attitudes such as racism,\nsexism, and anti-Semitism. May (1987), McGary (1986), Marilyn Friedman\n(Friedman and May 1985) and others cite these attitudes as enough to\nrender groups such as “men” and “white\nAmericans” collectively responsible for the oppression of women\nand black Americans in some, but not all, cases. Other defenders of\ncollective responsibility, e.g., Peter French, refrain from going this\nfar on the grounds that the groups in question are not organized\nenough to be capable of sustaining a sense of moral agency that is\ngenuinely collective (French 1984). \nAll three of the above approaches take us in different directions.\nHence, they are sometimes thought to be competing. But they all rest\non a general distinction between aggregate and conglomerate\ncollectivities. An aggregate collectivity, Peter French writes, is\n“merely a collection of people” (French 1984, p. 5). It is\nnot, from the perspective of most of those now writing on collective\nresponsibility, an appropriate site of collective responsibility. A\nconglomerate collectivity, on the other hand, is an\n“organization of individuals such that its identity is not\nexhausted by the conjunction of the identities of the persons in the\norganization” (French 1984, p. 13). It is, from the perspective\nof most of those now writing on collective responsibility, an\nappropriate site of collective responsibility, since, unlike an\naggregate collectivity, it supplies us with a moral agent capable of\npurposeful action. \nWhile most of those who defend collective responsibility as a moral\nconstruct adhere to this distinction in general, they do not all agree\non what counts as an aggregate collectivity in practice. Indeed, there\nis considerable disagreement among those now writing about collective\nresponsibility (including some who take the above three approaches)\nabout two particular kinds of groups that appear to some to be\naggregative groups. One of these kinds of groups is the mob. The other\nis what Virginia Held calls a “random collection of\nindividuals.” Neither of these kinds of groups has a\ndecision-making procedure in place. Nor do their members show much\nsolidarity. Hence, they are usually rejected as candidates for\ncollective responsibility by many of those who otherwise find the\nnotion of collective responsibility to be very useful. But there are\nthose who put forward both groups as appropriate sites of collective\nresponsibility. \nVirginia Held (Held 1970) argues that members of an unorganized group\nmay be said to be responsible for not taking an action that could have\nprevented harm in cases where they could have done something to\nprevent the harm together but chose not to do so. Her particular\nexamples are those of victims of violence who are beaten or killed in\nfull sight of strangers assembled around them, strangers who are\nthemselves neither related to the victim nor there together as part of\nany group-based project. According to Held, while none of these\nindividuals may have been able to prevent the violence on their own,\nthey could have prevented it if they had organized themselves into a\ngroup, i.e., cooperated with at least some of the others. Hence, they\ncan as a group be blamed for the victims’ suffering and/or\ndeath. \nHeld acknowledges here that holding a random collection of individuals\nresponsible for harm is more difficult than holding an organized group\nresponsible for it, since the latter, unlike the former, has a method\nfor deciding how to act, whether it is a voting procedure or a set of\nhierarchical authority relations. But, she argues, we can still hold\nthe former group, i.e., that which she calls a random collection of\nindividuals, responsible for the violence done to victims, since, if\nthey had tried, they could have come up with such decision-making\nprocedures themselves. “In the foregoing examples,” she\nwrites, “we can say that the random collection of individuals\nwas morally responsible for failing to transform itself into an\norganized group capable of taking action rather than inaction”\nwith respect to the prevention of harm. (Held 1970, p. 479.) \nMobs are often thought to be the last groups that we should be tying\nto hold collectively responsible. For, they completely lack\ndecision-making procedures, their members are seemingly not related,\nand they are often chaotic and irrational. But, Larry May (1987),\nRaimo Tuomela (1989), and others argue, we can nevertheless hold mobs\ncollectively responsible if at least some of their members contribute\ndirectly to harm and others either facilitate these contributions or\nfail to prevent them. For, in these cases, all mob members are\n“implicated” in mob action, even if not all of them\nproduced specific harms or organized together to do so. Tuomela (1989,\n2005, 2006), much like Le Bon (1896) before him, argues that both\ncrowds and rioters are appropriate sites of collective responsibility\nby virtue of the fact that they perform their acts as members of a\ngroup, even if they do not think of themselves as doing so. \nInterestingly enough, in both of these cases—mobs and what Held\ncalls random collections of individuals—the groups in question\nmay not be as unrelated as Held and others suggest they are. Indeed,\nit may be precisely because these groups are made up of individuals\nwho become related to each other in the process of\nproducing harm together (even though they were initially strangers)\nthat they are now potentially appropriate sites of collective\nresponsibility. Stanley Bates suggests as much in his own arguments\nthat Held has presented us with a group that is neither as random nor\nas disconnected as the term “random” normally suggests,\nbut that is “related” to the extent that group whose\nmembers share a particular challenge and are capable of communicating\nwith one another (Bates 1971). \nIn almost all of the examples relied upon in discussions of group\nstructure and collective responsibility, the groups in question are\nmade up of living members. But in recent years, a number of efforts\nhave been made to hold groups morally responsible for actions\nperformed by earlier generations. The case of slavery tends to take\ncenter stage here and is often accompanied by arguments for\nreparations. While such efforts have generally taken place in the\nlegal arena, they have not been excluded entirely from contemporary\nphilosophical discussions of collective responsibility. Indeed, in\nrecent years, a variety of philosophers have set out to ascribe moral\nresponsibility to groups whose present members were not even alive\nwhen the bad actions in question were carried out, even though, as\nJanna Thompson points out, “not being born when an injustice\ntook place seems to be a very good reason for denying any\nresponsibility” (Thompson 2006, p. 155). \nHow can we possibly hope to hold groups morally responsible for the\nbad actions of previous generations? Farid Abdel-Nour (Abdel-Nour,\n2003) argues that community solidarity is sufficient to render at\nleast some kinds of groups morally responsible for the harms brought\nabout by earlier generations, especially if there is a high level of\ncross-generational identification and pride in one’s\nancestors’ deeds.  \nNot surprisingly, these kinds of arguments run into trouble when\nquestions of agency arise. For, while the existence of solidarity and\nidentification may allow us to talk about a group over time and even\nlabel its actions morally wrong,they do not allow us to posit the kind\nof agency that is required of moral responsibility as traditionally\nunderstood. For, as Michael Bratman shows in his own work on\ncollective responsibility, the latter requires, not only that\nindividuals share intentions but that they interact. (See\nespecially Bratman 2000). \nWhile most of those writing on collective responsibility seem to agree\nwith Bratman here on the necessity of interaction, not all do. Linda\nRadzik (Radzik 2001) claims that we need only show that existing group\nmembers benefit from a past injustice to hold them responsible for it.\nLarry May makes similar claims throughout his work, including in his\narguments that men are collectively responsible for rape and whites in\nthe U.S. are collectively responsible for racism (May and Strikwerda\n1994). \nWhat place does benefiting from harm have in the ascription of\ncollective responsibility? As Janna Thompson (2002, 2006) points out,\nto benefit from a harm is not the same thing as to cause it. Hence\nbenefit—as when men benefit from sexism and whites from\nracism—does not appear to be an appropriate source of collective\nresponsibility for the past actions of others. But it might be an\nappropriate source of collective responsibility for the\nprolongation of the harm and/or its consequences into the\nfuture. In other words, it might be an appropriate source of\ncollective responsibility for present and future, if not for past,\ninjustices—including injustices that began with earlier wrongs.\n \nMoreover, while groups of persons might not be good candidates for\nmorally responsibility for past injustices, particular kinds of\ncollective entities—e.g., states, corporations, and organized\nreligions—might be. For, the latter have decision-making bodies,\nexecutive processes, and belief systems that extend over time. J.\nThompson (2006) argues therefore that they can be understood as\nlegitimate sites of moral responsibility—although it is not\nclear that they have the kinds of agency that we normally associate\nwith moral responsibility. \nHow, if they are not moral agents, can Thompson or anyone else speak\nof groups such as states, corporations and organized religions, as\nmorally responsible? Thompson feels comfortable speaking of these\ngroups as morally responsible for harm on the grounds that they are\nlike moral agents. According to Thompson, “whether they\ncount as real moral persons or only act as if they were, it seems that\nwe are, at least sometimes, justified in judging these collectives\naccording to the standards that we apply to moral persons”\n(Thompson, 2006, p. 158). \nBut it is not clear that likeness is strong enough to sustain\nthe nature of these groups as moral agents of the kind that we\nnormally associate with moral responsibility. For “acting like a\nmoral agent” is not the same thing as being a moral agent. (And\nif one really is a moral agent then there is no need to go to the\nlengths of specifying likeness.) \nWe suggest below that the unlikelihood that groups are really moral\nagents does not mean that the latter cannot be held morally\nresponsible for harm. But it does mean that we have to re-think the\nkinds of moral responsibility that we associate with groups in such a\nway that moral agents of the Kantian kind are not necessary. \nCollective responsibility refers to the responsibility of a\ncollective entity, e.g., a corporation, a nation state, or a club, for\nharm in the world. Shared responsibilty refers to the\nresponsibility of group members for such harm in cases where they\nacted together to bring the harm about. Collective responsibility is\nassociated with a single, unified, moral agent. Shared responsibility\nis associated with individual moral agents who contribute to harm as\nmembers of a group either directly through their own actions or\nindirectly through their membership in the group.  \nContemporary moral and political philosophers are generally careful to\ndistinguish between collective responsibility, on the one hand, and\nshared and individual responsibility, on the other. But they do not\nleave individual moral agents behind altogether. Indeed, after\nanalyzing collective responsibility as part of group morality, they\nfrequently place individual moral agents back at the center of their\nattention in an effort to discern what collective responsibility means\non the level of individual moral actors. Is it possible, they ask, for\nindividual members of a group to be collectively responsible for\ngroup-based harms in cases where they did not directly cause it? In\ncases where they did not do anything to stop it? If so, under what\nconditions? \nWhile those who answer these questions tend to focus on the\ntransferability of collective responsibility and its relationship to\nindividual moral agency in general, they do not ignore concrete\nhistorical examples in which the moral responsibility of particular\ngroups of individuals for harm is in question. Indeed, almost all of\nthose who write about collective responsibility and the question of\ndistribution place such concrete historical examples of harm at the\ncenter of their analyses of collective responsibility in an effort,\nnot just to understand collective responsibility as an abstract\nconstruct, but to discern whether or not particular groups of\nindividuals in history can be held morally responsible for harms that\ntheir groups caused, whether those groups are ethnic groups\n(“Germans”), nations (“America”) or racial\ngroups (“Whites”). \nBoth Karl Jaspers (1961) and Hannah Arendt (1987), as well H. D. Lewis\n(1948), were clearly concerned in their writings on collective\nresponsibility about whether or not the German people can legitimately\nbe held collectively responsible for World War II Nazi crimes. So,\ntoo, were Sanford Levinson (1974), Richard Wasserstrom (1971) and\nothers who produced their own arguments about collective\nresponsibility in light of the Nuremberg trials. The My Lai killings\nof the Viet Nam War, along with the Kitty Genovese murder and\ncorporate scandals of all kinds, influenced much of the philosophical\nwork done on collective responsibility during the 1970s and 80s,\nincluding that of Peter French, Larry May, and Virginia Held, and\nwhile it is only recently that group-based oppression such as racism\nand sexism have come to be of interest to those writing on collective\nresponsibility, they now figure importantly in the writings of Larry\nMay (1987 and 1992), Howard McGary (1986), Marilyn Friedman (Friedman\nand May 1980), and Anthony Appiah (1987), and Derrick Darby and Nyla\nBranscombe (2012 and 2014). \nIn all of these discussions, the question is whether the whole\ncommunity—or large parts of it—can be held responsible for\nthe harms produced by particular group members in cases where not all\ngroup members caused the harm directly. Is it appropriate to hold all\nGermans responsible for the deaths of extermination camp victims\nduring WWII? all Americans for the atrocities of the Viet Nam War? Can\nwe legitimately blame all men for the gender-based oppression and\nsexual violence that women experience in all societies? Can we blame\nall whites for the racist treatment of blacks in the U.S.? What about\nmembers of these groups who go out of their way to stop the harm? Are\nthey excused from blame because they tried to reform their communities\nor are they, too, responsible for the harm in question by virtue of\ntheir group membership? \nWhile the arguments made in this context tend to be tied to particular\ncases of group-based harm, they are for the most part designed either\nto establish general criteria for distributing collective\nresponsibility among group members or to demonstrate that collective\nresponsibility cannot in the end be distributed at all. The latter\narguments frequently proceed as follows: While collective entities\ngenerally act through their individual members, their actions do not\ncoincide with their members’ actions. Nor is their\nmoral agency merely the moral agency of their members or the moral\nagency of group representatives. Instead, such agency is—if it\nis to be genuinely collective moral agency—an agency\nthat is attached to the collective itself and hence not the kind of\nthing that can be distributed across group members or, for that\nmatter, attached to anything other than a collective itself. In other\nwords, such agency is the kind of thing that necessarily has\ncollectives, and not individuals, as its subject matter. \nPeter French makes such an argument himself in Individual and\nCollective Responsibility (1998). But he cautions that the\nnon-distributional character of collective responsibility does not\nmean that individual members of the group that is collectively\nresponsible for harm are themselves blameless. Indeed, he claims, many\nof these group members will be morally responsible for all sorts of\nharms that their group causes. \nThe above claim clearly makes sense if we are talking about keeping\ncollective responsibility in tact qua collective\nresponsibility in our efforts to ascribe it in practice. But we might\nwant to loosen things up here a bit and suggest that collective\nresponsibility is the basis upon which we ascribe\nresponsibility to individual group members for harm that the group\nitself caused. In other words, we might want to suggest that\nindividual group members can take collective responsibility into\nthemselves as persons, in which case collective responsibility changes\nform and becomes something closer to personal responsibility, albeit\npersonal responsibility that exists only because one’s\ncollective is responsible for harm. In many cases, this is what those\nin philosophical circles who are concerned with the question of how to\ndistribute collective responsibility seem to have in mind. How do they\nattempt to distribute collective responsibility? \nIn The Question of German Guilt, Karl Jaspers (1961)\ndistinguishes between moral guilt that is based on what one does and\nmoral guilt that is based on who one is. He argues that the latter,\nwhich he calls “metaphysical guilt”, can be distributed to\nall members of a community who stand by while their fellows produce\nharm, e.g., murder Jews. In this context, to be morally blameworthy\nfor harm is largely a matter of belonging to an “evil”\ncommunity without asserting one’s own moral powers over the\ncommunity to cleanse it of such evil. According to Jaspers,\n“[t]here exists a solidarity among men as human beings that\nmakes each as responsible for every wrong and every injustice in the\nworld, especially for crimes committed in his presence or with his\nknowledge. If I fail to do whatever I can do to prevent them, I too am\nguilty” (Jaspers 1961, p. 36). \nJaspers has several contemporary followers, including Larry May and\nJuha Raikka (Raikka 1997), who choose to express Jaspers’ notion\nof metaphysical guilt as “moral taint”, a notion that\nemphasizes, among other things, the extent to which, in Anthony\nAppiah’s terms, we are “dirtied” by association with\nour community’s harmful actions. Appiah himself is very\nreluctant to apply the language of moral taint in general and does so\nonly in particular cases where there are strong causal connections\nbetween individuals and harm. May, on the other hand, finds moral\ntaint in many places and goes as far as to tout the utilitarian\nvirtues of distributing collective responsibility widely. According to\nMay, “seeing one’s own moral status as interrelated to\nthat of one’s fellow group members will negate the tendency to\nignore the most serious moral evils: those which can only be thwarted\nby the collective efforts of the community” (May 1987, p.\n253). \nMethodological and normative individualists tend to reject the notion\nof metaphysical guilt on two related grounds. The first is that it\nsevers the link between responsibility and control, especially in\ncases where the group membership being invoked is one that individuals\ncannot possibly choose, e.g., membership in racial, ethnic or national\ncommunities (For a very interesting assessment of this claim, see:\nRadzik 2001). The second is that the metaphysical notion of guilt\nviolates the liberal ethic of what Rawls calls the “separateness\nof persons”. According to Rawls, in ascribing responsibility we\nhave to consider persons separately and focus on their own actions so\nas not to violate principles of justice, principles of justice that\nfor Rawls themselves begin with the value of discrete individuals\n(Rawls 1971). \nWhile not all liberal individualists agree with Rawls’\nparticular claims here, they do agree with Rawls that, at the very\nleast, individual group members have to be faulty in some way in order\nto be held collectively responsible for harm. Joel Feinberg’s\ntheory of group liability is often taken as a starting point of\ndiscussion in this context. According to Feinberg, in distributing\ncollective responsibility, we need to focus on two kinds of cases:\ncases in which all members of a collective share the same fault or\ncases in which all members of a collective contribute to harm but at\ndifferent levels. In both kinds of cases, Feinberg stresses, there\ndoes not need be a direct link between the individual being held\nresponsible and the harm, but there does need to be the sharing of\nfaultiness. \nFeinberg himself is willing to ascribe collective responsibility to\ngroup members for such harm in some cases, although, he makes clear,\nin doing so we need to shift our attention away from strict liability\nto a softer kind of social blame on grounds of fairness. He concerns\nhimself with three kinds of cases in particular, namely, those in\nwhich large numbers of individuals are independently at fault; those\nin which the harm is caused by a joint undertaking of numerous persons\nacting cooperatively, and those in which the harm is ascribed to a\nparticular feature of the common culture which is self-consciously\naccepted by or participated in by members of the group. Feinberg is\nwilling to accept the possibility of ascribing collective\nresponsibility in all three kinds of cases. But he cautions that we\nneed to proceed on a situation-by-situation basis, since to ascribe\ncollective responsibility in cases such as these requires not only\nthat we locate genuinely shared faults but assess various\nincommensurable dimensions of individual contributions, including\ndegrees of initiative, importance of assigned task, levels of\nauthority, etc. \nGregory Mellema (2006) provides a very useful way of assessing\ndifferent levels of individual contribution by distinguishing between\nsix different ways in which individuals can be complicit in\nwrong-doing. According to Mellema, individuals can induce or command\nothers to produce harm. They can counsel others to produce harm. They\ncan give consent to the production of harm by others. They can praise\nthese others when they produce the harm. They can fail to stop them\nfrom producing it. \nA second way of tackling the distribution question in this context\nthat does not seem to violate the principle of individual freedom is\nto look, not just at the particular role that individuals played in\ntheir community’s production of harm, but at how much freedom\nthe individuals had to distance themselves from the community that has\ndone wrong. Here we might want to use voluntariness of membership as a\ncriterion of responsibility. Jan Narveson (2002) does so himself in\nhis generally skeptical work on collective responsibility. Narveson\nargues that in thinking about the responsibility of individuals for\ngroup harms we need to be careful to distinguish between four\ndifferent kinds of groups, namely: those that are fully voluntary;\nthose that are involuntary in entrance but voluntary in exit; those\nthat are voluntary in entrance but involuntary in exit; and those that\nare voluntary in neither respect. As Narveson makes clear,\nresponsibility is diminished, if not eradicated, as we go down this\nlist. \nNarveson clearly takes an individualistic perspective here. Hence, he\nis able to address the questions of individual freedom and personal\nresponsibility with relative ease. Not surprisingly, things get\nsomewhat more complicated when we start to think about individuals,\nnot only as participating in groups, but as taking their identity from\ngroups. Karen Kovach (2006) contends that in some cases, individuals\nalign themselves with their groups—Kovach is concerned with\nethnic groups in particular—to the extent that they see the\ngroup’s agency as an extension of their own. In these cases,\nKovach contends, we can distribute collective moral responsibility to\nall members of the group because of what she calls “moral\nalignment”. \n“Moral alignment” cannot of course be a simple matter of\nidentification if it is to sustain collective moral responsibility.\nFor, identification does not implicate an individual in either the\nintentions or the actions of the group with which she identifies.\nHence, Kovach finds it necessary to insist that if individuals are to\nbe held collectively responsible for group harms that they be\nunderstood as having “acted out the view of themselves as group\nmembers” or as having “performed” the group\nidentity. \nWhile such an insistence goes far in showing how collective\nresponsibility might be distributed to all members of a group for harm\nthat the group produced in particular cases, e.g., in cases such as\ngenocide or ethnic cleansing where ethnic identity is everything, it\nis not clear that the responsibility in question is the kind that we\nnormally associate with moral responsibility. For, while “acting\nout” or “performing” a group identity may contribute\nto harm in cases such as these, it is not the same thing as\ndoing something that contributes to that harm. In other\nwords, it does not signal moral agency—unless one asserts\none’s identity knowing that it will lead to harming others, in\nwhich case it is the act of assertion, not identification, that is\ndoing the work here. \nInterestingly enough, one of the major points of agreement among those\nnow writing about collective responsibility is that responsibility\ncannot be distributed to those group members who openly resist or\nfight against their communities’ bad actions or policies. See\nhere, for example, the arguments of Joel Feinberg (1968), Peter French\n(1998), Howard McGary (1986), J. R. Lucas (1993), and Michele\nMoody-Adams (1994). While the above writers, who find collective\nresponsibility to be a compelling moral construct in general, differ\nin particular respects, they all agree that it would be wrong to\nascribe responsibility to dissenters or, in other words, that if one\ntries to fight harm one should not be held responsible for it. McGary\nmakes his own claim here in terms of what he calls the\n“dissociation condition”, according to which a person is\nexempt from collective responsibility in cases where one’s\ncommunity caused harm if he or she dissociates him or herself from the\naction of the community by opposing its bad actions or policies\n(McGary 1986). \nBut there are some who do call for the distribution of collective\nresponsibility to individuals even in cases where these individuals\nactively opposed their community’s wrong doings. Juha Raikka,\nfor example, claims that the only way that opposition can exonerate\nthose who, say, live in a society that systematically pollutes the\nenvironment or depletes resources, is if they are able, by dissenting,\nto avoid supporting the system that does these things (a condition\nthat, Raikka acknowledges, is very hard to meet). According to\nRaikka, \nRaikka claims in this context that dissenters can be morally\nblameworthy even if they cannot control the system that implicates\nthem in evil. Hence, he finds it necessary to do two things that not\nonly place him squarely in the camp of Karl Jaspers and other\nadvocates of metaphysical guilt but that are very telling with respect\nto contemporary philosophical debates about collective responsibility\nin general. The first is to subtract from the set of conventionally\ninvoked criteria of collective responsibility a criterion that the\nmajority of those now writing about collective responsibility take\nvery seriously, namely, the ability of individuals to control those\nthings (whether actions or harms) for which they are being blamed. The\nsecond is to detach moral blameworthiness from the will of discrete\nindividuals (where traditional, Kantian notions of agency place it)\nand to locate its source in the greater community of which the\nindividuals deemed guilty are ostensibly a part. \nBoth of these moves force us to acknowledge that, in the end, the\nvarious differences that exist among contemporary philosophers with\nrespect to the coherence and applicability of collective\nresponsibility as a construct have their source, not just in competing\ntheories of intentions and actions, but also in competing notions of\nmoral blameworthiness. While neither defenders nor critics of\ncollective responsibility generally take on the nature of the moral\nblameworthiness that they put at the center of our attention, they do\nmake clear that for some of them the traditional, Kantian standards of\nmoral blameworthiness still prevail and that for others the\nappropriate standards of moral blameworthiness take us beyond the\nwills of discrete individuals to the structure of guilty\ncommunities. \nMoral Responsibility has traditionally been understood to entail\nmoral—and not just social or legal—blameworthiness and\nmoral blameworthiness has, during the modern period, been understood\nto be an aspect of an individual’s own moral agency rather than\na judgment that we ourselves make on the basis of our own social and\nlegal standards. Smiley (1992) argues that this has not always been\nthe case. Hence, those who search for the conditions of moral\nresponsibility generally insist that an agent has herself\ncaused—freely willed—that for which she is being held\nmorally responsible. \nNot surprisingly, the kind of free will that is required of the modern\nnotion of moral responsibility —contra-causal freedom—is\ndifficult if not impossible to locate in practice. So, too, is the\n“softer” notion of free will preferred by\ncompatibilitists. Hence, when contemporary philosophers turn their\nattention to the conditions of moral responsibility in practice, they\nfrequently zero in on what they take to be one of free will’s\nkey components—intentionality—and ask: Under what\nconditions can we say that an agent intended X? \nSmiley (1992) argues that having an intention is neither equivalent to\nfree will nor sufficient to ground the modern notion of moral\nresponsibility (as distinct from its Aristotelian counterpart).\nSuffice it to point out here that contemporary philosophers who write\nabout collective responsibility place intentionality at the center of\ntheir attention and because they have accepted (consciously or\nunconsciously) the modern notion of moral responsibility, they\nassociate it with a unified moral self that is capable of controlling\noutcomes.  \nBut, as we have seen in Section 2, such a unified moral self might not\nbe possible in the case of collective entities. Where, then, does that\nleave us? Critics of collective responsibility assume that if such a\nunified moral self is not possible in the case of collective entities,\ncollective moral responsibility does not make sense. But such an\nassumption may be premature and in the end not warranted. For, if we\nwere to develop an alternative notion of collective moral\nresponsibility, i.e., one that does not attempt to mimic its (modern)\nindividualist counterpart, we might not have to insist on such a\nunified moral self. What might such an alternative notion of\ncollective moral responsibility look like?  \nThree things suggest that we have a lot more creative freedom in this\ncontext than we now realize. First of all, contrary to the assumptions\nof many contemporary philosophers, the modern notion of moral\nresponsibility is not moral responsibility per se. Instead,\nit is a distinctly Kantian notion of moral responsibility that has at\nleast a trio of respectable counterparts, namely, the Aristotelian,\nChristian, and pragmatist notions of moral responsibility (Smiley\n1992).  \nSecond, while many contemporary moral philosophers may in the end\nprefer the Kantian notion, we cannot dismiss these others simply\nbecause they do not live up to Kantian standards. Nor, for that\nmatter, can we designate these other notions of moral responsibility\nas non-moral or as “merely sociological” simply because\nthey do not conform to what Kantians see as “the moral\nrealm”. Instead, we have to make room for the above notions of\nmoral responsibility—and perhaps others still—in our\ndiscussions of collective responsibility.  \nThird, given its association with discrete individuals, the Kantian\nunderstanding of moral responsibility would seem to be especially out\nof place when it comes to collective responsibility. For, moral\nresponsibility as Kantians understood it is not something that we just\nhappen to associate with individual moral agents. Nor is its\nnotion of moral blameworthiness just incidently applied to\nindividuals. Instead, moral responsibility as put forward by Kantians\nis by nature associated with individual moral agents. So,\ntoo, is the notion of moral blameworthiness that grounds it. Indeed,\nthe latter is best defined as individual moral\nblameworthiness.  \nAll three points should be liberating for those who want to re-think\ncollective responsibility in ways that render it both possible and\nappropriate to groups. The first suggests that there are other notions\nof moral responsibility available to us. The second makes clear that\nthese other notions of moral responsibility cannot be dismissed simply\nbecause they do not conform to the Kantian notion of morality. The\nthird points to the need to move beyond what is by definition a notion\nof individual moral blameworthiness and to figure out how\ngroups might be understood as morally blameworthy qua groups.\n \nWhat might it mean for groups to be morally blameworthy? What kind of\ncausation would be required to sustain a notion of group moral\nblameworthiness? How might we put these two things—group moral\nblameworthiness and causation—together in this context to\nconstitute an alternative way of thinking about collective\nresponsibility that is both possible and appropriate to groups?  \nIn recent years, a small group of moral philosophers has begun to ask\nthese questions and in doing so has provided us with intriguing\nalternatives to the traditional understanding of moral responsibility.\nIn his own re-thinking of collective responsibility, Kenneth Shockley\n(2007 and 2016) sets out to replace the Kantian notion of moral\nblameworthiness with a looser notion of “being at fault”\nthat allows us to talk about a particular collective as\n“deserving of some kind of punishment apart from that meted out\nto its members for their role in harm” (p. 452). Such punishment\nmight mean “eradicating the groups themselves or dismantling\npart of them. Likewise, it might take the form of reducing the\nstrength of bonds between individual members or …\nde-institutionalizing group norms” (p. 452).  \nNeta Crawford (2007, 2013 and 2014), who also distances herself from\nthe Kantian notion of moral blameworthiness, points to the importance\nof recognizing that collectives, as distinct from their members, can\ndo morally bad things—in some cases through the actions of their\nmembers—by virtue of the particular kind of group that they are\nand how they are organized. Crawford’s particular concern here\nis with military groups whose soldiers end up killing innocents as a\nresult of either their rules of engagement or the kinds of weapons\nthat they use. What sense does it make to say that such military\ngroups, as distinct from their members, are morally blameworthy for\nthe deaths of these innocents?  \nCrawford argues that while it makes no sense to consider a military\ngroup morally guilty in the sense of having a tainted soul, it does\nmake sense to consider that it is in at least some respects a morally\nbad organization that deserves punishment. Not surprisingly, such\npunishment has to be appropriate to organizations, as distinct from\nindividuals, if it is going to ground collective moral responsibility.\nHence, Crawford chooses to view punishment here as a matter of forcing\na collective to apologize, make amends, and change.  \nThe “change” here frequently amounts to either eradicating\nparts of the group in question or changing those aspects of the group\nthat lead it to produce harm. In the case of a morally blameworthy\nmilitary group, it means “reducing the likelihood of systematic\natrocities and avoidable accidents by reviewing and revising the\nchoice of weapons and rules of engagement … and apologizing and\nmaking amends when systematic atrocity occurs” (Crawford 2007,\np. 212).  \nIn other cases, the punishment associated with a morally blameworthy\ncollective may amount to eradicating the group altogether or to\nforcing it to give up important aspects of itself. The Nazi\nregime—or any other regime whose purpose is to destroy a race of\npersons—would presumably fall into the first camp. A government\nor business club that excludes persons of color and/or women as part\nof its raison d’etre would presumably fall into the second.  \nWhat kind of causation or agency is required by moral blameworthiness\nof this kind? Since we are not talking about a Kantian notion of moral\nblameworthiness, we do not have to go as far as to insist on free will\nor focus all of our attention on the possibility of a unified moral\nself. Nor as such do we have to make sense of a group’s having\nfreely willed something bad. But, unless we want to ground moral\nblameworthiness in pure utility, we do have to assume, at the very\nleast, that the collective in question has produced the harm.\n \nNot surprisingly, not just any kind of production will do here. At the\nvery least, the collective has to play what Shockley (2007) calls an\n“eliminable role” in the production of harm—even if\nthat role is primarily one of providing the conditions under which\nmembers of the collective carry out the harmful actions. In other\nwords, the collective has to be necessary to the harm’s\nproduction by virtue of what Shockley calls its “coordinating\ncontrol” over members.  \nHow can we understand such control? In the case of corporations, we\ncan focus on the way in which the norms of the collective determine or\nshape particular paths of behavior, as well as on how incentive\nstructures and patterns of discipline lead individuals to act in\nharmful ways. Shockley finds many of these things at work in the case\nof Enron. According to him, “[t]he norms operative within the\nmembership of Enron controlled for the climate of secrecy and\ndoubt” (Shockley 2007, p. 449).  \nShockley assumes here that the collective is morally responsible for\nharm because it exerts “coordinating control” over what\nhappens in the group. But he does not excuse individual members from\nmoral blameworthiness in the process. Nor, for that matter, does he\nallow for the possibility that individual members may together bring\nabout harm without having acted in a morally blameworthy fashion\nthemselves. Indeed, he insists on individual members having acted as\nsuch if collective moral responsibility is to be coherent. In cases\nwhere collectives are morally responsible for harm, “the\ncollective serves as an enabling condition of individual blameworthy\nagents to perform harmful acts” (Shockley 2007, p. 442).  \nShockley is wise to point out that the moral responsibility of a\ncollective does not preclude the moral responsibility of its members.\nBut he may go too far in including the moral blameworthiness of\nindividual members in collective moral responsibility itself. For,\nthere are—even according to Shockley’s own criteria of\ncoordinating control—cases of collective moral responsibility in\nwhich individuals either do nothing wrong but together bring about\nharm within a collective or do harmful things but are excused from\nmoral blameworthiness by virtue of their inability to do otherwise.\nMobs are a case of the first kind. Neta Crawford’s soldiers are\na case of the second.  \nMoreover, as argued in Smiley 2010, if we are truly concerned about\ncollective moral responsibility, rather than about the moral\nresponsibility of individuals who belong to collectives, we do not\nhave to insist that individual members have performed actions that\nrender them morally blameworthy. Instead, we have to insist only that\nthe collective, by virtue of its very nature as the particular kind of\ncollective that it is, have led individual members to produce harm\nthat they could not have produced themselves. For, it is the moral\nblameworthiness of the collective itself, rather than that of its\nmembers, that constitutes collective moral responsibility.  \nWhen is it appropriate to hold a group responsible for harm? When is\nit appropriate to refrain from holding a group responsible? As things\nnow stand, we generally assume that to hold a group—or, for that\nmatter, an individual—responsible for harm is simply to\nestablish that he, she, or it is responsible for the harm, and as such\nwe do not generally find the above question especially challenging.\nIndeed, we often assume that we can answer it by simply reiterating\nthe conditions of collective responsibility itself.  \nBut to hold an agent responsible for harm is not simply to establish\nthat he, she, or it is responsible for the harm. Instead, it is to\nmake the agents’ responsibility known both to them and to the\nrest of the community or, in other words, to publicize their\nresponsibility as part of a social or legal practice of accountability\nin particular contexts with particular purposes in mind.  \nThe differences between these two things—the act of\nholding an agent responsible for harm and the agent’s\nbeing responsible—for it are worth underscoring. While\nX’s being responsible for harm is a matter of\nwhat X has done, our holding of X\nresponsible is a matter of what we do with our knowledge of\nX’s behavior. The former is ostensibly a moral fact\nabout X. The latter is an act that we ourselves perform as\npart of a social or legal practice of accountability.  \nWhen are we justified in performing such an act of accountability?\nSince holding agents responsible for harm sheds negative light on them\nand frequently results in calls for compensation and/or punishment, we\ngenerally insist on taking fairness seriously in this context\nand, in our efforts to take fairness seriously, we generally require\naccuracy with respect to the facts of responsibility. Indeed,\nwe often combine these two conditions and say that it would not be\nfair to hold an agent responsible for harm if he, she, or it was not\nreally responsible for it.  \nBut fairness is not always just a matter of factual accuracy when it\ncomes to holding groups responsible. Instead, it can be—and\noften is—a matter of making sure that we do not in our holding\nof agents responsible discriminate between equally responsible agents.\nIn other words, it can be—and often is—a matter of\ntreating like cases in the same fashion so as not to be\ndiscriminatory. Hence the emphasis that we now see being placed by\npost-war tribunals on making sure that if collective responsibility is\nascribed to particular groups it is ascribed to all groups according\nto general rules.  \nAs it turns out, we do not always treat like cases in a similar\nfashion. Nor, for that matter, do we always place fairness above all\nelse. Indeed, we sometimes choose to discriminate between cases that\nappear to be the same. Moreover, we do so in some cases on\nself-consciously consequentialist grounds that we find to be\njustified.  \nIn many of these cases, we are concerned with whether or not we can\nbring about positive consequences in the world by holding particular\ngroups responsible. (Would these groups behave better if we did? Would\nothers follow suit? Would harm be prevented?) In other cases, we are\nconcerned with consequences of a decidedly more negative sort. (Would\nholding particular groups responsible for harm lead to greater\nanimosity among groups? create resentment in the community? stand in\nthe way of peace?)  \nInterestingly enough, those who are concerned about responsibility in\nphilosophical circles are frequently hesitant to enter into a full\nblown consequentialist debate about when we should hold particular\nagents responsible in practice. (We suggest why this may be so below.)\nBut they do often make clear that they have particular consequences in\nmind when, in an off-handed fashion, they assess collective\nresponsibility in practice. In the case of individual responsibility,\nthese consequences tend to be positive and include the reinforcement\nof norms associated with moral agency. In the case of collective\nresponsibility, they tend to be both positive and negative.  \nWhile defenders of collective responsibility do not always distinguish\nbetween the consequences of holding particular groups responsible in\npractice and the value of collective responsibility per se,\nthey do make clear that we can do important things in the world by\nholding particular groups responsible for harm. Among other things, we\ncan raise consciousness among groups about what they are doing. We can\nget them to stop harming others. We can reinforce social norms that\nprevent such harm from occurring in the future. And we can make clear\nto the world that those being harmed are worth taking seriously.  \nList and Pettit (2011), as we saw in Section 2, make clear that\nholding groups responsible for particular kinds of harm not only\n“lets us discern the true contours of the moral and political\nworld we inhabit” (List and Pettit 2011, p. 185), but provides\nincentives for change among group members (p. 168), and conditions\nthem to behave better in the future (p. 157). Likewise, it can provide\nthe basis for institutional reform in cases where collective acts were\nhitherto invisible. \nWhat about the negative consequences that might follow from holding\nparticular groups responsible for harm? Not surprisingly, the most\ncommonly cited of these consequences are those associated with the\nfreeing of individuals from personal responsibility in both private\nand public life. In some cases, the negative consequences thought to\nfollow from collective responsibility are a matter of moral degeneracy\nand/or the avoidance of just punishment. In other cases, they are a\nmatter of the erosion of liberal ideals and/or threats to democratic\ngovernance.  \nNot surprisingly, these arguments have been taken in a variety of\ndirections over the years. Garrett Hardin’s early work focused\non the squashing of individual initiative associated with collective\nresponsibility (Hardin 1968). So, too, did the works of many others\nduring the Cold War. Contemporary liberals tend to be less vehement\nthan Hardin with respect to the ways in which collective\nresponsibility undermines individual moral agency. But they, too,\nworry that individuals will not take responsibility for harm that\ntheir group is being held responsible for as well. Moreover, there is\nsome historical evidence for their concerns.  \nRichard McKeon, in an essay that rarely finds its way into\ncontemporary work on collective responsibility, provides us with\nimportant insights into the ways in which the replacement of\ncollective responsibility with personal responsibility in the West was\npolitically, as well as morally, crucial to the development of\nliberalism. According to McKeon, the replacement of collective\nresponsibility with personal responsibility meant not only that\nindividuals could exercise moral agency as individuals but that the\nstate would no longer be as necessary as it once was, since\nindividuals could now take responsibility for governing themselves\n(McKeon 1957).  \nBut, of course, we cannot, on an a priori basis, treat personal and\ncollective responsibility as mutually exclusive. For, there is always\nthe possibility of bringing them together and doing so in ways that\nenhance both. Robert Goodin (Goodin 1998) suggests what such an\nintegrated system of responsibiity might look like in the context of a\nwelfare state. List and Pettit underscore how individual and\ncollective responsibility might co-exist on a more general level.\n(List and Pettit 2011, pp. 121-122)  \nOne of the most interesting critiques of the practice of collective\nresponsibility put forward by a contemporary philosopher is that of\nMark Reiff (2008). Reiff concedes that holding particular groups\nresponsible for harm can do good things in the world, e.g., deter\nthese groups from performing harmful actions in the future, aid us in\nbringing about social order more generally, and provide communities\nwith a basis for justice. But he makes clear that holding groups\nresponsible for harm can also lead to both the escalation of violence\nand the watering down of moral strictures. Indeed, he claims,\n“some of the most heinous crimes in human\nhistory—including the Nazi’s Final Solution and genocide\nin Rwanda—have been facilitated if not motivated by a belief in\ncollective responsibility” (Reiff 2008, p. 234).  \nReiff’s primary focus when discussing collective responsibility\nand violence is on what can go wrong when we hold groups responsible\nfor harm over time in contexts where each side in a conflict defines\nthe other as collectively responsible for historical wrongs. According\nto Reiff, in such cases, we are bound to encounter endless cycles of\nretaliation, as well as the presentation of murderous acts as acts of\npunishment. Moreover, we are bound to encounter these kinds of things\nnot because the actors in question lack a sense of morality but\nbecause of the particular kind of moral righteousness that claims of\ncollective responsibility allow those who want to retaliate against\ntheir enemies in the name of a higher morality.  \nSince Reiff’s focus here is on moral righteousness, we might\nexpect him to view the practice of holding groups responsible as\nbolstering morality (albeit morality of a peculiar and skewed kind).\nBut he does not do so. Instead, he argues just the opposite, namely,\nthat claims of collective responsibility can—and often\ndo—undermine both the importance of morality in general and the\neffectiveness of punishment in particular. Here his focus is primarily\non what happens when we internalize claims of collective\nresponsibility.  \nReiff argues that when we internalize claims of collective\nresponsibility, we may come to feel more responsibility—or\nresponsibility for more things—than we used to feel. But we are\nless likely to follow the dictates of morality. For, while the range\nof our responsibility has been expanded, the ties between\nresponsibility and morality have been weakened. Indeed, these ties may\nin some cases be totally severed. How might this happen?  \nReiff does not claim, as those before him did, that the practice of\ncollective responsibility allows individuals to avoid personal\nresponsibility and hence reduces both their moral agency and their\nculpability for harm. Nor does he, as his predecessors did, understand\nthe problem in question as a matter of too little personal\nresponsibility in general. Instead, he understands the problem as a\nmatter of individuals feeling responsible for harm even when they have\ndone nothing wrong. (Presumably, the moral dictates that Reiff is\nconcerned with here are those associated with an individual’s\nown actions.) According to Reiff,  \nIn the end, he concludes, “[e]mbracing collective responsibility\nundermines the very concept of responsibility itself, for it\nencourages people to disregard rather than obey the structures of\nmorality” (Reiff 2008, p. 242).  \nInterestingly enough, most of those who offer consequentialist\ncritiques of collective responsibility—and again they are almost\nalways concerned with the practice of holding groups responsible for\nharm rather than with the facts of responsibility per\nse—do so on a surprisingly general level. In other words,\nthey do not provide us with a set of criteria for thinking about the\nvalue of holding groups morally responsible in particular situations.\nBut they could do so very productively on the basis of the more\ngeneral arguments that Reiff and others provide. Moreover, they could\ndo so without violating their own agent-based approaches to moral\nresponsibility. For, as we have suggested above, being morally\nresponsible and holding others morally responsible are not the same\nthing. Nor do they have the same relationship to consequences. While\nconsequences may be irrelevant to moral responsibility itself, they\nmay be absolutely key to our choice to hold—or not to\nhold—agents morally responsible in practice. \nWhile the majority of those now writing on collective responsibility\ncontinue to focus on the kind of responsibility explored above, i.e.,\nbackward looking collective responsibility, a small but growing number\nof philosophers have chosen to focus instead on forward looking\ncollective responsibility. Two things appear to explain such a shift\nin focus. The first is the recognition that collective entities such\nas states, corporations, and movements may now be the only agents\ncapable of preventing particular kinds of suffering in the world. The\nsecond is the publication of David Miller’s National\nResponsibility and Global Justice (Miller 2007), Iris\nYoung’s Responsibility for Justice (Young 2011), and\nPeter French and Howard Weinstein’s edited collection\nForward Looking Collective Responsibility (French and\nWeinstein 2014). \nWhat is forward looking responsibility? Forward looking\nresponsibility, like its backward looking counterpart, refers to a\ncollective agent’s responsibility for a particular state of\naffairs in the world. But, unlike its backward looking counterpart, it\ndoes not make responsibility out to be a matter of having caused an\nexisting (morally problematic) state of affairs. Instead, it makes\nresponsibility out to be a matter of being morally charged\nwith—responsible for—bringing about a state of affairs\nwhich we as a community consider to be better. Hence, when we ascribe\nforward looking responsibility to a collective agent, we do not tell a\ncausal story about the agent. Instead, we specify what the agent\nshould be doing in the world. \nNot surprisingly, we often end up pointing to the particular tasks\nthat we think the agent should be carrying out and refer to these\ntasks as the agent’s responsibilities. But we need to\nbe careful here. For forward looking responsibility is not simply a\nmatter of carrying out tasks. Instead, it is a matter of being morally\ncharged with bringing about a state of affairs that is, by virtue of\nthe ascription of forward looking responsibility itself, now part of\nthe agent’s moral business. Hence, in discussions of forward\nlooking responsibility, we do not simply say of an agent that the\nagent has responsibilities X, Y, and Z. Instead, we say that the agent\nis responsible for making sure that a particular desirable state of\naffairs X, Y, or Z comes into existence. \nSince forward looking responsibility requires that an agent bring\nabout a particular state of affairs, it has a lot in common with\nbeing morally obliged to do something. But the emphasis is\ndifferent. So, too, is the level of flexibility associated with moral\nagency. In cases where we use the language of moral obligation, we\nsignal that the agent has to perform a particular act. In cases where\nwe use the language of responsibility, we allow the agent to use its\nown judgment in deciding how to bring about the desired state of\naffairs. Likewise, we charge it with exercising its judgment wisely.\n \nWhat is morally salient about forward looking collective\nresponsibility? Backward looking collective responsibility, as we have\nseen, is morally salient because of its association with\nblameworthiness. Forward looking responsibility is not completely\nremoved from considerations of blame -- we sometimes blame those who\nfail to take their responsibilities seriously -- but it is not morally\nsalient because blame sometimes enters the picture. Instead, it is\nmorally salient because we think that such responsibility may, if\ntaken seriously by those who are being held responsible, help to bring\nabout a desirable (or better) state of affairs in the world. \nThe requirements associated with forward looking collective\nresponsibility are not as steep as those associated with its backward\nlooking counterpart. Nor are they as metaphysical. For, unlike its\nbackward looking counterpart, forward looking collective\nresponsibility is not designed to capture an agent’s will.\nInstead, it is designed to distribute moral labor. Hence, while\nforward looking collective responsibility only works with purposeful\nagents, it does not require either a “collective mind” or\nthat an agent be able to form “we intentions”. Instead, it\nrequires only that the agent be able to do something in the\nworld and take responsibility for making things happen. \nWhile forward looking collective responsibility is thus not saddled\nwith controversial metaphysical conditions in the way that its\nbackward looking counterpart is, it is not without its own\ncontroversies. In some cases, these controversies are about what kinds\nof groups are capable of forward looking collective responsibility.\nBill Wringe (Wringe 2014) and Felix Pinket (Pinket 2014) cover these\ncontroversies nicely. In other cases, they are about how — on\nwhat normative basis — we can ascribe forward collective looking\nresponsibility in practice. What principles should we invoke to do so?\nHow should we order these principles? \nInterestingly enough, not everyone thinks that such principles are\nnecessary. Indeed, a few key figures in the field still assume that\nforward looking (remedial) responsibility is grounded in causal\nresponsibility for the harm now deemed in need of a remedy. David\nLyons (Lyons 2004) feels comfortable assuming that because the U.S.\nwas causally responsibility for poverty and racism in the past, it now\nhas a responsibility for doing everything that it can to create\nopportunities for the poor and minorities. David Schmidtz (Schmidtz\n1998), who, in contrast to Lyons, takes the poor to be causally\nresponsible for many of their own problems, also moves directly from\ncausal to remedial responsibility. So, too, does Iris Young (Young\n2011). \nBut, again, we need to be careful. For, forward looking (remedial)\nresponsibility is not ascribed for the purpose of gauging moral agency\nper se. Instead, it is ascribed for the purpose of ensuring the\nsuccess of a particular, morally justifiable, project, e.g.,\nalleviating poverty, hunger, or racism. Hence, when it comes to\nforward looking responsibility, we need to think about who is in the\nbest position to do something about the harm, and when we do, as\nRobert Goodin (1998) points out, we may—and probably\nwill—discover in some cases that the agent who caused the harm\nis not the agent who is now able to remedy it in practice. \nNone of this suggests that we should abandon judgments of causal\nresponsibility altogether when ascribing forward looking\nresponsibility. Indeed, as we suggest shortly, such judgments may\nbecome relevant to matters of fairness in ascribing remedial\nresponsibility. But it does suggest that we cannot move directly from\ncausal to remedial responsibility, i.e., ground the latter exclusively\nin the former. Likewise, it does suggest that we need intermediary\nconsiderations. Carol Rovane (Rovane 2014), Tracy Isaacs (Isaacs 2011;\nIsaacs 2014), Ludger Jansen (Jansen 2014), Derrick Darby and Nyla\nBranscombe (Darby and Branscombe, 2014) and Marion Smiley (Smiley\n2014) all make this clear from their own theoretical perspectives. \nHow, then, are we to ascribe forward looking collective responsibility\nin practice? At the very least, we need to make room for various kinds\nof practical judgments, including those that draw attention to who is\nbest able to remedy the harm in question and at what cost. But such\npractical judgments, which are very important, are not the only\nnon-causal matters that we need to take into consideration when\nascribing forward looking responsibility. Indeed, as recent debates\nconcerning our responsibility for remedying health care problems at\nhome, starvation abroad, and environmental disasters everywhere\nattest, judgments about the relative value of our projects in the\nworld are also crucial. So, too, are judgments about fairness and\nobligation. \nNot surprisingly, we incorporate judgments about relative value\nprimarily in cases where we cannot pursue all of our projects —\neradicating hunger, bringing up healthy children, creating jobs,\nreversing global warming — at once or even at all. But we make\nthese judgments in other kinds of cases as well, including those in\nwhich a supposed cause of harm, say, capitalism, is also the cause of\nsomething that we value. In these cases, we may think that our choice\nto focus on a particular state of affairs is uncontroversial. But it\nis in fact steeped in our own priorities. \nTake, for example, Young’s ascriptions of responsibility for\nalleviating poverty, hunger, and violence around the world cited\nabove. Young may be correct that capitalism (or at least unregulated\ncapitalism) is causally responsible for these problems. (There would\nof course be other agents to consider as well.) But if she is going to\ngo on to ascribe remedial responsibility to those who benefit from\ncapitalism — which is what she is concerned to do — then\nshe has to take into consideration that capitalism (or at least\nregulated capitalism) may also be causally responsible for things in\nthe world that we value, e.g., significant improvements in health\ncare, education, and food production, as well as the separation of\neconomic from political power. \nMoreover, she has to take these things into consideration because of\nthe very nature of remedial responsibility itself as organized and\ndistributed across cases. Remedial responsibility, as we have seen, is\nattached to a particular project. (Who, we ask, is responsible for\ncarrying out this project?) But it cannot be formulated in isolation.\nInstead, it has to be formulated with an eye to our other projects.\nFor, we are limited with respect to both moral energy and resources.\nHence, we have to prioritize our projects as well as to coordinate our\nascriptions of remedial responsibility across them. Likewise, we have\nto be aware of the priorities that others, e.g., Young, incorporate\ninto their own ascriptions of remedial responsibility. \nAll of this is to suggest that if we want to ascribe remedial\nresponsibility in a justifiable fashion — in a way that avoids\narbitrariness and bias — we will have to argue openly about the\nrelative value of our projects and proceed with an overview in mind.\nWhat projects, we will have to ask, are most valuable to us and how do\nthey rank in importance with respect to other projects? Whose needs\nand interests are being taken into consideration by these projects?\nHow might we ensure that everyone’s needs and interests are\ntaken into consideration? What is the relative cost of the projects in\nquestion and how does cost itself rank in importance here? \nRobert Goodin defends this kind of pragmatic approach to forward\nlooking collective responsibility in his arguments for why the U.S.\nshould be held responsible for providing the poor with welfare\nbenefits. In distancing himself from the practice of blame, he\nwrites: \nThe pragmatic approach to forward looking collective responsibility\ngestured to here is very valuable (and sound). But we cannot treat it\nin isolation from other approaches. In other words, we cannot simply\nreplace causal responsibility with capacity for remedying\na problem as a basis for ascribing forward looking\nresponsibility. Instead, we have to incorporate other values and\nprinciples into our ascriptions of responsibility. What might they be?\nAs things now stand, the value of fairness is frequently invoked, if\nnot thoroughly explored, in this context. So, too, are the values of\ncitizenship and collective obligation, as well as the principle of a\nsocial contract. \nAdmittedly, those who invoke the value of fairness in ascribing\nforward looking responsibility do not always have the same thing in\nmind by the term. Alexander Brown [2009] incorporates judgments about\nwho caused harm into his arguments about who can fairly be held\nresponsible for remedying such harm and, in doing so, treats fairness\nas a response to causal agency. Brown’s concern is with the\nbehavioral lapses of the poor in a welfare state. \nMichael Walzer also considers fairness to be very important to\nascriptions of forward looking collective responsibility in a welfare\nstate. But he does not consider fairness in this context to rest on\nconsiderations of who caused harm. Instead, he considers it to rest on\nnorms of communal membership. According to Walzer, a fair distribution\nof responsibilities in a welfare state will always come down to what\nwe owe each other as members of a community—which, from his\nperspective, translates into all of those things that will make\ncommunal membership possible among those in the community, e.g.,\nfinancial security, health care, education, peace, and security,\nregardless of whether members caused harm to themselves. (Walzer\n2008) \nChristian Neuhauser, who underscores the importance of distributive\njustice in the organization of forward looking collective\nresponsibility, concurs on the importance of fairness to the\nascription of remedial responsibility. But he takes things in a\nsomewhat different direction from both Brown and Walzer by treating\nfairness as a matter of doing one’s fair share.\nMoreover, Neuhauser places fairness in the context of various\ncollective action scenarios. Hence, he is naturally led to talk about\nfairness as a motivating force. “The motivation of\nagents to embrace a forward looking responsibility also depends on\nwhether other actors contribute their fair share”. (Neuhauser\n2014, p. 246) \nWhile the value of fairness is commonly invoked by those concerned to\nlocate criteria for ascribing (or organizing or distributing) forward\nlooking collective responsibility in practice, it is not the only\nvalue or principle in play. Indeed, many of those in the field\ncontinue to look to collective obligations as a basis for remedial\nresponsibility. In some cases, the collective obligations in question\nare thought to be built into the collective itself. (Miller 2007) In\nother cases, they are thought to derive from various other norms of\nmoral and political life. \nIn her discussion of forward looking collective responsibility and the\nprospects of war, Neta Crawford locates the source of these\nobligations in the sphere of citizenship. According to Crawford,\n“ordinary citizens have a collective moral and political\nresponsibility to participate in decisions about wars that are\nundertaken by their governments and they have a responsibility to\nprotest unjust wars or immoral conduct during wars.” (Crawford,\n2014, p. 141) Moreover, they have such responsibility, according to\nCrawford, by virtue of their identity as citizens in a democratic\ncommunity. Bill Wringe takes such an analysis to the global level\n(Wringe 2014), as do many others in the field of global justice,\nincluding David Miller (2007). \nDerrick Darby and Nyla Branscombe, in their work on responsibility for\novercoming social, political, and economic inequality, choose to look,\nnot to the identities of democratic citizens, but to the kinds of\nsocial, political, and economic institutions that democratic citizens\nwould choose within a Rawlsian social contract, as a basis for\nascribing remedial responsibility. In doing so, they manage not only\nto bring both shared interests and rational choice together, but, in\ndoing so, to make clear what is unique about forward looking\nresponsibility. \nTracy Isaacs, who develops a full blown account of collective\nobligations and their relationship to collective responsibility\n[Isaacs 2011 and 2014], points to many of the norms cited above and\nemphasizes the centrality of identity. But, interestingly enough, she\ndoes not steer clear of causal responsibility in doing so. Instead,\nshe offers a sophisticated view of how causal responsibility helps\nshape our criteria for ascribing remedial responsibility fairly. \nAll of these arguments underscore the cluster of values and principles\nthat go into ascribing forward looking collective responsibility in\npractice. Isaac’s work in particular provides a way of bringing\ncausal responsibility back into play without either blurring the\ndistinction between backward and forward looking responsibility or\ntreating the latter as a natural extension of the former. How, if at\nall, should we prioritize all of these values, principles, and causal\njudgments, in ascribing remedial responsibility? It has been suggested\n(Smiley 2014) that instead of treating one of them as primary and the\nothers as secondary we bring all of them together into a pluralistic\nnormative account of forward looking collective responsibility.
