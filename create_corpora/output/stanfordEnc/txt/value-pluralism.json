This entry\nis concerned with moral pluralism—the view that there are many\ndifferent moral values.\n\n\n\nMoral value pluralism should be distinguished from political\npluralism. Political pluralism, which, like moral value pluralism, is\noften referred to as ‘value pluralism’, is a view\nassociated with political liberalism. Political pluralism is concerned\nwith the question of what sort of restrictions governments can put on\npeople’s freedom to act according to their values. One version\nof political pluralism is based on moral value pluralism, claiming\nthat there are irreducibly plural moral values and that this justifies\na liberal political system. (See Isaiah Berlin, 1969; George Crowder,\n2002; William Galston, 2002, and for a more detailed discussion of\nthis see the entry on\n Isaiah Berlin).  Political Liberalism need\nnot be based on value pluralism: a defence of toleration of different\nvalue systems need not rely on the claim that there are plural moral\nvalues. We shall leave political pluralism aside for the purposes of\nthis entry, and concentrate on moral value pluralism.\n\n It is also worth emphasising that moral value pluralism does not\nentail relativism. The idea is not that all values or value systems\nare equally true. Value pluralism is independent of any particular\nmeta-ethical view. It is a claim about the normative domain: about\nwhat value looks like. \n\n\n\nCommonsensically we talk about lots of\ndifferent values—happiness, liberty, friendship, and so\non. The question about pluralism in moral theory is whether these\napparently different values are all reducible to one supervalue, or\nwhether we should think that there really are several distinct\nvalues.\n\n\nThere are different ways that value might be conceived, but\nthe debate about pluralism should be able to cut across different\nsorts of moral theory. Traditionally, moral philosophers recognize\nthree different ways of thinking about morality: the deontological\nway, the consequentialist way, and the virtue ethics way, although there\nis debate about the cogency of these\n distinctions.[1]\nThe term ‘value’ as it appears in ‘value\npluralism’ is neutral between these three\ntheories. Deontologists think of morality as being fundamentally about\nmoral principles. Thus the question of whether a deontological theory\nis pluralist is a question about how many fundamental principles there\nare. The consequentialist, by contrast, tends to see value as being\nrealized by goods in the world, such as friendship, knowledge, beauty\nand so on, and the question of pluralism is thus a question about how\nmany fundamental goods there are. Virtue ethicists focus on how agents\nshould be, so are interested both in principles of action (or\nmotivation) and the pursuit of goods, such as friendship.\n\n\n\n\nDeontologists can clearly be monists or pluralists. Kant can be\nunderstood as a monist—arguing that there is one overarching\nprinciple, and that all other principles are derived from it. Ross, by\ncontrast, is a  pluralist, because he thinks that\nthere is a plurality of prima facie duties. (See Kant (1948), Ross\n(1930).)[2]\n\n \n\nMany utilitarians are monists, arguing that there is only one\nfundamental value and that is well-being or pleasure or happiness, or\nsomething of that sort. In other words, some utilitarians are\ncommitted to hedonism.  Monist utilitarians must claim that all other\nputative values, such as friendship, knowledge and so on, are only\ninstrumental values, which are valuable in so far as they contribute\nto the foundational value. But utilitarians need not be\nmonists. Amartya Sen, for example, argues that utilitarians can take a\n‘vector view of utility’, according to which there are\ndifferences in the qualities as well of the quantites of utility in\ngoods in the world. According to Sen, we should interpet Mill as a\npluralist in this way. (I return to Mill below: it is not entirely\nclear how we should understand his view). Sen points out that desire\nsatisfaction theorists can be pluralists too. Just as different sorts\nof pleasure might have different sorts of value, so different desires\nmight have different sorts of value. (Sen, 1981). Even utilitarians\nwho claim that the value to be maximized is well-being can be\npluralist: a prominent view of well-being is that well-being itself is\nplural, an objective list of things that are fundamentally\nplural. (See Finnis 1980; Griffin 1986; for recent defences see\nFletcher, 2013, Lin, 2014). Another reason to think that hedonistic\nutilitarians should be pluralists is that it seems essential to say\nsomething about the disvalue of pain. As Shelly Kagan points out\n(2014), we need an account of ill-being in addition to an account of\nwell-being. \n\n\nIn what follows I will be as neutral as possible between different\ntheoretical approaches to morality, and will focus on the debate\nbetween monists and pluralists. Monists claim that there is only one\nultimate value.  Pluralists argue that there really are several\ndifferent values, and that these values are not reducible to each\nother or to a supervalue. Monism has the advantage of relative\nsimplicity: once it has been determined what the supervalue is\n(whether we think of the super value in terms of the goods approach or\nany other approach) much of the hard work has been done. On the other\nhand, monism may be too simple: it may not capture the real texture of\nour ethical lives. However, pluralism faces the difficulty of\nexplaining how different fundamental values relate to each other, and\nhow they can be compared.\n\n \n\n\n\nIt is important to clarify the levels at which a moral theory might be\npluralistic. Let us distinguish between two levels of pluralism:\nfoundational and non-foundational. Foundational pluralism is the view\nthat there are plural moral values at the most basic level—that\nis to say, there is no one value that subsumes all other values, no\none property of goodness, and no overarching principle of\naction. Non-foundational pluralism is the view that there are plural\nvalues at the level of choice, but these apparently plural values can\nbe understood in terms of their contribution to one more fundamental\nvalue.[3] \nJudith Jarvis Thomson, a foundational pluralist, argues that when we\nsay that something is good we are never ascribing a property of\ngoodness, rather we are always saying that the thing in question is\ngood in some way. If we say that a fountain pen is good we mean\nsomething different from when we say that a logic book is good, or a\nfilm is good. As Thomson puts it, all goodness is a goodness in a\nway. Thomson focusses her argument on Moore, who argues that when we\nsay ‘x is good’ we do not mean ‘x\nis conducive to pleasure’, or ‘x is in accordance\nwith a given set of rules’ and nor do we mean anything else that\nis purely descriptive. As Moore points out, we can always query\nwhether any purely descriptive property really is good—so he\nconcludes that goodness is simple and\nunanalyzable.[4]\nMoore is thus a foundational monist, he thinks that there is one\nnon-natural property of goodness, and that all good things are good in\nvirtue of having this property. Thomson finds this preposterous.  In\nThomson’s own words:\n \n\nAccording to Thomson there is a fundamental plurality of ways of being\ngood. We cannot reduce them to something they all have in common, or\nsensibly claim that there is a disjunctive property of goodness (such\nthat goodness is ‘goodness in one of the various ways’. Thomson\nargues that that could not be an interesting property as each disjunct\nis truly different from every other disjunct. Thomson (1997), p. 277).\nThomson is thus a foundational pluralist—she does not think\nthat there is any one property of value at the most basic\nlevel.  \n\nW.D. Ross is a foundational pluralist in a rather complex way. Most\nstraightforwardly, Ross thinks that there are several prima facie\nduties, and there is nothing that they all have in common: they are\nirreducibly plural. This is the aspect of Ross’s view that is referred\nto with the phrase, ‘Ross-style pluralism’. However, Ross also thinks\nthat there are goods in the world (justice and pleasure, for example),\nand that these are good because of some property they share. Goodness\nand rightness are not reducible to one another, so Ross is a pluralist\nabout types of value as well as about principles. \n\nWriters do not always make the distinction between foundational\nand other forms of pluralism, but as well as Thomson and Ross, at least Bernard\nWilliams (1981), Charles Taylor (1982), Charles Larmore (1987), John\nKekes (1993), Michael Stocker (1990 and 1997), David Wiggins (1997)\nand Christine Swanton (2001) are all committed to foundational\npluralism. \n\nNon-foundational pluralism is less radical—it posits a plurality\nof bearers of value. In fact, almost everyone accepts that there are\nplural bearers of value. This is compatible with thinking that there\nis only one ultimate value. G.E.  Moore (1903), Thomson’s\ntarget, is a foundational monist, but he accepts that there are\nnon-foundational plural values. Moore thinks that there are many\ndifferent bearers of value, but he thinks that there is one property\nof goodness, and that it is a simple non-natural property that bearers\nof value possess in varying degrees. Moore is clear that comparison\nbetween plural goods proceeds in terms of the amount of goodness they\nhave.  \n\nThis is not to say that the amount of goodness is always a matter of\nsimple addition. Moore thinks that there can be organic unities, where\nthe amount of goodness contributed by a certain value will vary\naccording to the combination of values such as love and\nfriendship. Thus Moore’s view is pluralist at the level of\nordinary choices, and that is not without interesting consequences. (I\nshall return to the issue of how a foundational monist like Moore can\naccount for organic unities in section 2.1.)  \n\nMill, a classic utilitarian, could be and often has\nbeen interpreted as thinking that there are irreducibly different\nsorts of pleasure. Mill argues that there are higher and lower\npleasures, and that the higher pleasures (pleasures of the intellect\nas opposed to the body) are superior, in that higher pleasures can\noutweigh lower pleasures regardless of the quantity of the latter. As\nMill puts it: “It is quite compatible with the principle of utility to\nrecognize the fact, that some kinds of pleasure are more desirable and\nmore valuable than others.” (2002, p. 241). On the foundational\npluralist interpretation of Mill, there is not one ultimate good, but\ntwo (at least): higher and lower pleasures. Mill goes on to give an\naccount of what he means: \n\nThe passage is ambiguous, it is not clear what role the expert\njudges play in the theory. On the pluralist interpretation of this\npassage we must take Mill as intending the role of the expert judges\nas a purely heuristic device: thinking about what such people\nwould prefer is a way of discovering which pleasures are higher and\nwhich are lower, but the respective values of the pleasure is\nindependent of the judges’ judgment. On a monist interpretation we\nmust understand Mill as a preference utilitarian: the\npreferences of the judges determine value.  On this interpretation\nthere is one property of value (being preferred by expert judges) and\nmany bearers of value (whatever the\n judges\n prefer).[5] \n\nBefore moving on, it is worth noting that a theory might be\nfoundationally monist in its account of what values there are, but not\nrecommend that people attempt to think or make decisions on the basis\nof the supervalue. A distinction between decision procedures and\ncriteria of right has become commonplace in moral philosophy. For\nexample, a certain form of consequentialism has as its criterion of\nright action: act so as to maximize good consequences. This might\ninvite the complaint that an agent who is constantly trying to\nmaximize good consequences will often, in virtue of that fact, fail to\ndo so.  Sometimes concentrating too hard on the goal will make it less\nlikely that the goal is achieved. A distinction between decision\nprocedure and right action can provide a response—the\nconsequentialist can say that the criterion of right action, (act so\nas to maximize good consequences) is not intended as a decision\nprocedure—the agent should use whichever decision procedure is\nmost likely to result in success. If, then, there is some attraction\nor instrumental advantage from the point of view of a particular\ntheory to thinking in pluralist terms, then it is open to that theory\nto have a decision procedure that deals with apparently plural values,\neven if the theory is monist in every other way.\n [6] \n\nOne final clarification about different understandings of pluralism\nought to be made. There is an ambiguity between the name for a group\nof values and the name for one unitary value. There are really two\nproblems here: distinguishing between the terms that refer to groups\nand the terms that refer to individuals (a merely linguistic problem)\nand defending the view that there really is  a candidate for a\nunitary value (a metaphysical problem). The linguistic problem comes\nabout because in natural language we may use a singular term as\n‘shorthand’: conceptual analysis may reveal that surface\ngrammar does not reflect the real nature of the concept. For example,\nwe use the term ‘well-being’ as if it refers to one single\nthing, but it is not hard to see that it may \nnot. ‘Well-being’ may be a term that we use to refer to\na group of things such as pleasure, health, a sense of achievement and\nso on. A theory that tells us that well-being is the only value may only\nbe nominally monist. The metaphysical question is more\ndifficult, and concerns whether there are any genuinely unitary values\nat all. \n\nThe metaphysical question is rather different for naturalist and\nnon-naturalist accounts of value. On Moore’s non-naturalist account,\ngoodness is a unitary property but it is not a natural \nproperty: it is not empirically available to us, but is known by a\nspecial faculty of intuition. It is very clear that Moore thinks that\ngoodness is a genuinely unitary property:  The question of whether there could be such a thing is no more\neasy or difficult than any question about the existence of non-natural\nentities. The issue of whether the entity is genuinely unitary\nis not an especially difficult part of that issue. \n\nBy contrast, naturalist views do face a particular difficulty in\ngiving an account of a value that is genuinely unitary.  On the goods\napproach, for example, the claim must be that there is one good that\nis genuinely singular, not a composite of other goods. So for example,\na monist hedonist must claim that pleasure really is just one\nthing. Pleasure is a concept we use to refer to something we take to\nbe in the natural world, and conceptual analysis may or may not\nconfirm that pleasure really is one thing. Perhaps, for example, \nwe refer both to intellectual and sensual experiences as\npleasure. Or, take another good often suggested by proponents of the\ngoods approach to value, friendship. It seems highly unlikely that\nthere is one thing that we call friendship, even if there are good\nreasons to use one umbrella concept to refer to all those different\nthings. Many of the plausible candidates for the good seem plausible\nprecisely because they are very broad terms. If a theory is to be\nproperly monist then, it must have an account of the good that is\nsatisfactorily unitary. \n\nThe problem applies to the deontological approach to value too. It is\noften relatively easy to determine whether a principle is really two\nor more principles in disguise—the presence of a conjunction\nor a disjunction, for example, is a clear giveaway.  However,\nprinciples can contain terms that are unclear. Take for example\na deontological theory that tells us to respect friendship. As mentioned previously,\nit is not clear whether there is one thing that is friendship or more\nthan one, so it is not clear whether this is one principle about one\nthing, or one principle about several things, or whether it is really\nmore than one principle. \n\nQuestions about what makes individuals individuals and what the\nrelationship is between parts and wholes have been discussed in the\ncontext of metaphysics but these issues have not been much discussed in the\nliterature on pluralism and monism in moral philosophy. However, these issues are\nimplicit in discussions of the well-being, nature of friendship and pleasure, and\nin the literature on Kant’s categorical imperative, or on Aristotelian\naccounts of eudaimonea. Part of an investigation into the nature of\nthese things is an investigation into whether there really is one\nthing or not. [7] \n\nThe upshot of this brief discussion is that monists must be able to\ndefend their claim that the value they cite is genuinely one\nvalue. There may be fewer monist theories than it first\nappears. Further, the monist must accept the implications of a\ngenuinely monist view. As Ruth Chang points out, (2015, p. 24) the\nsimpler the monist’s account of the good is, the less likely it\nis that the monist will be able to give a good account of the various\ncomplexities in choice that seem an inevitable part of our experience\nof value. But on the other hand, if the monist starts to admit that\nthe good is complex, the view gets closer and closer to being a\npluralist view.\n \nHowever, the dispute between monists and pluralists is not merely\nverbal: there is no prima facie reason to think that there are no\ngenuinely unitary properties, goods or principles.   \n\nIf values are plural, then choices between them will be complex.\nPluralists have pressed the point that choices are complex, and so we\nshould not shy away from the hypothesis that values are plural. In\nbrief, the attraction of pluralism is that it seems to allow for the\ncomplexity and conflict that is part of our moral experience. We do\nnot experience our moral choices as simple additive\npuzzles. Pluralists have argued that there are incommensurabilities\nand discontinuities in value comparisons, value remainders (or\nresidues) when choices are made, and complexities in appropriate\nresponses to value. Recent empirical work confirms\nthat our ethical experience is of apparently irreducible plural\nvalues. (See Gill and Nichols, 2008.)  \n\nJohn Stuart Mill suggested that there are higher and lower pleasures\n(Mill, 2002, p. 241), the idea being that the value of higher and lower\npleasures is measured on different scales. In other words, there are\ndiscontinuities in the measurement of value. As mentioned previously, it is unclear\nwhether we should interpret Mill as a foundational pluralist, but the\nnotion of higher and lower pleasures is a very useful one to\nillustrate the attraction of thinking that there are discontinuities\nin value. The distinction between higher and lower pleasures allows us\nto say that no amount of lower pleasures can outweigh some amount of\nhigher pleasures.  As Mill puts it, it is better to be an unhappy\nhuman being than a happy pig. In other words, the distinction allows\nus to say that there are discontinuities in value addition. As James\nGriffin (1986, p. 87) puts it: “We do seem, when informed, to rank a\ncertain amount of life at a very high level above any amount of life\nat a very low level.”  Griffin’s point is that there are\ndiscontinuities in the way we rank values, and this suggests that\nthere are different\n values.[8]\n The phenomenon of\ndiscontinuities in our value rankings seems to support pluralism: if\nhigher pleasures are not outweighed by lower pleasures, that suggests\nthat they are not the same sort of thing. For if they were just the\nsame sort of thing, there seems to be no reason why lower pleasures\nwill not eventually outweigh higher pleasures.\n \n\nThe most extreme form of discontinuity is incommensurability or\nincomparability, when two values cannot be ranked at\nall. Pluralists differ on whether pluralism entails\nincommensurabilities, and on what incommensurability entails for the\npossibility of choice. Griffin denies that pluralism entails\nincommensurability (Griffin uses the term incomparability) whereas\nother pluralists embrace incommensurability, but deny that it entails\nthat rational choice is impossible. Some pluralists accept that there\nare sometimes cases where incommensurability precludes rational\nchoice.  We shall return to these issues in Section 4. \n\nMichael Stocker (1990) and Bernard Williams (1973 and 1981) and others\nhave argued that it can be rational to regret the outcome of a correct\nmoral choice. That is,  even when the right choice has been made,\nthe rejected option can reasonably be regretted, and so the choice\ninvolves a genuine value conflict. This seems strange if the options\nare being compared in terms of a supervalue. How can we regret having\nchosen more rather than less of the same thing? Yet the phenomenon\nseems undeniable, and pluralism can explain it. If there are plural\nvalues, then one can rationally regret not having chosen something which\nthough less good, was different. \n\nIt is worth noting that the pluralist argument is not that all cases\nof value conflict point to pluralism. There may be conflicts because\nof ignorance, for example, or because of irrationality, and these do\nnot require positing plural values. Stocker argues that there are (at\nleast) two sorts of value conflict that require plural values. The\nfirst is conflict that involves choices between doing things at\ndifferent times. Stocker argues that goods become different values in\ndifferent temporal situations, and the monist cannot accommodate this\nthought. The other sort of case (which Williams also points to) is\nwhen there is a conflict between things that have different advantages\nand disadvantages. The better option may be better, but it does not\n‘make up for’ the lesser option, because it isn’t the same\nsort of thing. Thus there is a remainder—a moral value that is\nlost in the choice, and that it is rational to regret.   \n\nBoth Martha Nussbaum (1986) and David Wiggins (1980) have argued for\npluralism on the grounds that only pluralism can explain akrasia, or\nweakness of will. An agent is said to suffer from weakness of will\nwhen she knowingly chooses a less good option over a better one. On\nthe face of it, this is a puzzling thing to do—why would\nsomeone knowingly do what they know to be worse? A pluralist has a\nplausible answer—when the choice is between two different\nsorts of value, the agent is preferring A to B, rather than preferring\nless of A to more of A. Wiggins explains the akratic choice by\nsuggesting that the agent is ‘charmed’ by some aspect of\nthe choice, and is swayed by that to choose what she knows to be worse\noverall (Wiggins 1980, p. 257). However, even Michael Stocker, the arch\npluralist, does not accept that this argument works. As Stocker points\nout, Wiggins is using a distinction between a cognitive and an\naffective element to the choice, and this distinction can explain\nakrasia on a monist account of value too. Imagine that a monist\nhedonist agent is faced with a choice between something that will give\nher more pleasure and something that will give her less pleasure. The\ncognitive aspect to the choice is clear—the agent knows that\none option is more pleasurable than the other, and hence on her theory\nbetter. However, to say that the agent believes that more pleasure is\nbetter is not to say that she will always be attracted to the option\nthat is most pleasurable. She may, on occasion, be attracted to the\noption that is more unusual or interesting. Hence she may act\nakratically because she was charmed by some aspect of the less good\nchoice—and as Stocker says, there is no need to posit plural\nvalues to make sense of this—being charmed is not the same as\nvaluing. (Stocker 1990, p.219). \n\nAnother argument for pluralism starts from the observation that there\nare many and diverse appropriate responses to value. Christine Swanton\n(2003, ch. 2) and Elizabeth Anderson (1993) both take this line. As\nSwanton puts it: \n\nThe crucial thought is that there are various bases of moral\nresponsiveness, and these bases are irreducibly plural. A monist could\nargue that there are different appropriate responses to value, but the\nmonist would have to explain why there are different appropriate\nresponses to the same value. Swanton’s point is that the only\nexplanation the monist has is that different degrees of value merit\ndifferent responses. According to Swanton, this does not capture what\nis really going on when we appropriately honor or respect a value\nrather than promoting it. Anderson and Swanton both argue that the\ncomplexity of our responses to value can only be explained by a\npluralistic theory. \n\nElizabeth Anderson argues that it is a mistake to understand moral\ngoods on the maximising model. She uses the example of parental love\n(Anderson 1997, p. 98). Parents should not see their love for their\nchildren as being directed towards an “aggregate child\ncollective”. Such a view would entail that trade offs were\npossible, that one child could be sacrificed for another. On\nAnderson’s view we can make rational choices between conflicting\nvalues without ranking values: “…choices concerning those\ngoods or their continued existence do not generally require that we\nrank their values on a common scale and choose the more valuable good;\nthey require that we give each good its due” (Anderson 1997,\np. 104).\n\n \n\nI began the last section by saying that if foundational values are\nplural, then choices between them will be complex. It is clear that\nour choices are complex. However, it would be invalid to conclude from\nthat that values are plural—the challenge for monists is to\nexplain how they too can make sense of the complexity of our value\nchoices.   \n\nOne way for monists to make sense of complexity in value choice is to\npoint out that there are different bearers of value, and this makes a\nbig difference to the experience of choice. (See Hurka, 1996; Schaber,\n1999; Klocksiem 2011). Here is the challenge to monism in Michael\nStocker’s words (Stocker, 1990, p. 272): “[if monism is\ntrue] there is no ground for rational conflict because the better\noption lacks nothing that would be made good by the lesser.” In\nother words, there are no relevant differences between the better and\nworse options except that the better option is better. Thomas Hurka\nobjects that there can be such differences. For example, in a choice\nbetween giving five units of pleasure to A and ten units\nto B, the best option (more pleasure for B) involves\ngiving no pleasure at all to A. So there is something to\nrationally regret, namely, that A had no pleasure. The\nargument can be expanded to deal with all sorts of choice situation:\nin each situation,  a monist can say something sensible about an\nunavoidable loss, a loss that really is a loss. If, of two options one\nwill contribute more basic value, the monist must obviously choose\nthat one. But the lesser of the options may contribute value via\npleasure, while the superior option contributes value via knowledge,\nand so there is a loss in choosing the option with the greater value\ncontribution—a loss in pleasure— and it is rational for us\nto regret this. \n\nThere is one difficulty with this answer. The loss described by Hurka\nis not a moral loss, and so the regret is not moral regret. In Hurka’s\nexample, the relevant loss is that A does not get any\npleasure. The agent doing the choosing may be rational to regret this\nif she cares about A, or even if she just feels sorry for\nA, but there has been no moral loss, as ‘pleasure for\nA’ as opposed to pleasure itself is not a moral\nvalue. According to the view under consideration, pleasure itself is\nwhat matters morally, and so although A’s pleasure matters\nqua pleasure, the moral point of view takes B’s pleasure into\naccount in just the same way, and there is nothing to regret, as there\nis more pleasure than there would otherwise have been.  Stocker and\nWilliams would surely insist that the point of their argument was not\njust that there is a loss, but that there is a moral loss. The monist\ncannot accommodate that point, as the monist can only consider the\nquantity of the value, not its distribution, and so we are at an\nimpasse. \n\nHowever, the initial question was whether the monist has succeeded in\nexplaining the phenomenon of ‘moral regret’, and perhaps\nHurka has done that by positing a conflation of moral and non-moral\nregret in our experience. From our point of view, there is regret, and\nthe monist can explain why that is without appealing to\nirrationality. On the other hand the monist cannot appeal to anything\nother than quantity of value in appraising the morality of the\nsituation. So although Hurka is clearly right in so far as he is\nsaying that a correct moral choice can be regretted for non-moral\nreasons, he can go no further than that. \n\nAnother promising strategy that the monist can use in order to explain\nthe complexity in our value choices is the appeal to\n‘diminishing marginal value’. The value that is added to\nthe sum by a source of value will tend to diminish after a certain\npoint—this phenomenon is known as diminishing marginal value\n(or, sometimes, diminishing marginal utility). Mill’s higher and lower\npleasures, which seem to be plural values, might be accommodated by\nthe monist in this way. The monist makes sense of discontinuities in\nvalue by insisting on the distinction between sources of value, which\nare often ambiguously referred to as ‘values’, and the super\nvalue. Using a monist utilitarian account of value, we can distinguish\nbetween the non-evaluative description of options, the intermediate\ndescription, and the evaluative description as follows: \n\nOn this account, painting produces beauty, and beauty (which is not a\nvalue but the intermediate source of value) produces value. Similarly,\nreading a book produces knowledge, and gaining knowledge produces\nvalue. Now it should be clear how the monist can make sense of\nphenomena like higher and lower pleasures. The non-evaluative options\n(e.g. eating donuts) have diminishing marginal non-basic value. \n\nOn top of that, the intermediate effect, or non-basic value,\n(e.g. experiencing pleasure) can have a diminishing contribution to\nvalue. Varying diminishing marginal value in these cases is easily\nexplained psychologically. It is just the way we are—we get\nless and less enjoyment from donuts as we eat more and more (at least\nin one sitting). However, we may well get the same amount of enjoyment\nfrom the tenth Johnny Cash song that we did from the first. In order\nto deal with the higher and lower pleasures case the monist will have\nto argue that pleasures themselves can have diminishing marginal\nutility—the monist can argue that gustatory pleasure gets\nboring after a while, and hence contributes less and less to the super\nvalue—well being, or whatever it\n is.[9] \n\nThis picture brings us back to the distinction between foundational\nand non-foundational pluralism. Notice that the monist theories being\nimagined here are foundationally monist, because they claim that\nthere is fundamentally one value, such as pleasure, and they are\npluralist at the level of ordinary choice because they claim that there are intermediate\nvalues, such as knowledge and beauty, which are valuable because of\nthe amount of pleasure they produce (or realize, or \ncontain—the exact relationship will vary from theory to\ntheory).  \nThe main advantage of pluralism is that it seems true to our\nexperience of value. We experience values as plural, and pluralism\ntells is that values are indeed plural. The monist can respond, as we\nhave seen, that there are ways to explain the apparent plurality of\nvalues without positing fundamentally plural values. Another,\ncomplementary strategy that the monist can pursue is to argue that\nmonism has theoretical virtues that pluralism lacks. In general, it\nseems that theories should be as simple and coherent as possible, and\nthat other things being equal, we should prefer a more coherent theory\nto a less coherent one. Thus so long as monism can make sense of\nenough of our intuitive judgments about the nature of value, then it\nis to be preferred to pluralism because it does better on the\ntheoretical virtue of coherence.\n \nAnother way to put this point is in terms of explanation. The monist\ncan point out that the pluralist picture lacks explanatory depth. It\nseems that a list of values needs some further explanation: what makes\nthese things values? (See Bradley, 2009, p.16). The monist picture is\nsuperior, because the monist can provide an explanation for the value\nof the (non-foundational) plurality of values: these things are values\nbecause they contribute to well-being, or pleasure, or whatever the\nfoundational monist value is. (See also the discussion of this in the\nentry on\n  value theory). Patricia Marino argues against this strategy (2016). She argues\nthat ‘systematicity’ (the idea that it is better to have\nfewer principles) is not a good argument in favour of monism. Marino\npoints out that explanation in terms of fewer fundamental principles\nis not necessarily better explanation. If there are plural\nvalues, then the explanation that appeals to plural values is a better\none, in the sense that it is the true one: it doesn’t deny the\nplurality of values. (2016, p.124-125). Even if we could give a monist\nexplanation without having to trade off against our pluralist\nintuitions, Marino argues, we have no particular reason to think that\nexplanations appealing to fewer principles are superior.  \n\nThere is a different account of value that we ought to consider here:\nthe view that value consists in preference or desire satisfaction. On\nthis view, knowledge and pleasure and so on are valuable when they are\ndesired, and if they are not desired anymore they are not valuable\nanymore. There is no need to appeal to complicated accounts of\ndiminishing marginal utility: it is uncontroversial that we sometimes\ndesire something and sometimes don’t. Thus complexities in choices are\nexplained by complexities in our desires, and it is uncontroversial\nthat our desires are complex. \n\nImagine a one person preference satisfaction account of value that\nsays simply that what is valuable is what P desires.\nApparently this view is foundationally monist: there is only one thing\nthat confers value (being desired by P), yet at the\nnon-foundational level there are many values (whatever P\ndesires). Let us say that P desires hot baths, donuts and\nknowledge. The structure of P’s desires is such that\nthere is a complicated ranking of these things, which will vary from\ncircumstance to circumstance. The ranking is not explained by the\nvalue of the objects,rather, her desire explains the ranking and\ndetermines the value of the objects. So it might be that P\nsometimes desires a hot bath and a donut equally, and cannot choose\nbetween them; it might be that sometimes she would choose knowledge\nover a hot bath and a donut, but sometimes she would choose a hot bath\nover knowledge. On James Griffin’s slightly more complex view,\nwell-being consist in the fulfillment of informed desire, and Griffin\npoints out that his view can explain discontinuities in value without\nhaving to appeal to diminishing marginal utility: \n\nThis version of foundational monism/normative pluralism escapes some\nof the problems that attend the goods approach. First, this view can\naccount for deep complexities in choice. The plural goods that P is\nchoosing between do not seem merely instrumental. Donuts are not good\nbecause they contribute to another value, and P does not desire donuts\nfor any reason other than their donuty nature. On this view, if it is\nhard to choose between donuts and hot baths it is because of the\nintrinsic nature of the objects. The key here is that value is\nconferred by desire, not by contribution to another value. Second,\nthis view can accommodate incomparabilities: if P desires a hot bath\nbecause of its hot bathy nature, and a donut because of its donuty\nnature, she may not be able to choose between them.  However, it is not entirely clear that a view like Griffin’s is\ngenuinely monist at the foundational level: the question arises, what\nis constraining the desires that qualify as value conferring? If the\nanswer is ‘nothing’, then the view seems genuinely monist,\nbut is probably implausible. Unconstrained desire accounts of value\nseem implausible because our desires can be for all sorts of \nthings—we may desire things that are bad for us, or we may desire\nthings because of some mistake we have made. If the answer is that\nthere is something constraining the desires that count as value\nconferring, then of course the question is, ‘what?’ Is it\nthe values of the things desired? A desire satisfaction view that\nrestricts the qualifying desires must give an account of what\nrestricts them, and obviously, the account may commit the view to\nfoundational pluralism.    Griffin addresses this question at the very beginning of his book\non well being (Griffin, 1986,\n ch.2).[10]\n As he puts it, \n\nGriffin’s account of the relationship between desire and value is\nsubtle, and (partly because Griffin himself does not distinguish\nbetween foundational and normative pluralism) it is difficult to say\nwhether his view is foundationally pluralist or not. Griffin argues\nthat it is a mistake to see desire as a blind motivational \nforce—we desire things that we perceive in a favorable light- we\ntake them to have a desirability feature. When we try to explain what\ninvolved in seeing things in a favorable light, we cannot, according\nto Griffin, separate understanding from desire:  \n\nThis suggests that the view is indeed pluralist at the\nfoundation—values are not defined entirely by desire, but partly\nby other features of the situation, and so at the most fundamental\nlevel there is more than one value making feature. Griffin himself\nsays that “the desire account is compatible with a strong form of\npluralism about values” (p. 31). \n\nI shall not pursue further the question whether or not Griffin is a\nfoundational pluralist, my aim in this section is to show first, that\nmonist preference satisfaction accounts of value may have more\ncompelling ways of explaining complexities in value comparison than\nmonist goods approaches, but second, to point out that any constrained\ndesire account may well actually be foundationally pluralist. As soon\nas something is introduced to constrain the desires that qualify as\nvalue conferring, it looks as though another value is operating.\n \n\nThe big question facing pluralism is whether rational choices can be\nmade between irreducibly plural values. Irreducible plurality appears\nto imply incommensurability—that is to say, that there is no\ncommon measure which can be used to compare two different values. (See\nthe entry on\n incommensurable values.)\n Value incommensurability seems worrying: if values are incommensurable, then\neither we are forced into an ad hoc ranking, or we cannot rank the\nvalues at all.  Neither of these are very appealing options.  \nHowever, pluralists reject this dilemma. \nBernard Williams argues that it is a mistake to think that pluralism\nimplies that comparisons are impossible. He says: \nMaking a similar point, Ruth Chang points out that incommensurability\nis often conflated with incomparability. She provides clear\ndefinitions of each: incommensurability is the lack of a common unit\nof value by which precise comparisons can be made. Two items are\nincomparable, if there is no possible relation of comparison, such as\n‘better than’, or ‘as good as’ (1997,\nIntroduction). Chang points out that incommensurability is often\nthought to entail incomparability, but it does not.  \nDefenders of pluralism have used various strategies to show that it is\npossible to make rational choices between plural values.  \n\nThe pluralist’s most common strategy in the face of worries about\nchoices between incommensurable values is to appeal to practical\nwisdom—the faculty described by Aristotle—a faculty of\njudgment that the wise and virtuous person has, which enables him to\nsee the right answer. Practical wisdom is not just a question of being\nable to see and collate the facts, it goes beyond that in some\nway—the wise person will see things that only a wise person\ncould see. So plural values can be compared in that a wise person will\n‘just see’ that one course of action rather than another\nis to be taken. This strategy is used (explicitly or implicitly) by\nMcDowell (1979), Nagel (1979), Larmore (1987), Skorupski (1996),\nAnderson (1993 and 1997) Wiggins (1997 and 1998), Chappell (1998),\nSwanton (2003). Here it is in Nagel’s words: \n\nThe main issue for this solution to the comparison problem is to come\nup with an account of what practical wisdom is. It is not easy to\nunderstand what sort of thing the faculty of judgment might be, or how\nit might work. Obviously pluralists who appeal to this strategy do not\nwant to end up saying that the wise judge can see which of the options\nhas more goodness, as that would constitute collapsing back into\nmonism. So the pluralist has to maintain that the wise judge makes a\njudgment about what the right thing to do is without making any\nquantitative judgment. The danger is that the faculty seems entirely\nmysterious: it is a kind of magical vision, unrelated to our\nnatural senses. As a solution to the comparison problem, the appeal to\npractical wisdom looks rather like way of shifting the problem to\nanother level. Thus the appeal to practical wisdom cannot be left at\nthat. The pluralist owes more explanation of what is involved\nin practical wisdom. What follows below are various pluralists’\naccounts of how choice between plural values is possible, and whether\nsuch choice is rational. \nOne direction that pluralists have taken is to argue that although\nvalues are plural, there is nonetheless an available scale on which to\nrank them. This scale is not rationalized by something that the values\nhave in common (that would be monism), but by something over and above\nthe values, which is not itself a super value. Williams sometimes\nwrites as if this is his intention, as do Griffin (1986 and 1997),\nStocker (1990), Chang (1997 and 2004), Taylor (1982 and 1997). James\nGriffin (1986) develops this suggestion in his discussion of plural\nprudential values. According to Griffin, we do not need to have a\nsuper-value to have super-scale. Griffin says: \n \nThis passage is slightly hard to interpret (for more on why see my\nearlier discussion of Griffin in the section on preference\nsatisfaction accounts). On one interpretation, Griffin is in fact\nespousing a sophisticated monism. The basic value is ‘worth to\none’s life’, and though it is important to talk about non-basic\nvalues, such as the different dimensions of pleasure and happiness,\nthey are ultimately judged in terms of their contribution to the worth\nof lives. \n\nThe second possible interpretation takes Griffin’s claim that worth to\nlife is not a supervalue seriously. On this interpretation, it is\nhard to see what worth to life is, if not a supervalue. Perhaps it is\nonly a value that we should resort to when faced with\nincomparabilities. However, this interpretation invites the criticism\nthat Griffin is introducing a non-moral value, perhaps prudential\nvalue, to arbitrate when moral values are incommensurable.  In other\nwords, we cannot decide between incommensurable values on moral\ngrounds, so we should decide on prudential grounds. This seems\nreasonable when applied to incommensurabilities in aesthetic\nvalues. One might not be able to say whether Guernica is better than\nWar and Peace, but one might choose to have Guernica displayed on the\nwall because it will impress one’s friends, or because it is worth\nmore money, or even because one just enjoys it more. In the case of\nmoral choices this is a less convincing strategy: it introduces a\nlevel of frivolity into morality that seems out of place. \n\nStocker’s main strategy is to argue that values are plural, and\ncomparisons are made, so it must be possible to make rational\ncomparisons. He suggests that a “higher level synthesizing category”\ncan explain how comparisons are made (1990, p. 172). According to\nStocker these comparisons are not quantitative, they are evaluative:\n  Stocker claims that goodness is just the highest level\nsynthesizing category, and that lower goods are constitutive means to\nthe good. Ruth Chang’s approach to comparisons of plural values is\nvery similar (Chang 1997 (introduction) and 2004). Chang claims that\ncomparisons can only be made in terms of a covering value—a\nmore comprehensive value that has the plural values as parts. \n\nThere is a problem in understanding quite what a ‘synthesizing\ncategory’ or ‘covering value’ is. How does the\ncovering value determine the relative weightings of the constituent\nvalues? One possibility is that it does it by pure \nstipulation—as a martini just is a certain proportion of gin and\nvermouth. However, stipulation does not have the right sort of\nexplanatory power. On the other hand, if a view is to remain\npluralist, it must avoid conflating the super scale with a super\nvalue. Chang argues that her covering values are sufficiently unitary\nto provide a basis for comparison, and yet preserve the separateness\nof the other values. Chang’s argument goes as follows: the values at\nstake in a situation (for example, prudence and morality) cannot on\ntheir own determine how heavily they weigh in a particular choice\nsituation—the values weigh differently depending on the\ncircumstances of the choice. However, the values plus the\ncircumstances cannot determine relevant weightings \neither—because (I am simplifying here) the internal circumstances of the\nchoice will affect the weighting of the values differently depending\non the external circumstances. To use Chang’s own example, when the\nvalues at stake are prudence and morality (specifically, the duty to\nhelp an innocent victim), and the circumstances include the fact that\nthe victim is far away, the effect this circumstance will have on the\nweighting of the values depends on external circumstances, which fix\nwhat matters in the choice. So, as Chang puts it, “‘What\nmatters’ must therefore have content beyond the values and the\ncircumstances of the choice” (2004, p. 134). \n\nStocker is aware of the worry that appeal to something in terms of\nwhich comparisons can be made reduces the view to monism: Stocker\ninsists that the synthesizing category (such as a good life) is not a\nunitary value—it is at most ‘nominal monism’ in my\nterminology. Stocker argues that it is a philosophical prejudice to\nthink that rational judgment must be quantitative, and so he claims\nthat he does not need to give an account of how we form and use the\nhigher level synthesizing categories. \n\nAnother approach to the comparison problem appeals to basic\npreferences. Joseph Raz takes the line that we can explain choice\nbetween irreducibly plural goods by talking about basic preferences.\nRaz approaches the issue of incommensurability by talking about the\nnature of agency and rationality instead of about the nature of value.\nHe distinguishes between two conceptions of human agency: the\nrationalist conception, and the classical conception. The rationalist\nconception corresponds to what we have called the stronger use of the\nterm rational. According to the rationalist conception, reasons\nrequire action. The classical conception, by contrast, “regards\nreasons as rendering options eligible” (Raz 1999, p. 47). Raz favors\nthe classical conception, which regards the will as something separate\nfrom desire:  \n\nRaz’s view about the nature of agency is defended in great detail over\nthe course of many  articles, and all of those arguments cannot\nbe examined in detail here. What is crucial in the context of this\ndiscussion of pluralism is whether Raz gives us a satisfactory account\nof the weaker sense of rational. Raz’s solution to the problem of\nincommensurability hangs on the claim that it can be rational (in the\nweak sense) to choose A over B  when there are no further reasons\nfavouring A over B. We shall restrict ourselves to mentioning one\nobjection to the view in the context of moral choices between plural\ngoods. Though Raz’s account of choice may seem plausible in cases\nwhere we choose between non-moral values, it seems to do violence to\nthe concept of morality. Consider one of Raz’s own examples, the\nchoice between a banana and a pear. It may be that one has to choose\nbetween them, and there is no objective reason to choose one or the\nother. In this case, it seems Raz’s account of choice is plausible. If\none feels like eating a banana, then in this case, desire does provide\na reason. As Raz puts it, “A want can never tip the balance of\nreasons in and of itself. Rather, our wants become relevant when\nreasons have run their course.” In the example where we choose\nbetween a banana and a pear, this sounds fine. However, if we apply it\nto a moral choice it seems a lot less plausible. Raz admits that\n“If of the options available to agents in typical situations of\nchoice and decision, several are incommensurate, then reason can\nneither determine nor completely explain their choices or\nactions” (Raz, 1999, p. 48). Thus many moral choices are not\ndirected by reason but by a basic preference. It is not fair to call\nit a desire, because on Raz’s account we desire things for\nreasons—we take the object of our desire to be desirable. On\nRaz’s picture then, when reasons have run their course, we are\nchoosing without reasons. It doesn’t matter hugely whether we call\nthat ‘rational’ (it is not rational in the strong sense,\nbut it is in the weak sense). What matters is whether this weak\nsense of rational is sufficient to satisfy our concept of moral choice\nas being objectively defensible. The problem is that choosing without\nreasons look rather like plumping. Plumping may be an intelligible\nform of choice, but it is questionable whether it is a satisfactory\naccount of moral choice. \n\nOne philosopher who is happy to accept that there may be situations\nwhere we just cannot make reasoned choices between plural values is\nIsaiah Berlin, who claimed that goods such as liberty and equality\nconflict at the fundamental level. Berlin is primarily concerned with\npolitical pluralism, and with defending political liberalism, but his\nviews about incomparability have been very influential in\ndiscussions on moral pluralism. Bernard Williams (1981), Charles\nLarmore (1987), John Kekes (1993), Michael Stocker (1990 and 1997),\nDavid Wiggins (1997) have all argued that there are at least some\ngenuinely irresolvable conflicts between values, and that to expect a\nrational resolution is a mistake. For Williams this is part of a more\ngeneral mistake made by contemporary moral philosophers—he\nthinks that philosophy tries to make ethics too easy, too much like\narithmetic. Williams insists throughout his writings that ethics is a\nmuch more complex and multi-faceted beast than its treatment at the\nhands of moral philosophers would suggest, and so it is not surprising\nto him that there should be situations where values conflict\nirresolvably. Stocker (1990) discusses the nature of moral conflict at\ngreat length, and although he thinks that many apparent conflicts can\nbe dissolved or are not serious, like Williams, he argues that much of\ncontemporary philosophy’s demand for simplicity is mistaken. Stocker\nargues that ethics need not always be action guiding, that value is\nmuch more complex than Kantians and utilitarians would have us think,\nand that as the world is complicated we will inevitably face\nconflicts.  Several pluralists have argued that accepting the\ninevitability of value conflicts does not result in a  breakdown\nof moral argument, but rather the reverse. Kekes (1993), for example,\nclaims that pluralism enables us to see that irresolvable\ndisagreements are not due to wickedness on the part of our\ninterlocutor, but may be due to the plural nature of values. \n\nThe battle lines in the debate between pluralism and monism are not\nalways clear. In this entry I have outlined some of them, and\ndiscussed some of the main arguments. Pluralists need to be clear\nabout whether they are foundational or non-foundational pluralists. Monists must defend\ntheir claim that there really is a unitary value. Much of the debate\nbetween pluralists and monists has focussed on the issue of whether\nthe complexity of moral choice implies that values really are \nplural—a pattern emerges in which the monist claims to be able to\nexplain the appearance of plurality away, and the pluralist insists\nthat the appearance reflects a pluralist reality. Finally, pluralists\nmust explain how comparisons between values are made, or defend the\nconsequence that incommensurability is widespread.
