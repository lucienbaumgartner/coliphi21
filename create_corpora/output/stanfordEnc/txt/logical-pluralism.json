Logics are theories of validity: they tell us, for different\narguments, whether or not that argument is of a valid form. Different\nlogics disagree about which argument forms are\n valid.[1]\n For example, logics like Classical and Strong Kleene logic tell us\nthat that ex falso quodlibet, the argument form below, is valid:\n\n\n\n A¬\nAB\n\n\nHowever Relevant logics and other Paraconsistent logics say that this\nargument form is not valid. It’s natural to think that they\ncan’t all be right. If ex falso quodlibet is valid, then the\nRelevant and Paraconsistent logics are not correct theories of\nvalidity, or as we might say, they are not correct\nlogics. Alternatively, if ex falso quodlibet is not valid,\nthen Classical logic and Strong Kleene logic are not correct. Logical\npluralism takes many forms, but the most philosophically interesting\nand controversial forms of the view hold that more than one logic can\nbe correct, that is: logics L1 and L2 can\ndisagree about which arguments are valid, and both can be getting\nthings right.\n\n\nMuch current work on the subject was sparked by a series of papers by\nJC Beall and Greg Restall (Beall & Restall 2000, 2001; Restall\n2002), which culminated in the book (Beall & Restall 2006). This\nwork has generated a substantial literature, including papers arguing\nagainst pluralism and for logical monism, the view that there can only\nbe One True\n Logic.[2.]\n Interest in the contemporary debate has also led to a re-examination\nof some older views, especially the pluralism resulting from Carnap’s\nfamous tolerance for different linguistic frameworks and the work of\nScottish/French logician Hugh McColl (1837–1909), who some have\nclaimed was an early logical pluralist (Rahman & Redmond 2008). \nThe recent upsurge of interest has also resulted in the proposal of\nseveral additional varieties of logical pluralism, some of which are\nsurveyed in the final section below. \n\nHow could two logics both be correct, when they disagree about which\narguments are valid? One way is if there is more than one relation of\nlogical consequence (and so more than one interpretation of\n‘valid’) so that one of the logics captures validity in\none sense, while its rival captures validity in another. Pluralists\ncommonly elaborate on this by maintaining that natural language\nexpressions like ‘follows from’ are unsettled, vague, or\nambiguous, and may be settled, made more precise, or disambiguated, in\nmore than one way (Shapiro 2014, 1–2). The best-known version of this\nview, for example, is presented as the conjunction of two main theses\n(Beall & Restall 2006). First, the Generalised Tarski Thesis:  \nGeneralised Tarski Thesis (GTT):\n\nAn argument is validx if and only if in every\ncasex in which the premises are true, so is the\nconclusion. \nSecond, the thesis that the expression\n‘casex’ in the (GTT) can be made more\nprecise in at least two, equally acceptable, ways, resulting in\ndifferent extensions for ‘valid’. For example, by\n‘case’ we might mean a first-order interpretation of the\nkind Tarski uses to define classical first-order consequence (Tarski\n1983) or alternatively we might mean a possible situation. Other\nalternatives include inconsistent or incomplete interpretations, of\nthe sort used in the model theories for intuitionistic and\nparaconsistent logics. Different choices for the interpretation of\n‘case’ will result in a different precisifications of the\n(GTT) analysis of logical consequence, which may in turn result in\ndifferent relations of logical consequence (Beall & Restall 2006,\n29–31). Call this view ‘Case-based Logical Pluralism.’ \nCase-based pluralists do not need to hold that every conceivable\nprecisification of the GTT defines a relation of logical consequence.\nTypically, they think that only relations with certain\nproperties—e.g., necessity, normativity and formality—are\nadmissible (Beall & Restall 2006, 26–35). Hence having its\nextension given by a precisification of the GTT is only a necessary\ncondition on being a genuine relation of logical consequence. \nOne argument for case-based pluralism is the argument from appearances\n(Beall & Restall 2006, 30–31). According to it, pluralism is\njust straightforwardly plausible—it appears to be true—and\nhence ought to be believed in the absence of reasons not to believe\nit. \nThis might seem like a surprising approach, given the presumption of\nlogical monism in the writings of most logicians of the\npast—presumably pluralism did not appear to be correct to them.\nBut perhaps once one considers the GTT explicitly, accepts the\nunderdetermination of ‘case’ and considers a few of the\nways it can be made more precise to get different logics, it just\nseems clear that there will be several alternative ways to make it\nmore specific, with none singled out as more correct than the others\nby current usage. The hardest thing about logical pluralism, one might\nthink, was seeing how it could be a coherent view at all, but once the\nwork of developing and laying out the case-based view has been done,\nthe resulting position can strike one as quite reasonable. Perhaps an\nunbiased reader should feel tempted to endorse it?  \nOne problem with this argument is that the plausibility of a view\ntends to vary with the onlooker’s ability to think up reasonable\nalternatives; if view A seems like the only reasonable way a certain\nthing can have happened, then we might shrug and accept it as our best\nworking hypothesis. But if we can conceive of several\ndifferent ways things could plausibly be, we might rationally\nwithhold judgement pending more evidence.  \nMore specifically, while the case-based pluralism is not patently\nimplausible, it does rest on a linguistic picture with two distinctive\nfeatures: first, that the meaning of ‘case’ is unsettled,\nand second, that given that it is unsettled, the discovery of more\nthan one reasonable precisification should make us pluralists. But\nneither of these features is inevitable. Contemporary philosophy of\nlanguage describes models in which the correctness of the application\nof some ordinary language expression—such as\n‘water’, ‘elm’ or ‘star’—can\nturn on the presence or absence of a feature that ordinary speakers\nneed not be able to distinguish, such as having a certain constitution\nor make-up. Why should ‘follows from’ not be similar? That\nis, though no a priori analysis of ‘follows from’\n(or ‘valid’) uncovers the single correct precisification\nof the (GTT), there might nevertheless exist an account—perhaps\nmaking use of sophisticated mathematical techniques—that exactly\ncaptures the extension of ‘follows from’. Rival accounts\nwould then have the same status as rival accounts of stars or water.\nThough analysis of the word ‘star’ will not tell us that\nstars are not holes in the fabric of the night, or the gods riding\ntheir chariots across the heavens, those accounts are still wrong.\nSimilarly, though analysis of the expression ‘follows\nfrom’ might not tell us that intuitionist accounts are wrong,\nthey might be wrong nonetheless. In such circumstances we might hold\nthat the meaning of ‘follows from’ is not really\nunderspecified.  \nSecondly, even if the meaning of the expression is\nunderspecified, it needn’t be the case that any\nprecisifications are correct, and hence pluralism is not an inevitable\nconsequence of the underspecificity. Consider a paradigm\nunderspecified word like ‘heap’ and a thinker who presents\nthemselves as a pluralist about the heap property. They hold that one\nmay specify the meaning of ‘heap’ different ways within\ncertain parameters, and arrive at conflicting but equally correct\ndefinitions of ‘heap.’ For example, the classical heapists\nmight claim that a heap is any pile of items with more than 10\nmembers, deviant heapists protest that a heap is any pile of items\nwith more than 13 members and the heap pluralist holds that both are\ncorrect. But there are lots of alternatives to pluralism here. For\nexample, one might think that anyone who interprets the English word\n‘heap’ as requiring a pile of n items for any\nspecific n is wrong, since they are trying to import more\nspecificity into the meaning of the word than can really be found\nthere. Or one might be a skeptic about heaps, on the grounds that the\nword is too vague—it fails to specify a genuine meaning—or\none might hold that the expression is context-sensitive: in some\ncontexts it picks out the classical property, in some the deviant, but\nargue that that doesn’t make one a pluralist about heaps, anymore than\nacknowledging that ‘I’ picks out different people in\ndifferent contexts makes one a pluralist about oneself.  \nThe mere possibility of these alternatives does not, by itself, argue\nagainst that view, but it does undermine the argument from\nappearances, since the availability of these alternatives makes it\nclear that the intriguing reasonableness of pluralism is not unique.\n \nA different argument for logical pluralism invokes the view’s combined\npractical and theoretical virtues:  \nOne virtue is that the plurality of the consequence relation comes at\nlittle or no cost. Another is that pluralism offers a more charitable\ninterpretation of many important (but difficult) debates in\nphilosophical logic than is otherwise available; we will argue that\npluralism does more justice to the mix of insight and perplexity found\nin many of the debates in logic in the last century. (Beall &\nRestall 2006, 31) \nPluralists have also stressed that their view encourages innovation in\nlogic (Carnap 1937, foreward), and allows one to study more\nmathematical theories, such as those that would be rendered trivial by\nclassical logic (Shapiro 2014, Ch. 3). \nSuch claims can be quite difficult to assess. Some important\ndistinctions need to be drawn between theoretical and practical\nreasons to endorse pluralism, and even once this has been done it can\nbe difficult to decide whether the view, over all, really possesses a\nvirtue—it may depend on substantial empirical claims for which\nthe evidence has yet to be gathered—whether or not it possesses\na greater weight of virtues than rival theories (is not logical monism\na simpler theory, and simplicity a theoretical virtue too?) and\nfinally whether or not that is a good reason to believe the view.  \nFor example, one virtue claimed for logical pluralism is charity, but\nnot all instances of charity are theoretically virtuous; no-one should\nthink that deterministic physics is more likely to be correct because\nit allows a more charitable view of wrong-doers, or of Einstein.\nCharity can be misplaced. But one place where charity is taken\nseriously as a theoretical virtue is in the assessment of theories of\nmeaning and translation—though even here it can be misplaced,\nsince it is not a virtue if a theory interprets infants as uttering\ntrue claims about quantum mechanics (Davidson 1984). Logical pluralism\nis not itself a thesis about translation or interpretation, but one\nabout logics and how many there are. Nonetheless, the version outlined\nabove rests on some substantial claims about the meaning of\n‘valid’ and ‘follows from’ and it might be\nargued that it is proper to invoke charity in adjudicating between\nthis theory and rival ones for that reason: we are deciding between\ntheories which interpret ‘valid’ and ‘follows\nfrom’ differently. Perhaps one of these interpretations seems to\nmake our informants (both ordinary language users and the experts who\nhave written about logic) responsible for fewer false claims.  \nBut an opponent might respond that interpreting ordinary speakers as\nuttering truths concerning logic can look rather similar to\nattributing true beliefs about quantum mechanics to infants. As the\nWason selection task experiments have shown in psychology, even\neducated speakers will fail to act as if the argument form modus\ntollens is correct in certain circumstances (Wason 1966, 1968;\nCosmides 1989). Though the most charitable interpretation of their\nbehaviour might be that they do not mean by ‘follows from’\nwhat the experimenters meant by it, by far the most natural\nunderstanding of what is going on here is that the subjects make\nmistakes. To interpret them as meaning something different by misses\nwhat these experiments reveal about human reasoning, and fails to\nexplain why the subjects later judge that their earlier answers were\nwrong.  \nThe logical pluralist can agree with this, but distinguish between\nbeing charitable to ordinary speakers, and being charitable to expert\nlogicians. It is, they might maintain, expert logicians that we should\ninterpret charitably, including those experts who have proposed\napparently incompatible systems. Relevant logicians have written\n‘disjunctive syllogism is not valid’. Classical logicians\nhave written ‘disjunctive syllogism is valid’.\nIntuitionist logicians say ‘double negation elimination is not\nvalid’. Classical logicians have retorted ‘double negation\nelimination is so valid.’ If logical monism is correct, at least\ntwo or more of these parties have written falsehoods. Logical\npluralism would allow us to say that more than one, perhaps many more\nthan one, have been writing truths.  \nBut logical pluralism is also uncharitable in ways that\nlogical monism is not, since it holds that the monist participants in\ndebates over which logic is correct have been arguing based on a\nconfusion. The upshot with respect to the argument from charity, and\nfrom virtue more generally, is that quite a lot remains to be done\nbefore it will be clear which virtues are desirable and the extent to\nwhich logical pluralism possesses them to a greater degree than its\nrivals.  \nOne objection to case-based logical pluralism is to allow that\n‘case’ is underspecified and admits of various\ninterpretations, but reject the further step that those\ninterpretations correspond to different relations of logical\nconsequence. We can do this is by insisting on the largest possible\ndomain for the quantifier ‘every’ in the context of the\nGTT. There is a tradition in logic that holds that in order for an\nargument to be logically valid, the conclusion must be true\nin (unrestrictedly) all cases in which the premises are true.\nSo when ‘every’ is used in defining logical consequence,\nwe might argue, it must be understood in the broadest possible way: if\nthere are any cases at all—anywhere, of any kind—in which\nthe premises are true and the conclusion is false, the argument will\nbe invalid, and if not, then the argument will be valid. The One True\nLogic, then, will be the one that describes the relation of\ntruth-preservation over all cases—where\n‘all’ is construed as broadly as possible (Beall &\nRestall 2006, 92; Priest 2006, 202).  \nSuppose we do take the broadest interpretation of ‘every’.\nOne question is whether we will be left with any useful relation of\nlogical consequence at all. Logics which are arrived at by quantifying\nover extra cases have a tendency to be weaker—that is, to\nclassify fewer arguments as valid—since the more cases we\ninclude, the better our chances of including one in which the premises\nof a particular argument are true and the conclusion false.\nDialetheists would include cases in which both a sentence and its\nnegation are true, and this means we can have cases where P and\n¬P are true, but Q is false, making both P\n∨ Q and ¬P true, even though Q is not, and\nthus providing a counterexample to the argument form disjunctive\nsyllogism. If this is acceptable, one might think, why not\nallow cases where A ∧ B is true, but B is\nnot? Or worse. Perhaps if we construe ‘every case’ broadly\nenough, we will find that there are no valid arguments left, and hence\nthe result will not be logical monism, but a form of logical nihilism,\nor something close to it:  \n…we see no place to stop the process of generalisation\nand broadening of accounts of cases. For all we know, the only\ninference left in the intersection of (unrestricted) all\nlogics might be the identity inference: From A to\ninfer A. That identity is the only really valid\nargument is implausible and, we think, an unmotivated conclusion.\n(Beall & Restall 2006,\n 92)[3] \nPriest disagrees, and suggests that what will stop the slide down this\nslippery slope is the fact that certain key consequence relations hold\nin virtue of the meanings of the connectives:  \nI think it just false that all principles of inference fail in some\nsituation. For example, any situation in which a conjunction holds,\nthe conjuncts hold, simply in virtue of the meaning of ∧. (Priest\n2006, 202–203) \nBut it is relatively common for logicians to claim that the logical\nprinciples that they endorse are valid in virtue of the\nmeanings of the connectives involved. The intuitionist logician denies\nthat A ∨¬A is true in virtue of the meanings of ∨ and ¬\nthough other logicians will say that it is, and it is difficult to\nadjudicate such disputes independently of a more substantial theory of\nthe meanings of the connectives. This is yet another area where the\ndispute over logical pluralism runs into an older dispute in the\nphilosophy of logic, and one that is ostensibly a question about\nmeaning. The two key questions that remain for the success of this\nmonist objection are i) which, if any, argument forms are guaranteed\nto preserve truth (perhaps in virtue of meaning) in any case\nwhatsoever, and ii) if there are any such argument forms, are there\nenough of them to constitute a non-trival logic?  \nThere is more than one plausible model for the underspecificity of\n‘case’ in the GTT. The version of pluralism we have been\nconsidering allows different kinds of things to count as\n‘cases.’ Sometimes a case may be a mathematical structure,\nsometimes a possible world (perhaps incomplete or inconsistent) or the\nactual world or parts of\n it.[4]\n Given this, the underspecification of ‘case’ in the GTT\ncould be less like the indeterminacy that results from variation in\nthe domain of quantification, and more like the variation that results\nfrom polysemy. Consider:  \nThis sentence has two readings because the word\n‘bank’—even once we’re talking about money—has\nmore than one meaning. It can mean a financial institution (such as\nHSBC), or the building where a such an institution offers its services\n(such as the bank five minutes from campus.) Sometimes additional\ncontext can rule out one of the readings, for example:  \nin which it is clear that bank-as-financial-institution is meant, and\n \nin which it is clear that bank-as-building is meant.  \nWhen we were assuming that the underspecificity in the GTT resulted\nfrom underspecificity about the domain of quantification for\n‘every’ there was a natural temptation to think that we\nwould get the strictest, most careful and correct answer by dealing\nwith a completely unrestricted domain. In the polysemy kind of case\nhowever, what can vary is not (just) the size of the domain of\nquantification but also which kind of object it is that we are making\nclaims about. The result is that we can allow the domain of\nquantification to be as large as we like, and no object of the wrong\nkind can count as a counterexample to the general claim, precisely\nbecause it is of the wrong kind. To illustrate with\n‘bank’: if we mean bank-as-financial-institution, then no\nbank-as-building can serve as a counterexample to (1), no matter how\nunrestricted the domain of quantification—since the sentence is\nnot making a claim about such things. And conversely, if we mean\nbank-as-building, then no internet bank-as-financial institution can\nbe a counterexample to sentence (3).  \nSo suppose that ‘case’ in the GTT is polysemous. Perhaps\n‘case’ sometimes means possible world, but it can also be\nused to mean first-order model. If the classical logician means\nfirst-order model by ‘case’, then it is not legitimate to\ncomplain that he has failed to take into account incomplete possible\nworlds, and hence has not considered every case. On the\ncase-as-FO-model disambiguation of ‘case’, the classical\nlogician has considered every case, since incomplete possible\nworlds are not cases in that sense.  \nLet’s continue to assume that ‘case’ is polysemous. Just\nas there was room for someone to argue that only a single\ninterpretation of ‘every’ was appropriate in the GTT, so a\nmonist might argue here that there is only one appropriate\ndisambiguation of ‘case’ in the GTT, and hence that there\nis only one relation of logical consequence.  \nWe can develop that thought as follows. The logician’s task is to\ncapture the consequence relation on natural language sentences, but it\nusually simplifies things to pay attention only to particular\nexpressions in those sentences, such as conjunction, negation, and\ndisjunction, say, or those expressions plus the universal quantifier\nand identity. Whichever set of symbols we select as our so-called\nlogical constants, the meanings of all the other expressions\nin the sentences—the non-logical expressions—are\ndetermined by the interpretations (or, as we call them in the GTT,\n‘cases’), and since we are quantifying over all such\ninterpretations, in effect we are simply ignoring the meanings of all\nnon-logical expressions.  \nSo now consider what we might say about this argument:  \nNormally we’d translate this into the language of first-order\npredicate logic as something like this:  \nThat formal argument is not valid, but one might still want to say\nthat the original, natural language argument is. First-order\nlogic which fails to treat words like ‘red’ and\n‘colored’ as logical constants, one might think, falls\nshort of capturing logical consequence.  \nPriest considers this view, and though he acknowledges that it is not\nthe only view one might have, he holds that it’s the right one.  \nThe standard move [to resist this line of thought] is to claim that\nthe inference is, in fact, invalid, but that it appears to be\nvalid because we confuse it with a valid enthymeme with suppressed\npremise ‘All red things are colored’ taken for granted.\n(Priest 2006, 201) \nBut suppose we do hold, as Priest does, that the argument is valid.\nGeneralising, we might think that if you are interested only in the\ntruth about logical consequence, then it is never legitimate\nto ignore the meaning of some expression in an argument. If simplicity\nand conservativeness are of no concern, then you should not be\nappealing to Tarski-style interpretations in defining\nvalidity—since the whole point of such interpretations is to\nallow the meanings of certain expressions to vary. Better than any\n‘interpretation’ would be a complete possible world\n(perhaps we can argue about which things are included in ‘all\npossible worlds’, but there might also be a correct answer to\nthat question.) Hence many of the possible disambiguations of\n‘case’ give us different false theories of\nvalidity. Those might be useful because they are simple and they\napproximate the true account, but since the logics they capture are\nnot correct, this is a view on which no pluralism threatens.  \nA different objection to logical pluralism starts from the premise\nthat logic is normative, where this means that logics have\nconsequences for how we ought to reason, i.e. for what we ought to\nbelieve, and for how we ought to update our beliefs when we learn new\nthings. Many writers have thought that logic is normative, sometimes\nbecause they have thought that logic just is the science of\ngood reasoning: \nIn Logic we do not want to know how the understanding is and thinks,\nand how it has hitherto proceeded in thinking, but how it ought to\nproceed in thinking. (Kant 1800, p. 4) \nlogic is a normative subject: it is supposed to provide an account of\ncorrect reasoning. (Priest 1979, p. 297) \nSometimes, though, philosophers have taken the position that whether\nor not logic is about reasoning, its claims about logical consequence\nhave normative consequences for reasoning: \nRules for asserting, thinking, judging, inferring, follow from the\nlaws of truth. And thus one can very well speak of laws of thought\ntoo. (Frege 1918,\n pp. 289–90)[5] \n…logical consequence is normative. In an important sense, if\nanargument is valid, then you somehow go wrong if you accept\nthepremises but reject the conclusion. (Beall & Restall 2006,\np. 16) \nThere is an apparent tension between this alleged\nnormativity of logic and the thesis of logical pluralism. Suppose, for\nexample that if an argument form is valid, then some normative\nconclusion follows concerning what we ought to believe. (Perhaps it is\nthat we ought to believe the conclusion of an instance of the argument\nform if we believe the premises, though much work on the normativity\nof logic suggests that it would need to be something substantially\nmore complicated.) Now suppose that logical pluralism is correct. In\nparticular logic 1, which says that disjunctive syllogism is valid,\nand logic 2, which says that disjunctive syllogism is not valid, are\nboth correct. Ought we to believe what logic 1 tells us to believe? It\nis hard to see how we could escape this obligation, given that logic 1\ntells us that the premises entail the conclusion, and logic 1 is\ncorrect. Yet if the normative consequence for belief does follow, then\nperhaps logic 2 is falling down in some respect—it fails to capture\nall of the obligations that follow from our logic. As S. Read puts it: \nVersions of this objection can be found in Priest 2006, Read 2006,\nKeefe 2014 (p. 1385), and Steinberger 2018, and there are responses in\nCaret 2016, Russell 2017 and Blake-Turner & Russell forthcoming. \nA final question for pluralists is whether they are correct to take\nrival logicians to be arguing about the same logical\nprinciples. The classical logician accepts a logical truth which they\nwrite “A ∨¬A” and the Strong Kleene rejects as a logical\ntruth a principle which they write the same way. But it only follows\nthat they accept different logics if the symbols express the same\nprinciple in both cases, and in particular, if “∨” and\n“¬” mean the same in both. \nIn debate, monists have often been willing to grant this assumption to\nthe pluralists, because they have assumed that their preferred logic\nis right and the rival logic wrong, not that they and their\nrivals were talking past each other. Still, the suggestion was\nfamously made by Quine (1986, 81) that in a dispute between rival\nlogicians “neither party knows what he is talking about” since\nthey cease to be talking about negation as soon as its core\nlogical properties are seriously questioned (in Quine’s example the\nlogicians argue about whether sentences of the form A∧¬A can\nbe true.)  \nThe pluralist thus needs a way to exclude the possibility that each of\ntheir preferred logics is correct, but that pluralism itself is still\nfalse, because those logics don’t disagree. Perhaps each logic\ncould even be a part of a single, greater logic containing\ne.g. intuitionist negation and paraconsistent negation as well as\nclassical negation and Strong Kleene negation etc. Places were\npluralists have taken on this question include Beall and Restall 2001\n(§3) and Hjortland 2013. \nThe contemporary debate over case-based logical pluralism has lead to\na revival of interest in an older form of pluralism advocated by the\nfamous logical positivist, Rudolf Carnap (1937, §17 and 1958;\nsee also Restall 2002; Cook 2010; Field 2009; Kouri Kissel\nforthcoming; Varzi 2002; Eklund 2012).  \nIn section 17 of The Logical Syntax of Language, Carnap\nwrites:  \nIn logic there are no morals. Everyone is at liberty to build his own\nlogic, i.e. his own language, as he wishes. All that is required of\nhim is that, if he wishes to discuss it, he must state his methods\nclearly, and give syntactical rules instead of philosophical\narguments. (Carnap 1937, §17) \nTwo kinds of tolerance are expressed in this passage. The more famous\nis Carnap’s tolerance for different languages, and it is motivated\nboth by the thought that verbal disputes are not really theoretical\ndisputes about the domain we are describing, but at best practical\nones about the most useful and efficient ways to use words, given our\ngoals, and by the thought that such practical matters are best left to\nthose working in the relevant field. As Carnap wrote later,  \nLet us grant to those who work in any special fields of investigation\nthe freedom to use any form of expression which seems useful to them.\nThe work in the field will sooner or later lead to the elimination of\nthose forms which have no useful function. Let us be cautious in\nmaking assertions and critical in examining them, but tolerant in\npermitting linguistic forms. (Carnap 1958, 221) \nThe second kind of tolerance is a tolerance for different\nlogics, something that is naturally construed as a kind of\nlogical pluralism. The phrase “everyone is at liberty to build\nhis own logic” suggests that no-one would be making a mistake in\nso doing, and it seems clear from the phrase “i.e. his own\nlanguage” that follows immediately after that Carnap takes the\ntwo kinds of toleration to be extremely close, perhaps even that he\nthinks linguistic tolerance and logical tolerance amount to the same\nthing.  \nIt might not be obvious to a modern reader why that is the case. Why\ncould we not be tolerant of alternative languages, which seems only\nsensible, without thereby committing ourselves to being tolerant of\nalternative logics? Moreover, logicians who disagree about which\nsentential logic is correct (e.g., classical or intuitionist) seem to\nbe able to use the same language (containing ∧, →, ¬,\netc.) even while they suppose that one logic is right for that\nlanguage, and one logic wrong. If that position is coherent, then one\nside must have made a mistake after all, implying they were not really\n‘at liberty to build their own logic.’  \nThat view seems at least an open possibility, though whether two rival\nlogicians are really advocating different logics for the same language\ncan be difficult to determine. It will not be sufficient that they are\nusing the same symbols, since they might each be using the symbols\nwith different meanings in which case they will be using different\nlanguages. But what more, beyond using the same expressions, is\nrequired?  \nThis is a question to which there are many rival answers, even for the\nmost basic logical constants. Perhaps the expressions must denote the\nsame truth-function, or have the same intension, or share a mode of\npresentation, or a character, or a conceptual role. But The\nLogical Syntax of Language was published (in German) in 1934,\nbefore the innovations of Grice, Gentzen, Montague, Kaplan, Lewis,\nPutnam or Kripke, (and, moreover before Tarski’s “On the Concept\nof Logical Consequence” (Schurz, 1998; Tarski 1983)) and in an\nenvironment in which Wittgenstein’s Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus was a powerful influence. Carnap has quite\ndefinite and explicit ideas about both meaning and logic, and these\nhelp to explain why he thinks linguistic tolerance leads straight to\nlogical tolerance. In the foreword he writes:  \nUp to now, in constructing a language, the procedure has usually been,\nfirst to assign a meaning to the fundamental mathematico-logical\nsymbols, and then to consider what sentences and inferences are seen\nto be logically correct in accordance with this meaning. Since the\nassignment of the meaning is expressed in words, and is, in\nconsequence, inexact, no conclusion arrived at in this way can very\nwell be otherwise than inexact and ambiguous. The connection will only\nbecome clear when approached from the opposite direction: let any\npostulates and any rules of inference be chosen arbitrarily; then this\nchoice, whatever it may be, will determine what meaning is to be\nassigned to the fundamental logical symbols. (Carnap 1937, xv). \nAccording to Carnap then, the right way to specify a language is to\npick some expressions, and then give the rules of inference for them.\nIt is this specification which gives the expressions their meanings,\nand so, first, there is no question of their being the wrong rules for\nthe expressions—everybody is at liberty to build his own logic,\nto choose whatever rules he likes—and second, to be tolerant\nabout language choice is already to be tolerant about choice of\nlogic—for languages so-conceived come with different logics\nalready ‘built in.’  \nOne of Carnap’s reasons for accepting logical pluralism is that he saw\nit as making space for innovation in logic. In the foreword to The\nLogical Syntax of Language he writes:  \nUp to the present, there has been only a very slight deviation, in a\nfew points here and there, from the form of language developed by\nRussell which has already become classical. For instance, certain\nsentential forms (such as unlimited existential sentences) and rules\nof inference (such as the Law of Excluded Middle), have been\neliminated by certain authors. On the other hand, a number of\nextensions have been attempted, and several interesting, many-valued\ncalculi analogous to the two-valued calculus of sentences have been\nevolved, and have resulted finally in a logic of probability.\nLikewise, so-called intensional sentences have been introduced and,\nwith their aid a logic of modality developed. The fact that no\nattempts have been made to venture still further from the classical\nforms is perhaps due to the widely held opinion that any such\ndeviations must be justified—that is, the new language-form must\nbe proved to be ‘correct’ and to constitute a faithful\nrendering of ‘the true logic’. \nTo eliminate this standpoint, together with the pseudo-problems and\nwearisome controversies with arise as a result of it, is one of the\nchief tasks of this book. (Carnap 1937) \nThis passage highlights several features of Carnap’s logical pluralism\nand philosophy of logic more generally. It seems clear that he\nintended his logical pluralism to be both\n‘horizontal’—that is, to allow for different logics\nat the same level, such as classical and intuitionist sentential\nlogics—as well as ‘vertical’—allowing for\nlogics for new kinds of expression, such as intensional logics and\nsecond-order logic (the terminology is from Eklund 2012). Furthermore\nthe passage expresses a “logic-first” approach, and\nrejects a “philosophy-first” approach, suggesting that\nrather than trying to figure out which is the best logic a priori from\nfirst principles (the ‘philosophy-first’ approach), we\nshould let logicians develop languages as they like, and then make our\njudgements based on how things turn out.  \nThe most obvious contrast here is with W.V.O. Quine, who criticised\nsecond-order logic as “set-theory in sheep’s clothing” and\nrejected tense and modal logics on philosophical grounds (Quine 1986\n(Chapter 5), 1953, 1966; Burgess 1997, 2012). Such a stand-off is\nquite intriguing, given Quine’s rejection of such\n“Philosophy-First” approaches in epistemology more\ngenerally.  \nA number of contemporary writers have been happy to endorse Carnap’s\napproach to pluralism and Restall argues that it is less radical than\nhis and JC Beall’s case-based version (Varzi 2002, 199; Restall 2002).\nNonetheless there are several issues that someone who wanted to defend\nCarnap’s position today would need to address. A first concern about\nthe view is that while we are working within the various languages we\ninvent, we could be missing the ‘correct’ rules—the\nones that were out there, in effect, before we invented anything. In\nthe words of Paul Boghossian,  \nAre we really to suppose that, prior to our stipulating a meaning for\nthe sentence ‘Either snow is white or it isn’t.’ it wasn’t\nthe case that either snow was white or it wasn’t? Isn’t it\noverwhelmingly obvious that this claim was true before such an act of\nmeaning, and that it would have been true even if no one had thought\nabout it, or chosen it to be expressed by one of our sentences?\n(Boghossian 1996) \nCarnap would perhaps not have taken this objection seriously, since,\nlike the Wittgenstein of the Tractatus (e.g., §4.26,\n4.641–4.465), he does not believe that logical truths and rules\nare ‘out there’, waiting to be discovered:  \nThe so-called ‘real’ sentences, constitute the core of the\nscience; the mathematico-logical sentences are analytic, with no real\ncontent, and are merely formal auxiliaries. (Carnap 1937, xiv) \nNonetheless, such a ‘conventionalist’ view of logical\ntruth (and along with it, analytic truth) has been argued against by,\nfor example, Quine, Sober, Yablo and Boghossian, and it no longer\nenjoys the popularity that it had in Carnap’s time (Quine 1936; Yablo\n1992; Boghossian 1996; Sober 2000). It also highlights the extent to\nwhich it is odd to call Carnap a logical pluralist, since in a way his\nview is not that there is more than one correct logic, but that there\nis nothing for logic to be correct about (Cook 2010, 498). Perhaps it\nwould be more illuminating to call Carnap a logical constructivist.\n \nAnother issue is whether Carnap’s conception of meaning is correct.\nThese days there are many alternative approaches to meaning and lively\ndebate about them. Field writes:  \nOn some readings of “differ in meaning”, any big\ndifference in theory generates a difference in meaning. On such\nreadings, the connectives do indeed differ in meaning between\nadvocates of the different all-purpose logics, just as\n‘electron’ differs in meaning between Thomson’s theory and\nRutherford’s; but Rutherford’s theory disagrees with Thomson’s despite\nthis difference in meaning, and it is unclear why we shouldn’t say the\nsame thing about alternative all-purpose logics. (Field 2009) \nField concludes that “the notion of difference of meaning is\nunhelpful in the context” and that Carnap’s view of the meanings\nof the logical contexts is therefore hard to defend.  \nBut proponents of particular alternative views about the meanings of\nthe logical constants might instead hold that they can make good sense\nof difference in meaning in these contexts, and that Carnap has simply\nendorsed the wrong theory of meaning and as a result drawn the wrong\nconclusions for logic. One specific issue that they might point to is\nassociated with Prior’s 1960 paper “The Runabout Inference\nTicket”, in which he provides rules for a new connective,\ntonk, which quickly lead to triviality, suggesting that he\nwas not quite “at liberty to build his own logic” by\nintroducing rules for his expressions. Another issue is the fact that\none can generate different logics, not by varying the rules governing\nany particular expression, but rather by varying the more general\nstructural rules of the logic, which govern things like whether or not\none is allowed multiple conclusions, and whether or not a premise can\nbe used more than once in a proof (Restall 2000; Paoli 2003). This\nsuggests that even if the meanings of the logical expressions are\ngoverned by the rules that tell you how they can be used in proofs (as\nCarnap suggests) two logics can agree on those rules, whilst\ndisagreeing on the relation of logical consequence. Hence even if you\nhave successfully chosen a language, it seems that you might not yet\nhave determined a logic.  \nSeveral other varieties of logical pluralism have been proposed since\nBeall and Restall’s early work, and five are outlined in this section.\nA useful way to classify these different views—including Beall and\nRestall’s case-based pluralism—is as each taking logical consequence\nto be relative to a different feature—e.g. precisifications\nof ‘case’ (for Beall and Restall), sets of logical constants (for\nVarzi), kinds of truth-bearer (for Russell), goals (for Cook’s less\nradical approach), and epistemic norms (for\n Field’s).[6]\n  \nOccasionally it is objected that one or more of these views does not\nconstitute a ‘real’ logical pluralism, on the grounds that it merely\nrelativises consequence to some new parameter, and (the objection\ncontinues) this would make the view a form of relativism, rather than\na form of\n pluralism.[7]\n But it is worth remembering that not just some but most of\nthe views standardly discussed under the heading of logical\npluralism—including the most central case-based\nversions—can be understood as relativising logical consequence\nto something distinctive. They they are standardly described as\nlogical pluralisms anyway, presumably because they are views on which\nit can reasonably be claimed that more than one logic is correct. The\nliterature is thus easier to follow if one doesn’t assume that the\nwords “pluralism” and “relativism” to mark an important or widely\nagreed-upon distinction (Shapiro 2014, p. 1). \nAchille Varzi points out that one way to generate competing relations\nof logical consequence is to vary the set of expressions that we treat\nas logical constants. If we take = to be a logical constant, then the\nfollowing argument will be valid  \nBut if the set of logical constants does not include = then it will\nnot, since our models will now include those that assign non-reflexive\nrelations to =, and these can generate counter-examples.  \nShould = be treated as a logical constant? Tarski himself endorsed the\nview that any expression in the language might be taken to be\nlogical:  \nThe division of all terms of the language discussed into logical and\nextra-logical … is certainly not quite arbitrary. If, for\nexample, we were to include among the extra-logical signs the\nimplication sign, or the universal quantifier, then our definition of\nthe concept of consequence would lead to results which obviously\ncontradict ordinary usage. On the other hand no objective grounds are\nknown to me which permit us to draw a sharp boundary between the two\ngroups of terms. It seems to me possible to include among the logical\nterms some which are usually regarded by logicians as extra-logical\nwithout running into consequences which stand in sharp contrast to\nordinary usage. … In the extreme case we could regard all terms\nof the language as logical. (Tarski 1983, 418–419) \nVarzi is inclined to endorse Tarski’s liberalism with respect to the\nchoice of logical constants:  \nThe relevant claim is that all (or any) terms of the language could in\nprinciple be regarded “as logical”—and I agree with\nthat. (Varzi 2002, 200) \nThe result is that on his view there is more than one correct relation\nof logical consequence, since that relation is relative to the choice\nof logical constants, and there is more than one equally correct set\nof these, resulting in different, equally correct logics.  \nThe Tarksi/Varzi view is controversial. Varzi defends it in his paper\nof 2002 and there is useful discussion in MacFarlane 2009.  \nAnother variety of logical pluralism results if we consider that there\nmight be different correct logics for different kinds of truth-bearer,\nas is argued in (Russell 2008). Suppose that logical consequence is\nindeed a matter of truth-preservation over cases. Then we could\ncoherently talk of truth-preservation relations on (sets of)\nsentences, on (sets of) propositions, or on (sets of) characters (as\nin Kaplan 1989) and ultimately on any truth-bearer whatsoever. This\nwould not be very exciting if those logics all turned out to determine\na single ‘parallel’ consequence relation, so that, for\nexample, a sentence S1 had a sentence\nS2 as a logical consequence if and only if the\nproposition it expressed, P1, had the proposition\nexpressed by S2 (P2) as a logical\nconsequence. Russell uses various examples involving names, rigidity,\ndirect reference, and indexicals to argue that this is not always the\ncase. To take just one, on the assumption that the sentence\na=b contains two different, directly referential names,\na = b and a = a express the same\nproposition. Given the minimal assumption that the relation of logical\nconsequence is reflexive, that means that proposition expressed by\na = b is a logical consequence of the proposition\nexpressed by a = a, even though the sentence a =\nb is not a logical consequence of the sentence a = a. Hence the\nrelation of logical consequence on sentences is interestingly\ndifferent from that of the relation of logical consequence on\npropositions, and there are at least two different, correct relations\nof logical consequence.  \nShapiro and Cook have suggested that the job of a formal logic is to\nmodel a natural language (Shapiro 2006; Cook 2010; Shapiro 2014).\nSince models are simplified structures intended to exhibit some but\nnot all of the features of the phenomenon being modelled, there may be\nseveral rival models of the same language, each capturing different\naspects of that language, and as Shapiro writes:  \n…with mathematical models generally, there is typically no\nquestion of ‘getting it exactly right’. For a given\npurpose, there may be bad models—models that are clearly\nincorrect—and there may be good models, but it is unlikely that\none can speak of one and only one correct model. (Shapiro 2006) \nThis sounds like it might support a species of logical\nnihilism—a view on which there is no correct logic (and\nin fact Cotnoir (2019 explores that view)—but Cook prefers to\nthink of it as offering two different kinds of pluralism. The first,\nless controversial, kind holds that which logic is the correct one is\nrelative to one’s goal. If one wants to study vagueness, the correct\nlogic might be one that allows for intermediate truth-values, whereas\nif one wants to study identity, perhaps first-order classical logic\nwith identity is to be preferred. Since the correct model is relative\nto your goal, so is the correct logic.  \nBut Cook wonders whether his and Shapiro’s logic-as-modelling view\ncould also support a more radical pluralism, since it seems possible\nthat even relative to a specific purpose, there could be two rival\nlogics, each clearly better than all the rest relative to that\npurpose, yet neither of which is better than the other. Under such\ncircumstances Cook thinks we might want to say that both are correct,\nand hence that there is more than one correct logic. However one could\nalso hold that in such circumstances there are two equally good\nlogics, neither of which counts as correct.  \nHartry Field proposes another kind of logical pluralism (Field 2009).\nThe view rests on the thesis that logic is normative (see\n §1.4)\n along with a pluralism about epistemic normativity. Field holds that\nthere are many possible epistemic norms, and that we might think of\nagents as endorsing one, or—more likely—different norms at\ndifferent times, and as having views about how good different possible\nepistemic norms are. We use these epistemic norms to evaluate\nthemselves, and other norms (think of using numerical induction to\nevaluate both induction and counter-induction.) Some norms do well by\ntheir own lights, in which case we feel no tension. Some do badly even\nby their own lights, in which case we feel pressure to change them.\nThere’s no sense, on Field’s view, in regarding any of these norms\nas correct or incorrect, but he does think that it makes sense to call\nthem better or worse, so long as we recognize that these evaluations\nare relative to our epistemic goals. Still, though this makes norms\ncriticizable and evaluable, it doesn’t mean that there will be a\nuniquely best norm. “For instance, there might be a sequence of\nbetter and better norms for achieving the goals; in addition, there\nmight be ties and/or incomparabilities ‘arbitrarily far\nup’” (355). Hence we have an epistemic normative\npluralism. \nSimilarly, we can use our epistemic norms—including deductive\nlogics—to evaluate how well various deductive logics perform in\nachieving epistemic goals we have, e.g. resolving the semantic\nparadoxes. And again “it isn’t obvious that there need be a\nuniquely best logic for a given goal, much less that we should think\nof one logic as ”uniquely correct“ in some goal independent\nsense” (356). The result then, is a kind of logical pluralism:\nlogics are better or worse relative to different goals, but even\nrelative to a particular goal, it might be that no single logic\nis the unique best one.  \nFinally, Hjortland explores another kind of logical pluralism in\ndefending sub-classical logics from Williamson’s abductive argument\nthat classical logic is the One True Logic (Hjortland 2017,\n652–657; Williamson 2017). Consider the claim that the\nubiquitous use of classical logic (rather than other weaker\nlogics) in mathematics is a strong point in its favour; if we had to\ngive up classical logic, we might be worried about losing a lot of\nelegant, simple and otherwise virtuous mathematical theories, and\npreserving virtuous theories (and letting go of ad hoc and otherwise\nvicious theories) is what the abductive approach in logic is all\nabout. \nHowever, the move from the importance of classical logic in\nmathematics to the truth of classical logic is much too fast. It is\none thing to say that classical logic, including say, instances of the\nprinciples of Double Negation Elimination (DNE) and ex falso quodlibet\n(EFQ), are widely used in mathematics. But mathematics does not\nrequire any principles with the full strength and generality of\nclassical logic’s (DNE) and (EFQ)—it only uses some of the\ninstances of those principles, the instances that employ\nmathematical language. When we say that (DNE) and (LEM) are\nlogically valid we are saying that they are valid no matter\nwhat expressions we substitute for the non-logical expressions in\nthem—including extra-mathematical vague predicates like ‘heap’ or\n‘red’ and notoriously troublesome metalinguistic predicates like\n‘true’ and ‘heterological’. \nThat leaves space for a kind of pluralism that holds that some of the\nstronger logical principles are correct only when they are restricted\nto particular kinds of linguistic expression (such as those that\nfeature in the language of Peano Arithmetic); if we don’t restrict\nthem in this way, there will be counterexamples. Other logical\nprinciples (perhaps conjunction elimination is on this list) do not\nneed to be restricted to the language of Peano Arithmetic. This leaves\nus with a clear sense in which we have different correct logics,\ndepending on which language we are assuming.
