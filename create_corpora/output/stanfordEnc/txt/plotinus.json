He is one of the most influential\nphilosophers in antiquity after Plato and Aristotle.  The term\n‘Neoplatonism’ is an invention of early 19th\ncentury European scholarship and indicates the penchant of historians\nfor dividing ‘periods’ in history.  In this case, the term\nwas intended to indicate that Plotinus initiated a new phase in the\ndevelopment of the Platonic tradition.  What this\n‘newness’ amounted to, if anything, is controversial,\nlargely because one’s assessment of it depends upon one’s\nassessment of what Platonism is.  In fact, Plotinus (like all his\nsuccessors) regarded himself simply as a Platonist, that is, as an\nexpositor and defender of the philosophical position whose greatest\nexponent was Plato himself.  Originality was thus not held as a\npremium by Plotinus.  Nevertheless, Plotinus realized that Plato\nneeded to be interpreted.  In addition, between Plato and himself,\nPlotinus found roughly 600 years of philosophical writing, much of it\nreflecting engagement with Plato and the tradition of philosophy he\ninitiated.  Consequently, there were at least two avenues for\noriginality open to Plotinus, even if it was not his intention to say\nfundamentally new things.  The first was in trying to say what Plato\nmeant on the basis of what he wrote or said or what others reported\nhim to have said.  This was the task of exploring the philosophical\nposition that we happen to call ‘Platonism’.  The second\nwas in defending Plato against those who, Plotinus thought, had\nmisunderstood him and therefore unfairly criticized him.  Plotinus\nfound himself, especially as a teacher, taking up these two avenues.\nHis originality must be sought for by following his path.\n\n\n Owing to the unusually fulsome biography by Plotinus’ disciple\nPorphyry, we know more about Plotinus’ life than we do about most\nancient philosophers’.  The main facts are these. \n Plotinus was born in Lycopolis, Egypt in 204 or 205 C.E.  When he was\n28, a growing interest in philosophy led him to the feet of one\nAmmonius Saccas in Alexandria.  After ten or eleven years with this\nobscure though evidently dominating figure, Plotinus was moved to\nstudy Persian and Indian philosophy.  In order to do so, he attached\nhimself to the military expedition of Emperor Gordian III to Persia in\n243.  The expedition was aborted when Gordian was assassinated by his\ntroops.  Plotinus thereupon seems to have abandoned his plans, making\nhis way to Rome in 245.  There he remained until his death in 270 or\n271. \n Porphyry informs us that during the first ten years of his time in\nRome, Plotinus lectured exclusively on the philosophy of Ammonius.\nDuring this time he also wrote nothing.  Porphyry tells us that when\nhe himself arrived in Rome in 263, the first 21 of Plotinus’ treatises\nhad already been written.  The remainder of the 54 treatises\nconstituting his Enneads were written in the last seven or\neight years of his life. \n Porphyry’s biography reveals a man at once otherworldly and deeply\npractical.  The former is hardly surprising in a philosopher but the\nlatter deserves to be noted and is impressively indicated by the fact\nthat a number of Plotinus’ acquaintances appointed him as guardian to\ntheir children when they died. \n Plotinus’ writings were edited by Porphyry (there was perhaps another\nedition by Plotinus’ physician, Eustochius, though all traces of it\nare lost).  It is to Porphyry that we owe the somewhat artificial\ndivision of the writings into six groups of nine (hence the name\nEnneads from the Greek word for ‘nine’).  In fact,\nthere are somewhat fewer than 54 (Porphyry artificially divided some\nof them into separately numbered ‘treatises’), and the\nactual number of these is of no significance.  The arrangement of the\ntreatises is also owing to Porphyry and does evince an ordering\nprinciple.  Ennead I contains, roughly, ethical discussions;\nEnneads II–III contain discussions of natural philosophy and\ncosmology (though III 4, 5, 7, 8 do not fit into this rubric so\neasily); Ennead IV is devoted to matters of psychology;\nEnnead V, to epistemological matters, especially the intellect;\nand Ennead VI, to numbers, being in general, and the One above\nintellect, the first principle of all.  It is to be emphasized that\nthe ordering is Porphyry’s.  The actual chronological ordering, which\nPorphyry also provides for us, does not correspond at all to the\nordering in the edition.  For example, Ennead I 1 is the\n53rd treatise chronologically, one of the last things\nPlotinus wrote. \n These works vary in size from a couple of pages to over a hundred.\nThey seem to be occasional writings in the sense that they constitute\nwritten responses by Plotinus to questions and problems raised in his\nregular seminars.  Sometimes these questions and problems guide the\nentire discussion, so that it is sometimes difficult to tell when\nPlotinus is writing in his own voice or expressing the views of\nsomeone else.  Typically, Plotinus would at his seminars have read out\npassages from Platonic or Aristotelian commentators, it being assumed\nthat the members of the seminar were already familiar with the primary\ntexts.  Then a discussion of the text along with the problems it\nraised occurred. \n One must not suppose that the study of Aristotle at these seminars\nbelonged to a separate ‘course’ on the great successor of\nPlato.  After Plotinus, in fact Aristotle was studied on his own as\npreparation for studying Plato.  But with Plotinus, Aristotle, it\nseems, was assumed to be himself one of the most effective expositors\nof Plato.  Studying both Aristotle’s own philosophy as explained by\ncommentators such as Alexander of Aphrodisias (2nd –\nearly 3rd c. C.E.) and his explicit objections to Plato was\na powerful aid in understanding the master’s philosophy.  In part,\nthis was owing to the fact that Aristotle was assumed to know Plato’s\nphilosophy at first hand and to have recorded it, including Plato’s\n‘unwritten teachings’.  In addition, later Greek\nhistorians of philosophy tell us that Plotinus’ teacher, Ammonius\nSaccas, was among those Platonists who assumed that in some sense\nAristotle’s philosophy was in harmony with Platonism.  This harmony\ndid not preclude disagreements between Aristotle and Plato.  Nor did\nit serve to prevent misunderstandings of Platonism on Aristotle’s\npart.  Nevertheless, Plotinus’ wholesale adoption of many Aristotelian\narguments and distinctions will seem less puzzling when we realize\nthat he took these both as compatible with Platonism and as useful for\narticulating the Platonic position, especially in areas in which Plato\nwas himself not explicit. \n The three basic principles of Plotinus’ metaphysics are called by him\n‘the One’ (or, equivalently, ‘the Good’),\nIntellect, and Soul (see V 1; V 9.).  These principles are both\nultimate ontological realities and explanatory principles.  Plotinus\nbelieved that they were recognized by Plato as such, as well as by the\nentire subsequent Platonic tradition. \n The One is the absolutely simple first principle of all.  It is both\n‘self-caused’ and the cause of being for everything else\nin the universe.  There are, according to Plotinus, various ways of\nshowing the necessity of positing such a principle.  These are all\nrooted in the Pre-Socratic philosophical/scientific tradition.  A\ncentral axiom of that tradition was the connecting of explanation with\nreductionism or the derivation of the complex from the simple. That\nis, ultimate explanations of phenomena and of contingent entities can\nonly rest in what itself requires no explanation.  If what is actually\nsought is the explanation for something that is in one way or another\ncomplex, what grounds the explanation will be simple relative to the\nobserved complexity.  Thus, what grounds an explanation must be\ndifferent from the sorts of things explained by it.  According to this\nline of reasoning, explanantia that are themselves complex,\nperhaps in some way different from the sort of complexity of the\nexplananda, will be in need of other types of explanation.  In\naddition, a plethora of explanatory principles will themselves be in\nneed of explanation.  Taken to its logical conclusion, the explanatory\npath must finally lead to that which is unique and absolutely\nuncomplex. \n The One is such a principle.  Plotinus found it in Plato’s\nRepublic where it is named ‘the Idea of the Good’\nand in his Parmenides where it is the subject of a series of\ndeductions (137c ff.).  The One or the Good, owing to its simplicity,\nis indescribable directly.  We can only grasp it indirectly by\ndeducing what it is not (see V 3. 14; VI 8; VI 9. 3).  Even the names\n‘One’ and ‘Good’ are fautes de mieux.\nTherefore, it is wrong to see the One as a principle of oneness or\ngoodness, in the sense in which these are intelligible attributes.\nThe name ‘One’ is least inappropriate because it best\nsuggests absolute simplicity. \n If the One is absolutely simple, how can it be the cause of the being\nof anything much less the cause of everything?  The One is such a\ncause in the sense that it is virtually everything else (see III 8. 1;\nV 1. 7, 9; V 3. 15, 33; VI 9. 5, 36). This means that it stands to\neverything else as, for example, white light stands to the colors of\nthe rainbow, or the way in which a properly functioning calculator may\nbe said to contain all the answers to the questions that can be\nlegitimately put to it.  Similarly, an omniscient simple deity may be\nsaid to know virtually all that is knowable. In general, if A is\nvirtually B, then A is both simpler in its existence than B and able\nto produce B.  \n The causality of the One was frequently explained in antiquity as an\nanswer to the question, ‘How do we derive a many from the\nOne?’ Although the answer provided by Plotinus and by other\nNeoplatonists is sometimes expressed in the language of\n‘emanation’, it is very easy to mistake this for what it\nis not.  It is not intended to indicate either a temporal process or\nthe unpacking or separating of a potentially complex unity.  Rather,\nthe derivation was understood in terms of atemporal ontological\ndependence. \n The first derivation from the One is Intellect.  Intellect is the\nlocus of the full array of Platonic Forms, those eternal and immutable\nentities that account for or explain the possibility of intelligible\npredication.  Plotinus assumes that without such Forms, there would be\nno non-arbitrary justification for saying that anything had one\nproperty rather than another.  Whatever properties things have, they\nhave owing to there being Forms whose instances these properties are.\nBut that still leaves us with the very good question of why an eternal\nand immutable Intellect is necessarily postulated along with these\nForms. \n The historical answer to this question is in part that Plotinus\nassumed that he was following Plato who, in Timaeus (30c;\ncf. Philebus 22c), claimed that the Form of Intelligible Animal\nwas eternally contemplated by an intellect called ‘the\nDemiurge’.  This contemplation Plotinus interpreted as cognitive\nidentity, since if the Demiurge were contemplating something outside\nof itself, what would be inside of itself would be only an image or\nrepresentation of eternal reality (see V 5) – and so, it would not\nactually know what it contemplates, as that is in itself.\n‘Cognitive identity’ then means that when Intellect is\nthinking, it is thinking itself.  Further, Plotinus believed that\nAristotle, in book 12 of his Metaphysics and in book 3 of his\nDe Anima supported both the eternality of Intellect (in\nAristotle represented as the Unmoved Mover) and the idea that\ncognitive identity characterized its operation. \n Philosophically, Plotinus argued that postulating Forms without a\nsuperordinate principle, the One, which is virtually what all the\nForms are, would leave the Forms in eternal disunity.  If this were\nthe case, then there could be no necessary truth, for all necessary\ntruths, e.g., 3 + 5 = 8, express a virtual identity, as indicated here\nby the ‘=’ sign.  Consider the analogy of\nthree-dimensionality and solidity.  Why are these necessarily\nconnected in a body such that there could not be a body that had one\nwithout the other?  The answer is that body is virtually\nthree-dimensionality and virtually solidity.  Both\nthree-dimensionality and solidity express in different ways what a\nbody is. \n The role of Intellect is to account for the real distinctness of the\nplethora of Forms, virtually united in the One.  Thus, in the above\nmathematical example, the fact that numbers are virtually united does\nnot gainsay the fact that each has an identity.  The way that identity\nis maintained is by each and every Form being thought by an eternal\nIntellect.  And in this thinking, Intellect ‘attains’ the\nOne in the only way it possibly can.  It attains all that can be\nthought; hence, all that can be thought ‘about’ the\nOne. \n Intellect is the principle of essence or whatness or intelligibility\nas the One is the principle of being.  Intellect is an eternal\ninstrument of the One’s causality (see V 4. 1, 1–4; VI 7. 42, 21–23).\nThe dependence of anything ‘below’ Intellect is owing to\nthe One’s ultimate causality along with Intellect, which explains, via\nthe Forms, why that being is the kind of thing it is.  Intellect needs\nthe One as cause of its being in order for Intellect to be a\nparadigmatic cause and the One needs Intellect in order for there to\nbe anything with an intelligible structure.  Intellect could not\nsuffice as a first principle of all because the complexity of thinking\n(thinker and object of thought and multiplicity of objects of thought)\nrequires as an explanation something that is absolutely simple.  In\naddition, the One may even be said to need Intellect to produce\nIntellect.  This is so because Plotinus distinguishes two logical\n‘phases’ of Intellect’s production from the One (see V\n1. 7).  The first phase indicates the fundamental activity of\nintellection or thinking; the second, the actualization of thinking\nwhich constitutes the being of the Forms.  This thinking is the way\nIntellect ‘returns’ to the One. \n The third fundamental principle is Soul.  Soul is not the\nprinciple of life, for the activity of Intellect is the highest\nactivity of life.  Plotinus associates life with desire.  But in the\nhighest life, the life of Intellect, where we find the highest form of\ndesire, that desire is eternally satisfied by contemplation of the One\nthrough the entire array of Forms that are internal to it.\nSoul is the principle of desire for objects that are external\nto the agent of desire.  Everything with a soul, from human beings to\nthe most insignificant plant, acts to satisfy desire.  This desire\nrequires it to seek things that are external to it, such as food.\nEven a desire for sleep, for example, is a desire for a state other\nthan the state which the living thing currently is in.  Cognitive\ndesires, for example, the desire to know, are desires for that which\nis currently not present to the agent.  A desire to procreate is, as\nPlato pointed out, a desire for immortality.  Soul explains, as\nunchangeable Intellect could not, the deficiency that is implicit in\nthe fact of desiring. \n Soul is related to Intellect analogously to the way Intellect is\nrelated to the One.  As the One is virtually what Intellect is, so\nIntellect is paradigmatically what Soul is.  The activity of\nIntellect, or its cognitive identity with all Forms, is the paradigm\nfor all embodied cognitive states of any soul as well as any of its\naffective states.  In the first case, a mode of cognition, such as\nbelief, images Intellect’s eternal state by being a\nrepresentational state.  It represents the cognitive identity of\nIntellect with Forms because the embodied believer is cognitively\nidentical with a concept which itself represents or images Forms.  In\nthe second case, an affective state such as feeling tired represents\nor images Intellect (in a derived way) owing to the cognitive\ncomponent of that state which consists in the recognition of its own\npresence.  Here, x’s being-in-the-state is the\nintentional object of x’s cognition.  Where the affective\nstate is that of a non-cognitive agent, the imitation is even more\nremote, though present nevertheless.  It is, says Plotinus, like the\nstate of being asleep in comparison with the state of being awake (see\nIII 8. 4).  In other words, it is a state that produces desire that is\nin potency a state that recognizes the presence of the desire, a state\nwhich represents the state of Intellect. In reply to the possible\nobjection that a potency is not an image of actuality, Plotinus will\nwant to insist that potencies are functionally related to actualities,\nnot the other way around, and that therefore the affective states of\nnon-cognitive agents can only be understood as derived versions of the\naffective and cognitive states of souls closer to the ideal of both,\nnamely, the state of Intellect. \n There is another way in which Soul is related to Intellect as\nIntellect is related to the One.  Plotinus distinguishes between\nsomething’s internal and external activity (see V 4. 2, 27–33).  The\n(indescribable) internal activity of the One is its own\nhyper-intellectual existence.  Its external activity is just\nIntellect.  Similarly, Intellect’s internal activity is its\ncontemplation of the Forms, and its external activity is found in\nevery possible representation of the activity of being eternally\nidentical with all that is intelligible (i.e., the Forms).  It is also\nfound in the activity of soul, which as a principle of\n‘external’ desire images the paradigmatic desire of\nIntellect.  Anything that is understandable is an external activity of\nIntellect; and any form of cognition of that is also an external\nactivity of it.  The internal activity of Soul includes the plethora\nof psychical activities of all embodied living things.  The external\nactivity of Soul is nature, which is just the intelligible structure\nof all that is other than soul in the sensible world, including both\nthe bodies of things with soul and things without soul (see III 8. 2).\nThe end of this process of diminishing activities is matter which is\nentirely bereft of form and so of intelligibility, but whose existence\nis ultimately owing to the One, via the instrumentality of Intellect\nand Soul.  \n According to Plotinus, matter is to be identified with evil and\nprivation of all form or intelligibility (see II 4).  Plotinus holds\nthis in conscious opposition to Aristotle, who distinguished matter\nfrom privation (see II 4. 16, 3–8).  Matter is what accounts for the\ndiminished reality of the sensible world, for all natural things are\ncomposed of forms in matter.  The fact that matter is in principle\ndeprived of all intelligibility and is still ultimately dependent on\nthe One is an important clue as to how the causality of the latter\noperates.   \n If matter or evil is ultimately caused by the One, then is not the\nOne, as the Good, the cause of evil?  In one sense, the answer is\ndefinitely yes.  As Plotinus reasons, if anything besides the One is\ngoing to exist, then there must be a conclusion of the process of\nproduction from the One.  The beginning of evil is the act of\nseparation from the One by Intellect, an act which the One itself\nultimately causes.  The end of the process of production from the One\ndefines a limit, like the end of a river going out from its sources.\nBeyond the limit is matter or evil. \n We may still ask why the limitless is held to be evil.  According to\nPlotinus, matter is the condition for the possibility of there being\nimages of Forms in the sensible world.  From this perspective, matter\nis identified with the receptacle or space in Plato’s Timaeus\nand the phenomenal properties in the receptacle prior to the\nimposition of order by the Demiurge.  The very possibility of a\nsensible world, which is impressively confirmed by the fact that there\nis one, guarantees that the production from the One, which must\ninclude all that is possible (else the One would be self-limiting),\nalso include the sensible world (see I 8. 7).  But the sensible world\nconsists of images of the intelligible world and these images could\nnot exist without matter. \n Matter is only evil in other than a purely metaphysical sense when it\nbecomes an impediment to return to the One.  It is evil when\nconsidered as a goal or end that is a polar opposite to the Good.  To\ndeny the necessity of evil is to deny the necessity of the Good (I 8.\n15).  Matter is only evil for entities that can consider it as a goal\nof desire.  These are, finally, only entities that can be\nself-conscious of their goals.  Specifically, human beings, by opting\nfor attachments to the bodily, orient themselves in the direction of\nevil.  This is not because body itself is evil.  The evil in bodies is\nthe element in them that is not dominated by form.  One may be\ndesirous of that form, but in that case what one truly desires is that\nform’s ultimate intelligible source in Intellect.  More typically,\nattachment to the body represents a desire not for form but a corrupt\ndesire for the non-intelligible or limitless.  \n The drama of human life is viewed by Plotinus against the axis of\nGood and evil outlined above.  The human person is essentially a soul\nemploying a body as an instrument of its temporary embodied life (see\nI 1).  Thus, Plotinus distinguishes between the person and the\ncomposite of soul and body.  That person is identical with a cognitive\nagent or subject of cognitive states (see I 1. 7).  An embodied person\nis, therefore, a conflicted entity, capable both of thought and of\nbeing the subject of the composite’s non-cognitive states, such as\nappetites and emotions. \n This conflicted state or duality of personhood is explained by the\nnature of cognition, including rational desire.  Rational agents are\ncapable of being in embodied states, including states of desire, and\nof being cognitively aware that they are in these states.  So, a\nperson can be hungry or tired and be cognitively aware that he is in\nthis state, where cognitive awareness includes being able to\nconceptualize that state.  But Plotinus holds that the state of\ncognitive awareness more closely identifies the person than does the\nnon-cognitive state.  He does so on the grounds that all embodied or\nenmattered intelligible reality is an image of its eternal paradigm in\nIntellect.  In fact, the highest part of the person, one’s own\nintellect, the faculty in virtue of which persons can engage in\nnon-discursive thinking, is eternally ‘undescended’.  It\nis eternally doing what Intellect is doing.  And the reason for\nholding this is, based on Plotinus’ interpretation of Plato’s\nRecollection Argument in Phaedo (72e-78b), that our ability to\nengage successfully in embodied cognition depends on our having access\nto Forms.  But the only access to Forms is eternal access by cognitive\nidentification with them.  Otherwise, we would have only images or\nrepresentations of the Forms.  So, we must now be cognitively\nidentical with them if we are going also to use these Forms as a way\nof classifying and judging things in the sensible world. \n A person in a body can choose to take on the role of a non-cognitive\nagent by acting solely on appetite or emotion.  In doing so, that\nperson manifests a corrupted desire, a desire for what is evil, the\nmaterial aspect of the bodily.  Alternatively, a person can distance\nhimself from these desires and identify himself with his rational\nself.  The very fact that this is possible supplies Plotinus with\nanother argument for the supersensible identity of the person. \n Owing to the conflicted states of embodied persons, they are subject\nto self-contempt and yet, paradoxically, ‘want to belong to\nthemselves’.  Persons have contempt for themselves because one\nhas contempt for what is inferior to oneself.  Insofar as persons\ndesire things other than what Intellect desires, they desire things\nthat are external to themselves.  But the subject of such desires is\ninferior to what is desired, even if this be a state of fulfilled\ndesire.  In other words, if someone wants to be in state B when he is\nin state A, he must regard being in state A as worse than being in\nstate B.  But all states of embodied desire are like this.  Hence, the\nself-contempt. \n Persons want to belong to themselves insofar as they identify\nthemselves as subjects of their idiosyncratic desires.  They do this\nbecause they have forgotten or are unaware of their true identity as\ndisembodied intellects.  If persons recognize their true identity,\nthey would not be oriented to the objects of their embodied desire but\nto the objects of intellect.  They would be able to look upon the\nsubject of those embodied desires as alien to their true selves. \n   Plotinus views ethics according to the criterion of what\ncontributes to our identification with our higher selves and what\ncontributes to our separation from that identification.  All virtuous\npractices make a positive contribution to this goal.  But virtues can\nbe graded according to how they do this (see I 2).  The lowest form of\nvirtues, what Plotinus, following Plato, calls ‘civic’ or\n‘popular’, are the practices that serve to control the\nappetites (see I 2. 2).  By contrast, higher\n‘purificatory’ virtues are those that separate the person\nfrom the embodied human being (I 2. 3).  One who practices\npurificatory virtue is no longer subject to the incontinent desires\nwhose restraint constitutes mere civic or popular virtue.  Such a\nperson achieves a kind of ‘likeness to God’ recommended by\nPlato at Theaetetus 176a-b.  Both of these types of virtue are\ninferior to intellectual virtue which consists in the activity of the\nphilosopher (see I 2. 6).  One who is purified in embodied practices\ncan turn unimpeded to one’s true self-identity as a thinker. \n\nPlotinus, however, while acknowledging the necessity of virtuous\nliving for happiness, refuses to identify them.  Like Aristotle,\nPlotinus maintains that a property of the happy life is its\nself-sufficiency (see I.1.4–5).  But Plotinus does not agree that a\nlife focused on the practice of virtue is self-sufficient.  Even\nAristotle concedes that such a life is not self-sufficient in the\nsense that it is immune to misfortune.  Plotinus, insisting that the\nbest life is one that is in fact blessed owing precisely to its\nimmunity to misfortune, alters the meaning of\n‘self-sufficient’ in order to identify it with the\ninterior life of the excellent person.  This interiority or\nself-sufficiency is the obverse of attachment to the objects of\nembodied desires.  Interiority is happiness because the longing for\nthe Good, for one who is ideally an intellect, is satisfied by\ncognitive identification with all that is intelligible.  If this is\nnot unqualifiedly possible for the embodied human being, it does at\nleast seem possible that one should have a second order desire,\nderiving from this longing for the Good, that amounts to a profound\nindifference to the satisfaction of first order desires.\nUnderstanding that the good for an intellect is contemplation of all\nthat the One is means that the will is oriented to one thing only,\nwhatever transient desires may turn up. \nPlotinus’ chronologically first treatise, ‘On Beauty’ (I\n6), can be seen as parallel to his treatise on virtue (I 2).  In it,\nhe tries to fit the experience of beauty into the drama of ascent to\nthe first principle of all.  In this respect, Plotinus’ aesthetics is\ninseparable from his metaphysics, psychology, and ethics. \nAs in the case of virtue, Plotinus recognizes a hierarchy of beauty.\nBut what all types of beauty have in common is that they consist in\nform or images of the Forms eternally present in Intellect (I 6. 2).\nThe lowest type of beauty is physical beauty where the splendor of the\nparadigm is of necessity most occluded.  If the beauty of a body is\ninseparable from that body, then it is only a remote image of the\nnon-bodily Forms.  Still, our ability to experience such beauty serves\nas another indication of our own intellects’ undescended character. We\nrespond to physical beauty because we dimly recognize its paradigm.\nTo call this paradigm ‘the Form of Beauty’ would be\nsomewhat misleading unless it were understood to include all the Forms\ncognized by Intellect.  Following Plato in Symposium, Plotinus\ntraces a hierarchy of beautiful objects above the physical,\nculminating in the Forms themselves.  And their source, the Good, is\nalso the source of their beauty (I 6. 7).  The beauty of the Good\nconsists in the virtual unity of all the Forms.  As it is the ultimate\ncause of the complexity of intelligible reality, it is the cause of\nthe delight we experience in form (see V 5. 12). \nPlotinus regarded himself as a loyal Platonist, an accurate exegete of\nthe Platonic revelation. By the middle of the 3rd century CE, the\nphilosophical world was populated with a diverse array of\nanti-Platonists. In the Enneads, we find Plotinus engaged\nwith many of these opponents of Platonism. In his creative response to\nthese we find many of his original ideas. \nAlthough Plotinus was glad to mine Aristotle’s works for distinctions\nand arguments that he viewed as helpful for explicating the Platonic\nposition, there were a number of issues on which Plotinus thought that\nAristotle was simply and importantly mistaken. Perhaps the major issue\nconcerned the nature of a first principle of all. Plotinus recognized\nthat Aristotle agreed with Plato that (1) there must be a first\nprinciple of all; (2) that it must be unique; and (3) that it must be\nabsolutely simple. But Aristotle erred in identifying that first\nprinciple with the Unmoved Mover, fully actual self-reflexive\nintellection. Plotinus did not disagree that there must be an eternal\nprinciple like the Unmoved Mover; this is what the hypostasis\nIntellect is. But he denied that the first principle of all could be\nan intellect or intellection of any sort, since intellection requires\na real distinction between the thinking and the object of thinking,\neven if that object is the thinker itself. A real distinction indicates some sort of complexity or compositeness in the thing (a real minor distinction) or among things (a real major distinction); by contrast, in a conceptual distinction, one thing is considered from different perspectives or aspects. In the absolutely simple first principle of all, there can be no distinct elements or parts at all. In fact, the first\nprinciple of all, the Good or the One, must be beyond thinking if it\nis to be absolutely simple. The misguided consequence of holding this\nview, according to Plotinus, is that Aristotle then misconceives being\nsuch that he identifies it with substance or ousia. But for the first\nprinciple of all actually to be such a principle, it must be unlimited\nin the way that ousia is not. As a result, Aristotle makes many\nmistakes, especially in metaphysics or ontology. \nThe second group of major opponents of Platonism were the Stoics. The\nEnneads are filled with anti-Stoic polemics. These polemics\nfocus principally on Stoic materialism, which Plotinus finds to be\nincapable of articulating an ontology which includes everything in the\nuniverse. More important, Stoic materialism is unable to provide\nexplanatory adequacy even in the realm in which the Stoics felt most\nconfident, namely, the physical universe. For example, the Stoics,\nowing to their materialism, could not explain consciousness or\nintentionality, neither of which are plausibly accounted for in\nmaterialistic terms. According to Plotinus, the Stoics were also\nunable to give a justification for their ethical position – not\nin itself too far distant from Plato’s – since their\nexhortations to the rational life could not coherently explain how one\nbody (the empirical self) was supposed to identify with another body\n(the ideal rational agent).  With regard to Plotinus’ contemporaries, he was sufficiently\nexercised by the self-proclaimed Gnostics to write a separate\ntreatise, II 9, attacking their views. These Gnostics, mostly heretic\nChristians, whose voluminous and obscure writings, were only partially\nunearthed at Nag Hammadi in 1945 and translated in the last two\ndecades, were sufficiently close to Platonism, but, in Plotinus’\nview, so profoundly perverse in their interpretation of it, that they\nmerited special attention. The central mistake of Gnosticism,\naccording to Plotinus, is in thinking that Soul is\n‘fallen’ and is the source of cosmic evil. As we have\nseen, Plotinus, although he believes that matter is evil, vociferously\ndenies that the physical world is evil. It is only the matter that\nunderlies the images of the eternal world that is isolated from all\nintelligible reality. The Gnostics ignore the structure of Platonic\nmetaphysics and, as a result, wrongly despise this world. For\nPlotinus, a hallmark of ignorance of metaphysics is arrogance, the\narrogance of believing that the elite or chosen possess special\nknowledge of the world and of human destiny. The idea of a secret\nelect, alone destined for salvation – which was what the\nGnostics declared themselves to be – was deeply at odds with\nPlotinus’ rational universalism. \n Porphyry’s edition of Plotinus’ Enneads preserved for\nposterity the works of the leading Platonic interpreter of antiquity.\nThrough these works as well as through the writings of Porphyry\nhimself (234 – c. 305 C.E.) and Iamblichus (c. 245–325\nC.E.), Plotinus shaped the entire subsequent history of philosophy.\nUntil well into the 19th century, Platonism was in large\npart understood, appropriated or rejected based on its Plotinian\nexpression and in adumbrations of this. \n The theological traditions of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism all,\nin their formative periods, looked to ancient Greek philosophy for the\nlanguage and arguments with which to articulate their religious\nvisions.  For all of these, Platonism expressed the philosophy that\nseemed closest to their own theologies.  Plotinus was the principal\nsource for their understanding of Platonism. \n Through the Latin translation of Plotinus by Marsilio Ficino\npublished in 1492, Plotinus became available to the West. The first\nEnglish translation, by Thomas Taylor, appeared in the late\n18th century.  Plotinus was, once again, recognized as the\nmost authoritative interpreter of Platonism.  In the writings of the\nItalian Renaissance philosophers, the 15th and\n16th century humanists John Colet, Erasmus of Rotterdam,\nand Thomas More, the 17th century Cambridge Platonists, and\nGerman idealists, especially Hegel, Plotinus’ thought was the\n(sometimes unacknowledged) basis for opposition to the competing and\nincreasingly influential tradition of scientific philosophy.  This\ninfluence continued in the 20th century flowering of\nChristian imaginative literature in England, including the works of\nC.S. Lewis and Charles Williams.
