This view may be argued for in various\nways: by appeal to logical laws and metaphysical necessities; by\nappeal to the existence and nature of God; by appeal to causal\ndeterminism. When argued for in the first way, it is commonly called\n“Logical fatalism” (or, in some cases, “Metaphysical\nfatalism”); when argued for in the second way, it is commonly\ncalled “Theological fatalism”. When argued for in the\nthird way it is not now commonly referred to as “fatalism”\nat all, and such arguments will not be discussed here.\n\n\n\nThe interest in arguments for fatalism lies at least as much in the\nquestion of how the conclusion may be avoided as in the question of\nwhether it is true.\n\n\n\nThe classic argument for fatalism occurs in Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.),\nDe Interpretatione, chapter 9. He addresses the question of\nwhether in relation to all questions it is necessary that the\naffirmation or the negation is true or false. \n\nWhat he says could be presented as an argument along the following\nlines. \n\nSuppose that (i) p is true or p is false and (ii)\nnot-p is true or not-p is false. \n\nThen p is true or not-p is true. \n\nNow suppose that in 1900 one person says that a sea-battle will take\nplace on 1/1/2100, and another says that a sea-battle will not take\nplace on 1/1/2100. \n\nThen either what the first person says is true or what the second\nperson says is true. \n\nBut, in that case, either it is necessary in 1900 that a sea-battle\ntakes place on 1/1/2100, or it is necessary in 1900 that one does not\ntake place. \n\nBut the date of the predictions is irrelevant, and it is irrelevant\nwhether any prediction is actually made at all. \n\nSo it is necessary at all times that a sea-battle takes place on\n1/1/2100, or that a sea-battle does not take place on 1/1/2100. \n\nBut the argument can evidently be generalised. \n\nSo, everything that happens, happens of necessity. \n\nFirst of all we need to be clear about what is meant by “necessity”\nhere. What is at issue here is not logical necessity. It is rather\ninevitability. When the occurrence of a sea-battle on 1/1/2100 is said\nto be necessary at a certain date, what is meant is that at that date\nnothing can prevent a sea-battle from taking place on 1/1/2100. In\nparticular, no one has the power to prevent it. Now Aristotle accepts\nthat “What is, necessarily is, when it is; and what is not, necessarily\nis not, when it is not.” So, he accepts that, if a sea-battle is\nactually taking place on 1/1/2100, then on 1/1/2100 it is (in this\nsense) taking place of necessity. Nothing can then stop it happening,\nbecause it is happening. What this argument appears to establish,\nhowever, is that, if a sea-battle takes place on 1/1/2100, not only is\nit necessary then that a sea-battle takes place on 1/1/2100, but it was\nalways necessary. No one could ever have prevented it. And the same\napplies to everything that can happen. So, in particular, no one ever\nhas the power to do anything other that what they actually do. \n\nSo, is there anything wrong with the argument? \n\nWell certainly there is a move which seems to require some\nexplanation: the move from truth to necessity. Why should it follow\nfrom the fact that it was true in 1900 that a sea-battle would take\nplace on 1/1/2100, that it was necessary that it should? This looks,\nindeed, suspiciously like a fallacious move from “Of necessity, if it\nis true that a sea-battle takes place on 1/1/2100, a sea-battle takes\nplace on 1/1/2100” to “If it is true that a sea-battle takes place on\n1/1/2100, a sea-battle takes place of necessity on 1/1/2100”. But such\nsuspicions are probably ill-founded. It is more likely that the move\ninvokes a certain form of the correspondence theory of truth: if what\nsomeone says at a certain time is true, then the state of the world at\nthat time must be such as to make it true. But since what is,\nnecessarily is when it is, the state of the world will be necessary.\nSo, anything that is true is necessarily true. \n\nHowever, even if this crucial move does not rest on a simple\nfallacy, the idea that the truth of what someone says is determined by\nthe state of the world at the time is questionable. We shall return to\nthis point. \n\nFirst we should notice Aristotle’s solution. Aristotle is in no doubt\nthat not everything that happens, happens of necessity. He accepts\nindeed (19a23–5) that “What is, necessarily is, when it is; and what\nis not, necessarily is not, when it is not.” But he goes on to say,\n“But not everything that is, necessarily is; and not everything that\nis not, necessarily is not.” So what is his solution? Here it must be\nsaid that there is more than one view. (Aristotle,\nCategories and De Interpretatione, 137–42). On one\nview he rejects the move from truth to necessity. That may indeed be\nthe right move to make, but in what follows I shall take it that\nAristotle actually offers a different solution, which, rightly or\nwrongly, I shall refer to as “the Aristotelian solution”. On this\nview his solution is to deny that it is necessary that the\naffirmation or the negation is true or false when this relates to\nthings that do not happen of necessity. That is to say, his solution\nis that neither what the first person said in 1900 (“There will be a\nsea-battle on 1/1/2100.”) nor what the second person said (“There\nwill not be a sea-battle on 1/1/2100.”) was true. What each person\nsaid was in fact neither true nor false. So we may represent the\nAristotelian solution as one which rejects the law of bivalence: \n\nIt is to be rejected in particular in relation to such propositions\nas, “there will be a sea-battle on 1/1/2100”; that is, in relation to\npropositions about future contingents, about what is neither necessary\nnor impossible. (For the view that Aristotle does not reject the law\nof bivalence see Whitaker 1996.) \n\nThough Aristotle does not explicitly say so, it seems that he would\nalso accept that if a sea-battle takes place on 1/1/2100, then what the\nfirst person said would then be true, and if it does not, what the\nsecond person said would then be true. So we may represent the\nAristotelian solution as holding the following: \n\nAre there any objections to this solution? \n\nOne objection is that the solution appears to require the rejection\nof the law of the excluded middle in addition to the law of bivalence.\nNow it is true that it involves the rejection of one form of the\nlaw: \n\nBut another form of the law is: \n\nDoes it involve the rejection of this? One might think it does, on the\ngrounds that “p” is equivalent to\n“p is true”. So LEM1 and LEM2 stand or fall\ntogether. Or one might think like this: “p\nor q” can be true only if either p is true\nor q is true (or both are). But, where p is a\nproposition about a future contingent it is not true, whether the\ncontingent state of affairs comes about or not; neither is its\nnegation true; so the disjunction, “p or\nnot-p” is not true. \n\nAs a matter of fact, though, this is not what Aristotle seems to\nhave thought. He says (19a28–32): \n\nSo, on the assumption that he would have accepted that “there will or\nwill not be a sea-battle tomorrow” is equivalent to “there will be a\nsea-battle tomorrow or there will not be a sea-battle tomorrow”, he\nwould, it seems, have accepted LEM2. How could this be? Well, what\nstops its being true that there will be a sea-battle tomorrow is that\nthere is nothing yet to determine that it is true. But there is\nsomething to determine that there will be or will not be a sea-battle\ntomorrow; in the nature of things one or the other must occur. So it\nis now true that there will be a sea-battle tomorrow or there will\nnot be a sea-battle tomorrow. \n\nThis suggests adopting the following rule for determining the\ntruth-value of complex propositions some of whose constituents are\nneither true nor false. One considers in turn each of the possible ways\nin which things may turn out, and works out what truth-value the\ncomplex proposition would then have. If it turns out to be true in\nevery case, it is true; if it turns out to be false in every case, it\nis false; otherwise it is neither true nor false. (van Fraassen\n1966) \n\nOf course this is not a wholly cost free line to take. Apart from the\nfact that it means that “p” and “p\nis true” are not in general interchangeable, it also creates\nproblems for truth-functionality. We normally think of\n“or”, “and” and “not” as being\ntruth-functional. That is to say, we think that the truth-values of\n“p or q”, “p\nand q” and “not-p” are determined\nby the truth-values of “p” and\n“q”. But if we adopt the Aristotelian solution,\nand accept the way outlined just now of determining the truth-value of\na complex proposition, “or”, for instance, will not be\ntruth functional. In some case “p or q”\nwill be true when neither p nor q is true (when, for\ninstance, “q” is “not-p”),\nand in some case it will not be (if, say, “p” is\n“there will be a sea-battle tomorrow” and\n“q” is “there will be a football match\ntomorrow”). (If one thinks in terms of there being a third\ntruth-value, indeterminacy, say, in addition to truth and falsity, the\nposition will be that, when p and\nq are both indeterminate, sometimes “p or q”\nis true, and sometimes it is indeterminate.). Similarly “p and\nq” will be false in the one case and indeterminate in the\nother. \n\nHowever, this objection might not seem very pressing compared with the\nthreat of fatalism. If accepting a lack of equivalence between\n“p” and “p is true” and a\nfailure of truth-functionality for “or” and\n“and” were the only alternative to accepting fatalism,\nmost people would find it easier to accept these theoretical oddities,\nif oddities they are. \n\nBut there is another objection to the Aristotelian solution which\nmakes it harder to accept — the way we treat bare predictions. If\nsomeone had said in 1972, “Red Rum will win the Grand National next\nyear”, surely, we would think, he was right. Not right in 1973, but\nright in 1972. That is to say, surely what he said was true, when he\nsaid it; not just later. Of course, we would not have known in 1972\nthat what he said was true; nor, presumably did he. Nor, of course\nwould we have supposed that there was anything inevitable about the\nvictory; these things, we naturally suppose, are a matter of chance.\nBut, of course, this objection to the Aristotelian solution is also an\nobjection to the argument for fatalism which was based on the\nassumption of bivalence. We are, effectively, rejecting the idea that\nif what someone says at a time is true at that time, then the state of\nthe world at the time must determine that it is true. What we seem to\nbe quite prepared to accept instead is the idea that for what is said\nto be true at a time it is sufficient if the state of the world\nwill sometime be such as to determine that it is true. \n\nThere is another problem about the theory of truth which the\nAristotelian argument seems to be invoking. If the theory really is\nthat the truth of what is said depends on the state of the world at the\ntime of the saying, does not that raise a problem for statements about\nthe past? Suppose someone says that a dinosaur stood on this spot\nmillions of years ago. For this to be true, must the present state of\nthe world be such as to determine that it is? Some people have indeed\nthought this; and they have thought that, just as some propositions\nthat were not true come to be true, so also some that were true cease\nto be true. (Łukasiewicz 1967) But this is even further from what we\nare naturally inclined to say. A more attractive alternative, if we\nwished to retain something like this theory of truth, would be to say\nthat what happened in the past counts as part of the present state of\nthe world, because the past, like the present, is necessary. But it is\nnot clear why that should be enough to make it part of the present\nstate of the world. Perhaps it would be better to take the view simply\nthat something is true at a time only if it is necessary at that time.\nBut then we would need some argument for this position which went\nbeyond the simple thought that what is said is made true by the way the\nworld is at the time it is said. \n\nIt is worth noticing some other solutions which are closely related\nto the Aristotelian solution, but avoid some of the problems. \n\n1. (Prior 1967). One could agree with Aristotle that “there will\nbe a sea-battle tomorrow” is not true, even if it turns out that\nthere is a sea battle; but instead of saying that it is neither true\nnor false, one could say that it is false. What is more, one could say\nthat the negation, “there will not be a sea-battle\ntomorrow” is true. Then we could retain the law of bivalence,\nand the equivalence between “p” and\n“p is true”. Effectively we would be treating\n“p” as equivalent to “it is necessary\nthat p”. And we would, no doubt, distinguish between\n“there will not be a sea-battle tomorrow”, where this is\nthe negation of “there will be a sea-battle tomorrow” and\n“there will be no sea-battle tomorrow” which, like\n“there will be a sea-battle tomorrow”, is false. One might\neven say that “there will not be a sea-battle tomorrow” is\nambiguous; it could be equivalent to “it is not necessary that\nthere will be sea-battle tomorrow” or it could be equivalent to\n“it is necessary that there will be no sea-battle\ntomorrow”. Certainly it is in favour of this view that one would\nretain the law of bivalence and also the truth-functionality of\n“or” and “and”. But there would be a heavy\nprice to pay. Now we should have to say what the person said about Red\nRum was false. \n\n2. (Lucas 1986) One could make use of Reichenbach’s distinction\nbetween the time of the utterance of a proposition, the time of the\nreference point and the time of the event. (Reichenbach 1947) One\ncould then say that the truth of what is said depends not on the state\nof the world at the time of the utterance, but on the state of the\nworld at the time of the reference point. One may then say that the\nreference point of the utterance in 1972 of “Red Rum will win\nthe Grand National next year” is 1973, not 1972. So, it was\ntrue. (Whereas, if someone had said “Red Rum is going to win the\nGrand National next year”, the use of “is going to”\nrather than “will” might perhaps have meant that the\nreference point was the time of the utterance, rather than the time of\nnext year’s Grand National. So what was said would not have been\ntrue.) \n\n3. (Tooley 1997) One could distinguish between truth at a time,\nwhich depends on the state of the world at the time, and truth\nsimpliciter, which does not. One could then allow that the\nprediction about Red Rum was true, as long as we are talking about\ntruth simpliciter. Also, where truth simpliciter was\nat issue, we could retain the law of bivalence and the equivalence\nbetween “p” and “p is\ntrue”. \n\nBut finally we should not forget that, even if we wish to retain a\ncorrespondence theory of truth, we can reject the idea that truth\ndepends on the state of the world at the time of the utterance of a\nproposition or even the state of the world at the time of the\nreference point. We can say that it depends on the state of the world\nat the time of the event spoken of; or, more generally, that it\ndepends on the state of the world at the times spoken of, if any\n(Westphal 2006). The solution we prefer is, however, likely to be\nrelated to the view we take about the nature of time. \n\nOn a B-theory of time an event’s being past, present or future is\nsimply a relational matter; it is simply a matter of its occurring at\na time which is earlier than, or simultaneous with, or later than some\ntime which is taken as the reference point – the time at which I\nam having this thought, say. On an A-theory, on the other hand, that\nthis time (or this event) is now is an absolute (if temporary) fact\nabout it. But, in addition, a B-theory will typically hold that all\ntimes are equally real, whereas, typically, an A-theory will\nhold either that only the present and the past are real (type 1), or\nthat only the present is real (type 2). So, on a B-theory, there can\nbe future facts to make propositions about the future true; but, on an\nA-theory of type 1, a proposition about the future can be made true\nonly by present and past facts together with timeless facts; and, on\nan A-theory of type 2, propositions both about the future and about\nthe past, can be made true only by present facts together with\ntimeless facts. And, evidently, on either type of A-theory a\nproposition may be true at one time, but not true at another,\ndepending on what facts exist at the time.  (For a fuller \ndescription of the A-theory and B-theory, see the Section \n5 of the entry on \n time.)\n\n \n\nAristotle’s problem seemed to have arisen as a result of a theory of\ntruth according to which, if a statement is true at a time, there has\nto be a state of the world at that time which makes it true. However,\nit has been argued that, if every meaningful statement is either true\nor false (once and for all), that alone implies fatalism; the very\nfact that a statement is true is enough to make what it describes\nunavoidable (Taylor 1983, Chapter 6). Suppose, for example, that John\nshaved one morning. Then the statement, “John shaved that morning”, is\ntrue. But, it is argued, that means that John did not have the power\nnot to shave; because to have that power would be to have the power to\nrender a true statement false. But no one has such a power; no one has\never succeeded in making a true statement false. \nNow the final claim is certainly true, on the assumption that\nmeaningful statements have just one truth-value. No one has ever\nbrought about a situation in which a statement which was true is\nfalse; that is, a situation in which (a) there is a statement which\nwas true and (b) that statement is now false. However, to have the\npower to render a true statement false, one does need to have the\npower to bring about such a situation. It is enough that (a) there\nshould be a statement which is true, and that one has the power merely\nto bring about a situation in which (b) that statement is (and always\nwas) false instead. So for John to have had the power to\nrender false the true statement, “John shaved that morning”, it is\nenough that he should have had the power not to shave instead of\nshaving. Of course, he did not exercise that power; but, in the\nabsence of some other argument to the contrary, presumably he could\nhave done; in which case he would have made the statement, “John\nshaved that morning” false instead of true. So, it seems that there is\nno simple move from truth to fatalism. \n\nDiodorus Cronus (late 4th – early 3rd centuries B.C.E.) had an argument\nfor fatalism, known as “The Master Argument”. Its conclusion was,\n“the possible is that which either is or will be”. We know the\npremisses but, unfortunately we do not know the intermediate\nsteps. The premisses were (1) “Everything that is past and true is\nnecessary”, (2) “The impossible does not follow from the\npossible”. (Kneale and Kneale 1962, 119) \n\nI shall not try to reconstruct the way the argument actually went,\nbut consider an argument to it which might have been akin, which\nargues for fatalism on the basis of the necessity of the past. The\nargument goes: \n\nWhat is true of the past is necessary. \n\nSuppose that there is a sea-battle on 1/1/2100. \n\nThen it was true in 1900 that there would be a sea-battle on\n1/1/2100. \n\nThen it was true of the past that there would be a sea-battle on\n1/1/2100. \n\nSo it is necessary that there will be a sea-battle on 1/1/2100. \n\nTherefore, if there is a sea-battle on 1/1/2100, it is necessary\nthat there will be a sea-battle on 1/1/2100 (and impossible that there\nshould not be). \n\nIs anything wrong with this argument? \n\nWe could certainly make an Aristotelian objection to the argument.\nWe could deny that if a sea-battle takes place on 1/1/2100, it was true\nin 1900 that a sea-battle would take place. \n\nWe could also question either the first premiss or the application\nof it. \n\nIs what is true of the past necessary? Well certainly pretty well\neveryone thinks that what happened in the past cannot be undone. The\npast cannot now be altered. For if one were to undo the past, that\nwould mean that something which did happen did not happen; or, at the\nvery least, that it was true that something happened and then later was\nnot true that it happened. Most people (but not such a large majority)\nalso think that something else is impossible, namely affecting what\nhappened in the past or causing something to have happened in the past.\n(This is not the same thing, of course, as altering the past. If one\ncaused something to have happened, one would not thereby bring it about\nthat something that did not happen did happen.) But it is one thing to\nthink that one cannot make it true that there was a sea-battle\nyesterday, and quite another thing to think that one cannot make it\ntrue yesterday that there will be a sea-battle tomorrow. \n\nThis might be called the Ockhamist solution to the problem. What\nOckham (c1285–1347) says is: \n\nIn the spirit of this we may say that some propositions about the\npast are really (at any rate in part) about the future. And in these\ncases they are not necessary. And we may then apply this to “it was\ntrue in 1900 that there would be a sea-battle on 1/1/2100.” This, we\nmay say, is (in part) really about 1/1/2100. \n\nPropositions which are in this way verbally about one time,\nt, but are really (in part) about a later time, are often said\nto express “soft facts” about t. Unfortunately it is not at\nall clear quite how the notion of a soft fact should be made precise.\nOne might, for instance, say that if a proposition about t\nlogically entails a proposition about a later time, it expresses a soft\nfact about t. But if that is the correct account, it seems\nthat many propositions expressing soft facts about the past will be\nnecessary, even when they are partly about the future. For instance, a\nproposition which conjoins some plausibly necessary proposition about\nthe past with a law of nature to the effect that in these circumstances\nsomething in the future will ensue would seem to entail something\nabout the future; but since it is a conjunction of two plausibly\nnecessary propositions, it seems to be necessary itself. \n\nHowever it seems there is one variety of proposition which\npresumably expresses a soft fact about the past, but is very plausibly\nnot necessary, namely a proposition which is equivalent to a\nconjunction where one of the conjuncts is plausibly wholly about the\nfuture, and where the other conjunct does not entail it. And, if the\nAristotelian solution is wrong, our example seems to fit this bill. The\nproposition, “it was true in 1900 that there would be a sea-battle on\n1/1/2100” is plausibly equivalent to “there was such a time as 1900 and\nthere will be a sea-battle on 1/1/2100.” And this proposition will not\nbe necessary, if it is not necessary that there will be a sea-battle on\n1/1/2100. \n\nNotice that this does not show that the fatalist is wrong. It could\nstill be that the proposition that there will be a sea-battle on\n1/1/2100 is necessary. But it does seem to show that this\nargument does not show that fatalism is correct. The position seems to\nbe that, either the argument does not work, because the Aristotelian\nsolution is correct, or the argument does not work because, in the\nabsence of an independent reason to suppose that the proposition that\nthere will be a sea-battle on 1/1/2100 is necessary, we have no reason\nto suppose that the proposition, “it was true in 1900 that there would\nbe a sea-battle on 1/1/2100” is a necessary proposition. \n\nRichard Taylor argues that certain commonly accepted presuppositions\nyield a proof of fatalism. (Taylor 1962) The presuppositions are: \n\n1. Any proposition whatever is either true, or if not true,\nfalse. \n\n2. If any state of affairs is sufficient for, though logically\nunrelated to, the occurrence of some further condition at the same time\nor any other time, then the former cannot occur without the latter\noccurring also. \n\n3. If the occurrence of any condition is necessary for, though\nlogically unrelated to, the occurrence of some other condition at the\nsame time, or any other time, then the latter cannot occur without the\nformer occurring also. \n\n4. If one condition or set of conditions is sufficient for (ensures)\nanother, then the other is necessary (essential) for it, and\nconversely, if one condition or set of conditions is necessary\n(essential) for another, then that other is sufficient for (ensures)\nit. \n\n5. No agent can perform any given act if there is lacking, at the\nsame time or any other time, some condition necessary for the\noccurrence of that act. \n\n6. Time is not by itself “efficacious”; that is, the mere passage of\ntime does not augment or diminish the capacities of anything and, in\nparticular, it does not enhance or decrease an agent’s powers or\nabilities. \n\nHe then produces an argument to show (what most of us believe) that\neither it is not in my power to read a headline saying that there was\na sea-battle yesterday or it is not in my power to read a headline\nsaying that there was no sea-battle yesterday, at any rate if we make\nsome obvious assumptions about the relation between the headlines and\nwhat took place. Letting S be the act of reading a headline\nthat there was a sea-battle, and S′ be the act of\nreading a headline that there was no sea-battle; and letting\nP and P′ be the propositions that there was\nand was not such a battle, the argument goes: \n But if P′ is true, then it is not in my power to do\nS (for a similar reason). \n But either P is true or P′ is true \n\n So, either it is not in my power to do S or it is not in my power to\ndo S′. \n\nThe argument, he claims is sound, given the six presuppositions. \n\nBut suppose, his argument continues, we let O and\nO′ be the act of ordering a sea-battle and the act of\nordering no sea-battle, and Q and Q′ be the\npropositions that there will and will not be such a battle; and we\nsubstitute O and O′ for S and\nS′, and Q and Q′ for P\nand P′, and “tomorrow” for\n“yesterday” in the argument above, then (if we make some\nobvious assumptions about the relation between what we order and what\nhappens) we have a parallel argument which goes:\n\n \n But if Q′ is true, then it is not in my power to do\nO (for a similar reason). \n But either Q is true or Q′ is true \n So, either it is not in my power to do O or it is not in my power to\ndo O′. \n \nAnd this argument seems equally sound. And evidently it can be\ngeneralised to yield the fatalist conclusion that it is never in our\npower to do anything other than what we actually do. \n\nAre there any objections to his argument? \n\nWell, one might certainly object to presupposition 6, on the grounds\nthat it does indeed seem to be the passage of time which makes a\ndifference to my power to bring about or prevent a sea-battle on a\ncertain day. Till the day is over, I may have the power, but after the\nday, I have not. However, presupposition 6 does not in fact seem to\nplay a significant role in the parallel arguments. So that cannot be\nthe whole story. \n\nThe objection that Taylor himself suggests is the Aristotelian one:\nwe reject presupposition 1 (and also, presupposition 6, since we\nembrace the idea that a proposition may fail to be either true or false\nat one time and come to be true or false later, as a result of the mere\npassage of time). We would also, presumably, need to amend\npresupposition 5, so that it was not the lack of a necessary condition\nfor an act which was problematical, but the existence of a condition\nwhich was sufficient for the non-performance of the act. \n\nIs that the only objection? Must we accept the Aristotelian solution\nif we wish to escape the fatalistic conclusion? \n\nIt seems that there is an alternative to the Aristotelian solution,\nbecause Taylor’s presupposition 5 seems dubious. A symptom of this is\nthat it seems to yield the fatalist conclusion a bit too easily. For\nsupposing that I do not perform act S (whatever it is), then\nit follows immediately that there is lacking a necessary condition for\nmy performing S, namely the occurrence of S. So, if\npresupposition 5 is right, it follows immediately that I never have\nthe power to perform any act which I do not actually perform. Of\ncourse, that does not show that this conclusion is wrong; but it\nenough to make one question the presupposition which entails it. And\none might suggest that not only is this presupposition false, but that\nit seems true because it is easily confused with another much more\nplausible proposition (equivalent to Hasker’s PEP5; see Hasker 1989,\n115): \n\nAnd if we substitute that for Taylor’s presupposition 5, the\nparallel argument is no longer sound. \n\nIt is possible, it seems, to reply to the arguments for fatalism which\nwe have considered so far, without appealing to the Aristotelian\nsolution. We can reject the theory of truth which is crucial to\nAristotle’s argument; we can reject the idea that all statements which\nare about the past are necessary; we can reject Taylor’s account of\nthe conditions of power. And we can do this without questioning the\nidea that we cannot affect the past, except, at any rate, in the\nrather ill-defined collection of cases to which Ockham draws our\nattention.  However, it is open to the fatalist to argue that we have\nno good reason for making the distinction we do between affecting the\npast and affecting the future. So, if we accept that we cannot affect\nthe past, we ought also to accept that we cannot affect the future. Of\ncourse, this cuts both ways. We might equally come to the conclusion,\nin the absence of a good reason for making the distinction, that since\nwe can affect the future we can also affect the past; or, if that\nseems outrageous, we could affect the past if natural laws did not\nprevent our doing so. \n\nThis objection by the fatalist is surely right about one thing.\nIf we cannot affect the past, it would be good to know\nwhy we cannot.  One possible answer would be that which an\nA-theorist of time might give, namely that there is a fundamental\nontological difference between the future on the one hand and the\npresent and past on the other, which consists in the fact that the\npresent and past are real or actual, while the future is not. And it\nis this fact, that the future is not real or actual, which means that\nit is open, can be affected by what happens now; and it is the fact\nthat the present and past are real or actual which means that they\ncannot be affected by what happens now.  (Lucas 1989a, Tooley\n1997). \n\nSuch accounts, as we have noted above, seem to support the\nAristotelian solution. But they are not the only accounts. On some\naccounts there is no such fundamental ontological difference between\nthe future and the present and past; the impossibility of affecting\nthe past lies not in the fact that the passage of time puts a\nconstraint on what can be caused, but rather in the fact that it is\nthe direction of causation which determines the direction of\ntime. (Swinburne 1994, Mellor 1981 and 1998) On yet other accounts the\nimpossibility is simply a fundamental metaphysical fact which is not\nopen to further analysis or explanation. \n\nIt is, of course, possible that the fatalist challenge about the\ndifference between the future and the present and past cannot be\nsuccessfully met. For instance, it could be argued (a) that the only\nsuccessful answer would be one which appealed to a fundamental\nontological distinction between the future and the present and past,\nbut that (b) there is in fact no such distinction. (Shanks 1994;\ndiscussed in Oaklander 1998) But, as we have noted, even if this\nchallenge cannot be met, it does not show that the fatalist is\ncorrect. The possibility remains that we can, in principle, affect the\npast. \n\nA problem which has been much discussed by philosophers, at least\nsince the time of Augustine (354–430), is whether divine omniscience is\ncompatible with free will, and in particular with our having the power\nto do other than we do. \n\nOne way of arguing for this incompatibility is due to Pike. (Pike\n1965) \n\nLet us suppose that being omniscient involves being infallible, and\nbelieving that p if and only if it is true that\np. \n\nLet us also suppose that God existed in 1900, and that omniscience\nis part of his essence. \n\nNow, suppose that Jones mowed his lawn on 1/1/2000. \n\nThen God believed in 1900 that Jones would mow his lawn on\n1/1/2000. \n\nDid Jones have the power to refrain from mowing his lawn? \n\nNo. Because that would mean either (1) that he had the power to do\nsomething which would have brought it about that God had a false belief\nin 1900, or (2) that he had the power to do something which would have\nbrought it about that God did not believe in 1900 that Jones would mow\nhis lawn on 1/1/2000, or (3) that he had the power to do something\nwhich would have brought it about that God did not exist in 1900. And\neach of these alternatives is impossible. \n\nAre there any objections to this argument? \n\nNaturally it would be possible to object to some of the suppositions\nabout the existence and nature of God. I will return to them. \n\nFirst we should notice that the argument depends on a certain\nprinciple about power which is very similar to the plausible amended\nversion of Taylor’s presupposition 5: \n\nThis seems plausible. One might, though, prefer to avoid all mention\nof bringing about, and to rephrase the argument in\nterms of counterfactuals. So, one would say instead, “…that would\nmean either (1) that he had the power so to act that God would have had\na false belief in 1900, or …” (Fischer 1989, 8–11) However, the\nargument seems at least as plausible when rephrased in this way. \n\nOne might object to the conclusion that God believed in 1900 that Jones\nwould mow his lawn on 1/1/2000, on the grounds that propositions about\nfuture contingents are not true. So if God is omniscient in the way\nassumed, he would not hold this belief. \n\nOckham’s answer to the problem of divine foreknowledge was to invoke\nthe difference between propositions which are really about the past\n(those that express “hard” facts about the past) and those\nwhich are verbally about the past but which are really in part about\nthe future (those that express “soft” facts about the\npast). The crucial point was that, even if someone lacked the power to\ndo something inconsistent with a hard fact about the past, one might\nhave the power to do something inconsistent with a soft fact about the\npast. To make such a solution work in the case of the problem posed by\nPike’s argument, it would be necessary to show, or at any rate to make\nit plausible, that one of the alternatives mentioned above was in fact\nopen to Jones, because what he would be bringing about would be\ninconsistent with a soft fact about the past, not a hard fact. The\ndifficulty for this strategy, though, is to give an account of soft\nfacts about the past, or at least a species of soft facts about the\npast, which meets two conditions: (1) it makes it true that in one of\nthe cases what Jones would be bringing about would be inconsistent\nwith a soft fact of the right sort, and also (2) it is such that it is\nplausible (at any rate in advance of any fatalist proofs to the\ncontrary) that in the case of soft facts of that sort it is in\nprinciple possible at a later date to bring things about which are\ninconsistent with them. (The Introduction to Fischer 1989, and many of\nthe articles in it are relevant to these issues.) \n\nIt is easy enough to give an account of soft facts which fails,\napparently, to meet the second condition. For instance we might say that a\nproposition expresses a soft fact about a time if it entails a\nproposition about another time. By that criterion “God infallibly\nbelieves in 1900 that Jones will mow the lawn on 1/1/2100” expresses a\nsoft fact, because it entails that Jones will mow the lawn on 1/1/2100.\nBut we can hardly go on to say that for that reason there is no problem\nabout Jones’s having the power to refrain from mowing the lawn, since\nrefraining is inconsistent with a merely soft fact. To say that the\nproposition about God entails that Jones will mow the lawn is to state\nthe problem. It can hardly in itself constitute the solution. If it did\nwe could solve the argument for fatalism which is based on causal\ndeterminism simply by pointing out that, if determinism is true, the\nfact that Jones will mow the lawn is entailed by a proposition about\ninitial conditions and laws of nature, so that the latter is merely a\nsoft fact. \n\nIt is also, as we have seen in connexion with logical fatalism, easy\nenough to delineate a species of soft facts about the past which do\nmeet the second condition. An example would be a proposition which is\nequivalent to one conjoining “Jones will mow the lawn on 1/1/2000”\nwith any proposition about the past\nwhich does not entail it. But it is difficult to see how this\nspecies of soft facts could fulfil the first condition. \n\nOf course, the prospects of providing a solution would be satisfying \nif it could be made plausible that in some cases it is\nin people’s powers to do things which are inconsistent with\nhard facts about the past, not just soft facts. But to take\nthat approach is, in effect, to abandon the idea of an Ockhamist\nsolution, and to move on to the next solution. \n\nOne possible solution is to suggest that Pike’s second alternative is\npossible, without any appeal to softness of facts. According to this\nsolution, in some cases people have the power do things which are\ninconsistent with the actual facts about the past, even though they are\nhard facts. That is to say, in some cases people have the power to\naffect the past. In particular the suggestion is that Jones had the\npower to do something which would have brought it about that God did\nnot believe in 1900 that he would mow the lawn. (Anglin 1986) The\nplausibility of such a solution will depend largely on the strength of\nthe arguments for the impossibility of affecting the past. \n\nNow some such arguments seek merely to demonstrate this\nimpossibility without offering any further explanation for it. And it\nmay be contended that most of the arguments of this sort which are at\nall compelling involve appealing to the obvious impossibility that an\nevent might prevent its own occurrence, and to the slightly less\nobvious impossibility that an event might bring about its own\noccurrence. But, in reply to such arguments, it may be claimed that\nthese impossibilities are not sufficient to rule out the possibility\nthat one event might bring about an earlier event, as long as the world\nis so organised as to avoid these impossible outcomes. If so, it is not\nclear why God should not have so organised it. And in particular it is\nnot clear why God should not have so organised things that it is\npossible for us to do things which affect what beliefs he holds. \n\nHowever, as we have seen, other arguments for the impossibility of\naffecting the past go further, and incorporate an explanation for the\nimpossibility. A successful defence against theological fatalism which\nappealed to the possibility of affecting the past would have to deal\nwith these further issues. \n\nBoethius (c480–524) offered a solution to the problem which in effect\ndenied the supposition that God existed in 1900 or believed anything\nin 1900.  (Boethius, The Consolation of Philosophy, Book V)\nGod is, on this view, outside time; he is timelessly eternal. Thomas\nAquinas (1225–74) also offered this solution. (Aquinas, Summa\nTheologica, Article 13) The idea behind the solution is, of\ncourse, that if God’s knowledge is not temporal there is no reason\nwhy Jones should not have the power to bring it about that God knows\nthat he refrains from mowing the lawn on 1/1/2000 instead of knowing\nthat he mows the lawn then, since possessing that power would not\nrequire having the power to affect the past. \n\nThere may be a number of problems about whether a personal God could\nbe timeless, and how, if at all, he could relate to a temporal world,\nbut it is worth noting one particular problem. The problem is that,\nalthough this solution does not appeal to the possibility of affecting\nthe past, it may be vulnerable to some of the considerations which\nwould tell against that possibility. For suppose that we are unable to\naffect the past, and that the explanation for this inability is that,\nwhereas the future is not real, not actual, the past and present are\nreal and actual. Then it would seem that we would not be able to affect\na timeless God’s beliefs because, not being future, they would be as\nreal as any past beliefs. (Adams 1987, 1135; Zagzebski 1991, 61) Or\nsuppose instead that the explanation for our inability to affect the\npast is that, if our action brings anything about, that in itself would\nconstitute our action’s being earlier than the thing brought about.\nThen it might seem that the idea that we could bring about a timeless\nbelief would have to be dismissed; the very fact that a belief was\nbrought about would make it later than whatever brought it about, and\nso not timeless. (Though there would be some logical space, perhaps,\nfor a view that, whereas it was true of temporal events that,\nif they were brought about, they must be later than what brought them\nabout, this was not true of events in general.) \n\nOf course, such considerations need not be fatal to the Boethian\nsolution, because the view that the future is unreal, and the view that\nthe temporal order is determined by the causal order are both\ncontroversial. What it does seem to mean, though, is that there is less\nroom than one might have supposed for the success of the solution if it\nis impossible to affect the past.(Rice 2006) \n\nIt is worth noticing a further potential awkwardness for the Boethian\nsolution. If it is really impossible to affect the past, then, even if\nthe Boethian solution would mean that God could know that Jones would\nmow the lawn on 1/1/2000 without compromising Jones’s power to\nrefrain, he could not, on the basis of this knowledge, bring about\nevents in the world before 1/1/2000, which he would not have brought\nabout if Jones had refrained; for if he did, this would mean that\nJones had the power so to act that things would have been different\nbefore 1/1/2000; that is, he would have had the power to affect the\npast. \n\nPike’s argument rests on the supposition that God’s omniscience involves\nhaving beliefs. But this may be questioned. (Alston 1986) Instead his\nknowledge, in particular of our actions, may be thought as Russellian\nacquaintance knowledge; that is, as consisting of a simple cognitive\nrelation between the knower and what is known. (Russell 1912, Chapter\n5) The idea would be that, although in humans acquaintance knowledge\ngives rise to beliefs, God has just the cognitive relation to what he\nknows, without any consequent beliefs. This seems to have been the way\nBoethius and Aquinas thought of it.  (Boethius, The Consolation of\nPhilosophy, Book V, Prose 6; Aquinas, Summa Theologica,\nArticle 13) \n\nHow would this view about God’s knowledge affect the question of\nwhether divine omniscience entails fatalism?  \n\nBoth Boethius and Aquinas thought of God as outside time, but this\nview about God’s knowledge could also be combined with the view that\nhe is inside time. In that case it seems that it would be be possible\nto adopt an Ockhamist account of how his knowledge in 1900 might be\ndependent on what Jones does on 1/1/2000. Certainly it looks as if\n“God was aware in 1900 of Jones’s mowing the lawn on 1/1/2000” is\npartly about 1/1/2000.  And, given that this awareness is supposed to\nbe a simple relation, there is no question of producing an analysis of\nthe proposition which represents it as a conjunction of propositions\neach of which seem to express facts which do not depend on anything\nJones can do. We should notice, however, the same awkwardness could\narise in connection with God’s use of his knowledge as arose\nfor the Boethian solution. If it is impossible to affect the\npast, then God could not make use of his knowledge that Jones would\nmow the lawn on 1/1/2000 to bring something about before that date, if\nJones had the power to refrain from mowing. \n\nThere is no reason, of course, why this account of the nature of God’s\nknowledge should not be combined with the view that the future is\nunreal. In that case God would not come to know of Jones’s mowing of\nthe lawn before 1/1/2000, because there would as yet be no fact for\nhim to be aware of. But this would not compromise his omniscience,\nsince, presumably, on this account of knowledge, omniscience would be\na matter of knowing all the facts. \n\nFor that matter, the account could also be combined with both the view\nthat God is outside time and the view that the future is unreal\n— as long as these two views themselves are indeed\ncompatible. In that case it would not be true before 1/1/2000 that God\ntimelessly knows the Jones mows the lawn, but would be true on\n1/1/2000 and thereafter. Of course, a timeless being cannot change,\nbut this would not involve a change in God, but merely a change in\nwhat he is related to. (The number 10 does not change when I refer to\nit.) \n\nOf course the threat of fatalism, when it arises from God’s existence,\ncould be averted by denying that God exists. But it could also be\naverted by denying that God needs to be thought of as omniscient\n— at any rate if omniscience involves infallible knowledge of\nall facts. It could be argued that God’s perfection does not require\nthe infallible knowledge of all facts, but at most such knowledge of\nall facts that could possibly be known infallibly. So, if it is\nlogically impossible for someone to have infallible knowledge that\nJones will mow the lawn and for Jones to have the power to refrain, it\nis no imperfection in God if he lacks such knowledge. (Swinburne 1977,\n172–8). It could also be argued that there is no need to attribute\ninfallible knowledge to God at all. (Lucas 1986 and 1989b) \n\nSome philosophers, notably Luis de Molina (1535–1600) and Alvin\nPlantinga, have held that God knows not only what actual people will\nfreely do in the future, but what each possible free creature would\nhave freely done in each set of possible circumstances, if fully\nspecific; and that he had this knowledge at the creation. (An action\nis free in the required sense if not causally determined and not\npredetermined by God.)  Propositions about what a creature would do in\na set of circumstances (possible as well as actual) are commonly\ncalled “counterfactuals of freedom”, and God’s knowledge\nof them is called “middle knowledge”. (Molina, On\nDivine Foreknowledge (Part IV of the Concordia); Plantinga 1974,\nIX)) \n\nIf God’s knowledge of actual future actions would constitute a\nfatalistic threat, his middle knowledge could not be less threatening,\nsince, given middle knowledge, he would have knowledge of actual\nactions on the basis of his knowledge of the circumstances. In fact it\nseems that it is more threatening. \n\nOf course, one way of avoiding the threat would be to deny that\nthere are in general any facts about what people would have freely done\nin circumstances that have not actually arisen; there may be facts\nabout what they might have done, or what they would very probably have\ndone; but not what they would have done. (Adams 1977; Hasker\n1989, 20–9) Indeed this seems to be quite plausible if we really think\nof people’s actions as undetermined. It may help us to see this if we\nconsider the tossing of a coin. Let us suppose that a coin is tossed on\nsome occasion, and it comes down heads; and suppose we then ask if it\nwould have come down heads again if we had tossed it again in exactly\nthe same circumstances. It seems plausible, if we think that how it\nlanded was undetermined, that the right answer is that it might have\ncome down heads and it might have come down tails, but that it is not\nthe case that it would have come down heads, nor the case that it would\nhave come down tails. \n\nSo one solution to the fatalistic threat posed by middle knowledge is\nakin to the Aristotelian solution. Since there are no facts of the\nrelevant sort, God cannot have knowledge of them. But, because there\nare no such facts, God’s lack of knowledge of how free creatures would\nfreely act is no bar to his omniscience. \n\nAre there any other solutions? \n\nIt is difficult to see how there could be. In the case of actual\nactions, the solutions depended on suggesting ways in which it might\nhave been possible for Jones to do something which would bring it about\nthat some fact about God was different; that is to say that they\ndepended on showing how some fact about God might be dependent on what\nJones did. Now in the case of middle knowledge we know how such a\ndependence would have to operate; it would have to operate by way of\nGod’s knowledge of counterfactuals of freedom. So, could the truth of\ncounterfactuals of freedom related to Jones be dependent on Jones’s\nactions? It seems that they could not be, because the facts that make\nthem true were available to God at the creation, before he had decided\nto create anything, let alone Jones. So the facts, like God’s decision,\nmust have been ontologically prior, it seems, to any act of Jones’s. So\nit seems that it could not be in Jones’s power so to act that any\nactually true counterfactual of freedom relating to him would not have\nbeen true. (Hasker 1989, 39–52; see Hasker et al. 2000 for a collection\nof writings on middle knowledge.) \n\nAristotle mentions, as a corollary of the conclusion that everything\nthat happens, happens of necessity, that “there would be no need to\ndeliberate or to take trouble (thinking that if we do this, this will\nhappen, but if we do not, it will not).” (Aristotle, De\nInterpretatione, 18b31–3) \n\nThis thought was spelt out in what was known as “the Idle\nArgument” (Bobzien 1998, Section 5). It went like this: \nIf it is fated that you will recover from this illness, then,\nregardless of whether you consult a doctor or you do not consult a\ndoctor you will recover. \n But also, if it is fated that you will not recover from this\nillness, then, regardless of whether you consult a doctor or you do not\nconsult a doctor you will not recover. \n But either it is fated that you will recover from this illness or it is fated that\nyou will not recover. \n Therefore it is futile to consult a doctor. \n\nThe thought, presumably, is that it is futile, because what you do\nwill have no effect. If so, the reply given by Chrysippus (c280-c206\nB.C.E.) to this argument seems exactly right. (Bobzien 1998, 5.2) The\nconclusion does not follow, because it may have been fated that you\nwill recover as a result of seeing the doctor. The corresponding reply\nwould be equally apt if we substituted “necessary” for\n“fated”. \n\nSome versions of the argument omit “it is fated that”. (Bobzien\n1998, 189). It goes without saying that the corresponding version of\nChrysippus’s reply would deal with those versions of the argument. \n\nThis is not to say that fatalism does not pose any problem at all\nfor the rationality of deliberation. It is just to say that the Idle\nArgument does not show that it poses a problem. \n\nThere are a number of arguments for fatalism, and it seems that one\nway of countering all of them would be to adopt the Aristotelian\nsolution, or something akin to it. It would be neat if it could be made\nout that this was the only solution, so that the fate of fatalism was\ninextricably linked to the fate of the Aristotelian solution. But it\ndoes not seem that this is so, except possibly, on the assumption that\nan omniscient God exists, in relation to middle knowledge. But even\nthen, the solution is only a poor relation to the Aristotelian\nsolution. \n\nSo it is possible that both fatalism and the Aristotelian solution\nare wrong. And it is, of course, always possible, for all that has been\nsaid, that fatalism is correct.","contact.mail":"hugh.rice@philosophy.ox.ac.uk","contact.domain":"philosophy.ox.ac.uk"}]
