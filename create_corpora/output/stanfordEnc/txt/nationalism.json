(2) raises questions about whether\nself-determination must be understood as involving having full\nstatehood with complete authority over domestic and international\naffairs, or whether something less is required.\n\n\nNationalism came into the focus of philosophical debate three decades\nago, in the nineties, partly in consequence of rather spectacular and\ntroubling nationalist clashes. Surges of nationalism tend to present a\nmorally ambiguous, and for this reason often fascinating, picture.\n“National awakening” and struggles for political\nindependence are often both heroic and cruel; the formation of a\nrecognizably national state often responds to deep popular sentiment\nbut sometimes yields inhuman consequences, from violent expulsion and\n“cleansing” of non-nationals to organized mass murder. The\nmoral debate on nationalism reflects a deep moral tension between\nsolidarity with oppressed national groups on the one hand and\nrepulsion in the face of crimes perpetrated in the name of nationalism\non the other. Moreover, the issue of nationalism points to a wider\ndomain of problems related to the treatment of ethnic and cultural\ndifferences within democratic polity, arguably among the most pressing\nproblems of contemporary political theory.\n\n\nIn the last two decades, migration crisis and the populist reactions\nto migration and domestic economic issues have been the defining\ntraits of a new political constellation. The traditional issue of the\ncontrast between nationalism and cosmopolitanism has changed its\nprofile: the current drastic contrast is between populist aversion to\nthe foreigners-migrants and a more generous, or simply just, attitude\nof acceptance and Samaritan help. The populist aversion inherits some\nfeatures traditionally associated with patriotism and nationalism, and\nthe opposite attitude the main features of traditional\ncosmopolitanism. One could expect that the work on nationalism will be\nmoving further on this new and challenging playground, addressing the\nnew contrast and trying to locate nationalism in relation to it.\n\n\nIn this entry, we shall first present conceptual issues of definition\nand classification (Sections 1 and 2) and then the arguments put\nforward in the debate (Section 3), dedicating more space to the\narguments in favor of nationalism than to those against it in order to\ngive the philosophical nationalist a proper hearing. In the last part\nwe shall turn to the new constellation and sketch the new issues\nraised by nationalist and trans-nationalist populisms and the\nmigration crisis.\n\n\nAlthough the term “nationalism” has a variety of meanings,\nit centrally encompasses two phenomena: (1) the attitude that the\nmembers of a nation have when they care about their identity as\nmembers of that nation and (2) the actions that the members of a\nnation take in seeking to achieve (or sustain) some form of political\nsovereignty (see for example, Nielsen 1998–9: 9). Each of these\naspects requires elaboration. \nThere is a terminological and conceptual question of distinguishing\nnationalism from patriotism. A popular proposal is the contrast\nbetween attachment to one’s country as defining patriotism and\nattachment to one’s people and its traditions as defining\nnationalism (Kleinig 2014: 228, and Primoratz 2017: Section 1.2). One\nproblem with this proposal is that love for a country is not really\njust love of a piece of land but normally involves attachment to the\ncommunity of its inhabitants, and this introduces “nation”\ninto the conception of patriotism. Another contrast is the one between\nstrong, and somewhat aggressive attachment (nationalism) and a mild\none (patriotism), dating back at least to George Orwell (see his 1945\nessay).[3] \nDespite these definitional worries, there is a fair amount of\nagreement about the classical, historically paradigmatic form of\nnationalism. It typically features the supremacy of the nation’s\nclaims over other claims to individual allegiance and full sovereignty\nas the persistent aim of its political program. Territorial\nsovereignty has traditionally been seen as a defining element of state\npower and essential for nationhood. It was extolled in classic modern\nworks by Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau and is returning to center stage\nin the debate, though philosophers are now more skeptical (see below).\nIssues surrounding the control of the movement of money and people (in\nparticular immigration) and the resource rights implied in territorial\nsovereignty make the topic politically central in the age of\nglobalization and philosophically interesting for nationalists and\nanti-nationalists alike. \nIn recent times, the philosophical focus has moved more in the\ndirection of “liberal nationalism”, the view that\nmitigates the classical claims and tries to bring together the\npro-national attitude and the respect for traditional liberal values.\nFor instance, the territorial state as political unit is seen by\nclassical nationalists as centrally “belonging” to one\nethnic-cultural group and as actively charged with protecting and\npromulgating its traditions. The liberal variety allows for\n“sharing” of the territorial state with non-dominant\nethnic groups. Consequences are varied and quite interested (for more\nsee below, especially\n section 2.1). \nIn its general form, the issue of nationalism concerns the mapping\nbetween the ethno-cultural domain (featuring ethno-cultural groups or\n“nations”) and the domain of political organization. In\nbreaking down the issue, we have mentioned the importance of the\nattitude that the members of a nation have when they care about their\nnational identity. This point raises two sorts of questions. First,\nthe descriptive ones: \nSecond, the normative ones: \nThis section discusses the descriptive questions, starting with\n (1a)\n and\n (1b);the\n normative questions are addressed in\n Section 3\n on the moral debate. If one wants to enjoin people to struggle for\ntheir national interests, one must have some idea about what a nation\nis and what it is to belong to a nation. So, in order to formulate and\nground their evaluations, claims, and directives for action,\npro-nationalist thinkers have expounded theories of ethnicity,\nculture, nation, and state. Their opponents have in turn challenged\nthese elaborations. Now, some presuppositions about ethnic groups and\nnations are essential for the nationalist, while others are\ntheoretical elaborations designed to support the essential ones. The\ndefinition and status of the social group that benefits from the\nnationalist program, variously called the “nation”,\n“ethno-nation”, or “ethnic group”, is\nessential. Since nationalism is particularly prominent with groups\nthat do not yet have a state, a definition of nation and nationalism\npurely in terms of belonging to a state is a non-starter. \nIndeed, purely “civic” loyalties are often categorized\nseparately under the title “patriotism”, which we already\nmentioned, or “constitutional\n patriotism”.[4]\n This leaves two extreme options and a number of intermediates. The\nfirst extreme option has been put forward by a small but distinguished\nband of\n theorists.[5]\n According to their purely voluntaristic definition, a nation is any\ngroup of people aspiring to a common political state-like\norganization. If such a group of people succeeds in forming a state,\nthe loyalties of the group members become “civic” (as\nopposed to “ethnic”) in nature. At the other extreme, and\nmore typically, nationalist claims are focused upon the non-voluntary\ncommunity of common origin, language, tradition, and culture: the\nclassic ethno-nation is a community of origin and culture, including\nprominently a language and customs. The distinction is related\n(although not identical) to that drawn by older schools of social and\npolitical science between “civic” and “ethnic”\nnationalism, the former being allegedly Western European and the\nlatter more Central and Eastern European, originating in\n Germany.[6]\n Philosophical discussions centered on nationalism tend to concern the\nethnic-cultural variants only, and this habit will be followed here. A\ngroup aspiring to nationhood on this basis will be called an\n“ethno-nation” to underscore its ethno-cultural rather\nthan purely civic underpinnings. For the ethno-(cultural) nationalist\nit is one’s ethnic-cultural background that determines\none’s membership in the community. One cannot choose to be a\nmember; instead, membership depends on the accident of origin and\nearly socialization. However, commonality of origin has become\nmythical for most contemporary candidate groups: ethnic groups have\nbeen mixing for millennia. \nSophisticated, liberal pro-nationalists therefore tend to stress\ncultural membership only and speak of “nationality”,\nomitting the “ethno-” part (Miller 1992, 2000; Tamir\n1993,2013; Gans 2003). Michel Seymour’s proposal of a\n“socio-cultural definition” adds a political dimension to\nthe purely cultural one: a nation is a cultural group, possibly but\nnot necessarily united by a common descent, endowed with civic ties\n(Seymour 2000). This is the kind of definition that would be accepted\nby most parties in the debate today. So defined, the nation is a\nsomewhat mixed category, both ethno-cultural and civic, but still\ncloser to the purely ethno-cultural than to the purely civic\nextreme. \nLet us now turn to the issue of the origin and\n“authenticity” of ethno-cultural groups or ethno-nations.\nIn social and political science one usually distinguishes two kinds of\nviews, but there is a third group, combining element from both. The\nfirst are modernist views that see nationalism as born in modern\ntimes, together with\n nation-states.[7]\n In our times the view was pioneered by Ernst Gellner (see his\n 1983).[8]\n Other modernist choose similar starting points with century or two of\n variation.[9]\n The opposite view can be called, following Edward Shils (1957) “primordialist”.\nAccording to it, actual ethno-cultural nations have either existed\n“since time immemorial”. \nThe third, quite plausible kind of view, distinct from both\nprimordialism-ethno-symbolism and modernism, has been initiated by W.\nConnor (1994).[10]\n A nation is a politicized and mobilized ethnic group rather than a\nstate. So, the origins of nationalism predate the modern state, and\nits emotional content remains up to our times (Conversi 2002: 270),\nbut the actual statist organization is, indeed, modern. However,\nnation-state is a nationalist dream and fiction, never really\nimplemented, due to the inescapable plurality of social groups. So\nmuch for the three dominant perspectives on the origin of\nnationalism. \nIndeed, the older authors—from great thinkers like Herder and\nOtto Bauer to the propagandists who followed their\nfootsteps—took great pains to ground normative claims upon firm\nontological realism about nations: nations are real, bona\nfide entities. However, the contemporary moral debate has tried\nto diminish the importance of the imagined/real divide. Prominent\ncontemporary philosophers have claimed that normative-evaluative\nnationalist claims are compatible with the “imagined”\nnature of a\n nation.[11]\n They point out that common imaginings can tie people together, and\nthat actual interaction resulting from togetherness can engender\nimportant moral obligations. \nLet us now turn to question\n (1c)\n about the nature of pro-national attitudes. The explanatory issue\nthat has interested political and social scientists concerns\nethno-nationalist sentiment, the paradigm case of a pro-national\nattitude. Is it as irrational, romantic, and indifferent to\nself-interest as it might seem on the surface? The issue has divided\nauthors who see nationalism as basically irrational and those who try\nto explain it as being in some sense rational. Authors who see it as\nirrational propose various explanations of why people assent to\nirrational views. Some say, critically, that nationalism is based on\n“false consciousness”. But where does such false\nconsciousness come from? The most simplistic view is that it is a\nresult of direct manipulation of “masses” by\n“elites”. On the opposite side, the famous critic of\nnationalism Elie Kedourie (1960) thinks this irrationality is\nspontaneous. A decade and a half ago Liah Greenfeld went as far as\nlinking nationalism to mental illness in her provocative 2005 article\n(see also her 2006 book). On the opposite side, Michael Walzer has\noffered a sympathetic account of nationalist passion in his 2002.\nAuthors relying upon the Marxist tradition offer various deeper\nexplanations. To mention one, the French structuralist Étienne\nBalibar sees it as a result of the “production” of\nideology effectuated by mechanisms which have nothing to do with\nspontaneous credulity of individuals, but with impersonal, structural\nsocial factors (Balibar & Wallerstein 1988\n [1991]).[12] \nSome authors claim that it is often rational for individuals to become\nnationalists (Hardin 1985). Can one rationally explain the extremes of\nethno-national conflict? Authors like Russell Hardin propose to do so\nin terms of a general view of when hostile behavior is rational: most\ntypically, if an individual has no reason to trust someone, it is\nreasonable for that individual to take precautions against the other.\nIf both sides take precautions, however, each will tend to see the\nother as increasingly inimical. It then becomes rational to start\ntreating the other as an enemy. Mere suspicion can thus lead by small,\nindividually rational steps to a situation of conflict. (Such negative\ndevelopment is often presented as a variant of the Prisoner’s\nDilemma; see the entry on\n prisoner’s dilemma).\n It is relatively easy to spot the circumstances in which this general\npattern applies to national solidarities and conflicts (see also\nWimmer 2013). \nFinally, as for question\n (1d),\n the nation is typically seen as an essentially non-voluntary\ncommunity to which one belongs by birth and early nurture and such\nthat the belonging is enhanced and made more complete by one’s\nadditional conscious endorsement. Not everyone agrees: liberal\nnationalists accept the idea of choice of one’s national\nbelonging and of possibility for immigrants to become nationals by\nchoice and intentional acculturation. \nWe pointed out at the very beginning of the entry that nationalism\nfocuses upon (1) the attitude that the members of a nation have when\nthey care about their national identity, and (2) the actions that the\nmembers of a nation take when seeking to achieve (or sustain) some\nform of political sovereignty. The politically central point is (2):\nthe actions enjoined by the nationalist. To these we now turn,\nbeginning with sovereignty and territory, the usual foci of a national\nstruggle for independence. They raise an important issue: \nThe classical answer is that a state is required. A more liberal\nanswer is that some form of political autonomy suffices. Once this has\nbeen discussed, we can turn to the related normative issues: \nConsider first the classical nationalist answer to\n (2a).\n Political sovereignty requires a state “rightfully owned”\nby the ethno-nation (Oldenquist 1997). Developments of this line of\nthought often state or imply specific answers to\n (2b),\n and\n (2c),\n i.e., that in a national independence struggle the use of force\nagainst the threatening central power is almost always a legitimate\nmeans for bringing about sovereignty. However, classical nationalism\nis not only concerned with the creation of a state but also with its\nmaintenance and strengthening. \nClassical nationalism is the political program that sees the\ncreation and maintenance of a fully sovereign state owned by a given\nethno-national group (“people” or “nation”) as\na primary duty of each member of the group. Starting from the\nassumption that the appropriate (or “natural”) unit of\nculture is an ethno-nation, it claims that a primary duty of each\nmember is to abide by one’s recognizably ethno-national culture\nin all cultural matters. \nClassical nationalists are usually vigilant about the kind of culture\nthey protect and promote and about the kind of attitude people have to\ntheir nation-state. This watchful attitude carries some potential\ndangers: many elements of a given culture that are universal or simply\nnot recognizably national may fall prey to such nationalist\nenthusiasms. Classical nationalism in everyday life puts various\nadditional demands on individuals, from buying more expensive\nhome-produced goods in preference to cheaper imported ones to\nprocreating as many future members of the nation as one can manage\n(see Yuval-Davies 1997, and Yack 2012). \nBesides classical nationalism (and its more radical extremist\ncousins), various moderate views are also now classified as\nnationalist. Indeed, the philosophical discussion has shifted to these\nmoderate or even ultra-moderate forms, and most philosophers who\ndescribe themselves as nationalists propose very moderate nationalist\nprograms. \nNationalism in this wider sense is any complex of attitudes,\nclaims, and directives for action ascribing a fundamental political,\nmoral, and cultural value to nation and nationality and deriving\nobligations (for individual members of the nation, and for any\ninvolved third parties, individual or collective) from this ascribed\nvalue. The main representative of this group of views is liberal\nnationalism, proposed by authors like Miller, Tamir, and Gans\n(see below). \nNationalisms in this wider sense can vary somewhat in their\nconceptions of the nation (which are often left implicit in their\ndiscourse), in the grounds for and degree of its value, and in the\nscope of their prescribed obligations. Moderate nationalism is less\ndemanding than classical nationalism and sometimes goes under the name\nof “patriotism.” (A different usage, again, reserves\n“patriotism” for valuing civic community and loyalty to\nstate, in contrast to nationalism, centered on ethnic-cultural\ncommunities). \nLet us now turn to liberal nationalism, the most discussed kind of\nmoderate nationalism. \nLiberal nationalists see liberal-democratic principles and\npro-national attitudes as belonging together. One of the main\nproponents of the view, Yael Tamir, started the debate in her 1993\nbook and in her recent book talks about the nation-state as “an\nideal meeting point between the two” (2019: 6). Of course, some\nthings have to be sacrificed: we must acknowledge that either the\nmeaningfulness of a community or its openness must be sacrificed to\nsome extent as we cannot have them both. (2019: 57). How much of each\nis to give way is left open, and of course, various liberal\nnationalists take different views of what precisely the right answer\nis. \nTamir’s version of liberal nationalism is a kind of social\nliberalism, in this respect similar to the views of David Miller who\ntalks about “solidaristic communities” in his 1999 book\nPrinciples of Social Justice and also takes stance in his\n1995 and 2008 books. They both see the feeling of national identity as\na feeling that promotes solidarity, and solidarity as means for\nincreased social justice (Tamir 2019, in particular ch.20; compare\nWalzer 1983, Kymlicka 1995a, 2001, and Gans 2003, 2008). \nLiberal nationalists diverge about the value of multiculturalism.\nKymlicka takes it as basic for his picture of liberalism while Tamir\ndismisses it without much ado: multicultural, multiethnic democracies\nhave a very poor track record, she claims (2019: 62). Tamir’s\ndiagnosis of the present day political crisis, with politicians like\nTrump and Le Pen coming to the forefront, is that “liberal\ndemocrats were paralyzed by their assumed victory” whereas\n“nationalists felt defeated and obsolete” (2019: 7). \nTamir lists two kinds of reasons that guarantee special political\nstatus to nations. First kind, that no other political entity\n“is more able than the state to promote ideas in the public\nsphere” (2019: 52), and the second kind that nation needs\ncontinuous creative effort to make it functional and attractive. \nThe historical development of liberalism turned it into a\nuniversalistic, anti-communitarian principle; this has been a fatal\nmistake that can be and should be corrected by the liberal nationalist\nsynthesis. Can we revive the unifying narratives of our nationality\nwithout sacrificing the liberal inheritance of freedom and rights?\nLiberal nationalism answers in the affirmative. From its standpoint,\nnational particularism has primacy: “The love of humanity is a\nnoble ideal, but real love is always particular…” (2019:\n68). \nInterestingly, Tamir combines this high regard of nation with an\nextreme constructivist view of its nature: nations are mental\nstructures that exist in the minds of their members (2019: 58). \nIs liberal nationalism implemented anywhere in the present world, or\nis it more of an ideal, probably end-state theory, that proposes a\npicture of a desirable society? Judging by the writings of liberal\nnationalists, it is the latter, although presented as a relatively\neasily reachable ideal, combining two traditions that are already well\nimplemented in political reality. \nThe variations of nationalism most relevant for philosophy are those\nthat influence the moral standing of claims and of recommended\nnationalist practices. The elaborate philosophical views put forward\nin favor of nationalism will be referred to as “theoretical\nnationalism”, the adjective serving to distinguish such views\nfrom less sophisticated and more practical nationalist discourse. The\ncentral theoretical nationalist evaluative claims can be charted on\nthe map of possible positions within political theory in the following\nuseful but somewhat simplified and schematic way. \nNationalist claims featuring the nation as central to political action\nmust answer two crucial general questions. First, is there one kind of\nlarge social group that is of special moral importance? The\nnationalist answer is that there certainly is one, namely, the nation.\nMoreover, when an ultimate choice is to be made, say between ties of\nfamily, or friendship, and the nation, the latter has priority.\nLiberal nationalists prefer a more moderate stance, which ascribes\nvalue to national belonging, but don’t make it central in this\nway. Second, what are the grounds for an individual’s\nobligations to the morally central group? Are they based on voluntary\nor involuntary membership in the group? The typical contemporary\nnationalist thinker opts for the latter, while admitting that\nvoluntary endorsement of one’s national identity is a morally\nimportant achievement. On the philosophical map, pro-nationalist\nnormative tastes fit nicely with the communitarian stance in general:\nmost pro-nationalist philosophers are communitarians who choose the\nnation as the preferred community (in contrast to those of their\nfellow communitarians who prefer more far-ranging communities, such as\nthose defined by global religious\n traditions).[13] \nBefore proceeding to moral claims, let us briefly sketch the issues\nand viewpoints connected to territory and territorial rights that are\nessential for nationalist political \n programs.[14] \n Why is territory\nimportant for ethno-national groups, and what are the extent and\ngrounds of territorial rights? Its primary importance resides in\nsovereignty and all the associated possibilities for internal control\nand external exclusion. Add to this the Rousseauian view that\npolitical attachments are essentially bounded and that love —or,\nto put it more mildly, republican civil friendship—for\none’s group requires exclusion of some “other”, and\nthe importance becomes quite obvious. What about the grounds for the\ndemand for territorial rights? Nationalist and pro-nationalist views\nmostly rely on the attachment that members of a nation have to\nnational territory and to the formative value of territory for a\nnation to justify territorial claims (see Miller 2000 and Meisels\n2009). This is similar in some respects to the rationale given by\nproponents of indigenous peoples’ rights (Tully 2004, but see\nalso Hendrix 2008) and in other respects to Kolers’ 2009\nethno-geographical non-nationalist theory, but differs in preferring\nethno-national groups as the sole carriers of the right. These\nattachment views stand in stark contrast to more pragmatic views about\nterritorial rights as means for conflict resolution (e.g., Levy 2000).\nAnother quite popular alternative is the family of individualistic\nviews grounding territorial rights in rights and interests of\nindividuals.[15]\n On the extreme end of anti-nationalist views\nstands the idea of Pogge) that there are no specific territorial\nproblems for political philosophy—the “dissolution\napproach”, as Kolers calls it. \nWe now pass to the normative dimension of nationalism. We shall first\ndescribe the very heart of the nationalist program, i.e., sketch and\nclassify the typical normative and evaluative nationalist claims.\nThese claims can be seen as answers to the normative subset of our\ninitial questions about (1) pro-national attitudes and (2)\nactions. \nWe will see that these claims recommend various courses of action:\ncentrally, those meant to secure and sustain a political organization\nfor the given ethno-cultural national community (thereby making more\nspecific the answers to our normative questions\n (1e),\n (1f),\n (2b),\n and\n (2c)).\n Further, they enjoin the community’s members to promulgate\nrecognizable ethno-cultural contents as central features of the\ncultural life within such a state. Finally, we shall discuss various\nlines of pro-nationalist thought that have been put forward in defense\nof these claims. To begin, let us return to the claims concerning the\nfurthering of the national state and culture. These are proposed by\nthe nationalist as norms of conduct. The philosophically most\nimportant variations concern three aspects of such normative\nclaims: \nUniversalizing nationalism is the political program that\nclaims that every ethno-nation should have a state that it\nshould rightfully own and the interests of which it should\npromote. \nAlternatively, a claim may be particularistic, such as the claim\n“Group X ought to have a state”, where this\nimplies nothing about any other group: \nParticularistic nationalism is the political program claiming\nthat some ethno-nation should have its state, without\nextending the claim to all ethno-nations. It claims thus either \nThe most difficult and indeed chauvinistic sub-case of particularism,\ni.e., (B), has been called “invidious” since it explicitly\ndenies the privilege of having a state to some peoples. Serious\ntheoretical nationalists usually defend only the universalist variety,\nwhereas the nationalist-in-the-street most often defends the egoistic\nindeterminate one. \nThe nationalist picture of morality traditionally has been quite close\nto the dominant view in the theory of international relations called\n“realism”. Put starkly, the view is that morality ends at\nthe boundaries of the nation-state; beyond there is nothing but\n anarchy.[16]\n It nicely complements the main classical nationalist claim about the\nnation-state, i.e., that each ethno-nation or people should have a\nstate of its own, and suggests what happens next: nation-states enter\ninto competition in the name of their constitutive peoples. \nRecall the initial normative question centered around (1) attitudes\nand (2) actions. Is national partiality justified, and to what extent?\nWhat actions are appropriate to bring about sovereignty? In\nparticular, are ethno-national states and institutionally protected\n(ethno-) national cultures goods independent from the individual will\nof their members, and how far may one go in protecting them? The\nphilosophical debate for and against nationalism is a debate about the\nmoral validity of its central claims. In particular, the ultimate\nmoral issue is the following: is any form of nationalism morally\npermissible or justified, and, if not, how bad are particular forms of\n it?[17]\n Why do nationalist claims require a defense? In some situations they\nseem plausible: for instance, the plight of some stateless national\ngroups—the history of Jews and Armenians, the historical and\ncontemporary misfortunes of Kurds—lends credence to the idea\nthat having their own state would have solved the worst problems.\nStill, there are good reasons to examine nationalist claims more\ncarefully. The most general reason is that it should first be shown\nthat the political form of the nation-state has some value as such,\nthat a national community has a particular, or even central, moral and\npolitical value, and that claims in its favor have normative validity.\nOnce this is established, a further defense is needed. Some classical\nnationalist claims appear to clash—at least under normal\ncircumstances of contemporary life—with various values that\npeople tend to accept. Some of these values are considered essential\nto liberal-democratic societies, while others are important\nspecifically for the flourishing of creativity and culture. The main\nvalues in the first set are individual autonomy and benevolent\nimpartiality (most prominently towards members of groups culturally\ndifferent from one’s own). The alleged special duties towards\none’s ethno-national culture can and often do interfere with\nindividuals’ right to autonomy. \nLiberal nationalists are aware of the difficulties of the classical\napproach, and soften the classical claims, giving them only a\nprima facie status. They usually speak of “various\naccretions that have given nationalism a bad name”, and they are\neager to “separate the idea of nationality itself from these\nexcesses” (Miller 1992, 2000). Such thoughtful pro-nationalist\nwriters have participated in an ongoing philosophical dialogue between\nproponents and opponents of the\n claim.[18]\n In order to help the reader find their through this involved debate,\nwe shall briefly summarize the considerations which are open to the\nethno-nationalist to defend their case (compare the useful overview in\nLichtenberg 1997). Further lines of thought built upon these\nconsiderations can be used to defend very different varieties of\nnationalism, from radical to very moderate ones. \nFor brevity, each line of thought will be reduced to a brief argument;\nthe actual debate is more involved than one can represent in a sketch.\nSome prominent lines of criticism that have been put forward in the\ndebate will be indicated in brackets (see Miscevic 2001). The main\narguments in favor of nationalism will be divided into two sets. The\nfirst set of arguments defends the claim that national communities\nhave a high value, sometime seen as coming from the interests of their\nindividual member (e.g., by Kymlicka, Miller, and Raz) and sometimes\nas non-instrumental and independent of the wishes and choices of their\nindividual members, and argues that they should therefore be protected\nby means of state and official statist policies. The second set is\nless deeply “comprehensive”, and encompasses arguments\nfrom the requirements of justice, independent from substantial\nassumptions about culture and cultural values. \nThe first set will be presented in more detail since it has formed the\ncore of the debate. It depicts the community as the source of value or\nas the transmission device connecting its members to some important\nvalues. For the classical nationalist, the arguments from this set are\ncommunitarian in a particularly “deep” sense since they\nare grounded in basic features of the human condition. \nThe general form of deep communitarian arguments is as follows. First,\nthe communitarian premise: there is some uncontroversial good (e.g., a\nperson’s identity), and some kind of community is essential for\nacquisition and preservation of it. Then comes the claim that the\nethno-cultural nation is the kind of community ideally suited for this\ntask. Then follows the statist conclusion: in order for such a\ncommunity to preserve its own identity and support the identity of its\nmembers, it has to assume (always or at least normally) the political\nform of a state. The conclusion of this type of argument is that the\nethno-national community has the right to an ethno-national state and\nthe citizens of the state have the right and obligation to favor their\nown ethnic culture in relation to any other. \nAlthough the deeper philosophical assumptions in the arguments stem\nfrom the communitarian tradition, weakened forms have also been\nproposed by more liberal philosophers. The original communitarian\nlines of thought in favor of nationalism suggest that there is some\nvalue in preserving ethno-national cultural traditions, in feelings of\nbelonging to a common nation, and in solidarity between a\nnation’s members. A liberal nationalist might claim that these\nare not the central values of political life but are values\nnevertheless. Moreover, the diametrically opposing views, pure\nindividualism and cosmopolitanism, do seem arid, abstract, and\nunmotivated by comparison. By cosmopolitanism we refer to moral and\npolitical doctrines claiming that \nConfronted with opposing forces of nationalism and cosmopolitanism,\nmany philosophers opt for a mixture of liberalism-cosmopolitanism and\npatriotism-nationalism. In his writings, B. Barber glorifies “a\nremarkable mixture of cosmopolitanism and parochialism” that in\nhis view characterizes American national identity (Barber 1996: 31).\nCharles Taylor claims that “we have no choice but to be\ncosmopolitan and patriots” (Taylor 1996: 121). Hilary Putnam\nproposes loyalty to what is best in the multiple traditions in which\neach of us participates, apparently a middle way between a\nnarrow-minded patriotism and an overly abstract cosmopolitanism\n(Putnam 1996: 114). The compromise has been foreshadowed by Berlin\n(1979) and Taylor (1989,\n 1993),[19]\n and in the last two decades it has occupied center stage in the\ndebate and even provoked re-readings of historical nationalism in its\n light.[20]\n Most liberal nationalist authors accept various weakened versions of\nthe arguments we list below, taking them to support moderate or\nultra-moderate nationalist claims. \nHere are then the main weakenings of classical ethno-nationalism that\nliberal, limited-liberal, and cosmopolitan nationalists propose.\nFirst, ethno-national claims have only prima facie strength\nand cannot trump individual rights. Second, legitimate ethno-national\nclaims do not in themselves automatically amount to the right to a\nstate, but rather to the right to a certain level of cultural\nautonomy. The main models of autonomy are either territorial or\nnon-territorial: the first involves territorial devolution; the\nsecond, cultural autonomy granted to individuals regardless of their\ndomicile within the\n state.[21]\n Third, ethno-nationalism is subordinate to civic patriotism, which\nhas little or nothing to do with ethnic criteria. Fourth,\nethno-national mythologies and similar “important\nfalsehoods” are to be tolerated only if benign and inoffensive,\nin which case they are morally permissible despite their falsity.\nFinally, any legitimacy that ethno-national claims may have is to be\nderived from choices the concerned individuals are free to make. \nConsider now the particular pro-nationalist arguments from the first\nset. The first argument depends on assumptions that also appear in the\nsubsequent ones, but it further ascribes to the community an intrinsic\nvalue. The later arguments point more towards an instrumental value of\nnation, derived from the value of individual flourishing, moral\nunderstanding, firm identity and the like. \nThe Canadian liberal nationalists Seymour (1999), Taylor, and Kymlicka\npointed out that “divergences of value between different regions\nof Canada” that aspire to separate nationhood are\n“minimal”. Taylor (1993: 155) concluded that it is not\nseparateness of value that matters. \nThe ‘physiognomies’ of cultures are unique: each presents\na wonderful exfoliation of human potentialities in its own time and\nplace and environment. We are forbidden to make judgments of\ncomparative value, for that is measuring the incommensurable. (1976:\n206) \nAssuming that the (ethno-)nation is the natural unit of culture, the\npreservation of cultural diversity amounts to institutionally\nprotecting the purity of (ethno-)national culture. The plurality of\ncultural styles can be preserved and enhanced by tying them to\nethno-national “forms of life”.  David Miller has developed an interesting and sophisticated\nliberal pro-national stance over the course of decades from his work\nin 1990 to the most recent work in 2013. He accepts multicultural\ndiversity within a society but stresses an overarching national\nidentity, taking as his prime example British national identity, which\nencompasses the English, Scottish, and other ethnic identities. He\ndemands an “inclusive identity, accessible to members of all\ncultural groups” (2013: 91). miller claims such identity is\nnecessary for basic social solidarity, and it goes far beyond simple\nconstitutional patriotism. A skeptic could note the following. The\nproblem with multicultural society is that national identity has\nhistorically been a matter of ethno-national ties and has required\nsameness in the weighted majority of cultural traits (common language,\ncommon “history-as-remembered”, customs, religion and so\non). However, multi-cultural states typically bring together groups\nwith very different histories, languages, religions, and even quite\ncontrasting appearances. Now, how is the overarching “national\nidentity” to be achieved starting from the very thin identity of\ncommon belonging to a state? One seems to have a dilemma. Grounding\nsocial solidarity in national identity requires the latter to be\nrather thin and seems likely to end up as full-on, unitary cultural\nidentity. Thick constitutional patriotism may be one interesting\npossible attitude that can ground such solidarity while preserving the\noriginal cultural diversity. \nThe arguments in the second set concern political justice and do not\nrely on metaphysical claims about identity, flourishing, and cultural\nvalues. They appeal to (actual or alleged) circumstances that would\nmake nationalist policies reasonable (or permissible or even\nmandatory), such as (a) the fact that a large part of the world is\norganized into nation-states (so that each new group aspiring to\ncreate a nation-state just follows an established pattern), or (b) the\ncircumstances of group self-defense or of redressing past injustice\nthat might justify nationalist policies (to take a special case). Some\nof the arguments also present nationhood as conducive to important\npolitical goods, such as equality. \nAndreas Wimmer (2018) presents an interesting discussion of the\nhistorical success of nation-state (discussed in Knott, Tolz, Green,\n& Wimmer 2019). \nThese political arguments can be combined with deep communitarian\nones. However, taken in isolation, their perspectives offer a\n“liberal culturalism” that is more suitable for\nethno-culturally plural societies. More remote from classical\nnationalism than the liberal one of Tamir and Nielsen, it eschews any\ncommunitarian philosophical\n underpinning.[23]\n The idea of moderate nation-building points to an open\nmulti-culturalism in which every group receives its share of remedial\nrights but, instead of walling itself off from others, participates in\na common, overlapping civic culture in open communication with other\nsub-communities. Given the variety of pluralistic societies and\nintensity of trans-national interactions, such openness seems to many\nto be the only guarantee of stable social and political life (see the\ndebate in Shapiro and Kymlicka 1997). \nIn general, the liberal nationalist stance is mild and civil, and\nthere is much to be said in favor of it. It tries to reconcile our\nintuitions in favor of some sort of political protection of cultural\ncommunities with a liberal political morality. Of course, this raises\nissues of compatibility between liberal universal principles and the\nparticular attachments to one’s ethno-cultural nation. Very\nliberal nationalists such as Tamir divorce ethno-cultural nationhood\nfrom statehood. Also, the kind of love for country they suggest is\ntempered by all kinds of universalist considerations, which in the\nlast instance trump national interest (Tamir 1993: 115; 2019: passim,\nsee also Moore 2001 and Gans 2003). There is an ongoing debate among\nphilosophical nationalists about how much weakening and compromising\nis still compatible with a stance’s being nationalist at\n all.[24]\n There is also a streak of cosmopolitan interest present in the work\nof some liberal nationalists (Nielsen\n 1998–99).[25] \nIn the last two decades, the issues of nationalism have been\nincreasingly integrated into the debate about the international order\n(see the entries on\n globalization\n and\n cosmopolitanism).\n The main conceptual link is the claim that nation-states are natural,\nstable, and suitable units of the international order. A related\ndebate concerns the role of minorities in the processes of\nglobalization (see Kaldor 2004). Moreover, the two approaches might\nultimately converge: a multiculturalist liberal nationalism and a\nmoderate, difference-respecting cosmopolitanism have a lot in\n common.[26] \n“Populism” is an umbrella term, covering both right-wing\nand left-wing varieties. This section will pay attention to right-wing\npopulist movements, very close to their traditional nationalist\npredecessors. This corresponds to the situation in the biggest part of\nEurope, and in the US, where nationalist topics are being put forward\nby the right-wing\n populist.[27] \nHowever, it has become quite clear that nationalism is only one of the\npolitical “isms” attracting the right-wing populists. The\nmigration crisis has brought to the forefront populist\nself-identification with linguistic-cultural communities (“we,\nFrench speaking people” for the former, “we\nChristians” for the later) that goes beyond nationalism. \nJan-Werner Müller (2016) and Cas Mudde (2007) note that the form\ncommon to all sorts of populism is quite simple and describe it as\n“thin”. Mudde explains: “Populism is understood as a\nthin-centered ideology that considers society to be ultimately\nseparated into two homogeneous and antagonistic groups, ‘the\npure people’ versus ‘the corrupt elite’, and which\nargues that politics should be an expression of the volonté\ngénérale (general will) of the People” (2007:\n23). Populism, so defined, has two opposites: elitism and pluralism.\nFirst, there is the elite vs. people (“underdog”)\ncontrast. Second, it is possible to distinguish two ways of\ncharacterizing “the people”: either in terms of social\nstatus (class, income-level, etc.) or in terms of ethnic and/or\ncultural belonging (see also de Cleen 2017). \nThe second, horizontal dimension distinguishes the predominantly\nleft-wing from the predominantly right-wing populisms and leaves a\nplace for a centrist populist option. Take classical strong ethnic\nnationalism. The relation between right-wing populism and such a\nnationalism is very tight. This has led some theoreticians (Taguieff\n2015) to present “nationalist populism” as the only kind\nof populism. The term captures exactly the synthesis of populism and\nthe strong ethnic nationalism or nativism. From populism, it takes the\ngeneral schema of anti-elitism: the leader is addressing directly the\npeople and is allegedly following the people’s interest.  From\nnationalism, it takes the characterization of the people: it is the\nethnic community, in most cases the state-owing ethnic community, or\nthe ethno-nation. In his work, Mudde documents the claim that purely\nright-wing populists claim to represent the true people who form the\ntrue nation and whose purity is being muddied by new entrants. In the\nUnited States, one can talk about populist and reactionary movements,\nlike the Tea Party, that have emerged through the recent experience of\nimmigration, terrorist attacks, and growing economic polarization. We\nhave to set aside here, for reasons of space, the main populist\nalternative (or quasi-alternative) to national populism. In some\ncountries, like Germany, some populist groups-parties (e.g., German\nAfD party (Alternative for Germany)), appeal to properties much wider\nin their reach than ethno-national belonging, typically to religious\naffiliations. Others combine this appeal with the ethno-national\none. This yields what Riva Kastoryano (2006) calls “transnational\nnationalism”. \nInterestingly, liberal nationalism is not very attractive to the\npopulists. On the theoretical side one can note that Tamir (2019) sees\nher liberal nationalism as a good recipe against the threat of\ndemagogues like Trump and Boris Johnson (she avoids the use of the\nlabel “populist”, e.g., 2019: 31). \nThe rise of populism is changing the political playfield one must work\nwith. The tolerant (liberal nationalist or anti-nationalist) views are\nconfronting new problems in the populist age marked by migration\ncrisis, etc. The dangers traditionally associated with military\npresence are gone; the national populists have to invent and construct\na presumed danger that comes into the country together with foreign\nfamilies, including those with children. In short, if these\nconjectures hold, the politicians and theoreticians are faced with a\nchange. The traditional issue of the contrast between\npatriotism/nationalism and cosmopolitanism has changed its profile:\nthe current drastic contrast is between the populist aversion to the\nforeigners-migrants and a more generous attitude of acceptance and\nSamaritan help. Finally, the populist understanding of “our\npeople” (“we-community”) encompasses not only\nnationalist options but also goes way beyond it. The important element\nis the promiscuous character of the populist choices. It is probable\nthat the future scholarship on nationalism will mainly focus on this\nnew and challenging playfield, with an aim to address the new contrast\nand locate kinds of nationalism in relation to\n it.[28] \nThe migration crisis has made the nation-state in global context the\ncentral political topic concerning nationality. Before moving on to\ncurrent events, the state of art before the crisis should be\nsummarized. First, consider the debates on territory and nation and\nissues of global justice. \nLiberal nationalists try to preserve the traditional nationalist link\nbetween ethnic “ownership” of the state and sovereignty\nand territorial control, but in a much more flexible and sophisticated\nsetting. Tamar Meisels thus argues in favor of “taking existing\nnational settlements into account as a central factor in demarcating\nterritorial boundaries” since this line “has both liberal\nfoundations” (i.e., in the work of John Locke) and\nliberal-national appeal (2009: 159) grounded in its affinity with the\nliberal doctrine of national self-determination. She combines it with\nChaim Gans’ (2003: Ch. 4) interpretation of “historical\nright” claims as “the right to formative\nterritories”. She thus combines “historical arguments,\nunderstood as claims to formative territories”, with her\nargument from settlement and insists on their interplay and mutual\nreinforcement, presenting them as being “most closely related\nto, and based on, liberal nationalist assumptions and underlying\nideas” (Meisels 2009: 160). She nevertheless stresses that more\nthan one ethnic group can have formative ties to a given territory,\nand that there might be competing claims based on\n settlement.[29]\n But, given the ethno-national conflicts of the twentieth century, one\ncan safely assume that culturally plural states divided into isolated\nand closed sub-communities glued together merely by arrangements of\nmodus vivendi are inherently unstable. Stability might\ntherefore require that the pluralist society envisioned by liberal\nculturalists promote quite intense intra-state interaction between\ncultural groups in order to forestall mistrust, reduce prejudice, and\ncreate a solid basis for cohabitation. \nBut where should one stop? The question arises since there are many\ngeographically open, interacting territories of various sizes.\nConsider first the geographical openness of big continental planes,\nthen add the modern ease of interaction (“No island is an island\nany more”, one could say), and, finally and dramatically, the\nsubstantial ecological interconnectedness of land and climate. Here,\nthe tough nationalistic line is no longer proposed seriously in\nethical debates, so the furthest pro-national extreme is in fact a\nrelatively moderate stance, exemplified by Miller in the works listed.\nHere is a typical proposal of his concerning global justice based on\nnation-states: it might become a matter of national pride to have set\naside a certain percentage of GDP for developmental\ngoals—perhaps for projects in one particular country or group of\ncountries (2013: 182). \nThis brings us to the topic of migrations, and the heated debate on\nthe present\n scene.[30]\n In Europe immigration is probably the main topic of the present day\npopulist uproar, and in the United States it is one of the main\ntopics. So, immigration plus the nationalist-populist reactions to it\nare in the current decade the main testing ground for nationalist and\ncosmopolitan views. \nLet’s look at the pro-national side in the debate. Liberal\nnationalists, in particular Miller, have put forward some thoughtful\npro-nationalist proposal concerning immigration. Miller’s\nproposal allows refugees to seek asylum temporarily until the\nsituation in their country of origin improves; it also limits economic\nmigration. Miller argues against the defensibility of a global\nstandard for equality, opportunity, welfare, etc., because measures of\njust equality are context-bound. People do have the right to a minimum\nstandard of living, but the right to migrate only activates as a last\nresort after all other measures within a candidate-migrant’s\ncountry of origin have been tried. However, he also (particularly in\nhis book on “Strangers in our midst”, 2016), claims that\nnational responsibility to accept immigrant refugees is balanced by\nconsiderations of the interest of would-be immigrants and the\ninterests that national communities have in maintaining control over\ntheir own composition and character. \nIf we agree with the liberal nationalists on the positive side, we can\nask about the dynamics of the help required for the immigrants.\nDistinguish at least three stages, first, the immediate emergency\n(starvation, freezing, urgent medical problems) and catering to it,\nsecond, settlement and learning (on the host and the immigrant\nnewcomer side), and third, the stage of (some kind of) citizenship, of\nrelatively stable life in the host country. \nIn the first phase, the immediate help comes first, both normatively\nand causally: just accept the would-be refugees (indeed, the would-be\nrefugees should be helped in leaving their countries and travelling to\nthe host country). In longer term, staying should involve opportunity\nfor work and training. \nBut there is more. The Samaritan obligation can and should function as\na preparation for wider global\n activity.[31]\n So, we have two theoretical steps, first, accepting Samaritanism and\nsecond, agreeing with deeper trans-national measure of blocking\ndistant causes, like poverty and wars in the Third world. Let us call\nthis “Samaritan-to-deeper-measures model”. The model is\ngeared to the dramatically changed playground in which the nationalism\nissues are played out in the context of populism and refugee crisis,\nraising issues that were not around two decades ago. \nIn presenting the claims that the pro-nationalists defend, we have\nproceeded from the more radical towards more liberal nationalist\nalternatives. In examining the arguments for these claims, we have\npresented metaphysically demanding communitarian arguments resting\nupon deep communitarian assumptions about culture, such as the premise\nthat the ethno-cultural nation is the most important community for all\nindividuals. This is an interesting and respectable claim, but its\nplausibility has not been established. The moral debate about\nnationalism has resulted in various weakenings of culture-based\narguments, typically proposed by liberal nationalists, which render\nthe arguments less ambitious but much more plausible. Having abandoned\nthe old nationalist ideal of a state owned by a single dominant\nethno-cultural group, liberal nationalists have become receptive to\nthe idea that identification with a plurality of cultures and\ncommunities is important for a person’s social identity. They\nhave equally become sensitive to trans-national issues and more\nwilling to embrace a partly cosmopolitan perspective. Liberal\nnationalism has also brought to the fore more modest, less\nphilosophically or metaphysically charged arguments grounded in\nconcerns about justice. These stress the practical importance of\nethno-cultural membership, ethno-cultural groups’ rights to have\ninjustices redressed, democratic rights of political association, and\nthe role that ethno-cultural ties and associations can play in\npromoting just social arrangements. \nThe events in the current decade, the refugee crisis and the rise of\nright-wing populism, have dramatically changed the relevant practical\nand theoretical playground. The traditional nationalism is still\nrelevant, but populist nationalism attracts much more attention: new\ntheories are being produced and debated, coming to occupy the center\nstage. On the other hand, migration crisis has replaced the typical\ncosmopolitan issue of solidarity-with-distant-strangers with burning\nissues of helping refugees present at our doors. Of course, the causes\nof the crisis are still the same ones that cosmopolitans have been\nworrying about much earlier: wars and dramatically unequal global\ndistribution of goods, and of threats, like illnesses and climate\ndisasters. The task of the theory is now to connect these deeper\nissues with the new problems occupying the center-stage of the new\nplayground; it is a challenge now formulated in somewhat different\nvocabulary and within different political conceptual frameworks than\nbefore.","contact.mail":"vismiscevic@ceu.hu","contact.domain":"ceu.hu"}]
