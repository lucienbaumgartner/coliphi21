Davis","entry":"simone-weil","body.text":"\n\n\nSimone Weil (1909–1943) philosophized on thresholds and across\nborders. Her persistent desire for truth and justice led her to both\nelite academies and factory floors, political praxis and spiritual\nsolitude. At different times she was an activist, a pacifist, a\nmilitant, a mystic, and an exile; but throughout, in her inquiry into\nreality and orientation to the good, she remained a philosopher. Her\noeuvre features deliberate contradiction yet demonstrates remarkable\nclarity. It is value centered and integrated but not systematic. It\ncontains scattered notes of her translations of and commentaries on\nseveral ancient Greek texts, Pythagorean geometry formulae, and\ndetailed accounts of her daily tasks within a factory; but her oeuvre\nis also composed of addresses to political, industrial, and religious\nleaders as well as pieces intended for university students, radical\nmilitants, industrial workers, and farm laborers. In both her life and\nher thought—itself an unstable distinction with respect to\nWeil—she is a philosopher of margins and paradoxes. In part\nbecause Weil’s thought defies categorization, the ways in which\nher ideas are taken up often say as much about her commentator as they\ndo about her. She was taken as a prototype for Albert Camus’s\nrévoltés and praised by André Gide as\n“the patron saint of all outsiders”. Giorgio Agamben\ndescribed her conscience as “the most lucid of our times”,\nand Hannah Arendt claimed that perhaps only Weil treated the subject\nof labor “without prejudice and sentimentality”. Maurice\nBlanchot described Weil as an “exceptional figure” who\noffers “an example of certitude” in the modern world, and\nIris Murdoch wrote of “a profoundly disciplined life behind her\nwritings” that gave “an authority which cannot be\nimitated”. But Weil was also criticized by Leon Trotsky as a\n“melancholy revolutionary” and disparaged as\n“crazy” by Charles de Gaulle. These remarks, however,\nbetray an irony of which Weil was well aware and about which she was\ndeeply concerned near the end of her life, namely, that her person\nwould be considered more than her thought. By categorically focusing\non the philosophical concepts Weil articulated and developed, this\nentry attempts to present her philosophy while speaking to her\nconcern.\n\n\nFollowing Weil’s philosophical development, her central concepts\nare addressed under five categories: social-political philosophy,\nepistemology, ethics, metaphysical and religious philosophy, and\naesthetics. The periodization employed is as follows: 1925–1934\n(early), 1935–1939 (middle), 1939–1943 (late). It is\nimportant to note that, given Weil’s rejection of systematicity\nand development of concepts, these categories and periods introduce a\ndegree of artifice into her thought. The conclusion of this entry\nreports on her reception among the Continental and Anglo-American\ntraditions of philosophy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimone Weil was born in Paris on 3 February 1909. Her parents, both of\nwhom came from Jewish families, provided her with an assimilated,\nsecular, bourgeois French childhood both cultured and comfortable.\nBoth Weil and her older brother André—himself a math\nprodigy, founder of the Bourbaki group, and a distinguished\nmathematician at the Princeton Institute for Advanced\nStudy—studied at prestigious Parisian schools. Weil’s\nfirst philosophy teacher, at the Lycée Victor-Duruy, was\nRené Le Senne; it was he who introduced her to the\nthesis—which she would maintain—that contradiction is a\ntheoretical obstacle generative of nuanced, alert thinking. Beginning\nin October 1925, Weil studied at Henri IV Lycée in preparation\nfor the entrance exams of the École Normale Supérieure.\nAt Henri IV she studied under the philosopher and essayist\nÉmile-Auguste Chartier (known pseudonymously as Alain), whose\nteacher was Jules Lageneau. Like Weil at this time, Alain was\nagnostic. In his classes he emphasized intellectual history: in\nphilosophy this included Plato, Marcus Aurelius, Descartes, Spinoza,\nand Kant, and in literature, Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and\nEuripides. Already sympathetic with the downtrodden and critical of\nFrench society, she gained the theoretical tools to levy critiques\nagainst her country and philosophical tradition in Alain’s\nclass. There, employing paradox and attention through the form of the\nessay (it is important to note that none of her writings was published\nas a book in her lifetime), she began intentionally developing what\nwould become her distinct mode of philosophizing. It is therefore\narguable that she is part of the Alain/Lagneau line of voluntarist,\nspiritueliste philosophy in France. \nIn 1928 Weil began her studies at the École Normale. She was\nthe only woman in her class, the first woman having been first\nadmitted in 1917. In 1929–1930 she worked on her dissertation on\nknowledge and perception in Descartes, and having received her\nagrégation diploma, she served from late 1931 to\nmid-1934 as a teacher at lycées. Throughout this\nperiod, outside of her duties at each lycée where she\ninstructed professionally, Weil taught philosophy to, lobbied for, and\nwrote on behalf of workers’ groups; at times, moreover, she\nherself joined in manual labor. In her early thinking she prized at\nonce the first-person perspective and radical skepticism of Descartes,\nthe class-based solidarity and materialist analysis of Marx, and the\nmoral absolutism and respect for the individual of Kant. Drawing from\neach, her early work can be read as an attempt to provide, with a view\ntoward liberty, her own analysis of the fundamental causes of\noppression in society. \nIn early August 1932, Weil travelled to Germany in order to understand\nbetter the conditions fostering Nazism. German trade unions, she wrote\nto friends upon her return to France, were the single force in Germany\nable to generate a revolution, but they were fully reformist. Long\nperiods of unemployment left many Germans without energy or esteem. At\nbest, she observed frankly, they could serve as a kind of dead weight\nin a revolution. More specifically, by early 1933 Weil criticized the\ntendency of social organizations to engender bureaucracy, which\nelevated management and collective thinking over and against the\nindividual worker. Against this tendency, she advocated for\nworkers’ understanding the physical labor they performed within\nthe context of the whole organizational apparatus. In\n“Reflections Concerning the Causes of Liberty and Social\nOppression” (1934), Weil presented both a summation of her early\nthought and a prefiguring of central elements in her thematic\ntrajectory. The essay employs a Marxian method of analysis that pays\nattention to the oppressed, critiques her own position as an\nintellectual, privileges manual labor, and demands precise and\nunorthodox individual thinking that unites theory and practice against\ncollective clichés, propaganda, obfuscation, and\nhyper-specialization. These ideas would provide a theoretical\nframework for her idiosyncratic practice of philosophy. Near the end\nof her life she wrote in a notebook: “Philosophy (including\nproblems of cognition, etc.) is exclusively an affair of\naction and practice” (FLN 362). \nOn 20 June, 1934, Weil applied for a sabbatical from teaching. She was\nto spend a year working in Parisian factories as part of its most\noppressed group, unskilled female laborers. Weil’s “year\nof factory work” (which amounted, in actuality, to around 24\nweeks of laboring) was not only important in the development of her\npolitical philosophy but can also be seen as a turning point in her\nslow religious evolution. \nIn Paris’s factories, Weil began to see and to comprehend\nfirsthand the normalization of brutality in modern industry. There,\nshe wrote in her “Factory Journal”, “[t]ime was an\nintolerable burden” (FW 225) as modern factory work comprised\ntwo elements principally: orders from superiors and, relatedly,\nincreased speeds of production. While the factory managers continued\nto demand more, both fatigue and thinking (itself less likely under\nsuch conditions) slowed work. As a result, Weil felt dehumanized.\nPhenomenologically, her factory experience was less one of physical\nsuffering per se, and more one of humiliation. Weil was\nsurprised that this humiliation produced not rebellion but rather\nfatigue, docility. She described her experience in factories as a kind\nof “slavery”. On a trip to Portugal in August 1935, upon\nwatching a procession to honor the patron saint of fishing villagers,\nshe had her first major contact with Christianity and wrote that  \nthe conviction was suddenly borne in upon [her] that Christianity is\npre-eminently the religion of slaves, that slaves cannot help\nbelonging to it, and [she] among others. (1942 “Spiritual\nAutobiography” in WFG 21–38, 26)  \nIn comparison with her pre-factory “Testament”, we see\nthat in her “Factory Journal” Weil maintains the language\nof liberty, but she moves terminologically from\n“oppression” to “humiliation” and\n“affliction”. Thus her conception and description of\nsuffering thickened and became more personal at this time. \nWeil participated in the 1936 Paris factory occupations and, moreover,\nplanned on returning to factory work. Her trajectory shifted, however,\nwith the advent of the Spanish Civil War. Critical of both civil and\ninternational war, on the level of geopolitics, she approved of\nFrance’s decision not to intervene on the Republican side. On\nthe level of individual commitment, however, she obtained\njournalist’s credentials and joined an international anarchist\nbrigade. On 20 August, 1936, Weil, clumsy and nearsighted, stepped in\na pot of boiling oil, severely burning her lower left leg and instep.\nOnly her parents could persuade her not to return to combat. By late\n1936 Weil wrote against French colonization of Indochina, and by early\n1937 she argued against French claims to Morocco and Tunisia. In April\n1937 she travelled to Italy. Within the basilica Santa Maria degli\nAngeli, inside the small twelfth-century Romanesque chapel where St.\nFrancis prayed, Weil had her second significant contact with\nChristianity. As she would later describe in a letter,\n“[S]omething stronger than I compelled me for the first time to\ngo down on my knees” (WFG 26). \nFrom 1937–1938 Weil revisited her Marxian commitments, arguing\nthat there is a central contradiction in Marx’s thought:\nalthough she adhered to his method of analysis and demonstration that\nthe modern state is inherently oppressive—being that it is\ncomposed of the army, police, and bureaucracy—she continued to\nreject any positing of revolution as immanent or determined. Indeed,\nin Weil’s middle period, Marx’s confidence in history\nseemed to her a worse ground for judgment than Machiavelli’s\nemphasis on contingency. \nDuring the week of Easter 1938, Weil visited the Benedictine abbey of\nSolesmes from Palm Sunday to the following Tuesday. At Solesmes she\nhad her third contact with Christianity: suffering from headaches,\nWeil found a joy so pure in Gregorian chant that, by analogy, she\ngained an understanding  \nof the possibility of living divine love in the midst of affliction.\nIt goes without saying that in the course of these services the\nthought of the passion of Christ entered into [her] being once and for\nall. (WFG 26)   \nAt Solesmes, she was also introduced to the seventeenth century\npoet George Herbert by a young Englishman she met there. She claimed\nto feel Christ’s presence while reciting Herbert’s poem\n“Love”. As she fixed her full attention on the poem while\nsuffering from her most intense headache, Weil came to see that her\nrecitation had the virtue of prayer, saying, “Christ himself\ncame down and took possession of me” (WFG 27). Importantly, she\nthought God “in his mercy” had prevented her from reading\nthe mystics until that point; therefore, she could not say that she\ninvented her unexpected contact with Christ (WFG 27). These events and\nwritings in 1936–1938 exemplify the mutually informing nature of\nsolidarity and spirituality in Weil’s thought that began in\nAugust 1935. \nAfter the military alliance of Germany and Italy in May 1939, Weil\nrenounced her pacifism. It was not that she felt she was wrong in holding\nsuch a position before, but now, she argued, France was no longer\nstrong enough to remain generous or merely defensive. Following the\nGerman Western offensive, she left Paris with her family in June 1940,\non the last train. They settled eventually but temporarily in\nMarseilles, at the time the main gathering point for those attempting\nto flee France, and where Weil would work with the Resistance. \nIn Vichy France Weil took up a practice she had long sought, namely,\nto apprentice herself to the life of agricultural laborers. In\naddition, in Marseilles she was introduced to the Dominican priest\nJoseph-Marie Perrin, who became a close friend as well as a spiritual\ninterlocutor, and through whom she began to consider the question of\nbaptism. In an effort to help Weil find a job as an agricultural\nlaborer, Perrin turned to his friend Gustave Thibon, a Catholic writer\nwho owned a farm in the Ardéche region. Thus in Fall 1941 Weil\nworked in the grape harvest. Importantly, however, she was not treated\nlike the rest of the laborers; although she worked a full eight hours\nper day, she resided and ate at the house of her employers. It is said\nthat she carried Plato’s Symposium with her in the\nvineyards and attempted to teach the text to her fellow laborers. \nIn 1942 Weil agreed to leave France in part so her parents would be in\na safe place (they would not leave without her, she knew), but\nprincipally because she thought she might be more useful for\nFrance’s war effort if she were in another country. Thus she\nwent to New York via Morocco. In New York, as in Marseilles, she\nfilled notebook after notebook with philosophical, theological, and\nmathematical considerations. New York, however, felt removed from the\nsufferings of her native France; the Free French movement in London\nfelt one step closer to returning to France. In 1943 Weil was given a\nsmall office at 19 Hill Street in London. From this room she would\nwrite day and night for the next four months, sleeping around three\nhours each night. Her output in this period totaled around 800 printed\npages, but she resigned from the Free French movement in late July\n(Pétrement 1973 [1976: xx]). \nWeil died Tuesday, 24 August 1943. Three days later, the coroner\npronounced her death a suicide—cardiac failure from\nself-starvation and tuberculosis. The accounts provided by her\nbiographers tell a more complex story: Weil was aware that her fellow\ncountry-men and women in the occupied territory had to live on minimal\nfood rations at this time, and she had insisted on the same for\nherself, which exacerbated her physical illness (Von der Ruhr 2006:\n18). On 30 August she was buried at Ashford’s New Cemetery\nbetween the Jewish and the Catholic sections. Her grave was originally\nanonymous. For fifteen years Ashford residents thought it was a\npauper’s. \nAlways writing from the left, Weil continually revised her\nsocial-political philosophy in light of the rapidly changing material\nconditions in which she lived. However, she was consistent in her\nacute attention to and theorizing from the situation of the oppressed\nand marginalized in society. \nHer early essays on politics, a number of which were posthumously\ncollected by Albert Camus in Oppression et liberté\n(OL), include “Capital and the Worker” (1932),\n“Prospects: Are We Heading for the Proletarian\nRevolution?” (1933), “Reflections concerning Technology,\nNational Socialism, the U.S.S.R., and certain other matters”\n(1933) and, most importantly, “Reflections concerning the Causes\nof Liberty and Social Oppression” (1934 in OL 36–117). In\nher early writings, Weil attempted to provide an analysis of the real\ncauses of oppression so as to inform militants in revolutionary\naction. Her concern was that, without this analysis, a socially\nenticing movement would lead only to superficial changes in the\nappearance of the means of production, not to new forms of structural\norganization. \nThe division of labor or the existence of material privilege alone is\nnot a sufficient condition for Weil’s concept of\n“oppression”. That is, she recognized that there are some\nforms of social relations involving deference, hierarchy, and order\nthat are not necessarily oppressive. However, the intervention of the\nstruggle for power—which she, following Hobbes, sees as an\ninexorable feature of human society—generates oppression. \n[P]ower [puissance] contains a sort of fatality which weighs\nas pitilessly on those who command as on those who obey; nay more, it\nis in so far as it enslaves the former that, through their agency, it\npresses down upon the latter (“Reflections concerning the Causes\nof Liberty and Social Oppression”, OL 62). \nOppression, then, is a specific social organization that, as a\nconsequence of the essentially unstable struggle for power, and\nprincipally the structure of labor, limits the individual from\nexperiencing the world to the full extent of her or his full\ncapability, a capability Weil describes as “methodical\nthinking” (pénsee méthodique). By\ndivorcing the understanding from the application of a method,\noppression, exercised through force, denies human beings direct\ncontact with reality. Also informing her sense of oppression is her\nnotion of “privilege”, which includes not only money or\narms, but also a corpus of knowledge closed to the working masses\nthat, thereby, engenders a culture of specialists. Privilege thus\nexacerbates oppression in modern societies, which are held together\nnot by shared goals, meaningful relations, or organically developing\ncommunities, but through a “religion of power” (OL 69). In\nthis way, both power and prestige contribute to a modern reversal of\nmeans and ends. That is, elements like money, technology, and\nwar—all properly speaking “means”—are, through\nthe workings of power, treated as “ends” worthy of\nfurtherance, enhancement, and multiplication without limit. \nIn her early social-political thought Weil testified to what she\ncalled “a new species of oppression”\n(“Prospects”, OL 9), namely, the bureaucracy of modern\nindustry. Both her anarchism and Marxian method of analysis influenced\nhow she problematized revolutionary struggle: the problem lies in\nforming a social organization that does not engender bureaucracy, an\nanonymous and institutionalized manifestation of force. The oppression\nof modern bureaucracy, to which she responded through analysis and\ncritique, includes clichéd, official and obscurantist language,\nprofessionalization—the “caste privileges” of\nintellectuals (“Technology, National Socialism, the\nU.S.S.R”, OL 34)— and a division of labor such that, in\nthe case of most workers, labor does not involve, but in fact\nprecludes, engaged thinking. Out of balance in this way, modern humans\nlive as cogs in a machine: less like thinking individuals, and more\nlike instruments crushed by “collectivities”.\nCollectivity—a concept that centrally comprises industry,\nbureaucracy, and the state (the “bureaucratic organization\npar excellence” [OL 109]), but that also includes\npolitical parties, churches, and unions—by definition quashes\nindividual subjectivity. \nDespite her critiques of oppression, prestige, and collectivity, in a\npolemical argument Weil is also critical of “revolution”,\nwhich for her refers to an inversion of forces, the victory of the\nweak over the powerful. This, she says, is “the equivalent of a\nbalance whose lighter scale were to go down” (OL 74).\n“Revolution” in its colloquial or deterministic sense,\nthen, has itself become an “opiate”, a word for which the\nlaboring masses die, but which lies empty. For Weil, real revolution\nis precisely the re-organization of labor such that it subordinates\nthe laborers neither to management (as in bureaucracy) nor to\noppressive conditions (as in factory work). As she sees it, if\nrevolution is to have meaning, it is only as a regulative, and not a\npositive, ideal (OL 53). In Weil’s adaptation of this Kantian\nnotion, such a regulative ideal involves an attention to reality,\ne.g., to the present political and working conditions, to human\nconditions such as the struggle for power. Only thus can it provide a\nstandard of analysis for action: the ideal allows for a dialectical\nrelation between a revolutionary alternative and present praxis, which\nis always grounded in material conditions. Freedom, then, is a unity\nof thought and action. It is, moreover—and not unlike in\nHegel’s conceptualization—a condition of balanced\nrelations to and dependence on both others (who check our autonomy)\nand the world (which is limited and limiting). A freeing mode of\nproduction, as opposed to an alienating and oppressing one, would\ninvolve a relation to thinking and to others throughout the course of\nlabor. When workers understand both the mechanical procedures and the\nefforts of other members of the collectivity, the collectivity itself\nbecomes subject to individuals, i.e., means and ends are rightfully in\na relation of equilibrium. \nThe ontology behind Weil’s notion of free labor draws on the\nKantian emphasis on the individual as an end—especially, for\nWeil, in her or his capacity for thinking (with Plato, for whom\nknowing and doing are united). In addition, the teleology of labor in\nWeil’s philosophy corresponds with the thought of Hegel and\nMarx, and is in opposition to Locke: in the individual’s mixing\nwith the material world, her interest lies in how this promotes\nliberty, rather than property. The uprooting Weil experienced in\nfactory work introduced a shift in her conception of freedom: as she\nbegan to see the human condition as not just one of inexorable\nstruggle, but of slavery, her notion of freedom shifted from a\nnegative freedom from constraints to a positive freedom to obey. She\nreferred to the latter, a particular kind of relational freedom, as\n“consent”. She concluded her “inventory of modern\ncivilization” (OL 116) with a call to introduce play into the\nbureaucratic machine and a call to think as individuals, denying the\n“social idol” by “refusing to subordinate\none’s own destiny to the course of history” and by taking\nup “critical analysis” (OL 117). In sum, by 1934 Weil\npictured an ideal society, which she conceptualized as a regulative\nimpossibility in which manual labor, understood and performed by\nthinking individuals, was a “pivot” toward liberty. \nWeil’s “Factory Journal” from 1934–1935\nsuggests a shift in her social-political philosophy. During this\nperiod, her political pessimism deepened. In light of the humiliating\nwork she conducted in the factories, her post-factory writings feature\na terminological intensification: from “humiliation” and\n“oppression” to “affliction”\n(malheur), a concept informed by her factory experience of\nembodied pain combined with psychological agony and social\ndegradation—and to which she would later add spiritual\ndistress. \nIn 1936 Weil advanced her political commitments in ways that\nforeshadowed her later social-political thought. She continued to\neschew revolution and instead to work toward reform, namely, greater\nequality in the factory through a shift from a structure of\nsubordination to one of collaboration. In addition, in response to the\noutbreak of the Spanish Civil War, she argued against fascism while\nfavoring—against the Communist position—French\nnon-intervention. She was opposed to authoritarian logic, and she saw\ngoing to war as a kind of surrender to the logic of power and prestige\ninherent in fascism.  \nOne must choose between prestige and peace. And whether one claims to\nbelieve in the fatherland, democracy, or revolution, the policy of\nprestige means war. (1936 “Do We Have to Grease Our Combat\nBoots”, FW 258) \nWeil’s development of the concepts of power and prestige\ncontinued in her article “Let Us Not Start Another Trojan\nWar” (1936, subtitled, and translated into English as,\n“The Power of Words” in SWA 238–258). Her thesis is\nthat a war’s destruction is inversely proportional to the\nofficial pretexts given for fighting it. Wars are absurd, she argued\n(against Clausewitz), because “they are conflicts with no\ndefinable objective” (SWA 239). Like the phantom of Helen\nthat inspired ten years of fighting, ideologies (e.g., capitalism,\nsocialism, fascism), as well as capitalized words such as\n“Nation” and “State”, have taken on the role\nof the phantom in the modern world. Power relies on\nprestige—itself illusory and without limit because no nation\nthinks it has enough or is sure of maintaining its imagined glory, and\nin response ever increases its means to wage war—so as to appear\nabsolute and invincible. In response to these forces, Weil prescribed\ndistinguishing between the imaginary and the real and, relatedly,\ndefining words properly and precisely. Taken together, these\nprescriptions amount to a critique of ideology and political rhetoric\n(a critique Weil articulated more fully in her later writings). \n[W]hen a word is properly defined it loses its capital letter and can\nno longer serve either as a banner or as a hostile slogan; it becomes\nsimply a sign, helping us to grasp some concrete reality or concrete\nobjective, or method of activity. To clarify thought, to discredit the\nintrinsically meaningless words, and to define the use of others by\nprecise analysis—to do this, strange though it may appear, might\nbe a way of saving human lives. (SWA 242) \nFurther, Weil desired a kind of equilibrium, a balance between forces\ninstead of an endless pursuit of an illusion of absolute stability.\nFollowing Heraclitus, she saw struggle as a condition of life. What is\nrequired of the thinking individual, in turn, is to distinguish\nbetween worthwhile conflict, such as class struggle, and illusions of\nprestige, such as war. In her middle period, then, Weil maintained the\ncontrariety between reality, limit, and equilibrium on the one hand\nand imagination, limitlessness, and collectivity on the other. In her\n1937 “Note on Social Democracy”, she defined politics as\nfollows: \nThe material of the political art is the double perspective, ever\nshifting between the real conditions of social equilibrium and the\nmovements of collective imagination. Collective imagination, whether\nof mass meetings or of meetings in evening dress, is never correctly\nrelated to the really decisive factors of a given social situation; it\nis always beside the point, or ahead of it, or behind it. (SE 152) \nIn her late period Weil provided an explication of the all-pervasive,\nindeed indiscriminate, concept of “force” in the essay\n“The Iliad or the Poem of Force” (1940 in SWA\n182–215). It is important to note Weil’s locus of\nenunciation for this concept, temporally after the fall of France\nand spatially from a position of exile, including antisemitic\nmarginalization, which is why the essay appeared in the December 1940\nand January 1941 Cahiers du Sud under the anagrammatic\npseudonym Emile Novis, taken up by Weil to avoid antisemitic\nconfrontation and censorship. This essay was not only the most widely\nread of Weil’s pieces during her lifetime, but it was also her\nfirst essay to appear in English, translated by Mary McCarthy and\npublished in Dwight Macdonald’s magazine Politics in 1945\n(November, pp. 321–330). \nIn her essay on the Iliad—a text Roberto Esposito calls\n“a phenomenology of force” (Esposito 1996 [2017:\n46])—Weil further develops an understanding of force initially\npresented in her earlier, unfinished essay “Reflections on\nBarbarism” (1939): “I believe that the concept of force\nmust be made central in any attempt to think clearly about human\nrelations” (quoted in Pétrement 1973 [1976: 361]). The\nprotagonist of the Iliad, Weil writes in an original reading,\nis not Achilles or Hector, but force itself. Like her concept of\n“power” in her early writings, “force” reifies\nand dehumanizes no matter if one wields or undergoes it. Further,\nforce includes not only coercion, but also prestige, which is to say\nthat it has a social element. Two important implications follow.\nFirst, on the level of the individual, each “personality”\n(la personne) is informed by social values and thereby\nfeatures the operations of force through accidental characteristics,\nsuch as the name of the family into which one is born or the embodied\nfeatures that are considered physically attractive at a certain place,\nin a certain society, at a certain time. Second, on the level of the\ncollectivity, force can destroy not only bodies, but also values and\ncultures, as is the case, Weil is at pains to point out, in French\ncolonialism. In her mid-to-late writings, then, Weil saw neither\nMarx’s notion of class nor Hegel’s self-development of\nGeist, but force itself, as the key to history. She presents\nthis concept as twofold: as, “in its grossest and most summary\nform”, “the force that kills”, and, more\nunpredictably in its effects, as a specific kind of violence\n“that does not kill just yet”, though  \n[i]t will surely kill, it will possibly kill, or perhaps it merely\nhangs, poised and ready, over the head of the creature it can\nkill, at any moment, which is to say at every moment. (SWA\n184–185)  \nWeil’s concept of force, then, is also a development from Hobbes\nand Hegel: it names that which renders the individual a slave. \nIt was in London (1942–1943), during her work for the Free\nFrench, that Weil articulated her most robust late social-political\nphilosophy. Her concepts of “labor” and\n“justice” thickened as she moved further toward\nChristianity and—against her early emphasis on the\nindividual—toward the social. Weil’s pièces\nd’occasion from this time period include “Draft for a\nStatement of Human Obligations” (1943), written in response to\nde Gaulle’s State Reform Commission in its drafting of a new\nDeclaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, as well as “Note\non the General Suppression of Political Parties” (1943), written\nbecause the Free French was considering recognizing political parties.\nIn this piece Weil argues for the complete abolition of political\nparties. Drawing on Rousseau’s concept of the general will, Weil\ncontends that political parties subdue the independent, individual\nwills of which the general will is derivative and on which democracy\ndepends. Most important from this period was her major work The\nNeed for Roots (L’enracinement), which Weil called\nher second “magnum opus” (SL 186), and which Albert Camus\npublished posthumously in 1949, with Gallimard, as the first of 11\nvolumes of Weil’s he would promote. \nWeil wrote additional essays in London, the most conceptually\nimportant of which was “La Personne et le\nsacré” (1942–1943, translated into English as\n“Human Personality”), in which she critiques\n“rights” as reliant on force and poses as counter-terms\n“obligation” and “justice”. She distinguishes\nbetween two conceptions of justice: natural (hence social and\ncontingent) and supernatural (hence impersonal and eternal). The\nNeed for Roots (1943 NR) adds “needs of the soul” as\nanother counter-balance to rights. Overall, Weil presents not a\nlaw-based or rights-based, but a compassion-based morality, involving\nobligations to another that are discernible through attention,\ncentered on and evolving toward a supernatural justice that is not of\nthe world, but that can be in it. As a departure from Kant, and\nthrough Plato, whom Weil “came to feel… was a\nmystic” (“Spiritual Autobiography”, WFG 28), the\nbasis of her sense of (supernatural) justice was not human\nrationality, but a desire for the Good, which she believed all humans\nshare, even if at times they forget or deny this. Importantly, given\nher critique of French colonialism, and despite her claim that\nobligations to another must be indiscriminate, i.e., universal, she\ndid not want to universalize law in a Kantian fashion. Rather, her aim\nwas for cultures to continue their own traditions, for the goal of\nrootedness (l’enracinement) is not to change cultural\nvalues per se, but more precisely, to change how individuals\nin those cultures read and orient themselves toward those values. \nWeil’s concept of “roots” is crucial to her late\npolitical thought. With connotations of both vitality and\nvulnerability, “roots” conceptualizes human society as\ndynamic and living while attesting to the necessity of stability and\nsecurity if growth and flourishing are to occur on the level of the\nindividual. Beyond the organic metaphor on the level of the natural,\nher concept of roots serves as a kind of bridge between the reality of\nsociety and the ideal of supernatural justice. Roots do this by\nmanifesting human subjection to material and historical conditions,\nincluding the need to participate in the life of a community, to feel\na sense of connection to a place, and to maintain temporal links,\ne.g., to cultural history and to hopes for the future. In turn, a\nrooted community allows for the development of the individual with a\nview toward God or eternal values. As such, and contra her\nearly and middle maintenance of a critical distance from any\ncollectivity (any Great Beast, to use the Platonic metaphor she\nfrequently employs), in her late thought Weil sees roots as allowing\nfor a “new patriotism” based on compassion. The\nestablishing of roots (l’enracinement) enables multiple\nrelations to the world (e.g., on the level of the nation, the\norganically developing community, the school) that at once nourish the\nindividual and the community. \nIn addition to war and colonization, in The Need for Roots\nWeil points to money and to contemporary education as\nself-perpetuating forces that uproot human life. The longest section\nof the text describes modern uprootedness\n(déracinement), occurring when the imagined modern\nnation and money are the only binding forces in society, and she\ncharacterizes this condition as a threat to the human soul. Modern\neducation is corrupted both by capitalism—such that it is\nnothing except “a machine for producing diplomas, in other\nwords, jobs” (NR 118)—and by a Roman inheritance for\ncultivating prestige with respect to the nation: “It is this\nidolatry of self which they have bequeathed to us in the form of\npatriotism” (NR 137). As an alternative to modern uprootedness,\nWeil presents a civilization based not on force, which turns a person\ninto a thing, but on free labor, which in its engagement with and\nconsent to necessary forces at play in the world, including time and\ndeath, allows for direct contact with reality. Moreover, Weil’s\nwriting in The Need for Roots is refracted through her\nreligious experience. In this later period, then, she no longer\nconceptualizes labor in the mechanical terms of a “pivot”\nas she did in her early writings; it is now the “spiritual\ncore” of “a well-ordered social life” (NR 295). (In\nher late social-political philosophy, in fact, a spiritual revolution\nis more important than an economic one.) Contra the Greeks,\nwho devalued physical work, her conception of labor serves to mediate\nbetween the natural and the supernatural. In her late writings, labor\nis fully inflected by her faith in light of her experiences with\nChristianity. As such, labor’s consent to and, moreover, working\nthrough natural forces (e.g., gravity) is in fact consent to God, who\ncreated the natural world. Labor’s kenotic activity, as energy\nis expended daily, is a kind of imitatio Christi. \nHer social-political writings in London are markedly different from\nher early writings as an anarchist informed principally by Descartes,\nMarx, and Kant. While those influences remain, her later writings must\nbe read through the lens of her Christian Platonism. She suggests that\nwe must draw our spiritual life from our social environment. That is,\nwhile spirituality is individual vis-à-vis God, this\nspirituality occurs within a social context, namely, the collectivity,\nand principally, the nation. This is a reversal from the critical\ndistance she had maintained from the collectivity, especially in her\nearly emphasis on the individual’s methodical thinking. \nThroughout her life, Weil argued that knowledge in and of the world\ndemanded rigorous, balanced thinking, even if that difficulty and\nmeasurement led the thinker to near-impossible tasks. For her these\ntasks of thinking included, for instance, her attempting to synthesize\nperspectives of intricate Catholic doctrine on the threshold of the\nChurch with wisdom from various traditions such as ancient Greek\nphilosophy and tragedies, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism. Following\nAeschylus, she believed knowledge was gained through suffering. Shaped\nby her social-political and religious thought, Weil’s\nepistemology would change over time, especially in light of her\nmystical experiences, of her first-person contacts with God. \nIn her dissertation, Weil attempts to think with Descartes in order to\nfind foundational knowledge. Like Descartes, she argues for the\nexistence of self, God, and world. Her cogito, however, was a\ndecisive break from his: “I can, therefore I am” (Je\npuis, donc je suis) (1929–1930 “Science and\nPerception in Descartes”, FW 59). The self has the power of\nfreedom, Weil argues, but something else—the omnipotent,\nGod—makes the self realize that it is not all-powerful.\nSelf-knowledge, then, is capability always qualified by the\nacknowledgment that one is not God. She maintained a kind of Cartesian\nepistemology during her time as a teacher, early in her academic life.\nIn Lectures on Philosophy (1978 LP), a collection of lecture\nnotes taken by one of her students during the academic year\n1933–1934 at a girl’s lycée in Roanne, we\nfind that Weil is initially critical of sensations as grounds for\nknowledge, and thereby critical of empiricist epistemology (LP\n43–47). \nFrom her early writings onward she was to problematize the imagination\nas the “folle imagination”, a barrier between\nmind and reality, meaning that the human knower is kept from\nthings-in-themselves. Weil’s epistemology, then, informed by her\ninitial studies of Descartes, would take on inflections of Kant and\nPlato while positioning her against Aristotle. She was critical of any\nsensation that universalizes one’s reading of the world, and she\nsaw the imagination as thus extending the self, because it could not\nhelp but think through its own categories, wishes, and desires,\nthereby reading the world on its own terms. Relatedly, Weil would\ndevelop an intersubjective epistemology. Knowing the truth requires\nnot extending one’s own limited perspective, but suspending or\nabandoning it such that reality—including the reality of the\nexistence of others—could appear on its own terms. This\nsuspension involves a practice of epistemic humility and openness to\nall ideas; intelligence for Weil demands the qualified use of\nlanguage, acknowledgement of degrees, proportions, contingencies, and\nrelations, as well as an ability to call the self into question. These\nepistemic practices are part of a broader recognition that the\nindividual knower is limited. \nThe progression of Weil’s epistemology can be seen first in her\nconceptualization of contradiction. By Lectures on\nPhilosophy, she affirmed a sense of contradiction beyond the\nlogical conjunction “a is b” and\n“a is not-b”. Indeed, she argues that\ncontradiction can be a generative obstacle in that it requires the\nmind to expand its thinking in order to transcend the obstacle.\nDrawing on the mathematics of Eudoxus, she elaborates on this notion\nto claim that incommensurables can be reconciled when set on a kind of\n“higher plane”. This is not, however, a type of Hegelian\nsynthesis that can be intellectually apprehended. Instead, the\ncontemplation of contradictions can lead the knower to a higher\ncontemplation of truth-as-mystery. Thus, in her late epistemology Weil\npresents this concept of “mystery” as a certain kind of\ncontradiction in which incommensurables appear linked in an\nincomprehensible unity. \nMystery, as a conceptualization of contradiction, carries theological,\nor at least supernatural, implications. For instance, if contradiction\nis understood through formal logic, then the existence of affliction\nwould seemingly prove the nonexistence of an omnipotent, wholly\nbenevolent God; however, contradiction, understood as mystery, can\nitself serve as a mediation, allowing for the coexistence of\naffliction and God, seen most prominently on the Cross. Indeed, Christ\nis the religious solution to Weil’s principal contradiction,\nthat between the necessary and the good. Moreover, through incarnation\nthat opens onto universality, Christ also manifests and solves the\ncontradiction of the individual and the collectivity. Thus, in a\nmodification of the Pythagorean idea of harmony, she claims that\nChrist allows for “the just balance of contraries”\n(“Spiritual Autobiography”, WFG 33). More broadly, in her\n1941 “The Pythagorean Doctrine”, she argues that\nmathematics are a bridge between the natural and eternal (or between\nhumans and God). That is, the Pythagoreans held an intellectual\nsolution to apparent natural contradictions. Inspired by Pythagoras,\nshe claimed that the very study of mathematics can be a means of\npurification if light of the principles of proportion and the\nnecessary balancing of contraries—especially in geometry. She\nsaw in the Pythagorean legacy and spirit a link between their\nmathematical insights and their distinctly religious project to\npenetrate the mysteries of the cosmos. \nAs opposed to the suppression or dissolution of contradictions, as in\nsystematic philosophy, in Weil’s value-centered philosophy\ncontradictions are to be presented honestly and tested on different\nlevels; for her, they are “the criterion of the real” and\ncorrespond with the orientation of detachment (GG 98). For example,\nChrist’s imperative to “love your enemies” contains\na contradiction in value: love those who are detestable and who\nthreaten the vulnerability of loving. For Weil, submitting to this\nunion of contraries loosens one’s attachments to particular,\nego-driven perspectives and enables a “well-developed\nintellectual pluralism” (Springsted 2010: 97). She writes,\n“An attachment to a particular thing can only be destroyed by an\nattachment which is incompatible with it” (GG 101). With these\nphilosophical moves in mind, Robert Chenavier argues that she has not\na philosophy of perception, a phenomenology, but rather, borrowing\nGaston Bachelard’s phrase, a “dynamology of\ncontradiction” (Chenavier 2009 [2012: 25]). \nOverall, Weil’s presentation of contradiction is more\nPythagorean or Platonic than it is Marxian: it takes up contradiction\nnot through resolution on the level of things, but through dialectics\non the level of thought, where mystery is the beginning and end-point\nof thought (Springsted 2010: 97). In her unfinished essay “Is\nThere a Marxist Doctrine?”, from her time in London, Weil\nwrites,  \nContradiction in matter is imaged by the clash of forces coming from\ndifferent directions. Marx purely and simply attributed to social\nmatter this movement towards the good through contradictions, which\nPlato described as being that of the thinking creature drawn upwards\nby the supernatural operation of grace. (OL 180)  \nShe follows the Greek usage of “dialectics” to consider\n“the virtue of contradiction as support for the soul drawn\nupwards by grace”; Marx errs, she thought, in coupling such a\nmovement with “materialism” (OL 181). \nA second central epistemological concept for Weil is\n“reading” (lecture). Reading is a kind\nof interpretation of what is presented to knowers by both their\nphysical sensations and their social conditions; therefore,\nreading—as the reception and attribution of certain meanings in\nthe world—is always mediated. In turn, readings are mediated\nthrough other readings, since our perception of meaning is undoubtedly\ninvolved in and affected by an intersubjective web of interpretations.\nWeil explains this through the metaphor, borrowed from Descartes, of a\nblind man’s stick. We can read a situation through attention to\nanother in order to expand our awareness and sensitivity, just as the\nblind man enlarges his sensibility through the use of his stick. But\nour readings of the world can also become more narrow and simplistic,\nas for instance, when a context of violence and force tempts us to see\neveryone we encounter as a potential threat. Moreover, readings are\nnot free from power dynamics and can become projects of imposition and\nintervention; here her epistemology connects to her social-political\nphilosophy, specifically to her concept of force.  \nWe read, but also we are read by, others. Interferences in these\nreadings. Forcing someone to read himself as we read him (slavery).\nForcing others to read us as we read ourselves (conquest). (NB 43)\n \nShe connects reading to war and imagination: “War is a way of\nimposing another reading of sensations, a pressure upon the\nimagination of others” (NB 24). In her 1941 “Essay on the\nConcept of Reading” (LPW 21–27) Weil elaborates,\n“War, politics, eloquence, art, teaching, all action on others\nessentially consists in changing what they read” (LPW 26). In\nthe same essay she develops “reading” in relation to the\naforementioned epistemological concepts of appearance, the empirical\nworld, and contradiction: \n[A]t each instant of our life we are gripped from the outside, as it\nwere, by meanings that we ourselves read in appearances. That is why\nwe can argue endlessly about the reality of the external world, since\nwhat we call the world are the meanings that we read; they are not\nreal. But they seize us as if they were external; that is real. Why\nshould we try to resolve this contradiction when the more important\ntask of thought in this world is to define and contemplate insoluble\ncontradictions, which, as Plato said, draw us upwards? (LPW 22) \nIt is important to note that for Weil, we are not simply passive in\nour readings. That is, we can learn to change our readings of the\nworld or of others. An elevated transformation in reading, however,\ndemands an apprenticeship in loving God through the things of this\nworld—a kind of attentiveness that will also entail certain\nbodily involvements, labors, postures, and experiences. Particular\nreadings result from particular ways of living. Ideally for her, we\nwould read the natural as illuminated by the supernatural. This\nconceptualization of reading involves recognition on hierarchical\nlevels, as she explains in her notebooks:  \nTo read necessity behind sensation, to read order behind necessity, to\nread God behind order. We must love all facts, not for their\nconsequences, but because in each fact God is there present. But that\nis tautological. To love all facts is nothing else than to read God in\nthem. (NB 267)  \nThus the world is known as a kind of text featuring several\nsignifications on several stages, levels, or domains. \nWeil’s epistemology grounds her critique of modern science. In\nThe Need for Roots she advocates for a science conducted\n“according to methods of mathematical precision, and at the same\ntime maintained in close relationship with religious faith” (NR\n288). Through contemplation of the natural world via this kind of\nscience, the world could be read on multiple levels. The knower,\nreading thus, would understand that the order of the world is the same\nas a unity, but different on its myriad levels:  \nwith respect to God [it] is eternal Wisdom; with respect to the\nuniverse, perfect obedience; with respect to our love, beauty; with\nrespect to our intelligence, balance of necessary relations; with\nrespect to our flesh, brute force. (NR 288–289)  \nAs in her social-political thought, in her epistemology Weil is a kind\nof anti-modern. She sees modern science and epistemology as a project\nof self-expansion that forgets limit and thinks the world should be\nsubject to human power and autonomy. Labor (especially physical labor,\nsuch as farming), then, also assumes an epistemological role for her.\nBy heteronomously subjecting the individual to necessity on a daily\nbasis, it at once contradicts self-aggrandizement and allows for a\nmore balanced reading: the intelligence qualifies itself as it reads\nnecessary relations simultaneously on multiple levels. This reading on\ndifferent levels, and inflected through faith, amounts to a kind of\nnon-reading, in that it is detached, impersonal and impartial. Through\nthese predicates “reading” is connected to her social\nthought, aesthetics, and religious philosophy. That is, in her later\nthought Weil’s epistemology relies on a time-out-of-mind\nmetaphysics for justification. Analogous to aesthetic taste, spiritual\ndiscernment—God-given and graceful—allows the abdicated\nself to read from a universal perspective at its most developed stage.\nThus, she argued, one can love equally and indiscriminately, just as\nthe sun shines or the rain falls without preference. \nWeil’s central ethical concept is “attention”\n(l’attention), which, though thematically and\npractically present in her early writings, reached its robust\ntheoretical expression while she was in Marseilles in 1942. Attention\nis a particular kind of ethical “turn” in her\nconceptualization. Fundamentally, it is less a moral position or\nspecific practice and more an orientation that nevertheless requires\nan arduous apprenticeship leading to a capacity of discernment on\nmultiple levels. This includes discerning what someone is going\nthrough in her or his suffering, the particular protest made by\nsomeone harmed, the social conditions that engender a climate for\nsuffering, and the fact that one is, by chance (hazard) at a\ndifferent moment, equally a subject of affliction. Attention is\ndirected not by will but by a particular kind of desire without an\nobject. It is not a “muscular effort” but a\n“negative effort” (WFG 61), involving release of egoistic\nprojects and desires and a growing receptivity of the mind. For Weil,\nas a Christian Platonist, the desire motivating attention is oriented\ntoward the mysterious good that “draws God down” (WFG 61).\nIn her essay “Reflections on the Right use of School Studies\nwith a View to the Love of God” (1942 in WFG 57–65), Weil\ntakes prayer, defined as “the orientation of all the attention\nof which the soul is capable toward God”, as her point of\ndeparture (WFG 57). She then describes a kind of vigilance in her\ndefinition of attention: \nAttention consists of suspending our thought, leaving it detached\n[disponible], empty [vide], and ready to be\npenetrated by the object; it means holding in our minds, within the\nreach of this thought, but on the lower level and not in contact with\nit, the diverse knowledge we have acquired which we are forced to make\nuse of. … Above all our thought should be empty\n[vide], waiting [en attente], not seeking anything\n[ne rien chercher], but ready to receive in its naked truth\nthe object that is to penetrate it. (WFG 62) \nThe French makes more clear the connection between attention\n(l’attention) and waiting (attente). For Weil\nthe problem with searching, instead of waiting en hupomene\n(δἰ ὑπομονῆς),\nis precisely that one is eager to fill the void characterizing\nattente. As a result, one settles too quickly on some-thing:\na counterfeit, falsity, idol. Because in searching or willing the\nimagination fills the void (le vide), it is crucial that\nattention be characterized by suspension and detachment. Indeed, the\nvoid by definition is empty (vide)—of idols, futural\nself-projections, consolations that compensate un-thinking, and\nattachments of collective and personal prestige. As such, its\nacceptance marks individual fragility and destructibility, that is,\nmortality. But this acceptance of death is the condition for the\npossibility of the reception of grace. (As explained below in regard\nto her religious philosophy, Weil’s concept for the disposition\ncharacterized by these features of attention, with obvious theological\nresonances, is “decreation”.) \nIn attention one renounces one’s ego in order to receive the\nworld without the interference of one’s limited and consumptive\nperspective. This posture of self-emptying, a stripping away of the\n“I” (dépouillement)—ultimately for\nWeil an imitatio Christi in its kenosis—allows for an\nimpersonal but intersubjective ethics. Indeed, if the primary\norientation of attention is toward a mysterious and unknown God (often\nexperienced as a desire for the Good), the secondary disposition is\ntoward another person, especially toward those going through\naffliction.  \nThe soul empties itself [se vide] of all its own contents in\norder to receive into itself the being it is looking at, just as he\nis, in all his truth. Only he who is capable of attention can do this.\n(WFG 65) \nWeil recognizes and problematizes the fact that the autonomous self\nnaturally imposes itself in its projects, as opposed to disposing\nitself to the other; for this reason, attention is rare but is\nrequired of any ethical disposition. The exemplary story of attention\nfor Weil is the parable of the Good Samaritan, in which, on her\nreading, compassion is exchanged when one individual “turns his\nattention toward” another individual, anonymous and afflicted\n(WFG 90). \nThe actions that follow are just the automatic effect of this moment\nof attention. The attention is creative. But at the moment when it is\nengaged it is a renunciation. This is true, at least, if it is pure.\nThe man accepts to be diminished by concentrating on an expenditure of\nenergy, which will not extend his own power but will only give\nexistence to a being other than himself, who will exist independently\nof him. (1942 “Forms of the Implicit Love of God” in WFG\n83–142, 90) \nAs such, attention not only gives human recognition and therefore\nmeaningful existence to another, but it also allows the individual\nengaged in renunciation to take up a moral stance in response to her\nor his desire for good. \nIt is important to distinguish Weil’s ethics of attention from\ncanonical conceptualizations of ethics. Attention is not motivated by\na duty (although Weil thinks we are obligated to respond to\nothers’ needs, whether of soul or body [see “Draft for a\nStatement of Human Obligations” in SWA, esp. 224–225]) or\nassessed by its consequences. In addition, through its sense of\nphronesis (practical wisdom), which Weil assumed from\nAristotle through Marx, attention is arguably closer to virtue ethics\nthan it is to deontology or consequentialism. However, it is separated\nfrom the tradition of virtue ethics in important ways: it often\nemerges more spontaneously than virtue, which, for Aristotle, is\ncultivated through habituation as it develops into a hexis;\nits emphasis on a “negative effort” suggests an\nactive-passive orientation that militates against Aristotle’s\nemphasis on activity (it is more a “turning” than a\n“doing”, more orientation than achievement); it is\nexcessive in its generosity, as opposed to being a mean,\ne.g., liberality; its supernatural inspiration contrasts with\nAristotle’s naturalism; it does not imply a teleology of\nrealizing one’s own virtuous projects—in fact, it is a\nsuspension of one’s own projects; finally, for Weil, Aristotle\nlacks a sense of the impersonal good toward which attention is\noriented (and in this respect she is, again, inspired by Plato). \nWeil treats the connections among attention, void, and love, relying\non her supernatural (Christian Platonic) metaphysics, in “Forms\nof the Implicit Love of God”. \nTo empty ourselves [Se vider] of our false divinity, to deny\nourselves, to give up being the center of the world in imagination, to\ndiscern that all points in the world are equally centers and that the\ntrue center is outside the world, this is to consent to the rule of\nmechanical necessity in matter and of free choice at the center of\neach soul. Such consent is love. The face of this love, which is\nturned toward thinking persons, is the love of our neighbor. (WFG\n100) \nAttention can be seen as love, for just as attention consents to the\nexistence of another, love requires the recognition of a reality\noutside of the self, and thus de-centers the self and its\nparticularity. Contra the colloquial sense of love, it is\nbecause we do not love personally, but “it is God in us who\nloves them [les malheureux]” (WFG 93–94), that\nour love for others is “quite impersonal” and thereby\nuniversal (WFG 130). Weil allows, however, “one legitimate\nexception to the duty of loving universally”, namely, friendship\n(“Last Thoughts”, WFG 51). Friendship is “a personal\nand human love which is pure and which enshrines an intimation and a\nreflection of divine love” (WFG 131), a “supernatural\nharmony, a union of opposites” (WFG 126). The opposites that\nform the miraculous harmony are necessity/subordination (i.e., drawing\nfrom Thucydides’ Melian dialogue, she sees it as an\nimpossibility for one to want to preserve autonomy in both oneself and\nanother; in the world the stronger exerts force through will) and\nliberty/equality (which is maintained through the desire of each\nfriend to preserve the consent of oneself and of the other, a consent\nto be “two and not one” [WFG 135]). In other words, in\nfriendship a particular, self-founded reading of the other is not\nforced. Distance is maintained, and in this way Weil’s concept\nof friendship advances her previous critiques of the ethos of\ncapitalism, bureaucracy, and colonialism—i.e., free consent of\nall parties is the essential ingredient of all human relations that\nare not degraded or abusive. Hence friendship is a model for ethics\nmore generally—even, contra her claim, universally.\n \nFriendship has something universal about it. It consists of loving a\nhuman being as we should like to be able to love each soul in\nparticular of all those who go to make up the human race. (WFG\n135) \nWeil’s ethics of attention informs her later social-political\nphilosophy and epistemology. In relation to her social-political\nthought, attention suspends the self to allow for supernatural\njustice, which involves simultaneously turning attention to God and to\naffliction. Justice and the love of the neighbor are not distinct, for\nher. \nOnly the absolute identification of justice and love makes the\ncoexistence possible of compassion and gratitude on the one hand, and\non the other, of respect for the dignity of affliction\n[malheur] in the afflicted—a respect felt by the\nsufferer himself [les malheureux par lui-même] and the\nothers. (WFG 85) \nAdditionally, attention, in its consent to distance from and autonomy\nof the other, is an antidote to force. Important to Weil’s\nepistemology, attention militates against readings that are based on\nimagination, unexamined perceptions, or functions of the collectivity\n(e.g., prestige). Attention here manifests as independent, detached\nthought. In its religious valence involving obedience and consent,\nattention also bears on Weil’s epistemology in an additional\nway: it suggests that knowing the reality of the world is less an\nindividual achievement or attainment of mastery and more a gift of\ngrace—openness to what cannot be predicted and to what often\ntakes us by surprise. To moral gravity, the natural tendency of humans\ntoward expansion of self and injustice, grace inspires attention as an\nantidote. \nAlthough the metaphysics of Weil’s later thought was both\nChristian and Platonic, and therefore graceful and supernatural, her\nturn to God occurred not despite but, rather, because of her attention\nto reality and contact with the world. It is not the case, then, that\nher spiritual turn and “theological commitment”\n(Springsted 2015: 1–2) severed her contact with her early materialism,\nsolidarities, or Marxian considerations; rather, her spiritual turn\noccurred within this context, which would ground the religious\nphilosophy she would subsequently articulate. \nIn her late thought Weil presents an original creation theology. God,\nas purely good, infinite, and eternal, withdrew (or reduced Godself)\nso that something else (something less than fully good, finite, and\nspatio-temporally determinate) could exist, namely, the universe.\nImplicit in this outside-of-God universe is a contingency of forces.\nShe calls this principle of contingency, the “web of\ndeterminations” (McCullough 2014: 124) contrary to God,\n“necessity”. Necessity is “the screen”\n(l’écran) placed between God and creatures. Here\nher creation metaphysics echoes Plato’s distinction between the\nnecessary and the good in the Timaeus. Her Christian\ninflection translates this to the “supreme contradiction”\nbetween creature and creator; “it is Christ who represents the\nunity of these contradictories” (NB 386). \nWeil is clear that God and the world is less than God alone, yet that\nonly heightens the meaning of God’s abdication. That is, out of\nlove (for what would be the world and the creatures therein), God\ndecided to be lesser. Because existence—God’s very denial\nof Godself—is itself a mark of God’s love, providence is\ntherefore not found in particular interventions of God, but understood\nby recognizing the universe in all its contingency as the sum of\nGod’s intentions. In this theology rests an implication for\ncreatures. If humans are to imitate God, then they must also renounce\ntheir autonomy (including imagined “centeredness” in the\nuniverse) and power out of love for God and therefore the world; she\ncalls this “decreation”\n(décréation), which she describes paradoxically\nby “passive activity” (WFG 126) and, drawing on her\nreadings of the Bhagavad Gita, “non-active\naction” (NB 124). \nWeil articulates her religious philosophy through a series of\ndistinctions—of oppositions or contradictions. It is important\nto read the distinctions she makes not as positing dualisms, but as\nsuggesting contraries that are, unsynthesized, themselves mediations\nthrough which the soul is drawn upward. Her concept of\n“intermediaries”—or metaxu\n(μεταξύ), the Greek term she employs in\nher notebooks—becomes explicit beginning in 1939. Through\nmetaxu God is indirectly present in the world, specifically,\nfor example, in beauty, cultural traditions, law, and labor—all\nof which place us into contact with reality. In terms of her\nperiodization, her concept of mediation moved from relations of mind\nand matter on the level of the natural (found in the early Weil) to a\nmediation relating the natural intelligence to attention and love on\nthe level of the supernatural (at work in the late Weil), thus\nencompassing her early view through a universal perspective. \nGiven that reality is itself metaxu, Weil’s late\nconcept of mediation is more universal than the aforementioned\nspecific examples suggest. For her the real (le réel)\nitself is an obstacle that represents contradiction, an obstacle felt,\ne.g., in a difficult idea, in the presence of another, or in physical\nlabor; thus thought comes into contact with necessity and must\ntransform contradiction into correlation or mysterious and crucifying\nrelation, resulting in spiritual edification. Her explanation of this\nmediation is based on her idiosyncratic cosmology, especially its\nparadoxical claim that what is often painful reality, as distance from\nGod, is also, as intermediate, connection to God. She illustrates this\nclaim with the following metaphor: \nTwo prisoners whose cells adjoin communicate with each other by\nknocking on the wall. The wall is the thing which separates them but\nit is also their means of communication. It is the same with us and\nGod. Every separation is a link. (GG 145) \nIn developing her concept of the real, Weil is at pains to distinguish\nit from the imaginary. The imagination—problematized on\nepistemological grounds in her early thought—is criticized once\nagain in her religious philosophy for its insidious tendency to pose\nfalse consolations that at once invite idolatry or self-satisfaction,\nboth of which obviate real contemplation. This is why decreation, in\nwhich the individual withdraws her or his “I” and personal\nperspective so as to allow the real and others to give themselves, is\ncrucial not only spiritually, but also epistemologically and\nethically. It is, additionally and more radically, why Weil suggests\nthat atheism can be a kind of purification insofar as it negates\nreligious consolation that fills the void. For those for whom religion\namounts to an imagined “God who smiles on [them]” (GG 9),\natheism represents a necessary detachment. Crucially, for her, love is\npure not in the name of a personal God or its particular image, but\nonly when anonymous and universal. \nThe real leads us back to the aforementioned concept of\n“necessity”, for reality—essentially determinate,\nlimited, contingent, and conditional—is itself a “network\nof necessity” (Vetö 1971 [1994: 90]), such that necessity\nis a reflection of reality. Moreover, like “power” in her\nearly period and “force” in her middle period,\nWeil’s concept of necessity includes not only the physical\nforces of the created world, but also the social forces of human life.\nThrough necessity a sense of slavery remains in her thought, for\nhumans are ineluctably subject to necessity. In this way, enslavement\nto forces outside our control is essentially woven into the human\ncondition. \nTime, contrary to God as eternal, and along with space and matter, is\nfirst of all the most basic form of necessity. In its constant\nreminder of distance from God, and in the experience of enduring, and\nwaiting, time is also painful. Weil’s Christian Platonism comes\nto light in the two most poignant metaphors she uses to refer to time,\nnamely, the (Platonic) Cave and the (Christian) Cross. In both cases,\ntime is the weight or the pull of necessity, through which the soul,\nin any effort of the self, feels vulnerable, contingent, and\nunavoidably subject to necessity’s mediation here below\n(ici-bas). Time, then, is both the Cave where the self\npursues its illusory goals of expansion in the future and the Cross\nwhere necessity, a sign of God’s love, pins the self, suffering\nand mortal, to the world. \nImportantly, by 1942 in New York, Weil’s concept of time sides\nwith Plato against what she sees as Christian emphasis on\nprogress: \nChristianity was responsible for bringing this notion of progress,\npreviously unknown, into the world; and this notion, become the bane\nof the modern world, has de-Christianized it. We must abandon the\nnotion. We must get rid of our superstition of chronology in order to\nfind Eternity. (LPr 29) \nFor Weil progress does not carry normative implications of\nimprovement, for the Good is eternal and non-existent (in that it is\nneither spatial nor temporal); time must be consented to and suffered,\nnot fled. As for Christ on the cross, for creatures there is\nredemption not from but through suffering. She thus presents a\nsupernatural use of, not a remedy for, affliction. One form of sin,\nthen, is an attempt to escape time, for only God is time-out-of-mind.\nHowever, time, paradoxically, can also serve as metaxu. While\nmonotony is dreadful and fatiguing when it is in the form of a\npendulum’s swinging or a factory’s work, it is beautiful\nas a reflection of eternity, in the form of a circle (which unites\nbeing and becoming) or the sound of Gregorian chant. This beauty of\nthe world suggests, when read from the detached perspective, order\nbehind necessity, and God behind order.  \nA second form of necessity is “gravity”\n(pesanteur), as distinct from supernatural\n“grace”. If gravity signifies the forces of the natural\nworld that subject all created beings physically, materially, and\nsocially, and thus functions as a downward “pull” on the\n“turn” of attention to God and to the afflicted,\n“grace”, as a counter-balance, is the motivation by and\ngoodness of God. Grace pierces the world of necessity and serves to\norient, harmonize, and balance, thus providing a kind of\n“supernatural bread” for satiating the human void. Grace,\nentering the empirical world, disposes one to be purified by\ndetachment, waiting for a good that is real but that could never\n“exist” in a material sense (i.e., as subject to time,\nchange, force, etc.). For Weil, natural/necessary gravity (force) and\nsupernatural/spiritual grace (justice) are the two fundamental aspects\nof the created world, coming together most prominently in the\ncrucifixion. The shape of the cross itself reflects this intersection\nof the horizontal (necessity) and the vertical (grace). \nWeil’s concept of necessity bears on her late conceptualization\nof the subject. She connects seeing oneself as central to the world to\nseeing oneself as exempt from necessity. From this perspective, if\nsomething were to befall oneself, then the world would cease to have\nimportance; therefore, the assertive and willful self concludes,\nnothing could befall oneself. Affliction contradicts this perspective\nand thus forcefully de-centers the self. Unlike her existentialist\ncontemporaries such as Sartre, Weil did not think human freedom\nprincipally through agency; for late Weil, humans are free not\nontologically as a presence-to-self but supernaturally through\nobedience and consent. More than obedience, consent is the unity of\nnecessity in matter with freedom in creatures. A creature cannot\nnot obey; the only choice for the intelligent creature is to\ndesire or not to desire the good. The former—and here her\nstoicism through Marcus Aurelius and Spinoza emerges in her own appeal\nto amor fati—is a disposition that implies a consent to\nnecessity and a love of the order of the world, both of which mean\naccepting divine will. Consent, therefore, is a kind of reconciliation\nin her dialectic between the necessary and the good. Consent does not\nfollow from effort or will; rather, it expresses an ontological\nstatus, namely, decreation. In supernatural compassion one loves\nthrough evil: through distance (space) and through monotony\n(time), attending in a void and thinking freedom through\nnecessity—through the abdication of God. Thus, in regard to\ncontradiction and mediation, just as the intelligence must grapple\nwith mystery in Weil’s epistemology, so too love must be\nvulnerable and defenseless in the face of evil in her metaphysical and\nreligious philosophy. \nWeil’s metaphysic sheds light on her aesthetic philosophy, which\nis primarily Kantian and Platonic. For Weil beauty is a snare\n(à la Homer) set by God, trapping the soul so that God\nmight enter it. Necessity presents itself not only in gravity, time,\nand affliction, but also in beauty. The contact of impersonal good\nwith the faculty of sense is beauty; contact of evil with the faculty\nof sense is ugliness and suffering—both are contact with the\nreal, necessary, and providential.  \nWeil is a realist in regard to aesthetics in that she uses the\nlanguage of being gripped or grasped by beauty, which weaves, as it\nwere, a link among mind, body, world, and universe. Woven through the\nworld, but beyond relying simply on the individual’s mind or\nsenses, beauty, in this linking, lures and engenders awareness of\nsomething outside of the self. In paradoxical terms, for Weil,\nfollowing Kant, the aesthetic experience can be characterized as a\ndisinterested interestedness; against Kant, her telos of such\nexperience is Platonic, namely, to orient the soul to the\ncontemplation of the good. Moreover, for Weil beauty is purposive only\nbecause it is derivative of the good, i.e., the order of the world is\na function of God. In a revision of Kant’s line that beauty is a\nfinality without finality, then, she sees beauty not only as a kind of\nfeeling or presence of finality, but also as a gesture toward,\ninclination to, or promise of supernatural, transcendental\ngoodness. \nAt the same time, Weil’s concept of beauty is not only informed\nby her Platonism and thus marked by eternity, but it is also inspired\nby her experiences with Christ and hence features a kind of\nincarnation: the ideal can become a reality in the world. As such,\nbeauty is a testament to and manifestation of the balance or\nequilibrium of the network of inflexible necessity that is the natural\nworld—a network that, in some sense, the intelligence can grasp.\nIt is in this way—not as an ontological category but, rather, as\na sensible experience—that through beauty necessity becomes the\nobject of love (i.e., in Kantian terms, beauty is regulative, not\nconstitutive). Thus beauty is metaxu attracting the soul to\nGod, and as metaxu, beauty serves as a “locus of\nincommensurability” (Winch 1989: 173) between the fragile\ncontingency of time (change, becoming, death) and an eternal\nreality. \nBecause beauty is the order of the world as necessity, strictly\nspeaking (and like Weil’s conception of providence) it is\nuniversal; “beauty” applies principally to the world as a\nwhole, and therefore consent to beauty must be total. Thus it\nfunctions as an “implicit love of God” [see WFG 99]. More\nspecifically, on the level of the particular there are, secondarily,\ntypes of beauty that nevertheless demonstrate balance, order,\nproportion, and thus their divine provenance (e.g., those found in\nnature, art, and science). \nOne’s recognition of the beauty/order of the world has\nimplications, once again, for the subject. Because beauty is to be\ncontemplated at a distance and in consent, not consumed through the\ngreedy will, it trains the soul to be detached in the face of\nsomething irreducible, and in this sense it is similar to affliction.\nBoth de-center the self and demand a posture of waiting\n(attente). Contemplating beauty, then, means transcending the\nperspective of one’s own project. Because beauty, as external to\nself, is to be consented to, it implies both that one’s reality\nis limited and that one does not want to change the object of her/his\nmode of engagement. Furthermore, beauty has an element of the\nimpersonal coming into contact with a person. Real interaction with\nbeauty is decreative. True to this claim, Weil’s aesthetic\ncommitments are reflected in her style: in her sharp prose she\nscrutinizes her own thought while tending to exclude her own voice and\navoid personal references; thus she performs “the linguistic\ndecreation of the self” (Dargan 1999: 7). \nAlthough the French post-structuralists who succeeded Weil did not\nengage extensively with her thought, her concepts carry a legacy\nthrough her contemporaries domestically and her heirs internationally\n(see Rozelle-Stone 2017). In regard to her generation of French\nthinkers, the influence of “attention” can be seen in the\nwritings of Maurice Blanchot; her Platonic sense of good, order, and\nclarity was taken up—and rejected—by both Georges Bataille\nand Emmanuel Levinas. Following Weil’s generation, in his\nyounger years Jacques Derrida took interest in her mysticism and,\nspecifically, her purifying atheism, only to leave her behind almost\nentirely in his later references (Baring 2011). It is possible that\nWeil’s limited influence on poststructuralists is derived not\nonly from the fact that she was not influenced by Nietzsche and\nHeidegger to the extent of the four aforementioned French thinkers,\nbut also, quite simply, because she did not survive World War II and\nhence did not write thereafter. It is also important to note that\nthroughout her life, Weil’s status as a female philosopher\ncontributed to ad hominem attacks against her person, not her\nthought; she was often perceived as “psychologically cold”\nas opposed to being engaged in “an ethical project with\ndifferent assumptions” (Nelson 2017: 9). \nAcross Europe and more recently, Weil’s “negative\npolitics”—that is, turning away from institutions and\nideology and toward religious reflection—, in conjunction with\nMichel Foucault’s concept of biopolitics, has been taken up by\nthe political philosophies of Giorgio Agamben and Roberto Esposito\n(Ricciardi 2009). In doing so, Agamben (who wrote his dissertation on\nWeil’s political thought and critique of personhood, ideas of\nwhich went on to shape Homo Sacer [see Agamben 2017]) and\nEsposito rely on Weil’s concepts of decreation, impersonality,\nand force. Beyond the Continental scene, her Christian\nPlatonism—especially her concepts of the good, justice, void,\nand attention—influenced Iris Murdoch’s emphasis on the\ngood, metaphysics, and morality, and was thereby part of a recent\nrevival in virtue ethics (Crisp & Slote 1997). The legacy of\nWeil’s writings on affliction and beauty in relation to justice\nis also felt in Elaine Scarry’s writings on aesthetics (Scarry\n1999). T. S. Eliot, who wrote the introduction to The Need for\nRoots, cites Weil as an inspiration of his literature, as do W.\nH. Auden, Czeslaw Milosz, Seamus Heaney, Flannery O’Connor,\nSusan Sontag, and Anne Carson. \nIn Anglo-American academic consideration, Weil scholarship has\nemphasized her concept of supernatural justice, including the\nphilosophical tensions that inform her materialism and mysticism\n(Winch 1989; Dietz 1988; Bell 1993, 1998; Rhees 2000). Additional considerations treat her\nChristian Platonism (Springsted 1983; Doering & Springsted 2004).\nRecent English-language scholarship on Weil has included texts on her\nconcept of force (Doering 2010), her radicalism (Rozelle-Stone &\nStone 2010), and the relationship in her thought between science and\ndivinity (Morgan 2005), between suffering and trauma (Nelson 2017),\nand between decreation and ethics (Cha 2017). Furthermore, her concepts\nhave influenced recent contributions to questions of identity (Cameron\n2007), political theology (Lloyd 2011), and animality (Pick 2011).","contact.mail":"adrian.rozelle@und.edu","contact.domain":"und.edu"},{"date.published":"2018-03-10","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simone-weil/","author1":"A. Rebecca Rozelle-Stone","author2":"Benjamin P. Davis","entry":"simone-weil","body.text":"\n\n\nSimone Weil (1909–1943) philosophized on thresholds and across\nborders. Her persistent desire for truth and justice led her to both\nelite academies and factory floors, political praxis and spiritual\nsolitude. At different times she was an activist, a pacifist, a\nmilitant, a mystic, and an exile; but throughout, in her inquiry into\nreality and orientation to the good, she remained a philosopher. Her\noeuvre features deliberate contradiction yet demonstrates remarkable\nclarity. It is value centered and integrated but not systematic. It\ncontains scattered notes of her translations of and commentaries on\nseveral ancient Greek texts, Pythagorean geometry formulae, and\ndetailed accounts of her daily tasks within a factory; but her oeuvre\nis also composed of addresses to political, industrial, and religious\nleaders as well as pieces intended for university students, radical\nmilitants, industrial workers, and farm laborers. In both her life and\nher thought—itself an unstable distinction with respect to\nWeil—she is a philosopher of margins and paradoxes. In part\nbecause Weil’s thought defies categorization, the ways in which\nher ideas are taken up often say as much about her commentator as they\ndo about her. She was taken as a prototype for Albert Camus’s\nrévoltés and praised by André Gide as\n“the patron saint of all outsiders”. Giorgio Agamben\ndescribed her conscience as “the most lucid of our times”,\nand Hannah Arendt claimed that perhaps only Weil treated the subject\nof labor “without prejudice and sentimentality”. Maurice\nBlanchot described Weil as an “exceptional figure” who\noffers “an example of certitude” in the modern world, and\nIris Murdoch wrote of “a profoundly disciplined life behind her\nwritings” that gave “an authority which cannot be\nimitated”. But Weil was also criticized by Leon Trotsky as a\n“melancholy revolutionary” and disparaged as\n“crazy” by Charles de Gaulle. These remarks, however,\nbetray an irony of which Weil was well aware and about which she was\ndeeply concerned near the end of her life, namely, that her person\nwould be considered more than her thought. By categorically focusing\non the philosophical concepts Weil articulated and developed, this\nentry attempts to present her philosophy while speaking to her\nconcern.\n\n\nFollowing Weil’s philosophical development, her central concepts\nare addressed under five categories: social-political philosophy,\nepistemology, ethics, metaphysical and religious philosophy, and\naesthetics. The periodization employed is as follows: 1925–1934\n(early), 1935–1939 (middle), 1939–1943 (late). It is\nimportant to note that, given Weil’s rejection of systematicity\nand development of concepts, these categories and periods introduce a\ndegree of artifice into her thought. The conclusion of this entry\nreports on her reception among the Continental and Anglo-American\ntraditions of philosophy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimone Weil was born in Paris on 3 February 1909. Her parents, both of\nwhom came from Jewish families, provided her with an assimilated,\nsecular, bourgeois French childhood both cultured and comfortable.\nBoth Weil and her older brother André—himself a math\nprodigy, founder of the Bourbaki group, and a distinguished\nmathematician at the Princeton Institute for Advanced\nStudy—studied at prestigious Parisian schools. Weil’s\nfirst philosophy teacher, at the Lycée Victor-Duruy, was\nRené Le Senne; it was he who introduced her to the\nthesis—which she would maintain—that contradiction is a\ntheoretical obstacle generative of nuanced, alert thinking. Beginning\nin October 1925, Weil studied at Henri IV Lycée in preparation\nfor the entrance exams of the École Normale Supérieure.\nAt Henri IV she studied under the philosopher and essayist\nÉmile-Auguste Chartier (known pseudonymously as Alain), whose\nteacher was Jules Lageneau. Like Weil at this time, Alain was\nagnostic. In his classes he emphasized intellectual history: in\nphilosophy this included Plato, Marcus Aurelius, Descartes, Spinoza,\nand Kant, and in literature, Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and\nEuripides. Already sympathetic with the downtrodden and critical of\nFrench society, she gained the theoretical tools to levy critiques\nagainst her country and philosophical tradition in Alain’s\nclass. There, employing paradox and attention through the form of the\nessay (it is important to note that none of her writings was published\nas a book in her lifetime), she began intentionally developing what\nwould become her distinct mode of philosophizing. It is therefore\narguable that she is part of the Alain/Lagneau line of voluntarist,\nspiritueliste philosophy in France. \nIn 1928 Weil began her studies at the École Normale. She was\nthe only woman in her class, the first woman having been first\nadmitted in 1917. In 1929–1930 she worked on her dissertation on\nknowledge and perception in Descartes, and having received her\nagrégation diploma, she served from late 1931 to\nmid-1934 as a teacher at lycées. Throughout this\nperiod, outside of her duties at each lycée where she\ninstructed professionally, Weil taught philosophy to, lobbied for, and\nwrote on behalf of workers’ groups; at times, moreover, she\nherself joined in manual labor. In her early thinking she prized at\nonce the first-person perspective and radical skepticism of Descartes,\nthe class-based solidarity and materialist analysis of Marx, and the\nmoral absolutism and respect for the individual of Kant. Drawing from\neach, her early work can be read as an attempt to provide, with a view\ntoward liberty, her own analysis of the fundamental causes of\noppression in society. \nIn early August 1932, Weil travelled to Germany in order to understand\nbetter the conditions fostering Nazism. German trade unions, she wrote\nto friends upon her return to France, were the single force in Germany\nable to generate a revolution, but they were fully reformist. Long\nperiods of unemployment left many Germans without energy or esteem. At\nbest, she observed frankly, they could serve as a kind of dead weight\nin a revolution. More specifically, by early 1933 Weil criticized the\ntendency of social organizations to engender bureaucracy, which\nelevated management and collective thinking over and against the\nindividual worker. Against this tendency, she advocated for\nworkers’ understanding the physical labor they performed within\nthe context of the whole organizational apparatus. In\n“Reflections Concerning the Causes of Liberty and Social\nOppression” (1934), Weil presented both a summation of her early\nthought and a prefiguring of central elements in her thematic\ntrajectory. The essay employs a Marxian method of analysis that pays\nattention to the oppressed, critiques her own position as an\nintellectual, privileges manual labor, and demands precise and\nunorthodox individual thinking that unites theory and practice against\ncollective clichés, propaganda, obfuscation, and\nhyper-specialization. These ideas would provide a theoretical\nframework for her idiosyncratic practice of philosophy. Near the end\nof her life she wrote in a notebook: “Philosophy (including\nproblems of cognition, etc.) is exclusively an affair of\naction and practice” (FLN 362). \nOn 20 June, 1934, Weil applied for a sabbatical from teaching. She was\nto spend a year working in Parisian factories as part of its most\noppressed group, unskilled female laborers. Weil’s “year\nof factory work” (which amounted, in actuality, to around 24\nweeks of laboring) was not only important in the development of her\npolitical philosophy but can also be seen as a turning point in her\nslow religious evolution. \nIn Paris’s factories, Weil began to see and to comprehend\nfirsthand the normalization of brutality in modern industry. There,\nshe wrote in her “Factory Journal”, “[t]ime was an\nintolerable burden” (FW 225) as modern factory work comprised\ntwo elements principally: orders from superiors and, relatedly,\nincreased speeds of production. While the factory managers continued\nto demand more, both fatigue and thinking (itself less likely under\nsuch conditions) slowed work. As a result, Weil felt dehumanized.\nPhenomenologically, her factory experience was less one of physical\nsuffering per se, and more one of humiliation. Weil was\nsurprised that this humiliation produced not rebellion but rather\nfatigue, docility. She described her experience in factories as a kind\nof “slavery”. On a trip to Portugal in August 1935, upon\nwatching a procession to honor the patron saint of fishing villagers,\nshe had her first major contact with Christianity and wrote that  \nthe conviction was suddenly borne in upon [her] that Christianity is\npre-eminently the religion of slaves, that slaves cannot help\nbelonging to it, and [she] among others. (1942 “Spiritual\nAutobiography” in WFG 21–38, 26)  \nIn comparison with her pre-factory “Testament”, we see\nthat in her “Factory Journal” Weil maintains the language\nof liberty, but she moves terminologically from\n“oppression” to “humiliation” and\n“affliction”. Thus her conception and description of\nsuffering thickened and became more personal at this time. \nWeil participated in the 1936 Paris factory occupations and, moreover,\nplanned on returning to factory work. Her trajectory shifted, however,\nwith the advent of the Spanish Civil War. Critical of both civil and\ninternational war, on the level of geopolitics, she approved of\nFrance’s decision not to intervene on the Republican side. On\nthe level of individual commitment, however, she obtained\njournalist’s credentials and joined an international anarchist\nbrigade. On 20 August, 1936, Weil, clumsy and nearsighted, stepped in\na pot of boiling oil, severely burning her lower left leg and instep.\nOnly her parents could persuade her not to return to combat. By late\n1936 Weil wrote against French colonization of Indochina, and by early\n1937 she argued against French claims to Morocco and Tunisia. In April\n1937 she travelled to Italy. Within the basilica Santa Maria degli\nAngeli, inside the small twelfth-century Romanesque chapel where St.\nFrancis prayed, Weil had her second significant contact with\nChristianity. As she would later describe in a letter,\n“[S]omething stronger than I compelled me for the first time to\ngo down on my knees” (WFG 26). \nFrom 1937–1938 Weil revisited her Marxian commitments, arguing\nthat there is a central contradiction in Marx’s thought:\nalthough she adhered to his method of analysis and demonstration that\nthe modern state is inherently oppressive—being that it is\ncomposed of the army, police, and bureaucracy—she continued to\nreject any positing of revolution as immanent or determined. Indeed,\nin Weil’s middle period, Marx’s confidence in history\nseemed to her a worse ground for judgment than Machiavelli’s\nemphasis on contingency. \nDuring the week of Easter 1938, Weil visited the Benedictine abbey of\nSolesmes from Palm Sunday to the following Tuesday. At Solesmes she\nhad her third contact with Christianity: suffering from headaches,\nWeil found a joy so pure in Gregorian chant that, by analogy, she\ngained an understanding  \nof the possibility of living divine love in the midst of affliction.\nIt goes without saying that in the course of these services the\nthought of the passion of Christ entered into [her] being once and for\nall. (WFG 26)   \nAt Solesmes, she was also introduced to the seventeenth century\npoet George Herbert by a young Englishman she met there. She claimed\nto feel Christ’s presence while reciting Herbert’s poem\n“Love”. As she fixed her full attention on the poem while\nsuffering from her most intense headache, Weil came to see that her\nrecitation had the virtue of prayer, saying, “Christ himself\ncame down and took possession of me” (WFG 27). Importantly, she\nthought God “in his mercy” had prevented her from reading\nthe mystics until that point; therefore, she could not say that she\ninvented her unexpected contact with Christ (WFG 27). These events and\nwritings in 1936–1938 exemplify the mutually informing nature of\nsolidarity and spirituality in Weil’s thought that began in\nAugust 1935. \nAfter the military alliance of Germany and Italy in May 1939, Weil\nrenounced her pacifism. It was not that she felt she was wrong in holding\nsuch a position before, but now, she argued, France was no longer\nstrong enough to remain generous or merely defensive. Following the\nGerman Western offensive, she left Paris with her family in June 1940,\non the last train. They settled eventually but temporarily in\nMarseilles, at the time the main gathering point for those attempting\nto flee France, and where Weil would work with the Resistance. \nIn Vichy France Weil took up a practice she had long sought, namely,\nto apprentice herself to the life of agricultural laborers. In\naddition, in Marseilles she was introduced to the Dominican priest\nJoseph-Marie Perrin, who became a close friend as well as a spiritual\ninterlocutor, and through whom she began to consider the question of\nbaptism. In an effort to help Weil find a job as an agricultural\nlaborer, Perrin turned to his friend Gustave Thibon, a Catholic writer\nwho owned a farm in the Ardéche region. Thus in Fall 1941 Weil\nworked in the grape harvest. Importantly, however, she was not treated\nlike the rest of the laborers; although she worked a full eight hours\nper day, she resided and ate at the house of her employers. It is said\nthat she carried Plato’s Symposium with her in the\nvineyards and attempted to teach the text to her fellow laborers. \nIn 1942 Weil agreed to leave France in part so her parents would be in\na safe place (they would not leave without her, she knew), but\nprincipally because she thought she might be more useful for\nFrance’s war effort if she were in another country. Thus she\nwent to New York via Morocco. In New York, as in Marseilles, she\nfilled notebook after notebook with philosophical, theological, and\nmathematical considerations. New York, however, felt removed from the\nsufferings of her native France; the Free French movement in London\nfelt one step closer to returning to France. In 1943 Weil was given a\nsmall office at 19 Hill Street in London. From this room she would\nwrite day and night for the next four months, sleeping around three\nhours each night. Her output in this period totaled around 800 printed\npages, but she resigned from the Free French movement in late July\n(Pétrement 1973 [1976: xx]). \nWeil died Tuesday, 24 August 1943. Three days later, the coroner\npronounced her death a suicide—cardiac failure from\nself-starvation and tuberculosis. The accounts provided by her\nbiographers tell a more complex story: Weil was aware that her fellow\ncountry-men and women in the occupied territory had to live on minimal\nfood rations at this time, and she had insisted on the same for\nherself, which exacerbated her physical illness (Von der Ruhr 2006:\n18). On 30 August she was buried at Ashford’s New Cemetery\nbetween the Jewish and the Catholic sections. Her grave was originally\nanonymous. For fifteen years Ashford residents thought it was a\npauper’s. \nAlways writing from the left, Weil continually revised her\nsocial-political philosophy in light of the rapidly changing material\nconditions in which she lived. However, she was consistent in her\nacute attention to and theorizing from the situation of the oppressed\nand marginalized in society. \nHer early essays on politics, a number of which were posthumously\ncollected by Albert Camus in Oppression et liberté\n(OL), include “Capital and the Worker” (1932),\n“Prospects: Are We Heading for the Proletarian\nRevolution?” (1933), “Reflections concerning Technology,\nNational Socialism, the U.S.S.R., and certain other matters”\n(1933) and, most importantly, “Reflections concerning the Causes\nof Liberty and Social Oppression” (1934 in OL 36–117). In\nher early writings, Weil attempted to provide an analysis of the real\ncauses of oppression so as to inform militants in revolutionary\naction. Her concern was that, without this analysis, a socially\nenticing movement would lead only to superficial changes in the\nappearance of the means of production, not to new forms of structural\norganization. \nThe division of labor or the existence of material privilege alone is\nnot a sufficient condition for Weil’s concept of\n“oppression”. That is, she recognized that there are some\nforms of social relations involving deference, hierarchy, and order\nthat are not necessarily oppressive. However, the intervention of the\nstruggle for power—which she, following Hobbes, sees as an\ninexorable feature of human society—generates oppression. \n[P]ower [puissance] contains a sort of fatality which weighs\nas pitilessly on those who command as on those who obey; nay more, it\nis in so far as it enslaves the former that, through their agency, it\npresses down upon the latter (“Reflections concerning the Causes\nof Liberty and Social Oppression”, OL 62). \nOppression, then, is a specific social organization that, as a\nconsequence of the essentially unstable struggle for power, and\nprincipally the structure of labor, limits the individual from\nexperiencing the world to the full extent of her or his full\ncapability, a capability Weil describes as “methodical\nthinking” (pénsee méthodique). By\ndivorcing the understanding from the application of a method,\noppression, exercised through force, denies human beings direct\ncontact with reality. Also informing her sense of oppression is her\nnotion of “privilege”, which includes not only money or\narms, but also a corpus of knowledge closed to the working masses\nthat, thereby, engenders a culture of specialists. Privilege thus\nexacerbates oppression in modern societies, which are held together\nnot by shared goals, meaningful relations, or organically developing\ncommunities, but through a “religion of power” (OL 69). In\nthis way, both power and prestige contribute to a modern reversal of\nmeans and ends. That is, elements like money, technology, and\nwar—all properly speaking “means”—are, through\nthe workings of power, treated as “ends” worthy of\nfurtherance, enhancement, and multiplication without limit. \nIn her early social-political thought Weil testified to what she\ncalled “a new species of oppression”\n(“Prospects”, OL 9), namely, the bureaucracy of modern\nindustry. Both her anarchism and Marxian method of analysis influenced\nhow she problematized revolutionary struggle: the problem lies in\nforming a social organization that does not engender bureaucracy, an\nanonymous and institutionalized manifestation of force. The oppression\nof modern bureaucracy, to which she responded through analysis and\ncritique, includes clichéd, official and obscurantist language,\nprofessionalization—the “caste privileges” of\nintellectuals (“Technology, National Socialism, the\nU.S.S.R”, OL 34)— and a division of labor such that, in\nthe case of most workers, labor does not involve, but in fact\nprecludes, engaged thinking. Out of balance in this way, modern humans\nlive as cogs in a machine: less like thinking individuals, and more\nlike instruments crushed by “collectivities”.\nCollectivity—a concept that centrally comprises industry,\nbureaucracy, and the state (the “bureaucratic organization\npar excellence” [OL 109]), but that also includes\npolitical parties, churches, and unions—by definition quashes\nindividual subjectivity. \nDespite her critiques of oppression, prestige, and collectivity, in a\npolemical argument Weil is also critical of “revolution”,\nwhich for her refers to an inversion of forces, the victory of the\nweak over the powerful. This, she says, is “the equivalent of a\nbalance whose lighter scale were to go down” (OL 74).\n“Revolution” in its colloquial or deterministic sense,\nthen, has itself become an “opiate”, a word for which the\nlaboring masses die, but which lies empty. For Weil, real revolution\nis precisely the re-organization of labor such that it subordinates\nthe laborers neither to management (as in bureaucracy) nor to\noppressive conditions (as in factory work). As she sees it, if\nrevolution is to have meaning, it is only as a regulative, and not a\npositive, ideal (OL 53). In Weil’s adaptation of this Kantian\nnotion, such a regulative ideal involves an attention to reality,\ne.g., to the present political and working conditions, to human\nconditions such as the struggle for power. Only thus can it provide a\nstandard of analysis for action: the ideal allows for a dialectical\nrelation between a revolutionary alternative and present praxis, which\nis always grounded in material conditions. Freedom, then, is a unity\nof thought and action. It is, moreover—and not unlike in\nHegel’s conceptualization—a condition of balanced\nrelations to and dependence on both others (who check our autonomy)\nand the world (which is limited and limiting). A freeing mode of\nproduction, as opposed to an alienating and oppressing one, would\ninvolve a relation to thinking and to others throughout the course of\nlabor. When workers understand both the mechanical procedures and the\nefforts of other members of the collectivity, the collectivity itself\nbecomes subject to individuals, i.e., means and ends are rightfully in\na relation of equilibrium. \nThe ontology behind Weil’s notion of free labor draws on the\nKantian emphasis on the individual as an end—especially, for\nWeil, in her or his capacity for thinking (with Plato, for whom\nknowing and doing are united). In addition, the teleology of labor in\nWeil’s philosophy corresponds with the thought of Hegel and\nMarx, and is in opposition to Locke: in the individual’s mixing\nwith the material world, her interest lies in how this promotes\nliberty, rather than property. The uprooting Weil experienced in\nfactory work introduced a shift in her conception of freedom: as she\nbegan to see the human condition as not just one of inexorable\nstruggle, but of slavery, her notion of freedom shifted from a\nnegative freedom from constraints to a positive freedom to obey. She\nreferred to the latter, a particular kind of relational freedom, as\n“consent”. She concluded her “inventory of modern\ncivilization” (OL 116) with a call to introduce play into the\nbureaucratic machine and a call to think as individuals, denying the\n“social idol” by “refusing to subordinate\none’s own destiny to the course of history” and by taking\nup “critical analysis” (OL 117). In sum, by 1934 Weil\npictured an ideal society, which she conceptualized as a regulative\nimpossibility in which manual labor, understood and performed by\nthinking individuals, was a “pivot” toward liberty. \nWeil’s “Factory Journal” from 1934–1935\nsuggests a shift in her social-political philosophy. During this\nperiod, her political pessimism deepened. In light of the humiliating\nwork she conducted in the factories, her post-factory writings feature\na terminological intensification: from “humiliation” and\n“oppression” to “affliction”\n(malheur), a concept informed by her factory experience of\nembodied pain combined with psychological agony and social\ndegradation—and to which she would later add spiritual\ndistress. \nIn 1936 Weil advanced her political commitments in ways that\nforeshadowed her later social-political thought. She continued to\neschew revolution and instead to work toward reform, namely, greater\nequality in the factory through a shift from a structure of\nsubordination to one of collaboration. In addition, in response to the\noutbreak of the Spanish Civil War, she argued against fascism while\nfavoring—against the Communist position—French\nnon-intervention. She was opposed to authoritarian logic, and she saw\ngoing to war as a kind of surrender to the logic of power and prestige\ninherent in fascism.  \nOne must choose between prestige and peace. And whether one claims to\nbelieve in the fatherland, democracy, or revolution, the policy of\nprestige means war. (1936 “Do We Have to Grease Our Combat\nBoots”, FW 258) \nWeil’s development of the concepts of power and prestige\ncontinued in her article “Let Us Not Start Another Trojan\nWar” (1936, subtitled, and translated into English as,\n“The Power of Words” in SWA 238–258). Her thesis is\nthat a war’s destruction is inversely proportional to the\nofficial pretexts given for fighting it. Wars are absurd, she argued\n(against Clausewitz), because “they are conflicts with no\ndefinable objective” (SWA 239). Like the phantom of Helen\nthat inspired ten years of fighting, ideologies (e.g., capitalism,\nsocialism, fascism), as well as capitalized words such as\n“Nation” and “State”, have taken on the role\nof the phantom in the modern world. Power relies on\nprestige—itself illusory and without limit because no nation\nthinks it has enough or is sure of maintaining its imagined glory, and\nin response ever increases its means to wage war—so as to appear\nabsolute and invincible. In response to these forces, Weil prescribed\ndistinguishing between the imaginary and the real and, relatedly,\ndefining words properly and precisely. Taken together, these\nprescriptions amount to a critique of ideology and political rhetoric\n(a critique Weil articulated more fully in her later writings). \n[W]hen a word is properly defined it loses its capital letter and can\nno longer serve either as a banner or as a hostile slogan; it becomes\nsimply a sign, helping us to grasp some concrete reality or concrete\nobjective, or method of activity. To clarify thought, to discredit the\nintrinsically meaningless words, and to define the use of others by\nprecise analysis—to do this, strange though it may appear, might\nbe a way of saving human lives. (SWA 242) \nFurther, Weil desired a kind of equilibrium, a balance between forces\ninstead of an endless pursuit of an illusion of absolute stability.\nFollowing Heraclitus, she saw struggle as a condition of life. What is\nrequired of the thinking individual, in turn, is to distinguish\nbetween worthwhile conflict, such as class struggle, and illusions of\nprestige, such as war. In her middle period, then, Weil maintained the\ncontrariety between reality, limit, and equilibrium on the one hand\nand imagination, limitlessness, and collectivity on the other. In her\n1937 “Note on Social Democracy”, she defined politics as\nfollows: \nThe material of the political art is the double perspective, ever\nshifting between the real conditions of social equilibrium and the\nmovements of collective imagination. Collective imagination, whether\nof mass meetings or of meetings in evening dress, is never correctly\nrelated to the really decisive factors of a given social situation; it\nis always beside the point, or ahead of it, or behind it. (SE 152) \nIn her late period Weil provided an explication of the all-pervasive,\nindeed indiscriminate, concept of “force” in the essay\n“The Iliad or the Poem of Force” (1940 in SWA\n182–215). It is important to note Weil’s locus of\nenunciation for this concept, temporally after the fall of France\nand spatially from a position of exile, including antisemitic\nmarginalization, which is why the essay appeared in the December 1940\nand January 1941 Cahiers du Sud under the anagrammatic\npseudonym Emile Novis, taken up by Weil to avoid antisemitic\nconfrontation and censorship. This essay was not only the most widely\nread of Weil’s pieces during her lifetime, but it was also her\nfirst essay to appear in English, translated by Mary McCarthy and\npublished in Dwight Macdonald’s magazine Politics in 1945\n(November, pp. 321–330). \nIn her essay on the Iliad—a text Roberto Esposito calls\n“a phenomenology of force” (Esposito 1996 [2017:\n46])—Weil further develops an understanding of force initially\npresented in her earlier, unfinished essay “Reflections on\nBarbarism” (1939): “I believe that the concept of force\nmust be made central in any attempt to think clearly about human\nrelations” (quoted in Pétrement 1973 [1976: 361]). The\nprotagonist of the Iliad, Weil writes in an original reading,\nis not Achilles or Hector, but force itself. Like her concept of\n“power” in her early writings, “force” reifies\nand dehumanizes no matter if one wields or undergoes it. Further,\nforce includes not only coercion, but also prestige, which is to say\nthat it has a social element. Two important implications follow.\nFirst, on the level of the individual, each “personality”\n(la personne) is informed by social values and thereby\nfeatures the operations of force through accidental characteristics,\nsuch as the name of the family into which one is born or the embodied\nfeatures that are considered physically attractive at a certain place,\nin a certain society, at a certain time. Second, on the level of the\ncollectivity, force can destroy not only bodies, but also values and\ncultures, as is the case, Weil is at pains to point out, in French\ncolonialism. In her mid-to-late writings, then, Weil saw neither\nMarx’s notion of class nor Hegel’s self-development of\nGeist, but force itself, as the key to history. She presents\nthis concept as twofold: as, “in its grossest and most summary\nform”, “the force that kills”, and, more\nunpredictably in its effects, as a specific kind of violence\n“that does not kill just yet”, though  \n[i]t will surely kill, it will possibly kill, or perhaps it merely\nhangs, poised and ready, over the head of the creature it can\nkill, at any moment, which is to say at every moment. (SWA\n184–185)  \nWeil’s concept of force, then, is also a development from Hobbes\nand Hegel: it names that which renders the individual a slave. \nIt was in London (1942–1943), during her work for the Free\nFrench, that Weil articulated her most robust late social-political\nphilosophy. Her concepts of “labor” and\n“justice” thickened as she moved further toward\nChristianity and—against her early emphasis on the\nindividual—toward the social. Weil’s pièces\nd’occasion from this time period include “Draft for a\nStatement of Human Obligations” (1943), written in response to\nde Gaulle’s State Reform Commission in its drafting of a new\nDeclaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, as well as “Note\non the General Suppression of Political Parties” (1943), written\nbecause the Free French was considering recognizing political parties.\nIn this piece Weil argues for the complete abolition of political\nparties. Drawing on Rousseau’s concept of the general will, Weil\ncontends that political parties subdue the independent, individual\nwills of which the general will is derivative and on which democracy\ndepends. Most important from this period was her major work The\nNeed for Roots (L’enracinement), which Weil called\nher second “magnum opus” (SL 186), and which Albert Camus\npublished posthumously in 1949, with Gallimard, as the first of 11\nvolumes of Weil’s he would promote. \nWeil wrote additional essays in London, the most conceptually\nimportant of which was “La Personne et le\nsacré” (1942–1943, translated into English as\n“Human Personality”), in which she critiques\n“rights” as reliant on force and poses as counter-terms\n“obligation” and “justice”. She distinguishes\nbetween two conceptions of justice: natural (hence social and\ncontingent) and supernatural (hence impersonal and eternal). The\nNeed for Roots (1943 NR) adds “needs of the soul” as\nanother counter-balance to rights. Overall, Weil presents not a\nlaw-based or rights-based, but a compassion-based morality, involving\nobligations to another that are discernible through attention,\ncentered on and evolving toward a supernatural justice that is not of\nthe world, but that can be in it. As a departure from Kant, and\nthrough Plato, whom Weil “came to feel… was a\nmystic” (“Spiritual Autobiography”, WFG 28), the\nbasis of her sense of (supernatural) justice was not human\nrationality, but a desire for the Good, which she believed all humans\nshare, even if at times they forget or deny this. Importantly, given\nher critique of French colonialism, and despite her claim that\nobligations to another must be indiscriminate, i.e., universal, she\ndid not want to universalize law in a Kantian fashion. Rather, her aim\nwas for cultures to continue their own traditions, for the goal of\nrootedness (l’enracinement) is not to change cultural\nvalues per se, but more precisely, to change how individuals\nin those cultures read and orient themselves toward those values. \nWeil’s concept of “roots” is crucial to her late\npolitical thought. With connotations of both vitality and\nvulnerability, “roots” conceptualizes human society as\ndynamic and living while attesting to the necessity of stability and\nsecurity if growth and flourishing are to occur on the level of the\nindividual. Beyond the organic metaphor on the level of the natural,\nher concept of roots serves as a kind of bridge between the reality of\nsociety and the ideal of supernatural justice. Roots do this by\nmanifesting human subjection to material and historical conditions,\nincluding the need to participate in the life of a community, to feel\na sense of connection to a place, and to maintain temporal links,\ne.g., to cultural history and to hopes for the future. In turn, a\nrooted community allows for the development of the individual with a\nview toward God or eternal values. As such, and contra her\nearly and middle maintenance of a critical distance from any\ncollectivity (any Great Beast, to use the Platonic metaphor she\nfrequently employs), in her late thought Weil sees roots as allowing\nfor a “new patriotism” based on compassion. The\nestablishing of roots (l’enracinement) enables multiple\nrelations to the world (e.g., on the level of the nation, the\norganically developing community, the school) that at once nourish the\nindividual and the community. \nIn addition to war and colonization, in The Need for Roots\nWeil points to money and to contemporary education as\nself-perpetuating forces that uproot human life. The longest section\nof the text describes modern uprootedness\n(déracinement), occurring when the imagined modern\nnation and money are the only binding forces in society, and she\ncharacterizes this condition as a threat to the human soul. Modern\neducation is corrupted both by capitalism—such that it is\nnothing except “a machine for producing diplomas, in other\nwords, jobs” (NR 118)—and by a Roman inheritance for\ncultivating prestige with respect to the nation: “It is this\nidolatry of self which they have bequeathed to us in the form of\npatriotism” (NR 137). As an alternative to modern uprootedness,\nWeil presents a civilization based not on force, which turns a person\ninto a thing, but on free labor, which in its engagement with and\nconsent to necessary forces at play in the world, including time and\ndeath, allows for direct contact with reality. Moreover, Weil’s\nwriting in The Need for Roots is refracted through her\nreligious experience. In this later period, then, she no longer\nconceptualizes labor in the mechanical terms of a “pivot”\nas she did in her early writings; it is now the “spiritual\ncore” of “a well-ordered social life” (NR 295). (In\nher late social-political philosophy, in fact, a spiritual revolution\nis more important than an economic one.) Contra the Greeks,\nwho devalued physical work, her conception of labor serves to mediate\nbetween the natural and the supernatural. In her late writings, labor\nis fully inflected by her faith in light of her experiences with\nChristianity. As such, labor’s consent to and, moreover, working\nthrough natural forces (e.g., gravity) is in fact consent to God, who\ncreated the natural world. Labor’s kenotic activity, as energy\nis expended daily, is a kind of imitatio Christi. \nHer social-political writings in London are markedly different from\nher early writings as an anarchist informed principally by Descartes,\nMarx, and Kant. While those influences remain, her later writings must\nbe read through the lens of her Christian Platonism. She suggests that\nwe must draw our spiritual life from our social environment. That is,\nwhile spirituality is individual vis-à-vis God, this\nspirituality occurs within a social context, namely, the collectivity,\nand principally, the nation. This is a reversal from the critical\ndistance she had maintained from the collectivity, especially in her\nearly emphasis on the individual’s methodical thinking. \nThroughout her life, Weil argued that knowledge in and of the world\ndemanded rigorous, balanced thinking, even if that difficulty and\nmeasurement led the thinker to near-impossible tasks. For her these\ntasks of thinking included, for instance, her attempting to synthesize\nperspectives of intricate Catholic doctrine on the threshold of the\nChurch with wisdom from various traditions such as ancient Greek\nphilosophy and tragedies, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism. Following\nAeschylus, she believed knowledge was gained through suffering. Shaped\nby her social-political and religious thought, Weil’s\nepistemology would change over time, especially in light of her\nmystical experiences, of her first-person contacts with God. \nIn her dissertation, Weil attempts to think with Descartes in order to\nfind foundational knowledge. Like Descartes, she argues for the\nexistence of self, God, and world. Her cogito, however, was a\ndecisive break from his: “I can, therefore I am” (Je\npuis, donc je suis) (1929–1930 “Science and\nPerception in Descartes”, FW 59). The self has the power of\nfreedom, Weil argues, but something else—the omnipotent,\nGod—makes the self realize that it is not all-powerful.\nSelf-knowledge, then, is capability always qualified by the\nacknowledgment that one is not God. She maintained a kind of Cartesian\nepistemology during her time as a teacher, early in her academic life.\nIn Lectures on Philosophy (1978 LP), a collection of lecture\nnotes taken by one of her students during the academic year\n1933–1934 at a girl’s lycée in Roanne, we\nfind that Weil is initially critical of sensations as grounds for\nknowledge, and thereby critical of empiricist epistemology (LP\n43–47). \nFrom her early writings onward she was to problematize the imagination\nas the “folle imagination”, a barrier between\nmind and reality, meaning that the human knower is kept from\nthings-in-themselves. Weil’s epistemology, then, informed by her\ninitial studies of Descartes, would take on inflections of Kant and\nPlato while positioning her against Aristotle. She was critical of any\nsensation that universalizes one’s reading of the world, and she\nsaw the imagination as thus extending the self, because it could not\nhelp but think through its own categories, wishes, and desires,\nthereby reading the world on its own terms. Relatedly, Weil would\ndevelop an intersubjective epistemology. Knowing the truth requires\nnot extending one’s own limited perspective, but suspending or\nabandoning it such that reality—including the reality of the\nexistence of others—could appear on its own terms. This\nsuspension involves a practice of epistemic humility and openness to\nall ideas; intelligence for Weil demands the qualified use of\nlanguage, acknowledgement of degrees, proportions, contingencies, and\nrelations, as well as an ability to call the self into question. These\nepistemic practices are part of a broader recognition that the\nindividual knower is limited. \nThe progression of Weil’s epistemology can be seen first in her\nconceptualization of contradiction. By Lectures on\nPhilosophy, she affirmed a sense of contradiction beyond the\nlogical conjunction “a is b” and\n“a is not-b”. Indeed, she argues that\ncontradiction can be a generative obstacle in that it requires the\nmind to expand its thinking in order to transcend the obstacle.\nDrawing on the mathematics of Eudoxus, she elaborates on this notion\nto claim that incommensurables can be reconciled when set on a kind of\n“higher plane”. This is not, however, a type of Hegelian\nsynthesis that can be intellectually apprehended. Instead, the\ncontemplation of contradictions can lead the knower to a higher\ncontemplation of truth-as-mystery. Thus, in her late epistemology Weil\npresents this concept of “mystery” as a certain kind of\ncontradiction in which incommensurables appear linked in an\nincomprehensible unity. \nMystery, as a conceptualization of contradiction, carries theological,\nor at least supernatural, implications. For instance, if contradiction\nis understood through formal logic, then the existence of affliction\nwould seemingly prove the nonexistence of an omnipotent, wholly\nbenevolent God; however, contradiction, understood as mystery, can\nitself serve as a mediation, allowing for the coexistence of\naffliction and God, seen most prominently on the Cross. Indeed, Christ\nis the religious solution to Weil’s principal contradiction,\nthat between the necessary and the good. Moreover, through incarnation\nthat opens onto universality, Christ also manifests and solves the\ncontradiction of the individual and the collectivity. Thus, in a\nmodification of the Pythagorean idea of harmony, she claims that\nChrist allows for “the just balance of contraries”\n(“Spiritual Autobiography”, WFG 33). More broadly, in her\n1941 “The Pythagorean Doctrine”, she argues that\nmathematics are a bridge between the natural and eternal (or between\nhumans and God). That is, the Pythagoreans held an intellectual\nsolution to apparent natural contradictions. Inspired by Pythagoras,\nshe claimed that the very study of mathematics can be a means of\npurification if light of the principles of proportion and the\nnecessary balancing of contraries—especially in geometry. She\nsaw in the Pythagorean legacy and spirit a link between their\nmathematical insights and their distinctly religious project to\npenetrate the mysteries of the cosmos. \nAs opposed to the suppression or dissolution of contradictions, as in\nsystematic philosophy, in Weil’s value-centered philosophy\ncontradictions are to be presented honestly and tested on different\nlevels; for her, they are “the criterion of the real” and\ncorrespond with the orientation of detachment (GG 98). For example,\nChrist’s imperative to “love your enemies” contains\na contradiction in value: love those who are detestable and who\nthreaten the vulnerability of loving. For Weil, submitting to this\nunion of contraries loosens one’s attachments to particular,\nego-driven perspectives and enables a “well-developed\nintellectual pluralism” (Springsted 2010: 97). She writes,\n“An attachment to a particular thing can only be destroyed by an\nattachment which is incompatible with it” (GG 101). With these\nphilosophical moves in mind, Robert Chenavier argues that she has not\na philosophy of perception, a phenomenology, but rather, borrowing\nGaston Bachelard’s phrase, a “dynamology of\ncontradiction” (Chenavier 2009 [2012: 25]). \nOverall, Weil’s presentation of contradiction is more\nPythagorean or Platonic than it is Marxian: it takes up contradiction\nnot through resolution on the level of things, but through dialectics\non the level of thought, where mystery is the beginning and end-point\nof thought (Springsted 2010: 97). In her unfinished essay “Is\nThere a Marxist Doctrine?”, from her time in London, Weil\nwrites,  \nContradiction in matter is imaged by the clash of forces coming from\ndifferent directions. Marx purely and simply attributed to social\nmatter this movement towards the good through contradictions, which\nPlato described as being that of the thinking creature drawn upwards\nby the supernatural operation of grace. (OL 180)  \nShe follows the Greek usage of “dialectics” to consider\n“the virtue of contradiction as support for the soul drawn\nupwards by grace”; Marx errs, she thought, in coupling such a\nmovement with “materialism” (OL 181). \nA second central epistemological concept for Weil is\n“reading” (lecture). Reading is a kind\nof interpretation of what is presented to knowers by both their\nphysical sensations and their social conditions; therefore,\nreading—as the reception and attribution of certain meanings in\nthe world—is always mediated. In turn, readings are mediated\nthrough other readings, since our perception of meaning is undoubtedly\ninvolved in and affected by an intersubjective web of interpretations.\nWeil explains this through the metaphor, borrowed from Descartes, of a\nblind man’s stick. We can read a situation through attention to\nanother in order to expand our awareness and sensitivity, just as the\nblind man enlarges his sensibility through the use of his stick. But\nour readings of the world can also become more narrow and simplistic,\nas for instance, when a context of violence and force tempts us to see\neveryone we encounter as a potential threat. Moreover, readings are\nnot free from power dynamics and can become projects of imposition and\nintervention; here her epistemology connects to her social-political\nphilosophy, specifically to her concept of force.  \nWe read, but also we are read by, others. Interferences in these\nreadings. Forcing someone to read himself as we read him (slavery).\nForcing others to read us as we read ourselves (conquest). (NB 43)\n \nShe connects reading to war and imagination: “War is a way of\nimposing another reading of sensations, a pressure upon the\nimagination of others” (NB 24). In her 1941 “Essay on the\nConcept of Reading” (LPW 21–27) Weil elaborates,\n“War, politics, eloquence, art, teaching, all action on others\nessentially consists in changing what they read” (LPW 26). In\nthe same essay she develops “reading” in relation to the\naforementioned epistemological concepts of appearance, the empirical\nworld, and contradiction: \n[A]t each instant of our life we are gripped from the outside, as it\nwere, by meanings that we ourselves read in appearances. That is why\nwe can argue endlessly about the reality of the external world, since\nwhat we call the world are the meanings that we read; they are not\nreal. But they seize us as if they were external; that is real. Why\nshould we try to resolve this contradiction when the more important\ntask of thought in this world is to define and contemplate insoluble\ncontradictions, which, as Plato said, draw us upwards? (LPW 22) \nIt is important to note that for Weil, we are not simply passive in\nour readings. That is, we can learn to change our readings of the\nworld or of others. An elevated transformation in reading, however,\ndemands an apprenticeship in loving God through the things of this\nworld—a kind of attentiveness that will also entail certain\nbodily involvements, labors, postures, and experiences. Particular\nreadings result from particular ways of living. Ideally for her, we\nwould read the natural as illuminated by the supernatural. This\nconceptualization of reading involves recognition on hierarchical\nlevels, as she explains in her notebooks:  \nTo read necessity behind sensation, to read order behind necessity, to\nread God behind order. We must love all facts, not for their\nconsequences, but because in each fact God is there present. But that\nis tautological. To love all facts is nothing else than to read God in\nthem. (NB 267)  \nThus the world is known as a kind of text featuring several\nsignifications on several stages, levels, or domains. \nWeil’s epistemology grounds her critique of modern science. In\nThe Need for Roots she advocates for a science conducted\n“according to methods of mathematical precision, and at the same\ntime maintained in close relationship with religious faith” (NR\n288). Through contemplation of the natural world via this kind of\nscience, the world could be read on multiple levels. The knower,\nreading thus, would understand that the order of the world is the same\nas a unity, but different on its myriad levels:  \nwith respect to God [it] is eternal Wisdom; with respect to the\nuniverse, perfect obedience; with respect to our love, beauty; with\nrespect to our intelligence, balance of necessary relations; with\nrespect to our flesh, brute force. (NR 288–289)  \nAs in her social-political thought, in her epistemology Weil is a kind\nof anti-modern. She sees modern science and epistemology as a project\nof self-expansion that forgets limit and thinks the world should be\nsubject to human power and autonomy. Labor (especially physical labor,\nsuch as farming), then, also assumes an epistemological role for her.\nBy heteronomously subjecting the individual to necessity on a daily\nbasis, it at once contradicts self-aggrandizement and allows for a\nmore balanced reading: the intelligence qualifies itself as it reads\nnecessary relations simultaneously on multiple levels. This reading on\ndifferent levels, and inflected through faith, amounts to a kind of\nnon-reading, in that it is detached, impersonal and impartial. Through\nthese predicates “reading” is connected to her social\nthought, aesthetics, and religious philosophy. That is, in her later\nthought Weil’s epistemology relies on a time-out-of-mind\nmetaphysics for justification. Analogous to aesthetic taste, spiritual\ndiscernment—God-given and graceful—allows the abdicated\nself to read from a universal perspective at its most developed stage.\nThus, she argued, one can love equally and indiscriminately, just as\nthe sun shines or the rain falls without preference. \nWeil’s central ethical concept is “attention”\n(l’attention), which, though thematically and\npractically present in her early writings, reached its robust\ntheoretical expression while she was in Marseilles in 1942. Attention\nis a particular kind of ethical “turn” in her\nconceptualization. Fundamentally, it is less a moral position or\nspecific practice and more an orientation that nevertheless requires\nan arduous apprenticeship leading to a capacity of discernment on\nmultiple levels. This includes discerning what someone is going\nthrough in her or his suffering, the particular protest made by\nsomeone harmed, the social conditions that engender a climate for\nsuffering, and the fact that one is, by chance (hazard) at a\ndifferent moment, equally a subject of affliction. Attention is\ndirected not by will but by a particular kind of desire without an\nobject. It is not a “muscular effort” but a\n“negative effort” (WFG 61), involving release of egoistic\nprojects and desires and a growing receptivity of the mind. For Weil,\nas a Christian Platonist, the desire motivating attention is oriented\ntoward the mysterious good that “draws God down” (WFG 61).\nIn her essay “Reflections on the Right use of School Studies\nwith a View to the Love of God” (1942 in WFG 57–65), Weil\ntakes prayer, defined as “the orientation of all the attention\nof which the soul is capable toward God”, as her point of\ndeparture (WFG 57). She then describes a kind of vigilance in her\ndefinition of attention: \nAttention consists of suspending our thought, leaving it detached\n[disponible], empty [vide], and ready to be\npenetrated by the object; it means holding in our minds, within the\nreach of this thought, but on the lower level and not in contact with\nit, the diverse knowledge we have acquired which we are forced to make\nuse of. … Above all our thought should be empty\n[vide], waiting [en attente], not seeking anything\n[ne rien chercher], but ready to receive in its naked truth\nthe object that is to penetrate it. (WFG 62) \nThe French makes more clear the connection between attention\n(l’attention) and waiting (attente). For Weil\nthe problem with searching, instead of waiting en hupomene\n(δἰ ὑπομονῆς),\nis precisely that one is eager to fill the void characterizing\nattente. As a result, one settles too quickly on some-thing:\na counterfeit, falsity, idol. Because in searching or willing the\nimagination fills the void (le vide), it is crucial that\nattention be characterized by suspension and detachment. Indeed, the\nvoid by definition is empty (vide)—of idols, futural\nself-projections, consolations that compensate un-thinking, and\nattachments of collective and personal prestige. As such, its\nacceptance marks individual fragility and destructibility, that is,\nmortality. But this acceptance of death is the condition for the\npossibility of the reception of grace. (As explained below in regard\nto her religious philosophy, Weil’s concept for the disposition\ncharacterized by these features of attention, with obvious theological\nresonances, is “decreation”.) \nIn attention one renounces one’s ego in order to receive the\nworld without the interference of one’s limited and consumptive\nperspective. This posture of self-emptying, a stripping away of the\n“I” (dépouillement)—ultimately for\nWeil an imitatio Christi in its kenosis—allows for an\nimpersonal but intersubjective ethics. Indeed, if the primary\norientation of attention is toward a mysterious and unknown God (often\nexperienced as a desire for the Good), the secondary disposition is\ntoward another person, especially toward those going through\naffliction.  \nThe soul empties itself [se vide] of all its own contents in\norder to receive into itself the being it is looking at, just as he\nis, in all his truth. Only he who is capable of attention can do this.\n(WFG 65) \nWeil recognizes and problematizes the fact that the autonomous self\nnaturally imposes itself in its projects, as opposed to disposing\nitself to the other; for this reason, attention is rare but is\nrequired of any ethical disposition. The exemplary story of attention\nfor Weil is the parable of the Good Samaritan, in which, on her\nreading, compassion is exchanged when one individual “turns his\nattention toward” another individual, anonymous and afflicted\n(WFG 90). \nThe actions that follow are just the automatic effect of this moment\nof attention. The attention is creative. But at the moment when it is\nengaged it is a renunciation. This is true, at least, if it is pure.\nThe man accepts to be diminished by concentrating on an expenditure of\nenergy, which will not extend his own power but will only give\nexistence to a being other than himself, who will exist independently\nof him. (1942 “Forms of the Implicit Love of God” in WFG\n83–142, 90) \nAs such, attention not only gives human recognition and therefore\nmeaningful existence to another, but it also allows the individual\nengaged in renunciation to take up a moral stance in response to her\nor his desire for good. \nIt is important to distinguish Weil’s ethics of attention from\ncanonical conceptualizations of ethics. Attention is not motivated by\na duty (although Weil thinks we are obligated to respond to\nothers’ needs, whether of soul or body [see “Draft for a\nStatement of Human Obligations” in SWA, esp. 224–225]) or\nassessed by its consequences. In addition, through its sense of\nphronesis (practical wisdom), which Weil assumed from\nAristotle through Marx, attention is arguably closer to virtue ethics\nthan it is to deontology or consequentialism. However, it is separated\nfrom the tradition of virtue ethics in important ways: it often\nemerges more spontaneously than virtue, which, for Aristotle, is\ncultivated through habituation as it develops into a hexis;\nits emphasis on a “negative effort” suggests an\nactive-passive orientation that militates against Aristotle’s\nemphasis on activity (it is more a “turning” than a\n“doing”, more orientation than achievement); it is\nexcessive in its generosity, as opposed to being a mean,\ne.g., liberality; its supernatural inspiration contrasts with\nAristotle’s naturalism; it does not imply a teleology of\nrealizing one’s own virtuous projects—in fact, it is a\nsuspension of one’s own projects; finally, for Weil, Aristotle\nlacks a sense of the impersonal good toward which attention is\noriented (and in this respect she is, again, inspired by Plato). \nWeil treats the connections among attention, void, and love, relying\non her supernatural (Christian Platonic) metaphysics, in “Forms\nof the Implicit Love of God”. \nTo empty ourselves [Se vider] of our false divinity, to deny\nourselves, to give up being the center of the world in imagination, to\ndiscern that all points in the world are equally centers and that the\ntrue center is outside the world, this is to consent to the rule of\nmechanical necessity in matter and of free choice at the center of\neach soul. Such consent is love. The face of this love, which is\nturned toward thinking persons, is the love of our neighbor. (WFG\n100) \nAttention can be seen as love, for just as attention consents to the\nexistence of another, love requires the recognition of a reality\noutside of the self, and thus de-centers the self and its\nparticularity. Contra the colloquial sense of love, it is\nbecause we do not love personally, but “it is God in us who\nloves them [les malheureux]” (WFG 93–94), that\nour love for others is “quite impersonal” and thereby\nuniversal (WFG 130). Weil allows, however, “one legitimate\nexception to the duty of loving universally”, namely, friendship\n(“Last Thoughts”, WFG 51). Friendship is “a personal\nand human love which is pure and which enshrines an intimation and a\nreflection of divine love” (WFG 131), a “supernatural\nharmony, a union of opposites” (WFG 126). The opposites that\nform the miraculous harmony are necessity/subordination (i.e., drawing\nfrom Thucydides’ Melian dialogue, she sees it as an\nimpossibility for one to want to preserve autonomy in both oneself and\nanother; in the world the stronger exerts force through will) and\nliberty/equality (which is maintained through the desire of each\nfriend to preserve the consent of oneself and of the other, a consent\nto be “two and not one” [WFG 135]). In other words, in\nfriendship a particular, self-founded reading of the other is not\nforced. Distance is maintained, and in this way Weil’s concept\nof friendship advances her previous critiques of the ethos of\ncapitalism, bureaucracy, and colonialism—i.e., free consent of\nall parties is the essential ingredient of all human relations that\nare not degraded or abusive. Hence friendship is a model for ethics\nmore generally—even, contra her claim, universally.\n \nFriendship has something universal about it. It consists of loving a\nhuman being as we should like to be able to love each soul in\nparticular of all those who go to make up the human race. (WFG\n135) \nWeil’s ethics of attention informs her later social-political\nphilosophy and epistemology. In relation to her social-political\nthought, attention suspends the self to allow for supernatural\njustice, which involves simultaneously turning attention to God and to\naffliction. Justice and the love of the neighbor are not distinct, for\nher. \nOnly the absolute identification of justice and love makes the\ncoexistence possible of compassion and gratitude on the one hand, and\non the other, of respect for the dignity of affliction\n[malheur] in the afflicted—a respect felt by the\nsufferer himself [les malheureux par lui-même] and the\nothers. (WFG 85) \nAdditionally, attention, in its consent to distance from and autonomy\nof the other, is an antidote to force. Important to Weil’s\nepistemology, attention militates against readings that are based on\nimagination, unexamined perceptions, or functions of the collectivity\n(e.g., prestige). Attention here manifests as independent, detached\nthought. In its religious valence involving obedience and consent,\nattention also bears on Weil’s epistemology in an additional\nway: it suggests that knowing the reality of the world is less an\nindividual achievement or attainment of mastery and more a gift of\ngrace—openness to what cannot be predicted and to what often\ntakes us by surprise. To moral gravity, the natural tendency of humans\ntoward expansion of self and injustice, grace inspires attention as an\nantidote. \nAlthough the metaphysics of Weil’s later thought was both\nChristian and Platonic, and therefore graceful and supernatural, her\nturn to God occurred not despite but, rather, because of her attention\nto reality and contact with the world. It is not the case, then, that\nher spiritual turn and “theological commitment”\n(Springsted 2015: 1–2) severed her contact with her early materialism,\nsolidarities, or Marxian considerations; rather, her spiritual turn\noccurred within this context, which would ground the religious\nphilosophy she would subsequently articulate. \nIn her late thought Weil presents an original creation theology. God,\nas purely good, infinite, and eternal, withdrew (or reduced Godself)\nso that something else (something less than fully good, finite, and\nspatio-temporally determinate) could exist, namely, the universe.\nImplicit in this outside-of-God universe is a contingency of forces.\nShe calls this principle of contingency, the “web of\ndeterminations” (McCullough 2014: 124) contrary to God,\n“necessity”. Necessity is “the screen”\n(l’écran) placed between God and creatures. Here\nher creation metaphysics echoes Plato’s distinction between the\nnecessary and the good in the Timaeus. Her Christian\ninflection translates this to the “supreme contradiction”\nbetween creature and creator; “it is Christ who represents the\nunity of these contradictories” (NB 386). \nWeil is clear that God and the world is less than God alone, yet that\nonly heightens the meaning of God’s abdication. That is, out of\nlove (for what would be the world and the creatures therein), God\ndecided to be lesser. Because existence—God’s very denial\nof Godself—is itself a mark of God’s love, providence is\ntherefore not found in particular interventions of God, but understood\nby recognizing the universe in all its contingency as the sum of\nGod’s intentions. In this theology rests an implication for\ncreatures. If humans are to imitate God, then they must also renounce\ntheir autonomy (including imagined “centeredness” in the\nuniverse) and power out of love for God and therefore the world; she\ncalls this “decreation”\n(décréation), which she describes paradoxically\nby “passive activity” (WFG 126) and, drawing on her\nreadings of the Bhagavad Gita, “non-active\naction” (NB 124). \nWeil articulates her religious philosophy through a series of\ndistinctions—of oppositions or contradictions. It is important\nto read the distinctions she makes not as positing dualisms, but as\nsuggesting contraries that are, unsynthesized, themselves mediations\nthrough which the soul is drawn upward. Her concept of\n“intermediaries”—or metaxu\n(μεταξύ), the Greek term she employs in\nher notebooks—becomes explicit beginning in 1939. Through\nmetaxu God is indirectly present in the world, specifically,\nfor example, in beauty, cultural traditions, law, and labor—all\nof which place us into contact with reality. In terms of her\nperiodization, her concept of mediation moved from relations of mind\nand matter on the level of the natural (found in the early Weil) to a\nmediation relating the natural intelligence to attention and love on\nthe level of the supernatural (at work in the late Weil), thus\nencompassing her early view through a universal perspective. \nGiven that reality is itself metaxu, Weil’s late\nconcept of mediation is more universal than the aforementioned\nspecific examples suggest. For her the real (le réel)\nitself is an obstacle that represents contradiction, an obstacle felt,\ne.g., in a difficult idea, in the presence of another, or in physical\nlabor; thus thought comes into contact with necessity and must\ntransform contradiction into correlation or mysterious and crucifying\nrelation, resulting in spiritual edification. Her explanation of this\nmediation is based on her idiosyncratic cosmology, especially its\nparadoxical claim that what is often painful reality, as distance from\nGod, is also, as intermediate, connection to God. She illustrates this\nclaim with the following metaphor: \nTwo prisoners whose cells adjoin communicate with each other by\nknocking on the wall. The wall is the thing which separates them but\nit is also their means of communication. It is the same with us and\nGod. Every separation is a link. (GG 145) \nIn developing her concept of the real, Weil is at pains to distinguish\nit from the imaginary. The imagination—problematized on\nepistemological grounds in her early thought—is criticized once\nagain in her religious philosophy for its insidious tendency to pose\nfalse consolations that at once invite idolatry or self-satisfaction,\nboth of which obviate real contemplation. This is why decreation, in\nwhich the individual withdraws her or his “I” and personal\nperspective so as to allow the real and others to give themselves, is\ncrucial not only spiritually, but also epistemologically and\nethically. It is, additionally and more radically, why Weil suggests\nthat atheism can be a kind of purification insofar as it negates\nreligious consolation that fills the void. For those for whom religion\namounts to an imagined “God who smiles on [them]” (GG 9),\natheism represents a necessary detachment. Crucially, for her, love is\npure not in the name of a personal God or its particular image, but\nonly when anonymous and universal. \nThe real leads us back to the aforementioned concept of\n“necessity”, for reality—essentially determinate,\nlimited, contingent, and conditional—is itself a “network\nof necessity” (Vetö 1971 [1994: 90]), such that necessity\nis a reflection of reality. Moreover, like “power” in her\nearly period and “force” in her middle period,\nWeil’s concept of necessity includes not only the physical\nforces of the created world, but also the social forces of human life.\nThrough necessity a sense of slavery remains in her thought, for\nhumans are ineluctably subject to necessity. In this way, enslavement\nto forces outside our control is essentially woven into the human\ncondition. \nTime, contrary to God as eternal, and along with space and matter, is\nfirst of all the most basic form of necessity. In its constant\nreminder of distance from God, and in the experience of enduring, and\nwaiting, time is also painful. Weil’s Christian Platonism comes\nto light in the two most poignant metaphors she uses to refer to time,\nnamely, the (Platonic) Cave and the (Christian) Cross. In both cases,\ntime is the weight or the pull of necessity, through which the soul,\nin any effort of the self, feels vulnerable, contingent, and\nunavoidably subject to necessity’s mediation here below\n(ici-bas). Time, then, is both the Cave where the self\npursues its illusory goals of expansion in the future and the Cross\nwhere necessity, a sign of God’s love, pins the self, suffering\nand mortal, to the world. \nImportantly, by 1942 in New York, Weil’s concept of time sides\nwith Plato against what she sees as Christian emphasis on\nprogress: \nChristianity was responsible for bringing this notion of progress,\npreviously unknown, into the world; and this notion, become the bane\nof the modern world, has de-Christianized it. We must abandon the\nnotion. We must get rid of our superstition of chronology in order to\nfind Eternity. (LPr 29) \nFor Weil progress does not carry normative implications of\nimprovement, for the Good is eternal and non-existent (in that it is\nneither spatial nor temporal); time must be consented to and suffered,\nnot fled. As for Christ on the cross, for creatures there is\nredemption not from but through suffering. She thus presents a\nsupernatural use of, not a remedy for, affliction. One form of sin,\nthen, is an attempt to escape time, for only God is time-out-of-mind.\nHowever, time, paradoxically, can also serve as metaxu. While\nmonotony is dreadful and fatiguing when it is in the form of a\npendulum’s swinging or a factory’s work, it is beautiful\nas a reflection of eternity, in the form of a circle (which unites\nbeing and becoming) or the sound of Gregorian chant. This beauty of\nthe world suggests, when read from the detached perspective, order\nbehind necessity, and God behind order.  \nA second form of necessity is “gravity”\n(pesanteur), as distinct from supernatural\n“grace”. If gravity signifies the forces of the natural\nworld that subject all created beings physically, materially, and\nsocially, and thus functions as a downward “pull” on the\n“turn” of attention to God and to the afflicted,\n“grace”, as a counter-balance, is the motivation by and\ngoodness of God. Grace pierces the world of necessity and serves to\norient, harmonize, and balance, thus providing a kind of\n“supernatural bread” for satiating the human void. Grace,\nentering the empirical world, disposes one to be purified by\ndetachment, waiting for a good that is real but that could never\n“exist” in a material sense (i.e., as subject to time,\nchange, force, etc.). For Weil, natural/necessary gravity (force) and\nsupernatural/spiritual grace (justice) are the two fundamental aspects\nof the created world, coming together most prominently in the\ncrucifixion. The shape of the cross itself reflects this intersection\nof the horizontal (necessity) and the vertical (grace). \nWeil’s concept of necessity bears on her late conceptualization\nof the subject. She connects seeing oneself as central to the world to\nseeing oneself as exempt from necessity. From this perspective, if\nsomething were to befall oneself, then the world would cease to have\nimportance; therefore, the assertive and willful self concludes,\nnothing could befall oneself. Affliction contradicts this perspective\nand thus forcefully de-centers the self. Unlike her existentialist\ncontemporaries such as Sartre, Weil did not think human freedom\nprincipally through agency; for late Weil, humans are free not\nontologically as a presence-to-self but supernaturally through\nobedience and consent. More than obedience, consent is the unity of\nnecessity in matter with freedom in creatures. A creature cannot\nnot obey; the only choice for the intelligent creature is to\ndesire or not to desire the good. The former—and here her\nstoicism through Marcus Aurelius and Spinoza emerges in her own appeal\nto amor fati—is a disposition that implies a consent to\nnecessity and a love of the order of the world, both of which mean\naccepting divine will. Consent, therefore, is a kind of reconciliation\nin her dialectic between the necessary and the good. Consent does not\nfollow from effort or will; rather, it expresses an ontological\nstatus, namely, decreation. In supernatural compassion one loves\nthrough evil: through distance (space) and through monotony\n(time), attending in a void and thinking freedom through\nnecessity—through the abdication of God. Thus, in regard to\ncontradiction and mediation, just as the intelligence must grapple\nwith mystery in Weil’s epistemology, so too love must be\nvulnerable and defenseless in the face of evil in her metaphysical and\nreligious philosophy. \nWeil’s metaphysic sheds light on her aesthetic philosophy, which\nis primarily Kantian and Platonic. For Weil beauty is a snare\n(à la Homer) set by God, trapping the soul so that God\nmight enter it. Necessity presents itself not only in gravity, time,\nand affliction, but also in beauty. The contact of impersonal good\nwith the faculty of sense is beauty; contact of evil with the faculty\nof sense is ugliness and suffering—both are contact with the\nreal, necessary, and providential.  \nWeil is a realist in regard to aesthetics in that she uses the\nlanguage of being gripped or grasped by beauty, which weaves, as it\nwere, a link among mind, body, world, and universe. Woven through the\nworld, but beyond relying simply on the individual’s mind or\nsenses, beauty, in this linking, lures and engenders awareness of\nsomething outside of the self. In paradoxical terms, for Weil,\nfollowing Kant, the aesthetic experience can be characterized as a\ndisinterested interestedness; against Kant, her telos of such\nexperience is Platonic, namely, to orient the soul to the\ncontemplation of the good. Moreover, for Weil beauty is purposive only\nbecause it is derivative of the good, i.e., the order of the world is\na function of God. In a revision of Kant’s line that beauty is a\nfinality without finality, then, she sees beauty not only as a kind of\nfeeling or presence of finality, but also as a gesture toward,\ninclination to, or promise of supernatural, transcendental\ngoodness. \nAt the same time, Weil’s concept of beauty is not only informed\nby her Platonism and thus marked by eternity, but it is also inspired\nby her experiences with Christ and hence features a kind of\nincarnation: the ideal can become a reality in the world. As such,\nbeauty is a testament to and manifestation of the balance or\nequilibrium of the network of inflexible necessity that is the natural\nworld—a network that, in some sense, the intelligence can grasp.\nIt is in this way—not as an ontological category but, rather, as\na sensible experience—that through beauty necessity becomes the\nobject of love (i.e., in Kantian terms, beauty is regulative, not\nconstitutive). Thus beauty is metaxu attracting the soul to\nGod, and as metaxu, beauty serves as a “locus of\nincommensurability” (Winch 1989: 173) between the fragile\ncontingency of time (change, becoming, death) and an eternal\nreality. \nBecause beauty is the order of the world as necessity, strictly\nspeaking (and like Weil’s conception of providence) it is\nuniversal; “beauty” applies principally to the world as a\nwhole, and therefore consent to beauty must be total. Thus it\nfunctions as an “implicit love of God” [see WFG 99]. More\nspecifically, on the level of the particular there are, secondarily,\ntypes of beauty that nevertheless demonstrate balance, order,\nproportion, and thus their divine provenance (e.g., those found in\nnature, art, and science). \nOne’s recognition of the beauty/order of the world has\nimplications, once again, for the subject. Because beauty is to be\ncontemplated at a distance and in consent, not consumed through the\ngreedy will, it trains the soul to be detached in the face of\nsomething irreducible, and in this sense it is similar to affliction.\nBoth de-center the self and demand a posture of waiting\n(attente). Contemplating beauty, then, means transcending the\nperspective of one’s own project. Because beauty, as external to\nself, is to be consented to, it implies both that one’s reality\nis limited and that one does not want to change the object of her/his\nmode of engagement. Furthermore, beauty has an element of the\nimpersonal coming into contact with a person. Real interaction with\nbeauty is decreative. True to this claim, Weil’s aesthetic\ncommitments are reflected in her style: in her sharp prose she\nscrutinizes her own thought while tending to exclude her own voice and\navoid personal references; thus she performs “the linguistic\ndecreation of the self” (Dargan 1999: 7). \nAlthough the French post-structuralists who succeeded Weil did not\nengage extensively with her thought, her concepts carry a legacy\nthrough her contemporaries domestically and her heirs internationally\n(see Rozelle-Stone 2017). In regard to her generation of French\nthinkers, the influence of “attention” can be seen in the\nwritings of Maurice Blanchot; her Platonic sense of good, order, and\nclarity was taken up—and rejected—by both Georges Bataille\nand Emmanuel Levinas. Following Weil’s generation, in his\nyounger years Jacques Derrida took interest in her mysticism and,\nspecifically, her purifying atheism, only to leave her behind almost\nentirely in his later references (Baring 2011). It is possible that\nWeil’s limited influence on poststructuralists is derived not\nonly from the fact that she was not influenced by Nietzsche and\nHeidegger to the extent of the four aforementioned French thinkers,\nbut also, quite simply, because she did not survive World War II and\nhence did not write thereafter. It is also important to note that\nthroughout her life, Weil’s status as a female philosopher\ncontributed to ad hominem attacks against her person, not her\nthought; she was often perceived as “psychologically cold”\nas opposed to being engaged in “an ethical project with\ndifferent assumptions” (Nelson 2017: 9). \nAcross Europe and more recently, Weil’s “negative\npolitics”—that is, turning away from institutions and\nideology and toward religious reflection—, in conjunction with\nMichel Foucault’s concept of biopolitics, has been taken up by\nthe political philosophies of Giorgio Agamben and Roberto Esposito\n(Ricciardi 2009). In doing so, Agamben (who wrote his dissertation on\nWeil’s political thought and critique of personhood, ideas of\nwhich went on to shape Homo Sacer [see Agamben 2017]) and\nEsposito rely on Weil’s concepts of decreation, impersonality,\nand force. Beyond the Continental scene, her Christian\nPlatonism—especially her concepts of the good, justice, void,\nand attention—influenced Iris Murdoch’s emphasis on the\ngood, metaphysics, and morality, and was thereby part of a recent\nrevival in virtue ethics (Crisp & Slote 1997). The legacy of\nWeil’s writings on affliction and beauty in relation to justice\nis also felt in Elaine Scarry’s writings on aesthetics (Scarry\n1999). T. S. Eliot, who wrote the introduction to The Need for\nRoots, cites Weil as an inspiration of his literature, as do W.\nH. Auden, Czeslaw Milosz, Seamus Heaney, Flannery O’Connor,\nSusan Sontag, and Anne Carson. \nIn Anglo-American academic consideration, Weil scholarship has\nemphasized her concept of supernatural justice, including the\nphilosophical tensions that inform her materialism and mysticism\n(Winch 1989; Dietz 1988; Bell 1993, 1998; Rhees 2000). Additional considerations treat her\nChristian Platonism (Springsted 1983; Doering & Springsted 2004).\nRecent English-language scholarship on Weil has included texts on her\nconcept of force (Doering 2010), her radicalism (Rozelle-Stone &\nStone 2010), and the relationship in her thought between science and\ndivinity (Morgan 2005), between suffering and trauma (Nelson 2017),\nand between decreation and ethics (Cha 2017). Furthermore, her concepts\nhave influenced recent contributions to questions of identity (Cameron\n2007), political theology (Lloyd 2011), and animality (Pick 2011).","contact.mail":"benjamin.palmer.davis@emory.edu","contact.domain":"emory.edu"}]
