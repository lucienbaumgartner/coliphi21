The puzzles in Book One prepare for\nthis question, and Glaucon and Adeimantus make it explicit at the\nbeginning of Book Two. To answer the question, Socrates takes a long\nway around, sketching an account of a good city on the grounds that a\ngood city would be just and that defining justice as a virtue of a\ncity would help to define justice as a virtue of a human being.\nSocrates is finally close to answering the question after he\ncharacterizes justice as a personal virtue at the end of Book Four,\nbut he is interrupted and challenged to defend some of the more\ncontroversial features of the good city he has sketched. In Books Five\nthrough Seven, he addresses this challenge, arguing (in effect) that\nthe just city and the just human being as he has sketched them are in\nfact good and are in principle possible. After this long digression,\nSocrates in Books Eight and Nine finally delivers three\n“proofs” that it is always better to be just than\nunjust. Then, because Socrates wants not only to show that it is\nalways better to be just but also to convince Glaucon and Adeimantus\nof this point, and because Socrates’ proofs are opposed by the\nteachings of poets, he bolsters his case in Book Ten by indicting the\npoets’ claims to represent the truth and by offering a new myth that\nis consonant with his proofs.\n\n\n\nAs this overview makes clear, the center of Plato’s Republic\nis a contribution to ethics: a discussion of what the virtue justice \nis and why a person should be just. Yet because Socrates links his \ndiscussion of personal justice to an account of justice in the city \nand makes claims about how good and bad cities are arranged, the \nRepublic sustains reflections on political questions, as \nwell. Not that ethics and politics exhaust the concerns of the \nRepublic. The account in Books Five through Seven of how a \njust city and a just person are in principle possible is an account \nof how knowledge can rule, which includes discussion of what \nknowledge and its objects are. Moreover, the indictment of the poets \ninvolves a wide-ranging discussion of art. This article, however, \nfocuses on the ethics and politics of Plato’s Republic. For \nmore on what the Republic says about knowledge and its \nobjects, see \n Plato: middle period metaphysics and epistemology,\n and for more about the discussion of the poets, see \n Plato: rhetoric and poetry.\n \n\n\n\nThis article attempts to provide a constructive guide to the main \nissues of ethics and politics in the Republic. Two \nassumptions shape its organization. First, it assumes that an account\nof ethics and politics in the Republic requires a \npreliminary understanding of the question Socrates is facing and the \nstrategy Socrates uses to answer the question. Second, it assumes \nthat politics in the Republic is based upon the moral \npsychology in the Republic, and thus that the former is more\nprofitably discussed after the latter. With these assumptions in \nplace, the following outline unfolds:\n\n\n\nIn Book One, the Republic’s question first emerges in the \nfigure of Cephalus. After Socrates asks his host what it is like \nbeing old (328d–e) and rich (330d)—rather rude, we might \nthink—Cephalus says that the best thing about wealth is that it can \nsave us from being unjust and thus smooth the way for an agreeable \nafterlife (330d–331b). This is enough to prompt more questions, for \nSocrates wants to know what justice is. Predictably, Cephalus and \nthen Polemarchus fail to define justice in a way that survives \nSocratic examination, but they continue to assume that justice is a \nvaluable part of a good human life. Thrasymachus erupts when he has \nhad his fill of this conversation (336a–b), and he challenges the \nassumption that it is good to be just. On Thrasymachus’ view (see \nespecially 343c–344c), justice is conventionally established by the \nstrong, in order that the weak will serve the interests of the \nstrong. The strong themselves, on this view, are better off \ndisregarding justice and serving their own interests directly. \n\nSocrates sees in this “immoralist” challenge the explicit\nquestion of whether one should live a just or unjust life (344d–e),\nand he tries repeatedly to repel Thrasymachus’ onslaught. (See the entry on \n Callicles and Thrasymachus.) Eventually,\nThrasymachus withdraws sullenly, like Callicles in\nthe Gorgias, but Socrates’ “victory” fails to\nsatisfy Glaucon and Adeimantus. The brothers pick up where\nThrasymachus left off, providing reasons why most people think that\njustice is not intrinsically valuable but worth respecting only if one\nis not strong enough (or invisible enough) to get away with\ninjustice. They want to be shown that most people are wrong, that\njustice is worth choosing for its own sake.  More than that, Glaucon\nand Adeimantus want to be shown that justice is worth\nchoosing regardless of the rewards or penalties bestowed on\nthe just by other people and the gods, and they will accept this\nconclusion only if Socrates can convince them that it is\nalways better to be just. So Socrates must persuade them \nthat the just person who is terrifically unfortunate and scorned \nlives a better life than the unjust person who is so successful that \nhe is unfairly rewarded as if he were perfectly just (see 360d–361d). \n\nThe challenge that Glaucon and Adeimantus present has baffled modern \nreaders who are accustomed to carving up ethics into deontologies \nthat articulate a theory of what is right independent of what is good\nand consequentialisms that define what is right in terms of what \npromotes the good (Foster 1937, Mabbott 1937, cf. Prichard 1912 and 1928). The insistence that justice be praised “itself by \nitself” has suggested to some that Socrates will be offering a \ndeontological account of justice. But the insistence that justice be \nshown to be beneficial to the just has suggested to others that \nSocrates will be justifying justice by reference to its consequences. \n\nIn fact, both readings are distortions, predicated more on what modern\nmoral philosophers think than on what Plato thinks. Socrates takes the\nbasic challenge to concern how justice relates to the just person’s\nobjective success or happiness (Greek eudaimonia). In Book\nOne, he argued that justice, as a virtue, makes the soul perform its\nfunction well and that a person who lives well is “blessed and\nhappy” (352d–354a, quoting 354a1). At the beginning of Book Two,\nhe retains his focus on the person who aims to be happy. He says,\n“I think that justice belongs in the best class [of goods], that\nwhich should be loved both for its own sake and for the sake of its\nconsequences by anyone who is going to be blessed”\n(358a1–3). Given this perspective, Socrates has to show that smartly\npursuing one’s happiness favors being just (which requires always\nacting justly) over being unjust (which tolerates temptation to\ninjustice and worse), apart from the consequences that attend to the\nappearance of being just or unjust. But he does not have to show that\nbeing just or acting justly brings about happiness. The\nfunction argument in Book One suggests that acting justly is the same\nas being happy. If Socrates stands by this identity, he can\nsimultaneously show that justice is valuable “itself by\nitself” and that the just are happier. \n\nBut the function argument concludes that justice is both necessary \nand sufficient for happiness (354a), and this is a considerably \nstronger thesis than the claim that the just are always happier than \nthe unjust. After the challenge Glaucon and Adeimantus present, \nSocrates might not be so bold. Even if he successfully maintains that acting justly is identical to being happy, he might think that there are circumstances in which no just person could act justly and thus be happy. This will nonetheless satisfy Glaucon and \nAdeimantus if the just are better off (that is, closer to happy) than\nthe unjust in these circumstances. (See also Kirwan 1965 and Irwin 1999.) \n\nAfter the challenge of Glaucon and Adeimantus, Socrates takes off in \na strange direction (from 367e). He suggests looking for justice as a\nvirtue of cities before defining justice as a virtue of persons, on \nthe unconvincing grounds that justice in a city is bigger and more \napparent than justice in a person (368c–369b), and this leads \nSocrates to a rambling description of some features of a good city \n(369b–427c). This may seem puzzling. But Socrates’ indirect approach \nis not unmotivated. The arguments of Book One and the challenge of \nGlaucon and Adeimantus rule out several more direct routes. \n\nFirst, Socrates might have tried to settle quickly on a widely \naccepted account of what justice is and moved immediately to \nconsidering whether that is always in one’s interests. But \nBook One rules this strategy out by casting doubt on widely accepted \naccounts of justice. Socrates must say what justice is in order to \nanswer the question put to him, and what he can say is constrained in\nimportant ways. Most obviously, he cannot define justice as happiness\nwithout begging the question. But he also must give an account of \njustice that his interlocutors recognize as justice: if his \naccount of justice were to require torturing red-headed children \nfor amusement, he would fail to address the question that Glaucon and\nAdeimantus are asking. \n\nMoreover, Socrates cannot try to define justice by enumerating the \ntypes of action that justice requires or forbids. We might have \nobjected to this strategy for this reason: because action-types can \nbe specified in remarkably various ways and at remarkably different \nlevels of specificity, no list of just or unjust action-types could \nbe comprehensive. But a specific argument in Book One suggests a \ndifferent reason why Socrates does not employ this strategy. When \nCephalus characterizes justice as keeping promises and returning what\nis owed, Socrates objects by citing a case in which returning what is\nowed would not be just (331c). This objection potentially has very \nwide force, as it seems that exceptions could always be \nfound for any action-type that does not include in its description a \nword like ‘wrong’ or ‘just’. Wrongful killing\nmay always be wrong, but is killing? Just recompense may always be \nright, but is recompense? \n\nSo Book One makes it difficult for Socrates to take justice for\ngranted. What is worse, the terms in which Socrates accepts the\nchallenge of Glaucon and Adeimantus make it difficult for him to take\nhappiness for granted. If Socrates were to proceed like a\nconsequentialist, he might offer a full account of happiness and then\ndeliver an account of justice that both meets with general approval\nand shows how justice brings about happiness. But Socrates does not\nproceed like that. He does not even do as much as Aristotle does in\nthe Nicomachean Ethics; he does not suggest some general\ncriteria for what happiness is. He proceeds as if happiness is\nunsettled. But if justice at least partly constitutes happiness and\njustice is unsettled, then Socrates is right to proceed as if\nhappiness is unsettled. \n\nIn sum, Socrates needs to construct an account of justice and an \naccount of happiness at the same time, and he needs these accounts to\nentail without assuming the conclusion that the just person is always\nhappier than the unjust. \n\nThe difficulty of this task helps to explain why Socrates takes the \ncurious route through the discussion of civic justice and civic \nhappiness. Socrates can assume that a just city is always more \nsuccessful or happy than an unjust city. The assumption begs no questions, \nand Glaucon and Adeimantus readily grant it. If Socrates can then \nexplain how a just city is always more successful and happy than an \nunjust city, by giving an account of civic justice and civic \nhappiness, he will have a model to propose for the relation between personal justice and flourishing. \n\nSocrates’ strategy depends on an analogy between a city and a person.\nThere must be some intelligible relation between what makes a city\nsuccessful and what makes a person successful.  But to answer the\nRepublic’s question, Socrates does not need any particular\naccount of why the analogy holds, nor does he need the\nanalogy to hold broadly (that is, for a wide range of\ncharacteristics). It works even if it only introduces an account of\npersonal justice and happiness that we might not have otherwise\nentertained. \n\nAlthough this is all that the city-person analogy needs to do,\nSocrates seems at times to claim more for it, and one of the abiding\npuzzles about the Republic concerns the exact nature and\ngrounds for the full analogy that Socrates claims. At times Socrates\nseems to say that the same account of justice must apply to both\npersons and cities because the same account of any predicate\n‘F’ must apply to all things that are F (e.g.,\n434d–435a). At other times Socrates seems to say that the same account\nof justice must apply in both cases because the F-ness of a whole is\ndue to the F-ness of its parts (e.g., 435d–436a). Again, at times\nSocrates seems to say that these grounds are strong enough to permit a\ndeductive inference: if a city’s F-ness is such-and-such, then a\nperson’s F-ness must be such-and-such (e.g., 441c). At other times,\nSocrates would prefer to use the F-ness of the city as a heuristic for\nlocating F-ness in persons (e.g., 368e–369a). Plato is surely right to\nthink that there is some interesting and non-accidental relation\nbetween the structural features and values of society and the\npsychological features and values of persons, but there is much\ncontroversy about whether this relation really is strong enough to\nsustain all of the claims that Socrates makes for it in\nthe Republic (Williams 1973, Lear 1992, Smith 1999, Ferrari\n2003). \n\nStill, the Republic primarily requires an answer to Glaucon \nand Adeimantus’ question, and that answer does not depend logically \non any strong claims for the analogy between cities and persons. \nRather, it depends upon a persuasive account of justice as a personal\nvirtue, and persuasive reasons why one is always happier being just \nthan unjust. So we can turn to these issues before returning to \nSocrates’ remarks about the successful city. \n\nSocrates seeks to define justice as one of the cardinal human \nvirtues, and he understands the virtues as states of the soul. So his\naccount of what justice is depends upon his account of the human \nsoul. \n\nAccording to the Republic, every human soul has three parts:\nreason, spirit, and appetite. (This is a claim about the embodied \nsoul. In Book Ten, Socrates argues that the soul is immortal \n(608c–611a) and says that the disembodied soul might be simple \n(611a–612a), though he declines to insist on this (612a) and the \nTimaeus and Phaedrus apparently disagree on the \nquestion.) At first blush, the tripartition can suggest a division \ninto beliefs, emotions, and desires. But Socrates explicitly ascribes\nbeliefs, emotions, and desires to each part of the soul (Moline 1978). In \nfact, it is not even clear that Plato would recognize psychological \nattitudes that are supposed to be representational without also being\naffective and conative, or conative and affective without also being \nrepresentational. Consequently, ‘belief’ and \n‘desire’ in translations or discussions of Plato \n(including this one) must be handled with care; they should not be \nunderstood along Humean lines as motivationally inert \nrepresentations, on the one hand, and non-cognitive motivators, on \nthe other. \n\nThe Republic offers two general reasons for the \ntripartition. First, Socrates argues that we cannot coherently \nexplain certain cases of psychological conflict unless we suppose \nthat there are at least two parts to the soul. The core of this \nargument is what we might call the principle of non-opposition: “the \nsame thing will not be willing to do or undergo opposites in the same\nrespect, in relation to the same thing, at the same time” (436b8–9). \nThis is a perfectly general metaphysical principle, comparable to \nAristotle’s principle of non-contradiction (Metaphysics G3 \n1005b19–20). Because of this principle, Socrates insists that one \nsoul cannot be the subject of opposing attitudes unless one \nof three conditions is met. One soul can be the subject of \nopposing attitudes if the attitudes oppose each other at different times, \neven in rapidly alternating succession (as Hobbes explains mental \nconflict). One soul can also be the subject of opposing attitudes if \nthe attitudes relate to different things, as a desire to drink \nchampagne and a desire to drink a martini might conflict. Last, one \nsoul can be the subject of opposing attitudes if the attitudes oppose\nin different respects. \n\nInitially, this third condition is obscure. The way Socrates\nhandles putative counter-examples to the principle of non-opposition\n(at 436c–e) might suggest that when one thing experiences one opposite\nin one of its parts and another in another, it is not\nexperiencing opposites in different respects (Stalley 1975; Bobonich 2002, 228–31; Lorenz 2006, 23–24). That would entail,\napparently, that it is not one thing experiencing opposites at all,\nbut merely a plurality. But Socrates later rewords the principle of\nnon-opposition’s “same respect” condition as a “same\npart” condition (439b), which explicitly allows one thing to\nexperience one opposite in one of its parts and another in\nanother. The most natural way of relating these two articulations of\nthe principle is to suppose that experiencing one opposite in one part\nand another in another is just one way to experience opposites in\ndifferent respects. But however we relate the two articulations to\neach other, Socrates clearly concludes that one soul can\nexperience simultaneously opposing attitudes in relation to the same\nthing, but only if different parts of it are the direct subjects of\nthe opposing attitudes. \n\nSocrates employs this general strategy four times. In Book Four, he\ntwice considers conflicting attitudes about what to do. First, he\nimagines a desire to drink being opposed by a calculated consideration\nthat it would be good not to drink (439a–d). (We might think,\nanachronistically, of someone about to undergo surgery.) This is\nsupposed to establish a distinction between appetite and reason.  Then\nhe considers cases like that of Leontius, who became angry with\nhimself for desiring to ogle corpses (439e–440b). These cases are\nsupposed to establish a distinction between appetite and spirit. In\nBook Ten, Socrates appeals to the principle of non-opposition when\nconsidering the decent man who has recently lost a son and is\nconflicted about grieving (603e–604b) (cf. Austin 2016) and when considering conflicting\nattitudes about how things appear to be (602c–603b) (cf. Moss 2008 and Singpurwalla 2011). These show a\nbroad division between reason and an inferior part of the soul (Ganson 2009); it is\ncompatible with a further distinction between two inferior parts,\nspirit and appetite. \n\nSocrates’ arguments from psychological conflict are well-tailored to \nexplain akrasia (weakness of will) (Penner 1990, Bobonich 1994, Carone 2001). In the Protagoras, \nSocrates denies that anyone willingly does other than what she \nbelieves to be best, but in the Republic, the door is opened\nfor a person to act on an appetitive attitude that conflicts with a \nrational attitude for what is best. How far the door is open to \nakrasia awaits further discussion below. For now, there are other \nmore pressing questions about the Republic’s explanation of \npsychological conflict. \n\nFirst, what kinds of parts are reason, spirit, and appetite? Some\nscholars believe that they are merely conceptual parts, akin to\nsubsets of a set (Shields 2001, Price 2009). They would object to characterizing the parts\nas subjects of psychological attitudes. But the arguments\nfrom conflict treat reason, spirit, and appetite as distinct subjects\nof psychological states and events, and it seems best to take\nSocrates’ descriptions at face value unless there is compelling reason\nnot to (Kamtekar 2006). At face value, Socrates offers a more robust conception of\nparts, wherein each part is like an independent agent.  \n\nIndeed, this notion of parts is robust enough to make one wonder why \nreason, spirit, and appetite are parts at all, as opposed to\nthree independent subjects. But the Republic proceeds as \nthough every embodied human being has just one soul that comprises \nthree parts. No embodied soul is perfectly unified: even the virtuous\nperson, who makes her soul into a unity as much as she can (443c–e), \nhas three parts in her soul. (She must, as we shall see, in order to \nbe just.) But every embodied soul enjoys an unearned unity: every \nhuman’s reason, spirit, and appetite constitute a single soul that is\nthe unified source of that human’s life and is a unified locus of \nresponsibility for that human’s thoughts and actions. (It is not as though a person is held responsible for \nwhat his reason does but not for what his appetite does.) There are \nquestions about what exactly explains this unearned unity of the \nsoul (see E. Brown 2012). \n\nThere are also questions about whether the arguments from conflict \nestablish exactly three parts of the soul (and see Whiting 2012). Some worry that the \ndiscussion of Leontius does not warrant the recognition of a third \npart of the soul (but see Brennan 2012), and some worry that the appetitive part contains \nsuch a multitude of attitudes that it must be subject to further \nconflicts and further partitioning (and see 443e with Kamtekar 2008). Answering these \nquestions requires us to characterize more precisely the kind of\nopposition that forces partitioning , in accordance with the principle\nof non-opposition (compare Reeve 1988, 124–31; Irwin 1995, 203–17; Price 1995, 46–48; and Lorenz 2006, 13–52), and to examine more carefully the broader features\nbeing attributed to the three parts of the soul (on appetite, e.g., compare Bobonich 2002, Lorenz 2006, and Moss 2008). \n\nFortunately, the arguments from conflict do not work alone. Indeed, \nthey cannot, as the principle of non-opposition merely establishes a \nconstraint on successful psychological explanations. Appeals to this \nprinciple can show where some division must exist, but they do not by\nthemselves characterize the parts so divided. So, already in Book \nFour’s arguments from conflict, Socrates invokes broader patterns of \npsychology and appeals to the parts to explain these patterns (cf. \n435d–436b). \n\nThis appeal to reason, spirit, and appetite to explain broader \npatterns of human thought and action constitutes the \nRepublic’s second general strategy to support tripartition. \nIt receives its fullest development in Books Eight and Nine, where \nSocrates uses his theory of the tripartite soul to explain a variety \nof psychological constitutions. In the most basic implementation of \nthis strategy, Socrates distinguishes people ruled by reason, those \nruled by spirit, and those ruled by appetite (580d–581e, esp. 581c): \nthe first love wisdom and truth, the second love victory and honor, \nand the third profit and money. This simplistic division, it might be\nnoted in passing, fixes the sides for an ongoing debate about \nwhether it is best to be a philosopher, a politician, or an epicure \n(see, e.g., Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics I 5 and X 6–8). \nBut more important for our purposes here, this basic classification \ngreatly illuminates the division of the soul. \n\nFirst, we learn about the organizing aims of each of the psychological\nparts (Cooper 1984, Kahn 1987, Reeve 1988, Moss 2005). In Book Four, reason is characterized by its ability to track\nwhat is good for each part and the soul as a whole (441e, 442c). In\nBook Nine, reason is characterized by its desire for wisdom. These are\nnot bifurcated aims. Socrates argues that people are not satisfied merely\nwith what they take to be good for themselves but want\nwhat is in fact good for them (505d). So reason naturally\npursues not just what it takes to be good for the whole soul but also\nthe wisdom that ensures that it would get this right. Nor is wisdom’s\nvalue merely instrumental to discovering what is good for one. If\nwisdom is a fundamental constituent of virtue and virtue is a\nfundamental constituent of what is good for a human being, then wisdom\nturns out to be a fundamental constituent of what is good for a human\nbeing. So it should not be surprising that the part of the soul that\ntracks and pursues what is good for the whole soul also loves\nwisdom. Spirit, by contrast, tracks social preeminence and honor. If\n‘good’ is the organizing predicate for rational attitudes,\n‘honorable’ or ‘fine’ (Greek kalon)\nis the organizing predicate for spirited attitudes (Singpurwalla 2013). Finally, appetite\nseeks material satisfaction for bodily urges, and because money better\nthan anything else provides this, people ruled by appetite often come\nto love money above all. \n\nThe basic division of the world into philosophers, honor-lovers, and\nmoney-lovers also illuminates what Socrates means by talking of being\nruled by one part of the soul. If one part dominates in you, then aims\nof that part are your aims. If, for example, you are ruled by spirit,\nthen your reason conceives of your good in terms of what is\nhonorable. Reason has its own aim, to get what is in fact good for the\nwhole soul, but in a soul perfectly ruled by spirit, where there are\nno genuine psychological conflicts between different parts, reason’s\nlove for truth and wisdom must be limited to that which is also held\nto be honorable. \n\nStill, Plato’s full psychological theory is much more complicated than\nthe basic division of persons would suggest. First, there are\ndifferent kinds of appetitive attitudes (558d–559c, 571a–572b): some\nare necessary for human beings; some are unnecessary but regulable\n(“lawful”), and some are unnecessary and entirely\nuncontrollable (“lawless”). So there are in fact five\nkinds of pure psychological constitutions: aristocratically\nconstituted persons (those ruled by their rational attitudes),\ntimocratically constituted persons (those ruled by their spirited\nattitudes), oligarchically constituted persons (ruled by necessary\nappetitive attitudes), democratically constituted persons (ruled by\nunnecessary appetitive attitudes), and tyrannically constituted\npersons (ruled by lawless appetitive attitudes). The first three of these constitutions are characteristically ordered toward simple aims (wisdom, honor, and money, respectively), but the last two are not so ordered, because there is no simple aim of the unnecessary appetites, be they lawful or lawless. In effect, the democratic and tyrannical souls treat desire-satisfaction itself and the pleasure associated with it as their end. The democrat treats all desires and pleasures as equally valuable and restricts herself to lawful desires, but the tyrant embraces disordered, lawless desires and has a special passion for the apparently most intense, bodily pleasures (cf. Scott 2000, Johnstone 2013, and Johnstone 2015). \n\nThe second complication is that some people are not perfectly ruled by\none part of the soul, but are subject to continuing conflicts between,\nsay, attitudes in favor of doing what is honorable and appetitive\nattitudes in favor of pursuing a shameful tryst. Socrates does not\nconcentrate on these people, nor does he say how common they are. But\nhe does acknowledge their existence (544c–d, cf. 445c).  Moreover, the\noccurrence of akrasia would seem to require their existence. For if I\nam perfectly ruled by my spirit, then I take my good to be what is\nhonorable, and how could I be akratic?  My spirit and my reason are in\nline, so there will be no overpowering of rational preferences about\nwhat is best by spirit. You might suppose that my appetite could\novercome my sense of what is honorable, but in that case, it would\nseem that I am not, after all, perfectly ruled by my spirit. Things\nmight seem different with people ruled by their appetite. Certainly,\nif I were perfectly ruled by appetite, then I would be susceptible to\nakrasia of the impetuous sort, acting on appetitive desires without\nreflectively endorsing them as good. But impetuous akrasia is quite\ndistinct from the standard akrasia in which I endorse φing as best\nfor me and at just that moment intentionally ψ instead, and\nstandard akrasia would seem to be impossible in any soul that is\nperfectly ruled by any one part of the soul. If you think that\ncompeting appetitive attitudes could give rise to a strict case of\nstandard akrasia, you should recall how Socrates would have to explain\nthese cases of psychological conflict in order to avoid multiplying\nhis divisions in the soul. \n\nThe general strategy of the Republic’s psychology—to\nexplain human thought and action by reference to subpersonal\nhomunculi—remains both appealing and problematic (Burnyeat 2006). Moreover, the\ndialogue is filled with pointed observations and fascinating\nspeculations about human psychology. Some of them pull us up short,\nas, for example, the Freudian recognition of Oedipal desires that come\nout only in dreams (571c–d). The full theory is complex, and there\nremain numerous questions about many of its details.  \n\nFortunately, these questions do not have to be settled here for us to\nentertain Socrates’ response to Glaucon and Adeimantus’ challenge. \nIndeed, although his response builds closely on the psychological \ntheory, some broad features of the response could be accepted even by\nthose who reject the tripartite psychology. \n\nIn Book Four, Socrates defines each of the cardinal virtues in terms \nof the complicated psychology he has just sketched. A person is wise \njust in case her rational attitudes are functioning well, so that her\nrational part “has in it the knowledge of what is advantageous for \neach part [of the soul] and for the whole in common of the three \nparts” (442c5–8). So the unwise person has a faulty conception of \nwhat is good for him. A person is courageous just in case her \nspirited attitudes do not change in the face of pains and pleasures \nbut stay in agreement with what is rationally recognized as fearsome \nand not (442bc). So the coward will, in the face of prospective \npains, fail to bear up to what he rationally believes is not \ngenuinely fearsome, and the rash person will, in the face of \nprospective pleasures, rush headlong into what he rationally believes\nto be fearsome. A person is temperate or moderate just in case the \ndifferent parts of her soul are in agreement. So the intemperate \nperson has appetitive or spirited attitudes in competition with the \nrational attitudes, appetitive or spirited attitudes other than those\nthe rational attitudes deem to be good. Finally, a person is just \njust in case all three parts of her soul are functioning as they \nshould (441d12–e2; cf. 443c9–e2). Justice, then, requires the other \nvirtues. So the \nunjust person fails to be moderate, or fails to be wise, or fails to \nbe courageous. \n\nActually, the relation among the virtues seems tighter than that, for\nit seems that the unjust person necessarily fails to be wise, \ncourageous, and temperate (cf. Cooper 1998). You might try to deny this. You \nmight say that a person could be courageous—with spirited \nattitudes that track perfectly what the rational attitudes say is \nfearsome and not, in the face of any pleasures and pains—but \nstill be unjust insofar has her rational attitudes are inadequately \ndeveloped, failing to know what really is fearsome. But Socrates \nseems to balk at this possibility by contrasting the civically \ncourageous whose spirit preserves law-inculcated beliefs about what \nis fearsome and not and the genuinely courageous in whom, presumably,\nspirit preserves knowledge about what is fearsome and not (430a–c). \nSo you might say instead that a person could be \nmoderate—utterly without appetitive attitudes at odds with what\nhis rational attitudes say is good for him—but still be unjust \ninsofar as his rational attitudes are inadequately developed and fail\nto know what really is good. But this picture of a meek, but moderate\nsoul seems to sell short the requirements of moderation, which are \nnot merely that there be no insurrections in the soul but also that \nthere be agreement that the rational attitudes should rule. This \nwould seem to require that there actually be appetitive attitudes \nthat are in agreement with the rational attitudes’ conception of what\nis good, which would in turn require that the rational attitudes be \nsufficiently strong to have a developed conception of what is good. \nMoreover, it would seem to require that the rational attitudes which \nendorse ruling be ruling, which would in turn require that the \nrational attitudes are at least on the path toward determining what \nreally is good for the person. If these considerations are correct, \nthen the unjust are lacking in virtue tout court, whereas \nthe just possess all of the virtues. \n\nAfter sketching these four virtues in Book Four, Socrates is ready to\nmove from considering what justice is in a person to why a person \nshould be just (444e). But this is premature. Socrates is moving to \nshow that it is always better to have a just soul, but he was asked \nto show that it is always better to be the person who does just \nactions. We might doubt that an answer concerning psychological \njustice is relevant to the question concerning practical justice (Sachs 1963). \n\nIt is easy to misstate this objection (Demos 1964, Dahl 1991). The problem is not that the \nquestion is about justice as it is ordinarily understood and Socrates\nis failing to address conventional justice. Neither the question nor \nthe answer is bound to how justice is ordinarily understood, given \nwhat happened in Book One. Moreover, the problem is not that \nSocrates’ answer is relevant only if the class of the psychologically\njust and the class of the practically just are coextensive. That \nwould require Socrates to show that everyone who acts justly has a \njust soul, and Socrates quite reasonably shows no inclination for \nthat thesis. (Some people do what is right for the wrong reasons.) He may have to establish some connection \nbetween doing just actions and becoming psychologically just if he is\nto give reasons to those who are not yet psychologically just to do \njust actions, but an account of habituation would be enough to do \nthis (cf. 443e, 444c–d). \n\nThe real problem raised by the objection is this: how can Socrates \njustify the claim that people with just souls are practically just? \nFirst, he must be able to show that the psychologically just refrain \nfrom injustice, and second, he must be able to show that the \npsychologically just do what is required by justice. The first point \nreceives a gesture when Socrates is trying to secure the claim that \nharmonious functioning of the whole soul really deserves to be called\njustice (442e–443a), but he offers no real argument. Perhaps the best\nwe can do on his behalf is to insist that the first point is not a \nthesis for argument but a bold empirical hypothesis. On this view, it\nis simply an empirical question whether all those who have the \nmotivations to do unjust things happen to have souls that are out of \nbalance, and an army of psychologists would be needed to answer the \nquestion. \n\nThat might seem bad enough, but the second point does not even receive\na gesture. There is no denying the presence of this second requirement\non the grounds that justice is a matter of refraining from harm\n(“negative duties”) and not of helping others\n(“positive duties”). Socrates does not criticize the Book\nOne suggestion that justice requires helping friends (332a ff.); he\nand his interlocutors agree that justice requires respect for parents\nand care for the gods (443a); and they treat the principle that each\nshould do his job (and thereby contribute to the city) as the image of\njustice (443c). So according to Plato’s Republic justice\nincludes both negative and positive duties. \n\nBefore we can consider Socrates’ answer to the question of the \nRepublic, we must have reason to accept that those who have \nharmonious souls do what is required by justice. Otherwise, we cannot\nbe sure that psychological harmony is justice. Unfortunately, \nSocrates does not give any explicit attention to this worry at the \nend of Book Four or in the argument of Books Eight and Nine. But \nthere are other places to look for a solution to this worry. First, \nwe might look to Books Five through Seven. Second, we might look to \nBooks Two and Three. \n\nIn Book Four Socrates says that the just person is wise and thus knows\nwhat is good for him, but he does not say anything about what\nknowledge or the good is. In Books Five through Seven he clearly\naddresses these issues and fills out his account of virtue. He shows,\nin sum, that one is virtuous if and only if one is a philosopher, for\nhe adds to Book Four’s insistence that virtue requires knowledge the\nnew claim that only philosophers have knowledge (esp. 474b–480a). His\naccount also opens the possibility that knowledge of the good provides\nthe crucial link between psychological justice and just actions. \n\nThe philosophers are initially distinguished from non-philosophers \nbecause they answer questions like ‘What is beautiful?’ \nby identifying the imperceptible property (form) of beauty instead of \nsome perceptible property or particulars (474b–480a). Socrates does not \nname any philosophers who can knowledgeably answer questions like \nthat. In fact, his account of how philosophers would be educated in \nthe ideal city suggests that the ability to give knowledgeable \nanswers requires an enormous amount of (largely mathematical) \nlearning in advance of the questions themselves (521b–540a). How \nwould this mathematical learning and knowledge of forms affect one’s \nmotivations? \n\nOne effect can be found by interpreting the form of the good that the\nphilosopher comes to grasp, since this should shape the philosopher’s\nrational conception of what is good for her. The form of the good is \na shadowy presence in the Republic, lurking behind the images\nof the Sun, Line, and Cave. But it is clear enough that Socrates \ntakes goodness to be unity (Hitchcock 1985). He explicitly emphasizes that a virtuous \nperson makes himself a unity (443c–e) and insists that a city is made\ngood by being made a unity (462a–b). The assumption that goodness is \nunity also explains why mathematics is so important to the ascent to \nthe good (through mathematics an account of the one over the many is \nlearned) (cf. Burnyeat 2000), why the good is superior to other forms (the good is the \nunity or coherence of them, and not another alongside them), why the \nother forms are good (by being part of the unified or coherent \norder), and why goodness secures the intelligibility of the other \nforms (they are fully known teleologically). (It also comports with \nthe evidence concerning Plato’s lecture on the good (e.g., \nAristoxenus, Elementa Harmonica II 1; cf. Aristotle \nEudemian Ethics 1218a20 and Metaphysics 988a8–16 \nand b10–15.) So the philosophers, by grasping the form of the good, \nwill recognize goodness in themselves as the unity in their souls. \nThey will see that the harmony or coherence of their psychological \nattitudes makes them good, that each of their attitudes is good \ninsofar as it is part of a coherent set, and that their actions are \ngood insofar as they sustain the unity in their souls (cf. 443e). \n\nBut there are other ways in which mathematical learning and knowledge\nof forms might affect one’s motivations. Socrates suggests one way \nwhen he says that a philosopher will aspire to imitate the harmony \namong the forms (500b–d). Some scholars have understood Socrates to \nbe saying that philosophers will desire to reproduce this order by \ncultivating more order and virtue in the world, as Diotima suggests \nin the Symposium (Irwin 1995, 298–317; cf. Waterlow 1972–1973, Cooper 1977, Kraut 1991). On this reading, knowledge of the forms \nmotivates just actions that help other people, which helps to solve \nthe standing worry about the relation between psychological justice \nand practical justice. \n\nUnfortunately, it is far from obvious that this is what Socrates\nmeans. He does not actually say in the Republic that\nknowledge of the forms freely motivates beneficence. In fact, he says\neight times that the philosophers in the ideal city will have to be\ncompelled to rule and do their part in sustaining the perfectly just\ncity (473d4, 500d4, 519e4, 520a8, 520e2, 521b7, 539e3, 540b5). It is\npossible to understand this compulsion as the constraint of justice:\nthe philosophers rule because justice demands that they rule. But\nSocrates himself suggests a different way of characterizing the\ncompulsion. He suggests that the compulsion comes from a law that requires those\nwho are educated to be philosophers to rule. Moreover, this\ncharacterization better fits Socrates’ insistence that the\nphilosophers are the best rulers because they prefer not to rule even\nwhile they are ruling (520e–521b, with 519c and 540b). For on this\naccount, the philosophers’ justice alone does not motivate them to\nrule; rather, their justice motivates them to obey the law, which\njustly compels them to rule (E. Brown 2000). \n\nThere is another reason to worry about explaining just actions by the\nmotivating power of knowledge. If the philosophers are motivated to \ndo what is just by their knowledge of the forms, then there would \nseem to be an enormous gap between philosophers and non-philosophers.\nIn addition to the epistemic gap—the philosophers have \nknowledge and the non-philosophers do not—we have a \nmotivational gap: the philosophers’ knowledge gives them motivations \nto do what is required by justice, and the non-philosophers are not \nsimilarly motivated. This gap suggests some rather unpalatable \nconclusions about the character of non-philosophers’ lives even in \nthe ideal city, and it also sits poorly with Socrates’ evident desire\nto take the philosophers’ justice as a paradigm that can be usefully \napproximated by non-philosophers (472c–d). \n\nSocrates’ long discussion in Books Two and Three of how to educate \nthe guardians for the ideal city offers a different approach (E. Brown 2004, Singpurwalla 2006; cf. Gill 1985, Kamtekar 1998, and Scott 1999). This \neducation is most often noted for its carefully censored “reading \nlist;” the young guardians-to-be will not be exposed to inappropriate\nimages of gods and human beings. Less often noted is how optimistic \nSocrates is about the results of a sufficiently careful education. \nA well-trained guardian will “praise fine things, be pleased by them, \nreceive them into his soul, and, being nurtured by them, become fine \nand good,” and each will “rightly object to what is shameful, hating \nit while he’s still young and unable to grasp the reason” \n(401e4–402a2; cf. 441e). Note that Socrates has the young guardians \nnot only responding to good things as honorable (with spirited \nattitudes), but also becoming fine and good. Moreover, \nSocrates is confident that the spirited guardians are stably good: \nwhen he is describing the possibility of civic courage in Book Four, \nhe suggests that proper education can stain the spirited part of the \nsoul with the right dispositions so deeply that they will be \npreserved “through everything” (429b8, 429c8, 430b2–3). \n\nThis optimism suggests that the motivations to do what is right are \nacquired early in moral education, built into a soul that might \nbecome, eventually, perfectly just. And this in turn suggests one \nreason why Socrates might have skipped the question of why the \npsychologically just can be relied upon to do what is right. Socrates\nmight assume that anyone who is psychologically just must have \nbeen raised well, and that anyone who has been raised well will do \nwhat is right. So understood, early childhood education, and not \nknowledge of the forms, links psychological\njustice and just action. \n\nOf course, there are questions about how far Socrates could extend\nthis optimism about imperfect virtue among non-philosophers. Perhaps\nhonor-loving members of the auxiliary class have psychological harmony\nsecured by their consistent attachment to what they have learned is\nhonorable, but what about the members of the producing class? Can\ntheir attachment to the satisfaction of bodily desires be educated in\nsuch a way that they enjoy, in optimal social circumstances, a\nwell-ordered soul? Do they even receive a primary education in the\nideal city? These questions will be considered more fully below (and see Wilberding 2012 and Wilburn 2014). \n\nOpen questions aside, it should be clear that there are two general \nways of linking psychological justice to just action: one that \ndepends upon the motivational power of knowledge in particular and \nthe other that depends upon the early training of a wide range of \nattitudes in the young. If one of these ways works, then Socrates is \nentitled to argue that it is always better to be just than unjust by \nshowing why it is always better to have a harmonious soul. \n\nIt is possible to find in the Republic as many as five\nseparate arguments for the claim that it is better to be just than\nunjust, without regard to how other people and gods perceive us. The\nfirst appeals to an analogy between psychological health and physical\nhealth in Book Four (445a–b). The second, third, and fourth are what\nSocrates calls his three “proofs” in Books Eight and Nine\n(543c–580c, esp. 576b–580c; 580c–583a; 583b–588a). And the fifth is\nthe image of the human soul consisting of a little human being\n(reason), a lion (spirit), and a many-headed beast (appetite) (588b\nff.). Yet the first of these is interrupted and said in Book Eight to\nbe continuous with the first “proof” of Books Eight and\nNine (543c), and the last of them seems to be offered as a closing\nexhortation. This whittling leaves us with the three arguments that\nSocrates labels his “proofs” (580c9, cf. 583b), the first\ndiscussing psychological health and disease at length and the second\nand third concerning pleasure. \n\nAlready in Book Four, Glaucon is ready to declare that unjust souls \nare ruined and in turmoil. But Socrates presses for a fuller \nreckoning. When he finally resumes in Book Eight where he had left \noff in Book Four, Socrates offers a long account of four defective \npsychological types. The list is not exhaustive (544cd, cf. \n445c), but it captures the four imperfect kinds of pure psychological\nconstitutions: pure rule by spirited attitudes, pure rule by \nnecessary appetitive attitudes, pure rule by unnecessary but \nregulable appetitive attitudes, and pure rule by lawless appetitive \nattitudes. At the end of this long discussion, Socrates will again \nask which sort of person lives the best life: the aristocratic soul \nof Books Six and Seven, or one of the other souls of Books Eight and \nNine? \n\nWe might expect Socrates and Glaucon to argue carefully by \nelimination, showing the just life to be better than every sort of \nunjust life. But they do not. Instead, they quickly contrast the \ntyrannical soul with the aristocratic soul, the most unjust with the \nmost just. This might seem to pick up on Glaucon’s original demand \n(in Book Two) to see how the perfectly just—who is most \nunfortunate but still just—is better than the perfectly \nunjust—who is unjust but still esteemed. But it does not even \ndo that, since Socrates is very far from portraying the best soul in \nthe least favorable circumstances and the worst soul in the most \nfavorable circumstances. Nevertheless, Socrates’ limited comparison \nin Book Nine might provide the resources to explain why it is better \nto be the unluckiest philosopher than the luckiest tyrant and why it \nis better to be just than to be unjust in any way whatsoever, for it \nmight provide general lessons that apply to these other comparisons. \n\nSocrates and Glaucon characterize the person ruled by his lawless \nattitudes as enslaved, as least able to do what it wants, as full of \ndisorder and regret, as poor and unsatisfiable, and as fearful \n(577c–578a). These characterizations fit in a logical order. The \ntyrant is enslaved because he is ruled by an utterly unlimited \nappetite, which prompts in him appetitive desire whenever any chance \nobject of appetite presents itself to his consideration. Given this \ncondition, he experiences appetitive desires that he cannot satisfy, \neither because they are too difficult for him to satisfy or because \nsatisfying them would prevent satisfying other of his desires. His \nexperience of unsatisfied desires must make him wish that he could \nsatisfy them and feel poor and unsatisfiable because he cannot. \nWorse, because his unsatisfied appetitive desires continue to press \nfor satisfaction over time, they make him aware of his past inability\nto to do what he wants, which prompts regret, and of his likely \nfuture inability to do what he wants, which makes him fearful. The \nresult is a miserable existence, and the misery is rooted in \nunlimited attitudes that demand more satisfaction than a person can \nachieve. In a nutshell, the tyrant lacks the capacity to do what he \nwants to do. \n\nThe philosopher, by contrast, is most able to do what she wants to \ndo, for she wants to do what is best, and as long as one has agency, \nthere would seem to be a doable best. (Should circumstances make a \ncertain apparent best undoable, then it would no longer appear to be \nbest.) But this is not to say that the philosopher is guaranteed to \nbe able to do what she wants. First, Socrates is quite clear that \nsome appetitive attitudes are necessary, and one can well imagine \ncircumstances of extreme deprivation in which the necessary \nappetitive attitudes (for food or drink, say) are unsatisfiable. \nSecond, the capacity to do what is best might require engaging in \ncertain kinds of activities in order to maintain itself. So even if \nthe philosopher can satisfy her necessary appetitive attitudes, she \nmight be prevented by unfortunate circumstances from the sorts of \nregular thought and action that are required to hold onto the \ncapacity to do what is best. Thus, even if a philosophical soul is \nmost able to do what it wants, and the closest thing to a sure bet \nfor this capacity, it does not retain this ability in every \ncircumstance. \n\nThis comparison between the tyrannical soul and the philosophical \nsoul does all the work that Socrates needs if the capacity to do what\none wants correlates closely with human success or happiness and if \nthe lessons about the tyrant’s incapacity generalize to the other \ndefective psychological constitutions.  \n\nSocrates does not need happiness to be the capacity to do \nwhat one wants, or the absence of regret, frustration, and fear. He \ncould continue to think, as he thought in Book One, that happiness is\nvirtuous activity (354a). But if his argument here works, happiness, \nwhatever it is, must require the capacity to do what one wants and be\ninconsistent with regret, frustration, and fear. \n\nHow does the argument apply to unjust people who are not \npsychologically tyrannical? Anyone who is not a philosopher either \nhas a divided soul or is ruled by spirit or appetite. Division in the soul \nplainly undercuts the ability to do what one wants. Can one seek \nhonor or money above all and do what one wants? Although the ability \nto do what is honorable or make money is not as flexible as the \nability to do what is best, it is surely possible, in favorable \ncircumstances, for someone to be consistently able to do what is \nhonorable or money-making. This will not work if the agent is \nconflicted about what is honorable or makes money. So he needs to be \ncarefully educated, and he needs limited options. But if he does \nenjoy adequate education and an orderly social environment, there is \nno reason to suppose that he could not escape being racked by regret,\nfrustration, or fear. This explains how the members of the lower \nclasses in Socrates’ ideal city—who are probably not best identified as the timocrats and oligarchs of Book Eight (Wilberding 2009 and Jeon 2014)—can have a kind of capacity to do \nwhat they want, even though they are slavishly dependent upon the \nrulers’ work (cf. 590c–d). \n\nThe characterization of appropriately ruled non-philosophers as \nslavish might suggest a special concern for the “heteronomous” \ncharacter of their capacity to do what they want and a special \nvalorization of the philosophers’ “autonomous” capacity. But we \nshould be hesitant about applying these frequently confused and \npossibly anachronistic concepts to the Republic. Plato would\nprobably prefer to think in terms of self-sufficiency (369b), and for the \npurposes of Socrates’ argument here, it is enough to contrast the way\na producer’s capacity is deeply dependent upon social surroundings \nand the way a philosopher’s capacity is relatively free from this \ndependence, once it has been cultivated. \n\nThis contrast must not be undersold, for it is plausible to think \nthat the self-sufficiency of the philosopher makes him better off. \nAppropriately ruled non-philosophers can enjoy the capacity to do \nwhat they want only so long as their circumstances are appropriately \nruled, and this makes their success far less stable than what the \nphilosophers enjoy. Things in the world tend to change, and the \nphilosopher is in a much better position to flourish through these \nchanges. Those of us living in imperfect cities, looking to the \nRepublic for a model of how to live (cf. 592b), need to \nemulate the philosopher in order to pursue stable, reliable success or \nhappiness. \n\nNevertheless, so far as this argument shows, the success or happiness of \nappropriately ruled non-philosophers is just as real as that\nof philosophers. Judged exclusively by the capacity to do what one wants \nand the presence or absence of regret, frustration, and fear, \nphilosophers are not better off than very fortunate non-philosophers. \n(The non-philosophers have to be so fortunate that they do not even \nrecognize any risk to their good fortune. Otherwise, they would fear \na change in their luck.) The philosopher’s success is more secure \nthan the non-philosopher’s, but if it is also better as success than the \nnon-philosopher’s, Socrates’ first argument does not show that it is. (See also Kenny 1969 and Kraut 1992.) \n\nSocrates needs further argument in any case if he wants to convince \nthose of us in imperfect circumstances (like Glaucon and Adeimantus) \nto pursue the philosophical life of perfect justice. The first \nargument tries to show that anyone who wants to satisfy her desires \nperfectly should cultivate certain kinds of desires rather than \nothers. We can reject this argument in either of two ways, by taking \nissue with his analysis of which desires are regularly satisfiable \nand which are not, or by explaining why a person should not want to \nsatisfy her desires perfectly. The first response calls for a \nquasi-empirical investigation of a difficult sort, but the second \nseems easy. We can just argue that a good human life must be subject \nto regret and loss. Of course, it is not enough to say that the human\ncondition is in fact marked by regret and loss. There is no \ninconsistency in maintaining that one should aim at a secure life in \norder to live the best possible human life while also realizing that \nthe best possible human life will be marked by insecurity. In fact, \none might even think that the proper experience of fragility requires\nattachment to security as one’s end. Instead, to reject Socrates’ argument,\nwe must show that it is wrong to aim at a life that is free of regret\nand loss: we must show that the pursuit of security leads one to \nreject certain desires that one should not reject. In this way, we \nmove beyond a discussion of which desires are satisfiable, and we \ntackle the question about the value of what is desired and the value \nof the desiring itself. To address this possible objection, Socrates \nneeds to give us a different argument. \n\nThis explains why Socrates does not stop after offering his first\n“proof.” Many readers are puzzled about why he offers two\nmore. After all, the geometer does not need to offer multiple proofs\nof his theorem. What might seem worse, the additional proofs concern\npleasure, and thereby introduce—seemingly at the eleventh\nhour—a heap of new considerations for the ethics of the\nRepublic. But as the considerations at the end of the \nprevious section show, these pleasure proofs are crucial. \n\nPlato merely dramatizes these considerations. Socrates has offered not\nmerely to demonstrate that it is always better to be just than unjust\nbut to persuade Glaucon and Adeimantus (but especially Glaucon: see,\ne.g., 327a, 357a–b, 368c) of this claim. Insofar as Glaucon shows\nsympathy for spirited attitudes (372d with the discussion\nin\n section 4.1\n below, and cf. 548d), his attachment\nto these attitudes could survive the realization that they are far\nfrom perfectly satisfiable. He may say, “I can see the point of\nperfectly satisfiable attitudes, but those attitudes (and their objects)\nare not as good as my less-than-perfectly\nsatisfiable attitudes (and their objects).” Glaucon needs to be shown that the\nrewards of carrying insecure attitudes do not make up for the\ninsecurity. \n\nThe additional proofs serve a second purpose, as well. At the end of \nBook Five, Socrates says that faculties (at least psychological \nfaculties) are distinguished by their results (their rate of success)\nand by their objects (what they concern) (477c–d). So far, he has \ndiscussed only the success-rates of various kinds of psychological \nattitudes. He needs to discuss the objects of various kinds of \npsychological attitudes in order to complete his account. If we did \nnot have the discussion of the second proof, in particular, we would \nhave an incomplete picture of the Republic’s moral psychology. \n\nThe two arguments that Socrates proceeds to make are frustratingly \ndifficult (see Gosling and Taylor 1982, Nussbaum 1986, Russell 2005, Moss 2006, Warren 2014, Shaw 2016). They are very quick, and though they concern “pleasures,” \nSocrates never says exactly what pleasure is. (At one point \n(585d11), the now-standard translation of the Republic by \nGrube and Reeve suggests that “being filled with what is appropriate \nto our nature is pleasure,” but it is better to read less into the \nGreek by rendering the clause “being filled with what is appropriate \nto our nature is pleasant.”) The first argument suggests that \npleasures might be activities of a certain kind, but the remarkably \nabstract second argument does not provide any special support to that\nsuggestion. Even if a convincing account of how Plato wants us to \nconceive of pleasure in the Republic is wanting, however, we\ncan get a grasp on the form of the two “pleasure proofs.” \n\nThe first is an appeal to\nauthority, in four easy steps. First, Socrates suggests that just as\neach part of the soul has its own characteristic desires and\npleasures, so persons have characteristic desires and pleasures\ndepending upon which part of their soul rules them. The characteristic\npleasure of philosophers is learning. The characteristic pleasure of\nhonor-lovers is being honored. The characteristic pleasure of\nmoney-lovers is making money.  Next, Socrates suggests that each of\nthese three different kinds of person would say that her own\npleasure is best. So, third, to decide which pleasure really is best,\nwe need to determine which sort of person’s judgment is best, and\nSocrates suggests that whoever has the most reason, experience, and\nargument is the best judge. Finally, Socrates argues that the\nphilosopher is better than the honor-lover and the money-lover in\nreason, experience, and argument. \n\nIt is sometimes thought that the philosopher cannot be better off in \nexperience, for the philosopher has never lived as an adult who is \nfully committed to the pleasures of the money-lover. But this point \ndoes not disable Socrates’ argument. The philosopher does not have \nexactly the experience that the money-lover has, but the \nphilosopher has far more experience of the money-lover’s \npleasures than the money-lover has of the philosopher’s pleasures. \nThe comparative judgment is enough to secure Socrates’ conclusion: \nbecause the philosopher is a better judge than the others, \nthe philosopher’s judgment has a better claim on the truth. \n\nBut this first proof does not explain why the distinction in \npleasures is made; the appeal to the philosopher’s authority as a \njudge gives no account of the philosopher’s reasons for her judgment.\nMoreover, the first pleasure proof does not say that the \nphilosopher’s pleasures are vastly superior to those of the \nmoney-lover and the honor-lover. So Glaucon—or anyone else \ntempted to avoid the mathematical studies of Book Seven—might \nthink that the superiority of the philosopher’s psychological justice\nis slight, and given the disrepute heaped on the philosophers (487a \nff.), Glaucon or anyone else might decide that the \nless-than-perfectly just life is better overall. Socrates needs to \nshow that the philosopher’s activities are vastly better than the \nnon-philosopher’s activities in order to answer the challenge \noriginally put forth in Book Two by Glaucon and Adeimantus. So it is \nfor very good reason that Socrates proceeds to offer a second \npleasure proof that he promises to be the “greatest and most decisive\noverthrow” for the unjust (583b6–7). \n\nSocrates’ final argument moves in three broad steps. The first \nestablishes that pleasure and pain are not exhaustive contradictories\nbut opposites, separated by a calm middle that is neither pain nor \npleasure. This may sometimes seem false. The removal of pain can seem\nto be pleasant, and the removal of a pleasure can seem to be painful.\nBut Socrates argues that these appearances are deceptive. He \ndistinguishes between pleasures that fill a lack and thereby replace \na pain (these are not genuine pleasures) and those that do not fill a\nlack and thereby replace a pain (these are genuine pleasures). The \nsecond step in the argument is to establish that most bodily \npleasures—and the most intense of these—fill a painful \nlack and are not genuine pleasures. Finally, Socrates argues that the\nphilosopher’s pleasures do not fill a painful lack and are genuine \npleasures. Contra the epicure’s assumption, the philosopher’s \npleasures are more substantial than pleasures of the flesh. \n\nThe pleasure proofs tempt some readers to suppose that Socrates must \nhave a hedonistic conception of happiness. After all, he claims to \nhave shown that the just person is happier than the unjust (580a–c), \nand he says that his pleasure arguments are proofs of the same \nclaim (580c–d, 583b). But these arguments can work just as the first \nproof works: Socrates can suppose that happiness, whatever it is, \nis marked by pleasure (just as it is marked by the absence of regret,\nfrustration, and fear). This is not to say that one should take \npleasure to be one’s goal any more than it is to say that one should \npursue fearlessness as one’s goal. Pleasure is a misleading guide \n(see 581c–d and 603c), and there are many false, self-undermining \nroutes to pleasure (and fearlessness). \n\nSocrates’ indirect approach concerning happiness (cf. \n section 1.2\n above) makes sense if he thinks that justice (being just, acting\njustly) is happiness (being happy, living well) (354a). Anyone\ninclined to doubt that one should always be just would be inclined to\ndoubt that justice is happiness. So Socrates has to appeal to\ncharacteristics of happiness that do not, in his view, capture what\nhappiness is, in the hope that the skeptics might agree that happiness\ncorrelates with the absence of regret, frustration, and fear and the\npresence of pleasure. That would be enough for the proofs. \n\nEven at the end of his three “proofs,” Socrates knows that he cannot \nyet have fully persuaded Glaucon and Adeimantus that it is always \nbetter to be just than unjust. Their beliefs and desires have been \nstained too deeply by a world filled with mistakes, especially by the\nmisleading tales of the poets. To turn Glaucon and Adeimantus more \nfully toward virtue, Socrates needs to undercut their respect for the\npoets, and he needs to begin to stain their souls anew. But Socrates’\ntheoretical arguments on behalf of justice are finished. The work \nthat remains to be done—especially the sketch of a soul at the \nend of Book Nine and the myth of an afterlife in Book \nTen—should deepen without transforming our appreciation for the\npsychological ethics of the Republic. \n\nJust as Socrates develops an account of a virtuous, successful human \nbeing and contrasts it with several defective characters, he also \ndevelops an account of a virtuous, successful city and contrasts it \nwith several defective constitutions. So the Republic \ncontributes to political philosophy in two main ways. I will take \nthem up in turn, starting with four disputed features of Socrates’ \ngood city: its utopianism, communism, feminism, and totalitarianism. \n\nTo sketch a good city, Socrates does not take a currently or \npreviously extant city as his model and offer adjustments (see 422e, \nand cf. Statesman 293e). He insists on starting from \nscratch, reasoning from the causes that would bring a city into being\n(369a–b). This makes his picture of a good city an ideal, a utopia. \n\nThe Republic’s utopianism has attracted many imitators, but\nalso many critics. The critics typically claim that Plato’s political\nideal rests on an unrealistic picture of human beings. The ideal city\nis conceivable, but humans are psychologically unable to create and\nsustain such a city. According to this charge, then, Plato’s ideal\nconstitution is a nowhere-utopia (ou-topia = “no\nplace”). But if ‘ought’ implies ‘can’, then a\nconstitution that cannot exist is not one that ought to exist. So, the\nobjection goes, Plato’s ideal constitution fails to be an ideal-utopia\n(eu-topia = “good place”). \n\nTo consider the objection, we first need to distinguish two apparently\nideal cities that Socrates describes. The first, simple city is\nsketched very briefly, and is rejected by Glaucon as a “city of\npigs” though Socrates calls it “the healthy city”\n(369b–372e). It contains no provision for war, and no distinction\namong classes. The second, initially called by Socrates a\n“fevered city” and a “city of luxuries” (372e)\nbut later purified of its luxuries (see especially 399e) and\ncharacterized as a beautiful city (“Kallipolis,” 527c2), includes three\nclasses, two that guard the city and its constitution (ruling and\nauxiliary guardians) and one that produces what the city\nneeds. (At 543c–d, Glaucon suggests that one might find a third city,\nas well, by distinguishing between the three-class city whose rulers\nare not explicitly philosophers and the three-class city whose rulers\nare, but a three-class city whose rulers are not philosophers cannot\nbe an ideal city, according to Socrates (473b–e).  It is better to see\nBooks Five through Seven as clarifications of the same three-class\ncity first developed without full explicitness in Books Two through\nFour (cf. 497c–d, 499c–d).) \n\nThe charge of “utopianism” would apply well to the first city \nSocrates describes. This city resembles a basic economic model since \nSocrates uses it in theorizing how a set of people could efficiently \nsatisfy their necessary appetitive desires (Schofield 1993). At the center of his \nmodel is a principle of specialization: each person should perform \njust the task to which he is best suited. But Socrates’ model makes \nno provision for reason’s rule, and he later insists that no one can \nhave orderly appetitive attitudes unless they are ruled by reason \n(esp. 590c–d; cf. 586a–b). So the first city cannot exist, by the \nlights of the Republic’s account of human nature (Barney 2001). It is a \nnowhere-utopia, and thus not an ideal-utopia. \n\nThis is not to say that the first city is a mistake. Socrates \nintroduces the first city not as a free-standing ideal but as the \nbeginning of his account of the ideal, and his way of starting \nhighlights two features that make the eventual ideal an ideal. One is\nthe principle of specialization. With it Socrates sketches how people\nmight harmoniously satisfy their appetitive attitudes. If reason \ncould secure a society of such people, then they would be happy, and \nreason does secure a society of such people in the third class of the\nideal city. (So the model turns out to be a picture of the producers \nin Kallipolis.) But the principle can also explain how a single \nperson could flourish, for a version of it explains the optimal \nsatisfaction of all psychological attitudes (442d–444a with \n432b–434c). Indeed, this principle is central to the first “proof” \nfor the superiority of the just life. The second feature crucial to \nSocrates’ ideal enters when Glaucon insists that the first city is fit for \npigs and not human beings. He objects that it lacks \ncouches, tables, relishes, and the other things required for a \nsymposium, which is the cornerstone of civilized human life as he understands \nit (Burnyeat 1999). Glaucon is not calling for satisfaction of unnecessary appetitive\nattitudes, for the relishes he insists on are later recognized to be \namong the objects of necessary appetitive attitudes (559b). Rather, \nhe is expressing spirited indignation, motivated by a sense of what \nis honorable and fitting for a human being. He insists that there is \nmore to a good human life than the satisfaction of appetitive \nattitudes. This begins to turn Glaucon away from appetitive \nconsiderations against being just. It also completes the first city’s\nintroduction of the two kinds of arguments for the superiority of the\njust life, by appealing, as the pleasure proofs do, to the \nintrinsic value of different kinds of psychological satisfaction. \n\nDoes the “utopianism” objection apply to the second city,\nwith its philosopher-rulers, auxiliary guardians, and producers? Some\nreaders would have Plato welcome the charge. As they understand\nthe Republic, Socrates sketches the second city not as an\nideal for us to strive for but as a warning against political\nutopianism or as an unimportant analogue to the good person.  There\nare a couple of passages to support this approach. At 472b–473b,\nSocrates says that the point of his ideal is to allow us to judge\nactual cities and persons based on how well they approximate it. And\nat 592a–b, he says that the ideal city can serve as a model\n(paradeigma) were it ever to come into\nexistence or not. But these passages have to be squared with the many in\nwhich Socrates insists that the ideal city could in fact come into\nexistence (just a few: 450c–d, 456bc, 473c, 499b–d, 502a–c, 540d–e).\nHis considered view is that although the ideal city is meaningful to\nus even if it does not exist, it could exist. Of course,\nrealizing the ideal city is highly unlikely. The widespread disrepute\nof philosophy and the corruptibility of the philosophical nature\nconspire to make it extremely difficult for philosophers to gain power\nand for rulers to become philosophers (487a–502c).  Nevertheless,\naccording to what Socrates explicitly says, the ideal city is supposed\nto be realizable. The Laws imagines an impossible ideal, in\nwhich all the citizens are fully virtuous and share everything\n(739a–740 with\n Plato: on utopia),\n but the Republic is more practical than that (Burnyeat 1992; cf. Griswold 1999 and Marshall 2008). So if Plato\ndoes not intend for us to think of the\nRepublic’s ideal city as a serious goal worth striving for, \nsomething other than Socrates’ explicit professions must reveal this \nto us. I consider this possibility in \n section 6\n below. \n\nBut if Socrates would not welcome the “utopianism” charge,\ndoes he successfully avoid it? This is not clear. It is difficult to\nshow that the ideal city is inconsistent with human nature as the\nRepublic understands it. Socrates supposes that almost all \nof its citizens—not quite all (415d–e)—have to reach \ntheir fullest psychological potential, but it is not clear that \nanyone has to do more than this. \n\nNevertheless, we might make the “utopianism” charge stick by showing \nthat the Republic is wrong about human nature. This version \nof the criticism is sometimes advanced in very sweeping terms: \nPlato’s psychology is “too optimistic” about human beings because it \nunderplays self-interest, say. In these general terms, the criticism \nis false. Socrates builds his theory on acute awareness of how \ndangerous and selfish appetitive attitudes are, and indeed of how \nself-centered the pursuit of wisdom is, as well. In fact, it might be \neasier to argue in sweeping terms that the Republic’s ideal \ncity is too pessimistic about what most people are capable of, since \nit consigns most human beings to lives as slaves (433c–d, cf. \n469b–471c) or as citizens who are slavishly dependent upon others’ \nruling (590c–d). Still, more specific criticisms of Plato’s \npsychology may well be tenable, and these might even show that the \nRepublic is too optimistic about the possibility of its \nideal city. \n\nSuch criticism should be distinguished from a weaker complaint about\nthe Republic’s “utopianism.” One might concede to\nthe Republic its psychology, concede the\npossibility of the ideal city, and nevertheless insist that \nthe ideal city is so unlikely to come about as to be merely fanciful.\nA hard-nosed political scientist might have this sort of response. \nBut this sounds like nothing more than opposition to political theory\nproposing ideals that are difficult to achieve, and it is not clear \nwhat supports this opposition. It is not as though political \ntheorizing must propose ideas ready for implementation in order to \npropose ideas relevant to implementation. The \nRepublic’s ideal can affect us very generally: we can \nconsider the unity and harmony fundamental to it, and consider \nwhether our own cities and souls should be allowed to fall short in \nunity and harmony where they do. But it can also work in more \nspecific terms: we should be able to recognize and promote the \nstrategies and policies crucial to the Republic’s ideal, \nincluding careful moral education societally and habitual regulation \nof appetitive desire personally, or the equal opportunity for work \nsocietally and the development of multiple kinds of psychological \nattitudes personally. \n\nSo the Republic’s ideal city might be objectionably \nnowhere-utopian, but the point is far from obvious. Of course, even \nif it is not nowhere-utopian, it might fail to be attractively \nideal-utopian. We need to turn to other features of the second city \nthat have led readers to praise and blame it. \n\nOne of the most striking features of the ideal city is its abolition \nof private families and sharp limitation on private property in the \ntwo guardian classes. Starting with Aristotle (Politics II 1–5), this communism in the \nRepublic’s ideal city has been the target of confusion and \ncriticism (see Nussbaum 1980, Stalley 1991, Mayhew 1997). On the one hand, Aristotle (at Politics \n1264a11–22) and others have expressed uncertainty about the extent of\ncommunism in the ideal city. On the other, they have argued that communism of any extent has no place in an ideal political community. \n\nThere should be no confusion about private property. When Socrates \ndescribes the living situation of the guardian classes in the ideal \ncity (415d–417b), he is clear that private property will be sharply \nlimited, and when he discusses the kinds of regulations the rulers \nneed to have in place for the whole city (421c ff.), he is clear that\nthe producers will have enough private property to make the \nregulation of wealth and poverty a concern. But confusion about the scope\nof communal living arrangements is possible, due to the casual way in\nwhich Socrates introduces this controversial proposal. The abolition \nof private families enters as an afterthought. Socrates says that \nthere is no need to list everything that the rulers will do, for if \nthey are well educated, they will see what is necessary, including \nthe fact that “marriage, the having of wives, and the procreation of \nchildren must be governed as far as possible by the old proverb: \nfriends possess everything in common” (423e6–424a2). It is not \nimmediately clear whether this governance should extend over the \nwhole city or just the guardian classes. Still, when he is pressed to\ndefend the communal arrangements (449c ff.), Socrates focuses on the \nguardian classes (see, e.g., 461e and 464b), and it seems most \nreasonable to suppose that the communism about families extends just \nas far as the communism about property does, on the grounds that only\nthe best people can live as friends with such things in common (cf. \nLaws 739c–740b). \n\nTo what extent the communism of the ideal city is problematic is a \nmore complicated question. The critics claim that communism is\neither undesirable or impossible. The charge of impossibility essentially \nextends one of Plato’s insights: while Plato believes that most \npeople are incapable of living without private property and private \nfamilies, the critics argue that all people are incapable of living \nwithout private property. This criticism fails if there is clear \nevidence of people who live communally. But the critic can fall back \non the charge of undesirability. Here the critic needs to identify \nwhat is lost by giving up on private property and private \nfamilies, and the critic needs to show that this is more valuable \nthan any unity and extended sense of family the communal arrangements\noffer. It is not clear how this debate should go. Plato’s position on\nthis question is a stubbornly persistent ideal, despite the equally \nstubborn persistence of criticism. \n\nSocrates ties the abolition of private families among the guardian \nclasses to another radical proposal, that in the ideal city the \neducation for and job of ruling should be open to girls and women. \nThe exact relation between the proposals is contestable (Okin 1977). Is Socrates \nproposing the abolition of families in order to free up women to do \nthe work of ruling? Or is Socrates putting the women to work since \nthey will not have the job of family-caregiver anymore? But perhaps \nneither is prior to the other. Each of the proposals can be supported\nindependently, and their dovetailing effects can be claimed as a \nhappy convergence. \n\nMany readers have seen in Plato’s Republic a rare exception \nin western philosophy’s long history of sexist denigration of women, \nand some have even decided that Plato’s willingness to open up the \nbest education and the highest jobs to women shows a kind of \nfeminism (Wender 1973). Other readers disagree (Annas 1976, Buchan 1999). They point to Plato’s indifference \nto the needs of actual women in his own city, to Socrates’ frequent, \ndisparaging remarks about women and “womanish” attitudes, and to the \nilliberal reasons Socrates offers for educating and empowering women. \n\nThe broad claim that Plato or the Republic is feminist \ncannot be sustained, and the label ‘feminist’ is an \nespecially contested one, but still, there are two features of the \nRepublic’s ideal city that can be reasonably called \nfeminist. First, Socrates suggests that the distinction between male \nand female is as relevant as the distinction between having long hair\nand having short hair for the purposes of deciding who should be \nactive guardians: men and women, just like the long-haired and the \nshort-haired, are by nature the same for the assignment of education \nand jobs (454b–456b). This suggestion seems to express the plausibly \nfeminist point that one’s sex is generally irrelevant to one’s \nqualifications for education or employment. \n\nThe second plausibly feminist commitment in the Republic \ninvolves the abolition of private families. The feminist import of \nthis may be obscured by the way in which Socrates and his \ninterlocutors talk of “women and children shared in common.” In fact,\nSocrates’ companions might well have been forgiven if this way of \ntalking had called to mind pictures of orgiastic free love in the \nguardians’ camp, for that, after all, is how Aristophanes’ \nEcclesiazusae plays the proposal of “sharing women and \nchildren” for laughs. But as Socrates clarifies what he means, both \nfree love and male possessiveness turn out to be beside the point. \n(The talk of “sharing women and children” reflects the male \nperspective of the men having the conversation but not the content of\nthe proposal.) Then Socrates’ proposal can seem especially striking. \nPlato is clearly aware that an account of how the polis should be \narranged must give special attention to how families are arranged. \nRelatedly, he is clearly aware that an account of the ideal citizens \nmust explain how sexual desire, a paradigmatic appetitive attitude, \nshould fit into the good human life. Only very recently, with \nfeminist interventions, have sexual desire and its consequences come \nto seem crucial to political theory, and we might think that Plato’s \nawareness of these as topics of political philosophy shows at least \nproto-feminist concern. All the more might this awareness seem \nfeminist when we relate it back to the first plausibly feminist \ncommitment, for Plato wants the economy of desire and reproduction to\nbe organized in such a way that women are free for education and \nemployment alongside men, in the guardian classes, at any rate. \n\nThree of the objections to calling the Republic feminist say\nmore about the contest over the label ‘feminist’ than \nthey do about Plato. First, some have said that feminism requires a \nconcern for women’s rights and have then argued that Plato is not a \nfeminist on the grounds that he shows no interests in women’s \nrights. This particular argument is not quite to the point, for it \nsays nothing about Plato’s view of women per se. He is not \ninterested in women’s rights just to the extent that he is not \ninterested in anyone’s rights. Second, some have said that feminism \nrequires attention to what actual women want. Since Plato shows no \ninterest in what actual women want, he would seem on this view of \nfeminism to be anti-feminist. But the limitations of this criticism \nare apparent as soon as we realize that Plato shows no interest in \nwhat actual men want. Plato focuses instead on what women (and men) \nshould want, what they would want if they were in the best \npossible psychological condition. Actual women (and actual men), as \nwe might put Plato’s point, are subject to false consciousness. \nThird, some have insisted that feminism requires attention to and \nconcern for the particular interests and needs of women as distinct \nfrom the particular interests and needs of men. Since Plato does not \nadmit of particular women’s interests and needs, he would not, in \nthis view, be a feminist (except insofar as he accidentally promoted \nany supposed particular interests by, say, proposing the abolition of\nthe private family). Again, however, this objection turns on what we \nunderstand by ‘feminism’ more than on what Socrates is \nsaying in the Republic. There should be no doubt that there \nare conceptions of feminism according to which the Republic \nis anti-feminist. But this does not undercut the point that the \nRepublic advances a couple of plausibly feminist concerns. \n\nBetter ground for doubting Plato’s apparent feminist commitments lies\nin the reasons that Socrates gives for them: Socrates consistently \nemphasizes concern for the welfare of the whole city, but not for\nwomen themselves (esp. 456c ff.). But Socrates’ emphasis in Book Five\non the happiness of the city as a whole rather than the happiness of \nthe rulers (and cf. 465e–466c) might have more to do with his worries\nabout convincing his interlocutors that ideal rulers do not flourish \nby exploiting the ruled. Thus, his emphasis need not be taken to \nrepresent a lack of concern for the women’s interests. After all,\nwhat greater concern could Socrates show for the women than to insist\nthat they be fully educated and allowed to hold the highest offices? \nSocrates goes on to argue that the philosopher-rulers of the city, \nincluding the female philosopher-rulers, are as happy as human beings can be. \n\nThe best reason for doubting Plato’s feminism is provided by those \ndisparaging remarks about women. We might try to distinguish between \nPlato’s rather harsh view of the women around him and his more \noptimistic view of women as they would be in more favorable \ncircumstances (Vlastos 1989). It is also possible to distinguish between the \ntraditional sexist tropes as they feature in Plato’s drama and the \nrejection of sexism in Plato’s ideas. But it is not clear that these \ndistinctions will remove all of the tension, especially when Socrates\nand Glaucon are saying that men are stronger or better than women in \njust about every endeavor (455c). \n\nFinal judgment on this question is difficult (see also Saxonhouse 1976, Levin 1996, E. Brown 2002). The disparaging remarks\nhave to be taken one-by-one, as it is doubtful that all can be \nunderstood in exactly the same way. Moreover, it is of the utmost \nimportance to determine whether each remark says something about the \nway all women are by nature or essentially. If Plato thinks that \nwomen are essentially worse than men, then Socrates’ claim that men \nand women have the same nature for education and employment is \npuzzling. But if the disparagements do not express any considered \nviews about the nature of women, then we might be able to conclude \nthat Plato is deeply prejudiced against women and yet committed to \nsome plausibly feminist principles. \n\nSome of the most heated discussions of the politics of Plato’s \nRepublic have surrounded the charge of totalitarianism \nfamously advanced by Karl Popper ([1945] 1971). Like the other “isms” we have been considering, \ntotalitarianism applies to the Republic only conditionally, \ndepending on the definition of ‘totalitarianism’ offered.\nBut it is worth thinking through the various ways in which this \ncharge might be made, to clarify the way the philosopher-rulers wield\npolitical authority over the rest of the city (see Bambrough 1967, Taylor 1986, L. Brown 1998, and Ackrill 1997). \n\nCritics of Plato’s Republic have characterized the aims of\nKallipolis’ rulers as totalitarian. Socrates is quite explicit that\nthe good at which the rulers aim is the unity of the city (462a–b). Is\nthis an inherently totalitarian and objectionable aim? \n\nThe problem, Popper and others have charged, is that the rulers aim \nat the organic unity of the city as a whole, regardless of the \nindividual interests of the citizens. But this would \nbe surprising, if true. After all, the Republic provides a \npicture not just of a happy city but also of a happy individual \nperson, and in Book One, Socrates argues that the ruler’s task is to \nbenefit the ruled. So how could the rulers of Kallipolis utterly \ndisregard the good of the citizens? \n\nSome readers answer Popper by staking out a diametrically opposed\nposition (Vlastos 1977). They maintain that Plato conceives of the city’s good as\nnothing more than the aggregate good of all the citizens. On this\nview, citizens need to contribute to the city’s happiness only because\nthey need to contribute to the happiness of other citizens if they are\nto achieve their own maximal happiness. Any totalitarian control of\nthe citizens is paternalistic.  Yet this view, too, seems at odds with\nmuch of the Republic.  When Socrates says that the happiest\ncity is a maximally unified city (462a–b), or when he insists that all\nthe citizens need to be bound together (519e–520a), he seems to be\ninvoking a conception of the city’s good that is not reducible to the\naggregate good of the citizens. \n\nSo a mixed interpretation seems to be called for (Morrison 2001; cf. Kamtekar 2001, Meyer 2004, and Brennan 2004). In the \nRepublic, the good of the city and the good of the \nindividual are independently specifiable, and the citizens’ own \nmaximal good coincides with the maximal good of the city. Since Plato\nbelieves that this coincidence is realized only through \npropagandistic means in the ideal city, the propaganda is \npaternalistically targeted at the citizens’ own good but not \nexclusively at the citizens’ own good. On this view, if the citizens \ndo not see themselves as parts of the city serving the city, neither \nthe city nor they will be maximally happy. \n\nThis does not leave Kallipolis’ aims beyond reproach, for one might\nwell be skeptical of the good of unity, of Plato’s assumption that\nindividuals reap their own maximal good when the city is most unified,\nor of the Republic’s claims about how this unity (and these\nindividual goods) might be achieved. But it is not obvious that the\nrulers of Kallipolis have inherently totalitarian and objectionable\naims (cf. Kamtekar 2004). \n\nKallipolis has more clearly totalitarian features. First, totalitarian regimes concentrate \npolitical power in one bloc and offer the ruled no \nalternative. The ideal city of Plato’s \nRepublic is plainly totalitarian in this respect.  \n\nBut the concentration of political power in Kallipolis differs in at \nleast two ways from the concentration in actual totalitarian states. \nFirst, Socrates insists that in the ideal city, all the citizens will\nagree about who should rule. This agreement is the city’s moderation \n(430d–432a), caused by the city’s justice (433b, cf. 351d). Socrates \nalso suggests some ways of explaining how the non-philosophers will \nagree that the philosophers should rule. First, he offers a way of \npersuading those who lack knowledge that only the philosophers have \nknowledge (476d–480a), which in effect offers a way of explaining to \nthe non-philosophers that only the philosophers have the knowledge \nrequired to rule. Second, he suggests that the non-philosophers will \nbe struck by the philosophers’ obvious virtue (500d–502a). (Their \nvirtue would be especially striking to the producers, since the \nphilosophers do without private property, which the producers love so\nmuch.) Finally, he suggests that in Kallipolis, the producers will be\ngrateful to the guardian classes for keeping the city safe and \norderly, wherein they can achieve their good, as they see it, by \noptimally satisfying their necessary appetitive attitudes (463a–b). \n\nThe second way in which Kallipolis’ concentration of political power\nis special that it does not concentrate anything good for the\nrulers. Socrates is clear that the philosophers despise political\npower (519c, 540a), and they rule not to reap rewards but for the sake\nof the ruled (cf. 341c–343a), because their justice obligates them to\nobey the law that commands them to rule (see\n section 2.3\n above). In fact, the rulers of Kallipolis benefit the ruled as best \nthey can, helping them realize the best life they are capable of. \nThese benefits must include some primary education for the producer \nclass (see 414d), to make good on the commitment to promote \nespecially talented children born among the producers (415c, 423d) \nand to enable the producers to recognize the virtue in the \nphilosophers. But the benefits extend to peace and order: the \nproducers do not have to face warfare. \n\nA second totalitarian feature of Kallipolis is the control that the\nrulers exert over daily life. There is nothing especially totalitarian\nabout the rule of law pervasive in Kallipolis (see esp. 415d–e, and\ncf. the laws that apply to the rulers, such as the marriage law and\nthe law commanding philosophers to rule) (Meyer 2006 and Hitz 2009). But the rulers control mass\nculture in the ideal city, and they advance a “noble lie”\nto convince citizens of their unequal standing and deep tie to the\ncity (414b–415d). This propagandistic control plainly represents a\ntotalitarian concern, and it should make us skeptical about the value\nof the consent given to the rulers of Kallipolis. \n\nIt is one thing to identify totalitarian features of Kallipolis and\nanother thing to say why they are wrong. Three very different\nobjections suggest themselves. First, we might reject the idea of an\nobjectively knowable human good, and thus reject the idea that\npolitical power should be in the hands of those who know the human\ngood. Here we should distinguish between Plato’s picture of the human\ngood and the very idea of an objective human good, for even if we want\nto dissent from Plato’s view, we might still accept the very idea. At\nleast, it does not seem implausible to suppose that some general\npsychological capacities are objectively good for their possessors\n(while others are objectively bad), and at that point, we can ask\nwhether political power should be used to foster the good capacities\nand to restrain or prevent the bad ones. Given that state-sponsored\neducation cannot but address the psychological capacities of the\npupils, only very austere political systems could be supported by a\nthorough-going skepticism about the human good. \n\nSecond, we might accept the idea of an objectively knowable human \ngood, but be wary of concentrating extensive political power in the \nhands of a few knowers. We might reject Plato’s apparent optimism \nabout the trustworthiness of philosopher-rulers and insist on greater\nchecks upon political power, to minimize the risks of abuse. If this \nis our objection, then we might wonder what checks are optimal. \n\nFinally, we might reject Plato’s scheme on the grounds that political\nself-determination and free expression are themselves more valuable \nthan Plato recognizes. This sort of response is perhaps the most \ninteresting, but it is by no means easy. For it is difficult to \nassess the intrinsic value of self-determination and free expression,\napart from skepticism about the knowledge or power of those who would limit \nself-determination or free expression. Moreover, it is difficult to \nbalance these values against the concerns that motivate Plato. Where \ndoes the power over massive cultural forces lie when it is not under \npolitical control? And to what extent can we live well when our \nculture is not shaped by people thoughtfully dedicated to living a \ngood human life? These are not questions that can be easily shrugged \noff, even if we cannot embrace Kallipolis as their answer. \n\nThe best human life is ruled by knowledge and especially knowledge of\nwhat goodness is and of what is good for human beings. So, too, is \nthe best city. For Plato, philosophers make the ideal rulers for two \nmain reasons. First, they know what is good. Second, they do not want\nto rule (esp. 520e–521b). The problem with existing cities is \ncorrespondingly twofold. They are ruled by people who are ignorant of\nwhat is good, and they suffer from strife among citizens all of whom \nwant to rule. These flaws are connected: the ignorant are \nmarked by their desire for the wrong objects, such as honor and \nmoney, and this desire is what leads them to seek political power. \nAll existing regimes, whether ruled by one, a few, or many, \nshow these defects. So in the Republic Socrates does not \ndistinguish between good and bad forms of these three kinds of \nregime, as the Stranger does in the Plato’s Statesman \n(301a–303b, cf. Aristotle, Politics III 7). \n\nNonetheless, Socrates has much to say in Books Eight and Nine about\nthe individual character of various defective regimes. He organizes\nhis account to emphasize appetite’s corrupting power, showing how each\ndefective regime can, through the corruption of the rulers’ appetites,\ndevolve into a still worse one (Hitz 2010, Johnstone 2011). In the timocracy, for example, nothing\nchecks the rulers from taking money to be a badge of honor and feeding\ntheir appetites, which grow in private until they cannot be hidden\nanymore. The account is thus deeply informed by psychology. It does\nnot purport to be an account of what has happened (despite Aristotle’s\ntreatment of it in Politics V 12), any more than Books Two\nthrough Seven purport to give an historical account of an ideal city’s\ngenesis. It is not, for all that, ahistorical, for Plato’s concerns\nabout corruption are clearly informed by his experiences and his\nunderstanding of history. The account, psychologically and\nhistorically informed, does not offer any hint of psychological or\nhistorical determinism. Socrates does not identify the transitions\nfrom one defective regime to the next as inevitable, and he explicitly\nallows for transitions other than the ones he highlights. This is just\none story one could tell about defective regimes. But this particular\nstory is valuable as a morality tale: it highlights the defective\nregimes’ vulnerability to the corruption of the rulers’ appetites. \n\nThe political psychology of Books Eight and Nine raises a host of \nquestions, especially about the city-soul analogy (see \n section 1.3\n above). Is the account of political change dependent upon the account\nof psychological change, or vice versa? Or if this is a case of \nmutual interdependence, exactly what accounts for the various \ndependencies? It seems difficult to give just one answer to these \nquestions that will explain all of the claims in these books, and the\nfull, complex theory that must underlie all of the claims is by no \nmeans clear. \n\nBut those questions should not obscure the political critiques that\nSocrates offers. First, he criticizes the oligarchs of Athens and\nSparta. His list of five regimes departs from the usual list of rule\nby one, rule by a few, and rule by many (cf.  338d) because he\ndistinguishes among three different regimes in which only a few\nrule. He contrasts the ideal city, in which the wise rule, and two\nwould-be aristocracies, the timocracy in which the militaristically\n“virtuous” rule and the oligarchy in which the rich\nrule. Socrates argues that these are not genuine aristocracies,\nbecause neither timocracy nor oligarchy manages to check the greed\nthat introduces injustice and strife into cities. This highlights the\ndeficiencies of the Spartan oligarchy, with its narrow attention to\nvalor (cf. Laws, esp. Books One and Two), and of the Athenian\noligarchs, many of whom pursued their own material interests narrowly,\nhowever much they eyed Sparta as a model. So the\nRepublic distances Plato from oligarchic parties of his time\nand place. \n\nSecond, Socrates criticizes the Athenian democracy, as Adeimantus\nremarks (563d). Many readers think that Socrates goes over the top in\nhis description, but the central message is not so easy to\ndismiss. Socrates argues that without some publicly entrenched\nstandards for evaluation guiding the city, chaos and strife are\nunavoidable. Even the timocracy and oligarchy, for all their flaws,\nhave public standards for value. But democracy honors all pursuits\nequally, which opens the city to conflict and disorder. \n\nSome readers find a silver lining in this critique. They note that \nthe democracy’s tolerance extends to philosophers (cf. 561c–d), \nallowing such things as the conversation that Socrates, Glaucon, and \nthe others are having (557d). But the Republic also records considerable \nskepticism about democratic tolerance of philosophers (487a–499a, cf.\n517a), and does not say that only a democracy could tolerate philosophers. \n\nStill, some readers have tried to bring \nthe Republic’s judgment of democracy into line with the \nStatesman, where the Stranger ranks democracy above \noligarchy. I doubt that Socrates explicit ranking in the Republic should count for less than some imagined implicit ranking, but we might still wonder what to make of the apparent contrast between the Republic and Statesman. Perhaps the difference is insignificant, since both democracies and oligarchies are beset by the same essential\nstrife between the rich (oligarchs) and poor (democrats)\n(422e–423a). Perhaps, too, the Republic and Statesman\nappear to disagree only because Plato has different criteria in\nview. Or perhaps he just changed his mind. The ideal city of\nthe Laws, which Plato probably wrote shortly after\nthe Statesman, accords a greater political role for unwise\ncitizens than the Republic does (see\n Plato: on utopia).\n  \n\nThe Republic is a sprawling work with dazzling details and \nan enormously wide-ranging influence. But what, in the end, does the \nwork say to us, insofar as we are trying to live well or help our \nsociety live well, and what does it say to us, insofar as we are \ntrying to understand how to think about how to live well? \n\nIn ethics, the Republic’s main practical lesson is that one\nshould, if one can, pursue wisdom and that if one cannot, one should\nfollow the wisest guides one can find. This lesson is familiar from\nPlato’s Socratic dialogues: the philosophical life is best, and if one\nlacks knowledge, one should prefer to learn from an expert. But\nthe Republic characterizes philosophy differently. First, it\ngoes much further than the Socratic dialogues in respecting the power\nof passions and desires. Wisdom still requires being able to survive\nSocratic examination (534b–c), but it also explicitly requires careful\nand extensive habituation of spirited and appetitive\nattitudes (485a–486b, 519a8–b1), sublimation of\npsychological energy from spirited and appetitive desires to\nphilosophical desire (cf. 485d), and continued attention to and\nmaintenance of the desires that arise from the non-calculating parts\nof one’s soul (571d–572b, 589a–b, cf. 416e–417b). Second, as opposed\nto the Socrates of the Socratic dialogues, who avows ignorance and\nis content with the belief that the world is well-ordered, the Socrates of\nthe Republic insists that wisdom requires understanding how\nthe world is, which involves apprehending the basic mathematical and\nteleological structure of things. Third, although the Socrates of the\nSocratic dialogues practices philosophy instead of living an\nordinarily engaged political life, he insists that his life is closer\nto what the political art demands than the ordinarily engaged life\nis. According to the Republic, by contrast, the philosopher\nprefers to be entirely apart from politics, especially in ordinary\ncircumstances (496c–e, 592a, cf. 520a–b). \n\nOne facet of this advice that deserves emphasizing is the importance \nit places on the influence of others. Plato plainly believes that \none’s living well depends upon one’s fellows and the larger culture. \nThis is most obvious in the case of those who cannot pursue wisdom \nfor themselves. They will live as well as those who lead them allow. \nBut even those who can pursue wisdom must first be raised well and \nmust later meet with tolerance, which philosophers do not often \nreceive.  \n\nThe ethical theory the Republic offers is best characterized\nas eudaimonist, according to which a person should act for the sake of\nhis or her own success or happiness (eudaimonia). Socrates\ndoes not argue for this as opposed to other approaches to\nethics. Rather, he simply assumes that a person’s success gives him or\nher conclusive reasons to act, and he argues that success requires\nacting virtuously. This eudaimonism is widely thought to be an\negoistic kind of consequentialism: one should act so as to bring about\nstates of affairs in which one is happy or successful. But there is no\nreason to suppose that the\nRepublic rejects the identity of eudaimonia and \ngood activity (eu prattein, eupragia) which \nSocrates often assumes in Plato’s Socratic dialogues \n(Charmides 171e–172a, Crito 48b, \nEuthydemus 278e–282d, Gorgias 507c). If\nthe Republic takes this identity seriously, as the function\nargument of Book One does (354a), it says that virtuous activity is\ngood not because it brings about success, but because it\nis success. This is also the explicit view of Aristotle and the\nStoics, who had considered Plato’s work carefully. \n\nMetaethically, the Republic presupposes that there are\nobjective facts concerning how one should live. Much of its account of\nthese facts sounds naturalist. After all, Socrates uses the careful\nstudy of human psychology to reveal how our souls function well or\nill, and he grounds the account of what a person should do in his\nunderstanding of good psychological functioning. Socrates’ particular\ndeployment of this general strategy suggests that good actions are\nthose that sustain the virtuous soul (443e) and that the virtuous soul\nis the one with a maximally unified set of commitments (443d–e,\ncf. 534b–c). Whether this is plausible depends upon what careful study\nof human psychology in fact shows. It depends in particular on\nwhether, as a matter of fact, the actions that we would\npre-theoretically deem good sustain a coherent set of psychological\ncommitments and those that we would pre-theoretically deem bad are\ninconsistent with a coherent set of psychological commitments. Ethical\nnaturalism such as this still awaits support from psychology, but it\nhas not been falsified, either. \n\nAlthough this naturalist reading of the Republic is not\nanachronistic—Aristotle and the Stoics develop related\nnaturalist approaches, and Plato had naturalist contemporaries in a\nhedonist tradition—Plato himself would not be content to ground\nhis account of good actions on empirical facts of human psychology.\nOn his view, actions are good because of their relation to good\nagents, and agents are good because of their relation to goodness\nitself. But goodness itself, the Good, transcends the natural world;\nit is a supernatural property. This commits Plato to a non-naturalist\nversion of ethical realism, which modernity’s creeping tide of\nnaturalism threatens to wash away. But non-naturalism in ethics will\nretain some appeal insofar as the other ways of trying to explain our\nexperiences of the moral life fail to answer the serious objections\nthey face. \n\nThe take-home lessons of the Republic’s politics are subject\nto special controversy. In the sections above, I take what Socrates \nsays about the ideal and defective cities at face value, but many \nreaders believe that this is a mistake. Some think that Plato does \nnot intend the Republic as a serious contribution to \npolitical thought, because its political musings are projections to \nclarify psychological claims crucial to the ethical theory that Plato\ndoes seriously intend (Annas 1999, Annas 2000). Others think that Plato intends \npolitical lessons strikingly different from what is suggested by the \nface value of Socrates’ words.  \n\nOne can concede that the Republic’s politics are a \nreflection of its moral psychology without thinking that they are \nmerely that. In antiquity, starting with Aristotle, Plato’s \nRepublic was recognized as part of a large genre of \npolitically serious works, many of them inspired by Sparta (Menn 2005), and \nSocrates’ explicit claims about the ideal and defective constitutions\nwere taken seriously as political proposals. \n\nMoreover, one can concede that the Republic calls into \nquestion many of its political proposals without thinking that Plato \nmeans to cancel them or suggest other, radically different political \nadvice (cf. Clay 1988). It is striking that Socrates is ready to show that it is \nbetter to be just than unjust before he has even said that \nthe just and wise person must be a philosopher and that the just city\nmust be ruled by philosophers (444e–445a). It is also striking that \nAdeimantus enthusiastically endorses the idea of “holding the women \nand children in common” (424a) and then later asks Socrates to \nexplain it (449c–450a). And it is striking that Socrates recognizes \nthat Greeks would ridicule his proposal that women take up the arts \nof war (452a). But Plato might signal for his readers to examine and \nre-examine what Socrates says without thereby suggesting that he \nhimself finds fault with what Socrates says.  \n\nBut still some readers, especially Leo Strauss (see Strauss 1964) and his followers (e.g., Bloom 1968 and Bloom 1977), want to \ndistance the Republic’s take-home political message from \nKallipolis. They typically appeal to three considerations that are \nsupposed to indicate Plato’s awareness that the political ideal is \nimpossible or ruinous. First, they note that the philosophers have to\nbe compelled to rule the ideal city. But this involves no \nimpossibility. The founders of the ideal city would have to make a \nlaw compelling those educated as philosophers to rule (cf. \n section 2.3\n above), but founders could make such a law. If philosophers have to \nbe compelled to sustain the maximally happy city, one might wonder \nwhy anyone would found such a city. But one might wonder why anyone \nwas inspired to compose the Oresteia, as well. People sometimes\ndo remarkable things. Second, Straussian readers appeal to the ideal \ncity’s predicted demise, and they assert that the rulers’ eventual \ninability to calculate “the marriage number” (546a–547a) shows an \nineliminable conflict between the eros in human nature and the \nmathematical perfection of a political ideal. But it is also possible\nto blame the anticipated degeneration on sense-perception (see \n546b2–3), not calculation, and to see in Kallipolis’ demise a common \nfact of life for perceptible entities (546a2). After all, Socrates does\nnot say that eros makes the creation or maintenance of Kallipolis \nimpossible. Finally, the Straussians note that Kallipolis is not \nsketched as an ideal in a political treatise, exactly, but proposed \nby Socrates in a long dramatic conversation, which includes twists \nand turns that come after he stops discussing Kallipolis. \nThis is true, and it renders difficult inferences from what is said \nin the Republic to what Plato thinks. But it does not \nprovide any reason for thinking that Plato rejects the ideal\nthat Socrates constructs in the Republic. \n\nIn fact, Socrates expresses several central political theses in the \nRepublic that appear in other Platonic dialogues, as well, \nespecially in the Gorgias, Statesman, and \nLaws. First, the best rulers are wise. Second, the best\nrulers rule for the benefit of the ruled, and not for their own\nsake. Third, a city is highly unlikely to have the best rulers, in\npart because there is a gulf between the values of most people and the\nvalues of the wise. Fourth, the greatest harm to a city is\ndisagreement about who should rule, since competing factions create\ncivil strife.  So, fifth, a central goal of politics is harmony or agreement\namong the citizens about who should rule. Last, harmony requires that\nthe city cultivate virtue and the rule of law. The consistency of\nthese messages across several Platonic dialogues might well make us so\nbold as to think that they are the take-home message of\nthe Republic’s politics.
