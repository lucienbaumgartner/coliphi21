Among the traditional Buddhist thinkers of Japan,\nand perhaps even of the whole of East Asia, he is one of the most\nsystematic and philosophical. He is most famous for being the founder\nof Shingon esoteric Buddhism in Japan. But he is also remembered not\nonly for his contributions as a teacher and scholar of religion, but\nfor his accomplishments and innovations in social welfare, public\neducation, lexicography, language, literature and poetry, literary\ntheory, calligraphy, art, painting, wood-carving, sculpture, music,\ncivil engineering, architecture, etc. during a period when Japan was\nundergoing rapid change. In this essay, we shall restrict our account\nto his philosophy.\n\n\n\nKūkai grew up during the Nara period (710–784CE) when the\nNara Buddhist schools flourished and the country was centralized under\nthe rule of the imperial family. And he was active during the\nbeginning of the Heian period (794–1185CE) when\ninstitutionalized Nara Buddhism underwent reform due to the influence\nof newer ideas coming from China, including Kūkai’s own\nimportations. He comes from an aristocratic family, the Saeki, and as\na boy, he was educated by his maternal uncle, a Confucian scholar. At\nthe age of seventeen or eighteen, he entered the state university at\nthe then-capital Nagaoka but was soon disillusioned with its Confucian\neducation. He suddenly dropped out of the university and retired into\nthe natural setting of the mountains, where as legend has it, he\ndevoted himself to various forms of esoteric practices. A few years\nlater at the age of 24, he completed the final version of his first\ntreatise, the Sangô shîki (Indications of the Goals\nof the Three Teachings) that covers and compares the teachings of\nConfucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. Herein one can discern\nKūkai’s reasons for turning from Confucianism to Buddhism. In\nthe text, Kūkai relates how as a student he met a Buddhist\npriest who taught him an esoteric meditative practice called the\nKokûzôgumonji no ho\n(“Âkâśagarbha’s method for seeking hearing and\nretaining”), which involved the recitation of a mantra a million\ntimes and was supposed to endow the practitioner with miraculous\npowers of memory and understanding. \n\nWhat Kūkai found in Buddhism was a concrete path towards\nenlightenment (and liberation from suffering) that involves bodily\npractice and direct experience rather than mere theoretical\nspeculation. Kūkai however did not involve himself in the\nofficial schools of the Nara Buddhist orthodoxy for they emphasized\nthe exegetical study of the scriptures without providing any\ntheoretical grounding for ritual practice. Instead he remained in the\nremote mountain regions of his native Shikoku as an unofficial and\nprivately ordained mendicant. It appears that between the ages of 24\nand 31, he wandered through its various mountains and sacred sites,\npracticing asceticism. Noticing the many different branches and\nsûtras (scriptures) of Buddhism, he hoped to find its\nunifying essence that would also bridge the gap between ritual and\nexperience on the one hand and doctrine and theory on the other\nhand. It was during this search that he came across the mid-seventh\ncentury esoteric Buddhist text of the Dainichi-kyô\n(Skrt: Mahâvairocana Sûtra; Chn: Ta-ji\nChing; “Great Sun scripture”). Intuiting that this\ntext, with its dual emphasis upon esoteric practice and doctrine,\nwould provide the kind of knowledge that he was seeking, Kūkai\ndecided to travel to China to study it. \n\nIt was only in 804 at the age of 30 or 31 that Kūkai was thus\nofficially ordained so that he could travel with an official\ngovernment embassy to China. He travelled to Ch’ang-an, the\ngreat cosmopolitan capital of the T’ang (Tang) dynasty, where he\nresided for thirty months. During this period, he studied Indian\nBuddhism, Hindu teachings, and Sanskrit with two Indian monks.  But\nmore significantly he met Hui-kuo (Huiguo; Jpn: Keika)\n(746–805), the seventh patriarch of Chen-yen (Zhenyan; Jpn:\nShingon; Skrt: Mantrayâna) Buddhism, from whom he received\ninitiation into the two lineages of Chen-yen esoteric Buddhism, one\ncentered around the Vajradhâtu (Diamond realm) mandala based on\nthe Vajraśekhara Sûtra (“Adamantine {or\nDiamond} Pinnacle scripture”) and the other focussing upon the\nGarbha (Womb) mandala based on the Mahâvairocana\nSûtra. Kūkai’s accomplishment during his stay in\nChina is phenomenal in that not only did he manage to succeed Hui-kuo\nin becoming the eighth patriarch of esoteric Buddhism, he also managed\nto study Sanskrit, Chinese poetry and calligraphy, and various other\nminor arts. \n\nKūkai returned to Japan in 806 at the age of 33. He arrived in\nKyushu with a voluminous amount of sûtras, collections of\nmandala paintings, treatises and commentaries, books of poetry, and\nritual paraphernalia. In Kyushu, he composed the Shorai\nmokuroku (A Memorial Presenting a List of Newly Imported\nSûtras and Other Items) that gives a brief account of his\nactivities in China, describes what distinguishes esoteric Buddhism,\nand lists the items he had collected and brought back to Japan.\nHowever he was not permitted to enter the capital due to political\nunrest and was obliged to remain in Kyushu for another three\nyears. Only with the retirement of Emperor Heizei (r. 806–809),\ndid the new Emperor Saga order Kūkai in 809 to move to the new\ncapital of Kyoto to reside at Takaosan-ji, the center of the Kyoto\nBuddhist world, where he remained until 823. Under the patronage of\nthe new emperor, Kūkai became appointed over the years to\nvarious administrative positions of several important official\ntemples. This allowed him to perform the first public esoteric ritual\nfor “nation-protection,” followed by other public esoteric\nceremonies, including mass initiation rituals and the founding of an\nannual ritual (the Mishuhô) to be held at court, hence\ngaining official recognition for the efficacy of esoteric Buddhism and\npreparing the rise of Buddhism as an ideological force in medieval\nJapan. \n\nIt was during his period at Takaosan-ji that he wrote some of his\nmajor treatises of philosophical interest to us, such as\nBenkenmitsu nikkyôron (Treatise on the Differences\nBetween Esoteric and Exoteric Teachings) around 814, and the\nso-called Sanbu-sho (“Three Writings”) of\nSokushinjôbutsugi (On the Meaning of\n“Attaining Buddhahood in this Very Embodied\nExistence”), Shôjijissôgi (On the\nMeanings of “Sound, Sign, and Reality”), and\nUnjigi (On the Meaning of the Syllable\nHûm) in the 820s. And towards the end of his life\nhe completed in 830 what has been considered to be his magnum\nopus, the Himitsu mandara jûjûshinron\n(Treatise on the Ten States of the Mind as a Secret\nMandala) in ten volumes, and soon afterward,\ncompleted its summary version, the Hizô hôyaku\n(The Precious Key to the Secret Treasury) in three volumes.\n\n \n\nIn 816 Kūkai began building a monastic center in Mt. Kôya,\nand there he died in 835 at the age of 61. In 921, he posthumously\nreceived from Emperor Daigo and his court, the honorific title,\nKôbô Daishi (“Great Teacher Who Spread the\nDharma”). \n\nKūkai called his form of Buddhism, Shingon, which\nmeans “the word of truth.” This is the Japanese\npronunciation of the Chinese chen-yen (zhenyan) and\nthe Sanskrit mantra. The form of Buddhism that he learned in\nChina was an importation from India of Mantrayâna\n(Mantra vehicle {or: “school”}) Buddhism, more often known\nas Vajrayâna (Diamond {or: “Lightning Fast”}\nvehicle). The word mantra signifies a secret teaching\ninexpressible in ordinary words or linguistic formulations. This form\nof Buddhism, whose origin dates back to the mid-seventh century India,\nis more popularly known today in the West as “Tantric\nBuddhism,” especially in its Tibetan incarnation. It is\ncharacterized by its emphasis upon rituals, involving the use of\nmantras, mandalas, and other means in order to control both body and\nmind to experience the “ultimate.” Two major texts,\nassociated with this form of Buddhism, made their way into China from\nIndia: Mahâvairocana Sûtra (Jpn:\nDainichi-kyô) from the mid-seventh century and\nVajraśekhara Sûtra (Jpn:\nKongôchô-gyô) from the later-seventh\ncentury. Mantrayâna made its way east to China during the\nT’ang dynasty (713–765) around the beginning of the eighth\ncentury through the translating and propagating efforts of the Indian\npriests Śubhâkarasimha (Jpn: Zenmui; 637–735) who\nbrought the Mahâvairocana Sûtra to China;\nVajrabodhi (Jpn: Kongôchi; 671–741), the sixth patriarch of\nMantrayâna, who brought the Vajraśekhara\nSûtra to China; and Amoghavajra (Jpn: Fukû, an\nabbreviation for Fukûkongô; 705–74), Vajrabodhi’s\ndisciple, who won the support of successive emperors during the\nT’ang period; and the Chinese priest, I-hsing (Yixing; Jpn:\nIchigyô; 683–727) who learned the teachings of\nMahâvairocana Sûtra from Śubhâkarasimha\nand the teachings of Vajraśekhara Sûtra from\nVarjabodhi. Kūkai’s own teacher Hui-kuo had also received\ninitiation under both lineages of these two major sûtras, and\nis credited with gathering together their teachings into one\nsystem. In the meantime during the eighth century, another branch of\nMantrayâna made it north from India to Tibet. But Chen-yen\nBuddhism in China did not survive the severe persecution of Buddhism\nin general in 845. Kūkai however had by then already succeeded\nin transmitting to Japan the esoteric doctrines he had studied in\nChina. For much of the doctrines and practices, which he had imported,\nbecame influential amongst the official Nara monasteries. But his form\nof Buddhism was not just a product of his inheritance and\nappropriation of the Buddhism he encountered in China. As it involved\ndevelopments and contributions uniquely his own, we may regard him not\nonly as the transmitter but as the founder of the Japanized\nversion of Mantrayâna known as Shingon. \n\nKūkai has been regarded as the first comprehensively\nphilosophical thinker in Japanese intellectual history. The influence\nof Mahâyâna philosophy is noticeable but they are\ninterpreted through the lens of Mantrayâna with its emphasis upon\nthe inseparability of ritual practice from theoretical doctrine.\nTraditionally, his thought has been divided into the following\naspects: 1) the theoretical (kyôsô) which\nexplicates the uniqueness and distinction of esoteric Buddhism\n(mikkyô) as opposed to exoteric Buddhism\n(kengyô) and demonstrates its validity and\nefficaciousness; and 2) the practical (jisô), which\nprescribes his method of meditation and ritual. Ultimately however the\ntheoretical and the practical are inseparable in Kūkai’s\nthought. Within the deep profundity and subtleties of his doctrine,\none recognizes philosophical elements inherited from Madhyamaka,\nYogâcâra, T’ien-t’ai (Tiantai), and Huayen (Huayan) Buddhist\nthought. But with these are incorporated the elements of devotional\npiety and magico-esoteric practice even in his theoretical\nwritings. What is especially pronounced and distinct in his thought is\nthe significance of bodily experience and practice. Buddhist truths\nfor Kūkai were not simply meant to be intellectually mused over\nbut to be experienced through bodily practice. One might say\nthen that for Kūkai it is the body that provides the medium\nwhereby theory and practice, doctrine and ritual, thought and\nexperience, are non-dualistic. \n\nA major contribution made by Kūkai for the orthodoxy of Nara\nBuddhism with his systematization of esoteric doctrines, was to bridge\nthe gap between textual study and ritual practice.  Kūkai’s\nworks provided for the first time a theoretical grounding for the\nincantation of mantras and dhâranīs and other\nesoteric practices already present in Nara Buddhism. It did this by\nexplicating their relationship to the doctrines expressed in the\nscriptural texts.  While esoteric elements were already present in\nNara Buddhism, their very raison d’etre, other than as\nforms of magic, and their very connection to Buddhist doctrines had\nbeen left in the dark. Kūkai’s success may be attributable to\nhis ability to provide a sound and intelligible systematic exposition\nof the meanings of the esoteric elements of Buddhism and of the\ninterrelationships between text, ritual, and icon. In doing so it\nsucceeded in bridging the gap between esoteric rituals and scriptural\ndoctrines. (Abe 1999, 11) Kūkai had to work out such an\nexposition in order to establish and legitimize the independence and\nrole of his Shingon Buddhism vis-à-vis the other forms of\nBuddhism already existent in Nara Japan. \n\nOf Kūkai’s so-called theoretical works, the philosophically\nmost significant are Benkenmitsu nikkyôron, Himitsu\nmandara jûjûshinron, Hizô\nhôyaku, Sokushinjôbutsugi,\nShôjijissôgi, and Unjigi. The former three\nprovide comparative analyses exploring what distinguishes Shingon\nesoteric Buddhism from other forms of religious thought and practice,\nincluding the exoteric forms of Buddhism. The latter three are\nexpositions of the Shingon worldview and its concepts, and are grouped\ntogether to comprise the so-called Sanbu-sho\n(“Three Writings”). Benkenmitsu nikkyôron (2\nvols.)  written in 814/815 sets forth the differences between esoteric\nand exoteric Buddhism to emphasize the superiority of the\nformer. Starting from this foundation (i.e. of the distinction and\nsuperiority of the esoteric standpoint), Kūkai composed the\nSanbu-sho, in rapid succession from around 821 to\n824. These “Three Writings” provide expositions of what\ncommentators have called the “metaphysics” of Shingon,\ndealing in detail with the three so-called mysterious aspects of the\ncosmic truth (Dharma): its “body, speech, and mind.”\nSokushinjôbutsugi explicates the concept of\nsokushinjôbutsu or enlightenment in one’s immediate\nembodied existence. Shôjijissôgi and Unjigi\nare unique works of a “metaphysical linguistics.” They\nexamine the interrelationship (which is ultimately non-dualistic)\nbetween the phenomenal world, its sounds (or “voices”) as\n“signs” (or “letters”), and reality itself,\nthe “meaning,” they convey. In doing so, those two works\nexplicate the Shingon concept of hosshin seppô, the\nBuddha’s preaching of the Dharma via cosmic phenomena. In\nfact all three of these “Three Writings” deal with the\nembodied realization of the Dharma. But they do this from the\ndifferent angles of the microcosm of the human body and the macrocosm\nof the cosmic body.  Embodiment then plays an important role in\nKūkai’s Buddhism. As we shall see below, the embodiment of the\nDharma as such also involves the incorporation of the mantra and the\nmandala along with other esoteric features. The work that represents\nthe culmination of Kūkai’s thought, completed at the age of 57\nin 830, is his Jûjûshinron (10 vols.) along\nwith its abridged version, Hizô hôyaku (3\nvols.). These two works position Shingon esotericism as the\nculmination of all Buddhist and religious standpoints. They make the\ngrand claim that Shingon provides the most comprehensive view to\ntruth, the Dharma. All other religious views on the other hand are\nmere approximations of that truth in various degrees and from various\nperspectives. Each religious standpoint then corresponds to a specific\nlevel of development of the human mind, which in ten states leads up\nto the enlightened mind. The final culminating stage of enlightenment\nthen is what corresponds to Shingon doctrine as the most\ncomprehensive, and hence “most true.” Nevertheless, the\npre-Shingon and exoteric teachings each have their rightful place\nwithin this scheme so that they are not utterly discounted. In\naddition to the above-mentioned six major works, there is also\nKūkai’s first work — written prior to his trip to China\n—, the Sangôshîki. This was his first look at\nBuddhism in comparison with Taoism and Confucianism. In the following\nhowever, I shall focus on Kūkai’s thought in the six major\nworks. These are his mature works, and also universally recognized as\nhis most important theoretical works. \n\nIn Benkenmitsu nikkyôron, Kūkai sets out to\nestablish the basic differences between the brand of Buddhism he was\nintroducing to Japan, which he regarded as “esoteric\nteachings” (mikkyô; “secret\nteaching”) on the one hand, and the forms of Buddhism already\nofficially recognized and practiced in Japan, which he classified as\n“exoteric teachings” (kengyô;\n“revealed teaching,” “public teaching”). This\ndistinction between “esoteric” (mitsu) and\n“exoteric” (ken) Buddhism is not found in his\nIndian predecessors.  But some of his Japanese predecessors had\nalready been using the binary ken-mitsu categories.\nKūkai’s contribution was to interpret them in a new way through\nappropriation of the esoteric texts he had brought back from China.\nIn Kūkai’s thinking, that distinction is crucial. While we shall\ndiscuss some of these ideas in the following sections with greater\ndepth, we may here summarize the general distinctions laid out in\nBenkenmitsu nikkyôron for now as follows: 1) For\nexoteric Buddhism, the “embodiment of truth” (Skrt:\ndharmakâya; Jpn: hosshin) is abstract and\ntranscendent and hence does not preach. But for esoteric Buddhism, the\nphenomenal world from the enlightened perspective — that is, the\nstandpoint of the Buddha — is the preaching activity of\nthe cosmic Buddha Dainichi (Skrt: Mahâvairocana) and\nas that “embodiment of truth.” Hence while\nexoteric teachings may be traced to Śakyamuni, the historical\nBuddha, esoteric teachings come directly from the Buddha Dainichi. 2)\nFor exoteric Buddhism, the absolute truth, i.e., the Dharma,\ntranscends world and language, and thus cannot be explained. But for\nesoteric Buddhism, that Dharma itself is being perpetually expressed\nin and as its embodiment in the phenomenal world, in\nits sounds, movements, and forms, and even in the thoughts of sentient\nbeings. In other words, its embodiment refers not only to the\nmeditation of the Buddha but also to the Buddha’s creative and\ncommunicative activities. 3) Exoteric Buddhism lacks, according to\nKūkai, a practical methodology for experiencing\nesoteric truths. While exoteric Buddhism emphasizes the\nintellectual study and comprehension of the doctrines set forth in the\nsûtras, esoteric Buddhism provides a bodily hermeneutic whereby\nesoteric truths hidden in the sûtras as well as in the world at\nlarge can be experienced. And: 4) For exoteric Buddhism, it takes\nthree infinitely long epochs of repeated rebirths of training in order\nfor one to attain enlightenment (Buddhahood); but esoteric Buddhism\nmakes it possible for anyone, irrespective of karmic dispositions, to\nimmediately become a buddha in one’s present embodied state. \n\nIn order to understand the above-mentioned distinctions made by\nKūkai, we need to comprehend what exactly the Buddha signifies\nfor Kūkai. This is also important as his esoteric view of the\nBuddha underlies all of the major points of his philosophy that we\nshall be discussing further below. \n\nIn traditional Mahâyâna Buddhist theory, the Buddha is\nconceived in terms of three modes or forms of embodiments\n(trikâya): dharmakâya (Jpn:\nhosshin), nirmanakâya, and\nsambhogakâya. While originally the term buddha,\nmeaning “enlightened one,” was reserved for\nŚakyamuni, the historical founder of Buddhism, it eventually came\nto designate the ideal for humanity. This ideal became equated with\nthe “truth” (Skrt: Dharma; Jpn:\nhô), taught by the Buddha, of the nature of being.  To\nbe a “buddha” is then to be enlightened to that truth,\nwhich came to also mean the realization of one’s non-duality with the\nDharma. It is in this significance that one way of understanding the\nBuddha is in terms of the universal “embodiment of the\nDharma” (Skrt: dharmakâya; Jpn:\nhosshin). For traditional Mahâyâna, this\nhosshin is an abstract principle and hence impersonal and\nnon-preaching. However as implied in the foregoing section, for\nKūkai the hosshin is identified with the Buddha\nDainichi. That is, in one aspect the hosshin may be\nunderstood to be a personal being who preaches the Dharma by\nconcretizing it in the cosmos as his own body. (Of course though to\navoid anthropomorphism, the hosshin cannot be reduced to this\naspect.) In the traditional three-body doctrine, however, it is the\nother two forms of embodiment that preach. The Buddha, when regarded\nas embodying the Dharma in an historical earthly being, such as\nŚakyamuni, who preaches the Dharma to humans, is called the\nnirmanakâya (“embodiment of\ntransformation”). And the Buddha as enjoying his fruits of\nenlightenment by residing in a celestial buddha-realm, while unfolding\nfurther truths for advanced bodhisattva beings and acting as a savior\nto the earthly, is called the sambhogakâya\n(“embodiment of bliss”).  An example of would be Amida\nresiding in his “Pure Land.” \n\nWhat distinguishes Kūkai’s understanding of the Buddha is that\nhe takes the notion of the “embodiment of the Dharma”\nliterally and radically. Hosshin in Shingon thought is not an\nabstract truth transcending the mundane world. Rather all\nphenomena and thing-events of this cosmos, in their very transience,\nare each themselves embodiments of truth and the cosmos as a whole\ncomprised of these impermanent and interdependent beings is eternally\nan embodiment of truth, the hosshin. Moreover this concrete\ncosmic identification between Buddha, truth, and the cosmos of\nthing-events, was “personal.” That is, hosshin\nwas equated with the Buddha Dainichi. The cosmos as the\nmanifestation of truth, the Dharma, was itself hence equated with the\nbody of the personal Buddha Dainichi. And in turn, Dainichi with his\ncosmic body is then the embodied personification of the universal\nBuddha-nature inherent in all beings and the Dharma that is manifest\neverywhere. Prior to Hui-kuo, this identification of Dainichi with the\nhosshin in Mantrayâna Buddhism was ambiguous and not\nthorough. In the Dainichi-kyô, a sun metaphor is used to\nname its central Buddha, “Dainichi”\n(Mahâvairocana, transliterated as\nMakabirushana), meaning “Great Sun,” as the being\nwhose light illuminates and enlightens all beings in a way akin to the\nsun’s life-giving light. All other deities are seen as manifestations\nof this light.  Dainichi’s identification with the hosshin\nnevertheless remains ambiguous. While he probably influenced\nKūkai in regards to this equation, Hui-kuo himself however left\nno written explications. Kūkai thus has been regarded as the\nfirst to provide a complete and systematic exposition of the nature of\nthe Buddha Dainichi as the hosshin. The sun metaphor\nof illumination — as the source of both being and of knowledge\n(enlightenment) — befits the universality of the\nhosshin perfectly. The illumination of the “Great\nSun” (Dainichi) becomes accordingly understood to mean the\nomnipresencing of the Dharma throughout the cosmos, an omnipresencing\nin turn equated with the Buddha’s preaching. This “proof”\nthat the hosshin does in fact preach helped Kūkai in\ndistinguishing his esoteric doctrines from those of exoteric\nBuddhism. \n\nThis identification between Dainichi and hosshin held many\nimplications for Kūkai, which became worked out in his various\ndoctrines. For example, the equation of Dainichi’s body-and-mind with\nthe cosmos itself also means the immanent presence of the Buddha\nwithin, and as, the body-and-mind of each and every one of\nus. And so Dainichi’s “enlightened mind”\n(bodhicitta) becomes synonymous with the Mahâyâna\ndoctrine of “original enlightenment” (hongaku)\nwithin all beings. But as the Dharma signifies the interdependent\norigination, hence, emptiness (kû) of all beings, its\nembodiment may be said to be an “empty body.” We will\nexamine these ideas in greater detail later. \n\nKūkai’s Shingon Buddhism postulated four forms of embodiment\nas the hosshin itself. This notion of the four forms\nof the hosshin (shishu hosshin) roughly corresponds\nto, while reworking, the Mahâyâna trikâya\ndoctrine. 1) First there is the hosshin in its absolute\nsense, called jishô hosshin. This is the\nembodiment of the Dharma as Dainichi eternally remaining in the state\nof samadhi but also engaging in a monologue, which reveals\nits “self-nature” and unfolds the Dharma through its\nomni-presencing manifestations in the cosmos. 2) Secondly there is the\njuyû hosshin, which is the hosshin\nenjoying bliss.  But this is characterized in its two aspects: A)\n“the self-oriented embodiment”\n(jijuyûshin) describing the hosshin as\nenjoying its own state of samadhic bliss; and B) “the\nother-oriented embodiment” (tajuyûshin)\ndescribing the hosshin in the form of various celestial\nbuddhas directing the blissful fruits of self-enlightenment for the\nbenefit of others. 3) Thirdly there is the hosshin in its\nhistorical and earthly transformation, called henge\nhosshin as manifest in the enlightened personage of\nŚakyamuni. This historical Buddha guides ordinary, ignorant, and\nirreligious people towards the Dharma, but for this sake must\nimprovise skillful (or: expedient) means (Skrt: upâya;\nJpn: hôben) appropriate to the time, place, and\ncomprehension of a given audience. 4) And fourthly there is the\nhosshin in its universal emanation, called tôru\nhosshin. This is its manifestation in all sorts of bodily forms\nappropriate to the situation in order to expound the Dharma, often\nappearing in the same form as the listener in order to share in his\nsuffering. This conception also became generalized by Kūkai to\ninclude all phenomenal thing-events — together with their\nrespective environments or “realms” — as\n“bodies” filling up the entire cosmos. As such every\nphenomenon plays the role of a “buddha,” teaching some\naspect of the Dharma and expressing the Buddha’s enlightened wisdom\nand compassion, to realize the original enlightenment of\nall. Interestingly this implies that each one of us are\nalready buddhas expounding some aspect of the Dharma to one\nanother, but which we must then become aware of in order to realize\nour own Buddhahood. \n\nIt is interesting to note that the celestial buddhas and the\nhistorical buddha (Śakyamuni) are here included as themselves\nforms of the hosshin, when in the traditional\ntrikâya doctrine of Mahâyâna, they were\ndistinguished from the hosshin, which in turn was seen as\nabstract and impersonal. Furthermore, according to this doctrine of\nthe four forms of the hosshin, it is not only the celestial\nbuddhas in the heavens and the historical buddha on earth who preach,\nbut all four forms. From Kūkai’s esoteric standpoint,\nthe hosshin even in its samadhic self-enjoyment is\npreaching the Dharma in its cosmic monologue — for its very\nembodiment is the cosmos itself so that its samadhic\nexperiencing of the Dharma permeates everywhere and everywhen. Simply\nput, Dainichi as the hosshin and as the\npersonification of the Dharma concretely embodied in the cosmos, is\ndirectly preaching the Dharma to the world via his\nomni-presencing being. And while in the broader sense the\nhosshin is thus preaching via the cosmos, in the\nnarrower sense its preaching is manifest in the teachings of esoteric\nBuddhism itself. On the other hand the doctrines of what Kūkai\nclassified as exoteric are traced to either what the historical\nbuddha, Śakyamuni, preached or what the celestial buddhas are\npreaching in the heavenly dimensions. Insofar as they themselves are\nembodiments of the hosshin, what they preach are indirectly\nteachings of the hosshin. But their teachings are\nprovisional, relative only to the comprehension of their audience and\nthe circumstance of time and place wherein they are\npreached. Kūkai claims, however, that through training in\nShingon esotericism, one can receive the teachings of the\nhosshin directly — that is, receive the\ntimeless and absolute, cosmic and holistic, truth of the Dharma in its\nvery embodiment. This was a radical and heterodox claim at the time\nsince the teaching common to all orthodox Buddhist schools was that\nthe sûtras can all be traced back to the preachings of\nŚakyamuni and this lineage is what legitimated their use of the\nsûtras. But for Kūkai, the historical Buddha was but one\nmanifestation of the cosmic Buddha, Dainichi, who embodies the truth\n(Dharma, hô) it preaches as the hosshin. \n\nIn addition to its four forms of embodiment, Kūkai (in his\nSokushinjôbutsugi chs. 3, 4, 5) systematically\nelucidates three aspects as belonging to the hosshin in its\ncosmic significance: the six universal elements (rokudai) as\ncomprising its own body or somaticity (hontai), the four\nmandalas (shimandara) as constituting its “marks”\nor forms of appearance (yôsô), and the three\nmysteries (sanmitsu) constituting its functions\n(sayô). In all three aspects, there is involved an\ninterrelationship of non-duality between its macro-cosmic significance\nand its micro-cosmic significance, that is, between the\nhosshin qua cosmos as a whole and the practitioner\nas a being forming a part of, and partaking in, the cosmos. The three aspects\ninterpenetrate to make-up the macrocosmos while in their non-duality\nwith cosmic constituents, they become manifest through successful\nShingon practice and in one’s consequent enlightenment. \n\nKūkai’s elucidation of these three aspects provide both a\ntheoretical and a practical grounding for his own conception of\nsokushinjôbutsu or “becoming Buddha in this very\nembodied existence,” by clarifying both its possibility and its\nmethod. Japanese commentators have often classified his thought along\nthe following lines: the theory of the six universal elements as\nproviding a metaphysic, the theory of the four mandalas as providing\nan epistemology, and the theory of the three mysteries as providing a\nmetapraxis. But one must also keep in mind that all three concerns\n— metaphysical, epistemological, and practical — are\nintertwined and inseparable in Kūkai’s thinking.  Furthermore\nall three involve the significance of the body so that even in his\nso-called “epistemology,” embodiment cannot be\nignored. \n\nIn the immediately following subsections I will briefly discuss each\nof these aspects before providing a more detailed exposition of them in\nthe following sections. \n\nHosshin in its somaticity is identified with the cosmos as an\norganic whole wherein thing-events come and go via\ninterdependent origination. The cosmos as such is called\nhokkai (Skrt: dharmadhâtu; world/realm of the\nDharma), and in turn as the hosshin, it is the body\nor soma (tai) of the Buddha Dainichi. (However it\nshould not be understood as substantial in the western\nphilosophical sense because it is “empty” — more on\n“emptiness” below.) Hence Kūkai in\nShôjijissôgi cites lines from the\nAvatamsaka Sûtra that “all\nlands are in the body of the Buddha,” or that “each hair\n[of the Buddha] contains myriad lands as vast as oceans…”\nAnd yet simultaneously the truth, the Dharma, embodied in the entire\ncosmos is manifest within each of its micro-cosmic parts. This view\nthat the whole permeates its parts — reminding us perhaps of the\nmore recent theories of holonics or the holographic model of the\nuniverse — allows Kūkai to show that the hosshin\ndoes indeed preach the Dharma throughout the cosmos in its every\nsingle aspect. \n\nThis great cosmic body of the hosshin embraces all phenomena\nthrough the mutual “non-obstruction” of the six universal\nelements (rokudai muge). (Mutual\n“non-obstruction” or muge here must be understood\nto mean what allows for their interrelations and interpenetrations\nthat constitute things. In being non-substantial, they do not obstruct\neach other. And “universal” or dai here must be\nunderstood in its literal sense as “great,” meaning that\nit does not exclude any phenomena or thing-event in the cosmos at\nall.) As the cosmos, the hosshin is made up of the six\n“great” elements (fire, earth, water, air, space,\nconsciousness) which interrelate to constitute thing-events in their\ninterdependent origination. Their interaction thus constitutes the\nsomaticity of an ever-evolving whole. But as dependent origination\nequals emptiness (Skrt: śûnyatâ; Jpn:\nkû) in Buddhism, this cosmic body is an embodiment of\nthe Dharma qua emptiness. Moreover emptiness also signifies\n“space,” for the same graph (kû) is used\nto mean “emptiness” and “space.” Hence the\ncosmic body in its endless vastness, as space embracing everything,\ncan be seen as providing the space for the emergence of thing-events\nthrough the intermingling of the six elements. Thus Dainichi’s body as\nthe cosmic embodiment of the Dharma pervades all beings to\nmake up, through the six elements, each of their own bodies. And yet\nfrom another perspective, as the cosmic body is a vast emptiness that\nmakes room for the emergence of beings, each of these beings are in\nturn empty. For being and emptiness in the Buddhist understanding are\ntwo intertwining aspects of the same truth. (We shall discuss the more\nprecise sense of “emptiness” in the following sections.)\nSo the hosshin in its somaticity designates the ontological\nground of all beings but also designates their underlying\nde-ontologizing (or: me-ontologizing; or even better: anontological) emptiness, their\nnon-substantiality. \n\nThe hosshin in its cosmic significance appears in the form\nor figure (sô) of a mandara (Skrt:\nmandala). That is, its cosmic body appears in a mandalic pattern,\nas represented in the mandalas used in Shingon ritual.\nCorrespondingly the mind of a sentient being is also supposed to\ntake on the form of a mandala especially as he advances in\npractice to realize non-duality with the mandalic\nhosshin. That is, the mind-and-body experience of each\nsentient being mirrors in its own way the mandalic pattern of the\ncosmos. As one becomes enlightened, one comes to realize this\ninter-mirroring.  In the envisioning of reality as a mandala, the\npractitioner, who on the one hand is aiming for Buddhahood, is at\nthe same time also the Buddha existing in the mandalic reality\nand expressing itself in mandalic form.  Whether seen as the form\nexperienced in the mind or as the form of the cosmos, the mandalic\nfigure is the Buddha’s mode of expressing the Dharma. This mandalic\nappearance of the Buddha is categorized into four types, which we will\ndiscuss in a section below. \n\nThe function of the hosshin is equated with all movements and\nchange that occur in the cosmos. Such cosmic alterations are\ncategorized in three ways in terms of visible form (e.g., loco-motion\nor change of place, and trans-formation or change in shape), the\naudible (sound), and the mental (the thinking process). Visible\nalterations are movements of Dainichi’s body (shin), audible\nalterations are movements of Dainichi’s speech (ku), and\nmental alterations are movements of Dainichi’s thoughts\n(i). Together they are called the “three\nmysteries” (Skrt: tri-guyha; Chn: san-mi; Jpn:\nsanmitsu) making up the functions (yû) of the\nhosshin. Since the body of Dainichi is the cosmos itself,\nthese “three mysteries” of its functions are at work in\nall thing-events and are ultimately non-dualistic with the\ncorresponding movements of ourselves. \n\nKūkai (e.g. in his Sokushinjôbutsugi, ch.3)\ndiscusses Dainichi as a “body of the six great elements”\n(rokudaishin, rokudai-taidai), which are the five\nuniversal material elements (godai) of earth, water, fire,\nwind/air, and space, representing the “known,” plus the\nuniversal mental element (shindai) of consciousness,\nrepresenting the “knower.” Ultimately the five material\nelements make up the body of Dainichi and the sixth element designates\nthe mind of Dainichi. Their dynamic but harmonious interplay\nconstitute the “timeless yoga” or samadhi (Jpn:\njô) of Dainichi’s body-and-mind. But since Dainichi is\nequated with the cosmos, all things comprising the whole world are\ngenerated and perish through the interplay —\n“non-obstruction” and “interfusion” — of\nthese elemental constituents. Kūkai then is definitely not an\nidealist taken in its western philosophical significance, and\nShingon thought in this aspect is distinct from the teachings of the\n“mind-only” (Yuishiki; Skrt:\nVijñapti-mâtratâ) school of Buddhism.  For\nthe mental and the material, for Kūkai, are two non-dualistic\n(interpenetrating and mutually non-obstructing) aspects of the same\nDharma — as depicted in the two mandalic embodiments, which we\nshall discuss below. In other words Kūkai does not reduce\nreality to either mind or matter; his perspective is neither merely\nidealist nor merely materialist. \n\nThe interrelationship amongst the elements signifies their\nnon-substantiality, i.e. the fact that they are not ontologically\nindependent, and in Buddhist parlance this means\n“emptiness” (śûnyatâ,\nkû). Hence all elements and things they constitute,\nincluding the entire cosmos is empty. Dainichi’s body, as the\nhosshin that embodies the Dharma, is an embodiment of\nemptiness, analogically understood as a vast empty space — it is\nin part analogical but also exemplary of emptiness. Rather than\nobstructing the emergence of things, this emptiness permits it through\ntheir interdependent origination, which is the meaning of\nemptiness. Their materiality is then just as real as their emptiness,\nand emptiness and matter are non-dualistic. True to the “middle\nway” of Buddhism, Kūkai treads a path that avoids\nreifying substantialism on the one hand as well as utter nihilism on\nthe other hand. And in the non-dualistic interrelationships between\nbody and mind, matter and emptiness, known and knower, the Dharma\nitself, as the truth of non-duality in interdependent origination\nqua emptiness is revealed in every physical and mental\nprocess of the cosmos as the embodiment of the Dharma. \n\nThe “horizontal” interpenetration between the elements,\ni.e., the interdependence and mutual non-obstruction amongst the\nimmanent phenomena of the cosmos, also translates into the\n“vertical” interpenetration between the whole and its\nparts, that is, between Dainichi as embodied in the cosmos and all\nthing-events within. The implications of such cosmic non-duality\nfor the practitioner is immensely significant. In non-duality\nwith the cosmic Buddha, one’s unenlightened self in both\nmind-and-body is thus an expression of the hosshin, an\nembodiment of the Dharma. That is, as one’s mental states\nexpress the samadhi of Dainichi, so also one’s body\nalong with the bodies of all living and non-living things, in every\nbodily movement, manifests Dainichi’s body and its\nmovements. Dainichi is preaching the Dharma through all phenomena\nof the cosmos. But as we ourselves are the bodies through which\nDainichi preaches, we are enabled to realize the cosmic\nsamadhi that our bodies-and-minds express. This points\nto the non-dualistic significance between the two exemplary concepts of\nShingon Buddhism: hosshin seppô and\nsokushinjôbutsu, both of which we shall examine in detail\nin the following sections. \n\nAs the hosshin, the Buddha Dainichi preaches the Dharma\nvia his omnipresencing, that is, through every sensible media\nof the cosmos. Kūkai called this, hosshin seppô\n(literally: “the dharmakâya’s expounding of the\nDharma”), and used its concept (e.g. in his Benkenmitsu\nnikkyôron) as an important criterion for distinguishing\nesoteric Buddhism from exoteric Buddhism. In his work\nShôjijissôgi, this concept of hosshin\nseppô serves as the starting point. The seppô\n(“preaching,” “expounding”) therein is equated\nwith the phenomena of the cosmos as comprising\nshôjijissô, that is, sound, sign, reality, and their\nmeanings. (We will discuss the linguistic or semiological significance\nof this idea in the following section.) The point is that every thing\nand every event in the universe, as objects of our six senses, are the\nBuddha’s preaching of the Dharma. Each phenomenon manifest serves to\nexplain (setsu) the truth, the Dharma. The hosshin\nin its omnipresencing throughout the cosmos, permeating every aspect\nof it, is perpetually informing all things of the Dharma. This cosmic\nomnipresencing of the Dharma via hosshin seppô entails a\ndynamism of continuous activity that accounts for the movements within\nthe universe — both physical and mental. \n\nSince everything to which Dainichi preaches, is itself his\nmanifestation as an embodied part of the cosmos, the sermon is\nultimately a monologue. The expounding of the Dharma is in one\nsense then really the Buddha’s monologic expression of his own\nself-enjoyment in samadhic bliss. And yet simultaneously\nit expresses Dainichi’s compassion for the unawakened (though\nultimately they are non-dualistic with the Buddha) so that they may\nalso enjoy the fruits of the Dharma. Through the help of\nDainichi’s compassionate con-descension or kaji (more on\nthis in a later section), the practitioner is enabled to inter-resonate\nwith the sermon of the cosmos. \n\nThe idea of hosshin seppô also expresses a\nuniversalization in Shingon of the Mahâyâna Buddhist notion\nof expedient (or: skillful) means. The Shingon doctrine of\nhôben kukyô (“ultimacy of expedient\nmeans”) means that any phenomenon or thing-event of the cosmos\ncan serve as a means to enlightenment, entailing a gradation of\nunderstanding, hinging on how the event speaks to the person relative\nto the time, place, and situational context. This also corresponds to\nthe levels of mental states discussed in Kūkai’s\nJûjûshinron (which we will examine in a further\nsection below). The key to immediate and complete enlightenment\nhowever is to understand the comprehensive (or\nholistic) sense of the truth being spoken by the cosmos as a\nwhole even if through the medium of a particular thing-event. \n\nKūkai’s claim was that only through the Buddhism of esoteric\nteachings can one attain to an experiential recognition of\nhosshin seppô, i.e. that the cosmos itself is describing\nthe immediate enlightened body-and-mind state of the Buddha. By\ncontrast exoteric truths preached by other forms of Buddhism are meant\nfor a specific audience in a specific place and time, and hence are\nconditional, relative, and provisional.  Moreover exoteric truths are\nlimited by human language, which is inadequate to describe the state\nof enlightenment and the absoluteness of the Dharma. The esoteric\ntruth revealed in hosshin seppô on the other hand\nunfolds through a non-human language, that is, a cosmic and esoteric\nlanguage originating in the hosshin itself. This is the\nlanguage of the mantra or in Japanese, shingon, literally\nmeaning “the word of truth,” and from which Kūkai’s\nbrand of Buddhism derives its name. Mantra (shingon) is the\nlanguage of the cosmos involving all mental and physical-sensible\nphenomena.  The esoteric truths expressed in this mantric language of\nthe Buddha/cosmos reveal themselves only in accordance with the\nreader’s capacity to attune himself to, and read, this cosmic\n(con)text of the mantric universe. \n\nThe idea of the mantra, inherited from Indian Mantrayâna,\noccupies a significant position in Kūkai’s philosophy, which he\nelucidates in each of his Sanbu-sho and systematically\nand most comprehensively in his Shôjijissôgi.\nMantras denote the reality of all dharmas\n(shohô) — the elemental constituents of\nreality — as themselves signifying the Dharma preached by the\nhosshin. (In Buddhism, the term dharma\n(hô) has many meanings, among which are the\nsignificances of truth itself and the elemental constituents of\nreality. When speaking of truth in its absolute sense as preached by\nDainichi or as embodied in the dharmakâya\n(hosshin), I have been capitalizing Dharma, and when\nspeaking of the elements that constitute reality, I leave\ndharma uncapitalized.)  It represents the primordial speech\nof the Buddha Dainichi uttering and expositing the Dharma, taken in\nboth its restricted human significance and its broader cosmic\nsignificance. That is, Dainichi’s sermon as a mantra in the broad\nsense means all phenomena in general as vibrations emanating\nfrom Dainichi’s eternal samadhi through the interplay of the\nelements via the three media of body, speech, and\nmind. All objects of the six senses as based upon those three\nmedia of visible and tangible forms, audible sounds, and thoughts,\nembody mantras as syllables uttered by Dainichi. And in its narrower\nsense the mantra takes the abbreviated verbal form of syllables\nwritten in the esoteric sûtras and uttered in esoteric ritual\npractice by the practitioner. That is, the mantras uttered by\npractitioners in ritual practice are to be taken as focused\ncondensations of those cosmic vibrations in a particular sound. They\nare condensed manifestations of the content of Dainichi’s sermon,\nnamely the truth of enlightenment, the Dharma. \n\nIn the broader sense of mantra, the whole cosmos is a language or text\nthat must be “read” if one is to receive its meaning (the\nDharma). Kūkai expresses this in the term\nshôjijissô. Shôji means\n“sound-and-sign.” Shô (or:\nsô), meaning “sound,” is the breath of\nDainichi, the vibrations of the five material elements in their\nmutually non-obstructively colliding interplay that resonate sounds\nthrough the air. In the narrower sense, this would be the mantras\nvoiced in ritual. Ji, meaning “sign,”\n“word,” “letter,” or\n“character/graph,” is sound in its signifying character as\nnaming or meaning something. As letter, it also provides a\nmaterial base whereby the sign’s distinction from other signs becomes\nretained and fixed. For what makes something a sign signifying a\nspecific meaning rather than another is difference\n(shabetsu). Anything that manifests its distinction from\nothers in virtue of its pattern (mon) — the various\ncombinations of shape, color, and movement among visual objects\n— then, for Kūkai, is a sign or letter\n(ji). Marking distinct patterns (mon), such things\nare “characters” (monji;\n“pattern-letter”). In the broadest and cosmic sense then,\nall phenomena of the six senses (i.e., the five physical senses plus\nthe thinking mind) as constituted by the inter-vibrations of the five\nmaterial elements and via their mutual distinctions\n(shabetsu), serve as letters of the cosmic (con)text,\nultimately signifying the Dharma but in its different aspects. In its\nnarrower significance, however, ji would be the written\nSanskrit letters as saturated with that esoteric meaning of the\nDharma. Jissô, meaning “reality,” is that\nwhich is named, intended, meant, as evoked by sho becoming\nji. The ultimate referent or meaning of the world as text is\nthe Dharma in the spontaneous playing of its embodiment, the\nhosshin. In turn the process of articulation of the Dharma by\nthe hosshin generates everything in the cosmos, including the\nmyriad beings, their various realms, and its various forms of\nembodiment such as the celestial buddhas and the historical human\nbuddha. It also generates human languages in general which are thus\nseen as manifestations of this cosmic articulation. The cosmos as such\nis a text articulating the Dharma within the empty space of the vast\nlimitless and formless body of the hosshin. The cosmos as\nmantra is hence hosshin seppô. \n\nFrom the mantric articulation of the Dharma emerge ten realms and\ntheir respective languages (of hell dwellers, hungry ghosts, animals,\nasuras, humans, celestial heaven dwellers, śrâvakas,\npratyeka-buddhas, bodhisattvas, and buddhas).\nEach realm as an articulation of the Dharma, has its own\n“sounds-and-signs,” i.e., its own language, in accordance\nwith a specific perspective corresponding to the degree of\nenlightenment and illusion of its inhabitants. But only the language of\nthe highest, the most comprehensive realm, i.e., the realm of the\nBuddha, is identified with the “true word”\n(shingon, mantra), designating the Dharma as it\nis. The nine other languages are by contrast “illusory\nwords” (môgo). And yet they nevertheless do express\nthe Dharma, each from its own relative and limited perspective.\nIn this restricted sense, they are all mantras as well. For they\ntake part in the cosmic text of the hosshin written in the\nsame inter-referential interrelationships obtaining in all thing-events\nvia the interplay of the same universal elements. The\ndifference is that while the other languages are not conscious of their\nsource, the most comprehensive language, the\n“sounds-and-signs” of the Buddha-realm, entails\nself-awareness of its mysterious origin. \n\nThe text of the Dainichi-kyô itself is taken by\nKūkai to be a condensation in scriptural form of that cosmic\ntext of the mantra, comprising of the most comprehensive language of\nthe Buddha-realm. And that same mantric text is then further condensed\ninto each syllabic-root letter of the Sanskrit alphabet itself, which\nthus serves as a means for meditation. In Kūkai’s scheme (set\nout in his Dainichikyô kaidai), the true\noriginal text of the Dainichi-kyô is the eternal Dharma\nitself as the cosmic (con)text or mantra and cosmic mandala, existing\npermanently and comprising the universe and all phenomena. Within the\nworld, an abridged translation appeared that supposedly consisted of\n20,000 volumes and was circulated in India but became lost. The\nversion Kūkai brought back from China is a much smaller one,\nbut his claim is that every word, character, stroke or dot, within it\nin its mantric nature encompasses countless meanings and\ntruths. Thus while the most abbreviated text is implaced within the\noriginal cosmic text, the entire content of the cosmic text is itself\nencapsulated within the characters of its abridgment representing a\ncondensation. This “inter-textuality” exemplifies the\nHua-yen (Huayan; Jpn: Kegon) sense of interpenetration whereby the\nentire whole is contained within each part, but here this Hua-yen idea\nis translated in mantric terms. This same scheme used in explaining\nthe Dainichi-kyô was used by Kūkai to explain the\nrelationship of the Kongôchôgyô and other\nesoteric texts to the world as well. \n\nWhat exactly is the Dharma, the truth that all languages and all texts\npoint to as their mysterious source? Kūkai explicates its\nsignificance qua emptiness in terms of “primal\nnon-origination” (Skrt: âdyanutpâda; Jpn:\nhonpushô). What Kūkai means by\n“non-origination” is related to his understanding of the\nemptiness of things and the differential referentiality of signs.  By\nincorporating the Mahâyâna thought of emptiness,\nKūkai’s linguistic ontology of the mantra proves to be\nsimultaneously a linguistic “an-ontology” (or:\n“meontology”) of sorts.  Every phenomenon of the cosmos, being empty\nof substantiality, is what it is through its interdependent\norigination (Skrt: pratītya-samutpâda; Jpn:\nengi).  Likewise each signifying letter of the cosmic text is\nwhat it is not because of its own substantial identity but\nrather through its difference from other signifying letters. Its\nidentity is constituted not on the basis of a self-same essence but\nrather in reference to, and difference from, others. Signification\nthen for Kūkai is nothing but differentiation\n(shabetsu), which is another way of speaking of the\nnon-substantiality, i.e., emptiness, of phenomena. Every thing —\nrocks, mountains, ants, etc.  — is what it is in mutual\ndistinction with everything else.  And this differentiation occurs\nvia its implacement into a specific situation or context\nvis-à-vis other things in an endless chain of mutually\nreferring (and differing) correlative thing-events. In reference to\nothers and without substantial self-presence, each thing-event is\nhence empty. In this respect, every thing, as signifying letter, is an\nembodiment of emptiness.  And as such a sign or letter manifesting\nemptiness and differential referentiality, each thing-event is thus a\nmantra, Dainichi’s “seal of wisdom of differentiation”\n(shabetsu chiin). The cosmic text constituted of mutually\ndiffering signs is then the empty place of empty things, and as such,\nthe ultimate scripture of emptiness. The hosshin as the\nembodiment of this truth, the Dharma, is thus itself differentiation,\nemptiness. \n\nThe world emerges in the articulation of the Dharma through such\nmutual differentiations in pattern. From out of the sea of emptiness,\nthrough Dainich’s articulation qua mutual interplay of the\nfive material elements, the cosmos is ordered into distinct and\ndiscrete things and events, and the hosshin transforms itself\ninto a legible — albeit ambiguous — cosmic (con)text. This\nlinguistic cosmogeny is simultaneously ontological and\nme-ontological. For each thing as sign in differential reference to\nthe rest of the cosmic text, mirrors the infinity of all the other\nmutually referring and mutually differing thing-events. In its own\nemptiness, each thing-letter mirrors the emptiness of the cosmos,\ni.e., the Dharma. They are traces of the hosshin’s\nomnipresencing non-substantiality, emptiness as the “primal\nnon-originating” source of these thing-events in their\nbeginningless and endless interrelations.  Kūkai takes this\nlinguistic cosmo-genesis in emptiness via the\nhosshin’s world-play, to be the meaning behind the\n“playful striding of great emptiness,” mentioned in the\nDainichi-kyô (T18:21a) and which he quotes in his\nSokushinjôbutsugi. Furthermore this cosmogeny that is an\narticulation of truth, the writing of the cosmic text, is open-ended\nand on-going, dynamically being continuously reworked.  This accounts\nfor the ambiguity of the cosmic text and every sign within it. \n\nThe ambiguity of the mantric nature of the cosmos and of\nall thing-events is in the fact that they entail simultaneously both\nhope and difficulty for enlightenment. The language of the\nhosshin in the form of thing-events may either guide one to\nenlightenment or deceive one into delusion. For in spite of their\nemptiness, their interdependent origination, thing-events can be easily\nreified in light of human desires. When this happens the cosmic\ntext they constitute is misread under the pretext that the world as\nsuch is nothing but a system of substantial things, and that any\ncorresponding language is nothing but a system of signs representing\nthose substantial things. Through the reification of their being,\ntheir “primal non-originating” emptiness is ignored. \nAnd correspondingly one becomes predisposed to cling to them and hence\nsuffer. But this lack of essential origins in each and every\nphenomenon, the absence of their first cause, simultaneously means that\nwe ourselves, all sentient beings, are endowed with the original\nenlightenment of the hosshin (hongaku hosshin). \nHence there is hope for the realization of this enlightenment\nfor all. \n\nShingon ritual practice attempts to trigger this realization through\nthe mantric pronunciations of the five basic syllables of Sanskrit\n— A,Va, Ra, Ha, Kha\n—, emulating the primordial utterance of Dainichi. This is\nto attune the practitioner to the inter-resonance of the basic elements\nunderlying all phenomena, so that he may hear the “true\nwords” being preached by Dainichi. The mantra’s power\nis in its incomprehensibility to human understanding. Its\nsignificance cannot be explained analytically or understood\nconceptually; it is instead to be experienced in ritual. Through\nritualized experience, these intellectually incomprehensible sounds, in\nthe self-deconstruction of any assumed or projected meaningfulness,\nparadoxically evoke the emptiness they mean and the emptiness of their\nmeaning, the emptiness of all in their mutual non-obstruction and\ninterdependence. Its incomprehension makes explicit the\nmateriality and dynamic process involved behind the emergence of\nsigns. This undermines any linguistic assumption of the\nsubstantiality of things and hence any delusory attachments to\nthem. What is invoked is a paradigm shift from seeing the surface\npattern of things to seeing their underlying emptiness. (Abe 1999,\n297–98)  In addition to mantric intonations, another form of\npractice was a-ji meditation, wherein the written form of the\nSanskrit letter A is treated as an object of meditation. \nThe purpose of such concentrated attention on the material form of a\nsign is to gain some sort of an experiential comprehension of its\nesoteric significance, somewhat similar to that of mantra incantation\nas just discussed. However we must note the special significance\nof the particular letter A, which we shall discuss below. \n\nThe two most important mantric syllables from Sanskrit\n— in the Siddham (Jpn: shittan) script system\npopularized in East Asia — emphasized in Shingon Buddhism, in\nboth sound and graph, are A and Un\n(hûm). The former is the seed-syllable of\nDainichi as explicated in the Dainichi-kyô and the\nlatter is the seed-syllable of the Kongô-satta\n(Vajrasattva, a buddha-being believed to have received instruction\ndirectly from Mahâvairocana) as explicated in the\nKongôchô-gyô, and together seen as\nnon-dualistic in significance. In the following I will discuss the\nsignificance of these seed-syllables. \n\nKūkai in several works (especially in\nShôjijissôgi andUnjigi) explicates the\nsyllabic letter A as signifying the above-mentioned\n“primal non-originating” character of all thing-events, as\nthe “mother” of all syllables, letters, and languages, and\nthe king of all mantras. The sound A is also the primal sound\nmade when the mouth first opens to exhale. And in its written form,\nA constitutes the first stroke of every other\nsyllable. A is the first syllable of the Sanskrit alphabet as\nwell as of the Sanskrit words for “origin”\n(âdi) and “unborn” (anutpâda),\ncombined in the Sanskrit word “primal non-origination”\n(âdyanutpâda). It is also the first letter of the\nroot mantra of Dainichi as depicted in the Taizô Mandara (which\nwe shall discuss below): A Vi Ra Hûm\nKham Hûm (Jpn: A Bira\nUn Ken).  Furthermore in Sanskrit, A is used as a\nnegative prefix.  All of these manifold meanings are combined in\nShingon’s mantric use of A to represent the primal\nvocalization of Dainichi. Its omnipresence in form and sound\nsymbolizes the Buddha-nature of the hosshin pervading\neverywhere, while condensing the significance of that all-prevalence\nwithin its singular form and sound. But its all-pervasiveness also\nmeans the origin of all things in their interdependence, that is,\ntheir interdependent origination, hence emptiness. This emptiness of\nsubstance is denoted by its use as a negative prefix, i.e., the\nabsence of self-presence in infinite referentiality. As stated above,\nA signifies the “primal non-originating”\ncharacter of all being. For in signifying the origin of all in their\non-going dependent origination A is thus the “origin of\nno origin.” What this points to is the endlessness of the chain\nof conditions behind each thing-event, never reaching an ultimate\norigin or first cause. But paradoxically this primal absence of any\ndistinguishing origin, this ubiquitous in-difference of all\ndifferentiation, is itself the ultimate origin of all thing-events in\ntheir mutual differentiations and co-relativity. Or put differently,\nDainichi’s mind (along with his body), making no discrimination\nbetween this and that, is like a great space (“emptiness”;\nkû) from out of which he transforms himself through\nself-differentiation into the myriad thing-events and beings. This\ncauseless cause is symbolized in the last letter in Sanskrit, the\nletter H, the first letter of the mantra\nHûm (Jpn: Un).  Its meaning thus\ncoincides with the “primal non-origination” denoted by the\nfirst letter of the alphabet, A. The syllable A,\ntogether with H then embodies the meanings of emptiness,\ndependent origination, and primal non-origination, all expressing the\nbeginningless and endless dynamic non-substantiality of the entire\ncosmos and all being, the empty space that is the body of the\nhosshin, the Dharma of all dharmas. \n\nIt should be remembered however that while Kūkai thus links the\nhosshin’s preaching to the mantric sound and letter\nof A, this same preaching, symbolized in A, in fact\nencompasses all movements of the cosmos, involving colors, shapes,\nsilence, bodily movements, etc., not just the explicitly vocal.\nDainichi preaches the Dharma via all phenomenal means through\nthe three media, the “three mysteries,” of body, speech,\nand mind, omnipresencing himself through all objects of the six senses\n(the five physical senses plus thought). The entire cosmos is hence\nthe language of the Buddha, inseparable from the Buddha’s body that is\nin fact the embodiment of the Dharma (i.e., hosshin,\ndharmakâya). We now turn to the mandalic aspect of the\nembodiment of the Dharma and of Dainichi’s preaching of the\nDharma. \n\nViewed in light of the concept of hosshin seppô, the\ncosmos is a flowering of the Dharma preached by Dainichi, as it spreads\noutward towards beings receiving it in various degrees in accordance\nwith their level of understanding. The form that this flowering\ntakes is the mandala (Jpn: mandara). The mandala in\nShingon Buddhism is a diagram or picture, usually a painting,\npicturing the doctrines expounded in the two major esoteric scriptures,\nDainichikyô and\nKongôchôgyô. It depicts visually the form\nthat enlightenment takes as it becomes manifest in the universe. \nIn other words, it is taken to be a visual depiction of the\nhosshin itself and the flowering of hosshin\nseppô throughout the cosmos, serving as a map for one’s\njourney to enlightenment. \n                 \nThis use and understanding of the mandala was another distinction of\nShingon Buddhism differentiating it in Kūkai’s mind as esoteric\nfrom exoteric Buddhism.  The mandala proves to be “a metaphor for a\nnew envisioning of reality, self, and world” (Gardiner 2008, 44), a\nvehicle for the transformation of vision, whereby\none envisions the world as a mandala.  Kūkai’s\ncontention was that exoteric teachings move the practitioner towards\nthe central summit of the mandala, step-by-step from its own specific\nvantage point without taking a comprehensive view of the\nwhole. Esoteric teachings on the other hand take the entirety of the\ncosmic mandala into one comprehensive view, allowing for the\npractitioner to leap, as it were, into the center to realize\nnon-duality with the hosshin. \n\nIn the esoteric tradition that Kūkai inherited from Hui-kuo,\nthere are two major mandalas that depict the hosshin in two\ndifferent mandalic forms. Each mandala originally belonged to one of\nthe two esoteric lineages, which became combined in China, and is\nassociated with either of the two sûtras. All Shingon\ndoctrines, traceable to the two sûtras, are supposed to be\npictorially depicted in these two mandalas: the Taizô\n(Skrt: Garbha, “Womb of enlightenment”) and the\nKongôkai (Srkt: Vajradhâtu,\n“Vajra realm,” “Diamond realm” or\n“Realm of the adamantine thunderbolt”) mandalas.  Together\nthey are called ryôbu mandara and represent a\ncomprehensive unity. Each are also associated with one of the two\ndifferent concepts of ri (pattern, order — referring to\nemptiness as the reason discerned in patternment) and chi\n(wisdom, i.e., the wisdom of emptiness). Accordingly the\nhosshin can be understood in its embodied form as\nri-hosshin (or rishin) and as chi-hosshin\n(or chishin), two aspects which are ultimately non-dualistic\n(richi funi). The ri-hosshin is depicted in the\nTaizô mandara that expresses truths expounded in the\nDainichi-kyô. And the chi-hosshin is depicted\nin the Kongôkai mandara that expresses truths expounded in the\nKongôchô-gyô. Both depict Dainichi as the\ncentral deity, with buddhas and bodhisattvas surrounding him in\ngeometric arrangement. \n\nThe Taizô-mandara (full name: Daichitaizôsei\nmandara; Skrt: Garbhakośadhâtu mandala;\n“Great compassion womb repository birth mandala”)\nrepresents the “female principle” and expresses the\nmaterial world in its underlying empatternment of ri, which\nis the Buddha’s view to truth from the summit of enlightenment\ndownward to the mundane world of humans. Ri (Chn:\nli) often translated into English as “principle,”\nin fact has the sense of “pattern,” and in the esoteric\nBuddhist context signifies the pattern found in the interplay of the\nfive material elements that constitute the myriad thing-events and\nphenomena. As the material elements form the objects of cognition, the\nmandala depicting the rishin represents the known. In his\ncommentary on the Dainichi-kyô\n(Dainichi-kyô kaidai), Kūkai equates the\nnature of Dainichi taken as jishô hosshin with this\nrishin. He then in turn identifies the rishin as the\noriginal enlightenment intrinsic to all sentient beings but hidden in\nits unmanifest potentiality as what is to be known.  \n\nAs a descending view from the summit, this Taizô mandala\nrepresents the enlightened universe from the perspective of compassion,\nan expression of the “female” principle. Just as a\nmother enfolds her child in the care of her womb, the Buddha’s\ncompassion nurtures the original enlightenment in all. With the\nlotus as chief symbol, the picture represents the manifestation of\nDainichi through his cosmic activities. Dainichi occupies the\nunmoving center with myriad buddhas, bodhisattvas, and other deities\nlayered around it, while Dainichi simultaneously pervades all up to the\noutermost edges of the diagram. From that center, enlightenment\nradiates outward in a spiral, passing through the various buddhas and\nbodhisattvas, descending through various levels of being and mind,\noutward to the phenomenal world as it becomes more and more concrete,\nreaching the human world and further into the realms of animals,\nhell-beings, and hungry ghosts. Thus a wellspring of activity is\ndepicted to be endlessly flowing out of the center. This activity\nmanifests the welling-up of compassion from the Buddha’s wisdom\nas it moves outwards and downwards. Simultaneously all beings are\ndirected inwards and upwards towards enlightenment depicted in the\nmandalic center. The two movements are non-dualistic. \n\nThe Kongô-kai mandara (Srkt: Vajradhâtu\nmandala; “Vajra-realm\nmandala”) represents the “male priciple” and embodies\nthe vajra-wisdom, a wisdom that is adamantine and imperishable\nand that illuminates and enfolds all beings. This symbolizes the\nsixth element, the mental element of chi (wisdom), referring\nto the mental realm of the knower, the subject of cognitive\nexperience. But it also represents the Buddha’s adamantine\npower of illumination that realizes enlightenment, symbolized by the\nvajra (an adamantine weapon with many points). In this\nrespect the mind it symbolizes is not only the practitioner’s\nmind but also the all-comprehensive mind of Dainichi as indestructible\npotentials of the cosmos, as the Buddha’s “embodiment of\nwisdom” (chishin).  \n\nThis Kongô-kai mandala is a rectangle consisting of a\ncombination of nine smaller mandalas, each an originally independent\nmandala, juxtaposed to depict a double spiraling movement, centrifugal\nand centripetal: on the one hand outward of the Buddha’s enlightenment\ntowards the phenomenal world, and on the other hand inward of beings\non the periphery from the mundane world in spiritual progression\ntowards enlightenment at the center. Of the nine smaller mandalas, the\nmost basic, which are on the lower left corner, are representations of\nthe so-called “four mandalas” (shimandara) that\nKūkai classified as the form of appearance of the\nhosshin. (More on the shimandara in the next\nsection.)  All together the nine depict the unending activity of the\nenlightened mind, moving clockwise from the center, to take on\nincreasingly concrete forms, engaging in skillful means to help the\nunenlightened, while the unenlightened evolve towards the center. From\nthe Buddha’s perspective, the center is moving outwards; and from the\nindividual practitioner’s perspective, the periphery is being drawn\ninwards. Enlightened wisdom cannot remain aloof from the realities of\nunenlightened life. Skillful means thus embodies wisdom in concrete\nphenomenal activity. In this respect, the mandala emphasizes the\nnon-duality between wisdom (hannya) and skillful means. And\nit symbolizes the wisdom that knows truth, the Dharma, in all its\nseparate manifestations. \n\nTogether these two mandalic forms depict the form of the cosmos as a\ndynamic process interrelating and uniting the transcendent and the\nmundane, the enlightened and the ignorant, Buddha and man, macrocosmos\nand microcosmos, matter and mind, pattern and wisdom. They visually\nrepresent two simultaneous overlapping aspects of enlightenment,\nvariously described as emptiness and form, compassion and wisdom,\nobject and subject, the dimension from which the practitioner\nis guided by the Buddha and the dimension towards which the\npractitioner evolves. In Kūkai’s reading, these are inseparable\naspects of the hosshin, depicted in the two mandalas from\ndifferent but non-dualistic perspectives. Enlightenment would be the\nexperiential realization of their non-duality: richi funi. In\nShingon practice, therefore the Taizô mandala (rishin)\nis hung on the east wall of the meditation hall; and the Kongôkai\nmandala (chishin) is hung on the west wall. \n\nIn addition to the two mandalic embodiments of the hosshin,\nKūkai (in Sokushinjôbutsugi, ch.4) classifies\nmandalas in general into four types, depicting the different ways\nwhereby the Dharma is manifest: 1. The “great mandala”\n(Skrt: mahâ-mandala; Jpn: daimandara)\nsymbolizes the cosmic Buddha in its physical extension along with all\nthe stages of being, including the buddhas, bodhisattvas, and deities\nthat are depicted in perfect anthropormophic form surrounding Dainichi\nat the center and painted in different colors to represent different\nmaterial elements. 2. The “samaya mandala” (Skrt:\nsamaya-mandala; Jpn: sanmaya mandara) pictures the\nBuddha-cum-universe through a variety of articles or signs,\nsymbolizing the omnipresencing of Dainichi’s intention (Skrt:\nsamaya; Jpn: sanmaya). They include swords, gems,\nlotus, vajra, etc., as each signifying a specific improvisation of a\nskillful mean to enlighten the unenlightened. This also represents the\nunity-in-diversity of all thing-events as forms of Dainichi’s\nbody. 3. The “Dharma mandala” (Skrt:\nDharma-mandala; Jpn: hô mandara) pictures the\nuniverse as the sphere of Dainichi’s continuous communication of truth\n(Dharma), as depicted in the arrangement of mantric seed\nsyllables. And 4. The “karma mandala” (Skrt:\nkarma-mandala; Jpn: katsuma mandara) was originally\na three-dimensional mandala in sculpted form — including the\nphysical layout of the temple compound at Mt. Kôya — but\nwhich more often became a painted one instead. Showing the activities\n(karma) of buddhas and bodhisattvas implied in the other\nthree, this mandala depicts the fact that every change in any form\nwithin the cosmos is an act of the hosshin and conversely\nthat every act of the hosshin is an occurrence of things and\nevents in the cosmos. The four then depict four different aspects of\ntruth: body (the five material elements), mind (intention, compassion,\nthe sixth element), speech (communication), and action (all\nmovements). Through meditation upon them one comes to view everything\nas a mandala, the cosmos as a mandalic unfolding of the\nDharma. Ultimately the mandala depicts not only the cosmos or the\nDharma as object but also one’s own interior self in meditation as one\ninteriorizes it or as one visualizes it within. \n\nOne of the most distinguishing characteristic of Kūkai’s\nBuddhist thought is his concept of sokushinjôbutsu, the\nattainment of enlightenment in this very embodied existence. This idea\nof sokushinjôbutsu represents the apex of Kūkai’s\nsynthesis of Buddhist theoria and praxis. The\ndoctrine itself is not explicit in the two major esoteric\nsûtras, the Dainichikyô and the\nKongôchôgyô. The idea first appears rather in\nI-hsing’s commentary on the Dainichikyô (Ta-jih\nChing Su; Commentary on the Mahâvairocana\nSûtra). Kūkai was the first however to provide the\nidea with a systematic explication in his\nSokushinjôbutsugi, which has been regarded by\ncommentators as the most important of his philosophical\nexpositions. Kūkai’s appropriation and systematic development\nof the theory takes the form of a unique philosophy of praxis\nthat is simultaneously a philosophy of the body. \n\nThe phrase sokushinjôbutsu means literally,\n“attaining enlightenment in this very body” or\n“becoming buddha in this very body.” “Body”\n(shin) — as Kūkai explains in\nSokushinjôbutsugi, ch. 6 — here is not merely\none’s corporeal body but one’s lived embodied existence of\nbody-and-mind as one whole. In addition “body” here takes\non myriad significances when one views sokushinjôbutsu\nin light of Kūkai’s other concepts such as hosshin\nseppô and sanmitsu. Sokushin (“this\nbody”), for example, can signify the cosmos of the\nhokkai as the macrocosmic body of the hosshin\nwith which one’s own embodiment is non-dualistic. It can mean each of\nthe six universal elements or all of them together that comprise the\ncosmic body and its samadhi. It can also mean the four\nembodiments of the hosshin. It can mean the bodies of all\nliving things other than one’s self. In correspondence with the\n“three mysteries” of body, speech, and mind, or\nmudra, mantra, and mandala, it can mean bodily gestural\nsymbols (in), figures of letters (ji), and\nexpressive demeanor or countenance (gô). All of these\nsenses of “body” are interrelated and inseparable,\nmutually mirroring one another. \n                 \nShingon has inherited much of the metaphysics of Chinese\nMahâyâna thought: e.g., the equation of hosshin and\nhokkai, traceable to Hua-yen Buddhism; and the equation\nof the hosshin with the universal Buddha-nature inherent in\nall beings as their “original enlightenment”, traceable to\nT’ien-t’ai (Tiantai; Jpn: Tendai) Buddhism. Combining\nthese Mahâyâna equations, in Shingon, the embodiment of the\nDharma equals the cosmos as the realm of truth, the Dharma, which in\nturn means the inherent universal original enlightenment (honnu\nhongaku) in all beings. But what distinguishes Kūkai’s\nthought is in his focus upon the body and its concrete practice. The\ncosmos is the “body of truth” and our own bodies take part\nin that cosmic body. It is this bodily aspect, as a universal medium\nor plenum that allows for the concretization of universal\nenlightenment to be realized through ritualized bodily\nexperience. Both Hua-yen and T’ien-t’ai had similar\nnotions of universal original enlightenment although that idea was\nquite new to Japan at the time. But what they lacked was any concrete\nritual means for realizing that enlightenment aside from basic\nmeditation.  Kūkai contended that their teachings were thus\nlacking in the area of practice. His emphasis upon a bodily ritual\npraxis that cohered with scriptural doctrine provided them\nwith soteriological — rather than just magico-secular —\nsignificance.  This helped to bridge the gap between theory and\npractice, doctrine and ritual, that was previously left unexplained by\nthe orthodox Nara schools of Buddhism. As a consequence of his\nexplication of sokushinjôbutsu, Kūkai\nthus provided both a coherent explanation of the\nrelationship between theory and practice, and a concrete\nmethod for realizing through bodily experience those teachings, a\npractical method for realizing what Mahâyâna already taught\nin China as hongaku. \n\nKūkai’s claim was that this esoteric method of\nritual-bodily-meditational practice — involving the three media\n(or “mysteries”) of body, speech, and mind — will\nallow one to realize one’s direct embodied participation in the\nDharmic samadhi of the hosshin, i.e.,\n“enlightenment in this very embodied existence”\n(sokushinjôbutsu). The lack of any systematic esoteric\nritual practice in exoteric Buddhism — from Kūkai’s\nperspective, their rituals were unsystematized, haphazard —,\nfails to lead to immediate enlightenment.  Moreover the orthodox\nteaching of the exoteric schools was that it would take innumerable\nrebirths of training until one could attain Buddhahood. Kūkai\ninstead claimed that esoteric Buddhism, with its rituals and\nmeditational methods, can lead one, regardless of karmic\ndispositions, to instant enlightenment “in this very\nbody.” Through yogic and mantric practices\ninvolving the body, the practitioner was to eliminate all attachments\nto the substantiality of self and of things and to their\ndichotomization — this for the sake of immediately realizing\nnon-duality with the hosshin. In this way the idea of\nsokushinjôbutsu is put forth as a major distinguishing\ncharacteristic of esoteric from exoteric Buddhism, demonstrating the\npossibility of attaining enlightenment in one’s presently\nembodied existence in distinction from the long and gradual process\nover countless aeons of rebirths as taught by the exoteric\nschools. \n\nFor Kūkai this bodily and concrete nature of the realization of\noriginal enlightenment, which he so emphasized, is ultimately\npredicated upon the fact that one’s self and Buddha are non-dualistic,\nthat man in his very embodied existence — that is, in\nbody-and-mind — is already a micro-cosmic mirror of the\nhosshin. We next turn to this aspect of man’s mirroring of\nthe Buddha, which simultaneously is also the Buddha’s salvific helping\nof man. \n\nThe realization of enlightenment cannot be attained on one’s own. For\none is not a substantial, i.e., ontologically independent, being to\nbegin with. As the cosmos itself is a web of interdependently\noriginating thing-events, nothing can stand alone to claim complete\nself-sufficiency. The same interdependency that obtains horizontally\nbetween the constituents of the cosmos also obtains vertically. That\nis, the whole is what it is in virtue of its parts just as the parts\nare what they are in partaking of the whole. The realization of\nenlightenment then as an event, as well as the relative degrees of\nspiritual development, entails a micro-cosmic and macro-cosmic\ncorrelativity. This is expressed in Sokushinjôbutsugi,\nch. 5, in Kūkai’s notion of kaji (Skrt:\nadhisthâna), which has been variously translated as\n“empowerment” or “grace.” In religious (or\ndevotional) terms, this is explained to involve both the\nBuddha’s great compassion and the practitioner’s piety, devotion, or\nfaith, which in their correspondence, act together in the attainment\nof enlightenment.  But one must keep in mind that kaji in\nitself is not necessarilly enlightenment because the empowerment is in\nproportion to the level of spirituality attained by the\npractitioner. Through such mutuality, one’s own effort partakes in the\nomnipresencing of the hosshin, realized in various\ndegrees. This mutuality is expressed in the meanings of the\ntwo characters that make up kaji: Ka, literally\nmeaning “adding” or “increasing,” is explained\nto be the Buddha’s compassion that pours down upon, entering into, the\npractitioner’s mind (shin) like sunrays on water.  And\nji, literally meaning “retaining” or\n“holding,” is explained to refer to the practitioner’s\nmind that keeps a-hold of, absorbs, the compassion just as water\nretains and reflects the sunlight. Ka is the gift\nthat Dainichi gives; and ji is our acknowledgment of\nthat gift by cherishing it.  Practically speaking this\nbecomes expressed in the bodily ritual training that the practitioner\nundergoes as he strives to ascend “upwards,” to meet\nDainichi’s compassionate descent “downwards.” In the\nterminology that becomes later popularized with Pure Land Buddhism,\nthis would signify a mutuality and non-duality between self-power\n(jiriki) and other-power (tariki). The two movements\nare aspects of a single movement of enlightenment. In other words,\none’s own striving is the “grace” of the Buddha\nhelping one towards enlightenment. But this cannot simply be construed\nto mean one’s reliance upon other-power but entails that one must\nappropriate that “grace” in self-power. This mutuality of\nkaji is also expressed in Kūkai’s phrase,\nnyûga ganyû (“[Buddha] entering into me,\nand I entering [into Buddha]”). \n                 \nKaji is realized as one becomes aware of one’s self and\nactivity as the micro-cosmic manifestation of the macro-cosmic\nactivity and mystery of the cosmos itself. One could then also say\nthat kaji expresses the mutuality and coherence or\nco-responding that obtains between the two major concepts\ncharacterizing esoteric Buddhism for Kūkai: hosshin\nseppô and sokushinjôbutsu, as two ways of\nconceiving from different angles the same interrelationality of the\ncosmos in its mantric and mandalic expressions. That is to\nsay, in the mantric and mandalic nature of this\ninterrelationality, the Buddha’s hosshin seppô on the\none hand descends from the summit and spreads-out from the center, and\nthe practitioner’s sokushinjôbutsu on the other hand\nraises him from below and gravitates him to the center. Their\nsimultaneity means their non-duality as different aspects of the same\ndynamism of a cosmic emptiness. To realize this, is to affirm one’s\nown original enlightenment in one’s present body in simultaneous\nreception of Dainichi’s expounding of the Dharma. \n\nThe “true words” (mantra) preached by Dainichi,\nas we have already seen, are equated with the dynamism of the cosmos\nitself, which includes our own mental and bodily experiences. The\nBuddha’s preaching through every phenomenon is classified by\nKūkai in terms of the three forms of bodily, verbal, and mental\nactivities, or the three media of mudra (ingei),\nmantra, and mandala, i.e., Dainichi’s cosmic gestural\nlanguage, phonic language, and imaging language. Dainichi expresses\nthe self-enjoyment of his enlightenment in these three functions of\nbodily gestures (mudras), the intoning of sounds (mantras),\nand visualizing-thinking (mandalas). Since the cosmos is Dainichi’s\nbody-and-mind, his deeds, words, and thoughts (or visualizations) form\nthe configurations, resonances, and patterns of the universe, in these\nthree media of “body, speech, and mind,” called the\n“three mysteries.” All visible and/or tangible forms and\nmovements constitute the Buddha’s body and its movements, all sounds\nare his voice, and the mind’s comprehension of this principle is the\nmanifestation of the Dharma in mandalic form expressing the Buddha’s\nstate-of-mind. That is, all objects of the six senses make up the\nconfigurations, resonances, and patterns of the cosmos, the cosmic\nbody-and-mind of the Buddha Dainichi, communicating the Dharma.  As\nKūkai explains in his Unjigi, the three mysteries are\nin every single phenomenon, passing through all stages of being\nwithout discrimination, including stones, plants, trees, animals,\nhumans, gods, demons, and places. Each of these serves as a\n“linguistic” medium that communicates Dainichi’s sermon in\nhis omnipresencing, a sermon of the Dharma which cannot be expressed\nor described by means of the mundane human languages. \n\nAs these three media are in fact different expressions of the same\nDharma, they are not independent of each other. For example, the\nmantra is an expression of the mandala in sound, and conversely, the\nmandala conveys in pictures what the mantra intones. Together\nthey convey in visual form and in audible sound, the meaning of the\nDharma. Through these three media, sentient beings are thus\naroused from their ignorance to realize their own enlightenment. \n\nImplaced within this vibrating cosmos, we are all then taking part in\nDainichi’s bodily, verbal, and mental activities as “originally\nenlightened,” non-dualistic with the Buddha. On the basis of\nkaji, which we discussed above, the three mysteries of the\nhosshin and the three corresponding forms of activities of\nsentient beings inter-permeate. That is, our own bodily, verbal, and\nmental activities are already expressions of the three mysteries of\nthe hosshin. This inter-permeation is hence “always\nalready,” and yet what is lacking for the most part is our\nawareness of it that would realize it. That is why Kūkai,\nfollowing the Dainichikyô, prescribes the ritual\npractice of bodily acts, verbal acts, and mental acts. Bodily acts\ninvolve mudra-formations — these are complex series of\ngestural movements of the hands and fingers in coordination with\nmantra-chanting and visualizations —, meditative bodily\npostures, and the handling of ritual instruments. Verbal acts involve\nmantra-recitations and other forms of prayer formulas or chants and\nverses (dhâranīs). And mental acts involve\nvisualizing or focussing upon mandalas or the figures of Sanskrit\nmantra letters as well as visualizations (kansô,\nkannen) of deities or buddhas — a realization of self\nand world in the sense of both transformation and\nawakening as their fruit.  Together with ingei\n(mudra) and shingon (mantra), the\npractitioner’s kansô allows the mandalic structure\ninseparable from the insight attained in such practice — an\n“image” that in itself is visually unrepresentable and hence\nirreducible to the visual mandalic icon — to unfold. The three\nacts are performed simultaneously in a practice wherein the\npractitioner utters a mantra, forms mudras, and visualizes\ntheir form and meditates their meaning and lets his mind abide\nin samadhi, all at the same time.  \n\nThe point of Shingon practice is to intentionally accord with, or\ninter-resonate with, Dainichi’s movements, mirroring the macrocosmic\nworld in one’s own microcosm. Thereby original enlightenment is\nrealized in one’s very own embodied dynamism of bodily, verbal, and\nmental acts. Shingon ritual meditative practice, as such, involving\nall three activities is meant to intentionally express the realization\nof one’s participation in the cosmic mantra language of the\nhosshin. This practice then provides the means of penetrating\nDainichi’s cosmic mantric language so that one may directly comprehend\nand experientially verify hosshin seppô. By making use\nof all of the faculties of one’s embodied existence — thinking,\nfeeling, sensing, acting, visualizing, etc. —, one is led\nvia kaji to comprehend the Dharma, not merely conceptually or\nintellectually but through one’s body-and-mind. In non-duality with\nthe Buddha’s cosmic embodiment, one’s own three human activities\n(Srkt: trikarma; Jpn: sangô) — bodily,\nverbal, and mental — immediately become experienced as\nthe Buddha’s own acts, the three cosmic mysteries, as immanent to\none’s self.  Thereby one is now intentionally participating in the\nyoga or samadhi of Dainichi, thus realizing one’s\nown original enlightenment. In this state called “secret”\nor “mysterious samadhi” (himitsu\nsanmaji) or “secret meditation” (himitsu\nzen), with the help of kaji, the integration between\nman’s “three acts” and Buddha’s “three\nmysteries” is realized, and Buddha “enters me and I\nenter” Buddha.  As one’s mind thus becomes enlightened and one’s\nbody becomes “adamantine,” one attains Buddhahood.  (See\nSokushinjôbutsugi, ch.5) In bodily-mental co-respondence\nwith the hosshin’s omnipresencing via the three\nmysteries, Kūkai claims, the non-duality between self and\nBuddha is thus realized immediately in one’s embodied existence, thus\nsokushinjôbutsu. \n\nWith successful completion, this practice of the three mysteries,\nwhich initially has the aspect of “with form”\n(usô) — that is, in rituals —, comes to\noccur naturally, no longer restricted to its ritualized context. That\nis, the individual’s every action in daily life, without ritual form\n(musô), comes to intentionally reflect the enlightened\nbody-and-mind of the Buddha and its three mysteries.  Every word\nuttered is thus a mantra, every bodily movement a mudra, and\nevery thought samadhi. It is in this culmination of bodily\npractice, that all of Kūkai’s major concepts, hosshin\nseppô, hongaku, sanmitsu,\nsokushinjôbutsu, nyûga ganyû,\nconverge in the attainment of Buddhahood. While from the Shingon\nesoteric perspective, this attainment is instant, from another\nperspective, viewed in light of all other (i.e., exoteric) doctrines,\nthe attainment is gradual and relative. We now turn to this final\ntopic in our discussion of Kūkai, the development of the mind\nthrough ten states from the animal to the enlightened. \n\nBy 830 Kūkai has shifted his interest from an earlier focus\nupon the controversy between Madhaymaka and Yogâcâra\nconcerning the emptiness or existence of the dharmas and his critique\nof their view on language as not conveying truth (the Dharma), to\nevaluating Buddhist doctrines as a whole, including the other major\nBuddhist schools.  This shift is most likely connected to the dispute\non-going during that period between the founder of the Tendai school,\nSaichô, and the older Nara Buddhist schools.  In providing a\ncomprehensive scheme that would explain the place of each religious\nteaching as well as the place of esoteric Buddhism in relation to the\nother Buddhist doctrines, Kūkai aimed to demonstrate the\nsignificance of his version of Buddhism. \nIn this scheme, Kūkai is adamant in using the above-discussed concepts to\ndistinguish esoteric from exoteric Buddhism. And yet, given a bird’s\neye view, the truth, the Dharma, in Kūkai’s scheme is\nencompassing enough to include exoteric Buddhism and all other\nteachings as its unfoldings or manifestations, in relative degrees in\naccordance with the appropriate circumstance or context and the level\nof attainment. In order to explain the different levels or states\n(jû, literally “dwellings” or\n“lodgings”) of mind (jûjûshin) that\ncorrespond to the various doctrines of other schools and religious\nsects, Kūkai developed an hierarchical scheme. Shingon Buddhism\nis placed at the top of the hierarchy as providing the most\ncomprehensive view to the Dharma. Kūkai provides this\nsystematization in what many consider to be his magnum opus,\nHimitsu mandara jûjûshinron (Treatise on\nthe Secret Mandala of the Ten States of Mind)\nin ten volumes, composed around 830, five years before his death.  It\nwas written in response to an order of Emperor Junna that each\nBuddhist sect present an introductory treatise of its teachings. When\nthe text proved to be too difficult for the emperor, Kūkai\nproduced an abridged and more accessible treatise on the same theme,\nHizô hôyaku (Precious Key to the Secret\nTreasury) in three volumes. At the core of both works is this\nclassification of the various doctrines whereby each is critically\nevaluated under the light of the culminating and most comprehensive\nview of Shingon.  A similar sort of system of classifying doctrines,\ncalled p’an-chiao (panjiao)\nor chiao-pan (jiaoban) (Jpn:\nkyôsô hanjaku or kyô-han) already\nexisted in China, e.g. within the T’ien-t’ai and the\nHua-yen traditions. Such a system of classification proved helpful in\ntheir attempts to distinguish themselves from, and at the same time,\nincorporate previous doctrines as expedient means that are relatively\ntrue. The Lotus Sûtra had also already expressed the\nsimilar idea that various doctrines were meant as expedient means that\nlead eventually to a fuller truth (expressed within its own text). It\nis Kūkai’s own invention however to associate the different\ndoctrines evaluated and classified with specific states of mind or\nstages of spiritual attainment.  That is, each state in the\ndevelopment of the mind is correlated with a specific set of doctrines\nappropriate to it, as its perspective and lived experience of reality,\ntrue to a certain extent within its limited purview but not yet the\nwhole truth until the final state is reached. In other words, to move\nup this hierarchy of levels of mind, is to experience the unfolding of\nthe Dharma as one becomes further awakened until one fully realizes\none’s enlightenment in non-duality with the Dharma itself, i.e. the\nattainment of Buddha-hood. From a mandalic perspective, this unfolding\nof the Dharma is also indicative of one’s evolution from the periphery\ntowards the center of the mandalic universe. However as each level of\nmind is a “dwelling” or “lodging” place for\nthe mind, the hierarchy from the lowest to the highest\n“stages” is sequential only in the exoteric\ndimension. That is to say that the sequential ordering is not\nnecessary in itself when viewed from the esoteric, i.e., holistic,\nstandpoint. In other words, it is possible to move directly from any\nstate or “dwelling” to the most comprehensive realm. \n                 \nThe teachings evaluated here not only include Buddhist schools but\nalso variations of Brahmanism, Hinduism, and Indian religious\npractices as well as Chinese non-Buddhist doctrines. And the Buddhist\nteachings include the major Indian and Chinese doctrines that have\nmade their way to Japan: Ritsu (Chn. Lu-tsung, Vinaya studies), Kusha\n(based on Abhidharma), Jôjitsu (Skrt. Satyasiddhi, based on\nSautrântika), Hossô (Skrt. Yogâcâra, Chn.\nFa-hsiang), Sanron (Chn. San-lun based on Indian Madhyamaka),\nTendai (Ch. T’ien-t’ai), Kegon (Chn. Hua-yen), and\nShingon. Kūkai’s classification system may be briefly\nsummarized in the following schema: \n\n1st to 3rd states: Pre-Buddhist stages:\nworldly “vehicles” of samsaric entrapment: \n\n1st state: “The mind of the goat foolishly\ntransmigrating in the six destinies (or realms)” (ishô\nteiyô-shin): The state of desire driven by animal instincts\nwithout moral restraint; the stage to which belong common people,\nhell-beings, hungry-ghosts, beasts, asuras\n(“titans”), and various deities or celestial beings trapped\nin their samsaric destinies. \n\n2nd state: “The mind of the child tempered but\nignorantly obsessed with moral precepts” (gudô\njisai-shin): The state of ethical actions and virtue that promote\nsocial order but without any “religious” goal; the stage to\nwhich belong Confucianism and the Buddhist precepts (ritsu)\nfor the laity. \n\n3rd state: “The mind of the child composed and\nfearing nothing” (yodô mui-shin): The state of\ndeity worship and extrinsic magico-religious practice for the sake of\novercoming anxiety with the thought of attaining supernatural powers or\nimmortality, or reaching an eternal and blissful heaven; the stage to\nwhich belong Taoism and various forms of Hinduism or Brahmanism. \n\n4th to 10th states: Buddhist stages (the\nfourth to ninth being exoteric Buddhism and the tenth being esoteric\nBuddhism): \n\n4th to 5th states: Hinâyâna stages:\n“vehicles” of those who aspire towards self-enlightenment\nwithout caring for the enlightenment of others. \n\n4th state: “The mind of one affirming only the\nelements and negating the self” (yuiun muga-shin): The\nstate of the śrâvaka who analyzes phenomena into the\npsycho-physical “aggregates” (skandhas) and/or the\nelements (dharmas), to thus negate any belief in a permanent\nego (atman); the stage to which belong the teachings of the\nhistorical Buddha and his direct disciples and of the\nAbhidharma scholastics. While the substantiality of\nreality is thus deconstructed into its elemental dharmas, the\ndharmas themselves however become fetters, thus taking from\nthree lives to sixty aeons to achieve liberation. \n\n5th state: “The mind freed from karmic seeds”\n(batsu gôinju-shin): The state of the\npratyeka-buddha, who, masterless on his own, attains insight\ninto the chain of dependent origination to recognize the impermanence,\nself-less-ness, and non-substantiality of all, thus preventing new\nkarma to arise. But in enjoying a certain level of\n“enlightenment,” he falls back into the\n“egoism” of self-complacency, compassionless apathy towards\nfellow beings, and the narrow vision of other-worldliness. Hence\nhe has not yet reached complete enlightenment. The\nSautrântika school belongs to this stage. \n\n6th to 9th states: Mahâyâna stages:\n“vehicles” of the bodhisattvas, those who seek\nenlightenment both for self and for others, by overcoming self-other\nduality and recognizing the interdependency between self-enlightenment\nand other-enlightenment and between wisdom and compassion. \n\n6th state: “The mind of the Mahâyâna\nadherent who is concerned with others” (taen\ndaijô-shin): The state of Yogâcâra with its\nVijñapti-mâtratâ (Jpn: yuishiki)\nstandpoint that everything is “mind-only,” reached by its\nanalysis of thing-events as phenomena of consciousness originating from\na deep un-conscious “storehouse” or “receptacle\nconsciousness” (âlaya-vijñâna). \nIts point is to detach oneself from the discriminating objectification\nof phenomena in order to realize the tranquility of\n“mind-only” from a non-discriminating perspective, which\nwould allow the practice of “great compassion.”  And\nyet this still takes several aeons of practice to achieve and is not\nthe final state. \n\n7th state: “The mind of one who realizes\nnon-origination” (kakushin fushô-shin): The state\nof Madhyamaka with its śûnyavâda (Jpn:\nkûgan) standpoint that everything is empty. Here\nreifying and substantializing conceptions — including both\nobjects and mind — that act as fetters are eliminated through\nNâgârjuna’s eight-fold negations which via their\ndependent origination show their emptiness. \n\n8th state: “The mind of one who realizes harmony\nwith the one path of truth” (nyojitsu ichidô-shin\nor ichidô muishin): The state of T’ien-t’ai\nwith its standpoint of “oneness of all,” wherein one\nrealizes that one moment contains eternity, a single thought contains\nall possible worlds, and a sesame seed contains a mountain, i.e. the\nnon-duality between one and many; and between emptiness, dependent\norigination, and their “middle.” \n\n9th state: “The mind of one who realizes the\nabsence of substance within ultimate truth” (goku\nmujishô-shin): The state of Hua-yen with its standpoint of\nthe mutual non-obstruction and interpenetration between the patternment\n(Chn: li; Jpn: ri) of all and the concrete\nthing-events (Chn: shih; Jpn: ji) on the basis of\ntheir emptiness, whereby one and many are non-dualistic. This\nnon-duality is extended to the level of the entire\ndharmadhâtu. \n\n10th state: Both Tendai and Kegon for Kūkai however\nlack the crucial element of direct experiential understanding to truly\nrealize what they preach. One must thus proceed further by means of\nbodily ritual practice provided by the next and final state:\nMantrayâna: “The mind of secret sublimity”\n(himitsu shôgon-shin). This is the state of Shingon,\nwhose esoteric teachings and bodily experiential practice constitute\nthe summit of the development of the mind. At this summit hosshin\nseppô is revealed and one attains\nsokushinjôbutsu through the micro-macro-cosmic\ncorrelativity of the three mysteries and through kaji.  \n\nRather than rejecting or negating the previous states, this final\nstate fulfills and encompasses their standpoints from what is claimed\nto be the most comprehensive standpoint, in view of — or rather\nin non-duality with — the Dharma. In light of the Dharma, the\ntruths taught in those previous states are but relative or provisional\ntruths, expedient means that are helpful only insofar as they lead one\ntowards this final truth but which can also serve as fetters if one\nbecomes attached to them. Each state is referred to as a\n“palace” (kyû or gû), which\nare all combined in the one grand cosmic palace\n(hokkaigû or hokkai shinden). This grand\npalace constitutes the entire cosmos as a mandala, with the tenth and\nhighest state, the innermost secret palace of Dainichi, at the center\nand summit from which the Dharma emanates into its various\nmanifestations in the lower states, the outer palaces. The closer one\nis to the center, the stronger one feels the pull of kaji\ndrawing one up towards the central summit. But as stated above, the\nsequential ordering of the hierarchy is not necessary when the whole\nis viewed from this most comprehensive standpoint. For the grand\ncosmic palace penetrates and comprehends all of the specific palaces\nor dwellings of the mind. Hence one can make a sudden leap from any\npoint in this cosmic mandala towards the center by successfully\nengaging in the esoteric practice of Shingon Buddhism.  It is this\nmandalic structure that the term mandala in the title of the\nlonger version of this work (Treatise on the Secret Mandala of the\nTen States of Mind) signifies.  It refers to the blueprint of the\ncosmic embodiment of the Dharma (hosshin), which in turn\nstructures one’s (ritual) practice in its arrangement and how one\naccordingly experiences the Dharma. \nAmong the better known philosophers of the Kyoto School, references to\nKūkai or Shingon, when compared to Zen or Pure Land Buddhism, are\nhardly noticeable.  It has been suggested that this neglect may have\nsomething to do with an intellectual’s prejudice against the\n“esoteric,” e.g.  the significance of ritual with its\nsymbols and images, which are not so easily amenable to rational\ncomprehension and instead conjure up preconceptions of the\n“occult” and the “magical.” However the\nphilosophical aspects of Shingon Buddhism are often traceable to the\nsame Mahâyâna seeds that sprouted Zen. Once such\nprejudices are overcome, it would not be so difficult for the\ncontemporary philosopher to find in Kūkai a well-spring of ideas\nand thoughts which may be of interest today. \nWe need to acknowledge, however, that Kūkai and Shingon Buddhism\nin general have not altogether been ignored by contemporary\nphilosophers of Japan.  Even within the Kyoto School, its current\nrepresentative Ueda Shizuteru in a 1993 lecture, Basho to\nmandara, discusses the significance of mandalas in Shingon\nBuddhism in relation to the ontological structure of human existence\nunderstood in his terms as being-in-the-twofold-world.  In his\nanalysis of Kūkai’s mandalas, Ueda approriates contemporary\nphilosophical concepts, such as Nishida’s “place”\n(basho), Nishitani’s “field” (ba), and\nHeidegger’s “being-in-the-world”\n(In-der-Welt-sein), and takes the mandala as indicative of\nthe always assumed semantic space (imi kûkan) belonging\nto the world (sekai) as the total framework of meanings\n(imi no waku gumi) wherein we find ourselves.  A couple of\nother graduates of Kyoto University’s philosophy department have\nentire books on Kūkai.  In Kūkai no shisô ni\ntsuite, Umehara Takeshi discusses Kūkai both as a religious\npractitioner and as a theorist, who explicates the world’s infinite\n“treasure” unfolding within the self.  And ex-Nishidian\nturned Marxist, Yanagida Kenjûrô, has a study on\nKūkai and his works: Nihon shingon no tetsugaku: Kūkai\nHizôhôyaku to Ben’kenmitsu nikyôron. \nAmong other twentieth century Japanese philosophers, Yuasa Yasuo,\nknown for his theory of the body, often refers to the doctrines and\npractices of Shingon Buddhism, and has writen entire chapters on\nKūkai in Shintairon: Tôyôteki shinshin ron to\ngendai and The Body: Towards an Eastern Mind-Body\nTheory.  Comparative philosopher of religion, Izutsu Toshihiko,\nas well, in Ishiki to honshitsu and other works, has found\nKūkai’s ideas – especially his cosmological-linguistic\ntheory – inspiring enough to incorporate into his own theory of essence\nas part of his attempt to build a synthetic “Oriental\nphilosophy” (tôyô tetsugaku).  Philosopher\nof Buddhist thought, Tamaki Kôshirô discusses the\nsignificance of Kūkai’s philosophy within the history of Japanese\nBuddhism in his Nihon bukkyô shisô ron.  And\nphilosopher of religion and religious studies scholar Nakazawa\nShin’ichi, like Ueda, focuses on Kūkai’s mandalic philosophy in\nhis book, Seppen kyokusenron.  He reads Kūkai’s works on\nShingon as involving a hydrodynamic mode of thinking that in its\nflexibility deals with the non-Euclidean currents of nature with its\nforces of reality, undulating in ripples and forming vortexes.  He\nviews the Shingon mandala as approximating, with its circles and\nlines, what is expressed in today’s fractal geometry, whereby the\ninfinitesimally microcosmic part endlessly and indefinitely iterates\nthe patterns of the whole of nature in its innumerable vortexes and\ncurves. \nKūkai’s ideas engender an holistic view towards nature and the\ncosmos as encompassing ourselves and in our interrelationships with\nothers. They may be of relevance to the dilemmas we face today in this\nepoch of globalization, religious wars, technological\n“enframing” (to use Heidegger’s terminology), and\nenvironmental hazards. And in terms of scholarship, as can be seen in\nsome of the above-mentioned Japanese scholars’ works on Kûka,\nKūkai offers a wealth of ideas for comparative analyses:\ne.g. with Derrida on the world as text, with Process thought on\n“cosmo-holism,” with Merleau-Ponty or Deleuze on the\nsignificance of the body and bodily spatiality and interrelationality\nvis-à-vis the environment, with Nishida or Hegel on dialectics\nand interrelationality, or with major “mystic” thinkers of\nother religious traditions such as Ibn Arabi of Islam or Meister\nEckhart of Christianity on a dynamic non-duality as opposed to both\nstatic monism and subject-object dualism. Kūkai’s thinking\nprovides a wealth of insights, of much value, to offer to philosophers\nof today.\n\n","contact.mail":"Krummel@hws.edu","contact.domain":"hws.edu"}]
