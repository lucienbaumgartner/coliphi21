The “encyclopedia” is a\ncollection of Epistles, the Arabic title of which is\nRasâ’il Ikhwân al-Safâ’ wa\nKhullân al-Wafâ’ (Epistles of the Pure Brethren\nand the Sincere Friends). It consists of extremely heterogeneous\nmaterials, reworked to represent the whole educational training\nintended for an élite (see later). It is very well\nknown, and a great deal of research into it has been done by Eastern\nand Western scholars, but the variety of topics addressed and the\nquestions raised as to the identity and ideology of its authors remain\nunsolved. In an isolated form, and under a false attribution, some of\nthese treatises came to the Latin Middle Ages through the Spanish\nversion by Maslama al-Majrîtî, which is traditionally\nplaced at the beginnings of the 11th century. This already\ndiscussed chronology (Carusi 2000, 494–500) is recently\nquestioned by several scholars. The development of research in this\ndirection was encouraged by the pioneer study, Fierro 1996, part. 94\nand 106–108; cf. also Hamdani 1978, 350; Hamdani, Soufan 2019,\n11-12 (see infra).\n\nThe authors introduce themselves as a kind of\n“brotherhood” (ma‘âshara) of sages.\nTheir work is addressed to “beginners,” who may thereby\nincrease their knowledge. The literary scholar Abû Hayyân\nal-Tawhîdî (922-32/1023), basing his work on the ideas of\nhis master Abû Sulaymân al-Mantiqî (c. 912/c. 985),\nand the mu‘tazili theologian ‘Abd al-Jabbâr\nal-Hamadânî (c. 936/1025) have identified the names of\nthese authors. They are understood to be the qâdî\nAbu ’l-Hasan ‘Alî b. Hârûn\nal-Zanjânî and his three friends, Abû Sulaymân\nMuhammad b. Ma‘shar al-Bustî, called al-Maqdisî,\nAbû Ahmad al-Nahrajûrî and al-‘Awfî. All\nof these men came from Basra and were linked to the Chancellery\nsecretary Zayd b. Rifâ‘a (cf. Stern, 1946; Stern,\n1964).The text of al-Tawhîdî is accurately examined in\nKraemer 1986, 136, 230 ff. This authorship is now questioned by\nseveral scholars, because the learned who transmitted the Epistles to\nal-Andalus appears to be Maslama al-Qurtubî\nal-Majrîtî, not later than the first half of the\n10th century. \nWith regard to the common denomination of “Ikhwân\nal-Safâ’,” the old hypothesis by I. Goldziher\ndeserves mention: according to which the name could have been borrowed\nfrom the famous collection of fables of indo-persian origin\nKalîla wa Dimna to indicate a group of loyal friends.\nStern (1964, 421), however, considers the name as a way of hinting at\nIsmâ‘îliyya. The most convincing hypothesis\nseems to be that which links the name to the content and goals of the\nencyclopedia – the salvation of soul through attainment of\nknowledge and purification of heart (Diwald 1975,\n16–22). Recently, Poonawala hypothesized\n“Ikhwân al-Safâ’” to be a pseudonym\nhiding the identity of the authors (Poonawala 2015a, 264 and 272). \nAs to the date, in the 19th century F. Dieterici proposed\n961 to 986, basing his estimate on the work of the seventeenth century\nlexicographer Hâjjî Khalîfa and on the presence in\nthe treatises of verses by the famous poet al-Mutanabbî (d.\n965). Massignon (1913) used a verse by the poet Ibn\nal-Rûmî (d. 896) to establish these years as the earliest\npossible date (cf. also Hamdani 1999, 76; Hamdani, Soufan 2019, 12;\n28–29), and took the latest possible date to be the one\nindicated by the definition of sine (al-jayb) given by the\nIkhwân. Such definition is not yet the one provided by\nal-Battânî (d. 929; reference to vol. I, p. 46 of the\nBombay ed., 1887-1889, corresponding to I, 86, 14–15 of the\nBeirut edition referred to in this article). The “expected\nevent” frequently mentioned in the encyclopedia would then be\nthe Fatimid conquest of Egypt, which can be traced back to those\nyears. On the basis of astronomical data, Casanova (1915) moved the\ndates about a century forward, assigning the work to the years\n1047–51. \nUntil some decades ago, the almost universally accepted dating was the\none deduced from the testimonies of al-Tawhîdî and\n‘Abd al-Jabbâr al-Hamadânî (see above, 1.\nAuthorship). Marquet reconfirmed Dieterici's earlier hypothesis,\nplacing the compilation of the work between 961 and 980\n(al-Tawhîdî's testimony is dated 981), but he also brought\nthe date back to 909, depending on the hypothesis of an\nIsmâ‘îlî affiliation of the authors. Two\ntreatises have given rise to the idea of an Ismâ‘îli\ninterpretation: Epistle 48 On the invitation (da‘wa) to\nGod and Epistle 50 On the kinds of administration. The\nencyclopedia would therefore be the oldest exposition of the\nIsmâ‘îli doctrine, and consequently, the\n“expected event” might have been the proclamation of the\nFatimid caliph ‘Abd Allâh al-Mahdî in\nIfriqiyya, which happened in that year (Marquet 1981, 95; Marquet\n1972, 66). Hamdani summarizes various opinions concerning the dates of\nthe encyclopedia, and establishes that it was composed in its whole\nbetween 873 and 909 (Hamdani 1978; Hamdani 1999, 78; Hamdani\n2008; Hamdani, Soufan 2019, 15–16; Poonawala sides with\nHamdani’s chronology in Baffioni, Poonawala 2017,\n307–308). Hamdani also thinks that the Ikhwân awaited the\nadvent of the Fatimids, the Fatimid character of the\nRasâ’il not being in question (Hamdani 1979, 62);\nhe configures a precise role of the imâm in this epistle\n(Hamdani, Soufan 2019, 6). The fourth section, apart from the first\nand the last treatises, is claimed to be the core around which the\nfirst three sections have been composed (Marquet 1998, 5), as well as\nthe culmination of the epistles, which demonstrates the importance of\nthe mystery of prophecy and of imâmate (Marquet 1998, 8–9\nand note 21). Also Madelung recently sided with the hypothesis of\nan Ismâ‘îlism of the Ikhwân\nal-Safâ’. Recalling that the Ismâ‘îlis\nof Mashriq, Iraq and Iran did not recognize the claims of ‘Abd\nAllâh to be the expected imâm, being rather\ncommitted to the Qarmat mission, Madelung hypothesizes that the\nIsmâ‘îlis of Basra recognized as imâm\nthe member of the family who had remained hidden in\nKhurâsân, the same person who would also become the\nfounder of the secret brotherhood of the Ihwân\nal-Ṣafâ’ (Madelung in print; but cf. De Smet 2017,\n152, note 1). Madelung’s claim that the epistles are\n“under the auspices of the hidden seventh imam” is\nrejected by Poonawala, since “Muḥammad b.\nIsmā‘īl’s name is never mentioned in the\nRasā’il” (Baffioni, Poonawala 2017,\n303–305, also on the basis of Hamdani’s opinions). \nA quite different chronology is proposed for astronomical cycles by de\nCallataÿ based on Epistle 36 On cycles and revolutions. He\ndistinguishes three “medium conjunctions” of Saturn and\nJupiter occurring every 240 years and a longer conjunction occurring\napproximately every 960 years. The year 571 (birth of the Prophet\nMuhammad) marks a “longest conjunction” (from Libra to\nScorpio); the first “medium conjunction” in 809 is of no\nimportance to the Ikhwân; the second (from Sagittarius to\nCapricorn) should take place in 1047, and would be the “imminent\nconjunction” described in Epistle 48; the third (from Capricorn\nto Aquarius) is awaited in 1286; and the “longest\nconjunction” (from Aquarius to Libra) will take place in 1524\nand will correspond to the rising of the qâ’im of\nthe Resurrection (de Callataÿ 2005, 55–57; Walker et\nal. 2015, 150–152, 156, 204–206). \nThe authors of the encyclopedia have also been confined to a\nMu‘tazilite approach, or placed in an earlier age, under the\nQarmat influence (Marquet 1977; Qarmats were the opponents of the\nFatimid caliph ‘Abd Allâh al-Mahdî). So did\nMadelung many years ago; but considering his recent opinion, that the\nRasâ’il repudiate the Fatimids’ claim to the\nimâmate on the basis of the fact that a new-born of eight months\ndoes not survive (that meaning that Muhammad ibn\nIsmâ‘îl did not reach the Prophet’s rank; the\nrelevant texts are studied in Baffioni 2016 and 2018), Poonawala\nwonders how he could ascribe the epistles to the Qarâmita, since\nthis is a a repudiation of the Qarâmita’s belief\n(Baffioni, Poonawala 2017, 305–307). \nMore recent studies, on the line of a seminal article by Fierro\n(Fierro Bello 1996; cf. Hamdani, Soufan 2019, 11–12, but also\nCarusi 2000), have identified Maslama b. Qâsim al-Qurtubî,\ncalled al-Majrîtî (d. 964, previously confused with the\nscientist Maslama al-Majrîṭî, d. 1007) as the author\nof the encyclopedia (cf. Hamdani 1999, 75; de Callataÿ 2013,\nKacimi 2014a, b, de Callataÿ, Moureau 2015). However, the one who\nintroduced in Spain the whole work is still to be considered Abu\n’l-Ḥakam al-Kirmânî, d. 1066). Because of this\nnew discovery, the timing of the Rasâ’il has\nbeen anticipated of several decades at least. So, the old attribution\nof al-Tawhîdî and ‘Abd al-Jabbâr was revoked\nin doubt, beginning with de Callataÿ who had previously accepted\nit (de Callataÿ 2014; cf. Hamdani, Soufan 2019, 14–15; a\nreconstruction of the journey, material and intellectual, of Maslama\nal-Qurtubî in al-Andalus is in de Callataÿ, Moureau 2017).\nMaslama al-Qurtubî has been also recognized as the author of\nRutbat al-ḥakîm (‘The level of the\nwise man’) and Ghâyat al-ḥakîm\n(‘The goal of the wise man’, being known in Latin as\nPicatrix), two important works on alchemy and magic\nrespectively that are now both to be reported to the first half of the\n10th century. Scholars have also emphasized the impact of\nthe encyclopedia on these two works, and it has even been hypothesized\nMaslama to be one of the authors of the epistles (Carusi 2000), which\nshould not date later than 950. In the light of this new chronology,\nde Callataÿ 2014 examines the possible influence of the\nIkhwân on Ibn Masarra (d. 931), especially on his cosmology,\nreporting this author to the Andalusi bâṭinî context\nof the first half of the tenth century. If the epistles were\ncirculating in al-Andalus already before 950, and their compilation\nmust have begun some time before in the East, another consequence is\nthat the Ikhwân influenced al-Fârâbî and not\nvice versa, as it was believed so far (Hamdani 2011). According to\nPoonawala, the encyclopedia was composed after al-Kindî (d.\nbetween 864 and 870) but before al-Fârâbî (d. 950;\nPoonawala 2011, Introduction, 59). Among those who sustain the\nattribution of the epistles to Maslama al-Qurtubî is also\nMadelung who, therefore, rejects a too high dating of the epistles.\nThe scholar has speculated that Maslama not only brought the\nencyclopedia to Spain, but also contributed to its composition: there\nwould have been a first version, no longer existing, compiled not long\nbefore 937, the one described by al-Tawhîdî, and\nconsisting of previously existing epistles and of epistles especially\ncomposed for the purpose; the Brotherhood would have been founded a\nfew decades earlier (Madelung 2018, 404). \nIn recent times, al-Tawhîdî’s and ‘Abd\nal-Jabbâr’s attribution has been reconsidered by\nemphasizing the Fatimid militancy of some among the pretended authors\nof the encyclopedia (Reymond 2011, 124–125). Hamdani recalls\nthat, according to al-Tawhîdî, such personages were\nQarmats, so that al-Tawhîdî could accuse of eresy Zayd b.\nRifâ‘a, too (Hamdani, Soufan 2019, 7–8, where the\ntestimony of al-Qiftî is also discussed – that the alleged\nauthors were followers of the imâm ‘Alî).\nHamdani even exploits al-Tawhîdî’s observation that\nthe Rasâ’il were widely read, as further evidence\nthat they would have been written long before (cf. also de Vaulx\nd’Arcy 2019b). Poonawala shares historians’ doubts on\nal-Tawhîdî’s reliability and concludes that his one\n“is certainly a hostile witness” that implies the\nauthors’ affiliation with the Qarâmita of Basra (Baffioni,\nPoonawala 2017, 294). Following Hamdani’s\n“deconstruction”, the witness is considered to be\n“very suspicious”, all the more so if one considers that\nmost medieval authors and modern scholars are used to equate the\nQarâmita with the Ismâ‘îlis (Poonawala in\nBaffioni, Poonawala 2017, 298). Poonawala also emphasizes\nStern’s remark on the qâdî Abu\n’l-Hasan ‘Alî b. Hârûn\nal-Zanjânî – that ‘Abd al-Jabbâr writes\nagainst the Ismâ‘îlis without mentioning the\nBrethren at all (Baffioni, Poonawala 2017, 301–302). \nA new hypothesis on the real author of the\nRasâ’il has been formulated in Guillaume de\nVaulx d’Arcy’s doctoral dissertation. The author tries to\ndemonstrate that Ahmad b. al-Tayyib al-Sarakhsî, a pupil of\nal-Kindî, composed the whole encyclopedia in about 894 in the\nform in which we read it now (de Vaulx d’Arcy 2016, partially\nreelaborated in de Vaulx d’Arcy 2019a [non vidi]). \nBut the questions of the identity and ideology of the Ikhwân\nal-Safâ’ still remain unsolved. In recent times, Kacimi\n2016 has come back to the relationship between the Ikhwân and\nthe Sufi thought. Poonawala refuses them to have been Sufi, though\nsome MSS, included the MS Atif Efendi 1618 (dated 1182, on which the\nnew edition of the Institute of Ismaili Studies is based), bear in the\ntitle the mention of the Sufi school – or doctrines. Mayer\nthinks that to result from a later, Sunni manuscript tradition,\n“in which the acceptance, or at least toleration, of esoteric\nmaterial was made likelier by presenting it as proper to\nṢūfī circles, whose respectability […] had been\nestablished by a figure of the magnitude of Ghazālī.”\n(Traboulsi et al. 2016, 7). \nThe traces of classical thought in the encyclopedia, as well as their\nliterary form, equally give an indication that the work was assembled\nin the course of several decades between the 9th and the\nfirst half of the 10th century, and that it may have\nundergone further elaborations. Such a collective enterprise can be\nconsidered as the result of a “stratified” compilation.\nThe supposed reworking of the whole by members of the Brotherhood\nmight also have shifted some Epistles from their original to their\npresent place. Even the headings of the four sections of the\nencyclopedia are misleading. The way in which the treatises follow one\nanother is often inconsistent. The authors must have planned a special\nuse of the enormous amount of foreign philosophical and scientific\nknowledge that is explained in the treatises and to develop it in\nrelation to the doctrinal conflicts and political changes that were\noccurring in their own times. In this sense the presentation of the\nencyclopedia as a “popular” work (Rudolph, 2004, 39)\nshould be rejected. \nBecause their aim is clearly salvation, it has often been supposed\nthat the Rasâ’il were inspired by the\nShî‘ites, or perhaps even the Ismâ‘îlis,\nboth of whom claim the ideological commitment of the encyclopedia. For\nMarquet (1975, 585) the encyclopedia is the most ancient general\nexposition of the Ismâ‘îli doctrine. In 1150, the\nSunni orthodoxy in the person of the caliph al-Mustanjid judged the\nwork heretical and sent the existing versions to be burnt. Yet in\nspite of this, the encyclopedia survived and was translated into\nPersian and Turkish (Corbin, 1964, 193–194). A harsh judgment on\nthe Ikhwân was delivered by the famous Mamlûk muftî\nand theologian Taqî al-Dîn Ahmad ibn Taymiyya (d. 1328).\nHe considered them as Shî‘i esotericists whose doctrines\ncontradict the religion of Islam. For this reason, he rejected the\nattribution of the Rasâ’il to such an eminent\nreligious scholar as Ja‘far al-Sâdiq (Michot 2008). \nAttempts to define the Ikhwân's ideological commitment have been\nmade, but there has been no consensus on the matter. The\nIkhwân's view of ‘Alî as the Prophet's legitimate\nlegate (walî) persuaded some scholars to link them to\nthe Shî‘a, though scattered references in\nnegative terms to the “hidden” imâm appear\ncontrary to twelver Shî‘ism. Other elements have been\nalleged as proofs of the Ikhwân's Ismâ‘îli\ninspiration, such as the hierarchical structure of universe,\nreferences to septenary cycles, distinction between elect and masses,\nthe use of Ismâ‘îli symbols (e.g., the bee as symbol\nof the imâm, etc.). Already Stanislas Guyard in 1874\npublished a fragment of the Ikhwân reporting it to\nIsmâ‘îlism; and so Paul Casanova in 1898,\ndiscovering a manuscript of Risâla al-Jâmi‘a\n(Daftary 2007, 28 and 235; Hamdani, Soufan 2019,\n10–11). Corbin (1964, 190) openly and radically affirmed\nthat the Ikhwân belonged to Ismâ‘îlism. He\ngave an esoterical interpretation of the religious, philosophical, and\nthe Brotherhood rites described in Epistle 50 On the kinds of\nadministration (Corbin 1950). Hamdani (1996, 146) considers this\ntreatise to be \"the most explicitly Shî‘i or\nIsmâ‘îli\" of the entire encyclopedia. The main lines\nof Corbin's presentation are shared, though in more nuanced terms, by\nMattila 2016. Corbin was followed by Marquet (1968, 1071) who stressed\ntheir attacks on Mu‘tazili and Ash‘arite ideas. Stern\n(1964, 416–417) and Diwald (1975, 26ff.) remarked that the\nEpistles exercised their influence on the Ismâ‘îlis\nonly from the twelfth century. The concepts and historical ideas that\nare at least close to those of the Shî‘a –\nsuch as deprecation of the slaughter of Karbalâ’, the\nallegorical interpretation of the Qur’ân and prophecy, or\nthe aversion to political governments and the hope that they will fall\nwhen the present septenary cycle comes to an end (cf. Baffioni 2019b)\n– show according to Stern (1964, 421) and later Bausani that the\nauthors were representative of an Ismâ‘îli tendency,\nbut not of the official da‘wa (propaganda) (Bausani\n1978, 14–16; Bausani 1977, 323; Bausani 1978-1, 267, note 1).\nConsidering Epistles 50 and 48, Bausani agrees, albeit cautiously, on\nthe hypothesis of an Ismâ‘îlism of the Ikhwân\n(Bausani 1978-1, 270; 278 and note 2), identified in their\n“encyclopedic” approach to knowledge (Bausani 1985, 145;\ncf. also Daftary 1998, 2 and 83). Marquet 1973, on the other hand,\nrecognizes in the encyclopedia (in Epistle 48 in particular, On\nthe invitation (da‘wa) to God) the official\nIsmâ‘îli organization at the time (see also Marquet\n1981, 95; Marquet 1998, 5, 7–8), and remarks that the propaganda\nappeals here to philosophers, mystics, and rulers. According to\nHamdani (1996, 150), the event expected by the Ikhwân is the\nadvent of the Fatimids. Epistle 48, Marquet claims, was written before\n910, and almost entirely preserved in its original form; but even if\nit was composed after the advent of the Fatimids, its meaning would\nnot have been perverted (Marquet 1984, 77–78). Other scholars\nhave remarked that even when discussing number seven, so linked to\nIsmâ‘îliyya, the Ikhwân criticize the\n\"supporters of the seven\" (Hamdani 1979, 68; Netton 1996,\n28–29). Non-Ismâ‘îli ideas can also be found\nin the work, for example the invitation to celibacy proper of Sufism\n(but for contrary views see above). In general, the evidence\nsupporting such theories derives mostly from doctrines or parts of\ndoctrines hinted at in the encyclopedia. In denying the Brethren's\nIsmâ‘îli commitment, for instance, Netton (1996, 28)\nremarks that, if the issue of such an allegiance is widely debated,\nscholars have much less addressed the \"broader topic [...] of whether\nthe Ikhwân al-Safâ’ should even be considered to be\nMuslims.\" The enormous variety of its contents and, often, their\ninconsistency seem to have hindered scholars from reaching unanimous\nconclusions on the authors' religious (or rather ideological)\ncommitment and, consequently, on their goals. The main lines of\nresearch in this field were resumed in Kraemer 1992, 165–178;\ncf. Hamdani 1999, 79 ; Hamdani, Soufan 2019, 10ff.). \nThe encyclopedia consists of 52 treatises divided into four sections\non the introductory (al-riyâdiyya), natural,\npsycho-rational and metaphysical-theological sciences. \nTwo additional Epistles, entitled “Comprehensive Epistle”\n(al-Risâla al-Jâmi‘a) and\n“Supercomprehensive Epistle” (Risâla\nJâmi‘a al-Jâmi‘a) are thought to complete\nthe corpus and explain its esoteric (hidden) meanings. Two\nversions of the Jâmi‘a are extant. One is\ncurrently ascribed to al-Majrîtî, the Spanish scientist\nand astronomer who is alleged to have transmitted the Epistles to\nSpain. Godefroid de Callataÿ (2014, 200) identifies this\npersonage with Maslama al-Qurtubî (see above). The other is\nascribed to Ahmad ibn ‘Abd Allâh ibn Muhammad ibn\nIsmâ‘îl ibn Ja‘far al-Sâdiq, the second\nof the three “veiled” (mastûr)\nimâms who were intermediate between Muhammad ibn\nIsmâ‘îl and ‘Abd Allâh, the founder of\nthe Fatimid dynasty. Recent studies on aspects of this work by\nBaffioni (2011b, 2012). According to De Smet, however, the existence\nof the imâm Ahmad is not grounded on any reliable\nhistorical evidence (De Smet 2017, 154–155). The attribution of\nthe Rasâ’il Ikhwân al-Safâ’ and\nof Risâla al-Jâmi‘a to one of the\n“hidden imâm” would also be a late forgery\ndating not beyond the 13th century (De Smet 2017, 157 and\n160). The Risâla Jâmi‘a\nal-Jâmi‘a is also (Tamir s.d., 18) ascribed to Ahmad,\nwhich strengthens the link of the corpus with the\nIsmâ‘îli tradition. While one cannot deny formal and\nsubstantial relationship between the encyclopedia and the\n“Comprehensive” Epistle, the\n“Supercomprehensive” Epistle is never cited in the\nRasâ’il, and it has been recognized by\nKacimi 2015, 331 as an outcome of the Ismâ‘îlization\nof the Ikhwanian corpus. Hamdani 2008 hypothesizes a more recent\ncompilation for the Risâla al-Jâmi‘a. At\npresent, scholars take the study of the manuscript tradition of this\ntext, including an inquiry into its use and evidence in\nIsmâ‘îli literature, to be an urgent task.  \nEach Epistle starts by stating its particular goal. All of them\ncontain a core of technical teachings and a conclusion regarding the\nhaqîqa, the inner meaning of the contents. The texts\ncontain frequent invocations to the learning “brethren”\n– that is, the elect who are studying the sciences – that\nenhance their didactical and exhortative style; these invocations mean\nthat the students will be awakened “from the sleep of matter and\nthe negligence of ignorance” if they apply themselves\nassiduously to study “with the assistance\n(ta’yyid) of a spirit coming by God.” \nThe Epistles vary in length and their style is plain. There are,\nhowever, numerous ambiguities, due to language and vocabulary, often\nof Persian origin, and to mistakes in the transmission of the text.\nBausani (1978, 11) thinks the authors were of Persian origin (cf. now\nHamdani, Soufan 2019, 5). In general, however, the doctrines are fully\nand clearly exposed, with repetitions where necessary to the didactic\nfunction of the treatises. \nDiwald (1975, 12–15) has even wondered whether there were in\nfact several authors of the encyclopedia because of the use at times\nof the first person singular. The basic question, of course, is\nwhether the authors unify the doctrines of more numerous groups, as\nsuggested by the different contexts and even their\ninconsistencies. \nThe Ikhwanian encyclopedia is typical of the changes in Greek science\nand philosophy during the tenth century as a result of the increasing\nShî‘a influence. In the ninth century and at the\nbeginnings of the tenth century, the prominent philosopher Abû\nYûsuf Ya‘qûb b. Ishâq al-Kindî (d. ca.\n870) had already developed single philosophical doctrines (e.g. in\ncosmology or psychology; an examination of the contents of Epistle 41\nOn definition and descriptions in the light of\nal-Kindî’s treatise with the same title is made by\nPoonawala in Baffioni, Poonawala 2017, 277 ff.). Though elaborating\nthem in an original way, al-Kindî had not tried to combine such\ndoctrines with the basics of Muslim faith. Theological considerations\nremain parallel with philosophical issues. The physician Muhammad ibn\nZakariyyâ’ al-Râzî (d. ca. 925), mainly\ninterested to natural philosophy, had even questioned the legitimacy\nof prophecy. \nAt the time of al-Fârâbî (d. 950), ancient knowledge\nwill be considered as an organic whole – not only a sum of\ntheoretical elaborations, but as a real encyclopedia of sciences. It\nshould provide at every level, from the most elementary to the most\ncomplex, the necessary premises for the acquisition of ultimate\nknowledge – the knowledge of God. Then, authentically Muslim\nthought – religious in the strict sense – begins with the\nsubstitution of the schemes of Greek philosophy for those of the\nSacred Text. This is what I. Netton (1989) defined as “the\nprogressive estrangement from the Qur’anic Creator\nParadigm.” Ancient knowledge is the basis on which the\npatrimony of faith is built: sciences are significant not merely in\nthemselves so much as a partial reflection of the single and unique\ndivine Being. See Heck (2008, 2002) for interesting articles that\nfocus on both the Ikhwân’s and\nal-Fârâbî’s ‘willingness to turn to\nphilosophy to explain religion and trace its boundaries.’ \nThe sense of truly “Muslim” science is largely a product\nof the ideological commitment of the authors. Consequently, scholars\narrived to consider the Ikhwân al-Safâ’ as\nrepresentatives of a \"humanistic approach\" to Islam (e.g., Albert\nReyna 2007). This view, however, is challenged by their attitude, to\nsee the ultimate goal of their gnosiological experience as an attempt\nof separating the soul from the ties of matter and purifying it to\nachieve happiness in the hereafter (see also Reymond 2012, 126;\nRaymond 2014, 150). For them, purification can be reached by following\nprophetic revelation with the help of reason. Certainly, the study of\nancient sciences is not viewed, as by \"orthodox theologians\", as a\nvehicle of heresy and even atheism. Rather, sciences explain the\nunderlying reality of the universe and so allow rational understanding\nof the contents of Revelation and of religious Law. As Reymond (2012,\n143) puts it, the Brethren's intellectual attitude demonstrates \"une\nmentalité en construction,\" announcing \"une avancée\ndans une mentalité forgée par le terminus ad\nquem prévisible d'une autorité du dogme achronique\net indépassable.\" \nThe blending of scientific and religious issues is evident from the\nbeginning in the encyclopedia. Sciences should be the main topic in\nthe first and the second sections and, partially, in the third, and\ntheology in the rest of the corpus. In spite of the fact that\nancient texts are always quoted with great accuracy from a\nphilological point of view, the Ikhwân deeply rework the Greek\nsources in line with their goals that are completely different from\nthose of the ancients. Thus religion should not be underestimated in\norder to attain the best comprehension of its various contents and\nreal aims. \nLet us approach the first feature of the encyclopedia, that is, its\nreworking the of foreign “scientific” contents. Various\ncultural elements come together in the Epistles: Babylonian, Indian\nand Iranian astrology, Indian and Persian narrative, biblical\nquotations and cabbalistic influences, references to the New Testament\nand Christian gnosis. A good survey of these contents can be\nfound in Netton 1991, 53ff., 89ff. More recently, the scholar has\nemphasized as \"Philosophically, the Rasâ’il \n[...] constitute a marvelous epitome of the mixing of Aristotelianism\nand Neoplatonism in the caldron of Islamic intellectual endeavour\"\n(Netton 2009, 109). In spite of the commixtion of Aristotelian and\nNeoplatonic ideas – e.g., for identifying Aristotle's active\ncause with the faculties of the Universal Soul, \"Aristotle's\nterminology is all-pervasive in the\nRasâ’il\" (ibid., 111–112). Most\nattention is paid to the Greeks, from the so-called\n“pre-socratics” to Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus and the\nStoics. The encyclopedia can thus be considered a compendium\nof foreign sciences, deserving attention even by those who are only\ninterested to ascertain the extent of what the Arabs knew of ancient\ndoctrines at that time. \nComparisons between the Ikhwân's quotations and the extant\nArabic versions of classical works often show that they might have\nused the same translations at our disposal now. When such comparisons\nare not possible, the ancient excerpta usually correspond to\nthe extant original texts. We should conclude, then, that in quoting,\nreporting – and, perhaps, translating – ancient sources\nthe Ikhwân display the same philological and philosophical\nexpertise associated with the scholars to whom we owe the flourishing\nof the translation movement in Baghdâd. In some cases, they have\neven preserved the only Arabic fragments of Greek authors known to us,\nas exemplified by the well-known case of the story of Giges from\nPlato's Republic in Epistle 52. (The story of Giges is\nanalyzed in Baffioni 2001, 168–170, 175–178). Platonic\nreferences in the encyclopedia are also scarce. The majority of them\nare found in the fourth section and concern the trial and death of\nSocrates. There is also a hint at the doctrine of reminiscence, that\nis seldom mentioned in Muslim sources (cf. for the Ikhwân\nal-Safâ’ Epistle 42, III, 424, 15). The Ikhwân are\nalso informed about the Platonic view on pleasures and about Plato's\nconception of the soul as consisting of three distinct parts: the\nrational soul, which resides in the head; the irascible soul, which\nresides in the heart and is the seat of courage; and the appetitive\nsoul, the seat of desire, which resides in the abdomen (III, 68,\n4–6). The Platonic references are religiously rather than\nphilosophically oriented. That can perhaps be explained by the\ninfluence of the Hellenistic curricula scientiarum (courses\nof study) designed for philosophers. These began by a reflection on\nthe Stoic bios theoretikòs (the philosophical attitude\ntowards life), continued with Aristotelian works representing the\n“scientific” side of knowledge, and ended with Platonic\nwritings, representing the “theological” knowledge\n(D’Ancona Costa 1996, 30–31). The religious approach to\nancient heritage leads the Ikhwân to consider philosophy as an\n“imitation of God according to human capacity.” This\ndefinition immediately clarifies Hellenism as the authors' first\ntheoretical and historical reference. Their source is here Plato or,\nrather, his Hellenistic reading (Kraus 1986, 99, note 4). \nAlthough the Ikhwân appear widely Aristotelian (for instance,\nfor their presentation of the terrestrial world or the theory of\nknowledge rooted in sensation), the wealth of the available sources\nled the “Pure Brethren” to support their doctrines by a\nvariety of theoretical models, often melted together (which even\naffects the consistence of the Ikhwanian idea of God, Islamic and\nNeoplatonic at the same time, Netton 2009, 108). \nThe first topic addressed in the first section are the so-called\n“quadrivium” (a Latin term meaning “the four\nways”) sciences (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music):\nEpistle 1 deals with arithmetic, Epistle 2 with geometry, Epistle 3\nwith astronomy and Epistle 5 with music. Arithmetic, geometry and\nmusic are later approached together in Epistle 6 On\nproportions. Between these two treatises another one is added,\nEpistle 4 On geography: ‘ilm al-hay’a\n(literally “cosmography”) was evidently considered part of\nastronomy – but Epistles 4 and 5 are copied in an inverted\norder in some MSS. \nReferences for the various sciences are, generally identifiable:\nEuclid, Nicomachus and sometimes even Archimedes for mathematical\ntenets (Epistles 1, 2 and 6); Ptolemy supports astronomy and geography\n(Epistles 3 and 4); the Pythagoreans and again Nicomachus are the\nsources for musical theory (Epistles 5 and 6). The Greeks already saw\narithmetic and geometry as the necessary, though not unique, means of\nattaining philosophical knowledge. \nMuch of this section is devoted to logic, the “instrument”\nof sciences according to Aristotle and a view widely shared by Muslims\n(see Epistles 10–14). These treatises take the place of grammar,\nlogic and rhetoric, that in Middle Ages constituted the\n“trivium” (in Latin: “the three ways”)\nsciences and were the basis of a “liberal arts” education.\nThere is no place for poetry or for rhetorical devices in the\nencyclopedia. Dialectics increases damaging opposition among the\nlearned. Although the Ikhwân appear interested in spoken\nlanguage and even in phonetics, they never approach grammar as a\nscience. Rather, they examine the technique of the\n“universal” form of language – logic. In the\nwell-known 10th century debate on the superiority of\ngrammar or of logic, they might have sided with the Christian logician\nAbû Bishr Mattâ ibn Yûnus more than with the\ngrammarian Abû Sa‘îd al-Sirafî (cf. Heck 2008,\n11 for a new perspective on this issue). “Trivium” was\nconsidered preparatory for the “quadrivium,” which was in\nturn considered preparatory for the study of philosophy and theology.\nThe “trivium” and “quadrivium” sciences are\ndescribed in the encyclopedia in an original way as distinct from that\nof other Muslim writers as well as the Latin west (de Callataÿ\n2005, 61–62). Hellenistic influence is remarkable even when the\nIkhwân rely on Aristotelian logic. The logical treatises include\nparaphrases of Porphiry's Isagoges, which the later Greeks\nconsidered to be the first book of Organon (Rhetoric\nand Poetics were taken to be its last books). It is followed\nby Aristotle's Categories, De interpretatione,\nPrior and Posterior Analytics. \nThis choice of texts shows that the Ikhwân conform to the\n“old” tradition that restricted research to the first\nBooks of the Organon, not to that of their great contemporary\nal-Fârâbî, who expanded it to the whole logical\ncorpus. This might be due to the religious aims of the\nencyclopedia. Religious matters can only be treated by relying on the\nsound (sahîh) method for knowledge, while procedures\naiming at mere persuasion or linked to the attainment of that which is\nuseful (and not true) are not to be employed. Logic is no longer a\nsimple instrument of science as it was for Aristotle, but a true\nscience, perhaps the most important one. The Brethren call it\n“the scale of sciences” through which the wise men are\nable to discern “true from false in speeches, right from wrong\nin opinions, truth from vanity in beliefs and good from evil in\nacts” (cf., e.g., Epistle 7, I, 268, 14–16). \nEpistle 7 On the theoretical arts carefully sketches the\nIkhwân's epistemological vision. A sort of “table”\nof human sciences is given (I, 266, 14–274, 21). There are three\nkinds of sciences in hierarchical progression: the\n“propaedeutical” (or preparatory,\nal-riyâdiyya again; “a designation not absolutely\nunambiguous” according to de Callataÿ in El-Bizri; de\nCallataÿ 2017, 78 ff.), those imposed by religious Law\n(al-shar‘iyya al-wad‘iyya) and the\n“philosophical sciences allowing the full comprehension of\ntruth” (al-falsafiyya al-haqîqiyya, higher than\nthe religious sciences). The sciences listed first in the table are\nlabelled “propaedeutical” just as the\n“trivium” and “quadrivium” sciences of the\nencyclopedia, but here the term is used in a totally different sense.\nIt concerns matters of practical utility, such as reading and writing,\ngrammar and poetry (someway close to the “trivium”\nsciences), but also magic, mechanics, arts, trades, history and so on.\nAlthough the Ikhwân state that the sciences of the third group\n– the “philosophical” in the higher sense of the\nword – are the object of their Epistles, they do not coincide\nexactly with the contents of the encyclopedia, at least, with those of\nthe corpus now available. So, the table can be considered as\nevidence of the fact that the whole encyclopedia has been produced\nduring a very long period of time. On the one hand, it might have been\nretained as a first draft of the future enterprise; on the other, it\nshows the further elaborations of the corpus over the\ncenturies. \nEpistles 7 and 8 explicitly recall the Aristotelian division of the\ntheoretical and practical sciences. Epistle 7 is extensively based on\nAristotle (when the Ikhwân introduce the nine\n“philosophical questions,” they are thinking of the\nAristotelian categories, cf. I, 262, 14–266, 7; Epistle 29, III,\n35, 6–7; Epistle 40, III, 345, 6–346, 6; Epistle 42, III,\n513, 14–16 and 514, 13–516, 5). However, the ultimate goal\nof the scientific investigation is identified with the path towards\nhereafter and even connected to asceticism where scientists and\nprophets follow the same way: Aristotelian science is linked to the\nIsma‘ili teaching (ta‘lîm, cf. I, 274,\n20–275, 4). The “programmatic” aim of Epistle 7\nleads us to consider it as the ideal introduction to the whole\ncorpus. On the other hand, the authors'\nIsmâ‘îli commitment is proven by the fact that in\nthe complementary treatise On the practical arts the ancient\n“banausic” (utilitarian) activities are dealt with which\nwere held in high esteem in Ismâ‘îlism (cf. Lewis\n1943; Marquet 1961; and, more recently, Yasien 2006 and Daftary 2007,\n115). \nAlthough the content of the first section is the most\n“uniform,” inconsistencies are found already in it. This\nis especially clear in Epistle 9, which portrays the “ideal wise\nman” from the standpoint of the encyclopedia, where moral\nedification is never separated from theoretical teaching. The approach\nis more than an echo of the well known Aristotelian division of\nphilosophy: it stems from the view of the Ikhwân that he who\nsearches for true wisdom must be endowed with a true mind as well as a\npure heart. Epistle 9 breaks the series of the scientific treatises.\nVarious moral behaviours are considered, with the support of a long\nseries of anecdotes about prophets and wise men, which\nprovide textual evidence that the Ikhwân may in practice\nhave found asceticism (Sufism?) as another way of attaining or\n“enhancing” purification (cf. Epistles 6, 16 and 24). \nThe composed and eclectic character of the whole is even more evident\nin the three other sections. In the second section, the Epistles\n15–22 follow the Hellenistic arrangement of Aristotle's works on\nphysics. Epistle 15 echoes the themes addressed in the\nPhysics. In Epistle 16, entitled, On the heaven and the\nworld, the Ikhwân are shown to be in line with the Muslim\ntradition which transformed the ancient De caelo into a new\nbook De caelo et mundo. Epistle 17 deals with De\ngeneratione and corruptione. Epistle 18 about meteorological\nphenomena and Epistle 19 about minerals recall the contents of\nMeteorology I-III and IV respectively. Meteor. IV,\nsometimes considered spurious and “the first chemical work in\nancient world” according to scholars, was the basis of the\ntheories of “chemical” or “alchemical”\ntransformations in Islamic sciences and of mineralogy. The Ikhwanian\ntreatise deals with mineralogy, geology and gemmology and in the\ncorrespondence established between the celestial and sub-lunar worlds,\nbetween the stars and minerals, it expresses one of the main tenets of\nalchemy. Further Aristotelian echoes are found in Epistle 24 On\nsense and sensation, to which Epistle 35 On intellect and\nintelligible corresponds in the third section. After topics\nconcerning nature, such as the human body in Epistle 23, conception in\nEpistle 25, and man as microcosm in Epistle 26 [on the relationship\nbetween micro- an macrocosm see Maukola, 2009 and, in quite a new\nperspective, Nokso-Koivisto, 2011) the most important topic for the\nIkhwân, the human spiritual dimension is addressed. It is\ndiscussed in terms of the relationship between soul and body in\nEpistles 27 e 28, life and death in Epistle 29, and pleasures in\nEpistle 30. The Aristotelian theory of the immovable mover, which is\nintroduced in Epistle 37 On love, to explain the movement\nimparted to stars by the heavenly Universal Soul accomplishes its\nreligious meaning. It serves to confirm the love human beings feel for\npermanence and their hatred for death: God is the most beloved as the\neverlasting cause of all beings. \nOn the other hand, natural treatises reflect the availability of the\nrich range of mineralogical, botanical and agricultural works, but\nnone of the works by Aristotle on minerals or plants were known to the\nArabs. The corpus aristotelicum on animals reached\nthem (apart from the De partibus and the De generatione\nanimalium) in an abridged form under the title of Kitâb\nal-hayawân, but Epistle 22 On animals is quite far\nin its content and goals from the Aristotelian corpus. In\nfact, it places the whole matter within the well-known metaphysical\ndispute on the superiority of man on animals (besides some attempts of\nviewing it even in an \"ecological perspective\"; see, more recently,\nDarraz 2012; Raymond 2014, 151). . \nThe authors' view of embryology (Epistle 25) is also a collection from\ndifferent sources. On the one hand, the Ikhwân were not\nphysicians, though they display extensive knowledge of anatomy and\nshare the Aristotelian thesis of the origin of the embryo from the\nsperm and menstrual blood, while they did not accept the ancient\nHippocratic theory as developed by Galen, of a female sperm coexisting\nwith that of the male in the formation of the human being. On the\nother hand, they emphasize an astronomical/astrological approach to\nembryology that was not in Greek sources. It is considered to be a new\nidea introduced by Islamic scientists, from whom it passed into the\nLatin world. Greek sources for Epistle 37 on love also vary. \nThe real deviation from Aristotelianism is Epistle 20 On\nnature. In that it shows how nature as taught by Aristotle was\nreceived and theorized by the authors, this treatise could serve as\nthe perfect introduction to the section on natural sciences. However,\nits main part regards angelology. It also introduces a Neoplatonically\ninspired conception of Nature, suggestive of\nIsmâ‘îli philosophical positions, as Abû\nYa‘qûb al-Sijistânî's representation of Nature\nas “agent power” and “principle of\nmovement”. \nThough the Ikhwân never mention Plotinus explicitly, the third\nsection opens with two treatises that deal with rational beings as\nunderstood by the Pythagoreans (Epistle 32) and the Ikhwân\nal-Safâ’ (Epistle 33). These treatises demonstrate beyond\ndoubt that these authors considered themselves true Muslim\nPythagoreans. Pythagoras is said to be “a monotheist from\nHarrân.” The Pythagorean idea of the one as the\nprinciple of numbers, and not as a number itself explains that God is\nthe origin of beings, and not a being like others. If God is like the\none, the Active Intellect is compared to number 2, the Universal Soul\nto number 3 and Nature (or Matter) to number 4 (cf. e.g. Epistle 40,\nIII, 347, 5). The encyclopedia resumes Pythagorean mathematical and\nmusical theories and adopts a numerological approach on the basis of\nthe Pythagorean tenet that “existing beings correspond to the\nnature of number.” The whole reality is considered under a\nnumerological perspective. Every aspect of nature – and even of\nreligion – follows a numeric pattern. This should demonstrate\nthat the cosmos – also introduced as a\n“macranthropos” (man as the pattern of the external world\nas a whole) in Epistle 34 – is organized according to recurrent\nand well-determined quantitative models, being at the same time\ncompletely dependent on God, the principle of everything just as one\nis the root of each number. According to de Callataÿ,\nAristotelian themes are “reshaped”, for didactic purposes,\nin a Neoplatonic frame (El-Bizri; de Callataÿ 2017, 88), so that\nthose who organized the corpus in its final version “are\ndefinitely to be ranged amongst hard-line Neoplatonists in medieval\nIslam” (El-Bizri; de Callataÿ 2017, 89). \nAmong the other philosophical schools and doctrines quoted in the\nencyclopedia an important role is played by hermetism (the religion of\nthe philosophical elite in Ancient Egypt, founded by Hermes\nTrismegistus), as in Epistle 3 On astronomy and, more\nbroadly, in Epistle 52 (Marquet 1973, 1988). Ancient theories on the\nmovements of the stars will finally evolve in Epistle 36 On cycles\nand revolutions into that which, following Cumont, G. de\nCallataÿ (1996, 36–37) has defined as a “fatalisme\nastral.” \nJust like philosophy, as a way towards salvation, is an imitation of\nGod and implies that the disciple is provided not only of an acute\nmind, but also of a pure heart (through which God will be recognized\nas the sole and the supreme teacher in knowledge and deeds, as the\nHoly Book demonstrates, cf., e.g., Qur., II, 31: ‘And He taught\nAdam the names', mentioned in Epistle 28, III, 18, 14–16 and in\nEpistle 31, III, 112, 19 and 141, 13–14; cf. also Epistle 23,\nII, 381, 17), the Ikhwân consider prophetic message (both\nesoteric and exoteric, hidden and clear) as the second necessary means\nfor human salvation and happiness. This brings us back to the second\naspect of the encyclopedia, its religious commitment. \nWe already saw that the Ikhwân rework the classical heritage in\nreligious terms. They also deal with doctrinal questions linked to\nreligion. Epistle 42 On opinions and religions, the other\n“programmatic” treatise of the encyclopedia that opens the\nfourth section, is a discussion of the basic ideas of the Brotherhood\nsuch as the multifaceted epistemological problems, the origin of the\nworld, morals and theodicy and the imamate as well as the various\ndoctrines critically considered by the Ikhwân, such as\neternalism and dualism. It also develops the apologetic side of\nIkhwanian thought. \nEpistle 40 On causes and effects addresses the\ncrucial problem of the origin of the world. The Ikhwân subvert\nto religious purposes Aristotle’s teleological approach that\n“nature does not make anything in vain.” Understanding\ncreation, one of the basic Muslim tenets, is recognized as the highest\nattainment of knowledge. So, the ancients are defended from the charge\nof eternalism (cf. III, 356, 11–18) and, for the sake of the\nmasses, creation is even explained through the comparison of God with\na confectioner. However the Ikhwân – like the\nIsmâ‘îlis – adopt Neoplatonic views as the\nbest explication of the origin of the world by God. The world, then,\nemanates from God through the hypostases of Intellect and Soul.\nEmanationism is the philosophical expression of creation; it also\nexplains the encyclopaedic structure of the treatises. The various\nlevels of reality down to the three kingdoms of the generated beings\n(animal, vegetable and mineral) originate continuously through\nintermediaries from the One. For this reason, by acquiring all the\nsciences from the lowest to the highest it is possible to attain the\ncommon source of everything, the ‘science of God’ in the\ndouble sense of pertaining to God and concerning God – the\nancient metaphysics (metà ta physikà) no\nlonger indicates what comes “after” physics but what is\n“beyond” it. Thus, rather than a mere foreign source,\nNeoplatonism (merged with Neopythagorism) can be considered as the\nIkhwân’s proper philosophy. Philosophy as imitation of God\ncontinues as the guiding principle of the Ikhwân’s system,\ntogether with equal emphasis on divine revelation. \nFrom Epistle 43 onwards, the Ikhwân build their own system from\na religious point of view, often in the fragmentary style typical of\nMuslim esoteric writings. Epistle 43 considers the way towards God\nthrough purification; then the beliefs of the Ikhwân\nal-Safâ’ and of the so-called “Divines,” the\nheirs of a prophetic tradition whose origin is ascribed to the ancient\nwise men (Epistle 44). Epistle 45 expounds the organization of the\nBrotherhood based on mutual help. Epistle 46 considers the faith, not\nonly of Islam, but also of the former monotheistic religions and of\nthe ancient wise men. Epistle 47 considers prophecy and the imamate.\nEpistle 48 discusses propaganda. Epistle 49 deals with a key theme in\nthe encyclopedia – the existence of disembodied agents in the\nworld, based on the Ikhwân’s idea that the full truth of\nthe Qur’ân, obscured in their time by ignorance and\ndistortions, could only be restored thanks to the study of the\nrational sciences developed by the Greek philosophers. In the\nsurviving manuscript tradition, Epistle 49 appears in two versions, a\nshort and a long one. The short one clearly preserves an older text.\nThe long one contains a detailed elaboration of part of the short one.\nThe short version also consists of two parts; the second is a\ncommentary on the Epistle by an author other than that of the first,\nnamely Maslama al-Qurtubî al-Majrîṭî, during\nhis stay at Basra in 936-7. At the same time, Maslama should have also\ncomposed what de Callataÿ identified as the “short\nversion” of Epistle on Magic, to which Epistle 49 was to\nbe an introduction. In fact, both treatises aim to prove the existence\nof spiritual beings: magic in all its forms consists precisely in the\nacts of such spiritual beings. The long version would have been\ncomposed by Maslama after his return to Cordoba. In the printed\neditions, the final part of the short version is added to the text of\nthe long version, but the addition is not found in any of the MSS\nexamined in the new edition, while it might be found in the MS on\nwhich the first printed edition was based (that of Bombay, 1887-1889);\nbut we do not know if such MS still exists (Madelung et al. 2019,\n1–3). Epistle 49 is a complex exposition of Ikhwanian cosmology,\nremarkably different and richer than that exposed in any other\nepistle. This exposition is merged with the authors’ religious\nvision on the relationship between God and the world (Uy in Madelung\net al. 2019, 8). A new vision of the Ikhwân’s magic as the\n“conceptual and practical pivot” of their\nreligious-political reform based on inclusion and tolerance is in Saif\n2019; a study of the so-called “longer version” of Epistle\n52 in Saif 2020. Epistle 50 discusses the various kinds of\n'administration' (physical, spiritual, personal, familiar, etc.), the\ncore of the Epistle being the religious and philosophical approach to\nGod. In the new edition, the treatise appears purged of all the\npassages that led Corbin to his esoteric interpretation (Baffioni in\nMadelung et al. 2019, 148 ; Baffioni 2019d). Some MSS provide\nadditions and/or versions radically different from those reported in\nthe other consulted manuscripts and in the printed versions available\n(Baffioni in Madelung et al. 2019, Appendices A–D,\n237–364; with regard to additions to other epistles see Baffioni\n2019a, 2019c). Noteworthy is the addition in MS Esad Efendi 3638 that\nexplains the story of Adam meant as the progenitor of huimankind, the\nfirst speaking prophet and the heavenly imâm (ed. and tr.\nby Baffioni in Madelung et al. 2019, 237–277; cf. also Baffioni\n2020b). Apparently, Epistle 51 duly gathers up the threads of the\nwhole (often repeating contexts of previous treatises), but its\nrecent editor has also ascertained the existence of two versions of\nit, maybe even three (Alshaar in Madelung et al. 2019, 381ff.).\nEpistle 52 On magic is the last in\nthe corpus, missing in some editions and considered by\nsome scholars (Bausani 1978, 12 and 279) as spurious, and of little\nvalue, so the Risâla\nal-Jâmi‘a would be the true fifty-second one\n(cf. de Callataÿ 2011, 3). However, de Callataÿ inclines to\nthe view that the ‘short version’ of this treatise,\nnamely, the part approximately corresponding to the first thirty pages\nof the Beirut edition, is genuine (de Callataÿ 2011, 5ff). \nThat a text exists in different versions is not an isolated case. Two\nversions of Epistles 32 have been found by Walker (Walker et al. 2015,\n5, 7–8). Similarly, there are two versions of Epistle 48; one is\nbased on a group of MSS that appear to have been copied from an\nIsmâ‘îli specimen; the other is based on a second\ngroup of MSS, including Atif Efendi 1618. Despite the permanence of\nShî‘ite elements, Hamdani believes that the material in\nthe second version has been rearranged in order to provide a version\nacceptable to Sunni-Sufi readers. Although one must believe to the\nstory handed down by al-Tawhîdî, there must have been an\nearlier shî‘i version of the Rasâ’il\n(Alshaar in Madelung et al. 2019, 383). \nThe existence of different versions of a same epistle raises questions\nabout the history of its transmission and about how such existence\nshould be interpreted. Which version should have priority? Should the\nvarious versions be considered to be different stages or different\naspects of the same authorial project? On what basis should they be\nassessed? The date of a MS, although of considerable importance for\ndetermining its value, cannot be taken as the sole criterion for\ndeciding the authenticity or the greater antiquity of a textual\ntradition, since a late MS may have been copied from a very ancient\none. Also, due to problems related to the transmission of MSS\nthemselves, to their dating, and to the nature of the various\nepistles, it is difficult to decide which versions is older or more\nauthentic (Alshaar in Madelung et al. 2019, 382–383). \nThe corpus addresses other main religious issues in Muslim\nfaith: the unity and uniqueness, and the attributes of God, angels,\nhuman destiny, good and evil, resurrection. Divine will and power are\nalso considered when trying to explain evil in the world, though, of\ncourse, Muslim faith does not allow identifying God as the cause of\nevil (Epistle 19). Ultimately, the Ikhwân attribute it to human\nresponsibility, or, better, to the responsibility of creatures in\ngeneral and they do so in quite a Mu‘tazilite perspective. In\nthe hierarchical disposition of universe there are\n“intermediate” beings to which everything that happens in\nthe world may be related. God, a quite remote “first\nbeloved” is beyond all this, like the kings, whose orders are\nbehind everything built during their reigns. Epistle 39 On the\nkinds of movement considers the movement of the whole cosmos,\nfrom that of the stars down to those (natural and voluntary) of human\nbeings. Its aim is to demonstrate the existence of a God who created\nthe world and who will bring it to an end. In Epistle 27 souls (that\nare self-subsistent according to the ancient doctrine) unite\nthemselves to human bodies in order to ensure human salvation; hence\nwise men and prophets are said to be the “physicians of the\nsouls” (III, 13, 7 ff.). The main religious topic is, however,\nresurrection, thoroughly examined in Epistle 38 where it is also\nconsidered as the supreme science (III, 288, 3–5). The theme was\nalready addressed in Epistle 29 (wisdom is recognizable in death in\nthat it allows the vision of God, hence the highest sorrow is\ndamnation). On the same line, Epistle 30 states that the real\n“Hell” is earth, “Paradise” is heaven.\nHowever, the Ikhwân deem as “providential” the\nignorance of the beauties of the afterlife, which might urge people to\ndesire death before the natural end of life. In doing so, they are far\nfrom the Pythagorean doctrine that considered the soul as a fallen\ndivinity imprisoned within the body as in a “tomb”. \nIn conclusion, whereas in Ihsâ’\nal-‘ulûm (“The Enumeration of the\nSciences”), al-Fârâbî deals with Muslim\nsciences such as theology (kalâm) and law\n(fiqh), the Ikhwân mainly stress religion. In the\nRasâ’il, the usual distinction between\nphilosophy/sciences (the rational or ‘aqliyya\nknowledge) and theology (the received or naqliyya knowledge),\nor between reason and faith is not valid as both are combined. \nOn the formal side, the religious commitment appears in the frequent\nQur’anic quotations in support of ancient doctrines, sometimes\nthrough interpretations that are not in line with the theological\nones. Above all, the Ikhwân appropriate the Muslim ideal of\nattaining happiness in this world and the hereafter and indicate in\nthe treatises how to reach it. In physical terms it is by caring for\nthe body, which when healthy and balanced is the condition of the\npurification of the soul. In metaphysical terms, the purified soul is\nsaid to be capable of knowledge, so of being saved – even\nthough, like the Ismâ‘îlis, the Ikhwân deny\nsalvation as attainable through solely philosophy. \nProphethood is an undeniable part of the theoretical experience\nfeatured by the Ikhwân. Their political vision is linked to this\nand implies that attainment of happiness is considered in political\nterms, too, where it results in examination of what has to be\naccomplished to be worthy of entering the entourage of the\nimâm. In Epistle 40 the science of the esoteric\ninterpretation of the Qur’ân (explaining its hidden\nmeaning) is emphasized as the highest divine gift (in doing this the\nIkhwân give an interpretation of Qur., III, 7 which precedes\nthat, much more well-known, given by Averroes two centuries later, cf.\nIII, 344, 10–345, 5). \nThe second pivot of the Ikhwân's philosophy in addition to\ncreation is their discussion of the imamate. It has its first origin\nin Epistle 31 On the diversity of languages (now considered\nfrom the standpoint mentioned in the title by Albert Reyna 2009). Here\nthe Ikhwân show that religious creeds change as a result of\nlanguage transformations. More particularly, differences and contrasts\nwithin the umma due to changes in the Arabic language are\nlinked to the debate regarding the identity of the Messenger's deputy,\nwhich is the main cause of schism in Islam “until their\ntime,” the Ikhwân say (cf. Epistle 31, III, 153,\n8–10 and 165, 8–12). While everybody agrees on the tasks\nof the imâm, there is a disagreement as to his\nidentity. This is because imamate is of two kinds: prophetic and\nregal. Usually the tasks of the ruler are neatly distinguished from\nthose of the prophet, because governance is a mundane business and\nprophecy is related to the life to come (III, 497, 5–6). On\noccasion these qualities are combined in a single person, who is then\nthe delegated prophet and also the ruler (III, 495, 18–19).\nWhile the Prophet Muhammad was both prophet and ruler of the Muslim\numma, so ensuring its best defence, his possible successors\ndid not always match him in nobility. Subsequently, prophecy and\ngovernance are sometimes found in two different persons, one of whom\nis the prophet delegated to that community and the other the person\nwho has been given power over them. They support one another (III,\n495, 19–21). The real problem seems, then, to be the dignity of\nthe person appointed as the caliph, which alone is the condition of a\nlegitimate prophetical succession. The Ikhwân's specific idea on\nthe identity of such a person is not clear. In addition, there is\napparently no distinction between the prophet, the imâm\nor the ruler with regard to the required qualities, as Epistle 47\nOn the essence of divine Law demonstrates. The sole\n“doctrinal” solution offered in the encyclopedia seems\nthat a ruler with ascetic tendencies can legitimately take the place\nof the imâm. \nThe political ideas of the Ikhwân al-Safâ’ have not\nbeen extensively analyzed by scholars, except when they have been\nconsidered as a political movement. (The Ikhwân's interest in\npolitical issues is mainly emphasized by Eastern scholars who in\ngeneral incline towards the hypothesis of their being\n[“filo]-Isma‘ili.” Cf. Hijab, 1982; Tamir,\n1983, 89–108). In fact, the “Pure Brethren” are\ncontrasted with the “philosophers,” who were understood to\nhave taken an outsider position with regard to the political\nexpectations of the society in which they lived, as a consequence of\ntheir evaluation of Plato's Republic (cf. e.g. Kraemer 1987\nand Stroumsa 2003). However, the Ikhwân do not fail to approach\npolicy from a theoretical standpoint and the philosophical doctrines\ndeveloped in their Epistles can be understood to be a functional\nelement of their political vision. In Epistle 48 On the invitation\nto God, a madîna fâdila (perfect city) is\nfeatured – less known but no less worthy than that proposed by\nal-Fârâbî. This time the Ikhwân do not hide\nthemselves behind the ancient Platonic heritage: they openly adapt a\nGreek idea to a Muslim situation, and various aspects of the\n'Ismailism' of the treatise have been highlighted in Baffioni,\n2014a. \nWere the Ikhwân Ismâ‘îlis? This of course\nopens the way to the second side of the argument – the\nIsmâ‘îli commitment of the Ikhwân. \nThe saying “dîn and mulk are\ntwins” in reference to the prophet and the king empowered to\nperform the functions of the imâm in the sense preached\nby the Ikhwân perfectly fits the Fatimid rulers. If this\nhypothesis is tenable, the debated “traditions” mentioned\nin Epistle 31 with reference to the misunderstandings due to the\ndiversity of languages might be understood as the Fatimid versions of\nthe divine Law. If the Ikhwanian “Lawgiver” is identified\nwith the historical incarnation of the Isma‘ili faith, that is,\nwith the Fatimid caliph, and if the “perfect city” is the\none ruled by these caliphs, then the Ikhwân al-Safâ’\nare his du‘â’. Epistle 48, with the mention\nof the term da‘wa in the title, might further support\nthe hypothesis of a project of concrete militancy by the\nIkhwân. \nThe Ikhwân appear as the learned people who have the task of\npromoting propaganda (da‘wa). Sometimes they even seem\nto appropriate the qualities of the king-imâm; in\nEpistle 47 they introduce themselves as the best guides for the\ndefence of Islam in terms of al-hukamâ’ wa\nal-falâsifa wa al-fudalâ’ (“wise men,\nphilosophers and excellent people”) and of the\nanbiyâ’, khulafâ’\nal-anbiyâ’ wa al-a’imma\nal-mahdiyûn (“prophets, successors of the prophets\nand well-guided imams,” IV, 126, 5-17). That the\nIkhwân aim to be the guides of the elect community is further\nconfirmed by a passage in Epistle 9. The ascetics are described as\nthose “who know the shortcomings [of the world], who crave for\nthe hereafter and are convinced of it, firmly rooted in its science,\nthat is the sincere Friends of God, [His] faithful servants, the cream\nof all [His] creatures, whom the Creator – may [He] be exalted\n– called ‘persons of understanding, persons of view,\npersons of mind’” (I, 357, 5–9). These qualities\ncorrespond to those of the Ikhwân engaged, as the leaders of\ntheir community, in their philosophy of salvation; but they also fit\nthe prophets and the imâms perfectly. From\nthis point of view the reading of the Holy Book our authors have in\nmind – rather than a Shî‘i or Isma‘ili\nperspective – might be the ta’wîl performed\nin their own encyclopedia, where God's Word is continually quoted and\ncommented (Baffioni 2012b; Gobillot 2013). And they refer to the\nspiritual city as “our spiritual city,” which coincides\nwith Paradise. \nIn Epistle 47 the legacy of the Prophet is said to be inherited by\n“the most intelligent” (al-‘uqalâ’\nal-akhyâr) which emphasizes the epistemological function of\nthe Shî‘ite caliph. In this case a temporal ruler, the\n“ruler imâm,” is no longer necessary\nbecause the rational Law is the real guide, “incarnated”\nin the “rightly guided” imâm and in his\nreason and knowledge. In contrast to Baffioni 2006, 149–150,\nHeck (2008, 205–209) seems to side with Netton's reading of the\nintellect-guide in terms of a rational intellect. \nFurther elements allow a better defining of the Ikhwân's\npolitical position. The history of early Islam is approached from a\nShî‘i perspective; some important events of the prophet\nMuhammad's life and mission are recalled; soon attention shifts to two\nfatal events which led to the defeat of Shî‘ism, the\nbattle of Siffîn and the slaughter of Karbalâ’. In a\npassage on the struggles for imâmate, the “representatives\nof the Muhammadic (Muhammadiyya) Law and of the Hashimi\nfederation” (cf. Epistle 31, III, 165, 11–12) are opposed.\nIf the latter are the ‘Abbasids (or even the supporters of\nAbû Hâshim, son of Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya), the former\nshould be understood as the direct descendants of the Prophet through\nFâtima, whence the Ikhwân's strict ‘Alid militancy\nshould be demonstrated. \nAnother passage from Epistle 31 (III, 153, 11–156, 9) might urge\nto suppose that the authors' target was the caliph\nal-Ma’mûn, in spite of his pro-‘Alid policy (and\npolitical support of Mu‘tazilism). The Ikhwân report on a\nruler, who encouraged politico-religious controversies among the\n‘ulamâ’ (learned) of different persuasions,\nclaiming for himself the right to interpret the Law on the basis of\nthe Mu‘tazili doctrine of the created Qur’ân.\nJuxtaposed to him is ahl bayt al-nubuwwa (the immediate\nfamily of the Prophet: Muhammad, his daughter Fâtima, his cousin\nand son-in-law ‘Alî and their sons, al-Hasan and\nal-Husayn) as the guarantors of the true tradition concerning\nprophetic succession. The Ikhwân could then still be identified\nwith the supporters of the strict ‘Alid conception of the\nimamate, according to which the science of caliphate belongs to the\nfamily of the Prophet only. \nIf this hypothesis is tenable, Epistle 31 contains not only the core\nof the Ikhwân's political thought, but also of their\nIsmâ‘îli commitment. Their presentation of the\n“perfect city,” in which mutual love is the basis and the\ngoal of the community, does not help us to ascertain whether the\nIkhwân have in mind spiritual rule or a true government such as\nthat of the Fatimid caliph, of whom they might be the\ndu‘â’. Scholars tend to consider this\n“perfect city” as utopian as the Farabian (cf. e.g.\nMarquet 1973, 153; Hamdani 1999, 81). The defeat of evil people is\nalso often foreshadowed in the encyclopedia (cf. e.g. Epistle 31, III,\n154, 19–24 and 156, 2–3). In Epistle 4 the Ikhwân\npresent a cyclical conception of ruling dynasties, and state that\n“the dynasty of the evil reached its apex,” hence only\ndecline and diminution are to be expected in the future. According to\nTibawi (1955, 37, note 4), the Ikhwân forebode here the fall of\nthe ‘Abbasids. Cf. also Tibawi, 1978, 60.) The dynasty of the\ngood begins when the learned agree “on a unique doctrinal school\nand a single religion,” commit themselves to mutual help, and\ndesire the vision of God and doing God's will as their [sole] reward\n(I, 181, 14–182, 2). In Epistle 48, the Ikhwân\ndeclare that the one whose advent in the world is expected is coming,\nand it will be a wonderful event (IV, 190, 13), in which the welfare\nof both religion and the world will be gathered. Magic, astronomy and\ntrue dreams helped them establish even the year and month of the\nadvent of the “lord of the cycle” (sâhib\nal-amr) – but, of course, the date is not mentioned in the\nencyclopedia. \nGrounding himself on the Sîrat ibn Ḥawshab of the\nFatimid dâ‘î Ja‘far b. Mansūr\nal-Yaman (d. second half of the 10th century), Hamdani\nhypothesizes the epistles to have been written under Ahmad b.\n‘Abd Allâh b. Muḥammad b.\nIsmâ‘îl’s imâmate, who was considered as\nthe expected imâm. Ahmad, however, was not their author,\nbut their munshi’ (“issuer”). Therefore, the\nIkhwân al-Safâ’ would have been a think-tank at the\nservice of the Fatimid propaganda, a secret organization with the\nfunction of gaining support from the non-initiates (Hamdani, Soufan\n2019, 1–2). Moh. Jalub Farhan, however, describes the\nIkhwân as opposed to the Buyid regime, in spite of the fact that\nit supported science (1999, 30, 31). The Brethren who cooperated in\nthe final version of the encyclopedia in the tenth century might have\nbeen disguised adversaries of the Buyids, who were\nShî‘ites, not Ismâ‘îlis. Poonawala\nalso proposes the Rasâ’il to have been written by\npropagandists belonging to the entourage of Ahmad, half a century\nafter al-Ma’mûn (Walker et al. 2015, 66; De Smet 2017,\n157–158). More recently, Hamdani has noted in the encyclopedia\nalso Sunni-Sufi elements; thereby, the Ikhwân would be a secret\nthink-tank made up of tafḍîlî Sunnis (that\nis, they assert the superiority of ‘Alî over all the\nsuccessors of the Prophet), who hoped to replace the ‘Abbasids\nwith a ‘alid caliphate, displaying in their work also liberalism\nand religious tolerance (Hamdani, Soufan 2019, 32–33). \nOn the whole, the political vision outlined above appears to\nbe founded on doctrinal elements of Ismâ‘îli\nnature. The division between the “elect” and the\n“masses” destines the former only for investigation of the\ncurriculum studiorum at the basis of the “philosophy of\nsalvation”. A rigid hierarchy of universe links each level of\nexistence, physical and spiritual, to that which precedes and that\nwhich follows it where the beings that belong to the various levels\ncannot go beyond them. (It should be noted that this may question the\nidea of “evolution” in the Ikhwân that some scholars\nhave ascribed to them; cf. e.g. Vernet Ginés 1990, 190; Marquet\n1992). The didactic aims of the ruler mirror the aspect of\nIsmâ‘îli propaganda known as\nta‘lîm (lit.: “teaching”). \nThe influence of the Epistles on later (after the\n12th century) Ismâ‘îli literature\nhas been widely recognized (Stern 1964, 416–417; Diwald 1975, 26\nss.; Daftary 2007, 236). Their content has been transmitted and\ndeveloped by subsequent thinkers of various persuasions. It is\nnoteworthy, however, that extended literal quotations (and even\ntranslations) from the Ikhwân al-Safâ’ are found in\nthe famous Ismâ‘îli thinker and missionary\nNâsir-e Khosrow (1004–1074) (see Saccone 2007,\n67–68; Baffioni 2013c and Poonawala in Baffioni, Poonawala\n2017, 285 ff.): this may be a proof of the use of the\nRasâ’il in 11th century\nIsmâ‘îli authors. If the Ikhwân\nal-Safâ’ were Ismâ‘îlis or in someway\nlinked to Ismâ‘îlism, then\nIsmâ‘îlism influenced a much wider part of Islamic\nthought and culture than previously recognized. \nWith regard to an Ismâ‘îli commitment to the\nIkhwân al-Safâ’, some aspects of their philosophy of\nnature (geology, mineralogy, and botany) have been recently examined\n(Baffioni 2008, 2009, 2010b; de Callataÿ 2008). Mineralogy and\nbotany have been explored in order to find similarities with\nIsmâ‘îli philosophy, in particular with the\nIsmâ‘îli thinker and missionary Hamîd\nal-Dîn al-Kirmânî. The result is that they share\nmany basic views, but the Ikhwân has greater detail. Moreover,\nsome aspects of the Ikhwân’s cosmology, and in particular\ntheir use of the term and concept of ibdâ‘, are\nrelevant in identifying the similarities (Baffioni 2011a; 2013b;\n2013d). \nHowever, the radical change of hypotheses about the dating of the\nepistles after the identification of the role that Maslama\nal-Qurtubî would have played in them, also led to rethinking the\npolitical (and possibly messianic) beliefs of the Ikhwân and the\nattempts to identify the polemical targets of their assertions.\nMadelung remarks that while the Fatimids were used to see both\nUmayyads and ‘Abbasids as usurpers and enemies of\n‘Alî, the Ikhwân had no longer contacts with any\nhidden imâm, as they believe that the advent of the\nMahdî has been delayed to a remote future. Therefore, they\nadopted a quietist attitude towards the existing regimes: their\npurpose was only to purify Islam through the study of ancient thought,\nthus preparing humanity for the advent of the true Mahdî.\nMaslama al-Qurṭubî remained a loyal subject of the Umayyad\ngovernor of Andalus, ‘Abd al-Raḥmân III. Hence, the\nIkhwân no longer regarded the Umayyads as the inveterate enemies\nof the Family of the Prophet. The imâm, direct\ndescendants of the Prophet, are instead described as the only ones\nentitled to rule humanity, and for this purpose divinely chosen; but\ntheir persecutors – although denounced as tyrants – are\nnot identified.
