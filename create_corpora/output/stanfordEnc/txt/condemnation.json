In addition, the effects of Tempier’s action on the\ncourse of medieval thought in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,\nand even beyond, has been the subject of much debate. The lack of a\ncommonly accepted standard account of Tempier’s actions plus the\nenormous amount of literature and of textual evidence that either\ndirectly or indirectly bears on the events of 1277, puts specific\nlimitations to the present entry. It will be confined to presenting\nthose historical facts that are uncontroversial and to indicating the\nmain issues of current debate with respect to Tempier’s condemnation. \n\n\n\n\nThe traditional picture of the events leading to Bishop Tempier’s\ncondemnation looks something like this. On January 18, 1277 Pope John\nXXI informed Stephen Tempier, Bishop of Paris, in a letter that he had\nheard rumors of heresy and charged him with the task of examining\n(facias inspici vel inquiri) where and by whom these errors\nhad been disseminated (CUP 1: 541). On March 7, 1277, Bishop Tempier\npublished his list of 219 theological and philosophical theses\n(articuli) and of some books that were condemned. Anyone\nteaching or listening to the listed errors would be excommunicated,\nunless they turned themselves in to the bishop or the chancellor within\nseven days, in which case the bishop would inflict proportionate\npenalties (CUP 1: 543). \n\nSince this papal letter precedes Tempier’s condemnation, it has been\ngenerally assumed that Tempier acted on papal initiative, and moreover,\nacted in an overzealous and hasty way. In his letter, the pope merely\nrequested Tempier to investigate rumors of false teaching, whereas the\nlatter responded by drawing up a list of 219 false propositions.\nFurthermore, only about six weeks elapsed between the papal\ninstructions and Tempier’s publication of this list, a list which has\nbeen characterized by historians as repetitious and disorderly. \n\nUnfortunately, the chain of events leading up to Tempier’s\ncondemnation still is not totally clear. If Tempier, indeed, acted on a\npapal mandate, it is surprising that he does not mention it in the\nintroduction to his syllabus of errors, but merely indicates that he\nhad received information from important people (Who these\n“important people” may have been is a question that will be\naddressed below).  \n\nAnother puzzling aspect concerning the course of events sketched\nabove is the papal letter “Flumen aquae vivae” of\nApril 28, 1277, that is, more than forty days after Tempier had\npromulgated his list of condemned articles. Curiously enough, this\nletter gives no indication whatsoever that the pope knew about\nTempier’s action. On the contrary, the pope grants a mandate to Tempier\nto notify him, the pope, about new errors, and to inform him about the\nnames of the propagators of these errors, about their followers, and\nabout their writings. Pope John’s second letter is a further\nspecification of his first: he now indicates the culprits, namely\n“some scholars of arts and in the faculty of theology at\nParis” (nonnulli tam in artibus quam in theologica facultate\nstudentes Parisius). In addition, its purpose is more focused. The\npope will use the dossier that he has requested from the bishop to\nestablish – with the help of an advisory committee – the nature of\nthe errors and to decide whether they will have to be recanted, or\ncondemned and whether the University of Paris will need to be\nreformed. \n\nIn short, the evidence also allows another scenario, namely that\nTempier did not act on the pope’s instigation, but was already in the\nprocess of preparing his condemnation when he received the papal letter\nof January 18, 1277. In this scenario of events, the papal letter\nFlumen aquae vivae crossed the letter in which Tempier\nannounced the condemnation. \n\nTempier’s condemnation is only one of the approximately sixteen\nlists of censured theses that were issued at the University of Paris\nduring the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Most of these lists of\npropositions were put together into systematic collections of\nprohibited articles. One of the earliest of these collections of\nmedieval condemned articles originated towards the end of the\nthirteenth century under the name of Parisian Articles or also\nCollectio errorum in anglia et parisius condempnatorum.\nInitially this collection consisted of twenty-two chapters presenting\nthe errors condemned in 1277 by Archbishop Robert Kilwardby at Oxford,\nin 1241 by Bishop William of Alvernia in Paris, and in 1270 and 1277 by\nBishop Stephen Tempier in Paris (in this order). \n\nDuring the fourteenth century, this Collection grew significantly,\nso that, in fact, a second, augmented Collection came into existence.\nAll the propositions that were added to the first compilation had been\ncondemned in the fourteenth century at the University of Paris. It can\nbe seen as a collection of verdicts, which at the opening of each new\nset of verdicts provides information about the parties involved and the\ndate. The verdicts are not motivated, nor does the collection provide\nan account of the events (narratio). \n\nThe collection of Parisian Articles must have had some kind of\nofficial status, and must have circulated among medieval scholars.\nBachelors in theology were required by oath not to maintain anything\n“in favor of articles that have been condemned at the Roman curia\nor in Paris.” Moreover, many medieval philosophical and\ntheological texts contain references to and quotations from the\n“Parisian articles,” which by no means should always be\nidentified with Tempier’s list of condemned articles. \n\nIf one compares Tempier’s 1277 syllabus to the other lists of errors\nassembled in the compilation of Parisian Articles two features stand\nout, namely the anonymity of its targets and its promulgation by a\nbishop. Tempier does not specify the persons behind the false views,\nbut merely states that the errors were disseminated by “certain\nscholars at the faculty of arts.” The other condemnations,\nhowever, all concern specific scholars whose names are explicitly\nmentioned in the Collectio errorum. In addition, it is one of\nthe few censures in which a bishop was involved right from the start,\nand not, for instance, at a later stage of the proceedings as judge of\nan appeal. \n\nIn his introductory letter to the syllabus of errors, Tempier\nindicates that he responded to information received from important\npeople (magnarum et gravium personarum crebra zeloque fidei accensa\ninsinuavit relatio). The allegations were that “some\nscholars of arts at Paris” (nonnulli Parisius studentes in\nartibus) had been transgressing the limits of their own faculty\n(proprie facultatis limites excedentes). In all likelihood,\nthis complaint stemmed from theological circles. \n\nIn his introductory letter, Tempier also reports that he sought the\nadvice “not only of the doctors of Sacred Scripture, but also of\nother wise men” (tam doctorum sacrae Scripturae, quam aliorum\nprudentium virorum communicato consilio). From other cases of\nsuspect teaching we know that the task of the theologians was to\nexamine certain works and draw up a list of errors. In cases where a\nlist of alleged errors already existed, the theologians were charged\nwith assessing the degree of error of the listed propositions. The\ntheologian John of Pouilly reports that sixteen masters of theology\nwere Tempier’s assessors for the condemnation. One of the members of\nthe commission was Henry of Ghent, as he himself testifies in his\nQuodlibet II. It is unknown when these masters met, but it\nmust have been after Henry of Ghent had become a regent master in\ntheology, a position that he obtained in 1276. That there were some\ntensions between Tempier and the theologians is attested by Giles of\nRome, a contemporary witness of the events of 1277: he claimed that\nsome articles were condemned not on the basis of the advice of the\nmasters, but rather due to the “obstinacy of a few.” This\nobservation has been taken to concern Tempier, but it might also have\nincluded some of the “wise men” who had assisted him. \n\nThe identity of these other wise men is unknown. Since, however,\nthey are so clearly distinguished from the theologians, they have to be\nsought among the prelates. Of these, only the involvement of the\nchancellor, John of Alleux, is directly substantiated by the textual\nevidence: the introductory letter to Tempier’s condemnation stipulated\nthat offenders had to report either to the bishop himself or to the\nchancellor. Other likely candidates are Simon of Brion, the papal\nlegate, and Ranulph of Houblonnire, Tempier’s future successor as\nbishop of Paris. \n\nIn addition, mention should be made of the possible role of the\ninquisitor of France, Simon du Val. On November 23, 1276 he had\nsummoned three ex-scholars from Paris, now residing in Liège, to\nappear before his court “probably and gravely suspect of the\ncrime of heresy” (de crimine heresis probabiliter et\nvehementer suspectos). They were Siger of Brabant, canon at Saint\nPaul’s, and Goswin of Chapelle and Bernier of Nivelles, canons at Saint\nMartin’s, all in Liège. At least one of them, Siger of Brabant,\nwas also implicated in Tempier’s condemnation (see below). Although\nthere is no firm textual evidence, it is tempting to speculate that the\ninquisitor’s dossier concerning these three arts masters was known to\nBishop Tempier. \n\nThe condemnation of 1277 not only covered the already mentioned\nsyllabus of 219 errors, but also the work “De\namore” by Andreas Capellanus, a treatise on geomancy with\nthe incipit “Estimaverunt Indi” and the explicit\n“Racionare ergo super eum, et invenies, etc.” –\nwhich has not yet been identified – and unnamed treatises on\nnecromancy, witchcraft, or fortune-telling. \n\nOf interest to historians of philosophy is the list of censured\npropositions. It is unknown what method Tempier and his advisers used\nto draw up their syllabus of 219 errors. Usually, it is claimed that\nTempier’s list not very well organised and “broad in scope to the\npoint of confusion.” However, the lack of doctrinal cohesion is\nalso present in other lists of the Collectio errorum, simply\nbecause the order in which the charged errors appeared on the roll was\ndetermined by other factors such as, for instance, the order in which\nthey appeared in the examined work. Shortly after 1277 the extremely\nlong list of 219 prohibited views was reorganized, possibly to\nfacilitate its use in the academic community. At the beginning of this\ncentury, Pierre Mandonnet once again put Tempier’s articles into a new\norder, numbering and distinguishing the 179 philosophical theses from\nthe 40 theological ones. \n\nA very helpful summary of the condemned propositions has been\nprovided by John F. Wippel. The first seven of the philosophical\npropositions bear on the nature and excellence of philosophy.\nPropositions 8 through 12 (in the numbering of Mandonnet) have a\nbearing on the knowability and nature of God. Propositions 13–15\nconcern divine knowledge, and 16 through 26 divine omnipotence. Many of\nthe articles, notably 34–61 regard the separate intelligences (angels).\nAnother interesting group of articles is 67–69. By condemning these\narticles, Tempier endorsed God’s absolute power to do whatever he\nwills. Other interesting themes that are touched in the philosophical\narticles are the world’s eternity (80 through 89), the unicity of the\nhuman intellect and its implications (117 through 133), and human\nfreedom and free will (151 through 166). Among the theological\narticles, themes that appear are theology as a science (180–186), the\ndoctrine of the Eucharist (196–199), Christian morality (202–205), and\nhuman immortality and reward and punishment in the life to come\n(213–219). It should be emphasized that Tempier’s theses express\npositions that cannot be maintained in light of revealed truth; for\nthis reason, each is followed by the qualification, “error”. Recently, Sylvain Piron has argued that Tempier’s list of condemned\narticles does exhibit an encyclopedic organization, which suggests\nthat Tempier had a deliberate plan. Articles 25–183 can be divided\ninto sub-sections which respectively touch upon the topics of God,\nangels, the world, the soul, the intellect, the will, philosophy, the\nwill again (due to the misplacement of a rubric), and ethics. The same\nglobal order is also present in articles 1–24. The final articles,\n184–219, seem to be a miscellaneous collection. Possibly, Tempier’s\nlist actually consists of three separate lists.\n \n\nThe question of who the targets were of Tempier’s condemnation\ncannot be entirely separated from the question of what views were\ncensured. As was mentioned above, Tempier did not identify the targets\nof his condemnation, but merely indicated that it was directed against\nunspecified members of the arts faculty in Paris. Even though their\nnames appear nowhere in the document itself (and in the rubrics of only\ntwo of the many medieval manuscripts which have preserved Tempier’s\ncondemnation), Siger of Brabant and Boethius of Dacia have been singled\nout as the most prominent targets of the 1277 censure. \n\nYet, their identification should be qualified, as becomes clear from\nthe results, or should one say lack of results, of the ground-breaking\nstudy by Roland Hissette. He tried to identify the proximate background\nof the 219 condemned theses. As his point of departure, Hissette took\nknown works by Siger and Boethius and three anonymous writings from the\narts faculty that were available in a modern edition at the time that\nhe wrote his study. From Hissette’s own summary of the results of his\ncareful examination it appears that surprisingly few of the censured\npropositions could be identified with any degree of certainty in the\nknown works of thirteenth-century artistae. Of the 219\npropositions, only 79 can be identified, with various degrees of\nprobability, in the works of Siger of Brabant, Boethius of Dacia, or\nthe three anonymous writings. Of 72 propositions the attribution is\nuncertain, whereas 68 propositions could not be identified at all.\nMoreover, many censured propositions that seem to have been derived\nfrom the examined works that originated at the arts faculty in the\nthirteenth century do not really represent the author’s own view, but\nrather appear to be quotations or paraphrases from Aristotle,\nfrom Arabic philosophers, or from “the philosophers”\nas Hissette himself indicates. \n\nHissette’s examination was based on the assumption that Tempier’s\ncensure envisioned only teachings from the faculty of arts. The\nintroductory letter, however, seems to contradict this assumption.\nThere, Tempier draws an important distinction, which has not been duly\nrecognized in the scholarly literature, between propagators and views.\nHe accuses the members of the arts faculty of disseminating\n(tractare et disputare) manifest and damned errors\n(manifesti et exsecrabiles errores). The errors are specified\nin the roll or leaves connected to the introductory letter (in\nrotulo seu cedulis, praesentibus hiis annexo seu annexis). They\nare the 219 censured propositions. Tempier does not state, however,\nthat the members of the arts faculty are the authors of these\nerrors. In his introductory letter Tempier separates the 219 censured\nerrors from their propagators. Only the propagators have to be sought\nin the arts faculty in Paris: on pain of excommunication, they are\nprohibited to dogmatize, disseminate, or sustain in any way\n(dogmatizare, aut defendere seu sustinere quoquo modo) the\npropositions collected by Tempier. The origin of these propositions,\nhowever, is not stated in the introductory letter. In other words,\nTempier indicates that those artistae who were castigated for\ndisseminating false teachings were not necessarily disseminating their\nown views. When drawing up the syllabus, Tempier and his\nadvisers relied on more sources, written or oral, than those that were\nused by Hissette. Possibly, Tempier’s list even included earlier lists\nof suspect views. \n\nThe inconclusiveness of Hissette’s study strongly suggests that\nresearch into the proximate background of the censured propositions has\nto be broadened. The directions that such research should take are\nindicated, either implicitly or explicitly, by Roland Hissette, and by\nother scholars such as John Wippel and Calvin Normore. Today it is\ngenerally agreed that a considerable number of the 219 censured\npropositions have a bearing on the reintroduction of pagan philosophy\ninto the arts faculty, and on the ensuing crisis over the relation of\nfaith and reason. Consequently, Greek or Arabic sources may prove to be\nat the origin of a number of censured propositions, as is also\nsuggested in Tempier’s preface, in which he indicated that the scholars\nwhose errors he condemned took their inspiration from pagan writings\n(cum errores praedictos gentilium scripturis muniant), \nOther propositions may well have been derived from the teaching of\ntheologians, such as Thomas Aquinas. In particular, John Wippel has\nargued (against Roland Hissette) that Aquinas’ teaching was also\nimplied in Tempier’s condemnation and that some of the positions were\ntaken from his writings. In this respect, the oft-quoted statement from\nTempier’s introductory letter that members of the arts faculty were\ntransgressing the limits of their own faculty (propriae facultatis\nlimites excedentes) could acquire new meaning. Some members of the\narts faculty were rebuked not only for teaching suspect philosophical\nviews but also for teaching suspect theological views. \nAnother, complementary, line of inquiry has been suggested by Malcolm\nDe Mowbray. According to him, many of the theses may have originated\nfrom students during disputations in the schools. Given the oral\ncharacter of these exercises, it is only natural that they are\ndifficult to trace in extant works from masters of arts. Evidence for\nhis interpretation has De Mowbray found in Boethius of Dacia’s De\naeternitate mundi, which, according to him, was meant to help students\nto hold a disputation. Much of De Mowbray’s interpretation hinges on\nour understanding of the Preface of Tempier’s condemnation, which\nmentions some people at the arts-faculty (nonnulli Parisius studentes\nin artibus) who had discussed and disputed the condemned articles in\nthe schools (in scolis tractare et disputare presumunt, ut eis\nnescient respondere). His interpretation has been contested by Luca\nBianchi. \n\nTempier’s condemnation has often been depicted as the most dramatic\nand significant doctrinal censure in the history of the University of\nParis, and a landmark in the history of medieval philosophy and\ntheology. Yet, the doctrinal significance of the condemnation has\nreceived very diverse assessments. Since the appearance of the studies\nby Pierre Mandonnet and Fernand van Steenberghen, Tempier’s\ncondemnation has come to be associated with the opposition between\nfaith and reason, caused by the introduction of newly translated\nphilosophical sources in the Latin West, in particular Aristotle and\nhis commentator Averroes. Studies which present Tempier’s condemnation\nas a response to “Averroism” or to “radical\nAristotelianism,” follow this line of interpretation. \n\nThis interpretation is often associated with the view that Tempier’s\naction was a symptom of an already existing opposition to rationalism,\nthat is, against philosophical research pursued without concern for\nChristian orthodoxy. Evidence of the presence of rationalist tendencies\nat the University of Paris was found in certain articles of Tempier’s\nsyllabus, or in the prefatory letter in which Tempier expounded his\nnotion of double truth. According to Tempier, some scholars maintained\nthat certain views were true according to philosophy, but not according\nto Catholic faith, “as if there were two contrary truths, and as\nif against the truth of Sacred Scripture, there is truth in the sayings\nof the condemned pagans.” \n\nThe so-called theory of double truth has been the source of much\nconfusion. Nowadays, scholars agree that there were no medieval authors\nwho entertained the philosophically absurd theory that two\ncontradictory propositions – one derived from philosophical\ninvestigation, the other from Christian revelation--can both be true at\nthe same time. Rather, Tempier’s reproach should be taken as an attempt\nto ridicule the hermeneutical practice of commentators to evaluate a\ndoctrine (for instance Aristotle’s) from a philosophical point of\nview (“philosophically speaking”) and from faith. In\nreality, however, medieval scholars generally supposed that in cases of\nconflict between reason and faith, the truth was always on the side of\nthe faith. \n\nIn more recent times, the idea that Tempier’s condemnation was a\nsymptom of the existence of rationalist currents at the University of\nParis, in the sense of the emergence of philosophy as an autonomous\ndiscipline vis-à-vis divine revelation, has been further\ndeveloped by scholars such as Alain de Libera, Kurt Flasch, and Luca\nBianchi. Although there are differences in detail and in emphasis, they\nview Tempier’s action as an attempt to curb the concept of philosophy\nas a comprehensive doctrine of natural knowledge aimed at the\nattainment of happiness here in this life, rather than after death.\nTheir studies about the significance of Tempier’s condemnation also\naddress fundamental questions about the nature of philosophy in the\nMiddle Ages.  \n\nIn the historiography of medieval science, the views of Pierre\nDuhem, have proven to be extremely influential. Duhem believed that\nTempier, with his insistence of God’s absolute power, had liberated\nChristian thought from the dogmatic acceptance of Aristotelianism, and\nin this way marked the birth of modern science. Especially articles 39\nand 49 played a pivotal role in his eyes. Duhem’s thesis has opened up\nthe historiography of medieval science as a serious academic\ndiscipline. Yet, at the same time, no one in the field any longer\nendorses his view that modern science started in 1277. Of contemporary\nhistorians of science, Edward Grant probably comes closest to Duhem’s\nvision, though his view includes many refinements and historical\nmaterials that were unknown to Duhem. \nIn any case, it is clear that the condemnation did have an impact on\nscholars at the university. Peter of Auvergne, for instance, wrote two\nsets of questions on Aristotle’s De caelo, one of which was posterior\nto Tempier’s condemnation. There, Peter of Auvergne changed his views\non such crucial issues as the world’s eternity, the animation of the\nheavens and the existence of an infinite multitude. \n\nAlthough Tempier’s action of March 7, 1277 is best known in the\nhistoriography of philosophy, mention should also be made of two\nadditional doctrinal investigations of 1277 that are attributed to\nBishop Tempier. The first one concerned the theologian Giles of Rome,\nand was concluded before March 28, 1277 with the censure of fifty-one\npropositions taken from Giles’s commentary on the Sentences.\nThe second doctrinal inquiry was aimed against Thomas Aquinas. It was\nbegun after Giles’s censure, but still before March 28, 1277. According\nto Robert Wielockx, the inquiry against Thomas Aquinas was never\ncompleted. Basing his conclusions on evidence provided in a letter by\nJohn Pecham, Wielockx claimed that during the vacancy of the Apostolic\nSee, sometime between May 20 and November 25, 1277, Tempier received\norders from the curia to stop his investigation. \n\nWielockx’s thesis of a separate process against Thomas Aquinas has\nbeen generally accepted in the scholarly literature. However, recently\nthe historical evidence has been reexamined and his interpretation been\nquestioned by John Wippel and Hans Thijssen, the latter in the context\nof a substantially revised account of the juridical procedures against\nGiles of Rome.","contact.mail":"hthijssen@phil.ru.nl","contact.domain":"phil.ru.nl"}]
