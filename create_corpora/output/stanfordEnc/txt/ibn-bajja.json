The Muslim community was much larger and it defined the\ncultural space, a significant part of which was made by Arabic\ntranslations of Greek scientifical and philosophical works.\n\n\nBy the midst of the 10th century CE, materials related to\nthe circle of the Brethren of Purity were known in al-Andalus\nprobably brought in by Maslama Ibn Qasim al-Qurtubi\n(d. 353/964). But philosophy in its proper sense is first found in\nShelomo Ibn Gabirol or Avicebron (1021–1058). The great figure\nof Medieval Judaism who was active in Saragossa was also a talented\nphilosopher. He preceded, by over two generations, the first Muslim\nphilosophers of Al-Andalus: Abu s-Salt Umayya ibn ʽAbd\nal-ʽAziz ibn Abi s-Salt ad-Dani (d. 1134) and Ibn Bâjja, or\nAvempace (d. 1139), the latter being active also in that northern town.\n\n\nThe reasons for the later development of philosophy in Muslim\nAl-Andalus, therefore, cannot be explained only by the fact that the\ncountry was situated far away from that nurturing source. The cause is\nlikely that philosophy was never central to the Islamic intellectual\nconstellation and that it flourished in peripheral areas, geographical\nas well as doctrinal. The greatest evidence is Ibn Sina (d. 1037) who\nlived in the Iranian provinces, never visited Baghdad and enjoyed the\npatronage of princes friendly to the Shiʻa. Al-Andalus was\nperipheral in geographical, but not in doctrinal, terms. The country\nfollowed Sunni orthodoxy and the Malekite school of law prevailed\nwhile Ash‛arite theology was weakly cultivated. When Abu l-Qasim\nSaʽid Ibn Saʽid (d. 1070) devoted a chapter of his world\nhistory of the sciences and philosophy to Al-Andalus, his information\nabout philosophy was significantly scarce (Saʽid 1998:\n96–108; 1991: 58–78).  In spite of the circumstances\nretarding its development, philosophy in Al-Andalus blossomed into\nmaturity with Ibn Bâjja.\n\n\nC.E. dates are used in the entry unless an Anno Hegirae date is also\nwritten; in this case they are separate by a slash—A.H. is set\nbefore and C.E. after it. No transliteration characters are used\nexcept for Ibn Bâjja, where ‘â’ indicates a\nlong ‘a’ vowel.\n\nAbu Bakr Muhammad Ibn Yahyà ibn as-Sa’igh at-Tujibi Ibn\nBâjja was known to the Latin philosophers as Avempace. We can\nassume that he was born in Saragossa around 1085, when the city was\nthe capital of the Taifa kingdom of the Banu Hud; Yusuf\nal-Mu’tamin Ibn Hud reigned from 1081–1085, and his\nsuccessor al-Mustaʻin II reigned until the year 1110 when he was\nkilled in the battle of Valtierra. Alfonso the Christian King of\nAragon won this battle. Avempace may have been in the service of\nal-Musta‛in II Ibn Hud (Maqqari-N: vol. 7, p. 25). He was\nfollowed by ʻImad ad-Dawla Ibn Hud who stayed in power only for a\nfew months. In the same year, 1110, he was overthrown by the Almoravid\nSultan ʽAli ibn Yusuf Ibn Tashfin (ruled 1107–1143), who\nsent Abu ‛Abd Allah Muhammad Ibn al-Hajj, governor of Valencia\n(and the East province), with the Almoravid army to conquer Saragossa.\nʽImad ad-Dawla had to leave the town and retire to Rueda, a\nfortress located some distance from Saragossa. \nAfter Ibn al-Hajj’s death in 1114, the Almoravid Sultan\nappointed his brother-in-law Abu Bakr ʽAli ibn Ibrahim\nas-Sahrawi, known as Ibn Tifilwit, as the governor of the\n province.[1]\n The connection of Avempace to Ibn Tifilwit is well attested by both\nIbn Khaqan and Ibn al-Khatib. Avempace composed panegyrics for Ibn\nTifilwit who rewarded him lavishly. Avempace also wrote poems of the\nmuwasshaha kind that pleased him, and they both enjoyed music\nand wine. Abu Bakr Ibn Tifilwit nominated Avempace his vizier, and\nAvempace went to meet the deposed ‛Imad ad-Dawla Ibn Hud King in\nhis castle apparently in a diplomatic mission, but he ended up in jail\nfor some months. Ibn Tifilwit died in 510/1116 in an operation against\nthe Christians and Avempace composed moving elegies in his memory. \nKing Alfonso the Battler conquered Saragossa from the\nAlmoravids on December 18, 1118, after a long blockade. It is not\nclear whether Avempace then left town or had already left. We know\nthat he looked for shelter in Xàtiba in the court of Abu Ishaq\nIbrahim ibn Yusuf Ibn Tashufin, known as Ibn Taʽyasht because\nTa‛yasht was the name of his Berber mother. Ibrahim was a\nbrother of the Sultan ‛Ali Ibn Yusuf Ibn Tashfin (d. 1143), and\ngovernor of Murcia and the Eastern part of al-Andalus. Avempace was\nagain imprisoned and we may guess the causes. Abu Marwan ‛Abd\nMalik bn Abi l-‛Ala’ Zuhr (d. 1161) was a famous physician\nin the service of Ibrahim (he wrote for him the Kitab\nal-Iqtisad), and al-Maqqari informs us that there was an extreme\nenmity between Avempace and the father of ‛Abd al-Malik, also a\nphysician, named Abu l-‛Ala’ Zuhr (d. 1130) (Maqqari-N:\nvol. 3, pp. 432–434). Even worse for him, Abu Nasr al-Fath Ibn\nMuhammad Ibn Khaqan (d. 1134?) was also a courtier of Ibn\nTa‛yasht, to whom he devoted the Qala’id\n al-iqyan[2]\n a poetry anthology where he contemptuously put Avempace in last place\n(Ibn Khaqan 1966: 346–353).\nThe court of Ibrahim ibn Yusuf was not a welcoming place for him. \nIn spite of the incident, Avempace remained within the Almoravid\ncircle for the rest of his life and for approximately twenty years\nserved as vizier of the mentioned Yahyà ibn Yusuf Ibn Tashfin,\nanother brother of the Sultan ‛Ali Ibn Yusuf Ibn Tashufin in the\nMaghrib. Vincent Lagardère has done the most extended research\non the Almoravids in recent times and provided us with information on\nall the children of Yusuf Ibn Tashfin (Lagardère 1989: 80 and\n174–178). Nevertheless, Lagardère has not found any\ninformation on Yahyà other than he was a son of Yusuf and his\nwife Zaynab, and that he was born around 477/1084. Thus, he was of a\nsimilar age to Avempace. \nFrom around 1118 until 1136, we have no further information on\nAvempace’s life. In 1136, he was in Seville and his disciple Abu\nl-Hasan Ibn al-Imam was in his company (IB-coll-alawi: 87). He\nmentions in one of his writings that he is moving to Oran\n(IB-coll-genequand: 202 §60), maybe in his planned trip to Egypt\n(IB-coll-genequand: 90 §1). Nevertheless, three years later, in\nRamadan 533/ May 1139, Avempace died in Fez. \nAs for the causes of his death, several sources point to poisoning.\nAl-Maqqari recounts that Ibn Ma‛yub was a servant of the\nphysician Abu l-‛Ala’ Ibn Zuhr, his enemy, and that Ibn\nMa‛yub was suspected of poisoning him with an eggplant\n(Maqqari-N: vol. 4, pp. 12–13), but Abu l-‛Ala’ Zuhr\n(not Ibn Zuhr) had already died in 1130 at Cordova, and lived in\nSeville most of his life. \nThe Almoravids bestowed their support on Avempace and other non\nreligious scholars in spite of being very reverential to the Malikite\njurists. Abu ‛Abd Allah Malik ibn Yahyà Ibn Wuhayb\nal-Azdi (1061–1130) (Dunlop 1955b) cultivated all sciences\nincluding philosophy but none of his works is extant. Nevertheless,\nthe Amir al-Mu’minin ‛Ali ibn Yusuf Ibn Tashfin made him\nhis vizier and his friend. Al-Maqqari informs us that ‛Ali\ncalled him from Seville to Marrakech and appointed him qadi\nof Marrakech. He ordered him to discuss religious matters with Ibn\nTumart, the intellectual founder of the Almohad movement (Maqqari-N:\nvol. 3, pp. 479–480). Al-Maqqari says that Avempace supported\nhim, but we do not know anything more about their relationship\n(Maqqari-N: 3: 434). \nWe are better informed about his friends Abu Ja‛far Yusuf ibn\n Hasday[3]\n and Abu l-Hasan ‛Ali ibn ‛Abd al-‛Aziz Ibn al-Imam\n al-Ansari.[4]\n Ibn al-Imam was from Saragossa too and was vizier of Abu Tahir Tamim\nIbn Yusuf Ibn Tashfin al-Mu‛izz, (1072–1126) the eldest\nson of Yusuf Ibn Tashfin, brother of the ruling Sultan and governor of\nGranada and later of the whole al-Andalus. Tamim was a hero, being the\nwinner in the battle of Uclés in 1108. \nIbn al-Imam and Avempace were friends for years; we have several\nletters that Avempace wrote to him on philosophical issues. Dunlop\ntranslated the beginning of an incomplete letter of Avempace to Ibn\nal-Imam in which Avempace refers to a treatise he composed during his\nsecond\n imprisonment.[5]\n As Ibn Khaqan reported, Avempace was imprisoned by Abu Ishaq Ibrahim\nibn Yusuf Ibn Tashfin for a second time, after 1118.  \nAvempace’s works are mainly preserved in following manuscripts:\n \nThe copyist of manuscript Pococke 206 wrote on folio 120a that he\ncopied his text from an original that included the handwriting of Ibn\nal-Imam. “The vizier finished the reading of this section under\nhim [Avempace] on the 15th of Ramadan 530” (June 17,\n1136) and the place was Seville (IB-coll-alawi: 87). Ibn al-Imam was governor (‛amil) of the\ntown and in charge of the poll-tax, the copyist added. \nWhen Ibn al-Imam decided to move to the East, Avempace composed the Epistle of the\nFarewell Message as a spiritual companion for the travel. Since\nAvempace died in May 1139, Ibn al-Imam should have left al-Andalus\nbetween 1136 and 1139, after he finished copying many texts of\nAvempace which he took with him. From his manuscript another one, the\nmentioned Pococke 206, was copied in Qus, in the upper Egypt in\n547/1152 by al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad Ibn\nan-Nadr when Ibn al-Imam was alive. Thus, 1152 is the earliest date\nfor Ibn al-Imam’s death. \nAbu Ja‛far Yusuf ibn Hasday is also the recipient of a letter\nfrom Avempace in which he refers to the astronomer az-Zarqalluh,\nAzarquiel (d. ca. 1000), and also writes about his own order\nof\n learning.[6]\n Abu Ja‛far (d. 1123) was the great-great-grandson of the famous\nJewish scholar and statesman Hasday Ibn Shaprut (ca. 910–ca.\n970; Stroumsa 2016). Ibn Abi Usaybi‛a includes in Abu\nJa‛far’s biography his history of\n physicians,[7]\n and reports his friendship with Avempace. Sa‛id Ibn Sa‛id\ngives a biography of probably his grandfather, Abu l-Fadl Hasday ibn\nYusuf (fl. 485/1092), “of the city of Saragossa and of the\nJewish nobility in al-Andalus” who was first to read\nAristotle’s Physics and De caelo in\n al-Andalus.[8] \nAbu Ja‛far Yusuf ibn Hasday moved to the East and from 1121 to\n1125 he worked for al-Ma’mun al-Bata’ihi, a vizier of the\nFatimid Caliph al-Amir. He wrote for him commentaries on Hippocrates\nand was involved in building an observatory at Cairo known as the\nMa’muni Observatory (Maqrizi 1913: 174–176).\nThe observatory was demolished when\nthe vizier fell into disgrace in 1125. Dunlop added a few names to the\ncircle of Avempace, like Abu l-Hasan Ibn Judi, a younger friend, but\nMalik Ibn Wuhayb, ‛Ali Ibn al-Imam and Abu Ja‛far Ibn\nHasday are the outstanding figures in his circle. See\n Annex 1\n for a discussion of sources on his life. \nIbn al-Imam (IB-coll-fakhry: 177–178) produced the first list of\nAvempace’s writings, which was followed by Ibn Abi\nUsaybi‛a in his bio-bibliography (mentioned above, 1886, 2001).\nA scholarly account was first made\nby the late Jamal ad-Din al-‛Alawi (1983) who not only described\nmanuscripts and printings, but also tried to determine which works\nascribed to Avempace are authentic, as well as to establish the\nchronology of his writings and, on this basis, to draw a developmental\naccount of his thought. \nAl-‛Alawi based his chronology on the before mentioned letter\nwhich Avempace sent to his friend Abu Ja‛far Yusuf ibn Hasday in\nwhich he explained that he first learned about mathematical sciences,\nmusic and astronomy. He went on to study logic using the books of\nAlfarabi and later devoted himself to physics, the philosophy of\nnature. We understand that Avempace had not worked with metaphysics\nyet. J. Al-‛Alawi distinguished three stages in Avempace’s\ndevelopment and classified his writings according to these stages. His\nwritings on music, astronomy and logic belong to the first stage;\nthose on natural philosophy to the second; and those most\nrepresentative of his thinking—the Rule of the\nSolitary, the Epistle of Conjunction and the\nFarewell Message—to the third and last stage. \nAvempace himself tells us how these sciences are organized. Ibn\nBâjja followed other Andalusians in turning to Abu Nasr\nal-Farabi, Alfarabi (d. ca. 950), for instruction in logic\nand in classifying the sciences. Alfarabi is the author of a treatise\n“enumerating” the sciences (Farabi 1952)\nand some books of the introductory\ngenre: Epistle with which the book on logic begins (Dunlop\n1957a), Sections\ncontaining all what needs the beginner in logic (Dunlop 1955a),\nand the Book of the Eisagoge or Introduction (Dunlop\n1956). \nAvempace wrote commentaries on many of them, beginning with his\nannotations on the Chapters and on the Eisagoge,\nmixed with ones on the Categories. His annotations are\npreserved in two manuscripts: Oxford Pococke 206 and, to a larger\nextent, Escorial Derenbourg 612. These annotations on the three books\nbelonging to the introductory genre are often intermingled and may\noffer different versions (‛Alawi 1983: 80–83). \nPorphyry’s Eisagoge was translated into Arabic by Abu\n‛Uthman Ya‛qub ad-Dimashqi (fl. 914) and his\ntranslation was used by Alfarabi in his Book of the Eisagoge\n(Isaghuji) or Introduction (Madkhal). In his Eisagoge,\nPorphyry established five universal “meanings”: genus,\nspecies, differentia, property, and accident, as the foundations of\nlogic, the first element of a chain, the highest development of which\nis the syllogism. Alfarabi opened his Introduction with the\nfollowing statement: \nOur purpose in this book is the enumeration of the things of which\njudgments are composed and into which they are divided, i.e., the\nparts of parts of the syllogistic expressions employed in general in\nall the syllogistic arts. (Eisagoge [Dunlop 1956: 127,\n{Arabic 118.3–4}]) \nAvempace comments on his words but when he comes to “in all the\nsyllogistic arts”, he moves to another treatise of Alfarabi\n(Risalah [Dunlop 1957a: Arabic, pp. 225–225, English\ntransl. 230–231]), and seizes the opportunity to expound on\ntheir common classification of the syllogistic arts. There are five:\n“philosophy and the [four] arts”. The four arts are\ndialectic, sophistic, rhetoric, and poetry. He uses Alfarabi’s\nwords and explains what makes them syllogistic: “It is in the\nnature of the syllogistic arts to be employed [for their own sake]\nonce they are assembled and completed, and not to have an action as\ntheir\n end”.[9] \nPhilosophy embraces all beings “insofar as it knows them with\ncertain science” (IB-taaliq: 27). Thus, two\nrequirements are to be fulfilled: certainty of knowledge and\nuniversality of scope, and these requirements hold only for the five\ndivisions of philosophy: metaphysics, physics, practical philosophy,\nmathematics, and logic. \nMetaphysics aims at those beings which are the ultimate causes; they\nare neither a body nor in a body. Physics or natural science aims at\nthe natural bodies, the existence of which does not depend on human\nwill at all. Practical philosophy—which Avempace calls\n“voluntary science”—aims at beings produced by the\nhuman will and choice. \nMathematics deals with beings abstract from their matters, although\nendowed with number and measure, and is divided into arithmetic,\ngeometry, optics, astronomy, music, mechanics or the science of\nweights, and the “science of devices,” which studies: \nHow to bring into existence many of the things proved theoretically in\nmathematics, where the worth of the device consists of removing\nhindrances that, perhaps, hindered their existence. There are\nnumerical devices—like the algebra, geometrical ones—like\nthose for measuring the surface of bodies which are impossible to\naccess, astronomical devices, optical—like the art of\nmirrors— musical, and mechanical. (Alwuzad 1988: 253.\n7–11; IB-taaliq: 28. 9–11) \nWe shall soon see that astronomy occupies a particular place in the\nsystem because its subject results from optical observation. Logic is\nthe fifth and last division of philosophy and focuses on properties\nthat beings acquire in the human mind; “because of such\nproperties and their knowledge [logic] becomes an instrument for\napprehending the right and the truth in beings” (IB-taaliq: 28.\n13–14). Avempace remarks that for this reason some people\nconsider logic to be only an instrument and not a part of philosophy,\nbut insofar as these properties have real existence, logic can be\nintegrated into philosophy. He concludes that logic is both part and\ninstrument of philosophy. \nSince a distinguishing feature of philosophy is the use of the\napodictic syllogism (burhan) because it is the only one that\nyields certain knowledge, not all syllogistic sciences can be\nconsidered parts of philosophy by Avempace. He enumerates four such\nnon-philosophical arts: Dialectic relies only on opinion and negates\nor asserts something through methods of general acceptance. Sophistry\naims at beings insofar as it misrepresents them and deceives us: it\nmakes the false look true, and the true, false. And following the\ntradition initiated by the Greek commentators on Aristotle, Avempace\nincludes Rhetoric and Poetics in logic (IB-taaliq:\n28–29). These four arts use other kinds of syllogism but only to\nconvince another, not to infer the truth, whereas philosophy causes\nman to convince another and to infer the truth for\n himself.[10] \nThe classification of the sciences, indeed, is not complete because\nthe aforementioned arts are all theoretical and arts like medicine or\nagriculture have not been considered. Alfarabi distinguished, at the\nbeginning of his Risala, between syllogistic and\nnon-syllogistic arts and aligned medicine, agriculture, carpentry with\nthe second. They were non-syllogistic because, once their parts were\nassembled they resulted in doing something, not in employing a\nsyllogism (Dunlop 1957a: 225). He admitted, nevertheless, that some\nparts of these non-syllogistic arts were brought out by syllogisms,\nand he mentioned medicine, agriculture and navigation. \nAvempace was not as systematic as Alfarabi but he picked up the\nforgotten non-syllogistic arts, changed them into “practical\narts”, and wrote: \nIf some of them [the practical arts] employ syllogisms as medicine and\nagriculture do, they are not called syllogistic because their purpose\nis not [to convince another] nor to employ syllogisms, but to do some\nactivity. (IB-taaliq: 29. 17–20) \nAvempace wrote nine medical treatises (Forcada 2011: 113–114).\nForcada has edited, studied, and translated one of them, his\n“Commentary on Aphorisms”, a supercommentary on\nGalen’s commentary on Hippocrates’ Aphorisms which\nillustrates Avempace’s view about medicine. Medical syllogisms\nhave their premises specifically obtained by means of experience.\nExperience is obtained on its turn by means of perception through\none’s life time. Avempace defines tajriba,\nexperience: \nAs man’s reliance on perception to know particular [aspects,\njuz’iyyat] of some matter so that some science results\nfrom this perception. \nExperience is said in general and in particular. If it is said in\ngeneral, it points out that perception intents knowing particular\n[aspects] of a matter, from which a universal proposition results. The\nparticular [instances] may take place either by man’s will or\nnaturally. (Forcada 2011: 146) \nTherefore, Avempace ranks experience not as high in certitude as the\nfirst intelligible but second to it, and he makes it essential part of\nmedicine, insofar as it can yield universal propositions. \nAvempace occupied himself again with the issue of the classification\nof sciences in his introduction to the Book of Animals\n(IB-BA). He placed the science of animals within natural philosophy,\nwhich falls again within theoretical philosophy. \nEvery theoretical science is composed of principles and problems. The\nresults may be called problems (masa’il). The\nprinciples can be concepts (tasawwur) and they are uttered by\nspoken sounds that are individual in potency or in actions. The\nprinciples can be given assent to (tasdiq) and they are\nuttered by sentences that are statement-making and necessary. \nThere are sciences like geometry where the principles are more general\nand anterior. By “principles”, I mean these concepts\n(tasawwurat): the triangle is anterior to the equilateral\ntriangle and to other kinds of triangles. (IB-BA: 65.5–11) \nIbn Bâjja employs the term tasawwur in a broad sense,\nsince tasawwur in its proper sense does not express\nstatements as it here does, but concepts. He is employing also\n“problems” in a rare sense since he means here\n“statements”, he goes on and says: \nAnteriority can be either in itself or in relation to us because of\nour assent that objects equal to a third one are equal is anterior to\nour assent that the sides of the triangle the vertex of which lays\nabove equal angles are equal. In these examples, the predicates in the\nprinciples are the causes of the predicates in the problems, and they\nare anterior in both aspects. (IB-BA: 65.16–66.4) \nGeometry and arithmetic do not employ the senses at all but mechanics\nand optics do; although their subject matters are sensible beings,\nthey are in “remote common sensibles”. Mechanics and\noptics differ from astronomy because the subject of astronomy is\nsensible; it needs examination and the astronomer has to try to find\nout the causes. Therefore, astronomy follows mechanics and optics, and\nthe latter follow geometry and arithmetic in the order of particular\nto general knowledge. \nBoth approaches are complementary. In the Book of Animals,\nAvempace does not insist on the syllogism as the tool with which\nsciences are built but he points to the elements, principles or\nproblems, employed in the propositions that can be part of any\nsyllogism.  \nAvempace inserted his classification of the sciences into the\nEisagoge, a treatise whose aim is to discover the simple\nuniversal categories underlying the parts of the sentences. His master\nAlfarabi added the chapters on definition, borrowed from the\nAristotelian Analytica Posteriora. Alfarabi had also\nintroduced, at the beginning and in his enumeration of the parts of\nthe sentence, the distinction between “sound”\n(lafẓ) and “meaning”\n(ma‛nà) and said: \nEvery predicate and every subject is either a sound signifying a\nmeaning or a meaning signified by a certain sound, and every meaning\nsignified by a sound is either universal or individual.\n(Eisagoge, Dunlop 1956: 119.1–2) \nAvempace observes that “subject” and\n“predicate” are ambiguous terms because they may refer to\nmeanings as well as to sounds, and what Alfarabi considers in this\nbook are the meanings, not the sounds (IB-taaliq: 30. 6–8).\nAccording to their meaning, both parts of the sentence are either\nuniversal or individual. Avempace then follows Alfarabi and divides\nuniversal parts into simple and composite: simple parts of the\nsentence are genus, species, specific difference, property, and\naccident. Composite parts are the definition, the description, and\n“an expression the composition of which is restricted, and is\nneither a definition nor a description” (IB-taaliq: 30.\n16–17). Avempace’s meaning here can only be understood by\nreading Alfarabi’s Eisagoge.  Alfarabi defined it as an\nexpression which  \nis made up of species and an accident, as when we say of Zayd that he\nis a white man and sometimes it is made up of accidents, as when we\nsay of Zayd that he is an excellent secretary. (Eisagoge,\nDunlop 1956, translation p.\n 137)[11] \nThe nine categories or sorts are parts of the syllogisms (IB-taaliq:\n30. 18–19), according to Avempace and his observations on\n“subject” and “predicate” are linked to the\nsciences which are built on syllogisms. The philosophical sciences,\ndialectic and sophistry, have universal subjects and predicates.\nPoetry and rhetoric have individual subjects and universal predicates.\nRhetoric employs one or more individual subjects as well as predicates\nin cases in which the syllogism resorts to an image or to\n corroboration[12]. \nAvempace knew the difficulties of bringing together the Porphyrian\nEisagoge with the Aristotelian corpus as well as the\nneed to classify and organize the sciences. He did not leave us a\nsystematic treatise, but only wrote comments on Alfarabi’s\nwritings. In spite of it, we can perceive a model that starts with the\ndivision of “meaning” into individual and universal,\ncontinues with the distinction between simple and composite\nuniversals, inserts the doctrine of the categories, moves toward the\nconstruction of syllogisms, and develops into the variety of sciences\naccording to their syllogistic nature or not. Let us deal with the\nplace of the categories. \nThe Oxford manuscript marks a new chapter in the text with the heading\n“Of his discourse at the beginning of the\nEisagoge”. Here Avempace divides “meanings”\ninto two kinds: intelligibles (ma‛qulat) and\nindividuals (IB-taaliq: 42. 7). Intelligibles can exist either in the\nmind or in something outside of it and they are associated mainly with\nthe universals. Avempace quotes Aristotle’s definition of the\nuniversal: “That which is by its nature predicated of more than\none thing” (De interp. 17a 39) but he borrows the\nquotation from Alfarabi who commented on the sentence\n(Eisagoge, Dunlop 1956: 119. 4–13). Avempace has two\ninterpretations for the passage. The first says: “that which is\nby its nature” refers to an actual resemblance so that\nuniversals contain similar individuals “at one and the same\ntime”. By contrast, the second interpretation does not limit the\nuniversals to any moment, and Avempace writes: \n[Aristotle] intended with the expression “that which is by its\nnature” the natural [character of the universal] and its\ndisposition to resemble more than one, which does not imply that the\nresemblance exists in its actualization. For it is not impossible for\nthe eclipse, insofar it is intelligible, to have a resemblance;\nfurther it is not impossible for the eclipse to be predicated of many.\n(IB-taaliq: 46. 4–6) \nThe concepts of possibility and impossibility come into action and the\nuniversal is defined as having the possibility to resemble more than\none, “the possibility inhering in the meaning insofar as it is\nintelligible” (IB-taaliq: 46. 10–11). On the contrary, the\nindividual lacks such possibility; rather, it is impossible for the\nindividual to resemble more than one. \nAny relation, i.e., the Aristotelian category, in order to exist needs\ntwo possibilities, one for each subject of the relation in contrast to\nthe other nine categories, in which one possibility in one subject is\nsufficient. Resemblance is a relation, since it is to be predicated on\ntwo, and both are properties of the classes of intelligibles as well\nas of their individuals. The intelligible relations exist in the\ncategories, not because of their own essence. To sum up, only the\nintelligibles possess the possibility of resembling more than one and\nare predicted to possess many. \nFor Avempace, the main purpose of the Eisagoge is to explain\nthe concepts that underlie the ten Aristotelian categories. The first\ninterpretation of “that which is by its nature” is more\nappropriate to this purpose because the second interpretation affects\nall beings, but the categories do not affect all beings and they deal\nwith existents insofar as the mind acquires them. These concepts are\nof two kinds: simple and composite. The simple ones are the five\nuniversals and the three composite are the definition, the description\nand the aforementioned “restricted composition”. \nAvempace affirms that the five predicables are not primitive concepts,\nbut constitute correlations between two universals falling within the\nrules of individuals and classes. He says: “Genus, species,\nproperty and accident are correlates (iḍafa) which are\ninherent to the intelligibles regarding the quantity of their\nsubjects” (IB-taaliq: 50). Genus, species and property are\nessences inhering in a shared subject; by contrast, the accident is\nnot an essence and exists outside the subject. The specific difference\nis related only to the individual and may be grasped without reference\nto the universal. \nAvempace’s annotations to Alfarabi’s Kitab\nal-Madkhal are more innovative than they might seem at first\nsight. He points out that the Eisagoge should not be limited\nto the exposition of the five “sounds”—maybe six, if\nthe individual is\n added[13]—and\n that a particular science was needed to lay the foundations for the\nOrganon. He conceives this science as a formal theory of\nindividuals and classes that is followed by the theory of definition\nand description. \nAvempace wrote annotations on other logical books of Alfarabi that\nwere edited by M. T. Danishpazhuh (1989) and by Majid Fakhry\n(IB-taaliq), whose edition is complete. New editions are being\nprepared by the Center of Averroic Studies in Fes, Morocco. \nThe five sections of Alfarabi (Farabi 1986: 63–73)\ncontain general indications on how to\nproceed with the study of logic; they are propaedeutic guidelines.\nAvempace feels the need for an explanation why these indications are\ngiven. “Knowledge in any art is conceptualization\n(tasawwur) of the meanings of this art and assent\n(tasdiq) to what is made a concept in it” (IB-taaliq:\n64. 2–3). Once again, he resorts to conceptualization and assent\nas the basic tools of our knowledge. \nIn the first section Alfarabi refers to expressions that have\ndifferent meanings in the colloquial and in the technical language.\nWhen the grammarian hears raf‛, he understands the\nvowel of the nominative case, and not ‘lifting a weight’\nas the unlearned man does. Avempace pays attention to the distinction\nbetween term (sound, lafẓ) and meaning\n(ma‛nà): man listens to a sound, and gets the\nmeaning that he conceptualized. He may have conceptualized a first\nmeaning but he must learn that the term has more than one meaning and\nhow the various meanings are derivate. This learning happens by means\neither of a strong mind or of instruction. \nThe second section classifies knowledge into argumentative and\nintuitive knowledge. The third section deals with the difference\nbetween the essential and the accidental. Avempace reminds his readers\nof the role of conceptualization: learning means to produce a concept\n(tasawwur) out of the meanings and “each concept\nconsists of attributes existing in the object”. The concept aims\nat attributes that exist essentially and discards what is accidental.\nThis section is very useful for conceptualization and assent, because\nonly the essential is taken in the definition (IB-taaliq: 65).  \nThe Alfarabian fourth section describes the various senses of anterior\nand posterior: in time, by nature, in precedence, in excellence, as\ncause to effect. Avempace sees the distinction as the way to\nunderstand equivocity—primary and derivative sense, and focuses\non three senses of anterior and posterior: as cause, in excellence and\nin precedence because the three kinds concern conceptualization and\nassent. Priority in cause means that essential things precede other\nessential things and the concept has to abide by this priority.\nPriority in excellence means that essential is more excellent than\naccidental and the concept has to show it. Priority in cause and in\nexcellence are “degrees” that are applied to the matching\nconcepts in the soul. As for the assent, the distinction helps man to\ngrasp its levels: to apprehend the intelligible, the generally\naccepted, and the simply accepted when the case is required, and not\nin a uniform way. It also helps to memorize because “if matters\nare ordered within the mind, they are easily memorized and\nreminded” (IB-taaliq: 69). \nThe fifth section is the longest and analyses simple and composite\nterms (lafẓ); Alfarabi distinguishes three kinds of\nsimple terms: name (ism), word (kalima), and\ninstrument (adah) which correspond to the grammarians’\ndistinction between name, verb and particle. Avempace justifies the\nsection saying: \nAny learner of a logical art must have an ability to distinguish the\nsigns (dalal) of the terms in order to conceptualize the\nmeanings of this art in his mind; he obtains the meanings from the\nterms pointing to them. (IB-taaliq: 71. 9–11) \nHis idea of science can be defined as obtaining concepts from meanings\nand producing them in his mind, as opposite to memorization. Learning\nby heart all the terms would never be a science and Avempace adds that\nunderstanding “everything written in a book” implies\nunderstanding the meanings of the terms contained in it. The ability\nto discern (mayz) the signs of the terms is the key condition\nto learn any theoretical art. Although the ability exists in most\npeople, the vast majority stifle it from a very young age and Avempace\nblames this behavior as the main cause for the ignorance, and not the\nnatural lack of ability to discern. \nAvempace wrote annotations to Alfarabi’s books on the\nAristotelian Categories, De interpretatione, and to\nthe First and Second Analytics, that were accompanied by\n“exercitations” (irtiyaḍ). His annotation\non the First Analytics contains his views on Aristotle’s purpose\nin introducing the syllogism: \nThe purpose of Aristotle in his book “Analytics” is to\ndiscourse on the syllogistic potency (al-quwa al-qiyasiyya)\nbecause he considered that, if he discoursed on the action of the\nsyllogistic potency, he had to do it on the syllogism, just as when he\ndiscoursed on the natural potency, he had to do it on medicine, that\nis its art. (IB-taaliq: 184. 7–9) \nAvempace explains what he understands under “syllogistic\npotency”: Aristotle sometimes would say that many conclusions\nresult from one syllogism, and sometimes not only one, and this\npossibility is interpreted as “syllogistic potency”.\nAccording to Avempace, when Aristotle argues: Every man is an animal\nand every animal is sensible, thus every man is\n sensible,[14]\n he means that by action of the syllogistic potency the conclusion\n‘a certain animal is a man’ follows from the assertion\n‘every man is an animal’. \nAvempace links the inversion to the introduction of the fourth figure\nof the syllogism in which the middle term is the predicate of the\npremise containing the predicate of the conclusion and the subject of\nthe other premise. “Since [Aristotle] discourses on the action\nof the syllogistic potency, he keeps perceiving the fourth figure that\nGalen thought he had ignored” (IB-taaliq: p. 184.\n20–21). \nThe fourth figure is not rejected by Avempace, who tries to safeguard\nit by using potency in a specific sense, “syllogistic\npotency”. He creates a wider framework in which he places the\n“five sections” while the core belongs to the standard\nsyllogistic doctrine. \nTo this wider framework it belongs Avempace’s use of the\nsyllogism in his book on Coming-to-be and Passing-away. When\nman argues, he accomplishes a kind of mental movement and the movers\nare the premises of the syllogism. Avempace illustrates it with an\nexample: A man takes our money and travels with it towards Cairo. We\ngo after him and we have to stop over in the different places of his\nway up to when we reach the final point, Cairo. Avempace explains us\nthe story: \nSince the existence of the final aim depends on the accomplishment of\na desire, to grasp it is pleasant, and since no other desire\naccompanies it, it is pleasant with such a delight that no pain\ninterferes it, neither essentially nor accidentally. In all\nintermediate degrees there is pleasure and pain, and in the first\ndegree, that is first matter, only pain. That final aim is permanent\npleasure and first matter is permanent pain. The desired thing is the\nfirst mover and the final aim, so that it is both efficient and final\ncause. \nThe arrangement of the premises is similar to that of motion, while\nthe concept (tasawwur) is similar to first matter, and the\nexistence of the final aim is the accomplishment. (IB-taaliq: 35.\n7–36. 3) \nThe reference to the syllogism, its premises and its conclusion is far\ndistant, but the topic how man can attain his perfection, and\ntherefore his happiness is present here as it is in most of\nAvempace’s writings as we will see. \nAl-’Alawi’s exposition of three steps in the intellectual\ndevelopment of Avempace does not conflict with Avempace’s view\nof the sciences. In fact, Alfarabi was active in the three fields in\naddition to the preparatory logic. The first of the three syllogistic\nsciences is mathematics that deals with objects deprived of matter but\nendowed with number and measure. Mathematics contains various\nsciences, among them music and astronomy. \nThe biographical sources are informed by Avempace’s expertise as\na musician and as a composer of muwashshaha poetry. In\naddition, he has left us a brief composition on the\n melodies[15].\n Avempace expounds on the therapeutic effect of playing the\n‛ud, lute, on the basis of universal harmony existing\nbetween the heavenly spheres and the bodily nature, the humors. Each\nchord of the lute is related to one of the four elements: fire, air,\nearth, water, and each chord has a beneficial influence on each\ndisease caused by one of the humors. The chord called zir\nacts on the bile, the chord mathnà on the blood, the\nchord mathlat on the black bile, and the chord bam\non the phlegm. Avempace instructs the player how to place the lute on\nhis body and which finger plays which chord. If the musician plays the\nlute in the right way, his day will be most beautiful. \nIn his letter to Abu Ja‛far Yusuf Ibn Hasday (IB-coll-alawi:\n77–81), Avempace blames the astronomer az-Zarqalluh for not\nhaving properly understood astronomy and attacks him for his\n“Treatise to refute the method employed by Ptolemy to calculate\nthe apogee of Mercury”. This work of az-Zarkalluh is not extant.\nJ. Samsó informs us that Ptolemy’s calculation of the\napogee was wrong by approximately 30º and that az-Zarkalluh\ncalculated the apogee in another work only with an error of 10º\n(Samsó 1993–1994: 676–677). Avempace, however,\ncriticizes the method that az-Zarkalluh employed. \nAvempace wrote a letter to Abu Zayd ‛Abd ar-Rahman Ibn Sayyid\nal-Muhandis (IB-coll-alawi: 84–87) about a preliminary question\nfrom the first book of the Conic Sections of Apollonius of\nPerga (ca. 200 BC). In another letter to his disciple ‛Ali Ibn\nal-Imam (IB-coll-alawi: 88–96) Avempace mentions Ibn Sayyid as\nthe discoverer of new procedures in geometry. In addition to this\nletter, one passage in his Commentary on the\n Physics[16]\n and another in the Book of animals (IB-BA: 74) deal with the\nConic Sections in a sketchy way. Ahmed Djebbar studied Ibn\nSayyid and Avempace and gathered that both Andalusians were innovative\nin their study of warped surfaces resulting from the intersection of\nconic and non-conic\n surfaces[17]. \nAvempace commented very freely on the Aristotelian works and wrote\nindependent articles on various subjects of personal interest. We are\nnot always sure which source he read and whether it was the complete\ntranslation or an abridgment. In the case of his commentary on the\n Meteorology,[18]\n we know from Paul Lettinck’s edition and translation of the\ncommentary. Lettinck proved that Avempace read the altered version of\nthe Meteorology made by Yahyà Ibn al-Bitriq (d. ca.\n830; Petraitis 1967). \nThe Aristotelian treatises dealing mainly with natural philosophy are\nthe Physics, Coming-to-be and Passing-away, On\nthe Heavens, and Meteorology. This is the traditional\norder of their arrangement within the corpus, and the books\non the Animals are last. Avempace followed the order for his\nreading of the corpus, wrote his commentaries accordingly and\ntherefore we should first consider his commentary on the\n Physics.[19] \nAvempace defines this science as theoretical, the subject of which is\nthe natural body and says that most of its subject is known by the\nsenses (IB-SS-fakhry: 15.7–9). Physics works on the basis of\nprinciples insofar as it is theoretical and searches for causes as its\ndemonstrative science. We should not leave aside the long discussion\non the essence and position of physics in Avempace’s\nintroduction to his Book of Animals. \nThere we learned that the matter of physics is strenuous.  \nThis science must employ all the potencies [capacities] developed\npreviously in mathematics and logical and it employs them only insofar\nthey belong to a common genus. (IB-BA: 69. 5–7)  \nAvempace finally affirms that natural science has various kinds of\nprinciples and problems, and that it contains objects that are not\nsensible at all, like the intellect. \nAvempace makes clear that natural science or physics is a theoretical\nscience which requires mastering other sciences. It is not a science\nlike geometry the objects of which are anterior, both in knowledge and\nin reality. Its objects are posterior in knowledge, but Avempace\nremarks that some are not related to the senses. \nMotion is one of the main issues in the Physics and Avempace\nhad original views on the issue. Book VII of the Aristotelian\nPhysics does not fit into the sequence of Books V, VI and\nVIII and its chapters deal with subjects not related to each other.\nOne of them mentions that every movable or mobile is moved by a mover\ndifferent from itself (Phys. VII.1, 241b 24). Avempace\nconsiders the tenet that everything is moved by something else, and\nsays: \nIt is evident that the rest of the whole caused by the rest of one of\nits parts takes place in so far as the movable is other than the\nmover, and when the influence (athar) of the latter ends, it\ncomes to rest. Its influence ends because the mover ceases to act\neither on its own or because something else exerts resistance on it.\nWhenever the mover ceases to act on its own, this happens due either\nto its destruction, or to exhaustion (kalal) of the power of\nthe mover, or because the cause disappears, or because the motion is\ncomplete, since the movable has reached the end toward which it was\nmoving. (IB-SS-fakhry: 99.16–20. Lettinck 1994:\n532–533) \n“Influence” is not a technical term, but the words\nfollowing the quoted text clarify it. Motion necessarily takes place\nif a moving power exists in such a condition that enables it to cause\nmotion and if no contrary moving power exerts resistance. If the\nmoving power ceases, its influence does too. \nThe movements involved here are so-called “violent”\nmovements, as opposed to “natural” ones discussed below.\nIbn Bâjja sketches a theory of dynamics based on a notion of\n“power” different from the Aristotelian notion of\ndynamis: they are mechanical forces which can join another\nforce or counteract it by offering resistance. Shlomoh Pines\nintroduced the term\n “dynamics”[20]\n to define his views, which no doubt were influenced by the tradition\nlinked to John Philoponus (d. ca.\n 566).[21]\n There is a minimum amount of moving power for each movable. For\ninstance, to move a boat a minimum of power is needed, otherwise\n“one grain of sand could move the boat” (IB-SS-fakhry:\n112.27). \nWhen two opposing powers are equal, there is no motion, and when one\npower “overcomes” the other, the body moves until it\nsuffers “exhaustion” (kalal), because any body\nmoved “violently” creates a contrary power stronger than\nthe one imposed by the mover, and also because the imposed force\nbecomes “exhausted”. The moving power is also subject to\ntime and distance factors and the mobile can offer almost no\nresistance, so that the absolute terms of proportionality do not\napply. \nAnother contribution is related to motion in the void. Avempace\nanalyzes “natural” movements such as a stone’s\nfalling through air and water. They are the movements of the four\nelemental bodies: fire, air, water and earth. These movables need a\nmoving power capable not only of moving them, but also of displacing\nthe medium through which they pass. Dust particles stay suspended in\nthe air because, although they possess enough power to go down, their\npower is insufficient to displace the air. \nAristotle rejected the possibility of motion in the void because the\nmedium was essential to natural movement at finite speed\n(Phys. IV.8). John Philoponus had already expressed the view\nthat the medium is not a necessary condition, but only provides\nresistance. The different velocities with which the stone passes\nthrough the air or the water is only caused by the different density\nof the medium; it is not connatural to the medium. As a proof that\nmotion without any medium, namely, through a void, is possible,\nAvempace adduces the movement of the spheres: \n[In the heavens] there are no elements of violent motion, because\nnothing bends their movement, the place of the sphere remains the same\nand no new place is taken by it. Therefore, circular movement should\nbe instantaneous, but we observe that some spheres move\nslowly—such as the sphere of fixed stars—and others\nfast—the daily movement—and that there is neither violence\nnor resistance among them. The cause for the different velocities is\nthe difference in nobility (sharf) between mover and movable.\n(IB-SS-fakhry: 116.13–17) \nThe role of the medium is not essential, but is only a kind of\nresistance, and thus motion in the void is both theoretically possible\nand confirmed by the observation of the spheres. Avempace contradicts\nAristotle and advances a doctrine that Galileo will later prove to be\n right.[22]\n The similarity with Philoponus’ doctrine is clear, but an\ninfluence is not certain (Lettinck 1994: 549). \nThe treatise On the Heavens followed next in the Aristotelian\norder but no commentary of Avempace has reached us, and the following\nextant commentary is on Coming-to-be and Passing-away\n(IB-GC). Avempace coincided with Philoponus in a preliminary remark\nobserving that Aristotle proved in his book On the Heavens\nthe existence of four elementary bodies: fire, air, water, earth.\nSince one of the subjects of Coming-to-be and Passing-away is\nthe mutual generation of these bodies, it is the logical continuation.\nThus, Avempace’s lost commentary On the Heavens likely\ncomes after the one on Physics and before the one on\nComing-to-be and Passing-away. \nThis commentary runs parallel to the Aristotelian text. After\nexplaining changes in quality, Avempace suddenly starts a discourse on\nforce or power (quwwa) and on the moving power (quwwa\nmuharrika; IB-GC: 26–40). The four elementary bodies are\ndefined by the four possible binary combinations of cold/warm with\nheavy/light. Some of them can be also moving powers: \nIf the causes of the qualities exist primarily in their subjects and\nbelong to the same species, the qualities are movers […]\nAbsolute actuality is the existence of this moving power as moving and\nthis is only the case because of the existence of the movable being in\nmotion, and this is coherent if we assume the movable power to exist.\n(IB-GC: 26. 1–7) \nFor Wirmer the passage is one of the pillars, on which he develops the\nmetaphysical doctrine of “Potenz” in Avempace (Wirmer\n2014: 346–352). Avempace does not extend in the issue of\nelementary qualities as moving powers, and focuses on the soul as a\nmoving power (elemental bodies do not have souls; instead, they have\nnatures). The case of the human soul interests him most and he wants\nto explain how intellectual apprehension moves man in reasoning and\naction. Avempace will deal, in a more satisfactory way, with the issue\nof rank of ideas and forms in relation to human activity in other\nworks. \nAvempace’s reflections on absolute coming-to-be and passing-away\nstart with a linguistic analysis of the term kawn\n“coming-to-be” which echoes Alfarabi’s method and\nitself is a novelty (IB-GC: 41–44). Avempace stresses that\ncoming-to-be is only possible if the metaphysical structure of act and\npotency are admitted (IB-GC: 46–47). \nAt the beginning of his treatise of Meteorology, Aristotle\nsummarizes his preceding research: he has established the four causes\nof nature and dealt with all natural motion in Physics. He\nhas investigated the ordered movement of the stars in the heavens in\nDe caelo, and changes of the four elements into one another,\ngrowth, and perishing in De generatione et corruptione. What\nstill has to be investigated is that which takes place “in the\nregion nearest to the motion of the stars such as the Milky Way”\n(Meteo. 338b 3–4). \nAvempace’s commentary presents his own theory of the Milky Way.\nAristotle explained it as the ignition of the fiery exhalation of some\nstars which were large, numerous and close together. The ignition\ntakes place in the upper part of the atmosphere, in the region of the\nworld which is continuous with the heavenly motions (Meteo.\n346b 11–12). The version transmitted by Ibn al-Bitriq diverges\nand considers the Milky Way to be a phenomenon exclusively of the\nheavenly spheres, not of the upper part of the atmosphere. The light\nof those stars makes a visible patch because they are so close. \nAvempace considers the Milky Way to be a phenomenon both of the\nspheres above the moon and of the sublunar region. The Milky Way is\nthe light of many stars which almost touch one another. Their light\nforms a “continuous image” (khayal muttasil) on\nthe surface of the body which is like a “tent”\n(takhawwum) under the fierily element and over the air which\nit\n covers.[23]\n Avempace defines the continuous image as the result of refraction\n(in‛ikas) and supports its explanation with an\nobservation of a conjunction of two planets, Jupiter and Mars which\ntook place in 500/1106–7. He watched the conjunction and\n“saw them having an elongate figure” (Lettinck 1999: 434)\nalthough their figure is circular. \nAvempace wrote a treatise on animals related to the Aristotelian books\nGeneration of Animals, Parts of the animals, and\nDescription of the animals, and another one on plants\n(Asín Palacios 1940) and probably a third one on minerals, all\nfollowing the Pseudo-Aristotelian\n corpus.[24] \nThe Book of Animals was edited by Jawad al-‛Imarati\n(IB-BA). As said above, Avempace begins his book situating it in the\ncontext of the theoretical sciences, and then within natural science.\nThe science of the living animals is a species of the natural\nphilosophy (IB-BA: 71). Avempace wonders whether the relationship of\nits subject, the animal, is similar to the relationship of arithmetic\nto numbers. Arithmetic is a discipline where the pattern of genus and\nspecies applies smoothly: It establishes ten units, and then it\ncombines them and gives them accidents like being odd or a pair, etc.\nSince numbers are made one of another “ten is made of the five\nmultiplied by the two” and they are “simple forms”\nwhich can be continuously incremented (IB-BA: 73) and animals have a\ncompletely different existence, Avempace denies the relationship.  \nGeometrical objects are similar to numbers, but they differ insofar as\ntheir species are infinite. Avempace mentions infinite figures\n“resulting from [intersecting] the straight line with the\ncircle, either cylinder or conic”. Primary genera of geometry\nare the line, the surface and the body, and Avempace denies any\nparallelism to the swimming, walking and flying characteristics of\nanimals—he uses the term tanasub,\n‘proportional’, opposite to tawatu’,\n‘univocal’ (IB-BA: 74. 16–20).  \nAs for a possible similarity to the numbers, numerical specific\ndifferences are anterior and actively dividing, not divisible. On the\ncontrary, according to Avempace, the science of the animals goes\nanother way:  \nWe must take the first contrariety inherent to the animals and by\nwhich they are divisible, and whether it belongs to the essential\nuniversal opposite accidents by which the primary species come to\nstand. (IB-BA: 75. 1–3)  \nAvempace inquiries further about these basic contrarieties to\nestablish the furthermost species and make possible a demonstrative\nscience.  \nWe predicate of the animals contrary specific differences, like having\nblood or not, and then we can prove it. If we talk about man and about\nbull, we cannot make any specific distinction. (IB-BA: 76.\n7–9) \nAristotle, according to Avempace, classified the science of animals\ninto four sections: 1) properties of the sensible parts of animals, 2)\nproperties of their limbs, 3) properties of their homogeneous sensible\nparts, and 4) properties of their non-homogeneous sensible parts\n(IB-BA: 76). \nIf we go into the material content of the book, we find some\nremarkable contributions of Avempace. Remke Kruk points to his\ndescription of the copulation of insects and to the male and female\nrole in the procreative process (Kruk 1997: 172–175). \nHowever, the theoretic endeavor of Avempace in his Book of\nanimals seems to be more relevant. Avempace wants to draw a\ntheoretic system embracing all reality. Reality is plenty of forms,\nand their perfection consists of motion and action (IB-BA: 79). He\ndivides forms into natural and artificial. The specific difference is\nthat natural forms possess a power (quwwa) which moves bodies\nand by which bodies move themselves while artifacts only move\naccidentally). \nArt (sina‛a) is the elaborated form abstracted from\nmatter; it is abstracted from its matter. The artificial form which\nexists in its matter does not have any power to move that which is in\nit nor to move something else. This is the difference between\nartificial and natural forms. (IB-BA: 79. 1–4) \nNatural powers are obviously nobler than artificial ones. Avempace\nalso takes modal factors into account for his design and introduces\nnecessity in his discourse. Necessity is predicated of immovable forms\nin its primary sense, and metaphysics deals with them. The natural\nscientist deals with forms subject to motion and, for this reason,\nnecessity can be predicated “by design”\nbi-l-wad‛. Avempace gives the following example that\nclarifies what he means with “by design”: \nIf there is a house, there is a foundation by necessity, and this kind\nof necessity is a relationship between the causes of the existing\n[object] and the final [cause]. If [the final cause] is described, the\nvarious kinds of the causes follow it by necessity, and the form acts\nin a similar way. \nIf the form is the final [cause] of a motion, motion follows it by\nnecessity, and it is something evident because, if there is building\nactivity, there will be a house, and if there is building, there is\nthe art of construction, but if there is only the art of construction,\nthere will be no building. If [form] is acquired ‘by\ndesign,’ the other causes result in an orderly way from the\nfinal cause by necessity. (IB-BA: 81. 6–10) \n‘Design’ is the human involvement in the example. In\nnatural philosophy, necessity can be predicated also in another sense.\nAvempace mentions the case of the carpenter who choses an iron hatchet\nbecause of the hardness of its iron; the hatchet as formal cause\ncannot carry its function unless its matter is iron or an alike\nmaterial. He sees here another kind of necessity, intrinsec necessity\nbecause of matter. Following the example, iron melts by the\napplication of fire or it rusts in the soil. Melting and rusting take\nplace by necessity and “not because the smith intends it”\n(IB-BA: 81. 16). \nBy contrast absolute necessity reigns in the heavenly spheres,\nTherefore, Avempace reckons three kinds of necessity: absolute,\n“by design”, and material. Interestingly, Avempace turns\nnow to the moon eclipses: they happen with absolute necessity in a\ndetermined period of time (IB-BA: 82). As he goes on and discusses\npossibility, Avempace admits possibility in relation to the eclipses,\nbut combined with necessity—he litterally says that\n“possibility shares necessity”. Possibility is present\ninsofar as no specific limits determine the periods of time in which\nthe eclipse exists potentially from those in which it exists actually.\nNecessity shows when it does not exist in a given time because of\nopposed motions caused by opposed unmoved movers. \nAvempace considers then the four elements, in which necessity is only\nexistent because the temporal determination. Avempace’s lengthy\nand twisted arguments end with the conclusion:  Since the celestial bodies do not have any contrary form, there is\nabsolutely no potentiality (quwwa), and if there is no\npossibility (imkan) in them, there is no coming-to-be nor\npassing-away. (IB-BA: 83. 13–16) \nAs Avempace’s natural philosophy goes beyond the analysis of\nmotion, matter, time and place, it extends to metaphysical principles\nof necessity and possibility which eventually concern human\nbehavor. \nWe have read above that physics aims not only at sensible objects\n(above,), but also spiritual ones—which allows us to\nintroduce Avempace’s book on the Soul. The book was\nedited (IB-S1a) and translated by Muhammad Saghir Hasan\nal-Ma‛sumi (IB-S1e) who unfortunately could use only the Oxford\nmanuscript; the Berlin manuscript is longer although its composition\nis less coherent. In 2007 J. Lomba Fuentes used both manuscripts for\nhis Spanish translation (IB-S-lomba) as D. Wirmer has done for his\nGerman version (IB-S-wirmer). \nWhen Avempace starts the book, he proceeds in a similar way to the one\non animals, namely with a comprehensive framing of the subject. Bodies\nare either natural or artificial; all they have in common the presence\nof matter and form; and form is their perfection. Natural bodies have\ntheir mover inside the whole body, because the natural body is\ncomposed of mover and moved. \nMost of the artificial bodies are moved by an external mover, although\nautomats or machines have their motor inside, and Avempace adds\n“I have explained it in the science of Politics”\n(which is lost) (IB-S1a: 25. 4; IB-S1e: 15). The mover is identical\nwith the form. He distinguishes two kinds of perfecting forms, namely\nforms moving by means of an instrument or not (IB-S1a: 28; IB-S1e:\n17). The first kind is nature, the second, the soul. \nTo define the soul as operating through an instrument, i.e., the body\n“in an ambiguous sense”, as Avempace does (IB-S1a: 29. 2),\nimplies it is autonomous. Avempace defines the soul also as first\nentelechy (istikmal), as opposed to the last entelechy of the\ngeometer, i.e., its being geometer in act. Soul appears as an\nincorporeal substance, of highest rank. The science of soul is\nconsidered by Avempace as superior to physics and mathematics, only\ninferior to metaphysics. Avempace is not disturbed by\nAristotle’s hylemorphic view of the soul which he may have\nknown. He affirms that all philosophers agreed that the soul is a\nsubstance and portrays Plato as the adequate source: \nSince it was clear to Plato that the soul is assigned to substance,\nand that substance is predicated on the form and matter which is body,\nand that the soul cannot be said to be a body, he fervently defined\nthe soul in its particular aspect. Since he had established that the\nforms of spheres are souls, he looked for the commonality of all\n[souls], and found that sense perception is particular to animals,\n[but] that movement is particular to all, and therefore he defined the\nsoul as “something which moves itself”. (IB-S1a: 40.\n5–41; IB-S1e: 26) \nAristotle’s treatise is relevant for Avempace in its description\nof the various powers of the soul, i.e., nutritive, sense-perceptive,\nimaginative, rational faculties, although Avempace may have not had\nany Arabic translation of Aristotle’s De\n anima.[25]\n Avempace often digresses into general reflections; for instance, at\nthe beginning of his chapter on the nutritive faculty he talks about\npossibility and impossibility. But, in other places, there are some\nreferences to Aristotle, for instance, when it comes to the\nimaginative faculty. Avempace writes that “The imaginative\nfaculty is the faculty by which the “reasons”\n(ma‛ani) of the sensibles are apprehended”\n(IB-S1a: 133. 3; IB-S1e: 106). \nMa‛nà can translate various Greek words, and the\nStoic lektón “meaning” is the most\nrelevant. The Arab grammarians used the term\nma‛nà, plural ma‛ani to point to\nthe content of the word, to its semantic component, in contrast to\nlafẓ, its phonic part; the pair ma‛nà\n/ lafẓ is already found in Sibawayhi (d. ca. 796).\nMa‛nà was frequently used by Islamic theologians\ntoo, to express the concrete cause or “reason” of a thing.\nThe Latin intentio of medieval philosophy is used to\ntranslate ma‛nà, and the concept of\nintentio appears close to that intended by Avempace since\nma‛nà has two characteristics: it is some form\nor figure dissociated from matter but having reference to the thing\nthe figure of form of which it is (Blaustein 1986: 207).  \nImagination apprehends the internal contents of the sensations and\nanimals operate with them. “It is the most noble faculty in\nirrational animals, and through it animals move, have many arts, and\nlook after their progeny”. Avempace gives as examples ants and\nbees, which are exactly the kind of animals to which Aristotle denies\nthe faculty! (IB-S1a: 140; IB-S1e: 111). \nAvempace begins his chapter on the rational faculty by asking whether\nthis faculty is always actual or sometimes potential and actual. He\nanswers that it is sometimes potential and sometimes actual (IB-S1a:\n145–146; IB-S1e: 117–118). It is just a note without\ncontinuation. \nThe main activity of the reasoning faculty is to enquire and to learn.\nAvempace introduces here the discursive faculty (al-quwa\nal-mufakkira) which binds subject and predicate. The text is\nconfusing and the Oxford manuscript ends inconclusively. The\nBerlin-Krakow manuscript has a few more\npages (176rº–179rº) that Joaquín Lomba included in his\nSpanish translation. At the end of the fragment, the\nunknown editor writes that it is a treatise on intellect and is a\ncontinuation of Avempace’s discourse on the soul. \nThe intellect, Avempace affirms, apprehends the essence of something,\nnot something material and individual. The essence of any object is\nits “reason” (ma‛nà) which\ncorresponds to its form linked to matter in this case. If we go back\nto a former passage of the same book, we read how the distinction\nis: \nThe difference between the reason and form is that form and matter\nbecome one thing without existing separately, whereas the reason of\nthe thing perceived is a form separated from matter. So the reason is\nthe form separated from matter. (IB-S1a: 94. 11–13) \nThen the intellect apprehends it in such a way that they\nboth—essence and intellect—are “one in the subject\nand two in expression”. The speculative intellect searches for\nthe essences of material beings, but it is not satisfied with their\napprehension. It realizes that they are material intelligibles which\nneed further foundation and Avempace contends that the intellect knows\nthat there are superior intelligibles which found them and strives for\nthem (Mss. Berlin 176 vº). The fragment contains these and other\nnotes which are difficult to bring together although they are in\nharmony with other writings of Avempace. We may refer to his\nexposition of the “spiritual forms” in the Rule of the\nSolitary as more relevant. \nFinally, we should mention his text in defense of Alfarabi, accused of\ndenying survival after\n death.[26]\n There, Avempace argues that since man has knowledge of intelligibles\nbeyond sense-perception and since it occurs by means of introspection,\nit is a divine gift to man who has no need for the matter to survive\nafter death. \nAvempace illustrated for us his views on how knowledge is organized\nand how the world of nature is structured, but we have not yet\nexpounded on his proper ideas on metaphysics, nor on the sciences that\naim at beings produced by the human will and choice, namely, ethics\nand politics. \nAvempace’s most representative works are the Rule of the\n Solitary,[27]\n the epistle of the Farewell\n Message,[28]\n and the Epistle of Conjunction of Intellect with\n Man.[29]\n The latter work contains references to Rule of the Solitary\nand to the epistle of the Farewell Message (as well as to his\nbook on the Soul). \nAlfarabi’s major work is Book of the opinions of the\ninhabitants of the righteous\n city[30].\n It is an exposition of a Neo-Platonist emanationist system as well of\nthe different kinds of societies. Alfarabi wanted a perfect city,\nruled by a righteous man parallel to the rule of the universe by the\nperfect One. His connecting cosmogenic explanations and political\nplans were known to Avempace who did not follow him. Avempace does not\nquote this or other works by Alfarabi which have a similar content. He\nquotes Plato but follows the opposite way. While Plato in the\nRepublic would take the human soul as the model for the\nperfect city, so that the perfect organization inside it tells how the\ncity has to be organized, Avempace starts from the ideal city and\nwants to transfer its organization to the individual (Abbès\n2011: 86). \nAvempace echoes Plato and mentions his division of cities, or\nsocieties, into a perfect one and others which are corrupted\n(IB-RS-AP: 5–6; IB-coll-genequand: 123; IB-RS-berman: 125). One\nassumes that Avempace is referring to the four imperfect cities,\nnamely, timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, and tyranny\n(Republic, viii-ix) although Asín Palacios interpreted\nthem as the four imperfect cities cited in Alfarabi’s works\n(IB-RS-AP: 37, note 6), and Genequand accepts both possibilities\n(IB-coll-genequand: 256 §13) \nThe virtuous city is the only that can make its inhabitants happy\nbecause they achieve their perfection. It is characterized by the\nabsence of the art of medicine and the art of adjudication. Avempace\nfollows Plato, but his version is also characterized by the absence of\nweeds (IB-RS-AP: 10. 16–18; IB-RS-berman: 126;\nIB-coll-genequand: 126 §32). Avempace explains that in imperfect\ncities there are false opinions, but that the majority of inhabitants\naccept them as right, or that there are contradictory positions and\nthat there is no way to know which one is true. \nNow the people who discover a right action or learn a true science\nthat does not exist in the city belong to a class that has no generic\nname. As for the ones who stumble upon a true opinion that does not\nexist in the city or the opposite of which is believed in the city,\nthey are called weeds. (IB-RS-AP: 10. 8–11; IB-coll-genequand:\n126, §31; IB-RS-berman: 127) \nE.I.J. Rosenthal already pointed to the different evaluation of the\n“weeds” by Alfarabi and Avempace (Rosenthal 1951).\nAvempace borrows the concept from Alfarabi who saw these men as a\ndanger in the imperfect as well as the perfect city. Avempace saw the\nvirtuous city free of weeds, because it is free from false opinions.\nWeed-men spring up only in the imperfect cities, and they can help in\ncorrecting their views. However, he realized that they were strangers\nin the cities or societies of his time, which all belonged to the\ncorrupted types, and he did not believe that these societies could be\nrehabilitated; he abandoned Alfarabi at this point and addressed the\n“weed-men”. \nAvempace wrote a book of a genre similar to that which physicians\nwrite to preserve and acquire health, the so called tadbir\nas-sihha. He referred to Galen and what Galen wrote in the\nPreservation of Health as a model for his Rule of the\nSolitary. To preserve physical health requires knowledge of the\nnatural science about delivering justice, for example, and knowledge\nof political science. Avempace concluded that since his treatise aims\nat acquiring and preserving spiritual health, “it reverts to the\nnatural and political science” (IB-RS-AP: 12.15–16;\nIB-RS-berman: 129; IB-coll-genequand: 128 §38). What binds\nnatural and political science? Forms, insofar as men have similar and\ndifferent forms, and forms are related to nature. \n“Form” acquires a broad sense for Avempace who\ndistinguishes various kinds of it. Forms are known as the intelligible\nessences of objects. Avempace accepts this meaning. For him, however,\nforms have something in common, namely, moving power, and forms are\nintegrated into a participating hierarchy. Avempace’s doctrine\nof the forms is no doubt original, although antecedents are found in\nthe Neo-Platonist tradition. He once quotes a treatise “On the\nSpiritual Forms” misattributed to Alexander of Aphrodisias\n(IB-coll-fakhry: 166. 16–17; IB-CIM: 18) which S. Pines (1955)\ndemonstrated to belong to Proclus. Alfarabi’s Risala fi\nl-‛aql (1938) and other of his works contain the principles\nof the participating hierarchy of intellects and intelligibles (cf.\nDavidson 1992; Ramón Guerrero 1992). \nThus, man’s actions belong to different levels according to the\ndifferent forms found in man: physical, animal and spiritual. The\nlatter are specific to man; we can know which actions are most\nappropriate to man only if we know what is his essence, namely, his\nmost excellent form. Therefore, Avempace accompanies his Regimen\nsanitatis with a following Treatise on the spiritual\nforms, lengthier than the former. Steven Harvey already insisted\nthat his epistemology allows us to understand his attitude about\npolitics, and that is not something accidental (Harvey 1992: 212).\nAvempace assigns the term “spiritual” to the soul insofar\nas it is “a moving soul”. This may be too broad a\ndefinition, but he then specifies the various kinds of\n“spiritual forms”—all having the capacity to\nmove: \nThe spiritual forms are of various kinds: the first are the forms of\nthe circular [i.e., heavenly] bodies, the second are the active\nintellect and the acquired intellect, the third are the material\nintelligibles (ma‛qulat), the fourth are the\n“reasons” (ma‛ani) existent in the\nfaculties of the soul, i.e., existent in common sense, in the\nimaginative faculty and in the memory. (IB-RS-AP: 19.2–5;\nIB-coll-fakhry: 49.16–19; IB-coll-genequand: 132 §58) \nThe heavenly bodies are not only immaterial for Avempace and the long\nAristotelian tradition, but they are also the most spiritual and are\nfollowed in rank by the class of the active intellect and the acquired\nintellect. The active intellect is immaterial, but the acquired\nintellect has some connection to matter “because it perfects\n(mutammim) the material intelligibles” (IB-RS-AP: 19.\n10; IB-coll-genequand: 133 §59: “il\nactualize”). The latter are “not spiritual per\nse because their existence takes place in prime matter”\n(IB-RS-AP: 19. 7–8; IB-coll-genequand: 132 §59), and we\nassume that they are the internal counterpart of the substantial\nforms. We see that spiritual forms differ from similar forms which are\njoined to matter and determine the substances. \nAvempace does not give us any instance of “material\nintelligibles”, but we may well think of the idea of a tree or a\nhorse in our mind. In his later treatise on the Conjunction of\nIntellect with Man, Avempace differentiates between intelligibles\nof real existing beings such as the horse, and intelligibles of\nnon-existent beings, such as a one-legged man, and he further\ndifferentiates between intelligibles of real existing beings which one\nhas seen, and intelligibles of existing being which one has not seen.\nFor Avempace, the latter are intelligibles in a derivative sense or by\nanalogy (IB-CIM: 15; IB-coll-fakhry: 163; IB-coll-genequand: 191\n§27). “Material intelligibles” should contain both\ncategories. \nThe objects of common sense, imagination, and of memory are not\nintelligibles; they are ma‘ani, “reasons”.\nThe term is ambiguous, but it is clear that a “reason” is\nthe cognitive product of any of these three faculties and it is also\nclear that “reason” is some spiritual form. \nAccording to Avempace, spiritual forms divide into universal and\nparticular forms: universal forms are found in the active intellect\nand the individual intellect apprehends them too. Particular forms are\nfound in common sense, and Avempace gives the instance of a certain\nmount in Arabia. The “spiritual” content of the forms in\nthe common sense is lower than in the forms of the imagination, and\nthat of the latter ones is lower than in the forms of the memory\ninsofar as their content is more and more “corporeal”. The\nforms of the rational faculty—we may say, the material\nintelligibles—are not corporeal (IB-RS-AP: 21. 2–3;\nIB-coll-fakhry: 50; IB-coll-genequand: 132 §61). Avempace seems\nto be aware of the difficulties of his explanation, and later on the\nsame treatise he summarizes the views: \nWe say: The form of any generated corruptible being has three grades\nof existence, the first is that of the universal spiritual form which\nis the intelligible form and is the species, the second is that of the\nparticular spiritual form, and the third that of bodily form. \nThe particular spiritual form has again three grades, the first is\nthat of the “reason” existing in the memory, the second is\nthat of the picture (rasm) existing in the imaginative\nfaculty, and the third is the image (sanam) or the common\nsense. (IB-RS-AP: 31.13–32.1; IB-coll-fakhry: 58.10–15;\nIB-coll-genequand: 141–142, §90) \nParticular spiritual forms may be true or false; if they have come to\nus through the common sense, they are mostly true. Spiritual forms\nplay a role in every aspect of human life, even in the prophetic\nrevelation. The inspiration received by the prophets belongs to the\ncategory of particular spiritual forms, which do not pass through the\ncommon sense, but are received directly from the active intellect.\nAvempace wrongly refers to Aristotle in support of his view and view\nand ends by saying “These instances go beyond the natural world,\nthey are divine gifts” (IB-RS-AP: 24. 7; IB-coll-fakhry: 53;\nIB-coll-genequand: 136 §71). \nAs for the Sufis, their experiences belong to the level of the\nparticular spiritual forms, where common sense, imagination and memory\nare active, but they mistake them for universal spiritual forms, and\nwrongly believe that the coincidence of the three faculties is the\nsource of supreme happiness (IB-RS-AP: 26–27; IB-coll-fakhry:\n55). \nMan has to organize his various faculties—from the rational to\nthe nutritive—and there are categories of men according to the\nprevalence of each of the three faculties. In some of them,\ncorporeality prevails; in a select few, spirituality does. Ibn\nBâjja counts some ascetics and Sufis among the latter—but\nfor most, the situation is mixed. Man is moved by spiritual forms that\nmay be as basic as clothing, housing or food. Clothing, for instance,\nacts on two levels, the protective and the ornamental. Virtues are\nattached to the spiritual forms found in the imaginative faculty\nbecause the purpose of virtuous actions is generating positive\nfeelings and admiration in the souls of those who see them. The\nspirituality of most men is, however, limited to particular forms.\nOnly philosophers attain the highest degree of spirituality, the\nimmaterial and universal intelligibles. Although philosophers have to\ntake due care of the corporeal and particular spiritual forms in order\nto live, and live honorably, their main concern is the universal\nseparated forms: \nSpiritual acts render him nobler, and the intellectual acts render him\ndivine and virtuous. The man of wisdom is therefore necessarily a man\nwho is virtuous and divine. Of every kind of activity, he takes up the\nbest only. He shares with every class of men the best states that\ncharacterize them. But he stands alone as the one who performs the\nmost excellent and the noblest of actions. When he achieves the\nhighest end—that is, when he apprehends simple substantial\nintelligences (‛uqul) that are mentioned in the\n[Aristotelian] Metaphysics, the book On the Soul,\nand On Sense and the Sensible—he then becomes one of\nthese intelligences. It would be right to call him simply divine, and\nhe will be free from the mortal sensible qualities, as well from the\n[particular] spiritual qualities. (IB-RS-AP: 61.11–18;\nIB-coll-fakhry: 77; IB-RS-berman: 131–132; IB-coll-genequand:\n163–164, §164–165) \nIn his later treatise Conjunction of Intellect with Man,\nAvempace reformulated his theory. He addressed the treatise to his\ndisciple Ibn al-Imam and complained about lack of time because of his\nnumerous occupations. For this reason he chose a non technical way to\ndescribe how man first acquires the spiritual forms, then he\napprehends the intelligibles, and by means of the latter he approaches\nthe final intelligence, whose intelligible is itself. He calls it the\nnatural way: each man has a material intellect which receives them and\nthe intelligibles are relative to each material intellect (IB-CIM: 17;\nIB-coll-fakhry: 164; IB-coll-genequand: 193 §32). \nHe distinguished three stages, the first is that of the common people\nand their intelligibles are linked to the material objects; the second\nis that of the natural scientists or philosophers, and their\nintelligibles are linked to the spiritual forms.  \nAvempace is not satisfied with an indirect approach to the last\nintelligence and wants to reach and acquire the absolute\nintelligibles, free of any relation to the material intellects and\nfree of any spiritual form (particular or universal): it is the third\nand final stage.  \nWe are informed that absolute intelligibles are the true existence and\nthat they merge into the one last intelligence. Avempace never says\nthat God is the last intelligence, which he compares with the sun and\nits light. The felicitous person who succeeds in reaching the highest\nstep of knowledge becomes light himself (IB-CIM: 19; IB-coll-fakhry:\n168; IB-coll-genequand: 198 §46). But, in this stage, he abandons\nany articulated scientific knowledge and dips into a wordless mystical\nexperience. \nBy contrast, practical intelligibles play a minor role in spite of the\nimport they have in ethics and politics. Avempace includes among them\nthe ruling of the city or of the armies and considers them\n“intermediate forms”. They exist in the solitary only for\nthe sake of one of the three spiritual forms, corporeal, particular\nspiritual and universal spiritual (IB-coll-fakhry: 91;\nIB-coll-genequand: 179 §210). \nAs we said above, Avempace presented his Rule of the Solitary\n(Tadbir al-mutawahhid) as a Regimen sanitatis in\norder to acquire and preserve spiritual health, which obviously equals\nto happiness (IB-RS-AP: 11; IB-coll-fakhry: 43; IB-RS-berman: 128).\nThe companion he gave to Ibn al-Imam for his travel, the Epistle\nof Farewell, was intended to help him attain spiritual happiness.\nAvempace enumerates the different degrees of pleasure, the highest\nbeing science. Man suffers from ignorance and when he reaches the\ntruth, pain goes away and pleasure seizes him. However, intellectual\npleasure is also caused by the very fact of knowing. \nBut when we strive for knowledge, we do it not because of pleasure but\npleasure is some profit (ribh) we gain as it follows the\nexistence of the truth, because every pleasure is like the shadow of\nsomething else. (IB-CIM: 23. 5–7; IB-coll-fakhry: 123.\n2–4; IB-coll-genequand: 98 §29) \nAvempace enquires further on the issue of pleasure and knowledge, and\nwe can abbreviate it by saying that the highest form of pleasure\nrequires continuity and that continuous pleasure is attained not only\nby intellectual knowledge but also by knowledge of an eternal object.\nMetaphysical knowledge is man’s uppermost stage and source of\nhighest pleasure. Averroes (d. 1198), however, would express doubts\nwhether man’s uppermost stage is a natural perfection or divine\ngift for Avempace, an issue which Alexander Altmann researched (1965).\nAltmann concluded that Avempace defended the uppermost stage as a\nmystical experience, similar to that preached by the Sufis, and in any\ncase we can agree that Avempace saw the uppermost stage as a divine\ngift. \nAvempace concluded his enquiry moving out of the rational and leaving\nmany loose ends. He was a busy man. When he finished his treatise\nOn the Conjunction of Man with Intellect he apologized for\nnot having been able to produce a demonstrative argument,\nburhan, on the issue and uttered his hope that the addressee\nof the epistle would be able to grasp its sense and meaning (IB-CIM:\n22–23; IB-coll-fakhry: 172–173; IB-coll-genequand: 203\n§60). Still, the outlines of his system are visible. \nInspired by the Porphyrian division of the five voices, knowledge\nstarts with the opposition universal/individual, and develops into\nsyllogistic and non-syllogistic sciences which can explain all aspects\nof reality. Reality consists of matter and forms, but form\ndifferentiates into a stairway of forms, according to their distance\nfrom matter. Forms are essences as well as active potencies, and any\nform is a mover. In addition, the ascension of spiritual forms inside\nman runs parallel to the ascension of forms in nature. They both unite\nin separate substances, pure intelligibles, and true beings, and at\nthe summit, man merges into the Active Intellect. Avempace’s\nintention appears clear, but whether the conjunction is possible and\nhow it occurs remains obscure. \nEven if no metaphysical interpretation of Avempace’s thought\nwould be accepted, his ethical doctrine would remain indisputable.\nAvempace was clearly concerned by man’s fragile nature and the\never-threatening presence of death (Alwuzad 1994) but he was convinced\nthat man could master his destiny with the sole means of his\nintellectual capacity and resolve.","contact.mail":"puigmont@ucm.es","contact.domain":"ucm.es"}]
