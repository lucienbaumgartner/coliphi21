It may be thought excessive to devote two\nchapters to one word, but to the philosophical mathematician it is a\nword of very great importance: like Browning’s grammarian with the\nenclitic δε, I would give the doctrine of this\nword if I were “dead from the waist down” and not merely\nin prison.\n\n\n\n\nRussell has not been alone in thinking that descriptions and definite\ndeterminers are important. The discussion of definite and indefinite\ndescriptions (in English, phrases of the form\n‘the F’ and ‘an\nF’) has been at the center of analytic philosophy for over a\ncentury now. The reason that philosophers find these apparently simple\nexpressions so intriguing is that choices made about their proper\nlogical analysis have repercussions that extend far beyond the\nphilosophy of language and philosophy of logic. In Bertrand\nRussell’s hands, for example, the analysis of descriptions\nbecame a powerful tool for executing important epistemological and\nmetaphysical projects.\n\n\n\nDespite the surface simplicity of determiners and of definite and\nindefinite descriptions, the past 100+ years have seen heated debates\nabout their proper analysis. Some philosophers and linguists treat\ndescriptions as referential expressions, others have treated them as\nquantificational expressions, and some have treated them as\npredicational expressions. Other analyses of descriptions have held\nthat the determiners ‘the’ and ‘a’ do not make\na semantical contribution, but rather a pragmatic contribution to what\nis communicated.  Some recent work in linguistics has even called into\nquestion the idea that definite and indefinite determiners correspond\nto logical elements in the analysis of the logical form of natural\nlanguage. Indeed, there is some reason to think that they are merely\ngrammatical elements for assigning case. \n\n\n\nAs we will see, none of this undermines the idea that some expressions\nof natural language are referential and others quantificational, or\nthat the analysis of these questions isn’t relevant to Russell’s\nepistemological and metaphysical projects, but it is to suggest that\nthe role of the English words ‘the’ and ‘a’\n(and their counterparts in other languages) may be less clear than\nphilosophers in the one hundred years since Russell have imagined.\n\n\n\nOrdinarily, when philosophers talk about descriptions, they have two\nkinds of expressions in mind: definite descriptions—understood\nto be phrases of the form ‘the F’ (and their\nequivalents in other languages), and indefinite\ndescriptions—understood to be phrases of the form ‘an\nF’ (and their equivalents in other languages). As we will\nsee, this way of carving up the kinds of descriptions is far too\nblunt. First, there are many kinds of expressions that appear to have\nthis form but that are often argued not to be descriptions. For\nexample, in the expression ‘John is a lawyer’ it is often\nclaimed that ‘a lawyer’ is not a genuine description, but\nis rather something different—a predicate for example. \n\nSecond, it is arguable that there are many expressions having surface\nforms quite different from ‘the F’ or ‘an\nF’ that could count as being descriptions. For example, it seems\nquite plausible that possessives like ‘my father’ are\ndescriptions (as in ‘the father of me’). Russell also\nproposed that ordinary proper names could be construed as definite\ndescriptions in disguise. Thus a name like ‘Aristotle’\nmight be taken as shorthand for ‘the student of Plato who taught\nAlexander, wrote The Nichomachean Ethics etc.’. Furthermore, as\nwe will see, it has been argued that pronouns like ‘it’\nmight “stand proxy” for descriptions. So, for example, the\npronoun in (1) might be taken to stand proxy for the corresponding\ndefinite description (indicated by square brackets) in (1′).  \n\nCorrelatively, it has been suggested that temporal anaphors like\n‘then’ and modal anaphors like ‘that’ (in\n‘that would have been unfortunate’) are kinds of\ndescriptions. \n\nFinally, as noted above, some recent analyses of descriptions have\nconverged on the view that the contributions the determiners\n‘the’ and ‘a’ make are not semantical, but\nrather pragmatic or even syntactic in nature. All of these\npossibilities will be discussed in due course, but for now we will\nbegin with the analysis of ‘the F’ and ‘an\nF’ first taken up in Russell (1905, 1919).  The key idea of Russell’s proposal is that a sentence like (2)\ncontaining an indefinite description, is understood to have the\nlogical form in (2′),  and a sentence like (3) containing a definite description is\nunderstood to have the logical form in (3′). \n\nBoiled down to its simplest non-technical form, the idea is that an\nexpression of the form in (3) is shorthand for the conjunction of three claims: \n(Following Neale (1990) we will find it useful to substitute\n(3c′) for (3c), which retains Russell’s truth conditions and (as we will see)\nallows us to extend the theory to plural descriptions in a natural\nway.) \nThus tweaked, Russell’s analysis is that the semantics of a definite\ndescription in a sentence involves an existence claim, a\nuniqueness claim, and a maximality claim. There are three main motivations for the theory of descriptions;\nthe first is metaphysical, the second involves semantical concerns in\nthe philosophy of language, and the third is epistemological. Consider a negative existential sentence like (4). Because definite descriptions are devices of quantification on\nRussell’s view, they can enter into scope relations with other\noperators—in this case, for example, negation. Accordingly,\nthere is a kind of ambiguity in (4), between the following two logical\nforms. Here we are using the restricted quantifier notation\nadopted in Neale (1990). So for example, we read: \nas saying “the x such that x is F, is such\nthat x is G”. The material in the square brackets\ngives the\nrestriction on the quantifier, and the formula in parentheses\nafter the bracket constitutes the scope of the restricted quantifier.\n(We sometimes drop the outer parentheses when it is clear what the\nscope of the restricted quantifier is, and we sometimes add\nparentheses around the entire formula for disambiguation.)  Thus, (4a)\ncaptures the fact that the negation has wide scope in a manner that\ncan be glossed thus: it is not the case that the x such\nthat x is the present king of France exists. Whereas (4b) gives\nthe restricted quantifier wide scope, in a manner that can be glossed\nthis way: the\nx such that x is the present king of France does not\nexist. If one wants to avoid the ontological entanglements of nonexistent\nobjects, then one is free to say that (4b) is false (since it involves\nquantifying over things that don’t exist) but that (4a) is true (since\nit is not the case that there is a present king of France). What is\nnegated in (4a) is not a claim about some particular individual, but\nrather a general claim about the world—in effect a claim that\nthe world contains exactly one individual that is presently the king\nof France and that whoever is presently the king of France exists. Russell also had a number of concerns that today we might call\n“semantical”. Consider the expressions ‘the Morning\nStar’ and ‘the Evening Star’. Both refer to (or at\nleast denote) the planet Venus, but there are contexts in which it\nseems incorrect to say that they have the same meaning. For example,\nit was an astronomical discovery that the Morning Star was identical\nto the Evening Star, so it would be odd to treat an expression like\n‘The Morning Star is the Evening Star’ as merely asserting\nsome object to be self-identical. In a similar vein, if we utter\n(6), \n\nwe are most likely not saying that George was curious about whether\nVenus was identical to itself. \n\nFrege proposed that that the solution to this puzzle involved the\nintroduction of senses—abstract objects that fix the referents\nof these expressions, each having a different cognitive significance.\nIn the case of (6), the Fregean solution would be to say that there\nare different senses attached to ‘the Morning Star’ and\n‘the Evening Star’. If we take these expressions to be\nstanding proxy for definite descriptions, then (6) can be unpacked as\nin (6′). \n\nRussell saw that scope relations are relevant here. So, for example,\nsentences like (6) evince what are sometimes called de\ndicto/de re ambiguities. There are circumstances under\nwhich George has some object in particular in mind and is wondering,\nof that object, whether it is the star that appears in the evening. We\ncan use (6) to report this fact as well; In this case we may think of\nthe description as taking wide scope relative to the propositional\nattitude verb ‘wondered’ yielding a logical form like\n(7). \n\nAlternatively, if George has gone mad and is in fact wondering about\nthe law of identity, this may be represented as in (8), where both\ndescriptions have wide scope. \n\nMetaphysical and semantical concerns were important to Russell in\nhis 1905 paper, but epistemological concerns were no less\nsignificant. This became particularly clear when he authored his\n(1910–11) paper “Knowledge by Acquaintance and Knowledge\nby Description.” In that paper, Russell distinguished between\nobjects that we are directly acquainted with and objects that we only\nknow under a description. So, for example, I might know myself by\nacquaintance, but I know the tallest man in Iowa only under a\ndescription. \n\nLudlow (2002) argued that the Cartesianism in Russell’s psychology and\nepistemology led him into difficulties here. The problem is that we\ncan be in error as to whether we are directly acquainted with someone\n(did I really have lunch with a colleague or was that a clever\nhologram?) and this concern (coupled with the Cartesianism that\nRussell held at that point in his career) propelled Russell to\nradically minimize the class of cases where we have\nacquaintance—down to what he called “egocentric particulars,”\nwhich is basically to say I’m only acquainted with myself and sense\ndata.  This in turn led Russell to extend the theory of descriptions\nto almost all uses of names—treating them as definite\ndescriptions in disguise.\n \n\nRussell could have saved himself from some of the more troubling\nconsequences of his view if he had jettisoned the Cartesianism and\nopted for a more liberal notion of acquaintance. Alternatively, if\nHawthorne and Manley (2012) are correct, the true mistake would have\ncome in at the beginning—with the linking of acquaintance and\nreference. In their view a case can be made that reference comes much\ncheaper than Russell imagined.  It would follow that descriptions need\nnot be relied upon as heavily as he imagined \n\nThe analysis of descriptions has been extended from canonical examples\nof descriptions (expressions of the form ‘the F’\nand ‘an F’) to expressions that don’t have this\nsurface form. As we noted in section 3, one of the key motivations for\nRussell’s theory of descriptions was the idea that it could ameliorate\nthe problem of non-denoting expressions—expressions like\n‘the golden mountain’, and ‘the present king of\nFrance’. But the account has been extended to other\nconstructions as well, including proper names, pronouns, and temporal\nanaphors, all with mixed results. \n\nIf the theory of descriptions can unburden us metaphysically in the\ncase of nondenoting expressions like ‘the present king of\nFrance’ can it do the same for us with nondenoting names like\n‘Pegasus’?  Perhaps, but there is no shortage of difficulties. \n\nOne problem has to do with the fact that there is often no single\nshared description for certain fictions. Even a simple case like\n‘Santa Claus’ presents difficulties here. Many people will\nassociate many different descriptions with the name ‘Santa\nClaus’. Which, if any of those descriptions is the correct one,\nand in what sense can we say that all the people deploying the name\n‘Santa Claus’ and associating different descriptions with\nthe term are talking about the same thing? Complicating the matter\nfurther, others might not use the term ‘Santa Claus’ but a\nname like ‘Saint Nick’ or ‘Babbo Natale’, and\nassociate those terms with descriptions that converge to some degree\nwith typical Santa descriptions. \n\nAt best the Russellian can argue that others are in the same\nboat here. Consider the option of non-existent objects. If such objects\nare individuated by their properties then we can again ask which\nproperties the non-existent object Santa Claus is supposed to have. And\nis the Italian who deploys the term ‘Babbo Natale’\ntalking about the same nonexistent object as an American that deploys the\nname ‘Santa Claus’? (See Everett\nand Hofweber (2000) and French and Wettstein (2001)\nfor papers on these general issues, and see Zalta (1983, 1988) for a\nrobust defense of the nonexistent object strategy). \n\nOn the face of it then, a naïve application of the descriptive\ntheory of names faces some serious difficulties. \nDevitt and Sterelney (1998, 48 ff.) catalogue them as follows: The principled basis objection. There are a number of\ndifferent descriptions that people might associate with a name like\n‘Aristotle’.  An historian might favor the description of\n‘the teacher of Alexander the Great’, a Catholic Church\nhistorian might know him under the description of ‘the leading\ninfluence on Saint Aquinas’, some philosophers might know him\nunder the description of ‘the pupil of Plato and author\nof The Metaphysics and\nThe Nichomachean Ethics’, Plato himself might\nhave known him under the description ‘the obnoxious student of\nmine.’ Which of these descriptions is the correct one, what is\nthe principled basis that determines which description is correct? The unwanted ambiguity objection. Suppose that we\nrespond to the principled basis objection by letting many flowers\nbloom. That is, suppose we argue that there is no single correct\ndescription associated with the name but there are many. We now run\ninto the teeth of the problem of unwanted ambiguity. Are there really\nthat many different names, each corresponding to an different\ndescription? If so, why does ‘Aristotle was Aristotle’\nseem so much less informative than ‘the teacher of Alexander the\nGreat was the leading influence on Saint Aquinas’? The unwanted necessity objection. Consider a sentence\nlike ‘Aristotle taught Alexander the Great’. This seems to\nbe a contingent claim—one that is true but matters could have\ngone otherwise.  Aristotle could have decided it was immoral to take\nthe position, or Phillip of Macedonia could have decided that\nAristotle was not the best tutor for his young Alexander. We can\nimagine numerous possible worlds in which the sentence turns out to be\nfalse (unlike necessary claims like ‘5+7=12’ which appear\nto be true in every possible world). But now consider this sentence\nwith the description unpacked.  We get something like ‘The pupil\nof Plato and teacher of Alexander the Great taught Alexander the\nGreat’, and it seems that this would have to be true in every\nworld in which someone satisfies the relevant description. The problem\nis that the Russellian analysis seems to turn a contingent proposition\ninto a necessary proposition. \n\nSearle (1958, 1969; 162 ff.) offers some modifications designed to\novercome these difficulties with the descriptive theory of names.\nConsider a name like ‘Socrates’. Is it really part of the\nmeaning of that name that its bearer drank hemlock, taught Plato and\ndid all of the other things that we are told that he did when we study\nthe history of philosophy? Searle suggests that we needn’t associate\nthe meaning of a name with a description that contains all of these\nelements—it might be enough that most of them hold, or that a\nsuitably weighted bundle of them hold. (Other versions of this idea\nwere proposed in Strawson (1959; 180 ff.) and Wilson\n(1959).) \n\nHow does Searle’s proposal help with the objections just listed? The\nunwanted necessity objection collapses immediately because the use of a\nname does not commit the speaker to the object in question having all\nthe properties in the bundle. When I say Aristotle authored\nthe Nichomachean Ethics it is as though I uttered\nthe following: \n\nSomeone might be associated with this bundle of properties and not have\nwritten the Nichomachean Ethics (so long as they had\nenough of the other properties). The principled basis objection is supposed to collapse because\nthere is now no issue of choosing which description is the correct\none—if the theologian, the historian, and the philosopher all\nassociate different descriptions and hence different properties with\nAristotle, all of those properties will make it into the bundle of\nproperties for the name ‘Aristotle’. We don’t need to\nworry about the principled basis for choosing the relevant properties\nbecause we don’t have to choose period. We take them all. \n\nThe unwanted ambiguity objection is supposed to collapse because\nevery use of the name ‘Aristotle’ is now associated with\nthe same bundle of properties. ‘Aristotle is Aristotle’ is\nuninformative because it is shorthand for (10). \n\nAs compelling as Searle’s proposal may seem at first blush, it soon\nruns into problems of its own.\nAs Devitt and Sterelny observe, the three\nobjections to the traditional descriptive theory of names come creeping\nback. For starters, one presumably doesn’t want every single fact about\nAristotle to make it into the bundle of properties that we associate\nwith his name (that would lead us down the path to an extreme holism in\nwhich every fact that we acquire changes the meaning of the name), so\nwhat is the principled basis for deciding what goes into the bundle?\nWorse, what is the principled basis by which we weight the importance\nof the properties in the bundle? \n\nThe unwanted ambiguity objection returns as well if we allow that\ndifferent people will associate different bundles of properties with a\nname or at least weight those properties differently. One might be\ntempted to dodge this problem by arguing that the relevant bundle of\nproperties for a name is socially fixed and does not vary between\nindividuals, but then it is hard to see how names like\n‘Scott’ and ‘Sir Walter’ could be associated\nwith different bundles of properties since the community as a whole is\nlikely to attribute the same bundle of properties (with the same\nweights) to these names. This is a problem, because different bundles\nof properties are needed to distinguish the differences in cognitive\nsignificance between ‘Scott’ and ‘Sir Walter’.\nThere is a dilemma then: one can avoid the problem of unwanted\nambiguity only at the expense of the problem of accounting for the\ncognitive significance of names.  \n\nFinally, as Kripke (1980) argued, Searle’s solution really doesn’t\nhelp with the problem of unwanted necessity. Aristotle might have had\nnone of the properties that we ordinarily associate with his\nname. Searle certainly didn’t think this was possible—for him,\nif nothing had the properties in question (or enough of them) then\nAristotle did not exist. But Kripke (ch. 2) enlisted a number of\narguments to show that the behavior of names in modal environments\nsuggests otherwise. For example even if we concede that Aristotle did\nall the things he was supposed to have done, it is still the case that\nAristotle could have refrained from doing any of the things he did. He\ncould have forsaken philosophy for other pursuits. He could have been\nrun over by a chariot at age two. But then how do we make sense of a\ndescriptive name in a sentence like (11)? \n\nIf the description is unpacked, we get something like (11′). \n\nBut (11′) is false. There is no nearby possible\nworld where Aristotle did all those things by age two.  \n\nKripke held that the behavior of names in these environments could\nonly be explained if we think of the names as being rigid\ndesignators—i.e., as devices that rigidly pick out an individual\nacross possible worlds. Kripke also stressed that this is not really a\npoint about conditional or modal sentences—the same point can be\nmade for simple declarative sentences evaluated in a counterfactual\nsituation. So, for example, take a simple sentence like (12). \n\nWe can evaluate this sentence in other possible worlds. We can say\nthat it might have been true under certain circumstances. But it does\nnot seem plausible that there is a nearby possible world where the\nfollowing is true. \n\nFinally, Donnellan (1972) and Kripke (1980) both\nargued that the Descriptive Theory of Names suffers from an important\nepistemological defect. The descriptions that we associate with names\nroutinely do not describe the individuals that we intend to refer to.\nAsked to come up with a description to substitute for the name\n‘Einstein’, many people would write ‘The inventor of\nthe atom bomb’ (which of course he was not). Others might write\n‘the inventor of the theory of relativity’, but then asked\nwhat the theory of relativity was would respond ‘the theory that\nEinstein invented’. The descriptive information that we associate\nwith names just is not sufficient to pick out the intended\nreferent.  \n\nKripke’s positive proposal—suggestion really—was that\nnames are associated with a causal chain; there is an initial baptism\nof an individual (e.g., Albert Einstein as ‘Albert\nEinstein’) and that referent is passed along to other users of\nthe name. Likewise the referent of ‘Aristotle’ is not\nfixed by some description, but by a causal chain linking our use of\n‘Aristotle’ with some historical individual. (This is not\nthe place for an extended discussion of this proposal, but see Devitt\n1981 and Salmon 1991 for development of this idea and Evans (1973,\n1980) for criticism.) \n\nIn spite of the great force of Kripke’s criticism of the\ndescriptive theory of names, there have been some significant attempts\nto answer them. One idea (explored by Loar (1976), McDowell (1977),\nand Schiffer (1978)) would have the description be something like\n‘the individual designated by the name\n‘Aristotle’. For Kripke (1980), and Devitt (1981) this\nsort of approach was hopelessly circular. Indeed, Devitt and Sterelny\ndisparagingly referred to the position as “circular\ndescriptivism” (but see Kroon (1989) for an attempt to disarm\nthe circularity charge). Another idea (taken up in Kroon (1987) and\nJackson (1998)) was to build reference to the causal chain into the\ndescription itself. Thus, ‘Aristotle’ might stand proxy\nfor ‘the individual linked by a causal chain to\n‘Aristotle’’ (this view was dubbed “causal\ndescriptivism” by Lewis (1984)). Whatever the merits of these\nviews, they clearly abandon some of the key motivations for the\ndescriptive theories of names—in particular the idea that the\ndescription could do the work of providing the sense of the name. \n\nStill, from a linguistic point of view, we should note that there are\nfeatures of names in natural language that make them appear to be\nsimilar to descriptions. Names can take determiners like\n‘a’ and ‘the’ (indeed in some languages they\nroutinely do so), which suggests that they are behaving more like\nnouns than like saturated referring expression. Indeed it is a\nwidespread linguistic analysis of names that they have possibly empty\ndeterminer positions, so that a name like Aristotle has at a minimum\nthe following structure, which represents a syntactic structure for a\ndeterminer phrase having an empty determiner and the noun\n‘Aristotle’ as constituents: \n\nIn addition, Burge (1973) offered a number of arguments in support of\nthe idea that names really are predicates, and further support has\ncome from Hornsby (1976), Larson and Segal (1995) and Eluguardo\n(2002). (But see Boer (1975), Bach (1987), and Higginbotham (1988) for\ncriticism.)  \n\nThe Burge story had the determiner as something like a bare\ndemonstrative. It is not a long step to the supposition that the\ndefault interpretation of the null element is to treat it as the\ndefinite determiner ‘the’. This is in effect the proposal\noffered in Larson and Segal (1995); ‘Aristotle’ stands in\nfor an incomplete definite description of the form ‘the\nAristotle’. In both cases, the predicate in question would be\nsomething like being named ‘Aristotle’, so again it is\ndifficult to see how this general approach (without emendation) can\nsatisfy Russell’s desiderata that the description play the role of\nsenses.  \n\nAn alternative riff on these ideas which has been widely\ndiscussed, but not, so far as I know, published, would be to suppose\nthat there is a rigid property of being Aristotle—one that only\nAristotle could have in any possible world (this property would be\ncompletely independent of being named ‘Aristotle’). The\nidea is that the content of the description could consist solely of\nthat property. For example, when we say that ‘Aristotle might\nhave been run over by a chariot’ we would in effect be saying\nthere is a possible world in which the unique individual who has the\nproperty of being Aristotle was run over by a chariot. It seems that\ncharges of circularity are not so easily advanced here, although the\nview does raise questions about the nature of these rigid properties\nand our epistemic access to them. (See Parsons (1982) for an account\nof the logic of rigid properties.) \n\nAnother class of responses has attempted to retain the standard\ndescriptive content of names but moved to\ncircumvent Kripke’s modal worries. Dummett (1973;\n111–135, 1981) and Sosa (1996; ch. 3, 2001) proposed that the\nbehavior of names in modal contexts can be accounted for if\nwe take names to be descriptions with mandatory wide scope. So, for\nexample, (11) could be taken to have the following logical form.  \n\nKripke discussed this possibility briefly in the Preface to\n(1980), holding that the move overlooks the fact that we can simply\nevaluate (12) in other possible worlds, hence no embedding within\nmodal operators is really necessary. For that matter, consider a\nsentence like ‘(12) might have been true’. How does a wide\nscope story help us in this case? More recently, Soames (2002; ch. 2)\nhas expanded on Kripke’s points and marshaled a number of additional\narguments against the wide scope thesis, including the observation\nthat if one embeds a name within a propositional attitude environment\nand in turn embeds the propositional attitude in a modal environment\nthen one is in the peculiar position of needing the description to\nescape the modal environment (to honor the rigidity facts) but not\nescape the propositional attitude environment (to honor the\n‘Scott’/‘Sir Walter’ cases that Russell (1905)\nemployed to motivate the descriptive theory of names). In other words,\nthe description theorists need to have their cake and eat it too. \n\nAnother possibility (considered in Nelson (2002)) would be to argue\nthat names are “rigidified descriptions” (i.e.,\ndescriptions like ‘The individual who actually was a student of\nPlato, taught Alexander, etc.’ or perhaps rigidified causal\ndescriptions. This general strategy is criticized by Soames (2002;\nch. 2), who argues that ‘the actual F is G’\nand ‘n is G’, where n is a name, do not\nexpress the same proposition. The argument for this turns on cases\nwhere these expressions are embedded in propositional attitude\nenvironments, as in (14a) and (14b). \n\nAccording to Soames, there are contexts of utterance and worlds of\nevaluation where (14a) is true but (14b) is false. Accordingly,\n‘the actual F is G’ and ‘n is\nG’ cannot express the same proposition. Hence names\ncannot be rigidified descriptions. (But see Nelson (2002) for a\nresponse to this argument.)  \n\nYet another approach to defending descriptions would be to employ a\n“2-dimensionalist” semantics (in the sense of Stalnaker\n(1978, 1990), Davies and Humberstone (1980)) to account for the\nbehavior of descriptive names in modal environments. Some form of this\nidea has been offered by Evans (1982), Stanley (1997a, 1997b),\nChalmers (2000, 2002), and Jackson (1998). Here the basic idea is that\nthe content of a description picks out different contents in different\npossible worlds. Accordingly, if we want to evaluate the descriptive\ncontent of ‘Aristotle’ in another possible world, we do\nnot use the descriptive content ‘student of Plato…’\nin every world, since that is only an appropriate descriptive content\nfor some worlds. In other worlds we will draw on other descriptive\ncontents. As Jackson (1998, 112) puts the idea: \n\nSoames (2009) has responded that this particular 2-dimensionalist\napproach is tantamount to the claim that descriptive theories of\nreference determination are priori irrefutable, since any evidence\nthat a term refers to an object is automatically taken to demonstrate\nthe existence of an implicit description in our minds that\nsuccessfully determines reference, whether or not we can successfully\nstate it. Additional criticism of 2-dimensionalism criticism can be\nfound in Block and Stalnaker (1998) and Byrne and Pryor (2006). \n\nConsider sentence (1) again. \n\nOne of the arguments that Strawson (1952) enlisted on behalf of the\nreferential theory of descriptions was the following.  Since the\npronoun in (1) gets its content from the description that it is\nanaphoric on, and because the pronoun refers, it must be the case that\nthe description also refers. Strawson’s idea was that descriptions\nrefer because their anaphoric pronouns do.  \n\nThere are obviously two responses to Strawson here. One may either\nreject the idea that the content of the pronoun is in some sense\ndependent upon the description (for example, one might claim it\nindependently picks out some object raised to salience (Lewis 1979),\none might claim that it is a bound variable (Geach 1962)), or one can\nargue that the pronoun is a kind of definite description in\ndisguise. This third idea has been explored by Parsons (1978, Other\nInternet Resources), Cooper (1979), Davies (1981), Neale (1990,\nch. 6), Heim (1990), Ludlow (1994), van Rooy (2001), and Elbourne\n(2005) (the view is sometimes attributed to Evans (1977), but it is\nmore accurate to say that he thought the pronouns had their references\nfixed rigidly by descriptive content). As noted above, the basic idea\nis that the pronoun in (1) may stand proxy for the square-bracketed\ndefinite description in (1′). \n\nThe philosophical attraction of this view should be obvious. What it\nallows us to do is to make sense of cases where we employ nondenoting\npronouns in negative existentials, belief reports, and fictional\ncontexts. Examples would be the following: \n    (15) The present king of France doesn’t clean my pool. He doesn’t\n    exist, either. \n\n    (16) Mary believes that the present king of France exists and that\n    he cleans my pool. \n\nClearly if these pronouns are referring expressions then any victories\nwon through the theory of descriptions are going to be fleeting. In\neffect, all the unwelcome metaphysical commitments that we banished by\nusing descriptions would re-enter via the back door as soon as we\nemploy anaphoric pronouns in our discourse. But if we treat anaphors\nas standing proxy for descriptions, the back door is blocked as\nwell. \n\nConsider an example like (16), with the descriptive material spelled\nout. \n\nMary’s belief is strange, but general for all that, so we can report\nit without being committed to the existence of a present king of\nFrance.  \n\nNor is this strategy necessarily limited to pronominal\nanaphora. Ludlow (1999, 2000) has argued that temporal and modal\nanaphora can be handled in a similar manner. In effect, one can take a\ntemporal anaphor as standing proxy for a when-clause and a modal\nanaphor like ‘that’ in ‘that would have hurt’\nas standing proxy for the antecedent of a conditional. \n\nTo illustrate, consider an example like (17), due to Partee (1972).  \n\nNow clearly this does not mean that I turned the stove off once in my\nlife, but rather there is intuitively some relevant time when I turned\nit off—for example, when I left the house this morning.  The\nstandard analysis would have it that I refer to a past time or past\ntime interval here, but such an analysis does not go down well with\npresentists, who do not believe that there are such intervals, and at\na minimum we might think there is something epistemologically\ntroubling about referring to past and future times (to see this,\nconsider what a Russellian might say, given that some notion of direct\nacquaintance is required on the Russellian view). An alternative would\nbe to suppose that the implicit temporal anaphora here can be\naccounted for by the introduction of descriptive material—an\nexplicit temporal when-clause—as in (18), for example.  \n\nThe presentist can then treat ‘when’ as a primitive tense\nthat holds between propositions. (See Ludlow (1999) for discussion of\ndifficulties with this strategy.) As in the pronominal anaphora case,\ndescriptive material does the work that reference does in most other\naccounts of the semantics of temporal and modal discourse. Again, the\ngoal is metaphysical austerity and faithfulness to our epistemic\nposition. \n\nClearly descriptive anaphora represents a powerful extension of\nRussell’s theory of descriptions and a useful tool\nfor presentists and modal antirealists. For all of that, the\ntheory has encountered a number of objections.\n\nConsider (19), for example, and a paraphrase (20) in which the pronoun\nis rendered as a description. \n    (19) If a man enters the room, he will turn\nthe switch. \n    (20) If a man enters the room, the man who\nenters will turn the switch.  Heim (1982) observed that (20) (unlike (19)) implies that a unique man\nentered the room and that (20) will therefore be false if two men\nenter the room. The question is, is there some way to answer this\nobjection and retain the descriptive analysis of anaphora? Davies\n(1981), Lappin (1989), Neale (1990, chapter 6), Krifka (1996), and\nYoon (1996) explored the possibility that the descriptive pronouns are\nin fact numberless—that is, the pronoun in (20) might in fact be\nproxy for something like ‘the man or men who enter’. (See\nKanazawa (2001) for a literature review and criticism of this\nidea.) \n\nAnother idea, considered in Heim (1990), Ludlow (1994), and Elbourne\n(2005) is to see how descriptive theories of pronouns fare when\nembedded within an event-based (or situation based) theories of\nconditionals like those articulated by Berman (1987), Kratzer (1989),\nand Lycan (1984). On an event-based analysis of conditionals, we would\nexpect a treatment of (19) along the lines of (21).  Sentence (21) seems to accurately reflect the truth conditions of\n‘He will turn the switch’, even in the case where two men\nturn the switch simultaneously. To see this we need merely recognize\nthat even though two men (say Ralph and Norton) may turn the switch\nsimultaneously, it is still the case that we can recognize two\nindependent minimal events; one where Ralph turns the switch and one\nwhere Norton turns the switch. The strategy is to show that the\nsupposed loss of uniqueness is an epiphenomenon, and is due to the\nfact that the descriptive pronoun’s denotation is relativized to\nevents. \n\nUnfortunately, there are more sophisticated versions of these cases\nwhere simple relativization to events will not do.  These include the\nsage plant examples discussed in Heim (1982, 1990) and Kadmon\n(1990). \n\nHere the problem is that the minimal event appears to contain ten sage\nplants, so we are left to ask how the pronoun, rendered as a definite\ndescription complete with a uniqueness claim, is supposed to work.\nThere is no unique sage plant in the minimal events.  Or at least a\nmore detailed story needs to be told. \nFinally, there is (23). (Heim (1990) attributes the example to Hans\nKamp and Jan van Eijk). \n\nThe interesting feature of this example is that the uniqueness\nimplications of the definite descriptions remain problematic, for they\nimply that there is a unique satisfier of the description in each\nevent. But notice that because the bishops bless each other, it\nappears there is no unique individual that satisfies either\ndescription in the consequent of (23 ).  This class of problems,\nsometimes called bishop sentences, has yielded a number of\nproposed solutions.  For example, Elbourne (2005) has argued that the\nminimal situation story can suffice if there are subsituations\ncontaining only one bishop.  Here is a crude version of the idea: If\nthere is a subsituation s1 with only one bishop and a subsituation s2\nwith one different bishop, there could be a containing situation s0 in\nwhich the bishops from those subsituations bless each other (see Kroll\n(2008) and Elbourne (2009, 2010) for further discussion).\n\n \nAn alternative idea is to treat the pronoun in these cases as semantically\nakin to an indefinite description rather than a definite description.\n(See Groendijk and Stokhof (1991), Chierchia (1996),\nvan der Does (1994), and also see van Rooy (2001)\nfor criticism. The proposal in King (1978) has a similar effect.) If we\nmake this move, then (24) might be glossed as in (24′). \n\nSimilarly, the sage plant example in (23) would receive the gloss in\n(23′). \n\nSuch solutions thus surrender the uniqueness entailment in Russell’s\nproposal (we will return to this idea in section 6.1).  Of course, as\nKadmon (1990) stressed, pronouns typically do appear to introduce\nuniqueness, as an example like (25) shows.  \n\nNotice that the first sentence doesn’t introduce uniqueness, so\nthe pronoun introduces something that indefinites do not. What\nthis means is that whatever account we give of pronouns—through\ndynamic semantics or whatever—we will want to account for this\nvariation in interpretation in a principled way. We want to know\nprecisely why a pronoun looks like a definite description here, but an\nindefinite description there. Whether extant accounts are satisfactory\nin this respect is subject to debate. \n\nOf course, none of this is to say that solving this problem will close\nthe book on the analysis of descriptive pronouns. A number of other\npuzzles remain, including the problem of pronominal contradiction,\nwhich has been discussed by Strawson (1952), Davies (1981), Ludlow and\nNeale (1991), and van Rooy (2001) among many others. Consider the\nfollowing brief dialogue.  \n\nThe problem is that if the pronoun is to have its descriptive\ncontent recovered from previous discourse, the pronoun\n‘He’ is going to stand proxy for a description like\n‘the man who fell in front of the train’ or ‘a man\nwho fell in front of the train’. Here, considerations about\nuniqueness implications are of little help. One possibility, advocated\nby Davies (1981) and Ludlow and Neale (1991) is to say that speaker B\nis engaged in a kind of pretense—playing along with speaker A,\nas if saying with scare quotes something like B′.  \n\nOther strategies are also in play, for example one might ignore\nthe descriptive content of the antecedent and build the content out of\nthematic roles like agent and theme (Ludlow 1994), or perhaps\nmetalinguistic material (“the person you spoke\nof”). Whatever the ultimate disposition of these cases, it is\nfair to say that there are more issues here than whether pronouns are\nto be treated as standing proxy for definite descriptions or\nindefinite descriptions. \n\nMost of the action in the philosophy of language has been with\ndefinite descriptions, but indefinite descriptions have also generated\na fair bit of attention—some of it mirroring the debates about\ndefinite descriptions. For example Chastain (1975), Donnellan (1978),\nWilson (1978), and Fodor and Sag (1982), held that indefinite\ndescriptions are ambiguous between referential and quantificational\ninterpretations. That is to say, there are referential and\nquantificational uses of indefinite descriptions and these are a\nreflex of a genuine semantical ambiguity. The basic structure of their\nargument was the following. Referential uses of indefinites must be\neither a function of quantifier scope or a semantically referential\nindefinite determiner. Since indefinites with the relevant scopal\nproperties would violate standard syntactic constraints, indefinites\nmust in some cases be semantically referential.  Examples of the kinds of syntactic considerations they had in mind\ninclude island constraints like the following. Quantified expressions\nare ordinarily considered to be clause bound. So, for example, a\nsentence like (26) is not supposed to have the interpretation in\n(26′), where the quantified expression takes wide scope. (26) Someone believes that every man I know\nis angry. (26′) *[every y: man(y) and\n know(I,y)]([Some x: person(x)](x believes\n that y is angry)) \n\nOn the other hand, it seems more natural to say that (27) can have\nthe interpretation corresponding to the structure in (27′). (27) Everyone believes that a man I know is\nangry. (27′) [An x: man(x) and \n know(I,x)]([every y: person(y)](y believes\nthat x is angry)) \n\nA more compelling example of an island constraint would be the\nantecedent of a conditional, as in (28), which is not supposed to have\nthe interpretation in (28′). (28) If every person I know is happy then I\nwill be happy. (28′) *[every x: person(x) and\nknow(I,x)](if x is happy then I will be happy) \n\nBut a “wide understanding” of (29) does seem to be\npossible. (29) If a person I know is happy then I will be\nhappy. (29′) [An x: person(x) and\n    know(I,x)](if x is happy then I will be happy) \n\nThe moral was supposed to be that these “wide” readings\nare not the reflex of wide scope quantification (that would be to make\nindefinite descriptions syntactically special), but rather due to the\nfact that the indefinites in these examples are referring\nexpressions. \n\nThe Fodor and Sag argumentation was taken up in the philosophical\nliterature by King (1988) and Ludlow and Neale (1991), who argued that\nthere is a confusion in the Fodor and Sag\ndiscussion. Kripke’s claim, of course, was that referential\nuses of a description are a function of pragmatics, not quantifier\nscope. Nor, of course, could a referential use be associated with wide\nscope, as Kripke (1977) argued forcefully—they simply\nare not the same phenomenon. The problem is that the Fodor and Sag\narguments do not address the pragmatic account of referential\nuses, which of course was the alternative advanced by Kripke. \n\nIn addition, there do appear to be more quantifier scope\npossibilities than the Fodor and Sag proposal seems to allow. Consider\n(30), from Ludlow and Neale and (31) from Kripke. (30) Each teacher overheard many\nexclamations that a student of mine cheated. (31) Hoover charged that the Berrigans plotted to kidnap a high\n    American official. \n\nIn the case of (30) ‘a student of mine’ can have narrow\nscope with respect to ‘every teacher’ but wide scope with\nrespect to ‘many exclamations’. Similarly, as Kripke\n(1977) observed, intermediate scope is possible in (24) (as when the\nBerrigans have someone in mind, but Hoover does not know who). Similar\nobservations about the possibility of intermediate scope have been\nmade by Farkas (1981), Rooth and Partee (1982), King (1988), Ruys\n(1992) and Abusch (1994). How are Fodor and Sag supposed to generate\nreadings like that, given only a referential/quantificational\nambiguity and no relative scope relations? As Kripke put the point,\n“no two-fold distinction can replace Russell’s notion of\nscope.” While this tells against referential analysis of\nindefinites, it opens a can of worms for the other approaches as well;\nfor example, if indefinite descriptions are ordinary quantified\nexpressions, then why do they have such extraordinary island-escaping\nproperties (or at least appear to)? \n\nOne attractive possibility that has emerged from the literature in\nDiscourse Representation Theory—in particular in work by Heim\n(1982), Kamp (1984), Deising (1992), Kamp and Reyle (1993)—has\nbeen that the appearance of a determiner in an indefinite description\nis chimeral—‘a man’ in fact comes to an expression\ncontaining a predicate and a free variable, as in\n‘man x’. This free variable might then be picked up by\nsome sort of discourse operator as discussed in the previous\nsection. \n\nAccordingly, a sentence like (1) might have a logical form, or\nbetter, a discourse representation structure akin to (1*) (abstracting\nfrom details). \n\nThis general strategy gives us some explanation for why indefinites\nsometimes appear to have island escaping properties as in cases like\nconditionals. The answer is that they don’t escape at all, but are\nfree variables that are bound by (or existentially closed by)\noperators outside of the island. This describes the DRT strategy only\nin the most general of terms, but we can already see that the\nquestions that plague the Russellian story have their reflex here as\nwell. Everyone now recognizes that intermediate scope is a possibility\nin cases like (30) and (31), but the question is just what mechanisms\nmake it possible?  The Russellian has to opt for operators with\nunusual island escaping properties. What is the DRT theorist to\ndo? \n\nOne option, explored by Reinhart (1996), Kratzer (1995),\nand Winter (1997), employs the device of choice functions.\nAs Winter informally characterizes the doctrine, the idea is\nas follows. (A1) Indefinites lack quantificational force\nof their own (A2) An indefinite NP in an argument\nposition, however, ends up denoting an individual, because the\nsemantics involves a free function variable that assigns an individual\nto the restriction predicate. (A3) This function variable is existentially\nclosed, together with the restriction that it is a choice function: a\nfunction that chooses a member from any non-empty predicate it\ngets. \n\nHow does this help in the case of intermediate scope? For Reinhart\n(1996), choice functions by themselves cannot account for\nthe extant phenomena (in particular cases of intermediate\nscope), so the theory must be supplemented with standard quantifier\nraising accounts as well. Winter (1997) has offered a more general\naccount employing choice functions (also extending the account to\nplural indefinites) that purport to make do without the additional\nresource of quantifier raising. \n\nThe interesting conceptual issue that arises, whether we opt for\nstandard DRT accounts or such accounts supplemented with choice\nfunctions, is whether this departs from the Russellian analysis of\nindefinite descriptions in important ways. In one respect, of course,\nthe accounts are very different—Russell takes indefinite\ndescriptions to be existential quantifiers, while the DRT accounts take\nthem to be akin to free variables. On the other hand, once the free\nvariables are interpreted the effect comes to very much the same thing:\nin both cases the accounts are fundamentally quantificational. \n\nNot everyone has seen DRT theory and choice functions in this\nlight. Kratzer (1995) maintained that the choice function\nprovided something like a referential interpretation of an indefinite,\nhere understood as a “pointing gesture within the mind of the\nspeaker,” but as Winter points out this raises some difficult\nmethodological issues, and in the view of Ludlow and Neale (1991) this\namounts to a conflation of the notions of referentiality and\nspecificity, and a further confusion about the nature of specificity.\nOn their view, using an expression with a particular individual in mind\nis not the same thing as referring to that individual. For example,\naccording to Ludlow and Neale, there are a number of possible uses to\nwhich we can put indefinite descriptions, including referential uses,\nspecific uses, definite uses, and purely existential uses. To\nunderstand this distinction, consider the following cases. Referential use. A teacher announces the following to the\nclass, with a single red haired student in the front row. “I’m\nnot going to name names, but I have good reason to believe that red\nhaired student in the front row cheated on yesterday’s exam.” In\nthis case the teacher has singular grounds for the utterance, and is\ncommunicating directly to the audience the identity of the individual\nthat serves as the grounds for the utterance. Specific use. In this case the teacher has singular\ngrounds, and wishes to communicate that fact to the audience, but does\nnot wish to communicate the identity of the cheater to the class.\n“I’m sorry to announce that yesterday I witnessed a student\ncheating on the exam.” Definite use: In this case the teacher knows that there\nmust have been a unique cheater, but does not know the identity of the\ncheater and hence does not have singular grounds for the utterance and\naccordingly is not in a position to communicate the identity of the\ncheater except under extraordinary circumstances. “I have\nstatistical evidence that a student cheated on the exam. Fortunately\nthere only appears to be one cheater.” Purely quantificational use: In this instance not only does\nthe teacher fail to know the identity of the cheater, but also fails to\nknow whether or not there was a unique cheater (perhaps there were\nseveral). “I have evidence that a student cheated on the exam.\nThe answer sheet was stolen from my office. Hopefully, there was only\none student involved. We will know more pending an\ninvestigation.” According to Ludlow and Neale, it is implausible to think that all\nof these uses can be chalked up to semantic facts. In each case, the\nproposition expressed is argued to be that which would be expressed if\nthe indefinite determiner were replaced by the existential\nquantifier. The different uses of descriptions then stem from the\napplication of Gricean principles of conversational implicature to\nwhat was literally said. So far we have discussed singular definite and indefinite\ndescriptions (and the possibility that names are descriptions) but as\nit turns out these types of descriptions are probably not the most\ncommonly occurring descriptions in English. Ultimately we also want to\ntake into account plural descriptions (as in ‘the dogs are\nbarking’), mass noun descriptions (as in ‘the water is\ncold’), and generics (as in ‘the dog is a loyal\nfriend’). The question is whether each of these constructions\nmust be treated in a different way, or whether it is possible to unify\ntheir treatment with the analysis of definite descriptions discussed\nabove. Sharvy (1980) suggested that a unified treatment is indeed\npossible (this is also a possibility that Chomsky (1975) saw). \n\nSharvy’s idea was that we could generalize Russell’s theory of\ndescriptions by ‘the F (or Fs) is\n(are) G’ to be equivalent to the following, \n\nwhere F can be either a singular count noun (like\n‘dog’), a plural count noun (like ‘dogs’) or a\nmass noun (like ‘water’), and the symbol ‘≤’\nindicates a parthood relation. Following Brogaard (2007) we can take\nthis as saying ‘an F that every F is part of satisfies\n“G”’. It follows then, that a definite\ndescription ‘the F’ (‘the Fs’) denotes the\nmaximal sum or mass in the extension of F. So, for example, when we\nutter ‘The dogs’ we are denoting the maximal set of dogs in\nthe domain of discourse. When we utter ‘the water’, we are\ndenoting the maximal mass of water in the discourse. In the case of\nsingular definite descriptions (like ‘the dog’) we are\nstill denoting the maximal set of dogs in the domain of discourse\n(since in this case there is only one dog). In effect, singular\ndefinite descriptions are just special cases\nof Sharvy’s generalized theory of descriptions. \n\nFara (2001) argued that the same strategy can be extended to\ngenerics as well. \n\nIf natural kinds like species and sub-species can bear the parthood\nrelation to one another, then one can extend the Sharvy parthood\noperator to these cases as well. I don’t mean to suggest that Sharvy’s\nanalysis of these constructions has no competitors, but the fact that\nhe was able to give a unified treatment of these constructions\nsuggests that competitors will have to do the same. It really does\nseem as though singular, plural, mass, and generic descriptions are\nnot so different in kind. A unified Russellian treatment of the\nconstructions seems possible. In section 7 we will return to the\nquestion of whether the maximality claim should be part of the\nanalysis or whether it represents a weakness in the analysis.  The theory of descriptions has encountered its fair share of\ncriticism. This criticism has ranged from contentions that Russell\nsimply got the truth conditions wrong in important cases to nagging\nworries about the details of the proposal—in particular worries\nrelating to the nature of the descriptive content. As we will see,\nnone of these concerns have been completely ameliorated. \n\nStrawson (1950) objected that Russell’s theory is simply incorrect\nabout the truth conditions of sentences like ‘The present king\nof France is bald’. According to Russell’s analysis, this\nsentence is false (since it contains an existence claim to the effect\nthat there is a present king of France), but according to Strawson,\nthis does not conform to our intuitions about the truth of an\nutterance of that sentence. In Strawson’s view, an utterance of the\nsentence in a world where there is no present king of France is\nneither true nor false; perhaps the sentence has a truth value gap, or\nperhaps it fails to express a determinate proposition (Strawson\nvacillated on this), but either way it does not appear to be\nfalse. Strawson held that this fact supported a referential\ninterpretation of expressions like ‘The present king of\nFrance’. \n\nIf there is no present king of France, then an utterance containing\nsuch an expression is somehow defective. It is as if I looked into my\ndesk drawer, not allowing you to see what I was looking at, and said\n‘that is a fine green one.’ Strawson held that utterances\nlike these do not entail the existence of a fine green one or the\npresent King of France, but rather presuppose their\nexistence. If the expressions fail to refer, then there is a\npresupposition failure and the utterance fails to have a determinate\ntruth value. (Notice that this sort of failure is not supposed to\nundermine the meaningfulness of the sentences that we utter; for\nStrawson, sentences are meaningful in and of themselves, independently\nof the utterance situation. Utterances of meaningful sentences may be\ntrue or false or, if here is a presupposition failure, they may be\nneither.) \n\nFor his part, Russell (1957) argued that, despite Strawson’s\nprotestations, the sentence was in fact false: \n\nDoes this whole debate come down to a case of intuition swapping?\nThomason (1990; 327) and Soames (1976; 169) seemed to think so, and\nStrawson himself (1964) also came to doubt whether the entailment\nvs. presupposition debate could be settled by “brisk little\nformal argument[s]”. However, Neale (1990) maintained that the\nmatter could be settled in Russell’s favor, and supported the claim by\ncollecting a number of previously observed cases in which intuitions\nabout truth conditions clearly do not support Strawson’s view. For\nexample, ‘My mother is dating the present king of France’\nseems clearly false, as does ‘The present king of France cleans\nmy swimming pool’, and he concluded that these are clearly cases\nwhere the Strawsonian truth conditions have gone awry. \n\nBut truth value judgments for cases like this are extremely\nsensitive. Lasersohn (1993), von Fintel (2004), Yablo (2006, 2009) and\nSchoubye (2009, 2011) have collected a number of examples where subtle\nchanges to the example give rise to different judgments of truth\nvalue. Consider the following minimal pairs, where the examples marked\nwith ‘#’ indicate ambivalence about assigning a truth\nvalue, and ‘F’ indicates it is more plausible to assign a\nvalue of falsehood. \n\nVon Fintel and Yablo offer an explanation for these minimal pairs\nthat draws upon the nature of belief revision. Their idea is that\nthe false presupposition is added to the evaluator’s set of\nbeliefs and is tested against that set of beliefs. So, if we test\n‘The king of France read Anna Karenina’ against a typical\nset of beliefs, there is no clash with existing beliefs. But if\nwe test ‘The king of France wrote Anna Karenina’\nagainst this set of beliefs, we get a clash. These are the cases\nwhere we judge the sentence false. \n\nSchoubye (2009, 2011) has argued that the von Fintel/Yablo story\nfails in key places, in particular with cases where there is no\npreviously existing conflicting belief. We typically believe that\nAnna Karenina was written by Tolstoy, who was not and is not\nthe king of France, but do we really have a belief in which the king of\nFrance was not a bald Nazi? Where would that belief come\nfrom? A general belief that royals can’t be Nazis? \nThat seems implausible. \n\nMore significantly, Schoubye observes that with some modest\ncontextual framing the truth value judgments on these examples can\nflip. In other words, we don’t even need to change the\nexample sentences. Suppose, for example, that someone says that\nall the royalty at a party are standing and someone utters ‘The present\nking of France is sitting in a chair’. Here Schoubye\nsuggests that our truth value judgments firm up and flip from being\nindeterminate to being clear judgments of falsity. \n\nSchoubye’s positive proposal is that the divergent judgments about\ntruth conditions key off of whether a speaker’s utterance can be\ninterpreted as being cooperative. Here Schoubye draws on Robert’s\n(1998, 2004) idea of the “topic under discussion.” In the\nexample just given, where we are talking about who is sitting at a\nparticular party, someone who utters (35a) is being an uncooperative\ndiscourse partner, in that they are not addressing the topic under\ndiscussion. The literature on presuppositional accounts of definite\ndescriptions has become vast, although not entirely uniform in its\ncriticism of Russellian doctrine.  Earlier, we noted that on Russell’s\nview definite descriptions pack within them an existence claim, a\nuniqueness claim, and a maximality claim.  Different presuppositional\naccounts have targeted different parts of this package, arguing that\nthe relevant component is not entailed but is presupposed. For example, begining with Strawson and the work cited above, we\nhave numerous writers arguing that the existence claim is\npresupposed. The idea that uniqueness is presupposed is suggested in\nwork by Heim (1991), von Fintel (2004), Elbourne (2005, 2013),\nRothschild (2007), and Schoubye (2013).  It is possible to understand\nCooper (1983), Heim (1983), Chemla (2009), Schlenker (2008, 2009) and\nRomoli (2015) as holding that the maximality component is presupposed.\nCombinations are possible. The idea that both the existence claim and\nthe uniqueness claim is presupposed can be attributed to Abbott\n(2008), Hawthorne and Manley (2012) and Schoubye (2013), among\nothers. \n\nDonnellan (1966) observed that there is a sense in which Strawson and\nRussell are both right (and both wrong) about the proper analysis of\ndescriptions. He argued that definite descriptions can be used in (at\nleast) two different ways. On a so-called attributive use, a sentence\nof the form ‘The F is G’ is used to express\na proposition equivalent to ‘Whatever is uniquely F is\nG’. For example, on seeing murder victim Smith’s badly\nmutilated corpse, Detective Brown might say “The murderer of\nSmith is insane” thereby communicating the thought that some\nunique individual murdered Smith and that whoever that individual is,\nhe/she is insane. Alternatively, on a referential use, a sentence of\nthe form ‘The F is G’ is used to pick out a\nspecific individual, x, and say of x that x is\nG. For example, suppose Jones is on trial for Smith’s murder\nand is behaving quite strangely at the defense table. I point at Jones\nand say, “The murderer of Smith is insane”, thereby\ncommunicating the thought that Jones is insane (whether or not Jones\nis the actual murderer).  Donnellan suggested that Russell’s quantificational account of\ndefinite descriptions might capture attributive uses, but that it does\nnot work for referential uses. In effect, we might take Donnellan as\nsaying that in some cases descriptions are Russellian and in some\ncases they are Strawsonian. Perhaps we could even say that the\ndefinite determiner ‘the’ is ambiguous between these two\ncases (it is not clear whether Donnellan himself intended to endorse a\nlexical ambiguity of this sort). \n\nKripke (1977) responded to Donnellan by arguing that the Russellian\naccount of definite descriptions could, by itself, account for both\nreferential and attributive uses; the difference between the two cases\ncould be entirely a matter of pragmatics. Here is the idea: Grice\nshowed us that there is an important distinction to be made between\nwhat one literally says by an utterance and what one intends to\ncommunicate (what one means) by that utterance. To take a famous\nexample of Grice’s, I might write a letter of recommendation for a\nstudent saying that he is very punctual and has excellent\nhandwriting. Now what I have said is something about the student’s\npunctuality and handwriting, but what I meant was that this is a very\nweak student. \n\nIn a similar vein, we could say that when I use a description\nreferentially—say in Donnellan’s courtroom case—I am\nliterally making a general claim to the effect that there is a\nmurderer of Smith and that he is insane, but what I mean by that\nutterance is that Jones is insane. That is, when I say ‘The\nmurderer of Smith insane’ what I literally say is that exactly\none person, x, is such that x murdered Smith and\nx is insane, but in that context I would succeed in\ncommunicating the singular proposition (about Jones) that Jones is\ninsane. Kripke gave several reasons for thinking that this Gricean\nsolution was preferable to an ambiguity thesis. One reason was a\ngeneral methodological point that one should not introduce ambiguities\nblithely—doing so is a kind of philosophical cheat.  Also, Kripke observed that these two uses of definite descriptions\nare really just subspecies of the general distinction between what is\nmeant (speaker’s reference in Kripke’s terminology) and what is\nliterally said (semantic reference) and not at all unique to\ndescriptions. Kripke noted that the distinction even applies to uses\nof proper names. So, for example, consider the case where I see a man\nin the distance raking leaves. I take the man to be Jones but it is\nactually Johnson. I say ‘Jones is really working up a sweat\ntoday’. Now what I have literally said is that Jones is working\nup a sweat, but what I have communicated (what I meant) is something\nabout Johnson. Clearly no one would argue that the name\n‘Jones’ is ambiguous between referring to Jones and\nreferring to Johnson, so why opt for an ambiguity thesis when\ndescriptions are involved? It appears to be exactly the same\nphenomenon.  One of the advantages of employing the Gricean distinction between\nthe proposition literally communicated and the proposition meant is\nthat it offers an account for our being ambivalent about Donnellan’s\n(1966) misdescription cases. In the courtroom case discussed above, I\nmight say “Smith’s murderer is insane,” and still say\nsomething true even if the crazy man at the defense table is entirely\ninnocent of the charges and the actual murderer, who is miles from the\ncourtroom, is quite sane. At the same time there is some pull to say\nthat in such a case one is saying something false too. We can say that\nthis is a case where what we literally said was false, but that what\nwe intended to communicate—the proposition meant—was\ntrue. The two-level theory thus accounts for our conflicting\nintuitions.  Similarly, Hornsby (1977) gave the case of my observing the man\nranting at the defense table and (me) saying, “The murderer of\nSmith is insane” not realizing that the man at the table is both\ninnocent and quite sane, while the actual murderer is at large and\nquite insane. Again we are ambivalent about the truth of what I say,\nand as Neale (1990; 91–93) observed, the distinction between the\nproposition literally expressed and the proposition meant allows us to\nunderstand why. In this case, the proposition literally expressed is\ntrue, but what I intend to communicate is mistaken. \n\nUnfortunately, there are cases where the two-stage theory doesn’t\nappear to be sufficient. For example, there remains a difficulty that\nLudlow and Segal (2004) have called the residue of the problem of\nmisdescription. Consider a case where we are at the crime scene,\nand unbeknownst to Detective Brown there is not one murderer but\nseveral—suppose there were several perpetrators and they were\nall mad members of an evil cult. When Brown utters the sentence\n‘The murderer of Smith is insane’ has he said something\ntrue or false? Again we are in two minds about the matter but this\ntime the distinction between what is literally said and what is meant\nis no help.  Another persistent problem for the classical Russellian theory of\ndescriptions has been the charge that it fails to account for the\nproblem of “incomplete descriptions” (for discussion see\nDonnellan (1968), Hornsby (1977), Devitt (1981, chapter 2; 2004),\nWettstein (1981), Recanati (1986), Salmon (1982), Soames (1986), Neale\n(1990; chapter 2), and Reimer (1992)). In addition, Kripke (1977),\nwhile defending Russell’s theory of description against the problem of\nmisdescription, allows that the argument from incomplete descriptions\nmight be enough of a problem to force us to accept referential\ninterpretations of descriptions. The worry, initially raised in\nStrawson (1950), is that if I say ‘the table is covered with\nbooks’, I do not mean to be suggesting that there is only one\ntable in the world. Unfortunately, that seems to be precisely what the\nRussellian theory of descriptions is committed to. (Recall that on the\nRussellian analysis my utterance is shorthand for ‘there is a\ntable and only one table and every table is covered with\nbooks’.)  One strategy for dealing with this problem is that the context may\nprovide us the means to flesh out the description. For example,\nperhaps descriptions can be fleshed out appropriately if we allow\nimplicit spatiotemporal locating expressions to be inserted into the\ndescription. The suggestion is that when we speak of the table we are\nimplicitly specifying a spatial coordinate—in effect, we are\nsaying ‘the table over there’. One problem with strategies\nof this nature is that there fails to be a principled basis (in the\nterminology of Devitt and Sterelny (1999)) for determining what the\ncontent of these descriptions is to be. Is it to be a description that\nthe speaker has in mind? Is this description really sufficient to\nuniquely identify the object in question? Is it always clear that the\nspeaker has a description in mind?  Neale (1990) has argued that whatever we may want to say about the\nproblem of incompleteness, it is not very effective as an argument for\nthe referential analysis of descriptions. For example, at the crime\nscene Detective Brown may simply utter ‘The murderer is\ninsane’ failing to specify exactly which murderer he is talking\nabout (is it the murderer of Smith or Jones or …?). But by\nhypothesis this case is a canonical example of an attributive use of a\ndefinite description. No reference is possible, so how can appeal to\nreference bail us out? How can any of this be an argument for definite\ndescriptions being semantically referential?  \n\nEven stronger, it appears that there are numerous examples\ninvolving quantified expressions that suffer the same fate as\nincomplete descriptions. I can say ‘Everyone came to the\nparty’, not intending to mean everyone in the world. Or I might\nsay, as Yogi Berra once did, ‘Nobody goes there anymore, it’s\ntoo crowded’. It certainly appears that what is going on in\nthese cases is similar to the cases of incomplete definite\ndescriptions and that there should be a single strategy for accounting\nfor these different cases of “incompleteness.” \n\nDevitt (2004, 2007) and Reimer (1998) have argued that these cases are\ngenuinely different in kind. Their idea is that since definite\ndescriptions are regularly used to express singular thoughts, it\nstands to reason that the standard meaning of the definite description\nmust be referential. Schoubye (2011, ch. 3) has responded to this claim arguing that it\nrests on mistaken assumptions about semantic processing and that in\nany case the line of reasoning would generalize so as to force a\nreferential interpretation of most (possibly all) the other\ndeterminers (e.g. ‘every’ and ‘no’).  Alternatively, some writers have argued that that the problem of\nincomplete definite descriptions can be accounted for if we pursue an\nappropriate theory of quantifier domain restriction. Stanley and\nSzabó (2000), for example, take this approach, suggesting that\ncontext can restrict the domain of quantification. On their proposal,\ncontext can even shift within a sentence, allowing us to make sense of\nan utterance like ‘The dogs barked at the dogs’, where I\nmean to say that one group of dogs barked while the other group\nperhaps suffered in silence. (Their proposal is applicable to all\nquantified expressions; not just the theory of descriptions.  See Bach\n(2000), Neale (2000b), and Lepore (2004) for a more general dicussion\nof the proposal.) \n\nIt is important to note (following Szabó (2000) and Ludlow and Segal\n(2004) that even with a fully functional account of quantifier domain\nrestriction there is a lingering problem here too. Let’s call it the\nresidue of the incompleteness problem. Consider cases like (38) \n\nOn the domain restriction proposal, the first use of ‘the book’ cannot have the\nsame domain of quantification as the second use, since that would put\ntwo books in the domain of quantification and it would mean that both\ndescriptions in the sentence are incomplete. But one wonders how legitimate\na domain-shift analysis is here. Is there really a shift in the domain\nof quantification between the first utterance of ‘the book’\nand the second utterance of that noun phrase? What would count as\nindependent evidence either for, or against, a domain-shift taking\nplace? \n\nAs noted in the beginning of this article, the Russellian account of\ndescriptions not only offers a quantificational as opposed to a\nreferential account of descriptions, but it packs three different\nclaims into the analysis of descriptions: an existence claim,\na uniqueness claim, and a maximality claim. As we\nwill see, all of these claims can be put under pressure, and all three\narguably collapse under that pressure. Let’s begin by examining the\nuniqueness claim.  Given the Gricean resources discussed above, one might speculate\nthat the distinction between definite and indefinite descriptions can\nbe collapsed—that is, perhaps ‘the’ and\n‘a’ have the same literal meaning and the only relevant\ndistinction between them is pragmatic. \n\nThe motivation for this idea would be as follows. Very few natural\nlanguages have what we would recognize as definite and indefinite\ndescriptions. In most Asian and Slavic languages, for example,\n‘the man’ and ‘a man’ would both be expressed\nin the same way—in the determiner-free equivalent of\n‘man’. Perhaps it is just our infatuation with surface\ngrammatical form that leads us to think that English or Italian really\nhas two different logical elements corresponding to surface forms\n‘the’ and ‘a’. Perhaps there is a single\nlogical element (or perhaps just a free variable) with different\npragmatic application conditions. That is, perhaps ‘the’\nand ‘a’ have the same literal meaning—i.e., for both\n‘An F is G’ and ‘The F is\nG’ the literal semantics is exhausted by the\ninterpretation that [∃x: Fx](Gx) receives\nin a standard truth-conditional semantics. A number of linguists and\nphilosophers have entertained this idea in recent years, including\nKempson (1975), Breheney (1999), Szabó (2000), Zvolensky (1997),\nLudlow and Segal (2003) and a version of the idea is at least\nconsidered in Heim (1982) and Kamp and Reyle (1993).  Obviously there are important differences between our application\nof the terms ‘the’ and ‘a’, but it does not\nfollow that these differences in application are part of their\nsemantical content. Indeed, many synonyms customarily are put to\ndifferent uses. Take, for example, Grice (1961, 1975) on the\ndistinction between ‘but’ and ‘and’. On\nGrice’s story ‘but’ and ‘and’ literally mean\nthe same thing, but different “conventional implicatures”\nare associated with them; ‘but’ implicates a sense of\ncontrast between the conjuncts. \n\nLudlow and Segal (2004) offer a similar story about ‘a’\nand ‘the’. Following a standard assumption in traditional\ngrammar (see Christophersen 1929), they argue that\n‘the’ signals that the object under discussion is given in\nthe conversational context. Noun phrases fronted by the determiner\n‘a’ signal that they involve new information. The idea\nadvanced by Ludlow and Segal, however, is that this slender bit of\ninformation, combined with Gricean principles, is sufficient to\ngenerate the uniqueness implication that is carried by a definite\ndescription. That is, an existential claim that there is an F\nthat is G, plus a signal that this is given information, is often\nenough to allow us to implicate that there is unique F that is\nG.  Armed with this idea, let’s return to the some of the loose\nthreads that we left hanging in section 4 above—the residue of\nthe misdescription problem and the residue of the incompleteness\nproblem. As we will see, the unified treatment of definite and\nindefinite descriptions may provide us an entering wedge for cracking\nopen these puzzles. Let’s look at the misdescription case first. \n\nRecall the case in which Detective Brown says ‘the murderer of\nSmith is insane’, incorrectly believing that there was one\nmurderer when in fact the crime was committed by a ghoulish cult of\ninsane individuals. There is a sense in which Brown spoke falsely, but\nthere is also clearly some pull for us to say that what he said was\ntrue. As we saw in section 4, the distinction between the proposition\nliterally expressed and the proposition meant was not sufficient to\naccount for this ambivalence on our part. But according to Ludlow and\nSegal (2004), if we combine this pragmatic distinction with the unified\nanalysis of definite and indefinite descriptions there is something we\ncan say about this last bit of residue. \n\nAccording to the unified analysis of descriptions, what Detective\nBrown literally expresses is not the idea that there was a unique\nmurderer of Smith who is insane. To the contrary, he literally\nexpresses the proposition that there is at least one murderer of Smith\nwho is insane. By applying Gricean principles in this context\nwe have made out that Brown intends to say that there is a unique\nmurderer of Smith and that he is insane. We are\npulled in two directions by this case because what Brown has said\nis literally true but what he intended to communicate was, strictly\nspeaking, false. \n\nIn section 5.3 we considered cases like (38), repeated here, which did not seem to\nyield in a natural way to the device of quantifier domain\nrestriction.  \n\nBut as Szabó (2000) and Ludlow and Segal (2003) have\nargued, if we combine quantifier domain restriction with the unified\nanalysis of descriptions, the problem seems more amenable to solution.\nThe idea is the following: What one literally expresses in (38) is\nthat the hearer should put a book on a book. Pragmatics helps us to\nmake out that one book in particular is being spoken of, which book\nthat is, and where it is to be moved. \n\nAlthough a unified approach is attractive, it has come under\ncriticism from Abbott (2003, 2008), Horn (2006) and Abbott and Horn (2011). \nFor example, Abbott (2008) argues that the \npragmatic story (in which the uniqueness of some descriptions is\nconversationally implicated) fails because it predicts that the\nuniqueness implication should be cancellable, but according to Abbott,\nit is not. (Here we use the hash symbol to indicate a failed implicature cancellation.) \n\nOne response to this line of argument is that it frontloads our\nassumptions about written works having single authors.  Is (40) any\nbetter? \nThis suggests that the uniqueness is not implicated by\n‘the’, but is rather built into the meaning of\n‘authored’. Strictly speaking, Russell isn’t an author,\nbut a co-author.  Contrast both with the following, which seems\nentirely natural. \n\nThis also raises the question of how far one can press the case\nbased on examples like (39). Should we also reject\nKripke’s pragmatic analysis of referential descriptions because\nof the infelicity of examples like (42)? \n\nAbbott and Horn have suggested that the use of stress in descriptions\nhighlights the uniqueness implications of the utterance. In\nparticular, they claim that in the case of focal stress on the\ndefinite, “only uniqueness is at issue with\nfocused the, never familiarity.” \nConsider the following examples from Horn (2006). (43) Graham claims that cancer selection is not\na but the driving\nforce in the emergence of complex animal life. (44)  an idea that the EU is not\nA but THE form of\nregional integration. (45) Yet time and again, North Korea is cited as not only\n“a” but “the” major threat to US\nsecurity. (46) So Lufthansa is a—or even the—German\nairline. \nSetting aside the question of whether these examples offer a case\nagainst familiarity, they are not, by themselves, evidence for\nuniqueness. For example, if (46) is asserting that there is a single\nunique German airline, it is clearly false, as there are many other\nGerman airlines, including Germanwings, Air Berlin, Germania, Hahn\nAir, and Air Hamburg.  Abbot (1999, 2008) recognizes that cases like\nthis are false, but argues that what is going on is that the speakers\nare engaged in hyperbole.  That is, in (46) the speaker is literally\nsaying there is only one German airline and we recognize this as an\nintentional falsehood, and then infer that the speaker means to\ncommunicate the airline is special in some way.  The alternative, of\ncourse, is to hold that the stressed definite determiner is indicating\nfamiliarity or salience. Uniqueness accounts also must account for cases in which uniqueness\nappears to vanish altogether. Consider (47).  In a similar vein it is hard to overlook the fact that possessives\nin languages like Italian typically deploy definite determiners\n(‘la mia machina’) without forcing the reading that I own\nonly one car. \n\nCases of this nature have of course been familiar for some time, but\nperhaps it has been less on the radar that the uniqueness proposal\ncreates foundational problems for language acquisition theory. It is\nsomething of a basic working hypothesis of acquisition theory that\nsemantical components of language are acquired very early and that\npragmatic components are acquired much later (see Chien and Wexler\n(1990), Thornton and Wexler (2000)). This is not surprising, given\nthat pragmatics can involve sophisticated real world\nreasoning. However, children’s grasp of definite and indefinite\ndescriptions come late in the acquisition process (around age 9; see\nKarmiloff-Smith 1979 and Warden 1976)), prompting Wexler (2011),\nworking on hypothesis that descriptions are Russellian, to question\nthe working hypothesis that semantics is fixed early. But an\nalternative explanation is that uniqueness is a pragmatic phenomenon,\nthus saving the working hypothesis. In other words, a basic working\nhypothesis of acquisition theory is preserved if we reject the\nRussellian story about the distinction between definite and indefinite\ndeterminers. So far we have been talking about the unified theory in the context\nof rejecting the uniqueness component of Russell’s analysis. But there\nare also the existence component and the maximality component to\nconsider. Can these also be rejected? \nA number of authors have observed that the traditional Russellian\nanalysis of definite descriptions gets us into trouble when we embed\ndescriptions into certain environments like propositional attitudes,\nconditionals, and questions (see Heim (1991) Elbourne (2005, 2010,\n2013, forthcoming), Neale (2005), Rothschild (2007), Hawthorne and\nManley (2012) and Schoubye (2011, 2013)). To illustrate the problem,\nconsider the following: (48)  John wants the ghost in the attic to stop making so much\nnoise. (49) John wants that there be exactly one ghost in the attic and\nthat it stop making so much noise. On the standard Russellian analysis, we get something like a claim\nthat John wants that there be a unique ghost in his attic and that it\nstop making so much noise. Let’s set aside the uniqueness\nclaim for the moment and just focus on the existence claim; is it\nreally the case that John wants there to be a ghost in the attic at\nall? Notice that it won’t do to try and extract the\nexistence claim from the propositional attitude environment, for then\nwe get an actual existence claim, which is definitely not what we\nwant. As Rothchild (2007) observes, a similar argument can be made for\ndescriptions embedded in questions (here assuming, as did Russell,\nthat possessives are to be analyzed as definite descriptions): (50)  Is my child making too much noise? (51) Is it the case that I have exactly one child and that it is making too much noise? \nClearly, the question being put forth in (50) is not concerned with\nfinding out whether or not the questioner has a child.  Responding by\nsaying ‘yes you have a child’ would not be a partial\nanswer to the question.  The phenomenon also seems to apply to modal adverbs.  Consider the\ncase where I do not know if my upstairs neighbors have a child, but I\nspeculate that they do and that it is making noise.  It would be odd\nfor me to offer up an utterance of (52), even though (53) would be\nfine. (52) It is possible that the child of my upstairs neighbors is\nmaking noise. (53) It is possible that there is exactly one child of my upstairs\nneighbors and it is making noise. (54) It is necessary that my identical twin has my DNA. (55) It is necessary that there is exactly one identical twin of me\nand that it have my DNA. \nElbourne (forthcoming) believes that the problem can even be\nconstructed in cases that are extensional if we quantify into the\ndescription.  Consider the following. (56) No boy sold the dog he bought. (57) No boy bought exactly one dog and sold it. \nThere are circumstances in which the Russellian gloss in (57) is true,\nbut (56) is not true.  For example, the case in which no boys bought\nany dogs. \nSchoubye’s (2011) solution to all these cases bears notice.  He argues\nthat the problem can be avoided if we distinguish between the sentence\nitself, the presupposition, and what is asserted. So, for example, for\na sentence like ‘The F is\nG’ we have the following: \nSo, as in the Ludlow and Segal analysis, the uniqueness claim is not\npart of what is asserted. On Schoubye’s proposal, uniqueness is not\nimplicated, but is presupposed. But notice also that in this case the\nexistence claim is also not part of what is asserted. What is asserted\nis simply an open sentence! In some cases, the open sentence will be\nexistentially closed, but in cases like ‘John wants the ghost in\nthe attic to be quiet’ there is no existential closure. Of\ncourse it is possible to ask what it means to assert an open sentence,\nbut notice that again we are converging on a view in which the\ndeterminers fall out, leaving behind a free variable.  We’ve already put the uniqueness and existence claims of\ndescriptions under pressure. Can we do the same with the maximality\nclaim? Here it is difficult to find evidence one way or the other for\nthe case of singular definite descriptions, but earlier we saw that\nthe theory could be generalized à la Sharvy,\nto plural descriptions, and in the plural case we could actually probe\nthe question of whether maximality holds. \n\nRecall from section 4.4 that on the Sharvy (1980) analysis of\ndescriptions we could generalize Russell’s theory of descriptions to\nplurals by arguing that ‘the F (or Fs) is (are)\nG’ is equivalent to the following, \n\n(again, where F can be either a singular count noun (like\n‘dog’), a plural count noun (like ‘dogs’) or a\nmass noun (like ‘water’), and the symbol ‘≤’\nindicates a parthood relation.) \n\nOf interest to us at the moment is the fact that this analysis encodes\nthe maximality claim—it says that all the Fs are Gs. But\nis this analysis right? Arguably not. If one says the American people\nare disappointed in Trump, it doesn’t mean that all of them are. If my\nneighbor has 101 Dalmatians, I might complain ‘the dogs are\nbarking again’, even if only some of them are barking (and it\ndoesn’t seem plausible to say that I am restricting the domain of\ndiscourse to just the 20 or so dogs that are barking). Likewise for\ndefinite mass terms; if I say that the bread in the breadbox is moldy\nI am not saying that the bread is moldy through and through—I’m\nsaying that some of it is. And if I say that ‘the dog is a loyal\nanimal’ I am not saying that all subspecies of dogs are\nloyal. Arguably the maximality condition in Sharvy’s generalized\ntheory of descriptions should be dropped altogether. (But see Brogaard\n(2007) and Bach (2004) for defenses of maximality.) \n\nIt seems that all three components of Russell’s analysis face serious\nchallenges. At this point, is there anything left to salvage?  \n\nAt the beginning of this article I noted that some uses of the\nexpressions ‘an F’ and ‘the F’\nare argued to be predicational, rather than quantificational. So, for\nexample, consider the following cases. (60) John is a lawyer. (61) John is the mayor of Pittsburgh. \n\nIt is not unusual to think of ‘is a lawyer’ and\n‘is the mayor of Pittsburgh’ as predicates. In the case of\n(60), we intuitively are not saying that there is a lawyer such that\nJohn is identical to that lawyer. Indeed, as Williams (1983) observed,\nthis appearance is even more pronounced if we consider cases like\n(62). \n\n(62) does not seem to have the meaning that there is a\nlawyer such that John is not identical to that lawyer. It is more\nnatural to take an utterance of (62) as denying that John has a certain\nproperty. \n\nIf this is right, then the copula ‘is’ is really just\nthe ‘is’ of predication and semantically dispensable\n(significantly, it routinely does not appear in many other languages\nunless it is needed to carry tense or other inflectional information).\nLikewise, we might say that the indefinite article ‘a’ is\nsemantically inert as well—a mere “grace note” in\nHigginbotham’s (1987) terminology. In this vein, one widely held view,\ndue to Kamp (1981) and Heim (1982), is that we could regard indefinite\ndescriptions as expressions containing free variables which are bound\nby adverbs of quantification (in the sense of Lewis (1975)) interpreted\nas existentially quantified by the model theory, or perhaps bound by\nimplicit existential closure operators (Diesing 1992). \n\nFor linguists it is now standard to think of indefinite descriptions\nfollowing the copula as always being predicational, and it is a\nwidespread belief that definite descriptions following the copula are\noften predicational. Philosophers have also been attracted to this\nview. See, for example, Geach (1962; section 39), Wiggins\n(1965, 42 ff.), Kim (1970; 211 ff.), Wilson (1978), Smiley (1981) and\nHigginbotham (1987) among others). Does it follow that we must admit\ntwo different kinds of descriptions (quantificational and\npredicational)? We saw that singular, plural, mass, and generic\ndescriptions can be unified; can we perform the same unification trick\nhere? \n\nFara (2001) pursued the possibility that all uses of definite\ndescriptions are predicational—even descriptions in subject\nposition. The idea is that if I say ‘The present King of France\nis bald’, I am saying something like the following:\nsome x is such that x is the unique present king of\nFrance and x is bald. The interesting riff here is the notion\nthat the uniqueness condition is built into the predicate. Extending\nthe Sharvy (1980) analysis of plural descriptions, we get the\nfollowing, where F is the set of all Fs, or the mass of\nall substance that is F (the vertical strokes before ad after\nand after the expression indicate that we are talking about the\nsemantic value, or meaning, of the bordered expression):  But again we might consider collapsing the distinction between\ndefinite and indefinite descriptions here, and say that there is a\nsingle rule that interprets all descriptions—definite,\nindefinite, singular, plural, mass, or generic—as\npredicates. When we supplement this with the rejection of the\nuniqueness/maximality clause we get this result: \n\nIf this is right then the determiners ‘a’ and\n‘the’ are both “grace notes” not just in\nspecial positions, but across the board. \nWhat then are we to say about the determiners ‘the’ and\n‘a’? Determiners are rare in the world’s languages and are\nnot universally employed in many Indo-European languages (for example\nthey are not found in Slavic languages, with the exception of southern\nSlavic languages like Bulgarian). And (as we saw above) even in\nlanguages that deploy determiners, it is not clear that the\ndeterminers are behaving as quantificational operators.  \nOne interesting fact to observe here, is that as noted by Hewson\n(1972; 66–67) languages with articles and languages with robust\ncase morphology are typically in complementary distribution.  Indeed,\nas languages evolve, their robust inflectional system gives way to\nstructure dependent language (Leiss (2000)).  It is when the case\nsystem weakens that determiners begin to appear––an idea\nthat is offered in Abraham (1997:29), Philippi (1997:63–64),\nSelig (1992), Ivančev 1988:105, and (Mayer 1988: 112).  As Mladenova\n(2007) puts it, “the morphology of the definite article makes it\npossible to perpetuate case distinctions long after they have been\nobliterated elsewhere.” (But see also Mladenova for subtleties\nin applying this idea to Bulgarian.)  Could it be then that\ndeterminers serve the purpose of case marking?   This question calls for an ambitious empirical research program,\nbut we can already see hints of an analysis. For example, it is\nplausible to think that one central function of the definite\ndeterminer is to provide genitive case when needed.  In some cases\nthis would yield a possessive meaning. Consider the following\nexamples. (64)  The car went in the ditch. (65)  I was such a terrible bowler that the ball went in the\ngutter. (66)  The car needs gas. (67)  The doctor told me to stop eating red meat. \n\nIt is easy to hear all of these examples as involving an implicit\npossessive operator. (64′)  The car went in the road’s\nditch. (65′)  I was such a terrible bowler that my ball\nwent in my lane’s gutter. (66′)  Our car needs gas. (67′)  My doctor told me to stop eating red\nmeat. \n\nExample (65) is particularly instructive in this regard. If I am an\nexceptionally terrible bowler I might toss the ball into the gutter of\nsomeone else’s lane. In this case I might be more apt to say\n“The ball went in a gutter”; saying that it went\nin the gutter doesn’t quite seem to do justice to my failure as a\nbowler. That is because when I say the ball went in the\ngutter it suggests that it at least ended up in my\ngutter. The claim, however, is not that the definite determiner is\nfunctioning as a possessive. The hypothesis is that it is functioning\nas a multi-purpose case marker, and when it is marking for genitive\ncase, possessive meaning is one possible outcome.  But genitive case\ncan be put to other uses. For example, species names are routinely\ngiven in the genitive case in Latin, and indeed it is a prescriptive\nrule about the coining of a new species name that it be placed in\ngenitive case.  The underlying deep motivation is presumably that\nspecies are part of a genus, so that when one expresses a species name\nit is shorthand for a more complete description.  So, for example,\nwhen we say ‘The tiger’, we are offering up an abbreviation of\nsomething like ‘tiger, species of genus panthera’ (or more accurately,\n‘panthera tigris, of genus panther’).  One might here argue that this\nis a partitive construction, but more explicit possessive\nconstructions are possible: ‘species panthera tigris, belonging to the\ngenus panthera’. \nThis genitive case analysis perhaps sheds light on what is going on in\nthe array of facts offered by Abbott and Horn.  Consider (46) again.\n\n (46) So Lufthansa is a—or even the—German\nairline. \nAs observed earlier, (46) can be asserted even if there is more than\none German airline.  One intriguing possibility here is that the\nstress is creating what is known as a superlative genitive,\nan example from Latin being sanctum sanctorum (holy of\nholies).  In the case of (46), for example, we are saying Lufthansa is\nthe most German airline of German airlines.  This story would require\na story involving some movement and copying of the noun within the\ndeterminer phrase, but such a story would not be unheard of in\ncontemporary work on the structure of determiner phrases (see Larson\n(2014)). \nWhat is also intriguing about this line of inquiry is that it suggests\na new strategy for accounting for definiteness.  It is not\npragmatically extruded from givenness (as suggested by Ludlow and\nSegal) but rather from whatever meaning the genetive case brings with\nit – often some notion of possession.  For example, an appearance of\na description of the form ‘the dog’ in a sentence might\nindicate something like ‘dog of the event’ or ‘dog\nbearing some thematic role to the event’.  From this bit of\ninformation, the pragmatics might allow us infer that there is a\nunique dog. It would not be fruitful to suggest that definite determiners\nalways play the role of case assignment, and they most\ncertainly cannot be cashed out as exclusively assigning genitive\ncase. The prospects for a unified explanation for determiner behavior\nseems remote. The evidence does suggest however, that definite\ndeterminers can often play the role of supplying case, and this may go\na long way towards explaining some of the most recalcitrant facts\ninvolving descriptions. \n\nA close study of the syntax and semantics of natural language suggests\nthat constructions of the form ‘the F’ and\n‘an F’ are not only rare in natural languages, but\npotentially misleading in languages like English. These expressions\nreally don’t carry out the logical roles that Russell and subsequent\nauthors have thought. However, Russell’s core insight remains intact:\nThe critical question is whether the sentences in which they appear\nare quantificational or referential, and Russell may well be right\nabout the critical cases here.  That is, many apparently referential\nconstructions may in fact be quantificational. What Russell didn’t see\nwas that surface grammar is more deceptive than even he\nrealized. Elements like ‘the’ and ‘a’ do not\ndirectly encode quantifiers or uniqueness clauses. The task for\nphilosophers of language now is the thorny task of figuring\nout what information they do encode.
