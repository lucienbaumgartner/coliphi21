He participated in\nthe Quarrel of the Ancients and Moderns, wrote on numismatics, delved\ninto a variety of historical questions, and had an enduring love of\nthe fine arts. Today he is primarily known as the author\nof Critical Reflections on Poetry and Painting (1719) and as\none of the founders of modern aesthetics. Deeply influenced by his\nfriend John Locke, Du Bos made a major contribution to the spread of\nempiricism in France, both in aesthetics and other areas of\nphilosophy. He influenced almost all eighteenth-century contributors\nto aesthetics, including Charles Batteux, Alexander Gottlieb\nBaumgarten, David Hume, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Moses Mendelssohn,\nand Jean Jacques Rousseau.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDu Bos was born in Beauvais on 14 December 1670. Little is known of\nhis family or childhood. He was educated in Paris, where he received a\nMaster of Arts in 1688 and a Bachelor of Theology in 1692. Although\nlater in life he was a titular abbé and canon, he seems to have\nhad little interest in the ecclesiastical life. He was more interested\nin politics and in the life of a man of letters and he soon moved in\nleading intellectual circles. His friends included Nicolas\nBoileau-Déspreaux, an important poet and literary critic,\nCharles Perrault, another major poet, and Pierre Bayle, the famous\nphilosopher. He was a friend of Jean Jacques Rousseau though, as was\noften the case with Rousseau’s friendships, the friendship did\nnot endure. Du Bos was particularly closely associated with Bayle, who\nhad an important impact on Du Bos’s thought. Du Bos traveled\nextensively in Europe in his capacity as a diplomat and in order to\nmeet the leading intellectuals of the day. Lombard 1913 remains the\nstandard account of his life. \n\nDu Bos’s first book was Histoire de Quatre Gordiens,\nprouvée et illustrée par les Médailles\n(History of the Four Gordians, proven and illustrated by\nmedallions) (1695). In this work, he argued, on the basis of\nnumismatic evidence, that there had been four, not three Gordian\nemperors. His hypothesis was quickly refuted by historians. \n\nDu Bos worked as a diplomat and was involved in negotiating a peace\ntreaty between the Netherlands and France. In this connection, he\nwrote\nLes Interests de l’Angleterre mal entendus dans la guerre\nprésente (England’s Interests in the Present War\nMisunderstood) (1703). \n\nHis next book was L’Histoire de la Ligue de\nCambray (History of the League of Cambrai). This was a\nclear and engaging history of the alliance, including France,\nassembled by Pope Julius II to wage war against the Venetian Republic\nbetween 1508 and 1516. The book was praised by, among others,\nVoltaire. \n\nDu Bos travelled to England in 1698 to meet John Locke at the request\nof their mutual friend Nicolas Toinard. Toinard wanted advice on the\npreparation of a translation of Locke’s Essay concerning\nHuman Understanding. Locke and Du Bos became close friends and\nLocke asked his French friend to review the French translation of\nthe Essay. The influence of Locke’s empiricism is\nevident throughout the Critical Reflections. \n\nIn 1719 Du Bos published Réflexions critiques sur la\npoésie et sur la peinture (Critical Reflections on\nPoetry and Painting), the book on which his posthumous reputation\ndepends. Further editions appeared in 1732, 1733, 1740, 1746, 1755,\n1760, and 1770. The work was significantly expanded and revised for\nthe 1740 and subsequent editions. It was translated into German,\nDutch, and English. Largely on the basis of the Critical\nReflections, Du Bos was elected to the Académie\nfrançaise in 1720. He became perpetual secretary of the\nAcadémie in 1723. \n\nDu Bos’s final major work was the Histoire critique de\nl’établissement de la monarchie française dans les\nGaules (Critical History of the Establishment of the French\nMonarchy in Gaul) (1734). The book’s thesis is that the\nFranks did not conquer Gaul. Rather, according to Du Bos, the Gauls\ninvited them to become the rulers of what became France. The book won\nthe praise of many, including Edward Gibbon, but it was effectively\ncriticized by Montesquieu in The Spirit of the Laws. \n\nBy all accounts, Du Bos was a pleasant and charming man. Many\naffectionate remembrances were published in the wake of his death on\n23 March 1742. \n\nCritical Reflections on Poetry and Painting begins with an\ninvestigation of the “striking pleasure (1.1)” that humans\nreceive from the experience of poetry and painting. (All references to\nthe Critical Reflections are by volume and chapter. These\nreferences will be correct for any edition from 1740 on.) The book\nfocuses on the two fine arts mentioned in the book’s title, but\nDu Bos also discusses sculpture, engraving, dance, and music.\nAccording to Du Bos, we receive pleasure from the fine arts because\nworks of art are imitations of objects in the world. Presumably, on Du\nBos’s view, the similarity between imitations and the objects\nimitated is responsible for the arousal of emotion. When we experience\nimitations, we receive emotions similar to, but less intense than, the\nemotions we feel when we experience the objects imitated. If these\nemotions are pleasing, Du Bos has an account of the pleasure that\nhumans receive from experience of the fine arts. \n\nDu Bos’s account of the striking pleasure that we receive from\nthe fine arts commits him to the ancient view that the fine arts are\nimitative arts. This view is traceable to Plato and Aristotle and Du\nBos acknowledges these ancient sources. Although the view that the\nfine arts make up a coherent ‘system’ is sometimes\nattributed to Charles Batteux (Kristeller 1951; 1952), Du Bos’s\nviews clearly anticipate those of Batteux (Young 2015). \n\nAccording to Du Bos, all arts are imitative, but the arts do not all\nrepresent in the same way. In the course of the Critical\nReflections, Du Bos makes a contribution to philosophy of\nlanguage by distinguishing between natural signs and the artificial\nsigns found in language. Natural signs, such as those found in\npainting, sculpture, and music, represent because they resemble their\nobjects. The artificial signs of language are arbitrary or\nconventional. They are employed in poetry (that is, literature). \n\nDu Bos asks which of the arts is best able to arouse emotions. He\nbelieves that painting has an advantage over poetry on the grounds\nthat natural signs affect us more effectively. He argues, however,\nthat poetry when combined with music or acting (or both, as in opera)\nhas an advantage over painting. \n\nDu Bos is aware that his account of the pleasure we receive from art\nfaces a serious objection. When the emotions we receive from viewing\nan imitation are positive, Du Bos’s account has a prima facie\nplausibility. Sometimes, however, as he recognizes, we receive\nunpleasant emotions from the experience of artistic imitations. Du Bos\nconsiders, for example, an imitation of the sacrifice of\nJephthah’s daughter and Le Brun’s painting, Massacre\nof the Innocents. These works arouse negative\nemotions. Nevertheless, we willingly, even enthusiastically,\nexperience the works. Our willingness to experience works that arouse\nnegative emotions is often referred to as the paradox of tragedy. \n\nDu Bos tries to resolve the paradox by making two points. He begins by\nsaying that, although imitations of unpleasant events will arouse\nunpleasant emotions, these emotions are not as intense or as enduring\nas we receive from experience of the events themselves. This point\ncannot, by itself, resolve the paradox. Du Bos’s second point is\nthat although the emotions aroused by imitations of unpleasant events\nare unpleasant, they are preferable to an emotion that we would\notherwise feel. According to Du Bos, we are constitutionally subject\nto a feeling of deep ennui. This ennui is not merely boredom. Rather\nit is a weariness of the human condition. \n\nIn ‘On Tragedy,’ Hume endorses Du Bos’s solution to\nthe paradox, at least up to a point. Hume notes that, according to Du\nBos, “nothing is in general so disagreeable to the mind as the\nlanguid, listless state of indolence, into which it falls upon the\nremoval of all passion and occupation.” Hume then adds that,\nwhen a work of tragic art arouses an emotion “Let it be\ndisagreeable, afflicting, melancholy, disordered; it is still better\nthan…insipid languor” (Hume 1757, 217). Some contemporary\nphilosophers have also found merit in Du Bos’s approach to the\nparadox of tragedy (Livingston 2013). \n\nLater in the Critical Reflections Du Bos returns to the\nparadox of tragedy and gives a rather different solution. This later\npassage is apparently influenced by Aristotle’s Poetics\nsince Du Bos speaks of the purging of emotions. He means by this,\nhowever, something other than Aristotle meant. According to Du Bos,\n“The faithful depiction of the passions suffices to make us\nafraid and make us resolve to avoid them with all of the determination\nof which we are capable” (1.44). For example, we watch a\nperformance of Medea and we are horrified by the passion for\nvengeance and resolve not to indulge in it. \n\nThe concept of sentiments is crucial to Du Bos’s thought. He\nseems to have been the writer who made talk of sentiments so\ncommonplace in eighteenth-century aesthetics. Du Bos never precisely\ndefines what he means when he speaks of sentiments. In what is,\nperhaps, the closest he comes to a definition he writes that,\n“The first ideas born in the soul, when it receives a lively\nstimulus,…we call sentiments” (1.33). According\nto Du Bos, sentiments are not produced by a special sort of aesthetic\nexperience. Rather, they are, as already indicated, ordinary emotional\nresponses. We can receive sentiments from experience of ordinary\nobjects and from experience of the imitations found in art. The\ndifference, as already noted, is that sentiments produced by art are\nfainter. \n\nDespite believing that sentiments are ordinary emotions or fainter\ncopies of them, Du Bos posits a sense of beauty. He writes that,\n“We have in us a sense intended to judge the value of works that\nimitate touching objects in nature” and calls this a\n“sixth sense” (2.22). Du Bos compares the sense of beauty\nto gustatory taste and seems to have been among the first writers to\ndo so. \n\nSince artistic imitations are intended to arouse emotions similar to\nthose aroused by the objects imitated, Du Bos values what he calls\nvraisemblance (verisimilitude). Painters, for example, must\n“make a painting consistent with what we know of the customs,\nhabits, architecture, and arms of the people that one intends to\nrepresent” (1.30). A work can, however,\nbe vraisemblable without being an imitation of the real world\nand historical events. A work can be vraisemblable and yet be\nan example of what Du Bos calls “the marvelous”. An opera,\nfor example, can be\nvraisemblable even though it depicts marvelous ancient Greek\ngods and goddesses. It must, however, depict them as existing in a way\nthat gods and goddesses can exist. Vraisemblance is not an\nend in itself as it was for some earlier thinkers. The real goal of\nthe arts is to arouse sentiments and vraisemblance is only a\nmeans of doing so. \n\nAccording to Du Bos, we judge artworks by means of our sentiments\nrather than by means of reason. He rejects the rationalist school of\ncriticism associated with writers such as Roland Fréart de\nChambray (1606—76), the author of L’Idée de la\nperfection de la peinture demonstrée par les principles de\nl’art (1662) and Jean Terrasson, whose work\nDissertation critique sur l’Iliade d’Homere\nappeared in 1715. Terrasson wrote that, “Any man who does not\nthink of any literary matter as Descartes prescribes to think about\nphysical matters, is not worthy of the present century …\nNothing prepares better than mathematics to properly judge works of\nwit” (Terrasson 1715, lxv). In a similar vein, Bosse wrote that\nthe “noble art of painting must be based for the most\npart on correct and rule-governed reasoning, which is to say,\ngeometrical and, consequently, demonstrative.” Du Bos mocks\nthese writers as ‘geometrical critics’. \n\nHe writes that the evaluation of art “is not left to reason. It\nmust submit to the judgement that sentiment pronounces. Sentiment is\nthe competent judge of this issue.” He goes on to compare the\nevaluation of an artwork to making a judgement about a ragout. Reason\nis of no use here. Rather, “We taste the ragout and…we\nknow that it is good. It is the same with works of wit and pictures\nmade to please us by touching us” (1.22). \n\nIn making sentiments the means by which artworks are judged, Du Bos\ngave rise to a question that he did not fully appreciate and certainly\ndid not solve. This is the question of providing a standard of taste.\nDu Bos is a subjectivist. He makes the value of an artwork a\nresponse-dependent property. A work of art is valuable if it arouses\ncertain valuable sentiments in audience members. Du Bos was aware that\ndifferent works will arouse different pleasing sentiments in different\npeople: \n\nThe problem, as Hume clearly recognized, was that not everyone\nreceives the same sentiments from a work of art. This leads to the\nconclusion that a work has value for some people and not for others.\nHowever, as Hume also recognized, thorough-going subjectivism is\ncounterintuitive. It seems that there is a fact that Milton is a\ngreater poet than Ogilby, even if some people prefer Ogilby. \n\nDu Bos was unaware of the full extent of the problem caused by\nsubjectivism. Likely this was because he believed that everyone has\nvery much the same sentiments. In fact, he believed that the general\npublic was the best judge of the value of artworks because their taste\nwas least corrupted by prejudice. \n\nDu Bos also proposes the test of time. When a work of art repeatedly\npleases audiences over a long period of time, this is conclusive\nevidence that it is a work of high value. Du Bos point out, for\nexample, that the reputations of the best Greek and Roman poets are\nfirmly established since they have pleased audiences through the\nages. \n\nSome writers, Du Bos was aware, believe that artworks can be valuable\nas a source of knowledge. At times Du Bos indicates that there is\nsomething to this, and that art is valuable as more than the source of\nvaluable sentiments. In the end, however, his considered opinion is\nthat, “We can acquire some knowledge by reading a poem, but this\nis scarcely the motive for opening the book” (1.34). \n\nDu Bos speaks about audience members’ states of mind but he also\nspeaks of the artist’s state of mind. Artists, he believes, feel\nthe emotions that their works arouse in audience members. Indeed, the\nartist’s “goal is to make us share his sentiments”\n(2.1). The difference between the artist’s state of mind, and\nthose of audience members, is that the artist’s sentiments are\nmore intense. Artists must be in a state of “enthusiasm”\nif they are to create successful works of art. This enthusiasm can\nborder on madness. Since Du Bos believes that artists convey their\nemotions to their audiences, he is an early advocate of an expression\ntheory of the arts. \n\nThe Critical Reflections make a contribution to the Quarrel\nof the Ancients and Moderns. This was a long running debate about the\nrelative merits of ancient and modern writers and artists. Du\nBos’s contribution to the debate is judicious. He reaches the\nconclusion that modern sculptors have not surpassed their ancient\ncounterparts. With regard to painting, he says that it is difficult to\nreach a judgement since so few ancient paintings have survived.\nNevertheless, he thinks it unlikely that modern painters have\nsurpassed the ancients. Ancient poets have a significant edge over\nmodern ones. Du Bos allows that, in the natural sciences, modern\nscientists have eclipsed the ancients. \n\nMuch of Du Bos’s book is devoted to an explanation of artistic\ngenius. He is particularly concerned to explain why certain eras (the\nGolden Age of Athens, the Rome of Augustus, the Italian Renaissance,\nand the era of Louis XIV) are more productive of geniuses. Although Du\nBos says, in passing, that a “poet needs divine\ninspiration” (1.33), he decisively rejects the Platonic\nconception of genius. Instead, he believes that genius has physical\ncauses. In part, genius is to be explained by physiological\nconsiderations. According to Du Bos, a genius has a well-formed brain\nand other physiological advantages over other people. Most\nimportantly, he believes, genius is the result of certain\nenvironmental factors. These factors include climate, air quality,\nsoil, and diet. For example, England is supposedly unable to produce\npainters of the first rank because the climate is too cold. Although\nhighly influential in the eighteenth century, Du Bos’s views on\ngenius have been supplanted. Nevertheless, Du Bos’s views on\ngenius are noteworthy as an early effort to provide a scientific\nexplanation of genius. \n\nAlthough Du Bos was primarily concerned with poetry and painting, he\nmade a significant contribution to philosophy of music. He was an\nadvocate of the resemblance theory of musical expression. According to\nthis theory, music is expressive of emotions because it resembles\nhuman expressive behavior. This view is found, in the contemporary\nworld, in Davies (1994) and Kivy (1980). (See the article on\nPhilosophy of Music, 3.1.) Music can resemble either vocal or\nnon-vocal expressive behavior. It can resemble, for example, the\nplodding steps of a sad person or the joyful cries of a happy\none. Because music resembles such expressive behavior, it is heard as\nsad, joyful, or expressive of some other emotion. \n\nIn the Critical Reflections, the resemblance theory is\ncrucial in explaining how music can be, like painting and poetry, an\nimitative art. It does so by resembling and, consequently, imitating\n“natural signs of the passions”. Du Bos also believes that\nmusic can imitate sounds in nature. He writes that “There is\ntruth in a symphony, composed to imitate a tempest, when the music of\nthe symphony, its harmony and its rhythm, make us hear a noise similar\nto the tumult of the wind and the roaring waves, which clash with each\nother or break against the rocks.” (1.45) (Here the word\n‘symphony’ means instrumental music. It does not refer to\na symphony in the modern sense of the word.) Notice that, on Du\nBos’s view, even purely instrumental music can be imitative. \n\nUnlike some modern advocates of the resemblance theory, Du Bos\nbelieves that the experience of musical imitations arouses emotion.\nMusic arouses emotions in very much the same way that poetry and\npainting do. The emotion aroused will be the emotion that would be\naroused by the object represented. \n\nDu Bos’s prose is often execrable. Voltaire wrote, with\nreference to Du Bos and the Critical Reflections, that,\n“the judgement is good, the style bad. It is necessary to read\nhim, but re-reading him would be tiresome”\n(Voltaire Correspondence, letter 3917). Only one English\ntranslation of the Critical Reflections has been\npublished. Thomas Nugent translated the book as Critical\nReflections on Poetry, Painting and Music (Du Bos\n1748). Unfortunately, this translation is inaccurate and preserves all\nof the problems of the original French. All of the translations in\nthis article have been made by the authors from the sixth edition (Du\nBos 1755). \n\nNo single person deserves to be credited as the inventor of modern\naesthetics. Several figures in the early eighteenth century\nindependently made contributions to criticism and philosophy that\nwould become modern aesthetics. In England, Shaftesbury’s\nCharacteristicks of Men, Manners, Opinions, and Times (1711)\nand Joseph Addison’s Pleasures of the Imagination\n(1712) laid some of the groundwork for aesthetics. On the Continent,\nJean-Pierre de Crousaz’s Traité de beau (1715)\nand Christian Wolff’s Rational Thoughts on God, the World,\nand the Soul of Man (1720) were pioneering contributions to\naesthetics. All of these works appeared in the second decade of the\neighteenth century, as did Du Bos’s Critical\nReflections.  Du Bos deserves to be recognized as among the\noriginators of modern aesthetics and philosophy of art. His importance\nwas widely recognized in the eighteenth century. Johann Georg Sulzer,\nin his General Theory of the Fine Arts (1771–74)\ndescribed Du Bos as “the first of modern critics to construct a\ntheory of art upon general principles” (Baker and Christensen\n1995, 25). \n\nThe influence of Du Bos on aesthetics in France began with his impact\non Voltaire (Williams 1966). He described Du Bos as “a very\nwise, very learned, and very esteemed man” and, according to\nVoltaire, “All artists read with profit his Reflections\non poetry, painting, and music” (Voltaire 1877–85, vol. 3,\n10; vol. 14, 66). Du Bos’s influence is found at a number of\npoints in Voltaire’s writings. He adopts Du Bos’s\nsubjectivism, writing that, “In order to judge poets, it is\nnecessary to know how to feel” (Voltaire 1877–85, vol. 8,\n319). Voltaire agreed with Du Bos that there have been four ages where\nthe arts particularly flourished and he agreed with Du Bos’s\nassessment of which ages they have been. Voltaire also adopted one of\nDu Bos’s controversial views: the belief that national character\nis affected by matters such as climate. \n\nDu Bos had a significant impact on the Encyclopaedia of\nDiderot and d’Alembert. Louis, chevalier de Jaucourt was the\nauthor of many of this work’s articles on the fine arts and he\ncites Du Bos in the articles on Painting, Modern Painting, Inscription,\nLandscape Painting, and Landscape Painter. In fact, a large chunk of\nthe article on Landscape Painting is lifted wholesale out of\nCritical Reflections 1.6 (d’Alembert et al. 2003). \n\nThe influence of Du Bos on Jean Jacques Rousseau has long since been\nestablished (Jones 1974). This influence is particularly apparent in\nthe Lettre à mr d’Alembert sur les spectacles\n(1758). Rousseau agrees with Du Bos that theatre does not aim to\narouse in audience members the sentiment that the characters\nrepresented feel. Rousseau agrees that, on the contrary, theatre\narouses quite opposed sentiments. For example, if a character in a\ntragedy is represented as feeling fear and despair, audience members\nwill have pity aroused in them. \n\nDu Bos seems to have been one of the important sources of the\nresemblance theory of musical expression in the eighteenth century.\nBatteux is known to have read the Critical Reflections and\nwas apparently influenced by Du Bos when he wrote that gestures and\nsounds are “natural means of expression” that are\n“especially suited to the expression of emotion”. He adds\nthat “music is half-formed in the words that express some\nemotion. It takes only a little art to turn the words into music\n” (Batteux 1746/2015, 129; 133). These passages from The\nFine Arts are little more than paraphrases of passages from the\nCritical Reflections. \n\nDu Bos had a significant influence on aesthetics in Britain. His\ninfluence is found, for example, in James Harris’s Three\nTreatises, particularly in the second of these treatises,\n‘A Discourse on Music, Painting and Poetry’ (Harris\n1744). In fact, this treatise is little more than a brief reprisal of\ncentral themes from the Critical Reflections. Harris, like Du\nBos, distinguishes between the fine arts according to their means of\nexpression. Painting employs natural signs and poetry artificial ones.\nThey agree that this gives painting an advantage when it comes to the\narousal of emotion, but both believe that the power of poetry can be\nenhanced by music and staging to the point where it has the advantage\nover poetry. They agree that art owes its value to its capacity to\narouse sentiments. \n\nSince Jones (1982) it has been known that Du Bos had an impact on\nHume’s thinking about art. Hume owned the 1732 edition of the\nCritical Reflections (Norton and Norton, 1996, 88). He must\nhave acquired it soon after his move to France to begin writing his\nTreatise. \n\nHume’s discussion of Du Bos in ‘Of Tragedy’ has\nalready been noted, but Jones (1982) argues that Du Bos’s\ninfluence is also apparent in ‘Of the Standard of Taste’.\nHume’s views on art were influenced by several of his\ncontemporaries, including Francis Hutcheson, and it can be difficult\nto disentangle their contributions to his thought. (See the article on\nScottish Philosophy in the 18th Century, section 4 for a discussion of\nHutcheson’s influence on Hume.) The difficulty is compounded by\nthe fact that the views of Hutcheson and Du Bos are similar in certain\nrespects. Nevertheless, Jones (1982) finds significance in the fact\nHume, like Du Bos, believed that we have an internal sense of beauty.\nBoth believe that this sense of beauty, not reason, is the means by\nwhich the beauty of work is determined. Moreover, there is an uncanny\nsimilarity between the ways in which they express these views. Du Bos,\nin the Critical Reflections, and Hume, in ‘Of the\nStandard of Taste,’ say that they are opposed to\n“geometrical” criticism. Both believe that rules of\ncriticism can be given, but that they can be violated by great works\nof art. Both give Ariosto as an example of a poet who violates the\nrules of criticism. \n\nJones (1982) noted the impact of Du Bos on Hume’s essays, but\ndid not remark on the impact of the Frenchman on Hume’s\nTreatise. Norton and Norton, in their edition of the\nTreatise (Hume 1739–40 [2007]) noted some passages\nwhere Du Bos influenced Hume, but many more passages have recently\nbeen identified (Mazza and Mori 2016; Young and Cameron\n2018). Virtually every passage in the Treatise where the fine\narts are mentioned shows signs of Du Bos’s influence. Young and\nCameron (2018) have argued that several passages in\nthe Treatise so closely resemble passages in the Critical\nReflections that the similarity cannot be coincidental. For\nexample, both Du Bos and Hume agree that poetry and painting arouse\nthe same emotions that we feel in ordinary life, but that the emotions\naroused by the arts are fainter. Hume, like Du Bos, believes that\npassions that are displeasing when experienced in daily life can be\npleasing when aroused by art. A passage in the\nTreatise (2.2.4.4) refers to Du Bos’s view that humans\nare plagued by ennui and they seek to escape it by gaming and other\nactivities. On the other hand, Hume explicitly rejects Du Bos’s\nview on the influence of climate on national character. \n\nLombard (1913) judged that Du Bos’s impact was greatest in\nGermany. Du Bos was responsible for a move away from a rationalist\napproach to criticism there as in France. His influence in Germany is\nfound as early as Johann Jakob Breitinger’s Critische\nDichtkunst (1740). Subsequently, Baumgarten, Herder, Lessing,\nMendelssohn, and Winckelmann either adopted some of Du Bos’s\nviews or argued against them. Lessing translated part of\nthe Critical Reflections into German and was deeply\ninfluenced by him. For a study of the relationship between Du Bos and\nLessing see Leysaht (1874). \n\nDu Bos’s primary contributions to philosophy are in aesthetics\nbut he also contributed to the revolt against Cartesianism in France.\nCartesianism dominated French thinking about knowledge and science\nuntil well into the eighteenth century (Illiffe 2003, 269). Du\nBos’s approach to philosophy of art was thoroughly empiricist\nand so was his attitude towards science. He deserves credit for\napplying Locke’s empirical account of knowledge to scientific\nhypotheses. \n\nIn the first instance, Du Bos applied empiricism to the study of\nart, as we have seen. According to Du Bos, judgements of works of art\nmust be empirical. He writes that \n\nElsewhere Du Bos adds that \n\nDu Bos stresses the importance of sentiments, that is, the feelings\nwe have in response to works of art. \n\nWhile Du Bos rejected rationalism in judgements about art, his\nempiricism did not end there. He was opposed to the a priori\nconstruction of scientific systems. He notes that \n\nIn another passage, Du Bos discusses Harvey’s discovery of the\ncirculation of blood and makes clear that it could only have been\ndiscovered a posteriori. People have accepted Harvey’s\nhypothesis, Du Bos writes, because \n\nThis passage is clearly an endorsement of empiricism and a rejection\nof Cartesian rationalism. \n\nDu Bos makes a related claim in a discussion of physicians. A\nphysician may be a Cartesian while young, but he will end up as an\nempiricist. According to Du Bos, \n\nExperience will transform the wise physician into an empiricist.\nElsewhere, Du Bos says something similar about engineering, navigation\nand related sciences. He considers four modern scientific discoveries\n(the discovery of air pressure, the invention of the compass, the\ndevelopment of the printing press, and the invention of the telescope)\nand observes that all of these discoveries were due to the acquisition\nof new experiences. \n\nWhen Du Bos investigates any scientific matter, he proceeds in an\nempirical fashion. For example, he examines the question of why certain\neras have produced more geniuses than other periods. He begins by\nconsidering the hypothesis that a social cause is responsible for the\nproduction of geniuses. In particular, he considers the hypothesis that\nthe production of geniuses can be explained by reference to generous\npatrons. He refutes this hypothesis by giving examples of eras when\npatrons abounded but geniuses were scarce. Having empirically refuted\nthis hypothesis, he considers the hypothesis that genius has a natural\nor physical cause. Du Bos supports this hypothesis by attempting to\nfind a correlation between certain environmental, climatic, and dietary\nfactors and the production of genius. Du Bos’s views on the origin\nof genius were widely accepted in the first two thirds of the\neighteenth century. Herder, Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Winckelmann were\namong the important figures to adopt Du Bos’s views on climate\nand genius. \n\nDu Bos held that scientific investigation always involves some\nuncertainty. He wrote that “I distrust physical explanations,\nsince the imperfection of this science almost always makes guesswork\nnecessary” (2.2). According to Du Bos, a scientific hypothesis\nis only probable to some extent or another. He illustrates this view\nby reference to Harvey’s hypothesis concerning the circulation\nof blood. Du Bos writes that, “Most scholars of his\n[Harvey’s] time were persuaded by his views.

He participated in\nthe Quarrel of the Ancients and Moderns, wrote on numismatics, delved\ninto a variety of historical questions, and had an enduring love of\nthe fine arts. Today he is primarily known as the author\nof Critical Reflections on Poetry and Painting (1719) and as\none of the founders of modern aesthetics. Deeply influenced by his\nfriend John Locke, Du Bos made a major contribution to the spread of\nempiricism in France, both in aesthetics and other areas of\nphilosophy. He influenced almost all eighteenth-century contributors\nto aesthetics, including Charles Batteux, Alexander Gottlieb\nBaumgarten, David Hume, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Moses Mendelssohn,\nand Jean Jacques Rousseau.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDu Bos was born in Beauvais on 14 December 1670. Little is known of\nhis family or childhood. He was educated in Paris, where he received a\nMaster of Arts in 1688 and a Bachelor of Theology in 1692. Although\nlater in life he was a titular abbé and canon, he seems to have\nhad little interest in the ecclesiastical life. He was more interested\nin politics and in the life of a man of letters and he soon moved in\nleading intellectual circles. His friends included Nicolas\nBoileau-Déspreaux, an important poet and literary critic,\nCharles Perrault, another major poet, and Pierre Bayle, the famous\nphilosopher. He was a friend of Jean Jacques Rousseau though, as was\noften the case with Rousseau’s friendships, the friendship did\nnot endure. Du Bos was particularly closely associated with Bayle, who\nhad an important impact on Du Bos’s thought. Du Bos traveled\nextensively in Europe in his capacity as a diplomat and in order to\nmeet the leading intellectuals of the day. Lombard 1913 remains the\nstandard account of his life. \n\nDu Bos’s first book was Histoire de Quatre Gordiens,\nprouvée et illustrée par les Médailles\n(History of the Four Gordians, proven and illustrated by\nmedallions) (1695). In this work, he argued, on the basis of\nnumismatic evidence, that there had been four, not three Gordian\nemperors. His hypothesis was quickly refuted by historians. \n\nDu Bos worked as a diplomat and was involved in negotiating a peace\ntreaty between the Netherlands and France. In this connection, he\nwrote\nLes Interests de l’Angleterre mal entendus dans la guerre\nprésente (England’s Interests in the Present War\nMisunderstood) (1703). \n\nHis next book was L’Histoire de la Ligue de\nCambray (History of the League of Cambrai). This was a\nclear and engaging history of the alliance, including France,\nassembled by Pope Julius II to wage war against the Venetian Republic\nbetween 1508 and 1516. The book was praised by, among others,\nVoltaire. \n\nDu Bos travelled to England in 1698 to meet John Locke at the request\nof their mutual friend Nicolas Toinard. Toinard wanted advice on the\npreparation of a translation of Locke’s Essay concerning\nHuman Understanding. Locke and Du Bos became close friends and\nLocke asked his French friend to review the French translation of\nthe Essay. The influence of Locke’s empiricism is\nevident throughout the Critical Reflections. \n\nIn 1719 Du Bos published Réflexions critiques sur la\npoésie et sur la peinture (Critical Reflections on\nPoetry and Painting), the book on which his posthumous reputation\ndepends. Further editions appeared in 1732, 1733, 1740, 1746, 1755,\n1760, and 1770. The work was significantly expanded and revised for\nthe 1740 and subsequent editions. It was translated into German,\nDutch, and English. Largely on the basis of the Critical\nReflections, Du Bos was elected to the Académie\nfrançaise in 1720. He became perpetual secretary of the\nAcadémie in 1723. \n\nDu Bos’s final major work was the Histoire critique de\nl’établissement de la monarchie française dans les\nGaules (Critical History of the Establishment of the French\nMonarchy in Gaul) (1734). The book’s thesis is that the\nFranks did not conquer Gaul. Rather, according to Du Bos, the Gauls\ninvited them to become the rulers of what became France. The book won\nthe praise of many, including Edward Gibbon, but it was effectively\ncriticized by Montesquieu in The Spirit of the Laws. \n\nBy all accounts, Du Bos was a pleasant and charming man. Many\naffectionate remembrances were published in the wake of his death on\n23 March 1742. \n\nCritical Reflections on Poetry and Painting begins with an\ninvestigation of the “striking pleasure (1.1)” that humans\nreceive from the experience of poetry and painting. (All references to\nthe Critical Reflections are by volume and chapter. These\nreferences will be correct for any edition from 1740 on.) The book\nfocuses on the two fine arts mentioned in the book’s title, but\nDu Bos also discusses sculpture, engraving, dance, and music.\nAccording to Du Bos, we receive pleasure from the fine arts because\nworks of art are imitations of objects in the world. Presumably, on Du\nBos’s view, the similarity between imitations and the objects\nimitated is responsible for the arousal of emotion. When we experience\nimitations, we receive emotions similar to, but less intense than, the\nemotions we feel when we experience the objects imitated. If these\nemotions are pleasing, Du Bos has an account of the pleasure that\nhumans receive from experience of the fine arts. \n\nDu Bos’s account of the striking pleasure that we receive from\nthe fine arts commits him to the ancient view that the fine arts are\nimitative arts. This view is traceable to Plato and Aristotle and Du\nBos acknowledges these ancient sources. Although the view that the\nfine arts make up a coherent ‘system’ is sometimes\nattributed to Charles Batteux (Kristeller 1951; 1952), Du Bos’s\nviews clearly anticipate those of Batteux (Young 2015). \n\nAccording to Du Bos, all arts are imitative, but the arts do not all\nrepresent in the same way. In the course of the Critical\nReflections, Du Bos makes a contribution to philosophy of\nlanguage by distinguishing between natural signs and the artificial\nsigns found in language. Natural signs, such as those found in\npainting, sculpture, and music, represent because they resemble their\nobjects. The artificial signs of language are arbitrary or\nconventional. They are employed in poetry (that is, literature). \n\nDu Bos asks which of the arts is best able to arouse emotions. He\nbelieves that painting has an advantage over poetry on the grounds\nthat natural signs affect us more effectively. He argues, however,\nthat poetry when combined with music or acting (or both, as in opera)\nhas an advantage over painting. \n\nDu Bos is aware that his account of the pleasure we receive from art\nfaces a serious objection. When the emotions we receive from viewing\nan imitation are positive, Du Bos’s account has a prima facie\nplausibility. Sometimes, however, as he recognizes, we receive\nunpleasant emotions from the experience of artistic imitations. Du Bos\nconsiders, for example, an imitation of the sacrifice of\nJephthah’s daughter and Le Brun’s painting, Massacre\nof the Innocents. These works arouse negative\nemotions. Nevertheless, we willingly, even enthusiastically,\nexperience the works. Our willingness to experience works that arouse\nnegative emotions is often referred to as the paradox of tragedy. \n\nDu Bos tries to resolve the paradox by making two points. He begins by\nsaying that, although imitations of unpleasant events will arouse\nunpleasant emotions, these emotions are not as intense or as enduring\nas we receive from experience of the events themselves. This point\ncannot, by itself, resolve the paradox. Du Bos’s second point is\nthat although the emotions aroused by imitations of unpleasant events\nare unpleasant, they are preferable to an emotion that we would\notherwise feel. According to Du Bos, we are constitutionally subject\nto a feeling of deep ennui. This ennui is not merely boredom. Rather\nit is a weariness of the human condition. \n\nIn ‘On Tragedy,’ Hume endorses Du Bos’s solution to\nthe paradox, at least up to a point. Hume notes that, according to Du\nBos, “nothing is in general so disagreeable to the mind as the\nlanguid, listless state of indolence, into which it falls upon the\nremoval of all passion and occupation.” Hume then adds that,\nwhen a work of tragic art arouses an emotion “Let it be\ndisagreeable, afflicting, melancholy, disordered; it is still better\nthan…insipid languor” (Hume 1757, 217). Some contemporary\nphilosophers have also found merit in Du Bos’s approach to the\nparadox of tragedy (Livingston 2013). \n\nLater in the Critical Reflections Du Bos returns to the\nparadox of tragedy and gives a rather different solution. This later\npassage is apparently influenced by Aristotle’s Poetics\nsince Du Bos speaks of the purging of emotions. He means by this,\nhowever, something other than Aristotle meant. According to Du Bos,\n“The faithful depiction of the passions suffices to make us\nafraid and make us resolve to avoid them with all of the determination\nof which we are capable” (1.44). For example, we watch a\nperformance of Medea and we are horrified by the passion for\nvengeance and resolve not to indulge in it. \n\nThe concept of sentiments is crucial to Du Bos’s thought. He\nseems to have been the writer who made talk of sentiments so\ncommonplace in eighteenth-century aesthetics. Du Bos never precisely\ndefines what he means when he speaks of sentiments. In what is,\nperhaps, the closest he comes to a definition he writes that,\n“The first ideas born in the soul, when it receives a lively\nstimulus,…we call sentiments” (1.33). According\nto Du Bos, sentiments are not produced by a special sort of aesthetic\nexperience. Rather, they are, as already indicated, ordinary emotional\nresponses. We can receive sentiments from experience of ordinary\nobjects and from experience of the imitations found in art. The\ndifference, as already noted, is that sentiments produced by art are\nfainter. \n\nDespite believing that sentiments are ordinary emotions or fainter\ncopies of them, Du Bos posits a sense of beauty. He writes that,\n“We have in us a sense intended to judge the value of works that\nimitate touching objects in nature” and calls this a\n“sixth sense” (2.22). Du Bos compares the sense of beauty\nto gustatory taste and seems to have been among the first writers to\ndo so. \n\nSince artistic imitations are intended to arouse emotions similar to\nthose aroused by the objects imitated, Du Bos values what he calls\nvraisemblance (verisimilitude). Painters, for example, must\n“make a painting consistent with what we know of the customs,\nhabits, architecture, and arms of the people that one intends to\nrepresent” (1.30). A work can, however,\nbe vraisemblable without being an imitation of the real world\nand historical events. A work can be vraisemblable and yet be\nan example of what Du Bos calls “the marvelous”. An opera,\nfor example, can be\nvraisemblable even though it depicts marvelous ancient Greek\ngods and goddesses. It must, however, depict them as existing in a way\nthat gods and goddesses can exist. Vraisemblance is not an\nend in itself as it was for some earlier thinkers. The real goal of\nthe arts is to arouse sentiments and vraisemblance is only a\nmeans of doing so. \n\nAccording to Du Bos, we judge artworks by means of our sentiments\nrather than by means of reason. He rejects the rationalist school of\ncriticism associated with writers such as Roland Fréart de\nChambray (1606—76), the author of L’Idée de la\nperfection de la peinture demonstrée par les principles de\nl’art (1662) and Jean Terrasson, whose work\nDissertation critique sur l’Iliade d’Homere\nappeared in 1715. Terrasson wrote that, “Any man who does not\nthink of any literary matter as Descartes prescribes to think about\nphysical matters, is not worthy of the present century …\nNothing prepares better than mathematics to properly judge works of\nwit” (Terrasson 1715, lxv). In a similar vein, Bosse wrote that\nthe “noble art of painting must be based for the most\npart on correct and rule-governed reasoning, which is to say,\ngeometrical and, consequently, demonstrative.” Du Bos mocks\nthese writers as ‘geometrical critics’. \n\nHe writes that the evaluation of art “is not left to reason. It\nmust submit to the judgement that sentiment pronounces. Sentiment is\nthe competent judge of this issue.” He goes on to compare the\nevaluation of an artwork to making a judgement about a ragout. Reason\nis of no use here. Rather, “We taste the ragout and…we\nknow that it is good. It is the same with works of wit and pictures\nmade to please us by touching us” (1.22). \n\nIn making sentiments the means by which artworks are judged, Du Bos\ngave rise to a question that he did not fully appreciate and certainly\ndid not solve. This is the question of providing a standard of taste.\nDu Bos is a subjectivist. He makes the value of an artwork a\nresponse-dependent property. A work of art is valuable if it arouses\ncertain valuable sentiments in audience members. Du Bos was aware that\ndifferent works will arouse different pleasing sentiments in different\npeople: \n\nThe problem, as Hume clearly recognized, was that not everyone\nreceives the same sentiments from a work of art. This leads to the\nconclusion that a work has value for some people and not for others.\nHowever, as Hume also recognized, thorough-going subjectivism is\ncounterintuitive. It seems that there is a fact that Milton is a\ngreater poet than Ogilby, even if some people prefer Ogilby. \n\nDu Bos was unaware of the full extent of the problem caused by\nsubjectivism. Likely this was because he believed that everyone has\nvery much the same sentiments. In fact, he believed that the general\npublic was the best judge of the value of artworks because their taste\nwas least corrupted by prejudice. \n\nDu Bos also proposes the test of time. When a work of art repeatedly\npleases audiences over a long period of time, this is conclusive\nevidence that it is a work of high value. Du Bos point out, for\nexample, that the reputations of the best Greek and Roman poets are\nfirmly established since they have pleased audiences through the\nages. \n\nSome writers, Du Bos was aware, believe that artworks can be valuable\nas a source of knowledge. At times Du Bos indicates that there is\nsomething to this, and that art is valuable as more than the source of\nvaluable sentiments. In the end, however, his considered opinion is\nthat, “We can acquire some knowledge by reading a poem, but this\nis scarcely the motive for opening the book” (1.34). \n\nDu Bos speaks about audience members’ states of mind but he also\nspeaks of the artist’s state of mind. Artists, he believes, feel\nthe emotions that their works arouse in audience members. Indeed, the\nartist’s “goal is to make us share his sentiments”\n(2.1). The difference between the artist’s state of mind, and\nthose of audience members, is that the artist’s sentiments are\nmore intense. Artists must be in a state of “enthusiasm”\nif they are to create successful works of art. This enthusiasm can\nborder on madness. Since Du Bos believes that artists convey their\nemotions to their audiences, he is an early advocate of an expression\ntheory of the arts. \n\nThe Critical Reflections make a contribution to the Quarrel\nof the Ancients and Moderns. This was a long running debate about the\nrelative merits of ancient and modern writers and artists. Du\nBos’s contribution to the debate is judicious. He reaches the\nconclusion that modern sculptors have not surpassed their ancient\ncounterparts. With regard to painting, he says that it is difficult to\nreach a judgement since so few ancient paintings have survived.\nNevertheless, he thinks it unlikely that modern painters have\nsurpassed the ancients. Ancient poets have a significant edge over\nmodern ones. Du Bos allows that, in the natural sciences, modern\nscientists have eclipsed the ancients. \n\nMuch of Du Bos’s book is devoted to an explanation of artistic\ngenius. He is particularly concerned to explain why certain eras (the\nGolden Age of Athens, the Rome of Augustus, the Italian Renaissance,\nand the era of Louis XIV) are more productive of geniuses. Although Du\nBos says, in passing, that a “poet needs divine\ninspiration” (1.33), he decisively rejects the Platonic\nconception of genius. Instead, he believes that genius has physical\ncauses. In part, genius is to be explained by physiological\nconsiderations. According to Du Bos, a genius has a well-formed brain\nand other physiological advantages over other people. Most\nimportantly, he believes, genius is the result of certain\nenvironmental factors. These factors include climate, air quality,\nsoil, and diet. For example, England is supposedly unable to produce\npainters of the first rank because the climate is too cold. Although\nhighly influential in the eighteenth century, Du Bos’s views on\ngenius have been supplanted. Nevertheless, Du Bos’s views on\ngenius are noteworthy as an early effort to provide a scientific\nexplanation of genius. \n\nAlthough Du Bos was primarily concerned with poetry and painting, he\nmade a significant contribution to philosophy of music. He was an\nadvocate of the resemblance theory of musical expression. According to\nthis theory, music is expressive of emotions because it resembles\nhuman expressive behavior. This view is found, in the contemporary\nworld, in Davies (1994) and Kivy (1980). (See the article on\nPhilosophy of Music, 3.1.) Music can resemble either vocal or\nnon-vocal expressive behavior. It can resemble, for example, the\nplodding steps of a sad person or the joyful cries of a happy\none. Because music resembles such expressive behavior, it is heard as\nsad, joyful, or expressive of some other emotion. \n\nIn the Critical Reflections, the resemblance theory is\ncrucial in explaining how music can be, like painting and poetry, an\nimitative art. It does so by resembling and, consequently, imitating\n“natural signs of the passions”. Du Bos also believes that\nmusic can imitate sounds in nature. He writes that “There is\ntruth in a symphony, composed to imitate a tempest, when the music of\nthe symphony, its harmony and its rhythm, make us hear a noise similar\nto the tumult of the wind and the roaring waves, which clash with each\nother or break against the rocks.” (1.45) (Here the word\n‘symphony’ means instrumental music. It does not refer to\na symphony in the modern sense of the word.) Notice that, on Du\nBos’s view, even purely instrumental music can be imitative. \n\nUnlike some modern advocates of the resemblance theory, Du Bos\nbelieves that the experience of musical imitations arouses emotion.\nMusic arouses emotions in very much the same way that poetry and\npainting do. The emotion aroused will be the emotion that would be\naroused by the object represented. \n\nDu Bos’s prose is often execrable. Voltaire wrote, with\nreference to Du Bos and the Critical Reflections, that,\n“the judgement is good, the style bad. It is necessary to read\nhim, but re-reading him would be tiresome”\n(Voltaire Correspondence, letter 3917). Only one English\ntranslation of the Critical Reflections has been\npublished. Thomas Nugent translated the book as Critical\nReflections on Poetry, Painting and Music (Du Bos\n1748). Unfortunately, this translation is inaccurate and preserves all\nof the problems of the original French. All of the translations in\nthis article have been made by the authors from the sixth edition (Du\nBos 1755). \n\nNo single person deserves to be credited as the inventor of modern\naesthetics. Several figures in the early eighteenth century\nindependently made contributions to criticism and philosophy that\nwould become modern aesthetics. In England, Shaftesbury’s\nCharacteristicks of Men, Manners, Opinions, and Times (1711)\nand Joseph Addison’s Pleasures of the Imagination\n(1712) laid some of the groundwork for aesthetics. On the Continent,\nJean-Pierre de Crousaz’s Traité de beau (1715)\nand Christian Wolff’s Rational Thoughts on God, the World,\nand the Soul of Man (1720) were pioneering contributions to\naesthetics. All of these works appeared in the second decade of the\neighteenth century, as did Du Bos’s Critical\nReflections.  Du Bos deserves to be recognized as among the\noriginators of modern aesthetics and philosophy of art. His importance\nwas widely recognized in the eighteenth century. Johann Georg Sulzer,\nin his General Theory of the Fine Arts (1771–74)\ndescribed Du Bos as “the first of modern critics to construct a\ntheory of art upon general principles” (Baker and Christensen\n1995, 25). \n\nThe influence of Du Bos on aesthetics in France began with his impact\non Voltaire (Williams 1966). He described Du Bos as “a very\nwise, very learned, and very esteemed man” and, according to\nVoltaire, “All artists read with profit his Reflections\non poetry, painting, and music” (Voltaire 1877–85, vol. 3,\n10; vol. 14, 66). Du Bos’s influence is found at a number of\npoints in Voltaire’s writings. He adopts Du Bos’s\nsubjectivism, writing that, “In order to judge poets, it is\nnecessary to know how to feel” (Voltaire 1877–85, vol. 8,\n319). Voltaire agreed with Du Bos that there have been four ages where\nthe arts particularly flourished and he agreed with Du Bos’s\nassessment of which ages they have been. Voltaire also adopted one of\nDu Bos’s controversial views: the belief that national character\nis affected by matters such as climate. \n\nDu Bos had a significant impact on the Encyclopaedia of\nDiderot and d’Alembert. Louis, chevalier de Jaucourt was the\nauthor of many of this work’s articles on the fine arts and he\ncites Du Bos in the articles on Painting, Modern Painting, Inscription,\nLandscape Painting, and Landscape Painter. In fact, a large chunk of\nthe article on Landscape Painting is lifted wholesale out of\nCritical Reflections 1.6 (d’Alembert et al. 2003). \n\nThe influence of Du Bos on Jean Jacques Rousseau has long since been\nestablished (Jones 1974). This influence is particularly apparent in\nthe Lettre à mr d’Alembert sur les spectacles\n(1758). Rousseau agrees with Du Bos that theatre does not aim to\narouse in audience members the sentiment that the characters\nrepresented feel. Rousseau agrees that, on the contrary, theatre\narouses quite opposed sentiments. For example, if a character in a\ntragedy is represented as feeling fear and despair, audience members\nwill have pity aroused in them. \n\nDu Bos seems to have been one of the important sources of the\nresemblance theory of musical expression in the eighteenth century.\nBatteux is known to have read the Critical Reflections and\nwas apparently influenced by Du Bos when he wrote that gestures and\nsounds are “natural means of expression” that are\n“especially suited to the expression of emotion”. He adds\nthat “music is half-formed in the words that express some\nemotion. It takes only a little art to turn the words into music\n” (Batteux 1746/2015, 129; 133). These passages from The\nFine Arts are little more than paraphrases of passages from the\nCritical Reflections. \n\nDu Bos had a significant influence on aesthetics in Britain. His\ninfluence is found, for example, in James Harris’s Three\nTreatises, particularly in the second of these treatises,\n‘A Discourse on Music, Painting and Poetry’ (Harris\n1744). In fact, this treatise is little more than a brief reprisal of\ncentral themes from the Critical Reflections. Harris, like Du\nBos, distinguishes between the fine arts according to their means of\nexpression. Painting employs natural signs and poetry artificial ones.\nThey agree that this gives painting an advantage when it comes to the\narousal of emotion, but both believe that the power of poetry can be\nenhanced by music and staging to the point where it has the advantage\nover poetry. They agree that art owes its value to its capacity to\narouse sentiments. \n\nSince Jones (1982) it has been known that Du Bos had an impact on\nHume’s thinking about art. Hume owned the 1732 edition of the\nCritical Reflections (Norton and Norton, 1996, 88). He must\nhave acquired it soon after his move to France to begin writing his\nTreatise. \n\nHume’s discussion of Du Bos in ‘Of Tragedy’ has\nalready been noted, but Jones (1982) argues that Du Bos’s\ninfluence is also apparent in ‘Of the Standard of Taste’.\nHume’s views on art were influenced by several of his\ncontemporaries, including Francis Hutcheson, and it can be difficult\nto disentangle their contributions to his thought. (See the article on\nScottish Philosophy in the 18th Century, section 4 for a discussion of\nHutcheson’s influence on Hume.) The difficulty is compounded by\nthe fact that the views of Hutcheson and Du Bos are similar in certain\nrespects. Nevertheless, Jones (1982) finds significance in the fact\nHume, like Du Bos, believed that we have an internal sense of beauty.\nBoth believe that this sense of beauty, not reason, is the means by\nwhich the beauty of work is determined. Moreover, there is an uncanny\nsimilarity between the ways in which they express these views. Du Bos,\nin the Critical Reflections, and Hume, in ‘Of the\nStandard of Taste,’ say that they are opposed to\n“geometrical” criticism. Both believe that rules of\ncriticism can be given, but that they can be violated by great works\nof art. Both give Ariosto as an example of a poet who violates the\nrules of criticism. \n\nJones (1982) noted the impact of Du Bos on Hume’s essays, but\ndid not remark on the impact of the Frenchman on Hume’s\nTreatise. Norton and Norton, in their edition of the\nTreatise (Hume 1739–40 [2007]) noted some passages\nwhere Du Bos influenced Hume, but many more passages have recently\nbeen identified (Mazza and Mori 2016; Young and Cameron\n2018). Virtually every passage in the Treatise where the fine\narts are mentioned shows signs of Du Bos’s influence. Young and\nCameron (2018) have argued that several passages in\nthe Treatise so closely resemble passages in the Critical\nReflections that the similarity cannot be coincidental. For\nexample, both Du Bos and Hume agree that poetry and painting arouse\nthe same emotions that we feel in ordinary life, but that the emotions\naroused by the arts are fainter. Hume, like Du Bos, believes that\npassions that are displeasing when experienced in daily life can be\npleasing when aroused by art. A passage in the\nTreatise (2.2.4.4) refers to Du Bos’s view that humans\nare plagued by ennui and they seek to escape it by gaming and other\nactivities. On the other hand, Hume explicitly rejects Du Bos’s\nview on the influence of climate on national character. \n\nLombard (1913) judged that Du Bos’s impact was greatest in\nGermany. Du Bos was responsible for a move away from a rationalist\napproach to criticism there as in France. His influence in Germany is\nfound as early as Johann Jakob Breitinger’s Critische\nDichtkunst (1740). Subsequently, Baumgarten, Herder, Lessing,\nMendelssohn, and Winckelmann either adopted some of Du Bos’s\nviews or argued against them. Lessing translated part of\nthe Critical Reflections into German and was deeply\ninfluenced by him. For a study of the relationship between Du Bos and\nLessing see Leysaht (1874). \n\nDu Bos’s primary contributions to philosophy are in aesthetics\nbut he also contributed to the revolt against Cartesianism in France.\nCartesianism dominated French thinking about knowledge and science\nuntil well into the eighteenth century (Illiffe 2003, 269). Du\nBos’s approach to philosophy of art was thoroughly empiricist\nand so was his attitude towards science. He deserves credit for\napplying Locke’s empirical account of knowledge to scientific\nhypotheses. \n\nIn the first instance, Du Bos applied empiricism to the study of\nart, as we have seen. According to Du Bos, judgements of works of art\nmust be empirical. He writes that \n\nElsewhere Du Bos adds that \n\nDu Bos stresses the importance of sentiments, that is, the feelings\nwe have in response to works of art. \n\nWhile Du Bos rejected rationalism in judgements about art, his\nempiricism did not end there. He was opposed to the a priori\nconstruction of scientific systems. He notes that \n\nIn another passage, Du Bos discusses Harvey’s discovery of the\ncirculation of blood and makes clear that it could only have been\ndiscovered a posteriori. People have accepted Harvey’s\nhypothesis, Du Bos writes, because \n\nThis passage is clearly an endorsement of empiricism and a rejection\nof Cartesian rationalism. \n\nDu Bos makes a related claim in a discussion of physicians. A\nphysician may be a Cartesian while young, but he will end up as an\nempiricist. According to Du Bos, \n\nExperience will transform the wise physician into an empiricist.\nElsewhere, Du Bos says something similar about engineering, navigation\nand related sciences. He considers four modern scientific discoveries\n(the discovery of air pressure, the invention of the compass, the\ndevelopment of the printing press, and the invention of the telescope)\nand observes that all of these discoveries were due to the acquisition\nof new experiences. \n\nWhen Du Bos investigates any scientific matter, he proceeds in an\nempirical fashion. For example, he examines the question of why certain\neras have produced more geniuses than other periods. He begins by\nconsidering the hypothesis that a social cause is responsible for the\nproduction of geniuses. In particular, he considers the hypothesis that\nthe production of geniuses can be explained by reference to generous\npatrons. He refutes this hypothesis by giving examples of eras when\npatrons abounded but geniuses were scarce. Having empirically refuted\nthis hypothesis, he considers the hypothesis that genius has a natural\nor physical cause. Du Bos supports this hypothesis by attempting to\nfind a correlation between certain environmental, climatic, and dietary\nfactors and the production of genius. Du Bos’s views on the origin\nof genius were widely accepted in the first two thirds of the\neighteenth century. Herder, Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Winckelmann were\namong the important figures to adopt Du Bos’s views on climate\nand genius. \n\nDu Bos held that scientific investigation always involves some\nuncertainty. He wrote that “I distrust physical explanations,\nsince the imperfection of this science almost always makes guesswork\nnecessary” (2.2). According to Du Bos, a scientific hypothesis\nis only probable to some extent or another. He illustrates this view\nby reference to Harvey’s hypothesis concerning the circulation\nof blood. Du Bos writes that, “Most scholars of his\n[Harvey’s] time were persuaded by his views. It was as firmly\nand widely established as a scientific truth as something that is not\ndirectly observed can be.
