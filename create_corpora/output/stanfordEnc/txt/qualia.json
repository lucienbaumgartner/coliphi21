For example, I run my fingers\nover sandpaper, smell a skunk, feel a sharp pain in my finger, seem to\nsee bright purple, become extremely angry. In each of these cases, I\nam the subject of a mental state with a very distinctive subjective\ncharacter. There is something it is like for me to undergo\neach state, some phenomenology that it has. Philosophers often use the\nterm ‘qualia’ (singular ‘quale’) to refer to\nthe introspectively accessible, phenomenal aspects of our mental\nlives. In this broad sense of the term, it is difficult to deny that\nthere are qualia. Disagreement typically centers on which mental\nstates have qualia, whether qualia are intrinsic qualities of their\nbearers, and how qualia relate to the physical world both inside and\noutside the head. The status of qualia is hotly debated in philosophy\nlargely because it is central to a proper understanding of the nature\nof consciousness. Qualia are at the very heart of the mind-body\nproblem. \n\n\nThe entry that follows is divided into ten sections. The first\ndistinguishes various uses of the term ‘qualia’. The\nsecond addresses the question of which mental states have qualia. The\nthird section brings out some of the main arguments for the view that\nqualia are irreducible and non-physical. The remaining sections focus\non functionalism and qualia, the explanatory gap, qualia and\nintrospection, representational theories of qualia, qualia as\nintrinsic, nonrepresentational properties, relational theories of\nqualia and finally the issue of qualia and simple minds.\n\n(1) Qualia as phenomenal character. Consider your visual experience as\nyou stare at a bright turquoise color patch in a paint store. There is\nsomething it is like for you subjectively to undergo that experience.\nWhat it is like to undergo the experience is very different from what\nit is like for you to experience a dull brown color patch. This\ndifference is a difference in what is often called ‘phenomenal\ncharacter’. The phenomenal character of an experience is what it\nis like subjectively to undergo the experience. If you are told to\nfocus your attention upon the phenomenal character of your experience,\nyou will find that in doing so you are aware of certain qualities.\nThese qualities — ones that are accessible to you when you\nintrospect and that together make up the phenomenal character of the\nexperience are sometimes called ‘qualia’. C.S. Peirce\nseems to have had something like this in mind when he introduced the\nterm ‘quale’ into philosophy in 1866 (1866/1982, para\n223). \nThere are more restricted uses of the term ‘qualia’,\nhowever. \n(2) Qualia as properties of sense data. Consider a painting of a\ndalmatian. Viewers of the painting can apprehend not only its content\n(i.e., its representing a dalmatian) but also the colors, shapes, and\nspatial relations obtaining among the blobs of paint on the canvas. It\nhas sometimes been supposed that being aware or conscious of a visual\nexperience is like viewing an inner, non-physical picture or\nsense-datum. So, for example, on this conception, if I see a\ndalmatian, I am subject to a mental picture-like representation of a\ndalmatian (a sense-datum), introspection of which reveals to me both\nits content and its intrinsic, non-representational features\n(counterparts to the visual features of the blobs of paint on the\ncanvas). These intrinsic, non-representational features have been\ntaken by advocates of the sense-datum theory to be the sole\ndeterminants of what it is like for me to have the experience. In a\nsecond, more restricted sense of the term ‘qualia’, then,\nqualia are intrinsic, consciously accessible, non-representational\nfeatures of sense-data and other non-physical phenomenal objects that\nare responsible for their phenomenal character. Historically, the term\n‘qualia’ was first used in connection with the sense-datum\ntheory by C.I. Lewis in 1929. As Lewis used the term, qualia were\nproperties of sense-data themselves. \n(3) Qualia as intrinsic non-representational properties. There is\nanother established sense of the term ‘qualia’, which is\nsimilar to the one just given but which does not demand of qualia\nadvocates that they endorse the sense-datum theory. However sensory\nexperiences are ultimately analyzed — whether, for example, they\nare taken to involve relations to sensory objects or they are\nidentified with neural events or they are held to be physically\nirreducible events — many philosophers suppose that they have\nintrinsic, consciously accessible features that are\nnon-representational and that are solely responsible for their\nphenomenal character. These features, whatever their ultimate nature,\nphysical or non-physical, are often dubbed ‘qualia’. \nIn the case of visual experiences, for example, it is frequently\nsupposed that there is a range of visual qualia, where these are taken\nto be intrinsic features of visual experiences that (a) are accessible\nto introspection, (b) can vary without any variation in the\nrepresentational contents of the experiences, (c) are mental\ncounterparts to some directly visible properties of objects (e.g.,\ncolor), and (d) are the sole determinants of the phenomenal character\nof the experiences. This usage of ‘qualia’ has become\nperhaps the most common one in recent years. Philosophers who hold or\nhave held that there are qualia, in this sense of the term, include,\nfor example, Nagel (1974), Peacocke (1983) and Block (1990). \n(4) Qualia as intrinsic, nonphysical, ineffable properties. Some\nphilosophers (e.g, Dennett 1987, 1991) use the term\n‘qualia’ in a still more restricted way so that qualia are\nintrinsic properties of experiences that are also ineffable,\nnonphysical, and ‘given’ to their subjects incorrigibly\n(without the possibility of error). Philosophers who deny that there\nare qualia sometimes have in mind qualia as the term is used in this\nmore restricted sense (or a similar one). It is also worth mentioning\nthat sometimes the term ‘qualia’ is restricted to sensory\nexperiences by definition, while on other occasions it is allowed that\nif thoughts and other such cognitive states have phenomenal character,\nthen they also have qualia. Thus, announcements by philosophers who\ndeclare themselves opposed to qualia need to be treated with some\ncaution. One can agree that there are no qualia in the last three\nsenses I have explained, while still endorsing qualia in the standard\nfirst sense. \nIn the rest of this entry, we use the term ‘qualia’ in the\nvery broad way I did at the beginning of the entry. So, we take it for\ngranted that there are qualia. Later on, in section 8, we discuss\nspecifically the view of qualia as intrinsic, nonrepresentational\nproperties. \nThe following would certainly be included on my own list. (1)\nPerceptual experiences, for example, experiences of the sort involved\nin seeing green, hearing loud trumpets, tasting liquorice, smelling\nthe sea air, handling a piece of fur. (2) Bodily sensations, for\nexample, feeling a twinge of pain, feeling an itch, feeling hungry,\nhaving a stomach ache, feeling hot, feeling dizzy. Think here also of\nexperiences such as those present during orgasm or while running\nflat-out. (3) Felt reactions or passions or emotions, for example,\nfeeling delight, lust, fear, love, feeling grief, jealousy, regret.\n(4) Felt moods, for example, feeling elated, depressed, calm, bored,\ntense, miserable. (For more here, see Haugeland 1985, pp.\n230–235). \nShould we include any other mental states on the list? Galen Strawson\nhas claimed (1994) that there are such things as the\nexperience of understanding a sentence, the\nexperience of suddenly thinking of something, of suddenly\nremembering something, and so on. Moreover, in his view, experiences\nof these sorts are not reducible to associated sensory experiences\nand/or images. Strawson’s position here seems to be that\nthought-experience is a distinctive experience in its own right. He\nsays, for example: “Each sensory modality is an experiential\nmodality, and thought experience (in which understanding-experience\nmay be included) is an experiential modality to be reckoned alongside\nthe other experiential modalities” (p. 196). On Strawson’s\nview, then, some thoughts have qualia. (This is also the position of\nHorgan and Tienson (2002).)  \nThis view is controversial. One response is to claim that the\nphenomenal aspects of understanding derive largely from linguistic (or\nverbal) images, which have the phonological and syntactic structure of\nitems in the subject’s native language. These images frequently\neven come complete with details of stress and intonation. As we read,\nit is sometimes phenomenally as if we are speaking to ourselves.\n(Likewise when we consciously think about something without reading).\nWe often “hear” an inner voice. Depending upon the content\nof the passage, we may also undergo a variety of emotions and\nfeelings. We may feel tense, bored, excited, uneasy, angry. Once\nall these reactions are removed, together with the images of\nan inner voice and the visual sensations produced by reading, some\nwould say (myself included) that no phenomenology remains. \nIn any event, images and sensations of the above sorts are not always\npresent in thought. They are not essential to thought.\nConsider, for example, the thoughts involved in everyday visual\nrecognition (or the thoughts of creatures without a natural\nlanguage). \nWhat about desires, for example, my desire for a week’s holiday\nin Venice? It is certainly true that in some cases, there is an\nassociated phenomenal character. Often when we strongly desire\nsomething, we experience a feeling of being “pulled” or\n“tugged”. There may also be accompanying images in various\nmodalities. \nShould we include such propositional attitudes as feeling angry\nthat the house has been burgled or seeing that the\ncomputer is missing on the list? These seem best treated as\nhybrid or complex states, one component of which is essentially a\nphenomenal state and the other (a judgment or belief) is not. Thus, in\nboth cases, there is a constituent experience that is the real bearer\nof the relevant quale or qualia. \nThe literature on qualia is filled with thought-experiments of one\nsort or another. Perhaps the most famous of these is the case of Mary,\nthe brilliant color scientist. Mary, so the story goes (Jackson 1982),\nis imprisoned in a black and white room. Never having been permitted\nto leave it, she acquires information about the world outside from the\nblack and white books her captors have made available to her, from the\nblack and white television sets attached to external cameras, and from\nthe black and white monitor screens hooked up to banks of computers.\nAs time passes, Mary acquires more and more information about the\nphysical aspects of color and color vision. (For a real life case of a\nvisual scientist (Knut Nordby) who is an achromotope, see Sacks 1996,\nChapter 1.) Eventually, Mary becomes the world’s leading\nauthority on these matters. Indeed she comes to know all the\nphysical facts pertinent to everyday colors and color vision.  \nStill, she wonders to herself: What do people in the outside world\nexperience when they see the various colors? What is it\nlike for them to see red or green? One day her captors\nrelease her. She is free at last to see things with their real colors\n(and free too to scrub off the awful black and white paint that covers\nher body). She steps outside her room into a garden full of flowers.\n“So, that is what it is like to experience red,” she\nexclaims, as she sees a red rose. “And that,” she adds,\nlooking down at the grass, “is what it is like to experience\ngreen.” \nMary here seems to make some important discoveries. She seems to find\nout things she did not know before. How can that be, if, as seems\npossible, at least in principle, she has all the physical information\nthere is to have about color and color vision — if she knows all\nthe pertinent physical facts? \nOne possible explanation is that that there is a realm of subjective,\nphenomenal qualities associated with color, qualities the intrinsic\nnature of which Mary comes to discover upon her release, as she\nherself undergoes the various new color experiences. Before she left\nher room, she only knew the objective, physical basis of those\nsubjective qualities, their causes and effects, and various relations\nof similarity and difference. She had no knowledge of the subjective\nqualities in themselves. \nThis explanation is not available to the physicalist. If what it is\nlike for someone to experience red is one and the same as some\nphysical quality, then Mary already knows that while in her\nroom. Likewise, for experiences of the other colors. For Mary knows\nall the pertinent physical facts. What, then, can the physicalist\nsay? \nSome physicalists respond that knowing what it is like is know-how and\nnothing more. Mary acquires certain abilities, specifically in the\ncase of red, the ability to recognize red things by sight alone, the\nability to imagine a red expanse, the ability to remember the\nexperience of red. She does not come to know any new\ninformation, any new facts about color, any new qualities. This is the\nview of David Lewis (1990) and Lawrence Nemirow (1990). \nThe Ability Hypothesis, as it is often called, is more resilient than\nmany philosophers suppose (see Tye 2000, Chapter One). But it has\ndifficulty in properly accounting for our knowledge of what it is like\nto undergo experiences of determinate hues while we are undergoing\nthem. For example, I can know what it is like to experience red-17, as\nI stare at a rose of that color. Of course, I don’t know the hue\nas red-17. My conception of it is likely just that shade of\nred. But I certainly know what it is like to experience the hue\nwhile it is present. Unfortunately, I lack the abilities Lewis cites\nand so does Mary even after she leaves her cell. She is not able to\nrecognize things that are red-17 as red-17 by sight. Given the way\nhuman memory works and the limitations on it, she lacks the concept\nred-17. She has no mental template that is sufficiently fine-grained\nto permit her to identify the experience of red-17 when it comes\nagain. Presented with two items, one red-17 and the other red-18, in a\nseries of tests, she cannot say with any accuracy which experience her\nearlier experience of the rose matches. Sometimes she picks one; at\nother times she picks the other. Nor is she able afterwards to imagine\nthings as having hue, red-17, or as having that very shade of red the\nrose had; and for precisely the same reason. \nThe Ability Hypothesis appears to be in trouble. An alternative\nphysicalist proposal is that Mary in her room lacks certain\nphenomenal concepts, certain ways of thinking about or\nmentally representing color experiences and colors. Once she leaves\nthe room, she acquires these new modes of thought as she experiences\nthe various colors. Even so, the qualities the new concepts pick out\nare ones she knew in a different way in her room, for they are\nphysical or functional qualities like all others. \nOne problem this approach faces is that it seems to imply that Mary\ndoes not really make a new discovery when she says, “So, that is\nwhat it is like to experience red.” Upon reflection, however, it\nis far from obvious that this is really a consequence. For it is\nwidely accepted that concepts or modes of presentation are involved in\nthe individuation of thought-contents, given one sense of the term\n‘content’ — the sense in which thought-content is\nwhatever information that-clauses provide that suffices for the\npurposes of even the most demanding rationalizing explanation. In this\nsense, what I think, when I think that Cicero was an orator, is not\nwhat I think when I think that Tully was an orator. This is precisely\nwhy it is possible to discover that Cicero is Tully. The thought that\nCicero was an orator differs from the thought that Tully was an orator\nnot at the level of truth-conditions — the same singular\nproposition is partly constitutive of the content of both — but\nat the level of concepts or mode of presentation. The one thought\nexercises the concept Cicero; the other the concept\nTully. The concepts have the same reference, but they present\nthe referent in different ways and thus the two thoughts can play\ndifferent roles in rationalizing explanation. \nIt appears then that there is no difficulty in holding both that Mary\ncomes to know some new things upon her release, while already knowing\nall the pertinent real-world physical facts, even though the new\nexperiences she undergoes and their introspectible qualities are\nwholly physical. In an ordinary, everyday sense, Mary’s\nknowledge increases. And that, it may be contended, is all the\nphysicalist needs to answer the Knowledge Argument. (The term\n‘fact’, it should be mentioned, is itself ambiguous.\nSometimes it is used to pick out real-world states of affairs alone;\nsometimes it is used for such states of affairs under certain\nconceptualizations. When we speak of the physical facts above, we\nshould be taken to refer either to physical states of affairs alone or\nto those states of affairs under purely physical conceptualizations.\nFor more on ‘fact’, see Tye 1995.) \nSome philosophers insist that the difference between the old and the\nnew concepts in this case is such that there must be a difference in\nthe world between the properties these concepts stand for or denote\n(Jackson 1993, Chalmers 1996). Some of these properties Mary knew in\nher cell; others she becomes cognizant of only upon her release. This\nis necessary for Mary to make a real discovery: she must come to\nassociate with the experience of red new qualities she did not\nassociate with it in her room. The physicalist is committed to denying\nthis claim; for the new qualities would have to be non-physical. \nThe issues here are complex. What the physicalist really needs to\nsettle the issue is a theory of phenomenal concepts (a theory, that\nis, of the allegedly special concepts that are deployed from the first\nperson point of view when we recognize our experiences as being of\nsuch-and-such subjective types) which is itself compatible with\nphysicalism. There are proposals on offer (see, for example, Hill\n1991, Loar 1990, Levine 2000, Sturgeon 2000, Perry 2001, Papineau\n2002, Tye, 2003), but there is as yet no agreement as to the form such\na theory should take, and some philosophers contend that a proper\ntheory of phenomenal concepts shows that no satisfactory answer can be\ngiven by the physicalist to the example of Mary’s Room (Chalmers\n1999). Another possibility is that the very idea of a phenomenal\nconcept, conceived of as a concept very different in how it functions\nfrom concepts applied elsewhere, is itself confused. On this view,\nphysicalists who have appealed to phenomenal concepts to handle the\nexample of Mary’s Room have been barking up the wrong tree (Tye\n2009).  \nAnother famous anti-reductionist thought-experiment concerning qualia\nappeals to the possibility of zombies. A philosophical zombie is a\nmolecule by molecule duplicate of a sentient creature, a normal\nhuman-being, for example, but who differs from that creature in\nlacking any phenomenal consciousness. For me, as I lie on the\nbeach, happily drinking some wine and watching the waves, I undergo a\nvariety of visual, olfactory, and gustatory experiences. But my zombie\ntwin experiences nothing at all. He has no phenomenal consciousness.\nSince my twin is an exact physical duplicate of me, his inner\npsychological states will be functionally isomorphic with my\nown (assuming he is located in an identical environment). Whatever\nphysical stimulus is applied, he will process the stimulus in the same\nway as I do, and produce exactly the same behavioral responses.\nIndeed, on the assumption that non-phenomenal psychological states are\nfunctional states (that is, states definable in terms of their role or\nfunction in mediating between stimuli and behavior), my zombie twin\nhas just the same beliefs, thoughts, and desires as I do. He differs\nfrom me only with respect to experience. For him, there is nothing it\nis like to stare at the waves or to sip wine. \nThe hypothesis that there can be philosophical zombies is not normally\nthe hypothesis that such zombies are nomically possible, that\ntheir existence is consistent with the actual laws of nature. Rather\nthe suggestion is that zombie replicas of this sort are at least\nimaginable and hence metaphysically possible. \nPhilosophical zombies pose a serious threat to any sort of physicalist\nview of qualia. To begin with, if zombie replicas are metaphysically\npossible, then there is a simple argument that seems to show that\nphenomenal states are not identical with internal, objective, physical\nstates. Suppose objective, physical state P can occur without\nphenomenal state S in some appropriate zombie replica (in the\nmetaphysical sense of ‘can’ noted above). Intuitively\nS cannot occur without S. Pain, for example, cannot\nbe felt without pain. So, P has a modal property S\nlacks, namely the property of possibly occurring without\nS. So, by Leibniz’ Law (the law that for anything\nx and for anything y, if x is identical\nwith y then x and y share all the\nsame properties), S is not identical with P. \nSecondly, if a person microphysically identical with me, located in an\nidentical environment (both present and past), can lack any\nphenomenal experiences, then facts pertaining to experience and\nfeeling, facts about qualia, are not necessarily fixed or determined\nby the objective microphysical facts. And this the physicalist cannot\nallow, even if she concedes that phenomenally conscious states are not\nstrictly identical with internal, objective, physical states. For the\nphysicalist, whatever her stripe, must at least believe that the\nmicrophysical facts determine all the facts, that any world that was\nexactly like ours in all microphysical respects (down to the\nsmallest detail, to the position of every single boson, for example)\nwould have to be like our world in all respects (having identical\nmountains, lakes, glaciers, trees, rocks, sentient creatures, cities,\nand so on). \nOne well-known physicalist reply to the case of zombies (Loar 1990) is\nto grant that they are conceptually possible, or at least that there\nis no obvious contradiction in the idea of a zombie, while\ndenying that zombies are metaphysically possible. Since the\nanti-physicalist argument requires metaphysical possibility —\nmere conceptual possibility will not suffice — it now collapses.\nThat conceptual possibility is too weak for the\nanti-physicalist’s purposes (at least without further\nqualification and argument) is shown by the fact that it is\nconceptually possible that I am not Michael Tye (that I am an impostor\nor someone misinformed about his past) even though, given the actual\nfacts, it is metaphysically impossible. \nFunctionalism is the view that individual qualia have functional\nnatures, that the phenomenal character of, e.g., pain is one and the\nsame as the property of playing such-and-such a causal or\nteleofunctional role in mediating between physical inputs (e.g., body\ndamage) and physical outputs (e.g., withdrawal behavior). On this view\n(Lycan 1987), qualia are multiply physically realizable. Inner states\nthat are physically very different may nonetheless feel the same. What\nis crucial to what it is like is functional role, not underlying\nhardware.  \nThere are two famous objections to functionalist theories of qualia:\nthe Inverted Spectrum and the Absent Qualia Hypothesis. The first move\nin the former objection consists in claiming that you might see red\nwhen I see green and vice-versa; likewise for the other colors so that\nour color experiences are phenomenally inverted. This does not suffice\nto create trouble for the functionalist yet. For you and I are surely\nrepresentationally different here: for example, you have a visual\nexperience that represents red when I have one that represents green.\nAnd that representational difference brings with it a difference in\nour patterns of causal interactions with external things (and thereby\na functional difference). \nThis reply can be handled by the advocate of inverted qualia by\nswitching to a case in which we both have visual experiences with the\nsame representational contents on the same occasions while still\ndiffering phenomenally. Whether such cases are really metaphysically\npossible is open to dispute, however. Certainly, those philosophers\nwho are representationalists about qualia (see Section 7) would deny\ntheir possibility. Indeed, it is not even clear that such cases are\nconceptually possible (Harrison 1973, Hardin 1993, Tye 1995). But\nleaving this to one side, it is far from obvious that there would not\nhave to be some salient fine-grained functional differences between\nus, notwithstanding our gross functional identity. \nConsider a computational example. For any two numerical inputs,\nM and N, a given computer always produces as outputs\nthe product of M and N. There is a second computer\nthat does exactly the same thing. In this way, they are functionally\nidentical. Does it follow that they are running exactly the same\nprogram? Of course, not! There are all sorts of programs that will\nmultiply together two numbers. These programs can differ dramatically.\nAt one gross level the machines are functionally identical, but at\nlower levels the machines can be functionally different. \nIn the case of you and me, then, the opponent of inverted qualia can\nclaim that, even if we are functionally identical at a coarse level\n— we both call red things ‘red’, we both believe\nthat those things are red on the basis of our experiences, we both are\ncaused to undergo such experiences by viewing red things, etc. —\nthere are necessarily fine-grained differences in our internal\nfunctional organization. And that is why our experiences are\nphenomenally different. \nSome philosophers will no doubt respond that it is still imaginable\nthat you and I are functionally identical in all relevant\nrespects yet phenomenally different. But this claim presents a problem\nat least for those philosophers who oppose functionalism but who\naccept physicalism. For it is just as easy to imagine that there are\ninverted qualia in molecule-by-molecule duplicates (in the same\nexternal, physical settings) as it is to imagine inverted qualia in\nfunctional duplicates. If the former duplicates are really\nmetaphysically impossible, as the physicalist is committed to\nclaiming, why not the latter? Some further convincing argument needs\nto be given that the two cases are disanalogous. As yet, to my mind,\nno such argument has been presented. (Of course, this response does\nnot apply to those philosophers who take the view that qualia are\nirreducible, non-physical entities. However, these philosophers have\nother severe problems of their own. In particular, they face the\nproblem of phenomenal causation. Given the causal closure of the\nphysical, how can qualia make any difference? For more here, see Tye\n1995, Chalmers 1996). \nThe absent qualia hypothesis is the hypothesis that functional\nduplicates of sentient creatures are possible, duplicates that\nentirely lack qualia. For example, one writer (Block 1980) asks us to\nsuppose that a billion Chinese people are each given a two-way radio\nwith which to communicate with one another and with an artificial\n(brainless) body. The movements of the body are controlled by the\nradio signals, and the signals themselves are made in accordance with\ninstructions the Chinese people receive from a vast display in the sky\nwhich is visible to all of them. The instructions are such that the\nparticipating Chinese people function like individual neurons, and the\nradio links like synapses, so that together the Chinese people\nduplicate the causal organization of a human brain. Whether or not\nthis system, if it were ever actualized, would actually\nundergo any feelings and experiences, it seems coherent to suppose\nthat it might not. But if this is a real metaphysical possibility,\nthen qualia do not have functional essences. \nOne standard functionalist reply to cases like the China-body system\nis to bite the bullet and to argue that however strange it seems, the\nChina-body system could not fail to undergo qualia. The oddness of\nthis view derives, according to some functionalists (Lycan 1987), from\nour relative size. We are each so much smaller than the China-body\nsystem that we fail to see the forest for the trees. Just as a\ncreature the size of a neuron trapped inside a human head might well\nbe wrongly convinced that there could not be consciousness there, so\nwe too draw the wrong conclusion as we contemplate the China-body\nsystem. It has also been argued (e.g., by Shoemaker 1975) that any\nsystem that was a full functional duplicate of one of us would have to\nbe subject to all the same beliefs, including beliefs about its own\ninternal states. Thus the China-Body system would have to believe that\nit experiences pain; and if it had beliefs of this sort, then it could\nnot fail to be the subject of some experiences (and hence some states\nwith phenomenal character). If this reply is successful (for an\nupdated version of this reply and a new related thought experiment,\nsee Tye 2006), what it shows is that the property of having some\nphenomenal character or other has a functional essence. But it does\nnot show that individual qualia are functional in nature. Thus one\ncould accept that absent qualia are impossible while also holding that\ninverted spectra are possible (see, e.g., Shoemaker 1975). \nOur grasp of what it is like to undergo phenomenal states is supplied\nto us by introspection. We also have an admittedly incomplete grasp of\nwhat goes on objectively in the brain and the body. But there is, it\nseems, a vast chasm between the two. It is very hard to see how this\nchasm in our understanding could ever be bridged. For no matter how\ndeeply we probe into the physical structure of neurons and the\nchemical transactions which occur when they fire, no matter how much\nobjective information we come to acquire, we still seem to be left\nwith something that we cannot explain, namely, why and how\nsuch-and-such objective, physical changes, whatever they might be,\ngenerate so-and-so subjective feeling, or any subjective feeling at\nall.  \nThis is the famous “explanatory gap” for qualia (Levine\n1983, 2000). Some say that the explanatory gap is unbridgeable and\nthat the proper conclusion to draw from it is that there is a\ncorresponding gap in the world. Experiences and feelings have\nirreducibly subjective, non-physical qualities (Jackson 1993; Chalmers\n1996, 2005). Others take essentially the same position on the gap\nwhile insisting that this does not detract from a purely physicalist\nview of experiences and feelings. What it shows rather is that some\nphysical qualities or states are irreducibly subjective entities\n(Searle 1992). Others hold that the explanatory gap may one day be\nbridged but we currently lack the concepts to bring the subjective and\nobjective perspectives together. On this view, it may turn out that\nqualia are physical, but we currently have no clear conception as to\nhow they could be (Nagel 1974). Still others adamantly insist that the\nexplanatory gap is, in principle, bridgeable but not by us or by any\ncreatures like us. Experiences and feelings are as much a part of the\nphysical, natural world as life, digestion, DNA, or lightning. It is\njust that with the concepts we have and the concepts we are capable of\nforming, we are cognitively closed to a full, bridging explanation by\nthe very structure of our minds (McGinn 1991). \nAnother view that has been gaining adherents of late is that there is\na real, unbridgeable gap, but it has no consequences for the nature of\nconsciousness and physicalist or functionalist theories thereof. On\nthis view, there is nothing in the gap that should lead us to any\nbifurcation in the world between experiences and feelings on\nthe one hand and physical or functional phenomena on the other. There\naren’t two sorts of natural phenomena: the irreducibly\nsubjective and the objective. The explanatory gap derives from the\nspecial character of phenomenal concepts. These concepts\nmislead us into thinking that the gap is deeper and more troublesome\nthan it really is. \nOn one version of this view, phenomenal concepts are just indexical\nconcepts applied to phenomenal states via introspection (see Lycan\n1996). On an alternative version of the view, phenomenal concepts are\nvery special, first-person concepts different in kind from all others\n(see Tye 2003). This response to the explanatory gap obviously bears\naffinities to the second physicalist response sketched in Section 3 to\nthe Knowledge Argument. Unfortunately, if the appeal to phenomenal\nconcepts by the physicalist is misguided, then it cannot be used to\nhandle the gap. \nThere is no general agreement on how the gap is generated and what it\nshows. \nIn the past, philosophers have often appealed directly to\nintrospection on behalf of the view that qualia are intrinsic,\nnon-intentional features of experiences. Recently, a number of\nphilosophers have claimed that introspection reveals no such qualities\n(Harman 1990, Dretske 1995, Tye 1995, 2000). Suppose you are facing a\nwhite wall, on which you see a bright red, round patch of paint.\nSuppose you are attending closely to the color and shape of the patch\nas well as the background. Now turn your attention from what you see\nout there in the world before you to your visual experience. Focus\nupon your awareness of the patch as opposed to the\npatch of which you are aware. Do you find yourself suddenly\nacquainted with new qualities, qualities that are intrinsic to your\nvisual experience in the way that redness and roundness are qualities\nintrinsic to the patch of paint? According to some philosophers, the\nanswer to this question is a resounding ‘No’. As you look\nat the patch, you are aware of certain features out there in the\nworld. When you turn your attention inwards to your experience of\nthose features, you are aware that you are having an\nexperience of a certain sort but you aware of the very same\nfeatures; no new features of your experience are revealed. In this\nway, your visual experience is transparent or diaphanous. When you try\nto examine it, you see right through it, as it were, to the qualities\nyou were experiencing all along in being a subject of the experience,\nqualities your experience is of.  \nThis point holds good, according to the philosophers above, even if\nyou are hallucinating and there is no real patch of paint on the wall\nbefore you. Still you have an experience of there being a\npatch of paint out there with a certain color and shape. It’s\njust that this time your experience is a misrepresentation. And if you\nturn your attention inwards to your experience, you will\n‘see’ right through it again to those very same\nqualities. \nThese observations suggest that qualia, conceived of as the\nimmediately ‘felt’ qualities of experiences of\nwhich we are cognizant when we attend to them introspectively, do not\nreally exist. The qualities of which we are aware are not qualities of\nexperiences at all, but rather qualities that, if they are qualities\nof anything, are qualities of things in the world (as in the case of\nperceptual experiences) or of regions of our bodies (as in the case of\nbodily sensations). This is not to say that experiences do not have\nqualia. The point is that qualia are not qualities of experiences.\nThis claim, which will be developed further in the next section, is\ncontroversial and some philosophers deny outright the thesis of\ntransparency with respect to qualia (see Block 1991, 2000; Stoljar\n2004; Nida-Rümelin 2007). According to Block, for example, qualia\nare not presented to us in introspection as intrinsic, non-intentional\nproperties of our experiences. Still it does not follow from this that\nwe are not introspectively acquainted with such properties. For we do\nknow on the basis of introspection what it is like to undergo a visual\nexperience of blue, say. So, if what a state is like is a matter of\nwhich intrinsic, non-intentional properties it tokens, then obviously\nwe are introspectively aware of properties of this sort (in the de re\nsense of ‘of’). On this view, whether qualia are\nproperties of experiences (in particular, intrinsic, non-intentional\nproperties) is a theoretical matter. Introspection does not settle the\nmatter one way or the other. \nTalk of the ways things look and feel is intensional. If I have a red\nafter-image as a result of a flashbulb going off, the spot I\n‘see’ in front of the photographer’s face looks red,\neven though there is no such spot. If I live in a world in which all\nand only things that are purple are poisonous, it is still the case\nthat an object that looks purple to me does not thereby look poisonous\n(in the phenomenal sense of ‘looks’). If I feel a pain in\na leg, I need not even have a leg. My pain might be a pain in a\nphantom limb. Facts such as these have been taken to provide further\nsupport for the contention that some sort of representational account\nis appropriate for qualia.  \nIf qualia are not qualities of experiences, as some philosophers\nmaintain on the basis of an appeal to introspection, and the only\nqualities revealed in introspection are qualities represented by\nexperiences (qualities that, in the perceptual case, if they belong to\nanything, belong to external things), a natural representational\nproposal is that qualia are really representational contents of\nexperiences into which the represented qualities enter. This would\nalso explain why we talk of experiences *having* qualia or *having* a\nphenomenal character. For the representational content of an\nexperience is something the experience has; just as meaning is\nsomething a word has. Moreover, just as the meaning of a word is not a\nquality the word possesses, so the phenomenal character of an\nexperience is not a quality the experience possesses. \nIf qualia are representational contents, just which contents are\nthese? Obviously there can be differences in the representational\ncontents of experiences without any phenomenal difference. If you and\nI see a telescope from the same viewing angle, for example, then even\nif I do not recognize it as a telescope and you do (so that our\nexperiences differ representationally at this level), the way the\ntelescope looks to both of us is likely pretty much the same (in the\nphenomenal sense of ‘looks’). Likewise, if a child is\nviewing the same item from the same vantage point, her experience will\nlikely be pretty similar to yours and mine too. Phenomenally, our\nexperiences are all very much alike, notwithstanding certain\nhigher-level representational differences. This, according to some\nrepresentationalists, is because we all have experiences that\nrepresent to us the same 3-D surfaces, edges, colors, and\nsurface-shapes plus a myriad of other surface details. \nThe representation we share here has a content much like that of the 2\n1/2-D sketch posited by David Marr in his famous theory of vision\n(1982) to which further shape and color information has been appended\n(for details, see Tye 1995). This content is plausibly viewed as\nnonconceptual. It forms the output of the early, largely modular\nsensory processing and the input to one or another system of\nhigher-level cognitive processing. Representationalists sometimes\nclaim that it is here at this level of content that qualia are to be\nfound (see Dretske 1995, Tye 1995, 2000; for an opposing\nrepresentational view, see McDowell 1994). \nOne worry for this view is that if qualia are to be handled in terms\nof representational content, then there had better be a content that\nis shared by veridical visual experiences and their hallucinatory\ncounterparts. Disjunctivists have disputed the supposition that there\nis a common content (see, e.g., Hinton 1973, Martin 1997, Snowdon\n1990). Perhaps veridical experiences have only singular contents and\nhallucinatory experiences have gappy contents or no content at all\n(for an extended discussion of visual experience and content, see\nPautz 2010, Siegel 2011). \nAn alternative possibility is that qualia are properties represented\nby experiences. On this view, there need be no common content shared\nby veridical experiences and their hallucinatory counterparts. It\nsuffices that the same properties be represented. Of course, such a\nview requires that a further account be provided of what it is that\nmakes a property represented by an experience a quale. \nSome philosophers try to ground qualia in modes of representation\ndeployed by experiences within their representational contents. On one\nversion of this view, visual experiences not only represent the\nexternal world but also represent themselves (for a recent collection\nof essays elaboarating this view, see Kriegel and Williford 2006). For\nexample, my current visual experience of a red object not only\nrepresents the object as red (this is my focal awareness) but also\nrepresents itself as red (this is normally a kind of peripheral\nawareness I have of my experience). When I introspect, the experience\nalone provides me with awareness of itself — no higher order\nthought is necessary. What the experience is like for me is supposedly\nits redness, where this is a mode of representation my experience uses\nto represent real world redness. \nThis view is incompatible with the phenomenon of transparency (see\nsection 6) and it is very close to the classic qualiaphile view,\naccording to which when the subject introspects, she is aware of the\ntoken experience and its phenomenal properties. The new twist is that\nthis awareness uses the token experience itself and one of its\ncontents. \nRepresentationalists about qualia are often also externalists about\nrepresentational content (but not always — see, for example,\nChalmers 2004). On this view, what a given experience represents is\nmetaphysically determined at least, in part, by factors in the\nexternal environment. Thus, it is usually held, microphysical twins\ncan differ with respect to the representational contents of their\nexperiences. If these differences in content are of the right sort\nthen, according to the wide representationalist, microphysical twins\ncannot fail to differ with respect to the phenomenal\ncharacter of their experiences. What makes for a difference in\nrepresentational content in microphysical duplicates is some external\ndifference, some connection between the subjects and items in their\nrespective environments. The generic connection is sometimes called\n‘tracking’, though there is no general agreement as to in\nwhat exactly tracking consists. \nOn wide representationalism, qualia (like meanings) ain’t in the\nhead. The classic, Cartesian-based picture of experience and its\nrelation to the world is thus turned upside down. Qualia are not\nintrinsic qualities of inner ideas of which their subjects are\ndirectly aware, qualities that are necessarily shared by internal\nduplicates however different their environments may be. Rather, they\nare representational contents certain inner states possess, contents\nwhose nature is fixed at least in part by certain external relations\nbetween individuals and their environments (Byrne and Tye 2006; for an\nopposing but still representationalist view, see Pautz 2006). \nRepresentationalism, as presented so far, is an identity thesis with\nrespect to qualia: qualia are supposedly one and the same as certain\nrepresentational contents. Sometimes it is held instead that\nqualia are one and the same as certain representational\nproperties of experiences (or properties represented in\nexperiences); and sometimes it is is argued that these\nrepresentational properties are themselves irreducible (Siewert 1998).\nThere is also a weaker version of representationalism, according to\nwhich it is metaphysically necessary that experiences exactly alike\nwith respect to their representational contents are exactly alike with\nrespect to their qualia. Obviously, this supervenience thesis leaves\nopen the further question as to the essential nature of qualia. \nFor further discussion, see Section 3 of the entry on\n representational theory of consciousness.\n Objections to representationalism are covered in the next\nsection. \nAs noted in section 1, the term ‘qualia’ is sometimes used\nfor intrinsic nonrepresentational, consciously accessible properties\nof experience. Representationalists deny that there are qualia in this\nsense, while identifying qualia in the broad sense (that is, qualia as\nphenomenal character) with representational properties. However, some\nphilosophers hold that there are qualia in the sense of intrinsic\nnonrepresentational properties of experience. These philosophers deny\nrepresentationalism, and identify qualia in the broad sense with\nintrinsic nonrepresentational properties of experience. This view is\nthe subject of the present section. \nAs noted earlier, some philosophers deny that experience is\ntransparent. They claim that introspection does not show that\nexperiences lack introspectible, intrinsic, nonrepresentational\nproperties. Further, they insist that representationalism encounters\ndecisive objections. These objections may be seen as making up one\npillar in the main foundation for the view that experiences have\nqualia, conceived of now as intrinsic, nonrepresentational properties.\nThe second pillar consists in what is sometimes called “the\ncommon kind assumption”, namely that veridical and hallucinatory\nexperiences sometimes share the same phenomenal character (have the\nsame qualia). This assumption is accepted by all the advocates of the\nviews discussed so far but it is denied by advocates of relational\ntheories of qualia (see section 9). \nObjections to representational views of qualia often take the form of\nputative counter-examples. One class of these consists of cases in\nwhich, it is claimed, experiences have the same representational\ncontent but different phenomenal character. Christopher Peacocke\nadduces examples of this sort in his 1983. According to some (e.g.,\nBlock 1990, Shoemaker forthcoming), the Inverted Spectrum also\nsupplies an example that falls into this category. Another class is\nmade up of problem cases in which allegedly experiences have different\nrepresentational contents (of the relevant sort) but the same\nphenomenal character. Ned Block’s Inverted Earth example (1990)\nis of this type. The latter cases only threaten strong\nrepresentationalism, the former are intended to refute\nrepresentationalism in both its strong and weaker forms.\nCounter-examples are also sometimes given in which supposedly\nexperience of one sort or another is present but in which there is no\nstate with representational content. Swampman (Davidson 1986) —\nthe molecule by molecule replica of one of us, formed accidentally by\nthe chemical reaction that occurs in a swamp when a partially\nsubmerged log is hit by lightning — is one such counter-example,\naccording to some philosophers. But there are more mundane cases.\nConsider the exogenous feeling of depression. That, it may seem, has\nno representational content. Likewise, the exogenous feeling of\nelation. Yet these experiences certainly differ phenomenally. \nThere isn’t space to go through all these objections. We briefly\ndiscuss just one: Inverted Earth. Inverted Earth is an imaginary\nplanet, on which things have complementary colors to the colors of\ntheir counterparts on Earth. The sky is yellow, grass is red, ripe\ntomatoes are green, and so on. The inhabitants of Inverted Earth\nundergo psychological attitudes and experiences with inverted\nintentional contents relative to those of people on Earth. They think\nthat the sky is yellow, see that grass is red, etc. However, they call\nthe sky ‘blue’, grass ‘green’, ripe tomatoes\n‘red’, etc. just as we do. Indeed, in all respects\nconsistent with the alterations just described, Inverted Earth is as\nmuch like Earth as possible. \nIn Block’s original version of the tale, mad scientists insert\ncolor-inverting lenses in your eyes and take you to Inverted Earth,\nwhere you are substituted for your Inverted Earth twin or\ndoppelganger. Upon awakening, you are aware of no difference, since\nthe inverting lenses neutralize the inverted colors. You think that\nyou are still where you were before. What it is like for you when you\nsee the sky or anything else is just what it was like on earth. But\nafter enough time has passed, after you have become sufficiently\nembedded in the language and physical environment of Inverted Earth,\nyour intentional contents will come to match those of the other\ninhabitants. You will come to believe that the sky is yellow, for\nexample, just as they do. Similarly, you will come to have a visual\nexperience that represents the sky as yellow. For the experiential\nstate you now undergo, as you view the sky, is the one that, in you,\nnow normally tracks yellow things. So, the later you will come to be\nsubject to inner states that are intentionally inverted relative to\nthe inner states of the earlier you, while the phenomenal aspects of\nyour experiences will remain unchanged.  \nPerhaps the simplest reply that can be made with respect to this\nobjection is to deny that there really is any change in normal\ntracking with respect to color, at least as far as your experiences\ngo. “Normal”, after all, has both teleological and\nnonteleological senses. If what an experience normally tracks is what\nnature designed it to track, what it has as its biological purpose to\ntrack, then shifting environments from Earth to Inverted Earth will\nmake no difference to normal tracking and hence no difference to the\nrepresentational contents of your experiences. The sensory state that\nnature designed in your species to track blue in the setting in which\nyour species evolved will continue to do just that even if through\ntime, on Inverted Earth, in that alien environment, it is usually\ncaused in you by looking at yellow things. \nThe suggestion that tracking is teleological in character, at least\nfor the case of basic experiences, goes naturally with the plausible\nview that states like feeling pain or having a visual sensation of red\nare phylogenetically fixed (Dretske 1995). However, it encounters\nserious difficulties with respect to the Swampman case mentioned\nabove. On a cladistic conception of species, Swampman is not human.\nIndeed, lacking any evolutionary history, he belongs to no species at\nall. His inner states play no teleological role. Nature did not design\nany of them to do anything. So, if phenomenal character is a certain\nsort of teleo-representational content, as some representationalists\nhold, then Swampman has no experiences and no qualia. This, for many\nphilosophers, is very difficult to believe. \nThere are alternative replies available (see Lycan 1996, Tye 2000) in\nconnection with the Inverted Earth problem. These involve either\ndenying that qualia do remain constant with the switch to Inverted\nEarth or arguing that a non-teleological account of sensory content\nmay be elaborated, under which qualia stay the same. \nAs noted above, the second pillar in the foundation of the view that\nqualia are intrinsic, nonrepresentational properties of experiences is\nthe common kind assumption. Those philosophers who accept this\nassumption see it (in the perceptual case) as providing the simplest,\nbest explanation of the fact that hallucinations and veridical\nperceptions sometimes seem exactly alike to their subjects. It is\ngranted, of course, that it does not follow that there is something\ncommon between hallucinations and perceptions in such cases from the\nfact that they seem alike. Nonetheless, it is a challenge to those who\nreject this assumption (see section 9) to provide a better\nexplanation. \nRelational theories of qualia typically begin with the naive realist\nthesis that in normal circumstances perceivers are directly aware of\nthe objects around them and various properties that they have. It is\nthen proposed that since perceivers are also directly aware of what\ntheir experiences are like, the phenomenal character of their\nexperiences in such cases is to be understood in terms of the relevant\nobjects and their properties along with the viewpoint from which they\nare being observed. More precisely, it is urged that the phenomenal\ncharacter is constituted by the objects that the perceiver sees, some\nof their properties and how they are arranged relative to the\nviewer.(Campbell 2002)  \nIn later work, Campbell (2009) allows that the viewer’s\n‘standpoint’ needs to be factored into phenomenal character too.\nThe standpoint a perceiver occupies includes much more than just the\negocentric frame of the perceiver. It includes the sense modality used\nto perceive, the time and place of the perceiving as well as the\ndistance from the perceived object, the orientation of the perceiver\nrelative to the object, and the temporal dynamics of the experience.\nConsciousness of an object, for Campbell, now consists in a\nthree-place relation between a perceiver, an object, and a standpoint.\nWith what exactly phenomenal character itself is to be identified, on\nthis proposal, is unclear.  \nBill Brewer (2011) agrees with Campbell that a third relatum is needed\nin naïve realist accounts of perceptual experience, where the third\nrelatum includes the sense modality of the experience, the\nspatio-temporal point of view, and other relevant circumstances of\nperception but he does not specify what exactly these circumstances\nare. William Fish (2009) takes a similar position, arguing that the\nthird element should include idiosyncracies of the perceiver’s\nvisual system as well as attentional facts about the perceiver since\ntwo ordinary perceivers viewing the same object from the same position\nmay nonetheless differ in the character of their visual experiences,\ndepending upon how good their eyesight is (for example) and how they\ndistribute their attention. \nOf course, when one is (completely) hallucinating, there are no\nobjects that one sees. So, relationism cannot allow that the\nphenomenal character in this case is the same as in the veridical\ncase. Accordingly, relationists reject what was called in the last\nsection “the common kind assumption”. One possible view\nconsistent with relationism is that in hallucinatory cases the\nphenomenal character is a matter of the representational content of\nthe experience, as is claimed on some versions of representationalism.\nAnother view, held by some relationists, is that there is nothing more\nto the phenomenal character of a hallucinatory experience — for\nexample, an experience of a red triangle — than its being\nindiscriminable or indistinguishable from a veridical experience of a\nred triangle (Martin 2004, Fish 2009). On this view, in giving a\nmental characterization of a hallucinatory experience, there is\nnothing more to be said than that it has a certain relational and\nepistemological property, namely that of being indiscriminable from\nthe relevant perceptual experience. \nSometimes relationists try to motivate their view by arguing that\nsince the seen objects are constituents of veridical visual\nexperiences and they are not in the case of hallucinatory experiences,\nthe experiences in the two cases must themselves be different.\nHowever, even if this is correct, it does not follow that they cannot\nshare the same phenomenal character. What follows is rather that if\nthey do share a common phenomenal character, then the conscious\nexperiences are not to be individuated (solely) by that phenomenal\ncharacter. \nOne problem facing Martin’s relational account of hallucinatory\nphenomenal character is that of cognitively unsophisticated\nperceivers. Dogs can hallucinate but they lack the cognitive\nwherewithal to judge that their hallucinatory experiences of bones are\nthe same or different from their veridical experiences of squirrels.\nIn at least one clear sense of ‘indiscriminable’, then,\ntheir hallucinatory experiences of bones are indiscriminable to them\nfrom their veridical experiences of squirrels. But the phenomenal\ncharacter of these experiences is certainly different. (For a\ndiscussion of this problem and a response to it, see Martin 2004. For\ncriticisms, see Siegel 2009.) \nAnother problem for the relational view is that it cannot easily\nhandle cases of normal misperception, for example, the Muller-Lyer\nillusion. Campbell tells us that idiosyncrasies of the perceiver may\naffect phenomenal character, but he has no account to offer of cases\nin which something looks other than it is even to normal observers in\nnormal circumstances. Here the scene before the eyes fails to capture\nthe phenomenology. Brewer says that illusions are to be accounted for\nin terms of visually relevant similarities to paradigms of a kind of\nwhich the perceived object is not an instance. In the case of the\nMuller-Lyer, the paradigm is a pair of lines one longer and more\ndistant than its plane, the other shorter and less distant. This\nproposal encounters various potential difficulties (Pautz 2010). For\nexample, in the waterfall illusion, the water appears to be moving and\nnot moving at the same time. Here there are no suitable paradigms in\nthe real world. (See the entry on\n the disjunctive theory of perception.)\n  \nDo frogs have qualia? Or fish? What about honey bees? Somewhere down\nthe phylogenetic scale phenomenal consciousness ceases. But where? It\nis sometimes supposed that once we begin to reflect upon much simpler\nbeings than ourselves — snails, for example — we are left\nwith nothing physical or structural that we could plausibly take to\nhelp us determine whether they are phenomenally conscious (Papineau\n1994). There is really no way of our knowing if spiders are\nsubject to states with qualia, as they spin their webs, or if fish\nundergo any phenomenal experiences, as they swim about in the sea.\n \nRepresentationalism has the beginnings of an answer to the above\nquestions. If what it is for a state to have phenomenal character is\n(very roughly) that it be a state that (i) carries information about\ncertain features, internal or external, and (ii) is such that this\ninformation stands ready and available to make a direct difference to\nbeliefs and desires (or belief- and desire-like states), then\ncreatures that are incapable of reasoning, of changing their behavior\nin light of assessments they make, based upon information provided to\nthem by sensory stimulation of one sort or another, are not\nphenomenally conscious. Tropistic organisms, on this view, feel and\nexperience nothing. They have no qualia. They are full-fledged\nunconscious automata or zombies, rather as blindsight subjects are\nrestricted unconscious automata or partial zombies with respect to a\nrange of visual stimuli. \nConsider, for example, the case of plants. There are many different\nsorts of plant behavior. Some plants climb, others eat flies, still\nothers catapult out seeds. Many plants close their leaves at night.\nThe immediate cause of these activities is something internal to the\nplants. Seeds are ejected because of the hydration or dehydration of\nthe cell walls in seed pods. Leaves are closed because of water\nmovement in the stems and petioles of the leaves, itself induced by\nchanges in the temperature and light. These inner events or states are\nsurely not phenomenal. There is nothing it is like to be a Venus Fly\nTrap or a Morning-Glory. \nThe behavior of plants is inflexible. It is genetically determined\nand, therefore, not modifiable by learning. Natural selection has\nfavored the behavior, since historically it has been beneficial to the\nplant species. But it need not be now. If, for example, flies start to\ncarry on their wings some substance that sickens Venus Fly Traps for\nseveral days afterwards, this will not have any effect on the plant\nbehavior with respect to flies. Each Venus Fly Trap will continue to\nsnap at flies as long as it has the strength to do so. \nPlants do not learn from experience. They do not acquire beliefs and\nchange them in light of things that happen to them. Nor do they have\nany desires. To be sure, we sometimes speak as if they do. We say that\nthe wilting daffodils are just begging to be watered. But we recognize\nfull well that this is a harmless façon de parler. What we mean\nis that the daffodils need water. There is here no\ngoal-directed behavior, no purpose, nothing that is the result of any\nlearning, no desire for water. \nPlants, on the representational view, are not subject to any qualia.\nNothing that goes on inside them is poised to make a direct difference\nto what they believe or desire, since they have no beliefs or\ndesires. \nReasoning of the above sort can be used to make a case that even\nthough qualia do not extend to plants and paramecia, qualia are very\nwidely distributed in nature (see Tye 1997, 2000). Of course, such a\ncase requires decisions to be made about the attribution of beliefs\nand desires (or belief- and desire-like states) to much simpler\ncreatures. And such decisions are likely to be controversial in some\ncases. Moreover, representationalism itself is a very controversial\nposition. The general topic of the origins of qualia is not one on\nwhich philosophers have said a great deal. (For a general,\nwide-ranging discussion of this issue that is neutral on the nature of\nqualia, see Tye 2016.) ","contact.mail":"mtye@mail.utexas.edu","contact.domain":"mail.utexas.edu"}]
